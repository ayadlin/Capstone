Abstract
Drug resistance invariably limits the clinical efficacy of targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors
against cancer1,2. Here we show that targeted therapy with BRAF, ALK, or EGFR kinase
inhibitors induces a complex network of secreted signals in drug-stressed melanoma and lung
adenocarcinoma cells. This therapy-induced secretome (TIS) stimulates the outgrowth,
dissemination, and metastasis of drug-resistant cancer cell clones and supports the survival of
drug-sensitive cancer cells, contributing to incomplete tumour regression. The vemurafenib

reactive secretome in melanoma is driven by down-regulation of the transcription factor FRA1. In
situ transcriptome analysis of drug-resistant melanoma cells responding to the regressing tumour
microenvironment revealed hyperactivation of multiple signalling pathways, most prominently the
AKT pathway. Dual inhibition of RAF and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways blunted the outgrowth of
the drug-resistant cell population in BRAF mutant melanoma tumours, suggesting this
combination therapy as a strategy against tumour relapse. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of
oncogenic drivers induces vast secretome changes in drug-sensitive cancer cells, paradoxically
establishing a tumour microenvironment that supports the expansion of drug-resistant clones, but
is susceptible to combination therapy.

Kinase inhibitors such as vemurafenib, erlotinib or crizotinib have shown clinical efficacy in
melanoma with BRAF mutations, or in lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations or ALK
translocations, respectively3–6. Though complete responses are rare, the vast majority of
patients show partial tumour regression or disease stabilization. However, drug resistance
invariably develops and most patients progress within 6–12 months3–16, representing a
common complication of targeted therapies that hampers long-term treatment success. The
rapid emergence of clinical drug resistance may be facilitated by a small number of preexisting cancer cells that are intrinsically resistant or poised to quickly adapt to drug
treatment17–19. How these minority clones of drug-resistant cells react to the dramatic
changes in the microenvironment during tumour regression is not known. A better
understanding of this process could lead to treatments that improve the efficacy of current
targeted anti-cancer drugs.

In order to model therapeutic targeting of heterogeneous tumour cell populations in vivo, we
mixed a small percentage of vemurafenib-resistant A375 human melanoma cells (A375R),
labelled with a TK-GFP-Luciferase vector (TGL), together with a majority of non-labelled,
vemurafenib-sensitive A375 cells, and injected the admixture (A375/A375R, 99.95/0.05%)
subcutaneously in mice (Extended Data Fig. 1a). After the tumours were established, we
treated the mice with vemurafenib or vehicle, and monitored the growth of resistant cells by
bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in vivo (Fig. 1a). While vemurafenib treatment decreased the
volume of sensitive tumours (A375 alone) (Extended Data Fig. 1b), the number of admixed
resistant cells in regressing tumours (A375/A375R) significantly increased compared to
vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1b). GFP staining confirmed increased numbers of resistant
cells in regressing tumours, and EdU or BrdU staining confirmed their increased
proliferation rate compared to the vehicle treated controls (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1c,
d). Tumours comprised of only resistant cells showed no growth difference when treated
with vehicle or vemurafenib (Fig. 1d), indicating that the growth advantage of resistant cells
in regressing tumours was not caused by direct effects of vemurafenib on cancer or stromal
cells.
Treatment of mixed A375/A375R tumours with dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor (RAFi),
or doxycycline-induced knockdown of BRAF had similar effects (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g).
In line with these findings, A375R cells co-implanted with other vemurafenib-sensitive
melanoma cell lines (Colo800, LOX, and UACC62) also showed an up to 8-fold growth
increase compared to vehicle-treated control groups (Fig. 1e). Growth acceleration of the

resistant population in a regressing tumour was also observed in the patient-derived8
melanoma cell line M249 and its vemurafenib-resistant derivative M249R4, driven by an
NRAS mutation, a clinically relevant resistance mechanism (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1h).
In immunocompetent mice, vemurafenib treatment of tumours formed by melanoma cell
lines derived from BRAFV600E/CDKN2A−/−/PTEN−/− mice (YUMM1.1, YUMM1.7) also
promoted growth of the admixed vemurafenib-resistant cells (YUMM 1.7R, B16) (Extended
Data Fig. 1i, j).

Crizotinib or erlotinib treated mice harbouring tumours formed by ALK-driven (H3122) or
EGFR-driven (HCC827) human lung adenocarcinoma cells, respectively, admixed with
minority clones of intrinsically resistant cells from the same cell lineage (lung
adenocarcinoma cells H2030, PC9) or melanoma cells (A375R) also led to increased
outgrowth of the resistant cells (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1k–m). Local growth
acceleration of resistant cells in the regressing subcutaneous tumours resulted in higher lung
metastatic burden (Fig. 1f). Thus, drug-resistant cancer cells benefit from therapeutic
targeting of surrounding drug-sensitive cells.

Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) can infiltrate and colonize tumours. This phenomenon,
termed self-seeding20, may contribute to the distribution of resistant clones to multiple
metastatic sites. Mice implanted with sensitive A375 tumours were treated with vehicle or
vemurafenib, and intracardially injected with TGL-labelled A375R cells (Fig. 1g). A375R
cells were more efficiently attracted to vemurafenib-treated regressing tumours compared to
vehicle-treated controls with 95% (21/22) and 12.5% (2/16) efficiency, respectively,
exhibiting substantial accumulation of resistant cells in regressing tumours by day 5 (Fig.
1g, Extended Data Fig. 1n). To evaluate the contribution of seeding by resistant CTCs to
disease relapse, we intracardially injected resistant A375R cells or vehicle into tumour
bearing mice and compared the tumour volume during vemurafenib treatment (Fig. 1h).
Whereas the unseeded tumours in the control group showed extensive tumour regression,
seeding by A375R cells led to rapid tumour relapse (Fig. 1h). These results suggest that
tumours regressing on targeted therapy are potent attractors of resistant CTCs that may
contribute to rapid tumour progression.

Tumours consist of a complex microenvironment composed of immune, stromal, and cancer
cells21. Soluble mediators from this microenvironment can foster cancer growth and therapy
resistance13,14,22–24. Considering that drug-sensitive cancer cells are the main population
affected by targeted therapy, we hypothesized that signals derived from sensitive cancer
cells in response to kinase inhibitors drive the outgrowth of drug-resistant cells. To test this
hypothesis, we established an in vitro co-culture system and monitored the growth of TGLexpressing resistant cells (A375R, H2030) in the absence or presence of sensitive cells
treated with kinase inhibitors or vehicle (Fig. 2a). Mimicking our in vivo findings, co-culture
with vemurafenib-, crizotinib-, or erlotinib-treated sensitive cells significantly enhanced the
growth of resistant cancer cells (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a–c).
We derived conditioned media (CM) from vemurafenib-sensitive melanoma cells cultured in
the absence (CM-vehicle) or presence of vemurafenib (CM-vemurafenib). CM-vemurafenib
accelerated the proliferation of drug-resistant cells, with different clinically relevant

resistance mechanisms, as determined by cell viability assays and Ki67 staining (Fig. 2b,
Extended Data Fig. 2d–f). Similarly, CM from crizotinib- or erlotinib-treated sensitive lung
adenocarcinoma cells stimulated proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells with intrinsic or
acquired resistance (Fig. 2c) and across different cell lineages (Extended Data Fig. 2g). In
addition, CM-vemurafenib elicited increased cell migration in trans-well migration and
monolayer gap-closing assays (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 2h–j). CM-vemurafenib was also
active on vemurafenib-sensitive cancer cells, increasing survival and suppressing the
apoptotic caspase activity up to 100-fold in these cells when treated with vemurafenib in
vitro (Fig. 2e, f). Since all biologically active CM were harvested prior to cell death or
senescence, it is likely that the secretome is actively produced as a result of oncogene
inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 2l, m). These results demonstrate that BRAF, ALK, and
EGFR mutant cells respond to therapeutic stress under targeted therapy by secreting factors
that support the survival of drug sensitive cells and accelerate the growth of drug-resistant
minority clones. The effects of this reactive secretome may augment previously reported
resistance mechanisms including relief of feedback inhibition of intracellular signaling11,25,
up-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases26, or the supply of stromal cytokines14 that protect
the drug-sensitive cells.

To identify relevant components and regulators of the reactive secretome, we analysed gene
expression changes in sensitive A375 melanoma cells at different time points after
vemurafenib exposure in vitro. After 6h on vemurafenib, 473 genes showed altered
expression and pathway analysis revealed that these genes were enriched for transcriptional
regulators (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Table 1). After 48h, more
than one third of the transcriptome was differentially expressed (>5000 genes; 405 genes
encoding for proteins in the extracellular region GO:0005576), significantly overlapping
with the gene expression changes of A375 tumours in vivo after 5 days of vemurafenib
treatment (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 3c). Similar extensive gene expression changes
were observed in Colo800 and UACC62 melanoma cells treated with vemurafenib and
H3122 lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with crizotinib (Extended Data Fig 3d). Despite
different cell lineages, different oncogenic drivers, and different targeted therapies we
observed a significant overlap between the secretome of melanoma and lung
adenocarcinoma cells (p<9.11E–5) (Extended Data Fig. 3e–h, Supplementary Table 1).
Furthermore, changes in the secretome of vemurafenib-sensitive melanoma cells coincided
with changes in the immune cell composition (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b), and with changes
of soluble mediators derived from murine stromal cells such as IGF1 and HGF (Extended
Data Fig. 4c, d). These data indicate a therapy-induced secretome (TIS), a response that
consists of many up- and down-regulated secreted factors, permeates the regressing tumour
microenvironment and stimulates cancer cells, likely also stromal cells.
To identify molecular drivers of the A375-TIS in response to vemurafenib, we integrated the
data of differentially expressed transcription factors after 6h of vemurafenib treatment with
the transcription factor binding motifs that were enriched at the promoters of differentially
expressed genes in the secretome after 48h (Fig. 3a, b). This analysis highlighted FRA1
(FOSL1), a member of the AP1 transcription factor complex and effector of the ERK
pathway27, as one of the putative upstream regulators of the TIS (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

FRA1 was down-regulated in all drug-sensitive cells, but not in resistant cells, treated with
vemurafenib, crizotinib, and erlotinib (Fig. 3c, d, Extended Data Fig. 5b–d). Biopsies from
melanoma patients early during RAFi treatment confirmed vemurafenib-induced FRA1
down-regulation in clinical samples (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 5e, Extended Data Table
1).

Author Manuscript

In order to test the functional role of FRA1 in modulating the TIS, we used RNAi to inhibit
FRA1 expression. Co-culture and conditioned media assays using A375-shFRA1 cells
showed similar growth accelerating and chemotactic activity on A375R cells as vemurafenib
treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). In line with these results, FRA1 knockdown in A375
cells induced transcriptional changes similar to those induced by vemurafenib (Extended
Data Fig. 6e). A375R cells co-implanted with A375-shFRA1 or UACC62-shFRA1 cells also
demonstrated increased growth in vivo (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 6f). A375-shFRA1
tumours attracted significantly more resistant cells from the circulation than tumours
expressing the control vector (Fig. 3g). Thus, FRA1 down-regulation drives the induction of
the tumour-promoting secretome of vemurafenib-treated cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of the reactive secretome on the drug-resistant tumour subpopulation
in a regressing tumour, we expressed the ribosomal protein L10a fused with green
fluorescent protein (EGFP-RPL10a) in A375R cells, allowing the specific retrieval of
transcripts from A375R cells by polysome immunoprecipitation for subsequent RNAseq
analysis28 (Fig. 4a). In line with the in vivo phenotype of accelerated growth, the gene
expression pattern of resistant cells in the regressing microenvironment was enriched for
biological processes involved in cell viability, proliferation, and cell movement (Extended
Data Fig. 7a). Pathway analysis of the expression data suggested activation of several
pathways including PI3K/AKT, BMP-SMAD and NFkB (Fig. 4b). The hyperactivity of the
PI3K/AKT pathway in this context also suggested a potential vulnerability of the cells to
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The pathway analysis-based prediction of
PI3K/AKT activation was also reflected at the protein level in both resistant and sensitive
cells in the presence of CM-vemurafenib in vitro and under vemurafenib treatment in vivo
(Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 7c, d). Moreover, PI3K/AKT emerged as the dominant TIS
responsive pathway in a targeted immunoblot analysis of survival pathways in vitro
(Extended Data Fig. 7e).

Author Manuscript

The TIS contained many mediators directly or indirectly activating the AKT pathway.
Positive mediators that were up-regulated during therapy included IGF1, EGF, ANGPTL7,
and PDGFD, each of which activated the AKT pathway in vitro (Fig. 4d). IGF1, one of the
most potent activators of the AKT pathway is also abundantly expressed in the tumor stroma
and is further up-regulated during targeted therapy (Extended Data Fig. 4c, 7f). In addition,
levels of IGFBP-3, a negative regulator of IGF1, were markedly reduced in the TIS of all
investigated cell lines, favoring increased AKT pathway activation in the presence of IGF1
and stimulation of proliferation of resistant cells in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 7f–k).
To test the role of AKT activation as a mediator of TIS-induced tumour proliferation, we
combined vemurafenib with AKT/PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. In co-culture and proliferation
experiments using CM, dual inhibition of the MAPK and AKT pathway diminished the

growth benefit of the TIS (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). We then treated mice with A375/
A375R or A375R tumours with vemurafenib and AKT (MK2206) or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
(BEZ235). The combined inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
significantly blunted the outgrowth of vemurafenib-resistant cells in the A375/A375R
tumours (Fig. 4h). The growth inhibition was specific for the amplified proliferation in the
regressing tumour microenvironment and had no effects on the growth of resistant cells
alone (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Furthermore, the outgrowth of resistant A375R cells in
tumour seeding assays was significantly reduced when regressing tumours were co-treated
with BEZ235 (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Thus, the TIS induced proliferation is susceptible to
therapeutic targeting.

Author Manuscript

The limited effectiveness of targeted therapies has been attributed to intracellular feedback
loops and specific cytokines that support the survival of drug-sensitive cells. From these
residual tumours, clones emerge that are intrinsically resistant to targeted therapy and are
ultimately responsible for clinical relapse. Our work demonstrates that targeted inhibition of
a cancer driver pathway can paradoxically promote these two aspects of drug resistance via
induction of a complex, reactive secretome. This therapy-induced secretome (TIS) does not
only enhance the survival of drug-sensitive cells, but also acutely accelerates the expansion
and dissemination of drug-resistant clones. Rather than a cell death byproduct29,30, the TIS
is a live cell response to inhibition of an oncogenic driver pathway, mediated by a concrete
transcriptional program, and defined by specific alterations of intracellular signalling
networks (Fig. 4g).

Author Manuscript

Our identification of AKT signalling as a mediator of TIS-induced tumour progression in
BRAF-driven melanoma is in line with AKT activation in tumours observed in the clinic
during vemurafenib treatment16. Patients treated with BRAF inhibitor rarely show full
tumour regression3,4, and the remaining drug responsive tumour cells may remain a source
of TIS for the duration of the treatment. Our results provide a rationale for combining
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors with inhibitors of the MAPK pathway in the treatment
of these tumours. However, the breadth of the TIS and the generality of our findings across
different cell lineages, drugs (vemurafenib, crizotinib, and erlotinib), and resistance
mechanisms suggest that durable responses may require the combination of this type of
agents with a radically different therapeutic modality.

To generate vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines, vemurafenib-sensitive cell lines
were seeded at low density and exposed to 1–3μM vemurafenib (LC-Labs). After
approximately 8 weeks of continuous vemurafenib exposure we derived resistant cell clones
that were maintained on vemurafenib (1μM vemurafenib for M249R4, Colo800R, LOXR,
UACC62R; 2μM vemurafenib for A375R, YUMM 1.7R). The same protocol was performed
to generate a crizotinib resistant cell line from H3122 lung adenocarcinoma cells, which
were selected and maintained with 300nM crizotinib. Drug-sensitive and resistant melanoma
cell lines from A375, Colo800, UACC62 and YUMM 1.7 and the drug sensitive lung
adenocarcionoma cell lines H3122 and HCC827 were exposed to increasing doses of
vemurafenib and the number of cells was determined after 3 days and pERK levels after 1h
of vemurafenib, crizotinib or erlotinib exposure (Extended Data Fig 9a–j). Receptor status
was determined by Western blot and showed an increase in EGFR expression levels in all
resistant lines examined as well as an increase in MET receptor expression in A375R and
UACC62R cells compared to their parental, drug-sensitive cells (Extended Data Fig. 9k).
For co-culture assays sensitive cells were plated in 12-well or 24-well plates and allowed to
adhere over night in regular growth media. Media was then replaced with low serum (2%
FBS) media containing vehicle, 0.1μM vemurafenib, 0.3μM crizotinib, or 0.01μM erlotinib.
For control wells media containing vehicle or 0.1μM vemurafenib, 0.3μM crizotinib, or
0.01μM erlotinib was plated at the same time. After 48h TGL expressing, resistant cells
were plated on top of the vehicle/drug treated cells or in media-only control wells. Media
containing vehicle/drug was replenished every 48h. After 7 days luciferin [150μg/ml] was
added to the wells and luciferase-signal of resistant cells was determined by BLI using a
Xenogen Spectrum imaging machine (Perkin Elmer). Co-culture experiments were
independently performed at least two times and a representative experiment is shown.

To generate conditioned media (CM) 2.3×106 and 6.4×106 drug-sensitive cells were plated
on 15cm dishes in regular growth media and allowed to adhere over night. The media was
then replaced by low serum media containing vehicle or vemurafenib (0.1μM for A375 cells,
1μM for all other cell lines), on dishes containing 2.3×106 and 6.4×106 drug-sensitive cells,
respectively. The same procedure was followed for generation of conditioned media from
H3122 (crizotinib, 0.3 or 1μM), or HCC827 (erlotinib 0.01μM) lung adenocarcinoma cells.
After 72h cells on both plates had reached equal confluency of ~80% and CM was
harvested, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5min, filtered, and aliquots were stored at −80°C
until further use. Key proliferation and migration experiments yielded the same results when
performed with CM in which the same number of drug-sensitive cells (3.2×106) was plated
initially, which resulted in higher cell confluency in the vehicle-treated dish at time of CM
harvest.

performed at least two times. Representative experiments are shown.

XCelligence migration assay

Transwell migration assays were performed as described previously with minor
modifications31. Briefly, serum starved cells (0.2% FBS, over night) were labelled with cell
tracker green (Invitrogen, CA) for 30min at 37°C and allowed to recover for 1h. Cells
(25,000 – 50,000) were then seeded onto membrane inserts with 8μm pores and fluorescence
blocking filters (Falcon). The number of cells migrated through the pores of the membrane
was scored after 5–24h using an Evos microscope (AMG). Gap closing assay was performed
according to standard protocols. Briefly, cells were seeded and grown until confluent. A tip
was used to generate a gap, cells were washed and CM was added. Images were acquired
over time to monitor for cap closure in different conditions. All experiments were performed
independently at least two times. Representative experiments are shown.

Experiments were performed using the xCELLigence RTCA DP instrument (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) placed in a humidified incubator at 37°C with
5% CO2. Cell migration experiments were performed using modified 16-well plates
(CIM-16, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s

All experiments using animals were performed in accordance to our protocol approved by
MSKCC’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 5 – 7 week old, female
NOD-SCID NCR (NCI) or athymic NCR-NU-NU (NCI) mice were used for animal
experiments with human cell lines. Primary YUMM 1.1 and YUMM1.7 cell lines were
isolated from melanomas developed in mice (Tyr::CreER; BrafCA; Cdkn2a−/− Ptenlox/lox)
treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and were subsequently implanted in female C57BL/6J
(JAX) mice aged between 5–7 weeks. Tumour formation, outgrowth and metastasis were
monitored by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of TK-GFP-luciferase (TGL) labelled tumour
cells as described previously22. Briefly, anesthetized mice (Ketamine 150mg/kg Xylazine 15
mg/kg or isoflurane) were injected retro-orbitally with D-Luciferin (150mg/kg) and imaged
with IVIS Spectrum Xenogen machine (Caliper Life Sciences). Bioluminescence analysis
was performed using Living Image software, version 4.4. For co-implantation assays mice
were anesthetized (Ketamine 150mg/kg Xylazine 15 mg/kg) and 1×103 TGL-labelled
resistant tumour cells were injected subcutaneously with 2×106 sensitive tumour cells in
50μl growth factor reduced Matrigel/PBS (Corning) for the control groups in which the
effects of drug treatment on resistant cells alone were tested, 2×106 resistant cells were
injected in growth factor reduced Matrigel/PBS (1:1) (BD Biosciences). Two to four sites on
the flanks were injected per mouse. After tumours reached a size of 50–150mm3, the BLI
signal of resistant cells was determined. To compensate for minor growth differences of the

GFP+ resistant cell population between mice, the mice were assigned to the cohorts so that
the overall BLI intensity (and consequently the cell number) was equal in the treatment and
control group. Each group received vehicle or drug treatment as indicated (Vemurafenib/

quantified and normalized to BLI signal at start of treatment. Tumour seeding and metastasis
assays were performed as described with minor modifications20. Briefly, sensitive tumour
cells were injected subcutaneously on two sites per mouse. Once tumours were established
(50–150mm3) mice were treated with vehicle or vemurafenib (75mg/kg bid) for 3 days and
1×105 TGL-labelled drug-resistant cells were injected in the left cardiac ventricle. Treatment
was continued and metastatic burden and tumour seeding were determined in vivo and ex
vivo by BLI. Tumour volume was determined using caliper measurements and calculated
using the following formula: Tumour volume = (D*d2)/2. All experiments with A375 cells
were independently performed at least three times, except animal experiments in Fig. 3.
which were performed two times. All other animal experiments were independently

Cancer-cell-specific translational ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and sequencing

Author Manuscript

To investigate the gene expression changes specifically of drug-sensitive tumours during
vemurafenib treatment or gene expression changes of resistant cells exposed to a regressing
tumour microenvironment A375 and A375R cells, respectively, were modified to express
EGFP-RPL10a. Tumours derived from implanted A375-EGFP-RPL10a and A375R-EGFPRPL10a cells (were homogenized and processed with the TRAP protocol as previously
described28,32,33 with the following modifications: fresh tumour was homogenized with a
Model PRO 200 homogenizer at Speed 5 for 4 cycles of 15sec, RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor
(Promega, Cat No: N2615) was used as RNase inhibitor, and anti-GFP antibody coated
sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were used for immunoprecipitation. Polysome-associated
RNA was purified with RNAqeuous micro kit (Life Technologies, Cat No: AM1931).

Ribogreen and the Agilent BioAnalyzer technologies were used to quantify and control the
quality of RNA; 500ng RNA (RIN > 8.5) from each sample was used for library
construction with TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were barcoded and run on a Hiseq 2000 platform
in a 50bp/50bp or 75bp/75bp paired-end run, using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina). An
average of 40 million paired reads were generated per sample.
RNA-Seq analysis

Author Manuscript

For drug-sensitive A375, Colo800, UACC63, H3122 cells in vitro, raw paired-end
sequencing reads were mapped to human genome (Build hg19) with STAR2.3.0e34 using
standard options. Uniquely mapped reads were counted for each gene using HTSeq v0.5.435
with default settings. Read counts of each sample were normalized by library size using the
“DESeq”35 package of Bioconductor. Differential gene expression analysis between any two
conditions was performed based on a model utilizing the negative binomial distribution35.
Genes with FDR<0.05, fold change larger than 1.5 or smaller than 0.667 fold, and average
read counts larger than 10 were treated as differentially expressed genes. RNA-Seq data
from in vivo xenograft TRAP samples were processed with the following modifications to
avoid potential mRNA contamination from host mouse tissue: raw sequencing reads were
mapped to a hybrid genome consisting indexes of both human (Build hg19) and mouse
(Build mm9) genomes. Only reads that uniquely mapped to human genome indexes were
preserved and counted using HTSeq v0.5.435.
Bioinformatics analysis

Author Manuscript

Heatmap visualization of data matrices was performed using the “gplots” package of R.
Principle component analysis of RNA-Seq results was performed with the variance
stabilizing transformation methods in “DESeq” package of Bioconductor and the first two
principal components were plotted. Volcano plots were derived from “DESeq”-based
differential gene expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes with transcription factor
activity (GO:00037000) at 6h of vemurafenib treatment and gene products located in the
extracellular region (GO:00005576) at 48h of vemurafenib treatment were identified using
the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)36 v6.7
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) and enriched GO terms were visualized using REVIGO37
(http://revigo.irb.hr). Enriched transcriptional regulators for the list of differentially
expressed gene products in the extracellular region were predicted with DAVID v6.7 and
this list compared to the gene expression levels of transcription factors after 6h of
vemurafenib treatment in A375 cells. Upstream regulators, functions associated with the
gene expression profile and potential drug vulnerabilities were determined by IPA analysis
on differentially expressed genes from A375R –EGFP-RPL10a cells in different tumour
microenvironments in vivo.
Immunoblotting
RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) was used for cell lysis, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and the protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using Bis-Tris 4–12% gradient

Melanoma tissues were obtained from clinical trial patients or patients under standard
clinical management with approval of the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Patientinformed consent was obtained for the research performed in this study.
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Tissues for BrdU-immunofluorescence staining were obtained after overnight fixation with
PFA 4% at 4°C, embedded in OCT compound (VWR) and stored at −80°C. 10μm thick
cryosections on glass slides were used for immunofluorescence staining according to
standard protocols. Tissue for all other immunofluorescence from xenograft tumours was
obtained after fixation with PFA 4% at 4°C and a series of dehydration steps from 15% to
30% sucrose, as described previously38. Briefly, tumours were sliced using a sliding
microtome (Fisher). Tumour slices (80μm) were blocked floating in NGS 10%, BSA 2%,
Triton 0.25% in PBS for 2h at room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies were incubated
overnight at 4°C in the blocking solution and the following day for 30min at RT. After
washes in PBS-Triton 0.25%, secondary antibodies were added in the blocking solution and
incubated for 2h. After extensive washing in PBS-Triton 0.25%, nuclei were stained with
Bis-Benzamide for 5min at RT, tumour slices were washed and transferred to glass slides.
Slices were mounted with ProLong Gold anti fade reagent (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies:
GFP (GFP-1020, Aves Labs, 1:1000), Collagen IV (AP756, Millipore, 1:500), BrdU

Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Flow cytometry was performed as described previously22, with minor modifications.
Briefly, whole tumours were dissected, cut into smaller sections and dissociated for 1–3h
with 0.5% collagenase Type III (Worthington Biochemical) and 1% Dispase II (Roche) in
PBS. Resulting single cells suspensions were washed with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS
and filtered through a 70 μm nylon mesh. The resulting single cell suspension was incubated
for 10 min at 4°C with anti-mouse Fc-block CD16/32 antibody (2.4G2 BD) in PBS
supplemented with 1% BSA. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS/BSA and stained
with control antibodies or antibodies to detect immune cells diluted in PBS supplemented
with 0.5% BSA and 2mM EDTA. The following antibodies against mouse antigens were
used: CD45-PE-Cy7 (Clone 30-F11, BD Pharmingen, 1:200), CD11b-APC (Clone: M1/70,
BD Pharmingen, 1:100), Gr1-PE (MACS, 1:10), CD31-APC (Clone: 390, eBioscience,
1:100), F4/80-PE (Clone: BM8, eBioscience, 1:50). To determine the level of EdU
incorporation in A375R resistant cells within vehicle or vemurafenib treated A375/A375R
tumours EdU (50m/kg, Life Technologies) was injected i.p. After 2h tumours were
harvested, single cell suspensions generated as described above and further processed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Click-iT® Plus EdU Alexa Fluor® 647 Flow
Cytometry Assay Kit, Life technologies). Data was acquired using a FACS Calibur (BD
Biosciences). All experiments were performed independently at least two times.
Representative experiments are shown.

Cytokines and cytokine receptors of murine stromal and immune cells, in A375 tumours
treated with vehicle or vemurafenib for 5 days, were measured using the Mouse Cytokine
Array G2000 (RayBio, AAH-CYT-G2000-8, detecting 174 proteins), according to the
recommended protocols. Briefly, tumours were homogenized with a Mini Immersion
Blender (Pro Scientific) in Raybio Lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. Lysates were
centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000xg, the supernatant was harvested and protein concentration
was measured using the BCA Assay Kit (Pierce). 150μg protein was hybridized on the
antibody arrays overnight at 4°C. IRDye labeled streptavidin (LI-COR) at a dilution of
1:5,000 was used for the detection, slides were scanned using a Odyssey CLx scanner (LICOR) and analysed using Image Studio 2.0 software. The results were then normalized
using internal controls, and the relative protein levels determined across four biological
replicates.
Senescence β-galactosidase staining
A375 cells were grown in low-serum media and treated with vehicle or vemurafenib
(0.1μM) for 3 or 8 days, β-galactosidase staining was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signachaaling). All experiments were performed
independently three times. Representative experiments are shown.

Data are generally expressed as mean ± error of the mean (s.e.m.), or in box plots where the
centreline is median, whiskers are min. to max. Group sizes were determined based on the
results of preliminary experiments and no statistical method was used to predetermine
sample size. Group allocation and outcome assessment was not performed in a blinded
manner. All samples that met proper experimental conditions were included in the analysis.
Statistical significance was determined by using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test or
Student’s t-test using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software), or using a hypergeometric
variability test (http://www.geneprof.org). Significance was set at P < 0.05.
