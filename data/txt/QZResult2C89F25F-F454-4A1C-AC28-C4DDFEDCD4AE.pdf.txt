BACKGROUND: Patients with therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (t-APL) have been commonly exposed to
topoisomerase inhibitors and may potentially benefit from induction regimens omitting anthracyclines. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the outcomes of 29 patients with t-APL who were either treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO)
and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or with standard ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy was performed.
RESULTS: Prior therapy included chemotherapy alone, radiation alone, or a combination of the 2 in 19%, 33%, and 47% of
patients, respectively. The combination of ATO and ATRA (n ¼ 19) for induction resulted in a similar remission rate compared with ATRA plus chemotherapy (n ¼ 10) (89% vs 70%; P ¼ .35). The median overall survival for the patients treated
with ATRA plus ATO was not reached compared with that for patients treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy (161 weeks;
P ¼ .79). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of t-APL patients, outcomes with ATO and ATRA appeared to be comparable
to anthracycline-containing induction regimens. This combination may be preferable in t-APL patients to avoid any

KEYWORDS: therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia, arsenic trioxide, outcome, all-trans-retinoic acid.

Although the majority of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have de novo disease with no clear
underlying etiology, an increasing number of cases have been linked to prior exposure to chemotherapy, in particular to
topoisomerase II inhibitors.1,2 Recent work has demonstrated specific hot spots in the breakpoint region of the PML and
RARA genes, underscoring the causative role of topoisomerase II inhibitors in the etiology of these leukemias.3-5 In addition to topoisomerase II inhibitors, many other classes of cytotoxic agents (such as alkylating agents and nucleoside analogues), as well as radiotherapy alone, have been linked to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias in general6-13 and
therapy-related APL (t-APL) in particular.1 Many of these studies did not specify all the cytogenetic subtypes of the
patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias.
Treatment with regimens containing all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has revolutionized outcomes in APL.14 More
recently, arsenic trioxide (ATO), either alone or in combination with ATRA, was shown to be effective and less toxic than
chemotherapy as frontline therapy for APL.15-17 Previous reports have established outcomes of patients with t-APL,1,2,18
comparing them with de novo APL. However, to the best of our knowledge, none included patients who were treated
with ATO as a part of their initial therapy.
The objective of the current study was to characterize clinical parameters and treatment outcomes of 29 patients
with t-APL at the study institution, 19 of whom were treated with a frontline ATO-containing regimen.

identify patients with a diagnosis of APL (total n ¼ 301)
from 1980 through 2008. Among these, 35 patients carried a previous diagnosis of a malignancy other than APL,
1 patient had been treated previously for multiple sclerosis
(total t-APL; n ¼ 36). Seven patients, treated between
1980 and 1990, had not received ATRA and therefore
were excluded from our analysis. Therefore, a total of 29
patients with t-APL, treated between 1992 and 2008,
were included in our analysis. Clinical parameters, bone
marrow studies, and prior chemotherapy exposure were
retrieved by chart review (F.D.) and confirmed by another
coauthor (S.P.). Complete response (CR) was defined as
normalization of peripheral blood counts and bone marrow findings. Overall survival was measured as the time
from diagnosis of APL to the time of death or last followup.
Routine workup included bone marrow morphology, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization for
t(15;17), and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for both short and long forms of the
PML-RARA fusion transcript. Two patients with normal
cytogenetics were diagnosed based on bone marrow morphology and RT-PCR.
The chi-square test was used to describe differences
of clinical values among groups. Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.

RESULTS
Patients
Twenty-nine patients who had received prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy developed t-APL between 1992
and 2008. Table 1 shows the patient characteristics. The
median age of the patients was 54 years (range, 35-81
years) and 14 (48%) were female. The median white
blood cell count (WBC) at the time of presentation was
1.6  1000/lL (range, 0.6-162.5 1000/lL). As a comparison, the median age at presentation in 265 patients
with de novo APL treated at our institution in the same
time interval was 42 years (range, 13-80 years; P <.001),
and 49% were female (P value was not significant) with a
median WBC of 3.5 1000/lL (range, 0.2-195  1000/
lL; P value not significant.).
Prior Malignancies
The most common primary cancer was breast cancer (9 of
29 patients), followed by prostate cancer (5 of 29
patients), and lymphoma (4 of 29 patients). Six patients
had been previously treated with chemotherapy only, 10
with radiotherapy only, and 13 had received both treat-

ment modalities. Thirteen of 29 patients had prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors (10 patients with
anthracyclines, 1 with etoposide, and 3 with mitoxantrone; 2 patients had received 2 different topoisomerase II
inhibitors). The exact prior chemotherapy was not documented for 1 patient with breast cancer.
The median interval from primary disorder to the
diagnosis of t-APL was 3.5 years (range, 1-19 years). The
incidence of t-APL has increased with advancing decades
(9% of all patients with APL diagnosed between 1992 and
1999 vs 16% of patients diagnosed between 2000 and
2008; P ¼ .07). This trend confirms previous reports,1,19
possibly explained by the more widespread use of topoisomerase II inhibitors, mainly for the treatment of breast
cancer.
Molecular Studies
Cytogenetics data were available for 28 of 29 patients
(Table 1). Cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to
t(15;17) occurred in 13 of 29 patients (45%) and most
frequently involved chromosome 8 (4 of 29 patients;
14%). The presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities was not associated with a worse outcome. Among 25
patients with available RT-PCR data, detection of the
short PML-RARA isoform (14 of 25 patients; 56%) was
associated with a trend toward shorter survival compared
with the long isoform (11 of 25 patients; 44%) (161
weeks vs 344 weeks; P ¼ .29).
Prognostic Factors
A WBC >10,000/lL was associated with fewer CRs and
worse survival. The CR rate in 10 patients with a WBC
>10,000/lL was 60% (6 of 10 patients), with a median
survival of 5 weeks (range, 0-282 weeks) versus 95% (18
of 19 patients) and a median survival of 117 weeks (range,
4-650 weeks) for 19 patients with a WBC <10,000/lL.
Four of 10 patients with a WBC >10,000/lL failed to
achieve a CR, and all had died within 2 weeks of the initiation of induction therapy for t-APL.
Response to Therapy and Survival
The detailed doses and schedules for the drugs used for tAPL induction regimens are shown in Table 2. Postremission therapy was varied depending on the regimen, and
the details have been published previously.16,20,21 The
combination of ATO and ATRA (n ¼ 19) for induction
resulted in a CR rate comparable to that of ATRA plus
chemotherapy (n ¼ 10) (89% vs 70%; P ¼ .35). The median overall survival for the patients treated with ATRA

plus ATO was not reached compared with that for
patients treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy (161
weeks; P ¼ .79) (Fig. 1). The difference in the median survival was not significantly different between the 2 groups
and likely was a result of a shorter follow-up interval in
the ATRA plus ATO group. The median follow-up for all
patients (both alive and dead) in the ATRA plus chemotherapy cohort was 51 months (range, 1-117 months),
whereas the median follow-up time for all patients in the
ATRA plus ATO cohort was 18 months (range, 1-65
months). The median ages for patients treated with
ATRA plus ATO and ATRA plus chemotherapy were 53
years and 56.5 years, respectively (P value not significant).
The percentage of patients with a presenting WBC
>10,000/lL was 37% (7 of 19 patients) in patients
treated with ATRA plus ATO versus 30% (3 of 10
patients) in patients treated with ATRA plus
chemotherapy.
At the time of last analysis (December 2009), 7 of
19 patients in the ATRA plus ATO group and 7 of 10
patients in the ATRA plus chemotherapy group had died.
The cause of death was due to leukemia in 4 of 7 patients
in the ATRA plus ATO group and 5 of 7 patients in the
ATRA plus chemotherapy group. There was no difference
in early mortality noted between the 2 cohorts, because in
each group, 2 patients died within 4 weeks of the initiation of induction therapy for t-APL.
We also compared the outcome of the patients with
t-APL with a cohort of patients with de novo APL who
were treated at our institution during the same time inter-

val. As expected, the de novo APL cohort had a significantly younger age at the time of diagnosis (median age,
42 years; range, 13-80 years [P < .0001 vs t-APL]). Otherwise, clinical parameters and outcomes were similar to
t-APL patients: the median presenting WBC was 3500/
lL (range, 200-195,000 lL [P ¼ .106 vs t-APL]) and the
3-year survival rate was 65% (P ¼ .175 vs t-APL). In the
de novo APL cohort, 80 of 85 patients (94%) who were
treated with ATRA plus ATO (P ¼ .099 vs t-APL) and 26
of 110 patients (76%) treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy achieved a CR.

DISCUSSION
The long-term effects of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy include myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and
cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, it is plausible that frontline treatment of patients with t-APL previously exposed
to anthracyclines, with regimens that omit chemotherapy,
particularly topoisomerase II inhibitors, might be beneficial. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining
the outcome of patients with t-APL who were treated with
ATRA and ATO. In our experience, ATO and ATRA
appear to produce results comparable to anthracyclinecontaining regimens. Although not statistically significant
due to the relatively small number of patients, the combination of ATO plus ATRA was found to be associated

113

Original Article

with a similar response rate and overall survival compared
with ATRA plus chemotherapy. In addition to the risk of
MDS and cardiotoxicity, there are patient-related reasons
why such a regimen would be desirable in patients with
t-APL. Pulsoni et al reported a significantly higher proportion of t-APL patients with poor performance status
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score >2) when
compared with de novo APL patients.19 Furthermore,
their higher median age makes these patients more susceptible to chemotherapy-induced adverse events and organ
toxicities. The higher median age as well as worse performance status in t-APL patients compared with de novo
APL patients might have contributed to the inferior outcomes in our cohort of t-APL patients compared with de
novo APL patients treated during the same time interval.
In addition, consistent with the referral pattern to a major
cancer center, it is possible that there was a bias toward
poorer prognosis patients treated at our center compared
with patients treated at other centers.
There are several limitations to the current study.
The small number of patients diagnosed with t-APL during the time span included in the study, the lack of randomization, and the retrospective nature of the analysis
make the results susceptible to uncontrolled biases that
might influence the validity of our conclusions. However,
the most important prognostic factor (WBC >10,000/
lL) remained valid. It would be ideal to determine the
exact causes of death of the patients on study. However,
the majority of patients died outside of our institution
with no detailed record of the cause of death available,
making it difficult to determine the influence of the toxicities of the 2 strategies on the long-term outcome. Finally,
supportive care has improved over the past 3 decades, possibly accounting for differences in survival among our
patients. Nevertheless, a higher percentage of patients
treated with ATRA and ATO achieved a CR, an endpoint
that should not be as significantly influenced by
supportive care.
In summary, the current study presents our singleinstitution experience of what to the best of our knowledge is the largest series of patients with t-APL treated
with a frontline regimen with no chemotherapy reported
to date. Although we cannot draw definitive conclusions
because of the limited sample size, the combination of
ATO plus ATRA appears not to be inferior and therefore
might be preferable in patients with t-APL to reduce the
possible risk of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy or
MDS. Although ideally, given the low incidence of
t-APL, prospective randomized trials are required to con-

114

firm our observation, it will be a difficult task to accrue
enough patients for such a trial. Thus, although lacking
controlled randomized trials data, we might need to resort
to observational studies such as this one, despite its limitations, to gain insight into possible treatment options for
patients with t-APL.
