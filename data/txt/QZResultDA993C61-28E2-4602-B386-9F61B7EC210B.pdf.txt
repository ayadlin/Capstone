Abstract
Natural killer (NK) immune cells mediate antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by aggregating FcgRIIIA/CD16, contributing signiﬁcantly to the therapeutic effect of CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In this study, we show that CD16 ligation on
primary human NK cells by the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab or
ofatumumab stably impairs the spontaneous cytotoxic response
attributable to cross-tolerance of several unrelated NK-activating
receptors (including NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp46, and 2B4). Similar
effects were obtained from NK cells isolated from patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia in an autologous setting. NK cells
rendered hyporesponsive in this manner were deﬁcient in the
ability of these cross-tolerized receptors to phosphorylate effector

signaling molecules critical for NK cytotoxicity, including SLP-76,
PLCg2, and Vav1. These effects were associated with long-lasting
recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the CD16
receptor complex. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of SHP-1
with sodium stibogluconate counteracted CD20 mAb-induced NK
hyporesponsiveness, unveiling an unrecognized role for CD16 as a
bifunctional receptor capable of engendering long-lasting NK
cell inhibitory signals. Our work deﬁnes a novel mechanism of
immune exhaustion induced by CD20 mAb in human NK cells,
with potentially negative implications in CD20 mAb-treated
patients where NK cells are partly responsible for clinical efﬁcacy.

Introduction

the immunotherapeutic efﬁcacy and to high relapse rate, is a
major problem in patients with B-cell lymphomas (6). One
possible mechanism thought to contribute to a reduced therapeutic efﬁcacy is the decreased ability to execute ADCC, mainly
attributed to CD16 downregulation upon recognition of antiCD20–coated targets (7–11).
NK cell–mediated ADCC is based on the recognition of IgGopsonized targets by the low-afﬁnity receptor for IgG, FcgRIIIA/
CD16 (12). In human NK cells, CD16 has 2 extracellular Ig
domains, a short cytoplasmic tail, and a transmembrane domain
that enables its association with immune receptor tyrosine-based
activation motif (ITAM)-containing TCR-z and FceRI-g chains
(13). Besides CD16, the prototype of NK-activating receptors,
NK cells express a variety of activating receptors cooperating in
driving the natural cytotoxic response (14). Indeed, several activating receptors, including the lectin-like receptor NKG2D, the
signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family member, 2B4, the Ig-like receptor DNAM-1 and the natural cytotoxicity
receptor (NCR), NKp46, recognize a multitude of ligands
expressed on infected and tumor cells, playing an important role
in antitumor response and immunosurveillance (15).
In the last few years, numerous evidences have revealed that the
reactivity of NK cells is very plastic and support the idea that mature
NK cells undergo continuous re-education (also called licensing or
tuning). With a mechanism that complements education via
inhibitory receptors, the sustained engagement of selected activating receptors, including NKG2D, NKp46, and KIR2DS1, has been
shown to downregulate NK cell responsiveness (16–19).
Here we have addressed whether engagement of CD16 by
exposure to anti-CD20 mAbs may lead to NK cell exhaustion.
We show that CD16 ligation on primary human NK cells by
rituximab- or ofatumumab-opsonized targets results in a
marked and persistent impairment of the spontaneous

Anti-CD20–based therapies represent a breakthrough in the
treatment of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. The
chimeric rituximab is considered the reference molecule for the
comparison of new-generation anti-CD20 mAbs designed to
reach enhanced clinical activity; among them, the fully human
ofatumumab, currently approved for relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), binds to a CD20 epitope different
from the rituximab-binding site (1, 2). Both rituximab and
ofatumumab belong to class I mAbs on the basis of their capability to redistribute CD20 molecules into lipid rafts (2).
Class I mAbs may act through multiple mechanisms, including
the activation of complement-dependent cytotoxicity and the
recruitment of FcgRþ effector cells for antibody-dependent phagocytosis and natural killer (NK) cell–mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC; refs. 1, 3–5).
Despite widespread treatment successes, the development of
resistance to anti-CD20 mAbs, leading to a substantial decrease in

cytotoxic response due to the cross-tolerance of several unrelated NK-activating receptors, without affecting the ability to
secrete IFNg. Importantly, analogous observations were
obtained in NK cells from patients with CLL in an autologous
setting. We also provide evidences that in hyporesponsive NK
cells, stimulation of the cross-inhibited receptors resulted in the
defective tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling elements critical for NK cytotoxicity such as SLP-76, PLCg2, and Vav1, likely
imputable to the long-lasting recruitment of SHP-1 to CD16
receptor complex.

Materials and Methods
Patients and healthy donors
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained
from healthy donors of Transfusion Center of Sapienza University (Rome, Italy) or from patients with CLL of Hematology Unit,
S. Maria Goretti Hospital (Latina, Italy). The study was conducted according to protocols approved by our local institutional review board and in accordance with Declaration of
Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients. The diagnosis of CLL was based on criteria recommended by the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia; the stage of disease was assessed according to the
Rai staging system (20). In all specimens, the percentage of
CD5þCD19þ CLL cells was more than 80%. From each patient, a
part of PBMC was used to obtain primary cultured NK cells (see
below) and a portion was cryopreserved and stored at 160 C.
The day before the experiment, samples were thawed, cultured
overnight in complete medium, and then checked for cell
viability by trypan blue staining. Only samples with viability
more than 90% were used.

Cell systems
Primary cultured human NK cells were obtained from healthy
donors or from CLL patients as previously described (21). The
experiments were performed on NK cells (CD3CD56þ) more
than 80% pure. When speciﬁed, NK cells were pretreated for 48
hours with recombinant human IL2 (200 U/mL; R&D Systems).
The following cell lines were used: the human CD20þ lymphoblastoid, Raji, provided by Dr. F.D. Batista (Cancer Research UK,
London, UK); the thymic lymphocytic leukemia, HPB-ALL,
obtained from Dr. G. Scala (University "Magna Graecia" of
Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy; ref. 22); the murine thymoma,
BW5147, obtained form A. Moretta (University of Genoa, Genoa,
Italy; ref. 23); human lymphoblastoid Daudi and 721.221, T-cell
leukemia MOLT-4, erythroleukemia K562, and colon carcinoma
CaCo2 were all obtained from ATCC. NK-resistant targets murine
pro-B-cell line Ba/F3 and Ba/F3-MICA (stably expressing
MICA 0019) cells were provided by Dr. L.L. Lanier (University
of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; ref. 24); Ba/F3-PVR, Ba/F3CD48 transfectants were kindly provided by Dr. A. Soriani and Dr.
A. Zingoni (Sapienza University). Cells were authenticated (last
testing January–May 2014) by morphology, growth, and immunophenotypic characteristics, biologic behavior according to the
provider recommendations, and tested for mycoplasma contamination by EZ-PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit (Biological Industries).
All cell lines were and kept in culture for less than two consecutive
months.
Anti-CD20–mediated NK cell stimulation
Raji cells or primary CLL were loaded with 10 mg/mL of EZ-Link
Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 30 minutes at
room temperature. Cells were then opsonized with rituximab

different times, where indicated. NK cells were then recovered by
negative selection on streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen,
Life Technologies). When speciﬁed, immunomagnetically isolated NK populations were replated in culture medium, supplemented or not with IL2 (200 U/mL).
Evaluation of cytotoxic activity and IFNg release
To analyze cytotoxic activity, rituximab- or ofatumumb-experienced NK populations were assessed in a 4-hour 51Cr release
assay. IFNg was analyzed by commercial ELISA kit (Thermo
Scientiﬁc; for details, see Supplementary Data).
Statistical and densitometric analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance between two groups was determined by
2-tailed, paired Student t test. Differences among multiple groups
were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using Prism 5 software
(GraphPad). Where indicated, values were expressed as mean
 SEM and differences were considered to be statistically significant when P < 0.05. Quantiﬁcation of speciﬁc bands (pixel
intensity) was performed with ImageJ1.41o software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD).

Results
NK cell interaction with anti-CD20–opsonized targets induces
CD16 internalization
To compare the kinetics of CD16 downmodulation induced by
two class I anti-CD20 mAbs, we evaluated CD16 levels in primary
human NK cells upon interaction with rituximab- or ofatumumab-opsonized CD20þ targets. Hereafter, in all experiments, we
used NK cells stimulated with not opsonized target as control
population. Our data (Fig. 1A and B) show a progressive CD16
downmodulation that was superimposable in NK cells interacting
with rituximab- or ofatumumab-opsonized targets. CD16 expression reached minimum levels (40% of control) in 2 hours of
interaction, keeping a plateau of downmodulation until 18-hour
stimulation (Fig. 1B).
Because both internalization and/or receptor shedding may
contribute to anti-CD20–induced CD16 reduction (25), we
evaluated CD16 dynamics by ﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig.
1C). As compared with the ring pattern of unconjugated cells,
CD16 distributed in intracellular dots in NK cells interacting
with rituximab- or ofatumumab-opsonized targets, thus indicating an internalization process. No evidence of anti-CD20
internalization was observed; instead, it appeared capped at cell
membrane, as reported by others (26), in some extent colocalizing with residual surface CD16. Furthermore, by comparing
CD16 levels in ﬁxed and ﬁxed/permeabilized NK cells, we
observed that almost 50% of downmodulated CD16 was the
result of internalization occurring during opsonized target
interaction (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These data demonstrate that the interaction with rituximab- or
ofatumumab-opsonized targets similarly induces surface CD16
downmodulation, which is partially attributable to receptor
internalization.

NK cell interaction with anti-CD20–opsonized targets results in
a marked defect of cytotoxic responses
We investigated the impact of the NK cell interaction with
opsonized targets on their cytolytic potential. Hereafter, "experienced NK cells" deﬁne primary cultured NK cells immunomagnetically isolated upon 90 minutes of coculture with rituximab- or ofatumumab-opsonized targets. Cytotoxic activity
of anti-CD20 experienced NK cells was assayed against rituximab-opsonized or -sensitive targets to test ADCC or spontaneous cytotoxicity, respectively. As expected, experienced NK
cells exhibit a reduced ability to execute ADCC (Fig. 2A), but,
more interestingly, we observed a marked impairment of
the cytotoxic activity toward a panel of sensitive targets, that
was comparable in rituximab- or ofatumumab-experienced
NK cells (Fig. 2A).
Because in our experiments the impact of rituximab or ofatumumab on NK cell responsiveness was largely superimposable,
we focused our analysis on rituximab.
The analysis of the kinetics of anti-CD20–dependent hyporesponsiveness revealed that it was already evident after 30 minutes and reached a plateau between 90 and 180 minutes of
interaction with opsonized targets (Fig. 2B). We then addressed
the persistence of the hyporesponsiveness by testing the cytotoxic
activity of NK cells maintained in culture for different lengths
of time upon opsonized target detachment. Albeit a partial
rescue was observed, a clear reduction of the spontaneous
cytotoxicity persisted until 48 hours. Notably, when the same
effector population was preactivated and cultured in the presence of IL2, a progressive recovery of the cytolytic function that
paralleled CD16 re-expression was evident, being almost complete after 48 hours (Fig. 2C).
These experiments demonstrate that CD16 downregulation
induced by rituximab- or ofatumumab-opsonized target interaction is associated with a persistent defect of the cytotoxic
responses.
NK hyporesponsiveness involves the cross-tolerance of
different activating receptor systems
With the aim to investigate, at individual receptor level, whether anti-CD20–induced NK cell hyporesponsiveness could regard
selected activating receptors, we tested the ability of rituximabexperienced NK cells to kill resistant targets (Supplementary
Fig. S2A) bearing individual receptor ligand, that is, MHCI-related
chain A (MIC-A), poliovirus receptor (PVR), or CD48, to explore
NKG2D-, DNAM-1-, or 2B4-dependent lysis, respectively; moreover, we took advantage of BW5147 thymoma cell line whose
killing is mostly due to NKp46 triggering (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). Our ﬁndings show a signiﬁcant defect of the cytotoxic
activity triggered by the different receptors analyzed demonstrating that rituximab-mediated CD16 aggregation cross-inhibits
multiple and unrelated activating receptor families (Fig. 2D,
Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To assess whether the defect of spontaneous cytotoxicity could
be related to the downmodulation of activating receptors
occurring during target interaction, we analyzed the expression
levels of a panel of activating and adhesion receptors. Unlike
CD16 expression, we did not observe signiﬁcant differences in
rituximab-experienced NK cells with respect to control population or to the NK cells that did not interact with target
cells (unstimulated; Fig. 2E). When we evaluated perforin
and granzyme B, we observed that cytolytic mediator levels in

Anti-CD20–Induced CD16-Dependent NK Exhaustion

rituximab-experienced NK cells was similar to that of control
populations, leading us to exclude that the cytotoxic defect
depends on the depletion of lytic mediators (Fig. 2F). Analogously, the same rituximab-induced hyporesponsive phenotype was
also observed in the absence of IL2 stimulation (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
Rituximab-opsonized primary B-CLL cells tune-down CD16
expression and cytolytic potential in autologous NK cells
To extend our observations to NK cells of patients potentially
candidate to rituximab treatment, we analyzed 6 untreated
patients with CLL (Supplementary Table S1). Primary CLL cells
were opsonized with rituximab and allowed to interact with
autologous primary NK cells. Rituximab-experienced NK cells
were tested for CD16 expression and for spontaneous cytotoxicity.
Our ﬁndings show that NK cell interaction with autologousopsonized leukemia cells induces a marked downmodulation of
CD16 receptor (Fig. 3A) that is associated with a relevant defect of
spontaneous cytotoxic activity against Raji cells and PVR-expressing target cells (Fig. 3B and C).
Lytic granule secretion but not IFNg production is impaired in
rituximab-experienced NK cells
We sought to investigate whether the defective cytotoxic
activity could selectively involve different steps of the lytic
event (27, 28). Our data show that neither the ability to
form conjugates with targets nor the polarization of lytic
granules at cytolytic synapse (Fig. 4A and B) resulted impaired.
However, when we measured the ability to secrete lytic granules
in response to target stimulation by assessing CD107a surface
levels, we observed a signiﬁcant defect of lytic granule exocytosis in rituximab-experienced NK cells with respect to unstimulated cells. Such impairment was observed in both CD16þ
and CD16 downregulated populations (Supplementary
Fig. S4). In line with our evidences of a normal lytic granule
content in hyporesponsive cells, degranulation induced by
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin
resulted unaffected (Fig. 4C).
We then explored the ability of rituximab-experienced NK cells
to secrete IFNg. We observed that NK cell stimulation with target
cells, with mAbs speciﬁc for the cross-inhibited receptors or with

IL2, induced a comparable amount of IFNg with respect to control
populations (Fig. 4D).
These data demonstrate that the hyporesponsive status involves
a selective defect of lytic granule exocytosis but not the ability to
produce IFNg.
Defect of SLP-76, PLCg2, and Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation in
rituximab-experienced NK cells
Assuming that CD16 downregulation may subtract dose-limiting signaling elements (29), we analyzed the phosphorylation
events downstream to the cross-inhibited receptors. On the basis
of our observation of a defective lytic granule exocytosis, we
focused our analysis on signaling pathways controlling granule
secretion at the cytolytic synapse. Our data demonstrate a marked
defect on tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 at Y128 residue,
induced by CD16 itself or by NKp46, NKG2D, or DNAM-1
stimulation in rituximab-experienced NK cells. Concomitantly,
we also observed reduced levels of PLCg2 tyrosine phosphorylation at Y1217 residue. Similarly, receptor-induced Vav1 tyrosine
phosphorylation at Y160 residue was also reduced, although
some basal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were evident in
rituximab-experienced cells (Fig. 5A and B). Conversely, in hyporesponsive cells, Akt and Erk phosphorylation downstream
cross-inhibited receptors resulted unaffected (Fig. 5C).
These results demonstrate that in rituximab-experienced NK
cells tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, PLCg2, and Vav1,
downstream to activating receptors is impaired.
Recruitment of SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase to CD16 receptor
complex upon rituximab stimulation
The defective tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, PLCg2, and
Vav1 led us to hypothesize the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase coupled to CD16. We sought to analyze whether CD16
would be coupled to SHP-1/2 upon rituximab stimulation.
Immunoblot analysis of CD16z chain immunoprecipitates
revealed that rituximab stimulation induces a delayed and
long-lasting association of SHP-1 to phosphorylated CD16z
chain reaching maximal levels after 60 minutes of stimulation.
Notably, the ability of z chain to recruit SHP-1 was inversely
proportional to its tyrosine phosphorylation levels: indeed, SHP1 was not detectable at 5-minute stimulation, when z chain

was maximally phosphorylated, but appeared upon 30 minutes, further increasing at 60 minutes of rituximab stimulation
(Fig. 6A). In contrast, we did not observe any evidences of SHP2 recruitment. Intriguingly, the aggregation of CD16 obtained
with anti-CD16 (B73.1) mAb did not induce a detectable SHP-1
recruitment. Of note, in such aggregation conditions, although
a very efﬁcient CD16 downmodulation occurred (Fig. 6B), NK
cells preserved their cytolytic potential (Fig. 6C).
These experiments show that rituximab-mediated but not antiCD16 mAb-mediated stimulation induces the recruitment of
SHP-1 to CD16 receptor complex.
Pharmacologic inhibition of SHP-1 activity counteracts
rituximab-induced NK hyporesponsiveness
The hypothesis that SHP-1 phosphatase activity may be
responsible for the functional impairment was tested by inhibiting SHP-1 with SSG, which has been shown to be the most
sensitive tyrosine phosphatase (30, 31). Because SHP-1 activity
classically mediates the inhibitory signals downstream MHCI
inhibitory NK receptors in co-aggregation conditions (32), we
avoided that their engagement would occur during target recognition by using MHCI-negative Daudi cell line. Our data
show that in SSG-pretreated NK cells, the defect of spontaneous
cytotoxicity in rituximab-experienced NK cells was partially but
signiﬁcantly prevented. This effect was observed at variable
degree in all donors tested (Fig. 6D), indicating that SHP-1

4102 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

acts in limiting the cytotoxic responses in rituximab-experienced NK cells.

Discussion
The central observation of our report is that preligation of
CD16 by anti-CD20 mAbs reduces the ability of NK cells to kill
target cells; indeed, we demonstrate that the outcome of NK cell
interaction with rituximab- or ofatumumab-opsonized targets is a
comprehensive reduction of both Ab-dependent and -independent cytotoxic potential. Such NK hyporesponsive status is almost
fully established upon 30 minutes of CD16 ligation and persists at
least until 48 hours of stimulation. Our data highlight that the
hyporesponsiveness does not involve the ability to secrete IFNg in
response to the cross-inhibited receptors. This observation is not
really surprising, taking into account the uncoupling of the
signaling pathways and molecular machinery leading to the
activation of the cytolytic program or to the production of
cytokines, including IFNg (33).
The impairment of ADCC response can easily be explained by
CD16 downmodulation induced by the stimulation of NK cells
with anti-CD20–opsonized targets, which is only partially attributable to receptor internalization; such ﬁnding complements
recent observations demonstrating that rituximab stimulation,
through activation of metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17), promotes
CD16 shedding (25).

Less expected is the ﬁnding that anti-CD20–mediated CD16
stimulation also promotes a marked reduction of the ability of NK
cells to kill sensitive targets attributable to the cross-inhibition of
multiple unrelated activating receptors, including NKG2D, 2B4,
NKp46, and DNAM-1, which are coupled to both ITAM- and non–
ITAM-containing signaling adaptors (14, 15). The observation
that preligation of CD16 induces NK cell hyporesponsiveness is
strengthened by the ﬁnding that the exposure of primary NK cells
from patients with CLL to rituximab-opsonized autologous leukemia cells induces a signiﬁcant reduction of natural killing
potential. Importantly, our observations might account for the
marked defect of spontaneous cytotoxicity in ex vivo isolated NK
cells from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated
with rituximab (34). Furthermore, the cooperation of activating
receptors, stimulated by novel therapeutic mAbs or by tumor
ligands, in determining the overall response to tumor targeting
mAbs have been recently highlighted (35–37); their cross-toler-

ance induced by rituximab treatment may negatively affect the
clinical outcome.
We also provide evidences that the cytotoxic defect is not
attributable to an altered phenotype or to depletion of cytolytic mediators: indeed, the levels of activating and adhesion
receptors as well as of perforin and granzyme B are largely
unaffected.
We were much intrigued in understanding the molecular basis of
NK hyporesponsiveness induced by CD16 preligation. In natural
killing, a mechanistic role of CD16 has been deﬁned through the
demonstration that CD16-dependent proximal signaling elements
may be exploited by other activating receptors (29). We explored
the possibility that the persistent engagement of CD16 may lead to
the inhibition of critical molecules acting in signal integration
downstream to activating receptors. On this regard, the adaptor
protein SLP-76 has been shown to orchestrate the formation of a
molecular platform allowing the tyrosine phosphorylation of

critical signaling elements such Vav1 and PLCg2 (14, 38). Our
data show in hyporesponsive NK cells a marked defect in SLP76, PLCg2, and Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by
the stimulation of cross-inhibited receptors or by CD16
itself. Furthermore, we observed that the activation of PI3K
and MAPK-dependent signals resulted unaffected. These
data, in the context of our observation of a selective defect of

lytic granule exocytosis with normal granule polarization in
rituximab-experienced NK cells, recapitulate the dichotomy of
molecular signals governing polarization versus degranulation:
the pathway sequentially involving PI3K/Rac1/Pak1/MEK/
ERK1/2 has been referred as pivotal for granule polarization,
whereas PLCg/calcium-dependent signals are the hallmark for
their secretion (27, 28, 39).

We ﬁrstly provide evidences of the involvement of SHP-1
in CD16-dependent cross-tolerance of activating receptors.
Indeed, we observe that rituximab stimulation promotes
the recruitment of SHP-1 phosphatase, but not SHP-2, to
the tyrosine phosphorylated CD16 z chain. This recruitment
was delayed (30 minutes) and long-lasting (1 hour) with a

time course drastically different from the classical rapid
recruitment of SHP-1 by ITIM-containing MHCI inhibitory
receptors in condition of co-aggregation with activating
receptors (32).
We propose that the recruitment of SHP-1 to targeted CD16
promotes its accumulation at the plasma membrane, reaching a

threshold level that would allow the dephosphorylation of signaling proteins, thus desensitizing activating receptors subsequently
stimulated (Figure 7). Indeed, both SLP-76 and Vav1 have been
shown to be key targets of SHP-1 triggered by killer inhibitory
receptors in NK cells (40, 41). We are currently investigating by
imaging approaches the spatial coordination of inhibitory signals;
on this purpose, a recent report demonstrated a raft-dependent cosegregation of SHP-1 with signaling effectors into intracellular
clusters (called inhibisomes), providing an appropriate scaffold
for substrates interaction during inhibitory process (42). A functional role of SHP-1 in mediating CD16-dependent hyporesponsiveness is indicated by our observation that SHP-1 pharmacologic
inhibition with SSG, known to inhibit SHP-1 (30), signiﬁcantly
interferes with rituximab-induced inhibitory responses.
On the basis of our data showing a long-lasting NK exhaustion following rituximab stimulation, we cannot exclude that a
transcriptional or a posttranscriptional modulation may contribute to NK hyporesponsiveness. Accordingly, the recovery of
NK responsiveness driven by IL2 treatment, strictly associated
to the restoration of CD16 levels, may indicate a de novo gene
expression and protein synthesis. Indeed, recent data demonstrated that the calibration of NK cell reactivity is subjected to a
genetic-based tuning attributable to transcription factor modulation (19, 43).

4106 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

Strikingly and in contrast with rituximab, receptor ligation
by anti-CD16 mAb was ineffective in promoting SHP-1 recruitment. Notably, in the same stimulation conditions, the ability
of NK cells to kill sensitive targets was preserved, indicating
a relationship between aggregation conditions and the ability
to promote inhibitory signal toward heterologous receptors.
It would be interesting to address whether other therapeutic
mAbs, acting through the triggering of ADCC, such as trastuzumab and cetuximab or with improved afﬁnity for CD16,
as obinutuzumab, may also mediate a CD16-dependent inhibitory signal.
Overall our ﬁndings are in line with the emerging paradigm
considering that the targeting of some classically activating Fc
receptors in myeloid cells with low-avidity ligands, paradoxically
transmit inhibitory signals, through the recruitment of SHP-1,
leading to the inhibition of a number of innate immune responses
(44–46).
We identify here a mechanism of exhaustion of NK cells likely
contributing to the resistance and/or to the development of a
refractory status to rituximab-containing regimens leading to
disease relapse or progression (6). Furthermore, our data may
provide insights on the high frequency of viral reactivation in
rituximab-treated patients, which may implicate an NK hyporesponsiveness leading to reduced immunosurveillance (47).
