ABSTRACT:
The capacity of breast cancer cells to form mammospheres in non-adherent
serum-free culture is used as a functional characteristic of the self-renewing stemlike cell population. The present studies demonstrate that silencing expression of
the MUC1-C oncoprotein inhibits growth of luminal MCF-7 and HER2-overexpressing
SKBR3 breast cancer cells as mammospheres. We also show that triple-negative MDAMB-468 breast cancer cells are dependent on MUC1-C for growth as mammospheres
and tumor xenografts. Similar results were obtained when MUC1-C function was
inhibited by expression of a MUC1-C(CQCAQA) mutant. Moreover, treatment with
the MUC1-C inhibitor GO-203, a cell penetrating peptide that binds to the MUC1-C
cytoplasmic domain and blocks MUC1-C function, confirmed the importance of this
target for self-renewal. The mechanistic basis for these findings is supported by the
demonstration that MUC1-C activates NF-κB, occupies the IL-8 promoter with NF-κB,
and induces IL-8 transcription. MUC1-C also induces NF-κB-dependent expression of
the IL-8 receptor, CXCR1. In concert with these results, targeting MUC1-C with GO203 suppresses IL-8/CXCR1 expression and disrupts the formation of established
mammospheres. Our findings indicate that MUC1-C contributes to the self-renewal of
breast cancer cells by activating the NF-κBIL-8/CXCR1 pathway and that targeting
MUC1-C represents a potential approach for the treatment of this population.

INTRODUCTION

stem-like cells in solid tumors [5]. In addition, aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity has been a focus of
study as a marker for both normal and cancer stem cells
[6]. Indeed, many of these markers are not exclusively
expressed by cancer stem-like cells and the available
evidence indicates that there is considerable phenotypic
heterogeneity within these populations [4, 5]. With
regard to functional characteristics, a hallmark of cancer
stem-like cells is their relative resistance to apoptosis in
the response to genotoxic stress induced by anti-cancer
drugs and radiation [7]. Moreover, cancer stem-like cells
have been characterized by their ability to undergo the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that
endows more differentiated epithelial cells with stem
cell characteristics [8]. The induction of EMT results

Normal tissues contain stem cell populations that
renew through asymmetrical division and give rise to
progenitors committed to functional differentiation [1].
Cancer stem-like cells are similarly capable of selfrenewal and have the capacity for generating diverse
progeny that comprise the tumor [1, 2]. Stem-like
cells from hematologic malignancies and solid tumors
have thus been defined in part by their self-renewal
and tumor-initiating potential [3]. Nonetheless, debate
remains about the definition of cancer stem-like cells
as a result of their heterogeneity and plasticity [4, 5].
In this context, cell surface markers, such as CD44 and
CD133, have been used to isolate subsets enriched for

in both the acquisition of mesenchymal traits necessary
for invasion and metastases, and the expression of CSC
markers [8]. EMT also increases the capacity of mammary
epithelial cells to form mammospheres in non-adherent
serum-free culture [8], a characteristic that is dependent
on the presence of self-renewing stem cells [9, 10]. The
capacity for mammosphere formation has thus emerged
as another hallmark of the breast cancer stem-like cell [9].
From a mechanistic standpoint, NF-κB signaling has been
linked to self-renewal, mammosphere formation and breast
cancer-initiating cells [11-13]. In addition, interleukin-8
(IL-8), an inflammatory cytokine that is upregulated in
breast cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis [14],
has been identified as an important regulator of EMT,
stem-like cell activity and mammosphere formation [1518].
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a heterodimeric transmembrane
protein that is aberrantly overexpressed in human breast
cancers as a result in part of MUC1 gene amplification and
dysregulation of its transcription [19]. The functional role
of MUC1 in tumorigenesis was advanced by the finding
that MUC1 undergoes autocleavage into two subunits,
which in turn form a stable non-covalent heterodimer
[19]. The extracellular N-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) is
the mucin component of the heterodimer and is tethered
to the cell surface in a complex with the transmembrane
C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) [19]. MUC1-C consists of a
58-amino acid (aa) extracellular domain, a transmembrane
region and a 72-aa cytoplasmic tail [19]. MUC1-C
interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as
EGFR and HER2, at the cell membrane and contributes to
their activation [19, 20]. In this way, targeting MUC1-C
with silencing downregulates p-HER2 activation in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells [20]. Moreover,
inhibition of MUC1-C with GO-203, a cell penetrating
peptide that binds to the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain
at the CQC motif and blocks MUC1-C function [21, 22],
suppresses p-HER2 activation [20]. MUC1-C has also
been linked to regulation of downstream RTK signaling,
such as the PI3KAKT and MEKERK pathways [19,
20, 23]. In addition, MUC1-C is imported into the nucleus
by importin-β, where it interacts with transcription factors
and contributes to their transactivating function [19, 24].
In this regard, MUC1-C associates with NF-κB p65 and
induces activation of the ZEB1 gene by a NF-κB-mediated
mechanism [25]. In turn, ZEB1 suppresses miR-200c
expression and thereby induces EMT and cellular invasion
by a MUC1-C-mediated mechanism [25]. In addition,
recent studies have shown that MUC1-C interacts with
the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) on the
ALDH1A1 gene promoter and induces C/EBPβ-mediated
ALDH1A1 expression [23]. The available evidence thus
links MUC1-C to the induction of EMT [25] and ALDH
activity [23], both characteristics of breast cancer stemlike cell populations. Other studies of breast cancer cells
have demonstrated that MUC1 is detectable in “side
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

populations” that express the ABCG2 transporter, which
has been used as marker of stem/progenitor cells [26].
Overexpression of MUC1, as found in breast cancer cells,
is also associated with resistance to apoptosis in response
to genotoxic anti-cancer agents [27]. One study has
demonstrated that MUC1 expression is increased in breast
cancer cells that form mammospheres [28]; whereas,
another publication reported that MUC1 is decreased
under these conditions of anchorage-independent growth
[29]. Of relevance to the present work, there is no
available information that addresses whether MUC1-C is
involved in mammosphere formation or in activation of
the IL-8 pathway that contributes to the growth of breast
cancer cells as spheres.
The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C is
upregulated under nonadherent culture conditions, which
select for self-renewing breast cancer cells. The results
further demonstrate that silencing MUC1-C blocks the
capacity of luminal, HER2-overexpressing and triplenegative breast cancer cells to form mammospheres.
Targeting MUC1-C homodimerization by expression of a
MUC1-C(CQCAQA) mutant or the MUC1-C inhibitor
GO-203 also blocks self-renewal of breast cancer cells.
The mechanistic basis for these results is supported by the
demonstration that MUC1-C activates NF-κB and thereby
expression of IL-8 and CXCR1. Our findings indicate that
targeting MUC1-C represents an approach to inhibit the
self-renewal capacity of breast cancer cells.

RESULTS
MUC1-C expression is upregulated in MCF-7 cell
mammospheres.
To assess the potential involvement of MUC1-C
in conferring anchorage-independent growth, luminal
ER+ MCF-7 breast cancer cells were established as
mammospheres and serially passaged for three generations
(M1 to M3) (Fig. 1A). MUC1-C expression was found
to be substantially upregulated in M1, M2 and M3
mammospheres as compared to that in MCF-7 cells grown
as an adherent monolayer (Fig. 1B). In concert with the
demonstration that MUC1-C activates ERKC/EBPβ
signaling and induction of ALDH1A1 [23], we found
activation of this pathway in MCF-7 mammospheres as
evidenced by increased p-ERK, p-C/EBPβ and ALDH1A1
levels (Fig. 1C). In addition, the upregulation of MUC1-C
expression in MCF-7 mammospheres was associated with
increases in aldefluor activity (Fig. 1D). Based on these
findings, we silenced MUC1-C in MCF-7 cells to assess
its functional role in sphere formation (Fig. 1E). Notably,
MUC1-C silencing resulted in a significant reduction
in mammosphere formation as indicated by marked
decreases in both sphere size (Fig. 1F, left) and sphere

MUC1-C is of functional importance for growth of breast
cancer cells under anchorage-independent conditions.

contributes to mammosphere formation, we silenced
ALDH1A1 in MCF-7/MUC1-C cells (Fig. 2E). Of note,
downregulation of ALDH1A1 expression had no apparent
effect on mammosphere size (Fig. 2F, left) or SFE (Fig.
2F, right), indicating that MUC1-C confers non-adherent
growth by an ALDH1A1-independent mechanism.

mammosphere

HER2-overexpressing and triple-negative breast
cancer cells are dependent on MUC1-C for
mammosphere formation.

To further address the notion that MUC1-C
regulates mammosphere formation, we generated MCF7 cells that stably overexpress the MUC1-C subunit
(Fig. 2A). MUC1-C overexpression had little effect on
M1 mammosphere size (Fig. 2B, left), but significantly
increased SFE from 3-4% to over 15% (Fig. 2B, right).
MCF-7/MUC1-C cells also generated M2 and M3
mammospheres that were somewhat more diffuse (Fig.
2C) than that observed with MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A), a
finding that has been attributed to the development of
EMT characteristics [30]. Adherent MCF-7/MUC1-C cells
exhibit upregulation of the ERKC/EBPβALDH1A1
pathway [23]. Similar findings were observed in the MCF7/MUC1-C cells grown as mammospheres as supported
by increased p-C/EBPβ and ALDH1A1 levels (Fig. 2D).
To determine whether MUC1-C-induced ALDH1 activity

To extend these findings with luminal MCF-7 cells
to other breast cancer cell types, we first studied HER2overexpressing SKBR3 cells. As found for MCF-7 cells,
stable silencing of MUC1-C in SKBR3 cells (Fig. 3A)
was associated with a marked decrease in mammosphere
size (Fig. 3B, left) and SFE (Fig. 3B, right). Silencing
MUC1-C in triple-negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) MDAMB-468 cells (Fig. 3C) also resulted in substantial
suppression of mammosphere size (Fig. 3D, left) and
SFE (Fig. 3D, right), indicating that these effects of
silencing MUC1-C are independent of breast cancer cell
subtype. Similar results were obtained when MUC1-C

was downregulated in MDA-MB-468 cells using a
different shRNA (Supplemental Figs. S1A and B), further
indicating that the findings are not the result of shRNA offtarget effects. Silencing MUC1-C in MDA-MB-468 cells
causes downregulation of the ERKC/EBPβALDH1
pathway and loss of ALDH1 activity [23]. We therefore
silenced ALDH1A1 in MDA-MB-468 cells to assess their
dependence on ALDH1A1 for sphere formation (Fig. 3E).
As found for MCF-7 cells, the results demonstrate that
MDA-MB-468 mammosphere formation is conferred by a
MUC1-C-dependent, ALDH1A1-independent mechanism
(Fig. 3F, left and right).

for conferring anchorage-independent growth. Previous
work showed that MUC1-C homodimerization is inhibited
by the cell-penetrating peptide, GO-203, which contains a
poly-Arg transduction domain linked to CQCRRKN and
binds to endogenous MUC1-C at the CQC motif [21](Fig.
4A). Notably, GO-203 treatment blocked the formation of
MDA-MB-468 mammospheres (Fig. 4D). By contrast, the
CP-2 peptide, which includes AQARRKN and is not active
in targeting the MUC1-C CQC motif (Fig. 4A) [21], had
no apparent effect on sphere formation (Fig. 4D, left and
right). GO-203, but not CP-2, treatment for 36 h was also
highly effective in disrupting established MDA-MB-468
mammospheres (Fig. 4E). Moreover, established SKBR3
mammospheres were disrupted by targeting MUC1-C with
GO-203 (Fig. 4F), providing further evidence that supports
the importance of MUC1-C in conferring anchorageindependent growth and self-renewal.

Targeting MUC1-C homodimerization abrogates
mammosphere formation.
The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain contains a CQC
motif that is necessary for the formation of MUC1-C
homodimers and thereby the MUC1-C oncogenic
function (Fig. 4A) [19]. To search for further evidence
linking MUC1-C to mammosphere formation, we
stably expressed a MUC1-C(CQCAQA) mutant in
MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 4B). MUC1-C(CQCAQA)
expression was associated with marked suppression
of MDA-MB-468 mammosphere formation (Fig. 4C),
indicating that MUC1-C homodimerization is necessary

MUC1-C induces mammosphere formation by an
NF-κB-dependent mechanism.
Activation of the NF-κB pathway has been linked to
breast cancer-initiating cell activity [11-13]. Other studies
have shown that aberrant expression of MUC1-C activates
NF-κB signaling [24, 31]. Therefore, to determine whether
MUC1-C confers mammosphere formation through

induction of NF-κB, we first asked if overexpression of
MUC1-C in MCF-7 cells is associated with an increase
in NF-κB activity. Using an NF-κB-driven promoterreporter, we found a significant increase in NF-κB activity
in MCF-7/MUC1-C cells as compared to that obtained
in MCF-7/vector cells (Fig. 5A). Treatment of MCF-7/
MUC1-C cells with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7085
was associated with suppression of NF-κB activity (Fig.
5B). Moreover, MUC1-C-induced MCF-7 mammosphere
formation was inhibited by BAY11-7085 (Figs. 5C,
left and right), indicating that MUC1-C induces NF-κB
activity and thereby anchorage-independent growth.
With regard to downstream signaling, NF-κB has been

shown to confer stemness and the formation of spheres
by upregulating expression of IL-8 [32, 33]. In this
context, we observed marked increases in IL-8 mRNA
levels in MCF-7/MUC1-C, as compared to MCF-7/
vector, cells (Fig. 5D) that was suppressed in MCF-7/
MUC1-C cells by inhibition of NF-κB with BAY11-7085
(Fig. 5E). MUC1-C binds directly to NF-κB p65 and
promotes recruitment of MUC1-C/NF-κB complexes to
the promoters of NF-κB target genes [24]. By extension,
ChIP analysis of the IL-8 promoter, which contains an NFκB binding site, demonstrated that NF-κB p65 occupancy
is increased in MCF-7/MUC1-C cells (Fig. 5F) and that,
in re-ChIP studies, MUC1-C is detectable on the IL-8

provided support for a mechanism in which MUC1-C
activates NF-κB and thereby induces IL-8 expression and
mammosphere formation.

associated with decreases in IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 6C).
To extend this line of investigation to MDA-MB-468 cells,
we found that silencing MUC1-C similarly suppresses
NF-κB activity (Fig. 6D), NF-κB occupancy on the IL-8
promoter (Fig. 6E) and IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 6F). We
also found that MDA-MB-468 cells stably silenced for
NF-κB p65 (Supplemental Fig. S2A) exhibit decreases
in IL-8 expression (Supplemental Fig. S2B). Moreover,
as shown for MDA-MB-468/MUC1shRNA cells,
silencing NF-κB p65 was associated with suppression of
mammosphere formation (Supplemental Fig. S2C, left
and right). These findings thus provided further support
for activation of a MUC1-CNF-κBIL-8 pathway.
Targeting MUC1-C downregulates both IL-8 and
CXCR1 expression. Other work has shown that NFκB induces expression of the IL-8 receptor, CXCR1
[36]. In this regard and like IL-8, CXCR1 expression
was increased in MCF-7/MUC1-C cells (Fig. 7A, left).
Additionally, MUC1-C-induced increases in CXCR1
expression were inhibited by BAY11-7085 (Fig. 7A,

Silencing MUC1-C suppresses IL-8 mRNA levels.
Activation of HER2 in breast cancer cells promotes
stemness and sphere formation by upregulation of NF-κB
and IL-8 signaling [34, 35]. Moreover, IL-8 plays a critical
role in the acquisition and maintenance of EMT [17]. Our
observation that silencing MUC1-C in SKBR3 cells blocks
mammosphere formation (Figs. 3B and C) thus prompted
studies to evaluate NF-κB activation and IL-8 expression
in this model. As compared to SKBR3/CshRNA cells,
downregulation of MUC1-C in SKBR3/MUC1shRNA
cells was associated with suppression of NF-κB activity
(Fig. 6A) and NF-B occupancy on the IL-8 promoter
(Fig. 6B). Silencing MUC1-C in SKBR3 cells was also

right), supporting an NF-κB-mediated mechanism.
Blocking MUC1-C homodimerization with GO-203
disrupts the interaction with NF-κB p65 and activation
of the NF-κB pathway [24]. In this regard, treatment of
MCF-7/MUC1-C cells with GO-203 was associated with
downregulation of both IL-8 (Fig. 7B, left) and CXCR1
(Fig. 7B, right). GO-203, but not CP-2, treatment was
also associated with disruption of established MCF-7/
MUC1-C mammospheres (Fig. 7C). In concert with
these findings and the downregulation of IL-8 (Fig. 6F),
silencing MUC1-C in MDA-MB-468 cells was associated
with decreases in CXCR1 mRNA levels (Fig. 7D). Similar
results were obtained in MDA-MB-468 cells silenced
for NF-κB p65 (Supplemental Fig. S3), confirming the
induction of CXCR1 expression by an NF-κB-dependent
mechanism. To extend these observations, we investigated
the effects of silencing MUC1-C on tumorigenicity of
MDA-MB-468 cells. In concert with a decrease in the

capacity for mammosphere formation, growth of MDAMB-468/MUC1shRNA cells as tumor xenografts was
substantially inhibited as compared to that obtained for
MDA-MB-468/CshRNA cells (Fig. 7E, left and right).
qRT-PCR analysis of the MDA-MB-468 cells growing
as tumors further demonstrated that silencing MUC1-C
results in decreased expression of IL-8 (Fig. 7F, left)
and CXCR1 (Fig. 7F, right). These findings collectively
indicated that targeting MUC1-C suppresses NFκBIL-8/CXCR1 signaling and thereby mammosphere
formation and tumorigenicity.

DISCUSSION
MUC1 is aberrantly overexpressed in luminal,
HER2+ and basal-like triple-negative breast cancers
[19, 37] as a result in part of MUC1 gene alterations and
dysregulation of transcription [19]. The MUC1-C subunit

has also been linked to ER function [38-40] and HER2
activation [20] in breast cancer cells. Strikingly, however,
little is known about whether MUC1-C is of importance
for the growth and survival of breast cancer cells that
have the capacity for self-renewal. The present studies
demonstrate that growth of luminal MCF-7 breast cancer
cells as mammospheres, which enriches for self-renewing
breast cancer cells that survive anoikis under nonadherent
conditions [9, 10], is associated with substantial
upregulation of MUC1-C expression. Consistent with
a potential functional role, silencing MUC1-C in MCF7 cells decreased mammosphere formation. In addition,
overexpression of MUC1-C in this model increased sphere
forming efficiency. Anchorage-independent growth is
associated with induction of ALDH1 activity, supporting
ALDH1 as a marker of human mammary stem cells
[41]. Additionally, recent studies in MCF-7 and other
breast cancer cells have shown that MUC1-C increases
ALDH1A1 expression [23], raising the possibility
that MUC1-C induces ALDH1 activity and thereby
mammosphere formation. However, silencing ALDH1A1

in MCF-7/MUC1-C cells had no apparent effect on
mammosphere formation, indicating that MUC1-C confers
mammosphere formation by an alternative mechanism
(Fig. 7G). To provide further support for involvement of
MUC1-C in self-renewal activity, we silenced MUC1-C in
HER2+ SKBR3 and triple-negative MDA-MB-468 cells.
Here again, downregulation of MUC1-C significantly
decreased the capacity of these breast cancer cells to
form mammospheres. Silencing MUC1-C in MDAMB-468 cells is also associated with suppression of
ALDH1 activity [23]. However, consistent with findings
in MCF-7/MUC1-C cells, silencing ALDH1A1 in MDAMB-468 cells had little if any effect on mammosphere
formation, indicating that increases in ALDH1A1 activity
are dispensable for anchorage-independent growth (Fig.
7G). Other work has shown that MUC1-C induces EMT
in breast cancer cells by activating the ZEB1/miR-200c
regulatory loop [25]. In this context, EMT increases
the capacity of mammary epithelial cells to form
mammospheres [8], providing an alternative mechanism
by which MUC1-C could promote non-adherent growth

and survival (Fig. 7G).
MUC1-C contributes to activation of the canonical
NF-κB pathway [31]. MUC1-C also interacts directly
with NF-κB p65 and promotes activation of NF-κBdependent genes [24]. Other work has linked NF-κB
activation to mammosphere formation and breast cancerinitiating activity [11-13, 34]. In this respect, we found
that inhibition of MUC1-C-induced NF-κB activity is
associated with suppression of self-renewal mammosphere
formation, indicating that MUC1-C induces anchorageindependent growth by an NF-κB-mediated pathway.
The available evidence supports involvement of NF-κB
in conferring stemness and sphere formation by inducing
IL-8 signaling [35, 36, 42]. Indeed, consistent with

induction of the IL-8 pathway, MUC1-C increased NF-κB
occupancy of the IL-8 promoter and inhibition of MUC1-C
resulted in downregulation of IL-8 expression. The
proximal promoter of the IL-8 gene has adjacent NF-κBand C/EBP-binding sites that cooperate in transactivation
[42, 43]. In addition, NF-κB and C/EBP physically form
complexes on target gene promoters and cooperate in
the activation of IL-8 transcription [44]. C/EBPβ plays
an important role in mammary gland development by
regulating stem cell repopulating activity [45]. Indeed,
recent studies have shown that MUC1-C interacts with
C/EBPβ, occupies the ALDH1A1 promoter with C/EBPβ
and thereby contributes to upregulation of ALDH1A1
expression [23]. Therefore, the present studies do not

(i) NF-κB p65-mediated induction of ZEB1 and EMT [25], and (ii) ERKC/EBPβ signaling and ALDH1A1 expression [23]. Our results
demonstrate that silencing ALDH1A1 has no detectable effect on mammosphere formation, indicating that the MUC1-CNF-κB and
MUC1-CALDH1A1 pathways confer distinct functions.

exclude the possibility that MUC1-C may further enhance
IL-8 transcription by promoting interaction between NFκB p65 and C/EBPβ on the IL-8 promoter. Consistent with
MUC1-C-induced activation of NF-κB and the presence of
a functional NF-κB binding site on the CXCR1 promoter,
we also found that MUC1-C drives CXCR1 expression by
an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. These findings support
a pathway in which MUC1-C activates NF-κB and induces
IL-8 and CXCR1 expression, which in turn drives selfrenewal capacity and mammosphere formation (Fig. 7G).
Thus, in this model, targeting MUC1-C is sufficient to
suppress the IL-8/CXCR1 signaling pathway and decrease
self-renewal. Other work has shown that that IL-6 can
contribute to MCF-7 mammosphere formation [46] and
IL-8-mediated survival [43]. Accordingly, additional
studies will be needed to determine whether MUC1-C also
contributes to the regulation of IL-6 expression in breast
cancer cells.
MUC1-C forms complexes with HER2/HER3 at
the breast cancer cell membrane and contributes to their
activation [19, 20]. The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain
contains a CQC motif that is necessary and sufficient
for the formation of MUC1-C homodimers, which are of
importance for MUC1-C function [19]. Thus, targeting
MUC1-C with silencing or by blocking the CQC motif
in HER2+ breast cancer cells results in inhibition of
p-HER2 activation and the downstream AKT pathway
[20]. HER2 drives stem cell-like activity by AKTβ
catenin signaling [47, 48] and through an interaction
between HER2 and CXCR1/2 [18]. Therefore, the present
finding that targeting MUC1-C in HER2+ SKBR3 cells
inhibits mammosphere formation could be a consequence
of p-HER2 downregulation. Nonetheless, we also found
that silencing MUC1-C suppresses the formation of triplenegative MDA-MB-468 mammospheres. In addition,
expression of the MUC1-C(CQCAQA) mutant blocked
MDA-MB-468 sphere formation, indicating that the
MUC1-C CQC motif and MUC1-C homodimerization
are necessary for anchorage-independent growth. The
formation of MUC1-C homodimers is also necessary for
import of MUC1-C into the nucleus, where it interacts
with transcription factors, such as NF-κB [19]. Thus,
targeting MUC1-C homodimerization by treatment
with inhibitors, such as GO-203, blocks MUC1-Cinduced activation of the NF-κB pathway [24], and
thereby induction of IL-8/CXCR1 expression and
mammosphere formation. Previous studies with other cellpenetrating peptides that bind to the MUC1-C CQC motif
demonstrated that blocking MUC1-C homodimerization is
effective in killing breast cancer cells growing in vitro and
as tumor xenografts [49]. The present work extends these
observations by demonstrating that silencing MUC1-C
in MDA-MB-468 cells markedly inhibits tumorigenicity.
These effects of targeting MUC1-C are associated with
increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the
induction of late apoptosis/necrosis [49]. By extension,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MUC1-C protects cells from increases in ROS associated
with exposure to hypoxia and glucose deprivation [19].
Increasing evidence indicates that cancer stem-like cells
maintain low ROS levels and that disruption of ROS
defense mechanisms results in loss of their survival [5053]. In this way, dependence of breast cancer cell survival
on activation of NF-κB, and thereby cytokine signaling
that can further activate NF-κB in a positive feedback
loop, may contribute to maintenance of ROS levels and
self-renewal. Therefore, based on the present findings,
targeting MUC1-C in breast cancer-initiating cells with
downregulation of NF-κB activation could in turn disrupt
redox balance and induce loss of self-renewal.
Finally, a Phase I trial of GO-203 has been
completed in patients with refractory solid tumors and,
as a result, definition of a maximum tolerated dose for
Phase II studies. The finding that targeting MUC1-C with
GO-203 inhibits self-renewal of breast cancer stem-like
cells supports further evaluation of GO-203 alone and in
combination with other agents used for the treatment of
breast cancer. In this way, GO-203 has been synergistically
combined with tamoxifen [40], trastuzumab [20] and the
cytotoxic drugs, taxol and doxorubicin [54], and therefore
could be used clinically with these agents to more
effectively treat the breast cancer stem-like, initiating cell
population.

METHODS
Cell culture.
Human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer
cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100
μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. SKBR3
breast cancer cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium
containing FBS, antibiotics and glutamine. MCF-7,
MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 cells were transduced with
a lentiviral vector expressing a MUC1 shRNA (Sigma),
a NF-κB p65 shRNA (Sigma) or, as a control, with a
scrambled shRNA vector (CshRNA) as described [23].
MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with a control pHRCMV vector or one expressing MUC1-C [23]. Cells were
treated with the MUC1-C inhibitor GO-203, the control
CP-2 [20] or the NF-κB pathway inhibitor BAY11-7085
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting.
Whole cell lysates were prepared in NP-40 lysis
buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with antiMUC1-C (LabVision), anti-NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and anti-β-actin (Sigma) as described
[25]. Immune complexes were detected using horseradish

mammospheres were harvested, incubated with trypsin
for 3 min at 37°C, and mechanically dispersed by gentle
pipetting. Single cells were confirmed under a microscope,
counted and resuspended in fresh MammoCult™ medium.
Mammospheres were visualized using a Nikon inverted
TE2000 microscope and scored as positive when ≥50 µm
in size. Sphere forming efficiency (SFE) was calculated
by dividing the number of mammospheres by the number
of suspended cells.

Quantitative RT-PCR.
For qRT-PCR analysis, cDNA synthesis was
performed with 1 μg total RNA using the Thermoscript
RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). cDNA samples were
amplified using the SYBR green qPCR assay kit
(Applied Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence
Detector (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for qRTPCR detection of IL-8 and CXCR1 mRNAs are listed
in Supplemental Table S1. Statistical significance was
determined by the Student’s t-test.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.
Soluble chromatin was prepared from 2-3 x 106
cells as described [23] and precipitated with anti-NF-κB
or a control nonimmune IgG. For re-ChIP assays, NFκB complexes from the primary ChIP were eluted and
reimmunoprecipitated with anti-MUC1-C as described
[23]. The SYBR green qPCR kit was used for ChIP qPCRs
with the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied
Biosystems). Relative fold enrichment was calculated
as described [55]. Primers used for qPCR of the IL-8
promoter and control region are listed in Supplemental
Table S2.

NF-κB transcriptional activity.
Cells (5 x 105) growing in six-well plates were
transfected in the presence of Superfect transfection
reagent (Qiagen) with (i) 1 µg of the p-NF-κB-Luc
plasmid containing NF-κB-activated sequences upstream
to the luciferase reporter (pGL4.32/luc2P/NF-κB-RE/
Hygro; Promega) and (ii) 1 ng of a control reporter
plasmid (pRL-TK) containing the Renilla gene under
control of the TK promoter. After 48 h, the cells were
harvested and lysed in passive lysis buffer. Luciferase
activity was analyzed using the Dual Luciferase Assay
System (Promega). Relative luciferase activity is reported
as the fold-induction after normalization for transfection
efficiency.

Assessment of tumorigenicity.
MDA-MB-468/CshRNA and MDA-MB-468/
MUC1shRNA cells growing in log-phase cultures were
trypsinized and washed twice with sterile PBS. Viable
cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells
(4 x 106) suspended in 0.2 ml sterile PBS were injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of 4-6 week old female
BALB/c nu/nu mice. Tumor volumes were calculated
using the formula V=(L x W2)/2, where L and W are the
larger and smaller diameters, respectively.

Measurement of ALDH activity.
The Aldefluor assay kit (Stem Cell Technologies)
was used for determination of ALDH enzymatic
activity. Cells were suspended in aldefluor assay buffer
and incubated with the ALDH enzyme substrate,
BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA), for 40 min
at 37°C. As a control, cells were also treated with
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), an inhibitor of ALDH
enzyme activity. Fluorescence was determined using a BD
Biosciences LSRFortessa flow cytometer and analyzed
using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Statistical
significance was determined by the Student’s t-test.
