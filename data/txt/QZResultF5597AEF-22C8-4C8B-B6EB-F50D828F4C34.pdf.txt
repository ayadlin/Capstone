ABSTRACT
Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor that contains a small subpopulation of
tumor-propagating cells (also known as tumor-initiating cells) characterized by drug
resistance and high metastatic potential. The molecular mechanism by which tumorpropagating cells promote tumor growth is poorly understood. Here, we report that
the transcription factor forkhead box C2 (FOXC2) is frequently expressed in human
osteosarcomas and is important in maintaining osteosarcoma cells in a stem-like
state. In osteosarcoma cell lines, we show that anoikis conditions stimulate FOXC2
expression. Downregulation of FOXC2 decreases anchorage-independent growth
and invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo, while overexpression of FOXC2
increases tumor propagation in vivo. In osteosarcoma cell lines, we demonstrate
that high levels of FOXC2 are associated with and required for the expression of
osteosarcoma tumor-propagating cell markers. In FOXC2 knockdown cell lines, we
show that CXCR4, a downstream target of FOXC2, can restore osteosarcoma cell
invasiveness and metastasis to the lung.

population of undifferentiated cancer cells with stemlike properties [5, 6]. Identifying molecular pathways
that regulate the maintenance and expansion of tumorpropagating cells is critical to designing effective targeted
therapy against these cells [7].
Conditions that generate and sustain tumorpropagating cells are not completely understood. It is
thought that the signaling pathways involved in cellular
differentiation are dysregulated within a tumor tissue
environment, leading to cancer cells with stem-like
properties [8]. Previous studies that focused on phenotypic
characterization of tumor-propagating cells have used
various cell surface markers known to induce stem-like
and mesenchymal phenotypes and/or drug resistance,
such as CD117, Stro-1, CXCR4 and ABCG2, and CD133
[9–12].

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcomas are aggressive bone malignancies
derived from osteoblast progenitor cells of mesenchymal
origin [1]. These primary bone tumors, which frequently
arise during period of rapid bone growth, most commonly
affect children and young adults and are the second highest
cause of cancer-related death in children and adolescents
[2]. Micrometastases are detected in approximately 90%
of patients during initial diagnosis. Despite advancements
in neoadjuvant therapy and treatment, the survival rate
has remained at 60% for the past decade [3]. It has been
suggested that the lack of improvement in survival may be
due to the inability to effectively target tumor-propagating
cells in osteosarcoma [4]. Accumulating evidence shows
that tumor-propagating cells originate from a small

FOXC2 is a gene involved in epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biological process
acquired by cancer cells during cancer progression [13].
Overexpression of FOXC2 in an immortalized human
mammary epithelial cell line expressing the ras oncogene
(HMLER) resulted in a more mesenchymal stem-like state
[14]. It has been shown that elevated FOXC2 expression
is associated with increased metastasis in several cancer
types, including breast, colorectal, nasopharingeal and
esophageal [15–21]. In colorectal and esophageal cancer,
FOXC2 expression correlated with poor prognosis and
the loss of FOXC2 function decreased the invasive and
migratory abilities of cancer cells in vitro [15, 17–19].
It is unknown if FOXC2 plays a role in nonepithelial malignancies where EMT is not essential for
tumor progression. Because of the presence of FOXC2 in
skeletal precursor cells [22] and involvement in osteogenic
differentiation [23–26], we hypothesized that FOXC2
may play a role in a tumor type with altered osteogenic
differentiation, such as osteosarcoma. In this study, we
investigated the role of FOXC2 in osteosarcoma growth
and metastasis. We demonstrate that FOXC2 plays a
critical role in osteosarcoma pathogenesis by enhancing
the ability of tumor-propagating cells to metastasize and
propagate tumors.

elevated in several cancer types, including osteosarcoma
(data not shown). Additionally, FOXC2 mRNA was
upregulated in osteosarcoma samples in comparison
to normal bone (Supplementary Figure S1A) and in
osteosarcoma lung metastases in comparison to primary
tumors (Supplementary Figure S1B). We assessed the
protein levels of FOXC2 in tumor tissue biopsies from
patients diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma, embryonal
rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. While positive
FOXC2 immunostaining was observed in 3 of 7 Ewing’s
sarcomas and 1 of 2 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, 9
of 10 examined osteosarcomas were positive for FOXC2
with 7 tumors exhibiting strong staining and the remaining
2 tumors exhibiting weak staining (Supplementary
Table S1). Positive FOXC2 staining was observed in
primary bone lesions as well as in lung metastases from
osteosarcoma patients (Figure 1). The frequent detection
of FOXC2 expression in human osteosarcomas suggests
a possible involvement of FOXC2 in osteosarcoma
pathology.

Anoikis increases FOXC2 expression in
osteosarcoma cell lines
To assess the potential involvement of FOXC2 in
the metastatic capability of osteosarcoma, we analyzed
the effects of culture conditions in the osteosarcoma cell
lines 143B (exhibits high endogenous levels of FOXC2)
and in SJSA1 and U2OS (exhibit moderate endogenous
levels of FOXC2) (Figure 2A). Metastatic dissemination
requires the detachment of cells from the primary tumor
and survival in anoikis conditions. To simulate anoikis,
osteosarcoma cell lines were grown in non-adherent cell
culture dishes. In comparison to adherent conditions,
expression of the FOXC2 protein (Figure 2A) and mRNA

SJSA1 and U2OS cell lines to levels comparable to the
metastatic cell line 143B. These data indicate that survival
in anoikis conditions may be aided by FOXC2 expression.

resulted in visibly decreased size and number of soft agar
colonies in both cell lines (Figure 3B). To determine if
FOXC2 contributes to invasive capability of 143B and
U2OS cells, we performed the Matrigel invasion assay
and evaluated the amount of cells that invaded a Matrigel
after 48 hours. Our results show that downregulation of
FOXC2 decreases the ability of 143B and U2OS cells to
break down extracellular matrix and migrate toward the
chemoattractant (Figure 3C).

Silencing of FOXC2 expression attenuates
anchorage-independent growth and invasion
capabilities of osteosarcoma cells in vitro
To study the loss-of-function of FOXC2 in
osteosarcoma cell lines, FOXC2 was silenced using
lentiviral shRNA transduction in the 143B and U2OS
cell lines, which have relatively high and moderate
endogenous levels of FOXC2, respectively. Western
blotting and qRT-PCR analyses of the FOXC2 protein and
mRNA expression were used to assess the efficiency of
FOXC2 silencing in cell lines transduced with FOXC2
shRNAs in comparison to the respective control cells
transduced with scrambled shRNA (scr) (Figure 3A).
Cell lines with the most effective knockdown of FOXC2,
143B-FOXC2 sh1 and U2OS-FOXC2 sh3, were selected
for in vitro functional analyses. We confirmed that
FOXC2 knockdown did not alter the proliferation rate or
viability of these cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2).
Malignant cancer is characterized by its ability to survive
without support from the basement membrane, which
can be mimicked in vitro by anchorage-independent
growth in soft agar. To analyze the effect of FOXC2
downregulation on anchorage-independent growth, 143B
and U2OS osteosarcoma cells with scrambled shRNA
and with FOXC2-specific shRNAs were assessed for
colony formation in soft agar. Downregulation of FOXC2

Silencing of FOXC2 expression results in
decreased metastatic seeding of osteosarcoma
cells in vivo
The highly aggressive osteosarcoma cell line 143B
has been shown to metastasize to the lungs after injection
of cells into nude mice [27]. Metastatic seeding in vivo
was assessed by injecting 143B scr, 143B sh1, and 143B
sh2 cells into nude mice via the tail vein. Mice were
monitored for tumor development for up to 28 days. Two
mice injected with 143B scr cells became moribund at
days 16 and 21. Necropsy revealed that both mice had
tumor nodules in the lung. At day 28, all surviving mice
were euthanized and their lungs were harvested, fixed
in formalin and scored for tumor nodules visible to the
eye. More mice injected with 143B scr cells developed
visible lung nodules (6 out of 10 mice) compared to 143B
sh1 (0 out of 10 mice) and 143B sh2 (1 out of 5 mice)
(Supplementary Table S2). Lungs from mice injected
with 143B scr and 143B sh1 cells were examined by
immunohistochemistry with antibodies against FOXC2
and the cellular marker of proliferation Ki-67. Multiple

large lung nodules were observed in mice injected with
143B scr cells (Figure 4). Microscopic tumor nodules
were observed in several lung sections of mice injected
with 143B sh1 cells but the nodules were FOXC2 positive,
indicating that they arose from cells with incomplete
knockdown of FOXC2 (Figure 4). These data suggest
that FOXC2 may play a critical role in osteosarcoma cell
invasion and metastasis to distant organs.

the SJSA1 osteosarcoma cell line, which has the lowest
levels of endogenous FOXC2 compared to the U2OS and
143B cell lines (Figure 2A). SJSA1 cells were transduced
with an empty vector (SJSA1-EV) or vector carrying
human FOXC2 (SJSA1-FOXC2). Increased expression
of the FOXC2 protein and mRNA in the SJSA1-FOXC2
cells was confirmed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR,
respectively (Figure 5A, 5B). In a soft agar assay, SJSA1FOXC2 cell colonies were visibly larger than SJSA1-EV
cell colonies (data not shown). To quantitatively analyze
the role of FOXC2 in tumor propagation, we injected
limiting dilutions of SJSA1-EV and SJSA1-FOXC2 cells
subcutaneously into nude mice and allowed for tumor
development up to 16 days. Mice injected with SJSA1FOXC2 cancer cells were able to form tumors with as low
as 1×103 cells, while SJSA1-EV cells injected at dilutions

(Figure 5C). Additionally, at 1×105 and 1×106 dilutions,
SJSA1-FOXC2 cells formed significantly bigger tumors
than SJSA1-EV cells (Figure 5C). Immunohistochemical
analysis confirmed higher levels of nuclear FOXC2
protein in the SJSA1-FOXC2 tumors in comparison to the
SJSA1-EV tumors (Figure 5D). These data suggest that
FOXC2 may be involved in enhancing the ability of tumor
cells to propagate tumor growth in vivo.

in a significant decrease in cell surface expression
of CD133/CD49f stem markers (Figure 6A and
Supplementary Figure S3). Next, we examined by
qRT-PCR if FOXC2 knockdown in U2OS cells affects
the expression of several genes known to be enriched
in tumor-propagating cells, such as the cell surface
marker CD133, multidrug resistance pump ABCG2,
Notch signaling receptor ligands JAG1 and BMP4, and
chemokine receptor CXCR4 [28–30]. We demonstrated
that U2OS cells with FOXC2 knockdown (U2OS
sh3) had decreased levels of CD133, ABCG2, JAG1,
BMP4 and CXCR4 in comparison to U2OS scr cells
(Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION

knockdown of FOXC2 in 143B cells leads to decreased
levels of CXCR4 mRNA (Figure 7A) and decreased
CXCR4-luciferase promoter activity (Figure 7B).
Forced re-expression of CXCR4 in the 143B FOXC2
knockdown cells restored their invasive capabilities in
vitro (Figure 7C) and in vivo (Table S2), indicating that
CXCR4 is a downstream target and a functional mediator
of FOXC2 signaling in osteosarcoma.

Osteosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric tumor
with poor overall prognosis despite advances in surgical
techniques and combination chemotherapy regimens [2].
Chemoresistance and recurrence due to early metastatic
dissemination are the major contributors to poor
prognosis. Osteosarcoma is a heterogeneous malignancy

consisting of phenotypically diverse cells with varying
degrees of differentiation [32]. In this hierarchy,
poorly-differentiated cancer cells with stem-cell
characteristics, also known as tumor-propagating cells,
are considered to be responsible for tumor initiation,
propagation, dissemination, metastasis, recurrence,
and chemotherapy resistance [6]. Targeting this cell
population may provide a novel strategy in the treatment
of osteosarcoma. Thus, there is great interest in key
signaling pathways responsible for the maintenance of
tumor-propagating cells.
In this study, we demonstrated that FOXC2
is required for many of the properties and functions

of osteosarcoma tumor-propagating cells, including
resistance to anoikis, increased migratory and invasive
capabilities. Previous studies have shown that FOXC2
directly regulates expression of the chemokine receptor
CXCR4 in endothelial cells during blood vessel formation
[31]. It has also been shown that CXCR4 is expressed
in osteosarcoma and may be involved in tumor lung
metastases [33]. In this study, we showed that FOXC2
regulates the expression of CXCR4 in osteosarcoma.
Reduced cell invasion and metastatic abilities of FOXC2
knockdown cell lines can be restored by overexpression of
CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 is a mediator of FOXC2
activity in osteosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Anoikis assay

Cell lines

Osteosarcoma cell lines were seeded at a density
of 1 × 106 cells per well in poly-HEMA-coated 6-well
plates. The cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 5
days prior to analysis. The media were changed regularly
to maintain the presence of growth factors and pH. Cells
were compared to input cells grown in normal adherent
growth conditions at 70-80% confluency. Cell viability

The human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS, 143B,
and SJSA1 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and were propagated in DMEM, 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS) at 37ºC with 5%
CO2. Early-passage cells were used for all experiments.

primers specific for the human target gene. The qRTPCR samples were prepared in triplicates using a 96-well
format plate in an iCycler optical module thermocycler
(Bio-Rad). Samples were normalized to GAPDH and 18s
ribosomal RNA and the 2-Δct values were determined for
analysis of relative gene expression.

Transduction of osteosarcoma cell lines with
plasmids

Western blot analysis

Detailed methods for lentiviral and retroviral
infection are described in our previous publication [24].
Briefly, the lentiviral plasmids pLKO.1 scrambled and
pLKO.1-FOXC2 sh (Sigma) were co-transfected with
the delta 8.9 packaging plasmid and envelope plasmid
VSVG into Lenti-X™ 293T cells using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) in a 10 cm2 dish. The retroviral vectors
pWZL-blast and pWZL-FOXC2 (provided by Sendurai
Mani, MD Anderson Cancer Center) were transfected
into LinXA cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
in a 10 cm2 dish. After 72 hours, viral supernatant was
harvested into a 50 ml conical tube using a 0.45 μm filter
syringe. Viral supernatants were concentrated (10X)
using either Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech) or a Retro-X
concentrator (Clontech) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of
cell media (DMEM, 10% FBS and 1% PS). Concentrated
lentivirus or retrovirus (200 μl with 8 μg/ml of polybrene)
was applied to the ostesarcoma cell lines 143B (pLKO.1),
U2OS (pLKO.1), and SJSA1 (pwzl), one day after seeding
3×104 cells/well. After 48 hours, 143B and U2OS cells
transduced with lentiviruses were selected using 10 μg/
ml of puromycin while SJSA1 cells transduced with
retroviruses were selected using 10 μg/ml of blasticidin.
pReciever-CXCR4 (EX-Z3039-M03, GeneCopoeia,
Inc.) was transfected into 143B-FOXC2 sh1 cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were selected with
500 μg/ml of Geneticin.

Whole cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer
(Sigma) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)
and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Proteins
(10-50 μg) were separated using 4-20% gradient TrisHCl
gel (Bio-Rad), transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane
(Bio-Rad) and incubated with antibodies against FOXC2
(N. Miura) and GAPDH (loading control) as described in
our previous publication [35]. Western blots were scanned
and analyzed using the Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imaging
system.

Soft agar assay
DMEM media (Cellgro) containing 0.8% sea plaque
agar, 10% FBS and 1% PS were layered into a 6-well plate
and incubated at room temperature overnight in a tissue
culture hood. The following day, 3×103 of SJSA1 and
5×103 of U2OS and 143B cells were resuspended in 0.5%
agar media and seeded onto the 0.8% agar. Cells were
incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 for 12 days and analyzed
for viable colonies using iodonotrotetraxolium chloride
staining (Sigma).

Cell invasion assay
Cells were seeded at 5×104 cells/well in the top
chamber of a BD Matrigel invasion chamber (BD
Bioscience). Media containing 10% FBS and 0% FBS
were added to the bottom wells as a chemoattractant and
negative control, respectively. Cells were incubated for
12-48 hours to allow for invasion through Matrigel and
then analyzed by histological staining (Diff-Quik, Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical studies involving human
tissue samples were approved by the Cedars-Sinai
Institutional Review Board. Formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated
and stained with antibodies against human FOXC2 (N.
Miura) at 1:100 dilution and Ki-67 (Santa Cruz) at 1:400
dilution using the protocol described in our previous
publication [34] except that 5% milk was used as a
blocking reagent.

Xenograft transplantation of human
osteosarcoma
All animal procedures were performed in
accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and approved by the CedarsSinai Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Eight week-old nude (Nu/Nu) mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Human
osteosarcoma cell lines were resuspended in PBS and
200 μl was subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Prior
to injection, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane
inhalation. To analyze osteosaroma lung metastasis,
2×106 143B cancer cells in 200 μl PBS were injected

cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time PCR
(qRT-PCR)
RNA was isolated from osteosarcoma cell lines
using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was
synthesized using the QuantiTect reverse transcription
kit (Qiagen). To perform qRT-PCR, 50 ng of cDNA
was added to iQSYBR-Green supermix (Bio-Rad) with
