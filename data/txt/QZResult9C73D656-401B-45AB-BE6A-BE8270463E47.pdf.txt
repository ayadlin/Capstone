Abstract
Efforts to improve cancer care in the developing world will benefit from the identification of simple,
inexpensive, and broadly applicable medical modalities based on emergent innovations in treatment, such
as targeting mechanisms of tumoral immune tolerance. In this report, we offer preclinical evidence that the
low-cost, anti-inflammatory agent ethyl pyruvate elicits a potent immune-based antitumor response through
inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a key tolerogenic enzyme for many human tumors. Consistent with its reported ability to interfere with NF-κB function, ethyl pyruvate blocks IDO induction both
in vitro and in vivo. Antitumor activity was achieved in mice with a noncytotoxic dosing regimen of ethyl
pyruvate shown previously to protect against lethality from sepsis. Similar outcomes were obtained with the
functional ethyl pyruvate analogue 2-acetamidoacrylate. Ethyl pyruvate was ineffective at suppressing tumor
outgrowth in both athymic and Ido1-deficient mice, providing in vivo corroboration of the importance of
T-cell–dependent immunity and IDO targeting for ethyl pyruvate to achieve antitumor efficacy. Although
ethyl pyruvate has undergone early-phase clinical testing, this was done without consideration of its possible applicability to cancer. Our findings that IDO is effectively blocked by ethyl pyruvate treatment deepen
emerging links between IDO and inflammatory processes. Further, these findings rationalize oncologic applications for this agent by providing a compelling basis to reposition ethyl pyruvate as a low-cost immunochemotherapy for clinical evaluation in cancer patients.

Introduction
Mounting evidence argues that immune escape through
the establishment of dominant, immune tolerance is a fundamental hallmark of tumor progression (1), and it is likely that
successful immunotherapy will require the implementation
of strategies to overcome this barrier through targeting of
tolerogenic determinants protecting the tumor (2). One
promising target for pharmacologic intervention in this regard is the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO; refs. 3, 4). Two closely related IDO isoforms encoded by the genes IDO1 and IDO2 have been identified. IDO2 appears to be expressed in a more restricted
range of tissue types than IDO1 (5, 6). The functional and
physiologic relevance of the IDO2 isoform has yet to be clearly delineated, while genetic evidence clearly supports the imAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Lankenau Institute for Medical Research,

portance of IDO1 in tumoral immune escape (7, 8). In
numerous clinical studies, IDO upregulation in cancer patients has been associated with a less favorable prognosis
(9), whereas, in various animal models of cancer, systemic
blockade of IDO activity with small-molecule inhibitors suppresses the outgrowth of tumors and cooperates with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or cancer vaccines to trigger
regression of tumors that are otherwise recalcitrant to treatment (7, 10, 11). These encouraging outcomes have sparked
interest in further discovery and development of inhibitors of
IDO signaling to evaluate as cancer therapeutics (12–16). One
approach to facilitating this process is to consider whether
any existing agents might leverage this immunologic mechanism to permit repositioning for cancer treatment.
In earlier studies of IDO dysregulation in cancer, we
showed that, in addition to the well-established JAK/STAT
signaling requirement, NF-κB signaling is also essential for
IDO induction in oncogenically transformed skin epithelial
cells (10). In a skin carcinogenesis model, we subsequently
showed that IDO is critical for inflammation-based tumor
promotion (8). Given the central involvement of NF-κB signaling in both cancer and inflammation, we speculated that
relieving IDO-mediated tumor tolerance may be a key mechanism whereby clinical agents that interfere with NF-κB signaling might exert an immunotherapeutic effect in cancer.
Among clinically evaluated anti-inflammatory agents that
have been shown to inhibit NF-κB signaling, ethyl pyruvate
is particularly notable as a simple, inexpensive, nontoxic food

additive that, via i.p. or i.v. route of administration, displays
in vivo efficacy in mouse models of sepsis and other inflammatory disorders (17). Here, we report preclinical evidence that
ethyl pyruvate can induce robust antitumor immune responses
through its ability to inhibit the in vivo expression of IDO.

Materials and Methods
Chemical compounds. Chemicals were purchased from the
following vendors: ethyl pyruvate (Aldrich), 2-acetamidoacrylate (2-AA; Fluka), 6-amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenylethylamino)
quinazoline (QNZ; Biomol), 1,1-dimethylethyl)-9-fluoro-3,6dihydro-7H-benz[h]-imidaz[4,5-f]isoquinolin-7-one (DBI; Calbiochem), and methyl-thiohydantoin tryptophan (MTH-Trp
or Necrostatin 1; Biomol). Stock solutions were prepared in
DMSO for use in cell-based assays.
Cell culture. Myc + Ras-transformed keratinocytes from a
Bin1-deficient mouse (Bin1−/− MR KECs) described previously (10) and B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells (American
Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone)
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech) at 37°C and 5%
CO2. U937 human monocytic cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum
(Mediatech), 55 μmol/L β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech) at 37°C and 5% CO2. Recombinant human IFN-γ (R&D Systems) was used at a final
concentration of 100 ng/mL, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma) were used at a final
concentration of 100 ng/mL.
Mice. C57BL/6 mice and athymic NCr-nu/nu (nude mice)
were obtained from National Cancer Institute-Frederick.
Congenic, homozygous Ido1-null mice on the C57BL/6 strain
background (Ido1-KO) described previously (18) were a kind
gift from Dr. Andrew Mellor (Medical College of Georgia). All
studies involving mice were approved by the Institutional
Animal Use Committee of the Lankenau Institute for Medical
Research.
IDO enzyme assays. To assess IDO activity in U937 cells,
kynurenine levels in the medium at 24 h post-induction
were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
coupled to electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy analysis as described (19) using a Varian 320-MS triplequadrupole mass spectrometry system. Quantitation of
kynurenine was based on analysis of two daughter ions.
Transcription assay. The transient transfection procedure was adapted from ref. 20 for electroporation of U937
cells, specifically 2 μg huIDOpro1245-luc with the luciferase
gene controlled by the human IDO1 promoter (-1,207 to
+38) adapted from ref. 21, 1 μg CMV-β-galactosidase (to
normalize for transfection efficiencies), and 2 μg pcDNA3.1
or CMV4-IκBα-SR expressing the (S32A/S36A) superrepressor mutant of IκBα (22). Total plasmid DNA in each transfection was made up to 25 μg with pUC19 carrier plasmid
DNA in a total of 50 μL of 0.1× TE and added to 0.3 mL
complete medium containing 5 × 106 U937 cells. Electroporation was carried out at 960 mF and 220 V using a Gene

1846

Cancer Res; 70(5) March 1, 2010

Pulser (Bio-Rad) using disposable electroporation cuvettes
with a 0.4 cm electrode gap (Denville Scientific). After electroporation, cells were left to recover for 48 h and then
stimulated with a combination of IFN-γ + LPS for 24 h and
then harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as
described previously (10).
Northern and Western blot analyses. Northern blot analysis of IDO was conducted using a human full-length cDNA
probe essentially as described (23). Western blot analysis
was done using standard methods. Antibodies to IDO1
(clone 10.1; ref. 10) and actin (1-19; sc-1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as described (24) or as recommended by the vendor. Immunoprecipitation of Ido1
protein from mouse lung tissue with purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (25) followed by Western blot–based detection with rat monoclonal antibody (clone mIDO-48;
Biolegend) was done as described (25).
Pharmacodynamic assay. IDO was induced in 8- to 10week-old C57BL/6 mice by intrapulmonary delivery of LPS
from E. coli 0111:B4 (Sigma). Mice anesthetized by inhalation
of isoflurane were instilled intranasally with 25 μg LPS in 25
μL sterile saline. Ethyl pyruvate was administered by i.p. injection at 40 mg/kg in 500 μL sterile modified Ringer's ethyl
pyruvate solution (in which ethyl pyruvate substitutes for lactate; ref. 26) immediately before LPS challenge and with repeated dosing at 6 and 24 h post-challenge. Mice were
euthanized at 24 h post-challenge by cervical dislocation,
and lung tissues were weighed and frozen on dry ice. For
analysis of kynurenine, frozen lung tissue samples were homogenized in PBS (1:4, w/v) and subjected to three rounds of
freeze/thaw lyses. Deproteinated lysates were analyzed by
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy analysis as described (19) using a Varian 320-MS triple-quadrupole mass
spectrometry system. Quantitation of kynurenine was based
on analysis of two daughter ions.
Tumor formation and drug response. Tumor graft experiments were carried out in 8- to 10-week-old mice injected s.c. with 1 × 10 6 Bin1−/− MR KEC cells or 1 × 105
B16-F10 melanoma cells. Treatment with either vehicle alone
or ethyl pyruvate or 2-AA in modified Ringer's solution (26)
injected i.p. at 40 mg/kg twice daily was initiated at day 7
following initial tumor cell engraftment. Tumor growth was
monitored by performing caliper measurements of orthogonal diameters, and the estimated tumor volume was calculated based on the formula for determining a prolapsed
elliptoid (d2 × l/0.52), where d is the shorter of the two orthogonal measurements. Graphing and statistical analysis
of the data was done using GraphPad Prism 4 software
(GraphPad Software).

Ethyl pyruvate inhibits IDO expression in vitro and
in vivo. Ethyl pyruvate is a stable aliphatic ester of pyruvate

p65 RelA subunit at Cys38 (27, 28). To evaluate the effects of
ethyl pyruvate on IDO expression, we employed U937 monocytic cells as a model system in which IDO is upregulated by
exposure to IFN-γ and LPS. Under assay conditions in which
the cells are maintained in medium supplemented with low
endogenous endotoxin serum, we found that LPS is required
in conjunction with IFN-γ to substantially induce IDO gene
expression and enzymatic activity that is otherwise marginally induced with either factor alone (Fig. 1A). At concentrations of ethyl pyruvate that interfere with NF-κB activity (27),
we found that ethyl pyruvate could suppress the level of kynurenine (the product of tryptophan catabolism by IDO) in
the medium by ∼90% after IFN-γ + LPS treatment (Fig. 1A).
This degree of IDO inhibition was comparable with that
achieved with the unrelated NF-κB inhibitory compound
QNZ (29) as well as with the pan-JAK inhibitory compound
DBI (30). In all three instances, the inhibition of IDO activity
by these compounds correlated with suppression of IDO1
protein expression (Fig. 1B). By way of comparison, these
compounds were at least as effective at inhibiting IDO activity as the bioactive, competitive inhibitor MTH-Trp (10),
which did not suppress the level of IDO1 protein expression
(Fig. 1).
Titration of ethyl pyruvate in this cell-based assay yielded
an EC50 of ∼2.2 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1), a value
consistent with previous studies of this agent as an NF-κB
inhibitor (27). When ethyl pyruvate was titrated against purified recombinant IDO1 enzyme in the same manner as in
the cell-based assay, no inhibitory activity was observed
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Western blot analysis of IFN-γ +
LPS–stimulated U937 cells showed that ethyl pyruvate acted
by blocking the induction of IDO1 protein expression within
the effective dose range (Supplementary Fig. S2). We confirmed the absence of cytotoxicity at the levels of ethyl pyruvate exposure evaluated in these studies by flow cytometric
analysis of propidium iodide–stained cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). A substantial increase in sub-G1 cells was observed
after IFN-γ + LPS stimulation, but this was not exacerbated
by exposure to ethyl pyruvate. Northern blot analysis revealed that the primary effect of ethyl pyruvate treatment
on IDO1 expression was to decrease the level of induced
message (Fig. 2). Following the removal of IFN-γ + LPS from
the culture medium, there was no demonstrable contribution
of newly synthesized message to the IDO1 mRNA pool as
shown by treatment with actinomycin D, and the level of
IDO1 mRNA declined precipitously past 4 h irrespective of
the presence or absence of ethyl pyruvate (Fig. 2A). As opposed to the lack of evidence for destabilization of IFN-γ +
LPS–induced IDO1 mRNA, evaluation of the effect of ethyl
pyruvate on IFN-γ + LPS–stimulated IDO1 promoter activity
in a transcriptional reporter assay supported the conclusion
that ethyl pyruvate interferes with new message synthesis
(Fig. 2B). Expression of the mutated inhibitor of NF-κBα
(IκBα) “superrepressor” protein (31), which interferes with
so-called “canonical” NF-κB signaling, had a comparable effect to that of ethyl pyruvate in suppressing IDO1 promoter
activity in this reporter assay (Fig. 2B), consistent with the
interpretation that ethyl pyruvate blocks IDO induction

with either IFN-γ or LPS alone were also evaluated as controls. The
kynurenine data are plotted as mean ± SD. For statistical comparisons,
each compound-treated IFN-γ + LPS–stimulated group was compared
with the IFN-γ + LPS–stimulated group not treated with compound using

through its ability to target p65 RelA, which is a major component of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway (22).
Lung has long been recognized as a tissue in which high
levels of IDO activity can be induced in response to exposure to bacterial LPS (32, 33). Based on these data, we have
developed a pharmacodynamic assay whereby IDO is induced in the lungs of mice in response to pulmonary exposure to LPS (34–37). In isolated lung tissue, the kynurenine
level, which is reflective of IDO activity, was elevated by ∼4fold at 24 h following LPS administration (Fig. 3). Mice with
a homozygous disruption of the Ido1 gene displayed a lower
baseline level of kynurenine in the lungs than did wild-type

<1.5-fold above baseline (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis
confirmed the expectation that the reduction in kynurenine
elevation by ethyl pyruvate correlated with the suppression
of Ido1 protein induction in lung tissue from ethyl pyruvate–treated animals (Fig. 3B). Taken together, our results
indicate that, at concentrations where it has been shown to
mediate anti-inflammatory effects, ethyl pyruvate inhibits
IDO expression in vitro and in vivo.
Ethyl pyruvate treatment suppresses tumor outgrowth.
Compounds that directly interfere with IDO-mediated tryptophan catalysis have shown antitumor activity. The ability
of ethyl pyruvate to block IDO activity by suppressing its
expression suggested that it might be capable of exerting
similar antitumor effects. We have tested this prediction in
two tumor models, Bin1−/− MR KECs and B16-F10 melanoma cells, both of which have been used previously to examine the antitumor activity IDO inhibitors (7, 10, 14, 38).
Our earlier work had identified IDO as a gene that is
dysregulated as a result of homozygous deletion of the
Bin1 tumor suppressor gene in MR KEC cells and had
shown that an IDO-dependent immune escape mechanism
renders these Bin1−/− MR KECs more aggressively tumorigenic in syngeneic, immunocompetent animals than their
wild-type counterparts (10). The Bin1−/− MR KEC cell line
also serves as a model in which IDO induction is NF-κB
dependent (10). Ectopic expression of the IκBα superrepressor

harvested at 0, 2, 4 8 10, and 16 h time points for Northern blot

this assay for assessing Ido1 enzyme activity (Fig. 3A). In

Figure 4. Ethyl pyruvate blocks NF-κB–dependent outgrowth of Bin1−/− MR KECs. A, two sublines of Bin1−/− MR KECs, one stably expressing the
IκB superrepressor mutant and the other expressing a vector-transfected control, were injected s.c. at 1 × 106 cells per mouse into C57BL/6 mice.
At 4 wk, weights of resected tumors were measured and plotted as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance between the two groups, denoted with an

with ethyl pyruvate or vehicle was initiated 7 d later. Ethyl pyruvate was administered i.p. at 40 mg/kg twice daily 5 days/wk until termination of the
experiment. Caliper measurements of tumors were recorded biweekly. Mean ± SE from these measurements is plotted for each group. At the conclusion
of the study, the difference in tumor volumes between treatment and nontreatment groups was assessed using a two-tailed Student's t test to
determine the indicated P value. Statistical significance, denoted with an asterisk, was determined at P < 0.05.

in Bin1−/− MR KECs effectively suppressed the ability of these
cells to form tumors (Fig. 4A), confirming the requirement for
NF-κB signaling to support IDO-dependent outgrowth in this
tumor model. Ethyl pyruvate treatment likewise suppressed
tumor growth when administered at the same dose level that
blocked IDO activity and expression in the pharmacodynamic
assay (Fig. 4B). Thus, as predicted, ethyl pyruvate treatment
can suppress the outgrowth of tumors in this model, and this
correlates with its ability to inhibit the NF-κB–dependent expression of IDO.
Because Bin1−/− MR KECs represent a rather specialized
tumor model, we extended these studies to evaluate ethyl pyruvate treatment in the widely used B16-F10 melanoma isograft tumor model. Unlike the Bin1−/− MR KECs, IDO is not
expressed detectably in B16-F10 tumor cells themselves but
rather has been found to be expressed in antigen-presenting
cells within the tumor-draining lymph nodes of the host animal (39). B16-F10 cells form highly aggressive, poorly immunogenic tumors that have been shown to be resistant to a
variety of immunotherapeutic strategies; however, direct inhibitors of the IDO enzyme can elicit robust single-agent responses in this model (14, 38). Comparing final mean tumor
volumes between ethyl pyruvate–treated and control animals
at the ∼4-week endpoint, we found that ethyl pyruvate treatment of B16-F10 challenged mice caused significant suppression of tumor growth (Fig. 5A), which equates to a T/C ratio
of 5.9% (a T/C ratio of <42% is indicative of efficacy according to standard National Cancer Institute criteria; ref. 40).

www.aacrjournals.org

This finding corroborates our observations made in the
Bin1−/− MR KEC model regarding the antitumor activity of
ethyl pyruvate.
To independently test the proposed biological basis for
ethyl pyruvate antitumor activity, we examined the effects
of a functional analogue, 2-AA, which has also been reported
to inhibit nuclear translocation and DNA binding by p65
RelA (28). Although appearing to be structurally dissimilar,
2-AA has been postulated to actually mimic the enol tautomer of ethyl pyruvate, which may represent the biologically
active form (28). In support of ethyl pyruvate and 2-AA having a shared mechanism of action, we found that 2-AA also
inhibited IDO expression in U937 cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, when administered to B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice,
2-AA suppressed tumor outgrowth as effectively as ethyl pyruvate (Fig. 5B). Thus, the key predictions that a distinct
compound sharing the NF-κB–dependent mechanism of action of ethyl pyruvate would both inhibit the induction of
IDO activity and suppress tumor growth were effectively
borne out.
T-cell immunity and IDO targeting are essential for
antitumor efficacy. As a therapeutic class, IDO enzyme inhibitors require intact T-cell function to suppress tumor
outgrowth in mice (7, 10, 14, 16, 38). Therefore, if the biological consequences of ethyl pyruvate treatment are primarily mediated through its ability to block IDO induction,
it should exhibit similar requirements as well. To evaluate the
importance of T-cell–dependent immunity to the antitumor

activity of ethyl pyruvate, athymic “nude” mice that are
deficient in mature T cells were challenged with B16F10 tumors. In the context of these mice, ethyl pyruvate
treatment had no discernible effect on tumor outgrowth
and tumor growth rate in both ethyl pyruvate untreated
and treated mice was somewhat accelerated relative to tumor growth rate in wild-type mice (Fig. 5C). Because IDO
is expressed only in normal host cells in the B16-F10
model and not the tumor cells themselves, Ido11-KO mice
were employed to genetically evaluate the direct relevance

1850

of Ido1 blockade to the mechanism of action of ethyl pyruvate. As predicted, ethyl pyruvate treatment was ineffective at suppressing the outgrowth of B16-F10 tumors in
Ido1-KO mice (Fig. 5D), although its antitumor efficacy
appears not to have been completely abolished as was observed previously with direct IDO inhibitors (14, 38).
These findings support the concept that ethyl pyruvate exerts its antitumor effects in a T-cell–dependent manner
primarily mediated through its ability to block the induction of IDO.

Cancer Immunotherapy with Ethyl Pyruvate

Discussion
The finding that ethyl pyruvate elicits IDO-directed, immune-based antitumor responses reinforces emerging concepts about the important role of inflammatory processes
in supporting cancer pathophysiology. Prompted by observations of Fink and colleagues in rodent models of ischemia/reperfusion injury, hemorrhagic shock and sepsis (26,
35, 41), ethyl pyruvate treatment has been investigated
for several years in a variety of animal models of acute
and chronic inflammatory disorders (17), while clinical testing thus far has been limited to the evaluation of ethyl pyruvate as an i.v. agent for the prevention of single- and
multiple-organ dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (42). Early studies of IDO have
noted its elevation in response to bacterial infections or
LPS exposure (32, 43). More recently, it has been reported
to be a mediator of endotoxic shock-associated lethality
(44). It is intriguing to speculate that diseases as seemingly
disparate as cancer and sepsis may be linked at some underlying level of pathophysiology through a shared dysregulation of IDO. In this light, the interaction of cancer cells
with the host may bear some similarity to unresolved infections that result in the clinical manifestations of sepsis.
Survival following the onset of severe sepsis as modeled in
the mouse can be dramatically improved by the administration of ethyl pyruvate (26), and it will be important to
assess whether this benefit is also linked to the ability of
ethyl pyruvate to inhibit IDO.
Many studies have suggested that correcting imbalances
in NF-κB signaling in cancer may have important benefits
in the context of both the tumor cell and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, but the concept of correcting
immune escape via this signaling pathway has received relatively little attention. Given the centrality of NF-κB as a
signal transduction node, the degree to which ethyl pyruvate antitumor activity was found to rely specifically on
IDO targeting in the host might be considered somewhat
surprising. However, this outcome aligns with a concept
we have termed “tolerance addiction,” proposed as a result
of previous studies of IDO inhibitory compounds (14, 38).
As noted previously, B16-F10 melanomas are illustrative of
a class of tumors that appear to preferentially use IDO as
an immune escape mechanism, such that, once a tumor is
established, continued IDO activity must be sustained to
maintain the immunoprivileged state of the tumor. In this
context, acute disruption of IDO activity, as with a pharmacologic agent, causes an immunologic unmasking that
promotes rejection. However, if upregulation of IDO activity is not an available option (as in the IDO-deficient
animal), alternate immune escape mechanisms can apparently be accessed by the developing tumor in which case
IDO-targeting compounds are ineffectual. The specific target of ethyl pyruvate, p65 RelA, is an important component
of canonical NF-κB signaling but plays no apparent role in
the noncanonical pathway (22). This specifically implicates
canonical NF-κB signaling as the regulatory pathway
controlling IDO expression, a conclusion that is further

www.aacrjournals.org

supported by the demonstration that the IκBα superrepressor, which also selectively interferes with canonical
NF-κB signaling, also effectively suppresses induction of
IDO promoter activity. These results appear to counter
the evidence that noncanonical NF-κB signaling is important for IDO induction mediated through GITR signaling
(45). Our data do not, however, necessarily contradict
these findings but rather indicate that the regulation of
IDO expression is likely to be complex and that the relative importance of canonical versus noncanonical NF-κB
signaling in controlling this process may be contextual.
Although our findings are consistent with published evidence of ethyl pyruvate as a NF-κB inhibitor, they do not rule
out alternative mechanisms that may be germane to its
in vivo effects. Ethyl pyruvate has also been reported to exert
anti-inflammatory effects through ROS scavenging (46) and
through blocking HMGB1 release (26), and it is not inconceivable that elevated ROS or HMGB1 release may support
dysregulated expression of IDO. One group has recently reported that ethyl pyruvate can exert antitumor activity in a
liver metastasis model and has suggested that ethyl pyruvate
may produce anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects responsible for its antitumor activity though mechanistic validation was lacking (47). From our studies it is clear that
direct cytotoxicity is not sufficient to account for the antitumor efficacy of ethyl pyruvate against B16-F10 tumors in vivo,
as no evidence of antitumor activity was observed when this
compound was administered to athymic, tumor-bearing
mice. Furthermore, it is clear from the loss of ethyl pyruvate
efficacy in Ido1-deficient mice that the relevant regulatory
pathway targeted by ethyl pyruvate directs an immune escape mechanism that is predominantly orchestrated through
the elevation of IDO activity.
While direct inhibition of the IDO enzyme is presently
being explored by many groups as an interventional approach, ethyl pyruvate may offer an alternative, low-cost,
readily accessible tool to indirectly block IDO for therapeutic purposes. It is likely that IDO inhibitors will prove most
effective when combined with other cancer treatment modalities (7, 10, 11), and ethyl pyruvate, as a safe and inexpensive food additive, could readily be evaluated as an
adjuvant to standard-of-care treatments with minimal risk
of adverse side effects. Given accumulating evidence that
elevated IDO activity may have a pathophysiologic role
in other diseases such as chronic infections and autoimmune disorders (25, 48), ethyl pyruvate may find other
clinical applications as an IDO inhibitory strategy as well.
Fink and colleagues have described a simple formulation
to administer ethyl pyruvate (49) by substituting it for lactate in Ringer's lactate solution that is usually given i.v. for
fluid resuscitation after blood loss or as a conduit for drug
delivery. Insofar as IDO inhibitors have been shown to cooperate with different types of cancer therapy in mouse
tumor models, we suggest the same Ringer's formulation
as a route to administer ethyl pyruvate with standard
i.v. chemotherapeutics. Repositioning ethyl pyruvate for
an oncology study in this manner would be a straightforward strategy to clinically evaluate the potential of ethyl
