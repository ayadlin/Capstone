Abstract
FAS (APO-1/CD95) and its physiological ligand, FASL, regulate apoptotic death of unwanted or
dangerous cells in many tissues, functioning as a guardian against autoimmunity and cancer
development1-4. Distinct cell types differ in the mechanisms by which the ‘death receptor’ FAS
triggers their apoptosis1-4. In type I cells, such as lymphocytes, activation of ‘effector caspases’ by
FAS-induced activation of caspase-8 suffices for cell killing whereas in type II cells, including
hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells, amplification of the caspase cascade through caspase-8
mediated activation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BID5 is essential6-8. Here we
show, that loss of X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)9,10 function by genetargeting or treatment with a second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC11, also
called DIABLO12: direct IAP binding protein with low pI) mimetic drug rendered hepatocytes
independent of BID for FAS-induced apoptosis signalling. These results show that XIAP is the
critical discriminator between type I versus type II apoptosis signalling and suggest that IAP
inhibitors should be used with caution in cancer patients with underlying liver conditions.

Hepatocytes are highly sensitive to FASL13 or agonistic antibodies14 and, based on the upregulation of FAS on hepatocytes and invasion of FASL-expressing cytotoxic T
lymphocytes or NK cells into hepatic sinusoids, FAS-induced apoptosis has been implicated
as a cause of a variety of acute and chronic liver diseases, such as viral, drug or alcohol
induced hepatitis15. Caspase-816 and its activator FADD/MORT117 are required for FASinduced apoptosis in all cell types studied so far. Although initial studies with cell lines
produced conflicting results13,18, it is now clear that amplification of apoptosis signalling

through caspase-8-mediated proteolytic activation of the BH3-only protein BID leading to
BAX/BAK-dependent activation of caspase-9 and effector caspases is essential in
hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells (type II cells) but dispensable in lymphocytes (type I
cells; Supplementary Fig. 1)6-8.

It is unclear why FAS activates such substantially different apoptotic pathways in different
cell types, but it has been postulated that this may be due to differences in the extent of FAS
aggregation or internalisation, extent of caspase cascade activation, levels of caspase
inhibitors (XIAP) and/or abundance of caspase substrates that need to be proteolysed for
cells to die4,18-20. To begin to explore the differences between type I and type II cells, we
compared the levels and activation status of apoptosis regulators and the processing of
critical caspase substrates between characteristic type I cells, thymocytes, and type II cells,
hepatocytes, after FAS stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). Processing of caspase-8 into
its cleaved form (p18) could be detected as early as 15 min after FAS stimulation by
immunoblotting or pull-down of the active enzyme with biotinylated X-VAD-fmk (a
compound that binds efficiently to active caspases) followed by immunoblotting with a
caspase-8-specific antibody (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Caspase-8-mediated
proteolysis of BID and activation of caspase-3 and -7 became evident by ~15 min and ~60
min, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Apoptosis induction was equivalent between
WT thymocytes and hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). As reported7, FASL elicited a
similar extent of apoptosis in WT and Bid-/- thymocytes, regardless of whether they were
kept in single-cell suspension cultures or fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC; Supplementary
Fig. 2a, c). BID-deficient thymocytes and hepatocytes exhibited normal levels of early
caspase-8 activation, but BID-deficient hepatocytes showed considerably less caspase-9
activation and a complete lack of effector caspase activation compared to their WT
counterparts or thymocytes from WT as well as BID-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a,
b). The levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1 as well as the pro-apoptotic
SMAC/DIABLO were similar between thymocytes and hepatocytes and remained largely
unchanged during FAS activation (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2d, e).

Interestingly, however, despite the fact that the basal levels of XIAP were comparable
between both cell types, we found that in thymocytes treatment with FASL resulted in rapid
loss of XIAP that paralleled cell death (Fig. 1b). Addition of the broad-spectrum caspase
inhibitor QVD-oph blocked apoptosis and prevented disappearance of XIAP in FASLtreated thymocytes (Supplementary Fig. 3a), whereas inhibition of the proteasome had no
impact on XIAP levels (Supplementary Fig. 3b). In striking contrast, in hepatocytes
treatment with FASL resulted in an increase in XIAP protein levels over the first three
hours, despite efficient initiation of apoptosis (Fig. 1b). The FASL treatment-induced
increase in XIAP could be blocked by addition of QVD-oph or BID-deficiency, which
prevents effector caspase activation (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Immunoprecipitation with
antibodies to XIAP showed that treatment with FASL caused an increase in the amount of
processed caspase-3 associated with its inhibitor XIAP in hepatocytes (Fig. 1c), indicating
that XIAP is stabilised by binding and inhibiting proteolytically activated effector caspases.
Furthermore, substantial differences in cleavage of the proto-typical effector caspase
substrate ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, CAD)21,22 were detected between
thymocytes and hepatocytes. Cleaved fragments of ICAD appeared after 60 min of FASL
treatment in thymocytes from WT and Bid-/- animals. Notably, in WT hepatocytes ICAD
processing was considerably less efficient compared to WT or Bid-/- thymocytes and in BIDdeficient livers no ICAD cleavage could be detected (Fig. 1d, e). Accordingly, fluorogenic
(DEVDase) assays showed that FASL-treated WT and Bid-/- thymocytes had ~6-fold higher
levels of overall effector caspase activity compared to WT hepatocytes and no such
enzymatic activity was detected in hepatocytes from FASL-injected Bid-/- mice (Fig. 1f).
These results indicate that the ratio between proteolytically activated effector caspases, the

caspase inhibitor XIAP and the caspase substrates that need to be proteolysed may
determine whether cells undergo type I or type II FAS-induced apoptosis.

Therefore and because XIAP is a potent inhibitor of caspase-9 and effector caspases9,10 and
because XIAP over-expression delayed FAS-induced apoptosis in mouse thymocytes23, we
explored the role of XIAP in FASL- (Fig. 2) and anti-FAS antibody-induced (not shown)
hepatocyte killing in vivo. As reported13,14, WT mice succumbed to these treatments within
2.5-3 h (FASL, Fig. 2a) or 3-4 h (anti-FAS antibody), respectively. Interestingly, all XIAPdeficient mice died considerably earlier (within 1-2 h for FASL; Fig. 2a and within 2 h for
anti-FAS antibody), presenting with elevated serum levels of the liver associated
transaminases ALT and AST (Fig. 2b) and severe liver damage (Fig. 2g, h). Thus, XIAP is a
critical attenuator of FAS-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. In contrast, loss of XIAP did not
increase FAS-mediated apoptosis in thymocytes (type I cells; data not shown and24).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine whether XIAP is the crucial discriminator between type I versus type II FASinduced apoptosis signalling, we generated BID/XIAP double-deficient mice, which proved
to be fertile and presented with no obvious abnormalities under unstressed conditions. As
previously reported6,7, BID-deficient mice survived injection with FASL or anti-FAS
antibody without developing signs of illness and showed no abnormal increase in serum
ALT or AST levels or disruption of liver architecture (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4a). In
contrast, all BID/XIAP double-deficient animals succumbed to this treatment (albeit slightly
later than WT mice; ~3-3.5 h vs 2.5-3 h), presenting with elevated liver enzyme levels in
their sera and severe liver damage (Fig. 2a, b, g, h and Supplementary Fig. 4a).
Immunoblotting demonstrated that FAS stimulation caused similar levels of caspase-8
processing in livers of mice of all genotypes, but caspase-9 and effector caspases were only
substantially activated in livers of the sensitive animals (WT, Xiap-/- and Bid-/-Xiap-/-) but
not in livers from the resistant Bid-/- mice (Fig. 2c). This was confirmed by pull-down of
active caspases -8, -9, -3 and -7 with biotinylated X-VAD-fmk followed by immunoblotting
with caspase-specific antibodies (Fig. 2d, e) and by fluorogenic effector caspase activity
(DEVDase) assays (Fig. 2f). The hepatocytes in the FASL- or anti-FAS antibody-injected
Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice exhibited severe disruption of liver architecture (Fig. 2g) and classical
signs of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and DNA cleavage, the latter revealed
by TUNEL staining (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4a).
In accordance with our analyses of hepatocytes, pancreatic β-cells, which also undergo type
II Fas-induced apoptosis signalling8, deficient for BID were resistant to FASL, but
concomitant loss of XIAP (in Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice) restored sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Remarkably, pre-treatment with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor QVD-oph
significantly (p=0.0042) protected Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice from FASL-induced fatal hepatitis and
these animals contained lower ALT (p=0.078) and AST (p=0.024) levels in their sera and
less hepatocyte destruction compared to Bid-/-Xiap-/- animals that had only been treated with
FASL (Fig. 3a-d and Supplementary Fig. 4b). As expected, pre-treatment with QVD-oph
inhibited FASL-induced processing of caspase-8 and subsequent proteolytic activation of
BID and caspases -3, -7 and -9 (Fig. 3e). Although QVD-oph was not able to rescue all
Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice from FASL-induced fatal hepatitis (presumably because the inhibitor
could not completely block caspase activation long-term), these results show that FAS
stimulation kills BID/XIAP double-deficient hepatocytes through caspase-dependent
apoptosis and not through some caspase-independent process. Thus, XIAP functions as the
critical regulator that discriminates between type I versus type II FAS-induced apoptosis
signalling.

An important question is whether cytochrome c/APAF-1 mediated activation of caspase-9 is
necessary for type II FAS-induced apoptosis, or whether the release of IAP antagonists (e.g.
SMAC/DIABLO) from mitochondria and their effect on XIAP, leading to the release of
active effector caspases, is sufficient. Notably, apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 2h) and caspase -3 and
-7 activation (Fig. 2c, d) were detectable in livers from Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice 120 min after
FASL injection, although at that time the cleaved form of caspase-9 was observed at lower
levels in Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 2c). The caspase-9 processing seen
in Bid-/-Xiap-/- hepatocytes (Fig. 2c) might thus be a consequence of cleavage of procaspase-9 by already activated effector caspases, indicating that caspase-9 may not be
necessary for effector caspase activation in FAS-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. Consistent
with this hypothesis, gene-targeted mice harbouring a mutation in cytochrome c that allows
respiration but prevents apoptosome formation (and hence caspase-9 activation), were found
to be normally sensitive to FAS-induced hepatocyte killing25, whereas combined loss of
caspases-3 and -7 rendered cells resistant to FASL26.

XIAP and related IAPs (cIAP1/2) are negatively regulated by SMAC/DIABLO11,12 and
OMI/HTRA2 proteins that are released from the mitochondria during apoptosis9,10. SMAC/
DIABLO mimetics are currently in development for cancer therapy and were shown to kill
tumour cells (at least in part) by enhancing autocrine TNF>TNF-R1 signalling27-30. We
examined the impact of the IAP inhibitor BV627 on FASL-induced hepatocyte killing and
hepatitis. WT mice injected with BV6 plus FASL died significantly earlier than WT mice
treated with FASL alone, presenting with elevated serum levels of ALT and AST similar to
Xiap-/- mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). Remarkably, all Bid-/- mice injected with FASL plus
BV6 rapidly developed fatal hepatitis (Fig. 4a), presenting with abnormally increased serum
ALT and AST levels (Fig. 4b) and extensive hepatocyte destruction (Fig. 4c, d and
Supplementary Fig. 4c), whereas all Bid-/- mice injected with FASL alone or BV6 alone
remained healthy. In agreement with the observed morbidity and liver damage, and despite
initial activation of caspase-8 in all FASL-treated mice, significant activation of effector
caspases -3 and -7 was only seen in Bid-/- mice that were injected with both FASL and BV6
but not in those treated with FASL or BV6 alone (Fig. 4e and data not shown). Importantly,
pre-treatment with QVD-oph protected Bid-/- mice from FASL plus BV6 induced fatal
hepatitis (Fig. 4a) and, accordingly, reduced serum levels of ALT and AST to those seen in
animals treated with FASL alone (Fig. 4b). Moreover, histological examination and TUNEL
staining revealed normal liver architecture and only few apoptotic hepatocytes in FASL plus
BV6 plus QVD-oph treated animals (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 4c). This
demonstrates that the combination of FASL plus BV6 triggers classical, caspase-dependent
hepatocyte apoptosis in Bid-/- mice. It could be argued that BV6 treatment may promote
FASL induced hepatocyte killing by blocking cIAP1 and/or cIAP, which would be expected
to require autocrine/paracrine TNFα>TNF-Rl signalling27-30. ELISA showed, however, that
treatment with FASL, BV6 or both had no impact on the levels of TNFα in the livers of
mice (Supplementary Figs. 6c and 7c). Pertinently, TNFα neutralising antibodies had no
impact on FASL plus BV6 induced hepatocyte killing in Bid-/- mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a,
b) although they could abrogate TNFα-induced killing of L929 cells in culture
(Supplementary Fig. 8a) and prevent lipopolysacchride plus galactosamine (LPS+Ga1N)
induced fatal hepatitis in mice (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c), a process dependent of
TNFα>TNF-Rl signalling7. These results demonstrate that BV6 does not need to activate
TNF>TNF-R1 signalling to promote FASL induced hepatocyte killing, but functions by
blocking the anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP. The notion that XIAP rather than cIAP1/cIAP2
is the critical target of BV6 in FAS-induced hepatocyte apoptosis is underscored by the
finding that only Xiap-/- mice (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figure 6a), but not mice lacking
cIAP1, cIAP2, or both in their livers succumbed more rapidly to FASL induced hepatitis
than WT animals (not shown). The critical role of XIAP in regulating FAS-induced
apoptosis predicts that endogenous IAP antagonists, such as SMAC/DIABLO or OMI/

HTRA2, play critical roles in this process. Since Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice succumb to FASLinduced hepatitis more slowly than WT controls, apoptosis inhibitors in addition to XIAP,
such as ML-IAP10, may contribute to the regulation of this process. Finally, while IAP
inhibition represents a promising new strategy for the treatment of cancer, our data indicate
that IAP inhibitors should be used with caution in cancer patients in combination with liver
toxic chemotherapy or with underlying liver conditions, particularly those associated with
significant infiltration of intra-hepatic FASL-producing cells.

METHODS SUMMARY
FASL-induced hepatitis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 0.25 mg/kg body weight recombinant soluble
FASL (FLAG® tagged FASL, Alexis) that had been crosslinked with 2 μg anti-FLAG®
antibody (M2, SIGMA) per μg of FASL. The pancaspase inhibitor QVD-oph (MP
Biomedicals) was injected at a concentration of 20 mg/kg body weight i.p. 30 min prior to
treatment with FASL. Pre-treatment with the SMAC/DIABLO mimetic compound BV6 (a
kind gift from Genentech) was performed by i.p. injection at a concentration of 10 mg/kg
body weight 30 min prior to injection of FASL. BV6 was dissolved in freshly prepared,
sterile-filtered (0.2 μM membrane) 15% hydroxy-propyl-β-cyclodextrin in 20 mM succinic
acid (pH 5.5). Mice were sacrificed at various time points, bled for serum analysis of the
liver-associated transaminases ALT and AST and the livers removed for biochemical and
histological analysis. Statistical analyses were performed applying a two-tailed unpaired t
test. Statistical analysis of animal survival was performed using a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
test.

Figure 2. Loss of XIAP re-sensitises BID-deficient mice to FASL-induced fatal hepatitis

a, Long-term survival of WT, Xiap-/-, Bid-/- and Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice injected i.v. with 0.25 mg/
kg FLAG-tagged FASL crosslinked with anti-FLAG antibody (2 μg/μg of FASL) is shown,
p (WT vs Bid-/-)<0.0003; p (Bid-/- vs Bid-/-Xiap-/-)= 0.0005; p (WT vs Bid-/-Xiap-/-)=0.1133.
b, Serum levels of ALT and AST after 120 min of FASL treatment (100 min for Xiap-/mice) were quantified in mice of the indicated genotypes. The horizontal bars indicate the
mean; n: numbers of mice analysed. P values are indicated below graphs. c, Processing of
caspases -3, -7, -8, -9, BID (truncated tBID panel exposed longer), MCL-1 and β-actin
(loading control) in livers of the mice treated as described in a was examined by

animals per genotype and time point of treatment. d, Activation of caspases -3 and -7 in
livers of WT, Xiap-/-, Bid-/- and Bid-/-Xiap-/- mice treated as described in a and sacrificed at
120 min (100 min for Xiap-/- mice) was examined by pulldown with the caspase inhibitor
biotin-X-VAD-fmk followed by detection by immunoblotting using caspase-specific
antibodies. e, Activation of caspases -3, -7, -8 and -9 in liver extracts from WT or Bid-/mice treated as described in a and sacrificed at the indicated time points, was examined as
described in d. Asterix indicates a cross-reactive band. f, Fluorogenic measurement of the
enzymatic activity of effector caspases (DEVDase activity) in the livers of the mice of the
indicated genotypes treated as described in a. Four independent measurements of two
individual mice per genotype and time point of treatment are shown. Data represent means
+/-SEM. g, Histological analysis (H&E staining) of liver sections from animals of the
indicated genotypes treated as described in a sacrificed after 120 min of FASL treatment
(100 min for Xiap-/- mice) and untreated control animals. h, TUNEL staining of liver
sections from the animals described in f. Images are representative of a least 3 mice per
genotype and time point of treatment. Scale bar = 50 μm.
