ABSTRACT:
TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, but in some cases
they fail to respond to this ligand. We explored the ability of representative
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 Kinase)/mTOR and HSP90 inhibitors to overcome
TRAIL resistance by increasing apoptosis in colorectal cancer models. We determined
the sensitivity of 27 human colorectal cancer and 2 non-transformed colon epithelial
cell lines to TRAIL treatment. A subset of the cancer cell lines with a range of responses
to TRAIL was selected from the panel for treatment with TRAIL combined with the PI3
Kinase/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 or the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG (tanespimycin). Two
TRAIL-resistant cell lines were selected for in vivo combination studies with TRAIL
and 17-AAG. We found that 13 colorectal cancer cell lines and the 2 non-transformed
colon epithelial cell lines were resistant to TRAIL. We demonstrated that co-treatment
of TRAIL and PI-103 or 17-AAG was synergistic or additive and significantly enhanced
apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. This was associated with decreased expression
or activity of survival protein biomarkers such as ERBB2, AKT, IKKα and XIAP. In
contrast, the effect of the combination treatments in non-transformed colon cells was
minimal. We show here for the first time that co-treatment in vivo with TRAIL and
17-AAG in two TRAIL-resistant human colorectal cancer xenograft models resulted
in significantly greater tumor growth inhibition compared to single treatments.
We propose that combining TRAIL with PI3 Kinase/mTOR or HSP90 inhibitors has
therapeutic potential in the treatment of TRAIL-resistant colorectal cancers.

INTRODUCTION

for those patients who can tolerate the chemotherapy
regimen [3]. In addition to cytotoxic chemotherapy,
some agents targeted against specific molecular pathways
have been evaluated in colorectal cancer and it has been
demonstrated that treatment with these drugs alone or
in combination with standard chemotherapy can result
in a significant survival advantage, e.g. cetuximab as
a monotherapy or in combination with irinotecan or

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer
in UK and the second leading cause of cancer-related
death in US, with around 40,000 and 140,000 new cases
registered each year respectively [1,2]. The current
standard treatment for patients with colorectal cancer is
surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy

oxaliplatin [3-5].
Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process through
which cells are programmed to die: there are two types
of apoptosis, regulated by the intrinsic and the extrinsic
pathways [6]. TRAIL (TNF related apoptosis inducing
ligand) induces apoptosis through an extrinsic pathway
by binding to the death receptors DR4 and DR5. The
ligand-bound receptors interact with the adaptor protein
FADD (Fas (TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain) and
caspase 8 forming the DISC (Death–Inducing Signalling
Complex) that directly activates terminal caspases such
as caspase 3 [7]. At this stage caspase 8 cleavage and
activation can be inhibited by the recruitment of FLIP
(FLICE-inhibitory protein) within the DISC [8-10].
It has been demonstrated that TRAIL can
specifically target tumor cells, inducing apoptosis without
affecting normal tissues that are generally resistant to the
ligand [11]. Recombinant TRAIL or high-affinity agonist
monoclonal antibodies against TRAIL death-receptors
are now in Phase I/II clinical trials [12-15]. However,
despite the potential therapeutic specificity for cancer
cells, intrinsic resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis has
been identified as a current challenge [15,16]. This TRAIL
resistance can be due to downstream molecules involved
in apoptosis such as FLIP, BAD or BAX [8,17]. Finally,
TRAIL can also activate survival pathways regulated by
PI3 Kinase and NFκ-B leading to a pro-survival effect
via a mechanism that is not yet fully defined [18,19].
Therefore, the use of therapies that combine TRAIL or
TRAIL receptor agonist antibodies together with drugs
that target potential mechanisms of TRAIL-resistance
represents a very attractive strategy for cancer treatment.
PI3 Kinase and HSP90 are key proteins and drug
targets with a major role in the control of cell survival,
cell growth and apoptosis by modulating the activity of
a number of pathways [20-27]. The PI3 Kinase pathway
is frequently deregulated in cancer and signaling
downstream of PI3 Kinase involves proteins such as AKT,
PDK and mTOR that control multiple cellular mechanisms
[21, 22]. HSP90 is a chaperone protein responsible
for the correct folding, stability and activation of client
proteins. It plays a fundamental cellular role in normal
and stress conditions as well as in pathological states such
as cancer [24-27]. Inhibiting HSP90 leads to the loss of
activity and degradation of client proteins, among which
are key components of the PI3 Kinase signaling pathway
that include ERBB2, AKT and IKKα [24-28]. IKK
(Inhibitor κB Kinase) is the major activator of NFκ-B
which is responsible for transcription of c-IAPs and
XIAP (Inhibitors of Apoptosis) that directly block caspase
activation [29].
Stimulated by the important roles of PI3 Kinase and
HSP90 chaperone pathways in cancer and the potential
for selectivity based on the dependence of cancer cells
on these pathways, inhibitors of both pathways have
been identified and are now undergoing clinical trials
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[21-27]. Several HSP90 inhibitors have been developed;
among these is the potent derivative of the natural product
geldanamycin 17-AAG (tanespimycin) which was the
first HSP90 inhibitor to enter clinical trials [24-27]. It has
been demonstrated previously that inhibition of HSP90
by geldanamycin or 17-AAG can sensitize some cancer
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in vitro [30-32]. PI103 is a prototype PI3 Kinase inhibitor that potently and
selectively targets class I PI3 Kinases and mTOR [33,34].
Previous studies have suggested that signaling through PI3
Kinase can prevent TRAIL-induced apoptosis in different
cancer cell types [35,36]; however, these studies were
limited to using LY294002, an early PI3 Kinase inhibitor
that has weak potency and off-target activity on protein
kinases such as casein kinase 2 [37]. It has been reported
that PI-103 increases the effect of TRAIL in glioma [38]
and neuroblastoma models [39]. Based on these data,
we hypothesized that inhibitors of PI3 Kinase/mTOR or
HSP90 could enhance sensitivity to TRAIL in TRAILresistant colorectal cancer cells by modulating survival
signaling.
Here, our aims were to explore the ability of
representative, specific PI3 Kinase/mTOR or HSP90
inhibitors to reverse resistance to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in human colorectal cancer. We demonstrate
that combinations of TRAIL and PI-103 or 17-AAG were
synergistic or additive and induced increased apoptosis
in TRAIL-resistant human colorectal cancer cells with
the simultaneous inhibition of the activity or expression
of ERBB2, AKT, IKKα and XIAP. In contrast, this effect
was minimal in non-transformed CO841 human colon
epithelial cells, indicating the potential for differential
therapeutic selectivity. We also demonstrate here, to our
knowledge for the first time, the promising in vivo efficacy
of combinatorial treatment with TRAIL and 17-AAG in
two TRAIL-resistant human colorectal tumor xenograft
models. Associated biomarker changes were consistent
with the proposed mechanism of reduced survival
signaling. Our results indicate the therapeutic potential
of combinatorial therapy with PI3 Kinase/mTOR or
HSP90 inhibitors in colorectal cancer and suggest useful
mechanism-based pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

RESULTS
TRAIL SENSITIVITY IN A PANEL OF
HUMAN COLORECTAL CANCER AND NONTRANSFORMED CELL LINES
A panel of 27 human colorectal cancer and 2
non-transformed human colon epithelial cell lines were
screened for TRAIL sensitivity by determining GI50 values
at 96h using the SRB assay. Of the 29 lines, 14 responded
to TRAIL treatment with GI50 values ranging from 4.6
1186

to 139 ng/ml. A GI50 could not be determined for the
remaining resistant cells even at the highest concentration
of 250 ng/ml TRAIL (Fig. 1). TRAIL sensitivity was not
related to the presence of activating oncogenic KRAS,
BRAF and PIK3CA mutations common to colorectal
cancer (Fig. 1).
The interaction between TRAIL and its receptors is
the first step triggering apoptosis and TRAIL sensitivity
may be influenced by the level of expression of these
receptors on the cell surface [40]. Therefore, DR4 and
DR5 TRAIL receptor expression was analyzed by flow
cytometry in a subset of 7 colorectal cancer lines and the
non-transformed CO841 cells. There was no correlation
between expression of TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 on
the cell surface and resistance to TRAIL (Fig. 2). With
one exception, all tumor cell lines analyzed exhibited
cell surface expression of DR4 and DR5, irrespective of
sensitivity to TRAIL. The exception was the SW620 tumor
cell line that expressed DR5, but not DR4, a pattern similar
to the non-transformed CO841 cells (Fig. 2). HCT116,
LoVo (both sensitive) and RKO (resistant) tumor cells
were also analyzed for the expression of decoy receptors

DcR1 and DcR2. All the three lines expressed detectable
DcR2 and lower levels of DcR1 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein), a negative
regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, is considered as
one of the key proteins responsible for TRAIL resistance
[41]. Cells were therefore analyzed for FLIP protein
expression by immunoblot, but no differences were found
among a selection of 7 tumor cell lines with different
degrees of sensitivity to TRAIL (Supplemetary Fig. 2A).
In addition, inhibition of FLIP expression by siRNA in
one of these tumor cell lines, RKO, did not reverse the
resistance to TRAIL, as assessed by cell number or PARP
cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 2B-E). This suggested that
elevated basal expression of FLIP protein in the TRAILresistant cells compared to the TRAIL-sensitive cells
was unlikely to be a cause of resistance, at least for the 5
TRAIL-resistant lines tested here.

ng/ml), SW620 (resistant, GI50 > 250 ng/ml) colorectal
cancer and CO841 normal colon epithelium (resistant, GI50
> 250 ng/ml) cell lines were selected for further analysis
as representative models to explore the mechanism of
TRAIL resistance in colon cancer.
During TRAIL treatment we observed that resistant
tumor cell lines, such as RKO, responded to the apoptotic
stimulus at early stages of TRAIL treatment, but at later
times of exposure (24h and later) the apoptotic response
defined by PARP cleavage was lost, despite continued
exposure to TRAIL (Fig. 3).
TRAIL-sensitive HCT116 tumor cells were analyzed
after TRAIL treatment (5 ng/ml) and images were taken at
2, 4, 8 and 24h post treatment. Apoptosis was observed
as early as 2h post-treatment and by 24h essentially all
cells had died; cleavage of PARP continued to increase
throughout the time-course up to 24h (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Surprisingly, apoptosis was observed at 2, 4 and
8h following treatment of resistant RKO tumor cells
with a high concentration of TRAIL (200 ng/ml) (Fig.

3A); however, at 24h, even after the addition of fresh
TRAIL, cells showed far less apoptosis. Immunoblotting
for cleaved PARP content confirmed the induction of
apoptosis at 2-12h (Fig. 3 B, left), but at 24h, again even
after adding fresh TRAIL, the cells no longer exhibited
PARP cleavage.
Next, we tested the potential persistence of the
acquired loss of apoptosis. After 24h exposure to TRAIL,
RKO cells were washed and left in TRAIL-free culture
media for 4 days before retreatment with TRAIL following
the same time course described above. The cells exhibited
the same apoptotic response to the high concentration of
TRAIL for up to 8-12h, but as before showed no cleavage
of PARP at 24h, even when fresh TRAIL was added for
a further 4h (Fig. 3B, right). Song and colleagues have
reported a similar effect in human TRAIL-resistant
prostate adenocarcinoma cells [17].
Our data demonstrated that TRAIL-resistant
RKO colorectal cancer cells were able to activate the
apoptotic pathway after TRAIL treatment, albeit at high

concentrations, but became insensitive beyond 12h
exposure to the ligand. We observed the same effect in
other TRAIL-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines such
as HT29 and COLO320 (data not shown). Importantly,
the PARP cleavage observed in RKO and HCT116 tumor
cells was not observed in non-transformed CO841 colon
epithelial cells, suggesting that the non-tumorigenic cells
have a mechanism of resistance to TRAIL that is likely to
be different from the TRAIL-resistant colorectal cancer
cell lines (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. 4).

HT29 colorectal cancer cell lines. CIs (Combination
index) were calculated in HCT116 cells for PI-103 or 17AAG plus TRAIL and in HT29 cells for GDC-0941 or 17AAG plus TRAIL. The analysis demonstrated synergism
in both HCT116 and HT29 tumor cells for the combination
of PI3 Kinase inhibitors and TRAIL, while additivity was
observed in both cell lines for 17-AAG in combination
with TRAIL (Fig. 4A). Importantly, in TRAIL-resistant
RKO tumor cells, the addition of either of the inhibitors,
but particularly 17-AAG, markedly sensitized the response
to TRAIL in a concentration-dependent manner, with both
co-treatments exhibiting a synergistic response (Fig. 4B).
Apoptosis quantification was carried out in RKO,
HCT116 and CO841 cells by flow cytometry analysis
using FITC-Annexin V after treatment at 2.5 x GI50 PI103 or 17-AAG and 200 ng/ml TRAIL. Significantly
increased apoptosis (p<0.05) was detected in TRAILresistant RKO colorectal cancer cells treated for 24h with
TRAIL plus PI-103 or 17-AAG as compared to single
treatments (Fig. 4C). Enhanced apoptosis was also seen
in TRAIL-sensitive HCT116 colorectal tumor cells,
although in these cells TRAIL alone at the concentration
of 2.5xGI50 induced apoptosis in more than 50% of the
cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast to the cancer
cell lines, the non-transformed TRAIL-resistant CO841

OVERCOMING TRAIL RESISTANCE WITH
PI-103 OR 17-AAG
Colorectal cancer cells were treated with TRAIL
alone or in combination with the representative PI3
Kinase/mTOR inhibitor, PI-103 or the representative
HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG. HT29 cells are resistant to
PI-103, most likely through rapid glucuronidation to an
inactive metabolite [33], and so were treated with an
alternative, more metabolically stable PI3 Kinase inhibitor
GDC-0941 that is currently undergoing clinical trial
[42,43].
Combination treatments were performed in TRAILsensitive HCT116 and TRAIL-intermediately sensitive

colon epithelial cells failed to show a significant increase
in apoptosis for either single or combination treatments
(Fig. 4D). These results support the proposed hypothesis
that the synergistic responses seen in colorectal cancer
cells with the combination treatments are associated
with increased apoptosis, and indicate a potential for
therapeutic selectivity between cancer and normal cells.

RKO and SW620 tumor cell lines and non-transformed
CO841 cells were treated for 24h with 17-AAG or PI-103
plus TRAIL. In addition to determining PARP cleavage
following caspase activation, we also measured the
decrease in pro-caspase 3, 8 and 9 levels that indicates
activation of the proteolytoic caspase cascade. Cotreatment with TRAIL plus 17-AAG or PI-103 generally
induced a decrease in the levels of pro-caspases compared
to individual treatments in HT29 tumor cells and the
TRAIL-resistant RKO and SW620 colorectal cancer
cells (Fig. 5A) as well as HCT116 TRAIL-sensitive cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6). In non-transformed TRAILresistant CO841 colon cells, only weak reduction of procaspase 8 was observed and only for the co-treatment with
17-AAG (Fig. 5A). The non-transformed CO841 cells also
showed no or weak cleavage of caspase 3 when treated

with 17-AAG or 17-AAG and TRAIL.
In association with decreased pro-caspase levels,
we observed an increase in the cleaved form of PARP
following co-treatment of colorectal cancer cells with 17AAG or PI-103 and TRAIL as compared to single agent
treatments (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. 6). In contrast,
much weaker PARP cleavage was seen in non-transformed
CO841 cells co-treated with 17-AAG and TRAIL.
Since a significant increase in colorectal cancer cell
apoptosis was observed after combination treatments,
we further investigated the status of molecules involved
in regulating the apoptotic program and surviving/cell
growth pathways. We focused on IKKα, c-IAP1 and
XIAP, ERBB2 and AKT as they are key regulators of cell
survival that are mechanistically linked to the PI3 Kinase
and HSP90 pathways. Both PI-103 and 17-AAG when
combined with TRAIL caused a decrease in the levels of
IKKα and its phosphorylated form in TRAIL-resistant
RKO cancer cells; expression of the caspase inhibitor
protein XIAP was also decreased following both cotreatments (Fig. 5B). In addition, the 17-AAG plus TRAIL
co-treatment resulted in a modest decrease in levels of the
caspase inhibitor c-IAP1.
PI-103 and 17-AAG both decreased AKTSer473
phosphorylation when used as single agents in RKO
tumor cells; moreover, when combined with TRAIL
they prevented the increase in phospho-AKT caused
by the ligand alone (Fig. 5B). This effect of TRAIL on
AKT phosphorylation status was also observed in the

majority of colorectal cancer cell lines studied, regardless
of their sensitivity to TRAIL (data not shown). The
non-transformed CO841 colon cells likewise showed
the expected decrease in total and phospho-AKT
levels following treatment with 17-AAG alone or in
combination with TRAIL. IKKα was also depleted in the
non-transformed CO841 cells, but not to the same extent
as in the TRAIL-resistant RKO or TRAIL-sensitive
HCT116 cancer cells (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig.
6). Furthermore, in contrast to the results in cancer cells,
all the single agent and combination treatments increased
c-IAP1 expression in these cells (Fig. 5B). XIAP levels
were not altered in non-transformed CO841 colon cells
after co-treatment compared to single agents and untreated
controls (Fig. 5B). Overall, the non-transformed CO841
colon epithelial cells showed lower modulation of
survival proteins in response to the drug combinations
when compared to the colorectal cancer lines, indicating
that these non-transformed cells are less sensitive to the
amplification of the TRAIL apoptotic stimulus induced
by co-treatment with PI-103 or 17-AAG. We observed a
decrease in XIAP levels following 17-AAG plus TRAIL
also in the less TRAIL-sensitive HT29 cancer cells, and in
this tumor cell line we noted XIAP basal levels were lower
compared to SW620 and RKO cancer cell lines (Fig. 5A
and data not shown). In addition, a decrease in XIAP
expression following single or combination treatments
was observed in SW620 TRAIL-resistant tumor cells (Fig.
5C).

To mimic the effect of combination treatments on
XIAP, we transfected the TRAIL-resistant RKO tumor
cells with two different XIAP siRNA or control siRNA
for 48h and then treated the cells with 200 ng/ml TRAIL
for 24h. Silencing XIAP increased apoptosis after TRAIL
treatment as shown by a greater level of cleaved PARP
(Fig. 5D). XIAP knockdown followed by TRAIL treatment
resulted in significantly lower cell viability compared to
control siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 5E). This suggests
that the synergistic effect of the combination treatments
in colorectal cancer cells was consistent with decreased
survival signaling resulting in decreased expression of
XIAP.
Pre-incubation of RKO cells with 20 μM Z-IETDFMK, a caspase-8 inhibitor [40], resulted in inhibition
of the apoptotic effect induced by TRAIL and TRAIL
plus 17-AAG. Pretreatment with the caspase 3 inhibitor
Z-DEVD-FMK also decreased PARP cleavage although to
a lesser extent than Z-IETD-FMK (Fig. 5F). Furthermore,
pretreatment with the Z-IETD-FMK in the combination
did not rescue the levels AKTSer473 back to the levels
observed when cells were treated with 17-AAG alone
(Fig. 5G). XIAP levels were only slightly rescued by
caspase 8 inhibition under the same conditions. These
observations suggest that the decreases in AKTSer473 and
XIAP levels were unlikely to be a direct consequence of
caspase 8 activation (Fig. 5G). In contrast, in RKO tumor
cells treated with the TRAIL plus 17-AAG combination,
Z-IETD-FMK exposure resulted in the levels of depleted
HSP90 client proteins such as ERBB2, IKKα and AKT
returning to those observed in tumor cells treated with
17-AAG alone (Fig. 5G). This suggested that caspase 8
activation contributed to the potent effects of the TRAIL
plus 17-AAG combination on these HSP90 client proteins.

xenografts (Fig. 6A).
Consistent with the effectiveness of the combination
treatments, combining 17-AAG and TRAIL significantly
increased the percentage of TUNEL-positive apoptotic
cells compared to control, whereas only a slight and nonsignificant increase was observed for the single treatments
in the short-term biomarker study (Fig. 6B). Immunoblot
analysis showed that cleavage of PARP and activation
of caspase 8 was greater in the combination treatment
compared to single agents in the same study. Moreover,
ERBB2, IKKα levels were significantly lower in the
combination treatment group as compared to single agent
and control samples; XIAP was significantly lower in 17AAG and 17-AAG plus TRAIL groups in the short-term
study (Fig. 6C, 6D). ERBB2 was identified as the most
robust biomarker at the end of treatment; its expression
following the long-term therapy experiment shown in Fig.
6A was significantly lower in the SW620 tumors treated
with 17-AAG plus TRAIL compared to control or the
single agent treatments (Supplementary Fig. 7A). In the
RKO tumor model we observed a significant decrease
of ERBB2 in all the treatments with p values indicating
stronger significance for the combination treatment
(Supplementary Fig.7B).
These data show that the combination of 17-AAG
plus TRAIL inhibited the growth of colorectal tumor
xenografts in vivo more effectively than did the single
agents via a greater induction of apoptosis and with
concomitant biomarker modulation.

DISCUSSION
The selectivity of TRAIL towards some cancer cells
combined with its relatively low toxicity have made it
a very attractive potential therapeutic agent in different
cancers [7,44]. However, sensitivity to TRAIL may vary
between individual tumors, as for example in the case
of colorectal cancer demonstrated here and elsewhere
[30,41]. Although human recombinant TRAIL as a single
agent has been reported to be safe and well tolerated in
Phase I clinical trials, only 46% of the patients had stable
disease after a second cycle of treatment (>6 months) [44].
This interesting but limited response and lack of activity in
the remaining patients may be due to intrinsic or acquired
resistance. In view of this, the combination of TRAIL with
other therapeutic agents has the potential to improve its
efficacy and give a better outcome in a higher percentage
of patients.
A number of studies have explored this concept;
at present, therapies combined with TRAIL or TRAIL
receptor antibodies in clinical trials include cytotoxic
regimens including cisplatin or radiotherapy which
enhance the intrinsic apoptotic pathway leading to
the amplification of TRAIL-induced apoptosis [45].
Combining TRAIL or TRAIL receptor agonists with
selective molecularly targeted agents is also being

GROWTH
INHIBITION
OF
TRAILRESISTANT COLON TUMOR XENOGRAFTS
WITH THE COMBINATION OF TRAIL PLUS
17-AAG
To further assess the therapeutic potential of our
combinatorial approach, we prioritized the combination of
TRAIL plus the representative HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG.
This was based on the generally more pronounced effects
of 17-AAG versus PI-103 when combined with TRAIL
on IKKα and XIAP, together with the greater suitability of
17-AAG for in vivo use [24,34]. We tested the effects of
the 17-AAG plus TRAIL combination treatment in vivo in
two different human colorectal tumor xenograft models,
RKO and SW620. Both colorectal cancer cell lines
showed resistance to TRAIL as a single agent in vitro (Fig.
1) and also in vivo as established tumor xenografts (Fig.
6). Importantly, the combination of 17-AAG and TRAIL
resulted in greater tumor growth inhibition compared to
single agents in both RKO and SW620 colorectal tumor

evaluated as a strategy to amplify TRAIL-induced
apoptosis [12,13]. The use of targeted therapies in
combination with TRAIL has at least two potential
advantages: amplification of TRAIL-induced apoptosis
and reduction of side-effects compared to combinations
involving cytotoxic agents.
The mechanism of resistance to TRAIL is not
completely understood. Reports in the literature [18]
have variously reported that differential expression of
receptors or decoy-receptors, increased expression of
anti-apoptotic factors like FLIP or IAPs, or increased
activation/expression of oncoproteins involved in cell
survival (including ERBB2, PI3 Kinase, AKT and
IKK) may all reduce TRAIL sensitivity. Paradoxically,
TRAIL itself is also capable of inducing survival
pathways such as PI3 Kinase, NFκ-B or MAPK [18].
Activating mutations of oncogenes such as KRAS, BRAF
or PIK3CA that are common to colon cancer have been
reported to be associated with resistance to cytotoxic
agents or molecularly targeted drugs [46]. Inhibition of
FLIP expression by siRNA has been demonstrated to
induce death-ligand independent apoptosis in colorectal
carcinoma cells [8] and has been shown to have supraadditive effects with TRAIL treatment in some colorectal
cancer cells, although these cells were mostly TRAILsensitive [43,49]. Additionally, some chemotherapeutic
agents have also been shown to inhibit FLIP expression
and sensitize cells to treatment with TRAIL [41,47].
From our screen of 27 human colorectal cancer
cell lines, we found that 14 of them responded to
TRAIL, while the remaining 13 malignant cell lines were
highly resistant up to a concentration of 250 ng/ml. In
addition, two non-tumorigenic normal colon lines were
also insensitive to TRAIL. Interestingly, we observed
no correlation between TRAIL sensitivity and mutations
of KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA in our colorectal cancer cell
panel. In addition, in a subset of this panel we were unable
to find an association between TRAIL sensitivity and basal
expression of TRAIL receptors or FLIP, suggesting that
the mechanism of resistance for these cells was not at the
level of death receptor expression or a known inhibitor of
death receptor associated caspases. Intriguingly, we noted
a transient apoptotic response to the ligand in a number
of TRAIL-resistant colorectal cancer lines, similar to that
reported in human prostate adenocarcinoma cells [17].
The mechanism of resistance remains unclear in colorectal
cell lines where this effect is seen. We hypothesized
that the development of resistance to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in these colorectal cancer cells may be due
either to increased activity/expression of survival proteins
or decreased activity/expression of pro-apoptotic factors.
PI3 Kinase and HSP90-client regulated pathways
are often activated in colorectal cancer [20-22]. Targeting
PI3 Kinase or HSP90 with potent selective inhibitors
results in cancer cell growth inhibition and in some cases
limited apoptosis [21-27]. Inhibitors of these molecular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targets are progressing in Phase I/II clinical trials with
evidence of therapeutic activity at well tolerated doses
[22-24]. We have shown here that PI-103 and 17-AAG,
as representative potent and selective PI3 Kinase/mTOR
and HSP90 inhibitors, respectively, were able to increase
sensitivity to TRAIL in colorectal cancer cells. In addition,
in HT29 tumor cells that are resistant to PI-103 through
rapid glucuronidation to an inactive metabolite [34], we
showed that the metabolically stable, potent and selective
pan-class I PI3 Kinase inhibitor and investigational
clinical agent GDC-0941 [42,43] also increased sensitivity
to TRAIL.
Our results suggest a mechanism by which PI-103
and 17-AAG increased sensitivity of colorectal cancer
cells to TRAIL involving amplification of the TRAIL
apoptotic signal through the decreased expression/
activation of key pro-survival proteins on the PI3 Kinase/
AKT axis and IKK/NFκ-B/IAPs pathway. Inhibition
of AKT and IKK activation likely contributed to the
observed decrease in expression of XIAP, possibly via
inhibition of NFκ-B. Further experiments with isogenic
overexpression or knock-out models will be required to
definitively establish the mechanistic contribution of these
pathways and their inhibitors to TRAIL resistance and the
synergistic response to TRAIL treatment respectively.
However, these studies were outside the scope of the
present translational study that was focused primarily on
exploring the therapeutic potential of combining TRAIL
with HSP90 or PI3K inhibitors for the treatment of
TRAIL-resistant tumors and providing pharmacodynamic
biomarkers that support the combination and could be used
clinically in a combination trial. Of interest, a previous
study demonstrated that NO-Cbl, an analogue of vitamin
B12 that delivers nitric oxide, when used in combination
with TRAIL or other chemotherapeutic agents, caused
increased apoptosis via decreased activity of AKT and
IKK, resulting in reduced NFk-B activation and thus
lower XIAP expression [48]. Similarly, bortezomib,
an inhibitor of the proteasome, potentiates the TRAIL
apoptotic signal via multiple mechanisms, including AKT,
NFk-B and XIAP downregulation [49]. We showed that
silencing XIAP followed by TRAIL treatment of TRAILresistant RKO colorectal tumor cells mimicked the effect
of 17-AAG or PI-103 plus TRAIL. This finding supports
the role of decreased XIAP expression in sensitization
to TRAIL, particularly in the case of the 17-AAG and
TRAIL combination where XIAP levels were reduced to
undetectable after 24h of co-treatment in TRAIL-resistant
RKO cancer cells. These observations are consistent with
the demonstration that DR5 antagonist antibody combined
with BV6, a potent IAP inhibitor, synergistically inhibited
tumor growth via amplification of apoptosis in various
tumor cell lines, including colorectal cancer models [50].
Thus, of potential translational and clinical interest,
we have demonstrated that treatment with either the
exemplar PI3 Kinase inhibitor PI-103 or the exemplar
1194

HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG is able to amplify TRAILinduced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells in vitro.
Importantly, to our knowledge for the first time, we have
demonstrated that combinatorial treatment with 17-AAG
and TRAIL resulted in an improved response compared
to the individual agents in vivo in two TRAIL-resistant
human colorectal cancer xenograft models. We showed
that molecular markers for apoptosis, such as DNA
breaks assessed by TUNEL, cleaved PARP, cleaved
caspase 8 and XIAP levels, were all modulated in vivo
by the co-treatment and this biomarker modulation was
consistent with the therapeutic effects seen. In addition,
we demonstrated that HSP90 client proteins such as IKKα
and especially ERBB2 were depleted in both 17-AAG
and, to a greater extent, in 17-AAG plus TRAIL treatment
groups. Furthermore, our observations of the absence
of, or very weak, effects on survival signaling following
the combinatorial treatments in non-transformed CO841
colon epithelial cells suggest the possibility that these
combinations may be relatively less toxic to normal cells.
In summary, we have shown that the decreased
expression or activation of key survival molecules
following treatment with PI3 Kinase/mTOR inhibitor
PI-103 or HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG in combination with
TRAIL was associated with enhanced apoptosis in TRAILresistant colorectal cancer cells. Our results suggest a
mechanistic explanation for the TRAIL sensitization
by the mechanism-based small molecule inhibitors
through inhibition of IKK/NFκ-B/IAPs and decreased
expression of XIAP that will require further experiments
to be confirmed. Notwithstanding the definitive proof of
mechanism, our findings support the use of these survivalrelated molecules as pharmacodynamic biomarkers for
monitoring the sensitization effect. Furthermore, we
provide in vivo proof of concept and supportive biomarker
data for the therapeutic activity of the representative
HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG plus TRAIL combination in
two TRAIL-resistant human colorectal cancer xenograft
models. We conclude that inducing apoptosis by TRAIL in
combination with HSP90 or PI3 Kinase/mTOR inhibitors
may represent a promising potential therapeutic approach
for clinical evaluation in colorectal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling)
containing protease inhibitors (Roche). Immunoblotting
was performed according to standard procedures [34].
All antibodies used were from Cell Signaling except for
ERBB2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and GAPDH (BioRad).

CELL CULTURE AND CELL GROWTH
INHIBITION ASSAY
Cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were
further authenticated in-house by SNP profiling at
the time of the experiments. Mutation status was also
confirmed by mass-spectrometry-based sequencing of
common oncogenic mutations. All were cultured in
DMEM (Sigma Aldrich) and supplemented with 10%
FBS (PAA Laboratories). Cells were maintained at
37º C in a humidified incubator 5% CO2. For growth
inhibition assays, cells were seeded into a 96 well plate
and Sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay was carried out
as described [34]. For combination assays 17-AAG was
added 5 h before TRAIL; PI-103 and GDC-0941 were
added simultaneously with TRAIL. All the treatments
were performed for a total time of 96 h; the median effect
analysis was used for calculation of combination indices
(CI) [51]. For RKO cells synergism was determined using
the method previously described by Hucl and colleagues
[52].

FLOW CYTOMETRY
Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry.
Staining was carried out by suspending 1x105 cells in
0.5 ml 1X Annexin V binding buffer plus FITC-Annexin
V (Cambridge Bioscience) and propidium iodide
(Invitrogen).
To examine cell surface TRAIL receptor expression,
antibodies to DR4, DR5, DcR1 and DcR2 (Axxora) were
used followed by secondary FITC-conjugated antibody
(Axxora). Mouse IgG1 antibodies were used as an isotype
control. Propidium iodide was added to each sample 5min
before analyzing by flow cytometry.

EFFICACY AND PHARMACODYNAMIC
STUDIES IN HUMAN TUMOR XENOGRAFTS
All experiments were performed in accordance
with the local ethical review panel, the UK Home
Office Animals Scientific Procedures Act, 1986 and
UKCCCR and NCRI guidelines [53]. Human colorectal
tumor xenografts were obtained using sub-cutaneous
implantation of 5x106 RKO or SW620 cells in Nude/nu
mice (Harlan). Therapy (long-term study in the text) was
initiated once tumors were established and continued for
15 days in the RKO model and 23 days in the SW620
model. Mice were dosed i.p. 5 days per week with 50
mg/Kg/day for RKO and 40 mg/Kg/day for SW620 17AAG in the morning and with 15 mg/Kg/day TRAIL in
the afternoon. For pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis
mice bearing RKO tumor xenografts were treated for 4
days (short-term study in the text) as described above.
Tumors were removed at 16 h after last TRAIL dose.
Each tumor was divided into two parts, one half being
formalin-fixed and the other half frozen, for analysis
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoblot
respectively.
