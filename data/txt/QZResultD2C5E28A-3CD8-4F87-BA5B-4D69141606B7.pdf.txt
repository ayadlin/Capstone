Abstract
Ex vivo expansion of CD8+ T-cells has been a hindrance for the success of
adoptive T cell transfer in clinic. Currently, preconditioning with chemotherapy is used
to modulate the patient immunity before ACT, however, the tumor microenvironment
beneficial for transferring T cells may also be damaged. Here preconditioning with
single low dose of doxorubicin or paclitaxel combined with fewer CD8+ T-cells was
investigated to verify whether the same therapeutic efficacy of ACT could be achieved.
An E.G7/OT1 animal model that involved adoptive transfer of OVA-specific CD8+
T-cells transduced with a granzyme B promoter-driven firefly luciferase and tomato
fluorescent fusion reporter gene was used to evaluate this strategy. The result showed
that CD8+ T-cells were activated and sustained longer in mice pretreated with one
low-dose Dox or Tax. Enhanced therapeutic efficacy was found in Dox or Tax combined
with 2x106 CD8+ T-cells and achieved the same level of tumor growth inhibition as
that of 5x106 CD8+ T-cells group. Notably, reduced numbers of Tregs and myeloid
derived suppressor cells were shown in combination groups. By contrast, the number
of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and IL-12 were increased. The NF-κB
activity and immunosuppressive factors such as TGF-β, IDO, CCL2, VEGF, CCL22,
COX-2 and IL-10 were suppressed. This study demonstrates that preconditioning with
single low dose Dox or Tax and combined with two fifth of the original CD8+ T-cells
could improve the tumor microenvironment via suppression of NF-κB and its related
immunosuppressors, and activate more CD8+ T-cells which also stay longer.

Introduction

lymphocytes, CTLs [5]. Hence, it is imperative to find a
strategy to enhance the functions while reduce the required
numbers of transferred CD8+ T-cells for ACT.
Cancer cells keep evolving during progression
and could escape from immune surveillance.
Immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β) could inhibit the activation of
CD8+ T-cells, which play the key role in hindrance of
cancer elimination by ACT [6]. TGF-β also decreases
expressions of anti-tumor cytokines including interferon
gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), and further

Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) using tumor-specific
CD8+ T-cells are selected with specific tumor-associated
antigens, expanded and activated with cytokines including
interleukin (IL)-2, -7 and -15, then transfused back to the
patient [1, 2]. However, ACT is currently not applied
widely in clinic since the ex vivo large-scale expansion
of T cells is inefficient and costly [3, 4]. Moreover,
cancer cells may evolve and exert capabilities against
attacks from transferred CD8+ T-cells, i.e. cytotoxic T

restrains proliferation and differentiation of T cells [7,
8]. The secretions of IFN-γ and IL-12 are also inhibited
by IL-10 to impair the function of CD8+ T-cells [9].
Moreover, secretion of TGF-β, IL-10, chemokine (CC
motif) ligand 22 (CCL22), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) will recruit
immune regulatory cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs)
and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into
tumor lesions [10-12]. Accumulation of these cells will
suppress the functions and proliferation of CD8+ T-cells
[13]. Furthermore, IDO expressed by cancer cells converts
tryptophan into kynurenine which inhibits the proliferation
of T cells and hinder the conversion of Tregs into TH17
[14, 15]. Expressions of CCL2, COX-2 and VEGF are also
related to invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis [16-18].
Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
activated B cells (NF-κB), a transcription factor, has
been shown to play a key hub for immune regulations
[19-21]. NF-κB may promote the tumor formation and
progression through up-regulation of its downstream
effectors including TGF-β, IL-10, CCL2, COX-2,
VEGF and CCL22 [22, 23]. Cancer cells could escape
from the immune surveillance with expressions of these
proteins. Thus targeting NF-κB may be an achievable
strategy to modify the immunosuppression of tumor
microenvironment [24]. Some chemotherapeutic or
targeted drugs have been proposed to trigger antitumor
immunity other than eliminate cancer cells directly
[25]. Our recent findings suggest that serial low doses
of curcumin or sorafenib combined with ACT exhibit
better tumor inhibition [26, 27]. However, it has been
reported that Dox and Tax may induce the activation of
NF-κB under the administration of clinical dosage [2830]. Thus, preconditioning using optimal dosage of Dox
or Tax to avoid activating NF-κB and its downstream
effectors is critical for the success of ACT. Here we aimed
to investigate whether single low dose of Dox or Tax
prior to ACT could augment the treatment outcome and
the related underlying mechanisms. The pGBeLT reporter
system established by Patel et al. to monitor the activation
of transferred CD8+ T-cells for ACT in E.G7/OT-1 mouse
model was used [31]. Immunosuppressive cytokines and
other immune cells such as Tregs and MDSCs were also
determined.

κB inhibitor, respectively, were shown in Supplementary
Figure 1A-1C. The expressions of TGF-β, CCL2, VEGF,
CCL22, COX-2 and IL-10 in E.G7 cells were significantly
suppressed by 0.4 μM Dox, 12.5 nM Tax and 5 nM QNZ
(Figure 1A). To mimic the tumor microenvironment,
500 U/mL IFN-γ was added into the cultured medium
to stimulate the expression of IDO, an enzyme often
overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment. IDO
was highly expressed after IFN-γ stimulation, but was
suppressed by Dox (0.4 µM), Tax (12.5 nM) and QNZ
(5 nM), respectively (Figure 1B). Notably, significant
inhibitions of NF-κB/DNA binding activity by Dox and
Tax were also found (Figure 1C).

Enhancement of CD8+ T-cells activation and
migration by one low-dose Dox or Tax is through
downregulation of NF-κB activation in E.G7 cells
The percentages of intracellular IFN-γ-, IL-2and tomato fluorescence-positive CD8+ T-cells were
increased significantly in low-dose Dox, Tax and QNZpretreated groups compared with that of vehicle (Figure
2A-2C), suggested that low-dose Dox, Tax and QNZ could
enhance the activation of CD8+ T-cells. The transwell
assay also showed that the numbers of migrated T cells
were increased by the treatments of low-dose Dox, Tax
and QNZ (Figure 2D).

Single low dose Dox or Tax suppresses expressions
of immunosuppressive factors through inhibition
of NF-κB activity
E.G7 tumor-bearing mice were established on
day -7 and treated with or without single low doses of
Dox (1 and 4 mg/kg) or Tax (5 and 10 mg/kg) on day
-1, followed by ACT on day 0, and mice were sacrificed
on day3. The expressions of TGF-β, IDO, CCL2, VEGF,
CCL22, COX-2 and IL-10 in tumors were significantly
reduced in Dox- and Tax-treated groups (Figures 3A and
3B). The results were similar with those found in vitro.
Notably, these immunosuppressive factors were decreased
starting from day 1 post single low dose Dox and Tax
treatment, respectively, as shown in Supplementary Figure
2A and 2B. The NF-κB/DNA binding activity in tumors
was suppressed in both Dox- and Tax-treated groups as
demonstrated with EMSA (Figure 3C).

single low-dose Dox or Tax treatment (Figures 3D and
3E). Significant decreases of these immunosuppressors
were also found on day 1 post one low-dose Dox or Tax
treatment as shown in Supplementary Figure 2C and 2D.
On the contrary, the levels of serum IL-12 were increased
on day 3 post one low-dose Dox or Tax treatment
determined with ELISA (Figure 3F).

A granzyme B promoter-driven firefly luciferase and
tomato fluorescent fusion reporter gene (pGBeLT) system
was used to monitor the activation and distribution of
transferred OT-1 CD8+ T-cells. The baseline images were
acquired at 4 hours after ACT, and the activation of OT-1
CD8+ T-cells were monitored by BLI at designated time
points as shown in Figure 4D. The signals emitted from
tumors were increased and peaked on day 5 post ACT for
both combination groups, and were significantly higher
than those of 5T and 2T groups, respectively (Figure
4E). The levels of cleaved caspase-3 in tumors were most
increased, by contrast, IDOs were severely decreased on
day 3 post ACT in two combination groups assayed with
Western blot (Figure 4F).

Therapeutic efficacy of ACT is improved by
pretreatment with single low dose Dox or Tax
Since we have found that 70 mg/kg/d curcumin
combined with 5×106 OT-1 CD8+ T-cells could
completely inhibit the growth of E.G7 tumor, 5×106 OT-1
CD8+ T-cells were also used here [27]. E.G7 tumorbearing mice were randomly separated into seven groups
(n = 6 per group) as described in the method when the
average tumor size reached about 100 mm3. Single low
dose Dox (4 mg/kg) or Tax (10 mg/kg) was injected
intraperitoneally prior to ACT, and was designated as
day -1. The entire experimental protocol was shown in
Figure 4A. Significant tumor shrinkage was found in two
combination groups (i.e. Dox+2T and Tax+2T) on day 3
post ACT compared with that of the control group (Figure
4B). Notably, the tumor growth inhibition of combination
groups were the same compared with that of 5T group
(T stands for 1 x 106 OT-1 CD8+ T-cells). No significant
body weight change was found in all groups throughout
the experiment (Figure 4C).

Ratios of tumor-infiltrating CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs/
CD8+ CTLs are decreased in experimental groups
From immunohistochemical analysis, tumorinfiltrating CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs were decreased while
tumor-infiltrating CTLs were increased in all experimental
groups especially in combination groups compared
with those of the control group (Figures 5A and 5B).
Accordingly, ratios of CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs/CD8+ CTLs
were significantly decreased in two combination groups
compared with that of the control or drug alone (Figure
5C).

Discussion

might be a feasible approach to improve the therapeutic
efficacy of ACT. The doses of Dox and Tax used in this
study are defined as “low-dose” compared with the clinical
dosages based on the formula proposed by Reagan-Shaw
et al. [38]. According to the formula, 1-4 mg/kg Dox and
5-10 mg/kg Tax in this study were equivalent to 3-12 mg/
m2 Dox and 15-30 mg/m2 Tax in clinic.
The expressions of immunosuppressive factors
in E.G7 cells including TGF-β, CCL2, VEGF, CCL22,
COX-2 and IL-10 were decreased after treatment with
low-dose Dox (0.4 µM) or Tax (12.5 nM) as shown in
Figure 1A. CCL2, CCL22, TGF-β and IL-10 augment the
differentiation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) and recruitment of immunosuppressors including
TAMs, MDSCs and Tregs [39]. These immunosuppressors
secret TGF-β, IL-10 and other chemokines, result in more
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. CCL2 has
been shown to be pivotal for immunosuppression, and
the CCL2/CCR2 pathway could be a potential target for
cancer therapy [16, 17]. IDO which catalyzes tryptophan
into kynurenine is overexpressed by cancer cells to

Large scale ex vivo expansion of tumor-specific T
cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
have been the hindrance for clinical application of ACT
[3, 4]. The numbers, survival and activities of transferred
CD8+ T-cells are factors affecting the tumor cell killing in
situ during ACT [32]. To reverse the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment may be one of the most
challenging issues in cancer immunotherapy [33]. Some
“off-target” effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on innate
and adaptive immunity rather than cytotoxicity have been
found [25, 34]. Better tumor responses were also found
in the groups received both chemotherapy and ACT
[27, 35, 36]. However, myelosuppression induced by
chemotherapy limits the clinical use of both Dox and Tax
[37]. Here we found that single low dose pretreatment of
Dox or Tax could improve the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment through increasing the number, activity
and functions of tumor-infiltrating transferred CD8+
T-cells in an E.G7/OT-1 mouse model. Hence, this strategy

function as an immunosuppressive factor. The expressions
of both endogenous and exogenous IDOs were suppressed
by low-dose Dox or Tax (Figure 1B). TGF-β also increases
IDO expression through activating non-conical NFκB pathway [40]. The NF-κB/DNA binding activity
detected by EMSA assay was significantly inhibited by
low-dose Dox and Tax (Figure 1C). According to these
results support that low-dose Dox or Tax may function as
a NF-κB inhibitor. NF-κB may function as a substantial

regulator in tumor microenvironment. Activated
NF-κB in tumor cells results in high expressions of
immunosuppressive factors such as IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β
and VEGF, and impedes the anti-tumor immunity [19,
41]. Since the functions and proliferation of transferred
CD8+ T-cells could be impaired by immunosuppressive
microenviroment [10], here co-culture of isolated CD8+
T-cells and QNZ (a NF-B inhibitor) pretreated E.G7 cells
showed that the most activation (IFN-γ, IL-12, Tomato+ T

cells) and migration (infiltrating T cells) of CD8+ T-cells
were found (Figures 2A-2D). These results conclude
that inhibition of NF-κB may enhance the activation
and migration of transferred CD8+ T-cells. Our animal
studies further confirm these findings. NF-κB/DNA
binding activity and immunosuppressive factors were
decreased in tumors of mice pretreated with single lowdose Dox or Tax (Figures 3A-3C). The numbers of Tregs
and MDSCs in TDLNs, spleen and bone marrow were
found less accumulated (Figures 3D and 3E). Recently,
Loxoribin, a TLR7 agonist, has been shown to be able to
shrink the tumor through augmenting the proliferation of
CD4+ T cells and lowering the frequency of Tregs, which
is mediated by elevated IL-6 level secreted by DCs. [42].
IL-12 has been shown with anti-tumor effect and could
enhance expressions of other cytokines involving in both
innate and adaptive immunity [43]. The serum levels of
IL-12 in mice were increased in a dose-dependent manner
after pretreatments of low-dose Dox or Tax suggesting that
the function of CD8+ T-cells might be enhanced via IL-12
regulation (Figure 3F). Together, our in vitro and in vivo
results suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of ACT could

be improved when pretreated with single low dose of Dox
or Tax.
Recently, the outcome of ACT in breast cancer has
been shown to be enhanced by low-dose Dox (5 mg/kg
i.v.) plus Th1 or Th17 cells (i.v. or intratumoral), which
results in increased proliferations of CD8+ T-cells and
NK cells through elimination of MDSCs [43]. Here we
demonstrated that single low-dose Dox (4 mg/kg i.p.)
or Tax (10 mg/kg i.p.) administered one day prior to
ACT which used fewer numbers of CD8+ T-cells (i.e.
Dox + 2 x 106 T cells or Tax + 2 x 106 T cells) could
achieve the same tumor inhibition efficacy as that of 5 x
106 T cells group. Since transferred CD8+ T-cells traffic
indiscriminately and ubiquitously into various tissues/
organs and may cause potential side effects [44], thus
minor or neglected adverse effects related to transferred
CD8+ T-cells could be avoided with this combinational
strategy. The activation and survival of transferred CD8+
T-cells were improved in combinational groups assayed
by pGBeLT system (Figures 4D and 4E). Moreover,
the numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells and
Tregs have been reported to closely correlate with the

stock solutions were stored at -20°C. The doses used in
vivo were 1 and 4 mg/kg for Dox and 5 and 10 mg/kg for

prognosis and survival of patients [45, 46]. Alternatively,
the expansion efficiency and the cell function also could
be enhanced by the culturing strategy such as using the
bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells
(BM-MMSC) [47]. Here we have shown that the activity
and number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells were
strikingly increased while the number of tumor-infiltrating
Tregs was diminished in combination groups (Figures 5A5C). The expression of cleaved caspase-3 in tumors was
also significantly increased in combination groups (Figure
5F), suggesting that tumor cell killing by CD8+ T-cells
was through the apoptotic pathway.
In conclusion, our results suggest that tumorbearing mice pretreated with single low-dose Dox or
Tax may improve the therapeutic efficacy of ACT which
using two millions, instead of five millions, of CD8+
T-cells for the treatment of cancer. The therapeutics of
possible underlying mechanisms are the improvement
of the tumor microenvironment through the suppression
of NF-κB and subsequent cytokines such as TGF-β, IL10, VEGF, COX-2, CCL2 and CCL22, and enhancement
the function of transferred CD8+ T-cells (Figure 6). This
combination strategy may be potential to overcome the
current limitation of ACT in clinic.

into seven groups (n = 6 per group): vehicle (control),
4 mg/kg Dox (Dox), 10 mg/kg Tax (Tax), 2x106 CD8+
T-cells (2T), 5x106 CD8+ T-cells (5T), 4 mg/kg Dox plus
2x106 CD8+ T-cells (Dox+2T) and 10 mg/kg Tax plus
2x106 CD8+ T-cells (Tax+2T). Single dose of 4 mg/kg
Dox or 10 mg/kg Tax was administered via i.p. injection,
and transferred OT-1 CD8+ T-cells were given by i.v.
injection. For the combination therapy, Dox or Tax was
given 24 hours before CD8+ T-cells transfer (see Fig. 4A
for details). Tumor volumes were measured with a caliper
and calculated by the formula: length x width2 x 0.523.
The experiments were repeated three times.

Drug treatments and adoptive T cell transfer in
E.G7-bearing mouse model

After 4 hours co-culture, the activations of
CD8+ T-cells were determined by the expressions of
tomato fluorescent protein, intracellular IFN-γ and IL-2
(Biolegend) using flow cytometry. For in vivo study,
the tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and bone
marrow from the vehicle, Dox- and Tax-treated mice
were harvested and analyzed on day 3 post Dox and
Tax administration to trace the percentages of Tregs and
MDSCs (n = 6 per group). The single cell suspensions
isolated from the spleen, TDLNs and bone marrow
were stained with anti-FOXP3-Alexa Fluor 488/CD4APC/CD25-PE antibodies using a Mouse Treg Flow Kit
(Biolegend) according to manufacturer’s protocol, and
CD11b-FITC and Gr-1-PE antibodies (eBioscience) for
detecting Tregs and MDSCs, respectively. The percentages
of these cell types were acquired using FACSCalibur flow
cytometry (BD Bioscience), and data were analyzed by
FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear proteins were isolated from cells or
tumor tissues using Nuclear Extraction Kit (Chemicon
International). The NF-κB/DNA binding activity was
evaluated using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA
kit (Pierce). The isolation and analysis were performed
using protocols provided by the manufacturer. The
following DNA sequences were synthesized for EMSA
analysis: AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC (sense) and
GCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT (antisense). Briefly,
nuclear extracts were incubated with the biotin-labeled
DNA probe for 20 min at room temperature. The DNAprotein complex was separated from free oligonucleotides
on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, then transferred to a nylon
membrane and cross-linked by UV light. The membranes
were further incubated with streptavidin-horseradish
peroxidase, and detected by enhanced ECL. The imageJ
software was used for the quantitative analysis. The
experiments were repeated three times.

Western blotting
To assess the expressions of immunosuppressive
factors, proteins were extracted from E.G7 cells or
removed tumors using lysis buffer and T-PER kit (Thermo
Scientific), respectively. For in vitro studies, 1×106 E.G7
cells were seeded into each 10-cm diameter culture dish
and treated with Dox, Tax and QNZ, respectively, for 24
hours prior to protein extraction. 500 U/ml IFN-γ (BD
Biosciences) was added into the medium to stimulate
E.G7 cells to evaluate whether Dox, Tax and QNZ could
inhibit the expression of exogenous IDO. Protein lysates
were separated by 10-15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall), blocked
with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in TBST (Tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature
for 1 hour. The membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies against anti-IDO, anti-COX-2 (Millipore),
TGF-β, CCL2, (Cell Signaling), anti-MDC (CCL22), antiVEGF, anti-IL-10 and β-actin (Abcam) at 4°C overnight.
After washed with TBST, the membranes were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.)
for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, the proteins of
interest were visualized by the Image Quant LAS-4000
(Fujifilm) with the ECL chemiluminescent detection
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Circulating bloods were drawn from the facial vein
on day 3 after one low-dose Dox or Tax treatment, and
serum samples were prepared by centrifugation at 2000
rpm for 10 min post coagulation. The level of serum IL12 was determined by IL-12 ELISA kit (R&D Systems).

Conflicts of Interest

Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in vivo

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Mice (n = 6 per group) receiving pGBeLTtransduced CD8+T cells were i.p. injected with 150 mg/
kg D-luciferin for 15 min, then anesthetized with 1-3%
isoflurane for imaging. The emitted photons were detected
by the IVIS50 Imaging System (Xenogen) for 5 min. The
Living Image software (Version 2.20, Xenogen) was used
to quantify the signals emitted from the regions of interest
(ROIs).

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors removed from mice were frozen in TissueTek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek) and sectioned with
10 μm thickness, and mounted on glass slides. Sections
were incubated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min to quench
the endogenous peroxidase activity, then rinsed with
PBS. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies
against CD8 and FOXP3 at 4°C overnight, developed
with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), and
finally counterstained with hematoxylin. All the staining
procedures were followed the protocols provided by the
manufacturer of IHC Select HRP/DAB kit (Millipore).
CD8+ cells were defined as CTLs, and FOXP3+ cells
were defined as Tregs. Slides were imaged with Olympus
BX 61 microscope equipped with color CCD under 100 x
magnification. Five slides were imaged and analyzed per
group.
