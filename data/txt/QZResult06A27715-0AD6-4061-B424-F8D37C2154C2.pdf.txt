ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and depression in late life are one of the most severe
health problems in the world disorders. Serotonin 6 receptor (5-HT6R) has caused
much interest for potential roles in AD and depression. However, a causative role of
perturbed 5-HT6R function between two diseases was poorly defined. In the present
study, we found that a 5-HT6R antagonist, SB271036 rescued memory impairment
by attenuating the generation of Aβ via the inhibition of γ-secretase activity and the
inactivation of astrocytes and microglia in the AD mouse model. It was found that
the reduction of serotonin level was significantly recovered by SB271036, which
was mediated by an indirect regulation of serotonergic neurons via GABA. Selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine significantly improved cognitive
impairment and behavioral changes. In human brain of depression patients, we then
identified the potential genes, amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein-binding, family
A, member 2 (APBA2), well known AD modulators by integrating datasets from
neuropathology, microarray, and RNA seq. studies with correlation analysis tools. And
also, it was demonstrated in mouse models and patients of AD. These data indicate
functional network of 5-HT6R between AD and depression.

INTRODUCTION

understood and probably complex.
Serotonin 6 receptor (5-HT6R) is one of the latest
cloned receptors among the known 5-HT receptors and
positively coupled to adenylate cyclase via Gs proteins
[7]. The receptor has been reported to be intensively
expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), especially
in the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex [8]. 5-HT6R has
shown a high affinity for antipsychotic drugs (loxapine
and clozapine) as well as tricyclic antidepressant drugs
(amitryptyline, clomipramine, and amoxipine) [9]. The
abundant distribution in limbic region that participates in
the control of mood and emotion, and the high affinity
for antipsychotic and antidepressant compounds have

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and depression are
disorders of enormous and increasing public health
significance [1]. Considerably higher incidences of
depression are caused among aging [2]. Depression may
be the initial sign of neurodegenerative disease and thus
may be regarded as a risk factor for later development of
AD [3]. Some studies showed higher rates of AD in those
who have suffered from depression [1, 4], suggesting that
the neurodegenerative process is accelerated [5-6]. Thus,
depression is a potential risk factor for AD. However, the
relationship between AD and depression is incompletely

caused much interest for the significant roles in the CNS
[10-11]. In AD, considerable reductions in 5-HT6R density
have been found in cortical areas of AD patients [12]. In
preclinical studies of rodents and primates, it was reported
that 5-HT6R antagonists enhance cognitive performance
in a wide variety of learning and memory paradigms
and also results in antidepressant-like activity [13-14].
In depression, preclinical data suggest potential roles for
5-HT6R. 5-HT6R antagonists have also been reported to
produce antidepressant-like effects using the forced swim
and tail suspension tests in both rats and mice [15-16].
Nevertheless, causative studies for functional network of
5-HT6R between AD and depression were not defined. We,
therefore, hypothesized that 5-HT6R could play a critical
role in link between AD and depression, which could
unveil the correlation between AD and depression via
common network of 5-HT6R.
In present study, we demonstrated that 5-HT6R

regulates memory impairment and serotonin, which is
reduced by GABA in the AD mouse model. We found that
APBA1/2 related with amyloid beta A4 precursor protein
(APP) metabolism in AD [17-19] was correlated with
5-HT6R in depression patients, and regulated by 5-HT6R in
the AD mouse model, suggesting significant implications
for the network of 5-HT6R between AD and depression.

RESULTS
5-HT6R modulates cognitive impairment,

AD mouse model, we performed behavioral tests using
Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. Mice
were subjected to the Morris water maze test which is a
widely known test for learning and memory. We found that
Aβ1-42 infused mice learned more slowly than did control
mice, as evidenced by slower escape latency during the
acquisition training days without any difference in swim
speed (Figure 1A, 1B). The learning and memory deficit
was rescued after administration of SB271046 (10 mg/
kg, once daily, i.p) (Figure 1A, 1B). Probe test was also
confirmed the beneficial effect of SB271046 by calculating
the time spent in the target quadrant zone (Figure 1C).
We, next, subjected mice to the passive avoidance test
that they learned to avoid a dark chamber after exposure
to an electrical foot shock, followed by a retention test
on the next day. Learning and memory capacities were
impaired in Aβ1-42 infused mice, as evidenced by a
significant reduction in latency to enter the dark chamber.
Administration of SB271046 restored the learning and

memory deficit in the passive avoidance test (Figure 1D).
To investigate whether SB271046 influenced
amyloidogenesis, the levels of Aβ1-42 was determined with
ELISA analysis. Elevated Aβ1-42 was significantly lowered
by SB271046 in the AD mouse model (Figure 2A). As
assessed by enzymatic cleavage assays to measure β
and γ-secretase activity, the activity of β and γ-secretase
significantly increased in the brain of AD mouse model
(Figure 2B, 2C). The alteration in β-secretase activity
was not changed by the administration of SB271046
(Figure 2B), however, -secretase activity was attenuated
by SB271046 in the AD mouse model (Figure 2C). We,
next, investigated inflammatory response. Consistent
with a previous report [20-21], we found that GFAPpositive cells (astrocytes), Iba1-positive cells (microglia),
and iNOS were elevated in the AD mouse model, while
SB271046 attenuated the expression of GFAP, Iba1, and
iNOS (Figure 2D-2F).

5-HT6R-mediated GABA regulation reverses
cognitive impairment in the AD mouse model

suggesting that 5-HT6R is not a direct modulator on
serotonergic neurons to release serotonin. Since it has
been reported that 5-HT6R was colocalized in GABAergic
neurons [8], we measured inhibitory neurotransmitter
GABA level in AD mouse model. SB271046 significantly
decreased GABA level in AD mouse model (Figure
3D), suggesting 5-HT6R regulates serotonergic neurons
and serotonin release via GABA. We explored whether
the increased serotonin was able to improve memory
impairment with same experiment of SB271046 in
the AD mouse model. A selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI), Fluoxetine showed significantly better
performance on the water maze test in AD mouse model
(Figure 4A, 4B). During the probe test, we calculated the
time spent in the target quadrant zone during the 60 second
test. The memory deficiency was significantly improved
by Fluoxetine (Figure 4C). To further determine whether

We showed that 5-HT6R was distributed in dorsal
raphe nucleus (DRN), cortex (Cx), and hippocampus
(Hp) regions (CA1, CA3, DG) region in the mouse brains
(Figure 3A), and it was previously reported that WAY181187 tonically decreased neurotransmitter serotonin
level in the brains, and the effect was reversed by
SB271046 [22], implying that 5-HT6R may play important
roles on serotonergic neurons. Therefore, we investigated
whether 5-HT6R is involved in regulation of serotonergic
neurons in the AD mouse model. As shown in Figure 3B,
serotonin level was lowered by Aβ1-42 infusion, however
SB271046 rescued serotonin level in AD mouse model.
However, there was no difference on the cell number of
TPH2-positive cells (serotonergic neurons) (Figure 3C),

with serotonin level. We further explored correlation
between expression levels of two ABPA genes such as
APBA1 and APBA2 and those of serotonin receptors
in the hippocampus of individuals with depression and
unaffected controls using RNA sequencing data which
were deposited in the SNCID. Expression levels of 7
isoforms of serotonin receptor genes were analyzed, and
5-HT6R is closely correlated with APBA1/2 compared
to other receptors (Table 1). To order to validate the
correlation between 5-HT6R and APBA1/2, we analyzed
mRNA in depression patients, AD patients, and AD mouse
model. As shown in Figure 6A, 5-HT6R mRNA was
significantly correlated with APBA1 and APBA2 in brain
tissues of depression patients. In APP mutant mice of AD,
it was also found that level of 5-HT6R mRNA was reduced
in parallel with APBA2 (Figure 6B, 6C).

DISCUSSION

decreased serotonin level, which was attenuated by
SB271046 [22]. Therefore, we expected that 5-HT6R
affects serotonergic neurons and regulates serotonin level
in the AD mouse model. However we failed to detect the
significant reduction of serotonergic neuron in the AD
mouse model, at which 5-HT6R did not affect the number
of serotonergic neuron. Our results indicate that 5-HT6R
indirectly regulates serotonin level in the AD mouse
model. Previously, it was reported that 5-HT6R was colocalized on GABAergic neurons, implying 5-HT6R may
modify GABAergic neurotransmission in many brain
areas via the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA [8].
GABAergic afferents synapse with serotonergic neurons
and have a significant effect on serotonergic neurons in
the DRN [36-37]. GABAA and GABAB receptor agonists
significantly decreased serotonin level [38-39], while
GABAA receptor antagonists increased serotonin level
[40]. In an AD mouse model, GABA release aberrantly
increased [41-42], and GABAA receptor antagonists were
shown to improve long term potentiation and memory
[43], indicating that the aberrant GABAergic transmission
exacerbates cognition in AD patients. Consistent with
this observation, we found that the level of GABA
was reduced by 5-HT6R in the AD mouse model. The
observation could be validated in another aspect. Since
GABAergic neurons synapse directly with cholinergic
neurons [8], the regulation of 5-HT6R on cholinergic
transmission may occur in AD. In the present study, we
proved that scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction
was attenuated by 5-HT6R (Supplementary Figure 1).
The results support our idea for an indirect effect on
serotonergic neuron via GABA. Thus, we suggest that
5-HT6R controls serotonin level via GABAergic neurons
but not serotonergic neurons in the AD mouse model.
Amyloidogenesis posits that the aberrant
metabolism and aggregation of Aβ causes a cascade of
neuronal and inflammatory injury, leading to neuronal
dysfunction and cell death in AD [44-46]. In the present
study, we demonstrated that 5-HT6R attenuated the
amyloid generation in the AD mouse model. The effect of
5-HT6R is likely attributable to the activity of γ-secretase
but not β-secretase activity. We found that SB270146
and Fluoxetine reduced γ-secretase activity and did
not affect β-secretase activity in the AD mouse model.
Several studies support our findings. For instance, it
was reported that administration of SSRIs reduced brain
Aβ levels in mice [47-48], and also two components of
the γ-secretase complex, presenilin (PS)-1 and nicastrin
were significantly reduced in a SSRI, citalopram-treated
mice [49]. Furthermore APBA1/2 directly interacted with
APP and γ-secretase and impaired γ-secretase activity
to inhibit Aβ metabolisms in AD [19, 50-52]. Thus, we
suggest that the regulation of APBA1/2 via 5-HT6R
improves cognitive dysfunction in the AD mouse model
by inhibiting γ-secretase activity. Although we firstly
found that the network of 5-HT6R-Serotonin-APBA1/2

In the present study, we found that 5-HT6R improved
the symptom of AD. The neurotransmitter serotonin has
been known to regulate a variety of neurobehavioral
processes, including cognition, memory, and mood [2324]. Serotonergic neurotransmissions were reduced by
approximately 40% in human postmortem material of AD
patients [25-26]. Impaired serotonergic neurotransmission
also appeared to be a central dysfunction leading to
depression [1]. Disappointingly, none of the approaches
have successively resolved correlation between the two
diseases, although AD as a risk factor for depression has
been considered and vice versa [4-5]. Actually, it is difficult
to search co-effective factors related with depression in
AD, since depression is complex mood disorder caused
by a variety of reasons such as environmental factors,
hereditary factors, and lifestyle [27-28]. Therefore, we
planned a strategy to find new co-factors related with
AD via human brain of depression patients within the
category of 5-HT6R and serotonin. By integrating datasets
from neuropathology, microarray, and RNA seq. studies
with correlation analysis tools, we identified APBA1/2,
known modifiers of APP processing and endocytic
trafficking in AD [19]. The molecular mechanisms
underlying the suppression of APP amyloidogenic
metabolism by APBA1/2 have been addressed. For
example, in the brains of APBA1/2 knockout mice, APP
metabolism and Aβ generation were suppressed [17,
29-30]. APBA1/2 transgenic mice crossed to APPswe
transgenic mice which are used as an AD mouse model
demonstrated reduced Aβ deposition compared [31-32].
Recently, APBA2 was included as several known or novel
modifiers in co-expression correlation network analysis
of the apolipoprotein E e4 allele (APOE4, a genetic
factor in AD) and AD transcriptomic changes [18]. To the
best of our knowledge, it has been not reported for the
involvement of APBA1/2 in depression until now. Thus,
it is of interest to find the correlation of APBA1/2 with
5-HT6R in depression patients. We suggest that APBA1/2
is novel proteins regulated by 5-HT6R in AD, as well as
our data imply the novel function of APBA1/2 via 5-HT6R
in depression.
The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is a brainstem
nucleus located in the midbrain and pons, where
serotonergic neurons are clustered and project a multitude
of brain areas such as cortex, hippocampus, amygdala,
basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus, at which they
utilize many transmitters to control various physiological
functions, including cognition and emotional states
[33-35]. Thus, DRN has been associated with the
pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric
syndromes, such as depression, suicide, and AD. In the
present study, it was found that 5-HT6R was expressed
on DRN and its target region, cortex and hippocampus
regions (CA1, CA3, and DG), and WAY-181187 tonically

occurs in depression patients by analyzing human
depression patients, we are further studying to demonstrate
the functional network of 5HT6R-Serotonin-APBA1/2 in
a depression mouse model. In conclusion, we originally
investigated the relationship of 5-HT6R-serotoninAPBA1/2 between AD and depression, and we suggest a
potential mechanism for the network of 5HT6R-serotoninAPBA1/2 in the AD mouse model. Our data provide the
evidence that the functional network has critical roles in
both AD and depression, as well as provide the concept
that the network modulation gives rise to great potential
in both prevention and treatment of AD and depression.

Water maze test
The learning and memory capacity were assessed
using two separate tests (water maze and passive avoidance
tests). The water maze test is a widely accepted method
for testing memory. The examination was performed using
the SMART-CS (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) program and
equipment. A circular plastic pool (height 35 cm, diameter
100 cm) was filled with water (containing milk) kept at 2225 °C. An escape platform (height 14.5 cm, diameter 4.5
cm) was positioned submerged 0.5-1 cm below the surface
of the water. The test was performed three times per day
for 7 days. Each trial lasted for 60 s or ended as soon as the
mouse reached the submerged platform and was allowed
to remain on the platform for 2 s. The mice were allowed
to swim until they sought the escape platform. Escape
latency, escape distance, swimming speed, and swimming
pattern of each mouse were monitored by a camera
above the center of the pool connected to a SMART-LD
program (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). A quiet environment,
consistent lighting, constant water temperature, and fixed
spatial frame were maintained throughout the period of
the experiment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male ICR mice (20-25 g) were purchased from
Samtako, and were maintained in accordance with the
National Institute of Toxicological Research of the Korea
Food and Drug Administration guideline for the humane
care and use of laboratory animals. All of the experimental
procedures in the present study were approved by IACUC
of Chungbuk National University (approval number:
CBNUA-144-1001-01). Animals were housed in a room
that was automatically maintained at 21~25oC and relative
humidity (45~65%) with a controlled light-dark cycle. All
animals had free access to food (Samyang Foods, Seoul,
Korea) and water. Behavioral testing was done during the
light cycle of the day (between 14.00-18.00 h). Diethyl
ether was used in animal experiments as a euthanasia
agent. After appropriate quantity of ether was poured onto
cotton wool and allowed to evaporate and fill the chamber,
the animals were placed on the ether soaked cotton wool
under a mesh so that the animals do not have direct
contact with the liquid chemical (ether). After euthanasia,
the animal carcasses and the soaked cotton wool were
removed and placed inside the chemical fume hood to
allow dissipation of the chemical. The extraction system of
the fume hood remained switched on for a further period
of 30 minutes after the animal carcasses were handled
following standard clinical waste procedures.

Probe test
A probe test to assess memory consolidation was
performed two days after the 7 days acquisition tests. In
this test, the platform was removed from the tank, and
the mice were allowed to swim freely. For these tests,
the spent time on the target quadrant within 60 s were
recorded. The time spent in the target quadrant was taken
to indicate the degree of memory consolidation that had
taken place after learning. The swimming pattern of each
mouse was monitored by a camera above the center of
the pool connected to a SMART-LD program as described
above.

Passive avoidance performance test

AD mouse model

The passive avoidance test is also widely accepted
as a simple and rapid method for testing memory. The
passive avoidance response was determined using a “stepthrough” apparatus (Med Associates, Georgia, VT, USA)
that consists of an illuminated and a dark compartment
(each 20.3 × 15.9 × 21.3 cm) adjoining each other through
a small gate with a grid floor of 3.175 mm stainless steel
rods set 8 mm apart. One day after the probe test, the
training trial was performed. The mouse was placed in
the illuminated compartment facing away from the dark
compartment. When the mouse moved completely into the

The anesthetized animals were placed in a sterotaxic
instrument, and catheters were attached to an osmotic minipump (Alzet 1002, ALZA, Mountain View, CA, USA) and
brain infusion kit 1 (Alzet kit 3-5 mm, ALZA, Mountain
View, CA, USA) which were implanted according to the
following coordinates: mouse (unilaterally): − 1.0 mm
anterior/posterior, + 0.5 mm medial/lateral and − 2.5 mm

dark compartment, it received an electric shock (1 mA, 3 s
duration). Then the mouse was returned to its home cage.
One day later, the mouse was placed in the illuminated
compartment and the latency period to enter the dark
compartment, defined as “retention,” was measured.
The time when the mouse entered the dark compartment
was recorded and described as step-through latency. The
retention trials were set at a limit of 180 s as cut off time.

in PBS. These sections were incubated for overnight
with appropriate antibodies. After washing in PBS, the
sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-mouse/
rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 hr at room temperature. The
sections were subsequently washed and incubated with
avidin-conjugated peroxidase complex (ABC kit, 1:200
dilution, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for
30 min followed by PBS washing. The peroxidase reaction
was performed in PBS using 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB, 0.02%) as the chromogen.
Finally, the sections were rinsed, mounted on polyglycine-coated slides, dehydrated, and cover-slipped
for light microscopy and photography. Finally, sections
were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and
mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific), and evaluated
on a light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For
Immunofluorescence, sections were incubated with an
anti-rabbit secondary antibody labeled with Alexa-Fluor
488 (1:400 dilution, Invitrogen) or anti-mouse secondary
antibody labeled with Alexa-Fluor 568 (1:400 dilution,
Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Final images
were viewed on a confocal LSM 510 Laser Scanning
microscope (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany).

Brain tissue collection and preservation
After behavioral tests, animals were perfused with
PBS under inhaled diethyl ether anesthetization. The
brains were immediately removed from skull, and the
cortex and hippocampus were dissected on ice. All the
brain tissues were immediately stored at −80 °C, until
biochemical assays were conducted.

Western blot analysis
Cells and each area of the brain tissue were
homogenized and lysed for 30 min incubation on ice.
The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15
min. An equal amount of total protein (20 µg) isolated
from brain tissues was resolved on an sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) 10 or 12 % polyacrylamide gel and then
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL;
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Blots were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with
5 % (w/v) non-fat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline
Tween-20 [TBST: 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and a 150 mM
NaCl solution containing 0.05 % Tween-20]. After a
short wash in TBST, membranes were incubated at room
temperature with specific. The blot was then incubated
with the corresponding conjugated anti-mouse or antirabbit antibodies (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting detection
system.

Measurement of Aβ1-42
Lysates of brain tissue were obtained through
protein extraction buffer containing protease inhibitor. Aβ1level was determined using each specific enzyme-linked
42
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit (Immuno-Biological
Laboratories Co., Ltd., Takasaki-Shi, Gunma, Japan). In
brief, 100 μl of sample was added into the precoated plate
and was incubated for overnight at 4 °C. After washing
each well of the precoated plate with washing buffer, 100
μl of labeled antibody solution was added and the mixture
was incubated for 1 hr at 4 °C in the dark. After washing,
chromogen was added and the mixture was incubated
for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the
resulting color was assayed at 450 nm using a microplate
absorbance reader (SunriseTM, TECAN, Switzerland)
after adding stop solution.

Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence

Measurement of β- and γ-secretase activities

After being anesthetized with diethyl ether,
subgroups of mice, were perfused intracardially with
50 ml saline. The brains were taken out from the skull
and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C.
The brains were transferred to 30 % sucrose solutions.
Subsequently, brains were cut into 18 μm sections using a
cryostat microtome (Leica CM1850; Leica Microsystems,
Seoul, South Korea). After multiple washings in PBS,
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by 1%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min and then
cleared in PBS for 5 min. The sections were blocked
for 30 min with 3% normal horse/goat serum diluted

β-Secretase activity in all mice brains was
determined using a commercially available β-secretase
activity kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and
a BACE1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay kit
(Panvera, Madison, WI, USA). Fluorescence was read at
excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 510 nm,
respectively, using a Fluostar Galaxy fluorimeter (BMG
Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany) with Felix
software (BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany).
β-Secretase activity is proportional to the fluorimetric

reaction and is expressed as nanomoles per milligram
protein per minute. γ-secretase activity was performed in
ex vitro using CHAPSO-solubilized membrane fractions.
Enzyme activity levels were quantified based on the
description by Farmery et al [53].

The data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism
version 4 program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego,
CA). Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. Satistical
significance was performed on the data using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) or unpaired Student’s t
test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Correlation analysis using the SNCID
Correlation analyses between 5-HT levels and
microarray genome-wide expression data in the frontal
cortex of individuals with major psychiatric diseases and
unaffected controls were conducted using the SNCID
(sncid.stanleyresearch.org/) as previously described (Kim
and Webster, 2010b). The SNCID is an archival and
mining database which includes numerous neuropathology
data, microarray data and RNA-seq data from the brain
tissues from subjects in the Stanley Neuropathology
Consortium. The Stanley Neuropathology Consortium
contains 15 well-matched cases in each of four groups:
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and
unaffected controls. The diagnostic groups are matched
for descriptive variables such as age, gender, race, postmortem interval (PMI), mRNA quality, brain pH, and
hemisphere. Demographic variables are listed in Table
2. DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) was
used to identify the pathways that were significantly overrepresented by the correlated genes. P-values less than
0.05 were considered significant.

The raw RNA sequencing data (FASTAQ files,
S1_Table) from the hippocampus of the Stanley
Neuropathology Consortium are also available from the
SNCID. The RNA-seq data from 15 depression cases
and 15 unaffected controls were downloaded for use in
this study. We map and quantify the RNA-seq data using
the same methods as described in our previous study. In
brief, all reads were mapped to the H. sapiens reference
genome using TopHat v2.0.0 with the UCSC refFlat gene
model annotation file (build hg18) on the -G parameter.
We used the expected mean inner distance between mate
paired-ends as -r parameter. TopHat calls Bowtie v0.12.7
to perform the alignment with no more than 2 mismatches.
The quantification of gene expression was accomplished
by HTseq v0.5.3p9 and edger package (http://www.
bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/html/edgeR.html).
All mapped read counts of the genes were counted by
htseq-count (subprogram of HTseq) with the UCSC refFlat
gene model annotation file, no strand specific option, and
intersection-nonempty option. We performed Pearson
correlation analysis between expression levels of 5-HT
receptor genes and the two APBA genes using R.
