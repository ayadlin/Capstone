ABSTRACT
Molecular mechanisms of lapatinib resistance in breast cancer are not well
understood. The aim of this study was to correlate expression of selected proteins
involved in ErbB family signaling pathways with clinical efficacy of lapatinib. Study
group included 270 HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients treated with
lapatinib and capecitabine. Immunohistochemical expression of phosphorylated
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein (p-AMPK), mitogen-activated protein
kinase (p-MAPK), phospho (p)-p70S6K, cyclin E, phosphatase and tensin homolog
were analyzed in primary breast cancer samples. The best discriminative value for
progression-free survival (PFS) was established for each biomarker and subjected
to multivariate analysis. At least one biomarker was determined in 199 patients.
Expression of p-p70S6K was independently associated with longer (HR 0.45; 95% CI:
0.25–0.81; p = 0.009), and cyclin E with shorter PFS (HR 1.83; 95% CI: 1.06–3.14;

p = 0.029). Expression of p-MAPK (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.13–2.29; p = 0.009) and
cyclin E (HR 2.99; 95% CI: 1.29–6.94; p = 0.011) was correlated with shorter, and
expression of estrogen receptor (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.43–0.98; p = 0.041) with longer
overall survival. Expression of p-AMPK negatively impacted response to treatment
(HR 3.31; 95% CI 1.48–7.44; p = 0.004) and disease control (HR 3.07; 95% CI
1.25–7.58; p = 0.015). In conclusion: the efficacy of lapatinib seems to be associated
with the activity of downstream signaling pathways – AMPK/mTOR and Ras/Raf/
MAPK. Further research is warranted to assess the clinical utility of these data and
to determine a potential role of combining lapatinib with MAPK pathway inhibitors.

the important signaling pathways associated with the
family of epidermal growth factor (ErbB) receptors:
phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein alpha 1 (p-AMPK-Ser486), the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (p-MAPK-T185 + Y187 + T202 + Y204),
phospho (p)-p70S6K, the hypoxia-inducible factor 2
alpha (HIF2 alpha), PTEN, and cyclin E. Their status was
retrospectively correlated with the clinical efficacy of
lapatinib. Our aim was to shed new light on the molecular
mechanisms involved in the resistance of breast cancer to
lapatinib.

INTRODUCTION
The introduction of trastuzumab, a monoclonal
antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor
2 receptor (HER2) has led to major improvement in the
treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer
[1–5]. The therapeutic mechanisms of trastuzumab
involve both the inhibition of HER2-dependent signaling
pathways and the engagement of immune responses via
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [6]. Despite
impressive clinical efficacy of trastuzumab, many
patients are refractory to this agent or develop secondary
resistance. The postulated mechanism of trastuzumab
resistance include the expression of the truncated-active
form of the HER2 receptor (p95HER2), the cross-talk
between HER2 and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor,
the deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homologue
deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and activating
mutations in the p110-alpha subunit of phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K), and activity of Rac1 – a Ras-like small
GTPase affecting trastuzumab-mediated endocytosis of
the HER2 receptor [7–19]. A small-molecule HER2 kinase
inhibitor – lapatinib entered the clinical practice later than
trastuzumab and has been mostly used as a second-line
therapy [20]. Due to its different mode of action, the
molecular resistance mechanisms of lapatinib can not
be simply extrapolated from those of trastuzumab [21,
22]. The resistance to this compound may be caused by
mechanisms occurring at various levels within a cancer
cell: the outer/inner leaflet of the plasma membrane,
cytoplasm or nucleus [14, 23–30]. Normally, activation of
growth factor-associated signaling cascades is initiated at
the plasma membrane in response to receptor activation
(homo-, or heterodimerization) [31]. Subsequently, the
signal is transmitted downstream towards the nucleus via
a signaling network, which comprises multiple kinases.
Signal transduction pathways in cancer cells may become
activated regardless of the receptor status. Spontaneously
activated signal transduction elements may be responsible
for resistance to receptor-targeted therapies, since crucial
pathways remain active despite receptor blockade.
Hence, the activity of signal transduction molecules may
potentially correlate with the resistance to lapatinib.
This study investigated the immunohistochemical
(IHC) expression of selected molecules involved in

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Tumor samples from 270 patients were subjected
to analysis, of which in 199 at least one biomarker was
determined (Figure 1, Table 1). Eighty-four percent of the
tumors were invasive ductal cancers (no special type),
67% were estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and 77%
progesterone receptor (PR)-negative. Eleven percent of
patients presented with metastatic disease at initial breast
cancer diagnosis. Radical surgery was performed in 91%
of patients; 98% received chemotherapy in (neo)adjuvant
and/or a metastatic setting, 36% received endocrine
therapy and all were administered trastuzumab in an
adjuvant or a metastatic setting, usually in combination
with chemotherapy. In 69% of patients, the first
manifestation of progression was distant metastasis, with
viscera being the most common dominant metastatic site.
Forty-three percent of patients developed brain metastases
during the course of their disease.

Clinical outcomes
The median duration of lapatinib and capecitabine
therapy was 6 months (range 0–52). In 82% of patients,
treatment was terminated due to disease progression.
Other reasons were toxicity (7%), patient refusal (2%),
death (3%), others (5%) and unknown (1%).
The best response to a combination of lapatinib and
capecitabine were CR (5%), PR (31%), stable disease
(42%) and progression (16%); in the remaining 6% of
patients response was unknown or not evaluated.

p = 0.015; Figure 4A–4B and Table 2), in addition to
regional vs. local type of first progression (HR 3.39;
95%CI 1.38–8.28; p = 0.008), whereas ERα expression
positively impacted OS (HR 0.60; 95%CI 0.39–0.92; p =
0.033; Figure 4C and Table 2). The significance of these
biomarkers was confirmed in the multivariate analysis
(Table 2).
The expression of p-AMPK alpha1 negatively
impacted response to treatment (HR 3.31; 95%CI 1.48–
7.44; p = 0.004) and disease control (HR 3.07; 95%CI
1.25–7.58; p = 0.015) in the multivariate analysis.
A subset analysis considering ER status showed
that p-MAPK expression in the ER-positive cohort was
associated with significantly shorter PFS (HR 3.14; 95%CI
1.59–6.20; p = 0.001) and OS (HR 2.53; 95%CI 1.05–
6.11; p = 0.038), whereas no such correlation was seen in
the ER-negative cohort (Table 3). Another biomarker with
adverse impact in the ER-positive cohort was HIF-2 alpha
(HR for OS 3.38; 95%CI 1.13–10.08; p = 0.029). In turn,
the expression p-p70S6K in the ER-positive cohort was
associated with longer PFS (HR 0.22; 95%CI 0.06–0.75;
p = 0.016; Table 3). The expression of cyclin E was more
common in the ER-negative cohort (p = 0.003) and in
this subset associated with shorter PFS (HR 1.78; 95%CI
1.02–3.09; p = 0.041) and OS (HR 2.38; 95%CI 1.09–
5.18; p = 0.029). No such impact of cyclin E was found
in the ER-positive subgroup. The significance of these
biomarkers was confirmed in the multivariate analysis.

The duration of follow-up from breast cancer
diagnosis varied from 6.7 to 242 months. The median
PFS from the start of lapatinib therapy was 6.2 months
(range 0–54). PFS was significantly longer in patients with
response to treatment (median 10.4 months; hazard ratio
[HR] 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35–0.56, p <
0.01) or disease control (median 8.1 months; HR 0.27;
95%CI 0.20–0.35; p < 0.01), compared to those with
refractory disease (median 2.3 months).
The status of p-AMPK alpha1, p-MAPK, p-p70S6K,
HIF-2 alpha, cyclin E and PTEN was determined in 176,
184, 190, 188, 180 and 176 cases, respectively (CONSORT
Diagram, Figure 1). The immunostained sections of
all studied proteins are shown on Figure 2. In all cases
staining was heterogeneous. For cyclin E the staining was
nuclear, for HIF-2 cytoplasmic and for p-AMPK alpha1,
p-MAPK, p-p70S6K, and PTEN nuclear and cytoplasmic.
Two of the examined biomarkers: p-p70S6K and cyclin
E proved predictive for PFS, with the best discriminating
H-scores of 10 and 200, respectively. The expression of
p-p70S6K (HR 0.47; 95%CI 0.26–0.86; p = 0.014) was
associated with longer, and the expression of cyclin E (HR
1.71; 95%CI 1.00–2.93; p = 0.05) with shorter PFS. The
predictive value of these two biomarkers was confirmed in
the multivariate analysis (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.25–0.81; p =
0.009 and 1.83; 95%CI 1.06–3.14; p = 0.029, respectively;
Figure 3A–3B and Table 2).
Negative prognostic factors for OS included the
expression of p-MAPK (HR 1.68; 95%CI 1.18–2.40;

tail of the tyrosine kinase receptor – mostly HER2 and
EGFR [34, 35]. Accordingly, the postulated mechanisms
underlying lapatinib resistance differs from those reported
for trastuzumab. Previous studies have shown up-regulated
ER-associated signaling genes, including FOXO3a and
caveolin-1, or Akt pathway transcripts (AKT1, MAPK9,
HSPCA, IRAK1, CCND1) in lapatinib resistant cells [36].
Other factors contributing to lapatinib resistance include
dominant activating mutations in PIK3CA, E545K and

Despite spectacular progress in the treatment
of HER2-positive breast cancer, overcoming primary
and acquired resistance to anti-HER2 agents remains
a critical challenge [32, 33]. In contrast to trastuzumab,
the anti-tumor activity of lapatinib is based solely on the
intracellular inhibition of cell-signaling by competing
with ATP for the ATP-binding domain in the cytoplasmic

H1047R or overexpression of AXL, a membrane-bound
tyrosine kinase receptor with resulting crosstalk between
HER, AXL and ER receptor pathways [37]. There are
two major signaling pathways controlled by receptors
belonging to the ErbB-receptors family – Ras/Raf/MAPK,
regulating cell division and proliferation, and PI3K/
Akt/mTOR, regulating cell growth and survival [38].
Hence, particular impairments in these pathways result
in improper activation of signaling cascades and may
influence the clinical efficacy of lapatinib [39, 40].
Our study suggests that another key element
involved in regulation of mTOR1 complex – phosporylated
AMPK alpha 1 protein kinase – may negatively impact
response to lapatinib. AMPK acts as a crucial regulator
of cell growth, proliferation and autophagy [41–42].
Intensive cellular energy-consuming processes, such
as glucose deprivation, hypoxia, oxidative stress,
hyperosmotic stress, or tissue ischemia, result in increased
concentration of AMP, which leads to AMPK activation.
Subsequently, activated AMPK, via phosphorylation of
raptor or TSC2, inhibits activity of mTORC1, leading
to general blockade of cellular anabolic processes and
simultaneously activating catabolic processes [43].
The direct phosphorylation of raptor by AMPK leads
to mTORC1 disruption and cell cycle arrest induced by
energy stress [44–47]. Alteration of mTOR signaling
networks, which is a common phenomenon in human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancers, may result from impairment of upstream
regulatory mechanisms [48].
We showed that p-70S6K phosphorylation,
reflecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity,
was associated with improved PFS in lapatinib-treated
patients, particularly in those with ER-positive tumors.
Phosphorylation of p-70S6K depends solely on the
activation of mTORC1, whereas p-70S6K exerts a
negative feedback loop that inhibits PI3K/Akt via IRS-1
[47]. It is possible, that the favorable impact of p70S6K
is associated with its inhibitory activity against various
(not only ErbB-family members) membrane receptor
complexes. However, a genuine predictive value of
p-70S6K for lapatinib would necessitate testing this
biomarker also in lapatinib-untreated patients, to exclude
its possible favorable prognostic impact shown previously
in early ERα-positive breast cancer [49]. In our study a
member of Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway – p-MAPK, appeared
to be a negative prognostic factor, mainly in patients with
ER-positive tumors. This may indicate that in advanced
HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with
lapatinib, phosphorylation of p-70S6K reflects significant
activity of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, particularly when
accompanied by p-AMPK up-regulation. However, since
p-MAPK is a distant downstream element of the Ras/Raf/
MAPK signaling pathway, its activity may result from
crosstalk with various distinct signaling pathways. This

observation may also suggest a potential role of combining
lapatinib with MAPK pathway inhibitors. Previous studies
have shown that, unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib affects cell
cycle kinetics through Ras/MAPK, and had less effect on
cell survival [14].
Our results suggest that the potential anti-tumor
role of AMPK activators, such as metformin, may be
limited in lapatinib-treated patients and requires further
research [50]. A phase I trial evaluating a combination of
lapatinib with metformin or sirolimus (mTOR inhibitor)
in advanced cancer patients is currently ongoing
(www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01087983). Similarly to
previous studies [14, 22], we have not found a correlation
between the PTEN status and clinical efficacy of lapatinib.
Indeed, the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
resulting from mutations of PIK3CA or loss/mutations of
PTEN has been attributed to the development of resistance
to trastuzumab [7–12, 14] but not to lapatinib [14, 22].
As expected, in this series a high expression of cell
cycle-regulating protein – cyclin E was more common in
the ER-negative tumors, and in this subset was associated
with apparently shorter PFS and OS. This biomarker was
earlier shown to confer a poor clinical outcome in breast
cancer [51]. Recent study demonstrated that cyclin E
levels decrease upon HER2 down-regulation and HER2
inhibition, suggesting that HER2 regulates cyclin E
function [52]. Finally, in a small group of HER2-positive
breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab-based
therapy, cyclin E amplification or overexpression was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

associated with significantly impaired clinical outcomes
[52]. Taken together, these data indicate that cyclin E
may represent another potential therapeutic target in
overcoming lapatinib resistance.
In our study expression of HIF-2 alpha was
associated with poor OS in the subset of ER-positive
tumors. HIF-2 alpha is a key regulatory factor in tumor
growth and its adverse prognostic impact has been
previously reported [53, 54].
Not surprisingly, our study showed impaired survival
in patients with ER-negative tumors. A negative prognostic
impact of ER-negativity in HER2-positive breast cancer
patients, was earlier reported by other authors [55, 56].
Indeed, the clinical behavior (including tumor kinetics and
sites of recurrence) of ER-positive/HER2 positive subtype
(HER2-positive luminal B breast cancer) differs from that
of ER-negative HER2 enriched subtype [55–58].
A recent study suggested that the clinical benefit
of first-line trastuzumab in advanced breast cancer may
be predictive for the efficacy of second- and later lines of
anti-HER2 therapies [59]. As our series included patients
exposed to trastuzumab in both adjuvant and metastatic
setting, we were unable to include this variable in the
analysis.
In conclusion, our study suggests that the clinical
efficacy of lapatinib may be associated with the activity
of downstream signaling pathways – AMPK/mTOR and
Ras/Raf/MAPK. These data may indicate a potential role
of combining lapatinib with MAPK pathway inhibitors

and justify further research on combinations of lapatinib
with mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus. We are aware
of several limitations of this study. First, our investigations
included only downstream signaling pathways, and not
the underlying molecular alterations. Second, although
our series was homogeneous, i.e. all patients were treated
with lapatinib and capecitabine, a nonrandomized study
design did not allow to test the predictive value of particular
markers. Notably, a proportion of samples was excluded
from analysis due to analytical problems, and there was no
lapatinib-untreated control group. Finally, this analysis used
material obtained from the primary tumor, whereas several
studies showed phenotypic instability of metastatic sites,
particularly in relation to hormone receptors [60, 61]. The
question of whether biomarkers analyzed in this study are
also a subject of such conversions, and whether this impacts
response to lapatinib, remains to be answered. Hence, these
results should be considered preliminary and only hypothesis
generating. Further investigations are warranted to verify the
clinical utility of our findings.

Medicine in Warsaw, Poland). An initial study population
included HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients
treated in 31 oncology centers in Poland, Hungary, Czech
Republic, Lithuania and Romania between 2004 and
2013. The patients should have received a combination
of lapatinib at an initial dose of 1250 mg per day
continuously and capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg/m2
of body-surface area on days 1 through to 14 of a 21day cycle for at least 6 weeks. Patients must have earlier
received trastuzumab and 1–3 lines of chemotherapy for
advanced disease. Other eligibility criteria included age
above 18 years, no previous or concomitant malignant
disease except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
tumor lesions evaluable for therapeutic response to
lapatinib and the availability of formalin-fixed, paraffin
embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimens for analysis.
The following information was extracted from the medical
records: the date of breast cancer diagnosis, previous
local and systemic therapy, the date and type of the first
progression (local, regional, distant), the dominant site of
metastatic disease (soft tissue, bone, viscera), the date of
brain metastasis diagnosis, the dates on which lapatinib
and capecitabine were administered, the date of the first
progression while on lapatinib and capecitabine therapy,
and the date of death or the last follow-up visit. For tumors
involving more than one category, the dominant site of

PFS: progression free survival; OS: overall survival; ER: estrogen receptor; N: number of cases
with the worst prognosis, irrespective of the extent of
involvement, in the following order of increasing gravity:
soft tissue, bones, and viscera. Due to the retrospective
nature of this study, tumor staging was performed using
the American Joint Committee on Cancer/the Union for
International Cancer Control classification from 1997.
Follow-up information was extracted from medical
records and tumor registries. All data were coded to secure
full protection of personal information. Alive patients
had to provide written informed consent for the use of
their archival tumor samples for analysis, according to
regulations in particular countries.

sufficient invasive breast cancer component was present
(1 cm2 invasive tissue; ≥ 30% tumor cells). In each case,
assuming potential intratumoral heterogeneity, 2 tissue
cores (1.5 mm in diameter) were punched out from the
FFPE tissue blocks containing primary breast cancer
(“donor”) and transferred into a “recipient” paraffin block
using Manual Tissue MicroArrayer (MTA I, Beecher
Instrument Inc.) A total of 10 tissue microarrays (TMAs)
were constructed.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
IHC analysis was performed in tumor tissue in
accordance with standard protocols, on 5 μm histological
slides derived from the TMA blocks. The tumor-associated
stromal cells were not analyzed. The staining was performed
according to manufactures’ protocols with the use of the
following antibodies: p-AMPK alpha1 (ab39400 rabbit
polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; dilution 1:300),
p-MAPK (ab50011 mouse monoclonal, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK; dilution 1:100), p-p70S6K (ab32359 rabbit monoclonal,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK; dilution 1:25), HIF2alpha

Pathology
The starting material from each patient was an
archival formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)
specimen(s) from the primary breast cancer obtained at
surgery or by tissue biopsy. A pre-cut section of each
tumor, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, was reviewed
by two board-certified pathologists (WB and KK) to
confirm breast cancer diagnosis and determine whether a

dilution 1:250), cyclin E (HE12 mouse monoclonal, Thermo
Sci, Waltham, MA, USA; dilution 1:50) and PTEN (6H2.1
mouse monoclonal, DAKO Denmark; dilution 1:100).
Positive controls were used according to manufacturer's
recommendations and negative controls included standard
staining procedures with the omitting of the primary
antibody step. TMA sections were deparaffinized in xylene
and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval
procedure was performed using Target Retrieval Solution,
with pH depending on monoclonal antibody in electric
pressure cooker, followed by 20 min cooling before further
immunostaining. Endogenous reactivity was blocked with
normal goat serum. Following the preliminary stages,
incubation with the primary antibody was carried out for
30 minutes. The binding of the monoclonal antibody was
detected with biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled
avidin – biotin complex. IHC stains were scored manually
according to staining intensity (0 – negative, 1 – weak,
2 – moderate, 3 – strong) and the percentage of positive
tumor cells. Each tissue core was assessed separately and
the core with the highest staining intensity was considered
representative for the particular case. To accurately describe
the extent of immunohistochemical staining of a tumor
and to potentially increase the predictive information,
expression of particular biomarkers was assessed using
the staining H-score. The H-score was calculated for each
biomarker by the formula: 3 x percentage of strong cellular
(cytoplasmic or nuclear wherever appropriate) staining plus
2 x percentage of moderate cellular staining plus percentage
of weak cellular staining, giving a range of 0 to 300. The
cutoff values for each biomarker were optimized using Cox
regression model to maximize the hazard ratio (HR) between
patients with expression levels above vs. below the cutoff.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

All statistical analyses were performed using STATA
software version 11. Statistical significance was defined
as p < 0.05. Categorical variables were compared using
Pearson’s chi-squared test (χ2) and Spearman’s R rang.
The primary endpoint was progression free survival
(PFS), defined as the time from the date of the lapatinib
start to the date of the disease progression or death,
whichever occurred first. The secondary endpoints were an
objective response, defined as a complete response (CR) or
a partial response (PR) and disease control, defined as CR,
PR and stable disease combined, determined according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
v 1.0 criteria. Survival curves were plotted using the
Kaplan-Meier method, starting from the first day of
lapatinib therapy to the date of death or the last follow-up.
Univariate analyses were performed with a log-rank test,
Wilcoxon test and Cox proportional hazard and logistic
regression. Multivariate analysis used a stepwise forward
selection of univariate model with p ≤ 0.10.
