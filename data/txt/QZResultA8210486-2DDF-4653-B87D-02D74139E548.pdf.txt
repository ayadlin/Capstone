BACKGROUND: The aim of this phase 2 study was to determine the long-term local control, survival, and late toxicities
among patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT) with the simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy (SMART) boost technique and concurrent chemotherapy. METHODS: Eighty-one patients with pathologically diagnosed locally advanced NPC were enrolled in this
study. IMRT was delivered with the SMART boost technique at prescribed doses of 68 grays (Gy)/30 fraction to the nasopharynx gross target volume. Concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy (80 mg/m2/d on Days 1 and 22) was administered.
RESULTS: The mean actual physical dose delivered to the nasopharynx gross target volume was 73.8 Gy, and the mean
biologically effective dose (BED) for the nasopharynx gross target volume was 84.8 Gy. With a median follow-up of
54 months, 4 (4.9%) patients experienced local recurrence. The 5-year local control rate was 94.9%. Eighteen
patients died. Among them, 66.7% died of distant metastasis. The 5-year disease-free and overall survivals were
76.7% and 74.5%, respectively. The most common late toxicities among 68 patients with 4 years follow-up were
grade 1-2 xerostomia, hearing loss, skin dystrophy, and subcutaneous fibrosis. No grade 4 late toxicities were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with SMART to enhance BED and concurrent chemotherapy is feasible in patients with locally
advanced NPC. Long-term results showed excellent local control with fewer late toxicities, although no further improvement was noted in overall survival, and the major cause of death was distant metastasis. Exploration of more effective

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique type of head and neck cancer in terms of epidemiology, method of
treatment, and prognosis1,2 that is particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia.3 This tumor is radiosensitive; however, conventional 2-dimensional (2D) radiotherapy (RT) is associated with high rates of local recurrence, especially in patients with locally
advanced NPC.4-6 The 5-year local control rate among patients with T3/T4 disease ranged from 69% to 79%.4,6-11
Local control of NPC is highly correlated with the total radiation dose delivered to the tumor12-14 and overall treatment time.15-17 Different strategies have been used to increase the local control of disease in patients with locally advanced
NPC in the era of 2D RT, 1 of which is to increase the physical dose to the tumor, as with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
or brachytherapy after external beam radiation, which may yield better treatment outcomes. But this is not always suitable
for all patients with advanced TNM classification tumors.18,19 Another option is to increase the biologic dose to the tumor

by accelerated fractionation, in which multiple fractions
per day or 6 fractions per week are administered.20 However, those methods cause severe acute toxicity and even
an increased incidence of late complications without
obvious survival benefit.18-23 Because of the presence of
several critical organs around the nasopharynx, including
the brainstem, spinal cord, orbits, and parotid glands, prescribing an excessive dose can result in significant complications, lowering patients’ quality of life.24 Thus,
radiotherapy for patients with NPC has been a challenge
for radiation oncologists.
Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is relatively a new technique that facilitates the delivery of high
radiation doses to the target while sparing the adjacent
organs.25-28 In theory, dose escalation with IMRT should
increase local control and thus improve survival in
patients with NPC. Another development in the field of
head and neck cancer treatment is simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy (SMART).29 This
facilitates the delivery of conventional radiotherapy to a
large area, including the primary tumor and regional
nodes, while a small volume dose boost is delivered to the
sites of gross disease.30 This approach has been reported
to increase the biologically effective dose (BED) delivered
to the tumor target by elevating the total and fractionated
doses and to also shorten the course of treatment.29,30
Several reports have been published concerning the
use of IMRT with SMART boost techniques for the treatment of NPC.31-37 Although all studies reported have
yielded relatively better survivals and mild toxicities, the
maximum median follow-up duration was only 35
months.36 Hence, the longer-term results and late toxicities associated with this type of treatment are yet to be
reported. Given this, the aim of our study was to determine the long-term local control, survival, and late toxicities of IMRT with the SMART boost technique
delivered at our dose scheme and combined with concurrent chemotherapy for treatment of locally advanced
NPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients who fulfilled all of the following criteria were eligible for participation in this study: (1) histologically confirmed NPC by biopsy, (2) no evidence of distant
metastasis, (3) no previous treatment for NPC, (4) T34N0-1M0 disease according to the staging system of the
1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/

adequate liver function, (6) adequate renal function, (7)
adequate bone marrow function, and (8) Karnofsky performance status 80. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of distant metastases, (2) pregnancy or
lactation, and (3) previous malignancy or other concomitant malignant disease.
Pretreatment Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete history and
physical examination with nasopharyngoscopy, chest radiography, ultrasonography of the abdominal region, and
hematologic and biochemical profiles. Additional investigations were performed if indicated. Contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CT) of the nasopharyngeal
region and neck were performed to determine stage. The
disease was staged according to the 1997 AJCC/UICC
staging classifications.
Radiotherapy Protocol
Radiation was delivered with a linear accelerator (Varian,
Palo Alto, Calif) using 6 MV photons. IMRT was delivered with a dynamic multileaf intensity-modulating collimator (NOMOS Corporation, Sewickley, Pa) by a sliceby-slice arc rotation approach. The gantry rotation arc
was 105 to 255 , and beamlet patterns changed every 5 .
In our protocol, primary tumors and the upper neck
above the cricoid cartilage (including levels II, III, and
Va) were treated with IMRT by the SMART boost technique, whereas the lower neck (including levels IV and
Vb) and the supraclavicular fossae were treated with a single anterior split field by conventional RT. These 2 fields
were matched with a split-beam technique to avoid potential dose overlap. Conventional RT to the lower neck and
the supraclavicular fossae was performed after the completion of IMRT each day. Verification of the setup and dose
was performed before treatment delivery. The location of
the planned treatment was verified weekly with check
films to ensure the accuracy of the setup during the course
of treatment.
Patient Immobilization and CT Simulation
Patients were placed in the supine position and immobilized from head to neck with a thermoplastic mask. CT
simulation (Plus 4, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was
performed with a slice thickness of 3 mm extending from
the vertex to 2 cm below the clavicle. Both control CT
(for the dose calculation) and contrast-enhanced CT (for
the target delineation) images were obtained and

transferred to the treatment-planning system, an inverse
planning system (CORVUS 3.0/3.2, Peacock plan) developed by NOMOS Corporation.
Target Delineation and Dose Prescription
All target volumes were outlined slice by slice on the
axial contrast-enhanced CT images in the treatmentplanning system. The target volumes were defined in accordance with the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Reports 50 and 62.39,40
Gross tumor volume was determined according to diagnostic CT and physical examination. The nasopharynx
gross target volume and the positive neck lymph nodes
were identified. Two clinical target volumes (CTVs)
were delineated: CTV1 and CTV2. CTV1 was defined
as the nasopharynx gross target volume plus a 5 to 10
mm margin (2 to 3 mm margin posteriorly) to encompass the high-risk sites of microscopic extension and the
whole nasopharynx. CTV2 was defined as the CTV1
plus a 5 to 10 mm margin (2 to 3 mm margin posteriorly) to encompass the low-risk sites of microscopic
extension, the level of the lymph node located, and the
elective neck area (bilateral levels IIa, IIb, III, and Va
are routinely covered for all N0 patients, whereas ipsilateral levels IV, Vb, or supraclavicular fossae were also
included for N1 patients). Planning target volumes for
all gross tumor volumes and CTVs were generated automatically after delineation of tumor targets according to
the immobilization and localization uncertainties. The
prescribed dose was 68 grays (Gy)/30 fraction to the
nasopharynx gross target volume, 60 to 66 Gy/30 fraction to the positive neck lymph nodes, and 60 Gy/30
fraction to the CTV1; 54 Gy/30 fraction was given to
the CTV2 to guarantee that the fraction dose was 1.8
Gy. In addition, the prescribed dose to the lower neck
and the supraclavicular fossae by irradiation with the
conventional RT technique was 50 Gy/25 fraction for
prophylactic intent, and 60 to 66 Gy/30 to 33 fraction
for therapeutic intent.
All of the critical adjacent structures, including the
brainstem, spinal cord, temporal lobe, lens, optic nerves
and chiasm, parotid glands, temporomandibular joints
(TMJs), and mandible, were carefully outlined. The doses to
these structures were reduced as much as possible, without
sacrificing coverage of the tumor target. The ability to spare
these structures depended on the extent and location of the
tumor. The maximum doses to these structures were restricted so as not to exceed their tolerance doses, which were
as follows: 56 Gy for brainstem; 45 Gy for spinal cord; 60

1876

Gy for temporal lobes; 5 Gy for lens; 50 Gy for optic nerves,
chiasm, TMJs, and mandible; and 40 Gy for parotids.
Planning Evaluation
The plan was approved upon meeting the criteria
described hereafter. The plan was accepted if: (1) the prescribed dose encompassed at least 95% of the target volume; (2) no greater than 1% of nasopharynx gross target
volume could receive 93% of the prescribed dose; (3)
the maximum dose point was located in the nasopharynx
gross target volume; and (4) the isodoses were normalized
to the maximum dose, and the isodose chosen for prescription to the nasopharynx gross target volume was at
least 80% of the maximum dose. For the critical organs
with functional subunits organized in series, the dose to
5% of the volume (D5) could not exceed their tolerance
doses. Because only the cervical portion of the spinal cord
was included in the treatment volume, we determined
that the maximum dose delivered to 1 mL of the spinal
cord could not exceed 45 Gy. For the critical organs with
functional subunits organized in parallel, the dose constraints to 33% of the volume were less than their tolerance doses. Homogeneity was not used as the evaluable
criterion. Figure 1 shows an example of an IMRT plan
used for a patient with NPC classified as T3N1M0.
Chemotherapy Protocol
All patients received concurrent chemotherapy during
radiotherapy. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin alone (80 mg/m2/d, intravenous infusion over 2
hours on Days 1 and 22).
We chose this dose and schedule of cisplatin when
designing this study for the following reasons. First,
although concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy has been considered standard practice in North America on the basis of the results of the
IGS-0099 trial,41 it was still unclear whether these results,
which were derived from patients of heterogeneous histologic types, could be directly applied to patients with
World Health Organization (WHO) subtype III undifferentiated NPC (in endemic areas such as Southern China,
the proportion of patients with WHO subtype III histology is >90%). Second, concurrent chemotherapy with
100 mg/m2 cisplatin for 3 cycles and adjuvant chemotherapy caused acute and subacute toxicities, including nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, electrolyte imbalance, weight
loss, leukopenia, and hearing impairment in IGS-0099.41
The patients’ compliance to the IGS-0099 regimen was
not ideal, with only 63% and 55% of the patients

completing 3 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy and 3
cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. Finally, 30
fractions of our SMART boost IMRT could be finished
in 42 days; therefore, the third cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was omitted.
Patient Evaluation and Follow-Up
All patients were evaluated at least once a week during the
radiotherapy. The first assessment of tumor response was
performed 1 month after the completion of radiotherapy
by physical examination and flexible nasopharyngoscopy.
This was followed by contrast-enhanced CT of the head
and neck 3 months after radiotherapy. Then patients were
followed up every 3 months from 3 months through 3
years, and every 1 year thereafter. During every follow-up
visit, disease status and treatment toxicity were assessed.

May 1, 2011

Complete physical and fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy or
indirect nasopharyngeal speculum examinations were performed. Biochemistry profiles, chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and CT of the nasopharynx and
cervical region were routine elements of the assessment.
Further investigations were arranged as indicated. Management of residual disease and tumor relapse, if detected,
was determined on a case-by-case basis.
Statistical Methods
Dose-volume histograms were constructed to calculate
dosimetric indices of the target volumes and critical
organs. The physical dose for the nasopharynx gross target
volume was translated into BED according to the linearquadratic model, BED ¼ D(1 þ d/[a/b])  k(T  Tk),
where D stands for total dose, d for dose per fraction, T

for overall treatment time, and Tk for accelerated repopulation after a kick-in time.42-45 The endpoints of this
study included the local control rate, disease-free survival
(DSS), overall survival (OS), and late toxicity.
Durations were calculated from the end of treatment. All of the analyses were performed on an intentionto-treat basis. Local control rate and survival estimations
were determined by the method of Kaplan and Meier.46
The late toxicities were graded according to the Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring
criteria.47

On the basis of previous experience, the 5-year local
control rate among patients with T3-T4 NPC treated
with conventional 2D RT alone was about 70%.6,8-11
Therefore, we assumed that our treatment regimen would
increase the local control rate to 90%. For a significance
level of.05 with power equal to 80%, a minimum sample
size of 77 patients was determined.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From September 2001 to October 2005, a total of 81 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. As this trial was
initiated in January 2001, patients were initially staged
according to the 1997 AJCC/UICC system in our protocol. After the publication of the 2002 AJCC/UICC system,48,49 all of the enrolled patients were restaged
according to the 2002 AJCC/UICC criteria. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) was available from March 2003
in our cancer center. Patients enrolled after that date had
their tumors staged, tumor volumes determined, and
responses evaluated according to the images obtained by
both CT and MRI. A portion of patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) before initiation of
treatment. The demographic and clinical characteristics of
the patients are shown in Table 1.

We assumed a/b ¼ 10 for the tumor, Tk ¼ 28 days,
and k ¼ 0.6 Gy/d for a rapidly repopulating tumor; the
required T was 40 days for our SMART boost IMRT protocol, assuming that treatment was commenced on Monday. The mean BED of the nasopharynx gross target
volume for the entire series of patients was 84.8 Gy
(range, 79.0-90.5 Gy).
The IMRT plans resulted in significant sparing of the
critical normal structures: the D5 values for the brainstem,
optic chiasm, and right and left optic nerves were 48.6,
35.8, 42.0, and 44.1 Gy, respectively. The maximum dose
delivered to 1 mL of the cervical spinal cord was 40.9 Gy.
The dose constraints to 33% of the volume values of the left
and right parotid glands and left and right TMJs were 37.2,
38.3, 38.2, and 37.4 Gy, respectively.
Local Control and Survival
All patients received the entire course of radiotherapy and
chemotherapy according our protocol and were regularly
followed up until death or December 31, 2009. The median duration of observation was 54 months (range, 6-87
months).
At the time of the analysis, treatment failure was apparent in 20 patients. Four (20%) of these patients experienced local recurrence, 2 (10%) had regional recurrence,
and 14 (70%) developed distant metastasis. Of the 4
patients who suffered local recurrence, 1 patient presented
with T3 disease, and 3 patients presented with T4 disease;
all local recurrences were in-field failures within the nasopharynx gross target volume. The intervals between the
treatment and local failure for the 4 patients were 4, 9, 18,
and 37 months after completion of radiotherapy, respectively. The 3- and 5-year local control rate rates were 94.9%
and 94.9%, respectively. Eighteen patients died. Among

them, 12 (66.7%) and 3 (16.7%) patients died because of
distant metastasis and local recurrence, respectively. The 3
remaining patients died because of chemotherapy toxicity
after distant metastasis (5.6%), another malignancy (5.6%),
and cardiac disease (5.6%), respectively. The DSS and OS
rates were 88.8% and 87.7% at 3 years, and 76.7% and
74.5% at 5 years, respectively.
Late Toxicities
Late toxicities were assessed in 68 patients with 4 years
follow-up. The results are depicted in Table 3. The most
common late toxicities were grade 1-2 skin dystrophy,
subcutaneous fibrosis, hearing loss, and xerostomia. Only
1 patient had grade 3 subcutaneous fibrosis. No patient
had grade 4 late toxicity. Xerostomia appeared to decrease
with time after treatment. The number of patients with
grade 2-3 xerostomia decreased gradually, whereas the
number of patients with grade 0-1 xerostomia increased
in the follow-up period, as shown in Figure 2. Grade 2-3
trismus was not noted. The mean distances of mouth

4.21, 4.27, 4.19, and 4.17 cm, respectively. The maximum vertical dimension was <3 cm in only 5 patients at
4 years after radiotherapy. For these 5 patients, the maximum vertical dimension gradually decreased from pretreatment values of >3 cm to <3 cm after treatment.
Three patients had neuropathy. Two of these patients
exhibited injury to the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal (V1) nerve and the maxillary division of the trigeminal
(V2) nerve before the initiation of radiotherapy. The
symptoms improved at the end of treatment and
remained stable during follow-up. The other patient
(with T3N0M0 disease) presented with V2 nerve injury 3
years after treatment. Eleven patients (a total of 13 sides of
the temporal lobes) suffered temporal lobar injuries, and
1 patient had brainstem injury after radiotherapy. All of
these 12 patients had primary bulky tumors with extensive
skull base and intracranial tissue invasion. Among the 11
patients with temporal lobar injury, 7 patients were
asymptomatic, and 2 patients suffered from mild symptoms, with unsteady gait in 1 patient and sensation of
numbness in the upper limb in the other.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have reported the first long-term results
from a prospective phase 2 clinical trial in which patients
with locally advanced NPC received IMRT with the
SMART boost technique and concurrent chemotherapy. In

1880

this study, dose escalation and accelerated fractionation
could be achieved with a single IMRT plan. On average, a
mean nasopharynx gross target volume dose of 73.8 Gy was
given in 30 fractions over 6 weeks, which enabled escalation
of the mean BED for nasopharynx gross target volume to
84.8 Gy. Compared with conventional radiotherapy with
or without chemotherapy,4,7,32,47,50,51 a 5% to 10%
increase in tumor dose was administered. The fraction dose
to nasopharynx gross target volume was increased to 2.46
Gy, and the overall treatment time was shortened by 1.5
weeks. With a median follow-up of 54 months, a preferable
clinical efficacy with fewer late toxicities was confirmed for
our escalation of the BED of nasopharynx gross target volume by SMART boost IMRT combined with concurrent
chemotherapy. The 5-year local control rate was 94.9%.
The most common late toxicities were grades 1-2. No grade
4 late toxicities were noted.
Over the last decade, there have been several reports
published concerning the use of IMRT with SMART
boost techniques for the treatment of patients with
NPC.28,31-33,36 However, the dose schemes were all different (the details of these studies are summarized in Table
4).31,34,35,37,52-56 Compared with these studies, the total
physical dose to nasopharynx gross target volume of our
study is similar to that in the report by Lee et al56; higher
than the dose used in the studies reported by Kam et al,55
Lee et al,31 Wu et al,52 Koom et al,34 and Lin et al37; and
obviously lower than the dose used by Kwong et al.35 The
total number of fractions in the current study is the same
as that reported by Lee et al,31 more than those reported
by Wu et al52 and Koom et al,34 and less than those

reported by all others. After we transformed the physical
dose into BED, we found that the BED of nasopharynx
gross target volume in our series was higher, similar to the
BEDs in Kwong et al’s series,35 which were 84.8 Gy and
86.1 Gy, respectively, whereas the BEDs reported by
other authors ranged from only 73.2 Gy to 82.1 Gy. In
addition, it seems that the short-term results reported in
those series were all quite good. However, only patients
with advanced TNM classification were enrolled in our
study and that of Kwong et al,35 whereas the outcomes
reported by others were based on patients with disease
exclusively in nonmetastatic stages (stages I-IVb). Furthermore, a majority of the studies integrate other techniques to boost after IMRT, such as brachytherapy,37,54,56
SRS,35 3D RT, and IMRT.28,52,54 Considering all the
above factors, the local control in our study is quite satisfactory, with 3- and 5-year local control rates of 94.9%.
This implies that IMRT with the SMART boost technique using our dose scheme to enhance the BED of nasopharynx gross target volume may be a better choice to
improve the local control of disease for patients with
advanced TNM classification NPC.
Accurate definition of targets may also account for
the satisfactory local control. In this study, both CT and
MRI images were obtained for 37% of the patients,
whereas 54% of the patients received CT, MRI, and PET
before treatment. The pattern of primary tumor recurrences, with all confined to the region of nasopharynx
gross target volume, suggests that combining the results of
multiple imaging examinations will improve the accuracy
of target definition.
Although all patients in our study received concurrent
chemotherapy, the 5-year DSS and OS were only 76.7%
and 74.5%, respectively, and distant metastasis was the
major cause of death in patients after treatment. Adequate
chemotherapy has been shown by clinical trial and metaanalysis to decrease local/distant failure and improve the
survival of patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.41,57
Compared with trials IGS-0099, NPC-9901, and NPC9902,41,50,58 the number of cycles of concurrent chemotherapy in our study was reduced to 2, and the dose was
reduced to 80 mg/m2. Therefore, we speculate that the limited chemotherapy used in this trial is quite likely to be the
reason for the less-than-satisfactory OS rate. Although the
local control of disease in patients with advanced TNM classification NPC is quite satisfactory now with the utilization
of the IMRT technique, the approach to further reductions
in the rate of distant metastasis remains a huge challenge.
Chitapanarux et al reported that 206 patients with locore-

Cancer

gionally advanced NPC were randomized to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin plus adjuvant
chemotherapy or standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy
with cisplatin plus adjuvant chemotherapy.59 Although the
compliance of patients in the carboplatin group was better,
no significant difference was noticed in treatment efficacy
between these 2 arms. The phase 2 clinical trial of Hui et al
comparing the toxicities, tumor control, survival, and quality of life of patients with NPC treated with neoadjuvant
docetaxel chemotherapy followed by concurrent cisplatinradiotherapy or concurrent cisplatin-radiotherapy alone60
revealed that the 3-year OS of the patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus concurrent chemotherapy was
much higher than that among the concurrent chemotherapy
group (94.1% vs 67.7%), suggesting a positive impact on
patients’ survival. Further research exploring more efficacious multimodal therapy strategies that incorporate different chemotherapy regimens and new chemotherapeutic
agents is warranted.
In the current study, we observed a few significant late
toxicities. The most common late toxicities were of grades 1
and 2 among 68 patients over 4 years of follow-up. Only
1 patient had grade 3 toxicity, and no patient had grade 4
toxicity. The lower incidence of deafness, eyeball damage,
trismus, bone necrosis, dysphagia, and xerostomia in our
current cohort was especially dramatic compared with the
long-term toxicities in previous retrospective and prospective investigations.32,50,51 As was reported in other studies,37,55,56 xerostomia appeared to decrease with time after
treatment. Except for a small number of patients, the function of the TMJs was rarely affected, and the incidence of
trismus was quite low. All these results suggest that SMART
boost IMRT with our fractionation scheme obviously restricted the dose delivered to the normal tissue around the
tumor in patients with locally advanced disease and, thus,
resulted in decreased rates of severe late toxicities.
It is worthwhile to note that several temporal lobe and
brainstem injuries were detected in our study; these injuries
may be the result of extensive invasion of the skull base and
even intracranial tissue, which led to increased doses to the
temporal lobes and brainstem. Although the damage to the
temporal lobes and brainstem was not extremely severe, further study is still very crucial and indispensable to achieve
sufficient irradiation doses to the tumor while protecting
normal organs in patients with late stage disease.
Conclusions
In this study, we have described the long-term outcomes
for patients with advanced local NPC who underwent

Original Article

IMRT with the SMART boost technique. Both the dosimetric and clinical findings demonstrated the capacity of
our SMART boost scheme to protect normal tissue, with
fewer late toxicities through its superior dose distribution,
and to enhance BED to nasopharynx gross target volume,
combined with concurrent chemotherapy to improve
long-term local control rates. Further research is necessary
to decrease the dose given to the temporal lobes and brainstem in patients with late TNM classification disease and
with tumors that extensively invade the base of the skull
and intracranial tissue. However, no further improvement
was noted in OS, and distant metastasis was the major
cause of treatment failure in our study. New strategies
combining different treatment modalities to reduce the
rate of distant metastasis effectively need to be developed
in the future.
