ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
The arachidonic acid (AA) pathway and linoleic acid (LA) pathway have been implicated
as important contributors to CRC development and growth. Human 15-lipoxygenase 1
(15-LOX-1) converts LA to anti-tumor 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE)
and 15-LOX-2 converts AA to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). In addition,
human 12-LOX metabolizes AA to pro-tumor 12-HETE. In rodents, the function of 12LOX and 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 is carried out by a single enzyme, 12/15-LOX. As a
result, conflicting conclusions concerning the role of 12-LOX and 15-LOX have been
obtained in animal studies. In the present studies, we determined that PD146176,
a selective 15-LOX-1 inhibitor, markedly suppressed 13-HODE generation in human
colon cancer HCA-7 cells and HCA-7 tumors, in association with increased tumor
growth. In contrast, PD146176 treatment led to decreases in 12-HETE generation in
mouse colon cancer MC38 cells and MC38 tumors, in association with tumor inhibition.
Surprisingly, deletion of host 12/15-LOX alone led to increased MC38 tumor growth, in
association with decreased tumor 13-HODE levels, possibly due to inhibition of 12/15LOX activity in stroma. Therefore, the effect of 12/15-LOX on colorectal tumorigenesis
in mouse models could be affected by tumor cell type (human or mouse), relative
12/15 LOX activity in tumor cells and stroma as well as the relative tumor 13-HODE
and 12-HETE levels.

INTRODUCTION

the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, the lipoxygenase
(LOX) pathway, and the cytochrome P450 pathway.
The cyclooxygenase pathway generates prostanoids,
including prostaglandins (PGEs) and thromboxane;
the lipoxygenase pathway produces leukotrienes and
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). In the cytochrome
P450 pathway, AA is metabolized to epoxyeicosatrienoic
acids and HETEs by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases and

Arachidonic acid (AA), a polyunsaturated
omega-6 fatty acid, is a component of the phospholipid
domain of most cell membranes[1]. AA is cleaved from
membrane phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A2
and metabolized to eicosanoids by three main pathways:

cytochrome P450 ω-hydroxylases, respectively.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most
preventable cancers; however it is still the leading
cause of cancer death. The arachidonic acid pathway
has been implicated as an important contributor to CRC
development and growth. Arachidonic acid metabolites
derived from the cyclooxygenase, the LOX or the
cytochrome P450 pathway have all been implicated in
colorectal tumorigenesis[2-4]. COX-derived PGE2 is the
major prostanoids to promote colorectal tumorigenesis[5].
However, both 5-LOX-derived leukotrienes and
5-HETE have also been implicated in colorectal
tumorigenesis[6-10]. Either genetic or pharmacologic
inhibition of 5-LOX pathway suppresses colorectal
tumorigenesis in murine models[3, 8-11].
In addition to 5-LOX, humans have other two major
LOX isoforms: 12-LOX, and 15-LOX. 12-LOX and
its metabolite 12-HETE have been reported to promote
tumorigenesis and metastasis by inhibiting apoptosis,
stimulating cell proliferation, angiogenesis, interactions
between tumor cell and vasculature, tumor cell mobility,
invasion and proteolysis[12]. Polymorphism (Arg261Gln)
in the 12-LOX gene has been associated with a reduced
risk of colorectal adenoma[13]. In humans, 15-LOX
exists as two isozymes, 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2.
The preferred substrate for 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX2 are linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, respectively.
15-LOX-1 and its linoleic acid metabolite, 13-HODE
(13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid), are decreased
in human colon cancer[14, 15]. 13-S-HODE inhibits
cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer
cells[16].
In rodents, there are not separate 12-LOX and
15-LOX enzymes. Instead, 12/15-LOX in rodents
functions as both 12-LOX and 15-LOX. Rodent 12/15LOX can metabolizes arachidonic acid to 12-HETE and
15-HETE and linoleic acid to 13-HODE. Due to this
special property of 12/15-LOX in rodents, information
about its role in tumorigenesis in mouse models is
limited and controversial. 12/15-LOX has been reported
to promote prostate carcinoma progression[17] and to
mediate invasion of intrametastatic lymphatic vessels
and propagate lymph node metastasis in a mouse model
of mammary carcinoma[18]. However, overexpression
of 15-LOX-1 in intestinal epithelial cells inhibited
colonic tumorigenesis in mice[19]. Using mouse and
human colorectal tumor models as well as genetic and
pharmacologic inhibition of LOX activity, we determined
that the effect of inhibition of LOX activity on colorectal
tumorigenesis depends on LOX-derived metabolites in
both the tumor cells and the host stroma.

Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of LOX
activity had differential effects on murine and
human colorectal tumorigenesis
The effect of 15-LOX on tumorigenesis is limited
and controversial[17-19]. To investigate the potential role
of 15-LOX in mouse and human colorectal tumorigenesis,
mouse colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells and human
colon adenocarcinoma HCA-7 cells were used for mouse
and human colonic tumor growth experiments. Treatment
with a commercially available 15-LOX-1 inhibitor,
PD146176, markedly inhibited mouse MC38 tumor
growth (123 ± 24 vs. 227 ± 40 mg/mouse of vehicle, P <
0.05, n = 10) (Figure 1A). In contrast, PD146176 treatment
promoted human HCA-7 tumor growth (493 ± 62 vs. 217
± 27 mg/mouse of vehicle, P < 0.001, n = 6) (Figure 2A).
Administration of PD146176 inhibits both tumor
cell and host 15-LOX activity. To investigate the potential
role of host 15-LOX in colorectal tumorigenesis,
C57BL/6 wild type or 12/15-LOX knockout mice were
subcutaneously injected with MC38 cells and tumor size
was evaluated 18 days later. As indicated in Figure 1A,
deletion of host 12/15-LOX led to increases in mouse
MC38 tumor growth (458 ± 99 vs. 227 ± 40 mg/mouse
of vehicle, P < 0.05, n = 10), opposite to that seen with
PD146176 treatment.

Eicosanoid profiling in mouse MC38 tumors and
human HCA-7 tumors
To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying
the differential effects of 15-LOX inhibition on mouse
and human colorectal tumorigenesis, we evaluated
tumor eicosanoid profiling by gas chromatographic/
negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric
assays using stable isotope dilution[20]. As shown in
Figure 1B and supplemental Figure S1A, 12-HETE was
the major arachidonic acid metabolite in MC38 tumors,
and its production was markedly inhibited by PD146176
treatment (1498 ± 250 vs. 3150 ± 566 ng/gram tissue of
vehicle, P < 0.05, n = 4), but not by deletion of host 12/15LOX. No other arachidonic acid-derived metabolites
were affected by PD146176 treatment. In addition to
arachidonic acid-derived metabolites, MC38 tumors also
had high levels of 13-HODE, a linoleic acid-derived
metabolite catalyzed by the human 15-LOX-1 enzymatic
activity or mouse 12/15-LOX enzymatic activity. The
production of 13-HODE in MC38 tumors was markedly
inhibited by either PD146176 administration or deletion of
host 12/15-LOX (ng/gram tissue: wild type: 2441 ± 212;
PD146176: 1412 ± 130, P < 0.01; 12/15-LOX deletion:
1577 ± 87, P < 0.01. N = 4 in all groups). These results

suggest that both 12-HETE and 13-HODE might regulate
MC38 tumor growth.
In human HCA-7 tumors, 12-HETE and 13-HODE
were the major metabolites of arachidonic acid and
linoleic acid (Figure 2B and supplemental Figure S1B).
Among all evaluated metabolites from arachidonic acid
and linoleic acid in HCA-7 tumors, only the production
of 13-HODE was inhibited by PD146176 treatment,
suggesting that decreased 13-HODE production might
contribute to increased HCA-7 tumor growth in PD146176
treated mice.

production, intestinal macrophages from C56BL/6 mice
were isolated using CD11b beads, incubated with substrate
(60 µM arachidonic acid or 60 µM linoleic acid, 60 min),
and metabolites were measured. Enzyme activity was
expressed as pM/min/mg protein. As indicated in Figure
3A, macrophages produced similar high levels of 12HETE, 15-HETE and 15-HODE, all of which could be
the products of murine 12/15-LOX. Macrophages also
produced 5-HETE and PGE2 (Figure 3B). Surprisingly,
deletion of 12/15-LOX only significantly inhibited
13-HODE production (pM/min/mg: wild type: 39.3 ±
2.1; 12/15-LOX knockout: 24.9 ± 1.1, P < 0.01, n = 3),
indicating that macrophage 12/15-LOX has the enzymatic
activity converting linoleic acid to 13-HODE.

In the subcutaneous Xenograft tumors, metabolites

P < 0.01, n = 3), but had no effect on the production of
15-HETE and 13-HODE. In contrast, PD146176 inhibited
13-HODE production in HCA-7 cells (0.09 ± 0.02 vs. 0.75

To further investigate the eicosanoid profiling in
mouse MC38 cells metabolized by 12/15-LOX and in
human HCA-7 cells by 12-LOX and 15-LOX-1 and 15LOX-2, siRNA technique was used to silence these genes.
In MC38 cells, gene silence of Alox15 (12/15-LOX)
significantly inhibited the production of 12-HETE (15.27
± 1.13 vs. 26.75 ± 2.26 pM/min/mg of mock control, P <

vs. 25.43 ± 2.64 pM/min/mg of mock control, P > 0.05,
n = 3). In human HCA-7 cells, gene silence of 15-LOX-1
but not 15-LOX-2 inhibited the production of LA-derived
13-HODE (0.652 ± 0.040 vs. 1.171 ± 0.088 pM/min/mg
of mock control, P < 0.001, n = 3), while gene silence of

15-LOX-2 but not 15-LOX-1 inhibited the production of
AA-derived 15-HETE (3.620 ± 0.285 vs. 6.326 ± 0.537
pM/min/mg of Mock control, P < 0.001, n = 3) (Figure 5
C&D). Gene silence of 12-LOX in HCA-7 cells inhibited
the production of AA-derived 12-HETE (3.583 ± 0.279
vs. 5.477 ± 0.322 pM/min/mg of Mock control, P < 0.001,
n = 3).

13-HODE inhibited and 12-HETE stimulated
both murine and human colon cancer cell
proliferation
To investigate the direct effects of 12-HETE, 15HETE and 13-HODE on colon cancer proliferation, we
treated different mouse and human colon cancer cell lines
with these agents and cell proliferation was measured
by using cell proliferation assay kit. As shown in Figure
6A, 12-HETE stimulated MC38 cell proliferation at 0.1
µM, but stimulated HCA-7 cell proliferation at 10 µM,
indicating that 12-HETE is a more potent mitogen for
MC38 cells than HCA-7 cells. In addition, 12-HETE also
potently stimulated the proliferation of CT26 cells, another

the other hand, 13-HODE inhibited the proliferation of all
tested mouse and human colon cancer cell lines (Figure
6 and supplemental Figure S2). 15-HETE had no effect
on cell proliferation in all cell lines investigated (data not
shown).
Human 15-LOX-1 mRNA levels were decreased
in human colonic adenomas. Shureiqi et al reported that
13-HODE levels in human colorectal cancer mucosa and
polyp mucosa were reduced compared to paired normal
colon, while 12-HETE, 15-HETE and leukotriene B4
levels were comparable between normal colon and
colorectal tumors[15]. Therefore we evaluate 15-LOX1 mRNA levels between adenomas with different sizes
and their paired normal colon. As indicated in Figure 7,
15-LOX-1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in
both small and larger adenomas compared with normal
colons (***P < 0.001 vs. paired normal colon, n = 7 in
each group).

cells but inhibited 12-HETE production in MC38 cells;
(5) 12/15-LOX deletion led to decreased production of
13-HODE in isolated intestinal macrophages; and (5) 12HETE stimulated and 13-HODE inhibited both murine
and human colon cancer cell proliferation. Taken together,
these results suggest that PD146176 might promote human
colorectal tumor growth primarily due to inhibition of 13HODE production, but inhibit murine colorectal tumor
growth as a result of inhibition of 12-HETE generation.
The proposed mechanisms underlying rodent 12/15-LOX
regulation of colorectal tumorigenesis are summarized in
Figure 8.
Three murine 12/15-LOX isoforms exist: the
leukocyte-type, the platelet-type, and the epidermis-type.
The leukocyte-type 12/15-LOX is the major isoform
and possesses high enzymatic activity to generate 12HETE and 15-HETE from arachidonic acid and 13HODE from linoleic acid[22]. The leukocyte-type 12/15LOX is primarily expressed in macrophages, and mice
with deletion of this isoform were used in our current
studies[21, 23].
In a xenograft tumor model, tumors contain
epithelial cells from exogenously injected cells and
stroma cells from host. Tumor-stromal interactions play
a key role in the development and progression of cancers.
The solid tumor stromal microenvironment consists of
infiltrating immune cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,
adipocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes as well as
a variety of extracellular matrix components[24-26].
Macrophages are a major component of stroma and have

DISCUSSION
The current studies were undertaken to investigate
the potential role of 15-LOX in colorectal tumorigenesis.
The major findings include the following: (1)
administration of PD146176, a commercially available,
potent and selective inhibitor of 15-LOX-1, promoted
human colonic HCA-7 tumor growth in association with
decreased tumor levels of 13-HODE, which is consistent
with the observation that human 15-LOX-1 suppresses
the development and growth of human colorectal cancer;
(2) PD146176 treatment inhibited murine colonic MC38
tumor growth in association with decreased tumor levels
of both 12-HETE and 13-HODE; (3) 12/15-LOX deletion
in the host tissue promoted MC38 tumor growth in
association with decreased tumor 13-HODE alone; (4)
PD146176 inhibited 13-HODE production in HCA-7

Figure 8: Proposed schema for arachidonic acid
and linoleic acid metabolism-mediated colorectal
tumorigenesis. Both rodent 12/15-LOX and human 15LOX-1 convert linoleic acid to 13-HODE to inhibit colorectal
tumorigenesis. In addition, rodent 12/15-LOX can also
convert arachidonic acid to 12-HETE to promote colorectal
tumorigenesis. The potential role of 12/15-LOX in murine
colonic cancer models should consider tumor cell type (human
or mouse), the relative 12/15-LOX activity in tumor cells and
stroma, and the generation of 12-HETE and 13-HODE in the
tumors.

been reported to play an important role in colorectal
tumorigenesis. Macrophages may release various
chemicals and cytokines and chemokines that regulate
tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis via paracrine action.
In the current studies, we found that 12/15-LOX deletion
led to marked decreases in the production of 13-HODE
in mouse intestinal macrophages, suggesting that mouse
macrophage 12/15-LOX can convert linoleic acid to 13HODE. As PD146176 also inhibited the production of 13HODE in human colon cancer HCA-7 cells, we postulate
that PD146176-induced decreases in 13-HODE levels in
HCA-7 tumors were due to inhibition of human HCA-7
tumor cell 15-LOX-1 activity and in mouse MC38 tumors,
were due to inhibition of 12/15-LOX activity (particularly
in macrophages).
In the cultured mouse colon cancer MC38 cells,
PD146176 treatment inhibited the production of 12-HETE
but not the production of 13-HDOE and 15-HETE. 12/15LOX deletion had no effect on the production of 12-HETE
and 15-HETE in isolated mouse macrophages. Therefore,
we suggest that the tumor promoting effect of host 12/15LOX deletion was due to inhibition of production of
stromal cell 12/15-LOX-derived 13-HODE (Figure 6).
On the other hand, our results indicate that PD146176
inhibited MC38 tumor growth due to inhibition of MC38
cell 12/15-LOX-derived 12-HETE, which is a potent
mitogenic agent for MC38 cells (Figure 6).
Epidemiological studies in humans have suggested
that high intake of linoleic acid can protect against
tumorigenesis[27]. Both human 15-LOX-1 and rodent
12/15-LOX utilize linoleic acid as substrate to generate
tumor suppressive 13-HODE. Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that
strongly influence molecular events in normal and cancer
cells. PPARs can act as nuclear receptors for 13-HODE.
PPAR-δ expression promotes colonic tumorigenesis[28],
while activation of PPARγ inhibits cell proliferation and
induces apoptosis in a retinoblastoma protein-dependent
manner[29]. 13-HODE has been reported to inhibit the
proliferation of colorectal cancer cells through downregulation of PPAR-δ signaling and promotion of PPAR-γ
activity[16, 30]. Linoleic acid is a major component of fat
in commercially available rodent diet. For example, Basal
Diet (Catalog # 7024,TestDiet, St. Louis, MO) contains
3.34% linoleic acid, the major component of fat in the
diet. Therefore, there is enough substrate for 12/15 LOX
to generate 13-HODE in vivo.
Although investigation of the role of 12/15-LOX
in colorectal tumorigenesis is limited and controversial
in animal models[18, 19], studies in human colorectal
tumorigenesis have consistently indicated that15-LOX-1
and its linoleic acid metabolite, 13-HODE, inhibit tumor
growth[14, 16, 31]. 13-HODE inhibits human colorectal
carcinoma cell proliferation and overexpression of 15LOX-1 inhibits human colon cancer cell proliferation
and induces apoptosis[32-34]. Shureiqi et al. recently
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reported that 13-HODE levels were decreased in
colorectal polyp mucosa and in colorectal cancer mucosa
compared with paired normal colon, while the levels of
other lipoxygenase-mediated metabolites including 12- or
15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE, 15-HETE) or
leukotriene B4 levels were comparable between normal
colon and colorectal tumors[15]. In addition, induction of
15-LOX-1 expression and 13-HODE production has been
reported to contribute to colorectal cancer cell apoptosis
induced by NSAIDs[35]. Even expression of human 15LOX-1 in mouse colonic epithelial cells can suppress
colonic tumorigenesis[19]. Although eicosanoid profiling
was not available in this study, it is possible that 13-HODE
production increased in these cells, because linoleic acid,
the substrate of human 15-LOX-1, is robust in rodent food
as described above.
In summary, 15-LOX-1 and its linoleic acid
metabolite, 13-HODE, inhibit human colorectal
tumorigenesis. However, the effect of rodent 12/15
LOX on colorectal tumorigenesis is complicated and is
determined by several factors: tumor cell type (human
or mouse), tumor cell 12/15 LOX level, host 12/15-LOX
activity, relative production of arachidonic acid and
linoleic acid metabolites, and availability of substrate.

Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Vanderbilt University.

Animals
12/15-LOX knockout mice (C57BL/6, stock number
002778) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.
Athymic nude mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague
Dawley (male, 8 week old).

Cell culture and cell proliferation assays
Mouse colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells
(C57BL/6) and CT26 cells (BALB/c), human colon
carcinoma HCA-7 cells, KM12 cells and DLD cells were
grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 4,500 mg/L
glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in 5%
CO2 and 95% air at 37oC[36]. The cells were seeded in
a 96-well plate (1 x 104 cells in 200 µl medium) for 16
hours, then starved for 24 hours in medium containing
2885

Oncotarget

0.1% fetal bovine serum, and various concentrations of
agents (12-HETE, 15-HETE and 13-HODE) were added
for additional 4 hours. Then BrdU solution was added to
each well for 4 hours. Analysis was performed according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (BrdU cell proliferation
assay kit, Cat#6813, Cell Signaling).

Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 25 pmol siRNA and
7.5 μl RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) were diluted in Opti-MEM
(Invitrogen) without serum and antibiotics. After mixing
for 15 min at room temperature, the mixture was added to
a final volume of 1.5ml, and the cells were incubated at
37 °C in a humidified incubator. After 24 h incubation, the
interference mixture was removed, and complete culture
medium was added. The enzyme activity assays were
performed in the cells at 72 h after siRNA transfection as
described above.

Primary tumor growth
For mouse colon adenocarcinoma MC38 tumor
experiments, male wild type and 12/15-LOX-/- mice
(C57BL/6, 8 weeks old) were given 2 dorsal s.c. injections
of MC38 cells (5 x 105 cells per site). Wild type mice
were treated with vehicle (water) or 12/15-LOX inhibitor,
PD146176 (5 mg/kg/day, mini-pump, 2004) and sacrificed
after 18 day of growth. Tumors were weighed at the end
of experiment. For human colon carcinoma experiments,
athymic nude mice were given 2 dorsal s.c. injections of
HCA-7 cells (3.35 × 106 cells per site) with administration
of vehicle (water) or PD146176 (5 mg/kg/day, minipump, 2004) and sacrificed after 4 week of growth. Under
anesthesia with Nembutal (60 mg/kg, i.p.), the tumor
was dissected, weighed, and snap-frozen in liquid N2 for
eicosanoid measurement and other analysis or fixed in
FPAS for immunohistochemistry[37].

Measurement of eicosanoids
Tumor tissue and culture medium eicosanoid
profiling was measured by gas chromatographic/negative
ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assays using
stable isotope dilution, as described previously[20, 38].

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from tumors using TRIzol
reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using
TaqMan real time PCR machine (7900HT, Applied
Biosystems). The Master Mix and gene probes were also
purchased from Applied Biosystems. The primers used for
human ALOX15 (Hs00993766) and β-actin (Hs99999903)
were from Applied Biosystems.

Isolation of intestinal monocytes/macrophages
Intestinal monocytes/macrophages in single–
cell suspensions were enriched using mouse CD11b
Microbeads and MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotec)
following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Huuman tissues
The human samples used in this study were from
the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study (TCPS) protocol
that was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Vanderbilt Medical Center, and written, informed consent
was obtained from all participants.

Enzyme activity assays
Either isolated monocytes/macrophages or cultured
cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium
containing 60 µM arachidonic acid or linoleic acid for 1
hour, medium was harvested for eicosanoid measurements.
Protein concentration was determined by using Pierce
BCA protein assay kit (Cat#23225, Thermo Scientific).
Enzyme activity was expressed as pM/min/mg protein.

Statistics
All values are presented as means, with error bars
representing ± s.e.m. ANOVA and Bonferroni t tests
were used for statistical analysis, and differences were
considered significant when P<0.05.

RNA interference
siRNAs and negative control siRNA (mock)
included ALOX12-human (Cat# 4392420), ALOX15human (15-LOX-1, cat#4392420), ALOX15B-human
(15-LOX-2, cat# 4392420), Alox15-mouse (12/15-LOX,
cat# 4390771) and Silencer Selective Control NO.1 siRNA
(cat# 4390843) were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells
were seeded at a density of 3x105 cells per well on 6-well
plates and grown in 10% FBS/DMEM without antibiotics.
After 24 h, the cells were transfected with siRNA using
