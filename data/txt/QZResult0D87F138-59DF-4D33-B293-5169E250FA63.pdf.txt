ABSTRACT
Trastuzumab prolongs survival in HER2 positive breast cancer patients. However,
resistance remains a challenge. We have previously shown that ADAM17 plays a
key role in maintaining HER2 phosphorylation during trastuzumab treatment. Beside
ADAM17, ADAM10 is the other well characterized ADAM protease responsible for HER
ligand shedding. Therefore, we studied the role of ADAM10 in relation to trastuzumab
treatment and resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. ADAM10 expression was
assessed in HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines and xenograft mice treated with
trastuzumab. Trastuzumab treatment increased ADAM10 levels in HER2 positive breast
cancer cells (p≤0.001 in BT474; p≤0.01 in SKBR3) and in vivo (p≤0.0001) compared
to control, correlating with a decrease in PKB phosphorylation. ADAM10 inhibition or
knockdown enhanced trastuzumab response in naïve and trastuzumab resistant breast
cancer cells. Trastuzumab monotherapy upregulated ADAM10 (p≤0.05); and higher
pre-treatment ADAM10 levels correlated with decreased clinical response (p≤0.05) at
day 21 in HER2 positive breast cancer patients undergoing a trastuzumab treatment
window study. Higher ADAM10 levels correlated with poorer relapse-free survival
(p≤0.01) in a cohort of HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Our studies implicate
a role of ADAM10 in acquired resistance to trastuzumab and establish ADAM10 as a
therapeutic target and a potential biomarker for HER2 positive breast cancer patients.

HER2 occur in about 10-20% of all breast cancer cases,
correlating with poorer outcome [5, 6]. Trastuzumab
(Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody
recognizing HER2 [7, 8], is effective in the treatment
of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer in adjuvant and
metastatic settings [9-12]. However, the response rate
to trastuzumab monotherapy is less than 30% [13] and
primary or acquired resistance remains a challenge.
Therefore, it is of utmost importance to find strategies to
overcome resistance and to establish biomarkers to predict
response and resistance to trastuzumab.
Protein shedding via various ADAMs (a disintegrin
and metalloproteinase) is important for cell fate
determination, migration, and proliferation [14]. ADAM10
has been implicated in the cleavage of a number of proteins
such as Ephrins [15], N-cadherin [16], E-cadherin [17],
Notch receptor and its ligand Delta 1 [18]. ADAM10 is
also involved in the shedding of EGF and betacellulin [19]
as well as the HER2 receptor [20]. The role of ADAM10
overexpression was reported in several malignancies such
as gastric [21], prostate [22], and liver [23] although its
clinical significance in breast cancer is unknown.
We have previously shown that ADAM17 mediates
HER receptor activation during trastuzumab treatment
[24]. Since ADAM17 and ADAM10 are the two best
characterized ADAM proteases responsible for HER
ligand shedding [14], we investigated the role of ADAM10
in relation to trastuzumab treatment and resistance in
HER2 positive breast cell lines, in vivo and in HER2
positive breast cancer patients.

stained for ADAM10 expression. The IHC staining was
first optimized and was specific (figure S1A). ADAM10
expression was increased in trastuzumab treated xenograft
samples (mean IRS 10.6, 95% CI 9.7-11.5) compared
to control (mean IRS 6.2, 95% CI 5.0-7.3; ntotal=30,
p≤0.0001) (figure 1C). Therefore, trastuzumab treatment
led to an upregulation of ADAM10 protein levels in vitro
and in vivo.

RESULTS
Trastuzumab treatment increases ADAM10 levels
in vitro and in vivo
To assess the effect of trastuzumab treatment on
ADAM10 expression, BT474 and SKBR3 cells were
treated with two doses of trastuzumab for 24 hours.
ADAM10 mRNA levels were increased in a dosedependent manner: a 3.6–fold increase in BT474 cells and
a 2.5-fold in SKBR3 after 40µg/ml trastuzumab treatment,
compared to untreated control (figure 1A, left upper and
lower panels, both cell lines, n=3, p≤0.01). ADAM10
protein levels were increased by 7–fold in BT474 and
5–fold in SKBR3 cells (figure 1A, middle and right
panels, n=3 each, p≤0.01). The upregulation of ADAM10
coincided with an increase of the ligand betacellulin,
which is shed by this protease, in the media of trastuzumab
treated cells in comparison to control (figure 1B, n=3,
p≤0.05).
To assess the relevance of this observation in an
in vivo model, tissue samples from BT474 xenograft
models treated with trastuzumab or vehicle [30] were

further assess the effect of PKB inhibition on ADAM10
expression, BT474 and SKBR3 cells were treated with the
AKT/PKB inhibitor. ADAM10 mRNA level was increased
in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines (figure 2C,
upper and lower panels, n=3, p≤0.01 at 24h). ADAM10
protein levels were increased at 1h (figure 2C, upper and
lower panels, n=3, p≤0.01). The increase was also seen
in BT474 xenograft models treated with an AKT/PKB
inhibitor (mean IRS 10.8, 95% CI 6.8-14.8) compared to
control (mean IRS 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-4.3; ntotal=8, p≤0.001)
(figure 2D). We showed that the increase in ADAM10 is
related to the decrease in PKB phosphorylation by using
other agents targeting this protein (neratinib, a TKI, and a

We previously established that the PKB inhibition
by trastuzumab [31] increases ADAM17 levels [24]. Thus,
we investigated this mechanism in relation to ADAM10.
Both trastuzumab and an allosteric AKT/PKB inhibitor
could decrease PKB phosphorylation (figure 2A). In a
dose escalation study using trastuzumab, the decrease of
PKB phosphorylation occurred concomitantly with the
increase of ADAM10 protein level. The increase was nonlinear although the highest dose of trastuzumab yielded
the highest increase of ADAM10 level (figure 2B). To

the media (figure 3A, n=3, p≤0.001, S1B), correlating with
enhanced phosphorylation of EGFR and HER4 receptors
and their preferential dimerization partner HER2 (figures
3B left and right panels, S1D).
We therefore proceeded to assess the effect of
an ADAM10 inhibitor (ADAM10i) in HER2 positive
breast cancer cells. Treatment of SKBR3 and BT474
cells with INCB8765 (specific ADAM10 inhibitor) for
24h led to a decrease in the level of basal (figures 3A,

exogenous ligand stimulation

induced betacellulin secretion in the media (figures 3A,
trastuzumab vs. trastuzumab + ADAM10i, n=3, p≤0.0001,
S1B). ADAM10i also decreased cleavage of HER2,
another substrate of ADAM10 (figure S1C), as reported
previously (20).
In addition, ADAM10i decreased the basal and
trastuzumab induced activation of EGFR, HER4, and
HER2 in both cell lines (figures 3B, S1C). Although
ADAM10 does not shed HER3 ligands (neuregulins),
HER3 activation could be affected by dimerization with
these receptors. ADAM10i alone did not have much effect
on HER3 phosphorylation; however, it was additive to
trastuzumab in decreasing HER3 activation (figure S1E).
ADAM10i and trastuzumab effects on apoptosis and
proliferation were also assessed. Trastuzumab treatment
did not enhance apoptosis, as shown by Annexin V staining
(figure 3C, left panel), although there was an increased
cleaved caspase 7 expression (figures 3C, right panel, S1F)
and a decrease in colony formation (figure 3D, IgG vs.
trastuzumab, n=3, p≤0.001). However, the combination of
trastuzumab with ADAM10i enhanced apoptosis (figures
3C, n=3, p≤0.05, S1F) and inhibited proliferation to a
greater extent than trastuzumab treatment alone (figure
3D, n=3, p≤0.05). ADAM10i also decreased cell numbers
and enhanced trastuzumab response (figures 3E, n=3,
p≤0.05, S1G) in comparison to control. This suggested an
additive effect of ADAM10i and trastuzumab.

To further prove the role of ADAM10, we
silenced ADAM10 using two different siRNAs (and a
combination). The knockdown was first optimized and
ADAM17 levels were not affected (figure S2A and B).
ADAM10 knockdown decreased the phosphorylation
of all HER receptors and the downstream pathways in
comparison to control (figures 4A, left and right panels,
n=3, S2C, 4E), fortifying the ADAM10 inhibitor results
above. It also enhanced apoptosis (figure 4B, n=3,
p≤0.001) and decreased colony formation (figure 4C,
n=3, p≤0.0001) in comparison to control. Furthermore,
ADAM10 knockdown enhanced response to trastuzumab
treatment in both cell lines (figures 4D, n=3, p≤0.01, S2D).
However, the addition of exogenous betacellulin reversed
the inhibitory effect of ADAM10 knockdown on the
activation of HER receptors (EGFR, HER2, and HER4)
and the downstream pathways, which correlated with an
increase in cell proliferation (measured by cell number)
compared to ADAM10 knockdown alone (figure 4E).
This is not surprising since ADAM10 knockdown effect
on the endogenous release of HER ligands and should
not have an effect on the exogenous ligand stimulation.
HER3 phosphorylation was not recovered by the addition
of exogenous betacellulin since it is not a HER3 ligand.
These results confirm the role of ADAM10 in the shedding
of endogenous HER ligands in HER2 positive breast

trastuzumab resistant cells (figure 6D, n=3, p≤0.01) in
comparison to control. However, the effect of ADAM10
knockdown could be counteracted by the addition of
exogenous betacellulin in the resistant cells, similar to the
result in naïve cells (figure S3C). Although withdrawal of
trastuzumab from the resistant cells led to an enhanced
proliferation (n=3, p≤0.01), ADAM10 inhibition or
knockdown reduced cell numbers compared to control
and this effect was independent of trastuzumab treatment
in both resistant cell lines (figure 6E; S3D, left and right
panels).

ADAM10 upregulation occurs in acquired
trastuzumab resistance and resistant cells are
sensitive to ADAM10 inhibition or knockdown
In view of the upregulation of ADAM10 during
trastuzumab treatment in naïve cells, we hypothesized that
ADAM10 might be implicated in acquired trastuzumab
resistance. ADAM10 mRNA and protein levels were
increased in the resistant cells compared to parental cells
(figure 5A, each n=3, p≤0.05). Moreover, betacellulin
levels in the media of resistant cells were also increased
(figure 5B, n=3, p≤0.05). ADAM10 knockdown
decreased the level of betacellulin in the media of SKBR3
resistant cells (figure 5C). In addition, 24h treatment
with ADAM10i (figures 6A; S3A) and ADAM10
knockdown (figures 6B; S3B) decreased HER member
phosphorylation and downstream pathway activation
in trastuzumab resistant cells. ADAM10 inhibition

inhibition in HER2 positive breast cancer cells
We have shown the role of ADAM10 inhibition and
knockdown in naïve and resistant HER2 positive breast
cancer cells. Previously, we established that ADAM17
inhibition also had an additive effect with trastuzumab
treatment [24]. Therefore, we assessed whether a dual
inhibition of ADAM10/17 would be superior to inhibition
of either ADAM10 or ADAM17 alone. Although all

inhibitors enhanced trastuzumab response in SKBR3
and BT474 cells, we found no statistically significant
difference in cell viability between the combinations of
trastuzumab with either the single inhibitors or the dual
one (figure 6F, left and right panels). However, in BT474
resistant cells, ADAM10 inhibition decreased cell count
more than ADAM17 inhibition and dual inhibition was
superior to either inhibitor alone (figure 6G, n=3, p≤0.05).

We showed that the upregulation of ADAM10 levels
occurred during trastuzumab treatment and upon acquired
resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer cells. We
hypothesized that ADAM10 expression might be relevant
as a biomarker to predict prognosis and trastuzumab
response in HER2 positive breast cancer patients.
Therefore we stained tumors from HER2 positive breast

patients received a pre-treatment biopsy and underwent a 21 day trastuzumab (8mg/kg) monotherapy window study before a second biopsy
was performed. Patients further received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy 100 mg/m2 with 6mg/kg trastuzumab q21 prior
to definitive surgery. (B) Paired tissue samples (pre- and post-treatment) from 5 patients who received trastuzumab monotherapy for 21

We assessed ADAM10 levels in patients who
underwent a window study as outlined in figure 7A. The
characteristics of the patients are listed in table S1. The
data from paired samples of patient biopsies (5 out of 10
patients underwent biopsy before and after trastuzumab
monotherapy treatment) showed that ADAM10 levels
were significantly increased at day 21 after one dose
of trastuzumab monotherapy (mean IRS, baseline 0.8,
95% CI -1.4-3.0 vs. post-treatment 6.8, 95% CI 2.610.9, p ≤ 0.05) (figure 7B, left panel), similar to the cell
lines and xenograft results. Moreover, compared to low
basal (= pre-treatment) ADAM10 expression, high basal
ADAM10 expression was associated with a higher Ki67
post/pre treatment ratio (high vs. low ADAM expression,
mean ratio of 1.1, 95% 0.8 to 1.3 vs. 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9
respectively, p=0.02) and bigger tumor size (high vs. low
ADAM10 expression, mean post/pre treatment ratio of
1.2, 95% CI 0.7-1.6 vs. 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9 respectively,
p=0.02) at day 21 of trastuzumab monotherapy (figure 7C,
upper and lower panels).
We also compared basal ADAM10 levels with
those of the tumors obtained at definitive surgery after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab treatment
(8 paired samples). There also was an overall trend for
increased ADAM10 expression in the post-neoadjuvant
treatment samples (figure 7B, right panel). Furthermore,
pre-treatment ADAM10 levels also predicted higher Ki67
and poorer clinical response at definitive surgery, although
these were not statistically significant (figure 7D upper and
lower panels).
To assess the potential prognostic value of ADAM10
levels, we stained a set of consecutive tumor microarrays
from a cohort of HER2 positive breast cancer patients for
basal ADAM10 expression. Altogether, tumor samples
from 69 patients had adequate IHC staining quality
to be used for survival analysis. The patient and tumor
characteristics are listed in table S2. Higher ADAM10
expression was correlated with a statistically significant
poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared to low
ADAM10 expression (Hazard ratio 5.02, 95% CI 1.4117.93 p = 0.006). There was also a trend for a lower overall
survival although this was not statistically significant
(Hazard ratio 1.84, 95% CI 0.31-11.03, p = 0.5) (figure
7E, upper and lower panel). The multivariate analysis
using known important clinicopathological factors such as
age, node status, tumor grade, ER status and tumor size,
suggested that ADAM10 was an independent prognostic
indicator for RFS (p=0.0024) (table S3A)

that trastuzumab treatment induced an upregulation
of ADAM10 and ADAM17 [24], thereby enhancing
ligand release, maintaining HER member activation and
counteracting trastuzumab treatment. This was shown
to be related to PKB inhibition since several inhibitors
(including a TKI and a PI3K inhibitor) that decrease PKB
activation induced ADAM10 upregulation. However, the
increase in ADAM10 level was not in linear relationship to
PKB inhibition. This indicates that there could be several
pathways involved in the upregulation of ADAM10, which
may include the complex crosstalk between PI3K and
MAPK signaling pathways and possible involvement of
the FoxO proteins (downstream targets of PKB) [32-34].
This is likely to be complicated and will be investigated
further. It will be of interest to assess whether other HER
family targeting treatments, such as pertuzumab and
lapatinib also induce ADAM10 and 17. HER ligands (e.g.
betacellulin and heregulin) shed by ADAM10 and 17,
have been shown to mediate resistance to trastuzumab
[24] and TKI treatment [35]. HB-EGF and BTC were
associated with poor clinical outcome [36] and combined
measurement of epigen and neuregulin 4 were predictors
of relapse free and overall survival in breast cancer
patients [37]. Therefore, it would be important to study
further on the interplay between ADAMs with different
HER ligands and the activation and dimerization status
of HER receptors [38] in the resistance mechanisms of
various HER inhibitors in patients.
We showed that naïve and acquired trastuzumabresistant cell lines were sensitive to ADAM10 inhibition
or knockdown through prevention of ligand release
and inhibition of HER receptor activation. The effect
of ADAM10 inhibition is similar to those seen when
inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activities of HER receptors
by neratinib [39]. Another possible effect of ADAM10
inhibition is the counteraction of Notch-signalling,
which has been implicated in trastuzumab resistance [40]
although this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We
showed that the three inhibitors against ADAM10, 17, or
10/17, equally enhanced trastuzumab response in naïve
cells but in acquired resistant cells, the dual inhibition
was superior. However, all these inhibitors may have nonspecific effects on ADAMs and other metalloproteinases
[41]. We are currently investigating whether other ADAMs
play a role in mediating trastuzumab resistance.
Various studies assessed the clinical significance
of ADAMs. ADAM9 was increased in breast cancer in
comparison with normal breast tissue and correlated
positively with HER2 expression [42]. ADAM17
expression was upregulated in breast cancer compared
to normal breast tissue and was highest in lymph-node
metastasis [43]. ADAM10 was upregulated in primary
liver cancer when compared to normal liver tissue [23].
ADAM10 expression in colon cancer enhanced metastasis
[44] and was associated with chemoresistance [45]. Wang
et al. (2011) showed that ADAM10 was upregulated in

DISCUSSION
Trastuzumab is a standard treatment for HER2
overexpressing breast and gastric cancer. However,
primary or acquired resistance remains a major
drawback. This study and our previous study suggested

gastric cancer tissue in comparison to normal tissue; higher
ADAM10 correlated with poorer prognosis and prognostic
markers [21]. Here we report the first study showing
the role of ADAM10 in HER2 positive breast cancer.
ADAM10 expression did not correlate with any known
prognostic markers. However, trastuzumab treatment led
to an increase of ADAM10 level in HER2 positive breast
cancer patients and higher basal ADAM10 expression was
associated with poorer trastuzumab treatment response
and relapse-free survival.
Despite the promising results regarding the role
of ADAM10 in relation to trastuzumab treatment and
resistance shown here, there are limitations to our
study. Since we are interested primarily in the role of
ADAM10 in acquired trastuzumab resistance, we have
not investigated its role in a panel of sensitive and innate
trastuzumab resistant breast cell lines. It will be important
to assess whether ADAM10 expression could predict
response in relation to primary trastuzumab resistance
in a wider panel of breast cell lines with different HER2
expression. The biopsy samples used in our window
study could also pose problems if there is intra-tumor
heterogeneity although the IRS scoring used in this study
took into account both the percentage and intensity of
ADAM10 staining. The other limitations are the small
number of patients used and no statistical plan a priori that
determined the number of patients in our clinical studies.
Thus, despite the statistically significant results shown in
our studies, our work is mainly exploratory and provides
the hypothesis that ADAM10 expression is a potential
prognostic and predictive biomarker. We hope to further
validate ADAM10 as a biomarker using samples from
randomized controlled trials such as FinHER study [46]
in the future.
Our study indicated that ADAM10 is a potential
therapeutic target for HER2 positive breast cancers.
Friedman et al. reported a phase I/II trial using the
compound INCB7839, an ADAM10/17 inhibitor, in
combination with trastuzumab [47]. The overall response
rate in patients with advanced breast cancer was between
40% and 55% and the new drug was well tolerated [47].
The study also showed that ADAM10/17 inhibitor could
reduce HER2 cleavage, which is relevant to HER2
positive patients with tumors expressing p95. We did not
focus our study on the role of ADAM10 in HER2 cleavage
in patients’ samples since there is a lack of validity of
p95 assay and there are controversial reports on the role
of p95 expression in relation to trastuzumab response
and resistance [48, 49]. In view of our data showing the
activities of both ADAM10 and ADAM17 in response
to trastuzumab, we would support further studies to be
done to assess the efficacy of ADAM10/17 inhibitor as
a novel therapy to overcome trastuzumab resistance for
HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Moreover, the role
of ADAM10/17 inhibition in addition to the combination
of anti-HER2 therapies such as trastuzumab with lapatinib
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or pertuzumab should be investigated.
In summary, we showed that an upregulation of
ADAM10 level occurred upon trastuzumab treatment
and resistance. Inhibition or knockdown of ADAM10
enhanced trastuzumab response in parental cells and
reversed acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2
positive breast cancer cells. For patients who underwent
trastuzumab monotherapy, trastuzumab treatment
increased ADAM10 expression and pre-treatment high
ADAM10 levels predicted poor response to trastuzumab
at day 21. Moreover, in a cohort of HER2 positive breast
cancer patients, higher basal ADAM10 expressions were
correlated with poorer relapse-free survival. Therefore,
our results indicate that targeting ADAM10 and ADAM17
might enhance trastuzumab response and overcome
acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast
cancer patients. We propose further validation studies to
confirm ADAM10 level as a prognostic and predictive
biomarker in HER2 positive breast cancer patients
undergoing trastuzumab treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines were provided by cell
services lab at Cancer Research UK (Lincoln’s Inn Fields
laboratory), which has a stringent quality control in cell
authenticity and has incorporated short-tandem repeat
(STR) profiling for cell line validation. Cell culturing
and the generation of trastuzumab resistant cells were
described previously [24].

ADAM10 IHC scoring
ADAM10 expression level was scored semiquantitatively using immunohistochemistry on tumor
samples based on staining intensity and distribution using
the immunoreactive score of Remmele and Stegner (IRS)
[25]. The scoring criteria is a composite score based on
staining intensity (SI) and percentage of positive cells (PP)
using the formula IRS = SI × PP. The staining intensity
(SI) was determined as 0 = negative; 1 = weak; 2 =
moderate; and 3 = strong and the percentage of positive
cells (PP) was defined as 0, <1%; 1, 1%–10%; 2, 11%–
50%; 3, 51%–80%; and 4, >80% positive cells. Low
ADAM10 expression was defined as no or weak staining
in tumors (IRS of ≤ 1).

Prism 6 software (GraphPad software) was used for
statistical analysis. The differences between two means
were assessed by t-Test. When investigating one factor,
one-way ANOVA was used with Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison. For two factors, two-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s multiple comparison [28] was used, specifying
the number of comparisons prior to analysis. Associations
between the co-variables and ADAM10 level were tested
by Fisher’s exact test. Overall survival (OS) is defined
as percentage of patients still alive in the study period
after diagnosis; and relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined
as the proportion of patients without relapse (local or
distant recurrence) during the defined period [29]. The
multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling and the
Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis were done in R
statistical environment (v.2.14.1) (R package: survival
v2.36-14). Tests of statistical significance were two-sided
and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant in all the above tests. P values are shown (*p ≤
0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001).
