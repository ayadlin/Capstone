BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of osteosarcoma includes cisplatin and high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX);
both agents exert significant toxicity, and HDMTX requires complex pharmacokinetic monitoring and leucovorin rescue. In the previous OS91 trial, the treatment of localized disease with carboplatin, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and
HDMTX yielded outcomes comparable to those of cisplatin-based regimens and caused less toxicity. To build on
this experience, the authors conducted a multi-institutional trial (OS99) that evaluated the efficacy of carboplatin,
ifosfamide, and doxorubicin without HDMTX in patients with newly diagnosed, localized, resectable osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Treatment was comprised of 12 cycles of chemotherapy administered over 35 weeks: 3 cycles of carboplatin (dose targeted to area under the concentration-time curve of 8 mg/mL  min on Day 1) and ifosfamide (at a
dose of 2.65 g/m2 daily 3 days) and 1 cycle of doxorubicin (at a dose of 25 mg/m2 daily 3 days) before surgical
resection, followed by 2 additional cycles of the combination of carboplatin and ifosfamide and 3 cycles each of doxorubicin (25 mg/m2 daily 2 days) combined with ifosfamide or carboplatin. RESULTS: A total of 72 eligible patients
(median age, 13.4 years) were enrolled between May 1999 and May 2006. Forty of the 66 (60.6%) evaluable patients
had good histologic responses (>90% tumor necrosis) to preoperative chemotherapy. The estimated 5-year eventfree survival rate was 66.7%  7.0% for the OS99 trial compared with 66.0%  6.8% for the OS91 trial (P ¼ .98). The
estimated 5-year survival rate was 78.9%  6.3% for the OS99 trial and 74.5%  6.3% for the OS91 trial (P ¼ .40).
CONCLUSIONS: The regimen used in the OS99 trial was found to produce outcomes comparable to those of cisplatin-containing or HDMTX-containing regimens. This therapy offers a good alternative for patients, particularly those
who demonstrate an intolerance of HDMTX, and for institutions that cannot provide pharmacokinetic monitoring for

doxorubicin, cisplatin, and high-dose methotrexate
(HDMTX). Although cisplatin and HDMTX are very
effective, they can cause significant toxicities, including
nephrotoxicity, otoxicity, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and neurotoxicity. Some MTX toxicities,
such as mucositis and nephrotoxicity, are associated with
delayed MTX clearance, which can be affected by renal
function and other nephrotoxic drugs such as cisplatin.7
Our previous osteosarcoma trial (OS91) evaluated
the combination of carboplatin and ifosfamide given as
upfront window therapy, plus doxorubicin and
HDMTX.8 Although single-agent carboplatin has shown
very limited activity against previously untreated metastatic osteosarcoma,9 carboplatin combined with ifosfamide demonstrated substantial antitumor activity in the
OS91 trial.8 This activity was not attributable to ifosfamide alone, because the rate of early disease progression
was significantly lower than that noted with ifosfamide
alone.8,10 For localized osteosarcoma, the OS91 trial
yielded outcomes comparable to those of cisplatin-based
regimens and caused less toxicity.8
The necessity for HDMTX in the context of multiagent chemotherapy for osteosarcoma has been questioned,
and some postulate that HDMTX toxicity interferes with
the dose-intensive delivery of other active agents.7,11-13 In
addition, HDMTX administration requires rigorous pharmacokinetic monitoring and rescue with leucovorin that is
dose-adjusted to MTX levels.7,14 The expertise and technology required for this monitoring are not available at
some institutions. Therefore, an effective chemotherapy
regimen that does not contain HDMTX would be of benefit, especially for patients with renal dysfunction.
We wished to investigate whether the complexity and
potential toxicity of HDMTX administration can be
avoided. Thus, the OS99 trial assessed the use of carboplatin,
ifosfamide, and doxorubicin without HDMTX for the treatment of patients with localized, resectable osteosarcoma. In
addition, because minimal resection of tumor-free bone may
improve prosthesis fixation and help preserve growth potential in children, the OS99 trial also explored whether resection of the primary tumor with a 3-cm rather than a 5-cm
(as used in the OS91 trial) bone margin can be performed
without increasing the rate of local disease recurrence.

MacKenna Hospital, Santiago, Chile; and Washington
University Medical School, St. Louis, Missouri. Eligibility
requirements included age <25 years; previously
untreated, nonmetastatic, histologically proven, highgrade osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma of
bone (patients with parosteal or periosteal osteosarcoma
were not eligible) that was resectable by either limb-sparing surgery or amputation; total serum bilirubin <1.5
times that of normal; serum creatinine <2 times that of
normal; no evidence of cardiac rhythm disturbance or cardiomyopathy; and signed informed consent provided by
the patient, parent, or guardian, as appropriate. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all
participating institutions.
Chemotherapy Protocol
The protocol was comprised of 12 cycles of chemotherapy
(1 cycle every 3 weeks over 35 weeks) (Fig. 1). Preoperative chemotherapy was comprised of 3 cycles of carboplatin (at a dose targeted to achieve an area under the
concentration-time curve [AUC] of 8 mg/mL  min on
Day 1) and ifosfamide (at a dose of 2.65 g/m2 daily on
Days 1–3) and 1 cycle of doxorubicin (at a dose of 25 mg/
m2 daily for 3 days). Tumor resection at Week 12 was followed by 2 additional cycles of the combination of carboplatin and ifosfamide given as described above and 3
cycles each of ifosfamide (at a dose of 2.65 g/m2 daily on
Days 1–3) and doxorubicin (at a dose of 25 mg/m2 daily
on Days 1 and 2) and of carboplatin (dose targeted to an
AUC of 8 mg/mL  min on Day 1) and doxorubicin (at a
dose of 25 mg/m2 daily on Days 1 and 2). Carboplatin
dosage was based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
as measured by technetium 99m-diethylene triamine
penta-acetic acid clearance or 24-hour urine creatinine
clearance to ensure consistent systemic exposure among
patients.15 The carboplatin dose (infused over 1 hour) was

2771

Original Article

calculated as follows: dose (mg/m2) ¼ 8[(0.93  GFR
in ml/min/m2) þ 15].16,17 Ifosfamide was infused over 15
to 30 minutes and doxorubicin over 1 hour. Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor was administered after
each cycle. The total cumulative dose of doxorubicin was
375 mg/m2 and that of ifosfamide was 63.6 g/m2.
Patient Evaluation
Standard laboratory tests to assess toxicity, including complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and urinalysis,
were obtained at baseline and at regular intervals until at
least 4 years after the completion of therapy. The initial
staging workup was comprised of plain radiography and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including dynamic
contrast-enhanced MRI18,19 of the primary tumor, technetium 99 methyldiphosphonate nuclear bone scanning,
and computed tomography (CT) of the chest. These studies were repeated after 3 cycles of carboplatin and ifosfamide (Week 9), before definitive surgery (Week 12), and
(without MRI) at the completion of therapy. Chest CT
was performed during therapy at Weeks 23 and 32. After
the completion of treatment, patients were monitored by
plain radiography or CT scans of the chest and by radiography of the primary tumor site every 2 months and by
bone scans every 6 months for the first year. Subsequently,
patients underwent radiography or CT of the chest every
3 months to 6 months and radiography of the primary tumor site every 6 months to 12 months for at least 4 years
after the completion of therapy.
Evaluation of Response
Clinical and radiologic responses were assessed at
Weeks 9 and 12 (Fig. 1). Patients were considered to
have achieved a response if they became free of pain
without the use of analgesics and MRI indicated either
decreased (50% reduction in the product of the 3
perpendicular tumor diameters) or stable (<50%
reduction or <25% increase in the product of the 3
perpendicular tumor diameters) tumor volume. Patients
with persistent pain and stable tumor volume on MRI
were considered to have stable disease. Patients with
significantly increased tumor size (25% increase in
the product of the 3 perpendicular tumor diameters)
on MRI or those with new lesions were considered to
have progressive disease. The 4-grade system of Huvos
et al20 and Rosen et al21 was used for histologic assessment of the tumor response at the time of surgical

2772

resection. Central review of tumor histology and tumor
histologic response was performed at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
Evaluation of Toxicity
Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0). Patients underwent echocardiography, electrocardiography, pure-tone
audiometry, and GFR assessment before the initiation of
treatment and serially thereafter.
Statistical Analysis
The OS99 trial was designed as a historical control
phase 2 study to compare the histologic response rate
induced by 2 preoperative regimens: 3 cycles of carboplatin and ifosfamide plus 1 cycle of doxorubicin in
patients treated in the OS99 trial and 3 cycles of carboplatin and ifosfamide in patients treated in the OS91
trial.22,23 Patients with localized, resectable osteosarcoma treated in the OS91 trial served as the historical
control group. The study included an interim analysis
for futility after half of the patients were evaluated. The
Fisher exact test was used to compare the histologic
response rate between the OS91 and OS99 trials and
confidence intervals of the response rate were calculated
using the Blyth-Still-Casella method. The study also
compared the event-free survival (EFS) and survival of
patients treated without HDMTX (OS99 trial) with
those of patients treated with HDMTX (OS91 trial).
EFS and survival were not the primary endpoints of the
OS99 trial and therefore the study was not designed to
detect a prespecified difference in EFS or survival
between the OS99 and OS91 trials. Survival was
defined as the time between study enrollment and last
follow-up or death from any cause. EFS was defined as
the time between study enrollment and disease progression or recurrence, diagnosis of a second malignancy,
death from any cause, or last follow-up. Survival and
EFS distributions were estimated using the method of
Kaplan and Meier.24 The log-rank test was used to
compare survival and EFS distributions.
The effect of reduced surgical bone margin was
assessed by comparing the cumulative incidence of local
treatment failure (local disease progression or recurrence)25 in the OS99 and OS91 trials using the Gray
test.26 Competing events were distant failure, second
malignancy, or death before local failure. Patients with simultaneous local and distant treatment failure were considered to have local failure for this analysis.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between May 1999 and May 2006, 72 eligible patients
were enrolled on the OS99 trial (Table 1). The median
age was 13.4 years (range, 3.2 years-23.0 years). Forty-one
patients (57%) were male and 33 (46%) were white. The
most common primary tumor site was the femur (n ¼ 46;
64%). Our previous OS91 trial enrolled 47 patients with
localized, resectable osteosarcoma8; the median age of the
patients was 13.6 years (range, 5.9 years-19.4 years).
Patients treated on the OS99 and OS91 trials were similar
with respect to age (P ¼ .53), gender (P ¼ .35), and primary tumor site (extremity vs other; P ¼ .38). Data
regarding tumor size for the patients on the OS91 trial
were not available for comparison.
Histologic Response
Comparison of the histologic response rate of the OS99
trial at Week 12 (after 3 cycles of carboplatin and ifosfamide and 1 cycle of doxorubicin) with that of the OS91
trial at Week 9 (after 3 cycles of carboplatin and ifosfamide) included patients in the OS99 trial who received 4
cycles of chemotherapy before tumor resection (n ¼ 63
patients) plus 3 patients who developed local disease pro-

gression before Week 12 and were considered nonresponders (total n ¼ 66 patients). Six patients were
considered inevaluable for histologic response: 1 died of
bacterial sepsis after 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy and 5 underwent delayed tumor resection (after Week
12). Four of these 5 patients received 5 cycles of chemotherapy before surgery because of delayed readiness of the
endoprostheses (n ¼ 3 patients) or surgery scheduling
problems (n ¼ 1 patient). Tumor resection in the fifth
patient was delayed until after the completion of chemotherapy because of underlying insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, which may increase the risk of delayed wound
healing and infection. The histologic grade of the resected
tumors in these 5 patients was grade IV in 2 patients,
grade III in 2 patients, and grade II in 1 patient.
Forty patients who underwent tumor resection at
Week 12 had a histologic response (>90% tumor necrosis): grade III (n ¼ 29) or IV (n ¼ 11). Therefore, the histologic response rate to preoperative chemotherapy (3
cycles of carboplatin and ifosfamide and 1 cycle of doxorubicin) was 61% (40 of 66 patients; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 48%-72%). In comparison, in the
OS91 trial, the histologic response rate to preoperative
chemotherapy (3 cycles of carboplatin and ifosfamide) in
patients with localized, resectable disease was 51% (95%
CI, 36%-66%) (P ¼ .34).
Survival
The median duration of follow-up after study enrollment
was 5.1 years (range, 2.2 years-9.9 years) for the 58 surviving patients treated in the OS99 trial. All survivors were
seen or contacted within 1 year of the analysis. First events
included disease recurrence or progression (n ¼ 22
patients), second malignancy (acute myelogenous leukemia; n ¼ 1 patient), and death from sepsis (n ¼ 1 patient).
Twelve of the 22 patients with recurrent or progressive
disease had died at the time of last follow-up. The 5-year
estimates of EFS and survival were 66.7%  7.0% and
78.9%  6.3%, respectively (Fig. 2).
Thirty-four of the 47 patients with localized, resectable osteosarcoma treated in the OS91 trial survived. The
34 survivors had a median follow-up of 13.1 years (range,
8.2 years-16.4 years), and 77% had been seen or contacted
within 2 years of the analysis.
There was no evidence of a difference between the
OS91 and OS99 trials with regard to EFS or survival distributions (Fig. 3). The 5-year estimates of EFS were
66.7%  7.0% for the OS99 trial and 66.0%  6.8% for
the OS91 trial (P ¼ .98). The 5-year estimates of survival

Local Failure

surgery, 59 (88%) underwent limb-salvage procedures
and 8 (12%) underwent amputation. The other 3 patients

with extremity tumors developed local disease progression
(n ¼ 2 patients) or died (n ¼ 1 patient) before surgery. In
the 57 patients who underwent limb-salvage surgery and
for whom data were available, the median bone resection
margin was 4 cm (range, 1 cm-15 cm) and was at least
3 cm in 43 (75%) patients. The closest soft tissue margin
in the majority of patients measured 1 mm to 2 mm.
There were 7 local failures as first events among the
72 patients on the OS99 trial. Five of these were disease
progression: 3 patients developed local progression demonstrated by imaging before surgery and 2 developed local
progression suggested by imaging and confirmed by histologic analysis after surgical resection. There were only 2
(3%) local recurrences: 1 was associated with a distant recurrence 3.5 years after diagnosis and the other occurred 4
years after diagnosis. The bone resection margins in these
2 cases were 3 cm and 5 cm, respectively. The cumulative
incidence of local failure in the OS99 and OS91 trials was
estimated from the data regarding first events. There was
no evidence that local control differed by protocol (Fig.
4). The 5-year estimates of the cumulative incidence of
local failure were 10.6%  3.9% for the OS99 trial and
12.8  4.9% for the OS91 trial (P ¼ .64).
Toxicity
Protocol chemotherapy was well tolerated and delivered
primarily (65% of cycles) in the outpatient setting. Table
2 summarizes the grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed during
the 782 cycles of chemotherapy. The most common toxicity was myelosuppression. One patient died of bacterial
sepsis after the third cycle of chemotherapy. Another
patient, who achieved complete remission of osteosarcoma, had a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia M5

DISCUSSION
The results of the current trial demonstrated that the
administration of carboplatin, ifosfamide, and doxorubiCancer

June 15, 2011

cin produces EFS and survival outcomes comparable to
those of HDMTX-containing or cisplatin-containing regimens in patients with localized, resectable osteosarcoma.3-5,8,27-29 Protocol chemotherapy was found to be
well tolerated and was administered mainly in the outpatient setting. This regimen eliminates the need for MTX
pharmacokinetic monitoring and avoids the toxicities
associated with HDMTX and cisplatin. The regimen used
in the OS99 trial offers a good alternative for patients
with localized, resectable disease, particularly those who
demonstrate intolerance of HDMTX, and for institutions
that cannot provide MTX monitoring.
The histologic response rate to preoperative chemotherapy in the current study (3 cycles of carboplatin and
ifosfamide and 1 cycle of doxorubicin; 12 weeks) was
61%. In comparison, the histologic response rate was
43% to preoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and
HDMTX (10 weeks) and 48% to preoperative ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and HDMTX (10 weeks) in the Intergroup osteosarcoma trial INT0133.3 That trial defined
histologic response as residual viable tumor of <5% at the
time of definitive surgery,30,31 whereas the threshold in

2775

Original Article

the OS99 trial was 10%. Although single-agent carboplatin did not demonstrate significant activity against newly
diagnosed metastatic osteosarcoma, it did demonstrate
substantial activity against osteosarcoma when combined
with ifosfamide in 2 consecutive trials at the St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital (OS91 and OS99).
The role of HDMTX has been investigated in
patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma. The first European Osteosarcoma Intergroup (EOI) study, which randomly assigned patients to 18 weeks of treatment with
cisplatin and doxorubicin versus cisplatin, doxorubicin,
and HDMTX (8 g/m2), found no greater likelihood of
disease-free survival or survival in the HDMTX arm.11
The subsequent EOI study also found no difference in
progression-free survival or survival between patients randomly assigned to cisplatin and doxorubicin for 18 weeks
and those assigned to a multiagent regimen including
HDMTX (at a dose of 8-12 g/m2) for 44 weeks.12 However, the cisplatin and doxorubicin regimen appears to
produce survival estimates (55% at 5 years) that are inferior to those of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and HDMTX (12
g/m2) (71% at 6 years).3,12,28 A third study that used ifosfamide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and etoposide without
MTX demonstrated a 3-year progression-free survival rate
of 70%.13 These data suggest that osteosarcoma can be
treated without HDMTX but that a 2-drug chemotherapy regimen is not sufficient.
Carboplatin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin given
without HDMTX in the OS99 trial resulted in 5-year
EFS and survival estimates of 66.7%  7.0% and 78.9%
 6.3%, respectively, for patients with localized resectable
osteosarcoma. These results are comparable to those of
regimens containing cisplatin and HDMTX,3,28 including the most widely accepted chemotherapy regimen for
localized osteosarcoma (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and
HDMTX) (6-year EFS and survival estimates, 64% and
71%, respectively).28 Outcomes in our OS91 trial, which
used ifosfamide and carboplatin rather than cisplatin,
were comparable to those of cisplatin-based regimens and
reduced the risk of ototoxicity.8 The elimination of
HDMTX in the OS99 trial did not appear to negatively
affect outcome. It is important to note that all but 2 of our
patients had extremity tumors, and such patients have a
more favorable prognosis than patients with axial tumors,
who were included in very limited numbers in some of the
other studies.3,28 The regimen used in the OS99 trial
avoids the toxicity of HDMTX and uses carboplatin,
which causes less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than cisplatin; however, it includes ifosfamide, which may cause

urinary electrolyte wasting, hemorrhagic cystitis, and

In Intergroup osteosarcoma trial INT0133,3 677
patients with localized osteosarcoma were randomly
assigned to receive cisplatin, doxorubicin, and HDMTX
with or without ifosfamide, and with or without muramyl
tripeptide (MTP), a synthetic lipophilic glycopeptide that
activates monocyte and macrophage antitumor activity.
Although an initial analysis did not demonstrate an
improvement in EFS with the addition of MTP,3 an
updated analysis concluded that the 6-year survival rate
had improved from 70% to 78%.28 MTP has been
approved in Europe in combination with chemotherapy
for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic osteosarcoma. Notably, the addition of ifosfamide to the combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and
HDMTX in the INT0133 trial did not appear to enhance
EFS or overall survival.3,28 The most recent Children’s
Oncology Group (COG) pilot studies indicated a 2-year
EFS rate of 69% for patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma without significant benefit from intensification of
the doxorubicin dose (cumulative dose, 600 mg/m2) or
the addition of high-dose ifosfamide (14 g/m2/cycle) and
etoposide for patients with <98% tumor necrosis at the
time of surgery.27 These trials suggest that intensification
of chemotherapy and the addition of new cytotoxic agents
do not improve patient outcome, underscoring the need
for novel treatment strategies. A better understanding of
the biology of osteosarcoma is critical to identify potential
targets for therapy.
Most of our patients underwent limb-salvage surgery for local control. The baseline MRI was used to
determine the extent of tumor resection unless there was
evidence of disease progression, in which case the most
recent MRI was used. The use of a 3-cm bone resection
margin in the OS99 trial did not appear to adversely
affect the rate of local control. This finding may be attributable to improved surgical and imaging techniques,
especially because modern MRI allows for better delineation of the extent of the tumor and its relation to the
neurovascular bundle. Our rate of local recurrence (3%)
was similar to the 2% to 10% rates cited by
others.2,29,33-35 A smaller bone resection margin
improves the likelihood of preserving the growth plate in
growing children and provides a greater area for fixation
of the endoprosthesis.
Although the current study was a phase 2 study with
a limited number of patients, the results provide evidence
that localized osteosarcoma can be treated with

carboplatin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin, as used in the
OS99 trial, without compromising EFS or survival. These
results have important implications not only for avoiding
the toxicity of HDMTX but also for reducing the cost
and treatment complexity associated with HDMTX.
Although minimizing toxicity and cost is important,
improvement in outcome requires further understanding
of tumor biology and the development of rational targeted
therapies.
