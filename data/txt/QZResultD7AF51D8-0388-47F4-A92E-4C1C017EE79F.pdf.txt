ABSTRACT:
Vemurafenib/PLX4032, a selective inhibitor of mutant BRAFV600E, constitutes
a paradigm shift in melanoma therapy. Unfortunately, acquired resistance, which
unavoidably occurs, represents one major limitation to clinical responses. Recent
studies have highlighted that vemurafenib activated oxidative metabolism in
BRAFV600E melanomas expressing PGC1α. However, the oxidative state of
melanoma resistant to BRAF inhibitors is unknown. We established representative
in vitro and in vivo models of human melanoma resistant to vemurafenib including
primary specimens derived from melanoma patients. Firstly, our study reveals that
vemurafenib increased mitochondrial respiration and ROS production in BRAFV600E
melanoma cell lines regardless the expression of PGC1α. Secondly, melanoma cells
that have acquired resistance to vemurafenib displayed intrinsically high rates of
mitochondrial respiration associated with elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress
irrespective of the presence of vemurafenib. Thirdly, the elevated ROS level rendered
vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells prone to cell death induced by pro-oxidants
including the clinical trial drug, elesclomol. Based on these observations, we propose
that the mitochondrial oxidative signature of resistant melanoma constitutes a novel
opportunity to overcome resistance to BRAF inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

cancers. Results of phase II and III clinical trials with the
first BRAF mutant selective inhibitor validated in clinic,
vemurafenib/PLX4032, have revealed an impressive
short-term disease stabilization in melanoma patients
with BRAFV600E mutation [4,5]. Despise its promise,
the major drawback of BRAF inhibition therapy, which
has not yet been solved, is the apparition of resistance
that inevitably occurs in patients even after an initial

Activating mutations in BRAF, such as
BRAFV600E can lead to aberrant MAPK signalling
and proliferation in human tumors including melanoma,
papillary thyroid carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal
tumor [1-3]. Recently, targeting of mutants BRAF has
emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in these

striking response [4]. Multiple molecular mechanisms of
acquired resistance have been described culminating in the
reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway associated
or not with the aberrant activation of the Akt pathway [6].
That includes the compensatory upregulation of receptor
tyrosine kinases (such as PDGFRβ or IGFR1), activation
of downstream kinases through oncogenic mutations of
RAS or MEK, and upregulation of MAP3K8/COT or
C-RAF kinases (for review [7,8]). Given the diversity of
mechanisms, overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors
remains challenging. Inhibition of mutant RAS has not
yet resulted in effective therapeutic strategy [9]. MEK
inhibitors have been unsuccessful both in preclinical
models and in patients with resistance to BRAF inhibitors
[10] suggesting that other compensatory pathways
would be involved and, to date, no effective therapy that
circumvents melanoma resistant to BRAF inhibitors is
available. Thus, these observations highlight urgent need
to find new therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance
to BRAF inhibitors.
It is widely admitted that most cancer cells exhibit
specific metabolic phenotypes that allow them to
highly proliferate and survive to adverse environmental
conditions [11]. Lessons from the last decade indicate that
metabolic profile of cancer is much more heterogeneous
than expected because metabolic pathways are intrinsically
driven by oncogenic mutations, tumour suppressor gene
inactivation and aberrant activation of proliferative
pathways [12]. We and others have previously observed
that metastatic melanomas are characterized by their strict
dependence on glucose and glutamine for proliferation
[13,14]. In approximately 90 % of melanomas, this
metabolic phenotype is associated with low mitochondrial
bioenergetics activity [13,15,16]. However, the metabolic
machinery of melanoma cells is not rigid and mitochondria
are likely to have a key role in the metabolic flexibility of
melanoma. In line with this, inhibition of the HIF/PDK
signalling axis or overexpression of the key transcriptional
cofactor in mitochondrial biogenesis, PGC1α, can restore
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in melanoma
[13,15,17]. This latter is particularly relevant since PGC1α
expression is transcriptionally controlled by the oncogenic
melanocyte lineage-specification transcription factor,
MITF, in a minor subset of melanomas [15].
It has been recently shown that MAPK activation
slows down mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by
repressing the MITF/PGC1α pathway [18]. Conversely,
BRAF inhibitors stimulate mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation thereby promoting ROS production in
melanoma cells [15,18]. The oxidative metabolism can
be considered as an adaptive mechanism that limits the
efficacy of BRAF inhibitors [18]. In the current study,
we examined mitochondrial metabolism and ROS
production in several melanoma cell lines that exhibit
acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib.
We have observed that BRAF inhibitor-resistant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

melanomas develop an addiction to mitochondrial
oxidative metabolism characterized by high levels of
basal mitochondrial respiration and ROS production.
This metabolic phenotype, which is present irrespective
of the expression of PGC1α, renders BRAF inhibitor–
resistant melanoma cells highly vulnerable to several
mitochondrial-targeted compounds including the
mitochondrial pro-oxidative drug, elesclomol. These
findings have particular implications for the development
of new therapeutic strategies to eradicate melanomas that
become resistant to BRAF inhibitors.

RESULTS
Mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production
are induced by vemurafenib in BRAFV600E
mutant melanoma cell lines irrespective of the
PGC1α status
Consistent with previous data [18], suppression
of BRAFV600E signalling by vemurafenib exposure
increased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an
indicator of OXPHOS, in the BRAFV600E mutant human
melanoma cell lines, A375, SKMel28 and WM9 (Fig.
1A). At concentrations inhibiting the MAPK pathway
(Fig. 2B), vemurafenib exhibited both a higher basal
OCR and a higher maximum respiratory capacity in
comparison to untreated cells (Fig. 1A). The respiration
inhibitor, KCN, enhanced vemurafenib-induced cell death
in a dose-dependent manner indicating that OXPHOS
is a limiting factor of the efficacy of vemurafenib
(Fig. 1B and [18]). Since ROS are generated as byproducts of the mitochondrial electron transport chain
activity, we checked whether vemurafenib-increased
respiration is associated with cellular ROS elevation.
Mitochondrial superoxide detected with MitoSOX
reagent was significantly increased in BRAFV600E
mutant melanoma cell lines after vemurafenib exposure,
an effect largely prevented by pretreatment with the
antioxidants VitC and VitE (Fig. 1C). The increase in
mitochondrial respiration and ROS generation persisted
even 24h after vemurafenib removal (Fig. 1D). Moreover,
the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker of
ROS-dependent lipid peroxidation, were enhanced in
A375 melanoma cells after exposition to vemurafenib
(Fig. 1E) as well as in plasma after one-month treatment
of patients with vemurafenib (Fig. 1F). Unlike WM9 cell
line, the commercially available melanoma cell lines
A375 and SKMel28 did not express significant level of
PGC1α (Fig.1G, 1H and [15,18]). Collectively, it appears
that vemurafenib increases mitochondrial respiration and
oxidative stress in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell
lines including those that fail to express PGC1α.

Vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells exhibit
high dependence on mitochondrial activity and
constitutive oxidative stress

investigated the dependence of cells on mitochondrial
oxidative metabolism (Fig.3). First, both routine
respiration and maximum respiratory capacity (respiration
stimulated with FCCP) were significantly enhanced in the
four vemurafenib-resistant sub-lines compared to their
parental counterparts (Fig. 3A). Consistent with their high
mitochondrial metabolism, vemurafenib-resistant cells
were more sensitive than parental cells to the lethal effect
of the complex IV inhibitor, KCN (Fig. 3B) suggesting
that melanoma resistant to BRAF inhibitors largely depend
on mitochondrial metabolism for survival. We also noticed
that vemurafenib-resistant cells presented a low content
in several TCA intermediates and in lactate level, an
observation compatible with high mitochondrial activity
(Table 1). As previously observed [18], vemurafenib
increased the mitochondrial content of melanoma cells
sensitive to BRAF inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. 2B).
Conversely, the mitochondrial biogenesis response was
not affected in vemurafenib-resistant cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2A and 2B). Although vemurafenib-resistant cells
did not have more mitochondria, qualitative examination
of mitochondria by electron microscopy revealed
morphological changes including more cristae with
wide intracristal spaces in vemurafenib resistant cells
compared to sensitive cells (Fig. 3C). Consistent with
the high mitochondrial activity observed in vemurafenibresistant cells, these cells generated more mitochondrial
ROS (assessed by flow cytometric analysis of MitoSox
fluorescence) than their sensitive counterparts (Fig.3D).
As revealed by the overlap of ROS-dependent H2DCFDA
fluorescence and DsRedMito fluorescence, we confirmed
that mitochondria are an important source of ROS in
vemurafenib-resistant cells (Fig. 3E). Similar ROS
increasing pattern was observed in vemurafenib-resistant
cells after transfection with Hypermito, a genetically
encoded probe for specific detection of mitochondrial
hydrogen peroxide [21] (Supplementary Fig 2D).
Addition of the uncoupler FCCP maximized mitochondrial
respiration (Fig 1A and 3A) and increased mitochondrial
ROS (Fig. 3F). The pro-oxidative effect of FCCP was
more pronounced in vemurafenib-resistant cells than
in parental cells, in agreement with its higher effect on
the respiration of vemurafenib-resistant cells (Fig. 3A).
Enhanced respiration correlated well with the increase
in ROS generation in melanoma cell lines (Spearman
R=0.85, p=0.02) confirming the mitochondrial origin of
ROS in these cells (Fig. 3G). Consistent with oxidative
stress, the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione
(GSSG/GSH) was elevated in vemurafenib-resistant cells
compared to parental cells (Fig. 3H). This was associated
with a slight increase in the amount of total glutathione
(Fig. 3H) and of the level of the anti-oxidant enzyme,
catalase, in vemurafenib-resistant cells. We conclude,
therefore, that mitochondrial oxidative stress is a cellular
characteristic of melanoma cells that have acquired
resistance to vemurafenib.

We next generated the acquired vemurafenibresistant sub-lines (A375C3, SKMel28V3, WM9R)
by prolonged exposure of the parental cell lines to
vemurafenib. In an attempt to simulate the physiological
apparition of resistance, we also constantly treated
A375-xenografts in SCID mice with vemurafenib until
the emergence of resistance then obtained “in vivo” the
resistant sub-line, A375RIV (Supplemetary Fig.1A). This
protocol phenocopies the situation observed in patients.
Unlike the parental sensitive cells, we confirmed the
resistant status of A375C3, A375RIV, SKMel28V3,
WM9R sub-lines in cell survival (Fig. 2A, upper panel)
and longer-term clonogenic assays (Fig. 2A, lower panel).
No elevated levels of BRAF or alternatively splices
isoforms (61 kDa, [19]) were found in the resistant
sub-lines (Suplementary Fig. 1B). Genomic analyses
did not revealed classical secondary mutations such as
NRASQ61K, KRASK117N, MEKC121S in the resistant sublines (Supplementary Table 1). To further explore the
mechanisms of resistance, we examined the activation
status of BRAF downstream targets, MEK and ERK,
as well as the RTK-dependent stimulation of Akt in
vemurafenib-sensitive and derived-resistant sub-lines
(Fig. 2B). Vemurafenib caused dose-dependent decreases
in p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 in all sensitive cell lines
whereas all 4 resistant sub-lines maintained elevated levels
of p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 upon vemurafenib exposure.
However, the levels of p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 as well
as those of p-Akt differed among the resistant sub-lines
suggesting distinct mechanisms of resistance (Fig. 2B).
Besides, only WM9R cells remained resistant to the
MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, indicating that they activated
new survival signalling pathways in the presence of
vemurafenib (Fig. 2C). In addition, PDGFRβ mRNA
was found upregulated in the SKMel28V3 resistant
sub-line insinuating that the activation of a PDGFRβdependent pathway is involved in SKMel28V3 resistance
to vemurafenib (Fig.2D). Since activation of multiple
RTKs by various ligands can be responsible for acquired
resistance to kinase inhibitors [20], we tested the effect
of conditioned media from vemurafenib-resistant sublines on sensitivity to vemurafenib in parental cells. Of
note, only the A375RIV conditioned medium transferred
vemurafenib resistance to the parental A375 cells
suggesting that resistance of A375RIV was sustained by
autocrine/paracrine survival mechanisms (Fig.2E). Thus,
although the precise mechanisms remain to be determined,
we have generated a panel of human melanoma cell
lines with diverse mechanisms of acquired resistance to
vemurafenib.
In these models of vemurafenib resistance, we next

Vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells are
prone to cell death induced by the pro-oxidant
elesclomol

Consistent with our previous data [13], elesclomol induced
a dose-dependent increase in intracellular ROS generation
and melanoma cell death (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, cell
death induced by elesclomol was remarkably higher
in vemurafenib-resistant cell lines than in parental
cells (Fig. 4A and 4B), consistent with the high level
of mitochondrial oxidative stress observed in resistant
cells (Fig. 3). High oxidative toxicity was also observed
in vemurafenib-resistant cells incubated with other prooxidative drugs such as the mitochondrial ROS inducers,
menadione, and phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC)
(supplementary Fig.3A and 3B). We then set out to
determine the antimelanoma effects of elesclomol in vivo
in SCID mice xenografted with the vemurafenib-resistant
human cell line, A375C3. Whereas A375C3 tumors
continued to grow despite treatment with vemurafenib,
animals treated with elesclomol had significantly
smaller A375C3 tumors (Fig. 4C). The in vivo effect

The observation that resistance to vemurafenib
inevitably occurs in melanoma cells points out the need
to develop new strategies to kill vemurafenib-resistant
cells by other mechanisms. Since FCCP induced cell
death preferentially in vemurafenib-resistant cells (Fig.
3G), we hypothesized that the constant increase in ROS
production observed in vemurafenib-resistant cells would
render these cells more sensitive to further oxidative
stress by exogenous agent. We tested this possibility using
elesclomol, a pro-oxidative drug that displays clinical
anti-melanoma activity [22]. Elesclomol has been shown
to pick up electrons from the mitochondrial ETC and the
subsequent electron leakage causes oxidative stress [23].

DISCUSSION

of elesclomol on tumor growth was associated with the
occurrence of apoptosis (Fig. 4D) and the decrease in
cell proliferation (Fig. 4E). Besides, substantial increase
of ROS and cell death was also observed in vitro after
elesclomol exposure in cells isolated from a patient with
metastatic BRAFV600E-bearing melanoma, who escaped
to treatment with vemurafenib (Fig. 5A and 5B). The
ability of elesclomol to reduced melanoma growth was
finally confirmed in vivo by engrafting SCID mice with
vemurafenib-resistant tumor fragments obtained from
the same patient (Fig. 5C). Overall, melanomas with
acquired resistance to vemurafenib remain sensitive to
the pro-oxidant, elesclomol suggesting that mitochondrial
pro-oxidants may have a potential for treatment of
vemurafenib-resistant melanoma in the clinic.

Like many types of cancer, the vast majority of
melanomas adopts a Warburg phenotype that renders
them predominantly dependent on aerobic glycolysis for
survival and proliferation [13-15]. However, it is now
evident that mitochondria in human melanoma cells
do not remain inactive and exhibit specific functional
characteristics. Melanoma cells maintain entirely
functional mitochondria that can metabolize carbons
derived from glutamine and glucose for anabolic purposes
[14]. This is further supported by the observation that
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism can be unlocked by
inhibition of the HIF-1/PDK signalling pathway [13]. Very
recently, two reports have revealed key mechanisms of
melanoma oxidative metabolism [15,18]. The metabolic
phenotype of melanoma is heterogeneous and is largely

dependent on the expression of the positive regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis, PGC1α, found in approximately
10 % of melanoma [15]. PGC1α positive cells display
high rates of oxidative phosphorylation and appear to
be addicted to oxidative metabolism for survival [15].
Mechanistically, the expression of PGC1α is directly
under control of the lineage specific transcription
factor, MITF [15,18] and the activating BRAFV600E
mutation suppress MITF expression, which, in turn,
reduces PGC1α and subsequently curtails mitochondrial
metabolism [18]. As predicted by these relationships,
inhibition of B-RAF with specific inhibitors such as
vemurafenib increases the expression of MITF and
PGC1α [18]. Our results complement these data [18]
demonstrating that vemurafenib increases mitochondrial
respiration and ROS generation in melanoma cells. Our
results also indicate that BRAF inhibitors can increase

mitochondrial metabolism through a PGC1α independent
mechanism. Multiple factors can influence mitochondrial
metabolism. Lessons from the PGC1α null mice indicate
that PGC1α do not appear to be the sole determinant of
mitochondrial biogenesis [24] and other proteins of the
PGC1 family including PGC1β and the PGC1-related
coactivator (PRC), are regulated coactivators which may
boost respiration to meet energy needs associated with
cell growth [25]. Irrespective of the mechanisms, we have
shown that pre-incubation with inhibitors of mitochondrial
function renders melanoma cells more sensitive to BRAF
inhibitors. Haq and colleagues [18] have also recognised
mitochondrial activity as a significant hurdle to the
cytotoxic effect of vemurafenib. In line with this, the BcrAbl specific inhibitor, imatinib stimulates mitochondrial
activities contributing to limit its anti-leukemia effects
[26]. Since mitochondrial oxidative metabolism triggered
by vemurafenib constitutes a brake on the cytotoxicity
induced by BRAF inhibitors, one can hypothesize that
cells that can survive in the presence of vemurafenib are
those characterized by high mitochondrial activity.
Herein, we have identified mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism as a metabolic signature of resistance to
BRAF inhibitors. We employed four independent models
of resistance for this investigation in an attempt to better
mimic diversity in mechanisms of acquired resistance in
the clinic. We have observed that vemurafenib-resistant
cells, which sustain high levels of MAPK signalling,
displayed a significant increase in respiration rates as
well as high levels of mitochondrial superoxide anion
compared to sensitive cells. This is consistent with the
observation that the enforced expression of oncogenic
BRAFV600E in fibroblasts is sufficient to promote
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism characterized by
high level of pyruvate oxidation, respiration and rise in
oxidative stress [17]. Interestingly, the mitochondrial
oxidative phenotype has been involved in the resistance
to classical chemotherapy and BRAF inhibitors in the
slow-cycling subpopulation of melanoma characterized
by high expression of the lysine-specific demethylase 5B
(KDM5B a.k.a. JARID1B) [27]. As previously suggested
[28], response to oncogene inhibition depends not only
on driven oncogenes but also on adaptative conditions
selected during melanomagenesis.
Cancer metabolism is now considered as an
emerging source of new targets for cancer therapy [29].
These results identify mitochondria as potential targets for
the treatment of melanoma resistant to BRAF inhibitors.
Vemurafenib-induced oxidative metabolism renders
melanoma cells highly dependent on antioxidant enzymes
to cope with oxidative stress. One can then hypothesize
that vemurafenib-resistant cells, which survive in the
presence of vemurafenib, possess sufficient adaptive
antioxidant mechanisms to tolerate the chronic excess
of ROS. Thus, it is not surprising that we observed
an increase in the level of glutathione and catalase in

vemurafenib-resistant cells. In this situation, a further
oxidative stress (e.g. induced by pro-oxidative drugs)
could exhaust the antioxidant defence and push cells
beyond the oxidative level where cell death can occur [30].
This may explain why vemurafenib-resistant cells with
increased endogenous ROS are more sensitive to cell death
induced by mitochondrial pro-oxidative agents. Since cell
lines resistant to vemurafenib displayed an important
activity in the respiratory chain, we have exposed them to
the pro-oxidative drug, elesclomol. Elesclomol combined
with copper targets the mitochondrial electron chain and
induces a respiratory-dependent ROS production [23].
Elesclomol was evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial for
the treatment of metastatic melanoma with encouraging
results [22] and is currently being evaluated in a Phase I
trial in the treatment of AML (clinicaltrials.gov).
Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibition is
currently a critical area of investigation. Results obtained
in recent years suggest that resistance to vemurafenib
can occur by multiple distinct mechanisms that are
totally unpredictable. In our present study, we suggest a
global strategy consisting to exploit a general hallmark
of melanoma cells that have acquired resistance to
vemurafenib regardless the mutation profile. In addition
to increasing pro-oxidative stress, HSP90 inhibition or
ER stress inducers have been also shown to be valuable
therapeutic targets in BRAF mutant melanoma [31,32]
enabling to overcome acquired resistance to vemurafenib
[32,33].
In conclusion, we propose a new paradigm in
therapeutic strategy aimed at increasing mitochondrial
oxidative stress to eradicate melanoma resistant to BRAF
inhibitors.

these samples, four were used for in vivo experiments and
the remaining samples were used for in vitro experiments
as described below. Besides, blood plasma samples were
obtained from 8 patients with BRAFV600E mutant
melanoma the day before and 30 days after vemurafenib
at a dose of 960 mg twice daily.

Cell culture and derivation of vemurafenibresistant cell lines
A375 and SKMel28 human melanoma cell
lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and WM9 human melanoma cell line was
obtained by a kind gift from a Dr. M. Herlyn (The
Wistar Institute, Philadelphia). All cell lines have been
found to harbour BRAFV600E mutation. To generate
cell line with in vitro acquired resistance, BRAFV600E
mutant cell lines (A375, SKMel28, WM9) sensitive to
vemurafenib, were treated with different concentrations
(approximately 3xIC50, 10xIC50 of the sensitive cell
line) of vemurafenib for 2-3 months until a subline grew
progressively as described [10,34]. Vemurafenib-resistant
cells were cloned in 3µM vemurafenib, a concentration
at which parental cells were not viable. Vemurafenibresistant cells obtained in vitro were designated A375C3,
SKMel28V3 and WM9R. Trypan blue exclusion assay
was regularly performed to check resistance status. For
the obtention of the A375RIV vemurafenib-resistant
cell line, we used human melanoma xenograft models
in which drug resistance is selected by continuous
vemurafenib administration in immunocompromised
mice (Supplementary Fig. S1). Briefly, A375 orthotopic
tumors were grown to 300 mm3 before treatment with
vemurafenib (75mg/kg/day by oral gavage). Tumor
growth was inhibited for 45 days of treatment, at which
time one tumor rapidly progressed. The occurrence of
resistance is in line with clinical data in humans. Once
this tumor reached a volume of 1500 mm3, the mouse
was euthanized, and tumor tissue was removed and
primary cell culture was established. Tumor tissue was
minced in a sterile glass Petri dish then incubated at 37°c
for 150 minutes with an enzyme cocktail of serum-free
DMEM (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing 8 mg/
ml collagenase-1 and 5 mg/ml dispase. This mixture was
incubated for an additional 30 minutes with 1ml of trypsin
0.05%. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition
of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were grown to allow
elimination of contaminating fibroblasts before further
study. Cell lines were maintained in RPMI (except for
SKMEL28, SKMEL28V3 in DMEM) with 10% FCS and
were periodically tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Mutational analysis of NRAS, BRAF, and MEK
by direct PCR product sequencing

then colonies were de-stained in acetic acid (30%) before
densitometric quantification with the SAFAS UVMc2
spectrophotometer (Safas Monaco).

Mutational analysis of MAP2K1/C121S, NRAS/
Q61K and KRAS/K117N was performed in all of
vemurafenib-resistant cell lines using direct PCR product
sequencing on the mutated hotspots of these genes.
Purification, adaptators ligation, barcoding, template
preparation (emPCR) were done on the One-Touch systen
(Lifetechnologies) and sequencing reactions on the Ion
Torrent PGM (Lifetechnologies) following manufacturer’s
recommandations.

Cytofluorometric analysis
Evaluation of cell viability was performed following
with propidium iodide staining[13,35]. Detection of ROS
was assessed with several oxidation sensitive fluorescent
probes such as hydroethidine (HE), mitochondria-targeted
HE (Mito-SOX) and CM-H2DCFDA following classical
protocols [13,35]. Alternatively, cells were transiently
transfected with 1 µg of plasmid DNA encoding
redox-sensitive green fluorescent proteins targeted
to mitochondria (Hyper-mito, Evrogen) as described
[21]. Fluorescence was analyzed on a FACS Canto II
cytofluorometer (Beckton Dickinson).

Immunoblotting
Cell lysates were prepared as described previously
[13] then 20 µg proteins were separated on a 4-12%
SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.
After blocking for 1 h in 10% BSA in TBS Tween buffer,
membranes were probed with the following antibodies
specific for Akt (1:1,000, #9272, Cell Signaling
Technology Inc., Denvers, MA), phospho-Akt at Ser473
(1:1,000, 193H12, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.),
p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (1:1,000, #9102, Cell Signaling
Technology Inc.), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2)
at Thr202/Tyr204 (1:1,000, #9101, Cell Signaling
Technology Inc.), MEK1/2 (1:1,000, #9122, Cell
Signaling Technology Inc.), phosphor-MEK1/2 (1:1,000,
#9121, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from
Rockland Immunochemicals Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA) were
used at 1:2,000 for 1h then detection was carried out by
enhanced chemoluminescence. For detection of OXPHOS
complexes, monoclonal antibodies from MitoSciences
were used as described [35].

Glutathione status
Glutathione status (i.e. glutathione disulfide, GSSG/
reduced glutathione, GSH) was determined in cell pellets
by using high-performance liquid chromatography with
fluorescence detection, as published [36].

Determination of malondialdehyde (MDA)
MDA concentrations was determined in cell pellets
and plasma samples by using high-performance liquid
chromatography with fluorescence detection, as published
[37].

PCR analysis
Quantitative detection of mRNA was performed by
real-time PCR using the Lightcycler 480 detector (Roche
Applied Science, Manheim Germany) and comparison
was done with the Pfafll method as described [35]. The
transcript levels in triplicates were normalized to those
of α4 tubulin. The sequences of primers are: PPARGC1A
(PGC1α) sense 5’-CTGCTAGCAAGTTTGCCTCA-3’
and antisense 5’-AGTGGTGCAGTGACCAATCA-3’ and
α4 tubulin 5’-GACAGCTCTTCCACCCAGAG-3’ and
antisense 5’-TGAAGTCCTGTGCACTGGTC-3’.

Microscopic imaging
Indicated cell lines were transiently transfected
with a plasmid encoding mitochondrially-targeted red
fluorescent protein (pDsRed2-Mito, Clontech Laboratories
Inc., 0.5µg/200,000 cells) using Lipofectamine PLUS
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
pDsRed2-Mito-transfected cells were seeded on 24mm
glass coverslip for 24h before microscopic analysis (Leica
DMR, Heidelberg, Germany). pDsRed2-Mito was excited
at 594nm under x630 magnification before acquisition.

In vivo study
All procedures with animals were performed
according to institutional guidelines for use of laboratory
animals (agreement provided by the Animal Care Ethical
Committee). Immunodeficient female SCID mice, 6
to 8 wk old, under isoflurane anesthesia were injected
with 2x106 A375C3 cells, mixed (1 :1 volume) with BD
Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix. Tumor volume was
calculated with a caliper by the standard formula L x l2
/ 2. When tumors reached approximately 400 mm3, the
mice were divided into four groups: Control group n=4:
mice were treated with saline with the same schedule
as the treated animals; Elesclomol 10 mg/kg group n=6
(elesclomol 10 mg/kg, i.v. injection for 5days/week);
Elesclomol 20 mg/kg group n=6 (elesclomol 20 mg/
kg, i.v. injection for 5days/week); vemurafenib group
n=4 (vemurafenib administrated by oral gavage, 75 mg/
kg/j). For patient-derived tumor implanted in mice, fresh
tumor samples were minced into small pieces, mixed (1 :1
volume) with Matrigel then injected into the flank of SCID
mice as described above.
