ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype.
The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of both miR-101 and
MCL-1 in the sensitivity of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to paclitaxel.
We found that the expression of miR-101 was strongly decreased in triple-negative
breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The expression of miR-101 was not associated
with clinical stage or lymph node infiltration in TNBC. Ectopic overexpression of miR101 inhibit growth and induced apoptosis in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity
in vivo. MCL-1 was significantly overexpressed in most of the TNBC tissues and cell
lines. Luciferase assay results confirmed MCL-1 as a direct target gene of miR-101.
MiR-101 inhibited MCL-1 expression in TNBC cells and transplanted tumors. There
was a negative correlation between the level of expression of miR-101 and MCL-1 in
TNBC tissues. Suppression of MCL-1 enhanced the sensitivity of MDA-MB-435 cells to
paclitaxel. Furthermore, miR-101 increased paclitaxel sensitivity by inhibiting MCL-1
expression. Our findings provide significant insight into the molecular mechanisms of
TNBC carcinogenesis and may have clinical relevance for the development of novel,
targeted therapies for TNBC.

INTRODUCTION

is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. TNBC has
a high propensity for metastasis and a poor prognosis
[4]. Current treatment modalities for TNBC are limited
to surgery, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy due to
the lack of more specific therapeutic targets. However,
patients often experience early relapse from distant
tumor metastasis even if they initially respond well to the
treatments. Over the past few decades, tremendous effort
has been expended in the search for a molecular targeted
therapy for TNBC with limited success [5].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding,
endogenous RNA molecules involved in gene regulation
that are located in introns of protein-coding genes,
introns of non-coding genes, or exons of non-coding
genes. These small (18–25 nucleotides long) non-coding
RNAs function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene

Breast cancer, the most common malignancy in
women, is a heterogeneous disease with substantial
diversity in histological and molecular characteristics that
require specialized therapeutic interventions [1]. Most
cases are classified as ‘sporadic’ breast carcinoma caused
by genetic changes that occur over time [2], and only a
small percentage (5-10%) of cases are of hereditary origin.
The estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR)
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are
the molecular biomarkers currently used in routine clinical
practice to help make treatment decisions for breast cancer
[3]. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which was
named for the absence of ER, PR, and HER2 expression,

expression by binding to the 3’ untranslated region (UTR)
of target mRNAs and promoting mRNA degradation or
translational repression[6]. Several studies demonstrated
that miRNAs can inhibit the expression of oncogenes and
tumor suppressors [7].
Furthermore, several miRNAs that play a crucial
role in TNBC biology have been identified, and these
miRNAs may have therapeutic implications. The causal
involvement of microRNAs in breast cancer and the
possible use of these small non-coding RNA molecules
as biomarkers have been extensively studied, and those
studies have generated promising results. Utilizing
miRNAs as a therapeutic tool might be an innovative
treatment approach, especially for tumor subgroups, such
as TNBC, which cannot be treated with efficient and
specific therapies [8]. In breast cancer, miRNA expression
profiling using microarray technology, combined with
some histopathological features, such as ER, PR and HER2
status, has been established as a useful tool for classifying
tumors [9]. MicroRNA-101 (miR-101) expression is
negatively associated with tumor growth and blood vessel
formation in several solid epithelial cancers, including
breast cancer. Researchers have confirmed that miR-101
acts as a tumor suppressor in gliomas [10]. The expression
of miR-101 was decreased in human breast cancer tissues
and inhibited cellular proliferation as well as invasiveness
by targeting Stmn1 [11]. MAGI-2 suppression by miR-101
reduces PTEN activity, leading to Akt activation in MCF-7
breast cancer cells [12]. However, the role of miR-101 in
TNBC remains elusive.
Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), a pro-survival
member of the Bcl-2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) family,
has been associated with the aberrant expression of prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins and tumorigenesis as well
as resistance to chemotherapies [13]. Previous studies
have demonstrated that several miRNAs induce apoptosis
by targeting MCL-1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [14],
acute myeloid leukemia [15] and ovarian cancer [16].
Our previous study showed that MCL-1 could be targeted
with miR-26a in breast cancer [17]. Although studies have
shown that MCL-1 is a target of miR-101 in lung cancer
[18] and endometrial cancer cells [19], the roles of MCL-1
and miR-101 in drug sensitivity have not been identified.
The goal of the present study was to identify
“druggable” targets for TNBC to develop new treatment
options. In this study, we analyzed the expression of
miR-101 by using a triple-negative breast cancer tissue
microarray. Previous investigations led us to study MCL1, a putative target of miR-101. After demonstrating the
mechanism of miR-101 in in vitro and in vivo models,
we hypothesized that miR-101 could be involved in the
pathogenesis of breast cancer. In this study, miR-101 was
considered a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.

Expression of miR-101 is decreased in TNBC cell
lines and tissues
The miR-101 expression was decreased in seven of
the eight breast cancer cell lines (BT-483, T47D, MCF7, SKBR3, BT-474, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and
MDA-MB-468) compared to the normal human mammary
epithelial cell line MCF-10A (Figure 1A). These results
indicated that miR-101 had lower expression in basallike cell lines compared to luminal cell lines. qRT-PCR
revealed a decrease in miR-101 expression in 16 of 22
TNBC samples (72.7%) (Figure 1B). Then, using ISH, we
found that miR-101 expression was decreased in 56 of 86
samples (65.1%) (Figure 1C). No significant correlations
between miR-101 expression and age or tumor size were
found (Table 2).

MiR-101 suppresses the proliferation, apoptosis
and tumorigenic capacity of TNBC cells
To explore the functional effects of miR-101 in
TNBC cells, we performed an MTT assay, flow cytometry
analysis and JC-1 staining in MDA-MB-435 and MDAMB-468 cells. As shown in Figure 2A, the rate of cell
survival was considerably lower for cells transfected with
miR-101 mimics compared to the respective controls.
By contrast, the inhibition of miR-101 by miR-101LNA significantly increased cell survival compared to
the control (Figure 2A). To assess whether this effect is
mediated through the induction of cell apoptosis, flow
cytometry analysis and JC-1 staining were performed.
The rate of apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells was
increased following transfection with miR-101 mimics.
Meanwhile, the inhibition of miR-101 suppressed cell
apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells (Figure 2C). We found
that the overexpression of miR-101 resulted in reduced
MMP and increased green fluorescence in MDA-MB-435
cells (Figure 2D). Consistent with the in vitro results, the
in vivo growth rate of MDA-MB-435 cells transfected
with miR-101 mimics was significantly slower than the
growth rate of the controls, while the miR-101-LNA
group demonstrated a faster growth rate (Figure 2E).
These observations provide strong evidence that the
overexpression of miR-101 significantly suppresses the
growth of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo.

of miR-101 decreased paclitaxel sensitivity in MDAMB-435 cells (Figure 3A). Our results showed that
enhanced expression of miR-101 caused a significant
reduction in MMP, an increase in green fluorescence and
an increase in the rate of apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells
after paclitaxel treatment (Figure 3B and 3C). To further
confirm these results, the levels of apoptotic markers were
detected in transfected MDA-MB-435 cells by Western
blot analysis after treatment with paclitaxel. First, we
detected the effect of paclitaxel on apoptosis in MDAMB-435 cells. Increasing doses of paclitaxel enhanced the
expression of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP (Figure 3D).

targets in human TNBC. Among the candidate target
genes, the algorithm predicted MCL-1 as a target (Figure

decreased luciferase expression of the MCL1-3’-UTRwt reporter. By contrast, no change in relative luciferase
expression was observed in cells transfected with the
MCL1-3’-UTR-mut reporter (Figure 4B). These results
suggest that MCL-1 is a direct target of miR-101. The
results of qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed
that enhanced expression of miR-101 by miR-101
mimics in MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells led
to the downregulation of endogenous MCL-1 mRNA and
decreased protein levels. Accordingly, the inhibition of
endogenous miR-101 by a miR-101 inhibitor (miR-101LNA) resulted in the upregulation of endogenous MCL-1
mRNA and protein levels compared to the negative control
(Figure 4C and 4D). In transplanted tumors, the expression
of MCL-1 was decreased in the miR-101-treated group
(Figure 4E). The expression of MCL-1 mRNA was
significantly increased in 77.2% (17/22) of tumor tissues
(Figure 4F), and the protein level was overexpressed in
all three TNBC cell lines (Figure 4H). Furthermore, miR101 expression was negatively correlated with MCL-1
expression in TNBC tissues (R = 0.555, P < 0.001; Figure
4G).

MCL-1 knockdown could erase the effect of the miR-101
inhibitor (Figure 5B). MCL-1 overexpression decreased
the rate of apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells. miR-101
recovered the effect of MCL-1 suppression on apoptosis
in MDA-MB-435 cells. MCL-1 knockdown increased
the rate of apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells. miR-101
inhibition interrupted the induction of apoptosis in MDAMB-435 cells by MCL-1 siRNA (Figure 5C). MCL-1
knockdown resulted in reduced MMP and increased green
fluorescence. Additionally, the overexpression of MCL-1
could attenuate the effect of miR-101 on MMP in MDAMB-435 cells (Figure 5D). The upregulation of MCL1 suppressed the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and
cleaved PARP, and this effect on MCL-1 was weakened
by miR-101. Conversely, inhibition of MCL-1 enhanced
the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, and this
effect on MCL-1 was abated by miR-101 (Figure 5E).

MCL-1 mediates miR-101-induced paclitaxel
sensitivity in TNBC cells
MCL-1 overexpression promotes the proliferation
of MDA-MB-435 cells incubated with different doses of
paclitaxel. By contrast, MCL-1 knockdown suppressed
cell proliferation (Figure 6A). In paclitaxel-treated MDAMB-435 cells, miR-101 induced green fluorescence.
There was still orange fluorescence after co-transfection
with a MCL-1-overexpressing vector and miR-101 in
MDA-MB-435 cells (Figure 6B). These results indicated
that MCL-1 overexpression could attenuate the effect of
miR-101 on MMP in MDA-MB-435 cells. Additionally,
MCL-1 overexpression could attenuate paclitaxel or
paclitaxel combined with miR-101-induced apoptosis
in MDA-MB-435 cells (Figure 6C). In addition, MCL-1

compared to the control (Figure 5A). In MDA-MB-468

and progression, including breast cancer [7, 10, 20, 21].
While it has been reported previously that suppression
of miR-101 leads to the overexpression of MCL-1 in
hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer
[18, 22], the relationship between MCL-1 and miR-101
and their biological relevance in breast cancer have not yet
been fully determined, especially in TNBC. In this study,
the expression of miR-101 was decreased and inversely
correlated with MCL-1 expression in all basal-like cell

DISCUSSION
Emerging research has demonstrated that
miRNAs play important roles in tumor development

lines and in the majority of TNBC tissues. The results
from the luciferase reporter assays confirmed that MCL-1
represents a direct target gene of miR-101 in TNBC cells.

We assessed the effect of miR-101 and MCL-1 on breast
cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo. Using two TNBC
cell lines, we were able to show that miR-101 suppress

the expression of MCL-1, both at the transcriptional and
the post-transcriptional level. miR-101 overexpression
significantly suppressed proliferation in vitro. These
effects appeared to be mediated by inhibition of the MCL1 oncogene, which led to cell apoptosis. Furthermore,
transfection of miR-101 mimics effectively suppressed
the tumorigenicity of TNBC cells in a nude mouse model.
Other studies have obtained similar results. Specifically,
miR-101 suppressed tumor progression by targeting MCL1 in hepatocellular carcinoma [23] and lung cancer [24].
Studies performed by Koss B [25] indicate that
endogenous MCL-1 has anti-apoptotic activity that
promotes survival during BCR-ABL transformation in
established BCR-ABL(+) leukemia. MCL-1 mediates the
inhibition of osteosarcoma pathogenesis by miR-133a
[26]. MCL-1 is overexpressed in human glioblastoma,
which confers a survival advantage to tumor cells.
Inhibition of MCL-1 potentiates temozolomide-induced
apoptosis in gliomas [27]. In our study, we were able to
show that the suppression of MCL-1 significantly inhibits
proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro.
Apoptosis is a critical part of various biological
processes, and it represents a regulated cellular
suicide mechanism that is characterized by nuclear
condensation, cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and
DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis is also involved in
carcinogenesis. It has been reported that miRNAs play
important roles in inducing apoptosis [28] and sensitizing
tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents [29]. For example,
Wang and colleagues have demonstrated that miR-101
sensitizes human bladder cancer cells to gambogic acidinduced apoptosis by inhibiting EZH2 expression [30].
Although a number of effective options have been
developed for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing
diseases, TNBC remains a subtype that is difficult to treat.
Taxanes are considered to be some of the most active
classes of compounds that work against breast cancer
[31], but a major obstacle remains for successful cancer
treatment. Paclitaxel inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis in a variety of cancers. Shi et al. demonstrated
that a PARP inhibitor reduces proliferation and increases
apoptosis in breast cancer cells[32]. Additional data
has shown that paclitaxel can induce apoptosis in
human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a caspasedependent manner. In our study, we were able to show
that miR-101-mediated MCL-1 silencing sensitized
TNBC cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, whereas
antagomir-mediated downregulation of endogenous
miR-101 reversed the apoptotic effect. Future studies
are needed to further elucidate the signaling pathways
that control miR-101-mediated apoptosis in TNBC. In
this study, we demonstrated that the overexpression of
miR-101 enhanced the expression of apoptosis-related
cleaved caspase 3 and PARP by targeting MCL-1 and
that miR-101 could enhance the expression of paclitaxelinduced cleaved caspase 3 and PARP in TNBC cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

These results show that miR-101 transfection increases
chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in TNBC.
Our data suggest that the tumor suppressor miR-101
represses TNBC progression and sensitizes TNBC cells
to paclitaxel treatment by directly targeting MCL-1. Our
findings provide significant insights into the molecular
mechanisms underlying breast carcinogenesis and may
have relevance for the development of novel, targeted
therapies for TNBC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and transfection
The following cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA)
and were passaged in our laboratory for less than six
months after the frozen aliquots were thawed: five breast
cancer cell lines with a luminal transcriptional profile (BT483, T47D, MCF-7, SKBR3 and BT-474), three breast
cancer cell lines with a basal-like transcriptional profile
(MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) and
a normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). Basallike breast cancer is also known as triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) [33]. All cells were maintained according
to the supplier’s instructions. Before use, all cell lines were
authenticated with short tandem repeat DNA profiling and
were found to be free of mycoplasma infection. Plasmids,
miRNAs, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were
transfected into the cells at the indicated concentrations
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Clinical samples
Tissue samples from 22 cases of TNBC and the
corresponding paired normal adjacent tissues, collected
from September 2010 to May 2011 (Table 1), were
analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
Resected cancerous tissues and paired normal mammary
tissues were immediately cut into pieces and stored in
RNAlater (Ambion). The tissue microarrays consisted of
86 TNBC tissues (including the 22 collected samples).
Histopathology was used to confirm TNBC in the samples
collected from September 2010 to September 2012. The
matched paracarcinoma tissues were used as the control
samples. The specimens were stored in the Department
of Specimens and Resources at Sun Yat-Sen University
Cancer Center. The specimens were obtained during
surgery and were formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin
using standard methods. Immunohistochemistry of ER,
PR and HER2 expression was performed in the Pathology
Department of Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center.

and reviewed, including age, histologic type, lymph node
status, tumor size, stage, local relapse, distant metastatic
relapse, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status. Histologic
type was based on the TNM staging system, and the
types were reclassified according to WHO classification
and tumor stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer
classification). Patient follow-up included a review of their
records and telephone calls. The patients were grouped
according to age, lymph node status, tumor size and stage.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center Health Authority.
Written informed consent for participation in the study
was obtained from all participants. The procedures for
collecting and using tissues from the patients were in
accordance with the ethical standards established in the
Declaration of Helsinki.

stained.

Vector construct
An MCL-1-expressing vector was constructed. Fulllength MCL-1 cDNA was purchased from GeneCopoeia
TM (USA) and was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+)
vector. The 3’UTR of MCL-1 (pMIR-MCL-1) or the
3’UTR with mutated binding sites for miR-101 (pMIRMCL-1-mut) was synthesized by Invitrogen (China) and
inserted into pMIR-REPORT, which expresses the firefly
luciferase plasmid (Promega).

Dual-Luciferase reporter assay and 3’UTR
binding site mutagenesis
MDA-MB-435 cells (6×104) were seeded in 24well plates immediately prior to transfection. The pMIRMcl1 and pMIR-Mcl1-mut constructs were transfected
into MDA-MB-435 cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The miR-101 mimic was co-transfected where indicated.
Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were
assayed for both firefly and renilla luciferase with the
dual luciferase glow assay (Promega). Transfection
experiments were performed in duplicate, and each
experiment was repeated at least three times.

qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Reverse transcription
and qRT-PCR reactions were performed with a SYBRgreen-containing PCR kit (Qiagen, Germantown, USA).
The fold change was determined as 2-ΔΔCt. The Ct is the
fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence of each
sample passes the fixed threshold. ΔCt was calculated
by subtracting the Ct of snRNA U6 from the Ct of the
miRNA of interest. ΔΔCt was calculated by subtracting
the ΔCt of the reference sample (paired non-tumorous
tissue for the surgical samples) from the ΔCt of each
sample. The primers for qRT-PCR detection of MCL1 mRNA (F: TAAGGACAAAACGGGACTGG; R:
CCTCTTGCCACTTGCTTTTC) were synthesized by
Invitrogen. All qRT-PCR was performed with a Bio-Rad
C1000 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System
(USA).

Cell proliferation assay and cell apoptosis analysis
Cell proliferation at 48 h was determined using the
cell proliferation reagent MTT (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For cell apoptosis analysis, the cells were
transfected as described in the previous section, and the
apoptotic rate was detected with Annexin V/FITC staining
and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur flow cytometer; BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

In situ hybridization (ISH) analysis

Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP, Δψm) using JC-1

In situ hybridization procedures were carried out
as previously described. miR-101 miRCURYTM LNA
custom detection probes (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark)
were used for ISH. The 5’-3’ sequence (enhanced with
LNA) was UACAGUACUGUGAUAACUGAA with
digoxigenin (DIG) at the 5’ and 3’ ends. Hybridization,
washing, and scanning were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Staining intensity was scored
as 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (medium) or 3+ (strong).
Low expression was defined as a staining intensity of 0,
1, 2 or 3 with < 10% of cells being stained or an intensity
of 0 or 1 with < 50% of cells stained. High expression
was defined as an intensity of 2 or 3 with < 10% of cells
stained or an intensity of 1, 2 or 3 with < 50% of cells

To measure the mitochondrial membrane potential
(Δψm), 5,5’,6,6’-tetrachloro-1,1’,3,3’-tetraethylbenzim
idazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), which is a sensitive
fluorescent probe kit for Δψm, was used on the cells
(Biyuntian Biochemistry Limited Company, China).
Treated or untreated cells were cultured in 24-well plates
for 24 h, washed with PBS and incubated with a working
solution of JC-1 for 20 min at 37°C. Then, the cells were
rinsed twice with PBS, stained with 1 mL of 10% DMEM
medium containing 5 μmol/L JC-1, resuspended in 1 mL
of ice-cold PBS, washed with PBS and resuspended in
500 μL of PBS. The stained cells were analyzed using a

received intratumoral injections twice a week for three
consecutive weeks. Mouse weight and tumor progression
were monitored daily using the IVIS system with Living
Imaging software (Xenogen). On day 32, the mice were
euthanized by spinal dislocation, and the tumors and hearts
were immediately harvested, weighed, and analyzed.
All experiments were performed in accordance with
institutional guidelines and were approved by the animal
care and use committee at the University of Sun Yat-Sen
University Cancer Center.

Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemical staining was performed
using an UltraSensitive S-P Kit (Maixin Biotechnology
Company, Fuzhou, China). The color was developed
using DAB as the chromogen. Then, the slides were
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin and mounted
for evaluation under a microscope (OLYMPUS BX-51,
Osaka, Japan). Two independent pathologists who were
blinded to the clinicopathological information scored the
samples. Staining was scored for intensity (1, 0+; 2, 1+;
3, 2+; 4, 3+) as well as the percentage of membranous
and cytoplasmic staining in malignant cells (1, 0-25%;
2, 26-50%; 3, 51-75%; 4, 76-100%). The final score was
obtained by multiplying the intensity score by the score
for the percentage counts. A score of < 8 was considered
to be low expression, and a score of > 8 was considered to
be high expression.

Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as the mean ± standard
error of the mean. All experiments using cell lines were
repeated a minimum of 3 times. Statistical significance
was reported if the p-value was < 0.05 using an unpaired
Student’s t-test.

REFERENCES

To investigate the antitumor effects of miR-101 in
vivo, female BALB/c-nude mice (4–6 weeks old; Vital
River Laboratories Animal, Beijing, China) were injected
subcutaneously in the right fourth mammary gland with
5×106 MDA-MB-435-Luc cells in 100 μL of PBS with
a 30-gauge needle. Tumor formation was monitored by
palpation, and tumor size was measured twice per week
using calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the
standard formula: tumor volume = (width2×length×π)/6.
When the tumors reached ~50 mm3, the mice were
noninvasively imaged using the IVIS In Vivo Imaging
System (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) to confirm tumor
growth. Then, the mice were randomly assigned to one
of four groups (n = 10 mice per group): miR-LNA, miR101-LNA, miR-scramble or miR-101 mimics. All groups
