ABSTRACT
Obscurins are RhoGEF-containing proteins whose downregulation has been
implicated in the development and progression of breast cancer. Herein, we aim
to elucidate the mechanism for increased motility of obscurin-deficient cells. We
show that shRNA-mediated obscurin downregulation in MCF10A cells leads to >50%
reduction in RhoA activity relative to scramble control (shCtrl), as well as decreased
phosphorylation of RhoA effectors, including myosin light chain phosphatase, myosin
light chain, lim kinase, and cofilin, in both attached and suspended cells. These
alterations result in decreased actomyosin contractility, allowing suspended cells
to escape detachment-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ~40% of shObsc-expressing
cells, but only ~10% of shCtrl-expressing cells, extend microtentacles, tubulin-based
projections that mediate the attachment of circulating tumor cells to endothelium.
Indeed, we show that MCF10A cells expressing shObsc attach in vitro more readily
than shCtrl cells, an advantage that persists following taxane exposure. Overall, our
data suggest that loss of obscurins may represent a substantial selective advantage
for breast epithelial cells during metastasis, and that treatment with paclitaxel may
exacerbate this advantage by preferentially allowing obscurin-deficient, stem-like
cells to attach to the endothelium of distant sites, a first step towards colonizing
metastatic tumors.

INTRODUCTION

effector proteins, control such processes as actomyosin
contractility, cellular polarity, and cell spreading [7].
While the consequences of altered Rho GTPase signaling
have been shown extensively in transformed cells cultured
on a rigid substrate [8-11], effects on suspended cells,
such as those found within the vasculature as circulating
tumor cells (CTCs), are only now being elucidated. Recent
studies have revealed that modifications which result in
increased actin filament turnover, such as activation of
the actin-severing protein cofilin, cause a weakening
of the actin cortex of suspended cells [12, 13]; this
imbalance in cytoskeletal forces permits the development
of tubulin-based projections termed “microtentacles”

Neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells is both
caused by and results in inappropriate changes to a variety
of cell signaling pathways [1-3]. In particular, deregulation
of actin and microtubule cytoskeletons results in increased
invasive potential of many tumor types, allowing
transformed cells to migrate away from the primary
tumor, survive within the vasculature, and reattach to and
extravasate through the endothelium to colonize distant
sites [4-6]. The actin cytoskeleton is regulated largely
through the dynamic activation and inactivation of Rhofamily GTPases, which, through modification of their

(McTNs) [14, 15]. McTN formation by breast epithelial
cells is associated with increased metastatic potential and
endothelial attachment [14, 16, 17], particularly following
treatment with the microtubule stabilizing drug, paclitaxel
(Taxol) [18, 19].
In light of the discovery that the human OBSCN
gene is highly mutated in a number of solid tumors [20,
21], we demonstrated that giant obscurins, once thought
to be expressed exclusively in striated muscles, are
abundantly expressed in normal breast, skin, and colon
cell lines, and breast tissue, but nearly absent from cancer
cells and tumors [22]. Abrogation of giant obscurins
from non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells
using shRNA technology (shObsc) resulted in increased
apoptotic resistance following etoposide treatment [22],
as well as increased migration, invasion, and both primary
and metastatic tumor formation in mice [23]. While these
investigations highlight a number of phenotypic changes,
including increased actin dynamics and the induction of an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), no direct link
between the loss of obscurins and cytoskeletal alterations
has been demonstrated yet. The aim of the present study is
to characterize changes to Rho GTPase signaling induced
upon loss of obscurins, as occurs during the progression
of breast cancer. We found that decreased activation of
RhoA and its effectors in obscurin-deficient MCF10A cells
causes decreased susceptibility to detachment-dependent
apoptosis and increased microtentacle (McTN) formation.
These functional differences persist following paclitaxel
treatment, after which the obscurin shRNA-treated cells
attach more efficiently than scramble control (shCtrl) cells.
This data suggests that the decrease in RhoA signaling in
obscurin-deficient cells is responsible, at least in part, for
their ability to survive more robustly at multiple steps of
the metastatic cascade [23], culminating in their enhanced
ability to colonize distant sites, even in the presence of
Taxol.

[32, 33], obscurin-B includes two active serine-threonine
kinases in its C-terminus [31, 33, 34] (Figure 1A). Recent
evidence suggests that multiple alternatively spliced
smaller isoforms exist as well [34, 35].
Recent observations from our group revealed the
presence of increased mobile actin in obscurin shRNAtreated MCF10A cells [23], which led us to hypothesize
that obscurins may play a role in the regulation of the
actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, it has been previously
shown that ectopic expression of the obscurin RhoGEF
motif in COS-7 cells or mouse tibialis anterior muscle
results in increased GTP-bound RhoA [36]. Therefore,
we hypothesized that in MCF10A breast epithelial cells,
knockdown of giant obscurins would result in decreased
RhoA activity and a concomitant reduction of RhoAdriven processes downstream of the Rho Activated Kinase
(ROCK). Indeed, in MCF10A cells that stably express
shRNA to obscurins (shObsc-1 or shObsc-2, collectively
referred to as “shObsc”; Figure 1B, densitometry in Figure
S1A), RhoA activity is reduced to levels approximately
half of control when grown in a monolayer (Figure
1C; densitometry in Figure S1B). As a consequence,
we also observe a dramatic (>50%) decrease in the
phosphorylation of ROCK targets, including myosin light
chain phosphatase (MYPT), myosin light chain (MLC),
and lim kinase (LimK), as well as the LimK target cofilin
(Figure 1D; densitometry in Figure S1C). Importantly, the
effect of obscurin knockdown on target phosphorylation is
very similar to the effect of ROCK inhibition by Y27632
(Figure 1D), consistent with it acting in the RhoA-ROCK
pathway.
The shObsc-mediated effect of reduced activating
phosphorylation of MYPT, a phosphatase for MLC, along
with decreased direct ROCK-mediated activation of
MLC, is clearly demonstrated by morphological changes
to the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas shCtrl-expressing cells
readily assemble stress fibers due to persistent RhoAdriven phosphorylation of MLC, shObsc cells have
fewer stress fibers and instead exhibit short, disorganized
actin filaments, similar to the effect of ROCK inhibition
by Y27632 (Figure 1E). The altered actin morphology
indicates that depletion of obscurins causes attenuation
of MLC-induced actomyosin contractility; this loss of
contractility and the associated loss of adhesion [37]
are likely at least partially responsible for the enhanced
migratory characteristics observed in shObsc MCF10A
cells [11, 23, 38].	
Although the effects we saw on RhoA effector
phosphorylation and stress fiber formation upon loss of
obscurins are consistent with our hypothesis that loss of
the obscurin RhoGEF motif reduces RhoA activity in
breast epithelial cells, we wanted to confirm that this is
not an indirect consequence of treatment of MCF10A
cells with shRNA. To this end, we transfected shObsc
MCF10A cells with a cDNA encoding the human obscurin
RhoGEF domain, or vector control. Because of the strong

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Obscurins, originally characterized in skeletal
and cardiac muscle, play key roles in the development
of the sarcomere and its contractile function [24-32].
They are encoded by the single OBSCN gene, located on
human chromosome 1q42, and produced via alternative
splicing [31, 33]. The largest isoforms, obscurin-A
(720 kDa) and obscurin-B (870 kDa), are comprised of
immunoglobulin and fibronectin-III repeats followed by
several signaling and scaffolding domains, including an
isoleucine-glutamine calmodulin binding domain, a srchomology-3 (SH3) domain, and tandem Rho guanine
exchange factor (RhoGEF) – pleckstrin homology
(PH) motifs. The giant isoforms differ only in their
extreme C-termini; while obscurin-A has a non-modular
C-terminus that includes binding sites for ankyrins as
well as predicted phosphorylation sites for ERK kinases

dominant negative effect previously observed following
overexpression of the RhoGEF domain in cells with
intact endogenous large obscurins [36], we elected to not
perform the experiments in shCtrl MCF10A cells, which
still express high levels of the large isoforms (Figure 1B).
Transient transfection with the obscurin RhoGEF domain
rescues the shObsc-induced decrease in RhoA activity
(Figure 2A), demonstrating that the changes to RhoA
signaling observed in breast epithelial cells upon obscurin
downregulation are specifically due to the loss of the
RhoGEF activity. Furthermore, we extended our findings
from our previous work [23], which showed increased
migration and invasion upon loss of giant obscurins, by
demonstrating that ectopic expression of the obscurin
RhoGEF in obscurin knockdown MCF10A cells reduces
both monolayer migration (Figure 2B) and invasion

through matrigel (Figure 2C). Treatment with the ROCK
inhibitor Y27632 reversed the suppressive effects of the
RhoGEF domain for both monolayer migration (Figure
2B) and invasion (Figure 2C), as shown by the absence of
statistically significant differences between vector controland RhoGEF-expressing obscurin knockdown cells
following Y27632 treatment, indicating that the obscurin
RhoGEF acts upstream of ROCK by modifying RhoA
activity. Interestingly though, Y27632 treatment modestly
increased migration and substantially increased invasion of
the obscurin knockdown MCF10A cells. This is consistent
with previous findings obtained from a variety of cell
types for both migration [39, 40] and invasion [41, 42],
and likely reflects the fact that complete ROCK inhibition
blocks signal inputs from several cellular pathways, while
knocking down obscurins has a more modest effect due

to its specificity, affecting only RhoA signaling to ROCK.
The observation of reduced phosphorylation (i.e.,
increased activity) of cofilin suggests that in addition
to the reduced actomyosin contractility, obscurin
knockdown enhances actin-severing activity and turnover
of actin filaments, consistent with increased mobile
actin detected in shObsc-expressing MCF10A cells
[23]. Previous measurements in PTEN-/- MCF10A cells
have demonstrated that higher cofilin activity results in
decreased cortical actin tension [12]. This decrease in
tension is no longer sufficient to counteract the extension
of microtubules, which in suspended epithelial cells
(such as those that are found within the vasculature as
circulating tumor cells, CTCs) allows the formation of
microtentacles, McTNs [14, 15], tubulin-based projections
that allow reattachment to the endothelium. We therefore
focused the remainder of our studies on suspended cells
and how the depletion of obscurins may govern processes
related to metastasis.
Since MCF10A cells expressing shObsc are

capable of resisting apoptosis induced by DNA damage
[22], we wanted first to see if the apoptotic resistance
extended to substrate detachment as well. Epithelial cells
rely on survival signals from engaged integrins; in the
signals’ absence, epithelial cells undergo anoikis [43-45].
Following plating in conditions that prohibit attachment,
shCtrl-expressing cells readily undergo programmed cell
death, as indicated by cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate,
poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) (Figure 3A). In
contrast, though, shObsc MCF10A cells cleave less PARP
after 24 hours, an effect that is abrogated by the addition
of the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, which acts downstream
of the obscurin RhoGEF’s activation of RhoA (Figure
S2A). This finding suggests that upon loss of obscurins
expression, epithelial cells lose the ability to self-destruct
when detached from the extracellular matrix (ECM); this
represents an important positive selection step for survival
as a CTC and eventual metastatic colonization. The RhoA
pathway has previously been implicated in the regulation
of apoptosis through actomyosin contractility. MDA-

MB-231 breast cancer cells can be re-sensitized to anoikis
by overexpression of tropomyosin-1, which activates
ROCK-mediated processes such as stress fiber formation
[46], and is consistent with several studies demonstrating
that ROCK inhibition results in increased survival [4751]. Furthermore, activation of RhoA by the RhoGEF
Abr plays a role in initiating actomyosin contractility and
dissociation-induced apoptosis in human embryonic stem
cells [52]. Therefore, loss of obscurin RhoGEF-driven
RhoA activation is likely responsible for the resistance
to detachment-induced apoptosis in shObsc MCF10A
cells. Indeed, reduction of RhoA activity (Figure 3B;
densitometry in Figure S2B) and effector phosphorylation
(Figure 3C; densitometry in Figure S2C) persist even in
suspended conditions in obscurin shRNA-expressing
MCF10A cells relative to shCtrl.
Having ascertained that obscurin knockdown
cells have acquired the capacity to survive in detached
conditions, we then examined their ability to form McTNs.
McTN formation is enhanced when actin is rapidly turning
over [12], as is the case in shObsc cells in suspension,
as indicated by the decreased cofilin phosphorylation
relative to shCtrl cells (Figure 3C). Furthermore, modest
concomitant upregulation of detyrosinated α-tubulin (glutubulin) and of the intermediate filament vimentin (Figure
4A, densitometry in Figure S3), both of which serve to
stabilize microtubules, provides shObsc-expressing cells
an additional mechanism to enhance the establishment of
McTNs [14, 15]. As a result, while only 10% of shCtrl
cells extend robust McTNs in suspension, approximately
40% of shObsc-expressing cells that form McTNs (Figure
4B). This phenomenon is clearly seen in Figure 4C,
which depicts representative cells in suspension following
staining with the plasma membrane marker CellMask

Orange. While shCtrl cells are compact and do not
readily form projections, shObsc-expressing cells extend
multiple McTNs per cell (arrows). Importantly, McTN
formation is disrupted by transient transfection of the
obscurin RhoGEF but not vector control, demonstrating
that loss of obscurin and the associated downregulation of
RhoA-driven processes is sufficient for the extension of
microtentacles in MCF10A cells (Figure 4D).
In breast cancer cell lines, the percentage of cells
exhibiting McTNs correlates with their in vitro metastatic
potential [14]. Furthermore, the ability of injected breast
tumor cells to reattach in the lungs of mice is associated
with the percentage of cells that form McTNs [16]. We
thus evaluated the functionality of the McTNs produced by
the shObsc-expressing MCF10A cells using an impedance
assay of cell reattachment. As shown in Figure 4E, McTNproducing shObsc cells attach approximately 1.25-1.5
fold better than shCtrl cells between one and two hours.
However, in the presence of colchicine (a microtubule
polymerization inhibitor), attachment is entirely abolished,
consistent with a microtubule-driven attachment process
(data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that in the
absence of giant obscurins, altered actin dynamics allowed
the formation of microtentacles, which substantially
enhances the ability of obscurin knockdown cells to attach.
We have previously observed increased metastasis of
shObsc cells relative to shCtrl cells in both subcutaneous
and tail-vein mouse tumor models [23]. It is likely that
the increased attachment to an xCelligence plate is
recapitulated in vivo and is partially responsible for the
increased metastatic colonization by shObsc cells. Shortterm capillary retention experiments [16] could address
this question by evaluating the in vivo attachment of shCtrl
and shObsc cells. Furthermore, testing the ability of the

RhoGEF domain to affect reattachment of shObsc cells
in vitro and in vivo will demonstrate its role in abrogating
reattachment, and thus metastasis.
Given the effect of obscurin knockdown on
the formation of microtubule-based projections, we
hypothesized that treatment with paclitaxel, which binds
to β-tubulin and inhibits disassembly of microtubules,
would differentially affect shCtrl- and shObsc-expressing
cells. We first treated adherent, proliferating cells with
physiologically relevant concentrations of paclitaxel,
ranging from 100-1000 nM, and noted a small, but
reproducible, difference in viability following a 48-hour
exposure (Figure 5A). Importantly, during treatment
with 0.5 μg/mL (439 nM) paclitaxel, shObsc cells still
exhibited increased capacity to attach to a substrate,
albeit at levels lower than untreated cells (Figure 5B). It

is known that paclitaxel can cause more than a 1,000-fold
increase in the number of CTCs shed from the primary
tumor [53]. Given that cells that do not express giant
obscurins are relatively resistant to detachment-induced
apoptosis, they will survive in the anchorage independent
environment of the vasculature. Therefore, not only do
low obscurin-expressing or obscurin-depleted tumor cells
have a survival advantage, they also have an enhanced
ability to form McTNs and attach to distant sites even
in the presence of paclitaxel. Thus, tumor cells with low
or depleted obscurin expression possess advantages at
multiple steps in the metastatic cascade, which could each
contribute to their increased metastatic capacity [23].

CONCLUSIONS
The process of metastasis involves many discrete
steps at which selective pressure is applied to those cells
that escape the primary tumor. A metastatic tumor contains
cells that have proliferated at the primary site, invaded
away from the primary tumor and intravasated, survived
their journey through the vasculature, reattached to distant
endothelial cells and extravasated, then commenced
proliferating again [54]. Gene expression differences
that result in a small positive selection bias at each step

will ultimately cause the enrichment of highly resistant
cells. In this study along with our previous work, we have
shown that loss of expression of obscurins, as is observed
in breast cancers [23, 55], is sufficient to establish this
selection bias: Cells deficient in obscurins 1) display
enhanced stem-like characteristics and proliferate to
form tumorspheres [23], 2) migrate and invade through
the extracellular matrix [23], 3) survive in anchorageindependent conditions [22], 4) reattach to a substrate (this
study), and 5) grow into metastatic tumors [23]. In part,
these differences are due to the reduced phosphorylation
of the RhoA effectors LimK, cofilin, MYPT, and
MLC, causing the increased migration, invasion, and
reattachment of obscurin-deficient cells (Figure 6).
Importantly, treatment with paclitaxel gives shObsc cells
a further survival advantage; these surviving paclitaxeltreated shObsc cells may then reattach more readily than
paclitaxel-treated control cells. Therefore, paclitaxel
treatment of breast cancer patients could preferentially
select for the obscurin-deficient, attachment-competent
circulating tumor cells while having an overall cytotoxic
effect. Although detailed studies of the effect of paclitaxel
on breast cancer cells which have lost expression of
obscurins are necessary to truly evaluate risk, it is clear
that loss of obscurins constitutes a substantial risk factor
for metastatic tumor formation.

Tissue Culture
MCF10A cells stably expressing shCtrl or shObsc-1
or -2 (targeting Ig domains 24 and 9, respectively) were
prepared and maintained as previously described [22, 23].
Cells were kept at low passage, never allowed to become
confluent, and regularly checked by western blot for
knockdown of obscurins.

Western Blotting
For attached cell blotting, MCF10A cells expressing
shCtrl or shObsc were grown to 50% confluence, and
fresh complete media was added for 24 hours before
lysates were collected in Radio-Immuno-Precipitation
Assay (RIPA) or Lammelli buffer. Equal amounts of
lysates were electrophoresed and blotted as previously
described [12, 22]. For suspended cell blotting, shCtrl or
shObsc MCF10A cells were trypsinized and suspended
in low-attachment conditions in complete media for 1
hour, before collection for lysate preparation. For ROCK
inhibition, 10 µM Y27632 (Sigma) was added to the cells
in fresh complete media for 1 hour prior to collection.
Antibodies used included obscurin-COOH [56], α-tubulin

Figure 6: Loss of obscurins alters RhoA-driven signaling and cytoskeletal processes in breast epithelial cells. A) In

normal cells, the obscurin RhoGEF domain activates RhoA signaling, which then activates ROCK to phosphorylate its downstream
effectors. This includes phosphorylation of LimK, which in turn phosphorylates and downregulates the activity of cofilin, resulting in
relatively low basal actin turnover. Furthermore, MLC activity (and therefore actomyosin contractility) is relatively high owing to both
direct ROCK phosphorylation of MLC as well as inactivating phosphorylation of MYPT, which then dephosphorylates and inactivates
MLC. B) In cancer cells that have lost expression of giant obscurins, there is less GTP-bound RhoA (red arrow) owing to less activation
by the absent obscurin RhoGEF domain (red X). This causes decreased ROCK activity (red arrow) and less LimK phosphorylation (red
arrow); reduced phosphorylation of cofilin by LimK causes an increase in its actin-severing activity (green arrow) and greater actin filament
turnover. Reduced MLC activity (red arrow) and thus actomyosin contractility is due to both decreased ROCK phosphorylation as well as
increased phosphatase activity by MYPT (green arrow).

MCF10 cells expressing shCtrl or shObsc-1 or

per the manufacturer’s protocols (Cytoskeleton, Inc).
Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software.

shObsc-1 and shObsc-2 MCF10A cells transfected
with empty vector or the obscurin RhoGEF domain were
detached 24 hours post-transfection, spun down, and
resuspended in DMEM, then added to the interior of 24well format Transwell chambers (Corning) at 150,000
cells per chamber. Complete MCF10A media was added
to the exterior of the chamber and cells allowed to invade
towards the chemoattractant. For cells treated with ROCK
inhibitor, 10 µM Y27632 was included in both the inner
and outer chambers. After 16 hours, the membrane surface
was scrubbed to remove non-invading cells, and fixed with
0.5% crystal violet in 50% methanol. Invading cells were
photographed and blindly counted per membrane.

Confocal Microscopy

PARP Cleavage

Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde as previously described [22]. For
ROCK inhibition, cells were treated with 10 µM Y27632
in complete media for 1 hour prior to fixation. Cells were
stained with phalloidin-568 (Molecular Probes), and
representative regions were imaged on a Zeiss LSM510
confocal microscope under 60X magnification.

shCtrl-, shObsc-1-, and shObsc-2-expressing
MCF10A cells were plated in low-attach conditions in
serum- and growth factor-free media and collected in
RIPA buffer after 24 hours. Equal amounts of lysates were
blotted as previously described [12], and probed for total
PARP (CST), which detects both intact (112 kDa) and
cleaved (85 kDa) forms. For ROCK inhibition, Y27632
was added to the serum- and growth factor-free media at
10 μM for 24 hours prior to collection.

Transfections

Microtentacle Formation

MCF10A cells expressing shObsc were seeded at
40% confluence and 24 hours later transfected with empty
pmCherry-C1 vector (Clontech) or with pmCherry-C1
vector containing the human obscurin RhoGEF domain
(amino acids 5697-5873, inclusive, of NCBI NP_443075).
The TransIT-2020 reagent (Mirus) was used to achieve
approximately 80% transfection efficiency, and cells used
for blotting, RhoGTPase pulldowns, or McTN formation
24 hours post-transfection.

MCF10A cells expressing shCtrl or shObsc-1
or -2 were transfected with Cell Mask Orange (Life
Technologies) as a contrast agent and detached after 30
minutes, as previously described [14, 15]. 25,000 cells
were added to 24-well low-attach plates in DMEM/F12
with 1% charcoal dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum
(HyClone). After 30 minutes in suspension, 100 cells
(approximately 10 fields of view at 60x) from 2 replicate
wells were blindly scored on a fluorescent microscope
for the presence of microtentacles. Experiments were
completed 3 times. Images were color inverted in ImageJ
for ease of viewing.

Scratch Assay
shObsc-1 and -2 MCF10A cells transfected with
empty vector or the obscurin RhoGEF domain were
detached 24 hours post-transfection and plated overnight
at 800,000 cells per well of a 12-well dish to achieve
100% confluence. A 200 μL pipet tip was used to introduce
a scratch in the monolayer, and fresh complete media with
or without 10 µM Y27632 was added to remove debris.
Images were collected at 0 and 6 hours, and measurement
of wound width was performed using ImageJ software,
blindly.

Impedance Assay
The xCelligence system (Roche) was used to
measure electrical impedance during attachment. MCF10A
cells were grown to 50% confluence, detached, and 10,000
cells/well were allowed to attach to the xCelligence
plate for two hours in complete media. Impedance (∆C)
is expressed in arbitrary units. For experiments in the
presence of paclitaxel, cells were pre-treated with 0.5
µg/mL paclitaxel or vehicle control for 1 hour, then
trypsinized and allowed to attach for an additional 2

Experiments were repeated at least three times, and error
bars represent the standard deviations of three replicate
wells per experiment.

shCtrl, shObsc-1 and shObsc-2 cells were plated
in 96-well dishes and grown to 50% confluence, then
treated with 0.1 – 1.0 µM paclitaxel or vehicle for 48
hours in complete media. An XTT assay was performed
as previously described [22] to measure viability relative
to vehicle control. Values were normalized to control
shRNA.
