BACKGROUND: The optimal postremission therapy in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is still a matter of
debate. The objective of this study was to compare the various potential therapeutic options for patients who achieved
first complete remission. METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, including patients with standard-risk (SR) All and high-risk (HR) ALL who received first postremission therapy.
Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality (ACM), disease recurrence (relapse), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM).
Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and pooled. RESULTS: Overall, there was a
significant reduction in ACM in the allogenic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) arm (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.8-0.97)
compared with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses revealed a similar
pattern among SR patients (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.68-0.94) but a nonsignificant advantage for alloSCT among HR
patients (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.01). There was an increase in NRM (RR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.37-6.53) and a decrease in
the relapse rate in the alloSCT arm (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.83). There was no difference in ACM or the relapse rate
between the ASCT and chemotherapy arms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, alloSCT was superior to ASCT or chemotherapy
for patients with ALL in first complete remission. The survival advantage was of greater statistical significance for

KEYWORDS: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, allogeneic transplantation, autologous stem cell transplantation,
chemotherapy, first complete remission.

The treatment of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) usually consists of a remission induction
phase and consolidation/intensification phases followed by either hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or
maintenance therapy. Currently, it is uncertain whether patients who achieve a first complete remission (CR1) should either receive intensive treatment with HSCT or continue with conventional chemotherapy.1-3 By combining clinical,
immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular data, patients can be classified into standard-risk (SR) and high-risk
(HR) groups according to their prognostic scores.1,4
An American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation position statement and an evidence-based review suggested that HSCT yields outcomes similar to chemotherapy and is not recommended as first-choice therapy in CR1.5
Two previous meta-analyses indicated that the survival of patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT (alloSCT) was superior to the survival of patients who received chemotherapy, mainly in the HR group of patients.6,7 Recently, 2 large prospective trials demonstrated superior survival for alloSCT in SR patients and a nonsignificant advantage in HR
patients.8-10 Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis based on randomized and genetically
randomized trials to assess which is the optimal postremission treatment for ALL patients in CR1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
We conducted a comprehensive search strategy with no
restriction on language or study years to identify both
published and unpublished trials. Relevant trials were
identified by searching the Cochrane Library, PubMed,
LILACS, and CANCERLIT up to March 2009. We
searched the following conference proceedings for relevant abstracts: the American Society of Hematology
(from 2004), the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(from 2000), the European Hematology Association
(from 2001), the American Society of Bone Marrow
Transplantation (from 2007), the European Group for
Blood and Marrow Transplantation (from 2005), and
conferences of Experimental Hematology (available at:
http://www.iseh.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm accessed March
1, 2009). The following trial databases were searched for
ongoing and unpublished trials: current controlled trials
in the MetaRegister of controlled clinical trials (available
at: http://www.controlled-trials.com/ accessed March 1,
2009) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (available at: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ accessed
March 1, 2009). The references from all identified studies
were investigated to identify more trials. In addition, the
first or corresponding author of each included trial was
contacted for information regarding unpublished trials or
complementary information on their own trial. The following search terms were used for Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) headings (mh) to identify publication type
(pt): transplant AND (acute lymphoblastic leukemia OR
acute lymphoblastic leukemia OR acute lymphoblastic
leukemia [MeSH]) AND (prospective OR longitudinal
OR cohort OR randomized controlled trial [pt] OR controlled clinical trial [pt] OR randomized controlled trials
[mh] OR random allocation [mh] NOT [animals (mh)
NOT human (mh)]).

Study Selection
We included trials that assessed adult patients aged >15
years with ALL in CR1, because this was the age chosen
by the majority of the studies as inclusion criteria. We
included randomized controlled trials and genetically
randomized studies, which we defined by patient allocation to intervention on the basis of sibling donor availability.11 Trials were included only once in the analysis using
the most updated data. Interventions that were assessed
included alloSCT, autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT), or conventional chemotherapy.

Data Extraction
Two reviewers independently extracted data from
included trials (R.R. and A.G.-G.). In case of any disagreement between the 2 reviewers, a third reviewer
extracted the data (L.V.). When necessary, the authors of
the trials were contacted for clarification and complementary information on their trials.
Risk of Bias Assessment
Although genetically randomized trials serve as an alternative platform for randomized controlled trials, they do
carry a higher risk for bias. Because the different trial arms
are not truly randomized, various characteristics may not
be well balanced and carry a potential for bias. Thus, trials
that fulfilled the review inclusion criteria were assessed for
methodological quality by 2 reviewers (R.R. and A.G.G.). Not reporting of any of the items was considered as
high risk for bias. For ‘‘standard’’ randomized trials, we
assessed the methods used for sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, and exclusions from
analysis by using standard methods as recommended in
the Cochrane Handbook.12
For genetically randomized controlled trials, we
based our assessment on previous recommendations.11
First, we evaluated whether the trial was analyzed with
intention-to-treat (ITT) methodology. ITT was defined
as the number of randomized patients that were excluded
from their allocated intervention group for outcome
assessment and the number of the nonrandomized
patients included (no sibling or unrelated alloSCT). This
was done because an ‘‘as treated’’ analysis might introduce
bias in favor of alloSCT in the process of patient selection.
We considered any violation of ITT as the sole most important risk of bias domain for genetically randomized
trials.
The second step was to assess the following
domains11:

1) Timing of study entry for patients in the
alloHSCT versus conventional chemotherapy or
ASCT groups and comparative duration of follow-up: Earlier recruitment of patients into the
‘‘no donor’’ group might introduce bias in favor
of alloSCT, because this enables more time for
outcomes to occur in the ‘‘no donor’’ group.
2) Method of tissue typing: Because genetic randomization depends on the assessment of sibling
matching, adequate human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) typing and reporting must be ensured.

3) Compliance with the assigned intervention: Poor
compliance (eg, no alloSCT for patients with
available sibling donors and unrelated alloSCT
for patients without sibling donors) probably
would not introduce systematic bias,11 but it
might introduce a mild dilution of any treatment
effect (benefit or harm of HSCT or
chemotherapy).
4) Comparability of potential confounders: The comparability of the study groups was assessed based
on the following confounders: age, patient’s risk
group (SR/HR according to study definitions),
and performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] or as defined in study).
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality
(ACM) at the longest available follow-up if <5 years. We
chose this length of time because it is long enough to
reflect both regimen-related toxicities and recurrencerelated mortality.5 Secondary outcomes included nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse rate.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Dichotomous data were analyzed by calculating the relative risk (RR) for each trial with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects
model to pool RRs throughout the review because of
expected heterogeneity between studies related to different distribution of disease risk characteristics. The ran-

dom effects model is based on the assumption that
different studies are not identical but follow some (usually
normal) distribution. The pooled estimate refers to the
center of intervention effects. The confidence intervals
describe the uncertainty in the location of this mean.12
We used the original definitions of the trials for the
SR and HR groups (Table 1). In addition, we performed
subgroup analyses to assess the impact of ITT methodology on the main results.
The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT)
was calculated as the inverse of pooled risk differences.
Differences in confounders were assessed using the Student t test or as reported in the primary publication. For
the randomized controlled trials, we graded allocation
concealment and generation as adequate, unclear, or
inadequate.12
Analyses were conducted using the Review Manager,
version 5.0 (RevMan 5) computer program (2008; Nordic Cochrane Center/Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Formulae for all meta-analysis methods
are provided in the statistical algorithms of RevMan 5
(available at http://www.cc-ims.net/revman/ accessed
March 1, 2009 and at http://www.cochrane-handbook.
org accessed March 1, 2009).

RESULTS
The search yielded 659 potentially relevant trials, and 80
of those trials were considered for further investigation;
however, 67 of the 80 studies were excluded for various
reasons (Fig. 1). Thirteen trials (17 comparisons)

of those trials included an ITT desisgn.9,10,13-15,17,18,21,22
Reasons for the inability to perform ITT analysis included
the inclusion of patients who underwent matched unrelated donor transplantation in the nondonor study arm8
and the inclusion of patients with no siblings in the nondonor arm.19 In 1 study that had 2 arms, only 1 arm fulfilled the ITT definitions (ALL patients with central
nervous system involvement).18 The other arm (patients
with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL) was considered non-ITT because it included patients who had
matched unrelated donors and lacked sufficient clarity
regarding the randomized numbers.
Most of the studies did not report data on potential
cofounders (Table 3). The rate of compliance with the
assigned intervention ranged between 56% and 95%. Trials that compared ASCT with chemotherapy used standard randomization; 2 of the 6 trials reported adequate
randomization generation and allocation concealment.
None of the trials were blinded (Table 3).

conducted between 1986 and 2006 that randomized 2648
patients fulfilled inclusion criteria.8-10,13-22 Two trials15,22
did not report on mortality and were included only in the secondary outcome analysis. One trial compared ASCT with
chemotherapy only.16 Twelve trials compared alloSCT with
other treatment modalities (10 trials compared alloSCT with
ASCT or chemotherapy,9,10,13-15,17,19-22 and 2 trials compared alloSCT with ASCT only8,18). Five trials (6 publications) compared ASCT with chemotherapy9,13,16,18,19,21
(Table 2). It is noteworthy that 3 trials were updates of previously published studies and were included only once in the
current analysis.9,18,19
Induction therapy for ALL included various regimens. The definition of HR patients was not consistent
between trials (Table 1). All trials used myeloablative conditioning based on a total body irradiation (TBI)/cyclophosphamide regimen. The mean duration of follow-up
among all studies was 62 months (range, 30-110 months).
Data regarding demographics, host and donor characteristics, transplantation protocol, and post-transplantation
data are summarized in Table 2.

AlloSCT Versus Other Treatment Options
Primary outcome: ACM

There was a significant reduction in ACM in the
alloSCT arm compared with the chemotherapy or ASCT
arm (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.8-0.97; 10 trials, 2600
patients) (Fig. 2, Top). We analyzed separately the trials
that used or did not use an ITT design. When only trials
that reported outcomes based on ITT analysis were
included, there was a significant reduction in ACM with
alloSCT (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97; 7 trials, 1863
patients) (Fig. 2, Top). Trials that did not report ITT
analysis had a lower effect estimate without statistical significance (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.64-1.02; 4 trials). Heterogeneity was demonstrated only in the non-ITT analyses.
The NNT to prevent 1 death with alloSCT for the ITT
trials was 17 (95% CI, 9-50), and the unadjusted mortality rate was 57% in the control group. An analysis that
was conducted after exclusion of the Medical Research
Council (MRC)/ECOG trial (which contributed 38% of
the patients) yielded an RR similar to that obtained for
the overall mortality, although the difference was not statistically significant (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.02; percentage of variability caused by heterogeneity [I2], 40%; 9
trials).
Two trials, neither of which used ITT methodology,
compared alloSCT with ASCT and did not report a statistically significant difference between the 2 arms (RR,
0.66; 95% CI, 0.34-1.26; I2, 76%; 2 trials).8,20 Only 1
trial that used ITT methodology compared alloSCT with

chemotherapy and did not report a statistically significant
difference between the 2 arms (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.711.47; 1 trial).17
ACM for SR patients

Three trials that randomized 861 patients reported
on ACM for SR patients.8,9,14 There was a significant
reduction in ACM in the alloSCT arm (RR, 0.80; 95%
CI, 0.68-0.94; 3 trials) (Fig. 2, Bottom). Sensitivity analysis for the ITT trials only produced similar results, ie, a
significant reduction in ACM in the alloSCT arm (RR,
0.82; 95% CI, 0.7-0.98; 2 trials). No heterogeneity was
demonstrated. The NNT for the ITT trials was 11 (95%
CI, 6-100), and the control event rate was 49%.
ACM for HR patients

Seven trials that randomized 1364 patients reported
on ACM for HR patients.8-10,14,18,20,21 Although the RR
was similar to that obtained for overall mortality, it was
not statistically significant (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.01;
I2, 55%; 7 trials) (Fig. 2, Bottom). Sensitivity analysis
indicated a higher RR for the ITT studies (RR, 0.91; 95%
CI, 0.8-1.04; I2, 32%; 5 trials) than the non-ITT studies
(RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.49-1.01; I2, 75%; 3 trials) with
overlapping 95% CIs. An analysis that was conducted after exclusion of the MRC/ECOG trial (which contributed
38% of the patients) yielded an RR similar to that
obtained for overall mortality in HR patients (RR, 0.87;
95% CI, 0.68-1.11; I2, 67%; 6 trials).
Secondary outcomes

There was a significant increase in NRM in the
alloSCT arm (RR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.37-6.53; I2, 74%; 5
trials, 1746 patients). Sensitivity analysis of the ITT trials
indicated a similar increase without statistical significance
(RR, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.69-6.2; I2, 82%; 3 trials).
There was a significant reduction in the recurrence
rate in the alloSCT arm (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.83;

3454

I2, 86%; 6 trials, 1156 patients). A sensitivity analysis of
the ITT studies produced similar results without statistical
significance (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.25-1.33; I2, 92%; 3 trials). Both secondary outcomes demonstrated significant
heterogeneity, possibly because some trials included only
HR patients,20,21 whereas others included both HR and
SR patients.8,9,15
ASCT Versus Chemotherapy
Five conventionally randomized trials (6 publications)
that enrolled 963 patients compared ASCT with chemotherapy.9,13,16,18,19,21 The results of 1 of those studies16
also were reported in another article.19
There was no difference in ACM between the ASCT
and chemotherapy arms (RR, 1.02; 95%CI, 0.88-1.19;
I2, 46%; 5 trials, 903 patients) (Fig. 3). Similarly, there
was no difference in ACM in a subgroup analysis of the
SR group (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.72-1.47; I2, 64%; 2 trials) and the HR group (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91-1.17; 4
trials).
There was a significant increase in NRM in the
ASCT arm compared with the chemotherapy arm (RR,
1.77; 95% CI, 1.12-2.8; 2 trials). There was no difference
in the recurrence rate between the 2 arms (RR, 0.92; 95%
CI, 0.73-1.15; I2, 74%; 3 trials).

DISCUSSION
It is well accepted that postremission recurrence is the
main cause of death in adult patients with ALL. Therefore, patients should receive further treatment with
alloSCT, ASCT, or conventional chemotherapy. The
objective of our current systematic review was to identify
the optimal postremission therapy for adult patients with
ALL in first CR. We included 13 randomized or genetically randomized trials that enrolled 2648 patients and
compared alloSCT, ASCT, and conventional
chemotherapy.

Treating ALL in CR1—Meta-Analysis/Ram et al

We observed a significant reduction in ACM in the
alloSCT arm versus the ASCT or conventional chemotherapy arm for all patients (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.8-0.97)
that also was confirmed for SR patients as a group (RR,
0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.94; 861 patients). Although more
patients were included in the HR group, the difference
was not statistically significant for these patients (RR,
0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.01; 1364 patients). When only genetically randomized trials with ITT analysis were
included, the results were similar between the SR group,
the HR group, and all patients.
The interpretation of these results is that, overall, for
ALL patients who achieved first CR, alloSCT had a survival benefit compared with the other options. The survival advantage for alloSCT had greater magnitude and
statistical significance only for the SR patients. In this
group, the validity of results was strengthened by the low
heterogeneity and the narrow CI, although the results
were derived from only 2 ITT trials and 1 non-ITT trial.
The NNT to prevent 1 death with alloSCT for the SR
group was 11 (95% CI, 6-100). This number, which
reflects mortality risk reduction, supports the notion that
alloSCT is superior to other treatments for patients with
SR ALL. Conversely, the greater heterogeneity and the
finding that the results were not significant make it hard
to determine which treatment is best for patients with HR
ALL.
Our results are in accordance with the findings of
the recently published MRC/ECOG trial, which demonstrated that SR patients are the main group of ALL
patients that may benefit from alloSCT.9 When we
excluded the results of that study from our meta-analysis
(for all patients and for the HR group), the results
remained similar, although they were not statistically significant. Contrary to a previous meta-analyses and to the
common notion, we could not demonstrated that HR
patients would benefit from alloSCT.6,7 This difference
may stem from 2 main causes: The first is the inclusion of
2 recent large trials, especially the MRC/ECOG trial,8-10
which is considered the largest randomized trial to date
and demonstrated a significant improvement in overall
survival with alloSCT mainly for patients with SR ALL.9
The second explanation stems from the methodology of
our meta-analysis, in which we used different inclusion
criteria for various studies in the meta-analysis, ie, we
included only genetically randomized studies and put emphasis on studies that used an ITT methodology.
Our second comparison between ASCT and chemotherapy (5 trials, 963 patients) yielded similar ACM and

recurrence rate results for both arms. There was no superiority for either arm in subgroup analysis according to risk
group. However, there was a significant increase in NRM
in the ASCT arm (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12-2.8). Physicians who care for these patients should take these data
into consideration when recommending treatment for
patients who are not eligible for alloSCT. Although it is
only speculative, it is possible that certain patient groups
(such as younger patients and those without significant
comorbidities) may have lower NRM compared with conventional chemotherapy and, thus, may benefit from
ASCT. Recently, phase 2 trials demonstrated that a pediatric-inspired intensive chemotherapy approach markedly
improved the outcome of adult and adolescence patients
with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL.23 Therefore, the issue of whether ASCT and chemotherapy are
equivalent still should be addressed in future studies.
There are several limitations to this systematic
review. First, we could not conduct subgroup analyses
according to specific HR features. Specifically, we could
not conduct a subgroup analysis based on the age of
patients because of the sparse data in many of the trials.
Furthermore, there are several groups of patients for
whom our conclusions may not be applicable. The first
group includes patients with Philadelphia chromosomepositive ALL, because the role of incorporating tyrosine
kinase inhibitors into treatment protocols has not yet
been elucidated. The other group includes patients who
undergo transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. These procedures have become more
popular in recent years, and their NRM and recurrence
rates differ from those reported in the studies that we
included in our current meta-analysis.
Another main limitation of our meta-analysis is the
paucity of prospective randomized controlled trials. ALL
is relatively uncommon in adults, and there is no optimal
way to perform a randomized controlled trial. Although
genetic randomization is a well accepted alternative,11 it
needs to be conducted appropriately according to strict
methodological rules with adequate reporting. In our
review, some trials did not report on ITT, and some did
not evaluate the possible confounders between the 2 arms
Furthermore, some of our analyses indicated statistical
heterogeneity. This may be explained by different populations of patients, different percentages of patients that
actually received the allocated treatment, and variable definitions of the risk groups. However, for the results that
were statistically significant, most studies demonstrated a
certain degree of benefit for the intervention rather than

divergent results. The diverse definitions of HR disease
might have contributed to the significant heterogeneity in
the subgroup analysis of the HR patient subgroup.

Implications for Practice and for Research
Our systematic review indicates an overall benefit from
alloSCT for patients with ALL in first CR. The survival
advantage is of greater magnitude and statistical significance for SR patients. For HR patients, ITT-based genetically randomized trials that will assess different HR
features are needed to evaluate the best postremission
treatment. The role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, reduced
intensity conditioning, and alternative donor alloSCT
should be assessed in future trials.
Future trials should aim at reporting on ACM and
should try to apply uniform risk criteria when reporting
on outcomes of different subgroups. Attempts to minimize the risk of bias in these trials are crucial.
