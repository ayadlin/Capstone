BACKGROUND: A common polymorphism, rs4644, coding for Pro64 or His64 of the carbohydrate-binding protein
galectin-3, influences the susceptibility of galectin-3 to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases and is associated with
breast cancer incidence. Because forced expression of galectin-3 in a galectin-3 null breast cancer cell line confers
sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), the authors sought to determine
whether the His64/Pro64 polymorphism of galectin-3 affects the sensitivity to TRAIL. METHODS: Genomic DNA of
breast cell lines was analyzed for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs4644, and cytotoxicity was determined with
the MTT assay. RESULTS: When a collection of 9 breast cancer cell lines that express galectin-3 was examined for lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 3 (LGALS3) genotype and sensitivity to doxorubicin and TRAIL, doxorubicin sensitivity was not found to be related to LGALS3 genotype. In contrast, none of the 5 cell lines that were homozygous for
Pro64 galectin-3 were found to be sensitive to TRAIL, but 2 of 2 homozygous His64 cell lines and 1 of 2 heterozygous
His64 cell lines were sensitive to TRAIL. Forced expression of galectin-3 of defined genotype in galectin-3 null cells
was used to more directly test the effect of the Pro64His mutation on TRAIL sensitivity. High levels of expression of
His64 galectin-3 rendered BT549 cells sensitive to TRAIL and resistant to doxorubicin, but cells expressing Pro64
galectin-3 remained resistant to TRAIL and sensitive to doxorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study
indicate that the naturally occurring Pro64His mutation in galectin-3 increases sensitivity to death receptor-mediated
apoptosis. This finding could be relevant to disparities in breast cancer outcomes across population groups, and

Galectin -3 is an endogenous carbohydrate-binding protein that has been shown to have functions in several cellular
processes.1,2 Galectin-3 can either increase or decrease apoptosis, depending on cell type and stimulus. Overexpression of
galectin-3 in breast carcinoma cells renders them resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs,3,4 but inactivates Akt and sensitizes
them to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis.5,6 The gene for galectin-3,
lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 3 (LGALS3), is polymorphic in human populations. It has been reported that a common galectin-3 polymorphism, rs4644, influences the susceptibility of galectin-3 to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs).7 The protein with His64 is cleaved by MMP-2 and MMP-9, but the form of the protein with Pro64 is resistant
to cleavage. The rs4644 polymorphism (Pro64His mutation) is also related to breast cancer development. Genotype analyses have indicated that the His64 genotype is associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer.8
TRAIL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, transmits death signals through death domain-containing
receptors.9,10 In addition to its direct apoptosis-inducing effect,5 TRAIL also plays an important role in immune surveillance against tumor initiation, development, and metastasis, suggesting a potential application to cancer therapy.11,12
Because TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis in a variety of transformed cells, but not in most normal cells, this pathway is
being investigated as a target for therapies, including phase 1 clinical trials of recombinant soluble TRAIL, anti-DR4 antibody, and anti-DR5 antibody. However, resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells may limit the success of

TRAIL therapy. Earlier results from our institution demonstrated that forced expression of galectin-3 in a galectin-3 null breast cancer cell line conferred sensitivity to
TRAIL via a novel mechanism that involves up-regulation
of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).5 The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the
His64/Pro 64 polymorphism of galectin-3 affects the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to TRAIL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Transfection
Human breast carcinoma cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100
U/mL), and streptomycin (50 U/mL) in a 95% air/5%
carbon dioxide incubator at 37 C. BT549 cells were
obtained from Dr. E. W. Thompson, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC. The breast cancer cell lines Gl101A, BT474, and BT20 were obtained
from Dr. Janet E. Price at the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Additional breast
cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va).
The establishment of a stable neo-resistant control
vector-transfected BT549 clone (BT549/V) and 2 His64
galectin-3-transfected BT549 clones (25A and 25B) was
previously described.5 A full-length galectin-3 cDNA
encoding Pro64 galectin-3 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from
BT549 cells and subcloned into an expression plasmid. A
second cDNA encoding His64 galectin-3 was generated
by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Genotype Analysis
Galectin-3 genotype was determined by PCRâ€“singlestrand conformation polymorphism and PCR-based
restriction fragment length polymorphism of genomic
DNA isolated from cultured breast cancer cells. The
rs4644 assay (ss2990728) uses the forward primer
TTGATCAGCTCCACATGGTTG and the reverse
primer GAGAAGTGGCTCTAAGCAGCAG (35 cycles
with 95 C for 0.5 minutes, 60 C for 0.5 minutes, and
72 C for 3.0 minutes). Sequencing of the 1040 nt product in both directions provided the genotype at the rs4644
as well as the rs4652 locus and the common intronic single nucleotide polymorphism rs2075598.

Western Blot Analysis
Total cell lysate extractions and Western blot analyses
were performed as previously described.5 Protein concentrations were measured using a DC protein assay reagent
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif). Equal amounts of protein
were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was
probed with monoclonal anti-galectin-3, anti-PTEN,
anti-Akt, and antiâ€“phospho-Akt.5 Antiâ€“b-actin (Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo) was used to monitor
equal loading in each lane. Immunoreactivity was
detected by sequential incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway NJ).
Cytotoxicity Assays
Cell viability was assessed by the MTT (3-(4; 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide)
assay (Sigma Chemical Company). The cells (10,000/
well) were seeded into 96-lL plates and grown overnight.
After 4 hours of treatment with 100 ng/mL of TRAIL or
16 hours of treatment with 5 ug/mL of doxorubicin,
MTT solution was added to a final concentration of 1
mg/mL for 3 hours at 37 C, followed by 200 lL of dimethyl sulfoxide (Fisher Biotech, Fairlawn, NJ). Colorimetric reading at 570 mm was performed using an MRX
Revelation microplate reader (Dynex, Chantilly, Va). The
results are expressed as the mean percentage cytotoxicity
from triplicate cultures.

RESULTS
Galectin-3 Genotype and Expression
When a collection of breast cancer cell lines was examined
for LGALS3 genotype, 6 of 10 were homozygous for
Pro64 galectin-3, 2 of 10 were homozygous for His64
galectin-3, and 2 of 10 were heterozygous (Fig. 1). Galectin-3 protein was detected in the lysates of 9 of the 10 cell
lines. BT549 (homozygous Pro64 genotype) was galectin3 null.
TRAIL Sensitivity of Breast Cancer Cell Lines
Expressing His64 Galectin-3
The 9 breast cancer cell lines that expressed galectin-3
were assayed for sensitivity to TRAIL (Fig. 2A). None of
the homozygous Pro64 cell lines was found to be sensitive
to TRAIL, but both of the homozygous His64 cell lines

and 1 of 2 heterozygous cell lines were sensitive to TRAIL.
These results indicate that TRAIL resistance is associated
with the homozygous Pro64 genotype (P < .05 by the
Fisher exact test.) Among the 9 breast cancer cell lines
tested, sensitivity to doxorubicin was not found to be dependent on galectin-3 genotype (Fig. 2B). Two of the 5
Pro64 homozygous cell lines were relatively resistant to
doxorubicin, whereas 1 of 4 cell lines that were heterozygous or homozygous for His64 galectin-3 was found to be
relatively resistant to doxorubicin.

Figure 1. Genotype and expression levels of galectin-3 are
shown in breast cancer cell lines. Lectin, galactoside-binding,
soluble, 3 (LGALS3) genotype at the rs4644 locus was determined by sequence analysis. Expression of the galectin-3
protein was determined by Western blot analysis. PP indicates homozygous Pro64; HP, heterozygous; HH, homozygous His64.

Forced Expression of Galectin-3 of Defined
Genotype in Galectin-3 Null Cells
To more directly test the effect of the Pro64His mutation
of galectin-3 on TRAIL sensitivity, galectin-3 null cells
were engineered to express either His64 galectin-3 or
Pro64 galectin-3. Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) indicated
that parental BT549 cells have undetectable levels of
galectin-3 protein, but multiple clones express high levels
of His64 galectin-3 (clones 25A and 25B) or Pro64 galectin-3 (clones 25C, B3, and C2). Previous studies have
shown that TRAIL sensitivity in 2 His64 galectin-3â€“
transfected BT549 clones (25A and 25B) results from the
induction of PTEN, which inactivates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway.5 In contrast, expression of Pro64 galectin-3 (25C, B3, and C2) is
not associated with PTEN expression, and does not lead
to a reduction in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3).
TRAIL Sensitivity and Doxorubicin
Resistance Conferred by His64 Galectin-3
Parental BT549 cells and vector control-transfected cells,
both of which are galectin-3 null, were assayed for
TRAIL-dependent cytotoxicity and found to be resistant
to TRAIL (Fig. 4A). High levels of expression of His64
galectin-3 rendered the BT549 cells sensitive to TRAIL.

Figure 2. Sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and doxorubicin is
shown. Cells of homozygous His64 genotype (open bars), heterozygous (hashed bars), or homozygous Pro64 (solid bars) were
treated (A) for 4 hours with 100 ng/mL of TRAIL or (B) overnight with 5 ug/mL of doxorubicin and cell viability was determined
with the MTT assay.

Figure 3. Forced expression of galectin-3 of defined genotype in BT549 galectin-3 null breast cancer cells is shown.
Western blot analysis detection of galectin-3, phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN), Akt, and phospho-Akt (P-Akt) is
shown in total cell lysates of stable transfectants. BT indicates BT549 parental cells; VC, control containing vehicle
plasmid; 25A and 25B, His64 galectin-3â€“expressing clones;
25C, B3, and C2, Pro64 galectin-3â€“expressing clones. b-Actin
expression is shown as a loading control.

In contrast, BT549 cells expressing Pro64 galectin-3
remained resistant to TRAIL, despite high levels of galectin-3 protein expression. These results indicate that the
naturally occurring Pro64His mutation in galectin-3
increases sensitivity to death receptor-mediated apoptosis.
In examining sensitivity to doxorubicin, we found that parental BT549 and cells transfected with Pro64 galectin-3
cDNA were sensitive to doxorubicin (Fig. 4B). In contrast, high levels of expression of His64 galectin-3 rendered the BT549 cells resistant to doxorubicin. Thus, in
BT549 cells, His64 galectin-3 can confer TRAIL sensitivity and doxorubicin resistance, whereas Pro64 galectin-3
appears to have no effect. However, the relation between
LGALS3 genotype and doxorubicin sensitivity may differ
among breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrate that TRAIL
sensitivity of breast cancer cells is associated with His64
galectin-3. The finding that galectin-3 null cells, similar
to cells expressing Pro64 galectin-3, are TRAIL resistant
argues against the alternative explanation, which is that
TRAIL resistance depends on the expression of Pro64
galectin-3. It was reported earlier that His64 galectin-3
but not Pro64 galectin-3 confers relative resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in BT549 cells.8 We found a

4378

similar trend toward sensitivity to doxorubicin in derivatives of BT549 cells expressing galectin-3 of a defined genotype. The introduction of a galectin-3 cDNA encoding
galectin-3 with His64 into BT549 galectin-3 null cells
rendered the BT549 cells sensitive to TRAIL and resistant
to doxorubicin. However, among the 9 galectin-3â€“positive cell lines tested, there was no clear association noted
between galectin-3 genotype and doxorubicin sensitivity.
Galectin-3 may exert antiapoptotic3 or proapop5
totic activity depending on the cell type and the nature of
the stimulus, and the results of the current study indicate
that the His64/Pro64 polymorphism can influence this
balance. To our knowledge, the mechanisms by which
galectin-3 can be either antiapoptotic or proapoptotic are
not fully understood, but could include different contributions of the mitochondrial (intrinsic) versus the death
receptor (extrinsic) apoptosis pathway or could reflect distinct functions of galectin-3 depending on nuclear versus
cytoplasmic localization.
Several mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in cancer have been identified.13 These include
alteration in death receptors and decoy receptors, in
death-inducing signaling complex assembly, in caspase,
in inhibitors of apoptosis, and in downstream signaling.
In the case of BT549, galectin-3 has been shown to play a
pivotal role in promoting TRAIL sensitivity through upregulation of PTEN and inactivation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.5 In contrast, nuclear PTEN can have the
opposite effect, protecting against DNA damage, leading
to decreased apoptosis.14 However, to our knowledge, it is
not yet known whether the His64/Pro64 polymorphism
of galectin-3 influences PTEN localization. In the current
study, we found that expression of Pro64 galectin-3 in
BT549 cells did not lead to expression of PTEN and loss
of phospho-Akt. However, it is not known whether the
same mechanism is responsible for the TRAIL resistance
observed in other breast cancer cells lines that express
Pro64 galectin-3.
Because the His64 allele has been reported to be
associated with increased breast cancer incidence,8 it
might be expected that many breast cancer cell lines would
be homozygous for His64 galectin-3. Among the 10 cell
lines examined in the current study, there was not a pronounced overabundance of the His64 allele. The Pro64His mutation in galectin-3 is common in Caucasian
individuals, but lower in incidence in African-American
and Asian populations, mirroring the higher incidence of
breast cancer in Caucasians. If the His64/Pro64 polymorphism in the gene for galectin-3 is associated with TRAIL

sensitivity, this could be relevant to the disparities in
breast cancer outcomes noted across population groups,
and could guide the design of future clinical trials of
TRAIL-based therapies.
Because breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, there is a continuing need to predict which patients
are likely to be sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy to
tailor treatment accordingly. Because TRAIL is preferentially cytotoxic to cancer cells, as opposed to normal cells,
it is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.
Based on the finding that the naturally occurring P64H
mutation in galectin-3 increases sensitivity to TRAIL and
may decrease the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin, it is hypothesized that the LGALS3 rs4644 polymorphism could be used to predict the chemosensitivity
versus chemoresistance of breast cancers.
