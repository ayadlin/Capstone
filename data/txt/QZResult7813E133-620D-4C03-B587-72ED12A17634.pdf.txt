BACKGROUND: Only a portion of breast cancer patients currently selected for trastuzumab therapy respond.
METHODS: Using a novel assay (HERmark) to quantify total human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
expression, the authors examined outcomes in 102 trastuzumab-treated metastatic breast cancer patients previously
assessed as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3þ by local but not central IHC, or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
positive, and then retested by central FISH. RESULTS: Of 102 MBC patients previously scored as IHC 3þ or 2þ/FISHpositive and treated with trastuzumab-containing regimens, 98 had both central FISH and HER2 total expression values. Sixty-six of 76 central FISH-positive patients (87%) had high HER2 total expression levels (concordant positive),
and 19 of 22 central FISH-negative patients (86%) were HER2 total expression low (concordant negative). Fourteen
percent (3 of 22) of central FISH-negative patients were HER2 total expression high (discordant HER2 total expression high), and 13% (10 of 76) of central FISH-positive patients were HER2 total expression low (discordant HER2
total expression low). The concordant positive group had a significantly longer time to progression (TTP, median ¼
11.3 months) compared with the concordant negative group (median TTP, 4.5 months; hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.42, P <
.001), and also compared with the discordant HER2 total expression low group (median TTP, 3.7 months; HR ¼ 0.43,
P ¼ .01). The discordant HER2 total expression low group behaved similarly compared with concordant negatives (HR
¼ 1, P ¼ .99). In analyses restricted to central FISH-positive patients only (n ¼ 77), Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression identified HER2 total expression as an independent predictor of TTP (HR ¼ 0.29, P ¼ .0015) and overall
survival (HR ¼ 0.19, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of patients with HER2 gene amplification by FISH express
low levels of HER2 protein and have reduced response to trastuzumab-containing therapy, similar to FISH-negative

The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, targeting the
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has
been shown to offer significant disease-free and overall
survival (OS) advantages in both the metastatic and adjuvant settings in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer.1-5 Normally, HER2 activates signaling pathways
by dimerizing with ligand-bound epidermal growth factor
receptor-family members such as HER1 and HER3. To
date, no ligand has been identified for HER2 itself; thus,
it is thought that the regulation of signaling pathway activity is under the control of the receptor requiring ligand
activation.6 In situations where HER2 is pathologically
overexpressed, the receptor may homodimerize and activate signaling cascades in the absence of the normal regulatory control imposed by the requirement for ligand
binding of its heterodimerization partners.7-10
Current methodologies for the selection of HER2positive patients include immunohistochemistry (IHC) to
detect HER2 protein overexpression, and fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) to detect amplification of
HER2. Using these methods, only a fraction of HER2positive patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC)
respond to trastuzumab, and a significant proportion of
the responders relapse within 1 year. Prior efforts to correlate quantitative measures of HER2 status (eg, HER2 gene
copy number) with clinical outcome have been disappointing.11-16 Whereas IHC and FISH assays performed
by experienced pathologists at central laboratories have
been shown to be reliable and predictive of trastuzumab
benefit,16 recent data from the adjuvant setting have called
the accuracy of local IHC and FISH into question, suggesting that some patients who may benefit from trastuzumab are being missed using the current assays.17,18 New
approaches to the assessment of HER2 status may allow
for more accurate identification of patients who are likely
to benefit from trastuzumab.19
This study involved the use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens from a cohort of
patients with MBC who were all assessed as HER2 overexpressed (IHC 3þ) and/or gene-amplified (FISH positive),
and who received trastuzumab at a single institution. We
used a novel assay to make precise quantitative measure-

ments of HER2 protein expression, and correlated them
with results obtained by local IHC and central FISH, as
well as with clinical outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study population comprised patients who were prospectively observed during trastuzumab-based therapy at
the Medical University of Vienna between 1999 and
2006 (only outpatients, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status 0-2, age >18 years, estimated
life expectancy >12 weeks) with HER2-overexpressing
(>10% of tumor cells IHC 3þ as determined by the HercepTest; Dako Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) and/or
HER2-amplified MBC (with positive FISH testing mandatory in all IHC 2þ cases). In addition, patients were
required to be trastuzumab-naive and have bidimensionally measurable disease progressing within 4 weeks before
initiation of treatment (excluding previously irradiated
lesions). Pregnant or breast-feeding patients, patients with
a history of congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease,
second malignancy (except in situ cervical cancer, or
adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
of the skin), severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, or altered
mental status were not eligible. Patients’ written informed
consent was obtained for documentation of disease and
treatment-related data as well as subsequent analysis of tumor tissue before initiating trastuzumab; however, not all
consented patients had tissue available for testing. All
treatment decisions were made by the treating physicians,
not the investigators. All consented patients received
planned therapy. Tissue for analysis was derived from the
primary tumor. Response to treatment was documented
by review of all imaging studies according to Southwest
Oncology Group criteria as previously described,20 and
data on HER2 and hormone receptor status were retrieved
from pathology reports. Archived FFPE tumor specimens
were retrieved from 131 (89%) of 147 patients. The
research protocol was approved by the Penn State University/Hershey Medical Center and Medical University of
Vienna institutional review boards. A description of the

Blinding and Analysis of Data
Anonymized clinical data and FFPE sections provided by
investigators at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria
were shipped to the coordinating center at Penn State
University/Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania. After securing the completeness of clinical information, 127 FFPE samples were shipped to Monogram
Biosciences (South San Francisco, Calif). Twenty-five
specimens were deemed inadequate for the generation of
final results; 17 patients had insufficient tumor, 6 patients

had ductal carcinoma in situ only on pathology review at
Monogram Biosciences, and 2 patient sample assays failed
for technical reasons. Final results were generated for 102
patients (see Fig. 1). All HERmark assays were performed
in blinded fashion. The treating physicians were blinded
to the results of central FISH and the HERmark results.
Subsequent to testing, HER2 total expression results were
transmitted to Penn State/Hershey before receipt of clinical data at Monogram Biosciences. The patients were
exposed to a variety of different chemotherapy regimens,
either before trastuzumab or during trastuzumab therapy
(10 in all).
The HERmark Assay
The HERmark HER2 total expression assay is an application of the VeraTag technology platform designed specifically for breast cancer. VeraTag is a proximity-based
method designed to accurately and reproducibly quantify
protein expression and protein-protein complexes,
including cell surface dimers, in FFPE specimens (Fig.
2).22 The assay has been technically validated according to
the specifications prescribed by the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendment and is performed in a College
of American Pathologists-certified clinical reference laboratory at Monogram Biosciences.
Central FISH Testing
Detection of HER2 gene amplification in HERmarktested specimens was performed in 1 batch by a single pathologist at the Medical University of Vienna using the
Vysis assay (Abbott-Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill). The

central pathologist was blinded to the local HER2 results
and to the HERmark results. FISH assays were performed
using contiguous sections from the same tissue block as
the HERmark measurements. For each specimen, the
HER2 and CEP17 signals of >50 nuclei of invasive tumor
areas were recorded. Tumors were classified as FISH-positive if the HER2/CEP17 ratio exceeded 2.2.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed independently at
Monogram Biosciences and Penn State and then compared. Determination of clinical cutoffs for HER2 total
expression occurred before the performance of central
FISH assays in Vienna, by positional scanning analysis
and selection of the cutoff associated with the lowest P
value for time to progression (TTP). Clinical cutoffs did
not change during subsequent analyses comparing central
FISH and HERmark results.
Correlation of HER2 total expression with objective
response rate (complete response [CR] þ partial response
[PR]/all patients) and clinical benefit (CR þ PR þ stable
disease [SD] 6 months/all patients) used the test for
trend, Kaplan-Meier analyses used the log-rank test, and
multivariate analyses used Cox proportional hazards
regression in the R statistical package. Graphpad (La Jolla,
Calif) Prizm was used to generate all graphs. All P values

are 2-tailed. Measurements of HER2 total expression
were tested for correlation with TTP and OS. TTP was
defined as the time from the initiation of trastuzumabcontaining treatment to progression (Southwest Oncology Group) or censoring, and OS was defined as the time
from initiation of trastuzumab-containing treatment to
death or censoring. Patients were classified as either high
or low for HER2 total expression based on the clinical
cutoff originally identified for TTP. High and low groups
were compared for time-to-event endpoints using
Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazards models
were fitted to determine the most significant correlates
with outcome, and the assumption of proportional hazards was tested for each variable. Potential prognostic factors included HER2 total expression  versus < cutoff,
continuous values of HER2 total expression, HER2 status
by FISH (amplified vs not amplified, where amplified was
defined as having 2.2 HER2 copies per chromosome 17
centromere), FISH total copy number, FISH copy number per chromosome 17 centromere number (FISH/
CEP17), IHC score, age, treatment group (trastuzumabonly or trastuzumab plus chemotherapy), estrogen and
progesterone receptor status, time from metastasis to
treatment, and time from surgery to treatment. Total
number of sites of metastasis was considered both as a
continuous and categorical (<3 vs 3 sites) variable. A
log transformation was applied to HER2 total expression
to reduce the asymmetry of the distribution of this variable. All possible Cox models were tested, and those with
the lowest P values were considered the best models.

RESULTS
Description of the Clinical Cohort
HERmark testing was performed on 102 patients who
had previously been assessed as IHC 3þ (95 of 102), IHC
2þ/ FISH positive (5 of 102), or IHC unknown/ FISH
positive (2 of 102). Central FISH results were obtained
for 99 of 102 patients (missing data because of <50 tumor
cells [1 patient] and inadequate material [2 patients]).
Twenty-two of 99 patients were assessed as central FISH
negative. All of these tumors were IHC 3þ on prior testing. Seventy-seven of 99 tumors were central FISH
positive.
Correlation of HER2 Expression With
IHC and Central FISH
The distribution of HER2 total expression was determined for the entire cohort and compared with IHC (Fig.

HER2 total expression values ranged over approximately
2 to 2.5 logs, and the distributions for specimens scored
by IHC as 2þ or 3þ overlapped (Fig. 3 Top). The
medians of the HER2 total expression values in central
FISH-positive versus central FISH-negative subpopulations were significantly different (Mann-Whitney P value
<.0001); however, significant overlap in the distributions
of values was observed (Fig. 3 Bottom).

Clinical Outcomes After Treatment With

of measured HER2 total expression. Objective response
rate was calculated for each subgroup of patients, and an

cutoff with the lowest associated P value was selected. For

subgroup and 10.3 months for the FISH-positive
subgroup.
Identical Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed
using HER2 total expression. Cutoffs determined by positional scanning (Fig. 6) were used to discriminate high
from low HER2 total expression ( vs <log10 HER2 total
expression ¼ 1.25). Statistically significant relationships
were observed with those patients exhibiting higher levels
of HER2 total expression (HR ¼ 0.40, P < .001) experiencing longer TTP than those patients with lower HER2
total expression (Fig. 5 Bottom). Median TTP was 4.4

ues below the cutoff, and 11.3 months for those with
HER2 total expression values above the cutoff. Univariate
Kaplan-Meier analyses were also performed using OS as
the clinical outcome endpoint. Neither FISH nor HER2
total expression were significantly associated with OS.
The median OS for patients in the FISH-negative subgroup was 28.7 months compared with 31.8 months for
those who were FISH-positive (P ¼ .29). For HER2 total
expression, those below versus those above the cutoffs had a
median OS of 28.7 versus 37.4 months (P ¼ .16). Cox proportional hazards multivariate analyses were performed
including all patients in the cohort (N ¼ 102) (Table 2) to
identify variables that were significantly associated with
clinical outcome on trastuzumab. Initial analyses excluding
HER2 total expression demonstrated, as expected, that
FISH status was a significant correlate of TTP (HR ¼
0.48, P ¼ .006). When the categorical variable HER2 total
expression ( vs <cutoff) was added to the analysis, FISH
status dropped out of the model (HR ¼ 1.0, P ¼ .94) and
was replaced by HER2 total expression as a significant correlate of TTP (HR ¼ 0.44, P ¼ .042). The presence of 3 or
more metastatic sites (HR ¼ 2.6-2.7, P < .001) was a significant correlate in both models.
Similar Cox multivariate analyses using OS as the
outcome measure showed that FISH was not a significant
correlate of OS in either model, but HER2 total expression trended toward statistical significance (HR ¼ 0.4, P
¼ .058) (Table 2). The presence of 3 or more metastatic
sites (HR ¼ 1.6, P < .001), estrogen receptor positivity

Models were generated using the entire cohort (N¼102), and examining the significance of central FISH status
without and then with the inclusion of H2T. Subsequently, multivariate Cox analyses were performed on the subset of the cohort that was FISH-positive by central testing (n¼77).

(HR ¼ 0.48-0.49, P ¼ .03), and age (HR ¼ 0.97, P ¼
.021-.048) were also significant correlates in both models.
Cox proportional hazards multivariate analyses were
also conducted on the subgroup of patients who were central FISH positive (n ¼ 77) (Table 2) to examine the prognostic ability of HER2 total expression in a stringently
selected population of patients with HER2 gene amplification. For these analyses, both HER2 total copy number
and HER2/CEP17 ratio were included as continuous variables along with the categorical ( vs <cutoff) and continuous measures of HER2 total expression. In both the
TTP (HR ¼ 0.29, P ¼ .0015) and OS (HR ¼ 0.19, P <
.001) analyses, the categorical variable HER2 total expression was identified as an independent correlate of outcome. Patients with HER2 total expression values above
the cutoff exhibited longer TTP and longer OS than those
who had HER2 total expression values below the cutoff.

Other significant variables included number of metastatic
sites, line of therapy, time from surgery to initiation of
trastuzumab therapy, and age.
Checking the assumption of proportional hazards, 2
variables: showed evidence of time dependence 1) time
from sample to trastuzumab therapy in the TTP model

Figure 7. Kaplan-Meier analyses examine outcomes (time to progression [TTP] and overall survival [OS]) associated with the 3
subpopulations defined by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and HERmark cutoffs: 1) concordant negative (FISH negative, <HER2 total expression [H2T] cutoff), 2) concordant positive (FISH positive, HER2 total expression cutoff), and 3) discordant low (FISH positive, <HER2 total expression cutoff).

characterized as central FISH negative or central FISH positive overlap. Application of the cutoff for HER2 total
expression to the distribution yields 4 groups: 1) patients
who are central FISH negative and below the cutoff for
HER2 total expression (concordant negative), 2) patients
who are central FISH positive and above the cutoff for
HER2 total expression (concordant positive), 3) patients
who are FISH negative but above the cutoff for HER2 total
expression (discordant high), and 4) patients who are central
FISH positive but below the cutoff for HER2 total expression (discordant low) (Fig. 7). The number of patients in
the discordant high group is too small to permit any further
analysis. However, the discordant low group contains 10
patients. We performed univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses
of TTP and OS to examine the behavior of the discordant
low group compared with those patients who were either
concordant negative or concordant positive.
The concordant negative group had a mean total
HER2 gene copy number of 3.2 (range, 1.7-6.0) and a

Cancer

November 15, 2010

mean HER2/CEP17 copy number ratio of 1.4 (range,
1.1-1.9). The concordant positive group had a mean total
HER2 copy number of 10 (range, 5-16) and a mean
HER2/CEP17 copy number ratio of 4.5 (range, 2.3-8.4).
The discordant low group had a mean total HER2 copy
number of 8.8 (range, 5.4-12.7) and a mean HER2/
CEP17 copy number ratio of 3.4 (range, 2.2-5).
The discordant low group generates a Kaplan-Meier
curve that tracks with the concordant negative group
rather than the concordant positive group (Fig. 7). Compared with the concordant negative group, the concordant
positive group experiences a significantly longer TTP
(HR ¼ 0.42, P < .001). Compared with the discordant
low group, the concordant positive group also experiences
a significantly longer TTP (HR ¼ 0.43, P ¼ .01). However, compared with the concordant negative group, the
discordant low group experiences a TTP that is indistinguishable (HR ¼ 1.0, P ¼ .99). Kaplan-Meier curves for
OS are also shown (Fig. 7).

All of the aforementioned analyses were also performed using HER2 homodimer levels as the VeraTag
variable, yielding nearly identical results as those using
HER2 total expression. As HER2 homodimer levels
offered no additional insight in these analyses, we have
chosen to focus our attention on the simpler HER2 total
expression measurement.
In summary, HERmark identified a subpopulation
of patients who were FISH positive for HER2 gene amplification, but expressed low levels of total HER2 protein.
These patients experienced a significantly shorter TTP on
trastuzumab compared with FISH-positive patients with
high total HER2 protein expression, and their outcomes
were indistinguishable from those of FISH-negative
patients.

DISCUSSION
Until now, the only method available for the direct measurement of the HER2 protein target has been IHC.
Although high-quality IHC testing is possible and predictive of clinical outcome to trastuzumab, this is most uniform only in a well-controlled central IHC setting. Local
IHC is often complicated by lack of sensitivity, poor specificity in FFPE specimens, and suboptimal reproducibility
because of its subjective scoring system and widespread
use across many laboratories, presenting challenges to
standardization.14-16 The HERmark assay provides an
accurate and reproducible measure of HER2 protein
expression in breast tumors prepared as FFPE specimens.22 Assay validation data developed at Monogram
Biosciences comparing HERmark measurements to centrally performed IHC in cell lines prepared as FFPE pellets, as well as to quantitative HER2 by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay and quantitative HER2 expression
by flow cytometry, demonstrate excellent concordance
with all 3 measurements, but greater ability to accurately
measure HER2 expression at low levels than IHC.23 As a
result, HERmark is able to measure a distribution of
HER2 expression extending over a large dynamic range
corresponding to approximately 2500 to 2 million receptors/cell.22,23 Measurements of gene copy number,
although predictive, capture the amplification of a segment of DNA that includes not only HER2, but other
genes that reside in contiguous regions on chromosome
17. HERmark makes a direct measurement of HER2, and
therefore can capture the impact of (post)transcriptional
and/or (post)translational regulatory events that may
influence HER2 protein expression specifically.

In this study, we have demonstrated, in a population
of patients with MBC who were IHC 3þ or FISH positive, a continuum of HER2 expression that extends over a
2 to 2.5 log dynamic range. By using a clinical cutoff
determined before generation of the central FISH results,
we identified a subset of IHC 3þ patients with HER2 values below the cutoff who responded less well than patients
above the cutoff. Approximately two-thirds of these
patients were subsequently found to be central FISH negative (19 of 29). Examination of the discordant subgroup
who were FISH positive but had HER2 total expression
values below the cutoff demonstrated that those patients
experienced clinical outcomes that were indistinguishable
from the concordant negative subgroup and significantly
different from the concordant positive subgroup. An important limitation of this analysis is that we did not have
enough material to gather central IHC data for this discordant subgroup of patients. It is possible that these represent false-positive calls by local IHC that might have
been discovered if central IHC had been performed on
these tumors.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses
involving the entire population as well as the central
FISH-positive subgroup demonstrated that quantitative
HER2 measurements outperformed FISH as a correlate
of TTP and OS.
Although existing data tell us that patients who are
gene-amplified for HER2 as measured by FISH experience better outcomes than patients who are not geneamplified when considered as a group, our results suggest
that not all patients who are gene-amplified for HER2
necessarily express high levels of the HER2 protein.
Beyond gene dosage effects attributable to HER2 gene
amplification, HER2 protein levels critically depend on
multiple regulatory networks involving transcription factors, post-transcriptional and translational regulators (eg,
microRNAs), and post-translational mediators of protein
stability or degradation such as the chaperone HSP90 and
the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, respectively. Thus, upstream
measurements may be less reliable as indicators of
response to drugs that target the protein than measurements made at the protein level. Indeed, there appear to
be at least 20 predicted microRNA binding sites in the
human HER2 mRNA (see http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/
cgibin/targets/v5/detail_view.pl?transcript_id¼ENST00
000269571), suggesting the possibility that HER2 gene
expression may be regulated post-transcriptionally.

outcomes that are similar to FISH-negative patients
may provide at least a partial explanation for the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes that are observed for
HER2-positive patients treated with trastuzumab.
Other protein biomarkers (eg, HER3 and p9524) may
also allow the identification of patients who experience suboptimal outcomes on trastuzumab, and studies examining the relationship between several of these
and clinical outcomes after trastuzumab treatment in
the MBC setting are currently in progress.
Limitations of this study include its small size, its
retrospective nature, the lack of a trastuzumab-untreated
control arm, the lack of central IHC measurements for all
patients to confirm that some of the cases included were
not HER2 IHC false positives, and the heterogeneous
chemotherapy to which patients were exposed and that
could potentially confound these analyses. All of these elements demand that we consider these results preliminary
and hypothesis-generating until they can be confirmed in
additional, larger, well-controlled studies involving
patients with breast cancer. It is not unexpected that we
should observe significant associations between HER2
total expression and TTP in this cohort, because the cutoffs used to define high and low HER2 total expression
were derived from this cohort. As such, this cohort represents a training dataset, and the observed relationships
and derived cutoffs require validation in an independent
cohort of trastuzumab-treated MBC patients before we
can say with confidence that these measurements are clinically useful. Confirmation of these results in larger clinical
trials will be necessary to use HERmark to optimize the
treatment of HER2-positive MBC patients. That said,
this is the first dataset to describe such relationships using
this new technology, and the results are consistent with
the view that measurements made at the protein level,
where the drug is targeted, may offer advantages over
measurements made further upstream at the level of the
gene.
