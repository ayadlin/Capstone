ABSTRACT
Intravesical instillation of chemotherapeutic agents is a well-established
treatment strategy to decrease recurrence following transurethral resection in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Gemcitabine is a recently developed treatment option.
However, the curative effects of gemcitabine are far from satisfactory due to de
novo or acquired drug resistance. In a previous study, we reported that intravesical
administration of the c-Myc inhibitor KSI-3716 suppresses tumor growth in an
orthotopic bladder cancer model. Here, we explored whether KSI-3716 inhibits
gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cell proliferation. As expected from the in vitro
cytotoxicity of gemcitabine in several bladder cancer cell lines, gemcitabine effectively
suppressed the growth of KU19-19 xenografts in nude mice, although all mice relapsed
later. Long-term in vitro exposure to gemcitabine induced gemcitabine-specific
resistance. Gemcitabine-resistant cells, termed KU19-19/GEM, formed xenograft
tumors even in the presence of 2 mg/kg gemcitabine. Interestingly, KU19-19/GEM
cells up-regulated c-Myc expression in the presence of the gemcitabine and resisted to
the gemcitabine, however was suppressed by the KSI-3716. The sequential addition
of gemcitabine and KSI-3716 inhibited gemcitabine-resistant cell proliferation to a
great extent than each drug alone. These results suggest that sequential treatment
with gemcitabine and KSI-3716 may be beneficial to bladder cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

gemcitabine is effective against BCG-refractory NMIBC
as well as advanced bladder cancer [5–8]. Several
randomized trials of intravesical gemcitabine therapy
demonstrate that tumor recurrence is 25–53.1% in BCGrefractory NMIBC [9].
Gemcitabine (2’,2’-difluorodeoxycytidine) is a
synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has structural
and metabolic similarities to deoxycytidine and cytosine
arabinoside [10]. Its active metabolites are incorporated
into DNA and inhibit DNA polymerase thereby inhibiting
DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis [11]. Intravenous
administration of gemcitabine is highly effective and
well tolerated; therefore, this agent is used as both a

Bladder cancer is the sixth most commonly
diagnosed cancer in the United States [1]. Approximately
80% of patients with bladder cancer present with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) initially [2, 3].
Typically, patients are treated with a complete transurethral
resection of the tumor followed by intravesical instillation
of antitumor agents. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is
the most effective adjuvant agent for treating NMIBC [4].
Nonetheless, approximately 30–40% of NMIBC patients
do not respond to BCG treatment; of the initial responders,

first- and second-line chemotherapy, in combination or
as a single agent, for the treatment of metastatic bladder
cancer [8]. A combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is
considered the standard therapy for patients with locally
advanced and metastatic bladder cancer. However, despite
reasonable response rates to initial chemotherapy in
patients with metastatic bladder cancer, long-term diseasefree survival rates remain disappointing. Gemcitabine
has shown single-agent response rates of 28–36% in
previously untreated metastatic bladder patients, with mild
myelosuppression [12].
This limited efficacy may be due to de novo drug
resistance and/or the development of a drug-resistant
cellular phenotype during treatment. Drug resistance
can be acquired at the genetic level through gene
amplification, the transcriptional level through epigenetic
modifications, or the proteomic level through mutation
or aberrant expression. Gemcitabine is predominantly
transported into the cell by human equilibrative and
concentrative nucleoside transporters (hENT and hCNT,
respectively). Cells deficient in hENT1 are highly
resistant to gemcitabine [13]. As a prodrug, gemcitabine
is phosphorylated to produce its active diphosphate and
triphosphate metabolites, which inhibit ribonucleotide
reductase (RR) and DNA synthesis, respectively.
Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is the rate-limiting enzyme in
the biotransformation of nucleoside analogs and increases
in dCK activity may improve the efficacy of gemcitabine
[14]. Furthermore, increased expression of the catabolic
enzymes 5’-nucleotidase (5’-NT) and cytidine deaminase
(CDA) has been found in many cell lines resistant to
gemcitabine [15, 16]. Finally, non-small cell lung cancer
patients with low level expression of the M1 subunit of
RR (RRM1) significantly benefited from gemcitabine/
cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy [17], while resistance
to gemcitabine was observed in cells overexpressing
both RRM1 and RRM2 [18, 19]. Additionally, faulty
processing of microRNA (miRNA) coding genes, and
consequent altered function of the miRNA, can also
result in drug resistance. For example, in bladder cancer
cell lines miRNAs 1290, 138, let-7i, and let-7b impart
resistance to gemcitabine in part through the modulation
of mucin-4 [20].
Many studies have highlighted the important
role of c-Myc in the development of drug-resistant
phenotypes in cancer [21, 22]. For instance, it has been
reported that in human breast epithelial cells, c-Myc
overexpression is coupled to the modulation of drug
transporter gene expression [23], and c-Myc inhibition
also sensitizes Lewis lung carcinoma to cisplatin, taxol,
and etoposide. Interestingly, cyclical administration
of cisplatin and c-myc antisense oligomers was more
potent than co-administration [24]. However, it is not
known if the development of gemcitabine resistance is
associated with c-Myc overexpression in bladder cancer.
Therefore, in the present study, we initially developed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a gemcitabine-resistant human bladder cancer cell line by
continuous exposure to gradually increasing, clinically
relevant doses of gemcitabine. We then addressed the
functional role of c-Myc during the development of
gemcitabine resistance and further investigated the
efficacy of a c-Myc inhibitor against gemcitabineresistant bladder cancer cells.

RESULTS
Gemcitabine is cytotoxic to various bladder
cancer cell lines
Gemcitabine is already recognized as one of the
most effective chemotherapeutic agents against bladder
cancer. Here, we confirmed that gemcitabine effectively
inhibits the proliferation of various bladder cancer cell
lines and then determined the dose required to block
bladder cell proliferation. Each bladder cell line was
exposed to various concentrations of gemcitabine.
Following incubation for 72 hrs, cell survival was
determined by a cell viability assay. When cells were
incubated for 72 hrs, gemcitabine inhibited cell survival
by more than 70% at 0.1 μM in all cell lines tested. In
most cell lines, a small number of cells survived doses
as high as 10 μM gemcitabine. We hypothesized that
the observed inhibition of survival resulted from cell
cycle arrest and consequent apoptosis. Thus, cell cycle
progression and apoptosis were analyzed. As expected,
as gemcitabine is known to block DNA synthesis, flow
cytometer analysis showed that a large proportion of
cells in both the KU19-19 (40.19%) and T24 (28.56%)
cell lines were in an apoptotic state. The proportion of
cells undergoing apoptosis in the 253J and MBT-2 mouse
bladder cancer cell line was relatively small (5.29% and
4.93%, respectively), although a large fraction of cells
were arrested in the G2/M phase (Figure 1).

In vivo tumors develop resistance to gemcitabine
Next, gemcitabine-mediated in vivo tumor
growth inhibition was evaluated. KU19-19 xenografts
were established in BALB/c nude mice and mice were
intraperitoneally administered gemcitabine at a dose of
2 mg/kg twice a week for 3 weeks (Figure 2). Generally,
gemcitabine potently suppressed tumor growth provided
that treatment was administered for at least six cycles.
However, tumor growth was occasionally observed even
after six treatment cycles, although growth rates were
lower than in the control group (Figure 2, ■). These
results indicate that gemcitabine slowed tumor growth
rather than eliminating tumors. To determine whether
tumors became resistant to gemcitabine or could be further
suppressed with longer gemcitabine treatment, tumors
were extracted, implanted into other BALB/c nude mice,
and exposed to 2 mg/kg gemcitabine via intraperitoneal

following formula: length × (width)2 × 0.5236. At day 30, tumors from gemcitabine-treated mice were harvested and implanted in new
BALB/c mice (6 weeks old). Mice were then treated with 2 mg/kg of gemcitabine twice a week for 3 weeks again (▲, 2nd gemcitabine

group) grew as fast as the tumors in the control group
(■), suggesting that the initial tumors (●, 1st gemcitabine
group) were already resistant to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine
resistance was not dependent on tumor size and drug
penetration; instead, it is likely that a population of tumor
cells acquired resistance or was inherently resistant to
gemcitabine.

resistant to gemcitabine. Microarray data for KU19-19
and KU19-19/GEM cells also revealed several genes that
were associated with cancer stem cell-like phenotypes of
drug resistance (data not shown). Next, the effect of high
doses of gemcitabine (up to 10 µM) on KU19-19/GEM cell
proliferation was examined. The intercalating reagent EdU
was continuously incorporated into KU19-19/GEM cells
during DNA replication, in contrast to KU19-19 cells where
little or no incorporation was observed, indicating that even
high doses of gemcitabine fail to prevent KU19-19/GEM
cell proliferation (Figure 3B). Next, we questioned whether
KU19-19/GEM cells could still form tumors in mice.
KU19-19/GEM cells (2 × 106) were injected into the flank
of BALB/c nude mice and tumor growth was monitored
in the presence or absence of gemcitabine (Figure 3C). As
shown, KU19-19/GEM cells retained the ability to form
tumors, like the parental cell line KU19-19. As expected
from the in vitro data, gemcitabine had no effect on KU1919/GEM-derived tumor growth. Tumor sections harvested
from mice were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin
staining, and TUNEL assays to observe apoptotic cells.
As shown in Figure 3D and 3E, KU19-19/GEM cells were
morphologically different from KU19-19 cells, and tumors
from KU19-19 exhibited extensive apoptotic areas in the
presence of gemcitabine.

Establishment of gemcitabine-resistant
KU19-19 cells
After observing that a number of cells survived
treatment with 0.1 μM gemcitabine to become the
dominant culture in a tissue culture plate, we developed
a gemcitabine-resistant cell line, termed KU19-19/GEM,
by continuous exposure of KU19-19 cells to step-wise
increasing concentrations of gemcitabine (0.1–10 μM). To
evaluate whether KU19-19/GEM cells were selectively
resistant to gemcitabine, KU19-19/GEM cells were
exposed to a number of other drugs. As shown in Figure 3A,
gemcitabine had no effect on KU19-19/GEM cells,
whereas all other chemotherapeutic agents tested markedly
reduced KU19-19/GEM (and KU19-19) cell proliferation,
suggesting that KU19-19/GEM cells are selectively

The c-Myc inhibitor KSI-3716 effectively induces
KU19-19/GEM cell death

contribute to cell survival or gemcitabine resistance, and
c-Myc inhibitors could be effective agents for inhibition
of cell proliferation. We previously demonstrated that
intravesical instillation of the c-Myc inhibitor KSI-3716
markedly inhibits tumor growth in a mouse orthotopic
bladder cancer model [25]. Thus, we investigated whether
KSI-3716 could also inhibit the proliferation of KU1919/GEM cells. KSI-3716 inhibited cell survival by
85% at 2 μM in the KU19-19/GEM cell line and was
much more cytotoxic than the c-Myc inhibitor 10058F4 (Figure 5A). Cell proliferation in the presence of
KSI-3716 was determined using an EdU incorporation
assay, which confirmed a marked inhibition of DNA
synthesis at 2 μM KSI-3716 (Figure 5B). However,
when cells were treated with another c-Myc inhibitor
10058-F4 at doses of up to 10 μM, no inhibition of cell
proliferation was observed (data not shown). Poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 cleavage were
detected by western blotting, and indicated induction of
apoptosis (Figure 5C), consistent with the inhibition of
cell proliferation (above).

Since c-myc gene amplification is found in up to
30% of bladder cancer patients, immunohistochemical
staining of a tissue microarray was performed to
evaluate c-Myc expression in bladder tumors. Three
different staining patterns were identified in the bladder
tumor samples (Supplementary Figure 1A) and are
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Furthermore,
all the bladder cell lines tested also showed high
levels of c-myc transcripts, as determined by PCR
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Since cancer cells are
highly likely to modulate their protein expression in
response to a cytotoxic milieu, c-Myc expression was
investigated in the presence of gemcitabine. Cells were
exposed to 10 μM gemcitabine for 24 and 48 hrs, and
c-Myc protein was detected by immunoblot analysis
(Figure 4). Interestingly, KU19-19/GEM cells expressed
higher levels of c-Myc protein (by 30%) in the presence
of gemcitabine. These results suggest that c-Myc may

KSI-3716 to the surviving gemcitabine-resistant cells after
removal of gemcitabine (Figure 6). Sequential addition of

than each drug alone. These results suggest that KSI-3716
could be used upon termination of gemcitabine treatment

improve response rates to systemic therapy. This strategy
has been tested in NMIBC. However, studies have not
identified any clear benefit to doing so in intravesical
therapy.
During the last several decades, a number of
chemotherapeutic agents have been introduced and
protocols established to reflect different types of cancer
and patient physiology. However, drug resistance is a
major problem. Furthermore, patients face the emergence
of multidrug resistance (MDR), defined as resistance
to structurally or functionally unrelated drugs. There
are two types of MDR; intrinsic and acquired [27, 28].
For patients with gemcitabine refractory cancer, it is
sometimes assumed that they are less likely to receive
benefits from other conventional chemotherapies. Here,
we demonstrated that the c-Myc inhibitor KSI-3716
was cytotoxic to gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer
cells, suggesting that c-Myc inhibitors could be a viable
treatment option when MDR is involved. In addition to
gemcitabine-resistant cells, KSI-3716 also effectively
induced cell death in paclitaxel-resistant KU19-19 cells, as
shown in Supplementary Figure 3. Since the transcription
factor, c-Myc plays a critical role in cancer initiation
and progression [29], inhibition of c-Myc expression or
activity could also be an effective therapeutic strategy for
MDR, including gemcitabine resistance.
Deregulation of c-Myc is critical for the
development of many human cancers [22]. New evidence

DISCUSSION
Transurethral resection followed by intravesical
immuno- or chemotherapy is the standard therapy to
prevent recurrence and progression in patients with
intermediate to high risk NMIBC. The most commonly
used drug for intravesical therapy is the BCG agent.
Although widely used, there can be significant adverse
reactions to BCG and a high risk of treatment failure.
When patients do not respond to BCG or recur eventually,
a radical cystectomy remains standard treatment.
However, many patients are medically unfit and refuse this
operation because radical cystectomies are also associated
with significant morbidity and reduced quality of life
[26]. Urothelical carcinoma is characterized by chemosensitivity and best responses are seen using multidrug
platinum-based regimens in metastatic or advanced
bladder cancer. Combining different agents can decrease
chemotherapy resistance and is often successfully used to

has uncovered a previously unknown mechanism
whereby increased abundance of c-Myc can promote
PARP-dependent DNA repair pathways and induce
relative chemo-resistance [21]. In a previous report, we
demonstrated that KSI-3716, which inhibits c-Myc/MAX/
DNA complex formation, can be instilled into the bladder
to effectively suppress tumor growth without noticeable
systemic toxicity, demonstrating a novel use for c-Myc
inhibitors. Here, we established a gemcitabine-resistant
cell line, termed KU191-9/GEM. Interestingly, KU19-19/
GEM cells were selectively resistant to gemcitabine, but
not to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C. These
data suggest that a combination of gemcitabine plus any
of the above may be useful treatment for gemcitabineresistant cells.
Interestingly, simultaneous addition of KSI-3716
and gemcitabine did not increase cytotoxicity compared
with c-Myc inhibitor alone (Supplementary Figure 2),
suggesting that the cell survival response to one drug
blocks the cytotoxic action of the other drug. However,
sequential addition augmented cytotoxic anti-cancer
effects in KU19-19 cells. Drug resistance develops
through a number of mechanisms [27, 28], specifically: 1)
changes in tumor structure, such as vasculature leakage
and tumor hypoxia; and 2) modulation of gene expression,
including oncogenes, DNA repair genes, and changes in
sensitivity to growth factors and nutrients. Therefore,
it is likely that gemcitabine-resistant KU19-19 cells
temporarily up-regulate genes required for drug resistance,
such as anti-apoptotic genes, so that sequential addition is
more effective than simultaneous treatment.
Cancer stem cells are recognized as the underlying
cause of tumor initiation, recurrence, and growth [30,
31]. In addition, the main reason for drug resistance is
the incomplete removal of cancer stem cells [32] and
MDR cells have stem-like properties [33]. As shown in
Figure 3D, the phenotype of the KU19-19/GEM cells
were quite different from that of the KU19-19 cells and
considered undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). We investigated gene expression profiles in
KU19-19 and KU19-19/GEM cells using microarrays,
and focused on cancer stem cell-related genes (data not
shown). Notably, KU19-19/GEM cells overexpressed
stem cell-related genes, including CXCR4, Sox9 and
Sox2. These data suggest that KU19-19/GEM could
have a cancer stem cell-like phenotype that mediates
gemcitabine resistance.
For clinical applications, although c-Myc inhibitors
are generally considered to be non-tolerable due to
systemic toxicity, our previous results and the current
study demonstrate that KSI-3716 can be used to treat
tumors intravesically regardless of gemcitabine resistance.
Sequential treatment with KSI-3716 therefore represents
a promising new strategy for the clinical applications of
gemcitabine.

Cell lines and cell culture
Human (T24 and 253J) and mouse (MBT-2)
bladder cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The
human bladder cancer cell line KU19-19 was donated by
Dr. Ozu (Tokyo Medical University) and maintained in
minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Cell cycle analysis and detection of apoptosis
and cytotoxicity
To quantify cell proliferation, a cell proliferation
assay (CellTiter-Glo, Promega, Madison, WI) was
performed using the standard protocol, with some
modifications. Briefly, 3 × 103 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates, 2 days later cells were exposed to chemotherapeutic
agents, and cell proliferation was measured the next
day. All experiments were performed in quintuple. For
cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested, washed, fixed
with ice-cold 70% ethanol, and stained with 50 μg/ml
propidium iodide (PI) in the presence of 100 U RNase A
for 30 min at 37°C. For flow cytometer analysis, at least
10,000 events were acquired and results were analyzed
with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Diego,
CA). EdU cell proliferation assays were performed using
the Click-iT EdU assay kit (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded
into 96-well black plates and incubated at 37°C for 1 day.
Chemotherapeutic agents of interest were added to each
well at a final concentration of 0 to 10 μM. Following
incubation for 6 hrs, 10 μM of EdU was added to the
cell culture plate for 18 hrs, and cells were fixed with
formaldehyde. The fixed cells were permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Finally, intercalated EdU was detected with 5 μM Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated azide and visualized by fluorescence
microscopy.

Western blotting and histological analysis
For western blot analyses, cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Lois, MO). Proteins (20–50 µg) were resolved by SDSPAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membranes
were probed with antibodies against c-Myc, PARP, or
caspase 3 (all from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and the
subsequent corresponding secondary antibody (Jackson
Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, MA) was
detected using an Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL)
Plus kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For
histological analyses, tumor sections of 5–10 μm were

The TUNEL assay was performed using a one-step
TUNEL kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to label free 3’OH
DNA termini in KU19-19 tumors. For the detection of
apoptotic cells, tumor sections were mounted on slides,
rinsed with PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100 for 2 min on ice. The TUNEL assay was then
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cyanine 3-labeled TUNEL-positive cells were imaged
under a fluorescence microscope. Cells labeled with red
fluorescence were considered apoptotic.

Supplementary Figure S1. c-Myc is highly expressed in all bladder cancer cells and in some bladder tumor samples on
tissue microarray (TMA). (A) C-Myc expression in patient samples prepared in the form of a bladder cancer TMA was analyzed by
immunohistochemistry using an anti-c-Myc antibody. On the basis of staining results, patients were grouped into high, intermediatelow,
and low negative Expression of c-Myc, compared with their normal tissue. (B) Total RNA was prepared from each sample and 1 μg was
reverse-transcribed. PCR was performed to detect c-myc transcripts in the synthesized cDNA.

Supplementary Figure S2. Simultaneous addition of KSI-3716 and gemcitabine did not increase cytotoxicity compared with
gemcitabine c-Myc inhibitor alone. KU19-19 cells were exposed to 0 – 10 μM of KSI-3716 with or without gemcitabine. Regardless of
gemcitabine concentration, there was no additional effect in the cytotoxicity of KSI-3716.

Supplementary Figure S3. c-Myc inhibitor KSI-3716 is effectively kills paclitaxel-resistant KU19-19 cells. We also established

paclitaxel-resistant KU19-19 cell (termed KU19-19/Pacli) and its IC50 value was 10,000 fold higher than parental paclitaxel-sensitive
KU19-19 cell. Interestingly, there was no difference between two cells’ sensitivity to KSI-3716.
