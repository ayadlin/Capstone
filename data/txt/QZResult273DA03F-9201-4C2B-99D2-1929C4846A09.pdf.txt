account for the conversion of CaP into a castration-resistant state,
including the aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR) by
peptide growth factors and ligands for G protein–coupled receptors
(GPCR; refs. 2–4). If true, these mediators and components of their
signal pathways are potential targets for therapeutic intervention
of castration-resistant CaP. It has been reported that androgen
withdrawal from androgen-dependent CaP cells (5) or treatment
with stimuli such as interleukin 6 and forskolin in vitro promotes
the acquisition of the neuroendocrine phenotype through transdifferentiation (6). Cumulative evidence suggests that neuroendocrine differentiation of CaP may be a cofactor involved in tumor
progression and androgen independence (7).
Neuroendocrine cells are identified by their neurosecretory
granules and expression of neuron-specific markers including
chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and mitogenic neuropeptides such as bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP),
somatostatin, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone-related peptides (7). Neuropeptides have been identified as potent paracrine
and autocrine growth factors in human cancers including lung,
gastrointestinal, pancreatic, brain, and prostate cancers (8–13). In
prostate cancer, previous studies by others and by us have shown
that neuropeptides promote cell growth (14), migration and
protease expression in PC-3 cells (15), and androgen-independence
in LNCaP cells (3, 5). Androgen independence in CaP patients is
shown to correlate well with elevated serum levels of chromogranin A (16). Elevated expression of GRP receptors are often detected
in CaP specimens (17, 18).
The bombesin/GRP family is among the most studied neuropeptide group in CaP. Bombesin/GRP transduces signals by
engaging heterotrimeric GPCRs located on the cell surface (19).
Upon binding to its receptors, bombesin/GRP elicits calcium
mobilization in PC-3 and DU 145 cells (20, 21), and promotes
growth and cell invasiveness via the proteolytic activities of matrix
metalloproteinases in LNCaP and PC-3 cells (15). We have
previously shown that exogenous bombesin/GRP activates AR
and supports androgen-independent growth in LNCaP through
signaling mediated by non–receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src,
FAK, and Etk (3). In vivo androgen withdrawal following the
establishment of LNCaP tumors results in an increased number
of neuroendocrine cells (5). Together, these data suggest that
castration-induced neuroendocrine differentiation may release
soluble factors which sustain the growth and survival of androgendeprived cells, contributing to tumor androgen-independence and
metastasis.
In this article, we describe a neuropeptide xenograft model and
use it to test the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase pathway
implicated in the development of androgen-independence. We
introduced the GRP-expressing vector into LNCaP cells to
establish an autocrine neuroendocrine model. The GRP clones
exhibited enhanced proliferation and migration properties under

Abstract
Treatment of advanced prostate cancer with androgen
deprivation therapy inevitably renders the tumors castration-resistant and incurable. Under these conditions, neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer (CaP) cells is
often detected and neuropeptides released by these cells
may facilitate the development of androgen independence.
Exemplified by gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), these neuropeptides transmit their signals through G protein–coupled
receptors, which are often overexpressed in prostate cancer,
and aberrantly activate androgen receptor (AR) in the absence
of androgen. We developed an autocrine neuropeptide model
by overexpressing GRP in LNCaP cells and the resultant cell
line, LNCaP-GRP, exhibited androgen-independent growth
with enhanced motility in vitro . When orthotopically
implanted in castrated nude mice, LNCaP-GRP produced
aggressive tumors, which express GRP, prostate-specific
antigen, and nuclear-localized AR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies of LNCaP-GRP clones suggest that GRP
activates and recruits AR to the cognate promoter in the
absence of androgen. A Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor,
AZD0530, inhibits androgen-independent growth and migration of the GRP-expressing cell lines, and blocks the nuclear
translocation of AR, indicating the involvement of SFK in the
aberrant activation of AR and demonstrating the potential use
of SFK inhibitor in the treatment of castration-resistant CaP.
In vivo studies have shown that AZD0530 profoundly inhibits
tumor metastasis in severe combined immunodeficient mice
implanted with GRP-autocrine LNCaP cells. This xenograft
model shows autocrine, neuropeptide- and Src kinase–
mediated progression of androgen-independent CaP postcastration, and is potentially useful for testing novel therapeutic
agents. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):151–60]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in
American men and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths
(1). Androgen withdrawal initially induces apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest in prostate cancer (CaP); however, CaP eventually loses
its dependence on androgens and progresses to an androgenindependent state. Various mechanisms have been postulated to

For inhibitor studies, 14 castrated SCID mice were orthotopically
implanted with 4  106 re-cultured GRP-Pro cells. SCID mice were used
to better study tumor metastasis. Two weeks after surgery, mice were
divided into two groups, seven were treated with 50 mg/kg/d via esophageal
gavaging (AZD0530-treated) and seven with buffer only (control). The study
was terminated when one of the control mice succumbed to tumor burden.
All the mice were euthanized, their primary tumors excised for weighing
and immunohistochemical staining with p-Src (Cell Signaling), p-FAK
(ABR), or AR antibodies and lymph nodes examined for metastasis.
Transient transfection assays. Zeo, GRP4-9, and GRP Pro cells were
seeded in 24-well plates, transfected with 0.2 Ag of PSA-Luc (promoter
region, 630 bp) with the internal control pTK-RL using Effectene (Qiagen).
Transactivation was examined by the dual-luciferase assay (Promega). For
RNA interference, standard siCONTROL (D-001210-02; SC) and on-target
plus SMART pool human Src (L-003175-00, SiSrc; Dharmacon) were
complexed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and delivered to cells
grown in CS medium at a final concentration of 100 nmol/L.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. LNCaP-Zeo, GRP, and GRP-Pro cells
grown to subconfluency were switched to CS medium for 3 days. Treatment
with R1881 was performed 6 h before harvesting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described (4, 25, 26) with 6 Ag of anti-AR
antibody (PG-21; Millipore). Standard PCR cycling protocol was performed
with 58jC for annealing for 30 cycles. Primers for AR enhancer region were
5¶catgttcacattagtacaccttg3¶ and 5¶tctcagatccaggcttgcttac3¶; for the proximal
ARE region, 5¶tcctgagtgctggtgtcttag3¶ and 5¶agccctataaaaccttcattcc3¶; and
for the intervening region, 5¶tcatccactcatcatccagcatc3¶ and 5¶ggagagcaatagacttgggaaacc3¶.
Immunofluorescent staining of AR. Cells (2,500) were plated in fourwell chamber slides in CS medium a day before fixing with 2%
paraformaldehyde for staining. Anti-AR (N-20; Santa Cruz) and anti-rabbit
AlexaFluor 647 (Invitrogen) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies for staining, respectively. Immunofluorescent cells were visualized
using an Olympus BX61 motorized reflected fluorescence microscope
system with an AMCA filter for 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and a Cy5
filter for AlexaFluor647 using the SlideBook4.1 software (Intelligent Imaging
Innovations).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot. LNCaP-Zeo, GRP, and GRPPro cells were subjected to androgen withdrawal for 3 days with or without
exposure to AZD0530 (1 Amol/L). Cell lysates were collected in
immunoprecipitation buffers containing proteinase and phosphatase
inhibitors, incubated with anti-FAK, and subsequently, protein G agarose
beads for immunoprecipitation. Phosphorylation of the respective precipitated proteins was detected by anti–p-Src family (Cell Signaling), p-FAK
(Invitrogen), and p-Etk (Cell Signaling) antibodies after Western blotting
analysis. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence system
(Amersham) followed by exposure to X-ray film.
Statistics. All in vitro data were from at least three independent
experiments and subjected to paired t tests using Statview program.

androgen-depleted conditions, and developed significant tumors
in castrated nude mice, providing evidence for GRP’s role in
androgen-independent growth through modulation of AR. We
tested the effect of a Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor AZD0530
on re-cultured xenograft cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our
results showed that AZD0530 effectively blocked the androgenindependent growth and migration of LNCaP cells mediated by
autocrine GRP, through inhibiting activation of the Src/FAK/
Etk complex. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice
implanted with GRP-autocrine LNCaP cells and treated with
AZD0530 showed a complete inhibition of tumor metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. LNCaP cells (American Type Culture Collection, passages
38–43) were kept in RPMI 1640 with 10% regular fetal bovine serum. When
stimulated, cells were switched to phenol red–free RPMI 1640 with 5%
charcoal-stripped (CS) androgen-free serum.
Proliferation assays. Cells were grown in CS medium alone or
supplemented with 100 nmol/L of bombesin, 1 Ag/mL of bombesin/GRPspecific monoclonal antibody 2A11 (22), 5 Amol/L of GRP receptor antagonist RC3095 (23), or transfection of 100 Amol/L of small inhibitory
RNA [siRNA, sense sequence GGAAACAGUUCAACACUCAUU, validated
by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for inhibition; Dharmacon] for GRP
receptor. Cells were tryspinized and counted by trypan blue exclusion
method after 48 h or over 6 days for siSrc transfection.
Chemotaxis migration assay. Migration assays were performed in a
Boyden chamber with 8 Am Nucleopore membrane coated with human
plasma fibronectin (50 Ag/mL). LNCaP cells (2  104) were placed in the
upper wells with testing agents in the lower wells, and incubated at 37jC
for 4 h to allow cell migration. At the end of incubation, the membrane
was stained by Diff-Quik Stain Kit and mounted on microscopic slides
for counting. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. AZD0530
(500 nmol/L) or siSrc transfection was used for inhibitor studies.
GRP-expressing construct and transfection. GRP cDNA was amplified
from the small cell lung carcinoma DMS53 cell line (American Type Culture
Collection), which expresses GRP. The amplified cDNA was inserted into
mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-Zeocin (Invitrogen). LNCaP cells
were transfected with this GRP construct or the empty vector and stable
transfectants were selected with Zeocin (100 Ag/mL) as GRP or Zeo (the
mock transfectant). The presence of the GRP gene in selected clones was
confirmed by Northern blotting and RT-PCR.
Quantitation of secreted GRP. Conditioned medium (CM) collected
from LNCaP, LNCaP-zeo, GRP1-1, GRP4-9, and DMS53 cells were concentrated by passing through PrepSep C18 reverse columns (Fisher) and the
retainee was eluted with an acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (59:40:1) mixture
(24). The reconstituted solvent-free eluents were assayed for bombesin/GRP
with a Bombesin EIA kit (Peninsula Lab).
Soft agar assay. Cells (2  104) were plated in the midst of 0.3% agar in
CS medium with or without 2A11 (1 Ag/mL). Colony formation was
examined after 4 weeks. For the re-cultured GRP xenograft, bicalutamide
(5 Amol/L) was used additionally.
In vivo tumor biology. Animal studies were conducted in accordance
with institutional ethical guidelines for the care and use of experimental
animals. Surgical castration was performed, and immediately following
castration, 2  106 LNCaP-Zeo and GRP cells co-suspended with 30%
Matrigel were injected orthotopically into 20 and 12 castrated nude mice,
respectively. At the end of 4 months, mice were sacrificed and their
prostates were collected for pathologic analyses. Tumor sections were
immunohistochemically stained with antibodies for GRP (RGG7130,
Peninsula Laboratories), AR (PG21, Millipore), and prostate-specific antigen
(PSA; ER-PR8, Dako) and detected using the DAKO Envision+ kit. PSA levels
were determined by the Micro PSA ELISA kit (Fitzgerald Industries).
Tumors were dissociated into singe-cell suspensions with collagenase
and plated in CS medium. The derived LNCaP GRP sublines, termed GRPPro (derived from prostate) were pooled together.

Results
It has been shown that bombesin confers androgen-independent
growth of LNCaP cells (3). We validated that bombesin signals
through the GRP receptor with specific inhibitors such as bombesin/GRP-specific monoclonal antibody 2A11 and GRP receptor
antagonist RC3940-II. Bombesin also stimulated cell migration as
compared with the negative control (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Expression of GRP enhances proliferation and migration of
transfected LNCaP cells. We established an autocrine model by
introducing a GRP overexpressing vector to androgen-sensitive
LNCaP cells to study the signaling pathways involved in androgen
independence in vitro and in vivo. Stable LNCaP-GRP transfectants
were established by overexpressing GRP cDNA and screened by
Northern blotting and RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Positive clones (e.g., GRP1-1
and GRP4-9) were isolated and characterized. Bombesin/GRP

and RT-PCR assays verified the expression of GRP gene into LNCaP GRP clones compared with the parental LNCaP/mock-transfected Zeo cells (negative controls)
and DMS53 (positive control) cells. B, quantitation of secreted GRP in CM collected from LNCaP, LNCaP-zeo, GRP1-1, GRP4-9, and small cell lung carcinoma

growth in CS medium with significance. D, Boyden chamber migration assay. Conditioned medium (CM ) was collected from cells by overlaying SF medium on
subconfluent plates for 48 h and the amount to use was normalized by the total protein concentration of each plate. CM from LNCaP-Zeo (Ctl CM ) or GRP (GRP CM )
cells were used as the chemoattractants. GRP-specific monoclonal antibody 2A11 (1 Ag/mL) was introduced as the inhibitor. Bombesin (100 nmol/L) was the
positive control. Migration assay was conducted as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, means from at least three independent experiments; bars, SE.

showed that LNCaP-GRP cells release GRP, which confers androgenindependent growth and migration through the autocrine loop.
GRP promotes in vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis in
androgen-free environments. Soft agar assay was performed to
assess in vitro tumorigenicity. GRP1-1 and GRP4-9 produced
significantly more colonies than LNCaP-Zeo in CS medium,
suggesting that the autocrine GRP induces both androgen- and
anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 2A). 2A11 significantly
inhibited colony formation of both GRP1-1 and GRP4-9 (P V 0.05
and P V 0.0005). We then used the GRP clones for in vivo tumor
study. Orthotopic prostatic implantation of GRP4-9 cells into
prostates of castrated nude mice resulted in tumor growth in 8 of
12 mice. In contrast, 0 of 20 castrated mice implanted with LNCaPzeo cells displayed any tumor growth. To generalize this finding,
GRP1-1 was also orthotopically implanted and four of five mice
produced tumors. H&E staining of the tumors showed characteristic human CaP tumors adjacent to normal mouse prostate tissue
(Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 2C) showed that
GRP was evident throughout the cytoplasm of the tumor regions,

enzyme immunoassay confirmed GRP expression in the two GRP
clones (Fig. 1B). GRP1-1 and GRP4-9 cells produce almost 5-fold
more GRP than the control lines, but comparable to DMS53 cells.
Antibody 2A11, GRP receptor antagonist RC3905, and siRNA for
the GRP receptor effectively inhibited the androgen-independent
growth of GRP1-1 and GRP4-9 to 20% to 60% of the control (Fig. 1C).
Negative control using siRNA targeting green fluorescence protein showed no effect on growth (data not shown). These data
support the notion that GRP/bombesin is able to confer androgenindependent growth of LNCaP through binding to its membrane
receptor. If the androgen-independent growth is due to the autocrine release of GRP into the medium, we would expect a chemotactic effect from GRP CM. As expected, LNCaP-Zeo migration was
stimulated by bombesin (Fig. 1D). GRP CM stimulated LNCaP-Zeo
migration by more than 3-fold and this migration was significantly
reduced by 2A11 (P V 0.001), suggesting GRP’s involvement.
Migration of GRP1-1 and GRP4-9 towards Ctl CM was 2-fold greater
than that of LNCaP-zeo, and could be further stimulated by GRP
CM, and significantly inhibited by 2A11 (P V 0.001). These data

GRP modulates the activation of AR. We further sought to
illustrate GRP-mediated AR activation at the molecular level.
Transactivation assay was performed with LNCaP-Zeo, GRP4-9,
and GRP-Pro cells in CS medium using promoter PSA-Luc as the
reporter. The expression of PSA-Luc in GRP4-9 and GRP-Pro was
1.8-fold and 4.5-fold higher than in LNCaP-Zeo cells (Fig. 3B). This
suggests that GRP secreted from GRP cells is driving the
expression. The addition of synthetic androgen R1881 induced
PSA-Luc expression in LNCaP-Zeo cells more than 6-fold, but much
less in GRP4-9 and GRP-Pro cells, probably because the GRPactivated AR, through posttranslational modification, already
adopted an active conformation and may not be further stimulated
by R1881. If GRP activates AR in GRP-Pro cells, AR should be
recruited to ARE sites in the PSA promoter. We therefore
performed the ChIP assay on LNCaP-Zeo, GRP4-9, and GRP-Pro
cells in CS or CS+R1881 conditions. AR binding was analyzed by
PCR using respective primers against enhancer (E) and proximal
(P) ARE regions, and an intervening (I) region void of any ARE sites.
Figure 3C shows that AR binds to PSA P region in GRP4-9 and GRPPro even in the absence of androgen. When treated with R1881, AR

yet was minimally detected in the normal mouse prostate
epithelium of the tumor. Staining with anti-AR antibody showed
its nuclear translocalization in tumor cells, indicative of GRP ligand
activation. PSA expression was extensive in the tumor specimens,
again supporting GRP-mediated AR activation. Mean serum PSA
levels in castrated LNCaP-GRP tumor mice was 208.9 F 24.6 ng/mL
serum, as compared with 6.13  10 5 ng/mL in castrated LNCaPzeo mice.
Tumors harvested from GRP-implanted mice were re-cultured
in vitro to establish a xenograft cell line, labeled GRP-Pro.
Expression of PSA, AR, and GRP in GRP-Pro cells was analyzed
by RT-PCR analysis for the authenticity of the clones (Supplementary Fig. S2). Equal endogenous levels of PSA mRNA for all
clones was also verified. Soft agar assay using GRP-Pro cells
showed their aggressive nature as manifested by their androgenand anchorage-independent growth in 2 weeks (Fig. 3A). This
growth was partially inhibited by 2A11 and the androgen inhibitor,
bicalutamide, individually or in combination (with significant
difference P V 0.05), suggesting that growth is dependent on both
GRP and AR.

tyrosine kinase shown to be involved in prostate carcinogenesis
(3, 29). Src and FAK form a complex through binding between the
phosphorylated Y397 in FAK and the SH2 domain in Src (30),
whereas FAK associates with Etk via the FERM domain of FAK and
the PH domain of Etk (31). These three kinases cross-activate one
another with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the complex.
Using AZD0530, we examined whether the androgen-independent
growth and migration stimulation observed in our autocrine model
was mediated through the Src/FAK signaling pathway. In LNCaP
cells, in addition to Src, another member of SFK, Lyn, is also
significantly expressed. We thus examined the phosphorylation
status of Src, Lyn, and FAK kinases in all cell lines grown in CS
medium. We immunoprecipitated Src and Lyn proteins with their
respective antibody then probed with anti–p-Src or anti–p-Y
antibodies. For FAK, we used anti–p-FAKY861, residue phosphorylated by Src as another indicator of SFK activity. All the GRP and
GRP-Pro lines displayed higher levels of kinase phosphorylations
compared with Zeo cells after exposure to CS serum for 3 days, and
the phosphorylations were inhibited by AZD0530 (Fig. 5A). The
data showed that (a) autocrine-GRP indeed activates the SFKs; and
(b) AZD0530, a pan-Src inhibitor, effectively blocks the activity of
Src family members. Thus, whereas in the ensuing studies we will
focus on the molecular characterizations of Src, the biological

binds preferentially to the E site in LNCaP-Zeo; whereas in GRP4-9
and GRP-Pro, AR binding was detected evenly at both P and E sites.
Src and FAK tyrosine kinases play important roles in GRPmediated androgen-independent growth and migration.
Exogenous bombesin induces AR nuclear translocation, and this
induction is inhibited by Src inhibitor PP2 (25). In our LNCaP GRP
mouse model, AR is localized to the nuclei as shown in the tumor
immunohistochemistry staining (Fig. 2C). We further compared the
GRP cells with mock controls by immunofluorescent staining to
confirm AR nuclear localization in GRP cells through autocrine
GRP-mediated activation (Fig. 4). Staining of AR is limited to the
cytoplasm in Zeo cells grown in CS medium but was concentrated
to the nuclei of GRP cells (counted 65% nuclei with AR). This
localization was inhibited by AZD0530, a selective SFK inhibitor
demonstrating significant effects on prostate cancer cells (27).
Almost half of the GRP cells (35% nuclei with AR remaining) lost
nuclear staining of AR when Src activity was inhibited. These data
confirm that GRP activates AR through Src and promotes its
nuclear translocation, consistent with recent data that Src directly
phosphorylates AR at Y534, resulting in nuclear translocation (28).
Among all the tyrosine kinases expressed in LNCaP cells, we
previously showed that Src and FAK are most prominently
activated by bombesin (3). Activated Src and FAK engage Etk, a

Knocking down Src with siSrc transfection into GRP4-9 and
GRP-Pro cells also reduced cell migration to comparable levels as
Zeo cells. These data support the notion that the GRP-mediated
androgen-independent growth and migration is principally through
SFKs, especially Src kinase.
SFK inhibitor AZD0530 prevents tumor metastasis in SCID
mice. With the encouraging results of AZD0530 inhibition in vitro,
we evaluated it in our orthotopic GRP mouse model. Fourteen
castrated SCID mice implanted with GRP-Pro cells; half of them
were administered 50 mg/kg/d of AZD0530 (treatment) beginning
2 weeks after surgery (to permit tumor establishment) and half
with buffer only (control) for 8 weeks. All control animals grew
tumors with lymph node metastasis (Fig. 6A). H&E staining (inset)
of the lymph node validated its human prostate cancer origin. Five
of seven treated animals produced primary tumors, but none had
metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining using anti–p-Src and
anti–p-FAK antibodies showed reduced phosphorylation levels in
the treatment samples (Fig. 6B), confirming the effect of AZD0530
in tumors. When probed with anti-AR antibody, the control tumor
showed AR nuclear localization as in Fig. 2C. AR staining became
undetectable in AZD0530-treated tumors because castrated
animals were used. As a result, PSA levels from the sera of
AZD0530-treated mice showed significant reduction (P = 0.02)
compared with controls (Fig. 6C). Primary tumor sizes in the
treated animals were smaller, although not statistically significant
(P = 0.104) when compared with control animals. AZD0530,

effects observed are likely due to the combined inhibition of all
SFKs expressed in LNCaP cells. We previously reported that when
activated, Src forms a complex with FAK and Etk, and that these
kinases cross-activate one another. Coimmunoprecipitation of Src,
FAK, and Etk kinases with the anti-FAK antibody confirms complex
formation and showed elevated activation of the three kinases in
GRP and GRP-Pro cells compared with Zeo cells. Treatment with
AZD0530 significantly reduced the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of all three kinases, and to a much lesser extent, the association between FAK and Src (Fig. 5A).
Regarding proliferation, AZD0530 reduced GRP-Pro cell growth
in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the anchorage- and
androgen-free growth of GRP-Pro cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). To
ensure that AZD0530 targets Src through which GRP mediates AR
activation, RNA interference experiments for Src (siSrc) were
performed. Transfection of siSrc into GRP4-9 and GRP-Pro cells
greatly impaired their ability to grow in CS medium compared with
their respective non-target controls (SC, scramble RNA); whereas
the LNCaP-Zeo cells did not grow well in androgen-deprived
conditions with or without siSrc (Fig. 5B). These data support Src
as a major target in neuropeptide-mediated AR activation, possibly
through its downstream kinases such as FAK and Etk. Both FAK
and Etk function in cell adhesion and migration, and inhibition of
Src would reduce LNCaP-GRP and GRP-Pro cell migration. As a

Neuropeptide Model for Androgen-Insensitive Prostate Cancer

Figure 5. A, effect of AZD0530 on Src/FAK/Etk complex. Phosphorylation status of Src, Lyn, and FAK kinases in LNCaP-zeo and GRP subclones (top ). Treatment
of all cells with 1 Amol/L of AZD0530 for 2 h diminishes kinase activations in all cells without affecting the total protein levels. Association of the Src/FAK/Etk
complex was illustrated by coimmunoprecipitation with the anti-FAK antibody. Cell lysates from Zeo and GRP cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody
and probed for p-Etk, p-FAK, total FAK p-Src, and total Src antibodies. Numbers under the untreated samples , the densitometric quantification for phosphorylation

validated the siSrc transfection. C, effect of AZD0530 and siSrc transfection on migration: AZD0530 (500 nmol/L) or knocking down Src kinase with siSrc inhibited

inhibitor AZD0530 completely blocks tumor metastasis in an
androgen-independent environment.
There are numerous reports on growth factors (32), cytokines,
chemokines (2, 4), and neuropeptides (3, 25) promoting the
androgen-independent growth of LNCaP cells. Although the ligands
inducing AR activation are different, many of them transmit
signals through the SFK (3, 4, 25). In the present model, we focused
on neuropeptides which are coupled to GPCRs and as we showed
previously, activate the tyrosine kinase complex Src/FAK/Etk (3).
We hypothesized that induced expression of GRP in LNCaP cells
may facilitate a more aggressive phenotype via autocrine stimulation. Our engineered LNCaP GRP cells showed androgen- and
anchorage-independent growth and superior migration compared
with control LNCaP-Zeo cells, and the bombesin/GRP-specific
antibody 2A11 partially inhibited the increased growth and migration. This incomplete inhibition by 2A11 may be due to the secretion of other neuropeptides such as neurotensin from the GRP
clones (data not shown). These other factors also activate GPCRs,
thus there is greater inhibition with GRP receptor inhibition
compared with 2A11. Consistent with the in vitro properties, autocrine GRP activity supports androgen-independent tumorigenesis

however, completely blocks tumor metastasis possibly through
inhibiting SFK and FAK.

Discussion
In this study, we report the development of a neuropeptideautocrine model for androgen-insensitive CaP. This model was not
designed to study neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, which
are relatively rare, but to study the effect of neuropeptides released
from neuroendocrine prostate cells on CaP progression following
androgen ablation. There is abundant literature documenting the
correlation of increased numbers of postmitotic neuroendocrine
cells with the development of castration-resistant CaP and reports
showing the overexpression of neuropeptides and neuropeptide
receptors in advanced CaP (16–18). Yet, the biological effect of
neuropeptides on CaP has not been clearly shown. We present
in vitro and in vivo data that the GRP autocrine loop is sufficient to
establish androgen independence in LNCaP cells by inappropriate
activation of AR. We also show that GRP activates Src, Lyn, FAK,
and Etk tyrosine kinases, which confer motility and invasiveness to
CaP. Our in vivo inhibitor study shows that administration of Src

activations. The exact mechanism of how bombesin/GRP activates
AR to induce androgen-independent growth of LNCaP is not fully
understood. Although GRP has been reported to mediate mitogenactivated protein kinase and Src activation through epidermal
growth factor receptor in some human malignancies (34), we
observed no increased tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal
growth factor receptors in LNCaP cells upon bombesin stimulation
(data not shown). Despite reports implicating Src kinase in the
development, growth, progression, and metastasis of human
cancers, only one report correlates elevated Src activation and
AR phosphorylation to hormone-refractory CaP (28). This report
elegantly showed that tyrosine residue Y534 of AR is the direct
target of Src phosphorylation, which effectively translocates AR
into the nucleus for gene transcription in the absence of androgen.
Another report relates the expression of a truncated c-kit tyrosine
kinase, which is a strong activator of Src, to advanced stages of CaP
(35), suggesting the importance of Src activity in CaP progression.
Here, we show that reversion of androgen-independent growth of
GRP lines by knocking out Src with siRNA supports a significant
role for Src in GRP-mediated cell proliferation. It is speculated that
modification of AR or its coactivators by phosphorylation (36) or
acetylation (37) mimics the conformational change caused by
androgen binding to activate AR in the absence of its cognate
ligand. Src may potentially phosphorylate AR directly or through an

of LNCaP-GRP clones in castrated mice. Immunohistochemical
staining showed nuclear localization of AR and PSA expression in
tumor cells, supporting GRP stimulation of AR in the absence of
testicular androgens, which is the sole source of androgen in mice.
These observations build on those reported by Burchardt and
colleagues, who showed that androgen withdrawal of established
in vivo LNCaP tumors resulted in the enrichment of neuroendocrine cells (5). Herein, we show that Src mediates the nuclear
translocation and target recruitment of AR induced by GRP, based
on in vitro (ChIP assay) and in vivo (tumor immunohistochemistry)
analyses. A related report using a neuroendocrine mouse prostate
allograft also showed that neuroendocrine secretions were sufficient to support androgen-independent growth of LNCaP and PSA
expression in vivo (33). These data together firmly establish the
potential of neuropeptides secreted by neuroendocrine-differentiated cells to induce androgen independence, and this process
involves Src activation.
Elevated tyrosine phosphorylations, especially Src activation,
were shown in hormone-refractory prostate cancer xenografts
derived from castrated animals (28). In this study, we showed that
Src (and likewise, Lyn) is activated both in the free form as well as
in the Src/FAK/Etk complex form. As expected, FAK and Etk are
also activated as indicated by their heightened phosphorylation
status. Impressively, AZD0530 treatment completely blocked these

autocrine model. Complex growth factors available in tumor
microenvironments and the compensatory pathways involving cell
proliferation downstream to Src may be factors why AZD0530
alone could not halt primary tumor growth. IC50’s for inhibiting
FAK, paxillin, and P130Cas responsible for migration were 4-fold to
64-fold lower than those for cyclin D1 and c-Myc for proliferation
(27). AZD0530 has been tested in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
cells to suppress tumor cell migration through modulating FAK
(47). Treating A549 lung carcinoma cells with AZD0530 results in
the down-regulation of Id1 gene expression, possibly through BMPSmad-Id pathway involved angiogenesis and metastasis (48). The
other small molecule Src inhibitor, dasatinib (49), displays an
inhibitory mechanism similar to AZD0530, with more inhibition on
metastasis than tumor growth in vivo (50). Lyn, a member of SFK,
found to play a role in PC-3 tumor progression, was also inhibited
by AZD0530 (data not shown).
In addition to neuropeptides, we have previously shown that Src
kinase activation is central to interleukin 8–induced androgenindependent prostate cell growth (4). Importantly, interleukin 8 is
also a ligand for GPCRs. As such, inhibition of signaling transduction through Src kinase as a downstream target may block
oncogenic stimulation for more than one ligand. The specific
mechanisms activating AR remain to be elucidated, but the pathways identified suggest that Src kinase inhibition may prove useful
in the treatment of androgen-independent CaP.

intermediate molecule (28). Yet, because no tyrosine-phosphorylated AR was detected in bombesin-treated LNCaP cells (25), the exact
mechanism of how Src is involved still remains to be elucidated. In
the ChIP assay, GRP mediated AR recruitment preferentially to the
proximal ARE site in the PSA promoter, rather than to the enhancer
ARE. This observation may reflect conformational modification of
AR by Src or a downstream kinase, which facilitates AR activation
by assembling a different coactivator complex to elicit gene
transactivation in the absence of its natural ligand. Similarly,
the reason why the addition of R1881 to GRP clone did not increase
the reporter activity further may be that GRP-activated AR is
already in active conformation and may not be further stimulated
by androgen. Our studies also revealed that posttranslationally
activated AR may be conformationally different from ligand-bound
AR, a finding supported by previous studies (4, 25). Further structural analysis will be required to substantiate this notion.
LNCaP cells are usually not very migratory, but overexpression
of GRP under androgen-free conditions enhances LNCaP-GRP cell
migration. Another reported mechanism is that bombesin activates
RhoA and Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase to
promote CaP cell migration and invasion (38). Because RhoA can
be activated by Etk (39), which is activated by Src (40), our data are
consistent with their findings. FAK phosphorylation in bombesinstimulated PC-3 cells is linked to cell motility and invasion (41). In
collaboration with FAK, Etk is also involved in integrin signaling
and promotes PC-3M migration (31). Knocking down Etk
expression with its specific siRNA inhibits LNCaP cell proliferation
(29, 42), and prostates from Etk transgenic mice exhibit pathologic
changes resembling human prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (29).
Complexing of these three kinases results in synergistic activation
and may transduce GRP-modulated signaling in CaP cell proliferation, migration, and survival.
Targeting the bombesin/GRP receptor for cancer therapy is
undergoing early clinical trials (43). Other clinical trials have
reported promising results using tyrosine kinase inhibitors in
cancer therapy; for instance, imatinib (Gleevec, STI571) for chronic
myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (44, 45)
and trastuzumab (Herceptin, Her-2 antibody) for breast cancer
(46). Our approach suggests using a SFK inhibitor to target the
activation of non–receptor tyrosine kinases. Through inhibiting
Src, AZD0530 prevents the Src-specific activation of FAK, AR, and
possibly, Etk and effectively blocks tumor metastasis in our GRP
