Abstract

Author Manuscript

Despite immense interest in employing antimalarials as autophagy inhibitors to treat cancer, it
remains unclear if these agents act predominantly via autophagy inhibition or whether other
pathways direct their anti-cancer properties. By comparing the treatment effects of the
antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and quinacrine (Q) on KRAS mutant lung cancer cells, we
demonstrate that inhibition of the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) is
required for antimalarial induced apoptosis. Despite inhibiting autophagy, neither CQ treatment
nor RNAi against autophagy regulators (ATGs) promote cell death. In contrast, Q triggers high
levels of apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo, and this phenotype requires both autophagy
inhibition and p53-dependent inhibition of the oxPPP. Simultaneous genetic targeting of the
oxPPP and autophagy is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung cancer cells, including cells lacking
p53. Thus, in addition to reduced autophagy, oxPPP inhibition serves as an important determinant
of antimalarial cytotoxicity in cancer cells.

supports that autophagy operates as a cell survival pathway in response to various microenvironmental stresses as well as promotes resistance to chemotherapy (2). As a result, there
is tremendous clinical interest in inhibiting autophagy as a potential strategy against cancers.
Importantly, antimalarials, namely chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),
inhibit lysosomal function and block the late stages of autophagic proteolysis. Given their
long history of clinical use as antimalarials and in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
these lysosomotrophic compounds have gained special attention for their potential utility as
pharmacological autophagy inhibitors in cancer (2, 3). Indeed, numerous clinical trials
utilizing HCQ in combination with cytotoxic and targeted therapies are under evaluation in
various cancers; the first of these studies indicate that HCQ can be successfully employed to
therapeutically inhibit autophagy in cancer patients with minimal dose-limiting toxicities (4–
10). Despite these initial positive results, much remains to learned about how antimalarials
like HCQ may be best exploited therapeutically against cancer. Notably, although the current
prevailing view is that the anti-cancer effects of HCQ predominantly arise from
macroautophagy inhibition, multiple preclinical studies suggest that the chemosensitizing
effects of this lysosotrophic agent may not be entirely autophagy-dependent (11, 12). Hence,
further elucidating the pathways by which antimalarials target cancer cells remains a subject
of immense therapeutic significance.

Author Manuscript

Similar to CQ and HCQ, the antimalarial quinacrine (Q) exhibits anti-cancer properties and
has been demonstrated to function as a late-stage autophagy inhibitor (13–16). Remarkably,
in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), we previously found that Q was significantly
more potent than CQ in inducing the apoptosis of cancer cells, both as a single agent and in
combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (16). Moreover, others have reported
that Q is more potent than CQ in killing glioblastoma multiforme cells (17). Accordingly, by
scrutinizing the phenotypic differences between these two FDA-approved agents, we sought
to further mechanistically understand how these antimalarials promote cancer cell death.
Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway
(oxPPP) is required to induce apoptosis in KRAS mutant lung cancer cells in response to
antimalarial treatment.

RESULTS
Quinacrine (Q) promotes apoptosis of NSCLC cells independently of autophagy
inhibition

Author Manuscript

We focused on KRAS mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells because
previous studies indicate that genetic autophagy inhibition impairs the proliferation of RAStransformed cells, while modestly impacting cell death (18–22). Treatment of KRAS mutant
A549 and H460 NSCLC cells (both p53 wild type, Supplementary Fig. 1A) with either CQ
or Q led to the dose-dependent accumulation of phosphotidylethanolamine lipidated LC3
(LC3-II), consistent with impaired autophagic flux. Neither of these antimalarials inhibited
the levels of ERK/MAPK phosphorylation, indicating that key mitogenic signals
downstream of oncogenic Ras activation remained intact (Fig. 1A). Similar to CQ, Q
suppressed the proliferative outgrowth of both A549 and H460 cells (Fig. 1B, C). Stable
depletion of the essential autophagy regulator ATG7 also reduced autophagosome formation

(LC3-II) and proliferative expansion (Fig. 1D), thereby confirming previous studies from our
lab and others that genetic autophagy inhibition suppresses KRAS mutant cancer cell
proliferation (18–21).
On the other hand, Q was unique in its ability to induce cell death in both A549 and H460
cells. Upon 24h of Q treatment, NSCLC cells exhibited a 35–45% reduction in cell viability
(Fig. 1E–F). We confirmed that Q induced apoptosis in both lines, evidenced by increased
levels of caspase-3 cleaved PARP and cleaved cytokeratin 18 fragments, both of which are
specifically produced during apoptotic cell death. In contrast, CQ treatment did not
significantly impact cell survival or induce apoptosis at doses robustly blocking autophagic
flux (Fig. 1E–F). Similar to CQ, both ATG7 and ATG12 knockdown had minimal effects on
KRAS mutant NSCLC cell survival (Supplementary Fig. 1B–F).

To assay whether Q triggered tumor cell death in vivo, we compared the effects of CQ and Q
treatment on NSCLC xenografts. Both CQ and Q blocked the late stages of autophagy,
evidenced by increased numbers of autophagosomes (punctate LC3) and p62 (SQSTM1)
aggregates, both of which accumulate upon antimalarial inhibition of autophagy (Fig. 2A)
(1, 23). Notably, in A549 xenografts, we also observed increased necrosis following 14 days
of Q treatment compared to control or CQ treated tumors (Fig. 2B). Consistent with our in
vitro studies, both CQ and Q suppressed proliferation, evidenced by a decrease in tumor
cells positive for the mitosis marker, phospho-histone H3 (pHH3). However, only Q
treatment promoted apoptosis in A549 xenografts, evidenced by increased cleaved caspase-3
(CC3) positive tumor cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, Q treated animals exhibited reduced
tumor volumes and weights, compared to those treated with vehicle (CNT) and CQ,
although these reductions were not statistically significant over 21 days of treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). Similarly, both CQ and Q reduced proliferation in H460
xenografts, whereas Q uniquely induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 2B–D). Finally, in
contrast to the tumor xenografts, we did not observe detectable apoptosis in several normal
tissues from CQ and Q treated animals, evidenced by the lack of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and CC3 staining (Supplementary Fig. 2E).
Overall, these results indicate that Q is selectively cytotoxic for tumors compared to normal
tissues; furthermore, the death-inducing effects of Q in NSCLC cells are mediated, at least in
part, by targeting pathways other than autophagy.
Oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway (oxPPP) inhibition is required for antimalarials to
induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells

Author Manuscript

In parallel, we evaluated the effects of CQ and Q on glucose metabolism, motivated by our
previous work demonstrating that genetic ATG deficiency impairs glucose uptake and
glycolytic flux in RAS-transformed fibroblasts and breast cancer cells (20). Using 13C-NMR
to measure [3-13C]-lactate produced from [1-13C]-glucose, we unexpectedly observed that Q
treatment significantly impaired glycolytic flux in A549 and H460 cells, whereas CQ
treatment did not (Fig. 3A). To extend these results, we measured how antimalarials
regulated the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), a side-branch of
glycolysis implicated in biosynthesis, antioxidant response and cell survival (24). In contrast
to CQ, Q potently inhibited the oxPPP (Fig. 3B) and attenuated the enzymatic activity of

glucose-6-phosphase dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting step of the oxPPP (Fig. 3C).
We next interrogated the functional importance of oxPPP inhibition in mediating NSCLC
cell death during antimalarial treatment. Treatment of A549 and H460 cells with the
pharmacological oxPPP inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN), induced mild cell death as a
single agent. However, upon combining 6-AN with CQ, clonogenic recovery was profoundly
reduced and apoptotic PARP cleavage was increased to levels comparable to that achieved
with Q (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, upon RNAi-mediated G6PD depletion, CQ treatment was
able to induce cell death in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells (Fig. 3E–F). Because these deathpromoting effects of G6PD depletion or pharmacological inhibition were only observed
upon CQ treatment, we tested whether the simultaneous inhibition of oxPPP and autophagy
was sufficient to promote cell death. Indeed, the combined knockdown of ATG7 and G6PD
abrogated cell survival and increased apoptotic PARP cleavage in A549 and H460 cells (Fig.
3G and Supplementary Fig. 3A–B). We propose that this unique convergence of events upon
treatment with Q, but not with CQ, mediates the ability to induce cell death in KRAS mutant
NSCLC cells.
Autophagy and the oxPPP each serve distinct functions in mitigating reactive oxygen
species (ROS) in cells (21, 25). Thus, we asked how the combined effects of Q on autophagy
deficiency and PPP inhibition modulated ROS. Q treatment led to more pronounced levels of
ROS in both A549 and H460 cells compared to control and CQ-treated cells (Fig. 4A–B).
Moreover, Q-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated upon co-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC) (Fig. 4C–D). These results corroborate that increased
oxidative stress, which we propose to be secondary to the combined inhibition of autophagy
and oxPPP, is an important contributor to Q-mediated cytotoxicity in KRAS mutant NSCLC
cells.

p53 induction is required for NSCLC cell death in response to antimalarial treatment

Author Manuscript

Previous studies indicate CQ and Q can activate the p53 tumor suppressor pathway via
diverse mechanisms (13–15, 26, 27). Indeed, Q treatment led to robust p53 induction in
A549 and H460 cells in vitro (Fig. 5A–B) and increased numbers of p53 positive cells were
evident in Q-treated A549 and H460 xenografts in vivo (Fig. 5C–D). In contrast, CQ failed
to significantly induce p53 in either cell type in vitro or in vivo (Fig 5A–D). To ascertain the
functional significance of p53 induction downstream of Q treatment, we interrogated the
effects of antimalarials on the p53 null, KRAS mutant NSCLC cell line, H358
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). Importantly, CQ and Q blocked autophagic flux in H358 similarly
to p53 wild type NSCLC cells (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. 4A) and suppressed
proliferative outgrowth in vitro (Fig. 5F). Moreover, Q treatment attenuated mitotic activity
(pHH3) in H358 xenografts (Fig. 5G). Thus, the autophagy-inhibitory and anti-proliferative
effects of CQ and Q were not p53 dependent. On the other hand, H358 cells were highly
resistant to Q-induced cell death both in vivo (Fig. 5G) as well as in vitro (Fig. 4H).
Furthermore, the stable shRNA-mediated depletion of p53 in A549 and H460 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4B–C) significantly reversed Q-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5H).

Combined inhibition of oxPPP and autophagy is sufficient to elicit lung cancer cell death
irrespective of p53 status

Author Manuscript

The tumor suppressor p53 has emerged as an important regulator of glucose metabolism
(28). Intriguingly, recent studies demonstrate that p53 inhibits oxPPP flux by directly
binding and inhibiting G6PD (29). Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed a
physical interaction between G6PD and p53 upon Q treatment of NSCLC cells (Fig. 6A).
Furthermore, similar to CQ, Q failed to significantly inhibit the oxPPP in H358 cells (Fig.
6B). Remarkably, we did note that Q treatment slightly reduced G6PD activity in these cells
(Fig. 6C), suggesting factors other than p53 status may influence Q inhibition of G6PD
enzymatic activity. Nonetheless, our results indicated that Q-induced cell death and overall
oxPPP inhibition in NSCLC cells were both p53 dependent. Since p53 can mediate multiple
pro-apoptotic pathways (28), we evaluated the specific requirement of oxPPP inhibition
downstream of p53 by testing whether G6PD knockdown was sufficient to promote
antimalarial cytotoxicity in p53-deficient cells. Indeed, G6PD knockdown in H358 cells
diminished cell survival and increased apoptotic PARP cleavage following CQ or Q
treatment (Fig. 6D–E and Supplementary Fig. 5A). Finally, we tested the effects of
combined knockdown of G6PD and ATG7 on the viability of H358 cells. Indeed, despite the
absence of p53, the concomitant genetic inhibition of oxPPP and autophagy was sufficient to
promote the death of H358 cells (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. 5B–C). Thus, the
simultaneous genetic targeting of autophagy and the oxPPP was sufficient to trigger
apoptosis in lung cancer cells, irrespective of p53 status.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

Currently, there is immense interest in repurposing antimalarials as autophagy inhibitors to
treat cancer (2, 3). Here, by evaluating the treatment effects of chloroquine (CQ) and
quinacrine (Q), we provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumorigenic
properties of these two FDA-approved antimalarial lysosomotrophic agents. First, our results
suggest that the ability of antimalarials to suppress proliferation in KRAS mutant lung
cancer cells is at least partly due to autophagy inhibition, because genetic autophagy
deficiency achieved via ATG knockdown elicits analogous anti-proliferative effects. On the
other hand, autophagy inhibition in itself does not promote significant apoptosis in KRAS
mutant NSCLC cells. Rather, inhibition of the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate
pathway (oxPPP) cooperates with autophagy inhibition to promote antimalarial cytotoxicity
in these cells. In addition, using genetic loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that
the simultaneous targeting of autophagy and the oxPPP is needed to efficiently trigger the
apoptosis of these lung cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

In contrast to our studies, others have found that autophagy inhibition by itself is sufficient
to elicit cancer cell death. For example, the basal breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-468
undergoes robust cell death in response to CQ treatment or ATG knockdown and murine
KRAS mutant lung cancers exhibit apoptosis and regression in response to acute ATG7
deletion in vivo (30, 31). These studies indicate that the cooperation that we have observed
between autophagy and oxPPP inhibition during Q treatment may be context-specific.
However, since the status of the oxPPP was not specifically examined in these studies, it

remains uncertain whether alterations in glucose metabolism or other metabolic
susceptibilities predispose these tumors to the death-promoting effects of autophagy
inhibition. Nonetheless, our results indicate that co-targeting the oxPPP may represent a
valuable strategy to promote the apoptosis of cancer cells that do not robustly respond to
autophagy inhibition alone.

To most effectively scrutinize mechanisms underlying cell death, we have employed
antimalarials as single agents in this study. In reality, these agents are most commonly being
repurposed as chemosensitizers in combination with other therapies; in fact, abundant work
in preclinical models supports the rationale for targeting autophagy as a combination
strategy in multiple tumor types and in response to diverse chemotherapeutic agents (2, 3).
Moreover, the first early phase clinical trials utilizing HCQ in combination with anticancer
therapies have recently been reported in humans; although clinical efficacy was not the
primary endpoint of these initial phase I or I/II studies, it is noteworthy that remarkable
clinical responses were observed in certain patients with refractory tumors(4–10). Moreover,
a 100% clinical response rate and over 70% complete remission rate was observed in dogs
with naturally occurring lymphoma following treatment with doxorubicin combined with
HCQ (4). Given the initial optimism from these clinical trials, a more complete
understanding of the mechanisms by which antimalarials induce tumor cell death is crucial
for the development of future therapeutic strategies employing these agents. Based on our
findings, we hypothesize that CQ or Q will most effectively induce cancer cell apoptosis
when combined with a second treatment modality targeting the oxPPP. Although doselimiting limiting toxicities may hamper direct targeting of the oxPPP in cancer patients,
several currently utilized clinical agents are known to suppress glucose metabolism.
Accordingly, one can predict that such agents, due to the resulting decline in oxPPP activity,
will similarly cooperate with autophagy inhibitors in promoting cell death. Indeed, support
for this concept comes from our previous studies in GIST; because the tyrosine kinase
inhibitor imatinib potently inhibits glucose uptake and glycolytic metabolism in GIST cells,
inhibiting autophagy via ATG knockdown or antimalarials potently synergizes with imatinib
to trigger apoptosis and prevent the development of acquired resistance in GIST (16).

Author Manuscript

We also demonstrate that the dual blockade of autophagy and oxPPP promotes cytotoxicity
regardless of p53 status. These findings may be of particular importance in the treatment of
NSCLC and pancreatic ductal carcinomas (PDAC), two highly lethal cancers that commonly
harbor oncogenic KRAS mutations in combination with the loss or mutation of p53.
Notably, studies in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer
have revealed complex interconnections between autophagy and p53 in PDAC progression
and tumor metabolism(32, 33). When p53 inactivation occurs by somatic loss of
heterozygosity (LOH), autophagy inhibition impairs KRAS driven PDAC progression;
moreover, CQ leads to mitochondrial respiration defects(33). On the other hand, upon
embryonic deletion of p53 in the pancreas, autophagy inhibition via genetic ATG7 deletion
or HCQ treatment unexpectedly accelerates the onset of PDAC; remarkably, cells isolated
from these rapidly growing tumors exhibit increased levels of both glycolytic and oxPPP
intermediates(32). These results broach the possibility that oxPPP inhibition may be
exploited to promote tumor cell death and prevent carcinoma progression in certain PDACs
lacking both autophagy and p53.

Finally, as clinical trials go forward, an important challenge is identifying useful biomarkers
and surrogates to predict antimalarial response against tumors, especially in the advent of
new divalent CQ derivatives, such as Ly-05 (34). Our results suggest that the oxPPP activity
may serve as one useful monitor of response in therapeutic regimens employing
antimalarials. Overall, they highlight the importance of identifying and scrutinizing other
biological parameters, not just autophagy inhibition, to more effectively evaluate the utility
of antimalarials in the clinical oncology setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

The NSCLC lines A549, H460 and H358 were acquired from the American Type Culture
Collection and passaged for less than 6 months following resuscitation; cell lines were not
authenticated or tested for Mycoplasma contamination. A549 cells were grown in DMEM
containing 25 mm glucose (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. H460 and H358 were cultured in
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Chloroquine (CQ)
and quinacrine (Q) were dissolved in water and cells were treated at the indicated doses.
Because Q treatment of cells elicits high levels of autofluorescence, the analysis of cultured
cells via fluorescence-based activity assays was not technically feasible. N-acetyl Cysteine
(NAC) was dissolved directly into tissue culture media at a final concentration of 5 μM and
pH was readjusted to 7.4 prior to use.

pLKO.1 lentiviral expression plasmids containing shRNAs against ATG7 and ATG12 were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Mission shRNA) and shRNA against p53 was purchased
from Addgene (plasmid 19119). Viral particles were produced using a third-generation
lentiviral packaging system in HEK293T cells. Following infection and drug selection, early
passage stable pools of ATG knockdown cells (maximum of 5 passages) were utilized
because extended propagation results in the loss of RNAi-mediated silencing and autophagy

Cell proliferation, cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays

Author Manuscript

For growth curves, 1 × 104 cells were grown in triplicate in the presence of the indicated
treatments. Cells were harvested, stained with trypan blue and live cells were enumerated
using a hemocytometer at the indicated timepoints. For studies of cell death, trypan blue
exclusion was utilized to quantify cell viability because Q treatment elicits high autofluorescence in cells, which precludes the use of fluorescent-based cell death assays. The
caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18 (cCK18) M30 fragment was measured using the M30
Cytodeath ELISA (Diapharma P10900), according to the manufacturer’s protocol; this assay
quantitatively measures a stable apoptosis-generated neoepitope in CK-18 (Asp396). Levels
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using the ROS-Glo H2O2 luminescence kit
(Promega G8820) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Immunoblotting

Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer plus 10 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM
Na3VO3, 10 nM calyculin A, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by
centrifugation for 15 min at 4°C, and protein concentrations were assessed using a
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo, Waltham, MA). Samples containing equal
amounts of protein were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved using SDS–PAGE, and
transferred to poly-vinylidene diflouride membrane. Membranes were blocked in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) + 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with the

Cells were grown in DMEM medium containing 25 mmol/L of [1-13C] glucose to 80%
confluency, upon which medium was collected for NMR analysis and cells were harvested
for protein quantification using the BCA assay. Briefly, medium was lyophilized and
reconstituted in 1mL of deuterium oxide. To acquire 13C spectra, the reconstituted sample
was acquired on a 600-MHz INOVA spectrometer (Varian; Palo Alto, CA) using a 30° flip
angle, 3.5-s repetition time, and broadband proton decoupling. Analysis of the NMR spectra
was performed using Bruker Topspin software version 3.0 (Bruker Biospin GmbH,
Germany). The concentrations of metabolites were determined with respect to an external
reference, 2,2,3,3-tetradeutero-3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid (TSP), with a known

One million cells were plated onto 10 cm dishes in triplicate, grown overnight and treated
with vehicle control (water) or with CQ or Q at the indicated doses for 3h at 37C. Cells were
washed twice with PBS and the tissue culture media was replaced with media containing
0.8μCi of 1-14C-glucose (Perkin Elmer) or 6-14C-glucose containing vehicle (water) or the
indicated antimalarial; cells were incubated for an additional 7h prior to analysis. To capture
gaseous 14CO2, Whatman filter paper was taped to the inside of culture dish lid and the plate
was then sealed with Parafilm; the experiment was terminated by adding 500μL of
perchloric acid to the cells; the plate was resealed and left in the incubator overnight. Filter
papers were then carefully removed and placed into vials containing Ready-Safe Liquid
Scintillation Fluid (Beckman Coulter), and 14CO2 activity was measured on a Beckman
LS6000 Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. The incubation of cells with 6-14C-glucose, used to
correct for 14CO2 production from the citric acid cycle, yielded minimal 14CO2 activity.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity assay
G6PD activity was determined using the G6PD activity assay kit from Biovision (Milpitas,

or 10 × 106 (H358) cells in a 1:1 dilution of Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences). Tumors were
grown to 0.5 cm (maximal dimension) and animals were randomized prior to starting
antimalarial treatment. Mice were randomized to receive CQ, Q or vehicle (water) daily. CQ
was administered at 60 mg/kg via intraperitoneal (IP) injection, Q at 50 mg/kg by oral
gavage and vehicle (water) by oral gavage as previously described (16). Tumors were
evaluated for autophagosome (punctate LC3) and p62/SQSTM accumulation, apoptosis and
proliferation following 14 days of treatment. For quantification of imaging data from tissue
sections, 10 fields were randomly chosen prior to quantification. Analysis of tumor growth
in tumor-bearing mice treated with CQ, Q or vehicle (water) was performed in parallel; the
dimensions of tumors were measured using calipers, and tumor volume was calculated using
the formula: (length × width2)/2. Following 21 days of treatment, mice were euthanized and
individual tumors were weighed. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample
size, and no data were excluded.
Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

Each experiment was repeated at least three independent times and no data were excluded
for analysis. GraphPad Prism software (v5.0b) was used for generation of graphs and
statistical analysis. P values were determined by Student’s t-test for pair-wise comparisons
or by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD for multiple comparisons as indicated. For
statistical comparisons, all data exhibited a normal distribution and the variance between
groups was similar.
