BACKGROUND. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carries a dismal prognosis in older
patients. In this study, the authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of arsenic trioxide combined with low-dose cytarabine in untreated patients aged 60 years
with AML.

METHODS. In a phase 1/2 design, arsenic trioxide was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg on Days 1 through 5 and on Days 8 through
12, and low-dose cytarabine was given subcutaneously twice daily on Days 1
through 14 in escalating doses to a target of 10 mg/m2 per dose. Of 64
patients who had pathologically confirmed AML, excluding patients with acute
promyelocytic leukemia and using World Health Organization criteria, the median age was 71 years, 10 patients (16%) had treatment-related AML, 40
patients (63%) had an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disorder, and 35 patients (55%) had unfavorable cytogenetics. Thirty-four

RESULTS. Complete remission was achieved in 21 of 61 patients (34%), including

CONCLUSIONS. The addition of arsenic trioxide to low-dose cytarabine appeared
to improve responses in elderly patients who had AML compared with either
agent alone, and a randomized trial of the combination versus single-agent lowdose cytarabine is ongoing. Cancer 2008;113:2504–11.  2008 American Cancer

A

cute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a poor prognosis in patients
aged >60 years. Cytarabine and anthracycline combinations
remain the cornerstone of therapy and produce remission in up to
60% of older patients with de novo disease, excellent performance
status, and no major comorbidities.1,2 However, even in this highly
selected group, the majority of patients develop disease recurrence
and die of their disease or associated complications, and the median
survival is from 6 to 12 months. For most patients aged >60 years,
conventional chemotherapy induction carries unacceptably high

morbidity and mortality with little expectation of
durable remission. The statistics are particularly grim
in older patients who have adverse prognostic indicators, such as unfavorable cytogenetics, antecedent
hematologic disorders, and/or poor performance status, all of which frequently are identified. In these
patients, remission rates with standard induction fall
and early deaths increase, causing many clinicians
and investigators not to offer intensive chemotherapy
at all.3 As the median age at diagnosis for AML is
approximately 65 years, new treatment options are
clearly needed.
Subcutaneously administered, low-dose cytarabine has been used as a lower intensity AML treatment for more than 25 years. Rates of complete
remission (CR) are between 15% and 25%, and some
patients may achieve improved hematologic parameters.4-6 The regimen generally is well-tolerated and
often can be administered on an outpatient basis.
The United Kingdom Medical Research Council
recently completed a trial comparing low-dose
cytarabine administered at 20 mg twice daily for
10 days every 4 to 6 weeks with hydroxyurea for
older patients who were not ‘fit’ for chemotherapy.6
Among 217 patients, 18% achieved CR with a median
duration of 80 weeks. Both the remission rate and overall survival improved significantly with low-dose cytarabine compared to hydroxyurea/supportive care.
In an effort to improve these results, we combined
low-dose cytarabine with arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide is highly effective in recurrent and newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia and produces
modest responses in myelodysplastic syndrome.7,8
Although no responses were observed in a small study
of single-agent arsenic trioxide in patients with AML,9
in vitro and clinical data suggest synergy of arsenic trioxide with ascorbic acid, and there has been activity,
including CR, in a few older patients with AML who
were treated with arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid.10
In addition, in vitro data demonstrate that arsenic trioxide has antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on a
variety of AML cell lines.11 Arsenic trioxide has several
mechanisms of action with potential importance in
AML, including induction of cell death through cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy; generation of
reactive oxygen species and accumulation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide; release of cytochrome c and
activation of caspases; inhibition of glutathione peroxidase; and promotion of differentiation and antiangiogenesis.12-14 We hypothesized that arsenic trioxide
may augment the clinical activity of low-dose cytarabine in older patients with AML and conducted a
phase 1/2 study to determine the safety and efficacy
of this combination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Patients aged 60 years with previously untreated
AML (defined according to World Health Organization guidelines) were eligible for study participation
if they met the following criteria: 1) serum creatinine
2.5 times the upper limit of normal; 2) serum bilirubin  upper limit of normal; 3) absence of t(8;21)
and inv(16) cytogenetic abnormalities, unless the
patient could not or would not tolerate conventional
chemotherapy; 4) absence of t(15;17); 5) absence of
uncontrolled cardiac or pulmonary disease; and 6)
baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) with a heartratecorrected QT interval (QTc) <500 msec. Prior therapy
with hydroxyurea, 5’-azacytidine, and hematopoietic
cytokines for myelodysplastic syndrome was permitted, but prior cytotoxic therapy for AML was not.
Approval for the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Weill Medical College of Cornell University and the New York Presbyterian
Hospital, and all study participants provided witnessed, written informed consent. The study was
conducted in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Treatment Schedule
Arsenic trioxide (Trisenox; Cephalon, Inc.) was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion at a dose
of 0.25 mg/kg on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8
through 12. Serum potassium and magnesium levels
were required to be 4 mEq/dL and 2 mg/dL,
respectively, before each arsenic trioxide administration. ECGs were obtained at baseline and at least
twice weekly during arsenic trioxide treatment. Early
in the study, if the QTc was 500 msec, then arsenic
trioxide was held, electrolytes were repleted, and
concomitant medications were altered when possible
to reduce the QTc. Arsenic trioxide was administered
only when the QTc was <500 msec. If doses were
missed, they were replaced at the end of the treatment cycle when possible. On the basis of published
data, the protocol subsequently was amended such
that the QT interval, rather than the QTc interval,
was required to be <500 msec before arsenic trioxide
administration.15
Low-dose cytarabine at a dose of 5 mg/m2,
7.5 mg/m2, or 10 mg/m2 was given subcutaneously
twice daily on Days 1 through 14 (1 treatment cycle).
Bone marrow aspiration was performed on Day 21. If
the bone marrow was hypocellular and without evidence of residual disease, then the patient was given
antimicrobials, transfusions of blood products,
and other supportive interventions as needed until

2506

peripheral count recovery, when another bone marrow biopsy/aspiration were performed to assess
response. Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor was
permitted at the discretion of the principal investigator.
If the Day-21 bone marrow showed residual disease,
then the patient was given a second treatment cycle
with the addition of 1 g of ascorbic acid intravenously
over 30 minutes within 30 minutes of arsenic trioxide.
Patients could receive additional treatment cycles if
clinical benefit was demonstrated.
For patients in CR, an additional, identical consolidation cycle was given within 4 weeks of count
recovery. If the patient required 2 cycles of treatment
to achieve CR, then the consolidation was identical
to the second treatment cycle (ie, it included ascorbic acid). Responding patients who were unable or
unwilling to undergo reduced-intensity allogeneic
stem cell transplantation were offered monthly maintenance therapy with low-dose cytarabine at a dose
of 10 mg/m2 subcutaneously twice daily on Days 1
through 5 and arsenic trioxide at a dose of 0.25 mg/
kg intravenously on Days 1 and 4. Patients who
received ascorbic acid during induction and consolidation also received it with the arsenic trioxide infusions as part of maintenance. Recovery of baseline
hematopoiesis was required for each maintenance
cycle. Supportive measures for optimal care were
provided throughout all treatment cycles. Treatment
was administered on an outpatient basis when clinically and logistically feasible.

Response Criteria
CR was defined as trilineage maturation, absent Auer
rods, 5% bone marrow blasts, resolution of extramedullary disease, and restoration of normal hematopoiesis with an absolute neutrophil count 1 3
109/L and a platelet count 100 3 109/L. No
response was defined as the failure to achieve CR
but without disease progression. Treatment failure/
progression of disease was defined either as failure
to achieve >50% reduction in blasts compared with
baseline or as death from any cause. Induction mortality was death within 30 days of the initiation of
treatment.
Statistical Analysis
This was a phase 1/2 study of the combination of arsenic trioxide with low-dose cytarabine in patients
aged 60 years with previously untreated AML and
in untreated patients with intermediate-2 or highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome according to the
International Prognostic Scoring System. To our
knowledge, this was the first study of this regimen.

The AML and myelodysplastic syndrome study
cohorts accrued separately and in parallel following a
modified Fibonacci schema; the myelodysplastic syndrome data will be reported separately. Low-dose
cytarabine was administered at the same schedule in
3 dosing cohorts, 5 mg/m2, 7.5 mg/m2, and 10 mg/
m2, with the latter target dose based on published
data. Arsenic trioxide was administered at a fixed
dose of 0.25 mg/kg on the basis of previously published safety and efficacy data in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.7,8 Other endpoints were CR
and induction mortality.
Phase 2 sample size for the AML cohort was
determined according to the Simon 2-stage optimal
design.16 On the basis of published data, the predicted response rate to single-agent, low-dose cytarabine was 18%.6 Thus, a response rate 18% was
considered unacceptable for the current study, and
an overall response proportion 30% was considered
worthy of further exploration. The null hypothesis
that the overall response proportion was 18% was
tested against the alternative hypothesis that the
response proportion was 30%. Sample size computations were performed assuming a 5% level of significance and 80% power. In the first stage,
40 patients would enter the study. If 7 patients
responded, then the study would be terminated early,
and the results would be categorized as negative. If
8 patients responded, then enrollment would be
extended to 77 patients at most for stage 2, and the
results would be declared effective and worthy of further testing if 20 patients responded. This 2-stage
design would yield a 0.8 probability of a positive
result if the true percentage of overall responders
was 30%. It would yield a 0.95 probability of a
negative result if the true percentage of overall
responders was 18%.
Overall survival was analyzed using the KaplanMeier method, and 95% confidence intervals were
constructed using the Greenwood formula. Median
follow-up for the cohort was computed from the
patients who remained alive. All P values are 2-sided,
and statistical significance was evaluated at the .05 a
level. All analyses were performed using SAS version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata version
8.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex) statistical
software.

RESULTS
Sixty-four patients with untreated AML were enrolled.
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
The median age of the study group was 71 years
(range, 54-85 years) and 44% of patients were men.

ECOG indicates Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.
*Includes antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative disorder (31 patients), myelofibrosis (4 patients), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (6 patients), and 1 patient with both myelofibrosis and myeloproliferative disorder.

One man aged 54 years who had medical comorbidities that precluded conventional induction was treated. The estimated Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status was estimated at 0 in
4 patients (6%), 1 in 26 patients (41%), 2 in 25 patients
(39%), and 3 in 9 patients (14%). Ten patients (16%)
had treatment-related AML after chemotherapy with
or without radiotherapy for another malignancy, and
40 patients (63%) had secondary AML after an antecedent hematologic disorder (eg, myelodysplastic
syndrome or myeloproliferative disease). The baseline karyotype was obtained on all patients: Thirtyfive patients (55%) had unfavorable cytogenetics
(25/5q2, 27/7q2, t(6;9), t(9;22), and abnormal 3q,
9q, 11q, 20q, 21q, 17p, complex), 26 patients (41%)
had intermediate cytogenetics (diploid, 18, 2Y, and
all other unclassified), and 3 patients (5%) had secondary inv16.
Sixty-one patients (95%) were treated at the second-phase target dose of 10 mg/m2 low-dose cytarabine twice daily on Days 1 through 14. The median

2507

age was 72 years (range, 54-85 years), 26 patients
(43%) were men, 11 patients (18%) had secondary
AML, and 34 patients (56%) had an antecedent hematologic disorder. Thirty-three patients (54%) with
unfavorable cytogenetics, 25 patients (41%) with intermediate cytogenetics, and all 3 patients with secondary inv16 were in this group.

Response and Outcome
There were no responses in the 3 patients who were
treated below the target dose of low-dose cytarabine.
Among the 61 patients who were treated at the target
dose, 21 patients (34%) achieved CR, including 15 of
50 patients (30%) with secondary or treatmentrelated AML, 10 of 33 patients (30%) with unfavorable cytogenetics, and 6 of 34 patients (18%) patients
with baseline poor performance status. One additional patient with long-standing, antecedent myelofibrosis met criteria for CR other than persistent
splenomegaly, and a second patient had normalization of blood counts and disappearance of peripheral
blasts but refused confirmatory bone marrow evaluation. The characteristics of responders are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
The median age of patients who responded to
treatment was 74 years, and the median age of nonresponders was 71 years. Eight of 23 patients (35%)
aged 75 years, 4 of 25 patients (16%) with a performance status of 2, and 2 of 9 patients (22%) with
a performance status of 3 achieved CR. Among
responders, 15 patients (65%) had secondary AML or
an antecedent hematologic disorder, 10 of 23 patients
(43%) had an unfavorable karyotype, 10 of 23 patients
(43%) had an intermediate karyotype, and 3 patients
(13%) had secondary inv16. Normalization of cytogenetics was observed in addition to morphologic CR
in 7 of 14 patients who had baseline abnormal karyotype (50%), including 3 of 3 patients with inv16. The
mean white blood cell count among responders at
presentation was 2.8 3 109/L (range, 1-36 3 109/L).
Of 27 patients who had baseline white blood cell
counts >10 3 109/L, 2 patients (7%) achieved CR.
The mean baseline bone marrow blast percentage
was 35%, and 2 patients met morphologic criteria for
erythroleukemia.
The induction mortality rate was 11% for the
whole cohort and 8% for the 61 patients who were
treated at the low-dose cytarabine target dose,
including 4 patients (6%) with sepsis and 3 patients
(5%) with disease progression. At a median follow-up
298 days (range, 175-719 days), the median survival
was 157 days (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 110303 days) (Fig. 1). For patients who were treated
at the low-dose cytarabine target dose, the median

were 41 patients who remained alive 3 months after the initiation of treatment. Among the 23 responding patients, there were 9 deaths, and median
survival was 562 days (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 308 days; upper
limit not estimated). Among 18 nonresponders, there were 15 deaths, with

2 induction cycles to achieve remission. The median
time to remission was 46 days. Patients were on
study for a mean of 133 days. The mean days of hospitalization was 39, including elective admissions for
patients who were unable to receive outpatient treatment for logistic reasons.
Four patients underwent reduced-intensity
conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation after arsenic trioxide and low-dose cytarabine. One
woman aged 61 years with leukemic transformation
of myelofibrosis achieved morphologic CR but had
residual splenomegaly. She subsequently died from
complications of transplantation. A woman aged
59 years with secondary AML that evolved from myelodysplastic syndrome achieved CR with arsenic
trioxide and low-dose cytarabine but died of transplantation complications. A women aged 66 years
with treatment-related AML after chemotherapy for
breast cancer and a woman aged 69 years with treatment-related AML after radiotherapy for breast
cancer both had unfavorable cytogenetics at baseline
and attained a CR after arsenic trioxide and low-dose
cytarabine. They remained well clinically and in
remission >18 months after undergoing reduced-intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Toxicity
Common toxicities are summarized in Table 4, The
toxicities observed in >50% of patients included fa-

tigue, nausea, diarrhea, rash, peripheral edema, and
elevated transaminases. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic
toxicities were infrequent. Grade 4 myelosuppression
was observed in all patients, and >80% had at least
1 episode of febrile neutropenia. There were 37 episodes (58%) of bacteremia and 9 (14%) clinically significant bleeding events, including hemoptysis
(1 patient), gastrointestinal bleeding (3 patients),
subdural hematoma (2 patients), alveolar bleeding
(1 patient), groin hematoma (1 patient), and vaginal
bleeding (1 patient). Fifteen patients (23%) had pleural effusions requiring diuretics; neither these effusions nor the bleeding events were clearly drugrelated. Fourteen patients (22%) required treatment
or observation in the medical intensive care unit.
One thousand six hundred fifty electrocardiograms revealed no clinically significant drug-related
arrhythmias. There were no episodes of torsade de
pointes. By using the Bazett correction, there were
298 electrocardiograms with a QTc >500 msec and
13 with a QT >500 msec.

DISCUSSION
Overall survival in elderly patients with AML is dismal. Intensive induction has high mortality, significant morbidity, and little probability of long-term
success in most older patients. Many modifications
to standard anthracycline/cytarabine induction have
been attempted, including intensification of anthracyclines, substitution of an anthracenedione, intensification of cytarabine in induction or consolidation,
the addition of other cytotoxic agents, and priming
with growth factors.17-25 Although randomized trials
have demonstrated differences in CR and diseasefree survival, there have been no significant differences in overall survival. In addition, there are inadequate quality-of-life data in elderly AML patients

2510

undergoing active treatment, and there is no consensus on determining which older patients are good
candidates for intensive therapy. Thus, there is no
accepted standard of care, and older patients with
AML should be treated on clinical trials whenever
possible.
The results of the current study demonstrate that
arsenic trioxide can be combined with low-dose
cytarabine. The extramedullary toxicity profile was
favorable, with significantly lower induction mortality
and much less severe nausea, emesis, diarrhea, and
mucositis than with intensive induction chemotherapy. Although both drugs have been described as
differentiating agents, there was no clinical or morphologic evidence of this. Alopecia was not observed.
Rash, edema, and headache were common but mild
and reversible. Prolongation of the QTc interval was
common, but there were no clinically significant
drug-related arrhythmias.
The regimen caused more significant myelosuppression than expected with either agent alone,
requiring aggressive supportive care and frequent
treatment for infection and bleeding. It is noteworthy
that all responding patients achieved bone marrow
aplasia. The addition of arsenic trioxide approximately doubled the CR rate expected with low-dose
cytarabine alone, and there was a clear survival benefit for patients who achieved CR. In addition, the
addition of arsenic trioxide may have hastened the
time to CR, which was 114 days (range, 50-313 days)
with low-dose cytarabine alone in the Medical
Research Council trial.6 Most importantly, although
there were no remissions in patients who had unfavorable cytogenetics in the Medical Research Council
trial, in the current study, 10 patients in this poorprognosis group achieved CR with the addition of arsenic trioxide. All 3 patients with inv(16) also
achieved CR; although this abnormality is generally
considered to have a favorable prognosis, these
patients had the unusual and less favorable circumstance of having inv(16) in the setting of secondary
disease. The arsenic trioxide and low-dose cytarabine combination was able to induce remission
even in patients with the worst prognosis, including
those with advanced age, poor performance status,
secondary disease, antecedent hematologic disorders, and unfavorable cytogenetics. Finally, there
were no unanticipated toxicities in the 4 patients
who underwent reduced-intensity transplantation
after treatment.
Low-dose cytarabine frequently is offered as an
alternative to intensive induction and is currently the
‘control arm’ on several ongoing randomized trials in
elderly AML. Nevertheless, a treatment that has a

<20% remission rate obviously leaves considerable
room for improvement. There have been many single-institution, small, phase 2 trials with promising
CR rates and tolerability in older AML patients, but
none has emerged as clearly superior, and it is hazardous to compare data retrospectively. The frustration of having treated thousands of older patients
with a variety of regimens without any significant
improvement in outcome has led investigators in the
Medical Research Council to adopt a novel ‘pick-awinner,’ randomized, phase 2 trial design to more
efficiently compare several low-dose cytarabinebased combination regimens, including arsenic trioxide, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, clofarabine, and tipifarnib, with their standard low-dose cytarabine
arm.26 It is noteworthy that the agents selected for
combination with low-dose cytarabine in this and
other ongoing trials have limited single-agent efficacy, including some, such as farnesyl transferase
inhibitors and flt-3 inhibitors, that have convincing
preclinical rationales. However, it is reasonable to
systematically add agents with favorable, nonoverlapping toxicities systematically to a low-dose cytarabine ‘backbone’ in the hope of creating a superior
regimen. If arsenic trioxide adds significantly to
low-dose cytarabine in an ongoing randomized trial,
then its availability as an oral formulation, which
can be accomplished readily, would make its incorporation into elderly AML regimens even more
appealing.
