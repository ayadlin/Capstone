Abstract
We show, in a series of established experimental breast adenocarcinomas and fibrosarcomas induced by
carcinogen de novo in mice, that the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin treatment is dependent on CD8 T cells
and IFN-g production. Doxorubicin treatment enhances tumor antigen–specific proliferation of CD8 T cells in
tumor-draining lymph nodes and promotes tumor infiltration of activated, IFN-g–producing CD8 T cells.
Optimal doxorubicin treatment outcome also requires both interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-17 cytokines, as blockade
of IL-1b/IL-1R or IL-17A/IL-17Ra signaling abrogated the therapeutic effect. IL-23p19 had no observed role. The
presence of gd T cells, but not Ja18þ natural killer T cells, at the time of doxorubicin treatment was also
important. In tumor samples taken from breast cancer patients prior to treatment with anthracycline
chemotherapy, a correlation between CD8a, CD8b, and IFN-g gene expression levels and clinical response
was observed, supporting their role in the therapeutic efficacy of anthracyclines in humans. Overall, these data
strongly support the pivotal contribution of both innate and adaptive immunity in treatment outcomes of
anthracycline chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(14); 4809–20. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Chemotherapy treatment in cancer has long been associated
with development of systemic immunosuppression (1, 2).
However, more recent studies have reported augmentation
of antitumor immune responses by chemotherapy (reviewed in
ref. 3). The immunostimulatory properties of chemotherapy
have been associated with increased expression of "stress-like"
molecules by damaged or dying tumor cells, such as killer cell
lectin-like receptor sub-family K ligands, Fas, and tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
death receptors and HSPs, that render cells receptive to direct
attack by cells of the innate immune system; including natural
killer (NK) cells, natural killer T cells (NKT cells), and gd T cells
(reviewed in ref. 4). Until recently, the mechanisms by which
chemotherapy treatment facilitated an adaptive, tumorAuthors' Affiliations: 1Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum

specific immune response were largely uncharacterized. Certain alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns are
expressed or released during tumor cell death induced by
immunogenic chemotherapeutic agents, including anthracyclines. These include translocation of the endoplasmic reticulum resident calreticulin complex to the plasma membrane,
providing an "eat-me" signal (5–7) and release of the nuclear
alarmin HMGB1 to engage TLR-4 on dendritic cells (DC; refs. 8,
9). In addition, we showed recently that dying tumor cells
release ATP, which then acts on P2X7 purinergic receptors
from DCs and triggers the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin
domain–containing-3 protein (NLRP3)-dependent caspase-1
activation complex (inflammasome), allowing for the secretion
of proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1b. Accordingly, anticancer chemotherapy turned out to be inefficient against tumors
established in purinergic receptor P2rx7  or Nlrp3 or Casp1deficient hosts (10).
Anthracyclines have been used in anticancer treatment for
more than 40 years and now have a major role in the management of leukemia, lymphoma, uterine, ovarian, sarcoma, and
breast malignancies. Doxorubicin became the most widely
used anthracycline because of lower toxicity and potent
antitumor activity against solid tumors. Although there were
earlier reports evidencing the immune system contribution to
doxorubicin-mediated antitumor effects (11, 12), Maccubbin
and colleagues were the first to show that doxorubicin was an
effective immunomodulator capable of boosting CTL
responses (13). A multitude of studies investigating combination treatment of doxorubicin and immunotherapies followed;
however, the underlying mechanisms of how immunogenic
cell death caused by doxorubicin links to induction of a
cytotoxic CD8 T-cell response were largely unknown.

Mattarollo et al.

Using experimental and carcinogen-induced mouse models
of breast cancer and fibrosarcoma, respectively, here we show
key cytokines and immune cell populations required for the
antitumor therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin. We show that
CD8 T cells and IFN-g are critical effectors of IL-1b- and IL-17–
dependent signaling in response to doxorubicin-treated breast
tumors and sarcomas, and corroborating this, we also report
that CD8a, CD8b, and IFN-g gene expression levels in breast
cancer patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy
correlate with treatment response.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Inbred wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and
OT-I mice carrying a MHC class I-restricted transgenic T-cell
receptor (TCR) for the ovalbumin (OVA257–264; SIINFEKL)
peptide were obtained from Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
(WEHI; Parkville, Australia). C57BL/6 gene–targeted knockout IFN-g /, IL-1R/, IL-17A/, TCRd/, Ja18/, IL23p19/, and IL-12p35/ mice were bred and maintained
at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center (Peter Mac; East
Melbourne, Australia) as previously described (14, 15).
TCRd/ mice were obtained from I. Frazer (University of
Queensland, Australia) and IL-17A/ mice were kindly
provided by Y. Iwakura (University of Tokyo, Japan). Mice
of 6 to 14 weeks of age were used in all experiments, and all
procedures were approved by the Peter Mac Animal Ethics
Committee.
Tumor models
Experimental. C57BL/6-derived AT3 (kindly provided by
Trina Stewart, Peter Mac) and EO771 (16) and BALB/c-derived
H2N100 mammary adenocarcinoma (17) lines, and BALB/cderived MCA2 (derived in-house from mice with an MCAinduced tumor) and C57BL/6-derived MCA205 (provided by
L.Z.) fibrosarcoma lines, were all maintained in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The OVAexpressing AT3 line (AT3OVA) was generated by retrovirally
infecting the AT3 parental line with pMIG/MSCV-IRES-eGFP
plasmid encoding membrane-bound OVA. To examine s.c.
tumor growth, WT or gene-targeted mice were inoculated s.c.
on the hind flank with the indicated number of cells and
tumor size monitored. Once tumors were established (0.2–0.5
cm2) mice received a single intratumoral (i.t.) or i.v. treatment
of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX; Sandoz) or equivalent
volume of PBS. Some mice received control Ig (cIg; Mac-4 or
agp3), anti-IFN-g (R4-6A2), anti-CD8a (53.6.72), anti-CD8b
(53.5.8), anti-IL-1b (B122.10), anti-IL-17A (M210), anti-IL17Ra (M751), or anti-IL-23p19 (16E5) monoclonal antibody
(mAb) at the time of PBS/doxorubicin treatment, as indicated
in the legends to neutralize or deplete cell subsets. Anti-agp3,
anti-IL-23p19, anti-IL-17A, and anti-IL-17Ra mAb were kindly
provided by AMGEN Inc.
3-Methylcholanthrene-induced carcinogenesis. Groups
of male BALB/c WT mice were inoculated s.c. in the hind flank
with 400 mg of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA; Sigma-Aldrich in
0.1 mL of corn oil as described; ref. 18). When sarcomas had

4810

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

established (palpable tumor 0.2–0.45 cm2) mice received i.t.
doxorubicin or PBS once a week for 2 weeks. Some mice
received cIg, anti-CD8a, anti-IFN-g, anti-IL-1b, anti-IL-23p19,
or anti-IL-17Ra on days 1, 0, and weekly thereafter for
6 weeks relative to initial PBS/doxorubicin treatment. Development of fibrosarcomas was monitored weekly over the
course of 250 days.
In vivo CD8 T-cell assays and flow cytometry. OT-I T
cells were purified from spleens and lymph nodes of OT-I
transgenic mice, with positive selection using a CD8 T-cell
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). CD8 T-cell purity was always
found to be greater than 90%. Purified OT-I cells were labeled
with 2.5 mmol/L carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)
and injected i.v. (2  106) into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice
harboring established, PBS/doxorubicin-treated AT3OVA or
AT3-empty vector (AT3EV) tumors. Five days later, tumordraining lymph nodes (TDLN) were harvested and CFSE dilution in CD8þKbOVA257–264-tetramerþ cells was assessed by
flow cytometry. Indices of proliferation were generated using
FlowJo software (Tree Star). For tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte
(TIL) analysis, AT3-OVA tumors were excised and single-cell
suspensions created by a combination of collagenase type 4
(Worthington Biochemical Corp.) and DNase I (Roche) enzymatic digestion at 37 C, and mechanical disruption. OT-I T
cells were identified by antibody staining with anti-CD45.2
(104; eBioscience), anti-CD8a (Ly-2; eBioscience), and
KbOVA257–264-tetramer (provided by A. Brooks). Dead cells
were excluded by addition of 1 mg/mL of fluorogold (SigmaAldrich) in the final wash. Cells were acquired on an LSR-II (BD)
or Canto II (BD) flow cytometer and analysis was done using
FlowJo software. For intracellular IFN-g analysis, tumor cell
suspensions were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS in the presence of 0.1 mmol/L OVA257–264
(SIINFEKL) peptide (Auspep Pty) and 5 ng/mL recombinant
mouse IL-2 (BD Biosciences). Monensin (BioLegend) was
added to the cells in the final 4 hours of culture to inhibit
cytokine release from the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum complex. Permeabilization and fixation of cells were conducted
using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions (BD Biosciences) before staining with
anti-IFN-g mAb (XMG1.2; eBioscience).
Gene expression analysis
Two cohorts of breast cancer gene expression data sets
were used for these analyses. Complete clinical data are
included in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary
Table S1). The first comprised early-stage breast cancer
patients who had received no systemic treatment to determine the association of the genes with clinical outcome
without anthracycline (i.e., association with prognosis). The
4 data sets used (NKI; ref. 19; VDX; ref. 20; MAINZ; ref. 21; and
TRANSBIG; ref. 22) have been previously described. Clinical
endpoint used for the analyses was the first distant metastatic
event. Tumor biopsy samples taken for gene expression
profiling were collected at surgery. Gene expression data sets
were retrieved from public databases or authors’ Web sites.
We used normalized data (log2 intensity in singlechannel platforms or log2 ratio in dual-channel platforms).

Efficacy of Doxorubicin Requires Antitumor Immunity

Hybridization probes were mapped to the Entrez GeneID as in
Shi and colleagues, 23, using RefSeq and Entrez database
version 2007.01.21. When multiple probes were mapped to
the same GeneID, the one with the highest variance in a
particular data set was selected to represent the GeneID. Each
gene analyzed was then scaled such that quartiles 2.5% and
97.5% are equal to 1 and þ1, respectively. This scaling is
robust to outliers and hence allows combination of the
microarray data from each data set. This meta-analytic technique has been previously described (24–26). Univariate Cox
regression analysis was used to determine prognostic significance with clinical outcome of the genes as a continuous
measurement and were calculated stratified by data set.
The second cohort of breast cancer patients was treated
with anthracycline chemotherapy to determine the association of immune genes with clinical response to doxorubicin.
These women received epirubicin as single-agent chemotherapy (100 mg/m2) for 4 cycles prior to surgery in the setting of a
neoadjuvant clinical trial (clinical trials.gov NCT00162812; ref.
27). Epirubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy favored in
clinical practice due to its better toxicity profile than doxorubicin. Tumor biopsy samples were taken using a core biopsy
14- to 16-G needle prior to chemotherapy. Clinical endpoint
used was pathologic complete response (pCR) documented at
surgery, which is an accepted surrogate for disease-free and
overall survival in breast cancer. Genes were correlated with
pCR as a continuous variable (i.e., to determine whether
higher expression correlated with a higher chance of obtained
pCR), using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and
measured using an area under the curve (AUC). Microarray
analysis was done using Affymetrix GeneChips.
Statistical analysis
Mouse. Statistical analyses were done using GraphPad
Prism software. Significant differences between groups were
assessed by a 2-tailed t test or Mann–Whitney U test, as
indicated. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.
Human. Statistical analysis using gene expression data
was done with R version 2.5.1 and BioConductor version 1.8. R
code used is available as "genefu" from the comprehensive
R archive network. The remaining statistical analyses were
conducted on SPSS 18.0 (SPSS, Inc.). Results were not corrected for multiple testing, as the analyses were considered
hypothesis generating.

Results
The efficacy of doxorubicin therapy in established s.c.
tumors requires CD8þ cells and IFN-g
Both CD8 T cells and IFN-g are important in immunosurveillance of a range of malignancies (28–31). More recently,
adaptive immunity and IFN-g have been implicated in the
immunogenic effects of chemotherapy (10, 32), but CD8þ T
cells have not been previously directly shown to contribute to
the antitumor activity of doxorubicin. Despite the fact that
anthracyclines are commonly used in the clinical management of human breast cancer, very little data concerning the
mechanism of action of doxorubicin against mammary carci-

www.aacrjournals.org

nomas has been obtained in experimental models or from
clinical samples. We assessed the requirement for CD8þ T
cells and IFN-g in the effectiveness of doxorubicin chemotherapy treatment against a variety of established breast cancers
and fibrosarcomas. In WT mice, a localized (i.t.) treatment of
doxorubicin was sufficient to suppress s.c. growth of AT3,
H2N100, and EO771 mammary tumors and MCA205 fibrosarcomas (Fig. 1A–D). Depletion of CD8aþ cells or neutralization
of IFN-g with mAb administration immediately prior to
doxorubicin treatment severely abrogated the antitumor
effect of the drug in the established tumor setting with
significant loss of tumor growth suppression (Fig. 1A–D).
Abrogation of doxorubicin efficacy was also observed in
IFN-g / mice (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the loss of therapeutic effect of doxorubicin following anti-CD8a mAb treatment was specifically due to depletion of CD8þ T cells, we
assessed an additional group of mice receiving anti-CD8b
mAb prior to doxorubicin treatment of established MCA2
fibrosarcoma tumors. Depletion of CD8 T cells alone was
sufficient to abrogate the antitumor effect of doxorubicin
(Fig. 1E). In addition, mice challenged with MCA2 tumors
were treated with i.v. delivery of doxorubicin to establish that
systemic administration of doxorubicin was comparable with
localized treatment at inducing CD8 T cell and IFN-g–
mediated antitumor activity. For the first time, these studies
validate across a series of experimental tumors the critical role
of CD8þ T cells and IFN-g in vivo in the mechanism of
antitumor activity of doxorubicin.
Carcinogen-induced tumors respond to doxorubicin in
a CD8 T-cell- and IFN-g–dependent manner
The activity and mechanism of action of most cancer
therapies, including doxorubicin, have rarely if ever been
assessed in mouse models of de novo tumorigenesis. This
type of model is more practical in assessing any agent's action
in the context of a developing and progressing tumor, as
opposed to a transplant setting. Recently, we have employed
established fibrosarcomas induced by MCA in mice as a
therapeutic model for various immune targets (33, 34) and
to determine the importance of host IL-1b in the mechanism
of action of doxorubicin (10). To date, however, the importance of many other host immune elements in doxorubicin
antitumor activity has not been examined in a mouse model in
which the tumor has arisen de novo in the host. Depletion of
CD8 T cells following establishment of palpable sarcomas
(0.20–0.45 cm2) did not significantly alter the growth kinetics
of the established tumor (Fig. 2, left; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Doxorubicin treatment (i.t.) of established MCA sarcomas
achieved modest tumor growth suppression in most mice,
and 4 of 30 (13%) showed a significant period of retarded
tumor growth but eventually succumbed (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S4). This variable response was consistent with the
vast heterogeneity between individual MCA-induced fibrosarcomas. Importantly, the significant therapeutic effect of doxorubicin in inhibiting fibrosarcoma growth across the whole
cohort of control mAb-treated mice (P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. S4) was abolished if mice received anti-CD8a mAb or
anti-IFN-g mAb during doxorubicin therapy (Fig. 2B and C;

for infiltrating Ag-specific OT-I cells (Fig. 4B). Doxorubicin
treatment also induced Ag-specific IFN-g production from
CD8 TILs, observed after in vitro restimulation with cognate
antigen (Fig. 4C). No cytokine was detected from CD8 TILs in
the absence of restimulation (data not shown). These experiments are amongst the first to directly isolate and show the
increase in the proportion of tumor-localized and functional
CD8þ T cells following treatment with doxorubicin.

Doxorubicin treatment requires IL-1b and IL-17 but
not IL-23p19
We have recently shown that IL-1b production is pivotal for
a robust antitumor response to chemotherapy, by facilitating
the priming of tumor-specific CD8 T cells (10). We now have
extended these findings in a range of mammary adenocarcinomas to show that IL-1b/IL-1R signaling is also critical to the
therapeutic outcome of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 5).
Because IL-1b is known to regulate IL-17 responses (35–
37), we utilized both IL-17A/ mice and an anti-IL-17Ra
mAb to also show a critical role for IL-17 in doxorubicin
treatment of transplantable mammary tumors (Fig. 5). In
concert with the mammary carcinoma data, a critical role
for IL-1b and IL-17A in doxorubicin antitumor activity was
also illustrated using fibrosarcomas generated de novo by
MCA (Fig. 6B and D; Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly,
the absence of IL-1 or IL-17 signaling had little or no direct
effect on the growth of untreated established tumors. In
contrast IL-23, another immunoregulatory cytokine known
to cooperate with IL-1b in the regulation of IL-17 responses
(35–37), was dispensable in these models, as no alteration in
doxorubicin efficacy was observed in IL-23p19/ mice or by
neutralizing IL-23 in WT mice using an anti-IL-23 mAb
(Fig. 6C; Supplementary Figs. S2 and S4). In addition, by
comparison, the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin in transplanted tumors was partially reduced in the absence of the IL12p35 subunit (Supplementary Fig. S2).

stimulation (35, 36). We assessed the requirement for these
innate lymphocytes in doxorubicin therapy of established AT3
mammary tumors and MCA205 fibrosarcomas (Supplementary Fig. S3). The absence of type I Ja18þ NKT cells in
TCRJa18/ mice did not perturb the antitumor effects of
doxorubicin; however, deficiency of gd T cells in TCRd/
mice resulted in significant inhibition of doxorubicin activity
in both AT3 and MCA205 tumors. The loss of NKT cells or gd T
cells did not alter the outgrowth of these tumors in the
absence of therapy (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Clinical relevance using gene expression data from
human breast cancer patients
We went on to explore whether these genes were important
for therapeutic efficacy of anthracycline treatment in breast
cancer patients, using publicly available gene expression data
sets. The first cohort consisted of patients diagnosed at
multiple different hospitals who had their tumor biopsy
samples taken at surgery. The samples examined here are
representative of the global breast cancer population, as there
was a mixture of different tumor sizes, nodal status, and
estrogen receptor (ER) expression (Supplementary Table
S1). As these women received no systemic treatment, the true
prognostic effects of these genes could be examined without
treatment confounders. Therefore, we could examine the
prognostic significance of CD8A, CD8B, IFN-g, IL1B, IL17A,
and IL23p19 genes independent of anthracycline therapy in
patients who had received no systemic treatment (refs. 19–22;
Table 1). As observed, only high IFN-g levels were associated
with a good prognosis in these women, that is, high levels were
associated with fewer long-term breast cancer relapses.

We then went on to examine these genes in the context of
treatment with anthracycline chemotherapy. The second
cohort consisted of women enrolled into a breast cancer
clinical trial specifically designed to investigate biomarkers
to anthracycline chemotherapy. As a consequence, all of the
women in this study were negative for expression of ER (as this
is the more chemoresponsive breast cancer population) and
all received single-agent epirubicin, an anthracycline-type
chemotherapy commonly used in clinical practice. Tumor
biopsy samples were taken with core biopsy needles and were
subject to gene expression profiling prior to chemotherapy
(27). In these breast cancer patients, increasing levels of IFN-g,
as well as CD8a and CD8b were associated with a better
response to therapy, as measured by the amount of tumor left
at surgical resection after 4 cycles of therapy. Notably, the
complete disappearance of invasive tumor after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was associated with an excellent survival from
breast cancer and is an accepted surrogate for long-term
survival from breast cancer (40). There was no significance
for the other genes in these cohorts. Overall, these data
support further the role of IFN-g, CD8a, and CD8b in the
clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients who have received
anthracycline-type chemotherapy.

Anthracyclines are front-line chemotherapeutic agents in
the treatment of breast cancers and sarcomas. In this study,
we have provided an extensive amount of new data exploring
the mechanism of action of doxorubicin in a series of transplantable mammary carcinomas and fibrosarcomas generated
de novo by MCA. The new data in AT3, H2N100, and EO771
mammary tumor models showed the critical role of host CD8þ
T cells and IFN-g, additionally supported by novel human
clinical data in 2 different cohorts of women with breast
cancer. Our study is the first to describe the specific importance of CD8þ T cells in vivo, as opposed to broadly assessing
adaptive immunity by employing RAG-deficient or nude mice
that are deficient in many immune components including all
T-cell subsets and B cells. Furthermore, analysis included
CD8a- and CD8b-specific depletions to specifically define
the importance of CD8þ T cells. Doxorubicin treatment
enhanced the proliferation of CD8 T cells in the tumor
DLN in a cognate antigen-specific manner. Moreover, localized doxorubicin treatment increased the proportions of CD8

inoculation. Some mice received control Ig (cIg), anti-IL-1b, or anti-IL17Ra (500 mg i.p.) on days 7, 8, 15, and 22 relative to tumor inoculation.

Figure 6. Tumors induced de novo by carcinogen respond to doxorubicin
in an IL-1b– and IL-17–dependent manner. Groups of 15 to 30 male
BALB/c WT mice were injected s.c. on the flank with 400 mg MCA on day 0.
When sarcomas had established (the second week of palpable tumor
0.20–0.45 cm2) BALB/c mice received either i.t. PBS (left) or doxorubicin
(50 mL, 2 mmol/L; right) once a week for 2 weeks. Some mice received (A)

death associated with doxorubicin treatment enhances the
generation and functional activation of tumor-reactive CD8 T
cells that are required for the antitumor activity of doxorubicin.
We also completed the most extensive characterization of
mechanism of action of doxorubicin in tumors established de
novo by carcinogen, including a comparative evaluation of the
role of CD8þ T cells, IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-17A, and IL-23. These
types of established tumors generated de novo are arguably
more relevant than any short-term transplanted tumors that
have been used to previously establish the principles that
chemotherapy may be immunogenic. Our study has clearly
shown that CD8þ T cells, IFN-g, IL-1b, and IL-17A but not IL23, were critical in the antitumor activity of doxorubicin. We
further illustrated the key role of IL-1b and IL-17A, but not IL23, in doxorubicin control of a series of mammary carcinomas.
Our data extend our recently published data that illustrated
the importance of IL-17A in the antitumor activity of doxorubicin against transplanted MCA205 tumors and tracked the
generation of IL-17–producing gdþ T cells following doxorubicin treatment (41). We confirmed the role of gdþ T cells,
but not type I NKT cells, in the mechanism of action of
doxorubicin, using transplantable mammary carcinomas.
In human breast cancer patients, although IFN-g levels
seemed relevant for patient clinical outcome independent
of anthracycline, the importance of both CD8 T cells and
IFN-g in therapeutic efficacy was supported by the observation that increasing levels of CD8a, CD8b, and IFN-g gene
expression correlated with a better response to anthracycline
chemotherapy. Notably, here the tumor biopsy samples were
taken prior to chemotherapy, supporting the concept that an
intact immune system aids therapeutic response to anthracyclines. However, it would be most interesting to also see the
relative changes in gene expression before and shortly after
administration of therapy. Although the analyses in human
breast cancer patients presented here are limited by the use of
retrospective data sets, nonrandomized treatment cohorts,
and patients treated with epirubicin rather than doxorubicin,
which is a different type of anthracycline chemotherapy, it
supports our laboratory observations and a recent study (42)
of the clinical relevance of antitumor immunity for better
clinical outcomes from anthracycline therapy in breast cancer.
It is likely that the context in which IL-17A is produced,
particularly the constituents of the tumor microenvironment,
will determine the outcome of IL-17 secretion. IL-17 production, particularly from innate T lymphocytes such as NKT cells
and gd T cells, is dependent on IL-1R signaling (36, 43) and has
been shown to boost CD8 T-cell IFN-g responses (44). Given
the requirement for IL-1b and CD8 T cells in the antitumor
immune response following doxorubicin treatment, we
assessed the role for IL-17 as an intermediary molecule in
this pathway. IL-17A or IL-17Ra blockade resulted in loss of
doxorubicin efficacy, very similar to that of IL-1b/IL-1R blockade, indicating that IL-17 is probably a major downstream
response cytokine to IL-1b secretion. Interestingly, IL-23, itself
a modulator of antitumor immunity (45–48), but also an
important cofactor along with IL-1b in the stimulation of
IL-17 production from memory T cells (37), NKT cells (35), and
gd T cells (36), was dispensable in doxorubicin treatment

Association of genes with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with and without anthracycline chemotherapy. Cohort 1
consisted of 1,062 patients from 4 gene expression data sets who received no systemic treatment after their surgery to determine the
clinical outcome association independent of anthracycline. Seventy percent of tumors were ER-positive, 85% were node negative at
diagnosis. Univariate HRs presented are stratified by data set. Genes are correlated as continuous variables. Here, increasing
expression of IFN-g is correlated with a good prognosis or a longer time free from distant metastases. Cohort 2 consisted of 114
patients treated in a neoadjuvant trial of the anthracycline epirubicin given as a sole therapy prior to surgery. All patients were ERnegative with 86% of tumors greater than 2 cm and 54% with positive lymph nodes at study entry. Biopsies were taken prior to
therapy. Here, increasing expression of IFN-g, CD8A, and CD8B is associated with a higher chance of a complete response from
chemotherapy at surgery. In this second cohort, a pCR was strongly correlated with a better survival from breast cancer. (Full clinical
information for cohorts 1 and 2 can be found in the Supplementary Table S1.)

of breast cancers and fibrosarcomas, with no alteration in
therapeutic effect following IL-23 blockade. Notably, gene
expression of IL1B, IL17A, or IL23 was not associated with
clinical outcomes to doxorubicin treatment in human breast
cancer patients, but perhaps this was not surprising given that
the tumor biopsy samples were taken prior to doxorubicin
treatment, and these cytokines were likely to be induced
following treatment. In a parallel study, we have very recently
shown that IL-17 from gd T cells is critical for the efficacy of
chemotherapy and preceded the activation and polarization of
CD8 T cells for IFN-g production (41). Also, gd T cells that
lacked IL-1R lost the capacity to amplify the action of chemotherapy, confirming the causal relationship with IL-1b
production from adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) causing
IL-17 production from gd T cells and resulting in IFN-g
production from tumor-specific CD8 T cells. The current study
provides important additional data in mammary tumor transplant and de novo fibrosarcoma models to support a role for IL17A in doxorubicin mechanism of action. In doing so, we also
show the relevance of gdþ T cells but not of type I NKT cells.
Overall, our in vivo mouse data and human genetic analysis
show the role of host CD8 T cells and IFN-g in doxorubicin
mechanism of action. The study also strongly supports our
most recent work on the role of IL-17A in the mechanism of
action of chemotherapy (41), particularly with respect to novel
data concerning doxorubicin and mammary carcinoma. In
addition, it extensively characterizes mechanism of action of
doxorubicin in tumors established de novo by carcinogen,
including comparative evaluation of the role of CD8þ T cells,
IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-17, and IL-23. These types of established

4818

tumors are arguably more relevant than any short-term
transplanted tumors that have been used to previously establish the principle that chemotherapy may be immunogenic.
The work corroborates recent studies showing that numbers
of TILs in breast cancer are a predictor of response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (49, 50). Similar outcomes in
mouse sarcomas suggest more widespread applicability of
these findings to other tumor cell and tissue types. Future
work should address how to facilitate the potential development of sustained tumor-specific, adaptive immunity by
anthracycline chemotherapy. This includes the generation
of long-lived memory T cells and identification of the patients
who are best candidates for such immunotherapeutic
approaches, as enhancing tumor immunosurveillance by chemotherapy may allow extended immune-mediated control of
the malignancy beyond the treatment period of the drug.
