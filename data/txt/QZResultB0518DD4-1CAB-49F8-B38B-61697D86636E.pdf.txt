APOBEC3 Cytidine Deaminases in Double-Strand DNA Break
Repair and Cancer Promotion
Roni Nowarski1,2 and Moshe Kotler1

Abstract
High frequency of cytidine to thymidine conversions was identiﬁed in the genome of several types of cancer
cells. In breast cancer cells, these mutations are clustered in long DNA regions associated with single-strand DNA
(ssDNA), double-strand DNA breaks (DSB), and genomic rearrangements. The observed mutational pattern
resembles the deamination signature of cytidine to uridine carried out by members of the APOBEC3 family of
cellular deaminases. Consistently, APOBEC3B (A3B) was recently identiﬁed as the mutational source in breast
cancer cells. A3G is another member of the cytidine deaminases family predominantly expressed in lymphoma
cells, where it is involved in mutational DSB repair following ionizing radiation treatments. This activity provides
us with a new paradigm for cancer cell survival and tumor promotion and a mechanistic link between ssDNA,
DSBs, and clustered mutations. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3494–8. 2013 AACR.

The seven human APOBEC3 proteins and their homologs in
other mammals are prominent members of a multifunctional
family of Zn2þ-dependent polynucleotide cytosine deaminases
(recently reviewed by ref. 1 and 2–4). APOBEC3 proteins elicit
DNA cytosine deaminase activity and show broad retrotransposon and retrovirus restriction activities. Two main groups
of APOBEC3 proteins can be identiﬁed on the basis of their
structure: A3A, A3C, and A3H have a single zinc-ﬁnger domain,
whereas A3B, A3D, A3G, and A3F bear two zinc-ﬁnger domains
(5, 6). These structural characteristics may underlie some of the
observed differences in protein functionality. In addition to the
APOBEC3 deaminases, the APOBEC family includes APOBEC1
and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), as well as
the less characterized proteins APOBEC2 and APOBEC4. APOBEC1 is an mRNA editor involved in the metabolism of
apolipoprotein B (APOB) in gastrointestinal cells. By editing
APOB mRNA residue C666, APOBEC1 generates an early stop
codon, resulting in synthesis of a shorter polypeptide. AID is a
B-cell–speciﬁc DNA deaminase involved in antibody diversiﬁcation by editing immunoglobulin–gene cytosines to trigger
somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination.
In the last decade, APOBEC3 proteins were identiﬁed as
potent mutators of viral DNA (1). Virtually all APOBEC3
members are involved in hypermutation of viral genomes that
replicate via synthesis of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) intermediates, including retroviruses, hepatitis B virus, and human

papillomavirus. However, the physiologic functions of APOBEC3 cytosine deaminases may include roles beyond their
involvement in innate immunity. APOBEC3G (A3G) was shown
to restrict replication of endogenous retroelements and human
endogenous retroviruses (HERV), thus contributing to maintenance of genomic stability (7, 8). In contrast, A3A was
implicated in several genome-destabilizing activities, including insertion of somatic mutations in human mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA (9, 10), demethylation of 5-methylcytosine
(11), and induction of DNA breaks in a deaminase-dependent
manner (9). In addition, A3A is involved in clearance of foreign
dsDNA from cells (12). Hence, cellular APOBEC3 deaminases
act as potent innate antiviral restriction factors, but may also
have diverse effects on genomic regulation and stability (13).
The potentially deleterious mutagenic activity of APOBEC
proteins is likely to be highly regulated, as exempliﬁed by
ectopic expression of AID by various cytokines leading to
carcinogenic mutagenesis of critical cancer-related genes
(14–16). However, a similar cancer-promoting role for APOBEC3s has only recently emerged. Nik-Zainal and colleagues
(17) conducted whole-genome sequencing of breast cancer
cells and nonmalignant tissues derived from 21 patients.
Analysis of somatic mutation patterns in breast cancer cells
revealed that genomes of cancer cells contain regions of
hypermutation named "Kataegis." Base substitutions in these
regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. Remarkably, mutations were closely associated with
regions of chromosomal rearrangements and occurred on the
same chromosomal strand over long genomic distances, suggesting that they occurred simultaneously or in a progressive
manner over a short time span (17). Moreover, short tandem
repeats or short stretches of identical sequences at the breakpoints (termed overlapping microhomology) ﬂanked each
insertion/deletion (indel) mutation. Repeat-mediated indels
were small (1–5 bp), whereas microhomology-associated
indels were mainly larger deletions (up to 50 bp).

APOBEC3 in Cancer Promotion

These ﬁndings are strongly supported by the mutational
signature in yeast cells proliferating under chronic DNAdamaging conditions and in other human malignant tumors
(18). In both these highly divergent biologic systems, mutations were clustered in long ssDNA regions associated with
double-strand DNA breaks (DSB) and genomic rearrangements. In agreement with Nik-Zanihal and colleagues
(17, 18), Roberts and colleagues (18) claimed that "once a
mutagen is present (methyl-methane-sulfonate in yeast or
potentially APOBEC in cancers), the limiting factor in cluster
formation seems to be the formation of ssDNA, where the
length of ssDNA region and the time it persists are the key
parameters determining the cluster's mutation density and
length". Both reports elicited the signature of the predominant mutations assigned for APOBEC3 deamination activity. A solid support to this assumption was recently provided
by Burns and colleagues (19), identifying A3B as a mutational source in breast cancer cells.
Concurrently with the above mentioned reports, we
described a novel role for A3G in promoting DSB repair in
lymphoma cells, which is ssDNA cytidine deamination
dependent (20). The biochemical characteristics of A3G
provide the mechanistic platform for the genetic alterations
observed in yeast and cancer cells: (i) A3G conducts cytidine
deamination on ssDNA, and it is able to interact with the
extreme cytosine of the ssDNA 30 -terminus. (ii) A3G undergoes intersegmental transfer on ssDNA, a translocation
mechanism involving simultaneous binding of two long or
short ssDNA segments, directing dispersed hypermutation
of cytidine targets. This intersegmental mechanism could be
responsible for the appearance of expanded regions of
hypermutation, referred to as clusters or "Kataegis." (iii)
A3G juxtaposes two 30 ssDNA termini with minimal terminal
microhomology. (iv) A3G mixed with HeLa whole-cell
extracts efﬁciently supports the end joining of linearized
plasmids. Association of A3G with ssDNA ends, together
with its ability to mediate interstrand synapsis, led us to
speculate that A3G may promote ssDNA end joining. Hence,
the formation of end synapses and overlapping microhomology, as well as chromosomal translocations described in
yeast cells, breast cancer, and lymphomas (17, 18, 21), could
be caused by these APOBEC protein activities.
A3G was recently shown to activate ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) DNA damage checkpoint kinase in HIV-1–
infected cells containing deaminated viral DNA (22). High
expression of A3G in B cells of patients with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma treated with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy was associated with poor survival (23), suggesting that A3G may promote DNA repair. Several types of
cancer cells, such as lymphoma and myeloma cells, display
efﬁcient repair of genomic DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and enhanced cell survival after IR treatment.
Interestingly, these cells were found to express high levels of
A3G in comparison with their related normal cells. In
response to IR, A3G accumulates transiently in the nuclei
of these cells and is recruited to DSB repair foci. Consistent
with a direct role in DSB repair, inhibition of A3G expression,
or its deaminase activity, resulted in reduced DSB repair,

www.aacrjournals.org

whereas reconstitution of A3G expression in A3G-deﬁcient
leukemia cells enhanced DSB repair. To conﬁrm the hypothesis that A3G activity is involved in repairing DSBs, an
integrated reporter cassette containing an ISceI restriction
site was used. Activation of ISceI restriction enzyme in A3Gdeﬁcient cells induces a DSB that is repaired mainly by
nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), and approximately 10%
of DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination (HR;
ref. 24). In A3G-expressing cells, the number of DSBs
repaired by HR mechanisms was reduced, whereas mutagenic end-joining increased. These results identiﬁed A3G as
a component that promotes DSB repair by NHEJ or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ; ref. 20).
A3G deaminates a CpC target motif (in which the underlined
C is preferentially deaminated), whereas the other APOBEC3
enzymes preferentially use TpC ssDNA as a substrate (25, 26).
Although the APOBEC3 signature described in breast cancer
cells points to APOBEC3 activities distinguished from those of
A3G, we speculate that other members of the APOBEC family,
predominantly those with two zinc-ﬁnger domains (A3B, A3D,
A3G, and A3F) generally act as cell-speciﬁc prosurvival factors.
These APOBEC3 proteins may rescue cells from the frequently
occurring and highly genotoxic DSB lesions in genomic DNA,
via the mechanism we propose for A3G. For instance, A3B is
overexpressed in breast cancer cells, and is presumably responsible for many of the C-to-T somatic mutations in these tumor
cells (19). Recruitment of APOBEC3 enzymes to the DSB site to
participate in DSB repair (see below) could, in turn, insert
mutation via deamination. Indeed, two reports show association between genomic DNA rearrangements and hypermutation regions of "Kataegis" (17, 18). The fact that the APOBEC3
genes have been selected toward multiplication along evolution (primates/humans encode AID, A1, A2, A4, and seven
APOBEC3 proteins, four of which have two zinc ﬁngers,
whereas ﬁsh and birds express only AID and APOBEC2; ref. 26)
justiﬁes the multiplication and maintenance of promiscuous
and active deaminases in primates despite the potential threat
of mutational insertion.
Figure 1 depicts a model that may provide the mechanistic
framework for the function of APOBEC3 proteins in the setting
of genomic DNA breaks in human cells. Moreover, the results
described by Nowarski and colleagues and Burns and colleagues (19, 20) and the model described here may shed light on
the mechanism of somatic mutations in breast cancer cells
(17, 18). The cell-cycle phase and the nature of the DSB lesions
determine the DSB repair pathway (27, 28). NHEJ and MMEJ
repair DSBs occurring in all cell-cycle phases and represent the
major pathways in G1, whereas HR functions mainly in G2–S
phases. Simple DSBs may be repaired by direct ligation via the
NHEJ machinery while the breaks that often appear in breast
cancer cells or are introduced by IR and chemotherapies may
require end-processing by nucleolytic end-resection of ssDNA
at the DSB, affecting the recruitment of NHEJ, MMEJ, and HR
factors. C-to-U mutations along the resected ssDNA may lead
to formation of a base-excision repair (BER) complex containing RPA and UNG2 that bind directly to deoxy-uridine (dU;
refs. 29, 30). UNG2 preferentially deglycosylates dU residing on
ssDNA. The UNG2 activity forms an abasic site (31, 32), which

Figure 1. Deaminase-dependent and -independent models for A3G-mediated DSB repair. DSB end-resection by cellular nucleases/helicases (purple pacman)
generates long ssDNA overhangs (blue ribbon). The ssDNA terminus is targeted by A3G multimers that mediate microhomology-based tethering in an
interstrand synapse (IS; 1), facilitating MMEJ (2). A3G multimer disassembly generates multiple catalytic dimeric/monomeric mutational units (m), inducing
C>U hypermutation of resected ssDNA (3). Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) catalyzes removal of the uracil from deoxyuridine, forming an abasic site (a)
that is further cleaved by the base excision repair (BER) nuclease ApeI (4). Since A3G acts preferentially on the 30 cytidine in a polycytidine tract,
the truncated ssDNA is likely to end with two or more cytidines, reducing the search for microhomology by an incoming A3G multimer or other MMEJ factors
(5). Terminal deamination by A3G may also promote DNA extension by the BER machinery. Alternatively, the MRN complex may associate with an abasic
site and mediate cleavage of the ssDNA overhang (6). ssDNA end-bound MRN may then promote tethering of ssDNA termini, ATM activation (A) and
recruitment of the NHEJ machinery (7).

may lead to ssDNA cleavage by the MRN complex (33). In the
case of A3G, BER-mediated cleavage of deaminated ssDNA
will generate 30 ssDNA ending with two or more cytidines.
This process can facilitate the search for a homologous micropolyguanine tract, promoting A3G-mediated MMEJ.
DSB end-processing proceeds by a two-stage mechanism
initiated by the MRN-CtIP complex that generates short 30 terminal ssDNA overhangs, which are the substrates for the
major NHEJ factor DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA–
PK) complex. These overhangs are then extended by Exo1
and/or BLM helicase to generate extensive ssDNA tracts
several kb long, the substrate for HR factors such as Rad51
and Rad52 (34–39). Extensive DSB resection therefore
commits DSB repair to HR (40–42). The kinetics of A3G
recruitment to DSB foci assigns A3G as a factor associated
with persistent DSBs, which are not efﬁciently repaired
by NHEJ (20). Furthermore, the DSB frequency in A3Gdepleted cells was comparable with parental cells at early
time points following IR, suggesting that A3G is not involved in the classical NHEJ pathway. Taken together with the
association of mutation clusters density with ssDNA length
and persisting time (18), it is therefore plausible that A3G
engages DSBs in the process of repair by HR. Binding of
HR mediators occurs following extensive DSB end-resection, estimated to generate an average of 2–4 kb long
ssDNA in each side of the break (34). The propensity of

3496

A3G to form high-order homomultimers in cells and its
ability to simultaneously bind two ssDNA segments both
terminally and internally may directly promote HR by
juxtaposing resected ssDNA termini to homologous ssDNA
regions. It is also plausible that such synapses control the
proximity of broken DNA fragments following DSB resection, thus affecting adventitious repair resulting in chromosomal translocation. Alternatively, cytidine deamination
may enhance binding of HR factors such as RPA, as recently
shown for AID (43). However, we observed a cytidine
deamination–dependent shift from HR- to end-joining–
mediated repair in irradiated lymphoma cells. This may
be the result of resected ssDNA trimming that favors
reassociation of the NHEJ/MMEJ machinery over HR mediators, as discussed above. Similarly, the observed elevated
frequency of mutations and microhomology-mediated
indels in BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant tumors (17) reﬂects
the increased use of MMEJ instead of the impaired HR DSB
repair in these breast cancer cells (44, 45). The impaired
DSB repair in BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant tumors is also
consistent with the elevated frequency of C>T, G>A mutations induced by A3B (19).
In summary, A3G and probably other APOBEC proteins may
promote DSB repair by direct end synapsis and cytidine
deamination–dependent cleavage of resected ssDNA, facilitating MMEJ-directed repair and/or recruitment of MRN-ATM.

APOBEC3 in Cancer Promotion

Hence, APOBEC3 proteins play a dual role in promoting
survival of cells in vivo, ﬁrst by enhancing DSB repair following
genotoxic treatments or spontaneous breaks, thus preventing
cell death, and, second, by promoting a mutator phenotype
that drives tumor progression (46, 47, 48). Inhibition of APOBEC3 expression and/or its catalytic activity would increase
sensitivity to genotoxic agents and restrain the progressive
accumulation of mutations, which is one of the underlying
processes that characterizes the cancer phenotype (49, 50).
Hence, anti-APOBEC3 agents could be promising targets for
the treatment of cancers in the future. Our preliminary results
indicate that peptides aimed at inhibiting A3G activity in
cultured tumor cells increase their sensitivity to genotoxic
treatments.
