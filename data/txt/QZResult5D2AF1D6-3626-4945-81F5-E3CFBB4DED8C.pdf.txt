Abstract
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite involved in cancer development through stimulation
of cell survival, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Irreversible degradation of S1P is catalyzed by S1P lyase (SPL).
The human SGPL1 gene that encodes SPL maps to a region
often mutated in cancers. To investigate the effect of SPL deficiency on cell survival and transformation, the susceptibility
to anticancer drugs of fibroblasts generated from SPLdeficient mouse embryos (Sgpl1−/−) was compared with that
of cells from heterozygous (Sgpl1+/−) or wild-type (Sgpl1+/+)
embryos. First, loss of SPL caused resistance to the toxic
effects of etoposide and doxorubicin. Interestingly, heterozygosity for the Sgpl1 gene resulted in partial resistance to apoptosis. Secondly, doxorubicin-induced apoptotic signaling
was strongly inhibited in Sgpl1−/− cells (phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase activation, and cytochrome c release).
This was accompanied by a strong increase in Bcl-2 and BclxL protein content. Whereas correction of SPL deficiency in
Sgpl1−/− cells led to downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins,
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown
in SPL-deficient cells resulted in increased sensitivity to doxorubicin, suggesting that Bcl-2 upregulation mediates SPL protective effects. Moreover, SPL deficiency led to increased cell
proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and formation of tumors in nude mice. Finally, transcriptomic studies
showed that SPL expression is downregulated in human melanoma cell lines. Thus, by affecting S1P metabolism and the
expression of Bcl-2 members, the loss of SPL enhances cell resistance to anticancer regimens and results in an increased
ability of cells to acquire a transformed phenotype and become malignant. [Cancer Res 2009;69(24):9346–53]

Introduction
Sphingolipids are essential ubiquitous constituents of membranes and, notably, microdomains (1). However, like mediators
derived from glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids are a source of

an important family of bioactive signaling molecules that regulate
numerous physiologic and pathologic processes (2). The importance of sphingolipids in human health and disease is illustrated
by the dramatic consequences of inherited disruption of their normal metabolism (3) and also by their involvement as bioeffector
molecules in cancer and hematologic malignancies (4–6). The best
characterized sphingolipid mediators are ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P): whereas ceramide generally transduces
antiproliferative responses, the lysolipid S1P has crucial roles in
cell survival, cell migration, and angiogenesis and as well as immune responses (7).
S1P exerts its effects either through autocrine and paracrine actions as a ligand for a family of specific G protein–coupled receptors (S1P1-5) as well as by intracellular functions as a second
messenger involved in the control of cell growth and death signaling pathways (8, 9). Both intracellular and circulating levels of S1P
depend on the activity of some membrane transporters and of
three classes of enzymes that control its metabolism. Whereas
sphingosine kinases 1 (SK1) and 2 produce S1P by phosphorylating
sphingosine, two S1P phosphatases dephosphorylate S1P to generate sphingosine, and S1P lyase (SPL) irreversibly degrades S1P to
phosphoethanolamine and 2-trans hexadecenal (10). The critical
role played by S1P as a “tumor-promoting” agent has been mostly
evidenced through manipulation of the expression and biological
activity of SK1. Indeed, SK1 is overexpressed in multiple types of
cancers and upregulation of SK1 has been associated with tumor
angiogenesis and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Conversely, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of SK1 activity in vitro
on different cultured tumor cell models and in vivo on transplanted
animals has been shown to enhance drug-induced lethality (11, 12).
Furthermore, S1P-generating enzyme SK1 acts as an oncogene
because NIH3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing SK1 acquired a transformed phenotype and the capability to form tumors in nude
mice (13).
Of the enzymes involved in determining S1P abundance, SPL represents an undeniable candidate as potential regulator of cell's
fate in response to stress (14). SPL is a microsomal pyridoxal 5′phosphate–dependent aldehyde-lyase that catalyzes the irreversible cleavage of S1P in the final step of sphingolipid catabolism
(15, 16). In mammalian cells, overexpression of SPL was shown
to sensitize cells to apoptotic stress such as serum deprivation
and chemotherapy (17–19). SPL-induced apoptosis requires its enzyme activity and can be blocked by addition of exogenous S1P
(17). In contrast, products of the lyase reaction had no effect on
apoptosis. The cytotoxic effect of SPL appears to be dependent
on the activation of proapoptotic signaling pathways involving

(19). However, whereas SK1 overexpression was associated with
upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (20, 21), the connection between SPL with Bcl-2 family members has never been
investigated.
Interestingly, the SGPL1 gene, which encodes SPL, has been reported to be significantly downregulated in human colon cancer
tissues compared with normal tissues (22). Moreover, the human
SGPL1 gene maps to chromosomal region 10q21 (23), which is deleted or mutated in many human tumor types (24–26). Altogether,
these observations suggest that loss of SPL expression might potentiate cancer cell proliferation and contribute to tumorigenesis;
this, however, remains to be demonstrated.
Here, we report that the lack of SPL leads to upregulation of the
antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and consequently protects
against apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents but not autophagy. Moreover, SPL-deficient cells isolated from Sgpl1−/−
mouse embryos showed an increase in cell growth rate in culture,
colony formation in soft agar, and tumor progression in nude mice
compared with cells isolated from wild-type embryos. Collectively,
this study suggests that SPL behaves as a tumor suppressor and
may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and genotyping. Sgpl1 +/− mice were generated from
OST58278 (27) gene-trapped ES cells, bought from OmniBank, by Lexicon
Genetics on a fee basis, and inbred into a C57BL/6 background as reported
(28).6 Heterozygous mice were mated and murine embryonic fibroblasts

(MEF) were prepared at embryonic day 16 from the skin of wild-type
(Sgpl1+/+), SPL heterozygous (Sgpl1+/−), and SPL-deficient (Sgpl1−/−) embryos. By dilution culturing, spontaneously immortalized MEFs were obtained.
Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen) at 37°C in 5%
CO2 humidified incubators. Total genomic DNA was extracted and quantified using the Nanodrop ND-1000. Fragments derived from the β-geo and
Sgpl1 sequences were amplified by duplex PCR using the following primers:
Gal-2s 5′-CgAATACCTgTTCCgTCATAgC, Gal-2r 5′-ACCACTACCATCATCAATCCggTAg, MmSPL-Trap-s 5′-TgATAgggCTgAAAACCACTg, and
MmSPL-Trap-r 5′-TCAgAAgCAAAACTgCCTTg. Amplification was carried
out for 35 cycles using an annealing temperature of 60°C. DNA fragments
were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Vectors and cell transfections. The cDNA encoding mSPL (29) was
amplified by PCR using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and oligonucleotides matching the first and last bases, respectively, of the Sgpl1 sequence
and containing AflII and XhoI restriction sites. The amplification product
was cloned in the pcDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen) and its sequence was
verified. Then, SPL-deficient cells were transfected with the pcDNA5TOmSPL vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Transient interference was achieved by a pool of four small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) specific for SPL, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool; Dharmacon) or aleatory sequence scrambled siRNA. siRNA targeting
SPL or Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were transfected into wild-type or Sgpl1−/− MEFs,
respectively, grown to 70% to 90% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000.
After 48 h of transfection, doxorubicin was added to the medium and incubated for 24 h before evaluation of cell viability.
Cell viability, flow cytometry, and morphologic analyses. For cytotoxicity assays, cells were seeded in flat-bottomed 24-well plates (4 × 105 per
well). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5%
FCS and etoposide or doxorubicin, and cells were incubated at 37°C for different times. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay (Euromedex).
Phosphatidylserine externalization was evaluated by flow cytometry
after labeling with Annexin V-FITC (250 ng/mL) and propidium iodide
(12.5 μg/mL; AbCys) using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) cytometer.

For analysis of cytochrome c release, cells seeded on glass coverslips at
2 × 104/mL were incubated with doxorubicin, fixed with formaldehyde (4%),
washed with PBS, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%), and stained with
a monoclonal anti–cytochrome c antibody (BD Pharmingen) and a secondary Alexa 488–labeled antibody (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen).
DEVD cleavage enzyme assay. Cell lysates were incubated for 30 min
with Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Alexis). The amount of
the released fluorescent product was determined fluorometrically at 351
and 430 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford method.
Western blot analyses. Equal amounts of proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Perkin-Elmer), and blotted with monoclonal anti–caspase-3,
anti–caspase-9, anti–Bcl-xL, polyclonal anti–caspase-7, anti-Bid or polyclonal
anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and anti–β-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Polyclonal anti-Bax and anti–Bcl-2 antibodies were from BD
Pharmingen. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system (Pierce). SPL was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antimouse SPL antibody kindly provided by Drs. M. Ikeda and A. Kihara.
SPL assay. SPL enzyme activity was determined on cell lysates using
3
D-erythro-[4,5- H]dihydro-S1P (ARC/Isobio) as described (30).
S1P measurements. The amount of cellular S1P was evaluated as reported (31) using D-erythro-[3-3H]sphingosine (0.45 μCi/mL; 1.5 μmol/L;
Perkin-Elmer).
Anchorage-independent growth assay. Six-well plates were precoated
with 2 mL DMEM containing 10% FCS and 0.6% agar. DMEM (2 mL) contain-

ing 10% FCS, 0.3% agar, and 5,000 cells were overlaid onto the precoated
wells. After 2 weeks' incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere, cell colonies
were visualized by MTT staining (500 μg/mL) and photographed.
Tumor growth (allograft mouse models). Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− cells
were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended at 5 × 106/mL in sterile PBS.
One hundred microliters were injected s.c. into the flank of 4-week-old female
nude mice (NMRI-nu; Janvier) and tumors were allowed to develop for up to
40 days. Tumor volumes were calculated as described (32). All experiments
were done in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by
INSERM and were approved by the local animal care and use committee.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Nonconfluent human melanoma cell lines
(American Type Culture Collection) and normal epidermal melanocytes
(derived from adult skin NHEM-M2 or juvenile foreskin NHEM-f; PromoCell) were harvested and RNA was extracted (RNeasy kit; Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer's protocol and treated with DNase (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by automated gel electrophoresis (Experion; Bio-Rad). RNA
(2 μg) was reverse-transcribed (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) and used as a
template for quantitative PCR. The reactions were done in duplicate on
the StepOne instrument (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR kit
and primer assay (QuantiTect; Qiagen). The results were quantified using
the system software. mRNA of TBP, TFRC, and β-actin were analyzed for
normalization.
Statistical analyses. Results are expressed as mean ± SE. Student's t test
was used for statistical comparisons among groups and differences were
considered statistically significant when P < 0.05 (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01;
***, P < 0.001).

Results
Gene dosage effect of Sgpl1 on cell death induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. To address the effect of SPL deficiency on anticancer drug–induced cell death, we first used a genetic approach
by testing mutant MEFs derived from heterozygous (Sgpl1+/−) and
homozygous (Sgpl1−/−) SPL-null mouse embryos. Sgpl1+/− and
Sgpl1−/− cells carry a β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion gene trap
cassette within the second intron of the Sgpl1 gene (Fig. 1A). Only
in these mutant cells bacterial β-galactosidase activity was
measurable (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, Western blot
analysis using an antibody raised against the murine SPL protein
(Fig. 1B) and SPL enzymatic assay (Fig. 1C) confirmed that SPL
expression and activity were decreased in Sgpl1+/− cells and abolished in Sgpl1−/− cells compared with wild-type cells. Disruption
of Sgpl1 gene was accompanied by an intracellular increase of
S1P levels (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Table S1).
The importance of SPL in stress-induced cell death was investigated by treating wild-type and SPL mutant cells with various concentrations of etoposide (Fig. 2A) and doxorubicin (Fig. 2B). These
agents led to a dose- and time-dependent reduction in the viability
of Sgpl1+/+ cells (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Under all concentrations tested, Sgpl1+/− MEFs were significantly less sensitive
to the lethal effects of the drugs than their normal counterparts,
whereas Sgpl1−/− MEFs were highly resistant. Interestingly, the
chemoresistance of heterozygous and homozygous cells was also
observed in primary MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S3) as well as
SV40-transformed MEFs (data not shown). Furthermore, nuclear
condensation observed in doxorubicin-treated Sgpl1+/+ cells by fluorescence microscopy was reduced in Sgpl1+/− and completely abolished in Sgpl1−/− cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Finally, Sgpl1+/+
MEFs transfected with a siRNA targeting SPL, which reduced SPL

www.aacrjournals.org

protein content by ∼50%, became partially resistant to doxorubicin
(Fig. 2D). Similar observations were made on NIH3T3 fibroblasts
treated with mSPL siRNA (data not shown). These data point to a
strong correlation between SPL expression and cell sensitivity to
chemotherapy.
SPL is required for apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. To
substantiate the importance of SPL in anticancer drug–induced
cell death, the apoptotic cascade activated by doxorubicin in
Sgpl1 −/− cells was analyzed. Of note, intracellular uptake of
doxorubicin, analyzed by fluorometry, was similar in Sgpl1+/+
and Sgpl1−/− cells (data not shown but illustrated in Fig. 3D by
the red fluorescence of the nuclei). In wild-type but not in SPLdeficient cells, doxorubicin led to an increased proportion of
Annexin V–positive and propidium iodide–negative cells, cells with
externalized phosphatidylserine (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with the absence of morphologic alterations such as nuclear
condensation observed in mutant cells compared with control cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) and suggest that apoptosis is impaired in
SPL-deficient cells.
To test whether caspase activation was altered in SPL mutant
cells upon doxorubicin treatment, we analyzed caspase activity
by measuring cleavage of the fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate
Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin. Caspase activity
(Fig. 3B) and processing of caspase-3 and caspase-7 as well as
the cleavage of caspase-9 and the caspase substrate poly(ADPribose) polymerase (Fig. 3C) were strongly impaired in SPLdeficient cells following doxorubicin treatment. As shown in
Fig. 3D, translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the
cytosol was also blocked in Sgpl1−/− cells, showing the involvement
of SPL in the apoptotic cascade initiated by doxorubicin with a site
of action likely lying upstream of mitochondria.

Autophagy is not altered in Sgpl1−/− cells. As the increase of
S1P levels after SK1 overexpression was shown to stimulate autophagy and to protect cells from apoptotic death during nutrient
starvation (33), we examined the effect of SPL deficiency on this
phenomenon. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S4, starvationinduced apoptosis was reduced in Sgpl1−/− compared with Sgpl1+/+
cells. However, autophagy, monitored by measuring proteolysis of
long-lived proteins, formation of LC3-II or LC3 translocation from
the cytosol to aggregates into autophagic vacuoles, which are
prerequisites for autophagosome formation and are regarded as
autophagy markers (34, 35), was similar in wild-type and mutant
cells. These data suggest that, under nutrient starvation, the resistance of SPL-deficient cells to apoptosis is not associated with alterations in autophagy.
Upregulation of the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members contributes to the chemoresistance of SPL-deficient
cells. Overexpression of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins occurs in numerous tumors and correlates with resistance to antineoplastic
drugs (36). To determine whether resistance to doxorubicin of
SPL-deficient cells was accompanied with an alteration of the
balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the
Bcl-2 family, the expression pattern of these proteins was investigated. A comparative Western blot analysis revealed that Sgpl1−/−
cells displayed higher levels of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL than Sgpl1+/+
cells, whereas Bid and Bax were not modified, indicating a possible
contribution of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic members to the chemoresistance of SPL-deficient cells (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S3C). To

test the latter hypothesis, we investigated the expression of Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL in Sgpl1−/− cells transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding mSPL. As shown in Fig. 4B, SPL-corrected Sgpl1−/− cells displayed lower levels of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL than mutant cells
transiently transfected with an empty vector. We next employed
a knockdown approach to deplete Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL either individually or in combination in Sgpl1−/− cells. Effective downregulation
of the target protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL was confirmed by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 4C). Sgpl1−/− cells transfected with both Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL siRNA displayed enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin
compared with their control counterparts (Fig. 4D). Collectively,
these data point to a tight regulation between the expression of
Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins and SPL in the control of sensitivity
to chemotherapeutic drugs.
Lack of SPL expression leads to increased cell proliferation
in vitro and oncogenesis in vivo. The S1P-generating enzyme SK1
behaves as an oncogene when overexpressed in nontransformed
NIH3T3 fibroblasts (13). To investigate the effect of S1P-degrading
SPL on cell transformation, we analyzed the growth properties of
Sgpl1−/− and Sgpl1+/+ cells. We found that, in serum-free medium or
in the presence of 1% serum, SPL-deficient cells exhibited higher
rates of proliferation than their wild-type counterparts. In S1P-containing medium, full serum, both cell lines grew at identical rates
(Fig. 5A). However, using the scratch wound closure assay, we observed that cell migration was not altered in SPL-deficient cells
(data not shown). We then tested whether increased growth of
Sgpl1−/− cells was accompanied by the ability to form colonies in

using the MTT test. Mean ± SE of three

SPL-deficient cells gave rise to numerous colonies, whereas wildtype cells showed much less anchorage-independent growth. To
evaluate the in vivo transforming properties of SPL, we tested
the ability of Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− cells to grow in immunocompromised mice. When injected s.c. in female athymic nude mice, SPLdeficient cells induced rapidly growing tumors at the site of
inoculation within 15 days, whereas mice grafted with Sgpl1+/+ cells
did not develop tumors even 40 days postgraft (Fig. 5C). In all
tumor-bearing mice sacrificed after 40 days, the bacterial β-galac-

tosidase carried in the gene trap was fully active (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Histologic analysis showed that all tumors presented high
cellularity and consisted of spindle cells, some with atypical nuclei,
forming fascicles highly suggestive of a fibrosarcoma (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Altogether, these data indicate that expression of a
functional SPL is required for inhibition of tumorigenesis.

SGPL1 gene maps to chromosomal 10q21 and that alteration of
chromosome 10 is common in human cancers including melanoma (37), we evaluated the expression of SPL in a series of invasive
or metastatic melanoma cells and compared with that of melanocytes derived from healthy individuals. As shown in Fig. 6, SGPL1
expression was significantly reduced in most melanoma cell lines
tested, suggesting that this gene is downregulated during melanoma tumorigenesis.

Discussion
S1P is considered as a tumor-promoting agent for its role in the
regulation of cancer cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration,
metastatic potential, and angiogenesis (2, 7). Several antitumoral
therapeutic approaches targeting S1P formation and signaling
have been developed including the synthesis of sphingosine kinase
inhibitors (38), the targeting of S1P receptors with the immunosuppressant FTY720 (39), and the use of an anti-S1P antibody (40). By
controlling S1P catabolism, SPL emerges as a novel target in the
generation of sphingolipid-based therapeutics (14).
Analysis of SPL-deficient genetic models revealed that SPL is
crucial for mammalian survival because SPL knockout mice displayed severe lymphopenia and developed myeloid cell hyperplasia
and also significant lesions in several nonlymphoid organs (28, 41).
Here, using fibroblasts generated from SPL-deficient mouse embryos, we show that complete loss of SPL activity confers resistance to
apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents. Of particular
interest was the finding that a gene dosage effect exists in the sensitivity to anticancer drugs because the loss of a single SPL allele
(as seen in heterozygous cells) resulted in partial resistance to genotoxic stress. This observation was corroborated by the fact that
siRNA-mediated knockdown of SPL in control fibroblasts also led
to a partial resistance to doxorubicin-induced cell death. SPL deficiency blocked apoptotic events such as the cleavage of effector
caspases and the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
in accordance with data showing that caspase-3 activity was increased in SPL-overexpressing cells (17, 19). Moreover, we found
that the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol
and the cleavage of initiator caspase-9 were impaired in Sgpl1−/−
cells, suggesting that SPL likely acts upstream of mitochondria
and triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Several Bcl-2 family proteins insert into mitochondrial membranes operating as guardians of these organelles (42). Here, we
show that whereas loss of SPL activity contributes to upregulation
of the oncoproteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL but not Bax and Bid, its restoration in SPL-deficient cells was able to diminish their expression. Moreover, double knockdown of Bcl-2 and its homologue
Bcl-xL could sensibilize Sgpl1−/− cells to the cytotoxic effect of
doxorubicin. These findings identify SPL as an upstream regulator
of the oncoproteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL that control the mitochondrial cell death pathway. They are consistent with the notion that S1P
metabolism is tightly connected to the expression of Bcl-2 members. Indeed, whereas the prosurvival effect of S1P-generating enzyme SK1 has been associated with upregulation of antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins (21, 43), its pharmacologic inhibition resulted in
cleavage of Bcl-2, a response linked to mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis (38).
Bcl-2-family proteins are also capable of regulating macroautophagy by interacting with the autophagy protein Beclin 1 (44). In
Sgpl1−/− cells, neither the expression of Beclin-1 (data not shown)
nor nutrient starvation-induced autophagy were altered. These re-

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (24). December 15, 2009

sults suggest that Bcl-2 overexpression does not blunt the autophagic response in Sgpl1−/− cells and that autophagy cannot account
for the resistance of Sgpl1−/− cells to starvation-induced apoptosis.
All antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members are oncoproteins and
the oncogenic potential of Bcl-2 was first illustrated through its
transcriptional deregulation in human follicular lymphoma (45).
However, although high levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL are often associated with a more aggressive malignant phenotype and mice bearing a modified Bcl-2 transgene develop spontaneous lymphoid
tumors, Bcl-2 overexpression on its own is not highly oncogenic
but requires synergistic pretumorigenic lesions to increase the likelihood of malignancy (46). The present study provides evidence
that combined effects of SPL loss and Bcl-2 overexpression in
Sgpl1−/− immortalized cells contribute to their ability to form colonies in soft agar and to generate solid tumors when implanted
into nude mice. SPL expression may also repress cellular transformation and antagonize the oncogenic effect of the S1P-generating
enzyme SK1 (13). However, whether loss of SPL affects the expression of other oncoproteins cannot be excluded. For instance, it
has been shown that SPL promotes apoptosis via a p53-dependent pathway (19). The tumor suppressor p53 has been also associated to Bcl-2 because it could inactivate its antiapoptotic
functions by promoting its phosphorylation (47). Moreover, p53
is inactivated in many cancers mostly through missense mutations that result in the abrogation of its activity and the acquisition of oncogenic functions (48).
S1P metabolism has also been linked to the oncogenic Rasmediated transformation because the S1P-generating enzyme SK1
was activated in NIH3T3 cells transfected with an active mutant of
Ras, whereas the transforming ability of Ras was inhibited in cells
cotransfected with a dominant-negative mutant of SK1 (13). Interestingly, activation of the Ras pathway resulted in the rapid upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (49), and Bcl-2 and Ras mutant cooperated
to give rise to malignant disease (50). Future studies are necessary to
determine whether SPL loss and Bcl-2 overexpression are causally
related to the Ras pathway or the expression of other oncogenes.
Our data show that reduced SPL activity results in both resistance to apoptosis and oncogenesis, suggesting that SPL could restrict tumor development. The reduced expression of SPL in solid
cancers would go along such a tumor suppressor role. Indeed, we
observed that SGPL1 expression is downregulated in human
melanoma. This finding is consistent with the diminished SPL expression reported on human colorectal carcinomas (19). A more
in-depth analysis of the molecular mechanisms that regulate SPL
expression and its effects are required to better understand its
role in S1P-mediated oncogenesis.
