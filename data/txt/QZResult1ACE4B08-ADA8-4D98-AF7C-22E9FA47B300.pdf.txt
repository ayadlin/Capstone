Abstract

Inactivation of APC is a strongly predisposing event in the development of colorectal cancer1,2,
prompting us to search for vulnerabilities specific to cells that have lost APC function. Signalling
through the mTOR pathway is known to be required for epithelial cell proliferation and tumour
growth3-5 and the current paradigm suggests that a critical function of mTOR activity is to
upregulate translational initiation through phosphorylation of 4EBP16,7. This model predicts that
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which does not efficiently inhibit 4EBP18, would be ineffective in
limiting cancer progression in APC deficient lesions. Here we show that mTORC1 activity is
absolutely required for the proliferation of APC deficient (but not wild type) enterocytes,
revealing an unexpected opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although APC deficient cells
show the expected increases in protein synthesis, our studies reveals that it is translation
elongation, and not initiation, which is the rate-limiting component. Mechanistically, mTORC1
mediated inhibition of eEF2 kinase is required for the proliferation of APC deficient cells.
Importantly, treatment of established APC deficient adenomas with rapamycin (which can target
eEF2 through the mTORC1 – S6K – eEF2K axis) causes tumour cells to undergo growth arrest

The ability of the intestinal epithelium to regenerate following challenge has been well
described9-11. We have shown that this is a Wnt-driven process that mimics the proliferation
observed following Apc deletion11,12 and is a valuable model of the early stages of intestinal
cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling these processes are largely
unknown. The serine/threonine kinase mTOR, particularly the mTOR Complex 1
(mTORC1), is a known mediator of cell growth and proliferation13. Previous studies have
suggested that mTORC1 may be important in both the intestinal stem-cell niche and for
intestinal tumourigenesis4,5,14. We therefore queried the role of mTORC1 in intestinal
proliferation following Wnt activation. Following Apc deletion there was an increase in the
phosphorylation status of mTORC1 effectors rpS6 and 4EBP1 that was dependent on MYC
expression. Increased phosphorylation of these proteins was also seen during crypt
regeneration (Fig. 1a,b,c, Extended Data Fig. 1a). Importantly, the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin blocked intestinal regeneration, demonstrating that mTOR signalling is required
for this process (Fig. 1d,e). Given that rapamycin did not affect apoptosis nor proliferation in
the normal intestine (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c), these data suggest that there may be a
potential therapeutic window, between normal intestinal enterocytes and those with a high
level of Wnt activity. Therefore Raptor (an essential component of mTORC1) was deleted in
the intestinal epithelium (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Surprisingly, normal gut homeostasis was
unaffected by Raptor loss 4 days post-Cre induction, when using an epithelium-specific CreRecombinase (VillinCREER Rptorfl/fl) (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Furthermore, 400 days after
induction, no phosphorylation of rpS6 or 4EBP1 was observed, showing that Raptor deletion
was sustained (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Raptor loss caused no change in either levels of
mitosis or apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c) but proved to be essential for the proliferative
phenotype observed during regeneration or following Apc deletion (Fig. 1a,b,d,e,f). Nuclear
localisation of β-catenin and high levels of MYC could be demonstrated by IHC, showing
that Wnt-activation is still present (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).
Given that rapamycin treatment and Raptor deletion had similar effects, we examined
whether rapamycin treatment was sufficient to modify intestinal tumourigenesis, either
prophylactically, or chemotherapeutically. First we assessed whether rapamycin could
suppress a model of intestinal tumourigenesis, in which Apc deletion is targeted to LGR5positive stem cells using the LGR5CREER (LGR5CREER Apcfl/fl). Mice were treated starting
10 days post-Cre induction, and in contrast to controls, remained tumour free for the
duration of the experiment (Fig. 2a,b). Next we treated mice (ApcMin/+ or LGR5CREER
Apcfl/fl) with established adenomas. Remarkably, the mice lost their clinical symptoms of
disease and survived significantly longer than controls (Fig. 2c,d; Extended Data Fig. 3c).
We next analysed the tumours from these mice over a time-course post-rapamycin
treatment. Treatment caused a loss of proliferation specifically within the tumours by 72hours, and an increase in the number of Lysozyme-positive paneth cells (Fig. 2e; Extended
Data Fig. 3d,e). By 30 days, most tumours had shrunk considerably to small nonproliferative lesions that no longer contained paneth cells (Fig. 2f; Extended Data Fig. 3f).

Within the normal intestine there are two main cell populations that show high levels of
Wnt-signalling; the label-retaining/progenitor population and the paneth cell population15.
Our data suggest that treatment of mice with rapamycin causes the differentiation of the
tumour’s Wnt-high progenitor cells into the other Wnt-high fate in the intestine; namely
non-proliferative paneth-like cells. The cell-cycle arrest in these cells was examined by
staining for p21, p16, p53. No increase in these markers was observed, suggesting a classical
cell cycle arrest pathway had not been engaged (Extended Data Fig. 4a). We reasoned that if
mice were removed from rapamycin the tumours would regain proliferative capacity.
Indeed, when rapamycin treatment was halted, signs of intestinal neoplasia were observed
approximately 40–60 days later (Extended Data Fig. 3c). This suggested that intestinal
adenoma stem cells were still present. Tumours from LGR5-GFP-CREER mice were stained
to detect LGR5-GFP positivity. We found that following rapamycin treatment, numerous
LGR5-positive cells were still present, indicating that, while rapamycin treatment causes a
regression of the lesions, the tumour initiating cells remain (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

We next examined the mechanism of mTORC1 requirement following Apc loss. mTORC1
is known to regulate protein synthesis on multiple levels and most research has focused on
two downstream effectors: 4EBP1 and S6K. A number of studies have suggested that
translation initiation, via the 4EBP1 – eIF4E axis, is the critical effector of mTOR in
cancer6,16. However, it has been shown that rapamycin preferentially inhibits the
phosphorylation of S6K over 4EBP18, suggesting that 4EBP1-mediated inhibition of
translation initiation may not be limiting in the context of Apc loss. To assess the changes in
translational control in response to mTORC1 inhibition, we measured the polysomal
distribution in WT, Apc-deficient and Apc/Raptor-deficient intestinal epithelial cells 4-days
post gene deletion. Apc deletion resulted in a decrease in the number of polysomes, whereas
Apc/Raptor co-deletion reversed this effect (Fig. 3a). The decrease in the number of
polysomes following Apc deletion could suggest either reduced translation initiation (and
consequently a lower overall level of translation) and/or a faster rate of translational
elongation. Global translation rates were measured using an in vitro intestinal crypt 3dculture model17. The Apc-deficient cells were shown to have increased 35S-labelled
methionine/cysteine incorporation compared to WT, showing higher overall levels of protein
synthesis (Fig. 3b). Unfortunately, Raptor deletion prevented the growth of crypts in vitro so
this could not be assayed (Extended Data Fig. 5).
To measure the rate of translational elongation, an in vitro harringtonine run-off assay was
performed18, as described in Methods. There was a >2.5-fold increase in ribosome run-off in
crypts with Apc deletion compared to wild-type (Fig. 3c; Extended Data Fig. 6a-d). This
suggests that following Wnt activation, elongation, rather than initiation, is rate limiting for
protein synthesis and mTORC1 must be activated to overcome this.
Cycloheximide (an inhibitor of elongation19) reduced proliferation associated with Apc
deletion, to a similar level to rapamycin (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). While cycloheximide is
acknowledged to inhibit elongation19, it must be emphasised that 72hr treatment could result
in broad alterations in protein synthesis. However, the Apcfl/fl-specific loss of proliferation
observed here provides “proof of principle” to demonstrate that modulation of protein
synthesis may be useful as a chemotherapeutic strategy.

As most previous work has suggested translation initiation downstream of 4EBP1 is limiting
to cancer20, it was important to probe known effectors of mTORC1 in this system. Given the
alteration of elongation rates, the elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), a known target of
S6K21,22 was of particular interest. eEF2K is a negative regulator of the elongation factor 2
(eEF2), giving mTORC1 the ability to promote translational elongation via S6K23. Using
multiple mouse knockout and knock-in alleles, we further dissected the downstream
effectors of mTORC1 in intestinal regeneration. S6k1/2 knockout decreased intestinal
regeneration, whilst knockout of Eif4ebp1/2 had no effect. As the 4EBP proteins are
negative regulators of eIF4E, an increase (rather than decrease) in regeneration may have
been predicted, but this was not found. Moreover these intestines were still sensitive to
rapamycin, demonstrating that rapamycin was acting via the mTORC1-S6K branch rather
than 4EBP1-eIF4E (Extended Data Fig. 7). We then used an Eef2k-null mouse and showed
that following irradiation and treatment with rapamycin, these mice were now resistant to
mTORC1 inhibition, confirming the importance of translational elongation (Fig. 4a). To
ensure that S6K was not also acting through its more established effector, rpS6, we used an
rpS6 phospho-mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by S6K. This was unable to phenocopy
Raptor deletion (Fig. 4a), showing that Wnt-driven regeneration requires increased
translational elongation, mediated through mTORC1.
To prove that inhibition of eEF2K by S6K is required to allow increased eEF2 activity
following Apc loss, we intercrossed VillinCREER Apcfl/fl to Eef2k−/− mice and treated these
with rapamycin. In contrast to VillinCREER Apcfl/fl mice, these intestines were now resistant
to growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin (Fig. 4b,c). Tellingly, these mice no longer show
an increase in the inhibitory phosphorylation of eEF2 following rapamycin treatment
(Extended Data Fig. 8).

To assess whether the increased elongation following Apc deletion had differential affects
on cell cycle regulating proteins, RNA and protein levels of several key cell cycle regulators
were tested (Fig. 4d,e). This analysis revealed that whilst there were increased RNA and
protein levels of Cyclin D1, D2, CDK4 and CDK6, Cyclin D3 had increased protein levels
in the absence of increased mRNA levels. Cyclin D3 protein levels were sensitive to
rapamycin exposure, and this sensitivity depends on eEF2K (Extended Data Fig. 9).
Additionally, ribosomes were shown to elongate approximately 4-times faster on Cyclin D3
messages in Apc-deficient cells than WT cells. No differences were detected in other
messages tested (Extended Data Fig. 10). Taken together, these data suggest that Cyclin D3
is translationally regulated at the level of elongation, consistent with previous reports24,25.
The contribution of Cyclin D3 to the proliferative phenotype remains to be elucidated.
In summary, we report that mTORC1 is an essential downstream effector of Wnt-signalling
in the intestine. We show that intestinal proliferation associated with Wnt-signalling requires
the mTORC1 – S6K – eEF2K – eEF2 axis, and that the resulting increase in the rate of
elongation of specific polypeptides overcomes a limiting translational step. Our work
highlights key functional roles for eEF2K and translational elongation in the control of the
initiation of cancer and adenomatous proliferation. The importance of elongation in this
context has been suggested in a small number of publications, but this study provides
definitive in vivo evidence26-28. Finally, we have also shown that targeting mTOR and

translational control may be a viable strategy for chemoprevention of CRC in high risk
patients, and treatment of early stage disease. Indeed, recent studies have suggested that the
chemopreventative agents aspirin and mesalazine also target mTOR29,30.

METHODS

Mouse colonies
All experiments were performed according with UK Home Office regulations (licence
60/4183) which undergoes local ethical review at Glasgow University. Outbred male mice
from 6 to 12 weeks of age were used. The majority of the work was performed on C57BL/6
mice: AhCre, Apcfl/fl, ApcMin/+, Rptorfl/fl, S6k1/2 knockout and Rps6mut mice were all
C57BL/6J. Some treatment experiments were performed on mice that were only three
generations C57BL/6 (Lgr5CreER Apcfl/fl).
The alleles used were as follows: VillinCreER (ref. 31). AhCre (ref. 11), Lgr5CreER (ref. 32),
Apc580 (ref. 33), ApcMin/+ (ref. 34), Mycfl/fl (ref. 35), Rptor fl/fl (ref. 36), ROSA-tdRFP (ref.
37), Eif4ebp1 knockout (ref. 38), Eif4ebp2 knockout (ref. 39), S6k1 knockout (ref. 40), S6k2
knockout (ref. 41), Eef2k knockout (ref. 42), Rps6mut (ref. 43). Recombination by
VillinCreER was induced with one intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 80 mg kg−1 tamoxifen on
day 0 and day 1. Analysis of VillinCreER-induced mice was at day 4 after induction. Red
fluorescent protein (RFP) analysis was carried out by inducing recombination by AhCre
using a single i.p. injection of 80 mg kg−1 β-napthoflavone. RFP visualization was carried
out on day 4. Mice carrying the Lgr5CreER transgene were given one i.p. injection of 120
mg kg−1 tamoxifen.
For regeneration experiments, mice were exposed to γ-irradiation from caesium-137
sources. This delivered γ-irradiation at 0.423 Gy min−1.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Rapamycin treatment was performed using a daily i.p. injection of 10 mg kg−1 (refs 43, 44)
in 5% Tween80 and 5% polyethylene glycol in PBS. Cycloheximide treatment was
performed using a daily i.p. injection of 35 mg kg−1 in PBS.
In accordance with the 3Rs, the smallest sample size was chosen that could give a
significant difference. Given the robust phenotype of the Apcfl/fl, and our prediction that
mTOR was essential, the minimum sample size assuming no overlap in control versus
experimental is three animals.
No randomization was used and the experimenter was blinded to drugs and genotypes.
IHC
Standard IHC techniques were used throughout this study. Antibody concentrations used
were as follows: phospho-rpS6Ser235/236 (1:800; Cell Signaling 4858),
phospho-4EBP1Thr37/46 (1:500; Cell Signaling 2855), phospho-eEF2Thr56 (1:500; Novus

performed on at least three mice of each genotype. Representative images are shown for
each staining.
Assaying apoptosis, mitosis and proliferation in vivo

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Apoptosis and mitotic index were scored from H&E-stained sections as previously
described11. Proliferation levels were assessed by measuring BrdU incorporation. Mice were
injected with 250 μl of BrdU (Amersham Biosciences) 2 h before being killed.
Immunohistochemical staining for BrdU was then performed using an anti-BrdU antibody.
For each analysis, 25 full crypts were scored from at least three mice of each genotype.
Intestinal epithelium extraction
To generate tissue for polysomal profile analysis, 10-cm portions of intestine were flushed
with 0.1 mg ml−1 cycloheximide (Sigma) in PBS and inverted over a glass rod to expose the
epithelial surface. Intestines were incubated in 0.1 mg ml−1 cycloheximide in HBSS (Gibco)
with 10 mM EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C followed by 5 min of vigorous shaking. Intestines
were transferred to 0.1 mg ml−1 cycloheximide in PBS and incubated for a further 5 min at 4
°C, followed by 5 min of vigorous shaking. This fraction contained intestinal crypts and was
used for downstream analysis.
Sucrose density ultracentrifugation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Intestinal epithelial cells were lysed in ice-cold 300 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 15 mM Tris
(pH 7.5) containing 500 units ml−1 RNAsin, 1 mg ml−1 heparin sulphate and 0.1 mg ml−1
cycloheximide supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Post-nuclear lysates were
layered on 10 ml 10–50% (w/v) sucrose gradients of the same buffer omitting Triton X-100.
Gradients were centrifuged at 38,000 r.p.m. for 2 h at 4 °C in a SW40Ti rotor (Beckman
Coulter) and separated through a live OD254nm ultraviolet spectrometer (Isco). Comparison
of peak abundance was based on the area under the curve.
Crypt culture
Mouse small intestines were opened longitudinally and washed with PBS. Crypts were
isolated as previously described17. Isolated crypts were mixed with 50 μl of Matrigel (BD
Bioscence), plated in 24-well plates in Advanced DMEM/F12 with Noggin (100 ng ml−1,
Peprotech). Wild-type crypts were also supplemented with R-spondin (500 ng ml−1; R&D
Systems). Growth factors were added every other day. Sphere formation was scored 7 days
after plating, by counting the number of spheres present per well.
Determination of protein synthesis rates
Cells were treated with 30 μCi ml−1 35S-methionine label (Hartmann Analytic) for 30 min
then harvested and lysed. Protein was precipitated onto filter paper (Whatmann) by addition
of trichloroacetic acid to 12.5% and washed with 70% ethanol then acetone. Scintillation
was read from dried filter paper in triplicate for each experimental condition (National
Diagnostics). Total protein content was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
(Pierce) for standardization between conditions.

Harringtonine run-off assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Harringtonine inhibits de novo translational initiation, allowing ribosomes engaged in
elongation to run-off their messages while limiting re-initiation post-termination.
Harringtonine was added for 0 or 180 s and the increase in sub-polysomes relative to
polysomes was calculated. This run-off rate represents the shift in S:P between the two time
points, which is proportional to elongation speed. Crypt cultures were treated with 2 μg ml−1
Harringtonine (Insight Biotechnology) and at set time periods (0 and 180 s) 0.1 mg ml−1
cycloheximide was added. Cells were scraped into PBS at 4 °C and prepared for sucrose
gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described.
Western blotting
Snap-frozen intestinal epithelial tissue (50–100 mg) was homogenized using the Precellys
24 (Stretton Scientific) in 500 μl of Ripa-lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were
determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of cellular protein (30
μg) were separated on a 4–12% gradient gel (Novex) and subsequently transferred to a
PVDF membrane (Amersham). Total protein was visualized with Poinceau (Sigma). After
blocking the membranes in TBS containing 5% BSA (Sigma), 0.02% Triton X-100 for 1 h,
primary antibodies were added in block solution at the following dilutions: CDK4 (Santa
Cruz SC-260, 1:1,000), CDK6 (Cell Signaling 3136, 1:1,000), cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling
2926, 1:2,000), cyclin D2 (Cell Signaling 3741, 1:1,000), cyclin D3 (Cell Signaling 2936,
1:2,000), eEF2K (Cell Signaling 3692, 1:1,000) and β-actin (Sigma A2228, 1:5,000). After
washing, the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary goat antibodies (Dako) were added
diluted 1:10,000 in block for 1 h. Antibody binding was detected using ECL Western
Blotting Substrate (Pierce). Primary antibody incubations were carried out at 4 °C overnight.
Remaining incubations were carried out at room temperature.

RNA isolation
Snap-frozen intestinal epithelial tissue was homogenized and RNA was extracted using the
TRIzol method (Ambion).
qPCR
One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a Quantitect Reverse
Transcription Kit (Qiagen) in a reaction volume of 20 μl. qPCR was performed on each
sample in triplicate in a 20 μl reaction mixture containing 10 μl of 2× DyNAmo HS master
mix (Thermo Scientific), 0.5 μM of each of the primers (detailed later) and 2 μl cDNA
generated previously. The reaction mixture without a template was run in triplicate as a
control. The reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of
three steps consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, primer annealing at 60 °C for 30 s,
and primer extension at 72 °C for 30 s. A melting curve analysis was performed from 70 °C
to 95 °C in 0.3 °C intervals. Gapdh was used to normalize for differences in RNA input.

Extended Data Fig. 7. S6k deletion decreases intestinal regeneration

Graphical representation of findings, and boxplot showing that murine intestinal
regeneration following irradiation is dependent on S6K. Animals were exposed to 14Gy γirradiation, and intestinal regeneration was calculated 72hrs after exposure by counting the
number of viable crypts and multiplying that by the average size of the regenerating crypts.
Relative regeneration was calculated by comparing each group to WT regeneration.
Rapamycin treatment arm is reproduced from Fig.4 for visual clarity. Whiskers are max and
min, black line is median (n=6 per group, *p-value=0.034, Mann Whitney U test).

harringtonine to ex vivo crypts from wild-type and Apc deleted mice. Harringtonine was
added for 0 or 180 seconds and the increase in sub-polysomes (S) relative to polysome (P)
calculated. This run-off rate represents the shift in S:P between the two time points, which is
proportional to elongation speed. Data are average ± s.e.m. (n=3 biological replicates per
