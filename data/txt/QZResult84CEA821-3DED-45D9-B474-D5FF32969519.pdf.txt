BACKGROUND. Cisplatin-based therapy is standard in patients with advanced
urothelial carcinoma but a large proportion are ineligible due to renal impairment. The safety and activity of a dose-dense carboplatin-based regimen in this
patient population were explored.

METHODS. Patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who were ineligible for
cisplatin were eligible based on at least 1 of the following: 1) serum creatinine
>1.5 mg/dL; 2) creatinine clearance of >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and <60 mL/min/

RESULTS. Twenty-five patients were treated. Myelosuppression was the major toxicity, with 28% of patients experiencing grade 3–4 neutropenia; there were only 2
(8%) episodes of febrile neutropenia. Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities were
infrequent with the exception of grade 3 thrombotic episodes in 4 (16%)

U

rothelial carcinoma (UC) is a chemosensitive neoplasm. With
the use of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, approximately 55% of patients with advanced disease will achieve a major
response, with complete responses in approximately 12% of
patients. Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients with UC are
ineligible for cisplatin due to impaired renal function and/or medical comorbidities.1 Safe and active treatment regimens are needed
for this patient population.
The doublet of gemcitabine plus carboplatin has been extensively studied in patients with UC and impaired renal function.2–6

Whereas this regimen has become widely utilized,
randomized Phase II data suggest the inferiority of
conventional carboplatin-based therapy compared
with cisplatin-based therapy.7–9 Attempts to improve
outcomes have included adding additional active
drugs in standard triplets and quadruplets as a
means of overcoming intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy. However, this schedule of administration
may not be optimal given the expected degree of
overlapping myelosuppression which ultimately
compromises the deliverable dose of each agent.
A novel approach to administering multiagent
chemotherapy is based on the Norton-Simon model.10
This model predicts that cytotoxic agents are most
effective when administered at the shortest possible
retreatment interval (to minimize tumor regrowth
between cycles) and that this ‘dose-density’ is best
achieved with a sequential schedule of administration. This approach also allows each agent to be
administered at an adequate dose. Dose-dense chemotherapy has been well studied in breast cancer, where it
has been shown to improve survival in the adjuvant
setting.11 Our prior experience has demonstrated the
feasibility of this approach in patients with UC and normal renal function.12 To extend this concept to patients
with impaired renal function, we completed a pilot
study to define the optimal dose and schedule of a regimen consisting of doxorubicin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel,
and carboplatin.13 The current study explores the safety
and activity of this regimen in a cohort of cisplatinineligible patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Chemotherapy-naive patients with measurable/evaluable advanced UC were eligible for enrollment. Patients
were required to have impaired renal function defined
as at least 1 of the following: 1) serum creatinine >1.5
mg/dL; 2) calculated creatinine clearance of >30 mL/
min/1.73 m2 and <60 mL/min/1.73 m2; and/or 3) prior
nephrectomy. Creatinine clearance was calculated by
the formula of Cockroft and Gault.14
Measurable disease was defined as bidimensionally measurable tumors by chest radiograph, cross
sectional imaging, or physical examination. Evaluable
disease was restricted to patients with unresectable
(T4) bladder tumors that could be evaluated by cystoscopy and examination under anesthesia (EUA). All
patients were required to be a minimum of 18 years
old and to have a minimum Karnofsky Performance
Status (KPS) of 60%. Other eligibility criteria included:
neutrophil count 1500 cells/mm3, platelet count
150,000 cells/mm3, total bilirubin 1.5 times normal,

alkaline phosphatase <2 times normal, and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) <2 times normal. Normal cardiac function as judged by chest radiography, electrocardiogram, and radionuclide left ventriculogram or
echocardiogram was required. Patients who had evidence of New York Heart Association functional class
III or IV heart disease or severe arrhythmias were
excluded. Patients were not eligible if they had
received any prior systemic chemotherapy or irradiation to the bladder. The Memorial Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the trial and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient
before enrollment. Patients were enrolled on Protocol
97–114 from March 19998 until December 2004.

Pretreatment Evaluation
Baseline evaluation included a history and physical
examination, complete blood count (CBC), serum
chemistries, and electrocardiogram. Additional pretreatment studies included radionuclide left ventriculogram or echocardiogram, chest x-ray, and urinalysis.
All patients underwent baseline cross-sectional imaging including a computed tomography (CT) scan or
magnetic resonance imaging scan of the abdomen
and pelvis. In addition, a CT scan of the chest and
bone scan were performed if clinically indicated. An
EUA and cystoscopy were performed in patients with
clinical T4NXM0 disease.
Treatment Plan
Patients received treatment with sequential doublets
of doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 administered by intravenous (i.v.) infusion plus gemcitabine 2000 mg/m2
administered i.v. every other week  5 cycles followed by paclitaxel 65 mg/m2 i.v. plus carboplatin
AUC 1.7 i.v. weekly  12 cycles. Prophylactic
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim or
pegfilgrastim) was administered after each cycle of
doxorubicin plus gemcitabine. Antiemetic therapy
was administered according to institutional guidelines. Patients were given 20 mg of dexamethasone
orally 14 and 7 hours before receiving the first 2
doses of paclitaxel. The dose was subsequently
decreased to 8 mg administered 7 hours before each
subsequent dose of paclitaxel.
Toxicity/Dose Modifications
Toxicity assessments were performed on the day of
each treatment using the Common Toxicity Criteria
(CTC) of the National Cancer Institute in effect at the
commencement of the trial but with revision of the
CTC (to v. 3.0) during the conduct of the trial. Delays
and dose attenuations were prescribed for specific
toxicities. Dose modifications for the doxorubicin

Dose-Dense Sequential Chemotherapy/Galsky et al.

plus gemcitabine portion of treatment were as follows: if on the scheduled day of chemotherapy
administration the absolute neutrophil count was
<1000 cells/mm3 or the platelet count was <100,000
cells/mm3, doxorubicin plus gemcitabine was delayed for 1 week. If blood counts remained unsatisfactory after 2 1-week delays the patient was
removed from the protocol. In the event of neutropenic fever, subsequent doses of gemcitabine were
reduced by 25% with no change in the doxorubicin
dose. Doxorubicin was to be discontinued in the setting of congestive heart failure, persistent arrhythmia, or an increase in heart size by 50% on chest
radiograph. In the event of grade 2 mucositis, dysphagia, or diarrhea, treatment was held until resolution of toxicities to grade <2. The dose of doxorubicin
was decreased by 20% for grade 4 mucositis. Dose
modifications for paclitaxel plus carboplatin were as
follows: if on the scheduled day of chemotherapy
administration the absolute neutrophil count was
<1000 cells/mm3 or the platelet count was <100,000
cells/mm3, paclitaxel plus carboplatin was delayed
for 1 week. If blood counts remained unsatisfactory
after 2 1-week delays the patient was removed from
the protocol. The dose of both carboplatin and paclitaxel was reduced by 20% in the setting of grade 3
mucositis, febrile neutropenia, or grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Patients who developed grade 3 neurotoxocity were removed from the protocol.

Response Assessments
Tumor response evaluations were performed after
completion of the doxorubicin plus gemcitabine
sequence and at the completion of paclitaxel plus
carboplatin. Complete response (CR) was defined as
the disappearance of all clinical evidence of tumor
by physical examination, radiographic studies, or
both for a minimum of 4 weeks. Partial response
(PR) was defined as 50% decrease in the summed
products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions for at least 4 weeks, without simultaneous increase in the size of any lesion, or the
appearance of any new lesion. Progression was
defined as >25% increase in tumor size or the
appearance of any new lesion. A reference radiologist
(S.M.) reviewed all major radiographic responses. For
patients with nonmeasurable primary unresectable
disease, PR was defined as downstaging of the primary tumor by 2 or more clinical stages.
Statistical Considerations
The primary objective of the study was to assess the
response rate of the 4-drug regimen. The study utilized a single-stage design, enrolling 25 patients,

allowing for a noncomparative estimation of efficacy
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 6 20%. Confidence intervals for response were calculated assuming binomial distribution. Survival time was calculated
as the difference between the last follow-up date or
date of death and the date at which chemotherapy
was initiated. Survival distribution was estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Twenty-five patients were enrolled on this single-institution trial. Patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The median creatinine clearance of this
cohort was 47 mL/min. All patients eligible based on
the presence of a solitary kidney also had a serum creatinine >1.5 or a creatinine clearance <60 mL/min.
For the majority of patients the urinary bladder was
the primary site of tumor. Notably, 7 of 25 (28%)
patients had primary unresectable disease 6 regional
lymph node metastases without distant metastases.
Drug Delivery
The majority of patients (15/25, 60%) completed all
17 cycles of chemotherapy and 21 of 25 (84%) completed 15 of the planned 17 cycles of chemotherapy. At least 1 dose delay was required in 14 of 25

dose delays/reductions are detailed in Table 2.

Toxicity
The grade 3–4 toxicities were predominantly hematologic (Table 3). Whereas 28% of patients experienced
grade 3–4 neutropenia, there were only 2 (8%) episodes of febrile neutropenia. There were no episodes
of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Frequent nonhematologic grade 1–2 toxicities included: fatigue (grade 1:
32%, grade 2: 48%), nausea (grade 1: 48%, grade 2:
8%), neuropathy (grade 1: 48%, grade 2: 4%), anorexia (grade 1: 36%, grade 2: 12%), and stomatitis
(grade 1: 16%, grade 2: 24%). Grade 3–4 nonhematologic toxicities were infrequent, with the exception of
grade 3–4 thrombotic episodes, which occurred in 4
patients. Notably, the 2 patients with grade 4 thrombotic episodes were diagnosed with asymptomatic
incidental pulmonary emboli on restaging CT scans.

Response and Survival
The response outcomes are detailed in Table 4. Of
the 25 patients enrolled, 2 patients had nonmeasurable unresectable disease of the bladder and were
only evaluable for response at the completion of
therapy, 1 patient discontinued treatment due to toxicity before completing the first restaging assessment,
and 1 patient with unresectable disease experienced
a marked improvement in symptoms after doxorubicin-gemcitabine and withdrew from the protocol
before completing restaging. Based on intent-to-treat,
at the completion of therapy there were 5 complete

responses (20%; 95% CI: 6%–41%) and 9 partial
responses (36%; 18%–58%) for an overall response rate
of 56% (95% CI: 35%–76%). Three patients improved
their response at the end of therapy compared with
their response post-doxorubicin plus gemcitabine.
Responses were achieved in 12 of 17 (71%) patients
with either a primary unresectable tumor or metastases limited to the lymph nodes and in 1 of 8 (13%)
patients with visceral metastases.
The median survival of the 25 patients was 15
months (95% CI: 11–30 months) with a 2-year survival of 32% and 3-year survival of 25% (Fig. 1).
Seven patients treated with chemotherapy 6 surgical
consolidation remain alive and disease-free at a median follow-up for survivors of 45 months (range, 14–
68 months): 3 of these patients had primary unresectable disease and underwent cystectomy after
downstaging with chemotherapy, 3 patients had
documented recurrent disease in the pelvic and/or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes after initial cystectomy
and achieved a complete response to chemotherapy
(without surgical consolidation), and 1 patient developed recurrent disease in the retroperitoneal lymph
nodes after an initial nephroureterectomy, achieved a
major response to chemotherapy, and underwent surgical consolidation with a retroperitoneal lymph node
dissection revealing microscopic residual disease.

DISCUSSION
This trial confirms the feasibility, tolerability, and activity of a dose-dense sequential chemotherapy program for patients with advanced UC and impaired
renal function. The overall and complete response
rates of 56% and 20% achieved with this regimen are

553

promising. Further, the 15-month median survival,
with 28% of patients achieving prolonged diseasefree survival, suggests that durable responses can be
achieved in this population treated with carboplatinbased therapy 6 surgical consolidation.
Our trial raises several important issues regarding the management of patients with metastatic UC
and impaired renal function: 1) Should these patients
be ‘‘lumped’’ in clinical trials with patients who are
ineligible for cisplatin for other reasons? 2) Are 3 or 4
drug regimens truly better than doublets in this
population? 3) Does dose-density matter?
Several previous trials have explored chemotherapeutic regimens, particularly the gemcitabine/carboplatin doublet, in cisplatin-ineligible patients with
metastatic UC.2–6 Notably, these trials employed heterogeneous eligibility criteria and most did not distinguish patients ineligible for cisplatin based on renal
function alone from patients ineligible for other reasons (eg, poor performance status). This distinction is
important, as the former group of patients may benefit
from more aggressive carboplatin-based regimens,
whereas the latter patients may not tolerate such treatment. Indeed, we have previously shown that performance status is 1 of the 2 major predictors of response
to chemotherapy and survival in patients with metastatic UC.15 The independent prognostic significance
of impaired renal function has not been defined.
The optimal number of agents to include in firstline treatment regimens for patients with metastatic UC
and renal impairment is unknown. A large Phase III
trial conducted by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) is currently
randomizing cisplatin-ineligible patients to treatment
with gemcitabine þ carboplatin versus methotrexate
þ carboplatin þ vinblastine. This trial will provide
some insight into the optimal number of drugs; however, this trial, too, includes patients with poor renal
function and/or poor performance status and these
results may not apply to the large proportion of
patients with renal impairment alone. Furthermore,
newer carboplatin-based multiagent regimens, particularly the triplet of gemcitabine, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, have shown very impressive activity in UC.16
When viewed in the context of contemporary trials
exploring the gemcitabine plus carboplatin doublet,
there is some suggestion of improved outcomes with
our 4-drug regimen or the gemcitabine, carboplatin,
and paclitaxel triplet (Table 5). However, this may be
the result of an imbalance in baseline prognostic factors and/or the small sample sizes involved and, ultimately, randomized trials are needed.
Whether dose-dense administration of chemotherapy improves outcomes in this patient popula-

tion can also not be determined by this single arm
trial. Dose-dense chemotherapy has been explored in
UC in the past. An EORTC trial randomized patients
to dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin,
and cisplatin (MVAC) versus standard MVAC and
demonstrated a significant difference in the complete
response rates and progression-free survival favoring
the dose-dense arm.17 Whereas there was no significant difference in survival with the dose-dense
regimen, the trial was powered to detect a 50% difference and a lesser benefit may have been missed.
Interestingly, in a further report of the study with
longer follow-up the dose-dense regimen was associated with a 5-year survival rate of 21.8% versus
13.5% with the standard regimen.18 These data suggest that dose-density may have a beneficial effect in
a subset of patients with potentially ‘curable’ disease
in contrast to the majority of patients who do not
benefit from such an approach.
To our knowledge, our study includes the longest
follow-up reported with carboplatin-based therapy in
UC, with prior trials generally limited to 1–2 years of
follow-up. In this regard, the prolonged disease-free
survival observed in a cohort of patients deserves
further mention: as previously reported with cisplatin-based therapy,15,19 a subset of patients with
primary unresectable disease or lymph node-only
metastases treated with this carboplatin-based regimen 6 surgical consolidation achieved durable disease control; 7 patients (28%) are alive and diseasefree at a median follow-up for survivors of 45
months. Similar to the experience with dose-dense
MVAC, dose-dense carboplatin-based therapy may be
particularly important in this subset of patients.
Dose-dense sequential chemotherapy consisting
of doxorubicin plus gemcitabine followed by paclitaxel plus carboplatin is tolerable and active in
patients with advanced UC and impaired renal function. Whereas randomized trials are ultimately
needed to determine the optimal number, combination, and schedule of cytotoxic agents to utilize in

this patient population, limited patient and financial
resources restrict the number hypotheses that will
ultimately be tested in the Phase III setting. When
viewed in the context of contemporary controls
(Table 5), the inclusion of additional active drugs to
the regimen (particularly paclitaxel) may be more
critical than dose-dense sequential delivery, at least
in the presence of distant metastases. Current efforts
should focus on defining the role of adding taxanes
to first-line therapy (as is being done by the EORTC
in cisplatin-eligible patients) and, more important,
integrating novel treatment strategies that may incrementally improve outcomes. Given the durable disease-free survival in a subset of patients and the
absence of randomized data, the current regimen
could be a considered a treatment option for medically fit cisplatin-ineligible patients with unresectable
primary tumors or lymph node-only metastases.
