PIPKIg Regulates b-Catenin Transcriptional Activity
Downstream of Growth Factor Receptor Signaling
Mark Schramp1, Narendra Thapa1, Jessica Heck2, and Richard Anderson1

Abstract
Increased b-catenin transcriptional activity downstream of the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway has been
observed in many human tumors, most notably colorectal carcinomas. However, b-catenin activation is also
observed in many human malignancies with no observable Wnt activity. Wnt-independent pathways that
activate b-catenin remain undefined, yet have the potential to play a significant role during tumorigenesis. Here,
we report that phosphotidylinositol phosphate kinase Ig (PIPKIg), an enzyme that generates phosphoinositide
messengers in vivo, directly associates with b-catenin and increases b-catenin activity downstream of growth
factor stimulation. PIPKIg expression and kinase activity enhance b-catenin phosphorylation on residues that
promote nuclear importation and transcriptional activity. Lastly, we show that b-catenin is required for PIPKIgdependent increased cell proliferation. These results reveal a novel mechanism in which PIPKIg expression and
catalytic activity enhance b-catenin nuclear translocation and expression of its target genes to promote
tumorigenic phenotypes. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1282–91. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
b-Catenin is a potent oncogene with dual functions in the
cell (reviewed in ref. 1). It was first identified as an essential
component in mediating E-cadherin–based cell–cell contacts.
Within the adherens junction, b-catenin links the cytoplasmic
domain of E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton via its interaction with a-catenin. In addition, b-catenin acts as a transcriptional activator in many signaling pathways, including
the Wnt/Wingless, epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
signaling pathways (2–5). In unstimulated cells, cytoplasmic
levels of b-catenin are kept in check by a degradation complex
consisting of axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b), and
the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC; ref. 1). b-Catenin phosphorylation by GSK-3b results in binding b-TRCP/
HOS and its ubiquitylation by SCFb-TRCP, leading to proteasomic degradation (6). Wnt stimulation prevents GSK-3b–
mediated phosphorylation and degradation and instead leads
to unique phosphorylation events on b-catenin, resulting in its
translocation to the nucleus where it interacts with different
transcription factors, most notably members of the TCF/LEF

family, to control the expression of its target genes, including c-Jun, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 (2, 3, 7).
The role of b-catenin in promoting tumorigenesis has been
well documented (8). Increased b-catenin activity can lead to
uncontrolled cell proliferation, altered cell migration, and
changes in cell polarity (8, 9). Activating mutations within the
Wnt signaling pathway occur in more than 90% of colorectal
cancers and have been observed in hepatocellular carcinomas
(1). In addition, roles for b-catenin in promoting breast and
prostate cancer are emerging (10, 11). However, activating
mutations within the Wnt signaling pathway, including CTNNB1
(which encodes b-catenin), is less frequent in many epithelialderived cancers, including breast cancer (6, 12), although
increased levels of nuclear b-catenin are still frequently observed
(13). This indicates that other signaling pathways can induce
b-catenin activation during tumorigenesis.
A hallmark of tumorigenesis is the acquisition of invasive
capabilities (14). Emerging evidence supports an epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) during tumor progression,
which results in the loss of E-cadherin–based contacts and
increased invasiveness (15, 16). Disruption of E-cadherin–
mediated adhesions correlates with increased b-catenin–
dependent transcription and poor prognosis in cancer patients
(17). Forced expression of E-cadherin is able to reduce the
tumorigenicity of epithelial-derived cancer cells (18), at least
in part, due to its ability to sequester b-catenin in the cytoplasm.
Stimulation of cells with growth factors, such as EGF or TGF-b,
can induce the disruption of E-cadherin–based contacts and
promote EMT (19, 20). Activation by these growth factors also
increases the activity of many kinases, including Src, protein
kinase B (PKB or AKT), and protein kinase A (PKA), all of which
can increase b-catenin nuclear localization and activity (21–24).
Phosphoinositides are a group of signaling molecules that
affect a vast array of cellular processes, including polarization,

directional migration, gene expression, and proliferation (25,
26). Phosphotidylinositol phosphate kinase Ig (PIPKIg) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to generate
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (herein referred to as
PIP2) in vivo (26). In addition to its use as a precursor to 3
separate and essential second messengers [inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), and PIP3], PIP2
directly binds many protein effectors, regulating their activity.
PIPKIg can alternatively splice to give rise to at least five
different protein isoforms, known as PIPKIgi1–5 (27). While
the localization of endogenous isoforms is distinct, overexpressed PIPKIgs lose their localization specificity and can be
found ubiquitously throughout the cell (27). However, understanding the effects of overexpression is of critical importance,
as recently it was shown that PIPKIg overexpression in breast
cancer patients correlated with decreased survival (28) and
increased PIPKI activity was observed in hepatocellular carcinomas (29).
PIPKIg expression correlates with poor survival in breast
cancer patients. In defining a cellular mechanism for this
clinical observation, we found that PIPKIs associate with
b-catenin and that increased PIPKIg-dependent cellular proliferation requires b-catenin. Phosphoinositide messengers
derived from PIPKIg expression hyperactivate the b-catenin
transcriptional machinery. In addition, PIPKIgi2-generated
phosphoinositide messengers result in the hyperphosphorylation and increased nuclear accumulation of b-catenin. Finally,
we show that PIPKIgi2 expression enhances the activation of
b-catenin downstream of growth factor stimulation.

Materials and Methods
Please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for the
following sections: "Reagents"; "Cell culture and transfection";
"Lysate preparation and immunoblotting"; "Immunofluorescence and microscopy"; and "GST affinity pull-down assays."
Luciferase reporter assays
All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS. HeLa Tet-Off cells stably
expressing PIPKIg constructs have been described elsewhere
(30). All other cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection and maintained in passage for less than 3
months. To examine the effects of PIPKIs on b-catenin
transcriptional activity, cells were transfected with Super8XTOPFLASH (Millipore), pRL-null Renilla (Promega), and
pCMV-HA alone or pCMV-HA containing WT or mutant
PIPKI constructs. Eighteen to 24 hours after transfection,
luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the Pharmingen Monolight 3010 Luminometer (BD Pharmingen). Reporter expression was normalized to cotransfected Renilla luciferase
activity. To determine whether E-cadherin could inhibit the
activation of b-catenin, pCMV-myc, or pCMV-myc E-cadherin
cytoplasmic domain was included at the time of transfection.
For growth factor receptor activation experiments, cells were
transfected as stated. Cells were serum starved in DMEM þ
0.5% FBS for 12 to 24 hours and stimulated with the appro-

priate growth factor. Twenty-four hours later, b-catenin activity was assayed as stated.
Cell growth assays
Oligonucleotide sequences used for generation of PIPKIg
short hairpin RNA were GCCACCTTCTTTCGAAGAA (PIPKIgshRNA) and GCCTTCTTCGCTAAACGAA (ConshRNA).
Generation of replication-defective infectious viral particles
and the transduction of the cells were carried out following the
protocol provided by Addgene, as described previously (31, 32).
In brief, synthesized oligonucleotides were annealed and
cloned into HpaI and XhoI sites of pLL3.7 vector (Addgene).
Stabl3 competent cells (Life Technologies) were used for
transformation and DNA purification. For generation of viral
particles, lentiviral vector with accessory plasmids (pCMVVSVG, pRSV-Rev, and pMD2.G) were cotransfected into HEK
293T cells, using calcium phosphate. Conditioned medium was
collected 48 hours posttransfection, filtered through a 0.45mmol filter, and viral particles were concentrated by centrifugation at 24,000 rpm in Beckman SW28 centrifuge (Beckman
Coulter) for 2 hours at 4 C. Subconfluent HeLa cells were
infected with viral supernatant in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL
polybrene (Sigma). Infected cells were sorted using a cell sorter
(GFP expression driven by CMV) or individual clones were
isolated. PIPKIg knockdown was examined by immunoblotting. To monitor proliferation, infected cells were seeded into
12-well culture plates at a density of 1,000 cells/well. Manual
cell counting was done every 24 hours for 8 days. Cell numbers
were counted from at least 3 wells for each cell type and
expressed as mean  SD from one representative experiment.
To monitor cell proliferation in HeLa Tet-Off cells in conjunction with b-catenin knockdown, HeLa Tet-Off cells
expressing empty vector (EV) or PIPKIgi2 were grown in
DMEM þ 10% FBS without doxycycline to induce PIPKIgi2
expression. An equal number of cells were transfected with
b-catenin–validated or control stealth siRNA oligos (Invitrogen), using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer's instructions, and proliferation was monitored
for 48 hours posttransfection. The extent of b-catenin knockdown was monitored at the 48-hour time point. Manual cell
countings from at least 3 wells for each cell type and time
point were expressed as mean  SD.

Results
PIPKIg associates with b-catenin independent of
E-cadherin
PIPKIg associates with a region on E-cadherin that lies
within the previously defined b-catenin–binding region (30).
Because of this, an interaction between PIPKIg and b-catenin
was investigated. b-Catenin coimmunoprecipitated with transiently transfected HA-tagged PIPKIa, PIPKIgi1, PIPKIgi2, and
PIPKIgi2KD from HeLa cells but not from cells transfected with
EV (Fig. 1A). Because both b-catenin and PIPKIg splice variants
associate with E-cadherin and E-cadherin is expressed at low
levels in these cells (data not shown), we determined whether
E-cadherin was required to generate an association between
b-catenin and PIPKIs. Endogenous PIPKIg and b-catenin

Figure 1. PIPKIg directly associates with b-catenin independent of E-cadherin. A, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with EV or the HA-PIPKI shown
and an interaction with b-catenin was assayed by immunoprecipitation (IP), using anti-HA antibody. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were probed with anti-HA,
anti-b-catenin, and anti-GAPDH to monitor transfection and protein levels. B, endogenous b-catenin and PIPKIgi1 were coimmunoprecipitated from

coimmunoprecipitated from A431D and CHO-K1 cells, which
lack classical cadherins (33, 34), indicating that this interaction
is independent of cadherins in vivo (Fig. 1B; data not shown).
Finally, to test whether or not b-catenin and PIPKIg were able
to directly associate, GST pull-down assays using recombinant
proteins were used, which showed that b-catenin and PIPKIgi1
are able to directly interact (Fig. 1C). The PIPKIgi1 protein does
not contain a C-terminal extension and its sequence is conserved in all PIPKIg splice variants (27). The combined data
show that PIPKIg interacts directly and separately with both
b-catenin and E-cadherin and that the b-catenin–interacting
region on PIPKIg lies within the conserved region. As PIP
kinases often regulate the proteins they associate with, the
impact of PIPKIs on b-catenin activity was investigated.
PIPKIg stimulates b-catenin transcriptional activity
To examine the effect of PIPKIg on the transcriptional
activity of b-catenin, TOPflash luciferase reporter constructs
(35) were transfected into HeLa cells expressing PIPKIs, and
transcriptional activity was quantified (22). When grown in the
presence of serum, PIPKIa and each PIPKIg isoform
(PIPKIgi1–5) stimulated b-catenin transcriptional activity in
HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, this increased activity
required the generation of phosphoinositides, as kinase-inactive ("kinase-dead," KD) mutants of PIPKIs, PIPKIaKD, PIPKIgi2KD, or PIPKIgi4KD failed to stimulate b-catenin
transcriptional activity. Furthermore, PIPKIg KD isoforms
diminished b-catenin activity, indicating that they act in a
dominant-negative fashion (Fig. 2A). Expression of PIPKIg
isoforms with tetracycline-inducible cell lines (HeLa Tet-Off)
showed that PIPKIg stimulated b-catenin activity to the same
or greater extent as transient transfection experiments and

1284

Cancer Res; 71(4) February 15, 2011

PIPKIg KD mutants diminished b-catenin activity to that in
uninduced cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Transient transfection of PIPKIs in HEK293T cells also stimulated b-catenin
transcriptional activity, indicating that this signaling event
was not exclusive to HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
PIPKIg can modulate the adherens junction and E-cadherin
trafficking in epithelial cells (30). In addition, E-cadherin
expression can inhibit b-catenin activity in mesenchymal-like
cells (16). We determined whether PIPKI expression could
stimulate b-catenin transcriptional activity in polarized
epithelial cells. Surprisingly, expression of PIPKIa or PIPKIg
isoforms in MDCK cells (Madin Darby canine kidney cells) did
not significantly increase b-catenin transcriptional activity
(Fig. 2B). We then tested whether reexpression of E-cadherin
could block b-catenin activity in HeLa cells grown in the
presence of serum. The E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail domain
(ECD-CT; ref. 30) was expressed because full-length E-cadherin protein is quickly internalized and degraded in HeLa
cells (data not shown), thus eliminating the necessity for
oligomer homophilic interactions between adjacent cells for
E-cadherin complex assembly. ECD-CT expression in HeLa
cells blocked PIPKI activation of b-catenin (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, ECD-CT expression in cells overexpressing PIPKIgi2
significantly reduced the association between PIPKIgi2 and
b-catenin (Fig. 2D).
PIPKIg expression and catalytic activity enhance
b-catenin nuclear accumulation
Wnt or growth factor stimulation can lead to the accumulation of b-catenin in the nucleus, where it regulates gene
expression (2, 3, 9). b-Catenin localization changes were observed upon expression of PIPKIg. The activation of b-catenin

by PIPKIgi1 and PIPKIgi2 was the focus, but we do not
discount the possibility that PIPKIa, PIPKIgi4, or PIPKIgi5
can also result in similar cellular phenotypes. Wild-type or
PIPKIg mutants were expressed in HeLa cells, and immunofluorescence was used to visualize changes in the localization
of endogenous levels of b-catenin. Transient expression of
PIPKIgi2 increased nuclear accumulation of b-catenin more
than 4-fold when compared with cells transfected with EV
(Fig. 3A–C). This accumulation required catalytic activity as
expression of PIPKIgi2KD failed to increase nuclear b-catenin
levels (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed in HeLa Tet-Off
cells stably expressing PIPKIgi2 or PIPKIgi2KD (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). In addition, both transient and stable
expression of PIPKIgi1 or PIPKIgi1KD in HeLa cells revealed a
similar phenotype (data not shown), indicating that PIPKIg
overexpression stimulated the nuclear accumulation of
b-catenin in cells grown in the presence of serum.

enhanced by phosphorylation (21). Using HeLa Tet-Off cells,
we found that PIPKIgi2 expression increased b-catenin phosphorylation on Ser552 and Ser675 (Fig. 4). Furthermore,
phosphorylation levels at these sites decreased upon expression of PIPKIgi2KD (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, neither PIPKIgi2 nor
PIPKIgi2KD expression significantly altered b-catenin protein
levels, nor did their expression alter b-catenin phosphorylation on Ser33, Ser37, and Ser45, sites known to be involved in
the b-catenin proteasomal degradation pathway (ref. 36;
Fig. 4). b-Catenin activation results in transcriptional changes
in target genes. Consistent with this, upon expression of
PIPKIgi2, an increase in the protein levels of c-jun, fra-1,
TCF-1/LEF1, and cyclin D1, known targets of b-catenin transcriptional activity, was observed (refs. 7, 37, 38; Fig. 4).
However, PIPKIgi2 expression in HeLa cells did not result
in increased levels of Oct-4 or vimentin (data not shown).

Overexpression of PIPKIg correlates with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, and this
correlated with the expression of the EGF receptor HER1 and
HER2 (28). In addition, many growth factors, such as EGF and

TGF-b, stimulate b-catenin transcriptional activity (39, 40).
We set out to determine whether PIPKIg played a role in the
activation of b-catenin downstream of growth factor receptor
activation. For this, b-catenin transcriptional activity was
quantified in HeLa cells transiently expressing wild-type or
kinase inactive mutants of PIPKIa or PIPKIgi2. After transfection of the PIPKI, TOPflash, and Renilla reporter constructs,
cells were serum starved and then stimulated with EGF, HGF,
or TGF-b1/2. Increased PIPKIgi2 expression greatly enhanced
b-catenin–dependent transcriptional activity following treatment with growth factors (Fig. 5A). This increase in b-catenin
activity was dependent on its catalytic activity, as PIPKIgi2KD
failed to stimulate b-catenin (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, the activation of b-catenin following stimulation with EGF, HGF, or
TGF-b was PIPKIg specific, as PIPKIa expression did not
enhance b-catenin activity (Fig. 5A). EGF-mediated activation
of b-catenin was also enhanced in HeLa Tet-Off cells stably
expressing PIPKIgi2 and severely diminished in cells expressing PIPKIgi2KD (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Stimulation of
HeLa cells with EGF, HGF, or TGF-b resulted in expected
activation of signaling molecules within these pathways, as
evidenced by Western blotting using activation-specific anti-

1286

bodies (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results indicate that
PIPKIg enhances b-catenin transcriptional activation downstream of growth factor receptor stimulation.
The classical Wnt pathway leads to the activation of
b-catenin. Increased expression of PIPKIgi2 or PIPKIgi2KD
did not significantly affect b-catenin activity following Wnt
stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S3A). However, Wnt-dependent activation of b-catenin was moderately but consistently
enhanced upon PIPKIa expression and decreased upon PIPKIaKD expression, though the regulation was not statistically
significant (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Recently, PI4KIIa and
PIP5KIb were shown to be required for LRP6 phosphorylation
downstream of Wnt stimulation (41). PIPKIa expression
enhanced b-catenin activity when cells were grown in sera
(Fig. 2A). This suggests that the PIPKIa modulates b-catenin
within some agonist-, but not growth factor-, stimulated
pathways.
Next, we determined whether growth factor stimulation
induced b-catenin phosphorylation patterns similar to
PIPKIgi2 expression. EGF stimulation increased EGFR phosphorylation on Tyr1173 and Tyr1086 (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S3B). In addition, EGF stimulation increased

PIPKIg Regulates b-Catenin Transcriptional Activity

To further explore this possibility, the growth rate of cells
expressing PIPKIg was monitored. Knockdown of PIPKIg
using siRNA in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells results in
a significant decrease in proliferation (28). Furthermore,
PIPKIg expression in these cells enhanced b-catenin activity,
a result dependent on its catalytic activity (Fig. 6A). In addition, lentiviral-mediated knockdown of PIPKIg in HeLa cells
also decreased proliferation (Fig. 6B). siRNA was used to
knock down b-catenin in HeLa Tet-Off cells expressing EV
or PIPKIgi2. When grown in the presence of serum, PIPKIgi2
expression significantly increased cell proliferation (Fig. 6C,
Igi2 control vs. EV control). This increase diminished upon
treatment with b-catenin–specific siRNA (Fig. 6C). Surprisingly, knockdown of b-catenin in HeLa Tet-Off cells expressing
EV had little effect on the growth rate when grown in the
presence of serum (Fig. 6C). This shows that PIPKIg expression enhances cell proliferation in epithelial-derived tumorigenic cells through its ability to activate b-catenin.

b-catenin phosphorylation on Ser552 and Ser675 (Fig. 5B).
Surprisingly, the stimulation of HeLa cells with EGF resulted
in a decreased association between endogenous PIPKIg and
b-catenin, as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using pan-PIPKIg antibodies (Fig. 5C). In cells overexpressing PIPKIgi2, EGF treatment enhanced EGFR
phosphorylation and b-catenin phosphorylation on Ser552
and Ser675 (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, EGF treatment increased
the association between overexpressed PIPKIgi2 and b-catenin (Fig. 5E).
b-Catenin is required for tumorigenic phenotypes
associated with PIPKIg expression
Previously, PIPKIg expression in breast cancers was shown
to inversely correlate with patient survival (28). The cellular
mechanisms by which PIPKIg activates b-catenin suggest that
these molecules could cooperate to promote tumorigenesis.

The findings reported here represent a previously unrecognized role for PIPKIg in regulating b-catenin transcriptional
activity, providing a potential mechanism for understanding
how PIPKIg promotes tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence is
defining significant roles for signaling pathways that activate
b-catenin independent of Wnt and GSK-3b. Understanding
how these pathways modulate b-catenin transcriptional activity is extremely important, as b-catenin can influence multiple
aspects of tumorigenesis, including proliferation, migration,
loss of cell polarity, and the establishment of a less differentiated state. Our findings mimic those of other groups in
that the increased trascriptional activity of b-catenin is not
accompanied by significant changes to its overall protein
levels (3, 5, 22, 40, 42). b-Catenin activation via unique
signaling pathways provides novel therapeutic targets for
the treatment of malignancies.
Previously, PIPKIg splice variants have been shown to
interact directly with E-cadherin, modulating its trafficking
to and from the plasma membrane (30). In normal epithelial
cells, b-catenin is incorporated into cell–cell adhesions, where
it provides a physical link between the cytoplasmic domain of
E-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, b-catenin is
required for the establishment of cell polarity in normal
epithelia (43). Upon depletion of Ca2þ or stimulation with
growth factors, such as EGF, HGF, or TGF-b, E-cadherin is
rapidly internalized, increasing cytoplasmic levels of b-catenin
(21, 44). PIPKIg could activate b-catenin by enhancing the
endocytosis and degradation of E-cadherin, thereby preventing E-cadherin from sequestering b-catenin at the cell membrane. We observe that HeLa cells express low levels of Ecadherin that localizes to the plasma membrane at sites of
cell–cell contact when cells are confluent. Expression of
PIPKIg in these cells could lead to higher levels of cytoplasmic
b-catenin, thus allowing for a greater activation. Consistent
with this model, overexpression of the E-cadherin C-terminal
domain blocked PIPKIg-mediated increase in b-catenin transcriptional activity. However, expression of PIPKIg in normal

epithelial cells, such as MDCKs, does not prevent E-cadherin
translocation to the membrane or the formation of cell–cell
contacts (30), nor does it significantly increase b-catenin
activity, suggesting that other mechanisms are required to
initiate E-cadherin endocytosis and/or b-catenin activation. In
support of this, E-cadherin endocytosis is not sufficient to
activate b-catenin when the b-catenin degradation complex is
present (45).
Activation of some growth factor–stimulated signaling
pathways has been shown to inhibit b-catenin degradation
and/or enhance b-catenin stabilization and nuclear translocation (21). Because these pathways are often hyperactivated

in cancers, this could explain why we see increased b-catenin
activity upon PIPKIg expression only in transformed cells.
Therefore, under circumstances such as increased growth
factor signaling or exposure to different extracellular stimuli,
higher levels of the PIPKIg protein results in a more enhanced
activation of b-catenin. A recent report showed that b-catenin
nuclear translocation occurs primarily in the peripheral cells
of a tumor mass and correlates with an increased propensity
for migration (46). b-Catenin transcriptional activity can
enhance EMT, a process resulting in increased cellular migration and invasion associated with metastatic formation (47).
We observe an enhanced activation of b-catenin in cells

PIPKIg Regulates b-Catenin Transcriptional Activity

Figure 6. b-Catenin is required for tumorigenic phenotypes associated with PIPKIg expression. A, b-catenin transcriptional activity was measured in MDA-MB231 cells transiently transfected with TOPflash, pRL-null Renilla, and EV or the HA-PIPKI shown. Cells were grown for 24 hours in the presence of serum prior to
lysis and quantification of luciferase activity. *, P  0.01; n  3; error bars, SD. B, HeLa cells were infected with lentivirus containing scrambled or PIPKIgspecific shRNA and cell proliferation monitored for 6 days postinfection. Western blot analysis revealed the efficiency of PIPKIg knockdown 72 hours
postinfection. *, P  0.05; n  3; error bars, SD. C, HeLa Tet-Off parental and PIPKIgi2-expressing cells were treated with control or b-catenin–specific siRNA

overexpressing PIPKIg upon treatment with TGF-b, a known
inducer of EMT (20); however, we did not observe changes in
the protein levels of EMT-associated genes vimentin and Oct-4
in HeLa cells. A more thorough investigation of the global gene
expression profiles of PIPKIg-overexpressing cells will be
required, although cell type–specific profiles will probably
be found. It is likely that PIPKIg can increase the activation
of b-catenin on more than one level, as it could lead to its
disassociation from E-cadherin and act within signaling pathways to increase its nuclear localization and transcriptional
activity.
PIPKIg catalytic activity is required to enhance b-catenin
activation. Although it remains to be shown, this is presumably through its ability to generate phosphoinositide messengers, likely PI4,5P2, as the other messenger known to be
generated by PIPKIs in vivo, PI3,4,5P3, utilizes a substrate that
is present at miniscule cellular concentrations (26, 48). A
spatial and temporal increase in PI4,5P2 could enhance signaling pathways which utilize this messenger and also activate
b-catenin. For example, PI3K could utilize pools of PIP2 to
generate higher amounts of PIP3, thereby increasing or

www.aacrjournals.org

prolonging the activation of this signal. We observe an
increase in the phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser552 and
Ser675 upon PIPKIg expression. Ser552 can be phosphorylated
by AKT (22), resulting in b-catenin accumulation in the
nucleus and increased transcriptional activity. In addition,
AKT is activated downstream of PIP3 generation by PI3K,
whose activation within cells following stimulation by growth
factors, such as EGF, HGF, and TGF-b, has been well documented (49).
Phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser552 and Ser675 is also
mediated by cyclic AMP–dependent PKA, enhancing b-catenin activity (50), and Ser675 has been shown to be phosphorylated downstream of p21-activated protein kinase-1
(PAK-1; ref. 42). Hydrolysis of PIP2 generated by PIPKIg can
induce many physiologic responses depending on the cell
type, most notably increasing cellular Ca2þ levels (26). As
PKA and Ca2þ synergize to induce cellular responses, this
may explain how PIPKIg enhances b-catenin activity. In the
future, it will be important to further define the kinase(s)
responsible for b-catenin phosphorylation downstream of
PIPKIg activity. In addition to playing a potential role in the

activation of kinases that activate b-catenin, PIP2 generation
might regulate the trafficking of endocytosed vesicles to the
lysosome. A dominant-negative PIPKIg could block E-cadherin degradation, leading to its recycling back to the
membrane where it could associate with b-catenin, decreasing its nuclear activity.
The activation of b-catenin by PIPKIg is almost assuredly
through an indirect mechanism. It has yet to be determined
whether PIPKIg activation of b-catenin requires their physical
association. Surprisingly, the association between endogenous
PIPKIg and b-catenin decreased upon stimulation of HeLa
cells with EGF. This suggests that b-catenin activation by
PIPKIg splice variants was primarily an indirect effect. As
endogenous levels of PIPKIg splice variants localize to different cellular sites, it will be important to further define this
interaction to gain insight into its functional role. In addition,
further studies are needed to characterize the expression of
PIPKIg splice variants during tumorigenesis. In cells overexpressing PIPKIg, treatment with EGF enhanced the association between the two proteins. It is plausible that PIPKIg could
localize b-catenin within signaling complexes containing PIP2
effectors that lead to its activation.

In summary, we have uncovered a novel component within
signaling pathways that can be used to activate b-catenin.
PIPKIg expression and activity lead to b-catenin nuclear
accumulation, thereby increasing its ability to induce transcriptional changes. Furthermore, we have shown that in
response to growth factor stimulation, PIPKIg expression
markedly increases b-catenin activity and that the increase
in cell proliferation observed in mesenchymal-like cells overexpressing PIPKIg requires b-catenin, suggesting a role for this
pathway in tumor progression.
