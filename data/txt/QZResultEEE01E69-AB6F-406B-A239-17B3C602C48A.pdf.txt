Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) has been shown to induce mitochondrial apoptotic
signaling that can be negatively regulated by prosurvival Bcl-2
proteins. ABT-737 is a small-molecule BH3 mimetic that binds
to and antagonizes Bcl-2/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1. We show that
ABT-737 can synergistically enhance TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. ABT-737 was
shown to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis as shown by DNA
fragmentation, activation of caspase-8 and Bid, and cleavage
of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. A Bax conformational change induced by TRAIL was enhanced by ABT-737.
ABT-737 disrupted the interaction of Bak with Bcl-xL in both
cell lines. Furthermore, ABT-737 untethered the proapoptotic
BH3-only protein Bim from its sequestration by Bcl-xL or
Bcl-2. Bim small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was shown to attenuate
caspase-3 cleavage and to reduce the cytotoxic effects of
TRAIL plus ABT-737 compared with shRNA control cells.
Finally, Mcl-1 shRNA potentiated caspase-3 cleavage by
ABT-737 and enhanced its cytotoxic effects. Taken together,
ABT-737 augments TRAIL-induced cell killing by unsequestering Bim and Bak and enhancing a Bax conformational
change induced by TRAIL. These findings suggest a novel
strategy to enhance cross-talk between the extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathways to improve therapeutic efficacy
against pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2944–51]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancers are intrinsically resistant tumors that
respond poorly to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Accordingly,
novel therapeutic strategies and combinatorial regimens are
seriously needed to enhance treatment efficacy. The death receptor
ligand tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF family, is a promising
anticancer agent due to its ability to induce apoptosis in a variety
of tumor cell types while having only negligible effects on normal
cells (1). TRAIL engages the extrinsic apoptotic pathway that
involves caspase-8 cleavage, death receptor binding, deathinducing signaling complex formation, and subsequent activation
of effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 (2). Most
human cancer cells are referred to as type II in that they require a
mitochondrial amplification step (intrinsic pathway) after a death

receptor stimulus to induce apoptosis (2, 3). Cross-talk between
these apoptotic pathways is mediated by caspase-8–induced Bid
cleavage (4–6). Truncated Bid is a proapoptotic BH3-only protein
that translocates to mitochondria, activates Bax, and stimulates
release of apoptogenic proteins (i.e., cytochrome c, Smac, and
HtrA2; refs. 7, 8). Given this scenario, strategies to enhance tumor
cell kill may require selective targeting of both the extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been shown
to confer resistance to TRAIL in human cancer cells (9–12).
Therefore, disabling antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may greatly
enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In this regard, the BH3
mimetic and small-molecule Bcl-2 antagonist ABT-737 binds
with high affinity to a hydrophobic groove on Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Bcl-w and prevents their binding with Bax, thereby shifting
the balance in favor of proapoptotic molecules (13). ABT-737
has been shown to lower the apoptotic threshold for certain
chemotherapeutic agents and has shown impressive preclinical
activity against lymphoma in a murine model (13). However,
ABT-737 binds to Mcl-1 with low affinity, and cells with Mcl-1
knockdown show enhanced ABT-737–induced cell death (14). To
date, the ability of ABT-737 to enhance TRAIL-mediated cell
death has not been reported.
Until recently, Bid was the only known link between the extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. However, recent data suggest
that TRAIL can induce Mcl-1 degradation with disruption of the
Mcl-1:Bim complex (15). In this study, we determined the ability of
ABT-737 to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells. We found that ABT-737 can markedly increase
TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic signaling by releasing
Bim from its sequestration by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL and by untethering
Bak from Bcl-xL. Additionally, ABT-737 potentiates a TRAILmediated Bax conformational change. These findings underscore
the importance of Bim and Bak in the cell death response to TRAIL
and demonstrate that targeting both the extrinsic and intrinsic
apoptotic pathways can increase therapeutic efficacy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, drugs, and reagents. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines
BxPC-3 and PANC-1 and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T
were used in this study. BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 1% sodium pyruvate.
293T cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Sigma) plus 10% FBS.
For lentivirus production, 293T cells were cultured in high-glucose
DMEM containing 2% FBS (System Biosciences). Recombinant human
TRAIL (Val114-Gly281) was obtained from R&D Systems and used fresh or
aliquoted and stored for less than a month at 80jC. ABT-737 was
obtained from Abbott Pharmaceuticals and was dissolved in DMSO to
produce a 20 mmol/L stock solution that was aliquoted and stored at
20jC.

Cell viability assay. Cell viability was determined in the presence or
absence of drug treatment using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) reduction
assay per manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). Briefly, 8,000 cells placed in
50-AL medium were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37jC
overnight. The next day, the study drugs were mixed in 50 AL of medium
and added to each well. The plate was incubated for a predetermined time
period and 20 AL of MTS/phenazine methosulfate solution were then added
into each well. The plate was then incubated at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 1 to 4 h. Absorbance at 492 nm was
measured and recorded using a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular
Devices). This assay was done in triplicate for each condition and the SD
was calculated.
DNA fragmentation assay. Approximately 104 cells were seeded into
24-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with
drug for the indicated time and centrifuged at 500  g for 4 min. DNA
fragmentation was then analyzed with a Cell Death Detection ELISA plus kit
(Roche Applied Science) per manufacturer’s manual. Absorbance was
measured at 405 nm (reference wavelength of 490 nm). Samples were run in
duplicate and the average value is shown.
Immunoprecipitation. Mock-treated cells or those treated with drugs
were harvested by scraping and then washed in cold PBS. After
centrifugation, the cell pellet was lysed by sonication in a cell lysis buffer
[10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L molybdic acid, 150 mmol/L KCl,
0.1% NP40, 5 mmol/L MgCl2] with protease inhibitors. Alternatively, the
cell pellet was lysed by incubating in CHAPS buffer [5 mmol/L MgCl2,
137 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% CHAPS, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, pH 7.5] for 30 min in ice. The cell lysate was again subjected to
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The protein concentration of the
supernatant was measured by detergent-compatible (DC) protein assay
(Bio-Rad) and the protein concentration was normalized to 5 mg/mL. The
lysate was precleaned by binding with protein A-Sepharose or protein
G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and then incubated with an antibody-protein
A or antibody-protein G complex, made by incubating antibody with
protein A or protein G beads in 0.5-mL PBS at room temperature for 2 h at
4jC overnight. Unbound proteins were washed thrice with 1 mL of original

lysis buffer or CHAPS buffer without protease inhibitors. Bound proteins
on the beads were eluted by boiling the sample in 70 AL of LDS sample
buffer (Invitrogen). Then, 30 AL of the eluted protein were used for one
Western blot.
Western blotting. Protein samples were prepared in a lysis buffer per
the procedure outlined above, normalized using DC protein assay reagents
(Bio-Rad), boiled in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and loaded onto 10%
SDS-PAGE gel for separation of protein with electrophoretic transfer onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was
blocked with 0.2% I-Block (Applied Biosystems) in PBS containing 0.1%
Tween 20 and incubated with the primary antibody in PBS containing 0.2%
I-Block and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4jC. The membrane was then
incubated with a secondary antibody in PBS containing 0.2% I-Block and
0.1% Tween 20 conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and then developed
with CDP-Star substrate (Applied Biosystems).
Bax conformational change. After treatment, PANC-1 cells were lysed
by incubating in CHAPS buffer [5 mmol/L MgCl2, 137 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% CHAPS, 10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.5] in the
presence of protease inhibitors for 30 min in ice. The cell lysates were then
incubated with protein G beads bound to Bax antibody 6A7 (Sigma)
overnight, as previously described (16). Protein G beads were washed thrice
with lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted with LDS sample buffer
(Invitrogen) containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Western blotting was then done
with a rabbit anti-Bax antibody (Cell Signaling).
Knockdown of Bim and Mcl-1 using lentiviral small hairpin RNA.
Target sequences for Bim and Mcl-1 were selected and synthesized by
the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core Facility. The targeting sequence
for Mcl-1 was GATTGTGACTCTCATTTCT (17). The targeting sequence
for Bim was GACCGAGAAGGTAGACAATTGC (18). After annealing, the
template forms a double-stranded DNA flanked by EcoRI and BamHI
sites, which was ligated into the Lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA)
cloning and expression vector pSIH-H1 (System Biosciences) and cut with
EcoRI and BamHI. Insertion at the intended site was confirmed by DNA
sequencing. For pseudovirus production, 2 Ag of endotoxin-free lentivector
expression construct were mixed with lentivector packaging plasmid
mix (System Biosciences) and diluted in serum OPTI-MEM medium

Calculation of combination index. The effect of combination between
ABT-737 and TRAIL was analyzed using Calcusyn software (Biosoft) as
previously reported (19).
Statistical analysis. The values shown represent the mean F SD for
triplicate experiments. The statistical significance of the differences
between experimental variables was determined with the Student t test.

Results
ABT-737 augments TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins have been shown to confer resistance to TRAILinduced apoptosis (3, 9, 11, 12). We determined whether the smallmolecule BH3 mimetic ABT-737, which targets Bcl-2/Bcl-xL but not
Mcl-1, could sensitize PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic carcinoma
cells to TRAIL. With cell viability and DNA fragmentation assays,
PANC-1 cells were found to be relatively resistant to TRAIL (0, 5, 10,
and 15 ng/mL) compared with BxPC-3 cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A
and B). Analysis of expression of Bcl-2 family members revealed
that PANC-1 cells have lower levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL expression
and undetectable Bcl-2 compared with BxPC-3 cells (Fig. 1C).
ABT-737 monotherapy reduced cell viability in both cell lines (Fig.
2A and D) and caused a minor induction of apoptosis shown by
DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B and D). Coadministration of ABT-737
and TRAIL was found to significantly reduce cell viability and to a
greater extent than did either drug alone in both cell lines (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2A and D). Furthermore, the combination of ABT-737 and
TRAIL significantly augmented apoptosis in both cell lines
(P < 0.05; Fig. 2B and D). Specifically, we treated PANC-1 cells
with a range of concentrations of ABT-737 that enhanced TRAILmediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). To
determine whether the cytotoxic effect of the drug combination
was synergistic or additive, we performed an analysis using the
median effect method. Different concentrations of ABT-737 and
TRAIL were analyzed at a fixed ratio for cell viability by MTS assay,
and the combination index values were calculated per the method
of Chou and Talalay (20). As shown in an isobologram, the
combination index values were <1, indicating a synergistic
interaction (Fig. 2C).
ABT-737 enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and Bax
conformational change. Exposure of PANC-1 cells to the
combination of ABT-737 plus TRAIL markedly enhanced the
activation of caspase-8, Bid, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase compared with either drug alone (Fig. 3A). Increased
activation of caspase-8 and Bid by ABT-737 plus TRAIL compared
with TRAIL alone is consistent with a feedback amplification
loop mediated by caspase-3 (21). These findings indicate that
ABT-737 can enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptotic signaling. We
observed an increase in Mcl-1 expression in TRAIL-treated PANC-1
cells, which has been shown to occur through activation of
nuclear factor nB (22). ABT-737 also increased Mcl-1 expression
(Fig. 3A). TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity and caspase activation
were observed at relatively low doses of TRAIL (0-20 ng/ml), and
similar effects have been reported in the PANC-1 cell line using
the same TRAIL preparation (23, 24). We then studied the effect
of ABT-737, TRAIL, and their combination on Bax conformational
change. Following a death stimulus, Bax undergoes a conformational change and translocates to the mitochondrial outer
membranes to regulate permeabilization, a critical determinant
of cell death (25). Activation of Bax (or Bak) is associated with
a conformational change that can be detected by antibodies
recognizing only the active protein conformers (16). We found
that ABT-737 can enhance a Bax conformational change induced

www.aacrjournals.org

by TRAIL in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 3B). TRAIL alone induced a
modest Bax conformational change whereas ABT-737 monotherapy
did not.
ABT-737 displaces Bim from its complex with Bcl-xL/Bcl-2.
We studied the mechanism by which ABT-737 can potentiate
TRAIL-induced cell death. Bim is a BH3-only protein that has been
shown to bind to all antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and is therefore a
potent proapoptotic molecule (26). To determine the effect of
ABT-737 treatment on the interaction between Bim and Bcl-xL,
we immunoprecipitated Bcl-xL and then probed for Bim. Bim was
uncoupled from Bcl-xL in ABT-737–treated PANC-1 cells compared
with control cells (Fig. 4A). In BxPC-3 cells, ABT-737 displaced Bim
from its complex with Bcl-2 but failed to disrupt its association
with Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 (Fig. 4B). Our immunoprecipitation data are
consistent with the observation that the majority of Bim is coupled
with Mcl-1 (Fig. 4B; ref. 27). To further show the importance of Bim

treated with the indicated drugs for 48 h and immunoblot analysis was done
with whole-cell lysates. h-Tubulin was used as a control for protein loading.
B, PANC-1 cells were treated with ABT-737 (20 Amol/L), TRAIL (10 ng/mL), or

in the potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by ABT-737, we
generated Bim-knockdown PANC-1 cells using lentiviral-delivered
shRNA. Knockdown of Bim was found to significantly attenuate the
reduction in cell viability induced by TRAIL and its combination
with ABT-737 (P < 0.05; Fig. 4C). Furthermore, Bim knockdown
attenuated the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3
induced by ABT-737 plus TRAIL treatment (Fig. 4D). Together, our
data show that ABT-737 unsequesters Bim from Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 and
suggest that ABT-737 enables free Bim to activate Bax to exert its
proapoptotic effect. Release of Bim seems to be independent of
Mcl-1 in our cells, indicating that its release from Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 is
indeed sufficient to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
ABT-737 can disrupt the interaction of Bak and Bcl-xL.
Recent studies have shown the importance of untethering Bak from
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL in determining the lethality of ABT-737 (14). Therefore,
we determined the effect of ABT-737 on the interaction between
Bak and Bcl-xL. By immunoprecipitation of Bak and probing Bak
and Bcl-xL in PANC-1 (Fig. 5A) and BxPC-3 (Fig. 5B) cells, we found
that ABT-737 can disrupt the binding of Bak to Bcl-xL in both cell
lines. The untethering of Bak, which resides in the outer
mitochondrial membrane, can then permeabilize the mitochondria, resulting in apoptosis.

Mcl-1 knockdown sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to
ABT-737. ABT-737 has a low affinity for Mcl-1 and may produce
only modest cytotoxic effects in cells that overexpress Mcl-1 (14).
Given that BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cell lines show endogenous Mcl-1
expression (Fig. 1C), we determined whether Mcl-1 knockdown
could sensitize PANC-1 cells to ABT-737–induced caspase-3
activation and cytotoxicity. Mcl-1 knockdown in PANC-1 cells
was achieved with lentiviral shRNA. Treatment with ABT-737
(20 Amol/L) was shown to markedly increase caspase-3 cleavage
in cells with Mcl-1 knockdown compared with nontargeted
shRNA–transduced PANC-1 cells (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the
reduction in cell viability induced by ABT-737 was enhanced by
Mcl-1 shRNA compared with nontransduced cells (Fig. 6B). These
data confirm the important role of Mcl-1 in conferring resistance to
cell death induced by ABT-737 and its relevance in our pancreatic
cancer cell lines.
ABT-737 augments gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity. We
determined whether ABT-737 can enhance the cytotoxic effects of
the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine. Gemcitabine is a conventional cytotoxic agent used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer
in humans. ABT-737 was shown to significantly augment the
reduction in cell viability induced by gemcitabine in both PANC-1

synergistic. The mechanistic basis for this effect includes the
ability of ABT-737 to unsequester Bim from its interaction with
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL molecules, to untether Bak from Bcl-xL, and to
activate Bax. Bim was freed from Bcl-xL in PANC-1 cells and from
Bcl-2 in BxPC-3 cells based on the relative abundance of these
proteins in each cell line. Bak was released from its complex with
Bcl-xL in both cell lines. Bim is a potent inducer of apoptosis
because Bim, Puma, and truncated Bid can neutralize all
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, whereas only selective interactions are
seen for Noxa and Bad (26). The functional significance of Bim was
shown in Bim-knockdown PANC-1 cells where caspase-8, caspase-9,
and caspase-3 cleavages were attenuated, and the cytotoxic effect of
ABT-737 plus TRAIL was significantly inhibited. Therefore, sequestration of Bim by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL seems to play a major role in TRAIL
resistance. ABT-737 did not disrupt Bim sequestration by Mcl-1 in
either cell line, indicating that uncoupling of Bim from Bcl-2 or
Bcl-xL proteins was sufficient to sensitize cells to TRAIL despite the
finding that the majority of Bim is bound by Mcl-1 (27).

and BxPC-3 cell lines (P < 0.05; see Supplementary figures). This
effect was observed at the same dosages of ABT-737 used in
combination with TRAIL.

Discussion
TRAIL has been shown to trigger cross-talk with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in many tumor cell types (2, 28).
Studies using Bax-deficient tumor cells have confirmed the
importance of a mitochondrial amplification step induced by
TRAIL (28, 29). We (9) and others (10–12) have previously shown
that forced Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL expression can inhibit TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. Therefore, disabling antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
may increase the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL. To evaluate
this strategy, we evaluated the small-molecule BH3 mimetic
ABT-737, which binds with high affinity to regulatory sites on
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, to induce a Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis (13, 14).
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and BxPC-3 with
differences in relative sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
were used. We report for the first time that ABT-737 produces a
marked sensitization to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, as shown by a
DNA fragmentation assay, in both pancreatic cancer cell lines.
The interaction between ABT-737 and TRAIL was shown to be

a control for protein loading. B, the effect of ABT-737 (0–20 Amol/L; 48 h)
treatment on cell viability was determined and compared between cells
transduced with Mcl-1 shRNA or control shRNA.

We found that ABT-737 can enhance a TRAIL-mediated Bax
conformational change. Release of free Bim has been shown to
activate Bax to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL (25).
In this regard, recent data indicate that Bim acts directly on
Bax/Bak, which are anchored in the mitochondrial outer
membrane, as shown by the observation that a Bim, but not a
Puma BH3, peptide was sufficient to induce oligomerization and
activation of Bax and Bak to permeabilize the mitochondrial
membrane (25). Furthermore, the function of Bim through either
Bax or Bak has been shown in thymocytes from Bim/Bax or
Bim/Bak double-knockout mice (30). Studies indicate that TRAIL
preferentially uses Bax over Bak for the induction of mitochondrial apoptotic events (31). Evidence suggests that Bak can be
activated by its displacement from Bcl-xL by BH3-only proteins
(32). Accordingly, we studied the interaction between Bak and
Bcl-xL and found that ABT-737 can untether Bak from Bcl-xL in
PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cell lines, suggesting that this effect may
contribute to the ability of ABT-737 to enhance TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.
Studies indicate that ABT-737 is unable to target Mcl-1, and thus
Mcl-1 reduces responsiveness to ABT-737 (33). The effect of TRAIL
on Mcl-1 expression remains controversial. In this regard, Han et al.
(15) have shown that TRAIL can induce Mcl-1 degradation and a
caspase-mediated disruption of the Mcl-1:Bim complex. In
contrast, Ricci et al. (22) found that TRAIL can induce Mcl-1
expression through activation of nuclear factor nB. At the dose of
TRAIL used in our experiments, Mcl-1 expression was up-regulated,
consistent with data suggesting that this occurs via activation of
nuclear factor nB (22). We also observed that ABT-737 may upregulate Mcl-1 levels. Potentially, this reflects stabilization of Mcl-1
due to its binding to Bim that has been displaced from Bcl-xL or
Bcl-2 by ABT-737 (34).
Importantly, we show that Mcl-1 knockdown in PANC-1 cells
enhanced caspase-3 activation and increased cytotoxicity by
ABT-737. This result is consistent with studies showing that
Mcl-1 suppression can sensitize tumor cells to ABT-737 (33). Abundant Mcl-1 proteins in our pancreatic cancer cells and the marked
sensitization produced by Mcl-1 shRNA suggest that increased
cytotoxicity may be achieved by strategies to down-regulate Mcl-1.

In this regard, the pan Bcl-2 antagonist Obatoclax (GX15-070)
has been shown to inhibit Mcl-1 and may therefore show greater
enhancement of therapeutic efficacy (35). The BH3-mimetic
GX15-070 synergizes with bortezomib in mantle cell lymphoma
by enhancing Noxa-mediated activation of Bak (35).
We also evaluated the combination of ABT-737 and gemcitabine.
At similar doses of ABT-737 that were used in combination with
TRAIL, we found that ABT-737 can significantly augment the
cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine in both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cell
lines. These data show the relevance of our findings to
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.
In summary, we show that the disabling of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 by
ABT-737 results in the release of Bim and Bak from prosurvival
Bcl-2 proteins to induce apoptosis. ABT-737 also enhanced a
TRAIL-induced Bax conformational change. Together, these
mechanisms underlie the ability of ABT-737 to augment TRAILinduced apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells. Whereas
Mcl-1 can reduce susceptibility to TRAIL (14, 33), ABT-737
treatment was sufficient to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
despite its low affinity for Mcl-1 (13). These findings underscore
the potent proapoptotic effects of Bim and Bak release from
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins to enhance TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Experiments in other TRAIL-resistant cell lines are awaited
to determine whether responsiveness to the combination of ABT737 and TRAIL can be generalized. As reported here, our data
provide compelling evidence that targeting both the extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathways is a potentially effective and novel
therapeutic strategy. Our findings may contribute to the rational
design of combinatorial regimens against pancreatic cancer and
other malignancies.
