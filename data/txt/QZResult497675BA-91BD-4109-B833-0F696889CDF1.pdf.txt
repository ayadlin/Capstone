ABSTRACT
Background: Despite advances in molecular medicine over recent decades,
there has been little advancement in the treatment of osteosarcoma. We performed
comprehensive molecular profiling in two cases of metastatic and chemotherapyrefractory osteosarcoma to guide molecularly targeted therapy.
Patients and Methods: Hybridization capture of >300 cancer-related genes plus
introns from 28 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer was applied to >50 ng of
DNA extracted from tumor samples from two patients with recurrent, metastatic
osteosarcoma. The DNA from each sample was sequenced to high, uniform coverage.
Immunohistochemical probes and morphoproteomics analysis were performed, in
addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization. All analyses were performed in CLIAcertified laboratories. Molecularly targeted therapy based on the resulting profiles
was offered to the patients. Biomedical analytics were performed using QIAGEN’s
Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis.
Results: In Patient #1, comprehensive next-generation exome sequencing
showed MET amplification, PIK3CA mutation, CCNE1 amplification, and PTPRD
mutation. Immunohistochemistry-based morphoproteomic analysis revealed c-Met
expression [(p)-c-Met (Tyr1234/1235)] and activation of mTOR/AKT pathway [IGF1R (Tyr1165/1166), p-mTOR [Ser2448], p-Akt (Ser473)] and expression of SPARC
and COX2. Targeted therapy was administered to match the P1K3CA, c-MET, and
SPARC and COX2 aberrations with sirolimus+ crizotinib and abraxane+ celecoxib.
In Patient #2, aberrations included NF2 loss in exons 2–16, PDGFR` amplification,
and TP53 mutation. This patient was enrolled on a clinical trial combining targeted
agents temsirolimus, sorafenib and bevacizumab, to match NF2, PDGFR` and TP53
aberrations. Both the patients did not benefit from matched therapy.
Conclusions: Relapsed osteosarcoma is characterized by complex signaling and
drug resistance pathways. Comprehensive molecular profiling holds great promise for
tailoring personalized therapies for cancer. Methods for such profiling are evolving
and need to be refined to better assist clinicians in making treatment decisions based
on the large amount of data that results from this type of testing. Further research
in this area is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

of adjuvant chemotherapy, a routine CT scan showed a
3.5 × 3.5–cm nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung and a
2.0 × 2.5–cm nodule in the right middle lobe, representing
distant relapse of the osteosarcoma (Figure 1). Despite
treatment with high-dose ifosfamide (1 cycle at 14 g/m2),
the disease progressed and the patient subsequently
developed a pneumothorax. He received another course of
cisplatin and doxorubicin, and although the pneumothorax
resolved, there was evidence of continued progression of
his intrathoracic metastases. He subsequently underwent
thoracotomy of the left lung with upper lobe resection and
metastectomy. The final pathology report revealed at least
40 foci of tumor in the resected lung tissue. This tumor
tissue was sent for comprehensive molecular profiling to
identify potential targeted therapy options. The patient was
referred to the molecular treatment planning group.

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary
malignant tumor in children, adolescents, and young
adults [1]. It comprises a group of mesenchymal boneforming tumors with multiple histologic subtypes,
including osteoblastic, chondroblastic, fibroblastic,
and unconventional. The biology of osteosarcoma is
complex, and treatment options have remained essentially
unchanged for several decades [2]. Since the 1980s, frontline treatment for primary osteosarcoma has consisted of
induction chemotherapy followed by surgery for patients
with non-metastatic disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy is
also given. Options are even more limited for patients
with relapsed osteosarcoma. A recent Phase II study of
sorafenib and everolimus represents the first positive
study for relapsed osteosarcoma in decades, but even this
study did not reach statistical significance for the primary
outcome [3]. Radium 223 di-chloride, an alpha particle,
may be another potential treatment option for patients with
osteoblastic metastases [4, 5].
In the era of precision medicine, the molecular
profile of a patient’s tumor can be determined readily and
can be matched to a targeted therapy in real time. This
presents an opportunity to systematically analyze an
individual patient’s tumor and offer them personalized
therapy [6]. With few advancements in treatment and the
dismal prognosis for patients with relapsed, refractory
disease, osteosarcoma patients may benefit from deep
molecular, genomic sequencing and comprehensive
molecular profiling [2, 6]. As a demonstration of this
approach, we performed comprehensive molecular
profiling of two patients with metastatic osteosarcoma
and matched their profiles to molecularly targeted therapy.
Here we report the results of this profiling and discuss the
implications and limitations of this approach.

Patient #1: next-generation exome sequencing
Next-generation sequencing by FoundationOne
identified four genomic aberrations: MET amplification,
PIK3CA V344G mutation, CCNE1 amplification, and
a loss of function mutation in PTPRD (S1845f*). Our
institutional 46-gene panel confirmed the PIK3CA V344G
mutation. Caris Target One gene profiling revealed
positivity for TLE3 (2+, 80%), androgen receptor
(1+, 60%), TS, RRM1, and PTEN. Further testing was
negative for ERCC1, MGMT, TOPO1, ER/PR, and SPARC.
FISH analysis revealed no amplification in Her2/neu or
TOP2A. P1K3CA and BRAF were wild type by sequencing
for hotspot alterations. Genetic testing results for Patient
#1 are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.

Patient #1: immunohistochemistry based
morphoproteomics analysis and therapy
Immunohistochemistry-based morphoproteomic
analysis showed constitutive activation of the c-MET
pathway in the tumor cells to a mild degree, as
evidenced by the expression of phosphorylated (p)-cMet (Tyr1234/1235) in the cytoplasmic compartment
(0 to 1+ with a rare 2+ chromogenic signal on a scale
of 0 to 3+) (Figure 2). The insulin-like growth factor
(IGF) pathway was expressed with 1+ to 3+ signal in the
cytoplasmic compartment of total IGF-1R (Tyr1165/1166).
Furthermore, there was moderate expression of PKC-alpha
(up to 3+ in both the cytoplasmic and plasmalemmal
compartments). The ras/Raf kinase extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) pathway was constitutively
activated in the form of phosphorylated p-ERK 1/2
(Thr202/Tyr204). Also present was constitutive activation
of the mammalian target of rapamycin C2 (mTORC2)
pathway as evidenced by the expression, with nuclear
subcellular compartmentalization, of p-mTOR [Ser2448]
with concomitant expression of its upstream effector
p-Akt (Ser473). The activation of mTORC2 coincides

RESULTS
The patients’ clinical histories, molecular profiling
results, and targeted therapy are summarized here.

Patient #1
This 21-year-old male was found to have
chrondroblastic osteosarcoma of the right distal
femur in 2011. Upon diagnosis, he began treatment
with standard first-line chemotherapy comprising
methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MAP). He
experienced immediate relief from pain with the initial
cisplatin and doxorubicin infusions. He then underwent
limb salvage surgery, and pathologic review showed
his resected tumor to have 80% necrosis. He received
postoperative chemotherapy because of his high-risk
status and was closely monitored with periodic computed
tomographic (CT) scans. Nine months after completion

with both downstream signaling from the IGF-1R pathway
and strong PKC-alpha expression [7, 8].
The biological pathway networks evoked by IPA
from the molecular profiles were reviewed for potential
targeted therapy options. Of the six biological pathway
networks evoked, only one differentiated the patient from
the control. In the patient, there were losses of control
pathway interactions with insulin and follicle stimulating
hormone, and there were gains of interactions with MYC, a
key transcription regulator in cancer. Of particular interest
was the potentially strong influence of PROP1 on the
patient’s network, possibly to lower the concentration of
beta-catenin (CTNNB1). PROP1 encodes a transcription
factor in the pituitary gland. Seven drugs were considered
for therapy: 1-alpha25 (OH)2-vitamin D3, celecoxib,
gemcitabine, lovastatin, melatonin, metformin, and nabpaclitaxel. As can been seen in (Figure 3), these drugs
provided coverage of the patient’s pathway network.
Given that the PIK3CA V344G mutation was an
activating one, Patient #1 was started on metformin and

rapamycin therapy, and the response was characterized
as stable disease. The c-MET amplification seen in the
exome sequencing was confirmed by IHC, and thus the
patient also received crizotinib, a c-MET/ALK and ROS1
inhibitor. Unfortunately, his disease progressed on the
crizotinib, rapamycin, and metformin combination. He
was evaluated for another specific c-MET inhibitor study,
but that study required a washout period of 4 weeks. Given
the aggressive clinical course of his disease, he was started
on gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel therapy on the basis of
the SPARC expression identified on morphoproteomic
profiling. Celecoxib was added because of the COX2
expression in the IHC specimen. Unfortunately, his disease
continued to progress and he eventually died of his disease.

Patient #2
This 16-year-old male was found to have a tumor
in the left proximal tibia with anterior cruciate ligament
tear. After biopsy of the tumor, osteoblastic osteosarcoma

analysis of two patients’ cases offers insight into the
complex biology of high risk osteosarcoma.
In Patient #1, c-MET amplification was shown
by exome sequencing, and there was evidence that
downstream activation of related pathways contributed to
the growth of this patient’s tumor. MET overexpression has
been demonstrated to convert primary human osteoblasts
into osteosarcoma [10]. The Met/HGF receptor has been
shown to be overexpressed in human osteosarcomas
and is activated by either a paracrine or an autocrine
circuit, and therefore might play a role in aggressive
osteosarcomas [11]. HGF activates both the mitogen
and “motogen” machinery in human osteosarcoma cell
lines, and this is related to activation of the ERK and Akt
pathways [12]. P-ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and p-Akt
(Ser473) were expressed in this patient’s tumor (Figure 2).
A small-molecule Met inhibitor, PF2362376, inhibited
phosphorylation of Met, Erk, and Akt while inhibiting the
proliferation of canine osteosarcoma cell lines and induced
cell death at biologically achievable concentrations, and
further was found to block activities associated with
Met signaling, including migration, invasion, branching
morphogenesis, and colony formation in soft agar [13].
In the morphoproteomic laboratory, the phosphospecific probe for tyrosine 1234/1235 was used to assess
the state of phosphorylative activation of c-Met in Patient
#1′s tumor cells; it detected 0 to 1+ (rare 2+) staining
intensity on a scale of 0 to 3+. This is a relatively low
level of expression of the constitutively activated c-Met
pathway. The Caris profile, furthermore, did not show
c-MET amplification by FISH. One of the reasons could
be tumor heterogeneity.
The PIK3CA missense mutation V344G was
detected in Patient #1′s tumor by exome sequencing by
two different laboratories. This may represent an activating
mutation and thus contribute to PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
signaling. This was further reflected in the constitutive
activation of the mTOR signal transduction pathway
in the tumor. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been
reported to contribute to osteosarcoma progression [14].
The confirmed presence of MET amplification and p-ERK
and p-AKT by IHC prompted the patient’s treatment with
crizotinib and rapamycin, but unfortunately he did not
have a significant clinical response to this combination.
The CCNE1 amplification identified in Patient #1′s
tumor by FoundationOne next-generation sequencing is
important in that it encodes the cyclin E1 protein (which
regulates G1 to S phase transition) via binding to and
activating cyclin-dependent protein kinase 2 (cdk2).
This protein complex has a direct role in initiation of
replication and overall maintenance of genomic instability
[15]. This particular amplification was reported in 27%
of osteosarcomas (6/22) in one study, and was directly
correlated with increased cyclin E1 expression, but it does not
correspond with chemotherapy response rates [16]. There are
no approved therapies that target the CCNE1 amplification,
but clinical trials of cdk2 protein inhibitors are underway.

was diagnosed. The patient received neoadjuvant standard
MAP chemotherapy according to the protocol AOST0331
regimen, but he was not officially enrolled in the trial.
The patient underwent rotationplasty with surgery that
revealed tumor necrosis greater than 95%, with negative
margins. He then continued the MAP chemotherapy
and developed bilateral hip and groin pain that did not
respond to conservative management. An MRI of the left
hip suggested a tumor focus, and biopsy showed highgrade metastatic osteosarcoma. The patient began therapy
with liposomal doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate
with zoledronic acid. A follow-up positron emission
tomographic–CT scan showed progression of disease in the
left femur and right hip. He was referred to MD Anderson
for treatment on a clinical trial of the alpha emitter radium
223 (http://ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01833520) [4]
and was enrolled on the protocol. After one dose his disease
progressed. He then received two cycles of ifosfamide, but
his disease continued to progress. The patient underwent
left leg amputation due to progressive disease. The patient
was presented at treatment planning meeting after he was
found to have progression on ifosfamide.

Patient #2: next-generation sequencing
and therapy
Patient #2 had a comprehensive genomic profile that
showed loss of NF2 exons 2–16, PDGFRA amplification,
C17orf39 amplification, RB1 loss, and TP53 loss. The
patient’s Variant of Unknown Significance report showed
the following aberrations: CUX1 L509V, GPR124 A1090P,
RAD50 V842A, FANCD2 amplification, HGF R328H,
VHL amplification, FGF14 rearrangement, IL7R E392K,
FLCN amplification, and PCLO P1027T. The PDGFR
amplification was confirmed by IHC, showing 90%
PDGFRα positive (3+ expression in 90% of tumor cells).
Patient #2 was presented at the molecular treatment
planning meeting at MD Anderson. On the basis of
his molecular profile, the patient was enrolled in a
Phase I clinical trial (http://ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT01187199) of bevacizumab and temsirolimus in
combination with sorafenib for the treatment of advanced
cancer [9]. The patient tolerated the therapy reasonably
well, with the exception of grade 2 mucositis and grade 1
fatigue. Re-staging scans revealed multiple new bilateral
lung opacities with minimal FDG activity, suggesting
metastases. There also were new FDG-avid right hilar
and left bronchial nodes and a new focus of FDG activity
within the left scapula, also suggesting metastasis. Because
of progressive disease, he was taken off the clinical trial.
The patient elected to receive best supportive care.

molecular profiling, and molecularly matched therapy for

The PTPRD S1845fs*2 mutation detected in
Patient #1′s tumor is an altered tumor suppressor gene
that dephosphorylates the oncoprotein Stat3 [17],
thus inactivating it. There are no approved treatments
or clinical trials focused on PTPRD. However, the
increased Stat3 activity induced by this mutation is a
potential target, as clinical trials of inhibitors of Stat3 are
underway. Interestingly, somatic and germline PTPRD
mutations have been noted in Ewing sarcoma, another
bone sarcoma that occurs in children and young adults. In
a small study that sequenced the tumors of a few patients,
it was intriguing that PTPRD germline aberrations
conferred clinical benefit to patients with Ewing sarcoma
who received therapy directed at the IGF1R and mTOR
pathway [18].
After failure of crizotinib and rapamycin in
Patient #1, additional morphoproteomic analysis was
done that showed SPARC and COX2 expression. The
patient then was started on a combination of gemcitabine,
nab-paclitaxel, and celecoxib on the basis of these
findings. Nab-paclitaxel binds to tubulin and stabilizes
it, leading to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis [19, 20].
By stabilizing beta-tubulin, the taxanes sequester Smad3
and reduce TGF-beta signaling [20]. Nab-paclitaxel’s
uptake is facilitated by SPARC [21–23], which was
highly expressed in the patient’s tumor, suggesting that
the tumor may have been sensitive to this cytotoxic
agent. In a xenograft model of human osteosarcoma with
high SPARC expression, nab-paclitaxel showed a tumor
inhibition rate of 98.8%, which was greater than those of
doxorubicin (46.1%) or paclitaxel (40.8%) [24].
The sensitivity of tumor cells to taxanes can be
enhanced by metformin via downregulation of p38MAPKdependent ERCC1. Metformin inhibits both the mTORC1
pathway and components of the mTORC2 pathway
(expressed in this patient’s tumor) by activating AMPK
[25]. It also inhibits the tumorigenic FASN pathway [25,
26], which was expressed in Patient #1′s tumor and has
previously been associated with aggressive lung metastasis
in osteosarcoma [27]. In vitro, metformin inhibits the
mevalonate pathway and leads to increased cytotoxicity
of anticancer drugs in an additive manner against human
osteosarcoma cells [28]. It decreases the capacity of
advanced glycation end products to upregulate the
expression of RAGE in osteoblastic cells [29] and thereby
could contribute to downregulation of the tumorigenic
ERK pathway [30]. This is relevant to the observation
that S100A7 promotes the migration and invasion of
osteosarcoma cells via the receptor for advanced glycation
end products [31].
In spite of the interrelated targetable pathways in
Patient #1′s tumor, his cancer continued to progress. The
lack of clinical benefit of the targeted therapy combinations
may be attributable to the identified aberrations not being
the driver aberrations or to the drugs chosen off-label not
being the best ones to target the aberrations. Perhaps a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

specific P13K inhibitor or a more potent c-MET inhibitor
could have yielded a more favorable response. These
suggestions are speculative, but they reflect the complex
biology of relapsed osteosarcoma biology, which may
entail activation of multiple drug resistance pathways.
In Patient #2, the potential actionable aberrations
included NF2 loss and PDGFRA aberration. Merlin,
encoded by NF2, functions by coordinating signaling of
receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), with cell contact; the inactivation
of Merlin in cancer disrupts this mechanism and leads to
unrestrained receptor tyrosine kinase signaling despite cell
contact [32]. Any alteration that results in the partial or
complete loss of the FERM domain (amino acids 22–311)
or the NF2 C-terminal moesin domain (aa 532–595) is
predicted to cause a loss of function [33, 34]. Therefore,
the alteration observed in this tumor is expected to cause
a loss of function. The NF2 mutation was not reported
in 14 osteosarcomas analyzed (COSMIC, Aug 2014).
Mice heterozygous for NF2 develop a variety of cancers,
including osteosarcomas [35], although neurofibromatosis
2 patients do not normally develop osteosarcomas,
nor are mutations in NF2 frequently found in human
osteosarcoma samples [36]. At present, there are no
approved therapies that directly target NF2 loss. However,
preclinical studies in models of NF2 loss have suggested
that the mTOR inhibitors may be a relevant approach [37].
The mTOR inhibitors everolimus and temsirolimus have
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for other cancer types and are under clinical
investigation in solid tumors [38].
PDGFRA encodes platelet-derived growth factor
receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha), a tyrosine kinase receptor
that, upon binding of cognate ligands (PDGFA or PDGFB),
activates several signaling pathways, including PI3K and
MAPK11. PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations,
translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have
been associated with various malignancies, leading to
consideration of their protein products as oncoproteins
[39]. PDGFRA alterations have not been reported in
any of the 54 osteosarcoma cases analyzed (COSMIC,
Nov 2014). PDGFR-alpha expression was reported in
4–90% of osteosarcomas, but its expression was not
correlated with overall or disease-free survival [40, 41].
Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the PDGFRalpha and Beta proteins, as well as other kinases, are FDAapproved for other indications. These agents, including
imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib,
regorafenib, ponatinib, and pazopanib, are currently in
clinical trials for patients with various solid tumor types.
PDGFRA activation leads to activation of the PI3K/
Akt and mTOR pathways [42]. Therefore, PI3K and
mTOR pathway inhibitors may be relevant in a tumor with
PDGFRA amplification. The mTOR inhibitors everolimus
and temsirolimus are FDA-approved for other indications
and remain under investigation in multiple solid tumor types.

Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which
is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive
advanced cancers [43]. Germline mutations in TP53 are
associated with the very rare Li-Fraumeni syndrome and
the early onset of many cancers, including osteosarcoma
[44]. TP53 mutations have been reported in 27% of
osteosarcomas (COSMIC, October 2014). Interestingly,
it has been shown that, among patients with advanced
cancer, those whose tumor had a TP53 mutation
had a longer progression-free survival interval on a
bevacizumab-containing regimen than those whose tumor
had a wild-type TP53 [45].
These aberrations directed us to choose for Patient
#2 a clinical trial of the combination of sorafenib,
bevacizumab, and temsirolimus. Even this targeting of
multiple pathways with a cocktail of drugs, however,
was not able to overcome the complex biology of
osteosarcoma. mTOR inhibitors were used in combination
with other targeted therapies. It has been shown that mTOR
inhibitors can overcome primary and/or acquired resistance
to various tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal
antibodies in various malignancies [9, 18, 46, 47].
Cancers like melanoma have frequent aberrations
of the BRAF gene in more than 50% of patients and
have three US FDA approved drugs targeting the BRAF
V600 E aberration. Non-small cell Lung cancer is now
a heterogenous disease with EGFR, BRAF, Her2/Neu
aberrations or ALK, ROS1, RET or FGFR fusions [48–
52]. These cancers are examples of recurrent driver
aberrations with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the clinic
that are useful to act upon these genes. Even in these
cancers although these genes are considered dominant
drivers and frequently have exceptional responses to
kinase inhibitors, resistance eventually develops. In
fact, resistance mutations have been described with
every kinase inhibitor [53]. Resistance mechanisms are
complex and can be innate and / or acquired in the same
kinase domain or through another mechanism upstream
or downstream [18, 54]. Relapsed osteosarcoma is a
highly aggressive disease and has an extremely complex
biology. The clinical next generation sequencing and the
IHC based profiling have their own limitations in terms
of the genes or proteins tested. Firstly osteosarcoma
is a disease that bears the stamp of chromothripsis
arising from a single cellular catastrophic event than
accumulation of aberrations over time. The aberrations
that arise from this crisis are thus unpredictable other than
TP53 which is till date one of the undruggable genes [55].
Secondly, the patients were given targeted therapy after
chemotherapy refractory disease when the biology of the
tumor and the drug resistance mechanisms are complex.
Thirdly, we did not have active drugs in the clinic against
several of the proteins tested eg: WNT pathway inhibitor
or Glioma-associated oncogene protein (Gli2) pathway
inhibitor. Fourthly, there is intra-tumoral and inter-tumoral
heterogeneity. The metastatic sites of the disease would
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

probably have a different biology when compared to the
primary and secondary sites which was profiled. Lastly,
there was a recent study published that showed the lack
of efficacy of molecularly targeted agents outside of their
approved indications did not improve progression-free
survival when compared to physicians choice in advanced
cancer patients [56]. So it may be that it may have not
been the right drug to the right target at the right time
and single kinase inhibitors may work only in rare cancer
subsets. Moreover, most of the hallmarks of cancer are
controlled by signaling networks at the cellular level
that need a strategy combing kinomics, proteomics, drug
screening with novel approaches using a comprehensive
translational approach in appropriate models including
patient derived xenograft models, genetically engineered
mouse models and co-culture systems, more than the
clinical next generation sequencing and IHC based
approaches we have used.
One of the limitations of this study is that the
patients were not tested for programmed cell death
ligand 1 (PDL1) expression. PDL1 was recently shown
to correlate with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in a
subset of osteosarcoma patients [57, 58]. Given the
increasing portfolio of agents targeting PD-1/PDL1,
targeting this immune checkpoint may be an option for
osteosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We identified two patients with relapsed, metastatic
osteosarcoma who presented for targeted therapy
options to the Clinical center for targeted therapy at The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Their
clinical information was obtained through review of their
medical records. Treatment, consent and patient treatment
on targeted therapy or on the investigational trial and
data collection were performed in accordance with the
guidelines of The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Molecular profiling of tumor samples
The patients’ tumor samples were subjected
to molecular profiling by next-generation exome
sequencing of 186 cancer genes by the Illumina platform
(FoundationOne, Boston, MA); by “Caris Target Now”–
based molecular profiling (Caris Life Sciences, Irving, TX)
that included immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH), and sequencing; by a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certified
MD Anderson Cancer Center next-generation sequencing
46-gene panel. In addition immunohistochemistry and
morphoproteomics analyses were performed. These
methods have been previously published [18, 59–61].

Author contributions

The case scales from the morphoproteomic analysis
were weighted and normalized to a set of profile scores
according to a biomedical analytics algorithm customized
for the pathologist. The scores, along with the Uniprot
IDs of the measured analytes, were analyzed through
the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis
(IPA®, QIAGEN Redwood City, http://www.qiagen.com/
ingenuity) to evoke the most likely biological pathways.
A “Control” profile, consisting of the same Uniprot IDs
without scores, was also created to minimize search bias
in the IPA data mining. The patient’s evoked pathway
networks were then compared with those of the control,
and evoked molecules unique to the tumor were identified.
The interactions of proposed drugs with the identified
disease-related biological pathway network(s) were then
highlighted.

CONCLUSION

REFERENCES

We report a comprehensive genomic profile
and proteomic analysis of two patients with recurrent,
metastatic osteosarcoma. Although potential targetable
genomic alterations were identified in both tumors,
these patients did not derive clinical benefit from the
treatments chosen to target their cancer. Osteosarcoma is
a heterogenous disease with a high degree of intratumoral
variability. Although there is great promise in personalized
medicine, these cases highlight the need for alternative,
more effective approaches to guiding treatment decisions
in this disease given the large volume of data generated by
molecular profiling. Future measures exploring the unique
biology and molecular pathogenesis of rare tumors may
pave the way for the development of more specific and
effective targeted therapies.
