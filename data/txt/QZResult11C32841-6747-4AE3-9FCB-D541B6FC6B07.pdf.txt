BACKGROUND: Although >70% of younger women with nonmetastatic breast cancer (BC) received adjuvant chemotherapy, only approximately 15% to 20% of elderly women with BC received chemotherapy. The
decision to treat may be associated with nonmedical factors, such as patient, physician, or practice characteristics. In the current study, the association between oncologist characteristics and the receipt of chemotherapy in elderly women with BC was evaluated. METHODS: Women aged >65 years who were diagnosed
with American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I to III BC between 1991 and 2002 were identified in the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. The Physician Unique Identification Number was linked to the American Medical Association Masterfile to obtain information on oncologists. Investigated was the association between demographic, tumor, and oncologist-related factors and the receipt of
chemotherapy, using Generalized Estimating Equations to control for clustering. Patients were defined as
low risk (estrogen/progesterone receptor positive, stage I/II disease) and high risk (estrogen/progesterone
receptor-negative, stage II/III disease). RESULTS: Of 42,544 women identified, 8714 (20%) were treated
with adjuvant chemotherapy. In a hierarchical analysis, women who underwent chemotherapy were more
likely be treated by oncologists primarily employed in a private practice (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.23-1.59) and who graduated after 1975 (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26) and were less
likely to have an oncologist trained in the United States (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93). The association
between a private practice setting and the receipt of chemotherapy was found to be similar for patients at
high risk (OR, 1.55) and low risk (OR, 1.35) for cancer recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly women with BC
treated by oncologists who were employed in a private practice were more likely to receive chemotherapy.
Efforts to determine whether these associations reflected experience, practice setting, insurance type,
or other economic incentives are warranted. Cancer 2009;115:3848–57. Published 2009 by the American

Private Practice and Breast Cancer Treatment/Hershman et al

One of the most important advances of medical oncology over the past 30 years has been the gradual refinement
through large-scale randomized trials of the use of adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer. Professional
guidelines dating back to the late 1990s recommended
that chemotherapy be considered for all women with invasive breast cancer, especially those with positive lymph
nodes or estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors.1-3
These guidelines for chemotherapy use are related to the
risk of disease recurrence. Assessment of risk has traditionally been based on the patient’s menopausal status, tumor
stage, and tumor characteristics. The use of chemotherapy
for small, hormone receptor-positive cancers is less clearcut and involves choices by the patient and physician and
shared decision making.
The elderly are generally under-represented in clinical trials. Because of the uncertain benefit of chemotherapy, elderly women are less likely to receive adjuvant
chemotherapy compared with younger women.4-8 Studies
that used the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER)-Medicare database have demonstrated an
improvement in survival for some women aged >65 years
with early stage breast cancer who were treated with chemotherapy.7-9 Although there were slight differences, overall
the studies found an approximate 25% survival benefit for
women with lymph node-positive, hormone receptor-negative cancers, after controlling for multiple confounding
variables. The use of chemotherapy decreased with increasing age, black race, and increased comorbidity, and use
increased with year of diagnosis, tumor size, number of
positive lymph nodes, and higher tumor grade. No benefits
were observed for patients with lymph node-negative disease or for patients with hormone receptor-positive cancers.7,8 Because it is also now known that elderly patients
treated on cooperative group clinical trials experience
reductions in breast cancer mortality and recurrence similar to younger patients, the identification of modifiable factors that influence the undertreatment of high-risk and the
overtreatment of low-risk elderly women is necessary.10
Research on the determinants of receipt of cancer
treatment has focused for the most part on patient-related
factors, such as race/ethnicity, geographic location, age, and
socioeconomic status (SES). To our knowledge, relatively
less research has evaluated the role of the physician and
practice setting in the receipt of cancer care. In this study,
we used the SEER-Medicare database to investigate the

association between oncologist characteristics such as gender, type of degree, year of graduation, and practice setting
(private vs nonprivate) and the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy for elderly patients with early stage breast cancer.
We determined patterns of use both in patients at high risk
and those at low risk for a breast cancer recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Database
We used the SEER-Medicare linked database, which was
codeveloped by the US National Cancer Institute and the
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The SEER
Program represented roughly 14% of the US population
in 1991, and since 2000, has represented approximately
26%. Medicare covers hospital services, physician services,
some drug therapy, and other medical services for >97%
of persons aged >65 years. The linked SEER-Medicare
database contains clinical, demographic, and medical
claims data on patients aged >65 years and is a unique
population-based resource for longitudinal epidemiologic
and health outcomes studies. Its characteristics and validation have been comprehensively reported elsewhere.11,12
To obtain information on the characteristics of
the physicians who treated the SEER-Medicare patients,
we used the Unique Physician Identification Number
(UPIN) to link the Medicare claims with the American
Medical Association (AMA) Masterfile, as described elsewhere.13 This file contains data collected from physician
members of the AMA, including gender, age, medical
degree (Doctor of Medicine [MD] or Doctor of Osteopathy [DO]), location of medical school (United States vs
foreign), year of graduation, employment setting (private
vs nonprivate), and specialty.13 Physicians records are
continuously updated and verified by the AMA.14

Patient Selection
We initially identified all female Medicare participants
aged >65 years who were diagnosed with American Joint
Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage I to III breast cancer
from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2002, who
had undergone either a lumpectomy or mastectomy within
90 days of diagnosis (n ¼ 61,867). We then selected
patients who underwent consultation with an oncologist
3849

Original Article

within 1 year after diagnosis (n ¼ 42,544). We used Medicare claims to identify patients who had initiated chemotherapy within 6 months after surgery. Women who were
not members of a health maintenance organization
(HMO) and had Medicare Parts A and B during the 12
months before their diagnosis and until death/censoring,
and women who had a prior breast cancer or other cancer,
end-stage renal disease, or a breast cancer diagnosis without histologic confirmation were excluded.
A subset of the patients were categorized according
to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) guidelines. Patients were classified as having a
high risk of disease recurrence if they had tumors that
were estrogen and progesterone receptor negative and had
stage II or III cancer (n ¼ 2947). Patients with a low risk
of disease recurrence were defined as hormone receptor
positive and having stage I or II disease (n ¼ 28,859).

linked databases and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
procedure codes, Current Procedural Terminolgy-4
(CPT-4), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), and ICD-9-CM V codes. These codes
have been found to capture virtually all breast cancer
cases.15
We categorized patients as having had chemotherapy exposure in the Medicare files using codes for ICD-9CM diagnosis, ICD-9-CM procedure code, CPT,
HCPCS, and revenue center codes. We included codes
v581, v662, v 672, E9331, E9307, 9925, Q0083,
Q0084, Q0085, and CPT codes for the administration of
chemotherapy 96,400 through 96,499 and 96,500
through 96,599 J9000 through J9999; diagnosis-related
group code ¼ 410 and revenue center codes ¼ 0331,
0332, and 0335.

Oncologist Characteristics

Socioeconomic Status of Patients

Oncologist characteristics that were analyzed based on the
variables in the AMA Masterfile included gender, year of
graduation (<1975 or 1975; approximately 50% cutpoint), primary employment setting (private vs other),
location of training (United States vs other), and type of
degree (MD or DO). Private primary employment setting
was defined as self-employed solo, 2-physician, or group
practice (practice codes: 011, 013, 021, and 030). Other
employment settings included medical school, nongovernment hospital, and governmental hospital or Veterans
Administration hospital. In our sample, only 6% of physicians had missing data for this category. Physician age was
categorized by decade of birth. Physicians’ patient volumes (ie, total number of claims for breast cancer patients
in the database for 1992-2002) were dichotomized as 1 to
40 versus >40 patients. We defined high patient volume
as an oncologist who consulted on >40 patients in the
sample. We chose this cutoff because it represented the
top 10% of the oncologists with regard to numbers of
patients from this cohort who underwent chemotherapy
treatment based on the distribution of consultations.

We generated an aggregate SES score based on education,
poverty, and income data from the 2000 census track
data, following the method adapted by Du et al.16
Patients were ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 scale, in which 1
was the lowest value, based on a formula incorporating
these variables weighted equally. The 394 patients with
missing data were assigned to the lowest SES category.
The results did not change if they were assigned to a separate category. In the final analysis, the first and second
rankings were combined.

Measurement of Treatments and Outcomes
We identified and categorized patients with respect to the
chemotherapy they received using the SEER-Medicare
3850

Comorbid Disease
To assess the prevalence of comorbid disease in our
cohort, we used the Klabunde adaptation of the Charlson
comorbidity index.17,18 Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims were searched for ICD-9-CM diagnostic
codes. Each condition was weighted, and patients were
assigned a score based on the Klabunde-Charlson index.18

Statistical Analysis
The chi-square test was used to compare oncologistrelated, demographic, and clinical characteristics between
patients who received chemotherapy and those who did
not and between patients who consulted with an

oncologist in private practice versus those who consulted
with an oncologist in another practice setting. Univariate
odds ratios (ORs) were calculated individually for each
variable. All hypothesis tests were 2-sided.
The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) methodology was introduced by Zeger et al19 to deal with clustering in data that otherwise would be analyzed by means
of a generalized linear model, and GEEs (PROC GENMOD in SAS statistical software [SAS Institute, Inc, Cary,
NC]) have become an important strategy in the analysis of
correlated data.19,20 We used GEEs to account for the correlations of outcome measures among patients who had
the same physician. The unit of analysis was the patient.
For each patient, the physician’s unique UPIN number
was used as the clustering variable. The model assumptions
were the data had a binomial distribution, the link function was logit, and the type of variance was exchangeable.
We evaluated the odds of chemotherapy for all the
categories of each variable, controlling for all the other
variables in the model. The model included the following:
1) oncologist characteristics (gender, type of degree, country of training, practice type, and patient volume); 2)
patient demographic variables (age, race, place of residence, marital status, and SES); and 3) clinical variables
(tumor grade, AJCC stage, hormone receptor status, and
comorbidity score). We also performed separate analyses
for the high-risk and low-risk recurrence groups. All statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS system for
Windows (version 9.13).

RESULTS
We identified 42,544 women in the SEER-Medicare
database who were diagnosed with stages I to IIII breast
cancer during the study period and who met our eligibility
criteria. A total of 2833 oncologists consulted on these
patients. We defined 28,859 patients as being at low risk
for recurrence, 4366 of whom (15%) received chemotherapy, whereas 2947 patients were defined as being of high
risk, 1791 of whom (61%) received chemotherapy. Overall, 20% of women in the cohort received chemotherapy,
with chemotherapy use increasing from 8% to 34%
between 1992 and 2002. The oncologists who administered chemotherapy to these patients were predominantly
male (80%), in private practice (72%), trained in the
United States (72%), and holders of a medical degree

(MD) (97%) as opposed to an osteopathic degree (DO).
Only the number of female oncologists and the number
of oncologists who graduated after 1975 was found to
increase over time (Fig. 1).
Table 1 reports the odds of the receipt of chemotherapy across individual demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients and the characteristics of the
oncologists. Patients consulting with an oncologist who
had primary employment in a private versus nonprivate
practice, who was foreign trained as opposed to US
trained, or who graduated after 1975 as opposed to
before, were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Oncologists in private practice were more likely to be
male, have a larger patient panel, and have graduated
before 1975 (Table 2).
Controlling for known demographic and clinical
confounders, a lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy was observed among patients with a US-trained versus
a non–US-trained oncologist (OR, 0.83; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.74-0.93 [P ¼ .001]), but a greater
likelihood of receiving chemotherapy with an oncologist

in private versus nonprivate practice was noted (OR, 1.40;
95% CI, 1.23-1.60; [P < .0001]) (Table 1). Receipt of
chemotherapy was also associated with younger age at
diagnosis, higher SES, less favorable tumor characteristics,
more recent year of diagnosis, fewer comorbid conditions,
and being married.
To evaluate patterns of care in patients at low risk
and high risk for disease recurrence, we conducted separate GEE analyses of the association between oncologist
practice and the receipt of chemotherapy among patients
Cancer

stratified into 2 groups by risk of disease recurrence (high
risk and low risk) (Table 3). The association between primary practice type and use of chemotherapy was found to
be similar for patients with a high risk (OR, 1.55) and
those with a low risk (OR, 1.35) of disease recurrence.

Private Practice and Breast Cancer Treatment/Hershman et al

elderly women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
increased from 8% to 34% between 1992 and 2002, with
61% of high-risk patients and 15% of low-risk patients
undergoing chemotherapy. The results of the current
study demonstrate that patients treated by physicians who
have their primary employment in a private practice are
more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy for early
stage breast cancer. This correlation holds both for
patients with high and low risks of disease recurrence. In
addition, we confirmed that, after controlling for physician characteristics, the clinical and demographic characteristics known to influence treatment also influenced
adjuvant chemotherapy use in our model.
Research on the determinants of receipt of cancer
treatment has focused for the most part on patient factors
such as race/ethnicity, geographic location, age, and SES.
In the current study, we also found that younger age,
being married, and high SES were all associated with a
greater likelihood of receiving chemotherapy. Although
we found that black women were more likely to receive
chemotherapy in the unadjusted analysis, the association
disappeared in the adjusted analysis. This finding is consistent with other studies in this patient population.7 Conversely, to our knowledge relatively little research has
evaluated the role of oncologist characteristics in cancer
treatment decisions. Investigators have reported the composite influence of the physician’s characteristics on the
receipt of androgen–deprivation therapy for patients with
prostate cancer21 and radiation after breast conservation
surgery,22 as well as on referral to an oncologist after a diagnosis of colon23 or lung cancer.24 It is increasingly apparent that patients with similar demographic and clinical
characteristics may be treated differently depending on
the physician they consult.25,26 To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have investigated the influence of
physician and practice setting.
We were surprised to observe the strong and consistent correlation between practice setting and chemotherapy use independent of physician characteristics, and were
even more surprised to find that this association was similar both for patients with a clear indication due to high recurrence risk, as well as for those who were likely to have
only minimal benefit. What might explain this association? One possibility may relate to patient volume,
because the oncologists in private practice generally had a
higher patient volume, which may then translate into a

greater comfort level treating elderly patients. However,
the association between panel size and chemotherapy use
was weak and did not modify the association with practice
setting. Another possibility is that it is related to patient
selection factors. Patients may choose to see physicians for
chemotherapy in private settings due to convenience, and
patients with more complicated medical conditions may
be treated at university hospitals and clinics in which they
are less likely to receive chemotherapy; therefore, these
results may be a product of selection bias. However, many
of these biases are controlled for in the multivariate analysis. Another possibility is that it is related to patients’ insurance status. Patients seen in a private practice setting
are, in general, more likely to have private insurance and
to be of higher SES. Although all of the patients in the
current study cohort had Medicare coverage and were not
covered under an HMO, physician practice patterns may
be influenced by the type of patients in the overall practice. Research has shown that payment mechanisms influence physicians’ clinical decision making,27 that
physicians are more likely to recommend services for
insured than for uninsured patients,28 and that salaried
versus fee-for-service reimbursement influences physician
behavior.29 In a survey of medical oncologists, the majority of physicians reported that out-of-pocket costs could
influence chemotherapy decisions; however, only 30%
reported that costs had actually influenced their treatment
decisions.30 In another survey, only 16% of oncologists
acknowledged omitting treatment options on the basis
of their perceptions of a patient’s ability to afford
treatment.31
A less honorable possibility is that recommendations
for chemotherapy are influenced by financial reimbursement and personal compensation that ensues from chemotherapy administration. An issue that has plagued
oncology is the conflict of interest that ensues from the
administration of chemotherapy drugs. Many practices
buy chemotherapy drugs at discounted prices, and then
administer these drugs in the office. Profit is generated
from the difference between what is paid for the drug and
what is charged to insurers and government programs.
Some estimates indicate that oncologists in private
practice make the bulk of their practice revenue from
chemotherapy concessions.32 Although the majority of
oncologists are motivated by patient desires, the potential
for a conflict of interest in the system has raised concerns,
3855

and has resulted in proposals to regulate the reimbursement system.32
Patients also play a large role in the ultimate decision
to undergo treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy. Acceptance of adjuvant chemotherapy by a woman with
breast cancer occurs often after an assessment of risk and
benefit, a process referred to as shared decision making.
Although there are some patients with a low recurrence
risk who are willing to accept a very small benefit despite
the risk of treatment–related complications, there are
others who clearly benefit due to the higher risk of disease
recurrence and the NCCN guidelines recommend chemotherapy. A recent study found that only 45% of 4395
women with early stage breast cancer received treatment
that was consistent with NCCN guidelines. The authors
concluded that the reasons for low adherence to guidelines
were multifactorial and included insufficient health system supports to clinicians, inadequate organization and
delivery systems, and ineffective continuing medical education.33 Similarly, a recent study of 275 women with
early stage breast cancer found that 16% of patients who
should have received adjuvant chemotherapy did not.34
Studies have shown that chemotherapy use in the elderly
decreases with increasing age, number of comorbid conditions, and favorable tumor characteristics.5
The current study has some weaknesses. The SEERMedicare dataset that we used for these analyses does not
include data regarding several variables that might have
also been associated with the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, such as psychologic outlook, communication
with the physician, or health behaviors, and specific
contraindications, such as performance status. However,
given the very large size of our sample, these unmeasured
variables are often correlated with the variables used
in the analysis and are unlikely to have a significant
influence on the point estimates. It is also possible that
there was some misclassification of the private practice
variable. In addition, incomplete billing in medical
centers or government hospitals could also result in
biased results.
The results of the current study have demonstrated a
small but independent association between both the
oncologist’s primary practice setting and location of medical training and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in
women with localized breast cancer, regardless of the risk
for breast cancer recurrence. We believe this study adds
3856

significantly to the limited investigation of the influence
of practice setting and physician characteristics on treatment. To improve the quality of cancer care, efforts to
determine whether these associations reflect experience,
education, practice setting, insurance type, or other economic incentives are warranted.
