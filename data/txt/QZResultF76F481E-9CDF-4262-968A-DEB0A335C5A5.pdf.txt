Abstract
Uterine leiomyomata, or fibroids, are benign tumors of the
uterine myometrium that significantly affect up to 30% of
reproductive-age women. Despite being the primary cause of
hysterectomy in the United States, accounting for up to 200,000
procedures annually, the etiology of leiomyoma remains largely
unknown. As a basis for understanding leiomyoma pathogenesis and identifying targets for pharmacotherapy, we conducted
transcriptional profiling of leiomyoma and unaffected myometrium from humans and Eker rats, the best characterized
preclinical model of leiomyomata. A global comparison of
mRNA from leiomyoma versus myometrium in human and rat
identified a highly significant overlap of dysregulated gene
expression in leiomyomata. An unbiased pathway analysis
using a method of gene-set enrichment based on the sigPathway
algorithm detected the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway as one of the most highly up-regulated
pathways in both human and rat tumors. To validate this
pathway as a therapeutic target for uterine leiomyomata,
preclinical studies were conducted in Eker rats. These rats
develop uterine leiomyomata as a consequence of loss of Tsc2
function and up-regulation of mTOR signaling. Inhibition of
mTOR in female Eker rats with the rapamycin analogue WAY129327 for 2 weeks decreased mTOR signaling and cell proliferation in tumors, and treatment for 4 months significantly
decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity, and size. These results
identify dysregulated mTOR signaling as a component of leiomyoma etiology across species and directly show the dependence of uterine leiomyomata with activated mTOR on this
signaling pathway for growth. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6171–8]

Introduction
Uterine leiomyomata, or fibroids, are benign tumors of the
uterine myometrium and occur in up to 77% of reproductive-age
women (1). Clinically significant leiomyomata occur in 30% of
these women (1), resulting in a spectrum of gynecologic symptoms,
including menorrhagia/anemia, pelvic pain/pressure, dyspareunia,
and, in some cases, reproductive dysfunction. Leiomyomata are the

primary cause of hysterectomy in the United States, accounting for
up to 200,000 procedures annually.
Despite its prevalence, the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomata
is unknown. It has been suggested that leiomyomata grow under
the control of ovarian steroids and their receptors and growth
factors (such as epidermal growth factor, insulin growth, factor and
their binding proteins, and transforming growth, factor-h; ref. 2).
Nonetheless, the factors that promote both the initial development
and subsequent in vivo growth remain poorly understood. Toward
the goal of understanding the pathogenesis of leiomyomata,
multiple studies have been performed to identify genes that are
dysregulated in leiomyoma versus normal myometrium. Compilation of all such microarray data has led to the identification of
genes involved in broad pathways, such as retinoid metabolism,
growth and proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix
maintenance (3).
The limited number of animal models for this disease has also
hindered the advancement of leiomyoma research. Models have
been published in several species, including mouse (4–6), rat (7),
guinea pig (8–10), and potbellied pig (11). The Eker rat, first
described in 1954 as a rodent model of renal cell carcinoma, was
subsequently observed to develop spontaneous uterine leiomyomata in f65% of female rats by 16 months of age (12, 13). The
predisposing genetic alteration was identified as an endogenous
retroviral insertion in the Tsc-2 tumor suppressor gene (14, 15).
Consistent with Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis of tumorigenesis,
leiomyomata develop in rats heterozygous for the Eker mutation
(Tsc2Ek/+) through spontaneous inactivation of the remaining wildtype allele (7). Eker rat leiomyomata share phenotypic, biochemical,
and genetic characteristics with the cognate human disease, including estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, responsiveness
to steroid hormones, aberrant HMGA2 expression, overexpression of
insulin-like growth factor-I, and the protective effects of pregnancy,
making it potentially the best rodent model of leiomyoma.
Here, we report the most extensive microarray study to date
using matched human leiomyoma versus myometrium from 23
patients and the first cross-species microarray analysis of rat leiomyoma versus myometrium. Comparison of the two speciesspecific data sets and bioinformatic analysis of these microarray
data identified the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway as one of the most highly up-regulated pathways in leiomyomata from both species. Because mTOR is central to the ability
of a cell to integrate external signals such as growth factors, nutritional status, and stress to direct proliferation (16, 17), the discovery
that this pathway is dysregulated in leiomyomata was both
provocative and sensible. In vivo and in vitro studies confirmed

activation of the mTOR signaling pathway in leiomyomata, and
treatment of Eker rats with the rapamycin analogue WAY-129327
inhibited mTOR signaling and decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity, and size. These data show the important role of mTOR
signaling in leiomyoma etiology and the potential pharmacotherapeutic opportunities for targeting this pathway in the treatment of
this disease.

Materials and Methods
Rat tissue collection. The care and handling of rats was in accordance
with NIH guidelines and conducted in Association for the Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited facilities. All animal
studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Fifteen leiomyoma and 16
myometrium samples were collected from 12- to 17-mo-old female Eker
rats (Long Evans; Tsc-2Ek/+), including four matched tumor/normal pairs.
Samples were immediately frozen at 80jC until RNA was isolated.
Human clinical study design. All human studies were performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved
by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committees of

Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland; Meharry Medical College,
Nashville, TN; and Quorum Review, Inc., Seattle, WA. This multicenter,
nontreatment, clinical study was initiated to collect uterine leiomyoma and
normal myometrial biopsy specimens from premenopausal patients
undergoing standard-of-care hysterectomy for uterine leiomyomata.
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before any
study-related procedure.
Twenty-three women were enrolled in the study. Mean demographic data
are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Study eligibility of each subject
was confirmed by medical and reproductive history, vital signs, medication
use, a physical and gynecologic examination including pap smear, and
various laboratory assessments including hematology, serum chemistry,
HbA1c, serum estradiol, and serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels.
Following confirmation of subject eligibility, up to three specimens (1 cm3
each) of leiomyoma and normal myometrium were collected from each
subject at the time of hysterectomy. Information on location of tumor, size
of tumor, and menstrual phase were noted at the time of sample collection
(Supplementary Table S2). Samples were immediately frozen at 80jC until
RNA was isolated.
RNA preparation and hybridization. RNA extraction, isolation, and
labeling was performed as previously described (18). For rat samples, 10 Ag
of cRNA were fragmented and hybridized to GeneChip Rat Genome 230

2.0 arrays according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix). For human
biopsies, 10 Ag cRNA were fragmented and hybridized to GeneChip Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Raw data can be found in the GEO database
as accession GSE13319.7
Differentially expressed probe sets. All analysis methods are detailed in
the Supplementary Methods. Briefly, loess normalized signal values were
tested for differential expression between leiomyomata and myometrium
using CyberT (19) for the rat data set, and Bioconductor’s LIMMA package
(20) for the human data set. Using a false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of
0.001, 5,834 and 2,222 probe sets were determined to be significantly
differentially expressed in rat and human, respectively. The range of
significant fold changes was 0.014 to 78.5 for rat and 0.08 to 22.3 in human.
Determination of homologous qualifiers. Affymetrix probe set
annotations8 were used to assign Entrez Gene IDs to each probe set.
Bayesian t statistics for probe sets querying the same gene were averaged
together to obtain gene-level t statistics and FDR values (Supplementary
Table S3). To compare between species, 11,263 orthologous rat-human gene
pairs were obtained using National Center for Biotechnology Information’s
Homologene (build 63; ref. 21; see Supplementary Methods for details).
Identification of significantly regulated gene sets. Significantly
regulated biological pathways were identified using an internal R implementation of the sigPathway algorithm (22) incorporating specific modifications as detailed in the Supplementary Methods. Selected gene sets
from the Broad Institute’s MSigDB collection (23) were tested. A gene set
was considered significant when FDR(NTk) V 0.01 and FDR(NEk) V 0.01 for
each of the human and rat leiomyoma versus normal comparisons. Eightyeight gene sets passed these cutoffs (Supplementary Table S4) and were
called differentially expressed in both human and rat.
Assessment of mTOR dysregulation in individual fibroid samples. A
method was devised to estimate the fraction of human leiomyoma samples
with mTOR dysregulation from the transcriptional profiling data set. For
each leiomyoma sample, we calculated the fraction of rapamycin–downregulated probe sets with higher expression in that leiomyoma relative to
the donor-matched myometrium sample. The distribution of these fraction
values over all leiomyomata was then compared with values generated from
random gene sets (see Supplementary Methods).
Antibodies and Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was
performed with phospho-S6 (1:2,000), phospho-S6K (1:500), S6 (1:1,000),
S6K (1:1,000), or 4EBP1 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technologies) followed by
streptavidin horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. As a loading control, blots were
stripped and reprobed with an antibody to g-tubulin (1:5,000; Sigma).
ELT3 proliferation data. ELT3 cells (derived from a leiomyoma of the
Eker rat) were maintained as described (24). For the proliferation assay, cells
were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1,200 per well in 50 AL basal
medium (24). After a 3-h incubation, 50 AL fresh basal medium containing
vehicle (0.2% DMSO) or 2 WAY-129327 in 0.2% DMSO were added to each
well without removing basal medium. Cells were incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2
for 3 d without replacing the medium. Cell proliferation was measured
using a CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit as per
manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). WAY-129327 was obtained from the
Wyeth Research compound dispensary.
In vivo studies. For the 2-wk (biomarker) study, nineteen 15-mo-old
female Eker rats (Tsc2Ek/+) were treated with daily i.p. injections of
0.5 mg/kg WAY-129327 (n = 8) or vehicle (n = 11). For the 4-mo (efficacy)
study, 12-mo-old female Eker rats (Tsc2Ek/+) were treated with daily i.p.
injections of 0.5 mg/kg WAY-129327 (n = 44) or vehicle (n = 47). For
both studies, the compound was prepared daily in a 5% Tween 80/5%
PEG-400/4% ethanol vehicle. Rats were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation
followed by pneumothorax, and uteri were removed, fixed in 4% phosphatebuffered formalin, and paraffin embedded. Grossly visible uterine lesions
were measured and divided before processing. One portion was fixed for
histology and the other portion was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western

analysis. H&E-stained slides of uterine horns from all animals were
microscopically evaluated for the presence of uterine leiomyomata.
Immunohistochemistry. Slides were incubated with anti-phosphorylated
(serine 235/236) S6 ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-Ki67
(DAKO) at a dilution of 1:50 in PBS containing 10% normal goat or horse
serum overnight at 4jC. A biotin-labeled secondary antibody was conjugated
for 30 min at 37jC. Sections were stained using avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex from the DAKO Cytomation LSAB2 System
(DAKO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Controls that lacked
primary antibody were incubated in 1 PBS with 10% goat serum in each
experiment. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) staining was performed with the FragEL DNA Fragmentation
Detection kit (Calbiochem) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Ki67 and
TUNEL labeling indices were scored by assessing the number of cells positive
for Ki67 nuclear antigen or TUNEL/100 cells counted.

Results
Identification of genes dysregulated in uterine leiomyoma
tissue. Differential expression of genes between leiomyoma and
uninvolved myometrial tissue was determined in human clinical
samples and in the Eker rat model of leiomyomata. Analysis was
restricted to 11,263 genes that had orthologous sequences on the
arrays from both species. We identified 1,543 regulated genes in
human samples (FDR V 0.01; Fig. 1) of which 1,069 showed a similar
direction of change in the rat (578 of these passed FDR V 0.01).
Comparing the t statistics of differential gene expression between

leiomyomata and myometrium in human versus rat resulted in a
positive Pearson correlation coefficient of 23% (Fig. 1B). Although
seemingly small in magnitude, this correlation coefficient is highly
statistically significant, indicating overall positive concordance
between the two data sets. Included in the genes that show similar
regulation in both species are glutamate ionotropic receptor 2,
calpain 6, matrix metalloproteinase 11, and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Human-rat pathway analysis. We identified dysregulated gene
sets in human and rat leiomyomata using a method of gene set
enrichment (22) and an a priori defined set of genes derived from
the Broad Institute’s MSigDB collection (23). NTk and NEk scores
were independently calculated for both human and rat data. We
identified 88 gene sets that were significantly regulated (FDR <
0.01) in both the rat and human, with all 88 showing concordant
direction of change between human and rat. A comparison of the
NTk scores generated from human and rat showed a Pearson
correlation of 55% (Fig. 1C). Consistent with what is known about
the etiology of uterine leiomyomata, our analysis of dysregulated
gene sets indicated that in both species, altered cell cycle regulation, increased extracellular matrix production, and altered amino
acid metabolism were characteristics of these tumors.
One of the most highly up-regulated gene sets (overall rank = 13) in
both the rat and human included a set of genes that is downregulated following treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
(ref. 25; Fig. 2A), suggesting that altered mTOR signaling was a feature
of uterine leiomyomata. Of the genes in this gene set satisfying a FDR
V 0.1 cutoff for differential expression, 86% of them were upregulated. Based on the human microarray data, we estimated the
percentage of human leiomyomata with increased mTOR signaling
at the transcriptional level by analyzing the human microarray
data using two independent data sets that identified rapamycin–

down-regulated genes (Rap_down gene sets; refs. 25, 26). Evaluation of
our human microarray data using these Rap_down gene sets suggests
that an estimated 73% to 75% of human leiomyomata have
dysregulated mTOR signaling (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Inhibition of mTOR signaling by WAY-129327. To test the
hypothesis that mTOR signaling contributed to the growth of
uterine leiomyomata, we conducted an initial set of experiments
in vitro using the rapamycin-related mTOR inhibitor WAY-129327
(see Fig. 3A for structure) and a rat leiomyoma–derived cell line,
ELT3 (24). Treatment of ELT3 cells with 10, 50, or 100 nmol/L WAY129327 inhibited phosphorylation of the downstream mTOR target
S6K and its effector S6 and resulted in a dose-dependent decrease
(IC50 6.8 F 0.92 nmol/L, n = 14) in cell proliferation (Fig. 3B and C).
To evaluate mTOR signaling as a potential therapeutic target,
efficacy of WAY-129327 inhibition of mTOR signaling (at 2 weeks
and 4 months) and impact on growth uterine leiomyomata in vivo
(at 4 months) was determined. Fifteen-month-old Eker rats were
treated with WAY-129327 for 2 weeks to evaluate target engagement
(i.e., inhibition of mTOR signaling). Immunohistochemical staining
for pS6 confirmed activation of mTOR signaling in vehicle-treated
Eker rat leiomyomata, and treatment with WAY-129327 resulted in
complete inhibition of mTOR signaling in these tumors (Fig. 4).
Whereas 100% (16 of 16) of the vehicle tumors were positive for
phospho-S6, 0% (0 of 13) of the WAY-129327–treated tumors
exhibited phospho-S6 immunoreactivity (P < 0.001, m2 analysis;
Supplementary Table S5). This result was confirmed by Western
analysis of tumors, which showed decreased phosphorylation of
S6 and S6K in WAY-129327–treated tumors, with no change
in total levels of these proteins (Fig. 5 and data not shown). 4EBP1 phosphorylation, however, was not decreased, consistent
with published results that this phosphorylation may have
differential sensitivity to rapamycin analogue treatment (refs. 27,

or WAY-129327 (WAY ) for 2 wk or 4 mo. H&E sections show histology and adjacent sections were stained for pS6. Vehicle-treated sections stain strongly positive for
pS6 whereas tissue from WAY-129327–treated tumors is negative, indicating inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway.

28; Supplementary Fig. S3). Inhibition of mTOR signaling correlated
with decreased cell proliferation at this 2-week time point, with the
Ki67 proliferative index decreasing from 21% to 2.8% in vehicle
versus WAY-129327–treated cells, respectively, although no change
was observed in apoptotic index as measured by TUNEL staining
(Supplementary Table S5).
The ability of WAY-129327 to block mTOR signaling and inhibit
cell proliferation in leiomyoma cells in vitro and in vivo suggested
that this mTOR inhibitor could be efficacious for treatment of these
tumors. To test this experimentally, Eker rats were treated with
WAY-129327 or vehicle for 4 months. As shown in Table 1, the tumor
incidence was significantly reduced from 76.6% (36 of 47) in vehicletreated rats to 38.6% (17 of 44; P < 0.0001 Fisher’s exact test) with
WAY-129327 treatment. An impact was also observed on large
tumors, with the incidence of grossly observable tumors decreasing
from 34% (16 of 47) to 11% (5 of 44; P = 0.056 Fisher’s exact test) with
WAY-129327 treatment. Additionally, tumor multiplicity was also
significantly decreased from 1.41 to 0.55 tumors per rat (P < 0.001
t test) and tumor size, which for grossly observable tumors was
reduced from an average of 3.9 cm3 in vehicle-treated animals to

metric Wilcoxon two-sample test). As with the 2-week treatment, the
4-month apoptotic indices were unchanged, whereas the proliferative index of leiomyoma cells decreased from 22.4% to 3.2% (P < 0.01
t test; Supplementary Table S5).

Discussion
Despite the prevalence of uterine leiomyomata, the pathogenesis
of this tumor type remains unclear. Attempts to understand uterine
leiomyomata etiology have included epidemiologic (29), cytogenetic,
and microarray investigations of human leiomyomata versus
unaffected uterine myometrium. Cytogenetic studies led to the
identification of common chromosomal rearrangements involving
hormone-regulated gene products such as fumarate hydratase,
aromatase, and the high mobility group proteins (30). However,
chromosomal rearrangements are not consistently found in all
tumors and no firm link has been established between these
hormone-regulated genes and uterine leiomyoma tumorigenesis.
Investigations into the role of steroid hormones have led to a
better, albeit incomplete, understanding of the role of estrogen and
progesterone in leiomyoma pathogenesis and to the development of

progesterone receptor antagonists, selective progesterone receptor
modulators, and selective estrogen receptor modulators as putative
therapies (31, 32).
Expression profiling has become the method of choice toward
understanding the etiology of uterine leiomyomata. Published human studies include smaller matched sample sets (3) or unmatched
samples of leiomyoma and myometrium (33). Within this collection
of expression profiling data, challenges lie in interpreting the
different studies due to variation in patient demographics and
treatment modalities, technology platforms, statistical methods, and
data presentation. The present study includes matched leiomyoma
and unaffected myometrium from 23 medically naı̈ve patients—the
largest study of matched samples to date. Despite the challenges of
comparing microarray studies, many genes reported to be dysregulated in previous work were also differentially expressed in our
data set. These genes, including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1);
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1); cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A); CD24 molecule (CD24); cellular retinoic acid
binding protein (CRABP2); cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61
(CYR61); dermatopontin (DPT); doublecortin (DCX); glutamate
receptor, ionotropic AMPA2 (GRIA2); insulin-like growth factor II,
transforming growth factor, h receptor II (TGFBR2); transforming
growth factor, h3 (TGFB3 ); tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3
(TIMP3 ); matrix metallopeptidase 14 (MMP14); and mesoderm

specific transcript homologue (MEST1 ), involve broad pathways
such as retinoid metabolism, growth and proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix maintenance.
The experiments reported here were also designed to evaluate
the Eker rat as a model of human leiomyomata and identify overlapping systems/pathways at work in these tumors. A global
comparison of mRNA from leiomyoma versus myometrium in human
versus rat resulted in a highly significant overlap of regulated genes
(correlation of 0.23). Our estimation of the correlation is likely to be
lower than actual, because some probe sets on the arrays could be
potentially be mistargeted, nonfunctional, or target alternative splice
forms. Although the correlation may seem low, it is consistent with
previously published cross-species analyses. The t statistic correlation for genes expressed in estradiol-treated vaginal tissue from
human and rat is reported to be 0.33 (34) and McCarroll and
colleagues (35) determined a t statistic correlation of 0.15 in the
transcriptional response to aging in flies versus worms, which they
note to be highly significant. Thus, an f23% correlation coefficient
is within the expected value range.
Single gene analyses have been conducted previously in uterine
leiomyomata and, although highly significant and suggestive, are
unable to capture all tumor-associated changes in biological pathways. For cross-species comparisons, gene-by-gene comparisons
have been used to highlight similarities in disease models based on
the principles that important biological processes are more likely
to be conserved, but these comparisons use relatively small data
sets compared with the vast amount of data generated by global
analysis. Furthermore, comparisons across species can be complicated by differences in regulatory mechanisms, a problem that can
be circumvented by grouping genes into sets consisting of
predetermined functional or related categories and identifying
trends within a given gene set. Here, an unbiased pathway approach was performed for human and rat uterine leiomyomata
using high-content data sets to identified pathways dysregulated
in leiomyomata of both species, demonstrating the power of
cross-species comparisons. For example, genes involved in cell
signaling and control of the cell cycle pathways such as TGFBR3
and CDKN1A are up-regulated in leiomyomata from both species,
as are extracellular matrix component genes such as the
collagens [collagen, type IV (COL4A2), type V (COL5A2), and
type VI (COL6A1)] and some matrix metalloproteinases (MMP10,
MMP7, MMP11, and MMP14). Wnt signaling pathway genes
including WNT inhibitory factor (WIF1 ), WNT1 inducible
signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), and dickkopf homologue
2 (DKK2) are also up-regulated in both species. In the retinoic
acid pathway, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, CRABP1/2, and ADH1 were
also aberrantly expressed.

Expression Profiling of Human and Rat Leiomyomata

One pathway of particular interest that was identified by this
approach is the mTOR pathway. As noted earlier, mTOR is a
downstream protein kinase in the phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase/
AKT pathway and is a central modulator of many cell processes
(including cell proliferation) in response to various cellular stimuli
(as reviewed in refs. 16, 17). Dysregulation of this pathway has been
implicated in a variety of pathologic conditions including metabolic syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiac hypertrophy, neurologic disorders, and more recently, benign proliferative
disorders such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis, tuberous sclerosis
complex syndrome, and uterine leiomyomata. We compared our
expression data to two independent data sets that identified genes
down-regulated by rapamycin in B-lymphoma cells or in Tsc-2 null
mouse embryo fibroblasts (25, 26). These two studies represent
diverse biological backgrounds yet significantly correlated with the
mTOR signature seen in uterine leiomyomata, suggesting that the
effects of mTOR activation are a consistent feature associated with
dysregulation of this signaling pathway.
Tumors in the Eker rat arise due to inactivation of the Tsc-2
tumor suppressor, leading to unregulated mTOR signaling and cell
proliferation. As a result, Eker rats are predisposed to develop renal
cell carcinoma, splenic hemangiosarcoma, pituitary adenoma, and
uterine leiomyomata. In previously published work, inhibition of
the mTOR pathway by rapamycin reduced kidney tumor volume
and reversed symptoms of pituitary adenoma in the Eker rat (36),
demonstrating the dependence of these tumors on mTOR
signaling. Additionally, the data obtained here using the Eker rat
are consistent with human data obtained in other settings of mTOR
dysregulation. For example, treatment with rapamycin decreases
restenosis following angioplasty in vascular smooth muscle (37),
inhibits proliferation of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer
(38), and reverses estrogen-induced proliferation of uterine leiomyoma and myometrium-derived cell lines (39). However, targeting
mTOR as a therapeutic strategy for uterine leiomyomata has not
previously been examined in the clinic or in animal models.
Our determination that the mTOR pathway was up-regulated in
human leiomyomata was based on a global transcriptional analysis
that identified multiple rapamycin-sensitive genes as being upregulated in these tumors. Overall, this profile was observed in
f75% of the human tumors examined. We attempted to confirm
this pathway analysis at the protein level (pS6 phosphorylation using
Western analysis) but results were inconclusive (data not shown). S6
phosphorylation was increased in about a third of tumors tested,
with the remainder evenly split between decreased or no change in
phosphorylation. These apparently discordant results may be
explained by several possibilities. First, from a technical standpoint,
it is difficult to efficiently extract proteins from leiomyoma tissue

because a large proportion of the tumor is often highly fibrous and
acellular. Second, a pathway analysis is a more sensitive and
powerful tool than assessment of a single end point, as it measures
multiple end points across many pathways. As such, many changes,
even small but in concordant direction, register as significant,
whereas Western analysis measures a specific end point using a
method that is less precisely quantifiable. Third, many leiomyomata
grow slowly and may be expected to have a different pS6 profile than
faster growing malignant tumors. Clearly, given the positive
preclinical data obtained in this study with WAY-129327, the best
test of whether an mTOR inhibitor can benefit human patients
suffering from leiomyomata will be a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial, ideally one in which mTOR
activation can be incorporated into patient selection and/or used
as a biomarker of efficacy. As with any human study, a universal
response is not expected. In human, a diversity of risk factors
contributing to leiomyomata growth have been identified, including
genetic alterations, obesity, nulliparity, and race (2). Our expression
profiling data predict that in the majority of tumors, these
independent dysregulated pathways ultimately affect the mTOR
signaling cascade.
In conclusion, the current study has identified a wealth of
changes that occur at the molecular level in uterine leiomyomata in
both the human and Eker rat. These data lend additional confidence that the Eker rat is a reasonable model of the human
disease, a finding with the potential to facilitate future drug
discovery efforts. Importantly, our pathway-driven analysis of
microarray data, identification of dysregulated mTOR signaling in
uterine leiomyomata, and efficacy shown in the Eker rat with the
mTOR inhibitor WAY-129327 suggest that mTOR inhibitors may
hold promise as a medicinal therapy for this disease.
