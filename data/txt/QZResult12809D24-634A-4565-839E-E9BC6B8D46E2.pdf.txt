Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the
aberrant accumulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite recent
advancement in anti-myeloma treatment, MM remains an incurable disease. This study
showed higher intrinsic oxidative stress and higher Trx1 and TrxR1 protein levels in
MM cells compared to normal cells. Drug-induced Trx1 (PX-12) and TrxR1 (Auranofin)
inhibition disrupted redox homeostasis resulting in ROS-induced apoptosis in MM cells
and a reduction in clonogenic activity. Knockdown of either Trx1 or TrxR1 reduced
MM cell viability. Trx1 inhibition by PX-12 sensitized MM cells to undergo apoptosis
in response to the NF-кβ inhibitors, BAY 11-7082 and curcumin. PX-12 treatment
decreased the expression of the NF-кβ subunit p65 in MM cells. Bortezomib-resistant
MM cells contained higher Trx1 protein levels compared to the parental cells and PX12 treatment resulted in apoptosis. Thus, increased Trx1 enhances MM cell growth and
survival and exerts resistance to NF-кβ inhibitors. Therefore inhibiting the thioredoxin
system may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat newly diagnosed as well as
relapsed/refractory MM.

Introduction

and progression [6]. In response to increased reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels and their toxic effects, cells
have evolved a number of survival pathways, which
includes the expression of antioxidant molecules and
stress-response molecules. However, cancer cells exploit
this advantage and adapt to the enhanced oxidative stress
through an increased antioxidant capacity. Cancer cells
with higher intrinsic oxidative stress are more resistant
to the disruption of redox regulation compared to noncancerous cells [7].
The thioredoxin (Trx) system is one of the major
antioxidant systems that maintain the intracellular
redox homeostasis [8]. The Trx system is comprised of
thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), a cellular redox protein, thioredoxin
reductase 1 (TrxR1) enzyme, and NADPH. The Trx
system maintains cellular redox homeostasis by either
directly scavenging ROS [9] or by regulating several
redox enzymes [10, 11]. In addition, Trx1 also regulates
various redox-sensitive transcription factors by acting as

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer characterized
by aberrant accumulation of malignant monoclonal
plasma cells in the bone marrow. MM accounts for 2%
of all neoplasms and is the second most common form
of hematological malignancies [1]. There are a number
of chemotherapeutic agents that are being used as antimyeloma therapies, for example, the immunomodulator
thalidomide [2] and its derivative lenalidomide [3], and
a proteasome inhibitor bortezomib [4]. Despite such
advancements in anti-myeloma therapies, MM remains an
incurable disease with only a slight increase in the median
survival rate to 5 years [5]. Upon prolonged treatment
MM cells acquire resistance to the given treatment, and
thus relapse is inevitable. Therefore, novel therapeutic
approaches to treat MM are desperately needed.
Intrinsic oxidative stress is a hallmark of cancer that

a co-factor to reduce specific cysteine residues [12, 13].
Trx1 also acts as a growth factor that stimulates cancer cell
proliferation and tumor growth and inhibits spontaneous
and drug-induced apoptosis [14]. Expression of Trx1 is
upregulated in many human cancer types, correlating with
cancer cell proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance
[15-17]. Similarly, expression and activity of TrxR is
upregulated in many human cancer types [15, 18] and its
inhibition results in cancer cell apoptosis [19]. However,
there are no previous reports on the physiological and
therapeutic significance of the Trx family members in MM
and its survival.
Nuclear factor-кβ (NF-кβ) is a nuclear transcription
factor regulating the expression of various genes involved
in cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and inflammation.
The NF-кβ family is comprised of five members
including p50/p105 (NF-кβ1), p52/p100 (NF-кβ2), p65
(Rel A), c-Rel, and Rel B [20]. Under non-stimulating
conditions, NF-кβ binds a class of inhibitor proteins
called Inhibitor of кβ (Iкβ) [20]. Upon stimulation, Iкβ
undergoes phosphorylation and subsequent degradation by
the proteasome releasing NF-кβ, which then translocates
into the nucleus where it activates gene expression [21].
NF-кβ and its signaling pathways are constitutively
activated in MM cell lines as well as in patient myeloma
cells [22] and constitutive NF-кβ activity is required for
the pathogenesis of MM [23, 24]. While the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib inhibits NF-кβ signaling by
preventing the degradation of Iкβ, resulting in MM cell
apoptosis [25, 26], and significant improvement in terms
of disease control and patient survival [4, 27], upon
prolonged treatment myeloma cells become resistant to
bortezomib [28].
Being a critical redox regulator, Trx1 activates
several redox sensitive transcription factors including NFкβ. Under oxidative stress conditions, Trx1 increases the
DNA binding activity of NF-кβ subunits, enhancing NFкβ mediated gene expression leading to cell proliferation
and survival [29]. However, not much is known about the
interaction between Trx1 and the NF-кβ pathway in MM
cells.
The present study was designed to characterize the
role of Trx1 and TrxR1 in myeloma cell survival, growth,
and chemo-resistance. Our results show that higher Trx1
and TrxR1 expression levels correlate with myeloma
cell survival and growth, and protect MM cells against
increased intrinsic oxidative stress. Trx1 and TrxR1
inhibition results in ROS-induced apoptosis in MM cells.
Our data also demonstrate that inhibition of Trx1 using a
sub-lethal concentration of PX-12 sensitizes MM cells to
undergo cell death in response to NF-кβ inhibition. Results
show that Trx1 inhibition decreases levels of the NF-кβ
subunit p65 protein in MM cells. Moreover, the Trx1
inhibiting drug PX-12 induces apoptosis of bortezomibresistant MM cells. Thus, Trx1 may be an effective
therapeutic target either alone or in combination with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

other NF-кβ targeted therapies in the treatment of newly
diagnosed as well as relapse/refractory MM patients.

Results
Multiple myeloma cells have higher intrinsic
oxidative stress and an up-regulated thioredoxin
system
Increased oxidative stress is a hallmark of many
human cancer types, which leads to aberrant cancer growth
and proliferation [6]. The levels of intrinsic oxidative
stress were examined in MM cell lines (RPMI8226, U266)
and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
by analyzing the intracellular ROS levels. Both MM cell
lines have significantly higher ROS levels compared to
PBMCs (Figure 1A).
To examine whether MM cells have increased
antioxidant capacity, we first evaluated the expression
levels of Trx1 and TrxR1 in myeloma cells compared to
PBMCs. A gene expression omnibus dataset (GSE6477)
shows that both Trx1 (Figure 1B) and TrxR1 (Figure 1C)
are expressed at significantly higher levels in new and
relapsed myeloma patient cells compared to normal cells.
Western blot analysis confirmed higher protein levels of
Trx1 (Figure 1D) and TrxR1 (Figure 1E) in MM cell lines
compared to PBMCs.

Trx1 and TrxR1 inhibition reduces MM cell
proliferation and viability
To study the role of Trx1 and TrxR1 in the growth
and survival of MM cells, we used both chemical
inhibition and a knockdown approach. Auranofin reacts
with selenol-containing residues present in TrxR1, inhibits
its activity [30], and shows excellent anti-tumor activity
[19]. PX-12 inhibits Trx1 by irreversibly alkylating the
Cys73 residue [31] and has been shown to exert anti-tumor
activity [32, 33]. We used PX-12 and auranofin as tools
to study the cytoprotective functions of Trx1 and TrxR1
in MM cells. Treatment of RPMI8226, U266, and control
PBMCs with increasing concentrations of PX-12 (0-40
µM) (Figure 2A) and auranofin (0-8 µM) (Figure 2B) for
24 hours resulted in a marked inhibition of RPMI8226 and
U266 cell proliferation compared to PBMCs.
To ascertain if specific knock-down of Trx1 and
TrxR1 could reproduce the effect of drug-induced Trx1
and TrxR1 inhibition on MM growth, we used the Trx1antisense (Trx1-AS) plasmid DNA and TrxR1 specific
siRNA. Transfection of the Trx1-antisense plasmid
decreased Trx1 protein levels compared to the control
vector (Figure 2C and 2E) and reduced RPMI8226 (Figure
2D) and U266 (Figure 2F) cell viability by 50% after 2

and 3 days of incubation, respectively. Similarly, siRNA
against TrxR1 suppressed TrxR1 protein expression
compared to the control siRNA (Figure 2G and 2I) and
reduced RPMI8226 (Figure 2H) and U266 (Figure 2J) cell
viability by approximately 30-50% after 2 and 3 days of
incubation, respectively.

reduction in the number of colonies was observed at 10
µM PX-12 in RPMI8226 (Figure 3A and 3E) and 5 µM
PX-12 in U266 (Figure 3B and 3E). Similarly, 4 µM
auranofin treatment significantly decreased the number of
colonies in both MM cell lines (Figure 3C, 3D and 3F).
No colonies were observed in MM cells treated with 8
µM auranofin. No significant effect on colony number was
observed with lower concentrations of PX-12 or auranofin
(data not shown).

RPMI8226 and U266 cells with PX-12 (0-20 µM) for
24 hours showed a significant increase in the amount of
ROS at 5 µM PX-12 as indicated by H2DCFDA oxidation
(Figure 5A). To investigate the involvement of ROS, we
analyzed whether two antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) and ascorbic acid, protected MM cells against
PX-12-induced apoptosis. Treatment of both cell lines
with 5 µM PX-12, with or without 5 mM NAC, showed
that addition of NAC significantly abrogated the PX-12induced increase in ROS in both MM cell lines (Figure
S1). These results confirmed that Trx1 inhibition by PX12 increases intracellular ROS levels in MM. Moreover,
treatment of cells with NAC (5 mM) together with PX-12
(5 µM) significantly rescued MM cells from undergoing
cell death (Figure 5B) and also abrogated PX-12-induced
apoptosis in both myeloma cell lines (Figure 5C). Ascorbic
acid (AA) showed a similar protective effect, but was not
as effective as NAC (Figure S2).
We then investigated the effect of auranofin on
the intracellular ROS levels in MM cells. Treatment
of RPMI8226 and U266 cells with auranofin (0-4 µM)
significantly increased intracellular ROS levels in both
MM cell lines (Figure 5D). In addition, addition of 5
mM NAC to auranofin-treated RPMI8226 and U266
cells significantly rescued them from undergoing cell

death (Figure 5E) and apoptosis (Figure 5F). Addition of
ascorbic acid also showed a similar protective effect, but
was observed to be less effective than NAC (Figure S2).

Trx1 inhibition sensitizes myeloma cells to NFкβ inhibitors and decreases NF-кβ p65 protein
expression
Since MM cells have high NF-кβ activity, we
tested the effect of the NF-кβ inhibitors, BAY 11-7082
[35] and curcumin [36], on MM cell proliferation using
MTT assays. BAY 11-7082 had no effect on RPMI8226
cell proliferation, whereas U266 cell proliferation was
inhibited only at a higher concentration (10 µM) (Figure
6A). Curcumin reduced RPMI8226 and U266 cell
proliferation only at higher concentrations (10 µM and 20
µM) (Figure S3A). Our results also showed an increase
in Trx1 protein levels in BAY 11-7082-treated RPMI8226
and U266 cells (Figure S4). Thus, increased Trx1 levels
may be responsible for the decreased sensitivity of MM
cells to NF-кβ inhibitors.
We then aimed to investigate the role of Trx1
in the resistance of MM cells to NF-кβ inhibitors.
RPMI8226 and U266 cells were treated with a sub-lethal

concentration of PX-12 (2.5 µM), with or without 5 µM
BAY 11-7082, for 24 hours. Treatment with either PX-12
or BAY 11-7082 alone had no effect on cell proliferation.
However, co-treatment of MM cells with both PX-12 and
BAY 11-7082 significantly reduced RPMI8226 and U266
cell proliferation by 80% (Figure 6B). We then measured
apoptosis in RPMI8226 and U266 cells treated with either
PX-12 or BAY 11-7082 alone or in combination, which
showed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity (Figure
6C) when cells were treated with PX-12 and BAY 11-7082
together. To confirm the results observed with PX-12,
we used Trx1 knockdown using the Trx1-AS plasmid in
combination with BAY 11-7082, which reduced U266 cell
proliferation (Figure 6D). Similarly, treatment with either
PX-12 or 5 µM curcumin alone had no effect on MM cell
proliferation, but co-treatment with PX-12 and curcumin
significantly reduced RPMI8226 and U266 proliferation

by 40-45% (Figure S3B). Co-treatment with PX-12 and
curcumin also significantly increased caspase-3 activity
in RPMI8226 and U266 cells compared to treatment with
either PX-12 or curcumin alone (Figure S3C).
Trx1 enhances the DNA biding activity of NF-кβ
subunit p50 by reducing a cysteine at position 62 [29].
Based on this information, we investigated the effect of
Trx1 inhibition on the expression and localization of NFкβ subunit p65 in MM cells. Western blot results showed
that PX-12 treatment significantly decreased cellular
p65 protein levels, including in the nuclear and cytosolic
fractions, in a concentration dependent manner in both
MM cell lines (Figure 6E).

Discussion

Inhibition of Trx1 reduces proliferation and
induces apoptosis of bortezomib-resistant MM
cells

Despite the development of many anti-myeloma
therapies, to date MM remains an incurable plasma cell
malignancy [2-4] with drug resistance resulting in disease
relapse. Therefore, development of new anti-myeloma
therapies and strategies to treat drug-resistant MM patients
is desperately needed. Many of the currently available
anticancer drugs, including bortezomib, the most effective
anti-myeloma drug, induce apoptosis by increasing the
intracellular ROS levels and oxidative stress [37, 38].
However, cancer cells enhance their antioxidant capacity
in response to increased oxidative stress to escape the
toxic effect of drugs. Therefore, therapies that inhibit the
activity of antioxidants to disrupt redox homeostasis may
provide a more effective anti-myeloma therapy.
The role of redox proteins, Trx1 and TrxR1, in MM
pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, for the first time,
we reported the cytoprotective role of Trx1 and TrxR1 in
MM, and showed that disruption of intracellular redox
homeostasis by inhibiting either Trx1 or TrxR1 reduces

As MM cells acquire resistance to the bortezomib
upon prolonged treatment resulting in disease relapse,
we evaluated the effect of Trx1 inhibition on the growth
and survival of drug-resistant myeloma cells. We first
generated a bortezomib-resistant (BR) cell line (U266-BR)
from the highly-sensitive parental U266 cell line (Figure
7A). Trx1 protein levels were observed to be higher in
U266-BR cells compared to the U266 cells (Figure 7B).
We next examined the effect of Trx1 inhibition on the
survival of U266-BR cells. Treatment of U266-BR cells
with PX-12 for 24 hours significantly inhibited their
proliferation (Figure 7C). Moreover, PX-12 also increased
caspase-3 activity in U266-BR cells indicating that cells
have undergone apoptosis (Figure 7D).

We showed that inhibition of Trx1 resulted in decreased
protein levels of NF-κβ subunit p65 in MM cells.
Moreover, Trx1 inhibition has been shown to reduce the
clonogenic activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
[17]. Our findings showed that drugs inhibiting either
Trx1 or TrxR1 decreased the clonogenic activity in MM
cells. Interestingly, cells treated with 10 µM PX-12
resulted in the formation of larger colonies compared to
the non-treated cells, although 10 µM PX-12 treatment
reduced the number of colonies in both cell lines. MM
cell lines, including RPMI8226 and U266, and primary
MM tumor cells have been shown to possess a small side
population (SP) of the cells that exhibit more clonogenic
and tumorigenic capacity [51]. These SP cells possess
stem cell-like features and express high levels of ABC
transporter family (ABCB1 and ABCG2), which are
responsible for SP cell’s drug-resistance [34, 52-54].
Moreover, these SP cells have more clonogenic potential
and the colonies formed by SP cells are larger than the
colonies formed by non-SP cells [51, 55]. Based on
this information, we postulated that the larger colonies
observed in the samples treated with 10 µM PX-12 may
have formed from the SP cells present in RPMI8226 and
U266 cells, which may be resistant to PX-12. Thus, an
upregulated Trx system is linked not just to cancer cell
proliferation, invasion, metastasis, but also to clonogenic
activity.
This study, for the first time, highlights the
cytoprotective role of Trx1 in the resistance of MM cells
to NF-кβ inhibitors. We showed that Trx1-inhibited MM
cells become more sensitive towards the NF-кβ inhibitors
BAY 11-7082 and curcumin. BAY 11-7082 had no effect
on RPMI8226 cell growth at any concentrations, while
only higher concentrations of BAY 11-7082 reduced
U266 cell growth (Figure 6), and Trx1 protein levels
were markedly increased in response to BAY 11-7082
treatment in both MM cell lines. Similarly, only higher
concentrations of curcumin reduced RPMI8226 and U266
cell proliferation (Figure S3). Elevated levels of Trx1
have been implicated in the resistance of cancer cells
to several chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin,
docetaxel, and doxycycline [16, 56]. Inhibition of Trx1
has been shown to reverse the drug-resistance in many
cancer types [17]. We hypothesized that high levels of
Trx1 observed in myeloma cells may exert cytoprotection
against NF-кβ inhibitors. Our data showed that inhibition
of Trx1 using a sub-lethal concentration of PX-12 (2.5
µM) sensitized MM cells to undergo apoptosis in response
to BAY 11-7082 (Figure 6) or curcumin (Figure S3). The
amount of cell death and caspase-3 activity was higher in
cells treated with PX-12 and BAY 11-7082 or curcumin
together compared to the treatment with either PX-12 or
BAY 11-7082 or curcumin alone. Specific knockdown of
Trx1 using the antisense Trx1 plasmid produced similar
results (Figure 6). Thus, Trx1 inhibition sensitized MM
cells to NF-кβ inhibitors suggesting that increased Trx1

MM cell growth and survival. Our data showed that MM
cells have higher intracellular ROS levels and increased
Trx1 and TrxR1 expression levels compared to the normal
PBMCs (Figure 1). We hypothesized that high Trx1 and
TrxR1 protein levels may provide protection against
increased oxidative stress and leads to MM cell survival
and growth. As discussed earlier, PX-12 is an irreversible
inhibitor of Trx1 and has been shown to inhibit tumor
growth and lead to ROS-induced apoptosis in a variety
of human cancers including acute myeloid leukemia [32],
colorectal cancer [39], and lung cancer [33, 40]. PX-12
has been tested in two independent clinical studies, one in
advanced gastrointestinal cancer and another in patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer [41, 42]. Although no
significant anti-tumor activity of PX-12 was observed in
both clinical studies, the Trx1 pathway was suggested as an
effective therapeutic target in cancer. Auranofin, a TrxR1
inhibitor, leads to oxidative stress-induced lethality and
apoptosis in cancers including chronic myeloid leukemia
[19], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [43], prostate
cancer [44], breast cancer [45], and acute leukemia [46].
Auranofin is currently in a phase II clinical trial for
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and adenosquamous cell
lung cancer patients. Because of the well documented
anti-tumor activity of PX-12 and auranofin, we used these
drugs, along with knockdown of Trx1 and TrxR1, as tools
to study the cytoprotective role of Trx1 and TrxR1 in MM.
In line with other studies reporting the cytoprotective role
of Trx1 and TrxR1 [17, 47], we showed that both druginduced inhibition and specific knockdown of Trx1 and
TrxR1 reduced MM cell proliferation, induced cell death,
and apoptosis (Figures 2 and 4). Inhibition of Trx1 and
TrxR1 using PX-12 and auranofin, respectively, had little
or no cytotoxic effect on non-cancerous PBMCs isolated
from healthy individuals (Figures 2 and 4). Hence, our
study suggests that both Trx1 and TrxR1 can be used as
effective therapeutic targets to treat MM.
The Trx system maintains the intracellular
redox homeostasis by scavenging ROS and regulating
various redox enzymes [9-11]. Inhibition of the Trx
system increases intracellular oxidative stress [48, 49].
We showed that Trx1 and TrxR1 inhibition increased
intracellular ROS levels and induced MM cell apoptosis
(Figures 3 and 5). Treatment of cells with antioxidants,
such as NAC or ascorbic acid, has reduced the amount of
ROS generated in response to Trx inhibition, and rescued
cells from undergoing apoptosis.
Overexpression of Trx1 and TrxR1 has been linked
to the aggressive phenotype of many cancer types,
including aggressive invasive mammary carcinomas and
advanced malignant melanoma [15]. Trx1 overexpression
has been shown to promote breast cancer cell invasion
by stimulating MMP-9 expression. Inhibition of Trx1
activity has been shown to decrease MMP-9 expression
via suppression of NF-кβ activity and expression of NFкβ subunits, p50 and p65, in breast cancer cells [50].

levels may be responsible for the resistance of MM cells
to NF-кβ-targeted therapies. In addition, we showed that
Trx1 inhibition resulted in decreased protein levels of NFкβ subunit p65 in MM cells. Therefore inhibiting Trx1 in
conjunction with the NF-кβ pathway may lead to a better
anti-myeloma therapy.
In recent years, many anti-myeloma drugs,
including bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone,
have been developed [57, 58]. Bortezomib, a proteasome
inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit proliferation and
induce apoptosis of human MM cell lines and primary
MM patient cells, without any significant cytotoxic
effect on non-cancerous PBMCs [59]. Upon prolonged
treatment with these drugs MM cells acquire resistance,
resulting in relapse [28, 60]. This study highlighted a
novel strategy to treat drug-resistant MM by inhibiting
Trx1. We showed that the Trx1 inhibiting drug PX-12
induced apoptosis in bortezomib-resistant MM cells.
These bortezomib-resistant U266 cells had higher Trx1
protein levels compared to the parent U266 cells (Figure
7B). In line with other studies indicating the role of Trx1
in chemoresistance [16, 17, 56], our results showed that
Trx1 inhibition sensitized bortezomib-resistant U266
cells to undergo apoptosis (Figure 7D). Our findings
complement a study that showed that inhibition of another
major antioxidant system, the glutathione system, strongly
enhances bortezomib-toxicity in MM [61]. Inhibition of
Trx1, might not only offer a novel approach to treat newly
diagnosed MM patients, but also those with drug-resistant
relapsed/refractory MM.
In conclusion, this research confirms that Trx1
inhibition results in ROS-induced apoptosis in MM cells,
sensitizes MM cells to the NF-кβ inhibitors, and also
induces apoptosis in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells.
Thus, Trx1 may be an effective therapeutic target to treat
newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM patients.
This research provides an important insight into the
cytoprotective role of Trx1 and TrxR1 in MM cell survival
and growth, which may lead to the development of new,
more effective approaches to treat MM, which is currently
incurable. This study recommends considering Trx1 and
TrxR1 as molecular targets for inhibition, which holds
promising anti-myeloma therapy.

Australia) containing 10% (V/V) fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Gibco), 200 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen,
VIC, Australia), and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/
ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The Trx1 antibody (5G8)
is a mouse monoclonal antibody generated against
recombinant human thioredoxin [62]. The monoclonal
anti-TrxR1 antibody was purchased from R&D systems
(MN, USA). The polyclonal anti-NF-кβ p65 antibody was
purchased from GeneTex (CA, USA) and anti-β-tubulin
antibody was purchased from Abcam. The Trx1 inhibitor
PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide) was
purchased from Cayman Chemicals (MI, USA). The NFκβ inhibitors BAY 11-7082 and curcumin were purchased
from Cayman Chemicals and Sigma. The TrxR1 validated
small interfering RNA (siRNA) and control siRNA were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (TX, USA).
The Trx1-anti sense plasmid was made by reversing the
orientation of the Trx insert in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) of
a pTrx-WT plasmid previously described [63].

Materials and Methods

Measurement of intracellular ROS generation

Cells and reagents

A dicholorofluorescein (DCF) assay was used to
determine cellular ROS generation in MM cells and
control PBMCs as described previously [64]. Briefly,
either 1 X 106 or 1 X 105 of treated or untreated cells were
washed with PBS and incubated with 10 µM H2DCFDA
(Molecular probes, CA, USA), a redox sensitive cell
permeable dye, for 15 minutes. Cells were then transferred
to black-walled clear-bottom 96-wells plate in triplicate
and assessed for H2DCFDA oxidation using a SpectraMax

Database
Gene expression data was obtained from the gene
expression profile arrays in patient myeloma cells at
different stages of the disease and healthy cells deposited
in the gene expression omnibus database GSE6477.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [62]. Whole cell extracts were prepared
using 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet-40 cell lysis buffer. Nuclear
and cytosolic fractions were prepared using Nuclear
Protein Extraction Kit (Cayman Chemicals) according
to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Protein samples were
solubilized with 5% SDS (w/v) sample buffer and
electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
and were probed with various specific antibodies (Trx1,
TrxR1, p65, β-tubulin) and the appropriate horseradish
peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies.

Human multiple myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226,
U266) were obtained from Dr. Slavica Vuckovic (QIMR
Berghofer Medical Research Institute). Human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
the whole blood of healthy volunteers and were collected
under the ethical approval BPS/08/14/HREC. The cells

low drug concentration for 1 week followed by 1 week in
a drug-free medium for stabilization. Cells were exposed
to increasing concentrations of bortezomib for 1 week
followed by 1 week in a drug-free medium before the next
bortezomib exposure for 12 weeks, and subsequently cells
became resistant to bortezomib. The resistant cells were
expanded in a drug-free medium. Cells were tested for
drug resistance before any further studies.

Cell proliferation assay
RPMI8226, U266, and PBMCs (0.5 X 106 cells
per well of 24-wells plate) were treated with appropriate
inhibitors for 24 hours. After which, cell proliferation was
determined using MTT solution (Sigma, NSW, Australia).

Methylcellulose clonogenic assay
The colony formation assay in methylcellulose
(R&D systems) was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, treated and untreated
MM cells were plated at the density of 1000 cells/ml in
1.1ml volume in 35 mm petri dishes. Each plate contained
RPMI-1640 media consisting of 1.4% methylcellulose,
25% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin, and 1% (w/v) BSA. Plates were incubated
at 37oC, 5% CO2 for 8-10 days. To observe colonies,
cells were stained with 0.5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma), 500 µl/
plate [66]. After incubating the plates for 1 hour at 37oC,
colonies containing more than 30 cells were counted using
an inverted light microscope. Colonies were photographed
using a Tucsen ix30 camera and TSview software (Tucsen,
China).

Cell viability measurement
Cell viability was measured by the Trypan blue
exclusion method. Treated and untreated cells were stained
with Trypan blue and viable cells were counted using an
inverted light microscope.

Caspase-3 activity assay
Caspase-3 activity within the treated and untreated
MM cell lines and PBMCs was determined as described
previously following the cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AMC
(Enzo Life Sciences, NY, USA), a caspase-3 substrate
[65]. Briefly, treated or untreated cells (0.5 X 106 cells)
were pelleted, washed with PBS, re-suspended in 10-15
µl of PBS, and transferred to black-walled 96-wells plate.
90 µl of caspase assay buffer (5 mM dithiothreitol, 100
mM HEPES, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% NP-40 at pH 7.25)
containing 50 μM Ac-DEVD-AMC was added to the
samples and the amount of AMC cleaved by caspase-3
was measured at 37°C by measuring the fluorescence at
excitation wavelength of 370 nm and emission of 445 nm
using SpectraMax plate reader.

Statistical analysis
All values are presented as mean ± SEM. Data
was analyzed using the software GraphPad Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Statistical significance
was determined by One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
post-test and Two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s posttest. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
