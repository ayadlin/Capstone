Abstract

Author Manuscript

CIB1 is a 22-kDa regulatory protein previously implicated in cell survival and proliferation.
However, the mechanism by which CIB1 regulates these processes is poorly defined. Here we
report that CIB1 depletion in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells
promotes non-apoptotic, caspase-independent cell death that is not initiated by increased outer
mitochondrial membrane permeability or translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nucleus.
Instead, cell death requires nuclear GAPDH accumulation. Furthermore, CIB1 depletion disrupts
two commonly dysregulated, oncogenic pathways– PI3K/AKT and Ras/MEK/ERK, resulting in a
synergistic mechanism of cell death, which was mimicked by simultaneous pharmacological
inhibition of both pathways, but not either pathway alone. In defining each pathway’s
contributions, we found that AKT inhibition alone maximally induced GAPDH nuclear
accumulation, whereas MEK/ERK inhibition alone had no effect on GAPDH localization.
Concurrent GAPDH nuclear accumulation and ERK inhibition were required however, to induce a
significant DNA damage response, which was critical to subsequent cell death. Collectively, our
results indicate that CIB1 is uniquely positioned to regulate PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling
and that simultaneous disruption of these pathways synergistically induces a nuclear GAPDHdependent cell death. The mechanistic insights into cell death induced by CIB1 interference
suggest novel molecular targets for cancer therapy.

oncogenic pathways are PI3K/AKT and Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK (1). Other intersecting
aberrantly activated pathways include PAK1, which contributes to MEK1, ERK (2) and
AKT activation (3), further promoting cell survival.
Concurrent activation and crosstalk between the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways may
contribute to drug resistance by converging on common downstream targets (1, 4). For
instance, both AKT and ERK phosphorylate and inactivate the proapoptotic protein BAD (5,
6) and the translational repressor 4E-BP1 (7). It is therefore becoming increasingly evident
that simultaneous targeting of multiple convergent signaling pathways is more effective in
promoting tumor cell death than targeting a single pathway (8).

Author Manuscript

Here, we report that CIB1 depletion disrupts tumor cell proliferation and promotes nonapoptotic cell death by interference with AKT and ERK signaling. CIB1 is a 22-kDa EFhand calcium-binding protein, homologous to calmodulin (9, 10). CIB1 interacts with and
regulates proteins involved in tumor cell survival and proliferation, including p21-activated
kinase 1 (PAK1) (11) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (12). CIB1−/− mice
show compromised tumor growth, most likely due to deficient tumor-induced angiogenesis
(13) and primary cells derived from CIB1−/− mice exhibit delayed proliferation (14, 15),
emphasizing the role of CIB1 in cell survival and proliferation. However, the precise
molecular mechanism by which CIB1 promotes these processes is not well defined.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, we find that the marked cell death occurring upon CIB1 depletion is
independent of caspase activation and mitochondrial permeabilization. Instead, cell death is
caused by a loss of AKT signaling, facilitating GAPDH nuclear accumulation, which
synergizes with loss of ERK signaling. While AKT and ERK inhibition alone minimally
induce cell death, concurrent pharmacologic inhibition recapitulates the extensive nonapoptotic cell death, induction of DNA damage and cell cycle disruption that we observed
with CIB1 depletion. Importantly, overexpression of GAPDH mutants that prevent posttranslational modification of GAPDH rescues CIB1-depleted cells from DNA damage and
cell death. In conclusion, these results identify previously unrecognized links between CIB1,
the ERK and AKT pathways, and GAPDH in non-apoptotic tumor cell death and provide
strategic opportunities to impair tumor cell survival.

RESULTS
CIB1 depletion induces cell death and inhibits cell proliferation

Author Manuscript

CIB1 regulates PAK1 activation and downstream signaling to ERK both in vitro and in vivo
(11, 15). Because ERK is frequently hyperactivated in many cancers, we hypothesized that
CIB1 may regulate tumor cell survival and proliferation. To test this, we silenced CIB1
expression in two distinct tumor cell models, the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (MYCN-nonamplified, wild-type p53 and Rb) and the triple-negative MDA-MB-468 (MDA-468) breast
epithelial cancer cell line (also mutant p53, PTEN and Rb negative). Endogenous CIB1
expression levels were consistently reduced by at least 80–90% in both tumor cell lines
(Figure 1a and supplemental S1a).

Microscopic analysis revealed that a marked proportion of CIB1-depleted cells became
detached or rounded within 48–72 h post-lentiviral transduction suggesting increased cell
death (Figure 1b, bottom panels). Trypan blue staining of adherent and floating cell
populations indicated a marked ~6-fold increase in cell death in both CIB1-depleted SK-NSH (Figure 1b) and MDA-MB-468 cells (supplemental figure S1c). Moreover, >95% of the
detached CIB1-depleted cells were nonviable as detected by trypan blue uptake.
Nucleosome formation was also significantly increased in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells
(Figure 1c), suggesting that CIB1 depletion may induce DNA fragmentation. Ectopic
reexpression of a CIB1 silent mutant (CIB1-sm) resistant to shRNA knockdown prevented
cell death induced by CIB1 shRNA in both SK-N-SH (Figure 1d) and MDA-468 cells
(supplemental figure S1d), demonstrating that CIB1 depletion specifically induces cell
death.

Author Manuscript

Cell counts of CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH and MDA-468 cells indicated a significant 1.9-and
1.6-fold decrease in proliferation rates, respectively (Figure 1e and supplemental figure
S1e), which was also confirmed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) ELISA analysis (Figure 1f).
These results indicate that CIB1 depletion disrupted cell proliferation in two separate tumor
cell types.
CIB1 depletion results in caspase-independent cell death

Author Manuscript

To determine the mechanism of cell death, we first investigated the status of caspase
activation. In the absence of the apoptotic agent staurosporine (STS), no evidence of
caspase-7 or -9 cleavage or cleavage of the caspase-3 and -6 substrates, poly-ADP ribose
polymerase (PARP) and lamin A/C, respectively, was observed in either control or CIB1depleted SK-N-SH cells (Figure 2a), demonstrating that key caspases were not activated
simply by the absence of endogenous CIB1. In contrast, STS induced a dose-dependent
increase in the activation of these caspases in both control and CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH
cells that was not further enhanced by CIB1 depletion (Figure 2a). Identical results were
obtained with increasing concentrations of another apoptotic agent, the topoisomerase II
inhibitor, etoposide (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that, while the
apoptotic pathway is intact in these cells, CIB1 depletion does not induce cell death by
triggering or enhancing caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.
CIB1 depletion does not affect mitochondrial function

Author Manuscript

DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and cell death can occur
independently of caspase activation (16). Therefore, mitochondrial membrane potential
(Δψm) was analyzed using the membrane permeable fluorescent cationic dye, JC-10, which
accumulates in non-compromised mitochondria and is released into the cytosol as monomers
upon mitochondrial disruption. Because no overall difference in JC-10 fluorescence was
observed between adherent CIB1-depleted and control shRNA cells (Figure 2b), these
results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction does not precede the onset of CIB1-depletioninduced cell death. As a positive control, the mitochondrial depolarization agent, carbonyl
cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), did decrease the fluorescent emission signals in
both control and CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 2b) and MDA-468 cells (supplementary

figure S2a), consistent with a collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased
mitochondrial permeabilization.
Caspase-independent cell death can also be initiated by translocation of proteins such as
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial intermembrane to the nucleus (17).
Here we found that AIF localized mainly to mitochondrial structures in both control and
CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells (Figure 2c), further confirming that CIB1 depletion does not
initiate cell death by affecting mitochondrial membrane integrity or release of apoptotic
proteins.

Author Manuscript

Because CIB1 depletion can enhance ASK1/JNK-mediated activation and apoptosis in
response to oxidative stress in 293T and HeLa cells (12), we examined JNK activation as a
mechanism of cell death. The JNK inhibitor SP00125, however, had no effect on CIB1depleted SK-N-SH or MDA-468 cell death (supplementary figures S2b and S2c,
respectively), suggesting that JNK signaling does not contribute significantly to cell death in
CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH and MDA-MB-468 cells.
In certain cellular contexts, the degradative process of autophagy can serve as an alternative
cell death mechanism. However, no difference in levels of the well-established autophagic
marker LC3-II was observed between control and CIB1-depleted cells (data not shown),
suggesting that autophagy was not induced.
CIB1-depletion induces GAPDH nuclear accumulation and GAPDH-dependent cell death

Author Manuscript

Because nuclear translocation and accumulation of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH
contributes to neuronal and non-neuronal cell death (18), we examined GAPDH localization
in CIB1-depleted cells. Subcellular analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions revealed a
significant accumulation of GAPDH in the nuclear fraction of both CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH
cells (Figure 3a) and MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S3a), indicating that CIB1
depletion induces GAPDH nuclear accumulation.

Author Manuscript

We next asked if increased nuclear accumulation of GAPDH per se contributes to the cell
death observed in CIB1-depleted cells. The monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor,
R(−)-Deprenyl (deprenyl) binds directly to GAPDH, inhibits its nuclear translocation, and
has been used by others to link GAPDH nuclear translocation to cell death (19). Deprenyl
treatment markedly reduced GAPDH nuclear accumulation in both CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH
(Figure 3b) and MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S3b). Immunocytochemical staining
also confirmed the predominantly cytoplasmic GAPDH localization in control cells and
increased nuclear GAPDH localization in CIB1-depleted cells that was blocked by deprenyl
(Figure 3c).
If nuclear GAPDH accumulation is the primary cause of death in CIB1-depleted cells,
deprenyl treatment, by preventing nuclear GAPDH accumulation, should prevent cell death.
Deprenyl treatment did reduce cell death in both CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 3d) and
MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S3b), providing strong evidence that GAPDH nuclear
accumulation promotes cell death.

S-nitrosylation of cysteine 150 (Cys150) within the GAPDH active site is known to facilitate
GAPDH nuclear translocation and subsequent cell death (20). Since GAPDH S-nitrosylation
and nuclear translocation can be blocked by deprenyl or a GAPDH mutant resistant to Snitrosylation at Cys150 (GAPDH-C150S) (20, 21), we predicted that GAPDH-C150S should
prevent CIB1-depletion-induced cell death. Indeed, overexpression of GAPDH-C150S but
not WT-GAPDH in both CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 3e) and MDA-468 cells
(supplementary figure S3c) blocked CIB1-depletion induced cell death and GAPDH nuclear
accumulation. This result implies a role for GAPDH S-nitrosylation and additionally
supports a role for GAPDH nuclear accumulation in cell death.

Author Manuscript

Under stress conditions, nuclear GAPDH also becomes acetylated at lysine 160 (K160) by
the acetyltransferase p300/CBP (22). Acetylated GAPDH in turn, binds to p300/CBP to
stimulate p300/CBP acetylation of nuclear proteins, triggering their degradation (20, 22).
The GAPDH acetylation-resistant mutant, GAPDH-K160R, functions in a dominantnegative manner by blocking endogenous GAPDH acetylation and cell death (22). To test
whether GAPDH acetylation is involved in the cell death mechanism in CIB1-depleted cells,
GAPDH-K160R was overexpressed and cell viability assessed as above. Notably, a
significant decrease in cell death was observed in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 3e) and
MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S3c) that expressed this mutant, strongly implicating
a role for GAPDH acetylation in mediating cell death in CIB1-depleted cells. Consistent
with previous reports that the K160R mutation does not affect GAPDH nuclear translocation
(22), we still observed significant nuclear GAPDH in CIB1-depleted cells (Figures 3e and
S3c).

S-nitrosylation of Cys150 reversibly inactivates GAPDH, but under extreme cellular stress,
Cys150 can undergo further oxidative modification that results in irreversible inactivation of
its catalytic activity (23). Since S-nitrosylation of GAPDH plays a role in the observed cell
death, we asked whether GAPDH activity was globally suppressed by CIB1 depletion. No
difference in global GAPDH activity, however, was observed in either CIB1-depleted SKN-SH or MDA-468 cells (supplementary figures S4a and S4b, respectively) or in the same
cells overexpressing GAPDH-C150S (supplementary figures S4a and S4b). As a positive
control, treatment of SK-N-SH cells with a GAPDH inhibitor, iodoacetate (IOA), dosedependently inhibited GAPDH activity (supplementary figure S4c), which correlated with
increased cell death 24 h-post treatment (supplementary figure S4d). This effect is consistent
with shRNA depletion of GAPDH, which also induced a significant decrease in overall
GAPDH activity (supplemental figure S4b) and increased cell death in both cell lines (data
not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that CIB1 depletion induces GAPDH Snitrosylation but has minimal effect on global GAPDH activity. Therefore, cell death in
CIB1-depleted cells is unlikely due to increased metabolic stress.
To more firmly confirm nuclear GAPDH accumulation and rule out caspase activation as a
mediator of cell death, CIB1-depleted cells were treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor
zVAD-FMK. Unlike deprenyl, zVAD-FMK did not prevent cell death induced by CIB1depletion in either SK-N-SH (Figure 4b, upper graph) or MDA-468 cells (supplementary
figure S3b, upper graph) and had no effect on GAPDH nuclear accumulation in either CIB1depleted cell type (Figure 4b and supplementary figure S3b, bottom panels). These results

indicate that nuclear GAPDH accumulation, but not caspase activation, promotes cell death
in CIB1-depleted cells.
CIB1 depletion disrupts ERK1/2 and AKT signaling

Author Manuscript

Since we previously found that endothelial cells lacking CIB1 exhibited decreased cell
proliferation and ERK activation (15), we asked whether ERK signaling was compromised
in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH and MDA-468 cells. Consistent with our previous findings,
reduced ERK activation was observed in both CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 4a) and
MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S5c). CIB1 can activate PAK1 both in vitro and in
vivo (11, 15) and PAK1 is a well-established activator of the MEK/ERK pathway. Like ERK
activation, PAK1 activation (as determined by PAKS199/204 phosphorylation) was markedly
reduced in both CIB1-depleted tumor cell lines (Figure 4a and supplementary figure S5c).
Because PAK1 was also recently reported to regulate AKT (3), we assessed the status of
AKT activation in CIB1-depleted cells. A marked reduction of AKT activity was observed
in both cell types, as detected by decreased AKT308 and AKT473 phosphorylation (Figure 4a
and supplementary figure S5c). These results indicate that CIB1 expression regulates both
AKT and ERK activation in multiple tumor cell types.

Author Manuscript

A common downstream target of PAK1, ERK, and AKT is the proapoptotic protein BAD,
which when phosphorylated, promotes cell survival (24). Decreased BADS136
phosphorylation was also observed in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 4a) and MDA-468
cells (supplementary figure S5c), consistent with decreased PAK1 and/or AKT activation in
both cell types. While AKT phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3α/β can contribute to
cell survival and cell cycle regulation (25), no difference in phosphorylation levels of either
GSK3 isoform (data not shown) was observed upon CIB1 depletion in either tumor cell line
(Figure 4a, supplementary figure S5c and data not shown).
We then assessed whether PAK1, AKT, ERK, or BAD activation in CIB1-depleted cells
occurred upstream or downstream of nuclear GAPDH translocation to the nucleus, by
blocking nuclear accumulation with deprenyl. Interestingly, deprenyl had no effect on the
activation status of these kinases (Figure 4a and supplementary figure S5c). Deprenyl
treatment also had no effect on overall GAPDH expression levels in either SK-N-SH (Figure
4c) or MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S5b). Similar to deprenyl treatment,
overexpression of GAPDH-C150S and -K160R mutants had no effect on AKT and ERK
activation in either SK-N-SH (Figure 4d) or MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S6a).
Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of blocking GAPDH nuclear
accumulation and signaling occur downstream of AKT, PAK1 and ERK.

Author Manuscript

Activation of the GAPDH/p300/CBP signaling cascade induces p53-upregulated mediator of
apoptosis (PUMA), and PUMA upregulation can be blocked by GAPDH-K160R (22). Since
we found that GAPDH acetylation is important in mediating cell death in CIB1-depleted
cells, we asked if a p300/CBP/PUMA signaling cascade was activated as a result of CIB1
depletion. No changes in PUMA expression, however, were found in either CIB1-depleted
SK-N-SH (Figure 4d) or MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S5a). We also observed no
change in the expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, MCL-1, which is
degraded in response to apoptotic stimuli (26, 27) in either CIB1-depleted cell line (Figure

4d and supplementary figure S5a). Collectively, these results are consistent with a nonapoptotic mechanism of cell death in CIB1-depleted cells.
AKT inhibition induces nuclear GAPDH accumulation

Author Manuscript

Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling can block the nuclear export of GAPDH (28), suggesting
that PI3K/AKT negatively regulates nuclear GAPDH localization. We therefore asked if
inhibition of AKT would mimic CIB1 depletion and induce GAPDH nuclear accumulation.
SK-N-SH cells treated with increasing concentrations of AKT inhibitor VIII (AKTi),
exhibited increased nuclear GAPDH accumulation (Figure 5a) that correlated with
decreasing levels of AKT phosphorylation. However, total AKT expression or activation of
other MAP kinases such as p38 (data not shown) or ERK were unaffected (Figure 5b).
Importantly, AKTi induced a modest, dose-dependent increase in cell death that correlated
with decreased AKT phosphorylation (Figure 5b). Like CIB1 depletion, AKT inhibition
failed to induce caspase activation, as detected by the absence of PARP cleavage products or
changes in BCL-2 expression (Figure 5b). Immunocytochemical anaylsis of SK-N-SH cells
treated with AKTi also showed a significant increase in nuclear GAPDH staining (Figure
5c), further supporting our finding that CIB1 depletion induces GAPDH nuclear
accumulation due to loss of AKT activity.
Concurrent inhibition of AKT and ERK mimic cell death induced by CIB1 depletion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

While AKT inhibition alone induced a modest increase in SK-N-SH cell death and
significant GAPDH nuclear accumulation, it did not induce the same extent of cell death
observed in CIB1-depleted cells. This suggests the contribution of additional signaling
pathways. Since ERK activation was also reduced in CIB1-depleted cells (Figure 4a and
supplementary figure S4e), we asked whether the combined pharmacological inhibition of
AKT and ERK would more closely mimic cell death induced by CIB1 depletion. Indeed,
treatment of cells with both AKTi and the MEK inhibitor U0126 induced a significant ~12fold increase in cell death (Figure 6a) whereas MEK/ERK inhibition alone had a minimal
effect (Figure 6a). Western blot analysis confirmed that AKTi and U0126 effectively
inhibited AKT and ERK phosphorylation, respectively (Figure 6b). Inhibition of both AKT
and ERK also failed to induce caspase activation as evidenced by the lack of PARP and
caspase-9 cleavage products (Figure 6b), indicating a caspase-independent mechanism of
death in these cell types. Similar to our findings with CIB1-depleted cells, deprenyl
treatment significantly reduced cell death induced by the combined inhibition of ERK and
AKT (Figure 6a) further supporting a role for nuclear GAPDH in promoting cell death upon
AKT and ERK inhibition. Interestingly, inhibition of both pathways did not further increase
nuclear GAPDH accumulation relative to inhibition of either enzyme alone (Figure 6a,
lower panels). Moreover, deprenyl blocked GAPDH nuclear accumulation in cells incubated
with AKTi and U0126 (Figure 6a, lower panels). To further implicate AKT activity in
regulating GAPDH translocation, we expressed a constitutively active AKT mutant (myrAKT) in control and CIB1-depleted cells. Restoration of AKT activity in CIB1-depleted
cells prevented cell death in both SK-N-SH (Figure 6c) and MDA-468 cells (supplementary
figure S6b), and importantly, reduced GAPDH nuclear accumulation in both cell lines
(Figure 6c and supplementary figure S6b, bottom panels). These results imply that AKT
inhibition is sufficient to induce nuclear GAPDH accumulation, but that concurrent

inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway is necessary to mimic CIB1 depletion-induced,
GAPDH-dependent tumor cell death.
CIB1 depletion affects cell cycle progression and induces DNA damage

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To better understand the cell proliferation defect in CIB1-depleted cells, flow cytometry was
used to assess cell cycle profiles of asynchronously growing cells. CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH
cells showed a moderate accumulation of cells in the G1 phase relative to control cells (53%
vs. 41%, respectively) (Figure 7a), whereas CIB1-depleted MDA-468 cells showed a more
significant G1 accumulation (supplementary figure S7a). This increased G1 accumulation
was also associated with a reduced percentage of cells in S and G2/M in both cell types
(Figure 7a and supplementary figure S7a), suggesting that CIB1 depletion induces G1 cell
cycle arrest. Since cell cycle arrest can be triggered by DNA damage, it was noteworthy that
both CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 7a) and MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S7a)
showed a ~ 2-fold increase of cells in the sub-G1 fraction (<2N DNA ploidy) that is often
associated with DNA fragmentation. We also assessed markers commonly associated with
induction of DNA damage. A significant increase in phosphorylation of both the histone
variant H2AX at Ser139 (γH2AX), a sensitive marker of early DNA damage (29) and
checkpoint kinase CHK1 (30) was observed in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH and MDA-468 cells
(Figure 7b and supplementary figure S7b). This DNA damage response appears to precede
cell death since these markers were observed in the adherent, viable CIB1-depleted cell
population (Figure 7b), suggesting that DNA damage may be a cause of cell death rather
than a secondary consequence. This effect is specific for CIB1 depletion since ectopic reexpression of CIB1 in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH and MDA-468 cells blocked induction of
γH2Ax (Figure 7c and supplementary figure S7c, respectively). While deprenyl did not
significantly rescue cell proliferation in either CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 7c, upper
panel) or MDA-468 cells (data not shown), it did reduce the sub-G1 population (Figure 7a
and supplementary figure S7a) and γH2AX induction (Figure 7b and supplementary figure
S7b), suggesting a role for abnormal nuclear GAPDH accumulation in DNA damage. Since
blocking GAPDH nuclear accumulation with deprenyl correlated with decreased H2AX
phosphorylation, we predicted that expression of either GAPDH-C150S or GAPDH-K150R
would reduce the extent of DNA damage in CIB1-depleted cells. As expected,
overexpression of either GAPDH mutant effectively blocked induction of H2AX
phosphorylation in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 7d) and MDA-468 cells
(supplementary figure S7d), suggesting that both GAPDH nuclear accumulation and
acetylation are required to induce DNA damage.
CIB1 depletion disrupts key cell cycle signaling pathways

Author Manuscript

The accumulation of CIB1-depleted cells in G1 suggested that regulatory proteins associated
with G1 could be disrupted or dysregulated. An important regulatory step required for G1/S
transition is phosphorylation of Thr160 within the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)
activation loop. A marked reduction in CDK2 phosphorylation was observed in both CIB1depleted tumor cell lines (Figures 7e and supplementary figure S7e), suggesting a potential
mechanism of G1 arrest. Active cyclin E/A CDK2 complexes also regulate the G1/S
transition by phosphorylation and activation of retinoblastoma (Rb) (31). Consistent with a
loss of CDK2 activation, CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells also showed a marked reduction in

RbS780 phosphorylation (Figure 7e). Rb phosphorylation was not detected in MDA-468
cells, consistent with the absence of Rb in this cell type (data not shown). Expression levels
of cyclin D1, which along with other cyclins, regulates CDK activity, were similar in either
CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH (Figure 7e) or MDA-468 cells (supplementary figure S7e). Cyclin
E, however, was downregulated in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells (Figure 7e) and
upregulated in CIB1-depleted MDA-468 cells (supplementary Figure S7e), suggesting cell
type specific effects of CIB1 depletion on G1 regulation. Taken together, these results
suggest that loss of CIB1 disrupts CDK2 and Rb phosphorylation, and cyclin E expression
—key cell cycle regulatory proteins necessary for G1/S transition.

Author Manuscript

Activation of the CDK1/cyclin B1 complex is an important regulatory step in the G2/M
transition. Moreover, cyclin B1 depletion can increase cell death and decrease tumor cell
proliferation (32). CIB1-depleted tumor cell lines exhibited decreases in both cyclin B1
expression and inhibitory CDK1Y15 phosphorylation (Figure 7e and supplementary figure
S7e), indicating abnormally activated CDK1. Interestingly, deprenyl rescued CDK1
phosphorylation in both CIB1-depleted cell types (Figure 7c and supplementary figure S7e),
but had no effect on G1/S-related cyclins or CDK2. Deprenyl however, did not rescue cell
proliferation in either CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH or MDA-468 (Figure 7e and supplemental
figure S7e), suggesting that CIB1 depletion induces G1/S disruption independent of nuclear
GAPDH accumulation.
Concurrent inhibition of ERK and AKT mimics the effects of CIB1 depletion on
proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

If disrupted cell proliferation in CIB1-depleted cells occurs through inhibition of AKT and
ERK, pharmacological inhibition of these kinases should similarly disrupt proliferation and
cell cycle regulatory proteins. Indeed, AKTi alone decreased cell proliferation 1.5-fold;
concurrent ERK inhibition with U0126 did not cause a further reduction (Figure 7f, upper
graph). Concurrent treatment with AKTi and U0126 markedly decreased Rb, CDK2 and
CDK1 phosphorylation as well as cyclin B1 expression but had no effect on cyclin D1 levels
(Figure 7f). These results mimic the activation and expression profile of these proteins in
CIB1-depleted cells. In addition, AKT inhibition alone maximally inhibited CDK2
phosphorylation, indicating that ERK inhibition is not necessary for this effect. While
U0126 effectively inhibited MEK/ERK activation, it had no effect on expression or
activation of several cell cycle regulatory proteins (Figure 7f), consistent with the inability
of U0126 alone to significantly inhibit cell survival and proliferation. Importantly,
concurrent AKT and ERK inhibition did induce phosphorylation of the DNA damage
marker γH2AX (Figure 7f). Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of both pathways
synergizes to recapitulate the effects of CIB1 depletion on DNA damage, cell cycle
disruption and cell death.

DISCUSSION
Here we report that CIB1 is necessary for tumor cell survival and proliferation. Specifically,
CIB1 knockdown significantly increases non-apoptotic tumor cell death and decreases cell
proliferation by separate but related mechanisms. CIB1 depletion results in AKT inhibition,

itself is necessary, but concurrent ERK inhibition is also required to induce the extent of cell
death observed in CIB1-depleted cells. CIB1 depletion also induces GAPDH-dependent
DNA damage and cell death. This DNA damage response requires GAPDH nuclear
accumulation and GAPDH acetylation. These results highlight the novel link between loss
of CIB1 expression, dysregulation of AKT and ERK signaling, GAPDH nuclear
accumulation, and non-apoptotic cell death.

CIB1 depletion in two distinct cancer cell lines significantly decreased cell viability
independent of caspase activation or loss of mitochondrial function. Rather, we observed a
marked increase in nuclear GAPDH accumulation. Increasing evidence indicates that
nuclear accumulation or translocation of GAPDH can induce cell death in both neuronal and
non-neuronal cells (18, 22). GAPDH nuclear accumulation in and of itself, however, does
not establish nuclear GAPDH as a causative factor in promoting cell death. The MAO-B
inhibitor, deprenyl, specifically interacts with and inhibits GAPDH nuclear accumulation,
thereby preventing nuclear GAPDH-induced cell death (20, 33). Since deprenyl significantly
reduced nuclear GAPDH accumulation and cell death in CIB-depleted cells, this finding
provides a strong link between these events. Deprenyl also had no effect on GAPDH
activity, survival or proliferation of control cells indicating that the deprenyl concentration
used in our study is unlikely to have adverse effects on normal cellular glycolysis.

Posttranslational modification of GAPDH occurs as a result of oxidative stress and is
thought to govern GAPDH nuclear localization (23). For example, S-nitrosylation of Cys150
(Cys152 in human GAPDH) within the GAPDH active site facilitates its association with the
E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah-1 resulting in GAPDH nuclear translocation via the Siah-1 nuclear
localization sequence. Deprenyl inhibits GAPDH S-nitrosylation and subsequent GAPDH
binding to Siah-1, thereby preventing GAPDH translocation to the nucleus (20). Cell death
and GAPDH translocation to the nucleus is also blocked by mutation of Cys150 in GAPDH
(20, 34). Since we found that both deprenyl and GAPDH-C150S block GAPDH nuclear
accumulation and cell death, our results suggest that GAPDH undergoes S-nitrosylation in
CIB1-depleted cells. While S-nitrosylation at this catalytic site inhibits GAPDH activity in
vitro (35, 36), we found no decline in global GAPDH activity in CIB1-depleted cells,
suggesting that the cell death observed in CIB1-depleted cells is unlikely due to metabolic
stress. Aggregation of GAPDH, in the absence of GAPDH nuclear accumulation is also
reported to induce cell death under increased cellular stress conditions (34). Under low to
moderate stress conditions however, the authors did find that cell death is accompanied by
GAPDH nuclear translocation (34). Western blot analysis did not reveal the presence of
GAPDH aggregates in CIB1-depleted cells (data not shown), suggesting that CIB1 depletion
likely induces a low to moderate oxidative stress signaling cascade. Because we also
observed a significant proportion of GAPDH remaining in the cytoplasmic compartment, it
may be likely that this low to moderate oxidative stress modifies a subpopulation of
GAPDH in CIB1-depleted cells. In agreement, Hara, et al., report that a small population of
GAPDH is S-nitrosylated and translocated to the nucleus under their experimental
conditions and is sufficient to induce cell death (20). The authors also find that cell death
triggered by nuclear GAPDH-Siah1 is largely independent of glycolytic impairment (20).

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how nuclear GAPDH promotes cell
death. One mechanism involves Siah-1-dependent degradation of nuclear proteins via the
nuclear GAPDH/Siah-1 complex (20). Nuclear GAPDH can also bind and stimulate
acetyltransferase p300/CBP, leading to the activation of p53 and induction of cell death (22).
These events are known to be blocked by expression of a GAPDH mutant resistant to
acetylation at lysine 160 (GAPDH-K160R) (22). Consistent with these findings, we
observed that expression of GAPDH-K160R blocks cell death, indicating that GAPDH
acetylation is required to induce cell death in CIB1-depleted cells. However, since cell death
occurs in MDA-468 cells that express mutant p53, CIB1 depletion appears to induce cell
death independent of p53 status per se. Because tumors bearing mutant p53 are more
resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and strongly correlate with poor patient prognosis (37),
our results indicate that CIB1 inhibition could provide an effective therapeutic approach for
treating these tumors.

Tumor cells commonly exhibit hyperactivated PI3K/AKT and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling
pathways. Since CIB1 depletion markedly reduced both ERK and AKT activation, it is
important to consider the contribution of each pathway in GAPDH-dependent cell death.
Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling is known to block nuclear export of GAPDH upon growth
factor stimulation (28, 38), indicating a link between PI3K/AKT survival signaling and
GAPDH localization. In agreement, we find that restoration of AKT activity in CIB1depleted cells blocks GAPDH nuclear accumulation and cell death, demonstrating the
importance of AKT in regulating GAPDH localization. Furthermore, our results showed that
AKT but not ERK inhibition markedly and maximally increased nuclear GAPDH
localization, which correlated with a moderate increase in cell death. Inhibition of both
pathways, however, induced similar levels of cell death to that observed in CIB1-depleted
cells. These results show that GAPDH nuclear accumulation is necessary, but not sufficient
to induce the extent of cell death observed in CIB1-depleted cells. Other reports also
indicate that in certain instances, nuclear GAPDH accumulation alone is not sufficient to
induce cell death (39). Notably, forced nuclear targeting of GAPDH fused to a nuclear
localization sequence (GAPDH-NLS) fails to induce cell death in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
(40) and HEK293 cells (20). Yet, depletion of GAPDH or blocking GAPDH nuclear
accumulation is protective against genotoxic or stress-induced stimuli (41, 42), indicating
that GAPDH is necessary for cell death under these stress conditions.

We previously demonstrated that CIB1 directly activates PAK1, which affects downstream
signaling to ERK (11, 15). CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH and MDA-MB-468 cells exhibit
significantly reduced PAK1 activation that correlated with a reduction in ERK activity.
Recently, PAK1 was found to directly regulate AKT in colorectal cancer (3) and Erb-B2
positive breast cancer cells (43), thereby possibly explaining how CIB1 regulates both ERK
and AKT.
Another consequence of CIB1 depletion is increased DNA damage. CIB1-depleted adherent
and floating cell populations showed a moderate increase in the sub-G1 content that is
typically associated with cell shrinkage, large scale DNA fragmentation, and condensed
nuclei. Adherent, viable CIB1-depleted cells however, showed no noticeable increase in
these apoptotic nuclear characteristics. Instead, this adherent cell population exhibited a

marked increase in γH2AX and CHK1 activation, suggesting more moderate DNA damage
that precedes cell detachment and cell death. Concurrent inhibition of AKT and ERK
mimicked CIB1 depletion by inducing γH2AX, indicating that loss of these signaling
pathways is sufficient to induce DNA damage. GAPDH depletion is known to protect
against DNA damage and subsequent γH2AX formation induced by the cytotoxic agent
cytosine arabinoside (AraC) (41), thus implicating a role for nuclear GAPDH in the DNA
damage response. In agreement, we found that inhibition of GAPDH nuclear accumulation
in CIB1-depleted cells markedly reduced the induction of γH2AX and appearance of the
sub-G1 population, further suggesting a link between GAPDH nuclear accumulation, DNA
damage and subsequent cell death. This response also requires GAPDH acetylation since
expression of an acetylation mutant blocked CIB1-depletion-induced cell death.
Interestingly, GAPDH directly interacts with DNA as well as with several nuclear
components involved in DNA repair/damage and transcription such as the NAD+-dependent
deacetylase SIRT1 (21) and AP endonuclease1 (APE1) (44). Exactly how nuclear GAPDH
expression induces DNA damage in CIB1-depleted cells or other scenarios where this
occurs (41, 45) is unknown and warrants future investigation.

Author Manuscript

ERK signaling can positively regulate DNA repair mechanisms to attenuate DNA damage
(46, 47). This role of ERK may account for the absence of DNA damage and modest cell
death in cells where only AKT is inhibited, despite a marked increase in nuclear GAPDH,
and may explain why concurrent inhibition of ERK was required to induce DNA damage
and significant cell death. DNA damage also normally induces activation of upstream
kinases WEE/MYT1 that phosphorylate and inactivate CDK1 to prevent entry into mitosis
thereby allowing sufficient time for DNA repair. Aberrant or unchecked CDK1 activation in
the face of DNA damage results in premature entry into mitosis and has been associated
with increased cell death (48). An interesting finding from our study is the marked decrease
in CDK1 phosphorylation (i.e., increased CDK1 activation) that was blocked by preventing
GAPDH nuclear accumulation in CIB1-depleted cells treated with deprenyl. These results
therefore suggest that nuclear GAPDH also prevents sufficient G2/M delay by disrupting
CDK1 phosphorylation and inactivation. How nuclear GAPDH prevents this delay is
currently unknown. One possibility may be through the interaction of nuclear GAPDH with
SET, a negative regulator of CDK1/cyclin B1 activity, thereby resulting in indirect CDK1
activation (49).

Here we find increased accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle suggesting
that CIB1 depletion also results in G1 arrest. Two important regulatory steps for G1/S
transition are CDK2 and retinoblastoma (Rb) activation by active cyclin E/A-CDK2
complexes (31). While the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways have both been implicated
in regulating CDK2 (50), we found that AKT but not ERK inhibition was sufficient to
inhibit CDK2 activation and block cell proliferation. Our results therefore suggest that
decreased AKT activation in CIB1-depleted cells likely contributes to decreased CDK2
activation and subsequent G1 arrest. In agreement, inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling is also
known to promote G1 arrest in several cancer cell lines (51, 52). In addition, our finding that
blocking GAPDH nuclear accumulation with either deprenyl or GAPDH-C150S did not

restore cell proliferation, suggests that cell cycle arrest occurs independently of GAPDH
nuclear accumulation.
In summary, we have identified CIB1 as a novel upstream regulator of two major oncogenic
pathways that promote cell survival and proliferation. Our results suggest a model whereby
CIB1, via AKT and ERK signaling prevents abnormal nuclear GAPDH accumulation, DNA
damage and cell death (supplementary figure S8). Additional studies will be needed to
define the precise mechanisms by which nuclear GAPDH induces DNA damage and cell
death in CIB1-depleted cells. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that CIB1 may represent a
unique molecular target for inducing selective tumor cell death via regulation of these
pathways.

SEM, n=5. Representative phase contrast images show significant loss of adherent CIB1depleted cells (bottom panels). (c) Analysis of control and CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells by
immunochemical ELISA assays that detect histone-complexed DNA fragments as a marker
of cell death (*p<0.05). (d) Ectopic expression of a shRNA-resistant CIB1 silent mutant
(CIB1-sm) in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells prevents cell death. Cell death was quantified
as in (a), n=4. (e) Cell proliferation over 72 h, quantifed as total cell numbers at the
indicated times post-transduction, n=2. (f) CIB1 depleted SK-N-SH cells show decreased
cell proliferation as determined by BrdU proliferation assays (*p<0.05). Representative
phase contrast images show significant loss of cell number from wells containing CIB1depleted cells (bottom panels).

Figure 2. Effect of CIB1 depletion on caspase activation and mitochondrial function

Author Manuscript

(a) Control and CIB1 depleted SK-N-SH cells were incubated in the absence (0) and
presence of increasing concentrations (0.05–1.0 mM) of staurosporine (STS); whole cell
lysates were immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies, n=3. (b) CIB1-depletion does
not affect mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The mitochondrial dye JC-10 was used
to quantify Δψm in adherent control and CIB1-depleted cells. In non-compromised
mitochondria, JC-10 accumulates as J-aggregates which fluoresce at 590 nm (data expressed
in relative fluorescence units). As positive control, cells were treated with 4 μM of the
mitochondrial depolarizing agent carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP),
resulting in the release of JC-10 monomers, as indicated by decreased fluorescence at 590
nm. Data represent means +/− SEM, n=2. (c) Control and CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells
were immunostained with an anti-AIF antibody (green fluorescence) and nuclei were
visualized by counterstaining with DAPI (blue fluorescence). Images are representative of at
least 3 separate experiments. Scale bar = 20 μm

Figure 3. Cell death induced by CIB1 depletion requires GAPDH nuclear accumulation and
GAPDH S-nitrosylation and acetylation

Author Manuscript

(a) Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions shows increased nuclear
GAPDH in CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH cells. αTubulin and lamin A/C antibodies were used to
confirm cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. (b) Deprenyl blocks nuclear
accumulation of GAPDH. Control (ctrl) and CIB1-depleted cells were treated with or
without 25 nM deprenyl (DEP) and analyzed as in (a), n=4. (c) Immunohistochemical
analysis of GAPDH localization. Control and CIB1-depleted cells were treated with and
without deprenyl as in (b) and immunostained with anti-GAPDH (green) and nuclei were
visualized with DAPI (blue). Bar = 20 μm. (d) Deprenyl protects CIB1-depleted cells from
cell death. Cells were treated with or without DEP as in (b). Cell death was determined as in
Figure 1b. Data represent means ± SEM, n=8. (e) Cell death in control and CIB1-depleted
cells expressing empty vector, HA-GAPDH-WT, -C150S or -K160R was quantified as in
Figure 1b. Data represent means +/− SEM, n=4 (t-test; * p<0.05 versus CIB1 shRNA).
Effect of GAPDH-WT, -C150, or -K160R expression on GAPDH nuclear accumulation.
Nuclear lysates were immunoblotted with anti-GAPDH or -histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1)
antibodies, lower panels.

Figure 4. Effect of CIB1 depletion on AKT, ERK and PAK1 signaling pathways in the absence
and presence of deprenyl or zVAD-FMK

(a) Immunoblots of whole cell lysates prepared from control and CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH
cells, n ≥ 3. (b) Deprenyl (DEP), but not caspase inhibition with zVAD-FMK (zVAD)
blocks nuclear GAPDH accumulation and cell death. (c) GAPDH expression is unchanged
in the absence and presence of either DEP or zVAD. (d) Whole cell lysates from SK-N-SH
cells expressing emtpy vector, HA-GAPDH-WT, -CI50S or -K160R were immunoblotted
with the indicated antibodies.

Figure 6. Effects of combined AKT and ERK inhibition on SK-N-SH cell death and GAPDH
nuclear accumulation

Author Manuscript

Untransduced SK-N-SH cells were treated in the absence and presence of either 10 μM
U0126 (MEK inhibitor) and/or 20 μM AKTi. Cells exposed to both inhibitors were also
treated with 25 nM deprenyl. (a) Concurrent inhibition of AKT and ERK significantly
increases cell death but not GAPDH nuclear accumulation. Cell death was quantified as in
Figure 1b (upper graph). Data represent means ± SEM, n=3. Analysis of cytoplasmic and
nuclear fractions was performed as in Figure 3a (bottom panels). (b) Immunoblotting of
whole cell lysates with the indicated antibodies, prepared from cells treated with or without
AKTi and/or U0126. (c) Overexpression of a constitutively active AKT mutant (myr-AKT)
blocks cell death in CIB1-depleted cells. Cell viability was quantified as Figure 1b. Data
represent +/- SEM, n=3. Expression of myr-AKT blocks GAPDH nuclear accumulation
(lower panels). Nuclear lysates were immunobloted with anti-GAPDH or -lamin A/C
antibodies.

recapitulated by concurrent AKT and ERK inhibition

Author Manuscript

(a) Cell cycle analysis of propidium iodide-stained control and CIB1-depleted SK-N-SH
cells treated with 25 nM deprenyl or expressing CIB1-sm (CIB1-silent mutation). (b) CIB1depleted cells show induction of DNA damage markers. Analysis of whole cell lysates
prepared from control and CIB1-depleted cells in the absence and presence of deprenyl

populations) shows induction of both γH2AX and p-CHK1. (c) Ectopic expression of CIB1sm in CIB1-depleted cells blocks induction of γH2AX. (d) Ectopic expression of either HAGAPDH-C150S or -K160R blocks induction of γH2AX. (e) Deprenyl does not significantly
rescue the cell proliferation defect in CIB1-depleted cells. Proliferation was quantified as in
Figure 1c. Data represent means ± SEM, n=7. Effect of DEP on the activation and
expression of cell cycle proteins (blots, lower panels). (f) Effect of AKTi and/or U0126 on
proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Proliferation of SK-N-SH cells treated with
and without inhibitors expressed as the fold increase over the cell number at time of cell
plating (time 0) (upper graph). Data represent means ± SEM, n=3. Effect of AKT and/or
ERK inhibition on the activation and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins. Whole cell
lysates were analyzed as in (b) (lower panels).
