Abstract
Myc oncoproteins induce genes driving aerobic glycolysis, including lactate dehydrogenase-A that
generates lactate. Here, we report that Myc controls transcription of the lactate transporter SLC16A1/MCT1
and that elevated MCT1 levels are manifest in premalignant and neoplastic Em-Myc transgenic B cells and in
human malignancies with MYC or MYCN involvement. Notably, disrupting MCT1 function leads to an
accumulation of intracellular lactate that rapidly disables tumor cell growth and glycolysis, provoking
marked alterations in glycolytic intermediates, reductions in glucose transport, and in levels of ATP,
NADPH, and ultimately, glutathione (GSH). Reductions in GSH then lead to increases in hydrogen peroxide,
mitochondrial damage, and ultimately, cell death. Finally, forcing glycolysis by metformin treatment
augments this response and the efﬁcacy of MCT1 inhibitors, suggesting an attractive combination therapy
for MYC/MCT1-expressing malignancies. Cancer Res; 74(3); 908–20. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Myc oncogenic transcription factors are activated in a large
cast of human malignancies, and it has been estimated that
100,000 deaths per year are associated with deregulated MYC
expression (1). Myc drives continuous cell growth and division,
which triggers DNA damage and apoptotic checkpoints that are
then bypassed by mutations that lead to frank malignancy.
Accordingly, forced expression of Myc is sufﬁcient to provoke
tumor formation in mouse models of human cancer (1, 2).
Furthermore, Myc is required to sustain the malignant state, as
Myc inactivation usually provokes rapid tumor regression (3, 4).

Myc oncoproteins are basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper
(bHLH-Zip) transcription factors that regulate a large cast of
targets to coordinate cell growth, metabolism, and division (5).
Myc functions require dimerization with the related bHLH-Zip
partner Max, and Myc:Max dimers activate target genes by
binding to E-box elements (CACGTG; ref. 6). In addition, Myc
represses transcription via inhibitory interactions with the
transcriptional activator Miz-1 (7, 8). Finally, Myc oncoproteins
have recently been suggested to function as universal ampliﬁers of active genes (9, 10), which may occur through their
ability to recruit histone modifying enzymes (11) and/or by
occupying preexisting open chromatin and promoting transcription or pause release at promoters loaded with RNA
polymerase II (9, 10).
Prominent targets induced by Myc include a cast of metabolic enzymes, some of which drive aerobic glycolysis, a
hallmark of cancer cells (12, 13). Indeed, in cell culture models,
Myc oncoproteins induce many aspects of cancer cell metabolism, where Myc targets include glucose and glutamine
transporters, glutaminase and glycolytic enzymes, including
lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A; refs. 14–17).
Increased glycolytic ﬂux in cancer cells leads to high levels of
lactate that is exported by proton-dependent twelve-membrane pass monocarboxylic acid solute transporters coined
MCT1-4 (18). Cell surface expression of MCT1 and MCT4
requires coexpression of the immunoglobulin-like molecule
CD147 (19). Although MCT4 transcription is regulated by
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a; ref. 20) and in renal clear
cell cancer by promoter methylation (21), much less is known
about the control of MCT1 transcription, other than MCT1
expression is elevated in Myc-expressing MCF10 breast epithelial cells and in some tumors (22).

Blocking Lactate Export Disables Cancer Cell Glycolysis

Blocking lactate transport impairs tumor cell growth through
several mechanisms. First, blocking lactate export leads to an
accumulation of lactic acid and decreases intracellular pH (23).
This response seems to contribute to growth arrest of Rastransformed ﬁbroblasts triggered by MCT1 inhibitors and to the
effects of CD147 knockdown on tumor xenografts (24). Second,
some tumor cells rely on lactate as a substrate for oxidative
phosphorylation, and in this scenario blocking lactate import
inhibits tumor cell growth (25, 26). However, this is the exception as most tumor cells express high levels of LDH-A, which
drives the production of lactate from pyruvate (27). Finally,
lactate uptake in vascular endothelial cells via MCT1 seems to
promote tumor angiogenesis; thus blocking this response
impairs tumorigenesis (28, 29). Given these effects, a recent
AstraZeneca patent application claims the use of MCT1 inhibitors for the treatment of certain cancers (30).
Given their effects on aerobic glycolysis, we reasoned that
Myc oncoproteins would control lactate transport. Here, we
report that Myc directly and selectively activates MCT1 transcription and that elevated MCT1 levels are a hallmark of
human malignancies with MYC or MYCN involvement. Notably,
we show that blocking MCT1 function rapidly disables glycolysis, leading to reductions in ATP and glutathione (GSH) levels,
and that cotreatment with metformin, which forces the glycolytic phenotype, augments the in vivo efﬁcacy of MCT1
inhibitors against MYC-expressing malignances.

Materials and Methods
RNA analyses
Total RNA was prepared from B220þ B cells of the spleens or
bone marrow of 4- to 6-week-old wild-type (WT) and premalignant Em-Myc littermates. Lymphomas were from individual
animals. B cells were puriﬁed using magnetic-activated cell
sorting and beads conjugated with antibodies to B220 (Miltenyi). RNA was isolated from puriﬁed B220þ B cells or tumors
using RNA shredder and RNA easy kits (Qiagen) or the
NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel). For quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses, cDNA was synthesized
using iScript reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad), ampliﬁed with
Perfecta Sybr Green (Quanta), and measured using the iCycler
real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Experimental Ct values were
normalized with ubiquitin Ct values and were expressed relative to WT Ct values. Sequences of primers are provided upon
request.
Proliferation, lactate, and ATP assays
Proliferation was measured by counting cells daily or by
MTT assay (Millipore). Lactate was measured using lactate
assay kits [A-108, University of Buffalo (Buffalo, NY) and K607100, BioVision] according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cells cultured at 5  105 cells/mL  MCT1 inhibitors (100
nmol/L) and/or metformin (1 mmol/L) for 24 hours were
washed twice in cold PBS, lysed in 100 mL cold water, and
lactate concentrations measured from the lysate. ATP was
measured using an ATP detection kit (Perkin Elmer) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Raji cells (5  104/well in a
96-well plate) were treated with inhibitors (100 nmol/L) for
indicated times before assay.

siRNA knockdown
MCF7 cells (2.5  105 cells/well) were transfected with 50 to
100 nmol/L siRNA On-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA against
hSLC16a1 (L-007402-00), c-Myc (L-003282-00-0005), or control
siRNA (D-001810-01-05) from Thermo Scientiﬁc together with
3 mL Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen 11668-027) into a 6-well
dish. Cells were incubated for 24 hours before plating for
growth assays, metabolic assays, and protein and RNA isolation. For growth assays, cells were plated at 10,000 cells/well
into 24-well dishes and three wells/day were counted.
Metabolic analysis
Extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were measured using the Seahorse
Bioscience XF96 Analyzer. Before each measurement, wells
were mixed for 2 minutes followed by analyte measurements
every 22 seconds for 5 minutes. Each data point is the change in
analyte concentration over 5 minutes and is reported as ECAR
(mpH/minute) and OCR (pmol oxygen/minute). Agents were
injected into wells through preloaded reagent delivery chambers in the sensor probe. Final concentration of agents used
was MCT1 inhibitors 10 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L, oligomycin 1
mmol/L (Calbiochem), carbonyl cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy)
phenylhyrazone (FCCP) 300 nmol/L (Sigma), and rotenone 100
nmol/L (Sigma). Raji, Daudi, and Ramos Burkitt lymphoma
cells (60,000 cells/well) were adhered to poly-D-lysine–coated
96-well plates by centrifuging. MCF7 cells were plated at 15,000
cells/well the day before analysis. Protein concentration in
wells was measured to normalize ECAR and OCR data.
Glutathione measurements and glutathione rescue
Total glutathione [GSH; GSH plus oxidized GSH (GSSG)]
was measured according the manufacturer's protocol (Cayman's Glutathione Assay Kit) from Raji cells treated with vehicle
or SR13800 (1 mmol/L) for 8 hours. Raji cells (2  105 cells/mL),
cultured in RPMI with FBS, were pretreated with GSH-reduced
ethyl ester (3–5 mmol/L; Sigma) for 1 hour followed by treatment with SR13800 (1 mmol/L) and metformin (1 mmol/L).
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was measured by H2DCFDA. Viability was measured by Trypan blue dye exclusion. Proliferation
was measured by MTT assay 3 days after treatment.

Results
Myc coordinates the control of lactate homeostasis
To assess whether Myc controls lactate production and
export in vivo, we used the Em-Myc transgenic mouse model
of human B lymphoma (1), where a protracted premalignant
state allows one to identify targets that play roles in Myc-driven
tumorigenesis (31, 32). Expression analyses of B220þ splenic
and bone marrow B cells from WT and premalignant Em-Myc
littermates established that Em-Myc B cells express elevated
levels of several glycolytic enzymes, including Ldh-A, and
that this response was augmented in neoplastic Em-Myc B
cells (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
In accordance with these analyses, marked increases in Ldh-A
protein were manifest in Em-Myc versus WT B cells (Fig. 1B), and
the preponderance of Ldh-A versus Ldh-B suggested that pyruvate would be converted to lactate (27). Indeed, intracellular

Blocking Lactate Export Disables Cancer Cell Glycolysis

Em-Myc lymphomas (Supplementary Fig. S1D), presumably
due to hypoxic regions in these tumors (20, 25). Cell surface
expression of MCT1 and CD147 are codependent (19); thus,
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses of CD147
serves as a surrogate for cell surface MCT1. Notably, there were
marked increases in the cell surface levels of CD147 in premalignant and neoplastic Em-Myc B cells versus WT B cells
(Fig. 1F). Thus, there are marked increases in MCT1 expression
during Myc-induced lymphomagenesis.
Elevated MCT1 expression is a hallmark of MYC-driven
malignancies
To determine whether elevated MCT1 expression is manifest
in human malignancies having MYC involvement, we ﬁrst
queried expression datasets of Burkitt lymphoma having
MYC/immunoglobulin chromosomal translocations and of
MYCN-ampliﬁed neuroblastoma (33, 34). Notably, there are
concordantly high levels of MCT1 and MYC mRNA in Burkitt
lymphoma, and of MCT1 and MYCN in MYCN-ampliﬁed neuroblastoma (Fig. 1G and H). In contrast, MCT2, MCT3, and
MCT4 are not speciﬁcally elevated in tumors with MYC/MYCN
involvement; indeed, MCT4 transcript levels are low in MYCexpressing tumors (Fig. 1G and H). Furthermore, the highMCT1/low-MCT4 proﬁle is a hallmark of MYC-expressing colon
cancer (Supplementary Fig. S2A; ref. 35; though normal colon
was heterogeneous in MCT1 mRNA levels) and elevated MCT1
levels are manifest in the squamous carcinoma subtype of
non–small cell lung cancer (Supplementary Fig. S2C; ref. 36).
Lung adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma that
express high levels of MYC also expressed high levels of MCT1,
yet some of these also elevated levels of MCT4, possibly due to
hypoxic regions in these tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2C and
S2D). Finally, a high-MYC-high-MCT1 signature connotes poor
outcome in basal-like breast cancer and all lung cancers
(Supplementary Fig. S2E–S2G).
MCT1 is a Myc transcription target
We evaluated the control of MCT1 expression in human
P493-6 B-lymphoma cells, which bear a tetracycline-repressible c-Myc transgene (37). The induction of c-Myc mRNA and
protein in P493-6 cells deprived of tetracycline was followed by
marked increases in MCT1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2A and B).
These ﬁndings agree with RNA-seq and expression proﬁling
analyses of P493-6 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A; ref. 9).
To test whether Mct1 is also induced by physiologic cues that
control c-Myc, we assessed whether Mct1 expression is cytokine dependent. Primary mouse bone marrow-derived pre-B
cells grown in interleukin (IL)-7 medium were deprived of and
then restimulated with ligand. Like c-Myc, Mct1 expression was
also IL-7 dependent and its induction followed that of c-Myc
(Fig. 2C). Similarly, Mct1 expression in immortal 32D.3 myeloid
cells was IL-3 dependent and followed the induction of c-Myc
(Fig. 2D).
To test whether Myc binds to the endogenous MCT1 gene via
identiﬁed E-boxes, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses in P493-6 cells and 32D.3 myeloid cells.
There was a marked and speciﬁc enrichment for c-Myc binding
to human MCT1 E-box2 and E-box1 in P493-6 cells and to

www.aacrjournals.org

mouse Mct1 E-box1 in IL-3–stimulated 32D.3 cells (Fig. 2E and
F). In contrast, c-Myc binding to human E-box3 or E-box4, or to
mouse E-box4 was not detected (Fig. 2E and F). Similar ﬁndings
were evident in querying the genome-wide ChIP-seq datasets
of Myc and Max target genes in P493-6 cells (9), which showed
that MCT1 was transcriptionally silent until bound by Myc
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). In addition, Myc-directed control of
MCT1 was speciﬁc, as c-Myc knockdown in MCF7 breast
cancer cells impaired proliferation and reduced MCT1 expression but not levels of MCT2 or MCT4 (Fig. 2G), which are
expressed in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Finally, Myc
knockdown selectively reduced the activity of a MCT1 promoter-reporter harboring E-box1 and E-box2 (Fig. 2H). Thus,
MCT1 is a direct Myc transcription target in normal and tumor
cells.
MCT1 is necessary for tumor cell proliferation
Most tumor cells produce and export excess lactate. We thus
reasoned that blocking MCT1 function would impair the
growth of MCT1-expressing tumor cells. Potent and speciﬁc
inhibitors that disable MCT1- and MCT2-directed lactate
transport (but not that of MCT4) block growth of activated
T cells (38, 39). We synthesized two of these pyrole pyrimidinebased molecules [Supplementary Fig. S4A; AR-C122982 (hereafter SR13800) and AR-C155858 (SR13801)] and assessed their
effects on Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells that only express MCT1
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). Both inhibitors blocked Raji cell
proliferation (Fig. 3A and B), at doses at least 10-fold lower than
those needed to impair growth of primary bone marrowderived B cells (Fig. 3C). Growth inhibition was due to proliferative arrest, which was followed by protracted cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). These inhibitors also
blocked MCF7 breast cancer cell growth (Fig. 3D), and that
of Raji Burkitt lymphoma and 70Z3 mouse B-cell lymphoma in
methylcellulose (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
Manipulating MCT1 expression was not feasible in Raji B
lymphoma. Thus, to conﬁrm that these inhibitors were on
target, MCT1 expression was silenced in MCF7 cells. Silencing
MCT1 blocked the growth of MCF7 cells similar to treatment
with the inhibitor (Fig. 3E). We also tested the effects of MCT1
or MCT4 overexpression in MCF7 cells. As expected (19),
overexpression of either transporter increased CD147 levels
(Fig. 3F), and MCT4, but not MCT1, overexpression was
sufﬁcient to confer SR13800 resistance (Fig. 3G). MCT1 overexpression augmented lactate transport (Supplementary Fig.
S4E) and shifted the IC50 for SR13800 in inhibiting transport of
14
C-lactate (Fig. 3H). However, forced expression of MCT1 (or
MCT4) did not affect MCF7 cell proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S4F). Thus, in tumor cells that express MCT1, this transporter is necessary for proliferation but does not augment cell
growth.
MCT1 inhibition derails lactate homeostasis, glycolysis,
and glutathione synthesis
In Raji cells treated with SR13800 or SR13801, there were
immediate increases in the levels of intracellular lactate and a
block in lactate export (Fig. 4A and B). However, levels of
intracellular lactate reached a maximum within approximately

4H). Similar decreases were observed in MCF7 cells following
MCT1 knockdown (Fig. 4I). Furthermore, oligomycin treatment, which blocks ATP synthesis and activates glycolysis,
induced ECAR in vehicle- but not SR13800-treated cells (Fig.
4D). Notably, dissipating the proton gradient with FCCP
revealed that MCT1 inhibition abolishes reserve mitochondrial
capacity (Fig. 4F) without reducing levels of NADH (Fig. 4E), an
electron donor that drives oxidative phosphorylation. Rotenone treatment, which inhibits mitochondrial complex I,
abolished the majority of OCR in Raji cells, and this was
unaffected by SR13800 (Fig. 4F). Thus, MCT1 inhibition rapidly
disables tumor cell metabolism.
To assess the effects of MCT1 inhibition on metabolism, we
measured metabolic intermediates in Raji lymphoma cells by

mass spectrometry. Again, SR13800 treatment led to rapid
increases in the levels of intracellular lactate and corresponding
decreases in extracellular lactate (Fig. 5A and B). Furthermore,
as MCT family members transport pyruvate (18), SR13800
treatment led to marked reductions in extracellular pyruvate
(Fig. 5B). Notably, MCT1 inhibition increased the levels of
glucose- and fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-bisphosphate, and
glycerol-3-phosphate, and markedly reduced products of the
ATP-generating arm of glycolysis, including phosphoglycerate
and pyruvate (Fig. 5A, B, and F). Furthermore, there were
marked reductions in NADPH levels and glucose transport
(Fig. 5C and D). These changes were not associated with
alterations in the levels of glycolytic enzymes (Supplementary
Fig. S5C), and reduced glucose transport was not due to changes
in the cell surface levels of glucose transporters (not shown).

Decreases in NADPH following MCT1 inhibition were not
associated with changes in ribulose-5-phosphate or malate,
two intermediates in NADPH production (Fig. 5E). NADPH is
consumed in the conversion of GSSG to reduced GSH by
GSH reductase. The ﬁrst step of GSH synthesis, the production of g-glutamylcysteine (g-GC), requires ATP (Supplementary Fig. S5D). Thus, we reasoned that MCT1 inhibition
might compromise GSH synthesis. Indeed, by two measures,
MCT1 inhibition led to rapid reductions in g-GC and GSH,
and in total GSH (GSH and GSSG; Fig. 5G). Reductions in
GSH did not reﬂect changes in the levels of the catalytic
(GCLC) and modulatory (GCLM) subunits of glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) that catalyze g-GC production (Supplementary Fig. S5E). Thus, the reductions in ATP levels triggered by inhibiting lactate transport (Fig. 4C) are associated
with reduced levels of GSH.

Metformin augments the potency and antitumor activity
of MCT1 inhibitors
Metformin disables oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by
inhibiting mitochondrial complex I and forces a glycolytic
phenotype that we reasoned may augment sensitivity to MCT1
inhibitors. Though metformin alone had little effect, cotreatment of Raji lymphoma with SR13800 and metformin led to
higher levels of intracellular lactate (Supplementary Fig. S6A),
rapid growth arrest, and cell death (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Synergy of SR13800 and metformin was evident in all MCT1expressing human and mouse tumor cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S6C and S6D), yet had, as expected, no effects on either
MCT4-expressing human tumor cells or upon Em-Myc lymphomas in transplant experiments (not shown), likely due to
hypoxia-mediated induction of Mct4 (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). Thus, metformin augments the anticancer potency of

MCT1/MCT2 inhibitors in tumor cells expressing these
transporters.
The efﬁcacy of SR13800  metformin was tested in vivo using
nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/
SCID) mice injected intravenously with Raji lymphoma, or
injected subcutaneously with MCT1-expressing human
T47D estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analyses conﬁrmed that high levels of MCT1,
but not MCT4, were expressed in both tumor models (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). In vivo drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetic (DMPK) analyses demonstrated that a daily
intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg of SR13800 was sufﬁcient to maintain serum levels above the EC50 of the drug
(5 nmol/L; Fig. 3B), and mice tolerated long-term daily dosing

of SR13800 for >130 days without toxic effects (not shown).
There were also no signiﬁcant effects of SR13800 treatment
on numbers of white or red blood cells that express high
CD147 levels (not shown).
Notably, SR13800 treatment delayed the onset and penetrance of disease relative to vehicle-treated Raji lymphoma
recipients (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7C). In contrast,
metformin treatment (at doses not affecting blood glucose) did
not affect lymphoma onset (Fig. 6A). Recipients treated with
both SR13800 plus metformin had remarkably delayed disease
(Fig. 6A); indeed, some recipients never developed tumors,
even after being taken off drug for over 80 days (data not
shown). In the T47D model, SR13800 and metformin had
comparable activity in impairing tumorigenecity (Fig. 6B).

However, the SR13800/metformin combination was again
superior in blocking tumor growth, without affecting the
health of transplant recipients (Fig. 6B and Supplementary
Fig. S7D–S7F). Thus, MCT1 inhibitors have in vivo anticancer
activity and the MCT1 inhibitor/metformin combination is an
attractive therapeutic strategy for treating MCT1-expressing
malignancies.
Metformin overcomes resistance to MCT1 inhibitors due
to shifts to OXPHOS
To assess whether, in addition to MCT4 expression, there
were other tumor cell intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to
MCT1 inhibitors, Raji cells were cultured with low doses of
SR13800 and surviving cells serially passaged into media having
increased levels in SR13800, to generate independent pools of

lymphoma cells underwent growth arrest (Fig. 6C).
The resistance of RajiR cells was not associated with
MCT4 induction or changes in MCT1 levels (Supplementary
Fig. S8B). However, RajiR cells had elevated levels of intracellular lactate and low ECAR compared with parental Raji
cells growing in normal media (Fig. 6D and E). Notably, RajiR
cells had an increase in OCR compared with parental cells
(Fig. 6E). Treatment of RajiR cells with metformin alone led
to a rapid collapse in metabolism, with a marked reduction
in OCR (Fig. 6F). Although metformin treatment led to
reductions in OCR in parental Raji lymphoma cells, it also,

as predicted, increased ECAR, thus providing energetic
compensation for inhibiting OXPHOS (Fig. 6F). Finally,
metformin alone led to the rapid death of RajiR but not
parental Raji cells (Fig. 6G), demonstrating RajiR cells are
dependent on OXPHOS. Thus, a metabolic shift to OXPHOS
is a mechanism of resistance to MCT1 inhibitors and metformin overcomes this resistance.
Reductions of GSH pools trigger hydrogen peroxideinduced cell death
GSH is a major antioxidant in cells that neutralizes free
radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS; Supplementary Fig.
S5D). Indeed, the marked reduction in GSH in SR13800-treated
Raji cells was followed by increases of H2O2 but not of mitochondrial or cytosolic superoxide anions (Fig. 7A and data

profound increase in H2O2 levels that were associated with the
death of Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells.
ROS compromise the function of mitochondria. Analyses
with MitoTracker Green, which measures mitochondrial mass,
indicated that treatment of Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells with
SR13800, metformin, or SR13800/metformin did not change
mitochondrial mass (Supplementary Fig. S8C). However, analyses with MitoTracker Red, which measures mitochondrial
membrane potential, demonstrated that SR13800 treatment,
and especially SR13800/metformin, triggered marked reductions in numbers of Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells having functional mitochondria (Fig. 7B).

SR13800/metformin compromise tumor cell survival. Indeed,
pretreatment of Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells with the antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or GSH blocked the deleterious
effects of SR13800 and of SR13800/metformin on Raji cell
growth and survival (Fig. 7C–E). Finally, GSH treatment
impaired H2O2 production in SR13800- and SR13800/metformin-treated cells (Fig. 7F). Thus, metabolic demise triggered by
the inhibition of lactate transport leads to a collapse in ATP
pools, reductions in GSH, and increases in H2O2 that contribute
to tumor cell death (Supplementary Fig. S8D).

Discussion
Aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of most tumor types, and
our ﬁndings have established that Myc is sufﬁcient to drive
glycolysis in vivo, where premalignant Em-Myc B cells express
elevated levels of several glycolytic enzymes that leads to
increased lactate levels, in accordance with Ldh-A induction
by Myc in vitro (14, 40). Furthermore, this response is
ampliﬁed in Em-Myc lymphoma. These ﬁndings parallel the
increased dependence on glycolysis and lactate production
manifest during the stepwise transformation of primary
human ﬁbroblasts (41). Finally, in rapidly expanding tumors,
HIF-1a also contributes to glycolysis via the induction of
hypoxia (42).
In cancer cells, glucose transport and glycolytic ﬂux is high,
and this drives the production of ATP and intermediates
necessary for anabolic pathways (43). A consequence of this
shift is the production of toxic levels of lactate. Here, we show
this is diverted by expression of high MCT1 levels in Mycexpressing malignancies and that MCT1 is necessary for the
proliferation of these tumor cells. Furthermore, exporting
lactate into the milieu may play roles in promoting tumor
progression, as lactate can trigger an inﬂammatory response
(44) that drives tumor progression (45). Finally, lactate also
plays other roles in tumorigenesis, where it can be converted
into pyruvate that enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (25,
26) and/or stimulate endothelial cell angiogenesis (28, 29).
Our ﬁndings establish that Myc controls lactate homeostasis
by inducing MCT1 transcription. Pharmacologic inhibition and
knockdown of MCT1 demonstrate the essential role of this
transporter in maintaining the metabolism, growth, survival,
and tumorigenecity of MCT1-expressing tumor cells. These
ﬁndings are consistent with studies showing the anticancer
effects of nonspeciﬁc inhibitors of lactate transporters such as
a-cyanocinnamate (25) and with the block in metabolism and
growth of Ras-transformed ﬁbroblasts ex vivo by MCT1 inhibitors (24). However, the mechanism by which inhibiting
lactate transport compromises cancer cell growth has been
unclear and we now show is due to a collapse in glycolysis and
accompanying reductions in ATP and GSH (Supplementary
Fig. S8D).
Changes in metabolic intermediates suggest how inhibiting lactate export disables glycolysis. In particular, our
ﬁndings are remarkably akin to the changes in glycolytic
intermediates observed in the exercised muscle of LDH-A–
deﬁcient patients, where reduced levels of NADþ compromise glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
activity and favor the oxidation of NADH and the production

918

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

of glycerol-3-phospate by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH; ref. 46). In MCT1 inhibitor-treated cells, intracellular lactate levels and NADH levels rise, suggesting that
the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and the coupled
oxidation of NADH to NADþ are impeded by high intracellular lactate levels. High NADH levels favor GPDH conversion of DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate, which diverts triosephosphates from GAPDH and the ATP-generating arm of
glycolysis (Supplementary Fig. 8SD). As a consequence, this
leads to reductions in phosphoglycerate and pyruvate. This
chain of events, coupled with feedback inhibition by lactate
on PFK1 (47), explains increased levels of more upstream
intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and the
effects upon glucose transport. Speciﬁcally, G-6-P feedback
inhibits hexokinase, which results in increased intracellular
free glucose that then inhibits glucose transport. Collectively
these events converge to markedly impair ATP levels and the
synthesis of the major antioxidant of the cell, GSH, which is a
key target, as GSH is sufﬁcient to override the acute effects of
MCT1 inhibitors on tumor cell survival.
Importantly, these ﬁndings suggest that any agent targeting
glycolysis will compromise ATP production and GSH levels,
resulting in H2O2-induced death. In accordance with this
notion, LDH-A inhibition triggers oxidative stress and blocks
tumor cell proliferation (48) and the antioxidants NAC and
GSH block the antitumor activity of MCT1 inhibitors. Our
ﬁndings also suggest that pro-oxidant therapies will augment
the potency of lactate transport inhibitors and that other
means of disrupting GSH synthesis, for example, by inhibiting
cysteine or cystine transporters (49), will be effective therapeutic strategies for tumors with MYC involvement.
Elevated MCT1 expression is a hallmark of human malignancies with MYC involvement. Notably, many MYC-expressing tumors express reduced MCT4 levels, suggesting MCT1
inhibitors will have a therapeutic beneﬁt in such tumors.
However, it is clear that tumor cells that express MCT4 will
be refractory to MCT1 inhibitors, and that patient tumors
should be assessed for MCT1 and MCT4 expression before
using MCT1 inhibitors for treatment (25). A second mechanism of resistance identiﬁed herein is a shift of tumor cells to
OXPHOS, and we show that agents such as metformin that
disrupt OXPHOS disable this resistance, leading to a collapse in
tumor cell metabolism and rapid death. Notably metformin
use in type-II diabetes seems to decrease cancer risk and may
provide beneﬁt as a cancer therapeutic (50). Together, these
ﬁndings support the use of MCT1 inhibitors in combination
with metformin, or with metformin derivatives, in therapies for
MCT1- and MYC-expressing malignancies.
