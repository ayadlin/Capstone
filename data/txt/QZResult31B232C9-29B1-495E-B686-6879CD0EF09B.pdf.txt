ABSTRACT
The Hippo pathway significantly correlates with organ size control and
tumorigenesis. The activity of YAP/TAZ, a transducer of the Hippo pathway, is required
to sustain self-renewal and tumor-initiation capacities in cancer stem cells (CSCs).
But, upstream signals that control the mammalian Hippo pathway have not been well
understood. Here, we reveal a connection between the Protease-activated receptor
1 (PAR1) signaling pathway and the Hippo-YAP pathway in gastric cancer stem-like
cells. The selective PAR1 agonist TFLLR-NH2 induces an increase in the fraction of side
population cells which is enriched in CSCs, and promotes tumorigenesis, multi cancer
drug resistance, cell morphological change, and cell invasion which are characteristics
of CSCs. In addition, PAR1 activation inhibits the Hippo-YAP pathway kinase Lats via
Rho GTPase. Lats kinase inhibition in turn results in increased nuclear localization
of dephosphorylated YAP. Furthermore, PAR1 activation confers CSCs related traits
via the Hippo-YAP pathway, and the Hippo-YAP pathway correlates with epithelial
mesenchymal transition which is induced by PAR1 activation. Our research suggests
that the PAR1 signaling deeply participates in the ability of multi drug resistance and
tumorigenesis through interactions with the Hippo-YAP pathway signaling in gastric
cancer stem-like cells. We presume that inhibited YAP is a new therapeutic target in
the treatment human gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by dysregulated PAR1
or its agonists. The Hippo pathway significantly correlates with organ size control and

INTRODUCTION

transcriptional repressor and ultimately EMT in gastric
cancer cells [21, 22]. In this study, we investigated the
transformation into CSCs by activated PAR1 and the
functional relationship between activated PAR1 signaling
and Hippo-YAP regulation in gastric cancer. We show
that stimulation of PAR1 by agonist peptide TFLLRNH2 activates YAP by dephosphorylation and activation
of YAP increases its nuclear localization which in turn
increases the rate of side population cell formation,
which is enriched with CSCs. Gastric cancer cell lines
acquire multidrug resistance and tumorigenesis by PAR1
activation. As well as, PAR1 acts through RhoA, Lats
and YAP to stimulate gene expression of cell migration.
Our study indicates a novel function of PAR1 in Hippo
pathway regulation and activated PAR1 confers CSCs
traits in gastric cancer.

Neoplasm is an abnormal growth in tissues
and organs which undergo constant remodeling and
regeneration. As these processes are normally maintained
by stem cells, this has led to the attractive hypothesis that
tumor initiation and progression are also driven by cancer
stem-like cells (CSCs). CSCs are defined as those cells
that can generate tumors through the stem cell processes
of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types
[1].
Side population is a flow cytometry (FCM) term to
define cell clusters with strong ability to efflux DNA dye
Hoechst 33342 via ABC-transporters [2]. Side population
cells have been widely reported to be enriched in various
cancerous tissues such as breast cancer [3], gastrointestinal
system tumor [4], and small-cell lung cancer [5] as well
as from cell lines such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma [6],
hepatocellular carcinoma [7], and bladder cancer cell lines
[8]. Remarkably, side population cells, with stemness
potential, can form xenograft tumors in animals and are
resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, contributing
to tumor relapse [9]. The cancer side population cells
are highly enriched with tumorigenic stem-like cancer
cells [10]. And side population cells of pancreatic
cancer predominated in TGF-beta induced epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion, but Main
population cells did not respond to TGF-beta induced
invasion [11]. These findings suggest that side population
cells are strongly correlated to EMT in cancer cell.
The Hippo pathway was initially defined by genetic
studies in Drosophila, wherein mosaic mutations of
Hippo pathway genes resulted in tissue overgrowth [12].
And its core components in organ size regulation were
evolutionally conserved in mammals [13]. In the Hippo
pathway, a conserved kinase cascade in which the protein
kinase MST1/2 phosphorylates and activates the Lats1/2
kinase functions to inhibit YAP and TAZ transcription coactivators by phosphorylation. Dephosphrylated YAP/TAZ
localize in the nucleus and function as transcription coactivators for the TEAD family to induce gene expression,
including connective tissue growth factor and Cyr61,
thereby promoting cell growth, proliferation, and survival
[14-16]. Several recent studies have clearly established
a role of the Hippo pathway in regulating cell contact
inhibition, organ size control, and cancer development [1719]. In addition it is essential both during developmental
growth and in maintaining homeostasis of adult organs,
and when deregulated it can cause tumorigenesis [20]. The
Hippo pathway has major roles in the modulation of cell
proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation.
We showed activated Protease-activated receptor-1
(PAR1), which is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
and activated when thrombin cleaves the aminoterminal extracellular domain at a specific site, promoted
cell invasion and induced Snail mediated E-cadherin

RESULTS
Activated PAR1 has potential to induce gastric
cancer cell to side population subpopulation
The side population phenotype as identified by
low Hoechst 33342 blue/red fluorescence intensity
was detected in 1-3 % of MKN45/mock cells. The side
population was detected in 10-16% of MKN45/PAR1 and
MKN74 cells which were treated with TFLLR-NH2 24 h.
But the loss of the side population was for MKN45/PAR1
and MKN74 cells with TFLLR-NH2 either by addition of
SCH79797 or knockdown of PAR1 gene by PAR1 siRNA
(Figure 1). PAR1 knockdown MKN74 cell by transfected
PAR1 siRNA was shortened to MKN74/PAR1(-) (Figure
S1).

Activated PAR1 induced tumor-initiating
potential and spheroid colony formation
Both MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells, which were
treated with TFLLR-NH2, presented morphological change
in the monolayer conditions (Figure 2A), and formed
many large spheroid colonies when cultured in ultra-low
attachment conditions (Figure 2B). However, MKN45/
mock cells did not change their cellular morphology.
Cellular morphology was also unchanged for cultures of
MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells in which PAR1 activity
was suppressed by the addition of SCH79797 or siRNA
(Figure 2A). In addition, these cells formed a few small
spheroid colonies when cultures in ultra-low attachment
conditions (Figure 2B).
With regard to evaluation of tumor proliferation
in the nude mice, typically large tumor nodules on the
peritoneum, as well as an abundant tumor spread across
the peritoneal muscle layer, mesentery and the diaphragm
was observed in MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells which

were pretreated with TFLLR-NH2 group (Figure 2C).
The statistical analysis of the ratios of tumor weight
over total situs weight proved that PAR1 activated gastric
cancer cell by TFLLR-NH2 resulted in a significant
increase of tumor burden (MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74
cells treated by TFLLR-NH2 versus control, P < 0.05;
Figure 2D). The peritoneal dissemination tumor weight
of MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells treated with TFLLRNH2 plus SCH79797 were small as compared to MKN45/
PAR1 and MKN74 pretreated with TFLLR-NH2 alone (P
< 0.05; Figure 2D).

MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells treated with TFLLRNH2 showed drug resistance compared to control of
these cells (P < 0.05; Figure 3A). But both MKN45/
PAR1 and MKN74 cells with PAR1 activity suppressed
by SCH79797 or PAR1 siRNA presented an inhibition of
resistance to these drugs (Figure 3A).
Next, we observed ATP-binding cassette transporter
(ABC-transporter), ABCG2, MRP1 and P-gp expression
by means of western blot assay. MKN45/PAR1 and
MKN74 cells which were treated with TFLLR-NH2
presented increased expression levels of ABCG2 relative
to cultures of these cells in which PAR1 activation was
suppressed or PAR1 was the non-stimulating condition
(Figure 3B). We profiled RPN2 expression by western
blotting assay. RPN2 increases glycosylation status
of P-gp. And when P-gp is glycosylated, it has been
shown to take part in drug egest [23]. We profiled the
glycosylation patterns by means of western blots in
which glycosylated P-gp, appears on blots as mature 170kDa bands and un-glycosylated P-gp as 140-kDa bands.
The 140-kDa unglycosylated P-gp was clearly found in
MKN45/mock cells (Figure 3B). In MKN45/PAR1 and
MKN74 cells which PAR1 activation was supressed by

to various conditions, in a dose-dependent manner. Both

P-gp was found, and trace amounts of glycosylated P-gp
was found just a little (Figure 3B). In contrast, MKN45/
PAR1 and MKN74 cells treated by TFLLR-NH2 expressed
glycosylated 170-kDa matured P-gp (Figure 3B).
Similarly, immunohistochemistry indicated that ABCG2,
P-gp, and RPN2 were highly expressed in the peritoneal
dissemination mass in nude mice (Figure 3C).

in nuclear and dephosphorylated YAP as indicated by
western blot assays (Figure 4A). Immunofluorescence
assay indicated that Dephosphorylated YPA moved into
the nucleus under conditions in which PAR1 activity
was stimulated (Figure 4C). Under conditions of
supressed PAR1 activation of MKN45/PAR1 cells, we
found that phosphorylated YAP was highly abundant in
the cytoplasmic lysate and YAP did not move into the
nucleus (Fig. 4B and 4C). Similarly, under conditions in
whichPAR1 activation was supressed in MKN74 cells,
YAP did not move into the nucleus as indicated by western
blot and immunofluorescence assays (Figure 4B and 4C).

PAR1 stimulation induces YAP dephosphorylation
and nuclear localization
In search of Hippo-YAP signalling pathway,
we found that YAP was much more abundant in the
cytoplasmic lysate relative to the slight amounts observed
in the nuclear lysate in MKN45/mock and MKN74 cells
(Figure 4A). But addition of TFLLR-NH2 to MKN45/
PAR1 and MKN74 cells resulted in a rapid decrease
in cytoplasmic and phosphorylated YAP, and increase

TFLLR-NH2 increases YAP dephosphorylation

to induce YAP dephophorylation [24, 25]. We analysed

the function of Rho in TFLLR-NH2-induced YAP
dephosphorylation. To determine the function of Rho in
YAP regulation, we tested the effect of botulinum toxin C3
(for 5 h), a specific inhibitor of Rho GTPase, and Y27632
(for 4 h), Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, on
YAP phosphorylation. Western blot assays indicate that
C3 treatment strongly suppressed YAP dephosphorylation
in both MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells treated with
TFLLR-NH2 (Figure 5A). Immunofluorescence assays
of both MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells treated with
TFLLR-NH2 and C3 indicate that YAP did not moved
into the nucleus (Figure 5B). In contrast, Inhibition of
ROCK by Y27632 treatment had a marginal effect on
TFLLR-NH2 induced YAP dephosphorylation and nuclear
localization (Figure 5A and 5B).
Lats1/2 forms a cascade to increase YAP
phosphorylation [26]. We analyzed Lats1 kinase activity
to determine whether Lats1/2 kinase is involved in YAP
regulation. TFLLR-NH2 treatment resulted inhibition
of Lats1 kinase and C3 treatment blocked TFLLRNH2 induced inhibition of Lats1 kinase (Figure 5C).
Additionally, there is an observed relationship between

Lats1 inactivation and YAP phosphorylation (Figure 5C).

Hippo-YAP pathway promotes cancer cell
migration and morphology change, and
maintained cancer stem-like cell
We reported that PAR1 activation conducted
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lead Snail
to move into the nucleus in human gastric cancer [22]. We
are now investigating the relationship between the HippoYAP pathway and EMT. We prepared knockdown of Snail
and YAP in MKN45 and MKN74 cells by transfected each
siRNA (Figure S2). In Snail siRNA transfected MKN45/
PAR1 and MKN74 cells, we found that Dephosphorylated
YAP moved into the nucleus and phpsphorylated Lats1
was inhibited expression by western blot assays, when
these cells were treated by TFLLR-NH2 (Figure 6A).
Subsequently, we analyzed whether EMT was induced by
TFLLR-NH2, when Hippo-YAP pathway was inhibited.
Western blot assays indicated that the EMT markers
E-cadherin and fibronectin as well as morphology were

DISCUSSION

unchanged in both MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells
treated with C3 and TFLLR-NH2 (Figure 6B and 6C).
In addition, C3 treatment resulted in cell migration and
invasion that was significantly reduced compared to PAR1
activated cells (Figure 6E, 6F and Video S1, S2, S4, S5).
Knockdown of YAP as well as the C3 treatment efficiently
blocked cell migration, invasion and cell morphology
change, and E-cadherin and fibronectin expression levels
were not impacted (Figure 6B, 6C, 6E, 6F, and Video
S3, S6). Moreover, C3 treatment and knockdown of
YAP resulted in Snail not being detected among nuclear
proteins (Figure 6B). Furthermore, C3 treatment and
knockdown of YAP efficiency blocked increase in side
population cells, when MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells
were treated by TFLLR-NH2 (Figure 6D).

High PAR1 expression was found in tumors
including malignant melanoma and breast cancer [2729] and correlated with invasiveness and motility of
numerous cancer cell lines, indicating that PAR1 might
act as an oncogene. In addition PAR1 contributes to
leukemic stem cell maintenance [30]. In this study, we
demonstrate that PAR1 activation induced gastric cancer
cells to side population cells which acquired efflux
chemotherapy resistance, and PAR1 activity inhibits
YAP phosphorylation and increases YAP activity via
Rho GTPase. We also showed that PAR1 correlates with
Hippo-YAP pathway in mediation of the physiological
functions of cancer cell migration and invasion. These

cells. F. Invasion assay shows MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells, which were pretreated with C3 for 5 h or YAP1 was knocked down

data indicated that PAR1 significantly correlated to gastric
cancer stem-like cell maintenance and gastric cancer cell
invasion through Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in the
downstream of PAR1.
CSCs are defined as a group of cells within a tumor
that can self-renew and drive tumorigenesis. Cancer
cells in a side population are enriched with tumorigenic
stem-like cancer cells [10]. We showed that activated
PAR1 promoted the propagation of side population
cells with efflux drug resistance and had a high tumorinitiating capacity. GPCR signaling correlates with cancer
development as both familial and somatic activating
mutations of GPCRs have been linked to human cancer
[31]. PAR1 is also a member of GPCR. Thrombin’s (PAR1
agonist) actions on endothelial cells contribute to vascular
development and hemostasis in the mouse embryo [32].
These data and reports suggest that activated PAR1
signaling increases the pool of CSCs.
Several reports have demonstrated that thrombin
increases the expression of connective tissue growth factor
and Cyr61 which are increased gene expression by the
TEAD family [33-35]. Dephosphorylated YAP localizes
in the nucleus and function as a transcription coactivators
for TEAD family [15]. We showed recently that activated

PAR1 triggered the activation of Rho GTPase. And this
study shows that activation of PAR1 inhibits Lats1/2
kinase via Rho GTPase, not the ROCK pathway, leading to
eventual YAP dephosphorylation, and nuclear localization.
We have also shown that when Rho GTPase is inhibited by
C3, side population cells which were enriched with CSCs,
do not increase as was observed under PAR1 activation
do. The Hippo pathway can control its effects on tissue
size by the direct regulation of stem cell proliferation
and maintenance [36]. We indicate that PAR1 activation
suppresses Hippo-YAP pathway via Rho GTPase, and the
connection between PAR1 and Hippo signaling pathway
increases CSCs proliferation.
We reported that PAR1 activation by thrombin
induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via
Snail [22]. And YAP and TAZ have also been shown to
induce EMT in human breast epithelial cells in a Teaddependent manner [37]. Lats2 acts as a positive modulator
of Snail1 protein level and potentiates its in vivo EMT
activity [38]. And YAP potentiates Smad signaling to
increase expression of the downstream target genes Snail,
Slug, and Twist1, which are important transcriptional
regulators of EMT [39]. At this time, we have shown that
the Hippo-YAP pathway undergoing PAR1 activation

is deeply involved with in the induction of EMT. When
PAR1 signaling via Rho was inhibited or YAP underwent
knockdown, EMT markers E-cadherin and fibronectin
expression levels were not changed significantly and
cell motility were markedly reduced. Migration is an
important initial step in EMT and this decrease in cell
motility further underlines the importance of PAR1. When
Snail underwent knockdown, we confirmed that YAP was
dephosphorylated and localized in nucleus under the
influence of TFLLR-NH2. These data implicates that the
Hippo-YAP signaling pathway caused by activated PAR1
significantly increased with the intranuclear mobility of
Snail which was promoted by PAR1 activation, and so
this signaling pathway induced EMT in oncogenesis.
The pathways established are summarized in the scheme
shown in Figure 7.
Elevated YAP nuclear localization is observed in
many human cancers [40], but the mechanism upstream
(behind) YAP activation in cancer is unknown. The
relationship between PAR1 and Hippo pathway clarified
by this study may provide a better understanding of the
role of YAP activation in gastric cancer. PAR1 is widely
expressed in many cell types and has been involved in a
wide range of physiological regulation. Degenerated PAR1
signaling is implicated in tumor cell invasion. Activated
PAR1 and the Rho signaling pathway can cause unusual
cell growth, and ligands of PAR1 are increased under the
pathophysiological conditions. For instance, thrombin
and PAR1 expression are up-regulated in a tumor
microenvironment and invasive cancer cells. We speculate
that dephosphorylation of YAP by PAR1 may correlate
with cancer invasion and metastasis. We hypothesize that
activated PAR1 expression holds the potential for the new
predictive factors of chemotherapeutic resistance in the
systemic treatment of human gastric cancer, and inhibition
of YAP will be a new approach to treat gastric cancer
caused by dysregulated PAR1 and its selective agonists.

Cell culture and transfection
The human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN45 and
MKN74 cells, were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank
and we had established PAR1 stable expressing MKN45
cell (MKN45/PAR1) [21]. Cells were cultured at 37°C
in 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). Cancer cells
seeded before the experiment were gently detached from
the surface using Accutase (innovative cell technologies).
Endogenous PAR1 is expressed in MKN74, not in
MKN45 [21]. MKN45/mock and MKN74 cells served
as control cells in this experiment. Ten nM siRNA was
introduced into cells by transient transfection with RNAi
MAX (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Four days after the transfection, protein was
extracted, and knockdown of target protein was confirmed
by western blot assays.

Western blotting assay
Whole, Cytoplasmic and nuclear cell protein was
extracted using RIPA-buffer (Wako) containing 1%
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and NE-PER (Thermo
Scientific). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a
5-20% SuperSep gel (Wako) and analyzed by Western blot
using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Imunostar, Wako)
was used to visualize of immunoreactive-bands after the
reaction with the HRP-labeled secondary antibody against
mouse or rabbit IgG.

Immunoprecipitation and kinase assay
For the Lats1 kinase assay, both MKN45/PAR1
and MKN74 cells were transfcted with pGEX-KG-GSTYAP (Addgene). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min
at 4 oC, and the supernatants obtained by centrifugation
were incubated with Lats1 anyibodies for 2 h at 4 oC, and
Dynabeads protein A/G (VERITAS) were added in for 1
h. Immunoprecipitated Lats1 was subjected to a kinase
assay in presence of 500 μM cold ATP and GST-YAP as

substrate. The phosphorylation of GST-YAP at S127 was
determined by immunoblotting using pYAP1 antibody.

Spheroid colony formation assay were performed
in ultra-low attachment 96-well culture dish (Corning).
These cells were exposed to TFLLR-NH2 for 12 h, and
incubated for a minimum of 72 h at 37°C/ 5% CO2 and
95% humidity. Then we counted spheroid formation.

Immunofluorescence
Cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS and blocked with 3% FBS in PBS.
Following overnight incubation at 4°C with primary
antibodies, and incubation in the dark with Alexa 633 Fluor
dye-labeled secondary antibody, immunofluorescence was
detected using a Leica DMLB confocal laser fluorescence
microscope (Leica Microsystems).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of side
population
Side population analysis was done as previously
described before [41]. Cells were incubated with Hoechst
33342 (Sigma) for 90 min at a final concentration of 5 µg/
ml, and analysed by FACS (FACSVantage SE, equipped
with FACS DIVA software, version 6.0; BD Biosciences).
Dual-wavelength FACS analysis identified a side branch
of ‘Hoechst-low’ cells as the side population, further
verified by co-adding verapamil (100 µM; Sigma) which
results in reduction of the side population size by blocking
the dye efflux through multidrug transporter(s).

Immunohistochemistory
The tumor tissues were routinely fixed in 10%
paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The
sections were dewaxed using xylene and rehydrated in
graded alcohols. The sections were incubated overnight
with the primary antibodies at 4°C in a humidified
chamber. The sections were incubated for 60 min at room
temperature with labeled-dextran polymer (Envision;
Dako). The sections were developed with activated
3’-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride (DAB) for 5 min.
The positive cells exhibited the deposition of brown DAB
precipitate.

Drug resistance assay
Cell viabilities in response to chemotherapeutic
induction, and the degrees of cytotoxicity of Cisplatin,
5-FU and Paclitaxel on the cells were measured using cell
counting kit CCK-8 (DOJINDO). The number of viable
cells is directly proportional to the amount of the formazan
dye generated in cells. Animal studies
Pathogen-free, 6-week-old, female BALB/cAJclnu/nu mice (CLEA Japan) were housed in microisolator
cages maintained in a barrier facility. All the mice had
a body weight of between 20 and 25 g at the start of
treatment, complying with the standards set out in the
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
in the University of Fukui. Each group was composed of
five female athymic nude mice. And these nude mice were
inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 106 cells which were
treated under varying conditions. One group was MKN45/
mock, MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells as control group.
The second and third group were that MKN45/PAR1 and
MKN74 cells which were pretreated by TFNLLR-NH2
for 24 h together before inoculation. The 4th and 5th group
were that MKN45/PAR1 and MKN74 cells which were
pretreated by TFNLLR-NH2 plus SCH79797 for 24 h
together before inoculation. The mice sacrificed 30 days
after tumor injection. We examined the size and number
tumors in the abdomen. The relative tumor burden in each
mouse was calculated by dividing tumor mass weight by
total situs weight.

Cell invasion assay
Invasion of cells through matrigel was determined
using a Transwell system (CHEMICON) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. Both TFLLR-NH2
and C3 were added to the cells (0.5×106 cells/well) in
the upper well containing serum-free medium. The A560
nm of the MKN45/mock, MKN74 and MKN45/PAR1
cells cultured under noted conditions were determined
and compared using the A560 nm of MKN45/mock and
MKN74 cultured under a PAR1 agonist-free condition as
a baseline.

Scratched and time lapse assay
The cells were seeded into 6-well plates to 80-90%
confluence and the cell monolayer scratched in a straight
line with a 200 μl pipette tip to create a scratch. Then
the culture was re-fed with TFLLR-NH2. Images were
taken at a 0 and 24 h after the scratch to calculate the cell
migrationrate. For time-lapse video microscopy, mitotic
cells were shaken off the plates and seeded into a sixwell plate containing etched coverslips (Bellco) coated
with polylysine. Timelapse images were recorded with an
Olympus MicroSuite™-B3SV.
