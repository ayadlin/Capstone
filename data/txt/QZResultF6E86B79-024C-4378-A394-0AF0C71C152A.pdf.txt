ABSTRACT
How Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) affects the clinical outcome of EBV-positive diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains largely unknown. The viral oncogene LMP1 is
at the crux of tumorigenesis and cell survival. Therefore, we examined the association
between LMP1high cells drug resistance. We first assessed SLAMF1 as a surrogate
marker for LMP1high cells. LMP1 and its target gene CCL22 were highly expressed
in SLAMF1high Farage cells. These cells survived longer following treatment with a
combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP).
Genes associated with interferon-alpha, allograft rejection, NF-κB and STAT3 were also
overexpressed in the surviving Farage cells. Specifically, CHOP treatment increased
IL10, LMP1 and pSTAT3 expression levels in a dose-dependent fashion. Addition of
exogenous IL4 greatly increased the levels of LMP1 and pSTAT3, which rendered the
Farage cells more resistant to CHOP by up-regulating the anti-apoptotic genes BCL-XL
and MCL1. The Farage cells were sensitive to Velcade and STAT3, 5, and 6 inhibitors.
Inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3, in combination with CHOP, decreased LMP1 levels and
effectively induced cell death in the Farage cells. We suggest that LMP1high cells are
responsible for the poor drug response of EBV+ DLBCL and that perturbation of the
NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways increases toxicity in these cells.

INTRODUCTION

Somatic mutations in TRAF3, CARD11, CD79A/B,
TNFAIP3/A20 and MYD88, which activate the NF-κB
signaling pathway, were identified in EBV- DLBCL
[12–15]. Although a deletion mutation in TNFAIP3 has
been reported in 1 of 8 EBV+ DLBCL samples tested
[16], other mutations associated with NF-κB activation
have yet to be identified in EBV+ DLBCL. Among the
EBV latent genes, LMP1 expression may account for
the oncogenic activation of NF-κB in EBV+ DLBCL.
LMP1 is a transmembrane protein that constitutively
activates both classical and alternative NF-κB
signaling pathways without ligands [17–18]. LMP1
also activates the p38, JNK, mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
IRF7, and STAT pathways [18–19]. In a mouse model,
transgenic expression of LMP1 in B cells was sufficient
to develop lymphoma that resembled human DLBCL
under immunosuppression, which mimics EBV+ DLBCL
[9]. Since LMP1 has been demonstrated to increase

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive (+) diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for 4–11% of all
cases of DLBCL [1–3]. EBV+ DLBCL exhibits relatively
few genetic alterations compared with EBV- DLBCL [4].
However, EBV+ DLBCL is associated with poor prognosis
and a median survival of 2 years in Asian populations
[1–2, 5–8]. Viral oncogenes and immunosuppression have
been suggested to play important roles in tumorigenesis
[9]. However, precisely how the presence of EBV affects
current chemotherapies in EBV+ DLBCL remains largely
unknown.
Most cases of EBV+ DLBCL, particularly in Asia, have
shown an activated B cell (ABC)-like immunophenotype,
which is consistent with the substantial NF-κB activation that
was revealed by immunohistochemistry and gene expression
profiles [4, 8, 10–11]. NF-κB activation is a common feature
that occurs through various mechanisms in ABC-DLBCL.

drug resistance in lymphoma cells [20], LMP1-driven
constitutive NF-κB activation, in cooperation with the
multifunctional effect of LMP1 on diverse signaling
pathways, may be responsible for the poorer prognosis of
EBV+ DLBCL.
LMP1 expression can be induced in vitro, in
the absence of the viral trans-activators EBNA2, by
cytokines such as IL10, IL13 and IL4 [21–22]. LMP1
induction by these cytokines is mediated by the STAT3
or STAT6 signaling pathways. Reversely LMP1 also
induces IL10 in EBV-infected B cells, which forms an
autocrine feed-forward regulatory loop between IL10 and
LMP1 [23–24]. IL10 is involved in the proliferation and
autonomous growth of EBV-transformed B cells [25–26].
Histologically, EBV+ tumor cells in EBV+ DLBCL have
been detected within a background of extensive infiltrating
immune cells, including histocytes, mast cells, and T cell
subsets [27]. Previously, we identified the overexpression
of several T cell-recruiting chemokines in EBV+ DLBCL
[4]. Oyama et al. revealed the co-expression of LMP1 and
the chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 and found that LMP1+
tumor cells were closely surrounded by CCR4+ Th2 cells
and regulatory T cells [28]. This finding implies that the
cytokines IL4 and IL10 that are secreted by the recruited T
cells can modulate the expression levels of LMP1 in tumor
cells. Therefore, the tumor microenvironment may support
the drug resistance and immune evasion of LMP1+ cells
in EBV+ DLBCL.
Currently, patients diagnosed with EBV+ DLBCL
are treated with an anthracycline-based combination
chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). The addition
of the CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to CHOP
treatment has been tested, however no significant
improvements have been observed [5, 7]. How the EBV+
DLBCL cells respond to CHOP therapies and the underlying
mechanism of CHOP resistance remains largely unknown.
In this study, we isolated cells with high levels of LMP1
expression by using the cell surface marker SLAMF1
(CD150) and analyzed the gene expression profiles of
CHOP-resistant cells. We also tested the effect of IL4 on
CHOP resistance. Finally, we assessed the synergistic effect
of inhibiting phosphorylated STATs in combination with an
NF- κB inhibitor.

activated cell sorting (FACS). We included the three cell
lines Raji, Toledo and IM-9 as controls. More than 50%
of Farage cells were BCL6 and IRF4 positive and CD10
negative in Farage cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Based
on Han’s algorithm [31], this finding suggests that most of
the Farage cells are a non-GCB type.
The expression level of LMP1 varies widely
between individual EBV-infected tumor cells in vivo and
in vitro [28, 32]. We hypothesized that at the level of the
single cell, EBV+ cells exhibit differenttial drug responses
that are correlated with LMP1 expression. To isolate live
cells with differential LMP1 levels, a cell surface marker
associated with LMP1 expression levels was required
because there are no available commercial anti-LMP1
antibodies to isolate LMP1-positive live cells. SLAMF1
was highly induced in EBV infected lymphoblastoid
cells [33] and induced by ectopic expression of LMP1
through the NF-κB signaling pathway [34]. We therefore
tested whether SLAMF1 expression levels correlated with
LMP1 expression levels. SLAMF1 is expressed on the
cell surface of almost all Farage cells (Figure 1A). Then,
we sorted the top, middle and bottom 10% of the Farage
cells according to SLAMF1 expression levels (Figure 1B).
We labeled these fractions SLAMF1high, SLAMF1inter and
SLAMF1low. The average cell size of the SLAMF1high
cells was larger than that of the SLAMF1low cells.
Approximately 55% of the SLAMF1high cells were in the
S/G2/M phase of the cell cycle, whereas most SLAMF1low
cells were in the G1 phase (Figure 1B). When cultured
in growth media, SLAMF1high cells repopulated faster
than SLAMF1low cells (Figure 1C and 1D). This result
indicates that high SLAMF1 expression is associated with
continued cell proliferation and/or cell cycle progression.
We next performed western blotting for SLAMF1,
LMP1, phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (Ser536), and BCL2
(Figure 1E). SLAMF1 was most abundant protein in the
SLAMF1high cells, which was concordant with the LMP1
and BCL2 expression levels, but phosphorylated NF-κB
p65 did not correlate with the LMP1 levels. To test
whether cell surface expression of SLAMF1 correlates
with LMP1 expression at the single cell level, we fixed
and sorted cells after labeling them with primary and
secondary antibodies. As shown in Figure 1F, SLAMF1
expression levels are correlated with those of LMP1.
We next compared the gene expression profiles of
SLAMF1high cells and SLAMF1low cells. The GO term
analysis of the differentially expressed genes suggested
that most of the enriched gene sets are associated with the
mitotic cell cycle and chromosome segregation (Figure 2A
and Supplementary Table 1), which were consistent with
the results observed in the cell cycle analysis (Figure 1B).
Genes associated with inflammation were enriched in the
SLAMF1high cells, including CCL22, TNFSF4, IL2RA,
CD44 and TLR7 (Supplementary Table 1). Especially,
CCL22, a chemokine that attracts T cells expressing CCR4
including regulatory T cells (Tregs), showed the highest

RESULTS
LMP1 and CCL22 are highly expressed in
SLAM high Farage cells
Farage cells are an EBV+ DLBCL cell line that was
derived from a 70-year-old woman [29]. Farage cells are
considered a CD20- and CD19-positive germinal center B
cell-like (GCB) type of lymphoma [30]. To confirm the cell
of origin for the Farage cells, we analyzed the expression
of BCL6, IRF4/MUM1, and CD10 by using fluorescencewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

fold changes (Figure 2B). We confirmed the elevated
expression of CCL22 in SLAMF1high cells by ELISA
(Figure 2C). Our results are consistent with a previous
report [28] showing that CCL22 is co-expressed in diffuse
large B cells that express high levels of LMP1 in vivo.
Collectively, the expression level of SLAMF1 at the cell
surface functionally correlates with the LMP1 level in
a single cell, and the LMP1high cells are enriched in the
SLAMF1high Farage cell fraction.

doses of CHOP for 2 days and analyzed the expression
level of cell surface SLAMF1 by FACS (Figure 3B).
SLAMF1 was clearly shifted toward a higher expression
level (up to 1 μg/ml CHOP), but most cells died at
concentration of 10 μg/ml CHOP (Figure 3B and 3C).
CHOP interfered with the G1/S transition, and cells at
G2/M phase accumulated (Figure 3D). A subG1 fraction
of cells representative of apoptotic cells were increased
(Figure 3D). Likewise, SLAMF1high cells seemed to be
enriched after CHOP treatment in EBV+ Jijoye and IM-9
cells (Figure 3E). However, the same pattern was not
observed in a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) (Figure 3F),
which suggested that the enrichment of SLAMF1high cells
by CHOP might be tumor specific.
To examine the molecular features of the cells that
survived CHOP treatment, we generated gene expression
profiles using microarrays. We analyzed the significantly
enriched gene sets and pathways in CHOP-treated Farage
cells compared with non-treated Farage cells. Overexpressed
gene sets in the CHOP-treated cells are involved in
interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma responses and
allograft rejection (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table 2).

SLAMF1high cells are more resistant to CHOP
treatment
Ectopic expression of LMP1 renders cells more
resistant to anti-cancer drugs [20]. LMP1 was highly
expressed in SLAMF1high Farage cells (Figure 1E);
therefore, we assessed whether the SLAMF1high cells are
enriched after CHOP treatment. We treated Farage cells
with various doses of CHOP for 3 days and determined
their cell viability with the WST-1 reagent (Figure 3A).
The IC50 of CHOP in the Farage cells was approximately
0.18 μg/ml. We then treated the Farage cells with three

Farage cells. (B) Farage cells were labeled with FITC-anti-SLAMF1 and the top and bottom 10% of the labeled cells were sorted. The cell
cycle distribution in each group was analyzed. (C) The sorted SLAMF1high and SLAMF1low cells were seeded and cultured for 2 weeks.
Larger cell clumps were observed in the SLAMF1high cells compared with the SLAMF1low cells, which suggested that the SLAMF1high cells
have more regrowth potential. (D) Cell proliferation was also assessed with a cell viability test using the WST-1 reagent. The O.D. score
correlates with viable cell numbers. The higher O.D. score for the SLAMF1high cells supported our hypothesis that the cell clumps resulted
from cell proliferation rather than simple cell aggregation (*p < 0.05). (E) Western blotting for SLAMF1, LMP1, phosphor-NF-κB p65

Especially, STAT2, TAP1, CXCL10, GBP4, CASP1,
TXNIP, IFI44L, MX1, IFI44, USP18, and SAMD9L were
commonly overexpressed among the genes associated
with both interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma
(Supplementary Table  2). Genes associated with NF-κB
and the STAT3 and 5 signaling pathways were also
overexpressed (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table 2).
Specifically, of the genes regulated by NF-κB in response
to TNF-α, CXCL10, CD69, IL7R, EDN1, NFIL3, TAP1,
TNFAIP2, JUN, PLK2, DRAM1, CFLAR, AREG, PLAU,
DUSP5, DUSP1, KLF2, SIK1 and B4GALT5 were
overexpressed (Supplementary Table 2). Not only were
STATs 1, 2 and 4 overexpressed, but genes associated
with the STAT3 and 5 signaling pathways were also
overexprssed, which suggested that these STAT signaling
pathways were activated (Figure 4A and Supplementary
Table 2). Interestingly, IRF4, PRDM1 and PRKCB
expression levels increased, and BCL6, MYC, EGR1 and
NR4A3 expression decreased in CHOP-treated cells. These
genes are part of the discriminators that distinguished the
fatal or refractory DLBCL from the cured DLBCL [35].
Of note, IL10 mRNA increased more than 2-fold following

CHOP treatment. Because IL10 forms an autocrine feedforward loop with LMP1, we tested whether the CHOP
treatment increases IL10 secretion and LMP1 levels. We
treated Farage cells with CHOP and performed an ELISA
and western blot. IL10 secretion was indeed increased
in a dose-dependent manner, and LMP1 levels were also
proportionally increased (Figure 4C and 4D). The levels
of pSTAT3 were also increased after CHOP treatment,
in agreement with our gene set analysis described above
(Figure 4D).

IL4 protects Farage cells from CHOP-induced
cell death
IL4 can enhance B cell survival and proliferation
[36]. In our previous gene expression study we observed
overexpression of downstream target genes of IL4 in
EBV+ DLBCL [4]. CCL22, which is overexpressed
in SLAMF1high and CHOP-treated cells, recruits IL4secreting Th2 cells [28]. Furthermore, IL4 stimulates
LMP1 expression through STAT6 [21]. Therefore, it
is possible that in a tumor microenvironment IL4 will

genes (DEGs) between the SLAMF1high and SLAMF1low Farage cells. Genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle were enriched among the
overexpressed genes in the SLAMF1high Farage cells. (B) The top DEGs. CCL22 was overexpressed by 9-fold in the SLAMF1high Farage

render cancer cells more resistant to CHOP treatment. To
address this hypothesis, we first examined whether the
addition of IL4 to culture medium affects the expression
levels of SLAMF1 at the cell surface by FACS analysis.
We treated Farage cells with IL4, IL13 and IL10 for 24 h
before FACS analysis. IL4 and IL10 treatment increased
SLAMF1 levels in Farage cells, but IL13 did not (Figure
5A). We next tested whether IL4 confers CHOP resistance
to Farage cells. We treated Farage cells with CHOP or
CHOP plus IL4 for 3 days. The combination of CHOP/
IL4 significantly increased the IC50 compared with
CHOP alone (Figure 5B, p-value < 0.0009). Addition
of a lower IL4 concentration achieved a similar result
(Supplementary Figure 2). IL4 suppressed apoptosis
triggered by CHOP treatment (Figure 5C) and arrested the
cell cycle at the G2/M phase (Figure 5D).
To investigate the underlying mechanism of
the anti-apoptotic effect of IL4, we performed gene
expression analysis and western blots. Of the genes
associated with the IL4 pathway, AICDA, BCL2L1,
CCL17, LTA and PDCD1LG2 were increased in the
IL4+CHOP-treated cells as compared with the CHOPtreated cells (Supplementary Figure 3). The expression
of BCL6, IL10, CD79A, SHC1, MYC and EGR1 were
decreased (Supplementary Figure 3) in the IL4+CHOPtreated cells. We next performed western blot analysis
for LMP1, phospho-STATs, pNF-κB (p65), TP53, c-Myc,
BCL6 and anti-apoptotic proteins after 1 day of exposure
to CHOP (1  μM) plus IL4 (50 ng/ml). Phosphorylated
STAT3, STAT6, NF-κB and LMP1 were clearly increased
in the IL4-treated cells (Figure 6A). In particular,
LMP1 and pSTAT3 were greatly increased by IL4.
Increase of TP53 was associated with CHOP treatment
(Figure 6A), which indicated activation of the DNA
damage signaling pathways. Of the three anti-apoptotic
genes BCL2, MCL1 and BCL-XL, MCL1 and BCL-XL
exhibited increased protein levels in agreement with the
gene expression results (Figure 6A and Supplementary
Figure 3). Expression levels of BCL2 appeared to be
inversely correlated with those of the other anti-apoptotic
genes. The BCL6 and c-Myc proteins were decreased
(Figure 6A), which was indicated in the gene expression
data. We confirmed the decrease in BCL6 at the single-cell
level using FACS analysis (Figure 6B). The number of
cells expressing BCL6 were decreased following CHOP
treatment and further decreased following CHOP+IL4
treatment. LMP1 is known to be transactivated by host
STAT3 or 6 as well as viral EBNA2 [21–22]. This
finding suggests that EBNA2 might contribute to the
great increase of LMP1 after IL4 treatment. Therefore,
we examined whether CHOP or IL4 treatment exerted
effects on EBNA2 expression using western blotting.
EBNA2 was hardly expressed in the Farage cells and not
further increased by either IL4 and CHOP or CHOP alone
(Supplementary Figure 4), which lowers the potential
dependency of LMP1 expression on EBNA2 in Farage
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells. As a result, the significant increase in LMP1, pNF-κB
(p65) and pSTAT3 following IL4 treatment might confer a
CHOP-resistant molecular phenotype.

Farage cells are sensitive to NF-κB and STAT
inhibitors
The anthracycline-based CHOP is designed to trigger
cell death by inducing DNA damage, but not by targeting
the NF-κB or JAK/STAT signaling pathways. We therefore
tested the sensitivity of Farage cells to drugs that target the
NF-κB or JAK/STAT signaling pathways. We treated the
Farage cells with the proteasome inhibitor Velcade (also
known as bortezomib), which inhibits NF-κB activity
[37], the AP1/NF-κB double inhibitor SP100030, the
IRF4 TNF-α secretion inhibitor lenalidomide, the JAK1/2
inhibitor ruxolitinib, and STAT3, 5, and 6 inhibitors (SH4-54, pimozide, and AS1517499, respectively). The Farage
cells were most sensitive to Velcade, followed by the STAT6
and 5 inhibitors (Figure 7A). The IC50 values of Velcade
and AS1517499 were 0.002 and 0.22 µM, respectively.
The high sensitivity of the Farage cells to Velcade
reflects their high dependency on constitutive NF-κB
activation for cell survival, which was demonstrated in
EBV+ B cells with type III latency [37]. Direct inhibition
of STATs appeared to be more effective than JAK1/JAK2
inhibition in the Farage cells.
We next investigated whether these NF-κB and
STAT inhibitors perturb the regulatory loop of LMP1
and whether this eventually leads to decreased LMP1
levels. We treated Farage cells with SH-4-54 and
SP100030 alone or in combination (Figure 7B). Three
hours after treatment, SH-4-54 and SP100030 clearly
inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB at 1
or 2.5 μM, respectively (Figure 7B). LMP1 levels were
decreased similarly to the levels of pSTAT3 or pNF-κB
p65 (Figure 7B). SLAMF1 at the cell surface was also
decreased when LMP1 was nearly depleted (Figure 7B
and 7C). A combination of SH-4-54 with SP100030 further
decreased pSTAT3 and LMP1 levels (Figure 7D). Similar
results were observed in combination with AS1517499 and
SP100030 (Figure 7D). Inhibition of pSTAT3 and pNF-κB
p65 was correlated with the number of apoptotic Farage
cells (Figure 7E). Collectively, our results suggest that the
combination of NF-κB and STAT inhibitors is effective for
inducing cell death in EBV+ DLBCL cells.

DISCUSSION
LMP1 is a suggested driver of lymphomagenesis [9]
and can activate multiple pathways, including the NF-κB
signaling pathways that regulate cell survival [17–18]. We
assumed that differential drug responses at the single-cell
level may be responsible for the varying levels of LMP1.
To indirectly isolate LMP1-positive live cells we used
a FITC-conjugated anti-SLAMF1 antibody. We found

that the expression level of LMP1 correlated well with
that of SLAMF1 (Figure 1), and the SLAMF1high Farage
cells reflected the cellular and molecular characteristics
of LMP1high cells (Figures 1 and 2). The SLAMF1high
Farage cells were also enriched by CHOP or IL4
treatments. SLAMF1 is induced in activated normal B
and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages as
well as EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)
[33, 38] and latency type III tumor cells [34]. However,
the increase of SLAMF1high cells by CHOP seemed to
be unique to the tumor cells (Figure 3F). Expression
of SLAMF1 is regulated by LMP1 through the NF-κB
pathways [34]. However, the role of SLAMF1 as a
downstream target of LMP1 remains unknown. We did not
test diverse cell lines, but SLAMF1 appears to be a useful
cell surface marker for the isolation of LMP1high cells.
Patients with EBV+ or EBV- DLBCL have received
a similar combination chemotherapy called CHOP or

R-CHOP (rituximab combined with CHOP). However,
EBV+ cases have a worse prognosis than EBV-negative
cases [1–2, 5–8]. This result suggests that EBV infectiondriven genetic or epigenetic alterations render tumor cells
more resistant to the same chemotherapy. Gene expression
profiles revealed that the activation of the NF-κB and/
or JAK/STAT3 pathways are characteristics of EBV+
DLBCL, even when compared with ABC type EBVDLBCL [4, 10]. Given that constitutive NF-κB and STAT3
activation obstructs with apoptotic effect of chemotherapy,
activation of these pathways may be responsible for the
poor outcomes observed after CHOP treatment in EBV+
DLBCL.
Indeed, cells that survived after CHOP treatment
overexpressed genes regulated by NF-κB (Supplementary
Table 2), suggesting activation of this pathway. However,
this result was not fully supported by western blot.
Phosphorylated NF-κB p65 or p100 were not significantly

increased by a 24-hr exposure to CHOP, although
LMP1 levels clearly increased (Figure 6A). About
2-fold increases in the phosphorylated NF-κB p65 and
p100 were observed only after a substantial increase in
LMP1 following the addition of IL4 (Figure 6A). This
finding indicated that negative regulators of NF-κB may
be activated to maintain a sustained level of activated
NF-κB. Of the known negative regulators of NF-κB,
USP18 and TNFAIP3 (A20) were overexpressed in
CHOP-treated cells 3.8-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively.
Recently, USP18 was identified as a negative regulator
of NF-κB signaling by targeting TAK1 and NEMO for
deubiquitination [39]. Overexpression of the chemokines
CCL17 and CCL22 is an important signature of LMP1mediated NF-κB activation, which has been demonstrated
both in vitro and in vivo [28, 40]. CCL22 was always
overexpressed in the SLAMF1high Farage cells, whereas

CCL17 was highly overexpressed in the presence of IL4
(Supplementary Figure 3), indicating that transactivation
of CCL17 may require higher levels of NF-κB or coactivators associated with IL4. We suggest that the higher
constitutive NF-κB activity in the LMP1+SLAMF1high
Farage cells confers higher resistance to CHOP.	
LMP1 expression is induced by cytokines, such
as IL10, IL-15, INF-γ, IL-13, and IL4 [21–22, 41],
because its promoter contains STAT binding sites. Here,
we observed that IL4 up-regulated STAT3, STAT6, and
LMP1 in Farage cells (Figure 6A), which rendered the
Farage cells resistant to CHOP. IL4 regulates lymphocyte
differentiation, proliferation, and survival through the JAK/
STAT6 or STAT3 and IRS-1/IRS-2/AKT pathways [36].
Lu et al. reported that DLBCL cells respond differently
to IL4 according to the cell of origin [42]. Expression
of IL4-inducible genes such as BCL6 was significantly

kit. (D) The Farage cells were treated with the indicated doses of CHOP followed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting.

higher in GCB-like DLBCL cells than in ABC-like
DLBCL cells [42]. The opposite effects of IL4 on cell
proliferation were observed according to the cell of origin.
IL4 stimulated the proliferation of GCB-like DLBCL cells,
but inhibited the proliferation of ABC-like DLBCL cells
[42]. Similarly, EBV+ DLBCL may respond differently
to IL4 than EBV- DLBCL because of the up-regulation
of LMP1 by IL4, which we observed in the Farage cells.
IL4 stimulated the proliferation of the Farage cells, but
the Farage cells were ostensibly arrested in the G2/M
phase by CHOP plus IL4 treatment (Figure 5). In Farage
cells, BCL6 is highly expressed and was found to be quite
stable against degradation because of the homozygous
deletion of FBXO11 that controls the ubiquitination
and degradation of BCL6 [43]. However, BCL6 levels
were decreased after CHOP or IL4 treatment and further
decreased by both CHOP and IL4 treatment in the Farage

cells (Supplementary Figure 3 and Figure 6A and 6B). In
contrast, IRF4 and PRDM1 or XBP1 were up-regulated by
CHOP or/and IL4 in conjunction with NF-κB activation.
Considering that NF-κB-mediated IRF4 induction
downregulated BCL6 expression [44], the increased IRF4,
possibly caused by IL4/STAT6 or STAT3/LMP1/NF-κB
signaling, may lead to down-regulation of BCL6, resulting
in the activation of the molecular program of post-germinal
plasmablast cells. The surviving Farage cells after the
CHOP+IL4 treatment appeared to be ABC-like DLBCL
cells. Collectively, our data suggest that the presence of IL4
in the tumor microenvironment of EBV+ DLBCL may alter
the outcome of CHOP treatment towards a poor prognosis.
In conclusion, higher activation of the NF-κB and
JAK/STAT signaling pathways is a feature of EBV+
DLBCL and CHOP-resistant Farage cells. NF-κB and
STAT inhibitors suppressed the viral oncogene LMP1

Figure 5: Exogenous IL4 conferred increased resistance to CHOP in Farage cells. (A) The cytokines IL4 (50 ng/mL) or IL10
(50 ng/mL) increased SLAMF1 levels in the Farage cells. (B) The addition of IL4 made the Farage cells more resistant to CHOP. (C) IL4
inhibited apoptosis triggered by CHOP. The Farage cells were treated with 0.1 or 1 μg/mL CHOP alone or in combination with IL4 (50 ng/mL).
(D) The addition of IL4 to CHOP arrested the Farage cells in the G2/M phase.

and cell survival. Therefore, a new combination therapy
that includes NF-κB and STAT inhibitors may be more
successful at eliminating EBV+ DLBCL cells.

Farage cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 107 cells
in a T75 flask and cultured for 2 days. The cells were then
washed, their Fc receptors were blocked, and SLAMF1 was
labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-human SLAMF1/CD150
antibody (Cat# 306306, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA).
The labeled cells were analyzed by a Becton-Dickinson
FACS Aria III (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the top
10% most brightly labeled, moderately labeled, and bottom
10% dimly labeled cells were selected and designated as
SLAMF1high, SLAMF1inter, and SLAMF1low, respectively.
Subsequent analyses were performed as described below.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Jijoye, IM-9, Daudi, and lymphoblastoid cell lines
were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB)
(Seoul, South Korea) and Raji and Farage cell lines from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). All cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and
antibiotics (100 μg/mL penicillin and streptomycin). All
cells were grown in an incubator at 37˚C under a 5% CO2
humidified atmosphere.

Cell proliferation and viability test
Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells in
96-well plates for the cell proliferation and viability tests.

Figure 6: A large increase in LMP1 caused by IL4 suppressed CHOP-induced cell death. (A) Farage cells were treated with

1 μg/mL CHOP alone or in combination with IL4 (50 ng/mL) or an anti-SLAMF1 antibody (500 ng/mL) for 2 days. The drug-treated cells
were lysed, which was followed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The following antibodies were used: anti-SLAMF1, phospho-STAT3
(Tyr705), phospho-STAT6 (Tyr641), phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536), PARP, BCL-XL, MCL1, BCL6, Bcl-2, LMP1, TP53, and GAPDH.
(B) Farage cells were treated with 0.1 or 1 μg/mL CHOP alone or in combination with IL4 (50 ng/mL). The drug-treated Farage cells were
washed and incubated with an Fc blocker. To stain IRF4 and BCL6, the cells were fixed and permeabilized. Flow cytometry was then
performed after incubating the cells with PE-conjugated anti-IRF4 or APC-conjugated anti-BCL6.

In the drug treatment conditions, drugs were added 1 day
following seeding, and the cells were cultured for 3 days.
Cell proliferation and viability were measured using the
WST-1 reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocols
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Optical density was measured
at 450 and 600 nm 4 hr after adding the WST-1 reagent.
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was
calculated with GraphPad software (La Jolla, CA, USA).

a Becton-Dickinson FACS Calibur flow cytometer.
Data were analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton
Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).

Drug inhibition experiments
CHOP consisted of four drugs (cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, adriamycin, and prednisone) in a ratio of
80/5.5/0.16/11.1, respectively [45]. All four drugs were
purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA).
Farage cells were treated with various concentrations of
CHOP for 2 days or 3 days. Other drugs and their sources
were as follows: Velcade (Selleckchem), ruxolitinib
(Axon Medchem, Groningen, Netherlands), lenalidomide
(Axon Medchem), SP 100030 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol,
United Kingdom), pimozide (Calbiochem, Darmstadt,
Germany), AS 1517499 (Axon Medchem) and SH-4-54

Cell cycle analysis
FACS-sorted and drug-treated cells were washed
with cold 1 × PBS and then fixed with 70% cold ethanol
for more than 30 min at –20°C. Cells were washed with
1 × PBS and incubated with a staining solution including
50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 200 μg/ml RNase
A for 15 min at 37°C. DNA content was analyzed using

Figure 7: Inhibition of the NF-κB and STAT pathways. (A) Farage cells were treated with various concentrations of lenalidomide,
Velcade, ruxolitinib, SP 100030, SH-4-54, pimozide, and AS 1517499. Cell viability was measured using the WST-1 reagent and the
determination of IC50 values and generation of the graphs were performed using GraphPad software. The IC50 values of Velcade and AS
1517499 were 0.0015 and 0.22 μM, respectively. (B) Farage cells were treated with 0.1, 1, or 5 μM SH-4-54 (left panel) or 0.1, 1, 2.5,
or 5 μM SP 100030 (right panel) for 3 h. The cells were lysed followed by western blotting with anti-LMP1, pSTAT3, and pNF-κB p65
(Ser536) antibodies. (C) Farage cells were treated with 0, 1, or 5 μM SH-4-54 for 3 h. The cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated control
IgG or anti-SLAMF1 antibodies and were subjected to FACS analysis. (D) Farage cells were treated with 0.1 μg/mL CHOP, 1 or 5 μM
SH-4-54 (SH), 2.5 μM SP 100030 (SP), 1 μM AS 1517499 (AS), and combinations as indicated for 3 h. The cells were lysed followed by
western blotting with anti-LMP1 and pSTAT3 antibodies. (E) Inhibition of pSTAT3 triggered early apoptosis in Farage cells. Farage cells
were treated with 0.1 μg/mL CHOP, 1 or 5 μM SH-4-54 (SH), and 2.5 μM SP 100030 (SP) alone and in combination for 3 h. Annexin
V-positive labeling (lower right) indicates cells undergoing early apoptosis.

purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly,
MA); and LMP1 (CS1-4, M0897) from Dako (Glostrup,
Denmark); TP53 (sc-126), GAPDH (sc-25778), and goat
anti-rabbit IgG (sc-3837) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA); we developed an anti-SLAMF1
rabbit polyclonal antibody for western blotting.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
for IL10 and CCL22
To detect secreted CCL22, Farage cells were sorted
into three groups (SLAMF1high, SLAMF1inter, SLAMF1low)
as described above. We then seeded the sorted cells into
96-well plates and cultured them for 24 hr and used the
culture media for ELISA. We performed ELISA (ELISA
MAX™ Deluxe Set) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To
detect secreted IL10 after CHOP treatment, Farage cells
were seeded at 1 × 106 cells in a T25 flask. The next day,
the cells were treated with various concentrations of
CHOP for 24 hr. The CHOP-treated cells were seeded
at 5 × 104–1 × 105 cells and incubated for 24 hr without
CHOP. The culture medium was removed, and ELISA was
performed by using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems). Cell
numbers were normalized by the cell viability test.

Flow cytometry for the detection of transcription
factors
For staining cell surface markers, 1 × 106 cells were
washed in 1 × PBS buffer and resuspended in 100 μl
FACS buffer. To block the Fc receptor, 5 μl of TruStain
(Biolegend) was added and incubated on ice for 15 min.
The cells were then washed and resuspended in 100 μl
FACS buffer. FITC-conjugated anti-CD10 or SLAMF1
was added (2.5–5 μl) and incubated at room temperature
for 30 min. For staining IRF4 and BCL6, we followed the
methods described by Albu et al. [46]. Briefly, the cells
were washed and incubated with an Fc blocker. The cells
were then fixed with fixation buffer (3% formaldehyde,
0.1% saponin in PBS) and permeabilized with
permeabilization buffer (1% FBS, 0.5% saponin, 10 μg/ml
RNase A in PBS) before incubation with PE-conjugated
anti-IRF4 (646403) or APC-conjugated anti-BCL6
(358505). Isotype control APC mouse IgG2b (400319)
and PE mouse IgG2a (400213) served as controls.
All antibodies were purchased from Biolegend. Flow
cytometry was performed on a FACS Calibur, and data
were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Analysis of apoptosis
Drug-treated Farage cells were stained with Annexin
V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (BD Biosciences,
Heidelberg, Germany) and propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Detection of early apoptotic (Annexin V-FITC+
and PI-) and late apoptotic cells (Annexin V-FITC+ and
PI+) was performed using a FACS Calibur (Becton and
Dickinson). Data were analyzed with CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson).

Gene expression profiling and data analysis
We generated gene expression profiles from three
different experimental conditions using the Affymetrix
GeneChip HuGene 2.0 ST oligonucleotide arrays
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California). The three experimental
conditions were: 1) comparison of SLAMF1high
and SLAMF1low cells; 2) Farage cells treated with
1 μg/ml CHOP for 2 days and 3 days compared with
untreated Farage cells; 3) Farage cells incubated with 1 μg/ml
CHOP plus 50 ng/ml IL4 compared with 50 ng/ml
IL4 alone for 2 days. Total RNA was extracted from the
harvested cells using an RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Germany)
and were sent to the local Affymetrix GeneChip service
provider (DNA LINK, Seoul, Korea). One hundred nanograms of high quality total RNA was converted to doublestranded cDNA. Subsequent amplification of cRNA,
labeling of probes, and scanning signals were performed
according to the company’s protocol. Gene expression
estimates were normalized using the robust multiarray
averaging (RMA) method. The microarray data followed
the MIAME guidelines and were deposited in the GEO
database (GSE81413). Genes showing an average foldchange greater than 2.0 (p < 0.05, unpaired t-test) between
the SLAMF1high and SLAMF1low cells or between given

Western blot analysis
Farage cells were treated with 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and
1  μg/ml CHOP alone or in combination with 1 μg/ml
CHOP and IL4 (cat# 574002, Biolegend, 50 ng/ml) or
0.1 μg/ml CHOP and various concentration of AS 1517499.
The FACS-sorted and the drug-treated cells were lysed
with M-PER buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL)
containing a 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche). Then, 20–40 μg of lysate was separated
on 4–15% or 12% precast sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
dry milk and incubated with appropriate primary and
secondary antibodies. Signals were detected using the
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Pierce Biotechnology). The following antibodies were
used in this study: phospho-NF-kB p65 (3033), PARP
(9542), BCL-XL (2764), MCL1 (5453), BCL6 (14895),
caspase-3 (9668), Bcl-2 (4223), phospho-STAT3 (9145),
phospho-STAT5 (4322), and phospho-STAT6 (9361) were
