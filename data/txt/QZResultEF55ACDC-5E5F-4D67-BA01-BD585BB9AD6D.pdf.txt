Abstract

Author Manuscript

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common malignancy with a poor prognosis. Despite
progress targeting oncogenic drivers, there are no therapies targeting tumor suppressor loss.
Smad4 is an established tumor suppressor in pancreatic and colon cancer, however, the
consequences of Smad4 loss in lung cancer are largely unknown. We evaluated Smad4 expression
in human NSCLC samples and examined Smad4 alterations in large NSCLC datasets and found
that reduced Smad4 expression is common in human NSCLC and occurs through a variety of
mechanisms including mutation, homozygous deletion, and heterozygous loss. We modeled
Smad4 loss in lung cancer by deleting Smad4 in airway epithelial cells and found that Smad4
deletion both initiates and promotes lung tumor development. Interestingly, both Smad4−/− mouse
tumors and human NSCLC samples with reduced Smad4 expression demonstrated increased DNA
damage while Smad4 knockdown in lung cancer cells reduced DNA repair and increased
apoptosis after DNA damage. In addition, Smad4 deficient NSCLC cells demonstrated increased
sensitivity to both chemotherapeutics that inhibit DNA topoisomerase and drugs that block double
strand DNA break repair by non-homologous end joining. In sum, these studies establish Smad4
as a lung tumor suppressor and suggest that the defective DNA repair phenotype of Smad4
deficient tumors can be exploited by specific therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Although over 175,000 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed annually
in the United States the five-year survival rate remains less than 20% (1). Despite advances
in targeting oncogenic drivers, most NSCLC are not amenable to the currently available
small molecule inhibitors and there is a paucity of approaches targeting tumor suppressor
loss (2). Smad4 mediates signaling of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and bone
morphogenic protein (BMP) ligands (3) and is a well-defined tumor suppressor in pancreatic
and colon cancer (4). Smad4 loss and mutation have also been described in NSCLC (5, 6)
where they are associated with lymph node metastases, increased angiogenesis, and more
aggressive cellular behavior in vitro (7, 8), though other consequences of Smad4 alterations
in lung cancer are unknown.

Author Manuscript

In animal models, Smad4 deletion can initiate tumor formation in keratinized epithelial
layers and can promote the development of tumors initiated by other oncogenic events
(9-16). Smad4 loss increases proliferation secondary to loss of TGFβ-mediated growth
suppression and also increases the proportion of well-differentiated tumors, presumably
because Smad4 loss blocks TGFβ-driven epithelial to mesechymal transition (10, 12, 14,
17). However, essentially nothing is known about whether Smad4 loss initiates or promotes
lung tumor development in vivo or the characteristics of Smad4 deficient lung tumors.

Author Manuscript

TGFβ1 deletion increases genomic instability and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (18, 19),
and we previously reported that Smad4 deletion increases genomic instability in a mouse
model of head and neck cancer (11). These findings suggest that TGFβ signaling may
regulate genomic stability through DNA repair. DNA repair is a complex process that
requires detecting DNA damage and activating appropriate repair pathways (20). Single
strand DNA damage is repaired through a combination of mismatch repair, base excision
repair, and nucleotide excision repair, while double strand breaks (DSB) are repaired by
homologous recombination repair (HRR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (20). DSB
are sensed by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) which then activates HRR (21, 22) and
by Ku family proteins that then activate DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and
repair through NHEJ (23). HRR is more accurate as it relies on homologous sequences while
NHEJ has a lower fidelity and is responsible for the majority of tumorigenic chromosomal
rearrangements (23). In this study we sought to evaluate the role of Smad4 loss in human
lung cancer, to determine whether Smad4 is a lung tumor suppressor, and to assess DNA
repair in Smad4 deficient lung cancer cells, with the ultimate goal of improving treatment
strategies for Smad4 deficient tumors.

RESULTS
Reduced Smad4 expression is common in human NSCLC
Smad4 loss through a combination of mutation and homozygous deletion has been reported
in 4-6% of NSCLC (24, 25). However, other molecular events can also reduce Smad4
expression as the frequency of reduced Smad4 immunostaining far exceeds that of Smad4
mutation in most aerodigestive cancers (4). We found reduced Smad4 immunostaining in
58% (98/168) of human NSCLC samples (Fig. 1A) and observed that reduced Smad4

immunostaining was associated with reduced Smad4 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B),
suggesting that Smad4 down-regulation occurs pre-translationally. Consistent with data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (25), we did not detect Smad4 promoter methylation by
pyrosequencing (data not shown). When we assessed Smad4 copy number in NSCLC
samples and paired non-malignant lung by qPCR of genomic DNA, we observed reduced
Smad4 copy number in 9% (9/95) of samples (Fig. 1C) and all samples with Smad4 copy
loss demonstrated reduced Smad4 immunostaining (Fig. 1D). In our dataset, we did not
detect associations between reduced Smad4 immunostaining, mRNA expression, or copy
loss and clinical or pathologic variables (data not shown). We also examined the frequency
of Smad4 alterations in publically available NSCLC datasets using the cBioPortal web site
(http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/) and found that while Smad4 mutation or
homozygous deletion were relatively rare, each occurring in <5% of NSCLC, heterozygous
Smad4 loss was seen in 13% of lung squamous cell carcinomas and up to 47% of lung
adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1E).
Smad4 deletion initiates lung tumor formation and increases the size and malignant
conversion of Kras-initiated lung tumors

Author Manuscript

Because it was unknown whether Smad4 functions as a lung tumor suppressor, we created
several novel NSCLC mouse models to directly evaluate the role of Smad4 loss in lung
tumorigenesis. First, we induced Smad4 deletion in airway basal cells using either the
K5CrePR* or K14CrePR transgene (26, 27). Both constructs use a keratin promoter to direct
expression of an RU486-inducible Cre recombinase-progesterone receptor (CrePR) fusion
protein; recombination is limited to the lung by tracheal RU486 instillation (28). This
strategy induced tumor formation in 48% (11/23) animals (Fig. 2A, Smad4−/−). These
animals typically had a single large adenoma or adenocarcinoma (not shown) that occurred
between 12-18 months of age.

Author Manuscript

Since Kras mutations are common in human lung cancer and can occur in conjunction with
both Smad4 mutation and copy loss (24, 25), we also assessed the effect of Smad4 deletion
on KrasG12D-initiated lung tumor formation. Similar to what we previously observed
{Malkoski, 2012 #1553}, KrasG12D activation directed by K5CrePR* induced lung tumor
formation in 48% (16/33) animals. To confirm Smad4 deletion we extracted DNA from
tumor and grossly normal lung and detected the recombinant Smad4 allele only in tumors
(Supplemental Fig. 1), we also confirmed that tumors with Smad4 deletion also had reduced
Smad4 immunostaining (Fig. 2E, bottom panel). Although Smad4 deletion did not
significantly increase tumor incidence or multiplicity (Fig. 2A), it almost doubled KrasG12D
initiated tumor size (Fig. 2B). An increase in tumor size was also seen when a single Smad4
allele was deleted (Fig. 2B) consistent with Smad4 haploinsufficiency promoting tumor
growth. We also observed that Kras.Smad4−/− tumors had ~20% fewer cells per mm2 than
Kras tumors, suggesting that these tumors have larger individual cell size (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, deletion of either one or both Smad4 alleles increased malignant conversion as
evidenced by a larger fraction of adenocarcinomas relative to adenomas (Fig. 2D). These
data are consistent with Smad4 functioning as a lung tumor suppressor.

Reduced Smad4 expression is associated with increased DNA damage
Because TGFβ/Smad signaling regulates genomic stability (11, 18), we assessed DNA
damage in our mouse Smad4−/− lung tumors using pH2AX immunostaining to mark DSB.
Compared to Kras tumors, both Kras.Smad4−/− and Smad4−/− tumors demonstrated
increased pH2AX staining (Fig. 3A-B). When we assessed whether human NSCLC, we
found that reduced Smad4 immunostaining was associated with increased DSB (Fig. 3C-E).
These data demonstrate that reduced Smad4 expression is associated with increased DNA
damage in vivo and suggest genomic instability as a potential mechanism for tumor
initiation by Smad4 deletion.
Reduced Smad4 expression reduces DNA repair and increases apoptosis after DNA
damage

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Because Smad4 deficient tumors had increased DNA damage, we hypothesized that Smad4
deficient cells might exhibit reduced DNA repair. We stably knocked down Smad4 in
Beas2B (SV40 T antigen immortalized) airway epithelial cells and purchased A549 lung
adenocarcinoma cells with a zinc finger engineered Smad4 deletion (Sigma). Reduced
Smad4 expression was confirmed at the mRNA and protein level (Supplemental Fig. 2).
Both at baseline and after treatment with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin,
Beas2B cells with Smad4 knockdown exhibited increased DNA damage as measured by the
comet assay (Fig. 4A-B). Although A549 Smad4−/− cells did not exhibit increased DNA
damage at baseline (Fig. 4C), when challenged with etoposide (a DNA topoisomerase II
inhibitor) for 4h and then allowed to recover for 24h, A549 Smad4−/− cells also exhibited
increased DNA damage by comet assay (Fig. 4C). Similarly, A549 Smad4−/− cells also had
increased DNA damage as measured by an increased number of nuclei with large number of
pH2AX foci 12h after an etoposide challenge (Fig. 4D-E), suggesting that Smad4 deficient
cells have a reduced ability to resolve DNA damage.

Author Manuscript

We then tested whether increased DNA damage resulted in increased apoptosis or cell death
in Smad4 deficient cells and found that Beas2B cells with Smad4 knockdown treated with
camptothecin for 4h demonstrated increased apoptosis as measured by Annexin V staining
(Fig. 5A). A549 Smad4−/− cells also exhibited increased apoptosis and cell death after a 4h
treatment with camptothecin or etoposide when assayed either immediately after treatment
or 24h later (Fig. 5B-C, respectively), suggesting that Smad4 deficient cells have increased
apoptosis when faced with a genotoxic challenge. To assess whether apoptotic cells
exhibited DNA damage, we simultaneously stained for both Annexin V to mark apoptotic
cells and pH2AX to mark DSB. In both A549 and A549 Smad4−/− cells, treatment with
camptothecin or etoposide caused a large increase in the percentage of Annexin V positive
cells that also stained positive for pH2AX (Supplemental Fig. 3).
Reduced Smad4 expression increases sensitivity to DNA topoisomerase inhibitors and
inhibitors of NEHJ
Because reduced Smad4 expression increased apoptosis in response to DNA damage, we
hypothesized that cells with low Smad4 expression would be more sensitive to DNA
damaging agents. We performed a series of cell viability assays in Beas2B cells with Smad4
knockdown and A549 Smad4−/− cells and found that reduced Smad4 expression sensitizes

to numerous DSB causing drugs (gemcitabine, camptothecin, etoposide, doxorubicin, Fig.
6A-B). In contrast, reduced Smad4 expression had a more modest effect on sensitivity to
alkylating-like agents (cisplatin) and DNA crosslinkers (mitomycin C), perhaps because the
DNA adducts formed by these agents are predominantly intrastrand crosslinks not DSB (29,
30). H1299 lung cancer cells with Smad4 knockdown also demonstrated increased
sensitivity to both gemcitabine and etoposide in chemosensitivity assays (not shown).
Corroborating these observations, in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (31), low
Smad4 expression correlates with increased sensitivity of NSCLC lines to the camptothecin
derivatives, irinotecan and topotecan (Fig. 6C-D).

Author Manuscript

Since Smad4 deficient cells had defective DNA repair and increased apoptosis after DNA
damage, we tested whether these cells were more sensitive to DNA repair inhibitors using a
long term proliferation assay and found that A549 Smad4−/− cells were more sensitive to
NU7441, a DNA-PK inhibitor (Fig. 7A) and to PI-103 a dual DNA-PK/mTOR inhibitor
(Fig. 7B) while H1299 cells with Smad4 knockdown were more sensitive to PI-103 (Fig.
7C). We also assessed activation of DNA repair pathways after DNA damage and found that
A549 Smad4−/− cells demonstrated reduced activation of both pDNA-PK and pATM after
etoposide treatment (Fig. 8).

DISCUSSION
Reduced Smad4 expression is common in human NSCLC

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Reduced Smad4 expression was seen in 58% of our NSCLC samples (Fig. 1A) and is likely
a result of a combination of mutation, homozygous deletion, and heterozygous loss. Our
data are relatively consistent with genome-wide datasets demonstrating Smad4 alterations in
18-51% of NSCLC (Fig. 1E). Although TCGA data demonstrate heterozygous Smad4 loss
in 13% of lung squamous cell carcinomas and 47% of lung adenocarcinomas (24, 25), we
detected Smad4 copy loss in only 9% of NSCLC. This difference is likely related to our
conservative criteria for determining Smad4 copy loss with the CopyCaller v1.0 software:
with less stringent criteria, we likely would have identified many more samples as having
heterozygous Smad4 loss. Although Smad4 mutations have been previously associated with
lymph node metastases, increased angiogenesis, and more aggressive cellular behavior in
vitro (7, 8), we did not observe associations between reduced Smad4 expression and clinical
or pathologic parameters. Reasons for the discrepancy between our data and a previous
report (8) are not entirely clear. It could be that Smad4 loss is an early or tumor initiating
event and is not associated with more aggressive tumor behavior, however, even in
pancreatic and colon cancer where Smad4 loss has been better characterized, relationships
between Smad4 loss and more aggressive tumor behavior have not been consistently
observed (4).
Targeting Smad4 deletion to airway basal cells initiates and promotes lung tumor
formation
One of our most significant findings is that Smad4 deletion both initiates spontaneous lung
tumor formation and promotes the growth of Kras-initiated lung tumors. In other models,
Smad4 deletion promotes tumor development initiated by Kras activation or PTEN deletion

(10-16), however Smad4-initiated tumor formation has been previously described only in
keratinized epithelial layers (9-11, 17). In our model, targeting Smad4 deletion (with or
without Kras activation) to keratin positive airway basal cells produced predominantly
adenomas and adenocarcinomas and ~5% squamous cell carcinomas (not shown). This is
consistent with our previous experience targeting oncogenic alterations to basal cells via a
keratin promoter (32, 33) and demonstrates that airway basal cells can give rise to multiple
tumor types in the same way that they can differentiate into multiple airway epithelial cell
types (34-36). We also observed that deletion of a single Smad4 allele increased both tumor
size and malignant conversion (Fig. 2), consistent with the Smad4 haploinsufficiency seen in
other models (10, 11). Importantly, this suggests that the heterozygous Smad4 loss seen
commonly in human NSCLC likely promotes tumor growth.
Smad4 loss increases DNA damage and reduces DNA repair

Author Manuscript

Smad4−/− murine lung tumors and human NSCLC with reduced Smad4 expression
demonstrate increased DNA damage (Fig. 3) and Smad4 deficient cells have reduced DNA
repair and reduced activation of DNA repair pathways after DNA damage (Figs. 4 and 8).
Genomic instability provides a potential mechanism for tumor initiation by Smad4 deletion
and was observed in our previous model where Smad4 deletion initiated tumor formation but
was not seen in another model where Smad4 deletion did not initiate tumor formation (11,
12). It is possible that reduced DNA repair in Smad4 deficient cells facilitates the
accumulation of oncogenic mutations in vivo leading to tumor initiation after Smad4 loss.
The phenotype of Smad4 deficient cells reveals potential therapeutic strategies

Author Manuscript

Our study demonstrates that Smad4 cells are more sensitive to certain DNA damaging
agents, specifically the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, suggesting that Smad4 deficient
tumors may be preferentially susceptible to similar treatments. Our observation that Smad4
knockdown sensitizes to DSB causing drugs contrasts with previous reports demonstrating
that Smad4 knockdown in colon or breast cancer cells decreases sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) (37, 38). This is likely related to the repair of 5-FU related lesions by single strand
DNA repair pathways {Wyatt, 2009 #1457} and the repair of gemcitabine, etoposide, and
camptothecin related DNA damage by DSB repair pathways (39-43). Smad4 deficient cells
have reduced activation of both pDNA-PK and pATM after DNA damage by etoposide (Fig.
8). Because there is substantial cross talk between DSB repair by NHEJ and HRR (44, 45),
additional studies will be required to mechanistically define the precise double strand DNA
repair defects present in Smad4 deficeint cells.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our study suggests that reduced Smad4 expression produces a potentially
targetable tumor phenotype: one that will be more sensitive to treatment with DNA
topoisomerase inhibitors and specific DNA repair inhibitors. It remains to be determined
whether reduced Smad4 expression or Smad4 mutation correlates with increased
responsiveness to the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors in human cancers. This would be
highly relevant since most chemotherapy regimens for malignancies that frequently have
Smad4 loss (NSCLC, head and neck cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer) often do not
include the agents to which Smad4 deficient cells are most sensitive. In addition, our
findings pave the way for future studies using reduced Smad4 expression as a biomarker for

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of human NSCLC samples

Author Manuscript

All studies were IRB approved. Human samples were obtained from three sources: the
Oregon Health & Sciences University Department of Pathology Tumor Bank (n=37), the
Colorado Lung SPORE Tissue Bank (n=87), and a commercially available tissue microarray
(n=64, T8235724, lot A606098, Biochain, Hayward, CA). Clinical and pathologic data were
extracted from the medical record or provided with the tissue array. Survival data was
obtained by searching the social security death index database. Complete pathologic and
demographic data is shown in Supplemental Table 1. Immunostaining for Smad4 (1:100
#7154 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was performed as previously described
(32). Staining intensity was graded as preserved or reduced by two independent observers
(SPM and SMH) and differences in immunostaining frequency between groups analyzed by
chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. RT-qPCR with a Smad4 probe (Hs00232068, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was performed and analyzed by non-parametric methods
(as previously described (32). Smad4 copy number at exons 5 and 10 was assessed in tumor
and matched normal lung DNA samples with Smad4 Copy Number Assays Hs01715545 and
Hs02847956, an internal RNase P control and CopyCaller v1.0 software (Life Technologies)
per the manufacture's recommendations (ΔCt<0.15, z<1.75). Double strand DNA breaks
were analyzed by immunostaining for pH2AX (1:100 #9718, Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA), quantified as the percent pH2AX positive nuclei, and differences compared
with an unpaired t test.

Generation and analysis of NSCLC mouse model

Author Manuscript

All animal studies were IACUC approved. The Smad4 conditional knockout allele, lox-stoplox-KrasG12D conditional knock-in allele, and K5Cre*PR transgene, and K14CrePR
transgene have been previously described (26, 27, 46-48). Lung tumors were initiated with
500μg tracheal RU486 at 4-6 weeks of age. Mice were euthanized between 12-18 months of
age or if they lost >15% of their body weight; tumors were measured, enumerated, collected,
then classified according to consensus criteria (49). PCR for recombinant Kras and Smad4
alleles was performed as previously described (50, 51). Smad4 and pH2AX immunostaining
was performed as described above. Tumor cell size was analyzed by counting the number of
cells in a 40X field from H&E stained sections from at least 5 animals of each genotype. All
images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with Nikon Elements Software
and analyzed with ImageJ (rsbweb.nih.gov). Differences between groups were compared
with by one-way ANOVA, unpaired t test, or Fisher's exact test as appropriate.
Generation and validation of cell lines
Beas2B (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in BEGM (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). A549
cells and A549 cells with Smad4 deletion (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were grown in
F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 2mM L-glutamine. H1299 cells (ATCC) were grown
in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Cell lines with stable Smad4 knockdown were

the pcPUR+U6 cassette (iGene Therapeutics, Tokyo, Japan) was used as a control. Reduced
Smad4 expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blot against Smad4 (1:200

Comet assay

Author Manuscript

Beas2B cells (125,000) and A549 cells (100,000) were plated into 12 well plates and
allowed to attach overnight. Beas2B cells were treated with camptothecin (5μM for 24h);
A549 cells were treated with etoposide (100μM for 4h, assayed 24h later). Cells were
washed with PBS and removed from the plates by trypsinization, then 15,000 cells in 15μL
PBS were combined with 85μl of agarose; 75μL of this mixture was placed in each well of
the OxiSelect Comet Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA). Cells were then subject to
alkaline electrophoresis per the manufacturer's instructions. Images were acquired on Nikon
Eclipse 80i microscope and analyzed using CaspLab Comet Assay Software (http://
casplab.com). Differences between groups were compared by unpaired t test.
pH2AX immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

A549 Smad4−/− cells (7500/well) were plated into glass chamber slides (BD Biosciences)
and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were treated with etoposide (25μM for 4h) then
harvested at various time points post treatment. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (15min at room temperature), washed with PBS, permeabilized with
100% ice-cold methanol, then washed again with PBS. After blocking (5% normal goat
serum/1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100 for 1h at room temperature) cells were stained overnight
at 4°C with pH2AX antibody (1:400, Cell Signaling, in 5% NGS/1% BSA), rinsed with
PBS-T then incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500, Life Technologies) for 1h at
room temperature. Cells were then rinsed with PBS-T and mounted using DAPI
Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). pH2AX immunostaining was
quantified by counting at least 100 nuclei per treatment condition; differences were
compared by Chi-squared test.
Annexin V flow cytometry

Beas2B cells with Smad4 knockdown were treated with 10μM camptothecin for 4h then
harvested with TrypLE (Life Technologies) and assayed with the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit
(Life Technologies) per the manufacturer's instructions using a FC500 flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A549 Smad4−/− cells were treated with camptothecin or
etoposide, were harvested with TrypLE (Life Technologies) then washed with cold PBS.
Cells were assayed with the Fixable Viability Dye eFluor®506, Annexin V PE Apoptosis
Detection Kit, and Anti-Human/mouse pH2AX (Ser139) PerCP-eFluor® 710 (all from
eBioscience) per the manufacturer's protocol (http://media.ebioscience.com/data/pdf/bestprotocols/annexin-v-staining.pdf) using a Gallios flow cytometer.

Figure 1. Reduced Smad4 expression in human NSCLC

(A) Smad4 immunostaining in human NSCLC samples was graded as either preserved
(staining equal to normal airway) or reduced (less than normal airway) by two independent
observers; reduced Smad4 immunostaining was observed in 58% (98/168) of NSCLC.
Multiple examples of preserved and reduced Smad4 immunostaining are shown in Fig. 3CD. (B) Reduced Smad4 immunostaining correlates with reduced Smad4 mRNA expression.
Smad4 expression (normalized to paired non-malignant lung) is expressed as fold reduction
in NSCLC samples with preserved or reduced Smad4 immunostaining. (C) Smad4 copy

Figure 2. Smad4 deletion initiates lung tumor formation and increases size and malignant
conversion of KrasG12D-initiated lung tumors

(A) Tumor incidence, number, and age in mice with the indicated genotypes. Animals were
treated and monitored as described in Methods. Tumors were observed in 48% of animals
with K5CrePR* (n=13) or K14CrePR (n=10) directed Smad4 deletion (hereafter referred to
as Smad4−/− animals). Tumors were seen in 48% of K5CrePR*.LSL-KrasG12D mice, 41%
of K5CrePR*.LSL-KrasG12D.Smad4fl/+ mice, and 68% of K5CrePR*.LSLKrasG12D.Smad4fl/fl mice (hereafter referred to as Kras, Kras.Smad4+/−, and Kras.Smad4−/
−, respectively). Smad4−/− animals exhibited fewer tumors compared to Kras animals

(p=0.05), however the increased tumor number seen in Kras.Smad4+/− and Kras.Smad4−/−
animals (compared to Kras animals) did not reach statistical significance. (B) Deletion of
one or both Smad4 alleles increased the size of Kras initiated lung tumors (*p<0.05 vs
Kras). Smad4−/− tumors were also larger than Kras tumors (*p<0.05 vs Kras). (C) Smad4
deletion increased the average cell size of Kras initiated tumors as demonstrated by fewer
cells per mm2. (D) Smad4 deletion promotes malignant conversion of Kras-initiated lung
tumors as evidenced by the larger proportion of adenocarcinomas with deletion of one or
two copies of Smad4 (p=0.0022 for trend). (E) An example of a Kras adenoma and a
Kras.Smad4−/− adenocarcinoma (top) and an example of reduced Smad4 immunostaining in

(A-B) Drug sensitivity was assessed in Beas2B immortalized airway epithelial cells with
stable Smad4 knock down and A549 Smad4−/− cells using a cell viability assay. Data are
expressed as the average fold decrease in EC50 (Smad4 deficient to control). All drugs were
tested in at least two independent experiments. H1299 lung cancer cells with Smad4
knockdown also demonstrated increased sensitivity to gemcitabine and etoposide (data not
shown). (C-D) Reduced Smad4 expression correlates with increased sensitivity (activity
area) to camptothecin derivatives NSCLC cell lines in the CCLE. Although the association
of reduced Smad4 expression and activity area was modest, it was confirmed by analysis of
residuals.

Figure 7. Reduced Smad4 expression increases sensitivity to DNA-PK inhibitors

(A) A549 Smad4−/− cells were grown in NU7441 at the indicated concentrations for 17-23
days then stained with crystal violet. * p=0.05 vs A549. (B) A549 Smad4−/− cells (100/
well) were grown in PI-103 at the indicated concentrations for 12-23 days and then stained
with crystal violet. * p=0.02 vs A549; ** p=0.08 vs A549. (C) H1299 cells with Smad4
knockdown (100/well) were grown in PI-103 at the indicated concentrations for 12-17 days
and then stained with crystal violet; * p=0.07 vs H1299; ** p=0.02 vs H1299. Examples of
long term proliferation assays are shown at right.

Figure 8. Smad4 loss decreases DNA repair activity after DNA damage

A549 Smad4−/− cells were treated with etoposide for the indicated times then protein
harvested for analysis. A549 Smad4−/− cells demonstrate reducted pDNA-PK and pATM
after exposure to etoposide. Experiments were repeated at least twice.
