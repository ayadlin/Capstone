ABSTRACT
LINC00472 is a novel long intergenic non-coding RNA. We evaluated LINC00472
expression in breast tumor samples using RT-qPCR, performed a meta-analysis of
over 20 microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database,
and investigated the effect of LINC00472 expression on cell proliferation and
migration in breast cancer cells transfected with a LINC00472-expressing vector.
Our qPCR results showed that high LINC00472 expression was associated with less
aggressive breast tumors and more favorable disease outcomes. Patients with high
expression of LINC00472 had significantly reduced risk of relapse and death compared
to those with low expression. Patients with high LINC00472 expression also had
better responses to adjuvant chemo- or hormonal therapy than did patients with low
expression. Results of meta-analysis on multiple studies from the GEO database were
in agreement with the findings of our study. High LINC00472 was also associated
with favorable molecular subtypes, Luminal A or normal-like tumors. Cell culture
experiments showed that up-regulation of LINC00472 expression could suppress
breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Collectively, our clinical and in vitro
studies suggest that LINC00472 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Evaluating
this long non-coding RNA in breast tumors may have prognostic and predictive value
in the clinical management of breast cancer.

cells is partially responsible for these changes [3, 6, 7].
Many studies have been conducted to search for disease
features that can help to predict disease outcome and
treatment response, but no robust tumor markers have yet
been identified.
Proteins are considered to be the major molecules
carrying out essential biologic actions [8], yet only 2%
of the human genome contains the codes for proteins.
Most genomic sequences are now understood to be
transcribed, though without translation capability [9].
These non-protein coding transcripts are involved in many
biologic processes and cellular activities. Recently, long

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common female
malignancy, annually accounting for more than a million
new diagnoses worldwide [1]. Although breast cancer
has been studied extensively for decades, mechanisms of
tumor progression have remained largely elusive. Tumor
heterogeneity is a major challenge to understanding
the disease. Breast cancer varies not only from patient
to patient, but also within the same tumor. The disease
evolves over time and changes in response to chemo- and
hormonal therapies [2–5]. The unstable genome of tumor

cancer cells, we measured LINC00472 expression in more
than 300 breast tumor samples to analyze its association
with clinical and pathological features of breast cancer,
conducted a meta-analysis on more than 2 dozens
independent clinical studies to confirm the findings of our
clinical study, and transfected a LINC00472 expression
vector into breast cancer cells to assess the lincRNA’s
effects on cell growth and migration. In this report, we
describe the findings of LINC00472 in our clinical study,
meta-analysis and in vitro experiments.

non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were recognized as a
new class of non-coding RNAs with important biologic
functions [10–16]. LncRNAs exert their actions through
interactions with chromatin in the regulation of gene
expression [17–20], modulation of epigenetic regulation
pre- and post-transcriptionally [21–23], and influences on
activities and locations of other functional molecules such
as proteins and other RNA species [12, 14, 24–29]. Studies
have shown that disruption of lncRNA action occurs in
certain diseases including cancer [30–34].
In search of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database from the NCBI website, we found that a novel
long intergenic non-coding RNA, LINC00472 [35]
(Supplementary Figure S1), frequently appeared on top
of the gene transcript lists that are associated with tumor
grade or disease death in several breast cancer microarray
datasets. We searched the literature and found no
information on this lincRNA with regard to its biological
functions and associations with cancer or other diseases.
To determine the clinical relevance of LINC00472 in
breast cancer and to assess its biologic effects on breast

RESULTS
Clinical study
In the clinical study of 348 tumor samples, high
LINC00472 expression occurred more often in patients
with smaller tumors ( p < 0.0001), lower tumor grades
( p < 0.0001), and earlier stage disease ( p = 0.007)
(Table 1). Also, patients with positive hormone receptors
had higher LINC00472 expression compared to those

survival analysis on these 12 datasets after LINC00472
expression was grouped into 3 categories similar to those
of our own study. Of the 12 studies, 9 showed significant
individual associations between high LINC00472 and
favorable survival outcomes (Supplementary Figure S3).
Meta-analysis showed both overall survival (Figure 3A)
and disease-free survival (Figure  3B) were significantly
improved in patients with high LINC00472 compared to
those with low expression. Overall, the results of these
analyses were in agreement with our own study.

Meta-analysis of GEO data

To examine the effect of LINC00472 on breast
cancer cells, we analyzed LINC00472 expression in
MCF7 and SKBR3, and found that the expression was
low in these cell lines. We created an expression vector,
pCDH_LINC00472 (Supplementary Figure S4), and
transfected the vector into breast cancer cells to increase
LINC00472 expression. The transfection was successful
based on the GFP signal and RT-qPCR analysis (Figure 4).
Cell proliferation assays showed that LINC00472
expression significantly inhibited tumor cell growth
(Figure 4). Furthermore, in the cell migration experiments,
we found that both MCF7 and SKBR3 cell lines exhibited
reduced migration after being transfected with LINC00472
expressing vectors (Figure 5). These in vitro experiments
suggest that increased LINC00472 expression may

In vitro experiments

Twenty-seven datasets containing clinicopathologic
information were identified in the GEO database
(Supplementary Table S1). In a meta-analysis, we found
higher LINC00472 expression to be associated with welldifferentiated tumors (low grades) and less aggressive
disease (positive ER or PR, negative lymph nodes, luminal
A and normal-like molecular subtypes) (Figures 2A, 2B). In
GEO, 4 datasets compared gene expression between normal
breast tissues and tumors. The comparison showed higher
LINC00472 in normal than in tumor tissues (Supplementary
Figure S2). Furthermore, 15 datasets in GEO contained
information on various survival outcomes, of which 12
included more than 100 patients individually. We performed

suppress tumor cell proliferation and migration, which is
consistent with the findings of our clinical studies.

(Supplementary Figure S1), which have been reported to
have possible effects on breast cancer invasion, metastasis
and patient response to chemotherapy [36–42]. Although
LINC00472 has not yet been functionally characterized
for cellular activities or molecular processes, the results
from multiple independent datasets and different platforms
suggest that this lincRNA may behave like a tumor
suppressor. Our in vitro experiments also indicates that
LINC00472 can suppress cell proliferation and migration.
We notice that the deletion of this gene is rare in the
TCGA data [43, 44], and therefore the low expression of
LINC00472 in breast cancer is likely due to the downregulation of expression. The biological mechanisms that
control the expression of LINC00472 are still unknown.
Very recently a new clone (RP1–288M22) on
chromosome 6q12–13 was submitted to NCBI. This clone
expands the LINC00472 transcript to more than 9,000 bp
(NR_026807.2) with three additional transcript variants
of similar size. Our RT-qPCR primers were able to detect
all four transcripts according to the NCBI Blast results
(Supplementary Figure S5). Concerning the probes in the
microarray chip from which the GEO data were generated,
one probe (235771_at) represents the new clone. We
compared the expression of this probe with the one used
in our study (220324_at) in 15 datasets where data were
available, and found a strong correlation of expression
between these probes (Supplementary Figure S6),
suggesting that our findings of LINC00472 expression
in association with breast cancer based on 220324_at
be applicable to the recent submission or renewal of
LINC00472.
Long non-coding RNAs are suspected to exert their
functions through interacting with ribonucleoprotein

DISCUSSION
Our clinical study showed that LINC00472
expression was significantly different by tumor grade, tumor
size, disease stage, receptor status and molecular subtype.
The expression was also associated with treatment response
and survival outcomes, suggesting potential prognostic and
predictive implications in clinical management of breast
cancer. More importantly, our findings are very consistent
across multiple datasets. This consistency is established
on the basis of more than 20 independent studies which
collectively included thousands of patients. The consistent
finding was also based on two different laboratory methods,
qPCR and microarray chips. Furthermore, our in vitro
experiments on breast cancer cell lines supported the
findings of our clinical studies. The overall consistency
among multiple clinical studies and between in vivo and
in vitro systems underscores the potential significance of
LINC00472’s involvement in breast cancer, especially in
tumor progression.
The gene encoding LINC00472 is located on
chromosome 6q13, and the verified transcript has 2, 933 bp
(NR_026807.1). The earlier annotation also contained a
predicted transcript (XR_241853.1) that is longer than
6,000 bp. We had designed two pairs of RT-qPCR primers
to analyze both transcripts, and found that they were highly
correlated (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001). Therefore, we chose the
one which covers both transcripts for our measurement of
expression in the study. Downstream from the LINC00472
gene, there are two microRNA genes, miR30c and miR30a

RNP complexes is difficult and time-consuming. To
date, only a few RNP complexes have been characterized
experimentally. Thus, computational prediction may
be a valuable alternative to help predict the possible
actions of LINC00472. We used a sequence-based
method, catRAPID omics, to search for the binding
proteins of LINC00472. Since catRAPID omics uses an
algorithm that combines multiple features in addition
to primary structure, its prediction is considered to be

relatively reliable. Importantly this method has been
used previously for testing several long non-coding
RNAs, such as Xist, the long non-coding RNA X-inactivespecific transcript, and the results of prediction have been
consistent with experimental findings. The LINC00472binding proteome returned from the catRAPID omics
analysis contained a total of 579 proteins, from which 127
showed high interaction propensities (Interaction Strength

onto the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) System for
a core analysis using the Ingenuity Knowledge Base as
a reference set. The IPA analysis suggested that proteins
interacting with LINC00472 may involve several diseases
and disorders, of which cancer is on top of the list
(Supplementary Figure S7). IPA analysis also indicated
that these proteins may be functionally involved in RNA
post-transcriptional modification and protein synthesis
and associated with 3 signaling networks where multiple
biomarkers are known for breast cancer diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment prediction (Supplementary
Figures S8A–S8C). Knowing the potential RNA bindingproteins may allow us not only to predict the possible
targets of the lincRNA, but also to design additional
experiments to assess its biologic functions.

Microarray technologies have substantially enhanced
the search of biomarkers for cancer prognosis, but long
non-coding RNAs in data generated by microarray analysis
have not been well interrogated. Using GEO2R, an
interactive web tool in GEO, we analyzed the relationships
of LINC00472 expression and breast cancer characteristics
in multiple GEO datasets generated from the most recent
microarray chips, the Affymetrix Human Genome U133
plus 2.0 array and the U133A array. Our finding of a
consistent association between LINC00472 expression
and breast cancer survival among various datasets
supports the validity of this association and indicates such
public databases invaluable to biomedical research. The
consistency in the associations with clinicopathologic
variables further strengthens the finding of our study.

Overall, our investigation was based on multiple
studies from diverse patient populations, and involved
a large number of patients. We also demonstrated the
results with different methods of lncRNA analysis
(microarray and qPCR). These differences in patient
populations and lab techniques lend strong support to
our findings of LINC00472 in breast cancer. However,
at present, very little is known about the exact functions
of this long non-coding RNA. Therefore, we have not
discussed the possible biologic mechanisms that may
explain why LINC00472 behaves like a tumor suppressor.
Whether our findings reflect direct effects of LINC00472
on breast cancer or indirect actions via other molecules is
unclear. More work is needed to elucidate the function of
LINC00472 and its role in breast tumorigenesis.

77 (22.1%) had hormonal therapy, and 107 (30.8%)
received both. The chemotherapy protocols administered
included CMF (cyclophosfamide, methotrexate,
5 fluorouracil; 600/60/600 mg/mq every three weeks for six
cycles), CEF (cyclophosfamide, epirubicin, 5 fluorouracil;

every three weeks for six cycles), and TXT-EPI-VNB
(paclitaxel-epirubicin-vinorelbine; 175/90/30 mg/mq
every three weeks for cycles). Tamoxifen was the only
agent used for endocrine therapy at that time. The dose
was one 20 mg tablet per day for five years or until disease
progression or intolerable toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The role of LINC00472 in breast cancer was
investigated through a) a clinical study in which we
analyzed LINC00472 expression in 348 tumors using RTqPCR, b) meta-analysis of microarray data deposited in
the GEO database, and c) manipulation of LINC00472
expression in breast cancer cell lines.

Analysis of LINC00472 expression
Fresh tumor samples collected from patients during
surgery were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately
after resection and stored at -80°C until analysis. All tissue
samples were examined by pathologists to confirm at least
80% tumor content. The tissue samples (~30 mg each) were
homogenized with ceramic beads in PowerLyzer (MO BIO),
and processed to extract total RNA using Allprep DNA/RNA
Kit (Qiagen). The RNA samples were treated with RNasefree DNase and quantified using a spectrophotometer.
PCR primers were designed using the sequence
NR_026807.1 (Supplementary Figure S1) and the
synthesis was done by IDT (San Diego, CA). Total RNA
(1 μg) was reverse transcribed using the cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (LifeTech); RT-qPCR was performed in
triplicate using SYBR Select Master Mix (LifeTech). In
PCR reaction (10 μl), cDNA template (0.5 μl) was mixed
with 200 nM primers and 5 μl SYBR PCR master mix.
PCR conditions were incubation at 50oC for 2 min to
activate UDG, 95oC for 2 min to activate Taq polymerase,
and 40 cycles of 95oC for 15 s and 60oC for 1 min.
LINC00472 measurement was normalized to GAPDH
using the formula described in Statistical Analysis.

Clinical study (Turin_Study)
Breast cancer patients
A clinical study of breast cancer was conducted in
the University Hospital at University of Turin, in Italy,
between January 1998 and July 1999. The study was
approved by the university’s ethics review committee.
During the study, 348 breast cancer patients were enrolled
and provided informed consent. All study patients
underwent surgical resection for breast cancer. Average
age at surgery was 57 years (range: 23–84 years). Of the
patients enrolled, 302 had follow-up information available
through February 2007. Median follow-up was 86 months
(range: 8–108 months). During follow-up, 81 patients
developed recurrent or metastatic disease, and 55 of them
died from the disease. A total of 60 died by the end of
follow-up. Among the patients enrolled, 36.4% had
Stage I disease (TMN), 53.4% had Stage II, and 10.3%
had Stage III or IV. Patients diagnosed with Grade 1
(well differentiated) tumors comprised 16.6%, Grade 2
41.1%, and Grade 3 42.3%. Ductal carcinoma accounted
for the majority of cases (63.1%), followed by lobular
carcinoma (16.1%), other specific types (10.7%), and
mixed histologic types (10.1%). Two hundred one patients
(58.1%) had tumors smaller than 2 cm, 120 (34.7%) had
tumors between 2 and 5 cm, and 25 (7.2%) had tumors
greater than 5 cm. One hundred sixty patients (46.8%)
had lymph node-positive tumors. Sixty-five percent of
the patients had ER positive tumors, and 52.2% had PR
positive tumors (at 10% cutoff for receptor positivity).
Of the 348 patients, 303 received adjuvant therapy after

Meta-analysis of GEO data
Gene expression data generated from the Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 array and U133A array
were selected from the GEO database. These datasets
include 4, 628 breast cancer samples (Supplementary
Table S1) and 193 normal breast tissues (Supplementary
Figure S2). Expression data from probe 220324_at (which
targets LINC00472) were used for meta-analysis, in which
normalized expression was dichotomized using studyspecific median expression as cutoff to define “LINC00472_
higher” at or above median versus “LINC00472_lower”
below median. Clinical and pathologic variables were also
dichotomized. For each variable, summary odds ratios

and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated using
the inverse variance weighted method. Because the metaanalysis involved expression data assessed by different
methods, we used the random-effects model. Forest plots
were used to present the results. The meta-analysis was
conducted with the use of Review Manager (Revman
Version 5.3, Copenhagen, Denmark). Cochran χ2 test and
I2 statistic were used to assess the heterogeneity among the
studies involved. For datasets with more than 100 patients,
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed on
individual studies (Supplementary Figure S3).

transfection with plasmids pCDH or pCDH_LINC00472,
equal amount of cells were plated into the Oris 96-well
plate which was incubated overnight with stoppers to
permit cell attachment. Stoppers were removed from wells
except the reference wells in which the stoppers were
remained in place until results were read as pre-migration
controls. Media was removed and wells were gently
washed with sterile PBS. After that, fresh culture media
was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for
another 24 hours to allow for cell migration. The cultured
cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet stain.
The photomicrograph of the entire wound area was taken
using the IX71 inverted microscope with 4X objective
lens. Using a detection mask, the absorbance at 590 nm
wavelength in each well, which was directly proportional
to the number of cells that migrated into the ‘wound’ area,
was measured by a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M3
Multimode Plate Reader).

In vitro experiments
Preparation of LINC00472 construct
A LINC00472 transcript (2933 bp, NR_026807.1)
was assembled using the EST clones, EHS1001–
207275390, EHS1001–207498495, EHS1001–207533792,
EHS1001–207590772, EHS1001–210281579, and
EHS1001–211231922 (Thermo Scientific Open
Biosystems). Restriction digestion sites for NheI and
BamHI were incorporated into each site of the LINC00472
transcript for cloning and verification. The entire
sequence was inserted into a lentiviral expression
vector, pCDH-EF1-MCS-pA-PGK-copGFP-T2A-Puro
(System Biosciences). The construction was done by
Science Exchange (Supplementary Figure S4). The clone
authenticity was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion
(Supplementary Figure S4) and sequencing analysis.

Statistical analysis
LINC00472 expression was calculated as an
expression index (EI), using the formula 1,000 × 2(–ΔCt),
where ΔCt = Ct (LINC00472) – Ct (GAPDH). For data
analysis, EI was analyzed as a categorical variable with 3
ordinal levels, low (< 25 percentile), Intermediate ­(25–75
percentile, labeled as “Mid” in Table 1), and high
expression (> 75 percentile). Associations of LINC00472
with clinical, pathologic and treatment variables and
survival outcomes were determined using the Chi-square
test or Cox proportional hazards regression model,
as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
constructed to show survival differences according to
LINC00472 expression. The survival time for either overall
or disease-free was calculated as the time from surgery
until the occurrence of death and relapse, respectively. The
Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing differences
in cell counts and migration. Spearman correlation
coefficients were calculated for correlation analysis. All
statistical tests were two-sided, and a p value less than 0.05
was considered as statistical significance.

Cell culture experiments
Breast cancer cell lines, SKBR3 and MCF-7, were
a kind gift from Jun Panee (JABSOM, University of
Hawaii) and were grown in DMEM medium containing
10% FBS and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin
(Pen/Strep). We transfected the cells with the LINC00472
vector (pCDH_LINC00472), along with mock transfection
and transfection of a control vector (pCDH). After 24 h
incubation, cells were examined for GFP fluorescence; the
evaluation was repeated in 48 h. After that, total RNA was
extracted from the cells, and reverse-transcribed for qPCR
analysis of LINC00472 expression which was normalized
to GAPDH and compared between cells with different
transfection conditions.
