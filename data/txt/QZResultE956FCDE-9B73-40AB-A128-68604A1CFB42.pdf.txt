BACKGROUND: Imatinib is an effective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) in chronic phase (CP). Although some patients may fail on therapy with imatinib, effective salvage therapy is
available with second-generation TKIs. Current measurement of efficacy for each therapy is judged by its individual
impact on overall survival and event-free survival (EFS). METHODS: In total, 586 patients with CML in CP who
received imatinib were included in this analysis in 2 cohorts: imatinib as front-line therapy (n ¼ 281) or after failure on
interferon-a (IFN-a) (n ¼ 305). By accounting for successful salvage treatment (ie, regain of complete cytogenetic
response), the current EFS (CEFS) rate was calculated to obtain a more accurate impression of the outcome of
patients with CML who received treatment with sequential TKIs. RESULTS: For patients who received imatinib after
failing on IFN-a, the 7-year EFS rate was 61%, whereas the CEFS rate was 69%. The 7-year EFS rate for patients who
received imatinib as initial therapy was 81% compared with a 7-year CEFS rate of 88%. CONCLUSIONS: CEFS provided a more accurate representation of the outcome of patients with CML in CP. These patients may frequently be

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with a hallmark balanced translocation between
chromosomes 9q34 and 22q11 (the breakpoint cluster region-c-abl oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase [BCR-ABL] domain), which produces a constitutively active tyrosine kinase.1 CML represents approximately 15% of all leukemias, and
these patients have a median age at presentation of 66 years according to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) Program and from 50 years of clinical trials.2,3 Before 2001, the standard therapy for patients with
CML was interferon-a (IFN-a) either alone or in combination with cytarabine. Since the introduction of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), the outcome for patients with CML has changed dramatically.4,5
Imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the management of CML and has become the standard of care for first-line
therapy.6-11 Although imatinib is highly effective overall, approximately 33% of patients may not have the desired outcome because of primary or secondary resistance or because of intolerance to imatinib. For those patients, effective salvage
therapy is now available with several second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib [investigational]).12-15 Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates of 40% to 50% have been reported with these agents among patients who have resistance or intolerance to imatinib. There is growing interest in exploring new strategies to improve on the results reported
from frontline therapy with imatinib. These include the use of higher initial doses of imatinib16-22 as well as using secondgeneration agents as initial therapy.23-25 Early reports of these approaches suggest that they result in a high response rate,
with responses occurring earlier than with standard-dose imatinib, and the expectation is that this may result in an
improved long-term outcome.

Original Article

Currently, the efficacy of each CML therapy is
measured individually by reporting the response rate as
well as the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival.
However, these calculations do not take into account the
effect of successful salvage therapy with subsequent TKIs.
That is, a patient who develops resistance to imatinib may
have a successful treatment with a second-generation TKI.
Thus, an event (eg, loss of major cytogenetic response
[MCyR] or complete hematologic response [CHR]) can
be reversed by successful treatment with a subsequent
intervention.
In the current study, we investigated the effect of
consecutive TKI therapy for patients with CML. To this
end, we analyzed current EFS (CEFS). This approach has
been used in the stem cell transplantation (SCT) setting,
in which recurrences can be salvaged by using donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or repeat SCT.26 During TKI
therapy, CEFS estimates the probability that a patient is
alive and in remission with sequential TKI therapy.

A CHR was defined as a white blood cell count <10
 109/L, a platelet count <450  109/L with a normal
differential, and the disappearance of signs related to leukemia that was sustained for at least 4 weeks. Cytogenetic
response was assessed by G-banding with at least 20 metaphases counted and was defined as CCyR (0% Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positive metaphases), partial
cytogenetic response (PCyR) (1%-35% Ph-positive
metaphases), or minor cytogenetic response (36%-95%
Ph-positive metaphases). MCyRs included CCyRs and
PCyRs.
For the purpose of the current analysis, CCyR was
considered the minimum adequate response. Any patient
who did not achieve CCyR by 18 months of therapy or
who lost CCyR at any time had what we considered an
event. Survival was calculated from the time treatment
with imatinib was initiated until death from any cause or
last follow-up. EFS was defined as the time from the
start of imatinib to the occurrence of an event or last
follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Statistical Analysis
A multistate Markov model was used to estimate CEFS.26
To calculate CEFS, a patient failing on imatinib by not
achieving CCyR by 18 months from the start of therapy
or a patient losing CCyR at any time was considered an
event. Patients who received subsequent therapy with
another TKI and achieved CCyR were considered rescued
at the time the response was achieved, thus reversing the
event at the time the CCyR was documented. This
resulted in an upward change in the CEFS curve, because
patients once again were considered at risk for recurrence.
For the purposes of this analysis, only patients who transitioned from 1 TKI to another TKI immediately after failure on the previous TKI were considered rescued if they
responded to the second TKI. Patients who received any
therapy other than a TKI after failure on imatinib were
considered to have an ‘‘irreparable’’ event, even if they
received another TKI at a later date and responded to it.
Thus, only patients who received continuous, sequential
TKIs were considered salvageable for the purpose of
CEFS calculations.

Population
All patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) who
received imatinib at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center from December 1999 to December 2005 were included whether they received imatinib after IFN-a or as initial therapy. All patients were
included in clinical trials approved by the Institutional
Review Board and were conducted in accordance with the
Helsinki Declaration. All patients signed an informed
consent document that was approved by the Institutional
Review Board before they entered any study.
Patients received a starting dose of imatinib 400 mg
or 800 mg daily either as initial therapy or after failure on
interferon. Since September 2004, several second-generation TKIs entered clinical trials. Thus, upon developing
resistance or intolerance, patients could receive these
agents in phase 1 or 2 studies at various doses according to
the different trials, as reported previously.14,27-30
All patients were followed with peripheral blood
counts, and all underwent a bone marrow aspiration with
cytogenetic analysis before the start of any new TKI and
every 3 to 6 months during the course of therapy. The definition of CP for all of these studies included the presence
in peripheral blood or bone marrow of a blast count
<15%, a basophil count <20%, a blast and promyelocyte
count <30%, and a platelet count >100  109/L.

Imatinib After Failure on Interferon-a
From December 1999 to December 2005, 305 patients
received imatinib after failure on IFN-a. Their median
age was 54 years (range, 23-81 years) (Table 1). By the
time imatinib was initiated, these patients had been diagnosed with CML for a median of 32 months (range, 2221 months) and had received IFN-a therapy for a median of 1.5 years (range, 0.1-10 years). Their best response
to interferon was an MCyR in 114 patients (37%; including CCyR in 54 patients [18%]), minor cytogenetic
response in 35 patients (11%), and CHR in 86 patients
(28%). Reasons for discontinuing IFN-a included cytogenetic resistance in 141 patients (46%), hematologic resistance in 37 patients (12%), intolerance in 123 patients
(40%), and unknown in 4 patients (1%).
The starting dose of imatinib was 400 mg for 262
patients (86%) and 800 mg for 43 patients (14%). The

best response to imatinib was CCyR in 218 patients

those patients (96%) regained CCyR (22 with a second
TKI, 3 with a third TKI), but 3 patients subsequently later
lost their response. Eighty-seven patients (29%) never
achieved CCyR on imatinib. Among them, 14 patient
responses were not considered events, because these
patients were lost to follow-up or discontinued for toxicity
before 18 months of therapy, whereas the other 73 patient
responses were considered events. Eighteen of those 73
patients (6%) immediately received subsequent therapy
with TKI, and 6 patients achieved and maintained CCyR
(2 more patients achieved but subsequently lost their
CCyR). One of 4 patients who received a third TKI
achieved and maintained CCyR.
Therefore, 114 patients (37%) patients were considered treatment failures, either because they did not achieve
CCyR (n ¼ 73) or because they lost CCyR (n ¼ 41).
Among the patients who failed on imatinib, 70 patients
(23%) did not receive another TKI immediately after failure on imatinib and, thus, their failures were considered
irreparable events for the purpose of calculating CEFS for
the following reasons: Sixty-two patients (20%) failed on

330

imatinib therapy before the start of the phase 1 trials with
second-generation TKIs, including 7 patients who
received non-TKI treatment after failure on imatinib and
eventually received another TKI (dasatinib, 6 patients;
several subsequent TKIs, 1 patient). Only 1 of those 7
patients achieved transient CCyR. Of the 8 other patients
who did not receive a TKI immediately after failure on
imatinib, 4 patients remained on imatinib, 1 patient
developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia and died, 2 patients were lost to follow-up, and 1
patients underwent autologous SCT and regained CCyR
with the addition of imatinib.
Of the 44 patients who received a second TKI immediately after failure on imatinib, 33 patients (75%)
achieved CCyR, thus reversing the event. After a median
follow-up of 33 months (range, 3-67 months) on the second TKI, 24 patients (55%) had a sustained CCyR. Three
patients who achieved CCyR discontinued their second
TKI for intolerance (1 patient received a third TKI and
regained CCyR). Five patients lost CCyR (2 patients subsequently received non-TKI therapy, 1 patient received

no further therapy, 1 patient was lost to follow-up, and 1
patient failed on a third TKI). Nine of 20 patients who
did not achieve or who did not maintain CCyR on a second TKI received a third TKI, and 5 patients achieved
CCyR. The median complete response duration was 22
months (range, 1-46 months) on a second TKI and 9
months (range, 3-23 months) on a third TKI.
Thus, 114 patients (37%) had an event, but 28
patients (9%) were rescued successfully with a second TKI
(24 patients) or a third TKI (4 patients) (Fig. 1). In total,
162 patients (53%) who received a TKI after failure on
IFN-a remained in CCyR. Considering the standard
method for estimating the EFS rate, the 7-year probability
of remaining alive and event-free for these patients was
61%. When considering the salvage through successful
intervention with consecutive TKIs, the 7-year CEFS rate
was 69% (Fig. 2).
Frontline Imatinib Therapy
In total, 281 patients received imatinib as initial therapy
for early CP CML from July 2000 to July 2005. Their
median age was 48 years (range, 15-84 years). The Sokal
risk score was low for 183 patients (65%), intermediate
for 78 patients (28%), and high for 20 patients (7%). The
starting dose of imatinib was 400 mg for 73 patients
(26%) and 800 mg for 208 patients (74%). The best
response to imatinib was CCyR in 248 patients (88%),
PCyR in 15 patients (5%), and a minor cytogenetic

response in 5 patients (2%). Nine patients (3%) did not
achieve any cytogenetic response, and 4 patients (1%)
were not evaluable for cytogenetic response (treated for
<3 months).
After a median follow-up of 68 months (range, 2-107
months), 206 patients (73%) maintained CCyR while on
imatinib (Table 2). Of the 75 patients (27%) who were
taken off therapy, 23 patients (8%) lost CCyR, 33 patients
(12%) never achieved CCyR, and 19 patients (7%) stopped
imatinib while in CCyR. Of the 23 patients who lost
CCyR (ie, had an event), 16 patients immediately received
a second TKI, and 11 patients (69%) regained CCyR that
was sustained. Of the 33 patients who never achieved
CCyR, 18 patients had what were considered events. Seven
of those patients received a second TKI, and only 4 patients
achieved CCyR. Fifteen other patients had failures that
were not considered events, because they discontinued therapy or were lost to follow-up before 18 months on therapy.
Overall, 41 patients (15%) failed on imatinib according to
our definition of events. Of these, 5 of 41 patients (12%)
were lost to follow-up after a loss of response, and 13
patients (32%) received non-TKI therapy after discontinuing imatinib; these responses were considered irreparable
events. Of the remaining 23 patients who received a
subsequent TKI immediately after failure on imatinib, 14
patients (67%) achieved and maintained CCyR (9 patients
on dasatinib and 5 patients on bosutinib), and 1 patient
(4%) achieved CCyR and then underwent SCT while in
CCyR. The median CCyR duration with a second TKI was
14 months (range, 2-48 months). Eight patients (35%) did
not achieve CCyR after a median of 11 months (range, 127 months) on a second TKI (4 patients on dasatinib, 2
patients on nilotinib, and 2 patients on bosutinib). Five of
those 8 patients later received a third TKI, but none
achieved CCyR.
In summary, of the 281 patients who received imatinib as initial therapy, 41 patients (15%) experienced an
event. Of these, 14 patients (5%) were rescued successfully with a second TKI (Fig. 3). The projected 7-year
EFS rate for this patient group was 81% based on the conventional method for estimating EFS. After adjusting for
effective therapy with a subsequent TKI immediately after
failure on imatinib, the projected 7-year CEFS rate was
88% (Fig. 4).

introduced first for patients who had experienced failure
on IFN-a; and, soon thereafter, it became standard initial
therapy. The long-term results from the International
Randomized Study of Interferon Versus STI571 (IRIS)
trial reported a CCyR rate of 82% and a 7-year projected
EFS rate of 81%.31 That calculation included considerable censoring and did not account for patients who discontinued imatinib because of toxicity or who did not
achieve MCyR. In an intention-to-treat analysis, and
expanding the definition of EFS to include these adverse
outcomes, de Lavallade et al reported a 5-year probability
of 62.7%.8 Shortly after the introduction of imatinib,
second-generation TKIs were developed with the aim of
overcoming resistance to imatinib, most frequently mediated through BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. These
agents have now become standard second-line therapy in
CML. With dasatinib, a CCyR rate of 49% was reported
with a 15-month progression-free survival estimate of
90%.29 Similarly, with nilotinib, 31% of patients
achieved CCyR after 6 months. Ninety-six of those
patients that achieved MCyR remained alive and free of
progression for at least 6 months.14 Currently, these

agents are used sequentially in patients who are resistant
or intolerant to imatinib.
EFS rates reflect the expected outcome after the
given intervention, isolated from any subsequent events.
Defined this way, the EFS in our series is similar to that
reported in the literature. For patients who received imatinib after failure on IFN-a, a recent report from a large,
pivotal imatinib trial reported a progression-free survival
rate of 61% at 6 years6; whereas, in the current report, we
observed an EFS rate of 61% at 7 years. For patients who
received initial therapy with imatinib, the IRIS trial
reported an EFS rate of 81% at 7 years,31 identical to the
81% EFS rate in our report. Some of the definitions for
EFS consider only the loss of MCyR as an event. However, CCyR is the minimum acceptable response in the
era of TKIs. Thus, for the purposes of the current analysis,
we decided that patients should achieve at least CCyR.
Because several TKIs are available today, a patient
who fails on 1 TKI may be rescued successfully by a subsequent TKI. Thus, a more precise estimate of the longterm outcome after TKI therapy must consider these successful subsequent interventions. This is similar to a scenario after SCT in which a patient may develop disease
recurrence but can be rescued successfully by transplantation-related interventions, such as discontinuation of
immunosuppression or DLI. Craddock et al reported a
36% 5-year leukemia-free survival rate for patients with
CML who underwent transplantation in CP. However,
when accounting for effective therapy for recurrence after
transplantation, the CEFS rate was 49%.26 In our analysis, significant numbers of patients were able to achieve
CCyR and maintain that response with a second or even a
third TKI administered after imatinib failure. Furthermore, the patients who were not able to continue imatinib
because of intolerance while in CCyR were able to maintain their CCyR with a subsequent TKI. When accounting for these successful subsequent therapies, the CEFS
rate was 69% for patients who were treated after failure on
IFN-a, and it was 88% for patients who received imatinib
as initial therapy. The advantage of CEFS is that it provides us with a better estimate of clinical outcome with
the sequential use of TKIs.
It is possible that our calculations underestimated
the actual CEFS, because only patients who received consecutive therapy with TKIs were considered ‘‘rescued.’’
Patients who received an intervening therapy of any kind
in between therapy with TKIs were considered to have an
irreparable event to minimize bias. Also, for the purpose
of this analysis, discontinuing therapy for toxicity while in

Cancer

January 15, 2011

CCyR or before 18 months of therapy was not considered
an event. However, intolerance-related events clearly represent a failure on TKI therapy. In fact, patients with
intolerance to imatinib have a greater probability of
achieving CCyR with second-generation TKIs than
patients who are treated for resistance to imatinib.
Currently, several approaches are being considered
in an attempt to improve the outcome of patients with
CML. These approaches include a higher starting imatinib dose16-22 and the use of second-generation TKIs.23-25
The primary endpoints of these trials are early markers
of response, such as achievement of CCyR or a major
molecular response at 12 months. These endpoints are
appropriate as surrogate markers of longer term outcome.11,32,33 It is possible that these trials indeed will
result in an improved long-term outcome compared with
what is achieved with imatinib; however, it also is likely
that such an improvement will be modest considering the
already good results achieved with imatinib. When analyzing this possible improvement in EFS, it will be important to consider the results in the context of the expected
CEFS when treating patients with sequential TKIs, using
imatinib as initial therapy for patients who have a good
outcome, changing therapy for patients with resistance or
intolerance, and accounting for the success in these
patients with subsequent TKIs. We conclude that most
patients with CML can be treated effectively with the sequential use of TKIs. Assessing CEFS for patients who are
treated in this way provides a good estimate of the
expected long-term benefit of TKI therapy and depicts
more accurately the success we have accomplished in the
management of these patients.
