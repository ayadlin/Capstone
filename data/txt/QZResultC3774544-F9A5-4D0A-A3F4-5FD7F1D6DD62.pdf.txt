ABSTRACT
The current view of cancer progression highlights that cancer cells must undergo
through a post-translational regulation and metabolic reprogramming to progress
in an unfriendly environment. In here, the importance of neddylation modification
in liver cancer was investigated. We found that hepatic neddylation was specifically
enriched in liver cancer patients with bad prognosis. In addition, the treatment with
the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 in Phb1-KO mice, an animal model of hepatocellular
carcinoma showing elevated neddylation, reverted the malignant phenotype.
Tumor cell death in vivo translating into liver tumor regression was associated with
augmented phosphatidylcholine synthesis by the PEMT pathway, known as a liverspecific tumor suppressor, and restored mitochondrial function and TCA cycle flux.
Otherwise, in protumoral hepatocytes, neddylation inhibition resulted in metabolic
reprogramming rendering a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and concomitant
tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, Akt and LKB1, hallmarks of proliferative metabolism,
were altered in liver cancer being new targets of neddylation. Importantly, we
show that neddylation-induced metabolic reprogramming and apoptosis were
dependent on LKB1 and Akt stabilization. Overall, our results implicate neddylation/
signaling/metabolism, partly mediated by LKB1 and Akt, in the development of liver
cancer, paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting neddylation in
hepatocellular carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

signature and liver tumor regression, as a consequence
of tumor cell death and characterized by: a) reduced
levels of total sphingomyelines (SM) and a variety of
diacylglycerols (DAG), succinate, GTP, malonyl-CoA,
glycine; and b) augmented glycolic acid, triacylglycerols
(TAG) levels and the phosphatiylcholines (PC) synthesis
phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT)
flux. In protumoral hepatocytes, neddylation inhibition
resulted in metabolic reprogramming rendering a
decrease in the oxidative phosphorylation and increased
glycolysis, associated with cell apoptosis. Importantly,
we found that LKB1 and Akt are new targets of
neddylation, undoubtedly providing important insights
into the regulatory mechanism of these oncokinases and
reinforcing the role of neddylation as a tumor promoter.
Evidences of neddylation-mediated driven malignancy
further implicate this PTM as a potential novel therapeutic
target during liver tumor management and treatment.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of
death [1]. HCC etiology is very complex with multiple
and distinct signaling pathways converging in malignant
transformation [2]. The current view of cancer progression
supports that cancer cells must undergo through a posttranslational modification (PTM) regulation and a
metabolic switch or reprogramming in order to progress
in an unfriendly environment [3]. Neddylation is a PTM
by which the ubiquitin-like protein, neural precursor cell
expressed, developmentally downregulated 8 (Nedd8)
is conjugated to its target proteins. Since Nedd8 is a
key regulator of cell growth, viability and malignant
transformation [4], neddylation inhibition could prove
to be an effective anti-cancer therapy. Although the
cullin-RING family of E3 ubiquitin-ligases are the bestcharacterized Nedd8 substrates, other proteins have
been reported to be modified by Nedd8, including p53,
murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), epidermal growth factor
receptor, VHL tumour suppressor protein, L11, and other
RNA binding proteins such as human antigen R (HuR), a
hallmark of liver tumor progression [5-8]. Although not
described to date, several other proteins could be potential
neddylation targets.
Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and Akt kinases are
proteins known to play an important role in metabolism
regulation [9]. LKB1 directly phosphorylates and
activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a
central metabolic sensor [10]. Previously, we have shown
that LKB1 activity, highly representative in HCC patients
with poor outcome, has a surprising pro-oncogenic role
in liver tumors through the regulation of one of the major
oncogenes involved in the development and progression
of HCC, Ras [11]. Moreover, LKB1 in HCC regulates the
Akt-survival pathway independently of phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) [12]. On the other hand, Akt hyperactivation
can contribute to the genesis of cancer coupled to its role
in energy metabolism, including the so-called “Warburg
effect”. The Akt-dependent changes in energy metabolism
in tumor cells involve a coordinated regulation in both
glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation [13]. As with
LKB1, the deregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is
extremely relevant in HCC with over one hundred Akt
substrates involved in cell survival, proliferation and
metabolism [14]. Importantly, LKB1 and Akt are subjected
to PTM regulatory events, as ubiquitination [15]. To date,
neddylation regulation of LKB1 and Akt has not been
described.
Here, we have unraveled that neddylation is
specifically enriched in HCC patients with poor outcomes
providing a selective advantage to the tumors. In prohibitin
1 (Phb1)-KO mice, neddylation inhibition correlates
with a strong modulation of the cancer metabolic

was
previously described in many types of cancer [16].
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses revealed
significantly higher levels of global neddylation and of the
Nedd8 activating enzyme E1 (NAE1) in malignant tissues
from a cohort of human HCC (Fig. 1A). Additionally,
gene expression levels of Nedd8 and NAE1, examined
by analysis of published microarrays obtained from an
ONCOMINE search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14520), were increased in a cohort
of 225 HCC human samples versus 200 controls [17]
(Fig. 1B). Neddylation activity increase is more specific
of tumoral areas as can be observed in the IHC of a tumor
with respective surrounding tissue in Suppl. Fig. 1A.
Importantly, in a prospective study of patients with liver
cirrhosis on ultrasound surveillance at first diagnosis of
HCC, global neddylation at protein level as well as Nedd8
and NAE1 gene expression levels were significantly
higher in HCC patients with poor prognosis (Fig. 1CD). In agreement, Kaplan-Meier plot shows that elevated
neddylation levels were associated with lower survival
rates (Fig. 1E), while a logistic regression to quantify the
predictive value of neddylation revealed an AUC of 0.8
p<0.014 (Fig. 1F).
Overall our data underscore a robust regulation of
neddylation in clinical HCC.

develop HCC, such as the glycine N-methyltransferase
(Gnmt)-KO mice [19] (Suppl. Fig. 1D). Considering the
elevated neddylation levels in the Phb1-KO mice, the
therapeutic potential of the small molecule neddylation
inhibitor, MLN4924, was evaluated. For this purpose, 10
Phb1-KO mice, from 5 to 6-months old, were selected and
randomly assigned to two different experimental groups:
(i) injected subcutaneously with MLN4924 (60 mg/kg
body weight) and (ii) vehicle-treated, once a week for 8
weeks. Importantly, longitudinal evaluation by in vivo
high-frequency ultrasound fortnightly revealed a strong
reduction in the liver tumor size in the MLN4924-treated
mice (Fig. 2B, Suppl Table I) without visible biochemical
side effects as a consequence of the MLN4924-treatment
(Suppl. Fig. 2A, Suppl. Table II). Moreover, decreased
tumor size in the MLN4924-treated group was associated
with a down regulation of global neddylation, observed

To further study neddylation impact on liver
cancer, we used Phb1-KO mouse model. Prohibitin 1 is
a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed protein that
participates in diverse processes including mitochondrial
chaperone, growth and apoptosis. Liver-specific deletion
of Phb1 in mice results in spontaneous liver injury,
fibrosis, and HCC [18]. Like in clinical HCC, increased
neddylation levels, measured as accumulation of Nedd8cullin conjugated levels, associated with the presence of
malignant nodules in livers and hepatocytes from Phb1
-KO mice were observed (Fig. 2A, Suppl. Fig. 1B). In
agreement, neddylation was induced in human hepatoma
cell lines compared to non-tumoral hepatocytes, (Suppl.
Fig. 1C), and in other animal models that spontaneously

by decreased Nedd8-cullin conjugates and, of the already
known Nedd8 target, HuR [8] (Fig. 2C-D). As expected,
neddylation inhibition with MLN4924 promoted an
upregulation of the cullin-targets c-Jun and Nrf2 (Suppl.
Fig. 2B), as detected by Western blot analysis. In addition,
neddylation inhibition in Phb1-KO mice reduced liver
fibrosis (Suppl. Fig. 2A), further supporting the beneficial
role of MLN4924-treatment without the appearance of
secondary complications. High-throughput metabolomic
analysis on liver samples was performed to highlight
some of the mechanisms underlying tumor regression as a
consequence of neddylation inhibition.
Wide targeted metabolomics data revealed a strong
reduction of sphigomyelins (SM), SM(d18:0/22:0) (90%,
p<0.05) together with decreased diacylglycerols (DAG)
levels [DAG(32:1), DAG(32:2), DAG(34:2)] (~30%
p<0.05) in MLN4924-treated Phb1-KO mice (Suppl. Table
III, and Suppl Fig. 2C). On other hand, triacylglycerols
(TAG) were found to be increased as a result of neddylation
inhibition [TAG(54:6), TAG(54:7), TAG(56:7),
TAG(56:8), TAG(58:10), TAG(58:9)]. Importantly,
MLN4924 treatment increased the hepatic levels of
some types of phosphatidylcholines (PC) [PC(18:0/20:4)
(69% p< 0.05), PC(18:0/22:6) (89% p<0.05)] and
reduced those of the phosphatidylethanolamines (PE)
[PE(16:0/18:1) (54% p<0.05)] contributing to a significant

shift (40%, p<0.05) in the 16:0/18:1 and 18:0/20:4
species PC/PE ratio (Suppl. Table III). In the liver, PC
can be formed either by the Kennedy pathway or by the
phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferases (PEMT)
pathway. Phosphatidylcholines formed via PEMT pathway
are primarily enriched in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFA), such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3)
[20]. Thus, an increase in the PC(22:6n-3)/total PC ratio
(20%, p<0.05) was identified in MLN4924-treated Phb1KO mice suggesting increased PEMT flux.
Moreover, we observed that the central carbon
metabolism was tightly controlled by neddylation
inhibition in Phb1-KO mouse (Suppl. Table IV, Suppl. Fig.
2D). Importantly, pivotal metabolites like succinate [21,
22] were reduced after MLN4924-treatment. In agreement,
GTP levels, a readout metabolite from the catabolism of
succinate mediated by succinyl-CoA synthetase, were
diminished under these conditions. In addition, the hepatic
content of malonyl-CoA, a classical β-oxidation inhibitor,
was also downregulated in mice upon MLN4924 treatment
(Suppl. Table IV, Suppl. Fig. 1D). Importantly, glycine,
a metabolite that reflects proliferation rate across cancer
cells [23], was attenuated (21%, p< 0.05) after NAE1
inhibition. Finally, glycolic acid, the classical inhibitor
of the aerobic glycolysis through lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) activity [24], was increased in the liver of

in hepatocytes isolated from Phb1-KO mice. For this
purpose, hepatocytes were harvested from 8-month
old animals in order to obtain well-differentiated
hepatocytes showing a protumoral phenotype. The cells
upon neddylation inhibition, both with MLN4924 and
Nedd8 silencing, displayed a reduction in the oxygen
consumption rate (OCR), a surrogate of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the
extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a measure of
glycolysis, was increased as a result of neddylation
reduction (Fig. 3B). The observed OXPHOS reduction

were associated with an apoptotic response as analyzed
by caspase-3 activity (Fig 3C). Importantly, apoptosis
induction by MLN4924 treatment was only observed in
Phb1-KO hepatocytes and not in healthy hepatocytes
from wild type animals. Moreover, MLN4924 induced
cell death in Phb1-KO hepatocytes was associated with
a reduction in ATP (Fig. 3D) and augmented redox levels
(Fig. 3E).
Noteworthy, neddylation inhibition, using either
MLN4924 or Nedd8 siRNA, led to a strong stimulation
in the PEMT flux as shown for the incorporation of [3H]
ethanolamine into PE and PC in Phb1-KO hepatocytes
(Fig. 3F). The observed PEMT pathway induction as
a consequence of neddylation inhibition was observed
both following in vivo treatment as well as in isolated
hepatocytes. Previous work has shown that MLN4924
treatment induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells [25].
Here, we have extended this analysis and we have shown
also that apoptosis mediated by neddylation inhibition
induced either by MLN4924 or by Nedd8 silencing, in
human hepatoma cells, is accompanied by a decrease in
OXPHOS, an increase in the glycolytic flux and a higher
activity of the PEMT pathway (Suppl. Fig 3A-E).
All together our data support that neddylation
inhibition-induced apoptosis in Phb1-KO hepatocytes

is accompanied by alterations in cell metabolism as
decreased OXPHOS, increased glycolytic flux and higher
activity of the PEMT pathway.

New neddylation targets identified in liver cancer
Many of the oncogenic drivers observed in cancer
alter tumor-metabolism as part of their mode of action.
LKB1 and Akt are well known metabolism regulators
in healthy liver. However, the activity of both kinases
has been associated with HCC development [11-14].
Importantly, IHC and Western blot analysis showed that
LKB1 and Akt levels were considerably overexpressed in
HCC patients, being further increased in those with poor
outcome prognosis (Fig. 4A). Whereas increased protein
levels of LKB1 are associated with the transcriptional
upregulation of STK11 (the gene encoding for LKB1), the
same is not valid for Akt (Fig. 4B).
Notably, the logistic regression model showed a
good predictability for the levels of LKB1, Akt and global
neddylation (Fig. 4C) suggesting that the increased levels
of LKB1 and Akt in patients with liver cancer is associated
to elevated hepatic neddylation. In addition, LKB1 and
Akt ROC curves provide a significant value of area under

the curve (AUC) close to 1, indicating the good overall
ability of the test to discriminate between good and bad
prognosis (Fig. 4D).
As observed in clinical HCC, LKB1 and Akt levels
were also significantly overexpressed in the liver and
hepatocytes from Phb1-KO mice (Fig 5A), although these
proteins transcriptional levels were not significantly altered
(Suppl. Fig. 4A). Importantly, the neddylation inhibition
as a result of MLN4924-treatment was correlated with a
reduction of the LKB1 and Akt oncogenic proteins (Fig.
5B-C) only at the protein level (Suppl. Fig. 4B). LKB1
is an upstream regulator of AMPK. However, treatment

with MLN4924 was not associated with decreased AMPK
activation (Suppl. Fig. 2E), suggesting an uncoupling
between LKB1 and AMPK under neddylation inhibition in
liver tumor models. Increased phosphorylation of AMPK
under neddylation inhibition correlated with increased
caspase-3 as observed earlier [11].
Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of the in vivo
Nedd8 silencing, using siRNA approaches, in the wellestablished in vivo tumorigenesis HepG2 xenograft mouse
model. In these animals, a 66±11% decrease (p<0.05) in
tumor size (Fig. 5D) and a reduction of the levels of HuR
observed as a consequence of neddylation inhibition, were

also associated with decreased LKB1 and Akt levels (Fig.
5E). As detected in vivo, neddylation inhibition, both after
MLN4924-treatment and knockdown of Nedd8 by siRNA
in Phb1-KO isolated hepatocytes was also accompanied
with a fall in the total amount of the oncogenic proteins,
LKB1 and Akt (Fig. 6A-B), without regulation at the
transcriptional level (Suppl. Fig. 4C). In addition, Nedd8
specific-protease cysteine (NEDP1) overexpression, which
specifically removes Nedd8 molecules from conjugated
substrates [26], also reduced LKB1 and Akt levels in
Phb1-KO hepatocytes (Fig. 6C), without affecting their
transcriptional regulatioh (Suppl. Fig. 4C). As expected,
Nedd8-silencing accounts for decreased stability of
LKB1 and Akt, as observed from the reduced half-life

of these proteins after the inhibition of protein synthesis
by cycloheximide (Fig. 6D). The correlation found
between global neddylation and LKB1 and Akt levels,
prompted us to hypothesize that LKB1 and Akt could be
in partly regulated through neddylation. To verify this,
we overexpressed His6-Nedd8 in hepatocytes from wild
type animals. The enrichment analysis of His6-Nedd8
conjugated proteins revealed enhanced molecular bands
of LKB1 and Akt (Fig. 6E).
In summary, we reveal for the first time that
LKB1 and Akt are direct neddylation targets. As such,
neddylation inhibition is able to impair LKB1 and Akt
stabilization contributing to regulate the levels of these
two oncokinases.

LKB1 and Akt stabilization drives the metabolic
reprogramming induced by neddylation inhibition

under MLN4924 treatment (Fig. 7A). Overexpression
of both LKB1 and Akt per se accounts for increased
OCR and ECAR thereby promoting a more proliferative
phenotype in these premalignant hepatocytes (Fig 7B-C).
On the other hand, LKB1 and Akt silencing (Suppl. Fig.

7B-C). Moreover, MLN4924 treatment under LKB1 and
Akt-overexpression did not significantly alter OCR and

ECAR levels (Fig 7D). Interestingly, boosting the levels
of both LKB1 and Akt was sufficient to counteract the
apoptotic response mediated by neddylation inhibition
(Fig 7E).
In summary, the restoration of LKB1 and Akt
expression was able to block the metabolic reprogramming
and associated cell apoptosis induced by neddylation
inhibition. These data further support that both LKB1 and
Akt destabilization partially drive the metabolic phenotype
induced by lack of neddylation.

that neddylation inhibition resulted in augmented PEMT
activity in Phb1-KO mice. These data are in agreement
with the potential role of PEMT as a liver-specific tumor
suppressor and the inhibitory effects exerted by the
PEMT-dependent PC species in the Kennedy pathway
required for hepatocyte proliferation [29, 30]. Targeted
metabolomics performed in regressive liver tumors of
Phb1-KO mice after neddylation inhibition revealed an
improvement in TCA cycle and mitochondrial functions
as shown by a reduction in succinate, GTP and glycine
levels, metabolites often described as pro-proliferative
and showing hepatic damage-inducing properties [2123]. Moreover, reduced malonyl-CoA levels account
for augmented β-oxidation and formation of acetyl-CoA
to enter and further sustain restored TCA cycle flux. As
a result of improved mitochondrial function, aerobic
glycolysis is reduced as shown by augmented glycolic acid
levels, an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase activity [24].
In summary, following neddylation inhibition in Phb1KO mice, a reduced malignant phenotype translating into
tumor regression as a consequence of tumor cell death is
observed.
In the last couple of years, neddylation inhibition
has been widely implicated in tumor cell death in
several tissues [16]. In order to further study neddylation
inhibition-induced tumor cell death, we used welldifferentiated tumor Phb1-KO hepatocytes. Herein,
the metabolic slowdown observed after neddylation
inhibition was due to the negative impact that the absence
of Nedd8 has in the OXPHOS pathway ending in cancer
cell apoptosis. The mitochondrial apoptosis induced by
neddylation inhibition was also associated with an increase
of the PEMT flux as previously observed [31]. These
results are in agreement with early evidences implicating
MLN4924 and thereby neddylation inhibition actions
on cellular redox dysfunction [32]. As a consequence
of decreased OXPHOS, tumor cells need to look for
alternative energetic pathways such as glycolysis thereby
resulting in increased glycolytic flux. Interestingly, the
metabolic switch from OXPHOS to glycolytic flux,
usually advantageous to tumor cells, in here is associated
with increased tumor cell apoptosis. We speculate that
this is due to the fact that under neddylation inhibition the
cellular energetic pool, already compromised by reduced
OXPHOS, is being channeled to the high-demanding
energetic process of DNA rereplication, previously shown
to be induced in neddylation inhibition [33]. Importantly,
a reduction in the OXPHOS/glycolysis metabolic ratio as
a consequence of neddylation inhibition is associated with
augmented tumor cell apoptosis.
Considering that LKB1 and Akt kinases play
an important role in energetic metabolism regulation
and have been previously shown to be targets of PTM
regulatory events, we hypothesized that LKB1 and Akt
are potential neddylation targets. In agreement, during
the transformation of primary hepatocytes, in the liver of

DISCUSSION
Multiple signaling pathways appear to converge
in HCC [1]. The current view of cancer progression
highlights that cancer cells must undergo through a
PTM regulation and metabolic reprogramming in order
to progress in an unfriendly environment. Under this
basis, the neddylation pathway is essential for cancer
development through the activation of Cullin ring-ligases
and the degradation of their substrates [4]. In addition, the
neddylation-induced stabilization of other target proteins
can occur. Herein, we have investigated the importance
of neddylation in liver cancer signaling and metabolism
and more importantly its potential as a new therapeutical
approach.
We provide strong evidences that high neddylation
is associated with clinical HCC and poorest prognosis,
suggesting that it provides an advantage to tumor cells.
Moreover, in Phb1-KO HCC mice, reduced neddylation
levels as a result of its pharmacological inhibition using
the small molecule inhibitor MLN4924 was associated
with a distinguishable metabolic fingerprint associated
with tumor regression and characterized by: a) reduced
levels of total SM and variety of DAG, succinate, GTP,
malonyl-CoA, glycine; and b) augmented glycolic acid,
TAG levels and PEMT flux.
Recently, SM has emerged as an important molecule
to generate bioactive sphingolipids through ceramides.
SM synthase is an enzyme that generates SM and DAG
from PC and ceramides. As such, reduced SM and DAG
levels could reflect decreased SM synthase activity,
which is inhibited when the hepatocytes enter into the
S-phase after partial hepatectomy [27]. Based on these
evidences our results clearly suggest an association
between SM synthase, with reduced SM and DAG levels
and diminished proliferative phenotype. Moreover, DAG
cellular content has been previously associated with
oxidative stress, redox misbalance and mitochondrial
dysfunction [28]. Also, DAG exhibits a dual role in
cell biology serving as substrate for cell membrane
biosynthesis (phospholipids) and energy storage as TAG.
Thereby, under neddylation inhibition conditions, reduced
DAG levels as a result of improved mitochondrial function
and decreased proliferation may be channeled to TAG
synthesis. Lipidomics and enzymatic analysis showed

Phb1-KO HCC mice and more importantly in a cohort of
human HCC samples, a strong correlation in the levels
of LKB1, Akt and Nedd8 in the liver was observed. In
here, we report for the first time that both LKB1 and Akt
are new targets of neddylation modifications. Indeed the
overexpression of either LKB1 or Akt kinases counteracts
the metabolic reprogramming response mediated by
neddylation inhibition associated to mitochondrial
apoptosis (Suppl. Fig. 5). This is in agreement with early
reports showing that LKB1 deficient cells are less able to
restore ATP levels in response to metabolic stress and thus,
more susceptible to cell death [34], and with the important
role of Akt in OXPHOS and glycolysis balance [35].
Summing up, our results reveal for the first time
a completely new and unexplored role of neddylation in
the stabilization of the key oncogenic hallmarks, LKB1
and Akt. Moreover, we provide evidences that LKB1 and
Akt stabilization plays an important role on neddylationinduced metabolic disruptions in liver cancer further
suggesting neddylation as a potential therapeutic target in
HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male
C57BL6 WT and Phb1-KO mice via collagenase perfusion
as described before [8].

Animals
Three to eight month-old male Phb1-KO mice [18],
breded in the animal facility at the CIC bioGUNE, were
used. Animal procedures were approved following the
CIC bioGUNE Animal Facility’s guidelines with AALAC
certificate.

Cell Lines
In vitro experiments were performed using primary
mouse hepatocytes from Phb1-KO and the human
hepatoma cell lines BCLC3 and BCLC5, characterized
and provided by Dr. Bruix and Dr. Boix (BCLC group.
Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain).

Isolation and Culture of Primary Hepatocytes

Human Samples

Cell Treatment with MLN4924

Surgically resected liver specimens of 22 patients
with HCC (10 Hepatitis C, 10 ASH and 2 NASH)
were examined. The Basque Research Biobank (http://
www.biobasque.org) provided the data and type of
biospecimen. For the bad and better prognosis analyses
we used samples from 47 patients with liver cirrhosis and
HCC detected during surveillance. They had preserved
liver function and corresponded to BCLC stage A (n=34)
and B (n=13). These patients are part of another study,
reported elsewhere (Gut, submitted). All tissues samples
from this study were from US-guided liver biopsy of HCC
lesions. In brief, compensated patients with liver cirrhosis
under ultrasonographic surveillance for HCC, when first
identified as having developed a HCC lesion underwent
a dedicated imaging protocol (2 computed tomography
exams 6-weeks apart in a absence of any other therapy
to evaluate growth speed) and an US-guided liver biopsy
(to define transcriptomic characteristics of tumor). After
the 2nd computed scan, patients underwent therapy
according to internationally accepted guidelines. Patients
were divided in 4 quartiles according to HCC volume
doubling time and survival evaluated according to these
quartiles. Patients of the first quartile (Doubling time< 53
days) had a definitively worse prognosis that those of the
other quartiles (median survival 11 months vs 41, 42 and
47 months, respectively). Healthy human liver was used
as control for immunostaining. Patients gave informed
consent to all clinical investigations, in according to the

MLN4924 was provided by Millenium
Pahrmaceuticals Inc. Phb1-KO hepatocytes were treated
with MLN4924 at the dose of 3 µM for 48 hours using
DMSO as control.

Cell Transfection
Phb1-KO hepatocytes were transfected with 2 µg
of pcDNA3-FLAG-LKB1 (Addgene), pLNCX1-HAAkt (kindly provided by Dr. Carracedo, CIC bioGUNE,
Spain) or cysteine protease (NEDP1-V5) plasmids using
jetPRIMETM reagent (Polyplus). Two µg of pcDNA3LacZ (Invitrogen) and pLNCX1 plasmids (provided by
Dr. Carracedo) were used as negative controls of LKB1
and Akt, respectively.

In vitro Silencing
Primary Phb1-KO hepatocytes were transfected
with 100 nM Nedd8, LKB1 and Akt siRNA (Qiagen) using
jetPRIMETM reagent (Polyplus). Controls were transfected
with an unrelated siRNA (Qiagen). Protein knockdown
was confirmed by Western blotting. siRNA sequences are
shown in Supplementary Table V.

available kit ATPliteTM (Perkin Elmer).

Immunohistochemistry

Evaluation of ROS production

Paraffin embedded liver samples were sectioned,
dewaxed and hydrated. All procedures were done
according to standard protocols with EnVision+ System
HRP (Dako). Finally, samples were incubated with Vector
Vip substrate (Vector) for purple color development.
10 random images per sample were taken with a 10x
objective from a microscope AXIO Imager D1 (Carl Zeiss
AG, Oberkochen, Germany). Quantification of staining
intensity or area of each sample were calculated using the
manual selection tool of FRIDA software (FRamework for
Image Dataset Analysis) http://bui3.win.ad.jhu.edu/frida/.
Stained area was measured using ImageJ64 software
(NIH), images were transformed to RGB stacks, manually
thresholded for selection of the stained área and measured
with the measure tool to calculate the area percentage.
