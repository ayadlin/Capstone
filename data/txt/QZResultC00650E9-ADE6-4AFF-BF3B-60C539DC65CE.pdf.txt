News on: “Transcriptomic-metabolomic reprogramming in EGFR-mutant NSCLC early adaptive drug escape linking TGFb2-bioenergetics-mitochondrial priming” by Praveena S. Thiagarajan, et al. Oncotarget, 2016; 7(50):82013-82027. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13307

Lung cancer is the most common cause of
cancer-related death in the world [1]. Tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR, have led to multi-fold
improvements in survival for the 15-50% of patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying
activating mutations [1]. However, almost all will acquire
resistance and relapse after 1-2 years. The emergence of
T790M, a secondary mutation, accounts for approximately
50% of all the resistant mechanisms [2]. Third generation
EGFR TKIs that specifically target T790M have been
developed and have demonstrated clinical trial response
rates of ~60%. Cure for these patients remains unlikely
though, as further development of resistance via multiple
mechanisms have been observed [2].
The exact origin of acquired resistance to treatments
is still debated, with two major theories currently being
investigated [2]. One theory is that resistant subclones
pre-exist and are selected for by treatment, leading to the
development of resistant tumors. The second hypothesis is
that a subset of cells, known as drug tolerant cells (DTCs),
will adjust sufficiently to survive the therapy, giving them
time to acquire mechanisms of resistance [2].
Previously, Fan et al (2011) from Dr. Patrick Ma’s
group demonstrated that after just 6-9 days of treatment
with EGFR TKIs, residual DTCs exhibited increased
pSTAT3 and BCL-2/BCL-xL expression [3]. Combination
of EGFR TKI with BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibitor (such as
navitoclax) significantly hindered the development of
DTCs, both in vitro and in vivo. Others also have identified
a potential role for STAT3 in the DTC phenotype, albeit
through different mechanisms of activation [4, 5].
The ability of some cancer cells to survive continual
TKI-exposure allows them to act as a source from which
de novo resistance clones can arise. Ramirez et al (2016)
demonstrated that diverse mechanisms of resistance
could develop from DTCs-derived from a single EGFRaddicted lung cancer cell [6]. Hata et al. (2016) further
demonstrated that T790M-resistant populations which
evolved from DTCs were significantly less susceptible to
WZ4002, a third generation EGFR TKI, when compared to
populations derived from pre-existing subclones [7]. Thus,
the ability of these DTCs to give rise to unpredictable,
diverse, and potentially more potent mechanisms of
resistance adds to the complexity of tumor heterogeneity
and personalized medicine. There is an obvious need to

explore DTCs further in the context of improving efficacy
of TKI therapy. Ma’s group has now reported their further
study of this drug-tolerant population by characterizing the
transcriptomic and metabolomic changes in DTCs [8].
Thiagarajan et al (2016) demonstrated large
transcriptomic changes in HCC827 and H1975 cell lines
after 9 days of EGFR TKI treatment, with a return to
baseline expression levels after 7 days of drug “washout” [8]. This early onset adaptive drug-evading signature
showed decreases in processes such as cell cycle regulation
and proliferation, and increases in functions such as cell
adhesion and adoptive stem cell signaling. Due to its
presence in a significant number of these altered processes,
TGFβ2 was identified as potentially having a central
role in the early-adaptive response to TKI. Indeed, they
demonstrated that TGFβ2 had similar protein expression
patterns as phospho-STAT3 and its ability to induce the
expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCLxL, a potential mechanism for increased drug tolerance.
Further analysis of their transcriptomic data revealed
decreased expression of several key genes involved in
glucose metabolism (and thus the Warburg effect) after
initial EGFR TKI treatment. A mass-spectrometry based
global metabolomics profiling identified novel adaptive
metabolomics reprogramming in the DTCs that survived
TKI treatment. This reprogramming included suppressed
glycolytic pathway, TCA cycle pathway, branched chain
amino acids metabolism, lipid biogenesis, and enhanced
inflammatory metabolism. The authors note that these
findings are of significant clinical importance as this
early adaptive escape response would impede detection
by FDG-PET scanning, eliciting a radiographic complete
response designation.
The
transcriptomic
and
metabolomic
characterization of early response to EGFR TKIs has
provided further evidence for the role of BCL-2/BCLxL signaling in early response to TKI treatment. The
new link between TGFβ2 signaling with the previously
reported pro-survival BCL-2 and BCL-xL signaling
pathway in drug tolerance is intriguing and warrants
further investigation, especially using other pre-clinical
models such as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models
and clinical tissues. Their characterization of the metabolic
reprogramming after TKI treatment may have identified
novel therapeutic avenues.

While little more than anecdotal evidence exists
to suggest a role for the DTC phenotype in the clinical
development of acquired resistance, plenty of pre-clinical
work is amassing. Regardless if some or all patients have
pre-existing resistant subclones prior to treatment, it seems
logical that this ability of cancer cells to adapt and tolerate
treatment will remain an issue for future targeted therapy
strategies. Thus, further characterization of all mechanisms
of drug resistance and tolerance should identify optimal
drug cocktails to inhibit all origins of resistance, hopefully
bringing us that much closer to the cure.
