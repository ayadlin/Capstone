Abstract
Precision medicines exert selective pressure on tumor cells that leads to the preferential growth of
resistant subpopulations, necessitating the development of next generation therapies to treat the
evolving cancer. The PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the most commonly activated

pathways in human cancers1, which has led to the development of small molecule inhibitors that
target various nodes in the pathway. Among these agents, first generation mTOR inhibitors
(rapalogs) have caused responses in so-called “N-of-1” cases and second generation mTOR kinase
inhibitors (TORKi) are currently in clinical trials2–4. We sought to delineate the likely resistance
mechanisms to existing mTOR inhibitors as a guide for next generation therapies. The mechanism
of resistance to the TORKi was unusual in that intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR was increased,
rather than a direct active site mutation interfering with drug binding. Indeed, the identical drug
resistant mutations have been also identified in drug-naïve patients4, suggesting that tumors with
activating mTOR mutations will be intrinsically resistant to second generation mTOR inhibitors.
Here, we report the development of a new class of mTOR inhibitors which overcomes resistance
to existing first and second generation inhibitors. The third generation mTOR inhibitor exploits the
unique juxtaposition of two drug binding pockets to create a bivalent interaction that allows
inhibition of these resistant mutants.

The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was exposed to high concentrations of either a first
generation mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin or a second generation mTOR ATP competitive
inhibitor AZD8055 (a TORKi) for 3 months, until resistant colonies emerged. Deep
sequencing revealed that the AZD8055-resistant (TKi-R) clones harbored an mTOR
mutation located in the kinase domain at the M2327I position (Figure 1a, Extended Data
Figure 1a) while two rapamycin-resistant (RR) clones contained mutations located in the
FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB domain) at positions A2034V (RR1 cells) and
F2108L (RR2 cells). The clinical relevance of these mutations is supported by a case report
of a patient who acquired the identical F2108L mTOR mutation after relapse under
everolimus treatment5 (Extended Data Table 1).

To verify that the mutations altered the efficacy of their respective drugs and were not
simply passenger mutations, we analyzed the phosphorylation of effectors downstream of
mTOR in several cellular systems. In the RR cells, phosphorylation of the normally
rapamycin sensitive sites on S6K (T389) and S6 (S240/244 and S235/236) were unaffected
even at high rapalog concentrations (100 nM) (Figure 1b, Extended Data Figure 1b).
Phosphorylation of the key mTOR effector 4EBP-1 is normally unaffected by rapamycin but
strongly reduced by TORKi6–8. In the TKi-R cells, however, 4EBP-1 phosphorylation was
significantly less sensitive to a variety of TORKi (Figure 1c, Extended Data Figures 1c, d).
Consistent with this weakened signaling inhibition, the RR and TKi-R clones were
significantly less sensitive to their respective drugs in a 72h proliferation assay when
compared to the parental line (Figures 1d, e, Table in SI). To determine if the RR and TKi-R
mTOR mutations were directly responsible for the drug-resistance phenotype, each mutant
was expressed in another model, MDA-MB-468 cells, which confirmed that the mTOR
mutations are sufficient to promote dominant resistance (Extended Data Figures 2a-d).
FRB domain mutations have been found in untreated patients (Extended Data Table 2) and
previous random mutagenesis screens in yeast have shown that single amino acid changes in
the mTOR FRB domain confer rapamycin resistance9–12. The RR mutants identified in this
screen exhibit a similar mechanism of resistance by disrupting interaction of mTOR with
FKBP12-rapamycin complex in cells and in vitro (Figures 2a, b).

In contrast to the FRB domain mutations found in RR cells which line the rapalog/FKBP
binding pocket, analysis of the recently solved structure of the mTOR kinase domain in
complex with the TORKi, PP242, (PDB:4JT5)13 revealed that M2327 is >15Å away from
the inhibitor, suggesting either an allosteric mechanism of reduced TORKi affinity or that
this mutation causes resistance through a mechanism that does not involve reduced drug
binding. Indeed, both WT and M2327I mTOR bind AZD8055 with similar affinities (Figure
2c). We asked whether the M2327I mutation in the mTOR kinase domain altered the kinetic
properties of the kinase. As shown in Figure 2d, the M2327I mutant has a 3-fold increase in
mTOR kinase activity compared to the WT and RR mutants. This is consistent with the
higher P-S6K (T389), P-AKT (S473) and P-4EBP1 Ser 65 basal levels observed in these
cells (Extended Data Figure 1d).

Author Manuscript

The emergence of a hyperactive mTOR kinase domain mutation (M2327I) that could
theoretically confer a growth advantage led us to wonder if similar mutations might pre-exist
in drug-naïve patient tumors. Indeed, the precise M2327I mutation as well as other mTOR
kinase domain mutations have been identified in 5 untreated patients (Extended Data Tables
1, 3) 14, 15. To determine if additional mTOR kinase domain mutants were also hyperactive
and insensitive to TORKi, various mTOR kinase domain mutations that occur in patients
were inducibly expressed in MDA-MB-468 cells and tested for sensitivity to the TORKis
AZD8055 and MLN0128 (Extended Data Figures 2d, 2e). The concentrations of drug
required to inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 substrates in these cells were 3 to 30 fold higher
than those required in WT cells, although not all substrates show precisely the same dose
response.

Author Manuscript

These data suggest that the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase by single amino acid mutations
found in drug-naïve patients can reduce the sensitivity to ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors
in cells. These findings highlight the need for a new class of mTOR inhibitor capable of
targeting both drug-naïve (pre-existing) mTOR mutant-driven cancers, as well as emergent
resistant mutations.

We developed a molecular model of mTOR in complex with rapamycin-FKBP12 using the
FRB domain as the common domain in two available mTOR crystal structures (1FAP &
4JT5) (Figure 3a). This model revealed the juxtaposition of the rapamycin and TORKi
binding sites and suggested an avidity-based approach to overcome drug-resistant mutations
in either the FRB or the kinase domain. A bivalent mTOR inhibitor consisting of a
rapamycin-FRB binding element appropriately linked to a TORKi would be expected to
inhibit the RR class of FRB-domain mutants because the TORKi binding site would provide
high affinity recognition. For the TKi-R class of kinase domain mutations, a bivalent
inhibitor would be predicted to be similarly potent by virtue of an intact rapamycin binding
site. We reasoned that binding at one site would position the second half of the ligand in
close proximity for binding to the second site, thus overcoming point mutations that
diminish drug binding (as found in RR cells) or which hyperactivate the kinase (as found in
TKi-R cells)16. To develop a new bivalent class of mTOR inhibitors, we required a nonperturbing, strain-free linker between rapamycin and a TORKi, such that the resulting
inhibitor can simultaneously bind to both sites. Analysis of our mTOR-rapamycin-FKBP12
model revealed that the hydroxyl group at the C40 position of rapamycin is exposed to

solvent and is oriented toward the ATP binding site of mTOR (Figure 3a). Analysis of the
TORKi (PP242) bound structure (PDB:4JT5) revealed the N-1 position of the pyrazole ring
is oriented toward rapamycin and exposed to solvent (Extended Data Figure 3a). We selected
MLN0128 as the TORKi as it is a highly selective17 structural analog of PP242, and is
currently in clinical trials.

To determine the optimum linker length between the chosen sites we used the molecular
modeling program MOE18 to evaluate the potential energy of a methylene-based cross-linker
with lengths from 10 to 40 heavy atoms. This analysis revealed that 27 atoms would be the
minimal length required to span the two ligand-binding sites (Extended Data Figure 3b). We
incorporated a polyethylene glycol unit of varying lengths and used the azide-alkyne
cycloaddition reaction to synthesize RapaLink-1, -2, and -3 (Figure 3b, Extended Data
Figure 3c and Methods in SI). Our modeling suggested that RapaLink-3, with an 11-heavy
atom linker would be too short to allow optimal binding to both sites simultaneously while
RapaLink-1 and -2, which contain 39 and 36 heavy atom linkers, respectively, would allow
simultaneous bivalent binding to the mTOR-FKBP12 complex.

Author Manuscript

Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of either RapaLink-1, 2, or 3 and the
effects on mTOR signaling were assessed by Western blotting. We observed that both
RapaLink-1 and -2 inhibited the phosphorylation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 targets at
doses between 1 and 3 nM (Figure 3c). However, RapaLink-3, which contains the shortest
linker showed diminished potency against the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (T37/46/70 and
S65) and AKT (S473) while still inhibiting P-S6 (S240/244 and S235/236). This is
consistent with the prediction that a longer linker is necessary to allow simultaneous binding
to both drug sites and indicates that rapamycin binding is dominant over MLN0128 binding
due to the preferential inhibition of P-S6 over P-4EBP1. Consistent with its strong signaling
inhibition (Figure 3d), RapaLink-1 potently inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells at levels
comparable to rapamycin or a combination of rapamycin with MLN0128 (Extended Data
Figures 4a, 5).

Author Manuscript

We further tested the requirement of both halves of RapaLink-1 to simultaneously bind
mTOR. First, we measured the ability of RapaLink-1 to recruit FKBP12 to mTOR by
performing an in vitro FKBP12 binding assay; we show that RapaLink-1 is indeed able to
recruit GST-FKBP12 to mTOR WT (Extended Data Figure 4b, lane 12). Moreover, we used
the FKBP12 competitive ligand, FK506, to pharmacologically block RapaLink-1 from
interacting with FKBP12 and thus mTOR. We observed that FK506 completely rescued the
phosphorylation of mTORC1 and C2 substrates upon RapaLink-1 treatment (Extended Data
Figure 4c). Last, we isolated MCF-7 RapaLink-1-resistant cells; these cells harbor a
mutation located in the mTOR FRB domain at position F2039S. As shown in Extended Data
Figure 6a, rapamycin treatment did not inhibit P-S6K (T389) and P-S6 (S240/244 and
S235/236) in the mTOR F2039S cells as observed in the MCF-7 cells. Moreover, these cells
displayed a decreased sensitivity to MLN0128, combination of rapamycin and MLN0128 as
well as RapaLink-1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RapaLink-1:FKBP12’s
binding to the FRB domain is necessary for simultaneous binding to the ATP-site of mTOR
and therefore for RapaLink-1-dependent inhibition of mTOR signaling.

While the design of bivalent inhibitors for therapeutic use has had mixed success due to the
poor pharmaceutical properties of the hybrid molecules19, FKBP12-binding hybrids have
actually been used to improve the pharmaceutical properties of small-molecule inhibitors
unrelated to TORKi. These FK506-based hybrids exploit the high intracellular concentration
of FKBP12, specifically in blood cells, and the high affinity of FK506 for FKBP12 to create
a reservoir of drug that prolongs serum half-life20. In agreement with the improved
pharmaceutical properties of previous FKBP12-binding hybrids, RapaLink-1 showed
prolonged inhibition of mTOR signaling in vitro (Extended Data Figures 6b, c) as well as in
vivo after a tolerable dose of 1.5 mg/kg, which lasted for over 4 days (Extended Data
Figures 6d, e) and was able to inhibit the growth of WT mTOR MCF-7 xenografts as well as
the current clinical mTOR inhibitors (Extended Data Figure 6f).

To assess whether RapaLink-1 could block mTOR signaling of the F2108L mTOR and
M2327I mTOR drug resistant mutants, MDA-MB-468 cells expressing the alleles were
treated with either rapamycin, MLN0128, a combination of both drugs or RapaLink-1.
Consistent with RapaLink-1:FKBP12 complex’s ability to bind mTOR FRB and Kinase
Domain mutants (Extended Data Figure 4b: lanes 18 and 24), and increased avidity
(Extended Data Figure 7a); RapaLink-1 at low doses (3–10 nM) was the only drug regimen
capable of inhibiting mTOR signaling in both F2108L mTOR and M2327I mTOR
expressing cells (Figures 4a, b). Mouse xenografts of MCF-7 cells expressing the RR1
mutant A2034V mTOR showed significantly less sensitivity to rapamycin yet maintained
full sensitivity to AZD8055 and RapaLink-1 treatment (Extended Data Figure 7b, Figure
4c). Similarly, xenografts with MCF-7 cells expressing the TKi-R mutant, M2327I mTOR,
showed significantly less sensitivity to AZD8055 treatment, yet retained full sensitivity to
rapamycin and RapaLink-1 (Extended Data Figure 7c, Figure 4d). The dosing of
RapaLink-1 may be limited by toxicity, which can only be tested in the clinic. However, our
preclinical data and that of others21 suggests that mTOR kinase inhibitors can be given
safely when administered intermittently and are more effective than daily dosing schedules.
It is reasonable to anticipate that patients bearing hyperactive mTOR kinase domain
mutations, who originally respond to rapalogs, may eventually relapse due to the emergence
of a second FRB mutation, as previously observed5. To test if RapaLink-1 would be an
effective mTOR inhibitor in this case, MDA-MB-468 cells expressing F2108L/M2327I
mTOR mutations were generated. As expected, mTOR substrates were resistant to
rapamycin, MLN0128 and to a combination of both treatments in the F2108L/M2327I
double-mutant cells. Yet, the signaling of these double mutant cells remained as sensitive as
the mTOR WT cells to RapaLink-1 treatment (Figure 4e, Extended Data Figure 7d).

Through exploitation of both the ATP and the FRB binding sites of mTOR, we have
developed a new class of mTOR inhibitor which potently inhibits tumor growth and
signaling in WT mTOR expressing cells as well as in cells that have acquired resistance to
either rapalogs or ATP-competitive inhibitors or both. Such inhibitors have been developed
for GPCRs22 (termed bitopic ligands) but have not been exploited in protein kinase inhibitor
design. Interestingly, the only other bitopic kinase inhibitor we are aware of is the natural
CDK2/cyclin-A inhibitor p27. The peptidic inhibitor spans the cyclin box and extends into
the ATP site of CDK2, creating high affinity highly specific inhibitor23. Perhaps other

Selection of drug resistant clones

Author Manuscript

Cell lines resistant to rapamycin (RR1 and RR2) and AZD8055 (TKi-R) were generated by
exposing the parental breast cancer cell line MCF-7 to a high dose of drug (500 nM of either
rapamycin or AZD8055) for 3 months of continuous drug exposure (change of media every
3 days); the cells were then sent to sequencing. MCF-7-RapaLink-1-resistant cells were
generated by exposing MCF-7 cells to RapaLink-1 (10 nM) for 9 months of continuous drug
exposure (change of media once per week); the cells were then sent to sequencing.
gDNA Sequencing

Author Manuscript

We profiled genomic alterations in 279 key cancer-associated genes using our IMPACT
assay (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), which utilizes solution
phase hybridization-based exon capture and massively parallel DNA sequencing. Custom
oligonucleotides were designed to capture all protein-coding exons and select introns of 279
commonly implicated oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and members of pathways
deemed actionable by targeted therapies. We prepared barcoded sequence libraries (New
England Biolabs, Kapa Biosystems) for DNA from the MCF-7 parental cell line and drugresistant subclones, and we performed exon capture on barcoded pools by hybridization
(Nimblegen SeqCap). 250 ng of genomic DNA was input for library construction. Libraries
were pooled at equimolar concentrations (100 ng per library), combined with barcoded
libraries from a separate project, and input to a single exon capture reaction as previously
described26. DNA was subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to generate
paired-end 75-bp reads. We achieved a mean unique sequence coverage of 487X per sample.

The coordinate of the crystal structure of rapamycin with FKBP12 and FRB domain was
retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1FAP). The coordinate of the crystal
structure of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor (PP242) with mTORΔN and mLST8 was
retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (accession code 4JT5). Two co-crystal structures were
aligned and amino acids and water molecules in FRB domain of 1FAP were deleted. The
coordinate of co-crystal structure unavailable ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor (MLN0128)
was manually constructed by modifying the coordinate of the co-crystal structure of its
analog (PP242). The obtained modeling containing rapamycin and MLN0128 was energyminimized using the MMFF94x force field in Molecular Operating Environment (MOE,
described below)21 to provide a template structure. During the minimization procedure, the
following conditions were adopted. The dielectric constant was set to 4 × r, where r is the
interatomic distance. The residues, which are 9 Å away from compound, were fixed. And
atomic charges for the protein and the compounds were set according to the AMBER99 and
the AM1-BCC method, respectively. A crosslinker tethering rapamycin with an ATPcompetitive mTOR inhibitor was manually constructed and energy-minimized using the
MMFF94x force field in MOE to provide the initial conformation. The obtained initial
conformation was subjected to conformation search using LowModeMD in MOE (Iterative
limitation was set as 30). Values of potential energies (kcal/mol) of automatically created
conformation(s) were averaged.

Immunoblot analysis

The effect of the drug on cell proliferation was determined using a CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), which is based on
quantification of the cellular ATP level. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of
2,000–5,000 cells (8 replicates per condition). The following day, cells were treated with a
range of drug concentrations prepared by serial dilution. After 3–5 days of treatment, 100 ml
of prepared reagent was added to each well. The contents of the wells were mixed on a plate
shaker for 1 hour, and then luminescence was measured by an Analyst AD (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The relative growth was normalized to the untreated samples in
each group. The growth or inhibition curves and IC50 values were calculated with Graph
Pad Prism v.6.

Cells were washed with PBS once, disrupted on ice for thirty minutes in NP-40 (50 mM Tris
[pH 7.4], 1% NP-40, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 40 mmol/L NaF) or RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo
Scientific) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce Chemical) and
cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined with BCA reagent from
Pierce. Equal amounts of protein (10 to 50 µg) in cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE,

in Phoenix-AMPHO cells. The medium containing virus was filtered with 0.45 PVDF filters
followed by incubation with the target cells for 6 hours. The cells were then cultured in
virus-free medium for 2 days. The cells were selected with puromycin (2 µg/ml) or
hygromycin (500 µg/ml) for 3 days. The positive infected cell populations were further
sorted with transiently expressed GFP marker after being exposed to 1 µg/ml doxycycline
and the sorted positive cells were cultured and expanded in medium without doxycycline but

America) were implanted subcutaneously three days before tumor cell inoculation. Once
tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm3, mice were randomized (n= 5 mice per
group) to receive rapamycin (10 mg/kg), AZD8055 (75 mg/kg), RapaLink-1 (1.5 mg/kg) or
vehicle only as control. Sample size was chosen based on previous experiments. Rapamycin
was formulated in DMSO and delivered i.p., AZD8055 was formulated in 30% captisol, and
administered orally, RapaLink-1 was formulated in 6% DMSO and 30% captisol and
delivered by i.p. Mice treated with RapaLink-1 were also given saline s.c. injections
twice/day along with water supplemented with 5% glucose. Tumors were measured twice
weekly using calipers, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula: length × width2
× 0.52. Samples were lysed and processed as previously published29.

a, mTOR-FLAG Wild-Type (WT) and variants were transfected into 293H cells. Cells were
treated with rapamycin and lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-FLAG
antibody. mTORC1 complex formation was assessed by immunoblotting. b, 293H cells were
transfected and complex isolated as described in a, and an in vitro competition assay was
performed followed by immunoblotting. For gel source data, see Supplemental Figure 2. c,
Varying concentrations of AZD8055 were tested in vitro on WT and M2327I mTOR
followed by a kinase reaction (see Methods). The IC50s were determined by fitting to a
standard 4-parameter logistic using GraphPad Prism V.5. The diagram shows the mean of
n=3 data. The error bars represent the standard deviation between experiments. d, 293H cells
were transfected and the complex was isolated as described in a. An in vitro kinase assay
was performed and the level of P-AKT (S473) was determined by immunoblotting. Dots
represent on each curve the relative P-AKT at different time points. The kinase activity
curves were generated using Pad Prism v.6 after densitometry analysis was performed. All
experiments were repeated at least three times.

a, MDA-MB-468 cells inducibly expressing mTOR F2108L or M2327I (b) or F2108L/
M2327I mTOR double mutant (e) were treated as in Figure 3d and followed by
immunoblotting. For gel source data, see Supplemental Figures 4, 5 and 6. All experiments
were repeated at least three times. c, Mice bearing RR1 or TKi-R (d) xenograft tumors (n=5
for each group) were randomized to 4 different groups; (1) Vehicle (M, W, F); (2) rapamycin
(10 mg/kg; M, W, F); (3) AZD8055 (75 mg/kg; M, W, F); (4) RapaLink-1 (1.5 mg/kg;
weekly). Tumor size was measured by caliper two times per week. The results were reported
as tumor volume (mm^3) ± standard deviation.
