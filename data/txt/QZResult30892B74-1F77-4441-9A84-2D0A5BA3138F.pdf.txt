Abstract
ABT-737 targets Bcl-2/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1, which confers
resistance to this novel agent. Here, we summarize recent
findings indicating that Mcl-1 represents a critical determinant of ABT-737 sensitivity and resistance, and that Mcl-1
down-regulation by various pharmacologic agents or genetic
approaches dramatically increases ABT-737 lethality in diverse malignant cell types. These findings also show that the
multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak play important functional roles in ABT-737–mediated apoptosis, and that
Bak activation is essential in potentiation of ABT-737 lethality
by agents that down-regulate Mcl-1. Collectively, these findings
suggest a novel therapeutic strategy targeting multiple arms of
the apoptotic machinery. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):2908–11]

Cell survival is determined by the complex interplay between
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1/A1), which
display sequence homology in all BH1-BH4 domains, promote cell
survival, whereas proapoptotic proteins mediate receptor-, mitochondria-, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–dependent
apoptosis. The latter group is subdivided into multidomain or
BH3-only proteins. The former consists of Bax and Bak, which
are essential for apoptosis (1). The BH3-only proteins are further
divided into two subclasses: ‘‘activators’’ (e.g., Bim and tBid), which
directly activate Bax/Bak to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP; ref. 2), and ‘‘sensitizers/derepressors’’ (e.g., Bad, Bik, Bmf, Hrk, Noxa, and Puma), which do not
activate Bax/Bak directly but instead neutralize antiapoptotic
proteins (2, 3). The central role that Bax/Bak play in apoptosis is
supported by evidence that BH3-only proteins fail to trigger
apoptosis in Bax/Bak–deficient cells (4, 5). Antiapoptotic proteins
block death signaling by antagonizing the actions of Bax/Bak
through yet-to-be-defined mechanisms. As recently summarized
(6), antiapoptotic proteins prevent Bax/Bak activation by sequestering/inhibiting ‘‘activator’’ BH3-only proteins and/or directly
inhibiting Bax/Bak activation. ‘‘Sensitizer’’ BH3-only proteins displace ‘‘activator’’ BH3-only proteins from antiapoptotic proteins,
leading to Bax/Bak activation. Alternatively, BH3-only proteins
may directly neutralize/inhibit antiapoptotic proteins, releasing
their inhibition of Bax/Bak.
In human malignancies, increased expression of antiapoptotic
proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1) commonly occurs and is
associated with disease maintenance and progression, resistance to
chemotherapy, and poor clinical outcome. These findings have

prompted the development of anticancer strategies targeting such
proteins, including small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors (e.g., HA14-1;
ref. 7), antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (e.g., G3139; ref. 7), or BH3
peptidomimetics (8), among others. Recently, a novel Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/
Bcl-w inhibitor (ABT-737) has been developed, which in preclinical
studies markedly enhances the activity of chemotherapeutic agents
or ionizing radiation and displays impressive activity against
certain human tumors including follicular lymphoma, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in vitro
and in vivo (9). ABT-737 mimics the BH3-only protein Bad by
docking to the hydrophobic groove of antiapoptotic proteins,
thereby disabling their capacity to antagonize the actions of
proapoptotic proteins. ABT-737 is highly potent (i.e., at nanomolar
concentrations) in killing tumor cells displaying high levels of Bcl-2
and which are dependent upon Bcl-2 for survival (10). However,
ABT-737 exhibits a relatively low affinity for other antiapoptotic
proteins (e.g., Mcl-1 and A1; refs. 9, 11) and is considerably less
efficient in killing tumor cells expressing high Mcl-1 levels (10).
Although A1 is rarely expressed in tumor cells (11), Mcl-1 is
relatively highly expressed in various malignant cell types and may
theoretically limit the therapeutic effect of ABT-737 or related
agents. One plausible approach to this problem would be to
combine ABT-737 with agents capable of down-regulating/inhibiting nontargeted proteins, particularly Mcl-1, thereby circumventing
resistance (12).
Very recently, several groups (11, 13–15), including our own (16),
put this strategy into practice by reporting, almost simultaneously,
that Mcl-1 down-regulation by various means dramatically
enhances ABT-737 lethality in diverse human tumor cells. For
example, Konopleva et al. (13) and Chen et al. (16) observed that
the sensitivity of leukemia cells to ABT-737 correlated closely with
endogenous levels of Mcl-1 and/or the ratio of Bcl-2/Mcl-1.
Specifically, HL-60 cells, which exhibit low Mcl-1 but high Bcl-2
expression, were much more sensitive to ABT-737 than U937 and
OCI-AML3 cells displaying higher levels of Mcl-1. A similar
phenomenon was also noted in SCLC cells (15). To determine
whether Mcl-1 represents a critical factor conferring resistance to
ABT-737, van Delft et al. (11) and Chen et al. (16) showed that Mcl-1
overexpression in lymphoma cells (both in vitro and in vivo) or
leukemia cells largely diminished ABT-737 activity. Conversely,
knocking down Mcl-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA)/short
hairpin RNA dramatically increased ABT-737 sensitivity of epithelial tumor cells (e.g., HeLa and MCF-7; ref. 11), leukemia cells (e.g.,
U937 and OCI-AML3; ref. 13, 16), and SCLC cells (e.g., NCI-H196 and
NCI-H146; refs. 14, 15). This notion was confirmed by the
observation that Mcl-1 / mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF)
were exquisitely sensitive to ABT-737 (16). Finally, all five groups
used clinically relevant pharmacologic approaches to downregulate/inhibit Mcl-1. For example, van Delft et al., Konopleva et
al., and Tahir et al. showed that anticancer synergism between ABT737 and chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and carboplatin/etoposide) in all

likelihood reflected a reduction in Mcl-1 levels by p53-mediated
up-regulation of Noxa (11, 15), which binds to Mcl-1 and triggers
its proteasomal degradation. Konopleva et al. (13) also observed
that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 inhibitor
PD98059 synergistically enhanced ABT-737–induced apoptosis at
least in part by down-regulating Mcl-1 expression. This occurred
despite the fact that PD98059 also inhibited Bcl-2 phosphorylation,
which opposes the proapoptotic actions of ABT-737 by antagonizing its suppression of Bcl-2 dimerization with Bax. Moreover,
Lin et al. (14) showed that BAY43-9006 (sorafenib), originally
developed as a Raf inhibitor but subsequently found to downregulate Mcl-1 at the translational level, effectively overcame
ABT-737 resistance in SCLC cells. Chen et al. (16) primarily focused
on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, as such compounds,
including flavopiridol and CYC202 (Seliciclib), efficiently downregulate expression of the short-lived protein Mcl-1 at the
transcriptional level by inhibiting the CDK9/cyclin T, positive
transcription elongation factor-b complex. Specifically, CDK
inhibitors (e.g., roscovitine and R-roscovitine) markedly reduce
Mcl-1 expression by blocking Mcl-1 transcription via inhibition of
phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal domain of RNA polymerase
II, an event mediated by CDK9. Significantly, coadministration of
these agents synergistically potentiated ABT-737 lethality in human
leukemia cells including those ectopically expressing Bcl-2 or
Bcl-xL (16). Synergistic interactions between ABT-737 and other
CDK inhibitors (e.g., CYC202) were also reported by van Delft et al.
(11) and Lin et al. (14).
The question naturally arises how Mcl-1 down-regulation
enhances ABT-737 lethality. Initial studies focused on the roles of
the ‘‘activator’’ BH3-only protein Bim, inasmuch as Bim binds to
and is sequestered by multiple antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1). However, ABT-737 has been shown to enhance
imatinib-induced apoptosis in Bim knockout Bcr/Abl+ hematopoietic cells (17). Moreover, Konopleva et al. (13) reported that Bim
knockout did not diminish ABT-mediated apoptosis, although this
agent did disrupt the Bcl-2/Bim association. Together, these
findings argue against a major functional role for Bim in mediating
apoptotic signaling triggered by ABT-737. Moreover, Konopleva
et al. and Chen et al. noted that Bid, another ‘‘activator’’ BH3-only
protein that requires activated caspase-8 for processing into a
truncated (active) form (tBid), is also unlikely to be involved
because caspase-8 deficiency or transfection with a dominantnegative caspase-8 failed to modify ABT-737 lethality alone or in
combination with CDK inhibitors.
In view of these negative findings, attention focused on
multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, as their
activation leads directly to MOMP (1), a critical cell death
decision point (18, 19). Under normal conditions, Bax is localized
to the cytoplasm as a soluble monomeric protein but, upon
stimulation, undergoes a conformational change to an activated
form and translocates to mitochondrial and ER membranes. In
contrast, Bak resides in complexes on the mitochondrial and the
ER membrane in healthy cells. Following noxious stimuli, Bak
changes conformation to an active form. The active forms of both
Bax and Bak then form homooligomers, resulting in MOMP and
release of proapoptotic factors including cytochrome c, Smac/
Diablo, and AIF, thus triggering apoptosis. Konopleva et al. (13)
observed that ABT-737 induced Bax conformational change in
ABT-737–sensitive HL-60 cells probably by disrupting Bcl-2/Bax
heterodimerization by binding to Bcl-2, as ABT-737 does not
directly bind to Bax (11). This group also showed that Bax /

colon carcinoma cells (HCT116) were completely resistant to
ABT-737 even at high concentration (e.g., 10 Amol/L), whereas
knockdown of Bak by siRNA conferred partial resistance to this
agent. Van Delft et al. (11) found that ectopic expression of Noxa,
which triggers Mcl-1 degradation, sensitized wild-type MEFs to
ABT-737, whereas Bax/Bak double knockout MEFs were entirely
resistant. Moreover, killing of Noxa-expressing cells required either
Bax or Bak but was much more efficient in the presence of both
proteins. However, these studies did not address the functional
roles of Bax and particularly Bak in potentiation of ABT-737
lethality by Mcl-1 down-regulation.
Possible answers to these questions have emerged from recent
studies suggesting that multiple antiapoptotic protein cooperate to
sequester multidomain proapoptotic proteins and prevent their
activation. In particular, it has been reported that Bak is
sequestered by both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 (20).
Furthermore, apoptosis is fully induced only when Bak is released
from both Mcl-1 (i.e., through displacement by Noxa) and Bcl-xL
(i.e., through the actions of another proapoptotic BH3-only protein,
e.g., Bad). However, displacing Bak from either Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL is
relatively inefficient in triggering apoptosis because Bak remains
tethered to the other protein and thus inactive. To address the
roles of Bax and Bak activation in coordinately mediating the
lethality of simultaneous disruption of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1
axes, Chen et al. (16) used several approaches. First, they found
that ABT-737 alone triggered Bax conformational change in ABT737–resistant U937 cells, consistent with findings of Konopleva
et al. (13), but it failed to (a) induce Bak conformational change, a
marker of activation, or (b) Bax translocation to organellar
membranes. Konopleva et al. (13) noted that Bak associated
tightly with Mcl-1, an interaction that ABT-737 was unable to
disrupt. Moreover, the findings of Chen et al. indicate that the
capacity of CDK inhibitors (e.g., roscovitine) to potentiate ABT-737
lethality stems from cooperativity between these agents in
disrupting the association between Bak with Bcl-xL and Mcl-1,
respectively, resulting in pronounced Bak activation. Significantly,
this event was accompanied by a marked Bax conformational
change and translocation to the mitochondria. Notably, ectopic
expression of Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, blocked Bak activation
and diminished the interaction between roscovitine and ABT-737.
Furthermore, Mcl-1 / MEFs exhibited exquisite sensitivity to
ABT-737–mediated Bak activation, whereas roscovitine failed to
enhance ABT-737 lethality and Bak activation in such cells
presumably because Mcl-1 expression was already absent. Finally,
studies employing Bax / , Bak / , and double knockout MEFs
showed that Bax is necessary for the lethality of ABT-737 either
alone or in combination, whereas Bak is primarily required for
enhancement of ABT-737 lethality by roscovitine. Collectively,
these findings indicate that Mcl-1 down-regulation markedly
potentiates ABT-737 lethality through a mechanism involving
two distinct levels of cooperation between multidomain antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins: (a) simultaneous untethering
of Bak from Bcl-xL (by ABT-737) and Mcl-1 (e.g., by roscovitine)
and (b) the resulting activation of both Bax (i.e., conformational
change and translocation) and Bak. These findings suggest that
such pharmacologic approaches may mimic interactions between
more physiologic mediators of the apoptotic machinery, for
example, Noxa and Bad (20) whose capacity to release Bak from
Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are recapitulated by strategies targeting Mcl-1
(e.g., CDK inhibitors) and ABT-737, respectively. A model
summarizing these concepts is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. Mechanisms of potentiation of ABT-737 lethality by strategies targeting Mcl-1. Physiologic death stimuli act through signaling intermediaries (e.g., Noxa and
Bad) to trigger cell death pathways. ABT-737 mimics the actions of Bad by neutralizing Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, thus activating Bax and untethering Bak from Bcl-xL. However,
these events do not efficiently trigger apoptosis, particularly in cells with high levels of Mcl-1. In such cells, ABT-737 is unable to free Bak from Mcl-1 and to
activate Bak. On the other hand, Mcl-1 down-regulation by various pharmacologic agents recapitulates the more physiologic effects of Noxa in diminishing the
availability of Mcl-1. When pharmacologic agents that inhibit Bcl-2/Bcl-xL are combined with those that down-regulate Mcl-1, Bak is released from both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL
and activated. Activated Bak then cooperates with activated Bax (i.e., exhibiting conformational change and mitochondrial translocation) to evoke the apoptotic cascade.
Thus, compounds like ABT-737 and agents targeting Mcl-1 may cooperate at two related levels: (a ) simultaneous dissociation of Bak from Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL and
(b) activation of both Bax and Bak, thus mimicking the physiologic death process.

Notably, ABT-737 itself exhibits impressive anticancer effects
in vivo in murine tumor models (9, 11, 13), kills primary tumor
cells (e.g., acute myelogenous leukemia/AML; ref. 13) and AML
stem cells (13), and potentiates the activity of standard cytotoxic
agents (13). However, whereas it is tempting to propose strategies
in which ABT-737 or similar compounds are combined with
established agents, the significance of the studies described above
is that an alternative approach involving the rational combination of agents that trigger separate arms of the apoptotic
machinery deserves serious consideration. More specifically, these
newer findings suggest that pharmacologic agents targeting Mcl-1
may cooperate with agents targeting Bcl-2/Bcl-xL to mimic the
actions of more physiologic regulators of apoptosis, for example,
Noxa and Bad, which are normally activated under conditions
of stress (e.g., growth factor deprivation). Thus, by neutralizing
Mcl-1, which compensates for the loss of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL function,
barriers to apoptosis induction by agents such as ABT-737 are
effectively eliminated. In this way, it may be possible to
recapitulate, by pharmacologic means, the signaling events
responsible for activation of the apoptotic cascade that regularly

occur in normal cells. The recent introduction into the clinical
arena of agents potentially capable of down-regulating Mcl-1
expression could serve as an impetus for such efforts. Whether
such strategies will lead to enhanced therapeutic activity will
depend upon multiple factors, including the capacity of such
agents to diminish Mcl-1 expression in vivo and whether these
regimens selectively target transformed versus normal cells.
Notably, in all of the preclinical studies cited, ABT-737 and
compounds that down-regulated Mcl-1 expression were administered simultaneously. The effect of sequential administration of
these agents needs to be determined, as this could have
significant implications for the optimal translation of this
approach into the clinical arena. In any case, this promising
new strategy clearly warrants further attention.
