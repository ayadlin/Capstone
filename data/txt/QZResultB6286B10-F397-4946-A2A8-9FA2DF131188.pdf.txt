BACKGROUND: The axillary pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and the effect of axillary pCR on disease-free
survival (DFS) was determined in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and biopsy-proven axillary lymph node
metastases who were receiving concurrent trastuzumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The use of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is reported to result in pCR in the breast and axilla in up to 25% of patients. Patients achieving a pCR
have improved DFS and overall survival. To the authors’ knowledge, the rate of eradication of biopsy-proven axillary
lymph node metastases with trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens has not been previously
reported. METHODS: Records were reviewed of 109 consecutive patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and axillary metastases confirmed by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy who received trastuzumab-containing
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast surgery with complete axillary lymph node dissection. Survival was
evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinicopathologic factors and DFS were compared between patients with
and without axillary pCR. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (74%) achieved a pCR in the axilla. Axillary pCR was not
associated with age, estrogen receptor status, grade, tumor size, initial N classification, or median number of lymph
nodes removed. More patients with an axillary pCR also achieved a pCR in the breast (78% vs 25%; P < .001). At a
median follow-up of 29.1 months, DFS was significantly greater in the axillary pCR group (P ¼ .02). CONCLUSIONS:
Trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy appears to be effective in eradicating axillary lymph node metastases in the majority of patients treated. Patients who achieve an axillary pCR are reported to have improved DFS.

Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy is considered standard therapy for patients with locally advanced breast
cancer and patients with initially large tumors who desire breast-conserving therapy. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy
has not been shown to improve survival compared with conventional postoperative chemotherapy for patients with operable breast cancer,1 neoadjuvant chemotherapy does allow for in vivo evaluation of the response of the primary tumor and
metastatic lymph nodes to chemotherapy, and this response carries prognostic significance. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy

can produce a pathologic complete response (pCR) in
both the breast and axilla, and such a response has been
shown to correlate with improved disease-free and overall survival.1-3 In addition, as our group first reported,4
in patients with cytologically confirmed axillary metastases at diagnosis, pCR in the axilla alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, regardless of the primary tumor
response, also correlates with improved disease-free and
overall survival. In that study using the best available
systemic breast cancer agents, we reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in conversion to pathologically negative axillary lymph node status in 23% of
patients.4
Systemic agents for breast cancer are now targeted
toward specific subtypes and patients whose tumors overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) now routinely receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy
regimens containing trastuzumab. Studies have shown
that patients with pCR in both the breast and the axilla after treatment with trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy have improved disease-free survival.5-7
However, to the best of our knowledge, the incidence and
the prognostic significance of eradication of cytologically
confirmed axillary lymph node metastases by trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy have not
been reported to date. The evaluation of the regional
lymph node basins with ultrasonography and fine-needle
aspiration biopsy of suspicious-appearing lymph nodes
provides improved axillary staging over clinical examination alone. With this approach, nonpalpable axillary
lymph nodes can be more appropriately characterized
before the initiation of chemotherapy.8 Pathologic evaluation of the lymph nodes after chemotherapy can provide
an even better assessment of the effectiveness of trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens
when the pretreatment lymph node status has been clearly
defined. Ultimately, knowledge of the expected pCR rates
in the regional lymph nodes can help to guide the extent
and need for surgical management of the axillary lymph
nodes.
In this study, we examined the incidence and prognostic significance of the complete eradication of axillary
lymph node metastases and the clinicopathologic factors
associated with this finding in 109 consecutive patients.
Each patient had HER2-positive breast cancer and axillary
lymph node metastases confirmed by ultrasound-guided
fine-needle aspiration biopsy and received trastuzumabcontaining neoadjuvant chemotherapy at The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was reviewed and approved by The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional
Review Board and include patients treated between 2002
and 2008. Clinical and pathologic data from 109 consecutive patients identified from the prospectively entered
Breast Cancer Management System Database with
HER2-positive breast cancer and axillary metastases confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy were analyzed.
Each patient was required to have undergone trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by
breast surgery with complete axillary lymph node dissection at our institution. Overexpression of HER2/neu was
established using immunohistochemistry and confirmed
using fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Patients were evaluated before the initiation of preoperative chemotherapy by a multidisciplinary team to assess
the clinical stage of disease at presentation and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to assess response. The staging workup
included a complete history and physical examination, complete blood cell count, blood chemistry analysis, chest radiography, abdominal computed tomography or abdominal
ultrasonography, bone scan, bilateral mammography, and
bilateral ultrasonography of the breast and lymph node
basins. Mammography and ultrasonography were repeated
in the middle of the course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and again after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Patients received neoadjuvant therapy comprised of
concurrent trastuzumab in combination with other agents
(anthracycline-based [n ¼ 68] or non-anthracycline-based
[taxane-based, n ¼ 41]). After completion of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, patients underwent surgery for management of their breast cancer. The type of surgery performed
was at the discretion of the patient and surgeon. Twentyeight patients underwent segmental mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissections, whereas 81 underwent modified radical mastectomy.
The histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was characterized as a pCR in the breast if there was no
evidence of residual invasive tumor in the breast and as a
pCR in the axilla if there was no evidence of residual invasive tumor in the resected axillary lymph nodes. Axillary
lymph node status was determined on the basis of examination of a single hematoxylin and eosin-stained section from
each block of serially sectioned lymph nodes removed during surgery. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin was
performed when suspicious cells were identified.
All 28 patients who underwent breast-conserving
therapy received postoperative radiotherapy, as did 67 of

received tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor therapy after
completion of radiotherapy. In the later part of the study,
61 patients also received adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for
an additional 6 months, which had become the national
practice guideline.
For analysis, patients were divided into 2 groups:
those with and those without an axillary pCR. Data were
analyzed using SPLUS 8.0 and SAS statistical software
packages (version 9.1). Comparisons of the clinicopathologic characteristics of the groups were assessed by chisquare analysis. Overall survival was calculated from the
date of diagnosis, and disease-free survival was calculated from the date of surgery using the method of
Kaplan and Meier. The statistical significance level (P)
was taken as a measure of the strength of evidence
against the null hypothesis, and P .05 was considered
statistically significant.

RESULTS
Of the 109 patients in the study, overall 81 (74%)
achieved an axillary pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas 28 (26%) did not. There was no significant
difference in the rate of axillary conversion noted in
patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with
anthracycline chemotherapy versus those who received
trastuzumab without concurrent anthracycline (taxanebased) chemotherapy (76.8% and 70%; P ¼ 0.43; respectively). Of the 28 patients with residual axillary disease,
14 (50%) had residual disease in 1 lymph node only,
4 (14%) had residual disease in 2 lymph nodes, 5 (18%)
had residual disease in 3 lymph nodes, and 5 (18%) had
residual disease in 4 lymph nodes.

removed. However, patients with an axillary pCR were
more likely to have a pCR in the breast (78% vs 25%;
P < .001). In keeping with including all patients who had
documented positive axillary lymph node cytology and
who received trastuzumab-containing preoperative chemotherapy during the study period, there were 3 patients
with inflammatory carcinoma included within the cohort.
None of these patents had a pCR in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes.
The median follow-up for all patients in the study
was 29.1 months. In the axillary pCR group, there were
no locoregional recurrences; however, distant metastases
developed in 4 patients: 1 had lung metastases, 1 had both
liver and brain metastases, and 2 had brain metastases
only. In the group with residual axillary lymph node disease, 2 patients had brain metastases, 1 patient had bone
and liver metastases, 1 patient had brain metastases and a
chest wall recurrence, and 1 patient had an axillary lymph
node recurrence and lung metastases.
At the median follow-up, the disease-free survival
rate was significantly greater in the axillary pCR group
(93%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 86-99%) than
in the group with residual axillary lymph node disease
(76%; 95% CI, 61-95%) (P ¼ .02) (Fig. 1). There was no
difference in overall survival noted between the groups
(P ¼ .2), although there was a trend toward improved
overall survival in the axillary pCR group (Fig. 2). No significant differences in overall and disease-free survival
were noted with respect to regimen received (trastuzumab

Among patients with an axillary pCR, there was no
difference in disease-free survival between patients who
had residual disease in the breast and those who did not
(P ¼ .33), but again, there was a trend toward improved
overall survival in patients who had a pCR in both the
breast and the axilla (P ¼ .06).

DISCUSSION
The findings of the current study indicate that trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy eradicated
axillary lymph node metastases as assessed by standard histologic examination in 74% of patients with HER2-positive tumors with cytologically confirmed axillary disease.
There has been remarkable progress since our previously
published study (conducted before targeted therapies
were in use), which revealed a 23% axillary clearance rate
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally
advanced breast cancer and cytologically confirmed axillary disease.4 Our findings suggest that targeted therapies
not only lead to complete and partial responses in the primary tumor but are also highly effective in eradicating
metastatic disease in the regional lymph nodes.
Our findings also confirm the previously reported
finding that the response of the axillary lymph nodes in
patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy correlates directly with improvement in
the disease-free survival rates.9-12 In the current study,
with a median follow-up of only 29.1 months, patients

with negative axillary lymph nodes had a projected 4-year
disease-free survival rate of 93% (95% CI, 86-99%),
whereas patients with residual lymph node disease had a
projected 4-year disease-free survival rate of 76% (95%
CI, 61-95%) (P ¼ .02). A trend toward improved overall
survival for patients with axillary pCR was also noted,
although this was not yet statistically significant. Axillary
pCR was associated with an excellent prognosis, despite
the aggressive features of HER2-positive tumors.
The current study findings also suggest that the status of the axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is even more important than the amount of
residual disease in the breast. When we evaluated the outcome of patients with complete eradication of axillary
lymph node disease and stratified them based on pCR in
the breast or residual disease in the breast, there was no
difference noted with regard to disease-free survival
(P ¼ .33). However, longer follow-up is needed. Some
authors have suggested that residual tumor cells within
the breast may not have metastatic capability after chemotherapy treatment and that a pCR in the primary tumor
may carry prognostic significance because most of these
patients also achieve an axillary pCR.13
Our finding that 74% of patients had eradication of
axillary lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy suggests that it may be appropriate to omit axillary dissection in some patients with HER2-positive
breast cancers who receive a trastuzumab-based regimen.
Our current tools for identifying which patients have residual axillary disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are
not optimal. Axillary ultrasonography is superior to physical examination for detecting metastases, but small metastatic lymph nodes may be missed, and assessment can be
difficult after a patient has received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.8,14 An alternative to axillary lymph node dissection may be to have patients with clinically negative
axillae after neoadjuvant chemotherapy who are candidates for breast conservation be treated with an additional
radiation field to control subclinical axillary disease.15
In the current study, 50% of the patients with residual
axillary lymph node disease after trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy had only 1 positive
lymph node. In addition, no patient with an axillary
pCR developed a locoregional recurrence during the follow-up period. Patients who have a clinically negative
axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be candidates for nonsurgical management of the axilla. This,
however, would need to be examined with a prospective
randomized trial.

2888

Another alternative to axillary lymph node dissection is intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel
lymph node biopsy. The findings presented in the current
study suggest that it may be feasible to perform intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy
in patients with clinical complete response to trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients
treated with trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a 74% chance of achieving an axillary pCR,
and therefore complete axillary lymph node dissection
represents overtreatment for many of these patients. Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy is
increasingly being performed by surgeons in patients who
receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and present with an
initially clinically negative axilla to guide further therapy
of the axilla.16 However, there have been conflicting single-institution reports regarding the feasibility and accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in patients who present with initial biopsyproven axillary metastases.17-19 To address this issue, the
American College of Surgeons Oncology Group has just
opened a clinical trial (ACOSOG Z1071) to investigate
the accuracy of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph
node biopsy in patients who present with biopsy-proven
axillary lymph node metastasis and undergo neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. As better systemic agents are introduced
into the breast cancer armamentarium, it will be critically
important to develop minimally invasive and less morbid
surgical approaches to the axilla in patients treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
This specific study did not receive commercial sponsorship;
however, some patients in this study received drugs that were
paid by grants from the following companies: Genentech, Pfizer,
and Bristol Myers Squibb.
