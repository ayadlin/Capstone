Abstract
Elsewhere, we reported that multiple serial in vivo passage of a
squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC61) concurrent with
ionizing radiation (IR) treatment resulted in the selection of
radioresistant tumor (nu61) that overexpresses the signal
transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1)/IFNdependent pathway. Here, we report that (a) the Stat1 pathway
is induced by IR, (b) constitutive overexpression of Stat1 is
linked with failure to transmit a cytotoxic signal by radiation
or IFNs, (c) selection of parental cell line SCC61 against IFN-A
and IFN-; leads to the same IR- and IFN-resistant phenotype as
was obtained by IR selection, and (d) suppression of Stat1 by
short hairpin RNA renders the IR-resistant nu61 cells radiosensitive to IR. We propose a model that transient induction of
Stat1 by IFN, IR, or other stress signals activates cytotoxic
genes and cytotoxic response. Constitutive overexpression of
Stat1 on the other hand leads to the suppression of the
cytotoxic response and induces prosurvival genes that, at high
levels of Stat1, render the cells resistant to IR or other inducers
of cell death. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9214–20]

Introduction
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) is
primarily known as an important upstream regulator of IFN
signaling. On activation of IFN receptors, Stat1 is phosphorylated
at Tyr701 by IFN receptor-associated Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 1,
JAK2, and Tyk2 kinases and is translocated from the cytoplasm into
the nuclei (1, 2). In the nucleus, Stat1 binds to the cognate
transcriptional elements and activates IFN-inducible genes (3, 4).
Type I receptors responding to IFN-a and IFN-h activate the IFN
signaling gene factor 3 complex composed of Stat1, Stat2, and p48
[also known as IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) 9; see ref. 5]. Type II
receptors are specific to IFN-g and activate only Stat1, which forms
homodimers, enters the nucleus, and binds to IFN-g–activated
sequences, thereby inducing transcription of genes controlled by
IFN-g (6, 7). Stat1-induced genes do several functions, including
antiviral defense (8, 9). For example, 2¶-5¶-oligoadenylate synthase
activates RNase L, which induces degradation of double-stranded
RNA formed during viral replication and inhibits viral propagation
(10, 11). A second Stat1-dependent function is induction of cell
death and growth arrest both in the context of either a viral or a
stress response (12, 13). Known examples of genes controlled by

activated Stat1 in this pathway are IRF1, caspase-2, caspase-3,
caspase-7, Bcl2, and p21/Waf1 (14–16). The third function of Stat1 is
modulation of an immune response, mediated by activation
of MHC class I and II molecules and immune-related cytokines
(17, 18). Although Stat1 was discovered and described in the context
of IFN signaling, accumulating evidence indicates that it may
participate in other signaling cascades. In addition to the type I and
II IFN receptors, Stat1 may be activated by growth factor receptors,
such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), nonreceptor tyrosine
kinases, such as c-Abl (19), and seven-transmembrane receptors
(20). Recent data show that Stat1 can be activated by hypoxia/
reoxygenation in the myocardium, breast cancer, and endothelial
cells (21–23) as well as by EGF and erythropoietin (24, 25). However,
the outcome of Stat1 activation may be different depending on the
upstream signals (see refs. 8, 26). These data suggest that Stat1 is
involved in general stress response pathways and that functions of
Stat1-dependent pathways are not restricted by the IFN response
but rather have a much broader functional significance.
Previously, we reported that multiple serial in vivo passage
concurrent with ionizing radiation (IR) treatment of human
squamous cell carcinoma cells in nude mice resulted in the generation of a radioresistant tumor, which overexpresses IFN-stimulated
genes, including Stat1, and genes activated by Stat1 (27). Here, we
report that IR activates an IFN-inducible, Stat1-dependent pathway.
We also show that in vitro selection against IFN-a and IFN-g leads to
an IFN- and IR-resistant phenotype. Finally, we show that
suppression of Stat1 in tumor cells constitutively overexpressing this
pathway leads to radiosensitization. These results suggest that Stat1
may be potential target for radiosensitization of aggressive tumors
that constitutively overexpress the Stat1-dependent pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and reagents. All cell lines were maintained in DMEM/
F12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1%
hydrocortisone, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37jC, 100% humidity,
and 7% CO2. IFN-resistant cell lines were produced by serial passage of
SCC61 in increasing doses of IFN-a ( final concentration, 1,500 ng/mL; R&D
Systems) and IFN-g ( final concentration, 30 ng/mL; R&D Systems). IFN-a
resistance was quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and IFN-g resistance was
quantified by both MTS and clonogenic assays as described previously (28).
Immunoblots. Total cellular protein was extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors added (1 PBS, 1% NP40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 2 Ag/mL aprotinin,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All samples were normalized by
protein concentration using Bradford reagent and standard solution of
bovine serum albumin (1 mg/mL). Concentration of all samples was
adjusted to 1 mg/mL and equal amount of protein was loaded in each well.
For total Stat1 protein, we loaded 10 Ag of protein per well, and for

phosphorylated Stat1, we loaded 15 Ag of protein per well. Proteins were
separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. Total Stat1 was detected using the anti-Stat1 p84/p91 (E-23)
antibody. For loading control, we used antibodies for actin (I-19) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; FL-335). All antibodies were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Images were quantified with
ImageJ software4 by integration pixel values across the area of specific bands.
Real-time PCR analysis. cDNA was synthesized as described previously
(29). Primers are described in Supplementary Table S1. For the internal
control, we used GAPDH. PCR was done for 40 cycles at 95jC for 15 s and
60jC for 1 min after initial incubations at 50jC for 2 min and 95jC for
10 min using SYBR Green PCR reagent in ABI 7700 System (Applied
Biosystems). DCt values were calculated according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Fold induction relative to GAPDH was calculated as 2 DC t.
Fold induction of gene Xir in individual irradiated xenografts relative to
gene Xc in the control unirradiated xenografts was calculated as 2 (DDC tX),
where DCt values of all control xenografts were averaged. Number of
xenografts per each group varied from three to six.
Mouse xenografts studies. Xenografts were established by injection of
107 cells in 100 AL PBS into the right hind limb of 6-week-old female
athymic nude mice (Frederick Cancer Research Institute). Experiments
were conducted 2 to 3 weeks after injection when tumors reached an
average size of 200 to 400 mm3. For estimation of tumor sensitivity to antiIFN antibodies, each group of mice ( five animals per group) was irradiated
daily with six 5 Gy fractions. At the time of each irradiation, xenografts were
injected with a mixture of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-a, IFN-h, and
IFN-g (5 Ag/d each; R&D Systems). Relative tumor volume was measured
as described previously (30) and shown in the semilog scale. Data represent
mean values for each group of mice with error bars for SE. For estimation of
nu61 radiosensitivity after transfection by Stat1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA),
we used eight animals per group. Xenografts were grown and irradiated as
described above. For transcriptional response, xenografts of cell lines
indicated in Fig. 2 were established in nude mice, grown to the average size
of 400 mm3, and subjected to fractionated irradiation with four 5 Gy
fractions daily. Twenty-four hours after IR, tumor animals were sacrificed,
tumors were excised, and RNA was purified based on Trizol technique as
described previously (29), except column purification. Each point represents
from three to six individual xenografts. Experiments were conducted in
accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Chicago.
Irradiation of cells and animals. Irradiation was done using a Philips
RT250 X-ray generator with dose rate 1.65 Gy/min.
Transfection of cells with Stat1 shRNA. To establish SCC61 and nu61
cell lines stably transfected by shRNA to human Stat1, we used pSIRENRetroQ-DsRed-Express retroviral vector with inserted Stat1 shRNA
sequence (5¶-gatccGAAAGAACTTTCTGCTTGTTTTCAAGAGAAACAGCAGAAAGTTCTTTCTTTTTTGCTAGCg-3¶). This vector together with control
vector (L4) was kindly provided by Dr. Elizabeth Quinn and Baz Smith
(Clontech). Vectors were packed using pantropic packaging system
(Clontech) with GP-293 as packaging cell line and cotransfection with
pVSV-G according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were grown in
the collagen-coated six-well plates (BioCoat, Becton Dickinson), and
supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and used for infection
of SCC61 and nu61. Cycles of infection were repeated twice at the presence
of 4 Ag/mL polybrene (Sigma), and infected cells were collected by cell
sorting using DakoCytomation MoFlo-HTS cell sorter. Infected cells were
maintained in the same medium as the parental cell lines.
Transfected cell lines are designated as S1L4 (SCC61 control), S1shS
(Stat1 shRNA), N1L4 (nu61 control), and N1shS (Stat1 shRNA).
Detection of the cytotoxic response in transfected cell lines. Because
transfected cells were labeled by DsRed protein, we used fluorescent
microscopy and YO-PRO-1 green fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes) for
detection of dead cells. Cells were plated in the 96-well clear-bottom plates
(Costar) in triplicates in concentration 16,000 per well and, 18 h later,

irradiated at 5 Gy. Forty-eight hours after IR, cells were treated by YO-PRO-1
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and incubated at room temperature for 48 h and images were captured using fluorescent microscopy.
For that, we used Olympus 1X81 wide-field fluorescence microscope with
Retiga EXi digital charge-coupled device camera. Green fluorescence was
detected with 480 nm exciter/535 nm emission filter, and red fluorescence
was detected with band pass 530 nm exciter/590 nm long-pass emission
filter. Images were captured with 100 and 200 magnification, and green
and red images were overlaid using MetaMorph 6.1 software (Universal
Imaging Corp.). Five fields containing at least 100 cells for each control and
the treated group were captured at 100 magnification and used for
scoring of the cell death. Scoring was based on estimation of the percent
of dead (green) to alive (red) cells in each field, calculated as N(green) /
N(red)  100. Control values were subtracted from values after treatment
and presented as increase of the dead cells relative to control (%).
Significance of differences was estimated using paired two-tailed t test.

Results
IR induces expression of Stat1 and Stat1-dependent IFNstimulated genes. Earlier, we reported that multiple serial in vivo
passage concurrent with IR treatment of a human tumor results in
the selection of radioresistant tumor designated nu61 (27). DNA
arrays and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) data
showed that in nu61 Stat1 was up-regulated on the transcriptional
level 4.1-fold compared with SCC61 (27). Western blot analysis
showed a 5.2-fold overexpression of Stat1 protein in nu61 tumors
compared with SCC61 tumors (data not shown), indicating that upregulation of Stat1 occurs on both transcriptional and translational
levels. In established cell lines, we detected a 2.4-fold increase in
Stat1 basal expression in nu61 cells compared with SCC61 cells (see
Fig. 1A and B, time 0). These results showed that the constitutive
overexpression of Stat1 in nu61 tumors is retained in nu61 cells.
We next asked if exposure to IR up-regulates Stat1 expression.
The results presented in Fig. 1A and B show that in both cell lines
IR leads to up-regulation of the Stat1 protein. In SCC61, this upregulation reached 2.5-fold at 36 h after IR compared with
untreated controls. In nu61, this up-regulation reached 4.5-fold at
36 h and increased to 5.2-fold by 48 h. In a second series of
experiments, we tested the hypothesis that IR also activates
downstream genes targeted by Stat1. Genes used by us in these
experiments (IFIT1, IFIT3, IFITM1, MX1, and OASL) have been
previously described as coexpressed with Stat1 and/or directly
activated by Stat1 (31–33). We analyzed the expression of these
genes in tumor xenografts representing seven cell lines
corresponding to the four types of cancer, including head and
neck, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer (see Fig. 1C).
The results show that IR induced up-regulation of Stat1 and Stat1dependent genes in all tumor xenografts, except HCT116 colorectal
cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). We conclude
that IR induces Stat1 and downstream Stat1-activated/IFNstimulated genes in multiple human tumors and is not restricted
to the SCC61 cell line we used in our initial selection.
Constitutive overexpression of the Stat1 pathway induces
resistance to IR and IFNs. Next, we tested the hypothesis that
radioresistance is mediated by a constitutive overexpression of the
Stat1-dependent pathway and is associated with resistance to IFNs.
In these experiments, mice bearing SCC61 tumors were treated
with neutralizing antibodies to IFN-a, IFN-h, and IFN-g with and
without IR ( four 5 Gy fractions to a total dose of 20 Gy). Anti-IFN
antibodies enhanced regrowth of irradiated SCC61 tumors by day
28 (doubling time reduced from 14.5 F 0.36 to 10.4 F 0.80 days;
P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). In contrast, anti-IFN antibodies had no effect on

the regrowth of nu61 tumors (Fig. 2B). These results show that, in
parental SCC61 tumors, radiosensitivity can be modulated by IFNs.
This tumor is sensitive to IFNs without IR treatment. In contrast,
nu61 tumors are resistant to IFNs and its radioresistance cannot be
modulated by IFNs.
To test if this phenotype persists in vitro, we compared sensitivity
of nu61 and SCC61 cell lines to IFN-a and IFN-g. Figure 3A shows
that nu61 cells are more resistant compared with SCC61 cells to
IFN-g at all concentrations tested. At a concentration of IFN-g of
100 ng/mL (1,000 units/mL), differences in resistance were 1.8-fold
(P = 0.000123). IFN-a was less cytotoxic to both types of tumor cells.
However, at concentrations of IFN-a equal to 25 and 50 ng/mL
(7,000 and 14,000 units/mL, respectively), we observed small but
significant differences between nu61 and SCC61 (P = 0.056 and
0.00022, respectively). These concentrations are marked by asterisks
in Fig. 3A. Taken together, these results show that radioresistant
nu61 is also more resistant to IFN-a and IFN-g compared with
SCC61 both in vivo (see Fig. 2) and in vitro (see Fig. 3A). These
results indicate that the association between overexpression of
Stat1 and combined resistance to IR and IFNs persists in vitro. To
confirm a direct role of Stat1 in both IFN and IR resistance, we
investigated clones of SCC61 transfected either by a full-size cDNA
for Stat1a or empty vector control, MT4. These clones were
described by us previously and showed 2-fold overexpression of
Stat1 in transfected clones relative to MT4 and SCC61 (27). In these
experiments, we used a clonogenic assay and fitted curves to the
linear quadratic model (34). The results were highly significant, with
R 2 values for MT4 and Stat1 clones of 0.9929 and 0.9957, respectively. This allowed us to estimate D 0 values for both clones,
using data of three independent experiments, presented in Fig. 3B.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

These values were equal to 1.12 F 0.228 for MT4 and 1.80 F 0.245
for Stat1 clone (P = 0.0011). Therefore, mock-transfected and Stat1transfected SCC61 cells are significantly different and similar to
relatively radiosensitive or relatively radioresistant tumor cell lines
described previously (35). These results indicate that stable transfection of parental SCC61 cells by a full-size Stat1 confers resistance
to both IR and IFNs (see Fig. 3B and C) and recapitulates the
phenotype observed by us in in vivo studies (see Fig. 2 and ref. 27).
Cells selected to IFN resistance are also radioresistant. To
test whether IFN-resistant cells are also resistant to IR, the parental
IR- and IFN-sensitive SCC61 cells were serially passaged in medium
containing increasing doses of IFNs from 5 to 30 ng/mL for IFN-g
and 1,500 ng/mL for IFN-a (see Materials and Methods). Three IFNa–resistant clones (aR1, aR5, and aR8) and three IFN-g–resistant
clones (gR8, gR9, and gR13) were chosen as the most resistant (see
Materials and Methods). At an IFN-a concentration of 1,500 ng/mL,
all three clones selected against IFN-a were significantly more
resistant than the parental line SCC61 as measured by MTS assay
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4A). The IFN-g–resistant clones were tested in MTS
and clonogenic assays. The results of the clonogenic assay (Fig. 4B)
show that the IFN-g–selected clones were 40- to 74-fold more
resistant than SCC61. Clonogenic survival analyses done on the six
IFN-resistant clones following exposure to 3 or 7 Gy revealed a
significant increase in radiation resistance compared with SCC61.
For the IFN-a–resistant clones exposed to 3 Gy, the surviving
fraction was 50% to 60% greater than SCC61 (P < 0.008; see
Fig. 5A). At 7 Gy, the differences in surviving fractions were
between 1.7- and 3.2-fold (P < 0.002). For IFN-g–resistant clones
gR8, gR9, and gR13 at 3 Gy, the increase in the surviving fraction
compared with SCC61 varied from 40% to 68% (P < 0.006). At 7 Gy,

Dual Function of Stat1 in Tumor Cells

Stably transfected cell lines (see Materials and Methods) analyzed
for Stat1 expression by Western blot analysis (see Fig. 6A) showed
that the levels of Stat1 decreased 59% in nu61 and 34% in SCC61
relative to a control vector. In the subsequent experiments, we
focused on nu61 cells to investigate the relationships between Stat1
overexpression and radioresistance. To detect the potential effects

Figure 2. Radioresistant tumor nu61 is also resistant to anti-IFN antibodies
in vivo . Radiosensitive SCC61 (A ) and radioresistant nu61 (B) flank xenografts in
nude mice were irradiated (5 Gy) daily for 6 d in the presence or absence of a
mixture of neutralizing antibodies (Ab) to IFN-a, IFN-h, and IFN-g (5 ng/d) given
at time of irradiation. Points, mean values for each group of mice; bars, SE.

the differences between SCC61 and IFN-g–resistant clones ranged
between 2- and 3-fold (P < 0.002; see Fig. 5B). Western blot analyses
revealed an overexpression of Stat1 in IFN-a–resistant and IFN-g–
resistant clones that ranged from 2.0- to 3.5-fold relative to SCC61
using normalization to GAPDH (see Fig. 5C and D). Therefore, all
clones selected for IFN resistance overexpressed Stat1 and were
also IR resistant compared with the parental cell line SCC61.
Suppression of Stat1 expression reverses tumor radioresistance. Our data indicated that constitutively overexpressed Stat1
leads to resistance to cytotoxic responses of IR and IFNs. To
investigate whether suppression of Stat1 leads to radiosensitization, we designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence Stat1
(si-178). This siRNA suppressed Stat1 mRNA 5.5-fold based on
QRT-PCR. Transient transfection with si-178 did not affect
the growth and survival of SCC61 cells but significantly (72%;
P = 0.0007) suppressed nu61 survival (as measured by MTS assay;
see Materials and Methods) compared with cells transfected with
control ‘‘scrambled’’ siRNA against GAPDH (data not shown). These
findings suggest that nu61 survival depends at least in part on
constitutive overexpression of Stat1. To investigate the effects of
Stat1 suppression in more detail, we used shRNA to establish
SCC61 and nu61 clones stably transfected by Stat1 shRNA.

of Stat1 suppression on radioresistance, mock-transfected (N1L4)
and shRNA-transfected (N1shS) nu61 cell lines were irradiated with
5 Gy and, 48 h after IR, analyzed for the appearance of apoptotic/
necrotic cells (see Materials and Methods). Data presented in Fig. 6B
and C show that transfection of the shRNA Stat1 constructs into the
nu61 cells (N1shS) and irradiation with 5 Gy lead to 6.6-fold increase
of the cell death compared with control N1L4 cells with significance
of 0.006. We concluded that suppression of Stat1 in nu61 results in
radiosensitization of these cells in vitro.
To test whether radiosensitization of nu61 can be observed
in vivo, we established xenografts of N1L4 and N1shS cells in
athymic nude mice as described in Materials and Methods.
Xenografts were grown to 200 mm3, irradiated, and measured as
described previously (see Materials and Methods and ref. 27). The
results show that without irradiation N1shS tumors proliferate at a
lower rate compared with N1L4 tumors (see Fig. 6D). However, the
most striking differences were obtained by comparison of
irradiated N1L4 and N1shS tumors. By day 10, the average relative
volume of irradiated N1L4 was 1.41 F 0.17, whereas N1shS tumors
were significantly smaller (0.93 F 0.36; P = 0.0044). Thus, anti–
Stat1-transfected cells (N1shS) were 1.5-fold more sensitive to
irradiation compared with mock-transfected counterparts. By day
14, differences increased by 1.8-fold (P = 0.004). We concluded that
suppression of Stat1 in tumors overexpressing this protein leads to
radiosensitization. The results from in vitro and in vivo experi-

ments indicate that Stat1 represents a potential target for tumor
radiosensitization.

Discussion
In an earlier article, we reported that serial in vivo passage of
squamous cell carcinoma concurrent with IR resulted in the
selection of a population of tumor cells that overexpressed Stat1and IFN-inducible genes and that the tumor cells exhibited
significant levels of resistance to IR compared with the parental
cells (27). These findings raised two key questions. First, does IR
induce overexpression of Stat1 in tumor cells, and is this phenomenon unique to squamous cell carcinoma or is this a common
property of irradiated tumor cells? In this report, we show that
induction of Stat1 by IR is a common albeit not a general response
of irradiated tumor cells. The second question arising from these
data is the role of Stat1 in the development of radiation resistance.
Is overexpression of Stat1 a necessary step in the development of
resistance to IR or is it a response that is concurrent but not actually
related to the development of resistance to IR?
With respect to the first question, two lines of experiments
indicate that induction of Stat1 is a common albeit not a general
response to IR. In this report, we show that IR induced Stat1
activation in both SCC61 and the radiation-resistant, Stat1overexpressing nu61 cells (Fig. 1A and B). Our findings are
consistent with those of Amundson et al. (36) who showed that

subjected to fractionated irradiation (six 5 Gy; total dose, 30 Gy). Last dose
was delivered at day 8 and final measurements were done at day 14 after
beginning of irradiation. P value was estimated by an unpaired two-tailed t test.

whole-body irradiation leads to the up-regulation of Stat1 and
several Stat1-dependent genes in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Jen
and Cheung (37) reported that irradiation of lymphoblastoid cell
lines leads to the up-regulation of Stat1-dependent genes, which
partially overlap with genes, described by us previously (27).
Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 1C, Stat1- and IFN-inducible genes
were induced in tumors derived from colon cancer, head and neck
cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer cells. Up-regulation of
Stat1 is readily apparent from QRT-PCR studies of human tumors.
We may conclude that Stat1 and the IFN-dependent pathway are
up-regulated in a large fraction of diverse human tumors in
response to IR.
The second question relates specifically to the role of Stat1 in the
development of resistance to IR. Because both SCC61 and nu61 cell
cultures secrete IFNs (data not shown), to evaluate the role of IFN in
the expression of cytotoxic genes, we tested the growth of SCC61 or
nu61 in mouse xenografts treated with anti-IFN antibody. The

www.aacrjournals.org

results unambiguously showed that anti-IFN antibody enabled
SCC61 to grow faster but that the antibody had no effect on nu61
cells (Fig. 2). We can deduce from this experiment that the secreted
IFN has a positive therapeutic effect associated with the induction
of cytotoxic genes in SCC61 but that this response is not operative in
nu61 cells. In these cells, the cytotoxic effects of IFN-inducible
genes are blocked and this suppression is also retained in vitro
(Fig. 3A). In the tumors adapted to continuous exposure to IFNs,
Stat1 is overexpressed, and the expected cytotoxic response
following exposure to IR or IFNs is also blocked (Figs. 4 and 5).
These observations are consistent with published data about
overexpression of IFN/Stat1-dependent pathway in primary breast
and lung tumors (31, 38). These results suggest that constitutive
expression of the cytotoxic Stat1 pathway leads to the selection of
tumor clones resistant to the Stat1-dependent cytotoxicity and
formation of aggressive tumor clones resistant to IFNs and IR.
Although our data show cross-talk between IR- and IFN-inducible
pathways and involvement of IFN signaling in the formation of
radioresistance, other reports suggest that the Stat1-dependent
pathway can be up-regulated by various signaling systems. For
example, Pedersen et al. (24) described an ability of ligand-activated
EGFR to induce Stat1-dependent genes, which significantly overlapped with the gene pattern we previously reported (27). Jechlinger
et al. (39) showed that formation of autocrine PDGF/PDGFR signaling
promotes mammary cancer metastasis and involves activation of
Stat1. Recent data also show that Stat1 can be activated by erythropoietin (25) and hypoxia (21–23). These data suggest that activation of the Stat1 pathway has more broad significance compared
with its traditional link to IFN signaling. Perhaps IFNs and IR may act
in concert with other factors of the tumor microenvironment, such
as EGF and PDGF. Further experiments are necessary to dissect the
role of different signaling systems potentially leading to the
constitutive activation of the Stat1-dependent pathway.
The second key experiment was the suppression of Stat1 in nu61
cells with shRNA. Our data show that in this instance we observed
that nu61 cells became IR sensitive concurrent with the decrease in
the accumulation of Stat1 protein (see Fig. 6A–D).
Based on these data, we propose that Stat1 has a dual function. At
levels of activity associated with radiosensitive tumor cells
(as SCC61), activation of Stat1 leads to the activation of cytotoxic
genes and, ultimately, cell death. At high constitutive levels of Stat1
expression observed in nu61 cells and clones transfected by Stat1 (Fig.
3B and C) or selected against IFN-a and IFN-g (Figs. 4 and 5), Stat1
activates and maintains the expression of prosurvival genes with
simultaneous suppression of cytotoxic effects (Figs. 2 and 3). This
may explain the observed switch from proapoptotic to prosurvival
functions of Stat1, which is shown by knockdown experiments in
nu61 both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6A–D). Indeed, currently, Stat1 is
reported to control essential prosurvival genes, such as MCL-1 (40),
IFITM1, or Leu-13 (41), multidrug resistance vault proteins (42), and
USP18 (UBP43), which mediates protection from IFN-induced
cytotoxicity (43). Importantly, we previously reported that MCL-1,
IFITM1, and USP18 are coexpressed with Stat1 in the IR- and IFNresistant nu61 tumor (27). Consistent with our observations are recent
reports, which indicate that constitutive overexpression of Stat1 and
Stat1-dependent genes is associated with protection of tumor cells
from genotoxic stress following treatment with fludarabine (44),
doxorubicin (45), cis-platinum (46), and the combination of IR and
doxorubicin (47, 48). The balance between prosurvival and cytotoxic
functions of Stat1 may be analogous to the differing effects of tumor
necrosis factor superfamily ligands and transforming growth factor-h

on cell growth and death, whereby the outcome of these opposing
effects depends on cellular context and environmental factors (49–51).
The most significant finding that bears directly on our model is
that suppression of Stat1 accumulation renders the tumor more
sensitive to IR. Our data predict that suppression of Stat1 levels in
patients overexpressing this protein may lead to a significant
benefit to cancer patients undergoing IR therapy.

Addendum
After this manuscript was submitted, Tsai et al. published
observations that ionizing radiation induces IFN-related genes
including Stat1, Ifit1, Ifitm1, Oas1, and Mx1 in glioma, breast, and

prostate cancer cell lines (52), which is consistent with our current
data and explanation of nu61 selection by fractionated IR.
