SHORT COMMUNICATION

H3K9me3 facilitates hypoxia-induced p53-dependent
apoptosis through repression of APAK
MM Olcina1, KB Leszczynska1, JM Senra1, NF Isa1, H Harada2 and EM Hammond1
Regions of hypoxia occur in most solid tumors, and they are associated with a poor prognostic outcome. Despite the absence of
detectable DNA damage, severe hypoxia (o 0.1% O2) induces a DNA damage response, including the activation of p53 and
subsequent induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. Factors affecting hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis are unclear. Here
we asked whether H3K9me3, through mediating gene repression, could regulate hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis.
Under hypoxic conditions, increases in H3K9me3 occur in an oxygen-dependent but HIF-1-independent manner. We demonstrate
that under hypoxic conditions, which induce p53 activity, the negative regulator of p53, APAK, is repressed by increases in
H3K9me3 along the APAK loci. APAK repression in hypoxia is mediated by the methyltransferase SETDB1 but not Suv39h1 or G9a.
Interestingly, increasing hypoxia-induced H3K9me3 through pharmacological inhibition of JMJD2 family members leads to an
increase in apoptosis and decreased clonogenic survival and again correlates with APAK expression. The relevance of
understanding the mechanisms of APAK expression regulation to human disease was suggested by analysis of patients with
colorectal cancer, which demonstrates that high APAK expression correlates with poor prognosis. Together, these data demonstrate
the functional importance of H3K9me3 in hypoxia, and they provide a novel mechanistic link between H3K9me3, p53 and
apoptosis in physiologically relevant conditions of hypoxia.

INTRODUCTION
Tumor hypoxia arises in the majority of solid tumors as a
consequence of high metabolic demand for oxygen and rapid
growth coupled to the inefﬁciency of new blood vessels formed
by angiogenesis.1 The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are typically
regarded as the main drivers of the hypoxic response.2 Although
HIF can be induced in relatively mild levels of hypoxia, severe
levels of hypoxia (o0.1% O2) are required to induce a DNA
damage response, the downstream effect of which is p53
activation.3 In response to severe hypoxia, replication stress
occurs, leading to increased activity of both ATR and ATM, which
in turn phosphorylate p53 at serine 15 leading to increased p53
stability/activity and the subsequent induction of p53-dependent
apoptosis.4–6 Activation of the DNA damage response has been
proposed to contribute to an early barrier to tumorigenesis by
inducing p53-mediated senescence or apoptosis.7,8 Hypoxia
therefore drives the selection pressure for mutation of p53 or
inactivation of the p53 pathway.9
In unstressed conditions, p53 protein is kept at low levels
through proteasomal degradation, but it can be rapidly stabilized
and activated in response to a wide variety of stresses. In addition,
the activity and function of low constitutive levels of p53 are
subject to further levels of control. APAK (ATM and p53-Associated
KZNF Protein/ZNF420) encodes a KZNF protein that binds to p53
through its KRAB domain in unstressed cells.10 APAK binding
attenuates acetylation of p53 by recruiting KAP-1-HDAC1 complexes, and it negatively regulates p53. Upon DNA damage, ATMdependent phosphorylation of p53, KAP-1 and APAK results in

dissociation of the APAK-p53 complex, favoring the transcriptional
activation of proapoptotic genes by p53.11 In addition, APAK can
prevent p53 from binding to the proapoptotic gene p53AIP1 by
binding to a consensus sequence (TCTTN2 − 30TTGT) overlapping
the p53-binding site.12
The regulation of chromatin structure is essential for a number of
nuclear processes including transcription, replication and repair.
Histones, for example, can be heavily post-translationally modiﬁed,
leading to changes toward a generally repressive or activating state
depending on the modiﬁcation and the residue targeted.13
H3K9me3 is typically associated with heterochromatin and gene
repression, whereas H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 are mostly found in
euchromatic regions.14,15 Regulation of H3K9 methylation is
catalyzed by a number of histone methyltransferases and removed
by demethylases. The main H3K9 methyltransferases include
Suv39h1, Suv39h2, G9a, GLP/EuHMTase1 and SETDB1/ESET.16–18
The development of speciﬁc inhibitors to each of the H3K9me3
methyltransferases has proven to be challenging to date; however,
levels of this mark can be modulated through pharmacological
inhibition of the relevant demethylases.19 ML324 is a recently
described inhibitor, which leads to increased histone methylation,
including H3K9me3, through inhibition of the JMJD2 enzymes.
ML324 exhibits inhibitory activity against JMJD2E in the submicromolar range, and it has demonstrated efﬁcacy at reducing human
cytomegalovirus, as well as herpes simplex infection.19
Increases in H3K9me3 and decreases in H3K9 acetylation have
been reported in a number of cell lines exposed to hypoxia with the
subsequent repression of a number of different genes, including

demonstrated that under hypoxic conditions H3K9me3 enrichment
increases along the APAK loci leading to gene repression in a
SETDB1-dependent manner. The biological consequence of
decreased levels of APAK is an increase in p53-dependent hypoxiainduced apoptosis. Most importantly, we show that increased
H3K9me3 levels, decreased APAK expression and apoptosis can
result from pharmacological inhibition of the JMJD2 demethylase.

APAK expression correlates with poor prognosis
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
APAK and p53-mediated apoptosis
We hypothesized that APAK overexpression would lead to a
decrease in apoptosis under hypoxic conditions and that this
would occur in a p53-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis,
we overexpressed APAK in both HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/isogenic cell lines and exposed them to o0.1% O2. As expected,
HCT116 p53+/+ underwent apoptosis in response to hypoxia,
whereas this was diminished in the p53-/- cells. As predicted, APAK
overexpression signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of hypoxiainduced p53-dependent apoptosis (Figure 1a and Supplementary
Figure S1a). We also found that APAK overexpression led to a
reduction in the number of apoptotic cells in the RKO (p53+/+) cell
line (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1b). We then carried
out the reciprocal experiment and used siRNA to reduce APAK
levels in both normoxia and hypoxia (o 0.1% O2). Decreased

expression of APAK was veriﬁed, and it led to a signiﬁcant increase
in apoptosis (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1c). Together,
these data demonstrate that APAK expression correlates with
hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis. Notably, the relevance of APAK expression to human disease was suggested by
analysis of a small set of patients with colorectal cancer, which
demonstrates that high APAK expression correlates with poor
overall survival (Figure 1d).
APAK is repressed in hypoxia
Given the observed role for APAK in inhibiting p53-dependent
apoptosis, we speculated that APAK expression in hypoxia should
be tightly regulated.11 Therefore, we assessed APAK protein levels
under different oxygen tensions. We noted a marked reduction in
protein expression after exposure to severe hypoxia (o0.1% O2),
whereas no reduction in protein expression was observed
following exposure to milder hypoxic conditions. The oxygen
dependency of APAK repression correlated with the levels of
oxygen that also lead to p53 activity (Figure 2a). Next, we
examined the oxygen dependency of APAK mRNA expression by

exposing RKO cells to o 0.1 or 2% O2 for the times indicated.
APAK mRNA expression was repressed at o 0.1% O2 but not in the
milder hypoxic conditions (Figures 2b and c).
We tested whether HIF-1 could be regulating APAK expression,
and found that neither HIF-1α nor HIF-1β appeared to have a role
in regulating APAK expression under o 0.1% O2 (Supplementary
Figures S2a–d). Epigenetic regulation is an other important
mechanism of gene expression regulation in hypoxia.6 Given that
we had found that APAK was repressed in an HIF-1-independent
manner in hypoxia, we decided to check whether chromatin
repressive marks such as H3K9me3 were reported as enriched
along the APAK loci. Using the UCSC genome browser (GRCh37/
hg19 genome assembly), we found an enrichment of the
H3K9me3 chromatin mark along the APAK gene. Interestingly,
we also found a large proportion of the APAK gene correlating
with regions associated with heterochromatin as assessed by
computationally integrating ChIP-seq data using a Hidden Markov
Model24 (Figure 2d). This suggested that APAK is in a region of
relatively inaccessible chromatin, and we subsequently veriﬁed
this by EpiQ analysis (Supplementary Figure S2e). Importantly, this
analysis demonstrated that the degree of chromatin compaction
increased in response to hypoxia. Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR analysis
of the APAK loci showed marked enrichment of H3K9me3
speciﬁcally in hypoxia ( o0.1% O2), using two different sets of
primers. Notably, this enrichment was decreased following
reoxygenation mirroring the global changes in this histone mark
previously assessed by western blotting (Figures 2e and f).6 ChIP
analysis of a control region displaying minimal H3K9me3 on the
UCSC browser proﬁle, as expected, showed minimal H3K9me3
enrichment in normoxia, hypoxia and reoxygenation (Figure 2g).
The observed speciﬁc transcriptional repression of APAK in
response to o0.1% O2 was consistent with the oxygendependent regulation of H3K9me3, supporting the hypothesis
that this histone modiﬁcation is involved in repressing APAK. As
p53 has recently been linked to H3K9me3 regulation, we
investigated a potential role for p53 in the hypoxia induction of
H3K9me3.25 siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 had no effect on
the hypoxic induction of H3K9me3 (Figure 2h). In support of the
importance of H3K9me3 in APAK regulation in hypoxia, repression
of APAK remained unchanged upon p53 loss.
SETDB1 is involved in mediating APAK repression in hypoxia
To understand the mechanism of APAK regulation further, we
investigated the regulation of H3K9 methyltransferases under
different oxygen tensions. H3K9me3 levels were induced in an
oxygen-dependent manner in response to hypoxia (Figure 3a).6
The oxygen-dependent regulation of H3K9me3 appeared to be
HIF-1α independent. The increase in H3K9me3 in hypoxia did not
correlate with an obvious increase in expression of the
methyltransferases (SETDB1, Suv3h1/2 and G9a), although SETDB1
was moderately increased at the protein level in response to
o0.1% O2 (Figure 3a). As expected, the mRNA expression of
SETDB1, Suv39h2 and G9a was found to be HIF-1/2 independent
(Supplementary Figures S3a and b).
The region of hypoxia-induced H3K9me3 enrichment chosen for
ChIP-qPCR analysis (Figure 2e) also showed binding of SETDB1
(Supplementary Figure S3c). To test the involvement of this
methyltransferase in mediating APAK repression in hypoxia, we
treated RKO cells with siRNA to SETDB1. Knockdown of SETDB1
resulted in partial re-expression of APAK in hypoxia, while having
no effect on APAK mRNA levels in normoxia or reoxygenation
(Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S3d). SETDB1 can be found in
a complex with the transcriptional co-repressor KAP-1, which has a
role in heterochromatin formation by promoting H3K9me3
spreading.26 The region that we investigated in our ChIP-qPCR
analysis also had a KAP-1-binding site (Supplementary Figure S3c).
We investigated whether KAP-1 had any effect on APAK repression

797
by again assessing APAK mRNA levels following KAP-1 siRNAmediated knockdown and found a supportive but nonsigniﬁcant
effect on APAK expression in hypoxia (Supplementary Figures S3e
and f). Next, we investigated whether other methyltransferases,
besides SETDB1, could also be mediating APAK repression. Suv39h1
loss did not lead to a signiﬁcant effect on APAK repression
(Figure 3c and Supplementary Figures S3g and h). Finally, we tested
the possible involvement of G9a on hypoxia-mediated APAK
repression. siRNA-mediated depletion of G9a did not result in a
signiﬁcant effect on APAK repression (Figure 3d and Supplementary
Figure S3i). This conclusion was also reached using a speciﬁc G9a
inhibitor UNC0642, despite the decrease in H3K9me2 and H3K9me3
observed following treatment with increasing concentrations of the
inhibitor (Supplementary Figures S3j and k). Therefore, of the
principal H3K9 methyltransferases and those tested here, SETDB1 is
the primary methyltransferase involved in mediating APAK repression in hypoxia.
Pharmacological manipulation of H3K9me3 levels affects cell
viability and apoptosis in hypoxia
The data presented so far suggested that APAK is regulated in an
H3K9me3- and oxygen-dependent manner and that appropriate
regulation of this gene is important for facilitating p53-dependent
apoptosis. This led us to question whether pharmacologically
manipulating H3K9me3 levels under conditions in which APAK is
not normally repressed could also lead to an increase in p53dependent apoptosis. If this strategy was to be successful, it could
be potentially used with therapeutic intent given that low APAK
expression appears to correlate with better prognosis in human
samples (at least in certain colorectal tumors) (Figure 1d). To test
this hypothesis, we used the demethylase inhibitor ML324. First,
we asked whether cell viability was affected by ML324 in mildly
hypoxic conditions (2% O2), which would normally be associated
with normal cell growth and proliferation (where APAK levels are
not normally repressed). A signiﬁcant loss of viability was
observed in RKO cells exposed to ML324 in hypoxia compared
with either hypoxia alone or ML324 treatment in normoxia
(Figure 4a and Supplementary Figures S4a and b). We conﬁrmed
that H3K9me3 levels had been induced in cells treated with
ML324 at 2% O2 by western blotting (Figure 4b). Interestingly,
treatment with ML324 induced DNA damage, as judged by
increased γ-H2AX levels and phosphorylated p53, and this
occurred independently of oxygen levels (Figure 4b). These data
also demonstrated an increase in PARP cleavage in the cells
exposed to ML324 in hypoxic conditions, suggesting that the
inhibitor had induced apoptosis (Figure 4b). A signiﬁcant increase
in apoptosis in the presence of ML324 and hypoxia was then
further veriﬁed (Figure 4c). As the demethylase inhibitor ML324
increases H3K9me3 levels, we predicted that treatment with this
inhibitor would result in APAK repression. As expected, APAK
mRNA expression was decreased following ML324 treatment
(Supplementary Figure S4c). Finally, we asked whether the
previously observed ML324-induced apoptosis, which correlated
with an increase in H3K9me3 and repression of APAK (Figures 4b
and c), was actually dependent on APAK expression. RKO cells
either overexpressing APAK or the control vectors were exposed
to normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) in the presence or absence of
ML324. Once again, ML324 in hypoxia led to increased apoptosis;
however, this effect was lost in the presence of overexpressed
APAK (Figure 4d and Supplementary Figure S4d). These data
suggest that increased apoptosis observed following ML324
treatment was at least partially dependent on APAK expression.
Overall, we provide evidence, for the ﬁrst time, of a role for
H3K9me3 in facilitating p53-dependent apoptosis in response to
hypoxia. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate an oxygen-dependent but
HIF-1/p53-independent induction of H3K9me3 in response to
hypoxia that in turn causes the SETDB1-dependent repression of

Figure 4. Pharmacological manipulation of H3K9me3 levels affects cell viability and apoptosis in hypoxia. (a) RKO cells were treated with 1 μM
JMJD2 (JMJD2E) inhibitor, ML324 (Axon Medchem, Groningen, The Netherlands) or DMSO and exposed to 21 or 2% O2 for 24 h. Clonogenic
survival assays were carried out. Colonies (of at least 50 cells) were allowed to form for 7–10 days. Colonies were then stained with methylene
blue and counted. Error bars indicate standard error between technical replicates. A representative graph of one of three independent
experiments is shown for all ﬁgures showing clonogenic assays unless otherwise stated. (b) RKO cells were treated with either DMSO or ML324
(10 μM) and exposed to either 21 or 2% O2 for 48 h. Western blotting was carried out with the antibodies indicated as previously described.
H2A (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA), γH2AX (Upstate/Millipore) and PARP (Cell Signaling). (c) RKO cells were treated as in (b). Apoptosis by
nuclear morphology was measured as the number of apoptotic/nonapoptotic cells expressed as a percentage of the whole population. (d)
RKO cells transfected with either Myc-APAK or Myc-empty plasmids and treated with 10 μM ML324 for 24 h followed by incubation in 21% or
2% O2 for an additional 24 h. Apoptosis was measured as in (c). (e) Schematic representation of the proposed model. Hypoxia increases
H3K9me3 levels, which in turn leads to APAK repression and p53-dependent apoptosis. Increased H3K9me3 levels and subsequent decreased
APAK expression results from both pharmacological inhibition of JMJD2 enzymes (ML324) or through the action of methyltransferase SETDB1.

the p53-negative regulator, APAK and increased apoptosis
(Figure 4e). Importantly, this mechanism of gene repression is
reversible, meaning that cells that survive periods of severe
hypoxia can then restore APAK-mediated control of p53 when
normal oxygen levels are restored. Hypoxia-mediated repression
of DNA repair pathways can result in the induction of a mutator
phenotype and thereby promote tumorigenesis. Indeed, a role for
hypoxia in the aberrant epigenetic silencing of genes involved in
tumor suppression has been proposed. Under conditions of severe
hypoxia, however, the activation of the DNA damage response has
been proposed to mount a barrier to tumorigenesis.6,27 Here, we
propose that the role of hypoxia-induced H3K9me3 in repressing
APAK may actually contribute to such tumorigenesis barrier by
facilitating p53-dependent apoptosis. This is supported by the
ﬁnding that low APAK expression correlated with better prognosis
in a small number of colon cancer patients (Figure 1d). It is
important to note that the correlation between low APAK
expression and a better prognosis would be predicted to be
restricted to tumors with wild-type p53.
As a result of the role identiﬁed here in hypoxia-induced p53dependent apoptosis, H3K9me3 can be considered as a potential

therapeutic target. We tested the hypothesis that by increasing
the levels of H3K9me3, through inhibition of key demethylases,
we could drive cells into apoptosis (Figure 4). The inhibitor used in
our study, ML324, not only increased the levels of H3K9me3 in
cells exposed to mild hypoxia, which normally show a minimal
induction of H3K9me3, but it also induced DNA damage. It is likely
that not all demethylase inhibitors will have both of these
functions and may therefore need to be combined with standard
DNA damaging agents to achieve the effects reported here.
Furthermore, although ML324 has been reported to be a potent
and selective inhibitor of JMJD2, with submicromolar inhibitory
activity toward JMJD2E, it would be important to verify whether
the use of this inhibitor further contributes to APAK repression via
the inhibition of other JMJD2 family members besides JMJD2E.19 It
is clear from our study, however, that the demethylase inhibitor
used here can be exploited to alter gene expression patterns and
that these effects are determined by the tumor microenvironment. This further highlights the need to test new agents in
settings mimicking conditions such as tumor hypoxia.
In summary, this study highlights a previously uncharacterized
role for APAK in response to severe hypoxia, and it provides a

H3K9me3-mediated regulation of APAK may have important
consequences for the maintenance of genomic integrity and the
barrier to tumorigenesis.
