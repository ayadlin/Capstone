Abstract
The underlying causes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are
unclear, and treatment options for patients with advanced
disease are limited. There is evidence that the use of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with
decreased risk of developing EOC. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2,
which catalyze prostaglandin biosynthesis. We previously
showed that mouse and human EOCs have increased levels
of COX-1, but not COX-2, and a COX-1–selective inhibitor, SC560, attenuates prostaglandin production and tumor growth.
However, the downstream targets of COX-1 signaling in EOC
are not yet known. To address this question, we evaluated
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor D (PPARD) expression and function in EOC. We found that EOC cells express
high levels of PPARD, and neutralizing PPARD function reduces
tumor growth in vivo. More interestingly, aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that preferentially inhibits
COX-1, compromises PPARD function and cell growth by
inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, members
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Our study, for
the first time, shows that whereas PPARD can be a target of
COX-1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase is a potential
target of PPARD. The ability of aspirin to inhibit EOC growth
in vivo is an exciting finding because of its low cost, lack of
cardiovascular side effects, and availability. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The hallmark of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC), arising from
the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), is the rapid growth and
spread of solid i.p. tumors frequently associated with ascites and
other complications. EOC is the major cause of death in patients
with gynecologic malignancies and is the fourth leading cause of
cancer death in the United States (1–3). Patient mortality is high
because diagnosis of the disease at early stages is difficult and its
underlying causes are poorly understood.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of
arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandins. Although overwhelming
evidence suggests a role for COX-2 in a variety of cancers, the
contribution of COX-1 to cancers remains undefined or controversial (4). We recently showed that human EOC overexpresses
COX-1, but not COX-2, and that prostacyclin (PGI2 ) and
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are the major prostanoids generated by
COX-1 in human ovarian cancer cells, OVCAR3 (1). We have also
shown that genetically engineered mouse OSE cells lacking p53 but
expressing c-myc and Akt, or c-myc and K-ras, produce tumors that
overexpress COX-1 with little or no COX-2 expression (4). These
OSE cells primarily produce PGI2 via COX-1, and treatment with
SC-560, a selective COX-1 inhibitor, attenuates PGI2 production and
OSE cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo (4). More
importantly, various mouse models of EOC also show high COX-1
overexpression when compared with COX-2, suggesting that the
participation of COX-1 in EOC is not unique to specific genetic and
oncogenic alterations, but rather is a general characteristic of EOC
(5). Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a
nonspecific COX inhibitor that preferentially inhibits COX-1 over
COX-2 (6). Aspirin has an added advantage of being readily
available and inexpensive. Some epidemiologic studies have found
an association between the consumption of aspirin and a reduced
risk of many cancers, including EOC (7–9).
The downstream targets of COX-1–derived prostaglandins in
EOC are not yet known. PGI2 and PGE2, in addition to their
interactions with cell surface G-protein–coupled receptors IP and
EP, respectively, can also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor y (PPARy). Although PGI2 can directly bind and activate
PPARy, PGE2 transactivates PPARy via the Wnt/h-catenin pathway
in colorectal cancer (10, 11). Each PPAR isoform (PPARy, PPARa,
and PPARg) binds to sequence-specific DNA response elements as
a heterodimer with one of the retinoic acid X receptors (RXRa,
RXRh, or RXRg), a promiscuous partner (12). PPARy was also
shown to play important roles in embryo implantation, placentation, epidermal maturation, wound healing, fatty acid metabolism,
repression of atherogenic inflammatory responses, and regulation
of apoptosis (13–18).
Although PPARy has been implicated in tumorigenesis, its exact
role remains unclear (19–21). In mammary and hepatocellular
cancers, PPARy activation stimulates cell proliferation and tumor
growth (22, 23). In addition, PPARy is overexpressed in human
colorectal tumors (24), head and neck squamous carcinomas (25),
endometrial adenocarcinomas (26), and human breast cancer cell
lines (27). Although we have shown that activation of PPARy
promotes intestinal tumor growth in mice, there is also evidence

that its activation attenuates tumor growth (19–21, 28). These
disparate results suggest that the contribution of PPARy to tumor
growth depends on the cellular context and perhaps the genetic
makeup of the species being studied. To our knowledge, the
expression profile of PPARy and its role in EOC have not yet been
examined.
In this study, we found that PPARy is highly expressed in
mouse and human EOC tumors and that neutralization of PPARy
activity results in reduced tumor growth in mouse models of
EOC. We also provide new evidence that aspirin compromises
PPARy function by lowering prostaglandin levels and attenuates
EOC cell growth by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. These results, and our previous observations of heightened expression of COX-1 in EOC, suggest that
COX-1-PPARy-ERK signaling plays a critical role in EOC, and
inhibition of this signaling cascade by aspirin provides a potential
treatment option for EOC.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Immunocompromised Rag2/cC null female mice were used for all
experiments. Homozygous Rag2/cC null females, hemizygous cC null, and
homozygous Rag2 null males derived on a B6 background were purchased
from Taconic. We also generated Rag2/cC null mice on a CD1 background
(F7) for experiments. All mice were used between 6 and 12 weeks of age and
housed in the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care Facility according to
NIH and Institutional guidelines on the care and use of laboratory animals.
Cell lines and culture. To generate C1 (genotype: p53 / , c-myc,
K-ras) and C2 (genotype: p53 / , c-myc, Akt) cell lines, ovarian explants
from K5-TVA/p53 / mice were infected with different combinations of
RCAS viruses carrying human c-myc, mouse K-rasG12D , and mouse myr-Akt1
oncogenes as previously described (2, 4). Cell cultures were passaged in
the presence of virus for 3 weeks, after which they consisted of a pure
population of transformed OSE cells. T1 and T2 cell lines were derived by
isolating cells from tumors that were generated by orthotopic placement
of C1 and C2 cells into nude mice, respectively. C1, C2, T1, and T2 cell
lines develop tumors when transplanted into immunocompromised mice.
OSE cells were propagated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum,

100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin. OVCAR3
human ovarian cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
cultured in RPMI 1640 (American Type Culture Collection) supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For ERK phosphorylation
assays, T2 (5  104 cells/60 mm dish) or OVCAR3 (105 cells/60 mm dish)
cells were seeded and incubated for 24 or 72 h, respectively, followed by
24 h of serum starvation. Cells were then treated with AA (Cayman
Chemical), carbaprostacyclin (cPGI, Cayman Chemical) or GW501516
(Synthelab AB) at indicated doses for different time points. Treatment
with COX inhibitors (SC-560, aspirin, or celecoxib) was started 2 h prior to
AA treatment.
Hybridization probes. cDNA clones for COX-1, PPARd, and RXRa have
previously been described (5, 13). For in situ hybridization, sense and
antisense 35S-labeled cRNA probes were generated using Sp6 and T7 RNA
polymerases, respectively. For Northern hybridization, antisense 32P-labeled
cRNA probes were generated. rPL7 was used as a housekeeping gene.
Probes had specific activities of 2  109 dpm/Ag.
RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted
from cultured cells or tissue specimens using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
Total RNA (6 Ag) was denatured, separated by formaldehyde/agarose gel
electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and UV cross-linked. Blots
were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as we have previously
described (13).
In situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was carried out as
previously described (13). Sections were prehybridized and hybridized at
45jC for 4 h in 50% formamide hybridization buffer containing 35S-labeled
antisense or sense cRNA probes. RNase A–resistant hybrids were detected
by autoradiography. Sections were poststained with H&E. Sections hybridized with sense probes did not show any positive signals and served as
negative controls.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done as previously
described (4). Membranes were blocked with 10% milk in TBST and probed
with antibodies against mouse PPARy (1:1,000; ref. 13), human PPARy (1:250;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), COX-1 (1:1,000; kindly provided by David Dewitt,
Michigan State University; ref. 5), actin (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
ERK (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), or phospho-ERK (1:500, Cell Signaling)
overnight at 4jC. After thorough washing, blots were incubated in
peroxidase-conjugated donkey/anti-goat IgG or donkey/anti-rabbit IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, Inc.), followed by washing. Protein signals
were detected using chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham).

Transfection and luciferase assay. T2 cells (3  104 cells/well) were
seeded in 24-well plates and inoculated in growth media for 16 h. Cells were
transfected with 0.3 Ag UAS-tk-luc/0.3 Ag PPARd-GAL4/2.5 ng pRL-SV40
(Promega) or 0.3 Ag PPAR-responsive element (PPRE)-tk-luc/2.5 ng pRL-SV40
using LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent according to the instructions of the
manufacturer (Invitrogen). OVCAR3 cells (1.5  105 cells/well) were seeded
in 12-well plates and inoculated in growth media for 16 h. Cells were
transfected with 0.4 Ag UAS-tk-luc/0.4 Ag PPARd-GAL4/5 ng pRL-SV40 using
LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent. After 3 h of incubation, serum-free fresh
medium was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h,
harvested and lysed. Relative light units from firefly luciferase activity were
determined by using a luminometer (MGM Instruments) and normalized to
relative light units from renilla luciferase using a Dual Luciferase kit
(Promega). All constructs were kindly provided by Barry Forman (Gonda
Diabetes Center).
Prostaglandin assays. OVCAR3 (2  105 cells/well) or T2 (105 cells/well)
cells were incubated in 24-well plates in growth media for 16 h. Cells were
then incubated in serum-free media for 24 h. After changing to serum-free
media containing AA and/or aspirin, cells were incubated for an additional
4 h. Media were collected and analyzed for prostaglandin levels by gas
chromatography negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assay
(13). AA and aspirin were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, respectively.
Controls contained appropriate concentrations of vehicles.

Allografting and xenografting OSE cells for tumor growth studies.
For aspirin studies, a suspension of T2 (107 cells) or OVCAR3 (6  106 cells)
cells was s.c. injected under the dorsal skin of 6- to 12-week-old female
Rag2 / /cC / mice. Tumor growth was recorded every 4 to 5 days by
direct measurement of tumor dimensions. Aspirin at 500 ppm or 3,000 ppm
mixed with pulverized food was kindly provided by Clinton Grubbs,
University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL. Mice were fed with aspirincontaining or control diet from the day of tumor grafting until sacrifice. To
assess the effect of PPARy on tumor growth, suspensions of polyclonal T2
cells (107) expressing DNhPPARy (pDN) or empty vector (pVEC) were
placed under the dorsal skin of 6- to 12-week-old female Rag2 / /cC /
mice. Tumor growth was measured weekly. Tumor volume was calculated
according to the equation V = 0.5  (LW 2), where V, volume; L, length;
and W, width (29).

Results
PPARD is highly expressed in EOC. To determine whether
PPARy has a role in EOC, we first examined its expression using
mouse models of EOC as we have previously described (2). The
derivation of C1, C2, T1, and T2 mouse ovarian cancer cell lines is
described in Materials and Methods. Northern hybridization (Fig. 1A,
top) and Western blotting (Fig. 1A, bottom) show that both PPARy
mRNA and protein are expressed in all four cell lines. We next
examined the expression of PPARy in tumors generated in vivo from
these cell lines. Northern (Fig. 1B, top) and Western blot analyses
(Fig. 1B, bottom) show that PPARy is expressed in tumors generated
from each cell line. In contrast, whereas PPARc mRNA was detected
at low levels in only C1 and T1 cell lines and tumors, PPARa mRNA
was low to undetectable in all four cell lines and tumors (data not
shown).
To determine cell-specific localization of PPARy, we did in situ
hybridization in tumors generated from each cell line (Fig. 1C).
Again, PPARd was expressed in all tumors, whereas its expression
in normal ovaries was low to undetectable. Microscopic examination of the hybridized sections poststained with H&E under brightfield showed that hybridization signals were primarily restricted to
epithelial-like cells. In contrast, expression of PPARa and PPARc
was low to undetectable, although some focal expression was noted
in some tumors (data not shown). Furthermore, RXRa , a
heterodimeric partner of PPARs for transcriptional activity, is also

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

expressed in these tumors (Fig. 1C). We also evaluated a limited
number (n = 9) of human ovarian tumors or nontumorous ovaries
by in situ hybridization. Although all EOC samples expressed
PPARd , nontumorous ovarian samples showed little to no PPARd
expression (Fig. 1D). More importantly, PPARd expression overlapped with that of COX-1 in human EOC (Fig. 1D, top). PPARd
mRNA was also detected in OVCAR3 cells and tumors generated
from this cell line (data not shown). Collectively, our results show
that PPARy expression is associated with mouse and human EOC.
Aspirin attenuates COX-1-PGI2-PPARD signaling in EOC.
cPGI, a stable analogue of PGI2, and GW501516, a selective
synthetic agonist of PPARy, activate PPARy in a variety of cell
lines (24, 30, 31). Therefore, we examined the ability of cPGI or
GW501516 to activate PPARy in T2 and OVCAR3 cell lines using a
PPARy-LBD-GAL4 ligand–binding reporter assay (24, 32). As
shown in Fig. 2A, reporter activity is enhanced by both cPGI
and GW501516 in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines.
These data suggest that GW501516 or cPGI can bind to PPARy to
enhance its activity. To determine whether these agonists can
enhance PPARy function, we used the PPRE-tk-luc system (21, 24,
32). This reporter contains three tandem repeats of the PPRE
from the promoter of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene. GW501516 and
cPGI each increases the reporter activity compared with vehicletreated cells (Fig. 2B). As previously shown (13), the reporter
activity was significantly enhanced when cells were treated with a

combination of GW501516 or cPGI with 9-cis-retinoic acid, a
natural ligand for RXR (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that
GW501516 and cPGI are each capable of binding PPARy and
enhancing its activity in EOC.
The ability of cPGI to enhance PPARy activity is especially
interesting because PGI2 is the main prostaglandin produced in
T2 cells and its production is attenuated by a COX-1 inhibitor,
SC-560 (4). We also observed that OVCAR3 cells produce PGI2, and
SC-560 reduces its production, whereas celecoxib (a COX-2–
selective inhibitor) had little effect (Supplemental Fig. S1). Although
SC-560 attenuates prostaglandin production in EOC cells and their
growth in vitro and in vivo (4), this compound is not being
developed for clinical purposes. On the other hand, aspirin, known
to preferentially inhibit COX-1, is widely available at a low cost (6).
This provoked us to examine whether aspirin would have an effect
on EOC. This hypothesis is consistent with recent epidemiologic
evidence indicating that regular consumption of aspirin is
associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including EOC
(7–9).
As shown in Fig. 2C, aspirin lowers PGI2 levels in both T2 and
OVCAR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also attenuates
PPARy-LBD-GAL4 transactivation with AA in OVCAR3 cells
(Fig. 2D). These data suggest that aspirin, similar to SC-560,
inhibits prostaglandin production, and implicates PPARy as a
downstream target of COX-1–derived prostaglandins.
Inhibition of COX-1-PPARD signaling attenuates tumor
growth in vitro and in vivo. Because cPGI or GW501516
enhances PPARy activity and aspirin attenuates prostaglandin
production and PPARy activity, we next asked whether aspirin
affects EOC cell growth. As shown in Fig. 3A, aspirin decreases the
growth of T2 and OVCAR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner as
determined by MTT assays. To examine the role of PPARy, we used
a DNhPPARd construct because PPARy-selective inhibitors are
not currently available. T2 cells were stably transfected with
DNhPPARd construct or empty vector and selected with antibiotics
(zeocin) to establish a polyclonal cell line (pDN or pVEC). Western
blotting results confirmed that the transfection was successful
because DNhPPARy is expressed in pDN cells, but not in pVEC cells
(Fig. 3B, inset). As expected, endogenous mouse PPARy and COX-1
proteins are expressed in pDN and pVEC cell lines (Fig. 3B, inset).
We used these transfected cell lines to examine whether
DNhPPARy attenuates EOC cell growth. As shown in Fig. 3B,
pDN cells grow at a slower rate when compared with pVEC.
We next examined whether aspirin reduces EOC growth in vivo
in our mouse models. T2 cells were s.c. allografted to
immunocompromised Rag2 / /cC / mice. These mice were
allowed to consume diets with or without aspirin (3,000 ppm)
from the day of the allograft up to 6 to 8 weeks. As shown in
Fig. 4A, mice consuming the aspirin-containing diet had
significantly slower rates of tumor growth. We did similar

experiments using OVCAR3 cells that were s.c. xenografted to
immunocompromised Rag2 / /cC / mice and tumor growth
was monitored. Again, tumor growth was significantly compromised in mice consuming aspirin (Fig. 4B). No apparent toxic side

effects were noted in the treatment group. The inhibitory effects
of aspirin on tumor growth were significant even when a lower
dose (500 ppm) of aspirin was used (Fig. 4C). Because PPARyspecific antagonists are not available, we used pDN (dominant
negative) cells to define the role of this transcription factor in
EOC growth. Indeed, immunocompromised Rag2 / /cC / mice
allografted s.c. with pDN cells showed dramatically reduced rates
of tumor growth when compared with mice bearing the same
numbers of pVEC cells (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these results suggest
that whereas the enhancement of COX-1-PPARy signaling
pathway promotes cell and tumor growth in EOC, inhibition of
this signaling by aspirin or DNPPARy reduces such growth.
COX-1-PPARD signaling regulates cell growth through
ERK1/2 activation. The ERK signaling pathway is constitutively
activated in many types of cancers, most often promoting cell cycle
progression (reviewed in ref. 33). Although it is not known whether
the COX-PPARy signaling pathway can activate ERK signaling,
there is evidence that PGE2 enhances cell proliferation via ERK1/2
phosphorylation in colorectal cancer cells (34), and GW501516
induces ERK phosphorylation in lung cancer cells (35). These
findings raise the possibility that the COX-1-PPARy signaling
pathway affects ERK phosphorylation. Indeed, we observed that an
ERK-phosphorylation inhibitor (PD98059) decreases cell viability
in both T2 and OVCAR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

(Supplemental Fig. S2). We also asked whether altering the COX-1PPARy signaling pathway would affect ERK activation in EOC. As
shown in Fig. 5A, AA induces ERK phosphorylation in T2 and
OVCAR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. This AA-induced ERK
phosphorylation in these cells is attenuated after their exposure to
SC-560 or aspirin, but not celecoxib (Fig. 5B). We also observed that
cPGI or GW501516 induces ERK phosphorylation in these cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). More importantly, ERK activation with cPGI was not observed in pDN cells (Fig. 5D). Overall, our
results suggest that prostaglandins produced by COX-1 activate
PPARy and promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation which increases EOC
growth. The observed ERK activation was quite rapid. The earliest
response we observed was between 5 and 10 min, albeit with some
experimental variation (data not shown). All results shown are for
the 30 min time point.

Discussion
The present investigation highlights that PPARy is a downstream
target of COX-1–derived prostaglandins, and this signaling
activates ERK to stimulate EOC growth. Although COX-2–derived
prostaglandins were shown to induce PPARy signaling (21, 24), our
results showing that COX-1–derived prostaglandins target ERK
phosphorylation via PPARy activation and influence tumor growth

COX-1-PPARd-ERK Signaling in EOC

in mouse and human models of EOC are novel. We found that
either reducing the levels of PGI2 serving as a PPARy ligand or
reducing PPARy function intervenes with EOC growth. These
observations provide strong evidence that growth-promoting
effects are mediated by COX-1–derived prostaglandins affecting
PPARy function. This is supported by our observation of enhanced
PPARy activity in EOC cells by cPGI or GW501516.
ERK signaling is known to be activated in numerous cancers and
is considered a prime target for cancer therapy (33, 36–38). Indeed,
several inhibitors of this pathway have been tested in clinical trials
(37). Ras signaling is heightened in a variety of cancers, and one of
the downstream effectors in the Ras cascade is ERK activation
(reviewed in refs. 33, 39, 40). It is known that many extracellular
stimuli bind to their membrane receptors to recruit Ras to initiate
its signal transduction cascade with eventual ERK phosphorylation
(33, 34). However, studies addressing whether and how PPARy
induces ERK phosphorylation are very limited. There is evidence
that PGE2 can transactivate PPARy and activate Ras-ERK signaling
cascades in colorectal cancer cells (34). A recent study also shows
that GW501516 phosphorylates ERK in lung cancer cells (35). Our
studies showing induction of ERK phosphorylation in EOC cells by
cPGI or GW501516, and its attenuation by inhibition of COX-1 or
PPARy function provide strong evidence that COX-1-PPARy-ERK
signaling plays an important role in EOC. Further studies are
required to determine how PPARy ligands stimulate ERK
phosphorylation. Although COX-2–derived PGE2 is known to
influence the growth of many solid tumors by activating PPARy
and canonical Wnt signaling (10, 21), our studies showing
the involvement of COX-1, PPARy, and ERK activation in mouse
and human models of EOC suggest that signaling cascades
for promoting tumor growth is complex and tissue context–
dependent.
Although rapid ERK phosphorylation by cPGI or GW501516 is
interesting, the mechanism by which this is achieved is not
presently clear. Because of the rapidity of the response, it is
assumed that this activation does not involve protein synthesis.
There is evidence that a consensus mitogen-activated protein

kinase site located within the A/B domain of hPPARg regulates its
transcriptional activity through phosphorylation (41). If such a
kinase domain is present in PPARy, it may be possible that
phosphorylation of PPARy following its activation in turn transphosphorylates other substrates within the cell. It has also been
shown that PPARg ligands can rapidly activate the MEK/ERK
pathway via phosphoinositide-3-kinase or epidermal growth factor
receptor, a phenomenon similar to that observed in rapid signaling
by steroid hormones for their ‘‘nongenomic’’ effects (42–44).
Whether this is true for PPARy remains to be determined. The
mechanism by which PPARy activation rapidly turns on ERK
phosphorylation is currently under investigation in our laboratory.
Although aspirin as a potential anticancer drug has been
considered, its efficacy as a therapeutic agent remains controversial because of inconclusive recommendations regarding dose,
duration of treatment, and/or age of patients (45). A recent case
study found that the use of many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, including aspirin, within 5 years of diagnosis or interview,
was associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer (7). This
study, however, was limited in its ability to detect beyond the
5-year time frame. Aspirin was also effective in reducing
colorectal cancer risk by 35% if taken for >10 years (46–48).
These preliminary clinical studies and our current findings
showing that aspirin inhibits the COX-1-PPARy-ERK signaling
cascade reinforces the importance of further investigating the role
of aspirin as a potential treatment for EOC.
