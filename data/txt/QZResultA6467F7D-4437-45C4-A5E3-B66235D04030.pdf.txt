BACKGROUND. The role for completion axillary dissection (CLND) in patients
with breast cancer who have tumor-positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) has
been questioned. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term safety
of avoiding CLND in selected patients with positive SLNs.

METHODS. Patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy at the
authors’ institution between 1993 and July 2005 were reviewed. Of 3366 total
patients, 750 patients had a positive SLN. There were 196 patients with a positive
SLN who did not undergo CLND based on clinician and patient preference. Clinicopathologic variables and treatment patterns were analyzed along with locoregional, distant recurrence, and survival.
RESULTS. Most tumors were infiltrating ductal carcinomas (74%), estrogen recep-

T

he advent of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) for
patients with cancer has made a significant impact on the field
of surgical oncology.1,2 For patients with breast cancer, SLNB affords
decreased morbidity compared with axillary dissection,3,4 including
a lower rate of lymphedema, seromas, pain, and sensory changes.5
More detailed analysis of the SLN increases the accuracy of staging,6,7 and this has been adopted into the most recent edition of
the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging handbook.8,9

Current guidelines from the American Society of
Clinical Oncology recommend completion axillary
lymph node dissection (CLND) for patients who have
metastases (>0.2 mm) identified in an SLN by any
method of detection.10 However, CLND potentially
may be beneficial for only half of those patients,
because, in 40% to 60% of patients, the SLN is the
only positive lymph node.11 Studies from our group
as well as others have indicated that the primary tumor size, the presence of lymphovascular invasion
(LVI), the size of the SLN metastasis, and the number
of positive SLNs are associated with an increased risk
of having positive nonsentinel lymph nodes
(NSLNs).12–18 In our previous study, the number of
SLNs harvested also was related inversely to the risk
of additional positive NSLNs.16 Van Zee and colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
have developed a web-based nomogram to help clinicians predict a patient’s risk of additional positive
lymph nodes19 that has been validated by other institutions.20,21 The increasing use of this nomogram
and other models will influence clinicians in their
recommendations for CLND. Furthermore, widespread use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT),
and endocrine therapy for many patients also may
diminish the added benefit of CLND.
The outcome of patients with a positive SLN
who do not undergo CLND is unclear. In the current
study, we analyzed our prospective database of
patients with breast cancer who had SLN metastases
but who declined CLND to determine their locoregional recurrence and survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the records of patients who underwent
SLNB for invasive breast cancer who were included
in the prospective database at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UT-MDACC).
Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review
Board prior to conducting this study. Between January 1993 and July 2005, 3366 patients underwent
SLNB for invasive breast cancer. We identified the
patients within that group who had a positive SLN
identified either by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining or by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cytokeratin. We also selected the patients who did not
undergo CLND for additional study.

Technique of Intraoperative Lymphatic Mapping
and SLNB
Our technique of SLNB has been described elsewhere.22 Briefly, intraoperative lymphatic mapping
was performed with injections of blue dye alone,

technetium 99m-labeled sulfur colloid, or a combination of the 2 agents. The injection of technetium
99m sulfur colloid was performed under mammographic or sonographic guidance when the tumor
was not palpable. On the day of surgery, 5 mL of 1%
isosulfan blue (Lymphazurin; US Surgical, Norwalk,
Conn) were injected peritumorally, and the breast
was massaged for 5 minutes. SLNs were identified as
the lymph nodes with uptake of blue dye, radiotracer, or both.
During the SLNB technique learning phase, each
surgeon performed immediate level I and II CLND
for the first 30 SLN biopsies. Patients with a positive
SLN on final pathology are offered CLND as our
institution’s standard practice. However, patients in
this study did not undergo CLND either because of
their participation in a clinical trial or because of
patient preference after consultation with their physicians.

Pathologic Evaluations
Pathologic evaluation of SLNs within our institution
has evolved with changes in technology. Prior to
April 2000, SLNs were sectioned serially along the
short axis at 2-mm to 3-mm intervals; sections were
embedded in paraffin blocks, and 1 level from each
block was stained with H&E. Beginning in April 2000,
each paraffin block was sectioned serially at 5-lm
intervals to produce 10 levels. Levels 1, 2, and 4 were
evaluated by routine H&E staining, and level 3 was
analyzed for cytokeratin by IHC.23
The maximum dimension of the metastasis in
each SLN was measured. If >1 deposit of tumor was
observed in an SLN or if multiple SLNs were positive,
then the size of the largest tumor deposit was
recorded. All SLNs were examined for extranodal
extension. The 6th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual was used for staging.9
Primary tumors were evaluated for the size of
the invasive component, histologic type, Black nuclear grade, estrogen receptor status, progesterone
receptor status, HER-2/neu status, and presence of
LVI. For hormone receptors, >10% staining of the
cells by IHC was considered positive. HER-2/neu was
considered positive for 31 overexpression by IHC or
gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Adjuvant Therapy
Most patients received an anthracycline-containing
regimen. Adjuvant chemotherapy was offered to
patients with lymph node involvement and to
patients with lymph node-negative disease and
tumors that measured 1 cm in greatest dimension.

Positive SLN in Breast CA Without CLND/Hwang et al.

Preoperative chemotherapy was used on clinical protocols that were designed to compare the efficacy of
2 chemotherapy regimens or for patients who had
operable, large breast cancers to achieve tumor
shrinkage and to facilitate breast conservation. Endocrine therapy was considered for patients with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptorpositive tumors after chemotherapy or, for patients
who did not receive chemotherapy, after surgery.

Radiation Therapy
Adjuvant external-beam RT to the whole breast was
offered to all patients who underwent breast conservation. The majority of these patients also received a
radiation boost to the tumor bed. Radiation to the
regional lymph nodes and postmastectomy radiation
were used at the discretion of the radiation oncologist.
Patient Follow-up
Patients were followed with history and physical
examinations at least every 6 months for the first 5
years and annually every year thereafter. Mammograms were obtained 6 months after the completion
of RT for breast-conserving treatment and annually
thereafter. Repeat imaging studies of the lymph node
basins and other potential sites of distant disease
were obtained if there was clinical suspicion based
on history, physical examination, or abnormal laboratory values.
Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to assess the frequency distribution among the study population.
The endpoints for analysis were rates of locoregional
and distant recurrence as well as overall survival.
Survival analyses were calculated by using the
Kaplan-Meier method. The SPSS 10.1 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) was used for statistical
analyses.

RESULTS
Patients and Primary Tumor Characteristics
We evaluated the records of 3366 consecutive
patients with breast cancer who underwent SLNB at
our institution between 1993 and July 2005. The total
number of patients who had a positive SLN and
invasive breast cancer was 750. There were 196
patients who did not undergo CLND, and they
formed the study group for the current analysis (Table 1). Six of the patients in the study group were enrolled in the American College of Surgeons Oncology
Group Z0011 trial and were randomized to the obser-

undergo CLND because of patient preference after
consultation with their physician.
The median patient age was 56 years (range, 29–
88 years). The majority of patients underwent breast
conservation concurrently with or before SLNB (135
patients; 68.9%). The predominant primary tumor
histology was invasive ductal carcinoma (145
patients; 74%). The initial stage of the primary tumor
was T1 in 72.4% of patients, and most tumors had a
modified Black nuclear grade of 2. Of the 158 tumors
for which information on LVI was available, 21.9%
were positive. Eighty-two percent of tumors were
estrogen receptor-positive, 69.9% were positive for
progesterone receptor, and 12.8% were positive for
HER-2/neu.

SLN Characteristics
The median number of SLNs identified was 3 per
patient (range, 1–14 SLNs per patient) (Table 2), with a
median of 1 positive SLN identified per patient (range,
1–6 positive SLN per patient). The majority of SLN
metastases were detected by serial sectioning and
H&E staining (126 patients; 64.3%), rather than IHC
(70 patients; 35.7%). The amount of metastatic disease
in the SLN was small, and the median size of the largest SLN tumor deposit was 1.0 mm (range, 0.1–12.9
mm). Sixty-seven patients had isolated tumor cells
that measured no greater than 0.2 mm (pN0[i1]), 90
patients had micrometastasis (>0.2 mm, none; >2
mm; pN1mi), and 39 patients had macrometastasis
that measured >2 mm. Information regarding extracapsular extension of the SLN metastasis was available
for 193 patients, and only 10 patients (5.1%) had SLNs
with extracapsular extension. There were 23 patients
who had NSLNs recovered, 1 of whom had an NSLN
that was positive for metastasis.

cal stage T2 on presentation with negative axillae
by ultrasound. The majority of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (109 patients; 55.6%) and RT
(114 patients; 55.6%). Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens consisted of anthracycline-based therapy in 49
patients, taxane alone in 5 patients, and anthracycline with taxane in 55 patients. Fifty-three patients
received endocrine therapy alone.
Of the patients who received adjuvant RT, 6
patients had undergone mastectomy, and 108
patients had undergone a lumpectomy. Details
regarding radiation treatment fields were available
for the 89 patients who underwent RT at our institution. Thirty-two of these patients received RT to the
breast and chest wall (36%), 30 patients received RT
to the breast and axilla (34%), and the remaining 26
patients (30%) received comprehensive RT, which
included the axillary apex, internal mammary, infraclavicular, and/or supraclavicular lymph node basins
along with the breast, chest wall, and low axilla.

Patient Follow-up and Outcome
The median follow-up was 29.5 months (range, 1.3–
62.3 months). Two patients died of unrelated causes
(myocardial infarction and advanced lymphoma). Of
the remaining 194 patients, none developed an axillary recurrence, 1 patient developed a supraclavicular
lymph node recurrence, and 3 patients developed
metastatic disease to the lung (2 patients) or bone

Positive SLN in Breast CA Without CLND/Hwang et al.

(1 patient). The median time to recurrence was 32
months (range, 8–44 months).
The patient who developed a supraclavicular
lymph node recurrence had a T1 tumor on presentation, a 0.7-cm invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive ductal carcinoma in situ on final pathology, 1
positive SLN with 1.0-mm metastasis, 5 additional
SLNs that were negative for metastasis, and no extranodal extension. Surgical margins on the segmental
mastectomy specimen were positive for intraductal
carcinoma, but the patient declined any further
treatment. She refused further follow-up until she
presented with palpable supraclavicular lymph node
disease 39 months after diagnosis.
Patient 2, who developed bone metastasis, was a
woman aged 31 years at initial diagnosis with a
strong family history of breast cancer. She underwent
mastectomy with SLNB, which revealed a 2.9-cm,
poorly differentiated, multifocal, invasive ductal carcinoma with 1 positive SLN (0.5 mm metastasis), 10
negative SLNs, and no extranodal extension. She was
treated with adjuvant chemotherapy without RT
but developed bone metastasis 44 months after
diagnosis.
Patient 3 developed lung metastases at 37
months after diagnosis. Her primary tumor was a
2.3-cm invasive ductal carcinoma that was poorly
differentiated, and she had 1 positive SLN (2-mm
metastasis) and no extranodal extension. After she
underwent segmental mastectomy with SLNB, she
received RT to the breast and axilla, chemotherapy,
and endocrine therapy. At 37 months after diagnosis,
she developed hemoptysis and was diagnosed with
pulmonary metastases.
Finally, Patient 4, who also developed lung metastases, initially presented with a T3, poorly differentiated, multifocal, invasive ductal carcinoma. After
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she had 2 positive SLNs
(0.4 mm and 1.2 mm), no extranodal extension, and
3 additional negative SLNs. Postmastectomy radiation was given to the chest wall, axillary, supraclavicular, and internal mammary lymph node basins. She
developed lung metastases at 8 months after initial
diagnosis.

Risk of Positive NSLNs
To determine the probability of additional positive
NSLNs in our study population, we used both the
nomogram developed by Van Zee and colleagues19 at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)
and the model developed by our group16 at UTMDACC. For both models, the initial tumor size was
estimated by imaging studies that were obtained at
presentation prior to neoadjuvant treatment. In our

727

patients, SLN metastases usually were detected by
H&E staining of serial sections or by IHC for cytokeratin; therefore, the method of detection entered in
the MSKCC nomogram typically was not frozen section or routine histopathology. We calculated the risk
of positive NSLNs for all patients with complete information and, based on the MSKCC nomogram, the
median risk for our study population was 9.79%
(range, 2–51%).
In the model developed at UT-MDACC, the
actual size of the metastasis in the SLN is used
instead of the method of detection. To predict the
risk of positive NSLNs, 4 pathologic factors are combined into a total score: the size of the primary tumor, the total number of SLNs removed, the largest
size of the SLN metastasis, and the presence of LVI.
For the patients with complete information, the median score was 20.6 (range, 22.4–3.21) (Fig. 1),
which was associated with a 100% negative predictive value (the ability to predict negative NSLNs) and
43% positive predictive value (the ability to predict
additional positive NSLNs). Thus, using either of
these models, our study population was at low risk
for having additional positive NSLNs and. thus, presumably had a low probability of developing axillary
recurrences.

DISCUSSION
Over the past decade, the standard approach to the
evaluation of axillary lymph node status in patients
with breast cancer has evolved from axillary lymph
node dissection (ALND) to the less invasive alternative, SLNB. The role for SLNB continues to be
defined, and several groups have developed guidelines and nomograms to predict the risk of additional
positive lymph nodes for a patient with a positive
SLN. Many clinicians incorporate the nomogram
developed by Van Zee et al.19 into their counseling
for women with a positive SLN in the decision
regarding CLND. After counseling by their physicians,
or for personal reasons, women with a positive SLN
may elect not to undergo CLND. The outcome of
these patients who have a positive SLN but do not
undergo additional surgery to the axilla is not clear.
In our analysis, we observed that there were no
axillary recurrences in the study population with a
median follow-up of nearly 2.5 years. Other recent
studies also have reported similarly low rates of recurrence in smaller groups of patients with positive
SLNs who did not undergo CLND. A retrospective
study of 31 patients with positive SLNs who declined
ALND was reported by Fant et al.24 Their study
population also had a small volume of metastatic

FIGURE 1. Distribution of scores. The probability of additional positive nonsentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs) was calculated for the current study population
using the model developed at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) (see Hwang et al., 200316) and the nomogram developed by Van
Zee et al. at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) (see Van Zee et al., 200319).

disease in the SLN, similar to our patients, and a majority had micrometastatic disease (<2 mm). No
patients had an axillary recurrence at a median follow-up of 30 months. In their review of 1167 patients
undergoing SLNB, Jeruss et al. reported 73 patients
who had a positive SLN and did not undergo
CLND.25 None of those patients developed an axillary
recurrence (median follow-up, 27.4 months).
Naik et al. sought to identify the rate of axillary
recurrence after SLNB in a group of 4008 patients
with breast cancer.26 In their subgroup analysis of
patients who had a positive SLN without CLND, 3 of
210 patients had axillary recurrences, which occurred
from 11 months to 46 months after diagnosis. The
size of the SLN metastasis was not reported in that
study, but it may have varied widely, because the
method of detection ranged from IHC, to frozen section, to H&E staining.
The efficacy of adjuvant treatment on the clearance of residual microscopic disease in the axillary
lymph nodes is unclear. Nearly 60% of our patients
received either adjuvant chemotherapy and/or RT
(Table 3), and a portion of the axilla was covered in
the radiation field for some of the patients in this
study. The majority of level I and II axillae can be
included in a breast-conserved radiation field when a
high tangent technique is utilized. This technique
achieves near-complete axillary coverage by extending the superior field border to within 2 cm of the

humeral head and by setting the deep field edge at
least 2 cm posterior to the lung-chest wall interface.27 In patients who receive comprehensive postmastectomy RT, axillary coverage commonly is
achieved by the combination of tangent fields
(treating the low axilla and chest wall) matched
superiorly to an appositional field (treating the supraclavicular lymph nodes and the axillary apex). Of
the 89 patients who received RT at our institution, 30
patients (15% of the entire cohort) received radiation
using the high tangent technique; and, of the entire
cohort, at least 56 patients (29%) received axillary
irradiation by this or other means.
Pejavar and colleagues retrospectively reviewed
the regional lymph node recurrence patterns of a
large cohort of patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery and received RT. Of the 1920 patients
who were analyzed in that study, 16 patients had a
positive SLN without undergoing ALND and received
RT with varying degrees of lymph node coverage. At
a minimum follow-up of 2 years and a median follow-up of 13 years, none of those 16 patients had a
lymph node failure.28
The results from a prospective study of axillary
radiation without CLND for patients with breast cancer who had a positive SLN were reported recently
by Gadd et al.29 In their study, patients with T1/
T2,N0 disease who were planning to undergo breastconservation prospectively underwent SLNB. If the

Positive SLN in Breast CA Without CLND/Hwang et al.

SLN was positive (as defined by any metastatic deposit by H&E), then the patients received RT to the
axilla without CLND. With median follow-up of 32
months, 1 of 73 patients who had a positive SLN
without CLND but with axillary RT developed an axillary recurrence. All patients received systemic therapy. Thus, RT to the axilla may be an acceptable
alternative to CLND for selected patients with positive SLNs. This approach is being tested in a European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) Phase III randomized study, which
compares axillary RT with CLND for patients with
breast cancer who have a positive SLN (the EORTC
10981/22023 AMAROS trial).30,31
In addition to the effects of adjuvant treatment
on clearance of residual axillary disease, the most
likely explanation for the absence of regional recurrences in our study population is their very low risk
of harboring additional positive axillary lymph nodes.
Based on the MSKCC nomogram,19 their risk of having positive NSLNs was <10%. According to the predictive model published by our group,16 the median
score for our study population was 20.6, which was
associated with a 100% negative predictive value.
Thus, the vast majority of these patients probably
did not have residual disease in the axilla and would
not have benefited from CLND. In addition, the relatively short follow-up of 29 months in our study is
yet another factor contributing to the absence of
observed axillary recurrences.
Although the current study and several investigations have reported a very low rate of axillary failure
for patients with a positive SLN who did not undergo
CLND, it is not possible from those results alone to
conclude definitively that CLND should be abandoned for these patients. Because almost all patients
with breast cancer undergo chemotherapy, RT, and/
or hormone therapy in addition to surgery, it is difficult to clearly dissect out the contribution of each
individual treatment modality to the extremely low
rate of locoregional recurrence that has been
reported. The American College of Surgeons Z0011
trial,11 which closed prematurely, may not have the
power to determine whether CLND is necessary for
all patients who have a positive SLN; however, the
results of the EORTC study at least will shed light on
whether RT will be an acceptable alternative to
CLND for this group of patients.
