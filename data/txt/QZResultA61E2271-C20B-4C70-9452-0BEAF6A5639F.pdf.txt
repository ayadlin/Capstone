Abstract

Author Manuscript

Growing evidence links abnormal epigenetic control to the development of hematological
malignancies. Accordingly, inhibition of epigenetic regulators is emerging as a promising
therapeutic strategy. The acetylation status of lysine residues in histone tails is one of a number of
epigenetic post-translational modifications that alter DNA-templated processes, such as
transcription, to facilitate malignant transformation. Although histone deacetylases are already
being clinically targeted, the role of histone lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) in malignancy is less
well characterized. We chose to study this question in the context of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), where, using in vitro and in vivo genetic ablation and knockdown experiments in murine
models, we demonstrate a role for the epigenetic regulators CBP and p300 in the induction and
maintenance of AML. Furthermore, using selective small molecule inhibitors of their lysine

acetyltransferase activity, we validate CBP/p300 as therapeutic targets in vitro across a wide range
of human AML subtypes. We proceed to show that growth retardation occurs through the
induction of transcriptional changes that induce apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in leukemia cells
and finally demonstrate the efficacy of the KAT inhibitors in decreasing clonogenic growth of
primary AML patient samples. Taken together, these data suggest that CBP/p300 are promising

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an often fatal hematological malignancy1 characterized
by abnormal transcriptional programs and driven by a plethora of heterogeneous mutations.2
A central and recurrent theme is mutation of epigenetic regulators.3 Among these are the
transcriptional co-activators CREB (cyclic-AMP response element binding protein)-binding
protein (CREBBP or KAT3A, hereafter referred to as CBP) and its paralogue EP300
(KAT3B, hereafter referred to as p300). CBP and p300 modulate locus-specific transcription
via a number of separate mechanisms.4 These include direct lysine acetyltransferase (KAT)
catalytic activity, where CBP and p300 can acetylate both histone and non-histone proteins,5
as well as through multiple protein–protein interactions between CBP or p300 and
transcription factors, chromatin remodelling complexes and the basal transcriptional
machinery.6 Cbp and p300 are required during development for the generation and function
of normal hematopoietic stem cells7 and we have recently shown that Cbp is also required
for adult hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and function.8 Recently, inactivating
mutations in CBP and p300 have been described in a number of hematological
malignancies9–11 and this, together with the description of germline mutations of CBP in the
cancer predisposition syndrome Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome12 and of hematological
malignancies in Cbp-deficient mice,8,13 identify CBP and p300 as tumor suppressor genes.
However, in AML, there have been reports of rearrangements of both CBP and p300 with
the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene and of CBP with the MOZ (MYST3) gene, all
leading to the generation of leukemogenic fusion proteins.14,15 Additionally, many
oncogenes have been demonstrated to interact with CBP, including the oncogenic fusions
MOZ-TIF2 and NUP98-HOXA9, MLL-AFX and TCF3-PBX.16–19 Furthermore, structure
function analysis of these fusions has demonstrated that removal of the protein domains that
interact with CBP abrogates transformation.16–17 These apparently counterintuitive data
suggest that CBP and p300 may also function as oncogenes, as has been described for other
tumor suppressor genes,20 and facilitate transformation in certain types of AML.

AML remains a disease with an overall dismal outlook, with over 70% of patients eventually
succumbing to the disease.21 In addition, the mainstays of AML therapy are unchanged for
the last 20 years.1 Therefore, novel therapeutics are urgently required to improve the longterm outlook in this aggressive disease. To this end, agents targeting epigenetic regulators,
particularly those with catalytic function, such as DNA methyltransferases and histone
deacetylase inhibitors, have recently been used with some success in AML and other
hematological malignancies.22 In addition, we and others have recently targeted so-called
‘epigenetic readers’,3 through the inhibition of protein–protein interactions between
acetylated histone tails and the BET protein family of transcriptional activators.23 However,

the role of histone acetyltransferase activity has not been systematically investigated, nor
targeted in AML. In this report, we support this strategy by demonstrating that Cbp and
p300 are genetically required for efficient leukemogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that
pharmacologically targeting the catalytic activity of the lysine acetyltransferases (KAT)
CBP and p300 has pre-clinical efficacy in many subtypes of AML. This occurs via the
induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitors
in similar assays. Mechanistically, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis appear to be mediated
through alteration of a transcriptional program associated with genomic integrity. Finally we
demonstrate a significant decrement of clonogenic growth in AML patient samples
following CBP/p300 KAT inhibition. Taken together, these data suggest targeting CBP/
p300 activity as a promising clinical strategy in AML.

RESULTS
Author Manuscript

Cbp is required for efficient immortalization in vitro and induction and maintenance of
AML in vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To assess the requirement for Cbp during transformation, we retrovirally transduced c-kit+
bone marrow (BM) cells from Cbpfl/fl; Mx1-Cre− mice (hereafter Cbp wt) or Cbpfl/fl;Mx1Cre+ mice following administration of poly-I poly-C (pIpC) (hereafter Cbp−/−), with AMLassociated oncogenes MOZ-TIF2 (MT2) or NUP98-HOXA9 (NHA9), both of which are
known to interact with CBP. Transformation was assessed in standard serial replating and
growth in liquid culture assays.24 No differences in colony numbers or growth were
demonstrated between MT2 and NHA9 Cbp wt or Cbp−/− progenitor cells (Figure 1a),
suggesting that in vitro immortalization by MT2 and NHA9 is not absolutely dependent on
Cbp expression, and may proceed in its absence. We next examined whether Cbp is required
for continued in vitro self-renewal in cell lines expressing MT2 and NHA9. Cbpfl/fl c-kit+
progenitor cells were first transduced with either MT2 or NHA9 and serially replated in
methylcellulose. Similar cells expressing MLL-ENL (ME), a fully transforming fusion
protein not documented to interact with CBP, were included as a control. Following the third
round of plating, cells were transduced with pBabe-Cre-puro retrovirus to excise Cbp in
vitro, or with a puro-empty vector as a control, before further serial plating under initial
puromycin selection. Although transduction with Cre recombinase did not significantly alter
the self-renewal potential in any cell line at the population level (Figure 1b and data not
shown), genotyping of the cells revealed preferential growth by cells that lacked
recombination and therefore still expressed Cbp, demonstrating its involvement in
transformation. Importantly, by the third and fourth round of plating, almost all cells
immortalized by NHA9 and MT2 demonstrated the non-recombined allele, suggesting a
selective advantage for cells that retained Cbp (Figure 1c). In contrast, cells expressing ME
demonstrated efficient and sustained excision of Cbp (Figure 1c and data not shown). Taken
together, these strongly suggest that loss of Cbp may affect the self-renewal programs
maintained by oncogenes that interact with it, including MT2 and NHA9, but not by those
that do not interact with Cbp, as exemplified by ME.
We next assessed the requirement for Cbp during the initiation and maintenance of leukemia
in vivo, using the short latency MT2 AML model.16,24 To test the requirement for Cbp

during leukemia initiation, c-kit+ BM cells from previously pIpC-treated Cbp wt or Cbp−/−
mice were transduced with MSCV-MT2-IRES-GFP (Figure 2a). The transduction efficiency
between Cbp wt and Cbp−/− cells (as measured by the percentage of GFP+ cells) was similar
and genotyping of the transduced cells revealed excision of the Cbp allele (Figure 2a) before
transplantation. All MT2 mice succumbed to disease within 2–4 months after
transplantation, with a similar macroscopic and histological AML phenotype (Figure 2a;
Supplementary Figure 1). However, similarly to the findings in vitro, genotyping from
various heavily infiltrated tissues of the leukemic mice from the Cbp−/− group demonstrated
that the majority of cells actually retained the non-recombined Cbpfl/fl allele and therefore
expressed Cbp. Indeed, when these populations were enriched for leukemic cells, by sorting
for GFP, all cells lacked recombination at the Cbp allele (Figure 2a). Thus, in agreement
with our in vitro studies, there is a significant growth advantage during leukemia induction
for cells that continue to express Cbp.

We next examined whether Cbp is required for maintenance of leukemia. c-kit+ BM cells
were isolated from Cbpfl/fl;Mx1-Cre+ mice (not previously treated with pIpC). These cells
were transduced with MSCV-MT2-IRES-GFP and transplanted into lethally irradiated
recipient mice (Figure 2b). Leukemic cells were harvested from primary mice and further
transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated secondary recipients. Five doses of pIpC were
administered to half of the recipient mice, starting at 10 days post-transplantation to allow
for proper engraftment, with control mice receiving no treatment. Mice from the untreated
group succumbed to disease between 19 and 35 days later (Figure 2b). By contrast, only
40% of the mice from the pIpC-treated group died from disease, although they did so with a
similar latency. In the remaining pIpC-treated mice, no GFP-positive cells could be detected
in the peripheral blood on serial testing, nor were Cbpfl/fl or recombined alleles detected by
genotyping and no disease was evident at the termination of the experiment on day 120
(Figure 2b and data not shown). Thus, similarly to our in vitro replating assays, loss of Cbp
in vivo compromises effective induction and maintenance of MT2-associated AML.
Functional redundancy exists between Cbp and p300 during myeloid transformation

Author Manuscript

Cbp and its closely related paralogue p300 have similar, but also unique functions.7 We
hypothesized that p300 may partially compensate for Cbp loss and explain why Cbp was not
an absolute requirement for immortalization in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we knocked
down p300, using two lentiviral shRNAs (sh747 and sh1945) in Cbp wt and Cbp−/− cells
immortalized by MT2 or NHA9. Modest knockdown (up to 60% of mRNA, sh747, Figure
3a) of p300 in Cbp wt MT2 expressing cells decreased the numbers of colonies in
methylcellulose culture, in comparison with cells expressing a control shRNA construct that
targets luciferase (Figure 3b). This decrease was even more marked in Cbp−/− cells (Figure
3b), with similar results also demonstrated in the NHA9 cell line (Figure 3b). Taken
together, our data suggest functional redundancy between Cbp and p300, which cooperate to
facilitate the maintenance of self-renewal programs in cells immortalized by the AMLassociated fusion proteins MT2 and NHA9.

Inhibition of the KAT activity of CBP/p300 suppresses the growth of multiple AML
subtypes through the induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis

Author Manuscript

To bypass the functional redundancy between Cbp and p300 and to determine whether other
subtypes of AML also require CBP/p300, we employed a pharmacological strategy that
utilized a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of CBP and p300 KAT activity, C646
(Supplementary Figure 2A).25 Initially, all experiments were conducted with both an
inactive structural analog of C646, C37 and vehicle control (DMSO), but as responses to
C37 and DMSO were identical, we continued only with DMSO as a control (Supplementary
Figure 2B and data not shown). We first demonstrated that C646 treatment was not
associated with any significant toxicity to normal murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells in colony formation, colony composition and in serial replating assays up to a dosage
of 30 μM (Figure 4a and data not shown). All subsequent assays were therefore performed at
a dosage of 20 μM. At this dosage, we demonstrated significant inhibition of growth for
MT2 and NHA9 immortalized cell lines in liquid culture and in methylcellulose colony
assays (Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure 3A). We extended this analysis to a panel of
human AML cell lines representative of common oncogenic driver mutations (Figure 4c and
Supplementary Table 1). Growth rates for 10 separate cell lines were assessed in liquid
culture assays (DMSO vs C646). As demonstrated in Figure 4c, 8 cell lines demonstrated a
significant reduction in growth, with 7/10 cell lines demonstrating a greater than 50%
reduction in growth in liquid culture following C646 treatment. Similarly, in methylcellulose
assays, colony growth was significantly reduced in 8/10 and by greater than 50% in 5/10 cell
lines (Figure 4d). Taken together, these results demonstrate significant efficacy for CBP/
p300 KAT inhibition across a number of AML subtypes.

Author Manuscript

To further determine the cellular consequences of KAT inhibition, we performed apoptosis
and cell-cycle analysis post-C646 treatment. Inhibition with C646 was associated with a
variable induction of apoptosis at 72 h (Figure 4e and Supplementary Figure 3C). There was
no induction of apoptosis in normal human CD34+ cells in liquid culture at similar dosage
(Figure 6b). A modest alteration of cell cycle was observed with induction of G1/G0 arrest in
the responsive, but not in the resistant cell lines (Figure 4f).
Inhibition of CBP/p300 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity in human leukemia cells
alters a transcriptional program associated with genomic integrity

Author Manuscript

To determine the critical transcriptional programs altered in AML cells that mediate cellcycle arrest and cell death, we analyzed global gene expression patterns following treatment
with C646 or DMSO control, in two sensitive (Kasumi-1 and KG-1) and one resistant
(K562) cell lines. Gene expression was assessed 24 h post treatment, a time point before the
induction of significant apoptosis or cell-cycle alteration (Supplementary Figure 4).
Significant differential gene expression changes (false discovery rate < 5%; fold change: ±
1.5-fold (Log2 scale)) were noted for 348 and 231 genes in the sensitive cells lines KG-1 and
Kasumi-1, respectively, and for 47 genes for the resistant cell line K562 (Figure 5a). There
was a high correlation between the deregulated genes in the two sensitive cell lines (KG-1
and Kasumi-1, (P < 2.2− 16) (Figure 5b), suggesting that KAT inhibition generates specific
rather than general transcriptional changes. Ninety-eight genes were commonly
differentially expressed in the two sensitive cell lines. To further prioritize gene expression

changes associated with sensitivity to C646, 11 genes that were also differentially expressed
in the resistant cell line K562 were subtracted from this gene list (Figure 5c). When the GO
terms for the remaining 87 genes (57 genes downregulated and 30 genes upregulated, Figure
5d and Supplementary Table 2) were examined, there was significant enrichment for genes
involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, the control of mitosis and the cell cycle (Figure
5d). Moreover, 43% (38/87) of these genes have been previously identified as direct p300
targets (p300 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data from the ENCODE project,26
Supplementary Table 2). In agreement with the histone acetyltransferase function of CBP/
p300, transcriptional repression was accompanied by reduced H3K18Ac levels in the
promoter region of selected candidate genes, as validated by ChIP-PCR (Figure 5e) 24 h
post KAT inhibition. The differential (and sensitive cell line-specific) expression pattern fits
well with the cellular consequences observed following HAT inhibition. These findings are
also in agreement with previous observations of a cell-cycle defect upon Cbp deletion in
normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.8 Gene set enrichment analysis corroborated
that DNA replication and cell-cycle progression are affected upon KAT inhibition, as the
treated vs untreated profiles were significantly enriched for genes involved in those
processes (Supplementary Figure 5).
CBP/p300 KAT inhibitors decrease growth of primary human AML samples

Author Manuscript

Finally, the efficacy of KAT inhibition was tested in primary human AML samples.
Importantly, no evidence of C646 toxicity to normal CD34+ cells was seen in
methylcellulose or apoptosis assays (Figures 6a and b). However, in primary blasts from a
large set of AML patients a markedly different pattern was demonstrated. C646 was tested
on 29 AML cases harboring a number of differing molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities.
Similar to the effects seen in AML cell lines, a significant reduction in clonogenic potential
was demonstrated in the majority of patient samples (P = 0.0004, Figure 6c). Indeed, 65% of
samples (19/29) across a number of AML molecular subtypes, including those associated
with a poor prognosis, demonstrated a significant (>50%) reduction in colony number
(Figure 6d and Supplementary Figure 6).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Survival rates for AML patients are dismal, with over 70% of patients eventually
succumbing to the disease. This statistic has not been helped by the recent lack of novel
therapeutics developed for AML. Agents with efficacy against specific molecular subtypes,
including ATRA for acute promyelocytic leukemia,23 the toxin-conjugated anti-CD33
antibody Myelotarg for core-binding factor mutated AML27 and FLT3 inhibitors for patients
with activating FLT3 mutations28 have shown promising effects in specific subtypes of
AML. However, agents with effects against a wider number of AML subtypes have failed to
emerge. Recently, inhibitors of epigenetic regulators have demonstrated promise in
hematopoietic malignancies. In this report, we present data supporting the role of the
epigenetic regulators CBP/p300 in AML pathogenesis and, using pharmacological inhibition
of their KAT activity in preclinical studies identify these proteins as therapeutic targets
across a wide range of AML subtypes.

Our genetic experiments using in vitro and in vivo murine models of leukemia were strongly
suggestive of a Cbp role in AML induction and maintenance. This was further supported by
our shRNA assays, which suggested and addressed the compensatory role of p300 following
Cbp loss. To bypass the limitations of these genetic approaches and therapeutically validate
these results, we utilized a small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets both CBP and
p300 KAT activity, thus allowing dissection of the relative roles of their catalytic activity
and their non-catalytic protein scaffold functions in leukemogenesis. We encountered no
evidence of toxicity to normal hematopoiesis (murine and human cells) in our in vitro
assays. This is in keeping with the mild hematopoietic phenotype we observed in vivo under
homeostatic conditions following acute Cbp deletion.8 Of note, the hematopoietic phenotype
of mice carrying a KAT defective mutant of p300 is minimal, whereas mice with a p300
KIX-domain mutant allele, predicted to abrogate multiple protein-protein interactions,
demonstrate a marked hematopoietic phenotype.29

Author Manuscript

Also supportive of a lack of general toxicity were the specific gene expression changes
observed following treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of CBP and p300 affected specific
and partially overlapping programs in two sensitive cell lines. Many of these differentially
expressed genes are involved in DNA integrity and cell-cycle control. These alterations are
in keeping with the proposed role of CBP and p300 in other DNA-templated processes,
including repair, replication and recombination.30 In particular, multiple members of the
minichromosome maintenance pre-replication complex (MCM3, MCM4 and MCM5), as
well as its interacting proteins (MCM10) and loading/regulatory factors for replication
origin licensing (CDT1 and GMNN) were downregulated in sensitive, but not in resistant
cell lines. These data would also, at least partially, explain the observed altered cellular
phenotype of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Although the exact mechanism(s) whereby CBP and p300 inhibition alter transcription in
AML remains unknown, a number of non-mutually exclusive mechanisms could be
envisaged. CBP and p300 are known to interact with multiple hematopoietic transcription
factors and also with known oncogenes, therefore inhibition of direct co-activator function
for driver oncogenes may underlie effects in certain AML subtypes. Our genetic
experiments in MOZ-TIF2 and NUP98-HOXA9 support this, as do reports of the efficacy in
acute leukemias of small molecule inhibitors that directly target the interaction between
CBP and/or p300 and β-Catenin31 and the observation that nearly half of the differentially
expressed genes following CBP/p300 KAT inhibition are direct targets of p300, as shown by
ChIP-Seq data deposited in the ENCODE database. Another possibility is that these
inhibitors target CBP and p300 co-activator activity at critical transcriptional mediators
downstream of oncogenic mutations. Finally, lysine acetylation of non-histone proteins
mediated by CBP and/or p300 has been suggested to facilitate leukemogenesis. In support of
this concept, targeting KAT activity in AML1-ETO positive leukemia cells led to decreased
leukemia growth associated with decreased site-specific AML1-ETO acetylation.32
Furthermore, AML1-ETO proteins mutated to prevent site-specific acetylation were poorly
transforming in vivo and AML1-ETO positive patient samples and cell lines are sensitive to
CBP/p300 inhibition.33 Thus, acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins by CBP

and p300 may facilitate leukemogenesis. Further investigations are warranted, therefore, to
address the specific role of these mechanisms in transformation in individual AML subtypes.

Author Manuscript

Unfortunately, the C646 HAT inhibitor lacks sufficient potency and shows unfavorable
pharmacokinetic properties (unpublished data) to allow effective dosing in vivo. However,
Cbp ablation in vivo significantly impeded leukemic growth. In addition, the majority of
AML cell lines and most AML patient samples, including those with a number of poor risk
genetic characteristics (including FLT3-ITD, TP53, DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1 mutations
and EVI-1 and TP53 rearrangements, as documented by directed NGS in some patients,
Figure 6d), demonstrated a significant decrease in clonogenic growth upon inhibitor
treatment in vitro. Importantly, no significant toxicity was seen in normal murine and human
hematopoietic cells treated with the same dose of inhibitor. Taken together, our in vivo
genetic data and pharmacological in vitro data suggest promising efficacy in targeting CBP
and p300 function in AML. Therefore, novel potent and specific agents, optimized for in
vivo use, are urgently required to validate the promising efficacy and lack of toxicity of
CBP/p300 KAT inhibition, and to move this potential treatment paradigm toward clinical
testing in AML. However, as a note of caution, if efficacy is demonstrated, due to the
association of CBP and p300 loss with tumor induction and a chemo-resistant
phenotype,9–11 caution will be warranted as to how CBP/p300 inhibitors can best be
integrated into combination therapies for AML.

Cbp−/− cells are rapidly outcompeted by Cbp wt cells, under selective in vitro conditions, in
MT2- and NHA9-driven AML. (a) Serial replating assays of MT2- and NHA9-driven
leukemias demonstrate no difference in colony number or serial replating activity between
transduced Cbp wt and Cbp−/− progenitor cells. (b) Similar replating assays demonstrate no
differences in the in vitro self-renewal potential of MT2 and NHA9 AML murine cell lines
generated from Cbpfl/fl progenitors following expression of either Cre-puro or an empty
puro vector, as both cell lines retained serial replating potential post-Cbp excision. (c)
Genotyping of pooled colonies at the end of each round of replating revealed serial reemergence of the un-excised Cbp allele, in the NHA9 and MT2, but not in the ME
immortalized murine cell lines. *P < 0.05.

Cbp confers a selective advantage during initiation/progression of MT2-driven AML, under
selective in vivo conditions. (a) Cbp wt and Cbp−/− progenitor cells were transduced with
MT2 and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Genotyping of the Cbp wt and
Cbp−/− progenitor cells post-transduction confirmed almost complete excision of the Cbp
allele. However, genotyping of leukemic cells revealed reemergence and clonal expansion of
the un-excised Cbp allele. Furthermore, enrichment of leukemic cells via GFP sorting
demonstrated only non-recombined cells, suggesting that Cbp loss confers a significant
growth disadvantage during leukemia induction. All recipient mice succumbed to AML
within 4 months post-transplantation. (b) c-kit+ Cbpfl/fl;Mx1-Cre+ BM cells were
transduced with MT2 and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. The leukemias that
arose in the primary recipients were transplanted into secondary animals. Excision of the
Cbp allele in the secondary recipient animals resulted in decreased penetration of disease
(only 40% of animals developed AML). Representative flow cytometry demonstrates that no
GFP+ cells could be detected in the peripheral blood of non-diseased animals at the end of
the experiment (d120).

Pharmacological inhibition of CBP and P300 suppresses the growth and decreases
clonogenic potential of multiple AML cell lines in vitro. (a) C646 treatment of normal
murine BM cells (n = 3) does not lead to significant changes of the number, or the types of
colonies produced in serial replating assays. (b) C646 suppresses the growth of the NHA9
immortalized murine cell line in liquid culture and in methylcellulose assays. (c) Ten
different human AML cell lines were tested against C646, over a period of 12 days in liquid
culture conditions. The majority of these were responsive to C646 treatment (e.g.,

compared with DMSO control. Two cell lines showed no response to CBP/p300 KAT
inhibition (K562 and MOLM13). (d) Similarly, methylcellulose assays revealed a
significant decrease in clonogenic potential in 8/10 human AML cell lines treated with
C646. (e) Treatment with C646 induces apoptosis in the sensitive (Kasumi-1) but not in the
resistant (K562) cell lines, as measured by Annexin/7-AAD staining. (f) Induction of
apoptosis in the sensitive cell lines is accompanied by a modest G1 cell-cycle arrest
(assessed by PI staining), however this is lacking in the resistant K562 cell line. *P < 0.05;
