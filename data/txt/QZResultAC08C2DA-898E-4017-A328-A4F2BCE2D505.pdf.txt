ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive brain tumor in the central
nervous system, remains a lethal diagnosis with a median survival of < 15 months.
Aberrant expression of the TRPM7 channel has been linked to GBM functions. In this
study, using the human GBM cell line U87, we evaluated the TRPM7 activator naltriben
on GBM viability, migration, and invasiveness. First, using the whole-cell patch-clamp
technique, we showed that naltriben enhanced the endogenous TRPM7-like current
in U87 cells. In addition, with Fura-2 Ca2+ imaging, we observed robust Ca2+ influx
following naltriben application. Naltriben significantly enhanced U87 cell migration
and invasion (assessed with scratch wound assays, Matrigel invasion experiments,
and MMP-2 protein expression), but not viability and proliferation (evaluated with
MTT assays). Using Western immunoblots, we also detected the protein levels of
p-Akt/t-Akt, and p-ERK1|2/t-ERK1|2. We found that naltriben enhanced the MAPK/
ERK signaling pathway, but not the PI3k/Akt pathway. Therefore, potentiated TRPM7
activity contributes to the devastating migratory and invasive characteristics of GBM.

INTRODUCTION

Expressed ubiquitously in almost all tissues, TRPM7
is a non-specific divalent cation channel that serves as a
Ca2+ conductor, and belongs to the melastatin subfamily
within the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel
superfamily. Ion channels comprise an important target
class for drug development. TRPM7 has been indicated as
a potential therapeutic target for GBM [4–7] in addition to
other cancer types, including: pancreatic cancer, leukemia,
head and neck cancer, prostate cancer, retinoblastoma,
nasopharyngeal cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer,
and breast cancer [8–13]. Previous studies [4–7] have
suggested that the involvement of TRPM7 in GBM is
due to the channel’s aberrant activity and up-regulation
in the cancerous tissues by using techniques to reduce
TRPM7 functions (i.e. knock down, or pharmacological
inhibition). However, there is no report in the literature
examining whether potentiation of TRPM7 channel
activity would enhance GBM functions (i.e. proliferation,
migration and invasion).

With a 5-year survival rate of < 10% (NEJM
352:987–996, 2005), glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal
progressive brain tumor. GBM unrestrictedly proliferates
and invades throughout the brain tissue by degrading
the extracellular matrix, contributing to its considerable
treatment resistance [1]. Therapeutic options for GBM
patients are extremely limited and with unsatisfactory
outcomes [2]. The standard treatment is surgical resection
of the tumor, followed by temozolomide and radiation [1].
However, due to the lack of specificity, the currently used
adjuvants are highly cytotoxic [3]. Further research is
necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying GBM
functions in order to discover alternatives which kill tumors
while sparing healthy cells. In essence, we need to better
understand the involvement of the potential therapeutic
targets for GBM if we hope to develop treatments that are
highly specific to GBM with minimal toxicity.

Until recently, reliable pharmacological compounds
that can serve as specific TRPM7 agonists were unavailable.
A set of 20 small molecules with various structural
backbones that can induce TRPM7 currents was screened
using a Ca2+ imaging-based assay [14]. Compared to the
other compounds, the δ opioid antagonist naltriben was
the most selective TRPM7 positive gating modulator. The
EC50 of naltriben for TRPM7 was calculated to be ~20 μM;
at 50 μM, naltriben had no effects on other TRP channels,
including TRPM2, TRPM8 and TRPV1 [14]. In addition,
the authors found that naltriben reversibly activated
TRPM7 channels even in low PIP2 conditions and without
intracellular Mg2+ depletion. Using a series of mutagenesis
experiments, the authors also showed that the site of TRPM7
activation by naltriben resided in the TRP domain. Originally
used as an antagonist of δ opioid receptors [15], it should be
noted that although naltriben shows high structural similarity
with other opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrindole),
none of the others can stimulate TRPM7 channels.
The current study evaluated the involvement of
TRPM7 on GBM functions through a novel approach. That
is, we assessed whether potentiating TRPM7 activity with
naltriben would enhance U87 cell viability, migration and
invasion. In addition, we explored the underlying potential
mechanisms by studying the signaling pathways involved.
We used MTT, scratch wound, and Matrigel invasion
assays, combined with Western immunoblots, Ca2+ imaging,
and patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine the effects of
naltriben on the functional outcomes of U87 cells.

TRPM7-like currents. Here, in order to further verify
that the effects of naltriben are mediated by TRPM7, we
used carvacrol to examine whether it can also inhibit the
naltriben-potentiated TRPM7-like currents in U87 cells.
Figure 1D–1F illustrate that the TRPM7-like currents
potentiated by naltriben are inhibited by carvacrol, which
reduced the TRPM7-like current to 6.8 ± 1.7 pA/pF. Our
results provide evidence that the endogenous TRPM7-like
currents in U87 cells are sensitive to naltriben potentiation.

Prolonged (24 h) naltriben-treatment is cytotoxic
likely due to sustained Ca2+ influx
Next, we assessed with the MTT assay whether
naltriben affected U87 cell viability. Figure 2A shows that
treatment with naltriben for 24 h reduced U87 cell viability in
a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.0001; n = 18). This suggests
a pathophysiological effect of prolonged TRPM7 activation
due to sustained Ca2+ influx resulting in Ca2+ imbalance and
ultimately cell death. The cytotoxic effects of Ca2+ imbalance
are well documented [17–20], and cancer cells are not
excepted [21–23]. To determine the effect of naltriben on
TRPM7 Ca2+ dynamics, we performed Fura-2 ratiometric
Ca2+ imaging on U87 cells, as described previously [24, 25].
As shown in Figure 2B, in the basal solution, the perfusion
of U87 cells with 50 μM naltriben resulted in an increase
of 340/380 ratio by 0.65 ± 0.04 (n = 24) from the baseline
level. Subsequent perfusion of 50 μM naltriben after washout
increased the ratio by 0.53 ± 0.05 (n = 21) from the baseline
level, suggesting that there is no sensitization of TRPM7 Ca2+
current to repeated applications of naltriben. This illustrates
that naltriben-treatment can elicit robust and sustained Ca2+
responses in U87 cells.

RESULTS
Endogenous TRPM7-like currents in U87 cells
are potentiated by naltriben

U87 cell migration and invasion are enhanced by
naltriben

We have previously reported that the TRPM7
channel mRNA and protein expressions, and its activity
are upregulated in the U87 cells compared to normal
human astrocytes [4]. Activation of TRPM7 currents
by naltriben have previously been confirmed in primary
ventricular myocytes [16], as well as in HEK293 cells
overexpressing TRPM7 [14]. In the current study, we
first verified the potentiating effect of naltriben on the
endogenous TRPM7-like currents in U87 cells by wholecell patch-clamp recording. Figure 1A and 1B show that
naltriben (50 μM) perfusion resulted in the activation of
robust TRPM7-like currents. Consistent with the shape
and characteristics of TRPM7, the naltriben-activated
currents were large and rectified outwardly [4]. Activation
by naltriben was readily reversible because the TRPM7like current decreased with washout of naltriben. As
Figure 1C shows, the initial outward current density at
100 mV was 9.7 ± 2.4 pA/pF, and naltriben significantly
potentiated the TRPM7-like current to 31.3 ± 4.9 pA/
pF (p < 0.001; n = 6). In our previous study [4], we
reported that 300 μM carvacrol inhibits the basal U87

The scratch wound assay and the Matrigel invasion
assay were used to evaluate if naltriben-treatment had an
effect on U87 cell migration and invasion, respectively. To
assess cell migration in vitro, the scratch wound assay is
a well documented procedure [26]. In Figure 3A and 3B,
images of the migrating cells were captured at 0, 4, 8, and
12 hours after treatment with 50 μM naltriben, followed
by analysis of the wound gap. In the control group,
the wound closure was 21.2 ± 3.9%, 27.7 ± 8.1%, and
44.3 ± 5.9% (n = 6) at 4, 8, and 12 hours, respectively.
This was slower than the wound closure in the naltribentreated group at the corresponding time points: 49.1
± 2.8%, 92.6 ± 4.3%, and 98.7 ± 0.2% (p < 0.01; n = 10).
Our results indicate that naltriben significantly enhanced
U87 cell migration. In Figure 3C and 3D, results from the
Matrigel invasion assays show that U87 cell invasion after
12 h was significantly enhanced with naltriben (50 μM)
treatment (89 ± 3 cells versus 127 ± 5 cells in the control
and naltriben groups, respectively; p < 0.01; n = 6).

ERK signaling, but not the PI3K/Akt pathway

levels, densitometry analysis shows that p-ERK1/2 levels
(Figure  4C) are significantly increased by naltriben
(42.2 ± 7.7% versus 79.5 ± 8.9% in the control and
naltriben groups, respectively; p < 0.05; n = 3), while no
change in t-ERK1/2 levels (Figure 4D). The p-ERK1|2/
t-ERK1|2 ratio (Figure 4E) was greater in the naltriben
group (22.7 ± 5.2% versus 57.8 ± 9.3% in the control and
naltriben groups, respectively; p < 0.05; n = 3). On the
contrary, naltriben-treatment had no effect on p-Akt levels
(Figure 4F), t-Akt levels (Figure 4G), or the p-Akt/t-Akt
ratio (Figure 4H). This is suggestive that MAPK/ERK,
but not PI3K/Akt, signaling is involved in the naltribeninduced enhancement in U87 migration and invasion.

Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have reported
greater migration and invasion in GBM with higher
MMP-2 protein levels [1, 2, 27]. To assess whether
naltriben enhances U87 migration and invasion via an
MMP-2-dependent mechanism, we measured MMP-2
protein levels with Western immunoblots. As shown in
Figure 4A and 4B, treatment of U87 with 50 µM naltriben
for 24 h upregulated MMP-2 protein level (88.3 ± 28.2%
versus 226.6 ± 25.1% in the control and naltriben groups,
respectively; p < 0.05; n = 3).
The MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades
are involved in many functions of GBM, including
proliferation, migration, and invasion. Previously, we
have shown that pharmacological block or knock-down
of TRPM7 inhibited both pathways [4,5]. In the current
study, potentiation of TRPM7 by naltriben upregulated
p-ERK1/2 protein levels (Figure 4A, 4C), but not p-Akt
levels (Figure 4A, 4F). When normalized to β-actin

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we report that naltriben: 1)
potentiates endogenous TRPM7 channel activity and induces
Ca2+ influx in the widely used U87 human glioblastoma
(GBM) cell line; 2) enhances U87 migration and invasion;
and 3) upregulates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.

Previously, we reported that the TRPM7 mRNA
and protein, as well as channel activity are upregulated in
the U87 cells compared to normal human astrocytes [4].
In the current study, we found that naltriben further
augmented the TRPM7-like currents in U87 cells. The
robust TRPM7 potentiation was stable until washout of
naltriben, which was consistent with what other groups
reported for TRPM7 overexpressed HEK293 cells or
primary ventricular myocytes [14, 16]. For GBM, this is
suggestive that although there is already an upregulation of

basal TRPM7 activity compared to normal astrocytes, the
channel can be further stimulated. The broader implication
is that endogenous physiological or pathophysiological
signaling pathways in GBM that positively modulate
TRPM7 would enhance cancer migration and invasion.
Ultimately, this would have devastating outcomes for the
prognosis of patients with GBM.
Furthermore, we observed that the matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) protein levels were
increased when TRPM7 channel activity was potentiated

by naltriben. This is consistent with our previous
studies [4, 5], where we reported MMP-2 levels decreased
following TRPM7 inhibition. In cancer cells, MMP-2
is localized in the invadosomes where it contributes
to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby
assisting in the invasion process [28]. The present study
showed that increasing TRPM7 activity enhanced GBM
invasiveness potentially through MMP-2 upregulation,
whereas our previous studies showed the vice-versa for
TRPM7 inhibition [4, 5]. Taking our current findings
in combination with our previous reports, there is
strong evidence that TRPM7 activity regulates MMP-2
expression as the underlying mechanism linking the
channel to the aggressive invasiveness of GBM.

Two important signaling cascades that play critical
roles in proliferation, migration and invasion of GBM are
the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. Because these
signaling pathways are overactive in many human cancers
in addition to GBM [29–32], the discovery of effective
Akt and ERK inhibitors has garnered attention. Currently,
there are clinical trials evaluating drugs that inhibit the
PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways [27].
Interestingly, patient response to treatments inhibiting only
one of these signaling pathways is unsatisfactory [33].
This suggests that there is perhaps crosstalk between the
PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways, and a more effective
strategy in the treatment of GBM would be to target an
upstream regulator of both these pathways. Several studies

showed that TRPM7 regulates the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/
ERK pathways in a variety of cell types. Knock-down
of TRPM7 in hepatic stellate cells prevented an increase
in p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 levels following induction by
PDGF-BB [34]. Additionally, silencing TRPM7 in
OVCA cells or human lung fibroblast decreased the level
of p-Akt, and in breast cancer cells, p-ERK1/2 was reduced
[13, 35, 36]. In GBM, our lab previously showed that silencing
or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM7 reduced the levels
of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2, and consequently, downregulated the
PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways [4, 5].
Therefore, based on these studies, we rationalized
that potentiation of TRPM7 by naltriben would upregulate
these pathways. However, in the present study, we found
that although the expression of p-ERK increased, there
was no change in the phosphorylation of Akt, which is
a key protein of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We
have several explanations to account for this lack of
change. Because the PI3K/Akt pathway can also be
regulated by other ion channels aberrantly expressed in
GBM, such as the TRPML-2 channel [37], potentiation
in TRPM7 activity alone might not be sufficient to
further upregulate the already excessive activation of

PI3K/Akt. Furthermore, the main functional outcome
of the overactive PI3K/Akt pathway in cancer cells is
apoptosis prevention and proliferation promotion [38].
The unchanged PI3K/Akt signaling is consistent with our
viability experiments, where we showed that potentiating
TRPM7 with naltriben did not increase GBM viability. In
fact, naltriben-treatment slightly decreased U87 viability
in a dose-dependent manner, which we hypothesize to be
due to sustained and prolonged (24 h) Ca2+ influx. This is
based on the rationale that other groups have also shown
that prolonged activation of TRPM channels can lead to
Ca2+ imbalance resulting in cancer cell death [39–41]. The
MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, on the other hand, has
been shown to strongly contribute to the invasiveness of
cancer cells in addition to proliferation [42]. Our current
findings, where we saw increased GBM invasion alongside
upregulated p-ERK levels following TRPM7 potentiation
with naltriben, are consistent. Nonetheless, the molecular
mechanism by which TRPM7 interacts with the MAPK/
ERK pathway remains unclear. Because both MAPK/ERK
and PI3K/Akt signaling can be regulated by phospholipase
C [43], we speculate the involvement of TRPM7-associated
PLC isozymes that interact with the TRPM7 α-type Ser/Thr

protein kinase domain [44] (a schematic model is shown in
Figure 5). Further investigation is necessary to elucidate this.
In summary, potentiation of TRPM7 channel activity
with naltriben enhanced U87 migration and invasion,
likely through upregulating MMP-2 protein expression
as well as MAPK/ERK signaling. Our findings provide
further evidence suggesting TRPM7 as a therapeutic target
for GBM treatment.

Figure 5: Schematic model illustrating the cellular signaling involved in the effects of TRPM7 potentiation on U87
migration and invasion. The TRPM7 channel can respond to extracellular or cytosolic stimuli through regulation of Ca2+ and Mg2+
influx. In addition, TRPM7 contains a self-phosphorylating α-type Ser/Thr protein kinase domain that also modulates the phosphorylation
of other cytosolic substrates such as PLC, which in turn, can regulate MAPK/ERK signaling. Consequently, functional gene transcription
and translation are affected. Naltriben potentiates TRPM7, which upregulates MAPK/ERK signaling, and ultimately enhances U87
migration and invasion.

-100 to +100 mV (5 s interval) at 2 kHz (digitized at 5 kHz)
was used. Data acquisition and analyses were done with
the software pClamp 9.2 and Clampfit 9.2, respectively.
All recordings were done at room temperature. The
resistance of pipettes was between 5–10 MΩ after filling
with pipette (intracellular) solution, which contained (in
mM): 145 CsMSF, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, with the
pH adjusted to 7.2 using CsOH. The bath (extracellular)
solution had (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 20
HEPES, 10 glucose, with pH adjusted to 7.4 and osmolarity
to ~300 mOsm using NaOH and sucrose, respectively.

created on the monolayer of cells with a 200 μL pipette tip.
Cells were treated with either vehicle (0.1% DMSO; control)
or 50 μM naltriben for up to 24 h. Images of the cells were
taken from the same visual field throughout the experiment
via a phase-contrast Olympus microscope (CKX41, ×10
objective). Quantification of wound closure was as follows:
percentage of closure = Gap(T-T0)/GapT0*100% (where T
= treatment duration; T0 = initial scratch).

Matrigel invasion assay
U87 cell invasion was evaluated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for the Corning Matrigel invasion
chambers (8-μm polycarbonate Nucleopore filters, cat#
354480, BD Biosciences). After treating cells with vehicle
(0.1% DMSO; control) or 50 μM naltriben for 24 h, 100 μL
of cells (2.5 × 104 cells/mL) in FBS-free DMEM was added
to the top chamber. The bottom chamber contained 600 μL
of complete medium to serve as a chemoattractant. Cells that
are invading would degrade the Matrigel and migrate to the
lower membrane surface of the top chamber. Invaded cells
were then fixed in 100% methanol and stained with Toluidine
blue (1%). Images were then captured with a digital camera
through an Olympus microscope (CKX41). Quantification of
invading cells was with the ImageJ software.

Ca2+ imaging
A Fura-2 ratiometric Ca2+ imaging system as used
to measure intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) as described
previously [24, 25]. In the dark at room temperature,
cells were preloaded with Fura-2 AM (2 μM) for 30 min.
Using a Deltaram V single monochromator controlled by
EasyRatioPro (PTI), Fura-2 Ca2+ signal was acquired at
alternate excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. U87
cells were perfused with basal solution, which contained (in
mM): 129 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, 30 glucose,
and 5 KCl (with pH adjusted to 7.3–7.4 and osmolarity
to 320–330 mOsm), with or without 50 μM naltriben. An
intensified charged-coupled device (ICCD) camera (PTI)
digitized the signals. EasyRatioPro was used to calculate
the fluorescence intensity (Poenie-Tsien) ratios of images.

Western immunoblot
Western immunoblots were conducted as previously
described [4, 5]. In summary, cells were harvested in RIPA
buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (in mM: 50
Tris, 150 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 1 PMSF, 1 Na3VO4, 1 NaF; and
1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% C24H39NaO4, 1 μg/ mL
aprotinin, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL pepstatin). The
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to measure
the protein concentration of samples. Protein samples
of equivalent amounts were then separated in an 8 or
12% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Blocking
was done with freshly prepared 5% milk, and then the
membrane was immunoblotted overnight (4°C) with the
following primary antibodies: anti-TRPM7 (1:1000),
anti-p-Akt (1:1000), anti-Akt (1:1000), anti-p-ERK1/2
(1:1000), anti-ERK1/2 (1:1000), anti-MMP-2 (1:1000),
and anti-β-actin (1:1000). This was followed by incubation
for one hour at room temperature with the corresponding
HRP-labeled secondary antibody (1:8000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). The blots were developed
with a chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences Inc., Boston, MA, USA), and quantification via
densitometry was carried out using the ImageJ software.

Cell viability and proliferation assay
MTT assays were carried out as previously
described [4, 5]. In summary, U87 cells (5 × 104 cells/mL)
were cultured on 96-well plates and treated with naltriben
at varying concentrations (25, 50, 75, or 100 μM) for
24 h, with the equivalent DMSO (0.1%; vehicle) as the
control. Following treatment, MTT reagent (5 mg/ml MTT
in PBS) was added at a dilution of 1:10 into each well.
Cells were then incubated for three hours (37°C, 5% CO2).
During incubation, mitochondrial enzymes reduce MTT
(yellow) to form insoluble formazan (purple). Afterwards,
the medium was discarded and 100 μL DMSO was added
in each well to dissolve the formazan. Viability of cells
is measured by quantifying the amount of formazan
at an absorbance of 490 nm using a microplate reader
(Syngery H1, Biotek, USA). U87 viability was expressed
as a percentage of the 0.1% DMSO vehicle control. Three
independent experiments were carried out, and each repeat
consisted of eight (untreated cells) or six samples per
group (naltriben-treated cells).

Scratch wound assay

Statistical analysis

Cell migration was determined with scratch wound
assays as previously described [4, 5]. In summary, U87
cells (5×104 cells/mL) were cultured on 6-well plates, and
when the confluency became > 90%, a scratch wound was

To compare the difference between two groups, the
Student’s t-tests were used. For multiple comparisons, we
used one-way ANOVA with subsequent Newman-Keuls
