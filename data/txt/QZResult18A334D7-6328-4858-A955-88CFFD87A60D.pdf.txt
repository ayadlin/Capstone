Abstract
The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway represents an important class of emerging developmental signaling
pathways that play critical roles in the genesis of a large number of human cancers. The pharmaceutical industry
is currently focused on developing small molecules targeting Smoothened (Smo), a key signaling effector of the
HH pathway that regulates the levels and activity of the Gli family of transcription factors. Although one of these
compounds, vismodegib, is now FDA-approved for patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, acquired
mutations in Smo can result in rapid relapse. Furthermore, many cancers also exhibit a Smo-independent
activation of Gli proteins, an observation that may underlie the limited efﬁcacy of Smo inhibitors in clinical trials
against other types of cancer. Thus, there remains a critical need for HH inhibitors with different mechanisms of
action, particularly those that act downstream of Smo. Recently, we identiﬁed the FDA-approved anti-pinworm
compound pyrvinium as a novel, potent (IC50, 10 nmol/L) casein kinase-1a (CK1a) agonist. We show here that
pyrvinium is a potent inhibitor of HH signaling, which acts by reducing the stability of the Gli family of
transcription factors. Consistent with CK1a agonists acting on these most distal components of the HH signaling
pathway, pyrvinium is able to inhibit the activity of a clinically relevant, vismodegib -resistant Smo mutant, as well
as the Gli activity resulting from loss of the negative regulator suppressor of fused. We go on to demonstrate the
utility of this small molecule in vivo, against the HH-dependent cancer medulloblastoma, attenuating its growth
and reducing the expression of HH biomarkers. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4811–21. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway plays key instructional roles during embryonic development and adult tissue
homeostasis. Consistent with this pivotal instructional role,
the HH signaling pathway is commonly deregulated in many
human cancers (1). The role HH plays in cancer was ﬁrst
identiﬁed in the inherited disorder Gorlin syndrome, which
predisposes to basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma, and results from loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the HH core receptor component

Patched1 (Ptch1; ref. 2). Spontaneous cases of these tumors
were subsequently shown to result from mutations or ampliﬁcations of a number of HH signaling components, including
Ptch1. Strong support for the role that HH signaling plays in
these cancers was provided from a number of genetic mouse
models of HH-driven medulloblastoma, in which mutations in
HH signaling components lead to the genesis of the same
tumors (3, 4). The growth of the tumors in these mice could also
be abrogated by treatment with HH signaling inhibitors (5).
The pharmaceutical industry is currently focused on developing small molecules targeting Smoothened (Smo), a key signaling effector of the HH pathway that regulates the levels and
activity of the Gli family of transcription factors (2). Although
one of these compounds, vismodegib, is now FDA-approved for
patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (2), acquired
mutations in Smo can result in rapid relapse (6). Furthermore,
many cancers also exhibit a Smo-independent activation of Gli
proteins (7), an observation that may underlie the limited
efﬁcacy observed for Smo inhibitors in clinical trials against
other types of cancer (2). Thus, there remains a critical need for
HH inhibitors with different mechanisms of action, particularly
those that act downstream of Smo.
HH signaling is activated by binding of the HH ligands [Sonic
(SHH), Indian, or Desert] to a receptor consisting of a Ptch
protein (Ptch1 or Ptch2) and one of three coreceptors (8). This
results in derepression of the G-protein–coupled seven-transmembrane protein Smo. Ultimately, canonical HH signaling

regulates the activity, proteolytic processing, and stability of
members of the Gli family of transcription factors, Gli1-3 (7).
This regulation requires a number of protein kinases, including
protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and
casein kinase1a (9–12), and the negative regulator suppressor
of fused (Sufu; refs. 13, 14). Mammalian HH signaling requires
trafﬁcking through primary cilia, a membrane-encased microtubule-enriched organelle located on the apical side of polarized cells (8, 15). Many components of the HH signaling
pathway transit through the primary cilia in their basal state
and leave or enrich there in response to HH (8). During this
trafﬁcking through the specialized environment of the primary
cilia, Gli proteins, likely through their interaction with Sufu, are
converted into their repressor forms or in response to HH
converted into their active forms (16–18). In the basal state,
Gli2 and Gli3 are hyperphosphorylated at their Cul1-dependent
degrons (10, 11, 19). Subsequent to ubiquitination, Gli2 and
Gli3 are partially cleaved by proteasomes into their repressor
forms. In response to HH, Gli2 and Gli3 become differentially
phosphorylated by PKA, at a distinct amino-terminal domain,
converting them into their activated nuclear forms (19–21).
Nuclear-enriched Gli2 and Gli3 are labile and are quickly
degraded by the proteasome through a Cul3-mediated ubiquitin proteasome system (17, 22).
We recently reported that the FDA-approved drug pyrvinium is a novel and potent small molecule inhibitor of the Wnt
pathway (IC50, 10 nmol/L; ref. 23). We identiﬁed CK1a as the
critical cellular target of pyrvinium and showed that pyrvinium
acts as an allosteric activator of this protein kinase. Our in vitro
and cellular binding studies demonstrated that pyrvinium
binds avidly to CK1a (Kd, 1 nmol/L; ref. 23). Of the CK1 family
members (a, g, d, and e), only CK1a is activated by pyrvinium.
Pyrvinium has no effect on the activities of a panel of other
protein kinases representing all of the major branches of the
kinase superfamily (23), demonstrating that pyrvinium selectively binds to and activates CK1a. As CK1a is implicated as a
negative regulator of the HH signaling pathway, we hypothesized that pyrvinium might inhibit HH signaling (24). Here, we
show that pyrvinium does indeed attenuate HH signaling, and
does so in vitro and in vivo—attenuating the growth of a wellaccepted HH-driven mouse tumor model. Furthermore, pyrvinium acts to regulate Gli activity and stability downstream of
Smo, in a CK1a-dependent manner, including attenuating HH
activity driven by a clinically relevant, vismodegib-resistant
Smo mutation (6).

injection for the indicated times. For local peritumoral delivery, pyrvinium chloride was resuspended in PBS containing
10% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-cyclodextrin and injected close to the
tumor nodule every other day.

Results
We recently identiﬁed CK1a as the critical cellular target of
pyrvinium and showed that pyrvinium acts as a novel allosteric
activator of its protein kinase activity (23). As CK1a is also a key
regulator of HH signaling (24), we hypothesized that pyrvinium
would function as an inhibitor of this important developmental signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated
pyrvinium's ability to attenuate HH signaling. We stimulated
HH activity in a HH reporter cell line (Light-II cells), using
either SHH or the Smo agonist SAG, and in both cases

pyrvinium attenuated HH activity in a potent (IC50 of 10
nmol/L), dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Pyrvinium also
inhibited HH-dependent expression of Gli1 and Ptch1, two
well-established biomarkers of HH activity (Fig. 1B; ref. 1). In
contrast, the inactive structural analog of pyrvinium VU211
(23) was unable to attenuate the expression of these HH
biomarkers. We next evaluated the ability of pyrvinium to
inhibit the proliferation of HH-dependent primary GPC, another well-established readout of HH activity (25, 29). Primary GPC
were isolated and treated with SHH plus pyrvinium or the Smo
antagonist cyclopamine. Pyrvinium attenuated GPC proliferation, and did so in a manner similar to cyclopamine (Fig. 1C).
These data indicate that pyrvinium is a potent inhibitor of HH
signaling.
Pyrvinium has been reported to exhibit biologic effects via
mechanisms distinct from CK1a activation (30–33). Most

recently, it has been suggested that pyrvinium attenuates Wnt
activity by blocking activation of AKT, preventing GSK3b
phosphorylation and its subsequent inactivation, which results
in the phosphorylation and destabilization of b-catenin (34).
However, we show that the expression of a constitutive active
AKT construct did not abolish pyrvinium's suppression of HH
signaling (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Furthermore, we recently
determined pyrvinium's ability to bind to the active site of a
large panel of protein kinases (442 puriﬁed kinases) using
Ambit's scanMAX kinase proﬁling service (data not shown).
This screen examined the ability of pyrvinium to outcompete
kinases bound to a set of immobilized active site ligands. These
ligands bind to the active site of one or more kinases with high
afﬁnity (Kd <1 nmol/L). Different concentrations of pyrvinium
were used to outcompete the individual kinases from the
immobilized ligands. Our data suggest that pyrvinium does
not bind to the active site of CK1a, as pyrvinium did not
compete with CK1a binding to its immobilized ligand in this
assay. Consistent with this result, we did not observe the effects
of ATP on pyrvinium activity. We did, however, observe effects
of pyrvinium on the conformation of CK1a as detected by an
altered trypsin proteolysis pattern (23). Signiﬁcantly, the scanMAX kinase screen failed to detect inhibition of any of the
kinases tested (using 1 mmol/L of pyrvinium), which included
AKT1-3 isoforms and all known PI3-kinases. Furthermore,
consistent with pyrvinium acting through CK1a, we show that
the addition of pyrvinium to cells results in the time-dependent
phosphorylation of a known CK1a substrate (Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
To more directly show that pyrvinium's ability to inhibit HH
signaling is CK1a dependent, we identiﬁed two shRNAs capable of reducing CK1a protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Light-II cells infected with this lentivirus were treated with
SAG to stimulate HH activity, followed by pyrvinium treatment. CK1a knockdown reduced the capability of pyrvinium to
attenuate the expression of Gli1, relative to cells infected with
control shRNA lentivirus (Fig. 1D). We also observed that
knockdown of CK1a reduced the overall levels of SAG-induced
HH target gene expression, as might be expected, given the
positive role that CK1a also plays in Smo activation (35).
The HH and Wnt signaling pathways negatively regulate or
positively reinforce each other depending on cell context (36).
Thus, CK1a agonists could potentially attenuate HH signaling
indirectly via inhibition of Wnt signaling. To test this possibility, we asked whether the Wnt inhibitors IWR-1 or XAV939,
which mediate their activity via mechanisms distinct from
pyrvinium, similarly inhibit HH signaling. We found that IWR-1
and XAV939 did not suppress SAG-stimulated HH activation,
nor did they potentiate the capacity of pyrvinium to inhibit
HH signaling (Fig. 1E and data not shown). We then treated
Gli2/; Gli3/ immortalized mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts
(MEF), which are not capable of responding to HH (26), with
Wnt3a in the presence and absence of pyrvinium. Although
these MEFs did not respond to SAG, Wnt3a-induced signaling
was still observed. Furthermore, Wnt signaling remained
pyrvinium sensitive in the absence of any HH signaling (Fig.
1F). Thus, in these contexts, pyrvinium's ability to inhibit HH or
Wnt signaling is independent of each other.

Pyrvinium potently inhibits HH signaling stimulated by the
oncogenic Smo-M2 mutant (data not shown). Given the emergence of vismodegib resistance in the clinic (6), due to mutation of its binding site on Smo, we tested whether pyrvinium
could bypass a vismodegib-resistant Smo mutant (Smo-M2D473H; ref. 6) to inhibit HH signaling. Pyrvinium potently
inhibited HH signaling activated by Smo-M2-D473H; vismodegib had no observable effect (Fig. 2A). Thus, pyrvinium acts
to inhibit HH signaling via a mechanism distinct from vismodegib. We next determined the impact of pyrvinium treatment
on the localization of Smo to the primary cilia of cells, which is
an indication of Smo activation (35). Our results show that
although pyrvinium treatment did result in a slight increase in
Smo localization, in the absence of SAG treatment, this
increase was not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 2B). In addition,
pyrvinium treatment had no impact on the increased Smo
localization observed in response to activation by SAG, which
suggests that pyrvinium acts downstream of Smo. Consistent
with this hypothesis, pyrvinium was able to inhibit constitutive
HH pathway activity in MEFs lacking Sufu, a negative regulator
of HH signaling (14), whereas the Smo antagonist cyclopamine
was unable to inhibit this activity (Fig. 2C).
Ultimately, HH signaling is mediated by Gli transcription
factors, whose activity and stability are regulated by a number
of protein kinases, including CK1a (7). We, therefore, determined whether pyrvinium's ability to inhibit the expression of a
HH biomarker is Gli dependent. MEFs lacking Gli1, Gli2, or Gli3
were all capable of responding to SAG in a manner that was
attenuated by pyrvinium (Fig. 2D). Consistent with Gli2 and
Gli3 playing redundant roles as HH-stimulated transcription
factors, immortalized MEFs lacking both Gli2 and Gli3 did not
respond to SAG to promote HH pathway activation (26). A low
level of SAG-induced activity was observed in MEFs lacking
both Gli1 and Gli2, and this low-level activation was mediated
by the activator form of Gli3 (26). Pyrvinium did not attenuate
this low level of activity, suggesting that pyrvinium does not
regulate Gli3A-mediated transcriptional activity (Fig. 2D,
right). Pyrvinium attenuated constitutive HH activity in cells
overexpressing Gli1 (Fig. 2E) or Gli2 (data not shown), in
contrast with the Smo antagonist vismodegib. These results
suggest that pyrvinium is capable of attenuating the transcriptional activator function of Gli1 and Gli2, which are the major
drivers of HH activity in cancer.
As CK1a has been implicated in the proteolysis of the
Drosophila Gli homolog Ci (8), we tested the hypothesis that
pyrvinium attenuates Gli activity by regulating its stability. We
transfected the NIH-3T3 cells with a plasmid expressing Gli1
and treated them with increasing doses of pyrvinium. Immunoblotting of these cell lysates showed a dose-dependent
decrease in the levels of Gli1 relative to control (Fig. 3A). This
decrease in Gli1 protein levels occurred at doses of pyrvinium
as low as 10 nmol/L, and was not a general consequence of
inhibiting HH activity because two structurally distinct Smo
antagonists did not affect Gli1 protein levels (Fig. 3A, right).
Similar results were obtained with Gli2, although in this case,
pyrvinium-mediated destabilization was observed only when
HH signaling was activated (Fig. 3B). We also analyzed the
levels of Gli3 protein in 3T3 cells treated with or without

response to HH, both full-length Gli3 and Gli3-R levels were
reduced regardless of pyrvinium treatment (Fig. 3C). This

know why activation of CK1a by pyrvinium is insufﬁcient to
promote additional Gli3 processing, but speculate that the
basal levels of CK1a activity are sufﬁcient to promote maximum processing or that priming by PKA is the rate-limiting
event in Gli3 processing (19).
Consistent with pyrvinium acting through CK1a to regulate
Gli stability, CK1a overexpression also resulted in destabilization

tion by pyrvinium is consistent with the speciﬁcity of this
association. Medulloblastoma tissue harboring a constitutively
active HH signaling pathway coexpresses detectable levels of
endogenous Gli1 and CK1a (Fig. 4D and E). Using antibodies
speciﬁc to either of these proteins, we also observed an
association between endogenous CK1a and endogenous Gli1
from this tissue (Fig. 4E). The decreased stability of Glis that we
observed in response to pyrvinium, combined with the association between Gli proteins and CK1a, suggests that CK1a
may directly phosphorylate Glis to regulate their stability.
Consistent with this suggestion, puriﬁed CK1a is capable of
phosphorylating puriﬁed Gli1, and this phosphorylation is
further stimulated by pyrvinium (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
To demonstrate the capacity of pyrvinium to attenuate the
growth of HH activity–dependent cancers, we focused on a
well-established mouse model of HH-dependent medulloblastoma that is routinely used to determine the efﬁcacy of HH
inhibitors, the Ptchþ/ medulloblastoma model (2). We dissected a spontaneous medulloblastoma from a Ptchþ/ mouse,
and serially passaged the tumor as an allograft in CD-1 nude
mice. We validated the dependency of HH signaling for these
tumors as HH (Gli1, Ptch2) but not Wnt (Axin2, Dkk1, and Lgr5)
biomarkers were aberrantly activated (Fig. 5A). Acute treatment of pyrvinium in this mouse model attenuated the expression of the HH biomarkers Gli1 and Ptch2 (Fig. 5B). Chronic
treatment of such mice, using animals subcutaneously injected
with pyrvinium adjacent to the approximately 100-mm3
tumors, dramatically reduced the growth of medulloblastoma
allografts (Fig. 5C). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
demonstrated that tumors from pyrvinium-treated animals
showed decreased cancer cells and increased ﬁbrotic tissue,

of the exogenous Gli1 protein (Supplementary Fig. S3A, left). In
contrast, knockdown of CK1a attenuated pyrvinium's ability to
degrade Gli1 (Fig. 3D), whereas treatment with a CK1 antagonist (Supplementary Fig. S3A, right) increased Gli protein
levels. To test the hypothesis that decreased stability of Glis
results from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal and lysosomalmediated degradation pathways, targeted via a CK1a-containing protein complex, we applied pharmacologic inhibitors to
block speciﬁc protein degradation pathways and determined
their effect on pyrvinium-mediated Gli destabilization. The
proteasomal inhibitor MG-132, but not the lysosomal inhibitor
Baﬁlomycin A1, blocks pyrvinium-induced Gli1 destabilization
(Supplementary Fig. S3B), suggesting that pyrvinium regulates
Gli levels via proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent
with this, pyrvinium greatly increased the level of Gli1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3E) and decreased the half-life of Gli1 protein in
cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(Fig. 3F and Supplementary Fig. S3C).
We hypothesized that CK1a might regulate Gli stability
through direct association, in a manner analogous to the
association described between the Drosophila Gli homolog Ci
and CK1a (8). To test this possibility, we lysed HEK 293T cells
expressing Flag-tagged Gli1, Myc-tagged Gli2, or a control
plasmid, immunoprecipitated either Gli1 or Gli2, and then
immunoblotted for associated CK1a. Endogenous CK1a associated with both Gli1 (Fig. 4A) and Gli2 (Fig. 4B), but was not
observed in the control immunoprecipitates. The association
between Gli1 and CK1a can be reduced following acute
treatment with pyrvinium (Fig. 4C), and this decreased association temporally preceded any observed Gli destabilization
(data not shown). The reversibility of the Gli1/CK1a associa-

compared with that from the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 5D),
consistent with a reduction in the size of the tumor driven by
decreased numbers of tumor cells. In the pyrvinium-treated
tumors, the expression of HH target genes was decreased
relative to the vehicle control group (Fig. 5E). However, Wnt
target genes, which are not hyperactivated in this subtype of
medulloblastoma (see Fig. 5A), were not different between
pyrvinium and vehicle-treated tissue (Fig. 5E). These observations are inconsistent with a generalized, nonspeciﬁc effect on

tumor cells, in which a reduction in total gene expression
might be expected. Thus, the CK1a agonist pyrvinium attenuates HH pathway activity and tumor growth in vivo in a wellestablished model of HH-driven medulloblastoma.

Discussion
We show here that the FDA-approved anthelmintic drug
pyrvinium can be repurposed as a potent HH inhibitor.

Casein Kinase 1a Agonists Attenuate HH Signaling

Consistent with pyrvinium acting as a CK1a agonist (23), we
show that it attenuates HH signaling in a CK1a-dependent
manner. We further show that CK1a and Gli proteins associate
and propose a model by which pyrvinium induces Gli destabilization downstream of Smo. Unlike vismodegib, the only
Smo inhibitor currently FDA approved (2), pyrvinium is able to
attenuate increased Gli activity resulting from loss of Sufu,
overexpression of a Gli protein, or a Smo protein harboring a
clinically relevant vismodegib-resistant mutation. Pyrvinium
was also able to attenuate the growth of a well-established HHdriven cancer model, a Ptchþ/-driven medulloblastoma allograft mouse model (5, 37). Interestingly, a signiﬁcant number of
human medulloblastomas result from loss of Sufu or ampliﬁcation of Gli2 (1), and thus would be resistant to vismodegib
but might conceivably respond to a CK1a agonist such as
pyrvinium. In its current method of dosing and formulation,
pyrvinium likely lacks the pharmacokinetic properties to be
used in the clinic against HH-driven tumors. However,
improvements in its formulation or delivery, such as perhaps
direct ventricular delivery into the brain, might rapidly be
adapted to treat such patients with late-stage cancer for whom
few therapeutic options remain.
Importantly, given the emergence of noncanonical Gli activation in human cancers (1), pyrvinium's effects on HH signaling occurred downstream of Smo, where it induces the
destabilization of Gli proteins. A number of other Gli inhibitors
have now been described (2). For example, although Gli
antagonists (GANT) are now widely used Gli inhibitors in the
laboratory setting, their IC50s are more than 100-times higher
than the CK1a agonists described here. Similar potency concerns also exist for another class of HH inhibitor HPI (IC50, 10
mmol/L), which perturb Gli processing and stability. Arsenic
trioxide is another FDA-approved drug that has been repurposed as a Gli inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. Although this drug is
already clinically available, its limited potency and welldescribed dose-limiting toxicities in humans, which occur at
doses similar to those required to inhibit HH signaling, may
limit its usefulness in the clinic.
Although CK1 was initially thought to be constitutively
active, recent evidence suggests that individual members of
this protein kinase family are regulated via an array of transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms (38). For CK1a,
such mechanisms include the frequent silencing of CK1a in
melanoma and loss-of-heterozygosity of the CK1a gene in approximately 30% of all human tumors (http://www.sanger.ac.
uk/cgi-bin/genetics/CGP/cghviewer/CghHome.cgi)—consistent with CK1a activity being growth suppressing in many
human cancers (39, 40). The identiﬁcation of pyrvinium as an
allosteric activator of CK1a led to the speculation that pyrvinium may be mimicking an endogenous regulator of CK1a.
This was conﬁrmed with the recent identiﬁcation of a novel
family of proteins that regulate the activity of CK1 kinases
in vivo, and the demonstration that CK1a activity can be
attenuated by extracellular ligands, such as Wnts (41, 42).
These newly identiﬁed levels of regulation could potentially
be usurped for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics that target individual CK1 isoforms. The excitement of a
class of anticancer agents such as pyrvinium comes from the

www.aacrjournals.org

recognition that drugs that act via allosteric mechanisms are
not constrained by active site chemistry and are much more
selective (sites may not be conserved even between proteins in
the same family) in their mechanism of action.
CK1a participates in a number of cellular processes other
than HH and Wnt signaling, including retinoid X receptor
regulation (43). Interestingly, similar to its role in HH signaling,
CK1a plays a dual function in NF-kB signaling, both promoting
and repressing receptor-induced NF-kB activity (44). However,
this is unlikely to be an impediment for its further development
as a target for treating cancer. In fact, inhibitors that target
other distinct CK1 isoforms (d and e) are currently in preclinical development in both academia and industry, to treat a
variety of human pathologies (45, 46). In addition, there is
signiﬁcant precedence for the development of very effective
anticancer agents that target proteins involved in basic cellular
processes, which takes advantage of a tumor's increased
sensitivity to such agents. Many of these have already been
approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials. These include
paclitaxel (microtubule stabilizer), vorinostat (HDAC inhibitor), velcade (proteasome inhibitor), temsirolimus (mTOR
inhibitor), and geldanamycin derivatives (targets HSP90 and
currently in phase II clinical trials).
