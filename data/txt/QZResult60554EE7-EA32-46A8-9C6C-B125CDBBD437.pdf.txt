Abstract
MMSET (WHSC1/NSD2) is a SET domain–containing histone lysine methyltransferase the expression of
which is deregulated in a subgroup of multiple myelomas with the t(4;14)(p16;q32) translocation associated with
poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown that MMSET mRNA levels are increased in other tumor types as well.
We have carried out immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays and found that MMSET protein is
frequently and highly expressed in neuroblastoma (MMSET positive in 75% of neuroblastomas, n ¼ 164). The
expression level of MMSET in neuroblastomas was significantly associated with poor survival, negative
prognostic factors, and metastatic disease. Moreover, a subset of neuroblastomas for which pre- and postchemotherapy biopsies were available displayed a strong decrease in MMSET protein levels after chemotherapy.
In agreement with neuroblastomas becoming more differentiated after treatment, we show that retinoic acid–
induced differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells in vitro also leads to a strong decrease in MMSET levels.
Furthermore, we show that the high levels of MMSET in normal neural progenitor cells are strongly downregulated during differentiation. Importantly, we show that MMSET is required for proliferation of neuroblastoma cells and brain-derived neural stem cells. Taken together, our results suggest that MMSET is
implicated in neuroblastomagenesis possibly by supporting proliferation of progenitor cells and negatively
regulating their differentiation. In this respect, MMSET might be a strong candidate therapeutic target in a
subset of neuroblastomas with unfavorable prognosis. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4226–35. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastic tumors are embryonal neural sympathetic
system tumors, which arise in the adrenal gland or the sympathetic chain (1). These tumors derive from cells that migrate
from the neural crest and give rise to the sympathetic nervous
system. They display a broad range of differentiation spanning
from more mature and benign (ganglioneuromas) to inter-

mediate and potentially malignant (ganglioneuroblastomas) to
undifferentiated and always malignant (neuroblastomas)
forms. On the basis of the relative proportion of cytodifferentiated ganglion cells, neuroblasts, and Schwann cells, the
neuroblastic tumors have been classified as stroma-rich
tumors, including ganglioneuromas and intermixed ganglioneuroblastomas, and stroma-poor tumors also known as neuroblastomas (2, 3). The majority of neuroblastomas and
ganglioneuroblastomas occur in the first 5 years of life, whereas
most ganglioneuromas affect patients that are older than 10
years (1). Rare neuroblastomas and ganglioneuroblastomas
occurring in adolescents and adults are characterized by longer
clinical course, but the final outcome of these tumors is poor
regardless of age (4). Neuroblastoma represents the most
common extracranial solid malignancy of childhood and is
usually sporadic, but familial cases associated with germ line
gene mutations, particularly in the ALK gene, have been
identified (5, 6). In addition, many different genetic aberrations
have been identified in neuroblastoma including the most
frequent 17q gain, 1p36 loss, and N-MYC amplification (7).
The prognosis of high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor
despite intensive chemotherapy. It is therefore of great importance to obtain a more detailed molecular understanding of the
disease and to suggest potentially better prognostic markers.

MMSET Expression in Neuroblastoma

The MMSET/WHSC1/NSD2 gene located at chromosome
4p16.3 encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase (8, 9). It
undergoes alternative splicing resulting in different protein
isoforms including MMSET type I, MMSET type II, and REIIBP (Supplementary Fig. S1A; refs. 10, 11). Northern blotting
studies have revealed that MMSET mRNA is highly expressed
in embryonic tissues, especially those with high degrees of
proliferation, whereas in adult tissues, MMSET mRNA is
primarily expressed in thymus and testis (10, 12, 13). MMSET
is involved in the reciprocal t(4;14)(p16;q32) translocation in
multiple myeloma that is detected in approximately 15% to
20% of cases (14–17) and is associated with poor prognosis (14,
16, 17). Recently, it was shown that MMSET is essential for
growth of myeloma cell lines, suggesting a role of MMSET in
proliferation of the malignant plasma cells (18–20). Upregulation of MMSET protein was found in glioblastoma versus
normal brain cortex by proteomic profiling (21). Other studies
have also described high levels of MMSET mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (22) and leukemia (12), whereas a search in
the Oncomine Cancer Microarray Database revealed
increased mRNA in different cancer types (23). For several
of these cancers, high MMSET mRNA levels appeared to be
associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (23).
To investigate MMSET protein expression in human
tumors, we have generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb)
that specifically reacts with MMSET in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Through tissue microarray
(TMA)-based screening for MMSET expression in more than
3,000 different tumor samples, we have found that MMSET is
highly expressed in many human tumors (24). In this study, we
show that MMSET is highly expressed in aggressive neuroblastomas, is required for proliferation of neuroblastoma cells
in tissue culture, and is involved in differentiation of neural
progenitor cells (NPC).

Materials and Methods
Production of mAbs against MMSET
The MMSET fragment antigens Ag1 and Ag2 (corresponding
to amino acids 1–119 and 939–985 of human MMSET type II,
respectively) and the corresponding MMSET mAbs, 9A6 and
8C3, are schematically represented in Supplementary Fig. S1A.
The development and characterization of 9A6 mAb has been
described (24). The 9A6 mAb was effectively used for immunohistochemistry and both 8C3 and 9A6 mAbs were used for
immunoblotting. The 8C3 mAb, but not the 9A6 mAb, recognizes mouse Mmset type II as well as human MMSET type II.
Tissue culture and differentiation protocols
All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 C
with 5% CO2. U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and
100 mg/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco). Myeloma
cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) with
10% FBS (Hyclone) and 100 mg/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco). SH-SY5Y cells were grown on collagen-coated
plates (BD Biosciences) in minimum essential medium
(Gibco) with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 100 mg/mL penicillin

www.aacrjournals.org

and streptomycin (Gibco). For SH-SY5Y differentiation, 106
cells were seeded on a 10-cm plate; 10 mmol/L retinoic acid
(RA; Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 4 days and subsequently, 50
ng/mL brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Invitrogen)
for an additional 4 days in the absence of serum as described
(25). SK-N-BE2 cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium
(Gibco) with 15% FBS (Hyclone) and 100 mg/mL penicillin
and streptomycin (Gibco).
Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were differentiated into
NPC with characteristics of radial glial cells and then further
into neurons for 5 days as described (26).
Brain-derived neural stem cells (bNSC) were isolated from
E12.5 mouse embryos and propagated as described in Supplementary Information. The bNSCs were differentiated by
removing epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF) from the medium and adding 1% FBS
(Hyclone). The pCAG MMSET overexpression construct was
electroporated into bNSCs using the Nucleofector (Amaxa)
and the Mouse Neural stem Cell Kit (Amaxa).
Colony assays
For colony assays, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-BE2, or bNSC cells were
infected with MMSET pLKO knockdown constructs, incubated for 2 days, and selected in puromycin for 3 days.
Subsequently, 2  105 SH-SY5Y cells per well, 2  103 SKN-BE2 cells per well, and 2  103 bNSC cells per well were
seeded in a 6-well dish in triplicates. Colonies were stained
with crystal violet.
TMA and staining with MMSET antibody
The initial neuroblastoma cohort (cohort 1, n ¼ 44) was
analyzed as a part of a large screening for MMSET expression
carried out on TMA containing 3,818 FFPE representative
archival samples (diameter, 0.6 mm) from many different
human tumor types and 904 corresponding controls from
normal tissues (24, 27). These samples (provided by R. Simon
and G. Sauter) were derived from tissues previously collected for
routine diagnostic procedures carried out at the Department of
Pathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf
(Germany) in accordance with the principles of the "EthikKommission der Ärztekammer, Hamburg." Verification of
results from cohort 1 was carried out on other TMAs containing
a new cohort of FFPE, 1-mm large samples (cohort 2, n ¼ 189)
from neuroblastic tumors collected in Italy (n ¼ 67, diagnosed
between 1992 and 2004, provided by R. Rota and M.A. De Ioris)
and Denmark (n ¼ 94, as previously described in ref. 1 and 28
additional tumors diagnosed between 2002 and 2010, provided
by B.L. Petersen and E. Santoni-Rugiu). The 189 neuroblastic
tumors included 143 biopsies from primary tumors, 26 biopsies
from metastatic tumors, and 20 biopsies taken after chemotherapy. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
and Ethics Committee. Collection and TMA-based screenings
of tumor samples were in accordance with the ethical principles
for medical research issued by the World Medical Association's
Declaration of Helsinki. The screenings were not used to modify
the original diagnosis or patients’ treatment.
The 143 primary neuroblastic tumors in cohort 2 comprised
ganglioneuromas (n ¼ 13), ganglioneuroblastomas (n ¼ 10),

and neuroblastomas (n ¼ 120). Corresponding clinicopathologic data and long-term follow-up were available for the
patients in cohort 2 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
MMSET immunostaining was carried out on deparaffinized,
4-mm thick TMA sections by initially retrieving antigens in TrisEGTA (TEG; pH ¼ 9) buffer in a microwave oven (600 Watt/18
min), cooling down the slides for 20 minutes in dH20, and
thereafter blocking endogenous peroxidase activity according
to the protocol of EnVision mouse kit (Dako). The TMA samples
were incubated with purified 9A6 mAb (0.5 mg/mL, diluted 1:100)
in 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin)/TBS buffer at 4 C overnight.
As secondary antibody, EnVision mouse kit (Dako) was used.
Immune reaction was revealed by 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB;
Dako) and CuSO4 to enhance the signal. As reference staining,
germinal centers from hyperplastic lymph nodes were used
(corresponding to MMSET score 2). Omission and substitution
of 9A6 mAb with unspecific Ig was utilized as negative control.
The MMSET immunostainings were analyzed by 2 pathologists
(E. Santoni-Rugiu and B.L. Petersen) blind to clinicopathologic
data and were scored as follows:
0 (negative): no nuclear staining
1 (weak): <10% positive cells (and weak nuclear staining
intensity)
2 (moderate): between 10% and 50% positive cells (and
moderate nuclear staining intensity)
3 (strong): >50% positive cells (and strong nuclear staining
intensity)
The terms in parentheses indicate that, in the vast majority of
the samples, a correlation was observed between amount of
positive cells and intensity of the nuclear staining. A minimum
of 100 relevant cells were counted. Uninformative TMA samples (fallen off during processing; poor quality due to artifact;
not representative; fewer than 100 tumor cells in the sample)
were excluded from the scores.
Statistics
All statistical analyses were carried out using Fisher's exact
test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Kaplan–Meier log-rank test,
and Cox regression analyses. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Additional methods are available online, including plasmid
constructs, primer sequences for quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR), antibodies used for immunoblotting, and additional tissue culture information.

Results
MMSET is highly expressed in a subset of
neuroblastomas
To determine the expression levels of MMSET in primary
human tumors, 2 mAbs to MMSET, 9A6 and 8C3, recognizing
different epitopes of the protein were generated (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The 9A6 mAb recognizes MMSET type I and II
and the characterization of this antibody has been described
(24). The 8C3 mAb recognizes MMSET type II and RE-IIBP and
the specificity of 8C3 was shown by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S1B). No expression of endogenous RE-IIBP was

4228

observed in U2OS cells, whereas a band presumably corresponding to RE-IIBP (but not confirmed by knockdown) was
detected in several myeloma cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S1C).
The 9A6 mAb specifically detects MMSET in FFPE tissues
and was used to determine MMSET protein expression levels
in TMAs containing 3,818 biopsies from different types of
human tumors and 904 samples from corresponding normal
tissues (24). Among the different tumors, MMSET was highly
expressed in adrenal neuroblastomas (cohort 1; n ¼ 44; 68%
positive) in contrast to an undetectable expression in normal
adrenal gland (n ¼ 12; P ¼ 2.6  104). To validate these data
from cohort 1, we tested a new cohort of samples representing
the whole differentiation spectrum of neuroblastic tumors
(cohort 2, n ¼ 189). Given the relative rarity of these tumors,
cohort 2 was represented by material collected from Danish
and Italian patients, for whom corresponding clinicopathologic data (Supplementary Fig. S2) and long-term follow-up after
diagnosis were available. This allowed clinical correlations
with MMSET protein expression.
Cohort 2 included 143 primary biopsies from neuroblastic
tumors of which 13 were ganglioneuromas, 10 ganglioneuroblastomas, and 120 neuroblastomas. In Fig. 1A, representative
examples of immunostainings are shown with the MMSET
score indicated. In Fig. 1B, the distribution among negative,
weak, moderate, and strong MMSET expression for the ganglioneuromas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and neuroblastomas is
shown. In the benign ganglioneuromas, no MMSET expression
was detected (0 of 13, 0%), whereas 3 of 10 (30%) ganglioneuroblastoma samples had a detectable level of MMSET.
In contrast, MMSET expression was observed in 93 of 120
(78%) neuroblastoma samples, the majority of which showed a
MMSET score of 2 and 3. The difference in MMSET expression
between neuroblastoma and the other tumor groups in cohort
2 was significant (Fig. 1B; Fisher's exact test, ganglioneuroma
vs. neuroblastoma, P < 0.0001; ganglioneuroblastoma vs. neuroblastoma, P ¼ 7.8  103). Taken together, these data
suggest that MMSET expression in neuroblastic tumors correlates inversely with their degree of differentiation and
directly with their malignant potential.
Correlation of MMSET expression with clinical data
The MMSET expression pattern of primary neuroblastomas in cohort 2 was comparable with that observed in
cohort 1, although with slight differences in the distribution
into weak, moderate, and strong staining (Fig. 2A). However,
overall, the 2 cohorts contained almost the same amount of
MMSET-positive samples (68% vs. 78%). By combining the 2
cohorts into 1 pool, we obtained the most precise assessment of MMSET expression in neuroblastomas: 123 of 164
(75%) tumors were positive for MMSET expression and of
these, 45 of 164 (27%) expressed MMSET at very high levels
(score 3). We next correlated MMSET expression in primary
neuroblastomas of cohort 2 with their corresponding clinicopathologic data. The patients with neuroblastomas displaying the highest MMSET expression levels (score 3) had
significantly poorer survival than those with neuroblastomas
showing lower or no expression (Fig. 2B; log-rank test,

P ¼ 0.012). Because no significant difference was observed in
survival between patients with neuroblastoma with MMSET
score 0, 1, and 2, these neuroblastomas were pooled in the
following correlations to clinicopathologic data. The Shimada system is a standardized age-linked classification
system for neuroblastomas dependent on the differentiation
grade of the neuroblasts, their cellular turnover index, and
the presence or absence of Schwannian stromal development. The tumors are assigned either a favorable or an
unfavorable Shimada histology, based on these parameters
(2, 3). A statistically significant difference in MMSET expression in neuroblastomas that were assigned a favorable
versus an unfavorable Shimada histology was observed, in
that neuroblastomas with unfavorable Shimada score displayed higher MMSET expression (Table 1; Fisher's exact
test, P < 0.0001). N-MYC amplification is present in approximately 30% of neuroblastoma cases, and this well-recognized genetic change is associated with advanced tumor
stage and poor prognosis (28). Higher frequency and intensity of MMSET expression was observed in neuroblastomas
with N-MYC amplification (Table 1; Fisher's exact test, P ¼
0.008). Furthermore, MMSET expression was lower in neuroblastomas from infants (<1 year of age) in comparison to
neuroblastomas from older patients (>1 year of age; Table 1;
Fisher's exact test, P ¼ 0.0051). These data correlated with
the fact that infants with neuroblastoma have a better
prognosis than older patients (3). Interestingly, we also
observed a significant inverse correlation between the

degree of differentiation of the neuroblastomas and MMSET
expression (Table 1; Fisher's exact test, P ¼ 0.0033). This
finding further supports a potential role of MMSET in
differentiation. In conclusion, MMSET expression appears
to correlate with well-known negative prognostic factors for
neuroblastoma. Other clinical parameters, such as sex and
tumor stage, were also correlated with MMSET expression.
We observed numerical differences favoring a positive correlation of high MMSET expression with male patients and
high stage, respectively, but they did not reach significance
(Table 1; Fisher's exact test, P ¼ 0.084 and P ¼ 0.056). We
also investigated whether MMSET expression was an independent prognostic factor in neuroblastoma, but that was
not the case for our relatively small cohort in contrast to
known independent prognostic factors such as age, stage,
and N-MYC amplification (Supplementary Fig. S3).
In addition to biopsies from primary tumors, the TMAs from
cohort 2 also included biopsies from metastases of neuroblastomas to solid organs (n ¼ 12) and to bone marrow (n ¼ 14).
Both types of metastases, and particularly bone marrow metastases (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.0001), showed more frequent and
stronger MMSET expression than primary tumors (Fig. 2C). The
corresponding patient-matched biopsies from primary tumors
were not available in most cases (either because neuroblastoma
diagnosis was made on metastatic lesions or simply because
it had not been possible to collect samples from primary
tumors for the TMA). Nevertheless, the significant difference
between MMSET expression in primary tumors and metastatic

MMSET expression is decreased following
chemotherapy
For 20 neuroblastic tumors in cohort 2, biopsies taken after
chemotherapy were available in addition to the primary
biopsies taken at the time of diagnosis. These postchemotherapy biopsies contained representative vital tumor tissue,
which was mostly characterized by a more differentiated
phenotype than the one detectable in prechemotherapy
biopsies (i.e., from prechemotherapy undifferentiated neuroblastoma to postchemotherapy poorly differentiated or differentiating neuroblastoma and from prechemotherapy
neuroblastoma to postchemotherapy ganglioneuroblastoma),
consistent with the often described maturation of neuroblastic tumors after chemotherapy (29). Interestingly, we observed
a decrease in MMSET expression after treatment in 11 of 13
cases (85%) and in 6 of these cases, a cytologic differentiation
was observed. In the remaining 2 cases and in the 7 MMSETnegative prechemotherapy cases, the MMSET expression
levels remained unchanged after treatment. Representative
examples of MMSET staining before and after chemotherapy
are shown in Fig. 3A. The overall distribution of MMSET
expression in the 20 neuroblastic tumors before and after
chemotherapy is shown in Fig. 3B (Wilcoxon signed rank test,
matched samples, P ¼ 3.5  103). The decrease in MMSET
expression after treatment paralleled in this way the induction
of more differentiated tumor histology, an important observation with respect to the potential involvement of MMSET in
differentiation of neuroblastic cells. These findings led us to
consider the possibility that MMSET may negatively regulate
differentiation of neuroblastic cells. To address this question,
we investigated whether MMSET has a role in the regulation of
differentiation of NPCs.
MMSET is involved in differentiation of NPCs
First, we investigated whether MMSET expression changes
during various stages of neural differentiation. For this purpose, we used the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line
induced to differentiate by the addition of RA and BDNF. We
monitored differentiation at days 0, 4, and 8 by assessing
increasing neurite outgrowth (Supplementary Fig. S4), and by
measuring the expression of the neuronal markers b-III-tubulin (30) and GAP43 (ref. 31; Fig. 4A, left). Concomitantly, we
tested MMSET protein expression levels by immunoblotting
and found that MMSET type II was drastically downregulated
during differentiation, whereas the level of MMSET type I
remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 4A, left). RE-IIBP protein
was not detectable in SH-SY5Y cells (not shown). The downregulation of MMSET protein expression was not matched by a
parallel decrease of MMSET type II mRNA levels (Fig. 4A, right).
This indicates that the decrease of MMSET type II protein
during differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells was due to a mechanism
involving posttranscriptional regulation. MMSET type I and
RE-IIBP mRNA levels did not significantly change either
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). To investigate the type of posttranscriptional regulation, SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated with

was blocked by MG-132, MMSET type II protein is most likely
targeted for proteolysis during differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

To understand whether MMSET levels are also decreased
on differentiation of nontumorigenic cells, we determined the
expression level of mouse Mmset type II, along with several
differentiation markers, during in vitro differentiation of
mouse ES cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, the expression level of
mouse Mmset type II increased when mouse ES cells were
differentiated into NPCs (day 0) and then decreased again
when these cells were further differentiated into neurons (days
3–5). In accordance with a previous study (8), Mmset type II
was also detectable in ES cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The
increase in expression levels of mouse Mmset type II correlated with an increase in mRNA levels, when ES cells were
differentiation into NPC (Fig. 4B, right). However, the drastic
decrease in MMSET protein levels on differentiation of NPC
into neurons was not paralleled by a similar reduction of
Mmset type II mRNA (Fig. 4B, right). No detectable changes in
Mmset type I mRNA levels were observed either (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Taken together, these results show that MMSET
type II levels are dramatically reduced in differentiated neurons as compared with NPC, and that this decrease is due to
posttranscriptional regulation of MMSET.
Given the high expression of MMSET in aggressive neuroblastomas, and the downregulation of MMSET during
differentiation of a neuroblastoma cell line and NPC in vitro,
we tested whether changing MMSET protein levels could
affect proliferation and/or differentiation. Knockdown of
MMSET type II in either SH-SY5Y or bNSCs led to a drastic
inhibition in cell proliferation, as assessed by colony assays
(Fig. 5A and B). The same inhibitory effect was also observed
by knocking down MMSET type II in another neuroblastoma
cell line, SK-N-BE2 that carries amplified N-MYC (Supplementary Fig. S7). In the converse experiment, ectopically
expressed MMSET type II in bNSCs did not lead to an
increase in proliferation; however, the differentiation of

Figure 4. The expression of MMSET is affected by differentiation in NPCs. A, the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was differentiated for 8 days. The
expression levels of MMSET type I and II proteins were measured at days 0, 4, and 8 by immunoblotting with the 9A6 mAb (left). Expression levels of
differentiation markers, b-III-tubulin and GAP43, were also determined by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting with b-tubulin was included as loading control.
Corresponding MMSET type II mRNA levels at days 0, 4, and 8 were monitored by qRT-PCR by a primer set exclusively detecting MMSET type II and
normalized to b-actin mRNA (right). B, mouse ES cells were differentiated into NPC and then further into neurons for 5 days. The expression level of mouse
MMSET type II protein was measured at ES stage, NPC stage (day 0), and then at differentiation day 1 to 5 by immunoblotting using the 8C3 mAb (left). In
addition, immunoblotting for several differentiation markers (Oct4, an ES marker; Pax6, an NPC marker; Nestin, an NPC marker; and b-III-tubulin, a neuronal
differentiation marker) was also performed (left). Immunoblotting with b-actin was included as loading control (left). The corresponding MMSET type II mRNA
levels at the same time points were monitored by qRT-PCR and normalized to b-actin mRNA (right).

the cells were slightly delayed compared with control cells as
measured by a higher expression of the stem cell–specific
filament protein, Nestin (Fig. 5C, left; Supplementary
Fig. S8). Interestingly, we were not able to maintain the
overexpression of MMSET type II in the bNSCs, although
high levels of the MMSET mRNA were present (Fig. 5C,
right). Similarly to ectopically expressed MMSET, the endogenous mouse Mmset mRNA level did not change during
differentiation of bNSCs (Supplementary Fig. S9A). These
findings further support the notion that MMSET levels are
regulated at the posttranscriptional level during differentiation. In support of this, we observed that the proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 blocks the downregulation of Mmset type
II in differentiating bNSCs (Supplementary Fig. S9B). Thus, it
is likely that MMSET type II protein is targeted for proteolysis during differentiation of NPCs.

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that MMSET is highly expressed
in neuroblastomas and is associated with aggressiveness.

Cancer Res; 71(12) June 15, 2011

A relatively high level of MMSET was observed in human
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in mouse NPC, and this
level decreased dramatically during differentiation presumably
due to posttranscriptional regulation by proteolysis. Importantly, we have also shown that MMSET is required for proliferation of the neuroblastoma cell lines and bNSCs in tissue
culture.
Although we have shown that MMSET is highly expressed in
75% of neuroblastomas in 2 independent cohorts; is associated
with poor prognostic markers, poor survival, and progression;
and is required for proliferation of neuroblastoma cells,
MMSET expression does not qualify in the current study as
an independent prognostic marker for poor survival of neuroblastoma patients. Additional studies including larger
cohorts might qualify MMSET as an independent marker,
providing extra prognostic significance to the currently used
markers. Importantly, however, our results further qualify
MMSET as a potential strong therapeutic target for the
development of anticancer drugs. These results are also
supported by searching the publicly available neuroblastoma
microarray database on the Oncogenomics website

(http://pob.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/cgi-bin/JK), where we found that
high MMSET mRNA expression correlated with poor survival.
We have shown that MMSET is required for the proliferation of bNSCs and tumor cells in tissue culture; however, so
far, it is not clear whether MMSET contributes to neuroblastoma tumor development or whether it is a marker of a
cancer stem cell population in the neuroblastomas. To
address the latter, we determined the expression levels of
MMSET in neural crest–derived cells, which are believed to
be the cells of origin for neuroblastoma. Thus, we immunostained human fetal tissue containing neural plate–
derived structures (neural tube and neural crest) made of
primitive neuroblasts (gestational age of 9 weeks). Interestingly, we found that both neural tube and neural crest cells
expressed high levels of MMSET. In contrast, at the gestational age of 13 weeks, MMSET expression was no longer
detected in the neural crest–derived neuroblasts present in
the developing adrenal gland. This finding is in agreement
with the observation that these cells are already committed
for differentiation and therefore have lost the phenotype of
neural crest (Supplementary Fig. S10). These results indicate
that the high expression of MMSET observed in neuroblastoma reflect a differentiation block of the cell of origin of
neuroblastomas. Two other lines of evidence support this

notion: First, RNA in situ hybridization on mouse embryonic
sections at embryonic days 10.5 and 13.5 showed high
expression of Mmset in neural tubes (13). Second, MMSET
expression is high in 26% (n ¼ 53) of teratomas, all represented by immature teratomas, in which MMSET was
expressed mostly in primitive blastema-like tissue or neuroectoderm-derived primitive neuroepithelial cells (ref. 24
and Supplementary Fig. S10C). Taken together our results
show that MMSET is expressed at high levels in the stem cell
population, and the high expression observed in neuroblastomas (and other types of tumors) therefore might reflect a
stem cell–like expression pattern in the cancer cells.
To address whether MMSET also could contribute to the
development of neuroblastomas (i.e., be a driver of tumorigenesis), we ectopically expressed MMSET type II in bNSCs
that subsequently was induced to undergo differentiation.
However, as for the endogenous protein and as observed in
treated tumors, differentiation signals led to a strong reduction in the ectopically expressed MMSET protein. This result
could indicate that additional genetic changes are required for
maintaining MMSET expression, and although a delay in
differentiation was observed, that high levels of MMSET are
not sufficient to induce a differentiation block of the neural
stem cells.

The roles of the different isoforms of MMSET in normal and
cancer cells are unclear. Because we do not have antibodies
available that can distinguish between the various isoforms, it
remains to be determined whether they are all highly
expressed in neuroblastoma. Importantly, however, the fulllength catalytically active MMSET type II has been shown to
possess oncogenic potential (18), and although some myeloma
cases have been found with only MMSET type I mRNA
upregulated (32), most results suggest that MMSET type II
is the driving oncogene.
In summary, we have found that high levels of MMSET
expression are present in aggressive neuroblastomas with
poor prognosis, that MMSET levels are high in the stem cell
population, and that MMSET is required for proliferation of
bNSC as well as neuroblastoma cells in culture. On the basis of
these findings, we propose that MMSET is a potential marker
for poor prognosis in neuroblastomas and a good candidate
for the development of anticancer drugs.
