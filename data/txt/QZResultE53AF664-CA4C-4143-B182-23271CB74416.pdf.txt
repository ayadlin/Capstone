Ovarian Cancer Metastasis

Abstract
Ovarian cancer is mainly confined in peritoneal cavity and its metastasis is often associated with the
formation of malignant ascites. As lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is present at high levels in ascites of ovarian
cancer patients and potently stimulates cell migration, we reason that LPA-stimulated cell migration may play
an important role in ovarian cancer metastasis. Here, we show that only ovarian cancer cell lines with LPA
migratory response undergo peritoneal metastatic colonization. LPA-stimulated cell migration is required for
metastatic colonization because knockdown of LPA receptor subtype 1 (LPAR1) abolishes this event. However,
the difference in metastatic potentials is not caused by the absence of LPAR1 because both metastatic and
nonmetastatic lines express similar levels of LPAR1. Instead, we find that LPA can activate Rac only in metastatic
cells and that metastatic colonization of ovarian cancer cells necessitates Rac activity. These results thus suggest
that LPA-induced Rac activation is a prerequisite for ovarian cancer metastasis. In metastatic cells, Rac
activation is facilitated by SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex and the integrity of this tri-complex is essential for LPAstimulated cell migration and metastatic colonization. We show that at least 1 member of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tricomplex is absent in nonmetastatic ovarian cancer cells and reexpressing the missing one conferred them with
metastatic capability. Importantly, coexpression of SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1, but not of any individual member of
SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex, correlates with advanced stages and shorter survival of ovarian cancer patients.
Our study implicates that the integrity of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex is a determinant of ovarian cancer
metastasis. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9979–90. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic cancers mainly due to complication of metastasis (1).
Unlike other solid tumors that rely on the vasculature for
metastasis, ovarian cancer is predominantly confined within
the abdominal cavity and spread by direct extension to
adjacent organs and/or disseminate throughout the peritoneal cavity (2, 3). A widely recognized behavior of ovarian
cancer is its ability to seed the abdominal cavity with tumor
implants, subsequent migration of tumor cells into peritoneum and underlying organs, and the formation of ascites

(3, 4). Apparently, the ability of ovarian cancer cells to migrate
is essential for ovarian cancer metastasis.
Cell migration is a complex process involving the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton that is facilitated by the members of the Rho GTPases including Rac, Cdc42, and Rho (5–7).
In the process of cell migration, Rac facilitates the formation
of actin-rich membrane ruffle, called lamellipodia, at the
leading edge of migrating cells. Cdc42 regulates cell polarity
and filopodia formation, thus controlling the direction of cell
movement. Rho controls the formation of stress fibers and
maintains focal adhesions at the rear of the cells (6). Ras has
also been implicated to play an important role in cell migration because microinjection of Ras-neutralizing antibody
blocks cell migration (7) and forced expression of constitutively active Ras mutant enhances ovarian cancer cell migration (8). As Ras can activate Rac through Tiam1 (9), b-PIX (10),
or SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex (11, 12), it is likely that Ras
may facilitate cell migration by regulating Rac activity.
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a growth factor–like phospholipid and has been uniquely linked to ovarian malignancies. For example, LPA triggers protease production/
activation (13, 14) and Cox-2 expression (15), thus facilitating
ovarian cancer cell invasion. It also promotes angiogenesis by
inducing the expression of various proangiogenic factors
including VEGF (16), IL8 (17), and Gro-a (18). Moreover,
LPA can be produced and secreted into peritoneal cavity
by both ovarian cancer cells (19, 20) and mesothelial cells

(21). Importantly, LPA is present at high levels in ascites of
ovarian cancer patients (22–25) and potently stimulates ovarian cancer cell migration (8, 26, 27). Therefore, ascite-borne
LPA is likely to play a critical role in ovarian cancer metastasis
by facilitating cell migration.
In this study, we demonstrated an excellent correlation
between LPA migratory responses and metastatic potentials
in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. Preventing LPA-stimulated cell migration by silencing LPA receptor subtype 1
(LPAR1) diminished peritoneal metastatic colonization of
ovarian cancer cells, implicating the importance of LPAstimulated cell migration in ovarian cancer metastasis. LPA
activates Rac only in metastatic cells, and a signaling pathway
consisting of Ras-SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex mediates LPAinduced Rac activation. Interestingly, 1 or more members of
SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex are absent in nonmetastatic
ovarian cancer cells; however, reexpressing the missing member converts the nonmetastatic lines to metastatic ones.
Finally, we show that SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 coexpression, but
not any one alone, correlates with advanced clinical stage
and shorter survival of ovarian cancer patients.

female nude mice (Hsd: athymic Nude-Foxn1nu, Harlan Sprague Dawley) were intraperitoneally injected with 107 cells per
mouse. To determine the role of LPAR1, SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1
in metastatic colonization, SK-OV3 and HEY cells expressing
shRNAs against these genes were intraperitoneally injected
into mice. To determine the importance of Rac activity, cells
expressing constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1G12V) or dominantnegative Rac1 (Rac1T17N) were injected into mice. Five weeks
after injection, the mice were sacrificed and autopsied. Visible
metastatic implants were also collected and weighed. All
procedures were approved by the Institution Animal Care
Committee at Medical College of Georgia.

Materials and Methods

Rac, Cdc42, and Rho activity assays
Activation of Rac/Cdc42, and Rho was measured with the
Rac/Cdc42 and the Rho activity assay kits (Cellbio Labs). To
determine the effect of LPA on Rac, Cdc42, or RhoA activity,
cells (2  106 cells per 10-cm dish) were serum-starved for 2 days
and then stimulated with 10 mmol/L of LPA for various times.
The cells were lysed and analyzed for Rac, Cdc42, or RhoA
activity. To determine the effect of constitutively active Ras on
Rac activity, HEY, IGROV1, OVCAR3, and SK-OV3 cells were
infected with empty or H-RasG12V-containing retrovirus for
2 days followed by 2-day puromycin selection. The cells were
lysed and analyzed for Rac activity. To determine how silencing
Tiam1, SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 affected LPA-induced Rac activation, HEY and SK-OV3 cells were incubated with lentiviral
vectors containing the respective shRNAs for 2 days and starved
for another 2 days. The cells were stimulated with 10 mmol/L of
LPA for 2 or 5 minutes followed by the analysis of Rac activity.
To determine the effect of forced expression of SOS1, EPS8, and
ABI1 on LPA-induced Rac activation, TOV21G, IGROV1, and
OVCAR3 cells were infected with lentiviral vectors encoding
SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1, respectively, for 2 days and starved for
another 2 days. The cells were stimulated with 10 mmol/L of LPA
for 5 minutes followed by the analysis of Rac activity.

Cells, shRNAs, and other reagents
All cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal
calf serum at 37 C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5%
CO2. The shRNA sequences for each target genes were
designed using web-based Block-iT program (Invitrogen)
and subcloned into pLV-shRNA vector (Biosettia). Information for shRNA sequences, antibodies, and other reagents are
described in Supplementary Data.
Transwell cell migration assay
Transwell cell migration was assayed as previously
described (28). Briefly, the lower phase of Transwell was
coated with 10 mg/mL of collagen I or laminin, and serumfree medium with or without 10 mmol/L of LPA was added to
lower chambers. Serum-starved cells (105 per well) were added
to Transwells and allowed to migrate for 4 hours. Cells that
remained in Transwells were removed with cotton swabs, and
cells attached on the lower phase of Transwells were stained
with crystal violet solution. The stained cells were solubilized
with 10% acetic acid and quantitated on a microplate reader at
600 nm. To determine the involvement of Rac in cell migration, cells were infected with a lentiviral vector containing
Rac1G12V or Rac1T17N for 2 days and then starved for 2 days
followed by the analysis of cell migration. To determine the
effect of silencing or forcing the expression of LPAR1, SOS1,
EPS8, and ABI1 on cell migration, cells were infected with
lentiviral vectors encoding either shRNAs or cDNAs of LPAR1,
SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 for 2 days and then starved for 2 days
followed by the analysis of cell migration.
Peritoneal metastatic colonization assay
Peritoneal metastatic colonization assays were performed as
previously described (29, 30). Briefly, cells in the log phase were
trypsinized and resuspended in PBS. Six-week-old athymic

Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated by DNase I and reverse transcribed with SuperScriptase II (Invitrogen). Generated cDNA was subjected to
real-time PCR to measure LPAR1, LPAR2, LPAR3, and GAPDH
levels with the respective TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystem). The expression levels were standardized by comparing
the Ct values of target with that of GAPDH.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were cultured on 10 mg/mL of collagen I–coated
coverslips overnight in serum-free condition and then treated
with 10 mmol/L of LPA for 30 minutes. The cells were fixed
with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton
X-100 followed by 1-hour incubation with rhodomine-conjugated phalloidin. The polymerized actin was visualized using a
fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss).
Histochemistry
Specimens were collected from 64 epithelial ovarian cancer
patients who underwent initial treatment at Zhongnan

Rac in Ovarian Cancer Metastasis

Hospital of Wuhan University from July 2002 to July 2006 (their
clinicopathologic parameters are described in Supplementary
Table S1). Patients were followed up until November 2009.
Overall survival was defined from initial treatment until
cancer-related death or the last follow-up. Samples were
processed in compliance with a protocol approved by the
Ethics Committee of Wuhan University. All experiments conformed to the legal mandates implemented in China, and
written informed consent was received from each patient. The
immunohistochemistry of SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 was performed as previously described (31). Briefly, 4 mm thick
sections of formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked by 3% hydrogen peroxide treatment. Sections were
blocked with rabbit serum and incubated with antibodies
against SOS1, EPS8, or ABI1. Antigens were visualized by
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Immunostaining was evaluated by 2 pathologists without knowledge
of patients’ clinical information. All 3 antigens were found to
be localized in cytoplasm. Extent of immunostaining was
graded on the basis of the percentage of cells displaying
staining. "" is considered as negative staining (<10%); "þ",
"þþ", and "þþþ" were considered as positive staining (10%–
25%, 25%–50%, and >50%, respectively).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of cell migration, metastatic implant
weights, and LPAR1 mRNA levels were performed by ANOVA
and Student's t test. The chi-square test and Fisher's exact test
were used to compare covariates between SOS1/EPS8/ABI1
tri-complex staining and clinicopathologic parameters. Survival curves were plotted according to the estimate of Kaplan
and Meier. The log-rank test was used to determine the
significance of differences in survival distribution. Statistical
analyses were aided by SPSS (release 15.0; SPSS Inc.). All
statistical tests were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered
to be significant.

Results
LPA migratory response is associated with ovarian
cancer metastatic colonization
The fact that LPA levels are elevated in ascites of ovarian
cancer patients and LPA serves as a motility stimulator
prompted us to hypothesize that LPA-stimulated cell migration is necessary for ovarian cancer metastasis. To test it, we
first determined whether LPA migratory responses correlated
with metastatic potentials in ovarian cancer cells. Transwell
migration assay showed that LPA increased cell migration in
ES2, HEY, OVCAR433, OVCAR5, and SK-OV3 lines on both
collagen I- and laminin-coated surfaces but did poorly in
HEC1A, IGROV1, OVCAR3, and TOV21G lines (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1). With the aid of a well-established
peritoneal seeding model (29, 30), we found that animals
receiving LPA-responsive lines (ES2, HEY, OVCAR433,
OVCAR5, and SK-OV3) displayed overt metastatic implants
on omentum, liver, diaphragm, and mesentery (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, metastatic colonization

www.aacrjournals.org

was not detected in animals receiving LPA-unresponsive lines
(HEC1A, IGROV1, OVCAR3, and TOV21G) (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2). These results show that LPA migratory
response correlates with metastatic potential in ovarian cancer cells.
LPAR1 is known to mediate LPA-stimulated cell migration
in various cell types including ovarian cancer cells (32–34).
We lentivirally introduced LPAR1, LPAR2, or LPAR3 shRNA
into metastatic SK-OV3 and HEY cells and confirmed that
these shRNAs specifically reduced their respective target
expression (Supplementary Fig. S3). Knockdown of LPAR1
greatly inhibited LPA-stimulated cell migration in SK-OV3
and HEY cells (Fig. 1C), whereas LPAR2 shRNA displayed
slight inhibition and LPAR3 shRNA exhibited no effect on
LPA-stimulated cell migration (Supplementary Fig. S3). In
the following experiment, we intraperitoneally injected control (luciferase shRNA) or LPAR1-knockdown cells into nude
mice. Five weeks later, mice receiving control cells developed metastatic implants in their peritoneal cavities. However, mice receiving LPAR1-knockdown cells had much less
metastatic colonization and the weight of implants was
reduced by greater than 90% in both SK-OV3 and HEY cells
(Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S4). These results suggest
that LPA-stimulated cell migration is required for ovarian
cancer metastasis.
Rac is activated only by LPA in metastatic ovarian
cancer cells and required for metastatic colonization
To determine what caused the difference in LPA migratory
responses between metastatic and nonmetastatic cells, we
initially measured the levels of LPAR1 mRNA in these lines.
Except HEC1A that did not have detectable LPAR1 mRNA,
metastatic and nonmetastatic lines exhibited similar LPAR1
mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S5). Subsequently, we lentivirally overexpressed LPAR1 in IGROV1, OVCAR3, and SK-OV3
cells. Although SK-OV3 cells with LPAR1 overexpression displayed greater LPA migratory response than the parental cells,
enforced LPAR1 expression could not render nonmetastatic
IGROV1 and OVCAR3 cells responding to LPA for cell migration or undergoing metastatic colonization (Supplementary
Fig. S5). These results indicate that the defective LPA migratory response in nonmetastatic lines occurs downstream
of LPAR1.
Because of the critical role of cytoskeleton reorganization in
cell migration (26), we next examined the effect of LPA on
cytoskeleton reorganization. Cells were treated with LPA
followed by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin
to detect F-actin, which was observed on the plasma membrane of unstimulated cells (Fig. 2A). Exposure to LPA led to
dramatic actin reorganization in metastatic HEY and SK-OV3
cells but did little in nonmetastatic IGROV1 and OVCAR3 cells
(Fig. 2A). As cytoskeleton reorganization is facilitated by Rac,
Cdc42, and Rho (5), we examined the effect of LPA on their
activities in these lines. Rho was similarly activated by LPA in
all lines (Fig. 2B). Cdc42 was slightly activated by LPA in
OVCAR3 cells and unaffected in other lines (Fig. 2B). In
contrast, LPA significantly activated Rac in metastatic HEY
and SK-OV3 cells but not in nonmetastatic IGROV1 and

completely abolished LPA-stimulated cell migration in these
cells (Fig. 2C). In parallel, we expressed constitutively active
Rac1 (Rac1G12V) in nonmetastatic IGROV1, OVCAR3, and
TOV21G lines and found that enforced Rac1G12V expression
rendered them responsive to LPA for cell migration (Fig. 2C).
We next injected dominant-negative Rac1 (Rac1T17N)expressing HEY or SK-OV3 cells into mice and found that
Rac1T17N expression eliminated 100% and 98.35% metastatic
colonization in mice, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6A
and Fig. 2D). Meanwhile, we injected constitutively active Rac1
(Rac1G12V)-expressing IGROV1 and OVCAR3 cells into mice.
Although there was no detectable metastatic implant in mice
receiving control cells, implants were readily seen in mice
receiving Rac1G12V-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B
and Fig. 2D). These results implicate that Rac is a key
metastasis regulator.
SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex is involved in LPAinduced Rac activation and metastatic colonization
To characterize the signaling pathway mediating LPAinduced Rac activation, we turned our attention on Ras, as
LPA can activate Ras in metastatic ovarian cancer cells (8, 26)
and Ras can activate Rac in various cell types (9, 11). We
introduced dominant-negative H-Ras (H-RasT17N) into HEY
and SK-OV3 cells and found that inhibiting Ras activity
abrogated LPA-induced Rac activation (Fig. 3A), suggesting
that Ras mediates LPA-induced Rac activation. We next treated
nonmetastatic IGROV1 and OVCAR3 cells with LPA and
observed that LPA effectively activated Ras in both cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S7), ruling out the possibility that inability
of LPA to activate Ras led to the defect in Rac activation. In
further experiment, we introduced constitutively active Ras (HRasG12V) into ovarian cancer cells. H-RasG12V elevated Rac
activity in metastatic HEY and SK-OV3 cells, and LPA treatment did not further increase Rac activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
H-RasG12V could not activate Rac in nonmetastatic IGROV1 or
OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that Ras can
activate Rac only in metastatic ovarian cancer cells.
Ras can activate Rac through Tiam1 (9), b-PIX (10), or SOS1/
EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex (11). We determined their potential
involvement by individually silencing their expression in HEY
and SK-OV3 cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S8A and D).
Although Tiam1 shRNAs and b-PIX siRNA pool effectively
inhibited their respective target expression, they did not alter
LPA- or H-RasG12V–induced Rac activation (Supplementary
Fig. S8A and D). In contrast, SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 shRNAs all
blocked LPA- or Ras-G12V–induced Rac activation (Fig. 3B).
Transwell migration assay also showed that knockdown of
SOS1, EPS8, or ABI1, but not Tiam1, greatly decreased LPAinduced cell migration in SK-OV3 and HEY cells (left panel,
Fig. 3C). Similarly, disrupting SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex
blocked RasG12V-induced migration of SK-OV3 (right panel,
Fig. 3C). The inhibitory effect of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 shRNAs on
Rac activation and cell migration was specific, as forcing the
expression of respective murine counterparts largely restored
these 2 events (data not shown). When SOS1-, EPS8-, or ABI1knockdown cells were analyzed for peritoneal metastatic
colonization, we detected a significant reduction in the weight

9984

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

of metastatic implants in mice receiving knockdown cells
compared with mice receiving the control cells (Fig. 3D
and Supplementary Fig. S9).
SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex is not intact
in nonmetastatic ovarian cancer cells
To further investigate the importance of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1
tri-complex in metastasis, we performed immunoblotting to
examine the expression of SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 in ovarian
cancer lines. All members of this tri-complex were expressed
in metastatic ES2, HEY, OVCAR433, OVCAR5, and SK-OV3
lines (Fig. 4A). In contrast, at least 1 member of this tricomplex was absent in nonmetastatic lines: EPS8 in IGROV1,
ABI1 in OVCAR3, SOS1 in TOV21G line, and all three in
HEC1A line (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the absence of
SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex member was responsible for
the defect in LPA migratory response and metastatic colonization, SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 were expressed in TOV21G,
IGROV1, and OVCAR3 cells, respectively. LPA both activated
Rac (Fig. 4B) and stimulated cell migration in TOV21G/SOS1,
IGROV1/EPS8, and OVCAR3/ABI1 cells (Fig. 4C). We next
injected TOV21G/SOS1, IGROV1/EPS8, OVCAR3/ABI1, and
the respective empty-vector control cells into nude mice
followed by analyzing metastatic colonization. There was no
detectable metastatic implant in mice receiving control cells
(Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S10). In contrast, implants
were readily visible in the peritoneal cavities of mice that
received TOV21G/SOS1, IGROV1/EPS8, or OVCAR3/ABI1
cells (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S10). These results
further demonstrate the necessity of an intact SOS1/EPS8/
ABI1 tri-complex in ovarian cancer metastasis.
Coexpression of EPS8, ABI1, and SOS1 correlates with
clinical malignancy of human ovarian cancer patients
As laboratory study may not recapitulate clinical ovarian
malignancy, we extended our study by examining the
expression of SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 in 64 ovarian cancer
specimens (Supplementary Table S1). Immunohistochemistry showed that SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 were positive in 48.4%,
62.5%, and 75% of the ovarian cancer specimens, respectively
(Fig. 5A and B). When the expression status of the individual
member of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex was analyzed,
we found that none of them was statistically correlated to
age, histologic types, pathologic grades, clinical stages,
or patient survival (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 5B
and C).
Our results with the established cell lines indicate that the
integrity of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex is essential for
ovarian cancer metastasis. We thus focused on the specimens that were immunoreactive for all 3 members of this tricomplex. Of 64 samples, 26 specimens were stained positive
for all 3 proteins and designated as "co-positive" (Supplementary Table S1). The remaining specimens were negative
for 1 or more of these proteins and designated as "conegative." The status of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 coexpression
was independent of age, histologic types, or pathologic grade
(Table 1). However, the "co-positive" percentage increased
significantly along with the more advanced stages (stage I,

patient survival (estimate mean survival of "co-negative"

SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex represents a reliable marker
for ovarian cancer metastasis.

Discussion
High levels of LPA is present in ascites of ovarian cancer
patients (22–25) and can potently stimulate ovarian cancer
cell migration (8, 27). In this study, we found that only
ovarian cancer cell lines with LPA migratory response
undergo peritoneal metastatic colonization (Fig. 1A and
B), suggesting a potential link between LPA-stimulated cell
migration and ovarian cancer metastasis. Although recent
studies indicated that multiple LPA receptors may contribute to LPA-stimulated cell migration (21, 35), we showed
that silencing LPAR1 largely abrogated both LPA-stimulated
cell migration and metastatic colonization (Fig. 1C and D).
The discrepancy may be caused by the means to silence LPA
receptors, as synthetic siRNAs were used in these early
studies whereas we used shRNAs for LPAR1 knockdown. A
recent study reports that direct administration of LPA in vivo

9986

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

led to enhanced ovarian cancer metastasis and reduced
animal survival (36). Enforced LPA receptor expression has
also been shown to increase ovarian cancer aggressiveness in
the xenograft model (35). These findings all support the
notion that LPA migratory response is a prerequisite for
ovarian cancer metastasis.
Cell migration requires reorganization of actin cytoskeleton that is regulated by the members of Rho GTPases
including Rac (37). We show that LPA only induces cytoskeleton reorganization in metastatic ovarian cancer cells
(Fig. 2A), indicating that members of Rho GTPase family may
not be properly activated by LPA in nonmetastatic cells. This
possibility is substantiated, as LPA significantly activates
Rac only in metastatic cells (Fig. 2B). Inhibiting Rac activity
abolished LPA-stimulated cell migration and peritoneal
metastatic colonization of metastatic cells, whereas constitutively active Rac1 confers nonmetastatic cells with LPA
migratory response and the ability to metastasize (Fig. 2C
and D). Rac activation has been shown to correlate with
hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer metastasis (38,
39). Our findings extend the importance of Rac activation in
ovarian cancer metastasis.
Tiam1, b-PIX, and SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex can mediate Ras-induced Rac activation (9–11). We show that silencing any member of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex, but not

Tiam1 or b-PIX, abrogates LPA- or Ras-induced Rac activation, cell migration, and peritoneal metastatic colonization
(Fig. 3B–D). SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex has been shown to
mediate EGF- or PDGF-induced Rac activation and actin
remodeling (40). This complex is also involved in phosphoinositide 3-kinase–induced Rac activation (41). Our studies
present another example of the usage of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tricomplex for Rac activation. Our observation with ovarian
cancer cells is different from that of an early report in which
LPA is shown to activate Rac through Tiam1 in murine

fibroblasts (32). This difference may be attributed to species
and cell lineage difference.
As silencing any member of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex
is sufficient to diminish ovarian cancer cell migration and
metastatic colonization, it indicates that the integrity of
SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex may determine ovarian cancer
metastatic potentials. Indeed, metastatic lines express all 3
members of this tri-complex whereas at least 1 member is
absent in nonmetastatic lines (Fig. 4A). Introducing the
missing member in the respective line renders it capable

of undergoing metastatic colonization (Fig. 4D). EPS8 has
been reported to promote fibrosarcoma and oral squamous
carcinoma cell migration (42, 43). ABI1 can positively regulate breast cancer cell migration and invasion (44). Moreover, depletion of SOS1 blocks prostate cancer cell migration
and invasion (45). Although only a single member was
focused in these studies, they support an essential role of
SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex in cell migration and metastasis.
Recent studies indicate the clinical relevance of the
expression of SOS1 and EPS8 in cancer progression. The
level of SOS1 is elevated in prostate cancer specimens with
high Gleason scores (45). EPS8 overexpression is often
detected in advanced stage of thyroid cancer (46), pancreatic
cancer (47), oral squamous carcinoma (43), and pituitary
tumors (48). To our knowledge, no study has been reported
on the status of ABI1 in clinical cancer specimens. In this
study, we detected the expression of SOS1, EPS8, and ABI1 in
clinical ovarian cancer specimens (Fig. 5A). However, the
expression of any individual member of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tricomplex alone is not statistically associated with any clinicopathologic parameters of patients (Supplementary
Table S2). Instead, we find that SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 coexpression is significantly correlated with advanced stage and
shorter survival (Table 1, Fig. 5B and C). This observation
is in excellent agreement with the findings generated from
the established cell lines that intact SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tricomplex is required for ovarian cancer metastasis.

Expression of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

Our study demonstrates the importance of SOS1/EPS8/
ABI1 tri-complex in ovarian cancer metastasis. Although we
show it with the established ovarian cancer cell lines that
may not fully simulate clinical setting, the consistency seen
in multiple cell lines, the convergence of loss- and gain-offunction findings, and especially the excellent correlation
observed between SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 coexpression and
advanced disease stage/shorter patient survival strongly
argue against any confounding influence derived from our
experimental studies. Our studies suggest that the integrity
of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 tri-complex determines ovarian cancer
metastasis and that therapeutic approach may be developed
by targeting this tri-complex.
