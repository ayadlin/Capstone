Abstract
We previously showed that genistein, the major bioactive
component of soy isoflavones, acts as a radiosensitizer and
potentiates prostate tumor cell killing by radiation in vitro
and in animal tumor models in vivo. However, when given
alone in vivo, pure genistein promoted increased lymph node
metastasis, which was not observed with a soy isoflavone
mixture consisting of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein. In this
study, we show that soy inhibits tumor cell growth and
potentiates radiation-induced cell killing in vitro like pure
genistein. In an orthotopic model, combining soy isoflavones
with tumor irradiation inhibited prostate tumor growth. To
determine the molecular mechanisms by which soy isoflavones
potentiate radiotherapy, we investigated apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) and nuclear
factor KB (NF-KB), two signaling molecules involved in survival
pathways. Soy isoflavones decreased APE1/Ref-1 expression in
vitro, whereas radiation up-regulated it. Pretreatment with
soy isoflavones followed by radiation inhibited APE1/Ref-1
expression. APE1/Ref-1 decrease correlated with decreased
DNA-binding activity of NF-KB mediated by soy isoflavones
and radiation, thus promoting cell killing. In vivo treatment
of prostate tumors with soy isoflavones and radiation downregulated APE1/Ref-1 protein expression and NF-KB activity,
confirming the molecular alterations observed in vitro. The
down-regulation of APE1/Ref-1 and NF-KB by isoflavones,
in vitro and in vivo, supports our hypothesis that these
markers represent biological targets of isoflavones. Indeed,
a 2-fold increase in APE1/Ref-1 expression, obtained by
cDNA transfection, resulted in a 2-fold increase in NF-KB
DNA-binding activity, and both of which were downregulated by soy isoflavones, confirming the cross-talk
between these molecules and, in turn, causing radiosensitization. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2141–9]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in
American men as well as the second leading cause of male cancer
deaths (1). Epidemiologic studies have shown that men who
consume diets rich in soy isoflavones have lower incidence of

prostate cancer (2, 3). Emerging data suggest that genistein,
a major bioactive isoflavone component of soybeans, enhances
the efficacy of conventional cancer therapy by modulating key
signaling molecules involved in controlling cell proliferation
pathways, such as nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) (4). NF-nB is a major
transcription factor involved in the synthesis of critical cell survival
proteins in response to cellular stress (5–9). NF-nB is constitutively
activated in prostate cancer in vitro and correlates with tumor
progression (8, 9). Genistein was found to inhibit the activation of
NF-nB leading to cell growth inhibition by affecting the cell cycle
and inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro (10–12).
Localized prostate cancer is sensitive to conventional radiotherapy using megavoltage photons (X-rays), yet residual disease
causes clinical relapse (13). Radiation causes DNA damage,
triggering tumor cell apoptosis and death. However, in response
to cellular stress, radiation can also cause the activation of DNA
repair and/or NF-nB, thus driving the cells towards survival and
promoting radioresistance, possibly contributing to clinical relapse.
We have previously shown that pure genistein acts as a radiosensitizer and potentiates radiation-induced tumor cell killing of
human PC-3 prostate cancer cell line in vitro (14, 15). Translation
of these studies in vivo showed that genistein, given with primary
prostate tumor irradiation, significantly enhanced inhibition of
prostate tumor growth and increased mouse survival, using a metastatic orthotopic PC-3 xenograft tumor model (16). Furthermore,
genistein combined with radiation also controlled spontaneous
metastasis to para-aortic regional lymph nodes. Paradoxically,
we discovered that pure genistein, given as a single treatment
modality in this model, promoted increased metastasis to lymph
nodes (16). This novel observation was reproduced in a syngeneic
orthotopic RM-9 prostate tumor model (17), raising concerns
regarding soy-based clinical trials for cancer patients. We recently
found that a mixture of soy isoflavones, consisting of genistein,
daidzein, and glycitein, was safer than genistein in the in vivo
model because it did not cause increased spontaneous lymph node
metastasis. In addition, soy isoflavones were effective at potentiation of tumor growth inhibition induced by radiation, resulting in
the arrest of prostate tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis to
lymph nodes (18). Such a mixture of soy isoflavones is more
representative of the soy supplements used for human interventions, whereas pure genistein is not used as a supplement.
Therefore, in the current study, we compared the effect of a soy
isoflavone mixture to that of pure genistein, given alone or in
conjunction with radiation, on molecular events in vitro and in vivo
using human prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer orthotopic
tumor model, respectively.
Our previous studies showed that genistein causes pleiotropic
molecular effects in prostate cancer cells (4), including the

inactivation of the Akt/NF-nB pathway (10, 14, 19). Our initial
studies showed that radiation-induced activation of NF-nB was
completely inhibited by the pretreatment of PC-3 cells with
genistein (14). Studies of the mechanism of activation of the
transcription factor NF-nB indicate that NF-nB DNA binding is
redox-regulated by and dependent upon apurinic/apyrimidinic
(AP) endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1), a multifunctional
protein involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity and in
the regulation of gene expression (20–23). Therefore, in the current
study, we focused our investigation on APE1/Ref-1 and NF-nB, two
major signaling molecules involved in determining tumor cell fate,
i.e., death versus survival, in response to treatment.
As a major component of the DNA base excision repair pathway,
APE1/Ref-1 is the primary enzyme responsible for the recognition
and incision of noncoding and mutagenic AP sites in DNA (24).
However, APE1/Ref-1 also functions as a redox activator of multiple
cellular transcription factors, including NF-nB (25–28). Levels of
APE1/Ref-1 have been shown to be dramatically elevated in various
types of cancer, including prostate cancer (29–32). Increased APE1/
Ref-1 expression was shown to promote tumor resistance to both
ionizing radiation and chemotherapy (32–34). However, a decrease
in APE1/Ref-1 expression was shown to render cells more sensitive
to a variety of DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation
(35, 36). Therefore, in the current study, we explored the potential
of APE1/Ref-1 as a molecular target for the enhanced prostate
cancer radiosensitivity mediated by soy isoflavones.
The effect of soy isoflavones combined with radiation on APE1/
Ref-1 modulation was compared with that on NF-nB regulation
based on previous studies demonstrating cross-talk between
these two molecules (20–23, 26). Our data show that soy isoflavones decreased the expression of APE1/Ref-1 in vitro and
in vivo, whereas radiation caused up-regulation. However, pretreatment with soy isoflavones followed by radiation inhibited the
expression of APE1/Ref-1. The decrease in APE1/Ref-1 expression
correlated with decreased DNA-binding activity of NF-nB mediated
by soy isoflavones and radiation in vitro and in vivo, indicating a
possible mechanism of increased cell killing and tumor growth
inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating
increased prostate tumor radiosensitivity by decreasing APE1/Ref-1
using soy isoflavones.

Materials and Methods
Prostate cancer cells. PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line (American
Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was cultured in F-12K culture
medium (CM) with supplements (14, 15).
Treatment with soy isoflavones. The soy isoflavones mixture
( formulation 115H7625 COA; Solae, St. Louis, MO) consists of 43%
genistein, 21% daidzein, 2% glycitein, 2.5% protein, 11.9% fat, and 1.7%
water, with the remainder being carbohydrate. Both soy isoflavones and
pure genistein (LKT Laboratories, Toronto, Canada) powders were dissolved
in 0.1 mol/L Na2CO3 to make a 10 mmol/L stock solution. Then, soy
isoflavones or genistein were serially diluted 1:10 and 1:100 in culture
medium and added to cells plated in flasks or plates to obtain final
concentrations of 5 to 60 Amol/L (14). Control cells were incubated with
equivalent dilutions of Na2CO3 in CM.
For animal experiments, soy isoflavones or genistein were dissolved in 0.1
mol/L Na2CO3 and mixed with sesame seed oil at a 2:1 ratio before
treatment to facilitate oral gavage and to avoid irritation of the esophagus
by Na2CO3 (16). Mice were treated p.o. by gavage either with 1 mg/day soy
or an equivalent dose of 0.43 mg/day pure genistein. Control and radiationonly–treated groups received a mixture of 0.1 mol/L Na2CO3 and sesame
seed oil.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

Treatment with radiation. Cells in 15-mL tubes, T25 flasks, or T75 flasks
were irradiated with photons using a 60Co unit (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.
Theratron 780, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) as previously detailed (14, 15).
Quantification of apoptosis by histone/DNA ELISA. PC-3 cells
were treated with 0 to 60 Amol/L pure genistein or soy isoflavones for
72 h and then treated with 3 Gy radiation. At 24 h after radiation treatment,
cells were processed for detection of apoptosis using the Cell Apoptosis
ELISA Detection Kit (Roche, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (37).
Spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was determined using
ULTRA Multifunctional Microplate Reader (TECAN, Durham, NC) at
405 nm. The enrichment factor was calculated by dividing absorbance of
treated cells by absorbance of control untreated cells.
Analysis of cell survival by clonogenic assay. Cells were treated with
soy isoflavones for 24 h, then irradiated with 3 Gy photons (14, 15). After
treatment, cells were plated in triplicate wells of six-well plates in 2 mL CM
as follows: 500 cells per well for control, 1,000 cells per well for soy
isoflavones or radiation alone, and 3,000 cells per well for soy isoflavones +
radiation treatments, based on cell titrations previously determined (14).
Following 10 days incubation, in the presence of soy isoflavones, at 37jC in
a 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 incubator, colonies counted (clones of at least
50 cells were counted as one colony). The plating efficiency was calculated
for each well, and the surviving fraction was normalized to control
cells (14).
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. Extraction of nuclear
proteins and cytoplasmic proteins was accomplished using Sigma CelLytic
NuCLEAR Extraction Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Western blot
analysis was completed as previously described (14) using monoclonal antiAPE1/Ref-1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). AlphaEaseFC
imaging software (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA) was used to quantify
resultant bands (28). As an internal control for nuclear protein loading,
membranes were reprobed with anti-retinoblastoma antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or for cytoplasmic protein loading with
anti–h-actin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; ref. 37).
Fluorescence staining for confocal microscopy. PC-3 cells were
cultured onto coverslips in six-well plates and treated with 30 Amol/L soy
isoflavones for 48 h, then irradiated with 3 Gy. One hour after radiation, cells
were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100,
and incubated overnight at 4jC with monoclonal anti-APE1/Ref-1 antibody
(Novus Biologicals). After washing with PBS, cells were exposed for 2 h to
FITC-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Alexa
Fluor 488, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prepared in 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and 0.05% Triton X-100. Stained cells were analyzed by Zeiss Laser
Scanning inverted confocal microscope. Excitation wavelength/detection
filter settings were as follows: 585/665 nm longpass and Alexa fluor 488,
495/519 nm. Cells were visualized in dual-channel imaging.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) was accomplished according to the method described by
Chaturvedi et al. (38), with minor modifications. Briefly, 5 Ag of nuclear
proteins were incubated with IRDye-700 labeled NF-nB oligonucleotide
(LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The DNA-protein complex was run on
8.0% native polyacrylamide gel using buffer containing Tris-glycine buffer
(pH, 8.5) and then visualized by Odyssey Infrared Imaging System using
Odyssey Software Release 1.1. Equal protein loading was ensured by
immunoblotting 10 Ag of nuclear protein with antiretinoblastoma
antibody (37).
Transfection of PC-3 cells with APE1/Ref-1 cDNA. PC-3 cells were
transfected either with empty plasmid pCMV6-XL5 (pCMV6) or with the
plasmid containing APEX nuclease 1 (pCMV6.APE1; OriGene, Rockville,
MD). PC-3 cells were transfected with the cDNA plasmid vectors (5 Ag DNA)
using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 6 h incubation, the medium
was replaced, and the cells were further incubated for 48 h. Then, the
cells were treated with soy for 24 h at a concentration of 60 Amol/L,
which showed a significant inhibition of APE1/Ref-1 (Fig. 4A) because the
exposure to soy was only 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the
Sigma CelLytic NuCLEAR Extraction Kit as described above. APE1/Ref-1
Western blot analysis and EMSA analysis for NF-nB were done using the
transfected and nontransfected PC-3 nuclear extracts.

Experimental animals. Male nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu, 5–6 weeks old;
Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in sterile facilities, fed sterile water
and Lab Diet 5021 (Purina Mills, Inc., Richmond, IN) ad libitum. The mice
were used in accordance with Animal Care and User Guidelines of Wayne
State University under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee as required by the American Association for the
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
Experimental protocol in orthotopic PC-3 animal model. PC-3/PI
prostate tumor cell lines were generated from PC-3 human prostate tumors
as previously described (16, 39, 40). PC-3/PI cells (5  105) in 20 AL HBSS
were injected into the mouse prostate as previously detailed (16, 17, 39, 40).
Following prostate implantation with PC-3/PI cells, before initiating
treatment, a few mice were killed to monitor and confirm tumor growth
and size in the prostate. On days 7 to 10 after cell injection, mice had
established 0.4-cm prostate tumors compared with 0.2-cm normal prostate.
Ten mice per group were used, and mice were randomized into the
following six treatment groups: (a) untreated control; (b) genistein, daily
oral gavage; (c) soy isoflavones, daily oral gavage; (d) radiation only; (e)
genistein + radiation; (f ) soy isoflavones + radiation. On day 8, treatment
with soy isoflavones mixture or pure genistein was initiated by oral gavage
as described above and continued once a day for 3 days. On day 11, prostate
tumors were irradiated with 5 Gy photon radiation as previously detailed
(16, 40). Daily isoflavone treatment was resumed on day 12 and continued
for the duration of the experiment (16, 17). In separate experiments, mice
were killed on day 19 postinjection for Western blot and EMSA analyses of
prostate tumor extracts and on day 32 postinjection to resect and weigh
tumor-bearing prostates (16, 17).
Tissue preparation for histology. Tissues were fixed in 10% zinc
formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (16, 17). Tumor sections
(5 Am) were stained with monoclonal anti-APE1/Ref-1 antibody (Novus
Biologicals) by immunohistochemistry as previously described (16).
Statistical analysis. Comparisons among the various treatment groups
of the apoptosis, Western blot, and EMSA assays were analyzed by twotailed unpaired Student’s t test. For the clonogenic assay, ordinary leastsquares regression was used to analyze the relationship between soy dose
and radiation on cell survival. For in vivo data analysis, the shape of the
outcome was assessed to determine whether the assumptions of normal
theory tests were tenable. For tumor weight, no useful transformation could
be found; therefore, Kruskal-Wallis rank tests were used to evaluate the
statistical significance of differences between groups. Multiple comparisons
between treatment conditions for each end point were made using Holm’s
procedure to protect against inflated type I errors.

Results
Soy isoflavones potentiate apoptosis and inhibition of cell
growth by radiation in vitro. We have previously shown that pure
genistein enhances apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth caused
by radiation (14, 15). To determine whether the soy isoflavone
mixture is effective at potentiation of radiation-induced cell killing,
we have compared pure genistein to soy isoflavones. Initially,
the effect of various doses of soy isoflavones on the induction of
apoptotic cell death was tested compared with identical doses of
genistein. PC-3 cells were treated with 0, 15, 30, and 60 Amol/L
genistein or soy isoflavones for 72 h and then tested for apoptosis
using the histone/DNA ELISA detection kit. A dose-dependent
increase in apoptotic cell death was observed with soy isoflavones
at levels comparable to those obtained with pure genistein
(Fig. 1A). An intermediate dose of 30 Amol/L genistein or soy
isoflavones was selected for the combined treatment with
radiation. PC-3 cells were pretreated with 30 Amol/L genistein or
soy isoflavones for 72 h then irradiated with 3 Gy photons and,
24 h later, were tested for apoptosis (Fig. 1B). The level of apoptosis
caused by genistein or soy isoflavones combined with radiation
(11- to 13-fold increase) was significantly greater than that caused

by isoflavones (4-fold increase, P < 0.001) or radiation alone
(5.7-fold increase, P < 0.005).
To evaluate the long-term effect of soy isoflavones and radiation
on cell growth, treated cells were assayed using a clonogenic assay.
Dose titration clonogenic assays using pure genistein alone or
combined with radiation in vitro showed that pretreatment of
PC-3 cells with genistein at 15 Amol/L enhanced the cell killing
caused by low-dose 3 Gy photon radiation (14, 15). These studies
were repeated using soy isoflavones instead of pure genistein. PC-3
cells were pretreated with 5, 10, and 15 Amol/L soy isoflavones for
24 h then irradiated with 3 Gy photons. After radiation, cells
were plated for a clonogenic assay. Soy at 5 Amol/L did not inhibit
cell growth (P > 0.50; Fig. 1C), whereas 30 Amol/L soy isoflavones
completely inhibited colony formation in this 10-day assay (data

not shown). A significant inhibition in cell survival fraction was
obtained with increasing doses of 10 and 15 Amol/L soy isoflavones
(P < 0.001; Fig. 1C). These doses caused a further and significant
cell survival inhibition up to 95% when combined with radiation
compared with radiation or soy alone (P < 0.001; Fig. 1C). The
effect of soy alone at 15 Amol/L or combined with radiation was
more potent than that of genistein at 15 Amol/L alone or with
radiation (P < 0.001; Fig. 1C). The combined treatment caused an
inhibition greater than additive relative to each single treatment
alone. These data were consistently reproduced in independent
experiments.
Soy isoflavones down-regulate expression of APE1/Ref-1
protein. To elucidate the role of survival pathway molecules in the
inhibition of cell growth by genistein/soy isoflavones, we analyzed
the expression of APE1/Ref-1, a molecule involved in DNA repair
that also functions as a redox activator of multiple cellular
transcription factors. PC-3 cells were treated with 15, 30, and
60 Amol/L pure genistein or soy isoflavones for 72 h, reproducing
the conditions selected for the detection of apoptosis in histone/
DNA ELISA assay (Fig. 1A). Expression of APE1/Ref-1 was
determined in nuclear extracts from treated cells by Western blot
analysis. PC-3 cells strongly express APE1/Ref-1 protein (Fig. 2A). A
dose-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of APE1/Ref-1
protein was observed with increasing doses of either pure genistein
or soy isoflavones. Based on these data, a dose of 30 Amol/L pure
genistein or soy isoflavones that caused a marked decrease in
APE1/Ref-1 protein expression was selected to determine the
kinetics of APE1/Ref-1 down-regulation. PC-3 cells were treated
with 30 Amol/L pure genistein or soy isoflavones for 24, 48, and
72 h, and nuclear APE1/Ref-1 protein expression was determined
by Western blot analysis. A time-dependent decrease in the
expression of APE1/Ref-1 protein was shown, resulting in an
almost complete down-regulation of APE1/Ref-1 after 72 h treatment with 30 Amol/L pure genistein or soy isoflavones (Fig. 2B). A
strong basal level of APE1/Ref-1 protein was observed in the
cytosol of PC-3 cells by Western blot analysis, which was decreased
by treatment with either with 30 Amol/L of pure genistein or soy
isoflavones (Fig. 2C).
Inhibition of radiation-induced APE1/Ref-1 expression in
PC-3 cells pretreated with soy isoflavones. We have shown that
genistein/soy isoflavones down-regulate APE1/Ref-1 protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B).
To investigate the role of APE1/Ref-1 down-regulation in potentiation of radiation-induced cell killing by genistein/soy isoflavones,
we analyzed the expression of APE1/Ref-1 following combined
treatment. PC-3 cells were pretreated with 30 Amol/L genistein or
30 Amol/L of soy isoflavones for 72 h followed by 3 Gy photon
radiation. Cells were harvested at 1 h postradiation, and
expression of APE1/Ref-1 protein was determined in the nuclear
fraction by Western blot analysis. Both genistein and soy
isoflavones caused a decrease in nuclear expression of APE/Ref-1
compared with control cells (Fig. 2D). The expression of APE1/Ref1 was increased by 3 Gy of radiation (Fig. 2D), representing an
early event in the cell response to radiation because of its role in
DNA repair. This up-regulation of APE1/Ref-1 expression by
radiation was inhibited by pretreatment with genistein or soy
isoflavones (Fig. 2D).
Confocal microscopy analysis of APE1/Ref-1 cellular localization
revealed that APE1/Ref-1 was strongly expressed in the cell nucleus
and cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Following radiation, an increased nuclear
staining was observed (Fig. 3B), whereas soy isoflavones alone

(Fig. 3C) or combined with radiation (Fig. 3D) caused decreased
levels of APE1/Ref-1 in the nucleus. These data corroborate our
findings using Western blot analysis of APE1/Ref-1 protein
expression (Fig. 2D).
Soy isoflavones inhibit NF-KB DNA-binding activity. We have
previously shown that genistein caused a decrease in NF-nB DNAbinding activity, a well-known transcription factor critically
involved in the survival of cells (4, 14). In contrast, we found that
radiation increased NF-nB activity, possibly promoting radioresistance. However, radiation-induced activation of NF-nB activity
was completely inhibited by the pretreatment of cells with
genistein (14). To determine whether the soy isoflavone mixture

also down-regulates NF-nB DNA-binding activity and inhibits
radiation-induced activation, these experiments were repeated
with soy isoflavones. PC-3 cells were treated with 15, 30, and
60 Amol/L pure genistein or soy isoflavones for 72 h, reproducing
the conditions selected for previous experiments. A dosedependent decrease in NF-nB DNA-binding activity was observed
with increasing doses of either pure genistein or soy isoflavones
(Fig. 4A). Based on these data, a dose of 30 Amol/L pure genistein
or soy isoflavones that caused a marked decrease in NF-nB DNAbinding activity was selected to determine the kinetics of NF-nB
activity. PC-3 cells were treated with 30 Amol/L pure genistein or
soy isoflavones for 24, 48, and 72 h, and NF-nB DNA-binding
activity was determined by EMSA. A time-dependent decrease in
NF-nB DNA-binding activity was shown, resulting in almost
complete inhibition of NF-nB DNA binding after 72 h treatment
with 30 Amol/L pure genistein or soy isoflavones (Fig. 4B).
Soy isoflavones inhibit APE1/Ref-1–induced NF-KB activity
in APE1/Ref-1 overexpressing PC-3 cells. We have shown that
soy isoflavones down-regulate APE1/Ref-1 expression and inhibit
the DNA-binding activity of NF-nB (Figs. 2 and 4A and B). To
elucidate whether a molecular cross-talk occurs between APE1/
Ref-1 and NF-nB that is involved in soy-induced killing of PC-3
cells, the effect of overexpressing APE1/Ref-1 on NF-nB DNAbinding activity was investigated using APE1/Ref-1 cDNA plasmid
transfection of PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells were transfected with
pCMV6.APE1 for 48 h, then treated with soy isoflavones for 24 h,

and tested for APE1/Ref-1 expression and the DNA-binding activity
of NF-nB. Transfection of PC-3 cells with empty pCMV6 plasmid
did not affect APE1/Ref-1 expression and did not alter the APE1/
Ref-1 decrease mediated by soy treatment (Fig. 4C). Compared with
control, nontransfected cells, and pCMV6-transfected cells, PC-3
cells transfected with pCMV6.APE1 showed a 2-fold increase in
nuclear expression of APE1/Ref-1, confirming its overexpression
induced by gene transfection (Fig. 4C). Treatment of APE1/Ref-1
overexpressing PC-3 cells with soy isoflavones caused about a 50%
decrease in APE1/Ref-1 expression (Fig. 4C). The effect of 2-fold
overexpression of APE1/Ref-1 was striking and also resulted in a
2-fold increase in NF-nB DNA-binding activity compared with
control and pCMV6-transfected PC-3 cells (Fig. 4C). This 2-fold
increase in NF-nB DNA-binding activity of pCMV6.APE1-transfected cells was decreased by almost 50% by soy treatment
(Fig. 4C). Transfection of PC-3 cells with empty plasmid did not
affect NF-nB DNA-binding activity or its inhibition by soy
treatment (Fig. 4C).
Pretreatment with soy isoflavones inhibits radiationinduced activation of NF-KB. We have shown that genistein/
soy isoflavones down-regulate NF-nB DNA-binding activity in a
dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A and B). To investigate
whether the down-regulation of NF-nB DNA-binding activity
could potentiate radiation-induced cell killing by genistein/soy
isoflavones, we analyzed NF-nB DNA-binding activity following
combined treatment. PC-3 cells were pretreated with 30 Amol/L

genistein or 30 Amol/L of soy isoflavones for 72 h followed by
3 Gy photon radiation. Cells were harvested at 1 h postradiation,
and NF-nB DNA-binding activity was determined by EMSA. Both
genistein and soy isoflavones caused a decrease in NF-nB DNAbinding activity compared with control cells (Fig. 4D). NF-nB
DNA binding was increased in response to 3 Gy radiation
(Fig. 4D), representing an early response to cell stress induced by
radiation. This up-regulation of NF-nB DNA-binding activity by
radiation was inhibited by pretreatment with genistein or soy
isoflavones (Fig. 4D). It is important to note that soy isoflavones
are as potent as pure genistein at inhibiting NF-nB DNA-binding
activity.
Soy isoflavones potentiate the inhibition of tumor growth by
radiation and down-regulates APE1/Ref-1 and NF-KB in vivo.
We have shown in vitro that soy isoflavones potentiate tumor cell
killing by radiation and cause alterations in the expression and
activity of APE1/Ref-1 and NF-nB, two major signaling molecules
involved in cell death or survival pathways. To investigate whether
these findings occur in vivo, we have treated established PC-3
prostate tumors with a combination of soy isoflavones and tumor
irradiation. Mice bearing established PC-3 prostate tumors (0.4 cm
in size) were pretreated with p.o. soy isoflavones mixture, given by
gavage at a dose of 1 mg/day for 3 days, or an equivalent dose of
pure genistein (0.43 mg/day) followed by prostate tumor irradiation
at a dose of 5 Gy photons as previously described (16). One day

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

after radiation, soy isoflavones or genistein treatments were
resumed and given everyday for 3 continuous weeks (Fig. 5A).
Serum levels of about 3 Amol/L genistein and 0.5 Amol/L daidzein
were measured in mice treated with genistein, whereas equal levels
of genistein (1.7 Amol/L) and daidzein (1.6 Amol/L) were measured
in mice treated with soy isoflavones compared with baseline levels
in control mice (0.3 Amol/L; ref. 18). The effect of genistein alone
was not significant; however, genistein + radiation significantly
inhibited tumor growth by 85% compared with each modality alone
(P < 0.05; Fig. 5B), confirming our previous studies (16). Soy
isoflavones combined with radiation caused a significant inhibition
of primary prostate tumor growth (86%, P < 0.001) compared with
soy isoflavones alone (40%, P < 0.001) or radiation alone (70%, P <
0.05; Fig. 5B). Therefore, these findings show that the combination
of soy isoflavones with radiation led to a greater control of primary
tumor growth than soy isoflavones or radiation alone, similar to
genistein and radiation treatment (16).
To investigate the molecular alterations induced in situ by soy
isoflavones and radiation, the in vivo experiment described above
was repeated, with the exception that mice were killed earlier to
detect molecular changes in prostate tumors. Tumor extracts
were obtained on day 19 (Fig. 5A), 1 week after combined
treatment with radiation and soy isoflavones to determine the
expression and DNA-binding activity of APE1/Ref-1 and NF-nB,
respectively. Interestingly, treatment of prostate tumors with either

APE1/Ref-1 and Prostrate Cancer Radiotherapy

pure genistein or soy isoflavones down-regulated the expression of
APE1/Ref-1 protein, similar to our findings in vitro (Fig. 5C). The
expression of APE1/Ref-1 was still relatively high in mice treated
with radiation, but was down-regulated in mice treated with
radiation combined with genistein or soy isoflavones (Fig. 5C).
The DNA-binding activity of NF-nB measured in prostate tumors
also followed a similar pattern to that observed in vitro. Treatment
with either pure genistein or soy isoflavones alone decreased
NF-nB DNA-binding activity, whereas this activity remained high in
response to radiation treatment (Fig. 5D). However, treatment with
pure genistein or soy isoflavones significantly inhibited the NF-nB
DNA-binding activity observed in response to radiation in prostate
tumors (Fig. 5D).
Expression of APE1/Ref-1 in prostate tumors treated with
soy isoflavones and radiation. To further determine whether soy
isoflavones alone or combined with radiation caused decreased
in situ alterations in the expression of APE1/Ref-1 in prostate
tumors, sections of PC-3 prostate tumors were immunostained for
APE1/Ref-1 expression. Control tumors showed intensive nuclear
staining in >95% of tumor cells, indicating a high level of expression
of APE1/Ref-1 in prostate tumors (Fig. 6A) confirming previous
observations (29). Following radiation treatment, tumor cells
also showed a high level of APE1/Ref-1 staining. Areas of fibrosis
as a result of tumor destruction were also observed (Fig. 6B) as
previously described (16). Treatment with either genistein or soy
isoflavones caused a decrease in the intensity of APE1/Ref-1
staining in the nuclei of tumor cells (Fig. 6C). Combined treatment
of radiation with either genistein or soy isoflavones showed
comparable findings; these prostate tumors consisted of numerous
abnormal giant atypical cells that showed marked cytologic
changes such as cytomegaly or nucleomegaly as previously
described (16). Interestingly, these giant cells also showed
the absence or decreased intensity of nuclear APE1/Ref-1 staining

(Fig. 6D ) compared with control tumors (Fig. 6A). These
observations were consistent with those obtained by Western blot
analysis of tumor extracts (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
We previously showed that pure genistein potentiates prostate
cancer tumor cell killing by radiation in vitro (14, 15). The current
study shows that the mixture of soy isoflavones is equally effective
in causing apoptotic cell death, inhibiting prostate cancer cell
growth, and potentiates radiation-induced cell killing in vitro as
observed with pure genistein (14, 15).
To address the molecular events driving soy isoflavones
potentiation of radiation, we studied APE1/Ref-1 expression and
NF-nB activity, two signaling molecules involved in survival
pathways (5–7, 19, 24–27). These molecules were strongly expressed
by PC-3 cells in vitro. Soy isoflavones or pure genistein inhibited
APE1/Ref-1 expression in the cell nuclear fraction in a time- and
dose-dependent manner. Cytosolic expression of APE1/Ref-1 was
also decreased. The nuclear expression of APE1/Ref-1 was increased
by radiation, probably representing an early event in the cell
response to radiation because of its role in DNA base excision
repair. Up-regulation of APE1/Ref-1 expression by radiation was
inhibited by pretreatment with soy isoflavones. These findings by
Western blot analysis were confirmed by confocal microscopy
analysis and suggest that APE1/Ref-1 protein expression is downregulated by soy isoflavones and up-regulated by radiation, and
pretreatment with soy isoflavones inhibits radiation-induced APE1/
Ref-1 expression. Microarray analysis also showed that the level of
APE1/Ref-1 mRNA is decreased by 5-fold with genistein treatment
(data not shown), corroborating our protein expression data.
The down-regulation of APE1/Ref-1 expression by soy isoflavones alone or combined with radiation correlated with the

inhibition of NF-nB DNA-binding activity. We found that soy
isoflavones inhibit NF-nB DNA-binding activity in a time- and
dose-dependent manner with comparable kinetics to the decrease
in APE1/Ref-1.
Soy isoflavones also block radiation-induced NF-nB activation,
confirming that they are potent inhibitors of NF-nB like pure
genistein (14).
In vivo, using the orthotopic PC-3 model, we showed that the
combination of soy with radiation led to a greater control of
primary tumor growth than soy or radiation alone, as observed
with genistein (16). The in vitro molecular alterations of APE1/
Ref-1 and NF-nB induced by soy isoflavones and radiation were
reproduced in situ in prostate tumors. These molecules were
strongly expressed in untreated PC-3 prostate tumors. APE1/Ref-1
protein expression and NF-nB DNA-binding activity were inhibited
by treatment with soy isoflavones alone or combined with
radiation. Interestingly, APE1/Ref-1 immunostaining was decreased
in prostate tumor sections from mice treated with soy isoflavones
alone or combined with radiation, confirming in vivo protein
expression by Western blot analysis.
Our results clearly show that the down-regulation of APE1/Ref-1
and NF-nB by isoflavones in our in vitro studies could be
recapitulated in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that these markers
truly represent biological targets of isoflavones. Their downregulation by isoflavones could potentially radiosensitize prostate
cancer tumor cells. This is in direct agreement with previous
studies demonstrating that increased APE1/Ref-1 expression
promoted tumor resistance to ionizing radiation (32, 33), and
a decrease in APE1/Ref-1 expression increased radiosensitivity
(35, 36). APE1/Ref-1 and NF-nB DNA are essential for transcription
of downstream genes involved in cellular proliferation, tumor
growth, invasion, and metastasis (4–7, 27). Their inhibition by soy
isoflavones could drive the cells toward apoptotic pathways and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

block activation of radiation-induced survival pathways, leading to
increased cell killing observed in vitro and tumor growth inhibition
in vivo. We recently showed that key molecules regulated by NF-nB
and involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis are altered by
genistein and radiation (14, 18). These downstream events included
the up-regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 and down-regulation of cyclin B1,
the up-regulation of the proapoptotic molecule Bax, and the
suppression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and survivin molecules,
leading to increased G2-M cell cycle arrest and an increase in
apoptosis (14, 18).
The down-regulation of APE1/Ref-1 and NF-nB by soy isoflavones raised the question of the cross-talk between these
molecules. In the current study, we have now shown that
overexpression of APE1/Ref-1, obtained by cDNA transfection of
PC-3 cells, caused a concomitant increase in NF-nB DNA-binding
activity. Moreover, soy isoflavones treatment of APE1/Ref-1 overexpressing PC-3 cells significantly inhibited APE1/Ref-1 expression
with a corresponding decrease in the NF-nB DNA-binding activity.
These findings confirm a molecular cross-talk between APE1/Ref-1
and NF-nB, which is likely to be the molecular mechanism
responsible for soy-induced killing of PC-3 cells and radiosensitization. In addition to DNA base excision repair, APE1/Ref-1
functions as a redox activator of multiple cellular transcription
factors (25–28). NF-nB activity was found to be redox regulated by
and dependent on APE1/Ref-1 (20). APE1/Ref-1–mediated reduction of the p50 subunit in the nucleus was shown to be a necessary
step for NF-nB activation (21). Deletion of the redox-sensitive
domain of APE1/Ref-1 inhibited tumor necrosis factor-induced
NF-nB activation (22). Loss of APE1/Ref-1 resulted in decreased
NF-nB DNA binding and transcriptional activation and increased
susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (23).
Together, these findings establish APE1/Ref-1 as an essential
upstream signaling molecule regulating NF-nB.

APE1/Ref-1 and Prostrate Cancer Radiotherapy

The dual nature of APE1/Ref-1, redox and repair, could lead
to tumor cell survival by ensuring DNA integrity of promoter
sequences while simultaneously reducing oxidized transcription
factors such as NF-nB (41). Selective targeting of APE1/Ref-1 could
enhance conventional cancer treatment such as radiotherapy
(42, 43). Soy isoflavones and other dietary agents could downregulate APE1/Ref-1 expression, thereby altering its function as a
redox activator of NF-nB, ultimately affecting the balance between
cell survival and cell death. Given the safety and efficacy of soy
isoflavones, our findings support the clinical use of soy isoflavones
