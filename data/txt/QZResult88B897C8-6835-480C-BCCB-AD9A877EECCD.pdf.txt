Abstract
Stem cell antigen Sca-1 is implicated in murine cancer stem cell
biology and breast cancer models, but the role of its human
homologs Ly6K and Ly6E in breast cancer are not established.
Here we report increased expression of Ly6K/E in human breast
cancer specimens correlates with poor overall survival, with an
additional speciﬁc role for Ly6E in poor therapeutic outcomes.
Increased expression of Ly6K/E also correlated with increased
expression of the immune checkpoint molecules PDL1 and
CTLA4, increased tumor-inﬁltrating T regulatory cells, and
decreased natural killer (NK) cell activation. Mechanistically,

Ly6K/E was required for TGFb signaling and proliferation in
breast cancer cells, where they contributed to phosphorylation
of Smad1/5 and Smad2/3. Furthermore, Ly6K/E promoted cytokine-induced PDL1 expression and activation and binding of NK
cells to cancer cells. Finally, we found that Ly6K/E promoted drug
resistance and facilitated immune escape in this setting. Overall,
our results establish a pivotal role for a Ly6K/E signaling axis
involving TGFb in breast cancer pathophysiology and drug
response, and highlight this signaling axis as a compelling realm
for therapeutic invention. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3376–86. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

GDF10, a novel tumor suppressive cytokine (6). Recently, Ly6K
and Ly6E, another members of the Ly6 gene family, have been
shown to be involved in human malignancies and have been
suggested as potential therapeutic targets for cancer immunotherapy (9–14). Here we set out to investigate their role in
breast cancer progression and the underlying cellular signaling
mechanisms and relate these ﬁndings to clinical cases of breast
cancer using clinical informatics.

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the
process of breast cancer oncogenesis and therapeutic sensitivity
is profoundly affected by pathways that also infringe on cancer
stem cell biology (1, 2). One of the gene families at the interface
of cancer stem cell biology and cancer biology is the human Ly6 gene family, which is related to the murine stem cell antigen-1
gene (Sca-1) or mouse (m) Ly6A. It encodes a set of glycosylated cell surface proteins that have been recognized as stem cell
markers (1, 3, 4). The mLy6A confers resistance to radiotherapy
and promotes metastatic behavior of mammary tumors in
animal models (5). Earlier work from our laboratory has
demonstrated that mLy6A regulates TGFb, PTEN, and ERK/AKT
cell signaling pathways (6–8). Mechanistically, mLy6A binds to
TGFb receptor-1 (TbR1), disrupts the TbR1 ligand complex, and
inhibits Smad2/3 signaling. In addition, increased mLy6A
expression in tumor cells correlates with a reduced level of

Ly6K/E–TGFb Axis in Breast Cancer Tumorigenesis

the presence of 4 mg/mL of polybrene and selection carried out
with 1 mg/mL of puromycin.
For overexpression, the open reading frame containing clones
(Ly6K, Ly6E) in G418 selection markers were obtained by Origene
MD. The cells were transfected using Fugene HD and selected in
1 mg/mL G41.
The KHYG-1 natural killer (NK) cell line stably expressing
KIR2DS1 002 have been generated and used as described
previously (37). Prior to each assay, cells were screened for
the surface expression of KIR2DS1 by immunolabeling
using 2DS1 MoAB–CD158a/h (clone EB6B or 11PB6) and
ﬂow assay. Zeocin was removed prior to NK-cell coculture
assays.
The cells were obtained by ATCC, which provided cells
authenticated by short random repeat DNA sequencing. Upon
arrival, cells were propagated and stored in multiple vials as
recommended.
Colony assay
Cells (5,000/dish) were seeded into 100-mm dishes in 10 mL of
DMEM containing 5% FBS. After 7 to 10 days, colonies were ﬁxed
in 50% trichloroacetic acid, stained with sulforhodamine B, and
solubilized in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 10), and absorbance was
measured at 560 nm (6).
Nude mice xenograft assay
500,000 cells were injected subcutaneously into opposite
ﬂanks in ﬁve-week-old athymic nude mice. For the mice
receiving T47D cells, mice were transplanted with controlled
release (60 days release time, 0.18 mg/pellet total dose) 17bestradiol pellet (Innovative Research of America). Tumor volume was determined by caliper measurements at weekly intervals. All animal studies were performed under a protocol
approved by Georgetown University's Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit
and cDNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
performed in triplicate in an ABI 7900 instrument using SYBRGreen detection (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All primer sequences are described in Supplementary Table S1. The expression of each target gene was
normalized to the expression of GAPDH using SDS2.4 software
(Applied Biosystems).
Reporter assays
Cells were seeded in triplicate into 24-well plates at a density of
4  104 cells/well and then transfected with 100 ng of Smadresponsive ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 ng of pCMV
Renilla luciferase (for normalization) using Fugene HD (Roche).
Luciferase activity was measured at 48 hours after transfection
using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a
Leader 50 Luminometer (Gen-Probe).
TGFb, IFNg, and IL4 treatment
Cells were seeded at 60% cell density and serum starved in 0.5%
charcoal-stripped serum overnight. Cells were treated with

www.aacrjournals.org

100 pg/mL TGFb1 for 30 minutes, 10 ng/mL IFNg, or 50 ng/mL
IL4 for overnight.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 60 mmol/L octylglucoside, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 125 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 10% glycerol, phosphatase,
and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 C. A total of 20 to 50 mg of lysate was separated in a
4% to 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibody was incubated for
either 1.5 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4 C.
Secondary antibody was incubated for 30 minutes at room
temperature, and proteins were visualized with West Pico
Stable (Pierce). For Western blot analysis, the primary antibodies anti-Ly6K (cat no. AF6648; R&D Systems), Ly6E (cat no.
NBP1 68553; Novus Biologicals), pS423/425 Smad3 (cat no.
9520), pS463/465 Smad1/5 (cat no. 9516), Smad2/3 (cat no.
9523), and Smad5 (cat no. 12534) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology.
Semiquantitative IHC
IHC was performed using tissue staining HRP-DAB System
kits (R&D Systems). Antigen retrieval was performed using
citrate buffer (10 mmol/L citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH
6.0). The primary antibodies were used for 1 hour at room
temperature using anti-Ly6K antibody (AF6648; R&D Systems)
at 1:100 and anti-Ly6E antibody (NBP1 68553; Novus Biologicals) at 1:400 dilution on clinical samples of breast cancer
(tissue microarrays; USBiomax, Histopathology and Tissue
Shared Resources at Georgetown University). Slides were semiquantitatively scored in a blind fashion using both intensity
and percent positive cells. Intensity was scored on a scale of 0 to
3 as follows: 0 ¼ negative, 1 ¼ weak, 2 ¼ moderate, and 3 ¼
intense. Percent positive labeling was scored on a scale of 0 to
3 as follows: 0 ¼ negative, 1 ¼ <10%, 2 ¼ 11%–50%, and 3 ¼
>50%. Both these values were added for ﬁnal numerical score. A
score of 2 and below was considered negative and a score of 3
and above was considered positive.
NK-cell activation assay
NK-cell activation was measured by the release of granzyme B
and the proinﬂammatory cytokine MIP1a from the
KIR2DS1 002 NK (KHYG-1) cell line (37,49). Brieﬂy, 2DS1
NK cells were cocultured with indicated cells at a ratio of 1:2 for
48 hours at 37 C in a 5% CO2 environment. Each assay
condition consisted of 1  105 effectors (2DS1 NK cells) and
0.5  105 targets in 200-mL culture media in one well of a
48-well plate. After 48 hours, the cell culture supernatant was
collected and stored at 80 C. Using the Luminex 100 platform
(Luminex), secreted levels of granzyme B and MIP1a were
assayed via the Procarta Immunoassay Kit (eBiosciences, Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Flow cytometry
Single-cell suspension primary cultures or cell lines were prepared by incubation with 0.05% trypsin for 1 to 2 minutes,
ﬁltering through a 40-mm cell strainer, two washes with 1  PBS,
and blocking for 15 minutes on ice with 1  PBS supplemented

Results
Increased expression of Ly6K and Ly6E in breast cancer
Analysis of the normal tissue samples showed that Ly6K was
highly expressed in testis and Ly6E in liver tissue among the array of
normal tissue samples (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Analysis of DNA
copy number in invasive ductal breast carcinoma in TCGA dataset
showed a signiﬁcant genomic ampliﬁcation of Ly6K and Ly6E in
cancer tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Statistical analysis across
seven comparisons (cancer vs. normal) in three independent studies TCGA (unpublished), Richardson and colleagues (16), and
Curtis and colleagues (17) showed increased Ly6K and Ly6E in
breast cancer (Supplementary Fig. S1C; Supplementary Table S2).

Increased expression of Ly6K and Ly6E and overall patient
survival
The status of gene expression and survival outcome was
assessed by using PROGgeneV2 online tool, which showed that
increased Ly6K (Fig. 1A) and increased Ly6E status (Fig. 1B)
correlate well with poor 5-year overall survival in a breast cancer
study (18) and in the Netherland Cancer Institute (6, 9–14, 19–23),
respectively.
We used comprehensive NKI dataset to study metastasis-free
survival. The NKI study did not detect Ly6K expression data, but
provided us with a wide range of information regarding the status
of Ly6E expression and therapeutic outcome. Increased Ly6E
expression is correlated with a poor 5-year metastasis-free chemotherapy outcome (Fig. 1C and D) and hormone therapy (Fig.
1E and F).

Ly6K and Ly6E expression in a breast cancer cell lines and breast
cancer tissue
We next screened a panel of breast cancer cell lines for the
RNA expression and found that triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) cell lines expressed a higher levels of Ly6K (Fig. 2A),
whereas Ly6E expression was detected in all breast cancer cell
lines with higher levels in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2B). Ly6K and Ly6E protein expression was tested in breast
cancer clinical specimens. An IHC study containing 52 clinical
samples (n ¼ 29 ER-positive, n ¼ 23 TNBC) revealed that 87%
of TNBC tumors express detectable levels of Ly6K, whereas 24%
TNBC tumors express Ly6E. Seventy-six percent of ER-positive
tumors express Ly6E and 33% of ER-positive tumors express
Ly6K (Fig. 2C).

B, indicated cells were seeded in low

cells gave rise to signiﬁcantly fewer
tumors. D, the qRT-PCR and Western

E, control and Ly6E knockdown T47D
cells were seeded in low dilution for
colony assays. Ly6E knockdown cells
have signiﬁcantly reduced colony
formation. F, indicated cells were
transplanted into opposite ﬂanks of
nude mice previously transplanted
with control-release estrogen pellets.
Control cells gave rise to xenograft
tumors in 3 weeks, whereas Ly6E
knockdown cells gave rise to
signiﬁcantly fewer tumors. The P
values and fold change are calculated
compared with control cells.

Effect of Ly6K and Ly6E on breast cancer growth
To investigate the functional role of Ly6K in breast cancer
cells, we chose to stably knockdown Ly6K in MDA-MB-231
TNBC cells (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Ly6K knockdown cells gave rise to fewer colonies (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Ly6K knockdown cells gave rise to fewer and
smaller xenografts (Fig. 3C). MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit a
strong metastatic phenotype (24, 25), so we examined the
effect of Ly6K knockdown in these cells on the invasion and
distant colonization of tumor cells in well-characterized zebraﬁsh model (26–28). The Ly6K knockdown cells showed diminished cell migration and colonization (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To investigate the functional role of Ly6E in breast cancer cells,
we chose to stably knockdown Ly6E in T47D ER-positive cells
(Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S2B). In colony assays, Ly6E
knockdown cells gave rise to fewer colonies (Fig. 3E and
Supplementary Fig. S3B). T47D cells have been demonstrated
to establish xenograft tumors when supplemented with estrogen (29). Ly6E knockdown led to reduced xenograft tumors
(Fig. 3F). These results suggest that Ly6K or Ly6E are required
for tumorigenic growth.
Ly6K and Ly6E promote gene signatures associated with drug
resistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast
cancer
We next examined whether Ly6K and Ly6E contribute to tumor
growth by inducing characteristic gene signatures that lead to drug
resistance or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Ly6K
knockdown in MDA-MB-231 and Ly6E knockdown in T47D cells
signiﬁcantly reduced RNA levels of the ABCC3 (Fig. 4A), an
inducer of chemotherapeutic drug resistance (30), ABCG2

knockdown also reduced the RNA expression of NANOG (Fig.
4D), CD34 (Fig. 4E), and PSCA (Fig. 4F), well-known stem cell
genes that have been recently described to induce drug resistance
(33–35). Next, we tested for the effect of Ly6K and Ly6E on
regulators of EMT pathway, which is closely related to drug
resistance and tumor metastasis. MDA-MB-231 cells express
higher levels of Zeb1, an EMT inducer than T47D cells (Fig.
4G, compare ﬁrst bar in main and inset graphs). The knockdown

N-cadherin (Fig. 4K), reversing the hallmark of EMT switch.

We have previously shown that the mouse Ly6A/E (Sca-1) gene,

Ly6K and Ly6E are required for cancer cell escape from immune surveillance. A, signiﬁcant coexpression of Ly6K and Ly6E with CD25, CTLA4, and PDL1 was
observed in clinical cases of breast cancer by statistical analysis across six comparisons in three independent datasets [1, TNBC n ¼ 211 vs. non-TNBC
n ¼ 1340 (17); 2, grade 1 n ¼ 89 vs. grade 3 n ¼ 857 (17); 3, grade 1 n ¼ 19 vs. grade 3 n ¼ 69 (50); 4, TNBC n ¼ 50 vs. non-TNBC n ¼ 101; TCGA #5, normal n ¼ 61 vs.
invasive ductal n ¼ 389; 6, TNBC n ¼ 46 vs. non-TNBC n ¼ 250] visualized by Oncomine (see Supplementary Fig. S5 for detailed information on each comparison).
B, Luminex assay using conditioned medium showed that NK cells released signiﬁcantly higher levels of granzyme B (I) and MIP1a (II) when cocultured with
either Ly6K and Ly6E knockdown cancer cells. 2DS1 NK cells and indicated MDA-MB-231 cells were labeled with DiO and DiI cell-labeling dyes, respectively, and
cocultured for 48 hours before ﬂow cytometry analysis. The bar graph shows the percentage ratio of cancer cells bound to NK cells. NK-cell binding was
increased with Ly6K knockdown and Ly6E knockdown cells (III). C, indicated cells were treated with IFNg or IL4 and PDL1 surface expression was analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry. The knockdown of Ly6K or Ly6E led to reduced PDL1 expression induced by IFNg (I) or IL4 (II). D, working model suggesting that Ly6K and
Ly6E affect multiple aspects of cancer progression involving TGFb signaling, drug response, and tumor immune escape.   , P < 0.05;    , P < 0.005;    , P < 0.0005.

reduced the endogenous phosphorylation status of Smad3 (TGFb
signaling) and Smad1/5 (BMP signaling), suggesting that Ly6K
and Ly6E are required for the increased TGFb/Smad signaling in
cancer cells (Fig. 5B). Loss of Ly6K and Ly6E also reduced levels of
the TGFb-responsive genes PAI1 (Fig. 5C) and cTGF (Fig. 5D).
Next, we investigated whether Ly6K and Ly6E are required for
ligand-induced TGFb/Smad signaling in cancer cells. Knockdown
of Ly6K or Ly6E reduced phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5 and
Smad3 (Fig. 5E). These ﬁndings suggest that Ly6K and Ly6E are
required for endogenous and ligand-induced TGFb and BMP
signaling in cancer cells.

Ly6K and Ly6E facilitate tumor cell escape from immune
surveillance
TGFb signaling plays an important role in the tumor microenvironment including the innate immune response generated by
NK cells and the adoptive immune response carried out by CTLs
(36). A statistical analysis of gene expression in across six comparisons (TNBC vs. non-TNBC, normal vs. cancer) in three independent datasets showed Ly6K and Ly6E correlate signiﬁcantly
with breast cancer subset with increased PDL1, CTLA4 (tumor
immune checkpoint inhibitors), and increased inﬁltration of
suppressive T regulatory cells (marker CD25þ) in Curtis and

colleagues (17), Gluck and colleagues (50), and TCGA (Fig. 6A
and Supplementary Fig. S5).
To evaluate the effect of Ly6K and Ly6E knockdown on NK-cell
activation, we used NK cells expressing KIR2DS1 receptor (37)
and MDA-MB-231 cells, which have HLA-C 02:02, C 17:01
(unpublished data from Drs. Hurley and Upadhyay, Georgetown
University), the classical ligand for the stimulatory KIR2DS1
receptor found on a subset of NK cells. We observed that 2DS1
NK cells released signiﬁcantly higher levels of granzyme B and
MIP1a when cocultured with Ly6K and Ly6E knockdown cells
(Fig. 6B-I and II), suggesting that high expression levels of Ly6K
and Ly6E in cancer cells can reduce NK-cell activation. Binding of
NK cells to cancer cells precedes the NK-cell activation and
subsequent killer cytokine release such as granzyme B. We
observed that knockdown of either Ly6K or Ly6E led to signiﬁcantly increased binding of cancer cells to NK cells (Fig. 6B-III and
Supplementary Fig. S6).
Several cytokines including IFNg and IL4-induced PDL1 expression on the cell surface of cancer cells is a major mechanism of
tumor cell immune escape (38, 39). We found that knockdown of
Ly6K or Ly6E led to reduced stimulation PDL1 expression followed by IFNg and IL4 treatment (Fig. 6C-I and II and Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting that Ly6K or Ly6E is required for
cytokine-induced PDL1 expression by cancer cells. We found that
rescue by forced expression of Ly6K or Ly6E increased colony
growth, reduced granzyme B release, and increased PDL1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S8).

survival data, that the expression of Ly6E may also be a marker of
therapeutic response. Mechanistically, the differential expression
of Ly6K and Ly6E and their effect in tumorigenic processes may be
a function of an altered genetic network speciﬁc to certain tumor
types, which can converge on TGFb signaling. TGFb signaling
regulates both chemotherapy and hormonal therapy drug resistance (47, 48).
The underlying mechanism of the noted phenotypic effects of
Ly6K and Ly6E on tumor immune escape relevant to NK-cell
binding, and cytokine release and PDL1 expression involves
critical essential roles of Ly6K and Ly6E for supporting constitutive TGFb signaling and cancer cells cross-talk with tumor microenvironment especially in cancer immune surveillance (Fig. 6D).
These ﬁnding suggest that the Ly6 family is one of the nodal
centers involved in the regulation of TGFb signaling. Our ﬁndings
suggest that Ly6K and Ly6E are likely to emerge as attractive
upstream targets to speciﬁcally modify TGFb signaling in cancer
cells. We hope this approach will leave the TGFb signaling intact in
normal cells and simultaneously decrease the intrinsic ability of
cancer cells to grow and increase the effectiveness of immune
surveillance, leading to an improved chemotherapy or hormonal
therapy.

Discussion
Stem cell antigen-1, also known as mouse Ly6E/Ly6A, is an
established marker of cancer stem cells (40–42). Sca-1 can regulate tumor suppressor cytokine GDF10 production by cancer
cells and disrupt TGFb signaling by directly sequestering TGFb
receptor-1 (6). In spite of these recent ﬁndings, the role of homo
sapiens Ly6 genes in the biology of human cancer progression
remains poorly understood. In this study, we have revealed several
novel aspects of the human Ly6 genes Ly6K and Ly6E in the
pathobiology of breast cancer progression and tumor immune
escape. Our study reveal the following major ﬁndings: ﬁrst, both
Ly6K and Ly6E are show elevated expression levels at the RNA and
protein level in human breast cancer; second, Ly6K or Ly6E are
prognosis markers for poor overall patient survival; third, Ly6K or
Ly6E are required for the growth of human breast cancer cells;
fourth, Ly6K and Ly6E are required for endogenous and ligandinduced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and Smad1/5 in cancer
cells; and ﬁfth, Ly6K and Ly6E are required for tumor immune
escape. Interestingly, knockdown of Ly6K or Ly6E was sufﬁcient to
induce phenotypic changes.
We found that high Ly6K and Ly6E expression and increased
growth of cancer cells are associated with their ability to maintain
TGFb and BMP signaling in cancer cells. TGFb signaling plays a
central role in growth, metastasis, EMT, and invasiveness of cancer
cells (43–46). The functional role of Ly6 family members, however, may be more complex than a linear regulation of a downstream pathway as highlighted by two ﬁndings: First, Ly6K and
Ly6E expression is segregated in ER-positive and TNBC. Second,
Ly6K and Ly6E are required for high expression levels of several
markers of chemotherapeutic and hormonal drug resistance. The
role of Ly6E in drug resistance was further supported by clinical
