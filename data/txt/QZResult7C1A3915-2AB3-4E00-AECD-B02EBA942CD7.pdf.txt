Abstract
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor survival rates, with initial responses
nearly invariably followed by rapid recurrence of therapy-resistant disease. Drug resistance in SCLC may be
attributable to the persistence of a subpopulation of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) that exhibit multiple drug
resistance. In this study, we characterized the expression of CD133, one important marker of CSC in other cancers,
in SCLC cancer cells. CD133 expression correlated with chemoresistance and increased tumorigenicity in vitro
and in vivo accompanied by increased expression of Akt/PKB and Bcl-2. CD133 expression was increased in mouse
and human SCLC after chemotherapy, an observation conﬁrmed in clinical specimens isolated longitudinally
from a patient receiving chemotherapy. We discovered in CD133þ SCLC cells, an increased expression of the
mitogenic neuropeptide receptors for gastrin-releasing peptide and arginine vasopressin. Notably, these cells
exhibited increased sensitivity to the growth inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of a novel broad spectrum
neuropeptide antagonist (related to SP-G), which has completed a phase I clinical trial for SCLC. Our results offer
evidence that this agent can preferentially target chemoresistant CD133þ cells with CSC character in SCLC,
emphasizing its potential utility for improving therapy in this setting. Cancer Res; 74(5); 1554–65. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most common fatal malignancy in the
developed world. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for
10% to 20% of all lung cancers (1–3) and is highly aggressive,
killing around 20,000 people per year in the United States. SCLC
is a neuroendocrine cancer that secretes and responds to a
wide variety of mitogenic peptide growth factors, typically
gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and arginine vasopressin
(AVP; refs. 4, 5). Patients with SCLC normally become symptomatic only once wide spread metastasis has occurred, therefore are precluded from surgical intervention. Once diagnosed,
chemotherapy with cis-platinum and etoposide is a standard
therapy but although patients initially respond well to treatAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1MRC Centre for Inﬂammation Research, The

ment, the tumors invariably relapse within months with resistant tumors resulting in mortality at 2 years of more than 95%.
The cancer stem-like cell (CSC) theory proposes that tumor
growth can be driven by a population of self-renewing cells that
are able to differentiate and give rise to the heterogenous cell
types that constitute the tumor (6, 7). Putative cancer stem cell–
like cells have been isolated from various malignancies, including brain, breast, and non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC;
refs. 8–10). CD133 (prominin-1), a ﬁve-transmembrane glycoprotein, initially described as a marker speciﬁc for human
hematopoietic progenitor cells has been designated as a marker
of CSCs in different tumor types (11–15). In NSCLC, CD133þ
cells are more tumorigenic than CD133 cells and express genes
involved in stemness, adhesion, motility, and drug efﬂux (6).
Moreover NSCLC cells resistant to cisplatin show increased
expression of CD133 (10, 16).
Expression of neuropeptides has been associated with neoplastic transformation (17), and there is evidence that lung CSC
originates from neuroendocrine cells in the lung, which show
an increased expression and response to neuropeptides (18–
21). We have shown that the development of chemoresistance
to conventional chemotherapy in SCLC cells is accompanied
by an increase in expression of neuropeptide receptors and
subsequently increased sensitivity to broad-spectrum neuropeptide antagonists (22–24), suggesting that targeting neuropeptide receptors on SCLC cells may provide a new strategy to
target chemoresistant disease.
In this study, we show that CD133þ SCLC cells exhibit CSC
properties, form tumors in immunocompromised mice, and

CD133þ SCLC cells are sensitive to neuropeptide antagonist

are resistant to etoposide. In addition, these cells demonstrate
increased neuropeptide receptor expression and increased
sensitivity to growth inhibition by a novel neuropeptide antagonist, peptide-1. Moreover, we show that in human biopsy
specimens, there is an increase in CD133 and GRP-R expression
that correlates with chemoresistance. This suggests that neuropeptide antagonists may selectively target chemoresistant
CSCs and provide a novel therapy for resistant SCLC.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All cell lines were mycoplasma free. SCLC cells; NCI-H69 and
NCI-H345 (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures,
Health Protection Agency, Porton Down, United Kingdom)
and GLC14 and GLC16 cells (22, 25) grew as free ﬂoating
aggregates and were positive for neuronal adhesion molecule
by Western blot analysis. The GLC14 and GLC16 cells were
previously proﬁled by short tandem repeat proﬁling to conﬁrm
their origin from a single patient (25, 26). GRP-R- and V1A-R–
expressing CHO-K1 cells (23) were conﬁrmed receptor positive
by Western blot analysis. RPMI-1640, polyclonal rabbit antihuman AVP-R (V1A), was purchased from Chemicon International, rabbit anti-human GRP-R (Thermo Scientiﬁc), CD133/
1-APC, CD133/2-PE, CD133/1, mouse IgG1-APC and mouse
IgG1-PE (Miltenyi Biotec). Oct3/4 (c-2) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, mouse monoclonal anti–Bcl-2 was from Millipore, and phospho-Akt (ser473) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies were from
Invitrogen.
Cell culture
SCLC cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) 50 U/mL1
penicillin, 50 mg/mL1 streptomycin, and 5 mg/mL1 L-glutamine. For experimental purposes, SCLC cells were cultured in
SITA medium consisting of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 30 nmol/L selenium, 5 mg/mL1 insulin, 10 mg/mL1 105
transferrin, and 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. CHO-K1
cells expressing the human GRP and V1A receptors were
cultured as we described previously (23).
Flow cytometry
Viable cells (106 cells/mL) were incubated with monoclonal
anti-CD133/1 (AC133)-APC or CD133/2 (AC141)-PE (1:100
dilution) for 10 minutes at 4 C and washed twice with PBS.
Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences). Dead cells were eliminated using 1 mg/mL propidium iodide staining (Sigma-Aldrich). Data were processed
using FlowJo software.
CD133 selection
Cells were stained with CD133-1-APC as described above.
For cell sorting, the top 7% most brightly stained cells or the
bottom 7% most dimly stained cells were selected and isolated
using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were eliminated
using propidium iodide. The purity of sorted cells was evaluated by staining the sorted cells with CD133-2, which detects a
second epitope of CD133 antigen.

Chemosensitivity assay
SCLC cells were seeded at 5  104 cells per well of a 96-well
plate in the presence or absence of etoposide or peptide-1 for
72 hours. MTT formazan production (Sigma) was used to
measure viability as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Liquid growth
SCLC cells (5  104 cells/well) in the presence or absence
of mediators were grown for 24 days and cell number was
determined using a NucleoCounter NC-100 (ChemoMetec).
Clonogenic assay
SCLC cells were suspended in RPMI media or SITA media
containing 0.3% agarose in the presence or absence of mediators and layered over a solid base of 0.5% agarose in 35 mm
plastic dishes. The cultures were incubated at 37 C for 30
days. Colonies from 10 separate ﬁelds were counted using a
microscope with a 4 objective. Cloning efﬁciency was
calculated as the percentage of original number of seeded
cells forming colonies of >20 cells.
Apoptosis assay
SCLC cells treated with etoposide or peptide-1 for 72 hours
were cytocentrifuged onto glass slides and stained with May–
Grunwald–Giemsa in which apoptotic cells were assessed
morphologically for the appearance of condensed nuclei. Apoptosis was also evaluated using ethidium bromide/acridine
orange staining.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed as described previously (23) and equilibrated for protein using Pierce BCA protein assay reagent.
Lysates were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed
with primary antibody followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat immunoglobulin G (IgG; Dako).
Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham).
Determination of intracellular Ca2þ concentration
Intracellular Ca2þ concentration was evaluated using the
ﬂuorescent indicator Fura-2-tetraacetoxymethylester AME
(FURA-2-AM 1 mmol/L) as described (27). Ratiometric ﬂuorescence was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer Fluorometric
Spectrophotometer with dual excitation wavelengths of
340 and 380 nm and emission wavelength of 510 nm.
Real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA from sorted cells was extracted using RNeasy kits
(Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using TaqMan
reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). The
expression levels of human GRP-R and human V1A-R in isolated
cells were quantiﬁed using TaqMan gene expression assay kit
(Applied Biosystems). The quantitative PCR reaction was
carried out in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system and data
were analyzed using the System detection software (7500 Fast
system SDS software, Applied Biosystems).

Xenografts
Six-week-old female CD1 nu/nu mice (Harlan) were maintained in 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles with free access to
food and water. All procedures were performed in accordance
with Home Ofﬁce guidelines [Animals (Scientiﬁc Procedures)
Act 1986]. SCLC cells were injected subcutaneously and mice
were randomized into control and treatment groups containing 6 to 8 mice. Treatment was started when the xenografts
reached a diameter of 3 to 10 mm with the ﬁrst day of drug
administration designated as day 0. Peptide-1 was dissolved in
sterile distilled water and administered by subcutaneous
injection at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice weekly for a total of ﬁve
injections. Etoposide was administered at 15 mg/kg. Controls
received the same dose schedule of vehicle. Xenografts were
measured twice weekly by means of calipers and tumor volume
(V) was then calculated by the formula V ¼ p/6  L  W2,
where L is the longest diameter and W the diameter perpendicular to L.
Human SCLC sections and immunohistochemistry
Biopsy specimens were obtained by endobronchial biopsy
from patients attending Papworth Hospital Department of
Thoracic Oncology (Cambridge, United Kingdom) and were
conﬁrmed histologically as SCLC. Parafﬁn-embedded sections
of mouse and human tissue were processed for immunohistochemistry and stained for CD133 and GRP-R followed by
secondary biotinylated species-speciﬁc antibodies (Dako).
Positive staining was visualized using Vectastain Elite RTU
reagent and liquid 3,3 0 -diaminobenzidine. For immunoﬂuorescence staining, species-speciﬁc Alexa-488- or Alexa-594–
conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Invitrogen) and
sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Olympus
FV1000).
HPLC
Mouse S9 liver prep. Livers from female C57BL/6 mice
were homogenized in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L,
pH 7.4) at 4 C to give a ﬁnal homogenate consisting of 25% w/v
tissue. Samples were centrifuged at 9,000  g for 20 minutes at
4 C and the supernatant (S9) was stored on ice. SP-G and
peptide-1 at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 mg/mL were added
and reactions were incubated at 37 C. Aliquots at different time
points were added to 0.2 mL eluting buffer [methanol: 1 mol/L
ammonium acetate (90:10 v/v)]. Cleared supernatants were
frozen at 80 C until analysis by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). HPLC spectra were recorded using
an Agilent 1100 Series coupled to a Polymer Lab 100 ES Evaporative Scattering Detector (ELSD), with a Phenomenex Luna
C18, 5 mm, 10 cm column, using 1 mL/minute of water/acetonitrile/triﬂuoroacetic acid 90:10:0.1, raising to 30:70:0.1 after 8
minutes and detection by UV at 220, 254, 260, 282, and 495 nm.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean  SEM. Signiﬁcance of the
differences between means was assessed using Student t test
or by ANOVA for comparison between groups. When ANOVA
showed a signiﬁcant treatment effect, Dunnet posthoc test was

1556

Cancer Res; 74(5) March 1, 2014

used to compare individual means. Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
Expression of CD133 on SCLC cell lines
SCLC cell lines H345 and H69 expressed the stem cell marker
CD133 (Fig. 1A). Both H345 and H69 cells exhibited a broad
Gaussian distribution staining pattern. A gate set relative to the
isotype control revealed 18.1  2.1% of H345 cells and 23  2.2%
of H69 cells were positive for CD133 expression. Treatment of
H345 and H69 with 30 mg/mL etoposide for 72 hours enriched
the percentage of CD133-expressing cells in both cell lines to 24
 3.4% and to 36  3.1%, respectively (Fig. 1B). CD133 high (top
7%) and low (bottom 7%) were sorted on the basis of CD133-1
ﬂuorescence and the purity of the sorted cells was validated by
ﬂow cytometry using CD133-2 (Fig. 1C and D). In addition,
CD133þ cells demonstrated high CD133 expression as measured by Western blot analysis compared with unsorted and
CD133 cells (Fig. 1E). Sorted CD133þ cells from both H69 and
H345 cells demonstrated higher expression of the stem cell
marker Oct-4 (Fig. 1E), indicating their stem cell–like nature.
H345 and H69 CD133þ and CD133 cells were viable and there
was no signiﬁcant difference in viability following 72 hours
culture (Fig. 1F).
CD133þ cells form colonies in vitro and tumors in vivo
Proliferation of CD133þ and CD133 SCLC cells was examined in cells cultured in serum-free SITA medium. CD133þ cells
were signiﬁcantly more proliferative compared with their
negative counterpart (Fig. 2A). Colony formation in semi solid
media is an in vitro model of tumorigenicity. CD133 cells
failed to form colonies (Fig. 2B), whereas CD133þ cells displayed increased colony formation compared with unsorted
cells (cloning efﬁciency 5.41% and 7.20% in CD133þ compared
with 1.91% and 2.95% in unsorted H345 and H69 cells, respectively, n ¼ 4). We then examined growth of CD133-expressing
cells in vivo. A total of 1  104, 1  105, and 5  105 CD133þ,
CD133, and unsorted H345 cells were injected into the ﬂanks
of nu/nu mice and tumor growth was measured over 55 days.
Consistent with data obtained from colony assay, CD133 cells
failed to grow tumors in nu/nu mice, whereas CD133þ cells
readily formed tumors (Fig. 2C). A total of 1  105 and 5  105
CD133þ cells formed larger tumors than equivalent numbers of
unsorted H345 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating their tumorigenic
potential.
CD133þ cells are resistant to etoposide
Both H345 and H69 SCLC cell lines have been cultured from
patients that had originally undergone a period of chemotherapy and are therefore relatively resistant to etoposide in
culture. Etoposide sensitivity was assessed by MTT assay
following 72 hours treatment (Fig. 3A). Unsorted cells showed
IC50 values for etoposide of 11.5 and 14.1 mg/mL for H345 and
H69 cells, respectively. In both cell lines, the CD133þ population were signiﬁcantly more resistant to etoposide compared
with the CD133 cells (IC50 ¼ 200 vs. 3.5 mg/mL for CD133þ vs.
CD133 H345 cells and 111 vs. 10 mg/mL in CD133þ vs. CD133

In line with the cell viability assay, CD133þ cells demonstrated
reduced etoposide-induced apoptosis compared with CD133
cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S1). Resistance to apoptosis in the positive population was associated with increased
phosphorylation of Akt and increased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Fig. 3C).

CD133þ cells retain CD133 expression in SITA media
but readily differentiate in serum containing media
An essential characteristic of stem cells and CSCs is their
ability to self-renew and differentiate. To examine whether
CD133þ SCLC cells retain such characteristics, we analyzed
the CD133 expression on sorted H345 cells after 21 days
culture in media containing 10% FCS or serum-free SITA
media. CD133þ-sorted cells cultured in SITA medium maintained CD133 expression, whereas CD133þ cells cultured in

FCS containing medium differentiated and generated a

presence of serum, sorted cells cultured in SITA or FCS
containing media for 21 days were analyzed for their colony
forming ability. Figure 3E shows that although culturing in
SITA media maintained the increased colony forming efﬁciency of CD133þ cells, CD133þ cells subsequently cultured
in FCS containing media had lost this high colony forming
ability and showed equal colony formation to unsorted cells.
This would suggest that CD133þ-sorted cells lose their

whether the chemoresistant CD133þ cells expressed increased

shown to be more chemoresistant than the GLC14 cells (26).
We have shown previously that the GLC16 line expresses more
neuropeptide receptors, which correlates with an increased
response to SP-G (22). We therefore sought to examine the
expression of CD133 on the GLC14 (chemosensitive) and
GLC16 (chemoresistant) cells and show that the GLC16 cells
express more CD133, GRP-R, and activated AKT in comparison
to the GLC14 counterpart (Fig. 4E).

patient (Fig. 5A and B). CD133 and GRP-R was expressed in
tumor cells from all patients but the extent of CD133 and GRP-R
expression was markedly increased in the postchemotherapy
samples (Fig. 5A and B). Immunoﬂuorescence staining revealed
that both the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of
staining were increased postchemotherapy (Fig. 5C).
CD133þ cells are more sensitive to a novel substance
P analogue
The substance P analogue SP-G, which underwent a successful phase I clinical trial, was shown to have a short half-life
and poor bioavailability (29, 30) and therefore did not provide a
viable clinical candidate (31). We synthesized and characterized a panel of modiﬁed analogues based on the structure of
SP-G and SP-A (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 32) and tested
their efﬁcacy on SCLC cell viability. One analogue, (peptide-1)
with a D-Leu at position 10 was 3-fold more potent than SP-G in
H345 and H69 SCLC lines in vitro (Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Table S1) and showed increased inhibition of cell growth

(Fig. 6B). Peptide-1 also inhibited Ca2þ mobilization in
response to GRP and AVP in receptor expressing CHO-K1 cells
with potencies of 0.3 and 1.1 mmol/L for GRP-R and V1AR,
respectively (Fig. 6C) and inhibited colony formation in
response to AVP and GRP in H69 and H345 cells, respectively
(Fig. 6D). Peptide-1 was more effective in inducing apoptosis in
both H345 and H69 cells compared with SP-G (Fig. 6E). The
stability of peptide-1 was examined in an in vitro mouse liver
microsome preparation. As described previously, SP-G was
metabolized rapidly by mouse liver (29, 30) with t1/2 ¼ 9.32 
1.37 minutes and was completely metabolized following 30
minutes. Peptide-1 in contrast had a t1/2 ¼ 41.5  2.5 minutes
(n ¼ 4) and was not completely metabolized until after 100
minutes exposure to mouse liver microsomes (Fig. 6F). This
suggests that peptide-1 is approximately four times more
stable than SP-G in vitro.
The novel peptide-1 inhibits SCLC tumor growth in vivo
Peptide-1 was tested in a H345 SCLC xenograft model in vivo.
The peptide was administered twice weekly by subcutaneous
injection at 25 mg/kg for a total of ﬁve injections once tumors

were established and compared with and in combination with
etoposide (15 mg/kg; Fig. 7A). Administration of peptide-1
alone produced a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor volume for the
duration of the study and was as least as efﬁcacious as etoposide alone. A complete tumor response was observed in three
mice receiving peptide-1. Tumor tissue was excised and CD133
immunoﬂuorescence staining showed clusters of CD133expressing cells in the tumors of control mice. The number
of CD133-expressing cells was markedly increased by approximately 3-fold in tumor from mice treated with etoposide (Fig.
7B and C). The increased CD133 staining in the etoposide
group was associated with cells that coexpressed GRP-R.
Confocal microscopic analysis of CD133 (green) and GRP-R
(red) showed colocalization of these markers in human xenografts sections (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, tumors
from mice treated with peptide-1 showed only very few CD133positive cells (Fig. 7B and C). We next examined the effect of
peptide-1 in CD133-sorted cells in vitro. In contrast with
etoposide, CD133þ cells were 3-fold more sensitive to peptide-1 in vitro (Fig. 7D) compared with unsorted cells, whereas
CD133 cells were >4-fold less sensitive. These results show
that chemoresistant CD133-expressing SCLC cells are more
sensitive to substance P analogues and suggest these analogues

www.aacrjournals.org

In this study, we used CD133 to identify a population of
etoposide-resistant human SCLC cells in vitro. We show that
the CD133þ subpopulation was resistant to etoposide and had
augmented proliferative and clonogenic capacity in vitro and
signiﬁcantly increased tumor initiation potential in vivo. These
cells exhibited some stem cell characteristics, including Oct-4
expression, the ability to maintain their stem cell–like characteristics in vitro, and to differentiate into a mixed population
of CD133þ and CD133 cells. We also show that expression of
CD133 increases in mouse and patient samples following
chemotherapy, indicating that new therapeutic strategies are
urgently required for the treatment of patients with SCLC.
Several studies have implicated CD133þ cells as the cause of
cancer chemoresistance (6, 10, 33, 34); however, its role in
colorectal cancer and brain tumors is controversial (35). In
lung cancer, CD133 expression has been associated with poor
prognosis in patients with NSCLC and predicts shorter progression-free survival of patients treated with platinum-based
regimens (6). Although no study has directly evaluated the
relation of CD133 expression with SCLC patient prognosis, in
vitro studies performed on SCLC cells from primary tumors
and cell lines have illustrated the importance of CD133 in
selecting cells with an aggressive, chemoresistant and tumorigenic phenotype (10, 33, 36).
On the basis of the CSC theory, not all the cells within a
neoplasm are clonogenic and tumorigenic and only a rare
fraction of cells with a stem cell–like phenotype propagate
tumor development, metastasis, and treatment resistance (37).
However, the generality of this hypothesis can be questioned as
the frequency of CSCs seems to be highly variable between
cancers of the same type (38). Eramo and colleagues (10)
showed that 0.33% to 22% of lung cancer cells were CSCs. In
our studies, we did not identify a rare discrete subset but rather
showed a Gaussian distribution pattern. Similar diffuse CD133
expression pattern has been observed in various other cancers
(39–41). In addition, CD133 expression has been shown to be
upregulated by the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor
achaete–scute complex homologue 1, which identiﬁes a relatively abundant rather than a small discrete population of cells
with tumor-initiating capacity in SCLC (42), which is in agreement with the present study. Our higher than expected CD133
expression could be a function of the cells having derived
chemoresistance in vivo as both H345 and H69 cells are derived
from postchemotherapy patients. In addition, chemotherapy
can enrich the CSC population (39, 43, 44). In patients with
breast cancer after primary therapy, an increase in the proportion of CSCs was observed (45). However, the fundamental
concept underlying the CSC hypothesis is not associated with
the absolute CSC frequency but is based on the functional
heterogeneity within tumors where a subpopulation of cells
has tumor-initiating capacity, whereas the rest of the tumor
cells are devoid of it. The SCLC cell lines used in this study have
acquired anchorage independence and are propagated as

nonadherent aggregates in liquid culture and therefore show
some characteristics of stem-like cells. However, our extensive
characterization of these cells has shown that not all SCLC cells
are able to form colonies in semi solid agar (5, 46, 47), conﬁrming heterogeneity of cells in the cell line even after extensive passaging in vitro.
Although CSCs are often considered to be slowly proliferating cells based on the assumption that they are derived
from tissue stem cells, their expansion can be controlled by
factors in the microenvironment or "niche." We show that
CD133þ SCLC cells exhibited signiﬁcantly greater proliferation in serum-free medium compared with the CD133
cells, which is in agreement with other studies on hepatocellular carcinoma (39). Contributing factors promoting CSC
growth may be attributed to overexpression of growth
factors by the CSCs. Levina and colleagues (33) demonstrated higher expression of various growth factors in CSCs than
non-CSCs in lung cancer cell lines. SCLC cell lines produce
and secrete various extra cellular matrix proteins and neuropeptides (48–50), which can protect cells from chemotherapy (48, 51, 52), and could contribute to a permissive

1562

environment for CSC expansion. We have shown previously
that the PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively active in SCLC
cells (49) and provides a mechanism whereby SCLC cells
exhibit chemoresistance (48); however, other studies have
suggested that Akt is inducible in SCLC (53). The increased
activation of Akt in CD133þ cells could explain their
increased resistance to etoposide. In SCLC cells and other
cell types, CD133 expression is localized to plasma membrane protrusions and its function may be associated with
plasma membrane remodeling and may effect cell migration
(54) and communication with extracellular matrix proteins
that can inﬂuence resistance to chemotherapy.
The current strategies to target CSCs have focussed primarily on pathways that regulate normal stem cell growth and
differentiation such as the Hedgehog (Hh), Notch, and Wnt
signaling pathways, and there is emerging evidence that targeting these pathways may show some beneﬁt (55). However,
these pathways have not been extensively studied in SCLC. A
previous study has shown that CD133 may be a marker of CSCs
in SCLC (56) and that increased CD133 expression is associated
with chemoresistance and worse clinical outcome in SCLC and

NSCLC (10, 57). As we have previously shown that chemoresistant SCLC cells are more sensitive to neuropeptides, we
examined the hypothesis that CD133þ SCLC cells are also
sensitive and showed increased expression of GRP and V1A
receptors and increased GRP and AVP induced signaling and
growth. Our new analogue peptide-1 inhibited SCLC cell
growth in vitro and in vivo and was more efﬁcacious in
CD133þ cells, extending our previous work and suggesting
that the chemoresistant CD133þ CSC-like cells show increased
neuropeptide responsiveness. We also show even in our small
patient set that in human samples postchemotherapy, there is
increased expression of CD133 and GRP-R, suggesting that the
percentage of CD133-positive cells increases with chemoresistance. This was further corroborated in xenograft studies that
showed clearly deﬁned CD133-negative and -positive tumor
cell populations, with the fraction of CD133þ cells increasing 3fold in etoposide-treated mice that coexpressed GRP-R. In
another approach, we demonstrated that the chemoresistant
GLC16 cell line expressed higher CD133 and GRPR than its
paired chemosensitive GLC14 line. Further prospective studies

www.aacrjournals.org

in pre- and postchemotherapy SCLC samples are required to
explore this interesting ﬁnding in more detail.
Our ﬁnding that GRP-R and V1A receptors and peptide-1
sensitivity increases with resistance to etoposide suggests that
strategies directed at neuropeptide receptors may selectively
target chemoresistant cells. Our new analogue, which has
higher afﬁnity and improved stability, may therefore have
additional beneﬁt as an adjunct to chemotherapy or as a
second-line treatment of resistant disease. We believe that
this property makes them very exciting and novel potential
therapies for chemoresistant SCLC.
