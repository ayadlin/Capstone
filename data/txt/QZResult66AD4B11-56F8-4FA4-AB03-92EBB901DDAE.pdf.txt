BACKGROUND: Excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) are molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or resistance to platinum agents and gemcitabine, respectively. Tailored therapy using these molecular determinants suggested patient benefit in a previously reported phase 2 trial. Here, we
report an individual patient analysis of prospectively accrued patients who were treated with the ‘‘personalized therapy’’ approach versus other ‘‘standard,’’ noncustomized approaches. METHODS: Patients who had nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) with extranodal metastatic disease and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0/1 were accrued to 4 phase 2 clinical trials conducted at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center: Trial A (first-line carboplatin/gemcitabine followed by docetaxel), Trial B (docetaxel and gefitinib in patients aged 70 years), Trial C (combination therapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel/atrasentan), and Trial D (personalized therapy based on ERCC1 and
RRM1 expression). Patients with low RRM1/low ERCC1 expression received gemcitabine/carboplatin, patients with low
RRM1/high ERCC1 expression received gemcitabine/docetaxel, patients with high RRM1/low ERCC1 expression
received docetaxel/carboplatin, and patients with high RRM1/high ERCC1 expression received vinorelbine/docetaxel.
Patients who were treated on Trials A, B, and C were pooled together and analyzed as the ‘‘standard therapy’’ group.
Patients accrued to Trial D were called the ‘‘personalized therapy’’ group. Individual patient data were updated as of
February 8, 2011. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. RESULTS: There were statistically significant improvements between the personalized therapy group versus
the standard therapy group in response (44% vs 22%; P ¼ .002), OS (median: 13.3 months vs 8.9 months; P ¼ .016),
and PFS (median: 7.0 months vs 4.3 months; P ¼ .03). CONCLUSIONS: The results from individual patient analyses
suggest that ERCC1 and RRM1/tailored selection of first-line therapy improved survival over standard treatmentC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
In the United States, there were 212,500 cases of lung
cancer diagnosed in the year 2010, and lung cancer
accounted for >25% of all cancer-related deaths.1 Among
lung cancers, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all newly diagnosed cases.
Approximately 40% of all patients with NSCLC present
with extranodal metastatic disease, for which combination
chemotherapy is considered palliative and produces low
measurable response rates (range, 20%-35%) and rare
complete responses. In these patients, disease progression
is inevitable, and proves to be fatal in the majority of
patients.2-4
In most patients, a doublet chemotherapy regimen
is considered the standard of care for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.2,4 It produces a median overall survival (OS) of 8 to 10 months and a 1-year survival
rate of 31% to 36%. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that adding bevacizumab5 or cetuximab6 to specific chemotherapy doublets improves survival. No single
doublet regimen has emerged as the best choice in terms
of efficacy, although recent trials have indicated that
pemetrexed-cisplatin combinations may be better in nonsquamous NSCLC than gemcitabine-cisplatin. The
reverse is true for squamous cell carcinoma.3 Nevertheless,
the selection of chemotherapy for the majority of patients
remains arbitrary and typically is dictated by the oncologist’s personal preference, convenience of delivery, and
regimen-specific toxicity.
Excision repair cross complementing gene 1
(ERCC1) is a DNA damage repair gene that encodes the 50
endonuclease of the nuclear excision repair complex and
plays an important role in DNA damage repair. Platinum
compounds are heavy metal complexes that form adducts
with, and cross-links between, DNA molecules and, thus,
effectively block DNA replication and transcription. Repair
of these adducts and cross-links are dependent on ERCC1.
The nuclear excision repair complex recognizes and
removes these adducts and, thus, triggers resistance to platinum agents.7 The ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1)
gene is the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase
(RR). RRM1 is also the predominant cellular determinant
of chemotherapeutic efficacy for gemcitabine.8
We previously reported a single-institution, phase 2
trial in patients with advanced NSCLC in which the selection of a chemotherapy doublet was based on tumor
RRM1 expression (determining whether or not gemcitabine was used) and ERCC1 expression (determining

2526

whether or not platinum was used). The outcome of
patients on the trial was encouraging, with improved
responses (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31%59%) and improved median OS (13.3 months; 95% CI,
from 11.5 to <24 months) and progression-free survival
(PFS) (6.6 months; 95% CI, 4.7-8.8 months).9 In the
current report, we demonstrate that the response and survival of patients who received treatment with this personalized approach compared favorably with the response
and survival of patients who received noncustomized (for
the purposes of this report called ‘‘standard’’) treatments
in a prospectively accrued cohort of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients were accrued prospectively to 4 phase 2 clinical
trials conducted at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and
Research Institute (Tampa Fla; National Clinical Trials
[NCT] ClinicalTrials.Gov identifiers NCT00226590,
NCT00231465, and NCT00215930 and 1 study identified as MCC-13303). Patients were eligible for inclusion
in these trials if they had stage IV or stage IIIB NSCLC
with malignant pleural effusions. Patients with brain metastases were included if they had received treatment for
such metastases and were deemed stable. Only patients
with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible.
Staging studies had to include a physical examination, computed tomography studies of the chest and upper
abdomen, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, if clinically indicated.
Patients underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography for staging at the investigator’s discretion
and were previously untreated for advanced disease. The
University of South Florida Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approved all trials included in this report, and all
patients signed an IRB-approved informed consent.
Clinical Trials
In the first trial (Trial A), which enrolled patients between
March 2001 and February 2003 (NCT00226590),
patients received second-line therapy (docetaxel) soon after first-line therapy (carboplatin and gemcitabine) was
concluded.10 In the second-trial (Trial B), which enrolled
only patients aged 70 years between March 2003 and
May 2005 (NCT00231465), a novel combination of a
chemotherapeutic drug (docetaxel) and an oral epidermal
growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (gefitinib) was
tested as first-line therapy.11 In the third trial, between

ERCC1 and RRM1-Tailored Chemotherapy/Simon et al

July 2003 and August 2005 (Trial C), patients were enrolled
in a phase 1/2 trial combining chemotherapy (carboplatin
and paclitaxel) with a novel antiangiogenesis agent (atrasentan;
MCC-13303).12 In these 3 trials, patients were considered eligible for analyses if they received at least 1 cycle of treatment.
For purposes of this analysis, patients enrolled in these studies
were considered to have received ‘‘nonpersonalized’’ therapy
and are grouped together as the ‘‘standard therapy’’ group.
Finally, a single-institution phase 2 trial
(NCT00215930; Trial D) accrued patients between
February 2004 and December 2005 and evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of selecting double-agent chemotherapy based on tumor expression of RRM1 and ERCC1 in
previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC.7
This study required a pretreatment biopsy. Tumoral
ERCC1 and RRM1 expression levels were measured by
real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction, as reported previously; and chemotherapy
was assigned based on the expression of these molecular
determinants.8,13 ERCC1 and RRM1 are known predictors of platinum resistance and gemcitabine resistance,
respectively. In the current study, patients were included
for analyses if they had a biopsy for gene measurements.
Predetermined values for RRM1 and ERCC1 were used to
dichotomize between high versus low expression levels.
ERCC1 and RRM1 values were expressed as unit-less
ratios of the housekeeping gene 18s RNA. If the RRM1
expression level was 16.5, then gemcitabine was used in
the treatment doublet; if the ERCC1 expression level was
8.7, then carboplatin was used in the treatment doublet.
Docetaxel was used if the ERCC1 or RRM1 levels were
high in lieu of carboplatin or gemcitabine, respectively.
These levels were selected based on our previously published experience.8,13 This strategy resulted in 4 possible
gene expression strata with the following doublet therapies:
the low RRM1 and low ERCC1 group received gemcitabine, 1250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, and carboplatin at an
area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of
5 on day 1 every 21 days (the gemcitabine/carboplatin
group); the low RRM1 and high ERCC1 group received
gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel
40 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days (the gemcitabine/
docetaxel group); the high RRM1 and low ERCC1 group
received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and carboplatin at
an AUC of 5 on day 1 every 21 days (the docetaxel/carboplatin group); and the high RRM1 and high ERCC1 group
received vinorelbine 45 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel 60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 every 28 days (the docetaxel/vinorelbine group). Patients enrolled in this study are

considered to have received ‘‘personalized therapy’’ and are
referred to as the ‘‘personalized therapy’’ group.
In the 4 trials described above, disease response was
assessed sequentially after every 2 cycles by computed tomography studies of the chest, upper abdomen, and other
areas as indicated. Other imaging modalities that were used
for disease response assessment included magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain and soft tissues. Patients
without disease progression were continued on therapy for
at least 4 cycles. Patients enrolled on the docetaxel and gefitinib trial received the combination of docetaxel and gefitinib for 4 cycles if there was no progression and then were
maintained with gefitinib alone until they developed disease progression.11 Subsequent clinical management in all
studies was at the discretion of the treating physician.
Follow-up data for OS, DFS, and sites of tumor recurrence were obtained at regular intervals and updated.
We recommended that patients have follow-up visits every 3 months until progression. All patients who were not
being followed routinely at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center were contacted, and their current status was ascertained as of February 8, 2011.
Statistical Methods
OS was calculated from the date of first chemotherapy to
the date of death, and PFS was calculated from date of first
chemotherapy to the date of either recurrence or death,
whichever came first. For patients who remained alive or
progression free, data were censored at the time of the last
follow-up visit.
Baseline characteristics were reported as counts and
percentages dichotomized by the 2 study groups (the personalized therapy group and the standard therapy group).
The Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for 2  2 tables and
the Fisher exact test for 2  3 tables were used to explore
the association of study groups with baseline characteristics.
All outcome analyses were performed according to the
intent-to-treat principle. OS and PFS were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in OS and PFS
between study groups were assessed with 2-sided log-rank
tests. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess
the effect of baseline characteristics, including study group,
on survival. Variables with P values .25 in univariable
analysis were selected for construction of the multivariable
model. A backward elimination procedure was used, and
variables with P values .15 were retained in the model.
All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Between March 2001 and December 2005, 181 patients
were accrued to the 4 clinical trials. A summary of the 4
clinical trials is outlined in Table 1. The salient patient
and disease characteristics of the standard therapy and personalized therapy groups are summarized in Table 2. There

were no statistically significant differences between the 2
groups except for age. More patients aged >70 years were
enrolled in the standard therapy group, because 1 of the
studies (NCT00231465) enrolled only elderly patients
(ie, age 70 years). Patients were treated for 2 cycles
beyond maximal response; then treatment was stopped, and

months]) (Fig. 1A). The effect of age on survival was evaluated carefully, because the standard therapy group had
more patients aged 70 years compared with the personalized therapy group, and this difference was statistically significant (P < .0001). The median OS for patients aged
70 years in the entire study population was 12.1 months
(95% CI, 5.6-16.1 months) compared with 10.3 months
for patient aged <70 years (95% CI, 8.5-12.0 months; P
¼ .897). The median PFS was 5.1 months for the older
age group (95% CI, 2.8-7.0 months) compared with 4.8
months for the younger age group (95% CI, 3.8-6.0
months; P ¼ .398). Thus, the survival of older patients in
this analysis was not inferior to the survival of younger
patients.
Progression-Free Survival
The median PFS was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.7-9.0
months) in the personalized therapy group versus 4.3
months (95% CI, 3.0-5.3 months) in the standard therapy
group (P ¼ .030) (Fig. 1B), although nearly all patients
eventually progressed or died.

patients were observed until they developed disease progression. The median number of cycles delivered in both arms
was 4 cycles.
Response
There was a statistically significant improvement in
response (complete and partial responses) in the personalized therapy group compared with the standard therapy
group (44% vs 22%; P ¼ .002). Achieving a response had
an unambiguous effect on survival; the hazard ratio (HR)
for nonresponse was 1.63 (95% CI, 1.15-2.29) for OS
and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.30-2.54) for PFS.

DISCUSSION
The results from this individual patient analysis suggest
that ERCC1/RRM1-tailored chemotherapy improves survival in patients with advanced NSCLC. Several phase 3
randomized trials currently are underway testing the efficacy of customized chemotherapy versus standard treatment-selection approaches in both adjuvant and advanced
settings.14 Cobo et al15 conducted a randomized trial to
test the hypothesis that ERCC1-tailored therapy would
improve objective responses. Patients were assigned randomly at a 1:2 ratio to either the control arm or the genotypic arm. Patients in the control arm received docetaxel
plus cisplatin. In the genotypic arm, patients with low
ERCC1 levels received docetaxel plus cisplatin, and those
with high levels received docetaxel plus gemcitabine. Of
the 346 patients in that study who were assessable for
response, objective responses were noted in 53 patients
(39.3%) in the control arm and in 107 patients (50.7%)

in the genotypic arm (P ¼ .02). However, there were no
survival differences in the 2 study arms, which the study
was not designed to demonstrate. A phase 3 randomized
trial is currently underway that will test the hypothesis
that ERCC1/RRM1-tailored therapy will improve survival
over the standard chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin
and gemcitabine (NCT00499109).
Another interesting observation is that the OS
curves for personalized and standard therapy separated
out early and remained separate for the entire duration of
the follow-up period (9 years) (Fig. 1A), despite the finding that the PFS curves essentially merged together at the
end of 2 years (Fig. 1B). This leads us to speculate that the
benefits of the 4 cycles of personalized chemotherapy,
usually completed in the first 4 months after diagnosis,
may continue even after the initial therapy has been concluded. We and others have demonstrated previously that
higher expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 predicts for a
more indolent phenotype.13,16,17 Treatment with cisplatin in patients with low ERCC1 expression will induce the
increased expression of ERCC1 that, in turn, will bestow
the surviving tumor with an indolent phenotype. Treatment with gemcitabine will have a similar effect on
patients with low RRM1 expression. Indeed, in our population of patients with stage IV disease, 11.3% of patients
remained alive after 7 years in the personalized therapy
arm compared with 4.5% of patients in the control arm.
To confirm this hypothesis, serial biopsies will need to be
performed in future studies to better understand how the
expression of these and other genes change in response to
treatment.
In conclusion, our data suggest that ERCC1/RRM1tailored selection of first-line therapy improves survival
over standard treatment-selection approaches. The limitations of our analyses are that this was a pooled analyses of
patients accrued to 4 different phase 2 trials. There was
significant overlap between the accrual periods of these 4
trials, with patients accrued between the years 2001 and
2005. Although there was parity between the performance
status and other eligibility criteria across all 4 studies (as
outlined in Table 2), patients in the personalized therapy
group required a second biopsy to enable molecular analyses. This could have led to a cohort of ‘‘more motivated’’
patients enrolling in the personalized therapy group,
potentially introducing a bias in favor of the personalized
therapy group. Hence, the results of this analysis can only
be considered corroboratory but not confirmatory. Confirmation of these data must come from the currently
ongoing randomized phase 3 trials.
