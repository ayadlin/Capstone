Abstract
Vitamin D has broad range of physiological functions and antitumor effects. 24-Hydroxylase, encoded by
the CYP24A1 gene, is the key enzyme for degrading many forms of vitamin D including the most active form,
1,25D3. Inhibition of CYP24A1 enhances 1,25D3 antitumor activity. To isolate regulators of CYP24A1
expression in prostate cancer cells, we established a stable prostate cancer cell line PC3 with CYP24A1
promoter driving luciferase expression to screen a small molecular library for compounds that inhibit
CYP24A1 promoter activity. From this screening, we identiﬁed, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole (TBBz),
a protein kinase CK2 selective inhibitor as a disruptor of CYP24A1 promoter activity. We show that
TBBz inhibits CYP24A1 promoter activity induced by 1,25D3 in prostate cancer cells. In addition, TBBz
downregulates endogenous CYP24A1 mRNA level in TBBz-treated PC3 cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated
CK2 knockdown reduces 1,25D3-induced CYP24A1 mRNA expression in PC3 cells. These results suggest
that CK2 contributes to 1,25D3-mediated target gene expression. Finally, inhibition of CK2 by TBBz or CK2
siRNA signiﬁcantly enhances 1,25D3-mediated antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model.
In summary, our ﬁndings reveal that protein kinase CK2 is involved in the regulation of CYP24A1 expression
by 1,25D3 and CK2 inhibitor enhances 1,25D3-mediated antitumor effect. Cancer Res; 73(7); 2289–97. 2013

Introduction
The most physiologically active form of the prohormone,
vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
(1,25D3). 1,25D3 plays a key role in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism through effects on
tissues such as bone, gut, and kidney (1, 2). Nonclassical
roles for 1,25D3 including the regulation of proliferation,
differentiation, and immune function have now been identiﬁed in a variety of cell types (3). The serum level of 1,25D3
is highly regulated through synthesis facilitated by 1a-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), and through inactivation by 24hydroxylase (1, 2).
CYP24A1 is transcriptionally regulated by the interaction
between the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-retinoid-X-receptor
(RXR) heterodimer and vitamin D response elements (VDREs)
on CYP24A1 gene (4–6). In the absence of 1,25D3, VDR/RXR

heterodimers bind to these VDREs and repress transcription
through interactions with a corepressor complex that has
histone deacetylase activity (7). In the presence of 1,25D3, the
corepressor complex is released, permitting the recruitment of
a coactivator complex that leads to the activation of the gene
(8, 9). 1,25D3 also stimulates rapid nongenomic effects in some
cell types via the ERK1/ERK2/ERK5, PKC, or JNK MAP kinase
modules through a cell membrane–associated VDR (3).
High CYP24A1 expression level is a common feature of
several solid tumors (3, 10–15) and is associated with poorer
prognosis (10, 14, 16). The increased intratumoral levels of
CYP24A1 would lead to rapid degradation of 1,25D3, thus
limiting the amount of 1,25D3 locally in the tumor cells and
abrogating the antiproliferative or prodifferentiation effects
of 1,25D3 (10, 16, 17). Inhibition of CYP24A1 is expected to
slow the catabolism of 1,25D3, thereby enhancing the antiproliferative effect of 1,25D3 (18–21). Administration of
1,25D3 in combination with a CYP24A1 inhibitor enhances
the antitumor activity of 1,25D3 (19, 22). However, most of
the current CYP24A1 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, are
relatively nonspeciﬁc, and strikingly increase the CYP24A1
expression level compared with cells treated with 1,25D3
alone (19).
In this study, we screened a small molecule library to identify
novel CYP24A1 inhibitors using a CYP24A1 promoter–driving
luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, we expected that the
new CYP24A1 inhibitor would enhance 1,25D3-mediated function by inhibiting CYP24A1 expression.

CK2 Inhibitor Enhances Vitamin D–Mediated Antitumor Effects

Results
Screening of small molecules from LOPAC1280 Library by
CYP24A1 promoter driving reporter assay
A stable human prostate cancer PC3 cell line expressing
CYP24A1 promoter–driving luciferase reporter was generated
by transfection using lipofectamine 2000 followed by puromycin selection. Screening of the LOPAC1280 library in this system
resulted in the identiﬁcation of 70 hits, each of which had over
50% inhibition of 1,25D3-induced CYP24A1 promoter activity
(Fig. 1A). Excluding the hits with high toxicity, known from
SMSC database, 21 selected molecules were subjected to
secondary dose–response experiments to conﬁrm initial
observations. Seventeen hits reduced 1,25D3-mediated
CYP24A1 promoter activation (Fig. 1B). Among them, 4,5,6,7TBBz displayed the strongest inhibitory effect and was chosen
for further investigation (Fig. 1A and B).
Repression of CYP24A1 transcriptional activity by TBBz
To conﬁrm the results from the screening, we examined
the effect of various concentration of TBBz on CYP24A1

promoter activity in PC3/CYP24A1 cells. Results showed that
TBBz inhibited CYP24A1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). We also tested the effect of TBBz on
endogenous and 1,25D3-regulated CYP24A1 expression. PC3
cells were treated with 1 or 5 mmol/L of TBBz alone or
followed by 10, 30, and 100 nmol/L of 1,25D3. qRT-PCR
results showed that PC3 cells displayed low endogenous
CYP24A1 mRNA level and dose-dependent induction of
CYP24A1 mRNA expression by 1,25D3 (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). TBBz signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) reduced 1,25D3-induced
CYP24A1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1D). Less induction of CYP24A1 expression by lower
dose of 1,25D3 was relatively less inﬂuenced by TBBz (Supplementary Fig. S1A). These results indicate that TBBz
inhibits endogenous and 1,25D3-induced CYP24A1 expression at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, we observed
that 25D3, the precursor to 1,25D3 also induced CYP24A1
mRNA expression in PC3 cells and TBBz inhibits 25D3
-induced CYP24A1 expression at the transcriptional level in
PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A).

measured. Each dot represents the value of luminescence. B, excluding the hits with high toxicity, known from SMSC database, 21 selected compounds were
subjected to secondary dose–response experiments to conﬁrm initial observations. PC3/CYP24A1 cells were treated with compounds at indicated
concentration followed by 1,25D3. CYP24A1 promoter luciferase activity was measured and fold change of luciferase value was calculated for the ratio
of 1,25D3-induced luciferase activity in the presence of the compound to 1,25D3-induced luciferase activity in the absence of the compound. C, PC3
cells were transfected with the CYP24A1 promoter constructs along with Renilla luciferase control construct. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were
treated with TBBz as indicated and 1,25D3 (100 nmol/L) for additional 24 hours and harvested, and luciferase activities were measured using the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. The experiment was repeated twice to conﬁrm the reproducibility of results ( P < 0.05). D, PC3 cells were treated with
TBBz as indicated followed by 1,25D3 (100 nmol/L). Expression of CYP24A1 mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR and normalized to human GAPDH and all
samples were analyzed in triplicate.

Reduction of CYP24A1 expression by siRNA-CK2
TBBz is a selective protein kinase CK2 inhibitor (26). To
investigate whether CK2 plays a role in the regulation of
CYP24A1 expression, siRNA-CK2 was transfected in prostate
cancer PC3 or DU145 cells for 72 hours followed by the
addition of 1,25D3. CYP24A1 mRNA and CYP24A1 protein
were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.
Results showed that PC3 and DU145 cells express CK2 and
CK2 was effectively knocked down by siRNA-CK2 in PC3 and
DU145 cells compared with control siRNA (Fig. 2A and B).
1,25D3 signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) increased CYP24A1 expression
in PC3 cells, which express a low level of endogenous
CYP24A1 (Fig. 2A and C, respectively), and in DU145 cells,
which display a high level of endogenous CYP24A1 (Fig. 2B
and D, respectively). Transfection with siRNA-CK2 signiﬁcantly reduced 1,25D3-induced CYP24A1 expression at both
mRNA and protein level in PC3 (Fig. 2A and C) and DU145
cells (Fig. 2B and D) as compared with the mock-transfected
or siRNA control transfected samples. These results indicate
that CK2 plays a role in regulation of 1,25D3-induced
CYP24A1 expression.
Differential effects of siRNA-CK2 on 1,25D3-induced
TYPV6, p21Waf1, and GADD45A mRNA expression
To investigate whether silencing of CK2 affects the expression of other vitamin D target genes, TRPV6, p21Waf1, and
GADD45A mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR in
CK2 knockdown PC3 cells. 1,25D3 induced TRPV6, p21Waf1, and
GADD45A mRNA expression. siRNA-CK2 signiﬁcantly (P <
0.01) reduced 1,25D3-induced TRPV6 mRNA expression as
compared with the mock-transfected or siRNA control transfected cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, knockdown of CK2 markedly
increased p21Waf1 and slightly increased GADD45A mRNA

expression (Fig. 3B and C). These results indicate that silencing
of CK2 differentially affects the expression of vitamin D target
genes.
Correlation of increased CYP24A1 expression with
increased CK2 expression in human prostate tumors
We analyzed mRNA expression of CYP24A1 and CK2 in 30
matched pair of human normal and tumor prostate samples by
qRT-PCR. CK2 expression was signiﬁcantly increased in prostate tumor lesions compared with normal lesions (P ¼
0.0224; Fig. 4). There was no correlation of the level of CYP24A1
expression and CK2 expression with Gleason Score. To determine whether tumor samples with increased CYP24A1 expression correlated with increased CK2 expression compared with
normal samples, we built a 2  2 contingency table by dividing
the 30 samples based on the CYP24A1 expression change (1.5
fold up vs. other) and CK2 expression change (1.5 fold up vs.
other). Seven samples display increased CYP24A1 expression in
a total of 30 prostate tumors compared with matched normal
prostate samples. Four of the 7 samples with increased
CYP24A1 expression have increased CK2 expression. However,
among the remaining 23 samples with low CYP24A1 expression, only 3 samples have high CK2 expression (Table 1). Fisher
exact test shows that increased CYP24A1 expression is
signiﬁcantly associated with increased CK2 expression in
tumor (P ¼ 0.0331). These data indicate that CK2 may be
involved in regulation of increased CYP24A1 expression in
prostate cancer.

CK2 Inhibitor Enhances Vitamin D–Mediated Antitumor Effects

1,25D3 alone (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Instead of 1,25D3,
25D3 in combination of TBBz also caused a greater inhibition
of proliferation in PC3 cells than when treated with either
agent alone (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
To more speciﬁcally investigate the importance of CK2 in
1,25D3 antiproliferative effect, siRNA-CK2 was employed.
siRNA-CK2 signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) enhanced 1,25D3 antiproliferative effect in PC3 cells (Fig. 5B). This indicates that CK2
inhibition is antiproliferative and enhances 1,25D3 antiproliferative effect.
Enhancement of 1,25D3 antitumor activity by TBBz in
vivo
Having showed the efﬁcacy of the combination treatment of
1,25D3 and TBBz in vitro, we next assessed both toxicity and
efﬁcacy of the combination treatment in a PC3 prostate tumor
xenograft mouse model. We observed a marked inhibition of
tumor growth by the combination of 1,25D3 and TBBz, compared with 1,25D3 or TBBz alone (Fig. 6A). Mice grew normally
without suffering from weight loss at a dose sufﬁcient to induce
antitumor effect (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that CK2
inhibitor TBBz enhances 1,25D3 antitumor activity in vivo.
Effect of the combination of 1,25D3 and TBBz on tumor
cell CYP24A1 expression, proliferation, and apoptosis in
in vivo
To investigate the effect of TBBz on CYP24A1 expression
in vivo, tumor tissues were harvested at the end of the
treatment as described in Fig. 5A, and CYP24A1 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR. 1,25D3 increased
CYP24A1 expression and TBBz reduced CYP24A1 expression
in tumors as compared with saline group (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, TBBz signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) reduced 1,25D3-induced
CYP24A1 expression (Fig. 6C). These observations were
consistent with the results obtained in the in vitro study.
To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms for the
antitumor activity of 1,25D3 and TBBz in vivo, we examined

was examined using the Trypan blue exclusion assay after
treatment with 1,25D3, TBBz, or the combination of 1,25D3 and

resulted in a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) enhancement of 1,25D3
antiproliferative effect in PC3 cells (Fig. 5A). We also measured
CYP24A1 mRNA expression on day 1 and 9. We observed that
CYP24A1 mRNA expression kept lower in PC3 cells treated with
the combination of 1,25D3 and TBBz, which showed the most
antiproliferative activity compared with cells treated with

the proliferation marker Ki-67 and apoptosis marker cleaved
caspase-3 as well as in situ DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) in
tumor tissues (Fig. 6D). The results showed that saline-treated
tumor tissue had strong Ki-67 staining, 1,25D3 or TBBz reduced
Ki-67 staining (Fig. 6D). The combination of 1,25D3 and TBBz
further reduced Ki-67 staining (Fig. 6D). We also observed that
saline group did not have positive cleaved caspase-3 staining,
whereas 1,25D3 or TBBz treatment alone induced caspase-3
cleavage in the tumor tissue (Fig. 6D). The combination of
1,25D3 and TBBz further enhanced caspase-3 cleavage (Fig.
6D). The effect of 1,25D3 and TBBz on apoptosis was further
conﬁrmed by TUNEL assay (Fig. 6D). These results clearly
indicate the potential usefulness of the combination of 1,25D3
and CK2 inhibitors in prostate cancer therapy.

Discussion
The majority of CYP24A1 inhibitors developed so far target
the enzyme activity. However, decreased enzyme activity
with current CYP24A1 inhibitors is often associated with
increased enzyme expression, which negatively impacts on
the vitamin D–mediated antitumor activity (19, 21, 27). In
this study, the strategy we utilized to identify new CYP24A1
inhibitors differs from previously described (28). We established a stable PC3 cell line, which express luciferase driven
by CYP24A1 promoter, to screen a small molecular library
containing 1,280 compounds. We identiﬁed 17 new CYP24A1
inhibitors, TBBz being the strongest was selected for
further characterization, which revealed a new CYP24A1
expression–regulating molecule, protein kinase CK2.
Analysis of 30 paired normal and tumor human prostate
samples showed that increased CYP24A1 expression is related to increased CK2 expression in tumor. Moreover, we
observed a signiﬁcant enhancement of 1,25D3 antitumor
activity by inhibiting CK2 in vitro or in vivo. The effects
were associated with the reduction of CYP24A1 expression,
inhibition of proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis in
tumors.
Protein kinase CK2 is an evolutionarily conserved serine/
threonine kinase, which is ubiquitously expressed in human
tissues. CK2 is located both in cytosol and nucleus (29, 30).
Overexpression of CK2 has been noted in a variety of
human cancers including prostate cancer and correlates
with a poor clinical outcome (31–34). Inhibition of CK2
activity reduced cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells
(35, 36). The role for CK2 in the regulation of CYP24A1 gene

study shows that CK2 positively regulates CYP24A1 expression. We further show that CK2 expression was higher in
tumor lesions compared with normal lesions (P ¼ 0.0224;
Fig. 4). Increase of CK2 expression was signiﬁcantly (P ¼
0.0331) associated with increased CYP24A1 expression in
these prostate tumor samples. These observations suggest
that CK2 may serve as a mechanism for controlling
CYP24A1 expression in human cancers, and therefore supporting the use of CK2 inhibitors for cancer treatment in
combination with 1,25D3.
CYP24A1 expression is heterogeneous in prostate cancer
(23). It is noteworthy that 3 human prostate tumor samples
with high CK2 expression did not express high level of
CYP24A1 and 3 prostate tumor samples with high CYP24A1
expression did not express high level of CK2 compared with
normal lesions (table 1). These data suggest that the level of
CK2 expression does not entirely account for the level of
CYP24A1 expression in human prostate tumor. Previous
studies indicated multiple events are associated with
CYP24A1 expression in cancer, such as methylation and

CK2 Inhibitor Enhances Vitamin D–Mediated Antitumor Effects

Figure 6. TBBz enhances 1,25D3
antitumor effect in PC3 xenograft
mouse model. PC3 prostate
cancer cells were inoculated
subcutaneously into the right ﬂank of
male SCID mice. When the tumors
were palpable, animals were treated
intraperitoneally with saline, 1,25D3,
TBBz, or the combinations of 1,25D3
and TBBz as described in Materials
and Methods. A, tumor growth was
monitored by measuring tumor size 3
times per week. Tumor volumes were
calculated by (length  width2)/2
( , P < 0.01). B, mouse weight was
measured 3 times per week. C, PC3
tumors were harvested after the
treatment, and CYP24A1 mRNA
expression in tumor tissues was
determined by qRT-PCR.
D, PC3 tumors were harvested
after the treatment, and
immunohistochemical staining
of Ki-67 and cleaved Caspase-3 in
tissues was conducted. Nuclear DNA
fragmentation in situ was detected
using TACS-XL In Situ Apoptosis
Detection Kit in tumor tissues (200).

histone modiﬁcation associated with the CYP24A1 promoter
(3, 23, 37), ampliﬁcation at the CYP24A1 locus (13) and
miRNA regulation (38).
We also observed that the silencing of CK2 differentially
affects vitamin D target genes. We observed the signiﬁcant
reduction of 1,25D3-induced TRPV6 in siRNA-CK2 transfected PC3 cells. Upregulation of TRPV6 by 1,25D3 in prostate
cancer cells is considered to be proproliferative by increasing Ca2þ uptake (39, 40). However, siRNA-CK2 enhanced
1,25D3-mediated induction of p21Waf1 and GADD45A. p21Waf1
is accounted in part for the antiproliferative effects of VDR
ligands on some cell types, such as prostate cancer (19, 41–
43). GADD45A is identiﬁed as a primary target gene for
1,25D3 in ovarian, testicular, and prostate cancer cells
(19, 44, 45). The increase in GADD45A expression leads to
a decrease of cyclin B and induces G2/M cell-cycle arrest (45,
46). In this study, the reduction of CYP24A1 and TRPV6
expression and the increase in the p21waf1 and GADD45A
expression by the combination of 1,25D3 and siRNA-CK2

may be reﬂective of the cooperative growth inhibition
observed from the cell-proliferation assay.
However, the exact mechanisms underlying the effect of CK2
on 1,25D3-mediated CYP24A1 induction remain unclear
despite reports of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of puriﬁed
VDR at serine208 and VDRE construct transactivation in COS-7
kidney cells cotransfected with VDR and CK2 (47–49). Studies
have shown that phosphorylation of hVDR at serine208 does not
affect the ability of VDR to bind to DNA and is not obligatory for
1,25D3 action, but may contribute to the modulation of the
afﬁnity of VDR for the vitamin D interacting protein complex,
therefore increasing its ability to transactivate target promoters (50). At present, we cannot rule out additional mechanisms
in the interaction between CK2 and vitamin D target genes
as differential effect was observed on TRPV6, p21Waf1, and
GADD45A.
In summary, we developed a new strategy to identify novel
CYP24A1 inhibitors. Furthermore, we found that protein kinase
CK2 is involved in the regulation of CYP24A1 and other vitamin
