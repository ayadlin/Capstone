Acquired resistance to endocrine therapies has severely limited their long-term
effectiveness in breast cancer. In recent years a clear rationale has developed for
combining signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) with endocrine therapies to delay
the emergence of acquired resistance and enhance endocrine responsiveness. A
variety of biologic agents have been developed to target key proteins along the
EGFR, HER2, MAPK, and P13K/Akt signal transduction cascades. While several of
these agents have shown early promise in selected breast cancer models, translating these data into convincing clinical results has been generally disappointing
to date. By applying more rigorous trial design and tumor selection criteria to
future trials, it is much more likely that adding the new generation of targeted
therapies can fulfill its promise in enhancing endocrine responsiveness and our
ability to treat breast cancer patients. Cancer 2008;112(3 suppl):710–7.  2007

n recent years a clear rationale has developed for combining signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) with endocrine therapies for the
purposes of enhancing endocrine responsiveness and delaying the
emergence of acquired resistance. Acquired resistance may be due
to several factors, including crosstalk between peptide growth factor
pathways and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling; overexpression of
transmembrane peptide growth factor receptors such as epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) or HER21,2; and activation of downstream intracellular signaling via the Ras-Raf mitogenic-activated

protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.3–5 Growth
factor-dependent activation of MAPK/PI3K/Akt pathways and their downstream effectors act to phosphorylate ERa and its coactivators (eg, A1B1), leading to
ligand-independent transcription of ER responsive
genes.6,7 Over time, ER signaling becomes more dependent on these alternate growth factor signaling
pathways, allowing cells to escape the antiproliferative effects of endocrine therapy.
A variety of biologic agents have been developed
to target key proteins along these signal transduction
cascades with the aim of blocking tumor cell access
to pathways that facilitate resistance to hormone
therapy, including monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In many instances,
preclinical experiments using ER-positive (ER1) endocrine-resistant breast cancer have appeared convincing in selected breast cancer models. However,
translating these promising data into convincing
clinical results may be limited by the heterogeneous
nature of breast cancer in patients, our lack of
understanding about the biology of individual
tumors at the time of relapse, and lack of adequately
designed/powered clinical trials with appropriate
selection criteria. As discussed below, failure to
appreciate these principles may prove to be the
Achilles heel for this promising approach.

ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE: ROLE OF ER WITH OTHER
SIGNALING PATHWAYS?
There is much evidence that ER signaling continues
to play an important part in the proliferation of
breast cancer even after the development of endocrine resistance. In over 50% of cases, biopsies taken
from breast cancer patients who have relapsed on tamoxifen show retention of a functional ER.8 In addition, recurrent breast cancer that has become
refractory to tamoxifen can respond to further endocrine manipulation with an aromatase inhibitor or
an ER down-regulator such as fulvestrant.9 In the
laboratory, ER1 breast cancer cells that become resistant to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED)
remain ER1, adapting to estrogen deprivation by
becoming hypersensitive to estradiol levels as low as
10212 M.10,11 Transcription of ER-regulated genes is
enhanced in this setting with an associated increase
in peptide growth factor activity that ‘crosstalks’ with
ER signaling.6,7 While fewer data exist on tumor ER
expression in patients with resistance to aromatase
inhibitors, modest clinical activity has been reported
for both exemestane and fulvestrant in this setting,12
suggesting that functional ER signaling remains in
many cases.

711

While functional ER may be retained in many
tumors with acquired endocrine resistance, ER is lost
in 40% to 50% tumors at the time of progression on
hormonal therapy.13,14 The mechanisms for ER loss
are varied, but can include epigenetic silencing of ER
via methylation of CpG islands in the ER-alpha gene
promoter region.15 Experiments have shown that
inhibitors of DNA methylation (ie, 5-azacytidine or
5-aza20 -deoxycytidine) can result in reexpression of
the ER gene.16 In addition, experimental data from
EGFR or HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines
suggest that hyperactivation of downstream MAPK
represses ER-alpha expression, and that repression is
reversible using the MEK inhibitors PD098059 or
UO126.17 More recently, serial repeat biopsies from a
small clinical study in 10 patients with ER-negative
HER2-positive advanced breast cancer treated with
trastuzumab demonstrated reexpression of ER in 3
patients between 2 months to 6 months after initiation of treatment. At least 1 patient was subsequently
successfully treated with letrozole.18 Thus, ER loss in
previous ER1 breast cancer may be a reversible phenomenon as a consequence of using appropriate
STIs.
Given the evidence that the ER can remain functional and interact with growth factor signaling pathways, or that if ER expression is lost subsequent
reexpression may be feasible, a strong clinical rationale exists for combining novel STIs with endocrine
therapy rather than using either alone. Several clinical trials have been initiated, but the results to date
have been generally disappointing. Some of the reasons for failure with each of the various STIs are
highlighted below.

ENDOCRINE THERAPY COMBINED WITH
EGFR INHIBITORS
Gefitinib and erlotinib are both small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the ATP binding site of the
EGFR and have been shown to delay the development of tamoxifen resistance in vitro.19 Two studies
have explored the potential benefit for combining either gefitinib or erlotinib with an aromatase inhibitor
(Table 1). Neither study showed significant clinical
efficacy, and in the absence of a randomized design
and/or preselection for known EGFR overexpression
or activating mutations, concern might be expressed
as to whether a phase 2 design can provide answers.
However, if phase 2 combination studies do suggest
a high clinical response rate, then randomized phase
3 studies would seem appropriate.
More definitive answers to the question of combined EGFR inhibition with endocrine therapy might

be obtained by studying homogenous tumor populations in the early (primary) breast cancer setting.
However, a randomized neoadjuvant trial of anastrozole alone or in combination with gefitinib given for
3 months before surgery in 120 postmenopausal
patients with ER1 primary breast cancer was also
negative (Table 1).22 That study also failed to select
patients for EGFR overexpression, although molecu-

lar studies of tumor specimens obtained pre- and
posttreatment will be crucial to explain response/resistance to both therapies. In contrast, a preoperative
trial of gefitinib versus gefitinib combined with anastrozole for 4 to 6 weeks before surgery was conducted in women with known ER1 and EGFR1
primary breast cancer. That study showed that both
treatments effectively reduced the size of breast

Targeted Therapies Endocrine Resistance/Johnston et al.

tumors and levels of ER phosphorylation, and that
combined treatment induced the greatest reduction
in tumor proliferation.23
These 4 studies illustrate the importance of
selecting tumors with the known target for combined
STI endocrine therapy, although the reported rates
for EGFR expression in primary breast cancer do
vary quite dramatically among studies (range, 15%–
90%).24,25 Reasons for this wide range in expression
relate to differences in methodology for measuring
the EGFR target in human tumors, including different antibodies, varied fixation and antigen retrieval
methodologies, and nonstandardized scoring systems
for EGFR expression. As such, it is difficult to agree
what constitutes true EGFR overexpression for inclusion in clinical trials of EGFR targeted therapies,
resulting in studies with heterogeneous groups of
tumors with varied levels of EGFR, which in turn
diminishes the likelihood of a positive trial.
Conducting studies that lack tumor selection by
demonstration of the EGFR target as an obligate
entry criteria have prevented us from seeing the true
benefit of gefitinib in breast cancer. This is in stark
contrast to the situation for HER2, where standardization of measuring the target has yielded significant
results for trastuzumab (see below). Nevertheless,
several trials with unselected patients are investigating the combination of gefitinib with endocrine
therapies, and the results of a phase 3 study of firstline tamoxifen with/without gefitinib in metastatic
breast cancer are expected soon. The sole driving rationale for this approach is preclinical modeling,
including recent reports that complete dual blockade
of ER and EGFR with fulvestrant and gefitinib produced substantially greater tumor control than either
approach alone.26 This has caused some investigators
to continue to hold high expectations that the preclinical rationale will deliver significant efficacy
improvements in these trials.

ENDOCRINE THERAPY COMBINED
WITH TRASTUZUMAB
ER1 tumors that coexpress HER2 are increasingly
recognized as having the potential for de novo endocrine resistance, especially to tamoxifen. Likewise, as
discussed above, HER2 signaling may repress expression of ER directly via hyperactivated MAPK,17 and
clinical evidence exists that the monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab may restore both ER expression and endocrine responsiveness in advanced breast cancer.18
A phase 2 clinical trial of letrozole and trastuzumab
in patients with ER1/HER21 metastatic breast cancer revealed that the combination was well tolerated

713

and had a clinical benefit rate (partial response [PR]
plus stable disease [SD]) of 50%27 (Table 1). In the
absence of a randomized design it is difficult to draw
robust conclusions regarding the true added benefit
of letrozole over trastuzumab alone.28 However, a
randomized phase 2 trial in 207 patients with known
ER1/HER21 metastatic breast cancer recently
reported a doubling of progression-free survival with
the addition of trastuzumab over anastrozole alone
(4.8 months vs 2.4 months, P 5 .0016).29 Ongoing
studies are looking at trastuzumab in combination
with aromatase inhibitors, although a 3-arm randomized trial of trastuzumab, an aromatase inhibitor,
and the combination is required to confirm whether
the combination actually offers an additive benefit.

ENDOCRINE THERAPY COMBINED WITH THE DUAL
EGFR/HER2 INHIBITOR LAPATINIB
Lapatinib is a potent oral TKI of both EGFR and
HER2. As a dual inhibitor it may have the potential
for greater antitumor effect than strategies targeting
a single receptor, and in vitro data have demonstrated that estrogen deprivation significantly
enhances the antiproliferative effects of lapatinib in
HER2-amplified breast cancer cell lines.30,31 A phase
1 study has shown that the combination of lapatinib
with letrozole was well tolerated, with toxicities consisting mainly of grade 1–2 diarrhea, nausea, rash,
and fatigue.32 A small phase 2 trial of lapatinib and
tamoxifen was designed on the basis of preclinical
evidence that lapatinib can significantly enhance
sensitivity to tamoxifen in cell lines with acquired tamoxifen resistance.31,33 A phase 3 trial has completed
recruitment of 1200 patients with metastatic ER1
breast cancer who were randomized to receive either
letrozole alone or letrozole combined with lapatinib.
Importantly, patients were selected regardless of their
known EGFR/HER2 status in the primary tumor, but
were stratified according to the time interval since
adjuvant tamoxifen (> or <6 months). This large
study may offer an important insight into the subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from a lapatinib-endocrine combination, such as known
HER21/ER1 breast cancer with potential de novo
endocrine resistance (at least 200 such patients
should be included in the study) or tumors that
might develop acquired resistance to letrozole during
treatment because of adaptive HER2 up-regulation.
To identify the latter, all patients had serum taken at
baseline entry for assessment of circulating extracellular domain (ECD) HER2, which has been reported
to be a predictor of poorer outcome with endocrine
therapy, with seroconversion occurring during endo-

714

crine therapy in up to 25% of patients with ER1
metastatic disease treated with either letrozole or tamoxifen.34 Thus, correlative biomarker studies will
be crucial to the interpretation of which ER1 tumors
derive benefit from combined STI-endocrine therapy.

ENDOCRINE THERAPY COMBINED WITH
FARNESYLTRANSFERASE INHIBITORS (FTIS)
Interfering with the downstream effectors of growth
factor receptors has emerged as another effective
antitumor strategy. Ras proteins are membranebound GTP-binding proteins that are frequently
aberrantly expressed in breast cancer35 and act as
mitogenic switches between growth factors receptors
and downstream intracellular signaling via Raf/
MAPK. This reaction is catalyzed by the farnesyltransferase enzyme. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors
(FTIs) such as tipifarnib and lonafarnib were developed in an effort to interrupt this pathway by inhibiting farnesylation, the first step in Ras activation. On
the basis of encouraging results in cell line and tumor xenograft models,5,36 trials have been conducted
in combination with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (Table 1). Again, small phase 1/2 studies that
included patients with endocrine resistance suggested evidence of efficacy.37,38 Unfortunately, a
larger randomized phase 2 study of letrozole alone or
in combination with tipifarnib failed to show added
benefit for the combination (Table 1).39 Mistakes in
this trial included underpowering with inappropriate
clinical endpoints of response rate rather than disease stabilization. However, the true target for FTIs
remains poorly understood, with up to 30 proteins
that require farnesylation having a role in cellular
growth and survival.40

COMBINATION WITH INHIBITORS OF THE
MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (MTOR)
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated by several
growth factors including insulin, insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), EGF, and vascular epidermal growth factor
(VEGF). Inhibiting this key effector of multiple prosurvival signals has therefore emerged as a viable
therapeutic strategy in cancer. Mutations in the catalytic domain of PI3K have been identified in 20% to
25% of breast cancers.41,42 A further 15% to 35% of
breast cancer patients demonstrate reduced expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on
chromosome 10 (PTEN), a known inhibitor of the
PI3K/AKT pathway that may be associated with poor
prognosis in patients with ER1 breast cancer treated
with tamoxifen.43,44 Therefore, these cancers may be

resistant to strategies targeting upstream growth factor receptors, but particularly sensitive to PI3K or
mTOR inhibition. Furthermore, preclinical studies
have demonstrated that the combination of letrozole
with an mTOR inhibitor results in synergistic growth
inhibition and apoptosis in ER1 breast cancer cell
models.45
While PI3K inhibitors are still in the early stages
of development, mTOR inhibitors have been tested
in breast cancer in combination with endocrine
therapies (Table 1). A randomized phase 2 study of
letrozole alone or in combination with another inhibitor, temsirolimus, has also been reported.47 Preliminary results suggested a modest benefit to the
combination in terms of median progression-free
survival (13.2 months vs 11.6 months). Unfortunately,
the resulting large phase 3 randomized trial of letrozole alone or in combination with temsirolimus in
992 postmenopausal women was terminated early after an interim analysis demonstrated a lack of benefit
for the combination.48 As with gefitinib, the inability
to identify patients in whom the tumors demonstrate
dependence on PI3K-mTOR activation severely limited the likelihood of success for this large phase 3
trial. The problem remains knowing which protein to
measure as a true indicator of activation of mTOR.
Likewise, concern has been expressed that mTOR inhibition may induce a feedback loop via S6 kinase
and IGFR, which enhances further Akt activation,
thus overcoming the effects of mTOR inhibition. Further studies in the neoadjuvant setting are evaluating
the benefit of adding the mTOR inhibitor everolimus
(RAD-001) to letrozole.

CONCLUSIONS FROM CURRENT TRIALS
A huge number of endocrine/targeted combinations
are currently being tested in the clinic, largely based
on preclinical data suggesting that this approach may
enhance endocrine responsiveness and offer true promise for women with ER1 breast cancer. Having a
strong scientific rationale is a clear prerequisite to this
strategy, and supportive preclinical evidence exists for
many of the examples above. However, careful consideration needs to be given to the design of appropriate
clinical trials to ensure that they can clearly demonstrate added benefit for these novel and expensive
therapies. Identifying effective combinations of agents,
schedules, doses, and tumor profiles is already proving to be a significant challenge.
It is clear that from the negative clinical trials
reported to date that STI-endocrine combinations
are unlikely to be effective in an unselected population. Therefore, more effort needs to be made to
identify subsets of tumors that are dependent on the

Targeted Therapies Endocrine Resistance/Johnston et al.

pathways targeted by these novel drugs. In particular,
identifying the target in human tumors with an easily
reproducible and standardized assay is central to
success in the clinical development of STIs. However,
the use and accessibility of fresh biopsies in
advanced disease to select patients for phase 2/3
trials is often difficult in clinical practice, limiting
enrolment in many of these studies.
Given the relatively favorable toxicity profiles for
many of these drugs, phase 1/2 combination studies
of endocrine therapy with novel agents should be
undertaken with the aim of identifying the biologically effective dose as defined by demonstrated target
inhibition rather than the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD). For these studies to be feasible, the development of biomarkers as pharmacodynamic endpoints
is crucial, as alternative endpoints to objective
response will be needed.
In summary, there remains a need for appropriate
trial design to answer the relevant question posed by
the addition of the new targeted therapy (ie, does it
enhance tumor response, or instead delay resistance
and prolong time to progression). In addition, appropriate selection of patients must occur for these trials
based on identification in standardized assays of the
relevant target within the tumor. If these 2 principles
are adhered to, then it is much more likely that adding the new generation of targeted therapies may fulfill
their
promise
in
enhancing
endocrine
responsiveness and our ability to improve treatment
for breast cancer patients in the future.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below come from the
oral presentation given at the Sixth Cambridge Conference on Endocrine and Targeted Manipulation of
Breast Cancer and do not correspond directly to the
written article, which is a more general review.
Dr. Paul Goss: The endocrine pathway is the key
to this disease, and that’s why the animal and laboratory models hold up to some extent. And that’s why
the clinical trial designs switch the patients from 1
endocrine therapy to another. If there’s progression
on an endocrine therapy, you try a different endocrine therapy. To some extent, that’s worked because
you’re still manipulating the major pathway. The problem when you get into these subsidiary pathways is
that the responders all look the same, but the nonresponders all look different. You can’t use clinical progression on a big blockbuster therapy like an
endocrine pathway and then say we can now use
that to test 1 of 200 possible nodal points of resistance. You’re going to get a negative trial every time.

715

You’re going to get 3 of 100 patients responding
because they have the target and the other 97 don’t.
You’re going to keep repeating negative trial after negative trial until you find the specific target. When
these patients progress on letrozole, I predict that
we’ll find 10, 20, 30, or 40 mechanisms of progression.
Dr. Stephen Johnston: The issue, in terms of
developing any of these drugs, particularly in
advanced disease, is that we’re completely wasting
our time, unless we can actually understand, in an
individual patient, what their operative pathway is.
We say we’re going to biopsy more patients, but
we’ve either got to insist when we’re developing these
studies that this happens, or else we’re not going to
do the study.
Dr. Johnston: So if the lapatinib study works, this
one or the SWOG one, then we might be able to find
a way forward in that specific pathway, but I think
everything else downstream—the AKTs, the mTORs,
and anything else—is really going to struggle.
Dr. William Miller: I agree with you, Paul. Unless
you identify the target and it’s very clear the target is
there, then if you do a trial, which is irrespective of
the target, you might get a disappointing result. If
you know the target is there, then you might get a
positive result.
Dr. Johnston: I think we’ve made it harder for ourselves to really try and work out what that target is.
Dr. Charles Coombes: I think if you look at the
real successes, EGFR inhibitors in patients with lung
cancer, there are specific, real areas for this sort of
therapy that you’ve been talking about. Having said
that, I did a theoretical sort of study on the studies
with gefitinib. Had we used, say, anastrozole and
ignored the finding that it was only active in ER-positives, so we didn’t screen the patients, the results would
have been exactly what you would expect with a second- or third-line aromatase inhibitor if you ignored
the ER. You would see only very few responses.
Dr. Goss: Ten years from now there’ll be companies buying shelved drugs and putting them back in
the clinic on the right targets and they’ll all work.
But you have to find each patient’s specific target,
then it’ll work.
Dr. Eric Winer: The measure of the target is not
just a matter of doing the biopsy. It’s figuring out
how to measure the target.
Dr. Jo Anne Zujewski: And what the target is.
Dr. Johnston: The problem is that the primary
tumor is the wrong thing to look at when we’re doing
these sorts of studies in advanced disease. Unlike
Her-2, which is obviously true gene application, the
vast majority of the others will be posttranslational
changes.
