ABSTRACT
Omental adipocytes promote ovarian cancer by secretion of adipokines, cytokines
and growth factors, and acting as fuel depots. We investigated if metformin modulates
the ovarian cancer promoting effects of adipocytes. Effect of conditioned media
obtained from differentiated mouse 3T3L1 preadipoctes on the proliferation and
migration of a mouse ovarian surface epithelium cancer cell line (ID8) was estimated.
Conditioned media from differentiated adipocytes increased the proliferation and
migration of ID8 cells, which was attenuated by metformin. Metformin inhibited
adipogenesis by inhibition of key adipogenesis regulating transcription factors (CEBPα,
CEBPß, and SREBP1), and induced AMPK. A targeted Cancer Pathway Finder RT-PCR
(real-time polymerase chain reaction) based gene array revealed 20 up-regulated and
2 down-regulated genes in ID8 cells exposed to adipocyte conditioned media, which
were altered by metformin. Adipocyte conditioned media also induced bio-energetic
changes in the ID8 cells by pushing them into a highly metabolically active state;
these effects were reversed by metformin. Collectively, metformin treatment inhibited
the adipocyte mediated ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, expression of
cancer associated genes and bio-energetic changes. Suggesting, that metformin could
be a therapeutic option for ovarian cancer at an early stage, as it not only targets
ovarian cancer, but also modulates the environmental milieu.

INTRODUCTION

of adipokines and help them in metastasizing by bestowing
a proliferative advantage and supply of fatty acids as
fuel [6]. Similar to omental adipocytes, the adipose
tissue at other sites has been shown to create a favorable
microenvironment for breast [7], gastric [8], and colon
cancers [9]. Adipocytes have been established as active
‘endocrine organs’ that secrete adipokines and cytokines
in response to external stimuli and provide metabolic and
immune regulatory functions [10]. These features enable
the adipocytes to not only support the tumor growth but
also engage in a cross-talk with the tumor cells.
Metformin, the most prescribed drug for Type II
diabetes, has been found to possess anticancer properties.
This has been shown in retrospective studies on breast [11],
prostate [12], colorectal [13], pancreatic [14], endometrial
[15] and ovarian malignancies [16]. Numerous preclinical

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer
death in women and the most fatal of all gynecological
cancers [1]. This high mortality has been attributed to
the presence of widespread peritoneal metastasis at the
time of diagnosis [2]. A unique feature of ovarian cancer
is its propensity to peritoneal spread, where it seems to
favor the omentum as one of its first metastatic sites [35]. At the time of diagnosis, over 60% of patients with
epithelial ovarian cancer present with an omentum loaded
with tumor [3, 6]. The omentum is largely composed
of adipocytes, and it is these adipocytes that have been
recently implicated as major players in attracting the
ovarian tumor cells [6]. It was recently demonstrated that
omental adipocytes bait the ovarian tumor cells by a slew

investigations have also demonstrated that metformin
inhibits growth of various cancer cells, including those
arising from breast [17], endometrium [18], ovary
[19], brain [20], lung [21], prostate [22], pancreas [23],
kidney [24], and colon [25]. We have recently shown
the efficacy of metformin alone and in combination with
cisplatin in reducing ovarian cancer growth both in vitro
and in vivo [19, 26]. We have also shown association
of metformin intake with better survival in a cohort of
ovarian cancer patient population [27]. Additionally,
metformin has been shown to ameliorate obesity and
ageing by targeting common pathways associate with
cancer, which could potentially be translated to its cancer
preventive potential [28-31]. Because of the widespread
laboratory and clinical based evidence, approximately
182 clinical trials investigating metformin’s potential in
human patient populations are currently ongoing [http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/].
The mechanism of action of metformin has been
shown to be mainly due to the activation of a master
metabolism regulator, adenosine monophosphate activated
kinase (AMPK), via its upstream kinase, liver kinase
B1 [32]. AMPK is a hetero-trimeric kinase that along
with regulation of metabolic pathways also participates
in various signaling pathways and controls protein
expression [33]. Its anticancer effects are mainly carried
out by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway and cell cycle [19, 25, 34]. It has also
been shown to inhibit tumors through indirect effects of
lowering glucose, insulin and insulin growth factor-1
levels [35, 36]. While recent reports have shown that
metformin can also act in AMPK-independent manner [22,
37], most of its manifold effects can still be attributed to
activation of AMPK. Most of the studies on cancer cells
have focused more on the signaling effects of metformin
and AMPK activation, while not much attention has been
given to the vast metabolic changes that are associated
with AMPK activation. AMPK by virtue of its metabolic
regulatory effect also regulates adipogenesis and lipolysis
[38, 39], placing it in a unique position to alter the
adipocyte generated microenvironment for the tumor
cells. Both adipogenesis and lipolysis have been shown to
aid the ovarian tumor cells in proliferation and metastasis
[6]. Recently, an effect of obesity (adiposity) on cancer
promotion has been in focus. Conditions of increased
adiposity results in an increased in mTOR signaling,
inflammatory factors and growth factors like insulin and
IGF-1. Metformin has been reported to inhibit almost
all of these propagators in models of obesity, aging and
cancer making it as a good agent to target adipocyte
specific tumor enhancing effects [28].
Recent research suggests that ovarian cancer cells
use omental adipocytes as their first repository to derive
energy and multiply in number in preparation for further
growth and spread [6]. Therefore, it would be rational
to design and test therapies that can target this first

step in the ovarian cancer metastasis and may prevent
its further spread. With this objective, we investigated
whether metformin can regulate the adipocyte-adipokine
stimulated ovarian cancer growth and therefore impact
the initial steps of ovarian cancer metastasis. Overall,
our study shows that metformin has the ability to inhibit
adipogenesis and the ovarian tumor promoting effects
driven by adipocytes.

RESULTS
Metformin
inhibited
adipocyte
induced
proliferation of ID8 ovarian cancer cells
To examine the effect of adipocyte conditioned
media (adipo CM) on the growth of ID8 mouse ovarian
tumor cells, ID8 cells were exposed with Rosewell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI) media and adipo CM at
various ratios (75:25; 50:50; 0:100). A dose dependent
increase in proliferation was observed at 48 and 72h
compared to the cells cultured in basal media (mix
of RPMI and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
[DMEM]) (Fig. 1Ai & Aii). Treatment of ID8 cells with
metformin at low concentrations (2-4 mM) inhibited the
adipo CM mediated increased proliferation of ID8 cells
at both time points (Fig. 1Bi & Bii). CM from adipocytes
differentiated in presence of metformin (2 and 4 mM)
significantly decreased proliferation of ID8 cells (Fig. 1Ci
& Cii). These data indicate that adipo CM can accelerate
the growth of ovarian cancer cells and this effect can
be attenuated by metformin treatments, either to the
differentiating adipocytes or to the ID8 cells.

Metformin

adipocyte
induced
migration-invasion of ID8 ovarian cancer cells
We next examined the effect of adipo CM on cell
migration and invasion using scratch and Boyden chamber
migration and invasion assays, respectively. As shown in
Figure 2Ai, adipo CM significantly increased (~ 50 fold)
the migration of ID8 cells. However, metformin treated
adipocyte CM (adipo Met CM; metformin 2 and 4 mM)
had significantly less effect on cell migration (Fig. 2Ai).
Treatment of the ID8 cells with metformin also inhibited
adipo CM mediated ID8 cell migration (Fig. 2Aii). For
assessing invasion, Boyden chamber migration and
invasion assay was used as described in the methods.
Invasion of ID8 cells was increased ~ 4-fold in response
to adipo CM (Fig. 2Bi), while the invasion was less in
response to adipo Met CM at the higher dose of metformin
(4 mM) (Fig. 2Bi). Metformin treatment of ID8 cells at
both doses inhibited the adipo CM mediated invasion of
ID8 cells (Fig. 2Bii). These data suggest that adipocytes
have a profound effect on the migration and invasion of

ID8 cells and metformin treatment can attenuate both
migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells facilitated
by adipocytes.

To confirm that the inhibitory effects of metformin at 2
and 4 mM on ID8 proliferation, migration and invasion
are specific to counteract the adipo CM mediated effect
and not a direct effect on the ID8 cells, ID8 cells were
treated with various doses of metformin (1-5 mM) and
cell proliferation was assessed by metformin, trypan blue,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Metformin did not result in any
significant changes in proliferation at 48 or 72 hours at any
dose (Fig. S1Ai & Aii). Furthermore, metformin did not

Metformin has been shown by us and others to
inhibit proliferation of ovarian cancer cells [19, 40].

FIGURE 1: Metformin inhibited adipocyte driven growth of ID8 ovarian cancer cells. 3T3L1 mouse preadipocytes were

differentiated into adipocytes over a period of 9 days and conditioned media (CM) was collected and used to treat ID8 cells. Mouse ovarian
cancer cell line ID8 was exposed to the adipocyte CM (adipo CM) at various dilutions (0-100%) in basal media and MTT assay performed
at 48 (Ai) and 72 (Aii) hours (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to 0, basal media). ID8 cells were exposed to 50% adipo CM
in presence of 2 and 4 mM concentration of metformin. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay performed at 48 (Bi) and 72 hours
(Bii) (###p<0.001 compared to basal media; ***p < 0.001 metformin treated compared to adipo CM alone). ID8 cells were exposed to the
50% adipo CM or 50% CM from adipocytes that were treated with different concentrations of metformin while differentiating (adipo M2
CM: metformin 2 mM and adipo M4 CM: metformin 4 mM). Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay performed at 48 (Ci), and 72
(Cii) hours (###p < 0.001, #p < 0.05, ns: non-significant compared to basal media; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 metformin treated compared

affect migration (Fig. S1B) or invasion (Fig. S1C) of ID8
cells, induced by 10% FBS as seen by scratch assay and
Boyden Chamber assay, respectively. Thus, the inhibitory
action of metformin seen in ID8 in presence of adipo CM
is specific to that driven by adipocytes.

For this goal, mouse preadipocytes cell line (3T3L1) was
differentiated as described in the methods. Metformin was
added at various time points during 3T3L1 differentiation
process including day 0, 3, or 5. Adipocyte differentiation
was examined on day 9 by Oil Red O staining as evident
by red stained numerous lipid droplets. Addition of
metformin from day 0 (Fig. 3A) or day 3 (Fig. 3B) of
differentiation resulted in a dose dependent inhibition
of lipid accumulation. Quantitative analysis of the lipid
content reflected a significant inhibition of lipid droplet
accumulation in dose dependent manner (Fig. 3Ci & Cii).
Addition of metformin on day 5 of the differentiation had

Metformin treatment inhibited adipogenesis
Since metformin can inhibit lipid biosynthesis by
activation of AMPK [19, 41], we investigated whether
metformin would alter the differentiation of adipocytes.

FIGURE 2: Metformin inhibited adipocyte induced migration-invasion of ID8 ovarian cancer cells. (Ai) ID8 cells grown

to confluence were kept in low serum conditions (0.2%) overnight and scratch assay was performed as described in the Methods section. The
media was replaced by respective conditioned media as indicated with adipocyte CM (adipo CM) and CM from adipocytes differentiated
in presence of metformin 2 or 4 mM (adipo M2 CM or adipo M4 CM). The pixel distance between the gap was measured at a designated
point at 0 and 24 hours. The distance covered at 24 hours was subtracted from the 0 time point to estimate the area covered by the migrating
cells (###p < 0.001, ##p < 0.01 compared to basal media; **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001 compared to adipo CM). (Aii) ID8 cells were treated
with metformin (2 or 4mM) in presence of adipo CM. Migration was measured for all groups (###p < 0.001, ##p < 0.01 compared to

4mM) was estimated using Boyden Chamber (##p < 0.01, #p < 0.05 compared to basal media; **p < 0.001, *p < 0.05, ns: non-significant
compared to adipo CM alone). (Bii) ID8 cells were treated with metformin (2 or 4mM) in presence of adipo CM and invasion of ID8 cells
was estimated (##p < 0.01, #p < 0.05 compared to basal media; **p < 0.001, *p < 0.05, ns: non-significant compared to adipo CM).

no effect on the number of lipid droplet accumulation (data
not shown). Furthermore, metformin at low concentrations
(1-4 mM) also inhibited the proliferation of preadipocytes
(Fig. S2), confirming that metformin can attenuate the
expansion of preadipocytes and also effectively inhibit the
conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes.

activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) expression was
also increased from day 0 to 6 to 9 of differentiation,
but metformin had no effect on its expression (Figs.
4A & S3C). Similarly, metformin did not modulate the
expression of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate
lyase (Figs 4A & S3E). Densitometric analysis of the
blots reflects the time dependent changes in expression
profiles (Fig. S3). Metformin treatment induced AMPK
activation at both day 6 and day 9 as seen by increased
phosphorylated form of AMPK and its immediate
downstream target phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase
(ACC; Figs. 4B & S3F, G). These data indicate that
metformin treatment activates and maintains the activated
state of AMPK, which correlates with inhibition of key
adipogenesis transcription factors and subsequent halting
of preadipocyte differentiation to adipocytes.

Metformin inhibited adipogenesis by regulating
transcription factors and activating AMPK
Adipogenesis is regulated by coordinated activation
of various transcription factors [42]. To understand the
molecular mechanism of metformin mediated inhibition
of adipogenesis, the effect of metformin on the expression
of key transcriptions factors was examined at 2 time points
(day 6 and 9) during adipocyte differentiation. CCAATenhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPα) was increased
from day 0 to 6 to 9 of differentiation and inhibited by
metformin treatment. CCAAT-enhancer binding protein
beta (CEBPß), expression also showed a similar pattern
(Figs. 4A & S3B). Maximal sterol regulatory elementbinding protein -1 (SREBP1) expression was reached
on day 6, and plateaued through day 9. It was inhibited
by metformin at both time points in a dose dependent
response (Figs. 4A & S3D). Peroxisome proliferator-

Metformin inhibited adipocyte mediated lipid
accumulation in ID8 cells
To investigate if metformin can limit the lipid droplet
formation in ID8 cells by adipocytes, we exposed the ID8
cells to adipo CM and stained for lipid droplets using the
Bopidy stain. Adipo CM induced robust formation of lipid
droplets in the ID8 cells (Fig. 5A, second panel), while

FIGURE 3: Metformin inhibited adipocyte differentiation. 3T3L1 mouse preadipocytes were differentiated over a period of 9

days. One set was treated from day 0 (A) or day 3 (B) with various concentrations of metformin (1-5mM). Differentiation of adipocytes
was monitored by accumulation of lipid droplets visualized by Oil Red O staining. The accumulated lipid droplets were quantified by
coloriemeteric absorbance (Ci, Cii) (##p < 0.001 compared to undifferentiated preadipocytes (undiff); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

Metformin attenuated expression of adipocyte
induced tumor promoting genes

adipo Met CM induced minimal lipid accumulation (Fig.
5A, third panel). Treating the ID8 cells with metformin
(4 mM), reduced adipo CM mediated lipid accumulation
but did not inhibit it completely (Fig. 5A, last panel).
Metformin treatment induced the phosphorylation of
AMPK and ACC in ID8 cells (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 & 2) in
presence of adipo CM (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 & 4). ID8 cells
exposed to adipo Met CM (metformin 2mM) also showed
increased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC (Fig. 5B,
lane 5). These data indicate that metformin treatment to
the differentiating adipocytes or the ID8 cells results in
the activation of AMPK pathway which correlates with
diminished lipid accumulation in the cancer cells.

To further examine the mechanism of adipocyte
mediated cancer cell growth and metformin effect, we
used the Mouse Cancer PathwayFinder™ RT² Profiler™
PCR Array to ascertain the changes in tumor promoting
genes occurring in ID8 cells exposed to adipocyte CM
that could be responsible for its pro-tumorigenic effects.
Out of the 84 genes explored (Fig. S4), 22 genes were
found to be differentially modulated by more than 2-fold
(Fig. 6A). Out of these 22 genes, 20 were up-regulated
and 2 were down-regulated (Fig. 6A). The modulated
genes observed were spread across the 9 cancer pathways,
which included angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle,
cell senescence, DNA damage and repair, epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, metabolism
and telomeres and telomerase (Fig. S4). We next tested
the effect of metformin treatment on ID8 cells on the
expression of these 22 genes in the presence of adipo CM
and adipo Met CM. The top 6 highly up-regulated and the
2 down-regulated genes are depicted in Figure 6B, while
the rest are presented in a supplementary figure (Fig. S5).
Mouse Ki-67 (mKi-67), the most highly up-regulated
gene in the array (~ 14 fold), was found to be up-regulated
3-fold on validation and showed an inhibitory trend under
metformin treatment both when the treatment was made
to the differentiating adipocytes (second last bar) or when
the ID8 cells were exposed to adipocyte CM (last bar)
(Fig. 6Bi). CCl-2 (chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2), also
known as monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP1) and placental growth factor (Pgf) were approximately
increased by 15-fold and 4-fold respectively by adipocyte
CM (Fig. 6Bii & Biii). Metformin inhibited the expression
of both the genes in ID8, when exposed to adipo CM or
adipo Met CM (Fig. 6Bii & Biii). Adm (Adrenomedullin)
was validated by an approximately 7-fold increase under
adipo CM and was also inhibited by metformin treatments
(Fig. 6Biv). Pfkl (Phosphofructokinase, liver, B-type) was
up-regulated by 3-fold in ID8 cells exposed to adipo CM
(Fig. 6Bv), while metformin treatment in basal media and
adipo CM, induced Pfkl expression by 2-fold (Fig. 6Bv).
Gadd45g (Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45
gamma) was seen to be up-regulated by adipo CM only
by approximately 1.5 fold, while metformin treatments
completely inhibited its expression (Fig. 6Bvi). The two
down-regulated genes observed in the PCR-array were
Serpin B2 (Serine [or cysteine] peptidase inhibitor, clade
B, member 2) and FasL (Fas ligand, tumor necrosis
factor superfamily, member 6). Interestingly, the results
of Serpin B2 validation PCR were completely opposite
to that of the PCR-array, as the Serpin B2 expression
was seen to be induced by approximately 1.5 fold rather
than inhibited (2-fold in the array) by adipo CM and was
inhibited by various metformin treatments (Fig. 6Bvii).
FasL was validated to be down-regulated in ID8 cells

Protein was isolated from differentiating adipocytes on days 0,
6 and 9 in the presence or absence of metformin (2 and 4 mM).

antibodies. Beta-actin was used as control for equal protein
loading. (B) Same protein samples were also immuno-blotted

under adipo CM and was up-regulated by metformin
(Fig. 6Bvii). Amongst the other up-regulated genes,
Dsp (Desmoplakin), Pinx1 (PIN2/TERF1 interacting,
telomerase inhibitor 1), nol3 (Nucleolar protein 3
[apoptosis repressor with CARD domain]), Snai1 (Snail
homolog 1 [Drosophila]), Tinf2 (Terf1 [TRF1]-interacting
nuclear factor 2), Ppp1R15a (protein phosphatase 1,
regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 15A), Auraka (aurora kinase
A) validated as being up-regulated by 2-fold or more by
adipo CM in ID8 cells (Fig. S5A-D & I-K). Except for
AurakA, which was increased, all others were inhibited by
metformin treatments both to the differentiating adipocytes
and ID8 under adipo CM. Sirt2 (Sirtuin 2 [silent mating
type information regulation 2, homolog] 2 [S. cerevisiae]),
IGFBP7 (Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7),
Birc3 (baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3) and GSc
(goosecoid homeobox) showed a trend towards higher
expression (approximately 1.5 fold) with adipo CM
(Fig. S5E, G, M, N). Metformin inhibited the expression
of IGFBP7 and Birc3 (Fig. S5G & M), while it did not
have any effect on the expression of GSc (Fig. S5N), and
increased the expression of Sirt2 (Fig. S5E). No change

was observed in the expressions of CcnD3 (Cyclin D3)
and Ing1 (inhibitor of growth family, member 1) (Fig. S5F
& L). Overall, adipo CM induced several genes in the ID8
ovarian cancer cells in order to promote the growth and
survival, and metformin affected the expression of these
tumor-promoting genes.

MCP-1 and Pgf neutralization blocks adipocyte
driven ID8 proliferation
MCP-1 and Pgf emerged as the most up-regulated
growth factors in the ID8 cells in response to adipo CM
exposure. The levels of both cytokines were estimated in
the adipo CM (Fig. S6Ai & Bi) used to treat ID8 cells, in
the supernatants of ID8 cells exposed to adipo CM and in
presence of metformin and adipo Met CM (2 and 4mM) at
48 hours. The subtraction value of the two estimates was
taken as the level being exclusively produced by the ID8
cells under the influence of adipo CM (Fig. 7A). MCP-1
expression was induced ~ 7-fold in ID8 cells by adipo CM
exposure. Adipo Met CM (2 mM) induced significantly

adipocyte CM (adipo CM) or CM from adipocytes differentiated in presence of metformin 2 or 4 mM (adipo M4 CM, or adipo CM) in the
presence of metformin (adipo CM + M4) for 72-96 hours in chamber slides. The cells were stained with Bodipy 493/503 and counterstained
with Hoechst 33342 as described in the Methods. The lipid droplets were stained green and visualized with a fluroscent microscope at
40x magnification. (B) Under same conditions, the protein extracted was subjected to western blot and immuno-blotted for expression of
phosphorylated (p) and total (t) adenosine monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Micrographs and
blots are representative of 2 individually performed experiments.

less expression of MCP-1, while adipo Met CM (4
mM) completely inhibited its production. Metformin
treatment of ID8 cells was also able to attenuate the adipo
CM induced MCP-1 production by ID8 cells (Fig. 7A).
Adipo CM induced Pgf by ~ 5 fold in ID8 cells, while
adipo Met CM showed significantly lower levels of Pgf
in ID8 cells. Metformin treatment to ID8 was also able
to inhibit the production of Pgf induced by adipo CM.
Thus, soluble factors being produced by adipocytes are
able to modulate ID8 cancer cells, which in turn produced
increased amounts of these mitogenic, immunogenic and
angiogenic factors. Metformin has the ability to act both
on the differentiating adipocytes and their crosstalk with

the cancer cells, in order to inhibit the expression of these
pro-tumorigenic factors.
To assess the contribution of these chemokines on
ID8 potentiated growth observed under the influence of
adipo CM, respective neutralization antibodies were added
to the various CM and ID8 cells before evaluating their
effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 7C & D). The increased
proliferation observed by adipo CM was inhibited by
MCP-1 antibody. Combining the antibody with metformin
further enhanced the inhibition of ID8 cell proliferation.
Neutralization of MCP-1 antibody further inhibited
proliferation of ID8 cells induced by adipo Met CM
treatment (Fig. 7C). An exactly similar trend was observed

suggest that both MCP-1 and Pgf are crucial contributors
to the adipocyte mediated growth potentiation of ID8 cells

Seahorse bioanalyzer, we found that ID8 cells exposed
to the adipo CM showed higher glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation (OX-PHOS) kinetics (Fig. 8A & B)
compared to cells grown in basal media. Cells exposed
to adipo Met CM did not show much change in the
glycolysis; however, metformin treatment of ID8 cells
showed slightly increased glycolysis (Fig. 8C). On the
other hand, ID8 cells in the presence of adipo Met CM
showed decreased OX-PHOS and direct treatment of
metformin to ID8 cells completely inhibited OX-PHOS

Since proliferating cancer cells have been shown to
metabolically adapt and shift towards using glycolysis as
the main energy source [43, 44], we investigated if the
exposure to adipo CM would result in any bioenergetic

statistically significant. Adipo Met CM also showed a
similar pattern, while metformin treatment of the ID8
cells showed the same level of glycolysis as normal ID8
cells (Fig. 8E). On the other hand the basal respiration
(OX-PHOS) was itself significantly increased in ID8 cells
exposed to adipo CM compared to cells in basal media
(Fig. 8E, 2nd bar vs 1st bar). Adipo Met CM or direct
treatment to the ID8 cells significantly inhibited OXPHOS (Fig. 8E, last 3 bars). The capacity for maximum
glycolysis as well as respiration was significantly
increased in the presence of adipo CM in the ID8 cells,
though the increase in maximal respiration was much more
significant compared to glycolysis (Figs. 8F & G). Thus,
metformin treatment of the differentiating adipocytes and
the ID8 cells did not affect glycolysis much in cancer cells
but inhibited the capacity for increased OX-PHOS. These
data indicate that the adipocyte environment is capable of
inducing bioenergetic changes in the cancer cells even at
short exposure times and metformin treatment modulates
these changes.

Our study supports both the direct and indirect effects
of metformin, showcasing the indirect effects whereby
metformin is retarding the growth of ovarian cancer
cells that is being specifically promoted by the adipocyte
component of the microenvironment. Metformin can act at
multiple levels regulating factors that arise systematically
as well as those produced by the cancer cell itself to reduce
and prevent cancer growth [30, 52].
Metformin completely inhibited the differentiation
of preadipocytes to adipocytes by attenuating the key
transcription factors. CEBP and PPAR are considered
early adiopgenesis genes. They are thought to be involved
in growth arrest that is a prerequisite for differentiation,
and they also trans-activate other adipocyte specific genes
[42]. SREBP1 participates in cholesterol metabolism and
activation of other adipocyte gene expression [42]. ATPcitrate lyase is a terminal phase enzyme that is involved in
de novo lipogenesis [42]. SREBP1, CEBPα and CEBPß
were inhibited by metformin treatment without altering
the levels of ATP citrate lyase or PPARγ expression
(Figs. 3 & 4). The specific inhibition of some, but not
all, adipogenic transcription factors suggests that the
regulation of adipogenesis in the adipocytes by metformin
is specific. Metformin also induced AMPK activation in
those cells as observed by higher levels of phosphorylation
of AMPK and its downstream target ACC. We have
previously shown that activation of AMPK by AICAR
(5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) results
in inhibition of adipogenesis in 3T3L1 preadipocytes
along with inhibition of adipogenic transcription factors
[53]. Thus, activation of AMPK may play a regulatory role
in lipid metabolism.
It was recently reported that adipocytes can promote
lipid accumulation in ovarian cancer cells by providing
fatty acids [6]. The underlying mechanism was suggested
to be an up-regulation of fatty acid transporter gene,
fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), in the ovarian
cancer cells positioned next to adipocytes to facilitate
the transport of fatty acids [6]. In our experimental
model, the adipo CM induced lipid droplet formation in
the ID8 cells. This lipid accumulation was inhibited to
various degrees when either the adipocytes or the cancer
cells were treated with metformin (Fig. 5). Metformin
has been shown to decrease intracellular lipid levels in
various cells such as hepatocytes, preadipocytes, skeletal
muscle and macrophages [41, 53-55]. Song et al. [55]
also demonstrated that metformin can reduce fatty acid
induced lipid accumulation in a macrophage cell line
by downregulation of FABP4 and up-regulating CPT1 (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1). FABP4 has been
shown to play a critical role in uptake of fatty acids and
accumulation of lipid [56], while CPT-1 is a rate limiting
enzyme in the fatty-oxidation process [57]. Thus it can
be hypothesized that along with inhibition of de novo
lipogenesis, metformin may regulate the transport of fatty
acids supplied by the adipocytes into the tumor cells.

DISCUSSION
The role of the microenvironment in promoting
the growth and metastasis of tumors is well recognized.
The previously overlooked adipocytes are now
considered vital components and regulators of the tumor
microenvironment. They release various adipokines,
cytokines, energy rich lipids and fatty acids which
provide a fertile milieu for tumor cells to propagate [10,
45]. Ovarian cancer, a predominantly abdominal cancer,
has been known to use omentum as one of its first sites
of metastasis [2, 4]. A recent study demonstrated that
the omental adipocytes attract the ovarian cancer cells
to home to the omentum by secreting adipokines and
subsequently providing a supply of fatty acids to meet the
energy needs for rapid proliferation [6]. Any therapies that
can disrupt the adipocyte-tumor cell interaction may be of
significant benefit in hindering the initial step of ovarian
cancer metastasis.
Our present study demonstrates that adipocyte
derived CM promotes the growth, migration and invasion
of the ID8 mouse ovarian cancer cells. These tumor
promoting effects are associated with downstream
function and gene expression and bioenergetic changes in
the ovarian cancer cells. Studies have shown that breast
adipocytes create a favorable microenvironment that
promotes breast cancer growth [46, 47]. Furthermore,
adipocytes have been shown to promote the growth or
invasion of prostate [48], endometrial [49], lung [50],
colon [9], gastric [51] and ovarian cancer cells [6]. Our
findings of increased proliferation, migration and invasion
of ovarian cancer cells under the influence of adipo CM
are in line with these findings. These tumor promoting
effects of the adipocytes can be significantly abrogated by
metformin treatment through a number of mechanisms.

Another mechanism by which metformin and AMPK
activation may impede lipid accumulation in cancer cells
involves the inhibition of lipolysis, which is responsible
for the release of fatty acids from the adipocytes. Bourron
et al. [58] have found that metformin inhibits stimulated
lipolysis in human adipocytes and causes inactivation of
hormone sensitive lipase translocation to the lipid droplet.
Activation of hormone sensitive lipase has been associated
with increased levels of free fatty acids in adipocytes and
their uptake by cancer cells [6].
The mature adipocytes are now recognized as active
endocrine organs that not only function as energy depots
for the body but also secrete factors that are known to
regulate immune response, vascular diseases and cancer
[10]. Some of these secretary factors include adipokines,
cytokines and chemokines which enhance tumor cell
proliferation, migration and invasion [6, 47]. We observed
that these tumor enhancing abilities of the adipocytes’
secretory products were accompanied by gene expression
changes in the ID8 cells (Fig. 6). Twenty-two genes
were differentially modulated by a minimum of 2-fold
and spanned multiple pathways including angiogenesis
(Ccl-2, Pgf), apoptosis (FasL, Birc3, Nol3), cell cycle
(MKi-67, AuraKa, CcnD3, Stmn1), DNA damage and
repair (Gadd45g, Ppp1r15a), cell senescence (SerpinB2,
IGFBP7, Ing1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Dsp,
Snai1, GSc), hypoxia (Adm), metabolism (Pfkl) and
telomere and telomerase (Pinx1, Sirt2, Tinf2) pathways.
The top 6 genes up-regulated by 5-fold in ID8
cells when exposed to adipo CM included Ki-67, MCP1, Pgf, Adm, Pfkl and Gadd45g; on the other hand,
2 genes (SerinB2 and FasL) were found to be downregulated. Ki-67 is a cellular proliferation marker shown
to be highly expressed in almost all proliferating tumor
cells and its expression (Ki-index) is often co-related
with cancer progression [59]. We have previously shown
metformin treatment to inhibit Ki-67 in ovarian tumors
in vivo [26]. MCP-1, one of the most up-regulated genes
in our model, has been shown to promote proliferation,
migration and invasion of cancer cells. It has also been
demonstrated to attract tumor-associated macrophages
and other inflammatory cells towards the tumors [60,
61]. MCP-1 has also been implicated in adipogenesis
and has been shown to be produced by adipocytes [62].
Nieman et al. [6] also has identified MCP-1 as one of the
highly expressed cytokines in the omental adipo CM. Pgf
belongs to the VEGF family and signals through VEGFr1
(Flt-1) [63] to promote angiogenesis [47, 64]. It has been
shown to be highly expressed in cancers like renal, colon,
pancreatic, melanoma, colorectal, lung, gastric and breast
[65-70]. One study in ovarian cancer has shown increased
Pgf plasma levels to be associated with poor prognosis
[71]. On the other hand, a variant Pgf (Plgf2) has been
shown to inhibit tumor growth by blocking VEGFa [72].
In our current study, we found that adipocytes secreted
high MCP-1, but did not appear to produce Pgf. Both
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MCP-1 and Pgf were induced in the ID8 cancer cells
by adipo CM (Fig. 7).Both MCP-1 and Pgf expression
were inhibited by metformin. Complete inhibition of
ID8 growth was observed after neutralization of these 2
proteins by their respective antibodies.
Adm, another gene upregulated by adipocytes
in the ID8 cells, encodes a peptide that belongs to the
calcitonin superfamily and is induced by various cytokines
and hypoxic conditions. It has been shown to induce
proliferation of breast and endometrial cells and promote
vasculogenesis [73, 74]. PfKl is a key enzyme in the
glycolysis pathway and has been associated with increased
glycolytic capacity of the cell [75]. Gadd45g is a gene that
is expressed under stress conditions or DNA damaging
conditions and activates the p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinases
pathway [76]. It is a putative tumor suppressor gene and
is down-regulated in multiple cancers [77]. Gadd45g was
surprisingly up-regulated in ID8 cells by adipo CM and
completely inhibited by metformin.
FasL, a membrane protein belonging to the tumor
necrosis factor family [78], was down-regulated by
adipo CM and was up-regulated by metformin. FasL
induces apoptosis, but also plays a vital role in deterring
autoimmune response in immune privileged sites. Due
to these different actions, it is believed to have a dual
role in cancer progression [79, 80]. In ovarian cancer,
high FasL expression and secretion have been linked to
prevention of immune cell mediated cell death [80, 81].
In our model, it is possible that the inhibition of FasL by
adipocytes indicates a means of subduing the apoptosis
pathway while metformin helps to reinstate it. We have not
measured the secretory FasL, which plays a greater role in
modulating the immune escape of tumor cells and our in
vitro system is devoid of immune cell presence. Serbinb2,
also known as PAI-2 (Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2),
was the second down-regulated gene in the array, but on
validation we found it to be 1.5 fold up-regulated in ID8
cells exposed to the CM. Metformin treatments, both to
the differentiating adipocytes or to the ID8 cells, resulted
in its decreased expression. Serbinb2 is an inhibitor of uPA
(urokinase plasminogen activator) and has been shown to
be expressed in adipocytes among other cells and promote
adipogenesis [82]. It also plays a role in inflammation and
cisplatin chemo-resistance [83]. Three genes (CCND3,
STMN1 and Ing1) were not increased on validation; this
discrepancy could be explained by the difference in the
primers used for validation or a false positive result in the
array.
One adaptation by the cancer cells to meet the
demands of increased proliferation and to overcome
adverse conditions is to utilize glycolysis as the primary
source of ATP generation in lieu of mitochondrial
oxidative respiration (OX-PHOS). It was interesting to
observe that the adipo CM enhanced both glycolysis and
OX-PHOS in ID8 cells. While cancer cells are believed
to be highly glycolytic as per the ‘Warburg effect’ [84],
4757

MATERIALS AND METHODS

the implications of an increased OX-PHOS state has not
been previously elucidated in cancer cells. Increased
glycolysis supports the demand of cancer cells for
increased macromolecules [43]. The increased OX-PHOS
can be postulated to be occurring due to the excess of fatty
acids being supplied by adipocytes, which is oxidized in
mitochondria through the OX-PHOS pathway. Thus the
cues provided by the adipo CM provides dual advantage
to the cancer cells in terms of achieving higher glycolysis
as well as OX-PHOS capability, which could be aiding
faster proliferation and higher energy availability to
the cell. Metformin did not further increase glycolysis
above that observed with adipo CM but did significantly
inhibit OX-PHOS. This is in agreement with other studies
where metformin has been shown to enhance glycolysis
but inhibit OX-PHOS [85-87]. Whether decreased OXPHOS contributes to the inhibition of ID8 proliferation
by metformin remains to be determined. Interestingly,
rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR pathway, showed
similar effects as metformin in obese conditions and
aging, however, rapamycin treatment ameliorates lactate
production, which would indicate inhibition of glycolysis
[88, 89], while metformin has been reported to induce
glycolysis. Overall, these studies where by adipocytes
contribute nutritionally to the microenvironment to
influence the bioenergetics of tumor cell are supported
by the paradigm of obesity (excess adiposity) being the
provider of surplus nutrition which results in aggressive
tumor growth and upregulation or inhibition of nutrition
sensitive signaling pathways like mTOR and AMPK [28,
29]. Metformin has the ability to not only regulate cellular
energetics by regulating mitochondrial activity but also by
the signaling that controls the energy state of the cell.
Our present work is completely based on an in vitro
approach, which is one of the limitations of our study.
These in vitro techniques are well used in research and
have recently been validated by in vivo models. A recent
comprehensive report by Clark et al. [90] establishes
the importance of immune cell rich milky spots in
conjunction with adipose tissue (omentum and spleen) for
metastasizing of ovarian cancer. Overall, our data strongly
supports the role of adipocytes in promoting ovarian
tumor growth, particularly by the production of various
adipokines and their consequent effects on cancer cells
that encompass functional, genotypic and bioenergetic
changes, which collectively enhance the growth and
spread of ovarian tumors. Metformin, by regulating
adipogenesis and altering adipokines and their stimulant
effects on ovarian cancer cells, is a promising candidate
drug to disrupt the adipocyte-cancer cell crosstalk and
mitigate tumor progression.

from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, California, USA) and
anti-MCP-1 was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO).

Tissue culture
3T3L1 mouse preadipocytes were obtained from
Dr. Giri’s laboratory. The cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) and used
till passage 8. ID8 mouse ovarian cancer cells were a
gift from Dr. Keith Knutson, (Vaccine & Gene Therapy
Institute of Florida, Port Saint Lucie, FL) and were
maintained in RPMI media containing 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (FBS). All media and FCS were purchased
from HyClone-ThermoScientific (Waltham, MA, USA) or
Gibco Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). FBS
was purchased from BioAbChem (Ladson, SC, USA).

Adipocyte differentiation
Differentiation was initiated using chemicals from
Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) as described
before [53]. Briefly, 3T3L1 preadipocytes were cultured in
DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS and plated in 100 mm
dishes. Once the cells reached confluence (48-72 h later),
cells were induced to differentiate by replacing media with
induction media containing 10% (v/v) FBS, insulin (1.7
μmol/L), 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mmol/L), and
dexamethasone (DEX, 1 μmol/L). After 3 days, induction
media was replaced with media containing insulin. Media
was changed every alternate day. Differentiation was
estimated by performing Oil Red O staining. Adipocyte
differentiation was observed at 70-80% by days 7-9. For
experiments with metformin treatments, metformin was
added to the respective media either from day 0 or day
3 of differentiation. At differentiation (day 8), cells were
washed with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice
and cultured for an additional 48 hours in regular DMEM
media. CM was collected filtered and stored at -20°C till
further use.

distance covered was subtracted from the start time point
to estimate the distance covered by the migrating cells
[91].

Predifferentiated and differentiated adipocytes were
washed twice with PBS and fixed in formaldehyde (3.7%)
for 1 hour. Oil red O solution (0.2% (w/v) in 60% (v/v)
isopropanol) was applied for 30 minutes. Cells were then
washed with water and slides were dried by placing them
under the flow hood and examined under bright-field.
In order to quantitate the adipose conversion, 0.2 ml of
isopropanol was added to the stained cells and absorbance
was measured using a spectrophotometer at 510 nm [53].

Boyden chamber migration and invasion assay
Cell migration and invasion were measured as
previously described [92] with some modifications.
Briefly, ID8 cell suspension (500 µl, 2.5×104 cells) was
seeded on the top of Matrigel-coated (invasion assay)
8-µm pore diameter transwell plate from BD Biosciences
(San Jose, California, USA). The CM from differentiated
adipocytes in presence or absence of metformin was
placed in the lower chamber. For exogenous metformin
treatment of ID8 cells, the ID8 cells were pretreated
with metformin overnight before seeding in the matrigel
chamber. For these studies we exposed the ID8 cells to
100% CM (0:100; RPMI:adipo CM) to promote significant
invasion. Cells invading the lower chamber were stained
with 0.5% crystal violet (60% PBS, 40% ethyl alcohol)
and counted with an inverted microscope. The invaded
cells were also lysed in isopropanol to estimate the
invasion by colorimetric assessment by reading the
optical density at 575 nm. The results from at least two
independent experiments in triplicate are presented.

Metformin treatments
The effect of metformin was examined using
two approaches. The first one involved directly adding
metformin in the media during adipocyte differentiation.
On day 7, adipocytes were washed with sterile PBS and
replaced with fresh complete media without metformin.
Forty-eight hours later, CM was collected, filtered and
stored at -20°C till further use. CM was used to examine
the effect of adipo CM and adipo Met CM on ID8 cell
proliferation, migration and invasion. The second
approach involved direct treatment of ID8 cells with
metformin in presence of adipo CM. In the first approach,
we were assessing the production of soluble factors
and lipids by the maturing adipocytes under metformin
treatment, while in the second approach we were studying
the ability of metformin to block the stimulatory effects of
adipocyte soluble factors on the cancer cells.

Western blots
Differentiating adipocytes in the presence or
absence of metformin at indicated time points were
washed with PBS and lysed in 500 µl of protein lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 50 mM NaF,
and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). ID8 cells under
CM exposure were also similarly harvested at 24 hours.
Supernatant was separated and protein concentration was
estimated by the Bradford method (BioRad, Hercules, CA,
USA). Immunoblot analysis was performed using various
antibodies as previously described [19].

Proliferation assays
To determine the effect of adipocytes on
proliferation of ID8 cells, 4000 cells per well were
plated in 96-well plates in RPMI media containing 10%
(v/v) FBS overnight. Media was replaced the next day
with a mixture of complete RPMI media and the CM in
various ratios (75:25; 50:50; 0:100). For all subsequent
experiments an optimal ratio (50:50; RPMI:CM) was used.
Metformin treatment to the ID8 cells was done at the same
time of media replacements. MTT assay was performed
at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-treatment as described earlier
[19].

Bodipy stain
ID8 cells were grown in RPMI:adipo CM (50:50)
for 72-96 hours in 8-well chamber slides [93]. Cells
were washed, fixed in paraformaldehyde and stained
with Bodipy 493/503 (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY, USA) at 1:1000 dilutions for 15 minutes as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were counterstained
with Hoechst 33342 and mounted in vectashield. The lipid
droplets stained green were visualized with a fluorescent
microscope at 40x magnification.

Scratch migration assay
ID8 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well
plates and kept in low serum conditions (0.2%) overnight.
A scratch was created in the middle of the well with a
sterile 200µl tip, and the media was replaced with the
respective treatments. Micrographs were collected at 0
and 24 hours. The pixel distance between the gaps was
measured at a predetermined point at each time point. The

the OCR measurements included oligomycin at a final
concentration of 1µM as the first injection. The second
injection was the electron transport chain stimulator,
carbonilcyanide
p-triflouromethoxyphenylhydrazone
(FCCP) at a final concentration of 250 nM. The final
injection was a combination of 2 inhibitors, Antimycin

The first compound used for the ECAR measurement
was glucose at a final concentration of 10 mM followed
by oligomycin at a final concentration of 2 µM. The last
injection was 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), a glucose analog
which interrupts glycolysis, at a final concentration of 100
mM [95]. Data obtained was normalized with cell number
counts.

The Mouse Cancer PathwayFinder™ RT² Profiler™
PCR array (SA Biosciences, Valencia, CA, USA) was
performed to obtain the expression profiles of 84 genes
pertaining to 9 cancer pathways. ID8 cells were treated
under various experimental conditions for 24 hours and
processed for RNA isolation. An equal amount of RNA (2
µg) was used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA)
using RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)
and cDNA was applied to the PCR Array plate along with
RT master mix. PCR was run in BIO RAD CFX96TM real
time PCR instrument (Hercules, CA, USA) and data was
analyzed using web based RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data
Analysis software (http://pcrdataanalysis.sabiosciences.

housekeeping genes (glucuronidase β, HPRT1
[hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1], HSP90
alpha [heat shock protein], GAPDH [glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase] and β-actin) were included
in the array to minimize functional biases.
