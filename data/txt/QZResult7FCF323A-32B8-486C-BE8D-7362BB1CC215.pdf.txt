Abstract
The antibody trastuzumab is approved for treatment of patients with HER2 (ERBB2)-overexpressing breast
cancer. A signiﬁcant fraction of these tumors are either intrinsically resistant or acquire resistance rendering the
drug ineffective. The development of resistance has been attributed to failure of the antibody to inhibit
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is activated by the HER2 network. Herein, we examined the effects
of PI3K blockade in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL147
and trastuzumab reduced proliferation and pAKT levels, triggering apoptosis of trastuzumab-resistant cells.
Compared with XL147 alone, the combination exhibited a superior antitumor effect against trastuzumabresistant tumor xenografts. Furthermore, treatment with XL147 and trastuzumab reduced the cancer stem-cell
(CSC) fraction within trastuzumab-resistant cells both in vitro and in vivo. These effects were associated with
FoxO-mediated inhibition of transcription of the antiapoptosis gene survivin (BIRC5) and the CSC-associated
cytokine interleukin-8. RNA interference–mediated or pharmacologic inhibition of survivin restored sensitivity to
trastuzumab in resistant cells. In a cohort of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer treated with
trastuzumab, higher pretreatment tumor levels of survivin RNA correlated with poor response to therapy.
Together, our results suggest that survivin blockade is required for therapeutic responses to trastuzumab and that
by combining trastuzumab and PI3K inhibitors, CSCs can be reduced within HER2þ tumors, potentially
preventing acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Cancer Res; 73(3); 1190–200. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The HER2 oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is ampliﬁed in approximately 20% of
invasive breast cancers (1). HER2 gene ampliﬁcation in breast
cancer is associated with increased cell proliferation and
motility, tumor invasion and metastasis, accelerated angiogenesis, decreased apoptosis, and resistance to anticancer
therapy (2). This translates into shorter disease-free and overall
survival in patients (3). In HER2-overexpressing cells, HER2
dimerizes with its coreceptor HER3 that, in turn, directly
couples to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K) and activates the PI3K/AKT survival pathway
(4–6).
Trastuzumab, a humanized antibody directed against the
extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor, is approved for the

treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer (7). Mechanisms of action of the antibody include endocytosis and downregulation of HER2, inhibition of ligand-independent HER2HER3 dimers with subsequent inhibition of PI3K/AKT, and
induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, trastuzumab engages Fc receptor–expressing immune effector
host cells to induce antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; reviewed in ref. 8).
Although patients with metastatic HER2þ breast cancer
respond clinically to single-agent trastuzumab or in combination with chemotherapy, virtually all patients eventually adapt
to the anti-HER2 therapy and progress (reviewed in ref. 9). One
of the major proposed mechanisms of adaptation or resistance
to trastuzumab involves aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT
pathway by (i) loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and
tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN; ref. 10) and (ii)
activating mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the
p110a catalytic subunit of PI3K (11). The dependence of
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells on the PI3K/AKT
pathway together with several genetic and epigenetic alternations in the PI3K pathway associated with trastuzumab
resistance suggest that early use of PI3K pathway inhibitors
should be useful in preventing or delaying clinical resistance
to trastuzumab. Indeed, several PI3K inhibitors have been
shown to block growth of preclinical models of trastuzumab
resistance (12, 13) and are currently the focus of clinical
development in patients with breast cancers (reviewed in
ref. 14).

PI3K Inhibition Sensitizes Trastuzumab-Resistant Cells

In this study, we used breast cancer models of trastuzumab
resistance with different modes of aberrant PI3K pathway
activation to examine the effects of ATP-mimetic, small-molecule inhibitors of PI3K either alone or in combination with
trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the panPI3K inhibitor XL147 (15) with or without trastuzumab
reduced proliferation and pAKT levels and induced apoptosis
of trastuzumab-resistant cells. The combination potently
inhibited trastuzumab-resistant xenografts established in
athymic mice. Treatment with XL147 alone or in combination
with trastuzumab modulated the cancer stem cell (CSC)
fraction, which has been causally associated with drug resistance and tumor recurrences (16). Pharmacologic and
RNA interference (RNAi)-based approaches suggested this
was, at least in part, due to derepression of FoxO-mediated
transcription that, in turn, downregulated expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and the antiapoptosis protein survivin. Finally,
in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer treated
with trastuzumab, higher pretreatment tumor levels of survivin RNA correlated with poor response to therapy. Taken
together, these data suggest that (i) trastuzumab-resistant
cells continue to rely on HER2-PI3K-FoxO-survivin axis for
survival, and (ii) modulation of this axis with a combination of
PI3K and HER2 inhibitors may abrogate or delay the development of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, inhibitors, plasmids, and viral
vectors
All cell lines were from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC), maintained in ATCC-recommended media
plus 10% FBS (Gibco) and authenticated by short tandem
repeat proﬁling using Sanger sequencing (March 2011). HR5
and HR6 cells were derived from previously described BT474
xenografts with acquired resistance to continuous treatment
with trastuzumab (17). WST-1 reagent and Caspase-Glo 3/7
assay kit were obtained from Roche Applied Science and
Promega Corporation, respectively. The following inhibitors
were used: lapatinib and BEZ235 (LC Laboratories), BKM120
(Active Biochem), YM155 (Selleck Chemicals), trastuzumab
(VUMC Pharmacy), and XL147 (Exelixis). The FHRE-Luc
reporter plasmid (Addgene plasmid#1789) has been described
previously (18). The Renilla Luc pRL-SV40 and human survivin
cDNA-pJP1520 were obtained from Promega and Labome/
DNASU plasmid repository, respectively. Retrovirus and stable
cell line production were described previously (19). Adenoviruses encoding b-galactosidase/LacZ, non-phoshorylatable
FKHRL1/FoxO3(AAA) mutant and dominant-negative/
dnFoxO3, both GFP-tagged, were from Vector Biolabs. Adenovirus infection was conducted as described previously (20).
Cell proliferation, immunoprecipitation, immunoblot
analysis, RNA interference, and real-time quantitative
PCR
These methods were conducted as described previously (21).
Human FoxO1 and FoxO3a siRNAs were described previously
(22). The p110a, p110b, and survivin siRNA duplexes were

www.aacrjournals.org

obtained from Ambion and Cell Signaling Technology. Primers
for quantitative PCR (qPCR) were obtained from Qiagen.
Mammosphere and aldehyde dehydrogenase assays
For mammosphere assay, 0.5  104 to 1  104 cells/well were
seeded in 6-well Ultra-low attachment plates (Costar) in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagles' Media (DMEM):F12 þ 20 ng/mL
EGF þ 1 B-27 serum-free supplement (Invitrogen). Imaging
and quantitation of colonies were done in GelCount colony
counter (Oxford Optronix). Mammospheres were dissociated
by trypsin digestion, and 1,000 cells/well were seeded in 6-well
plates in IMEM/10% serum (Fig. 4J). Focus/colony formation
was assessed 7 days later. Colonies were ﬁxed and stained with
methanol crystal violet and imaged. Aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) assay was conducted with ALDEFLUOR kit (Stemcell
Technologies) and subsequent ﬂuorescence-activated cellsorting (FACS) analysis in a 3 laser LSRII (BD Biosciences).
Dual luciferase reporter assay
Cells were transfected with 10 mg FHRE-Luc (18) plus 100 ng
pRL-SV40 with FuGENE 6 (Promega) and treated overnight
with trastuzumab, XL147, or both. Dual luciferase assay was
conducted with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega).
Proteome Proﬁler human angiogenesis and phosphoRTK arrays
Angiogenesis (ARY007) and pRTK (ARY001) arrays were
conducted according to manufacturer's instructions (R&D
Systems).
Xenograft studies
These were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
Committee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN). A 17bestradiol pellet (Innovative Research of America) was injected
subcutaneously in the dorsum of 4- to 5-week-old athymic
female mouse (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.). Next day, HR6
cells (3  106) mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were
injected s.c. into the right ﬂank of each mouse. Tumor diameters were measured twice a week and volume in mm3
calculated by the formula: volume ¼ width2  length/2. Mice
with 200 mm3 tumors were randomized to vehicle, trastuzumab (30 mg/kg twice a week intraperitoneally), XL147 (100
mg/kg daily per os), or combination treatments for 28 days.
Immunostaining and histoscore (H-score) analysis of formalinﬁxed tumor sections harvested on day 28 were conducted as
described previously (22).

Results
Trastuzumab-resistant cells remain dependent on PI3K
We treated a panel of trastuzumab-resistant HER2 gene–
ampliﬁed human breast cancer cells with the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL147 (15) and the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 (23), either alone
or in combination with trastuzumab. The HR5 and HR6 cell
lines, derived from BT474 xenografts, grew in presence of
trastuzumab in vivo and overexpress EGFR/HER3 ligands
(17). The HCC1954 and SUM190 cell lines contain a mutation

apoptosis measured by activation of caspase-3/7 (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
We next examined the effect of XL147, trastuzumab, and the
combination on activated AKT, a main downstream target of
PI3K (Fig. 2A). In all cell lines, treatment with XL147 alone or
in combination with trastuzumab reduced pAKTS473 and
pAKTT308 levels (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of PI3K/AKT is counteracted by compensatory feedback activation of RTKs, including
HER3 (22, 25). In HER2-dependent breast cancer cells and
xenografts, this compensation is reduced by cotreatment with
trastuzumab or the HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
lapatinib (22). To determine whether a similar phenomenon
occurs in trastuzumab-resistant cells, we hybridized lysates of
cells treated with XL147  trastuzumab with arrays representing 42 different phosphorylated RTKs. The combination of
XL147 þ trastuzumab resulted in a modest reduction in
pEGFR, pHER2, and pHER3 levels compared with XL147 alone
(Fig. 2B; arrows).
In all 3 trastuzumab-resistant lines, treatment with both
inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of VEGFR1 and/or

in the catalytic domain (H1047R) of PIK3CA and HCC1569 cells
are PTEN-null (22, 24). Treatment with XL147 þ trastuzumab
but not CI-1040 þ trastuzumab inhibited monolayer (Fig. 1A)
and 3-dimensional growth (Fig. 1B) in all resistant lines. CI1040 alone was inactive against all cell lines, whereas growth of
3 of 5 resistant lines (HR5, HR6, and HCC1569) was inhibited by
XL147, suggesting they depend on the PI3K/AKT pathway. The
combination of XL147 and trastuzumab induced cell death and
growth arrest as supported by immunoblot analysis of cleaved
caspase-3 and PARP (apoptosis) and CDK inhibitor p27Kip1
(cell-cycle arrest; ref. Fig. 1C). This was further conﬁrmed by
enhanced caspase-3/7 activity following treatment with XL147
þ trastuzumab compared with each inhibitor alone (Fig. 1D).
The PI3K dependence of trastuzumab-resistant cells was also
supported by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the p110a and
p110b subunits of PI3K (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Compared
with the cells transfected with control siRNA and treated with
trastuzumab, knockdown of both p110a and p110b resulted in
greater inhibition of cell growth in both monolayer and in 3dimensional (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) as well as

Related to this ﬁnding, trastuzumab has been shown to act as
an antiangiogenic agent by affecting different proangiogenic
proteins including VEGF and angiopoietin (26). Thus, we
examined the effect of XL147  trastuzumab on the expression
of 55 angiogenic growth factors by hybridizing HR6 and
HCC1954 cell lysates with protein arrays. In both cell lines,
only the combination of XL147 þ trastuzumab, but not each
drug alone, reduced the expression of VEGF (Fig. 2C). Several

subsequent IL-8 qPCR. Each bar represents the mean  SE of triplicates. F, luciferase activity was measured in HCC1954 and HR6 cells transiently
transfected with a FoxO promoter-reporter (FHRE-Luc) and treated with DMSO, XL147 (6 mmol/L: HR6; 10 mmol/L: HCC1954), trastuzumab (10 mg/mL), or
XL147 þ trastuzumab. Each bar represents mean  SE of 6 replicates. G, HR5 and HCC1954 cells were transfected with control or FoxO1 and FoxO3 siRNA
oligonucleotides as described previously (22). Three days later, the cells were harvested for RNA extraction followed by determination of IL-8, FoxO1, and 3
mRNA levels by qPCR. Each bar represents mean  SE of triplicates.

(Fig. 2D), suggesting the effect of XL147 on VEGF transcription
was PI3K pathway–speciﬁc and not an off-target drug effect.
Treatment with PI3K inhibitor and trastuzumab reduces
the drug-resistant CSC fraction
It has been proposed that the clinical efﬁcacy of trastuzumab is due to its ability to target CSCs within trastuzumabsensitive tumors (30, 31). CSC activity is studied in vitro by
primary mammosphere formation (attachment-independent
growth) and analysis of speciﬁc cell surface markers (32).
ALDH positivity (ALDHþ) correlates with HER2þ subtypes
independent of estrogen receptor (ER) status (30, 33). More
recently, the inﬂammatory cytokine IL-8 has also been directly
associated with mammosphere formation and ALDH positivity
in breast CSCs (34). Thus, we measured the sensitivity of the
CSC fraction to combined inhibition of PI3K and HER2 by
mammosphere formation, ALDH activity, and IL-8 expression.
Treatment with trastuzumab alone reduced mammosphere

formation, ALDH activity, and IL-8 mRNA expression in trastuzumab-sensitive BT474 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The
trastuzumab-resistant HR5 and HR6 cell lines contained a
higher proportion of CSCs as indicated by greater ability to
form mammospheres, enhanced ALDH activity, and higher
levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein (Supplementary Fig. S3B). In
these cells, the combination of XL147 þ trastuzumab reduced
mammosphere formation (Fig. 3A), IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 3B), and
ALDH activity (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Treatment of
HCC1954 cells with BKM120 and BEZ235, each alone and in
combination with trastuzumab, reduced mammosphere formation, ALDH activity, and IL-8 expression, suggesting the
effects were speciﬁed to the PI3K pathway (Fig. 3C–E). Finally,
RNAi of p110a also reduced the CSC fraction in HCC1954 cells
as measured by a decrease in mammosphere growth and
ALDH activity (Supplementary Fig. S3E–S3G).
In epithelial and endothelial cells, FoxO1 and FoxO3 have
been implicated as suppressors of IL-8 transcription (35, 36).

FoxO1 and FoxO3 activities are regulated by AKT-mediated
phosphorylation. When AKT is inactive, FoxO factors are
hypophosphorylated and predominantly nuclear where they
modulate the transcription of target genes (37). We speculated that in trastuzumab-resistant cells, the combination of
XL147 and trastuzumab, but not each drug alone, would
optimally suppress PI3K-AKT resulting in FoxO-mediated
suppression of IL-8 transcription. Indeed, the combination
of XL147 and trastuzumab induced maximal activity of a
FoxO3 promoter reporter transfected into HCC1954 and HR6
cells compared with each inhibitor alone (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, transfection of FoxO1 and FoxO3 siRNA duplexes into
trastuzumab-resistant HR5 and HCC1954 cells resulted in
a 2- and 3.5-fold upregulation of IL-8 mRNA, respectively
(Fig. 3G).
Treatment with PI3K inhibitor and trastuzumab reduces
survivin expression
To investigate mediators of the apoptosis induced by the
combination of XL147 and trastuzumab in drug-resistant cells
(Fig. 1C and D), we next examined levels of the proapoptotic
molecule BIM and the antiapoptotic molecules X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), survivin, BCL2, and
MCL1. By immunoblot analysis, only survivin, a member of
the inhibitor of apoptosis/IAP family of antiapoptotic proteins
(38), was downregulated in all cell lines upon treatment
with XL147 þ trastuzumab (Fig. 4A). Protein levels correlated
with a change in survivin mRNA levels (Fig. 4B). Steady-state
levels of survivin mRNA were similar between trastuzumabsensitive (BT474) and -resistant (HR5 and HR6) cells (Fig. 4C,
left; qPCR). However, in antibody-sensitive cells, treatment
with trastuzumab inhibited survivin mRNA (qPCR) and protein (immunoblot) levels (Fig. 4C, right), whereas in the resistant cells, the antibody had no effect (Fig. 4A and B). In
HCC1954 cells, BKM120 and BEZ235 each in combination with
trastuzumab also reduced survivin mRNA levels (Fig. 4D),
suggesting that survivin transcription is regulated by the PI3K
pathway.
FoxO factors inhibit survivin gene transcription through
direct interaction with its promoter (39, 40). Accordingly,
siRNA knockdown of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in trastuzumab-resistant cells resulted in a 2-fold increase in survivin mRNA (Fig.
4E). Furthermore, in BT474 cells, RNAi of FoxO1/3 counteracted the XL147 þ trastuzumab-mediated suppression of
survivin protein levels (Fig. 4F). In addition, overexpression
of a constitutively active mutant of FoxO3, where the 3 AKT
phosphorylation sites had been substituted with Ala [FoxO3
(AAA)], reduced survivin protein levels (Fig. 4G) and BT474 cell
growth and mammosphere formation (Fig. 4I and J). In a
reverse experiment, transduction of a dominant-negative
FoxO3, where the C-terminal transactivation domain has been
deleted (dnFoxO3), resulted in a modest increase in survivin
protein levels in BT474 cells (Fig. 4H). These data suggest that
survivin expression is regulated by PI3K-FoxO in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.
RNAi of FoxO1/3 partially rescued the reduction of IL-8
levels upon treatment with the combination of XL147 þ
trastuzumab (Fig. 4F). Conversely, BT474 cells transduced with

1196

Cancer Res; 73(3) February 1, 2013

the constitutively active FoxO3 mutant exhibited reduced IL-8
expression (Fig. 4G), whereas dominant-negative FoxO3 had
the opposite effect (Fig. 4H).
Downregulation of survivin restores sensitivity to
trastuzumab
On the basis of the results shown in Fig. 4, we speculated that
downregulation of survivin is required for the apoptosis
induced by the combination of XL147 þ trastuzumab in cells
resistant to the antibody. Indeed, downregulation of survivin
with RNAi (Fig. 5B) or with YM155, a small-molecule inhibitor
of survivin transcription (41), in trastuzumab-resistant cells
resulted in growth inhibition (Fig. 5A and C, top) and apoptosis
(Fig. 5C, bottom and Supplementary Fig. S4A, B, and D). A
second survivin siRNA oligonucleotide produced comparable
levels of knockdown, apoptosis, and growth inhibition in
HCC1954 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). Conversely,
overexpression of survivin cDNA in drug-sensitive BT474 cells
attenuated trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S4G).
Survivin has been reported to play a role in maintenance of
CSCs (42, 43). Thus, we next tested whether genetic and/or
pharmacologic inhibition of survivin would have an effect on
the CSC fraction within trastuzumab-resistant cells. In HR5
and HCC1954 cells, RNAi-mediated knockdown of survivin
decreased mammosphere formation; this was further reduced
when the RNAi oligonucleotides were combined with trastuzumab (Fig. 5D). Treatment with YM155 alone or in combination with trastuzumab also reduced mammosphere formation
(Fig. 5E). These effects correlated temporally with reduction in
ALDH activity (Supplementary Fig. S4H and S4I).
Combination of PI3K inhibitor and trastuzumab inhibits
growth of trastuzumab-resistant xenografts
On the basis of its superior ability to decrease survivin levels,
we proposed that the combination of trastuzumab þ XL147
would be a more potent inhibitor of trastuzumab-resistant
xenograft growth compared with the PI3K inhibitor alone.
Athymic mice bearing HR6 xenografts of 200 mm3 were
randomized to therapy with vehicle, XL147, trastuzumab, or
the combination of both inhibitors. Each drug alone modestly
delayed HR6 tumor growth, whereas the combination of both
inhibitors induced a marked antitumor effect (Fig. 6A). We
next examined pharmacodynamic biomarkers of drug target
inactivation after 28 days of treatment by immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time qPCR (qRT-PCR), and immunoblot analyses. AKT activity has been shown to correlate directly with
both cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of pAKTS473 (44). Consistent with the antitumor effect observed, only the combination
of XL147 þ trastuzumab reduced both cytoplasmic and nuclear pAKT levels (Fig. 6B, top). CD31 positivity (indicative of
vessel formation/angiogenesis) and ALDH1 levels by IHC and
IL-8 mRNA levels by qPCR were also lower in tumors treated
with the combination (Figs. 6B, bottom, and D). Finally, only
the combination reduced survivin levels as measured by
immunoblot analysis of tumor lysates (Fig. 6C). These results
were further veriﬁed in mice bearing HCC1954 xenografts
treated with vehicle, trastuzumab, XL147, and the combination

of both drugs for 1 week. There was a noticeable decrease IL-8
and survivin expression (Supplementary Fig. S5) in tumors
treated with the combination compared with tumors treated
with each drug alone.
To support the clinical relevance of these data, we sought to
determine whether steady-state and/or treatment-induced
changes in survivin mRNA levels correlate with the response
to trastuzumab in patients. In this study, patients with HER2þ
breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab for 3 weeks,
followed by a combination of trastuzumab þ docetaxel for
12 weeks before surgery (45). Survivin mRNA was measured by
microarray analysis in RNA extracted from tumor core biopsies
obtained before therapy and from the surgical specimen after
completion of the 4-month treatment. Evaluable matched
microarray data were available in 13 patients. Five of 13
patients exhibited a response to treatment deﬁned as absence

of any invasive cancer or only residual cancer of <0.1 cm in
diameter in the surgical specimen (45). There was a signiﬁcant
reduction in survivin mRNA levels in the posttreatment compared with the pretreatment biopsies (P ¼ 0.0062; Fig. 6E).
Furthermore, pretreatment biopsies from patients exhibiting
no response expressed signiﬁcantly higher levels of survivin
mRNA than those patients who responded clinically (P ¼
0.026; Fig. 6F) These data suggest that baseline levels and
treatment-induced changes in survivin expression can potentially serve as a predictive biomarker of anti-HER2 therapy
action in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

Discussion
The antitumor action of trastuzumab depends, in part, on its
ability to downregulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

against HER2-dependent xenografts (26). We observed that in
drug-resistant xenografts, the combination of XL147 and trastuzumab reduced VEGF protein content and RNA expression,
VEGF receptor phosphorylation, and blood vessel formation
more potently than each drug alone (Figs. 2B–D and 6B),
suggesting that PI3K-dependent enhanced angiogenesis is
associated with resistance to trastuzumab.
Metastatic tumor relapses are characterized by rapidly
proliferating, drug-resistant cancers associated with a high
mortality rate. An increasing body of evidence suggests that
survival of a small population of cells with stem-like properties
may be responsible for these tumor recurrences after an initial
response to anticancer therapy. This population, interchangeably called CSCs or "tumor-initiating cells" (TIC), retains the
capacity to self-renew and regenerate the total bulk of a
heterogeneous tumor comprised mostly of non-stem cells.
Therefore, to achieve cures, both CSCs and non-CSCs within
a given tumor should be eliminated (46). It has been proposed
that in HER2þ tumors, PI3K/AKT signaling increases the CSC

Persistent activation of this pathway has been shown to confer
resistance to trastuzumab (reviewed in ref. 8). Despite the
increasing availability of therapeutic inhibitors of the PI3K/
AKT/TOR pathway (reviewed in ref. 14) and abundant preclinical data linking this pathway with drug resistance, few
mechanistic studies have examined the role of these inhibitors
in trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer cells. We report herein the cellular, biochemical, and molecular effects of the ATPcompetitive, reversible PI3K inhibitor XL147 against a panel of
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines and xenografts.
The superior antiproliferative and antitumor action of XL147
in combination with trastuzumab concurred with its ability to
promote cell death and cell-cycle arrest (Figs. 1 and 6A) and
reduce AKT phosphorylation both in vitro (Fig. 2A) and in vivo
(Fig. 6B).
HER2/PI3K/AKT signaling potently induces expression of
the proangiogenic factor VEGF (2). Treatment with trastuzumab reduces tumor VEGF in vivo, and this effect has been
proposed to be central to the antitumor action of the antibody

fraction required for tumor progression (30). Indeed, treatment
with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction in drug-sensitive
BT474 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and xenografts (Fig. 6B).
Conversely, this was not observed in antibody-resistant HR5,
HR6, and HCC1954 cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3C).
However, treatment with the PI3K inhibitor and trastuzumab
reduced CSCs in trastuzumab-resistant tumors (Figs. 3 and 6B
and Supplementary Fig. S3C–S3G) while decreasing expression
of IL-8, a cytokine that depends on FoxO transcription factors
(Figs. 3B and G, 4F–H, and 6D) and that promotes maintenance
of CSCs (47). These data suggest that the reduction of CSCs is
associated with restoration of sensitivity to the anti-HER2
therapy.
Cell death induced by anticancer therapies is triggered by
drug-induced modulation of endogenous levels of pro- and
antiapoptotic proteins. In the case of anti-HER2 therapies, this
is the result of drug-induced downregulation of the PI3K/AKT
and RAS/MEK/ERK pathways (48). The proapoptotic effects
of the combination of XL147 and trastuzumab in trastuzumabresistant cells and xenografts correlated temporally with transcriptional inhibition of survivin, a member of the IAP family.
High survivin expression has been associated with high nuclear
grade, negative hormone receptor status, HER2 and VEGF
overexpression, and worse disease-free or overall survival in
breast cancer (49). In this study, inhibition of survivin function
with either siRNA or a small-molecule inhibitor reduced CSCs
and non-CSCS in trastuzumab-resistant cells (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4), further suggesting a causal association of
survivin expression with drug resistance. Similar to the effect
on IL-8, the transcriptional repression of survivin also
depended on FoxO factors (Fig. 4). Finally, high levels of
survivin mRNA in HER2þ tumors correlated with a poor
clinical response to trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant therapy (Fig. 6F). These data suggest that in HER2þ tumors with
high levels of survivin, a more sustained and comprehensive
inhibition of the HER2/PI3K axis, perhaps with the addition of
a PI3K pathway inhibitor, will be required to suppress expres-

sion of this antiapoptotic protein. In sum, we conclude that
acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapies and subsequent
metastatic progression of HER2-overexpressing cancers can be
signiﬁcantly ameliorated by early combinations of drugs that
simultaneously target the HER2 receptor and the PI3K
pathway.
