Abstract

Author Manuscript

DNA damage is a deleterious threat, but occurs daily in all types of cells. In response to DNA
damage, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a unique posttranslational modification, is immediately
catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) at DNA lesions, which facilitates DNA
damage repair. Recent studies suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is one of the first steps of
cellular DNA damage response and governs early DNA damage response pathways. Suppression
of DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP inhibitors impairs early DNA damage
response events. Moreover, PARP inhibitors are emerging as anti-cancer drugs in phase III clinical
trials for BRCA-deficient tumors. In this review, we discuss recent findings on poly(ADPribosyl)ation in DNA damage response as well as the molecular mechanism by which PARP
inhibitors selectively kill tumor cells with BRCA mutations.

Review

Author Manuscript

Both environmental and internal hazards induce lesions in genomic DNA1. If not repaired,
DNA lesions will induce genomic instability and ultimately cause tumorigenesis.
Fortunately, DNA damage response system recognizes and repairs DNA lesions, which
protects genomic stability and suppresses tumorigenesis2, 3. Accumulated evidence suggests
that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a crucial part of DNA damage response system for sensing of
DNA lesions, activation of DNA damage response pathways, and facilitating DNA damage
repair4, 5.
Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been identified for 50 years6, 7. The process of poly(ADPribosyl)ation is catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs)8–10. Using NAD+ as
the donor, mono-ADP-ribose is covalently linked to the side chains of arginine, lysine,
aspartate, and glutamate residues of target proteins by PARPs. After catalyzing the first
ADP-ribose on the proteins, other ADP-ribose can be covalently linked onto the first ADP-

ribose and the continuous reactions produce both linear and branched polymers, known as
poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)5, 11. The structure of PAR has been well characterized for many
years: the ADP-ribose units in the polymer are linked by glycosidic ribose-ribose 1′–2′
bonds, and the chain length is heterogeneous, which can reach around 200 units, with 20–50
ADP-ribose units in each branch12–14 (Fig. 1). Accumulated evidence shows that DNA
damage induces massive synthesis of PAR in a very short period15, 16. In this review, we
summarize the recent findings of this dynamic posttranslational modification in DNA
damage response, and discuss the possible molecular mechanism of PARP inhibitors in
cancer treatment.

Metabolism of PAR during DNA damage response

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Although the cellular concentration of NAD+ is around 0.3 – 1 mM, the basal level of
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is very low15, 17. However, following genotoxic stress, level of
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation increases 10- to 1000-fold in a few seconds15–18, which could
consume up to 75% of cellular NAD+15, 18. Since NAD+ is a key coenzyme in many
biological processes such as glucose and fatty acid metabolism, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may
transiently suppress these biochemical reactions immediately following DNA damage. The
DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is mainly catalyzed by PARP1, 2 and 3,
although seventeen PARPs have been identified on the basis of homologous information to
the funding member PARP14, 11, 19. With the enzymatic activity significantly higher than
the other members in vitro, PARP1 is believed to make the major contribution to DNA
damage-induced PAR synthesis in vivo4, 18. PARP1 is a 116-kDa protein, consisting of three
functional domains, namely N-terminal DNA-binding domain, automodification domain,
and C-terminal catalytic domains5, 20 (Fig. 2). The DNA-binding domain includes three zinc
fingers that are required for the interaction with DNA breaks21, 22. Once the DNA-binding
domain recognizes DNA breaks, it induces the conformational changes of C-terminal
catalytic domain to expose the activation site to NAD+, and activates the enzymatic
activity23. Of note, a BRCA1 carboxy-terminal (BRCT) motif is also found in this
automodification domain, although its function is still elusive5, 20. The BRCT motif is
known as the phospho-group binding domain and is usually involved in DNA damage
response24–27. The existence of the BRCT motif may imply an unidentified role of PARP1
especially in DNA damage response. Besides auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, PARP1 also
induces histone poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation at vicinity of DNA lesions, which may facilitate
chromatin remodeling in response to DNA damage28, 29.

The massive DNA damage-induced PAR synthesis consumes huge amount of NAD+15, 18,
which is not sustainable for cells if NAD+ is depleted for the prolonged time. It has been
shown that the half-life of DNA damage-induced PAR is between 40 s to 6 min15, 30–33.
PAR is quickly hydrolyzed into free ADP-ribose (ADPr) that is probably recycled back to
NAD+. The best studied PAR-degrading enzyme is poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase
(PARG)34, which possesses both endoglycosidic and exoglycosidic activities and therefore
generates free ADPr from PAR35, 36. In mammals, several isoforms of PARG from a single
PARG gene have been identified4, 11. The full length 110kDa-PARG mainly localizes in
nucleus while other short forms of PARG exist in cytoplasm36, 37. Following DNA damageinduced PAR synthesis, PARG is recruited to DNA lesions and breaks 1′–2′ glycosic bonds

between two riboses38, 39. However, PARG cannot remove the last ADP-ribose linking to
the amino acid residue40, 41. Recent studies suggest that several other enzymes including
TARG, Macro D1 and Macro D2 could remove the last ADP-ribose residue42–44. In
particular, TARG mainly localizes in nucleus, and is likely to function with PARG to
degrade DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation44.

PAR-dependent chromatin remodeling during DNA damage response

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The major substrates of DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation are PARP1 itself and
histones including nucleosomal histones and linker histones surrounding DNA lesions11, 28.
Over the past few decades, PAR is known to be covalently linked to arginine, glutamate or
aspartate residues of acceptor proteins45. The identification of lysine as an acceptor site on
PARP2 and histone tails updated the convention concept of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by ester
linkage46, 47. Recent proteomic analyses with various enrichment approaches further reveal
the in vivo poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation sites. For example, Zhang et al. used boronate beads to
enrich the substrates and identified novel poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation sites48. Jungmichel et al.
dissected poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated targets by affinity purification using a bacterial PARbinding domain49. Also, using phosphoproteomic approach, two other groups have mapped
auto-ADP-ribosylation sites of PARP150 and mono/poly- ADP-ribosylation sites from
whole cell lysates51. Interestingly, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a unique chromatin
modification as each ADP-ribose residue contains two phosphate groups carrying two
negative charges, so that the polymer brings a large amount of negative charges to the
damaged chromatin4, 11, 52. Since genomic DNA has the same negative charges, PAR
relaxes chromatin by electron repel. Besides its own chemical property, PAR regulates
chromatin remodeling through its binding partners. To date, PAR is recognized by several
modules including the PBZ, Macro, RRM, BRCT, FHA and OB-fold domains32, 33, 53–59.
CHD4, a PBZ domain containing protein, is a subunit in the histone deacetylase NuRD
complex60, 61. It has been shown that CHD4 is recruited by PAR in response to DNA
damage and facilitates the loading of the NuRD complex for DNA damage-induced
chromatin remodeling, which may indirectly impact DNA damage repair62. Another
example is ALC1, a DNA helicase with a Macro domain. Upon binding PAR, the helicase
activity of ALC1 is activated, which induces nucleosomes sliding away from DNA damage
sites63, 64. Thus, PAR mediates chromatin remodeling at DNA lesions through both its own
chemical properties and its binding partners.

The role of PAR in DNA single-strand damage repair
Author Manuscript

Besides the role in DNA damage-induced chromatin remodeling, PARP1 is a major sensor
to detect DNA single-strand lesions and participates in DNA damage repair65–68 (Fig. 3).
Numerous DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) (breakage in the sugar-phosphate backbone of
one strand of a DNA helix), are induced daily by various types of environmental and
internal hazards in every cell. If not repaired timely, SSBs can be converted into DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs), a more lethal type of DNA lesion69, 70. SSBs can be generated
directly by disintegration of DNA backbone or arise as a result of erroneous activity of
cellular enzymes such as DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) 69, 71. SSBs can also be indirectly
induced during the base excision repair (BER)72, 73. This process is initiated by DNA

glycosylases, which recognize and remove damaged bases, forming apurinic/apyrimidinic
sites (AP sites). These sites are then cleaved by an AP endonuclease to generate SSBs for
DNA patching74. These lesion-induced SSBs are repaired by a general process including
four steps: SSB detection, DNA end processing, DNA gap filling, and DNA ligation70.
During the process, SSBs are detected by PARPs (mainly by PARP1), and the interaction
between the DNA nicks and PARPs triggers massive synthesis of PAR at the sites of
SSBs68, 70. The SSB-induced PAR is recognized by X-ray repair cross-complementing
protein 1 (XRCC1), one of the core factors in SSBs repair 75. Previous studies have shown
that XRCC1 has high affinity to PAR both in vitro and in vivo, and the interaction is
required for the rapid recruitment of XRCC1 to the sites of SSBs32, 76, 77. As a scaffold,
XRCC1 interacts with and stabilizes other SSB repair machineries75, 78, 79. More recently,
polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase (PNKP), aprataxin (APTX) and aprataxin and PNKlike factor (APLF) were found to recognize PAR too32, 53, 54. All of them are important
enzymes for the SSB repair. PNKP has been shown to possess 3′-DNA phosphatase and 5′DNA kinase activity and can thus restore normal termini from DNA lesions with 3′phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl end groups80, 81. These enzymatic activities of PNKP facilitate
DNA end ligation by DNA ligase III70. APTX catalyzes the nucleophilic release of
adenylate groups covalently linked to 5′-phosphate termini at single-strand nicks and gaps,
which is generated during aborted ligation. This activity produces 5′-phosphate termini for
efficiently rejoining82. For APLF, it has an AP endonuclease activity as well as a 3′–5′
exonuclease activity for DNA end resection83. Thus, PARP1 senses the ends of SSBs and
synthesizes PAR at DNA lesions. Damage-induced PAR functions as the earliest alarm and
targets at least XRCC1, PNKP, APTX and APLF to SSBs for the repair.

Besides BER, nucleotide excision repair (NER) also generates SSBs84. Accumulated
evidence suggests that PARP1 participates in NER, a repair mechanism for bulky DNA
adducts, such as UV-induced thymine dimer and 6,4-photoproducts85. Similar to BER,
damaged bases are recognized and removed to expose single-strand ends during NER86.
However, compared with BER, a relatively long patch of single-stranded DNA containing
the lesions is removed. The undamaged single-stranded DNA in the helix is used as the
template for the synthesis of the complementary strand by DNA polymerases86, 87. Although
the detailed function of PAR in NER is not clear, it has been shown that UV induces
massive poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and auto poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 is associated with
specific NER machineries such as XPA and DDB276, 88, which facilitates the recruitment of
the chromatin-remodeling enzyme ALC185.

The role of PAR in DNA double-strand break repair
Author Manuscript

Beside SSB repair, recent studies suggest that poly(ADP-ribosylation) also plays a key role
in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Compared with SSB, DSB is much more
deleterious. If not repaired, DSBs instantly induce the loss of partial genomic DNA or
chromosomal abnormal rearrangements that alter gene codes. It ultimately causes genomic
instability and tumorigenesis2, 89. To avoid genomic instability, cells have a sophisticated
DSB response system including checkpoint pathways and DSB repair pathways90, 91.
Poly(ADP-ribosylation) has been shown to regulate both DSB-induced checkpoint
activation and DSB repair.

PARP1 is one of the first proteins that directly recognize DSB ends22. Due to high
expression level of PARP1 in nucleoplasm4, 19, abundant PARP1 is able to scan genomic
DNA. Once DSB occurs, PARP1 reaches the sites of DNA damage within
milliseconds92, 93. Structural analysis has shown that the N-terminal three zinc fingers
coordinate together to recognize one DSB end and induces the conformational changes in
the catalytic domain for the activation of massive PAR synthesis22. The abundance and
rapid activation of PARP1 suggests that PARP1 is a key DNA damage sensor for DSB
response.

DSB-induced PAR is then recognized by PAR-binding proteins for both cell cycle
checkpoint activation and DSB repair. Recently, several novel PAR-binding modules,
including the BRCT, FHA and OB-fold domains, have been revealed32, 33, 57. Interestingly,
the BRCT and FHA domains are known as phospho-protein binding domain24, 25, 94–96. It
has been shown that a set of BRCT and FHA domains directly bind PAR and possibly
recognize phosphate groups in PAR32. Among these BRCT and FHA domain containing
proteins, NBS1 is important for cell cycle checkpoint activation32. NBS1 is a subunit in the
MRN complex that activates ATM in response to DSB97–99. ATM is a PI3-like kinase that
governs DSB-induced cell cycle checkpoint100, 101. Once DSBs occur, the BRCT domain of
NBS1 recognizes PAR at DNA lesions, which rapidly recruits the MRN complex to the sites
of DNA damage and facilitates the early activation of ATM-dependent signal transduction
pathway as well as cell cycle checkpoints32. Besides NBS1, hSSB1 is another PAR-binding
protein that may mediate early checkpoint activation57. hSSB1 is a subunit in the hSSBINTS complex, and contains a N-terminal OB-fold domain102. The OB-fold domain is
known to interact with single-stranded DNA/RNA103, 104. Recent study suggests that a set
of OB-fold domains, such as the OB-fold domain of hSSB1, prefer to bind PAR over oligo
nucleotide. The interaction between PAR and hSSB1 also facilitates the fast recruitment of
hSSB1 to the sites of DSBs57. It has been shown that hSSB1 plays an important role to
stabilize the MRN complex at DNA lesions105. Thus, it is possible that the hSSB-INTS
complex indirectly regulates ATM-dependent checkpoint activation through the MRN
complex.

Besides cell cycle checkpoint activation, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation also regulates DSB repair.
There are two well-studied DSB repair mechanisms, namely non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)2, 106. DNA damage-induced poly(ADPribosyl)ation regulates both NHEJ and HR. Among the NHEJ pathway, Ligase IV plays a
key role to religate DSB ends107. Recent evidence shows that the BRCT domain of Ligase
IV is a PAR-binding domain32. The interaction with PAR mediates the fast recruitment of
Ligase IV to DNA lesions, which is likely to promote quick NHEJ. Regarding HR, the
BRCA1/BARD1 complex is required for loading downstream HR repair machinery such as
RAD51 to DSBs108, 109. Like other BRCT domain, the BRCT domain of BARD1 directly
binds PAR at DNA lesions and mediates the fast recruitment of the BRCA1/BARD1
complex to DNA lesions33. The early DNA damage response mediates by the BRCA1/
BARD1 complex is likely to promote HR repair.
Collectively, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates both cell cycle checkpoint activation and
DSB repair. DNA damage-induced PAR is recognized by a lot of DNA damage response

factors, and mediates the fast recruitment of these factors to DNA lesions, which jumpstarts
DNA damage response pathways. Since most DNA damage-induced poly(ADPribosyl)ation events are mediated by PARP1, PARP1 is a bona fide DSB sensor. After
various DNA damage response pathways are activated, the high level of PAR begins to be
degraded by PARG, and DNA repair factors are selectively retained at DNA lesions through
other mechanisms such as DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination events
for fulfilling the DNA damage repair (Fig. 3).

PARP inhibitors in cancer chemotherapies

Since poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates DNA damage response, suppression of DNA
damage-induced PAR may sensitize tumor cells, especially DNA damage repair-deficient
tumor cells, to genotoxic stress. Thus, PARP inhibitors have been designed and tested for
cancer treatment20, 110, 111. Two explicit studies have shown that BRCA1 and BRCA2deficient tumor cells are hypersensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment112, 113. Germline
mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 induce hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, and account
for 5 ~ 10 % of total breast and ovarian cancers114, 115. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are
involved in HR repair and facilitate the loading of RAD51, the key enzyme for HR repair, to
DNA lesions109. Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 impair RAD51-dependent HR, induce
the accumulation of DNA lesions, lead to genomic instability, and eventually cause cell
malignant transformation116–118. It has been hypothesized that PARP inhibitors selectively
killing BRCA-deficient tumor cells through synthetic lethality approach119, 120. The
synthetic lethality concept was first proposed by Hartwell et al. in 1990s during their study
of anticancer drugs121. It described the condition in which defects in either one of two genes
individually had mild effect, but the lethality ensued when the defects in the two
combined122. Previous study on PARP inhibitor mainly focuses on its role in BER repair. It
has been shown that DNA lesions induced by endogenous metabolism or replication errors
result in SSBs that are repaired by the BER pathway. When PARPs are inhibited, the BER
pathway is suppressed. It induces the SSBs degraded to DSBs during replication. In HR
proficient cells, these DSBs would be repaired by HR. However, in absence of BRCA1,
BRCA2, or other HR machineries, failure of DSB repair induces cell apoptosis 123.
However, several questions on this model arise from recent studies: 1) Besides PARPs, other
enzymes also participate in SSB repair70. To date, it is unclear whether suppression of other
SSB repair machineries could also kill BRCA-deficient tumors. 2) Besides HR repair, NHEJ
is an alternative mechanism for DSB repair. Why couldn’t NHEJ compensate the loss of HR
during PARP inhibitor treatment? 3) Recent study suggests that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is
likely to play a much broader role in not only SSB repair but also DSB repair. The BRCA1/
BARD1 complex even directly recognize DNA damage-induced PAR33, suggesting that
PAR directly participates in BRCA1-dependent HR repair. 4) Phase II clinical trials suggest
that PARP inhibitors are effective for around 40 % of BRCA-deficient tumors110. There are
still ~ 60 % of patients who did not respond well to PARP inhibitor treatment. Thus, we
propose a new model of how PARP inhibitors selectively kill tumor cells with BRCA
mutations.

Recent findings in our laboratory show an important function of PAR in HR32, 33. We find
that BRCA1 is recruited to the sites of DNA damage by PAR and the PAR-dependent fast
recruitment of BRCA1 is required for HR33, 124. It has been shown that BRCA1 and
BARD1forms a complex through the Ring-Ring interaction125, 126. The BRCT domain of
BARD1 recognizes PAR and target the whole complex to DNA lesions in a few seconds
following DSBs. Under normal condition, PAR is degraded by PARG in a few minutes
following DSBs. But the BRCA1-BARD1 complex is still able to be retained at DNA
lesions because the BRCT domain of BRCA1 is a pSer-binding domain that recognizes
pSer406 of Abraxas/CCDC98 at DNA damage sites33, 124, 127, 128. Suppression of PAR
synthesis by PARP inhibitors abolishes the fast recruitment of the BRCA1-BARD1
complex. But through Abraxsa/CCDC98 and phosphorylation-dependent events, BRCA1is
still recruited to DNA lesions, albeit in very slow kinetics (Fig. 4).

Most cancer-associated mutations of BRCA1 occur in the exon 11 of BRCA1 or the Cterminal BRCT domain. These mutations either generate truncated forms of BRCA1
deleting the C-terminal BRCT domain or abolish the tertiary structure of the BRCT
domain129–131. These mutations are likely to be hypomorphic mutations because the mutants
could still be recruited to DNA lesions transiently via the interaction between the BARD1
BRCT domain and PAR, although they could not be stabilized at DNA lesions because of
lacking the BRCA1 BRCT domain. Transient recruitment of these BRCA1 mutants could
only repair some of but not all of DNA lesions. Accumulation of lesions in the genome will
induce genomic instability and tumorigenesis. However, with the PARP inhibitor treatment,
the BRCA1 mutants could not be recruited to the sites of DNA damage since DNA damageinduced PAR synthesis is suppressed. Nor could the mutants slowly accumulate at DNA
lesions because the cancer-associated mutations abolish the BRCA1 BRCT domain. Under
this condition, cells completely lose BRCA1, which eventually induces apoptosis132. This is
likely to be the molecular mechanism by which PARP inhibitors selectively kill tumor cells
with BRCA1 mutations (Fig. 5). In agreement with this model, we found that cells bearing
mutations in the BRCA1 BRCT domain (e.g. P1749R andM1775R) are hypersensitive to
PARP inhibitor treatment33. However, not all the cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations
disrupt the BRCA1 BRCT domain. A set of mutations have been identified in the Ring
domain of BRCA1 as well as in the BARD BRCT domain133–137. In this case, regardless of
the treatment of PARP inhibitors, these BRCA1/BARD1 mutants could not be quickly
recruited to the sites of DNA damage. Thus, tumor cells bearing these mutations may not be
sensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment (Fig. 5). Consistently, we found that cells bearing
mutations in the BRCA1 Ring domain (e.g. C61G) are much less sensitive to PARP
inhibitors than cells with the mutations in the BRCA1 BRCT domain33. Thus, different
cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations have distinct responses to PARP inhibitors, PARP
inhibitors may only be effective to tumors with certain BRCA1 mutations.
Recently, we also demonstrate that the Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold
motif is a novel PAR-binding domain that mediates DNA damage response57. Interestingly,
the OB-fold motif also exists in BRCA2, implying a similar mechanism for PARP inhibitors
selectively suppressing tumors with BRCA2 mutations.

Conclusion and future direction for PARP inhibitors in cancer
chemotherapies

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, during DNA damage response, PAR serves as an initial sensor and mediates
the early recruitment of SSB and DSB repair machineries. Suppression of PAR synthesis by
PARP inhibitors abolishes the early recruitment of DNA damage repair machineries such as
BRCA1, thus sensitizes tumor cells to DNA damaging agents. This could be a novel
molecular mechanism for PARP inhibitors to selectively kill tumor cells, which might be
important for personalized cancer chemotherapies. In addition to BRCA1, PARP inhibitors
suppress the fast recruitment of many other DNA damage repair machineries, which induces
cell lethality or hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Thus, it is possible to target other
types of cancers with PARP inhibitors. For example, Ligase IV is a key enzyme in NHEJ
and is recruited to DNA lesions by PAR32. Mutation of Ligase IV is associated with Ligase
IV syndrome with clinical features such as T-cell lymphoma138–140. These cancerassociated mutations do not exist in the PAR-binding domain and are likely to be
hypomorphic mutations. PARP inhibitor treatment may abolish the fast recruitment of
Ligase IV for NHEJ, thus induces tumor cell lethality or hypersensitive to DNA damaging
agents such as etoposide, mitomycin C and cisplatin. Another example is XRCC1, a scaffold
protein in SSB repair. Mutation of XRCC1 is associated with non-melanoma skin
cancer141, 142. With similar mechanism, it is possible that PARP inhibitor treatment will
selectively kill tumor cells with XRCC1 mutation. Thus, PARP inhibitors may have broader
clinical implications in cancer chemotherapies.

Figure 1. Sketch of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation

Author Manuscript

With NAD+ as the donor, PARPs mediate the genotoxic stress-dependent poly(ADPribosyl)ation. ADP-ribose residues are covalently linked to the side chains of arginine,
lysine, aspartate, or glutamate residues of acceptor proteins. Glycosidic ribose-ribose 1′–2′
bonds between ADP-ribose units generate both linear and branched polymers. The chain
length of PAR is heterogeneous, which can reach up to 200 ADP-ribose units, with 20–50
units in each branch.

Figure 2. Domain architecture of human PARP1

Human PARP1 contains 1014 residues of amino acid with the molecular weight of 116 kDa.
N-terminal three zinc finger motifs (Zn1-3) recognize SSBs and DSBs, which induces the
conformational changes of the Tryptophan-glycine-arginine rich (WGR) and Catalytic
domains and activates the enzymatic activity of PARP1.

Figure 3. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation functions as a sensor for activating DNA damage response

In response to SSBs and DSBs, massive PAR is rapidly generated by PARPs and jumpstarts
DNA damage response. In the NER pathway for SSB repair, PAR mediates the recruitment
of DDB2 and ALC1. In the BER pathway, PAR targets PNKP, APTX, XRCC1 and APLF to
DNA lesions for the subsequent repair. In NHEJ pathway for DSB repair, PAR mediates the
recruitment of the Ligase IV -XRCC4 complex. In HR pathway for DSB repair, PAR is
recognized by several repair machineries, such as the BRCA1-BARD1 complex, the MRN
complex and the hSSB1-INTS complex.

Figure 4. The molecular mechanism of the recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA lesions

BRCA1 and BARD1 form heterodimer via the interaction between the Ring domains. Upon
DNA damage, PAR quickly recruits the BRCA1-BARD1 complex via the interaction with
the BARD1 BRCT. The BRCT of BRCA1 is important for the stable retention of BRCA1/
BARD1 complex at the sites of DNA damage through the interaction with Abraxas/
CCDC98.

Figure 5. A new model of how PARP inhibitors selectively suppress BRCA1-deficient tumors

Author Manuscript

Hypomorphic mutations of BRCA1 abolish the BRCA1 BRCT domain. The mutants can
still be transiently recruited to the sites of DNA damage by PAR. BRCA1 mutants fail to
repair all the lesions, and induce genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Treating these
tumor cells with PARP inhibitors abolishes the transient recruitment of mutant BRCA1.
Without BRCA1, tumor cells undergo apoptosis. However, a set of cancer-associated
mutations exist in the Ring domain of BRCA1 or the BRCT domain of BARD1. In these
cases, PAR does not affect the recruitment of BRCA1. Thus, PARP inhibitors do not
selectively kill tumor cells with these mutations.
