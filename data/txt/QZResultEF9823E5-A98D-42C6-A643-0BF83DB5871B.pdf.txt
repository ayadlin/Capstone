Abstract
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an inherited tumor syndrome that includes susceptibility to
pancreatic islet tumors. This syndrome results from mutations in the MEN1 gene, encoding menin. Although
menin acts as an oncogenic cofactor for mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion protein–mediated histone H3
lysine 4 methylation, the precise basis for how menin suppresses gene expression and proliferation of
pancreatic beta cells remains poorly understood. Here, we show that menin ablation enhances Hedgehog
signaling, a proproliferative and oncogenic pathway, in murine pancreatic islets. Menin directly interacts with
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a negative regulator of gene transcription. Menin recruits
PRMT5 to the promoter of the Gas1 gene, a crucial factor for binding of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand to its
receptor PTCH1 and subsequent activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, increases repressive histone
arginine symmetric dimethylation (H4R3m2s), and suppresses Gas1 expression. Notably, MEN1 diseaserelated menin mutants have reduced binding to PRMT5, and fail to impart the repressive H4R3m2s mark at
the Gas1 promoter, resulting in its elevated expression. Pharmacologic inhibition of Hedgehog signaling
signiﬁcantly reduces proliferation of insulinoma cells, and expression of Hedgehog signaling targets
including Ptch1, in MEN1 tumors of mice. These ﬁndings uncover a novel link between menin and Hedgehog
signaling whereby menin/PRMT5 epigenetically suppresses Hedgehog signaling, revealing it as a target for
treating MEN1 tumors. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2650–8. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an inherited
tumor syndrome, with development of tumors in several
endocrine organs including pancreatic islets (1–4). The gene
mutated in this syndrome, MEN1, encodes a nuclear protein,
menin (5, 6). Menin interacts with diverse proteins to regulate a
variety of cellular functions including control of gene transcription (7, 8). Target-based therapy against MEN1 syndrome
is currently lacking, yet highly desirable.
Epigenetic regulation of gene expression via histone
methylation is crucial for the regulation of onset and
maintenance of various cancers (9). Menin can positively

or negatively affect gene expression. It upregulates expression of antiproliferative genes, such as cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors p18 and p27, partly via upregulating mixed
lineage leukemia (MLL)-mediated histone H3 lysine 4
(H3K4) methylation (10, 11). However, it is not yet well
understood how menin represses gene transcription and
signaling pathways.
The Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates diverse biologic processes ranging from embryonic development to cell
cycle and tumorigenesis (12). With assistance from accessory proteins, such as GPI-anchored cell surface proteins
GAS1, BOC, or CDO (13–15), Hedgehog ligands bind to the
cell surface receptor Patched (PTCH1), resulting in the
release of PTCH1-mediated repression of the cell membrane
protein Smoothened (SMO; ref. 12). Activated SMO enters
the primary cilia and promotes the dissociation of GLI
proteins from SuFu, Fused, and Cos2 complex (16), resulting
in nuclear translocation of transcription factors, GLI1 and
GLI2, and transcription of target genes including proproliferative genes (12). Concomitantly, GLI3 proteolysis to
generate the repressive form, GLI3R, is inhibited (17). Constitutively activated Hedgehog signaling triggers the development of tumors, such as medulloblastomas and basal cell
carcinoma (BCC; refs. 18, 19). It is not yet clear whether
menin inﬂuences Hedgehog signaling during the development of the MEN1 tumor. Here, we show that menin
potently suppresses Hedgehog signaling at least partly via
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)-mediated

Results
Menin represses expression of Gas1, a crucial cofactor
for Hedgehog signaling
Our previous microarray analysis showed that Men1 excision in MEFs upregulated expression of Gas1 (21), and recent
reports show that GAS1 plays a crucial role in enhancing
Hedgehog signaling in cultured cells and during embryonic
development (13–15). We found that ectopic menin expression
in menin-null MEFs reduced the mRNA and protein levels of
GAS1 (Fig. 1A). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed
that complementing the menin-null cells with menin suppressed Sonic Hedgehog ligand (Shh)-induced expression of
Gli1 (Fig. 1B), an effector of Hedgehog signaling (17). Our
results suggest that menin suppresses Hedgehog signaling.
Menin directly interacts with PRMT5, a repressive
histone H4 arginine 3 methyltransferase, and coelutes
with the PRMT5 complex
As menin interacts with proteins like MLL to upregulate
gene expression (11, 25), we sought to identify transcriptional
repressive partner(s) of menin that may downregulate the
expression of Gas1. Ion-exchange chromatography showed
that the majority of menin from nuclear extracts eluted in the
range of 200 to 300 mmol/L NaCl (Fig. 2A). The menin-containing fractions were subjected to afﬁnity puriﬁcation with antiFlag M2-conjugated beads. Menin-interacting proteins were
eluted and separated by gel electrophoresis, followed by silver
staining (Fig. 2B). Mass spectrometry analysis of the puriﬁed
proteins showed that PRMT5 and its associated factor MEP50
were among the major eluted proteins (Fig. 2B). PRMT5
symmetrically dimethylates protein arginine residues, such as
histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3) and histone H3 arginine 8,
resulting in repression of gene expression (26, 27).
Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation using lysates from
HEK293 cells ectopically expressing Flag-tagged menin, followed by Western blotting, conﬁrmed the interaction between

menin and PRMT5 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, MEP50 was also
detected in the anti-menin immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2C).
Importantly, in HEK293 cells expressing only endogenous
menin and PRMT5, immunoprecipitation with 2 independent
menin antibodies effectively pulled down PRMT5 (Fig. 2D).
Similarly, immunoprecipitation with anti-PRMT5 antibody
pulled down menin (Fig. 2E), showing interaction of the
endogenous proteins. Gel ﬁltration chromatography showed
that although menin eluted at several peaks, the fractions
eluting at approximately 500 kDa contained PRMT5 and
MEP50 (Fig. 2F, Lanes 5–6), suggesting that menin/PRMT5/
MEP50 coexist in a complex. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)
pulldown with proteins expressed and puriﬁed from Escherichia coli showed that GST-PRMT5 directly interacted with
His-tagged menin (Fig. 2G). Further analysis of GST-PRMT5
fragments of various lengths (Supplementary Fig. S1A) showed
that amino acid residues 1-210 bound to menin (Supplementary Fig. S1B, lane 3). Deletional analysis of PRMT5 fragment 1210 indicated that amino acid 1-93 was sufﬁcient for binding to
menin (Supplementary Fig. S1C, lane 4). A biotinylated PRMT5
peptide (amino acid 23-51 of PRMT5) conjugated to avidin
beads was sufﬁcient for pulling down menin (Fig. 2H), indicating that menin binds to the N-terminus of PRMT5.
Menin pulls down PRMT5-associated histone H4
methyltransferase activity
To test whether immunoprecipitated menin pulls down
histone methylating activity mediated by PRMT5, 293T cells
were transfected with MEN1 and/or PRMT5 cDNA, followed by
immunoprecipitation with an anti-menin antibody. Histone
methyltransferase (HMT) assay with the immunoprecipitated
complex, 3H-SAM, and recombinant histone H4 showed that
menin pulled down a histone H4 methylating activity, and this
activity was enhanced further when both menin and PRMT5
were ectopically expressed (Fig. 2I, lane 4 vs. 3), thus indicating
that menin-associating PRMT5 is enzymatically functional.
As controls, menin and PRMT5 were expressed as expected
(Fig. 2J).
Microarray analysis reveals common targets of menin
and PRMT5 including Gas1, and shows correlation with
the Hedgehog pathway signature
We conducted cDNA microarray analysis with primary pancreatic islets from control Men1l/l or Men1l/l mice expressing a
TAM-inducible Cre under control of the ubiquitous Ubc9 promoter (Men1l/l;Ubc9CreER) 14 days after Men1 excision (24).
Excision of Men1 in pancreatic islet cells was conﬁrmed by
coimmunostaining for menin and insulin (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 28) of genes
enriched upon Men1 excision in pancreatic islets, in an unbiased
search, matched a group of genes upregulated in the Prmt5knockdown NIH3T3 subset including Gas1 ref. (27; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, the leading-edge subset of the associated signiﬁcant gene sets included Gas1 (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Because GAS1 is actively involved in promoting proproliferative Hedgehog signaling, these ﬁndings suggest that menin
and PRMT5 functionally interact to suppress a common set of
genes including Gas1 to modulate Hedgehog signaling.

Ablation of all 3 Hedgehog coreceptors, GAS1, CDO, and
BOC abrogates Shh-dependant neural progenitors (14), and a
complete loss of Hedgehog-dependant cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP) proliferation (13). Knockdown of Gas1
in MEFs inhibits Shh-induced gene expression (15). From our
microarray analysis of isolated islets from control and Men1D/D
mice, GSEA indicated that there was a modest increase in the
Hedgehog signaling gene set (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These
ﬁndings suggest that menin may effectively dampen, but not
completely block Hedgehog signaling.
PRMT5 is required for suppressing Gas1 expression, and
for optimal histone H4 arginine 3 symmetric
dimethylation at the Gas1 promoter
We knocked down Prmt5 in MEFs using short hairpin
RNAs (shRNA), and qRT-PCR showed that 2 independent
shRNA clones reduced expression of Prmt5 (Fig. 3A), and
moderately increased the mRNA levels of Gas1 (Fig. 3B).
Consistently, reduced PRMT5 expression correlated with

www.aacrjournals.org

increased expression of GAS1 at the protein level, as shown
by Western blotting (Fig. 3C). To determine the impact of
Prmt5 knockdown on histone H4 arginine 3 symmetric
dimethylation (H4R3m2s), catalyzed by PRMT5 (27), at the
Gas1 promoter, we conducted ChIP assay and found that
PRMT5 bound to the Gas1 promoter, and PRMT5 knockdown moderately reduced PRMT5 binding (Fig. 3D). Consistently, PRMT5 knockdown also reduced H4R3m2s levels
at the Gas1 promoter (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S4A).
As a control, no difference in binding was observed at the
actin promoter (Supplementary Fig. S4B). We cultured both
control and PRMT5 knockdown cells in the presence or
absence of Shh ligand and found that PRMT5 knockdown
markedly increased Shh-induced expression of Gli1 and
Ptch1 (Fig. 3E and F), both targets of Hedgehog signaling
(17). Together, these results suggest that PRMT5 plays a
crucial role in suppressing Hedgehog signaling, at least in
part by repressing GAS1 and increasing the repressive
H4R3m2s mark at the promoter.

Menin binds to the promoter of Gas1 and recruits PRMT5
to increase H4R3m2s
To determine whether menin directly regulates expression
of Gas1, we conducted ChIP assay with menin-expressing or
menin-null cells, and showed that menin bound to the Gas1
promoter (Fig. 4A). Consistently, PRMT5 binding and
H4R3m2s at the Gas1 promoter were also markedly reduced
in Men1-null cells (Fig. 4A), indicating that menin recruits
PRMT5 to methylate H4R3 at this target gene.
To determine whether MEN1 disease-related menin point
mutations affect Gas1 expression, we complemented meninnull MEFs with either wild type or mutant forms of menin, and
showed that wild type and mutant menin were expressed at
comparable levels based on Western blotting (Fig. 4B). However, although wild-type menin expression reduced Gas1
mRNA levels, mutant menin lost or partially lost their ability
to repress Gas1 expression (Fig. 4B). ChIP assay showed that
the menin mutants largely retained their ability to bind to the
Gas1 promoter, but failed to impart the H4R3m2s mark at the
promoter (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4C). As a control,
no changes in menin binding or histone H4R3 methylation
were observed at the actin promoter (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
To determine whether the mutations affect the ability of
menin to interact with PRMT5, we ectopically expressed menin
and PRMT5 in 293 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5), and observed
that the interaction between menin and PRMT5 was reduced
considerably in the menin mutants upon comparison with wild
type (Fig. 4D, top). Furthermore, HMT assay with the immunoprecipitated menin complex, 3H-SAM, and recombinant

2654

histone H4 showed that the histone H4 methylating activity
was dramatically reduced in the mutant menin immune complexes compared with wild-type menin (Fig. 4D, third). Collectively, these results suggest that menin-mediated repressive
H4R3m2s at the Gas1 promoter plays a role in suppressing
MEN1 tumorigenesis.
Men1 excision in primary islets results in increased
Hedgehog signaling
To determine whether Men1 is also crucial for regulating
Gas1 expression and Hedgehog signaling, we isolated primary
islets from control Men1l/l and Men1l/l; Rip-cre mice (8-monthsold), and qRT-PCR showed that Men1 excision resulted in
undetectable Men1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5A), but increased mRNA
levels of Gas1 (Fig. 5B), Gli1 (Fig. 5C), and Ptch1 (Fig. 5D),
indicative of enhanced Hedgehog signaling. These results
suggest that menin plays a crucial role in vivo in pancreatic
islets in repressing the expressions of Gas1, Gli1, and Ptch1,
thereby suppressing Hedgehog signaling.
Treatment of Men1-excised mice harboring insulinomas
by a pharmacologic SMO inhibitor reduces proliferation
of insulinoma cells and inhibits Hedgehog signaling
Effective treatment for MEN1 tumors is not yet available.
A Hedgehog signaling inhibitor, GDC-0449, is proven safe
and effective for treating human BCC and medulloblastomas
(29). Because the mouse MEN1 tumor model largely phenocopies the human MEN1 tumor syndrome (30, 31), we
treated 8-month-old Men1l/l; Rip-cre mice, which developed

insulinomas, with either control vehicle or GDC-0449 for
4 weeks (Fig. 6A), and found that GDC-0449 treatment
signiﬁcantly reduced the number of BrdUrd-positive
cells in insulinomas (Fig. 6B and C), by approximately
60% (Fig. 6D). The marked impact of inhibiting Hedgehog
signaling on suppressing neuroendocrine tumors is underscored by the common practice of using the mitotic index
(proliferation) as a common parameter for grading and
prognosis of human neuroendocrine tumors (32). GDC0449 treatment did not affect the area of the insulinoma
(Supplementary Fig. S6A), likely because of the limited
duration of the treatment and/or relative slow growth of
neuroendocrine tumors. However, the treatment reduced
the level of blood insulin, an indicator of secreted insulin
from insulinomas (Supplementary Fig. S6B). This is consistent with the reported observation that mutation of SMO in
adult mice reduces the production of insulin in islets (33).
Moreover, qRT-PCR showed that expression of Ptch1, a

Hedgehog signaling target, was reduced in isolated islets
from Men1l/l; pdxCreER mice treated with GDC-0449 (Fig. 6E)
compared with vehicle-treated mice, indicating that GDC0449 was effective in suppressing Hedgehog signaling. We
cannot rule out that the SMO inhibitor also, at least, partially
inhibits Hedgehog signaling from stromal cells surrounding
the Men1-deleted tumor cells that act in a paracrine fashion.
Nevertheless, our ﬁndings clearly indicate that GDC-0449
effectively suppresses proliferation of MEN1 tumor cells in
vivo, link menin to suppression of Hedgehog, and uncovers
the Hedgehog signaling pathway as a promising target for
improving therapy against neuroendocrine tumors.

Discussion
Although menin regulates cell-cycle genes and represses cell
proliferation (34), it has been underexplored as to what signaling pathways are dysregulated by menin mutations. Our
ﬁndings suggest that normally menin "gates" the Hedgehog

signaling threshold, at least partly, by repressing Gas1 to
prevent overt activation of Hedgehog signaling in islet cells.
Men1 mutations in some islet cells may stochastically trigger
overt Hedgehog signaling, which can induce expression of
proproliferative genes such as cyclin D1 (35), thereby increasing cell proliferation. Consistently, expression of Gli1 and
Ptch1, an indicator of activated Hedgehog signaling, was
increased in primary islets from Men1-excised mice. The link

between menin and Hedgehog signaling represents a new
mechanism for menin-mediated tumor suppression (Fig. 6F).
We found that menin directly interacts with PRMT5, which
catalyzes repressive H4R3m2s (27). Both menin and PRMT5
directly bound to the promoter of Gas1, a component of the
Hedgehog signaling pathway. Menin is crucial for recruitment
of PRMT5 to and for effective methylation of H4R3 at the Gas1
promoter (Fig. 4A), a novel means for menin-mediated repression of gene expression. However, it must be noted that it
remains unclear how menin is recruited to the Gas1 promoter,
and whether menin directly binds the Gas1 promoter DNA to
repress Gas1 expression. In addition to PRMT5, the repressive
histone H4R3m2s mark is catalyzed by another type II PRMT
enzyme, PRMT7 (36, 37). However, we found that only PRMT5
was detected in the menin immunoprecipitates, whereas
PRMT7 did not coimmunoprecipitate with menin (Supplementary Fig. S7). This clearly indicates that the menin-dependant histone H4R3m2s mark at the Gas1 promoter can be
attributed to PRMT5, and not PRMT7.
Our data show that menin immunoprecipitates possess
HMT activity toward recombinant histone H4, and that this
activity is lost in certain disease-related Men1 mutations
resulting from compromised interaction with PRMT5 (Fig.
4D). It has previously been reported that menin immunoprecipitates have HMT activity toward histone H3 but not histone
H4 (25), whereas HMT activity toward recombinant histone H4
was clearly observed in our studies. It is possible that the
immunoprecipitate conditions used by Hughes and colleagues
preferentially retain MLL activity that methylates H3K4. Alternatively, the MLL enzymatic activity toward histone H3 might
be more robust than the PRMT5 activity toward histone H4 in
the menin immunoprecipitates. This would result in preferential methylation of histone H3 when a mixture of core
histones is used. In contrast, puriﬁed recombinant histone
H4 alone was used in our study, thus favoring observation of
histone H4 methylation. Nevertheless, our data clearly show

Epigenetic Repression of Hedgehog Signaling by Menin

that menin interacts with PRMT5, and the associated histone
arginine methylation activity is necessary for repressing Gas1
and the canonical Hedgehog signaling pathway.
Although multiple factors have been previously reported to
affect Hedgehog signaling, such as PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GLI proteins and proteolysis of GLI proteins (16), it
has been poorly understood as to whether and how epigenetic
factors affect Hedgehog signaling. We found that both menin
and PRMT5 are crucial for PRMT5-mediated H4R3m2s at the
Gas1 promoter. PRMT5-mediated H4R3m2s suppresses gene
expression of b-globin genes in hematopoietic cells partly
through recruiting DNMT3A via increasing repressive mark
H4R3m2s at the promoter to silence the gene by promoter DNA
methylation (38). Our results reveal the PRMT5-mediated
epigenetic mechanism in repressing Hedgehog signaling and
suppression of tumorigenesis.
Our studies involving MEN1 disease-related menin mutants
showed that certain point mutants failed to suppress the
expression of Gas1 (Figs. 4B and 4C), suggesting that meninmediated suppression of Gas1 and canonical Hedgehog signaling may be relevant to its function in suppressing MEN1 tumor
syndrome. Furthermore, inhibition of Hedgehog signaling with
the SMO inhibitor GDC-0449 markedly reduces tumor cell
proliferation in a MEN1 mouse model (Fig. 6D), indicating that
canonical Hedgehog signaling plays a signiﬁcant role in proliferation of Men1-excised islet cells. It is noteworthy that GDC0449 inhibition of SMO may have additional effects besides
restoring the role of menin in repressing Gas1, as inhibition of
Hedgehog signaling in a transgenic mouse model in which the
artiﬁcial Rip-driven SV40 T antigen promotes development of
insulinoma, represses growth of the transgene-induced islet
tumors (39). However, we found, for the ﬁrst time, that Men1
mutation in b cells in vivo leads to enhanced Hedgehog signaling,
which may contribute to increasing b-cell proliferation.
The normal role of Hedgehog signaling in regulating pancreatic islets and b cells is complex, inﬂuenced by temporal and
spatial factors (33). Hedgehog ligand stimulates production of
insulin in cultured b cells (40), whereas knockout of SMO in
pancreatic epithelial cells initially reduces the size of islets
during embryonic development and decreases total insulin
production in adult mice (33). Hedgehog ligand expression or
Hedgehog signaling is also increased in human gastrointestinal
neuroendocrine tumors or in mouse small cell lung cancer (41,
42). Our results show that Men1 ablation leads to increase in
expression of Hedgehog target genes in pancreatic islets, and
the SMO inhibitor suppresses proliferation of MEN1 tumors.
However, MEN1 deletion in mice does not result in the typical
Hedgehog pathway-related tumors such as medulloblastoma.

These ﬁndings are consistent with the notion that menin/
PRMT5 modulates (but does not completely block) Hedgehog
signaling partly through reducing Gas1 expression. It is likely
that menin does so in endocrine cells like b cells because menin
is more abundantly expressed in b cells (24). Similarly, it has
been shown that Men1 excision in the liver has no affect on
proliferation (43), thus highlighting the tissue-speciﬁc effect of
Men1 ablation. Although PRMT5 can promote tumorigenesis
in multiple tissues via regulating various partners such as p53
(44), cyclin D1 (45), and Janus-activated kinase-2 (46), it may
partner with menin to dampen Hedgehog signaling in certain
endocrine cells. In aggregate, our ﬁndings, for the ﬁrst time,
reveal that MEN1 mutation leads to enhanced Hedgehog
signaling via a previously unknown epigenetic mechanism,
and pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway signiﬁcantly
reduces proliferation of Men1-mutated pancreatic tumors in
mice. As more than 40% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
harbor somatic mutations in the MEN1 gene (47), Hedgehog
antagonists may be valuable to improve therapy for neuroendocrine tumors with MEN1 mutation.
