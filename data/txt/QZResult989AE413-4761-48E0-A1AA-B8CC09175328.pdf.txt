Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles are manufactured
worldwide in large quantities for use in a wide range of applications including pigment and cosmetic manufacturing. Although TiO 2 is chemically inert, TiO 2 nanoparticles can
cause negative health effects, such as respiratory tract cancer
in rats. However, the mechanisms involved in TiO2-induced
genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have not been clearly defined
and are poorly studied in vivo. The present study investigates
TiO2 nanoparticles–induced genotoxicity, oxidative DNA damage, and inflammation in a mice model. We treated wild-type
mice with TiO2 nanoparticles in drinking water and determined the extent of DNA damage using the comet assay, the
micronuclei assay, and the γ-H2AX immunostaining assay and
by measuring 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine levels and, as a
genetic instability endpoint, DNA deletions. We also determined mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood. Our results show that TiO2 nanoparticles induced
8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, γ-H2AX foci, micronuclei, and
DNA deletions. The formation of γ-H2AX foci, indicative of
DNA double-strand breaks, was the most sensitive parameter.
Inflammation was also present as characterized by a moderate inflammatory response. Together, these results describe
the first comprehensive study of TiO2 nanoparticles–induced
genotoxicity in vivo in mice possibly caused by a secondary
genotoxic mechanism associated with inflammation and/or
oxidative stress. Given the growing use of TiO2 nanoparticles,
these findings raise concern about potential health hazards
associated with TiO2 nanoparticles exposure. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) accounts for 70% of the total production volume of pigments worldwide (1). It is widely used to provide
whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, plastics, papers,
inks, food colorants, and toothpastes. TiO2 is also used in cosmetic
and skin care products, particularly in sunblocks, where it helps to
protect the skin from UV light, especially in the case of nanosized
particles (<100 nm). Nevertheless, TiO2 has recently been reclassified by the IARC as group 2B carcinogen: “possibly carcinogenic to

humans”.6 The reason for this new classification stems from the
fact that high concentrations of pigment-grade (<2.5 μm) and ultrafine (<100 nm) TiO2 dust can cause respiratory tract cancer in
exposed rats (2, 3). However, it should be noted that epidemiologic
studies of workers exposed to pigment-grade TiO2 conducted thus
far have not been able to detect an association between occupational exposure to TiO2 and an increased risk for lung cancer
(4, 5). Genotoxicity studies that measure different types of DNA
damage (e.g., gene mutations, chromosomal damage, and DNA
strand break formation) are an important part of cancer research
and risk assessment of potential carcinogens. These studies help to
understand possible mechanisms causing tumor induction. As
such, in vivo mechanisms underlying TiO2 nanoparticles tumor
induction are still unclear.
Because nanoparticle diameter does not exceed a hundred nanometers at maximum, they are able to penetrate cells (6) and interfere with several subcellular mechanisms. Indeed, some studies
show that some nanoparticles can penetrate into cell nuclei and
hence may directly interfere with the structure and function of genomic DNA (7). Additionally, after oral administration in mice,
TiO2 particles were shown to translocate to systemic organs such
as liver and spleen as well as lung and peritoneal tissues (8). Genotoxicity studies have been done to understand the carcinogenic
potential of TiO2 nanoparticles using assays that measure mutations in genes (e.g., Ames/Salmonella and hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt) assays; refs. 9–11), chromosomal
damage representing possible clastogenic activity of the particles
(e.g., micronuclei; refs. 10, 12–15), and DNA strand breakage
(e.g., alkaline comet assay; refs. 10, 13). Except for one, these studies were conducted in vitro in cultured cells but conflict in their
results. Half of the studies show that TiO2 nanoparticles are genotoxic in cell lines (10, 12, 13, 15), whereas the other half show that
TiO 2 nanoparticles are not (9, 11, 14). The rationale for these
conflicting results is not clear because different cell types, doses,
and nanoparticle sizes have been used. Some studies suggest
possible mechanisms for TiO 2 nanoparticles genotoxicity. TiO 2
nanoparticles might damage DNA directly or indirectly via oxidative stress and/or inflammatory responses. Two recent studies
show a direct chemical interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles
and DNA, through the DNA phosphate group, but a link to mutagenesis has not been proven (16, 17). On the other hand, other
studies show that TiO 2 nanoparticles can cause DNA damage
indirectly through inflammation (18–21) and generation of reactive oxygen species (12, 13, 22, 23).

TiO2 Nanoparticles Induce DNA Damage In vivo

nanoparticles–treated mice. *, P < 0.05.

Thus far, most nanoparticle genotoxicity studies have focused
on cell culture systems, but confirmation from animal experiments, more relevant to human exposure, is required. To further
understand TiO2 nanoparticles toxicity in vivo, we studied the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles exposure on genotoxicity, DNA damage,
and inflammation in mice. To evaluate inflammation in mice, we
determined mRNA expression of both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. To assess DNA damage, we used the
γ-H2AX and the comet assays to evaluate DNA strand breaks,
the micronuclei assay to estimate chromosomal damage, and the
measure of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels using
high-performance liquid chromatography to determine oxidative
DNA damage. We also used an in vivo DNA deletion assay, which
allows visual detection of DNA deletion events within the pink-eyed
unstable (pun) locus in developing mouse embryos (24), which can
detect environmental as well as genetic cancer predisposing factors (24). Our results show that TiO2 P25 nanoparticles can induce
8-OHdG, γ-H2AX foci, micronuclei, DNA deletions, and inflammation markers in a mice model. Therefore, this study suggests that
TiO2 nanoparticles are genotoxic in vivo.

160 ± 5 nm. About 70% of particles have a size of 160 nm. Solutions of
dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by ultrasonication (Solid
State/Ultrasonic FS-14; Fisher Scientific) for 15 min in drinking water at
60, 120, 300, and 600 μg/mL concentrations just before use. We measured
TiO2 nanoparticles–supplemented water intake at the end of experiments
in each cage, which housed 2 to 3 mice, and calculated an average daily
water intake per mouse. Daily TiO2 nanoparticles–supplemented water
intake ranged from 3 to 7 mL/mouse, consistent with normal daily water
intake. Doses were calculated using a 30 g average weight per mouse, and
an average of 5 mL water intake per day. The exposure was 5 days in adult
males. For in utero exposure, pregnant dams were given nanoparticlessupplemented drinking water for 10 days from 8.5 to 18.5 days post-coitum
at a concentration of 300 μg/mL. Water was used as negative control.
In vivo DNA deletion assay. To evaluate genotoxicity of TiO2 nanoparticles, we employed an intrachromosomal duplication of 70-kb fragment
spanning exons 6 to 18 of the p gene in mice (termed pun mutation). When
a DNA deletion event occurs between these duplications, the pun allele reverts to the wild-type p gene. Reconstitution of the wild-type p gene can be
seen as a single pigmented cell or a clone of pigmented cells on the unpigmented retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the transgenic mice and represents a DNA deletion as a permanent genotoxic event (29). Pregnant mice
were treated with TiO2 nanoparticles, and offspring were sacrificed at age
20 days. Their eyes were extracted and dissected to display the RPE for the
deletion/eyespot assay as described previously (24). One RPE corresponds
to one eye.
Alkaline comet assay. Peripheral blood was collected by submandibular vein puncture (before treatment and after treatment) in an EDTAcoated tube. The comet assay was done as described previously (30). On
average, from three slides, 150 to 200 randomly captured comets per sample were analyzed. Results were expressed as average ± SE tail moment.
Micronuclei assay. The micronuclei assay was done as described elsewhere (31). Three microliter aliquots of the peripheral blood were collected
as described above and smeared on slides and stained into Giemsa stain for
1.5 min. Approximately 2,000 erythrocytes were scored per animal to estimate the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes.
Bone marrow preparation. Animals were sacrificed with an overdose
of isoflurane after 5 days of treatment with TiO2 nanoparticles in drinking
water. Both femora were dissected, and marrow cells were flushed out with
1 mL PBS and pipetted several times. The cell suspension was centrifuged
at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was withdrawn, and the cell pellet
was resuspended and placed on a clean glass slide.

Materials and Methods
Mouse care and breeding. C57Bl/6Jpun/pun mice were obtained from
The Jackson Laboratory. The C57Bl/6Jpun/pun background is essentially
identical to C57Bl/6J, with the exception of a naturally occurring 70-kb internal duplication in the pink-eyed dilution (p) gene, termed the pun allele.
Mice were housed and cared for under standard specific pathogen-free
conditions and according to the Animal Rescue Coalition and Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee regulations. Mice were given a standard,
autoclaved diet from Harlan Teklad (Harlan Teklad No. 8656) and sterilized
water ad libitum. Mice were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Pregnancy
was timed by checking for vaginal plugs, with noon of the day of discovery
counted as 0.5 days post-coitum. Four- to 5-month-old mice were used for
all experiments.
TiO2 nanoparticles preparation and exposure. “Aeroxide” P25 TiO2
(Degussa, now Evonik) nanoparticles were chosen for this study. The crystal structure is a mixture of 75% anatase and 25% rutile TiO2, purity was
at least 99.5% TiO2, and primary particle size was 21 nm with a specific
surface area of 50 ± 15 m2/g. These nanoparticles have been used in many
of the previous mammalian studies (13, 14, 22, 25–28). Using dynamic
light scattering in water revealed that the size of TiO2 nanoparticles
agglomerates ranged from 21 to 1,446 nm and the mean size was

Results

These data provided evidence that, after oral administration, TiO2
nanoparticles induce DSBs in bone marrow cells.
TiO2 nanoparticles increased DNA strand breaks. DNA stand
breaks (DSBs, single-strand breaks, and/or strand breaks induced
by alkali-labile sites) were measured by the alkaline comet assay in
mice peripheral blood before and after treatment. Tail moment significantly increased after TiO2 nanoparticles treatment (Fig. 3). The
average tail moment was 0.0102 ± 0.001 before treatment and
0.0137 ± 0.0011 after TiO2 nanoparticles treatment. TiO2 nanoparticles increased DNA strand breaks in WBCs from peripheral blood
by 34% (P = 0.001, t test, and P = 0.04, Wilcoxon test).
TiO2 nanoparticles induced micronuclei. The micronuclei assay was used to detect chromosomal damage in erythrocytes from
peripheral blood. The incidence of micronuclei serves as an index
of clastogenicity. Micronuclei frequency increased significantly
only at the highest (500 mg/kg) dose of TiO2 nanoparticles used
(P = 0.009; Fig. 4). At this dose, the average micronuclei frequencies
for untreated mice were 4.3 ± 0.93 versus 9.2 ± 1.07 per 2,000 RBC
for TiO2 nanoparticles–treated mice, which resulted in a 2.1-fold
increase in micronuclei formation. This result showed that, at high
dose, TiO2 nanoparticles induced detectable clastogenicity in mice
peripheral blood.
TiO2 nanoparticles induced oxidative DNA damage. We examined the degree of oxidative DNA damage by measuring the
level of 8-OHdG in DNA isolated from TiO2 nanoparticles–treated
and untreated mouse livers. The level of 8-OHdG was significantly
higher in TiO 2 nanoparticles–treated than untreated mice
(P = 0.04; Fig. 5). The average number of 8-OHdG per 106 dG
was 4.25 ± 0.66 for untreated mice and 6.43 ± 0.58 for TiO2
nanoparticles–treated mice resulting in a 1.5-fold increase at
500 mg/kg TiO2 nanoparticles. This suggested that TiO2 nanoparticles induced oxidative DNA damage in liver.
TiO2 nanoparticles induced a proinflammatory response.
We quantified mRNA transcripts of three Th1/proinflammatory
cytokines (T-helper cell type 1) and three Th2/anti-inflammatory
cytokines (T-helper cell type 2) in the peripheral blood. After treatment, the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α,
IFN-γ, and the mouse orthologue of interleukin-8 (KC) were significantly upregulated (P = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively; Fig. 6A).

TiO2 nanoparticles increased the frequency of DNA deletions. We used the DNA deletion assay to evaluate in vivo genotoxicity of TiO 2 nanoparticles. We quantified the number of
eyespots per RPE as a measure of DNA deletions in in utero
exposed mice. TiO2 nanoparticles–treated mice had an average
of 8.13 ± 1.70 eyespots per RPE versus 6.42 ± 1.47 eyespots per
RPE in nontreated mice (Fig. 1). TiO2 nanoparticles–exposed mice
displayed a significant increase in eyespots (27%) compared with
unexposed mice (P = 0.019), suggesting that, after maternal oral
exposure, TiO2 nanoparticles increased DNA deletion frequency
in fetuses.
TiO2 nanoparticles induced γ-H2AX foci. Phosphorylation of
histone H2AX on serine 139 occurs at sites flanking DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB), providing a measure of the number of DSBs
within a cell (33). We used this assay to compare DSB formation
in bone marrow of mice with and without TiO2 nanoparticles
treatment.
The γ-H2AX foci formation increased by ∼10%, 20%, 25%, and
30% following treatment with 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively, compared with untreated mice (Fig. 2).
Percentage of γ-H2AX–positive cells increased with TiO2 nanoparticles concentration in a clear dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001).

γ-H2AX assay, RNA isolation, and quantitative real-time PCR. The
γ-H2AX assay was done with bone marrow cells, and the RNA isolation for
quantitative real-time PCR was carried out on peripheral blood. These assays were done as described elsewhere (31).
Determination of oxidative DNA damage by measuring 8-OHdG.
Mouse livers were isolated just after 5 days of treatment with nanoparticles and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized under
liquid nitrogen. 8-OHdG level was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with electron capture detection system as described
previously (32).
Statistical analysis. For the deletion assay, the comet assay, the micronuclei assay, and 8-OHdG and mRNA levels of cytokines, we used the Student's t test to compare untreated mice with treated mice. For the γ-H2AX
experiment, the percentage of positive cells for control groups versus treated groups was compared via χ2 test. In addition to the t test, for comet
assay data, the Wilcoxon test for matched paired data was also used to
compare the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the tail moment before and
after nanoparticle treatment. The difference was considered significant at
the 95% confidence level (P < 0.05) and highly significant at the 99% confidence level (P ≤ 0.01).

TiO2 Nanoparticles Induce DNA Damage In vivo

nanoparticles–treated mouse livers. Mean ± SE (n = 5 mice/group). *, P < 0.05,
compared with untreated mice.

A general upregulation of these cytokines may be due to the effects
of circulating TiO2 nanoparticles directly in the peripheral blood,
suggesting systemic distribution, and direct activation of a proinflammatory response. In the contrary, anti-inflammatory cytokines
with generally opposing function were not upregulated, including
transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-10, and interleukin-4
(Fig. 6B). TiO2 nanoparticles did not induce an anti-inflammatory
response, which mean they did not inhibit the production and
release of proinflammatory mediators.

Discussion
Here, we report for the first time that TiO2 nanoparticles are
genotoxic and clastogenic in vivo in mice. We showed that TiO2
nanoparticles (500 mg/kg) induce not only DNA single-strand
breaks and DSBs but also chromosomal damage. The formation
of γ-H2AX foci, which show DSB formation, was the most sensitive
parameter and showed a consistent dose-dependent response.
Concerning health relevance, DSBs are much more damaging in
terms of genetic instability than single-strand breaks and oxidative
DNA damage, which are transient. Our results extend previous
in vitro findings with the micronuclei and comet assays in several
human cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells (10, 12, 13, 15),

although they have not been detected in some studies (11, 14).
Differences in response between studies may be due to how TiO2
nanoparticles differ in terms of TiO2 production, particle size, degree of aggregation, preparation method (sonication), incubation
conditions, dose, and susceptibility between cell types (34, 35),
implying that more studies are needed to determine the conditions
in which TiO2 nanoparticles genotoxicity occurs.
To date, very few in vivo genotoxicity studies have been carried
out with nanoparticles. A chronic exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles
at concentrations that produce chronic pulmonary inflammation
was associated with an increased incidence of tumors in rat lungs
(3). Thus far, only two in vivo genotoxicity studies have been reported, which showed that in vivo TiO2 nanoparticles increased
Hprt mutation frequency in alveolar epithelial cells (9) but did
not induce DNA adduct formation in rat lungs (26). Our study
showed for the first time that, in vivo after oral exposure, TiO2
nanoparticles induce DNA strand breaks and chromosomal damage
in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood, which may help to further
understand potential mechanisms of TiO2 nanoparticles carcinogenicity. We also found that maternal exposure to 500 mg/kg TiO2
nanoparticles during gestation results in significantly elevated frequencies of DNA deletions in offspring. This result is a major finding because it shows for the first time that in utero exposure of
fetuses via the mother causes an increase in large deletions in offspring. Taken together, our findings show that TiO2 nanoparticles,
orally administrated, induce genotoxicity systemically in organs,
such as blood, bone marrow, and even the embryo.
Surprisingly, human studies have not been able to detect any
relation between TiO2 occupational exposure and cancer risk (4,
5, 36), but these studies have methodologic and epidemiologic limitations as reviewed by the National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health (37). In addition, these studies were not designed
to investigate the relationship between TiO2 particle size and lung
cancer risk, an important question for assessing the potential occupational carcinogenicity of TiO2. Indeed, Dankovic and colleagues, comparing several tumor studies, pointed out that TiO2
nanoparticles produced lung tumors in rats at a much lower dose
than fine particles (<250 nm; 10 and 250 mg/m3 for nanoparticles
and fine particles, respectively; ref. 3). Although TiO2 nanoparticles
are prone to forming agglomerates of >100 nm in solution, these
agglomerates are apparently not stable and appear to dissociate in

bodily fluids and tissues, which could be an explanation for TiO2
nanoparticles higher toxicity. It has also been reported that TiO2
nanoparticles surface interactions are weak (20). In addition, an inhalation study showed that TiO2 nanoparticles agglomerates of
∼700 nm dissociate into smaller units after deposition in the lung
(21). Even if nanoparticles aggregate into larger-sized agglomerates,
their primary particle sizes remain a significant trait that affects
their toxicity. Further human studies would be necessary to understand nanoparticle health effects. For instance, one could use
blood-based assays similar to those done in this study in a future
molecular epidemiology study in occupational settings. Furthermore, TiO2 is also used in food colorants and toothpaste. This supports the notion that nanoparticle ingestion constitutes a relevant
route of exposure in humans and underscores the significance of
the findings of our study. In addition, given the capability of nanoparticles to enter the systemic blood circulation, nanoparticles may
pose hazard to a variety of other organs as we have shown here.
As suggested previously, a possible mechanism for nanoparticlescaused genotoxicity might be via oxidative stress (38). Indeed, previous studies showed that TiO2 nanoparticles have hydroxyl radical
activity (39–41) and can also trigger reactive oxygen species production in different cell lines (13, 42) on interaction with the cell membrane or even in cell-free environment (23, 43). We confirmed these
results in our in vivo experiment by showing oxidative DNA damage
(8-OHdG) increase in mouse livers after TiO2 nanoparticles treatment. Also, TiO2 nanoparticles–increased DNA deletions during
fetal development might be a result of oxidative genome damage.
As discussed previously (44), oxidative stress is particularly hazardous in replicating cells. For instance, oxidative DNA lesions (e.g.,
8-OHdG, single-strand breaks, or stalled replication forks) can lead
to DSBs after replication, which can result in recombination, thus
producing permanent genome rearrangements. As shown in yeast,
oxidative mutagens might be powerful inducers of DNA deletions
(45). Because embryonic cells are generally characterized by a high
replication index, they might be particularly susceptible to oxidative
genome damage.
We have also observed an inflammatory reaction as shown by
changes in cytokine expression in peripheral blood, in which
TiO2 nanoparticles could be exerting direct inflammatory effects
on circulating innate cells and Th1 effector cells. The inflammatory
response involving recruitment and activation of phagocytes is

capable of causing oxidative bursts that may serve as a possible
explanation for the observed genotoxicity to peripheral leukocytes,
micronuclei formation, oxidative DNA damage in liver cells, and
DNA deletion induction in fetal RPE. Because we showed that in
mice TiO2 nanoparticles induce an inflammatory reaction and oxidative DNA damage, it is tempting to speculate that the mechanism underlying TiO 2 nanoparticles genotoxicity might be a
secondary (indirect) genotoxicity pathway as suggested by Dankovic
and colleagues (3). Secondary genotoxicity is considered to be the
key aspect of some particle toxicity (e.g., quartz and silica) because
of their ability to elicit persistent inflammation in vivo (9, 46).
This implies that particles have prooxidant and proinflammatory
activity, leading to genotoxicity.
In summary, our study showed for the first time that TiO2 nanoparticles induce clastogenicity, genotoxicity, oxidative DNA
damage, and inflammation in vivo in mice. These results have been
observed after only 5 days of treatment via drinking water and in
multiple organs suggesting a systemic effect. We also showed that
in utero exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increased frequency in DNA deletions in the fetus. These results represent the
first comprehensive in vivo genotoxicity study of TiO2 nanoparticles. These data suggest that we should be concerned about a potential risk of cancer or genetic disorders especially for people
occupationally exposed to high concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles and that it might be prudent to limit ingestion of TiO2 nanoparticles through nonessential drug additives, food colors, etc.
