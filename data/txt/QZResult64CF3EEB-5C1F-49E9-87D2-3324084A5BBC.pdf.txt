ABSTRACT
Increasing evidence support the critical roles of active stromal fibroblasts in
breast cancer development and spread. However, the mediators and the mechanisms
of regulation are still not well defined. We have shown here that the tumor suppressor
p16INK4A protein inhibits the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts
through repressing the expression/secretion of IL-6. Indeed, p16INK4A suppresses
IL-6 at the mRNA and protein levels. This effect is mediated trough miR-146b-5p,
which inhibits IL-6 expression through a specific sequence at the IL-6 3′UTR. In
addition, we present clear evidence that miR-146b-5p inhibition is sufficient to
transactivate breast stromal fibroblasts, which promote epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition in breast cancer cells in a paracrine manner. By contrast, ectopic expression
of miR-146b-5p in active fibroblasts abrogated their pro-carcinogenic effects. The
physiological importance of miR-146b-5p inhibition was revealed by showing that
the levels of pre-miR-146b-5p as well as its mature form are reduced in cancerassociated fibroblasts as compared with their normal adjacent counterparts from
cancer-free tissues isolated from the same patients. Interestingly, treatment of
active breast stromal fibroblasts with curcumin increased the level of the p16INK4A
coding CDKN2A mRNA and miR-146b-5p and suppressed IL-6, which confirms the
repressive effect of these two tumor suppressor molecules on IL-6, and shows the
possible “normalization” of cancer-related active fibroblasts. These results show that
miR-146b-5p has non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function through inhibition
of IL-6, suggesting that targeting this microRNA in breast stromal fibroblasts could
be of great therapeutic value.

inhibitor p16INK4A (p16) [3, 4]. Indeed, we have recently
shown the role of p16 downregulation in the activation of
breast stromal fibroblasts [3, 5]. This effect is mediated
through the up-regulation and increase in the secretion of
SDF1 [3]. These findings unraveled non-cell-autonomous
tumor suppressor functions of p16 through repressing
the paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal
fibroblasts.
In addition to SDF1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is also
an important secreted soluble factor that plays crucial
role in the crosstalk between cancer cells and their
microenvironment. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine
implicated in both innate and acquired immune responses,

INTRODUCTION
In a tumor, cancer cells are surrounded by
various types of cells, which compose the tumor
microenvironment. Stromal fibroblasts, which include
normal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, are considered
sustaining players in the tumor microenvironment.
In fact, active cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
support the growth and dissemination of cancer cells
in a non-cell-autonomous manner through secretion of
various chemokines, cytokines and growth factors [1, 2].
These secretions are under the control of several tumor
suppressor genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase

in vitro [17–19], as well as breast cancer metastasis [20].
Furthermore, miR-146b-5p inhibits NF-kB activity and the
inflammatory pathway in breast cancer cells [17, 21].
In the present study, we have shown that the tumor
suppressor p16 protein suppresses the expression of IL-6
in a miR-146b-5p-dependent manner. We present also
clear evidence that miR-146b-5p has non-cell-autonomous
tumor suppressive functions.

hematopoiesis, inflammation as well as in the regulation
of growth and differentiation of cancer cells [6]. Breast
cancer tissues express high levels of IL-6 as compared
with matched normal tissues and these levels increase
with tumor grade [7]. We have recently shown that IL-6
is involved in breast cancer cells –dependent activation
of breast stromal fibroblasts [5]. Moreover, it has been
recently shown that CAFs from human breast and
ovarian tumors express high levels of IL-6 [8, 9]. The
IL-6 gene is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional
and post-transcriptional levels [10, 11]. Recently, several
microRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to be involved in this
regulation [12].
miRNAs are defined as single stranded short
(19–25 nucleotides in length), noncoding endogenous
RNAs,  which negatively regulate plethora of genes
implicated in various biochemical pathways. Therefore,
alteration of their expression is related to various
diseases including cancer [13, 14]. miRNAs act as
tumour suppressors or oncogenes, and are involved in
various steps of the carcinogenesis process, including
metastasis [15]. miR-146b-5p is an important tumour
suppressor miRNA [16]. Indeed, miR-146b-5p was
shown to suppress EGFR expression and reduces the
migration and invasion of glioma and breast cancer cells

RESULTS
p16 represses IL-6 expression
We have recently shown that p16 suppresses the
pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts [3].
Since these cells secrete IL-6, which is a major player
in breast carcinogenesis, especially the carcinomastroma reciprocal interplay, we sought to investigate
the possible role of p16 in repressing the expression of
IL-6. Therefore, we first assessed the levels of p16 and
IL-6 in CAF-64 cells and their counterparts isolated
from histologically normal part of the same breast
(TCF-64) by immunoblotting using specific antibodies,
and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. Figure 1A
shows an inverse correlation between the expression of

p16 and IL-6. Indeed, while p16 was undetectable in
CAF-64 cells, IL-6 was highly expressed in these cells as
compared to their control TCF-64 cells (Figure 1A). To
confirm this link between p16 and IL-6, we knocked-down
p16 in TCF-64 cells using specific shRNA (T64sh), while
a scrambled sequence was used as control (T64C) [3], and
then we assessed the levels of both proteins. Figure 1A
shows that p16 down-regulation led to strong increase
in the IL-6 level, which mirrors their expression in the
CAF/TCF-64 pair. To rule out the possible implication
of the cell cycle in this p16-related effect, we studied the
cell cycle distribution of T64sh and T64C exponentially
growing cells by flow cytometry. Figure 1B shows similar
number of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle in
both cell cultures, indicating that p16 down-regulation
did not affect the cell cycle distribution, which excludes
the possible implication of cell cycle in p16-dependent
repression of IL-6 expression.
Next, we investigated the effect of p16 on the IL-6
mRNA. Therefore, total RNA was extracted from T64C
and T64sh cells, and quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using specific
primers was performed. Figure 1C shows that the mRNA
level of IL-6 doubled in T64sh cells as compared to the
control T64C cells, indicating that the IL-6 mRNA level
is regulated in a p16-dependent manner. To further verify
this, we ectopically expressed the p16 coding CDKN2A
gene in the p16-deficient CAF-64 cells (C64O), while
an empty vector was used as control (C64C) [3]. Total
RNA was purified and amplified by qRT-PCR. Figure 1D
shows 2.4 fold decrease in the level of the IL-6 mRNA in
C64O cells as compared to C64C cells. This shows that
p16 represses the IL-6 mRNA expression in breast stromal
fibroblasts.
Additionally, we studied the effect of p16 on the
secretion of the IL-6 protein. To this end, T64C and
T64sh cells were cultured in serum-free media (SFM)
for 24 h, and the resulting serum-free conditioned media
(SFCM) were collected and the level of secreted IL-6 was
assessed by ELISA. Figure 1E shows that p16 knockdown
increased the secretion of the IL-6 protein (4.5 fold) as
compared to the control cells. On the other hand, ectopic
expression of the CDKN2A gene significantly reduced the
secreted level of the IL-6 protein (3 fold) as compared
to the control cells (Figure 1F). This indicates that p16
suppresses the secretion of the IL-6 protein from breast
stromal fibroblasts.

are IL-6-related,  we  first inhibited IL-6 in SFCM from
T64sh  cells  (T64sh-SFCM) using 2 concentrations of
specific inhibitory antibody (30 and 300 ng/ml) for 24 h.
SFCM from control cells (T64C-SFCM) and IgG antibody
added to T64sh-SFCM were utilized as controls. These
media were used to study the effect on the invasion/
migration abilities of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells using Boyden chambers, either matrigel coated
(invasion) or non-coated (migration). Figure 2 shows
that the inhibition of IL-6 in T64sh-SFCM significantly
reduced the migration/invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231
cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This shows
that IL-6 inhibition inhibits the paracrine pro-invasive/
migratory effects of p16 down-regulation in breast
stromal fibroblasts. To confirm this effect, pure IL-6
protein (2.5 and 5 μg/ml) was added to SFM, and then
was used to assess the effect on the migration/invasion
abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells as described above. Figure
2 shows an IL-6-dependent increase in the migration/
invasion capacities of breast cancer cells as compared
to the negative control. These results indicate that IL-6
is a potent mediator of the paracrine pro-migratory/
invasiveness capacities of p16 deficient breast stromal
fibroblasts.

p16 inhibits IL-6 expression in a
miR-146b-5p-dependent manner
We have recently shown that p16, in association
with Sp1 and CDK4, positively controls the expression
of miR-146b-5p [16]. Accordingly, we speculated that
miR-146b-5p might act as a downstream effector of
p16 in suppressing IL-6. Therefore, we first made use of
miRNA data bases to search for potential miR-146b-5p
binding sites in the 3′ UTR of the IL-6 transcript. We have
found an important site with high complementarity located
at site 68 with a miR SVR score of −0.1042 (Figure 3A).
Subsequently, we have tested the affect of p16 on the
expression of miR-146b-5p. Total RNA was prepared
from CAF-64, TCF-64, T64sh, T64C, C64O and C64C
cells, and the level of pre-miR-146b-5p was assessed by
qRT-PCR. The pre-miR-146b-5p level was 5.5 fold lower
in CAF-64 as compared to its corresponding TCF-64 cells
(Figure 3B). Similarly, the pre-miR-146b-5p level was
markedly decreased (3.5 fold) in T64sh as compared to
T64C cells (Figure 3B). However, the pre-miR-146b-5p
level was 3 fold higher in C64O cells as compared to their
relative control C64C (Figure 3B). Similar effect was
observed on the mature form of miR-146b-5p (Figure 3C).
This indicates that p16 induces miR-146b-5p in breast
stromal fibroblasts.
We have next investigated the effect
of miR-146b-5p on the expression of IL-6.
Therefore,  total  RNA  was  purified from TCF-64
cells expressing miRZip-146b-5p (miRZip), an anti-

miR146b-5p inhibitor, and miRZip-146b-5p-control
(miRZip-C), and qRT-PCR was performed to assess the
IL-6 mRNA level. Figure 3D shows that miR-146b-5p
inhibition increased 2.5 fold the IL-6 mRNA level  in
miRZip fibroblasts as compared to the control cells.
To confirm miR-146b-5p-dependent modulation of
IL-6 expression, we infected p16-defective CAF-64
cells, which express high level of IL-6, with either 
pre-miR-146b-5p (pre-miR) or a control lentivirusbased  vector  (pre-miR-C). Total RNA was prepared
and the IL-6 mRNA level was assessed by qRT-PCR.
Interestingly, ectopic expression of pre-miR-146b-5p
significantly repressed IL-6 as compared to control cells
(Figure 3D). These results indicate that miR-146b-5p
represses IL-6 expression in breast stromal fibroblasts.
To show the role of miR-146b-5p in mediating the
p16-related inhibition of IL-6 expression, we made use of
CAF-64 cells that ectopically express p16 (C64O), and
then miR-146b-5p was inhibited using miRZip-146b-5p
while miRZip-146b-5p-control was used for comparison.
Figure 3E shows increase in the IL-6 mRNA level in C64O
cells wherein miR-146b-5p was inhibited as compared
to control cells. This indicates that the p16-dependent
inhibition of IL-6 is mediated through miR-146b-5p.
To further confirm the role of miR-146b-5p in
repressing the expression of IL-6, we investigated the
potential contribution of the miR-146b-5p binding site
in the IL-6 mRNA 3′UTR on the regulation of IL-6
expression. To this end, wild-type IL-6 3′UTR or the
mutated sequence for the miR-146b-5p binding site
were inserted into a luciferase/Renilla reporter vector
(Figure  3F, upper panel) and were introduced into
miRZip and their corresponding control cells miRZip-C.
The reporter activity fused to the intact sequence of the
IL-6 3′UTR was significantly induced in miRZip cells
as compared to the control cells (Figure 3F, lower panel).
Similarly, the activity increased also when mutated
miR-146b-5p binding site was used in control cells
(Figure 3F, lower panel). Interestingly, the activity was
further higher by mutating the putative miR-146b-5p
binding site within the 3′UTR of the IL-6 mRNA in
miRZip cells (Figure 3F, lower panel). This demonstrates
that the miR-146b-5p-dependent repression of IL-6 is
mediated through binding to its seeding sequence in the
IL-6 3′UTR.

qRT-PCR. Figure 4A shows that miR-146b-5p inhibition
increased the mRNA levels of α-SMA, TGF-β1 and
SDF-1 (6.5, 4 and 2.5 fold, respectively) as compared to
the control cells. Next, pre-miR-146–5p was ectopically
expressed in CAF-64 cells, and then the α-SMA,
TGF-β 1 and SDF-1 mRNA levels were examined. The
relative levels of these mRNAs were strongly decreased
(6.5, 4.5 and 2.25 fold, respectively) in pre-miR-146b-5p
expressing cells as compared to the relative control cells
(Figure 4A). This indicates that miR-146b-5p plays an
important role in suppressing the expression of these
markers of active fibroblasts.
Next, the secreted levels of IL-6, TGF-β 1 and
SDF-1 were assessed by ELISA from SFCM collected
from  the  same cells described above. Figure 4B shows
that the secreted levels of these proteins were modulated
in a miR-146b-5p-dependent manner. Indeed, the secreted
levels of these proteins increased significantly in cells
where miR-146b-5p was inhibited, while they were
reduced in cells expressing pre-miR146–5p (Figure 4B).
This indicates that miR-146b-5p suppresses the secretion
of IL-6, TGF-β1 and SDF-1 in breast stromal fibroblasts.
To further confirm the role of miR-146b-5p
inhibition in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts,
we investigated the effect of this miRNA on the invasion/
migration of these cells. To this end, miRZip/miRZip-C as
well as pre-miR/pre-miRC fibroblast cells cultured in SFM
were added to the upper wells of the Boyden chambers
either matrigel-coated (invasion) or uncoated (migration),
and complete media (CpM) was placed in the lower
chambers of the inserts and used as chemoattractant. Cells
were incubated for 18 h, stained with Diff-Quick stain,
and then were counted. Figure 4C shows that the invasion
and migration abilities of miRZip cells were significantly
higher than the abilities of the corresponding control cells.
By contrast, the ectopic expression of pre-miR-146b-5p
reduced by 2.5 fold the invasiveness and the migratory
capabilities as compared to the control cells (Figure 4C).
These results indicate that miR-146b-5p, like p16,
suppresses both the migratory and the invasiveness
abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts.

miR-146b-5p inhibits the procarcinogenic effects
of breast stromal fibroblasts

Next, we investigated the effect of miR-146b-5p
down-regulation or up-regulation in breast stromal
fibroblasts on the invasion/migration abilities of breast
cancer cells. To this end, SFCM collected from miRZip,
miRZip-C, pre-miR and pre-miR-C cells were used to treat
MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 h. Subsequently, the migration/
invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed as described
above. Figure 4D shows that miRZip-SFCM enhanced the
invasion/migration abilities of breast cancer cells (3.35 fold
and 2.35 fold, respectively) as  compared to control

Since low p16 and high IL-6 levels are related
to active fibroblasts, we sought to study the role of
miR-146b-5p on the transactivation of breast stromal
fibroblasts. To this end, the previously prepared total RNA
from miRZip, miRZip-C, pre-miR and pre-miR-C cells
was used to assess the level of the α-SMA, SDF-1 and
TGF-β 1 mRNAs (3 major markers of myofibroblasts) by

cells that were exposed to miRZip-C-SFCM. However,
the invasion/migration of MDA-MB-231 cells were
significantly reduced upon incubation with SFCM from
pre-miR cells as compared to the corresponding control
cells (Figure  4D). This indicates that the expression of
miR-146b-5p in breast stromal fibroblasts inhibits the
paracrine pro-migration/invasion capabilities of cancer cells.
To investigate the possible implication of the pro-migratory/
invasive protein kinase AKT in this process, we tested the
activation of this protein in miRZip cells as compared to
control cells. Figure  4E shows that while miR-146b-5p
inhibition did not affect the level of total AKT, the level of
the active/phosphorylated form of the protein was strongly
increased as compared to control cells. This explains
the increase in the invasion/migration and suggests the
possible induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) process. To confirm this, we checked the
expression levels of epithelial and mesenchymal markers
in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to SFCM from miRZip
and  miRZip-C cells. Figure 4E shows that SFCM from
miR-146–5p-defective fibroblasts decreased the level of
E-cadherin, and increased N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail
(3 important markers of mesenchymal cells), as compared
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to their levels in control cells. Together, these results
indicate that deficiency of miR-146b-5p in breast stromal
fibroblasts triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in a paracrine
manner, which demonstrates their active status and their
non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressor functions.

miR-146b-5p level is reduced in breast
cancer-associated fibroblasts
Next, we sought to assess the level of miR-146–5p
in 10 CAF/TCF pairs from 10 different breast cancer
patients and 2 normal breast fibroblast cells (NBF2 and
NBF6) developed from normal tissues obtained upon
mammoplasty. Total RNA was extracted and specific
primers for pre-miR-146–5p as well as β-actin were
utilized for amplification by RT-PCR. Figure 5A shows a
clear decrease in the pre-miR-146–5p level in all CAFs,
as compared to their adjacent TCFs and normal fibroblasts
NBF-2 and NBF-6. To further confirm this, we assessed
the levels of mature miR-146b-5p in four CAF/TCF pairs
and NBF2 by qRT-PCR. Figure 5B shows that the level
of the mature form of miR-146–5p is also significantly
lower in CAFs as compared to their counterparts TCFs

addressed the molecular mechanism underlying the
paracrine signaling of p16-defective cells. We have first
shown that p16 is an inhibitor of the expression/secretion
of IL-6 in breast stromal fibroblasts. The fact that IL-6
is an important inflammatory cytokine suggests that p16
exerts also anti-inflammatory effects in breast stromal
fibroblasts through repressing IL-6. As a case in point,
induction of p16 into the synovial tissues suppressed
rheumatoid arthritis in animal models. Furthermore, p16
has anti-inflammatory functions in rheumatoid synovial
fibroblasts in vitro [23, 24]. Recently, it has been shown
that p16 suppresses IL-6 expression through IRAK1
degradation in LPS-stimulated macrophages, which are
the major source of inflammatory cytokines in inflamed
synovial tissues [25].
We have also shown that the increase in the
expression/secretion of IL-6 in p16-defective cells is
responsible for the paracrine pro-invasive/migratory
effects of these cells on breast cancer cells. This effect
was strongly reduced when IL-6 was specifically inhibited
by an anti-IL-6 inhibitory antibody in medium conditioned
with active p16-deficient stromal fibroblasts. This
suggests that IL-6 plays a major role in the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of p16-deficient cells.
Next, we addressed the molecular mechanism
underlying p16-dependent repression of IL-6 and have
shown that this control is mediated through miR-146b-5p.
We have recently shown that p16 is a positive regulator of
miR-146b-5p [16], and the present data indicate that this
microRNA inhibits IL-6, whose mRNA contains a specific

Curcumin induces miR-146b-5p
We have recently shown that curcumin induces p16
in breast stromal fibroblasts [22]. Since p16 promotes
miR-146b-5p expression, we sought to investigate the
possible curcumin-dependent induction of miR-146b-5p
and IL-6 inhibition. To this end, CAF-64 cells expressing
low level of p16 were treated with DMSO (control) or
challenged with curcumin (40 μM) for 24 h, and then total
RNA was purified and the levels of the CDKN2A and IL-6
mRNAs as well as mature miR-146b-5p were assessed
by qRT-PCR. Figure 6A shows curcumin-dependent
induction of CDKN2A (4 fold) and miR-146b-5p (5 fold).
On the other hand, curcumin suppressed IL-6  (4 fold),
as compared to control cells (Figure 6A). This shows
curcumin-dependent induction of miR-146b-5p and
suppression of IL-6 in active breast stromal fibroblasts.

DISCUSSION
We have recently shown that p16 is frequently
repressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and when
knocked-down leads to the transactivation of breast
stromal fibroblasts [3]. This suggests that this tumor
suppressor gene plays a major role in maintaining stromal
fibroblasts in an inactive state, which by inference,
represses carcinogenesis. In the present report, we

These results were confirmed by showing that the effect
of miR-146b-5p on the expression of IL-6 is mediated
through binding to its seeding sequence in the IL-6 3′UTR.
miR-146b-5p is a tumor suppressor microRNA,
which represses various pro-carcinogenic processes such
as migration/invasion, EMT [17–19] and also breast
cancer metastasis [20]. In addition, we present here the
first indication that miR-146b-5p is also involved in
repressing breast stromal fibroblasts. Indeed, while specific
inhibition of this miRNA reactivated these cells, ectopic
expression of pre-miR146b-5p inhibited the migration/
invasion abilities of active breast stromal fibroblasts and
suppressed their procarcinogenic effects. This indicates
that, in addition to its cell autonomous tumor suppressor
functions, miR-146b-5p has also non-cell-autonomous
activities through repressing the secretion of IL-6. Similar
effect has been shown for miR-26 in ERα-positive breast
tumors [26], and miR-31 and miR-214 in ovarian cancer
[27]. In addition, the expression of several miRNAs has
been shown to be modulated in CAFs as compared to their
adjacent normal fibroblasts [28]. This indicates that downregulation of miR-146b-5p in cancer-associated fibroblasts
is an important step during breast carcinogenesis. In fact,
we have found that CAFs from 12 breast cancer patients
expressed low level of miR-146b-5p as compared to their
adjacent counterparts present in histologically normal
tissues of the same breast. How miR-146b-5p controls

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the expression of these myofibroblast markers, namely
α-SMA, TGF-β1 and SDF1 ? We have recently shown
that miR-146b-5p represses AUF1, which is an activator
of these genes and a direct target of active STAT3 [5, 29].
Therefore, miR-146b-5p could indirectly suppresses the
expression of α-SMA, TGF-β1 and SDF1 through directly
targeting AUF1, or indirectly via IL-6/STAT3 (Figure 6B).
The effect on these genes may also explain the paracrine
pro-EMT and -metastasis effects of miR-146b-5p
(Figure 6B).
These results suggest that increasing the level of
miR-146b-5p in active stromal fibroblasts could be of
great therapeutic value. To address this question we have
shown that curcumin induces p16 and its downstream
target miR-146b-5p and suppresses IL-6 (Figure 6A).
This further  confirms the inhibitory effect of p16 and
miR146b-5p on IL-6. It is also plausible that curcumin
acts directly on the expression of miR-146b-5p. This
possible up-regulation of 2 important tumor suppressors,
p16 and miR-146b-5p, and the repression of IL-6, opens
new avenues for anti-cancer drug development through
targeting stromal fibroblasts and their paracrine effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells, cell culture and chemicals
Breast fibroblast cells were obtained, characterized
and cultured as previously described [30, 31]. Breast
tissues were obtained from patients who underwent

30013

Oncotarget

miR-146b-5p: 5′-CCTGGCACTGAGAACTGAAT-3′ and
5′- GCACCAGAACTGAGTCCACA-3′

surgery at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research
Center. Signed informed consent was obtained from
all the patients under the Research Ethical Committee
Project number RAC#2031091. While CAFs derived from
tumours, TCFs were developed from histologically normal
tissues located at least 2 cm away from tumours (invasive
ductal carcinomas). Processing of breast cancer tissues
was performed after routine examination by certified
anatomical pathologist using hematoxilin and eosin
(HE)-stained sections. NBF cells derived from healthy
age-matched females who performed breast reduction
surgery. In the present experiments NBFs, CAFs and their
corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously,
in the same conditions and at similar passages (4–8).
MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC, and were
cultured following the instructions of the company.
All supplements were obtained from Sigma
(Saint  Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotics and
antimycotics solutions, which were obtained from Gibco
(Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were maintained at 37°C
in humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

Transfection
CDKN2A-shRNA expressed in pRNAT-U6/Neo
vector (GenScript Corporation) and the corresponding
control plasmid were used to carry out transfection
using human dermal fibroblast nucleofector kit (Amaxa
Biosystems) following the protocol recommended by the
manufacturer.
pLKO.1-miRZip146b-5p and pCDH-pre-miR-146b5p plasmids were purchased from  System  Biosciences
(SBI, USA) and used to prepare the lentiviral supernatant.
Media was removed from the target cells and replaced
with lentiviral supernatant and incubated for 24 h.

Viral infection
Lentivirus based vector bearing CDKN2A–ORF
(pIRES) as well as it’s respective control (Addgene)
was used to prepare the lentiviral supernatant from
293FT cells. Lentiviral supernatants were collected 48 h
post-transfection, filtered and used for infection. 24 h
later, media was replaced with complete media and cells
were grown for 3 days.

Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblotting
This has been performed as previously described
[32]. Antibodies directed against N-cadherin, Vimentin
(RV202) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were  purchased from
Abcam (Cambridge, MA); Snail (C15D3), E-cadherin
(24E10) Akt, phospho-Akt (193H12) from Cell Signaling
(Danvers, MA); p16INK4a from BD Biosciences (San Jose,
CA) and Glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH, FL-335) was purchased from Santa Cruz
(Santa Cruz, CA).

Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of
PBS before being fixed by drop-wise addition of 3 ml of
100% methanol. Fixed cells were centrifuged, resuspended
in 50 ml of RNase (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 30 min
at room temperature, followed by addition of 1 ml of
0.1 mg/ml of propidium iodide (PI). Cells were analyzed
for DNA content by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson).
The percentage of cells in various cell-cycle phases
was determined by using Cell Quest software (Becton
Dickinson).

RNA purification, RT-PCR and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was purified using the TRI reagent
(Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and was treated with RNase-free DNase before cDNA
synthesis using the miScript® II RT Kit (Qiagen, UK) for
both miRNAs and mRNAs as previously described [16].

ELISA assays
Supernatants from 24 hr fibroblast cell cultures were
harvested, and ELISA was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems or RayBiotech
for MMP-2). The OD was used at 450-nm on a standard
ELISA plate-reader. These experiments were performed
in triplicates.

Chemotaxis and invasion assay
The 24-well BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion
Chambers were used as per the manufacturer guideline
(BD Bioscience). 2–4 × 105 cells were added to the upper

wells separated by an 8 micron pore size PET membrane
with a thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix
(for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes
were stained with Diff Quick stain (Fisher Scientific)
after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the
membrane with Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes
were cut and mounted on slides with oil, and cells that
had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted
using light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five
randomly selected fields (magnification; 40x). Each assay
was performed in triplicate.
