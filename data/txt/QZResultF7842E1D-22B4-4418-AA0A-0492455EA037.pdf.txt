in Keratinocytes Is Mediated in Part via
Interaction with Caveolin-1

Abstract
Connexin43 (Cx43) is known to have tumor-suppressive effects, but the underlying mechanisms are still
poorly understood. In keratinocytes, we previously showed that the COOH-terminal domain of Cx43 directly
interacts with the tumor suppressor Cav-1. We now show that rat epidermal keratinocytes (REK) that are
reduced in Cx43 present features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and are more invasive than their
control counterparts, whereas overexpression of Cx43 inhibited the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate
(TPA)– and epidermal growth factor (EGF)–induced invasive properties. Carbenoxolone did not alter the inhibitory effect of Cx43 against TPA- and EGF-induced cell invasion, indicating the involvement of a gap junctional intercellular communication–independent mechanism. Interestingly, the association of Cx43 with Cav-1
was found to be reduced after TPA and EGF treatment. Accordingly, the colocalization of Cx43 with Cav-1 was
diminished in cells from a human epidermal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as in sections from human
keratinocyte tumors, suggesting that Cx43/Cav-1 interaction plays a protective role against keratinocyte transformation. As opposed to cells that overexpress Cx43-GFP, invasion could be induced in rat epidermal keratinocytes that overexpressed a GFP-tagged truncated mutant of Cx43 (Δ244-GFP) that we previously showed
not to interact with Cav-1, as well as in cells that overexpressed Cx43-GFP but were reduced in Cav-1. Our data
show that Cx43 possesses tumor-suppressive properties in keratinocytes and provide the first evidence that
the Cx43/Cav-1 interaction is altered in keratinocyte transformation processes, as well as in human keratinocyte tumors, and that this association might play a role in Cx43-mediated tumor suppression. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Gap junctions are specialized intercellular membrane
channels that allow direct transfer of small molecules to selectively pass from one cell to another (1). Consequently, gap
junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) plays a critical
role in the coordination of development, tissue function, and
cell homeostasis (2). Gap junction channels are composed of
trans-membrane proteins, called connexins (Cx; ref. 2).
Among the 21 Cx members found in human, Cx43 is the most
abundant gap junction protein in a wide spectrum of tissues,
including the epidermis (3).
In cancer, loss of GJIC has been shown to facilitate tumorigenesis and enable the autonomous cell behavior associated

with transformed cells (4). Many tumor lines show deficient
or aberrant GJIC and/or loss of Cx expression, whereas restoration of Cx in cancer cells could reduce their neoplastic
potential (4). Decreased Cx expression has been observed
in human neoplasia of various organs (4, 5). Additionally, genetically engineered mice lacking Cx32 exhibit increased susceptibility to radiation and chemically induced liver and/or
lung tumorigenesis (6–8). These studies strongly suggest that
gap junctions serve a tumor suppressor role and whereas
Cx43 has long been viewed as a tumor suppressor, at least
in some tissues and microenvironments, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown.
We and others have reported that the tumor-suppressive
effects of Cx could be GJIC-independent (9–14). One proposed mechanism by which Cx may act as a tumor suppressor in a GJIC-independent manner is through binding to
proteins that regulate carcinogenesis. We have recently
shown by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) interacts with Cx43 in rat epidermal keratinocytes (REK) and that these molecules
colocalize in human epidermis (15). Our Far Western analysis
and utilization of Cx43 mutants revealed that this association
is direct and occurs through the COOH-terminal domain of
Cx43 (15). Interestingly, Cav-1 has been identified as a skin
tumor suppressor in vivo (16). In this study, we show that

Role of Cav-1 in Cx43 Tumor Suppression in Keratinocytes

Cx43 possesses tumor-suppressive functions in keratinocytes
through a process that is GJIC-independent and involves its
COOH-terminal domain. Our data provide the first evidence
that the Cx43/Cav-1 interaction is dysregulated in keratinocyte transformation processes in vitro, as well as their cosegregation profile in human skin cancer cell lines and
tumor biopsies. Together, these results suggest that the
tumor-suppressive properties of Cx43 involve its association
with Cav-1.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. REKs (17), as well as the cells derived from
normal human skin (Hs 456.Sk) and human epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-13) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen Corporation).
Hs 456.Sk cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection, whereas SCC-13 cells were a kind gift from
Dr. M. Denning (Loyola University, Chicago, IL).
shRNA constructs and retroviral infections. A Cx43targeted shRNA construct (GGTGTGGCTGTCAGTACTT),
which was typically the most efficient at reducing Cx43 level
in REKs, together with a control vector containing a nonsense
sequence, was used to make viral supernatants and infect
REKs (18). Generation of stable REK cell lines overexpressing
human Cx43-GFP or the Δ244-GFP Cx43 mutant was previously described (15, 19). Stable REK cell lines expressing
Cx43-GFP and reduced in Cav-1, together with cells that overexpress Cx43-GFP and a control vector containing a nonsense
sequence, were generated by retroviral infection (15).
Human tissue samples. Tissue collection was performed
at the Vancouver General Hospital Skin Care Center, University of British Columbia, in accordance with the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and as instituted
at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada. Tumor samples were collected during
resection of a cutaneous malignancy and, during the reconstructive phase, normal skin was taken from discarded tissue
remote to the primary tumor site. Samples were fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.
Characteristics of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
Cx43-reduced REKs were seeded at 2 × 105 cells in six-well
plates with or without coverslips. After 24 hours, cells were
treated with either a combination of transforming growth factor
β1 (TGF-β1; 3 ng/mL; R&D Systems) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 100 ng/mL, Sigma; ref. 20).
TPA, epidermal growth factor, and carbenoxolone treatments. Cells were starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.5%
FBS and then treated for 24 hours with 20 ng/mL of TPA in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, or with 10 ng/mL of human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; Clonetics)
in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS. For some experiments, cells were treated with 30 μmol/L of carbenoxolone
for 24 hours.
Western blotting. Cell lysates were obtained as previously
described (21). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with primary antibodies [1:1,000; vimentin

www.aacrjournals.org

(mAB3400, Millipore), E-cadherin (C20820, BD Transduction
Laboratories), Cav-1 (clone pAb, BD Transduction Laboratories), Cx43 (C6219, Sigma), or mouse anti-Cx43NT; ref. 22].
Infrared fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies [1:5,000,
IRDye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals) or Alexa 680 (Molecular Probes) anti-rabbit or anti-mouse] were used, and
immunoblots were quantified using the Odyssey InfraredImaging System (Licor). The membranes were reprobed
for β-actin (1:5,000, AC-15; Sigma) for normalizing protein
loading. The relative intensities of the bands represent the
average ± SD of at least three independent Western blots.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (23), and labeled
for Cav-1 (1:100). For immunolocalization of vimentin and
E-cadherin, cells were labeled with antivimentin (1:100,
MAB3400; Millipore) or anti–E-cadherin (1:100, C20820; BD
Transduction Laboratories). Alexa Fluor488–conjugated
(1:500; Invitrogen) and Texas red–conjugated anti-mouse
IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies.
Human skin and tumor sections (5 μm thick) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval and colabeling of Cx43 and Cav-1 were
performed (15). In all cases, Hoechst 33342 (Molecular
Probes) was used as a nuclear stain, and labeling was visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 META inverted confocal microscope. Where expression level comparisons were made by
densitometry between samples, image acquisition was performed in sequence with the microscope settings kept constant. Quantification was performed using the Zen LSM
Image Analysis software (Zeiss). Positive labeling in normal
epidermis was used to optimize the identification of cutoffs
for positive labeling in the absence of saturation as well as
background. The analyzed area in normal samples represents
the epidermis. In SCC samples, it represents the core of the
tumor, and in basal cell carcinomas (BCC), it represents
either the tumor core (“BCC core”) or the peripheral epidermis adjacent to the tumor (“BCC periphery”). Results are presented as the average of relative densitometric units ± SD of
between 8 and 15 different human samples.
Cell invasion. Cells (2 × 105) were plated in serum-free
DMEM on top of 8.0 μm pore size Transwell (BD Biosciences)
filters previously coated with Matrigel (BD Transduction
Laboratories) diluted 1:6 in serum-free DMEM. DMEM containing 10% FBS with or without 20 ng/mL of TPA or 0.5%
FBS with or without 10 ng/mL of EGF was added in the lower
chambers. After 24 hours, cells on the bottom of the filters
were fixed, stained with Hoechst 33342, and counted in 10 microscope fields using OpenLab software (Improvision). Results
are presented as the average number of cells that invaded and
represent the average ± SD of at least four independent assays.
Cell proliferation. Incubation with bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd), labeling of BrdUrd-positive nuclei, imaging, and
calculation of the proliferation index were done as previously
described (24).
Coimmunoprecipitation. Identical amounts of proteins
from each lysate were incubated overnight at 4°C in the
presence of 2 μg/mL of specific anti–Cav-1 antibodies

(mAb clone 2297, BD Transduction Laboratories; ref. 15).
Results are presented as a ratio of the intensity of Cx43 that
was coimmunoprecipitated to the intensity of Cav-1 immunoprecipitated, and represent the ratio ± SD of at least three
independent experiments.
Dye transfer. In the case of wild-type REKs, REKs expressing the empty vector (V) or REKs overexpressing Cx43-GFP,
one cell within a confluent cluster of cells was pressuremicroinjected with 1% Lucifer yellow (Molecular Probes;
ref. 15). At least 29 microinjections were performed for each
experimental condition.
Statistics. All statistical data were analyzed using twotailed Student's t test, except for the data comparing Cx43
and Cav-1 levels and their colocalization in human skin samples, which were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey's test for significance.

Results
Cx43-reduced REKs present epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition features. The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells lose their characteristic features and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, is a
fundamental process of cancer and involves a delocalization
of the cell membrane protein E-cadherin and the induction
of vimentin (20). Although TGF-β1 treatment with either
TPA or EGF has been reported to trigger EMT in the human
keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (20), the combination of TGF-β1
with TPA (Fig. 1A, left) or EGF (data not shown) did not alter
vimentin or E-cadherin levels in REKs. However, we observed
that Cx43-reduced REKs, which display ∼50% decrease in Cx43
(Fig. 1A) with little evidence for gap junction plaques (21), exhibited EMT features as defined by significantly more cells expressing vimentin compared with controls (Fig. 1A and B, red).
Vimentin expression was not further enhanced by treating
Cx43-reduced cells with TGF-β1 and TPA (Fig. 1A, left).
Although E-cadherin levels were not affected by the reduction
of Cx43 expression (Fig. 1A), its localization to the plasma
membrane (Fig. 1C, green, arrows) was less evident with
E-cadherin found in intracellular compartments (Fig. 1C,
arrowheads). These data indicate that the reduction of Cx43
induces EMT characteristics in REKs.
Reduction of Cx43 levels augments, whereas overexpression of Cx43-GFP inhibits, TPA- and EGF-induced cell
invasion. To assess whether Cx43 has tumor-suppressive
functions in keratinocytes, we used Cx43-reduced REKs and
REKs that overexpress Cx43-GFP and submitted them to
TPA- or EGF-induced invasion assays. TPA and EGF stimulated the invasion of wild-type and control REKs (Fig. 2, left),
which was further enhanced in Cx43-reduced cells (Fig. 2A
and B, left). Fittingly, TPA- and EGF-induced invasion were
inhibited in REKs that overexpressed Cx43-GFP (Fig. 2C and
D, left) indicating that an increased level of Cx43 was protective against processes associated with cell transformation.
To verify that the effects observed upon invasion were not
due to a modulation of REKs proliferation, BrdUrd incorporation was measured under the same conditions. EGF had no
effect on proliferation (Fig. 2B and D, right), although it was

4224

slightly reduced by TPA (Fig. 2A and C, right). Cx43-reduced
REKs proliferated less than their control counterparts in the
presence of TPA (Fig. 2A, right), whereas there was no diminution of cell proliferation in Cx43-GFP overexpressing cells
(Fig. 2C, right). Reduction or overexpression of Cx43 did not
affect cell proliferation in the presence of EGF (Fig. 2B and D,
right). These data indicate that the effects of modulating
Cx43 expression on REKs invasion are not due to proliferation. Together with our results showing that Cx43-reduced
REKs present EMT features, our invasion data indicate that
Cx43 possesses functions associated with tumor suppression
in keratinocytes.
Cx43-mediated inhibition of TPA- and EGF-induced
REKs invasion is GJIC-independent. To start assessing the
mechanism by which Cx43 protects from the induction of
keratinocyte invasion, we performed dye transfer assays on
TPA- or EGF-treated REKs. In agreement with previous reports (25, 26), both TPA (Fig. 3A) and EGF (Fig. 3B) reduced
GJIC. However, the overexpression of Cx43-GFP did not protect against this loss of communication. In addition, the gap
junction inhibitor carbenoxolone, which significantly reduced GJIC in REKs overexpressing Cx43-GFP (Fig. 3C) did
not alter the protective effect of Cx43 overexpression against
TPA- and EGF-induced invasion (Fig. 3D). Altogether, these
data reveal that the inhibitory effect of Cx43 against REKs
invasion is GJIC-independent.
TPA and EGF treatment reduce the Cx43/Cav-1 association in REKs. One proposed mechanism by which Cx may
act as a tumor suppressor in a GJIC-independent manner
is through binding to proteins that regulate tumorigenesis.
Because we previously showed that the skin tumor suppressor Cav-1 (16) interacts with Cx43 in keratinocytes (15), we
now wanted to determine whether this association was altered by TPA and EGF.
As shown in Fig. 4, whereas Cx43-GFP (green) is present at
the plasma membrane (arrows) and the intracellular compartment (arrowheads) of REKs, its colocalization with
Cav-1 (red) was primarily observed in the perinuclear region
(Fig. 4A and B, left, yellow, arrowheads; ref. 15). In accordance with published data (26–29), TPA induced Cx43-GFP
internalization, as the majority of Cx43-GFP was found in intracellular compartments (Fig. 4A, arrowheads) previously
identified as early and late endosomes, as well as lysosomes
(30). On the other hand, Cav-1 was largely redistributed to
the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A, arrows). In EGF-treated
REKs, which presented an elongated morphology (Fig. 4B),
Cx43-GFP was mostly found in intracellular punctuate structures (Fig. 4B, double arrows), such as early and late endosomes, and lysosomes (30). Cav-1 was also mainly detected
in intracellular punctuate structures of EGF-treated REKs
(Fig. 4B). Overlay images indicate that the majority of
Cx43/Cav-1 colocalization was lost in TPA- or EGF-treated
cells, but could still be observed in the intracellular compartment of a few cells (Fig. 4A and B; yellow, arrowheads).
In parallel studies, the coimmunoprecipitation of Cx43 with
Cav-1 was diminished in TPA- and EGF-treated REKs (Fig. 4C).
Although the total expression of Cx43 and Cav-1 remained unaltered (Fig. 4D), TPA and EGF transiently stimulated Cx43

Role of Cav-1 in Cx43 Tumor Suppression in Keratinocytes

Figure 1. Cx43-reduced REKs present
EMT features. Cx43 reduction did not
alter E-cadherin levels but increased
vimentin in untreated and TFG-β1/
TPA-treated cells (A, n = 3; *, P < 0.05).
A higher percentage of Cx43-reduced
REKs were vimentin-positive (B, red,
n = 3; *, P < 0.005; blue, nuclei; bar,

control cells (C, arrows) was greatly
diminished in Cx43-reduced REKs with
increased evidence for intracellular
localization (C, arrowheads; blue,

phosphorylation (31, 32). Together, these data revealed that
Cx43/Cav-1 association was reduced after treatment with
two inducers of transformation, TPA and EGF.
Cx43 and Cav-1 expression, as well as their colocalization, are reduced in human skin keratinocyte tumors. Our
next goal was to confirm that the diminution of Cx43/Cav-1
interaction seen in transformation-associated processes in
REKs is also observed in human skin cancer. Similar to REKs,
Cx43 (green) and Cav-1 (red) were found colocalized in a
perinuclear pattern in cells derived from normal human skin
(Hs 456.Sk; Fig. 5A). On the other hand, Cx43 and Cav-1 were
dispersed within the cytoplasm of cells from human epidermal SCC-13 (Fig. 5A). Cav-1 levels were particularly low compared with cells from normal skin and its colocalization with

Cx43 was not detected (Fig. 5A). To further investigate the
relationship between these two proteins, we assessed their
localization and expression in sections from human keratinocyte tumors (BCC and SCC). As we previously reported (15),
Cx43 (green) and Cav-1 (red) were detected, and partially colocalized, in the vital layers of human epidermis (Fig. 5B;
yellow, arrowheads). As compared with keratinocytes from
normal skin, Cx43 and Cav-1 levels were diminished in both
BCCs and SCCs (Fig. 5B and C). Interestingly, we observed
that the epidermis in the periphery (“P”) of the BCC cores
(“C”) exhibited a higher level of Cx43 than normal skin
(Fig. 5B and C), whereas Cav-1 expression was reduced in
both areas (Fig. 5B and C). Importantly, the colocalization
of Cx43 with Cav-1 was found to be significantly reduced

in BCCs and SCCs (Fig. 5B and D). These data revealed that
Cx43 and Cav-1 levels are diminished in human keratinocyte
tumors, as well as their colocalization. Altogether, these data
suggest that the Cx43/Cav-1 association is altered in human
skin cancer.
Overexpression of a truncated GFP-tagged Cx43 mutant
(Δ244-GFP), or the reduction of Cav-1 in Cx43-GFP overexpressing cells, does not protect against induction of cell
invasion. Because the interaction of Cx43 with Cav-1 is
altered in transformation-associated processes in vitro, a scenario likely to also occur in vivo, the next step was to determine whether Cav-1 was required for the tumor-suppressive
functions of Cx43. We have previously shown that a GFPtagged mutant of Cx43 (Δ244-GFP), truncated of its COOHterminal tail, does not interact with Cav-1 (15). As shown in

Fig. 6A (left), when expressed, this mutant was found in intracellular compartments (arrowheads) and at the plasma
membrane (arrows), similar to Cx43-GFP and endogenous
Cx43. Because the overexpressed Δ244-GFP Cx43 mutant
traffics to the plasma membrane, allows dye transfer (data
not shown), and does not affect endogenous Cx43 levels
and/or phosphorylation (Fig. 6A), we tested whether the
truncation of the COOH-terminal domain of Cx43 would alter its ability to regulate invasion. We found that the Δ244GFP–overexpressing REKs are more invasive in the presence
of 10% FBS, TPA, or EGF, as opposed to REKs that express
wild-type Cx43-GFP (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the
interaction of the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of
Cx43 with binding partners might be involved in regulating
the invasive properties of REKs.

level augments, whereas
overexpression of Cx43-GFP
inhibits, TPA- and EGF-induced

(B, left) significantly increased
the invasive properties of control
REKs (Ctl shRNA), which is further
enhanced in Cx43-reduced cells
(n = 4; *, P < 0.05). Fittingly,
overexpression of Cx43-GFP
inhibits TPA- and EGF-induced

opposed to wild-type REKs (WT) or

slightly reduced proliferation of

not in cells overexpressing Cx43GFP (C, right, n = 4; *, P < 0.05).

Role of Cav-1 in Cx43 Tumor Suppression in Keratinocytes

To specifically examine the role of Cav-1 in this process,
we used REKs that overexpress Cx43-GFP, but that were
reduced in Cav-1 by ∼55%. As shown in Fig. 6C, Cx43-GFP
localization as well as endogenous Cx43 level and/or phosphorylation were not affected by the diminution of Cav-1.
There was no significant TPA-linked induction of cell invasion by REKs overexpressing Cx43-GFP, but cells were reduced in Cav-1 when compared with control cells (Fig. 6D,
left). However, these cells were approximately twice more invasive then their control counterparts in the presence of EGF
(Fig. 6D, right). Although the reduction of Cav-1 level alone
might play a role in the induction of cell invasion, these results suggest cross-talk between Cav-1 and Cx43 in tumor
suppression.

Discussion

Figure 3. Cx43-mediated inhibition of TPA- and EGF-induced REKs
invasion is GJIC-independent. Wild-type (WT) REKs, REKs that express
the empty vector (V), or Cx43-GFP were treated with TPA (A) or EGF
(B) and microinjected with Lucifer yellow. REKs that overexpress
Cx43-GFP were treated with carbenoxolone in the presence of TPA or
EGF prior to microinjection (C) and during the invasion assay (D).

Although Cx43 has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor in many cell lines, to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study demonstrating that Cx43 possesses tumorsuppressive function in keratinocytes. We and others have
shown that the tumor-suppressive properties of Cx43 are
GJIC-independent in some cells and systems, and suggested a
possible involvement of binding to proteins that regulate carcinogenesis (9–14). However, no mechanism involving Cx43
binding partner has been identified to explain its tumorsuppressive function, which probably reflects the difficulty of
identifying biological functions associated with protein-protein
interactions. Thus, this work is the first to assign a biological
function to a Cx43 interaction with such a binding partner. Indeed, we now provide evidence that the interaction of Cx43
with Cav-1 is disrupted in processes associated with keratinocyte transformation, and that this interaction might play a role
in some of the tumor-suppressive properties of Cx43.
In this study, we used a Cx43- and Cav-1–positive, and noninvasive rat epidermal keratinocyte cell line that is phenotypically similar to basal keratinocytes in that they retain the
ability to differentiate into organotypic epidermis (33). We
subsequently used TPA and EGF to stimulate keratinocyte invasion to assess the effect of Cx43 overexpression or underexpression in a context where transformation is induced. Our
data using these cell lines suggest that the level of Cx43 is important in the regulation of cell transformation. Indeed, REKs
that are reduced in endogenous Cx43 present EMT features
and are more invasive than their control counterparts, whereas
overexpression of Cx43-GFP protects against the stimulation of
cell invasion. Accordingly, we and others suggest that forced
Cx43 expression has the potential to act as an inhibitor to tumor onset (11, 13, 34).
Although the transformation-protective effect of Cx43 could
be assigned to enhanced GJIC, our results indicate that the
mechanism at play in our model was GJIC-independent but
dependent on the COOH-terminal tail of Cx43. Although this
domain has been reported to be involved in the regulation of
glioma invasion (35), the underlying mechanism is still
unknown. The COOH-terminal tail of Cx43 is thought to be crucial in the control of gap junction function via phosphorylationdependent control of gap junction assembly and gating, and

experiments, the amount of Cx43
coimmunoprecipitated with Cav-1
was significantly reduced by TPA
and EGF (C). Data are expressed
as a ratio of the intensity of Cx43
that was coimmunoprecipitated
(top gels) to the intensity of Cav-1
immunoprecipitated (bottom gels;
n = 3–5; *, P < 0.05). As shown in
D, a transient phosphorylation of
Cx43, as evidenced by the
increase in the slower migrating
P species and a decrease in the
P0 species, was observed
following the addition of TPA
and EGF, whereas the overall
expression levels of Cx43 and
Cav-1 remained unchanged.

Role of Cav-1 in Cx43 Tumor Suppression in Keratinocytes

Figure 5. Cx43 and Cav-1 expression, as
well as their colocalization, are reduced in
human skin keratinocyte tumors. A, cells
derived from human normal skin (Hs 456.
Sk) or epidermal squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC-13) were colabeled with Cx43
(green) and Cav-1 (red). In Hs 456. Sk, but
not SCC-13 cells, Cx43 was found
colocalized with Cav-1 in a perinuclear
pattern (yellow, arrowheads). B, human
epidermis, BCC or SCC biopsies were
colabeled with Cx43 (green) and Cav-1
(red). In normal epidermis, Cx43 and
Cav-1 were detected in the vital layers
(between dashed and dotted lines) and
absent in the cornified layer (between
dashed lines). Cx43 was found partially
colocalized with Cav-1 in the epidermal
vital layers (yellow, arrowheads). In the
BCC cores (“C”, underneath the dotted
lines) and SCCs, Cx43 and Cav-1 could be
detected but their expression was lower
than that found in normal epidermis (B and
C; *, P < 0.05). Cx43 levels were higher
than that found in normal keratinocytes
in the epidermis in the periphery
(“P”, above the dashed lines) of the BCC
cores, whereas Cav-1 was lower (B and C;
*, P < 0.05). Overlay images indicate that
the colocalization of Cx43 with Cav-1
was reduced in keratinocyte tumors
(D; *, P < 0.05). Blue, nuclei; bar, 50 μm.

Figure 6. Overexpression of the Δ244-GFP Cx43 mutant, as well as the reduction of Cav-1 in Cx43-GFP overexpressing cells, do not protect against
induction of cell invasion. The Δ244-GFP Cx43 mutant was localized at the plasma membrane (arrows) and within the intracellular compartment
(arrowheads), which is similar to Cx43-GFP and Cx43 endogenously expressed in wild-type (WT) REKs and REKs that express the empty vector (V; A).
Overexpression of this mutant did not affect Cx43 expression or phosphorylation (A). Δ244-GFP–overexpressing REKs were more invasive in the presence
of serum, TPA, and EGF when compared with REKs that overexpress Cx43-GFP (B). Cx43-GFP localization was not altered in Cav-1–reduced REKs,
as Cx43-GFP was still found at the plasma membrane (C, arrows) and within intracellular compartments (C, arrowheads). REKs that overexpressed
Cx43-GFP, but are reduced in Cav-1, were more invasive than the control cells in the presence of EGF, but not TPA (D, *, P < 0.05). Blue, nuclei; bar, 20 μm.

Role of Cav-1 in Cx43 Tumor Suppression in Keratinocytes

through its interaction with key regulatory binding partners
(36, 37). Previously, we showed that the recombinant COOHterminal domain of Cx43 interacts directly with Cav-1 and that
the Δ244-GFP Cx43 mutant does not associate with this protein (15). Now we extend these findings to show that invasion
could be induced in cells that overexpress the Δ244-GFP mutant and that the overexpression of Cx43-GFP no longer protect
REKs against invasion when Cav-1 is reduced. Thus, we are the
first to suggest the importance of the Cx43 COOH-terminal tail
interaction with Cav-1 in cell transformation. The Δ244-GFP
mutant did not alter endogenous Cx43 levels and/or
phosphorylation status (Fig. 6A), nor did it inhibit GJIC in REKs
(data not shown). However, it could intermix with endogenous
Cx43 to reduce the overall ability of Cx43 oligomers to interact
with Cav-1, promoting the increase in cell invasion seen when
the truncated mutant was expressed in unstimulated cells, not
unlike the dominant-negative action of other Cx43 mutants
when coexpressed with endogenous Cx43 (38). All the evidence
indicates that Cx43/Cav-1 interactions play a protective role in
EGF-induced REK invasion. However, our findings showing
that the overexpression of the Δ244-GFP mutant does not protect against TPA-induced invasion and that REKs that overexpress Cx43-GFP, but that are reduced in Cav-1, are not invasive
in the presence of TPA suggest, as one would expect, that other
molecules aside from Cav-1 are likely involved in the Cx43linked regulation of carcinogenesis.
A large body of evidence has been accumulated supporting
a role for Cav-1 as a negative regulator of cell transformation
and tumorigenesis (16, 39–42). Results suggest that caveolins
are important signaling modulators within the context of caveolae, in which Cav-1 binding would serve to inhibit downstream signaling events (16). Furthermore, a role for Cx43 in
signal transduction, such as the regulation of TGF-β signaling (43, 44), well-known for its involvement in human cancer
(45), has also been suggested. Interestingly, some proteins are
known to bind both Cx43 and Cav-1, and to be present in
caveolae. For example, a previous study using lens epithelial
cells showed that activated PKCγ is recruited into Cav1–containing lipid, which stimulated its interaction with
Cx43 and Cav-1 and a possible reduction in Cx43 gap junction plaques (46). This raises the interesting possibility that
as part of a multiprotein complex, Cav-1 might direct Cx43
into caveolae and allow its transient association with, or
dissociation from, critical molecules that regulate carcinogenesis. Alternatively, Cav-1 may directly stimulate or inhibit
Cx43 or Cx43-associated proteins and thus regulate signaling
events downstream of Cx43. Conversely, the increase in Cx43
levels might also change the dynamic balance of interacting
proteins by sequestering more Cav-1 from a site of action or
from interacting with other proteins involved in carcinogenesis.

Although our current findings indicate that Cx43 protects
against TPA- and EGF-induced invasion through a mechanism that is GJIC-independent, we cannot rule out the regulation of GJIC by Cav-1 (15) in other tumor-suppressive
processes mediated by Cx43.
Although many groups have investigated the expression pattern of Cx43 in mouse models of skin cancer, studies on Cx
expression performed on human biopsies are rare. In keeping
with a previous report (47), we found that the Cx43 level was
significantly reduced in human keratinocyte skin tumors. Our
finding that Cx43 is increased in the epidermis surrounding
the BCC core might reflect a compensation mechanism to protect the surrounding tissue not unlike the previously described
effect of UV on Cx43 expression in human epidermis in vivo
(48). In addition to Cx43, we also looked at Cav-1 levels in skin
tumors, which have not been assessed until now. Our current
findings indicate that Cav-1 expression is significantly reduced
in both BCCs and SCCs, which is in accordance with a previous
study showing that Cav-1 is greatly reduced or absent in the
hyperproliferative basal cell layer of the skin of patients with
chronic plaque psoriasis (49). In keeping with our in vitro data
using REKs and human skin cell lines, our current findings reveal that the colocalization of Cx43 with Cav-1 is significantly
dysregulated in human keratinocyte skin tumors. Collectively,
these findings suggest a role for Cx43/Cav-1 interaction in processes inhibiting keratinocyte transformation in vivo.
In summary, we showed that Cx43 possesses tumorsuppressive functions in keratinocytes through a GJICindependent mechanism that involves its COOH-terminal
domain. Our data provide the first evidence that the interaction of Cx43 with Cav-1 is lost in keratinocyte transformation
processes in vitro, as well as in human keratinocyte tumors
in vivo. Collectively, our current findings suggest that Cx43
possesses tumor-suppressive functions, beyond its well-known
role in regulating GJIC, that involve its association with Cav-1.
