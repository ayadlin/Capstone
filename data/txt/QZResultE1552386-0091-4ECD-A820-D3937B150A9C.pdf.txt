ABSTRACT
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is known to play a critical role in
non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). Several EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs), such
as gefitinib, have been used as effective clinical therapies for patients with NSCLC.
Unfortunately, acquired resistance to gefitinib commonly occurs after 6–12 months
of treatment. The resistance is associated with the appearance of the L858R/T790M
double mutation of the EGFR. In our present study, we discovered a compound,referred
to as 244-MPT, which could suppress either gefitinib-sensitive or -resistant lung
cancer cell growth and colony formation, and also suppressed the kinase activity of
both wildtype and double mutant (L858R/T790M) EGFR. The underlying mechanism
reveals that 244-MPT could interact with either the wildtype or double-mutant EGFR
in an ATP-competitive manner and inhibit activity. Treatment with 244-MPT could
substantially reduce the phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signaling
pathways, including Akt and ERK1/2 in gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. It
was equally effective in suppressing EGFR phosphorylation and downstream signaling
in NL20 cells transfected with wildtype, single-mutant (L858R) or mutant (L858R/
T790M) EGFR. 244-MPT could also induce apoptosis in a gefitinib-resistant cell line
and strongly suppress gefitinib-resistant NSCLC tumor growth in a xenograft mouse
model. In addition, 244-MPT could effectively reduce the size of tumors in a gefitinibresistant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) SCID mouse model. Overall, 244-MPT
could overcome gefitinib-resistance by directly targeting the EGFR.

INTRODUCTION

NSCLC patients exhibiting elevated EGFR expression [4].
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERKs and the PI3-K/Akt pathways
are two primary signaling networks activated by EGFR
[5, 6]. These pathways drive tumor cell proliferation,
survival, invasion and angiogenesis [7]. In NSCLC,
mutations are frequently observed in the EGFR [8].
Classical-activating mutations include deletions in exon
19 and a point mutation of L858R, which constitute about
90% of all EGFR-activating mutations [9].

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers
in the United States. In 2015, approximately 240,000
cases will be diagnosed [1]. Non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer (87%) and the
overall 5-year survival rate for NSCLC is only 18.2% [2].
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) reportedly
plays a critical role in NSCLC [3], with about 40–80% of

Because of the crucial role of EGFR in
tumorigenesis, several EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), including gefitinib and erlotinib, have been
developed as effective clinical therapies for patients
with activating mutations. The magnesium-ATP-binding
pocket of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain can be
blocked by TKIs, which means that the ligand-induced
receptor auto-phosphorylation function is obstructed
by the binding of a TKI to the tyrosine kinase domain.
This binding disrupts tyrosine-kinase activity, thereby
inhibiting intracellular downstream signaling [10].
Unfortunately, acquired resistance to the TKI often
manifests within 6 to 12 months of treatment [11]. Patients
with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib exhibit
a secondary mutation of EGFR in exon 20, which leads
to a substitution of methionine for threonine at position
790 (T790M) in the kinase domain [12]. Thr790 of the
EGFR is considered to be a ‘gatekeeper’ residue, which
is an important determinant of inhibitor specificity in the
ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR [10]. Research results
have shown that the T790M mutation causes resistance to
TKIs by increasing the affinity of EGFR for ATP [7, 10].
Therefore, finding a drug that can inhibit the double
mutant EGFR (L858R/T790M) to overcome gefitinib
resistance in NSCLC treatment is greatly needed. By
using computational methods to screen for small molecule
inhibitors in the ZINC natural compound database, we
identified 244-MPT (2-[4-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-1Hpyrazol-3-yl]-5-(p-tolylmethoxy)phenol), as a potential
EGFR inhibitor that could be used in NSCLC therapy.
We found that this compound could suppress gefitinibsensitive and -resistant lung cancer cell growth by
inhibiting EGFR activity and its downstream signaling
pathways in vitro and ex vivo. Moreover, we observed that
244-MPT could strongly suppress gefitinib-resistant lung
cancer tumor growth in both a mouse xenograft model and
a PDX model.

with different concentrations of 244-MPT for 24 or 48 h.
The results indicated that 244-MPT had no cytotoxicity at
concentrations less than 40 μM (Supplementary Figure 1).
Next, human H1975 lung cancer cells, which are gefitinibresistant, and HCC827 gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell
lines, were treated with different doses of 244-MPT. Our
results revealed that gefitinib [14] and 244-MPT strongly
inhibited gefitinib-sensitive HCC827 cell proliferation
and colony formation (Figure 1B, 1C). Notably, 244-MPT
also markedly suppressed H1975 gefitinib-resistant cell
proliferation and colony formation dose-dependently,
whereas gefitinib was ineffective (Figure 1D, 1E). These
data reveal that 244-MPT might be a potential molecule to
overcome gefitinib resistance in NSCLC.

244-MPT binds and inhibits both wildtype and
mutant EGFR activities in vitro and ex vivo
To better understand the mechanism of the
interaction of 244-MPT with wildtype and mutant
EGFR, we conducted an in silico docking assay. The
computational binding models showed that several
hydrogen bonds were formed between 244-MPT and
the EGFR ATP pocket in either the wildtype or mutant
protein (Figure  2A, 2B). To further confirm our result,
we conducted an energy minimization and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation (Supplementary Videos S1
and S2). We compared the binding mode changes after
5 ns MD of 244-MPT and gefitinib. Results showed that
after 5 ns MD, 244-MPT still formed some hydrogen
bonding, hydrophobic and other interactions with double
mutant EGFR (L858R/T790M), whereas gefitinib did not
form hydrogen bonds, but only the hydrophobic and other
interactions with double mutant (L858R/T790M) EGFR
(Supplementary Figure 2). This result indicated that 244MPT can bind with double mutant (L858R/T790M) EGFR
tightly. An ATP competition assay further showed that
either wildtype (Figure 2C) or mutant EGFR (Figure 2D)
was pulled down by 244-MPT-conjugated Sepharose 4B
beads but not Sepharose 4B beads alone. Moreover, the
binding ability of 244-MPT with either EGFR wildtype
or mutant was reduced in the presence of ATP (Figure 2C,
2D). Furthermore, we observed ex vivo binding between
244-MPT and EGFR in 293T cells overexpressing
exogenous wildtype or mutant EGFR (Figure 2E). 244MPT could strongly bind with wildtype, the L858R single
mutant EGFR or the L858R/T790M double mutant EGFR,
whereas the binding affinity between gefitinib and the
double mutant EGFR was much weaker (Figure 2E). To
elucidate the effect of 244-MPT against EGFR wildtype
and mutant activity, we conducted in vitro kinase assays.
As predicted, either 244-MPT or gefitinib strongly
inhibited wildtype EGFR kinase activity (Figure 2F),
whereas 244-MPT also substantially inhibited the kinase
activity of the EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant
while gefitinib was ineffective (Figure  2G). All these

244-MPT, inhibits anchorage-independent
growth and proliferation of both
gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant lung cancer cells
Over 50% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients exhibit elevated EGFR expression. Notably,
most lung cancer patients expressing the T790M EGFR
mutation respond to initial gefitinib treatment but
eventually acquire resistance [13]. Thus, identifying a
drug that can overcome gefitinib resistance in NSCLC
is crucial. 244-MPT (Figure 1A) was identified through
our computational screening as a novel compound that
might target both wildtype and mutant EGFR (L858R/
T790M). To determine whether 244-MPT exerted any
cytotoxic effects against normal lung cells, MRC-5 cells,
a human normal lung fibroblast cell line, were treated

244-MPT suppresses tumor growth of
gefitinib-resistant cells in a xenograft mouse model

results indicate that 244-MPT interacts with wildtype or
mutant EGFR at the ATP-binding pocket and inhibits their
respective kinase activity.

For many years, mouse xenograft models implanted
with human cancer cells lines have been used extensively
for predicting responsiveness to anticancer target agents.
Based on our findings thus far in vitro and ex vivo, we
next determined the chemotherapeutic effect of 244MPT in vivo. Using an athymic nude xenograft mouse
model, results showed that 244-MPT suppressed H1975xenograft tumor growth, whereas gefitinib was ineffective
in reducing tumor size (Figure 5A, 5B). The highest dose
of 244-MPT (200 mg/kg) treatment showed significantly
more inhibition compared to the lowest dose (50 mg/kg).
After mice were sacrificed, tumors were weighed and these
results were confirmed (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B).
The body weights of all animals remained stable after
daily treatment by oral gavage with 244-MPT, gefitinib,
or vehicle control (Figure 5C), which suggested that the
dose of 244-MPT used for the experiment had no toxicity
to the mice. To further confirm that the antitumor effect
of 244-MPT was associated with its inhibition of EGFR,
an immunohistochemical analysis was performed. These
results showed that Ki-67 expression and phosphorylation
of EGFR, Akt and ERK1/2 were each significantly
suppressed in the 244-MPT treated-groups compared with
the vehicle- or gefitinib-treated group (Figure 5D). These
results clearly indicated that 244-MPT exerts a substantial
chemotherapeutic effect to overcome gefitinib-resistant
xenograft growth in mice acting mainly through the
suppression of EGFR activation.

244-MPT attenuates EGFR signaling in both
gefitinib-sensitive and -resistance NSCLC cells
Both the Akt/mTOR and the MAPK cascades
are primary downstream pathways of EGFR signaling
[15]. We observed persistent phosphorylation of Akt
and ERK1/2 despite gefitinib treatment in H1975
cells (Figure  3A 1st lane); whereas gefitinib abolished
phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in the sensitive
HCC827 cells (Figure 3B 1st lane). These data suggest
the presence of persistently activated EGFR (L858R/
T790M)/Akt and EGFR (L858R/T790M)/ERKs cascades
in gefitinib-resistant cells. A previous report [10] and
our data showed that the T790M mutation reduced the
effectiveness of gefitinib to compete for binding at the
ATP pocket, but 244-MPT showed much stronger binding
affinity compared with gefitinib in either EGFR wildtype
or mutant cells (Figure 2E). Thus to further study the effect
of 244-MPT, we examined the effect of different doses of
244-MPT on phosphorylation of EGFR, Akt and ERK1/2
in HCC827 and H1975 cells. Western blot results showed
that 244-MPT strongly suppressed phosphorylation
of EGFR, Akt and ERK1/2 in both gefitinib-sensitive
and -resistant NSCLC cells (Figure 3A, 3B). We then
established NL-20 cells stably overexpressing wildtype
or mutant EGFR (Figure 3C) and examined the effect of
244-MPT. Similar effects of 244-MPT and gefitinib were
observed in the NL-20 cells overexpressing wildtype, the
L858R single mutant EGFR or the L858R/T790M double
mutant EGFR (Figure 3D).

244-MPT suppresses tumor growth in a
gefitinib-resistant NSCLC PDX model
The PDX model is based on the transfer of
primary tumors directly from the human patient into
an immune deficient mouse. To further investigate the
chemotherapeutic effect of 244-MPT and its clinical
relevance, we created a model that mimicked a patient
who was sensitive to gefitinib, treated with gefitinib for
a certain period, and finally followed by the emergence
of gefitinib-resistance. In the gefitinib-resistant PDX
model, results showed that 244-MPT suppressed
gefitinib-resistant NSCLC PDX tumor growth with no
toxicity, whereas gefitinib had no effect (Figure 6A–6C).
Additionally, an immunohistochemical analysis showed
that Ki-67 and phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2
were each significantly suppressed in the 244-MPT
treated-groups compared with the vehicle- or gefitinibtreated group (Figure 6D). All these data indicated that
244-MPT might be a very promising novel drug candidate
to be evaluated in clinical trials.

244-MPT induces apoptosis in gefitinib-resistant
cells
Induction of apoptosis has been a key strategy for
effective cancer therapy. We used Annexin V staining and
flow cytometry to further examine whether 244-MPT could
induce apoptosis in H1975 gefitinib-resistant cells. Data
showed that treatment with 244-MPT caused significant
apoptosis in this cell line, whereas gefitinib was less
effective (Figure 4A, 4B). In addition, treatment of H1975
cells with 244-MPT induced the cleavage of caspase-3
and PARP, which are markers of apoptosis (Figure 4C).
Treatment with 244-MPT increased the expression of the
pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, and reduced the expression of
the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (Figure 4C). The TUNEL
assay provided similar results showing that treatment with
244-MPT caused substantially more apoptosis compared
to the untreated control or gefitinib treatment (Figure 4D).

DISCUSSION

244-MPT is a novel EGFR inhibitor with a distinct chemical
structure from other TKIs (Figure 1A), and it markedly
inhibited anchorage-independent growth of both gefitinibsensitive and –resistant NSCLC cell lines (Figure 1C, 1E).
In silico docking and in vitro kinase assay results
(Figure 2) together with ex vivo cellular phosphorylation
data (Figure 3) collectively showed that 244-MPT is
highly potent against both EGFR wildtype and T790M
mutant expressing cells. Moreover, the profound antitumor activity of 244-MPT across xenografts expressing
T790M EGFR in vivo suggests a great potential to target
T790M-expressing tumors (Figure 5). We also imitated in
mice the clinical process of acquiring gefitinib-resistance.
Continuous treatment of SCID mice implanted with
human gefitinib-sensitive tumors established a gefitinibresistant NSCLC PDX mouse model. When these mice
were treated with 244-MPT, similar results were obtained
as for the T790M xenograft mouse model (Figure 6). This
result clearly suggests that 244-MPT could effectively
reduce gefitinib-resistant patient-derived tumor size. In
the PDX model, solid tumor fragments are implanted
into immunodeficient mice. This model is considered
to be highly relevant to real human tumor growth
because it develops a functional stroma and vasculature,
microenvironment and displays central necrosis and reflects
tumor differentiation. These tumors often maintain the
original molecular characteristics and heterogeneity of the
original patient tumor better than tumors generated from
transplanted cell lines. Many factors, such as angiogenesis,
growth factors, stroma and microenvironment can affect
tumor growth and the effect of a drug. This explains
why PDX data are more convincing than single cell line
xenografts. Thus, the effect of 244-MPT on tumor growth
might be affected by these factors but its effect on its
targeted markers could very likely be similar in cells and
whole tumors. The PDX model has strong predictive power
for translating preclinical efficacy into clinical outcome
[29]. Although 244-MPT exhibited a little less inhibitory
effect in the PDX model compared to the gefitinib-resistant
H1975 cell line xenograft model, but still strongly inhibited
gefitinib-resistant patient-derived tumor growth, this
result supported 244-MPT as a novel and effective drug,
providing a good foundation for further study.
The T790M mutation confers drug resistance by
increasing the ATP affinity of the oncogenic L858R mutant
EGFR by more than an order of magnitude, thereby
reducing the effectiveness of TKIs to compete for binding
at the ATP pocket [10, 28]. Our computational prediction
and pull-down assay results clearly confirmed that 244MPT could bind to either the wildtype or T790M EGFR
(Figure 2). To support our hypothesis, computational
simulation results showed that after performing a 5 ns MD
simulation, 244-MPT, but not gefitinib, still binds tightly
with the double mutant EGFR, 4 (Supplementary Figure 2).
With the aid of supercomputers, the MD simulation could
be produced easily and provided more evidence explaining

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
among males in both highly developed and less developed
countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading
cause of cancer death among females in more developed
countries [16]. An estimated 1.8 million new lung cancer
cases occurred in 2012 worldwide, accounting for
about 13% of total cancer diagnoses [16]. Non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type
of lung cancer, accounting for more than 80% of all cases
[17]. Approximately 70–75% of patients with NSCLC
have advanced stage disease when first diagnosed [18].
Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard care for
patients with advanced NSCLC. Historically, all patients
were treated with the same systemic regimens regardless
of histological subtype or molecular features [19].
However, chemotherapy is fraught with harmful  side
effects such as fatigue, myelosuppression, neutropenia,
diarrhea and nausea [20]. Moreover, data indicate that
the response rate of advanced stage NSCLC patients
to current standard combination chemotherapy is only
20–25% and the estimated 2- or 5-year survival rates
are only 15- or 2%, respectively [17, 21, 22]. Novel
therapies include the targeting of biomarkers, such as
EGFR, that are commonly overexpressed in lung cancers.
EGFR mutation is identified as a cause of NSCLC and
its activation corresponds to poor prognosis [23]. The
in-frame deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation that
substitutes Leu858 with arginine account for almost of
all the activating mutations [24]. These mutations cause
constitutive activation of kinase activity by destabilizing
the auto-inhibited conformation of the kinase, which
initially confers sensitivity to the TKIs. TKIs, like gefitinib
and erlotinib, were found to be most effective in patients
who harbor somatic activating mutations [25]. TKIs are
generally less toxic and more efficacious than standard
chemotherapy [26].
Unfortunately, the efficacy of TKI treatment often
has limited duration because of the emergence of drug
resistance conferred by a second mutation, the substitution
of threonine 790 with methionine (T790M), which
accounts for about 50% of all resistance to gefitinib and
erlotinib [27]. In randomized studies, the median overall
survival of patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer
receiving first-line EGFR TKIs is 19 to 36 months, while
median progression-free survival is about a year. In more
than half of patients, tumor cells at the time of progression
harbor a second-site T790M mutation, which confers
resistance to EGFR TKIs [28]. No specific treatments for
patients with acquired resistance to current EGFR TKIs
have yet been approved.
We performed computer screening, which designed
to specifically target wildtype and L858R/T790M mutant
EGFR, using the ZINC natural database and 244-MPT
was listed at the top of the screening results. We show that

our results. The EGFR transmits activating signals to
various downstream signaling molecules and the two main
pathways include the PI3-K/Akt and MAPK pathways.
Previous reports show that the T790M mutation activates
the kinase activity of EGFR at least 5-fold compared
with the wildtype enzyme [10]. Our results indicated
that 244-MPT effectively attenuated the phosphorylation
of Akt and ERK1/2 in both wildtype and T790M mutant
lung cancer cells and also reduced their viability and
increased apoptosis compared with the traditional TKI,
gefitinib (Figures 3, 4). Up to 20% of EGFR-mutated lung
cancers that have developed acquired resistance to TKIs
also exhibit MET amplification in this setting [30,  31].
When patients acquire resistance and harbor both T790M
mutation and MET amplification, a c-MET inhibitor
alone is not effective [32]. MET amplification can lead to
persistent activation of the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway,
contributing to tumorigenesis [27]. The inhibition of
EGFR wildtype and T790M mutant by 244-MPT strongly
suppresses Akt activation, suggesting that 244-MPT might
also affect MET [30, 31]. We will study this in more detail
in the future.
Clearly, finding an agent that can more effectively
target the T790M EGFR mutant for advanced or recurrent
NSCLC is critical. Our results strongly support the idea
that 244-MPT could act as an effective EGFR wildtype
and T790M inhibitor that can overcome TKI resistance in
NSCLC treatment, which could then lead to delayed disease
progression and ultimately increased survival benefit.

Cells (8 × 103) were suspended in 1 ml BME/10%
FBS/0.33% agar with different concentrations of 244-MPT,
vehicle or gefitinib and plated on 3  ml of solidified
BME/10% FBS/0.5% agar with the same concentration
of 244-MPT, vehicle or gefitinib in each well of 6-well
plates and cultured for 2 to 3 weeks. Colony numbers
were determined by a microscope using Image-Pro Plus
software (Media Cybernetics, Inc. Rockville, MD).

In vitro EGFR kinase assay
The in vitro EGFR kinase assay was conducted
following the instructions provided by Millipore. Active
EGFR (100 ng) was mixed with different concentrations
of 244-MPT or 1 µM gefitinib. The mixture was incubated
with 500 µM angiotensin II for 5 min at room temperature,
followed by incubation with 10 µl of an ATP mixture
(25 mM MgAc and 0.25 mM ATP containing 10 µCi
[γ-32P] ATP) for 20 min at 30°C and then 25 µl of reaction
mixture were transferred onto P81 papers. The papers
were washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid twice and then
with acetone once. The radioactive incorporation was
determined using a scintillation counter.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
244-MPT was synthesized in-house following a
protocol reported for similar compounds [33]. Gefitinib
was from AstraZeneca UK Ltd (Macclesfield, UK). CNBractivated SepharoseTM 4B beads were purchased from GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences (Uppsala, Sweden). The primary
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Biotechnology
(Beverly, MA). The antibodies against β-actin and
α-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA) and the Ki-67 antibody was obtained from
Thermo Scientific (Fremont, CA). All active proteins were
purchased from EMD Millipore Corporation (Temecula,
CA). JetPEI poly was from Polyplus-transfection SAS
(Saint Quentin Yvelines, France).

Molecular modeling
The X-ray crystal structure of EGFR wildtype and
double mutant was obtained from the RCSB Protein
Data Bank [34]. These two structures were prepared
under the standard procedure of the Protein Preparation
Wizard in Schrödinger Suite 2014 [35]. Hydrogen atoms
were added consistent with a pH of 7 and all water
molecules were removed. Finally, an ATP binding sitebased receptor grid of each kinase was generated for
screening. The ZINC natural compound database was
prepared using LigPrep of the Schrödinger Suite 2014
utilizing default parameters for screening. Screening was
accomplished using the program Glide in Schrödinger
Suite 2014 utilizing default parameters under the
standard precision (SP) mode followed by the extra
precision (XP) mode.

Cell culture
NL20, MRC-5, HCC827, and H1975  human
lung normal and cancer cell lines and 293T cells were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC; Manassas, VA). All cells were cytogenetically
tested and authenticated before freezing. All cell culture
conditions were performed following ATCC’s instructions.

cells were fixed and disrupted, then equilibrated at
room temperature for 5 min, followed by the addition
of incubation buffer (45  μl equilibration buffer,  5  μl
nucleotide mix, 1 μl rTdT enzyme) and incubated at 37°C
for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by incubation with
2 × SSC (300 mM sodium chloride, 30 M sodium citrate)
for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were
stained with DAPI (1 μg/μl) and the number of TUNEL
positive cells was determined by laser scanning confocal
microscopy (Nikon C1S1 Confocal Spectral Imaging
System, Nikon Instruments Co., Melville, NY).

To further study the binding of double mutant
(L858R/T790M) EGFR with 244-MPT binding at the
ATP-binding pocket, a loop energy minimization and MD
were conducted in 5 ns by default parameters using the
Impact software program from Schrödinger Suite 2014.
The binding mode before and after MD was compared.

Western blot
The protein concentration in cell lysates
was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Lysates were subjected to
SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes (EMD Millipore Corporation).
Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and
incubated with specific primary antibodies at 4°C
overnight. This was followed by incubation with the
appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibody for hybridization. Protein bands
were visualized with a chemiluminescence reagent (GE
Healthcare Biosciences).

Xenograft mouse model
Athymic nude mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased
from Charles River and maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions. Mice were divided into 4
groups (n = 10 mice per group). The 4 groups were: 1)
vehicle control; 2) 150  mg/kg gefitinib; 3) 50  mg/kg
244-MPT; and 4) 200  mg/kg 244-MPT. H1975  human
lung cancer cells (2 × 106 in 0.1 ml) were inoculated
subcutaneously into the right flank of all mice. Treatment
was initiated when tumors reached a mean tumor volume
of 25 mm3. Treatment with 244-MPT, gefitinib or vehicle
control (dimethyl sulfoxide 5% and PEG400 95%) was
administered daily by oral gavage. Body weights and tumor
measurements were determined 3 times a week, and tumor
volume was calculated from measurements of 3 diameters
of individual tumors based on the following formula:
tumor volume (mm3) = length × width × height × 0.52. All
studies were performed according to guidelines approved
by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.

In vitro ATP competitive binding and ex vivo
pull-down assays
The 244-MPT-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads
were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(GE Healthcare Biosciences). For the pull-down assay, a
293T cell lysate (500 μg) was incubated with 244-MPTSepharose 4B beads or Sepharose 4B beads only (negative
control) at 4°C overnight. Binding results were analyzed
by Western blotting. For ATP competition assays, an active
kinase with different concentrations of ATP was incubated
at 4°C overnight. Then 244-MPT–conjugated Sepharose
4B or Sepharose 4B beads (negative control) were added
followed by incubation at 4°C for 2 h. The proteins bound
to the beads were analyzed by Western blotting.

Establishment of the gefitinib-resistant NSCLC
PDX model
The gefitinib-resistant NSCLC PDX model was
established by exposure to stepwise increasing doses
of gefitinib over time. Briefly, PDXs were initiated by
subcutaneous implantation of human NSCLC fragments
(~2–3  mm; gefitinib sensitive) coated in Matrigel and
implanted through subcutaneous ﬂap incisions in C.B17 severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice (4–6
weeks old). Mice were treated with gefitinib (10 mg/kg)
by oral gavage for 10 to 15 days. Subsequently, PDXimplanted mice were fed a normal diet for 3 to 4 days
without gefitinib and then gefitinib was administered by
oral gavage (10 mg/kg) another 10 to 15 days. When the
xenograft NSCLC tumor reached 500 mm2, the mice were
sacrificed and the tumors were divided into ~2–3  mm
fragments and implanted into 8 to 10 additional SCID
mice for further generations of these tumors. In these 2nd
generation gefitinib-treated mice, the gefitinib dose was
increased to 50 mg/kg by oral gavage for 10 to 15 days

Apoptosis assay
Cells (0.75 × 106) were seeded in 60-mm dishes
and incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator
and then treated for 24 h with different concentrations of
244-MPT. Then the cells were fixed with ice-cold 70%
ethanol at 20°C overnight. After staining with Annexin V,
apoptosis was analyzed by 2-color flow cytometry.

TUNEL assay
Apoptosis was determined using the DeadEndTM
Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after treatment,

followed by normal diet (no gefitinib treatment) for 3 to
4 days and then the gefitinib treatment by oral gavage
(50 mg/kg) was administered for another 10 to 15 days.
When these tumors reached 500 mm3, the mice were
sacrificed and the tumors were divided into ~2–3  mm
fragments and implanted into 8 to 10 additional SCID
mice for further generations of these tumors. In these
3rd generation gefitinib-treated mice, the gefitinib dose
was increased to 100 mg/kg by oral gavage for 10 to 15
days followed by normal diet (no gefitinib treatment) for
3 to 4 days and then gefitinib treatment by oral gavage
(100 mg/kg) was administered for another 10 to 15
days. After three consecutive mouse-to-mouse passages,
the gefitinib-resistant NSCLC PDX models became
stable and were ready for further study. These studies
were approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou
University and the patients whose tumor samples were
involved in the study were completely informed and
provided consent.

Each experiment was performed 3 times
independently. All quantitative data are expressed as
mean values ± standard deviation (S.D.) unless otherwise
indicated and significant differences were determined by
the Student t test or one-way ANOVA. A p value of < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

In vivo gefitinib-resistant NSCLC PDX model

FUNDING

After establishing the gefitinib-resistant NSCLC
PDX model, we generated enough mice to passage the
tumor fragments to 30 mice for 244-MPT treatment in an
in vivo PDX study. Mice were divided into 3 groups (n =
10 mice per group). The 3 groups were: 1) vehicle control;
2) 100  mg/kg gefitinib; and 3) 200  mg/kg 244-MPT.
Once the tumor volumes reached approximately 25 mm3,
mice were treated by oral gavage with vehicle control
(dimethyl sulfoxide 5% and PEG400 95%), gefitinib
or 244-MPT. Body weights and tumor measurements
were performed twice a week and tumor volume was
calculated from measurements of 3 diameters of individual
tumors based on the following formula: tumor volume
(mm3) = length × width × height × 0.52. All studies
were performed according to guidelines approved by the
Zhengzhou University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
