Abstract
There is a need to identify more effective drugs for the
treatment of ovarian cancer as it is the leading cause of death
among gynecologic tumors. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a
natural retinoid, arrests the growth of CA-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells in G0-G1. Because the insulin-like growth factor-I
receptor has been implicated in the proliferation of various
tumors, we investigated its potential role in the suppression of ovarian cancer cell growth by ATRA. Our studies revealed that insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein levels
decrease in CA-OV3 cells on ATRA treatment, whereas no
differences in IRS-1 levels were seen in the ATRA-resistant
SK-OV3 cells. Moreover, CA-OV3 clones overexpressing IRS-1
were growth inhibited less by ATRA, whereas SK-OV3 clones
in which levels of IRS-1 were reduced by expression of antisense IRS-1 became sensitive to growth inhibition by ATRA
treatment. Studies to determine the mechanism by which
ATRA reduced IRS-1 expression showed that ATRA altered
steady-state levels of IRS-1 mRNA and the stability of IRS-1
protein. Finally, the role of IRS-1 as a potential molecular
target of ATRA in ovarian tumors was assessed by immunohistochemistry in an ovarian cancer tissue array. Compared
with normal ovary, the majority of malignant epithelial
ovarian tumors overexpressed IRS-1. Thus, there seems to be
a correlation between IRS-1 expression and malignancy in
ovarian tumors. Our results suggest that IRS-1 is in fact
an important growth-regulatory molecule that can be a potential effective target for chemotherapeutic intervention
with growth-suppressive agents, including retinoids. [Cancer

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal tumor of the female genital
tract accounting for f55% of gynecologic cancer deaths in the
United States (1). It is estimated that 200,000 cases of ovarian
cancer will be diagnosed worldwide per year with f115,000 deaths
(2). The high mortality rate is attributed to the fact that ovarian
cancer is generally detected at an advanced stage when the disease
is widespread. This is because early-stage ovarian cancer is often
asymptomatic. Therefore, despite aggressive debulking surgery
followed by chemotherapy, the overall prognosis for these patients
remains poor (3). Taking this into account, it is clear that an
effective alternative therapy for ovarian cancer is needed. There are

several ongoing clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute that use retinoids in cancer therapy.5
Retinoids, a group of natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin
A, have been shown to play an important role in regulating many
essential body functions, including cellular growth and differentiation. In addition, various retinoids are effective chemotherapeutic
and chemopreventive agents for several human cancers. Currently,
retinoids are used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic
leukemia and head and neck cancers (4, 5). Reports from several
laboratories including ours have shown that retinoids inhibit the
growth and cell cycle progression of ovarian carcinoma cell lines
(4). Our studies have focused on the effect of all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) treatment on two ovarian carcinoma cell lines, CA-OV3
and SK-OV3. Our results show that SK-OV3 cells are resistant to
the growth-inhibitory effects of ATRA, whereas CA-OV3 cells are
sensitive. ATRA has been shown to block CA-OV3 cell cycle
progression in the G1 phase (6–8). Additional studies have shown
that ATRA treatment leads to an increase in protein levels of
Rb2/p130, a member of the retinoblastoma family of proteins that
controls G1 checkpoint progression. We have also reported that
ATRA suppresses the growth-stimulatory activity of various
purified growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor
(IGF)-I (4, 9).
In the past few years, the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR), its ligands,
and components of the IGF-I signal transduction pathway have
emerged as distinct players in cancer biology. IGF-IR plays an
important role in mitogenesis, transformation, and protection from
apoptosis, leading to sustained cell proliferation of cancer cells
(10–12). IGF-IR has been implicated in the development of several
cancers, including ovarian cancer (13, 14). Increased levels of IGF-I
and IGF-IR have been found in various ovarian cancer cell lines and
in primary ovarian cancer tissues (14, 15).
The IGF-IR is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated
following ligand binding. The autophosphorylated receptor binds
to and phosphorylates tyrosine residues of several adaptor
molecules, such as the insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 to IRS6) and Src homology and collagen (Shc). IRS-1 is the prototype
member of the IRS family and, along with IRS-2, is widely expressed
in various tissues, including the ovary and mammary gland. IRS-1
has >20 tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its COOH terminus and
phosphorylated IRS-1 and Shc serve as docking molecules for
several Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. IRS-1 binds
to the p85 regulatory subunit and activates phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase, which in turn activates protein kinase B (Akt), a pathway
known to prevent apoptosis and mediate cellular proliferation.
Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc binds Grb2/Sos-activating Ras and

the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is
also active in mitogenesis. Although these two well-established
pathways have different downstream effectors, they are not
independent of each other. For example, IRS-1 can also bind
Grb2 and activate the MAPK pathway (16, 17).
There is increasing evidence in breast cancer models that IRS-1
is the main adaptor molecule activated by IGF-IR and plays a role
in cell proliferation. IRS-2 on the other hand is thought to regulate
cell motility and plays a role in metastasis (18, 19). Several studies
have shown that retinoids inhibit breast cancer cell growth through
interference in the IGF-IR signaling pathway. Inhibition of IGF-I–
stimulated growth, increased production of IGF-binding protein 3
and, recently, down-regulation of Akt pathway due to degradation
of IRS-1 (20, 21) are some of the mechanisms by which retinoids
inhibit growth of breast cancer cells.
We were therefore interested in investigating if retinoids could
suppress the growth of ovarian tumor cells by altering this
important growth-regulatory pathway. Our results show that
treatment with ATRA decreases IRS-1 protein in CA-OV3 cells
but not in SK-OV3 cells. We show that ATRA decreased the mRNA
and protein stability of IRS-1 and increased its ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation in CA-OV3 cells. Furthermore, modulation of IRS-1 levels in the two cell lines altered their response to
ATRA treatment. We also show by immunohistochemistry the upregulation of IRS-1 in ovarian malignancies of epithelial origin
compared with normal ovary in a tissue microarray of ovarian
cancer. Our results suggest that IRS-1 is in fact an important
growth-regulatory molecule in ovarian cancer cells and can serve
as a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention with
retinoids.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines CA-OV3
and SK-OV3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Cells were cultured as discussed previously (6–8).
Antibodies and reagents. The following primary antibodies were used
for Western blot analysis: anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-phosphorylated
Ser307 IRS-1 (where the immunizing sequence corresponds to the region
containing mouse Ser307/human Ser312 of IRS-1) antibodies obtained from
Upstate Biotechnology; anti-phosphorylated Tyr100 and anti-phosphorylated
Ser636/639 IRS-1 antibodies obtained from Cell Signaling Technology; antiShc antibody obtained from BD Biosciences; and anti-ubiquitin, anti-actin,
and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The secondary antibodies used
were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody
obtained from Amersham Biosciences and HRP anti-goat antibody obtained
from Pierce Biotechnology. The anti-IRS-1 antibody from Upstate
Biotechnology was used for the immunoprecipitation and anti-IRS-1
antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used for Western blotting
after immunoprecipitation. G418 from Alexis Biochemicals was dissolved in
water and used at a concentration of 800 Ag/mL. The proteasomal inhibitor
clasto-lactacystin h-lactone (CLBL) was purchased from Calbiochem,
dissolved in DMSO, and used at a concentration of 10 6 mol/L.
Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma Life Sciences, dissolved in
ethanol, and used at a concentration of 10 Ag/mL. ATRA was a generous gift
from Hoffman La Roche and used at a concentration of 10 6 mol/L in
ethanol to treat cells under subdued light on days 0, 3, and 6.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. After treatment with
ethanol or ATRA for 24, 48, and 72 h, whole-cell extracts were prepared and
processed for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation as described (22).
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. mRNA was obtained from ATRAtreated and control CA-OV3 cells at 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h using the RNAzol
B protocol (Tel-Test). Reverse transcriptions were done using the RT-for-

www.aacrjournals.org

PCR kit from Clontech. PCR was carried out as per the manufacturer’s
protocol with the exception of the use of [35S]dATP (1,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (6–8). Primers were as follows: IRS-1,
5¶-GTCCTAACCGCAACCAGAGTG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CCTTGACCAAATCCAGGTCTATG-3¶ (reverse); IRS-2, 5¶-ACCTGCGATGTTTACGTCCAA-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-AAAGGCGTTTGCAATGTGAAG-3¶ (reverse); and IGF-IR,
5¶-ACTTCTGCGCCAACATCCTCA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CCCTTTAGTCCCCGTCACTTCC-3¶ (reverse). GAPDH primers supplied with the cDNA
synthesis kit were used as loading control. The steady-state mRNA levels
of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IGF-IR were analyzed by phosphorimager and
quantitated using OptiQuant software. GAPDH mRNA levels were used
for normalization. The amount of mRNA at time 0 is set to 100%. The levels
of mRNA following ATRA treatment for the various time points are
expressed as % of control.
Stable transfection. Stable transfection of cells was done using the
calcium phosphate method. CA-OV3 cells were transfected with an IRS-1
full-length mouse cDNA and cloned in the sense orientation in pRC vector.
SK-OV3 cells were transfected with an IRS-1 mouse cDNA cloned in the
antisense orientation in pRC vector. The plasmid constructs were a kind gift
from Dr. Eva Surmacz (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). Cells were also
transfected with empty pCDNA3 vector to use as a control. All the plasmids
encode for G418 resistance and contain a constitutive cytomegalovirus
promoter. Medium containing fresh drug was added every 5 days. Isolated
colonies of resistant cells were selected f2 weeks after transfection.
Growth on monolayer. Growth of cells on monolayer was determined
by direct cell counting under the microscope using 0.4% trypan blue (Life
Technologies) at a ratio of 1:1.
Growth in soft agar. Anchorage-independent growth was determined
by using a growth in soft agar assay as described (6–8). After 15 days, each
plate was examined microscopically and z100 colonies were screened to
determine the number of colonies >50 Am in size.
Protein stability assay. Protein stability was determined at 0, 4, 8, 16, 24,
32, and 40 h after addition of cycloheximide as described previously (22).
Data are represented as % IRS-1 protein remaining in ethanol- and ATRAtreated plates with the 0-h cycloheximide time point set to 100%. The halflife (t 1/2) of IRS-1 protein was calculated using the regression program of
Microsoft Excel 2003.
Immunohistochemistry of ovarian cancer tissue arrays. An ovarian
cancer tissue array slide (Isu Abxis AccuMax array) and two breast cancer
tissue array slides used as positive and negative controls were used for
immunohistochemistry using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase methodology
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Vector Laboratories). In the
negative control, the primary antibody was omitted.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using the InStat
software package from GraphPad. Unpaired Student’s t test was used to
compare the growth of transfected clones to the wild-type cells. Paired
Student’s t test was used to compare the mRNA levels of IRS-1 following
ATRA treatment for the various time points. Differences having a P value of
<0.05, <0.01, <0.001, or <0.0001 are reported as statistically significant and
are designated with the symbols *, **, ***, and ****, respectively.

Results
ATRA treatment decreases IRS-1 levels in CA-OV3 ovarian
carcinoma cells. We first examined the protein levels of IRS-1,
IRS-2, and Shc, the key adaptor molecules in the IGF-I signaling
pathway following treatment with either ATRA or ethanol, which
was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of CA-OV3
cells with 10 6 mol/L ATRA for various lengths of time resulted in
a large decrease in IRS-1 protein levels by 72 h. However, no
differences in protein levels of IRS-2 or Shc were observed on ATRA
treatment. On the other hand, as seen in Fig. 1B, treatment of SKOV3 cells with ATRA did not result in a change in protein levels of
IRS-1, IRS-2, or Shc.
Modulation of IRS-1 expression affects the sensitivity of
ovarian carcinoma cells to ATRA treatment. Because we

observed a decrease in IRS-1 levels in CA-OV3 cells following ATRA
treatment, our next goal was to determine if modulating the levels
of IRS-1 would alter their sensitivity to ATRA. We hypothesized
that if down-regulation of IRS-1 was an essential factor in
mediating suppression of ovarian tumor cell growth by ATRA,
overexpression of IRS-1 in CA-OV3 cells would cause them to
become more resistant to growth inhibition by ATRA treatment. To
test this hypothesis, stably transfected CA-OV3 cells overexpressing
full-length mouse IRS-1 cDNA cloned in the sense orientation were
selected with G418. We chose several positive clones with different
levels of IRS-1 protein expression and examined their response to
ATRA treatment. Clone 18 had the highest amount of IRS-1
expression (Fig. 2A, top).
The graph in Fig. 2A compares the effect of ATRA treatment on
growth of sense IRS-1–overexpressing CA-OV3 (CAsIRS1) clones 18,
20, 24, and 29 with the wild-type CA-OV3 cells and an empty vector
clone. The results show that, although the wild-type and the empty
vector control CA-OV3 cells exhibited f35% inhibition in growth
following 5 days of ATRA treatment, the CAsIRS1 clones were
significantly resistant to ATRA being inhibited only approximately
10% to 20%. After 7 days of ATRA treatment, CAsIRS1 clones 18, 20,
and 24 continued to show significantly less (f20–35%) growth
inhibition compared with wild-type and empty vector control CAOV3 cells (f55–60%), whereas CAsIRS1 clone 29 exhibited f60%
growth inhibition, which is comparable with the wild-type and
empty vector control CA-OV3 cells. These results clearly indicate
that overexpression of IRS-1 induces the CA-OV3 cells to become
less sensitive to growth inhibition by ATRA following 5 days of
treatment. However, the resistance to growth inhibition is not
retained in some clones, such as clone 29, on longer treatment.
A likely explanation is that treatment for longer periods leads to a
decrease in both exogenous and endogenous IRS-1 in some
CAsIRS1 clones. It can be seen in Fig. 2B that this is the case for
clone 29.
We also used growth in soft agar as a second assay to determine
the effect of overexpression of IRS-1 on the growth of CAsIRS1
clones compared with the controls following ATRA treatment. As
shown previously in our laboratory, we observed a marked
decrease in the colony formation and the colony size of CA-OV3
cells following treatment with ATRA for 15 days (7). This decrease
in growth was dose dependent, with maximum inhibition at
10 6 mol/L ATRA treatment. On the other hand, CAsIRS1 clone 18
had larger and a higher number of colonies with ATRA treatment.
Whereas the colony formation at 10 6 mol/L ATRA treatment was
only moderately higher compared with the wild-type CA-OV3 cells,
at the lower concentrations of 10 7 and 10 8 mol/L ATRA, the
number of larger colonies was higher compared with the CA-OV3
cells (Fig. 2C). Figure 2D shows that the results of the growth in
soft agar assay for various CAsIRS1 clones and the controls were
comparable with our observation from the growth in monolayer
experiments. The soft agar assay clearly showed that the IRS-1–
overexpressing clones were more resistant to ATRA-mediated
growth inhibition. An interesting additional observation was that,
although there were differences between the clones in the number
of large colonies formed at 10 6 mol/L ATRA treatment, all of the
IRS-1–overexpressing clones formed colonies comparable in size at
10 7 and 10 8 mol/L ATRA concentrations. This showed that the
CAsIRS1 clones were all resistant to the growth-inhibitory effect of
ATRA at the lower concentrations (10 7 and 10 8 mol/L).
Because maintenance of IRS-1 levels in CA-OV3 cells resulted in
induction of resistance to ATRA growth suppression, we next

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

hypothesized that reduction of IRS-1 levels in ATRA-resistant
SK-OV3 cells might induce sensitivity to ATRA growth inhibition.
Thus, we next tested the effect of IRS-1 knockdown on the growth
of SK-OV3 cells following ATRA treatment. Stably transfected SKOV3 cells expressing full-length antisense mouse IRS-1 (SKasIRS1)
were selected with G418 and single-cell clones were screened for
the knockdown of IRS-1 expression. SKasIRS1 clones 14, 18, and 19
expressed reduced levels of IRS-1 protein (Fig. 2E, top). The graph
in Fig. 2E shows that, whereas the wild-type and empty vector
control SK-OV3 cells were completely resistant to ATRA treatment
at days 5 and 7, the antisense clones exhibited modest but
significant (f15–20%) growth inhibition following ATRA treatment for 7 days. These results clearly show that down-regulation of
IRS-1 is important for the ATRA-mediated growth inhibition of
ovarian carcinoma cells.
Decrease in IRS-1 protein following ATRA treatment is due
to reduction in IRS-1 mRNA levels and decreased protein
stability. Next, we wished to investigate the mechanism by which
ATRA treatment results in a decrease in IRS-1 protein levels. First,
we did [35S]dATP-labeled reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to

described in Materials and Methods. Actin or GAPDH was used as controls for

determine if the decrease in IRS-1 protein was due to a decrease in
the amount of IRS-1 mRNA. It is clear from gels in Fig. 3A that
there indeed is a time-dependent decrease in the mRNA levels of
IRS-1 with ATRA treatment of CA-OV3 cells. Interestingly, mRNA
levels of IRS-2 were also decreased following ATRA treatment. In
contrast, we observed no significant change in IGF-IR mRNA levels
with ATRA treatment. It is clear from the graph showing the
quantitation of the gels that IRS-1 mRNA levels decreased significantly by 48 h following ATRA treatment, whereas IRS-2 mRNA
levels decreased rapidly and remain at the reduced level throughout
the time following ATRA treatment. IGF-IR mRNA levels remain
constant throughout the 72 h of treatment with ATRA.
Next, we wished to determine if posttranscriptional/posttranslational mechanisms might also be responsible for the reduction in
IRS-1 levels following ATRA treatment. Previous work from our
laboratory has shown that ATRA acts via posttranslational
mechanisms to alter the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins,
such as Rb2/p130 and p27 (22, 23). Figure 3B shows that IRS-1
protein persists longer in ethanol-treated CA-OV3 cells compared

with ATRA-treated cells. The graph shows that the t 1/2 of IRS-1
decreases from >40 h to f24 h in ATRA-treated CA-OV3 cells. This
suggests that the decrease in IRS-1 protein following ATRA
treatment involves posttranslational mechanisms in addition to
transcriptional regulation and may result in a modification in its
degradation pathway. In contrast to the wild-type CA-OV3 cells,
IRS-1 protein in the CAsIRS1 clone 18 (Fig. 3C) remains the same in
both ethanol- and ATRA-treated samples.
ATRA increases the ubiquitination of IRS-1 in CA-OV3 cells.
To ascertain the posttranslational mechanism responsible for the
degradation of IRS-1 in CA-OV3 cells following ATRA treatment, we
examined the ubiquitin proteasome system. Figure 4A shows that
the decrease in IRS-1 protein observed following ATRA treatment
for 72 h is abrogated by treatment of cells with the proteasome
inhibitor CLBL. CLBL, a nonreversible inhibitor of the proteasome,
is the active metabolite of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin
(22). We next wanted to determine the extent of ubiquitination of
IRS-1 following ATRA treatment of CA-OV3 cells. Immunoprecipitation with IRS-1 and subsequent Western blot for ubiquitin were

ATRA treatment. CA-OV3 cells were treated with 10 6 mol/L ATRA or ethanol for 2 d followed by a 24-h treatment with CLBL. Cells were harvested and
immunoprecipitation (IP ) was done for IRS-1. Western blot (IB ) was then done with an anti-ubiquitin (Ub ) antibody. IRS-1 Western blot was done to verify the amount of
immunoprecipitated IRS-1 protein. C, CA-OV3 cells were treated with either ethanol or 10 6 mol/L ATRA for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Western blots were done on whole-cell
lysates using an antibody specific for phosphorylation at Ser312 (immunizing sequence corresponds to Ser307 in mice and Ser312 in humans) and Ser636/639 of
IRS-1. Total IRS-1 levels were also determined and GAPDH was used as the loading control. D, CA-OV3 cells were treated with ethanol or 10 6 mol/L ATRA for 72 h. Cells
were harvested and immunoprecipitation was done with an antibody against IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology). Western blot was then done using an anti-phosphotyrosine
(pY) antibody. The total IRS-1 levels were verified by Western blotting with anti-IRS-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after stripping the membrane.

done using CA-OV3 cells treated with ethanol and ATRA with or
without CLBL treatment. As shown in Fig. 4B, there is a clear
increase in the amount of ubiquitinated IRS-1 following ATRA
treatment in the samples treated with CLBL. This indicates that the
ubiquitin/proteasome system is responsible for degradation of
IRS-1 in CA-OV3 cells following ATRA treatment.
ATRA affects the phosphorylation status of IRS-1 in CA-OV3
cells. Serine phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in
down-regulation and degradation of IRS-1, whereas tyrosine
phosphorylation is required for mitogenesis and further downstream signaling. We looked at the phosphorylation of Ser312, Ser616,
and Ser636/639 of IRS-1, which are sites phosphorylated by c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and InB kinase (IKK), protein kinase C
(PKC), and mammalian target of rapamycin, respectively. We chose
these serine residues because it has been shown that the
phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser312, Ser616, and Ser636/639 negatively
regulates the functions of IRS-1 (24). As seen in Fig. 4C, we
observed that phosphorylation of Ser312 of IRS-1 was not decreased
in spite of decreased total IRS-1 following ATRA treatment,
indicating that it may play a role in the degradation of IRS-1.
The phosphorylation of Ser636/639 was unaffected at 48 h but was
slightly decreased at 72 h, and Ser616 showed very weak phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting that these sites probably
do not play a role in the degradation of IRS-1. Conversely, Fig. 4D
shows that total tyrosine phosphorylation detected in immunoprecipitated IRS-1 was indeed decreased at 72 h after ATRA
treatment.
IRS-1 is highly expressed in primary malignant ovarian
cancer tissues. Finally, to determine the significance of IRS-1 as a
potential molecular target for ATRA in primary ovarian cancer

cells, we analyzed levels of IRS-1 by immunohistochemistry in an
ovarian cancer tissue array. In normal ovary tissue sections
(Fig. 5A), we found that IRS-1 is expressed weakly in the stroma
ovarii, expressed moderately in primary oocytes, especially in
thecal cells, and highly expressed in the corpus luteum. On the
other hand, as seen in Fig. 5B and C, in the majority of malignant
epithelial ovarian tumors (serous, mucinous, clear cell, transitional,
endometrioid, and Brenner), IRS-1 immunolabeling was very strong
(Table 1). Interestingly, the IRS-1 expression is localized only to the
epithelial component, whereas the stroma remains negative. The
expression in germinal tumors was variable. IRS-1 was very weakly
expressed in all yolk sac tumors and granulosa cell tumors were also
weakly positive (except for one case, which was highly positive;
Fig. 5D). All dysgerminomas and fibromas were negative for IRS-1
expression. The other important finding was that all benign ovarian
tumors showed no expression of IRS-1, except for one case of serous
papillary cystadenoma, in which it is expressed in the epithelial cells
but not in the stroma. Table 1 lists the expression of IRS-1 in
the various ovarian cancer tissue samples and normal ovary. The
staging of the cancer tissue at the time of surgical removal from
the patients is also shown in the table. Although there does not
seem to be a correlation between the stage of cancer and expression
of IRS-1, it is evident that there is a strong correlation between IRS-1
expression and malignant epithelial tumors.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by
which ATRA blocks the IGF-IR signaling pathway, leading to
growth inhibition of CA-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Our results

show that (a) ATRA decreased the protein and mRNA levels of IRS1 in the ATRA-sensitive CA-OV3 cells, whereas IRS-1 protein levels
were not affected by ATRA in the resistant SK-OV3 cells; (b)
overexpression of IRS-1 in CA-OV3 cells rendered them resistant to
ATRA-mediated growth inhibition; (c) knockdown of IRS-1 levels in
SK-OV3 cells rendered them moderately sensitive to ATRA treatment; (d) ATRA decreased the stability of IRS-1 protein in CA-OV3
cells with a corresponding increase in ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation; (e) the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 was decreased, whereas the serine phosphorylation was maintained by ATRA treatment of CA-OV3 cells; and ( f ) IRS-1 is highly
expressed in malignant ovarian cancer tissues, especially the
epithelial tumors, suggesting a correlation between IRS-1 expression and malignancy.
We observed a decrease in IRS-1 protein and mRNA levels
following ATRA treatment of CA-OV3 cells. The activity of IRS-1
was also decreased as seen by its reduced tyrosine phosphorylation
on treatment with ATRA. Many studies have shown that IRS-1 by
itself is oncogenic and can induce malignant transformation (18).
In addition, certain oncogenes, such as SV40 T antigen, bind to
IRS-1 and require IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation for mitogenic and
transforming activity (25). IRS-1 is overexpressed in various
cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and

breast cancer. IRS-1 was constitutively active and phosphorylated
in a broad range of human tumors, including breast cancer,
leiomyoma, Wilms’ tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma,
leiomyosarcoma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma. Blocking the
constitutively activated IRS-1 with a dominant-negative IRS-1
dramatically reduced cancer cell growth in breast cancer and
hepatocellular carcinoma (26, 27). It has also been shown that
IRS-1 gene transcription can be enhanced by estrogen in breast
cancer cells and in the mouse mammary gland (28). Our study
shows similar results where IRS-1 expression is seen in the ethanoltreated control CA-OV3 and SK-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells.
However, the ATRA-sensitive CA-OV3 cells show reduced IRS-1
levels and activity on ATRA treatment, suggesting that it might play
a role in the growth inhibition of these cells. Our results, however,
vary slightly from a similar study looking at the ATRA-mediated
growth inhibition of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in that they
observed no changes in mRNA levels, although a reduction in total
phosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated protein levels was
seen (19). This suggests that, in spite of the same response
mediated by retinoid treatment, the mechanisms responsible for
this response may vary in different cell models.
The involvement of IRS-1 in the ATRA-mediated growth
inhibition of CA-OV3 cells is supported by our findings that

constitutive overexpression of IRS-1 in CA-OV3 cells renders them
somewhat resistant to ATRA treatment. The role of IRS-1 as a
growth-regulatory molecule is further reiterated by the growth
inhibition seen following ATRA treatment of SK-OV3 cells
expressing antisense IRS-1. Several studies using breast cancer

models have shown a role for IRS-1 in cell proliferation. It was
shown that overexpression of IRS-1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells resulted in autocrine growth that was partially estrogen independent (29). On the other hand, down-regulation of IRS-1 by small
interfering RNA (siRNA) in MCF-7 cells blocked IGF-I–mediated

and estrogen-mediated cell growth and resulted in cell death (30).
Recently, a study showed that lowering IRS-1 levels by siRNA not
only resulted in the down-regulation of Akt and induction of
apoptosis in MCF-7 cells but also enhanced tamoxifen-induced cell
death (31). Two recent studies further confirm the distinct roles
of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. The loss
of IRS-1 enhanced metastasis but not proliferation due to a
compensatory increase in IRS-2 levels (32). In T47D-YA breast
cancer cells that lack IRS expression, overexpression of IRS-1
resulted in increased proliferation, whereas overexpression of
IRS-2 resulted in increased motility (33). Our results also show that
IRS-1 plays a role in cell proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and
is similar to the results obtained by del Rincon et al. (20) showing
that IRS-1–overexpressing MCF-7 cells were resistant to the growthinhibitory effects of ATRA.
We have also shown that ATRA mediates the decrease in IRS-1
levels by reducing protein stability, which is the result of an increase
in the degradation of the protein by the ubiquitin proteasomal
pathway. This suggests that ATRA also alters IRS-1 levels in CA-OV3
cells by posttranscriptional/posttranslational mechanisms. Our
laboratory and others have shown that ATRA acts by either increasing or decreasing the proteasome-dependent degradation of
several cell cycle regulatory proteins, including Rb2/p130 (22),
cyclin D1 (34), p27 (35) cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (36), Skp2 (37),
and promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-a (38). Several
studies have shown that IRS-1 protein levels are regulated by IGF-I
and insulin via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway (39–41).
Our results are consistent with previous studies reported by del
Rincon et al. (21) showing that ATRA degrades IRS-1 in MCF-7
breast cancer cells via the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway.
As mentioned earlier, IRS-1 can be activated by tyrosine kinase–
mediated phosphorylation of numerous tyrosine residues. However,
the ability of IRS-1 to instigate downstream signaling and subsequent cellular functions is under negative feedback control by
several mechanisms. Importantly, IRS-1 contains >30 serine phosphorylation sites that are direct targets of serine/threonine kinases
that inhibit IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Serine phosphorylation
of IRS-1 can interfere with its function by targeting it for inactivation and/or proteasomal degradation (24). Our results indicate
that ATRA may affect serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 as seen by
the maintenance of phosphorylated Ser312 IRS-1 levels in spite of
decreased total IRS-1 levels. Studies have shown that phosphorylation of Ser312 disrupts IRS-1 function by inhibiting interactions
between the IRS-1 phosphotyrosine-binding domain and upstream
receptors such as IGF-IR (42). Consequently, IRS-1 is not
phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, hence blocking downstream
signaling complexes. This in essence shuts off IRS-1–mediated
signaling. The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a has
been shown to inactivate IRS-1 through a JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser312, leading to insulin resistance (43). Greene et al.

(44) identified 18 PKCy serine/threonine phosphorylation sites on
IRS-1 and showed that, when Ser312 along with Ser323 and Ser574
were mutated to alanines, the phosphorylation of IRS-1 by activated PKCy was significantly decreased. The phosphorylation of
Ser312 in CA-OV3 cells observed following ATRA treatment in our
study could be through activation of kinases such as JNK, IKK,
or PKCy. Thus, decoding the mechanisms of negative feedback
regulation via IRS-1 serine phosphorylation mediated by ATRA
could prove to be a critical step to fully understanding the role of
IRS-1 in ovarian cancer.
Finally, our immunohistochemical studies of an ovarian cancer
tissue array containing different phenotypes of ovarian tumors
revealed that IRS-1 is highly expressed in malignant epithelial
ovarian tumors. This is consistent with our studies in CA-OV3 and
SK-OV3 cells, which are cell lines derived from serous adenocarcinomas and are epithelial in nature. Although there is a clear
distinction in expression of IRS-1 between normal and benign
tumors versus malignant tumors, there does not seem to be a correlation between the stage of the cancer and expression of IRS-1.
This is not surprising as immunohistochemical studies done using
other cell models show similar discrepancies. Koda et al. (45)
recently showed that IRS-1 is expressed in primary breast cancer
and metastases and that levels of IRS-1 correlated with poor
differentiation (grade 3) and positive lymph node status. Interestingly, in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors, IRS-1 levels
correlated positively with proliferation as determined by Ki67
staining, but in ER-negative breast tumors, IRS-1 correlated
negatively with proliferation. Another recent study in human
breast cancer showed that nuclear IRS-1 levels were low in normal
mammary epithelial cells and higher in grade 2 ductal carcinoma
and lobular carcinoma and were associated with more differentiated cancer (46). Yet, another study has shown that IRS-1 levels are
decreased in differentiated breast tumors (47). In contrast, IRS-1
expression is decreased in 44% of non–small cell lung tumors, and
the loss of IRS-1 expression was more in larger tumors (48).
A potential explanation for the apparent discrepancy among these
IRS-1 expression studies may be that the overall expression of IRS-1
may not actually reflect its functional status.
In conclusion, our study has shown that IRS-1 is an important
growth-regulatory molecule in the ATRA-mediated growth inhibition of ovarian carcinoma cells and hence could be a potential
chemotherapeutic target.
