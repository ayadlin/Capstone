ABSTRACT
Objectives: To determine the safety of Puquitinib Mesylate (XC-302), an oral
inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in treating relapsed or refractory nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
Methods: Between October 2013 and July 2015, 21 patients from Sun Yat-sen
University Cancer Center were treated twice daily on each day of a 28-day cycle
(median number of cycles, 2; maximum, 20) with XC-302 at a post prandial dose of
25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg. Adverse events (AEs), AUClast and Cmax, response rates, and
overall survival were assessed.
Results: Patients had received a median (range) of 1 (1 to 3) previous cancer
treatments. At the latest follow-up, two patients were still benefitting from the study.
The most common drug-related AEs were elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT,
14 of 21 patients) and aspartate transaminase (AST, 7 of 21 patients). Four patients,
both in the-50-mg group, had dose-limiting toxicities, and therapy was discontinued
in a fifth because of persistent abnormal liver function. The overall response rate
was 2 of19. Serum concentrations of XC-302 increased in a dose-dependent pattern.
Median progression-free survival in all patients was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0) months.
Conclusion: XC-302 has an acceptable safety profile and offers potential
therapeutic value to patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Puquitinib Mesylate (XC-302), developed
independently by Xinchang Pharmacy Corporation
(Zhejiang Medicine Co. , Ltd. China), is a new multipletarget-point inhibitor. Preliminary studies have discovered
that XC-302 inhibits the proliferation of several cancer
cell lines, such as colon, lung, breast, ovarian, prostate
cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, osteosarcoma, in which
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranged
between 0.5 and 2.0 μM.

INTRODUCTION
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
pathway is an essential component of malignant cellular
processes [1–3] that is critical to the development and
progression malignant tumors [4]. The inhibitors targeting
PI3K-pathway proteins have been investigated as new
anti-cancer drugs [5–7], and several are currently in early
phase clinical trials [6, 8].

Safety and toxicity

Cell lines with drug resistance mediated by p170/
MDR-1 / p-Glycoprotein are similarly sensitive to
XC-302. It also exhibited obvious anti-tumor efficacy
in xenografts to nude mice with cancer of the colon,
stomach, or lung. XC-302 immediately suppresses
the activity of PI3K (in subtype IA, IC50 against PI3K
isoforms was p110α = 766.6 nM, p110β = 699.4  nM,
p110δ = 2.8nM, and p110γ = 89.7 nM). It also apparently
inhibits AKT phosphorylation mediated by EGFR
(IC50 = 0.1 μM), the activity of receptor tyrosine
kinase (KDR and PDGFR β; IC50 = 1.0 μM), and the
formation of the vascular endothelial cells lumen
(IC50 = 0.1 μM). In addition, it is rapidly absorbed and
has a high absolute bioavailability, as indicated by the
pre-clinical pharmacokinetics tests. Finally, XC-302
shows low toxicity by toxicology experiments (Data
were quoted from the unpublished information, personal
communication with Wei Mao on January 1, 2013).
In a first-in-man Phase I study in Chinese patients
with advanced solid tumors, the dosing was set on the
basis of efficacy in animal models and toxicity studies.
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent
XC-302 was 75 mg when given on a continuous daily
schedule postprandial and 50 mg when given twice
daily (BID) postprandial. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)
included reversible increased ALT/AST concentrations
and vomiting. XC-302 exhibited anti-cancer activity in
advanced solid tumors (disease control rate = 52.5%).
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) monitoring revealed
good oral bioavailability (Data were quoted from the
unpublished information, personal communication with
Wei Mao on January 1, 2013).
On the basis of these data, we conducted a phase 1,
dose-escalation study of XC-302 in patients with relapsed
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Our objectives were to
determine the safety, pharmacokinetics characteristics, and
efficacy of the drug.

All patients experienced at least one drug-related
AE during the trial (Table 2). Most adverse events were
grade 1 or 2 and resolved with appropriate management.
The most common AEs were elevated alanine transaminase
(ALT, 66.7%) and aspartate transaminase (AST, 33.3%)
concentrations, anemia (33.3%), neutropenia (23.8%),
leukopenia (19.9%) and thrombocytopenia (19.0%).
However, the marrow suppression was considered
not correlated with XC-302 after the judgment. Other
familiar AEs included upper respiratory infection (URI,
19.0%), gastrointestinal adverse reactions, fecal occult
blood (19.0%), hematuresis (14.3%), creatinine elevation
(9.5%), myocardial ischemia (9.5%), peripheral nerve
toxicity, rash (9.5%) and so on which were responded
well to symptomatic treatment and were generally well
tolerated.
Four patients (No. 9, 14, 15, 21), all receiving
50 mg, had a grade 3 transaminases elevation, which
was considered to be related to XC-302, and one of these
(No. 15) was withdrawn when the elevation continued
(Table 2). These AEs met the definition of a DLT.
Therefore 50mg twice a day was the determined MTD for
this schedule. No DLT events were observed at the 25-mg
or 37.5-mg doses.

Pharmacokinetics of XC-302
Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed on
all patients. Trough values for XC-302 were similar on
days 1 and 28, demonstrating that a steady state was
achieved. Pharmacokinetic response was linear, with
general exposure to XC-302 (AUClast and Cmax) increasing
with increasing dose. Similar pharmacokinetic values
were observed on day 28 (Figure 1). XC-302 serum
concentrations peaked about 4 hours after administration
and decreased slowly (Figure 1). Serum XC-302
concentrations generally increased in a dose-dependent
manner over the investigated range (doses ranged from
25 mg to 50 mg).

RESULTS
The first patient was enrolled in October 2013,
and the last follow-up visit was completed in July 2015.
Follow-up ranged from 0.2 to 19.3 months, with a median
of 1.7 months (SD = 4.4); two patients (9.5%) were lost to
follow-up. Median (range) age of the 21 patients (17 men)
was 56 years (39 to 72 years). All patients had Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance scores of 1. All
had received standard treatment(s) before the study with
little effect.
Of the 21, 3 received 25 mg doses of XC-302,
9 received 37.5 mg, and 9 received 50 mg. The median
number of cycles received was 2 (range 1 to 20). The
most common primary tumors were small lymphocytic
lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/
CLL), which were found in 10 patients and mantle cell
lymphoma, which was found in 5 (Table 1).

Antitumor activity
At least one response assessment was available for
19 patients (Table 3). Two patients were loss to followup and withdrawn from the study. At the first efficacy
evaluation, 6 patients had stable disease and 11 had
progressive disease. The overall response rate was zero
in patients taking the 25-mg or 37.5-mg doses (Table 3).
Only 2 of 19 achieved an objective response, one partial
response and one minor response. Time to response
for these two patients was 1.8 and 1.84 months. For all
19 patients, median (range) duration of response was 7.1
(6.9 to 7.3) months, and the median (range) progression
free survival (PFS) was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0) months

(Figure 2). The range of progression-free survival was 1.5
to 1.9 months for the 12 patients taking the 25-mg and
37.5-mg doses and 0.9 to 9.1 months for the 7 patients
taking the 50-mg dose.
At the latest follow-up, two patients were still on
treatment. One, with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue in the 50-mg group, achieved a partial response, and
the other, with mantle cell lymphoma in 25 mg group, had
stable disease. Among SLL/CLL patients receiving a dose
of 50 mg, one had a partial response after the 4th treatment
cycle but progressive disease after the 12th cycle.

included adverse gastrointestinal reactions, hematuresis
and rash, which have been reported in other study of
PI3K inhibitors [9–11]. However, in the 13 patients
(61.9%) with stage IV disease with lymphoma bone
marrow involvement and hemopoietic malfunction,
myelosuppression was judged not to be related to XC-302
therapy. In addition, many other AEs (eg, infection,
nausea, constipation) were expected because intercurrent
illness in an older population of patients, and side effects
of previous therapy.
PI3K signaling disrupts insulin signaling, and
hyperglycemia has been considered a toxicity of PI3K
inhibition [8, 12]. However, we observed no XC302related hyperglycemia. One possible explanation is that
serum glucose concentrations are characteristically
elevated in patients receiving pan-PI3K inhibitors that
have activity against PI3Kα [8, 13], whereas XC-302
showed a selectivity for PI3Kδ. PI3Kδ is an important

DISCUSSION
In this phase 1 study, XC-302 was well tolerated, and
most treatment-emergent AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity,
suggesting that XC-302 will be compatible in combination
with cytotoxic agents or other targeted agents. The most
common AEs were abnormal liver function (increased

messenger in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, and PI3Kδ
signaling pathways are commonly overactive in B-cell
tumors [14, 15]and increase proliferation, development
and survival of tumor cells [16, 17]. Another possible
explanation is that hyperglycemia was transient and did
not markedly disturb glucose homoeostasis. The few
patients with rashes did not require permanent drug
discontinuation.

or greater serum transaminase elevations in 25% (n = 64)
indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) [21] and in 35%
(n = 40) MCL [22] patients. Grade 3 AST abnormalities
were observed in 2 of 84 patients with advanced solid
tumors in a Phase I study of the PI3K inhibitor PX866
[9]. In another Phase I study of BGT226, in patients with
advanced solid tumors and lymphoma, AST elevations
were the most common biochemical abnormality (Grade 2,
n = 9; Grade 3, n = 3) [18]. In clinical trials of BKM120,
liver enzyme concentrations (including ALT/AST,
transaminase, and hyperbilirubinemia levels) have been
elevated with varying frequencies [20, 23].
The small sample size and the heterogeneity of
the patients preclude any conclusions about the clinical
activity of XC-302. The overall objective response
we observed was lower than that of other PI3K p110δ
inhibitors, such as Idelalisib [21, 22], perhaps because
of insufficient cases, different types of disease, or the
effectiveness of XC-302 itself. However, one of the nine
patients with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
in 50-mg group achieved a PR in the first cycle. In the
phase I study of Idelalisib in indolent non-Hodgkin
lymphoma [21], the response rate in marginal-zone
lymphoma subtype was 33%. The data in our research
indicates that XC-302 might have the potential to be
a promising therapy in patients with gastric MALT
lymphoma.

Patient population
Patients were eligible for the study if they were
at least 18 years old and had a histologically confirmed
diagnosis of lymphoma, including histologic subtypes of
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), treated at Sun Yat-sen
University Cancer Center between October 2013 and July
2015. Patients had to be refractory to treatment or to have
relapsed after standard therapy and had to have at least one
lesion measuring 1.5 cm in a single dimension as measured
on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scan. Patients had to have an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score
no greater than 2 and be able to swallow tablets. All patients
had to have adequate renal, liver function and appropriate
hematologic values (WBC >1 × 109/L, PLT > 50 × 109/L)
with a life expectancy of at least 3 months.
Patients were ineligible if they had symptomatic central
nervous system metastasis or had received chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, targeted therapy products (in the previous
4 weeks), PI3K inhibitors, strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, or
strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A (a preliminary study
showed that XC-302 irreversibly inhibited the activity of
CYP1A2 enzyme). Patients testing positive for hepatitis B,
hepatitis C (antibody), or human immunodeficiency virus
(antigen or antibody), and those with serious other diseases,
previous cancers, and gastrointestinal disease affecting oral
absorption of drug were excluded. Pregnant or nursing
women were also excluded.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
We conducted this study in accordance with the
guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and
after approved by the independent ethics committee of
the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. The study
was registered with China Food and Drug administration
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Study design and drug administration
This phase I study was designed as a single-arm,
open-label dose-escalation study of XC-302. The MTD
44054

of XC-302 given daily as a single-agent after meals was
75 mg. A DLT greater than Grade 2 was not observed
in patients treated with twice-daily dosing at 25 mg,
37.5 mg after the meal (28-day cycles). The data of PK
and pharmacodynamics (PD) preclinical showed that
dosing at 25 mg, 37.5 mg postprandial could suppress
the concentration of lymphoma cell effectively (Data
were quoted from the unpublished information, personal
communication with Wei Mao on January 1, 2013).
At least three patients were enrolled in each dosage
group. Starting at 25 mg, the dose was increased to 37.5
mg and then to 50 mg. XC-302 was administered orally
BID on days 1–28 of a 28-day cycle until unacceptable
toxicity or disease progression was observed. Escalation
to the next highest dose was based on DLT observed at the
previous dose.

Safety was assessed in all patients who received any
amount of XC-302, and overall response rate, PFS were
calculated in patients with at least one efficacy evaluation.
Only responding patients were assessed for TTR and
DOR. In calculating time-to-event variables, log-rank test
and Kaplan-Meier methods were used.

CONCLUSION
Our data support the conclusions that XC-302 in
a 28-day cycle showed a tolerable safety profile. The
MTD was determined to be 50 mg twice daily. Although
the response rate of the drug is not as high as that of the
PI3Ks inhibitors, XC-302 might be a promising therapy in
patients with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
lymphoma.

Research objectives

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND FUNDING

This was a phase I open label, dose-escalation study
whose primary objective was to characterize the safety of
XC-302 in adult Chinese patients with advanced lymphoma
administered on a 28-day cycle. Others were to determine
the pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics and anti-tumor
activity. The anti-tumor effects of XC-302 were evaluated
every 2 cycles with the Standardized Response Criteria of
the National Cancer Institute International Working Group
(IWG) [24]. Efficacy evaluation for CLL was on account
of IWCLL criteria [25] while for NHL, it was analyzed by
IWG response criteria [26]. Patients with stable disease or
partial remission were allowed to continue therapy until
progressive disease or toxicity was observed.

Data collection and assessments
Routine clinical and laboratory baseline
assessments included obtaining correlative history and
details of previous cancer treatment. Safety assessments
included physical examination, hematology, and clinical
chemistry testing (including fasting glucose and HbA
concentrations), electrocardiogram and so on, during
subsequent cycles. All Adverse events (AE) were graded
using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) version 3.0.
Detailed pharmacokinetic were analyzed by
taking blood samples before (within 1 hour) and after
(every 2 hours) dosing on days 1, 28 of cycle 1. Plasma
concentrations of XC-302 were measured with a validated
liquid chromatography assay. Pharmacokinetic measures,
such as the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and
area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), were
estimated in every patient.
