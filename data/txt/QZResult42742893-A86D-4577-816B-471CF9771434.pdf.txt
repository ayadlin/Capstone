ABSTRACT
Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factor (TF) Sp1 is overexpressed in multiple
tumors and is a negative prognostic factor for patient survival. Sp1 and also Sp3 and
Sp4 are highly expressed in cancer cells and in this study, we have used results of RNA
interference (RNAi) to show that the three TFs individually play a role in the growth,
survival and migration/invasion of breast, kidney, pancreatic, lung and colon cancer
cell lines. Moreover, tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing L3.6pL pancreatic
cancer cells as xenografts were significantly decreased in cells depleted for Sp1, Sp3
and Sp4 (combined) or Sp1 alone. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of changes in gene
expression in Panc1 pancreatic cancer cells after individual knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and
Sp4 demonstrates that these TFs regulate genes and pathways that correlated with the
functional responses observed after knockdown but also some genes and pathways
that inversely correlated with the functional responses. However, causal IPA analysis
which integrates all pathway-dependent changes in all genes strongly predicted that
Sp1-, Sp3- and Sp4-regulated genes were associated with the pro-oncogenic activity.
These functional and genomic results coupled with overexpression of Sp transcription
factors in tumor vs. non-tumor tissues and decreased Sp1 expression with age indicate
that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are non-oncogene addiction (NOA) genes and are attractive drug
targets for individual and combined cancer chemotherapies.

these transcription factors also exhibit unique properties
including the number of isoforms and DNA binding
characteristics [15–17]. Moreover, since Sp1 regulates
expression of both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressorlike genes, it has been suggested that “a more complete
understanding of the function of Sp1 in cancer is required
to validate its potential as a therapeutic target” [17].
Most studies in cancer cells have focused on Sp1 [17]
and there is evidence showing that knockdown of Sp1 by
RNA interference (RNAi) in cancer cell lines inhibits cell
growth, survival and migration/invasion [18–21]. Although
there are a few reports indicating that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4
differentially regulate some genes and coregulate others [1820, 22-24], the functional roles of Sp3 and Sp4 compared to
Sp1 in cancer cells have not been extensively investigated.
In this study, we show that individual knockdown of Sp1,
Sp3 and Sp4 by RNAi in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231
breast, A549 lung, SW480 colon, 786-O kidney, and Panc1,
L3.6pL and MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cell lines results in

INTRODUCTION
Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors (TFs)
Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are members of the Sp/Krüppel-like
family (KLF), and results from Sp knockout mouse
models demonstrate the importance of Sp genes to
embryonic growth and early development [reviewed in
1]. However, expression of Sp1 in humans and rodents
decreases with age [2–4]. Moreover, several studies report
that high expression of Sp1 and, in some cases, Sp3 in
tumor vs. non-tumor tissue are negative prognostic factors
for patients with pancreatic, glioma, colon, gastric, head
and neck, prostate, lung and breast cancers [5–13]. Studies
in cancer cell lines show that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are highly
expressed, and RNA interference (RNAi) studies indicate
that Sp transcription factors regulate genes associated
with cell proliferation, survival and migration/invasion
[reviewed in 14]. Although Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 have similar
modular structures and bind GC-rich promoter sequences,

inhibition of cell growth, decreased survival, and inhibition
of migration/invasion. Thus, all three Sp transcription
factors exhibit pro-oncogenic activity. Using Panc1 cells
as a model, a causal Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
of changes in gene expression after knockdown of Sp1,
Sp3 and Sp4 strongly correlated with observed changes
in functional responses for the three Sp proteins. Thus,
the oncogenic-like activity of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 and Spregulated genes coupled with their overexpression in tumor
vs. non-tumor tissue suggests that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are
non-oncogene addiction (NOA) genes that are “attractive
drug targets” [25].

in RD rhabdomyosarcoma and KU7 bladder cancer cells
[20, 24], whereas in other cell lines, knockdown of an
individual Sp protein also decreased expression of one
or both of the other gene products [18–24]. For example,
knockdown of Sp1 (siSp1) or Sp3 (siSp3) in 253JB-V
bladder cancer cells decreased expression of Sp4 protein,
whereas siSp4 did not affect levels of Sp3 or Sp1 proteins
[24]. Western blot analysis of expression of Sp TFs
after transfection of the cancer cell lines with siControl
(siCtl, non-specific oligonucleotide) or oligonucleotides
targeting Sp1 (siSp1), Sp3 (siSp3), Sp4 (siSp4), or their
combination (siSp1,3,4) showed that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4
proteins were highly expressed in the eight cancer cell
lines and this includes both the high and low molecular
weight bands for Sp3 [15, 29] (Figure 2). Knockdown
of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 was relatively specific for the
individual Sp proteins only in Panc1 cells. In contrast,
siSp3 decreased expression of Sp1 (SKBR3, SW480 and
A549) and Sp4 (L3.6pL and MiaPaCa2) proteins; siSp4
decreased Sp1 (SKBR3, SW480, 786-O and L3.6pL) and
Sp3 (SKBR3 , MiaPaCa2 and MDA-MB-231) proteins;
and siSp1 decreased Sp3 (786-O) and Sp4 (MiaPaCa2)
proteins. These results are quantitated in Supplementary
Figure S2 and demonstrate that autoregulation of
Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 was observed in seven of the eight
cancer cell lines and primarily involved Sp3 and Sp4
and their regulation of each other or of Sp1. Sp TFs
regulate expression of several pro-oncogenic factors
including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), survivin and
bcl2 [14]. In this study, we examined the effects of Sp
knockdown on expression of these genes and induction
of the apoptotic marker cleaved PARP in the cancer cell
lines. Transfection of siSp1, siSp3, siSp4 and siSp1,3,4
induced PARP cleavage in all eight cell lines (Figure 3)
and this complemented the increased Annexin V staining
(Figure 1B) observed after the same treatments. EGFR,
VEGF, bcl-2 and survivin were expressed in the eight
cancer cell lines, and siSp1,3,4 downregulated these
gene products; however, the effects of siSp1, siSp3 and
siSp4 were variable and there were also gene- and cell
context-specific differences. For example, expression of
EGFR was decreased in the eight cancer cell lines after
transfection of siSp1, siSp3 and siSp4 and expression of
all of gene products (EGFR, survivin, bcl-2 and VEGF)
were decreased in cells transfected with siSp3 and
siSp4 but variable responses were observed for siSp1
(Figures 3A–3D). Western blot analysis of tumor lysates
(derived from L3.6pL cells as xenografts) also showed
that the loss of Sp TFs resulted in decreased expression
of Sp-regulated gene products, survivin, bcl-2 and
EGFR and also decreased expression of Sp TFs (Figure
3E). The knockdown of Sp TFs persisted throughout
the experiment except for the increased expression
of the lower molecular weight Sp3 band in tumors
from 2/4 mice in which L3.6pL cells were transfected

RESULTS
Knockdown of Sp transcription factors in cancer
cell lines: functional effects
The functional and genomic effects of Sp1, Sp3 and
Sp4 were investigated by RNAi in several different cancer
cell lines. Multiple oligonucleotides for Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4
have previously been used for studying Sp-regulated gene
expression and functional responses (Supplementary Figure
S1) [18–21], and a single representative oligonucleotide
was used for this study. Figure 1 summarizes the effects
of knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in A549, MiaPaCa2,
L3.6pL, Panc1, SW480, 786-O, SKBR3 and MDAMBA-231 cancer cell lines. Decreased individual expression
of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in eight different cancer cell lines
resulted in significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation
(Figure 1A), induction of Annexin V (a marker of apoptosis)
(Figure 1B), and inhibition of cancer cell migration in a
Boyden Chamber assay (Figure 1C) and knockdown of all
three genes (siSp1, 3, 4) enhanced the observed responses.
The magnitude of the effects showed some variability and
was dependent on the individual Sp protein and cell context.
Most previous functional studies have focused on Sp1;
however, results illustrated in Figure 1 clearly demonstrate
that both Sp3 and Sp4 also significantly contribute to the
growth, survival and migration/invasion of the eight cancer
cells lines and comparable effects were observed after
individual knockdown of these transcription factors. In a
parallel experiment, combined knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and
Sp4 or individual knockdown of Sp1 in L3.6pL cells used in
an athymic nude mouse xenograft model showed that loss of
Sp TFs resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth
and tumor weights (Figure 1D and 1E).

Knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in cancer cell lines:
effects on Sp TFs and Sp-regulated gene products
The individual effects of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4
knockdown could be indirect since the three genes
contain GC-rich promoters and they could be selfregulatory [26–28]. Previous studies demonstrated high
specificity for knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 by RNAi

effective silencing of Sp transcription factors by RNAi
using oligonucleotides over the relatively short (14 day)
duration of the xenograft study due to the rapid growth of
L3.6pL-derived tumors [30, 31]. Thus, the in vivo results
complemented in vitro studies and confirmed the prooncogenic functions of Sp TFs.

Results of RNAi studies show that Sp1, Sp3 and

model. Transfection of Panc1 cells with siSp1, siSp3 and
siSp4 and analysis of gene expression using arrays resulted
in inhibition or induction of 3,532, 4,826 and 4,293 genes,
respectively (Figure 4A). After knockdown of Sp1, Sp3
and Sp4, Venn diagrams show considerable overlap of
genes commonly regulated by Sp1:Sp3 (1,113); Sp1:Sp4
(1,114) and Sp3:Sp4 (2,753) with the most pronounced
gene overlap observed for Sp3 and Sp4 (Figure 4B).
IPA was used to investigate common and differentially
expressed genes after knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4
associated with cell proliferation, survival and migration/
invasion and there were significant changes in total gene
expression associated with cell proliferation (788, 1,204
and 1,044 genes, respectively), survival (759, 975 and 995
genes, respectively) and migration/invasion (150, 190 and
197 genes, respectively) (Figure 4C–4E). Venn diagrams
also showed that there was a considerable overlap of
common genes coregulated by Sp1:Sp3, Sp1:Sp4 and
Sp3:Sp4 associated with cell proliferation (Figure 4C),
survival (Figure 4D) and migration/invasion (Figure 4E).
For example, after knockdown of Sp3 and Sp4 by RNAi,
there was a 60-70% overlap of genes associated with
Panc1 cell proliferation, survival and migration/invasion
and this correlated with their common regulation of total
genes (Figure 4B). Examination of the changes in gene
expression after RNAi showed that there were Sp1-, Sp3and Sp4-regulated genes that both correlated or inversely
correlated with the observed functional responses induced
by knockdown of Sp TFs (Figure 1). This was confirmed
by real time PCR analysis (Figure 5) showing that one or
more Sp TFs decreased expression of the tumor promoting
genes ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) and Aurora
kinase A (AURKA) (Figure 5A) and increases expression
of the tumor suppressor-like genes such as thioredoxininteracting protein (TXNIP) and the polycomb CBX7
genes (Figure 5B) [32–35]. However, knockdown of one
or more Sp TFs also decreased expression of caspase 3
(CASP3) and Sprouty2 (SPRY2) that inhibit pancreatic
tumorigenesis (Figure 5C) and increased expression of
genes such as heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and interferonstimulated gene 15 (ISG15) that promote carcinogenesis
(Figure 5D) [36–39]. These results are consistent with the
IPA of array data showing that Sp TFs regulate genes that
both correlate and inversely correlate with the results of
functional studies (Supplementary Tables S1–S3).
Many transcription factors also regulate genes
that correlate or inversely correlate with their functional
responses and therefore we used causal IPA which is a
quantitative approach that integrates all of the changes
in expression of genes and pathways in large data sets
to predict biologic function [40]. Table 1 summarizes
the analysis of the total changes in gene expression
after knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in Panc1 cells.
The low p-values and activation score values (>2 or
<-2, respectively) obtained from this analysis strongly
predicted that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 were associated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Panc1 cell proliferation, survival and migration/invasion
and were consistent with the functional results illustrated
in Figure 1. These functional and quantitative genomic
data coupled with the high expression of Sp transcription
factors in tumor vs. non-tumor tissue suggests that Sp1,
Sp3 and Sp4 are NOA genes and attractive drug targets.

DISCUSSION
The concept of NOA highlights the fact that the
cancer genotype and hallmarks of cancer are maintained
by both oncogenes and NOA genes which are also
important targets for mechanism-based anticancer agonists
[25, 41]. Among Sp/KLF transcription factors, Sp1 has
been most extensively investigated and fulfills many of
the criteria for an NOA gene. Sp1 levels decrease with
age in rodents and humans [2–4] and several studies
show that Sp1 levels are high in tumor vs. non-tumor
tissue [5–13]. The differential expression of Sp1 has also
been observed in human fibroblasts where carcinogenor oncogene-induced transformation resulted in an
8- to 18-fold increase in Sp1 levels [42]. Moreover, in
xenograft experiments, the loss of Sp1 in fibrosarcoma
cells decreased their ability to form tumors [42] and the
role of Sp1 in tumor growth, survival and migration/
invasion has been confirmed in other reports [14, 18–21].
Our results clearly demonstrate for the first time that
not only Sp1 but also Sp3 and Sp4 play a role in cancer
cell growth, survival and migration/invasion of multiple
cancer cell lines (Figure 1) and regulate expression of gene
products (Figure 3) consistent with these observations.
We also observed that tumor growth in mice bearing
L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cells depleted of Sp1 or Sp1,
Sp3 and Sp4 (combined) was significantly lower than
observed in studies using wild-type cells expressing these
TFs (Figure 3E). Moreover, transfection of Panc1 cells
with siSp1, siSp3 or siSp4 and IPA of changes in gene
expression by arrays showed that all three transcription
factors regulated genes that enhance cell proliferation,
survival and migration/invasion (Supplementary Tables
S1-S3). Despite overlap in their regulation of common
genes (Figure 4), RNAi studies on functional effects of
Sp TFs (Figure 1) showed that individual loss of Sp1, Sp3
or Sp4 was sufficient to decrease growth, survival and
invasion and compensation by the other two Sp genes was
not observed, suggesting unique gene regulatory functions
for each of these transcription factors and this is currently
being investigated.
Sp1 regulates expression of genes that both enhance
and inhibit carcinogenesis as indicated in the analysis
of our array data (Supplementary Tables S1–S3) and
results, illustrated in Figure 5 and this has been raised as a
possible cautionary consideration for clinical development
of anticancer drugs that specifically target Sp proteins
[17]. However, causal IPA approaches which weigh
contributions of individual genes to various networks/

pathways (Table 1) showed that after knockdown of Sp1,
Sp3 or Sp4, changes in expression of all genes/pathways
associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival and
migration/invasion strongly correlated with the observed
functional responses (Figure 1).
Previous studies have reported differences in the
prognostic value of Sp1 overexpression in breast and lung
cancer patients and also differences in the pro- and anticarcinogenic role of Sp1 in MDA-MB-231 breast and A549
lung cancer cell lines [10, 43–47]. Using an RNAi approach
(Figure 1), our results show that not only Sp1 but also Sp3
and Sp4 exhibit pro-oncogenic activities in MDA-MB-231
and A549 cells. Some of the differences between studies
may be due to the methods used to modulate Sp expression
since overexpression of Sp1 and Sp3 in some cancer cell
lines induces apoptosis and inhibits growth [48–51]. It is

possible that overexpressing Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 may not
always be ideal for probing the “constitutive” functions of
these transcription factors since high intracellular levels
of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 resulting from overexpression may
activate genes with GC-rich promoters that are not normally
expressed, and this is currently being investigated.
In summary, this study indicates that Sp1, Sp3 and
Sp4 are NOA genes that are highly expressed in tumor vs.
non-tumor tissue and regulate expression of pro-oncogenic
factors that contribute to cancer cell growth, survival
and migration/invasion. Although many transcription
factors are difficult to target, several different classes of
antineoplastic agents downregulate Sp transcription factors
and these include natural products and their derivatives,
metformin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and
ROS-inducing anticancer agents, including isothiocyanates,

each treatment group, and significantly (p<0.05) decreased changes in gene expression are indicated (*).

piperlongumine and arsenic trioxide [14, 18–21]. Moreover,
drugs, such as ascorbate, tolfenamic acid and betulinic acid
that downregulate Sp proteins, are highly effective in drug
combinations for inhibiting tumor growth in laboratory
animal studies [52–54]. The choice of a specific drug for
targeting Sp TFs will be tumor-specific and dependent on
pharmacokinetics and efficient delivery of the specific agent
to the tumor site. Important advantages for development and
clinical applications of anticancer agents that target Sp1, Sp3
and Sp4 include: (a) Sp protein expression in non-tumor
tissue is relatively low; (b) in cancer cells, these compounds
decrease Sp-regulated genes such as EGFR, VEGF, cMET
and other tyrosine kinases that are themselves individual
drug targets; and (c) these agents also decrease expression of
drug resistance genes (survivin, MDR1) [14] and are ideal for
drug combination therapies. Since Sp3 and Sp4 exhibit prooncogenic activities and are highly expressed in cancer cells,
we are currently investigating the prognostic significance of
Sp3 and Sp4 and comparing the results with previous studies
on Sp1 to determine which Sp transcription factors (individual
or combined) are the most accurate for patient prognosis.

Xenograft studies
Female athymic nude mice (4-6 weeks old) were
purchased as previously described [21]. L3.6pL cells
in culture were transfected with 100 nM of siCtl (7
mice), siSp1 (7 mice), or siSp1, 3, 4 (7 mice). After 48
hr, 1.0 x106 cells were suspended in Matrigel (1:1 ratio)
and injected into the right flank of athymic nude mice.
Tumor volumes, tumor weights, and tumor lysates were
determined and analyzed as previously described [21].
L3.6pL mice rapidly develop tumors in a xenograft model
(10-14 days) and within this time period, we observed
efficient and persistent decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3
and Sp4 proteins using oligonucleotides compared to
shRNAs.
