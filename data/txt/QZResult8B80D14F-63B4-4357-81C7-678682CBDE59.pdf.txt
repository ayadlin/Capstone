BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to compare the clinical outcomes and toxicity in patients treated
with postoperative chemoradiotherapy for gastric cancer using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus 3dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT). METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer were treated postoperatively: 26 with 3D CRT and 31 with IMRT. Concurrent chemotherapy was capecitabine (n ¼ 31), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (n ¼ 25), or none (n ¼ 1). The median radiation dose was 45 Gy. Dose volume
histogram parameters for kidney and liver were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: The 2-year overall
survival rates for 3D CRT versus IMRT were 51% and 65%, respectively (P ¼ .5). Four locoregional failures occurred
each in the 3D CRT (15%) and the IMRT (13%) patients. Grade 2 acute gastrointestinal toxicity was found to be similar between the 3D CRT and IMRT patients (61.5% vs 61.2%, respectively) but more treatment breaks were needed (3
vs 0, respectively). The median serum creatinine from before radiotherapy to most recent creatinine was unchanged
in the IMRT group (0.80 mg/dL) but increased in the 3D CRT group from 0.80 mg/dL to 1.0 mg/dL (P ¼ .02). The median kidney mean dose was higher in the IMRT versus the 3D CRT group (13.9 Gy vs 11.1 Gy; P ¼ .05). The median kidney V20 was lower for the IMRT versus the 3D CRT group (17.5% vs 22%; P ¼ .17). The median liver mean dose for
IMRT and 3D CRT was 13.6 Gy and 18.6 Gy, respectively (P ¼ .19). The median liver V30 was 16.1% and 28%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was well tolerated. IMRT was found to provide sparC 2010 American Cancer Society.

There were expected to be 21,130 new cases of gastric cancer reported in the United States in 2009.1 Locoregional

recurrence is a significant problem with a reported rate of 23% to 38%,2-4 emphasizing the need for adjuvant local therapy. In the Intergroup 0116 trial, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy improved 3-year median survival to 36 months compared
with 27 months in the surgery only arm,5 establishing chemoradiotherapy as the standard adjuvant therapy for patients
with high-risk, resected gastric adenocarcinoma.
Large radiation fields are required to adequately cover the resection bed and lymph node regions at risk of harboring
micrometastatic disease. However, given the large treatment volumes together with concurrent chemotherapy, toxicities may
be considerable. Patients who received chemoradiotherapy in the Intergroup study had a 41% rate of grade 3 toxicity, a 32%
rate of grade 4 toxicity, and a 1% rate of grade 5 toxicity. In addition, 17% of patients had to withdraw from therapy early.5
The standard target dose of 45 grays (Gy) exceeds the tolerance of some critical normal tissues, limiting the ability to
deliver higher doses. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been shown in multiple studies to have the potential
of reducing dose to normal critical structures,6-8 but clinical outcomes are limited.

Original Article

Given the poor overall prognosis and significant toxicity due to chemotherapy and large radiation fields, there
is a need to improve standard treatment. IMRT may allow
for higher doses to improve control as well as decrease acute
toxicity by limiting dose to normal structures. Since 2002,
IMRT has been used routinely for the treatment of gastric
cancer as part of chemoradiotherapy after surgical resection.
The objective of the current study was to evaluate clinical
outcomes and toxicity in patients treated with postoperative
chemoradiotherapy for gastric cancer with IMRT compared
with a group of patients treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) at a single institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
From December 1998 to June 2008, 61 patients with nonmetastatic gastric or gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer
were treated with postoperative radiotherapy at Stanford
University. Two patients treated with IMRT and 2 patients
treated with 3D CRT who did not complete their radiation
course were excluded, leaving 57 patients for this analysis.
Twenty-six patients (46%) received 3D CRT and 31
patients (54%) received IMRT. Earlier patients were treated
with 3D CRT; however, there was a gradual shift of practice
toward IMRT beginning in 2002. All patients had pathology
confirmed at Stanford. Disease was limited to the stomach
or GE junction and regional lymph nodes. Patients were
staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis staging (TNM) classification.9
All patients underwent routine systemic workup and
disease evaluation that included history and physical examination, routine laboratory studies, computed tomography
(CT) of the chest and abdomen, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. Fifty-three patients (93%) received
chemotherapy that was fluorouracil-based (5-fluorouracil
[5-FU] or capecitabine) with or without carboplatin before
the start of radiotherapy, the latter regimen being part of an
institutional protocol. One patient received epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (EOX). The majority of patients
received 2 cycles before radiation. Patients received concurrent chemotherapy with capecitabine (n ¼ 31), 5-FU (n ¼
25), or none (n ¼ 1). After the completion of radiotherapy,
45 patients (79%) received 1 to 2 cycles of the same chemotherapy that was given before radiation, as directed by their
medical oncologist.
Radiation Treatment
Specific characteristics of radiation treatment, including
dose and fractionation, were determined by reviewing

3944

radiation treatment charts and computerized radiation
plans. All patients underwent CT-based treatment planning and were immobilized using an Alpha Cradle
(Smithers Medical Products Inc, Hudson, OH). The target and normal adjacent structures were contoured on the
planning CT scan. The clinical target volume (CTV) in
general followed previously published guidelines10,11 and
included the preoperative stomach volume, surgical bed
including the gastric remnant, and perigastric lymph
nodes. Other lymph node areas such as mediastinal, porta
hepatis, splenic hilum, pancreaticoduodenal, and peripancreatic were included if at risk based on primary tumor
location or involvement of lymph nodes pathologically.
For the bowel, the intestinal loops outside the planning
treatment volume (PTV) were contoured, not the whole
abdominal space. To account for daily setup error and
organ motion, the CTV to PTV expansion was typically 5
to 10 mm. Normal structures were also contoured,
including kidneys, liver, spinal cord, and bowel.
Radiation plans for 3D CRT were generated using
FOCUS (Focus, CMS, Elekta, Maryland Heights, MO) for
23 patients or Eclipse (Eclipse, Varian, Palo Alto, CA) for 3
patients. Patients were treated with either a 3- or 4-field technique to 43.2 to 50.4 Gy (median, 45 Gy), 5 days a week.
IMRT plans were generated using commercial planning
software (Eclipse). The PTV received a median dose of 45
Gy (range, 41.4-54 Gy) with a median fraction size of 1.8
Gy (range, 1.8-2.08 Gy). Although the median doses were
similar between the treatment groups, more patients received
>45 Gy in the IMRT group than in the 3D CRT group (10
vs 2, respectively). For the 12 patients who received >45 Gy,
the additional 5 to 9 Gy were given a sequential conedown
or simultaneous integrated boost. Six patients with positive
margins and 2 patients with close margins received >45 Gy.
Twenty-three patients treated with IMRT were treated with
respiratory gating while all other patients were treated with
free breathing. Beam energies used included 6 megavolts
(MV), 10 MV, 15 MV, or a mix of 6 and 15 MV.
Dose constraint guidelines used for IMRT planning
included: 75% of the liver, <15 Gy; mean liver dose, <20
Gy; 70% of each kidney, <15 Gy or two-thirds of 1 kidney <18 Gy; and 95% of the bowel, <45 Gy. Maximum
dose to the bowel was <54 Gy. For the purposes of planning, the bowel space was contoured. The spinal cord
dose was limited to 45 Gy. The IMRT plans were normalized to 95% volume to get 100% of the dose. Guidelines
were adhered to as closely as possible. For each patient,
the plan was reviewed to ensure optimal target coverage
while minimizing dose to the normal structures.

The median dose was similar in both groups; however, more patients in the IMRT group received doses >45 Gy compared with the 3D RT group.

The dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters
were compared between the 3D CRT group and the
IMRT group. However, because of differences in patient
anatomy, direct comparison is somewhat confounded. An
additional analysis was performed comparing the volume
that received 42.75 Gy (95% of 45 Gy) between the 2
patient groups to determine if more normal tissue was
receiving near-prescription dose.
Statistical Analysis
All patients were followed routinely with physical examinations, CT imaging, and serum measurements at 3- to 6month intervals. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
calculate actuarial rates of locoregional control (LRC),

Time to event was calculated as the time interval from the
first date of radiation to the date of death or the first disease recurrence. Log-rank statistic was used to correlate
various clinical and treatment characteristics with LRC,
DFS, and OS. Multivariate analysis was not performed
due to small patient numbers. All patients were seen at
least weekly during radiation treatment, and acute toxicities were monitored. Toxicities were scored using the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Gastrointestinal (GI) acute toxicity data were
not available for 3 patients who received IMRT. Hematologic acute toxicity was not available for 1 patient who

percentage of kidney receiving 20 Gy (V20), and percentage of liver receiving 30 Gy (V30) for patients
treated with 3D CRT were compared with IMRT using
the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics
Characteristics of the 57 patients are summarized in
Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 58.7 years
(range, 28.9-82.8 years). The median follow-up for the
3D CRT patients was 1.3 years (range, 0.1-9.4 years), and

3946

the median follow-up for the IMRT patients was 1.3 years
(range, 0.4-4.1 years). There was no difference between
the 3D CRT and IMRT groups noted with respect to age
at diagnosis, gender, grade of tumor, stage, percentage
positive lymph nodes, margin status, and chemotherapy.
Clinical Outcome
At the time of last follow-up, 20 patients had died of progressive disease, 4 were alive with progressive disease, and
33 patients were alive with no evidence of disease. The
median OS (Fig. 1A) and DFS from the initiation of
radiotherapy was 5.4 years and 4.7 years, respectively. The
2-year OS for the 3D CRT and IMRT groups was 51%
and 65%, respectively (P ¼ .5) (Fig. 1B). The 2-year DFS

respectively (P ¼ .8) (Fig. 1C). The 2-year local control
rate for the 3D CRT and IMRT groups was 83% and
81%, respectively (P ¼ .9) (Fig. 1D).
Four local-regional failures occurred each in the 3D
CRT (15%) and the IMRT (13%) groups. Time to
locoregional recurrence ranged from 3.9 to 56.0 months.
In the 3D CRT group, 1 failure occurred at the anastomotic site and this patient simultaneously presented with
liver metastases. This patient had a positive margin at the
esophagus. In the IMRT group, 2 of the failures occurred
at the anastomosis site. One patient had close surgical
margins (2 mm) and also presented with pulmonary nod-

Acute and Long-Term Toxicity
Fourteen patients (24.6%) had feeding tubes placed before
the initiation of radiotherapy. No feeding tube was placed
during radiotherapy. Three patients required a treatment
break of a median duration of 7 days due to toxicity in the
3D CRT group (range, 4-10 days), whereas no patient in
the IMRT group required a treatment break. Grade 2 or
higher acute GI toxicity was noted in 61.5% and 61.2% of
patients in the 3D CRT and IMRT groups, respectively.
Acute GI toxicity is shown in Table 2. Grade 2 or higher hematologic toxicity during radiotherapy was seen in 35%
and 29% of the patients in the 3D CRT and IMRT groups,
respectively. Only 8 (14.0%) patients experienced grade 3

nausea. Mean weight loss was 5.4 pounds (range, 0-18
pounds). Mean percent weight loss was 3.7% (range, 0 ¼

(10.8% weight loss) with respect to weight loss.
Forty-nine patients had >6 months follow-up after
the completion of radiotherapy. Late toxicity was noted
for patients in the absence of progressive disease. Among
the 3D CRT patients, 1 patient died of small bowel perforation requiring surgical intervention (grade 5). Grade 3
late toxicity was experienced by 3 patients who developed
small bowel obstruction. Two patients developed grade 2
late toxicity (jaundice and esophagitis).
For the IMRT group, grade 3 late toxicity was experienced by 1 patient who had a stricture requiring surgery.
Grade 2 late toxicity was experienced by 3 patients: 1 with
gastritis, 1 with esophagitis, and 1 with an ulcer.

IMRT Versus 3D for Gastric Cancer/Minn et al

Among the patients treated with IMRT, the median
preradiation serum creatinine and most recent disease-free
postradiation level were both 0.80 mg/dL, respectively.
The median length of time from preradiation creatinine
to recent creatinine was 1.2 years (range, 0.3-4.0 years).
An increase in the median creatinine levels in preradiation
versus postradiation was observed among patients treated
with 3D CRT (0.80 mg/dL and 1.0 mg/dL, respectively;
P ¼ .02). The median length of time between the preradiation creatinine and most recent disease-free creatinine
was 0.9 years (range, 0.3-9.5 years).
DVH Data
DVH data are detailed in Table 3. The median volume
receiving 42.75 Gy for 3D CRT versus IMRT was 1606
cm3 versus 1282.6 cm3, respectively (P ¼ .048). Figure 2
shows an example of a plan for 3D CRT and IMRT. The
median kidney mean dose of both kidneys as a single
organ was higher in the IMRT group versus the 3D CRT
group (13.9 Gy vs 11.1 Gy, P ¼ .05). The median V20
for both kidneys as a single organ was lower for the IMRT
group versus the 3D CRT group (18% vs 22%), but this
difference was not found to be statistically significant (P
¼ .18). The median right kidney mean dose was higher
for the IMRT group versus the 3D CRT group (11.9 Gy
vs 10.4 Gy; P ¼ .04). There was no difference in V20 for
the right kidney for the 3D CRT versus the IMRT group
(P ¼ .55). Similarly, the median left kidney mean dose
was higher for the IMRT group (15.3 Gy) compared with
the 3D CRT group (12.1 Gy), and this difference was
nearly significant (P ¼ .06). The median V20 for the left
kidney was nonsignificantly lower in the IMRT group
compared with the 3D CRT group (22.2% vs 32.0%;
P ¼ .31).
The median mean liver dose for 3D CRT and
IMRT was 18.6 Gy and 17.3 Gy, respectively (P ¼ .19).
The median liver volume treated above 30 Gy (V30) was
28% and 16.1%, respectively (P < .001), which was
highly statistically significant. For the IMRT patients, the
median bowel space maximum dose was 50.7 Gy (range,
48.1-61.5 Gy), V50 was 0.4 cc (range, 0-187.7 cc), and
V45 was 297.5 cc (range, 133.3-871.8 cc). Bowel DVH
data are not available for the 3D RT group.

of the upper and mid-abdomen to encompass the preoperative tumor bed and regional lymph nodes, leading to
significant side effects. As a result, 17% did not complete
their therapy due to toxicity. In addition, 33% of the
patients experienced grade 3 or higher GI toxicity. Given
the formidable size of standard 2D or 3D fields, the desire
to avoid the risk of acute toxicity likely contributed in part
to the 35% deviations of the radiation plans that required
corrections in that trial.
The outcomes for gastric cancer continue to be
poor, and the toxicity from treatment with chemotherapy
and 3D CRT is high. There is a need to improve the treatment for gastric cancer due to treatment-related morbidity. IMRT may allow us to increase dose in hopes of
improving disease control while decreasing the toxicity
profile previously observed with 3D CRT, and the toxicity noted in the current series compares favorably with the
Intergroup 0116 trial. No treatment breaks were needed
among patients treated with IMRT compared with those
treated with 3D CRT. Compared with the 41% rate of
grade 3 toxicity, the 32% rate of grade 4 toxicity, and the
1% rate of grade 5 toxicity noted in the Intergroup study,
the IMRT patients in the current study had a 26% rate of
grade 3 and no grade 4 or 5 GI toxicity. There was 10%
grade 3 hematologic toxicity with no grade 4 or 5 toxicity,
and these were typically observed at the initiation of RT,
suggesting that these may be related to pre-RT chemotherapy treatment. Although differences in the chemotherapy regimens may confound this type of direct
comparison, the toxicity profile with IMRT does appear
to be tolerable. It should be noted, however, that the
group of patients in the current study who were treated
with 3D CRT also experienced a similarly low rate of
grade 3 toxicity.
Recently, postoperative gastric cancer patients have
been treated with IMRT at our institution in hopes of
decreasing acute and late toxicity. This study was undertaken to compare the results of 3D CRT with those of
IMRT. It is difficult to control for confounding variables
when comparing patients from different time periods,
and there are well-recognized limitations of retrospective
studies of this kind. However, we believe that the 2 patient
groups are well-balanced with respect to baseline, disease,
and treatment characteristics, which is a relative strength
of this study. Because of institutional standards, patients
who received chemotherapy at Stanford during this study
period were treated with a similar regimen, whereas those
receiving chemotherapy at another institution had more

varied drugs. The lack of significant differences in chemotherapy regimens (namely carboplatin-based versus noncarboplatin-based) is important because it can confound
both the survival as well as toxicity analysis.
The most important finding in the current study is
that disease outcome is not significantly different between
patients treated with IMRT versus those treated with 3D
CRT. We would not necessarily expect improvement in
survival with IMRT without changes in dose or prevention of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. However, it is important to note that the implementation of
IMRT has not caused a decrease in LRC or OS due to
errors in defining target volumes or quality assurance.
Therefore, to justify using IMRT, a reduction in acute
and/or late toxicity should be demonstrated. In this study,
no treatment breaks were required in the group receiving
IMRT compared with 11.5% of patients in the 3D CRT
group requiring a treatment break of a median of 7 days.
No patients required the placement of a feeding tube during their radiotherapy. These results are particularly
encouraging given that more patients in the IMRT group
received higher doses of radiation.
Toxicity was not found to be worse in the IMRT
group compared with the 3D CRT group despite the use
of higher doses in more cases. In addition, the use of
IMRT allowed for more conformal coverage of our PTV
and less tissue needing to received 95% of the prescription dose despite higher prescription doses, as compared
with the 3D CRT plans (P ¼ .048).
We observed that IMRT, compared with 3D CRT
planning, had improved sparing of the liver (V30 was
16.1% vs 28% for IMRT and 3D CRT, respectively; P <
.001). Similarly, the median V20 for kidneys was lower in
IMRT compared with 3D CRT, but this difference was not
statistically different. Conversely, the mean dose was higher
for the IMRT plans compared with the 3D CRT plans.
The higher mean dose among the IMRT patients may be
due to more patients receiving >45 Gy to the target. However, an important point to note is that these data are not
based on replanning patients using the same CT data set for
side-by-side comparison of DVH parameters. Rather, we
analyzed the normal organ DVHs of radiation plans
actually delivered to the patient to correlate short- and longterm toxicity. Thus, there may be variation in target definition, radiotherapy field design, and dose due to differences
in patient anatomy, different treatment periods, and the
individual preferences of multiple treating physicians.
Other institutions have also reported improvements
in dose to normal structures. In a study comparing IMRT

3950

and 3D CRT plans at Princess Margaret Hospital, IMRT
was preferred in 17 of 19 cases, chosen by blinded radiation oncologists.6 In 4 of the plans, the radiation oncologists were concerned because the spinal cord dose
approached tolerance, and there were potential hotspots
in the small bowel. However, the authors found that
IMRT provided better PTV coverage and better sparing
of the spinal cord, liver, kidneys, and heart in the majority
of cases. It was believed that the cases in which the conformal plans were chosen could have been successfully
treated with IMRT with an opportunity for further optimization. In addition, correction for organ motion was
not done. The median kidney dose was reduced up to
50% in IMRT plans, in another study.7 In another small
study, IMRT reduced the volume of left or right kidney
receiving >20 Gy and the volume of liver receiving >30
Gy.8 No grade 3 acute toxicity during radiotherapy was
noted in these patients treated to 50.4 Gy. Lastly, IMRT
with oxaliplatin/capecitabine (XELOX) was shown to
improve OS and disease DFS without late grade 2 renal
toxicity.13
Similar to our study, other institutions have similarly reported mixed results when comparing IMRT with
3D CRT. In a study by Chung et al, a dosimetric advantage of IMRT over 3D CRT was not observed.14 They
found that, although IMRT plans led to lower liver doses
and improved PTV coverage, there was no significant
reduction in kidney dose. Further optimizations were able
to improve kidney, liver, and spinal cord doses. Another
recent study showed only marginal benefit in the adjuvant
therapy for gastric cancer with IMRT with respect to spine
and kidney dose.15
In the current study, despite no clear advantage to
kidney sparing with IMRT, there may still be some kidney
function preservation. In the patients treated with 3D
CRT, the serum creatinine increased from the pretreatment baseline level, whereas no such increase was observed
in the IMRT patients. However, creatinine clearance may
be a better measure for evaluating renal function. Jansen
et al also showed that, with adjuvant 3D CRT, serum creatinine was elevated 1 year after treatment.16 To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that
IMRT can potentially preserve kidney function over 3D
CRT. These results appear to suggest that the mean kidney dose, which was higher with IMRT, may not be as important for kidney preservation as much as the V20,
which was lower with IMRT, because the threshold tolerance of the kidney is believed to be approximately 20 Gy.
In the study by Jansen et al, both the V20 and mean

kidney dose correlated with late renal function.14 Longer
follow-up is needed to further evaluate kidney function
and its relation to kidney dose.
Two studies have suggested that smaller fraction
doses may decrease renal toxicity and may potentially
improve renal tolerance. There was significant renal damage noted in guinea pig kidneys that received 80 to 81 Gy
in 2- to 3-Gy fractions as compared with kidneys receiving
the same total dose in a hyperfractionated regimen in
1-Gy fractions.17 Similarly, reducing the dose per fraction
demonstrated decreased renal damage in mice that underwent total body irradiation in preparation for bone marrow transplantation.18 These data provide further support
for the use of IMRT because it allows smaller fraction sizes
to the kidney.
A limitation of the current study is the small patient
numbers and short follow-up. Another limitation is that
we do not have direct comparison of 3D CRT and IMRT
for each patient, as some of the previous studies have
done. However, the plans were optimized for each patient
whether 3D CRT or IMRT was used and therefore we are
comparing plans that were deemed acceptable for treatment at our institution. Finally, because 3D CRT patients
were treated earlier in this series, there is unequal longterm follow-up lengths for the 2 treatment groups,
although the median follow-up lengths and time between
creatinine levels were similar. Further follow-up is certainly needed to reveal possible differences in late toxicity
between the groups.
Although the data are not consistent in demonstrating an advantage of IMRT over 3D CRT, there may be
some gains in acute toxicities with the use of IMRT
because of generally decreased dose to normal organs such
as bowel, kidney, and liver. In addition, IMRT may allow
for dose escalation in the hopes to improve disease control, especially in cases such as close/positive margins,
extranodal disease spread, or other situations believed to
have a high risk of residual microscopic disease, without
increasing the dose to critical structures. The incorporation of image guidance likely confers additional improvements. Further investigation is required to determine the
true clinical benefit of IMRT for this disease, and we
believe it is highly warranted given the generally poor outcomes of this disease and the high rate of treatment
morbidity.
Conclusions
Although LRC is good with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy
overall outcomes for gastric cancer remain poor. Improve-

ments in both local and systemic therapy are required. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was well tolerated with either
3D CRT or IMRT, with similar acute and late toxicities
reported. Despite higher doses used, IMRT provides sparing to the liver and possibly the kidneys. Although the
dosimetric advantage of IMRT for the kidneys was not
consistent, renal function appears to be preserved better.
These results need to be validated with longer follow-up
as well as in larger studies.
