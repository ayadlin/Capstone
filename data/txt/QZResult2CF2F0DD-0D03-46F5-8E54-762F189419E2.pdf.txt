Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated therapeutic target in cancer and EGFR antagonists
with greater effectiveness than existing clinical agents remain of interest. Here, we report a novel approach
based on Sym004, a mixture of two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct nonoverlapping
epitopes in EGFR extracellular domain III. Like anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in current clinical use,
Sym004 inhibits cancer cell growth and survival by blocking ligand-binding receptor activation and phosphorylation and downstream receptor signaling. However, unlike the other antibodies, Sym004 induces rapid and
efficient removal of the receptor from the cancer cell surface by triggering EGFR internalization and degradation. Compared with reference anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, Sym004 exhibited more pronounced
growth inhibition in vitro and superior efficacy in vivo. Together, these findings illustrate a strategy to target
EGFR more effectively than existing clinical antibodies. Cancer Res; 70(2); 588–97. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1)
signaling system is frequently unbalanced in human malignancies due to increased ligand production, receptor
overexpression, receptor mutations, and/or cross-talk with
other receptor systems (1–3). Changes in EGFR status
have been linked to the development and maintenance
of a malignant phenotype and correlated to poor clinical
prognosis (4). For this reason, the EGFR is an attractive
target for anticancer therapy (5).
Currently, two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting
the EGFR, cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix),
are approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and additional mAbs are in clinical development for various indications (6).
Cetuximab and panitumumab have been shown to inhibit
ligand binding, receptor heterodimerization, and downstream signaling by binding to extracellular domain III of
the EGFR (7). mAb-mediated engagement of immunologic effector cells by FcγR binding resulting in antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity toward the tumor is another proposed
mechanism of cetuximab (8). Anti-EGFR mAbs have also

been implicated in acceleration of EGFR internalization. This
mechanism is particularly attractive as it mimics ligandinduced endocytosis and degradation of active EGFRs, an important native state physiologic process responsible for
attenuation of growth-promoting signals (9). Recently, it
has been shown that certain combinations of antibodies
can be considerably more potent at inducing downregulation
of receptor tyrosine kinases and that such antibody mixtures
may be superior at controlling tumor growth (10, 11).
Here, we present a novel antibody mixture containing
two antibodies targeting the EGFR and with superior anticancer efficacy compared with existing mAbs. Using the
mSymplex technology, we identified a comprehensive repertoire of EGFR-specific antibodies from which a diverse
subset was characterized in detail. Using an efficacy-based
approach, >400 different antibody combinations were tested in a standard viability assay in vitro. Three lead candidate mixtures with high efficacy in vitro were selected and
tested for their ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo.1 A
combination of two antibodies, 992 and 1024, was identified as the most potent and having the highest efficacy of
all combinations both in vitro and in vivo. This mixture is
referred to as Sym004. The two antibodies in Sym004 are
directed against distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of EGFR. Here, we present data from the functional
characterization of Sym004.

Sym004—A Novel Anti-EGFR Antibody Mixture

Materials and Methods
Materials. Anti-EGFR mAbs cetuximab (Erbitux, Merck)
and panitumumab (Vectibix, Amgen) and negative control
anti–respiratory syncytial virus mAb Synagis (Abbott) were
used. The mSymplex identification, cloning, and characterization of the 992, 1024, and 1030 antibodies are described
by Koefoed and colleagues.1 The mSymplex technology is a
murine variant of the Symplex technology used for human B
cells (12). The mSymplex method is a PCR-based method for
cloning of antibodies from single-sorted murine plasma cells.
Due to the single PCR step, the natural heavy and light chain
pairing is maintained for the antibodies. The antibodies 992
and 1024 were stored individually at −80°C or at 4°C for shorter
periods. Before performing experiments, the two antibodies
were mixed in a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) and immediately thereafter
added to experimental wells or injected into mice. Antibodies
against phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR; Tyr 845 ), pEGFR
(Tyr 1045 ), pEGFR (Tyr 1068 ), phosphorylated extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (pERK) 1/2 (Thr202/Thr204), ERK1/2,
AKT, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT; Ser473), PDK1, phosphorylated PDK1 (Ser 241 ), S6R, phosphorylated S6R (pS6R),
p21CIP, and β-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. Sheep anti-human EGFR was from Fitzgerald,
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies were from DakoCytomation, and 800CW-conjugated
secondary antibodies were from LI-COR Biosciences.
Cell lines. The following cancer cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection: A431, A431NS,
A549, AU565, BT20, BT474, CALU3, DU145, H1975, H292,
HCC827, HT29, MDA-MB-468, Mia-PACA2, PC3, SKBR3, and
SKOV3. The A431NS cell line was derived from the parental
cell line A431 in 1997 by repeated subculturing to select cells
that detach from the substrate easily (13). The A431 and
A431NS cell lines have similar levels of EGFR, pEGFR, and
HER2, but A431NS has a higher rate of proliferation in vitro
and is more aggressive in vivo.
The cell line HN5 was from the Department of Radiation
Biology, Copenhagen University Hospital (Copenhagen, Denmark). The colon cancer cell line GEO has been described
previously (14) and was a generous gift from Professor Douglas Boyd (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). All
cells were maintained in appropriate medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/mL penicillin,
and 50 μg/mL streptomycin.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis. A ProteOn XPR36
(Bio-Rad) biosensor was used for surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) analysis. Anti-human IgG (Fc) antibody (GE Healthcare) was conjugated to a GLC chip (Bio-Rad) using the manufacturer's recommendations and a flow rate of 25 μL/min.
Soluble EGFR (sEGFR) fused to human IgG Fc (R&D Systems) was captured on the anti-Fc surface followed by injections of saturating concentrations of antibody pairs (40 μg/
mL/267 nmol/L). The surface was regenerated by a 30-s injection of 3 mmol/L MgCl2.
Viability assay. Three-fold serial dilutions of antibodies
were prepared in triplicate in 96-well plates, and cancer cells
were added in medium containing 0.5% FBS. After 96 h, the

www.aacrjournals.org

number of viable cells was measured using the WST-1 Cell
Proliferation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Xenograft studies. Cells (A431NS: 106; HN5: ∼2 × 2 × 2 mm
tumor fragment; H1975: 2 × 106; or HCC827: 5 × 106) suspended in 0.1 mL PBS were inoculated s.c. into the right flank
of 6- to 8-wk-old BALB/c nu/nu mice. Mice were monitored
daily, and tumors were measured two to three times weekly
using calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: 1/2 × L × W2 (L = length; W = width). Antibodies were administered at 25 or 50 mg/kg twice weekly by
i.p. injection. The results are expressed as mean ± SE, and
statistical significance was analyzed using ANOVA followed
by a Student's t test. The tumor volume of animals excluded
before termination of the study was carried through. All
in vivo studies were performed in accordance with the Danish law on animal experimentation and approved by the Animal Ethical Committee, Denmark.
Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Antibodies
were labeled with either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647
using antibody labeling kits (Invitrogen). For the internalization assays, cells were treated with labeled antibodies, fixed
with 4% formaldehyde, and stained with 1 μmol/L Hoechst
(Invitrogen) and 2 μg/mL CellMask Blue (Invitrogen). For
the EGFR degradation assay, cells were treated with unlabeled antibodies, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and then stained
with Alexa Fluor 647–labeled mAb 1030 and a solution of 1
μmol/L Hoechst and 2 μg/mL CellMask Blue. Cells were examined using the Opera LX high-content confocal imaging
system (Perkin-Elmer) at 400× or 600× or using an Olympus
BX microscope. Image analyses were performed using Acapella software (Perkin-Elmer). At least 100 cells were used
for quantifications.
Generation of Fab fragments. Fab fragments of the antibodies 992 and 1024 were generated by papain digestion as
described previously (15).
Immunoblot analyses. Protein levels were determined by
preparing whole-cell lysates from cell lines and xenografts
and analyzed by immunoblot as described previously (16).
Band intensities were quantified using the public domain
Java image-processing program ImageJ.2
For analysis of EGFR signaling, cancer cells were serum
starved overnight and pretreated with 10 μg/mL of control
mAb, Sym004, or cetuximab for 8 h and then left unstimulated or stimulated with 1 nmol/L EGF (R&D Systems) for
7.5 min. Immunoblot analyses were performed with β-actin
as loading control. Bands were visualized by addition of
800CW fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and imaged using the Odyssey System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor tissue samples were collected from A431NS xenografted tumors treated twice weekly
with 50 mg/kg of control mAb, Sym004, or cetuximab for 3
wk. Tumor samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and paraffin embedded. The EGFR pharmDx kit using antibody 18C9

against EGFR and secondary HRP-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (DakoCytomation) was used according to the

substrate. Tissues were counterstained with Mayer's H&E
stain (Bie and Berntsen). Tissues were examined using an
Olympus BX51 microscope. Images were taken at 40× and
200×.

Results
Sym004 binds nonoverlapping epitopes in the EGFR extracellular domain. Sym004 is a 1:1 mixture of the two chimeric IgG1 antibodies 992 and 1024, which have been shown
to bind two distinct nonoverlapping epitopes on the extracellular domain III of EGFR with high affinities.1 To confirm simultaneous binding of the two antibodies to EGFR, a surface

590

Cancer Res; 70(2) January 15, 2010

plasmon resonance analysis was performed measuring binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR. Figure 1A shows
that the two antibodies can bind simultaneously to the extracellular domain of EGFR.
Sym004 synergistically inhibits cancer cell growth
in vitro. The potency and efficacy of Sym004 in inhibiting
cancer cell growth were investigated in a range of cancer cell
lines of different tissue origin and with varying EGFR levels
(see Supplementary Table S1 for IC50 values). Eleven of the 19
cell lines tested were inhibited by Sym004, whereas only 7 cell
lines were inhibited by the individual 992 and 1024 mAbs. An
example of antibody-induced growth inhibition is shown for
the HCC827 cell line in Fig. 1B. The results show that Sym004
is more potent at inhibiting the growth of this cell line compared with 992 and 1024.
The optimal ratio between 992 and 1024 in the mixture
was tested in growth inhibition assays with A431NS and

HCC827 cells, respectively (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1). In
both cell lines, the 1:1 (w/w) mixture was the most potent
and the IC50 increased when the ratio was altered toward
1:250 or 250:1. However, the effect of the antibody combina-

tion on cell proliferation proved very robust over a wide
range of ratios, as the initial decreases in potencies when
moving away from the optimal 1:1 mixture were relatively
small.

mechanism of action.

To investigate whether 992 and 1024 work in true synergy,
the theoretically determined, so-called additive isobole at the
50% level of inhibition of A431NS cell growth (IC50) was
calculated from the individual antibody titration curves
(Fig. 1C), as described by Tallarida (17). Plotting the experimentally determined IC50 values for the A431NS cell growth
inhibition for all dose pairs of 992 and 1024 in the isobologram (Fig. 1D) showed that they were significantly below the
theoretically determined additive isobole, showing that the
two antibodies act highly synergistically (17). It is also evident that the 1:1 ratio is the mixture displaying the strongest
level of synergy, as it lies furthest away from the additive
isobole (Fig. 1D).
Sym004 induces efficient internalization of EGFR on
cancer cells. Cancer cell lines were treated with different
concentrations of Alexa Fluor 488–labeled antibodies for
varying periods of time (Fig. 2A). After 15 minutes of incuba-

592

Cancer Res; 70(2) January 15, 2010

tion, both Sym004 and cetuximab were located at the cell
surface. Following a 4-hour incubation period, most of the
reference mAb cetuximab was still located on the cell surface
and cells contained only very few visible intracellular antibody-containing vesicles. In contrast, most of the antibody
in Sym004-treated cells was located in intracellular vesicles.
The Sym004-induced EGFR internalization was preceded by
a clustering of receptor-antibody complexes at the cell surface, as shown in Fig. 2A (right).
Internalization was quantified by counting the number of
visible vesicles in each cell section (Fig. 2B). Sym004-treated
cells had a significantly higher number of vesicles (two to
three times) in all concentrations tested, and they appeared
much faster than in cells treated with mAbs. Maximal potency and efficacy of Sym004 were found to be dependent on the
bivalency of the two antibodies because a mixture of 992 and
1024 Fab fragments was unable to inhibit the proliferation of

HN5 cells (Fig. 2C). Cross-linking of the Fab fragments with
an anti-Fab IgG increased potency and maximized efficacy.
In line with these observations, the Fab fragment mixture
failed to induce EGFR internalization (Fig. 2D), whereas
cross-linking of the Fab fragments partially restored the ability to internalize EGFR (data not shown).
Sym004-induced internalization of EGFR is followed by
receptor degradation. The fate of internalized receptors was
investigated by immunoblot analyses of EGFR levels in cancer cell lines treated with antibodies for 2, 4, 8, or 24 hours.
The level of EGFR decreased drastically in all four Sym004treated cell lines, whereas only a small decrease in EGFR
levels was seen in cells treated with reference antibodies
(Fig. 3A). Quantification of band intensities showed that
Sym004 removed 50% to 70% of EGFRs within 24 hours in
the four cell lines tested (Fig. 3B). A similar experiment
was performed with the most internalization-resistant cell

line A431NS in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide. Under these conditions, Sym004 completely
removed the EGFR from A431NS cells within 24 hours (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the apparent lower removal
of EGFR in this cell line is due to high ongoing rate of EGFR
protein synthesis. EGFR removal by Sym004 was verified using an Alexa Fluor 647–labeled mAb 1030, which is able to
bind to the EGFR simultaneously with Sym004 or cetuximab.
After 24 hours, Sym004 completely eliminated binding of
mAb 1030 on HN5 cells, whereas mAb 1030 was still able
to bind to cetuximab-treated cells (Fig. 3C). The difference
between the two treatments was statistically significant after
1 hour.
Sym004 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in a range
of xenograft models. To investigate whether the superior
removal of EGFR from cancer cells by Sym004 in vitro
could be translated into a superior antitumor response

in vivo, the efficacy of Sym004 was tested in several xenograft models. For comparison, one or both of the approved
mAbs cetuximab and panitumumab were included in the
studies (Fig. 4).
Initially, the effect of Sym004 on the growth of the very
aggressive A431NS tumor xenografts was evaluated. Both
Sym004 and cetuximab showed a clear dose response.
However, cetuximab at both 25 and 50 mg/kg was only
able to partially suppress the growth of A431NS tumors
(Fig. 4A).
Treatment with 25 mg/kg Sym004 provided stronger tumor suppression compared with cetuximab, and treatment
with 50 mg/kg Sym004 not only suppressed tumor growth
but also induced complete tumor regression in all of the
mice treated. No recurring tumors were detected at day
120 in any of the Sym004-treated mice, showing a longlasting effect of the antibody treatment.
Sym004 and cetuximab were also compared in large tumor xenografts established from the head and neck cancer cell line HN5 (Fig. 4B). Here, Sym004 was able to
control tumor growth with a slight decrease in average
tumor volume, but the observed difference between
Sym004 and cetuximab treatments was not statistically
significant. To extend the observations to tumors of nonsquamous origin, tumor xenografts established from the
non–small cell lung cancer cell lines H1975 and HCC827
with average tumor volumes of 150 mm3 were treated

with Sym004 and either cetuximab or panitumumab
(Fig. 4C and D, respectively). In the H1975 xenograft model, Sym004 significantly delayed tumor growth compared
with cetuximab. Sym004 at 50 mg/kg also caused rapid
and complete regression of all tumors in the HCC827 xenograft model, with no evidence of tumor recurrence at
day 110 after inoculation. Panitumumab was significantly
less potent at controlling tumor growth, and tumor recurrence was detected in this treatment group 40 days after
discontinuation of treatment.
Sym004 causes complete removal of EGFR in vivo. The
ability of Sym004 to remove EGFR in vivo was investigated in
A431NS tumors. The EGFR levels in individual tumors were
evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Sym004-treated tumors
were completely devoid of EGFR, whereas cetuximab-treated
tumors contained significant levels of EGFR, although lower
than control-treated tumors (Fig. 5A and B). These findings
were verified in tissue sections of the tumors by immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR (Fig. 5C). Control mAb-treated
tumors had large areas with viable A431NS cells with high
levels of EGFR (dark brown areas). In cetuximab-treated tumors, keratin pearls were clearly visible (Fig. 5C, black arrows), but dispersed between these were large areas of
viable tumor cells with high levels of EGFR expression. In
contrast, Sym004-treated tumors contained no areas positive
for EGFR and most of the tumor volume consisted of keratin
(Fig. 5C).

Sym004—A Novel Anti-EGFR Antibody Mixture

Figure 6. Sym004 is less sensitive to acquired resistance due to increased ligand levels. A, metabolic activity of HN5 head and neck cancer cells treated

Sym004 treatment is less sensitive to ligand-dependent
resistance. Acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy caused by increased ligand production was modeled in
a viability assay by addition of different concentrations of
EGF to HN5, GEO, and A431NS cancer cells simultaneously
with 10 μg/mL of antibody (Fig. 6A–C). Increasing amounts
of EGF increased cell proliferation and made the cells completely or partially resistant to cetuximab treatment. Sym004
potently inhibited proliferation of these cell lines in the
presence of EGF, showing that removal of EGFR from the
cancer cells is a more efficient way of blocking ligandinduced proliferation.
Sym004-induced downregulation of EGFR inhibits
ligand-induced phosphorylation of downstream signaling
molecules. To further investigate the mechanisms underly-

www.aacrjournals.org

ing the superior inhibitory potential of Sym004 in the presence of ligand, phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream
signaling molecules was investigated in the cell lines
A431NS and HN5 (Fig. 6D). In the presence and absence
of ligand, Sym004 treatment led to a more potent blockade
of EGFR phosphorylation at the sites Tyr845, Tyr1045, and
Tyr1068 compared with cetuximab. Similar results were
found for phosphorylation of ERK in the presence of ligand. Sym004 was also more potent than cetuximab at inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT, PDK1, and S6R in the
HN5 cell line, whereas these molecules were constitutively
phosphorylated and unresponsive to anti-EGFR antibodies
in the A431NS cell line. Sym004 treatment also led to superior induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP/WAF1 in
the HN5 cell line.

Discussion
Development of more efficacious cancer treatment is important to effectively treat and hopefully cure more patients.
With the aim of identifying anti-EGFR antibody mixtures
with superior efficacy over mAbs, we screened a large panel
of mAb mixtures for high antiproliferative activity in vitro
and in vivo.1 Sym004 was identified as the most potent and
efficacious combination and consists of an equal amount of
the two mAbs 992 and 1024.
In the current work, we show that 992 and 1024 work highly synergistically when combined. The synergy is due to very
efficient induction of EGFR internalization and subsequent
degradation, as shown in a range of cancer cell lines of
different tissue origin. Internalization was preceded by formation of antibody-EGFR complexes at the cell surface,
presumably caused by cross-linking of receptors by the antibodies, as previously suggested by Friedman and colleagues
(10), as a general mechanism of action for antibodies with
nonoverlapping epitopes binding to receptor tyrosine kinases.
Further, evidence that cross-linking of EGFR is involved in
Sym004-induced internalization is provided by the observation that a mixture of 992- and 1024-derived Fab fragments
failed to induce EGFR internalization.
The internalization of EGFR by Sym004 is a prerequisite
for efficient tumor cell growth inhibition, as shown in a viability assay using Fab fragments of 992 and 1024. The Fab
fragment mixture was a much weaker inhibitor of cancer cell
growth than full-length Sym004. Addition of an anti-Fab
bridging antibody partially restored both the potency and
the efficacy of the Fab mixture, and this correlated with increased internalization. Thus, receptor cross-linking by
Sym004 followed by target internalization seems to be a prerequisite for the observed synergy and maximum potency
and efficacy of the mixture (Fig. 3D).
Normally, ligand binding to the EGFR induces rapid internalization, which is followed by recycling of the receptor to
the cell surface or degradation in lysosomes depending on
the signal intensity and the cellular context (18–21).
Sym004-induced internalization of EGFR is slower than ligand-induced internalization and is independent of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, as shown using the selective tyrosine
kinase inhibitor AG1478 (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast
to ligand-induced internalization, Sym004-induced internalization of EGFR is always followed by degradation of the receptor and the bound antibody.
The susceptibility of the EGFR to undergo internalization
and degradation following antibody treatment differed
among the cancer cell lines tested. Although the cell lines
HN5 and A431NS express approximately equal levels of
EGFR, the receptor was internalized and degraded more rapidly in HN5 cells compared with A431NS cells.
Despite the slower speed of EGFR downregulation by
Sym004 on A431NS cells, the removal of EGFR is crucial for
obtaining maximum efficacy in this cell line. The lack of sufficient internalization and degradation of EGFR on A431NS
cells by mAbs such as cetuximab may explain its partial resistance to anti-EGFR mAb therapy both in vitro and in vivo. The

fact that cross-linking of cetuximab by anti-human IgG leads
to increased EGFR internalization and an efficacy comparable
with that of Sym004 supports this hypothesis (Supplementary
Fig. S4). The reason for the decreased rate of EGFR removal by
Sym004 from A431NS cells may be either a failure in the
downregulation machinery or compensatory augmented synthesis of EGFR. The observation that inhibition of new protein
synthesis by cycloheximide addition leads to complete removal of EGFR in A431NS cells by Sym004 favors the latter explanation (Supplementary Fig. S2). Examination of the antitumor
activity of Sym004 in multiple mouse tumor xenograft models
(Fig. 4) confirmed the unique antitumor properties of Sym004.
Tumor eradication of A431NS and HCC827 xenografts was
achieved in all of the mice treated. Furthermore, no signs of
tumor regrowth were observed in the study periods. In the
A431NS tumors, even the low dose of Sym004 was significantly more potent at inhibiting tumor growth than the high dose
of cetuximab. In the two lung cancer xenograft models H1975
and HCC827, Sym004 was significantly more potent at inhibiting tumor growth than cetuximab and panitumumab, respectively. The lack of a statistically significant difference between
Sym004 and cetuximab in the HN5 model was unexpected but
not surprising, as in vitro data have shown that Sym004 and
cetuximab are equally effective at inhibiting the growth of
HN5 in the absence of the ligand (Fig. 6A). The lack of superiority of Sym004 at inhibiting the growth of HN5 cells indicates that complete EGFR internalization and degradation is
superfluous for maximum inhibition of this cell line in the absence of the ligand. The availability of ligands in the xenograft
model thus seems limited.
The currently used therapeutic mAbs targeting EGFR
function primarily by blocking access of ligands to the
ligand-binding area of the receptor and, to a lesser extent,
by inducing receptor internalization and degradation (9).
Efficient removal of the receptor from the cancer cell will
eliminate all interactions of EGFR with other proteins, including those that are independent of the receptor tyrosine
kinase (22). Elimination of all EGFR-dependent interactions
may in turn result in a superior antitumor response and a
reduced ability of tumor cells to acquire resistance to treatment. Of particular relevance in this context is the reinstatement of ligand-induced receptor signaling that can be
observed in the presence of mAbs by a compensatory upregulation of EGFR ligands. Ligands compete with the mAbs
for binding to EGFR at the cancer cell surface, resulting in
treatment desensitization or resistance. Furthermore, the
EGFR dimerization induced by the mAbs may lower the
threshold for ligand activation. The results presented here indicate that ligand is able to cause resistance to mAb therapy
and that Sym004 can overcome this mechanism of resistance
from the competing ligand by effectively removing the receptor from the cell surface. In line with these data, it was
shown that Sym004 was superior to cetuximab at inhibiting
EGFR phosphorylation and downstream signaling to ERK1/2,
PDK1, AKT, and S6R in human cancer cell lines.

receptor or directly with signaling molecules such as SRC is
another way for the cancer cells to escape the effects of EGFR
inhibition (23–26). Removal of EGFR by Sym004 will also
eliminate these interactions.
In conclusion, Sym004 has a mechanism of action that is
different from that of approved mAbs. Due to its distinctive
mechanism of action, Sym004 has superior anticancer
activity in EGFR-dependent tumor xenografts and has the
potential to treat tumors with acquired resistance to other
EGFR-targeted agents, including both mAbs and smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These results thus
provide a clear rationale for evaluating Sym004 in clinical
trials with human EGFR-positive cancers.
