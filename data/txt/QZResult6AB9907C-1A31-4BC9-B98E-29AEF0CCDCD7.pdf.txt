ABSTRACT
α-L-fucosidase 1 (FUCA1) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic
cleavage of the terminal fucose residue in breast cancer cells. FUCA1 mRNA levels
were detected by real-time PCR, and there was a greater than 139-fold increase in
FUCA1 mRNA expression in breast tumor samples compared with normal breast tissue
samples (*P = 0.005, n = 236). Higher FUCA1 mRNA expression was preferentially
detected in early-stage tumors (stage 0 to 2) compared with advanced-stage tumors
(stage 3 to 4) (stage 0-1 versus stage 3, *P = 0.015; stage 0-1 versus stage 4, *P
= 0.024). FUCA1 protein levels were higher in advanced-stage tumors concomitant
with decreased fucosylated Lewis-x antigen expression, as evidenced using the
immunohistochemical staining H-score method (*P < 0.001). Statistical analysis
revealed that lower FUCA1 levels significantly predicted an inferior overall survival
rate among triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients compared with non-TNBC
patients (*P = 0.009). Two stable FUCA1 siRNA knock-down MDA-MB-231 cell lines
were established, and the results suggest that transient FUCA inhibition creates a
selective pressure that triggers the metastasis of primary tumor cells, as detected by
wound healing and invasion assays (*P < 0.01). The results suggest that FUCA1 may
be a potential prognostic molecular target for clinical use, especially in TNBC patients.

INTRODUCTION

non-disseminated colorectal cancer [16]. All of these
studies reported that FUCA is preferentially detected
during the early stages of cancer development. However,
the mechanism by which FUCA is involved in breast
cancer progression is not fully understood.
Secreted FUCA has been identified as the key
enzyme responsible for the defucosylation of terminal
epitopes. For example, a previous study demonstrated that
L-fucose was transferred from the surface of human gastric
cancer cells to a co-cultured clinical strain of H. pylori
[17]. Another study demonstrated that FUCA pretreatment
significantly decreased the invasive capability of MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells [2]; this effect was reversed
by deoxyfuconojirimycin, a specific FUCA inhibitor.
Because α-L-fucose-containing molecules are readily
detected on migratory cancer cells, there is a rationale for
studying the potential ability of FUCA to modify fucose
expression on breast tumor cells. FUCA can remove α-Lfucose from oligosaccharide sites on highly invasive and
metastatic breast cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized
that high FUCA expression could decrease the expression
of fucose-containing molecules on the surface of cancer
cells, thereby significantly inhibiting tumor cell invasion.
In this study, we evaluated FUCA1 expression in
breast cancer tissue samples from patients with different
stage disease. Lower FUCA1 expression was preferentially
detected in tissues from patients with advanced-stage
(stage 3 to 4) breast cancer. TNBC patients often face a
high risk of early relapse that is characterized by extensive
metastasis. A recent study using lectin microarrays
determined that the binding of TNBC cells to Ricinus
communis agglutinin I was proportional to their metastatic
capacity [18]. They also found that this binding inhibited
cellular invasion, migration, and adhesion; a membrane
glycoprotein, POTE ankyrin domain family member F,
was identified that may play a key role in mediating these
effects [18]. Previous studies have shown that aberrant cell
surface glycosylation is associated with cancer metastasis,
suggesting that altered glycosylation might be a diagnostic
indicator of metastatic potential [19]. To strengthen our
hypothesis that FUCA1 is a biomarker for poor prognosis,
we analyzed the correlation between FUCA1 mRNA
expression and disease state and found that lower FUCA1
mRNA levels significantly predicted inferior overall
survival for TNBC patients (*P = 0.009). Our results
suggest that FUCA1 is an indicator of poor prognosis for
patients with advanced-stage TNBC.

Glycosylation drives the specific arrangement of the
linkages between oligosaccharides and glycoproteins or
glycolipids in mammalian cells. Alpha-L-fucose is a key
monosaccharide component that is incorporated on the
surface of breast cancer cells; this component contributes
to many of the fundamental characteristics of breast
tumor progression [1, 2]. Alpha-L-fucose-containing
molecules are necessary for key aspects of neoplastic
progression, including hematogenous metastasis [3],
tumor invasion through extracellular matrices (including
basement membranes) [2], and up-regulation of Notch
signaling [4, 5], with implications for the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition and activation of breast cancer
stem cells. Breast cancer cells incorporate the simple
sugar alpha-L-fucose into glycoproteins and glycolipids
that are associated with the transformation to a malignant
phenotype [1]. For example, the fucosylated Lewis-x
antigen is overexpressed on epithelial cells of various
origins, including breast cancer cells [1, 6]. Additionally,
elevated expression of the Lewis y antigen, which
promotes cancer cell proliferation, has been found in 7090% of human carcinomas of epithelial origin, including
breast cancer [7]. Fucosylated Lewis-x antigen expression
is a unique prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival
and overall survival in younger patients with triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) [6, 8]. Specific targeting of
these proteins with a radiolabeled humanized monoclonal
antibody significantly inhibited tumor growth in an MCF7 breast cancer xenograft model in BALB/c nude mice [9].
These results suggest that fucosylated glycoconjugates on
the breast cancer cell surface can be used as therapeutic
molecules [2, 10, 11].
Most cases of breast cancer originate in the
lactiferous ducts and do not spread beyond the milk
duct into normal surrounding breast tissue; this type of
breast cancer is defined as non-invasive breast cancer
(ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS). A previous study
suggested that lysosomal enzymes are secreted into the
lactiferous ducts; then, these hydrolytic enzymes damage
cells, leading to the initiation of breast cancer [12]. In
the present study, we demonstrated that the lysosomal
enzyme, α-L-fucosidase 1 (FUCA1, EC number 3.2.1.51)
that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of terminal fucose
residues was preferentially detected in early-stage (stage
0 to 2) breast cancer tissues (n = 236, *P = 0.015 and
0.024, respectively). This result suggests that FUCAmediated decreases in the composition and quantity of cell
surface fucosylation-associated molecules could critically
reduce the invasiveness of cancer cells in early-stage
breast cancer. FUCA has also been studied because of its
potential utility in the clinical diagnosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma [13, 14] and colorectal cancer [15]. Another
study demonstrated that FUCA in combination with CD26
represented a molecular diagnostic marker, especially for

RESULTS

(*P = 0.004 and *P = 0.004, respectively). High FUCA1
expression in tumor tissue (T > N) was also associated
with the non-smoking status in these patients (*P = 0.037).
A previous study demonstrated that increased
fucosylation of Lewis-x antigens by 5 fucosyl-transferases
(FUT-3, -4, -5, -6, and -7) was detected in breast cancer
cells that preferentially metastasized to the bone [20].
Moreover, fucosylated Lewis-x antigens are a poor
prognostic factor in younger patients with TNBC [1,6,
8]. Because FUCA1 catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of
the terminal alpha-L-fucose residue in glycoproteins and
glycolipids that are associated with the transformation
to a malignant phenotype [1], we quantified the levels
of fucosylated Lewis-x antigens in breast tumor tissues
with high or low FUCA1 expression using IHC H-score
staining assays, as described in the Materials and
Methods section (Figure 2A, 2B and 2C). FUCA1 was
preferentially detected in early-stage breast cancer tissues
(Table 1, Figures 1C and 2A). Interestingly, lower FUCA1
expression was associated with highly fucosylated Lewis-x
antigens, such as those detected in the advanced-stage
breast cancer tissues (Figure 2A, indicated by a yellow
arrow), and vice versa (Figure 2B and 2C, H-score data).
High FUCA1 expression levels can alter the
composition and decrease the quantity of cell surface
fucosylation-associated molecules, thereby limiting the
invasiveness of early-stage (stage 1 and 2) breast cancer
cells. Next, we investigated whether low FUCA1 levels
were detected in patients with higher levels of fucosylated
Lewis antigen. We divided patients into two groups
according to their FUCA1 H-scores. The mean FUCA1
H-score in 159 breast cancer patients was 273. Therefore,
FUCA1 H-scores < 273 defined the low FUCA1 group
(n = 57), and vice versa (Figure 2B). In the high FUCA1
group, higher FUCA1 expression was concomitantly
detected with lower fucosylated Lewis antigen levels (*P
< 0.001) (Figure 2B and 2C). To further strengthen our
hypothesis that lower FUCA1 expression is a biomarker
of poor prognosis, we analyzed the correlation between
FUCA1 protein levels (indicated by H-score) and overall
survival (Figure 2D). Lower FUCA1 expression was
significantly associated with an inferior overall survival
rate in breast cancer patients (Figure 2D, *P = 0.009).
We subdivided the patients into TNBC and non-TNBC
groups and analyzed the correlation between FUCA1
protein levels (indicated by H-score) and overall survival
in each group (Figure 2D). Interestingly, lower FUCA1
protein expression (H-score < 273) was associated with
poor overall survival among TNBC patients (Figure 2D,
*P = 0.003) but not among non-TNBC patients..
In the statistical analyses, a hazard of 1.000 was
defined as the baseline for patients with the following
conditions: T4, N3, and stage IV. Cox regression
proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate whether
the FUCA1 H-score was a prognostic indicator. The
univariate Cox regression revealed that FUCA1 H-scores

FUCA1 mRNA is more highly expressed in human
breast tumor tissues
FUCA1 mRNA levels were examined in paired
tumor and normal tissue samples by real-time RT-PCR
analysis (n = 236). The average FUCA1 mRNA (copy
number x 103/µg) expression was 139-fold higher in
tumor tissue than in normal cells (Figure 1A, bars 1 vs.
2, *P = 0.005, n = 236). The cases were further divided
into two groups according to FUCA1 mRNA expression.
Nearly 60% (n = 141) of the cases fell into Group 1
(tumor > normal, T > N); in this group, the mean FUCA1
expression level in the tumor samples was 148-fold greater
than that in the normal samples (Figure 1A, bars 3 vs. 4,
*P = 0.001). Within Group 1, higher FUCA1 expression
(defined as > 100-fold) was detected in 58% (82/141) of
the tumor tissue samples (data not shown). However, in
Group 2 (normal > tumor, N > T), the FUCA1 expression
level in 72% (69/95) of the normal tissues was less than
20-fold greater than that in the tumor tissues (Figure 1A,
bars 5 vs. 6).

FUCA1 protein expression is higher in early-stage
breast tumor tissues
On average, elevated FUCA1 mRNA expression
levels were significantly associated with early-stage
tumors rather than advanced-stage tumors (Figure 1B,
stages 0-1 and 2 vs. stage 4, *P = 0.015 and stage 2 vs.
stage 4, *P = 0.024, respectively). To confirm these
observations, tumor and normal cells were harvested
separately by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from
12 tumor samples (n = 3 for each group); FUCA1 mRNA
expression in the LCM cells was determined by real-time
PCR (Figure 1C). Increased FUCA1 mRNA expression
was preferentially detected in tissue samples from patients
with early-stage disease (Figure 1C; T/N ratio: stage 1 =
191-fold (*P = 0.001 vs. stage 4), stage 2 = 230-fold (*P
= 0.001 vs. stage 4), stage 3 = 35-fold (*P = 0.06 vs. stage
4), and stage 4 = 23-fold).
FUCA1 protein expression was determined by IHC
staining of frozen tumor sections. The results revealed
increased FUCA1 protein expression in premalignant
DCIS (Figure 2A, indicated by a green arrow). In
contrast, lower FUCA1 expression levels were detected
in advanced-stage (stage 4) breast cancers (Figure 2A,
indicated by a red arrow). The clinical status of each
patient was determined to ascertain whether higher
FUCA1 expression in early-stage tumors was important
for clinical/therapeutic outcomes (Table 1). Our results
indicate that higher FUCA1 expression (T > N) was
positively correlated with nodal status and tumor stage

were associated with the risk of death for TNBC patients
(*P = 0.023) but not for non-TNBC patients (Table 2). The
multivariate Cox regression analysis also revealed that a
higher FUCA1 H-score was associated with a significantly
decreased hazard of death for TNBC patients (*P =
0.003). Specifically, a one-unit increase in the FUCA1
H-score was associated with a 0.976-fold decrease in the
risk of death; a ten-unit increase in the FUCA1 H-score
was associated with a 22% decrease in the risk of death.
These results imply that higher FUCA1 H-scores are
associated with better survival outcomes after adjusting
for confounding factors.

in TNBC cells that expressed low FUCA1 levels (MDAMB-231) was used to explore this hypothesis (Figure
3A). FUCA1 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells
was transiently knocked down using siRNA, and cell cycle
was analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 3B). Transient
FUCA inhibition markedly arrested MDA-MB-231 cells
in G0/G1 in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3B, *P =
0.01). To explore the underlying mechanisms responsible
for this effect, we transiently knocked down FUCA1 in
MDA-MB-231 cells and found that the expression of
G1 phase-regulated proteins, such as cyclin D3, cyclin B
and CDK4, were significantly inhibited. In contrast, the
expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as
p21/Cip1 and p27/Kip1, was increased in MDA-MB-231
cells transiently expressing FUCA1 siRNA (Figure 3C).
Although FUCA1 inhibition induced G0/G1
arrest, it failed to cause apoptosis in MDA-MB-231
cells, as revealed by the absence of fragmented DNA
in these cells (Figure 4A, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly,
transient transfecting these cells with the FUCA1-Si
plasmid appeared to result in the loss of cell-cell contact;
cytoplasmic vacuoles also became apparent (Figure
4B, right figure, indicated by a red arrow). A significant
number of autophagic cells was observed by detecting
the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs)
[22], a morphological characteristic of autophagy, by
acridine orange staining (Figure 4C, indicated by the red
arrow). More than 75% of the cells that were transiently
transfected with the FUCA1-siRNA plasmid were
positive for the AVO stain (Figure 4C, *P = 0.001). The
microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is
a widely used marker for monitoring autophagy. One
approach is to detect LC3 conversion (LC3-I to LC3-II) by
immunoblotting because the amount of LC3-II increases
as the number of autophagosomes increases [23]. Next, we
analyzed autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells after transient
transfection with one of two FUCA1-siRNA plasmids (Si1 and Si-2) (Figure 4D). There was a significant increase in
endogenous LC3-II accumulation in both of the transient
FUCA1-siRNA cell lines (Figure 4D). In addition, p62,
or sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), is a common component
of protein aggregates that is responsible for linking
polyubiquitinated proteins to the autophagic machinery
[24]. p62 binds the autophagy regulator Atg8/LC3 through

FUCA1 expression is higher in cancer cells
derived from the original breast tumor site
We further explored the function of FUCA1 in
human cancer cell lines. Interestingly, FUCA1 was
overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in cancer
cells isolated from the original tumor sites (BT-474 and
BT-483). In contrast, FUCA1 protein expression was
lower in cancer cells derived from metastatic sites (AU565, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-453) (Figure
3A). Interestingly, lower FUCA1 protein expression
was detected in TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-453) than in non-TNBC cells (AU-565, BT-483,
BT-474, and MCF-7) (Figure 3A). These results were
consistent with the clinical staging findings (Figure 1C;
Table 1; *P = 0.004) and the inferior overall survival
outcomes (Table 2; H-Score; *P = 0.003) [21].

arrest and autophagic death in MDA-MB-231
cells
Lower FUCA1 expression levels were associated
with advanced-stage tumor formation with inferior
survival outcomes, especially in TNBC patients (Tables
1 and 2; Figure 2D). These results suggested that tumor
cells expressing lower FUCA1 protein levels should
exhibit increased cell surface fucosylation, thereby
enhancing the malignant capabilities of the tumor cells.

into MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells induced autophagic
death. However, our clinical observations indicated that
FUCA1 was expressed at a lower level in advanced-stage
breast cancer cells (Figure 1C, Table 1). These results
suggest that the transient inhibition of FUCA1 in MDAMB-231 cells may produce a selective metastatic pressure
on the primary tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, two

stable FUCA1-knock-down MDA-MB-231 clones
(FUCA1-Si-1 and FUCA1-Si-2) were established for
further analyses (Figure 5A). Cell proliferation assays
were performed; both FUCA1-knock-down MDAMB-231 cell lines exhibited significantly increased cell
proliferation compared with the control cells (Figure 5B,

The two most commonly used anthracyclines in
TNBC therapy are doxorubicin and epirubicin, which are
structural analogs. Epirubicin is commonly used to treat
TNBC and is usually better tolerated than doxorubicin
[27]. Epirubicin can induce autophagy in MDA-MB-231
cells [28]. In vitro studies were performed to determine
whether FUCA inhibition might cause therapeutic
resistance in clinical TNBC patients. Nearly 40% of
epirubicin-treated wild type MDA-MB-231 cells were
viable after 48 h (200 nM epirubicin). However, FUCA1knock-down cells were more resistant to the cytotoxicity
of epirubicin (Figure 5B, right panel, *P = 0.001). These
results suggest that stable FUCA1 inhibition produces a
selective pressure that triggers resistance to epirubicininduced death in MDA-MB-231 cells [28].

migration and invasion compared with wild type or
FUCA-1-Sc-treated control MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure
5C, lanes 3-4 vs. lanes 1-2, *P < 0.001). These results
suggest that FUCA1 may be capable of triggering
metastasis in early-stage TNBC cancer cells.
Several recent studies have demonstrated that breast
cancer epithelial cell migration is influenced by the tumor
microenvironment, which includes stromal cells and the
extracellular matrix (ECM) [29]. Tumor cells adhere to
the ECM via integrin binding; this binding triggers the
phosphorylation of two major integrin-binding proteins,
FAK and Src, which are present at focal adhesions (FA),
leading to FA disassembly and cell migration [30, 31].
To test whether FAK signaling is involved in FUCA1induced cell invasion, the FAK/Src levels in MDAMB-231 cells (Si-1 and Si-2) were examined. The
levels of phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK-Tyr-576) and
phosphorylated Src (p-Src-Tyr-418) were lower in FUCA1
stable knock-down cells (Figure 5D). These results suggest
that FUCA facilitates invasive breast cancer cell migration
and matrix adhesion via the FAK/Src signaling pathway
and that this pathway may represent a potential target for
preventing the metastasis of TNBC breast cancer cells

protein expression was detected in early-stage breast cancer tissues. Transient FUCA1 inhibition significantly arrested MDA-MB-231
cells in G0/G1 and induced autophagic cell death. Then, the cells with minimal levels of FUCA1 expression were selected, and these cells
maintained malignant properties, such as cancer cell growth and metastasis. These effects are similar to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition process by which epithelial cells inhibit cell-cell interactions and reorganize the cytoskeleton to acquire mesenchymal properties
and enable migration to secondary sites.

with highly fucosylated Lewis-x antigens, such as those
detected in advanced-stage breast cancer tissues (Figures
2A and 6). To evaluate whether FUCA1 protein expression
(FUCA H-score) in tumor tissue predicted overall survival,
we used Cox regression proportional hazard analysis.
Interestingly, the univariate Cox regression analysis
revealed that FUCA H-scores were associated with the risk
of death for TNBC patients (*P = 0.023) but not for nonTNBC patients (Table 2). The multivariate Cox regression
analysis also revealed that higher FUCA H-scores
significantly decreased the hazard for death for TNBC
patients (Table 2, *P = 0.003). Therefore, FUCA H-scores
significantly predicted an inferior overall survival rate for
breast cancer patients in the lower expression group (n =
57) compared with the higher expression group (n = 102)
(Figure 2D, *P = 0.009).
High FUCA expression could alter the composition
and decrease the quantity of cell surface fucosylationassociated molecules, thereby limiting the invasiveness of
cancer cells in early-stage breast tumors (Figure 1C and
Table 1). These results suggest that tumor cells expressing
lower FUCA protein levels should exhibit increased cell
surface fucosylation, which would enhance the malignant
potential of the tumor cells. To explore this hypothesis,
FUCA1 was knocked down using siRNA in MDA-MB-231
cells, which express low levels of FUCA1, to create a
cell-based research model [34, 35]. Transient FUCA1
inhibition markedly arrested MDA-MB-231 cells at G0/
G1 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, transient FUCA inhibition
resulted in the loss of cell-cell contact; cytoplasmic AVO
vacuoles, which represent a morphological characteristic
of autophagy, also became apparent [22]. In contrast, we
detected increased proliferation, invasion and migration
in established stable FUCA1 knock-down (Si-1 and Si2) cell lines. These observations indicated that transient
FUCA inhibition in early-stage breast cancer cells may
trigger a selective pressure to generate metastatic primary
tumor cells (Figure 6). Then, cells with minimal FUCA1
expression are selected for the maintenance of malignant
properties, such as growth and metastasis.

DISCUSSION
Alpha-L-fucose is a key monosaccharide that is
overexpressed during breast tumor invasion [1]. FUCA1
catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of terminal alpha-Lfucose residues in glycoproteins and glycolipids that
are associated with the transformation to a malignant
phenotype [1]. Increased fucosylation in breast cancer
cells due to the stable down-regulation of FUCA1 protein
expression (Figure 3) is associated with malignant
transformation, invasion and metastasis. It might be
expected that the enzyme FUCA1, which is involved
in the breakdown of fucose-containing glycoproteins
and glycolipids, would play an important role in
the maintenance of the fucose content of aberrantly
fucosylated glycoconjugates. Similar observations in
patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma have revealed a
significant decrease in FUCA1 activity in malignant tissue
compared with healthy colonic mucosa in the same patient
[15, 16]. These studies indicate that FUCA1 has potential
utility in the diagnosis of breast cancer, particularly at
stages in which the tumor has not yet disseminated [16].
In this study, the over-expression of FUCA1 (Figure 1C)
was detected in early-stage breast cancer tissue from Asian
patients. This phenomenon was also detected in earlystage cancer cells (BT-483 and BT-474) derived from
the original tumor site. In contrast, we detected lower
FUCA1 expression in TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-453) cells derived from metastatic sites (Figure 3A).
We also demonstrated that FUCA1 mRNA expression was
higher in non-smoking patients compared with patients
who smoked (Table 2, *P = 0.037). These results can
be explained by our previous studies that indicated that
smoking-induced breast cancer formation was associated
with clinical outcomes, such as disease stage and 5-year
overall survival [32, 33]. All these observations indicate
that high FUCA1 expression could alter the composition
and decrease the quantity of cell surface fucosylationassociated molecules, thereby limiting the invasiveness of
cancer cells in early-stage breast tumors.
A previous study demonstrated that pretreatment
with FUCA decreased the invasiveness of the highly
invasive/metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer
cell line [2]. The results described above imply that
increased expression of FUCA1, which removes alphaL-fucose from the tumor cell surface, may be a useful
biomarker for early-stage cancer cells at the primary tumor
site (Figures 1C and 3A). For example, Lewis-x antigens
are overexpressed on epithelial cells of various origins,
including breast cancer cells [1, 6]. Increased fucosylation
of Lewis-x antigens by 5 fucosyl-transferases (FUT-3,
-4, -5, -6, and -7) was detected in breast cancer cells that
preferentially metastasized to the bone [20]. In this study,
we found that lower FUCA1 expression was associated

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cell growth and proliferation were determined using
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
(MTT) assay [41]. This assay was repeated four times with
duplicate samples.

RNA interference
FUCA1 expression was ablated in MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells using at least two independent siRNA
clones. Scrambled sequences of each siRNA were used
as controls (Supplementary file 1). After Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis to verify the
absence of significant sequence homology with other
human genes, the selected sequences were inserted into
the pSUPER vector (OligoEngine Co., Seattle, WA,
USA) digested with BglII and HindIII to generate the
pSUPER-FUCA1-Si and pSUPER-scramble vectors. The
sequences of all the constructs were confirmed by DNA
sequencing. The transfection protocol has been described
previously [33]. Briefly, 1.5 × 105 cells were washed twice
with phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with 0.5 μg of
plasmid. One pulse was applied for 20 msec under a fixed
voltage of 1.2 kV on the pipette-type microporator MP100 (Digital Bio, Seoul, Korea).

Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle
MDA-MB-231 cells were synchronized as
previously described [42]. After the cells reached 70-80%
confluency, they were rendered quiescent by incubation
for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing 0.04% fetal calf serum
(FCS) and then challenged with 10% FCS. After the cells
were released using trypsin-EDTA, they were harvested
at various time points, washed twice with PBS/0.1%
dextrose, and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Nuclear
DNA was stained using a reagent containing propidium
iodide (50 µg/mL) and DNase-free RNase (2 U/mL) and
measured using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The
populations of nuclei in each phase of the cell cycle were
determined using the established CellFIT DNA analysis
software (Becton Dickenson, San Jose, CA).

DNA fragmentation was analyzed as previously
described [43]. Briefly, cells were seeded in 100-mm

phenol and then once with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol
(24:1, v:v). DNA was precipitated with 0.1 volumes of

Patient samples
The participants (n = 236) in this study provided
their written informed consent. The study and consent
procedures were approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of Taipei Medical University Hospital. Pairs
of human breast tumor and adjacent normal epithelial
tissues were obtained from anonymous donors according
to a protocol that had been approved by the Institutional
Review Board (TMU-JIRB, No. 201407014). All the
clinical investigations were conducted according to the
principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Histological inspections revealed that all the patient
samples consisted of more than 80% tumor tissue. All
the samples (each paired tumor vs. normal tissue) were
collected and categorized according to their clinical
characteristics.

Cell staining with acridine orange to detect
autophagy
Cell staining with acridine orange (Sigma Chemical
Co.) was performed according to published procedures
[44, 45]. A final concentration of 1 mg/mL acridine
orange was added to the cells for 20 min. Photographs
were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Leica
DMI4000B, Wetzlar Germany) equipped with a 100-W
mercury lamp, a 490-nm band-pass blue excitation filter,
a 500-nm dichroic mirror, and a 515-nm long-pass barrier
filter.

Laser capture microdissection (LCM)
Frozen sections from the breast tumor samples
were prepared for LCM [33]. In this study, we collected
tissues from tumors of different stages (stages 0-4, n =

No. KIT0401; Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA,
USA) were subjected to LCM using a PixCell IIe system
(Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA, USA) [47].
The parameters for LCM included a laser diameter of 8
µm and a laser power of 48–65 mW. A total of 15,000
laser pulse discharges were used for each specimen
to capture ~10,000 morphologically normal epithelial
cells or malignant carcinoma cells for each case. Each
population was visualized under a microscope to ensure
that the captured cells were homogeneous. Then, the caps
with the captured cells were fitted onto 0.5-mL Eppendorf
tubes containing 42 µL of lysis buffer. RNA was isolated
by following the standard protocol of the PicoPure RNA
Isolation Kit (Cat. No. KIT0204; Arcturus Bioscience,

reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR.

Wound healing cell migration assay
MDA-MB-231 cells expressing FUCA1-Si-1,
FUCA1-Si-2, or FUCA1-Sc were seeded into 6-well

pipette tip (1 mm in diameter). The wounded monolayers
were washed several times with PBS to remove cell debris
and were incubated in medium for an additional 24 h. Cell
migration into the wound area and the average number
of migrating cells were determined using an inverted
microscope at various time points.

In vitro invasion assays
In vitro invasion assays were performed using 10mm Transwell chambers that contained Matrigel-coated
polycarbonate membranes with 8-µm pores (Corning
Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) as previously described
[46]. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the FUCA-Si-1,
FUCA1-Si-2 or FUCA1-Sc plasmids were trypsinized and
suspended at a final concentration of 5 x 105 cells/mL in
serum-free L15 medium. The cell suspensions were added
to the upper Transwell chambers. The bottom chambers
contained medium with 5% FBS as a chemoattractant.
After a 24-h incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% air,
all the non-invading cells were removed from the upper

RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA from human breast tumors and
normal tissue samples that had been acquired directly
from patients was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The FUCA1-specific PCR primers were

F-CGCAGAGTTTGCTTGGAC
and R-GGTGGAGAAGAGAAGTTCGT, and the
β-glucuronidase (GUS)-specific primers were synthesized
as
F-AGTGTTCCCTGCTAGAATAGATG
and
R-AAACAGCCCGTTTACTTGAG. A LightCycler
thermocycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim,
Germany) was used for real-time quantitative PCR. The
FUCA1 mRNA fluorescence intensity was measured and
normalized to GUS expression using the built-in software
(Roche LightCycler Version 4) [33].

Antibodies,
immunohistochemistry
microscopic scoring

All the data are expressed as the mean of at least
three experiments with 95% confidence intervals (CIs),
unless otherwise stated. A paired t-test was used to
compare FUCA1 mRNA expression in paired normal
vs. tumor tissues from breast cancer patients. The fold
ratios of FUCA1 mRNA expression in tumors vs. normal
samples were compared using the Mann-Whitney U
test. Pearson correlation coefficient tests were used to
identify associations between FUCA1 protein expression
and clinicopathological variables and Lewis expression
levels. The endpoint was overall survival, which was
calculated from the starting date of surgery to the event
date. The median follow-up was 60 months (range, 2-152
months). Survival analyses were performed using the
Cox proportional hazards model. Survival curves were
plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank
tests were performed to evaluate prognostic differences
between groups for categorical variables. All the statistical
comparisons were performed using SigmaPlot graphing
software (San Jose, CA, USA) and Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences, v. 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
All the statistical tests were two-sided. A p-value of 0.05
or less was considered statistically significant.

The localization of FUCA1 and fucosylated Lewis-x
antigen proteins in breast tumor tissues was detected by
immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded breast tumor
tissues excised from patients were cut into 5-µm slides.
The sections were preincubated in 3% H2O2 and 0.3%
Triton X-100 before microwaving for antigen retrieval.
The sections were microwaved in Tris buffer (pH 6) for
10 min. Then, the sections were blocked in 5% horse
serum (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) for 30 min and
subsequently incubated with antibodies targeting FUCA1
(Cat. No. H00002517-M01, clone 1D4; Abnova) or antifucosylated Lewis-x monoclonal antibody HECA-452
(BD Biosciences, MD, USA) [6, 20] diluted 1:100 for 2
h at room temperature. After incubation with the primary
antibodies, the sections were stained according to the
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method using an LSAB 2
kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Briefly, the sections
were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated
with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Then,
the samples were washed again in the same buffer and
incubated with the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex.
Staining was complete after incubation with the substratechromogen solution. The duration of the incubation in the
DAB solution was determined by low-power microscopic
inspection. Then, the slides were washed, dehydrated and
coverslipped using DPX (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Adjacent sections and slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin for general histological evaluation.
Immunoexpression was scored by two pathologists
(C.H.W. and S.H.T.) using a multi-headed microscope
to obtain a consensus for each sample. Staining was
evaluated based on a combination of both the percentage
and the intensity of the positively stained tumor cells
to generate an H-score, which was calculated using the
