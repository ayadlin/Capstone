ABSTRACT
Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common female cancer and the most
common gynecological malignancy. Although it comprises only ~10% of all
endometrial cancers, the serous histological subtype accounts for ~40% of deaths due
to its aggressive behavior and propensity to metastasize. Histopathological studies
suggest that elevated expression of activin/inhibin βB subunit is associated with
reduced survival in non-endometrioid endometrial cancers (type II, mostly serous).
However, little is known about the specific roles and mechanisms of activin B (βB
dimer) in serous endometrial cancer growth and progression. In the present study, we
examined the biological functions of activin B in type II endometrial cancer cell lines,
HEC-1B and KLE. Our results demonstrate that treatment with activin B increases
cell migration, invasion and adhesion to vitronectin, but does not affect cell viability.
Moreover, we show that activin B treatment increases integrin β3 mRNA and protein
levels via SMAD2/3-SMAD4 signaling. Importantly, siRNA knockdown studies revealed
that integrin β3 is required for basal and activin B-induced cell migration, invasion
and adhesion. Our results suggest that activin B-SMAD2/3-integrin β3 signaling could
contribute to poor patient survival by promoting the invasion and/or metastasis of
type II endometrial cancers.

INTRODUCTION

for extrauterine spread [3, 5]. In The Cancer Genome
Atlas’s recent genomic characterization of endometrial
carcinomas, serous tumors and ~25% of high-grade
endometrioid tumors were grouped in a novel genomic
class (copy-number high, serous-like) characterized
by extensive copy number alterations, frequent TP53
mutations, and poor outcome [6].
Activins are disulfide-linked homodimers of
inhibin β subunits which belong to the transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily [7]. The primary
isoforms of activins are activin A (βAβA), activin AB
(βAβB) and activin B (βBβB). Activins are expressed in
many reproductive tissues, including the endometrium,
where they regulate numerous biological functions in an
autocrine/paracrine manner [8]. In humans, transcripts
encoding inhibin βA and βB subunits as well as activin
receptors have been detected in primary cultures of

Endometrial cancer is the most common, and
second most lethal, gynecological malignancy and the
fourth most common female cancer in North America
[1]. Traditionally, endometrial cancers have been
broadly classified into two clinicopathological types [2].
Accounting for ~70% of endometrial cancers, type I
tumors are primarily comprised of low-grade endometrioid
carcinomas associated with unopposed estrogen and
favorable prognosis. In contrast, type II endometrial
cancers are predominantly non-endometrioid (serous and
clear cell) carcinomas associated with advanced stage and
poor survival [3, 4]. In particular, despite accounting for
only ~10% of all endometrial cancers, serous endometrial
carcinomas account for ~40% of deaths due to their
high grade, deep myometrial invasion and propensity

normal endometrial epithelial and stromal cells [9]. At
the protein level, secreted activin A has been detected in
conditioned medium from normal endometrial epithelial
and stromal cells [9], and immunohistochemical analyses
have confirmed endometrial expression of inhibin βA and
βB subunits throughout the human menstrual cycle [10].
Additionally, increasing evidence suggests that
activins and their receptors may participate, either
positively or negatively, in the development or progression
of a variety of endocrine-related cancers [11]. In
endometrial cancer, early studies demonstrated inhibin β
subunit expression, activin secretion and activin receptor
expression in neoplastic endometrial tissues and/or
endometrial cancer cell lines [9, 12, 13]. Histopathological
studies have since examined the expression of inhibin
βA and βB subunits in sizeable cohorts of endometrial
carcinomas of either endometrioid [14, 15] or nonendometrioid [16] histology. In endometrioid tumors,
positive immunostaining for inhibin βA or βB was
correlated with higher grade, though neither subunit
was associated with overall, progression free or cause
specific survival [14, 15]. In contrast, non-endometrioid
tumors (~70% serous) more frequently displayed positive
immunostaining for inhibin βA or βB [15]; however,
only elevated inhibin βB was associated with reduced
cause specific survival [16]. Interestingly, double
immunofluorescence staining of endometrioid tumors
showed marked co-localization of inhibin α and βA
subunits (suggesting production of inhibin A), whereas
there was minimal co-localization of inhibin α and βB,
suggesting production of activin B [17].
Though histopathological studies suggest activin B
may be linked to poor survival in the most lethal subtype
of endometrial cancer, few studies have examined the
effects of activins on endometrial cancer cells, and all
have examined only the effects of activin A. Early studies
demonstrated both pro- and anti-proliferative effects of
activin A on HEC-50 and ISH endometrial cancer cells,
respectively [13]. However, subsequent studies with
HEC-1, HHUA and Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells
failed to show any effects of activin A on cell proliferation
[12, 18]. In the present study, we examined the effects
of activin B on endometrial cancer cell proliferation,
migration, invasion and adhesion. We show that activin
B does not affect the viability of HEC-1B and KLE type
II endometrial cancer cells. However, our results reveal
an important role for activin B in promoting HEC-1B and
KLE cell migration, invasion and adhesion to vitronectin.
In addition, we show that the effects of activin B on
cell migration, invasion and adhesion to vitronectin are
mediated by the SMAD2/3-SMAD4-dependent upregulation of integrin β3. Our findings suggest that activin
B signaling could promote the invasion and/or metastasis
of type II endometrial cancers, thereby contributing to
poor patient survival.

Activin B increases endometrial cancer cell
migration, invasion and adhesion
In a previous study of 41 non-endometrioid
tumors (29 serous, 7 clear cell and 5 undifferentiated),
positive immunostaining for inhibin βB was observed
in approximately half of the cases and was associated
with reduced cause specific survival (P = 0.026) and
trends towards reduced progression free (P = 0.111) and
overall (P = 0.166) survival [16]. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier
analysis of endometrial cancers with serous histology
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ([6]; n = 53)
shows that samples with inhibin βB mRNA levels greater
than the median are associated with reduced disease free
survival (Log-rank P = 0.021, Supplementary Figure 1A)
and a trend towards reduced overall survival (Log-rank
P = 0.094, Supplementary Figure 1B). Together, these
studies suggest that activin B (βB dimer) signaling could
contribute to poor survival in type II serous endometrial
cancer.
Next, we examined the biological functions of
activin B in two type II endometrial cancer cell lines
(HEC-1B and KLE). Transwell migration and Matrigel
invasion assay results showed that both HEC-1B and
KLE cells exhibited basal levels of cell motility and
invasiveness (Figures 1A and 1B). Importantly, treatment
with 50 ng/mL activin B significantly increased cell
migration and invasion in both cell lines (Figures 1A and
1B). In addition, we examined the effects of activin B on
cell adhesion to different extracellular matrix proteins.
As shown in Figure 1C, HEC-1B cell adhesiveness
was increased in vitronectin-, fibronectin-, Matrigel- or
collagen IV-coated tissue culture plates compared to
uncoated plates. Interestingly, treatment with 50 ng/mL
activin B significantly enhanced the adhesion of HEC1B cells to vitronectin, but did not affect adhesion to the
other extracellular matrix proteins or uncoated plates
(Figure 1C). Similarly, activin B treatment increased the
adhesion of KLE cells to vitronectin (Figure 1C). MTT
assay was used to investigate if the effects of activin B on
HEC-1B and KLE cell migration, invasion and adhesion
could result from changes in cell viability/proliferation.
As shown in Figure 1D, treatment with 50 ng/mL activin
B every 24 h for up to 72 h did not affect HEC-1B or KLE
cell viability.
We also pre-treated HEC-1B and KLE cells with the
inhibitor SB431542 to determine whether activin/TGF-β
type I receptors were required for the biological functions
of activin B. As shown in Figure 2, pre-treatment with
SB431542 completely abolished the effects of activin B
on cell migration, invasion and adhesion to vitronectin.

Activin B up-regulates integrin β3 but not integrin
αv

SMAD2/3-SMAD4 signaling is required for the
up-regulation of integrin β3 by activin B

Given that activin B specifically enhanced
endometrial cancer cell adhesion to vitronectin, we next
examined its effects on the levels of integrin αvβ3, well
known to be a major receptor for vitronectin [19]. As
shown in Figure 3A, treatment with activin B for different
periods of time did not affect the mRNA levels of integrin
αv in HEC-1B or KLE cells. However, activin B treatment
for 3 h significantly up-regulated integrin β3 mRNA levels
and this effect was still observed after 48 h of treatment
(Figure 3A). Western blot analysis was used to confirm
the similar stimulatory effects of activin B on integrin β3
protein levels, and to show that they could be abolished by
pre-treatment with SB431542 (Figure 3B).

To examine the activation of canonical SMAD2/
SMAD3 signaling, HEC-1B and KLE cells were treated
with activin B and Western blot was used to measure the
levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 in relation
to their total levels. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment with
activin B for 30 or 60 min induced the phosphorylation
of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in HEC-1B cells, whereas only
SMAD2 phosphorylation was increased in KLE cells.
Moreover, activin B-induced phosphorylation of SMAD2
and SMAD3 in HEC-1B cells as well as SMAD2 in
KLE cells was blocked by pre-treatment with SB431542
(Figure 4B).
Next, we used pre-treatment with siRNA targeting
common SMAD4 to investigate the involvement of SMAD

As shown in Figure 5A, transfection with SMAD4 siRNA
significantly reduced endogenous SMAD4 mRNA levels
and abolished the up-regulation of integrin β3 mRNA

of activin B on integrin β3 expression in HEC-1B cells.

integrin β3 knockdown suppressed the motility and

knockdown reduced both basal and activin B-induced cell

patterns, receptor/antagonist binding affinities, and
biological functions [21-26]. Indeed, inhibin βA (Inhba)
and βB (Inhbb) subunit knockout mice exhibit different
phenotypes, and the defects observed in Inhba knockout
mice are only partially restored by insertion of Inhbb [27,
28]. On the other hand, we have recently demonstrated
that recombinant activin A, B and AB have similar
effects on human ovarian granulosa cell steroidogenesis
and placental trophoblast cell invasion [29, 30]. Taken

together, these studies suggest that activin A and B could
function distinctly or similarly depending on the cellular
context. Our results showing that activin B does not affect
endometrial cancer cell viability are in agreement with
previous studies examining the proliferative effects of
activin A [12, 18]. However, we cannot definitively rule
out potential effects of activin B on cell proliferation due
to the low proliferative rates of HEC-1B and KLE cells
and the limited time-course of our studies. Indeed, activin

A has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of estrogenresponsive ISH endometrial cancer cells, whereas it
enhanced the proliferation of estrogen-insensitive HEC50 endometrial cancer cells [13]. Interestingly, treatment
with estradiol abolished the suppressive effects of activin
A on ISH cell proliferation, whereas it had no impact on
the effects of activin A in HEC50 cells [13]. These results
suggest that the effects of activins could be modified by
other hormones or paracrine factors, perhaps differentially
depending on the activin isoform or type I vs. type II
carcinomas. In renal cancer cells, treatment with activin
B had no effect on proliferation in vitro, however inhibin
βB subunit knockdown cells formed smaller tumors
in xenograft studies [31]. Conversely, activins could
differentially modulate the effects of other hormones or
paracrine factors. For example, activin A has been shown
to reduce the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β on
endometrial cancer cell proliferation [18]. Future studies
will be required to fully characterize the specific roles and
molecular determinants of activin A and B in endometrial
cancer cell proliferation.
Commonly confined to the uterus, type I endometrial
cancers can often be treated by hysterectomy and have
good prognosis. In contrast, the most prevalent type
II endometrial cancer, serous endometrial carcinoma,
has a relapse rate as high as 50% [32] and accounts for
40% of all endometrial cancer related deaths [5]. This
lethality is largely due to its propensity for deep invasion
and metastatic spread, thus understanding the molecular
mechanisms mediating these processes could lead to new
therapeutic approaches for type II endometrial cancers.
We now demonstrate, for the first time, that treatment
with activin B increases type II endometrial cancer cell
migration, invasion and adhesion to vitronectin. To date,
only a few studies have examined the effects of activin B
on cancer cell motility or adhesion. In renal cancer cells,
activin B has been shown to increase cell adhesion and
invasion [31, 33], however the molecular mechanisms
underlying these effects remain unclear. Together with
previous histopathological studies, our results suggest
that antagonizing activin B signaling could be a novel
approach to the treatment of type II endometrial cancer.
However, only a few therapeutic agents targeting
the activin system have entered clinical trials (www.
clinicaltrials.gov), and none of them are entirely specific
for activin signaling [34]. LY-2157299 (Galunisertib)
is a small-molecule inhibitor of activin/TGF-β type I
receptors (related to SB431542) which is currently under
phase 1/2 investigation in hepatocellular, pancreatic
and glial cancers. Sotatercept (ACE-011) is an activin
receptor type IIA (ACVR2A) Fc fusion protein which is
currently under phase 1/2 investigation for the treatment
of cancer-associated anemia. Interestingly, an ACVR2B
Fc fusion protein (STM 434) has entered phase 1 studies
in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in patients
with ovarian cancer or other advanced tumors, including
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

endometrial cancer (NCT02262455).
Our results show that treatment of endometrial
cancer cells with activin B up-regulates integrin β3 mRNA
and protein levels without altering the expression of
integrin αv. Integrin β3 forms only two α-β heterodimers,
αvβ3 and αIIbβ3, both of which are receptors for
vitronectin [35]. However, integrin αIIb mRNA levels are
nearly undetectable in HEC-1B and KLE cells, whereas
the mRNA levels of integrin αv are at least 10 times
higher than those of integrin β3 (data not shown). Thus,
our results showing that knockdown of integrin β3 reduced
both basal and activin B-induced cell migration, invasion
and adhesion to vitronectin likely indicate that these
effects are mediated by integrin αvβ3. Integrin αvβ3 is
expressed in many types of cancer where it plays important
roles in promoting angiogenesis and cancer cell adhesion,
migration and invasion [36-42]. Though studies have
shown that integrin αvβ3 is expressed in endometrioid
and serous endometrial cancers [43, 44], its clinical and/or
therapeutic relevance in these tumors has yet to be defined.
Molecular therapies targeting αvβ3 have achieved positive
results such as disease stabilization in advanced solid
tumors [45, 46], as well as extended survival in high grade
glioma [47, 48]. Interestingly, primary serous endometrial
cancer cell migration and adhesion to vitronectin were
reduced following treatment with inhibitory anti-integrin
αv antibody [44]. However, endometrial cancers have also
been shown to express integrin αvβ5 and αvβ6 [44, 49],
though their functional roles are unknown. Regardless,
our study demonstrates that integrin β3 (likely αvβ3) may
constitute a novel therapeutic target in type II endometrial
cancers by virtue of its ability to promote basal and activin
B-induced cell adhesion, migration and invasion.
Apart from integrin-mediated cell-matrix contact,
the metastatic capacity of tumors is also governed by
cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion [50]. In particular,
cancer cell metastasis is often associated with epithelialmesenchymal transition which is characterized by the
down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of
N-cadherin [51]. Increasing evidence suggests that
endometrial cancers display a number of features
associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
process [52]. Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated
that activin B can stimulate human trophoblast cell
invasion by up-regulating N-cadherin expression [30].
Whether modulation of E-cadherin or N-cadherin
contributes to activin B-induced cell migration and
invasion in endometrial cancer remains unknown and
warrants further investigation.
Previous studies have shown that the expression of
integrin β3 in endometrial cancer cells can be regulated
by progesterone [53], macrophage migration inhibitory
factor [54], and gonadotropin-releasing hormone [55].
Similar to our results for activin B in endometrial cancer
cells, TGF-β1 has been shown to up-regulate integrin
β3 in glioma cells [56], lung fibroblasts [57], and breast

cancer cells [58], whereas it down-regulated integrin β3
in lymphoma cells [59]. Interestingly, our results show
that while activin B activated both SMAD2 and SMAD3
in HEC-1B cells, only SMAD2 was activated in KLE
cells. At present, we do not know why activin B failed
to increase the levels of phosphorylated SMAD3 in KLE
cells. However, it has previously been reported that TGF-β
isoforms can induce SMAD3 phosphorylation in KLE
cells [60], thus it does not appear to be a general defect
in SMAD3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, depletion of
SMAD3 abolished the stimulatory effects of activin B
on integrin β3 expression in KLE cells, suggesting that
SMAD3 phosphorylation is not required or endogenous
levels of SMAD3 phosphorylation are sufficient for activin
B-induced integrin β3 expression. Regardless, our siRNA
results demonstrate that neither SMAD can compensate
for the loss of the other, suggesting both SMAD2 and
SMAD3 are required for the up-regulation of integrin
β3 by activin B. Interestingly, knockdown of SMAD3
in lung fibroblasts did not alter TGF-β1-induced integrin
β3 production, whereas it attenuated the up-regulation of
integrin β5 [57]. Instead, c-Src and p38 MAPK signaling
were required for the up-regulation of integrin β3 by
TGF-β1 [57]. Future studies will be required to clarify
how SMAD-dependent and -independent signaling is
integrated at the level of the ITGB3 promoter.
In summary, our results show that activin B
stimulates the migration, invasion and adhesion of type
II endometrial cancer cells. Moreover, these effects are
mediated by the up-regulation of integrin β3 production
in a SMAD2/3-SMAD4-dependent manner. Our study
identifies novel molecular mechanisms that may contribute
to the invasion and/or metastasis of type II endometrial
cancers.

MTT
(3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma) assay was used to
determine cell viability. Cells were seeded one day prior
to treatment in 24-well plates (1x104/well) with 500 μL
of medium and then treated with activin B every 24 h for
up to 72 h. MTT (final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL) was
added at each time point and incubated for 4 h prior to
removing the medium and adding DMSO to dissolve the
crystals. Absorbances were measured at 490 nm using a
microplate spectrophotometer.

Transwell migration and invasion assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Migration and invasion assays were performed in
Boyden chambers with minor modifications [62]. Cell
culture inserts (24-well, pore size 8 μm; BD Biosciences,
Mississauga, ON) were seeded with 1x105 cells in 250
μL of medium with 0.1% FBS. Un-coated inserts were
used for migration assays whereas inserts pre-coated with
growth factor reduced Matrigel (40 μL, 1 mg/mL; BD
Biosciences) were used for invasion assays. Medium with
10% FBS (750 μL) was added to the lower chamber and
served as a chemotactic agent. After incubation for 24 h
(migration) or 48 h (invasion), non-migrating/invading
cells were wiped from the upper side of the membrane and
cells on the lower side were fixed in cold methanol and air
dried. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 and
counted using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescent microscope
equipped with a digital camera (QImaging, Surrey, BC).
Each individual experiment had triplicate inserts and five
microscopic fields (obtained from middle, upper, lower,
right and left parts of membrane) were counted per insert

Cell culture
HEC1B and KLE type II human endometrial
cancer cell lines were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) [61]. HEC-1B
cells were cultured in Minimal Essential Medium (Gibco,
Life Technologies, Burlington, ON) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories
Inc., Logan, UT). KLE cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (Gibco,
Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories Inc.). Cultures were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 in air.

Adhesion assays

Cells were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling Technology) with added protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Extracts were centrifuged
at 20,000×g for 10 min at 4°C and supernatant protein
concentrations were determined using the DC Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Equal amounts of protein
(50 µg) were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes.
After blocking for 1 h with 5% non-fat dry milk in Trisbuffered saline (TBS), the membranes were incubated
overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies that were diluted
1000-fold in 5% non-fat milk-TBS. Following primary
antibody incubation, the membranes were incubated with
the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced
chemiluminescent substrate or SuperSignal West Femto
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) and X-ray
film. Membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1%
SDS) at 50°C for 30 min and reprobed with anti-α-tubulin
antibody. Densitometric quantification was performed
using Scion Image software (Scion Corp, Frederick, MD)
with α-tubulin as the internal control for normalization.

96-well plates were coated overnight at 4°C
with vitronectin (1 μg/cm2; R&D Systems), fibronectin
(10 μg/cm2; R&D Systems), Matrigel (5 μg/cm2; BD
Biosicences) or collagen IV (10 μg/cm2; R&D Systems)
and then blocked for 1 h with 0.5% bovine serum albumin.
Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well and
incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h. Non-adherent cells were
removed by washing with PBS, and adherent cells were
fixed with cold methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal
violet for 25 min at room temperature. After removing
the crystal violet solution, the stained cells were washed
with water and 10% acetic acid was added to dissolve
the crystal violet. Absorbances were measured at 590 nm
using a microplate spectrophotometer.

Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR
(RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Burlington, ON) in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse
transcription was performed with 2 µg RNA, random
primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega,
Madison, WI). The primers used for SYBR Green RTqPCR were: integrin β3, 5′-GAA GGC TGG CAG
GCA TTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAT GAT TGT CAC
TAC CAA CAT GAC ACT-3′ (reverse); integrin αv, 5′TGC CCA GCG CGT CTT C-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGG
GTG GTG TTT GCT TTG G-3′ (reverse); SMAD2, 5′GCC TTT ACA GCT TCT CTG AAC AA-3′ (forward)
and 5′-ATG TGG CAA TCC TTT TCG AT-3′ (reverse);
SMAD3, 5′-CCC CAG CAC ATA ATA ACT TGG-3′
(forward) and 5′-AGG AGA TGG AGC ACC AGA AG-3′
(reverse); SMAD4, 5′-TGG CCC AGG ATC AGT AGG
T-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAT CAA CAC CAA TTC CAG
CA-3′ (reverse) and GAPDH, 5′-GAG TCA ACG GAT
TTG GTC GT-3′ (forward) and 5′- GAC AAG CTT CCC
GTT CTC AG-3′ (reverse). RT-qPCR was performed
using an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR
System equipped with 96-well optical reaction plates.
The specificity of each assay was validated by melting
curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR
products. Assay performance was validated by assessing
amplification efficiencies by means of calibration curves,
and ensuring that the plot of log input amount versus ∆Cq
has a slope < |0.1|. At least three separate experiments
were performed and each sample was assayed in
triplicate. A mean value of the triplicates was used for the
determination of relative mRNA levels by the comparative
Cq method with GAPDH as the reference gene and using
the formula 2-∆∆Cq.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection
To knock down endogenous integrin β3, SMAD2,
SMAD3 and SMAD4, forty percent confluent cells
were transfected for 48 h with 20 nM ON-TARGETplus
SMART pool siRNA targeting human integrin β3,
SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 (Dharmacon, Lafayette,
CO) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies). ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting pool
siRNA (Dharmacon) was used as the control.

Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the mean ± SEM of at least
three independent experiments. For experiments involving
only two groups, results were analyzed by Two-Sample
t-test assuming unequal variances using Excel. Multiple
group comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA
followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test using PRISM
software (GraphPad Software). Means were considered
significantly different if P < 0.05 and are indicated by
different letters.
