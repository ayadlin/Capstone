BACKGROUND: Irinotecan has significant activity in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The authors’ previous phase 1
study of alternating weekly therapy with irinotecan/cisplatin (IP), etoposide/cisplatin (EP), and granulocyte–colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) support was well tolerated and active in patients with SCLC. A phase 2 trial was conducted to estimate the efficacy of this regimen in previously untreated patients with extensive SCLC. METHODS: A
total of 33 patients were treated between June 2002 and July 2007. Patients received 12 weeks of therapy with cisplatin (20 mg/m2) on Day 1 and irinotecan (100 mg/m2) on Day 1 and G-CSF on Days 2 to 5 (Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and
11) followed by cisplatin (20 mg/m2) on Day 1 and etoposide (60 mg/m2) on Days 1 to 3 with G-CSF on Days 4 to 7
(Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). The primary endpoint was 1-year survival rate. RESULTS: Grade 4 neutropenia (toxicities
were determined using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) was noted in 5 (1.5%) of
343 courses with neutropenic fever in only 5 (1%) of 343 courses. One patient died of neutropenic sepsis. Nonhematologic toxicities grade 2 were observed in 15 (4%) of 343 courses and were limited to fatigue, hyponatremia, and
diarrhea. The overall objective response rate was 89% in 28 assessable patients (no complete responses and 25 partial responses). The median progression-free and overall survivals were 6.0 months and 10.9 months, respectively. The
1-year survival rate was 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly therapy with IP alternating with EP and G-CSF support was
well tolerated in patients with extensive SCLC, but did not demonstrate improved progression-free or overall survival

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 13% of total lung cancer cases in the United States, with the number of cases

for 2008 estimated at 28,000.1 The majority of patients with SCLC present with extensive disease (ED), defined as tumor
that extends beyond the ipsilateral lung and regional lymph nodes.2 Combination chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin has been a standard treatment for the past 20 years.3-6 Despite high initial response rates and
improved survival with combination chemotherapy, therapy for ED-SCLC is characterized by early recurrence and failure
of second-line therapy to produce meaningful response rates or long survival times.6 Strategies to improve initial tumor
kill have included rapid alternation of noncross-resistant regimens, increased dose density, and addition of a third drug to
the etoposide/platin base.7 In general, these strategies have failed and the median survival in patients with ED-SCLC continues to be 8 months to 10 months, despite intensive investigation over the past 25 years.8,9
Irinotecan, a camptothecin analogue that inhibits topoisomerase I, has demonstrated significant antitumor activity
in SCLC and may be synergistic with topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as etoposide.10-12 Topoisomerase I inhibitors have

also been shown to be synergistic with cisplatin, perhaps
by inhibiting repair of DNA damage.13 In addition, cells
resistant to topoisomerase inhibitors have been shown to
have a marked increase in cisplatin sensitivity.12 Preclinical studies indicate that resistance to drugs that target
topoisomerase II may be mediated by a decrease in topoisomerase II levels. This finding has been associated with
an increase in topoisomerase I levels, as well as an
increased sensitivity to topoisomerase I inhibitors.11,14
The converse order of exposure has also been investigated.
In xenograft studies, pretreatment with irinotecan potentiated the cytotoxic effects of the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin.15 In a lung cancer cell line, maximum
synergy was achieved when topotecan preceded etoposide.16 In a phase 1 study evaluating topoisomerase targeting with irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) followed by
etoposide in patients with advanced malignancy, the best
response was noted in patients with increased topoisomerase II a at the time of etoposide administration.17 The
concurrent administration of topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II inhibitors has been shown to be antagonistic
in vitro.12
In 2000, Noda et al reported the results of the Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) Study 9511.18
This phase 3 trial, which randomized patients with EDSCLC to receive IP or etoposide and cisplatin (EP), demonstrated a 3.4-month improvement in median survival
for patients on the irinotecan arm.19 Based on those
promising results and the preclinical data supporting sequential exposure to topoisomerase inhibitors, we conducted a phase 1 study of alternating weekly therapy with
IP and EP, supported with granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in patients with untreated SCLC.
This regimen was active and well- tolerated.20 We sought
to determine the efficacy of this regimen in a subsequent
phase 2 trial for patients with ED-SCLC described herein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically
documented SCLC and ED, defined as disease beyond
the hemithorax of origin and regional lymph nodes and
demonstrated by staging that included chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and abdomen, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and
radionuclide bone scan. Patients with cytologically positive pleural effusion as the only evidence of ED were eligible, as were patients with clinically silent brain metastases;

adequate organ function, including absolute granulocytes
1500 lL, platelet count 100,000 lL, bilirubin 1.5
mg/dL, and creatinine clearance >59 mL/minute; Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2; no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy
for SCLC; and no recent (<5 years) history of malignancy
other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma
of the bladder/cervix. Pregnant or lactating patients and
patients with acute uncontrolled infection or severe
comorbid conditions were excluded. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and all
patients were treated at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
All patients were required to sign a written informed consent form before participation in the study.
Therapy
Weekly chemotherapy was comprised of IP (cisplatin at a
dose of 20 mg/m2 intravenously [iv], irinotecan at a dose
of 100 mg/m2 iv on Day 1, and filgrastrim at a dose of 5
mg/kg subcutaneously on Days 2-5) alternating with EP
(cisplatin at a dose of 20 mg/m2 iv on Day 1, etoposide at
a dose of 60 mg/m2 iv on Days 1-3, and filgrastrim at a
dose of 5 mg/kg subcutaneously on Days 4-7). Patients
received 12 cycles of therapy, with IP on odd–numbered
weeks (6 cycles) and EP on even–numbered weeks (6
cycles). Weekly chemotherapy was delayed for 1 week if
the patient had an absolute neutrophil count <1200 cells/
lL or a platelet count <100,000 cells/lL on Day 1 of
planned treatment. If patients experienced anemia with
hemoglobin <10 g/dL, erythropoietin was started at
40,000 IU subcutaneously each week. Chemotherapy was
also withheld until nonhematologic toxic effects had
resolved to grade 1 or less. Irinotecan was reduced by 1
dose level (ie, to 90 mg/m2 iv on Day 1) after the first incidence of neutropenic fever, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or
grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxic effects, excluding nausea and vomiting. A second irinotecan dose reduction (ie,
to 80 mg/m2 iv on Day 1) was allowed in the event of
reoccurrence of the aforementioned toxicities. The cisplatin dose was reduced by 50% in patients with an estimated
creatinine clearance of 40 to 59 mL/min, and cisplatin
was withheld in those with a creatinine clearance of <40
mL/min. Complete blood counts with differential and
serum chemical assays were performed weekly.
Patients with brain metastases who developed progressive disease at any time, or who did not demonstrate a
complete or partial response in the brain on MRI during
Week 7 were removed from the study and referred for

Week 7 continued chemotherapy and were referred for
brain radiation at the time of completion of systemic
treatment.

Study Design and Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint for this phase 2 trial was
defined as the 1-year survival rate, targeting an
improvement from our estimated institutional historical control rate of 40% to 55%. Secondary endpoints
included progression-free survival, response rates, and
toxicity. Responses were assessed by chest x-ray during
Weeks 4 and 7, and after treatment (Week 13) and
by re-imaging all involved sites (with a CT scan or
MRI) during Week 13, or earlier as clinically indicated. All patients treated were evaluable for both toxicity and survival. Patients who completed 6 weeks of
treatment and had restaging were evaluable for
response. Patients who died during therapy or were
lost to follow-up were counted as having progressive
disease as of the date of death unless there was definite clinical or autopsy diagnosis of drug-related death
or death due to a nonrelated cause. The designation
of a complete or partial response or stable or progressive disease was based on standard World Health
Organization criteria,21 preferably using the CT scan
and/or MRI obtained at Week 13. After completing
therapy, patients were evaluated every 3 months or
more frequently as clinically indicated. Toxicities were
computed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).
Survival was measured from the first day of treatment and estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.22 Progression-free survival was calculated from the first day of
treatment until disease progression or death.

RESULTS
Patients
Between June 2002 and July 2007, 33 patients were
accrued onto this study. Patient characteristics are
described in Table 1. The patients represent a relatively good prognostic group based on their performance status (97% ECOG 0-1) and frequency of
oligometastatic disease (52%). Two patients had pleural disease as their only manifestation of ED, and 2
patients had extrathoracic lymphadenopathy as their
only manifestation of ED.

Treatment Delivery and Response
Twenty-six patients (79%) completed the planned 12
cycles of chemotherapy (range, 2-12 cycles), with 90% of
the planned dose intensity of irinotecan delivered.
Five patients were not assessable for response: 1
patient received 3 courses and refused further treatment at
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,
1 patient died of neutropenic sepsis after 2 weeks of therapy, 1 patient developed a hypersensitivity reaction to etoposide and 1 patient had grade 3 diarrhea (both were
taken off the study after 5 weeks); and 1 patient withdrew
consent due to toxicities that did not meet protocol criteria for discontinuation after 5 weeks. The overall response
rate was 89% (25 of 28 evaluable patients), with no
patients achieving a complete response and 25 (89%)
achieving a partial response. Six patients with a partial
response had sclerotic lesions in bone as the only site of residual disease after chemotherapy. Progression-free survival in these 6 patients was 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, and 77þ
months. Two of these patients survived >2 years (1 was
still alive and free of disease at the time of last follow-up,
after 6.4 years).
Survival
Three patients remained alive at the time of analysis, with
a median follow-up of 46.5 months in survivors. The

2411

Original Article

estimation of median progression-free and overall survival
durations for the entire population was 6.0 months (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 5.0-7.6 months) and 10.9
months (95% CI, 8.5-18.4 months), respectively (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. (Top) Progression-free survival and (Bottom) overall
survival are shown. Dotted lines indicate 95% confidence
intervals.

The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 33%
(95% CI, 0.21%-0.54%) and 24% (95% CI, 0.13%0.44%) for the entire group, respectively.
Five patients (15%, all females) survived >3 years
(3.1 þ, 3.7, 4.0, 5.3 þ, and 6.4 þ years). At presentation,
2 of these patients had 1 isolated metastatic lesion outside
of the chest (femur in 1 patient and a single intra-abdominal lymph node in 1 patient), 2 patients had multiple
bone lesions as the only site of disease, and 1 patient had
extrathoracic metastases to the liver and kidneys. Disease
in 2 of these 5 patients recurred after first-line chemotherapy (progression-free survivals of 9 months and 11
months, respectively): 1 patient had locoregional disease
recurrence only, and was salvaged by chemoradiotherapy
to the chest, but subsequently died of acute myeloid leukemia; 1 patient had indolent recurrences, first in the
brain, then in the adrenal gland, and eventually further
systemic disease progression. Three patients were still alive
and free of disease at the time of last follow–up.
Toxicity
Neutropenia and neutropenic fever were uncommon,
with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia reported in 14 patients and
5% of courses, and grade 3 to 4 febrile neutropenia
reported in 5 patients and 1% of courses. Grade 3 to 4
nonhematologic toxicities included diarrhea, hyponatremia, and dehydration. There was 1 therapy-related death
due to sepsis (Table 2). One other patient developed acute
myeloid leukemia 3.2 years after enrollment onto the
study that was believed to be related to therapy.

DISCUSSION
Alternating weekly therapy with EP and IP supported by
prophylactic G-CSF was found to be feasible and well tolerated. Grade 4 neutropenia and neutropenic fever were
uncommon, as would be expected with the use of prophylactic G-CSF. Despite this, 1 patient died of neutropenic
sepsis. This regimen was highly active in patients with
untreated, extensive SCLC. However, the high response
rates (89%), failure-free survival (6 months), and median
survival (11 months) times were similar to results
obtained in previous phase 2 trials conducted at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center; our previous experience with cisplatin and etoposide combined
with either ifosfamide,23 interferon-a-2a,24 or paclitaxel25
featured response rates of 89% to 93%; median overall
survival times of 11 to 12 months; and 2-year survival
rates of 9%, 6%, and10%, respectively. Whereas the 2year survival rate of the current trial (24%) is more than
2-fold higher than previously observed by our group,23-25
this finding most likely reflects patients’ prognostic characteristics rather than the activity of the regimen, because
the majority of long-term survivors had metastatic disease
to only 1 site or organ/system.26,27 The potential benefit
of this regimen in a small subset of patients, however, cannot be excluded. This benefit is suggested by the nature of
the metastatic disease in patients surviving >3 years.
After presentation of the results of JCOG 9511,19
many groups hypothesized that integration of irinotecan
to frontline regimens in ED-SCLC would improve outcomes for this patient population, and phase 1 and 2 studies were launched to explore the activity of cisplatin,
etoposide, and irinotecan both in white,29 and Asian30-32
patients, including the trial reported herein. However,
during/after the conduct of these studies, the results of 3
other phase 3 trials were presented, which suggested that
the activity of irinotecan in white patients might not be as
high as initially observed in the Japanese population. In 2
North American studies, Hanna et al and Lara et al
showed equivalent efficacy for IP compared with EP.33,34
The IRIS trial, from Scandinavia, compared carboplatin
combined with either oral etoposide or irinotecan, in an
every-3-week schedule. There was a 1.4-month improvement in the median survival time for patients on the irinotecan arm (7.1 months vs 8.5 months; P ¼ .02).35 An
imbalance in elderly patients on the etoposide arm and
the automatic dose reduction instituted for them may
explain these results. Taken together, these data suggest
that the positive results with irinotecan reported in JCOG
9511 appear to be relevant only for the Japanese populaCancer

tion, and that the use of irinotecan in white patients might
not be as beneficial as initially postulated, thus partially
contributing to the lack of improvement in survival noted
in our trial compared with historical controls.
Other investigators have evaluated variations of the
cisplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan triplet regimen, as
detailed in Table 3. These trials either used an alternating
weekly schedule,31,32 or integrated irinotecan to EP in
21-day or 28-day cycles.28-30 In Japanese patients, Sekine
at al observed an overall response rate of 91% and a median overall survival of 11.9 months with the alternating
weekly schedule in a phase 1/2 study.32 This prompted
evaluation of the regimen in the setting of a randomized
phase 2 trial: alternating EP and IP was compared with
cisplatin (60 mg/m2 iv on Day 1), etoposide (50 mg/m2 iv
on Days 1-3), and irinotecan (60 mg/m2 iv on Days 1, 8,
and 15) every 28 days.31 The 28-day cycle schedule outperformed the alternating weekly schedule, with a median
overall survival of 12.9 versus 8.9 months, respectively.
Because the Day 15 irinotecan dose was frequently omitted due to toxicity, a modified regimen of cisplatin on
Day 1, etoposide on Days 1 to 3, and irinotecan on Days
1 and 8 every 21 days was selected as the experimental
arm for the follow-up randomized phase 2 study, whereas
the control arm was comprised of cisplatin (60 mg/m2 iv
on Day 1) and irinotecan (60 mg/m2 iv on Days 1 and 8)
every 21 days. In this follow-up study, a modest increase
in median overall survival was observed for the triplet regimen compared with the doublet (13.7 months vs 12.4
months, respectively); however, despite G-CSF support,
the 3-drug combination was still too toxic to warrant further evaluation.30
In white patients, a phase 2 trial from Greece examined the administration of cisplatin (20 mg/m2) and etoposide (75 mg/m2) iv on Days 1, 2, and 3 combined with
irinotecan (120 mg/m2) on Day 2, every 21 days. The regimen had a good safety profile, a relative dose intensity of
irinotecan of 90%, and the median overall survival was
15.1 months,28 which compares favorably with the Japanese data and the data from our current study. This finding raises the question whether, when integrated to/
intercalated with etoposide-based regimens, a full, single
dose of irinotecan should be delivered in close proximity
to etoposide, to fully take advantage of the potential additive effects of sequentially inhibiting topoisomerase I and
II. In support of this hypothesis, Whitacre et al demonstrated in animal models that inhibition of topoisomerase
I by topotecan resulted in a compensatory increase in topoisomerase II levels and that this increase was associated

with increased sensitivity of tumors to subsequent treatment with etoposide. However, after 5 days of the last
dose of topotecan, topoisomerase II levels declined, leading to restoration of the original response of the xenografts
to etoposide.16 A study by Gupta et al in humans also
indicated a rise in topoisomerase II levels with daily oral
irinotecan treatment for 14 days in surrogate tissues (peripheral blood mononuclear cells); the peak topoisomerase II levels occurred at Days 4, 7, and 17, but levels
returned to baseline at Day 18 (ie, 4 days after discontinuation of irinotecan).36 Thus, these studies indicate that,
by delaying etoposide administration for 7 days after exposure to irinotecan in our study, we could have missed
the window during which topoisomerase II levels in tumor cells were highest and, possibly, most sensitive to
etoposide.
In conclusion, the results of this phase 2 study
suggest that alternating weekly therapy with IP and
EP with routine growth factor support, although
active and well tolerated, does not significantly
improve outcomes for patients with untreated extensive SCLC compared with historical controls at our
institution. Overall, the clinical data regarding the
value of irinotecan in front-line therapy for North
American patients with SCLC does not support a

2414

benefit, either as a substitute for etoposide in a doublet with cisplatin, or added to an EP base.
