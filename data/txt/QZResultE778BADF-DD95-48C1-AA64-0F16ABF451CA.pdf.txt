ABSTRACT
Natural killer (NK) cell-based treatments are promising therapies for multiple
myeloma (MM). Carfilzomib (CFZ), is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, used
to treat relapsed and refractory MM. In this study, we determined that CFZ treatment
enhanced the sensitivity of MM cells to NK cell-mediated lysis. Here, we report that
CFZ decreased the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I in a time- and
dose- dependent manner. CFZ also down-regulated the expression of newly formed
HLA class I on MM cells. Treatment of MM with CFZ enhanced NK cell degranulation and
significantly sensitized patients’ MM cells to NK cell-mediated lysis. Furthermore, the
enhancement of NK cell-mediated lysis was linked with the decreased expression of HLA
class I. Our findings show a novel activity of CFZ as an immunomodulating agent and
suggest a possible approach to therapeutically augment NK cell function in MM patients.

receptor (KIR) and self HLA class I render NK cells
tolerant to self, a process known as “NK cell licensing”.
So mature NK cells will not attack healthy cells [9].
Down-regulation of the expression of HLA class I on
tumor cells helps them escape immune surveillance.
However, according to the “missing self-hypothesis”,
lack of normal expression of HLA class I will activate
NK cells, so they can recognize and lyse HLA class I
defective tumor cells [10].
HLA class I expressed on the cell surface consist
of two polypeptide chains: a heavy chain (α chain) and
a light chain (β2M), and an additional peptide of 8 to
10 amino acids in length [11]. Binding to the peptide is
a requirement for class I assembly in the endoplasmic
reticulum [12]. Stabilization of the HLA class I complex
on the cell surface results from this peptide binding [13].
The human T2 cell line, that has a defect in transporting
peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum,
was reported to be HLA class I assembly deficient
[14]. Proteasome is believed to be the cytosolic factor
responsible for peptide generation [15]. Proteasome
inhibitor can block the assembly of HLA class I by
inhibiting the peptide production [16].

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disorder
characterized by uncontrolled monoclonal plasma cell
proliferation [1]. It accounts for 10% of all hematological
malignancies and causes 15–20% of deaths from
hematological malignancies. Although new therapies were
introduced and overall survival of MM was improved in
the last 10 years, MM still remains an incurable disease
due to drug resistance [2, 3].
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT)
improves long-term survival in MM patients [4], but
Allo-SCT in MM is still a controversial treatment
[5]. The human natural killer (NK) cell role in killing
tumor cells is suggested by the effects of Allo-SCT,
when the grafted NK inhibitory receptors mismatch
with recipient HLA molecules [6]. NK cells are a
subpopulation of lymphocytes that play an important
role in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity [7].
NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is enhanced or blocked
by a balance between activating and inhibitory signals
sent by membrane receptors [8]. The interactions

Carfilzomib (CFZ), a selective proteasome
inhibitor, is used to treat patients with MM who
are refractory or intolerant to both bortezomib and
lenalidomide (or thalidomide) [17]. CFZ irreversibly
inhibits 26S proteasome binding, causing sustained
proteasome inhibition [18]. We hypothesized that
CFZ, a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, could
decrease the expression of HLA class I on MM cells.
We also investigated whether CFZ treatment of MM
cells could enhance the lysis mediated by NK cells, thus
linking this process with the down-regulation of HLA
expression. Herein, we show a novel activity of CFZ as
an immunomodulator, and suggest its use as a possible
drug therapeutic approach to combine with NK cell-based
therapies for MM.

HLA-C and HLA class I remained almost unchanged in
the presence of the peptides and Human β2M cocultured
with the CFZ treated H929 cells (Supplementary Figure
S2). The peptides had no effect on the HLA-C and HLA
class I expression levels in the untreated H929 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2). These data indicate that
exogenous HLA-C binding peptides can stabilize HLA-C
expression on the cell surface during CFZ treatment.
We also determined the expression levels of other
NK cell ligands on H929 cells after CFZ treatment, as
shown in Figure 3A, CFZ could up-regulate the expression
of DR4 and DR5, but had no effect on the ligands of
NKG2D (MIC A/B, ULBP 1–3) and ligands of NCRs
(NKp30-L, NKp44-L and NKp46-L).

CFZ decreases the amount of newly formed HLA
class I on the MM cell surface

RESULTS

We have shown the down-regulation of HLA class
I expression on MM cells after CFZ treatment. We next
used acid stripping, which proved to selectively measure
the surface expression of newly formed class I complex,
to investigate whether CFZ had an effect on the generation
of new HLA class I. H929 cells were exposed to glycine
(pH = 2.5) to remove surface HLA class I, and then
allowed to re-express newly generated class I in the
presence or absence of 10 nM CFZ for 12 hours. The
expression of HLA class I is presented in Figure 3B.
After treatment of H929 cells with acid, the expression
of HLA class I (MFI = 279) was nearly undetectable by
flow cytometry. In contrast, the MFI of untreated cells
was 4295. In the absence of CFZ, the expression of HLA
class I (MFI = 1848) was observed in nearly 40% of the
untreated cells, and was much lower after CFZ treatment
for 12 hours (MFI = 762, only 17% of the untreated cells).
The proportion of live cells in the presence or absence of
CFZ is shown in Figure 3C. Taken together, these data
show that the expression of newly generated HLA class I
is inhibited by CFZ.

CFZ decreases the expression of HLA-ABC in
MM cell lines and in cells from MM patients
To study the impact of CFZ treatment on
the expression of HLA on MM cells, we used flow
cytometric analysis to test MM cell lines (KMS11, H929,
RPMI8226, OCI-MY5, OPM2, ARK, U266, ARP-1, and
RPMI8226/R5) by gating annexin V and 7AAD doublenegative cells. As shown in Figure 1A, the expression of
HLA class I decreased after 10 nM CFZ treatment, including
the bortezomib resistant cell line RPMI8226/R5. The mean
reduction was 47.7 ± 9.4%. In Figure 1B, we showed that
20 to 40 nM CFZ, used to treat the patients’ MM cells,
down-regulated HLA class I with a mean reduction of 42.8
± 12.4% (n = 9). CFZ induced apoptosis in myeloma cells
is shown in Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B. We also
used CFZ to treat other cancer cell types (one renal cell
carcinoma and two breast cancer cell lines) and normal cells
(CD34+ cells and monocytes), but down-regulation of HLA
class I was not observed (data not shown). These results
suggest the specificity of CFZ induce down-regulation of
HLA class I expression on myeloma cells.
We then used different concentrations of CFZ or
different durations of CFZ treatment on the H929 cell line.
We found that down-regulation of HLA class I expression was
in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 2A and 2B).
These results were confirmed by using immunofluorescence
analyses (Figure 2E and 2F). The kinetics analyses of
apoptosis after CFZ treatment are presented in Supplementary
Figure S1C and S1D. Similar results were obtained in
primary MM cells (Figure 2C and 2D).
HLA-C is a more specialized ligand for KIRs, as
compared to HLA-A and –B, approximately the same level
of down-regulation of HLA-C was obtained after CFZ
treatment (data not shown). Then we investigated whether
the exogenous HLA-C binding peptides (mentioned in
Materials and Methods) could rescue the down-regulation
of HLA-C caused by CFZ. The expression level of

NK cell degranulation is enhanced by CFZ
treatment on myeloma cells
Our previous studies showed that CFZ could
decrease the expression and re-expression levels of HLA
class I on the MM cell surface. To investigate whether
CFZ treatment could activate NK cell functions, a CD107a
degranulation assay was used, and CD107a expression
levels were used to measure NK-cell degranulation [19].
NK cells were incubated with CFZ treated or untreated
MM cells and stained with FITC-conjugated CD107a
and PE-conjugated CD56. Figure 4A–4D show us
representative degranulation assays. When NK cells were
incubated with H929 cells, without CFZ, only a small
percent of CD107a+ NK cells were obtained (Figure 4A).
In contrast, when NK cells were incubated with MM cells

patients’ cells were treated with 20 to 40 nM CFZ. As
shown in Figure 5A, after treatment of H929 cells with
CFZ, the cells showed higher sensitivity to NK cellmediated lysis than untreated H929 cells (mean ± SD:
46.4 ± 3.7% vs 24.2 ± 4.8% at E/T 10:1, P < 0.01). CFZ
also significantly enhanced the sensitivity of patients’
MM cells to NK cell-mediated lysis (mean ± SD: 43.1 ±
6.4% vs 16.1 ± 4.0% at E/T 10:1, n = 9, P < 0.01). Figure
5B–5D represents three of the nine patients’ MM cell
samples. When using CFZ to treat NK cells, the viability
and cytotoxicity of NK cells were not affected (Figure 5E
and 5F).
We found that CFZ treatment enhanced NK cell
degranulation. In order to identify the cytotoxic pathway
used by NK cells, blocking experiments were performed.
The antagonistic antibodies TRAIL and Fas-L had no
effect on the cytotoxicity of NK cell. However, perforin/
granzyme inhibitor CMA prevented the enhancement of NK
cell–mediated lysis in the CFZ treated samples (Figure 5G),
indicating that NK cell killing of MM cells after CFZ
treatment was mediated by perforin/granzyme.

the level of NK cell-mediated lysis was not affected
by blocking TRAIL. The data suggest that CFZ has no
effect on MIC A/B, ULBP 1–3, NKp30-L, NKp44-L, and
NKp46-L (Figure 3A), which are the ligands responsible
for activating receptors NKG2D and NCRs on NK cells.
After using mAb to block NCRs and NKG2D, the levels of
NK cell-mediated lysis in H929 cells were almost the same
(Figure 6F and 6G). Similar results were obtained when we
repeated these blocking experiments with primary human
MM cells (Supplementary Figure S3A–S3C).

DISCUSSION
Inhibition of the proteasome can block the
degradation of misfolded proteins and induce cell
apoptosis [20]. The high level of proteasome activity in
tumor cells suggests the use of proteasome inhibitor as
therapeutic agents against MM [21]. The first-in-class
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib renovated the treatment
of MM due to its anti-myeloma activity both in preclinical
and clinical studies [22–24]. CFZ, a second-generation
proteasome inhibitor which can overcome bortezomib
resistance, is used for treatment of relapsed and refractory
MM [25]. Proteasome also plays a role in processing of
the peptide necessary for MHC class I mediated antigen
presentation [26]. Through affecting such peptide
generation, inhibition of proteasome will block class I
assembly [27]. In this study, we found that CFZ could
decrease the expression of HLA class I in both MM cell
lines and patients’ MM cells. The down-regulation caused
by CFZ occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence
assays. Furthermore, we compared the cell surface levels
of HLA class I on MM cells in the presence or absence
of CFZ after acid treatment. We found that CFZ could
inhibit the re-expression of HLA class I. The results
using CFZ suggest that the proteasome is crucial for the
generation of peptide to assemble class I. Our findings
were in agreement with previous studies [15, 28, 29].
We also found that CFZ treatment could enhance the NK
cell degranulation both in MM cell lines and patients’
MM cells. In addition to perforin/granzyme-mediated
cytotoxity, NK cells also expressed Fas-L and TRAIL to
increase tumor cells killings. We also showed that CFZ
augmented NK-cell cytotoxity by a perforin/granzymemediated mechanism, because such enhancement was
abolished when CMA, but not anti-TRAIL or anti-Fas-L
antibodies, was added.
Studies have shown that haplo-identical killer
immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand (KIR-L)
mismatched NK cells can kill chemo-resistant myeloma cells
[30]. Although this treatment modality can be safely given
to high-risk MM patients, alloreactive NK cell transfusion
cannot always be achieved. This results in inhibition of most
NK cells by HLA class I of patients [31]. We showed that
CFZ treatment could down-regulate the expression of HLA

Enhancement of NK cell-mediated lysis by CFZ
treatment is associated with a decrease of HLA
class I
We previously found that exogenous HLA-C
binding peptides could rescue the down-regulation of
HLA-C during CFZ treatment. To determine if NK cell
cytotoxicity was linked with HLA decreases, cytotoxicity
experiments were used. When exogenous HLA-C binding
peptides and human β2M were added to the CFZ treated
group, specific lysis was reduced to similar levels as the
untreated group (Figure 6A). These results supported the
hypothesis that enhancement of NK-cell mediated lysis by
CFZ was linked with the reduction of HLA class I.
We next investigated if the down-regulation of
HLA caused by CFZ was not an epiphenomenon but
was physiologically relevant. Different concentrations of
HLA-ABC antibody was used to block the HLA class I on
the H929 cell line (Figure 6B) and 10 nM CFZ treatment
could block 58% HLA class I expression (Figure 6C).
A cytotoxicity assay was then used to evaluate NK
cell-mediated lysis. As shown in Figure 6D, increasing
concentrations of HLA antibody led to enhanced NK
cell-mediated lysis. The lysis curves are almost identical
between the CFZ treated MM cells and the 61% HLA
blocked MM cells. These results indicated that HLA class
I reduction caused by CFZ is physiologically relevant
and was compatible with the enhancement of NK cell
cytotoxicity.
We also found that CFZ up-regulated DR4 and DR5
expression on MM cells, which could enhance the NK
cell killing via the TRAIL pathway. We used anti-TRAIL
mAb in CFZ treated H929 cells. As shown in Figure 6E,

class I on MM cells, and could sensitize MM cells to NK cellmediated lysis. The doses of CFZ, used to treat MM cells, did
not affect the NK-cell viability and function, implying that
CFZ might be useful as a NK cell based therapy for MM.
In the cytotoxicity experiment, the exogenous
HLA-C binding peptides, used in the CFZ treated group
rescued the down-regulation of HLA-C and reduced NK
cell-mediated lysis to a similar level as in the untreated
group. This implied that the enhancement of NK cell
cytotoxicity was linked with the down-regulation of HLA
class I caused by CFZ. Such enhancement is demonstrated
by the similar lysis curve, observed when HLA class I
was blocked by using anti-HLA antibody. These results
support our hypothesis that reduction of HLA class I in
CFZ treated cells is physiologically relevant.
The expression of receptors on NK cell surfaces
can either stimulate NK cell reactivity or suppress NK
cell reactivity, and the individual receptors are known as
activating receptors and inhibitory receptors, respectively
[32]. In humans, KIR is one of the most important inhibitory
receptors for HLA class as it governs the capacity of NK cells
to display potent cytotoxicity to cells with low expression
of HLA class I on the cell surface [33]. In addition to KIR,
other activating receptors on NK cells, such as NKG2D, and
the NCRs, NKp46/NCR1, NKp30/NCR3, and NKp44/NCR2
can also regulate NK cell function [34, 35]. MIC A/B and
ULBP1-3 are the two groups of NKG2D ligands in humans.
NCRs are among the first identified activating receptors on
human NK cells. NCRs recognize ligands on a large array of
tumor cells [36], although their physiological ligands remain
unknown [35]. In our study, CFZ treatment had no effect on
the expression of ligands of NKG2D or on NCRs. Blocking
NKG2D and NCRs did not have a significant impact on NK
cell lysis of myeloma cells. Previous studies showed that
proteasome inhibitor could upregulate the TRAIL receptors on
tumor cells [37–39]. Our studies showed that CFZ treatment
could up-regulate DR4 and DR5 expression on MM cell
surface, but NK cell-mediated lysis was not decreased when
TRAIL was blocked. Taken together, our data show that
CFZ augments the NK cell-mediated cell lysis, mainly by
decreasing the expression of HLA class I on MM cell surfaces.
In the present study, we have shown that CFZ
treatment of MM cells down-regulates the HLA class
I expression and enhances NK cell-mediated lysis.
Our study suggests a novel activity of CFZ as an
immunomodulating agent. In the future, CFZ treatment
combined with NK cell based therapies could potentially
enhance NK cell function in MM.

statistical analysis software. Significance was established
at a p value of 0.05 or less.

H929 was used in the Acid treatment to remove
HLA class I molecules from the cell surface. Cells were
centrifuged and the resulting pellet was resuspended
gently in 50 μl of 300 mM glycine (pH 2.5)/1% (w/v)
BSA and incubated for 4 min at 37°C. The suspension
was neutralized by dilution with 100 μl of cell medium
containing 0.5 N NaOH and 0.2 M HEPES and
centrifuged. Cells after acid stripping were resuspended
in the presence or absence of 10 nM CFZ and incubated at
37°C for 12 hours to investigate the effect of CFZ on HLA
class I re-expression.

CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

H929 cell membranes were ruptured with 0.3%
Triton X-100 (St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 minutes at RT.
After washed with ice-cold PBS once, H929 were labeled
in suspension with FITC-anti HLA-ABC for 30 minutes
at 4°C. Then cells were washed with ice-cold PBS once
again. 2, 4-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1000)
in PBS was used for staining nuclei. All sections were
observed with fluorescence microscopy (Olympus).

The authors disclose no potential conflicts of
interest.

CD107a degranulation assay
CFZ treated MM cells were cocultured with
NK cells at an effector/target (E/T) ratio of 5:1. FITC
conjugated CD107a or isotype control was added in
the beginning of the coculture. The culture condition
was mentioned in Cell Culture. After 1 hour, monensin
was added at the concentration of 6 μg /ml. Cells were
incubated for another 3 hours. Then cells were collected
and washed with PBS once and stained with PEconjugated CD56 for 30 minutes at 4°C. After cells were
washed with PBS once, 7AAD were added. Cells were
analyzed on the flow cytometer and the data were analyzed
using FCS Express 3 Flow Cytometry software.
