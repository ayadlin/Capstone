ABSTRACT
Solid tumours naturally grow in 3D wherein the spatial arrangement of cells
affects how they interact with each other. This suggests that 3D cell culture may
mimic the natural in vivo setting better than traditional monolayer (2D) cell culture,
where cells are grown attached to plastic. Here, using HER2-positive breast cancer
cell lines as models (BT474, HCC1954, EFM192A), the effects of culturing cells in
3D using the poly-HEMA method compared to 2D cultures were assessed in terms
of cellular viability, response/resistance to anti-cancer drugs, protein expression
and enzyme activity. Scanning electron microscopy showed the morphology of cells
in 3D to be substantially different to those cultured in 2D. Cell viability in 3D cells
was substantially lower than that of cells in 2D cultures, while 3D cultures were
more resistant to the effects of HER-targeted (neratinib) and classical chemotherapy
(docetaxel) drugs. Expression of proteins involved in cell survival, transporters
associated with drug resistance and drug targets were increased in 3D cultures.
Finally, activity of drug metabolising enzyme CYP3A4 was substantially increased in 3D
compared to 2D cultures. Together this data indicates that the biological information
represented by 3D and 2D cell cultures is substantially different i.e. 3D cell cultures
demonstrate higher innate resistance to anti-cancer drugs compared to 2D cultures,
which may be facilitated by the altered receptor proteins, drug transporters and
metabolising enzyme activity. This highlights the importance of considering 3D in
addition to 2D culture methods in pre-clinical studies of both newer targeted and
more traditional anti-cancer drugs.

cells in 3D mimics the in vivo environment better than
traditional 2D cell culture due to the ability of the cells to
form cell-cell interactions and develop into 3D structures,
as opposed to growing flat and attached to cell culture-grade
plastic. This suggests that 3D culture is more in vivo-like than
2D cultures. This theory is supported by the fact that cells
grown as 2D cultures lose some of their natural functional
abilities; however these changes can be restored simply by
growing cells in 3D again. For example, immortalised human
hepatocyte HepG2 cells are routinely used as a liver model
for drug toxicity testing in vitro. However, when these cells
are grown in traditional 2D culture they lose substantial
amounts of CYP450 enzyme mRNA and activity, that are
critical to liver cells’ ability to metabolise drugs [1, 2], thus
limiting their ability to effectively mimic liver function

INTRODUCTION
In the drug development process and, indeed, any
laboratory setting wishing to mimic as best as possible
the in vivo environment in their pre-clinical studies, it is
important that the experimental model of the disease being
used in testing is as true to life as possible. For breast
cancer research, it is important that the cell models used in
research to further our knowledge of the disease represent
the disease in terms of expression of target receptors, drug
transporters and proteins essential for cell survival and
growth, as well as activity of enzymes responsible for drug
metabolism.
The natural manner in which solid tumours grow in
vivo is three-dimensional. This suggests that growing cancer

however, found that growing the HepG2 cells in 3D using an
ECM hydrogel resulted in restored phenotypic characteristics
of hepatocytes as they occur in vivo in terms of proliferation,
formation of bile canaliculi, and increased levels of CYP3A4
mRNA and activity; which are, ultimately, the liver-like
properties of the cells. Together this data suggests that 3D
cell culture is more similar and relevant to the in vivo setting
than 2D cell culture.
How cells are typically grown in 2D and how
they can be grown in 3D, in the context of their natural
environment, has been reviewed by us [4] and so is not
detailed again here. The field of 3D cell culture research is,
however, still in its infancy in comparison to the knowledge
established on 2D cell culture. Further research is essential
to further characterise this method of growing cells in vitro
for evaluating anti-cancer drugs. Thus, the aim of this study
was to culture cells under conventional 2D conditions and

also using the forced-floating poly-HEMA method of 3D
culture in order to characterise differences observed between
the two methods. More specifically, using three HER2overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (BT474, HCC1954
and EFM192A) we aimed to investigate differences in
expression of cell survival proteins, drug targets and drug
transporters between 2D and 3D cells. Additionally, cell
viability, response to drug treatment and CYP3A4 activity
were compared in both cell culture methods.

RESULTS
Different morphology of cells grown in 2D
versus 3D
SEM imaging revealed an in depth view of the
difference in morphology of cells grown with the 2D and
3D culture methods (Figure 1). BT474 cells grow together

Figure 1: Different morphology of each cell line in 2D and 3D culture. SEM images show how the morphology of cells differs

substantially when grown in 2D compared to 3D cultured cells. For all lines, cells grew attached to the cover-slip when using standard
culture methods. Both BT474 and HCC1954 cells form a tightly packed spheroid when grown in 3D, while EFM192A cells form a less
organised 3D structure when cultured under the same conditions. Scale bars are shown on all images.

in patches in 2D culture but, when grown under forcedfloating conditions, they form uniform spheroids with a
relatively smooth surface. HCC1954 cells in 2D exist more
independently, as opposed to in groups/colonies, and are
more spread out than BT474 cells. HCC1954 3D cultures
form tight spheroids, but with a less smooth surface than
BT474 3D cells. BT474 and HCC1954 cells, when grown
in 3D, appear to secrete an extracellular matrix (ECM)
[5] which smoothens the surface of the sphere and makes
it difficult to distinguish individual cells. Pores appear to
form in the surface of these spheroids. EFM192A cells
grow similarly to BT474 cells in 2D in that they grow in
patches; however, these cells have a more rounded shape.
EFM192A cells cultured under forced-floating conditions
form a 3D structure; however, their 3D shape is not as
tight or homogenous as either the BT474 or HCC1954
spheroids.

(Figure 3(A)). For BT474, 2D cultured cells treated
with neratinib had 62.7±1.2% cell survival compared
with untreated with drug (NT) cells (p=7.3×10-6), while
BT474 3D cells treated with the same concentration of
neratinib showed 90.8±4.5% cell survival compared
to untreated 3D cells (p=0.107), indicating very
limited sensitivity to neratinib in the 3D cultures. The
significantly (p=0.004) increased difference in cell
survival, in the presence of a fixed concentration of
neratinib, between 3D and 2D cells was 28.1±5.4%. A
similar trend was seen in both HCC1954 and EFM192A
cells where 2D cells treated with fixed concentrations
of neratinib showed 64.7±3.9% (p=8.0×10-4) and
59.7±2.1% (p=4.2×10-5) cell survival, respectively,
compared to their untreated 2D counterparts, while
neratinib treated 3D cells maintained a higher
77.3±6.9% (p=0.031) and 86.8±0.6% (p=2.3×10-5)
survival, respectively. In these cell lines the difference
in 3D and 2D cell survival following neratinib treatment
was 12.6±5.3% (p=0.188) and 27.1±2.7% (p=2.3×10-4).
The efficacy of a classical chemotherapeutic drug,
docetaxel, was also reduced in 3D compared to 2D
cultures (Figure 3(B)). BT474 cells cultured in 2D and
treated with docetaxel had 60.3±8.7% survival compared
with untreated cells (p=0.01), while 3D cells treated with
the same concentration of docetaxel maintained 91±5.9%
cell survival compared to untreated 3D cells (p=0.203).
The significant (p=0.043) difference in cell survival
between 3D and 2D cells following the same docetaxel
treatment was 30.7±2.8%. A similar trend was seen in
both HCC1954 and EFM192A cells where 2D cells treated
with fixed concentrations of docetaxel showed 52.3±8.5%
(p=0.005) and 46.2±2.6% (p=4.2×10-5) cell survival,
respectively, compared to untreated 2D cells, while 3D
cells treated with the same concentration of docetaxel
maintained a higher rate of survival at 101.6±5.7%

Altered cell viability in 2D and 3D cell culture
After 6 days of culturing cells that had been seeded
at the same density (specific for each cell line) in 2D,
cellular levels of ATP were measured as an indication
of cell viability (Figure 2). Results showed that BT474
3D cell viability was only 41.6±5.9% of that measured
in BT474 2D cells (p=5.8×10-4). Similarly, HCC1954
3D cell viability was only 18.4±1.5% of that measured
in HCC1954 2D cells (p=6.3×10-7) and EFM192A 3D
cell viability was 44±3.7% that of the EFM192A 2D cells
(p=1.1×10-4).

Decreased drug efficacy in 3D compared to 2D
cultures
Efficacy of the HER-targeted drug, neratinib,
was compared between cells cultured in 2D and 3D

(p=0.795) and 96.2±1.9% (p=0.118), respectively. For
these cell lines, the increase in 3D cell survival compared
to 2D cell survival in response to docetaxel treatment was
49±3.1% (p=0.009) and 50±2.5% (p=1.0×10-4).

pErk decreased in 3D cells in comparison to 2D cultures
when normalised to total Erk in BT474, HCC1954 and
EFM192A cell lines to 0.48±0.1 (p=0.004), 0.29±0.05
(p=1.1×10-4) and 0.49±0.08 (p=0.002). β-actin, established
as unchanged in each of the three cell lines regardless of
culturing conditions, was used as a loading control for
immunoblots. The corresponding densitometry graphs for
these immunoblots are displayed in Figure 4(B).

Cell survival pathways in 2D and 3D cell culture
The effects of different methods of cell culture
on Akt and Erk, important components of cell survival
pathways, were evaluated using immunoblots (Figure
4(A)). Akt expression was found to be increased in cells
cultured in 3D compared to those in 2D, where BT474
3D, HCC1954 3D and EFM192A 3D cells had 2.1±0.2
fold (p=0.002), 4.6±0.8 fold (p=0.009) and 2.0±0.2
fold (p=0.004), respectively, more Akt than their 2D
counterparts. In keeping with this, pAkt was overexpressed when normalised to total Akt in 3D cells where
BT474 3D and HCC1954 3D cells had 1.2±0.03 fold
(p=0.003) and 1.4±0.01 fold (p=2.1×10-6), respectively,
more pAkt than their corresponding 2D cells. pAkt in
EFM192A 3D versus 2D cultured cells decreased to
0.6±0.1 (p=0.015). Similarly, 3D cells had higher levels
of Erk expression where BT474 3D, HCC1954 3D and
EFM192A 3D cells had 1.8±0.2 fold (p=0.013), 2.9±0.3
fold (p=0.002) and 1.7±0.1 fold (p=0.005), respectively,
more Erk than their 2D counterparts. Conversely, levels of

HER-family drug target expression in 2D and 3D
cell culture
The effects of culturing cells in 3D compared to
2D on the expression of the EGFR family of receptors
(targets of HER-targeted therapies), was investigated using
immunoblots (Figure 5(A)). EGFR expression was found
to be increased in both BT474 3D and HCC1954 3D cells
by 4.2±0.5 fold (p=0.003) and 3.3±0.8 fold (p=0.036),
respectively, compared to their 2D counterparts. Similarly,
pEGFR expression was increased (but not significantly)
when normalised to total EGFR in both BT474 3D and
HCC1954 3D cells by 1.4±0.15 fold (p=0.063) and
1.2±0.55 fold (p=0.73), respectively, compared to their
2D control cells. EGFR and subsequently pEGFR were
not found to be expressed by EFM192A cells. Of note,
the analysis for EFM192A cells was performed on the

same blots as that of the BT474 and HCC1954 cells,
which showed that the EGFR and pEGFR antibodies/
conditions were suitable and so supports this observation
with EFM192A 2D and 3D cells.
HER2 expression was found to be increased in
BT474 3D, HCC1954 3D and EFM192A 3D cells by
9.5±1.5 fold (p=0.005), 3.9±0.3 fold (p=0.001) and
1.8±0.2 fold (p=0.013), respectively, compared to their 2D
cells. pHER2 expression was assessed by normalising to
total HER2. pHER2 was reduced to 0.56±0.1 (p=0.012) in
BT474 3D compared to 2D cultures. While there was no
change in pHER2 expression in HCC1954 3D compared
to 2D cells, 1.02±0.1 (p=0.878). pHER2 was increased
in EFM192A 3D cells by 2.1±0.48 fold (p=0.084) in
comparison to cells grown in 2D.
HER3 expression was increased in BT474 3D,
HCC1954 3D and EFM192A 3D cells by 4.0±0.8 fold
(p=0.018), 2.7±0.15 fold (p=2.9×10-4) and 2.3±0.3

fold (p=0.011), respectively, in comparison to their 2D
counterparts. HER4 expression was also increased (albeit
only slightly) in 3D cell cultures compared to 2D, where
BT474 3D, HCC1954 3D and EFM192A 3D HER4
expression increased by 1.28±0.1 (p=0.112), 1.91±0.2
(p=0.005) and 1.31±0.1 (p=0.025). See Figure 5(B) for

2D cultures. BCRP was not found to be significantly
altered in 3D compared to 2D cells. BT474 3D cells had
1.01±0.2 (p=0.962) fold more BCRP compared to BT474
2D cells, HCC1954 3D cells were found to have 0.9±0.1

found to have 2.8±0.1 fold more CYP3A4 activity
compared to that detected in BT474 2D cells (p=1.5×104

5.3±0.7 fold (p=0.003) and 2.1±0.1 fold (p=8.3×10-4) more
CYP3A4 activity, respectively, than their corresponding
2D cells. Additionally, CYP3A4 protein levels were
evaluated and it was found that 3D cells expressed more
CYP3A4 than cells grown as 2D cultures. Specifically,
BT474 3D, HCC1954 3D and EFM192A 3D cells had
2.4±0.7 (p=0.124), 1.7±0.2 (p=0.04) and 1.4±0.1 (p=0.02)
more CYP3A4 than their corresponding 2D cells.

CYP3A4 activity and protein expression in 2D
and 3D cultured cells

DISCUSSION

to cell viability, in order to investigate if culturing cells
using different methods affects the activity of this drug

The poly-HEMA method of 3D cell culture prevents
cell attachment to culture plastic. This encourages the
cells to adhere to each other instead and thus form 3D cell
structures. This is a relatively simple (albeit more labour-

intensive than traditional 2D/monolayer culture) and cheap
method of 3D cell culture that allows for the generation of
a single spheroid per well of a 96 well plate and could be
integrated into most laboratory settings.
The morphology of cells grown using this technique
is substantially different in comparison to traditional
monolayer methods. In 2D culture, cells grow flat and
spread out on the cell culture plastic, whereas in the 3D
cultures cells aggregate together and form spheroids
which have also been reported by others using ECM [6,
7] and poly-HEMA [8] methods for HCC1954, BT474
and EFM192A cells, respectively. This ability to form 3D
structures is not a characteristic of all cell lines, as MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-361
cells have been shown to form only loosely bound, flat
aggregates when grown using the poly-HEMA method
[9]. Furthermore, our SEM images of HCC1954 and
BT474 3D cells indicated that these 3D spheroids form
what is apparently an ECM on their surface through
which pores exist. This characteristic of pores in the
surface of spheroids has been observed with HepG2 liver
cells cultured in 3D using the hanging-drop method [5].
Interestingly, E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, does
not appear to play an essential role in the maintenance of
the 3D spheroids structure (see Supplementary Figure S1).
The reduced cell viability observed in 3D cell
versus 2D cell cultures may be partly contributed to
simply by space (of course, as outlined later, reduced pErk
levels in the 3D cells may also be a contributing factor).
Monolayer/2D cells typically grow continuously, provided
they have the space to do so, but 3D cultures do not follow
the same growth pattern. Due to the logistics of cells
growing in a 3D formation, the cells at the centre do not
receive oxygen (i.e. experience hypoxia) or nutrients to the
same extent as outer cells and so may die as a consequence
of this, resulting in the necrotic core [10]. We found that
apoptotic markers Caspase 3, Caspase 7 and Caspase
9 were increased in 3D cells compared to 2D cells,
which supports this theory that cells are dying and thus
contributing to a hollow core (see Supplementary Figure
S2). While the outermost layer of cells in a spheroid can
proliferate, the middle layer of cells are typically reported
as being comprised of quiescent cells [10]. As a result,
although the same number of cells can be seeded in 2D
and 3D, each of the 2D cells is likely to continue to divide
as are their progeny (while space allows), while only the
cells that form the outer layer of 3D cell cultures are able
to proliferate. It is in this way that the viability of our 3D
cells is likely to be substantially reduced compared to 2D
cultured cells. The reduced viability in 3D, compared to
2D, cells has also been reported by other groups, where
MCF7 breast cancer cells grown in 3D using collagen gels
had substantially reduced proliferation compared to cells
grown in monolayer [11]. Similarly, the proliferation of
a range of colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2, DLD-1, HT29, SW-480, LoVo, COLO-205 and COLO-206f) grown
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in 3D using Matrigel was decreased compared to growth
observed in 2D cells [12].
In vitro drug testing using 2D cell culture is typically
used to establish which, out of a range of lead compounds,
are most effective. Consequently, we investigated the
efficacy of representative targeted (neratinib) and classical
(docetaxel) anti-cancer drugs in both 2D and 3D cultures
in order to determine any differences that culture methods
may have on drug efficacy in vitro. We established that
cells grown in 3D show a degree of resistance to the
effects of both drugs, in comparison to 2D cultures. We
also found that a number of proteins involved in cell
growth and survival (Akt, pAkt, Erk and EGFR family
of receptors), those that are common drug targets (EGFR
and HER2) and a well-established drug-transporter that
confers multiple-drug resistance (PGP), are all increased
in cells grown in 3D. It is likely that the increases in these
proteins contribute to the increase in innate resistance to
the drugs investigated here, as the overexpression of these
proteins has previously been associated with facilitating
acquired drug-resistance. While EMT has previously
been shown to be involved in drug resistance [13], our
investigation of EMT markers, ALDH and β-catenin,
showed no link between 3D drug resistance and EMT (see
Supplementary Figure S1).
Decrease in drug efficacy in 3D cells observed
here has also been reported by other groups. Specifically,
Wen et al. [14] reported that 3D cultures (in Matrigel) of
MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines,
when treated with gemcitabine and 5-FU, had a higher
resistance to the effects of these drugs in comparison to
cells grown in 2D. Similarly, Ponce de León et al. [15]
found that lung cancer INER-51 cells grown in 3D using
agarose, compared to 2D cells, had an increase in resistance
to the effects of doxorubicin, etoposide and methotrexate.
Lovitt et al. [16] reported that the efficacy of epirubicin,
vinorelbine and paclitaxel was reduced in breast cancer
cells grown in 3D using Matrigel when compared to cells
grown in monolayers. Additionally, de le Puenta et al. [17]
also demonstrated that multiple myeloma cells grown in
3D (using Matrigel and AlgiMatrix), compared to their 2D
cultures, are less sensitive to bortezomib and carfilzomib.
Together, this data indicates that cells cultured using 3D
methods have a higher innate resistance to anti-cancer
agents in comparison to cells grown in 2D. Advancing
on this and including HER-targeted drug, neratinib, as
well as traditional chemotherapy, support this increased
innate resistance being relevant also in breast cancer and
to different classes of anti-cancer drugs.
While we found that expression of Akt, pAkt and
Erk were all increased and pErk was down-regulated in
all 3D compared to 2D cell cultures, other groups have
also seen that expression of these proteins can change with
altered growth methods. Konishi et al. [18] found that
ovarian cancer ES-2 cells, grown in 3D using the forcedfloating technique, had increased levels of Akt and pAkt,
45752

and while levels of both Erk and pErk decreased with 3D
cell culture. Caco-2 cells, cultured as 3D spheroids had
increased Erk and pErk expression in 3D compared to 2D
cultures, while Akt was increased but pAkt was decreased
in 3D [12]. In our study perhaps the increased levels of
Akt and pAkt observed in our 3D cells is, at least partially,
responsible for increased resistance to anti-cancer drugs.
It may be that the decrease in viability in cells cultured
in 3D cell versus 2D is due to their decreased levels of
pErk. Collectively, however, the substantial differences in
expression of these proteins by cells grown in 3D and 2D
indicates that these methods of culture do not produce the
same basic biological information within cells.
Similarly, expression of the EGFR family was
found to differ between 2D and 3D cells. Specifically,
EGFR, pEGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 were all found
to be detected at higher levels in 3D cells in comparison
to 2D cells, while results for pHER2 were variable. As
an increase in EGFR and HER2 has previously been
associated with resistance to lapatinib [19, 20], it is
perhaps the case that the overexpression of these receptors
in 3D cells mediates part of the resistance of the cells
cultured in 3D to the effects of neratinib and docetaxel.
Other groups, studying different cell line models to those
included here, have also observed differential expression
of these receptors between 2D and 3D cells. For example,
Konishi et al. [18] also found that EGFR and pEGFR
increase in ovarian ES-2 cells grown in 3D compared to
2D cells. Fong et al. [21] found HER2 was increased in
Ewing sarcoma, EWS, cells grown in 3D using scaffolds
compared to 2D cells. They also measured HER2
expression in in vivo Ewing sarcoma TC-71 xenographs
and found that this increased expression of HER2 in 3D
cells is more representative of HER2 levels seen in the in
vivo xenographs than the lower HER2 expression levels
detected in 2D cells. While Pickl and Reis [22] did not
find any differences in HER2 expression between SKBR3
2D and 3D cells, they reported that pHER2 levels in 3D
cultures to be increased. Weigelt et al. [23] demonstrated
that HER3 expression differs between 2D and 3D cultures.
Specifically, they found that HER3 expression is increased
in HCC1569 breast cancer cells grown in 3D using
Matrigel compared to 2D cells; however, they also showed
that HER3 expression is decreased in AU565, SKBR3 and
BT549 cells grown in 3D compared to 2D cultures. Hua et
al. [24] found that NBL neuroblastoma cells grown in 3D
using the poly-HEMA method have higher levels of HER4
compared to cells grown in 2D.
The expression of PGP, but not BCRP, was found
to be increased in 3D cells in comparison to 2D cells.
Increased levels of this drug transporter could reduce the
levels of substrate drugs within cells in 3D, therefore this
increased PGP expression may contribute to the decrease
in drug efficacy observed in 3D cultures. Doublier et al.
[25] had similar observations and found that growing
MCF7 cells in 3D resulted in higher PGP levels compared
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to cells grown in 2D. They also found that this increase
PGP levels in 3D cells corresponded to a decrease in
doxorubicin accumulation within the cells, in comparison
to cell cultured in 2D.
CYP3A4 is a cytochrome p450 enzyme that plays
a role in the metabolism of at least 50% of drugs being
used in the clinical setting [26]. Also, it has been shown
that elevated levels of this enzyme may contribute to drug
resistance [27]. Due to the prominence of CYP3A4 in
drug metabolism and drug resistance, the activity of this
enzyme was measured and it was found that 3D cells have
higher CYP3A4 activity than 2D cells. This result was
supported by immunoblots that showed that 3D cells had
higher quantities of CYP3A4 protein than cells grown in
2D. Neratinib [28] and docetaxel [29] are both substrates
for CYP3A4 and, as these drugs exhibit decreased efficacy
in 3D cells, it is likely that the increased CYP3A4 activity
in 3D cells is at least partially responsible for the decreased
drug efficacy observed in 3D cells. The increased enzyme
activity in 3D cultures observed here has also been
reported for liver cells, where HepG2 cells cultured in 3D
using Matrigel had higher CYP3A4 activity compared
to that of 2D cultures [3]. Additionally, Takahashi et al.
[30] found that CYP3A4 mRNA levels were increased in
HepG2 cells grown in 3D using the hanging drop method,
in comparison to 2D cells. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report of this observation in
breast cancer. Future studies blocking CYP3A4 activity
and assessing the knock-on effects on drug sensitivity/
resistance are now warranted. Furthermore, further
advancement of these studies to testing resistance of the
spheroids transferred in to extracellular matrix, inducing
cell invasion, could be interesting.
In conclusion, in vitro cell culture is an essential
method for biological sciences and the drug development
process. So, the methods used must be of the highest
quality and relevance to the in vivo situation of the
biological processes being investigated. The data
presented here indicates that the biological information
represented by 2D and 3D cell cultures is fundamentally
different. We showed that the expression of a number of
proteins involved in cell survival, drug targeting and drug
transporters and the protein expression and activity of an
enzyme that plays a major role in drug metabolism are all
increased in 3D compared to 2D cultures. Additionally,
we found that drug efficacy is reduced in cells grown in
3D that show a higher innate resistance to both targeted
and classical chemotherapeutic drugs, compared to 2D
cultures. This increase in resistance is likely facilitated by
the increased protein expression and drug metabolising
enzyme activity observed. The fact that, with very few
exceptions, the observations made were consistent across
all 3 cell line models used gives a level of confidence
that these observations are real, not cell line specific, and
high-lights the importance of considering 3D, not only 2D,
cultures in pre-clinical studies of anti-cancer drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

an EMScope SC500 Sputter Coater at 25mA for 3 minutes
(approximately 15nm coating) and examined at various
magnifications in a Tescan Mira XMU Field Emission
Scanning Electron Microscope at 5Kv using a secondary
electron detector.

2D and 3D cell culture
BT474 and HCC1954 cells were obtained from
ATCC, while EFM192A cells were obtained from the
Leibniz-Institut DSMZ. Cells were cultured in RPMI
supplemented with 1% L-glutamine and 10% FBS.
Cells described as 2D cells refer to those grown in the
typical cell culture manner, attached to T25cm2 or T75cm2
(Corning) plastic cell culture flasks. Cells referred to
as 3D cells were grown under ‘forced floating’ 3D cell
culture conditions [4], where round-bottomed 96 well
plates (Corning) were coated with poly-HEMA (SigmaAldrich). Poly-HEMA was prepared by dissolving 1.2mg
poly-HEMA in 100ml 95% ethanol. 50µl poly-HEMA
solution was added to each well of a round-bottomed
96 well plate and allowed to evaporate. This coating
process was repeated once more and plates were allowed
to dry completely before addition of cells. BT474 and
EFM192A cells were seeded at 5×103 cells/200µl/well,
while HCC1954 cells were seeded at 3×103 cells/200µl/
well. Once seeded, 3D cell plates were centrifuged at 146g
for 5 minutes. 50µl of medium was removed and replaced
with fresh medium every second day.

Viability of 2D and 3D cells measured through
ATP
BT474 and EFM192A cells were seeded at 5×103
cells/200µl/well and HCC1954 cells were seeded at
3×103 cells/200µl/well, for both 2D and 3D cultured
cells. 6 days after seeding, cell viability was determined
by measuring cellular ATP levels using CellTitre-Glo 3D
(Promega). This timing of 6 days was chosen so that the
timing of these assays directly match the timing of the
cells in culture (in 2D and 3D format) for the drug toxicity
assays (described below). Luminescence was read using a
Luminoskan plate reader (Thermo Scientific).

Drug toxicity assays
2D and 3D cells were seeded as per cell viability
assay. 24 hours after seeding, 2D and 3D cells were
treated with the same fixed concentrations of neratinib
and docetaxel. Approximate IC50 concentrations of drugs
were used as established previously in our lab by the acid
phosphatase method. Concentrations of neratinib used
were: 2.5nM – BT474 cells, 49nM – HCC1954 cells and
6.8nM – EFM192A cells. Concentrations of docetaxel
used were: 2.8nM – BT474 cells, 0.6nM – HCC1954 cells
and 2.6nM – EFM192A cells. 5 days after treatment, cell
viability was determined by measuring cellular ATP levels
using CellTitre-Glo 3D (Promega).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging
SEM images were taken 2D and 3D cells. For 2D
SEM images, 3×103 cells in 200µl medium was placed
on a sterile, poly-d-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) coated
coverslip and were allowed to attach overnight. The
next day, medium was removed and cells were washed
with 200µl PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to processing for
SEM. For 3D cultures, cells were seeded and grown for 7
days. Spheroids were collected in a 15ml tube (Corning)
and allowed to settle to the bottom of the tube, washed
with 200µl PBS and allowed to settle to the bottom of
the tube once again. Cells were not centrifuged to prevent
distortion of 3D structure of spheroids. PBS was removed
from the tube, leaving approximately 100-200µl liquid in
the tube with the cells. This small amount of liquid was
pipetted, with the 3D cells, onto the poly-d-lysine coated
coverslip and placed at 4ºC for 30 minutes or until cells
had attached to the coverslip.
For both 2D and 3D cells that were attached to
coverslip, cells were fixed for 60 minutes with 200µl
3% glutaraldehyde (Agar Scientific) and washed 3 times
with 200µl PBS for 10 minutes at 4ºC. Cells were then
dehydrated in serial increasing ethanol concentrations
(10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 95% and 100%) for 5 minutes each
at room temperature. Dehydration was completed with
a 5 minute incubation with 50% hexamethyldisilazane
(Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol at room temperature and a final
5 minute incubation with 100% hexamethyldisilazane at
room temperature. Cells were gold sputter-coated using

Immunoblotting
30µg total cellular sample protein was used for Akt,
pAkt, Erk, pErk EGFR, pEGFR, HER2, pHER2, HER3,
Caspase 3, Caspase 7, Caspase 9, PARP, CYP3A4, ALDH,
β-catenin and E-cadherin, while 50µg total cellular sample
protein was used for HER4, PGP and BCRP immunoblots.
Proteins were resolved on 7.5 – 10% gels and were
transferred to PVDF membrane and blocked using BSA.
Blots were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C
overnight: HER2 (Calbiochem; 1:500), phosphorylated
HER2 (pHER2) (Cell Signalling; 1:1000), EGFR (Cell
Signalling; 1:1000), phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR)
(Cell Signalling; 1:1000), HER3 (Cell Signalling; 1:1000),
HER4 (Cell Signalling; 1:1000), PGP (Santa Cruz; 1:200),
BCRP (Santa Cruz; 1:200), E-Cadherin (Cell Signalling;
1:1000), ALDH (BD; 1:200), β-catenin (Cell Signalling;
1:1000), Caspase 3 (Cell Signalling; 1:1000), Caspase
7 (Cell Signalling; 1:1000), Caspase 9 (Cell Signalling;
1:1000), PARP (Cell Signalling; 1:1000), CYP3A4 (Santa
Cruz; 1:200) and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:1000). Blots
