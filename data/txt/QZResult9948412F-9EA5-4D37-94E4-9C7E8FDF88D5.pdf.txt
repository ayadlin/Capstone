Bone marrow-derived cells play important roles in cancer development and progression. Our
previous studies demonstrated that murine bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts (BMFs) enhanced
tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of BMF actions. We found that coinjection of BMFs with gastric cancer cells markedly promoted tumorigenesis. Co-cultured BMFs
or BMF-conditioned medium (BMF-CM) induced the formation of spheres, which expressed stem
cell signatures and exhibited features of self-renewal, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
tumor initiation. Furthermore, CD44+ fractions in spheres were able to initiate tumorigenesis and
reestablish tumors in serially passaged xenografts. In co-culture systems, BMFs secreted high
levels of murine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), while cancer cells
produced high level of transformation growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). BMF-CM and IL-6 activated
BMFs to produce mHGF, which activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) and upregulated TGF-β1 in human cancer cells. In return, cancer cell-CM stimulated
BMFs to produce IL-6, which was inhibited by anti-TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody. Blockade of
HGF/Met, JAK2/STAT3 and TGF-β1 signaling by specific inhibitors inhibited BMF-induced
sphere formation. STAT3 knockdown in cancer cells also inhibited BMF-induced sphere formation
and tumorigenesis. Moreover, TGF-β1 overexpression in cancer cells was co-related with IL-6 and
HGF overexpression in stromal cells in human gastric cancer tissues. Our results demonstrate that
BMF-derived IL-6/HGF and cancer cell-derived TGF-β1 mediate the interactions between BMFs
and gastric cancer cells, which regulate cancer stemness and promote tumorigenesis. Targeting
inhibition of the interactions between BMFs and cancer cells may be a new strategy for cancer
therapy.

Introduction
Accumulating evidence has shown that tumor stroma plays important roles in cancer
initiation and progression 24. Tumor stromal cells include bone marrow (BM)-derived
myeloid cells and lymphoid cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), myofibroblasts and
endothelial progenitor cells. However, the contributions of these different stromal cells to
tumorigenesis remain unknown. The bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts (BMFs) , a major
cell type of stromal cells 3, have been shown to constitute a MSC niche 25. BMF infiltration
to the gastric tissues is associated with gastric cancer development 29. BMFs have also been
demonstrated to enhance tumor development and invasion17, 25. However, the underlying
mechanisms by which BMFs promote tumorigenesis remain largely unknown.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or CSC-like cells (CSC-LCs) have been shown to play important
roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in many types of tumors 23, 32, including
gastric cancer.27 CSCs are a subpopulation of tumor cells and are featured by their
capabilities of self-renewal and tumor initiation.23 CSCs can be regulated by their stromal
microenvironment 6,31. Studies have shown that tumor stromal cells, including
myofibroblasts 31, MSC 28 , endothelial cells 10 and tumor-associated macrophages 14 ,

induce CSC-like sphere formation of cancer cells. However, whether BMFs promote
tumorigenesis by induction of CSC-LCs remains unclear.

The interactions between stromal cells and cancer cells play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis
and metastasis.6, 21. Tumor myofibroblast-derived factors induced epithelial cell
transformation in co-culture systems and tumorigenesis in xenograft models 13. Conditional
inactivation of the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor in the stroma increased the
myofibroblast population, causing colon epithelial hyperplasia.2 Further studies have shown
that MSC-derived IL-6 activates JAK2/STAT3 signaling in colon cancer cells and induces
sphere formation of cancer cells 28. Colon myofibroblast-secreted HGF was shown to
reprogram differentiated colon cancer cells to CSC-LCs through AKT/Wnt signaling 31. Our
previous studies showed that BMFs secreted higher levels of cytokines (e.g. IL-6),
chemokines (e.g. SDF1), growth factors (e.g. IGF2), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
(e.g. MMP13), and exhibited stronger capabilities of tumorigenesis and tumor invasion than
resident fibroblasts 25. Nevertheless, out of these factors derived from BMFs, the factors that
mediate the activation of cancer cells remain to be investigated. In return, how cancer cells
regulate BMFs is also largely unknown.
In this study, we investigated the interactions between BMFs and gastric cancer cells. Our
results showed that BMF-derived IL-6 and HGF and cancer cell-derived TGF-β1 mediated
the interactions between BMFs and cancer cells, and these interactions contribute to the
induction of CSC-LCs and promote tumorigenesis.

Our previous study has shown that BMFs have stronger capacity to enhance tumor growth
than wild type fibroblasts 25. We then further focused on the study of the effects of BMFs on
tumorigenesis in mice injected with small number of cancer cells. We found that BMFs
enhanced tumorigenesis and tumor growth when BMFs were co-injected with 104 gastric
cancer cell MFC into mice (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining showed a number of
EGFP+α-SMA+ cells (yellow cells) in tumor tissues from mice co-injected with mouse
gastric cancer MFC cells and BMFs (EGFP+), but not in tumor tissues from mice injected
with MFC cells alone (Fig. 1B and supplementary Fig. 1A), suggesting that BMFs can retain
in the tumors and promote tumor growth. Quantification analysis showed that the number of
α-SMA+ (included EGFP+α-SMA+ and EGFP−αSMA+) was significantly higher in tumor
tissues from mice co-injected with MFC cells and BMFs than in tumor tissues from mice
injected with MFC cells alone (Supplementary Fig. 1A), suggesting that BMFs facilitate to
recruit more myofibroblasts and promote tumor growth. The capability of BMFs to enhance
tumorigenesis was further assessed with the highly tumorigenic MKN45 and weakly
tumorigenic MKN28 cells. MKN45 cells and MKN28 cells at the number of 104 were
injected alone or together with BMFs into NOD/SCID mice. We found that 40% of mice
injected with 104 MKN45 cells developed tumors, while 80% of mice co-injected with 104
MKN45 cells and 104 BMFs developed tumors (Fig. 1C). While only 10% of mice injected
with 104 MKN28 cells formed tumors, 60% mice co-injected with 104 MKN28 cells and
BMFs developed tumors (Fig. 1D). Our previous study showed that CD44+ gastric cancer

cells were stem cells (CSCs), whereas CD44− MKN45 cells were non-CSCs and could not
form spheres27. We found that BMFs also enhanced tumorigenesis in CD44− MKN45 cells
(Fig. 1E). However, mice injected with BMFs (2 × 106 cells) alone did not form tumors
(data not shown). The results demonstrate that the co-injected BMFs in vivo promote
tumorigenesis.
BMFs induce sphere formation of gastric cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To investigate whether BMF-promoted tumorigenesis is due to inducing CSCs, we
determined the effects of BMFs on stem-like sphere formation. When co-cultured with
BMFs, MKN45 cells (95% of which were CD44+ cells) formed more and larger spheres
than MNK45 cells cultured alone (Fig. 1F). The co-cultured BMFs also induced sphere
formation of mouse gastric cancer MFC cells (Fig. 1G), human colon cancer cells SW620,
and liver cancer HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1B). We further explored whether BMFs
induce non-CSCs to form spheres. We sorted CD44+ and CD44− MKN45 cells and cocultured them with BMFs. Both CD44+ and CD44− MKN45 cells formed more spheres
when co-cultured with BMFs, compared to those cultured alone (Supplementary Fig. 1C).
Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis showed that 11.5% of CD44− MKN45 cells became CD44+
cells after co-culturing with BMFs, but very few CD44− cells became CD44+ cells when
cultured alone (Supplementary Fig. 1D-1E). To further investigate the effects of BMFs on
non-CSCs, by using CD44 deficient (CD44−) MKN28 gastric cancer cells27. We observed
that MKN28 cells (EGFP− cells) formed spheres when co-cultured with BMFs (EGFP+
cells), while MKN28 cells cultured alone in Stem Cell Medium (SCM) did not (Fig. 1H).
The results indicate that BMFs induce sphere formation of CD44− non-CSCs.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether BMF-induced sphere formation is independent on cell-cell contact,
we used a transwell co-culture system in which MKN28 cells and BMFs were seeded
separately into lower and upper transwells (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The 0.4 μm filter
between the two wells blocks cell penetration but allows media communication. The
indirectly co-cultured MKN28 cells with BMFs formed more and larger spheres than
MKN28 cells indirectly co-cultured with the control HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig.
2A). Furthermore, BMF-CM and Co-culture-CM significantly increased the sphere
formation of MFC, MKN28 and MKN45 cells compared to the SCM, and Co-culture-CM
exhibited the strongest induction of sphere formation (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig.
2B-2C). The results suggest that BMF-derived factors contribute to the sphere formation of
cancer cells.
BMF-induced spheres exhibit CSC properties

Author Manuscript

To determine whether BMF-induced spheres have CSC properties, we digested spheres into
single cells and seeded the single cells into ultralow attachment plates. We observed that
BMF-CM-induced MKN28 spheroid cells (first generation spheres) formed second
generation spheres in SCM (Fig. 2A-2B), confirming that BMF-induced MKN28 spheres
(referred to as MKN28-CSC-LCs) possess the self-renewal feature, one of the CSC
properties. When cultured in attachment culture plates, the MKN28-CSC-LCs exhibited
mesenchymal-like morphology, while the parental MKN28 cells did not (Fig. 2A). When
cultured in SCM, MKN-28-CSC-LCs form more spheres than MKN-28 cells (Fig. 2B).

Western blot showed that the expression of vimentin, snail and TGF-β1 was higher, while
the expression of E-cadherin was lower in MKN28-CSC-LCs than those in parental cells
(Fig. 2C). These results indicate that MKN28-CSC-LCs possess EMT characteristics, one of
CSC features 22. Microarray analysis showed that BMF-induced MKN28-CSC-LCs
overexpressed multiple signaling molecules of CSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3A), including
CD10 (breast tissues stem cell and breast cancer stem cell marker) 20 , KIAA1199 (Wnt/βcatenin pathway) 4 , Hey-1 (Notch signaling) and DUSP6 (STAT3 signaling). RT-PCR
confirmed that the expression of CD10, KIAA119, Hey-1 and DUSP6 was significantly
increased in MKN28-CSC-LCs compared to those in parental MKN28 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 3B).

Author Manuscript

To investigate the in vivo tumorigenic capability of BMF-induced CSC-LCs, different
numbers of MKN28-CSC-LCs were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Mice injected with 102,
103, 104 and 105 MKN28-CSC-LCs developed tumors 3 months after the injection, while
none of the mice injected with 1 × 105 MKN28 parental cells formed tumor (Fig. 2D). To
test whether parental MKN28 cells are tumorigenic, we injected different numbers of
MKN28 cells into mice and found that mice injected with 2 × 105 and 1 × 106 MKN28 cells
could form tumors 3 months after the injection (Supplementary Fig. 2D). These data
demonstrate that parental MKN28 cells are tumorigenic and that MKN28-CSC-LCs initiate
tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

To investigate whether BMF-induced CD44+ cells in spheres contribute to tumorigenesis, we
sorted CD44+ and CD44− cells from the spheres formed from CD44− MKN45 cells cocultured with BMFs. Different numbers of CD44+ and CD44− spheroid cells were injected
into NOD/SCID mice. Mice injected with 102, 103 and 104 CD44+ spheroid cells
respectively, had tumor incidences of 20%, 60% and 80%, whereas mice injected with 104
CD44− spheroid cells did not form tumors (Fig. 2E). The result suggests that CD44+ cells in
spheres initiate tumorigenesis. To further confirm that CD44+ cells possess self-renewal
function in vivo, we performed serial transplantation by injecting the re-isolating CD44+
cells from first transplants (tumors) into recipient SCID mice (as second transplants). The
mice injected with 103 and 104 CD44+ xenograft tumor cells had tumor incidence of 40%
and 60%, whereas mice injected with104 CD44− tumor cells did not formed tumor (Fig. 2F).
These xenograft tumors of both first and second transplants showed the same histology and
expressed CD44+ in vivo (Fig. 2G). These results demonstrate that CD44+ cells are able to
re-establish tumor, to self-renew and sustain tumor growth in serially passaged xenografts.
Taken together, these results indicate that BMF-induced CD44+ fraction in spheres are
gastric cancer stem cells.

BMF-derived IL-6 induces sphere formation of mouse cancer cells
The above results suggest that BMF-derived factors contribute to the induction of CSC-LCs.
To identify these factors, we conducted antibody array analysis of BMF-CM and Co-cultureCM of BMFs and MKN28 cells. The result showed that murine (m) IL-6 level was
significantly higher in Co-culture-CM than that in BMF-CM (Fig. 3A). ELISA assay
confirmed the results of the array (Fig. 3B). RT-PCR also demonstrated that BMFs, cocultured with MKN28 cells, expressed higher level of IL-6 mRNA than BMFs alone did

(Supplementary Fig. 4A). Similar elevation of IL-6 level was obtained in the BMFs cocultured with human AGS cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B). However, the levels of mIL-β1
and mTNF-α were low and not affected by co-culturing (Fig. 3A). In addition, we
determined the level of human IL-6 (hIL-6) in culture medium and found that the level of
hIL-6 did not significantly increased in co-culture medium compared to cancer cell medium
(Supplementary Fig. 4C), suggesting that mouse IL-6, but not human IL-6 plays a major role
in mediating the interactions between BMFs and cancer cells. Using this co-culture system
of murine BMFs and human cancer cells, the cell origins of cytokines, chemokines and
growth factors were readily distinguished using human or mouse specific antibodies or
primers for PCR. Similarly, the co-culturing of BMFs with mouse MFC cells significantly
increased mIL-6 level (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that cancer cells activate BMFs
to produce mIL-6 in the co-culture system.

Author Manuscript

We then studied the role of BMF-derived IL-6 in sphere formation of cancer cells. The preincubation of BMF-CM or Co-culture-CM with mIL-6 neutralizing antibody significantly
decreased sphere formation of mouse MFC cells (Fig. 3D), but did not affect sphere
formation of human MKN28 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4D). These results suggest that
mIL-6 did not involve in mBMF-induced sphere formation of human cancer cells. However,
JSI-124 (a JAK2 inhibitor) significantly reduced BMF-induced sphere formation in both
MKN28 cells and MFC cells (Fig. 3E), suggesting the involvement of JAK2/STAT3 pathway
in the sphere formation of human cancer cells. Although TIMP-2 was also significantly
increased in Co-culture-CM (Fig. 3A), anti-TIMP-2 antibody did not block BMF-CM or Coculture-CM-induced sphere formation of MFC cells(data not shown), indicating that TIMP-2
is not involved in induction of CSCs.

BMF-derived HGF induces sphere formation of human cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To determine which BMF-derived factors contribute to the sphere formation of human
cancer cells, we first examined expressions of cytokines, including SCF, IL-11 and IL-10,
which are known to activate STAT38. RT PCR showed that the mHGF mRNA expression
was significantly higher in BMFs co-cultured with human MKN28 cells than that in BMFs
cultured alone (Supplementary Fig. 4A), whereas the expressions of SCF, IL-11 and IL-10
were not different in the co-cultured BMFs compared to the BMFs cultured alone (data not
shown). ELISA assay showed that the mHGF level was significantly higher in the Coculture-CM of MKN-28 cells and BMFs than that in BMF-CM of BMFs alone (Fig. 4A).
Elevated mHGF was also observed in Co-culture-CM of BMFs and mouse MFC cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5A), suggesting that mHGF was generally involved. To determine the
effect of HGF/Met signaling on sphere formation, we used crizotinib, a Met kinase
inhibitor19, to block HGF/Met signaling. Crizotinib treatment significantly reduced BMFinduced sphere formation in MKN28 and MKN45 cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that murine
BMF-derived HGF is a key factor inducing sphere formation of human cancer cells.
We noted that the elevated expression of mHGF was parallel with the increased expression
of mIL-6 in BMFs (Supplementary Fig. 4A) and hypothesized that IL-6 induced HGF
expression in BMFs. We found that both recombinant mIL-6 (rmIL-6) and rhIL-6 treatment
significantly increased the mRNA expression of mHGF (Fig. 4C) and protein levels of p-

JAK2 and p-STAT3 in BMFs (Fig. 4D). BMF-CM and rmIL-6 treatment stimulated BMFs to
secrete mHGF, while these actions were inhibited by JSI-124 (Fig. 4E). These results
suggest that BMF-derived IL-6 stimulates BMFs to produce mHGF through the JAK2/
STAT3 pathway.

Author Manuscript

We then investigated the roles of IL-6 and HGF in sphere formation. We found that rhIL-6 or
rhHGF treatment induced sphere formation of MKN28 cells and that the combination of
rhIL-6 and rhHGF exhibited stronger induction of sphere formation than rhIL-6 or rhHGF
alone did (Fig. 4F). Similar results were obtained in MFC cells when treated with rIL-6 and
rHGF (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Moreover, rmIL-6 and rmHGF treatment upregulated CD44
expression in MFC cells (Fig. 4G) and increased the percentage of CD44+ cells (Fig. 4H),
consistent with the results shown above (Supplementary Fig.1C-1D). Furthermore, the
combination of JSI-124 and crizotinib significantly inhibited BMF-induced sphere formation
of MFC cells than JSI-124 or crizotinib alone (Supplementary Fig. 5C). These results
indicate that BMF-derived HGF directly induces sphere formation of human cancer cells,
and that BMF-derived IL-6 indirectly contributes to sphere formation of human cancer cells
via the upregulation of mHGF in BMFs.
The activation of STAT3 contributes to BMF-induced sphere formation and tumorigenesis

Author Manuscript

To investigate the mechanisms by which BMF-derived IL-6 and HGF induce sphere
formation, we treated cancer cells with BMF-CM and found that BMF-CM treatment
increased the levels of p-STAT3 and p-Met in MKN28 gastric cancer cells (Fig. 5A). Since
mIL-6 is inactive to human cancer cells, we proposed that mHGF in BMF-CM may
contribute to the STAT3 activation in human cancer cells. Consistent with this hypothesis,
rmHGF treatment increased the levels of p-Met and p-STAT3 in human cancer MKN28 cells
(Fig. 5B), whereas crizotinib inhibited BMF-CM-induced expressions of p-Met and pSTAT3 in human gastric cancer cells (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that BMF-derived
HGF activates STAT3 and Met signaling in human gastric cancer cells.
To determine the role of STAT3 in BMF-induced sphere formation, we established stable
STAT3-knockdown MKN28 colonies (Supplementary Fig. 6A). STAT3 knockdown in
MKN28 cells significantly reduced rhIL-6-induced levels of p-STAT3 and TGF-β1 (Fig. 5D)
and inhibited BMF-CM-induced sphere formation (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, STAT3
knockdown in MKN28 cells inhibited BMF-promoted tumorigenesis and tumor growth in
xenograft models (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. 6B). The results demonstrate that BMFderived IL-6/HGF activate STAT3, which induces sphere formation and tumorigenesis.
Cancer cell-derived TGF-β1 activates BMFs

Author Manuscript

The above results that BMF-induced spheres expressed high level of TGF-β1 (Fig. 2C) and
that co-cultured cancer cells stimulated BMFs to produce mIL-6 (Fig. 3A-3C) suggest
tumor-derived TGF-β1 as a key factor that activates BMFs. Indeed, ELISA showed that
hTGF-β1 level was significantly higher in Co-culture-CM than the level in MKN28-CM,
MKN45-CM and MFC-CM (Fig. 6A-6C), whereas the levels of hIL-1β, hIL-6, and hTNF-α
remained low (data not shown). Furthermore, the pre-incubation of anti-human TGF-β1
neutralizing antibody reduced MKN28-CM and Co-culture-CM-induced mIL-6 production

in BMFs (Fig. 6D). SB-505124 (a TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor) treatment also decreased
MKN28 cell-induced mIL-6 production in BMFs (Fig. 6E). Treatment of gastric cancer cells
with SB-505124 significantly reduced BMF-induced sphere formation (Fig. 6F). These
results demonstrate that cancer cell-derived TGF-β1 activates BMFs in a co-culture system.
Overexpressions of hTGF-β1 and hIL-6 in human gastric cancer tissues

Author Manuscript

To extend our findings to human samples, we investigated the correlation among TGF-β1,
IL-6 and HGF in 41 human gastric cancer tissues (Supplementary Table 1). IHC staining
showed that overexpression of hTGF-β1 was observed mainly in cancer cells, while the
expression of hIL-6 and hHGF was observed in both stromal cells and cancer cells (Fig.
7A). Fifteen out of 41 samples showed high expression of hTGF-β1 and 12 samples showed
high expression of hIL-6. Also, 10 samples showed high expression of both hTGF-β1 and
hIL-6, and 12 samples showed high expression of both hTGF-β1 and hHGF (Supplementary
Table 2). Significant correlations between IL-6 and TGF-β1 expressions, as well as between
HGF and TGF-β1 expression were found (Supplementary Table 2, P < 0.05). The normal
gastric tissues showed only weak hTGF-β1 expression, and all normal samples showed no
hIL-6 and hHGF expression (Fig. 7A). In addition, we analyzed data from 230 patients with
gastric cancer deposited in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-BR-A4PE) database (Cancer
Genome Atlas Network). The expression of HGF was positively correlated with IL-6
expression (Fig. 7B). The expression of TGF-β1 was positively correlated with the
expression of IL-6 and HGF (Fig. 7C-7D). These results support our proposal that the
IL-6/HGF and TGF-β signaling loop is also active in primary human gastric cancers and
contributes to the interactions between BMFs and cancer cells, which promote tumor
growth.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that BMFs could induce non-CSCs to form CSC-LCs. BMFderived IL-6 and HGF activated STAT3 in cancer cells, resulting in the upregulation of TGFβ1 in cancer cells. In return, cancer cell-derived TGF-β1 activated BMFs to produce higher
levels of IL-6 and HGF. Furthermore, the inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 and HGF/c-Met
signaling in BMFs and TGF-β1 signaling in cancer cells significantly inhibited BMFinduced reprogramming of non-CSCs to CSC-LCs and tumorigenesis. Our results reveal a
new crosstalk between BMFs and cancer cells in promoting tumorigenesis through an
IL-6/HGF and TGF-β1 signaling loop.

Tumor stroma has been shown to play an important role in the induction of CSCs.16 Our
results, for the first time, demonstrated that BMFs induced CSC-LCs in gastric cancer cells
and that the BMF-induced CSC-LCs have CSC properties. The evidence includes: (1) BMFinduced CSC-LCs are similar to CSCs in the ability of self-renewal; (2) BMF-induced CSCLCs possess the features of EMT linked to CSCs;26 (3) BMFs or BMF-derived IL-6 and
HGF increased expression of CD44+, a stomach CSC marker; (4) CD44+ cells, but not

Serum IL-6 level has been shown to be associated with gastric cancer progression. Our
observation that the IL-6 level was significantly increased in the BMFs co-cultured with
cancer cells suggests that IL-6 is a major BMF-derived factor induced by cancer cells. The
role of IL-6 in activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in mouse MFC cells is demonstrated by
pre-treatment with anti-mouse IL-6 neutralizing antibody, which significantly inhibited the
effect of BMF-CM on activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling. STAT3 knockdown also
significantly reduced BMF-CM-induced activation of JAK2/STAT3 in mouse MFC cells.
These results demonstrate that STAT3 activation is a key event for BMF-induced CSC-LCs.
We also noted that anti-mouse IL-6 neutralizing antibody did not affect the BMF-CMinduced sphere formation of human cancer cells, due to the fact that mIL-6 can not activate
human IL-6 receptor.11 Nevertheless, the BMFs induced the sphere formation of human
cancer cells, and the addition of JAK2 inhibitor or the STAT3 knockdown significantly
inhibited BMF-CM or BMF-induced sphere formation of human cancer cells. The results
suggest that other factors derived from BMFs activate STAT3 in human cancer cells. Other
than IL-6, STAT3 can be activated by other cytokines and growth factors including HGF,
SCF, IL-11 and IL-10 8. Our findings that BMF-derived HGF induces sphere formation of
human cancer cells is supported by the observation: (1) mHGF was significantly increased in
Co-culture-CM; (2) rmHGF activated STAT3 signaling in human gastric cancer cells; (3)
Met inhibitor significantly suppressed BMFs and BMF-CM-induced sphere formation and
STAT3 activation in human cancer cells.

In this study, an important finding is that BMF-derived IL-6 activates BMFs to produce
mHGF. We found that both rmIL-6 and rhIL-6 activated JAK2/STAT3 signaling and
stimulated mHGF expression in BMFs and that the blockade of JAK2/STAT3 signaling
reduced HGF production. HGF has been shown to activate JAK2/STAT3 signaling in liver
cells 18. Myofibroblasts-derived HGF has been shown to reprogram colon CSC-LCs through
the activation of Wnt signaling.31 Our results indicate that BMF-derived HGF can activate
STAT3 in gastric cancer cells, and BMF-derived IL-6 indirectly contributes to the induction
of CSC-LCs through upregulation of HGF. rIL-6 and rHGF could upregulate expression of
CD44 in gastric cancer cells, consistent with a recent report (42). Our results, for the first
time, showed that IL-6 and HGF cooperated to induce sphere formation of cancer cells,
highlighting the important roles of IL-6 and HGF in tumorigenesis.

We also demonstrated that gastric cancer cells could, in return, activate BMFs. It has been
reported that TNF-α and IL-1β activate myofibroblasts, resulting in the production of
IL-6.7, 9 TGF-β signaling has been shown to play important roles in the regulation of
stemness,33 EMT34 and differentiation of fibroblasts.15 Our finding that gastric cancer cellderived TGF-β1 activated BMFs is supported by the results that (1) the level of hTGF-β1,
but not the levels of hIL-1β and TNF-α, was significantly increased in Co-culture-CM; (2)
cancer cell-CM and Co-culture-CM significantly induced mIL-6 production in BMFs, and
anti-human TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody inhibited their effects; (3) TGF-β1 receptor
inhibitor SB505124 reduced BMF-induced sphere formation of cancer cells; (4) BMFinduced CSC-LCs highly expressed TGF-β1; (5) co-overexpression of hTGF-β1 and hIL-6

was found in human gastric cancer tissues. Our results are similar to the recent reports that
colon cancer-derived TGF-β activates myofibroblasts, resulting in enhanced tumor growth,
invasion and metastasis125 .
In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that BMF-derived IL-6 and HGF activate
STAT3 in cancer cells to secrete TGF-β1, and BMF-derived IL-6 also activates BMFs to
produce HGF. In return, cancer cell-derived TGF-β1 stimulates BMFs to produce IL-6 and
HGF, constituting a positive signaling loop that mediates the interactions between BMFs and
cancer cells and contributes to upregulating CD44 expression and regulating cancer
stemness (Fig. 7E). Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which BMFs
promote tumorigenesis and suggest potential molecular targets for the prevention and
treatment of cancer by inhibiting the interactions between BMFs and cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Human gastric cancer MKN45 cells and MKN28 cells (RIKEN, Japan), AGS cells (ATCC,
Manassas, VA), SGC-7901 cells and mouse gastric cancer MFC cells (Cell Bank, Shanghai),
human colon cancer SW620 cells and human liver cancer cells HepG2 (ATCC, Manassas,
VA), were maintained in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco BRL). BMFs (EGFP+) that were freshly isolated from
gastric dysplastic tissues of IL-1β transgenic mice 29 transplanted with EGFP+ bone marrow
according to our previous method 25. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma by a PCR
method (Stratagene), and all cell lines were mycoplasma negative. BMFs within 12
generations were used. JSI-124 and NSC33994 (JAK2 inhibitor), crizotinib (c-Met inhibitor)
and SB-505124 (TGF-β1 type I receptor inhibitor) were purchased from Sigma and Tocris
(R&D Systems), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20°C. Human (h)
and mouse (m) recombinant (r) IL-6 and HGF purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill,NJ).
The anti-mouse IL-6 neutralizing antibody (Cat. MAB406) and anti-human TGF-β1
antibody (Cat. MAB7364) neutralizing antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, Indiana).
Sphere Formation Assay

Author Manuscript

Stem cell medium (SCM) was prepared by adding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 10
ng/mL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/mL) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) to the
RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 0.1% bovine serum album
(BSA). To prepare BMF-conditioned medium (BMFCM), 1.5 × 106 BMFs were cultured in
10 mL of serum-free RPMI medium without EGF and bFGF for 24 hours. BMF-CM was
collected and stored at −20°C. To prepare co-culture medium of BMFs and cancer cells (Coculture-CM), 1 × 106 BMFs and 1 × 106 cancer cells were co-cultured in 10 mL of serumfree RPMI 1640 medium without EGF and bFGF for 24 hours. The Co-culture-CM was
collected and stored at −20°C.
Cancer cells (1 × 104) were cultured alone or co-cultured with BMFs (2 × 104) in SCM in a
6-well plate for 2 weeks. For an indirect co-culture system, cancer cells and BMFs were

for 2 weeks. In other experiments, cancer cells (1 × 102) were seeded in an ultralow
attachment 96-well plate and cultured with SCM or BMF-CM for 2 weeks. Each group
included triple wells and experiments were repreated three times (n=9). Spheres were
recognized as a 3-dimensional spherical structure composed of cell colonies. The number of
spheres in the entire well was counted, and the percentage of total sphere numbers to the
total seeded cells is referred to as “sphere ratio”.
Antibody array

Author Manuscript

BMFs (1 ×105) and MKN28 cells (1 ×105) were cultured alone or together in 2 ml of RMPI
1640 complete medium in a 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed twice
with PBS and incubated with fresh serum-free RMPI 1640 for another 24 hours. Then, the
BMF-conditioned medium (BMF-CM), MKN28-CM and Co-Culture-CM were collected for
antibody array. The mouse cytokine/chemokine array kits (Ray Biotech Inc. Atlanta, GA)
were used to detect a panel of 24 secreted cytokines and chemokines in BMF-CM and CoCulture-CM. The human cytokine/chemokine array kits (Ray Biotech Inc.) were used to
detect a panel of 24 secreted cytokines and chemokines in MKN28-CM and Co-Culture-CM
according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The spot signal densities of array
membrane were scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences).
The raw numerical densitometry data were extracted from background. The data of samples
were normalized to the positive control signals. The signal intensity for each antigen-specific
antibody spot was proportional to the relative concentration of the antigen in that sample.
The experiments were repreated twice (n=3).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Author Manuscript

BMFs (1 ×105) and cancer cells (1 ×105) were cultured alone or together in 2 ml of
RPMI-1640 complete medium in a 6-well plate for 48 hours. The BMF-CM, cancer cell
conditioned medium (CC-CM) and Co-Culture-CM were collected for ELISA. Each group
included triple wells. The experiments were repreated three times (n=9). Human and mouse
cytokines and growth factors in these CM were quantified using anti-human or mouse
quantitative ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D, Minneapolis,
MN Minneapolis, MN).

cDNA Microarray and Bioinformatics Analysis

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted from MKN28 parental cells and MKN28-CSC-LC spheres.
Affymetrix microarray analysis, fragmentation of RNA, labeling, hybridization to Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays, and scanning were performed by the Microarray
facility of Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix Santa Clara, CA). Gene expression array data of the
NCI-60 cell lines implemented with Affymetix HG-U133A and U133B chip platforms were
downloaded from the CellMiner database (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/).5 Heat
maps were created using dChip software (http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip/).
Classical multidimensional scaling was performed using the standard function of the R
program to provide a visual impression of how the various sample groups are related. The
average-linkage distance was used to assess the similarity of gene expression profiles
between MKN28-CLC-LCs and MKN28 parental cells. The error on such a comparison was
estimated by combining the standard errors (the standard deviation of pairwise linkages
divided by the square root of the number of linkages) of the average-linkage distances
involved. Gene annotation was performed by the ArrayFusion web tool (http://
microarray.ym.edu.tw/tools/arrayfusion/) and gene enrichment analysis by the DAVID 2008
Bioinformatics Resources (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Array data produced in this work
are available from the GEO database (accession no. 16884574).

Immunohistochemistry and tissue array

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Tissue array samples of human gastric cancer were from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai
Jiaotong University School of Medicine. The tissue array section included 41 gastric cancer
tissues and 10 normal gastric tissues. The study was performed according to the guidelines
of the Medical Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine in
China and written informed consent was obtained from all patients at study entry. Tissues
were formalin-fixed, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical staining
was performed as described previously 30. In brief, the tissues sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated and boiled in 0.01M sodium citrate, pH 6.0 for antigen retrieval. The endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched. The sections were incubated with anti-TGF-β1 antibody
(Abcam, Cat. ab66043), anti-IL-6 antibody (Abcam ab6672) or anti-HGF antibody (Abcam,
Cat. ab189511) overnight at 4°C. Tumor sections were incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibodies, streptavidin-biotin complex (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Staining was
visualized using diaminobenzidine. Representative photos were taken with a Nikon Eclipse
E800 microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera (Nikon instruments,
Melville, NY, USA). The result of the immunohistochemistry for gene expression was
judged based on the extent and intensity of staining as follows: (1) The extent of positive
cells was estimated as 0 ≤ 5%, 1 = 6-25%, 2 = 26-50%, 3 = 51-75%, 4 ≥ 75%. (2) The
intensity of staining was judged as 0 = achromatic, 1 = light yellow, 2 = yellow, 3 = brown.
The score of the extent of positive cells was multiplied by the score of the intensity of
staining, and the combined staining score as follows : (−) = 0, (+) = 1-4, (++) = 5-8, (+++) =
9-12. Specimens were considered to have low expression of proteins when the score was 0
or +, and were considered to have high expression for genes when the score was ++ or +++.
This semi-quantitative analysis was done by two independent assessors without prior to
knowledge of the patient outcome.
Immunofluorescence staining
Frozen xenograft tumor sections (5 um) were subjected to double-immunofluorescence
staining by simultaneous incubation of sections with mouse anti-EGFP antibody (Abcam
Cat. Ab184601) and rabbit anti-αSMA antibody (Abcam, Cat. 5694) overnight at 4℃ and

then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and Cy3 redconjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Slides were counterstained with 2 mg/ml DAPI (Vector Laboratories).
Specimens were observed with an Olympus FluoView confocal microscope, and images
were analyzed with Adobe Photoshop. The numbers of DAPI+ cells, EGFP+ cells and /or αSMA+ were counted under × 400 magnification in five random chosen fields. BMFs
fluoresced yellow because of the overlapping green and red emissions. Percentage of
positive cells was expressed as an average of the ratios of positive staining cells to the total
DAPI positive number in 5 random at 400 magnification from tumor sections of three mice
(n=15).

Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Five-week old femal healthy athymic nude or NOD/SCID mice from Harlan Laboratories
(Indianapolis, IN) were maintained in a sterilized animal room at our animal facility. Mice
were randomly divided into different groups and were then injected with different cells.
Cancer cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) alone or together with BMFs into both
flanks of the mice following the Protocol No. 09-050 supervised by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Ethics Committee. Each group included 5 mice with 10
injection sites (n=10). For the injection of spheroid cells, the spheres were digested to single
cells and suspended in PBS. Spheroid cells were injected s.c. both flanks of into NOD/SCID
mice. Each group included 5 mice with 10 site injections (n=10). For the injections of
MKN28-STAT3-shRNA cells, each group included 4 mice with 8 site injections (n=8). For
the injections of different number of MKN28-parentalcells, each group included 3 mice with
6 site injections (n=6). Tumor size was measured weekly by two researchers without
knowledge of cells injected. tumor development was monitored for 3 months. When the
tumor size reached 2 cm3, mice were killed, and tumors were processed for histological and
immunohistochemical analyses.

Supplementary Material

Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments were repeated three times. Power calculations
were performed for animal studies, and the number of mice reflects the number needed to
have sufficient power (80%) to measure the expected difference (≥ 20%) in the incidences of
tumor formation at p < 0.05. Based on our preliminary studies, the numbers of animals are
included. Results were expressed as Means ± SD. Differences between 2 groups was
analyzed for using a 2-tailed Student t test for assuming equal variances, with a P value less
than 0.05 deemed significant. The χ2 test was applied for comparison of dichotomous
variables. One-way ANOVA test was used for comparing the results of 3 or more groups. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL,
USA).

Fig. 1. BMFs enhance tumorigenesis in gastric cancer cells

Author Manuscript

(A) Mouse gastric cancer MFC cells (1 × 104) were injected s.c. alone or together with
BMFs (1 × 104) into the both flanks of nude mice. Each group include 5 mice (10 injection
sites, n=10). Tumor size was measured weekly. Tumor growth curve was shown
accordingly . *P <0.01, compared to MFC cells alone group. (B) The expression of EGFP
and α-SMA was determined by immuofluorescence staining in xenograft tumor tissues from
mice injected with MFC cells alone or together with BMFs (scale bar, 50 μM). (C-E) Highly
tumorigenic gastric cancer MKN45 cells, weakly tumorigenic MKN28 cells and sorted
CD44− MKN45 cells (104 cells) were injected (s.c.) alone or co-injected with BMFs (104)
into both flank of mice (each group included 5 mice with 10 injection sites) in each
experiment. Tumor growth was monitored each week for 3 months. The rate of tumor
formation presented was from 5 mice with 10 injection sites each group (n=10). *P <0.01,
compared to MKN45 cells alone group. (F) MKN45 cells were cultured alone or co-cultured
with BMFs in SCM in attachment 6-well plates for 2 weeks. (G) Mouse gastric cancer cells
MFC were cultured in SCM, BMF-CnM or Co-culture-CM in an ultralow attachment 96well plate for 2 weeks. Representative sphere photos were taken on day 14 (scale bar, 100
μM). (H) MKN28 (EGFP−) cells were cultured alone or with BMFs (EGFP+) for 2 weeks.
All representative sphere photos were taken on day 14 (scale bar, 100 μM).

BMF-derived IL-6 induces sphere formation of mouse cancer cells. (A) BMFs were cultured
alone or co-cultured with MKN28 cells in serum-free media for 48 hours. The levels of
various factors in culture media were measured by antibody array assay and were
normalized to positive control, which is the reagents in the kit which is from Ray Biotech
Company. Data are expressed as fold inductions from duplicate experiments. (B-C) BMFs
were cultured alone, mixed co-cultured, or co-cultured in a transwell system with MKN28
cells (B) and MFC cells (C) for 48 hours. The mIL-6 level in the media was measured by
anti-mouse IL-6 ELISA kit. (D) Mouse MFC cells were cultured for 2 weeks with SCM,
BMF-CM or Co-Culture-CM that has been pre-incubated with anti-mouse IL-6 neutralizing
antibody or control IgG. (E) MFC cells and MKN28 cells were co-cultured with BMFs in
the presence or absence of JSI-124 (0.25 μM) for 2 weeks. All sphere ratios are means ± SD
of 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05, compared to the control groups.
