ABSTRACT
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recognized as a key element
of cell migration, invasion, and drug resistance in several types of cancer. In this
study, our aim was to clarify microRNAs (miRNAs)-related mechanisms underlying
EMT followed by acquired resistance to chemotherapy in glioblastoma (GBM). We
used multiple methods to achieve our goal including microarray analysis, qRT-PCR,
western blotting analysis, loss/gain-of-function analysis, luciferase assays, drug
sensitivity assays, wound-healing assay and invasion assay. We found that miR-203
expression was significantly lower in imatinib-resistant GBM cells (U251AR, U87AR)
that underwent EMT than in their parental cells (U251, U87). Ectopic expression of
miR-203 with miRNA mimics effectively reversed EMT in U251AR and U87AR cells,
and sensitized them to chemotherapy, whereas inhibition of miR-203 in the sensitive
lines with antisense oligonucleotides induced EMT and conferred chemoresistance.
SNAI2 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-203. The knockdown of SNAI2
by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibited EMT and drug resistance. In GBM patients,
miR-203 expression was inversely related to SNAI2 expression, and those tumors
with low expression of miR-203 experienced poorer clinical outcomes. Our findings
indicate that re-expression of miR-203 or targeting SNAI2 might serve as potential
therapeutic approaches to overcome chemotherapy resistance in GBM.

INTRODUCTION

link between resistance to chemotherapy and the induction
of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer [4].
EMT is a process during which cells undergo morphologic
changes from epithelial phenotype to mesenchymal
phenotype, resulting in enhanced motility and increased
invasion, proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis [5, 6].
Tumor cells that have undergone EMT leave the primary
tumor site, invade the extracellular matrix and basement
membrane, colonize distant organs and form metastases.
Therefore, determining the mechanisms that connect EMT

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary
malignant brain tumor in adults, with a median survival
of approximately 14 months after diagnosis [1]. As one
of the standard therapeutic approaches, chemotherapy is
effective to reduce tumor size, inhibit distant metastasis
and prolong patient survival [2]. However, GBM exhibits
a high resistance to chemotherapy and recurrence is
virtually assured [3]. Emerging evidence indicates a strong

and the development of drug resistance is essential for
development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome
drug resistance.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that participate in many cellular processes as essential
gene regulators. They modulate protein expression by
promoting RNA degradation and inhibiting transcription
after binding to the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of
mRNA [7]. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated
that miRNAs have a key role in drug resistance and
EMT. For example, miR-27a is reported to reverse
cisplatin resistance on bladder cancer cells by targeting
SLC7A11 [8]. MiR-135a modulates paclitaxel resistance
by targeting APC in human non-small cell lung cancer
cells [9]. Moreover, recent study has shown that members
of the miR-200 family play key roles in mediating the
effects of TGF-β and other EMT regulators on EMT in
breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma cells [10, 11].
However, miRNAs and their target genes involved in
EMT, resulting in resistance to chemotherapy, are still not
fully understood.
In this study, we screened for miRNAs that were
differentially expressed in the imatinib-resistant GBM
cells, and identified that miR-203 was significantly
downregulated. Next we explored the roles of miR203 and its target SNAI2 in regulating EMT and drug
resistance in GBM cells. Finally, we correlated the
expression of miR-203 with the clinicopathological status
and prognosis of GBM patients.

expression was significantly reduced at the mRNA and
protein levels in U251AR and U87AR cells as compared
with their parental cells (Figure 1C, D). We also examined
the expression of other EMT marker genes by performing
gene expression profiling in both U87 and U87AR cells.
The gene expression profiling revealed that a range of
epithelial marker genes were downregulated and many
mesenchymal marker genes were upregulated in U87AR
cells (Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, qRT-PCR and
western blotting analysis showed that mesenchymal genes
ZEB1 and vimentin were also upregulated in U251AR and
U87AR cells (Figure 1C, D).
To examine whether EMT can promote cell
invasion, we next performed a cell invasion assay which
observed a significant increase in the invasive capacity of
imatinib-resistant cells compared with their parental cells
(Figure 1E). Furthermore, cell viability assay showed that
resistant GBM cells were significantly more capable of
growth than their parental cells (Figure 1F). All together,
these data indicate that imatinib-resistant U251AR
and U87AR cells have undergone EMT with enhanced
invasiveness and increased cell viability.

miR-203 is downregulated in imatinib-resistant
GBM cells and its re-expression sensitizes cells
to anticancer drugs and reverses EMT-like
properties
To screen miRNAs that are potentially involved
in the acquisition of drug resistance and induction of
EMT, we performed microarray miRNA analysis on
U87AR and its parental U87 cells. Microarray analysis
revealed a significant downregulation of 11 miRNAs and
upregulation of 14 miRNAs in U87AR compared with
U87 cells (Figure 2A, B).
MiR-203 was among the top downregulated
miRNAs in U87AR cells and its downregulation was
further validated by qRT-PCR (Figure 3A). To explore
the potential role of miR-203 in drug resistance and EMT,
we used a miR-203 mimic (miR-203) and antagomir-203
(anti-miR-203) to modulate cellular levels of miR-203
in GBM cells. Expression of miR-203 was determined
by qRT-PCR assay after miR-203 or anti-miR-203 was
successfully transferred into U251AR or U87 cells,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 1A, B).
The half maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) values of anticancer drugs (imatinib, VP-16 and
TMZ) in the imatinib-resistant cells and their parental
cells transfected with miR-203 or anti-miR-203 were
determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay to test
the effect of miR-203 expression on the sensitivities of
GBM cells to imatinib, VP-16 and TMZ. As shown in
Figure 3B, C, the IC50 values of imatinib, VP-16 and
TMZ in the U251AR and U87AR cells transfected with
miR-203 were significantly decreased by 1.9-3.3-fold,

RESULTS
Imatinib-resistant U251AR and U87AR cells
exhibit EMT characteristics
By using the parental cell lines U251 and U87,
we previously established the imatinib-resistant GBM
cell lines U251AR and U87AR [12], which had a crossresistance to other anticancer drugs (etoposide/VP-16
and temozolomide/TMZ). We investigated whether the
acquisition of the multidrug-resistant phenotype was
accompanied by morphological changes of the cells. The
parent U251 and U87 cells grew in clusters with tight cellcell junctions, while U251AR and U87AR cells separated
from one other and grew as loosely packed spindle-like
cells (Figure 1A). This suggested U251AR and U87AR
cells had undergone EMT resulting in the acquisition
of mesenchymal properties. We next investigated the
expression and localization of a key epithelial marker
(E-cadherin) in the imatinib-resistant GBM cells compared
with their parental cells. E-cadherin predominantly
localized at cell-cell contacts in U251 and U87 cells,
while the staining intensity was reduced in U251AR
and U87AR cells (Figure 1B). Moreover, E-cadherin

suggesting that upregulation of miR-203 expression could
enhance the sensitivities of U251AR and U87AR cells to
all the three anticancer drugs. In contrast, the IC50 values
of imatinib, VP-16 and TMZ in the U251 and U87 cells
transfected with anti-miR-203 were increased by 2.43.2-fold (Figure 3D, E), indicating that loss of miR-203
promotes resistance to anticancer drugs.
Next, we asked whether miR-203 re-expression
could reverse EMT-like properties of the imatinib-resistant
GBM cells. As shown in Figure 3F, miR-203-transfected

U251AR and U87AR cells showed epithelial cell features,
characterized by cellular aggregation. Western blotting
analysis showed that miR-203 significantly increased the
expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin while decreased
that of mesenchymal markers ZEB1 and vimentin in miR203-transfected U251AR and U87AR cells (Figure 3G).
Furthermore, both transwell invasion and “wound healing”
assays showed decreased invasion and migration activity
of U251AR and U87AR cells in the presence of miR-203,
but remarkably enhanced invasion and migration activity

we found that miR-203 re-expression could induce cell
apoptosis in U251AR and U87AR cells (Supplementary
Figure 2).
Finally,
to
determine
the
potential
clinicopathological implications of altered miR-203
expression, we examined the expression levels of miR203 in the specimens from 80 patients with glioma by
qRT-PCR. The relationships between clinicopathologic

characteristics and miR-203 expression levels in patients
with glioma are summarized in Table 1. No significant
association between miR-203 expression level and
patient’s sex or age was observed in any of the 80 glioma
cases. However, the expression of miR-203 was positively
correlated with the tumor grading (WHO I-II vs. WHO

(Table 1).

SNAI2 is a direct target of miR-203

203 were retrieved from miRTarBase and TargetScan
databases. SNAI2 (also known as slug), a transcriptional
repressor of E-cadherin, was one of the potential
candidates, which gained our attention, because of
the importance of SNAI2 in EMT and drug resistance
[13, 14] and the high conservation of the putative miR-

We next explored the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the drug resistance and EMT-suppressive
effect of miR-203. The predicted target genes of miR-

203-binding sequences in the SNAI2 3′-UTR (Figure
4A). Furthermore, we verified that SNAI2 mRNA was
upregulated in U251AR and U87AR cells (Figure 4B).
To investigate whether SNAI2 is regulated by miR-203,
we next transfected cells with miR-203 or anti-miR-203
and examined SNAI2 expression. qRT-PCR and western
blotting analysis demonstrated that, in U251AR cells with
high levels of SNAI2, restoration of miR-203 reduced
the mRNA and protein expression of SNAI2 (Figure 4C,
D). In contrast, in U87 cells, which express low levels
of SNAI2, miR-203 inhibition by transfection with antimiR-203 increased the mRNA and protein levels of SNAI2
(Figure 4C, D). These results demonstrate that miR-203
directly interacts with SNAI2 mRNA and represses its
expression.
To assess whether miR-203 directly regulates
SNAI2 expression through the target site in the 3′-UTR
of SNAI2, reporter constructs containing either the
wild-type (WT) SNAI2 3′-UTR or SNAI2 3′-UTR with
mutation at the predicted miR-203 target sequence were
cotransfected into U251AR cells together with miR-203,
miRNA control, anti-miR-203 or anti-miRNA control.
Transduction of miR-203 caused marked inhibition of the
WT SNAI2 3′-UTR, but had no effect on mutant SNAI2
3′-UTR (Figure 4E). Meanwhile, miR-203 inhibition by
anti-miR-203 substantially increased luciferase activities
of WT SNAI2 3′-UTR compared with anti-miRNA control
(Figure 4E). All these results strongly suggest that SNAI2
is a direct target of miR-203 in GBM cells.
Finally, to examine the pathological relevance of
this interaction, we detected the expressions of miR-203
and its target SNAI2 in human GBM tissues. As shown in
Figure 4F, SNAI2 expression was negatively correlated
with miR-203 expression in clinical GBM samples
(Pearson’s correlation r= -0.402, p=0.003). In summary,
SNAI2 is upregulated in the imatinib-resistant GBM cells
and a direct target of miR-203, and their expression is
negatively correlated in GBM patients.

of SNAI2 could indeed partially phenocopy the effects
observed on sensitization to anticancer drugs upon
overexpression of miR-203 (Figure 5D). Silencing of
SNAI2 led to significant changes in cell morphology.
The scattered, mesenchymal-like U251AR cells began
to exhibit a more epithelial-like cobblestone appearance
(Figure 5E). As shown in Figure 5F, G, the invasion
and migration of U251AR cells were markedly reduced
after the inhibition of SNAI2 expression. Moreover, we
examined the expression of those EMT marker that we
had analyzed upon overexpression of miR-203 and also
after knockdown of SNAI2 (Figure 5H). Silencing of
SNAI2 increased E-cadherin expression and decreased the
mesenchymal markers ZEB1 and vimentin, showing that
the involvement of miR-203 in EMT could, at least in part,
be via targeting SNAI2.

SNAI2 contributes to chemoresistance and EMT
in GBM cells
We asked if overexpression of SNAI2 could induce
drug resistance and EMT in parental GBM cells. For this
purpose, we developed a stably SNAI2 over-expressing
U87-pcDNA3.1-SNAI2 subline by transfection with
pcDNA3.1-SNAI2 (Supplementary Figure 3). As shown
in Figure 6A, B, overexpression of SNAI2 reduced the
sensitivity of U87 cells to anticancer drugs and induced
a shift in cell morphology from tight cell-cell junctions
to loss of cell-to-cell contact. Also, enforced expression
of SNAI2 promoted cell invasion in vitro (Figure 6C).
Furthermore, the downregulation of epithelial marker
E-cadherin and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers
ZEB1 and vimentin were observed in pcDNA3.1-SNAI2transfected U87 cells (Figure 6D).
To further define the involvement of SNAI2 in the
suppression of chemoresistance and EMT by miR-203,
SNAI2 was transfected into miR-203-overexpressing
U251AR cells. Next, we performed drug sensitivity assay
to evaluate the chemoresistance changes in these cells.
Ectopic expression of SNAI2 significantly rescued miR203-induced inhibition of drug resistance (Figure 6E).
Moreover, reintroduction of SNAI2 markedly antagonized
the inhibitory effect of miR-203 on cell invasion (Figure
6F), abolished the mRNA expression of E-cadherin and
restored ZEB1 and vimentin expression (Figure 6G).
These data suggest a crucial role of SNAI2 in driving
chemoresistance and EMT of GBM cells.

Loss of SNAI2 restores sensitivity to anticancer
drugs and reduces the invasion and migration
capacity of U251AR cells
The direct targeting of SNAI2 by miR-203 led us to
hypothesize that downregulation of SNAI2 by miR-203 in
resistant GBM cells could be involved in drug resistance
and/or EMT. For this purpose, we performed shRNAmediated knockdown of SNAI2 in U251AR cells. The
negative vector (shNC) and shSNAI2 were transfected into
U251AR cells. At 48 hours post-transfection, fluorescent
microscopy showed emission of green fluorescence
(Figure 5A). qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis
showed that SNAI2 expression level was significantly
decreased in shSNAI2-transfected U251AR cells,
compared to control cells (Figure 5B, C). Knockdown

primary GBM and 16 cases of patients with relapsed
GBM by immunohistochemistry. We found that the
expression level of SNAI2 in relapsed GBM patients
with treatment of temozolomide for 6 months was higher
than that in primary GBM patients without treatment of
temozolomide (Figure 7A). In contrast, E-cadherin was
lowly expressed in the relapsed GBM patients (Figure

of SNAI2 was significantly increased in relapsed GBM
samples, whereas E-cadherin mRNA level was reduced
compared to primary GBM tissues (Figure 7B). Finally,
we found that the expression of miR-203 was significantly
reduced (p=0.0026) in relapsed GBM tissues (Figure 7C).
Moreover, patients with higher expression levels of miR203 survived longer (p = 0.0017) than patients with lower
expression levels (Figure 7D).

DISCUSSION

demonstrates that miRNAs are associated with drug
resistance and EMT in many types of tumors. Ujifuku
et al. [15] showed that miR-195, miR-455-3p and miR10a upregulated in temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant GBM
cells, played a critical role in acquired TMZ resistance.
Similarly, downregulation of miR-181 was responsible for
resistance to imatinib by directly targeting the Bcl-2 family
member Mcl-1 in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells
[16]. Also, miR-221 and miR-222 were upregulated while
miR-21, miR-342, and miR-489 were downregulated in
tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells; the reintroduction of
miR-221 or miR-222 rendered the parent MCF-7 cells
resistance to tamoxifen through inhibiting their target
p27Kip1, which was reduced by 50% in resistant cells
[17]. However, not many reports [18-21] explored the
involvement of miRNAs in the development of multidrug
resistance in cancer. Thus, it is a great strength of our
present study which demonstrated that miR-203 reversed
the resistance of GBM cells to three different anticancer
drugs. Although studies have investigated the drug

In this study, we demonstrated that the imatinibresistant U251AR and U87AR cells underwent EMT,
and miR-203 was downregulated in these cells and
clinical relapsed GBM specimens. Re-expression of
miR-203 was capable not only of reversing EMT but
also of sensitizing cells to anticancer drugs and reducing
invasion and migration. Moreover, miR-203 suppressed
the EMT and chemoresistance of GBM cells by targeting
SNAI2. Our findings suggest that after developing drug
resistance, miR-203 expression is reduced leading to a
higher expression of SNAI2 and other targets, and the
cells become more mesenchymal-like and invasive. These
results are supported by clinical data where we found
an inverse correlation between the expression of miR203 and its target SNAI2 in GBM samples. Importantly,
the significance and clinical relevance of miR-203 were
further demonstrated in GBM patients.
Consistent with our finding, increasing evidence

resistance role of a number of miRNAs in various tumors,
the overwhelming majority of other miRNAs are yet to be
further studied regarding the drug resistance.
Numerous inducers of EMT in cancer cells have
been identified including transforming growth factor-β,
Wnt/β-catenin, Snail/SNAI2, Twist and talin [22].
Recently, gain of Twist1 and loss of E-cadherin observed
in GBM specimens were correlated with shorter survival
and poor temozolomide response in GBM patients,
suggesting the involvement of EMT in GBM progression
[23, 24]. Furthermore, acquisition of EMT features has
been associated with drug resistance which could promote
recurrence and metastasis after standard chemotherapeutic
treatment [25]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EMT
also occurs in the imatinib-resistant GBM cells. Similarly,
others characterized EMT in tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancer cells. Ward et al. [26] observed downregulation
of epithelial marker (E-cadherin) expression that was
accompanied by the upregulation of mesenchymal markers
(TGFB2, SMAD3 and ZYX) and EMT transcription
factor, SNAI2, in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells
compared with the parental cells. These findings support
our own observations. Another report showed that EMT
induction in anticancer drug-resistant cells was owing to
increased levels of phosphorylated beta-catenin, which
was associated with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), leading to increased transcription of EMT
regulators [27]. However, in brain tumor, the role of
miRNAs in co-regulation of EMT and drug resistance
remained largely unexplored. This led us to investigate the
potential role of miRNAs in EMT followed by acquired
resistance to chemotherapy in GBM.
Previous studies have shown that miR-203 is
downregulated in metastatic prostate cancer [28] and
colorectal carcinoma [29]. Furthermore, downregulation
of miR-203 confers tumorigenicity ability to esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma cells [30]. A recent study by
Ding et al. [31] described the tumor suppressive effects
of miRNA-203 in breast cancer, showing that loss of
miRNA-203 led to increased invasion and metastatic
potential of the cell system, similar to the results we have
shown in GBM. However, other reports also suggest that
elevated expression of miR-203 in pancreatic tumors is
associated with poorer survival [32]. We found that miR203 suppressed EMT and chemoresistance by targeting
SNAI2 in GBM cells. These results indicate that miR-203
may have a dual function as both a tumor suppressor and
an oncogene, depending on the cellular context and tumor
type. A number of groups have reported DNA methylationmediated downregulation of miRNAs by proximal CpG
islands [33, 34]. Thus, DNA methylation may be involved
in the regulation of miR-203 in imatinib resistant GBM
cells.
Our present data further demonstrate that SNAI2
is a direct target of miR-203 and that miR-203-mediated
inhibition of SNAI2 is dependent on a conversed motif in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the 3′-UTR of SNAI2. Recent independent studies have
shown that overexpression of SNAI2 alters cell invasion,
motility, chemoresistance, metastasis and poor prognosis
in several human cancers [35-38]. As a member of the
snail family of transcription factors, SNAI2 can repress
E-cadherin transcription and induce EMT directly [39].
Therefore, SNAI2 overexpression due to reduction of
miR-203 may result in EMT and chemoresistance in
GBM via these pathways. Additionally, miR-203 may
relieve E-cadherin from transcriptional repression by
targeting SNAI2 signaling. Nevertheless, because one
single miRNA might have multiple targets, judicious
considerations are essential for identiﬁcation of the main
functional targets.
In summary, our study indicates that miR-203 is
an effective inhibitor of EMT and chemoresistance, and
consequently has an important role in the development of
GBM. We further disclose that high expression of miR203 predicts better prognosis in human GBM. Importantly,
miR-203 may serve as an important molecular biomarker
for the GBM patients with drug resistance problem and a
target for treatment of this lethal disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and specimens
Patient tissue samples were obtained from 999 Brain
Hospital (Guangzhou, China), Zhujiang and Nanfang
Hospitals (Southern Medical University, Guangzhou,
China). Patients enrolled in this study included 9 grade I
astrocytoma cases, 13 grade II astrocytoma cases, 7 grade
III astrocytoma cases, and 51 GBM cases. Among 51
GBM cases, 16 GBM cases were relapsed 6 months after
temozolomide therapy. Tissue specimens were snap-frozen
in the operating room immediately during surgery and
sent to a pathology department for diagnosis by a boardcertified neuropathologist. For each patient, a frozen tumor
sample (stored at -80 °C) and a paraffin-embedded tissue
specimen had to be available. Under the protocol approved
by the Institutional Review Board, informed consents were
obtained from the patients or their guardians according to
institutional guidelines.

Cell culture
Human GBM cell lines U251 and U87, were
obtained as a gift from College of Public Health of
Southern Medical University, GuangZhou, China. The
stable imatinib-resistant lines, U251AR and U87AR,
were established and maintained in our laboratory [12].
The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (200 units/ml) and
11

Oncotarget

streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and were incubated at 37 °C in
a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. To
maintain the multidrug resistant phenotype, U251AR and
U87AR were alternately fed with drug-free medium and
medium containing 122 µg/ml of imatinib.

City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The primers were listed in
Supplementary Table 3. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or U6 snRNA was used as
an endogenous control. All samples were normalized to
internal controls and fold changes were calculated through
relative quantification (2-ΔΔCt).

Cell transfection

Western blot analysis

Cells were transiently transfected with 100 nmol/l of
miR-203 mimics (miR-203), antagomirs (anti-miR-203)
and miRNA negative control, or 60 nmol/l short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) specific to SNAI2, scrambled shRNA
negative control (shNC) (Genepharma, Shanghai,
China) by using Lipofectamine 2000 and OPTI-MEM I
(Invitrogen). All of the RNA oligoribonucleotides were
purchased from Genepharma (GenePharma, Shanghai,
China) and the sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table 2. For stable transfection, SNAI2 expression plasmid
(pcDNA3.1 SNAI2) and empty plasmid (pcDNA3.1
mock) were transfected into GBM cells by using
Lipofectamine 2000. Positive transfectants were selected
in 500 µg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). Individual
colonies were harvested 24 h later for the evaluation of
gene expression or functional assays.

Protein lysates were separated by 10% SDSPAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF
(polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore). Then,
the membrane was incubated with rabbit monoclonal
antibody against human SNAI2, ZEB1, E-cadherin and
vimentin (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) followed by
HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-labeled goat-anti rabbit
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and detected by
chemiluminescence. GAPDH was used as a proteinloading control.

Luciferase reporter assay
We cloned the miR-203 response element (wide
type or mutated) in the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of
SNAI2 into psiCheck2 plasmid downstream of luciferase
reporter gene. Luciferase activities were measured using
a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and
target effect was expressed as relative luciferase activity
of the reporter vector with target sequence over the one
without target sequence.

MiRNA microarray analysis
MiRNA microarray analysis was done in the
parental and resistant U87 lines. Briefly, total RNA was
isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy mini
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The samples were labeled using the miRCURYTM Hy3TM/
Hy5TM Power labeling kit (Exiqon) and hybridized on the
miRCURY LNA Array (Exiqon, version 11.0). Scanning
was performed with the Axon GenePix 4000B microarray
scanner. GenePix pro version 6.0 was used to read the
raw intensity of the image. Background subtraction and
normalization were performed. We selected miRNAs
whose expression levels between the parental and resistant
U87 lines differed by at least 1.5-fold.

RNA isolation, reverse transcription,
quantitative real-time PCR

In vitro invasion assay
Cells growing in the log phase were treated with
trypsin and re-suspended as single cell solutions. A
total of 1×105 cells were seeded on a fibronectin-coated
polycarbonate membrane insert in a transwell apparatus
(Corning Inc., USA). In the lower chamber, 600 µl
DMEM with 10% FBS were added as a chemoattractant.
After the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5%
CO2 incubator, the insert was washed with PBS, and cells
on top surface of the insert were removed by a cotton
swab. Except the transwell membrane was precoated with
ECMatrix and the cells were stained with crystal violet
for 10 min and rinsed with PBS. The chambers were then
photographed to compare the amount of invasive cells
on the underside of the membrane for five predetermined
fields (×200). All assays were independently repeated for
at least three times.

and

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
To quantitate miR-203 expression, total RNA was
polyadenylated and reversely transcribed using miRNAs
qPCR Quantitation Kit (Genepharma, Shanghai, China).
To measure the mRNA levels of SNAI2, ZEB1, E-cadherin
and vimentin, total RNA was reversely transcribed using
primeScript RT reagent Kit (Takala, Dalian, China).
Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in ABI7500
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster

Wound healing assay and flow cytometric analysis
of apoptosis

The slides were then washed with PBS and mounted with
mounting medium containing Anti-fade reagent and 4′,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were viewed
under a fluorescence microscope.

Cells were plated at a density of 5×105/cm2 in a sixwell plate, and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for
12 h, allowing cells to completely adhere and spread on
the six-well plate. The cells grew and were maintained
in serum-free DMEM for more than 24 h to create a
confluent monolayer. The confluent monolayer was
scraped with a sterile toothpick and washed with PBS.
Serum-free DMEM was then added and the width of the
wound gaps were measured using NIH Image J analysis
and normalized to the time 0 wounds for four independent
experiments. Apoptosis after transfection treatment was
examined by using the Annexin V/Propidium Iodide
Detection Kit (KeyGEN) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Immunohistochemical analysis
For immunohistochemical analyses of GBM,
paraffin-embedded samples were sliced and mounted
on microscopic slides. Rabbit monoclonal anti-SNAI2
and anti-E-cadherin antibodies (1:200 dilutions, Cell
Signaling Technology, USA) were used as the primary
antibodies. Heat-induced epitope was formed with
a microwave in 10 mmol/l citric acid buffer at pH
7.2. The samples were incubated with the antibody
overnight in the same buffer followed by incubation with
biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500 dilutions, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, USA). The bound antibodies were
visualized by the avidin biotinylated peroxidase complex
methods and diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

In vitro drug sensitivity assay and cell viability
analysis
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1×104 cells
per well after transient transfection or adherence of stable
transfected cells. After 24 h, the cells were treated with
different concentrations of imatinib (Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland), etoposide (VP-16) (Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO) and temozolomide (TMZ) (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), each at four concentrations
ranging from 50 to 200 µg/ml for 48 h. The range of drug
concentrations were based on earlier studies and aimed
at obtaining IC50 values both for highly sensitive and
resistant cases. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured
after incubation with 10 µl of CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo,
Molecular Technologies, Dojindo, Japan) for four hours.
After shaking for one min, the spectrophotometric
absorbance of the samples was determined by using Ultra
Multifunctional Microplate Reader (Tecan) at 450 nm.
The assay was conducted in five replicate wells for each
sample and three parallel experiments were performed.
For cell viability analysis, cells were plated in 96-well
plates at 2×103 per well in a final volume of 100 µl. And
cells were incubated with 50 µg/ml TMZ for 24, 48, 72,
96 and 120 h. Cell growth were determined with CCK-8
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS13.0 software (IBM Corporation, New York, NY,
USA) and GraphPad Prism software 5.0 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The results
were presented as mean±s.d. of three replicate assays.
Statistical analyses were performed using either an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student’s t-test. And
statistical analysis of tissue specimens was performed
using the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the significance
of differences between groups. The relationship between
SNAI2 and miR-203 expression was explored by Pearson
correlation. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated
to evaluate the correlation of miR-203 expression levels
with survival rate. All P<0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance.
