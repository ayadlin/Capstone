Abstract
2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is an endogenous estradiol metabolite that inhibits microtubule polymerization, tumor
growth, and angiogenesis. Because prostate cancer is often
treated with radiotherapy, and 2ME2 has shown efficacy as a
single agent against human prostate carcinoma, we evaluated
2ME2 as a potential radiosensitizer in prostate cancer models.
A dose-dependent decrease in mitogen-activated protein
kinase phosphorylation was observed in human PC3 prostate
cancer cells treated with 2ME2 for 18 h. This decrease
correlated with in vitro radiosensitization measured by clonogenic assays, and these effects were blocked by the expression
of constitutively active MEK. Male nude mice with subcutaneous PC3 xenografts in the hind leg were treated with 2ME2
(75 mg/kg) p.o. for 5 days, and 2 Gy radiation fractions were
delivered each day at 4 h after drug treatment. A statistically
significant super-additive effect between radiation and 2ME2
was observed in this subcutaneous model, using analysis of
within-animal slopes. A PC-3M orthotopic model was also
used, with bioluminescence imaging as an end point. PC-3M
cells stably expressing the luciferase gene were surgically
implanted into the prostates of male nude mice. Mice were
given oral doses of 2ME2 (75 mg/kg), with radiation fractions
(3 Gy) delivered 4 h later. Mice were then imaged weekly for
4 to 5 weeks with a Xenogen system. A significant super-additive
effect was also observed in the orthotopic model. These data
show that 2ME2 is an effective radiosensitizing agent against
human prostate cancer xenografts, and that the mechanism
may involve a decrease in mitogen-activated protein kinase
phosphorylation by 2ME2. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8316–24]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is often treated with radiotherapy; however,
better strategies are necessary to improve therapeutic gain. One
approach is to use a radiosensitizer that has no significant toxicity
by itself at lower doses, yet increases the tumor response to
radiation at these doses. An emerging candidate agent is 2methoxyestradiol (2ME2), which is a naturally occurring metabolite
of 17h-estradiol (1). We have previously shown that 2ME2 enhances
the effects of radiation in lung cancer cells (2). Recent phase II
clinical trials of 2ME2 alone given orally in hormone-refractory
prostate cancer have shown that it is well-tolerated and showed
prostate-specific antigen declines at higher 2ME2 doses (3).
However, there are currently no reports describing the combined

effects of radiation and 2ME2 in prostate cancer models, either
in vitro or in vivo.
As a single agent, 2ME2 has been shown to exhibit both
antiangiogenic and antitumor properties in mice (1, 4). 2ME2
causes the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and
migration, and this is considered a major mechanism by which
2ME2 inhibits angiogenesis (4–6). 2ME2 causes cell death and
growth inhibition in both androgen-independent (PC3 and DU145)
and androgen-dependent (LNCaP) prostate cancer cell lines, which
is attributed to microtubule disruption (7–9). Moreover, several
studies have shown the involvement of signal transduction
pathways in cytotoxicity by 2ME2 in PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cell
lines (10–13). 2ME2 also induces killing of other cell types and the
mechanism is attributed mainly to the inhibition of microtubule
function (14, 15). 2ME2 has been shown to inhibit microtubule
polymerization by binding to the colchicine site of h-tubulin (16).
The mechanisms of action of paclitaxel and 2ME2 are distinct and
opposite: 2ME2 inhibits microtubule polymerization (16), whereas
paclitaxel inhibits microtubule depolymerization (17). Unlike
paclitaxel, 2ME2 is antiangiogenic at doses that are not cytotoxic
to tumor cells (1, 18); furthermore, 2ME2 is a significantly more
effective radiosensitizer than paclitaxel using the same protocol at
equally cytotoxic doses in lung cancer cells (2, 19).
The effects of 2ME2 on activity of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK, also known as ERK or p44/42) in various cell lines
have been previously reported. Initial increases in MAPK
phosphorylation with higher doses (>3 Amol/L) of 2ME2 with a
peak around 60 min have been observed (10, 20). In contrast,
decreases in MAPK phosphorylation or activity have been
measured after longer exposures (overnight or more) with lower
doses (<2 Amol/L) of 2ME2 (21, 22); others have reported no
significant change in MAPK activation with 2ME2 (23). A decrease
in MAPK may be involved in radiosensitization by 2ME2 because
selective inhibition of MEK1/2 (the upstream effector of MAPK)
has been shown to radiosensitize carcinoma cells (24–26). In
addition, MAPK was originally termed ‘‘microtubule-associated
protein kinase’’ (27); the microtubule-associated enzyme pool
constitutes half of all MAPK activity (28). Based on this evidence
and rationale, we have studied 2ME2 as a potential radiosensitizer
in prostate cancer models and have examined the role of MAPK
in the mechanism of these effects.

Luciferin was obtained from Xenogen Corporation, and Matrigel was
purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against h-actin and other
miscellaneous reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemicals.
Cell culture. PC3 human prostate carcinoma cells were obtained from
American Type Tissue Collection. The bioluminescent human prostate carcinoma cell line, PC-3M-luc-C6, was purchased from Xenogen. PC3 cells were
cultured at 37jC, 5% CO2 in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum + penicillin/
streptomycin. PC-3M-luc-C6 cells were cultured as previously described (29).
Western blotting. Western blotting was done as previously described in
detail (30). Whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described (30).
Equal amounts of protein were loaded per lane (100 Ag) onto 7.5% SDSpolyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoresed and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and incubated with
primary and secondary antibody according to the instructions of the
manufacturer, then subjected to chemiluminescence detection and
autoradiography.
In vitro drug and radiation treatments. PC3 cells were plated in 10-cm
dishes and allowed to attach overnight. Serum starvation was not done
prior to any experiments. Log-phase cells were treated for 18 h (unless
otherwise indicated) with various doses of 2ME2 or U0126 (or DMSO vehicle
control). Cells were irradiated at the end of drug treatments using a JL
Shepherd Mark I Cesium-137 gamma irradiator at a dose rate of 1.3 Gy/min,
immediately rinsed, trypsinized, and plated as single cells for colony
formation.
Clonogenic assays. Survival assays were done as previously described
(31). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, counted, diluted, and plated in triplicate
at numbers appropriate for each treatment to obtain f50 to 100 colonies
per dish, and then incubated at 37jC for 10 days. Colonies were fixed and
stained with 0.5% crystal violet in methanol. Colonies were counted, and
surviving fractions (SF) and dose enhancement ratios were calculated as
previously described (31). D0 and n values were calculated by curve-fitting
as previously described (2, 31).
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide and flow
cytometry was done as previously described in detail (2), except that a
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer was used, and data analysis
was done using Flow-Jo software.
Generation of MEK-expressing cells. Plasmid DNA constructs encoding constitutively active MEK1 and the empty vector (pCMV-HA) were
provided by Dr. Michael Weber (Department of Microbiology, University of
Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; ref. 32). Plasmids were transfected into PC3
cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS, as previously described (30). Forty-eight
hours after transfection, cells were passaged into growth medium with
400 Ag/mL of G418, and cells were incubated for 14 days. Six stable clones
were isolated and screened for constitutive phosphorylation of MAPK; a
clone with maximum signal was selected.
Mice and tumor inoculations. Human PC3 cells were used as a
xenograft model in male athymic nude mice [NIH BALB/cAn NCr-nu
(nu/nu), 5–6 weeks old]. For subcutaneous experiments, log-phase cells
were trypsinized and resuspended in a 1:1 PBS/Matrigel solution at 1  107
cells/mL. A suspension of 1  106 cells in a 0.1 mL volume was injected s.c.
into the right posterior hind leg. Tumors were allowed to grow for 7 days
before treatment.
For orthotopic experiments, log-phase PC-3M-luc-C6 cells were resuspended in PBS at 2.5  107/mL. Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/
xylazine mix. Surgery was done to expose the prostate and 20 AL of the
tumor cell suspension (5  105 cells) was injected into the dorsolateral lobe
of the prostate gland. The abdomen was surgically closed and tumors were
allowed to grow for 2 weeks before treatments.
Oral administration of 2ME2. 2ME2 (Panzem) doses were made by
appropriate dilution of the stock solution (50 mg/mL) with vehicle control
(EntreMed). For subcutaneous experiments, mice were treated with 2ME2
for 5 consecutive days with various doses of 2ME2 or vehicle control. In
orthotopic experiments, mice were treated with 2ME2 (75 mg/kg) or vehicle
control for 3 consecutive days. Drug doses were given orally in 0.2 mL
volumes using a 21-gauge, 1.5-in. gavage, 4 h prior to radiation treatments.
Irradiation of tumors. Tumors were irradiated using a Siemens 250 kVp
X-ray irradiator. A custom-built restraining device was used to irradiate five

www.aacrjournals.org

mouse leg tumors at a time, without anesthesia. A dose of 2 Gy on 5
consecutive days was given in subcutaneous experiments; tumors were
measured using a caliper and tumor volume was calculated as previously
described (19). In orthotopic experiments, mice were anesthetized with a
ketamine/xylazine mix and a dose of 3 Gy was given to the prostate area
while shielding the body with lead; this protocol was based on previous
studies on irradiation of orthotopic prostate tumors (33).
Imaging of orthotopic tumors. Two weeks after orthotopic injections,
animals with PC-3M-luc tumors were imaged on a weekly basis. Animals
were anesthetized with isoflurane before and during imaging; mice were
injected i.p. with luciferin (a substrate for luciferase) at 150 mg/kg in a
volume of 0.1 mL (29). Animals were imaged at a peak time of 20 min postluciferin injection via a Xenogen (IVIS) instrument, using exposure times
and sensitivity settings to avoid saturation. Image processing was done as
previously described (29) using Living Image software (Xenogen), by regionof-interest analysis of total photons per second for each tumor, with
appropriate background subtraction.
Statistical analysis. All error bars represent the SE from independent
experiments (n = 3), unless indicated. P values were obtained using a
Student’s t test with Sigma-Plot software; P < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. In vivo tumor growth data was analyzed using
repeated measures models in SAS 9.1 PROC MIXED. F tests were used to
compare groups with respect to tumor growth (within-animal slopes) and to
determine super-additivity.

Results
Effect of 2ME2 on MAPK phosphorylation in PC3 cells.
Previous reports have shown that MAPK phosphorylation or
activity decreases at lower doses of 2ME2 (<2 Amol/L) and later
exposure times (overnight or longer) in endothelial and smooth
muscle cells (21, 22). To test this phenomenon in prostate cancer
cells, androgen-insensitive PC3 human prostate carcinoma cells
were exposed to 1.5 Amol/L of 2ME2 for various times because we
previously found significant radiosensitization in lung cancer cells
using this dose (2). Cells were immediately lysed after 2ME2
treatment and Western blotting was done using antibodies against
phospho-MAPK. A time-dependent decrease in phospho-MAPK
was observed which was optimal at 18 h; decreased phosphorylation was sustained up to 28 h posttreatment (Fig. 1A). Using
an 18-h 2ME2 treatment, a dose-dependent decrease in MAPK
phosphorylation was observed whereas total MAPK levels remained
constant (Fig. 1B); significant decreases compared with untreated
control (P < 0.05) were observed at 1 Amol/L and beyond. At a
dose of 1.5 Amol/L of 2ME2 for 18 h, MAPK phosphorylation was
reduced to 20% of control levels. Other signaling molecules
downstream of Ras were tested using the same treatment protocol
in PC3 cells. No significant changes in phospho-p38, phospho-Akt,
or h-actin (as a loading control) were observed using 2ME2 doses
up to 2 Amol/L (Fig. 1C); phospho-JNK was undetectable in PC3
cells at any of these doses (data not shown).
Radiosensitization by 2ME2 in prostate cancer cells in vitro.
We have previously reported that 2ME2 radiosensitizes lung cancer
cells in vitro (2). Because 2ME2 has shown promise as a single agent
in clinical trials of human prostate cancer (3), and prostate cancer
is often treated with radiotherapy, we tested the radiosensitizing
properties of 2ME2 in PC3 cells in vitro. Cells were treated with
vehicle control (DMSO), 1 Amol/L, or 1.5 Amol/L of 2ME2 for 18 h.
At the end of drug treatments, cells were irradiated with 0, 2, 4, or
6 Gy of ionizing radiation; cells were then rinsed and subjected to
clonogenic assays. The dose-dependent radiosensitizing effects of
2ME2 are shown in Fig. 2A. After normalizing combined agent
survival curves for the effects of 2ME2 alone (SF, 0.8 and 0.5 for

(n) to each other; these values were 3.0 F 0.2, 2.0 F 0.1, and 1.1 F 0.2
for radiation, radiation + 1 Amol/L, and radiation + 1.5 Amol/L,
respectively. The n value is a measure of the survival curve shoulder,
which reflects the cellular capacity for sublethal damage repair; this
is consistent with our previous work showing that 2ME2 inhibits
sublethal damage repair in a dose-dependent fashion in split-dose
recovery experiments (2). In this study, we are defining ‘‘superadditive’’ as follows: the combined effects of radiation and 2ME2
are statistically significantly greater than the sum of the individual
radiation and 2ME2 effects. For these in vitro results, this was
shown using a t test to compare radiation versus radiation + 2ME2
(individual data points normalized for the effects of 2ME2 alone),
for each radiation dose. All data points in Fig. 2A were significantly
different than radiation alone, except for 1 Amol/L + 2 Gy.

or MAPK (representative blots). Fold changes represent phospho-MAPK levels

1 and 1.5 Amol/L, respectively), there was still a significant
separation of the curves compared with radiation alone (P < 0.05).
The dose enhancement ratio is defined as the dose (radiation only)
divided by the dose (radiation + drug) for a given level of survival.
The dose enhancement ratio values, as calculated in a traditional
fashion (at SF 0.1), were 1.2 F 0.1 and 1.7 F 0.2 for 1 and 1.5 Amol/L,
respectively; these were statistically different from each other
(P = 0.007). Using a more clinically relevant level (SF, 0.25), the dose
enhancement ratio values were 1.4 F 0.2 and 2.3 F 0.3 for 1 and
1.5 Amol/L, respectively; these were also statistically different
(P = 0.005). At 2 Gy, a 3.5-fold change in the normalized SF was
observed with radiation + 1.5 Amol/L 2ME2 (SF, 0.2) compared with
radiation alone (SF, 0.7). The D0 values (Gy) for radiation, radiation +
1 Amol/L, and radiation + 1.5 Amol/L were 1.7 F 0.1, 1.6 F 0.1, and
1.5 F 0.1, respectively; these differences were not statistically
significant (P > 0.05). However, statistically significant differences
(P < 0.05) were observed in comparing the extrapolation numbers

2ME2 has been reported to induce a G2-M block in various
cancer and endothelial cell lines (2, 34, 35). Because the G2-M
phase of the cell cycle has long been considered to be the most
radiosensitive (36), we tested the effects of 2ME2 on cell cycle
redistribution. PC3 cells were treated with various doses of
2ME2 for 18 h, fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and
analyzed by flow cytometry. No significant G2-M block was
observed at doses in the range (1–2 Amol/L) used for radiosensitization studies (Fig. 2B). However, mitotic arrest was
observed in a dose-dependent fashion using doses of 3 Amol/L
and above. Thus, the mechanism of radiosensitization in the
dose and time range used in these studies probably does not
involve 2ME2-induced redistribution of PC3 cells into the radiosensitive G2-M phase.
Modulation of MEK and 2ME2-induced radiosensitization.
Selective inhibition of MEK (the upstream effector that phosphorylates MAPK) has been shown to radiosensitize a variety of
cancer cell types (24–26). To test this observation in prostate
cancer cells, a selective chemical inhibitor of MEK, U0126, was
used. When PC3 cells were incubated with U0126 for 18 h, a
dose-dependent reduction in MAPK phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 3A); a dose of 2 Amol/L of U0126 completely

www.aacrjournals.org

abolished MAPK activation. Based on these data, PC3 cells were
treated with 2 Amol/L of U0126 for 18 h, irradiated, and subjected
to clonogenic assays. As expected, treatment with U0126 resulted
in radiosensitization; cells treated with 2ME2 (1.5 Amol/L)
showed a similar response to radiation (Fig. 3B). Cells treated
with 2ME2 plus U0126 for 18 h were not radiosensitized
significantly beyond the levels induced by either agent alone.
This suggests that these two agents are acting through a common
pathway. Additional evidence to support a common mechanism
is that the SF values for 2ME2 and U0126 agents alone were
0.5 and 0.7, respectively; however, the combination of U0126 and
2ME2 (without radiation) resulted in an antagonistic effect (SF,
0.5) because the expected additive SF for independent mechanisms would be 0.5  0.7 = 0.35.
To further address the hypothesis that MAPK may be involved
in 2ME2-induced radiosensitization, a constitutively active MEK1
mutant was used (32). PC3 cells were stably transfected with a
MEK1 construct or the empty vector, and expression was tested;
a clone was then selected for further studies (PC3-MEK1). PC3MEK1 cells showed overexpression of MEK and phospho-MAPK
relative to vector controls (Fig. 3C). In addition, treatment of
PC3-MEK1 cells with 1.5 Amol/L of 2ME2 for 18 h did not

decrease MAPK phosphorylation as observed in untransfected
cells. Finally, PC3-MEK1 cells were not significantly radiosensitized by 1.5 Amol/L of 2ME2, although PC3-vector cells
responded to radiation plus 2ME2 in a similar manner as
untransfected cells (Fig. 3D). This further implicates 2ME2induced modulation of MAPK activity in the mechanism of
radiosensitization by 2ME2.
Response to 2ME2 plus radiation in subcutaneous tumors.
Based on these in vitro studies, a subcutaneous prostate cancer
xenograft model was used to test 2ME2 as a radiosensitizer
in vivo. PC3 cells were injected into the hind leg of male nude
mice, and treatments were started 7 days later. In a pilot
experiment, mice were treated for 5 consecutive days with
various doses of 2ME2 (oral administration). Tumors were then
measured by caliper thrice a week until animals were euthanized
due to tumor size (>1.5 cm diameter). The resulting mean tumor

volume doubling times for various doses are given in Table 1. A
dose of 75 mg/kg was chosen for further studies because this
was the threshold dose for antitumor efficacy with 2ME2 alone;
we have previously observed that super-additive effects with
radiation are optimized when similar threshold doses of other
agents were used.
The response of tumors to 2ME2 plus radiation was examined
using the same system; tumors were irradiated in 2 Gy fractions for
5 consecutive days, 4 h after each 2ME2 treatment (75 mg/kg).
Although we used an 18-h interval for in vitro experiments (single
fraction), the 4-h time interval was chosen based on the relative
complexity of the in vivo system (multiple fractions). Factors
considered in this choice included our previous experience with
microtubule inhibitors as in vivo radiosensitizers (19); pharmacokinetic data for orally administered 2ME2 (3); and our in vitro data
showing that phospho-MAPK levels were still significantly
diminished at 28 h posttreatment (the time interval between
2ME2 administration and radiation treatment on the next day).
Treatment with 2ME2 alone did not induce any significant effect
on tumor growth delay; a modest effect of radiation alone was
observed (Fig. 4A). However, when 2ME2 was combined with
radiation, a large antitumor effect was measured. The agent
combination was shown to elicit a statistically significant superadditive effect (P < 0.0001), using an F test for comparison of mean
tumor growth rates (Fig. 4B).
Effects of combined treatment on orthotopic tumors.
Because the effects of 2ME2 and radiation were super-additive
in the subcutaneous model, a more physiologically relevant
orthotopic prostate model was pursued. Direct tumor volume
measurements are only possible at the end of orthotopic
experiments after euthanasia; thus, a bioluminescence imaging
approach was used. The PC-3M-luc-C6 cell line was used for these
studies; these cells stably express the luciferase gene and are very
tumorigenic. PC-3M-luc cells were surgically implanted into the

prostates of nude mice, and bioluminescence imaging was
initiated 2 weeks postinjection. A pilot experiment was done
with eight untreated mice to optimize the system and to establish
the relationship between tumor volume and mean photons per
second. Peak bioluminescence was found to occur at 20 min postluciferin injection. Three mice were euthanized early due to
tumor size. At the end of the experiment, the five remaining mice
were imaged, euthanized on the same day, and prostate tumors
were excised. Figure 5A shows the relationship between mean
photons per second and tumor weight; the mean photons per
second versus tumor volume (as measured by calipers) is also
shown. In both cases, a linear correlation was observed; thus,
photons per second is a relative measure of tumor volume in this
system.
The effects of combined agent treatment on orthotopic tumor
growth were investigated using the same system, starting with
eight mice per treatment group ( for n < 8, mice died unrelated to
therapy). Two weeks after orthotopic injection, mice were treated
with 2ME2 on 3 consecutive days. The first and third 2ME2 doses
were followed by 3 Gy radiation treatments 4 h later. This protocol
was based on previous experiments showing radiotherapy of
orthotopic tumors in the nude mouse prostate (33), as well as
avoiding consecutive days of anesthesia. A log-linear relationship
(R 2 = 0.994) was observed between the number of mean photons
per second and the number of weeks after treatment in the
untreated control (Fig. 5B), in agreement with published studies for
this xenograft and imaging system (33). Treatment with 2ME2
alone did not result in any significant change in tumor growth.
Radiation alone elicited a significant difference (P < 0.05) in tumor
growth compared with untreated control. Using an F test to
statistically compare the mean growth rates (Fig. 5C), the
interaction between 2ME2 and radiation was super-additive
(P < 0.001). Representative bioluminescence images for the
different treatment groups at week 2 (week of treatments) and
week 5 are shown in Fig. 5D.

Discussion
These studies were pursued because 2ME2 has shown efficacy as
a single agent against human prostate cancer (33), and because
2ME2 is an effective radiosensitizer in non–small cell lung cancer
models (2, 37). Thus, the adjuvant use of 2ME2 with radiotherapy
against prostate cancer may provide a therapeutic benefit. Because
previous reports have shown a decrease in MAPK activity with
2ME2 treatment in noncancer cells (21, 22), and selective inhibition
of the MAPK pathway results in radiosensitization (24–26), we
examined the effects of 2ME2 on MAPK phosphorylation in
prostate cancer cells. These experiments show that MAPK
phosphorylation is significantly reduced using doses of 2ME2
which results in the radiosensitization of PC3 cells, and that cells
expressing constitutively active MEK are not radiosensitized by
2ME2. Importantly, we found that 2ME2 and radiation interact in a
super-additive fashion against either subcutaneous or orthotopic
prostate cancer xenografts.
The lack of 2ME2-induced effects on Akt, p38, or JNK
phosphorylation provides additional evidence for a specific role
of MAPK in radiosensitization because these signaling molecules
are all downstream of Ras. Moreover, we have essentially ruled
out cell cycle redistribution as a potential mechanism of 2ME2/
radiation interactions for this particular in vitro system. A
noncytotoxic 2ME2 dose was used for in vivo studies; thus, it is

www.aacrjournals.org

unlikely that 2ME2-induced cell cycle redistribution is involved in
the in vivo radiosensitization because the G2-M block only occurs
at cytotoxic doses (SF < 0.5) in PC3 cells. Because both 2ME2 and
MAPK bind to h-tubulin (half of the total MAPK is microtubuleassociated; ref. 19, 28), one explanation could be that MAPK
binding to microtubules facilitates phosphorylation by MEK, and
2ME2 binding somehow interferes with this process. However,
due to the complex nature of these interactions, further studies
are necessary to address the mechanism of decreased MAPK
phosphorylation by 2ME2.
MAPK has been implicated as a key effector in intrinsic cellular
radiosensitivity (24–26), and has been shown to activate DNA
repair pathways (31, 38). Selective inhibition of signaling
molecules upstream of MAPK, such as the epidermal growth
factor receptor or Ras, also results in radiosensitization (39–41).
Interestingly, there are several transcription factors that are
activated by MAPK, and these factors regulate genes that are
involved in proliferation, DNA repair, and angiogenesis. We and
others have previously shown that cyclic AMP–responsive
element binding protein, Egr-1, Ets2, and Stat3 are downstream
of MAPK; these transcription factors regulate many important
genes including proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin A, cyclin
D1, and p21 (42). In particular, the expression of dominantnegative cyclic AMP–responsive element binding proteins radiosensitizes cells via reduction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
levels (31, 43). Other transcription factors that are phosphorylated
by MAPK are Sp1 (44) and HIF-1a (which regulates the VEGF
gene; ref. 45). Although HIF-1a protein levels have been shown to
decrease in PC3 cells after 2ME2 treatment (46), this effect occurs
at higher doses (z10 Amol/L) than we have used in this study.
Sp1 regulates key DNA repair genes including DNA-PKcs (PRKDC;
ref. 47), which we have implicated in our previous radiosensitization studies with 2ME2 (2). Thus, MAPK is a central
effector for the serine/threonine phosphorylation and activation
of many transcription factors that regulate genes known to be
involved in DNA repair, tumor proliferation, and angiogenesis.
Based on this rationale, we have studied the effects of
2ME2 alone (without radiation) on phospho-MAPK at the end
of an 18-h treatment because proteins that are important for
radiosensitivity would be expected to be depleted due to
prolonged MAPK inactivation.
The super-additive effect observed in the subcutaneous model
is larger than one would expect on the basis of tumor cell–killing
alone. However, in vitro experiments were not fractionated, and
this may at least partially represent the basis for the difference in
magnitude between effects. In vitro clonogenic experiments also
measure survival, which is a more rigorous end point than tumor
volume (a measure of cell proliferation plus survival). Because
2ME2 is an antiangiogenic agent (1, 4), antiproliferative effects on
endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature may be important in the
mechanism of radiosensitization. This possibility is noteworthy
because 2ME2 has antiangiogenic effects at doses that are
noncytotoxic to tumor cells (1, 2, 4) and these effects may be
further enhanced by radiation. Alternatively, antiangiogenic agents
have been shown to induce vascular normalization within a certain
window of treatment (V1 week), and this phenomenon can lead to
increased tumor reoxygenation (48). Because increased oxygen
delivery can radiosensitize hypoxic tumor cells in a fractionated
radiotherapy regimen, vascular normalization by 2ME2 represents
another plausible mechanism. Thus, the in vivo interaction
between radiation and 2ME2 involves more complexities than the

Figure 5. Effect of 2ME2 plus radiation on the growth of orthotopic PC-3M tumors. PC-3M-luc cells were surgically implanted into the prostates of nude mice.
Two weeks post-injection, bioluminescence imaging was done on a weekly basis. At week 2, mice were treated orally with 2ME2 for 3 consecutive days (75 mg/kg) and
3 Gy of radiation was delivered to the prostate area only, 4 h after the first and third 2ME2 treatments. A, linear correlation between mean photons per second and tumor

in vitro situation, although MAPK phosphorylation levels may still
play a role in either case.
A more robust agent interaction was observed with the
subcutaneous model than with the orthotopic xenografts; there
are a few possible explanations for this difference. First,
treatments were initiated on day 7 in mice with subcutaneous
tumors; due to the technical limitations of the bioluminescence
imaging system (not all tumors were detectable by day 7),

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

treatments were started on day 14 in the orthotopic experiments.
Second, the dosing strategy used was different between the two
models. Irradiation was done on alternating days in the
orthotopic model, but on consecutive days with the subcutaneous
tumors. This was done to avoid exposure to both ketamine ( for
irradiation) and isoflurane ( for imaging) anesthesia on the same
day. To compensate, the radiation fraction size was 3 Gy in
orthotopic experiments, as opposed to 2 Gy in the subcutaneous

model. This may explain the larger effect of radiation alone in the
orthotopic model, and thus, the weaker super-additive effect.
Third, PC-3M is a more aggressive tumor model than the PC3 cell
line, and this may have influenced the agent interaction. Finally,
the implantation of tumor cells into the prostate may provide a
selective advantage for these cells, due to the presence of
prostate-specific physiological factors. For these reasons, the
magnitude of radiosensitization would not be expected to be the
same between the two systems.
In summary, we have shown that 2ME2 radiosensitizes prostate
cancer cells in vitro, and that a decrease in MAPK phosphorylation
may be involved in the mechanism of this effect. Oral administration of 2ME2 prior to radiotherapy resulted in a significantly
improved tumor response compared with the individual agents,
and these effects were super-additive in both subcutaneous and
