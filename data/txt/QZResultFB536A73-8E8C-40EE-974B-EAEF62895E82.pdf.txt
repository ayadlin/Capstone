MicroRNA-200b Reverses Chemoresistance
of Docetaxel-Resistant Human Lung
Adenocarcinoma Cells by Targeting E2F3
Bing Feng, MD; Rui Wang, MD; Hai-Zhu Song, MD; and Long-Bang Chen, MD

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as important posttranscriptional regulators involved in
various biological and pathological processes of cells, but their association with tumor chemoresistance has not been
fully understood. METHODS: We detected miRNA-200b (miR-200b) expression in different lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines and then focused on its roles in regulation of docetaxel chemoresistance. We also identified E2F3 as a novel target of miR-200b. RESULTS: Based on miRNA microarray data, miR-200b was identified as the most down-regulated
miRNA in docetaxel-resistant SPC-A1/DTX cells compared with parental SPC-A1 cells. Ectopic miR-200b expression
reversed docetaxel chemoresistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells through cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis
enhancement, and G2/M cell cycle arrest. In a nude mouse xenograft model, up-regulation of miR-200b significantly
enhanced response of SPC-A1/DTX cells to docetaxel. Luciferase reporters containing the 30 untranslated region
sequence of E2F3 messenger RNA were used to demonstrate that miR-200b could directly target E2F3. Small interfering RNA–mediated E2F3 knockdown revealed similar effects as that of ectopic miR-200b expression. Decreased
miR-200b expression was also detected in tumor tissues sampled from lung adenocarcinoma patients treated with
docetaxel-based chemotherapy and was proved to be correlated with high expression of E2F3, decreased sensitivity
to docetaxel, and poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-200b could lead
to E2F3 overexpression and in turn contribute to chemoresistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to docetaxel. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women worldwide.1 Approximately 70%80% of lung cancers are nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and
large cell carcinoma. Due to the difficulty of early detection, most patients with lung cancer are already at advanced stage
when diagnosed.2 As a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel, docetaxel is widely used in the treatment of advanced NSCLC
and other solid tumors. It inhibits microtubule dynamics by enhancing microtubule polymerization, causing the metaphase to anaphase transition arrest, activating the spindle assembly checkpoint, and subsequently leading to apoptosis.3-5
However, chemoresistance remains the most important obstacle restricting the clinical application of docetaxel.
The resistant phenotype against docetaxel results from both genetic and epigenetic dysregulation of key genes,
involving drug transporters,6 changes in drug metabolism,7 and pathway alterations of cell cycle8-11 and apoptosis.12-14
Identified as important posttranscriptional regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) have expanded the definition of epigenetic
regulation. They are small (19-22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs that bind to the 30 untranslated region (30 -UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), causing either degradation or inhibition of translation, and thereby effectively silencing
their target genes.15 miRNAs are involved in various biological and pathological processes such as differentiation, morphogenesis, and carcinogenesis.16-19 Recently, some studies have highlighted miRNAs linked to chemoresistant phenotype
of different tumors,20 mainly through abnormal regulation of apoptosis,21 cell cycle distribution,22 and function of drug
transporters.23 Only a few studies have focused on the association of miRNA dysregulation with docetaxel resistance of tumor cells.14,24 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no such reports in human lung adenocarcinoma.

Original Article

Based on miRNA microarray data in our previous
work,25 miRNA-200b (miR-200b) was identified as the
most down-regulated miRNA in docetaxel-resistant
human lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A1/DTX cells compared with parental SPC-A1 cells. Given that miR-200b
is closely related to cell cycle distribution,26 cell proliferation, and apoptosis27 in human cancer cells, we hypothesized that down-regulation of miR-200b might be
correlated with chemoresistance of SPC-A1/DTX cells to
docetaxel. In the present study, we attempted to determine the expression and functions of miR-200b and
E2F3 in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, nude
mouse xenograft models, and tumor tissues sampled from
lung adenocarcinoma patients treated with docetaxelbased chemotherapy. Our results show, for the first time,
that miR-200b could function as a chemosensitivity
restorer to docetaxel in human lung adenocarcinoma cells,
mediated at least partially by targeting E2F3, which is critical for the maintenance of normal cell cycle progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Mice
Human lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A1 and A549 cells
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum and ampicillin and streptomycin
at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO2. The docetaxel-resistant SPC-A1 cell line (SPC-A1/
DTX) was established and preserved in a 5 lg/L final concentration of docetaxel in our laboratory.28 Male BALB/c
athymic nude mice (4-6 weeks old) were purchased from
the Department of Comparative Medicine, Jinling Hospital (Nanjing, China), and maintained in a pathogen-free
facility. Animal studies were performed in accordance
with institutional guidelines.
Clinical Tissue Samples
A total of 53 lung adenocarcinoma tissues were collected
from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who
received chemotherapy at Jinling Hospital between
March 2005 and September 2006. Patients met all of the
following criteria: primary lung adenocarcinoma; histological diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with at least 1
measurable lesion; clinical stage IIIB-IV; first-line chemotherapy either with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 100
mg/m2 or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under
the curve 6 mg/mL/min administered every 3 weeks for a
maximum of 5 cycles. Samples were divided into ‘‘sensi-

3366

tive’’ (complete response or partial response) and ‘‘insensitive’’ (stable disease or progressive disease) groups
according to the patient’s responses assessed via medical
image analysis and detection of serum tumor markers after
4 or 5 cycles of docetaxel-based chemotherapy.
Transient Transfection
miR-200b gene-expressing plasmid (pcDNA/miR-200b),
the mock pcDNA-negative control (pcDNA/miR-NC),
miR-200b inhibitor, E2F3 small interfering RNA
(siRNA/E2F3), and nonspecific control siRNA (miRNA/
NC) were all chemically synthesized by GenePharma

using an SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cell Viability Assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2  103 cells/well)
directly or 24 hours after transfection and allowed to
attach overnight. Freshly prepared docetaxel was then
added with different final concentrations. Forty-eight
hours later, cell viability was assessed via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
as described previously.29
Colony Formation Assay
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates directly (5  102
cells/well) or 48 hours after transfection (2  102 cells/
well). After 14 days, cells were fixed with methanol and
stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Visible colonies were
manually counted.
Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptosis
Cells were harvested directly or 48 hours after transfection
via ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid–free trypsinization.
Early apoptosis rate was detected via flow cytometric analysis using an annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene Research Products,
Boston, MA) as described previously.30
Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle
Cells were harvested directly or 48 hours after transfection
and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at 20 C. Fixed
cells were rehydrated in PBS for 10 minutes and subjected
to PI/RNase staining followed by flow cytometric analysis
using a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson,
San Jose, CA) as described previously.31
Xenograft Transplantation and
Immunohistochemistry
Forty-eight hours after transfection with pcDNA/miR200b or pcDNA/miR-NC, SPC-A1/DTX cells (1  106)
were harvested and suspended in 100 lL PBS, then
injected subcutaneously into nude mice on the right side
of the posterior flank (n ¼ 7 mice per group). Tumor
growth was examined every other day, and tumor volumes
were calculated using the equation V ¼ A  B2/2 (mm3),
where A is the largest diameter and B is the perpendicular
diameter. When the average tumor size reached 50
mm3, docetaxel was given via intraperitoneal injection at a

dose of 1 mg/kg, 1 dose every other day, with 3 doses in
total.32 After 2 weeks, all mice were sacrificed. Transplanted tumors were excised, and tumor tissues were used
to perform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining analysis as described previously.33
Dual Luciferase Activity Assay
HEK293T cells were seeded in a 48-well plate and
cotransfected with 200 ng of either pcDNA/miR-200b or
pcDNA/miR-NC vectors, and 10 ng of pLUC vectors
containing firefly luciferase reporter gene, as well as the
30 -UTR of E2F3 gene. Cells were harvested for luciferase
activity assays 48 hours after transfection. A luciferase
assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was used according the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Western Blot Analysis
Cells were harvested directly or 72 hours after transfection,
and total protein lysates were resolved using 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted
onto to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, blocked by
5% skim milk, and probed with mouse anti-human E2F3
or b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).
The membrane was then incubated with rabbit anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Invitrogen).
Protein levels were normalized to b-actin.
Bioinformatic and Statistical Analysis
Online miRNA databases (TargetScan, miRBase Targets,
and PicTarget) were used for prediction of miR-200b target genes. The SPSS 13.0 software system (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Data are
expressed as the mean  standard error of the mean
(SEM). The differences between groups were analyzed
using a Student t test when only 2 groups or 1-way analysis of variance when more than 2 groups were compared.
All tests performed were 2-sided. Differences were considered statistically significant at P<.05.

lung adenocarcinoma cell line (SPC-A1) has been established after the selection by drug pressure and named as
‘‘SPC-A1/DTX.’’28 Compared with parental SPC-A1
cells, SPC-A1/DTX cells are larger in size and have irregular distributions before cell fusion (Figure 1A). MTT
assay was performed on SPC-A1 and SPC-A1/DTX cells,
and the IC50 values for docetaxel were 8.04  1.05 lg/L
and 104.73  3.42 lg/L, respectively (Figure 1B). Colony formation assay revealed significant enhancement of
proliferating ability of SPC-A1/DTX cells (P<.01) (Figure 1C). Predominant accumulation in S phase was

observed in SPC-A1/DTX cells compared with SPC-A1
cells (P<.01) using flow cytometric analysis (Figure 1D),
whereas no significant deviation in apoptosis was observed
(data not shown).
Based on the miRNA microarray data in our previous work,25 53 out of 470 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (>2-fold change) in SPC-A1/DTX
cells compared with SPC-A1 cells, among which miR200b was the most down-regulated one (12.41-fold
change). The result was validated via real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 1E).

miR-200b Expression Affects Cell
Proliferation, Apoptosis, Cell Cycle
Distribution, and Response to Docetaxel
of Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells
To investigate the association of miR-200b expression with
lung adenocarcinoma chemoresistance against docetaxel,
SPC-A1 cells, SPC-A1/DTX cells, and A549 cells were
transfected with miR-200b inhibitor, pcDNA/miR-200b,
and both, respectively. Satisfactory transfection efficiency
was achieved at 48 hours after transfection (Figure 2A).
MTT assay was then performed. The IC50 values for
docetaxel were 7.43  1.16 lg/L and 84.75  3.30 lg/L,
respectively, in miRNA/NC and miR-200b inhibitortransfected SPC-A1 cells; 99.04  3.22 lg/L and 26.70
 2.36 lg/L, respectively, in pcDNA/miR-NC and
pcDNA/miR-200b-transfected SPC-A1/DTX cells; and
6.25  1.08 lg/mL, 8.24  0.93 lg/mL, and 2.83 
0.88 lg/mL, respectively, in miRNA/NC, miR-200b inhibitor, and pcDNA/miR-200b-transfected A549 cells
(Figure 2B). It was therefore concluded that miR-200b
expression level had a close relationship with lung adenocarcinoma chemosensitivity to docetaxel.
Next, we performed colony formation assay and
observed significantly suppressed proliferating ability of
SPC-A1/DTX cells and A549 cells transfected with
pcDNA/miR-200b than that of NC-transfected cells
(P<.01), and significantly enhanced proliferating ability
of miR-200b inhibitor-transfected SPC-A1 cells (P<.05)
(Figure 2C), which further indicated the proliferation inhibitory function of miR-200b in vitro.
To analyze the mechanisms by which ectopic miR200b expression inhibited cell proliferation, flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis was applied. As
shown in Figure 2D, enforced expression of miR-200b
resulted in a dramatic increase of apoptosis in SPC-A1/
DTX cells from 3.36%  0.47% to 13.29%  1.64%
compared with NC (P<.01), but also an increased percentage of cells in G2/M phase from 12.54%  1.28% to
26.60%  2.45% (P<.01) and a decreased population in
S phase from 41.91%  3.70% to 25.35%  1.29%
(P<.01) (Figure 2E). Similar results were obtained in
A549 cells.

SPC-A1/DTX cells were subcutaneously inoculated into
nude mice. One week after inoculation, all mice developed
tumors. When the average tumor size reached 50 mm3,
docetaxel was administered via intraperitoneal injection at
a dose of 1 mg/kg, 1 dose every other day, with 3 doses in
total according to our previous study.32 As shown in Figure 3A, tumors derived from pcDNA/miR-200b–transfected SPC-A1/DTX cells grew substantially more slowly
in comparison with the NC ones. All mice were sacrificed
14 days after the first docetaxel administration. The average size of pcDNA/miR-200b–transfected–SPC-A1/DTX
cell–derived tumors was significantly smaller than that of
the NC ones (Figure 3B). Immunostaining analysis
revealed that the positive rate of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen of tumors formed from pcDNA/miR-200b–transfected SPCA-1/DTX cells was decreased in comparison
with that of the NC ones (Figure 3C), indicating a downregulation of in vivo cell proliferating ability brought by
miR-200b. These results suggested that ectopic miR-200b
expression in SPC-A1/DTX cells could significantly
enhance the in vivo response to docetaxel.
MiR-200b Directly Targets E2F3
By employing open access softwares (TargetScan, miRBase Targets, and PicTarget), transcription factor E2F3
was chosen as a preferred candidate target gene of miR200b because of the 3 complementary sites of miR-200b
in its 30 -UTR (Figure 4A). To investigate whether the
E2F3 gene could exert functional effects in SPC-A1 and
SPC-A1/DTX cells, Western blot analysis was performed
and a 2-fold ( 0.19; P<.05) up-regulation of E2F3 protein expression was detected in SPC-A1/DTX cells compared with SPC-A1 cells (Figure 4B).
After that, we analyzed the effect of enforced miR200b expression on E2F3 expression. As shown in Figure
4C, the level of E2F3 mRNA expression was significantly
decreased in pcDNA/miR-200b–transfected SPC-A1/
DTX and A549 cells (P<.01), and markedly increased in
miR-200b inhibitor-transfected SPC-A1 and A549 cells,
in comparison with that in NC-transfected cells (P<.01).
The inverse correlation between miR-200b expression
and E2F3 protein levels was verified via Western blot
analysis (Figure 4D).
To further confirm the possibility that miR-200b
targets E2F3, the miR-200b binding sequences present at
the 30 -UTR of E2F3 mRNA were subcloned downstream
of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in pLUC vectors
(Figure 4E) and then cotransfected with pcDNA/miR200b or pcDNA/miR-NC into HEK293T cells. The

whereas the luciferase activity of the non–30 -UTR reporter was unaffected (Figure 4F), indicating that miR200b may suppress E2F3 gene expression through the 30 UTR binding and silencing of E2F3 mRNA.

expression levels of E2F3 (A) messenger RNA (mRNA) and (B) protein were detected at 48 hours via real-time quantitative

become more sensitive to docetaxel after siRNA-mediated E2F3 knockdown. (D) Colony formation assay reveals suppressed proliferating ability of SPC-A1/DTX cells with down-regulated E2F3 expression.

Because the effects were similar to those of ectopic miR200b expression, we propose that E2F3 targeting may be
a mechanism of miR-200b’s regulation on docetaxel sensitivity of human lung adenocarcinoma cells.

200b was significantly down-regulated in the ‘‘insensitive’’
group tissues (n ¼ 30) compared with that in the ‘‘sensitive’’ group ones (n ¼ 23) (P<.01) with a strong positive
correlation with docetaxel sensitivity (Spearman rank test,
rho ¼ 0.77, P<.01). On the contrary, E2F3 mRNA
expression level was significantly up-regulated in the
‘‘insensitive’’ group tissues (P<.01) (Figure 6B), with a
strong negative correlation with docetaxel sensitivity
(Spearman rank test, rho ¼ 0.84, P<.01). The inverse
correlation between miR-200b and E2F3 mRNA expression was verified by linear regression analysis (Spearman
rank test rho ¼ 0.68, P<.01) (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
To better understand the biological mechanisms of chemoresistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells and search for
the reversion opportunities, docetaxel-resistant human
lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A1 (SPC-A1/DTX)
has been established in our laboratory after the selection
by drug pressure, and several molecular mechanisms have
been proved to be involved in its docetaxel-resistant phenotype, including enhanced efflux consequent to
increased expression of ABC transporter (eg, P-gp, MRP),
multiple changes to apoptosis signaling (eg, dysregulation
of Bcl-2/Bax and overexpression of Survivin), and altered
expression of b-tubulin isoforms.28 Based on the miRNA
microarray profiling between the 2 cell lines,25 a series of
miRNAs have been hypothesized as docetaxel resistance–
associated. In this study, we focused on miR-200b, which
was the most down-regulated miRNA in SPC-A1/DTX
cells.
With aberrant expression in many human cancers,34,35 miR-200b was generally considered a negative
regulator of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) in
tumor cell migration and invasion.36 Recently, it was
reported that miR-200b directly reduced the expression
of RND3, thereby promoting expression of the downstream protein cyclin D1 and S-phase entry in cervical
cancer cells.26 Furthermore, the classic anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was proved to be negatively regulated by miR-

3374

200b in gastric cancer cells, causing increased apoptosis
and inhibited cell proliferation.27 In this study, we demonstrated that ectopic miR-200b expression could lead to
E2F3 down-regulation, cause cell proliferation suppression, apoptosis enhancement, and G2/M phase arrest,
and in turn contribute to docetaxel resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we
proposed that miR-200b may act as a tumor suppressor to
reverse docetaxel resistance of human lung adenocarcinoma cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first to
show the association of miR-200b expression with docetaxel chemoresistance of human lung adenocarcinoma.
Cell cycle dysregulation is an underlying mechanism
for chemoresistance against cell cycle–specific agents.
With overexpression in 55%-70% of squamous cell lung
carcinomas and 79% of lung adenocarcinomas,37 E2F3
was generally considered to increase cellular proliferation
as a transcriptional activator through the G1/S transition.38,39 Recent studies have suggested that E2F3 could
also modulate genes involved in entry to and progression
through mitosis such as Cdk1,40 Aurora-A,41 and Survivin.42 Herein, we demonstrated that E2F3 was a direct
target of miR-200b. siRNA-mediated E2F3 knockdown
yielded very much similar effects as that of ectopic miR200b expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover,
the inverse correlation between miR-200b and E2F3
expression was also detected in tumor tissues sampled
from docetaxel-treated lung adenocarcinoma patients.
Thus, it was concluded that down-regulation of E2F3
may be a molecular mechanism by which miR-200b
exerted its functions of tumor suppressor and

chemosensitivity restorer on human lung adenocarcinoma
cells. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that activation of Aurora-A is required for mitotic entry, centrosome
maturation and separation, and G2 to M transition.43 Aurora-A overexpression could trigger chromosomal instability by dysregulating mitotic processes such as
kinetochore-microtubule dynamics monitored by the
spindle assembly checkpoint, conferring increased resistance to taxol in taxol-sensitive HeLa cells.44 The Survivin
protein was reported to inhibit caspase activation and cell
apoptosis,45 but also involved in chromosome segregation
and cytokinesis during mitosis.46 Considering the aberrant up-regulation of both the 2 genes in SPC-A1/DTX
cells compared with parental SPC-A1 cells,28 we hypothesize that dysregulation of Aurora-A and Survivin resulted
from the disequilibrium of miR-200b-E2F3 axis could
aberrantly release lung adenocarcinoma cells from docetaxel-induced G2/M phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Validation of this hypothesis is in our plan for future work.
More NSCLC cell lines and larger population of clinical
tissue samples are going to be applied. Other target genes
of miR-200b reported by our peer researchers also need to
be elucidated in future research.
Previous reports have demonstrated that activation
of the spindle assembly checkpoint was required for paclitaxel-induced cell death.47 Interestingly, a mild G2/M
phase arrest was also observed in miR-200b-transfected
A549 cells in the absence of taxanes-induced spindle assembly checkpoint activation, indicating other potential
mechanisms of miR-200b-E2F3 axis on cell cycle
regulation.
In conclusion, we have reported the altered expression of miR-200b in human lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines with different sensitivities to M-phase–specific agent
docetaxel, and have shown that miR-200b could function
as a restorer of docetaxel chemosensitivity in these cells by
targeting E2F3, which was critical for the maintenance of
normal cell cycle progression. Therefore, targeting miR200b–E2F3 interaction may be a potential strategy for
reversing docetaxel chemoresistance in human lung
adenocarcinoma.
