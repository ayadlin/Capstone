Mutant IDH1-Driven Cellular Transformation Increases
RAD51-Mediated Homologous Recombination and
Temozolomide Resistance
Shigeo Ohba, Joydeep Mukherjee, Wendy L. See, and Russell O. Pieper

Abstract
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations occur in most lower grade glioma and not only drive
gliomagenesis but are also associated with longer patient survival and improved response to temozolomide.
To investigate the possible causative relationship between these events, we introduced wild-type (WT) or
mutant IDH1 into immortalized, untransformed human astrocytes, then monitored transformation status
and temozolomide response. Temozolomide-sensitive parental cells exhibited DNA damage (g-H2AX foci)
and a prolonged G2 cell-cycle arrest beginning three days after temozolomide (100 mmol/L, 3 hours) exposure
and persisting for more than four days. The same cells transformed by expression of mutant IDH1 exhibited a
comparable degree of DNA damage and cell-cycle arrest, but both events resolved signiﬁcantly faster in
association with increased, rather than decreased, clonogenic survival. The increases in DNA damage
processing, cell-cycle progression, and clonogenicity were unique to cells transformed by mutant IDH1,
and were not noted in cells transformed by WT IDH1 or an oncogenic form (V12H) of Ras. Similarly, these
effects were not noted following introduction of mutant IDH1 into Ras-transformed cells or established
glioma cells. They were, however, associated with increased homologous recombination (HR) and could be
reversed by the genetic or pharmacologic suppression of the HR DNA repair protein RAD51. These results
show that mutant IDH1 drives a unique set of transformative events that indirectly enhance HR and facilitate
repair of temozolomide-induced DNA damage and temozolomide resistance. The results also suggest that
inhibitors of HR may be a viable means to enhance temozolomide response in IDH1-mutant glioma. Cancer

Introduction
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations are the earliest
and most common mutations in lower grade glioma (1, 2).
Mutations at the R132 codon in IDH1, and in particular R132H,
are noted in roughly 75% of all lower grade glioma (2, 3), and
more recent studies suggest that IDH mutation precedes other
alterations common to these tumors including p53 mutation in
astrocytomas and 1p/19q codeletion in oligodendrogliomas
(4, 5). The IDH1 gene encodes IDH1, which is involved in the
cytoplasmic oxidative carboxylation of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate (a-KG; ref. 6). The a-KG generated in turn contributes to
the production of NADPH in the citric acid cycle as well as to
the activity of a-KG–dependent enzymes including the 5methylcytosine hydroxylases and histone methyltransferases
that regulate the epigenetic state of the cell (7, 8). Mutations in

the IDH1 gene result in the expression of a mutant IDH1 that
has the unique ability to convert a-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate
(2HG; ref. 9). The accumulation of 2HG in mutant tumors in
turn competes with a-KG for binding and activation of a-KG–
dependent enzymes, with the result being large-scale alterations in DNA methylation, acetylation, and gene expression
that contribute to the tumorigenic process (10–12). IDH1
mutations are noted in lower grade astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and secondary
glioblastoma, but are rare in pilocytic astrocytomas and primary glioblastoma (1, 2). Furthermore, because IDH1-mutant
tumors have a very different pattern of genetic alterations than
histologically comparable IDH1 wild-type (WT) tumors (13), a
consensus has emerged that IDH1 mutation sets cells on a
different path to tumorigenesis than cells transformed by other
oncogenic insults (14, 15).
IDH1 mutational status also has consequences for therapeutic outcome. In multiple studies, IDH1 mutation correlates
with increased overall patient survival and progression-free
survival (1, 2, 4, 5, 16), implying that IDH1 mutation
alters the underlying biology of the tumor, the chemo/radiosensitivity of the tumor, or both. The DNA methylating agent
temozolomide is one of the most frequently used drugs in the
therapy of glioma, and indirectly causes DNA double-strand
breaks, which if not repaired by RAD51-driven homologous

Mutant IDH1 Confers Temozolomide Resistance

recombination (HR) lead to cell-cycle arrest and delayed cell
death (17–20). A higher rate of response to up-front temozolomide has been reported in IDH1-mutant low-grade glioma
patients relative to that noted in patients with histologically
identical IDH1 WT tumors (21), implying that mutant IDH1
contributes to temozolomide sensitivity. Gliomas driven by
IDH1 mutations, however, are widely recognized to differ in cell
of origin and underlying biology from comparable IDH WT
glioma (14, 15), complicating any analysis of the contribution of
IDH1 mutation to drug sensitivity. Furthermore, these correlative studies do not address whether mutant IDH1 alters drug
sensitivity, or merely sets in motion a series of events that lead
to tumorigenicity and altered drug sensitivity. Where examined, exogenous expression of mutant IDH1 had no signiﬁcant
effect on temozolomide sensitivity (22). The established glioblastoma cell lines used (U87 and U373MG), however, evolved
in the absence of IDH1 mutations (22) and as such may not
represent optimal models for the study of the effect of IDH1
status on drug sensitivity.
To more accurately determine whether and how IDH1
mutation alters drug sensitivity, we here employed a system
that has been widely used not only for the study of cellular
transformation and gliomagenesis, but also for the study of
IDH1 biology (12, 23, 24). This system consists of normal
human astrocytes (NHA), which are immortalized by introduction of virally-encoded E6, E7, and hTERT (23). These
immortalized cells can be transformed into cells that grow in
an anchorage-independent manner by additional expression of
oncogenic H-Ras (23), or alternatively by expression of mutant
IDH1, which has previously been shown to change patterns of
DNA methylation in a manner similar to that noted in lower
grade glioma (12, 24). We therefore used these cells to determine whether mutant IDH1 expression and/or the transformative events it sets in place were sufﬁcient to alter sensitivity
to temozolomide.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, creation of cell lines, and drug treatment
U87MG human astrocytoma cells and ductal carcinoma
T47D cells were obtained from the UCSF Brain Tumor
Research Center, and were grown in Dulbecco Modiﬁed Eagle
H-21 Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) at 37 C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. NHAs were obtained and maintained in Astrocyte
Growth Medium (Clonetics). The generation of U87 cells overexpressing MGMT and NHAs expressing E6/E7/hTERT, and
E6/E7/hTERT plus H-RasV12 (Ras astrocytes) has been
described previously (23, 25, 26). To generate IDH1-expressing
cells, lentiviral constructs encoding GFP and either WT or mut
(R132H) IDH1 (27) were cotransfected with VSVG, and DVPR
plasmids (Open Biosystems) at a 1:0.9:0.1 ratio into 293T
packaging cells using Fugene6 (Roche). Lentiviral supernatants
were harvested at 48 and 72 hours posttransfection and used to
infect U87 cells or NHAs expressing E6/E7/hTERT or E6/E7/
hTERT plus H-RasV12. After 72 hours, cells expressing GFP
were isolated by ﬂuorescent-activated cell sorting and veriﬁed
by Western blot analysis for expression of the target protein of
interest. Unsynchronized cells were pretreated with DMSO

(Sigma) or B02 (10 mmol/L, 1 hour, EMD Millipore), and then
treated with temozolomide (100 mmol/L, 3 hours; Sigma) in the
presence of drugs. The ﬁnal DMSO concentration did not
exceed 0.1% (vol/vol). After temozolomide treatment, cells
were washed, incubated in fresh medium containing DMSO
or B02 (10 mmol/L), then harvested at various time points. The
identity of all cells was veriﬁed by DNA ﬁngerprinting using the
PowerPlex 20 HS Kit and comparison with published markers
(28). All NHA-derived cultures were similarly veriﬁed to be
derived from the same parental population.
Genetic suppression of RAD51
E6/E7/hTERT/IDH1 mut cells were plated at 105/mL in
6-well plates in DMEM cell growth media without antibiotics. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected
with an optimized amount (5 nmol/L) of siRNA targeting
human RAD51 (SMARTpool, Dharmacon) or nontargeting
siRNAs as a negative control, using DharmaFECT reagent
(Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed, treated
with temozolomide (100 mmol/L, 3 hours) in complete medium
free of siRNA, washed again, and placed in temozolomide-free
medium until harvested for analysis.
Protein extraction and immunoblot analyses
Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in NP40 cell lysis
buffer (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1 PhosStop
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The protein was
quantitated and used (30 mg) for Western blot analysis using
primary antibodies against IDH1 (Dianova), IDH1R132H (Dianova), H-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RAD51 (EMD Chemicals, PC130), MGMT, or b-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies), and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody
binding was detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Cell-cycle and immunoﬂuorescence studies
At various time points following temozolomide exposure,
attached and ﬂoating cells were collected and subjected to ﬂow
cytometry and analysis using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences)
and FlowJo data analysis software (TreeStar; ref. 29). For
immunoﬂuorescence studies, cells were seeded onto 8-well
glass coverslips, incubated with temozolomide or temozolomide þ B02, washed in PBS, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS (15 minutes, room temperature), rinsed with PBS, and
blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X and 10% FBS (1 hour,
room temperature). The cells were stained with anti-Ser-139–
phosphorylated H2AX antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at
1:500 dilution followed by Alexa596-conjugated secondary
antibody (Life Technologies; 30 minutes, room temperature).
Cells were washed, counterstained with 4 V,6 V diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI), and mounted with Prolong anti-fade
reagent (Life Technologies). For RAD51 studies, cells were
incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 20% goat
serum, 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 hour), stained with
1:1000 anti RAD51 antibody in blocking solution (1 hour), then
washed in PBS and stained with 1:500 Alexa594-conjugated

secondary antibody (Life Technologies; 1hour). For double
staining, anti-Ser-139–phosphorylated H2AX antibody and
anti-RAD51 antibody (Gene Tex) were used as primary antibodies and Alexia 568 and 647 were used as secondary antibodies. The number of nuclei containing >5 g-H2AX or RAD51
foci was quantiﬁed by ﬂuorescence microscopy.
Measurement of cell viability, colony formation
efﬁciency, and in vitro transformation
Cell viability, colony formation efﬁciency, and in vitro transformation of control and temozolomide-treated cells were
determined by Trypan blue exclusion counting, colony formation assay, and soft agar assay, as previously described (23, 30).
Measurement of HR efﬁciency
HR efﬁciency was calculated using a qPCR-based HR assay
kit (Norgen Biotek Corp.; ref. 31). Brieﬂy, the system contains
two plasmids each with a different mutation in its lacZ
coding region. The plasmids were cotransfected 48 hours,
after which the total cellular DNA was isolated and used in a
qPCR reaction containing a set of universal primers that
amplify all plasmid DNA (and serve as a control for transfection efﬁciency) or a set of primers that only amplify
plasmid DNA generated by HR of the transfected plasmids.
The amount of recombinant product for each reaction was
calculated by comparing the cycle number at the point of
inﬂection of the ampliﬁcation curve generated using the HRspeciﬁc primers to that using universal primers, and converting the difference in cycle number to a DNA amount by
comparison with a standard curve generated using universal
primers and different amounts of input DNA. This value was
set at 1 in parental/vector cell populations, with the amount
of recombinant DNA produced in experimental groups
expressed as a HR ratio to this value.
Statistical analyses
Data are reported as mean  SE of at least three experiments. When two groups were compared, the unpaired Student t test was applied (P value). When multiple groups were
evaluated, the one-way ANOVA test with post hoc Turkey–
Kramer multiple comparisons test was used. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Mutant IDH1 expression changes temozolomide
response and increases temozolomide resistance
To begin to understand whether and how IDH1 mutations
inﬂuence drug sensitivity, NHAs immortalized by expression of
E6, E7, and hTERT were ﬁrst lentivirally infected with constructs encoding blank or mutant IDH1, after which the
response to temozolomide (3 hour, 100 mmol/L) was examined.
Parental blank vector E6/E7/hTERT cells are MGMT deﬁcient
(Fig. 1A, column 3) and as a result exhibited a typical pattern of
response to temozolomide. Like other MGMT-deﬁcient cells
(17, 18), they underwent a G2 arrest (here deﬁned as occurring
when the percentage of cells with 4N DNA content was greater
than that of cells with 2N DNA content) beginning 3 days after
drug exposure, and remained arrested at least 4 days following

4838

initiation of the arrest (shaded peaks, Fig. 1B). The G2 arrest
was also temporally accompanied by the appearance of
g-H2AX foci indicative of DNA double-strand breaks which
persisted for the duration of the study following a range of
temozolomide exposure (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these data,
the number of viable cells did not signiﬁcantly change between
day 4 and day 7 after temozolomide exposure (Fig. 1D) and the
temozolomide-treated cells exhibited a dose-dependent loss of
clonogenicity (Fig. 1E). Introduction of a construct encoding
WT IDH1 had no signiﬁcant effect on any of these parameters
(Fig. 1A–E). Introduction of a construct encoding mutant IDH1
(Fig. 1A) also had no signiﬁcant effect on the timing of the onset
of G2 arrest following temozolomide exposure (Fig. 1B) or the
percentage of g-H2AX–positive cells at 3 days after temozolomide (Fig. 1C). Cells expressing mutant IDH1, however,
exhibited a much shorter temozolomide-induced G2 arrest
that lasted less than 48 hours following the initiation of arrest
(Fig. 1B). Consistent with these ﬁndings, the temozolomideinduced g-H2AX foci disappeared signiﬁcantly more rapidly
(Fig. 1C) in mutant IDH1-expressing cells than in empty vector
controls. Furthermore, the number of viable cells expressing
mutant IDH1 nearly doubled between 4 days and 6 days after
temozolomide exposure (Fig. 1D), and the mutant IDH1expressing cells also exhibited increased clonogenicity relative
to uninfected or blank vector controls (Fig. 1E). These results
show that although the introduction of mutant IDH1 does not
affect the extent of temozolomide-induced DNA damage, it
signiﬁcantly alters the processing of this damage, and consequently drug action.
The effects of mutant IDH1 on drug response are not a
generalized result of cellular transformation
Tumor cells, as well as normal human cells made tumorigenic by exogenous expression of large T antigen, have both
been reported to have an increased ability to repair DNA
double-strand breaks relative to comparable nontransformed
cells (32). We therefore questioned whether the effects of
mutant IDH1 on temozolomide-induced DNA repair and drug
action were simply a consequence of mutant IDH1-driven
cellular transformation. The parental E6/E7/hTERT cells used
were immortalized, but when analyzed for growth in soft agar
(a hallmark of in vitro transformation; ref. 33) failed to form
colonies (Table 1). The same cells, however, were transformed
and readily formed colonies in soft agar after exogenous
expression of mutant V12H-Ras (Fig. 1A; Table 1). Similarly,
exogenous expression of either WT or mutant IDH1 resulted in
in vitro transformation of the parental cells, with the mutant
IDH1 cells forming fewer colonies than Ras-transformed cells,
but more than those expressing WT IDH1 (Table 1). Although
the cells expressing mutant H-Ras, WT IDH1, or mutant IDH1
were all transformed, the cells transformed by WT IDH1 were
no different than parental cells with regard to the duration of
temozolomide-induced G2 arrest (Fig. 1B), persistence of
g-H2AX foci (Fig. 1C), and temozolomide sensitivity (Fig.
1D), whereas the cells transformed by mutant H-Ras exhibited
a duration of G2 arrest and g-H2AX foci that was intermediate
between that of the parental and mutant IDH1 cells (Fig. 1B
and C) and a temozolomide sensitivity no different than

The effects of mutant IDH1 on drug response are not
mediated in a direct manner
The ability of mutant IDH1 to uniquely alter temozolomide
response suggests that expression of mutant IDH1 might
directly alter cellular mechanisms that contributed to temozolomide response. To address this possibility, a blank construct, or a construct encoding mutant IDH1 was lentivirally

Mutant IDH1-driven transformation increases HR
Temozolomide-induced DNA double-strand breaks are
repaired in human cells by the process of HR (19, 20). HR in
turn requires the collective action of a variety of proteins
including RAD51, which accumulates at the g-H2AX–marked
sites of DNA double-strand breaks and contributes to their
repair (34, 35). To ﬁrst determine whether alterations in HR
contributed to the ability of mutant IDH1-expressing cells to
escape from temozolomide-induced G2 arrest, we monitored
the formation and disappearance of RAD51 foci in temozolomide-treated E6/E7/hTERT cells lentivirally infected with a

shown in Fig. 3A, the sites of temozolomide-induced RAD51
foci formation in parental cells overlapped those of g-H2AX foci
formation 3 days following temozolomide exposure, supporting the idea that RAD51 accumulates at sites of DNA doublestrand breaks. All cell groups also exhibited similar percentages
of cells with RAD51 foci 3 days after temozolomide exposure
(Fig. 3B) mirroring the results derived from the temporal
analysis of g-H2AX foci appearance and disappearance in the
same cells (Fig. 1). Seven days after temozolomide exposure,
however, the cells expressing mutant IDH1 which had displayed fewer g-H2AX foci and had escaped from cell-cycle
arrest also were less likely to contain RAD51 foci, suggesting
that an HR-related event was stimulated in the cells expressing
mutant IDH1. To directly address this possibility, we used an in
vivo plasmid recombination-based method (31) to determine
whether exogenous expression of mutant IDH1 altered the
ability of the cells to perform HR. As shown in Fig. 3C, control

Inhibition of HR reverses the effects of mutant IDH1
expression on temozolomide resistance
Because the activity of RAD51 is critical for HR, further
studies were also performed in which RAD51 activity was
genetically or pharmacologically inhibited, after which the
levels of HR and effects on temozolomide action were measured in the mutant IDH1-expressing cells. Expression of
RAD51 siRNA, but not a scrambled control siRNA, in E6/E7/
hTERT cells expressing mutant IDH1 suppressed levels of
RAD51 by more than 85% (Fig. 4A), and also reduced HR (Fig.
4B) to levels comparable with those seen in parental E6/E7/
hTERT cells in Fig. 3C. Introduction of the RAD51 siRNA also
blocked the ability of mutant IDH1 to enhance the repair of
temozolomide-induced DNA double-strand breaks (Fig. 4C), to
shorten temozolomide-induced G2 arrest (Fig. 4D), and to
confer resistance to temozolomide (Fig. 4E).
To verify these results, similar experiments were performed
using B02, a speciﬁc inhibitor of the DNA strand exchange
activity of human RAD51 (37, 38). Incubation of E6/E7/hTERT
cells expressing mutant IDH1 with non-toxic concentrations of
B02 signiﬁcantly reduced HR in these cells to levels comparable
with those seen in control cells (Fig. 5A), signiﬁcantly reduced
the percentage of cells with RAD51 foci (Fig. 5B), and also
signiﬁcantly reduced the temozolomide resistance conferred
by mutant IDH1 overexpression (Fig. 5C). These results show
that the transformation process driven by mutant IDH1 contributes to enhanced HR and temozolomide resistance.

IDH1 had a measurable rate of HR that was signiﬁcantly less
than that of positive control T47D cells, which are known to
have a high rate of HR (36). The cells expressing mutant IDH1,
however, had a 3-fold higher rate of HR. These results show
that mutant IDH1-driven transformation increases HR.

Discussion
The overwhelming majority of low-grade glioma and secondary glioblastoma express a mutant form of IDH1, and
mutant IDH1 expression is thought to play a driving role in
the genesis of these tumors (1, 2). Because IDH1-mutant glioma
seems to be more chemosensitive than histologically identical
but genetically distinct IDH1 WT tumors, it was suggested that
IDH1 mutation conferred a degree of sensitivity to the drugs
used in the treatment of these tumors, including temozolomide. The present results show that in an extensively used
model of gliomagenesis, expression of mutant IDH1 confers
temozolomide resistance rather than temozolomide sensitivity. This drug resistance is not a direct effect of mutant IDH1
expression but rather is an indirect effect of mutant IDH1driven cellular transformation associated with changes in
RAD51-driven HR, and can be reversed by exposure to inhibitors of the HR process.
The present results differ in important ways from those of
previous studies of the effect of mutant IDH1 expression on
drug sensitivity. In previous studies, introduction of mutant
IDH1 into U87 and 373MG cells had no effect on temozolomide
resistance (22). In the present studies, introduction of mutant
IDH1 into cells transformed independently of mutant IDH1,

including U87, also did not increase temozolomide resistance.
Because expression of mutant IDH1 drives the tumorigenesis
process; however, cells transformed in an IDH1-independent
manner are not an appropriate model in which to determine
how mutant IDH1 function contributes to tumor behavior.
Although cells derived from IDH1-mutant tumors could be
used, IDH1-mutant tumor cells have proven to be extremely
difﬁcult to culture or grow as xenografts, frequently undergo
loss of mutant IDH1, and do not allow for a direct isogenic
comparison between WT and IDH1-mutant populations (39,
40). The immortalized human astrocyte cell system used in the
present studies therefore represents perhaps the only viable
approach to study the effects of mutant IDH1 expression on
drug sensitivity, particularly as in these cells the exogenous
expression of mutant IDH1 generates epigenetic alterations
similar to those noted in IDH1-mutant lower-grade gliomas
(12, 24), contributes to the transformation of the cells (12, 24),
and generates cells which when injected intracranially in mice
generate tumors which histologically resemble grade III astrocytomas (unpublished observation). In this proper context,
mutant IDH1 expression was shown to increase, rather than

decrease, temozolomide resistance, suggesting that the context in which IDH1 mutations occur are critical in determining
the effect of the alteration on drug sensitivity.
The present results also show that the effects of exogenous
mutant IDH1 on temozolomide sensitivity are not direct, but
rather are part of a larger indirect cellular reprogramming.
Exogenous expression of mutant IDH1 has been shown to alter
the concentrations of a variety of metabolites and also to change
the levels of various enzymes involved in energy regulation
(11, 12, 27, 41). Furthermore, direct mutant IDH1-driven decreases in NADPH levels have been suggested to result in
increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and drug-induced
apoptosis (42). In the present study, however, such changes were
not sufﬁcient in and of themselves to alter temozolomide
sensitivity. Rather, expression of mutant IDH1 only had effects
on temozolomide sensitivity in cells that were also transformed
by mutant IDH1. As such, the effects of mutant IDH1 on
temozolomide sensitivity seem to be a result of the action of
a larger indirect mechanism that contributes to transformation.
The results from the present studies show that expression of
exogenous mutant IDH1 increases RAD51-driven HR, which in

turn contributes to increased temozolomide resistance as well
as perhaps the transformation process itself. Although the
mutant IDH1-driven changes in HR and temozolomide sensitivity occur in the absence of changes in the protein level of
RAD51 (relative to WT IDH1 groups, not shown), a number of
proteins contribute to HR, and modulation of any or all of these
could lead to changes in the rate of HR. HR has been suggested
to contribute to genomic stability and suppression of tumorigenesis (43), and as such it is not immediately apparent why
the expression of transforming IDH1 mutants increases HR. It

is worth considering, however, that mutant IDH1 tumor cells
are typically also defective in telomere maintenance, and rely
on an alternative (ALT) mechanism rather than telomerase
upregulation to elongate their telomeres (13, 44). Because HR
has been suggested to play a role in the ALT process (45), it may
be possible that the increased HR driven by mutant IDH1
contributes to the early events required for gliomagenesis,
whereas the epigenetic alterations driven by mutant IDH1 and
2HG substitute for the frank mutations and genomic instability
that drive tumorigenesis in HR-deﬁcient cells. These possibilities remain to be examined.
From a clinical perspective, the relative chemosensitivity of
IDH1-mutant tumors has been a therapeutic bright spot, and
there has been little consideration of means to increase drug
sensitivity in IDH1-mutant tumors. The present study suggests
that the chemosensitivity of mutant IDH1 tumors may be
somewhat of an illusion, and that this sensitivity only exists
in comparison with genetically unrelated but histologically
identical IDH1 WT tumors. The present studies further suggest
that targeting components of HR, including RAD51, may be as
effective as targeting mutant IDH1 itself in increasing the
effectiveness of standard therapy. A careful examination of
the use of temozolomide, or perhaps other double-strand
break-producing agents, in combination with inhibitors of HR
might be an effective way to further improve response in IDH1mutant tumors. The better understanding of the underlying
mechanism of mutant IDH1 provided here may therefore pave
the way for better combinatorial approaches in otherwise
difﬁcult to treat lower grade gliomas.
