ABSTRACT
BRAFV600E mutation exerts an essential oncogenic function in many tumors,
including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Although BRAFV600E inhibitors are
available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism
underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAFV600E selective inhibitor vemurafenib,
we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent
BRAFV600E-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAFV600E-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also
generated an early intervention model of human BRAFV600E-PTC orthotopic mouse.
We find that metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger
migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells
as compared to BRAFWT-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further
show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions
in non-metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC cells as
compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of downregulation of tumor microenvironment–associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no
effects in BRAFWT-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that

vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAFWT/V600E-PTC mice. Importantly,
we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A
(P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC cells which are associated with
resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined
vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC
cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single
agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive
model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical
model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic
strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAFV600E-positive PTC.

INTRODUCTION

high copy number gain of MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia
sequence 1, chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A
(P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC
cells which are associated with intrinsic resistance to
vemurafenib treatment. Collectively, our PTC pre-clinical
model suggests that combination of anti-BRAFWT/V600E
therapy (e.g. vemurafenib) with inhibitors of pro-survival
molecules (i.e. pan-BCL2/MCL1 inhibitors) ameliorates
intrinsic resistance to metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC cell death.

The BRAFV600E mutation is the most common
genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)
and may be associated with progression of PTC to
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) [1, 2], one of the
most lethal human cancers [3, 4]. BRAFV600E is present
in about 61% of PTCs as recently confirmed by the PTC
TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and can be considered
to be the primary genetic hallmark of PTC [5]. PTC
patients harboring BRAFV600E mutation show resistance
to radioiodine treatment [4, 6] [7], and have higher rates
of recurrence and metastases, and lower survival rates
[8-12]. Clearly, new therapeutic options are needed for
metastatic and radioiodine-resistant thyroid cancers like
BRAFV600E-positive PTC or ATC [13, 14]. Vemurafenib is
the first orally available selective inhibitor of BRAFV600E
approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for
the treatment of BRAFV600E-melanoma [15, 16]. Although
vemurafenib has recently shown promising clinical
activity in three patients with metastatic PTC [17], its
lack of response with resistance has been frequently
observed [18] [19]. To address the unmet clinical need
in BRAFV600E-positive metastatic PTC, we have studied
the potential mechanism of loss of responsiveness to the
BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib, using a strategy referred
to as a pre-clinical trial/model. We established short-term
primary cell cultures of human thyroid samples, including
BRAFV600E-PTC samples derived from metastatic/recurrent
PTC, intrathyroidal primary PTC, and human normal
thyroid (NT). Here, we describe the development of the
first patient-derived BRAFWT/V600E-PTC in vitro and in vivo
early intervention pre-clinical model with some similar
disease molecular characteristics that are recapitulated.
More importantly, this model offers interpretative insight
into the concurrent vemurafenib human clinical trials in an
independent cohort of patients with metastatic BRAFV600EPTC, may serve to provide rapid clinical translation of
our findings. We aim to investigate somatic copy number
alterations (SCNAs) which could be associated with
metastatic BRAFWT/V600E-PTC and mechanistically render
these carcinomas resistant to the effects of BRAFWT/V600E
inhibitors (e.g. vemurafenib) on cell death. We identify

RESULTS
Vemurafenib therapy impairs viability of human
non metastatic PTC cells in a pre-clinical model of
patient-derived PTC harboring BRAFWT/V600E
We have developed the first pre-clinical model of
patient-derived PTC with BRAFWT/V600E (Figure 1A) using
BRAFWT/V600E inhibitors (i.e. vemurafenib). We established
7 short-term primary cell cultures in vitro of human PTC
(which reduce the potential for changes in vitro), including
2 from non angioinvasive and non-metastatic PTC, 2 from
angioinvasive PTC with no clinical evidence of neck
lymph node (LN) metastasis, 2 from angioinvasive PTC
with positive clinical evidence of neck LN metastasis,
and, 1 short-term cell culture from a PTC mediastinal
LN metastasis (local metastasis) (Suppl. Table 1, Suppl.
Figures 1A-B), all from individual patients with neartotal thyroidectomy with primary PTC greater than 1.1
cm (pT1b-pT3). For comparison, we also established
4 independent cultures of primary normal thyroid (NT)
cells from non-goiterous, non-thyroiditc tissue. All PTC
samples were sequenced and showed wild type TP53.
Overall, 71.4% (5/7) of the isolated PTC cell batches
harbored the heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E mutation (Figure
1B). 14.2 % (1/7) harbored the RET/PTC3 translocation
without mutations in BRAF (Suppl. Figure 1E). No
mutations included in our genomic sequencing panel
were identified in 1 of the 7 PTC samples. Additionally,
we have used KTC1 cells, a spontaneously immortalized
BRAFWT/V600E cell line established from pleural effusion

with homozygous BRAFV600E, established from a poorly
differentiated PTC. The NT cells showed no mutations.

A. Experimental design of an in vitro and in vivo model of human PTC with the BRAFWT/V600E mutation. B. DNA genotyping analysis of
human PTC identifies the heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E mutation. Mass spectrometry (MS) traces of human primary PTC cells. The intensity
of the signal versus mass of the analyte is plotted in the background. Calls are based on an expected allelic frequency of 50%. Allele
frequencies deviating from the expected values are assigned ambiguous or homozygous calls by the software. MS trace of PTC cells reveals
a heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E allele (A>T). C. In a three dimensional (3D) cell culture assay using reconstituted basement membrane
extracellular matrix (ECM) (Matrigel), BRAFV600E-PTC cells grew as larger cell aggregates. Normal thyroid (NT) cells transduced with
BRAFV600E grew as adherent refractile cells vs. NT cells engineered with empty vector (control) which grew as spindled cells. Scale bar=
400 µ, 200 µ, 400 µ and 50 µ, respectively. D. Immunocytochemistry of representative established short-term primary human PTC cells in
vitro with the heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E mutation of patient-PTC specimen (Hematoxylin-Eosin, H&E, arrows highlight nuclear clearing).
Immunocytochemistry staining in the PTC cells in vitro shows cytoplasmic to membranous staining with antibodies against PAX8, TSHreceptor, and pan-keratin (marker of tumor epithelial cells and tumor purity). Desmin immunostain was negative. Scale bars= 500 µ (1000×
magnification image) and 100 µ (400× magnification images). E. Inhibition of BRAFWT/V600E by vemurafenib reduces phospho(p)ERK1/2
protein expression levels. A parallel plate similar to F was set up and corresponding pERK1/2 protein levels (low exp= shorter exposure
during chemiluminescence reaction; high exp= longer exposure during chemiluminescence reaction) were measured from BRAFWT/V600EPTC cells, BRAFWT-PTC cells, or NT cells by western blotting. Densitometry analysis of the pERK1/2 protein levels in NT or PTC cells
treated with 10 µM vemurafenib vs. vehicle (DMSO =Dimethyl sulfoxide, control) for 24 hours, in the corresponding western blotting (*p
< 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Primary BRAFWT-NT cells have MCL1 neutral copy number, primary BRAFWT-PTC cells have MCL1 copy
number =0.9, primary non-metastatic BRAFWT/V600E-PTC1 cells have MCL1 copy number =2.14, primary BRAFWT/V600E-PTC5 cells with
angio-invasion have MCL1 copy number =3, primary BRAFWT/V600E-PTC7 cells with angio-invasion have MCL1 copy number =3, primary
LN metastatic/recurrent BRAFV600E-PTC cells have MCL1 copy number =3.8, KTC1 cells have MCL1 copy number =1.3 and BCPAP
cells have MCL1 copy number =1.4. KTC1 cells have P16 homozygous loss. For more details regarding copy number gain/amplification
(ampl.) assay see Figure 4 and Methods. These data are representative of three independent experiments. We show these results in the 5
out of 7 short-term primary human PTC cell cultures which grew well. F. Arrows highlight change of cell shape in BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells
treated with vemurafenib vs. vehicle-treated (control) PTC cells. PTC cells with heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E or BRAFWT or NT cells were
treated with 10 µM of vemurafenib or with DMSO (control) for about 24 hours. These data represent 3 independent experiments. All scale
bars are=50 µ (DMSO images) and 10 µ (Vemurafenib images). Scale bars are =50 µ (BRAFWT/WT primary PTC cells and primary human
normal thyroid cells images). G. Vemurafenib dose-reponse analysis: short-term primary human PTC or NT cells with BRAFV600E or with
BRAFWT, as well as spontaneously immortalized human PTC and ATC cells, were treated with the indicated concentrations of vemurafenib
for 48 hours, and viability was determined using the Cell Titer-Glo ATP-based luminescence assay, with DMSO-treated cells as the control.
We show these results in the 5 out of 7 short-term primary human PTC cell cultures which grew well. These data represent the average
± standard deviation (error bars) of 3-5 independent replicate measurements (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test).
H. Immunocytochemistry of representative established non-immortalized primary human PTC cells with the heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E
mutation or with BRAFWT, or NT cells. Immunohistochemistry staining shows cytoplasmic to membranous staining with antibodies against
NG2 or PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta) in BRAFWT/V600E-PTC or BRAFWT-PTC cells. OCT3/4 immunostain was
negative. Markers expression was assessed semiquantitatively using the following scoring method: 0 (negative), 1+ (1–10% positive cells),
2+ (11–50% positive cells), and 3+ (more than 50% positive cells). All scale bars are=100 µ.

PTC or NT cells with BRAFWT (Figure 1E). BRAFWT/V600EPTC cells morphology was also substantially affected
with this latter dose within 24 hours as compared to the
vehicle-treated cells (Figure 1F). By contrast, metastatic
BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells were substantially less responsive
and more resistant (IC90 for pERK1/2 protein levels was
about 30%) to vemurafenib treatment within 24 hours
(Figure 1E). The IC50 value (dose-response) for cell
viability was 5 µM for vemurafenib in representative
non-metastatic BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells at 48 hours in vitro
(Figure 1G) and was significant (p=0.001) as compared
to vehicle-treated cells, with no effect on the viability of
BRAFWT-PTC or NT cells (Figure 1G). In contrast, 10
µM vemurafenib was an effective (p=0.007) dose able to
reduce viability of BRAFWT/V600E-positive metastatic PTC or
ATC cells to about 50% vs. vehicle-treated cells (Figure
1G), with no significant effect on the viability of BRAFWTPTC or NT cells (Figure 1G). Doses greater than 1 µM
(e.g. 2 or 10 µM) have also been reported to be effective
in BRAFV600E-melanoma or ATC cells in vitro [18] [20].
Moreover, because our primary PTC cells grew as cell

pattern of these cells, we established a three-dimensional
(3D) cell-culture system with Matrigel (extracellular
matrix (ECM) in vitro) (Figure 1C). Representative
BRAFV600E-PTC cells primarily grew significantly (p=0.02)
as numerous cell aggregates (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
NT cells engineered to express mutant BRAFV600E grew
significantly (p=0.02) as refractile cells compared to
NT cells engineered with empty vector (Figure 1C).
Representative NT and PTC cells expressed some thyroid
differentiation biomarkers and epithelial tumor marker as
indicator of tumor purity, and were negative for desmin
(mesenchymal marker) (Figure 1D).
We tested the effects of vemurafenib using a doseresponse in representative PTC cells with or without
BRAFWT/V600E and in NT cells. Ten µM vemurafenib was
an effective dose to substantially block the BRAFWT/V600E
pathway, specifically reducing pERK1/2 protein
expression levels by 98% (IC90) in non-metastatic BRAFWT/
V600E
-PTC cells as compared to the same cells treated with
vehicle (control) within 24 hours and with no substantial
changes in pERK1/2 protein expression levels in either

engineered to express GFP were implanted in 10 mice. Their orthotopic tumors were evaluated by histology and green fluorescent protein
(GFP) biomaging. Either vehicle (n=5) or vemurafenib (n=5) treatment was begun at 6 day post-tumor implantation, and the response to
vemurafenib therapy was evaluated at 18 day. B. In vitro KTC1 cells engineered to express GFP. All scale bars are=400 µ.C. BRAFWT/

in the right thyroid a small and non-palpable BRAFWT/V600E KTC1 orthotopic tumor (asterisk) (vehicle treatment) and a significant decrease
of orthotopic tumor size with vemurafenib treatment (asterisk). This result was confirmed by GFP ex-vivo imaging (arrows) which shows
a significant decrease of BRAFWT/V600E KTC1 orthotopic tumor in the vemurafenib-treated SCID mice vs. vehicle-treated mice. Scale bars=
400 µ (200× magnification image) and 500 µ (1000× magnification images). D. Vemurafenib inhibits BRAFWT/V600E-positive human KTC1
orthotopic tumor growth in vivo in the early intervention mouse model described in A. Control mice with human BRAFV600E KTC1 orthotopic
tumor (H&E and GFP stain) showed tumor growth within a relatively circumscribed area, with mixed spindled and epithelioid features,
and focal areas of nuclear clearing (H&E stain, vehicle). GFP stain highlights some of the more atypical tumor cells, with prominent,
multifocal nuclear staining (arrow); vemurafenib-treated tumors (H&E and GFP stain) were small and discrete and confined to the thyroid
bed (arrow highlights GFP+ tumor cells), sometime with hyper-chromatic nuclei. Arrows and arrowhead highlight orthotopic KTC1 tumor
area, asterisk highlights mouse normal thyroid follicle. Abbreviations: H&E, hematoxylin and eosin. E. Microvascular density is reduced
after vemurafenib treatment in vivo in the orthotopic mouse model of human KTC1 tumor with BRAFWT/V600E described in A. Vehicletreated BRAFWT/V600E KTC1 orthotopic tumors had greater intratumoral staining for CD31 (arrows) (microvascular density) compared to
vemurafenib-treated (control) mice (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Microvascular density is defined by number of vessels per microscope
field showing CD31 staining. Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin (αSMA, arrows) staining as highlighted with arrows indicates the significant
reduction in vessel density in the vemurafenib-treated orthotopic tumors (2 vessels/field, arrows) vs. vehicle-treated orthotopic tumors
(8 vessels/field, p<0.01). Asterisk highlights mouse normal thyroid follicle. All scale bars are=400 µ. F. Immunohistochemical protein

vemurafenib-treated BRAFWT/V600E KTC1 orthotopic mice show a smaller tumor as highlighted by GFP labeling (arrow). Vehicle-treated
control BRAFWT/V600E KTC1 orthotopic tumors show weak and focal nuclear staining and peri-nuclear dot-like staining for pAKT (arrow)
(scoring, 1+), nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for CCNE1 (arrow) (scoring, 1+), and nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for CCNB2 (arrow)
(scoring, 1+) at day 18. BRAFWT/V600E KTC1 orthotopic tumors treated for 12 days with vemurafenib showed a decrease of pAKT, and
CCNB2 (only peri-nuclear punctate staining, scoring 0) protein levels. No significant changes were observed in CCNE1, CCNE2 (arrow)
(very low levels) or p27/kip1 (arrow) (very low levels) protein levels in the vehicle-treated BRAFWT/V600E orthotopic tumors vs. those treated
with vemurafenib. Asterisk highlights mouse normal thyroid follicle and V highlights mouse parathyroid. Immunohistochemical protein
expression was assessed semi-quantitatively using the following scoring method: 0 (negative), 1+ (1–10% positive cells), 2+ (11–50%

dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (peroxidase system) in vivo in the orthotopic mouse model of human KTC1 tumors with BRAFWT/

described in A. No significant difference was found in nuclear staining (apoptotic cells) in the vemurafenib-treated BRAFWT/V600E KTC1
orthotopic tumors at day 18 compared with vehicle (control)-treated tumors. Immunohistochemical protein expression of cleaved caspase
3: vehicle-treated control tumors (arrow highlights orthotopic tumor area) did not show cleaved caspase 3 protein expression at 18 day.
Orthotopic tumors treated with 1 week of vemurafenib therapy do not show a significant increase of cytoplasmic cleaved caspase 3 protein

controls. CD45 and F4-80 was localized to plasma membrane and PDGFRB expression was localized in the cytoplasm/plasma membrane
of spindle-shaped pericytes. No changes in CD45 and F4-80 protein levels in vehicle-treated mice vs. vemurafenib-treated mice were
observed. PDGFRB protein expression levels were higher in the peri-tumor and intra-tumor areas in the vehicle-treated mice (score 3+) vs.

(GFP). KTC1 orthotopic tumors developed in all mice
and were analyzed at 18 days post-tumor cell injection
(Figure 2C-2D). Six days after tumor cell injection,
mice were randomized for treatment with vemurafenib
(early intervention trial). Vemurafenib treatment (tumor
size mean=0.22 mm3, SD=0.2, p=0.01) by oral gavage
for 12 days resulted in a significant reduction in tumor
growth (>90%), compared with control mice treated
with vehicle (tumor size mean=4 mm3, SD=1, p=0.01).
Also, substantially decreased GFP signal suggested that
this reduction was due to suppression of BRAFV600Epositive tumor cell viability and tumor growth (Figure
2C). Importantly, we found that vemurafenib therapy
substantially down-regulated nuclear protein levels of
cyclin B2, from about 30% of tumor cells in the vehicletreated tumors to about 2% in vemurafenib-treated tumors
(Figure 2F, Supplementary information). Although
vemurafenib treatment did not significantly affect protein
levels of cleaved caspase-3, marker of apoptosis (Figure
2G), we found a significant (p=0.007) increase of about
2.5-fold human lysosomal endogenous beta-galactosidase
(β-gal, senescence marker) expression in the orthotopic
tumor cells in the vemurafenib-treated mice (Suppl.
Figure 3B) vs. vehicle-treated mice (Suppl. Figure 3A).
Because BRAFWT/V600E-positive tumors tend to be more
adhesive through ECM in the tumor microenvironment,
we performed trichrome staining which showed a
substantially abundant amount of the ECM collagen
deposition surrounding the BRAFWT/V600E-KTC1 orthotopic
tumor, and also intratumoral deposition of collagen;
more importantly, vemurafenib anti-BRAFV600E therapy
substantially decreased collagen deposition in the
orthtotopic tumors, reducing ECM density (Figure 2H).
Furthermore, vemurafenib therapy significantly (p=0.007)
reduced 2-fold vascular density (Figure 2E) and tumor
microenvironment-associated PDGFRB protein levels in
the BRAFWT/V600E-KTC1 tumor vs. vehicle-treated mice
(Figure 2I, and Supplementary information).

Figure 4H, Suppl. information), and angiogenesis (i.e.
in vitro tubule formation) (Figure 3A, Suppl. Figure 4G,
Suppl. information), suggesting activation of potential prometastatic paracrine signaling. Tubule formation decreased
(p=0.02) 1.5-3.3 fold in the presence of secretome derived
from 10 µM vemurafenib-treated metastatic/recurrent
BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells compared to vehicle-treated cells;
whereas, it was strongly inhibited from about 4-fold up to
8.6-fold in the presence of vemurafenib-treated secretome
derived from non-metastatic BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells
(Figure 3A, Suppl. Figure 4G). LEC tubule formation
strongly decreased (9.7-fold) in the presence of 10 µM
vemurafenib-treated secretome derived from BRAFWT/V600EKTC1 cells compared to vehicle-treated secretome derived
from KTC1 cells (Suppl. Figure 4G). No statistically
significant changes in tubules formation were observed in
LEC or BEC grown in the presence of secretome derived
from either BRAFWT-PTC cells or NT cells (Figure 3A,
Suppl. Figure 4F). Accordingly, we found that some proangiogenic and ECM remodeling genes showed moderate
or high mRNA expression levels in BRAFV600E-PTC cells
compared with BRAFWT-PTC or NT cells (Suppl. Table 4).
Vemurafenib treatment reduced their mRNA expression
levels compared with BRAFV600E-PTC vehicle-treated cells
(p<0.05) (Suppl. information, Suppl. Table 4).
We also used a multiplex ELISA assay that included
the most known pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic
factors. We found that LN metastatic/recurrent BRAFWT/
V600E
-PTC cells secreted significantly higher protein
levels of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g. Leptin, ~2-fold)
in vitro compared with BRAFWT-PTC cells (p=0.01)
or NT cells (p=0.01) (Figure 3B). Mechanistically, we
found that the rate of tubule suppression by the human
Leptin blocking antibody was even more potent (4.3-fold
decrease, p=0.02) when BEC were grown in the presence
of 10 µM vemurafenib-treated secretome derived from
primary metastatic/recurrent BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells
(Suppl. Figures 4J), suggesting that inhibition of both
BRAFV600E and Leptin pathways was more effective
to reduce angiogenesis in vitro. Tumor cell migration/
invasion is functionally linked to angiogenic paracrine
communication between tumor cells and stromal cells;
indeed, we also assessed microenvironment-associated
stromal cell types (Figure 3C) which participate in the
aberrant behavior of metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC cells
using a co-localization approach for PDGFRB and PAX8
(thyrocyte cell marker) proteins; we found that PDGFRB
protein levels were significantly higher (2.2-fold increase,
p=0.02) in metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC-associated stromal
cells (i.e. mesenchymal stem cell–like pericytes) compared
to BRAFWT-PTC cells in clinical samples (Figure 3C and
Supplementary information). Remarkably, vemurafenib
therapy significantly (p=0.01) reduced cell migration and
invasiveness by approximately 3.5-fold in non-metastatic
BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells in vitro as compared with vehicletreated (control) cells (Figure 3D). In contrast, metastatic/

BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells recruit microvascular
endothelial cells and pericytes by regulating proangiogenic/metastatic paracrine signaling
We sought to test the hypothesis that BRAFWT/V600E
by hyper-phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 triggers PTC
lympho-angiogenesis by means of recruitment of human
blood and lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells
(BEC and LEC, respectively) (Suppl. Figures 4A-4B) and
pericyte (Suppl. Figures 4C-4D), which are fundamental
cell populations in the tumor microenvironment. We
developed a trans-well endothelial cell migration in vitro
assay based on PTC- or NT-derived secretome (Suppl.
Figure 4A-4B) which revealed that BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cells
promoted pericytes (Suppl. Figure 4C, Suppl. information)

genomic DNA from 4 primary PTC cell cultures (3 PTC
with BRAFV600E and 1 PTC with BRAFWT), 1 primary LN

cell culture and 5 spontaneously immortalized human
thyroid cancer cells (i.e. TPC1, BCPAP, KTC1, 8505c and

(82.9%) BRAFV600E-positive samples vs. 10 of 17 (58.8%)
BRAFWT samples (including primary PTC, LN metastatic
PTC-derived specimens and primary short-term PTC cell
cultures) harbored MCL1 copy number gain (p<0.001),
and also as compared to NT tissue samples or healthy
man DNA control sample which did not show any MCL1
copy number gain (Figure 4C-4D). Eleven of 12 (91.6%)
of the primary BRAFV600E-PTC specimens with a clinical
story of LN metastasis and 9 of 9 (100%) BRAFV600EPTC LN metastatic samples in the neck or mediastinum
substantially harbored MCL1 copy number gain. Lesser
significant prevalence of MCL1 copy number gain/
amplification was found in BRAFWT-PTC LN metastatic
samples (5 of 8, 62.5%) as compared to the BRAFV600EPTC LN metastatic samples (p<0.01). Also, 4 of 5 (80%)
PTC samples with distant metastasis showed MCL1 copy

We have used a new algorithm (see methods) for
detecting somatic mutations, insertions, deletions, copy
number gain (amplifications), copy number loss, and
translocations using a targeted exome sequencing strategy.
We found significantly (p=0.0001) that chromosome 1q
(Figure 4A-4B, Suppl. Figure 7) showed SCNAs (i.e.
copy number gain) of 26 genes (Suppl. Table 3) and
chromosome 9p21.3 showed loss of the P16 gene in PTC
(Suppl. Table 2, Figure 4G, Suppl. Figure 7). Here, we
have focused our attention and validations on MCL1 (a
BCL2 protein family member) (one of the 26 genes with
copy number gains on chromosome 1), because it is a wellknown key-player in cancer progression and metastasis
[21], but has not been linked to metastatic BRAFV600EPTC. To validate this finding, we used quantitative PCR
(Figure 4C-4D) using 58 independent samples (including
22 patient-derived independent metastatic PTC clinical
samples, Suppl. Table 2, Figure 4C), in particular: 31

of the BRAFWT-PTC LN metastatic samples substantially
showed loss of P16. Six of 6 (100%) PTC samples with

copy (Figures 1E-1G). Mechanistically, based on the
vemurafenib IC50 calculations (Figure 1G) we found
that reduced doses of 2.5 µM vemurafenib or even more
effectively 5 µM vemurafenib combined with 100 nM
obatoclax significantly ameliorated therapeutic response
of angio-invasive BRAFV600E-PTC cells compared to
single agent therapy within 48 hours (Figure 5A). This
combined treatment resulted in a significant increased
cell death (sub-G1 cell accumulation, indicator of
apoptosis) detected by flow cytometry analysis by using
single agent vemurafenib (13.5-fold) or obatoclax (4.5fold) treatment compared to vehicle (Figure 5A). More
importantly, vemurafenib plus obatoclax combined
treatments significantly increased number of BRAFV600EPTC cells in sub-G1 phase (p<0.05) as compared to single
agents treatments (2.2-fold to vemurafenib and 6.8-fold to
obatoclax) or to vehicle treatment (30.7-fold) (Figure 5A).
Importantly, this combinatorial targeted treatment was also
effective to alter BRAFV600E-PTC cell shape (cells became
rounded up and detached) as compared to vehicle-treated
cells (Figure 5B).
Intriguingly, metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC derived
KTC1 cells (Figure 5C) with a lower copy number of
MCL1 (+/-) (Figure 4C) were more sensitive to single
agents treatments or more effectively to vemurafenib plus
obatoclax combined treatments compared to BRAFV600EPTC cells with a higher copy number of MCL1 (Figure
5C); as result, these cells significantly increased in
the sub-G1 phase (apoptosis) (Figure 5C) (p<0.05). In
particular, they accumulated in sub-G1 phase 24-fold by
vemurafenib (10 µM), 17.6-fold by obatoclax (100 nM),
and 97.1-fold by vemurafenib plus obatoclax treatments
compared to vehicle (Figure 5C). Furthermore, BRAFV600EPTC KTC1 cells with MCL1 (+/-) (Figure 5D) showed
more substantial alterations in cell shape as compared to
metastatic BRAFV600E-PTC cells with a higher copy number
of MCL1 (Figure 5B).

Although the lack of response to vemurafenib
has been frequently observed in different human cancer
cells lines (e.g. melanoma cells) harboring the BRAFV600E
mutation, it is still unknown in human metastatic PTC
cells. To address this unmet clinical need, we used
patient-derived BRAFV600E-positive angioinvasive PTC

DISCUSSION

BRAFV600E-PTC cells with MCL1 copy number gain are
substantially less sensitive and responsive to vemurafenib
treatment as a single agent. Consistent with our genetic
data, we critically show that combined therapy with
vemurafenib and pan-BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor decreased
viability of angioinvasive BRAFV600E-PTC cells in vitro.
This effect could be determined by the inhibition of BCL2
and MCL1 (1q) which are known to inhibit apoptosis and
maintain cancer cell survival. Co-treatment with BRAF
inhibitors and with inhibitors of BCL2 might overcome
intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors (also seen in
melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo) [28]. BCL2 inhibitors
synergize with MEK inhibitors and induce in vitro death
of murine poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma cells
[29]. Moreover, in lung cancer, reduced MCL1 expression
sensitized epidermal growth factor receptor mutant nonsmall cell lung cancers to MEK inhibitors [30]. BCL2
family inhibitors, in combination with a TORC1/2
inhibitor, lead to apoptosis in KRAS- and BRAF-mutants
but not wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer cells. This is
accompanied by suppression of MCL1 expression in
mutant, but not WT, colorectal cancers [31]. However,
BCL2 inhibitors may be toxic, and therefore, ascertaining
the correct dosage is essential.
Importantly, the recent PTC TCGA data show
chromosome 1q amplification in aggressive BRAFV600Epositive PTC [5], suggesting key role for this genomic
region in PTC behavior. PTC heterogeneity might affect
the sensitivity for detection of copy number alterations
(MCL1, P16, etc.) in some cases, with possible epigenetic
alterations of MCL1 and P16 expression levels; therefore,
we cannot exclude the possibility that the percentage
of copy number alterations for these genes might have
some variability. However, our results were substantially
validated by our integrated in vitro functional assays and
in vivo approaches.
Molecular screening for BRAF mutations, as well
as MCL1 and P16 copy number alterations might help
identify subsets of patients with PTC which have high
risk for recurrence and metastasis. They may benefit
from combined targeted therapies directed against
these alterations. This approach might provide a novel
advancement in the therapeutic strategy of aggressive
and refractory BRAFV600E-PTC for cases in which surgery
is limited by tumor location and extent of disease, or in
medically poor surgical candidates. Short-term PTC and
NT cell cultures appear to provide a novel predictive
model for evaluating therapeutic responses in patients
with PTC. Collectively, results from our PTC pre-clinical
model provide data that have value beyond predicting the
design and outcome of concurrent metastatic BRAFV600EPTC clinical trials which are using BRAFV600E inhibitors
(e.g. vemurafenib therapy) and also identify potentially
biomarkers (e.g. MCL1 copy number gain, loss of P16)
for aggressive PTC.

The pre-clinical trial model for cancer treatment may
very well facilitate our ability to combat human cancer [1,
7, 22-27]. Here, we report the first patient-derived preclinical model of PTC with BRAFV600E or BRAFWT, or NT
using anti-BRAFV600E therapy. Although primary NT or
PTC cell survival in culture is limited, the benefit is that
primary cells show low likelihood of adopting cellular and
molecular changes in vitro.
Our results raise the concern that primary/intrinsic
resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitors (i.e. vemurafenib) could
occur at or near the acquisition of metastatic capability
by BRAFV600E-PTC. Critically, our experimental models
identify that genomic co-occurrence of BRAFV600E mutation
with either MCL1 copy number gain (chromosome 1q)
or P16 (chromosome 9p) loss is functionally associated
with metastasis in patients with PTC and patients should
be closely monitored for disease recurrence. This paired
genomic abnormality could confer primary/intrinsic
resistance to vemurafenib therapy, possibly through
activation of BRAFV600E parallel signaling pathways
regulated by either MCL1 or P16 in metastatic PTC
cells. Furthermore, abundance of MCL1 (pro-survival
factor) or loss of P16 (tumor suppressor) protein and
mRNA levels functionally correlated with their genomic
abnormalities. MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic member of the
BCL2 family and is known to be focally amplified in
about 10.9% of cancers across multiple tissue types (e.g.
breast cancer, lung cancer, etc.) and to increase tumor cell
survival [21]. MCL1 is also amplified in melanoma cells
[28]. Our orthotopic mouse model of tumor harboring
the heterozygous BRAFV600E mutation along with MCL1
and P16 copy number alterations showed focal PTClike nuclear features (i.e. clearing), suggesting that this
mouse model may be a helpful translational tool for
in vivo pre-clinical testing of anti-BRAFV600E therapy,
although these tumor cells (i.e. KTC1 cells) showed in
vivo mixed spindled and epithelioid features which are
not characteristic of PTC. Vemurafenib therapy did not
elicit expression of pro-apoptotic markers in the orthotopic
tumor cells; interestingly, tumor cell senescence increased
with concomitant tumor size reduction via suppressed
pro-survival molecules. Moreover, our analysis of tumor
microenvironment both in our orthotopic tumors and in
PTC clinical samples provides evidence that metastatic
BRAFV600E-PTC with MCL1 and P16 copy number
alterations are enriched with PDGFRB-positive stromal
cells (i.e. pericyte). Additionally, BRAFV600E-positive
PTC cell might synergize with pericytes and sustain the
viability via expression and secretion of factors crucial
for angioinvasion and angiogenesis. Furthermore, our in
vitro data indicate that BRAFV600E might regulate PTC
cell migration/invasion and viability, and its inhibition by
vemurafenib may induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in non-metastatic PTC cells. In contrast, metastatic

MATERIALS AND METHODS

FFPE discarded/unidentified samples from 4 independent
patients (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC)
IRB-approved exemption 4 protocol, Boston); (ii) 2
primary PTC cell cultures with BRAFV600E, 1 mediastinal
LN metastatic PTC cell culture with BRAFV600E, 1
primary PTC cell culture with BRAFWT and 1 primary
NT cell culture; and (iii) 3 spontaneously immortalized
human thyroid cancer cells (8505c, BCPAP and KTC1,
see cell cultures paragraph for more details). Briefly,
30 µm paraffin sections were lysed in denaturing buffer
containing proteinase K (1 mg/ml) (Invitrogen, USA)
during overnight incubation at +55°C. DNA was purified
using equal volumes of a phenol:chloroform mixture
(Invitrogen, USA) and eluted in distilled water. Genomic
DNA was quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA
Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA) per manufacturer protocol.
250 ng of genomic DNA was used for mutation detection
through Oncomap version 3, which interrogates about
1000 known mutations (including the BRAFV600E mutation)
in 112 validated oncogenes and tumor suppressors
[34]. All genomic analyses were run in the Center for
Cancer Genome Discovery (CCGD, Dana Farber Cancer
Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,
USA) [34]. Primers and probes were designed using
Sequenom MassARRAY Assay Design 3.0 software,
applying default multi-base extension parameters. Whole
genome amplification (WGA) was performed using the
GenomePlex Complete WGA kit (Sigma, USA) based
on chemical fragmentation followed by adapter mediated
PCR amplification. Samples were run on the mass
spectrometry-based genotyping platform (Sequenom) and
analyzed according to current standardized protocols [34].
Sample identity and the possible introduction of artifacts
by WGA were evaluated using a 48 Single Nucelotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs) panel comparing the pre-WGA
to the post-WGA DNA. If ≥3 SNP discrepancies were
identified between SNPs found in pre- and post-WGA
samples, this sample was discarded. Validations were
performed using homogeneous and sensitive Mass Extend
(hME) sequenom, a multi-base extension chemistry
performed on native unamplified genomic DNA [34].
For all patients, we used discarded/unidentified tissue
specimens and consent for genotyping test.

Histology and immunohistochemistry
Histopathology evaluation of 7 classical type PTC
(4 PTC with BRAFV600E and 3 PTC with BRAFWT), 3 neck
LN metastatic PTC samples harboring BRAFV600E (n=3)
and 3 NT tissues was performed by pathologists (P.S. and
V.N.) on hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. For all patients
we used discarded and unidentified tissues (Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) IRB-approved
exemption 4 protocol, Boston). All tissue specimens
were fixed with 10% buffered formalin phosphate and
embedded in paraffin blocks. These were visualized
with an Olympus BX41 microscope and the Olympus Q
COLOR 5 photo camera (Olympus Corp., Lake Success,
NY, USA). Four µm sections of PTC or BRAFV600Epositive human KTC1 tumor-derived orthotopic mouse
tissues (serial sections) were used for IHC. After baking
overnight at +37°C, deparaffinization with xylene/ethanol
and rehydration was performed. IHC analysis utilized
primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 5). The sections,
treated by pressure cooker for antigen retrieval (Biocare
Medical, Concord, CA), were incubated at 123°C in
citrate buffer (Dako Target Retrieval Solution, S1699;
DAKO Corp.), cooled and washed with PBS. Antigen
retrieval was performed for 60 min at room temperature.
The primary antibody was detected using a biotin-free
secondary antibody (K4011) (Dako Envision system)
and incubated for 30 min. All incubations were carried
out in a humid chamber at room temperature. Slides were
rinsed with PBS between incubations. Sections were
developed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Sigma Chemical
Co.) as a substrate and were counterstained with Mayer’s
hematoxylin [1] [32] [33]. The IHC marker expression was
assessed semiquantitatively using the following scoring
method: 0 (negative), 1+ (1–10% positive cells), 2+
(11–50% positive cells), and 3+ (more than 50% positive
cells). Microvascular density is defined by number of
vessels per microscope field showing CD31 (marker of
blood endothelial cells) or D2-40 (Podoplanin) (marker of
lymphatic endothelial cells) staining. Trichrome staining
was performed according to manufacturer instructions
(Ventana, USA) in order to assess collagen deposition in
the ECM of PTC.

Sanger sequencing and SNaPshot mutational
analysis
PCR products were generated and sequenced for
the BRAFV600E mutation screening according to previous
protocols [35, 36]. SNaPshot analysis covered a broad
panel of mutations including the BRAFV600E and was
performed according to Dias-Santagata et al. [37].

Genotyping oncomap analysis and mass extend
sequenom
Genomic DNA was extracted using our previous
protocol [21] from overall 13 samples from independent
patients, which include: (i) 2 BRAFV600E-PTC, 1 BRAFWTPTC, 1 mediastinal LN metastatic PTC and 1 NT available

Targeted exome sequencing

CEPH (Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain;
http://www.cephb.fr/) as reference. SCNAs were called
with the following next generation sequencing (NGS)
settings: significant threshold = 1E-6; max contiguous
probe spacing or 1000 Kbp; minimum number of probes
per segment = 3. SCNA gains has a log ration >0.4 and
were called high gain if >0.8. Single copy loss threshold
was -0.6 and big loss was -1.2. SCNA’s on chromosomes
X and Y were not called.

OncoPanel version 2 (OPv2) represents a recent
targeted exome sequencing strategy (developed
from the CCGD, DFCI, Harvard Medical School) to
simultaneously detect mutations, insertions, deletions,
translocations and SCNAs. We analyzed 13 samples from
independent patients, in particular from: 2 BRAFV600EPTC, 1 BRAFWT-PTC, 1 mediastinal lymph node (LN)
PTC metastasis and 1 NT available FFPE discarded/
unidentified samples from 4 independent patients (Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) IRB-approved
exemption 4 protocol, Boston); as well as we analyzed
genomic DNA from 2 primary PTC cell cultures with
BRAFV600E, from 1 mediastinal LN metastatic PTC cell
culture with BRAFV600E from 1 primary PTC cell culture
with BRAFWT and from 1 NT cell culture. Additionally,
we analyzed DNA from 3 spontaneously immortalized
human thyroid cancer cells (8505c, BCPAP and KTC1
see cell cultures paragraph for more details). Targeted
sequencing was achieved by designing RNA baits to
capture the exons of 504 genes with relevance to cancer.
The bait set was augmented with specific intronic
sequences to also detect translocations often involved in
cancer. Sequencing libraries were prepared, as previously
described in Hettmer et al. [38], starting from 100 ng of
genomic DNA. Libraries were quantified by qPCR (Kapa
Biosystems, Inc, Woburn, MA) and pooled in equimolar
concentrations to 500 ng total and enriched for the OPv2
bait set using the Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture
kit. The enriched targeted exon libraries were again
quantified by qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, Inc, Woburn,
MA) subsequently sequenced in one lane of a Hiseq2000
sequencer (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) in a 2× 100 bp
pair-end mode. Sequence alignment, demultiplexing and
variant calling, including SCNAs and Indels (insertionsdeletions) were performed using PICARD (HTSJDK Java
library HTSJDK, BROAD Institute, Cambridge, MA,
USA), GATK tools, Mutect and IndeLocator as previously
described in Hettmer et al. [38]. Common variants were
filtered against the 6,500 exome release of the Exome
Sequencing Project (ESP) database. Variants represented
in either the African-American or European-American and
not in COSMIC > 2× were considered to be germline. The
ESP filter was only applied to tumor samples that did not
have a matched normal DNA sample.

Translocations analysis
Translocations (rearrangements) were detected by
Breakmer, an algorithm that was specifically developed
for targeted sequencing by the CCGD (DFCI, Harvard
Medical School). Briefly, the method identified the reads
that partially aligned to the targeted regions captured and
sequenced. The unaligned portion of these ‘soft-clipped’
reads was used to assemble contigs. The contigs were
aligned to the reference genome, and structural variants
were called based on the alignment. For translocation
events, discordantly mapped paired-end reads were
identified which flank putative breakpoints.

Validations of MCL1 and P16 SCNAs
Genomic DNA was extracted using our previous
protocol [21] from either 58 (for MCL1 copy number
assays, see below) or 51 (for P16 copy number assays,
see below) FFPE archived clinical samples; in details,
for MCL1 copy number assays we used: 31 PTC (23
BRAFV600E-PTC and 8 BRAFWT-PTC), 17 LN metastatic
PTC (9 BRAFV600E-LN and 8 BRAFWT-LN), 5 distant
metastatic samples from patients with PTC (1 from lungs,
1 from bone and 3 from adrenal glands), and 5 NT; and 1
control sample from healthy man (human male genomic
DNA from Promega, USA). For P16 copy number assays
we used: 27 PTC (19 BRAFV600E-PTC and 8 BRAFWT-PTC),
15 LN metastatic PTC (7 BRAFV600E-LN and 8 BRAFWTLN), 6 distant metastatic samples from patients with PTC
(2 from lungs, 1 from bone and 3 from adrenal glands), and
4 NT; and 1 control sample from healthy man. Moreover,
our SCNAs analyses also included genomic DNA from 4
primary PTC cell cultures (3 PTC with BRAFV600E and 1
PTC with BRAFWT), 1 primary LN metastatic BRAFV600EPTC cell culture, 1 primary NT cell culture and 5
spontaneously immortalized human thyroid cancer cells
(i.e. TPC1, BCPAP, KTC1, 8505c and SW1736). MCL1
and P16 SCNAs analysis was respectively performed in 22
or 21 patient-derived independent metastatic PTC clinical
samples (Suppl. Table 2). DNA quality (260/280 ratio)
and concentration (ng/µL) were assessed by NanoDrop
(ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fischer Scientific
Inc, MA, USA); or assessed by Qubit 2.0 fluorometer
(Invitrogen-Life Tech., Inc., USA) using the double-

Somatic copy number alteration analysis
Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) analysis
was performed using Nexus7.1 (BioDiscovery Inc.,
USA) after calculating the sequencing coverage using
PICARD. Coverages were normalized over GC-content
using a loess regression and DNA derived from normal
and immortalized cultured lympho-blastoid cells by the

stranded DNA broad range assay kit (Invitrogen-Life
Tech., Inc., USA). Samples were then diluted in order to
generate uniform DNA concentrations (5 ng/µL or 20 ng/
μL per replicate/reaction). For the duplex real-time PCR
reaction, we used a TaqMan based copy number assay
specific for: (i) MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence
1, gene aliases: BCL2L3, EAT, MCL1-ES, MCL1L,
MCL1S, Mcl-1, TM, bcl2-L-3, mcl1/EAT) (NCBI location:

(Life Technologies, USA, assay ID: Hs00237642_cn,
cat#4400291) in 51 samples for which there was sufficient
DNA available. We also used the copy number reference
assay human RNAase-P (Life Technologies, USA, cat#
4403326). Briefly, each 5 µL reaction mixture was run in a
384-well plate with 4 replicates per sample each containing
2.5 µL Universal Master Mix II, no UNG, (catalog
#4440040, Life Technologies, USA), 0.25 µL copy number
reference assay RNAase-P, 0.25 µL copy number assay for
MCL-1 or CDKN2A, and 2 µL DNA sample at 2.5 ng/µL.
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
was utilized as an additional reference gene. Each 5 µL
reaction mixture contained 2.5 µL Universal Master
Mix II, no UNG, 0.1 µL of 10 µM forward primer
(5’-CCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAAAA-3’), 0.1 µL of 10
µM reverse primer (5’-CTCCGACGCCTGCTTCAC-3’)
according to Li et al. [39], 0.1 µL of 10 µM GAPDH
probe (5’-FAM-CTGCCAAATATGATGACATCAAGABHQ-3’) (Integrated DNA Technologies, USA), 0.2 µL
DNAse/RNAse free water and 2 µL DNA sample at 2.5
ng/µL. The target and reference copy number assays
were run in a duplex on Bio-Rad Real-Time PCR System
(CFX Connect™ Real-Time PCR Detection System,
BioRad, USA) or using the 7900HT Real-Time PCR
system (Life Technologies, USA) with the program as
10 minutes polymerase activation at 95°C followed by
40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute.
The Real-Time PCR data were imported to CopyCallerTM
Software v2.0 (Life Technologies, USA) for comparative
Ct (ΔΔCt) relative quantification analysis using a control
sample (Human Male Genomic DNA from Promega,
USA) with assumed 2 copies (diploid DNA) of target
gene in the following equation: copy number = cnc2–
ΔΔCt
. Cnc is the copy number of the target sequence (i.e.
MCL1) in the calibrator sample (human male genomic
DNA); ΔCt is the mean difference between Ct of target
assay (MCL1) and reference assay (GAPDH or RNase-P);
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and ΔΔCt is the difference between ΔCt for the tested
sample and the calibrator sample. We used the following
threshold similarly to previous studies [40] [41] for the
copy number gain/amplification assay and classified as
low-level, moderate-level and high-level amplification,
specifically as follows: normal copy number (1.85-2.15
fold), heterozygous deletion (0.90-1.84 fold), homozygous
deletions (below 0.9 fold), gain (2.16-2.39 fold), low-level
amplification (2.4-3.9 fold), moderate-level amplification
(4-9.8 fold) and high-level amplification (greater than 9.8
fold) according to the distributions in reference to normal
samples with diploid DNA. Assays were performed at
least in duplicate.

Cell cultures
Primary human PTC or NT cells were derived
according to procedures used in previous studies [42]
[43] from 0.1 to 1 gram excess fresh PTC tissue, or
normal fresh thyroid tissue from patients undergoing
thyroidectomy (IRB approved for AF). Briefly, we have
adopted some changes in the protocol [42] [43] using 1:1
DMEM:Ham’s F12 (Corning, USA) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). We cut tissue into 1 mm3 in a sterile petri
dish with cold Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (calcium and
magnesium free) (HBSS) (Fischer Scientific, MA, USA).
We transferred minced tissue to a 50 ml tube with HBSS.
We decanted supernatant red cells. Tissue was digested
in a solution with clostridium collagenase (100 U/ml)
and Dispase (1 mg/ml) (Stem Cell Technologies, USA)
in HBSS or in 1:1 DMEM:Ham’s F12 growth medium
with no serum (Corning, USA) for 1.5 hours at 37C in
a humidified tissue culture incubator with 5% C02. We
filtered the remaining completely digested tissue and
pooled supernatants through a 70 micron cell strainer
(BD Falcon, USA). We rinsed the strained material
with 5 ml of HBSS to maximize yield. This straining
step is important to help remove fibroblasts and blood
vessels. We spun down the filtered cells at low speed
and resuspended them in 1:1 DMEM:Ham’s F12 with
10% FBS plus ampicillin/streptomycin antibiotic and
antimycotic solution 100× (Corning, USA) for seeding at
about 1×105 cells per mL on plastic petri dishes. PTC cells
digest faster than NT cells, and adhere relatively poorly
to glass or plastic. Cell viability was generally high and
cytokeratin staining confirmed >99% of adherent cells
are epithelial using this method. PTC genomic status
was determined by genomic sequencing (IRB approved
for CN). Thyroid and epithelial cell IHC markers were
validated in previous studies [23]. Human microvascular
endothelial cells (human blood endothelial cells (BEC)
and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC)) were kindly
provided from Dr. Harold F. Dvorak (BIDMC, Harvard
Medical School, Boston, USA). Pericytes were obtained
from Promo Cell (Heidelberg, Germany). Primary PTC or
NT cells were grown in 1:1 DMEM:HAM’s F12 (Corning,
42461

Oncotarget

Vemurafenib preparation

USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and ampicillin/
streptomycin antibiotic and antimycotic solution 100×
(Corning, USA). BEC and LEC were grown in EGM2
bullet kit (Lonza, USA) growth medium with 10% FBS.
We used the following spontaneously immortalized human
thyroid cancer cells: TPC-1 (PTC, harboring RET/PTC-1
and BRAFWT) was provided by Dr. F. Frasca (University
of Catania, Italy); the BCPAP cells which harbor the
homozygous BRAFV600E mutation were established from
the primary tumor of a 76-year-old woman with poorly
differentiated PTC [44] and provided by Dr. G. Damante
(University of Udine, Italy); the KTC1 cells which harbor
the heterozygous BRAFWT/V600E mutation were established
from the metastatic pleural effusion from a recurrent and
radioiodine (RAI) refractory PTC in a 60-year-old male
patient [45] by Dr. J. Kurebayashi (Department of Breast
and Thyroid Surgery Kawasaki Medical School Kurashiki,
Japan) and provided by Dr. Rebecca E. Schweppe
(University of Colorado, USA); and the 8505c (ATC)
cells harboring the hemizygous/homozygous BRAFV600E
mutation were purchased from DSMZ (German collection
of microorganisms and cell culture, Braunschweig,
Germany) [24, 46]. These human thyroid cancer cells were
validated by genomic/genotyping analyses (e.g. BRAFV600E
mutation analysis, see above) and were grown in high
glucose DMEM (Corning, USA) medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and plus ampicillin/streptomycin antibiotic
and antimycotic solution 100× (Corning, USA). All in
vitro assays were performed by growing PTC or NT cells
in growth medium supplemented with 0.2% FBS. The
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line was kindly
provided by Dr. Laura E. Benjamin (ImClone Systems,
NYC, USA) and grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and plus ampicillin/streptomycin antibiotic and
antimycotic solution 100× (Corning, USA).

Vemurafenib (PLX4032, RG7204) (Roche, NYC,
USA) was dissolved in absolute dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, vehicle) (Sigma, USA) to achieve a stock
concentration of 10 mM for in vitro assays. Ten mM was
diluted to 2 mM in absolute DMSO; then, vemurafenib
intermediate doses were diluted in 0.2% FBS high
glucose DMEM in order to achieve final concentrations
of 0.01 µM, 0.1 µM, 1 µM, 2.5 µM, 5 µM, and 10 µM
vemurafenib at 2% DMSO for optimal vemurafenib
solubility. Vehicle was 2% DMSO diluted in 0.2%
FBS high glucose DMEM. For in vivo studies, a drug
suspension was prepared from micro-precipitated bulk
powder (MBP) by suspending the drug to a concentration
of 25 mg active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)/mL in a
2% solution of hydroxypropylcellulose (vehicle) (Sigma,
USA), according to manufacturer instructions. Freshly
prepared drug suspensions were stored at 4°C and used
within 24-48 hours. Mice were dosed twice daily (8 hours
apart) with vehicle alone (control) or with vemurafenib
suspensions at 100 mg/kg using an 18G oral gavage
needle.

Obatoclax mesylate
Obatoclax
[29]
also
named
GX15-070
(Selleckchem, USA) is an inhibitor of the BCL2 proteins
family (which it does also include MCL1), was dissolved
in absolute DMSO (Sigma, USA) according to the
manufactures instructions and then used at 2 nM, 10 nM,
20 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM and 1 µM diluted in 0.2% FBS
high glucose DMEM at final 2% DMSO. Combinatorial
treatments of vemurafenib plus obatoclax were calculated
based on the vemurafenib IC50 values using a decrease of
the highest dose (i.e. 10 µM) of vemurafenib, specifically
we combined 5 µM or 2.5 µM vemurafenib along with 2
nM, 10 nM, 20 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM or 1 µM obatoclax.
All compounds (single agents or combined treatments)
were diluted in 0.2% FBS high glucose DMEM at final
2% DMSO. Vehicle was 2% DMSO diluted in 0.2% FBS
high glucose DMEM.

Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures assays
In 3D cell cultures, growth of PTC cells resulted
in formation of cell aggregates (e.g. spheroids) that
recapitulate some aspects of the in vivo ECM. Using this
assay in human breast carcinoma models, it was shown
that oncogenes during steps of tumor progression could
elicit aggressive cell phenotype [47]. 3D cell cultures were
prepared as follows: 4×103 or 20×103 cells were suspended
in high glucose DMEM growth media supplemented
with 10% FBS and seeded on growth factor-reduced
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) in 24-well petri dishes.
Phase-contrast images (10× and 20× magnification)
were captured using a microscope (Nikon TE300, USA)
equipped with a camera (Leica DFC 350 FX, USA).

Cell viability
Human PTC or NT cells (1×103 cells/well) were
cultured in growth medium containing 0.2% FBS
(CellGro, USA) in a 96-well sterile culture plate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA). Cells were treated with or
without various concentrations of vemurafenib for 48
hours. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiterGlo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega, USA).
The IC50 (50% maximal inhibitory concentration) for cell
viability was determined using the following doses of

from dead cell debris by short spin, diluted 1:3, and then
secreted VEGFA, FGFβ, EGF, Leptin, TNFα, IL6, IGF1, TGFβ (protein levels, pg/mL) were determined by
ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent) assay (Signosis,
CA, USA) according to manufacturer instructions. TSP1 protein levels were also determined by ELISA assay
(R&D Systems, MN, USA) according to manufacturer
instructions. Growth medium was measured by ELISA to
subtract background and normalize all samples. Protein
levels were also normalized to total protein content (µg/
µL).

Cell transfections for lentivurs or retrovirus
production
HEK 293T cells (5 ×105) were grown in 60mm plates and transfected using Fugene-6 (Roche)
in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) for 48 hours according to
manufacturer instructions.

Over-expression technique

Cell cycle analysis
HIV-U6-GFP GL3B lentivirus which expresses
GFP (green fluorescent protein) was kindly provided from
Dr. Yutaka Kawakami (Division of Cellular Signaling,
Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University
School of Medicine, Japan). BRAFV600E-pBABE-puro and
pBABE-puro (empty vector) retroviral constructs were
kindly provided by Dr. W.C. Hahn (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston) and used for
BRAFV600E over-expression studies in NT cells. Either
lentiviral or retroviral infections (viral transductions)
were performed as follows: HEK 293T cells were seeded
in 60-mm dishes and cotransfected the next day with each
lentivirus or retrovirus and helper plasmids (i.e., gag-pol
and VSV-G were used only for lentiviral infections and
provided by Dr. W.C. Hahn). Both pBABE retroviral
constructs were similarly packaged using helper plasmid
pCL-ampho provided by Dr. W.C. Hahn. Media with
progeny virus from transfected HEK 293T cells were
collected 48 hours later and filtered with 0.45 μm filters
(Millipore) and freshly used to transduce KTC1 cells
for 3–6 hours in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene
(Sigma). All cells used were transduced at a multiplicity
of infection of either 50 or 100. Finally, stable transduced
cells with HIV-U6-GFP GL3B were selected and sorted
by flow cytometry (MoFlo/FACSAria Sorting; Beckman
Coulter); and NT cells transduced with pBABE-puro
retroviral constructs were treated with puromycin (1 μg/
mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) for selection. BRAFV600E overexpression in the cells were confirmed by real-time
RT-PCR according to Nucera et al. [1]. All assays were
performed in duplicate.

PTC-derived cells were cultured at about 60-80%
confluence in 6-well dishes in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or
high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS then
treated with 10 µM vemurafenib, 100 nM obatoclax,
combination of 5 µM vemurafenib plus 100 nM obatoclax,
or vehicle for 48 hrs in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or high
glucose DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS.. After 48
hours, adherent cells were trypsinized and pelleted with the
supernatant. Cell pellets were fixed in pre-chilled (−20°C)
ethanol 75%, pelleted at 400 × g at room temperature,
suspended in 0.5% PBS/BSA, incubated in 2M HCl 0.5%
BSA for 20 min at room temperature, washed with 0.5%
PBS/BSA, and centrifuged 5 minutes at 400 × g at room
temperature. The cells were suspended in 0.1M sodium
borate (pH 8.5) for 2 min at room temperature, washed
with 0.5% PBS/BSA, and centrifuged 5 min at 400 × g at
room temperature. Finally, the cells were pelleted, washed
twice with 0.5% PBS/BSA, and suspended in 500 μL of
this solution. Propidium iodide (Sigma) was added to a
final concentration of 10 μg/mL with RNase 10 mg/mL
(Sigma). Cells were incubated at room temperature for 30
minutes and then analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACS
Gallios (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).

PTC-derived cells were cultured at about 60-80%
confluence in 6-well dishes in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or
high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS then
treated with 10 µM vemurafenib, 100 nM obatoclax,
combination of 5 µM vemurafenib plus 100 nM obatoclax,
or vehicle for 48 hrs in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or high
glucose DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS.. After 48
hours, adherent cells were trypsinized and pelleted with
the supernatant. Cell pellets were fixed in pre-chilled
(−20°C) ethanol 75% for propidium iodide staining
and flow cytometry analysis a FACS Gallios (Beckman
Coulter, Miami, FL, USA) to evaluate sub-G1 cell
population (apoptosis).

ELISA
PTC or NT cells were cultured at about 80%
confluence in 6-well dishes in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or
high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and
then treated with 10 μM vemurafenib or vehicle for 24
hrs in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or high glucose DMEM
supplemented with 0.2% FBS. After 24 hours, the growth
medium enriched with PTC or NT cell-derived growth/
angiogenic factors (secretome) was collected, removed

four fields were chosen per well with two well per each
condition.

Cells were cultured at about 90% confluence in
6-well dishes in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or high glucose
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and then treated
with 10 μM vemurafenib or vehicle for 24 hrs in 1:1
DMEM/Ham’s F12 or high glucose DMEM supplemented
with 0.2% FBS. After 24 hours, adherent cells were lysed
along with the pelleted supernatant. Western blotting
assays were performed according to a standard procedure,
and the protein lysis buffer was composed of 10 mM
Hepes (pH 7.40), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 5 mM sodium flouride,
and 1% Triton X-100; protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Pierce) were used for protein extractions [1]. The
intensity of the bands was quantified with a densitometer
(Quantity One 1-D analysis software, Bio-Rad, USA).
The quantity of signal in the vemurafenib lane was
divided by the signal of the vehicle (control) lane in the
corresponding tubulin or β-actin blot lane. The assessment
of the 90% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC90) of
ERK1/2 phosphorylation was performed by densitometry
comparing phospho-ERK1/2 protein expression levels
upon 10 µM vemurafenib treatment vs. vehicle (control)
treatment by densitometry. We used the following
antibodies: pERK1/2 (cat#9101, Cell Signaling, USA),
total-ERK1/2, (cat#9102, Cell Signaling, USA), and betaactin or tubulin (Sigma, USA).

In vitro angiogenesis assay
In vitro angiogenesis assays were performed as
previously described [48] [46]. In brief, BEC or LEC (4080×103 cells) (with starvation overnight at 1% serum) were
suspended in NT or PTC-derived secretome treated with
vehicle or vemurafenib (10 µM) for 24 hours and seeded
on growth factors-reduced Matrigel (cat#354230, BD
Biosciences, USA) in 24-well petri dishes. The secretome
derived from the PTC or NT cells was utilized to induce
tube (tubule)-like structures formation (Supplementary
Figure 4B). After about 6-8 hours of incubation, cells
were photographed. The number of tubes was counted
using a 10× or 20× objective and four fields were chosen
per well with two wells per each condition. Human Leptin
blockage was performed using an antibody against Leptin
(cat#AF398, R&D Systems, MN, USA).

Quantitative multigene
expression analysis

mRNA

The expression of EMC and angiogenesis genes was
validated by multi-gene transcriptional profiles provide a
quantitative view of the expression of many genes [49].
Cells were seeded at about 60-80% confluence in 6-well
dishes and grown in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F12 or high
glucose DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS. After 24
hours, RNA isolation was performed by Quiagen columns
(Quiagen, USA) following manufacturer protocols.
Quantitative multi-gene profiling was performed
by absolute quantification using real-time reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) according to Shih et al. [49].
Primer sequences used for the validation of human genes
are reported in Supplementary Table 6. We classified gene
expression as ‘low copy number’ if it was below 1 mRNA
copy/106 18S copies, ‘moderate copy number’ if it was
between 1 and 15 mRNA copies/106 18S copies, and ‘high
copy number’ if it was greater than 15 mRNA copies/106
18S copies. Genes showing differences in relative
values of comparisons (p values <0.05) were considered
differentially expressed.

Cell invasion and migration assays
Cell invasion assays were performed using 24well BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers according to
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences, USA). These
chambers were used to study the effect of vemurafenib
or vehicle on the invasion of PTC or NT cells (8×103 or
25×103 cells/assay) for about 20 hours in culture. Invasion
assay was performed in a serum free growth medium and
we used 5% FBS as chemo-attractant agent. Migration
assay was performed using: 3×103 or 25×103 PTC or NT
cells/assay, 6×103 or about 25×103 pericytes/assay, 30100×103 BEC or LEC/assay loaded into the migration
chamber (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) and
grown for a range of 3-12 hours in culture. PTC or NT
cell migration assay was performed in a serum free growth
medium and we used 5% FBS as chemo-attractant agent.
The secreted pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic factors
(secretome) derived from the human PTC with or without
BRAFWT/V600E or from NT cells treated with vehicle (2%
DMSO) or vemurafenib (10 µM) for 24 hours was utilized
as chemo-attractant conditioning medium (CM) to induce
endothelial cell migration (Supplementary Figure 4A).
Migrated or invaded cells were quantified in all assays
as described: cells were counted (number of cells/field or
number of cells/well) using a 10× or 20× objective, and

Orthotopic mouse model
All animal work was done in accordance with
federal, local, and institutional guidelines at the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA). Human
metastatic KTC1 tumor-derived cells harboring the
heterozygous BRAFV600E mutation engineered to express
GFP were cultured in 10-cm dishes and grown in high
glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS,

penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin at 37°C with
5% CO2 atmosphere. On the day of tumor implantation, the
cells were trypsinized, gently centrifuged, and suspended
in serum-free high glucose DMEM growth medium to
achieve a cell suspension concentration ranged between
3×106 cells and 5×106 cells/10 µL. The cells were kept
on ice until implantation. KTC1 cells were orthotopically
injected using a Hamilton syringe (Fischer, MA, USA) in
the right thyroid of 9 weeks old male NOD SCID gamma
mice (strain name: NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ; stock
number: 005557) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor,
Maine, USA) (BIDMC IRB, Boston) (n=5 per group)
according to our previous experimental procedures [1, 50,
51]. Mice were randomly divided into two equal groups
of 5 mice for the purpose of establishing a time course of
tumor cell growth and response to the early therapeutic
intervention with vemurafenib. Vemurafenib treatment
was started 6 days (early intervention trial) after KTC1
tumor cells implantation and performed for about 12 days.
