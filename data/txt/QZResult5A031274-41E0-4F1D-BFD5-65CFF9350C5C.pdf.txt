ABSTRACT
In 2013 the European Medicine Agency (EMA) restricted the indication for antiEGFR targeted therapy to metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a wild-type
RAS gene, increasing the need for reliable RAS mutation testing. We evaluated the
completeness and reproducibility of RAS-testing in the Netherlands.
From 17 laboratories, tumor DNA of the first 10 CRC cases tested in 2014 in
routine clinical practice was re-tested by a reference laboratory using a custom next
generation sequencing panel. In total, 171 CRC cases were re-evaluated for hotspot
mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF.
Most laboratories had introduced complete RAS-testing (65%) and BRAF-testing

(71%) by January 2014. The most employed method for all hotspot regions was Sanger
sequencing (range 35.7 – 49.2%). The reference laboratory detected all mutations that
had been found in the participating laboratories (n = 92), plus 10 additional mutations.
This concerned three RAS and seven BRAF mutations that were missed due to incomplete
testing of the participating laboratory. Overall, the concordance of tests performed by both
the reference and participating laboratory was 100% (163/163; κ-static 1.0) for RAS and
100% (144/144; κ-static 1.0) for BRAF.
Our study shows that RAS and BRAF mutations can be reproducibly assessed using
a variety of testing methods.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Anti-Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
targeted therapy, such as panitumumab and cetuximab,
is effectively reducing the risk of tumor progression and
improving overall survival (OS), progression free survival
(PFS) and quality of life in metastatic colorectal cancer
(mCRC) patients whose tumor is RAS wild-type [1, 2].
Conversely, mCRC patients with mutated RAS tumors
(KRAS and NRAS mutations) who received panitumumab
in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy
had a significantly worse outcome in OS and PFS [3].
This notion has led to a new incentive by the European
Medicine Agency (EMA) for Vectibix (panitumumab) in
June 2013 [4] and for Erbitux (cetuximab) in November
2013 [5], to indicate administration of EGFR targeted
therapy only to patients with wild-type RAS mCRC. This
has increased the need for reliable RAS mutation testing
methods to assure the quality of RAS status determination.
Most molecular testing methods that are used
nowadays accurately assess mutational status of
RAS genes in samples with >30-50% tumor cells, or
alternatively with 15-25% of mutated alleles in the test
sample [6, 7]. However, with lower number of mutated
alleles in the sample, the limit of accurate detection of
a method declines depending on the test method used
[8]. Even when using the same method, differences in
protocols between laboratories can result in different
outcomes. It has been suggested that the reproducibility
amongst different testing methods is not as high as
anticipated for based on previous EQA schemes for KRAS
exon 2 testing[9]. In a recent study, in 29 out of 182 KRAS
exon 2 wild-type tumors (15.9%), as assessed with Sanger
sequencing, a KRAS exon 2 mutation was found with next
generation sequencing (NGS) [10]. This suggests a higher
variability in reproducibility between test methods and
laboratories than initially measured [11].
Given the clinical impact of RAS-testing, it is of
utmost importance to control for reliable performance of
routine RAS-testing methods used in clinical practice. In
this study, we evaluated the inter-laboratory agreement
of RAS-testing amongst 171 mCRC patients of 17 Dutch
laboratories.

Integration of full RAS-testing in the Netherlands
In January 2014, 11 of 17 participating Dutch
laboratories had introduced full RAS testing (65%).
All 17 participating centers performed KRAS exon 2
(codon 12 and 13) and KRAS exon 3 (codon 61) testing.
The method most frequently used for KRAS exon 2 was
Sanger sequencing of PCR products, either directly
(5 laboratories; 51 samples (29.8%)) or to specify
the mutation detected with high resolution melting
(HRM) analysis or to confirm a real-time PCR result (7
laboratories; 70 samples (40.9%)) [Table 1].
Of the 6 laboratories that had not introduced full
RAS-testing, one laboratory did not test for NRAS exon
2, 3, 4 and KRAS exon 4, three had not introduced NRAS
exon 4 (codon 117 and 146), one laboratory did not
have KRAS exon 4 codon 117 in their test panel and one
laboratory did not test for KRAS exon 3 codon 59 [see
Table 1]. One of these 6 laboratories introduced full RAS
testing early 2014 and had only tested 3 out of 10 (30%)
CRC cases with full RAS-testing.
For full RAS-testing direct Sanger sequencing of
PCR products was used most often either with or without
a prescreen (range 35.7% - 49.2%) [Table 1]. The use
of Mass Spectrometry (Sequenom) or CE-IVD kits
(Therascreen) was reported by 2 laboratories (11.6%). In
3 laboratories (17.5%) next generation sequencing (NGS)
with MiSeq (Illumina) or Ion Torrent (Life technologies)
was used for RAS testing. In conclusion, full RAS testing
had been introduced in the majority of laboratories
participating in this study and relied mostly on Sanger
sequencing methods.

Mutation frequencies of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF
The amount and quality of 167 out of 171 received
DNA samples was sufficient for successful evaluation by
the reference laboratory using NGS of at least one of the
target sites (165 samples for KRAS, 163 for NRAS and
163 for BRAF; see materials and methods). Overall, in
102 samples (61.1% (95% CI 53.5 – 68.2)) a mutation
15682

Oncotarget

Figure 1: Mutation prevalence of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF. A) Pie chart showing all evaluated CRC cases (n = 167; 167 of 171

samples could be evaluated for at least one of the target sites). Of these CRC cases, 61.1% had a mutation. KRAS mutations alone were
most frequently observed (43.0%). BRAF mutations were found in 23 CRC cases (All in exon 15; c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu)). The 95% CI
was calculated with Jeffry’s method. B) A total of 71 KRAS mutations was found; 59 in KRAS exon 2 (83.2%), 6 in KRAS exon 3 (8.4%),
and 6 in KRAS exon 4 (8.4%). Gly12Val (29.6%) and Gly12Asp (23.9%) were the most common mutations found followed by Gly13Asp
(12.7%). C) A total of 8 NRAS mutations was detected of which 2 were detected in exon 2 (Gly12Asp) and 6 in exon 3. The most common
mutation in NRAS was Gln61Arg (37.5%).

Association between percentage of neoplastic cells
and mutation detection

in KRAS, NRAS or BRAF was found at the reference
laboratory [Figure 1A].
A KRAS exon 2 mutation was detected in 59 mCRC
cases (35.8%), other RAS mutations were found in KRAS
exon 3 (n = 3 (3.6%)), KRAS exon 4 (n = 3 (3.6%)) NRAS
exon 2 (n = 1 (1.2%)) and NRAS exon 3 (n = 3 (3.6%)). No
mutations in NRAS exon 4 were detected. This resulted in
a total 79 RAS mutations (47.6% (95% CI 40.1-55.2)) of
which only 8 were NRAS mutations. The mean percentage
of mutated alleles was 42.1% (SD 15.7%) for KRAS and
46.1% (SD 23.25%) for NRAS [Supplementary Table
1]. The majority of KRAS mutations affected codon 12
(70.5%), especially p.Gly12Asp (23.9%) and p.Gly12Val
were common (29.6%) [Figure 1B]; 5 out of 8 NRAS
mutations were found in codon 61 (62.5%) [Figure 1C].
None of the samples harbored both or more than one
KRAS and/or NRAS mutation.
BRAF mutations occurred in 23 of 163 CRC cases
(14.1% (95%CI 9.4-20.1)) [Figure 1A] and were all
c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu) mutations in exon 15. The
mean percentage of mutated alleles for BRAF was 34.5%
(SD 14.3%) [Supplementary Table 1]. Both KRAS and
NRAS mutations in our sample were mutually exclusive
with BRAF mutations (OR =2.15 (95%CI 1.80-2.57); Chisquare p<0.01).

Testing sensitivity of RAS-mutations is dependent
on the percentage of neoplastic cells represented in the
test sample; low neoplastic cell percentages may result in
missing of RAS-mutations depending on the technique that
is used[8]. For 158 samples the percentage of neoplastic
cells as estimated by the pathologist of the participating
laboratory was known. The median estimated neoplastic
cell percentage represented in the DNA samples was
50% (inter quartile range (IQR)=30). Of the 158 samples,
47 (29.7%) had neoplastic cell percentages below 40%.
When comparing the distribution of estimated neoplastic
cell percentages amongst RAS-mutated (N = 73) and
RAS-wild-type (N = 85) samples, the median neoplastic
cell percentage was significantly lower in RAS-mutated
samples (50.0% (IQR=28) compared to RAS-wild type
(60.0% (IQR=20)) samples (Mann-Whitney U, p < 0.01)
[Figure 2]. In RAS-mutated samples, the mean percentage
of mutated alleles correlated with the percentage of
neoplastic cells in the test sample (Pearson r = 0.433 (p
< 0.01) for KRAS and Pearson r = 0.792 (p = 0.034) for
NRAS; Supplementary figure 1).
The frequency of RAS mutations amongst samples
with neoplastic cell percentages ≤40% was significantly
higher than in samples >40% neoplastic cells (OR 2.45
(95%CI 1.22 – 4.94), chi-square p = 0.011). A similar
result was obtained when lowering the cut-off to 30 or
20% neoplastic cells, suggesting that the sensitivity of the
RAS mutation analyses were adequate, even in samples
with low neoplastic cells. However, care should be taken
while reporting wild-type in samples with low neoplastic
cells depending on the lower limit of detection of the
technique applied to prevent reporting false-negatives.

High concordance of RAS and BRAF-testing
For 167 samples that could be evaluated by the
reference laboratory, all mutations that had been found in
the participating laboratories were verified. In addition,
the reference lab detected three RAS and seven BRAF
mutations that had not been detected in the participating
laboratories. This concerned mutations in KRAS exon
4 (c.436G>A; p.Ala146Thr), NRAS exon 2 (c.35G>A;
p.Gly12Asp), NRAS exon 3 (c.181C>A; p.Gln61Lys) and
seven mutations in BRAF (c.1799T>A; p.Val600GLu)
that the participating laboratory had not tested for
[Table 2]. Altogether, the inter-laboratory agreement for
tests performed by both the reference and participating
laboratory was 100% (163/163) (κ statistic 1.0) for full
RAS and 100% (144/144) (κ statistic 1.0) for BRAF-testing
[Table 3]. All three additionally found RAS-mutations were
reported back to the respective participating laboratory,
and were confirmed with their newly installed Sanger
sequencing or NGS approaches for the respective target
sites.

DISCUSSION
Our results show an excellent concordance (100%,
kappa 1.0) of RAS-test results of the reference lab oratory
and 17 other Dutch laboratories in routine clinical practice,
despite differences in testing methods used. Overall, full
RAS-testing of KRAS exon 2, 3 and 4 and NRAS exon
2, 3 and 4 has been introduced in the majority of the
participating laboratories (65%). Three RAS mutations
and seven BRAF mutation were missed due to incomplete
testing.

percentage distributions.

The frequency of RAS mutations reported in
our study matches those previously reported in the
literature. Approximately 35-45% of all CRCs contain
RAS-mutations in KRAS exon 2 [3, 12–16], whereas
approximately 10% of RAS-mutations occurs in KRAS
exons 3 and 4 or NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4 [3, 17–19]. In
addition, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations have a
strong tendency towards mutual exclusivity [20]. BRAF
mutations occurred in 14% of our samples, which seems
higher than the reported 9% in the Cancer Genome Atlas
[20]. While BRAF mutation analysis is incorporated
in the test repertoire of most laboratories (71%), some
laboratories only test for BRAF on special request by the
physician when tumors were previously tested RAS wildtype. BRAF mutation frequency amongst KRAS exon 2
wild-type tumors is reported to be around 8-15% [10, 18].
To assure accurate determination of RAS wildtype and mutant status, the quality of mutation detection
for each KRAS and NRAS exon needs to be determined.
Reproducibility is one of the measures that signify the
quality of diagnostic tests. Poor reproducibility can
have several causes: 1) the testing methods used have a
difference in sensitivity (ability to identify tumors with
the mutation) or, 2) there is variation between different
persons/laboratories performing the test (inter-observer
variability). In a recently published Italian study, it was
found that amongst KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors, as
assessed with Sanger sequencing, a KRAS exon 2 mutation
was found with NGS in 28 out of 182 mCRC cases
(15.9%). The difference in sensitivity between the testing
methods could have partly accounted for the discrepancy
found in this study [10]. In our study the discrepancy
between the test results generated in 17 different
laboratories using a variety of testing methods and the
reference laboratory using a NGS approach was naught,
even in samples with a neoplastic cell percentage between
20-40% and in laboratories using Sanger sequencing. In
the 2012 KRAS external quality assessment program of
the European Society of Pathology, less than 5% of all
samples were wrongly genotyped for KRAS amongst 100
laboratories in 26 countries[11].
Testing sensitivity is reflected by the limit of
detection of the method, but is also limited by the
percentage of neoplastic cells represented in the test
sample. In fact, low neoplastic cell percentage (~10%) led
to 16 of the 29 false-negatives in the 2012 KRAS EQA
scheme[11]. For PCR and Sanger sequencing a minimum
amount of 20-30% of tumor cells is required [21]. Our
study has high reproducibility even in samples with a low
neoplastic cell percentage and the percentage of mutated
alleles correlates with the neoplastic cell content in the
sample [Supplementary figure 1]. In fact, the percentage
of RAS mutant samples was significantly higher in samples
with neoplastic cell percentages below 40%, which
demonstrates that mutations could also be detected in
samples with a low neoplastic cell percentage. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

this unexpected observation could be merely coincidental
due to small subgroups and difference in tumor sampling
in combination with variation in estimating the amount
of neoplastic cells, which is known to be high among
pathologists [22, 23].
Potential sources of bias in our study could have
affected the reported reproducibility. First, centers were
asked to send DNA of the first 10 CRC cases tested in
2014. Because KRAS exon 2 mutations are the most
frequent, there were some laboratories where only
KRAS exon 2 mutations or wild-type RAS-status was
reported. This could have led to an overestimation of
the reproducibility because other RAS-mutations were
not present. Secondly, the likelihood of finding falsenegatives is higher when only wild-type samples are
re-tested. In this series only 54 samples were wild-type
for all the tested hotspot mutations and thus could have
led to an underestimation of false-negative wild-type
samples. The small number of NRAS-mutations found has
likely overestimated the reproducibility of this group of
mutations. Future studies need to verify whether newly
installed methods reproducibly detect NRAS mutations,
especially in laboratories that did not report any NRAS
mutations in the tested CRC panel.
In conclusion, our study clearly shows that RASstatus can be reproducibly assessed between laboratories
in routine clinical practice using similar or different
testing methods. With constant improvement of testing
methodologies and quality controls, this offers good
expectations for the future of molecular testing in mCRC.
Nevertheless, more in depth analyses with regard to the
effect of testing sensitivity and the percentage of tumor
cells in the test sample on RAS mutation detection are
warranted.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient selection and data collection
All 22 Dutch institutes that participated in the
European Quality Assurance (EQA) scheme of the
European society of pathology (ESP) in 2013 were
invited to participate in the study. Seventeen laboratories
responded and were subsequently requested to send 10
µl DNA (≥30 ng) of the first 10 mCRCs tested in routine
diagnostics for anti-EGFR targeted therapy from 1st
January 2014. In addition, each laboratory was asked to
indicate the testing method used, the mutations tested for
and the percentage of neoplastic cells in the tissue the
DNA was extracted from. Moreover, the KRAS, NRAS and
BRAF mutations found by the participating laboratories
were reported and stored by a third party until study
end. Retesting of the samples at the reference laboratory
was performed blinded. Approval by a medical ethics
15686

Statistical analysis

committee was not required. All data were reported in deidentified form and are in agreement with the Dutch Data
Protection Act.

All statistical analyses were performed in IBM
SPSS statistics version 20. Mutation frequencies were
calculated for KRAS, NRAS and BRAF. Binominal
confidence intervals were calculated using the Jeffrey’s
interval. The detected mutation(s) in the DNA-samples at
the genotype level were compared between the reference
laboratory and the participating laboratories and expressed
as percentage agreement. Data were evaluated for hotspot
mutations in KRAS exon 2, 3 and 4, NRAS exon 2, 3 and
4 and BRAF exon 15. Concordance (inter-laboratory
agreement, kappa-statistic[24]) was only calculated when
the mutation was targeted in the test panel of both the
reference and participating laboratory. Odds ratios with
95% confidence intervals and chi-square statistics were
calculated to evaluate associations between RAS-mutations
and BRAF. The distribution of tumor cell percentage in the
DNA-samples amongst RAS-mutated and RAS-wild-type
samples was assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test.

Next generation sequencing
A total of 171 DNA samples received from the
participating laboratories (one lab contributed 11 samples)
were quantified on the Qubit platform (Life technologies).
Samples with a DNA concentration below 0.5 ng/µl were
excluded from further analysis. Bar-coded libraries were
prepared from 10-100 ng DNA using a custom AmpliSeq
panel targeting frequently mutated regions in the KRAS,
NRAS, EGFR, PIK3CA, ERBB2, AKT1, BRAF genes and
the AMELX/Y gene as a control gene to determine the sex
of the patient. Libraries were equimolar pooled and clonal
amplification was performed by emulsion PCR using the
One Touch 2 system (Life Technologies) and subsequently
run on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Life
Technologies). Torrent Suite Software v.3.4.2. was used
to pre-process the raw data. Subsequent mapping and
variant calling was performed using SeqNext software
v.4.1.2. (JSI medical systems GmbH). The following
genes and exons were included in the data analysis: KRAS
exon 2, 3 and 4 (NM_004985.3), NRAS exon 2,3 and 4
(NM_002524.3) and BRAF exon 15 (NM_004333.4). The
minimum read coverage allowed to call mutant alleles
was set at 100 reads. In general, read coverage was more
than 500 resulting in a sensitivity of 5% mutant alleles.
For a read coverage between 100-500 reads, a limit of
10% mutant alleles was employed. When coverage was
low or mutation calling could not be established due to
other technical reasons, the run was repeated. When
there was still insufficient coverage of the target sites
after repeating the run, the samples were excluded from
analysis. In total 6 KRAS, 8 NRAS and 8 BRAF target
sites had insufficient coverage due to low amount or poor
DNA quality. Therefore, we could successfully evaluate a
total of 165 KRAS, 163 NRAS and 163 BRAF target sites;
for 167 samples at least one of the target sites could be
successfully evaluated.
