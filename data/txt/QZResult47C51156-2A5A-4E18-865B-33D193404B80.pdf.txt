Abstract
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most frequent leukaemia in adults in Western
countries, is a heterogeneous disease with variable clinical presentation and evolution1,2. Two
major molecular subtypes can be distinguished, characterized respectively by a high or low
number of somatic hypermutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes3,4. The
molecular changes leading to the pathogenesis of the disease are still poorly understood. Here we
performed whole-genome sequencing of four cases of CLL and identified 46 somatic mutations
that potentially affect gene function. Further analysis of these mutations in 363 patients with CLL
identified four genes that are recurrently mutated: notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1),
myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and kelch-like 6 (KLHL6). Mutations
in MYD88 and KLHL6 are predominant in cases of CLL with mutated immunoglobulin genes,
whereas NOTCH1 and XPO1 mutations are mainly detected in patients with unmutated
immunoglobulins. The patterns of somatic mutation, supported by functional and clinical analyses,
strongly indicate that the recurrent NOTCH1, MYD88 and XPO1 mutations are oncogenic
changes that contribute to the clinical evolution of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing with clinical characteristics
and clinical outcomes. It highlights the usefulness of this approach for the identification of
clinically relevant mutations in cancer.

To gain insights into the molecular alterations that cause CLL, we performed whole-genome
sequencing of four cases representative of different forms of the disease: two cases, CLL1
and CLL2, with no mutations in the immunoglobulin genes (IGHV-unmutated) and two
cases, CLL3 and CLL4, with mutations in these genes (IGHV-mutated) (Supplementary
Table 1 and Supplementary Information). We used a combination of whole-genome
sequencing and exome sequencing, as well as long-insert paired-end libraries, to detect
variants in chromosomal structure (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 2–5).
We obtained more than 99.7% concordance between whole-genome sequencing calls and
genotyping data, indicating that the coverage and parameters used were sufficient to detect
most of the sequence variants in these samples (Supplementary Information). We detected
about 1,000 somatic mutations per tumour in non-repetitive regions (Fig. 1a, Supplementary
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6). These numbers of somatic mutations were lower than
the numbers in melanoma and lung carcinoma5,6, but in agreement with previous estimates
of less than one mutation per megabase (Mb) for leukaemias7. The most common
substitution was the transition G>A/C>T, usually occurring in a CpG context (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 2). We also detected marked differences in the mutation pattern between
CLL samples and these differences were associated with tumour subtype (Fig. 1b). Thus,
IGHV-mutated cases showed a higher proportion of A>C/T>G mutations than cases with
unmutated IGHV (16 ± 0.2% versus 6.2 ± 0.1%). The base preceding the adenine in A to C
transversions showed an over-representation of thymine, when compared to the prevalence
expected from its representation in non-repetitive sequences in the wild-type genome (P <
0.001, Fig. 1c), and there were fewer A to C substitutions at GpA dinucleotides than would

be expected by chance (P < 0.001). These differences between CLL subtypes might reflect
the molecular mechanisms implicated in their respective development. The pattern and
context of mutations are consistent with their being introduced by the error-prone
polymerase η during somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin genes8. This indicates that
polymerase η could contribute to the high frequency of A > T to C > G transversions in
cases with IGHV-mutated. It also extends the differences observed between these two CLL
subtypes to the genomic level.
We classified the somatic mutations into three different classes according to their potential
functional effect (Supplementary Information). We also searched for small insertions and
deletions (indels) in coding regions: we found and validated five somatic indels, which
caused frameshifts in protein-coding regions (Supplementary Table 7). We identified 46
mutations that changed the protein-coding sequences of 45 genes in the four patients
analysed (Supplementary Table 7). None of these nucleotide substitutions had been
previously linked to CLL and among the five indel mutations, only one, in NOTCH1
(p.P2515Rfs*4), had been previously found in various lymphoid malignancies, including
CLL9,10. To determine whether any of these 45 genes was mutated in more than one CLL
case, we analysed an initial validation set of 169 CLL patients. We focused on the 26 genes
that are expressed at the RNA level in CLL cells (Supplementary Table 7) because
mutations in expressed genes are more likely to have a biological effect than those in nonexpressed genes. We used a pooled-sequencing strategy that led us to identify four genes
with at least one additional mutation in the validation series: these were NOTCH1, MYD88,
XPO1 and KLHL6 (Table 1 and Supplementary Information).

Analysis of additional CLL cases revealed that the deletion of a CT dinucleotide in
NOTCH1 (p.P2515Rfs*4) was found in 29 of 255 patients and two additional mutations in
the same region were also found (p.Q2503* and p.F2482Ffs*2) (Fig. 2a, b). Accordingly,
NOTCH1 is mutated in 12% of CLL patients (Supplementary Table 8). These mutations
generate a premature stop codon, resulting in a NOTCH1 protein lacking the C-terminal
domain, which contains a PEST sequence (a sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine
and threonine) (Fig. 2a). Removal of this region results in the accumulation of an active
protein isoform in the mutated CLL cells (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3). NOTCH1 is
constitutively expressed in CLL11, but the NOTCH1 mutations identified herein generate a
more stable and active isoform of the protein. Gene expression analysis of ten NOTCH1mutated and 49 unmutated CLL cases revealed a high number of differentially expressed
genes (n = 542, false discovery rate <0.05; Supplementary Table 9). Likewise, in a gene-set
analysis, we found that there was significant differential expression of the NOTCH1
signalling pathway12 and two metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation and
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis). This is consistent with the NOTCH1-mediated activation of
multiple biosynthetic routes in T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia13. When the differential
expression of individual genes from the NOTCH1 pathway was analysed, 23 of the 46 genes
assigned to this pathway12 showed a significant differential expression (P < 0.05) in
NOTCH1-mutated CLL (Fig. 2d). NOTCH1-mutated patients had a more advanced clinical
stage at diagnosis, more adverse biological features and an overall survival that was
significantly shorter than those with NOTCH1 unmutated (10-yr overall survival: 21%
versus 56%, P = 0.03; Fig. 2e, f). NOTCH1-mutated CLL also underwent transformation
into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma more frequently than NOTCH1-unmutated CLL (7 of 31
cases, 23%, versus 3 of 224 cases, 1.3%; P < 0.001). The same IGHV clonal rearrangement
and NOTCH1 mutation were found in the CLL and corresponding transformed diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma of the four cases studied, indicating a clonal relationship of both
components.

A recurrent mutation (p.L265P) in the MYD88 gene (Fig. 3a, b) was also identified in 9 of
310 CLL patients (2.9%). During revision of this manuscript, the same mutation has been
identified in different lymphomas14, highlighting its relevance in the pathogenesis of
lymphoid neoplasias. This protein participates in the signalling pathways of interleukin-1
and Toll-like receptors during the immune response15. MyD88 immunoprecipitation from
CLL cells with the p.L265P mutation resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of large
amounts of IRAK1, in contrast to cells lacking this mutation (Fig. 3c). Other effectors of this
signalling pathway, including STAT3, IκBα and NF-κB p65 subunit, showed higher
phosphorylation in MYD88-mutated than in unmutated CLL cells (Fig. 3d, e) and there was
an increased DNA-binding activity of NF-κBin MYD88-mutated cells (Supplementary Fig.
4). These data support the hypothesis that the MYD88 p.L265P mutation constitutes an
activating mutation of this novel proto-oncogene14,16. Stimulation of interleukin-1 receptor
or Toll-like receptors in MYD88-mutated CLL cells induced the secretion of 5-fold to 150fold higher levels of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN, also known as IL1RA),
interleukin 6 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligands 2, 3 and 4 (CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4), when
compared to the secretion of these cytokines by MYD88-unmutated CLLs. Cytokine
secretion was elevated in MYD88-mutated cells in response to stimulation of at least four of
the eight TLRs tested. No response was observed in lymphocytes carrying the inactivating
MYD88 mutation E52DEL (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 5). The high production of these
cytokines has been implicated in the recruitment of macrophages and T lymphocytes by
CLL cells, creating a favourable niche for their survival17. Moreover, activation of Toll-like
receptors in CLL cells promotes the proliferation of tumour cells and protects them from
spontaneous apoptosis18. Patients with MYD88-mutated CLL were diagnosed at a younger
age than those with wild-type MYD88 (median 43 yr, range 38–63, versus median 63 yr,
range 27–94; P < 0.001) and the disease presented with a more advanced clinical stage (Fig.
3g), although no differences were observed in progression or survival rates. Notably, almost
all patients with the MYD88 p.L265P mutation (seven of the eight evaluated) belonged to
the IGHV-mutated group.

We also identified four cases with mutations in the same codon of the exportin 1 gene
(XPO1; p.E571K and p.E571G). Exportin 1 is implicated in the nuclear export of proteins
and mRNAs in yeast, including members of the MAP kinase pathway19. The fact that the
same residue is mutated in four CLL cases and is part of a highly conserved region
(Supplementary Fig. 6) indicates that the mutation affects XPO1 activity. Notably, all four
cases with mutations in XPO1 belonged to the IGHV-unmutated subtype and two of them
also had the p.P2515Rfs*4 mutation in NOTCH1, indicating that both mutations could have
synergic effects in CLL development.
We identified three patients carrying a total of six mutations (F49L/L65P, L90F and L58P/
T64A/Q81P) in the gene encoding kelch-like protein 6 (KLHL6), which is implicated in the
formation of the germinal centre during B cell maturation20. All six mutations were
clustered between residues 49 and 90 (Supplementary Fig. 7). The presence of several point
mutations in cis, located near the transcriptional start site of a gene that is highly expressed
in the germinal centre, is a characteristic feature of somatic hypermutation. In fact, all three
patients had CLL with mutated IGHV. Although somatic hypermutation occurs mainly in
IGHV regions, other proto-oncogenes, including BCL6, MYC and PIM1, are mutated by
somatic hypermutation in different lymphomas21. However, only BCL6 has been previously
shown to be hypermutated by this mechanism in CLL21. Our data show that KLHL6 is
probably also a target of somatic hypermutation in IGHV-mutated patients, although its
precise contribution to the oncogenic process in CLL remains to be determined.
In addition to these four genes, we identified a series of large genomic alterations that were
previously reported2. They included the deletion, in three cases, of the 13q14 region22, and a

40-Mb deletion in chromosome 6q14–q22 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Table 5). Finally, in one patient we detected a p.P281R mutation in the
cyclin D2 gene (CCND2), which resulted in the accumulation of cyclin D2 in tumour cells
(Supplementary Fig. 8). This finding, together with the high conservation of this residue and
the identification of mutations in the equivalent residue of cyclin D1 (CCND1) in
endometrial cancer23, indicates that this CCND2 mutation could be a driver contributing to
the development of CLL in this patient. The finding illustrates the putative relevance of nonrecurrent mutations for the pathogenesis of CLL.
The International Cancer Genome Consortium project was founded on the concept that
sequencing of cancer genomes could reshape our understanding of cancer biology, with
direct implications for clinical translation24. Our study of four CLL genomes underscores
this transformative potential, although additional studies will be necessary to translate these
findings to the clinic. We have identified four recurrently mutated genes and provided novel
insights into the mechanisms by which leukaemic cells recruit, instruct and coordinate a
tumour microenvironment. Currently, the biological identification of different subgroups of
CLL is based on markers such as IGHV mutational status, cytogenetics, ZAP-70 expression
or CD38 expression, which are not fundamental agents in the leukaemic process. The
classification of patients based on genomic drivers of the disease is conceptually appealing,
as shown by our demonstration that NOTCH1 and MYD88 mutations identify distinct
subgroups of patients with particular clinical and biological features. Furthermore, we
provide functional evidence that both NOTCH1 and MYD88 mutations are activating events
and potential therapeutic targets. The potential to personalize therapeutic choices for patients
on the basis of the genomic architecture of their cancers is the long-term aspiration for
studies such as this, combining whole-genome sequencing, functional studies and clinical
analysis of patients with cancer.

METHODS SUMMARY

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Four patients with CLL, who had given informed consent for sample collection and analysis,
were studied. Tumour samples were obtained before treatment and tumour cells were
separated from non-tumour cells by immunomagnetic depletion of T cells, natural killer
cells, monocytes and granulocytes (Supplementary Information). Tumour cell purity was
≥98% as assessed by flow cytometry. Normal blood cells from the same patient were
obtained after treatment, resulting in no detectable, or less than 0.05%, tumour cell
contamination, as assessed by flow cytometry. Additional samples from 363 patients were
obtained for clinical validation. Protocols for long-insert and short-insert library construction
and for massively parallel paired-end sequencing have been described elsewhere (ref. 25 and
Supplementary Information). Genotyping and copy number analysis were performed using
the Affymetrix SNP6.0, Agilent 1M and Illumina OmniQuad arrays on the same cases used
for whole-genome sequencing. For the validation of candidate genes in a set of 169
additional CLL patients, we used a combination of PCR amplification and Illumina
sequencing in pooled samples, resulting in efficient identification of germline and somatic
mutations (Supplementary Information). Sequencing data were aligned to the human
reference genome (GRCh37) using Burrows–Wheeler alignment (BWA)26 and somatic
substitutions were identified using Sidrón, a probabilistic binomial model that uses
genotyping data to calibrate sequencing error per sample. Functional analyses of the
identified mutations were performed using cryopreserved primary tumour cells. For gene
expression analysis, RNA was purified from tumour cells and analysed using the HU133
plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix). For immunoprecipitation and western blotting, CLL cell
extracts were prepared and detected using the indicated antibodies (Supplementary
Information). For Toll-like receptor stimulation of CLL cells, the Human TLR1–9 agonist
kit (InvivoGen) was used.

Figure 1. Profile of somatic mutations in four CLL genomes

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

a, Distribution of somatic alterations. For each tumour genome, copy number (solid lines),
density of mutations per 5-Mb window (bars) and protein-coding mutations (dots) are
shown. The shaded rectangle indicates the location of the 13q14 deletion that was present in
three of the four CLL cases. Chromosome numbers are listed below the four profiles. b,
Frequency of substitutions in each CLL tumour for the six possible classes of mutation. c,
Distribution of the four possible NpA dinucleotides for the A to C transversion in each
tumour genome, compared with the expected distribution across the genome. The total
number of A to C substitutions per case is indicated at the top (**, P < 0.001).

Figure 2. Mutational and functional analysis of NOTCH1 in CLL

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

a, Schematic representation of human NOTCH1, showing the main domains and locations
of the three different somatic mutations identified in CLL. NEC, NOTCH1 extracellular
subunit; NTM, NOTCH1 transmembrane subunit; ICN, intracellular domain of NOTCH1;
LNR, Lin-12 NOTCH repeats; RAM, RAM domain; ANK, ankyrin repeat domain; PEST,
PEST domain. b, Electropherogram showing the heterozygous CT deletion recurrently
identified in CLL. c, Western blot showing NOTCH1 protein levels in CLL cases with or
without the NOTCH1 p.P2515Rfs*4 mutation, and in Jurkat cells as a control. The arrow
indicates the band corresponding to the NTM; the large arrowhead indicates the smaller
band corresponding to the mutant form. d, Heat map showing the 23 genes of the NOTCH1
pathway that are differentially expressed in NOTCH1-mutated versus non-mutated CLL. e,
Distribution of disease stage (Binet), ZAP-70 expression status, CD38 expression status and
IGHV mutational status (UM, unmutated IGHV) in patients with or without mutations in
NOTCH1 (*, P < 0.02; **, P < 0.01). f, Actuarial probability of overall survival of CLL
patients with mutated or unmutated NOTCH1 (*, P = 0.03).

Figure 3. Mutational and functional analysis of MYD88 in CLL

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

a, Multiple sequence alignment of MyD88 around the mutated residue (arrow) in different
species. Cons., degree of conservation. b, Electropherogram showing the recurrent
heterozygous p.L265P MYD88 mutation (arrow) detected in CLL. c, Cell extracts from a
MYD88-mutated CLL (L265P) and a MYD88-unmutated CLL (WT) were
immunoprecipitated with anti-MyD88 antibody. The immunoprecipitated and unbound
fractions were analysed by western blot using anti-IRAK1 and anti-MyD88 antibodies. d,
Western blot analysis of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3 (Tyr 705)) and total STAT3 in
cell extracts from MYD88-mutated or unmutated CLL tumour cells. β-Actin was used as a
control to show equal loading. e, Western blots showing phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα),
total IκBα, phosphorylated p65 subunit of NF-κB (p-p65) and total p65 subunit of NF-κB
in cell extracts from MYD88-mutated or unmutated CLL tumour cells. f, Heat map
representing the cytokine levels secreted by B cells from eight individuals after Toll-like
receptor stimulation. Only the five cytokines that showed the most significant differences
between MYD88-mutated and MYD88-unmutated CLL are shown. ‘E52DEL’ indicates B
cells from two patients with an inactivating MYD88 mutation, ‘WT’ corresponds to tumour
cells from CLL patients without MYD88 mutation and ‘L265P’ indicates tumour cells from
patients carrying a mutated MYD88. The stimulation experiments for each of the Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) are represented in different colours. NS, no stimulus. g, Distribution of
disease stage (Binet), ZAP-70 expression status, CD38 expression status and IGHV
mutational status (UM, unmutated IGHV) in patients according to the presence or absence
of p.L265P MYD88 mutation (*, P < 0.03).
