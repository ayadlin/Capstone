Abstract
Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) occurs in ∼10% of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. However, it is uncertain whether overexpression of FGFR1 is causally linked to the
poor prognosis of amplified cancers. Here, we show that FGFR1 overexpression is robustly associated with
FGFR1 amplification in two independent series of breast cancers. Breast cancer cell lines with FGFR1 overexpression and amplification show enhanced ligand-dependent signaling, with increased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase–AKT signaling pathways in response to FGF2,
but also show basal ligand-independent signaling, and are dependent on FGFR signaling for anchorageindependent growth. FGFR1-amplified cell lines show resistance to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which is reversed by
small interfering RNA silencing of FGFR1, suggesting that FGFR1 overexpression also promotes endocrine therapy resistance. FGFR1 signaling suppresses progesterone receptor (PR) expression in vitro, and likewise, amplified cancers are frequently PR negative, identifying a potential biomarker for FGFR1 activity. Furthermore, we
show that amplified cancers have a high proliferative rate assessed by Ki67 staining and that FGFR1 amplification
is found in 16% to 27% of luminal B–type breast cancers. Our data suggest that amplification and overexpression
of FGFR1 may be a major contributor to poor prognosis in luminal-type breast cancers, driving anchorageindependent proliferation and endocrine therapy resistance. Cancer Res; 70(5); 2085–94. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Despite substantial improvements in the treatment of
breast cancer, resistance to therapy is a major clinical problem. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance and the
identification of novel therapeutic targets is of vital importance if the prognosis of breast cancer is to be further improved. Molecular subtyping of breast cancer has identified
distinct subtypes of breast cancer. Cancers that express the
estrogen receptor (ER) are divided into two broad categories
of luminal A and B types (1), largely depending on whether
the tumor has low or high proliferation (2, 3). Although, in
general, ER-positive tumors are considered to have a good
prognosis, highly proliferative, luminal B–type tumors have

a poor prognosis in patients treated with adjuvant endocrine
therapy (4). Resistance to endocrine therapy, whether acquired or intrinsic, is a major factor implicated in the relapse
of these breast cancers, and understanding the factors that result in endocrine therapy resistance is important if outcome is
to be improved.
Several recurrent high-level amplifications have been identified in breast cancer (5), and for some of these amplifications, the driver gene has been identified [e.g., HER2
at chromosomal region 17q21 and cyclin D1 (CCND1)
at 11q13]. Along with these genes, fibroblast growth factor
receptor 1 (FGFR1) was one of the first to be shown to be
amplified in breast cancer (6), amplified in ∼10% cancers
(5). Amplification of FGFR1 is associated with early relapse
and poor survival, specifically in ER-positive breast cancer
(7). Amplification of FGFR1 is uncommon in HER2-amplified
tumors, suggesting that amplification of FGFR1 and HER2
may be mutually exclusive ways of activating similar downstream pathways (7).
However, amplifications at chromosomal region 8p11-12,
the genomic locus of FGFR1, are complex with at least two
separate regions or cores of amplification (8). Some studies
have found that FGFR1 expression correlates with FGFR1
amplification (8–12), but others have not (13–16). Although
we have previously shown that the FGFR1-amplified cell line
MDA-MB-134 is dependent on FGFR1 for proliferation (17), it
is not universally accepted that FGFR1 is a driver of cancers
harboring 8p11-12 amplification.

Here, we have comprehensively evaluated FGFR1-amplified
breast cancer, showing that FGFR1 expression is highly correlated with FGFR1 copy number. We show that MDA-MB-134
cells have acquired a KRAS mutation that compromises them
as a model cell line, and identified several breast cancer cell
lines with FGFR1 overexpression and amplification. We show
that overexpression of FGFR1 results in both enhanced liganddependent and ligand-independent signaling, with important
consequences for anchorage-independent growth and response to endocrine therapy. Finally, we provide evidence
that FGFR1 amplification is a frequent event in proliferative,
luminal B subtype, ER-positive cancers, suggesting that FGFR1
overexpression may be a major factor contributing to the
poor prognosis of these tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, materials, and antibodies. Cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
or Asterand and maintained in phenol red–free DMEM or
RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; FBS Gold,
PAA) and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich). S68 was a
kind gift of Veronique Catros-Quemener (University of Rennes,
Rennes, France). MDA-MB-134 was originally obtained directly from M.D. Anderson by Mike O' Hare (Ludwig Institute,
London, United Kingdom). PD173074, 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4-OHT), and ICI-182780 were from Sigma, and U0126 was
from Calbiochem (Merck KGaA). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was from Dharmacon: FGFR1 siGenome SMARTpool
(siFGFR1), siGenome Non-Targeting siRNA Pool#1 (siCON),
and PLK1 siGenome SMARTpool (siPLK1). Antibodies used
were phosphorylated fibroblast receptor substrate 2 (FRS2;
Tyr196), phosphorylated AKT1 (Ser473), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204),
phosphorylated RSK (Thr359/Ser363), phosphorylated phospholipase C (PLC) γ1 (Tyr783), ERK1/2, CCND1, and progesterone receptor (PR; all from Cell Signaling Technology) and
FGFR1, ER, and β-actin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Tumor samples and microarray-based comparative
genomic hybridization. The Guy's series of 87 ER-positive
primary breast cancers all treated with adjuvant tamoxifen
has been described previously (3). Analysis of FGFR1 chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and Ki67 was on 3-μm-thick
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. The
tissue microarray (TMA) series of 245 invasive breast cancers
has been described previously (18). RNA was extracted from
tumor sections with RNeasy FFPE RNA Isolation kit (Qiagen).
RNA was extracted from cell lines using Trizol (Invitrogen).
DNA was extracted using DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Invitrogen). The 32K bacterial artificial chromosome rearray collection (CHORI) tiling path array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) platform was constructed at the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, and arrays were
hybridized and analyzed as previously described (19, 20).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using SuperScript III and random hexamers
(Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using Taqman
chemistry (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI Prism 7900T System

(Applied Biosystems) using standard curve method. Expression of FGFR1 (Hs00241111_m1), PR (Hs01556701_m1), or
CCND1 (Hs00277039_m1) was expressed relative to the mean
of three endogenous controls: S18 (4310893E), MRPL19
(Hs00608519_m1), and β-actin (4310881E).
Definition of FGFR1 overexpression. Gene expression
analysis using Affymetrix U133A Genechips (Affymetrix)
was performed and normalized as previously described (3).
The median-weighted mean of five FGFR1 probes (207822_at,
210973_s_at, 211535_s_at, 222164_at, and 226705_at) was used
to assess FGFR1 expression.
To define FGFR1 overexpression, for both quantitative PCR
or Affymetrix data, the SD of the data was estimated from the
median absolute deviation. A sample was considered FGFR1
overexpressed when level exceeded 3 SDs from the median,
identifying samples with outlier overexpression.
CISH and immunohistochemistry. FGFR1 CISH was performed on the TMA series with an in-house biotin-labeled
probe (21) and on the Guy's series (3) with FGFR1 ZytoDotSPEC Probe (Zytovision GMbH) and the SPoT-Light CISH
Polymer Detection kit (Invitrogen). FGFR1 signals per cell
were counted in 100 tumor nuclei, considered amplified if
>50% of the neoplastic cells harbored either more than five
copies of the gene or large gene clusters (22). All amplified tumors were also amplified according to criteria outlined in the
American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American
Pathologists guidelines for HER2 gene amplification. The Ki67
staining was performed using the MIB-1 clone (Dako). Antigen
retrieval was with 2-min pressure cooking in 0.01 mol/L citrate
(pH 6). Bound antibody was detected using the Vector ABC kit
(Vector Laboratories), with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen (Dako). Both FGFR1 CISH and Ki67 immunohistochemistry
were assessed blinded to FGFR1 expression.
Cell line drug sensitivity and siRNA transfection. All experiments were performed in 10% serum unless stated otherwise. Cell lines were transfected with siRNA (50 nmol/L final
concentration) in 96-well plates with RNAiMax (Invitrogen).
Survival was assessed with CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay
(Promega). For sensitivity to PD173074, cell lines were plated
in 96-well plates; the following day, media were supplemented
with PD173074 at various concentrations; and survival was
assessed after 96 h of exposure. For assessment of endocrine
therapy sensitivity, cells were maintained in phenol red–free
medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-coated
charcoal-stripped serum (HyClone), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
and 1 nmol/L estradiol (Sigma); plated in 96-well plates; and
treated for 6 d with a range of doses of 4-OHT.
FGFR1 stable cell lines. cDNA coding for full-length
FGFR1-IIIc was cloned into the p-LEX-MCS vector (Open
Biosystems). The vector was packaged into lentivirus in
293-T cells, and T47D cells were infected with p-LEX-MCS
(T47D-EV) or p-LEX-FGFR1 (T47D-FGFR1). At 96 h after infection, 1 μg/mL puromycin was added, and a polyclonal
stable pool was established under continuous selection.
Anchorage-independent growth. CAL120 cells were seeded
in 4% agarose (Sigma) in six-well plates (5,000 per well), on a
base layer of 5% agarose, in 1× RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, and glutamine with or without 1 μmol/L PD173074. The top layer

was left to set, following which a covering of medium with or
without 1 μmol/L PD173074 was added and replaced every
3 to 4 d. After 2 wk, colonies of cells were visualized by light
microscopy followed by staining with crystal violet and
counting of colony number.
Western blotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Indicated cell lines were grown on 10-cm plates, treated as
indicated, and lysed in NP40 lysis buffer. Western blots were
carried out with precast TA or Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) as
previously described (23). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis was performed as described previously (23).
ER-directed transcription. SUM44 cells were transfected
with EREIItkLuc and pCH110 using GeneJuice (EMD Biosciences, Inc.), and estrogen response element (ERE)–luciferase
and β-galactosidase were assayed after 48 h of FGF2 treatment,
or not, as previously described (24).

Statistical analysis. All statistical analysis was two-sided
and performed with GraphPad Prism version 5.0.

Results
FGFR1 is robustly overexpressed in FGFR1-amplified
tumors. We examined the relationship between FGFR1 amplification and FGFR1 mRNA expression in two independent
series of breast cancers. The first series consisted of 87 ERpositive tumors (Guy's series; ref. 3), with FGFR1 copy number assessed in 58 cases by CISH. FGFR1 mRNA expression,
assessed by gene expression profiling, was substantially higher
in amplified tumors compared with nonamplified tumors
(5.91 versus 1.0; P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test; Fig. 1A).
The second series consisted of invasive breast cancers in a
TMA (18). FGFR1 amplification was present in 11.8% tumors

expression than nonamplified controls (13.4 versus 1; P = 0.0002, Mann-Whitney U test). C, FGFR1 expression assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in a panel

(11 of 93 analyzable cores). RNA was extracted from corresponding FFPE tissue sections, and FGFR1 expression was
assessed by quantitative PCR in 10 FGFR1-amplified tumor
sections and 17 grade- and ER-matched controls. FGFR1 was
substantially higher in amplified tumors compared with nonamplified controls (median, 13.4 versus 1.0; P < 0.0001, MannWhitney U test; Fig. 1B). In both series, overexpression of
FGFR1 mRNA was only found in cancers with FGFR1 amplification. In the first (88%, 7 of 8) and second (80%, 8 of 10) series,
amplified tumors displayed FGFR1 expression higher than any
nonamplified control, validating a tight relationship between
amplification and overexpression.
Identification of FGFR1-amplified cell line models. We
had previously shown that the MDA-MB-134 cell line, obtained
directly from originating lab in M.D. Anderson, harbors FGFR1
amplification and overexpression and was sensitive to FGFR1
inhibitors and silencing of FGFR1 by RNA interference (17).
Multiple different siRNAs targeting FGFR1 reduced the sur-

vival of MDA-MB-134, showing that the effect was on target
(Supplementary Fig. S1). However, over time, we were unable
to propagate the original cell line, and we obtained a
new sample from the ATCC. To our surprise, the resupplied
MDA-MB-134 was no longer sensitive to FGFR1 siRNA
(Fig. 2A) despite efficient knockdown of FGFR1 (Supplementary Fig. S1). We confirmed by both aCGH and gene expression
profiling that the resupplied line was indeed MDA-MB-134
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The resupplied line overexpressed
FGFR1 (Fig. 1D) but was also found to be heterozygous for a
G12R KRAS mutation (Supplementary Fig. S1). This mutation
has always been present in MDA-MB-134 but originally only at
low frequency (25). Blockade of MAP/ERK kinase signaling
with U0126 in the KRAS mutant MDA-MB-134 restored dependence on FGFR signaling (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that
the KRAS mutation explained the resistance to FGFR targeting.
With MDA-MB-134 partially compromised as a model of
FGFR1 amplification, we set out to identify new cell line

FGFR1 Amplification in Breast Cancer

Figure 3. FGFR1 amplification drives both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent signaling. A, indicated cell lines growing in 10% serum were
treated for 15 min before lysis with 1 ng/mL FGF2 (+) or not (−). Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies against
phosphorylated FRS2 (Tyr196), phosphorylated AKT1 (Ser473), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and β-actin. Two different exposures of
FRS2 (Tyr196) are shown. B, stable polyclonal pool of T47D cells was established with empty vector (T47D-EV) or FGFR1 expression vector
(T47D-FGFR1). Western blots of T47D-EV or T47D-FGFR1 cells treated for 15 min before lysis with 1 ng/mL FGF2, or no treatment (−), and blotted
with indicated antibodies. C, indicated cell lines were serum starved for 24 h, and lysates were made after 1-h exposure to 1 μmol/L PD173074 (+),

models. We screened a panel of 40 breast cancer cell lines by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for FGFR1
and identified six breast cancer cell lines that overexpressed
FGFR1 (CAL120, JIMT-1, MDA-MB-134 KRAS, MFM223, S68,
and SUM44; Fig. 1C). All cell lines that overexpressed FGFR1
harbored high-level FGFR1 amplification as assessed by aCGH
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Two cell lines were not investigated
further—JIMT-1 (due to coamplification of HER2) and
MFM223 (due to coamplification of FGFR2) (26)—either of
which might complicate assessment. All amplified cell lines
overexpressed FGFR1 protein by Western blot (Fig. 1D).
FGFR1 amplification is required for anchorage-independent
growth. We examined the effect of targeting FGFR1 in the
newly identified cell line models of FGFR1 amplification. In
routine two-dimensional culture, silencing of FGFR1 by siRNA
did not affect survival of SUM44, CAL120, or S68 (Fig. 2B)
despite achieving substantial knockdown of FGFR1 (Fig. 2B).
The cell lines were also not sensitive to the potent pan-FGFR
inhibitor PD173074 in two-dimensional culture, unlike the
FGFR2-amplified positive control cell line SUM52PE (Fig. 2C;
ref. 27). Therefore, we investigated the requirement of FGFR signaling in three-dimensional culture by growing cells in soft agar.
This showed that FGFR activity was required for anchorageindependent growth of CAL120, and colony formation was
completely abolished by PD173074 (Fig. 2D). We were unable
to assess S68 and SUM44 in this assay, as they did not grow in
soft agar (data not shown).
FGFR1 amplification drives both ligand-dependent and
ligand-independent signaling. FGFs are present in very low
concentrations in normal serum; FGFs bind heparin proteoglycans (HSPG) avidly and are sequestered in the extracellular matrix and cell surface at the site of production (28).

We examined downstream signaling in response to the
addition of relatively low-dose FGF2 (1 ng/mL) to routine
culture medium (Fig. 3A). Signaling through the FGFR family
is reliant on the adapter protein FRS2 to activate mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling. Phosphorylation of FRS2 in
response to FGF2 was only seen in amplified cell lines (Fig.
3A). Amplified cell lines displayed substantially enhanced
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in comparison with control cell lines,
with a minor increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MCF7
and no change in SKBR3. Ribosomal S6 kinase (p90-RSK),
a downstream effector of MAPK signaling (29–31), was
also phosphorylated in response to FGF2 only in amplified cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S4). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2
and AKT was almost exclusively FGF2 dependent in SUM44
(Fig. 3A).
To confirm that overexpression of FGFR1 can enhance
downstream signaling in response to ligand, we generated
T47D cells that stably overexpressed FGFR1. T47D cells
were infected with a lentiviral FGFR1 expression vector,
or control empty vector, and a stable polyclonal pool was
established. T47D-FGFR1 cells showed both increased
FGF2-dependent signaling, with an induction of AKT phosphorylation not seen in control cells, and an increase in
basal-unstimulated signaling (Fig. 3B), suggesting that
overexpression of FGFR1, to high levels, could induce
ligand-independent signaling.
We examined whether FGFR1 cancer cell lines showed
basal signaling in serum-starved conditions. After serum
starvation, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was blocked by
PD173074 in both CAL120 and SUM44PE (Fig. 3C). To
differentiate ligand-independent from autocrine-mediated

signaling, we examined FGF ligand expression in cell lines.
CAL120 expressed both FGF2 mRNA and conditioned medium with FGF2 ligand (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast,
T47D, SUM44, MDA-MB-134, and other FGFR1-amplified
cell lines did not appreciably express any of the FGFR1 ligands (data not shown), indicating that in these cell lines
FGFR1 overexpression resulted in low-level basal ligandindependent signaling.
FGFR1 amplification drives endocrine therapy
resistance. We have previously shown that amplification of
FGFR1 is associated with poor prognosis specifically in patients with ER-positive breast cancer (7). One potential explanation for this observation could be resistance to endocrine
therapies. To investigate this, we examined the effect of silencing of FGFR1 on endocrine therapy sensitivity in the
FGFR1-amplified ER-positive cell lines. We initially studied
the FGFR-sensitive MDA-MB-134 subline, which was partially
resistant to 4-OHT (Fig. 4A). Silencing of FGFR1 in this cell
line with FGFR1 siRNA SMARTpool, or two individual siRNAs,
increased 4-OHT sensitivity compared with cells transfected
with siCON nontargeting control (Fig. 4A). At both 10−7 mol/L
and 10−6 mol/L 4-OHT, siCON-transfected cells were less sensitive than siFGFR1-transfected and both individual siRNAtransfected cells (P < 0.05, Student's t test).
SUM44 is an ER-positive cell line that is sensitive to 4-OHT,
although addition of FGF2 to medium abolished sensitivity to
4-OHT (Fig. 4B). Silencing of FGFR1 in SUM44 only modestly

increased sensitivity to 4-OHT but blocked the ability of FGF2
to cause resistance (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the effect of FGF2
was mediated by FGFR1. This observation concurs with the
strong ligand dependence of downstream signaling in
SUM44 (Fig. 3A). FGF2 also induced resistance to the ER antagonist ICI-182780 (data not shown). Similarly, T47D-FGFR1
cells showed greater resistance to 4-OHT and estrogen deprivation in response to FGF2, in comparison with T47D-EV cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
We examined the mechanism of resistance. In SUM44, 4OHT reduced S-phase fraction, but dual treatment with
FGF2 and 4-OHT increased S-phase fraction to levels comparable with untreated cells (Fig. 4C and D). In contrast, in
FGFR1 siRNA-transfected cells, 4-OHT reduced S-phase fraction, but FGF2 was unable to restore levels comparable with
untreated cells [relative increase FGF2 + tamoxifen versus
tamoxifen: siCON (120%) versus siFGFR1 (43%); P = 0.047,
Student's t test]. We examined signaling in SUM44 cells
treated with 4-OHT and ICI-182780 with or without FGF2
(Fig. 5). Treatment with FGF2 alone decreased PR expression
to a comparable level with 4-OHT. In contrast, CCND1 was
substantially elevated in the presence of FGF2 (Fig. 5A) and
remained elevated after treatment with 4-OHT. Treatment
with ICI-182780 led to ER degradation and partial loss of
CCND1 expression in FGF2-treated cells, although CCND1
remained elevated compared with ICI-182780–treated cells
without FGF2 (Fig. 5A and B).

Quantitative PCR assessment of PGR mRNA (PR)
confirmed that PR expression was suppressed by FGF2
(Fig. 5C). We therefore examined the effect of FGF2
on an ERE-luciferase reporter construct. FGF2 inhibited
ER-directed transcription (Fig. 5D), confirming that the
decrease in PR expression reflected a suppression of
ER-dependent transcriptional activity. Both ERK1/2 and
RSK phosphorylation was persistently phosphorylated by
FGF2 stimulation after 24 hours, whereas AKT and PLC phosphorylation was undetectable (Fig. 5B). These data suggest
that FGFR1 signaling induced endocrine resistance through
persistent MAPK activation, which promoted CCND1 expression both in an ER-dependent and ER-independent manner, to
cause resistance to endocrine therapy.
Clinical features of FGFR1-amplified tumors. In the
Guy's series of 87 ER-positive tumors all treated with tamoxifen
as sole adjuvant therapy (3), distant metastasis-free survival was
significantly worse for FGFR1-overexpressing tumors compared
with tumors lacking overexpression (Fig. 6A). In this series,
FGFR1-overexpressing tumors were frequently ER positive
but PR negative (PR negative, 20% nonamplified versus 60%

www.aacrjournals.org

amplified; P = 0.032, Fisher's exact test; Fig. 6B). This concurs
with the in vitro observations with SUM44 (Fig. 5).
We examined whether FGFR1 amplification/overexpression
was associated with any one specific breast cancer subtype (1).
We next interrogated a published gene expression array data
set of 295 breast cancers from van de Vijver and colleagues
(32). Overexpression of FGFR1 was strongly associated with
luminal B–type breast cancers (Fig. 6), as was the incidence of
8p11-12 amplification (the genomic locus of FGFR1; Fig. 6).
Similarly, in the data set of Chin and colleagues (12), FGFR1
overexpression and high-level amplification of FGFR1 were
found specifically in ER-positive tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S6). To confirm these findings, we assessed Ki67 expression, as a surrogate of proliferative rate, in the Guy's series of
ER-positive breast cancers. FGFR1-overexpressing cancers
had a significantly higher proliferative rate (Fig. 6), with
87.5% (eight of nine) tumors having high Ki67 [≥14% as defined by Cheang and colleagues (2)]. These data suggest that
FGFR1 amplification is particularly important in the highly
proliferative, poor-prognosis, luminal B subtype, ER-positive
breast cancers.

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that amplification of FGFR1
promotes anchorage-independent proliferation and resistance
to endocrine therapies, and this may be reflected in the poor
prognosis of amplified cancers. Overexpression of FGFR1 in
amplified cell lines results in aberrant ligand-dependent signaling, with persistent activation of MAPK signaling and engagement of PI3K-AKT signaling in response to ligand,
which is not seen in unamplified cell lines. In addition, we
show that higher levels of FGFR1 expression result in basal ligand-independent signaling, further enhancing downstream
signaling. The amplified cell lines MDA-MB-134 and CAL120
are sensitive to targeting of FGFR1, showing that FGFR1 is a
potential therapeutic target in amplified cancers.
Our study adds to the increasing evidence linking aberrant
FGF signaling to breast cancer (33). A single nucleotide polymorphism in FGFR2 is associated with an increased risk of

ER-positive breast cancer (34, 35). Mouse models have shown
that expression and constitutive activation of FGFR1 in the
mouse mammary epithelium induced proliferation and invasive lesions (36). Activation of the same construct in vitro in
murine HC11 cells drove proliferation, survival, and invasion
(37), confirming the potential oncogenic nature of FGFR1 signaling. Interestingly, expression of activated FGFR1 in murine
prostate induced carcinoma, but a similar FGFR2 construct
did not (38), suggesting that FGFR1 may have enhanced
oncogenic potential in comparison with FGFR2.
Our data suggest that FGF ligand, potentially in an epithelialstromal interaction, is important in the promotion of breast
cancer progression by FGFR1. FGF2 is expressed at substantially higher levels in breast cancers (39), and in serum and
nipple aspirate fluid (40) of patients with breast cancer, compared with women without cancer (40, 41). In addition, breast
cancer cells express HSPGs on their cell surface that bind and
promote the FGFR1-FGF2 interaction (42). A consequence of

series of ER-positive tumors with FGFR1 overexpression (n = 10) versus normal FGFR1 expression (76). FGFR1-overexpressing tumors have

tumors have higher Ki67 (P = 0.021, Mann-Whitney U test). Of tumors with high proliferation [≥14% Ki67 as a surrogate for luminal B subtype (2)], 16%
have FGFR1 overexpression compared with 3.5% of low-proliferating cancers. D, left, incidence of FGFR1 overexpression in breast cancers according

FGFR1 Amplification in Breast Cancer

the low FGF ligand concentration of serum is that FGFR1amplified cancer cell lines have effectively been derived in
conditions of very low ligand (43). It is plausible that the lack
of dependence on FGFR1 most amplified cell lines display in
two-dimensional culture could simply reflect the conditions
under which these cell lines were derived.
It is important to emphasize that genes other than FGFR1 in
the 8p11-12 amplicon are also likely to contribute to oncogenesis (44–46), potentially acting in collaboration with FGFR1
(46). In addition, FGFR1 is commonly coamplified with CCND1
(5), which may cooperate in oncogenesis (46, 47). We have
shown a tight relationship between FGFR1 mRNA expression
and FGFR1 amplification. In particular, tumors lacking FGFR1
amplification did not overexpress FGFR1 to a level comparable
with amplified tumors, in contrast to previous data (9). A small
fraction of FGFR1-amplified cancers do not seem to overexpress FGFR1 mRNA. Although this may constitute a falsepositive CISH result, or a false-negative quantitative PCR
result, we consider it more likely that these cancers are driven
by other genes within the 8p11-12 amplicon (8).
Our data suggest that FGFR1 amplification drives resistance to endocrine therapy in vitro and that this observation
is reflected in the poor prognosis of FGFR1-overexpressing
tumors treated with adjuvant tamoxifen (Fig. 5). We have
also previously studied FGFR1 amplification in a large series
of 800 breast cancers (7). In this data set, the ER-positive tumors treated with tamoxifen as sole adjuvant therapy had an
equally poor prognosis [FGFR1-amplified overall survival
hazard ratio 5.58 versus nonamplified; 95% confidence
interval (95% CI), 1.47–21.1]. Although the decision to
give tamoxifen was unrandomized in both the data sets
(Fig. 6A), the data do not support there being substantial
benefit with adjuvant tamoxifen. The observation that ERpositive FGFR1-amplified tumors are more likely to be PR

negative than controls (Fig. 6) provides further support for
the role of FGFR1 in the growth of these tumors; loss of PR
expression is thought to reflect activation of growth factor
signaling (48) and may provide a biomarker of FGFR1 activity
in amplified cancers.
Taken together, we provide strong circumstantial evidence
that FGFR1 amplification is one of the major drivers of highly
proliferative, poor-prognosis, luminal B subtype, ER-positive
breast cancers. This provides a strong rationale for the investigation of drugs that target FGFR1 in breast cancer, particularly in combination with endocrine therapy. Several studies
of FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have commenced, or are
planned, in breast cancer and the results of these studies
are awaited with interest.
