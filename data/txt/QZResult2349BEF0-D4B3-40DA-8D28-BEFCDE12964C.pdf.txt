Abstract
The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 is highly expressed in
CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and was recently
identified as a key player in mediating their inhibitory
functions. Here, we describe for the first time the expression
and function of Foxp3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
cells and tumors. Foxp3 expression was induced by transforming growth factor-B2 (TGF-B2), but not TGF-B1 stimulation in these cells, and was partially suppressed following
antibody-mediated neutralization of TGF-B2. The TGF-B2
effect could be mimicked by ectopic expression of a
constitutively active TGF-B type I receptor/ALK5 mutant.
Down-regulation of Foxp3 with small interfering RNA (siRNA)
in pancreatic carcinoma cells resulted in the up-regulation of
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 expression, providing evidence
for a negative transcriptional activity of Foxp3 also in these
epithelial cells. Coculture of Foxp3-expressing tumor cells
with naive T cells completely inhibited T-cell proliferation,
but not activation, and this antiproliferative effect was
partially abrogated following specific inhibition of Foxp3
expression. These findings indicate that pancreatic carcinoma
cells share growth-suppressive effects with Treg and suggest
that mimicking Treg function may represent a new mechanism of immune evasion in pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res
2007;67(17):8344–50]

Introduction
The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 has been identified as a
key player in regulatory T cell (Treg) function and is, thus far, the
only definitive marker of CD4+CD25+ Treg (1, 2). The importance
of Tregs resides in their pivotal role in maintaining immunologic
tolerance. Naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Tregs as well as Foxp3transduced CD4+ T cells inhibit naive T-cell proliferation in vitro
(2). Apart from naturally occurring Tregs that arise in the thymus,
adaptive Tregs have been identified, which predominate in
infections and cancer. Recent studies reported that the prevalence
of Tregs is increased in the blood and the tumor microenvironment
of patients with a variety of different tumors including pancreatic
adenocarcinoma (3–6). In addition, the accumulation of Tregs in

local lymph nodes in patients with ovarian carcinoma is associated
with a less favorable prognosis (4). Furthermore, increased
numbers of Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells in the blood are considered a
marker for metastasis in pancreatic cancer patients (7). Depletion
of Tregs has been shown to enhance the efficiency of cell-based
tumor vaccination (8). The molecular mechanisms through which
Tregs exert their immunosuppressive function are a major focus
of current research. Foxp3 can form a complex with the nuclear
factor of activated T (NFAT) cells and regulates the transcription of
several target genes including interleukin 2 (IL2) (9). Foxp3 confers
the suppressive phenotype on Tregs by inhibiting the activation of
target genes of T-cell stimulation (10). Furthermore, recent
evidence suggests that Foxp3 transcriptionally down-regulates
cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), and by reducing
this protein, Treg may enhance their metabolic fitness (11, 12).
In vitro studies have shown that transforming growth factor-h
(TGF-h) can impose a regulatory phenotype on CD4+ CD25
T cells through the induction of Foxp3 expression, most probably
through activation of Smads, which results in a positive
autoregulatory loop (13, 14). TGF-h signaling is also required for
the in vivo expansion and immunosuppressive capacity of adaptive
Tregs (15, 16). Furthermore, it has been shown that Tregs
specifically block CTL function through TGF-h signals in vivo
(17). In contrast, however, other studies have shown that the
development and functional capacity of CD4+CD25+ Treg is
normal in TGF-h1–deficient mice (18), questioning a role for
TGF-h1 (but not necessarily for TGF-h2 and TGF-h3) in mediating
Treg development and function. We reported earlier that the levels
of TGF-h1 and IL-10 were increased in the serum of pancreatic
cancer patients (19), which in turn might either directly or
indirectly affect the prevalence of Tregs in the local tumor
environment and in peripheral blood.
Pancreatic carcinoma cells are broadly resistant to common
chemo- and radiation therapy. In search for alternative therapeutic
approaches, immune-based therapies are the focus of current
research. Despite a measurable increase of tumor-specific CTLs
following the application of cancer vaccines, the clinical response
to tumor vaccines is still poor (20). To improve current concepts of
immune-based therapies, a broader understanding of local and
systemic immune escape mechanisms and the role of Tregs in
the suppression of immune responses in cancer patients is
important. A variety of local and systemic mechanisms of immune
escape in pancreatic cancer have been identified (21). It was
recently shown that the increased prevalence of Tregs can be
induced by pancreatic adenocarcinoma in vivo (22) and is
dependent on TGF-h secretion by the tumor cells. Moreover,
tumor cells can convert immature dendritic cells into TGF-h–
secreting cells, inducing Treg proliferation (23). These findings

support the concept that the tumor induces an increase of Tregs
via TGF-h secretion, which results in an inhibition of the immune
response against the tumor. Tumor cells have adopted inhibitory
mechanisms originally thought to be specific for cells of the
immune system, such as the ability to kill tumor-invading T cells
via the expression of Fas ligand (24). In this report, we show
another variation of this theme: the TGF-h2 and TGF-h type I
receptor/ALK5-dependent autoinduction of FoxP3, which enables
the tumor cells in vitro to suppress (potentially tumor-invading)
T cells via direct inhibition of their proliferation rather than
indirectly through Treg.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. Panc89 (also termed T3M4), Capan1, PancTu1,
and Panc1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS,
2 mmol/L glutamine, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen).
Panc1 cells stably transduced with a kinase-active version of ALK5 (T204D
mutation) have been shown previously to display high constitutive
expression of various TGF-h target genes (25).
Samples and immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples were collected
from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The present study was done
with the approval of the local ethics committee, and informed consent was
obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Immunohistochemical
staining of deparaffinized tumoral and peritumoral pancreatic tissue was

done according to standard protocols using Foxp3 antibody (PCH101 or
hFOXY, both from eBioscience). The staining intensities were graded as
strong, moderate, and weak, respectively, by a pathologist specialized in
pancreatic cancer.
Affymetrix chip analysis. Microdissected pancreatic carcinoma tissue
and normal pancreas tissue were analyzed using Affymetrix U133 chip.
Methods are described in detail in ref. 26.
TGF-B stimulation and Western blot analysis. Protein extracts were
prepared from cells stimulated with 5 ng/mL of recombinant human TGFh1, or TGF-h2, and 0.1 Ag/mL anti-TGFh2 antibody (all purchased from
R&D Systems). Following the determination of protein concentrations with
the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce), cellular lysates were
fractionated by PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. For Foxp3 detection, membranes were probed with hFOXY antibody
(1:100 dilution) overnight at 4jC followed by a secondary horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated antibody. Chemiluminescent detection was done
with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Bioscience).
Flow-cytometric analysis. Cells were washed in PBS containing 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% NaN3 before antibody staining,
followed by fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde. All antibodies were
purchased from BD Biosciences. A total of 105 events, gated for
lymphocytes, were collected using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Analysis
was done using the Cell Quest program (BD Biosciences).
Isolation of T cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
isolated from human peripheral blood from healthy donors by FicollHypaque gradient centrifugation. CD4+CD25 T cells were isolated using a

carcinoma, nuclear (top left) and cytoplasmic

observed. Foxp3-positive lymphocytes (arrows )
are likely tumor-infiltrating Tregs. In nonmalignant
peritumoral pancreatic tissues, no Foxp3-positive
duct cells were detected (bottom right ).

(Miltenyi Biotec), followed by magnetic separation on MACS columns.
TGF-B2 ELISA. TGF-h2 in culture supernatants of pancreatic tumor cell
lines was quantified with the TGF-h2 quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tumor cells were
seeded in six-well plates, and culture supernatants were harvested after
48 h. TGF-h2 concentrations were normalized to 1  106 cells/mL to
account for differences in cell numbers.
Small interfering RNA treatment. Panc89 cells were seeded in six-well
plates and treated with 300 nmol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting
Foxp3 or control siRNA together with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 4 h in
medium containing 0.5% FCS. Subsequently, cells were cultured in normal
growth medium. The following siRNA sequences were used (5¶!3¶): Foxp3
sense: GCACAUUCCCAGAGUUCC-UdTdT; Foxp3 antisense: AGGAACUCUGGGAAUGUG-CdTcT; control sense: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT; control antisense: ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGA-AdTdT.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA isolation from cell lines was
done using the Micro-to-Midi total RNA purification system (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Reverse transcription
was carried out using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and
random hexamers (Roche). Relative mRNA levels were determined by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) done with IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and
analyzed by the Opticon real-time PCR system using MJ Opticon Monitor
Analysis Software (Bio-Rad). Semiquantitative PCR was carried out by
applying standard conditions and including betaine (Sigma-Aldrich) in the
reaction mixture. The following primers were used (5¶!3¶): Foxp3 sense:
CACAACATGCGACCCCCTTTCACC; Foxp3 antisense: AGGTTGTGGCGGATGGCGTTCTTC; IL-6 sense: TCCACAAGCGCCTTCGGT; IL-6 antisense:
AGGTGAGTGGCTGTCTGTGT; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
sense: ACGTGATGCAGAACCACCTACTG; G6PD antisense: ACGACGGCTGCAAAAGTGGCG.
Coculture experiments and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester
proliferation assays. Three days after siRNA transfection, Panc89 cells
were trypsinized and seeded into six-well plates at 2  105 cells per well.
After cells had attached to the dishes, they were cocultured with 2  106
CD4+CD25 T cells for 3 days with Expander Beads (Miltenyi Biotec) using
X-Vivo 15 medium. T cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) before coculture by incubating them with 5 Amol/L
CFSE for 10 min at 37jC in PBS, followed by addition of ice-cold complete
medium and washing with PBS. Proliferation of T cells was measured by
flow cytometry on the basis of CFSE dilution and calculated as the ratio of
the number of proliferating over the total number of T cells.

(1). To further validate these results, semiquantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis from 13 patients with
pancreatic adenocarcinoma was conducted and revealed a
significant overexpression of Foxp3 in the tumor specimens
compared with seven cases of nonmalignant pancreatic tissues
(Fig. 1B). Furthermore, by immunohistochemistry, we detected
Foxp3 expression in tumor cells of 24/39 patients with pancreatic
carcinoma (Table 1). Because Foxp3 expression in malignant
epithelial cells was a novel and surprising observation, we
confirmed the staining results in 12 of the above 39 cases with
a different anti-Foxp3 antibody (hFOXY, data not shown). Foxp3
subcellular staining was mostly cytoplasmic in some patients
(Fig. 1C, bottom left), whereas in others, it seemed predominantly
nuclear (Fig. 1C, top left). Normal pancreatic duct cells were
devoid of Foxp3 expression (Fig. 1C, bottom right). In all patients,
Foxp3-positive, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (Fig. 1C, arrows),
presumably representing Treg, were detectable as reported
previously (4, 6). In this small series of patients with different
clinicopathologic characteristics (including patients with curative
tumor resection and palliative surgery), we were unable to find a
correlation between Foxp3 expression or subcellular localization
and tumor stage or survival. It has recently been shown that the
activation of Treg with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 induces a change in
the subcellular localization of Foxp3 from a more cytoplasmic/
perinuclear to a nuclear expression pattern, which may result

Results and Discussion
Detection of Foxp3 expression in pancreatic carcinoma
tissue. In an initial analysis of microdissected pancreatic
carcinoma tissue using Affymetrix chip technology, Foxp3 was
among the up-regulated genes in some tumor samples (26);
(Fig. 1A). This was in contrast to other studies that failed to
detect Foxp3 expression in nonhematopoietic cells and tissues

treated with TGF-h1 (5 ng/mL), TGF-h2 (5 ng/mL),

from post-translational modifications (27). Therefore, the heterogeneous subcellular localization of Foxp3 in pancreatic carcinoma
tissues may reflect the presence of different post-translationally
modified forms of Foxp3. The functional relevance of this finding
needs further investigation.
Foxp3 expression in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and upregulation by TGF-B2 but not TGF-B1. In accordance with the
immunohistochemistry data pointing to FoxP3 expression in
tumor cells (see above), Foxp3 expression was clearly detectable
in several pancreatic carcinoma cell lines at both mRNA (Fig. 2A)
and protein levels (Fig. 2B). It was recently described that
pancreatic cancer cells can, via secretion of TGF-h, promote the
prevalence of Treg (22), in part by converting CD4+CD25 T cells
to Treg (28). Treatment of Panc89, Capan1, and Panc1 cells with
TGF-h2 led to an up-regulation of the Foxp3 protein, which was
moderate for Panc89 and Capan1 and strong for Panc1 (Fig. 3A
and D). Surprisingly, treatment of Panc89 cells with TGF-h1 did
not change Foxp3 protein expression (Fig. 3A) despite the fact
that TGF-h1 rather than TGF-h2 induces FoxP3 expression
and converts CD4+CD25 T cells into CD4+CD25+ Treg (13, 14,
16, 28). RT-PCR analysis detected a 13-fold (mean value of four
independent experiments) increase of Foxp3 mRNA expression in
Panc89 cells after a 48-h stimulation with TGF-h2, whereas no
such effect was evident after stimulation with TGF-h1 (Fig. 3B).

www.aacrjournals.org

Pancreatic cancer cells are known to secrete biologically active
TGF-hs that might act in an autocrine fashion to enhance certain
TGF-h responses. Because the induction of Foxp3 by exogenously
applied TGF-h was comparatively weak, we tested the hypothesis
that the Foxp3 protein levels detected might be actually induced by
autocrine TGF-h(2) stimulation. This assumption was supported
by the observation that the concentrations of TGF-h2 in the
culture supernatants as measured by ELISA (Fig. 3C) correlated
positively with the expression levels of Foxp3 quantified by
densitometry (compared with Fig. 2B) in 3/4 cell lines analyzed
(Panc89, Colo357, PancTu1). Moreover, the incubation of Panc89
and Capan1 cells with anti–TGF-h2 antibody for 48 h clearly
suppressed the Foxp3 signal (Fig. 3A), suggesting that endogenously produced TGF-h2 maintains Foxp3 expression in pancreatic
cancer cell cultures.
TGF-h2 requires for high-affinity binding and signaling either the
coreceptor betaglycan (type III receptor), together with TGF-h
receptor type II (ThRII) and ALK5 (29), or an alternatively spliced
ThRII (termed ThRII-B; ref. 30). However, it was also reported that
TGF-h2 can signal independently from TbRIII or TbRII-B, provided
that ALK5, ThRII, or ThRII-B is sufficiently expressed (31). To
determine whether the activation of ALK5 alone can induce Foxp3
in pancreatic carcinoma cells, we employed Panc1 cells stably
expressing a constitutively active mutant (T204D, named Panc1

ALK5-TD) of ALK5. Strikingly, Foxp3 expression was dramatically
up-regulated in these cells and could not substantially be further
increased by exogenous TGF-h2 (Fig. 3D). Moreover, Panc1 cells
ectopically expressing a kinase-defective ALK5 mutant (K232R)
that acts in a dominant-negative fashion failed to respond to TGFh2 stimulation with the up-regulation of Foxp3 (data not shown).
The expression level of ALK5 [low in Panc89 (32) and high in Panc1
(25)] might thus determine the strength of the regulatory effect of
TGF-h2 on Foxp3.
TGF-h regulation of Foxp3 in Treg has been shown to involve
Smad signaling (13). However, in pancreatic cancer, this signaling
pathway is often nonfunctional due to mutations in Smad4 as
exemplified by the Capan1 line (33, 34), whereas Panc1, Panc89,
and Colo357 have retained a functional Smad pathway (32, 35).
Interestingly, although Capan1 culture supernatants contained the
highest amount of TGF-h2, they expressed only moderate
amounts of Foxp3, which may reflect inefficient Smad-mediated
transcriptional induction of the Foxp3 gene through TGF-h2,
along with a compensatory overproduction of TGF-h2. However,
the observation that Foxp3 expression was induced or suppressed
in response to TGF-h2 ligand or neutralizing anti–TGF-h2
antibody, respectively, may be taken as evidence for Smadindependent regulation. Clearly, more extensive analysis is
required to clarify the contribution of Smad and non-Smad
signaling to TGF-h regulation of Foxp3 expression in pancreatic
cancer cells.
Specific down-regulation of Foxp3 in pancreatic carcinoma
cells results in up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8. The control

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

of inflammatory cytokine production is a key function of Foxp3
in Treg. To analyze whether Foxp3 modulates cytokine secretion
in pancreatic carcinoma cells, Foxp3 expression was downregulated by means of siRNA transfection in Panc89 cells. This
cell line was chosen because both Capan1 and Colo357 cells,
although displaying higher Foxp3 expression, were refractory to
transfection with LipofectAMINE and other methods in our
hands. Treatment of Panc89 cells with Foxp3 siRNA resulted in a
strong down-regulation of both Foxp3 mRNA (Fig. 4A) and
protein (Fig. 4B). A screen for changes in cytokine secretion
in these cells using the Raybiotec Cytokine Array (Hoelzel
Diagnostica) revealed an increase of IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture
supernatant, whereas other cytokines remained unchanged (data
not shown). Specific analysis of IL-6 and IL-8 expression by
quantitative RT-PCR 48 h after transfection indicated 3.8-fold
higher levels of IL-6 and 4.6-fold higher levels of IL-8 mRNA in
Foxp3-siRNA–transfected cells relative to LipofectAMINE-treated
control cells (Fig. 4C). Because IL-6 gene expression is activated
by nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; ref. 36) and Foxp3 interacts with
NF-nB in Tregs and is able to repress cytokine gene expression
(37) through the inhibition of NF-nB transcriptional activity,
down-regulation of Foxp3 can promote IL-6 secretion via the
relief of NF-nB inhibition. Our observation that siRNA-mediated
suppression of Foxp3 resulted in the up-regulation of IL-6
suggests that in pancreatic cancer cells, Foxp3 operates in a
similar way. IL-8 is an angiogenic factor whose expression is also
dependent on NF-nB (38). IL-8 promotes growth of pancreatic
tumors; however, the functional significance of FoxP3-mediated

suppression of IL-8 secretion in these tumor cells is currently
not known.
Inhibition of T-cell proliferation in a coculture system is
dependent on Foxp3 expression in Panc89 cells. The results
presented thus far raised the possibility that not only is antitumor
immunity influenced by tumor-infiltrating Treg (3, 4, 22), but
also that pancreatic carcinoma cells themselves might modulate
T-cell function via expression of Foxp3. To evaluate the effect of
(Foxp3-expressing) pancreatic carcinoma cells on T-cell activation
and proliferation, Panc89 cells were cocultured with naive
CD4+CD25 T cells. After 3 days of coculture with anti-CD3
and anti-CD28 stimulus, proliferation of T cells was measured
using CFSE-labeling and flow cytometry analysis. In the cocultures, Colo357, Panc89, and PancTu1 tumor cells strongly
inhibited the proliferation of anti-CD3/anti-CD28–stimulated
T cells (Fig. 4D). This effect could not be overcome by exogenous
IL2 (data not shown). In contrast, no antiproliferative effect was
observed when tumor cells and T cells were separated by a
membrane using Transwell inserts (data not shown), suggesting
that cell-cell contact was important. To explore whether the
proliferation arrest in the coculture system was associated with a
lack of T-cell activation, we monitored the expression of various
activation antigens on the cell surface of activated T cells cultured
in the absence or presence of Panc89 cells. As shown in Fig. 5B,
CD25 GITR and CD69 were up-regulated after anti-CD3/anti-CD28
stimulation, irrespective of the presence or absence of tumor cells.
These data clearly show that tumor cells inhibit proliferation
rather than the activation of T cells.
To verify the presumed suppressive role of Foxp3 expression in
pancreatic tumor cells on T-cell proliferation, we repeated the
coculture experiments with Panc89 cells in which Foxp3 expression
had been silenced by siRNA. When using these cells, we observed
an f45% recovery of T-cell proliferation in the coculture system
(Fig. 5A). The percentage of proliferating T cells in the coculture
was increased from 3% to 28% as measured by CFSE staining.
Together, these results show that Panc89 cells inhibit, in a Foxp3dependent manner, the proliferation of naive T cells without
generally impeding their activation. Recent reports have shown
that tumor cells can induce Treg via secretion of TGF-h (22, 28, 39).
Blocking TGF-h in the coculture with anti–TGF-h2 antibody did
not reverse the antiproliferative effect on the T cells (data not
shown). In addition, in preliminary experiments, activated T cells
recovered from the coculture with the tumor cells did not suppress
proliferation of freshly isolated CD4+CD25 T cells (data not
shown). Therefore, we assume that the inhibition of T cell
proliferation in the coculture system was independent of the
induction of Tregs.
In summary, we show for the first time the ectopic expression
of Foxp3 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue and pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines. Our observations are novel in that Foxp3
expression was thought to be restricted to hematopoietic cells
and tissues. Its expression in epithelial cancer cells may represent
an example of molecular mimicry and reveals another mechanism
of immune evasion in pancreatic cancer. However, the function of
Foxp3 in tumor cells may be much more subtle because it has
been reported that it transcriptionally down-regulates intracellular PDE3B in Treg, which is associated with increased expression
of metabolic fitness genes, better survival, and reduced apoptosis
(after IL2–driven expansion; ref. 11). Because apoptosis resistance
is a hallmark of pancreatic tumors, it may be speculated that
Foxp3 confers a survival advantage on tumor cells in normal

tumor physiology and under chemotherapeutic stress. Given the
crucial role of TGF-h2 in maintaining Foxp3 expression, our
results are of immediate relevance in view of an ongoing phase
I/II study with a TGF-h2 antisense compound in pancreatic
carcinoma (40). Furthermore, these findings might open new
perspectives for immunotherapeutic strategies against this tumor

Figure 5. A, Panc89 cells were treated with siRNA against Foxp3. After 3 d,
Panc89 cells were cocultured with CD4+CD25 T cells for another 3 d
with Expander Beads. Proliferation of the T cells as determined by dilution of
CFSE staining intensity was measured by flow cytometry. The percentage of the
proliferating T cells is depicted for stimulated T cells alone (T cells stim. ) and
coculture of Panc89 cells with stimulated T cells after incubation with medium
alone (+medium ), Foxp3 siRNA (+siRNA ), LipofectAMINE (+lipo ), or control
siRNA (sictrl. ). Columns, mean values of two independent experiments; bars,
SD. Statistical significance was confirmed using two-paired t test. *, P = 0.04.
B, expression of activation markers on CD4+CD25 T cells after 3 d of
stimulation with CD3 and CD28 stimulus alone or in coculture with Panc89
pancreatic cancer cells. Cell surface expression of CD25, CD69, and GITR was
measured by FACS after stimulation of T cells alone or after coculture with
Panc89 cells. Bold line, specific staining for CD25 in forward-sideward scatter
and for CD69 and GITR relative to isotype staining (gray curve ).

type. Intriguingly, Foxp3 expression was detected in 60% of all
pancreatic carcinoma patients and in 4/4 pancreatic cancer cell
lines analyzed. Although the number of patients was too small to
establish a meaningful correlation between Foxp3 expression and
patient survival, the issue of whether Foxp3 might serve as a
prognostic marker has to be evaluated in a larger series of
patients.
