Abstract
Tumor progression requires ablation of suppressor functions mediated by transforming growth factor b
(TGFb) signaling and by oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), but how these functions are canceled in specific
subtypes of breast cancer remains unknown. In this study, we show that HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
avert TGFb- and OIS-mediated tumor suppression by switching expression of 2 functionally distinct isoforms of
the transcription factor C/EBPb, which has been implicated previously in breast cancer development. HER2
signaling activates the translational regulatory factor CUGBP1, which favors the production of the transcriptionally inhibitory isoform LIP over that of the active isoform LAP. LIP overexpression prevents the assembly of
LAP/Smad transcriptional repressor complexes on the MYC promoter in response to TGFb, and interferes with
activation of OIS responses. Treatment of HER2-transformed mammary epithelial cells with the HER2 antibody
trastuzumab reduces LIP levels, restoring these suppressor responses. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism
through which HER2 silences tumor suppression in a concerted manner, contributing to the potency of this
oncogene in breast cancer. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9927–36. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor
b (TGFb) and the cell senescence effects of oncogene-induced
senescence (OIS) are 2 critical barriers to tumor progression,
and their loss is a hallmark of cancer (1). In breast cancer,
resistance to TGFb is acquired by malfunctions that selectively
eliminate cytostatic gene responses but spare other TGFb
effects (2). When this occurs, tumor cells may turn their altered
TGFb signaling system to their advantage during local invasion
(3, 4), evasion of immune surveillance (5–7), or the formation of
metastases (3, 8–10). Previous work has delineated a TGFb
transcriptional program including key cytostatic gene
responses that are mediated by the Smad pathway (11). Interestingly, a subset of Smad-mediated gene responses, including
the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor

p15INK4b and the repression of MYC, has in common an
absolute requirement for C/EBPb. OIS is crucial in preventing
premalignant cells from progressing to overt malignancy (12,
13). It results in cell-cycle arrest by upregulation of the CDK
inhibitor p19INK4a, p16INK4a, or p15INK4b (12, 14). In certain
types of cancer, tumor cells fail to trigger OIS owing to the loss
of p16INK4a or p15INK4b, or the absence of Rb:E2F complexes
(14, 15). What leads to the malfunction of these tumor suppressor mechanisms remains poorly understood (16, 17).
The ERBB family of proteins comprises 4 receptor tyrosine
kinase family members (ERBB1–4), which contain a conserved
epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain. ERBB2 (HER2) gene
amplification and oncogenic mutations constitutively activate
the ERBB2 homodimeric tyrosine kinase activity and reduce
the growth factor dependence of ERBB2-amplified cells mainly
through prolonged stimulation of PI3 kinase (PI3K) and RAS/
RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (18). Aberrant expression of ERBB2 occurs in 25% to 30% of breast
cancers and has a direct role in the pathogenesis of this
disease, constituting a particularly aggressive subtype of
breast cancer (19, 20).
The human C/EBPb locus encodes 3 isoforms, LAP1, LAP2,
and LIP, by alternative usage of different start codons. LAP1
and LAP2 are transcriptional activators, whereas LIP lacks the
regulatory domain and functions as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the LAPs (21). C/EBPb mediates MYC downregulation by TGFb, induction of the prosenescence cytokines
IL6 and IL8 by OIS, and induction of the CDK inhibitor
p15INK4b by both TGFb and OIS (15, 22–24). Loss of C/EBPb
gene eliminates the ability of primary mouse fibroblasts to
restrain RAS- or BRAF-driven oncogenesis, and this p53independent mechanism is mediated by p19INK4a or

p15INK4b (15, 23, 25). Interestingly, C/EBPb cooperates with
Rb:E2F complexes both in TGFb-induced cytostasis and in OIS
biological processes (15, 24).
Much remains unknown about the individual functions of
each C/EBPb protein isoform in breast cancer cells (21). The
present investigation into how breast cancer cells avert tumor
suppressor controls led us to the finding that ERBB2 disables
specific TGFb and OIS responses by deregulating C/EBPb
isoform translation. We interrogated ERBB2-positive breast
cancer cells that are sensitive to trastuzumab as well as
metastatic cells from patients progressing on trastuzumab.
Our studies reveal a key role of C/EBPb isoform imbalance in
the loss of TGFb and OIS tumor suppressor mechanisms in
this breast cancer subtype.

Materials and Methods
Isolation of metastatic cells from pleural effusions
Patients with metastatic breast cancer and pleural effusion
who required thoracentesis were eligible to participate in this
Institutional Review Board–approved study. Informed consent was obtained prospectively at the time of fluid collection.
Metastatic cells were isolated as described in the work of
Gomis et al. (24). The pleural fluid was transferred to 250-mL
plastic tubes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,000 rpm at
4 C. The collected sample was mixed with PBS to a total
volume of 100 mL, centrifuged again, and decanted. Cells were
cultured for 24 hours and incubated with a specific epithelial
antibody (anti-EpCAM-APC Becton Dickinson) at a 1:50 dilution in PBS. Unstained cells and isotype antibody (anti-IgG1APC)-stained samples were used as controls. EpCAM-positive
cells were sorted using a FACS_ARIA (Becton Dickinson). All
pleural effusion cells were maintained at 5% CO2 and 37 C in
M199 media (Lonza) supplemented with 2.5% FBS, 10 mg/mL
of insulin (Sigma), 0.5 mg/mL of hydrocortisone (Sigma),
20 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 100 ng/
mL of cholera toxin (Gentaur), 1 mg/mL of fungizone, and
100 units/mL of penicillin/streptomycin.
Cell lines and transfections
All cell lines were purchased from ATCC in 2007. By testing
its INK4 locus deletion (p15INK4b by real-time quantitative
PCR, qPCR), MCF10A were authenticated. Moreover, the
number of HER2 and CEP17 gene copies was used to control
genomic stability. MCF10A(RAS) and MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2)
were derived from early MCF10A passage cells and subjected
to similar authentication procedures. SKBR3 and BT474 cells
were authenticated for HER2 amplification by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All cell lines, including
HaCaT, were cultured for less than 20 passages. Cell lines were
transfected with DNA by using Lipofectamine, following manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). TGFb (R&D Systems)
was used at 20 pmol/L.
Protein extraction and Western blot, RNA isolation,
real-time qPCR analysis
Cells were lysed with a buffer containing 2.5% SDS in
100 nmol/L of Tris (pH 7.5) for protein extracts and pro-

cessed as in Gomis et al. (24). The antibodies used were
ERBB2 (Upstate); C/EBPb, H-RAS, and CUGBP1 (Santa
Cruz); P-Smad2, AKT, P-AKT, p44/42 and P-p44/42, and
PTEN (Cell Signaling); and anti-Flag M2 HRP, a-tubulin
(Sigma). For RNA, cells were lysed in RTL buffer, homogenized using QIAshredder columns, and RNA purified
(Qiagen RNeasy). Reverse transcription was performed using
High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time qPCR was performed using the comparative CT method and ABI Prism Fast 7900HT Instrument
and the indicated TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Adherent cells were trypsinized, washed, and swollen in
0.075 mol/L of KCl before fixation in 3:1 methanol:acetic acid
and seeding onto slides. FISH for HER2 and CEP17 was
performed using the PathVysion HER-2 DNA probe KIT
(Abbot) following manufacture's instructions.
Overexpression constructs, shorthairpins,
and viral production
For LIP overexpression in MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) cells, an
N-terminal FLAG-tag LIP was cloned into the retroviral
vector pBabePuro. LAP2 expression vector was already
described (24). As a control, pBabePuro empty vector was
used. Shorthairpin RNAs (shRNA) were purchased from
Mission TRC shRNA library (Sigma). 293T packaging cells
were transfected with the viral vectors. Viral supernatants
were harvested 48 hours posttransfection, filtered (0.45
mmol/L), and then concentrated by centrifugation during
2 hours at 18,000 rpm. Infection was done in the presence of
8 mg/mL of polybrene for 48 hours. Cells were recovered with
fresh media and selected with 4 mg/mL of puromycin for 24
hours.
Immunofluorescence and senescence-associated
b-galactosidase staining
Cells grown on coverslips were washed with ice-cold PBS
twice, treated with ice-cold cytoskeleton buffer, and stained
for HP1g (MAB3450; Chemicon) and H3K9me (07-442;
Upstate) following manufacturer's instructions. Images were
acquired with a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope. SAb-gal staining was performed using a commercial kit (Cell
Signaling) and mounted in Vectashield media with DAPI.
Images were acquired with E600 Nikon epifluorescence
microscope.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were grown to 70% confluence, incubated in the
presence or absence of TGFb for 90 minutes, and subsequently
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for
15 minutes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described previously and according to manufacturer's instructions (Upstate). The antibodies used were
anti-Smad2/3 (24), anti-FoxO3 (H-144; Santa Cruz), anti-E2F4/
5 (Santa Cruz), and anti-C/EBPb (C-19; Santa Cruz). ChIP
results were quantified relative to the input amount and

studies. For subcutaneous implantation, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with PBS, and
counted. Resuspended cells (5  106 cells) in 50-mL growth
factor–reduced Matrigel were inoculated subcutaneously
(1 tumor per mouse) to anesthetized mice and growth
monitored weekly. Mice carrying tumors of size greater
than 100 mm3 were included in our experimental design
and treated with trastuzumab (20 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneal injection twice a week. Growth rates were analyzed by measuring tumor length (L) and width (W), and

Results
High LIP/LAP molar ratio and loss of tumor suppressor
responses in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells
Breast cancer malignant progression requires the elimination of tumor suppressor signals imparted both by TGFb
and by OIS. Because both tumor suppressor mechanisms
have in common a requirement for C/EBPb, we hypothesized that deregulation of C/EBPb isoforms could cancel
these mechanisms in specific subtypes of breast cancer. To
this end, we analyzed these tumor suppressor responses in
malignant cells that were freshly obtained from the pleural
fluid of patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer
(Supplementary Fig. 1). MYC repression by TGFb, which is an
important part of the TGFb tumor suppressive response,
was absent in a subset of these samples (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Table 1). Of note, in these breast cancer
samples, TGFb receptor signal transduction was functional
as determined by the induction of receptor-dependent
Smad2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 2C) and the
induction of a typical, noncytostatic, Smad2-dependent gene
response such as the induction of Smad7 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the 2 patient-derived cell samples that did not

downregulate MYC expression in response to TGFb showed
a low incidence of flat, enlarged, and multinucleated senescence features over 2 weeks in culture (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Western immunoblotting analysis revealed striking
differences in the relative level of LIP in this set of samples
(Fig. 1B). Notably, a high LIP/LAP molar ratio (>1.0) was
observed only in samples originated from patients bearing
primary tumors annotated as ERBB2 positive (2þ/FISHþ
and 3þ) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, LIP upregulation coincided
with loss of MYC repression by TGFb and senescence (Fig. 1A
and B and Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1). Samples
derived from an initial diagnosis of ERBB2 amplification
or overexpression were confirmed to have 2.5- to 3-fold
higher ERBB2 mRNA levels than ERBB2-negative cells and
to carry 3 or more copies of the ERBB2 gene as determined
by FISH (Fig. 1B and C). Collectively, these results suggest a
possible link between ERBB2 hyperactivity, high LIP levels,
and loss of both tumor suppressor mechanisms in human
breast cancer metastatic cells.

ERBB2 controls LIP translation
Given the limited availability of patient-derived pleural
fluids of the various breast cancer subtypes, we turned to
suitable experimental model systems in order to investigate
the mechanistic link between ERBB2 and LIP expression.
BT474 and SKBR3 are ERBB2-overexpressing human breast
cancer cell lines (26, 27). MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) is a derivative
of nontumor mammary cell line MCF10A stably expressing
ERBB2 and HRAS oncogenes (28). Analysis of C/EBPb isoform
levels in these cell lines showed a high LIP/LAP molar ratio in
all 3 cell lines compared with MCF10A breast epithelial cells
(Fig. 2A). ERBB2 signaling activity was sufficient to deregulate
C/EBPb isoform ratios in HRAS-transformed MCF10A cells
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 3).
To address the mechanism by which ERBB2 drives LIP
expression, we used a combined pharmacologic and genetic
approach targeting ERBB2 and its downstream signaling
mediators. Treatment of BT474, SKBR3, and MCF10A(RAS/
ERBB2) cells with trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal

antibody against ERBB2, caused a reduction in ERBB2 signaling as measured by a decrease in phosphorylated AKT [(PAKT); (29); Fig. 2B]. Trastuzumab also slightly inhibited MAPK
activation (p44/42 phosphorylation) in BT474 and SKBR3 cells
but not in MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) cells, in which RAS drives
MAPK activation (Fig. 2B). These effects were associated with
a decrease in LIP expression and LIP/LAP molar ratio in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). To further validate this
observation, we knocked down ERBB2 by means of a specific
shRNA in SKBR3 cells, leading to a decrease in the LIP/LAP
molar ratio (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 4A). Conversely,
the induction of ERBB2 overexpression in the ERBB2-negative
MCF7 breast cancer cell line led to an increase in LIP levels
over LAP ones (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the treatment of BT474
cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 led to a decrease in the
LIP levels (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Interestingly, trastuzumab
and LY294002 did not cause a drop in the LIP/LAP molar ratio
in patient-derived BCN6 and CN37 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2A and B; data not shown). Note that these samples were
obtained from patients with a diagnosis of ERBB2-positive
breast cancer who failed trastuzumab and other therapies,
suggesting that trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer is
accompanied with the retention of a high LIP/LAP ratio.
LIP expression is controlled by alternative translation; thus,
we sought to clarify which mediator is responsible for ERBB2driven LIP expression. We focused on the potential role of the
translation mediators CUGBP1 and EIF4E as downstream
targets of ERBB2 (21, 30–33). No correlation between EIF4E

loss of function and LIP expression was observed in MCF10A
cells (data not shown). EGF receptor signaling has been
suggested to induce LIP levels by means of changes in the
activation status of the translational regulator CUGBP1 (34).
Indeed, RAS/ERBB2 overexpression increased and trastuzumab treatment decreased CUGBP1 protein levels in MCF10A
and BT474 cells, respectively (Fig. 2D). MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2)
and BT474 cells with 95% reduction in CUGBP1 levels by
RNAi-mediated knockdown showed a reduction in LIP expression, with little or no effect on the other C/EBPb isoforms
(Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. 5A and B).
ERBB2 averts TGFb growth arrest by switching
C/EBPb isoforms
MCF10A mammary epithelial cells exhibit a strong growth
inhibitory response to TGFb, and C/EBPb is central to this
response. C/EBPb knockdown in MCF10A cells prevented
MYC repression by TGFb, consistent with a pivotal role of C/
EBPb in this gene response (Supplementary Fig. 6). The
growth inhibitory effect of TGFb is absent in MCF10Aoverexpressing HRAS and ERBB2 (28). Treatment of
MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) cells with trastuzumab caused a
reduction in cell proliferation 72 hours posttreatment (Supplementary Fig. 4C). Moreover, it also restored the ability of
these cells to respond to TGFb, with inhibition of MYC
expression and suppression of cell proliferation (Fig. 3A
and B). To confirm the role of LIP as the suppressor of
TGFb cytostatic responses in ERBB2-overexpressing cells,

90 minutes and subjected to ChIP
assays with the indicated
antibodies and PCR primers for
the proximal region of the MYC
promoter. b-ACTIN promoter was
used as a negative control for
normalization. Data are
representative of 4 independent
experiments. C, immunoblots with
the indicated antibodies were

from cells under conditions
described in B.

we transduced MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) cells with LIP expression vector. The overexpression of LIP made the MYC
response to TGFb resistant to trastuzumab (Fig. 3A and B
and Supplementary Fig. 7). Furthermore, in MCF10A(RAS/
ERBB2) cells with RNAi-mediated depletion of CUGBP1, we
observed a restoration of the ability to downregulate MYC in
response to TGFb (Fig. 3C). Other TGFb gene responses,
including induction of SMAD7, plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1), and interleukin-11 (IL-11) were unaffected by
the knockdown of CUGBP1 (Supplementary Fig. 5C). No
restoration of MYC repression by TGFb was observed upon
treatment of BCN6 and CN37 cells with trastuzumab (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B; data not shown).
TGFb signaling directs the formation of a C/EBPb–
Smad2/3–E2F4/5 protein complex that binds to the TGFb
inhibitory element (TIE) on the MYC promoter in human
epithelial cells [(24); Fig. 4A]. C/EBPb knockdown and LIP
overexpression prevented the recruitment of C/EBPb,
Smad2/3, and E2F4/5 to the MYC promoter (Supplementary
Fig. 8), whereas TGFb failed to induce this TIE-binding
complex in MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) cells (Fig. 4B). Trastuzumab treatment of MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) restored the ability
of TGFb to induce binding of C/EBPb, Smad2/3, and E2F4/5
to the MYC promoter (Fig. 4B) without altering the levels of
Smad2/3 or E2F4/5, or the TGFb receptor–mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 4C). These effects were specific,
as binding of both Smad2/3 and FoxO3 to the distal region of
the p21CIP1 promoter in a TGFb-inducible manner was
preserved under these conditions (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Collectively, these results couple oncogene ERBB2 signaling
to the upregulation of LIP and an LIP-mediated inhibition of
the formation of the TGFb MYC repressor complex.

by ERBB2 hyperactivity might compromise OIS in addition
to TGFb tumor suppressor response. In MCF10A cells, RAS
overexpression led to OIS features including an accumulation of b-galactosidase activity (SA-b-Gal) under conditions
of low mitogen stress (Fig. 5A). This response was dependent
on C/EBPb, as it was decreased upon C/EBPb depletion
(Fig. 5A), and was accompanied with increased expression of
IL-6 (Supplementary Fig. 10A). Notably, the overexpression
of LIP in MCF10A(RAS) also inhibited OIS (Fig. 5A). In
contrast to MCF10A(RAS) cells, MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) cells
did not show a significant increase in SA-b-Gal enzymatic
activity under stress conditions (Fig. 5B and quantification
in Supplementary Fig. 10B). Trastuzumab treatment, which
decreases LIP levels, led to a significant increase in OIS, as
measured either by SA-b-Gal activity or by the colocalization
of H3K9Me and HP1g (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. 10B
and C). These observations were also recapitulated in the
ERBB2-positive breast cancer cell line BT474 (Fig. 5C). Moreover, overexpression of LIP in MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) or
BT474 cells prevented the ability of trastuzumab to induce
OIS, thus pointing toward a causal role for LIP (Fig. 5B
and C). These results suggested that ERBB2 overrides RAStriggered OIS potentially through LIP.
We previously observed that the normalization of the LIP/
LAP molar ratio by means of LAP2 expression conferred breast
cancer cells with the ability to downregulate MYC in response
to TGFb. LAP2 overexpression in BCN6, CN37, BT474, and
SKBR3 cells caused a significant increase in cellular senescence (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. 10D). Collectively, these
results indicate that TGFb-induced cytostasis and OIS are
linked by a mechanism based on C/EBPb transcription factor
isoform regulation.

ERBB2 evades OIS by increasing LIP levels
As an inducer of p15INK4b and IL-6 expression, C/EBPb
also plays an important role in OIS (23, 24). Therefore, we
investigated whether a functional defect in C/EBPb caused

Figure 5. ERBB2 inhibition restores oncogene-induced senescence by changes in the LIP/LAP molar ratio. A, MCF10A wild-type or MCF10A(RAS)
cells with the indicated RNAi or overexpression vectors were treated in low serum conditions for 48 hours to induce OIS. More than 200 cells/slide were scored
for SA-b-Gal activity. Data are mean  SD (n ¼ 4) and (n ¼ 5), respectively. B, (RAS/ERBB2)- and (RAS/ERBB2/F-LIP)-expressing MCF10A cells were treated in
low serum conditions þ/ trastuzumab (10 mg/mL) for 72 hours to induce OIS. Images of SA-b-Gal activity and immunofluorescence with the indicated
antibodies were obtained. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. Scale bar, 100 and 50 mm. C, control and (F-LIP) MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) and
BT474 cells were treated as in A for 72 hours and SA-b-Gal activity was measured. Data are mean  SD (n ¼ 3). D, control- and (LAP2)-expressing
patient-derived metastatic breast cancer (CN37 and BCN6) cells and BT474 and SKBR3 were treated and scored for SA-b-Gal activity as in A. Data are

established model procedure for the analysis of trastuzumab
effectiveness (35, 36). Mice bearing tumors greater than
100-mm3 size were randomly allocated to treatment with
vehicle or trastuzumab (20 mg/kg) biweekly [(37); Fig. 6A].
Over the next 28 days, trastuzumab arrested the growth of
MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) tumors (n ¼ 7; Fig. 6B). In contrast, LIPexpressing MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) tumors grew at a constant
rate during trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 6B). Tumors developed by MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) cells were differentiated squamous epithelial carcinomas (Fig. 7A). Tissue examination after
sacrifice confirmed Flag-LIP (F-LIP) overexpression, as
observed by specific tagged nuclear staining of tumor cells
(black arrows, Fig. 7A). Evidence of trastuzumab treatment
was also observed by a strong reduction in phospho-ERBB2
levels at the cellular membranes detected by immunohistochemistry both in MCF10A(RAS/ERBB2) control and in LIPexpressing treated tumors (Fig. 7A). In all conditions, tumors

showed TGFb signaling activity as detected by phosphoSmad2 levels (Fig. 7A). Trastuzumab-treated MCF10A(RAS/
ERBB2) tumors showed an increase in SA-b-Gal enzymatic
activity compared with untreated tumors, indicating the presence of tumor cells undergoing OIS (Fig. 7A). Interestingly,
trastuzumab treatment of LIP-expressing MCF10A(RAS/
ERBB2) tumors did not cause an increase in SA-b-Gal enzymatic activity but an increase in MYC protein levels, even
though this treatment caused a reduction in endogenous LIP
levels (Fig. 7A and B).

Discussion
The present results show that in metastatic breast cancer
cells, ERBB2 overexpression is associated with evasion of both
TGFb-induced cytostasis and OIS responses. ERBB2 promotes
tumor formation through mitogenic effects (18). Among other
mechanisms, it has been suggested that ERBB2 disables TGFb

cytostatic responses (16). We show that hyperactivation of
ERBB2 in patient-derived metastatic breast cancer samples
leads to an increase in the inhibitory C/EBPb isoform LIP over
that of transcriptionally active isoform LAP (Fig. 6C). Although
diverse translational regulation factors may control LIP levels
(30, 31, 33, 34), our analysis identifies CUGBP1 as a downstream effector of ERBB2/PI3K pathway that controls LIP
expression in metastatic breast cancer cells. Inhibition of PI3K
activity prevents LIP translation irrespectively of ERBB2 status
in these cells. These changes in LIP expression determine the
ability of breast cancer cells both to undergo OIS and to
assemble a TGFb-induced MYC repressor Smad complex
(Fig. 6C).
MYC is a direct transcriptional target of the Smad–C/EBPb–
E2F4/5 complex and its downregulation is central in TGFb
cytostatic response in breast epithelial cells. ERBB2-driven LIP
expression prevents the binding of the Smad–LAP–E2F4/5
repressive complex to the MYC promoter. This repressive
complex requires functional p107 or p130 Rb family members.
Similarly, C/EBPb has been shown to require E2F and Rbpocket protein family members to trigger OIS in mouse fibroblasts (15). High levels of MYC are required for continuous
suppression of TGFb-induced cytostasis and BRAFE600induced senescence (38–40). Induction of p15INK4b and
p21CIP1 is key to TGFb-induced cytostasis (38, 41) and
together with p16INK4A and p19INK4A is necessary for OIS
depending on the context (23, 42, 43). Interestingly, both tumor
suppressor mechanisms parallel on the function of C/EBPb
transcription factor, which we have highlighted in the present
work. The relationship between both tumor suppressor
mechanisms is quite tight in some contexts. For example,
TGFb signaling and Smad function are required for RASinduced senescence (44, 45). This raises the possibility that
TGFb could facilitate cell arrest in G0 prior to commitment to
stress-induced senescence, which remains an important open
question. The pivotal role of C/EBPb in both pathways makes
its dysfunction a double asset for breast cancer cells. Moreover,
the present findings indicate that TGFb cytostasis and OIS
programs remain dormant in ERBB2-positive breast cancer
cells and can be reactivated upon trastuzumab treatment.
Unlike inhibition of certain oncogenes deprives tumor cells
from a growth advantage, the inhibition of ERBB2 additionally
triggers tumor suppressor mechanisms, including TGFbinduced growth arrest and senescence in breast cancer cells.
Routine first-line treatment of ERBB2-positive patients
includes a regimen of chemotherapy targeting cell-cycle division (taxanes) together with trastuzumab followed by trastuzumab alone for more than 1 year (20). Our results suggest
that besides blocking promitogenic stimuli, trastuzumab
treatment may reactivate, among others, TGFb and OIS tumor
suppressor mechanisms. In trastuzumab therapeutic regimens, this reactivation of tumor suppressor mechanisms
may contribute to arrest tumor cell proliferation. This might
turn into an advantage for a subset of cancer cells, as it
increases the probability of escape from antimitogenic drugs,
such as taxanes and DNA damage agents. Interestingly, the
response rate in a trastuzumab dose escalation study (46) of
patients who had not received chemotherapy was comparable

with that obtained with drug combination regimens, trastuzumab with either anthracycline þ cyclophosphamide or
paclitaxel (19). Our present results could be an explanation
to these observations.
ERBB2-positive breast cancers treated with standard trastuzumab/chemotherapy undergo long periods of remission.
However, these tumors may eventually develop resistance to
trastuzumab and progress through therapy. Recently, it was
reported that either PI3K pathway mutations or compensatory ERBB3 phophorylation could account for trastuzumab
resistance (36, 47–49). On the basis of the present results, it
will be worth defining in larger cohorts whether alterations in
C/EBPb isoform expression also account for trastuzumab
resistance in breast cancer patients. We show that the antiproliferative function of trastuzumab could be attenuated in a

levels of LIP, which interfere with the ability of trastuzumab to
restore TGFb, OIS, and may be other tumor suppressor
mechanisms. These results point at C/EBPb isoform imbalance as a candidate key determinant of therapeutic success
in ERBB2-positive breast cancer. Moreover, they may give
rise to trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy regimens with
different administration timing in order to reach ERBB2
inhibition–produced arrested cells with antimitotic agents.
