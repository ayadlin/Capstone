Abstract
Melanoma progression is associated with the expression of different growth factors, cytokines, and
chemokines. Because TGFb1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved not only in physiologic processes but also in
cancer development, we analyzed in A375 human melanoma cells, the effect of TGFb1 on monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression, two known factors responsible for
melanoma progression. TGFb1 increased the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 in A375 cells, an effect mediated by
the cross-talk between Smad, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT, and BRAF-MAPK (mitogen activated
protein kinase) signaling pathways. Supernatants from TGFb1-treated A375 cells enhanced MCP-1–dependent
migration of monocytes, which, in turn, expressed high levels of TGF,b1, bFGF, and VEGF mRNA. Moreover, these
supernatants also inhibited functional properties of dendritic cells through IL-10–dependent mechanisms.
When using in vitro, the TGFb1-blocking peptide P144, TGFb1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation, and
expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 were inhibited. In vivo, treatment of A375 tumor–bearing athymic mice with
P144 significantly reduced tumor growth, associated with a lower macrophage infiltrate and decreased
intratumor MCP-1 and VEGF levels, as well as angiogenesis. Finally, in C57BL/6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma
tumors, when administered with immunotherapy, P144 decreased tumor growth and intratumor IL-10 levels,
linked to enhanced activation of dendritic cells and natural killer cells, as well as anti-OVA T-cell responses.
These results show new effects of TGFb1 on melanoma cells, which promote tumor progression and
immunosuppression, strongly reinforcing the relevance of this cytokine as a molecular target in melanoma.

Introduction
TGFb1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a relevant role in
the progression of cancer due to its effect on cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and
metastasis (1). Also, it has been described that TGFb1 induces
the expression of integrins and alters the composition of
extracellular matrix by activating the production of matrix
metalloproteinases, which favor the invasion of tumor cells.
Moreover, TGFb1 enhances angiogenesis by activating the
expression of proangiogenic factors such as interleukin (IL)-8
and VEGF (2). This molecule also exerts immunoregulatory

functions by inhibiting proliferation, activation, and differentiation of lymphocytes (3) as well as the function of natural
killer (NK) cells (4) and dendritic cells (DC; ref. 5), which leads
to the suppression of the antitumor immune response.
TGFb1 has been described as an important factor in the
development of melanoma. Although it has antiproliferative
effects on premalignant cells, as that occurs in normal melanocytes, advanced melanoma cells become resistant to this
suppressive effect and they can use TGFb1 to enhance their
invasive and metastatic phenotype (6). Tumor cells evade the
suppressive effect of TGFb1 through receptor- or Smad-inactivating mutations (7, 8) or by downstream signaling alterations. These modifications avoid the suppressive pathway and
induce prometastatic processes (9). Although no genetic
mutations of TGFb1 classical signaling molecules have been
identified in melanoma, a cross-talk between the Smad signaling pathway and other pathways, including Ras/MEK [MAP/
extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) kinase]/ERK, and
Akt, which are constitutively activated in a large percentage of
cutaneous melanomas, has been described (2, 10).
The majority of malignant melanoma cells overexpress
different growth factors and cytokines, which enhance growth
rate and invasiveness by their autocrine and paracrine effects

Induction of MCP-1 and IL-10 by TGFb1 in Melanoma

(11). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a potent
chemokine that recruits macrophages, is expressed by malignant but not by normal melanocytes (12). Accordingly, a
common feature of melanoma is the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages. These cells produce factors, which may
help tumor invasion, as well as the production of angiogenic
factors, which facilitate the formation of a vascular bed that
can support tumor development (13). Another factor common
in melanoma is IL-10. Its expression has been shown in vitro in
many melanoma cell lines (14), and in vivo, in primary and in
metastatic melanoma lesions (15). Moreover, elevated levels of
IL-10 have been observed in the sera of patients with advanced
melanoma and correlate with tumor progression (16).
Because TGFb1 has been shown to increase melanoma
progression and enhance its aggressive phenotype, due to
the important effects of MCP-1 and IL-10 have on melanoma
malignancy, we hypothesized that TGFb1 might play a role on
the expression of these molecules in melanoma cells. Thus, we
studied the effect of TGFb1 on A375 melanoma cells by
measuring the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 as well as
the consequences that expression of these factors had on
melanoma progression. Moreover, the signaling pathways
involved in the TGFb1-induced MCP-1 and IL-10 expression
were also studied. Finally, as described in more detail in the
following text, we showed that P144, a peptide inhibitor of
TGFb1, had beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo, by inhibiting
TGFb1-induced mechanisms associated with melanoma
development and immunosuppression.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Cell lines A375 and YAC-1 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were thawed and
passaged according to ATCC guidelines for less than 6 months
from the time that they were received or thawed. The ATCC
authenticates cell lines by DNA fingerprinting by short tandem
repeat analysis. B16-OVA cells were obtained from Dr. G.
Kroemer (Paris, France) in 2009. No authentication was done,
but the expression of OVA antigen and MHC-I molecules was
tested before the experiments. Cell lines were maintained in
DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS
(Gibco), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), and 4.5 g/L
glucose (Sigma).
Stimulation of A375 cells with TGFb1
A375 cells were cultured in 96-well plates (3  104 per well)
and stimulated with TGFb1 (R&D Systems; 1 ng/mL) in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. After
24 to 48 hours, supernatants were harvested to measure MCP-1
and IL-10. In some experiments, TGFb1 was preincubated at
37 C for 1 hour with anti-human TGFb1 (1 mg/mL), rat IgG
control isotype (BD-Pharmingen), the TGFb1 inhibitor peptide
P144 (50–200 mg/mL; ref. 17) or a control 15-mer peptide
(P301; NNTRKRIRIQRGPGR) that does not bind to TGFb1
(both from NeoMPS). To determine the signaling pathways
involved in the production of MCP-1 and IL-10 by A375 cells,

Smad3 inhibitor SIS3 (Calbiochem), mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPK)/ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (Promega), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem), all at 10 mmol/L, or DMSO were preincubated with
A375 cells 30 minutes before the addition of TGFb1. Expression
of phosphorylated forms of Smad3, AKT, and ERK1/2 induced
by TGFb1 (2 ng/mL) was assessed by Western blotting in A375
lysates from cells cultured in 6-well plates (3  105 per well) in
serum-free DMEM for 1 hour. In some experiments, TGFb1 was
preincubated at 37 C for 1 hour with P144 or control peptide
(50–200 mg/mL).
Generation of melanoma conditioned medium from
stimulated A375 cells
Melanoma conditioned media from A375 cells treated with
or without TGFb1 (TGFb-MCM and MCM, respectively) used
in functional in vitro experiments with monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs were produced by culturing A375 cells in 6well plates (2.5  105 per well) in DMEM with or without
TGFb1 (2 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Then, cells were washed twice
with medium to remove TGFb1 and maintained in culture for
an additional 48 hours.
Western blot analysis
One hour after cell stimulation with TGFb1 as described
earlier, cells were washed with PBS, lysed with RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer in the presence of protease
and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostic GmbH), and
precipitated proteins (30 mg) were resolved on 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gels. After transference onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad), nonspecific binding was blocked with
10% nonfat milk in 10 mmol/L Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween 20. Phosphorylated Smad3, AKT, and ERK1/2
were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-phospho Smad3 (1:1,000; Chemicon), AKT (1:1,000; Cell Signaling),
and MAP kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling). Actin
was also analyzed for control evaluation with rabbit anti-actin
(1:2,000; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Finally, an ECL anti-rabbit
IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences)
plus the Lumi-Light Western Blotting Substrate (Roche Diagnostic GmbH) was used to develop the proteins bands in films
scanned with the Curix-60 (AGFA).
Monocyte migration assay
Monocytes were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by positive selection with CD14-coated beads
(Miltenyi). In all cases, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were obtained from healthy donors after informed consent,
following a protocol in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Then, monocytes (5  105) were plated in 100 mL of
complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin) in the top chamber of 5-mm pore membrane
Transwells (Costar), with 5 mg/mL rat anti-human MCP-1
antibody (R&D Systems) or rat IgG control isotype
(BD-Pharmingen) when required. The bottom chamber was
filled with 500 mL of DMEM, MCM, or TGFb1-MCM. In some
cases, melanoma conditioned media were incubated with

anti-human MCP-1 antibody or rat IgG for 1 hour at 37 C prior
to the addition of media to Transwell plates. After 4 hours, the
number of monocytes in the lower chamber was counted by
flow cytometry as described (18).
Culture of DCs in TGFb1-MCM
Monocyte-derived DCs obtained as described (18) were
cultured in 96-well plates (105 in 200 mL per well) in RPMI
with DMEM, MCM, or TGFb1-MCM (proportion 4:1) for
6 hours. Then, DCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS; 1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and after 24 hours, production
of TNFa and IL-12 was measured in culture supernatants by
ELISA. The role of IL-10 was assessed by preincubating MCM
with rat anti-human IL-10 monoclonal antibody (Bioscience)
or control isotype (BD-Pharmingen; 1 mg/mL) before their
addition to DC cultures.
Mixed leukocyte reaction
Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) were carried out by
stimulating in 96-well plates nonadherent (CD14) cells (2 
105 per well) obtained from healthy donors with 104 allogeneic
DCs for 5 days. DCs were previously matured with LPS (1 mg/mL)
in the presence of A375 MCM (4:1) or TGFb1-MCM (4:1) for 24
hours. Cells were pulsed with 0.5 mCi per well of [3H]thymidine
for the last 18 hours and proliferation was measured. To
measure the production of IFNg by stimulated lymphocytes,
100 mL of culture supernatants was harvested on day 3.
ELISA
Human or murine TGFb1, MCP-1, IL-10, VEGF, TNFa, IL12, and IFNg from tumor homogenates, serum, or supernatants of DC, NK, or T-cell cultures were measured by
ELISA kits (BD Bioscencies) following the manufacturer
instructions.
RT-PCR
Monocytes and DC (1  105/200 mL per well) were cultured
for 24 hours in 96-well plates in RPMI with DMEM, MCM, or
TGFb1-MCM (proportion 1:1). Total RNA extraction from
cultures and real-time PCR were carried out as described
(19) using specific primers for each gene (Table 1). Results
were normalized according to b-actin. The amount of each
transcript was expressed by the formula: 2DCt [DCt ¼ Ct
(b-actin)  Ct(gene)].

Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with P144
Inhibition of TGFb1 effect on melanoma progression was
determined in 6- to 8-week-old female, athymic, nudeFoxn1nu and in C57BL/6 mice (Harlan). They were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions and treated
according to guidelines of our institution after study
approval by the review committee. A375 cells (106) were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank of athymic nude
mice and when the tumor diameter reached 5 mm, animals
were treated intraperitoneally with P144 (100 mg per mouse)
or vehicle (PBS) daily during 21 days. Tumor size was
monitored and animals were sacrificed when tumors
reached 15 mm. Tumor volume (V) was calculated as follows:
V ¼ (1/2)ab2, where a and b are the longest and shortest
tumor diameters, respectively.
C57BL/6 mice were injected intradermally with 105 B16-OVA
cells and when the tumor diameter reached 5 mm (day 0), they
received an intratumor injection of OVA (500 mg), poly(I:C)
(50 mg), and agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies (50 mg). On days 2
and 4, they were injected only with poly(I:C) and anti-CD40.
P144 (100 mg per mouse) or vehicle was administered daily
intraperitoneally from day 0 to day 7. At day 7, they were
sacrificed for immunologic assays.
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors
A375 tumor–bearing athymic mice, treated daily with
P144 or vehicle, were sacrificed after 8 days of treatment.
Tumors were resected and macrophage infiltrate was studied by immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor sections
were incubated for 2 hours with rat anti-F4/80 antibody
(1:400; eBiosciences) at 4 C overnight, followed by incubation with 1:200 horseradish peroxidase–conjugated rabbit
anti-rat IgG antibody (DakoCytomation) during 30 minutes.
Finally, peroxidase activity was visualized using DABþ Chromogen (DakoCytomation) as a substrate and sections were
counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. Macrophage infiltrate was measured by counting the number of pixels
corresponding with immunostained cells from digital
images using the Adobe Photoshop CS3 program as
described (20).
Angiogenesis
Tumor angiogenesis was also analyzed in nude mice by
injecting A375 tumor cells (106) mixed with Matrigel. Seven

measured as described (21). In some experiments, mice
received 35 mg of anti-MCP-1 neutralizing antibodies (R&D
Systems) or isotype control (BioXcell) 1, 4, and 6 days after
tumor inoculation.

TGFb1 increases MCP-1 and IL-10 expression in A375
cells by the cross-talk between Smad, AKT, and MAPK/
ERK signaling pathways
To study the effect of TGFb1 on MCP-1 and IL-10, two
known factors associated with melanoma progression, A375
melanoma cells were treated with this cytokine. Although this
cell line does not produce TGFb1 in vitro (data not shown), we
found that it can be detected both in A375 tumor homogenates (181  77 pg/mg of protein) and in the serum of A375
tumor-bearing athymic mice (13.5  2.3 ng/mL vs. 7.3 ng/mL
in control mice). Although MCP-1 was constitutively
expressed by A375 cells, the addition of TGFb1 significantly
increased its expression after 48 hours of culture (Fig. 1A). No
detectable expression was found in untreated cultures in the
presence of IL-10, whereas a clear induction was observed at
24 and 48 hours in the presence of TGFb1 (Fig. 1B).

To characterize signaling pathways involved in the induction of these factors, Western blot experiments were carried
out to measure phosphorylation of Smad3 as well as AKT and
ERK1/2 kinases. It was found that in A375 cells, TGFb1
induced phosphorylation of the canonical pathway molecule
Smad3 but no increase in phosphorylated AKT and ERK
kinases over basal constitutive levels was observed
(Fig. 1C). However, by using specific inhibitors of Smad3
(SIS3), PI3K/AKT (LY294002), and MAPK/ERK (U0126) during
stimulation experiments, it was found that MCP-1 production
was dependent on all 3 molecules whereas IL-10 production
depended on Smad3 and MAPK/ERK-related pathways
(Fig. 1D).
TGFb1 enhances MCP-1–mediated monocyte migration
Because TGFb1 increased the production of MCP-1 in A375
cells, we tested whether MCM from A375 cell cultures could
enhance monocyte migration. In vitro Transwell experiments
showed that TGFb1-MCM from A375 cells had a higher
chemoattractive activity on monocytes than that observed

with MCM from untreated A375 cells or complete medium
(DMEM), an MCP-1–dependent effect (Fig. 2A). To evaluate
the relevance of an increase in intratumor monocyte infiltration mediated by TGFb1, we measured the expression of VEGF
and bFGF in monocytes, two essential factors involved in the
progression of melanoma. Interestingly, MCM and TGFb1MCM induced a similar increase in mRNA expression of both
proangiogenic factors (Fig. 2B and C). Moreover, culture
supernatants from untreated or TGFb1-stimulated A375 cells
increased the expression of TGFb1 mRNA in monocytes
(Fig. 2D). Thus, although TGFb1 does not directly enhance
the ability of monocytes to produce angiogenic factors, it may
enhance the proangiogenic environment by increasing the
number of infiltrating monocytes, a similar phenomenon as
that described for smooth muscle cells (22, 23).
Inhibition of DC functions by TGFb1-induced IL-10
Although TGFb1-induced IL-10 may have an autocrine
stimulatory effect on melanoma cells by increasing their
proliferation (24), it may also behave as a suppressor factor,

mainly for antigen-presenting cells. We thus measured the
effect that the addition of TGFb1 to tumor cells had on the
activation of DCs, a cell population that links innate and
adaptive immunity and activates antitumor immunity. An
inhibition on LPS-induced TNFa and IL-12 production was
observed after pretreatment of DCs with MCM, which was
stronger when using TGFb1-MCM, as compared with culture
medium (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect of TGFb1-MCM was
restored by anti-IL-10 blocking antibodies, confirming
the important role of IL-10 as a suppressive factor in
TGFb1-MCM.

Similarly, TGFb1-MCM induced upregulation of immunosuppressive molecules such as enzymes COX-2 and IDO
(indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase) and the membrane molecule
PD-L1 (Fig. 3B). In this case, upregulation of COX2 and PD-L1
was dependent on IL-10 whereas IDO expression depended on
other TGFb1-induced unknown factors.
We finally studied the ability of these DCs to activate T
lymphocytes. Although DCs treated with MCM, with or without TGFb1, had a lower capacity to induce allogeneic T-cell
proliferation, a higher inhibition in IFNg production was
observed when using DCs treated with TGFb1-MCM

(Fig. 3C), in agreement with the lowest levels of IL-12 produced by these DCs.
In vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of the TGF-b1
inhibitor peptide P144
Because TGFb1 plays an important role in the induction of
factors relevant for melanoma progression, we analyzed the in
vitro and in vivo effects of the TGFb1 inhibitor peptide P144
(17). In vitro analysis of the classical TGFb1 signaling pathway
showed that phosphorylation of Smad3 in A375 cells was
decreased after treatment with P144 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly,
TGFb1-induced MCP-1 and IL-10 production in A375 cell
cultures was specifically inhibited by this peptide (Fig. 4B).
Because of the inhibitory effects that P144 had on A375 cells
in vitro, we tested this peptide in in vivo tumor models. We first
implanted A375 cells subcutaneously in athymic mice, and
when tumor diameter reached 5 mm, animals were given P144
injections daily for 3 weeks. TGFb1 is detected both in the
serum of these animals and in tumor homogenates, suggesting
that this cytokine could be relevant in this in vivo model and
susceptible to be considered a target. A significant delay in

tumor growth and enhanced survival was observed in those
mice treated with P144 (Fig. 5A). They also had a lower
number of tumor-infiltrating macrophages, associated with
lower MCP-1 levels (Fig. 5B). A similar decrease in MCP-1
levels was also observed in the serum (Supplementary

VEGF levels (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and inhibited tumor
angiogenesis, measured as a hemoglobin content (Fig. 5C) or

Induction of MCP-1 and IL-10 by TGFb1 in Melanoma

The immunosuppressive effect of TGFb1 was studied in
immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-OVA melanoma tumors, in which the production of TGFb1 (25) and
IL-10 (26) has been reported. Although treatment of tumorbearing mice with OVA antigen plus adjuvants poly(I:C) and
anti-CD40 delayed tumor growth, combination of this treatment with P144 promoted a higher tumor growth inhibition
(Fig. 6A). This decreased tumor growth was associated with
lower intratumor IL-10 (Fig. 6B). The analysis of innate
immunity in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice showed that
P144 enhanced the proportion of activated CD86þ DCs
induced by immunotherapy, as well as the activity, measured
as IFNg production, of NK cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Moreover, splenic T cells from P144-treated mice produced
higher IFNg levels after stimulation with the CD8þ epitope

OVA(257–264) (Fig. 6C). This enhanced activation of innate
and adaptive immunity resulted in higher intratumor levels of
IFNg (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
In the present study, we showed that TGFb1 enhances the
production of MCP-1 and IL-10 by A375 melanoma cells, two
factors associated with the progression of this malignancy
(27). It has been described that MCP-1 increases tumorassociated monocyte/macrophages, leading to a higher degree
of angiogenesis (28). Moreover, IL-10 has been detected as
elevated levels in sera from patients with melanoma and is
associated with a shorter survival rate in advanced melanoma
patients (16). However, to our knowledge, the present work is
the first to report the induction of MCP-1 and IL-10 by TGFb1
in melanoma cells. Preliminary experiments, carried out using
primary tumor lines obtained from patients with metastatic
melanoma, have also shown an increase in MCP-1 induction
by TGFb1 (E. Feijoo, unpublished results), which confirms the
clinical relevance of this finding.
Cross-talk between different signaling pathways has been
described to explain the effect of TGFb1 on different factors
related to cancer progression. Besides the TGFb1-Smad pathway, several groups have also observed the TGFb1-mediated
activation of Smad-independent pathways (29–31). We have
determined that TGFb1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation is
responsible for the MCP-1 increase and IL-10 induction in
A375 cells. Because IL-10 is induced by TGFb1 and it has been
previously described that MAP/ERK signaling pathway was
implicated in the expression of IL-10 mRNA in A375 cells (32),
we hypothesized that this signaling pathway could interact
with the Smad3 signaling pathway induced by TGFb1. We
have shown that the MAP/ERK1/2 pathway, which is constitutively activated in this melanoma cell line due to the
BRAFV600E mutation, a mutation detected in 66% of melanomas (33), is not activated by TGFb1. However, using specific
inhibitors, we found that both Smad3 and MAP/ERK1/2 pathways were essential for the expression of IL-10. We have also
found that A375 cells show constitutive expression of IL-8, a
factor dependent on the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway but independent on TGFb1 (data not shown). Because PI3K/AKT
signaling supports the survival of melanoma cells (34) and
has been implicated in the progression of human melanoma
(35), we tested the role of this pathway in the production of
MCP-1 and IL-10. Even though TGFb1 has no effect on the
phosphorylation of AKT, by using a specific inhibitor of PI3K,
we observed that MCP-1 production by A375 cells is triggered
by this signaling pathway as well as by the Smad3 and MAPK/
ERK signaling pathways. These results suggest the existence of
a downstream cross-talk between Smad3, PI3K/AKT, and
MAP/ERK1/2 signaling pathways in the expression of MCP1 and IL-10 in A375 melanoma cells.
Besides the direct effects of TGFb1 on tumor cells,
our studies show new indirect mechanisms induced by TGFb1
that facilitate melanoma progression. Indeed, TGFb1-dependent upregulation of MCP-1 resulted in a higher attraction of
monocytes, which have been conditioned by tumor cells to

produce proangiogenic factors VEGF and bFGF, suggesting
that TGFb1 may promote mechanisms that not only favor
monocyte infiltration but also condition these cells toward a
phenotype that facilitates melanoma progression. There are a
number of publications indicating the relevant role of macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 in tumor progression (36,
37). According to this, our results support that monocytes
could enhance tumor growth directly by the production of
growth factors such as bFGF (38) and VEGF (39), and, indirectly, by their proangiogenic effect (13). This possibility seems
to be in agreement with a previous work showing that MCP-1
blockage prevented angiogenesis and tumor growth in human
malignant melanoma (40). Moreover, the induction of TGFb1
mRNA in monocytes cultured with A375 melanoma conditioned medium might suggest that tumor-infiltrating monocytes could be a source of this cytokine in patients with
melanoma. As it has been described in this work, this TGFb
production may constitute a positive loop that further
enhances tumor progression.
Consistent with the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10, we
have shown that TGFb1-MCM induced an IL-10–dependent
functional impairment of dendritic cells, characterized by a
lower production of proinflammatory factors TNFa and IL-12
and the upregulation of immunoregulatory molecules PDL-1
and COX-2. Moreover, we have also observed that TGFb1MCM induced other suppressive factors such as IDO in DCs,
which may cause their impairment, although in this case, it
was independent of the production of IL-10. As a result, a
decreased ability to activate IFNg-producing T lymphocytes
was observed in DCs cultured with TGFb1-MCM. Thus, these
results show that in melanoma, TGFb1 not only acts on DCs
through the already described direct immunosuppressive
mechanism (5) but also through indirect pathways mediated
by IL-10 and other unknown factors which will enhance the
final negative effect on this important cell population.
The multifaceted effect of TGFb1 on tumor progression
suggests that inhibition of this cytokine should be considered
when planning therapeutic strategies in melanoma patients.
Indeed, we have reported that inhibition of this cytokine in
combination with immunotherapy had some beneficial effects

in a murine melanoma model (41). Because we found several
mechanisms induced by TGFb1 on A375 cells favoring tumor
progression, we tested the effect of the TGFb1 inhibitor
peptide P144. In vitro assays showed that P144 inhibited
TGFb1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and MCP-1 and IL10 expression in A375 cells cultures. More important, in vivo
administration of P144 in two melanoma models significantly
delayed tumor growth. In athymic mice bearing A375 tumors,
P144 treatment decreased macrophage infiltrate, intratumor
MCP-1, and VEGF production as well as tumor angiogenesis,
reinforcing the role of TGFb1 and MCP-1 on this tumor
growth mechanism. Moreover, in immunocompetent mice,
P144 downregulated intratumor IL-10 expression, associated
with stronger innate and adaptive immunity. These data show
new roles of TGFb1 in the progression of melanoma, such as
those responsible for the induction of MCP-1 and IL-10. They
suggest that its inhibition in combination with other therapies
could be indicated in patients with metastatic melanoma
in accordance with recently published data showing that
inhibition of TGFb1 enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy
(42–44).
