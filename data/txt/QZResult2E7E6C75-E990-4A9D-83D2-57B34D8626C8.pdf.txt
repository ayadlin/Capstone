Abstract
STAT3 offers an attractive target for cancer therapy, but smallmolecule inhibitors with appealing pharmacologic properties
have been elusive. Here, we report hydroxamic acid–based and
benzoic acid–based inhibitors (SH5-07 and SH4-54, respectively)
with robust bioactivity. Both inhibitors blocked STAT3 DNAbinding activity in vitro and in human glioma, breast, and prostate
cancer cells and in v-Src–transformed murine ﬁbroblasts. STAT3dependent gene transcription was blocked along with Bcl-2, BclxL, Mcl-1, cyclin D1, c-Myc, and survivin expression. Nuclear
magnetic resonance analysis of STAT3-inhibitor complexes
deﬁned interactions with the SH2 and DNA-binding domains of
STAT3. Ectopic expression of the SH2 domain in cells was sufﬁ-

Introduction
The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
proteins mediate cytokine and growth factor responses, including
promoting cell growth and differentiation, and immune
responses (1, 2). Ligand binding to the receptor promotes STAT
activation by inducing the critical tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation
by growth factor receptor Tyr kinases, JAKs or Src. Phosphorylation in turn drives STAT:STAT dimerization through a reciprocal
phospho-Tyr-Src Homology (SH)2 domain interaction. STAT:
STAT dimers translocate to the nucleus and bind speciﬁc DNAresponse elements in target gene promoters to mediate transcription, thereby regulating fundamental cellular processes.
Aberrant activation of STAT3, however, occurs in malignant
transformation and is implicated in glioma, breast, prostate, ovarian, and many other cancers (3–5). Mechanisms to induce tumorigenesis and tumor progression include dysregulation of gene

cient to counter the STAT3-inhibitory effects of SH4-54. Neither
compound appreciably affected STAT1 or STAT5 DNA-binding
activities, STAT3-independent gene transcription, or activation of
a panel of oncogenic kinases in malignant cells. Each compound
decreased the proliferation and viability of glioma, breast, and
prostate cancer cells and v-Src–transformed murine ﬁbroblasts
harboring constitutively active STAT3. Further, in mouse xenograft models of glioma and breast cancer, administration of
SH5-07 or SH4-54 effectively inhibited tumor growth. Our
results offer preclinical proof of concept for SH5-07 and SH454 as candidates for further development as cancer therapeutics.

expression that leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor
cells, enhanced tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis (1, 3, 6–
8). STAT3 activity further represses tumor immune surveillance
(5, 9). Moreover, STAT3 cross-talks with NF-kB (10) and regulates
mitochondrial functions to drive malignant transformation in
speciﬁc contexts (11). The STAT3 signaling pathway is considered
an attractive target for the discovery of novel anticancer drugs.
On-going discovery campaigns for novel therapeutic modulators of STAT3 signaling (5, 12–19) have largely focused on
targeting the critical dimerization step to develop STAT3 inhibitors (5, 12, 13, 15, 19–23). The STAT3 dimerization inhibitor, BP1-102, emerged as an important lead compound that induced
antitumor cell effects in vitro at 10 to 20 mmol/L and antitumor
effects in preclinical models of breast and non–small cell lung
cancers (15). Toward further improving the potency of the salicylic acid, BP-1-102 (15), we have synthesized and evaluated
the hydroxamic acid, SH5-07, and benzoic acid, SH4-54, analogues, which show improved in vitro inhibitory activities at 1 to
8 mmol/L. Structural data suggest that these agents interact with
the STAT3 SH2 and DNA-binding domains (DBD). Further, both
agents inhibit in vivo growth of human glioma and breast cancer
xenografts that harbor aberrantly active STAT3.

epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (NIH3T3/hEGFR), and
the human breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), pancreatic (Panc1), and prostate (DU145) cancer cells have all been reported
(15, 21, 24–27). STAT3-null mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast line
(MEF/ST3KO) and ovarian cancer cells (A2780S) were kind gifts
of Drs. Valeria Poli (University of Turin, Italy) and Jin Cheng
(Mofﬁtt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL), respectively. The human
glioma lines, U251MG, U373MG, U87MG (Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation), and SF-295 (Division of Cancer Treatment and
Diagnosis Tumor Repository of the National Cancer Institute,
Frederick, MD), were obtained from the designated sources and
cultured in RPMI medium-1640 supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (Corning Inc.) and containing 10% heatinactivated FBS. All other cells were grown in DMEM plus 10%
heat-inactivated FBS. Except where designated, all antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies.
Plasmids and molecular cloning
The STAT3-dependent luciferase reporter, pLucTKS3, and the
STAT3-independent reporter, pLucSRE, have been previously
reported (28, 29). The pLucTKS3 reporter contains seven copies
of the STAT3-speciﬁc binding sequence in the C-reactive protein
gene promoter driving ﬁreﬂy luciferase expression, whereas the
STAT3-independent, pLucSRE reporter is driven by the serum
response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter. More details of
the reporters and the STAT3 SH2 and DBD constructs are provided
in Supplementary Materials.
Transient transfection of expression vectors and luciferase
reporter plasmids and reporter assay
Transient transfection using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) and luciferase assays were performed as previously
reported (28, 29). Details are provided in Supplementary
Materials.
siRNA transfection using Dharmacon SMARTpool
The ON-TARGETplus human STAT3 siRNA SMARTpool
(L-003544) and the control (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting
Pool, D-001810-10-20) were both purchased from GE Dharmacon Inc. Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA (25 nmol/L)
using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
STAT3 and its downstream genes were assayed in a pool of cells by
Western blotting, and another pool of transfected cells was
cultured in 96-well plates for additional 72 hours and subjected
to CyQUANT cell proliferation assay (Life Technologies).
Nuclear extract preparation and gel shift assays
Nuclear extract preparation and DNA-binding/electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed as previously
described (24, 29). Details are provided in Supplementary
Materials.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
Studies were performed as previously reported (14, 15). Puriﬁed STAT3 (50 mg/mL) was injected onto the HisCap Sensor Chip
for immobilization. Various concentrations of agents in running
buffer (1 PBS; 0.5% DMSO) were passed over the chip to
produce response signals. The association and dissociation rate
constants were calculated using the Qdat software. The ratio of the

www.aacrjournals.org

association and dissociation rate constants was determined as the
binding afﬁnity (KD).
Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of STAT3–compound
interactions
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies were performed
using the human STAT3b protein encompassing residues 127–
711 in solution with agents and are described in detail in Supplementary Materials. Resonance assignments of STAT3 is
described elsewhere (Namanja et al., manuscript submitted).
Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting
analysis
These studies were performed as previously described (29, 30).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR studies
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed
as previously reported (31), with minor modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy,
1  107 cells in culture were treated with 5 or 8 mmol/L SH4-54 for
3 hours and ﬁxed with 1% formaldehyde for 7 minutes at room
temperature. Cells were then treated with glycine (0.125 mol/L,
5 minutes) at room temperature for cross-linking, washed with
ice-cold PBS, and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride) and centrifuged.
Nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors;
Roche) for lysis. To shear the DNA, the nuclear lysates were
sonicated (Omni International) at 30% power for 3 pulses for
10-second intervals on ice. Samples were precleared with protein
A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at 4 C,
with rocking and incubated with anti-STAT3 (C20X) or antiSTAT5 (C-17) antibodies or with normal rabbit IgG at 4 C
overnight, with rocking for immunoprecipitation. Immunecomplexes were collected with 20 mL protein A/G agarose bead,
washed multiple times with wash buffer A (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton
X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and two
times with wash buffer B (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 500 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and
eluted with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mmol/L
NaHCO3). Cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 C in the
presence of NaCl followed by proteinase K treatment (20 mL, 20
mg/mL; Pierce) overnight. The DNA was recovered and puriﬁed
using ChIP spin columns (Zymo Research Corp). The puriﬁed
chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA was used as a template for
PCR ampliﬁcation of the promoters for inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), survivin, Bcl-2, and b-casein genes. The PCR
products were resolved on 2% agarose gel. ChIP results were
analyzed by triplicate qPCR of the immunoprecipitated samples
and corresponding 1% input samples using primers ﬂanking the
STAT3-binding region of each indicated gene promoter. Quantiﬁcation was performed using the DCt method, appropriate due to
the >90% PCR efﬁciency of each primer set. The percent input
enrichment was determined by normalizing the Ct value for each
sample to its corresponding 1% input Ct value. These absolute
values were plotted as in the ﬁgures. Details and the PCR oligonucleotide primers are described in Supplementary Materials.
Cell viability assays
CyQUANT cell proliferation assay to evaluate compounds
was performed, as previously reported (14, 15) and following

Soft-agar colony formation and clonogenic survival assays
These studies were performed as previously reported
(15, 28, 29). Details are provided in Supplementary Materials.
Cell-cycle proﬁle and Annexin V binding with ﬂow cytometry
analyses
Cells were treated with 0 to 8 mmol/L agent for 24 to 48
hours. For cell-cycle proﬁle analysis, cells were harvested and
ﬁxed with 70% ice-cold ethanol and stained with propidium
iodide (PI). For apoptosis analysis, cells were collected and
stained with FITC–Annexin V using the Apoptosis Detection Kit
(BD Biosciences). Both the DNA content of cells and the
Annexin V–positive cells were analyzed by FACScan ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell-cycle phase distribution was
analyzed using the Cell-Fit program. Data acquisition was gated
to exclude cell doublets.
Wound-healing assay for migration
Studies were performed as previously reported (15). Details are
provided in Supplementary Materials.
Mice and in vivo tumor studies
All animal experiments were performed under a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Four- to ﬁve-week-old female athymic nude mice were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in the institutional
animal facilities approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Mice were injected s.c.
in the left ﬂank area with U251MG cells (1  107) in 200 mL

of PBS/Matrigel matrix (1:1; BD Biosciences), or MDA-MB-231
cells (5  106) in 100 mL of PBS. Mice with tumors of 90 to 150
mm3 (MDA-MB-231) or 150 mm3 (U251MG) were grouped for
identical mean tumor sizes, administered 3, 5, or 6 mg/kg SH5-07
or SH4-54 via oral gavage daily or tail vein injection every 2 or 3
days, and monitored every 3 to 7 days. Tumor sizes were measured
with calipers and converted to tumor volume, V, as follows: V ¼
0.52  a2  b, where a is the smallest superﬁcial diameter and b is
the largest superﬁcial diameter. For each treatment group, the
tumor volumes for each set of measurements were statistically
analyzed relative to the control (1% DMSO-treated) group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed on mean values using Prism
GraphPad Software, Inc. The signiﬁcance of differences between
groups was determined by the paired t test at  , P < 0.05;  , P <
0.01; and  , P < 0.001.

Results
Compounds preferentially inhibit STAT3:STAT3 DNA-binding
activity
SH4-54 and SH5-07 (Fig. 1A) are benzoic and hydroxamic acid
analogues (32), respectively, of BP-1-102 (15). Preincubation of
NIH3T3/v-Src nuclear extracts of equal total protein containing
constitutively-active STAT3 with 0 to 10 mmol/L SH5-07 or SH4-54
for 30 minutes at room temperature, prior to incubation with the
radiolabeled high-afﬁnity sis-inducible element (hSIE) probe that
binds STAT3 and STAT1 and subjecting to EMSA analysis (12,
13, 15) dose-dependently inhibited STAT3 activity (Fig. 1B), with
the IC50 of 3.9  0.6 mmol/L and 4.7  0.5 mmol/L, respectively.
These potencies are improved over that of BP-1-102 (IC50 ¼ 6.8

Inhibition of intracellular STAT3 activation
EMSA analysis (14, 15) of nuclear extracts from human glioma
(U251MG, U373MG, U87MG, and SF295), breast (MDA-MB231), and prostate cancer (DU145) cells, or NIH3T3/v-Src cells
(4, 5, 8) and treated with 0 to 10 mmol/L SH5-07 or SH4-54 for
1 hour (Fig. 2A and B) shows inhibition of constitutively active
STAT3 in the U251MG and U87MG cells at 1 mmol/L and higher,
U373MG and SF295 lines at 1 to 3 mmol/L and higher, and in
MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells at 3 to 5 mmol/L and higher (Fig. 2A
and B). These compare more favorably over the potencies of
BP-1-102 of 10 to 20 mmol/L (15). Immunoblots conﬁrmed
pY705STAT3 reduction by agents at 3 to 10 mmol/L (Fig. 2C and
D), compared with 10 to 20 mmol/L activity for BP-1-102 (15).
Inhibition of STAT3 DNA-binding activity (Fig. 2B) or pY705STAT3
(Fig. 2D) occurs early (0.5–1 hour) and is sustained for 3 to 6 hours,
followed by an apparent weakening at 6 hours or later. By contrast,
BP-1-102 inhibited pY705STAT3 at 15 mmol/L and 24 hours, with
little effect at 1 hour (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Assuming the possibility of diminishing intracellular inhibitor levels, a time-course
study for the effects of 5 mmol/L SH5-07 with or without a second
treatment at time 5 hours after the ﬁrst treatment for additional
1 hour (6#) and 4 hour (9#) showed a sustained pY705STAT3
inhibition for up to 9 hours (Fig. 2E, lanes 5 and 6). Both inhibitors
had little effect on pS727-STAT3 (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
The observation that intracellular constitutive STAT3 DNAbinding activity decreased (Fig. 2A) with no corresponding change
in pY705STAT3 at 1 to 3 mmol/L, except at higher, 5 to 10 mmol/L
(Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2C), suggests that inhibition is
strongest on STAT3 DNA-binding activity, compared with
pY705STAT3 (Fig. 2A vs. C; Supplementary Fig. S2C). This apparent lack of correlation within the context of constitutively active
STAT3 suggests the disruption of the pre-existing STAT3:STAT3
dimers, which directly leads to lower DNA-binding activity (Fig.
1B; refs. 12–15, 33), has a nonlinear relationship with the turnover
of the disrupted pSTAT3 molecules. This likely reﬂects differences
in kinetics and highlights the complexity of the events involved in
the STAT3 activation and inactivation. We observe a similar nonagreement between the pSTAT3 and STAT3 DNA-binding activity
changes caused by the overexpression of 1 mg exogenous STAT3
SH2 domain, which suppressed DNA-binding activity, with no
corresponding pSTAT3 change (Supplementary Fig. S2D, lane 4).
The overexpression of higher, 2 or 4 mg, STAT3 SH2 domain,
however, caused concurrent reductions in both pSTAT3 and STAT3
DNA-binding activities (Supplementary Fig. S2D, lanes 5 and 6),
consistent with previous report that a peptide derived from the
SH2 domain inhibited STAT3 signaling (34) and that the SH2
domain expressed alone is functional. Moreover, dimerization
disruptors could inhibit DNA-binding activity and function, without necessarily inhibiting pY705STAT3. Nuclear extracts containing constitutively active STAT3 and preincubated with 5 mmol/L
SH4-54, SH5-07, or BP-1-102 (15) had lower STAT3 activity in the
cell-free EMSA analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2E, i), whereas the
corresponding pY705STAT3 immunoblots were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S2E.ii), presumably due to the absence of intracellular events to promote pY705STAT3 turnover. Therefore,
despite being a direct measure of the effects of dimerization
disruptors on STAT3 activation, DNA-binding activity inhibition
may not necessarily correlate with the pY705STAT3 inhibition.

656 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

Altogether, these data highlight complexities in the intracellular
STAT3 signaling induction and turnover that impact the measured
activities of dimerization disruptors or SH2 domain antagonists.
Luciferase reporter studies showed v-Src induces STAT3-dependent pLucTKS3 luciferase reporter activity (20, 21, 29) by 25- to 34fold, which was suppressed by 3 to 8 mmol/L SH5-07 (Fig. 2F, i,

Hydroxamic Acid and Benzoic Acid–Based STAT3 Inhibitors

not inhibit v-Src–induced, STAT3-independent pLucSRE reporter
activity (Fig. 2F, ii; refs. 20, 21, 28, 29). Agents had no signiﬁcant
effects on pY1068EGFR, pY416Src, pJAK2, pShc, pErk1/2MAPK, and
pS473Akt levels (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3D) at concentrations
that inhibit STAT3 activity (Fig. 2A–F). We note the agreement
between the inhibitory potencies in both the cell-free STAT3 DNAbinding assay (IC50, 3.9–4.7 mmol/L; Fig. 1B) and the intracellular
constitutively-active STAT3 studies (1–8 mmol/L; Fig. 2A–F). These
potencies are an improvement over the 10 to 20 mmol/L activities
for BP-1-102 (Supplementary Fig. S2A; ref. 15).
Agents bind STAT3, disrupt STAT3 association with growth
factor receptor, and thereby inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation
STAT3 dimerization disruptors suppress pY705STAT3 (13–16,
20, 21, 35–37). STATs are recruited to the receptor phospho-Tyr
motif for close proximity to Tyr kinases. We focused on STAT3
recruitment and assessed the effect of agents on EGFR:STAT3
association. In coimmunoprecipitation studies, EGF stimulation
of NIH3T3/hEGFR ﬁbroblasts induced 1.38-fold increase in
STAT3:EGFR complexation (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 vs. 2, STAT3), which
was associated with pY705STAT3 induction (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 vs. 1,
pY705STAT3). Twenty-four hour prior treatment of ﬁbroblasts
with agents decreased EGF-stimulated STAT3:EGFR coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5 vs. 3, STAT3), in parallel with
decreased EGF-induced pY705STAT3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4 vs. 2,
pY705STAT3), without inhibiting pY1068EGFR or pERK1/2
induction (Fig. 3C). Moreover, prior SH5-07 treatment of ﬁbroblasts had little effect on EGF-stimulated pY1068EGFR induction,
or pY705STAT3, except at 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S4). By
contrast, 1-hour prior treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with agents
inhibited pre-existing and/or IL6-stimulated pY705STAT3 induction (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 vs. 2 and 1, and lanes 5 vs. 6). We note the
differences in the time-to-inhibition between the EGF-stimulated
pY705STAT3 in mouse ﬁbroblasts, IL6-stimulated pY705STAT3 in
human breast cancer cells, and pre-existing pY705STAT3 in tumor
cells, which altogether indicate signal-type (constitutive, EGF- or
IL6-stimulated) and cell-type (normal mouse ﬁbroblasts vs.
human tumor cells) contexts of pY705STAT3 suppression. Therefore, agents inhibit ligand-stimulated de novo STAT3 induction.
Furthermore, disruption of STAT3:receptor interaction represents
one of the pY705STAT3 inhibition mechanisms.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of STAT3:agent
interactions shows SH4-54 and SH5-07 bound STAT3, with
afﬁnities (KD) of 2.4 mmol/L (Fig. 4A and data not shown). We
performed NMR analysis of STAT3:compound interactions. 1D
1
H NMR spectra of 200 mmol/L compounds (from DMSO stock)
in aqueous solution suggested 20 mmol/L effective concentration
(Supplementary Fig. S5A, data not shown), suggesting STAT3
could not be fully saturated by the compounds in NMR studies.
Given STAT3 protein concentration of 20 mmol/L and the 20
mmol/L maximal compound detected, the sample reached
approximately 1:1 stoichiometry. The percent saturation, based
on KD of 2.4 mmol/L, is approximately 70%. Solubility issues
prevented BP-1-102 analysis in a similar study. NMR chemical
shift perturbation (CSP) indicates that compounds interact with
STAT3 in a speciﬁc manner. The overlay of the 13C-1H HMQC
spectra of STAT3, free and in complex with the representative
compound, SH4-54, is shown (Fig. 4B, left). All 35 peaks from Ile
residues of STAT3 have been assigned (A.T. Namanja; unpublished data), providing probes for every structured domain. In
addition, site-directed mutations have been made to replace Leu

www.aacrjournals.org

residues in the DBD, one at a time, in order to identify their
resonances. Binding of compounds caused selective changes in
line widths at Ile residues 597, 386, and 439 and CSP of Leu411
(Fig. 4B, left). The line broadening effects observed by the Ile
signals indicate that the compounds bind to both the STAT3 SH2
and DBDs (Fig. 4B, left). Residues Leu411, Ile386, and Ile439
form a hydrophobic pocket that is likely involved in compound
binding. The peak from I364, which is next to the other perturbed
residues in the DBD, also showed CSP. The ribbon representation
of STAT3 structure in complex with DNA and with the locations of
these residues is shown (Fig. 4B, right).
NMR data identify a novel putative binding to the DBD. We
probed the speciﬁcity of the STAT3:compound interaction and the
signiﬁcance of the DBD. The most likely nonspeciﬁc event that
induces CSP is the alkylation of the Cys residues that do not form
disulﬁde bonds in the DBD, one of which is at the DB interface.
NMR analyses of 20 mmol/L STAT3 sample with and without 100
mmol/L NEM (Supplementary Fig. S5B) showed that the CSP due
to alkylation is different from that due to interaction with compounds. The CSP at residues I364 and L411 upon compound
interaction did not occur upon alkylation by NEM, suggesting the
STAT3:compound interaction is speciﬁc. Unfortunately, the poor
solubility and moderately weaker activity of BP-1-102 prevented
the collection of nuclear Overhauser effect data for detailed structural analysis. Moreover, EMSA analysis shows transiently expressed exogenous STAT3 SH2 domain rescued STAT3 activity
from compound effects, compared with the moderate rescue by
the DBD (Fig. 4C), indicating that the expressed SH2 domain is
functional (Supplementary Fig. S2D) and represents the primary
target site for the compounds, whereas the DBD interaction only
moderately contributes to the overall compound effect against
STAT3. We note that the expressed SH2 domain functions as a
negative regulator of STAT3 signaling (Supplementary Fig. S2D,
lanes 4–6). However, the exogenously expressed STAT3 SH2
domain, when concurrently present, binds compound, consistent
with the previous report that the SH2 domain and its peptide, SPI,
both sufﬁciently interacted with the dimerization disruptor, S3I201, and other STAT3 SH2 domain-binding peptides (34). The
easier accessibility to the exogenously expressed SH2 domain
favors interaction with the compound more than the occluded
SH2 domain in the STAT3:STAT3 dimer.
Compounds induce antitumor cell effects against malignant
cells harboring constitutively active STAT3
In agreement with STAT30 s role in tumor cell phenotype (3–
5, 14, 15), 72-hour treatment with the compounds of cultured
tumor cells harboring variable STAT3 activities (Supplementary
Fig. S6) inhibited viability to different degrees (Fig. 5A), with IC50
of 1.0 to 2.7 mmol/L for glioma U251MG and U87MG cells (Fig.
5A, middle plots), which are most sensitive. Other IC50 values are
3.8 to 4.5 mmol/L for breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 (231) cells (Fig.
5A, left plots), 3.8 to 7.4 mmol/L for glioma, U373MG and SF295
cells (Fig. 5A, middle plots), 5.3 to 5.8 mmol/L for DU145 prostate
cancer cells (Fig. 5A, left plots), 4.1 to 9.2 mmol/L for NIH3T3/vSrc (vSrc) (Fig. 5A, left plots), and 9.6 to 10.3 mmol/L for the least
sensitive human pancreatic cancer, Panc-1 cells (Fig. 5A, left
plots). The variable growth inhibition likely reﬂects the STAT3
activation levels that show different inhibitor sensitivities
(Fig. 2A–D) across the tumor cells. The 1.0 to 7.4 mmol/L range
that inhibits cell viability overlaps with the 1 to 5 mmol/L range
that inhibits STAT3 DNA-binding activity in tumor cells.

overexpression only moderately rescued cells (Fig. 5B, i, DBD),
consistent with the ﬁndings in Fig. 4C that the SH2 domain
represents the major target site for the inhibitors, and with the
previous report that the STAT3 SH2 domain rescued tumor cells
from BP-1-102–induced apoptosis (15). Furthermore, siRNA
knockdown of STAT3 suppressed U251MG viability (Fig. 5C).
In colony survival assay, one-time treatment with compounds
at 1 to 3 mmol/L dose-dependently suppressed U251MG and
MDA-MB-231 colony formation (Fig. 5D, left two plots), with
higher activity against U251MG cells, while minimally affecting

Comparatively, the viability of MCF-7, A2780S, normal NIH3T3

that do not harbor aberrantly active STAT3 (Supplementary Fig. S6)
is only moderately inhibited, with IC50 values of 8.1 to 10.8 mmol/L
or higher (Fig. 5A, right plot). We note the general trend that glioma
and breast cancer cells harboring aberrantly active STAT3 are more
sensitive.
To validate the STAT3 dependency, the transient overexpression of the SH2 domain (Fig. 5B, i) rescued MDA-MB-231 cells
from the effects of SH4-54 (Fig. 5B, i, SH2), whereas the DBD

MEF/ST3KO (Fig. 5D, right plot). SH5-07 further dose-dependently suppressed the soft-agar growth of U251MG and MDAMB-231 cells, with a higher activity against MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Flow cytometry/cell-cycle proﬁle analysis shows sub-G0 phase
population increased by 15% to 55% for MDA-MB-231 cells
treated with 5 to 8 mmol/L SH5-07 for 24 to 48 hours, with
decreased cell numbers in G1, S, and G2–M phases (Fig. 5F, i),
and 20% for U251MG cells treated with 8 mmol/L SH5-07 for 48
hours, associated with reduced G0–G1 phase population (Fig. 5F, ii,
8 mmol/L), while treatment had minimal effects on MEF/ST3KO
(Fig. 5F, iii). Annexin V binding/ﬂow cytometry analysis showed
5.8% and 18% apoptosis, respectively, for U251MG and MDA-MB-

231 cells treated with 8 mmol/L SH5-07 for 24 hours (Fig. 5G, i and
ii) and minimal effects on similarly treated MEF/ST3KO cells
(Fig. 5G, iii). Therefore, cell-cycle changes and apoptosis contribute
to the growth inhibition of tumor cells that harbor persistently
active STAT3. Further, 8 mmol/L SH5-07 or SH4-54 treatment for
22 hours suppressed MDA-MB-231, U251MG, and DU145 cells
migration into the denuded area (Supplementary Fig. S7B, i and
S7B, ii, top plots), without affecting cell viability (Supplementary

5 mmol/L SH5-07 treatment (Fig. 6A). ChiP analysis with qPCR
conﬁrmed decreased promoter occupancy by STAT3 of the iNOS,
bcl-2, and survivin genes in cells treated for 3 hours with 5 or 8
mmol/L SH4-54, and not STAT5 occupancy of b-casein gene
promoter (Fig. 6B). siRNA knockdown of STAT3 suppressed
iNOS, Bcl-2, and survivin expression (Fig. 6C). Studies altogether
validate the inhibition of aberrantly active STAT3, suppression
of constitutive induction of STAT3-regulated genes (3–6, 8), and
the suppression of tumor phenotype by SH5-07 and SH4-54.
SH5-07 and SH4-54 inhibit growth of human breast and glioma
tumor xenografts
Tail vein injection (5–6 mg/kg every 2–3 days) or oral gavage
delivery (3 mg/kg daily) of SH5-07 or SH4-54 inhibited growth of
90 to 150 mm3 established subcutaneous mouse xenografts of
human glioma (U251MG; Fig. 7A) and breast (MDA-MB-231;
Fig. 7B) tumors that harbor aberrantly active STAT3, associated with
decreased c-Myc, Mcl-1, and cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 7C). No
signiﬁcant changes in body weights (Supplementary Fig. S8A), blood
cell counts (Supplementary Fig. S8B), or the gross anatomy of
organs (Supplementary Fig. S8C), or obvious signs of toxicity, such
as loss of appetite, decreased activity, or lethargy, were observed.

STAT3-inhibiting anticancer drugs (5). The hydroxamic acid,
SH5-07, and the benzoic acid, SH4-54 (32), analogues of BP-1102 (15) have emerged as potent and selective inhibitors, with
single-digit micromolar activities against STAT3 signaling.
Studies show that constitutively active STAT3 in tumors
responds variably across tumor lines to small-molecule inhibitors. The differential sensitivities of aberrantly active STAT3
signaling suggest complexities in the STAT3 induction and
decay mechanisms in tumor cells. Compared with other notable agents, including BP-1-102 (15) and S3I-1757 (19), both
SH5-07 and SH4-54 possess stronger activities.
Present studies, together with published reports (13–15, 17, 19,
23, 37), demonstrate the biologic responsiveness to small-molecule
STAT3 inhibitors of tumor models harboring persistently active
STAT3, including glioma, breast, prostate, and lung cancer models.
Interestingly, among the STAT3-relevant tumor models, the human
glioma tumor cells, U251MG and U87MG, appear to be more
sensitive than the glioma lines, U373MG and SF295 or the breast
cancer line, MDA-MB-231, prostate cancer cells, DU145, or the vSrc-transformed mouse ﬁbroblasts, whereas Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells are least responsive. Given the importance of constitutively
active STAT3 in promoting aggressive glioma phenotype and its
clinical relevance in predicting a poor clinical outcome, current
studies together with others (38–41) raise the potential that smallmolecule STAT3-inhibiting therapeutics, such as SH5-07 and SH454, could be particularly useful in antiglioma therapy.

Yue et al.

Aberrantly active STAT3 dysregulates expression of critical genes
that control tumor cell growth and survival, tumor angiogenesis,
tumor cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis (15, 20, 21,
23, 25, 26, 42–45). The inhibition of STAT3 signaling by SH5-07
and SH4-54 is associated with decreased Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1,
c-Myc, Mcl-1, and survivin expression, and antitumor responses in
human glioma and breast cancer models. Against this compelling
evidence, however, studies by others showed that the phosphatasestable, cell-permeable SH2 domain–targeting prodrug inhibitor
of STAT3, PM-73G, did not inhibit cyclin D1, Bcl-2, or survivin
expression or induce apoptosis (36, 46) at the concentrations that
inhibited pY705STAT3 in tumor cells, except at 50-fold higher
concentration (36). The failure in those studies to observe antitumor cell response to agents at concentrations that inhibit
pY705STAT3 contrasts with the current study and others, and
likely suggests complex mechanisms and functions of constitutive
STAT3 activation in malignant progression that may differentially
impact the cellular responses to STAT3 inhibitors. It further indicates there is more to learn about the relationship between the
inhibition of STAT3 signaling by small molecules and the overall
biologic outcome. By comparison, the suppression of the known
STAT3-regulated genes and antitumor cell responses to SH5-07 or
SH4-54 occurred at 1 to 8 mmol/L concentrations that inhibit
constitutively active STAT3, measured by pY705STAT3, STAT3
DNA-binding activity, and STAT3-dependent luciferase reporter
transcription. The inhibitory responses are validated by the SH2
domain overexpression that countered the effects of the small
molecules and by the siRNA knockdown of STAT3 that produced
similar results.
Altogether, the present study identiﬁes SH5-07 and SH4-54 as
potent STAT3 inhibitors, which induce antitumor cell effects in
vitro and antitumor response in vivo against human glioma and
breast cancer models. The efﬁcacy studies against subcutaneous
xenografts are intended to provide proof-of-concept for the
potential efﬁcacy against glioma and breast cancers. SH5-07 and
SH4-54 are therefore potential candidates for further develop-

ment for clinical application, particularly for human glioma and
breast cancers.
