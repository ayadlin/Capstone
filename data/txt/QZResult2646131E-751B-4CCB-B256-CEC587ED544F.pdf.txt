Abstract
Endostatin, a proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII, is a
potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth. We
studied the development of carcinogen-induced skin tumors
in transgenic J4 mice overexpressing endostatin in their
keratinocytes. Unexpectedly, we did not observe any differences in tumor incidence and multiplicity between these and
control mice, nor in the rate of conversion of benign
papillomas to malignant squamous cell carcinomas (SCC).
We did find, however, that endostatin regulates the terminal
differentiation of keratinocytes because the SCCs in the J4
mice were less aggressive and more often well differentiated
than those in the control mice. We observed an inhibition of
tumor angiogenesis by endostatin at an early stage in skin
tumor development, but more strikingly, there was a
significant reduction in lymphatic vessels in the papillomas
and SCCs in association with elevated endostatin levels and
also a significant inhibition of lymph node metastasis in the J4
mice. We showed that tumor-infiltrating mast cells strongly
expressed vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), and
that the accumulation of these cells was markedly decreased
in the tumors of the J4 mice. Moreover, endostatin inhibited
the adhesion and migration of murine MC/9 mast cells on
fibronectin in vitro. Our data suggest that endostatin can
inhibit tumor lymphangiogenesis by decreasing the VEGF-C
levels in the tumors, apparently via inhibition of mast cell
migration and adhesion, and support the view that the
biological effects of endostatin are not restricted to endothelial cells because endostatin also regulates tumor-associated
inflammation and differentiation, and the phenotype of
epithelial tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11528–35]

Introduction
Endostatin, a proteolytic fragment of the vascular and epithelial
basement membrane collagen type XVIII, is an efficient antiangiogenic and antitumor molecule (1). Recombinant endostatin inhibits
the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and induces
their apoptosis, which leads to reduced tumor vascularization and
subsequently suppresses tumor growth in mice (reviewed in 2, 3).
Transgenic mice overexpressing endostatin specifically in their
endothelial cells show a 1.6-fold increase in circulating endostatin

levels, which is sufficient to inhibit tumor vascularization and slow
down the growth of transplanted tumors (4).
Diverse molecular mechanisms are associated with endostatin
signaling. Among other effects, endostatin can reduce endothelial
cell motility by interfering with basic fibroblast growth factor–
induced signal transduction (5), induce apoptosis of endothelial
cells (6), and block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)mediated signaling by directly interacting with the receptor
VEGFR-2 (7). The most consistent effect of endostatin is the
inhibition of growth factor–induced endothelial cell migration,
which is thought to occur by binding to integrin a5h1 (8), and
subsequent disruption of cell-matrix adhesion via caveolin-1/Src
tyrosine kinase/Rho (9, 10) or via FAK/Ras/Raf/extracellular signalregulated kinase1/p38 signaling pathways (11). Using genome-wide
expression profiling, Abdollahi and coworkers (12) showed that
endostatin affects the expression of up to 12% of the genes in
human endothelial cells, down-regulating the angiogenic stimulators, and up-regulating many antiangiogenic genes. Moreover, they
showed that endostatin affects signaling events that are not
directly associated with angiogenesis, demonstrating the importance of interpathway communications in a complex signaling
network.
We have recently reported on the generation and characterization of transgenic mice overproducing endostatin in the skin and in
the eye lens capsule under the keratin 14 promoter (J4 mice;
ref. 13). These mice develop cataract of the lens due to loosening of
the contact of the epithelial cells with the lens capsule and due to
abnormal proliferation and clustering of these cells. They also have
significantly broadened epidermal basement membranes, and a
similar phenotype has been observed in mice lacking collagen
XVIII (14), indicating that endostatin and its precursor have a
role in maintaining the structural integrity of the basement
membranes (13).
We have used the J4 mice to analyze the effects of elevated
endostatin levels on chemically induced skin tumors and tumor
vascularization. Most in vivo studies reporting the antiangiogenic
and antitumor effects of endostatin have been performed using
tumors implanted in mice and have involved substantial doses of
recombinant endostatin (reviewed in 2). To our knowledge, only
one previous study describes the antitumor effects of recombinant
endostatin administration on carcinogen-induced mammary
tumors in the rat (15). We used a multistage mouse skin carcinogenesis protocol involving 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene
(DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatments to induce tumor formation (16). This approach allowed us
to follow the consequences of continuous skin-specific endostatin
overexpression on tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression at
different stages in skin carcinogenesis. We present here in vivo and

in vitro evidence that endostatin regulates the infiltration of
VEGF-C–producing mast cells into the tumor tissue, which leads
to decreased lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis, and
that it also modulates the terminal differentiation of SCCs in the
mouse skin.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Age- and sex-matched J4 transgenic mice overexpressing endostatin in the epidermal basal cells (13) and wild-type control mice, both of a
FVB/N background, were used for the skin carcinogenesis studies.
Chemical skin carcinogenesis. Each experimental group consisted of
25 to 30 J4 and control mice aged for 12 weeks. Their dorsal skin was shaved
and tumors were induced by a single topical application of 100 Ag of DMBA
(Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 AL of acetone. After 1 week, tumor formation was
promoted by treating the mice weekly for 12 to 20 weeks with 5 Ag of
TPA (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 AL of acetone. Tumor growth was monitored as
follows: Group 1, DMBA initiation followed by TPA promotion for 12 weeks
and sacrifice at 13 weeks; Group 2, DMBA initiation followed by TPA
promotion for 20 weeks and sacrifice at 24 weeks; and Group 3, DMBA
initiation followed by TPA promotion for 20 weeks and sacrifice at
34 weeks. The number of tumors on each mouse was counted weekly for
the duration of the experiment, and tumor size was measured with a gauge.
The tumor incidence (percentage of mice with a tumor) and tumor
multiplicity (number of papillomas per mouse) were recorded. Mice were
sacrificed if moribund or if the tumor load was excessive. All the animal
experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Oulu and by the State Provincial Office of Oulu.
Tumor and tissue sample harvesting. Mice were sacrificed, the skin
tumors were removed, and a complete autopsy, including lymph node
dissection, was performed. The samples were evaluated by a pathologist in a
blinded manner on the basis of H&E-stained sections, and the skin
alterations were classified as representing hyperplasia, dysplasia, papilloma,
keratoacanthoma, well-, moderately, or poorly differentiated SCC or spindle
cell carcinoma. The autopsy samples were evaluated histopathologically for
the presence of metastases.
Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Tissue sections
were either treated with trypsin for 30 min at 37jC and stained with a rat
antimouse CD-31 antibody (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1;
BD Biosciences PharMingen), heated in a microwave oven in EDTA-Tris
buffer (pH 9,0) and stained with an antirabbit VEGF-C antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), or treated with 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 3.0) for 30
min at 37jC and stained with a rat antimouse monoclonal F4/80 antibody
against macrophages (Serotec). The tyramide signal amplification kit
(TSA; Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) was used according the manufacturer’s
instructions to intensify the color reactions. A biotinylated antirat or
antirabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody.
For Lyve-1 and VEGFR-3 immunostainings, sections were heated in a
microwave oven in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated with an
antimouse Lyve-1 antibody or with an antimouse VEGFR-3 antibody (17),
using the TSA signal amplification protocol. A biotinylated antirabbit or
antirabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories) was used for detection. Mast
cells were detected by Leder’s method of chloroacetate esterase histochemistry (18). The number of mast cells within the tumor and peritumoral
stroma was counted from ten random fields of 0.1 mm2, covering 1.0 mm2
area in total.
Determination of vessel density. The immunostained tumor sections
were analyzed at 100 magnification to identify the areas of high
vascularization, either in the tumor itself (blood vessels only) or in the
surrounding area (blood vessels and lymphatic vessels). Vessels were
counted in 10 fields (carcinomas) or 5 fields (papillomas) representing the
areas of highest vascular density at 200 magnification. Branching
structures were considered as a single vessel, and the average of the
microvessel counts was calculated.
Apoptosis assay. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP-biotin end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using an in situ cell
death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s

www.aacrjournals.org

instructions with some modifications. The paraformaldehyde-fixed sections
were incubated in 3% H2O2/methanol for 10 min at room temperature,
permeabilized with proteinase K for 10 min at 37jC, and incubated for 30
min at 37jC in the TUNEL reaction buffer containing the label solution and
the enzyme solution, both diluted 1:1 with TUNEL-diluting buffer. The
following steps were carried out as suggested except that the duration of the
incubation in 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine was reduced to 15 s. Five random fields
at 200 magnification were counted to determine the numbers of apoptotic
cells.
Proliferation assay. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the
sections for 10 min in a microwave oven in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
The sections were incubated overnight at 4jC with a monoclonal rat
antimouse Ki67 antibody (DAKOCytomation), and a Cy3-conjugated goat
antirat antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used
as a secondary antibody. Five random fields at 200 magnification were
counted to determine the numbers of proliferating cells in the sections.
Cell culture. The murine mast cell line MC/9 (a gift from Dr. Gunnar
Nilsson, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden) was maintained in RPMI
1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/mL
of recombinant mouse interleukin-3 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
4 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 50 Amol/L 2-mercaptoethanol.
Expression and purification of recombinant endostatin. The cloning
and the purification of recombinant human endostatin have been described
earlier (8).
Adhesion assay. 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4jC with
25 Ag/mL of fibronectin (BD Biosciences) in PBS or with 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS to determine the spontaneous adhesion (data not
shown). The remaining binding sites were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for
2 h at 37jC. 5  104 MC/9 mast cells in complete culture medium were
preincubated with different concentrations of recombinant endostatin (or
with BSA as a control) for 1 h at 37jC and added to the substrate-coated
wells. To induce the cell adhesion, stem cell factor (SCF; Sigma-Aldrich), at
35 Ag/mL, was added to the wells immediately after cell loading (19). Cells
were allowed to attach on substrate for 80 min at 37jC in 5% CO2, after
which the wells were washed twice with PBS to remove nonadherent cells.
Trypsin-EDTA was added to the wells to recover adherent cells. The
numbers of the recovered adherent and nonadherent living cells were
determined using a hemocytometer. Each well was done at least in
duplicate, and the experiment was repeated several times. To test the
specificity of endostatin, 5 Ag/mL of recombinant endostatin was
preincubated with 1 Ag/mL of antihuman endostatin antibody (HES.6;
ref. 20), or with a nonrelevant polyclonal IgG antibody (Santa Cruz, Inc.), for
1 h at room temperature before adding to the cells.
Migration assay. The migration assay was performed by using 8.0-Am
pore size Transwell inserts (Greiner Bio One). Micropore filters were coated
overnight at 4jC with 40 Ag/mL of fibronectin in PBS, and the remaining
binding sites were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37jC. 5  104
MC/9 cells in complete culture medium were preincubated with different
concentrations of recombinant endostatin (or with BSA as a control) for
1 h at 37jC, and added to the upper chamber of the Transwell insert.
Complete medium supplemented with the chemoattractant SCF (35 Ag/mL)
was added in the lower chamber to induce the cell migration (19). Controls
without SCF were performed to determine the passive diffusion (always
<7%; data not shown). Cells were allowed to migrate for 8 h at 37jC in 5%
CO2. The numbers of the living cells in the upper and lower chamber were
counted separately using a hemocytometer. Each sample was assayed in
duplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. To test the specificity of
endostatin action, 5 Ag/mL of recombinant endostatin was preincubated
with 1 Ag/mL of antihuman endostatin antibody, or with a nonrelevant
polyclonal IgG antibody, as described above for the adhesion assay.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the tumors using Tri-pure
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 0.5 Ag
of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 100 ng of random hexamers
and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCR primers
for VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 were obtained
from a published study (21). Specific primers for 18S RNA were

5¶-GCAATTATTCCCCATGAACG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GGCCTCACTAAACCAT
CCAA-3¶ (antisense). The gene transcription was analyzed with the SYBR
green detection method using the Stratagene Mx3500P Real-time PCR
device (Stratagene). Each PCR was run in triplicate. The gene expression
data were normalized against 18S, and the control values were expressed as
1 to indicate a precise fold change.
Circulating endostatin. Serum samples collected from J4 and control
mice were used to determine the endostatin levels using the CytElisa Mouse
Endostatin enzyme immunoassay kit (Nordic Biosite AB) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis for most of the experiments was
performed using Student’s t test. Differences in histopathology and
metastasis formation between the groups were assessed using the m2 test
and confirmed with the Fisher’s exact test.

practice, the tumors began to emerge after a similar latency period
(7–8 weeks) in both strains, and no differences in incidence were
detected, as the same proportion of both the J4 mice and the wildtype mice (95%) developed papillomas upon chemical treatment
(Fig. 1A). Tumor multiplicity showed no changes in the J4 mice
either; the transgenic mice yielding an average of 9.0 papillomas
per mouse compared with 9.7 in the control group, but a sharper
decrease in the number of papillomas was observed in the J4 mice
after 30 weeks (not significant, t test; Fig. 1B). However, from the
20-week time point onwards, the papillomas in the J4 mice were
smaller in size than those in the wild-type mice, and this difference
was statistically significant (P < 0.05 at most time points and
P < 0.001 in several time points, t test; Fig. 1C). In addition,
histopathologic evaluation of the skin lesions at 13 weeks time
point showed that there was a delay in the development of the
papillomas in the J4 mice at an early stage in skin carcinogenesis,
36% having papillomas at week 13 compared with 64.7% of the
wild-type mice (P < 0.05, t test; Table 1).
The mice were evaluated for the development of skin SCC, but
no significant differences in the time of appearance of carcinomas
were found between the J4 and wild-type mice, or in the rate of
malignant conversion at the end of the experiment (70% and 68%,
respectively; Table 1; data not shown). Nevertheless, the histopathologic analysis of the SCCs revealed clear differences in
keratinocyte differentiation between the controls and the J4 mice
(Table 1 and Fig. 1D); those in the J4 mice being more often welldifferentiated at week 34, whereas moderately or poorly differentiated SCCs were more common in the control mice (P = 0.001, m2
test; Table 1 and Fig. 1D). The depth of local invasion of the SCCs
seemed to be higher in the control group, in which the cancers
more often extended into the s.c. tissues and muscular layer (75%
versus 55% in the J4 mice), but this difference was not statistically
significant (P = 0.210, m2 test; data not shown). Moreover,
histopathologic analysis of the autopsy samples collected from
most of the mice bearing SCCs indicated that lymph node

Results
Endostatin modulates skin carcinogenesis. The multistage
mouse skin carcinogenesis protocol leads to the outgrowth of
highly differentiated benign papillomas that can progress to
malignant SCCs and often also to metastatic dissemination into
the lymph nodes (16). We applied this carcinogenesis model to
transgenic J4 mice, which show a clear increase in monomeric
endostatin in the skin and the lens capsule (13), and measured the
concentrations of circulating endostatin. These were f7-fold
higher (189 F 55 ng/mL) than in the control FVB/N mice (27 F 6.9
ng/mL) and increased further in both strains upon cancer
induction, although relatively less so in the control mice, so that
levels of 495 F 61 ng/mL (2.6-fold) were reached in the tumorbearing J4 mice versus 35.5 F 10.8 ng/mL (1.3-fold) in the tumorbearing wild-type mice.
A comparison of carcinogen-induced skin tumorigenesis between the J4 mice and the wild-type control mice in three
experimental groups (13, 24, and 34 weeks) is presented in Table 1
and Fig. 1. In view of the well-documented antitumor effects of
endostatin (2), we expected to find a lower tumor incidence and/or
multiplicity and/or smaller tumor size in the J4 mice, but in

Endostatin Overexpression Inhibits Lymphangiogenesis

Figure 1. Carcinogen-induced skin tumorigenesis in endostatin-overexpressing J4 and control (wild-type; WT ) mice. Tumors were induced in the mouse skin
using a multistage DMBA-TPA protocol and their formation was monitored for 34 wk. Tumor incidence (A ), tumor multiplicity (B), and tumor size (number of tumors
>2 mm in diameter divided by the total number of mice; C) were recorded. Histopathologic classification of skin SCCs at wk 34. D, grade of differentiation (left ; ,

metastases at 34 weeks were statistically more frequent in the wildtype mice (40% in the control mice versus 7.7% in the J4 mice;
P < 0.05, m2 test; Fig. 1D).
Effects of endostatin on tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. A statistically significant difference in the number of
blood vessels between the two mouse strains was found only in the
tumors collected at 13 weeks, where the capillary densities in the
central tumor area were markedly lower in the J4 mice, as also were
those in the area surrounding the tumor. The average number of
blood vessels in the tumor area was 9.09 F 2.18 per field in the J4
mice, which was markedly lower than in the wild-type mice, 14.1 F
3.97 per field (P = 0.009, t test), whereas the difference in vessel
densities was smaller in the peritumoral area (11.4 F 2.15 per field
in the J4 mice versus 15.2 F 3.7 in the control mice; P = 0.011,
t test; Fig. 2A). No significant differences in blood vessel densities
were observed between the two mouse strains in the other
experimental groups; that is, at 24 and 34 weeks after DMBA
treatment, neither in terms of papillomas nor of SCCs (Fig. 2A; data
not shown).
The difference in lymph node metastases between the J4 and
control mice prompted us to study the possible effects of
endostatin overexpression on lymphangiogenesis. Because the
tumor area itself was found to contain very few lymphatic vessels,
their numbers were calculated only in the area surrounding the
tumor. A decrease in the numbers of Lyve-1–positive vessels was
detected in this area within the SCC samples collected from the J4
mice at 34 weeks (P = 0.008, t test) and in the benign papillomas at
the same point in time (P = 0.007, t test; Fig. 2B–D). A statistical
difference in the numbers of lymphatic vessels within skin tumors
was also noted at other time points (P = 0.007 and P = 0.004 in the
papillomas at 13 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively, and P = 0.013 in

www.aacrjournals.org

the SCCs at 24 weeks). Furthermore, the J4 mouse skin outside the
carcinogen-treated area contained significantly less Lyve-1–positive
vessels (P = 0.009, t test), suggesting that endostatin overexpression
affects the development of the cutaneous lymphatic system in
these mice (Fig. 2D).
Effects of endostatin on cell proliferation and apoptosis in
skin tumors. We evaluated the effects of endostatin overexpression on apoptosis by calculating the TUNEL-positive cells
in tumor sections. An increase in the incidence of apoptotic
keratinocytes was detected both in papillomas and SCCs in the
transgenic J4 mice relative to the control mice (Fig. 3A), a
difference that was already evident at an early stage in tumor
development (at 13 weeks; P = 0.01, t test) and remained significant
throughout the process of malignancy. Cell death was even higher
in the late-stage benign papillomas of the J4 mice (at 34 weeks;
P = 0.0006 between the mouse strains, t test) than in the samples
collected at earlier time points. The SCC samples collected from
the J4 mice also showed increased numbers of apoptotic
keratinocytes at the two later time points, again with a statistical
difference between them (P < 0.05 at 24 weeks and 34 weeks, t test).
Elevated endostatin expression had an inhibitory effect on the
proliferation of keratinocytes. At an early stage in tumor
development (13 weeks), the number of Ki67-positive cells was
significantly higher in the tumor samples derived from wild-type
mice than in those derived from the J4 mice (P = 0.0004, t test;
Fig. 3B), whereas at later time points, the numbers of proliferating
cells did not show significant differences between the two mouse
strains.
Endostatin overexpression decreases the mRNA levels of
lymphangiogenesis-related VEGF signaling components. To
determine whether the difference observed in the numbers of

tumor lymphatic vessels between the endostatin-overproducing
mice and the controls might involve changes in the expression of
VEGF family ligands or receptors, a real-time PCR analysis was
carried out using total RNA extracted from papillomas collected at
week 34. mRNA expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-2
showed no differences between J4 and control mice, but the
expression of VEGF-C decreased almost 7-fold, and mRNA for
its receptor VEGFR-3 decreased 15-fold in tumors of the J4 mice
(Fig. 4A).
Endostatin overexpression reduces the number of VEGF-C–
producing mast cells. We next asked which cells contribute to the
expression of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR-3 in skin tumors.
VEGF-C is produced by tumor cells in many cancers (22) but also
by tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells, in particular macrophages
and mast cells (23–25), and the numbers of these cells have been
shown to correlate with blood and lymphatic vessel densities
(24–26) and with the frequency of lymph node metastasis (24, 25).
Immunohistochemical staining of VEGF-C in J4 and control
papillomas at 34 weeks revealed that it is strongly expressed by
inflammatory mast cells in the peritumoral area, as identified by
Leder’s method (Fig. 4B), but also to some extent by keratinocytes
in the SCCs (data not shown). Interestingly, there was a significant
reduction in the numbers of mast cells in tumors of the same
differentiation grade in the endostatin-overexpressing J4 mice at
weeks 24 and 34 by comparison with the control mice, with
P values of 0.0035 and 0.042, respectively (t test; Fig. 5A and B).
Macrophages were abundant in the peritumoral area and in the
surrounding stroma of both mouse strains at all stages of
carcinoma development (data not shown). We could not detect
any differences in their numbers between the J4 and control mice
nor could we confirm the production of VEGF-C by these cells.
Staining of serial papilloma sections with the antibodies for
VEGFR-3 and Lyve-1 indicated that VEGFR-3 was expressed by the
Lyve-1–positive lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 4C).
Endostatin inhibits the adhesion and migration of mast
cells on fibronectin. The tissue distribution of mast cells is
regulated by the interactions between their cell surface receptors
and the extracellular matrix (27). We hypothesized that endostatin
might directly control the trafficking of mast cells into the tumor
tissue, and tested this by studying the effects of recombinant
endostatin on the adhesion and migration of murine MC/9 mast
cells on fibronectin-coated surfaces. As Fig. 5C shows, endostatin
inhibited the SCF-induced adhesion of MC/9 cells to fibronectin in
a concentration-dependent manner. Of the untreated control cells,
up to 72% adhered to fibronectin in the presence of SCF, whereas
treatment with 10 Ag/mL of endostatin decreased the cell adhesion
to 37% (P < 0.001, t test; Fig. 5C). The antiendostatin antibody
HES.6 was able to block the inhibitory effect of endostatin and
restored the MC/9 cell adhesion to fibronectin to the level of the
control cells, whereas the addition of an unspecific polyclonal
antibody could not reverse the effect of endostatin on mast cells.
This showed that the reduction in the mast cell adhesion to
fibronectin was endostatin specific (Fig. 5C).
Similarly, we examined the potential effects of endostatin on the
mast cell migration using a Transwell assay. Endostatin also
inhibited the MC/9 cell migration in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 5D). Without endostatin treatment, 56% of the mast
cells migrated through the fibronectin-coated filters in response to
chemoattractant SCF, whereas in presence of 5 Ag/mL of
endostatin, the migration decreased to 25% (P < 0.001, t test;
Fig. 5D). As in the cell adhesion assays, the antiendostatin antibody,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

but not a nonrelevant IgG fraction, reversed the inhibitory effect of
endostatin on MC/9 cell migration, confirming that the effect was
specifically due to endostatin administration (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
We set out here to analyze the roles of endostatin in carcinogeninduced skin tumorigenesis by using transgenic J4 mice, which
overexpressed endostatin in their keratinocytes (13). We found that
elevated endostatin levels inhibited angiogenesis at an early stage
of tumor development, but this did not significantly alter tumor
incidence or multiplicity. Endostatin overproduction significantly
reduced the number of tumor lymphatics and also prevented
tumor cell dissemination into the lymph nodes, which, at least in
part, seems be due to the ability of endostatin to inhibit the
distribution of VEGF-C–producing mast cells in the tumor matrix
as shown by the in vitro mast cell adhesion and migration assays.
The elevated endostatin level also had a clear effect on the
differentiation of the skin tumors because the SCCs in the J4 mice

lymphangiogenesis by reducing the number of VEGF-C–producing
inflammatory mast cells in the tumor tissue, which subsequently
affects the amount of tumor metastasis.
Interestingly, the a5h1 and avh3 integrins, which mediate the
effects of endostatin on endothelial cells (8, 9), have been
implicated in the adhesion of human cutaneous mast cells to
fibronectin and vitronectin, respectively (34, 35). It is thus possible
that the binding of endostatin to these receptors inhibits mast cell
adhesion and migration on the tumor matrix, although this
remains to be shown. Furthermore, Coussens and coworkers (26)
showed that mast cells activate angiogenesis and neoplastic
progression during skin carcinogenesis in the mouse, and that
the angiogenic switch is dependent on the activation of pro–matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 matrix metalloprotease by the mast
cell serine protease. We have earlier reported that endostatin
inhibits activation of pro–MMP-9 in vitro (36), and thus, the
overproduction of endostatin may further decrease the amount of
active MMP-9 in tumors of J4 mice and thereby suppress
angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor progression.
We also showed a pronounced reduction in the mRNA
expression of VEGFR-3 within the papillomas of the J4 mice

were more often well differentiated, whereas those in the control
mice were frequently moderately or poorly differentiated.
Lymph node metastases were observed in only one of the 13
transgenic J4 mice bearing SCCs (7.7%), by comparison with 40% of
the corresponding control mice (6 of 15). Cancer cell metastasis to
distant organs occurs via the vascular and lymphatic systems, the
lymphatic system being more important in the case of SCCs
(28, 29). Moreover, several reports have shown that lymphangiogenesis correlates with lymph node metastases (30, 31). Our finding
of significantly less Lyve-1–positive vessels in the J4 mice than in
the control mice, both in papillomas and in SCCs, is consistent
with these observations and suggests that the reduction in lymph
node metastases may be due to the suppression of tumor
lymphangiogenesis induced by endostatin.
There are, to our knowledge, only two papers that describe
endostatin’s effects on lymphangiogenesis: Shao et al. (32) showed
that recombinant endostatin inhibits the proliferation and
migration of lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro, and Fukumoto
et al. (33) showed that endostatin inhibits lymphangiogenesis and
lymph expansion by down-regulating VEGF-C expression in
cultured SCC cells. We also showed down-regulation of VEGF-C
mRNA in papillomas in the presence of endostatin overproduction
(Fig. 4A). This may partly be due to decreased expression of VEGFC by the tumor cells, as the present study and others (19) showed
an expression of this endothelial growth factor by SCCs. We also
showed a strong expression of VEGF-C by tumor-associated
inflammatory mast cells and observed a notably reduced number
of mast cells in the skin tumors of the J4 mice. Furthermore, we
showed that endostatin inhibited the adhesion and the migration
of murine MC/9 mast cells on fibronectin in vitro. These data
suggest that elevated endostatin levels regulate the amount of

(Fig. 4A). Endostatin down-regulated the transcription of VEGFR-2
in endothelial cells (12), and thus, it is plausible that VEGFR-3
production could also be affected by elevated endostatin. However,
we think that the weak VEGFR-3 mRNA expression observed in the
J4 papillomas most likely reflects the loss of lymphatic vessels in
the tumors of the J4 mice.
Elevated endostatin had only minor effects on the induction and
progression of skin tumors and tumor angiogenesis. We showed a
decrease in blood vessels at early stage of tumor development in
the J4 mice, but at later time points, the vessel numbers were
comparable between the mouse strains. At 24 weeks, tumor
angiogenesis seemed to be even higher in the transgenic mice, but
this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.169 and 0.275
in tumor area and surrounding area, respectively, t test; Fig. 2A).
Effective therapeutic levels of circulating endostatin are up to 80 to
450 ng/mL, whereas too low and too high concentrations are
ineffective (2). In the J4 mice, the circulating endostatin levels were

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

f190 ng/mL and further increased in the SCC-bearing J4 mice up
to 500 ng/mL. As the exogenous endostatin is expressed by the
basal keratinocytes, it is possible that the local endostatin concentration in the skin tumors is too high for adequate angiogenesis
suppression. Furthermore, angiogenesis was shown to be an early
event in the DMBA-TPA–induced skin tumors and play a major
role in the development of the papillomas but not in the
premalignant progression (37). Consistently, we did not observe
differences in the conversion of the papillomas to SCCs between
the J4 and control mice, but the papillomas seemed smaller in the
endostatin-overexpressing mice (Fig. 1C).
We found an increase in proliferating keratinocytes in the wildtype mice at the early stage of skin tumor development, but
proliferation rates during tumor progression were comparable
between the J4 and wild-type mice. Furthermore, we observed an
increase in cell death in the J4 mice during progression to
malignancy to reach a very high level of apoptotic keratinocytes by

the end of the experiment (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data
suggest that endostatin delays tumor formation at an early stage by
inhibiting keratinocyte cell proliferation. Moreover, it induces
apoptosis of these cells, which counterbalances the effect of the
high tumor cell proliferation seen in this model, especially at the
late stage in tumor progression. These findings, together with
the moderately decreased angiogenesis, may explain the delay
in papilloma development in the J4 mice observed in the 13-week
experimental group (Table 1) and the smaller size of the papillomas
from 20 weeks onward (Fig. 1C). The effects of endostatin on
endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis are
acknowledged, but its role in epithelial cell behavior has not been
studied in detail. Our results regarding its inhibitory effects on
keratinocyte proliferation and inductive effects on keratinocyte
apoptosis in vivo support previous in vitro findings with respect to
its efficacy against epithelial cells as well (36, 38).
In summary, using an approach involving transgenic mice and a
chemical-induced skin cancer model, we have shown that in
addition to its antiangiogenic and accompanying antitumorigenic
effects, endostatin can reduce lymphangiogenesis and, subsequently, lymph node metastasis in mice, and modulate the differentiation
of epithelial tumor cells and the inflammatory reactions associated

with cancer. Using in vitro cell culture assays, we have showed that
the inhibitory effect of endostatin on lymphangiogenesis is, at least
in part, due to its ability to regulate the adhesion and migration of
VEGF-C–producing mast cells on extracellular tumor matrix. Our
findings thus support the concept of the ability of endostatin to
control a broad spectrum of signaling pathways in a coordinated
fashion, by different mechanisms and at different levels, to regulate
tumor cell differentiation and to restrict angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis, and subsequently, tumor progression and
metastasis.
