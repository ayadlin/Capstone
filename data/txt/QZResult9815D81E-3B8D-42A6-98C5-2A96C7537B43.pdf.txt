ABSTRACT
In our previous study, we found that (E)-2,4-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal
showed anti-cancer effect, but it showed lack of stability and drug likeness. We have
prepared several (E)-2,4-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal analogues by Heck reaction.
We selected two compounds which showed significant inhibitory effect of colon cancer
cell growth. Thus, we evaluated the anti-cancer effects and possible mechanisms
of one compound (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol in vitro
and in vivo. In this study, we found that (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2methoxyphenol induced apoptotic cell death in a dose dependent manner (0-15
μg/ml) through activation of Fas and death receptor (DR) 3 in HCT116 and SW480
colon cancer cell lines. Moreover, the combination treatment with (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitor,
phenylarsine oxide (0.1 μM) or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) inhibitor, Stattic (50 μM) increased the expression of Fas and DR3 more
significantly. In addition, (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
suppressed the DNA binding activity of both STAT3 and NF-κB. Knock down of STAT3
or NF-κB p50 subunit by STAT3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or p50 siRNA magnified
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol-induced inhibitory effect on
colon cancer cell growth. Besides, the expression of Fas and DR3 was increased in
STAT3 siRNA or p50 siRNA transfected cells. Moreover, docking model and pull-down
assay showed that (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol directly
bound to STAT3 and NF-κB p50 subunit. Furthermore, (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol inhibited colon tumor growth in a dose dependent manner
(2.5 mg/kg-5 mg/kg) in mice. Therefore, these findings indicated that (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol may be a promising anti-cancer agent for
colon cancer with more advanced research.

INTRODUCTION

cancer for men and after lung and breast cancer for
women [1]. On the other hand, colon cancer is also one
of the most curable cancers if it is detected in early stage
through regular colonoscopy [2]. Systemic chemotherapy
plays an integral part in advanced colon cancer treatments,

Colorectal cancer (CRC, also known as colon
cancer, bowel cancer) ranks third among the leading
causes of cancer-associated death after lung and prostate

however, 50% of patients respond poorly or have disease
progression due to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
[3]. As present treatments for colon cancer patients are
not so sufficient, it is urgent to develop appropriate novel
chemo-preventive compounds.
Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death
which has an important role in anti-cancer effects of
chemotherapeutics [4]. Activated death receptors (DRs)
induce apoptosis through caspase activation [5]. DRs are
activated by binding to their ligands (interaction of DR1
with TNF; Fas with FasL; DR3 with TWEAK; DR4 and
DR5 with TRAIL; Ligand of DR6 has not been exactly
defined) [6, 7]. Activation of death receptors induces
activation of caspase-8, which leads to the activation of
downstream caspases, including caspase-9 and caspase-3,
as well as the translocation of Bax to mitochondria leading
to apoptosis [8]. Increase of death receptor expression
could enhance susceptibility of cancer cells toward
chemotherapeutics [9].
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3
(STAT3) belongs to the STAT family of proteins, which
are both signal transducers and transcription factors [10].
STAT3 is a key signal transduction protein that mediates
signaling by many cytokines, hormones, growth factors,
and oncoproteins [11]. Once theses ligands bind to the
specific transmembrane STAT3 receptor, STAT3 becomes
activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerizes
through reciprocal Src homology 2-phosphotyrosine
binding, and the dimeric STAT3 translocates to the
nucleus, where it binds to consensus STAT3 binding
sequences within the promoter region of target genes and
thereby activates their transcription [11]. Phosphorylation
of STAT3 performs a vital function in cell growth,
proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis,
metastasis and angiogenesis [14-17]. Constitutively
activated STAT3 has been identified in many cancers
including colon cancer [18]. Studies in the past few
years have provide compelling evidence for the critical
role of aberrant STAT3 in malignant transformation and
tumorigenesis, thus, it is now generally accepted that
STAT3 is one of the critical players in human cancer
formation and represents a valid target for novel anticancer drug design [10]. Selected natural inhibitors
of the STAT3 signaling pathway are Betulinic acid,
Butein, Caffeic acid, Capsaicin, Celastrol, Cucurbitacins,
Curcumin, Diosgenin, Guggulsterone, Honokiol and so
on [13]. As STAT3 is activated by dimerization and then
binds DNA to perform its functions, specific inhibitors
targeting the disruption of their protein-protein binding
or DNA-binding activity, are more promising agents [13].
On the other hand, drugs aimed at multiple
pathways can be more efficacious and less vulnerable
to acquire resistance because the disease system is less
able to compensate for the action of two or more drugs
simultaneously, and this approach can be particularly
beneficial in cancers because oncogenesis is known to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be a multistep process [13, 19]. NF-κB is constitutively
activated in human colorectal carcinoma tissue and
colon cancer cells [20]. NF-κB plays a crucial role in
the suppression of apoptosis as well as in the induction
of cell proliferation and inflammation, NF-κB is closely
associated with cancer development [21]. NF-κB acts
as a cell survival factor through its regulatory role in the
expression of an array of apoptotic (caspase-3 and Bax),
antiapoptotic (Bcl-2 and IAP family), and cell proliferation
genes (cyclooxygenase-2 and cyclins) [22]. NF-κB
and STAT3 are rapidly activated in response to various
stimuli including stresses and cytokines, although they
are activated by entirely different signaling mechanisms.
Once activated, NF-κB and STAT3 control the expression
of anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative and immune response
genes some of which overlap and require transcriptional
cooperation between the two factors [23]. Therefore,
inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3 by chemotherapeutics
is intended as a potential strategy to eliminate cancerous
cells through induction of apoptosis.
Our previous study showed that (E)-2,4-bis(phydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal has anti-cancer activity [24].
Recently, to enhance the stability and drug likeness of
(E)-2,4-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal, we synthesized
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
by Heck reaction, and we found that this compound has
more stable and drug likeness properties. Therefore, in this
study we investigated the anti-cancer effects and possible
mechanisms of (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2methoxyphenol on colon cancer cell growth in vivo and
in vitro.

RESULTS
Effect of (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)2-methoxyphenol on the growth of colon cancer
cells
To evaluate the effect of (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
on
the
cell growth of colon cancer cells, we analyzed cell
proliferation assay. (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)2-methoxyphenol (0-20 μg/ml) induced cell death in colon
cancer cells but not normal cells (Figure 1A). IC50 values
of HCT116 and SW480 (Figure 1A) were 15.3 and 13.4
μg/ml, respectively. To determine whether the inhibition of
cell growth by the (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)2-methoxyphenol was due to the induction of apoptosis,
we evaluated the changes in colon cancer cells by using
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining followed
by TdT-mediated dUTP nick and labeling (TUNEL)
assays, and then the double labeled cells were analyzed
by fluorescence microscope. The cells were treated with

well as the expression of death receptors like Fas and
DR3 in a concentration dependent manner (0-15 μg/

Bcl-2 was decreased. To investigate the effect of knock
down of DRs on the (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol induced cell death, we performed
transfection experiment with siRNA. As a result, knock
down of Fas or DR3 partially reversed the inhibitory effect

and 15.7 μg/ml, respectively. These data indicated that
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
inhibited colon cancer cell growth with much lower doses
in comparison to (E)-2,4-Bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal.
In the present study, we found that (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol

increased the expression of apoptotic proteins such as
Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8 as well as
the expression of death receptors like DR3 and Fas in a
concentration dependent manner. However, the expression
of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased. Several
anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Survivin and members of
the Bcl family (Bcl-xl, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) which are known
to be crucial for tumor cell survival, are direct target
genes of STAT3 and are down-regulated as a consequence
of STAT3 inhibition [25]. Several studies have proposed

In this study, we prepared (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol without the

findings showed that STAT3 binding affinity of (E)-4-(3(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol was -8.1

data showed that cancer cell growth was inhibited by
treatment with (E)-2,4-Bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal in
SW620 and HCT116 colon cancer cells with IC50 values 27

carcinogenesis [26, 27]. Besides, inhibition of JAK1,2/
STAT3 signaling induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest,
reduces tumor cell invasion in colorectal cancer cells
[28]. Ursolic acid inhibits the growth of colon cancerinitiating cells by inhibition of STAT3 [29]. CAY10598
induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells through the generation
of ROS and inactivation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling [30].
Expression of p-STAT3 was immunohistochemically
examined and was found 57.4% in 108 cases of colorectal
adenocarcinoma tissue obtained at surgey [27]. In
agreement with this notion, our present data showed that
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
suppressed DNA binding activity of STAT3. The present
data also showed that (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol directly bound to STAT3, and then
blocked the activity of STAT3. Besides, docking model
exactly showed that (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)2-methoxyphenol bound in between coiled coil domain
(CCD) and DNA binding domain (DBD) of STAT3 (bound
inside a flight pocket comprised of Ala241, Lys244,
Arg245, Gln247, Val322, Val323, Gln326, Leu453,
Thr456, His457, Asn485 and Pro487). Moreover, (E)-4(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol-induced
inhibitory effect of cancer cell growth was magnified by
knock down of STAT3 with STAT3 siRNA. These data
indicate that STAT3 plays a critical role in (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol-induced anticancer effect in human colon cancer cells.
Besides, NF-κB is also involved in growth arrest
and apoptosis by suppressing the expression of various
target genes such as Bax, caspase-3, caspage-9 and
activating Bcl-2 and Survivin [31, 32]. Increased nuclear
translocation of NF-κB was found in colorectal carcinoma
patients and it was demonstrated that the activation of
NF-κB was correlated with tumor progression [33].
Tumor-associated macrophages from p50 deficient mice
regained a proinflammatory (M1) phenotype associated
with reduced tumor growth [34]. Blocking NF-κB can
cause tumor cells to cease proliferation or become more
sensitive to the action of antitumor agents [35]. Several
agents have shown their anti-cancer activity through
inhibition of NF-κB. In our previous study, we found
that inflexinol inhibited colon cancer cell growth through
inhibition of NF-κB via direct binding to NF-κB p50
subunit [36]. In this study, our data also showed that
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
suppressed DNA binding activity of NF-κB. The decrease
of NF-κB DNA binding activity was associated with
the inhibitory effect of (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol on the IκB phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation of NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits.
Moreover, co-treatment with NF-κB inhibitor, PAO
(0.1 μM) and (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2methoxyphenol (10 μg/ml) inhibited colon cancer cell
growth more significantly. However, deletion of p50 by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

siRNA magnified (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2methoxyphenol-induced inhibitory effect on colon cancer
cell growth. In addition, docking model showed that
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
bound near to the DNA binding site (in a pocket created by
Phe353, Tyr357, Val358, Glu360, Gly361, Pro362, Ser363,
His364, Gly365, Val412, Cys416, Asp418 and Leu440).
Thus, it is possible that (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol inhibits colon cancer cell growth
via inhibition of both STAT3 and NF-κB pathways.
Activated STAT3 in cancer cells can ensure constitutive
NF-κB activation, even when the IKK complex is only
temporarily activated [38]. Despite their potential side
effects, inhibition of STAT3 and NF-κB may represent a
good approach to combat cancer [23]. Studies have also
shown that constitutive STAT3 activation is associated
with the inhibition of death receptor mediated apoptosis
[39]. Similarly, NF-κB directly inhibits Fas transcription
to suppress Fas-mediated apoptosis and tumor suppression
[40]. STAT3 and NF-κB cooperate to promote the
development and progression of colon cancer [23], and
thus prevent cell death through inhibition of the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway which is activated upon binding of
extracellular ligands to cell-surface DRs [39].
It was also reported that several promising anticancer compounds induced apoptotic cell death through
activation of DRs. The snake venom toxin from Vipera
lebetina turanica induced the apoptosis of colon
cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) dependent death
receptor (DR4 and DR5) expression [41]. Garcinol, a
polyisoprenylated benzophenone derivative, derived from
dried rind of the fruit Garcinia indica can potentiated
TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death of human colon
cancer cell through up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 [42].
Zerumbone enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis through
the induction of death receptors in human colon cancer
cells [43]. Similarly, our findings showed that (E)-4-(3(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol induced
apoptotic cell death through activation of Fas and DR3
in colon cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of
Fas and DR3 was increased more significantly in STAT3
siRNA or p50 siRNA transfected cells. Similarly, cotreatment with (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2methoxyphenol and STAT3 inhibitor Stattic (50 μM) or
PAO (0.1 μM) increased the expression of Fas and DR3
more significantly. In addition, we also evaluated the anticancer effect of (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)2-methoxyphenol on colon tumor growth. As a result,
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
inhibited colon tumor growth in a dose dependent manner
(2.5 mg/kg-5 mg/kg). And the expression level of Fas,
DR3, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8 and Bax was
increased while the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased in
a dose dependent manner (2.5 mg/kg-5 mg/kg). Moreover,
the DNA binding activities of both STAT3 and NF-κB

were suppressed in a dose dependent manner (2.5 mg/
kg-5 mg/kg).
In conclusion, (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol could inhibit cell growth of colon
cancer in vivo and in vitro through activation of Fas, DR3
and inhibition of STAT3 and NF-κB pathways. Therefore,
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
may be a promising anti-cancer agent for treatment of
colon cancer.

of 5% CO2 at 37 oC.

Cell viability assay
Colon cancer cells HCT116 and SW480 were
cultured in 96-well plates for 24 h, then were treated with
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol
(0- 20 μg/ml) for 24 h. After treatment, cell viability
was measured by MTT [3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide] assay (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to cells and plates were
incubated at 37 oC for 2-4 h before dimethyl sulfoxide
(100 μl) was added to each well. Finally, the absorbance
of each well was read at a wavelength of 540 nm using a
plate reader.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Heck reaction was used for the synthesis starting
from phenyl halide moieties with substituents (2.0 mmol)
and allylbenzene moieties with substituents (2.0 mmol).
Phenyl halide (2.0 mmol) and allylbenzene (2.0 mmol)
were added with triphenylphosphine (105 mg, 0.4 mmol),
Pd(OAc)2 (44.9 mg, 0.2 mmol), and tributylamine (451
mg, 1.9 mmol) in a 25 ml round bottom flask and the
reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at 45 oC under argon
atmosphere. The product was purified by flash silica gel
chromatography using hexane and ethyl acetate (3:1
mixture v/v) as the mobile phase.

Apoptosis evaluation
Colon cancer cells HCT116 and SW480 were
cultured on 8-chamber slides for 24 h and then were
treated with (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2methoxyphenol (0-15 μg/ml) for 24 h. TUNEL assays
were performed by using the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric
TUNEL System (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total number
of cells in a given area was determined by using DAPI
(Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) staining.
The cells were then observed through a fluorescence
microscope (Leica Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany).
The apoptotic index was determined as the number of
TUNEL-positive stained cells divided by the total cell
number counted x100%.

Western blotting
Colon cancer cells treated with (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol (0-15 μg/ml)
for 24 h were homogenized with a protein extraction
solution (PRO-PREPTM, Intron Biotechnology), and
lysed for 60 minutes incubation on ice. The cell lysate
was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 oC.
Equal amount of proteins (40 μg) were separated on a
SDS/12%-polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to a
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Water
and Process technologies, Trevose, PA, USA). Blots
were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v)
non-fat dried milk in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20
[TBST: 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl solution
containing 0.05% Tween-20]. After a short washing in
TBST, the membranes were immunoblotted with the
following primary antibodies: caspase-3, caspase-8
(1:1000 dilutions; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and

Cell culture
The HCT116, SW480 colon cancer cell lines and
CCD-18Co colon epithelial normal cell line were obtained

and washed in distilled water on a sintered glass filter,
then washed with the coupling buffer. Epoxy-activated
Sepharose 6B beads were added to the (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol-containing
coupling buffer and rotated at 4 oC for overnight. After
washing, unoccupied binding sites were blocked with 0.1
M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) 2 h at room temperature. The
(E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenolconjugated Sepharose 6B was washed with three cycles of
alternating pH wash buffers (buffer I: 0.1 M acetate and
0.5 M NaCl, pH 4.0; buffer II: 0.1 M Tris-HCl and 0.5 M
NaCl, pH 8.0). The control unconjugated epoxy-activated
Sepharose 6B beads were prepared as described above in
the absence of (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2methoxyphenol. The cell lysate was mixed with (E)-4-(3(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol-conjugated
Sepharose 6B or Sepharose 6B at 4 oC for overnight.
The beads were then washed on time with TBST. The
bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer. The
proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting with antibodies against STAT3 and p50
(1:1000 dilutions, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
The DNA binding activity of STAT3 was
determined using EMSA according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (Promega). In short, HCT116 and
SW480 cells were cultured on 100-mm culture dishes.
After treatment with (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol for 2 h, the cells were washed
twice with PBS, followed by the addition of 1 ml of
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were
scraped into a cold eppendorf tube. The cells were lysed
in ice-cold buffer A (10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10
mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.1% protase
inhibitor, 0.1% phosphatase inhibitor and 0.5% NP40) for
30 minutes, and centrifuged for 6 minutes at 6,000 rpm.
The residual pellet was resuspended in buffer C (10 mM
HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF,
0.1% protase inhibitor, 0.1% phosphatase inhibitor, 420
mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol). After
incubation at 4 oC for 1 h, the lysate was centrifuged for
15 minutes at 13,000 rpm and then nuclear extracts were
prepared and processed for EMSA as previously described.
The relative densities of the DNA-protein binding bands
were scanned by densitometry using MyImage (SLB), and
quantified by Labworks 4.0 software (UVP, Inc., Upland,
CA).

Docking experiment
Docking studies between STAT3 or p50 and (E)4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol was
performed using Autodock VINA [44]. Only one monomer
of the homo-dimeric STAT3 or p50 crystal structure was
used in the docking experiment and conditioned using
AutodockTools by adding all polar hydrogen atoms.
Three dimensional structures of STAT3-DNA complexes
and p50-DNA complexes were retrieved from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB codes: STAT3-3CWG, p50-1VKX).
Starting from the co-crystallized complexes, the STAT3
or p50 monomer chain, (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)
allyl)-2-methoxyphenol for docking were prepared using
Maestro graphical interface. The grid box was centered
on the STAT3 or p50 monomer and the size of the grid
box was adjusted to include the whole monomer. Docking
experiments were performed at various exhaustiveness
values of the defaults: 16, 24, 32, 40 and 60. Molecular
graphics for the best binding model was generated using
Discovery Studio Visualizer 2.0.

Transfection of siRNA
Colon cancer cells were plated in 6-well plates (2
x 105 cells / well) and were transiently transfected with
siRNA, using a mixture of siRNA and the WellFectEX PLUS reagent in OPTI-MEM, according to the
manufacturer’s specification (WelGENE, Seoul, Korea).
The transfected cells were treated with (E)-4-(3-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)-2-methoxyphenol (10 μg/ml) for
24 h and then used for detecting cell viability and protein
expression.

line HCT116 cells were injected subcutaneous (1 x 107
cells/0.1 ml PBS/animals) with a 27-gauge needle into
the right lower flanks in carrier mice. After 14 days, when
the tumors had reached an average volume of 100-150
mm3, the tumor-bearing nude mice were intraperitoneally
(i.p.) injected with (E)-4-(3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)allyl)2-methoxyphenol (2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg dissolved in
0.01% DMSO) twice per week for 3 weeks. The group
treated with 0.01% DMSO was designed as the control.
The weight and tumor volume of the animals were
monitored twice per week. The tumor volumes were
measured with vernier calipers and calculated by the
following formula: (A x B2)/2, where A is the larger and
B is the smaller of the two dimensions. At the end of
the experiment, the animals were sacrificed. The tumors
were separated from the surrounding muscles and dermis,
excised and weighed.
