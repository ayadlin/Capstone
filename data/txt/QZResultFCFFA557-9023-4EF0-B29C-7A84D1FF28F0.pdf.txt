Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in men. Hormone-refractory invasive PCa is the
end stage and accounts for the majority of PCa patient deaths.
We present here that plumbagin (PL), a quinoid constituent
isolated from the root of the medicinal plant Plumbago
zeylanica L., may be a potential novel agent in the control of
hormone-refractory PCa. Specific observations are the findings that PL inhibited PCa cell invasion and selectively
induced apoptosis in PCa cells but not in immortalized
nontumorigenic prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells. In addition,
i.p. administration of PL (2 mg/kg body weight), beginning
3 days after ectopic implantation of hormone-refractory
DU145 PCa cells, delayed tumor growth by 3 weeks and
reduced both tumor weight and volume by 90%. Discontinuation of PL treatment in PL-treated mice for as long as 4 weeks
did not result in progression of tumor growth. PL, at
concentrations as low as 5 Mmol/L, inhibited in both cultured
PCa cells and DU145 xenografts (a) the expression of protein
kinase CE (PKCE), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated Janus-activated kinase-2, and
phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3); (b) the DNA-binding activity of transcription
factors activator protein-1, nuclear factor-KB, and Stat3; and
(c) Bcl-xL, cdc25A, and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. The
results indicate for the first time, using both in vitro and
in vivo preclinical models, that PL inhibits the growth and
invasion of PCa. PL inhibits multiple molecular targets
including PKCE, a predictive biomarker of PCa aggressiveness.
PL may be a novel agent for therapy of hormone-refractory
PCa. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):9024–32]

metastatic PCa. There is an urgent need for novel agents that can
be effective and selective in the prevention and treatment of
hormone-refractory PCa. Plumbagin (PL), a medicinal plant–
derived naphthoquinone (7), seems to possess such properties.
PL (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone; Fig. 1A) was isolated
from the roots of the medicinal plant Plumbago zeylanica L. (also
known as Chitrak; ref. 7). The roots of Plumbago zeylanica have
been used in Indian medicine for more than 2,500 years for
treatments of various ailments. PL is also present in black walnut
and other various medicinal plants (7). PL has been shown to exert
anticancer and antiproliferative activities in animal models and in
cell culture (7). PL, fed in the diet (200 ppm), inhibits azoxymethane-induced intestinal tumors in rats (8). PL inhibits ectopic
growth of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (9), non–small cell lung
cancer A549 cells (10), and melanoma A375-S2 cells in athymic
nude mice (11). PL has also been shown to induce apoptosis in
human PCa cell lines (12). However, no study exists about the
effects of PL in the prevention and/or treatment of PCa
progression.
We present in this communication for the first time that PL is
a novel inhibitor of the growth and invasion of hormonerefractory PCa cells. I.p. administration of PL reduced both the
weight and volume of ectopically xenografted DU145 cells by
90%. PL inhibited PCa cell invasion and selectively induced
apoptosis in PCa cells. PL inhibited constitutive expression of
multiple molecular targets, including protein kinase Cq (PKCq),
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, and activation of
transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(Stat3) in PCa cells. PL may be a novel agent for therapy of
hormone-refractory PCa.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer
among men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths (1). The risk of PCa increases rapidly after age 50, with two
thirds of all PCa cases found in men after age 50. PCa first
manifests as an androgen-dependent (AD) disease and can be
treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Despite the initial
success of androgen ablation therapy, PCa progresses from AD to
androgen independent (AI). The hormone-refractory invasive PCa
is the end stage and accounts for the majority of PCa patient
deaths (2–6). At present, there is no effective treatment for AI

Chemicals, antibodies, and assay kits. PL (practical grade, purity
>95%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The sources of antibodies used
in this study were as follows: PKCq, other PKC isoforms, Stat3,
phosphorylated Stat3Tyr705, PI3K (p85), PI3K (p110), p21, p27, vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),
Bcl-xL, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cdc25A, and h-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phosphorylated Janus-activated kinase (pJAK)-1 (Tyr1022/1023),
pJAK-2 (Tyr1007/1008), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT; Ser473), pAKT (Thr308),
and AKT (Cell Signaling Technology); pStat3Ser727 (BD Biosciences); and
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Dako North America, Inc.).
The oligonucleotides for AP-1 (5¶-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3¶),
NF-nB (5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶), and Stat3 (5¶-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3¶) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Collagen-Based Cell Invasion Assay kit was from Millipore.
Cell lines. Cell lines (RWPE-1, CWR22rv1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Apoptosis. Percent of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by
flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide–stained cells (13).

Plumbagin Inhibits Prostate Cancer
Cell invasion assay. Cell invasion was assayed using a Collagen-Based
Cell Invasion Assay kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions (14). Briefly,
PCa cell lines at 80% confluency were serum starved for 18 to 24 h before
the assay. The cells were harvested and the pellet was gently resuspended in
serum-free medium. In the upper chamber, 0.5  106 cells per well were
plated in triplicates and incubated for 2 h at 37jC in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 before PL treatment. Both the insert and the holding well were
subjected to the same medium composition with the exception of serum.
The insert contained no serum, whereas the lower well contained 10% fetal
bovine serum that served as a chemoattractant. The untreated groups were
used as a control. Forty-eight hours after PL treatment, the cell invasion
assay was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells in the
insert were removed by wiping gently with a cotton swab. Migrated cells
sticking to the bottom side of the insert were stained with Cell Stain.
Invading cells on the bottom side of the membrane were photographed
using light inverted microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TS 100) at 40 magnification. In addition, the number of cells migrating to the bottom side
was estimated by colorimetric measurements at 560 nm according to
assay instructions. Mean F SE was calculated from three independent
experiments.
Ectopic DU145 tumor xenografts. Male athymic nude mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and raised in a pathogen-free
environment. Mice were used for experimentation 2 wk after acclimatization. DU145 cells (2.5  106 in Matrigel) were implanted on both flanks of
nude mice. The animals (n = 10) were treated with PL (2 mg/kg body weight
in 0.1 mL PBS, 5 d a week) by i.p. injection 3 d after cell implantation. The
untreated animals (n = 10) were used as a control. Mice were weighed
and examined twice weekly for the presence of palpable tumors. Tumor size
was measured by calipers and recorded. Tumor volume (V ) was determined
by the following equation: V = (L  W  H  0.5236), where
L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the xenograft
tumor. At the end of study, mice were euthanized and digital photographs
were taken of their tumors. The mean calculated tumor volume was plotted
as a function of time. After 11 wk, PL treatment was stopped and the growth
of the tumor was measured through 16 wk after cell implantation.

Statistical analysis. Statistical differences between the tumor volume
means of control and PL-treated mice were analyzed by Student’s t test.
Western blot analysis. Human PCa cells and xenograft samples were
lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), 200 mmol/L Na3VO4, 200 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L EGTA]. The
homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000  g for 30 min at 4jC. Whole-cell
lysate (25 Ag) was fractionated on 10% to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The
proteins were transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer
membrane (Amersham). The membranes were then incubated with the
indicated primary antibodies followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
secondary antibody and developed with Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and autoradiography using BioMax film (Kodak Co.). The
Western blot signals were quantitated by densitometric analysis using
TotalLab Nonlinear Dynamic Image analysis software (Nonlinear USA, Inc.).
Histology. Xenograft samples were fixed for 24 h in 10% neutral buffered
formalin, transferred to PBS (pH 7.4), and then embedded in paraffin.
Sections (4 Am thickness) of each specimen were cut for histologic and
immunohistochemical examination.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry was carried
out with rabbit anti-PKCq (1:200 dilution), rabbit anti-Stat3 (1:150 dilution),
or mouse anti-PCNA (1:150) antibody in a Lab Vision Autostainer 3600 and
PT module (Lab Vision) with a standard protocol for immunohistochemistry (14). Briefly, the samples of xenograft tumor were deparaffinized and
antigen retrieval was done by heating in citrate buffer (pH 6.0; Lab Vision)
at 98jC for 20 min and then incubated in peroxidase for 5 min to block
endogenous peroxidase. Nonspecific proteins were blocked with Biocare
Medical Terminator (Biocare Medical) for 10 min, and then samples were
incubated with appropriate primary antibody at room temperature for
60 min followed by HRP-labeled IgG secondary antibody (Biocare Medical)
for 40 min. Color was developed by incubating samples with diaminobenzidine (DAB)+ (Dako North America) for 1 min. CAT Hematoxylin
(Biocare Medical) was used for 1 min as a counterstain. The specific
staining of PKCq, Stat3, or PCNA in the sections was examined using

for 24 h. Cells were treated with 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 Amol/L of PL for 3 h.
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in a hypotonic
solution [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA
(pH 8.0), 0.1 mmol/L EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF,
0.5 mg/mL benzamide, 2 Ag/mL aprotinin, 2 Ag/mL leupeptin], with
detergent [NP40 at 6.25% (v/v)] followed by low speed (1,500  g for 30 s)
to collect nuclei. Nuclear proteins were extracted in a high-salt buffer
[20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.4 mol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0),
1 mmol/L EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 0.5 mg/mL
benzamide, 2 Ag/mL aprotinin, 2 Ag/mL leupeptin] and nuclear
membranes and genomic DNA were removed by high-speed (16,000  g )
centrifugation for 5 min. Nuclear protein extracts were stored at 70jC
until used. The nuclear protein extract was incubated in a final volume of 20
AL of 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 80 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol,
1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 100 Ag/mL poly(deoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic acid) for 15 min. g-32P–radiolabeled double-stranded
oligonucleotides of the consensus binding sequences of AP-1, NF-nB, or
Stat3 were then added and the complexes were incubated for 20 min at
room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5%

acrylamide gel containing 2.5% glycerol and 0.5 Tris-borate EDTA at room
temperature. Gels were dried and autoradiographed to determine binding
activity (14).

Results
PL inhibits invasion and induces apoptosis in PCa cells. Cell
invasion requires cells to migrate through an extracellular matrix
or basement membrane barrier by first enzymatically degrading
the barrier and then becoming established in a new location. Cell
invasion is exhibited by tumor cells during metastasis. The effects
of PL on the invasive ability of AI human PCa cell lines were
determined. In this experiment (Fig. 1C), PCa cells (DU145, PC-3,
and CWR22rv1) were treated with 5 or 20 Amol/L of PL for 48 h and
cell invasion was assayed using a Collagen-Based Cell Invasion
Assay kit (14). PL, at both 5 and 20 Amol/L concentration,
significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited the invasion of DU145, PC-3, and
CWR22rv1. The inhibitory effect of PL on cell invasion did not
differ among these cell lines (DU145, PC-3, and CWR22rv1; P > 0.1;
Fig. 1C and D). The effect of PL on the induction of apoptosis in
human PCa has recently been reported (12). PL induced apoptosis
in human PCa cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and C4-2) irrespective of
androgen responsiveness and p53 status. PL-induced apoptosis in
human PCa cells was associated with modulation of cellular redox
status and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 12). We
also determined the effects of PL on the induction of apoptosis in
PCa cell lines (DU145, CWR22rv1, and LNCaP) and nontumorigenic

immortalized prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells. PL at concentration
as high as 20 Amol/L did not significantly (P = 0.42) induce
apoptosis in RWPE-1 cells (Fig. 1B). PL at all concentrations
significantly (P < 0.009) induced apoptosis in PCa cell lines (DU145,
CWR22rv1, and LNCaP). AI PCa cells (DU145 and CWR22rv1) seem
to be more sensitive than AD PCa cells (LNCaP) to the induction of
apoptosis by PL (Fig. 1B).
PL inhibits growth of DU145 cells in athymic nude mice. In
this experiment (Fig. 2A and B), PL (2 mg/kg body weight) was
administered i.p. 3 days after ectopic implantation of hormone-

refractory DU145 cells. PL treatment delayed tumor growth by
3 weeks and significantly (P < 0.05) reduced both the tumor weight
and volume throughout the experimental period (Fig. 2A and B).
Discontinuation of PL treatment in PL-treated mice, for as long as
4 weeks, did not result in an increase in tumor growth (Fig. 2B). PL
treatment significantly (P = 0.000) inhibited PCNA expression and
constitutive expression of Stat3 and PKCq (Fig. 2C). In addition, PL
treatment inhibited the expression of VEGF and MMP-9 (Fig. 2D).
The PL-treated mice gained weight and exhibited no obvious toxic
effects.

PL-induced inhibition of PCa cell growth accompanies
inhibition of the expression of multiple molecular targets,
including PKCE. To obtain clues about the mechanism by which
PL may inhibit growth and invasion of PCa, we used both DU145
cells cultured in vitro and DU145 tumor xenografts from vehicletreated and PL-treated mice. The results are illustrated in Fig. 3.
PKCq expression and constitutive activation of Stat3 have been
shown to play a role in the progression of human PCa (14). Stat3
activation, which involves dimerization, nuclear translocation,
DNA binding, and transactivation of transcription, requires
phosphorylation of both Tyr705 and Ser727 (14). Stat3Tyr705
phosphorylation is mediated by a wide variety of growth factors
[e.g., interleukin-6 (IL-6)]. IL-6 signaling is mediated through JAK.
JAK-Stat is the classic pathway that has been shown to mediate
cellular responses to a variety of cytokines, including IL-6. In
response to IL-6, Stat3 is transiently associated with gp130 and
subsequently phosphorylated by JAKs on Tyr705 of Stat3. PKCqmediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation is also essential for both
optimal DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of Stat3 (14). A
shown in Fig. 3A to D, PL treatment inhibited the expression of
pJAK-2 and PKCq. PL-mediated inhibition of pJAK-2 and PKCq
expression accompanied inhibition of both Stat3Ser727 and
Stat3Tyr705 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A–D). The effects of PL on
the expression of other PKC isoforms were also determined (Fig. 4).
PL inhibited the expression of PKCq and PKCh1. PKCa expression
was slightly increased, whereas expression levels of other PKC
isoforms (PKCh, PKCg, PKCy, PKCD, PKCe, and PKCA) were
unaffected (Fig. 4). Constitutively activated PKCq is linked to cell
survival essential for maintenance of PCa. We observed in PCa
from TRAMP mice that PKCq expression accompanied up-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

regulation of phosphorylated PI3K and AKT, major components
of the cell survival pathway (14). These results prompted us to
analyze the effects of PL on the expression of PI3K and AKT in
DU145 cells and tumors. The results are shown in Fig. 5. PL
treatment inhibited the expression of the PI3K (p85) and PI3K
(p110) regulatory subunits and pAKT (Ser473 and Thr308; Fig. 5A
and B). We also observed that PL treatment induced the expression
of p21 and p27 (Fig. 5C and D).
PL treatment indiscriminately inhibits the DNA-binding
activity of transcriptional factors AP-1, NF-KB, and Stat3 in
PCa cell lines. Activation of PKCq and PI3K/AKT pathways
culminates in the activation of transcription factors (AP-1, NF-nB,
and Stat3), which drive the expression of cell survival genes (14).
Sandur and colleagues (1) have reported that PL-modulated cell
proliferation, carcinogenesis, and radioresistance may be due to
inhibition of NF-nB pathway. We found that PL inhibited the DNAbinding not only of NF-nB but also of AP-1 and Stat3 in PCa cell lines
DU145, PC-3, and CWR22rv1 (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of the DNA-binding
activity was observed at PL concentrations as low as 5 Amol/L
(Fig. 6A). Figure 6 also shows that PL inhibited the expression of
several cell survival genes (COX-2, cdc25A, and Bcl-xL; Fig. 6C and D).

Discussion
PCa is the most common type of cancer in American men and
ranks second to lung cancer in cancer-related deaths (1). Hormonerefractory invasive PCa is the end stage and accounts for the
majority of PCa patient deaths (2–7). Men with hormone-refractory
cancer are at high risk for developing bone metastasis, which
results in clinically significant skeletal morbidity (15–18). The

management of locally advanced PCa is difficult and complex
because the cancer often becomes unresponsive to current
chemotherapeutic agents. Several agents, such as selenium,
lycopene, soy products, green tea, pomegranate phenolics,
apigenin, and vitamins D and E, are effective in the prevention of
the induction of PCa (19–22). However, there is no agent that is in
fact effective and selective in the prevention and/or treatment of
late-stage hormone-refractory PCa. We present here that PL, a
quinoid constituent isolated from the roots of medicinal plant
Plumbago zeylanica L. (also known as Chitrak; ref. 7), induces
apoptosis and inhibits invasion of AI PCa cells (Fig. 1).
Administration of PL (2 mg/kg body weight), beginning 3 days
after ectopic implantation of hormone-refractory DU145 PCa cells,
delays tumor growth by 3 weeks and reduces both tumor weight
and volume by 90% (Fig. 2). In addition, PL abrogates the
expression of PKCq (Fig. 3), which plays a role in the development
and maintenance of AI PCa (14).
The results (Fig. 1) involving the induction of apoptosis in PCa
cells by PL are consistent with findings using other cancer cell lines,
such as ovarian cancer BG1 cells (23), cervical cancer cells (24), and
breast cancer cells (9). PL-induced apoptosis involves G2-M arrest
and generation of ROS (10). ROS-mediated inhibition of topoisomerase II has been suggested to be a mechanism contributing
to the apoptosis-inducing properties of PL (25). It is also noteworthy
that PL in breast cancer cell lines has been reported to trigger
autophagic cell death but not predominantly apoptosis (9).
We provide direct experimental evidence that PL has efficacy
in preclinical model of ectopic growth of PCa cells in nude mice

(Fig. 2). Inhibition of tumor growth may be the result of inhibition
of the expression of cell proliferative marker PCNA as well as
inhibition of the constitutive activation of cell survival markers
PKCq and Stat3 (Fig. 3).
Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality from cancer (15–18).
Cell migration and invasion play critical roles in cancer metastasis
(15–18). PL was observed to be a potent inhibitor of PCa cell
invasion (Fig. 1). The molecular mechanism linked to PL-induced
inhibition of PCa cell invasion may involve inhibition of the
expression of MMP-9 and VEGF (Fig. 1), the components in cell
invasion and metastasis (26–28).
PL inhibits PKCq expression and Stat3 activation (Figs. 3 and 4).
PKCq is a member of the novel PKC subfamily (29–33). PKCq is an
important component of the mechanism of induction and
progression of PCa (14). PKCq is overexpressed in human PCa
and PCa developed either in C57BL/6 or [C57BL/6  FVB] F1
TRAMP mice (14). The fact that PKCq expression is significantly
elevated in PCa and correlates with PCa aggressiveness (14, 34)
implies that PKCq is probably linked to the maintenance of AI PCa.
In this context, the pioneering work of Terrian and his associates
on the role of PKCq in prostate carcinogenesis, using PCa-derived
cell lines, is noteworthy (34–37). In their reports, PKCq overexpression transformed AD LNCaP tumor cells to AI cells (35). The
transformation of AD LNCaP cells to an AI variant was associated
with increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.
Antisense experiments established that endogenous PKCq plays
an important role in regulating the growth and survival of AI PCa
cells, suggesting that PKCq expression may be sufficient to

maintain PCa growth and survival after androgen ablation (35).
PKCq is a transforming oncogene and a predictive biomarker of
breast cancer and PCa (14).
PKCq associates with Stat3 and regulates Stat3 activation. Stat3
is activated by phosphorylation at both Tyr705 and Ser727 residues.
Constitutively activated Stats, particularly Stat3, have been found
in several human cancers (e.g., squamous cell carcinomas, head
and neck, breast, ovary, prostate, and lung; refs. 38–45). PKCq
activation transduces multiple signals involving inhibition of
apoptotic pathways and promotion of cell survival pathways.
PKCq-mediated cell survival pathway involves constitutive activation of Stat3. PKCq is an initial signal that regulates activation of
Stat3. PKCq may be a primary target of PL for prevention of AI PCa
progression.
PL inhibits the activation of PI3K/AKT (Fig. 5A and B). As
observed in PCa from TRAMP mice, PKCq expression accompanied
up-regulation of phosphorylated PI3K and AKT, major components
of the cell survival pathway (14). Consistent with these findings,
using CWR22 xenografts, it was shown by proteomic analysis that

the association of PKCq with Bax may neutralize apoptotic signals
propagated through the mitochondrial death signaling pathway
(46). In addition, integrin signaling links PKCq to the PKB/AKT
survival pathway in recurrent PCa cells (34). PL inhibits PKCq
overexpression, which correlates with PCa aggressiveness and
accompanies an increase in proteins that modulate apoptosis
(survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), and cell cycle progression (p21 and
p27; Fig. 5C and D).
It is notable that Sandur and colleagues (7) reported that PL is a
specific inhibitor of NF-nB and does not suppress activation of
other transcription factors AP-1 and Stat3 in KBM-5 (human
chronic myeloid leukemia) and U266 (human multiple myeloma)
cells. The discrepancy between our results with the PCa cell lines
(PC-3, DU145, and CWR22rv1) and their results with KBM-5 and
U266 cells may be due to cellular context.
In several repeat experiments, PL inhibited the constitutive
activation of AP-1, NF-nB, and Stat3 in AI PCa cell lines PC-3,
DU145, and CWR22rv1 but not in AD PCa cell line LNCaP. These
results indicate that androgen receptor (AR) status may determine

Plumbagin Inhibits Prostate Cancer

PL-induced suppression of transcription factors AP-1, NF-nB, and
Stat3. The mechanism by which PL suppresses the constitutive
activation of AP-1, NF-nB, and Stat3 in AI PCa cells is unclear.
However, PL inhibits constitutive expression of PKCq, which may
play a role in the activation of AP-1, NF-nB, and Stat3.
The role of PKCq in PL-induced inhibition of growth and
invasion of AI PCa is speculative. Most AI PCa continue to express
AR as well as the AD gene PSA, which indicates that these cells
maintain a functional AR signaling pathway despite castrate levels
of testosterone. Gene amplification and mutations in AR are
frequently observed in recurrent PCa, which may account for
hypersensitivity of the AR to low castrate level of androgens, and
altered ligand specificity (47). Increased AR activity in AI PCa is
perhaps caused by cross-talk of AR with multiple intracellular
signaling cascades, including peptide growth factors [epidermal
growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-h, and insulin-like
growth factor-I; ref. 48]. In this context, it is noteworthy that HER2/neu, a member of the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases,
activates the AR pathway in the absence of ligand (49). It remains
to be determined whether there is cross-talk between AR and PKCq
signal transduction pathway in the progression of AI PCa.
PL has also been extensively evaluated for toxic side effects in
rodents. Toxic side effects included diarrhea, skin rashes, and
hepatic and reproductive toxicity. These toxic side effects were
dose related. The LD50 for these side effects in mice was 8 to
65 mg/kg body weight for p.o. administration and 16 mg/kg body
weight for i.p. (7). PL has been reported to be nontoxic at doses
(2 mg/kg body weight i.p. or 200 ppm in diet) shown to elicit
chemopreventive and therapeutic effects (7). In addition, the

mutagenic activity of PL in Escherichia coli has been examined and
was negative in the Ames test (7).
In summary, PL, a plant-derived naphthoquinone, inhibits the
growth and invasion of AI PCa cells (Figs. 1 and 2). PL-induced
inhibition of PCa cell growth and invasion accompanies inhibition
of multiple targets, including PKCq and transcription factors AP-1,
NF-nB, and Stat3 (Figs. 3–6). The results (Figs. 1–6) presented have
led us to propose that PKCq is a master switch in the progression
and invasion of hormone-refractory PCa. PKCq directly or
indirectly via association with other protein kinases [e.g., Raf-1,
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1/2, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK]
phosphorylates Stat3Ser727. Constitutive activation of PKCq and
Stat3 is correlated with the aggressiveness of PCa (14). PI3K/PKD3/
AKT may phosphorylate AR, enabling to form dimers, thus
enhancing AR-DNA binding and gene expression (50). We
hypothesize that PL inhibits the expression of PKCq, an initial
signal in the development of AI PCa.
