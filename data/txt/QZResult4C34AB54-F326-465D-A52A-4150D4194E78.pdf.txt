ABSTRACT
Survivin, which is highly expressed and promotes cell survival in diffuse
malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM), exclusively relies on exportin 1 (XPO1/
CRM1) to be shuttled into the cytoplasm and perform its anti-apoptotic function.
Here, we explored the efficacy of Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE),
KPT-251, KPT-276 and the orally available, clinical stage KPT-330 (selinexor), in
DMPM preclinical models. Exposure to SINE induced dose-dependent inhibition of
cell growth, cell cycle arrest at G1-phase and caspase-dependent apoptosis, which
were consequent to a decrease of XPO1/CRM1 protein levels and the concomitant
nuclear accumulation of its cargo proteins p53 and CDKN1a. Cell exposure to SINE
led to a time-dependent reduction of cytoplasmic survivin levels. In addition, after
an initial accumulation, the nuclear protein abundance progressively decreased, as a
consequence of an enhanced ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation.
SINE and the survivin inhibitor YM155 synergistically cooperated in reducing DMPM
cell proliferation. Most importantly, orally administered SINE caused a significant antitumor effect in subcutaneous and orthotopic DMPM xenografts without appreciable
toxicity. Overall, we have demonstrated a marked efficacy of SINE in DMPM preclinical
models that may relay on the interference with survivin intracellular distribution
and function. Our study suggests SINE-mediated XPO1/CRM1 inhibition as a novel
therapeutic option for DMPM.

irradiation showed to be ineffective with a median survival
of about one year [2–4]. The advent of a loco-regional
strategy that combines aggressive cytoreductive surgery
(CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
(HIPEC) [3,4] significantly improved median survival up
to 40–92 months in selected series of patients, although
approximately 40–60% of patients still experience
recurrence [3–5]. For these patients, and for those who
are not eligible to CRS+HIPEC, the prognosis remains

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma
(DMPM) is an uncommon and locally aggressive tumor
that develops from mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal
cavity, and accounts for approximately 25–30% of all
mesotheliomas [1, 2]. The prognosis of DMPM is poor

severe due to the lack of effective alternative treatment
options, highlighting the need to develop new therapeutic
strategies.
Previous work from our lab suggests that
dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway may play a role
in DMPM resistance to chemotherapy and that survivin
and other Inhibitors of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family
members may represent new therapeutic targets [6].
Indeed, we found that RNAi-mediated survivin
knockdown in DMPM cells enhanced both spontaneous
and cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis [6], thus supporting
the notion that agents targeting survivin may provide
new treatment approaches for this disease. Survivin is a
structurally unique member of the IAP family and it is
involved both in the control of cell division and inhibition
of the apoptotic machinery [7]. Notably, sub-cellular
compartmentalization of survivin plays an essential role in
determining its bifunctional role [8]. Nuclear localization
of survivin is mainly involved in spindle monitoring at
mitosis, whereas cytoplasmic/mitochondrial survivin
counteracts pro-apoptotic signals by preventing caspase-9
and caspase-3 activation [8]. While the low molecular
weight of survivin allows its passive diffusion from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus, its export from the nucleus
back to the cytoplasm requires an interaction between
the exportin-1/chromosome maintenance protein 1
(XPO1/CRM1) and the specific leucine-rich nuclear
export signals (NES) within survivin. This interaction is
accomplished via the RanGTP/GDP axis [8, 9]. XPO1/
CRM1 is a key member of the importin β superfamily
of nuclear transport receptors that are involved in the
nucleo-cytoplasmic active transport of over 200 proteins,
including transcription factors, tumor suppressors, cellcycle regulators and proteins involved in programmed cell
death [10, 11].
Recently, a novel class of oral bioavailable smallmolecule Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE)
has been developed. These inhibitors bind specifically
to the NES-binding groove of XPO1/CRM1 and prevent
the interaction with its cargo proteins [12–14]. These
compounds have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in a
variety of experimental models of solid and hematologic
malignancies both in vitro and in vivo [12, 13, 15–29].
Among those, selinexor (KPT-330) is the most advanced
SINE with >500 hematologic and solid cancer patients
treated to date in a number of Phase I/II clinical trials.
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).
In the present study we investigated the therapeutic
potential of three SINE, namely KPT-251, KPT-276 and
selinexor, in patient-derived DMPM experimental models.
Our results show that XPO1/CRM1 inhibition significantly
impairs DMPM cells growth in vitro and in vivo, by
inducing a marked apoptotic response. Furthermore, we
provide evidence that SINE exert their pro-apoptotic effect
by controlling the sub-cellular localization of survivin
and subsequently modulating its expression through an
ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism.

SINE impair DMPM cell growth
The effect of SINE on cell growth of two human
DMPM cell lines (STO and MesoII, expressing wildtype and mutant TP53, respectively) (Supplementary
Table 1), was assessed by MTS assay following exposure
to increasing concentrations of KPT-251, KPT-276 or
selinexor. A dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell
growth was consistently observed in both cell lines after
treatment with the different compounds (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Figure S1A, B). However, while STO
cells showed a higher sensitivity to selinexor compared
to KPT-251 and KPT-276, with IC50 values of 0.07 ± 0.01,
0.23 ± 0.05 and 0.24 ± 0.02 μmol/L respectively,
MesoII cells showed a comparable sensitivity to all the
compounds with IC50 values of 0.35 ± 0.09, 0.36 ± 0.04
and 0.47  ±  0.04  μmol/L, respectively. In addition, at
concentrations up to 10 μmol/L, SINE did not alter the
growth of both normal human lung fibroblast (WI38) and
adult human prostate (RWPE-1) cell lines (Figure 1A).

SINE promote cell cycle arrest and induce
a caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death
in DMPM cells
Since XPO1/CRM1 mediates nuclear export of
several cell cycle regulatory proteins, including p53,
cyclin B1, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
1a (CDKN1a) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b
(CDKN1b) [9, 11], we set to determine the effect of SINE
on cell cycle progression. DMPM cells were exposed
to KPT-251, KPT-276 or selinexor (at predetermined
IC50 and IC80 of each cell line), and stained with propidium
iodide at 24, 48 and 72 hours-post treatment. Flow
cytometry profiles of nuclear DNA content revealed
that 24-hour treatment of STO cells with SINE was
sufficient to induce an accumulation of cells in G1 phase
and a reduction in the percentage of cells in S and G2/M
compartments (Figure 1B). G1 phase accumulation
markedly increased at 48 hours and reached a maximum
72 hours-post exposure to the highest doses of SINE (87.6
± 3.7%, 90.4 ± 1.8% and 96.1 ± 3.3% for KPT-251, KPT276, and selinexor, respectively) (Figure 1B). Although to
a lesser extent compared to STO cells, an increase in the
percentage of cells in G1 phase was appreciable following
72-hour exposure to the highest selinexor concentration in
MesoII cells (Figure 1B).
To verify whether SINE-induced tumor cell
growth inhibition was also dependent on the induction
of an apoptotic cell death, we analyzed the presence of
Annexin V+ cells 48 and 72 hours-post drug exposure by
flow cytometry. While the apoptotic cell fraction was <10%
in control cells at both time points, a marked dose- and
time-dependent increase in the percentage of Annexin V+
cells was observed in the treated STO and MesoII cells
13120

(Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S2). In addition, a
significant dose- and time-dependent increase in caspase-3
catalytic activity, as determined in vitro by the hydrolysis of
the specific fluorogenic substrate, was found after treatment
with each compound (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Figure  S3). Specifically, in STO cells exposed for
72 hours to KPT-251, KPT-276 and selinexor (IC80), the
catalytic activity of caspase-3 was 7-, 6- and 11-fold
higher, respectively, than that observed in control samples
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S3A). Similarly, a
21-, 23- and 33-fold increase in caspase-3 catalytic activity
was also observed in MesoII cells treated with KPT-251,
KPT-276 and selinexor, respectively (Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure S3A). Notably, the inhibitory effect
of SINE on cell growth was almost completely reverted
when DMPM cells were pretreated with the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk;
Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S3B) -which by
itself failed to impair cell growth (Figure 1D)-, providing
evidence that SINE induce a caspase-dependent apoptotic
cell death in DMPM cells.

12 ­hours-post treatment initiation, a progressive decrease
in nuclear survivin protein abundance was observed
(Figure 2A, 2B and Supplementary Figures S5 and S6),
resulting in a significant and time-dependent reduction of
total protein amount (Figure 2C, 2D).
It has been recently shown in triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) cells that inhibition of XPO1/CRM1 by
selinexor represses survivin transcription by inhibiting
STAT3 acetylation [22]. We therefore assessed STAT3
protein expression and acetylation in DMPM cells
following selinexor treatment by Western blot (Figure 2C).
However, no measurable effects on protein levels and
acetylation status were observed. Our data suggest that the
decrease of survivin protein abundance in DMPM cells is
not related to post-translational modifications of its wellknown transcriptional activator. Such a hypothesis is also
corroborated by the evidence that exposure of DMPM
cells to selinexor did not affect survivin mRNA expression
(Figure 2E).
Since it has been reported that the forced retention
of survivin in the nucleus promotes its clearance by
the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway [30],
we checked whether selinexor-mediated XPO1/CRM1
inhibition might lead to the ubiquitination of survivin
nuclear fraction. Western blot experiments indicated that
exposure of DMPM cells to selinexor resulted in multiple
ubiquitination of survivin, which increased its molecular
weight up to 100 kDa (Figure 2F). These results suggest
that in DMPM cells the reduction of survivin nuclear
fraction by selinexor is ascribable at least in part to its
proteasome-dependent degradation. Indeed, exposure of
STO cells to the proteosome inhibitor Bortezomib partially
restored nuclear survivin levels in selinexor treated cells
(Figure 2B, 2D and Supplementary Figure S6).

SINE modulate nuclear levels of XPO1/CRM1
and its cargo proteins
To better understand the mechanism underlying
SINE cytotoxic effect, we determined the levels of
expression of XPO1/CRM1 and its cargo proteins p53
and CDKN1a before and after treatment. Consistently with
previous works in different tumor type models [13, 17, 19,
21–23, 25], immunoblotting analysis revealed that nuclear
XPO1/CRM1 expression progressively decreased after
SINE treatment (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S4).
In addition, the compounds induced nuclear accumulation
of p53 as early as 4 hours-post treatment initiation in both
cell lines, whereas CDKN1a nuclear accumulation was
observed only in STO cells (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Figure S4).

SINE synergistically cooperate with YM155 to
inhibit DMPM cell proliferation
The combined effects of SINE and the survivin
inhibitor YM155 -found to induce a time-dependent
survivin decrease at both mRNA and protein level
(Supplementary Figure S7)- were investigated in
DMPM cells. In combination experiments, cells were
simultaneously exposed to increasing concentrations of
SINE and YM155for short (72 hours) and long (10 days)
time periods, and the cytotoxic activity was assessed
by MTS assay. Under both treatment conditions, SINE
effectively cooperated at all concentrations with YM155 to
inhibit DMPM cell growth (Figure 3A and Supplementary
Figure S8). In fact, when cells were treated with the drug
combinations, the inhibition of cell proliferation was
consistently greater than that expected by simple additivity
of the effects of the individual drugs (Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure S8). Such a synergistic interaction
was drug concentration-dependent, as indicated by the

SINE interfere with the subcellular localization
of survivin and induce its down-regulation
through the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway
Survivin is a key anti-apoptotic protein and a
cargo of XPO1/CRM1 [7–9]. Previous work has shown
that its subcellular localization determines its function
[8, 10]. Therefore, we first assessed the effect of SINE
on the subcellular compartmentalization of survivin by
Western blot and ELISA. Interestingly, SINE treatment
(at IC50) induced nuclear accumulation of survivin
concomitant with a time-dependent cytoplasmic reduction
(Figure 2A, 2B and Supplementary Figure S5). Survivin
nuclear accumulation was observed as early as 2 hours-post
exposure to each compound and it reached a maximum
8 hours-post treatment initiation. Strikingly, starting from

failed to appreciably improve the anti-tumor activity of
selinexor (Supplementary Figure S9).
The anti-tumor activity of selinexor was further
investigated in STO cells orthotopically xenotransplanted
into SCID mice. Twenty-five days after cells i.p.
injection (i.e., 24 hours after the last treatment), mice
were euthanized and tumors were removed. At necropsy,
control (vehicle-treated) mice showed a large tumor mass
at the site of cell injection mainly invading the peritoneum
wall, and widespread small nodules in the peritoneum and
attached to the diaphragm, liver and bowel (Figure 4C),
resulting in a tumor burden (average ± SD mg) of 328 ±
69 mg (Figure 4D). In selinexor-treated animals, the size
of the single residual tumor mass -which was adherent
to the peritoneum, in the site of cell injection- was
significantly reduced (88 ± 21 mg) compared to control
mice (Figure 4D, 4E and Table 2). In addition, TUNEL and
survivin immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections
obtained from orthotopic xenografts revealed increased
apoptosis and reduced survivin expression at both nuclear
and cytoplasmic cellular compartments (Figure 4F) in
selinexor-treated compared to control mice. These results
were further corroborated by Western blot analysis
performed on frozen tumor samples (Figure 4G).
SINE were well tolerated, with no toxic deaths
and minimal weight loss (<5%). In addition, no gross
pathology was observed at necropsy carried out at the end
of each experiment.
Taken together our findings suggest that the reduced
expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin is a major
mechanism by which SINE exert their anti-tumor activity
and provide a rationale basis for offering treatment of
DMPM with SINE.

Oral SINE show anti-tumor activity in
DMPM xenografts
We next examined the in vivo anti-tumor activity of
oral administration of SINE in DMPM xenografts. In vivo
activity of KPT-251, KPT-276 and selinexor was initially
tested against early-stage subcutaneous STO xenografts in
nude mice. A remarkable and superimposable anti-tumor
effect was observed after treatment with the different
agents (Figure 4A and Table 2), and a stabilization of
tumor volume was appreciable up to 2 weeks post drug
withdrawal (Figure 4A). Although to a lesser extent
compared to early-stage tumors, the clinically available
compound selinexor produced a significant tumor growth
inhibition even in late-stage STO tumors (Figure 4A and
Table 2). In addition, selinexor significantly inhibited the
growth of both early- and late-stage subcutaneous MesoII
tumors (Figure 4B and Table 2). Strikingly, in late-stage
STO and MesoII tumors, the growth was dramatically
slowed at the beginning of the treatment, and tumor
volumes kept almost constant during the course of drug
administration (Figure 4B).
Given the strong in vitro synergistic activity of the
selinexor/YM155 combination, we explored whether
this effect was also appreciable in vivo. However, results
obtained in early-stage STO tumors revealed that YM155

DISCUSSION

the nuclear export protein family have been identified
(XPO2-7), XPO1/CRM1 is the sole nuclear exporter
for some of the major tumor suppressors (i.e., p53), cell
cycle regulators (i.e., CDKN1a) and growth promoting
proteins (i.e., survivin) [9–11]. TP53 is one of the most
frequently mutated genes in human cancers [41]. In this
context, it has been shown that XPO1/CRM1 is able to
export not only wild-type p53 but also mutant proteins
which carry mutations in regions other than NES [42].
Specifically, the p53 NES lies within a highly conserved
region in the C-terminal tetramerization domain (which is
between the first and second of three nuclear localization
signals spanning amino acids 316–325, 369–375 and
379–384 [43]), and only mutations of residues in this
region prevent p53 XPO1/CRM1-mediated export [42].
In this study, we focused on two DMPM models, STO and
MesoII, bearing wild-type and mutant p53, respectively.
Notably, in both cell models, the p53 becomes trapped in
the nucleus following SINE-mediated inhibition of XPO1/
CRM1, since p53 mutations in MesoII cells do not occur
in the NES.
We previously reported that survivin -as well as
other members of the IAP family- is largely overexpressed
in clinical DMPM [6], possibly contributing to its inherent
chemoresistance, and suggested that strategies aimed at
down-regulating survivin may provide a novel approach
for the treatment of DMPM. Indeed, we found that siRNAmediated survivin knockdown in DMPM cells significantly
reduced their proliferative potential and enhanced both
spontaneous and cisplatin- and doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis. Based on this evidence highlighting a possible
important function of survivin in sustaining DMPM cell
growth, we explored the role of the anti-apoptotic protein
as a determinant of SINE anticancer activity.
Exposure to single SINE compounds, KPT-251,
KPT-276 or selinexor, induced a time- and dose-dependent
inhibition of growth of the two DMPM cell lines without

DMPM is inherently resistant to chemotherapy,
which is considered a palliative treatment for patients
who are not eligible for radical surgery. Currently, there is
no standard systemic chemotherapy and no drug officially
approved for the disease [2–4]. A limited knowledge on
the dysregulated molecular pathways in DMPM, that could
be specifically modulated to obtain a direct therapeutic
effect or to increase the tumor sensitivity to conventional
anticancer agents, also prevented the use of targeted
therapeutic approaches in the clinical management of
DMPM patients. These reasons underline the urgent need
for new and more effective therapies for DMPM.
Based on the notion that mislocalization of proteins,
which highly affect their functions, is a common feature in
cancer [31], the regulation of protein trafficking between
the nucleus and cytoplasm has been recently regarded as
a novel control point for therapeutic interventions [32].
Clinical trials using leptomycin B, which specifically
binds and block XPO1/CRM1 [33], proved to be too toxic
for patients [34]. However, novel, rationally designed
small molecules that form a slowly reversible covalent
bond in the cargo-NES binding domain of XPO1/CRM1,
i.e. SINE, (12–14) have been recently developed. In this
study we demonstrated that SINE induce anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic effects in DMPM cell lines and,
most importantly, significantly inhibit the growth of
subcutaneous and orthotopic DMPM xenografts at welltolerated doses.
XPO1/CRM1 has been reported to have an
increased expression in several tumor types [12, 25,
26, 35–40]. In this context, gene expression profiling
analysis on clinical DMPM and normal peritoneum
samples (unpublished data) showed significantly higher
XPO1/CRM1 mRNA levels in tumors (Supplementary
Figure S10). Interestingly, though six other members of

affecting normal cell proliferation. Such a cell growth
inhibition was preceded by a decline in nuclear XPO1/
CRM1 levels and an increase in nuclear accumulation of
its cargo proteins p53 (in both cell lines) and CDKN1a
(in STO cells only). These results were consistent with
previous observations in cell lines from other human
tumor types [12, 17, 20, 24–26, 28]. Here we show that
survivin is an essential component in DMPM cell response
to SINE-mediated XPO1/CRM1 inhibition. In fact, in
both cell lines, exposure to SINE led to a time-dependent
reduction of cytoplasmic survivin levels and, after an
initial survivin nuclear accumulation, also to a progressive
decrease in the nuclear protein abundance, through the
ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway, ultimately
leading to the complete depletion of total survivin levels.
Conversely to what was reported in TNBC cells, in
which exposure to SINE repress survivin transcription by
inhibiting CREB-binding mediated STAT3 acetylation and
blocking STAT3 binding to the survivin promoter [22], in
DMPM cell models SINE compounds failed to interfere
with STAT3 acetylation status and to modulate survivin
mRNA expression, suggesting that drug-induced effect on
transcription could be cell-context dependent.
In both DMPM cell models, drug-induced reduction
of cytoplasmic survivin levels correlated with the onset
of caspase-dependent apoptosis. We further observed that
SINE can be combined with other survivin inhibitors, such
as the survivin suppressant YM155 -which is currently
being tested in clinical trials (http://www.clinicaltrials
.gov) [7]- to achieve enhanced in vitro growth inhibition
in DMPM cells.
In vivo experiments with orally administered KPT251, KPT-276 or selinexor indicated that each compound
was able to significantly reduce the growth of early stage
subcutaneous STO xenografts. Interestingly, additional
experiments carried out with selinexor, the first-in-class
SINE currently being developed for clinical use in solid
and hematologic malignancies (http://clinical trials.
gov), demonstrated that the compound was also able to
inhibit the growth of late-stage subcutaneous STO and
MesoII xenografts in nude mice. Most importantly, oral
administration of selinexor to SCID mice reduced the
growth of orthotopic STO xenografts, which properly
recapitulate the dissemination pattern in the peritoneal
cavity of human DMPM and, for this reason, represent
a valuable model for investigating novel therapeutic
approaches for the disease. Consistent with an important
role of survivin as a determinant of anti-cancer activity of
SINE compounds, a reduction of the protein expression
was observed in tumor specimens obtained from selinexor
treated mice.
Overall, our preclinical data corroborate previous
evidence of an important anti-neoplastic activity of SINE
compounds in experimental models of many human solid
and hematologic malignancies [12, 13, 15–29] and form a
solid foundation that could promote the clinical translation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of SINE for the treatment of DMPM. In addition, survivin
down-regulation appears as a main mechanism of SINE
anti-cancer activity in DMPM experimental models,
suggesting the anti-apoptotic protein as a possible
biomarker for patient selection in the clinical setting.
In this context, preliminary data of activity of selinexor
from solid malignancy trials, together with the low
toxicity profile of this class of compounds [44] and their
synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer
agents, further support the clinical development, also in
combination regimens, of SINE against malignancies
that are highly refractory to current chemotherapies, such
as DMPM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs
For in vitro studies, KPT-251, KPT-276, selinexor
(provided by Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.), and
YM155 (purchased from Selleck Chemicals; #S1130)
were initially dissolved in DMSO, stored at –20°C, and
diluted in complete culture medium immediately before
use. For in vivo studies, KPT-251, KPT-276 and selinexor
were prepared as previously described [20]; YM155 was
dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline solution.

Cell lines
Human DMPM cell lines (STO and MesoII)
were established from surgical specimens of patients
who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS
Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan, as previously
described [6]. The normal human lung fibroblast (WI38)
and the normal adult human prostate (RWPE-1) cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; #CCL-75 and #CRL-11609). Cells
were maintained in the logarithmic growth phase as
a monolayer in DMEM F12 (STO and MesoII) and
DMEM (WI38) media (Lonza; #12-719F and #12-604F)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, or in K-SFM (RWPE-1; GIBCO; #17005-042),
in a humidified incubator at 37°C with a supply of 5%
CO2/95% air atmosphere. Cell lines are tested fortnightly
for the absence of Mycoplasma and periodically (every
six months) monitored for DNA profile of short tandem
repeats analysis by the AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR
amplification kit (Applied Biosystems; #4322288). All cell
lines were last tested in September 2014.

Cell growth inhibition assay and drug
interaction analysis
The antiproliferative activity of SINE, alone or in
combination with YM155, was determined by the CellTiter
96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
13128

Oncotarget

of a 50:50 protein A slurry. Tumor protein lysates were
obtained from frozen xenograft samples pulverized by the
Mikro-Dismembrator II (B. Brown Biotech International).
The antibodies used in the study were CDKN1a
(#ab7960), p53 (#ab26), ubiquitin (#ab7780), survivin
(#ab469), β-actin (#ab8227), TBP (#ab818) (Abcam Inc.),
STAT3 (#4904) and STAT3 Ac (#2523) (Cell Signaling
Technology). Western blot analysis was carried out as
detailed in Supplementary Material and Methods.

(MTS; Promega; #G3580), as detailed in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Concentrations able to inhibit cell
growth by 50% (IC50) and 80% (IC80) were determined
graphically from the dose-response curves obtained after
a 72-hour exposure of cells to SINE.
The nature of the interaction between YM155 and
SINE was evaluated according to the method described
by Chou and Talalay [45] using the CalcuSyn software
(Biosoft). Specifically, combination index (CI) values
<1 or >1 indicate synergy or antagonism, respectively,
whereas a CI value of 1 indicates additivity. Such an
interaction was also determined according to the method
of Kern et al [46]. In brief, the expected cell survival
(Sexp, defined as the product of the survival observed
with selinexor alone and the survival observed with
YM155 alone) and the observed cell survival (Sobs) with
the selinexor/YM155 combination were used to construct
an index (R)=Sexp/Sobs. R indexes >1 or <1 indicate
synergism or antagonism, respectively, whereas R index
of 1 indicates additivity.

ELISA assay
Survivin protein was quantified in whole or nuclear/
cytosolic cell lysate obtained from cells exposed to SINE
in the presence or absence of subtoxic concentrations of
Bortezomib (1 nmol/L; Selleck Chemicals; #S1013) using
Surveyor™ IC Human Total Survivin Immunoassay (R&D
Systems; #SUV647) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Quantitative RT-PCR

Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis analysis

Total RNA (0.5 μg) isolated from DMPM cells
using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies; #15596-026)
was reverse transcribed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR
Core kit (Applied Biosystems; #N8080143) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of survivin
mRNA expression levels was assessed by quantitative RTPCR (qRT-PCR) as detailed in Supplementary Material
and Methods.

Both adherent and floating cells were fixed in 70%
EtOH and incubated at 4°C for 30 min in staining solution
containing 50 μg/mL of propidium iodide, 50 mg/mL of
RNase, and 0.05% Nonidet-P40 in PBS. Samples were
analyzed with a FACSCalibur cytofluorimeter (Becton
Dickinson). At least 30,000 events were read, and
histograms were analyzed using the CellQuest software
according to the Modfit model (Becton Dickinson).
Apoptosis was detected by using FITC Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection kit I (BD Pharmigen; #556547), as
detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods. In the
same cellular samples, the catalytic activity of caspase-3
was measured by means of the APOPCYTO/caspase-3 kit
(MBL International; #4815). Briefly, cells were washed,
pelleted, and lyzed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total protein and the specific fluorogenic
substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-pNA (DEVD-pNA)
were mixed for 1 hour at 37°C and transferred to 96-well
microtiter plates. The hydrolysis of the specific substrates
was monitored by a spectrofluorometer (POLARstar
OPTIMA) with 380-nm excitation and 460-nm emission
filters. Results were expressed as relative fluorescence
units (rfu).

In vivo experiments
In both DMPM models, treatment with KPT-SINE
started 4 days after tumors injection (early-stage tumors)
or when tumors were ~ 800 mm3 (late-stage tumors).
Drugs were delivered by oral gavage according to different
doses and schedule determined on the basis of preliminary
experiments aimed at defining the most active/less toxic
conditions (data not shown): KPT-251, 50 mg/kg twice
a week for 4 weeks (q3-4d/w × 8); KPT-276, 50 mg/kg 
5 days a week for 3 weeks (5d/w × 3w); selinexor, 10 mg/kg
q3-4d/w × 8. For combination experiments, four days
after cell injection, mice (8 mice/group) were randomized
to receive the drug vehicle or selinexor (p.o., 10 mg/kg,
q3-4d/w × 8) and YM155 (s.c., 4 mg/kg, 5d/w × 4w),
singly administered or in combination. Tumor growth was
followed by biweekly measurements of tumor diameters
with a Vernier calliper and tumor volume (TV) was
calculated according to the formula: TV (mm3) = d2xD/2,
where d and D are the shortest and the longest diameter,
respectively. The anti-tumor activity was assessed as TV
inhibition percentage (TVI%) in treated versus control
mice, calculated as follows: TVI% = 100-(mean TV
treated/mean TV control × 100).

Protein extraction and western blot analysis
Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were obtained from
DMPM cells using the nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit
(MBL International; #JM-K266). For the assessment of
the ubiquitinated form of survivin, nuclear extracts were
immunoprecipitated with the anti-survivin antibody
(Abcam Inc.; #ab469) for 16 hours at 4°C by addition

CONFLICTs OF INTEREST

Orthotopic model was generated by injecting
107 exponentially growing STO cells suspended in 200 μl
saline in the peritoneum of SCID mice. The day after
cell injection, mice were randomized (9 mice/group) to
receive the drug vehicle or selinexor at 10 mg/kg by oral
gavage q3-4d/w × 8. Twenty-five days after cell injection
(i.e. 24 hours after the last drug treatment) mice were
sacrificed and the tumor masses present in the peritoneum
were removed and weighted. The tumor weight inhibition
percentage (TWI%) was used to assess the anti-tumor
activity of selinexor. Drug treatment toxicity was
determined as body weight loss and lethal toxicity. Deaths
occurring in treated mice before the death of the first
control mouse were ascribed to toxic effects.
At the end of each experiment, tumor specimens
were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for subsequent
histological and immunohistochemical analysis or flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analysis.
The origin of subcutaneous and orthotopic
xenografts was authenticated through microsatellite
analysis by the AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR Amplification
Kit (Applied Biosystems).
