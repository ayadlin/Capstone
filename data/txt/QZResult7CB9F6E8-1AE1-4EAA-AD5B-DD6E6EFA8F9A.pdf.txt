Chemotherapy or Hypoxia

Abstract
Intratumoral heterogeneity helps drive the selection for
diverse therapy-resistant cell populations. In this study, we
demonstrate the coexistence of two therapy-resistant populations with distinct properties that are reproducibly enriched
under conditions that characterize tumor pathophysiology.
Breast cancer cells that survived chemotherapy or hypoxia were
enriched for cells expressing the major hyaluronic acid receptor
CD44. However, only CD44hi cells that survived chemotherapy
exhibited cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotypes based on growth
potential and gene expression signatures that represent oncogenic signaling and metastatic prowess. Strikingly, we identiﬁed
TGFb2 as a key growth promoter of CD44hi cells that survived

chemotherapy but also as a growth inhibitor of cells that
survived hypoxia. Expression of the TGFb receptor TGFbR1
and its effector molecule SMAD4 was required for enrichment
of CD44hi cells exposed to the chemotherapeutic drug epirubicin, which suggests a feed-forward loop to enrich for and
enhance the function of surviving CSCs. Our results reveal
context-dependent effects of TGFb2 signaling in the same
tumor at the same time. The emergence of distinct resistant
tumor cell populations as a consequence of prior therapeutic
intervention or microenvironmental cues has signiﬁcant implications for the responsiveness of recurring tumors to therapy.

Introduction

example after antiangiogenic therapy (8, 9). Recent studies have
elucidated the coexistence of distinct CSC phenotypic states (10),
though the factors that direct cells towards one state versus the
other are not known.
Expression of the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44 is signiﬁcantly
enriched on CSCs in many tumor types (5, 11, 12). The tumorforming capacity of cells isolated from breast tumors is deﬁned in
part by CD44 expression (11), and in breast cancer patients, the
expression of CD44 in the tumor correlates with poor prognosis
(13, 14). In addition to its utility as a cell surface marker for CSCs,
CD44 directly affects tumor progression, cell proliferation, and
extracellular matrix organization (12, 15). CD44 knockdown was
previously shown to inhibit invasion, spheroid formation, and
tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 cells (16) and promote differentiation of primary breast cancer cells (17).
TGFb has been implicated in CSC survival after chemotherapy
and in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process
that has been associated with metastasis and CSCs (18, 19). More
generally, TGFb signaling exerts pleiotropic and context-dependent effects on cancer cell growth. For example, TGFb promotes
cytostasis in normal mammary epithelial cells (20), and conversely the same signal promotes cell proliferation in late breast
cancer (21). While the mechanisms that distinguish the pleiotropic effects of the signaling are not fully understood, the downstream effects of TGFb can be modulated by many factors,
including signals from the microenvironment, other oncogenic
signaling pathways, and the expression of SMAD-binding coactivators and corepressors.
Here we identify conditions that reproducibly enrich for CSClike populations that exhibit opposite responses to TGFb signals.
TGFb promotes the regrowth of breast cancer cells after cytotoxic
chemotherapy yet inhibits their regrowth after hypoxic stress.

Tumor cells that are resistant to therapy can fuel disease relapse
and thus constitute a major barrier to achieving sustained clinical
responses. Resistance is generally classiﬁed as intrinsic or developed and can be mediated by several mechanisms. Moreover,
intratumoral heterogeneity may generate a diversity of resistance
mechanisms that coexist within the same tumor. Sources of this
heterogeneity include genetic and epigenetic changes, cellular
plasticity, tumor microenvironment factors such as hypoxia,
immune cell inﬁltration, exposure to therapeutic compounds,
and stochastic changes in signal transduction and gene expression
(1–4).
The cancer stem cell (CSC) model provides a mechanistic basis
for intratumoral heterogeneity based on measurable phenotypes
and thus constitutes a useful framework for studying therapeutic
resistance. CSCs comprise the malignant subpopulation of cells in
a tumor that drive tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse (5, 6).
CSCs can be resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapies (1, 7) and have
also been observed adjacent to hypoxic regions of tumors, for

Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of TGFb signaling elicits the
opposite pattern of responses in the two cell populations. As
hypoxic regions of the tumor may not be accessible to chemotherapy, the distinct populations described here could coexist in
tumors, with implications for successful long-term treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
SKBR3 and MCF7 cells were authenticated by short tandem
repeat analysis. SKBR3 cells were maintained in McCoy 5A Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin.
MCF7 cells were maintained in Eagle Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.01 mg/mL insulin, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate. For FACS experiments, SKBR3 were treated with 60 to 90 nmol/L epirubicin and
MCF7 cells were treated with 150 to 200 nmol/L, approximately
IC30–IC50. For hypoxia experiments, cells were grown in 1% O2
for 5 to 7 days. CD44 activity was stimulated with hyaluronic acid
(HA) polymers of either 50 K or 1000 K size (Sigma) by adding
200 mg/mL to three-dimensional (3D) cultures. CD44–HA interaction was blocked using the 5F12 antibody (Thermo Scientiﬁc) at
10–25 mg/mL. To examine TGFb activity, cells were treated with 25
ng/mL TGFb2 or 1 to 2 mmol/L SB431542 (R&D Systems). Cells in
3D growth assays were treated by adding growth factor, HA, or
drug to both Matrigel and media.
RNAi-mediated knockdown
Cells were transduced with lentiviral particles containing speciﬁc shRNAs directed against CD44 or TGFbR1 (Sigma). Stably
transduced cells were selected and grown in 2 mg/mL puromycin.
SMAD4 siRNAs were transfected with Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Sequences are provided in Supplementary Data.
Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested using CellStripper nonenzymatic cell
dissociation buffer (Mediatech) and resuspended in PBS with
3% BSA. Direct staining was performed for 30 minutes on ice, and
CD44 was detected with a FITC-labeled G44-26 antibody (BD
Biosciences). ALDH activity was determined by incubating cells
with Aldeﬂuor reagent (Stem Cell Technologies) according to
manufacturer's protocol for 1 hour at 37 C. Analysis was performed using a BD FACSCalibur, and sorting was performed using
a BD FACSAria 3. Live, CD44hi, and CD44/lo or Aldeﬂuorhi and
Aldeﬂuor/lo cells were isolated, spun at 1,000  g for 10 minutes
and resuspended in media for subsequent analysis and 3D growth
assays.
PCR
RNA (triplicate samples per condition) was isolated using an
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was generated using Superscript VILO RT (Life Technologies). qPCR was performed using
TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Life Technologies) and speciﬁc primer-probe sets for total CD44, CD44v8-10, VEGF,
TGFbR1, and TGFb-2 (provided in Supplementary Information).
Values reported are mean  SEM for at least three replicates.
Clonal growth assay
SKBR3 cells were embedded in Matrigel (Corning) at 1,000 cells
per well (unsorted) or 3,500 to 5,000 cells per well (sorted), while
MCF7 cells were embedded in reduced growth factor Matrigel

4606 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

(Corning) at 1,000 cells per well and n  3 for each condition.
Cells in Matrigel were overlaid with Mammocult medium (Stem
Cell Technologies). Colonies were counted at 7 days for untreated
and 7 to 14 days after epirubicin or hypoxia. Representative
pictures of complete wells were taken using a GelCount instrument (Oxford Optronix) and individual colonies were taken at
20 on an Olympus IX51 microscope. Values reported are mean
 SEM for at least three replicates within each experiment. Each
result was reproduced in multiple independent biologic experiments. Signiﬁcance was tested using a two-tailed Student t test
assuming unequal variance. Matrigel was used because without
it, SKBR3 mammospheres exhibited a high degree of aggregation,
especially after epirubicin, and thus were difﬁcult to quantify.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed with MPER (Pierce) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 minutes on ice and lysates
were clariﬁed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000  g.
Twenty-ﬁve to 50 mg of lysates were loaded onto 4%–12%
SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane. Western
blots were performed using GAPDH (Sigma), CD44 (Millipore),
and TGFbR1 (Life Technologies). Proteins were visualized using
DyLight-conjugated secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher) and
the LI-COR Odyssey scanner.
Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining
Senescence was detected using the b-galactosidase staining kit
from Clontech. SKBR3 cells (250,000) were seeded in 6-well
plates, treated with epirubicin or placed in hypoxia, and stained
using X-gal reagent overnight according to Clontech protocol.
Representative pictures were taken at 20 on an Olympus IX51
microscope, and results were quantitated by counting stained
and total cells in each picture. Values reported are mean  SEM
for at least three replicates within each experiment. Each result
was reproduced in multiple independent biologic experiments.
Microarray analysis
RNA from sorted cells was isolated using the RNEasy Kit
(Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed using the Ovation Pico
WTA System (NuGEN) and Ribo-SPIA technique. Ovation Pico
WTA products were fragmented and biotin labeled using the
Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN). For each sample, 5 mg of
biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to Human Genome U133
þ 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix) using buffers and conditions recommended by manufacturer. GeneChips were then
washed and stained with Streptavidin R-Phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes) using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, and scanned
with a Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000. Gene expression data
were processed by Micro Array Suite 5.0 (MAS5) algorithm. Probe
sets were ﬁltered to obtain robustly expressed qualiﬁers [average
signal value of  50, 100% present call (based on MAS5) in any of
the sample group]. Microarray data were deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession #GSE72362). Gene Set
Enrichment analysis was conducted using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software (Broad Institute; ref. 22).
Master regulator analysis
We interrogated context-speciﬁc regulatory or signaling networks and applied a network-based systems biology approach,
the master regulator inference algorithm (23, 24) to identify key
transcriptional or signaling master regulators associated with

Resistant Cancer Cells with Opposite Responses to TGFb

CD44hi cell populations induced by chemotherapy or hypoxia.
We used a data-driven approach, the ARACNe algorithm (25), to
reconstruct breast cancer–speciﬁc interactomes from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA; ref. 26) gene expression proﬁles in both
microarray (N ¼ 359) and RNASeq (N ¼ 950) platforms, against
800 transcription factors and 2,500 signaling proteins. The
parameters of ARACNe were conﬁgured as follows: P value
threshold P ¼ 1E7, DPI tolerance e ¼ 0, number of bootstraps
NB ¼ 100, and adaptive partitioning algorithm for mutual information estimation. For the GSEA method in the master regulator
inference algorithm, we applied "maxmean" statistic to score the
enrichment of the gene set and used sample permutation to build
the null distribution for statistical signiﬁcance. We used the Fisher
method to integrate master regulators predicted from microarrayor RNASeq-based TCGA breast cancer networks.

Results
Chemotherapy and hypoxia enrich for a CD44hi population
Cultured SKBR3 breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts established from them exhibit low expression of CD44, but when
tumor-bearing animals were treated with epirubicin, a cytotoxic
chemotherapy, the relapsed tumors exhibited high CD44 expression (27). To determine whether this observation could be
reproduced in vitro, which would enable mechanistic studies,
SKBR3 cells were treated with epirubicin for 3 days at the concentration that inhibited growth by 50% (IC50). Both the mRNA
and protein levels of CD44 increased after the treatment, as
revealed by immunoblot and qRT-PCR, respectively (Fig. 1A and
B). The same effect was observed when the cells were cultured for 5
to 9 days in hypoxia (1% O2), a stress that is common in untreated
tumors and also can be induced by antiangiogenic therapy (Fig.
1A and B). As drug perfusion through hypoxic regions can be
minimal (28), it is conceivable that chemotherapy and hypoxic
stress could simultaneously and differentially affect separate
regions of the same tumor.
CD44 mRNA was induced to a much greater extent in hypoxia
compared with chemotherapy (Fig. 1B). The induction of CD44
in hypoxia required 3 days, compared with 1 day for induction of
VEGF, and therefore CD44 does not appear to be a direct target
of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). As alternatively spliced variants of CD44 yield protein isoforms with different binding
speciﬁcities for extracellular matrix substrates, cell surface receptors, and other signaling molecules (29), we analyzed the variants
by RT-PCR after each treatment with exon-speciﬁc primers (30).
CD44S and CD44v8-10 were similarly induced in epirubicin and
hypoxia compared with untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Flow cytometry was used to distinguish between two scenarios:
induction of CD44 expression in all of the cells or enrichment of
the CD44hi population. Treatment with epirubicin or incubation
in hypoxia enriched for CD44hi cells as deﬁned by CD44 cell
surface expression (Fig. 1C); moreover, treatment with paclitaxel
had a similar effect (data not shown). The enrichment persisted
long after each treatment: after one week in normal conditions,
the fraction of CD44hi cells had increased further, and after 2
weeks, the fraction remained elevated in the epirubicin-treated
culture and returned to its post-treatment level in the hypoxiatreated culture (Fig. 1D and E). Thus the observed enrichments of
CD44hi do not reﬂect transient or readily reversible processes.
Despite these changes in CD44 expression, we did not observe any
decrease in the expression of CD24 (Supplementary Fig. S1B),

www.aacrjournals.org

another marker used in analysis of breast CSC populations and
commonly used in combination with CD44. The expression of
CD44 alone has been sufﬁcient for isolation of CSC populations
(11).
Several experiments were performed to study the mechanism
that underlies the enrichment of CD44hi cells. Annexin V staining
revealed that the apoptotic population in both treatments contained both CD44hi and CD44/lo cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C),
which suggested that the enrichment was not merely the result of
cell death that was restricted to CD44/lo cells. Because CD44
expression can be induced in senescent ﬁbroblasts (31), we
examined whether chemotherapy and hypoxia induce senescence
in this model. Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining
revealed an increased number of senescent cells after epirubicin
treatment compared with hypoxia (Fig. 1F and G). This result
indicated that epirubicin could induce a quiescent state in cells
and also suggested unique mechanisms of survival that gave rise
to the CD44hi population in each condition.
CD44 is required for clonal growth of SKBR3 breast cancer cells
The above results suggested that CD44 could be an important
determinant of therapeutic resistance in SKBR3 breast cancer cells.
To determine whether CD44 was required for growth, expression
of CD44 was reduced by shRNA technology (Fig. 2A). The clonal
growth of SKBR3 in Matrigel was dramatically inhibited in the
absence of CD44: colony number was reduced by at least 80%
with each of two independent CD44 shRNA constructs relative
to nontargeting shRNA (Fig. 2B). On tissue culture plastic, CD44
knockdown did not have an observable impact on cell growth at
normal passaging density and had a modest effect on clonogenic
growth, which might reﬂect the interaction of CD44 with extracellular matrix (32).
To further explore the function of the extracellular matrix in the
observed phenotype, we investigated the effect of hyaluronic acid
(HA), the primary ligand of CD44. HA increased the cell growth of
SKBR3 but did not restore colony formation of CD44 knockdown
cells (Fig. 2C), conﬁrming the CD44-based mechanism of the
effect. Conversely, the addition of an antibody (clone 5F12) that
blocks the interaction of CD44 with HA inhibited HA-stimulated
cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). As the knockdown of CD44 had a greater effect on cell growth than 5F12
treatment, it is likely that functions of CD44 in addition to HAbased signaling are required for cell growth. Together, these data
demonstrate key functions of CD44 in SKBR3 cells, a ﬁnding
consistent with results in other cell lines as well as the prognostic
signiﬁcance of CD44 in breast cancer (11, 13, 16).
The CSC phenotype of CD44hi cells depends on the treatment
history
CSC populations have been enriched following chemotherapy
treatment (1, 7) as well as hypoxia that results from rapid tumor
growth or antiangiogenic treatment (9, 33). To determine whether
the SKBR3 CD44hi cells that survived these treatments exhibited
CSC phenotypes, viable CD44hi and CD44/lo populations were
isolated by FACS and then immediately counted and seeded in
growth assays (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). qRT-PCR
conﬁrmed higher CD44 mRNA levels in the sorted CD44hi cells,
consistent with the cell surface expression (Supplementary Fig.
S2B and S2C).
Of the cells that survived epirubicin, CD44hi cells readily
formed colonies, while CD44/lo cells rarely formed colonies

concentrations of epirubicin (Fig. 3C). In sharp contrast, of the
cells that survived hypoxic stress, the CD44hi and CD44/lo
populations exhibited comparable growth (Fig. 3B and D); the
same results were obtained at the extreme near-anoxic oxygen

clonogenic potentials of CD44hi and CD44/lo (data not

cin-treated and hypoxia-treated cultures exhibited similar
colony morphology (Supplementary Fig. S2D), which enabled
a direct comparison of colony number. Colonies that grew
from cells sorted after chemotherapy and hypoxia were comprised predominantly of CD44/lo cells regardless of CD44
expression at the time of sorting (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Overall, our results demonstrated a striking phenotypic difference in CD44hi populations following two treatments and
suggested that epirubicin, but not hypoxia, was enriching for
CD44hi-marked CSCs.

We hypothesized that SKBR3 cells that survive epirubicin versus
hypoxia would exhibit differential responses to salinomycin, a
Wnt pathway modulator that selectively inhibited growth of
CD44hi breast CSCs (7). Indeed, salinomycin suppressed the
enrichment of CD44hi in epirubicin but not in hypoxia (Fig.
3E). Thus, three different phenotypes of CD44hi cells that survive
epirubicin versus hypoxia, mechanism of enrichment, growth
potential, and response to salinomycin, together indicated that
surprisingly, CD44hi enriches for CSC-like cells in epirubicin but
not hypoxia.
Unique transcriptional proﬁles of epirubicin-surviving CD44hi
cells
To identify mechanisms that could explain the treatmentdependent phenotype of CD44hi cells, transcriptional proﬁles
were generated for sorted CD44hi and CD44/lo cells after
each treatment. The comparison of two populations from the
same culture provides a uniquely controlled basis for analysis.
Replicate samples from four independent experiments clustered together (Fig. 4A). On the basis of the CSC phenotypes
speciﬁcally observed for CD44hi cells after epirubicin, it
was initially surprising that hypoxia induced the transcription of a substantially larger number of genes in CD44hi
versus CD44/lo compared with epirubicin (Fig. 4B). However, function-based analyses of the transcriptional proﬁles
revealed that epirubicin CD44hi cells exhibited a response
more reﬂective of tumor progression, consistent with their
CSC phenotypes.

www.aacrjournals.org

GSEA revealed that more transcriptional signatures were
enriched in CD44hi versus CD44/lo after epirubicin than in
hypoxia (Fig. 4C). CD44hi cells that survived epirubicin exhibited
broader enrichment for signatures related to stem cells, EMT,
metastasis, Wnt signaling, cancer progression, and oncogenic
signaling (Supplementary Table S1), consistent with the
CD44hi CSC phenotype after epirubicin but not hypoxia. Notably,
multiple gene sets related to b-catenin (CTNNB1), a key transducer of Wnt signaling, were observed exclusively after epirubicin
treatment (Supplementary Table S1). There was also substantial
overlap in the gene sets enriched by both treatments, and these
shared sets are indicative of aggressive cancer growth and less
differentiated tumors, as well as genes associated with cell adhesion and motility, which might be connected to the function of
CD44.
CD44hi cells that survived both treatments were enriched for
genes in the TGFb pathway (Supplementary Table S1). The ligand
TGFb2 was upregulated in CD44hi cells following both chemotherapy and hypoxia, as indicated by several microarray probes
and conﬁrmed by RT-PCR; the mRNA levels of TGFb2, like CD44,
were induced to a greater extent by hypoxia than epirubicin,
but the CD44hi/CD44/lo ratios were comparable (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Interestingly, endoglin, a coreceptor that
regulates TGFbR1/R2 activity, was downregulated after hypoxia
but maintained in epirubicin (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
As a complement to GSEA, we performed an analysis of gene
regulatory networks to identify master regulators that may have
implemented the observed transcriptional changes in CD44hi

versus CD44/lo. Master regulators include transcription factors
as well as upstream signaling factors and are deﬁned by interactomes that were reconstructed from datasets in TCGA (25,
26). There were more unique master regulators in CD44hi
versus CD44/lo cells after epirubicin compared with hypoxia
(Fig. 4D, Supplementary Table S2), similar to the ﬁnding in
GSEA. Interestingly, two master regulators related to Wnt sig-

naling were only identiﬁed in epirubicin: Wnt5A (FDR ¼ 0.01)
and CITED1 (FDR ¼ 0.009). CITED1 interacts with p300/CBP
and SMAD4 to promote transcription in response to TGFb and
also plays a role in Wnt-mediated gene expression (34, 35).
These epirubicin-speciﬁc master regulators are noteworthy in
light of the salinomycin effect and b-catenin signatures that
were also speciﬁc to epirubicin.

TGFb exerts opposing effects on cells that survive epirubicin
or hypoxia
The enrichment of TGFb signaling factors in CD44hi cells was
provocative in light of the documented interaction between CD44
and TGFbR1 to promote cell growth (36) and role of TGFb
signaling in CD44hi breast CSCs (37). We hypothesized that TGFb
signaling modulated the growth of the cells that survived epirubicin and hypoxia. To evaluate the effect of TGFb on the growth
of cells that survived the two treatments, sorted cells were supplemented with recombinant TGFb2 ligand. Strikingly, TGFb2
promoted the growth of CD44hi cells that survived epirubicin, yet
inhibited the growth of CD44hi (and CD44/lo) cells that survived
hypoxia (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
TGFb2 did not rescue the growth defects of CD44/lo cells that
survived epirubicin (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similar
effects were obtained with TGFb1 ligand (data not shown). Thus,
despite the upregulation of TGFb2 in both conditions, the ligand
exerted opposite effects on the cells based on their treatment
history.
In a complementary approach, TGFb signaling was modulated pharmacologically with the TGFbR inhibitor SB-431542
and the effect on cell growth was determined. SB-431542 is a
highly speciﬁc kinase inhibitor of type 1 TGFb receptors (38).
Consistent with the above results, SB-431542 inhibited the
growth of CD44hi cells that survived epirubicin and promoted

www.aacrjournals.org

the growth of CD44hi and CD44/lo cells that survived hypoxia
(Fig. 5C and D).
Because CD44 did not mark a CSC-speciﬁc population after
hypoxia, we examined whether another CSC marker deﬁned a
population that could regrow after exposure to low oxygen.
Alehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was previously identiﬁed as a marker of breast CSCs by staining cells with Aldeﬂuor (39,
40), and cells that exhibit this activity have also been identiﬁed in
hypoxic regions of breast tumors (33). Unlike CD44, there was no
enrichment in Aldeﬂuorhi cells in response to epirubicin or
hypoxia; moreover, the CD44hi and Aldeﬂuorhi populations had
minimal overlap (Supplementary Fig. S4C). However, of the cells
that survived hypoxia, Aldeﬂuorhi signal highly enriched for
clonal growth (Fig. 5E), which indicated that this activity enriched
for a CSC-like population in this context. After hypoxia,
Aldeﬂuorhi cells responded to TGFb2 treatment in the same way
as CD44hi and CD44/lo cells: TGFb2 inhibited colony formation
(Fig. 5E). The effect of TGFb on cells that survive hypoxia was thus
independent of CD44. Conversely, the effect of TGFb on cells that
survive epirubicin was dependent on CD44: it was observed in
CD44hi but not CD44lo or Aldeﬂuor-sorted cells (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S4D).
To determine whether the treatment-dependent effects of
TGFb in SKBR3 were also observed in other breast cancer cell
lines, we performed similar experiments with MCF7 cells,

which are ER-positive, HER2-negative, and represent a different
subtype of breast cancer than HER2-positive SKBR3. Consistent
with the results in SKBR3, TGFb2 promoted the growth of
MCF7 CD44hi cells that survived epirubicin and inhibited the
growth of CD44hi cells that survived hypoxia (Fig. 5F and G and
Supplementary Fig. S5). These data extended a key ﬁnding of
this study to another breast cancer cell line and suggested that
our conclusions may apply broadly across breast cancer. In
addition, although the HER2 oncogene is ampliﬁed in SKBR3
and has been shown to cooperate with TGFb (41, 42), the
MCF7 results suggest that the HER2–TGFb interaction is unlikely to be relevant in this context.
CSC enrichment in epirubicin is dependent on TGFb signaling
On the basis of the above results and cited literature (36, 37),
we hypothesized a direct mechanistic link between TGFb signaling and the CD44hi CSC phenotype in epirubicin. To determine
whether TGFb signaling was required for the enrichment, we
reduced TGFbR1 expression in SKBR3 cells by shRNA and then

www.aacrjournals.org

exposed them to epirubicin or hypoxia. Strikingly, the enrichment
of CD44hi cells in epirubicin was prevented by TGFbR1 knockdown, while the enrichment in hypoxia was not (Fig. 6A and B).
To establish whether the TGFb-mediated enrichment of CD44hi
cells in epirubicin occurs at the transcriptional level, we knocked
down the expression of SMAD4, a key transcriptional effector
of TGFb signaling, and exposed the cells to epirubicin. The reduction of SMAD4 levels prevented the enrichment of CD44hi
CSCs (Fig. 6C). In addition, we measured CD44 mRNA levels
in the TGFbR1 knockdown cells and observed that CD44 levels
were reduced (Fig. 6D). These results demonstrate SMAD-dependent transcriptional activation downstream of TGFb engagement to enrich the CSC phenotype in epirubicin.
On the basis of these results we hypothesized that inhibition of
CD44 or TGFb signaling would sensitize SKBR3 cells to chemotherapy. To test this, cells with stable shRNA knockdown of CD44
or TGFbR1 were exposed to various concentrations of epirubicin
for 24 hours and then allowed to form colonies. Indeed, SKBR3
cells with stable knockdown of CD44 or TGFbR1 exhibited

reduced growth after epirubicin treatment relative to the control
(Fig. 6E). Similarly, TGFb inhibition increased the radiosensitivity
of MCF7 and other breast cancer cells (43), which is likely due to
the same mechanism as both epirubicin and radiation generate
DNA damage. Notably, CD44 knockdown in SKBR3 did not
modulate sensitivity to epirubicin in a cell proliferation assay
(data not shown), which suggests that the clonogenic effect is
driven by cell survival. The experiments could not be performed in
Matrigel as CD44 knockdown inhibits growth in this condition
(Fig. 2B). Together, these data demonstrate that TGFb signaling
is involved in the earliest response to chemotherapy and suggest a
feedback loop in which, under certain conditions, TGFb signaling
induces CD44 expression and enriches the CSC phenotype, and
then CD44 modulates the effect of TGFb signals.

Discussion
Resistance to anticancer therapies is driven by a vast array of
mechanisms and can vary across tumor types and patient
populations. Our study has demonstrated the coexistence in
the same tumor of resistant cells with opposite responses to
TGFb signals, and thus has revealed a novel layer of complexity
of the TGFb pathway in breast cancer. One interpretation of the
data is that different cell populations in a tumor can exhibit
early- or late-stage characteristics based on microenvironment,
cellular history, or other factors. For example, cells exposed to
chemotherapy may interpret TGFb signals as progrowth, consistent with late-stage disease, while cells under hypoxic stress
may interpret TGFb signals as growth-suppressive until the
region becomes vascularized.
This study has identiﬁed an unexpected duality of TGFb pathway modulation that builds upon and reﬁnes the previously
identiﬁed links between TGFb and breast CSCs (18, 37). We
document opposite effects of TGFb activity that are dependent
on a cell's previous treatment yet independent of CD44 expression
(Fig. 7); the data challenge the existing model of a general CD44–
TGFb functional interaction in breast CSCs as well as the assumption that all CD44hi breast cancer cells exhibit the same phenotypes. Importantly, the data provide the ﬁrst evidence that cells in
the same tumor can have opposite signaling activities in response
to TGFb modulation; this dichotomous response is mechanisti-

Dichotomy between TGFb signaling in

Among cells that survive

of CSCs, and TGFb promotes the

enrichment of CD44 cells in a SMADdependent manner and promotes
their growth during recovery. In

cally distinct from heterogeneous signaling that reﬂects varied
expression of a receptor. In addition, we document a role of TGFb
signaling, including SMAD4 dependence, in enriching for the
CD44hi CSC phenotype in chemotherapy. TGFb signaling may
enrich for the CSC phenotype by inducing senescence transiently
in epirubicin treatment (Fig. 1F and G), consistent with previously
characterized functions of TGFb (44). Thus, our study provides
one mechanistic basis for heterogeneity of CSC phenotypes and
markers and suggests a feed-forward loop in which, in certain
cellular contexts, TGFb promotes the enrichment of CD44hi CSC
phenotype and then CD44 functionally interacts with the TGFb
pathway to promote cell growth in recovery.
The TGFb pathway interacts with many pathways, and unique
drivers may inﬂuence the proliferative versus antiproliferative
effects of TGFb. Our results implicate a context-dependent interaction between CD44 and TGFb receptors, which builds on
previous observations (36). Phosphorylated SMADs could interact with distinct transcription factors after chemotherapy or
hypoxia; for example, we identiﬁed the transcription factor CITED1 as a master regulator in CD44hi cells that survived epirubicin
but not hypoxia. Signatures of b-catenin, which can interact with
SMAD proteins, were enriched in epirubicin but not hypoxia.
Together, TGFb and b-catenin could promote an EMT phenotype
and CSC-like growth. Both CITED1 and b-catenin illustrate the
possible interaction between TGFb and Wnt pathways in response
to chemotherapy. Signal modulation also could occur at the
receptor complex; for example, the reduced expression of TGFbR
coreceptor endoglin in cells that survived hypoxia but not epirubicin (Supplementary Fig. S3C) may favor the growth-inhibitory
effects of TGFb in hypoxia (45, 46). Interestingly, the cytokine IL8
was strongly induced in hypoxia but not epirubicin (Supplementary Fig. S3D), which could be explained by the potent angiogenic
properties of IL8, although IL8 was also implicated in paclitaxelinduced CSCs (18).
Our study builds on previous observations of multiple CSC
states in breast cancer (10) by revealing speciﬁc conditions that
enrich for CSC-like populations with distinct phenotypes. CD44
expression enriched these cells only after epirubicin, while Aldeﬂuor activity enriched them after hypoxia; in addition, the CSCs
exhibited opposite results to TGFb modulation. CD44hi cells that
survived epirubicin exhibited a gene expression proﬁle that

reﬂects EMT, consistent with CD44þ breast cancer patient samples
(10). Conversely, ALDH1 expression in patient samples correlated with a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and increased
proliferation (10). Our results suggest that CSC states and phenotypes may continually adapt to changes in the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic insults as well as cumulative genetic
changes.
This study, along with several others (40, 47), demonstrates
that in vitro mechanistic studies are a necessary complement to in
vivo tumor initiation studies in the characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity and CSC growth mechanisms. CD44hi cells
isolated from dissociated tissues cannot be distinguished by their
unique histories and phenotypes, and the characterization of
those cells as one population compromises efforts to understand
mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. In both breast cancer cell
lines that we analyzed, our data suggest that CD44hi cells isolated
from relapsed tumors would include subpopulations that exhibit
opposite responses to TGFb modulation, depending on their
exposure to chemotherapy or hypoxic microenvironment. In the
future, tumor cells that are genetically engineered to display their
individual history of DNA damage and exposure to hypoxia, for
example, with ﬂuorescent proteins, could be used to bridge in vitro
and in vivo analyses. Other parameters that could also be monitored include intracellular levels of metabolites and administered
compounds; the latter is relevant due to challenges of drug
delivery in solid tumors that can result in different exposures in
different regions of the tumor.
The characterization of the diversity of resistance mechanisms
that may coexist in a tumor will ultimately inform therapeutic
strategies to improve clinical outcome. Novel therapies or multidrug regimens that target resistant tumor cell populations may
be enabled by recent technological advances, such as nanoparti-

cles, that can enable the timed delivery of two different compounds (48). Our data have speciﬁc implications for the development of TGFb pathway modulators such as type 1 TGFb
receptor inhibitors (49, 50). In addition, our results suggest that
microenvironment-based biomarkers might be valuable complements to tumor cell–based biomarkers in optimizing the design of
therapeutic regimens.
