BACKGROUND: Recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) induces cellular cytotoxicity against leukemia blasts. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) in first complete remission (CR) may harbor minimal residual disease that is susceptible to rIL-2–activated effector cells. METHODS: In
the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 19808 study, patients with AML in first CR were randomly assigned after all planned
chemotherapy to receive a 90-day course of subcutaneously administered rIL-2 or no further therapy. The primary objective was to
compare disease-free survival (DFS) between the 2 treatment arms. A total of 534 patients achieved a CR, 214 of whom were

randomized. Six courses of low-dose daily rIL-2 were given for the expansion of cytotoxic effector cells, each followed by 3-day highdose boluses given to trigger cytotoxicity against minimal residual disease. RESULTS: On the protocol-specified intention-to-treat
analysis, the hazards ratio for DFS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.09; P 5.13); the 5-year DFS rate was 42% in the observation arm and 53% in the rIL-2 treatment arm. The hazards ratio for overall survival (OS) was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.23;
P 5.34); the 5-year OS rate was 58% for the observation arm and 63% for the rIL-2 treatment arm. Twenty-five of the 107 patients
randomized to treatment with rIL-2 either refused or were unable to initiate therapy and 30 patients did not complete their assigned
therapy. However, significant toxicities were not commonly observed. The trial design did not anticipate the difficulties patients would
encounter with protocol compliance. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of immunotherapy with rIL-2 administered after intensive postremission treatment was not assessed as planned because of unexpected refusals by patients and/or their physicians to comply with

INTRODUCTION
Recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) induces cytotoxicity
against tumor targets mediated by cytotoxic T cells and
natural killer (NK) cells.1,2 Responses have been described
in patients with recurrent and refractory acute myeloid
leukemia (AML).3,4 Prior studies of rIL-2 treatment alone
in patients with AML in first complete remission (CR)
have not demonstrated improvements in outcomes.5
Beginning in 1994, the Cancer and Leukemia
Group B (CALGB) initiated a series of trials in patients
with AML in first CR6-8 using doses and schedules of rIL2 that induce the expansion and cytotoxicity of NK cells
with acceptable toxicity.9 We hypothesized that immunotherapy would be most effective when administered at the
time of minimal residual disease. We now report outcomes from a randomization between rIL-2 and observation for patients in CR after the completion of all planned
postremission therapy on the CALGB (Alliance) 19808
trial. Patients were randomized after receiving either highdose cytarabine (HiDAC) consolidation or autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT),
depending on cytogenetic risk. The feasibility and safety
of treatment with rIL-2 after AHSCT has been previously
shown.10,11 The goal was to assess the impact of rIL-2
immunotherapy on disease-free survival (DFS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Previously untreated patients aged < 60 years with AML in
first CR were randomized between 2 treatment arms: rIL-2
and observation. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, therapy-related AML, or AML arising from a prior
myeloproliferative disorder or those with a history of bone
marrow-proven myelodysplastic syndrome of >3 months
were excluded. Each participant signed an Institutional
Review Board-approved protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines.
Induction and Postremission Therapy

The details of the CALGB 19808 study have been
described previously.12 Briefly, induction chemotherapy

consisted of daunorubicin, etoposide, and cytarabine,
with or without valspodar (PSC-833), an inhibitor of pglycoprotein. The first 302 patients were randomized to
treatment with or without valspodar.
Postremission therapy depended on cytogenetic
risk. Patients with core-binding factor AML (ie, those
patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22), or
t(16;16)(p13;q22)) received 3 courses of HiDAC.13
Those patients with non–core-binding factor AML
in CR received HiDAC with high-dose infusional etoposide followed by AHSCT as previously described.14,15 If
unable to undergo transplantation, patients received an alternative consolidation sequence consisting of HiDAC
with high-dose infusional etoposide followed by 2 courses
of HiDAC.16
rIL-2 Treatment Plan

The doses and schedule of rIL-2 were developed in the prior
phase 1/2 CALGB 9621 study.8 Patients were randomized
between rIL-2 and observation after recovery from postremission chemotherapy or AHSCT. A maximum of
120 days was permitted from day 1 of the final course of
consolidation chemotherapy or day 0 of AHSCT. The absolute neutrophil count had to be >0.75 3 109/L and the platelet count >10 3 109/L without transfusions. A bone
marrow biopsy documenting a leukemia-free state with trilineage hematopoiesis was required. Consent for the immunotherapy randomization was obtained at the time of
protocol registration, before induction therapy.
The 90 days of treatment with rIL-2 consisted of 6
courses of 10 to 16 days of low-dose rIL-2 (1 3 106 U/m2
subcutaneously [SC] daily) interspersed with five 3-day
high-dose courses (12 3 106 U/m2215 3 106 U/m2 SC
daily) (Fig. 1). The last low-dose sequence extended to 16
days to provide a total of 90 days of therapy. Low-dose rIL2 therapy was to be continued, with transfusion support as
needed to maintain a platelet count >10 3 109/L. If the
absolute neutrophil count was < 0.5 3 109/L, therapy was
held until recovery to >0.75 3 109/L, at which time rIL-2

Statistical Analysis

Figure 1. Treatment plan for recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)
maintenance therapy is shown. Low-dose rIL-2 was given subcutaneously (SC) for 10 to 16 days. Each low-dose sequence
was followed by 3 days of high-dose rIL-2 administered SC.
The course was completed with 16 days of low-dose rIL-2 therapy without further administration of high-dose rIL-2. Patients
were given a rest day after each high-dose sequence.

could be restarted with a 20% dose reduction. If transfusion requirements increased, or if incapacitating fatigue
developed or any nonhematologic toxicity of >grade 2
other than fever, a 3-day to 7- day therapy interruption was
prescribed, followed by up to 3 dose reductions to 0.8 3
106 U/m2, 0.6 3 106 U/m2, or 0.4 3 106 U/m2.
Patients without a >grade 2 toxicity other than
fever after the first 3-day high-dose sequence were to
have their dose of rIL-2 increased from 12 3 106 U/m2
to 15 3 106 U/m2 daily starting with the second highdose sequence. Patients experiencing >grade 2 nonhematologic toxicity after high-dose rIL-2 underwent dose
interruptions of 3 to 7 days, after which the previously
tolerated low dose of rIL-2 was given until the next highdose cycle. Up to 3 reductions of 3 3 106 U/m2 each
were allowed for patients who had been escalated to 15
3 106 U/m2 and 2 reductions were permitted for
patients who were not escalated above 12 3 106 U/m2.
Missed high-dose treatments were not made up.
Criteria for Response and Toxicity

National Cancer Institute Workshop criteria were used to
define CR.17 The National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria were used to grade toxicity.
Quality Control, Quality Assurance, and Auditing

Institutional Review Board approval was required for every participating institution with written informed consent obtained from each patient. Patient registration, data
collection, and all statistical analyses were performed by
the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and
Data Management Center. The medical records of 83
patients (39% of the 214 randomized patients) were audited; records from each participating institution were
reviewed. In addition, this study was monitored by the
CALGB (Alliance) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee following standard National Cancer Institute policies.
1012

Randomization on the current study used a randomized
permuted block design with a block size of 8 and a 1:1
allocation to the 2 treatments (rIL-2 or observation) with
stratification by the assigned induction regimen (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide [ADE] and cytarabine,
daunorubicin, etoposide, and valspodar [ADEP]) and
cytogenetic risk group (favorable or others). The randomization process was set up and maintained by the CALGB
(Alliance) Statistics and Data Management Center.
The primary endpoint was DFS from the date of the
immunotherapy randomization. The design assumed that
240 patients would achieve CR, complete all other treatment, and be randomized between rIL-2 and observation.
These patients would be followed until a total of 192 failures were observed, providing 90% power to detect a hazards ratio (HR) < 0.625 with respect to DFS. Analyses of
DFS and overall survival (OS) used 2-sided log-rank tests18
at the .05 significance level as well as proportional hazards
regression models.19 For the analysis of DFS, patients who
were alive and in CR were censored at the time of last
follow-up. OS was measured from the date of the immunotherapy randomization until the date of death; patients
alive at the time of last follow-up were censored. Protocolspecified interim analyses were performed every 6 months
after 100 patients were entered as previously described.20
The primary analyses compared the outcomes of
patients randomized to the rIL-2 treatment arm with
those who were randomized to the observation arm. Secondary analyses compared outcomes for patients who did
not receive any rIL-2 with those who received at least 1
dose of rIL-2. In addition, a landmark analysis21 was conducted to compare outcomes by the amount of rIL-2
received by day 120 after randomization. In these analyses, survival duration was defined as the time from the
landmark of 120 days to the event.
Survival estimates were calculated using the KaplanMeier method,22 and treatment groups were compared
using a 2-sided log-rank test at a significance level of .05.
Univariable Cox proportional hazards models were performed for both DFS and OS and the estimated HRs and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were
calculated to compare treatment groups within various
subgroups defined by clinical parameters. Forest plots23
were generated to summarize these results and to evaluate
any treatment covariate or subgroup effect.
RESULTS
Between November 15, 2000 and March 31, 2006, 734
patients were registered. A CR was achieved by 549 of the

716 evaluable patients (77%). After the completion of all
chemotherapy, 214 patients agreed to be randomized
between rIL-2 therapy and observation. Table 1 describes
the well-balanced demographic and clinical characteristics
of the randomization arms.
Of 549 patients who achieved a CR, 63 (11%) were
removed from protocol therapy to receive allogeneic
transplantation. Eighty-two patients (15%) refused randomization and 73 patients (13%) developed disease recurrence before randomization (Fig. 2) (Table 2). Among
the 107 patients assigned to receive rIL-2, 31 patients
(29%) did not begin treatment, almost all (25 patients)
because of patient refusal. Another 30 patients (28%) initiated treatment but failed to complete their 90-day
course. Reasons for discontinuing therapy included 19
patient refusals (18%) with grade 1 or grade 2 toxicity,
and 5 patient refusals (5%) with grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity; 6 patients (6%) developed disease recurrence while
receiving rIL-2. Seventy-six of the 107 patients assigned
to receive rIL-2 therapy (71%) received at least 1 dose of
rIL-2; 46 patients (43%) received at least 50% of the
planned therapy and 25 patients (23%) received at least
90% of the planned therapy.
Toxicity

Severe adverse events were uncommon. Grade 3 and 4
toxicities were observed in at least 5% of patients and are
shown in Table 2. Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, and hypotension were the most common grade 3
and 4 events and were readily reversible.

Figure 3. The HR for OS was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.54-1.23;
P 5 .34); the 5-year OS rate was 58% for the observation
arm and 63% for the rIL-2 treatment arm. In an exploratory “as-treated” analysis in which patients who were
randomized to receive rIL-2 therapy but who either did
not receive or refused their assigned treatment were combined with the 107 patients in the observation arm, outcomes among the 76 patients who received at least 1 dose
of rIL-2 were compared with the 138 patients who did
not receive any immunotherapy. The 5-year DFS rate was
43% in the no immunotherapy group (median, 1.7 years)
and 55% in the group treated with rIL-2 (median DFS
not reached; P 5 .11) (Fig. 4), whereas the 5-year OS rates
were 60% in the observation group and 61% in the group
treated with rIL-2; neither group had reached the median
OS at the time of last follow-up. An additional exploratory landmark analysis comparing outcomes by amount
of rIL-2 received by day 120 after randomization ( 50%
of the planned dose vs < 50% or no rIL-2 received) demonstrated similar trends with respect to DFS (P 5 .15
in both instances) (Fig. 5) and no difference with respect
to OS (P 5 .5). Univariable analyses for DFS and OS
using 9 variables demonstrated that only the European
LeukemiaNet genetic grouping24 significantly affected
DFS and OS, whereas the baseline lactate dehydrogenase
level was found to be significantly associated with OS
(data not shown). A forest plot analysis showed HRs
favoring rIL-2 with respect to DFS among all 16 variables
studied (Fig. 6) and OS in 13 of the 16 variables studied
(data not shown), but the 95% CI crossed unity in each
instance.

Outcomes

By the protocol-specified intention-to-treat analysis, the
HR for DFS was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.52-1.09; P 5 .13); the
5-year DFS rate was 42% for the observation arm
and 53% for the rIL-2 treatment arm. Details are given in

including preliminary data from the current report.5 Five
of the 6 cited trials were published between 2007 and
2010, well after the start of this study. One phase 3 trial

that combined rIL-2 with histamine dihydrochloride in
patients with AML in CR favored the rIL-2 arm.25
The CALGB has completed 2 phase 3 trials in older
and younger patients with AML in first CR that evaluated
the effect of the SC administration of rIL-2 on DFS.
CALGB 9720, which was performed in patients
aged  60 years, demonstrated no benefit for treatment
with rIL-2.7 Our results in CALGB 19808 among
patients aged < 60 years did not reach statistical significance with respect to DFS and OS.
This randomized immunotherapy maintenance trial
encountered constraints with respect to patient acceptance. Despite a lack of excessive toxicity, many patients
declined to receive their assigned immunotherapy either
after randomization or after experiencing modest toxicity.

with 49 of the 107 younger patients (46%). In a subsequent study, CALGB 10503, patients aged < 60 years
with AML received similar induction and consolidation
therapy as in the current study. Of 349 patients in first
CR, 34% received a planned phase 2 decitabine maintenance sequence after completing all postremission therapy.26 In both trials, the investigational therapy was given
after a prolonged course of intensive chemotherapy
including AHSCT or multiple cycles of HiDAC. We
speculate that “treatment fatigue” may be a reason contributing to the refusal of younger patients (15% in the
1015

Original Article

current study and 9% in CALGB 10503) to receive additional outpatient treatment after intensive postremission
therapy.26 Withdrawal from therapy in the absence of
quantifiable toxicity may be an important obstacle to drug
development. Consideration should be given to establishing feasibility measurements alongside toxicity scales as
new therapies are evaluated.
NK cells are a central component of the innate
immune response. CD56brightCD16dim/negative NK cells
expand at the time of interaction between low-dose rIL-2
and its high-affinity receptor. Short courses of rIL-2 at
higher doses can activate cytotoxicity against NK cellresistant tumor targets.20 These effects have been
described in vitro using concentrations of rIL-2 readily
achieved with SC dosing,27 as well as in patients with immunodeficiencies and malignancies.9,28 Significant
expansion of NK cells with cytolytic activity against autologous blasts was observed in a trial of continuous intravenous infusion low-dose rIL-2 after HiDAC consolidation
in younger patients with AML in first CR.29
The NK cell population that is expanded by lowdose rIL-2 expresses fewer inhibitory killer immunoglobulin receptors than CD56dim NK cells, whose cytotoxicity
is inhibited by the major histocompatibility complex class
I ligands present on target cells.30 Conversely, rIL-2 also
activates regulatory T cells (Tregs), which can dampen the
autologous antitumor immune response.31
The failure to reach statistical significance for DFS,
the primary endpoint, is consistent with the results of other
studies of IL-2 as reported in the recently published metaanalysis.5 Unfortunately, in the current study, the number
of patients randomized was far fewer than anticipated,
with a resultant decrease in power. The observed number
of events was only 60% of the planned number. Thus, the
power of this trial to detect the originally specified HR was
only 0.71, rather than the planned 0.90. Because of this,
the results reported herein are inconclusive with respect to
the original design objective. The observed HR with the
originally planned 192 events would have reached a significance level of .05 (95% CI, 0.57-0.99). There can be no
way of knowing whether the observed HR would have
been maintained over the additional events.
We conclude that immunotherapy for patients with
AML in first CR using this dose and schedule of rIL-2 was
not well accepted by patients after prolonged and intensive consolidation therapies, including AHSCT. However, the observed results provide important information
regarding the use of rIL-2 in this setting. Patient refusal
compromised the original trial design despite an accepta1016

ble level of toxicity associated with rIL-2 therapy. Significant improvements in outcomes were not observed. We
believe that the unanticipated failure to meet the accrual
goals to this final part of the overall study with the consequent loss of statistical power impacted on the outcomes
of this trial. The goal of modulating the innate immune
response against minimal residual disease in patients with
AML remains valid in our view. Trial designs have to
anticipate the potential problem of therapy-related fatigue
by focusing on a patient’s antecedent intensity and length
of therapy; the dislocations and inconveniences related to
late investigational interventions; and, not least, the need
to maintain physician commitment and enthusiasm
throughout the process.
FUNDING SUPPORT
The research for Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 19808
(Alliance) was supported in part by grants from the National Cancer Institute (CA31946) to the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Monica M. Bertagnolli, MD, Chair) and to the Alliance
Statistical Center (Daniel J. Sargent, PhD; CA33601).
