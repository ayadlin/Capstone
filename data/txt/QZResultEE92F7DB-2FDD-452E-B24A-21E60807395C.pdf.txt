ABSTRACT
The eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is significant for cancer therapy
and prevention. In this study, we evaluated WM130, a novel derivative of matrine,
for its effect on CSCs using human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, their
sphere cells, and sorted EpCAM+ cells. We revealed that WM130 could not only inhibit
proliferation and colony formation of HCC cells, but also suppress the expression
of some stemness-related genes and up-regulate some mature hepatocyte marker
genes, indicating a promotion of differentiation from CSCs to hepatocytes. WM130
also suppressed the proliferation of doxorubicin-resistant hepatoma cells, and
markedly reduced the cells with CSC biomarker EpCAM. Moreover, WM130 suppressed
HCC spheres, not only primary spheres but also subsequent spheres, indicating an
inhibitory effect on self-renewal capability of CSCs. Interestingly, WM130 exhibited
a remarkable inhibitory preference on HCC spheres and EpCAM+ cells rather than
their parental HCC cells and EpCAM- cells respectively. In vivo, WM130 inhibited HCC
xenograft growth, decreased the number of sphere-forming cells, and remarkably
decreased the levels of EpCAM mRNA and protein in tumor xenografts. Better
inhibitory effect was achieved by WM130 in combination with doxorubicin. Further
mechanism study revealed that WM130 inhibited AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling
pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that WM130 remarkably inhibits hepatic
CSCs, and this effect may via the down-regulation of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin
pathway. These findings provide a strong rationale for the use of WM130 as a novel
drug candidate in HCC therapy.

in vitro, self-renewal, differentiation and resistance to
chemo- and radiotherapies. CSCs are responsible for cancer
initiation, growth, metastasis and recurrence, and have been
regarded as a critical target for cancer eradication [20].
Actually, neutralizing antibodies, RNA interference against
CSC markers, and small molecule CSC inhibitors alone or
in combination with chemotherapies have been shown to
reduce tumor incidence, growth, and metastasis in animal
models [10, 14, 19–24]. Thereby, therapy specifically
eradicating CSCs, either alone or in combination with
conventional chemotherapies, may provide advantages for
cancer eradication.

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide
[1]. Increasing evidence indicates that a small subpopulation
of cancer cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), exist
in many types of cancer [2–8]. Recently, the existence of
CSCs has also been shown in liver cancer cell lines and
primary HCC specimens [9–19]. HCC CSCs can be isolated
and characterized by using various stem cell markers such
as EpCAM, CD133, CD90 and CD44. They exhibit stem
cell-like characteristics such as spherical colony formation

Matrine (Figure 1A), a major active alkaloid of the
Chinese herbal medicine Sophora flavescens Ait, possesses
significant anti-neoplastic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic,
and anti-viral properties [25–31]. It has been used in
clinic in China for the treatment of cancer, viral hepatitis,
enteritis, viral myocarditis, arrhythmia, colpitis and
eczema [32]. Nevertheless, its potency is relatively low
and its half-life is relatively short. To improve its features
as a drug, we have recently semi-synthesized a series of
matrine derivatives by replacing the carbonyl oxygen atom
with a sulfur atom and introducing various amino groups
to the keto-beta position. These derivatives exhibit better
anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-tumor activities
[33–36]. WM130 (C30N4H40SO5F; Figure 1A) is one of the
novel matrine derivatives with improved pharmacological
activities. In this study, we examined WM130 for its effect
on inhibiting hepatic cancer stem-like cells in both HCC
cell lines and xenografts, and elucidated the underlying
mechanism.

increasing was eliminated by WM130 treatment (Figure
2B). More specifically, after WM130 treatments, the
EpCAM+ cells were reduced from 32.32% to 3.04%,
and from 27.99% to 2.02% in DOX-resistant Hep3B and
MHCC-LM3 cells respectively. In contrast, no inhibitory
effect was observed of DOX.
We further detected the expression of some
stemness-related genes and mature hepatocyte biomarker
genes in hepatoma cells. WM130 treatment concentrationdependently reduced the mRNA levels of stemness-related
gene EpCAM, CD133, CD90, Oct3/4, Sox2 and NANOG
in HCC cells (Figure 2C and 2E, Supplementary Figure
S1B). As to liver-specific genes, WM130 increased the
expression of cytochrome P450(CYP)1A3 (CYP1A3),
glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-P), albumin (ALB),
aldolase B (ALDOB), which was accompanied by the
down-regulation of hepatocyte malignance gene alphafetoprotein (AFP), while biliverdin synthetase (BR)
expression remained unchanged (Figure 2D and 2F,
Supplementary Figure S1C). These results suggest that
WM130 may inhibit cancer stem-like cell and promote
the differentiation from CSCs to hepatocytes.

RESULTS
WM130 inhibits proliferation and colony
formation of hepatoma cells

WM130 inhibits HCC spheres among hepatoma
cells

WM130 suppressed the proliferation of HCC cell
lines, including Hep3B, MHCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H,
in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values
being 8.2, 10.6 and 12.5 μmol/L respectively (Figure 1B).
Moreover, WM130 exerted its effect in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 1C), and its anti-proliferative effect was
enhanced with the passing of time.
We further examined the effect of WM130 on colony
formation of hepatoma cells through clonogenic assay. The
results indicated that WM130 significantly reduced the
number of formed colonies, and the results are consistent
in all the three HCC cell lines tested (Figure 1D and 1E).
Notably, the immortalized human hepatocyte cell
line L02 and rat primary hepatocytes were not affected
by WM130 at the concentrations tested (data not shown),
which indicated that WM130 exerted a more selective
activity against HCC cells than normal cells.

To determine the effect of WM130 on HCC
spheres, we enriched populations of hepatic cancer
stem-like cells using the sphere culture technique. Flow
cytometric analysis revealed that WM130 treatment
reduced the number of EpCAM+ cells in Hep3B, MHCCLM3 and MHCC-97H spheres in a concentrationdependent manner, while WM130 rendered no evident
influence on CD133+ cells (Figure 3A). WM130
concentration-dependently inhibited the formation of
primary spheres, as evidenced by both reduced number
and decreased size of the spheres (Figure 3B and 3C).
Moreover, the number of subsequent spheres were also
reduced under condition that WM130-treated primary
spheres were cultured for subsequent two passages in the
absence of WM130 (Figure 3B), indicating that WM130
inhibited the self-renewal ability of CSCs.
The inhibitory effect of WM130 on HCC spheres
was confirmed in a xenograft model. WM130-treated
Hep3B spheres and vehicle-treated spheres were
subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Palpable
tumors (about 1 mm in diameter) developed from
vehicle-treated spheres within 2-3 weeks, while
WM130 treatment delayed palpable tumor formation
by about 2 weeks. The tumor xenografts derived from
WM130-treated spheres were significantly smaller
than those derived from control spheres (Figure 3D).
Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the number
of EpCAM+ cells was significantly diminished (p <
0.01) in the WM130 group compared with the control
group (Figure 3E).

WM130 inhibits proliferation of doxorubicin
(DOX)-resistant hepatoma cells and reduces

We further examined the effect of WM130 on
DOX-resistant cells expressing CSC biomarker EpCAM.
DOX-resistant HCC cells were obtained by exposing HCC
cells (Hep3B and MHCC-LM3) to 2 μmol/L DOX for 5
days. The cells were resistant to DOX but still sensitive
to WM130 (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1A).
Remarkably, among the DOX-resistant cells, the number
of EpCAM+ cells was significantly increased and this

the HCC cells rather than their spheres (Figure 4A, 4B
and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). Moreover,
WM130 preferentially decreased the EpCAM mRNA
in all the three types of spheres than in their parental
cells. Nevertheless, as to the influence of WM130 on

the expression of CD133 and Oct3/4, no preference was
observed on spheres or their parental cells (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Figure S2C).
We fractionated Hep3B cells into EpCAM+ and
EpCAM- subpopulations by magnetic-activated cell
sorting, with more than 99% purity in EpCAM+ cells and
more than 82% purity in EpCAM- cells (Supplementary
Figure S3A). The sorted EpCAM+ Hep3B cells exhibited
stronger proliferation ability and sphere forming ability
than EpCAM- cells (Supplementary Figure S3B and
S3C). We generated single-cell derived clones by
introducing EpCAM+ Hep3B cells into 96-well plates at
a dilution yielding an average of <1 cell per well. The
limiting dilution assay results indicated that 50% of
EpCAM+ Hep3B single cells formed monoclones after
7 days’ culture. The number of monoclones reached
80% after the second 7 days’ culture. After the third 7
days’ culture, all EpCAM+ Hep3B single cells formed

monoclones. These results suggested that EpCAM+
cells could serve as a part of cancer stem/progenitor
cells. WM130 exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect
on the proliferation of EpCAM+ subpopulations than
EpCAM- subpopulations (Figure 4D). WM130 also
concentration-dependently reduced the number of
EpCAM+ cells in sorted EpCAM+ subpopulations as
determined by flow cytometric analysis (Figure 4E).
Consistently, WM130 inhibited the sphere formation
of sorted EpCAM+ subpopulations. More specifically,
WM130 treatment clearly reduced the number of primary
spheres (Figure 4F). Furthermore, when WM130-treated
primary spheres were cultured for the second passage in
the absence of drug, the number of spherical colonies
also significantly decreased compared with the control
(Figure 4F). Moreover, WM130 also concentrationdependently reduced the size of single-cell derived
EpCAM+ monoclones (Supplementary Figure S3D).

Effect of WM130 on HCC xenograft growth

We further investigated whether WM130 directly
targeted hepatic cancer stem-like cells in vivo. The number
of sphere-forming cells decreased in WM130-treated
tumors compared with the control tumors. In contrast, the
number increased in DOX-treated tumors. Of note, WM130
further reduced the number of tumor sphere-forming cells
when administered in combination with DOX (Figure
5D and 5E). Further investigation revealed that WM130
administration remarkably decreased the levels of EpCAM
mRNA and protein in tumor xenografts (Figure 5F, Figure
6C and D), which was accompanied by the increased
expression of CYP1A3, G-6-P and ALB. In contrast, DOX

Using nude mice, we evaluated the anti-tumor effect
of WM130 in vivo. WM130 markedly inhibited the growth
of MHCC-LM3 xenografts. The combination of DOX
and WM130 exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor
growth than either WM130 or DOX alone (Figure 5A).
These results were in accordance with the weights of
MHCC-LM3 xenografts at sacrifice (Figure 5B). The
average body weight of WM130-treated mice did not vary
significantly throughout the experiment, and WM130 did
not aggravate DOX-induced weight loss (Figure 5C).

decreased the expression of CYP1A3 and ALB (Figure 5F).
In addition, the colony formation ability of MHCCLM3 cells from WM130-treated mice and WM130 plus
DOX-treated mice significantly decreased compared with

the control (Supplementary Figure S4A). Of note, MHCCLM3 cells from DOX-treated mice displayed higher
proliferation ability than those from control mice, and the
cells were resistant to DOX but sensitive to WM130 upon
in vitro treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B).

the phosphorylation of GSK3β (Ser9) and decreased
the expression of β-catenin and its target EpCAM in
the xenografts, as evidenced by western blotting and
immunostaining results (Figure 6C and 6D).
We have previously shown that WM130 suppressed
the AKT pathway in HCC cells [36]. To investigate if
the inhibition of the AKT/GSK3β pathway contributed
to the inhibitory actions of WM130 on hepatic CSCs,
EpCAM+ cells were treated with series concentrations of
WM130 and specific AKT inhibitor MK2206 (0.5 μM)
or GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021 (2.5 μM). As shown in

Further mechanism study revealed that WM130
markedly decreased the phosphorylation of GSK3β
(Ser9) in Hep3B and MHCC-LM3 cells. Moreover,
WM130 reduced the protein level of β-catenin in parallel
with decreased expression of Cyclin D1, a Wnt/β-catenin
target gene (Figure 6A and 6B). Consistent results were
obtained in vivo in the MHCC-LM3 tumor xenografts.
More specifically, WM130 administration notably reduced

Figure 6E and 6F, treatment with MK2206 resulted in slight
inhibition of cell proliferation and sphere formation, and cotreatment of cells with WM130 and MK2206 result in a
greater inhibition than that observed with WM130 alone. In
contrast, CHIR99021 increased cell proliferation and sphere
formation, and antagonized WM130’s effects on inhibiting
the growth and sphere formation of EpCAM+ cells.

In a xenograft model, we substantiated our
observations in vitro that WM130 preferred to inhibit
CSLCs. WM130 alone had an inhibitory effect on tumor
growth and markedly reduced the number of surviving
CSLCs. In contrast, DOX inhibited tumor growth but
increased the number of surviving CSLCs. Notably,
cotreatment with DOX and WM130 resulted in a higher
inhibition of tumor growth than treatment alone. Moreover,
the number of surviving CSLCs in DOX and WM130cotreated mice was even lower, which was consistent with
our in vitro finding that WM130 suppressed DOX-resistant
HCC cells, especially EpCAM+ cells. It would be more
definitive to assess the ability of residual cancer stem cells
to initiate tumors upon secondary implantation in NOD/
SCID mice [21, 37]. Notwithstanding this limitation, this
study does suggest that WM130 preferentially targeted
hepatic CSLCs rather than the bulk cell population.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is one of the key pathways
for CSC self-renewal [38]. The expression of the hepatic
stem cell biomarker EpCAM is regulated by Wnt/βcatenin signaling, and β-catenin degradation or β-catenin
inhibitors could reduce EpCAM gene expression [14, 39].
We have previously shown that WM130 could inhibit
the growth of tumor xenografts and suppress EGFR and
PTEN/AKT signaling pathways [36]. In the current study,
we showed that WM130 could reduce the protein levels of
β-catenin and its target gene Cyclin D1 in hepatoma cells.
Importantly, downregulation of β-catenin and EpCAM
proteins was clearly observed in tumor xenografts of
WM130-treated groups. These results suggested that
WM130 could downregulate the Wnt/β-catenin selfrenewal pathway. The level of intracellular β-catenin is
regulated by AKT substrate GSK3β, which phosphorylates
β-catenin and promotes ubiquitin-proteasome degradation
of the phosphorylated β-catenin [40]. Phosphorylation
of GSK3β at Ser9 results in its inhibition, thereby the
stabilization of β-catenin [41, 42]. Our data clearly
demonstrated that WM130 decreased the phosphorylation
of GSK3β (Ser9) in HCC cells and tumor xenografts,
suggesting that WM130-induced β-catenin degradation
was possibly mediated by the activation of GSK3β.
Recently, an AKT inhibitor has been demonstrated to
potently reduce the number of brain cancer stem cells.
This effect was associated with a preferential induction
of apoptosis and a suppression of neurosphere formation
[43]. To conclude that the inhibition of the AKT/GSK3β
pathway by WM130 contributes to its inhibitory effect on
hepatic CSCs, we used specific AKT inhibitor MK2206
and GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021. The results verified
our speculation. MK2206 inhibited, whereas CHIR99021
increased EpCAM+ cell proliferation and sphere
formation. Moreover, co-treatment of cells with WM130
and MK2206 had an additive effect, while CHIR99021
antagonised WM130’s effect. Taken together, our data
suggest that the inhibitory effect of WM130 on hepatic

DISCUSSION
CSCs are believed to be responsible for HCC
growth and relapse, and the cure of HCC requires the
eradication of hepatic cancer stem cells [14, 17]. WM130
has been previously shown to inhibit hepatoma Huh-7
cell xenograft growth. This effect is associated with the
inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and
the induction of apoptosis in HCC cells [36]. Nevertheless,
the effect of WM130 on CSCs remains unknown. In
the current study, by using hepatoma sphere cells and
the sorted hepatoma EpCAM+ cells, we evaluated the
inhibitory effect of WM130 on HCC CSCs.
Through sphere culture technique, we found that
three types of Hep3B, MHCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H
spheres exhibited CSC features, including self-renewal,
clonogenicity, expression of CSC biomarkers EpCAM
and CD133, and resistance to chemotherapeutic drug
such as DOX. The CSC features of Hep3B spheres were
confirmed by the findings in in vivo tumorigenicity assay.
Using these sphere cells as models, we found that WM130
concentration-dependently reduced the subpopulation
expressing CSC biomarkers EpCAM/CD133. Moreover,
the WM130-treated sphere cells exhibited weaker
tumorigenicity in mice compared with the control. CSCs
being resistant to chemotherapy, our results also showed
that WM130 could inhibit DOX-resistant cells and
eliminate the remarkable increase of EpCAM+ cells in the
resistant cells. Of note, the WM130-induced reduction
of cancer stem-like cells (EpCAM/CD133 positive)
appeared to be associated with the suppression of selfrenewal capability and the promotion of differentiation
from CSCs to hepatocytes. More specifically, WM130
induced a marked decrease not only for primary spheres,
but also for spheres in the subsequent two passages without
WM130 treatment, indicating the suppression of selfrenewal capability. Additionally, the expression of stem
cell biomarkers was reduced and the expression of mature
hepatocyte biomarkers was increased in the WM130-treated
HCC cells, indicating the promotion of differentiation from
CSCs to hepatocytes. Interestingly, in contrast to DOX,
WM130 preferred to inhibit sphere cell proliferation,
colony formation and EpCAM mRNA expression.
Consistently, WM130 had a stronger inhibitory effect on
EpCAM+ subpopulations than EpCAM- subpopulations.
Collectively, these data suggest that WM130 can selectively
inhibit cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs).

CSLCs was mediated, at least partly, by inhibiting the
AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.
Collectively, this study demonstrates that WM130
preferentially inhibits hepatic CSLCs and reduces HCC
xenograft growth. These beneficial effects were associated
with the downregulation of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin
signaling pathway. We also show that the combination of
WM130 and DOX exhibits a stronger anti-cancer efficacy
than either treatment alone. These findings provide a
strong rationale for the development of WM130 as a novel
drug candidate for HCC therapy.

Japan), and the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) was
calculated. For the colony formation assay, cells were
seeded at a density of 1×103 cells per well in 6-well plates
(NEST Biotech) and treated with or without WM130.
Culture medium was changed every 3-5 days. 17-21 days
later, the colonies were stained with Coomassie brilliant
blue and photographed. The total number of colonies (>50
cells/colony) was counted.

Spheroid formation assay
Spheroid culture was performed as described
previously [11, 21] with a slight modification. Briefly,
HCC spheres were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented
with FGF (20 ng/mL), EGF (20 ng/mL), B27 (1×), ITS
(1×), and L-glutamine (1×). For WM130 treatment,
primary sphere cells were dissociated with trypsin to a
single cell suspension and seeded in 96-well ultra-low
attachment plates (Corning, Lowell, MA) at a density of
1×103 cells/well. The cells were then exposed to various
concentrations of WM130 for 7 days. The second and third
passages of cells were grown for 7 days in the absence of
WM130. The number of spheres (>30 μm in diameter) was
counted, and spheres were photographed under a phase
contrast microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Human HCC cell lines Hep3B, MHCC-LM3, and
MHCC-97H were kindly provided by the Department

grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL,
NY), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin in a

Antibodies against β-catenin, GSK-3β, phospho-GSK-3β
(Ser9), and EpCAM were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against Cyclin D1
and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA). IRDye680-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
secondary antibodies were purchased from Rockland
(Gilbertsville, PA). AKT inhibitor MK2206 and GSK3β
inhibitor CHIR99021 were purchased from Selleck
Chemicals (Shanghai, China).

Isolation of EpCAM+ and EpCAM- HCC cells
To obtain EpCAM+ and EpCAM- enriched cell
populations, cells were firstly incubated with EpCAM
antibodies conjugated with magnetic beads with biotin
binded. Separation was carried out by using a magnetic
column (Miltenyi Biotec). EpCAM+ cells were maintained
in their undifferentiated state using stem cell medium.
EpCAM- cells were maintained in their differentiated state
with DMEM medium. To examine the effect of WM130,
EpCAM- medium was changed to EpCAM+ medium
before treatment with WM130.

Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were harvested and incubated with anti-AC133PE and anti-EpCAM-APC antibodies. Isotype-matched
mouse anti-IgG1-PE and anti-IgG1-APC were used for
controls. Samples were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using an RNAsimple
Total RNA Kit (Tiangen, Shanghai, China). cDNA was
synthesized from 1 µg total RNA using a Prime Script
RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Real-time PCR
was performed using a SYBR Green PCR Kit (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China) with the primers listed in Supplementary
Table S1. The mRNA expression was normalized against
β-actin mRNA levels.

Cell proliferation and colony formation assays
HCC cells were cultured at a density of 3 ×103
cells per well in 96-well plates (NEST Biotech, Wuxi,
China) overnight and then exposed to WM130. After 72
h of culture, cell proliferation was assessed using a Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK8, Dojindo Laboratories, Tokyo,

conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Gene Tech, Shanghai,
China) as the secondary antibody. All staining was
visualized and photographed under an ordinary optical
microscope. Areas of immunohistochemically positive
and negative cells were determined using a computerassisted automated image analyzer (Qwin Leica) as
described previously [34].

Proteins were extracted, and approximately 20 μg
of total proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary
antibodies against β-catenin (1:1000), Cyclin D1 (1:1000),
GSK-3β (1:500), phospho-GSK-3β (1:1000), or GAPDH
(1:3000), followed by IRDye680-conjugated anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000). Detection was
performed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR Biotechnology, Nebraska).

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using oneway analysis of variance or the two-tailed Student’s t
test. p < 0.05 was considered as the minimum level of
significance.

Tumor xenograft model
Four-week-old male Balb/c nude mice were
purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal
Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Hep3B spheres were treated
with or without 10 μmol/L WM130 for 4 days and then
allowed to recover and expand for another 4 days without
treatment prior to injection. The WM130-treated cells
(1×105) were mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and
subcutaneously injected into the flank of each mouse. To
avoid individual differences, an equal number of vehicletreated control cells were subcutaneously injected into
the opposite flank of the same mouse. Tumor growth was
monitored for 45 days after cell injection.
For in vivo drug treatments, 1×106 MHCC-LM3
cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Drug
treatments were initiated at 24 h after cell injection.
Animals were administered either saline, WM130 (20 mg/
kg, orally by gavage daily), DOX (6 mg/kg, intraperitoneal
injection, once a week), or WM130 in combination with
DOX for 3 weeks. The tumor size was measured with a
caliper as the longest surface length (mm; L) and width
(mm; W). Tumor volume (mm3; V) was calculated as
V=1/2×LW2. All mice were sacrificed, and tumor tissues
were excised and weighted at the end of experiments.
A portion of the tumor tissues was dissociated
enzymatically to obtain a single cell suspension for
spheroid formation assay, proliferation assay and colony
formation assay, and the remaining tumor tissues were
used for real-time RT-PCR analysis, western blotting and
immunostaining. All procedures involving animals and
their care were approved by our institutional Animal Care
Committee in accordance with the institutional guidelines
for animal experiments.
