Abstract:

The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway leads to activation of GLI, which
transcriptionally regulate target genes. Regulated HH signaling activity is critical
during embryogenesis while aberrantly activated HH signaling is evident in a variety
of human cancers. Canonical HH signaling engages the transmembrane receptor
Patched (PTCH) and the signaling intermediate Smoothened (SMO) to activate GLI1
and GLI2. In addition GLI1 and GLI2 are activated by non-canonical oncogenic
signaling pathways to further drive HH-dependent survival. We have demonstrated
in human colon carcinoma cells that inhibition of the RAS/RAF pathway by U0126
decreases p-ERK protein expression and also inhibits GLI-luciferase activity and
GLI1 mRNA and protein levels. Of importance is the demonstration that targeting
of SMO (using cyclopamine) has minimal effect on cell survival in comparison
to the inhibition of GLI (using GANT61), which induced extensive cell death in
7/7 human colon carcinoma cell lines. Genetic inhibition of the function of GLI1
and GLI2 by transient transfection of the C-terminus deleted repressor GLI3R,
reduced proliferation and induced cleavage of caspase-3 and cell death in HT29
cells, similar to the effects of GANT61. Mechanistically, downstream of GLI1 and
GLI2 inhibition, γH2AX (a marker of DNA double strand breaks) expression was
upregulated, and γH2AX nuclear foci were demonstrated in cells that expressed
GLI3R. Activation of the ATM/Chk2 axis with co-localization of γH2AX and p-Chk2
nuclear foci were demonstrated following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition. GANT61 induced
cellular accumulation at G1/S and early S with no further progression before cells
became subG1, while cDNA microarray gene profiling demonstrated downregulation
of genes involved in DNA replication, the DNA damage response, and DNA repair,
mechanisms that are currently being pursued. These studies highlight the importance
of targeting the GLI genes downstream of SMO for terminating HH-dependent
survival, suggesting that GLI may constitute a molecular switch that determines
the balance between cell survival and cell death in human colon carcinoma.

CANONICAL HEDGEHOG SIGNALING
IN CANCER

aberrant activation of the HH pathway by ligandindependent signaling such as, amplification of GLI1 or
GLI2, mutations in PTCH or SMO, or dysregulated gene
expression[1, 3]. In colon cancer, aberrant HH signaling
progresses during carcinogenesis and in metastatic
disease[4-6], and is also activated in human colon
carcinoma cell lines[7-9] and xenograft models[4], by
ligand-dependent activation, that occurs in GI cancers[1,
10]. However, the role of HH signaling and its importance

Canonical HH signaling engages PTCH, SMO and
the GLI family of transcription factors (Figure 1), and in
normal cellular processes is involved in embryogenesis,
tissue patterning, stem cell function, and differentiation[1,

Non-canonical, oncogene-driven signaling pathways
converge on the activation of GLI genes and further
converge on their specific downstream targets[3, 18, 21,
22] (see Figure 1). The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway,
with activating mutations in K-RAS or B-RAF that occur
in high frequency in colon cancers[23-25], activates GLI
function[18, 19, 21]. In HT29 cells (mutated B-RAF
V600E[25]), we demonstrated inhibition of GLIluciferase reporter activity, reduced expression of GLI1
mRNA and protein, and of p-ERK in response to the
MEK/ERK and RAS/RAF signaling inhibitor U0126[26,
27] (Figure 2). While loss-of-function mutations in
PTCH and gain-of-function mutations in SMO activate
HH signaling[1], acquired mutations in SMO or noncanonical GLI activation render cancer cells resistant
to SMO antagonists. These observations emphasize the
importance of targeting the GLI genes downstream of
SMO for terminating HH-dependent survival and inducing
cell death in colon carcinoma cells. It therefore follows
that termination of HH signaling at the level of GLI may
constitute a molecular switch that determines the balance
between cell survival or cell death.

in driving cellular survival in colon cancer are not well
defined. Small molecule inhibitors of SMO have been
studied in preclinical models, and applied to the treatment
of various types of cancers in humans[4, 9, 11-14]. Those
tumors sensitive to SMO inhibitors, which include basal
cell carcinoma[15, 16] and medulloblastoma[11, 17],
rely on canonical HH signaling for cellular survival. In
other cancer types, SMO inhibitors including GDC-0449,
IPI-926 or LDE225, have demonstrated limited clinical
activity (reviewed in [11, 12]). Intrinsic resistance to
SMO inhibitors is frequent[11-14, 18, 19], and acquired
resistance to GDC-0449 following initial response has
been reported in medulloblastoma (heterozygous mutation,
Asp->His at aa 473 in SMO)[20]. Thus targeting the GLI
genes downstream of SMO, that constitute the core of
HH-dependent gene regulation, may provide a significant
advantage in eliminating HH signaling.

TARGETING GLI1 AND GLI2 WITH
GANT61
One of the gaps in our knowledge is that the impact
of terminating HH signaling at the level of the GLI genes is
unclear. The GLI family of transcription factors regulates
target gene expression that determines HH-dependent
survival. GLI1 and GLI2 are the primary activators of
HH signaling; further, the cooperative roles of GLI1 and
GLI2 are critical in the transcriptional regulation of HH
target genes[1, 28-30]. While SMO has been extensively
investigated as a therapeutic target[11-15, 17], few agents
are available that target the GLI genes[31]. GANT61

inhibitors of GLI1-mediated transcription. In the original
study[31], GANT61 1) functions in the nucleus to abrogate
GLI function; 2) blocks both GLI1- and GLI2- mediated
transcription; 3) in SUFU-null MEFS with constitutively
active HH signaling, reduces expression of GLI1 and
HIP1 mRNA in contrast to cyclopamine; 4) inhibits
GLI1 DNA binding activity (EMSA analysis). We further

GANT61, and the classic SMO inhibitor
cyclopamine (for comparison with other model systems),
were evaluated in a panel of human colon carcinoma
cell lines to determine the impact of inhibiting GLI1/
GLI2 vs SMO. Inhibition of GLI1 and GLI2 by GANT61
induced > 80% cell death in 5/7 human colon carcinoma
cell lines following 72 hr exposure (20 µM). In contrast,
cyclopamine induced < 30% cell death in 6/7 cell lines,
at equimolar concentrations (20 µM; Figure 3). In time
course studies, 24 hr exposure to GANT61 or 72 hr
exposure to cyclopamine was required to initiate cell
death[8]. In addition the SMO inhibitor GDC-0449, like
cyclopamine, demonstrated limited cytotoxic activity
in HT29 cells at equimolar concentrations (unpublished
data). Collectively, the data demonstrate increased
sensitivity of human colon cancer cells to inhibition of GLI

the presence of a non-canonical mode of GLI activation in
human colon cancer cells. These concentrations and time
frames for the induction of cellular effects are similar to
those determined in other model systems for inhibitors of
HH signaling[4, 19, 33].

induce parallel changes in events leading to cell death,
including the induction of γH2AX nuclear foci. One of the
critical regulators of DNA damage response is p53, which
is stabilized upon DNA damage and modulates multiple
components of the DNA damage response pathway[36,
37]. Expression of Gli3R-myc in human colon carcinoma
cell lines harboring mutant p53 (functionally inactive)
demonstrated DNA damage response suggesting a p53
independent mechanism[32]. Further, GANT61 treatment
of HT29 cells demonstrated a p21Cip1-independent
mechanism of cell death[32].

A third member of the GLI family is GLI3. A
cleaved C-terminally truncated form of GLI3 (GLI3R)
demonstrates repressor activity for GLI1 and GLI2
transcriptional regulation, and thereby silences HH-GLI
target genes[4, 34]. We confirmed the critical role of GLI1
and GLI2 in cell survival by genetic downregulation
of GLI1 and GLI2 following transient transfection of
GLI3R[4, 34] in HT29 cells. Transient transfection and
expression of GLI3R (GLI3R-pCS2-MT, N-terminal
Myc-epitope tag) over a period of 72 hr paralleled the
effects of GANT61 by inducing significant changes in
cellular morphology, reduced expression of GLI1 and
GLI2, reduced proliferation, and induction of cell death.
GLI3R-myc expression was detected by 24 hr, with
strong expression by 48 hr[32]. Under these conditions of
GLI3R transient transfection, GLI1 and GLI2 expression
was decreased, with significant cleavage of caspase-3
(Figure 4). To begin to explore the cellular mechanisms
downstream of GLI1/GLI2 inhibition that lead to cell
death, we demonstrated that γH2AX, a marker of DNA
DSBs[35], was expressed in GANT61-treated cells
(Figure 4). Further, γH2AX nuclear foci were detected in
the cells expressing GLI3R-myc[32]. Thus, both genetic
and pharmacologic downregulation of GLI1 and GLI2

GLI2 inhibition by GANT61. In activation of the intra-Sphase checkpoint, Cdc25A is phosphorylated on Ser123,
which targets this phosphatase for degradation by the
proteasome. Activation of Cdk2 and the loading of Cdc45
onto replication origins are inhibited, DNA replication
is inhibited, the intra-S-phase checkpoint is activated,
and cyclin E accumulates[43-45], as demonstrated
in GANT61-treated HT29 cells at 24 hr (Figure 6B).
Accumulation of HT29 cells in early S[9](Figure 6A), and
the data of Figure 6B, suggest activation of an intra-Sphase checkpoint, which is not sustained.

expression remained undetectable[32]. p-Chk2 nuclear
foci co-localized with γH2AX nuclear foci at the sites
of DNA DSBs in GANT61-treated cells (Figure 5). An
ATM/Chk2 axis was therefore activated in GANT61treated human colon carcinoma cells as an early event in
the response to DNA damage.

Inhibition of GLI1/GLI2 BY GANT61
induces arrest in early S
Using HT29 cells we have demonstrated that cells
treated with GANT61 (20 µM) accumulate in early
S-phase and fail to progress further through or beyond
early S before becoming subG1[7, 32]. By cell cycle
analysis, cells were observed to move from G1 into early
S by 32 hr where they remain, detected as two discrete
peaks (G1/S, early S; Figure 6A). Analysis by FACS/
BrdU incorporation at 32 hr after GANT61 exposure
demonstrated a shift in G1/S-phase cells from 8.0% BrdU
incorporation in the control to 52.3% at 32 hr, and S-phase
cells from 25.0% to 33.6%[32]. In contrast 5-fluorouracil
(FUra) combined with leucovorin (1 µM), which targets
thymidylate synthase in the inhibition of DNA replication
and induction of DNA damage, arrested HT29 cells in mid
S-phase[38] (67.0% by FACS/PI staining; Figure 6A),
thereby demonstrating the difference in S-phase target
location of the mechanism of GANT61-induced inhibition
of DNA replication. The cell cycle checkpoints constitute
a regulatory mechanism to arrest the cell cycle in response
to DNA damage so that cell cycle progression and repair
may be temporally coordinated[39-42]. In contrast to
the checkpoints at the G1/S and G2/M transitions, the
S-phase checkpoint can only delay the progression of
S-phase. ATM is the master transducer of the S-phase
checkpoint, responds to DNA DSBs, and together with
its effector kinase Chk2, is activated in response to GLI1/

essential for tumour growth, recurrence, metastasis and

1(6-7):338-351.

We have demonstrated in human colon carcinoma
cells that the GLI genes, the transcriptional regulators of
the HH signaling response, are activated by both canonical
signaling (via SMO) and by non-canonical activation
(via the RAS/RAF pathway), which is activated in high
frequency in colon cancers. Both pharmacologic and
genetic inhibition of GLI function reduced proliferation,
GLI1 and GLI2 expression, induced γH2AX expression,
cleavage of caspase-3, and cell death. In contrast
inhibition of SMO was significantly less effective at
inducing cell death in contrast to targeting GLI. DNA
damage signaling involved an ATM/Chk2 axis, with Chk2
co-localizing with γH2AX at the sites of DNA DSBs.
Further, cells accumulated in early S-phase following
GANT61 exposure but did not progress before becoming
subG1, suggesting an intra-S-phase checkpoint that could
not be sustained. From cDNA microarray gene profiling,
genes involved in the inhibition of DNA replication,
DNA damage response, and DNA repair were identified
downstream of GANT61-induced GLI1/GLI2 inhibition.
Chromosome instability is found in the majority of colon
cancers, resulting primarily from deregulation of the DNA
replication and mitotic spindle checkpoints (reviewed in
[45]). Genes involved in canonical HH signaling have been
linked to genomic instability, involving inactivation of
DNA repair mechanisms, defects in checkpoint activation,
and predisposition to development of cancers[46-49]. It
therefore follows that termination of HH signaling at the
level of GLI may constitute a critical event in determining
the balance between cell survival and cell death. The
combination of molecular and cellular approaches that are
being employed will 1) provide critical new insight into
the role of GLI1/GLI2 in driving cellular survival, which
has never been addressed in any type of human cancer,
and will answer a fundamental question in HH biology, 2)
address how dysregulation of the GLI1/GLI2 axis induces
DNA damage upstream of cell death or DNA repair
upstream of cell survival and 3) provide a framework
for the design of strategies and therapeutics specifically
targeted at HH signaling via GLI1 and GLI2 in human
colon carcinoma.
