Breast Cancer Stem-like Cells in Murine Models via
EGFR/Stat3 and Tgfb/Smad Signaling

Abstract
Cancer stem-like cells contribute to tumor heterogeneity and
have been implicated in disease relapse and drug resistance.
Here we show the coexistence of distinct breast cancer stem-like
cells (BCSC) as identiﬁed by ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ markers, respectively, in murine models of breast cancer. While
both BCSC exhibit enhanced tumor-initiating potential,
CD29hiCD61þ BCSC displayed increased invasive abilities and
higher expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
mammary stem cell–associated genes, whereas ALDHþ BCSC
were more closely associated with luminal progenitors. Attenuating the autophagy regulator FIP200 diminished the tumor-

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among
women worldwide and some of the key challenges faced when
treating this widespread disease include therapeutic resistance,
relapse, and metastasis (1). There is increasing evidence to indicate that these challenges persist due to the existence of a subpopulation of cells within tumors termed cancer stem-like cells
(CSC; refs. 2–4). Initial isolation of breast CSCs (BCSC) demonstrated that not all cells within a tumor are equal and it is the
BCSCs that exhibit increased tumorigenicity and drive tumor
growth (5). In fact, BCSCs have been shown to exhibit resistance
to conventional therapies (3, 4) and drive metastasis (6). The
presence of BCSCs presents an additional layer of heterogeneity
within tumors alongside intratumor genetic diversity. Conventional chemotherapies that tend to eliminate just the bulk
tumor population enrich for BCSCs and this can lead to more
aggressive residual disease. Accordingly, therapeutic efforts now
account for BCSCs rather than just targeting the bulk tumor
population (7).
Meanwhile, plasticity exists where non-BCSC populations can
acquire BCSC properties through pathways such as epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT; refs. 8, 9). In addition, distinct

initiating properties of both ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ BCSC,
as achieved by impairing either the Stat3 or TGFb/Smad pathways, respectively. Furthermore, combining the Stat3 inhibitor
Stattic and the Tgfb-R1 inhibitor LY-2157299 inhibited the
formation of both epithelial and mesenchymal BCSC colonies.
In vivo, this combination treatment was sufﬁcient to limit tumor
growth and reduce BCSC number. Overall, our ﬁndings reveal
a differential dependence of heterogeneous BCSC populations
on divergent signaling pathways, with implications on how
to tailor drug combinations to improve therapeutic efﬁcacy.

BCSC populations with epithelial and mesenchymal properties,
respectively, have been described and the interconversion
between the two states has been demonstrated (10). These distinct
BCSCs were also shown to occupy different niches, where epithelial BCSCs were located in central regions of the tumor,
whereas mesenchymal BCSCs were found at the invasive front.
These observations raise the possibility that diverse BCSC populations may exist within a tumor and possibly have differential
susceptibilities to BCSC-targeted therapeutics. With that notion, it
would be imperative to account for heterogeneous BCSC populations and limiting the plasticity of these populations when
considering therapeutic strategies.
Autophagy is a self-cannibalization process, which involves the
sequestration of organelles, proteins, or lipids in vesicles termed
autophagosomes for degradation and recycling. Degradation
occurs upon fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and the
degraded products are exported into the cytoplasm for recycling
(11). Basal levels of autophagy are important to eliminate damaged organelles such as mitochondria and unfolded proteins.
Autophagy can also be induced to maintain homeostasis under
stressful conditions such as nutrient starvation. The physiologic
importance of autophagy is illustrated by the involvement of
autophagy-related (Atg) proteins in diseases such as cancer,
neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity (11).
In terms of the role of autophagy in cancer, a duality exists
where the autophagic process performs a tumor-suppressive
function during tumorigenesis but promotes malignancy in
advanced tumor progression (12). The homeostatic function of
autophagy limits genotoxic stress, inﬂammation, and production
of reactive oxygen species and this reduces the rate of mutagenesis
(13). On the other hand, autophagy confers survival advantages in
established tumors under stressful conditions such as hypoxia
and allows tumor cells to sustain demanding metabolic needs
(12, 14). It is also becoming apparent that autophagy impinges on

features that are crucial for metastatic dissemination. Autophagy
promotes resistance to anoikis, a trait that is important for the
survival of tumor cells that have detached and are circulating
(15, 16). In addition, autophagy has also been implicated in
promoting tumor cell invasion (17, 18). For these reasons, it is no
surprise that autophagy inhibitors such as hydroxychloroquine
are actively trialed in the clinic for treatment of cancers and
development of novel autophagy inhibitors are earnestly pursued
(19). Recent studies also implicated a role of autophagy specifically in BCSC populations. Impairing autophagy can affect
the maintenance of BCSCs through limiting EMT and the
CD44þ/CD24 phenotype (20). Beclin1 silencing could also
abrogate the propagation of BCSCs in mammosphere cultures
and their tumorigenicity in vivo (21). However, the underlying
molecular mechanism is still not well understood, and it is not
known whether autophagy may regulate different BCSC subsets
through different mechanisms.

Materials and Methods

(Addgene plasmid # 11011; ref. 22). Plasmids used for silencing Stat3 (TRCN71453, TRCN71454), Egfr (TRCN23482,
TRCN23480), and Smad4 (TRCN25885, TRCN25881) were
obtained from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Lenti-shRNA
library core. Antibodies used for immunoblotting include
b-actin (Sigma A5441), vinculin (Sigma V4505), EGFR (CST
4267), phospho-EGFR Y1068 (CST 3777), Jak2 (CST 3230),
phospho-Jak2 Y1007/1008 (CST 3776), Stat3 (CST 9139),
phospho-Stat3 (p-Stat3) Y705 (CST 9145), Smad2/3 (CST
3102), phospho-Smad2/3 (CST 8828), phospho-Smad2
(CST3101), Smad4 (CST 9515), Socs3 (CST 2932), and Pias3
(CST 9042). For ﬂow cytometry, antibodies used were CD29V450 (BD 562155), CD24-PE (BD553262), CD31-APC (Biolegend 102410), CD45-APC (Biolegend 103112), Ter119-APC
(116212), Streptavidin-APCcy7 (Biolegend 405208), and
CD61-biotin (eBioscience 13061185).
Cell culture, treatment, transfection, and transduction of cells
Primary tumor cells and their derivatives were cultured
in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL EGF,
20 mg/mL insulin, and 50 units/mL penicillin–streptomycin.
Recombinant TGFb was purchased from Gibco and cells were
treated at a concentration of 10 ng/mL. For colony formation
assays, cells were plated at a density of 1,000 cells/well in 6-well
plates and the number of colonies that formed after 7 days were
quantiﬁed after crystal violet staining. The generation of
FIP200f/f;PyMT;CreER cells have been described previously
(23) and deletion of Fip200 was induced by culturing with
100 nmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Transfection experiments were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent
(Invitrogen). Production of lentivirus and transduction of cells
were carried out as described previously (24).
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
Dissociated single-cell suspensions from primary tumors [as
described previously (24)] or cultured cells were incubated with
Aldeﬂuor reagent (Stem Cell Technologies) for 30 minutes
according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then rinsed
before incubation with CD61-biotin for 20 minutes at 4 C.

3398 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

Following that, cells were rinsed and incubated with other antibodies marking CSCs for 20 minutes at 4 C. Cells were then rinsed
and resuspended in Aldeﬂuor buffer before sorting or analysis by
FACSAria or FACSCanto instruments (BD Biosciences). Flow
cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software.
Tumor mice and transplants
MMTV-PyMT, Ctrl-MT (Fip200f/f, MMTV-PyMT), and cKO-MT
(Fip200f/f, MMTV-PyMT, MMTV-Cre) mice have been described
previously (14). MMTV-Wnt1 mice were obtained from Dr. Yi Li
of Baylor College of Medicine. Mice were housed and handled
according to local, state, and federal regulations. All experimental
procedures were carried out according to protocols approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of
Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH). For transplantation experiments,
cells were prepared in DMEM:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio and the
required number of cells were injected in a 50 mL volume orthotopically into the fourth inguinal mammary fat pads of athymic
nude mice (Harlan). For limiting dilution transplants, mice were
monitored for at least 3 months for the formation of tumors.
Tumor growth measurements were obtained using calipers and
volume was calculated as (1/2)(length)(width)2.
Boyden chamber invasion assays
Cells were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/well in Boyden
chambers coated with growth factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 24 hours. Cells on the membrane were
then ﬁxed with ice cold ethanol and stained with crystal violet.
Cells that have invaded to the lower side of the membrane were
then quantiﬁed.
Administration of Stattic and LY-2157299
Stattic was purchased from ApexBio and LY-2157299 was kind
gift from Eli Lilly. Drugs were prepared in vehicle [1% carboxymethylcellulose, 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.085% povidone,
and 0.05% anti-foam (kind gift from Xiameter)] for administration via orogastric gavage. Mice with orthotopically transplanted
PyMT cells were randomized into respective treatment groups
when the volume of tumors reached 50 mm3. The treatment
cohorts consisted of vehicle control, LY-2157299 only, Stattic
only or LY-2157299 and Stattic. LY-2157299 was administered
twice daily at 100 mg/kg doses, whereas Stattic was fed once daily
at 20 mg/kg doses. Mice cohorts were treated for a total of 21 days
in this treatment regimen with no observable side effects.
SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting
Lysates were prepared from cells using modiﬁed RIPA buffer
as described previously (24) with the addition of protease and
phosphatase inhibitors according to manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Protein concentrations were
then quantiﬁed by bicinchoninic acid method, subjected to
SDS–PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as described
previously (24).
RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of RNA
were then reverse transcribed using SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamers as primers.
cDNA samples were then subjected to qRT-PCR analysis with

used are detailed in Supplementary Figures.
RNA sequencing of sorted cell populations
RNA-sequencing experiments were performed by the Genomics, Epigenomics, and Sequencing Core in University of
Cincinnati. Brieﬂy, RNA from sorted cells was isolated using
mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
according to the manufacturer's instructions for total RNA
isolation. Targeted RNA enrichment was achieved using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England
BioLabs) and PrepX mRNA Library Kit (WaferGen) combined
with Apollo 324 NGS automated library prep system was used
for library preparation. Cluster generation and HiSeq sequencing were carried out using the cBot and HiSeq systems (Illumina), respectively. To analyze differential gene expression,
sequence reads were aligned to the genome using standard
Illumina sequence analysis pipeline, which was analyzed by
The Laboratory for Statistical Genomics and Systems Biology in
the University of Cincinnati.
IHC
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tumors were sectioned
(5 mm) and stained for respective antigens as described previously
(14). For antigen retrieval, slides were heated in citrate buffer in a
pressure cooker.
Statistical analysis
Data were plotted as means  SEM and statistical signiﬁcance
was determined using a two-tailed t test. Statistical differences
between groups for limiting dilution transplants were performed using ELDA as described previously (25). For tumor
growth curves, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test was used
to determine signiﬁcance. The threshold for signiﬁcance of
P values was 0.05.

Results
ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ markers identify distinct BCSC
populations in mammary tumors
The putative BCSC markers ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ have
been reported to enrich for CSC populations in mouse mammary
tumors (24, 26, 27). Nonetheless, there is evidence to suggest that
BCSCs with different characteristics can coexist within breast
tumors (10). For that reason, we set out to address whether
ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ populations identify identical overlapping subsets of CSCs or they are separate entities within
mammary tumors. First, we employed LinCD24þCD29hiCD61þ
as a marker to analyze BCSC content in the MMTV-PyMT and
MMTV-Wnt1 models, which represent luminal B and basal-like
subtypes of breast cancer, respectively (28). Under similar gating
criteria, we found a higher fraction of BCSCs (i.e., % Lin
CD24þCD29hiCD61þ cells out of total LinCD24þ cells) in
MMTV-Wnt1–driven tumors compared with those in MMTVPyMT–driven tumors (Fig. 1A, left and middle). Interestingly,
when we overlay the CD29hiCD61þ proﬁles of cells from both
tumor types, we identify three distinct populations that are
reminiscent of the CD29CD61 proﬁle of normal mammary
epithelial cells (MEC; Fig. 1A, right). Accordingly, when these
tumors were analyzed alongside MECs, we found that MMTVPyMT tumors, which have been described to display a luminal

www.aacrjournals.org

progenitor gene signature, coincide mostly with the CD29CD61
proﬁle of luminal progenitor (LP) and mature luminal (ML)
cells. It is also worth noting that a small proportion of cells from
MMTV-PyMT tumors reside within the mammary stem cell (MSC)
enriched gate. On the other hand, MMTV-Wnt1 tumors are
comprised mostly of cells that coincide within the MSC and ML
gates (Fig. 1B). We next used LinCD24þALDHþ as a BCSC
marker to analyze both tumor types and found that consistent
with results using LinCD24þCD29hiCD61þ, MMTV-Wnt1
tumors contained higher amounts of ALDHþ cells than MMTVPyMT tumors (Fig. 1C). However, surprisingly, we found that
ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ populations only overlap to a small
degree in either of these two tumors (Fig. 1D).
Although numerous markers and criteria have been described
to enrich for BCSCs in mouse mammary tumors, these markers
have not been studied concurrently. Our observation that ALDHþ
and CD29hiCD61þ populations overlap only minimally led
us to address whether both these populations are indeed
enriched for BCSCs or perhaps just the overlapping fraction (i.e.,
ALDHþCD29hiCD61þ) have BCSC activity. For that, we sorted
cells from freshly harvested tumors into four fractions termed P1
(CD29hiCD61þ only), P2 (ALDHþ only), P3 (ALDHþ and
CD29hiCD61þ), and P0 (bulk of ALDH, non CD29hiCD61þ)
based on the sorting strategy described in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Through limiting dilution transplantation of these populations,
we found that in MMTV-PyMT tumors, P1, P2, and P3 populations have increased tumor-initiating ability relative to P0, which
are the bulk of tumor cells (Fig. 1E). This shows that both ALDHþ
and CD29hiCD61þ populations in MMTV-PyMT tumors are
enriched for BCSCs, but the overlapping P3 population does not
display a further increase in tumor-initiating potential. Moreover,
the tumors formed from each of the populations recapitulated
the histologic features, growth rates as well as ﬂow cytometry
proﬁles of parental tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2D). The
tumors that form from respective sorted populations also
display continuous activation of BCSC-associated pathways,
namely, p-Stat3 (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and p-Smad2 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Contrastingly, in Wnt1-driven tumors,
we found that the CD29hiCD61þ population was most tumorigenic, whereas the ALDHþ population was least tumorigenic
(Fig. 1F). However, the tumors that developed in the recipient
mice also showed similar features as examined by histology,
tumor growth, and ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2E–
S2H). Together, these results demonstrate that ALDHþ and
CD29hiCD61þ markers identify distinct populations of BCSCs
in MMTV-PyMT tumors, whereas mammary tumors driven by
the Wnt1 oncogene primarily contain BCSCs enriched by
CD29hiCD61þ but ALDHþ is not a suitable marker for this
subtype of breast cancer.
CD29hiCD61þ tumor-initiating cells have enhanced invasive
and mesenchymal properties
As ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ both enriched for BCSCs in
MMTV-PyMT tumors, we further investigated whether these two
distinct BCSC populations have different characteristics. ALDHþ
and CD29hiCD61þ enriched BCSCs as well as those cells positive
for both sets of markers showed no statistical differences for
Ki67 staining, but all these three populations had less actively
cycling cells compared with the bulk tumor cells (Fig. 2A). In
contrast to the comparable lower proliferation rates for both
ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs, CD29hiCD61þ (as well as

Wnt tumors also exhibited invasive and mesenchymal features
(Fig. 2E and F)but were not enriched in BCSCs (Fig. 1F),
possibly representing an intermediate between CD29hiCD61þ
BCSCs (P1) and non CSCs.
To characterize the different BCSC populations in PyMT tumors
in more detail, we performed RNA-sequencing experiments to
identify differentially expressed genes between CD29hiCD61þ
BCSCs (P1), ALDHþ BCSCs (P2), and the bulk tumor cells
(P0). Interestingly, the differentially expressed genes illustrate a
hierarchical difference between these populations, similar to
differences observed in the hierarchy of normal MECs (28).

Comparison of CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs (P1) with bulk tumor
cells (P0) identiﬁes the P1 population as being more MSC like
(Fig. 2G). On the other hand, ALDHþ BCSCs (P2) had a gene
expression that is more associated with both MSC and LPs when
compared with P0 (Fig. 2G), suggesting that these cells may have
features associated with primitive LPs. Direct comparison of the
two BCSC populations, P2 with P1, indicates that P2 BCSCs are
more LP like and P1 BCSCs are more MSC-like (Fig. 2G). Altogether, these ﬁndings illustrate the existence of distinct BCSC
populations with differing hierarchical/EMT states in PyMT
tumors. Namely, CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs were more MSC-like,

closely associated with LPs and relatively less invasive.
Autophagy inhibition by FIP200 deletion impairs the tumorinitiating potential of ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ CSCs in
MMTV-PyMT tumors
Autophagy has been shown to play both tumor-suppressive
and tumor-promoting functions under different contexts (12).
We recently found that inhibition of autophagy by deletion of
FIP200 (Rb1cc1), an essential gene for autophagy induction,
decreased tumor development, and progression in MMTVPyMT–driven mammary tumors (14). To examine whether autophagy contributes to the tumorigenicity of these tumors through
regulation of the two BCSC populations with differing characteristics, we analyzed ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs in MMTVPyMT tumors with conditional knockout of FIP200 driven by
MMTV-Cre (herein referred to as cKO-MT tumors; ref. 14). We
found comparable levels of ALDHþ cells in Ctrl-MT and cKO-MT
tumors (Fig. 3A), suggesting that autophagy is not important in
the maintenance of ALDHþ BCSCs. However, a signiﬁcant
decrease in CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs was observed in cKO-MT
tumors (Fig. 3B). To ensure that the reduced BCSC content was
caused by intrinsic defects of FIP200-null tumor cells, we also
examined our newly developed FIP200f/f;PyMT;CreER mammary
tumor cells (23) following 4-OHT treatment to induce FIP200
deletion in vitro. The degree of autophagy inhibition in 4-OHT–
treated cells is illustrated by p62 accumulation and inhibition of
LC3 I conversion to LC3 II under both normal and sphere culture
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). We found that deletion of
FIP200 in these cells did not affect the percentage of ALDHþ
BCSCs, but signiﬁcantly reduced CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs compared
with the isogenic (vehicle-treated) control cells (Fig. 3C and D).
To further investigate whether FIP200 deletion affects self-renewal
and tumorigenicity of BCSCs in vivo, ALDHþ, CD29hiCD61þ or
bulk cKO-MT (i.e., FIP200f/f;PyMT;CreER mammary tumor cells
treated with 4-OHT) and Ctrl-MT (i.e., vehicle-treated FIP200f/f;
PyMT;CreER mammary tumor cells) tumor cells were transplanted at limiting dilutions into mammary fat pads of recipient
nude mice and monitored for tumorigenesis. Whereas ALDHþ
and CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs from Ctrl-MT mice generated tumors
in the majority of recipient mice, ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ
BCSCs from cKO-MT mice only induced tumor formation in a

small fraction of recipients (Fig. 3E). Bulk tumor cells from cKOMT and Ctrl-MT mice also only generated tumors in a smaller
fraction of recipients, although a statistically signiﬁcant reduction
was also observed in cKO-MT tumor cells. These results indicate
that autophagy plays a role in regulating the tumorigenicity of
both ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ BCSC populations.
It was interesting to note that FIP200 deletion did not alter the
percentage of ALDHþ cells but it decreased the tumor-initiating
potential of this population (Fig. 3A, C, and E). One possible
explanation for this observation is that ALDHþ BCSC characteristics but not ALDH enzymatic activity is dependent on FIP200.
However, in breast cancers and normal mammary LP cells, the
predominant ALDH isoform expressed is Aldh1a3 and the expression of this speciﬁc isoform has been implicated with BCSC traits
(29–31). In the Aldeﬂuor assay that we used to sort ALDHþ
populations, cells were distinguished on the basis of the enzymatic activity of ALDH isoforms that are sensitive to the inhibitor
DEAB. There is evidence to indicate that the Aldeﬂuor assay can
also detect ALDH2 activity and this lack of speciﬁcity may explain
the discrepancy we observed (32). Indeed, we found that FIP200
deletion signiﬁcantly decreased Aldh1a3 mRNA levels (Fig. 3F)
and this correlated with the decreased tumor-initiating potential
of ALDHþ cells from cKO-MT tumors (Fig. 3E). Conversely, Aldh2
levels were increased (Fig. 3F) and contributed signiﬁcantly to
Aldeﬂuor assay activity, speciﬁcally in cKO-MT tumors (Fig. 3G).
This is illustrated by the reduction of Aldeﬂuor activity in the
presence of an Aldh2 inhibitor, Daidzin, in cKO-MT but not CtrlMT cells. Together, these results demonstrate that inhibition of
autophagy by FIP200 deletion reduced the CSC-associated isoform of ALDH (Aldh1a3) and tumor-initiating potential of
ALDHþ BCSCs.
FIP200 deletion diminishes TGFb/Smad signaling that is
necessary for the CD29hiCD61þ CSC phenotype
Given the recent studies suggesting a role of EMT in promoting
characteristics of BCSCs (8), we wondered whether autophagy
may regulate CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs through EMT-inducing pathways. To examine such a possibility, we explored potential
changes in TGFb signaling, which is a well-described EMT-inducing pathway. We found that while TGFb1 exhibited comparable
levels in cKO-MT and Ctrl-MT cells, TGFb2 and TGFb3 mRNA
levels were signiﬁcantly decreased in cKO-MT cells (Fig. 4A).

Regulation of Distinct Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Autophagy

Moreover, we observed a concomitant decrease in Smad2/3
activation in FIP200-null tumor cells compared with control
tumor cells (Fig. 4B). To further validate the role of TGFb/Smad
signaling in the regulation of the distinct BCSC populations, we
silenced Smad4 in control tumor cells and found that the percentage of CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs was diminished (Fig. 4C and D).
The tumor-initiating potential of CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs was also
impaired upon Smad4 knockdown, as indicated by limiting
dilution transplant experiments (Table 1). Interestingly, knockdown of Smad4 did not alter the percentage of ALDHþ cells,
Aldh1A3 transcript levels or their tumor-initiating potential signiﬁcantly (Fig. 4E and F; Table 1). Addition of recombinant TGFb
restored the decreased content of CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs in cKOMT cells to a comparable level as in Ctrl-MT cells (Fig. 4G–I),
suggesting that deﬁcient TGFb signaling after FIP200 deletion is
responsible for the reduced CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs in these
cells. Consistent with a lack of effect of Smad4 knockdown on
ALDHþ BCSCs, treatment with recombinant TGFb did not
increase the ALDHþ population (but rather decreased it
slightly; Fig. 4I). These results suggest that autophagy plays an
important role in the maintenance of CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs but
not ALDHþ BCSCs through TGFb/Smad signaling.
FIP200 deletion impairs Stat3 activation, which is essential for
the tumor-initiating potential of ALDHþ cells
We next investigated whether altered Stat3 signaling is responsible for the decreased tumorigenicity of ALDHþ BCSCs upon
deletion of FIP200, as both the BCSC properties and Aldh1a3
levels of ALDHþ cells can be regulated by Stat3 signaling (33, 34).
In FIP200 cKO-MT cells, we observed decreased p-Stat3 levels
(Fig. 5A), suggesting that FIP200 is required to sustain Stat3
signaling in PyMT cells. IL6/Jak2 pathway has been implicated
in the regulation of BCSCs (9, 35). However, we did not observe

changes in Jak2 activation, but detected a slightly decreased level
of Socs3 in cKO-MT cells, excluding their possible role in mediating the reduced Stat3 signaling in these cells. Interestingly, we
found that both phospho Egfr and total Egfr levels were decreased
in these cells, raising the possibility that FIP200 regulates Stat3
through Egfr. To further explore this possibility, we examined
Stat3 signaling and Aldh1a3 levels upon silencing Egfr in Ctrl-MT
cells. We found that knockdown of Egfr led to decreased p-Stat3
and Aldh1a3 transcript levels, indicating that Egfr is a major
stimulus for Stat3 activation in these cells (Fig. 5B and C).
Moreover, ectopic expression of wild-type Egfr in cKO-MT cells
was sufﬁcient to elevate Stat3 phosphorylation and Aldh1a3
transcript levels (Fig. 5D and E). The requirement for Stat3 in
the regulation of Aldh1a3 and tumorigenicity of ALDHþ BCSCs
was also demonstrated by silencing of Stat3 in Ctrl-MT cells,
where cells transduced with sh1 Stat3 led to signiﬁcant reductions
in Aldh1a3 transcript levels (Fig. 5F and G) and tumor-initiating
potential in vivo (Table 1). Together, these results suggest that
deﬁcient Stat3 signaling is responsible for the reduced tumorinitiating capacity of ALDHþ BCSCs upon FIP200 deletion.
Combinatorial targeting of distinct BCSCs with Stat3 and
TGFbR inhibitors enhances therapeutic outcomes
Our above observations indicate that ALDHþ and CD29hi
CD61þ BCSCs that coexist in MMTV-PyMT tumors depend
on EGFR/Stat3 and TGFb/Smad signaling, respectively. These
ﬁndings have important implications because the differential
dependence could lead to therapeutic resistance and tumor
relapse if both populations are not effectively eliminated. As
such, we went on to address whether combinatorial targeting of
ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs with Stattic (Stat3 inhibitor)
and LY-2157299 (TGFbR1 inhibitor) can lead to better therapeutic responses. From colony-forming assays, we found that

Regulation of Distinct Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Autophagy

LY-2157299 in combination with Stattic led to a greater reduction in the number of colonies formed when compared with
either inhibitor alone (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, when the types of
colonies that formed were analyzed (Fig. 6B), we found that LY2157299 treatment resulted in formation of mostly epithelial
colonies, whereas Stattic treatment promoted the formation of
mesenchymal colonies (Fig. 6C). This observation is in line
with our ﬁnding that TGFb/Smad signaling promotes characteristics of mesenchymal BCSCs (CD29hiCD61þ) and Egfr/
Stat3 regulates the epithelial BCSC population (ALDHþ).
In a preclinical setting, the effects of combining these two
inhibitors were examined in vivo by treating transplanted PyMT
tumors in nude mice when the size of tumors was about 50 mm3
(Fig. 6D). Administration of either LY-2157299 or Stattic alone
did not result in signiﬁcant reductions in tumor volume (Fig. 6E).
However, the combination of both inhibitors impaired tumor
growth signiﬁcantly (Fig. 6E). After 21 days of treatment, the
percentage of CD29hiCD61þ and ALDHþ BCSCs were analyzed.
Tumors treated with LY-2157299 or the combination of inhibitors signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs
(Fig. 6F), an effect not seen in tumors treated with Stattic alone.
On the other hand, only cohorts that received Stattic or the
combination of drugs were effective in signiﬁcantly reducing
ALDHþ BCSCs (Fig. 6G). Tumors that were treated with Stattic
displayed dimished p-Stat3 staining, whereas tumors treated with
LY-2157299 had dimished p-Smad2 staining, illustrating the
efﬁcacy of respective inhibitors at the doses administered (Fig.
6H). These results indicate that the combination of LY-2157299
and Stattic may be more effective due to its ability to target both
CD29hiCD61þ and ALDHþ BCSCs, which depend on TGFb/Smad
and Stat3 signaling, respectively (Fig. 6I).

Discussion
The proposed CSC concept has played a signiﬁcant role in the
recent advance of cancer research, despite concerns on their
existence or utility in some cancers (7, 36, 37). In this study, we
describe for the ﬁrst time that ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ, two
widely used markers for BCSCs, enrich for two distinctive BCSC
populations with minimal overlap in one mouse model of breast
cancer, but that only CD29hiCD61þ markers enriched for BCSCs
in another model. These results suggest that various markers (even
those frequently employed) may not identify all CSCs, which may

contribute to some potential conﬂicting data concerning the
existence and/or role of CSCs.
Although sharing some common features like reduced proliferation compared with bulk tumor cells, CD29hiCD61þ and
ALDHþ BCSCs displayed differential properties with CD29hi
CD61þ BCSCs exhibiting increased invasive activity and expression of mesenchymal markers. Interestingly, these distinct BCSC
populations have expression proﬁles that are associated with
MSCs and LPs, respectively. The fact that both BCSC populations
have expression proﬁles associated with less differentiated cells in
the mammary cell hierarchy suggests that a dedifferentiation
process confers increased tumor-initiating potential, consistent
with the CSC hypothesis. However, due to different degrees of
dedifferentiation (i.e., MSC and LP), it is possible that BCSCs with
differing properties may exist within a tumor. These ﬁndings may
have potential clinical implications because it suggests that cells
with luminal and basal-like characteristics, respectively, may
coexist and that multiple disease subtypes that require different
treatment modalities may be present within a same tumor.
Accordingly, the two BCSC populations were found to be differentially reliant on separate signaling pathways. Stat3 inhibition
either through genetic or pharmacologic means decreased the
ALDHþ BCSCs and their tumor-initiating activities, but not
CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs, in MMTV-PyMT tumors. This agrees with
previous ﬁndings implicating a role for Stat3 in ALDHþ BCSCs of
breast and non–small cell lung tumors (33, 34, 38). Conversely,
CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs, but not ALDHþ BCSCs, were preferentially
inhibited by interfering with the TGFb/Smad pathway in MMTVPyMT tumors. It is notable that the markers used to isolate BCSCs
with more mesenchymal features in this study were CD29 (b1integrin) and CD61 (b3-integrin). The CD29 expression levels
distinguish high-expressing basal cells from low-expressing luminal cells. While CD61 has been initially characterized as a LP
marker in normal MECs of virgin female mice (27), more recently
CD29hiCD61þ cells have been shown to be pregnancy-associated
MSCs (39). Apart from being a putative BCSC marker in mouse
models (24, 26, 27), CD61 is a functional marker where its
expression has been shown to be regulated by TGFb2 and it
contributes to BCSC properties through regulation of the EMTassociated transcription factor Slug (39). Therefore, the dependence of CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs on the TGFb/Smad pathway could
possibly be due to the role of CD61 in regulating EMT-associated
pathways and stemness.

In further support of the different characteristics of the ALDHþ
and CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs, we found that while it affected both
BCSCs, which is consistent with a number of previous reports
(20, 21, 40), inhibition of autophagy by FIP200 deletion compromised ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs through defects in
the Stat3 and TGFb/Smad pathways, respectively. Regulation of
Stat3 by autophagy in breast cancer cells have been previously
reported and this can be mediated by IL6 secretion that is
controlled by autophagy-related proteins (18). However, secretion of IL6 was increased (data not shown), despite reduced pStat3 in FIP200-null MMTV-PyMT tumor cells. This indicates that
the regulation of IL6 secretion is context dependent and indeed
this was shown in a recent study comparing the effects of Atg7 or
Beclin1 knockdown in two breast cancer cell lines (40). In MCF7
cells, silencing of autophagy genes led to increased IL6 secretion,
whereas in MDA-MB-468 cells, the reverse was observed. It is also
worth noting that Atg5 deletion in HRasG12V transformed immortalized baby mouse kidney epithelial cells (iBMK) led to increased
IL6 secretion in the presence of inﬂammatory stimuli (41). In the
current study, however, the increased IL6 secretion upon FIP200
deletion does not contribute signiﬁcantly to Stat3 phosphorylation and we can attribute this to low levels of IL6RA expression.
On the other hand, we found that autophagy inhibition reduces
Stat3 activation through decreased EGFR levels in MMTV-PyMT
tumor cells. It is possible that autophagy inhibition leads to
accumulation of the autophagy adapter protein Cbl, a wellcharacterized ubiquitin ligase that promotes lysosomal degradation of EGFR (42, 43), resulting in enhanced EGFR degradation
and a consequent decrease in Stat3 activation after autophagy
inhibition.
Several lines of evidence have implicated a role for autophagy
in the regulation of EMT at separate levels. In hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines, starvation-induced autophagy could increase
TGFb levels which is required for induction of EMT and invasiveness (16). Apart from regulating TGFb cytokine levels, silencing of
autophagy-related genes has also been shown to impair TGFbinduced expression of vimentin and human BCSCs enriched by
CD24/CD44þ markers (29). In MMTV-PyMT tumor cells, we
observed that FIP200 deletion led to decreased TGFb2 and TGFb3
expression, suggesting that FIP200 regulates the TGFb/Smad
pathway at least in part through TGFb2 and TGFb3 transcript
levels. The fact that TGFb1 levels were not affected upon FIP200
deletion in these cells suggests that autophagy governs the activity
of a transcription factor that can bind to TGFb2 and TGFb3
promoters but not the TGFb1 promoter. In view of that, cyclic
AMP–responsive elements (CRE) which can be bound by CREB/
Atf1 transcription factors have been described in promoter regions
of just TGFb2 and TGFb3 but not TGFb1 (44). It will be interesting
to investigate these intermediate mechanisms as cross-regulation
between autophagy and CREB is possible (45).
We have shown that autophagy can regulate the separate pathways utilized by distinct BCSCs but it does not occur at critical
nodes within the respective signaling cascades. From the mechanisms by which autophagy regulate BCSCs that we have shown in
this study, it is possible that some redundancies may exist. For
instance, paracrine TGFb secretion by other cell types within the
tumor microenvironment may be sufﬁcient to bypass the need for
autophagy in CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs. As for the Stat3 pathway,
activation by IL6 rather than EGFR may compensate for the
maintenance of ALDHþ BCSCs. For that reason, we explored the
potential of combining inhibitors which can target nodes in the

3408 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

TGFb and Stat3 pathways, respectively. As we showed that ALDHþ
BCSCs were more epithelial and dependent on Egfr/Stat3 signaling, it is coherent that Stattic treatment led to decreased epithelial
colonies and enrichment of mesenchymal colonies in colonyforming assays in vitro. On the other hand, LY-2157299 was
effective in diminishing the number of mesenchymal colonies,
concordant with our ﬁndings that CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs are
dependent on the TGFb/Smad pathway. The heterogeneity that
is present due to the existence of distinct BCSCs is likely to
exacerbate therapeutic resistance. This is illustrated by the limited
effectiveness of either LY-2157299 or Stattic alone on both BCSC
populations. The decreased tumor growth in vivo and reduction of
both ALDHþ as well as CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs was only achieved
when LY-2157299 was used in combination with Stattic.
The drug combination studies were carried out in a T-cell–
deﬁcient setting and this nulliﬁes a substantial portion of the
systemic effects of these inhibitors on immunosuppression. While
this is beneﬁcial in helping us address the effects of Stattic and LY2157299 in combination on distinct BCSCs, it is possible that
additional therapeutic responses can be obtained with this drug
combination in an immune competent setting because the inhibitors used target pathways that are important for immunosuppressive cells (46, 47). It would be interesting to test both
potential immunotherapies, Stattic and LY-2157299, in combination in an immune competent setting.
It is worth noting that upon transplantation of the sorted
populations, the tumors that arise have similar histology, recapitulate marker proﬁles of parental tumors and display continuous activation of CSC-related pathways (Supplementary Figs. S2
and S3). This indicates that the characteristics of sorted populations are not due to permanent changes at the genetic level and
there is plasticity between the different BCSC populations as well
as the bulk tumor cells.
Recent studies in human breast cancers showed that CD24/
CD44þ BCSCs are associated with the basal-like phenotype,
whereas ALDHþ cells correlate with luminal tumor subtypes
(10, 48). Moreover, CD24/CD44þ BCSCs also display EMTassociated features in human breast tumors (10). Although
CD24/CD44þ markers are not applicable in mouse models
(49), the CD29hiCD61þ markers we used in this study enriches
for a BCSC population that is more invasive and express higher
levels of EMT-associated genes. We also found that this population can expand after TGFb treatment, suggesting that it is a
mesenchymal BCSC population similar to CD24/CD44þ BCSCs
described in human tumors and CD29hiCD61þ (48) can be
utilized in immune-competent mouse models of breast cancer
to identify mesenchymal BCSCs. On the other hand, while several
previous reports indicate that IL6/Stat3 signaling can regulate the
more mesenchymal CD24/CD44þ BCSC population in human
breast cancer cells (9, 35), we only observed a marginal effect on
the tumorigenicity of the CD29hiCD61þ population after Stat3
knockdown, albeit not signiﬁcantly. On the basis of our observations that Stat3 activation is sustained by EGFR and not through
IL6/Jak2 in MMTV-PyMT tumor cells, it is possible that these
differences are due to additional IL6 downstream signals that are
not induced by the EGFR pathway. We also cannot exclude the
possibility that CD29hiCD61þ cells are not a direct correlate for
CD24/CD44þ cells, despite both of these populations being
mesenchymal BCSCs.
BCSCs, deﬁned as cells which are less differentiated and more
tumorigenic than the bulk population, can possibly represent

Regulation of Distinct Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Autophagy

distinct entities depending on the cell of origin and the degree as
well as direction of dedifferentiation (7). The characterization of
these distinct BCSC populations in the MMTV-PyMT tumors
provides support to the idea that multiple BCSC/progenitor-like
populations with differing states on the EMT spectrum can be
present and contribute to the heterogeneity within breast tumors
(7). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time in which distinct
coexisting BCSC populations have been described in the highly
metastatic MMTV-PyMT model and this allows the study of these
distinct entities in an immune-competent host. Accordingly, this
is advantageous when investigating immune system–modulated
niches that regulate these heterogeneous BCSC populations and
whether BCSCs exhibit unique immune tolerance or resistance to
immune therapies (50).
On the whole, our ﬁndings support the notion that distinct
BCSCs with differing characteristics and susceptibility to therapies
can coexist within tumors. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to consider CSCs as a single entity. While we have described
ALDHþ and CD29hiCD61þ BCSCs and their differences in PyMT
tumors, we have not exhausted and addressed all reported BCSC
markers in our models and such a systematic effort may unravel
higher degrees of complexity. With a better understanding of the
heterogeneity and the speciﬁc susceptibility of varying subpopulations, therapeutic combinations may then be utilized to prevent
drug resistance.
