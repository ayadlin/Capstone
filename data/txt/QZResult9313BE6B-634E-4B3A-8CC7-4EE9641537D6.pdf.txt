Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) play important roles in tumorigenesis. Genetic variations in miRNA processing genes and
miRNA binding sites may affect the biogenesis of miRNA and the regulatory effect of miRNAs to their target genes,
hence promoting tumorigenesis. This study analyzed 226 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in miRNA
processing genes and miRNA binding sites in 339 ovarian cancer cases and 349 healthy controls to assess association
with cancer risk, overall survival, and treatment response. Thirteen polymorphisms were found to have significant
association with risk. The most significant were 2 linked SNPs (r2 ¼ 0.99), rs2740351 and rs7813 in GEMIN4 [odds
ratio (OR) ¼ 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57–0.87 and OR ¼ 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57–0.88, respectively].
Unfavorable genotype analysis showed the cumulative effect of these 13 SNPs on risk (P for trend < 0.0001).
Potential higher order gene–gene interactions were identified, which categorized patients into different risk groups
according to their genotypic signatures. In the clinical outcome study, 24 SNPs exhibited significant association
with overall survival and 17 SNPs with treatment response. Notably, patients carrying a rare homozygous genotype
of rs1425486 in PDGFC had poorer overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 2.69; 95% CI, 1.67–4.33] and worse treatment
response (OR ¼ 3.38; 95% CI, 1.39–8.19), compared to carriers of common homozygous and heterozygous
genotypes. Unfavorable genotype analyses also showed a strong gene-dosage effect with decreased survival
and increased risk of treatment nonresponse in patients with greater number of unfavorable genotypes (P for trend
< 0.0001). Taken together, miRNA-related genetic polymorphisms may impact ovarian cancer predisposition and
clinical outcome both individually and jointly. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9765–76. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in
women in the United States. Approximately, 21,000 new cases
and 15,000 new deaths are expected each year (1). Greater
than 80% of patients at the time of diagnosis were of advanced
stage with the majority surviving less than 5 years. The
relatively high mortality and little progress in improving
survival rates within the past few decades call for better
methods of treatment, diagnosis, and prevention. Known risk
factors for ovarian cancer include family or personal history of
cancer (breast or ovarian), age over 55, never pregnant, and
history of hormone replacement therapy. Linkage to family

history suggests that there is a genetic component to ovarian
cancer predisposition. Indeed, known hereditary risk factors
include BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations (2) and also mutations in
mismatch repair genes such as hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, PMS1
and PMS2 (3). However, the influence of common genetic
polymorphisms on ovarian cancer risk has not been well
studied.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small, noncoding RNA
molecules 22 nucleotide in length. They regulate gene
expression by targeting mRNA transcripts for degradation
or translational repression. It is estimated that one third of
the human mRNA transcripts might be miRNA targets (4). The
involvement of miRNAs in cancer has been firmly established.
The expression of many miRNA genes is deregulated in
various types of human cancer. Dysregulation of miRNA
transcription, copy numbers, biogenesis, or processing pathways has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis in
humans and animal models (5–7). Genetic variants of the
miRNA have been suggested to modify the risk of several
cancers such as bladder, esophageal, and renal cancer (8–10).
MiRNAs are synthesized as large pre-miRNA transcripts by
RNA polymerase II in the nucleus and then processed by the
RNase III enzyme Drosha and its cofactor DCRG8 (Pasha) to
release the 70-nt pre-miRNAs, which are exported out of the
nucleus by a protein complex containing Exportin 5 (11). Once
in the cytoplasm, pre-miRNA precursors are further processed

by the RNase III Dicer to form the 22-nt miRNA duplex.
Because each miRNA might regulate as many as 200 genes,
identifying the risk factors associated with miRNA genes
might uncover novel pathways and mechanisms of pathogenesis. We hypothesized that polymorphisms of miRNA-related
genes might modulate ovarian cancer risk. In this report, we
investigated 238 SNPs from 8 miRNA processing genes and 134
genes containing potential miRNA binding sites for ovarian
cancer predisposition and association with clinical outcome
and treatment response. To our knowledge, this is the first
large-scale investigation of the association between miRNA
pathway polymorphisms and ovarian cancer risk and clinical
outcome.

Materials and Methods
Study population
The subjects recruited for this study were enrolled from
August 1991 to January 2009. For cases, newly diagnosed and
histologically confirmed ovarian cancer patients were
recruited at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston. Controls were healthy individuals without
prior history of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) and
recruited in parallel with the cases from a large pool of
individuals seeing a physician for routine health checkups or
addressing health concerns at the Kelsey–Seybold Clinic, a
large private multispecialty physician group in the Houston
metropolitan area, which consists of 20 clinics and more than
300 physicians. There was no restriction on recruitment criteria for age, ethnicity, or clinical stage. Both cases and controls
were prospectively recruited and matched by age (5 years),
gender, and ethnicity. To minimize population admixture, only
non-Hispanic Caucasian individuals were included in the
analysis. Demographic and epidemiology information, including age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and history, height,
weight, and body mass index were collected for all subjects.
SNP selection and genotyping
Details of the SNP selection and genotyping have been
described previously (12). In brief, we have generated a
customized panel of cancer-related genes involved in major
cellular signaling pathways, including those in the miRNA
biogenesis pathway, using Illumina's iSelect platform. Priority
score was assigned to each gene on the basis of query of Gene
Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org/), a comprehensive
database of gene annotation and literature review. For genes
with high priority scores, database mining of dbSNP (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/), International HapMap
Project (http://www.hapmap.org/), and miRBase registry
(http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/) identified potential functional and tagging SNPs in the miRNA biogenesis
pathway. Functional SNPs were defined as those located in the
coding regions and regulatory regions (promoter, splicing
site, 50 -UTR, and 30 -UTR). SNPs containing potential miRNA
binding site were interrogated using PolymiRTS database
(http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miRSNP/). LDSelect program
(http://droog.gs.washington.edu/ldSelect.html) was used to
separate SNPs into bins on the basis of linkage disequilibrium.

Selected tagging SNPs have an r2 threshold of 0.8, minor allele
frequency (MAF) greater than 0.01 in Caucasian population
and are located within 10 kb upstream of transcriptional start
site and 10 kb downstream of transcriptional end site. A
complete set of SNPs was sent to Illumina technical support
for custom iSelect, Infinium II BeadChip design using a
proprietary program developed by Illumina. Genomic DNA
was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using
QIAmp DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and genotyped according
to the standard protocol provided by Illumina. Genotypes
were autocalled using the BeadStudio software.
Luciferase reporter assay to determine effect of miRNA
binding on PDGFC expression
A reporter construct derived from pGL3 (Ambion) containing the entire 30 UTR region of PDGFC was generated as
follows. A 1.7-kb fragment of PDGFC 30 UTR was amplified
from genomic DNA using the following primer sequences:
forward Pr1 50 -TCACTCACCGACGTGGCCCT; reverse Pr1 50 AGGCAGAGAAGGCTCACAGGT. Subsequently, nested PCR
was performed using the cloning primers: forward Pr2 50 GAATCTAGACCGCATCACCACCAGCAG; reverse Pr2 50 GAAGGCCGGCCAAAATAGCCACATTCT. The amplified product was digested with XbaI and FseI restriction enzymes
(New England Biolabs) and subcloned into similarly digested
pGL3 vector 30 to the luciferase gene. Reporter construct
containing the variant PDGFC allele was constructed through
site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange protocol
(Stratagene). OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell line (kindly provided by Dr. Mien-Chie Hung of MD Anderson Cancer Center
in June 2010) was cultured in DMEM F12 with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen). Cells were devoid of Mycoplasma contamination and characterized by short tandem repeat DNA
fingerprinting by the Characterized Cell Line Core facility at
MD Anderson in August 2010. The cell line was a match with
known STR profile for OVCAR3 at all loci tested. OVCAR3 cells
were cultured in 48-well tissue culture plates and transfected
with 0.5 mg of wild-type or variant PDGFC reporter construct
along with 5 pmol of negative control (scrambled sequence) or
miR-425 RNA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 8 ng of pGL4 (Ambion)
Renilla luciferase reporter using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 36 hours. Reporter expression was analyzed using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and
measured in a FLUOstar Optima microplate reader (BMG
Labtech). Each assay was carried out in 4 replicates.
Statistical analysis
Differences in patient characteristics and SNP genotypes
were assessed by Pearson c2 or Fisher's exact tests. Student's t
test was used for continuous variables to examine the differences between cases and controls. Among the control subjects, the c2 test for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was applied
to each SNP. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)
were estimated by unconditional multivariate logistic regression while adjusting for age. The most significant test among
the 3 genetic models (dominant, recessive, and additive)
was used to determine the statistical significance of each
SNP. Haplotypes for each individual were inferred using the

MicroRNA Polymorphisms and Ovarian Cancer Risk and Survival

HelixTree software (v6.4.3, Golden Helix) and were included in
the analysis when the probabilities of certainty were at least
95%. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis by
HelixTree software (v6.4.3, Golden Helix) was used to explore
higher order gene–gene interactions and classify subjects into
distinct risk groups. Kaplan–Meier plots and log-rank test were
applied to assess differences in overall survival by genotypes
from each SNP, which was calculated from the start date of
treatment to the date of death or the end of patient follow-up.
Hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival were estimated by
applying the Cox proportional hazards model while adjusting
for age, clinical stage, histology, and treatment regimen. For
response to chemotherapy, unconditional multivariate logistic
regression analysis was performed while adjusting for age,
clinical stage, histology, and treatment regimen. Treatment
response was defined by whether there was evidence of residual disease as indicated by various clinical measures, such as
positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans, second-look surgery, and postchemo CA-125
level. In addition, patients who died during the follow-up
period were considered poor responders. For those SNPs in
linkage disequilibrium, we chose the SNP with the smallest P
value to be included in the model. Cumulative effects of
multiple variants were analyzed by counting the number of
unfavorable genotypes identified from the main effects analysis
of single SNPs (P < 0.05). The unfavorable genotypes were
collapsed into 3 groups (low-, medium-, and high-risk) according to the tertile distribution of the number of unfavorable
genotypes. The reference group was that with the lowest risk.
STATA software (version 10, STATA Corporation) was used for
the above analyses. To control for multiple testing, q value [a
false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value] was calculated for
each SNP implemented in the R-package. All P values reported
were 2-sided.

Caucasian cases and controls. We discarded 12 SNPs that
showed significant departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.01) or MAF less than 1%. From the remaining
SNPs, 13 were significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk
(Table 1). The strongest associations were seen in 2 linked
SNPs in the GEMIN4 gene, rs2740351 (OR ¼ 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57–
0.87) and rs7813 (Cys1033Arg; OR ¼ 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57–0.88),
using the best fitting additive model. Another nonsynonymous
SNP (nsSNP) in GEMIN4 (rs2740349, Asp929Asn) was also
significantly associated with decreased ovarian cancer risk
(OR ¼ 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96). Four other SNPs exhibited
considerably reduced risk in a dominant model. The remaining 6 SNPs, all located within potential miRNA binding sites,
demonstrated significant association with elevated ovarian
cancer risk, such as rs17147016 (UGT2A3, OR ¼ 1.47; 95% CI,
1.08–2.01), rs7499 (COL18A1, OR ¼ 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08–2.01),
rs3917328 (IL1R1, OR ¼ 1.65; 95% CI, 1.03–2.64), and
rs10771184 (KRAS, OR ¼ 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01–1.57). The smallest
q values for these SNPs were 0.112 for the 2 most significant
GEMIN4 SNPs.

Results

CART analysis of miRNA pathway polymorphisms
We then used CART analysis to explore the gene–gene
interactions in modulating ovarian cancer risk (Fig. 1). There
were 6 terminal nodes constructed from interactions among
rs5973822 (ATG4A), rs2740351 (GEMIN4), rs10771184 (KRAS),
rs7499 (COL18A1), and rs9920 (CAV1). Using individuals of
terminal node 1 as the reference, the ORs for other terminal
nodes ranged from 1.22 (node 2) to 4.76 (node 6). We further
categorized these nodes into 3 groups of low- (nodes 1 and 2),
medium- (nodes 3 and 4), and high-risk (nodes 5 and 6).
Compared with the low-risk group, the ORs for the mediumand high-risk groups were 1.85 (95% CI, 1.28–2.68) and 3.97
(95% CI, 2.61–6.04), respectively. In general, subjects carrying
heterozygous or homozygous variant alleles of ATG4A
(rs5973822) were associated with the lowest risk for ovarian
cancer, whereas those heterozygous or homozygous for the
variant alleles of KRAS (rs10771184) or CAV1 (rs9920) had the
highest risk.

Subject characteristics
A total of 417 case subjects and 417 controls were recruited,
of which 339 cases (81.3%) and 349 controls (83.7%) were
Caucasians (Supplementary Table S1). The mean age for cases
and controls was 60.7 and 60.3 years, respectively. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls for
age (P ¼ 0.554) and ethnicity (P ¼ 0.269). For clinical outcome
analyses, we only considered cases who had received surgery
and platinum-based chemotherapy to minimize treatment
effects on survival. Among this group, 87% of the subjects were
diagnosed with advanced stage (III, IV) ovarian cancer. The
majority of tumors biopsied were of the serous subtype (62%),
similar to previously reported prevalence (13). The median
survival time (MST) was 48.3 months with the median age of 61
years (range, 26–88). Slightly less than half of the patients had
died at the end of the follow-up period with 48% showing
cancer recurrence and 33% being nonresponders to treatment.
Risk association of individual SNPs
We analyzed 238 SNPs from 8 miRNA processing genes and
134 potential miRNA binding sites in cancer-related genes in

www.aacrjournals.org

Haplotype analysis of GEMIN4 SNPs
Because 3 of the GEMIN4 SNPs exhibited strong association
with ovarian cancer risk, we performed a haplotype analysis of
all 6 genotyped GEMIN4 SNPs (Supplementary Table S2).
Using the wild-type alleles of all 6 SNPs as reference, the
haplotype containing the variant alleles of the 3 significant
SNPs (rs274035, rs7813, and rs2740349; M_M_M_W_W_W)
showed the strongest protective effect on ovarian cancer (OR
¼ 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.86, P ¼ 0.004). A second haplotype
containing the variant alleles of rs274035, rs7813, and 2 other
SNPs (M_M_W_W_M_M) was also associated with a significantly reduced ovarian cancer risk (OR ¼ 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51–
0.94; P ¼ 0.018).

SNPs associated with overall survival and treatment
response
Out of 226 miRNA pathway SNPs examined, 24 were
significantly associated with ovarian cancer survival

(Table 2) with the most significant SNP being in the PDGFC
gene (rs1425486, HR ¼ 2.69; 95% CI, 1.67–4.33; recessive
model), which remained significant after adjusting for
multiple testing (q ¼ 0.004). Other SNPs among the top 5
included those in SNAI1 (rs1047920, HR ¼ 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30–
2.97; dominant model), TLR (rs7869402, HR ¼ 2.16; 95% CI,
1.31–3.57; dominant model), and DGCR8 (rs3757, HR ¼ 2.76;
95% CI, 1.30–5.84; recessive model). Interestingly, the variant
allele of the KRAS SNP (rs10771184) was associated with
increased survival (OR ¼ 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38–0.84; dominant
model).
Analysis of the miRNA-related SNPs for treatment outcome
revealed 17 SNPs that had significant association, including
rs12190214 in ALDH5A1 (OR ¼ 2.60; 95% CI, 1.31–5.14),
rs2248718 in ATP6V1C1 (OR ¼ 2.12; 95% CI, 1.19–3.78), and
rs12226697 in SIRT3 (OR ¼ 3.30; 95% CI, 1.29–8.45; Table 3).
Except for the intronic SNP of RNASEN (rs17408716), all the
significant SNPs were located in potential miRNA binding
sites. Notably, 3 of the significant SNPs were also significantly
associated with survival. Consistent with their higher death

risk, variant alleles of PDGFC (OR ¼ 3.38; 95% CI, 1.39–8.19)
and TLR4 (OR ¼ 3.49; 95% CI, 1.41–8.67) were associated with
poor treatment response. Similarly, the variant KRAS allele,
which showed reduced death risk, was associated with favorable treatment outcome (OR ¼ 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27–0.91).
Cumulative effects of unfavorable genotypes on ovarian
cancer risk and treatment response
To examine the cumulative effects of the miRNA-related
genetic variants on ovarian cancer risk, we performed unfavorable genotype analysis using the 12 SNPs that showed
significant association as previously (Table 4). Because
rs2740351 and rs7813 exhibited linkage, only the former
was included in the analysis. Compared with subjects in
the low-risk group as reference (5 unfavorable genotypes or
fewer), those in the medium-risk group (6–7 unfavorable
genotypes) and the high-risk group (8 unfavorable genotypes) had about 2- (OR ¼ 1.99; 95% CI, 1.38–2.87) and 4.5-fold
(OR ¼ 4.46; 95% CI, 2.83–7.02) increased risk of ovarian cancer,
respectively (P for trend ¼ 1.51  1011).

We also performed unfavorable genotype analysis of the
17 SNPs that are significantly associated with treatment
response (Table 5). Using 5 or fewer unfavorable genotypes
as reference, subjects with 6 and 7 or greater unfavorable
genotypes had 3.8-fold (OR ¼ 3.82; 95% CI, 1.73–8.43) and
more than 20-fold (OR ¼ 20.1; 95% CI, 9.17–44.2) increased
risk of not responding to treatment respectively (P for trend
¼ 8.92  1013).
Survival analysis of significant SNPs
We plotted Kaplan–Meier curves for the top 3 SNPs associated with survival (Figs. 2A–C). The homozygous variant
alleles of rs1425486 (A/A; PDGFC) and the heterozygous/
homozygous variant alleles of rs1047920 (GA/AA; SNAI1)
and rs7869402 (GA/AA; TLR4) were associated with shorter
MST. Their MSTs were 23.8, 28.0, and 34.9 months compared
with the MSTs of 53.1, 53.1, and 52.7 months for their reference
groups, respectively.

Unfavorable genotypes and cancer survival
The cumulative effect of unfavorable genotypes on ovarian
cancer survival is shown in Figure 2D. Four SNPs (rs1633445,
rs720014, rs8139591, rs10719) were in high linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs in the panel (Table 3) and were
discarded from the analysis. Using the low death risk group
of 8 or fewer unfavorable genotypes as reference, there was a
significant gene–dosage effect for medium-risk (9–10 unfavorable genotypes; HR ¼ 3.26; 95% CI, 1.92–5.52) and high-risk
(11 unfavorable genotypes) groups (HR ¼ 8.52; 95% CI, 4.90–
14.84; P trend ¼ 2.2  1016). The MST for the reference group
was 139 months versus 24.7 months for the high-risk group.
MiRNA binding site variant of PDGFC affects targeting
by miR-425
Because rs1425486 of the PDGFC gene showed the most
significant association with ovarian cancer survival, we
wanted to test whether the SNP in the putative miRNA binding

site influences targeting by miR-425 in vitro. We cloned the
entire 30 UTR of PDGFC gene containing the wild-type or
variant allele of rs1425486 into the pGL3 luciferase reporter
construct and then transfected the reporter along with control
or miR-425 RNA into OVCAR3 cells. We found that cotransfection of miR-425 significantly inhibited expression of the
reporter carrying the wild-type PGDFC (G) allele but not
the variant (A) allele (Supplementary Figure S1). This suggests
that the variant rs1425486 genotype could differentially affect
targeting by miR-425 in ovarian cancer cells leading to higher
PDGFC expression.

Discussion
Previous studies have shown the deregulation of miRNA or
miRNA-related genes in ovarian cancer (5, 14, 15). However,
the influence of low penetrance, common genetic variations in
the miRNA pathway genes on ovarian cancer predisposition
has not been extensively explored. Here, we show that SNPs in
miRNA processing genes and miRNA binding sites were
associated with ovarian cancer predisposition.

9772

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

Interestingly, 2 nsSNP (rs7813, Cys1033Arg and rs2740349,
Asn923 Asp) in GEMIN4 were among the top SNPs associated
with ovarian cancer predisposition. Several SNPs in GEMIN4
had been identified previously as having significant association with bladder, esophageal, and renal cell carcinoma risks
(7–9), indicating a more general role for GEMIN4 in modifying
cancer risk. GEMIN4 encodes a product that is a component of
a multiprotein complex localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm (16). It is a component of both miRNA–protein complex
(miRNP) and spliceosomal snRNA–protein complex (snRNP)
and may play multiple roles in vivo. Further, in vitro and in vivo
functional assays are necessary to dissect the mechanistic
basis for GEMIN4's risk association in ovarian cancer. Other
polymorphisms involving miRNA processing genes that
were found to be significantly associated with ovarian cancer
risk include those of XPO5 (Exportin 5, rs2257082), DDX20
(DEAD box protein, rs197383) and RNASEN (Drosha,
rs4867329). Interestingly, the variant alleles of all these SNPs
were associated with reduced cancer risk (Table 2), indicating
a common influence of these miRNA processing genes in
affecting tumorigenesis.

MicroRNA Polymorphisms and Ovarian Cancer Risk and Survival

We also identified 6 miRNA binding site variant SNPs in the
30 UTR of target genes that were associated with ovarian
cancer risk. With the exception of the ATG4A SNP, minor
variant of these SNPs were associated with elevated risk.
ATG4A encodes a cysteine protease involved in autophagy
(17). Reduced levels of autophagy have been described in some
malignant tumors and its role in controlling unregulated cell
growth has been proposed (18, 19). Because the variant allele
was associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk (Table 1), this
suggests that altered targeting by miRNA might elevate
ATG4A protein expression to confer protection from tumorigenesis. UGT2A3 is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, which are critical for the detoxification of numerous
drugs or environmental pollutants (20). A recent report indicated that genetic variants of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9, 2 other
members of this large enzyme family, were associated with
increased risk of colon cancer for patients with elevated
dietary intake of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (21). COL18A1 is a type XVIII collagen. The
proteolytically cleaved C-terminal fragment of this protein,
endostatin, is a potent antiangiogenic peptide investigated as
a potential cancer therapeutic. CAV1 encodes a multifunctional scaffolding protein that is found in cell-surface caveolae.
Cav1 might regulate cellular processes, such as transformation, tumor growth, migration, and metastasis, and has been
investigated as a potential marker in several types of cancers
(22). IL1R1 is a type 1 interleukin 1 receptor, which mediates
cytokine-induced inflammatory or immune response. The role
of inflammation in certain types of cancer predisposition has
been well established. Mutated KRAS has been implicated in
various malignancies including carcinomas of the lung, ovary,
pancreas, and colon (23–26). E2F2 encodes a member of E2F
transcription factor family, which plays a pivotal role in cell
cycle regulated by the retinoblastoma pathway. High expression of E2F2 was found in ovarian cancer cell lines as well as in
ovarian cancer patients with advanced histopathologic stage
(27). Taken together, there is strong biological plausibility for
the individual and joint association of these miRNA-targeted
genes and ovarian cancer risk.
We found 3 SNPs (located in PDGFC, TLR4, and KRAS) that
were significantly associated with survival and treatment
response. The strongest association was found in a variant
allele of PDGFC gene (rs1425486), which remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. PDGFC is a member
of the platelet-derived growth factor family, which encodes a
mitogenic factor for cells of mesenchymal origin. Recent
studies have linked PDGFC expression with chemoresistance to cisplatin in head and neck cancer and shown that
PDGFC expression by tumor-associated fibroblasts might
mediate tumor refractory effect to anti-VEGF treatment,
supporting the role of this gene in influencing ovarian cancer
and treatment response (28,29). In animal models, PDGFC
had been shown to promote tumor growth by activating and
recruiting cancer associated fibroblasts in the stroma and
might play a role in tumor progression (30). Rs1425486 is a
predicted binding site for miR-425, which is expressed at low
levels in the ovary (PolymiRTS database; microRNA expression database: http://www.microrna.org). The variant allele

www.aacrjournals.org

of this SNP is predicted to cause changes in the pairing of the
miRNA and its target transcript at the conserved binding
site. It has been reported that the expression of miR-425 and
other miRNAs is upregulated in the glioblastoma non–stem
cell (CD133) population and that transfection of these
miRNAs resulted in inhibition of neurosphere formation
(31). In our in vitro reporter assay, we demonstrated that
rs1425486 genotype could differentially affect miR-425 targeting in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that PDGFC is a
putative target for miR-425. Measurement of PDGFC expression in ovarian tissue in correlation with its genotype, as well
as more detailed fine mapping of the PDGFC gene may
further strengthen the association of this gene with ovarian
cancer clinical outcome.
TLR4 encodes a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)
family, which mediates pathogen recognition and activation of
innate immunity. Toll-like receptors, such as TLR4, are
expressed on immune cells and have vital function in host
immunity against foreign pathogens and in generating host
inflammatory response. It has been shown that several TLRs,
including TLR4, are also expressed on the surface epithelium
of normal ovaries, as well as malignant tumors (32). Ligation of
the TLRs led to the release of various cytokines, which could
trigger inflammatory response in the microenvironment.
Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that TLR activation could also promote tumor growth and metastasis. For
example, Szczepanski and colleagues. recently showed that in
tumor tissues obtained from head and neck cancer patients,
activation of TLR4 receptor enhanced tumor growth, protected cells from drug-induced apoptosis, and decreased
sensitivity of the tumor cells to immune lysis (33). At least
in these in vitro settings, TLR4 could facilitate tumor growth
and protect tumor cells from immune response. Intriguingly,
the variant allele of KRAS that was associated with increased
ovarian cancer risk also showed correlation with increased
survival (Tables 1, 4, and 5). This paradoxical observation is
not unprecedented. Previous compelling evidence has shown
that DNA repair plays a similar role in cancer risk and outcome, with suboptimal DNA repair capacity associated with
increased cancer risk but better treatment response and
survival in lung cancer patients (34–36).
For the association of the KRAS SNP with ovarian cancer
risk, survival, and treatment response, one possibility might be
that there is differential activity of the protooncogenic product by the 2 alleles, so that higher activity might be associated
with increased cancer risk but also predisposes the tumor cells
to better killing by platinum-based therapy, hence better
clinical outcome. Indeed, many DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents take advantage of the tumor cells’ proclivity to
proliferate to target them preferentially. Currently, there are
limited clinical data regarding the status of various cancerrelated genes, including KRAS, and their association with
survival or response to chemotherapy. More detailed functional studies may probe the underlying mechanism for the
association of common genetic variants of these genes and the
prognosis for ovarian cancer. Genetic changes involving KRAS
in ovarian malignancy have been substantiated by previous
studies (13, 37–41).

Liang et al.

For SNPs that are associated with overall survival only,
rs1047920 of SNAI1 is the most significant. SNAI1 is the human
homologue of the Drosophila transcription repressor gene,
Snai1, which is involved in mesoderm formation during
embryo development. In humans, Snail1 plays an important
role during epithelial–mesenchymal transition by downregulating E-cadherin expression, which may lead to cancer
progression (42). Confirming the validity of our data, a recent
study indicated that increased Snail expression was associated with decreased overall survival of ovarian cancer
patients (43).
Among the top 5 miRNA pathway SNPs that are associated
with treatment response only include those that are located in
ALDH5A1 (rs12190214), ATP6V1C1 (rs2248718), and SIRT3
(rs12226697). ALDH5A1 is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, which is involved in non-P450
enzyme metabolism of aldehydes generated by various endogenous and exogenous precursors including xenobiotic drugs
(44). Mutations of ALDH5A1 can result in g-hydroxybutyric
aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
neurologic and cognitive defects due to the accumulation of
g-hydroxybutyric acid. The influence of ALDH genes in the risk
and clinical outcome of some cancers has been reported
recently (45-47); although the role of each individual gene
in ovarian cancer predisposition and treatment response is
currently unknown. ATP6V1C1 encodes a component of the
vacuolar ATPase, which is important for vesicular proton
gradient generation. ATP6V1C1 has been found to be overly
expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma and is hypothesized to influence tumor development through changes in
intracellular pH regulation (48). SIRT3 is a member of sirtuin
gene family that is involved in NAD-dependent deacetylation.
SIRT3 is localized in the mitochondria, where it deacetylates
and activates acetyl-CoA synthetase. Recently, it has been
found that SIRT3 might be proapoptotic and participate in
basal apoptotic pathways (49). Overall, it is biologically plausible that polymorphisms in miRNA binding sites might affect
the expression of these metabolic genes, which in turn, may
influence response to chemotherapy.
The combined effects of the miRNA pathway polymorphisms on ovarian cancer risk, survival, and treatment response
were readily seen in the unfavorable genotype analyses, which
showed a trend toward increasing risk with increasing number
of unfavorable genotypes. This is consistent with the notion
that ovarian cancer is a polygenic disease involving multiple
risk factors, which can modify disease initiation, progression,
and outcome.
It is possible that some of the associations identified in
this study were due to chance finding. However, we tried to
minimize false discovery by matching our cases and controls
in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity and by calculating the
q value, which is an FDR-adjusted P value. On the basis of the
minimum FDR of 10%, several of the top SNPs were significant or at least borderline significant (Supplementary
Table S3). In addition, we have tested for disease heterogeneity in the cases by checking the proportional hazards
assumption on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals for the
histology subtype and did not observe significant departure

9774

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

from the assumption of proportionality (P ¼ 0.11) in our
data. Stratified analysis of top SNPs among serous carcinoma patients did not show significant changes in risk
estimates for overall survival and treatment response (Supplementary Table S4) suggesting they were not significantly
affected by disease heterogeneity.
There are other limitations to our study, such as the
relatively small sample size and the lack of complete family
history in some of the cases. Moreover, this is a hospitalbased case–control study and selection bias may exist, as
the controls from a clinic may not be ideal representatives
of the geographically matched population with similar
environmental exposure. However, MD Anderson serves
as a referral center for many cancer patients from the
Kelsey–Seybold system; therefore our controls are likely
to represent a similar population base to the cases.
Furthermore, because our research is entirely driven by
a genetic hypothesis, the use of population-based control is
not as critical as it may have been in classical studies of
disease and exposure. In addition, we recruited newly
diagnosed patients, which will limit potential survival bias.
Finally, the query for miRNA binding sites was done in
silico, so that caution should be taken regarding their
interpretation until confirmed by more detailed
functional assays, which might uncover the mechanistic
basis for the association of some of these polymorphisms
and ovarian tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the strengths of
this study include the well-characterized patient population with detailed clinical, treatment, and follow-up information, comprehensive query of tagging and functional
SNPs in the miRNA biosynthesis genes plus potential
miRNA binding sites in cancer-related pathways, the indepth analyses of single and joint association of these
genetic variants with ovarian cancer risk and treatment
response, as well as the original, functional characterization of one of the significant SNPs. These results support
the general hypothesis that genetic variants of the miRNArelated pathway could modify ovarian cancer risk and
clinical outcomes. Future replicated studies in independent populations are necessary to confirm our findings.
In summary, this is the first large-scale evaluation of germline genetic variants in miRNA-related genes in ovarian cancer. Individual and joint association of these polymorphisms
with ovarian cancer risk and clinical outcomes revealed novel
pathways for oncogenesis and might serve as potential biomarkers in a risk prediction model to guide cancer screening,
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
