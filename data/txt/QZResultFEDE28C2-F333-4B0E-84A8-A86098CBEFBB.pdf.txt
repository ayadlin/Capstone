Cancer: More of Polygenic Disease and Less of
Multiple Mutations? A Quantitative Viewpoint
Anders Bredberg, MD, PhD

The focus of cancer research is on cancer-specific mutations, with most clinical trials involving targeted drugs. Huge
numbers of DNA lesions and tumor resistance events, in each of the >1013 cells of a human individual, form a striking
contrast to the low, and also very narrow, cancer incidence window (101–100). A detailed consideration of these
quantitative observations seems to question the present paradigm, while suggesting that a systemic regulatory
network mechanism is a stronger determinant for overt cancer disease, as compared with cancer-specific gene products. If we shall ever achieve major improvements in survival, we must gain understanding of this systemic network,
rather than targeting therapy to a limited set of molecules or mutations. This may give us new opportunities for

KEYWORDS: cancer, cancer resistance, targeted therapy, carcinogenesis, prevention.

In a recent initiative to strengthen research on inhibitors of cancer-specific gene products, it was assumed that most cancers
go through an early phase driven by a single mutation, corresponding to the imatinib-sensitive stage of chronic myelogenous
leukemia.1 This would make the tumor, if identified early enough, suitable for targeted therapy. Other examples of the present focus in cancer research are reflected in a recent editorial advocating ‘‘a need to expand the scope of cancer research funding,’’ toward a clinical strategy to target putative DNA repair defects,2 and a statement by one of the 2009 Lasker Award
winners that ‘‘the challenges will be to determine what combinations of targeted therapies will work best.’’3
However, there has been skepticism regarding the mutation-centered model of cancer.4 The classical paper defining
the 6 hallmarks of cancer urged attention to systemic factors, especially the interaction between cancer cells and the tumor
stroma.5 Rubin has reinterpreted his findings on apparently unmutated tumors to acknowledge the omnipresence of
cancer-specific mutations. Nevertheless, he emphasizes the major impact on cancer by hierarchical relations among the
normal cells surrounding the tumor.6 Most recently, Brash and Cairns related classical animal experiments, with a single
genotoxic initiation step followed by a nonmutational promotion period, alerting the ‘‘readers to new developments that
could at least start to clarify what is going on during carcinogenesis.’’7
This commentary will outline some quantitative aspects of carcinogenesis, and then make the argument that these
could suggest a networktype of robust regulatory mechanism, in support of the skeptics.

Quantity of Cells
Despite a large genetic heterogeneity within each tumor, cancer is believed to be monoclonal with a single-cell origin. As a
human adult, on average, gets less than one cancer and has a total of 5  1013 nucleated cells,8 the probability that one of
all these cells will ever develop into a cancer is obviously small. This holds true even if cancer is assumed to originate from
stem cells, as their number may be approximated to >108 in a human adult, as deduced from the 109 CD34þ hematopoietic progenitor cells becoming mobilized from the bone marrow into peripheral blood as part of clinical stem cell transplantation9 (Fig. 1).
Although the cancer frequency in wild animal populations is a controversial issue, one can be certain there is no
cancer excess in larger mammals such as the blue whale, composed of 1017 cells, as compared with its smallest mammal
relative (a bat) with 109 cells. A mouse makes up as little as 0.001 the size of a human body.

Tumors are relatively inefficient in forming metastasis and fulfilling the criteria of a cancer. Microchip technology has computed the concentration of circulating
tumor cells in many common cancer forms to >100/ml
blood,10 supporting assumptions that as many as 108
tumor cells must enter the circulation for a clinically
relevant metastasis to form.8

Quantity of DNA Damage
Some examples of very high numbers of DNA damage,
estimated to lead to 3  1016 mutations during a human

mate activity of the V(D)J recombinase, breaking nonimmune gene sequences, is hard to quantify, but large
numbers are likely because one of its products, the
t(14;18) chromosome rearrangement present in follicular
B cell lymphomas, has been detected in healthy control
persons at, on average, a frequency of 1 in 106 blood lymphocytes, corresponding to a total of >104 B lymphocytes
carrying the t(14;18).13 In the cited paper calling for
targeted therapy during an early stage of malignancy, this
particular Bcl-2 translocation was put forward as a prime
target.1 However, it seems unlikely that the presence of
t(14;18) reflects early malignancy and indication for
therapy; if so, we would all be patients.

Quantity of Tumor Resistance
A later step on the path to cancer disease is the DNA
damage response, regarded as a major tumor resistance
factor. The heavy load of DNA damage is drastically
reduced by the concerted action of >100 DNA repair
441

genes. Furthermore, a substantial fraction of all kinases (a
total of >1000 proteins, encoded by >500 human kinase
genes, have been identified) are thought to participate in
complex signaling pathways during the cellular response
to DNA damage—for example, acting to balance p53
activation and degradation.8
DNA damage can also be eliminated by sacrificing
heavily damaged cells. Apoptosis of nonselfish cell types
is common; for example, granulocytes become selfwounded by their potent reactive oxygen species weaponry, causing 1011 cells of this type to be replaced (instead
of cured) every day by new volunteers raised in the bone
marrow.14
Still further down the path, after a cancer cell has
been formed, host resistance mechanisms, thought to
drastically limit cancer disease frequency by ‘‘nipping
cancer in its bud,’’ come into action.6,8,15,16 A neoplastic
phenotype can become neutralized upon contact of the
cancer cell with normal epithelial cells.6,16 This contact
can occur through homotypic interaction; ie, between
similar protein domains on both cell partners, as exemplified by E-cadherin.17,18 Immune surveillance has been
shown to correlate strongly with prognosis. For example,
the tissue section density of T cells in areas near colon
cancer tumors is a better prognostic indicator, even as
compared with conventional TNM staging derived from
the cancer’s size and spreading. At an early clinical stage,
5-year survival was seen in 73% of patients presenting
with an abundance of CD8þ CD45R0þ T cells, in
contrast to 33% in those with less of this cell type.19 The
quantitative outcome of these host resistance mechanisms
is often influenced by interacting host and cancer cell
characteristics. For instance, inhibition of cancer cell
survival and growth by adherence junction proteins such
as E-cadherin and catenins on normal epithelium may be
circumvented by Wnt pathway mutations in the cancer.16

Does a Robust Regulatory Network
Control the Low and Narrow
Cancer Incidence?
A contrast emerges from the long list of tumor-influencing quantities. This is between huge amounts of both
DNA lesions (>1020) and tumor resistance mechanisms
(involving >103 proteins) in an unfathomable number of
cells (>1013), and, conversely, the relatively low and very
narrow incidence (10-1-100) of overt cancer disease. The
big gap between tumor-influencing events and incidence
has been addressed by the mutation-centered multi-hit

442

model. This model postulates that highly efficient DNA
replication and DNA repair, only rarely making an error,
will set the mutation rate in human cells at a crucial level,
producing a low-probability combination of cancer-causing mutations (a set of 5-10 is usually invoked) in the
single cell developing into a cancer. Since cancer incidence
is much the same in mammal species with different body
size and total cell number, one must then assume that a
whale with >106 times as many cells as a mouse is
endowed with a much superior capacity to keep its
genome intact. However, there is evidence that argues
against a model built upon such precise and species-specific rates of production of cancer-prediposing mutations.
Numerous studies on DNA repair allele polymorphisms
have failed to provide any solid evidence of association
with cancer risk.20 In this context, an important quantitative observation is that cancer incidence is fixed at a
narrow window (10-1-100 per individual) (Fig. 1). If
cancer incidence were a single tenfold lower, a fair guess is
that virtually all of us would die from some cause other
than cancer; conversely, a tenfold or a hundred-fold
increase would give every man and woman 3 or 30 malignant tumors.
Therefore, for a multi-hit model to be compatible
with the narrow cancer incidence window, the DNA-conserving mechanism needs to be highly accurate in eliminating damage, but must not be more accurate than what
is required to reduce incidence down to 10-1-100. Thus, if
the human cell were as efficient in DNA conservation as a
whale cell, human cancer incidence would be <10-1.
In biology the whole is said not to be equal to the
sum of its parts. Proponents of systems biology take host
resistance as supporting a ‘‘larger picture that tumors are a
consequence of a disrupted regulation of normal cell and
tissue development, rather than a reductionist view of
mutated signaling pathways that act as proximate cause in
tumorigenesis’’21. Other complex diseases occurring at
similar frequencies, such as cardiovascular and neurologic
disorders, may be seen as a manifestation of robustness,
denoting the property of biological systems to maintain
stability in the face of environmental changes or
‘‘noise.’’22
Infections can illustrate this principle. A heterogeneous collection of microbes form the direct cause of
approximately 10% of all deaths worldwide. How is this
‘‘acceptable’’ and narrow incidence achieved in the human
species living in an ocean of invaders (a total of >1014
potentially pathogenic bacterial cells reside on our skin
and mucous membranes)? This comparison also holds

true for epidemic microbes; for example, you will contract
influenza only when exposed to a high number of virus
particles, and most probably not until some of them overcome barriers and reach deep into the airways. Most certainly, we are constantly nipping potential infections in
the bud by the action of lymphoid tissues strategically
located throughout the body. A single microorganism
that succeeds in becoming the proximate cause of a
lifethreatening infection is, as a rule, genetically identical
with a myriad of its relatives being halted by host
resistance and causing no disease.
In analogy, is the principal cause of cancer not the
presence of transformed cells, but instead the rare failures
of a polygenic and systemic regulatory resistance mechanism, functioning like a brain to handle huge numbers of
tumor-influencing events? The existence of a network regulatory mechanism directing a ‘‘just-right-for-the-species’’
number of cells to form a malignant disease would explain
the Peto’s paradox of similar cancer frequency in animals
with vastly different total cell numbers.23 In light of evolution, it makes sense for a species not only to counteract
cancer, but also to accept and seek a narrow incidence
window. A higher incidence would confer a selective
disadvantage by taking a significant toll on individuals of
reproductive and child-rearing age. And a lower incidence
would bring no major selective advantage (at the present
incidence level, cancer strikes only rarely at a young age),
but probably a disadvantage by demanding investment in
enhanced tumor defence.
There is some experimental data to support the existence of a regulatory network. Results from high-throughput analysis of mRNA and protein profiles have been
taken as evidence of disease-perturbed networks in prostate cancer.24 Nature’s own experiments on extreme deviation of a tumor-influencing factor suggest that a shift
in one component, even if highly efficient, cannot be
expected to significantly affect incidence of the common
cancer forms. One example is excessive exposure to a
cancer-causing agent, such as radium paint applied to
clocks, asbestos, or ionizing radiation from atomic bombs.
Although an increase in cancer incidence follows such
exposure, it does not involve every exposed individual;
therefore, incidence does not fall outside the narrow
window, and does not include the common cancer forms.
The same argument may apply to a deficiency in a resistance factor, exemplified by a relatively modest increase of
a limited set of cancer forms in patients with a heritable
MSH or BRCA DNA repair defect, and in patients on
long-term post-transplantation immunosuppression. Is

there a robust regulatory mechanism to keep the severe
noise made by these deficiencies from significantly interfering with cancer incidence?
A recent epidemiological study also suggests a putative regulatory mechanism.25 Analysis of age-adjusted
incidence of breast cancer and what is called microbial
cancer (cervical/human papilloma virus, gastric/helicobacter pylori, and liver/hepatitis B virus) in women from
74 geographical regions revealed a striking, hyperbolic
inverse relationship. This means that the product of the
rates of these two cancer forms is constant across the
global female population. For example, if the relative risk
of breast cancer in Sweden is X times higher as compared
with the Chennai district of India, it follows that the
Indian women’s relative risk of microbial cancer is X times
higher than in Sweden. To those sceptical of the mutational multi-step paradigm, it is tempting to take this
study as evidence of a robust regulatory mechanism guiding cancer incidence to fall within the just-right narrow
window.

Can We Reduce Cancer Incidence by
Manipulating a Regulatory Network?
Can we understand the mechanism behind a regulatory
network and let it guide us to potent therapeutic tools? Or
should research focus on inhibitors of cancer gene products? First, what are the prospects for targeted therapy to
provide substantial help? Second, is any means available
to interfere with a robust regulatory network?
Targeted drugs in general provide a limited benefit
to patients, and even imatinib (Gleevec), the exception to
this rule, is associated with relapses. The limitations can
be illustrated by the trastuzumab monoclonal antibody
(Herceptin) in early breast cancer (20% of all breast
cancers are HER2þ, and thus eligible for this targeted
drug). Addition of the antibody to a standard chemotherapy regimen increased 3-year disease-free survival from
74.3% to 80.6%, with statistical significance at P < .001
(the HERA study).26 Another targeted drug widely in
clinical use is sorafenib, increasing progression-free survival in renal cell carcinoma patients from 2.8 to 5.5
months, but as yet with no significant impact on overall
survival.27,28 Treatment may be enhanced by designing
cocktails of multiple and personalized molecular inhibitors, in an attempt to keep ahead of emerging drug-resistant cancer cells. However, results on the full DNA
sequence of single cancer cells are now emerging, revealing
>104 mutations and larger rearrangements not found in
443

Commentary

corresponding normal cells.29,30 These data indicate it
will not be a simple and straightforward task to identify
optimal targets for therapy. Targeted drugs may not attain
magic bullet status, urging us to look for new therapeutic
principles.
First-degree relatives of patients with a major cancer
type run a 2-fold risk of contracting the same tumor type,
and genome-wide association studies have revealed that,
typically, 10 common single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) are associated with a slight increase in risk for each
of the major cancer forms. For example, the 14% of UK
women who are homozygotic for the rs2981582 allele of
the FGFR2 gene have a 1.38 relative risk to develop breast
cancer, compared with the average risk in the population.
Those 38% lacking this allele have a low risk (0.83),
which may indicate gene products conferring resistance
rather than risk.31 Even if these variant alleles don’t
usually provide any clues as to the cause of the tumor,32
an impact through the joint action of many genes
should not be ruled out. In the future it may also be
worthwhile to study associations between cancer and sets
of variants in spheres not strictly limited to genetics, such
as the ‘‘epigenome’’, ‘‘proteome’’, ‘‘transcriptome’’, or
microRNAs.33
A truly systemic approach would consider whether
intervention with food supplements, hormones, or
inflammatory modulators can inhibit tumors at an early
stage. The anti-cancer effect of severe caloric restriction is
well established, and was documented many years ago.34
It has been estimated that deficient intake of 40 micronutrients, such as folic acid, B6, B12, niacin, iron, zinc, and
vitamins C and E could explain why the quarter of the US
population that eats the least fruit and vegetables has double the cancer rate, compared with the upper quarter.35
The sudden reduction in postmenopausal hormone
therapy in 2002, in the wake of reports of elevated breast
cancer risk, has been causally linked to the recorded
decrease in invasive breast cancer between 2001 and
2003.36 This rapid effect on cancer incidence is difficult
to reconcile with carcinogenic mutations playing a major
role in the development of overt cancer. The drastic
changes in cancer type patterns seen in many migrating
populations do not become fully manifest until after a
couple of generations have been raised in the new environment. However, immigrants are slow to adopt new dietary
patterns, which leads to the assumption that a prompt
change in diet may reduce colorectal carcinoma in less
than the time required for an early adenoma to develop
into full malignancy. Thus, a quick reduction in cancer

444

incidence has been linked to environmental factors,
providing circumstantial evidence that clinical cancer
disease can be influenced by manipulation via a systemic
regulatory mechanism.
Intensive chemotherapy is sometimes curative, as
illustrated by childhood leukemia and testicular cancer.
Among the more frequent cancer forms all kinds of
responses occur, including therapy-resistant relapses and a
complete lack of anti-tumor effect. To complicate
matters, it has been documented that a case with no
response to the most aggressive drug combinations can
reach partial and lasting remission while undergoing
weekly cytotoxic therapy.37 Furthermore, mathematical
modeling has predicted that low-dose treatment will provide longer survival than intensive regimens by keeping a
cancer stable until the patient dies from some other
cause.38 Taken together, these observations indicate that
treatment outcome is decided by a dual impact of drug
cytotoxicity; on both the cancer cells and on host resistance cells. As an example, a child’s acute leukemia cells are
killed by the drugs, and any impact on a host regulatory
web mechanism is of no relevance. As another example, in
a slowly growing cancer a mild therapy may have no direct
effect on the tumor cells, but instead strengthens a regulatory network, perhaps by signaling danger to potentiate
host resistance. For successful cancer treatment we may
need to both hit the cancer cell itself and bolster systemic
resistance. An example of such a combined approach is tumor vaccination for patients with minimal residual disease
after chemotherapy.39 In the future we may succeed in
manipulating a regulatory network enough for it to
become curative—ideally with no need for assistance
from cytotoxic chemotherapy.
