Abstract
Silybin, a main component of the milk thistle of Silybum
marianum, has been reported to possess anticancer activity.
We investigated the effects of IdB 1016, a complex of silybin
with phosphatidylcholine, on the development of mammary
tumors appearing spontaneously in HER-2/neu transgenic
mice. The mechanisms involved in the antitumor effect of
IdB 1016 were evaluated by studying the apoptosis, senescentlike growth arrest, intratumoral leukocyte infiltrate, and the
expression of HER-2/neu and p53 in tumoral mammary glands
from transgenic mice and in human breast SKBR3 tumor cells.
The administration of IdB 1016 delayed the development of
spontaneous mammary tumors, reduced the number and size
of mammary tumor masses, and diminished lung metastasization in HER-2/neu transgenic mice. In tumoral mammary
glands from IdB 1016–treated mice, a down-regulation of
HER-2/neu gene expression was associated with an increased
senescent-like growth arrest of tumor cells, and an increased
infiltrate of neutrophils, CD4, and CD8 T cells. Both senescentlike growth arrest and apoptosis were significantly increased
and were associated with a reduced p185HER-2/neu protein and
an increased p53 mRNA in SKBR3 in vitro treated with IdB
1016 in comparison with control cells. The results show the
antitumor effect of IdB 1016 in the development of spontaneous mammary tumors in HER-2/neu transgenic mice. The
effect of IdB 1016 might be related to the down-regulation of
HER-2/neu expression and the induction of senescent-like
growth arrest and apoptosis through a p53-mediated pathway
in tumor cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2022–9]

Introduction
There is an increasing interest in identifying potent preventive
and therapeutic agents against breast cancer. Among the naturally
occurring flavonoids, silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk
thistle of Silybum marianum, has been found to exert high
antitumor-promoting activity (1). Silybin, the main component of
the silymarin complex, has been shown to have comparable
antitumor effects and is as strong an antioxidant as silymarin (1).
Most of the antitumor activity of silybin has been discovered
through in vitro studies in tumor cell lines (2–5). In these studies,
silybin was generally found to induce growth inhibition and

apoptosis of a panel of human and murine tumor cell lines, and to
potentiate the therapeutic potential of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and
carboplatin. Fewer studies have been conducted on the antitumor
effect exerted by in vivo supplementation with silybin or silymarin.
Most data on the in vivo effects of these compounds have been
drawn from studies done in mice treated with carcinogens or in
nude mice bearing human xenografts (6–10); although informative,
these data may not be entirely relevant to the development of most
cancers in humans, in which the tumor is spontaneous and is
initiated by the clonal expansion from a single cell in vivo.
The possible therapeutic application of silybin is hampered by its
poor enteral absorption, which accounts for its very low
bioavailability. IdB 1016 (silipide) is a complex of silybin with
phosphatidylcholine. After oral administration, IdB 1016 gives
plasma levels significantly higher than those found after the
administration of silybin to rats (11, 12) or to humans (13). When
tested in animal models, IdB 1016 was found to be very active in
inhibiting the growth of human ovarian cancer xenografted into
athymic mice and in potentiating the activity of suboptimal doses
of cisplatin (14, 15). IdB 1016 has been shown to be very well
tolerated and largely free of any adverse effects both in preclinical
and in clinical studies.
The HER-2/neu proto-oncogene encodes a receptor-like transmembrane protein with a relative molecular mass of 185 kDa
(p185) and homology to epidermal growth factor receptor (16).
Overexpression of HER-2/neu is present in 15% to 40% of all human
breast cancers and is associated with a poorer rate of survival and a
higher risk for recurrent disease after primary therapy (17, 18). The
causal relationship of this association is indicated by the evidence
that transgenic mice that express activated neu develop multiple
mammary tumors at an early age (19). Overexpression of HER-2/
neu can lead to neoplastic transformation, as shown in transgenic
mice, in which the activated neu transgene expression results in
rapid conversion of the normal mammary epithelium to the
malignant phenotype (20). Furthermore, overexpression rather
than mutation of neu may be the primary mechanism contributing
to breast cancer because examination of primary breast cancer
biopsies has yet to reveal comparable activating mutations (21, 22).
For many years, the anticancer effect exerted by chemotherapeutic drugs has been related to the induction of apoptosis; more
recently, it has been shown that an alternative pathway to cell
death leading to permanent growth arrest in cancer cells may
occur and may be involved in the anticancer effect of many
substances. This phenomenon, called senescent-like growth arrest,
is a cellular response that resembles replicative senescence
occurring in normal cells and that may be crucial for protection
against cancer development (23–25). A commonly used surrogate
marker of senescence is the senescence-associated h-galactosidase

IdB 1016 in HER-2/neu Transgenic Mice

Figure 1. Effect of IdB 1016 administration on tumor incidence, HER-2/neu mRNA expression, and senescent-like growth arrest in tumoral mammary glands.
A, HER-2/neu transgenic mice were supplemented daily or twice a week with IdB 1016 (450 mg/kg/d, equivalent to 414 Amol/L/kg of silybin) and analyzed for the
kinetics of tumor incidence (percentage of tumor-free mice) and the tumor multiplicity (mean number of palpable mammary carcinomas per mouse). Difference in tumor
incidence was significant between IdB 1016 (daily) versus control (P < 0.05) and IdB 1016 (twice a week) versus control (P < 0.02). Differences in tumor multiplicity
were significant between IdB 1016 (daily) versus control from week 33 (P < 0.05), and IdB 1016 (twice a week) versus control from week 31 (P < 0.02). Data are
from one of two experiments each done with 10 animals per group. B, mammary tumors from daily (Tc) or twice a week (Ti ) IdB 1016–treated and control HER-2/neu
transgenic mice were analyzed for HER-2/neu mRNA expression by reverse transcription-PCR. The RNA reverse-transcribed and amplified was normalized for
h-actin expression in individual samples; columns, mean; bars, SD. Data are representative of one of three independent experiments involving three mice for each
group. C, cryostat sections of tumoral mammary glands from control or IdB 1016 (twice a week)–treated mice were examined for the presence of senescent cells
by SA-h-gal assay. A total of three tumors for each mice group were examined. For each tumor, two sections were analyzed. The evaluation of senescent cells relative
to five fields at the microscope was quantified through image analysis; columns, mean percentage area of positive cells; bars, SD. Data are representative of one
of two independent experiments.

(SA-h-gal). The SA-h-gal is a reagent required for identifying
senescent cells using a staining procedure. The assay is based on a
histochemical stain for h-gal activity at pH 6. Under these
conditions, h-gal activity is easily detectable in senescent cells,

but is undetectable in presenescent cells (26). Like other damage
responses of normal cells, such as quiescence and apoptosis,
senescent-like terminal proliferation arrest involves the function of
wild-type p53 (27, 28).

Cancer Research

The aim of the present article is to investigate the effect of IdB
1016 on the development of mammary tumors appearing
spontaneously in HER-2/neu transgenic mice at an early age. The
mechanisms involved in the antitumoral action were analyzed
studying the effects determined by IdB 1016 on the expression
of mRNA for HER-2/neu and p53, on the levels of p185HER-2/neu
protein, on the induction of senescent-like growth arrest or
apoptosis in tumor cells, and on the intratumoral leukocyte
infiltrate.

Materials and Methods
Animals. FVB/N transgenic female mice for the activated rat neu
oncogene were obtained from Charles River (Hollister, CA) and were
maintained under specific pathogen–free conditions under a standard
light/dark regimen (12 h light/12 h darkness) in our animal facilities. Mice
were housed in plastic non–galvanized cages and fed with standard pellet
food (Nossan, Italy) and tap water ad libitum. Procedures and facilities
followed the requirements of Commission Directive 86/609/EEC concerning
the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific
purposes. Italian legislation is defined in D.L. no. 116 of January 27, 1992.
Tumor cell lines. SKBR3 is a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line
overexpressing human HER-2/neu. Confluent monolayers (5  105 cells/
cm2) of the tumor cell lines growing in their complete medium [DMEM
plus 10% fetal bovine serum; all from Invitrogen S.R.L., san Giuliano
Milanese (MI), Italy] were treated with a 0.25% solution of trypsin in PBS
and used for in vitro experiments.
Experimental design. Female FVB/N HER-2/neu mice were analyzed in
two different experiments. IdB 1016 (silipide) is a complex of silybin (2-[2,3dihydro-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl]-2,3-dihyidro3,5,7-tri-hydroxy-4h-1-benzopyran-4-one) with phosphatidylcholine
obtained by precipitation with n-hexane of an acetonic solution of silybin
and phosphatidylcholine in a 1:1 molar ratio. In contrast to silybin, this
complex is a light yellow powder freely soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons,
ethers, and chlorinated solvents. IdB 1016 (supplied by INDENA, Milan,
Italy) was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose in sterile water at a
concentration of 45 mg/mL, and was administered at a dose of 450 mg/kg,
equivalent to 414 Amol/L/kg silybin, through oral gavage. Mice, at the age of
24 weeks, were randomly divided into three groups which received (a) IdB
1016 daily for 1 month, (b) IdB 1016 twice a week for 1 month for a total of
eight administrations, and (c) carboxymethylcellulose (0.5%) in sterile water
(control group). Twice a week, all mice were palpated for the detection of
mammary tumors. The neoplastic masses were measured with calipers in

the two perpendicular diameters. Progressively growing masses of >3 mm
in mean diameter were regarded as tumors. In each group of mice, the
number of lung metastases present at the end of the treatment was
evaluated using China ink. HER-2/neu expression was evaluated in tumor
masses of 4 to 5 mm of diameter. In in vitro experiments, SKBR3 cells, after
overnight serum deprivation, were treated with IdB 1016 at doses ranging
from 7.9 to 126.5 Ag/mL (corresponding to 2.25-44 Amol/L silybin) for
the times indicated. In selected experiments, SKBR3 tumor cells were
treated with silybin (supplied by INDENA) at the concentrations of 25, 50,
or 100 Amol/L.
Quantification of apoptosis by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was
measured through (a) detection of mitochondrial permeability transition
event (early apoptosis), and (b) subdiploid DNA peak analysis after staining
with propidium iodide (late apoptosis). For evaluation of the change in the
mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were stained with JC-1 according
to the protocol provided in the MitoPT Kit (Alexis Italia, Vinci-Biochem, Fi,
Italy). For subdiploid DNA evaluation, cells were washed twice in PBS after
incubation and resuspended in 0.75 mL of hypotonic fluorochrome
solution containing 50 Ag/mL of propidium iodide (Calbiochem, La Jolla,
CA) in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich S.R.L.,
Milano, Italy) in polypropylene tubes (Nunc, VWR International S.R.L.,
Milano, Italy). The tubes were placed at 4jC in the dark overnight before
the flow-cytometric analysis (29). The propidium iodide fluorescence of
individual nuclei was determined using a XL flow cytometer (Coulter,
Hialeah, FL) and the percentage of apoptotic nuclei was determined on the
basis of the number of subdiploid DNA peak in the DNA fluorescence
histogram.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of
mRNA for HER-2/neu was evaluated in mammary tumor masses from IdB
1016–treated or untreated mice by reverse transcription-PCR. After
homogenization of tissue samples, RNA was extracted using TRI-REAGENT
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich). After
treatment with DNase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), RNA concentrations
were determined by spectrophotometer (Scientific Instruments UV1601
Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). cDNA was synthesized from 0.1 Ag of RNA
incubating RNA with deoxynucleotide triphosphate (0.5 mmol/L), Oligo dT
(12.5 ng/AL), First Strand buffer (1), Moloney murine leukemia virus
reverse transcriptase (10 units/AL), RNase inhibitor (1units/AL), and DTT
(0.01 mmol/L) all from Invitrogen S.R.L., in a final volume of 20 AL.
The samples were incubated at 37jC for 1 h and 95jC for 10 min;
subsequently, cDNA was frozen at 20jC until use. PCR was done
incubating 5 AL of cDNA with a reaction mixture containing: PCR buffer
(1), MgCl2 (1.5 mmol/L), deoxynucleotide triphosphate (200 Amol/L),
specific forward and reverse primers (0.8 Amol/L of each), Taq DNA

polymerase (1 unit/AL) in a total volume of 50 AL (Promega Italia, Milano,
Italy). The samples were incubated in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700
(Perkin-Elmer S.p.A., Monza (MI), Italy) for a total of 35 cycles for HER-2/
neu, and 30 cycles for h-actin. Each cycle consisted of 1 min at 94jC,
1 min at 65jC, and 1 min at 72jC for HER-2/neu; 1 min at 94jC, 2 min at
63jC, and 1 min at 72jC for h-actin.
The primers for rat HER-2/neu, human p53, and human or mouse
h-actin were purchased from Invitrogen S.R.L. using DNA published cDNA
sequences. The rat HER-2/neu fragment of 220 bp was defined by the
forward primer, 5¶-CTGGAGGACGTGCCGCTTGTA; and the reverse primer,
5¶-ATAGCTCCACACATCACTCTG. The human p53 fragment of 214 bp was
defined by the forward primer, 5¶-GGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTAT; and the
reverse primer, 5¶-GTCTTCCAGTGTGATGATGGTG. Mouse h-actin fragment of 265 bp by the forward primer, 5¶-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC; and the reverse primer, 5¶-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG;
human h-actin fragment of 77 bp by the forward primer, 5¶-GCGAGAAGATGACCCAGATC; and the reverse primer, 5¶-GGATAGCACAGCCTGGATAG. The PCR products and a molecular weight standard [DNA molecular
weight marker VIII, Roche S.p.A., Monza (MI), Italy] were visualized after
electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel containing 1 Ag/AL ethidium bromide.
Densitometric analysis was done using the GelDoc 2000 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Italy).
Flow cytometric measurement of p185HER-2/neu. Subconfluent cultures
of SKBR3 tumor cells were starved overnight removing serum and were
treated with 31.6, 63.2, or 126.5 Ag/mL of IdB 1016 for 24 h. To evaluate
p185HER-2/neu protein through flow cytometry, tumor cells were washed with
a solution of PBS, 5% FCS, and 0.04% NaN3. SKBR3 tumor cells were
incubated with a FITC-labeled anti-p185HER-2/neu monoclonal antibody
(Ab-3; Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) for 30 min at 4jC. The cell pellet
was washed with PBS with 0.1% NaN3 and resuspended in Isoton II
(Coulter). FITC-labeled mouse IgG (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was used
as isotype control. Cell fluorescence was analyzed through a XL flow
cytometer (Coulter).
SA-B-gal staining and image analysis. Visualization of SA-h-gal for the
detection of senescent cells was done using the Senescent Cells staining kit
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative
numbers of stained cells were determined in independent countings and
analyzed statistically. The digital images of in vivo and in vitro samples
obtained from Leica Imaging Systems Ltd. (Cambridge, United Kingdom)
were imported to Image J program (version 1.24o, NIH) and converted to
8-bit grayscale images. Image analysis was then used to determine the
percentage area of h-gal staining. Quantitative studies of h-gal–positive
cells were done by evaluating four randomly chosen fields in each sample.
The area of h-gal–positive cells was measured after thresholding to determine the absorbance that corresponded to specific staining of positive
cells. Subsequently, the percentage area of h-gal–positive cells was
calculated by dividing the area of the reaction product by the total area of
the measured field.
Morphologic analysis. Groups of three mice bearing a 3  3 mm
mammary tumor were killed for each group. Tumor tissues were
embedded in Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature compound (Miles,
Inc., Elkhart, IN) frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at 80jC until
sectioning. For immunohistochemistry, 4-Am cryostat sections were fixed
in acetone (at 20jC) for 5 to 10 min and washed twice with PBS.
Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 0.1% hydrogen peroxide in
methanol for 5 min. The slides were washed in PBS and incubated in
normal blocking serum for 20 min to prevent nonspecific binding; they
were washed again and immunostained with purified rat anti-mouse
monoclonal antibody to CD8a (Ly-2), CD4 (L3T4), MAC-3, and Ly-6G
(Gr-1; PharMingen) for 30 min at room temperature. Antibody binding
was localized using an anti-rat biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), StreptABComplex conjugated with alkaline
phosphatase (Dako Italia, Milan, Italy), and Fuchsin Substrate-Chromogen
System (Dako). Staining with isotype-matched rat IgG was done as a
negative control. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Quantitative studies of the immunohistochemically stained reactions were done by
evaluating five randomly chosen fields in each sample. Individual cells

without serum to synchronize their cell cycle, cells were treated without or with
the indicated amounts of IdB 1016 in complete medium. Differences between

were counted under a 400 microscopic field (40 objective and 10
ocular lens: 0.180 mm2/field).
Statistical analysis. Differences in tumor incidence were evaluated by
the Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test; differences in tumor multiplicity were
evaluated by Student’s t test; differences in lung metastasization were
evaluated by Fisher exact test, and differences in mRNA expression and in
immune variables were evaluated by Student’s t test.

Results
Effect of IdB 1016 administration on the kinetics of tumor
growth and on lung metastasization. As shown in Fig. 1A (top),
the first mammary tumor appeared in untreated mice at 27.5 weeks
of age. The tumor incidence increased progressively with
increasing age of mice, affecting 50% or 100% of tumor-bearing
mice at 28.5 or 29.5 weeks of age, respectively. In HER-2/neu mice
treated with both continuous or intermittent IdB 1016, the
appearance of the first mammary tumor was not significantly
delayed. However, a slower kinetic of tumor incidence was found in
treated mice compared with control mice. At week 29.5, when 100%
of control mice were bearing one or more tumor masses, 80% or

50% of IdB 1016–supplemented mice through intermittent or
continuous administration, respectively, were still tumor-free. Fifty
percent of the mice bore tumors at 29.5 or 32.5 weeks of age in
following continuous (P < 0.05 versus control) or intermittent
(P < 0.02 versus control) IdB 1016, respectively. All mice bore
tumors at week 33. The kinetics of tumor development were similar
in the two experiments done.
As shown in Fig. 1A (bottom), the mean number of mammary
tumors progressively increased in control mice. A significant
reduction of the mean tumor number was observed in IdB 1016–
treated mice either through continuous or intermittent administration. Differences in tumor multiplicity were significant between
IdB 1016 (daily) versus control from week 33 (P < 0.05) and IdB
1016 (twice a week) versus controls from week 31 (P < 0.02).
As shown in Table 1, IdB 1016 reduced the percentage of mice
with metastasis and the mean size of lung metastasis in
comparison with control mice. The difference was statistically
significant only for intermittent IdB 1016 administration (P < 0.01).
Effect of in vivo IdB 1016 administration on leukocyte
tumor infiltrate. We analyzed leukocyte infiltrate in the mammary
tumor samples from control and IdB 1016–treated mice. As shown
in Table 1, IdB 1016 administration was associated with an
increased number of neutrophils (P < 0.008), CD4 (P < 0.0008), and
CD8 (P < 0.0001) lymphocytes, in comparison with control mice.
Effect of in vivo IdB 1016 administration on HER-2/neu
expression. To evaluate the effect of IdB 1016 on tumor cells, we
studied mRNA expression for HER-2/neu on tumor cells following
reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA extracted from mammary
tumors of IdB 1016–treated and control mice. As shown in Fig. 1B,
the expression of mRNA for HER-2/neu was reduced in mammary
tumors from IdB 1016–treated mice compared with control mice
[mean relative expressions versus h-actin were 0.76 F 0.12, 0.59 F
0.06, and 0.33 F 0.14; mean F SD, for samples from controls, IdB
1016-intermittently treated (Ti) and IdB 1016-continuously treated
(Tc) mice; P < 0.01 versus controls].

Induction of a senescence-like phenotype by in vivo
administration of IdB 1016. As shown in Fig. 1C (left), IdB
1016 treatment increased the number of cells with a senescencelike phenotype in mammary tumor samples, as evidenced by the
augmented number of cells with enlarged and flattened morphology and with increased SA-h-gal staining. Image analysis processing showed a significantly increased percentage area of SA-h-gal
staining in tumor masses from IdB 1016–treated in comparison
with control mice (0.136 F 0.09 versus 0.002 F 0.003; P < 0.0001;
Fig. 1C, right).
Effect of in vitro IdB 1016 treatment on p185HER-2/neu
protein. We then analyzed the p185 protein on SKBR3 tumor cells
after 24 h of incubation with IdB 1016. As shown in Fig. 2A, the
expression of p185HER-2/neu was reduced on SKBR3 cells after
treatment with 126.5 Ag/mL of IdB 1016 (equivalent to 44 Amol/L of
silybin, mean fluorescence values: 35.7 and 23.0 for control and IdB
1016–treated tumor cells, respectively). A similar reduction of
p185HER-2/neu protein on tumor cells was observed using 31.6 or
63.2 Ag/mL of IdB 1016 (equivalent to 11 or 22 Amol/L of silybin;
data not shown). The 24-h incubation of SKBR3 with silybin
reduced the p185HER-2/neu protein to a concentration of only
100 Amol/L (data not shown).
Induction of a senescence-like phenotype by in vitro
treatment with IdB 1016. To evaluate the effect of IdB 1016 on
tumor cell growth, 2  106 SKBR3 cells were seeded in culture
flasks and cultured for 2 days, they were then starved overnight
removing serum and, on day 3, IdB 1016 was added. As shown in
Fig. 2B, untreated SKBR3 cells continued their progressive growth
on days 4 and 5 of culture; in the presence of 31.6 Ag/mL of IdB
1016 (equivalent to 11 Amol/L of silybin), SKBR3 tumor cells
showed a slower kinetics of growth in comparison with control
cultures; 63.2 and 126.5 Ag/mL of IdB 1016 (equivalent to 22 and
44 Amol/L of silybin) induced a growth arrest in SKBR3 tumor
cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, IdB 1016–treated SKBR3 tumor cells

Effect of in vitro IdB 1016 treatment on apoptosis of SKBR3
tumor cell line. To gain insight into the mechanism of action of
IdB 1016, we assessed SKBR3 tumor cells cultured in the presence
or absence of IdB 1016 for features of apoptotic cells. As shown in
Fig. 4A, 24-h IdB 1016 treatment increased the percentage of early
apoptosis in SKBR3 tumor cells, as evidenced by the higher number
of cells with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (DC). The
staining with propidium iodide evidenced an increased number
of subdiploid DNA peaks in 48-h IdB 1016–treated SKBR3 cells
(Fig. 4B and C). No increase of apoptosis was observed in 24-h IdB
1016–treated cells by propidium iodide staining (data not shown).

the effect of IdB 1016 on senescent-like growth arrest and on
apoptosis was related to a modulation of p53 expression, we
analyzed p53 mRNA expression in SKBR3 tumor cells after in vitro
IdB 1016 treatment. As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression of
p53 mRNA was increased in SKBR3 cells treated for 5 h with 126.5
Ag/mL of IdB 1016 (equivalent to 44 Amol/L of silybin; relative
expression of p53 versus h-actin was 0.20 F 0.03, 0.55 F 0.41,

Discussion
The results reported in this article show for the first time the
antitumor activity of IdB 1016, a complex of silybin and
phosphatidylcholine, in a spontaneous breast cancer tumor model.
The data shows that (a) IdB 1016 administration delays the
development of spontaneous mammary tumors and reduces the
number of mammary tumor masses and the number of lung
metastases in HER-2/neu transgenic mice; (b) that IdB 1016 downregulates HER-2/neu gene expression, induces p53 expression, and
increases senescent-like growth arrest and apoptosis
in tumoral mammary glands and in human breast SKBR3 tumor
cell line.
HER-2/neu transgenic mice spontaneously develop tumors in
their mammary glands at an early age (19, 30). We show that the
administration of IdB 1016 before the appearance of palpable
mammary tumors determines a significant slowing down of the
kinetic of tumor development, a lower number of tumor masses,
and a lower frequency and size of lung metastasis. Because in
FVB/N transgenic mice, mammary tumors are histologically
evident at 12 weeks of age (data not shown), and the IdB 1016
treatment was started in 24-week-old mice, our data suggests that
the antitumoral effect of IdB 1016 in our experimental model may

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

be considered therapeutic rather that chemopreventive. IdB 1016
is a silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex able to increase the
bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency of silybin. After oral
administration, IdB 1016 has been shown to give plasma levels
significantly higher than those found after the administration of
silybin or silymarin to rats (11, 12) or to humans (13). IdB 1016 has
been shown to be very well tolerated and largely free of any
adverse effect both in preclinical and in clinical studies. Our data
on the antitumoral effect of IdB 1016 in HER-2/neu transgenic
mice confirm and extend previous studies conducted in transplanted mouse models. In these studies, IdB 1016 administration
was found to inhibit the growth of human ovarian cancer
xenografts in nude mice and to potentiate the antitumor activity
of cisplatin (14, 15).
The effectiveness of silybin as an anticancer agent has been
previously reported to be related to its cytoprotective activity,
antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, and to the induction of
tumor cell apoptosis. In this study, we extend the actual knowledge
on the mechanism of action of silybin, providing further potential
mechanisms involved in its anticancer effect. In our experimental
model, IdB 1016 was able to down-regulate HER-2/neu expression
inducing apoptosis and senescent-like terminal proliferation arrest
both in vivo and in vitro. IdB 1016 induced increased levels of
apoptosis in SKBR3 tumor cells. However, levels of cell death were
low and did not completely explain the effect of IdB 1016 on tumor
development; furthermore, a significant increase of apoptosis was
not found after examining mammary tumor masses from IdB
1016–treated versus control mice (data not shown). It has been
suggested that senescent-like growth arrest may be a significant
determinant of tumor response to anticancer agents in conditions
in which the induction of cell death plays a minimal role in their
antiproliferative effect (23, 25). Our data show that IdB 1016
induces senescent-like growth arrest both in vivo and in vitro. In
fact, an increased number of cells positive for SA-h-gal were found
in mammary tumors from IdB 1016–treated mice. Furthermore,
in vitro IdB 1016 was able to slow down the kinetics of growth and
to increase the number of SA-h-gal–positive cells in the SKBR3
tumor cell line. Both apoptosis and senescent-like growth arrest
were associated with a down-regulation of HER-2/neu expression
in IdB 1016–treated mice and in SKBR3 cultures. The relationship
between reduced expression of HER-2/neu oncogene expression
and induction of apoptosis was previously reported by us (30) and
others (31) in other experimental models. To our knowledge, this is
the first study showing a correlation between down-regulation of
the HER-2/neu oncogene and the activation of senescent-like
growth arrest.
Both apoptosis and accelerated senescence are regulated largely
by p53. In cancer cells, although the senescent-like growth arrest
does not seem to be dependent on functional p53, ectopic p53
expression has been shown to promote cellular senescence (32).
Furthermore, introduction of wild-type p53 into a p53 null H299
lung cancer cell line was able to induce senescent-like growth
arrest, with no evidence of apoptosis (33). Our data on the
increased expression of p53 in IdB 1016–treated SKBR3 tumor cells
agrees with the above findings showing the promoting activity of
p53 in inducing senescent-like growth arrest.
In transgenic mice, the overexpression of HER-2/neu is
under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter
(20), which has been found to be hormone-dependent (34).
Because silybin can bind to a purified steroid receptor and because
the estrogenic effects of silymarin have been observed in

ovariectomized rats (35), we did experiments to exclude the
potential effect of IdB 1016 on the promoter of HER-2/neu
transgene. As we have reported in a study on another natural
substance with estrogenic properties (30), the evidence that IdB
1016 in vitro modulates the HER-2/neu expression in SKBR3 tumor
cells, in which HER-2/neu is not under the control of mouse
mammary tumor virus promoter, clearly shows that IdB 1016
directly modulates the expression of HER-2/neu gene. In order to
compare the effect of the phospholipid complex IdB 1016 with
silybin, in selected experiments, we tested the activity of silybin on
p185HER-2/neu protein and apoptosis. The data obtained, showing
the ability of silybin to down-regulate p185HER-2/neu protein and to
induce apoptosis in SKBR3 tumor cells only at the higher silybin
concentration tested (100 Amol/L), confirm the lower bioavailability of silybin in comparison with IdB 1016.
The increased number of neutrophils, CD4, and CD8 lymphocytes found in mammary tumors from IdB 1016–treated in

comparison with control animals suggests a local immune
activation, even if the direct or indirect effect of IdB 1016 on
immune cells remains to be further evaluated.
In conclusion, this study shows that IdB 1016 may exert
important antitumor effects delaying the development and
metastasizing capacity of tumors in mice transgenic for the HER2/neu oncogene. The antitumor effect of IdB 1016 might be related
to the down-regulation of HER-2/neu expression and the induction
of senescent-like growth arrest and apoptosis through a p53mediated pathway in HER-2/neu overexpressing mammary tumors
and in tumor cells.
