Small Molecule Inhibitors Targeting the "Achilles' Heel" of
Androgen Receptor Activity
Marianne D. Sadar

Abstract
Androgen ablation therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, but
unfortunately, it is not curative, and eventually the disease will return as lethal castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). Mounting evidence supports the concept that development of CRPC is causally related to
continued transactivation of androgen receptor (AR). All current therapies that target the AR are dependent on
the presence of its C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). However, it is the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the
AR that is the "Achilles' heel" of AR activity, with AF-1 being essential for AR activity regardless of androgen.
Recent efforts to develop drugs to the AR NTD have yielded EPI-001, a small molecule, sintokamide peptides, and
decoys to the AR NTD with EPI-001, the best characterized and most promising for clinical development based
upon specificity, low toxicity, and cytoreductive antitumor activity. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1208–13. 2011 AACR.

Background
Androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
mediate their biological effects through the androgen receptor
(AR). In adult males, the testes produce the majority of
androgen with some contribution from the adrenal glands.
Androgens play a role in a wide range of developmental and
physiologic responses and are involved in male sexual differentiation, maintenance of spermatogenesis, and male gonadotropin regulation. The growth and survival of the prostate is
dependent on androgen. When androgens increase in males
during puberty, there is an increase in growth of the prostate
gland, and in adult males when androgens are reduced by
castration, there is involution of the prostate and apoptosis of
prostate epithelial cells. Thus, the prostate gland is an androgen-dependent organ in which androgens are the predominant mitogenic stimulus. This dependency of the prostate
epithelium on androgens provides the underlying rationale for
treating advanced prostate cancer with androgen ablation.

Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous tumor in Western men. Primary therapies such as radical
prostatectomy and radiation for localized, low grade tumors
generally result in low mortality rates. Unfortunately, high grade
tumors of Gleason score 7 and above have elevated recurrence

rates, even when it seems that the tumor has been successfully
contained with primary therapy. Approximately 20 to 40% of
prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy will
experience tumor recurrence. Once the tumor has recurred,
usually manifest by an increase in serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA), androgen ablation therapy is provided to most
patients. Androgen ablation therapy is achieved through either
orchiectomy (surgical castration) or application of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (chemical castration), which
both cause a transient reduction in tumor burden concomitant
with a decrease in serum PSA. Unfortunately, the malignancy
will eventually begin to grow again in the absence of testicular
androgens to form castration-resistant disease [castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC)]. CRPC is biochemically characterized before the onset of symptoms by a rising titer of serum
PSA. Most patients succumb to CRPC within 2 to 3 years of
biochemical failure. All current therapies directed at AR target
its C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) and eventually fail.
Treatments not targeting AR [e.g., docetaxel or sipuleucel-T
(Provenge, Dendreon)] result in an increased life expectancy of
2 to 4 months.

Androgen Receptor in Castration-Resistant
Prostate Cancer
Mounting evidence supports the concept that CRPC
remains dependent upon AR signaling. Many of the same
genes that are increased by androgens in androgen-dependent
prostate cancer xenografts become elevated in CRPC, such as
PSA. AR protein translocates from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus when activated by androgen or alternative signaling
pathways (1). Thus, the detection of nuclear localization of AR
in CRPC supports that the AR may continue to be transcriptionally active in the absence of testicular androgens. Additional support for the AR continuing to play a role in CRPC
includes the following: amplification of the AR gene and/or

Inhibitors of the AR NTD

increased expression of AR (2–4); delayed onset of CRPC by
altering the timing and sequence of the use of antiandrogens
and additional responses with CYP17 inhibitors that block the
synthesis of androgen (5, 6); and the fact that AR expression is
essential for proliferation and tumor growth (4, 7). Finally, it is
known that AR can be activated through its N-terminal
domain (NTD) in the absence of androgen by stimulation
of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and by bone-derived factors (1, 8, 9).
Androgen receptor as a therapeutic target
The AR has distinct functional domains that include the Cterminal LBD, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), and an NTD.
The AR DBD has been crystallized, which would allow for
rational drug design, but the high degree of homology of this
domain with other steroid hormone receptors may predict
poor specificity and toxic side effects. The transcriptional
activity of most steroid hormone receptors is predominantly
through the activation function (AF)-2 region in the LBD, the
exception being the AR in which it is the AF-1 region in the
NTD that contributes most of the transcriptional activity (10–
12). AR LBD functions independently of the NTD and can still
bind ligand even if the AF-1 region is deleted or mutated;
however, no transcriptional activity can be achieved without
the AF-1 region in the NTD.
Currently, all conventional therapy has concentrated on
androgen-dependent activation of the AR through its C-terminal LBD. These therapies include reduction of androgen that
binds to the LBD by chemical or surgical castration and
application of antiandrogens (Fig. 1A). Unfortunately, castration does not completely eliminate levels of androgen in
metastatic prostate cancer tissue (13). These residual levels
of androgen have raised interest in the roles of adrenal
androgens, transport of androgens, and/or de novo synthesis
of androgen from cholesterol precursors by prostate cancer
cells. Thus, there is renewed interest in inhibitors of androgen
synthesis. These inhibitors include ketoconazole and,
currently in clinical trials, the 17,20-lyase/CYP17 inhibitor
abiraterone, TOK-001, and TAK-700. In addition to inhibiting
17,20-lyase activity to reduce synthesis of androgen,
ketoconazole and TOK-001 (VN/124–1) also have antiandrogen activity. Antiandrogens competitively bind AR LBD.
Antiandrogens used for the clinical management of prostate
cancer include bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone acetate, and investigational compounds MDV3100 and
ARN-509. Although castration and antiandrogens are effective
initially, it is unclear why these approaches eventually fail.
Suspected mechanisms include amplification or overexpression of AR; gain-of-function mutations allowing AR to be
activated by steroids or antiandrogens, although most of these
mutations are considered rare events; ligand-independent
activation by growth factors, cytokines, or kinases; overexpression of AR coactivators; intracrine signaling by increased
intratumoral androgens; and/or expression of constitutively
active splice variants of AR that lack LBD that may be
expressed solely or in mixed populations with full-length
receptor to form a heterodimer (Fig. 1B). Most studies continue to develop antagonists to AR LBD, and specifically, these

include (a) the allosteric pocket and AF-2 activity (14); (b) in
silico "drug repurposing" procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists (15); and (c) coactivator or corepressor
interactions (16–19).
Androgen receptor N-terminal domain as a target for
drug development
AR NTD contains several repeat regions: polyglutamine
between residues 58 and 89; polyproline between residues
371 and 381; and polyglycine between residues 449 and 472.
The transcriptional activity of the AR in response to ligand
requires the NTD AF-1 (Tau1), which is between residues 101
and 370 with core sequence 178LKDIL182 and does not play a
significant role in ligand-independent activation of the AR (8).
Tau5 is between residues 360 and 485 with core sequence
435
WHTLF439 and is considered to be important for activity in
the absence of androgen (20). The AR NTD is flexible with a
high degree of intrinsic disorder making it impossible to be
used for structure-based drug design. The AR AF-1 region has
characteristics of collapsed disorder, meaning that it is predicted to have some proportion of secondary structure, but not
a stable tertiary structure. Induced folding of the AR NTD is
thought to require interactions with other proteins including
bridging factors and the basal transcriptional machinery to
result in active transcription. A recent development is the
acceptance of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions
as attractive drug targets to prevent protein–protein interactions. An example is the nutlins that target the intrinsically
disordered region of p53. When Mdm2 binds to the intrinsically
disordered region (amino acid residues 13 to 19) of p53, a
helical structure is formed that binds into the deep groove on
the surface of Mdm2. As discussed by Uversky and colleagues,
interaction between Mdm2 and p53 involves a disorder-toorder transition upon binding that would thermodynamically
favor blocking by small molecule competitors (21). Other
examples of therapeutics targeting protein–protein interactions include GX015–070 (Obatoclax, Gemin X), which interacts with the hydrophobic groove of bcl2 proteins to prevent
binding of BH3 peptide domain of proapoptotic BCL2 members; inhibitors to XIAP-Diablo interactions and Grb2 SH2
domains; sulindac to prevent RAS-RAF interactions; and inhibitors of WNT pathway targets frizzled-dishevelled (Fj9 inhibitor) and b-catenin–CREB-binding protein (CBP; ICG-001).
For most of these interactions, crystal structures of at least one
of the proteins have aided in the development of drug leads by
permitting docking and virtual screening. Because AR NTD has
not been crystallized and is intrinsically disordered, drug
development is labor intensive and requires assays that test
each drug empirically. However, despite these difficulties, 3
separate classes of inhibitors of the AR NTD have recently been
described: EPI-001, a small molecule (22); sintokamides, which
are peptides isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea species
(23); and a decoy peptide to the AR NTD (24).
Mechanism of action of small molecule inhibitors of
androgen receptor N-terminal domain
Deletion experiments have shown that the NTD is essential
for transcriptional activity of the AR in response to ligand as

well as in the absence of ligand (10). Thus, the AR NTD is the

AR transcriptional activity and is not dependent on the
presence of the LBD. Consistent with EPI-001 not binding

to the LBD, EPI-001 did not compete with androgen in a
competitive ligand-binding assay (22). EPI-001 does not
reduce levels of AR protein, nor does it prevent nuclear
translocation of the AR in response to androgen (22).
EPI-001 was specific for inhibiting AR and had no effect on
the activities of related human steroid receptors, progesterone
receptor (PR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR; ref. 22).
The LBDs and DBDs of these steroid receptors have considerable homology to AR LBD and DBD, but their NTDs have little
sequence similarity (<15%). Fluorescence emission spectroscopy reveals that EPI-001 alters the folding of AR AF-1 but has
no effect on GR AF-1 (22). In addition, many steroid receptors
interact with the same coactivators and bridging factors that
are required for AR activity. Two examples are SRC1–3 and
CREB-binding protein (CBP), which interact with the AR NTD,
and their levels of expression are increased in CRPC. EPI-001
inhibits interaction between CBP and AR in response to both
androgen and in the absence of androgen, by IL-6 (22). CBP is
essential for transcriptional activity regardless of whether the
AR is activated by androgen or IL-6. The fact that EPI-001 had
no effect on the activities of PR and GR, which also require
CBP for activity, supports that EPI-001 interacts with AR NTD
rather than CBP to block the interaction. In vitro experiments
with recombinant proteins revealed that EPI-001 inhibits CBP
interaction with the AF-1 region of the AR NTD (22). AR
interaction with bridging factors like CBP stabilize AR on
androgen response elements (ARE). Indeed EPI-001 inhibited
androgen-induced expression of PSA and TMPRSS2 androgenresponsive genes with well-characterized AREs by a mechanism that involves reduced AR-ARE interaction (22). EPI-001
also inhibits interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (N/C) (22), which is required for antiparallel
dimer formation and is essential for ligand-dependent activity
of the AR. However, bicalutamide also prevents N/C interaction, yet AR bound to bicalutamide still can bind to AREs.
Currently, it is unclear which protein interactions with the AR
are essential for AR-ARE binding and stabilization. AR interacts with 169 different proteins, thereby complicating the
identification of protein interactions blocked by EPI-001 without application of high-throughput approaches. Whether sintokamides inhibit interactions between the AR and a similar
group of proteins to that of EPI-001 is currently under intense
investigation.
Inhibitors to the androgen receptor N-terminal domain
as a therapy for prostate cancer
The NTD has been shown to be a viable target for in vivo
intervention as first indicated by application of decoy molecules encoding residues 1 to 558 of the AR NTD (AR1–558; ref.
24), and then recently using EPI-001 (22). Decoy AR1–558
inhibits full-length AR and blocks both androgen-dependent
and CRPC tumor growth, most likely by a mechanism of
mopping up essential proteins required for transcriptional
activity (24). Development of shorter decoy peptides (100
amino acids in length) to the AR NTD that retain specificity for
AR and still have antitumor activity has been difficult due to
multiple factors, including peptide lability and the possible
requirement of multiple, nonlinear regions of the AR NTD

www.aacrjournals.org

necessary for protein–protein interactions. Systemic delivery
of AR NTD decoys to target intracellular full-length AR in a
clinical setting also could be a significant challenge. Small
molecule inhibitors such as EPI-001, or potentially sintokamides, seem to overcome many of these hurdles for therapeutic development for AR NTD decoys.
Consistent with inhibiting AR activity, EPI-001 blocks ARdependent proliferation in human prostate cancer cells that
express AR and has no effect on the proliferation of cells that
do not express functional AR or do not rely on the AR for
growth and survival (22). Consistent with EPI-001 blocking the
androgen-AR axis, intravenous injection of EPI-001 significantly reduced the weight of benign prostates from noncastrated mature mice compared with control-treated animals
(22). EPI-001 also blocked the growth of prostate cancer
xenografts in the presence of androgen (noncastrated mature
male mice) and, most importantly, caused tumor regression of
CRPC. Male mice bearing LNCaP xenografts treated with EPI001 by i.v. injection had tumors that were less than half the
size of tumors in controls after only 2 weeks of treatment (22).
Consistent with EPI-001 having specificity for AR, EPI-001 had
no effect on PC3 human prostate cancer xenografts that are
insensitive to androgen and do not express functional AR (22).
These data support that EPI-001 is specific to the AR and does
not affect cells that do not depend on functional AR for growth
and survival. No toxicity was observed in animals treated
systemically with EPI-001 as determined by no loss of body
weight, no changes in behavior, and no pathologic changes in
the histology of internal organs (22). Pharmacokinetic studies
show that EPI-001 has 86% oral bioavailability. Therefore,
longer treatment periods can be obtained by oral dosing
rather than i.v. and should provide an indication if tumors
that express AR will completely regress in response to EPI-001.
EPI-001 inhibits constitutively active androgen
receptor lacking the ligand-binding domain
A potential mechanism for resistance to antiandrogens and
castration may involve expression of constitutively active splice
variants of AR that lack LBD. Increased expression of constitutively active AR splice variants that are devoid of LBD has
recently been described and is associated with earlier disease
recurrence and death (25, 26). Expression of constitutively active
AR occurs with high frequency in CRPC, and expression of these
variants increases in response to reduced tissue levels of androgen (27). This finding suggests that the androgen environment
plays a critical role in the expression of these variants. Further
reduction of prostate tissue levels of androgen by CYP17 inhibitors may result in elevated levels of expression of constitutively
active variant leading to CRPC and treatment failure. To date,
two different variants have been detected in clinical tissue,
ARv567es and ARV7/AR3 (25–27). Expression of ARv567es
was most commonly detected in approximately 43% of 46
metastases that expressed AR that were obtained from patients
who succumbed to CRPC (27). Transfection of ARv567es cDNA
yields tumors that are resistant to castration; however, the ratio
of expression of full-length AR to variant seems to be an
important indicator of tumor response to castration (27).

the AR LBD, was tested in LNCaP xenografts transfected with
AR-V7, such that these tumors should represent a mixed
population of full-length AR and variant (28). Unfortunately,
it was unclear whether there was, indeed, maintained expression
of the variant in vivo because none of the growth advantage in
response to castration was observed as reported by others with
expression of the variant. Western blot analysis using an antibody to the NTD cannot distinguish degraded full-length AR
from variant in the harvested tumors, and unfortunately, nontransfected tumors were not analyzed. Difficulty forcing expression of significant levels of AR-V7 protein seems to be a
challenge, thereby complicating interpretation of the in vivo
MDV3100 data in transfected LNCaP cells. Xenograft models
using human tumors that naturally express predominantly
ARv567es, such as LuCaP 86.2 (27), should provide a more
physiologically relevant approach for determining the effects
of MDV3100 and other AR antagonists on CRPC expressing AR
variant lacking the LBD. Because EPI-001 inhibits the AR NTD
and prevents essential N/C interaction of AR, it should directly
block the activity of these variants, as well as prevent interaction
of the variant with the full-length AR. Indeed, EPI-001 was
effective at blocking the activity of a constitutively active deletion mutant, ARI-653, which contains the NTD, DBD, and hinge
region, but not the LBD (22). It will be of interest to determine if
EPI-001 also inhibits naturally occurring splice variants and
mixtures of variant and full-length AR, as predicted from its
mechanism of action. If so, EPI-001 may be the first inhibitor
available for tumors that solely express variants, which occurs in
20% of metastases (27). Combination therapies using an antiandrogen, such as MDV3100 combined with EPI-001, may yield
synergistic or additive responses in patients who generally have
multiple tumors with varying ratios of full-length AR and
variants.

Future Directions
Although the discovery of androgen ablation therapy for the
treatment of prostate cancer was more than 50 years ago, there
is still continued drug development targeted at the AR and
androgen axis. Resurgence of interest in developing selective
CYP17 inhibitors and more potent antiandrogens is the result
of recent impressive clinical data being obtained from abiraterone and MDV3100. However, these inhibitors that ultimately interfere with AR LBD by either reducing ligand or
direct interaction also seem to eventually fail, and AR transactivation is resumed. The discovery of significant expression
of constitutively active splice variants of the AR lacking the LBD
in CRPC tissue emphasizes the urgency to develop inhibitors of
the AR NTD. EPI-001, sintokamides, and decoy AR1–558 each
target the AR NTD and have each shown significant inhibition
of AR with antitumor activity. Developing inhibitors to the
intrinsically disordered NTD provides a novel concept in the
field of steroid hormone receptor therapy, which has previously
concentrated on targeting the C-terminus LBD.
