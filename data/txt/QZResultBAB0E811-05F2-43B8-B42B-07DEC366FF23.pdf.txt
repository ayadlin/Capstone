Abstract
Recently, we could show that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-II antagonists induce apoptosis in human
endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo. In the present study, we have ascertained receptor
binding and effects of GnRH-II antagonists on mitogenic
signal transduction and on activation of proapoptotic protein
Bax. The GnRH-II antagonists tested showed EC50 values for
GnRH-I receptor binding in the range of 1 to 2 nmol/L. The
GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II showed an EC50 value for
GnRH-I receptor binding of f1,000 nmol/L. Agonistic activity
on GnRH-I receptor function with an EC50 of 13 nmol/L has
been determined for [D-Lys6]GnRH-II. Antagonistic activities
with EC50 values in the range of 1 nmol/L were determined for
the GnRH-II antagonists. Treatment of human endometrial,
ovarian, and breast cancer cells with GnRH-II antagonists
resulted in time-dependent activation of stress-induced
mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase. In addition, treatment with GnRH-II antagonists
induced time-dependent activation of proapoptotic protein
Bax. GnRH-II antagonists are not involved in activation of
protein kinase B/Akt or extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2. The GnRH-II antagonists tested had similar binding
affinities to the GnRH-I receptor comparable with that of
GnRH-I antagonist Cetrorelix. Referring to the cyclic AMP
response element reporter gene activation assay, the GnRH-II
agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II has to be classified as an agonist at
the GnRH-I receptor, whereas the GnRH-II antagonists tested
are clear antagonists at the GnRH-I receptor. GnRH-II
antagonists induce apoptotic cell death in human endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells via activation of stressinduced mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase followed by activation of proapoptotic
protein Bax. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6473–81]

Introduction
Expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-I and its
receptor as part of a negative autocrine/paracrine regulatory
mechanism of cell proliferation has been shown in several
malignant tumors, including cancers of endometrium, ovary, and

breast (1–5). Besides GnRH-I, a second structural variant of GnRH
exists in mammals. GnRH-II has antiproliferative effects on human
endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells, which are significantly greater than those of GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin (6).
Induction of apoptosis is not involved in down-regulation of
cancer cell proliferation induced by agonists of GnRH-I or GnRH-II
(1). GnRH-I and GnRH-II agonists rather inhibit mitogenic signal
transduction of growth factor receptors via activation of a
phosphotyrosine phosphatase resulting in down-regulation of
cancer cell proliferation (7–9).
Recently, we could show that antagonistic analogues of GnRH-II
induce apoptotic cell death in human endometrial (10), ovarian
(10), and breast cancer3 cells in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of
human endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells with GnRH-II
antagonists resulted in apoptotic cell death via dose-dependent
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of
caspase-3 (10). These antitumor effects could be confirmed in
nude mice. GnRH-II antagonists significantly inhibited the growth
of xenotransplants of human endometrial, ovarian, and breast
cancers in nude mice, without any apparent side effects (10).
GnRH-II antagonists appear to be suitable drugs for an
efficacious and less toxic endocrine therapy for endometrial,
ovarian, and breast cancers. To be able to further improve this
therapy as well as to expand the therapeutic concept on further
active agents and cancers, it is required to understand the
underlying mechanisms. Therefore, we now have ascertained
GnRH-I receptor binding of GnRH-II antagonists and assessed
their effects on GnRH-I receptor function. In addition, we have
analyzed the effects of GnRH-II antagonists on mitogenic signal
transduction pathways involved in induction of apoptosis in
human endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. cDNA encoding human GnRH-I
receptor was isolated from human pituitary cDNA library (MPI für
Biophysik) and expressed in LTK murine fibroblast cells. A single-cell clone
with stable and high expression of human GnRH-I receptor was selected. In
radioligand saturation binding experiments, GnRH antagonist Cetrorelix
showed high-affinity binding to heterologously expressed human GnRH-I
receptor with a K D of 0.1 nmol/L. The cell line generated is well suited for
determination of competitive binding characteristics of agonists and
antagonists of human GnRH-I receptor.
To assess functional implications of receptor binding by GnRH-I
competitive agents, a recombinant murine fibroblast LTK-based cell line
was established, which stably expressed human GnRH-I receptor and

luciferase reporter gene under control of a triple cyclic AMP response
element (CRE) sequence linked to cytomegalovirus minimal promoter.
GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin induced luciferase expression as monitored by
ATP bioluminescence detection in nanomolar range. The established cell
line is suitable to detect agonistic as well as antagonistic activities of human
GnRH-I receptor binding agents.
Human endometrial cancer cell lines Hec-1A, Hec-1B, and Ishikawa,
human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and EFO-21, and human breast
cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47-D were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection or the sources detailed previously (2, 3).
The cells were cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in
air as described previously (2–4).
GnRH analogues. GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II (pGlu-His-Trp-SerHis-D-Lys-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2) was synthesized by Peptide Specialty
Laboratories. GnRH-II antagonists [Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,D-Lys6,DAla10]GnRH-II, [Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,D-Lys6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II,
and [Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II were developed by
us and synthesized by Peptide Specialty Laboratories (10).
Receptor binding assay. For receptor binding studies, iodinated
Cetrorelix was used as tracer with f80% of peptide capable of specific
receptor association. Receptor binding assays were done with intact cells
under physiologic conditions (11). For displacement binding assays, cells
were incubated with f200 pmol/L [125I]Cetrorelix and different concentrations of unlabeled test compounds as competitor. Cell suspension in
binding medium was layered on top of silicon/paraffin oil, incubated for
60 min at 37jC, and separated by centrifugation. The tips of the tubes
containing cell pellet were cut off; subsequently, cell pellet and supernatant
were analyzed by g-radiation analysis. Amount of unspecific binding was
determined by including unlabeled Cetrorelix at 1 Amol/L final concentration and was typically V10% of total binding. EC50 values are calculated by
using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).
Functional CRE reporter gene activation assay. Cells were seeded
24 h before the experiment in medium supplemented with 1% FCS in white
clear-bottomed 96-well MTPs. Cells were incubated for 6 h with 1 nmol/L
Triptorelin and phosphodiesterase inhibitor Rolipram (antagonist mode) or
Rolipram alone (agonist mode) in the presence of different concentrations
of the test compound. Subsequently, cells were lysed and ATP bioluminescence was measured. Calculation of EC50 values was done by using
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).
Western blot analysis. Effects of GnRH-II antagonists on activation of
protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and stress-activated MAPKs
p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) were analyzed by Western blot.
Monoclonal mouse anti-human phospho-Akt, polyclonal rabbit antihuman Akt, polyclonal rabbit anti-human PTEN, polyclonal rabbit antihuman phospho-p38, polyclonal rabbit anti-human p38, polyclonal rabbit
anti-human phospho-p44/42, polyclonal rabbit anti-human p44/42, polyclonal rabbit anti-human phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK,
and polyclonal rabbit anti-human stress-activated protein kinase/JNK
antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human
c-Fos antibody was purchased from Abcam and polyclonal anti-human
h-actin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich.
For determination of GnRH-II antagonist-induced MAPK activity, cells
were treated without or with GnRH-II antagonists (10 7 mol/L) in a timedependent manner. To inhibit GnRH-II antagonist-induced MAPK activation, cells were pretreated (30 min) with p38 inhibitor SB203580 (1 Amol/L;
Promega), JNK inhibitor II SP600125 (1 Amol/L; Calbiochem), or pertussis
toxin (PTX; 20 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and then treated for 45 min with
GnRH-II antagonist.
After incubation, cells were detached immediately with 0.5 g trypsin
(Biochrom) and 5 mmol EDTA in 1 liter PBS/bovine serum albumin. Pellets
were washed twice with PBS and resuspended with CelLytic buffer (Sigma)
containing protease inhibitors (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein per
sample (40 Ag) were used and diluted to equal volumes with Laemmli
buffer. Cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE (10%, ProSieve 50 Gel
Solution; Cambrex) under reducing conditions and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL; GE Healthcare). The nitrocellulose

membranes were blocked with 5% instant skimmed milk powder, spraydried (Naturaflor; Töpfer) in TBST [137 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 0.1%
Tween 20, 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)] for 1 h at room temperature,
washed with TBST, and incubated at 4jC overnight with the appropriate
antibody in an 1:500 (anti-h-actin) or an 1:1,000 dilution in TBST and then,
following washings, incubated at room temperature with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare
Europe) at an 1:10,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h. After washings, specifically
bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(Millipore). The bands were analyzed using the one-dimensional image
system (Kodak).
Immunoprecipitation. Effects of GnRH-II antagonists on activation of
Bax were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot.
Monoclonal mouse anti-human Bax antibodies 6A7 and 2D2, which
recognize activated and total Bax, respectively, were obtained from Sigma.
For determination of levels of activated Bax, cells were treated with
GnRH-II antagonist (10 7 mol/L) in time-dependent manner. Freshly
harvested cells were resuspended with CelLytic buffer (Sigma) containing
phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma). Protein G Sepharose was
washed twice with water, equilibrated with Laemmli buffer for 15 min,
incubated with anti-Bax antibody 2D2 (1:500) for 1 h, and then washed
twice again with Laemmli buffer. Equal amounts of protein (80 Ag) were
added to each tube and further incubated for additional 1 h to facilitate
immunoprecipitation. Proteins bound to protein G Sepharose were washed
three times with Laemmli buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins.
After final centrifugation, proteins bound to protein G Sepharose were
dissolved in Laemmli buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE as described above,
and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above using anti-Bax
antibody 6A7 (1:500).

Results
GnRH-I receptor binding of GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II
and GnRH-II antagonists. All four substances analyzed showed
significant activity in the competitive binding assay (Fig. 1A).
GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II showed an EC50 for GnRH-I
receptor binding of 25.63 nmol/L. For comparison, a former duplicate analysis of native GnRH-II under identical assay conditions
revealed EC50 values of 49 and 102 nmol/L (data not shown).
GnRH-II antagonist [Ac- D -2Nal 1 , D -4Cpa 2 , D -3Pal 3 , D -Lys 6 , D Ala10]GnRH-II had an EC50 of 0.52 nmol/L, GnRH-II antagonist
[Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,D-Lys6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II showed an
EC50 of 0.76 nmol/L, and GnRH-II antagonist [Ac-D-2Nal1,D4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II had an EC50 of 0.66 nmol/L.
Effects of GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II and antagonist
[Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II on GnRH-I
receptor function. Agonistic activity with an EC50 of 13 nmol/L
has been determined for GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II (Fig. 1B).
GnRH-II antagonist [Ac- D -2Nal 1 , D -4Cpa 2 , D -3Pal 3 , 6 ,Leu 8 , D Ala10]GnRH-II showed no activity with respect to functional CRE
activation by the human GnRH-I receptor. Antagonistic activity
with an EC50 of 1.5 nmol/L was determined for GnRH-II antagonist
[Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II (Fig. 1C). No
antagonistic activity was observed for GnRH-II agonist
[D-Lys6]GnRH-II. Experiments using GnRH-II antagonists [Ac-D2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,D-Lys6,D-Ala10]GnRH-II and [Ac-D-2Nal1,D4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,D-Lys6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II gave comparable results
with that of GnRH-II antagonist [Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D-3Pal3,6,
Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II (data not shown). Because all GnRH-II
antagonists show the same activity on GnRH-I receptor binding
and function and, in addition, have the same antitumor activity
in vitro and in vivo, we have selected [Ac-D-2Nal1,D-4Cpa2,D3Pal3,6,Leu8,D-Ala10]GnRH-II for further use.

The Akt pathway was not affected by the GnRH-II antagonist.
To examine whether the MAPK ERK1/2 signaling pathway is

by GnRH-II antagonists, we treated MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells, OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells, and Ishikawa human
endometrial cancer cells with the GnRH-II antagonist (10 7 mol/L)
in a time-dependent manner and analyzed the amount of phosphoJNK (Fig. 3) and phospho-p38 (Fig. 3B). After GnRH-II antagonist
treatment, phospho-JNK was increased in MCF-7 human breast

(Fig. 3A, middle), and Ishikawa human endometrial cancer cells
(Fig. 3A, bottom). Maximal JNK activation was observed 30 min
(MCF-7, Fig. 3A, top) or 45 min (OVCAR-3, Fig. 3A, middle;

phosphorylation in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (Fig. 3B, top),
OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 3B, middle), and Ishikawa
human endometrial cancer cells (Fig. 3B, bottom). In all three cell

antagonist-induced activation of p38 and JNK, the tumor cells were
pretreated with p38 inhibitor SB203580 or JNK inhibitor SP600125.
GnRH-II antagonist (10 7 mol/L) treatment resulted in an increase

pretreated with PTX. Neither GnRH-II antagonist-induced activation of p38 nor GnRH-II antagonist-induced activation of JNK were
inhibited by pretreatment with PTX, indicating that these effects of
the GnRH-II antagonist are not mediated through PTX-sensitive G

OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells (data not shown), and
Ishikawa human endometrial cancer cells (data not shown) with
the GnRH-II antagonist (10 7 mol/L) in a time-dependent manner
and analyzed the amount of activated Bax monomers and
homodimers. After GnRH-II antagonist treatment, the amount of
Bax homodimers was time-dependently increased, whereas the
amount of Bax monomers was decreased in all three cell lines.
Maximal Bax homodimerization was observed 240 min after
GnRH-II antagonist treatment and remained constant after that.

Discussion
Previous work showed that already nanomolar concentrations of
GnRH-II antagonists induce apoptotic cell death in human
endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
via dose-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and
activation of caspase-3 (10). To improve the GnRH-II antagonist
therapy as well as to be able to expand the therapeutic concept on
further active agents and other cancers, we tried to learn more
about the underlying mechanisms. Now we have ascertained the
effects of GnRH-II antagonists on mitogenic signal transduction
and activation of proapoptotic protein Bax in human endometrial,

ovarian, and breast cancer cells. In addition, we have assessed
GnRH-I receptor binding and functional implications of GnRH-I
receptor binding by GnRH-II antagonists.
We could show that in human endometrial, ovarian, and breast
cancer cells GnRH-II antagonists induce apoptosis through
activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. GnRH-II antagonists
interact with the signaling pathway of MAPKs by time-dependent
activation of the stress-induced MAPKs p38 and JNK. Pretreatment
with p38 inhibitor SB203580 prevented the GnRH-II antagonistinduced increase of activated p38 and pretreatment with JNK
inhibitor SP600125 prevented the GnRH-II antagonist-induced
increase of activated JNK. It is known that activation of p38 is
associated with induction of apoptosis. p38 can cause phosphorylation of Bax and thus induces translocation of activated Bax to the
mitochondrial membrane (12, 13). This mechanism could also be
shown for JNK in hepatocytes (12, 14). Harris and Johnson could
show JNK-dependent induction of apoptosis via phosphorylation of
Bax in neurons (15). In the present study, we could show that these
mechanisms are also involved in GnRH-II antagonist-induced
apoptosis. After GnRH-II antagonist treatment, the amount of
activated Bax homodimers was time-dependently increased. Gross
and colleagues have shown that the conformational change in Bax
after activation manifests in its homodimerization, translocation,
and mitochondrial membrane insertion (16). Activation of the
stress-induced MAPKs JNK and p38 followed by activation and
homodimerization of the proapoptotic protein Bax seem to play an
important role in induction of apoptosis by GnRH-II antagonists
(Fig. 5B). By moving the balance from antiapoptotic to proapoptotic
signals (Bad, Bax), the mitochondrial membrane is permeabilized

MAPKs JNK (A) and p38 (B ) in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (top ), OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells (middle), and Ishikawa human endometrial cancer
cells (bottom ). Controls were treated with PBS. h-actin was used as loading control marker. After GnRH-II antagonist (10 7 mol/L) treatment, phosphorylated JNK
was increased in all 3 cell lines (A). Maximal JNK activation was observed 30 min (MCF-7, A, top ) or 45 min (OVCAR-3, A, middle ; Ishikawa, A, bottom ) after
treatment and decreased after that again. In some cases, a second maximum 90 min after treatment was detectable in the OVCAR-3 cell line (A, middle ). GnRH-II
antagonist (10 7 mol/L) treatment resulted in an increase of p38 phosphorylation in all three cell lines (B ). Maximal p38 activation was reached 45 min after treatment
and remained constant after that. These are representative data obtained from three independent experiments in three different passages of each cell line.

GnRH-II antagonist treatment with or without inhibitor
pretreatment. Neither GnRH-II antagonist-induced

activation of the effector caspase-3, which in turn activates the
effector caspase-7 (17). Antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-1 and
Bcl-xL are located on the outer membrane of the mitochondria and
inhibit the release of cytochrome c. Proapoptotic proteins such as
Bad and Bax are located within the cytosol and are recruited to the
mitochondria after induction of death signaling where they induce
cytochrome c release by channel formation within the mitochondrial membrane (18).
Several groups including ours have reported in the past that
antiproliferative actions of GnRH-I analogues were inhibited by
pretreatment with PTX, indicating that these effects are mediated
through PTX-sensitive G protein ai/o (1, 8, 19–21). It is different
with GnRH-II antagonists. Here, we found that neither GnRH-II
antagonist-induced activation of p38 nor GnRH-II antagonistinduced activation of JNK was inhibited by pretreatment with PTX,
indicating that these effects of GnRH-II antagonists are not

mediated through PTX-sensitive G protein ai/o. Recently, we had
reported that GnRH-II antagonist-induced caspase-3 activity was
slightly reduced by PTX pretreatment (10). Therefore, we had
speculated that these effects of GnRH-II antagonists might be
mediated through PTX-sensitive G protein ai/o. However, the
inhibiting effects of PTX pretreatment on GnRH-II antagonistinduced caspase-3 activity were very small and not significant (10).
White and colleagues have recently reported that coupling of the
GnRH-I receptor to G protein aq/11, but not to G protein ai/o or G
protein as, and consequent activation of ERK plays a crucial role in
GnRH-mediated growth inhibition (22). In contrast, Maudsley and
colleagues have shown that GnRH-I antagonists promote
proapoptotic signaling in peripheral reproductive tumor cells by
activating a G protein ai-coupling state of GnRH-I receptor (19).
Morgan and colleagues have recently reported that differences in
levels of GnRH-I receptor and signaling differentially affect the

apoptotic machinery within cell lines and contribute to the cell
type–specific effects of GnRH analogues on growth (23). In our cell
lines, GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin and GnRH-I antagonist Cetrorelix
induce antiproliferative effects by activating a G protein aicoupling state of GnRH-I receptor (8), whereas induction of
apoptosis by GnRH-II antagonists is G protein ai independent. The
differences regarding G protein coupling seem to depend on ligand
and cell context.
PKB/Akt plays an important role in the balance between
surviving and death (apoptosis) of a cell (24). It could already be
shown that PKB/Akt can inhibit induction of apoptosis by
phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad on Ser136 (25).
Therapy of leiomyoma with GnRH-I agonist Leuprorelin leads to a
reduction of volume (26). It could be shown that the amount of
phospho-Akt was reduced resulting in an increase of phospho-Bad.
It is suspected that these effects lead to induction of apoptosis
because the antiapoptotic proteins FLIP and PED/PEA15 are also
inhibited (27). Treatment of prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and
LNCaP with GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin resulted in induction of
apoptosis via inhibition of PKB/Akt (28). It must be taken into
account, however, that in both cell lines the basal amounts of
activated PKB/Akt are very high (29). The reduction of PKB/
Akt activity seems to be linked to mitogenic signaling because
the stress-activated MAPK JNK is activated after treatment with

GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin. PKB/Akt is able to regulate JNK
signaling by different mechanisms (30). In human endometrial
cancer cell line Ishikawa and human ovarian cancer cell line EFO21, we found overactivation of PKB/Akt due to inactivating PTEN
mutations. In both cell lines, no effect of GnRH-II antagonist
treatment on PKB/Akt expression and activation was detectable.
The PKB/Akt pathway was not affected by GnRH-II antagonists.
Apoptosis also could be induced in the other cell lines used in which
basal activity of PKB/Akt is not increased. In aT3-1 pituitary cells,
it could be shown that the GnRH-I agonist-induced reduction
of insulin-like growth factor–induced activation of PKB/Akt could
be restored by GnRH-I antagonists (31). PKB/Akt does not play a
relevant role in induction of apoptosis by GnRH-II antagonists.
Although GnRH analogues interact with phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-PKB/Akt signaling in gynecologic cancer cells, this seems
only to apply to agonists and not to antagonists.
Activation of ERK1/2 by GnRH-I and GnRH-II agonists was
shown in ovarian cancer cells (32–34). GnRH-I antagonist Antide
was shown to inhibit these GnRH-I and GnRH-II agonist-induced
ERK1/2 activation (33). Our group found that epidermal growth
factor–induced ERK1/2 activation was inhibited by GnRH-I
agonist Triptorelin, GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II, and
GnRH-I antagonist Cetrorelix (9, 35, 36). In the present study,
we could show that GnRH-II antagonists are not involved in

proapoptotic protein Bax in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Upper bands represent Bax homodimers (42 kDa) and lower bands represent Bax monomers (21 kDa).
After GnRH-II antagonist treatment, the amount of Bax homodimers (42 kDa) was time-dependently increased whereas the amount of Bax monomers (21 kDa)
was decreased. After 30 min of GnRH-II antagonist treatment, Bax monomers were not detectable anymore. These are representative data obtained from three
independent experiments in three different passages of the cell line. Experiments using OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells or Ishikawa human endometrial
cancer cells gave identical results. B, schematic representation of GnRH-II antagonist signaling in human ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer cells. GnRH-II

ERK1/2 activation. The involvement of the ERK1/2 pathway in
apoptotic signaling is also a very rare process because activation
of ERK1/2 normally leads to proliferation (37).
In the present study, we could show that all three GnRH-II
antagonists tested have a high binding affinity to the GnRH-I
receptor comparable with that of the GnRH-I antagonist Cetrorelix.
The GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II has a considerably lower
binding affinity to the GnRH-I receptor. It is possible that
[D-Lys6]GnRH-II has a higher affinity to the putative GnRH-II
receptor. However, GnRH-II agonist-induced activation of the
GnRH-I receptor could already be confirmed (33). Referring to
the CRE reporter gene activation assay, the GnRH-II agonist
[D-Lys6]GnRH-II has to be classified as an agonist at the GnRH-I
receptor, whereas the GnRH-II antagonists tested are clear
antagonists at the GnRH-I receptor. These results may indicate
that GnRH-II analogues act via the GnRH-I receptor. However,
after knockdown of GnRH-I receptor expression, the GnRH-II
antagonist-induced activation of p38 was only slightly reduced,
indicating that the antitumor effects of GnRH-II antagonists are
not exclusively mediated through the GnRH-I receptor.3 An
additional pathway such as the putative GnRH-II receptor may
be responsible for GnRH-II antagonist-induced apoptosis. The
GnRH-I receptor binding assays were carried out using pituitary
cells and fibroblasts. Therefore, we cannot confirm a complete
antagonism in tumor cells because the GnRH signal transduction is
cell context dependent (38). However, it cannot be ruled out that
GnRH-II antagonists-induced apoptosis is mediated through the
GnRH-I receptor. It would be very interesting to know whether
GnRH-II antagonist-induced activation of p38 and subsequent of
apoptosis would be abrogated after knockdown of expression of
the putative additional receptor for GnRH. Different knockdown
experiments, however, using GnRH-II receptor antisense fragments
resulted in apoptotic cell death.3 In addition, binding assays and

functional assays for the putative GnRH-II receptor are not
available at the moment. For additional studies, human tumor
cells transfected with the well-known marmoset monkey GnRH-II
receptor could be used, although the human putative GnRH-II
receptor is different to the marmoset monkey GnRH-II receptor. It
is supposed that, if the putative human GnRH-II receptor exists,
it is shortened with only five transmembrane domains, whereas
the marmoset monkey GnRH-II receptor is seven-transmembrane
domain receptor (39, 40). At present, therefore, this question cannot
be answered.
In conclusion, we could show that GnRH-II antagonists induce
apoptotic cell death in human endometrial, ovarian, and breast
cancer cells already in nanomolar doses. Apoptosis induced by
GnRH-II antagonists is mediated through the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway via stress-induced MAPKs p38- and JNK-induced activation of the proapoptotic protein Bax, loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of
caspase-3. In addition we could show that GnRH-II antagonists
couple to the GnRH-I receptor and are clear antagonists at the
GnRH-I receptor.
