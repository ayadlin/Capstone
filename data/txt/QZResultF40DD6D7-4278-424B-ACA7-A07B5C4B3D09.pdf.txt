ABSTRACT
Radiotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased incidence of
secondary bladder cancer (BC). We investigated the incidence, clinicopathological
characteristics, and prognosis of BC after radiotherapy, surgical therapy, and primary
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. This study included 1,334
Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (n=631), surgical
therapy (n=437), and primary ADT (n=266). During the median follow-up period of
51.2, 44.8, and 45.5 months, secondary BC occurred in 14 (2.2%), 5 (1.1%), and 0
(0%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy, surgical therapy,
and primary ADT, respectively. The 10-year BC-free survival rate was 91.3% in the
radiotherapy group, 97.4% in the surgical therapy group, and 100% in the primary
ADT group. The rates of intravesical recurrence, progression to muscle-invasive BC,
and BC-specific death might be higher in secondary BC after radiotherapy compared
with after surgical therapy. There was a significant difference in the incidence of
secondary BC among different therapeutic modalities for prostate cancer in Japanese
men, indicating significantly lower comorbidity rates of secondary BC after primary
ADT for prostate cancer compared with radiotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

(EBRT) and/or brachytherapy (BT). Additionally,
salvage radiotherapy is a common therapeutic option
for biochemical recurrence after RP along with salvage
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). In contrast, ADT
inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) signaling by either
surgical or medical castration and/or anti-androgen
agents is the gold standard for advanced or metastatic
prostate cancer. Among these therapeutic modalities,
physicians and patients can choose the best single option
or combination. As patients with prostate cancer are
expected to live longer compared with those with other
cancers, late-phase adverse events are more meaningful
and critical. There are increasing numbers of prostate
cancer survivors with severe, long-lasting adverse events
resulting from prostate cancer therapy. However, although
numerous studies have reported the oncological outcomes
using these modalities, reports on adverse events,
especially late-phase events, are relatively limited.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers
among men of developed countries. In the United States,
it is estimated that about 233,000 men will develop, and
about 29,480 men will die, from prostate cancer in 2014
[1]. In Japan, the morbidity rate of prostate cancer has
been increasing owing to various reasons, including the
growing prevalence of a Western-style diet and lifestyle,
and an increase in the aging population as well as prostate
specific antigen (PSA) screening [2].
For prostate cancer, several therapeutic modalities
are available and apply to patients with prostate cancer
according to various clinicopathological parameters.
Standard treatment options for localized prostate
cancer include: radical prostatectomy (RP) by open RP,
laparoscopic RP, or robot-assisted laparoscopic RP; and
prostate radiotherapy by external beam radiotherapy

Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common
urogenital cancers, usually characterized as urothelial
carcinoma. In the United States, it is estimated that about
74,690 people will develop BC and about 15,580 people
will die from BC in 2014 [1]. Previously, a relationship
between prostate cancer and BC has been suggested.
Etiologically, the high incidence of double primary
cancer (prostate cancer and BC) has been reported
[3], which is supported by the biological findings that
common molecular pathways, such as androgen receptor
(AR) signaling, contributes to the carcinogenesis and
tumorigenesis of prostate cancer as well as BC [4, 5].
However, diagnostic bias and other factors, such as
smoking and metabolic syndrome, are confounding
variables of this relationship [6]. In reports from the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident in Ukraine,
ionizing radiation was shown to induce DNA damage
and gene mutations leading to urothelial dysplasia [7, 8].
In addition to mutagenesis of epithelial cells caused by
irradiation, more recently, the irradiated microenvironment
has also been recognized to promote the tumorigenesis
through tumor growth factor (TGF)-β signaling [9]. It
has been reported that the incidence of secondary BC,
which is one of most critical adverse events, increases
after radiotherapy for prostate cancer, likely owing to
mutagenicity by radiation [10].
However, the hypothesis that radiotherapy may
increase secondary BC is vague because most studies
lack a comparable approach or rely on community-based
registry databases that have strong statistical power but
less reliability and data accuracy. Moreover, reports on
secondary BC have been derived from mostly North
American data. Additionally, the comorbid rate of
secondary BC when treated with ADT for prostate cancer
is unknown. Therefore, in this study, the incidence of BC
comorbid with prostate cancer was investigated using
single institution data according to prostate anticancer
treatment, including radiotherapy, surgical therapy,
and primary ADT. In addition, the clinicopathological
characteristics and prognosis of secondary BC among
therapeutical modalities for prostate cancer were
evaluated.

respectively, while only a few or none of the patients
treated with radiotherapy or surgical therapy had lymph
node or distant metastases, respectively. Thus, compared
with patients treated with radiotherapy and surgical
therapy, patients treated with ADT were older and had
worse characteristics, such as higher PSA values at
diagnosis, higher Gleason scores, and more progressive
TNM-stage, indicating an appropriate indication for
primary ADT to treat advanced prostate cancer in this
cohort.
The cancer comorbid with prostate cancer was
categorically divided into preceding, concurrent, and
subsequent cancer according to the timing of diagnosis;
cancer 1 year before or after prostate cancer diagnosing
was defined as preceding or subsequent cancer,
respectively, while cancer diagnosed within 1 year before
or after diagnosis with prostate cancer was defined as
concurrent cancer. As shown in Table 2, among these
1,334 patients, 49 cases of comorbid BC were diagnosed
in 10 (0.7%), 20 (1.5%), and 19 (1.4%) men with
preceding, concurrent, and subsequent BC, respectively.
With regard to therapeutic modalities, 23 men (3.6%), 11
men (2.5%), and 15 men (5.6%) among patients treated
with radiotherapy, surgical therapy, and primary ADT,
were diagnosed with BC, respectively. Focusing on
secondary BC, after excluding preceding and concurrent
BC, during the median follow-up period of 51.2 (IQR,
27.4–75.9) months, 14 men (2.2%) among patients treated
with radiotherapy were diagnosed with secondary BC
with a median latency of 52.3 (IQR, 16.6–68.0) months.
Conversely, during the median follow-up period of 44.8
(IQR, 24.4–77.7) and 45.5 (IQR, 26.1–71.3) months,
five (1.1%) men or no men among patients treated with
surgical treatment or ADT were diagnosed with secondary
BC with a median latency of 65.8 (IQR, 19.8–116.0)
months, respectively. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 1A,
the 10-year BC-free survival rate was 91.3%, 97.4%, and
100% among patients treated with radiotherapy, surgical
therapy, and ADT, respectively (P = 0.020; radiotherapy
vs. surgical therapy, P = 0.11; radiotherapy vs. ADT, P
= 0.016: surgical therapy vs. ADT, P = 0.090). Thus, the
incidence of secondary BC was higher among patients
treated with radiotherapy although statistical significance
was not reached, while, surprisingly, the incidence of
secondary BC was significantly lower among patients
treated with ADT. Because docetaxel chemotherapy might
affect the occurrence of secondary BC, the comorbid rate
of secondary BC was only compared among patients
without docetaxel chemotherapy. Although docetaxel
chemotherapy was administered to one (0.2%), two
(0.5%), and 31 men (11.7%) in radiotherapy, surgical
therapy, and ADT groups, respectively, the conclusion
was similar even when these cases were excluded (data not
shown). According to therapeutic radiotherapy modality,
during the median follow-up period of 54.7 (IQR, 30.5–
73.8), 72.3 (IQR, 57.5–88.6), 45.2 (IQR, 23.1–74.1), and

RESULTS
This study enrolled a total of 1,334 patients, whose
clinical and pathological characteristics are shown in
Table 1. The median age of patients was 71, 65, and 74
years and the median PSA at diagnosis was 9.0, 7.7, and
48.0 ng/mL among radiotherapy, surgical therapy, and
ADT groups, respectively. The Gleason scores of biopsy
specimens from 119 (18.9%) patients, 64 (14.6%) patients,
and 134 (50.4%) patients treated with radiotherapy,
surgical therapy, or ADT, respectively, were >7. Among
patients treated with ADT, 102 (34.7%) and 139 (47.3%)
men had regional lymph node and/or distant metastases,

52.1 (IQR, 31.8–83.5) months, 8-year BC-free survival
rates were 98.0%, 100%, 94.8%, and 97.4% in BT, BT
+ EBRT, EBRT, and salvage EBRT groups, respectively
(Fig. 1B). Thus, the incidence of secondary BC was higher
in the EBRT group compared with BT, BT + EBRT, and
salvage EBRT groups, although statistical significance was
not reached (P = 0.357). Moreover, because neoadjuvant/
adjuvant ADT was used with EBRT, the comorbid rate of
secondary BC was examined between EBRT with ADT (n
= 239) or without ADT (n = 102), which showed similar
BC-free survival rates (Fig. 1C).
Finally, the clinicopathological characteristics of
secondary BC among patients treated with radiotherapy
or surgical therapy was investigated. Among the
clinicopathological parameters listed in Table 3, tumor
site, tumor number, tumor size, carcinoma in situ (CIS),
histological grade, and local stage were comparable
between patients treated with radiotherapy and surgical
therapy, although urothelial carcinoma in prostatic
urethra characteristically occurred in two cases treated
with radiotherapy. However, as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 1 and Table 3, among patients with non-MIBC (n =
15), intravesical recurrence-free survival rate (P = 0.32),
progression to muscle-invasive BC-free survival rate (P
= 0.40), and BC-specific survival rate (P = 0.42) were
inferior in those treated with radiotherapy compared with
patients treated with surgical therapy, although statistical
significance was not reached. Notably, three (0.5%) men
treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer died from
BC; however, nine (1.4%) patients in the radiotherapy
series died from prostate cancer.

increased risk of BC after radiotherapy compared with
surgical treatment for prostate cancer using the Cancer
of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor
(CaPSURE) database including about 10,000 cases of
prostate cancer [17]. Additionally, Pawlish et al., using the
Detroit SEER database [18], showed a significant increase
in secondary BC risk following radiotherapy. However,
in contrast, several studies using smaller cohorts failed to
show a significant increased risk of secondary BC. For
instance, Chrouser et al. at the Mayo Clinic [19], Movsas
et al. at the Fox Chase Cancer Center [20], and Pickles
et al. using the British Columbia Tumor Registry [21]
reported no risk change in incidence after radiotherapy.
Consistent with these controversial previous studies, the
present study showed only a marginal increased risk of
secondary BC after radiotherapy for prostate cancer when
compared with surgical therapy probably because of the
small sample size, but significant when compared with
primary ADT.
Previously, a differential effect on secondary BC by
distinct radiotherapy modalities has been proposed. Liauw
et al. reported secondary BC after BT alone or combined
with EBRT at the Seattle Prostate Institute, showing a
decreased risk of secondary BC after BT alone compared
with BT combined with EBRT [22]. Moreover, Moon et al.
showed a similar result using data from the SEER registry
in that BT did not affect the incidence of secondary BC
compared with EBRT [13]. Based on these findings, it is
possible that decreased irradiation dose to the bladder may
contribute to reducing the risk of secondary BC. In the
present study, we showed a decreased risk of secondary
BC after BT compared with EBRT, although statistical
significance was not reached likely because of the small
sample size.
Surgery for prostate cancer reportedly does not
increase secondary BC risk, as reported by studies using
the SEER database [12, 15, 16]. With regard to ADT,
there are no reports investigating secondary BC. In this
study, unexpectedly and surprisingly, the cohort treated
with primary ADT was at a significantly lower risk of
secondary BC compared with radiotherapy, irrespective
of older age among the primary ADT series, which
is an established risk factor for secondary BC [16].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report

DISCUSSION
It has been suggested that radiotherapy for prostate
cancer can induce secondary BC. Using community-based
registry databases, several studies have shown an increased
incidence of secondary BC after radiotherapy for prostate
cancer. Studies using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) database-which includes hundreds of
thousands of prostate cancer cases-indicate that BC risk
increases after radiotherapy for prostate cancer compared
with the non-radiotherapy group, such as surgery and no
treatment [11-16]. Similarly, Boorjian et al. reported an

of the comorbidity rate of secondary BC after ADT,
suggesting that ADT might reduce the risk comorbid with
secondary BC by suppressing urothelial carcinogenesis
and tumorigenesis. Previously, AR signaling has been
suggested to be involved in the carcinogenesis and
tumorigenesis of the prostate as well as the urothelium
[4, 23]. It is consistently reported that AR signaling
promotes DNA breaks and chromosomal rearrangement,
leading to the emergence of oncogenic fusion-genes [24,
25]. We have also recently shown that androgen depletion
and AR knockdown suppressed cell proliferation in BC
expressing ARs [5]. Taken together, these biological
findings may account for the lower comorbidity rate
of secondary BC among men treated with ADT in this
study. Furthermore, Izumi et al. has recently reported
that ADT for prostate cancer concurrent with non-MIBC
can reduce intravesical recurrence rate of BC, supporting
the results of this study from a clinical perspective [26].
Conversely, the comorbid rate of secondary BC after
radiotherapy was similar between patients who did or
did not undergo ADT, suggesting that ADT might affect
usual bladder carcinogenesis, but not irradiation-induced
bladder carcinogenesis, or the relatively short period of
neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT was not sufficient to prevent
bladder carcinogenesis.
Radiotherapy, and especially EBRT for prostate
cancer, may increase the risk of secondary BC. However,
the clinicopathological characteristics of secondary BC
remain unclear. In this study, several characteristics of
secondary BC after radiotherapy have been reported,
which includes a higher possibility of urothelial tumor in
the prostate, intravesical recurrence, progression to MIBC,
and BC-specific death, although statistical significance
was not reached, likely because of the small sample size.
Similarly, Cherouser et al. reported frequent recurrence
and progression of secondary BC after radiotherapy for
prostate cancer [19]. Moreover, Bostrom et al. showed
worse prognosis comparing data from patients after
radiotherapy for prostate cancer compared with a matched
control group [27]. Additionally, Abern et al. reported a
higher incidence of non-urothelial carcinoma, trigonallocated cancer, CIS, and BC-specific death using SEER
database [28]. In line with these studies, higher BC grade
and stage after radiotherapy has been reported from the
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Tumor Registry
[29, 30] and the University of Miami [27, 31]. Also, in in
vitro experiments, irradiation has been shown to promote
the progression from low-grade urothelial cancer to highgrade cancer [32]. Thus, secondary BC might occur in a
region near the prostate, and have high-risk properties of
recurrence and lethal progression, as shown in this study.
Conversely, the worse prognosis may be derived from
the pre-history of radiotherapy to prostate, which limited
the subsequent surgical therapy for BC, such as radical
cystectomy.
The present study had several limitations. For
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

instance, the study design was retrospective, the sample
size was relatively small, and the follow-up period was
relatively short. Despite these limitations, this study
showed a significant difference in the incidence of
secondary BC among therapeutic modalities for prostate
cancer in a single institution. However, detection bias by
symptoms such as gross-hematuria and bladder irritation,
which are often caused by radiotherapy, and short life
expectancy due to patient characteristics in the ADT
group may have affected the results. Selection bias of
therapy for prostate cancer may also have affected the
results. Radiation-induced malignancies usually occur
more than 4–5 years after therapy, but our study included
six cases with secondary BC that occurred within 4 years.
In addition, the lack of data pertaining to smoking status
is another limitation of this study. Conversely, this study
included a cohort from the urological department from
only one institution, assuring high integrity of the data, in
contrast to data from community-based databases.

CONCLUSION
This study showed a significant difference in the
incidence and possible differences in clinicopathological
characteristics and prognosis of secondary BC among
different therapeutic modalities for prostate cancer in
Japanese men treated in a single institution; we show a
significantly lower comorbidity rate of secondary BC after
ADT for prostate cancer. Thus, this study has opened up
the new possibility that ADT might clinically suppress
BC occurrence. Accordingly, further exploration of the
aforementioned possibility is warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study enrolled patients with prostate cancer
treated by radiotherapy, surgical therapy, or primary ADT
at Kyushu University Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan) from
2000 to 2012. This study was approved by the Kyushu
University Hospital institutional review board. All patients
were histopathologically diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
of the prostate. Patients with less than 1 year followup after therapy were excluded. Clinical staging was
determined in accordance with the unified TNM criteria
based on the results of a digital rectal examination,
transrectal ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, and bone scan [33]. Most patients
also underwent cystoscopy to determine tumor extension
and to rule out comorbid BC. Patients in the radiotherapy
series were treated by brachytherapy (BT), EBRT, BT +
EBRT, or salvage EBRT with or without neoadjuvant/
adjuvant ADT (more than 3 months) by surgical castration
or medical castration using a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprorelin
acetate) and/or an antiandrogen agent (bicalutamide,
flutamide, or chlormadinone acetate). BT [34], EBRT [35,
14716

Oncotarget

36], and salvage EBRT [37] were performed as described
previously. Briefly, BT was performed using permanent
implantation of 125I. For BT + EBRT, 45 Gy of EBRT to
prostate was added after BT. EBRT was performed with
a median 72 (interquartile range [IQR], 70–72) Gy to the
prostate only (n = 294, 84.5%) or the prostate and pelvis (n
= 48, 13.8%) by conformal (n = 312, 89.7%) or intensitymodulated radiotherapy (n = 30, 8.6%). Salvage EBRT
was conducted with a median 66 (IQR, 64.8–66) Gy to
the prostatic bed (n = 58, 90.6%) or pelvis (n = 6, 9.4%)
by conformal (n = 63, 98.4%) or intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (n = 1, 1.6%). Patients in the surgical
therapy series were treated by open RP, laparoscopic RP,
robot-assisted laparoscopic LP, or radical cystectomy
with or without ADT [6]. Patients who received salvage
radiotherapy were excluded from the surgical therapy
series. Patients in the ADT series were primarily treated
with ADT because of metastasized disease, advanced age,
severe comorbidity, low performance status or patient
preference. Patients who received surgical therapy or
radiotherapy for prostate cancer were excluded from the
ADT series. Patients were followed up during or after
treatment for prostate cancer at intervals of about 3–6
months with medical interview, urinalysis, and blood test.
If BC incidence was suspected, further examinations, such
as urine cytology and cystoscopy, were performed. The
time to development of secondary cancer was defined as
the duration from the date of principal therapeutic start
for prostate cancer to the date of pathological diagnosis of
secondary cancer.
Primary BC, but not recurrent BC, was included in
this study. All comorbid BC were histologically confirmed.
Pathological evaluation of BC was performed according
to 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) grading [38].
In this study, urothelial carcinoma in prostatic urethra
was included in the BC cohort. Clinical staging of BC
was determined in accordance with the unified TNM
criteria based on the results of a bimanual examination,
transurethral resection, computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, and bone scan [33]. The time to
intravesical recurrence, progression to muscle-invasive
bladder cancer (MIBC), or BC-specific death was defined
as the duration from the date of pathological diagnosis of
secondary cancer to the date of intravesical recurrence,
progression to MIBC, or BC-specific death, respectively.
All statistical analyses were performed using JMP9
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The survival
rates were determined using the Kaplan–Meier method
and the log-rank statistic was used to compare survival
duration across groups. Comparisons between groups were
analyzed by Wilcoxon or Pearson tests. P-values < 0.05
were considered significant.
