BACKGROUND. Underrepresentation of older patients in cancer clinical trials has
been reported previously.

METHODS. To evaluate disparities in age between actual cancer patients and
those enrolled in clinical trials, the authors examined all the review reports of the
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, Tokyo, Japan, and summaries of
data submitted by applicants for the approval of new cancer drugs and that of a
partial change in approved cancer drugs.

RESULTS. Information regarding 68 clinical trials was available on the Internet.
The median age of trial participants ranged from 33 years to 73 years and was

agents (16 trials) and hormonal agents (10 trials), trial participants were younger
than the patient population in 25 of the 26 trials, with a median difference of
6 years (range, –9.5 to 120). The difference was larger for molecular-targeting
agents (median, 9.5 years; range, birth-20 years) compared with hormonal agents
(median, 2 years; range, –9.5 to 115).

CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study show that participants in cancer
clinical trials are younger than the actual Japanese cancer patient population.

ancer is a significant problem in the developed countries.
Approximately 60% of all new cases of cancer and 70% of all
cancer-related deaths occur in the elderly population, which is
defined as individuals aged 65 years.1 However, elderly patients
are often underrepresented in clinical trials of new cancer drugs.2–5
Currently, there is no age limitation for clinical trials submitted
as a New Drug Application (NDA). In Japan, the Ministry of Health
and Welfare issued a guideline that defined older people as those
aged 65 years and stated that even though age is not the only
predictive factor for disease occurring in the elderly, the age distribution of individuals participating in clinical trials should be determined based on their predicted age after study approval and that
the enrollment of patients aged 75 years must be considered. They
added that for the most part it is inappropriate to establish an arbitrary age limitation in clinical trial protocols.6 When elderly patients
are treated, one cannot neglect the following factors: the biologic

complications and comorbidity, potential drug interactions with medications for complications, and
comorbidity.8 Therefore, trials in nonelderly patients
may be insufficient for determining appropriate
treatments for the elderly. Therefore, it is necessary
to promote clinical trials for older patients.
Attempts to promote clinical trials for older
patients are necessary; however, we have little information regarding the age of the participants for
anticancer drugs approved in Japan. In the current
study, we evaluated the disparity in age between the
actual Japanese cancer patient population and patients enrolled in clinical trials submitted as a NDA.

median ages of each group. We used mean ages in
cases in which it was the only available information.
For each type of cancer, the median age of the
patient population were estimated as follows. We
obtained the age-specific incidence from Cancer
Statistics in Japan 200313 and the population by age
group from the Annual Report on Health, Labour and
Welfare 2003–2004,14 and multiplied them to estimate
the number of age-specific, newly diagnosed cancer
patients. The median age of the cancer patients was
computed based on the number of age-specific,
newly diagnosed patients. For each type of cancer,
we compared the estimated median age of the cancer patient population with the median age of participants in clinical trials submitted as NDA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source Regarding Clinical Trials
To investigate the age of patients enrolled in clinical
trials submitted as NDA that were evaluated primarily in the review process in each application, we
examined all the review reports of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) and summaries of the data submitted by applicants for the
approval of new cancer drugs and those data for a
partial change in approved cancer drugs (eg, indication and dosages). Since September 1999, all the
reports and summaries have been disclosed on the
websites of the PMDA,9 the National Institute of
Health Sciences,10 and the Japan Pharmacists Education Center.11 As of April 2005, information concerning 45 applications of anticancer agents was available.
Of these, we analyzed 43 applications containing 68
clinical trials that were approved for their antitumor
effects (Table 1). Review of a NDA is within the jurisdiction of the PMDA, which is authorized by the
Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan.12
We excluded those applications based on procedures for the approval of off-label usages with the
exception of arsenic trioxide because clinical trials
submitted as NDA were not performed for this agent.
We included the data regarding arsenic trioxide for
the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia
because the PMDA reviewed the clinical trial data,
which were submitted to the European Medicines
Agency. We also excluded phase 1 clinical trials, given
the nature of these trials.
Comparison of the Median Age Between
the Japanese Cancer Patient Population
and Participants in Clinical Trials
For the studies in which multiple treatment groups
were compared,1 we used the median age of the
entire group of enrolled patients2; when this information was unavailable, we used the mean of the

RESULTS
The age-specific incidence rates in the Japanese
cancer patient population were available for leukemia; lymphoma; and cancers of esophagus, stomach,
intestine, liver, pancreas, lung, breast, prostate, head
and neck, and uterus (Table 2). The median age of
the patient population with all cancers was 69 years
(range, 54–75 years) and 64% of these patients were
aged 65 years. Patients with cancers of the breast
and uterus were younger compared with those with
other cancers (median age of 57 years vs a median
age of 54 years).
The median ages of both the patient population
and the clinical trial participants were available for
68 clinical trials of 26 applications. The median age
of the clinical trial participants ranged from 33 years
to 73 years, and was older than 65 years in 13 trials
(19%). Thirty of the 57 evaluable trials had agerelated inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 3).
The median difference in age between the clinical trial participants and the cancer patient population was 7 years in 68 trials (range, –16 to 133 years)
(Table 4). The median age of the clinical trial participants was lower than that of the patient population
in 60 of the 68 clinical trials, whereas the clinical trial
participants were older than the cancer patient
population in 5 trials. These included 3 trials of anastrozole for breast cancer, 1 trial of paclitaxel for
endometrial cancer, and 1 trial of etoposide for cervical cancer. As shown in Table 4, the age differences
were minimal in the clinical trials of breast and
uterine cancer, whereas they were large in clinical
trials of leukemia. The median age of clinical trial
participants was 33 years younger than that of the
cancer patient population in the clinical trial of
arsenic trioxide for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

* For 8 trials, a summary of clinical data by the applicant were unavailable to the public.
For 3 trials, detailed eligibility criteria in summary of the clinical data were unavailable.

The current study included applications of 4
molecular-targeting agents (17 trials) and 3 hormonal
agents (10 trials), which are expected to have low
toxicities. Nine of the 27 trials regarding hormonal
and molecular-targeting agents had age restrictions
in their eligibility criteria, whereas 21 of the 30 evaluable trials regarding cytotoxic agents had age-related
eligibility criteria (P ¼ .0081). Differences in the
median age between the cancer patient population
and the clinical trial participants for molecular-targeting and hormonal agents are shown in Figure 1.
With the exception of a clinical trial of anastrozole,
clinical trial participants were younger than the cancer patient population. The median age difference
between the cancer patient population and the clinical trial participants was 6 years (range, –9.5 to 120
years). The age difference was found to be larger in
trials of molecular-targeting agents (median, 9.5 years
[range, birth-20 years]) compared with hormonal
agents (median, 2 years [range, –9.5 to 115 years]).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrated that
the median age of participants in clinical trials is
younger than that of actual cancer patients in the
majority of clinical trials submitted as NDAs in
Japan. The differences in the median age between
the participants in cancer clinical trials and the
cancer patient population were all >20 years in 6
trials, all of which examined the treatment of acute
leukemia. The low rates of enrollment of older

cancer patients have been attributed to physicians’
judgment that the risk of toxicity is high in elderly
patients due to their reduced physical function and
comorbidity, and to the difficulty of older patients
in meeting the eligibility criteria.4,15 Moreover, the
higher number of participants and the higher cost
are necessary due to high numbers of dropouts and
adverse events if elderly patients are enrolled more
frequently. Considering that, at the current time, the
median age of Japanese cancer patients is 69 years,
and that as many as 64.4% of these patients are aged
65 years, we should be careful in interpreting the
results of the clinical trials submitted as NDAs.
Cancer treatment has recently shifted from toxic
drugs to less toxic treatment, including moleculartargeting agents and hormonal agents; however, to
our knowledge, there are few data available regarding
the clinical trial participants for these agents. The
current study included 10 trials of hormonal agents
(eg, leuprorelin and goserelin for prostate cancer and
anastrozole for breast cancer). The disparity in the
median age between Japanese cancer patients and
the trial participants was small with regard to hormonal treatment (median, 2 years [range, –9.5–15
years]) (Fig. 1). Because the major adverse effects of
hormonal agents are usually mild,16,17 appropriate
representatives of the patient population may be
enrolled in clinical trials of these agents.
However, this is in contrast to the clinical trials
of molecular-targeting agents, which the majority of

clinicians believe are more specific and less toxic
than conventional cytotoxic agents. With regard to
these drugs, the median difference in age between
the trial participants and the cancer patient population was 9.5 years (range, birth to 20 years). These
disparities are observed in the U.S. as well as in
Japan. For example, the median age of patients who
were enrolled in pivotal trials of rituximab submitted
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)18–20
ranged from 55 years to 59 years, whereas the
median age of patients with malignant lymphoma
was 66 years.21 The mean age of patients who were

enrolled in the pivotal trial of trastuzumab for breast
cancer submitted to the FDA was 53 years,22 whereas
the median age of patients with breast cancer was 61
years. However, previous studies have demonstrated
that molecular-targeting agents have substantial
toxicities.23–25 These toxicities were underestimated
due to the age disparities. Further clinical trials are
required to evaluate the safety of these agents for
elderly patients.
Several hypotheses can be put forward for these
disparities. First, because the target antigens of
molecular-targeting agents are frequently expressed
in normal tissues, clinicians might have a concern
that these drugs may damage the healthy tissue.
Several reports have been published regarding the
adverse events of molecular-targeting agents, including the cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab,23 pulmonary
fibrosis resulting from gefitinib,24 and multiorgan failure occurring after the administration of TGN1412.25
Second, eligibility criteria for molecular-targeting
agents might be more strict than those for hormonal
agents; however, there was no significant difference
noted with regard to age restrictions between clinical
trials of molecular-targeting agents and those of
hormonal agents. It is unlikely that the age disparities between the clinical trial participants and the
cancer patient population in clinical trials of molecular-targeting agents were attributable to their eligibility criteria. Finally, we have little experience regarding
the clinical use of molecular-targeting agents, and to
our knowledge little information is available concerning their safety. These situations are in contrast to
hormonal agents, which have been utilized in many
clinical settings other than cancer chemotherapy.
Many physicians may be concerned about unex-

pected toxicities and therefore might avoid the
enrollment of elderly patients into clinical trials of
molecular-targeting agents.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
found that participants in clinical trials of anticancer
drugs are younger than the actual Japanese cancer
population. Approved drugs may possibly be administered to older patients who have not been evaluated in clinical trials submitted as NDA. The
development of a methodology of clinical trials to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticancer drugs
specifically in older patients is awaited.
