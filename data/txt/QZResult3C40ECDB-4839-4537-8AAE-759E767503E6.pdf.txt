Abstract
Previous studies have shown biological activity of thymoquinone, an active compound extracted from Nigella sativa, in
pancreatic cancer cells; however, preclinical animal studies
are lacking. Here, we report, for the first time, the chemosensitizing effect of thymoquinone to conventional chemotherapeutic agents both in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic
model of pancreatic cancer. In vitro studies revealed that
preexposure of cells with thymoquinone (25 Mmol/L) for
48 h followed by gemcitabine or oxaliplatin resulted in 60%
to 80% growth inhibition compared with 15% to 25% when
gemcitabine or oxaliplatin was used alone. Moreover, we
found that thymoquinone could potentiate the killing of pancreatic cancer cells induced by chemotherapeutic agents by
down-regulation of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), Bcl-2 family,
and NF-KB-dependent antiapoptotic genes (X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis, survivin, and cyclooxygenase-2). As shown
previously by our laboratory, NF-KB gets activated on exposure of pancreatic cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents; interestingly, thymoquinone was able to
down-regulate NF-KB in vitro, resulting in chemosensitization.
In addition to in vitro results, here we show for the first time,
that thymoquinone in combination with gemcitabine and/or
oxaliplatin is much more effective as an antitumor agent
compared with either agent alone. Most importantly, our
data also showed that a specific target, such as NF-KB, was
inactivated in animal tumors pretreated with thymoquinone
followed by gemcitabine and/or oxaliplatin. These results
provide strong in vivo molecular evidence in support of our
hypothesis that thymoquinone could abrogate gemcitabineor oxaliplatin-induced activation of NF-KB, resulting in the
chemosensitization of pancreatic tumors to conventional
therapeutics. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5575–83]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth major cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of <3%. According to
NIH-National Cancer Institute statistics, of the 38,000 new cases of
pancreatic cancer diagnosed in 2008, 35,000 are expected to
succumb to this disease. Despite the availability of myriad of
treatment modalities, including preferred cytotoxic chemotherapy,
dose-limiting toxicity to normal tissues and acquisition of acquired

resistance fails to transcend into optimal clinical benefit in terms
of cure rate in an overwhelming majority of patients (1). Emerging
evidence suggest DNA-binding ability of the transcription factor
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) as a major mechanism contributing to
chemoresistant phenotype of pancreatic cancer (2–4) and that
several conventional cancer chemotherapeutic agents activate NFnB leading to unfavorable clinical outcome (4–8). In recent years,
naturally occurring compounds are being investigated because
of their alleged therapeutic effects attributable to inactivation of
NF-nB and other survival signaling cascade within tumors and
fewer associated toxicities (5, 9, 10). Here, we report, for the first
time, the therapeutic benefit and mechanism of action of a naturally occurring compound thymoquinone in sensitizing pancreatic
cancer cells to conventional cytotoxic drugs.
Thymoquinone is the bioactive compound derived from black seed
(Nigella sativa) oil. In folklore medicine, the seed is reportedly
associated with diverse therapeutic benefits as related to bronchial
asthma, dysentery, headache, gastrointestinal problems, eczema,
hypertension, and obesity. We recently reported in a comprehensive
review the therapeutic and chemopreventive potential of black
cumin seeds (11). In the context of cancer, thymoquinone has been
reported to exhibit antiproliferative effects on cell lines derived from
breast, colon, ovarian, larynx, lung, myeloblastic leukemia, and
osteosarcoma (12–18). Additionally, thymoquinone inhibited hormone-refractory prostate cancer by targeting androgen receptor and
transcription factor E2F (19). Mechanistically, thymoquinone reportedly induced apoptosis in tumor cells by suppressing NF-nB, Akt
activation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways and also inhibits tumor angiogenesis (20, 21). These limited
studies suggest that thymoquinone could be useful as an adjunct to
conventional chemotherapeutics; however, in vivo studies in support
of this statement are lacking and our current findings filled that gap.
Gemcitabine is the first-line conventional chemotherapy for
pancreatic cancer, but oxaliplatin is used as an alternative option
(22, 23). Conventional dosing with either cytotoxic drug given at
maximum tolerated dose caused side effects and fails to respond
adequately due to acquisition of chemoresistance phenomenon
(23, 24). In the present study, first we sought to understand the
molecular mechanism of action of thymoquinone in pancreatic
cancer cells in inducing apoptosis and then examined the chemosensitization potential of thymoquinone in combination with
oxaliplatin and gemcitabine to reduce viable cells and potentiate
apoptosis using low concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs.
Importantly, we also tested our hypothesis in vivo using an orthotropic model of pancreatic cancer in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) animals. Using in vivo imaging data, we show, for
the first time, that thymoquinone pretreatment in combination
with either gemcitabine or oxaliplatin caused greater antitumor
activity than each drug given alone. These results correlated with

down-regulation of NF-nB activity and its downstream proteins
such as survivin, Bcl-xL, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)
in tumor extracts.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and HPAC
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human
pancreatic ductal epithelial cells and COLO-357 were obtained from M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center. The cell lines were maintained in continuous
exponential growth in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 10 mg/mL streptomycin in
a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air at 37jC.
Antibodies were obtained from the following commercial sources:
caspase-3, caspase-9, cytochrome c, cytochrome c oxidase, and p65 (Cell
Signaling); anti-mouse Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Mcl-1, and anti-retinoblastoma
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) antibody (Biomol Research); and anti-h-actin (Sigma). Thymoquinone (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO to make 20 mmol/L stock solution.
Oxaliplatin and gemcitabine were obtained from the Barbara Ann
Karmanos Cancer Institute pharmacy.
Cell viability inhibition by thymoquinone. Cells (3  103 per well) in
96-well culture plates were seeded and replaced next day with fresh medium
containing thymoquinone (0-50 Amol/L) diluted from stock solution. After
72 h, MTT solution was added and incubated further for 2 h. MTT formazan
formed by metabolically viable cells was dissolved in isopropanol, and
absorbance was measured at 595 nm on a plate reader (TECAN).
Cell viability inhibition by cytotoxic agents. Cells were plated and
incubated with medium containing thymoquinone (25 Amol/L) for 48 h and
exposed to 500 nmol/L gemcitabine or 62 Amol/L oxaliplatin for an
additional 24 h. The effect of thymoquinone pretreatment on cell viability
was examined by MTT as described above. To investigate the synergistic
effect between thymoquinone, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin, cells were
exposed to drugs in fixed ratio as above and combination index (CI) was
calculated using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).
Quantification of apoptosis. The Cell Apoptosis ELISA Detection Kit
(Roche) was used to detect apoptosis in pancreatic cancer according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. HPAC cells were plated
and allowed to attach for 36 h. Thymoquinone was directly added to cell
cultures at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 72 h. Total
protein (40 Ag) was separated on SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and probed
with specific antibodies.
Analysis of cytochrome c release. Mitochondria and cytosolic fractions
were obtained as described previously (6) to detect cytochrome c release by
Western immunoblotting.
Caspase activity assays. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities were
measured in HPAC cells and tissue lysates by a colorimetric assay according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems).
Determination of prostaglandin E2. HPAC cells were seeded in 50 mm
dishes and treated with thymoquinone (0-50 Amol/L) for 72 h in serum-free
medium. Conditioned medium was collected and analyzed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using PGE2 high-sensitivity immunoassay kit (R&D Systems).
Cell cycle analysis. HPAC cells were treated with thymoquinone for
48 h followed by either gemcitabine (500 nmol/L) or oxaliplatin (62 Amol/L)
for 24 h. The fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide for 30 min and
analyzed by flow cytometry.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared
from treated samples and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was done by
incubating 10 Ag nuclear extract with IRDye-700-labeled NF-nB oligonucleotide as described earlier (6).
Experimental animals and orthotopic implantation of tumor cells.
Female ICR/SCID mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. HPAC cells
were harvested from subconfluent cultures, washed in serum-free medium,
and resuspended in PBS. Cells (1  106) in 15 AL PBS were injected into the
parenchyma of pancreas with a 27-gauge hypodermic needle.

Experimental protocol. Mice were randomized into the following treatment groups (n = 7): (a) untreated control; (b) thymoquinone 3 mg/mouse
given daily by intragastric intubation for 25 days; (c) oxaliplatin 5 mg/kg
body weight, intraperitoneally, given twice per week; (d) gemcitabine
50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally, given thrice per week; and (e) and
( f ) thymoquinone and gemcitabine or oxaliplatin following schedule as for
individual treatments. All mice were sacrificed on day 35 following last dose
of thymoquinone, and their body weight was recorded. On autopsy, the
pancreas was excised neatly and weighed. One part of the tissue was fixed in
formalin and another part was frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Mice imaging. EGF-IRDye-800CW (epidermal growth factor receptor
antibody) was delivered via tail vein (1 nmol/L per mice) 96 h before euthanizing the animals. Near IR fluorescence imaging of live animals was
done using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.
Tumor tissue nuclear protein extraction and electrophoretic
mobility shift assay. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from tumor
tissues and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was done by incubating
12 Ag nuclear extract with IRDye-700-labeled NF-nB oligonucleotide as
described earlier (5).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry. H&E and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) for apoptosis were done on paraffinembedded tissue sections.
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as mean F SD for the absolute
values or percent of controls as indicated in the vertical axis legend of
Figs. 1 to 6. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test.
P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Effect of thymoquinone on cell viability and apoptosis
induction. In Fig. 1A, thymoquinone inhibited cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner. In almost all pancreatic cancer cell lines,
cell viability was reduced up to 70% with 50 Amol/L thymoquinone
treatment for 72 h. In contrast, treatment of human pancreatic
ductal epithelial cells resulted in minimal loss of viable cell when
exposed to identical concentrations of thymoquinone for a similar
period. BxPC-3 cells harboring wild-type K-ras oncogene and
mutated p53 was sensitive to the effect of thymoquinone in as
much as pancreatic cancer cells with mutant k-ras and wild-type
p53 (HPAC and COLO-357). Further, to assess whether the loss of
cell viability could in part be due to apoptosis, we evaluated
apoptosis using histone-DNA ELISA. Figure 1B shows a significant
increase in apoptotic cells, which closely parallels the loss of viable
cells following thymoquinone treatment. In contrast, human
pancreatic ductal epithelial cells were minimally affected to
apoptosis by equivalent concentrations of thymoquinone.
Thymoquinone inhibits antiapoptotic molecules in HPAC
cells. To understand the molecular basis of thymoquinone-induced
apoptosis, we performed Western immunoblotting using HPAC
cells as representative. As shown in Fig. 2A, the proapoptotic
protein Bax was markedly induced, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were
significantly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner,
indicating that the apoptotic effects of thymoquinone are partly
caused by up-regulating the Bax/Bcl-2 or Bax/Bcl-xL protein ratio,
which is a critical determinant of apoptosis. Additionally, we
assessed other antiapoptotic molecules Mcl-1, survivin, and XIAP.
Relative to control, Mcl-1, survivin, and XIAP expression was downregulated in cells exposed to thymoquinone. These results provide
additional molecular evidence of apoptosis induction by thymoquinone treatment.
Western immunoblotting also revealed thymoquinone treatment
resulted in appearance of cleaved active component of caspase-3,
caspase-9, and PARP in HPAC cells (Fig. 2A). In parallel, caspase-3

and caspase-9 activities were also significantly elevated (Fig. 2B).
An upstream event in activation of the caspase cascade is the
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Thymoquinone induced release of cytochrome c in dose-responsive manner (Fig. 2A),
suggesting that thymoquinone-induced apoptosis in HPAC cells is
mediated at least in part by the mitochondrial pathway.
Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 expression and PGE2 accumulation by thymoquinone. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
enzyme is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and is involved in
the inhibition of apoptosis, potentiation of cell growth, and angiogenesis and thus considered as a putative target for drug development (25). To determine whether thymoquinone reduces the
expression of COX-2 and consequently the production of PGE2,
COX-2-expressing HPAC cells were treated with thymoquinone.
Western immunoblotting showed a significant decrease in COX-2
protein expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Further,
to confirm whether the catalytic activity of COX-2 and thus the
production of PGE2 were inhibited by thymoquinone or not, culture
supernatant was collected from exponentially growing HPAC cells
in the presence of thymoquinone, and the PGE2 levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 2C, the synthesis of PGE2 was significantly
decreased in a dose-dependent manner after thymoquinone
treatment, which well correlated with the down-regulation of
COX-2 expression. These results are consistent with the ability of
thymoquinone in inhibiting cell growth and induction of apoptosis.

Thymoquinone inhibits activation of NF-KB. To investigate
whether thymoquinone could abrogate constitutively active NF-nB
in pancreatic cancer cells, cells were treated with increasing doses
of thymoquinone (0-40 Amol/L) for 48 h and subjected to gel shift
assay (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Thymoquinone resulted
in a concentration-dependent decrease in NF-nB DNA-binding
activity in HPAC and BxPC-3 cells (Fig. 2D), which was further
confirmed by supershift experiment. These results are consistent
with down-regulation of COX-2, survivin, and Bcl family proteins
because these proteins are transcriptionally regulated by NF-nB
and contribute to the survival of cells by inhibiting apoptosis.
Thymoquinone sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The effect of gemcitabine or oxaliplatin on
the viability of pancreatic cancer cells was determined by MTT
assay (data not shown). Subsequent studies were undertaken to
examine whether cells pretreated with thymoquinone could be
more sensitive to gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Cells were either
treated with thymoquinone (25 Amol/L alone for 48 h) followed by
24 h incubation with suboptimal dose of either drugs, gemcitabine
and oxaliplatin, and cell viability was determined (Fig. 3A). We
noticed treatment of cells with either thymoquinone for 48 h or
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin alone for 24 h caused 15% to 50% loss
of viable pancreatic cancer cells depending on cell type. However,
pretreatment with thymoquinone followed by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in 65% to 80% (P < 0.001) loss of viable
cells in all pancreatic cancer cell evaluated, which we believe may
be associated with less toxic side effects on normal cells.
Interestingly, pretreatment with thymoquinone proved more
efficacious in sensitizing the cells to cytotoxic agents compared
with cotreatment or washing away thymoquinone before adding
drugs (data not shown). Further, to confirm synergism, we determined CI values for two combination treatment groups. CI is a
quantitative measure of the degree of drug interaction; CI < 1
indicates synergism, CI > 1 indicates antagonism, and CI = 1
indicates additive effect. Our results show that cells pretreated with
thymoquinone showed synergistic loss of the cell viability when
combined with gemcitabine or oxaliplatin (CI = 0.735 and 0.784 for
thymoquinone and gemcitabine and 0.545 and 0.685 for thymoquinone and oxaliplatin).
Thymoquinone sensitizes HPAC cells to apoptosis by
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. We next confirmed whether
enhanced cytotoxicity by thymoquinone pretreatment was mediated by apoptosis. Accordingly, relative to single agent, thymoquinone pretreatment (25 Amol/L) followed by either gemcitabine or
oxaliplatin elicited significantly (V30-50%; P < 0.01) higher apoptosis in all investigated pancreatic cancer cell lines, suggesting that
the loss of viable cells by thymoquinone and gemcitabine/or oxaliplatin results due to the induction of cell death pathway (Fig. 3D).
Thymoquinone pretreatment enhances apoptosis by oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in HPAC cells. To understand sensitization mechanism and apoptosis by thymoquinone pretreatment,
we assessed by Western immunoblotting the status on caspase-3,
caspase-9, and PARP cleavage and modulation of other prosurvival molecules (Fig. 4A). Cells were exposed to thymoquinone
(25 Amol/L) for 48 h before addition of gemcitabine or oxaliplatin
for 24 h. Our data showed that whereas treatment of HPAC cells
with single agents showed appearance of cleaved caspase-3, 9, and
PARP, thymoquinone pretreatment significantly augmented and
showed comparatively strong band for cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9,
and PARP (Fig. 4A). Additionally, caspase-3 activity was also
observed significantly elevated in the combination treatment group

(Fig. 4C). Based on our results showing apoptosis, we evaluated
other prosurvival molecules such as Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP.
Our results showed significant down-regulation of these proteins
consistent with results obtained for PARP and caspases, indicating
that thymoquinone indeed synergize the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (Fig. 4A).
Thymoquinone down-regulates NF-KB activation stimulated
by gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. HPAC cells were exposed to
25 Amol/L thymoquinone for 48 h followed by 3 h of either
gemcitabine (500 nmol/L) or oxaliplatin (62 Amol/L), and their
nuclear extracts were subjected to NF-nB DNA-binding activity assay
by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Consistent with previously
published data (5, 6), we found that gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
treatment alone for 3 h induced NF-nB DNA-binding activity
(Fig. 4B). Interestingly, pretreatment with 25 Amol/L thymoquinone
abrogated gemcitabine- or oxaliplatin-induced activation of NF-nB
(Fig. 4C). These results show that thymoquinone not only downregulates preexisting basal levels of NF-nB DNA-binding activity
in unstimulated pancreatic cancer cells but also could inhibit gemcitabine- or oxaliplatin-induced NF-nB activation, and we strongly
believe the chemosensitizing effect of thymoquinone is in part due
to inactivation of NF-nB and its downstream genes.
Effect of thymoquinone exposure on cell cycle distribution. Untreated HPAC cells showed a relatively normal pattern,
with most cells in the S phase (49.37%), a lower G0-G1 phase
(32.96%), and G2-M (17.66%) peak of the cell cycle. The change
in the cell cycle distribution of HPAC cells treated for 48 h with
25 Amol/L thymoquinone followed by 24 h treatment with either

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

gemcitabine (500 nmol/L) or oxaliplatin (62 Amol/L) is shown in
Fig. 4D. Gemcitabine (500 nmol/L) alone caused G0-G1 cell cycle
arrest (46.40% versus 32.96% in control), whereas oxaliplatin (62
Amol/L) alone resulted in S-phase arrest (62.96% versus 32.96%
in control) after 24 h treatment. Interestingly, thymoquinone
pretreatment led to increased cell population at the G0-G1 phase
from 46.40% to 56.61% in thymoquinone-gemcitabine group.
Thymoquinone-oxaliplatin augmented S-phase arrest from
62.96% to 73.28% in pancreatic cancer cells, whereas the
proportion of G2-M-phase cells decreased. This indicates that
thymoquinone pretreatment potentates arrest of cells in
progression of the cell cycle.
Thymoquinone enhances in vivo therapeutic effect of
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin on HPAC orthotopic tumor.
Building on aforementioned results, which strongly support better
killing of pancreatic cancer cells when preexposed to thymoquinone, we evaluated therapeutic advantage of thymoquinone and
gemcitabine or oxaliplatin in SCID mice bearing orthotopically
implanted HPAC cells. Such studies have never been documented
in vivo to the best of our knowledge. A dose of 3.0 mg/d
thymoquinone/mouse was selected for intragastric administration,
whereas gemcitabine (50 mg/kg body weight) and oxaliplatin
(5 mg/kg body weight) dosages were based on previously published
reports and administered as depicted in Fig. 5A. The efficacy of
treatment was determined by considering mean pancreatic tumor
weight immediately following euthanization. Administration of
thymoquinone caused 38% reduction in tumor weight. Gemcitabine or oxaliplatin alone caused 66% and 58% reduction in tumor

weight, respectively (Fig. 5B). However, the combination of
thymoquinone-gemcitabine or thymoquinone-oxaliplatin showed
significant decrease (P < 0.01) in tumor weight relative to untreated
control, thymoquinone alone, gemcitabine alone, or only oxaliplatin. Thymoquinone also suppressed local invasion and nodal
metastasis. On autopsy, 86% of mice from the control group
showed evidence of nodal metastasis. In contrast, a progressive
decline in the percentage of mice harboring nodal metastasis, as
well as metastatic tumor size, was noticed in the combination
groups as shown in Fig. 5C. Other than nodal metastasis, no
macroscopic evidence of spreading to other visceral organs was
evident in any experimental groups.

Because pancreatic cancer cells, especially HPAC cells, overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor, we validated our findings
using a noninvasive IR fluorescent-labeled probe for evaluating
tumor size in vivo using Li-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging
Detection System (26). Scanning pancreatic tumor images of mice
randomly selected from each group revealed significantly reduced
fluorescence intensity (P < 0.01) in the combination group
suggestive of a superior effect relative to monotherapy, consistent
with inhibition of tumor weights assessed at autopsy. Our treatment conditions did not cause any severe toxicity as assessed by
the weight loss criteria or aversion to food intake or diarrhea, suggesting that thymoquinone did not induce any deleterious effects.

These results, for the first time, confirm the chemosensitization

NF-KB DNA-binding activity and antiapoptotic protein
expression in vivo. Our results clearly show that NF-nB in tumor
samples was moderately down-regulated by thymoquinone alone,
but unlike in vitro situation, neither gemcitabine- nor oxaliplatintreated animals revealed any overtly induction of NF-nB DNAbinding activity relative to control specimens. However, similar to our
in vitro studies, constitutively active NF-nB was abrogated in tumors
samples from mice treated with thymoquinone in combination with
either gemcitabine or oxaliplatin (Fig. 6B). These results are in part
similar to our in vitro findings and complement our hypothesis that
the inactivation of NF-nB is, at least, one of the molecular
mechanisms by which thymoquinone potentiates gemcitabine- or
oxaliplatin-induced antitumor activity in vivo. Tumors also revealed
down-regulation of a few important NF-nB-regulated molecules such
as Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP proteins and also caspase-3 activity,
providing evidence of apoptosis within tumors (Fig. 6B and C).
Tumor histology and immunohistochemistry. H&E evaluation of the tumors from all groups showed high-grade carcinoma

associated with tumor apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 6D, left column).
In the control and thymoquinone group, the tumor was largely
viable with high mitosis and minimal intratumoral stroma. In
contrast, in the group receiving combined treatment, large areas of
cell debris due to marked tumor destruction in the tissue sections
were seen. The peripheral tumor is composed of smaller nests or
clusters of neoplastic cells. Similar but milder changes were also seen
in the tumors from the group treated with gemcitabine or oxaliplatin
alone. Immunohistochemistry revealed significant reduction in

thymoquinone and gemcitabine (P < 0.05) or thymoquinone and

Significant differences in percentage of TUNEL-positive cells were
also noted in tumors derived from the combination group relative to
single-agent-treated animals (P < 0.05).

cells. Unfortunately, in pancreatic tumors, acquisition of drug
resistance during chemotherapy constitutes a major impediment
and challenge in curing patients. In clinical setting, suboptimal
therapeutic benefit was achieved when prognostic combinations of
different classes of chemotherapeutic agents were attempted owing
to dose-limiting toxicities (27). Extensive studies from our laboratory
and elsewhere acknowledge the underlying resistance to therapeutic

response and aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer is partly due to
constitutive activation of the transcription factor, NF-nB (5, 28, 29).
We therefore conceptualized that both de novo and acquired
resistance to therapy could be attenuated using combination therapy
based on sound rationale and hypothesized that thymoquinone
might be an novel chemosensitizing agent, which mechanistically at
molecular level could be due to inactivation of the DNA-binding
activity of NF-nB resulting in inactivation of multiple downstream
survival factors. Additionally, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins predominantly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells also reportedly
contribute to pancreatic cancer chemoresistance, which can be suppressed by NF-nB inhibition (30). Emerging evidence also indicates
that overexpression of XIAP and survivin, members of IAP proteins
in human pancreatic cancer, is associated with poor prognosis and
increased tumor recurrence (31, 32). Survivin has been validated as a
therapeutic target because of its dual function in inhibiting
apoptosis as well as its role in regulation of mitosis in concert with
different cell cycle regulators (33, 34). Small interfering RNA directed
against survivin leading to enhanced pancreatic cancer chemosensitivity to gemcitabine has been reported (35). Additionally, expression of these proteins has also been shown to be associated with
resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis in carcinomas of the
lung, breast, ovary, and esophagus (36–39).
To understand how thymoquinone inhibits cell viability and
induce apoptosis, we noticed that thymoquinone per se was effective as a general inducer of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer by
down-regulating several antiapoptotic proteins using a dose that
had no effect on normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells.
Corollary to our hypothesis, we present evidence documenting
significant reduction of tumors in vivo by combination of thymoquinone and gemcitabine or oxaliplatin that were found
associated with the inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL. Thymoquinone per se was effective in down-regulating IAP proteins, XIAP
and survivin, not only in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro but also in
preclinical in vivo conditions along with gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin. Furthermore, our observations with cell cycle progression revealed that preexposure to thymoquinone augmented
gemcitabine-induced G0-G1-phase cell cycle arrest, whereas thymoquinone and oxaliplatin resulted in increased S-phase cell cycle
arrest. It is conceivable that thymoquinone prevented the progression of cell cycle through the M phase resulting from inhibition
of survivin, leading them to undergo apoptosis.
COX-2 and its synthesized product, PGE2, is also overexpressed
in pancreatic cancer and therefore considered as promising
chemotherapeutic target for treatment and reversal of chemoresistance phenotype (25, 40–42). The effect of thymoquinone on
COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in a mouse model of
allergic airway inflammation has been reported (43). In line with
this, significant down-regulation of COX-2 protein expression and
the level of PGE2 were observed in HPAC cells treated with
thymoquinone. Because the promoter sequence of COX-2 contain
binding sites for NF-nB, it is conceivable that thymoquinone
complemented down-regulation of COX-2 by inhibition of NF-nB.
These observations highlight therapeutic benefit of thymoquinone
as natural inhibitor of COX-2 and PGE2, which open avenues for
inclusion of thymoquinone as natural adjuvant in pancreatic
cancer treatment.
Interestingly, our in vitro results were recapitulated in vivo in an
orthotopic pancreatic cancer model, wherein thymoquinone
significantly augmented antitumor efficacy of chemotherapeutics.
Although none of the mice from combination treatment group were

found tumor-free, the therapeutic effect was significant compared
with single-drug treatment. These findings draw a parallel with
increased TUNEL staining and reduced Ki-67 immunoreactivity
indicative of apoptosis and reduced cellular proliferation within
tumors. These features are of significant value in predicting
improved therapeutic outcome and warrant further studies.
In conclusion, we have presented evidence showing that cells
with de novo and acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic
drugs (such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) could be reversed
by thymoquinone pretreatment. Thymoquinone down-regulated
antiapoptotic and prosurvival proteins that are transcriptionally
regulated by NF-nB, resulting in loss of pancreatic cancer cells
to survive and proliferate. Our in vitro findings along with
in vivo results provide confidence in support of further

development of thymoquinone as an adjunct to conventional
chemotherapeutics by targeted inactivation of NF-nB for
treatment of human pancreatic tumors in the future and
initiation of clinical trial.
