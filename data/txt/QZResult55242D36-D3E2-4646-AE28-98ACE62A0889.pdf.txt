BACKGROUND: A subset of patients who present with metastatic solid tumors never receive anticancer therapy. Reasons may
include poor functional status, comorbidities, and patient preference. To the authors’ knowledge, the prevalence and characteristics
of this population have not previously been described. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients diagnosed
with metastatic (stage IV according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer) solid tumors (including those of the breast, cervix,
colon, and kidney; small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer [NSCLC]; and tumors of the prostate, rectum, and uterus) who received
neither radiotherapy nor systemic therapy. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for the percentage of untreated to treated patients with stage IV cancer. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2008, 773,233 patients with stage IV
cancer were identified, 159,284 of whom (20.6%; 95% confidence interval, 20.5%-20.7%) received no anticancer therapy. Patients with
NSCLC accounted for 55% of the untreated population. Patients with cancers of the kidney and lung had the highest rates of no
treatment at 25.5% and 24.0%, respectively, whereas patients with prostate cancer had the lowest rate of no treatment at 11.1%.
Across all cancer types, older age (PR range, 1.37-1.49; all P < .001), black race (PR range, 1.05-1.32; all P < .001), lack of medical insurance (PR range, 1.47-2.46; all P < .001), and lower income (except for cancer of the uterus; PR range, 0.91-0.98 for every $10,000increase in income [all P < .001]) were associated with a lack of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 20% of patients who present with stage IV solid tumors do not receive anticancer therapy. Although there are likely multiple reasons for this lack of treatment,
including appropriate indications, these findings have potential implications with regard to health care policy and access to care.

INTRODUCTION
Clinicians caring for patients with cancer are well aware that a subset of patients who present with metastatic solid
tumors never receive anticancer therapy. Although advanced solid tumors are generally not curable with current therapeutic modalities, the use of systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been associated with improvements in
cancer-related symptoms, and prolongation of life, across multiple tumor types.1,2 Despite these benefits, treatment
may be forgone for several reasons including comorbidities, poor functional status, lack of access to care, and personal preference.3,4
To the best of our knowledge, there has been scant literature describing the prevalence and characteristics of patients
presenting with advanced cancer who receive no anticancer therapy. In 1 such study of 6308 patients diagnosed with stage
IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 1991 and 1993, only 21.5% of patients received systemic therapy.5 However, since the early 1990s, additional data have been generated to support the use of chemotherapy for advanced cancer
and more tolerable treatment regimens have been developed.6 A recent analysis of patients with urothelial cancer reported
that 23.8% of patients with metastatic disease received no systemic therapy.7 Studies of large populations of patients with
cancer, across various tumor types, have to our knowledge not been performed previously to estimate the magnitude of
potential undertreatment. Therefore, we sought to analyze the treatment patterns of patients presenting with metastatic
cancer across 9 common cancer types using a contemporary cohort from a national cancer registry database.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

Data for this study were obtained from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) Public Benchmark Reports (http://
cromwell.facs.org/BMarks/BMPub/Ver10/bm_reports.
cfm) from 2000 through 2008. The NCDB is a national,
hospital-based cancer registry jointly sponsored by the
American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer
Society. Since 1996, the Commission on Cancer (CoC)
has required CoC-accredited programs to report cancers
diagnosed or treated at their facilities to the NCDB. As of
2001, data collection has been restricted only to
CoC-accredited programs, including > 1400 academic
centers, cancer centers, community hospitals, and Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. The NCDB contains standardized data elements regarding patient demographics,
tumor characteristics, and the first course of treatment. In
addition, the NCDB contains information concerning
patient insurance status, geographic location of residence,
type of treatment facility, and income level. The NCDB
Public Benchmark Reports provide access to aggregatelevel data categorized by multiple variables.8 Previous
studies have shown concordance between the NCDB data
set and other national population and cancer registries for
ethnicity distribution, age distribution, insurance status,
and stage at diagnosis.9 Because no patient, provider, or
hospital identifiers are included in the research data set
and no protected health information is present, Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this
study.
Patient Population

Study participants were diagnosed with American Joint
Committee on Cancer stage IV lung (NSCLC or small
cell lung cancer [SCLC]), breast, kidney, prostate, colon,
rectum, cervical, or uterine cancer and did not receive any
first-course therapy. These cancers represent 5 of the most
common solid tumors diagnosed in men and women in
the United States.10 The label ‘‘no first-course therapy’’
was selected to designate patients who refused any type of
intervention, who died before the initiation of treatment,
or for whom the treating physician recommended no
treatment be given. Importantly, the ‘‘no first-course therapy’’ designation is actively selected by the cancer registrar
and excludes patients with other or unknown first-course
therapies.
Patient Demographics and Socioeconomic
Indicators

Factors potentially associated with a lack of treatment
were classified into 4 categories: clinical characteristics,
5948

patient-level demographics, area socioeconomic indicators, and facility characteristics. Data regarding stage of
disease, year of diagnosis, and first-course therapy were
extracted. Age at diagnosis was classified as a categorical
variable using the following age groups: aged < 20 years
to 49 years, aged 50 years to 59 years, aged 60 years to 69
years, aged 70 years to 79 years, aged 80 years to 89 years,
and aged > 90 years. Race was defined by Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards (FORDS) criteria and categorized as white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), and
other/unknown. In terms of ethnicity, patients were classified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic. Primary payer/insurance type at the time of diagnosis was also defined by
FORDS criteria and was grouped into the following categories: private insurance plans (health maintenance organization, preferred provider organization, managed care,
or private insurance), Medicaid, Medicare (Medicare
alone or Medicare with supplement), uninsured (not
insured, insurance not otherwise specified, charity writeoff, and self-pay), and military (VA or military/
TRICARE).
Area-based indicators of patient socioeconomic
status, specifically education and income, were derived
by the NCDB from US census data at the ZIP code
level, and divided into 5 equally proportional categories based on the observed distribution. The percentages of the population in the patient’s ZIP code of
residence without a high school degree were coded
into the following groups: > 29%, 20% to 28.9%,
14% to 19.9%, and < 14%. The median household
income for the patients’ ZIP code of residence was
stratified into the following groups: < $28,000,
$28,000 to $32,999, $33,000 to $38,999, $39,000 to
$48,999, and > $49,000.
Statistical Analyses

The primary objective of the current study was to
define the percentage of patients with stage IV cancer
who received no anticancer therapy. An additional
objective was to examine patient characteristics associated with a lack of treatment. Log-binomial regression
analysis was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs)
and corresponding 95% confidence limits (95% CL)
relating the percentages of patients receiving no firstcourse therapy versus any therapy for stage IV cancer
among categories of various socioeconomic and demographic variables. Statistical significance was defined as
P < .05. All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS statistical software (Version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Study Population

Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 5,395,382 patients with
breast, cervical, colon, and kidney cancer; NSCLC; SCLC;
and prostate, rectal, and uterine cancer were identified in
the NCDB. A total of 4,173,128 patients with stage 0 to
III disease or an unknown disease stage were excluded (Fig.
1). Overall, 773,233 patients with stage IV cancers
remained for the analysis. The distribution of stage IV cancers by primary tumor site is shown in Table 1 and illustrated by Figure 2.
The distribution by stage at presentation, categorized by primary tumor site, is shown in Figure 3.
The median age of patients with stage IV cancer was

60 years to 69 years. The lowest median age group
was for patients with cervical cancer (aged 50 years-59
years) and the highest median age group was for
patients with kidney cancer (aged 70 years-79 years).
Overall, 32.6% of the patients with stage IV disease
had private insurance (252,176 patients), 50.3% had
Medicare (388,834 patients), 6.0% had Medicaid
(46,260 patients), and 4.4% were uninsured (33,715
patients). The percentage of uninsured patients in the
NCDB study population was greatest for cancers of
the cervix (12.1%) and breast (5.8%) and was lowest
for kidney (3.8%), colon (3.9%), and prostate (3.9%)
cancer. The majority (621,197 patients; 80.3%) of
patients with stage IV cancer were white. Overall,
12.5% (96,763 patients) of patients were black, 3.7%
(28,713 patients) were Hispanic, and 1.9% (14,720
patients) were API.

Percentage of Untreated Patients

Of the 773,233 patients with stage IV cancers, 159,284
(20.6%) received no anticancer therapy. The percentage of
patients with stage IV tumors receiving no anticancer therapy, categorized by the site of the primary tumor, is detailed
in Table 1. Patients with lung cancer accounted for 68%
(108,485 patients) of the total of untreated patients with
stage IV tumors. Patients with cancers of the colon (18,816
patients; 11.8%), kidney (12,079 patients; 7.6%,), breast
(7313 patients; 4.6%), prostate (6582 patients; 4.1%), and
rectum (4305 patients; 2.7%) accounted for the remaining
majority of untreated patients (Fig. 2). Kidney cancer,
NSCLC, and uterine cancer had the highest rates of no
treatment at 25.5% (95% CL, 25.1%, 25.9%), 24.7%
(95% CL, 24.6%, 24.9%), and 24.7% (95% CL, 22.0%,
26.9%), respectively, whereas prostate and breast cancer
had the lowest rates at 11.1% (95% CL, 10.9%, 11.4%)
and 12.8% (95% CL, 12.5%, 13.1%), respectively.
Patient Characteristics and Association With
Lack of Treatment

Tables 2 and 3 present the distribution by patient age,
gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status, and socioeconomic status of the untreated population with stage IV
disease categorized by primary tumor site. Among the
untreated patients, the majority (33.1%) were aged 70
years to 79 years. Overall, 20.8% of the untreated patients
5950

with stage IV disease had private insurance (33,108
patients), 61.6% had Medicare (98,138 patients), 5.3%
had Medicaid (8403 patients), and 4.8% were uninsured
(7639 patients). Among the untreated patients with stage
IV disease, 79.5 % were white (126,676 patients), 13.1%
were black (20,790 patients), 4.0% were Hispanic (6326
patients), and 1.8% were API (2853 patients).
There were significant differences in the percentage
of untreated stage IV cancers across gender, age, and racial
categories (Fig. 4). Females had a higher likelihood of
being untreated compared with men for kidney cancer
(28.2% vs 24.0%; PR, 1.18 [P < .001]), SCLC (21.6% vs
21.0%; PR, 1.03 [P ¼ .035]), rectal cancer (18.5% vs
15.2%; PR, 1.22 [P < .001]), and colon cancer (16.1% vs
15.3%; PR, 1.06 [P < .001]). Older patients were more
likely to be untreated than younger patients across all
cancer types. For every 10-year increase in age, the
percentage of untreated patients increased by 35%
(NSCLC: PR, 1.35; 95% CL, 1.34, 1.36 [P < .001]) to
49% (colon: PR, 1.49; 95% CL, 1.47, 1.51 [P < .001]).
Blacks were significantly more likely to be untreated for
stage IV cancer than whites for all tumors except uterine
cancer and SCLC (PR range, 1.05-1.32; all P < .001).
Likewise, among patients with kidney cancer, NSCLC,
SCLC, and prostate cancer, Hispanics were significantly
more likely to be untreated than whites (PR range,
1.15-1.41; all P < .001). Across all cancer types, patients

with no insurance (PR range, 1.90-2.19; all P < .01),
Medicaid (PR range, 1.12-1.83; all P < .01), or Medicare
(PR range, 1.73-2.45; all P < .001) were significantly
more likely to be untreated than patients with private
insurance.
There were statistically significant differences with
regard to the percentage of untreated patients with stage
IV cancer by median income and educational status
(Table 3). For every 5% increase in the population without a high school education living in a patient’s ZIP code,
the percentage of untreated patients increased significantly (PR range, 1.02-1.09; all P < .001 except uterus).
Conversely, for every additional $10,000 of median
income for the population living in a patient’s ZIP code,
the percentage of untreated patients decreased significantly (PR range, 0.91-0.98; all P < .01 except uterus).
DISCUSSION
On the basis of the current analysis, representing 773,233
patients diagnosed with 8 common solid tumors in the
Cancer

December 1, 2012

United States over an 8-year period, nearly 1 in 5 patients
presenting with stage IV solid tumors never receive anticancer therapy. In a hypothesis-generating analysis, we also
observed that older age, racial and ethnic minority status,
lack of medical insurance, and lower income were all associated with an increased likelihood of not receiving treatment.
The percentage of untreated patients varied by primary tumor site from 11.1% to 25.5%. Not surprisingly,
patients with breast and prostate cancer were the least
likely to remain untreated, which may be related to the
high rates of screening for these cancers11 and the relatively tolerable hormonal therapies available for the treatment of metastatic disease. Patients with NSCLC had the
highest rate of being untreated and accounted for > 50%
of untreated patients during this time period. The percentage of untreated patients increased with age across all
tumor subtypes. These findings are not unexpected
because age-related comorbidities and decline in functional status have clear implications with regard to the
risk-to-benefit ratio of systemic therapy.12 A recent study

by Wang et al13 indicated that, in veterans aged > 65 years
with NSCLC, advanced age was an even stronger predictor than comorbidity for receiving treatment. In this population, a high percentage of patients with metastatic
disease did not receive treatment (66% of patients aged 65
years-74 years, 77% of patients aged 75 years-84 years,
and 90% of patients aged > 85 years).13 These results further highlight the potential disconnect between the ‘‘efficacy’’ of therapies in the setting of clinical trials and the
‘‘effectiveness’’ of such therapies when applied to the general population of patients with advanced cancer.
There are likely multiple reasons why patients with
metastatic cancer may not receive anticancer therapy,
including appropriate reasons such as poor functional status, comorbidities, and patient preference. Furthermore,
5952

there are likely several factors that contribute to patients
presenting with advanced, rather than early stage, cancer.
Tumor biology, with rapid disease onset and progression,
may play a predominant role in some patients. However,
racial/ethnic minority status and/or poor access to care
have previously been identified as factors associated with
an increased likelihood of presenting with an advanced
stage of disease at diagnosis.14-16 For example, Halpern et
al demonstrated that nonwhite patients who were without
insurance or with Medicaid were at a significantly
increased risk of presenting with advanced stage disease
for breast, colorectal, bladder, prostate, uterine, thyroid,
kidney, and lung cancers.9 A propensity score analysis of
patients treated at VA hospitals versus fee-for-service
Medicare patients indicated that VA patients had

equivalent or better survival rates for colon cancer,
NSCLC, SCLC, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, suggesting potentially superior preventive care or cancer
screening.17 Other studies have observed decreased
screening rates in racial minorities, underinsured patients,
and the elderly.18,19 Taken together, these findings suggest that certain patient groups may not only be more
likely to present with cancers at later stages, but may also
be less likely to receive any anticancer therapy whey they
are ultimately diagnosed.

It is interesting to note that the development of better tolerated and/or more effective treatments may have
some impact on the number of patients who are
untreated. For example, in the current study, the percentage of untreated patients with metastatic kidney cancer was 26.8% (CL, 23.4, 29.3) in the pre-vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR TKI) era (2000-2005), and decreased to
22.8% (CL, 21.3, 24.0) in the VEGFR TKI era (20062008). However, even with the introduction of better
5953

Original Article

therapies, there remains a large percentage of untreated
patients.
A strength of the current analysis is the large data set
representing a diverse population of patients and the focus
on a contemporary time period. In addition, because cancer registrars actively report ‘‘no first-course treatment’’ to
the NCDB, the assignment of patients to the ‘‘untreated’’
category was not simply based on an absence of data
regarding treatment. The trends observed, particularly
with regard to the increased percentage of untreated
patients with advancing patient age, add some further
confidence to the validity of the data. However, the current study has several limitations. Foremost, we used the
NCDB Public Benchmark Reports and did not have
access to individual patient data. Therefore, we could not
perform multivariable analysis to determine which potentially related variables associated with an increased prevalence of untreated metastatic cancer retained independent
significance. Therefore, the findings regarding patient
characteristics associated with an increased likelihood of
being untreated can only be considered hypothesis-generating. Further evaluation using individual patient data are
warranted. Although the NCDB includes data for >75%
of new cancer cases in the United States annually, CoCapproved hospitals often provide more cancer-related services (including cancer screening, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy) than non-CoC-accredited hospitals and
therefore these findings may not be generalizable to nonCoC-accredited hospitals and may, in fact, be an underestimation of the prevalence of this group. Finally, the current study focused on patients with advanced/metastatic
disease at the time of the initial cancer diagnosis and the
percentage of untreated patients with metastatic disease
may be substantially lower for patients initially presenting
with earlier stage disease and later developing metastatic
recurrence.
In summary, a large percentage of patients presenting with advanced solid tumors at the time of their initial
cancer diagnosis receive no anticancer therapy. Further
studies are necessary to better define the reasons for this
lack of treatment, particularly because these relate to
access to care, health literacy, and treatment disparities.
