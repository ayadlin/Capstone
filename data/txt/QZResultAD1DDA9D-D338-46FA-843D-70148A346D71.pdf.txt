BACKGROUND. It is believed that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs
during the development and progression of cancer; however, the correlation
between tobacco smoking and EMT remains to be elucidated.

METHODS. Cells from the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma cell line A549 were
exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P) for 24 weeks, and morphology, proliferative
activity, and gene expression profiles were analyzed.

RESULTS. Although no apparent morphologic changes were observed, the B[a]Pexposed A549 cells exhibited enhanced proliferative activity in 1% bovine serum
that contained medium, and dramatic changes in expression levels were
observed in a large number of genes. Of those, the expression of EMT-related

genes, such as migration-stimulating factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fibronectin, twist, transforming growth factor-b2, basic fibroblast growth factor,
and electron transport system, were up-regulated; whereas gene expression of Ecadherin was decreased. Most enhanced expression levels remained 8 weeks after
the retrieval of B[a]P in culture.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that B[a]P seems to induce EMT in
lung cancer cells, and it also may drive disease progression in patients with lung
cancer. Cancer 2007;110:369–74.  2007 American Cancer Society.

igarette smoking is not only a risk factor for lung carcinogenesis but also may accelerate the biologic behavior of lung cancers. A number of clinical researchers have reported on the
aggressiveness of lung cancer in patients who smoke.1–4 The risk of
developing lung cancer gradually decreases in individuals who
stop smoking within 10 to 15 years after they start, however, thereafter, the risk of lung carcinogenesis becomes steady.5 This phenomenon may be explained by the existence of both reversible and
irreversible effects of smoking on lung carcinogenesis. Certain
chemical compounds in tobacco smoke, such as aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines, cause loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and
mutation, resulting in abnormal proliferation through the dysfunction of tumor suppressor genes or the acceleration of oncogenes.6,7
Such genetic alterations are almost irreversible. The reversible
effects mostly concern changes in molecular expression. Generally,
molecules that are involved in the process of invasion or metastasis are not the same as oncogenes or recessive oncogene products,
both of which affect the cell cycle. We previously examined several
molecules, such as macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF),8
type II hexokinase (HEKII),9 and ubiquitin-ligase protein S-phase
kinase-interacting protein (Skp2),10 in clinical lung cancer tissues

and observed an association between their expression levels in tumor tissues and the smoking status
of patients as well as the clinical aggressiveness of
tumors. We hypothesized that tobacco smoke modulates the biologic features of cancer cells. In the
current study, we examined the effect of long-term
exposure to B[a]P on the morphology, proliferation,
and gene expression levels of lung cancer cells.
A549, a cell line that was established from bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, which is considered the least
relevant to smoking with regard to the effect on carcinogenesis in patients with lung cancer, was used
in this study, because the in vitro effect of B[a]P in
A549 cells may be more recognizable.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
A549 is a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma cell line with
a cytochrome 450P 1A1*1 genotype and was cultured
in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) under standard cell culture conditions at 378C
and 5% carbon dioxide in a humid environment.
Development of A549 Cells Exposed to B[a]P
for a Long Duration
A549 cells were cultured in 10% serum medium that
contained a 1-lM solution of B[a]P (C20H12; purity,
>96%; purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Coompany, St.
Louis, Mo) for a long duration (B[a]P-A549 cells).
B[a]P was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at
a concentration of 100 lM and was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 1:100 (final concentration, 1 lM), which was determined through
preliminary experiments with reference to our previous report.11 These cells were compared with cells
that were exposed only to DMSO (control) (DMSOA549 cells). After 24 weeks of B[a]P treatment, the
A549 cells were cultured in 10% serum medium that
contained only DMSO for 8 weeks (R-A549 cells).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-Carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-Sulfonyl)-2H-tetrazolium Assay
We used the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, Wis) to
evaluate cell growth rates. To evaluate the proliferative activity in a 1% concentration of media, 200 lL
of an exponentially growing cell suspension
(2 3 103 cells) were seeded in the wells of a 96-well
microtiter plate. Then, the cells were incubated for
48 hours at 378C. To evaluate the growth rate in
10% FBS and 1% FBS, 200 lL of an exponentially
growing cell suspension (5 3 102 cells) were seeded
in the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours,

120 hours, or 144 hours at 378C. Then, 20 lL of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution were added to each
well, and the plates were incubated for another 4
hours at 378C. The optical density was measured at
490 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Each experiment was performed using 4 replicate wells for each
drug concentration.

Microarray Analysis
Standard Affymetrix Gene Chip protocols (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, Calif) were used. RNA extracted from
peripheral blood leukocytes underwent 1 additional
round of RNA amplification, because there were limited RNA yields from the early samples of the study.
Amplification was performed starting with 100 ng of
total RNA using the Ambion MEGAscript RNA amplificaion kit according to the manufacture’s protocols.
All labeled samples were hybridized to HG-U95Av2
GeneChip data and were analyzed using Microarray
Suite (MAS 5.0; Affymetrix) and DNA Chip Analyzer
software using the PM only model. Present and
absent calls were determined with MAS 5.0. Statistically significant changes in gene expression were
measured by using the Significance Analysis of
MicroArrays statistical technique. The changes in
expression level by culture condition were interpreted as positive when the gene expression levels in
B[a]P-A549 cells or R-A549 cells were >2-fold or
<0.5-fold the levels in DMSO-A549 cells. We further
defined reversible gene expression changes if the
degree of increase or decrease from baseline control
levels (in DMSO-A549 cells) changed to <50% of the
level of B[a]P in the R-A549 cells.

RESULTS
Effect of Long-term Treatment With B[a]P on A549 Cells
B[a]P-A549 cells had greater proliferative activity
compared with A549 cells that were cultured with
media containing DMSO (DMSO-A549 cells). With
this B[a]P treatment, apparent morphologic changes
were not observed from the exposure (Fig. 1A and
B); however, the proliferative activity was increased
(Fig. 1C), and LOH was recognized at the locus of
MSH2, a DNA repair protein, by using a microsatellite marker of D2S123.12 In the 54,675 genes that we
examined in a microarray analysis, substantial
expression was recognized in 21,349 genes in the
DMSO-A549 (control) cells. Among them, increased
or decreased expression levels were observed in 5491
genes as a result of the treatment. To examine the reversibility of the changes in gene expression, we also
analyzed B[a]P-A549 cells 8 weeks after the removal
of B[a]P from the medium (R-A549 cells). In an analysis of the R-A549 cells, 1021 genes returned to

DMSO-A549 levels (reversible changes), whereas
4470 genes remained unchanged (irreversible
changes). Messenger RNA (mRNA) for glutathione-Stransferase M3, which is known to be induced by
B[a]P through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), was
increased by 3.17-fold in the B[a]P-A549 cells and
was partially decreased by 2.4-fold in the R-A549
cells. AhR was down-regulated in the B[a]P-A549 cells
by 0.53-fold and partially recovered by 0.713-fold in
the R-A549 cells. The genes for MIF and Skp2 showed
no substantial changes; however, the expression of
HEKII was up-regulated in the B[a]P-A549 cells by
2.1-fold and was partially reversed in the R-A549 cells
by 1.38-fold. In consideration of the large numbers
of chemical compounds in tobacco smoke, the B[a]P
experiment probably could not reflect all tobaccorelated modulations of molecular expression.

Gene Expression Analysis With Special Reference to EMT
Recently, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) has been reported as a process of acquiring
malignant potential in cancer cells, such as invasion
or metastasis.13,14 For the current report, we
hypothesized that there is an association between
the tobacco-induced modulation of multiple genes
and EMT, and we investigated multiple genes that
are involved in the EMT. We observed that the
expression levels of a number of important genes for
EMT were increased (Table 1). The expression levels
of migration-stimulating factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibronectin precursor mRNA were
up-regulated remarkably, by 38.9-fold, 32.6-fold, and
21.3-fold, respectively, compared with the levels in
DMSO-A549 cells, and remained up-regulated in
R-A549 cells. The degrees of increased expression of
the same 3 genes in B[a]P-A549 cells were ranked as
first, second, and seventh, respectively, among all of

sulfoxide (DMSO) only (control) for 24 weeks, as described in the text (see
Materials and Methods). After 24 weeks of treatment with B[a]P, A549 cells
were cultured in 10% serum medium that contained only DMSO for 8 weeks
(R-A549 cells). (A,B) Semiconfluent cultures of DMSO-A549 cells (A) and

B[a]P-A549 cells (black columns) showed significantly higher proliferative activity than DMSO-A549 cells (white columns) at Day 3 and 5, and R-A549
cells (hatched columns) showed intermediate activity. Results are representative of 4 replicate wells, and values are expressed as the mean  standard

the genes that we analyzed. Twist, which is a potent,
pivotal nuclear factor for multiple EMT-related
genes,15 also was up-regulated by 3.69-fold, and its
expression remained elevated in R-A549 cells. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b2, connective TGF
(CTGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
increased by 3.98-fold, 3.97-fold, and 3.58-fold,
respectively, but decreased to near their normal state

in R-A549 cells. Among the epithelial markers, mRNA
expression of E-cadherin and protocadherins
decreased in B[a]P-A549 cells, whereas expression of
N-cadherin and catenins remained stable. The loss
or reduction of E-cadherin expression is a representative characteristic of EMT and is an important part
of the metastatic process. In lung cancer, reduced
expression of E-cadherin reportedly was observed in
42% of patients.16 E-cadherin expression was not
normalized in R-A549 cells, probably because Twist,
which is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin,
maintained high expression levels in R-A549 cells.15
These results clearly indicate that B[a]P modulates
the expression of a large number of genes and implicate the linkage of EMT, tobacco smoke, and disease
progression in lung cancer.

DISCUSSION
Among the various adverse effects of smoking on the
respiratory cells, the formation of DNA adducts by its
metabolite, B[a]P diol oxide, and the generation of
oxidized guanine, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, are the
direct triggers of DNA alterations, such as LOH or
mutations.11,17 Most of the alterations are considered
irreversible, although some of them may be repaired
by specific proteins, such as Rad51/BRCA1 or oxoguanin glycosylase 1. We hypothesized that the
effects of smoking on respiratory cells included both
reversible and irreversible events and that the former
may affect cellular behaviors, such as motility, adhesion, and proliferation. In this report, we present
direct evidence that B[a]P induces EMT-related gene
expression in lung cancer cells; however, the important issue of reversibility remains to be clarified.
In fact, the cellular phenomenon in this experiment is not likely to differ from classic EMT, because
no morphologic changes occurred, and the changes
in several EMT-related genes were reversible. Classic
EMT is considered to be an irreversible event; however, changes in TGF-b2, basic FGF, and CTGF substantially were reversible in this experiment. The
expression of epithelial growth factor receptors, such
as epidermal growth factor receptor and c-met (a receptor for hepatocyte growth factor), exhibited
changes similar to those observed in growth factors
for mesenchymal cells (Table 1). Therefore, such reversible changes are reminiscent of reversible scatter,
which is a completely reversible and brief period
change of transcription to mesenchymal features
from epithelial cells.18,19 Ets, which is a key transcriptional factor, also reverted to the normal state
after the removal of B[a]P from the culture, although
the levels of Twist, another key transcriptional factor,

EMT by Benzo[a]Pyrene/Yoshino et al.

remained high. The B[a]P exposure in this study had
such a strong impact that multiple transcriptional
changes of the genes driving EMT and LOH occurred.
Therefore the reversibility of these genes may be
associated with the duration of the abnormal condition. B[a]P, although it is a strong carcinogen, is only
1 of >4000 chemical compounds in tobacco smoke,
and the exposure for 24 weeks to B[a]P may have
been too short to mimic the clinical effects of smoking. Classically, the transdifferentiation of epithelial
cells into other types of epithelial cells has been
observed in the retinal pigmented cells that become
lens epithelia20 and in the pancreatic acinar cells
that become hepatocytes.21 It remains to be clarified
whether the transition to mesenchymal cells from
epithelial cells (EMT) is a middle phase of transdifferentiation.
The solid tumors accompanied by fibrosis are
characterized by aggressive invasiveness. Schirrhus
cancer of the stomach has vast fibrosis in stroma
and shows aggressive expansion both horizontally
and perpendicularly.22 In this type of gastric cancer,
we previously reported high expression levels of
Wisp-1 variant, a family of CTGF.23 In bronchioloalveolar carcinoma type lung cancer, central fibrosis
occurs over time as the malignant potential, such as
invasion to basement membrane and of lymph node
metastasis, increases,24 although no critical molecule
that works in this process has been identified.
Patients with pulmonary fibrosis have a significantly
high risk of lung cancer, and mesenchymal transition
from alveolar cells recently was reported as a source
of increasing fibroblasts in the disease.25 The
mechanisms of fibrosis and of EMT have a common
molecular profile; therefore, carcinogenesis frequently occurs in the pathologic state of organ fibrosis. Previously, it was reported that immortalized
breast epithelial cells, by introduction of c-Ha-ras,
resulted in a progression of changes in the morphology, proliferation, and invasiveness by treatment of
B[a]P.26 Our results may support such morphologic
and functional effects by B[a]P, although we observed
no direct evidence of changes in cellular behavior
from the B[a]P treatment in this study.
In conclusion, B[a]P, which is an aromatic hydrocarbon, directly caused EMT-like, dynamic changes
in gene expression, indicating that EMT is involved
in the carcinogenesis and progression of lung cancer.
This simple study may indicate that tobacco is a
growth factor for lung cancer. Further analyses and a
better understanding of this mechanism may lead to
developments in the management and treatment of
patients with cancer.
