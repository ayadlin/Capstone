ABSTRACT
There is abundant epidemiological evidence that heavy alcohol intake contributes
to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Previous reports indicated that
connexin 32 (Cx32), which is a major hepatocyte gap junction protein, is downregulated in chronic liver disease and has a protective role in hepatocarcinogenesis.
However, functions of Cx32 in alcohol-related hepatocarcinogenesis have not been
clarified. To evaluate them, 9-week-old Cx32 dominant negative transgenic (Tg) rats
and their wild-type (Wt) littermates were given 1 % or 5 % ethanol (EtOH) or water
ad libitum, for 16 weeks after an intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (200
mg/kg). EtOH significantly increased the incidence and multiplicity of HCC and total
tumors in a dose-dependent manner in Tg rats, but not in Wt rats. Although the number
and area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci were not
significantly different between the groups, EtOH increased the Ki-67 labeling indices
in GST-P positive foci only in Tg rats. EtOH up-regulated phosphorylated Erk1/2 with
decrease of the Erk1/2 inhibitor, dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) in
whole livers of Tg and Wt rats. Immunofluorescence staining and quantitative RT-PCR
revealed that EtOH significantly increased nucleolar localization of phosphorylated
Erk1/2 and contrastingly reduced Dusp1 protein and mRNA expression in GST-P
positive foci and HCC of Tg rats as compared to those of Wt rats. These findings
suggest that Cx32 dysfunction like in chronic liver disease promoted EtOH-associated
hepatocarcinogenesis through dysregulation of Erk-Dusp1 signaling.

alcoholic beverage in humans (classified as Group 1), and
the report concluded that the occurrence of primary liver
cancer is casually related to alcohol intake [3]. Excessive
alcohol consumption of >40 to 60 g/day for more than 5
years is a well-known factor that increases the risk of HCC
by nearly 5-folds [4].
Several animal experiments have revealed that
ethanol (EtOH) treatment promotes chemically-induced
hepatocarcinogenesis [5–10], however, conflicting
results regarding the mode of action of EtOH in
hepatocarcinogenesis have also been reported [11].
Lifelong exposure to 3% EtOH did not induce HCC

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most
common cause of cancer-related mortality. An estimated
782,500 new liver cancer cases and 745,500 deaths
occurred in 2012 worldwide [1]. Alcohol is one of the
most important risk factor for the cause of HCC especially
in developed countries, and the incidence of alcoholrelated HCC has recently tended to increase in Japan [2].
In the recent monograph published by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there is
‘sufficient evidence’ that demonstrate carcinogenicity of

in rodents [12] whereas 10% EtOH ingestion for 18
months induced HCC development [13]. These results
suggest that EtOH is an established carcinogen, which is
consistent with the IARC evaluation of EtOH. However,
the detailed molecular mechanisms by which EtOH
contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis have not been fully
elucidated to date.
Gap junctions formed by connexin hemichannnels
exchange small molecules (<1kDa) between adjacent
cells and play important roles in the maintenance of tissue
homeostasis, the control of cell growth and differentiation
[14, 15]. Hepatocytes express two connexin proteins,
Cx32 which is the major protein and broadly expressed,
and Cx26 which is localized at the periportal zone
[16–18]. The expression of Cx32 was down-regulated in
preneoplastic and HCC lesions in rats [19], and gradually
decreased during progression of chronic liver disease
including viral hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC in humans
[20, 21]. Reduction of Cx32 expression and gap junctional
intercellular communication (GJIC) capacity also occurred
in an age-dependent manner in rat [22]. We previously
established transgenic rats, which carried a dominant
negative mutant of Cx32 under the control of the albumin
promoter (Tg) and harbored broadly disturbed membrane
localization of endogenous Cx32 and Cx26 proteins and
decreased GJIC as measured by gap junction assay. Tg rats
are characterized as having higher susceptibility to DENinduced hepatocarcinogenesis as compared with wildtype (Wt) littermate rats [23, 24]. These findings suggest
that Cx32 has a protective role in hepatocarcinogenesis
in rodents and humans. However, the relationship
between Cx32 and EtOH-related hepatotoxicity including
hepatocarcinogenesis has not been clarified.
In the present study, we examined the role of Cx32 in
alcohol-related hepatocarcinogenesis using a Tg rat model
to investigate the molecular mechanisms in preneoplastic
and neoplastic lesions. Further, to assess the genes
responsible for alcohol-related hepatocarcinogenesis,
cDNA microarray analysis was performed.

induced expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (Cyp2e1),
which is one of the metabolic enzymes for EtOH, in
the centrilobular region in a dose-dependent manner in
both Tg and Wt rats, and protein expression of Cyp2e1
in this area was higher in Tg rats than that in Wt rats
(Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B). The expression
of Cx32 and Cx26, which are hepatocyte gap junction
protein, were diffusely decreased in Tg rats as compared
to those in Wt rats (Supplementary Figure 2A), and the
expression of Cx32 and Cx26 on the cell membrane in Wt
rats were not altered by EtOH intake (Figure 1B). The dye
loading assay also revealed that there was no significant
difference in the capacity of gap junction between each
group in Wt rats (Supplementary Figure 2B and 2C).

EtOH promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in Tg rats
Induction of liver tumors was observed in both Tg
and Wt rats that received EtOH. The liver tumors, which
lost normal lobular architecture with solid cell growth
and high mitotic counts in histology, were defined as
HCC (Figure 1C). Most of the HCCs were found in the
Tg-5%EtOH group. The incidence and multiplicity of
HCC and/or HCA are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1D.
The incidence of HCC and total tumors (HCA+HCA)
was significantly increased by EtOH intake in a dosedependent manner in Tg rats. On the other hand, induction
of tumors was also observed in Wt rats that ingested EtOH,
however, there was no significant correlation between
tumor incidence and dosage of EtOH. Consequently,
the incidence of HCC and total tumors was significantly
higher in Tg rats as compared to that in Wt rats (Table
2). The multiplicity of HCC and total tumors was also
significantly increased by EtOH intake only in Tg rats
(Figure 1D).

EtOH enhances cell proliferation in
preneoplastic lesions in Tg rats
Total glutathione S-transferase placental form
(GST-P) positive areas including GST-P positive foci
(diameter > 200 μm) as preneoplastic lesions, HCA and
HCC were increased in Tg rats as compared to those in
Wt rats regardless of EtOH intake, and tended to increase
with EtOH intake only in Tg rats. However, EtOH intake
did not affect the number and area of GST-P positive
foci among each group in both Tg and Wt rats (Figure
2A). According to these results, we hypothesized that
EtOH promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by elevation of
proliferation in hepatic preneoplastic foci. To verify the
hypothesis, we measured Ki-67 labeling index in GST-P
positive foci of each group. The index were significantly
increased by EtOH in a dose-dependent manner in Tg rats,
and correlated with tumor incidence and multiplicity. In
contrast, EtOH did not affect the Ki-67 labeling indices
in GST-P positive foci of Wt rats, indicating that EtOH

increased proliferation activity only in Tg rats (Figure
2B and 2C). The Ki-67 labeling index was substantially
higher in HCC than in GST-P positive foci, and correlation
between GST-P positive area and Ki-67 labeling index
was observed (Pearson correlation coefficient, r=0.39,
p=0.0001, n=71) (Figure 2D). These results suggest that
EtOH may contribute to the promotion phase during
hepatocarcinogenesis.

in Tg rats are listed in Table 3. Among these genes, we
focused on Dusp1 and Dusp4, whose expression levels
were decreased by EtOH in Tg rats, because some
members of Dusp family are known to be inhibitors of
MAPK signaling including the Erk pathway. Quantitative
RT-PCR confirmed that Dusp1 mRNA expression was
down-regulated by EtOH treatment in both genotypes,
and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that Dusp1
protein expression tended to be decreased by EtOH in
both genotypes, especially in Tg rats (Figure 4A and
4B). On the other hand, the mRNA expression of Dusp4,
another member of the Dusp family, was too low and no
significant difference was detected among the groups by
quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). Therefore, further
analyses focused only on Dusp1 expression especially
in GST-P positive foci, since EtOH increased nucleolilocated pErk in GST-P positive foci of Tg rats compared
with that of Wt rats. The mRNA and protein levels of
Dusp1 in GST-P positive foci were significantly decreased
in Tg rats treated with EtOH as compared to those in
treatment-matched Wt rats. EtOH intake also significantly
decreased the Dusp1 protein expression as compared to
the no treatment group of Tg rats (Figure 4C and 4D). To
elucidate the relationship between localization of pErk
and Dusp1 in HCC and GST-P positive foci, we performed
triple immunofluorescence staining for pErk, Dusp1 and
GST-P. Expression of Dusp1 was lower in HCC than in
normal hepatocytes (Figure 5A). In addition, lower Dusp1
expression was observed in GST-P positive foci than that in
normal hepatocytes in the Tg-5%EtOH group. Moreover,
the Dusp1 expression level was inversely correlated with
pErk expression in nucleoli in both HCC and GST-P
positive foci of Tg rats that received EtOH (Figure 5B).
These results suggest that EtOH treatment and Cx32
dysfunction decreased Dusp1 expression which led to Erk
activation in GST-P positive foci. Therefore, the interaction
of Erk and Dusp1 may be involved in the promotion of
EtOH-related hepatocarcinogenesis in Tg rats.

EtOH activates Erk signaling pathway in Tg rats
To elucidate how EtOH promotes increased cell
proliferation during hepatocarcinogenesis in Tg rats,
we examined the expression of proteins in the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that play
crucial roles in tumorigenesis. Western blot analyses
revealed that Erk1/2 were activated in the liver of
Tg and Wt rats given EtOH, although c-Raf was not
affected. In addition, phosphorylated Elk1 (pElk1) and
cyclin D1 expression were increased by EtOH intake
in Tg rats, but not in Wt rats (Figure 3A). These results
suggest that EtOH promotes cell proliferation in Tg rats
through the Erk signaling pathway. Next, we analyzed
the localization of activated Erk in HCC, HCA, GST-P
positive foci and adjacent non-tumor tissue in the liver of
each group. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that
phosphorylated Erk 1/2 (pErk) was found in the nucleoli
of neoplastic lesions as well as GST-P positive foci in
each group although nucleolar pErk was not observed in
normal hepatocyte (Figure 3B). The frequency of nucleolilocalized pErk in GST-P positive foci was significantly
increased by EtOH intake only in Tg rats (Figure 3C and
3D). We also examined the expression of activated protein
1 (AP-1) transcription factors including c-Fos and c-Jun,
which are downstream targets of Erk signaling and known
to play pro-oncogenic roles in HCC [25]. Quantitative
RT-PCR revealed that there was no significant difference
in the mRNA expression of these two molecules between
each group (Supplementary Figure 3A). Phosphorylated
c-Jun (p-c-Jun) was increased in GST-P positive foci
as compared to that in surrounding non-tumor tissues,
however, EtOH did not affect p-c-Jun levels in GST-P
positive foci in both Tg and Wt rats (Supplementary
Figure 3B). These observations suggest that other
molecules rather than c-Jun and c-Fos contribute to the
promotion of cell proliferation by Erk during alcoholrelated hepatocarcinogenesis.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we clearly demonstrated
the enhancing effects of EtOH on DEN-induced
hepatocarcinogenesis via Cx32 dysfunction. These results
are considered to reflect the strong association of alcohol
intake with HCC development in patients with chronic
hepatitis since Cx32 is down-regulated in hepatitis,
cirrhosis and aging. EtOH intake in rats of the 5% EtOH
group was approximately 2.5 g/kg/day which is equivalent
to 150 g/day for a human who is 70 kg in weight. However,
since the activity of the alcohol metabolizing enzyme,
alcohol dehydrogenase, in rat liver has been reported to
be 4 - 5 times higher than that in human liver [26], the
equivalent ingested amount would be 30 - 37.5 g/day/70
kg person after adjusting for the difference in metabolizing
enzyme activity. This is speculated to be the marginal level

Dusp1 expression in preneoplastic foci
To further clarify the mechanisms of alcohol-related
hepatocarcinogenesis, cDNA microarray analysis was
performed using liver tissues of 5%EtOH and control

of EtOH intake for elevating the risk of alcohol-related
HCC development in human. In fact, only a small number
of tumors were observed in Wt rats in contrast to Tg rats
that were susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis.
One effect of EtOH in the whole livers of both
genotypes was up-regulation of pErk protein expression,
while pElk1 and cyclin D1 were increased by EtOH
treatment only in Tg rats. Since a previous paper suggests
that alcohol consumption increases the percentage of pErkpositive sinusoidal lining cells in rats [13], the labeling
index in sinusoidal lining cells was measured in this study.
The pErk-positive sinusoidal lining cells were significantly
increased by EtOH treatment in both Tg and Wt rats, and
there was no significant difference between genotypes
(Supplementary Figure 4A), which was consistent with the
results by western blot analysis. The Ki-67 labeling index
in sinusoidal lining cells was also analyzed to investigate
whether pErk induction affects proliferative activity in
these cells, and we found that it was not altered among
the groups (Supplementary Figure 4B). Concerning to the

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression of pErk in GST-P positive foci, EtOH increased
the percentage of nucleoli-localized pErk and Ki-67
positivity in hepatocytes of GST-P positive foci in Tg rats,
and there effects were not observed in Wt rats. Elk1 is
known to be activated by phosphorylated Erk, p38 Mapk
or Sapk/Jnk [27], and only Erk was activated among these
MAPK (Supplemantary Figure 5) in our study. Several
reports have described the relationship of Cx32 with cell
proliferation and cyclin D1 expression: (a) proteome
analysis indicated that Cx32 indirectly interacted with Erk
[28], (b) radiation-induced liver tumors in Cx32 knock-out
mice had increased pErk staining compared with that in
Wt mice [29], and (c) overexpression of Cx32 decreased
cyclin D1 expression and caused G1 arrest in liver cancer
cells [30]. These reports and our data in the present study
suggest that nucleolar pErk may induce expression of
pElk1 and cyclin D1, promote cell proliferation in GST-P
positive foci and increase incidence of HCC only in Tg
but not Wt rats although the detailed mechanisms and
intermediary factors are not known.

Therefore, microarray analysis was performed to
elucidate these factors, and we focused on Dusp1 as a
candidate regulator of pErk via Cx32 dysfunction in
EtOH-related hepatocarcinogenesis, because Dusp1 is
known to inhibit MAPKs including Erk. Dusp1 is known
to inhibit MAPKs including Erk, and its down-regulation
was reported to be a valuable factor for poor prognosis
in HCC patients [31]. It has been demonstrated that
Dusp1 expression in the liver is associated with the
difference in susceptibility of different strains of rats

to hepatocarcinogenesis[32]. Recently, Lawan et al.
demonstrated an increase in hepatic lipogenesis and
inhibition of CREB-mediated glucogenesis in liverspecific Dusp1 knock-out mice, which indicate that
Dusp1 also contributes to steatosis including ALD
and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [33].
Therefore, Dusp1 may be a potential target of prevention
of the development of EtOH-related HCC as well as
ALD and NAFLD.

It has been reported that the expression levels
of both Dusp1 and Cx32 are positively regulated by
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in hepatocytes [34, 35].
Methionine adenosyltransferase 1 alpha (MAT1A),
which encodes the SAM synthesizing enzyme, was
demonstrated to be reduced in the patients with ALD, and
MAT1A knock-out mice showed increased susceptibility

to hepatocarcinogenesis leading to development of HCC
[36]. SAM exerted preventive effects in chemically-induced
rat hepatocarcinogenesis and in an orthotopic-inoculated
HCC rat model [37, 38]. These findings suggest that the
chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of SAM are through
Dusp1-Erk and Cx32, and it is likely that the Cx32-Dusp1-

Erk signaling pathway was deeply involved in the promotion
of hepatocarcinogenesis by EtOH in our Tg rat model.
With regard to the molecular mechanisms by which
EtOH contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo models,
Mercer et al. demonstrated that the Wnt/β-catenin signal
pathway was activated in EtOH-related DEN-induced
hepatocarcinogenesis in mice [9]. They reported that
multiplicities of both eosinophilic liver cell foci and
hepatocellular adenoma were significantly increased by
EtOH treatment whereas HCC was not increased. These
observations suggested that the Wnt/β-catenin signal
pathway was not associated with malignant transformation
in EtOH-related hepatocarcinogenesis. In contrast to their
findings, it is likely that the Cx32-Dusp1-Erk signaling
axis is profoundly involved in the entire carcinogenic
process throughout all of the progression steps; namely,
Dusp-Erk signaling is activated even in preneoplastic
lesion in our present study.
In conclusion, Cx32-Dusp1-Erk interaction may
contribute to the tumor promoting activity of EtOH
and subsequent development of hepatocarcinogenesis.
The data in the present study provide evidence that the
Cx32-Dusp1-Erk signaling pathway is a potential target
for chemoprevention and alternative therapy in EtOHrelated hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition, the Cx32
dominant negative transgenic rats used in this study

hepatocarcinogenesis because HCC can be induced by
EtOH in a short period of time.

drinking water (n=12). All rats were sacrificed at the
sixteenth week following the initiation of treatment.

Biochemical analysis
Blood was collected by puncture of the abdominal
aorta in anesthetized rats and separated serum by
centrifugation (3,000 rpm) was transferred into tubes.
Plasma albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and
total cholesterol were determined by The Tohkai
Cytopathology Institute: Cancer Research and
Prevention (Gifu, Japan).

Histological analysis of the livers
The livers were immediately excised, weighed and
cut into slices 3 to 4 mm thick. They were then fixed in
10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and routinely
processed for histological evaluation (3 μm thick). Sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and were
also used for immunohistochemistry using anti-Cyp2e1
(Enzo Biochem Inc., New York, NY), anti-GST-P (Medical
& Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), anti-pErk
(Thr202/Tyr204), anti-p-c-Jun (Ser73) (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-Ki-67 (Abcam plc,
Cambridge, UK) antibodies and anti-Dusp1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. Double
immunostaining for Ki-67 and GST-P or Ki-67 and p-c-Jun
were performed using a previous method with modifications
[39]. The section was incubated with a primary antibody
against Ki-67 and visualized with DAB, and then the
primary antibody was inactivated by heat treatment (95°c)
for 10 min in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Thereafter
the section was incubated with a second antibody against
GST-P or p-c-Jun and visualized with the Vina Green
Chromogen Kit (Biocare Medical, LLC. Concord, CA).
The average number and area of GST-P positive foci whose
size was more than 200 μm in diameter, and the total area
of the liver section were measured with an image analyzer
(Keyence, Osaka, Japan) (n=11-12). The proportion of
hepatocytes positive for Ki-67, pErk, and p-c-Jun in GST-P
positive foci (n=11-12), and the population of sinusoid lining
cells positive for Ki-67 and pErk (n=5) were measured by
counting at least 1,000 cells. The intensity score of Dusp1
immunostainings was evaluated using an image analyzer
and associated software (Keyence), and was represented as
a value relative to the Wt-control group (n=5 and 10 foci /
rat, respectively).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal experiment
The establishment, production and screening of Tg
rats carrying the mutated Cx32 gene were as previously
described in detail [23]. Male Tg rats were produced
by mating heterozygous males with Wt SpragueDawley females (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan). Rats
were maintained in plastic cages on hardwood chips in
an air-conditioned specific pathogen-free animal room
at 22 ± 2°C and 50% humidity with 12h/12h light-dark
cycle. All animal experiments were performed under
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and use Committee of Nagoya City School of Medical
Sciences. All heterozygous male Tg and Wt littermate rats
were administrated a single intraperitoneal injection of
200 mg/kg DEN (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co, Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) dissolved in saline at 9 weeks of age. Thereafter
they received 1 % or 5 % EtOH (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) or water ad libitum for 16
weeks: Tg-5%EtOH, Tg rats drinking 5% EtOH (n=12);
Tg-1%EtOH, Tg rats drinking 1% EtOH (n=12); TgControl, Tg rats drinking water (n=12); Wt-5%EtOH,
Wt rats drinking 5% EtOH (n=12); Wt-1%EtOH, Wt
rats drinking 1% EtOH (n=12); and Wt-Control, Wt rats

assay kit (Bio-Rad laboratories, Hercules, CA). Samples
of 50 μg were mixed with SDS sample buffer, heated at
100°C for 10 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The
proteins were separated in 12% acrylamide gels and then
transferred onto Hybond-ECL membranes (GE Healthcare
UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK). The antibodies used
were against phosphorylated c-Raf (Ser338) (p-c-Raf), Erk
1/2, pErk, p38Mapk, phosphorylated p38Mapk (Thr180/
Tyr182) (p-p38Mapk), pElk1 (Ser383), Sek1/Mkk4,
phosphorylated Sek1/Mkk4 (Ser80) (pSek1/Mkk4), Sapk/

cyclin D1, Dusp1 (Cell Signaling Technology), c-Raf (BD
bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and Cyp2e1 (Enzo Biochem
Inc.). Equal protein loading was ascertained by western
blotting with a β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich corp.).

Triple immunofluorescence
immunohistochemistry for pErk,
Dusp1 and GST-P
Immunofluorescence staining for pErk, Dusp1 and
GST-P was performed according to a modified protocol
[39]. A monoclonal rabbit antibody for pErk (Cell
Signaling Technology) was used with biotin-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-labeled streptavidin (Thermo
Fischer Scientific Inc.) in an immunoreaction enhancer
solution, Can Get Signal (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and
then incubated at 95°c for 10 min in 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0). Thereafter a polyclonal rabbit antibody against
GST-P was used with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
and Cy5-labeled streptavidin (Thermo Fischer Scientific
Inc.), and finally the section was incubated with an Alexa
Fluor 350 conjugated rabbit anti-DUSP1 polyclonal
antibody (Bioss Inc., Boston, MA). The nuclei were
stained with Propidium Iodide (Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, CA).

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Isogen reagent
(Nippon Gene Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). One microgram of
RNA was converted to cDNA with avian myeloblastosis
virus reverse transcriptase (Takara, Otsu, Japan) in 20
μl reaction mixture. Aliquots of 2 μl of cDNA samples
were subjected to quantitative PCR in a total volume of
25 μl using SYBR Premix ExTaqII (Takara) in a light
cycler apparatus (Roche Diagnostic). Primers used for
amplification of each mRNA were as follows:
Dusp1
forward,
5′-TGTAGCACCCCTCTCTACGA-3′; Dusp1 reverse,
5′-GACAATTGGCCGAGACGTTG-3′; c-Jun forward,
5′-TCATCCAGTCCAGCAATGGG-3′; c-Jun reverse,
5′-TATGCAGTTCAGCTAGGGCG-3′; c-Fos forward,
5′-ACCACGACCATGATGTTCTC-3′; c-Fos reverse,
5′-GACAGATCTGCACAAAAGTC-3′.

Gap junction assay
This procedure was performed according to the
method described in an earlier report [40]. Briefly, liver
samples were obtained from Wt rats with each treatment
(4 rats per group) and treated with Lucifer yellow (SigmaAldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO), a stain that can pass through
the gap junction channel, and rhodamine-dextran (SigmaAldrich Corp.), which does not cross through the channel,
to measure gap junction capability. Liver slices were cut
to 5 mm-thick and 3 incisions of 1 mm depth were made,
followed by the addition of a mixture of fluorescent dyes
containing 0.05% Lucifer yellow and 0.05% rhodaminedextran in PBS into the incisions. After 3 minutes, the slices
were washed 3 times with PBS and frozen. Thereafter 7 μm
thick frozen sections were made and spread of the dye was
measured using an image analyzer (Keyence).

Microarray analysis
Gene expression analysis was performed using
a Rat Oligo chip 20k (Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hepatic RNA
expression of the 4 experimental groups (Tg-5%EtOH,
Tg-Control, Wt-5%EtOH and Wt-Control) was compared.

Laser microdissection
The detailed methods employed in this study have
been described previously [41] . Seven-micron thick frozen
sections (6-8 sections) were mounted onto slides with films
(Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and fixed in acetone
for 10 min. The sections were treated with a polyclonal
rabbit antibody against GST-P with RNaseOut (Thermo
Fischer Scientific Inc.) for 25 min subsequently exposed
to secondary antibody using the DAKO ENVISION™
System (DAKO Co., Tokyo, Japan) with RNaseOut and
2.5 μM EDTA for 25 min at 4°C and visualized with DAB
after incubation for 5 min at room temperature. After
immunostaining of the frozen tissue, laser microdissection

Western blotting
Liver tissues were homogenized with T-PER Tissue
Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific
Inc.) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostic,
Mannheim, Germany) on ice. Protein concentrations
were determined by the Bradford method using a protein
