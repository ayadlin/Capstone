Abstract
Malignant transformation and maintenance of the malignant phenotype depends on oncogenic and nononcogenic proteins that are essential to mediate oncogene signaling and to support the altered physiologic demands
induced by transformation. Protein kinase CK2 supports key prosurvival signaling pathways and represents a
prototypical non-oncogene. In this study, we describe CX-4945, a potent and selective orally bioavailable small
molecule inhibitor of CK2. The antiproliferative activity of CX-4945 against cancer cells correlated with expression
levels of the CK2a catalytic subunit. Attenuation of PI3K/Akt signaling by CX-4945 was evidenced by dephosphorylation of Akt on the CK2-specific S129 site and the canonical S473 and T308 regulatory sites. CX-4945 caused
cell-cycle arrest and selectively induced apoptosis in cancer cells relative to normal cells. In models of angiogenesis,
CX-4945 inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration, tube formation, and blocked CK2-dependent
hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) transcription in cancer cells. When administered orally in murine xenograft
models, CX-4945 was well tolerated and demonstrated robust antitumor activity with concomitant reductions of the
mechanism-based biomarker phospho-p21 (T145). The observed antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic responses to
CX-4945 in tumor cells and endothelial cells collectively illustrate that this compound exerts its antitumor effects
through inhibition of CK2-dependent signaling in multiple pathways. Finally, CX-4945 is the first orally bioavailable
small molecule inhibitor of CK2 to advance into human clinical trials, thereby paving the way for an entirely new
class of targeted treatment for cancer. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10288–98. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer is a disease of cellular dysregulation arising from an
accumulation of genetic errors and overexpression of elements
required to maintain the transformed state (1, 2). Mutations
arising in receptor tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine
kinases are frequently implicated in oncogenesis and have
consequently been the focus of extensive efforts to design
molecularly targeted anticancer therapies (3). Other proteins,
including kinases, that may not be directly transformative
but serve to sustain the cancer phenotype have been less
considered as anticancer targets until recently. A new model
of cancer is emerging, whereby the establishment and maintenance of malignancy depends on the cooperation of deregulated oncogenes and an array of equally essential deregulated

non-oncogenes (1, 4). Although oncogenes are critical for direct
transformation, non-oncogenes are required for maintaining
the transformed phenotype. The overexpression or deregulation of typically nonmutated non-oncogene products protects
the cell from the increased burden of cellular stress that is an
invariable hallmark of transformation resulting from oncogenic activation (1, 2, 4). As this overexpression of otherwise
normal proteins is required to maintain oncogenic signaling,
inhibition of non-oncogenic signaling represents an underexploited therapeutic approach for targeting processes essential for maintaining the cancer phenotype.
Among the proteins that sustain the transformed phenotype, protein kinase CK2 has recently become recognized as a
prototypical non-oncogene (5). Protein kinase CK2 is a tetrameric enzyme composed of 2 catalytic (a and/or a0 ) subunits
and 2 regulatory (b) subunits. CK2 is a highly conserved,
constitutively active serine/threonine protein kinase that
regulates multiple pathways including PI3K/Akt and WNT
signaling cascades, NF-kB transcription, and the DNA damage
response (reviewed in refs. 6 and 7). CK2 can be described as a
promoter of the hallmarks of cancer, further emphasizing the
known pleiotropy of this kinase. Although CK2 has long been
known for its proproliferative and anti-apoptotic properties,
an understanding of the extensive contribution of this protein
kinase to tumor maintenance is just beginning to emerge (5).

Antitumor Mechanisms of the Selective CK2 Inhibitor CX-4945

In keeping with its non-oncogene profile, mutations in CK2
have not been reported. However, CK2 gene amplifications
and an associated reduction in patient survival have been
described in squamous cell lung cancer (8). Likewise, CK2
activity and expression levels are elevated in many cancers of
diverse genetic background including breast (9), lung (8),
prostate (10), colorectal (11), renal (12), and leukemias (13),
and the overexpression of CK2 in cancer tissues has frequently
been linked to disease progression and poor prognosis
(reviewed in refs. 14 and 6). Collectively, these characteristics
identify CK2 as a scientifically validated cancer target that
remains unexploited as a therapeutic target.
Non-oncogenic proteins fall into 2 broad categories: intrinsic, which principally regulate prosurvival processes within the
cancer cell, and extrinsic, which develop and support the
tumor microenvironment (1). CK2 may be described as promoting both intrinsic and extrinsic non-oncogenic processes
as a consequence of its impact on multiple signaling pathways.
CK2 does not function simply as a signal transduction kinase
in the classical sense, mediating "longitudinal signaling" from
the cell surface to the nucleus, but rather plays a "lateral role"
in multiple prosurvival signaling cascades (5, 6). These include
intrinsic processes such as the regulation of cell-cycle proteins,
PI3K/Akt signaling, and apoptosis pathways (reviewed in refs.
6, 7, and 15). The PI3K/Akt pathway is the most commonly
altered signaling pathway in human cancers (16) and this
pathway is susceptible to activation by CK2 (17, 18). Furthermore, CK2 has been characterized as a "master regulator" of
angiogenesis (19), an extrinsic non-oncogene–driven process.
CK2 is elevated under hypoxic conditions, regulates hypoxiainducible transcription factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) activity (20)
and mediates the aberrant response of epithelial cells to
growth factor signaling (21). Thus, CK2 drives both intrinsic
and extrinsic processes to promote the cancer phenotype.
Several research groups have reported that inhibition of
CK2, either by siRNA directed toward CK2a (22) or by using
chemical CK2 inhibitors such as 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (23) and 2-(dimethylamino)-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (24), induced apoptosis and prevented the
proliferation of cancer cells. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides directed toward CK2a have been shown to induce
apoptosis and exhibit antitumor activity in xenograft models
(22, 25). Given the generalized overexpression of CK2 in
cancers, the central role of CK2 in multiple pathways that
support the cancer phenotype and the evidence that CK2 is an
essential protein for cancer cell survival, the development of
selective CK2 inhibitors has emerged as an attractive targeted
approach for the treatment of cancers (26).
Herein we describe CX-4945, a potent, selective, and ATPcompetitive inhibitor of both isoforms of the CK2 catalytic
subunits CK2a and CK2a0 with IC50 values of 1 nmol/L. CX4945 inhibited prosurvival and angiogenic signaling in cancer
cell lines and exhibited antitumor activity in murine xenografts. Collectively, these studies indicate that the antitumor
mechanism of action is mediated through inhibition of CK2dependent intrinsic and extrinsic processes required to maintain the cancer phenotype. Finally, CX-4945 is the first orally
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CK2 to advance into

human clinical trials, thereby paving the way for an entirely
new class of targeted treatment for cancer.

Materials and Methods
Materials
CX-4945 5-(3-chlorophenylamino)benzo[c][2,6]naphthyridine-8-carboxylic acid) was synthesized by Cylene Pharmaceuticals as a golden colored solid material (>99% pure by
high-performance liquid chromatography assay). A 5 mmol/L
stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared and stored
at 70 C. The drug was diluted directly into growth media
immediately prior to use.
Enzyme assays
The 238 kinase selectivity panel was conducted using the
Kinase Profiler service offered by Millipore, which utilizes a
radiometric filter-binding assay. The percent inhibition of
each kinase was estimated using 0.5 mmol/L CX-4945 at
ATP concentrations equivalent to the Km value for ATP for
each respective human recombinant kinase. The determination of IC50 values was done at ATP concentrations equivalent
to the Km for ATP for each kinase using 9 concentrations of
CX-4945 over a range of 0.0001 to 1 mmol/L. The Ki value
(inhibition constant) for CX-4945 against recombinant CK2
was determined by graphing the IC50 values of CX-4945
determined in the presence of various concentrations of
ATP against the concentration of ATP. The Ki value is equivalent to the Y-intercept according to the Cheng–Prussoff
equation (ref. 27; Ki ¼ IC50/(1þ[ATP]/Km), where Ki is the
inhibition constant and Km is the Michaelis constant.
Cell culture
SUM 149PT and SUM 190PT inflammatory breast cancer
cells were purchased from Asterand. Human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Lonza Inc.. All
other cell lines were purchased from American Tissue Culture
Collection. Cell lines were cultured according to the suppliers’
recommendations.
Akt pathway analysis
BT-474 (breast) or BxPC-3 (pancreatic) cancer or HUVEC
cells were treated with a range of concentrations of CX-4945
for the durations stated in the figure legends. Cells (1–3  106)
were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 100 mL of lysis
buffer [RIPA Buffer purchased from Sigma; 1 mmol/L dithiothrietol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Serine

purchased from Cell Signaling.
Alamar Blue cell viability assay
Various cell lines were seeded at a density of 3,000 cells per
well 24 hours prior to treatment, in appropriate media, and
then treated with indicated concentrations of CX-4945. Suspensions cells were seeded and treated on the same day.

Following 4 days of incubation, Alamar Blue (20 mL, 10% of
volume per well) was added and the cells were further
incubated at 37 C for 4–5 hours. Fluorescence with excitation
wavelength at 530–560 nm and emission wavelength at
590 nm was measured.
CK2 levels in breast cancer cells
Breast cancer cells were plated in 15-cm dish format overnight. Cells were collected at 50% confluence by scraping into
ice-cold PBS. The RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy kit
(QIAGEN) and relative levels of CK2a, CK2a0 , CK2b, and
b-actin mRNA were measured using Applied Biosystems’
proprietary primers-probe sets. Analyses were performed on
a 7900HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Protein levels of CK2a, CK2a0 , CK2b, and b-actin were measured
by Western hybridization. Primary antibodies (CK2a0 and
CK2b) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CK2b from Millipore, and b-actin from Sigma.
Cell-cycle analysis
Untreated and CX-4945–treated BT-474 and BxPC-3 cells were
harvested by trypsinization, washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed
with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 4 hours. Cells were washed with
PBS and RNA was digested for 1 hour at 37 C in staining buffer
(0.25 mg/mL RNase A, 0.025 mg/mL propidium iodide, in PBS).
Cells were analyzed with a BD LSR II flow cytometer, histograms
were generated with BD FACS Diva Software v4.1.2, and cell-cycle
phases analyzed with ModFit LT 3.1 SP3.
Caspase 3/7 activation
Caspase 3/7 enzyme activity was evaluated over a range of
CX-4945 concentrations in multiple cell lines with CaspaseGlo assay kit (Promega). The luminescence of each sample was
measured in a plate-reading luminometer (SpectraMax M5;
Molecular Devices) with parameters of 1-minute lag time and
0.5-second/well read time. Caspase activity was normalized to
cell number as measured by CyQUANT (Invitrogen).
In vitro models of angiogenesis
HUVEC proliferation, migration and tube-formation experiments were performed by Southern Research Institute. Experimental details are provided in the supplementary materials.
Hypoxia studies
BT-474 and BxPC-3 cells were plated in 10-cm dish format
overnight. On the following day, the cells were treated with
CX-4945 in degassed CO2-independent media (Invitrogen)
for 48 hours under normoxic or hypoxic (94% N2, 1% O2, and
5% CO2) conditions. At the end of treatment, cells were
collected by scraping into ice-cold PBS. The RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and relative
levels of aldolase, pVHL, and p53 mRNA were measured
using Applied Biosystems’ proprietary primer-probe sets.
Analyses were performed on a 7900HT Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems).
Luciferase reporter assay
HeLa cells were transfected with pHIF1-Luc vector
(Panomics) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen).

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were treated
with a range of concentrations of CX-4945 for 20 hours under
normoxic or hypoxic (94% N2, 1% O2, and 5% CO2) conditions. At the end of treatment, HIF-1a transcriptional activity was measured by luciferase assay. The resulting data were
normalized for cell number determined with CyQUANT
(Invitrogen).
In vivo studies in animals
Female immunocompromised mice CrTac:Ncr-Foxn1nu (5–
7 weeks old) were obtained from Taconic Farms. Animals were
maintained under clean room conditions in sterile filter top
cages. Animals received sterile rodent chow and water ad
libitum. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide: The Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals.
Efficacy studies
Xenografts were initiated by subcutaneous injection of
BxPC-3 cells into the right hind flank region of each mouse
or BT-474 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of
mice implanted with estrogen pellets. When tumors reached a
designated volume of 150-200 mm3, animals were randomized
and divided into groups of 9 to 10 mice per group. CX-4945 was
administered by oral gavage twice daily at 25 or 75 mg/kg for
31 and 35 consecutive days for the BT-474 and BxPC-3 models,
respectively. Tumor volumes and body weights were measured twice weekly. The length and width of the tumor were
measured with calipers and the volume calculated using the
following formula: tumor volume ¼ (length  width2)/2.
Percent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) values were calculated
on the final day of the study for CX-4945–treated compared to
vehicle-treated mice and were calculated as 100  {1  [(TreatedFinal day  TreatedDay 1)/(ControlFinal day  ControlDay 1)]}.
The significance of the differences between the treated
versus vehicle groups were determined using 1-way ANOVA
(Graphpad Prism).
Pharmacodynamic studies
Xenografts bearing BxPC-3 tumors (300–400 mm3) were
randomized and divided into 3 groups of 5 mice. CX-4945 was
administered by oral gavage twice daily at 25 or 75 mg/kg for 3
days. Four hours after the final dose of CX-4945, the animals
were euthanized, and tumors were resected and fixed in 10%
buffered formalin for 24 hours before transferring to 70%
ethanol. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for phospho-p21
(T145) was performed at Vel-lab Research. Stained tumor
sections were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence
microscope (Zeiss) and the degree of staining was quantified
using Axiovision40AV.4.5.0.0 software.

CK2(Fig. 1A). A full description of its discovery and synthesis
will be provided elsewhere. CX-4945 proved to be a potent and
ATP-competitive (Fig. 1B) inhibitor of recombinant human
CK2 (CK2a IC50 ¼ 1 nmol/L and Ki ¼ 0.38 nmol/L  0.02;
CK2a0 IC50 ¼ 1 nmol/L) and was found to be selective for
CK2 when evaluated in a biochemical kinase screen. Using a
single concentration of 500 nmol/L (500-fold greater than
the IC50 of CK2), only 7 of the 238 kinases tested were
inhibited by more than 90% and those 7 were further
subjected to IC50 determination (Column 1, Table 1). It is
well understood that enzymatic potency determined in cellfree systems does not always translate into biological activity, therefore, CX-4945 (10 mmol/L) was evaluated in relevant
cell-based functional assays for FLT3, PIM1, and CDK1, and
was found to be functionally inactive against these kinases
(data not shown).

Antiproliferative activity and CK2 expression
When profiled against a panel of diverse cancer cell lines,
CX-4945 exhibited a broad spectrum of antiproliferative activity. COMPARE analysis (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/docs/compare/
compare_methodology.html) of these data (Fig. 1C) indicated
that the breast cancer cell lines displayed the widest range of
sensitivity to CX-4945.
In addition to assessment of the antiproliferative activity, a
panel of 11 breast cancer cell lines was further characterized
to determine potential predictors of sensitivity to CX-4945. For
this panel of cell lines, mRNA and protein expression levels of
the CK2 subunits were determined (representative Western
blot shown in Fig. 2). An apparent correlation was found
between sensitivity to CX-4945 and CK2a mRNA, and protein
levels (Table 2) but no correlations were observed between
sensitivity to CX-4945 and either mRNA or protein levels of the

shown to be inactive against key kinases within this pathway
(Column 2, Table 1), we examined the effects of CX-4945 on
CK2-regulated PI3K/Akt activity. For this analysis we chose 2
models on the basis of their PI3K status: (1) BT-474 breast
cancer cells that bear an activating PIK3CA mutation and (2)
BxPC-3 pancreatic cells in which overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor activates wild-type PI3K signaling by heterodimerization with HER3 (29). Treatment of
BT-474 cells and BxPC-3 cells with CX-4945 led to rapid
dephosphorylation of the CK2 phosphorylation site, Akt
(S129) (Fig. 3A), which was accompanied by significant reductions in the phosphorylation levels of both canonical regulatory
sites Akt (T308) and Akt (S473). No significant reduction in
PTEN phosphorylation at the CK2 phosphorylation sites, S370/
S380, were observed at this 4-hour time point (data not shown)
suggesting that CX-4945 suppresses PI3K/Akt signaling by
directly blocking the phosphorylation of Akt at Serine 129
by CK2 rather than through activation of PTEN.

CX-4945 suppresses PI3K/Akt signaling in cancer cells

cell-type–dependent manner (30–35). Activated Akt has been
reported to phosphorylate and thereby decrease the proteosomal stability of the p21 and p27 cell-cycle inhibitor proteins
allowing cell-cycle progression (36, 37). Treatment of cells with
CX-4945 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of p21 (T145)
and increased levels of total p21 and p27. Interestingly, treatment of BT-474 cells with CX-4945 induced a G2/M cell-cycle
arrest, whereas treatment of BxPC-3 cells caused arrest to
occur in G1, indicating that cell-cycle regulation by CK2 is celltype dependent (Fig. 3B). Because both CK2 and its substrates
such as Akt, may protect cells from apoptosis by phosphorylating a wide range of proteins involved in the apoptotic
response (35, 38–40), we examined levels of caspase 3/7

activity in a set of transformed and normal cell lines in
response to CX-4945 treatment. All cancer cell lines
responded to the 24-hour treatment with CX-4945 by induction of caspase 3/7 activity in a concentration-dependent
manner, whereas all normal cell lines failed to show a
detectable change in caspase 3/7 activity at concentrations
as high as 100 mmol/L (Fig. 3C).
Angiogenesis
Normoxia. CK2 has been described as a master regulator of angiogenesis due to its role in multiple molecular events that contribute to angiogenesis (19). This
includes regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which has a

well-characterized role in mediating the response of HUVEC
to growth factor signaling (41). Treatment of HUVEC with
CX-4945 led to the rapid dephosphorylation of the CK2
phosphorylation site Akt (S129) in addition to both canonical regulatory sites, Akt (T308) and Akt (S473) and the
downstream Akt effector, p21 (T145) (Fig. 4A). We also
examined PTEN phosphorylation in response to CX-4945
treatment. We observed a reduction of phosphorylation at
the CK2-phosphorylation sites on PTEN (S370/S380) and a
concomitant reduction in total PTEN levels, but only after 24
hour exposure to CX-4945. Next we measured the effects of
CX-4945 on the ability of HUVEC to proliferate, migrate, and
form tube-like structures as a result of serum stimulation in
vitro. CX-4945 inhibited HUVEC proliferation (IC50 ¼ 5.5
mmol/L at 72 hour; data not shown), migration (IC50 ¼ 2
mmol/L at 24 hour), and tube formation (IC50 ¼ 4.0 mmol/L
at 18 hour; Fig. 4B).
Hypoxia. Hypoxia, a condition often found in solid
tumors, is known to increase CK2 activity leading to the
upregulation of histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2)
that inhibit the expression of tumor-suppressor genes pVHL
and p53, both of which control the activity of HIF-1a, a major
regulator of proangiogenic signaling (20, 42, 43). Therefore, we
investigated the effects of CK2 inhibition on HIF-1a–dependent transcription under hypoxic conditions. Using qRT-PCR
(quantitive real-time PCR), we demonstrated that exposure of
BT-474 and BxPC-3 cells to hypoxia for 48 hours resulted in the
activation of HIF-1a transcriptional activity, as indicated by a
2- to 3-fold increase in levels of aldolase mRNA, a known target
of HIF-1a transcription. Moreover, hypoxia reduced the levels
of pVHL (2- to 3-fold) and p53 (2-fold). Treatment of BT-474
and BxPC-3 cells with CX-4945 under hypoxic conditions
prevented downregulation of p53 and pVHL and reduced
activation of HIF-1a transcription as measured indirectly
by a reduction of aldolase expression (Fig. 4C). These data
were corroborated by the results obtained with a pHIF-1a/Luc
reporter system in which CX-4945 inhibited hypoxia-activated
HIF-1a–driven expression of luciferase in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 4D).
Antitumor efficacy of CX-4945
Antitumor efficacy studies were conducted in BT-474 and
BxPC-3 xenograft models in which CX-4945 showed dosedependent antitumor activity in both models when administered orally twice a day (Fig. 5A and B). In the BT-474 model,
CX-4945 (25 or 75 mg/kg) exhibited 88% and 97% TGI,
respectively, with 2 of 9 animals in each group showing more
than 50% reduction in tumor size compared with the initial
tumor volume. In the BxPC-3 model, CX-4945 (75 mg/kg)
showed 93% TGI with 3 animals having no evidence of tumor
remaining at the end of the treatment period. Extensive
preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic evaluation of CX4945 has been performed and will be described in a separate
publication. In brief, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of
CX-4945 was 15 mmol/L occurring at 15 minute postdose,
which rapidly decreased to submicromolar levels (Clearance,
CLs ¼ 2.7 L/kg/h), suggesting that efficacy was driven by Cmax
rather than sustained exposure above a threshold. CX-4945

was well tolerated at all doses tested as indicated by minimal
body weight loss and no overt toxicity.
Pharmacodynamic studies
CX-4945 was evaluated for its effect on p21 (T145) in BxPC-3
xenograft tissue using immunohistochemical methods. The
data shown represent scoring derived from 4 representative,
random images taken from each of 3 tumors per group
(Fig. 5C). When compared to the vehicle group, the 25 and
75 mg/kg groups showed dose-dependent reductions in the
phosphorylation of p21 (T145) consistent with the antitumor
effects observed with these dose levels (representative images
shown in Fig. 5C).

Discussion
In the reported studies we describe a novel, orally bioavailable inhibitor of protein kinase CK2 and the consequences of
inhibiting this enzyme in a variety of biological assays. We
have shown that CX-4945 modulated PI3K/Akt signaling, cellcycle progression, regulatory CDK proteins p21 and p27, and
ultimately apoptosis in cancer cells. Our findings are consistent with the results obtained with the relatively nonselective
natural product CK2 inhibitors apigenin and emodin, which
have previously been reported to increase levels of p21 and
p27, induce cell-cycle arrest, and trigger apoptosis in cancer
cells (44, 45). CK2 has been shown to regulate PI3K/Akt
signaling at multiple junctions along the signaling cascade
including the Akt protein (reviewed in ref. 6). The phosphorylation of Akt by CK2 (at residue S129) has been reported to
hyperactivate Akt beyond the activity level achieved by the
phosphorylations of the canonical regulatory sites, T308 and
S473 (17, 46). We have shown that CX-4945 treatment of the
BT-474 and BxPC-3 cancer cell lines resulted in significant
reductions in the phosphorylation of Akt (S129) with corresponding decreases in the phosphorylation of the canonical
regulatory sites Akt (T308) and Akt (S473). Although the extent
of modulation of Akt (T308) and Akt (S473) compared with
Akt (S129) dephosphorylation varied between cell lines, these
results highlight the specificity of Akt (S129) phosphorylation
by CK2 and suggest that cell-type–specific factors influence
the degree to which Akt (S129) and hence CK2 regulates Akt
signaling. Moreover, modulation of Akt (S129) may serve as a
valuable mechanism of action biomarker to determine the
extent of pharmacodynamic modulation of CK2. Although the
antibody reagents and methods to detect Akt (T308) and Akt
(S473) are available and used in the clinical setting, validation
of Akt (S129) antibodies, IHC and other clinically relevant
detection methods are under development.
CK2 has been described as a master regulator of angiogenesis (19). Indeed, chemical inhibitors of CK2 have previously
been shown to inhibit proangiogenic activity in HUVEC and
block retinal neovascularization in mice (19, 21, 47). PI3K/Akt
signaling is known to regulate the response of endothelial cells
to growth factor signaling including proliferation, migration,
and tube formation (41), and thus represents a molecular
mechanism through which CK2 may drive angiogenic signaling. CX-4945 inhibited HUVEC proliferation, migration, and

tube formation. The treatment of HUVEC with CX-4945 led to
rapid dephosphorylation of Akt (S129) and also Akt (T308) and
Akt (S473). Dephosphorylation of the CK2 phosphorylation
sites on PTEN (S370/S380) was observed only after 24 hour
exposure to CX-4945 with concomitant reductions in total
PTEN levels. Neither of the CK2 phosphorylation sites on
PTEN or the levels of total protein were significantly affected
after 4-hour treatment, yet dephosphorylation of Akt was
readily observed, suggesting that the effects of CX-4945 on

of CK2-regulated PTEN activity.
Another mechanism by which CK2 may contribute to
angiogenesis is via regulation of HIF-1a. Hypoxia, a condition
that is often present in solid tumors, stimulates HIF-1a and
increases the activity of CK2, thereby mediating proangiogenic
responses required for adaptation to hypoxia (20, 42, 43).
Elevated CK2 activity results in the upregulation of HDAC1/
HDAC2 histone deacetylases that inhibit the expression of

tumor-suppressor genes pVHL and p53, both of which
downregulate the activity of HIF-1a (20, 42, 43). CX-4945
inhibited hypoxia-driven HIF-1a activity in cancer cells and
prevented downregulation of pVHL and p53, potentially
indicating that CX-4945 inhibits CK2 regulation of histone
deacetylases. Collectively these data demonstrate that
CX-4945 inhibits angiogenic signaling in HUVEC and inhibits
HIF-1a transcription under hypoxia, suggesting that CK2
inhibition effectively disrupts important adaptive processes
required to promote the tumor microenvironment.
The hypothesis that tumors rely on CK2 for survival was
tested in murine xenografts. BT-474 breast cancer and BxPC3 pancreatic xenografts were selected for antitumor efficacy
studies. CX-4945 exhibited robust antitumor activity including partial and complete regressions. In vivo administration
of CX-4945 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of the Akt
substrate p21 (T145) in tumor xenograft tissue demonstrating a clear pharmacodynamic effect in mice. CX-4945 was
well tolerated as indicated by minimal body weight loss and
no evidence of overt toxicity.
The network of proproliferative signaling pathways supported by CK2 can be best described within the context of
"intrinsic" and "extrinsic" non-oncogene–driven processes.
Herein, we have characterized CX-4945 as an inhibitor of
both "intrinsic" and "extrinsic" CK2-driven mechanisms and
demonstrated that CX-4945 is efficacious and well tolerated in
xenograft models. Furthermore, we have shown that sensitiv-

ity to CX-4945 correlates with the expression levels of CK2a in
a panel of breast cancer cell lines suggesting a potential
strategy for patient selection. We have also demonstrated
that phospho-p21 (T145), serves as an effective mechanism of
action biomarker for CK2 inhibition in vitro and in vivo, and
may have immediate clinical relevance because there is an
established relationship between Akt activation, phospho-p21
(T145) status, and clinical prognosis in breast cancers (48, 49).
The pleiotropy and widespread distribution of CK2 in normal
tissues have raised concerns that inhibition of CK2 might give
rise to unacceptable toxicity. In practice, however, we have
shown that the consequences of CK2 inhibition are context
dependent and cancer cells are more vulnerable to CK2
inhibition than normal cells. CX-4945 represents the first
orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CK2 with
acceptable pharmaceutical properties to warrant advancement into human clinical trials, thereby opening the door
to an entirely new class of therapeutics for cancer patients.
