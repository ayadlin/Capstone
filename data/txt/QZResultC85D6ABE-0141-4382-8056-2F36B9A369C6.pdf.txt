ABSTRACT
Purpose: The present study is to discover a new genes associated with drug
resistance development in ovarian cancer.
Methods: We used microarray analysis to determine alterations in the level
of expression of genes in cisplatin- (CisPt), doxorubicin- (Dox), topotecan- (Top),
and paclitaxel- (Pac) resistant variants of W1 and A2780 ovarian cancer cell lines.
Immunohistochemistry assay was used to determine protein expression in ovarian
cancer patients.
Results: We observed alterations in the expression of 22 genes that were common
to all three cell lines that were resistant to the same cytostatic drug. The level of
expression of 13 genes was upregulated and that of nine genes was downregulated.
In the CisPt-resistant cell line, we observed downregulated expression of ABCC6,
BST2, ERAP2 and MCTP1; in the Pac-resistant cell line, we observe upregulated
expression of ABCB1, EPHA7 and RUNDC3B and downregulated expression of LIPG,
MCTP1, NSBP1, PCDH9, PTPRK and SEMA3A. The expression levels of three genes,
ABCB1, ABCB4 and IFI16, were upregulated in the Dox-resistant cell lines. In the
Top-resistant cell lines, we observed increased expression levels of ABCG2, HERC5,
IFIH1, MYOT, S100A3, SAMD4A, SPP1 and TGFBI and decreased expression levels of
MCTP1 and PTPRK. The expression of EPHA7, IFI16, SPP1 and TGFBI was confirmed
at protein level in analyzed ovarian cancer patients..
Conclusions: The expression profiles of the investigated cell lines indicated that
new candidate genes are related to the development of resistance to the cytostatic
drugs that are used in first- and second-line chemotherapy of ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

The second most important drug for ovarian cancer
treatment is Pac. Pac belongs to the family of antimitotic
anticancer agents and blocks mitosis through stabilizing
microtubules, leading to the blockage of cell division and
thus, cell survival [18]. The most important mechanism
underlying cancer-cell resistance to Pac is mediated
by MDR proteins such as P-gp [19, 20]. However,
other drug –transporters, such as ABCB4 (MDR3), can
also play a role in Pac resistance [21]. The other most
important mechanisms underlying Pac resistance are the
development of tubulin mutations [22] and the expression
of the less common tubulin isotypes [23].
The most important drugs used in the second-line
chemotherapy of ovarian cancer are Dox and Top. Top
and Dox are inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I and II,
respectively. Topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate
the overwinding or underwinding of the DNA helix
[24]. Topoisomerase I acts through scission of the DNA
backbone of one strand and mainly affects the transcription
and replication complexes [25]. In contrast, topoisomerase
II acts through scission of the DNA backbone of two
strands and acts mainly after replication has occurred [26].
Inhibiting DNA topoisomerase activities using poisons
such as Dox and Top causes the formation of irreversible
covalent cross-links between the topoisomerase and DNA,
leading to DNA breakage and consequently, to cell death.
Additionally, Dox is a planar compound that intercalates
into DNA, thereby block transcription and replication. The
main mechanism underlying the resistance to Dox and Top
is the expression of specific drug transporters; Dox and
Top are actively removed from cancer cells by P-gp and
BCRP, respectively [6, 27]. The most common mechanism
underlying the resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors is the
development of mutations that make these enzymes less
sensitive to their inhibitors [28].
However, it sometimes is difficult to explain the
development of drug resistance in cancer cells based on
the patterns of expression of the genes that are known to
be involved in drug resistance, which indicates that yetunknown genes and mechanisms are also involved in drug
resistance.
In this study, we compared the gene-expression
profiles of ovarian cancer cell lines resistant to the cytostatic
drugs used in first-line chemotherapy, CisPt and Pac, and
those used in second-line chemotherapy, Dox and Top.
Drug-resistant cell lines were derived from primary (W1)
or established (A2780) ovarian cancer cell lines. Alterations
in the levels of gene expression of the drug-resistant cell
lines were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays.

Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal
gynecological malignancies. Most patients are diagnosed
with an advanced disease and have a poor prognosis [1].
At the beginning of treatment, ovarian cancer is one of the
most treatable solid tumours. However, during treatment,
ovarian cancer cells may develop drug resistance, causing
further treatments to be ineffective in most cases [2].
The most significant mechanism underlying the
resistance to cytostatic drugs is their active removal from
cancer cells by drug transporters of the ABC family [3].
These transporters pump cytostatic drugs from cancer
cells using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis [4]. The
most important ABC transporters are glycoprotein P (Pgp), which is encoded by the ABCB1 (multidrug resistance
protein 1-MDR1) gene [5], and the breast-cancer resistance
protein BCRP, which is encoded by the ABCG2 gene [6].
Other mechanisms underlying cytostatic-drug resistance
include the following: inactivating the drugs using
detoxification enzymes, inactivating the drugs through
metallothionein or glutathione binding, repairing damaged
DNA, developing point mutations in the genes that encode
proteins that bind cytostatic drugs, and increasing the
activity of anti-apoptotic or pro-survival pathways as well
as disrupting apoptotic signaling pathways [7].
The first-line chemotherapy for advanced ovarian
cancer always involves a platinum-based drug [carboplatin
or cisplatin (CisPt)] and a taxane [paclitaxel (Pac) or
docetaxel] [8]. The second-line chemotherapy in the
case of platinum-sensitive disease generally includes
platinum-containing compounds and taxane [9]. In the
case of platinum-resistant disease, other cytostatic drugs,
such as liposomal doxorubicin (Dox), topotecan (Top) and
gemcitabine, are used [10, 11].
CisPt is the most frequently used antitumor agent
and the most important drug used in ovarian cancer
chemotherapy. This drug reacts with the nitrogen atoms
of DNA and preferentially reacts with the N-7 atom of
deoxyguanylic acid. This process results in intrastrand and
interstrand DNA cross-linking, consequently inhibiting
DNA synthesis and transcription [12]. Resistance to
CisPt can result from the following events: decreased
drug uptake [12]; increased reflux by drug transporters of
the ABC family such as MRP2 [13]; and increased drug
inactivation by sulfhydryl-containing molecules, such
as glutathione [14] and metallothioneins [15]. Another
important mechanism underlying CisPt resistance is
the repair of damaged DNA via DNA repair systems
[16]. The role of DNA damage response (DDR) is to
protect against genomic instability and therefore prevent
oncogenesis. However, it plays a dual role, not only in
cancer prevention but also in anticancer therapy. The
inhibition of some DDR pathways sensitize the therapy
to chemotherapeutic drugs and therefore abrogate the
chemoresistance. [17].

values for the parameters evaluated in the analysis of
the preliminary data, such as the background and noise
averages, percentage of present calls, presence of internal

W1TR cell lines, and the expression of five genes was
upregulated in both the A2780TR2 and W1TR cell lines.
For more detailed analysis, we selected genes with
expression that was up/down-regulated more than/less
than 5 and -5, respectively, in three cell lines that were
resistant to the same cytostatic drug. Table 1 and Figure 2
summarize our results.
Collective, the expression levels of 22 genes were
changed in three cell lines resistant to the same cytostatic
drug. The expression of 13 genes was upregulated and
that of nine genes was downregulated. We did not observe
the overexpression of any gene in the cell lines resistant
to CisPt. In contrast, we observed the underexpression of
four genes in the cell lines resistant to this drug, which
were the ABCC6, BST2, ERAP2 and MCTP1. In the Pacresistant cell lines, we observed upregulated expression
of three genes, ABCB1, EPHA7 and RUNDC3B. Six
genes were underexpressed in the Pac-resistant cell lines
LIPG, MCTP1, NSBP1, PCDH9, PTPRK and SEMA3A.
The Dox-resistant cell lines were characterized by the
increased expression of three genes, ABCB1, ABCB4
and IFI16. No gene was underexpressed in all three of
the Dox-resistant cell lines. We observed the upregulated
expression of eight genes in the Top-resistant cell lines
ABCG2, HERC5, IFIH1, MYOT, S100A3, SAMD4A,
SPP1 and TGFBI. The expression of two genes, MCTP1
and PTPRK, were downregulated in all three of the Topresistant cell lines.
The expression level of some genes had changed
in response to more than one cytostatic drug. The
expression of ABCB1 was increased in all of the Pacand Dox-resistant cell lines. The expression of EPHA7
was increased in three Pac-resistant cell lines and in one
Dox- and one Top-resistant cell line. IFI16 expression was
increased in all of the Dox-resistant cell lines but was also
increased more than four-hundred-fold in the A2780PR1
Pac-resistant cell line. We observed the increased
expression of IFIH1 in three Top-resistant cell lines and
in the A2780DR1 and A2780PR1 cell lines that were
resistant to Dox and Pac, respectively. MYOT expression
was increased in three Top-resistant cell lines and two Pacresistant cell lines. RUNDC3B expression was increased
not only in all of the Pac-resistant cell lines but also in
two of the Dox-resistant cell lines. S100A3 expression
was increased in all of the Top-resistant cell lines and in
two of the CisPt-resistant cell lines. SAMD4A expression
was increased in three Top- and two Pac-resistant cell
lines. SPP1 expression was very significantly increased in
all of the Top-resistant cell lines and one CisPt-resistant
cell line and was less significantly increased in two Doxresistant cell lines and one Pac-resistant cell line. The
level of expression of MCTP1 was decreased in all of the
CisPt-, Pac- and Top-resistant cell lines and also in one
Dox-resistant cell line. The expression of PTPRK was
decreased in all of the Pac- and Top-resistant cell lines
and in two of the three CisPt-resistant cell lines. The

Data analysis, gene lists and evaluations
The genes that were associated with Cis, Dox, Pac
or Top resistance were selected. The contribution to drug
resistance of the genes for which the expression level was
significantly changed in the drug-resistant cells relative
to that in their drug-sensitive counterparts by greater than
5-fold and less than 0.2-fold (up-/down-regulation of more
than/less than 5 and -5, respectively) was evaluated. Genes
with expression levels of between 5- and 0.2-fold those of
the controls were considered ‘not significant (NS)’ when
the gene lists were constructed.
Analysis of the gene expression of ovarian cancer
cell lines resistant to each cytostatic drug provided
information about the response of the cancer cells to the
different cytostatic drugs during treatment. Figure 1 is
a Venn diagram summarizing the number of transcripts
that were overexpressed and underexpressed in each pair
of cell lines and the relationship of these transcriptional
changes to those of the other cell-line pairs.
In addition to the four genes that were
underexpressed in all three of the Cis-resistant cell
lines, six genes were overexpressed and 13 genes were
underexpressed in both the A2780CR1 and A2780CR2
cell lines.
In addition to the three genes that were
overexpressed and the six genes that were underexpressed
in all three of the Pac-resistant cell lines, 14 genes were
overexpressed and eight genes were underexpressed in
both the A2780PR1 and A2780PR2 cell lines. Seven genes
were overexpressed and one gene was underexpressed in
both the A2780PR1 and W1PR cell lines and three genes
were overexpressed and six genes were underexpressed in
both the A2780PR2 and W1PR cell lines.
The expression of only three genes was changed
(overexpressed) in all three of the Dox-resistant cell
lines. The same seven genes were overexpressed and
other set of the same seven genes were underexpressed
in the A2780DR1 and A2780DR2 cell lines. One gene
was overexpressed in both the A2780DR1 and W1DR
cell lines and one gene was underexpressed in both the
A2780DR2 and W1DR cell lines.
In all three of the Top-resistant cell lines. we
observed the upregulated expression of eight genes and
the downregulated expression of two genes. Upregulated
expression of 14 genes and downregulated expression
of seven genes was observed in both the A2780TR1 and
A2780TR2 cell lines. One gene was overexpressed and
one gene was underexpressed in both the A2780TR1 and

expression of PCDH9 was downregulated in three Pacresistant cell lines, two Dox-resistant cell lines and in one
CisPt- and one Top-resistant cell line.
Of the 22 genes for which the expression levels
were analysed, the expression of three genes, ABCB1,
ABCG2 and SPP1, was very significantly upregulated
– by more than 50-fold – in three cell lines that were
resistant to the same cytostatic drug. We also observed
very greatly increased expression – by more 50-fold – of
ABCB4, IFI16 and RUNDC3B, although this expression
pattern was not shared by all of the cell lines resistant to
the same cytostatic drug. The genes with the most highly
downregulated expression – by more than 50-fold – were
BST2, PTPRK and SEMA3A.

3B). Strong (3) reaction was observed in nuclei of serous
adenocarcinoma cancer cells. The immunopositive cells
were detected also in the stromal cells surrounding the
tumour.
EPHA7 protein was detected in both ovarian serous
adenocarcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma cancer
cells (Figure 3C, 3D). In both types a weak (1) to moderate
(2) reaction was observed in the cytoplasm of cancer cells.
Moderate (2) positive reaction was observed for
SPP1 and TGFBI proteins (Figure 3E, 3F). Both proteins
were mainly localized in the cytoplasm of ovarian serous
adenocarcinoma cancer cells. The immunopositive cells
were detected also in the stromal cells and inflammatory
infiltrates surrounding the tumour.

Immunohistochemical analysis

DISCUSSION

Immunohistochemical analysis of selected (EPHA7,
IFI-16, SPP1 and TGFBI) proteins was tested in ovarian
cancer patients. The aim of this study was to verify
whether the altered expression of analyzed genes and
proteins observed in cell lines can be confirmed in a real
cancer patient tissues as well.
The positive expression of IFI16 was observed
in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma patients but not in
ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma ones (Figure 3A,

In this study alterations in the level of gene
expression were found in ovarian cancer cell lines that
were resistant to cytostatic drugs of first and second lines
of chemotherapy. The genes with expression levels that
were between 5- and 0.2-fold that of the control cells
were considered not to be significantly affected, and the
relationship between their expression levels and drug
resistance will not be discussed.

The microarray data were confirmed by the qPCR
results for genes representative of the MDR phenotype
(MDR1 and MDR3) (data not shown). Additionally, the
results of western blotting analysis of P-gp and BCRP
protein expression also correlated with the alterations in
the expression levels of the genes encoding these proteins
(data not shown).
To our knowledge, the results presented here are
the first to shown changes in the expression of genes in
ovarian cancer cell lines that were resistant to cytostatic
drugs of the first and second lines of chemotherapy.
The levels of gene expression were determined in three
resistant cell lines to make the results more credible.
Our results indicated that new genes are related to the
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

First, we selected the genes that were overexpressed/
underexpressed by at least 5-fold in the drug-resistant cell
lines relative to the levels in the control cells (Figure 1).
To obtain information about changes in gene expression
that occurred in response to exposure to cytostatic drugs.
Not surprisingly, we observed much greater similarity
in the altered gene expression patterns of the R1 and
R2 cell lines derived from the A2780 cell line that were
resistant to the same cytostatic drug than between those of
these two cell lines and that of a cell line resistant to the
same cytostatic drug but derived from the W1 cell line.
However, although the R1 and R2 cell lines were derived
from the same A2780 cell line under the same cell-culture
conditions, the general changes in their gene expression
patterns differed. This result indicated that even in the
same cell line and under identical cell culture conditions,

the response to cytostatic drugs can be different. This
finding indicate how difficult it is to predict the changes in
gene expression that will occur in response to cytostaticdrug treatment. However, changes in the expression levels
of some genes were common to all three cell lines that
were the cellular response to cytostatic drugs and were
therefore selected for more detailed analysis.
CisPt is the most important drug used to treat
ovarian cancer [8] as well as many other types of cancer
[12, 16]. We did not observe the increased expression of
any gene in any of the cell lines resistant to CisPt. This
finding is contrary to that of other study, which showed
the overexpression of the drug transporter MRP2 [13],
glutathione [14] or metallothioneins [15] in cell lines that
were resistant to CisPt. These discrepancies may be due
to the use of different models of study. In the other study,
the investigators compared pairs of sensitive or resistant
cell lines. In our study, we analyzed the expression of only
the genes with altered expression levels in all of the cell
lines that were resistant to the same cytostatic drug. Thus,
genes that might be related to drug resistance but did not
have altered expression levels in all cases were eliminated
from our study and are not discussed here. The expression
of four genes, ABCC6, BST2, ERAP2 and MCTP1, was
downregulated in the CisPt-resistant cell lines.
ABCC6 is drug transporter from the ABC family
that transports glutathione S-conjugated leukotriene. The
role of ABCC6 in drug resistance is not well established.
Increased expression of ABCC6 has been reported to
impart a low level of resistance to etoposide, teniposide,
doxorubicin, and daunorubicin [31]. The role of ABCC6
in CisPt resistance has not been reported. Nonetheless,
the level of this drug transporter is suspected to be

increased rather than decreased in drug-resistant cell
lines.
Bone-marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2), also known
as a tetherin, is a protein that is associated with lipid rafts
and is expressed mainly on B cells [32]. Expression of
the BST2 gene was upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 human breast-cancer cells [33], human mammary
xenografts resistant to tamoxifen [34] and in breast cancer
patients with bone-marrow metastases [35]. However, the
role of this gene in cytostatic-drug resistance is currently
unknown. We observed downregulated expression of this
gene in all of CisPt-resistant cell lines, with very strong
downregulation in the A2780CR1 cell line and strong
downregulation in the A2780DR2 cell line. However, the
expression level of this gene in the W1TR cell line was
increased. Downregulated expression of this gene in all of
the CisPt-resistant cell lines suggested that it might be a
marker of CisPt resistance.
ERAP2 (endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2)
plays a central role in peptide trimming, a process required
for the generation of most HLA class I-binding peptides
[36]. To date, this protein has not been reported to play
a role in cytostatic-drug resistance. However, it has been
reported that the inhibition of ER-peptide trimming play
a key role in stimulating innate and adaptive anti-tumour
immune responses [37]. We observed downregulated
ERAP2 expression in the CisPt-resistant cell lines,
which suggested that CisPt-resistant cells might be more
susceptible to immune-response components than other
cells.
The expression of the MCTP1 (multiple C2 domains,
transmembrane 1) gene was strongly downregulated in all
of the CisPt-, Pac- and Top-resistant cell lines, as well as
in one of the Dox-resistant cell line. This result suggested

that downregulation of MCTP1 expression might be an
unspecific response of cancer cells to cytostatic-drug
treatment. This protein is poorly described in the literature.
C2 domains are primarily found in signal-transduction
proteins and membrane-trafficking proteins. In both of
these types of proteins, the C2 domains are responsible
for regulating their functions through Ca2+ binding [38].
The second drug used in first line ovarian-cancer
chemotherapy is Pac. Resistance to this drug is mainly
related to the MDR phenotype of cancer cells and to
the level of MDR1 (ABCB1) expression. We previously
reported increased expression of the ABCB1 gene in Pacand Dox-resistant cell lines and discussed the implications
of this finding [39, 40].

A new gene that was found to be expressed in
the Pac-resistant cell lines is EPHA7. The EPHA7
(EPH receptor A7) gene encodes the ephrin receptor,
which belongs to the protein-tyrosine kinase family
and functions as receptor-tyrosine kinase that binds
ephrin-A-family ligands. The ligand of this receptor
is EFNA5. Forward signalling via EPH receptor A7
may result in the activation of components of the ERK
signalling pathway [41]. To our knowledge it is the first
time where elevated expression of EPHA7 is observed
in ovarian cancer patients. However expression of
EPHA7 was observed in other cancers. The expression
of EPHA7 is downregulated in colorectal cancer [42]
and upregulated in prostate [43] and lung cancer [44].

In gallbladder adenocarcinoma, the expression level of
EPHA7 was an independent poor-prognostic predictor,
and the elevated expression of EPHA7 was closely
related to carcinogenesis, disease progression and a poor
prognosis [45]. In hepatocellular carcinoma, a high level
of expression of EPHA7 protein may play an important
role in malignant transformation and tumour progression,
invasion and metastasis [46]. In summary, elevated
expression of EPHA7 is a poor prognostic factor for
many cancers and is correlated with cancer progression
and metastasis. To our knowledge, this study is the first
to show that EPHA7 might play a role in Pac resistance
and development of ovarian cancer.
The RUNDC3B (RPIP9 - Rap2-Interacting Protein
9) gene encodes a poorly characterized protein that
interacts with Rap2 and belongs to the Ras superfamily
of GTPases. It was reported that RPIP9 was activated
in a high proportion of breast carcinomas and that
this occurrence was significantly correlated with their
metastasis to lymph nodes. Interestingly, the sequences of
the RPIP9 and MDR1 genes overlap on chromosome 7
[47]. It is possible that RPIP9 is expressed in Pac-resistant
cell lines due to the activation of MDR1 in these cells.
Similarly, RPIP9 was also expressed in two of the three
Dox-resistant cell lines that also expressed MDR1. It is
also possible that by interacting with RAP2, RPIP9 plays
a role in signal transduction leading to a more invasive and
drug-resistant phenotype.
Downregulation of the expression of certain genes is
related to specific cellular phenotypes. In the Pac-resistant
cell lines, we observed downregulated expression of the
LIPG gene. LIPG is an endothelial lipase that is involved
in the hydrolysis of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) [48].
We did not found any data in the literature concerning the
expression of LIPG in drug-resistant cancers or cancer
cell lines. It is possible that Pac treatment led to the
downregulation of LIPG expression.
Another gene with downregulated expression in
three Pac-resistant cell lines was NSBP1, which encodes
a chromatin- and nucleosome-binding protein that
preferentially binds to and unfolds euchromatin via a
Nucleosome Binding Domain (NBD) and thus modulates
transcription [49]. This protein has been reported to induce
the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells [50].
This gene was observed to be overexpressed in squamous
cell carcinoma [51] and prostate cancer [52] in humans,
as well as in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435HM
breast cancer cell line [53]. The elevated expression of
NSBP1 in this cell line suggests that it plays a role in
tumourigenesis. In contrast, in this study, we observed
downregulated expression of this gene in Pac-resistant cell
lines, suggesting that they present less metastatic potential
than parental cell lines.
PCDH9 (protocadherin 9) is a transmembrane
protein containing cadherin domains that is most likely
involved in calcium dependent cell adhesion and is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

involved in signalling at neuronal synaptic junctions
[54]. PCDH9 has been reported to be a tumoursuppressor gene in human gliomas. The loss of PCDH9
expression was associated with a higher histological
grade of tumour and significantly shorter survival times
[55]. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, the loss
of PCDH9 expression facilitated tumour-cell migration
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [56]. Thus,
the expression of PCDH9 is downregulated in tumours
and the loss of its expression can be related to a more
invasive phenotype.
The expression of the PTPRK (Protein
tyrosine-phosphatase, receptor-type kappa) gene was
downregulated in all of the Pac- and Top-resistant cell
lines, as well as in two CisPt-resistant cell lines, with very
strong downregulation observed in the A2780PR2 and
A2780CR2 cell lines (by more than 50-fold). The PTPRK
gene is located in a putative tumour-suppressor region
of the human genome, on the long arm of chromosome
6 [57]. This gene was one of the most downregulated
observed in our study, suggesting its significant role in
the development of cytostatic-drug resistance. It has been
reported that PTPRK expression is downregulated in many
cancer types and cancer-cell lines including, melanoma
[58], lung cancer [59], prostate cancer [60] and breast
cancer [61]. Breast cancer patients with decreased PTPRK
transcript levels have shorter survival times and a higher
probability of metastases [61]. The role of this gene in
ovarian cancer was not reported. Our results suggest that
its reduced expression is associated with the development
of drug resistance in ovarian cancer. The loss of active
PTPRK in gliomas was associated with a higher level of
resistance to chemotherapy and reconstitution of wildtype PTPRK in malignant glioma-cell lines improved the
effect of conventional therapeutics [62]. Decreased levels
of PTPRK expression or the loss of PTPRK activity due
to mutation led to increased tyrosine-phosphorylationbased signalling, which is a major driving force in the
development and progression of tumours. Thus, the
decreased PTPRK expression in our cell lines might lead
to increase the expression levels of genes involved in drug
resistance.
SEMA3A (collapsin-1) is a secreted protein that is
a member of semaphorin family. Normally, this protein
activates signal transduction in neuronal cells through its
receptor NP1/PlexA [63]. We observed the SEMA3A gene
downergulation in the Pac-resistant cell lines, with more
than 60-fold downregulation found in the W1PR cell line.
These results are consistent with the results of another
study. Downregulated SEMA3A expression was also
observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [64]. It
was suggested that lower levels of SEMA3A may promote
pleural and vascular invasion and lymph-node metastasis.
Decreased expression of SEMA3A in gastric carcinomas
was associated with poor differentiation and with invasion
and metastasis [65].

The expression of ABCB1 and ABCB4 in Doxresistant cell lines was associated with the MDR
phenotype, as we previously reported [20, 21, 39, 40].
The expression level of the IFI16 (interferon,
gamma-inducible protein 16) gene was increased in the
Dox-resistant cell lines and in the A2780PR1 cell line,
which was resistant to Pac. We observed a greater than
four-hundred-fold increase in the expression level of
this gene in the A2780PR1 cell line, suggesting its role
in resistance to cytostatic drugs. IFI16 interacts with p53
and retinoblastoma protein and inhibits cellular growth via
the Ras/Raf signalling pathway [66]. Contradictory data
regarding the role of IFI16 in cancer has been reported
in the literature. It has been reported that most breastcancer cell lines have a decreased level of IFI16 mRNA
compared with that in normal epithelial cells [67]. Similar
observations were made regarding prostate cancer [68].
The authors suggested that the loss of IFI16 expression
contributed to the development of breast or prostate
cancer. In contrast, in ovarian cancer cells, IFI16 appeared
to be involved in drug resistance. The expression levels of
genes in primary epithelial ovarian cancer tissues that were
sensitive or resistant to chemotherapeutics were compared.
One of genes that was overexpressed in drug-resistant
tissues was IFI16 [69]. Our results also indicate that
protein expression of IFI16 could differ in histologically
different types of ovarian cancer. This finding is consistent
with our cell culture results showing the overexpression of
IFI16 in drug-resistant cell lines. Thus, the role of IFI16 in
cancers may be cancer-type specific; however, in ovarian
cancer cells, its overexpression appears to be related to the
drug-resistant phenotype.
Top, a topoisomerase I-poison is a cytostatic drug
used in the second-line chemotherapy of ovarian cancer.
The main mechanism underlying Top resistance includes

its efflux by the drug transporter ABCG2 and mutations
in DNA topoisomerase I [28]. We previously reported
increased expression of ABCG2 in the investigated cell
lines and discussed the implications [20, 39, 40]. However,
in this study we observed the increased expression of
eight additional genes that appeared to be related to Top
resistance.
HERC5 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase [70] that
is a positive regulator of the innate antiviral response in
cells treated using interferon [71]. It has been reported that
the level of HERC5 is a prognostic marker in lung cancer
[72]; however, its role in drug resistance is unknown.
Three other genes, IFIH1, MYOT and SAMD4A,
that were found to be overexpressed in the Top-resistant
cell lines were not previously reported to be related to drug
resistance or even to any cancer. The IFIH1 gene encodes
the MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein
5) protein, which recognizes dsRNA and participates in
the antiviral response [73]. The MYOT gene encodes
myotylin, a skeletal muscle protein that is found within
the Z-discs of sarcomeres and is involved in the regulation
of myofibril assembly and stability [74]. In human tissues,
myotylin expression is largely restricted to striated
muscles and nerves. SAMD4A (Sterile Alpha Motif
Domain Containing 4A) is a translational repressor of
genes encoding SRE-containing messenger proteins [75].
In the study, we showed that these genes are expressed in
all of the Top-resistant cell lines. This finding suggested
that IFIH1, MYOT and SAMD4A are involved in the
resistance to this drug.
S100A3 is a calcium binding protein of unknown
function. Other members of the S100 proteins family are
involved in regulating cell-cycle and cell differentiation
[76]. The expression level of S100A3 was increased in
human colorectal cancer cells compared that in normal

control cells [77]. In human castration-resistant prostate
cancers, the expression level of S100A3 was increased
and inhibiting its expression resulted in the suppression
of tumour growth [78]. These data suggest that our Topresistant cell lines might have an increased tumorigenic
potential compared with the parental cell line.
SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), also known as
osteopontin (OPN), is a secreted protein that is expressed
in bone tissue [79]. Its expression has also been reported in
many cancers including ovarian cancer [80] and it appears
to be involved in drug resistance and in the progression
and metastasis of tumours [81]. Our results confirm
expression of OPN in ovarian cancer and suggest its role in
Top-resistance. The role of OPN in the resistance to CisPt
[82, 83] and to P-gp substrates [83, 84], has been reported.
In a very elegant study, Das and coworkers [83] showed
that OPN treatment increased the levels of resistance
to CisPt, Dox and Pac and induced the expression of
ABCB1 and ABCG2. In the present study, we observe
the overexpression of OPN in all of the Top-resistant cell
lines. All of these cell lines also expressed ABCG2 at a
very high level. Thus, OPN appeared to induce ABCG2
expression in the Top-resistant cell lines and by doing so,
may be responsible for Top resistance. In similar manner,
OPN expression might also be responsible for the P-gp
expression and Dox and Pac resistance in our cell lines.
OPN overexpression might induce CisPt resistance in
the A2780CR2 cell line via a different mechanism. In
small-cell lung cancer, OPN induced CisPt resistance by
blocking caspase-9- and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis
[82]. In summary, OPN appeared to be involved in drug
resistance mainly through stimulating ABC-transporter
expression.
We previously reported that TGFBI (transforming
growth factor-beta-induced protein) was expressed in
Top-resistant cell lines in the context of the expression of
extracellular matrix (ECM) components [85, 86]. In this
study TGFBI expression appeared to be a marker of Top
resistance. To our knowledge, the role of this protein in
Top resistance is unknown. However, we found much data
concerning the expression of TGFBI in ovarian cancer and
in Pac-resistant cells. Nearly all of the reports indicated
that the expression level of TGFBI in ovarian cancers
[87] and ovarian cancer cell lines [88] was decreased via
promoter methylation. Furthermore, decreased levels of
TGFBI expression have been correlated with resistance
to Pac [88, 89]. However, the results of other studies
indicated that TGFBI promoted the metastatic potential of
ovarian cancer cells by promoting their motility, invasion,
and adhesion to peritoneal cells [90] and that overall
survival (OS) was significantly shorter in serous-epithelial
ovarian cancer patients whose tumours expressed TGFBI
[91]. Our results also indicate that TGFBI is expressed in
ovarian cancer patients. In view of these conflicting data, it
is difficult to explain the role of TGFBI in ovarian cancer.
However, because TGFBI was expressed in all of the Topwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, its expression might be
a marker of Top-resistance in ovarian cancer.

Cell lines and cell culture
In this study, we used two ovarian cancer cell lines,
the established ovarian cancer A2780 cell line and the
primary ovarian cancer W1 cell line.
The human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cell line was
purchased from ATCC. A2780 sublines that were resistant
to CisPt [A2780CR1 and A2780CR2 (A2780 cisplatin
resistant)], Pac [A2780PR1 and A2780PR2 (A2780
paclitaxel resistant)], Dox [A2780DR1 and A2780DR2
(A2780 doxorubicin resistant)] and Top [A2780TR1
and A2780TR2 (A2780 topotecan resistant)] were
generated by exposing A2780 cells to the relevant drugs
at incrementally increased concentrations.
The human ovarian cancer W1 cell line was
established using ovarian cancer tissue obtained from an
untreated patient. W1 sublines resistant to CisPt [W1CR
(W1 cisplatin resistant)], Dox [W1DR (W1 doxorubicin
resistant)], Top [W1TR (W1 topotecan resistant)] and
Pac [W1PR (W1 paclitaxel resistant)] were obtained by
exposing W1 cells to the drugs at incrementally increased
concentrations.
All resistant cell lines were generated in our
laboratory. The cells were seed in the concentration of
10 thousand cells/cm2 in 25 cm2 flask in dedicated media
supplemented with appropriate drug. The established
concentrations of the initial drugs exposure were of: CisPt
20 ng/mL, Dox 10 ng/mL, Top 0,5 ng/mL, and Pac 1 ng/
mL. Each cell line was exposed three times for 3-day
periods during a 3–6-week period allowing for growth
recovery between cycles. The drug dose was doubled

after the completion of three cycles and the procedure was
repeated until the final drug levels were achieved.
The final concentrations used for selection were
1000 ng/ml Cis, 1100 ng/ml Pac, 100 ng/ml Dox, and 24
ng/ml Top. These concentrations were chosen based on the
results of Dietel et al., 1997 [29] and were two-fold higher
than the plasma concentrations of the respective drugs 2
hours after intravenous administration.
All of the cell lines were maintained as monolayers
in complete medium [MEM medium (A2780) or RPMI1640 (W1) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine
serum, 2 pM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml),
streptomycin (100 units/ml) and amphotericin B (25 μg/
ml)] at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Quality control (QC) studies were performed using
Affymetrix GeneAtlas™ (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) software, according to the manufacturer’s standards.
Secondary quality control studies were performed using
Partek® Express™ Software (Partek, Inc., Chesterfield,
MO, USA). Gene-screening analysis of the QC-based
results and statistical analysis (non-parametric MannWhitney test using α=0.05) were performed using the
same software. As a result, a table showing the most
significant fold changes in the levels of gene expression of
the resistant cells relative to those of the parental cells was
developed, after which it was imported into the Pathway
Studio® Explore platform (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville,
MD, USA), in which pathway studies was performed. The
genes with greatest fold changes in expression between the
drug-resistant and parental cell lines were listed.
To visualize the effect of filtering the data, we
applied the gene list to volcano plotting using a fivefold change in the expression level as the threshold
(genes with expression upregulated more than 5-fold and
downregulated -5-fold) (Figure 4). threshold was applied
in preparing the gene table and in final analytical step, the
genes related to cytostatic drug-resistance were selected.
The volcano plots and the list of genes were created
using the R language-based (http://www.r-project.org,
version 2.14) Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.
org) package.

RNA isolation and preparation of microarray an
RQ-PCR reactions
The RNA was isolated from the A2780, W1 cells and
all of the resistant cells using TRIzol reagent, according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA was quantified
using spectrophotometry by measuring the absorbance
values at 260 nm and 280 nm, and the 260/280 nm ratio
was used to estimate the level of protein contamination.
The 260/280 nm ratios of the samples ranged from 1.8 to
2.0. The extent of RNA degradation was evaluated using
an electrophoretic method employing a 1% denaturing
agarose gel and by estimating the RIN factor using a
Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). RIN values ranged from 8.5 to 10,
with an average value of 9.2. Additionally, each sample
was diluted to a final working concentration of 100 ng/μl.
All of the samples were prepared in triplicate. The cDNA
for the microarray analysis was synthetized in two steps
(separate synthesis for first and second strand) using an
Affymetrix GeneChip® 3’ ’IVT Express Kit and 100 ng/
μl of RNA, according to the Affymetrix GeneAtlas 3’
IVT Express Kit protocol. The next steps, which were in
vitro transcription (resulting in cRNA populations), biotin
labelling, and cRNA fragmentation were performed using
the same protocol.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed
on transverse 5 μm formalin-fixed and paraffin
embedded sections from human ovarian carcinoma
placed on the SuperFrost/Plus microscope slides. We
have investigated tissues from patients with ovarian
serous adenocarcinoma and ovarian endometrioid
adenocarcinoma. The analysis of EPHA7, IFI16, SPP1 and
TGFBI expression was performed by use of the polymerbased immunohistochemical (IHC) technique [30] The
primary antibodies used as follows: EPHA7 (1:300,
mouse monoclonal anti-EPHA7 antibody, Abnova, Taipei,
Taiwan), IFI16 (1:200, mouse monoclonal anti-IFI16
antibody, Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan), SPP1 (1:100, rabbit
polyclonal anti-SPP1 antibody, Proteintech, Chicago,
USA), TGFBI (1:100, rabbit polyclonal anti-TGFBI
antibody, Atlas Antibodies, Bromma, Sweden).
The slides were dewaxed with xylene, and gradually
hydrated. Activity of endogenous peroxidase was blocked
by 30 minute exposure to 1% H2O2. The sections were
incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight
at 4°C and followed by incubation with EnVision
Detection System Peroxidase/DAB, Rabbit/Mouse for 30
minutes (Dako REALTMEnVisionTM Detection System

Microarray hybridization and scanning
The samples were loaded onto and hybridized
to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U219
microarrays, together with control cRNA and oligo B2.
Hybridization was conducted at 45°C for 16 hours. using
an AccuBlock™ Digital Dry Bath (Labnet International,
Inc. NY, USA) hybridization oven Next, the microarrays
were washed and stained according to manufacturer’s
protocol using an Affymetrix GeneAtlas™ Fluidics
Station (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and the chips
were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneAtlas™ Imaging
Station (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The scans of
the microarrays were saved as *.CEL files on hard disks.

hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted.
Histological slides with protein expression were
examined under an optical Olympus BH-2 microscope
coupled to a digital camera. Color microscope images
were recorded using LUCIA Image 5.0 computer software
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
The expression of given markers (only clearly
labelled cells with cytoplasmic/nuclear signal were
considered), was calculated taking into account the
mean proportion of immunopositive cancer cells among
all cancer cells counted in 10 light microscope fields
each at magnification of 400x (at least 100 cancer cells
per one microscopic field). Expression was evaluated
using the semi-quantitative scale in which the score of 0
(negative) corresponded to no staining observed or less
than 10% of cancer cells weakly positive; score 1 (weak)
corresponded to 11% to 50% positive cancer cells; the
score 2 (moderate) corresponded to 51% to 75% positive
cancer cells; score 3 (strong) corresponded to up to 75%
positive cancer cells.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the alteration of the expression
levels of many genes was observed in ovarian cancer
cells in response to treatment with first- and second-line
chemotherapeutic cytostatic drugs. Approximately half of
these genes were not previously associated with any cancer
including ovarian cancer and and not described in term of
cytostatic-drug resistance. Changes in expression levels
of these genes in three ovarian cancer cell lines that were
resistant to the same cytostatic drug indicated that these
changes might be specific markers of deleterious cellular
responses to chemotherapy. Expression of selected genes
was confirmed at protein level in ovarian cancer patients.
Thus, up/downregulation of the expression of these genes
pre- versus post-chemotherapy could be predictive in term
of the response to treatment. For confirmation of these
hypotheses, gene-expression studies should be conducted
using an animal model of ovarian cancer and using
samples of primary and metastatic tumours taken from
ovarian cancer patients before and after chemotherapy is
administered.
