Abstract
Recepteur d’origine nantais (RON) is a receptor tyrosine
kinase closely related to c-Met. Both receptors are involved
in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and there is
evidence that both are deregulated in cancer. Receptor overexpression has been most frequently described, but other
mechanisms can lead to the oncogenic activation of RON and
c-Met. They include activating mutations or gene amplification for c-Met and constitutively active splicing variants for
RON. We identified a novel inhibitor of RON and c-Met,
compound I, and characterized its in vitro and in vivo
activities. Compound I selectively and potently inhibited the
kinase activity of RON and c-Met with IC50s of 9 and 4 nmol/L,
respectively. Compound I inhibited hepatocyte growth factor–
mediated and macrophage-stimulating protein–mediated
signaling and cell migration in a dose-dependent manner.
Compound I was tested in vivo in xenograft models that either
were dependent on c-Met or expressed a constitutively active
form of RON (RON#160 in HT-29). Compound I caused
complete tumor growth inhibition in NIH3T3 TPR-Met and
U-87 MG xenografts but showed only partial inhibition in
HT-29 xenografts. The effect of compound I in HT-29 xenografts is consistent with the expression of the activating b-Raf
V600E mutation, which activates the mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathway downstream of RON. Importantly,
tumor growth inhibition correlated with the inhibition of
c-Met–dependent and RON-dependent signaling in tumors.
Taken together, our results suggest that a small-molecule dual
inhibitor of RON/c-Met has the potential to inhibit tumor
growth and could therefore be useful for the treatment of
patients with cancers where RON and/or c-Met are activated.

Introduction
Recepteur d’origine nantais (RON) is a receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) normally expressed at low levels mostly on epithelial cells
(1, 2). It is closely related to c-Met in terms of homology and function (3). Both RON and c-Met are activated in response to their

respective ligand: macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) for RON
(4, 5) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for c-Met (6). The two
RTKs induce an invasive program (7) consisting of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, all of which are important at
multiple points during tumorigenesis. RON and c-Met elicit these
functions through a unique docking site located at their COOH
terminus (8). On receptor activation, two tyrosine residues at the
COOH terminus become phosphorylated and form a multifunctional docking site for SH2 domain-containing adaptor proteins.
This event subsequently triggers a complex signaling cascade that
includes activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and results in
the characteristic functional responses associated with RON and
c-Met (9, 10). The oncogenic potential of RON and c-Met has been
shown in vitro as well as in transgenic animals (11–19).
Oncogene addiction (20) refers to the dependence of tumor cell
survival on an activated oncogene, such as BCR-ABL, in chronic
myelogenous leukemia. This concept suggests that inhibition of the
activated oncogene is sufficient to obtain a clinical response. This
has now been proven in the clinic with several kinase inhibitors,
such as imatinib (21) and gefitinib (22). In the case of kinases,
oncogene addiction may stem from constitutive activity that can
arise as a result of gene translocation, mutation, or amplification
(23–26).
c-Met and RON can be constitutively activated through ligandindependent mechanisms in tumor cells. Constitutively activated
c-Met can result from gene amplification or activating mutations.
The ‘‘oncogene addiction’’ to c-Met is exemplified by the recent
identification of a subset of gastric cancer cell lines harboring MET
gene amplification (26). These cells are dependent on c-Met for
growth and survival and are sensitive to a c-Met inhibitor. Unlike
c-Met, RON-activating mutations or gene amplification has not
been described. Instead, constitutively active RON variants generated by alternative splicing (ROND165, ROND160, and ROND155)
or by methylation-dependent promoter usage [short form RON
(sfRON)] have been identified (14, 27, 28). Cells expressing these
RON proteins show greater scatter activity, focus formation,
anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation in nude
mice compared with cells expressing wild-type RON (14, 27, 28).
Among these RON variants, ROND160 is located at the plasma
membrane, whereas ROND165 and ROND155 are retained in the
cytoplasm. sfRON lacks almost all of the extracellular domain and
is incapable of ligand binding. These variants have been detected in
primary colon cancers and established colon cancer cell lines as
well as in gastric and lung cancer cell lines. Whether cancer cells
are addicted to the activated RON kinases, including ROND160,
is currently unknown.

Novel RON/c-Met Inhibitor

Recently, a monoclonal antibody against RON was described and
shown to partially inhibit tumor growth in several tumor xenograft
models (29, 30). The exact mechanism by which this antibody
inhibits tumor growth has not been shown, but it may act by
blocking MSP-mediated RON activation. In the case of tumors
where RON is activated in a ligand-independent manner, an
antibody against RON would presumably not be effective. However,
a small-molecule kinase inhibitor should have broader application
in RON-driven cancers.
In this article, we characterize a RON/c-Met dual kinase
inhibitor and show that this molecule inhibits both RONdependent and c-Met–dependent signaling and cell migration
in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Together, our data show for the
first time that constitutively activated RON can be targeted by a
small-molecule kinase inhibitor and that targeting both c-Met and
RON could represent a useful strategy to treat patients whose
cancers are dependent on RON and/or c-Met.

Materials and Methods
Compounds. Compound I [IUPAC name: N-(3-fluoro-4-((7-methoxy-4quinolinyl)oxy)phenyl)-1-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)-5-methyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide] was synthesized at Amgen,
Inc. The MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1/2
(MEK1/2) inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Calbiochem.
Cells. KATOIII (gastric), PC3 (prostate), HT-29 (colorectal), Colo205
(colorectal), BxPC3 (pancreatic), and U-87 MG (glioblastoma) cancer cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. NIH3T3
TPR-Met or NIH3T3 RON cells were generated by stable transfection of
TPR-Met, a constitutively active, ligand-independent form of c-Met (31) or
wild-type RON in NIH3T3 cells. Cells were grown as monolayers using
standard cell culture conditions.
Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies against c-Met (C-12), RON (C-20),
and actin (1615-R) were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Antibodies against phospho-c-Met (Y1234/1235), phospho-Gab1 (Y627),
phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), and phospho-AKT (S473) were acquired
from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. The antibody against phosphotyrosine
(clone 4G10) was purchased from Millipore. Recombinant human HGF
was generated by expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified
by heparin sulfate affinity chromatography. MSP and MSP C672A were
acquired from R&D Systems. MSP was used in Western blotting experiments as indicated, whereas MSP C672A was used in the in vitro woundhealing assay because MSP was no longer available commercially.
Kinase assays. IC50 measurements of compound I for c-Met were
measured by homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence as previously
described with minor modification (32). A modified kinase reaction buffer
was used that included 60 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/L NaCl,
20 mmol/L MgCl2, and 5 mmol/L MnCl2. Compound I was tested in a
10-point serial dilution using an ATP concentration of two-third K m value
that was determined for c-Met and calculated using the Eadie-Hofstee
and Lineweaver-Burke methods. The fluorescence ratios were read on a
RubyStar instrument (BMG Labtech, Inc.). To measure the IC50 of compound I for RON, the Invitrogen LanthaScreen procedure was followed
(PV4314; Invitrogen) and the fluorescein-poly-GT substrate was used. The
fluorescence ratios were read on a Tecan Safire II (Tecan).
Western blot analysis. Cells were grown to confluence, serum starved
overnight, and then treated with various concentrations of compound I for
1 h. To investigate the ability of compound I to inhibit ligand-dependent
receptor activation, serum-starved cells were treated with increasing
concentration of compound I for 1 h and then stimulated with recombinant
human HGF for 10 min (250 ng/mL) or MSP for 30 min (800 ng/mL) in the
presence of compound I. These respective concentrations of growth factor
were chosen based on previous dose-response studies indicating that these
concentrations maximally activated their receptor.
Immunoprecipitation. Phosphorylated RON and ROND160 were
immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 RON cells and HT-29 cells, respectively,

from 1 mg of cellular protein per sample using anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10
antibody. RON/ROND160 was subsequently detected with the RON C-20
antibody by Western blotting.
Monolayer scratch assay. NIH3T3 RON and NIH3T3 TPR-Met cells were
seeded in six-well plates and grown until confluent. Cells were serum
starved overnight and then treated with various concentrations of
compound I for 1 h. A gap was introduced with a P200 pipette tip. In the
case of NIH3T3 RON cells, cells were stimulated to migrate across the gap
with 160 ng/mL of MSP C672A alone or MSP C672A and compound I,
whereas NIH3T3 TPR-Met cells were treated with compound I only. After
overnight incubation, the cells were examined by light microscopy and
photographed. Magnifications (40) are shown.
Animals. Female CD1 nu/nu mice ages 6 to 8 wk were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories. Animals were housed in sterilized caging and
received Harlan Teklad sterilized rodent diet and water ad libitum. All of the
procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Amgen
Animal Care and Use Committee. The laboratory housing the animals
met all Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care specifications.
Xenograft studies. NIH3T3 TPR-Met (1  106), U-87 MG (5  106),
HT-29 (2  106 with Matrigel at a ratio of 2:1), or Colo205 (2  106 with
Matrigel) cells were injected s.c. in the right flank of female CD1 nu/nu mice
(n = 10 per group). Compound I treatment began either 1 d after tumor
implantation or when tumors were established (f200 mm3). Compound I
was formulated in 2% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 1% Tween 80 in water
(pH 2.2 adjusted with HCl). Mice were dosed by oral gavage either once or
twice daily. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly with a Pro-Max
Fowler Digital Ultra Caliper (Fred Fowler Co., Inc.) as length (mm)  width
(mm)  height (mm) and expressed as cubic millimeters. Data are
expressed as mean F SE for each group and plotted as a function of time.
The statistical significance of observed differences between growth curves
was evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA followed by Scheffe post hoc
test. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect in tumors, mice bearing
established (f300–400 mm3) NIH3T3 TPR-Met or HT-29 xenograft tumors
were treated with a single dose of compound I at 100 mg/kg. Tumors were
harvested (n = 3 per time point) at the indicated times after treatment and
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Western blot analysis was performed

Figure 2. Compound I inhibits c-Met–mediated signaling and function. A, HT-29 and BxPC3 cells were treated with compound I for 1 h followed by stimulation with

to determine the effect of treatment on the phosphorylation of c-Met and
Gab1, an adaptor protein immediately downstream of c-Met, or ERK1/2,
which is downstream of RON.
Pharmacokinetics. Mouse plasma samples (20 AL) were extracted by
using protein precipitation to isolate compound I and internal standard.
Extracted samples were separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a Varian Pursuit C18 analytic column (30  2.0 mm, 5 Am). The
reagents were water with 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase A) and
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase B). Gradient at a flow
rate of 0.6 mL/min was used, with a total run time of 2 min. Compound I
concentrations were determined in mouse samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using ion atmospheric pressure ionization with multiple reaction monitoring in the positive ion mode. Peak areas
were integrated by the Sciex program Analyst, version 1.4.1. The data
were then exported to the software package Small Molecules Discovery
Assay Watson (version 6.4.0.02, Thermo Electron Corp.) where concentrations were determined by a weighted (1/2) linear regression of peak area
ratios (peak area of compound I/peak area of internal standard) versus
the theoretical concentrations of the calibration standards. Overall
precision and accuracy for the calibration standards and QC samples were
determined by Small Molecules Discovery Assay Watson.

assays showed that compound I is a potent inhibitor of human
RON and c-Met with IC50s of 9 and 4 nmol/L, respectively. To
determine its selectivity profile, compound I was tested against
a panel of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Compound I
had weak inhibitory activity on Lck, Tie2, Src, and BTK with
IC50s ranging from 160 to 710 nmol/L (Fig. 1B) and had IC50s of
>1 Amol/L on all other kinases tested (>20 kinases; Fig. 1B; data
not shown). These data suggest that compound I is a selective
inhibitor of RON and c-Met.
Compound I inhibits c-Met–mediated signaling and functional activity. To confirm its activity on c-Met, compound I was
evaluated for its ability to inhibit HGF-mediated c-Met phosphorylation and downstream signaling. HT-29 and BxPC3 cells were
used throughout these studies because they both express c-Met
and RON (Fig. 4A). In both cell lines, exogenous HGF stimulated
c-Met phosphorylation and downstream signaling as evidenced
by the phosphorylation of Gab1, ERK1/2, and AKT (Fig. 2A).
Compound I inhibited HGF-mediated c-Met phosphorylation and
downstream signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore,
compound I inhibited c-Met phosphorylation with similar potency
in both cell lines (Fig. 2A).
c-Met is known to mediate cell migration (33). To confirm that
compound I can inhibit c-Met function, we tested the ability of
compound I to inhibit migration using an in vitro monolayer

scratch assay. We used NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the ligandindependent, constitutive form of c-Met, TPR-Met (NIH3T3 TPRMet), as a model. As shown in Fig. 2B, compound I inhibited
NIH3T3 TPR-Met cell migration in a dose-dependent manner.
There was a close correlation between the concentrations of
compound I required to inhibit cell migration and those required
to block c-Met phosphorylation in HT-29, BxPC3 (Fig. 2A), and
NIH3T3 TPR-Met cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the inhibitory
effect was mediated by inhibition of the constitutively active TPRMet. Compound I also inhibited the proliferation of NIH3T3 TPRMet cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Collectively, these data show
that compound I inhibits c-Met–mediated signaling and function.
Compound I inhibits RON-mediated signaling and functional
activity. Because compound I also inhibits RON kinase activity, we
evaluated its ability to block MSP-mediated signaling. Because none
of the commercially available antibodies to phospho-RON recognized the appropriate molecular weight band by Western blotting
(data not shown), we performed immunoprecipitation to test the
effect of compound I on MSP-induced RON phosphorylation in
NIH3T3 RON or BxPC3 cells. Phospho-RON was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of cells treated with MSP and/or compound I
using the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody. RON was then
detected by Western blotting using an antibody against the COOH
terminus of the receptor. We found that compound I inhibited
RON phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines
(Fig. 3A and B, top). We then tested the effect of MSP and/or
compound I on downstream signaling, including the phosphorylation of Gab1, ERK1/2, and AKT, in NIH3T3 RON cells or in BxPC3.

Treatment with exogenous MSP resulted in robust phosphorylation
of Gab1, AKT, and ERK1/2 in NIH3T3 RON cells (Fig. 3A), whereas
MSP treatment resulted in weaker phosphorylation of Gab1 and
had little effect on AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BxPC3
cells (Fig. 3B). Because the only known receptor for MSP is RON,
it is reasonable to conclude that the activation of Gab1, AKT, and
ERK1/2 is mediated by RON. Compound I inhibited MSP-induced
phosphorylation of Gab1, ERK1/2, and AKT in a dose-dependent
manner in NIH3T3 RON cells (Fig. 3A) and MSP-mediated
phosphorylation of Gab1 in BxPC3 cells (Fig. 3B). Compared
with HGF/c-Met signaling (Fig. 2A), MSP/RON signaling is weak in
BxPC3 cells and has a minor effect on ERK1/2 and AKT
phosphorylation (Fig. 3B).
Like c-Met, RON has been implicated in the migration and
invasion of epithelial cells (7). To further validate that compound I
specifically inhibits RON function, we used the scratch assay in
NIH3T3 RON cells. We showed that MSP, but not HGF, significantly
induced NIH3T3 RON cell migration (Fig. 3C), and compound I
inhibited this MSP-induced migration in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3D). Moreover, the close correlation of a dose response for
inhibiting MSP-induced RON signaling and the inhibitory effect of
compound I on cell migration suggest that compound I inhibited
NIH3T3 RON cell migration by blocking RON signaling.
HT-29 cells express a constitutive form of RON that signals
via the MAPK pathway. Both c-Met and RON are implicated in
tumorigenesis; however, the two receptors seem to use different
mechanisms for constitutive signaling: amplification and activating mutations for c-Met and alternative splicing for RON (9, 34).

Figure 3. Compound I inhibits RON-mediated signaling and function. NIH3T3 RON (A) and BxPC3 (B) cells were treated with compound I followed by stimulation
with MSP. The effects of compound I were analyzed by Western blotting. In A and B, phospho-RON was detected with the RON C-20 antibody as a single band
of 150 kDa after immunoprecipitation with the 4G10 antibody. Total RON expression was used as a loading control [the RON C-20 antibody detects pro-RON (170 kDa)
and the mature h-chain of RON (150 kDa)]. All other antibodies used in A and B detect a single band of the expected size. C, in vitro wound-healing assay in

Figure 4. HT-29 cells express a constitutively active form of RON. A, RON and c-Met expression pattern in various cell lines. Wild-type pro-RON (170 kDa)
and the mature RON h-chain (150 kDa) are expressed in BxPC3 and Colo205 cells, a truncated RON protein of 140 kDa (ROND160 h-chain) and its precursor
(Pro-ROND160, 160 kDa) are expressed in HT-29 cells, and a single-chain RON protein of 165 kDa (ROND165) is present in KATOIII cells. U-87 MG and NIH3T3
TPR-Met cells did not express detectable levels of RON protein. Wild-type c-Met protein (170 kDa precursor and 145 kDa mature h-chain) is expressed in KATOIII,
HT-29, BxPC3, Colo205, and U-87 MG cells. TPR-Met is a 65-kDa protein. B, HT-29 and BxPC3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MSP to fully
activate RON. Phospho-RON was detected as described in the legend of Fig. 3. C, HT-29 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of compound I (top ) or the
MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (bottom ). The effects of treatment were determined by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting for phospho-RON and Western blotting for all
other proteins. D, same as C (top ), except in BxPC3 cells. In contrast with its effect in HT-29 cells, compound I had no effect on the levels of phospho-ERK1/2 in
BxPC3 cells.

We hypothesized that cancer cells with constitutive c-Met or RON
activity may be addicted to these pathways. To test this, we used
HT-29 cells that have been shown to express a constitutive form of
RON (ROND160; ref. 35). We first profiled several cancer cell lines to
confirm their c-Met and RON expression. We detected a wild-type
pro-RON (170 kDa) and a mature RON h-chain (150 kDa) in BxPC3
and Colo205 cells, whereas we detected a truncated RON protein
at 140 kDa (ROND160 h-chain) and its precursor (Pro-ROND160,
160 kDa) in HT-29 cells as previously documented (Fig. 4A).
We observed a single-chain RON protein of 165 kDa (ROND165) in
the gastric cancer cell line KATOIII (28). U-87 MG and NIH3T3
TPR-Met cells did not express detectable levels of RON protein.
Wild-type c-Met protein (170 kDa precursor and 145 kDa mature
h-chain) was expressed in KATOIII, HT-29, BxPC3, Colo205, and
U-87 MG cells (Fig. 4A). In NIH3T3 TPR-Met cells, the antibody
to c-Met detected a band of 65 kDa as expected.
We decided to test our hypothesis that cancer cells might be
addicted to the activated RON proteins in HT-29 cells because
down-regulation of ROND160 by small interfering RNA in these
cells has previously been shown to have an inhibitory effect on cell
growth, migration, and colony formation (36), suggesting that
ROND160 possesses oncogenic properties. We first tested whether
exogenous MSP could induce RON activity in HT-29 cells. Exogenous MSP only slightly increased the phosphorylation levels of RON
and had little effect on Gab1, ERK1/2, or AKT phosphorylation
levels in HT-29 cells. In contrast, MSP induced RON, Gab1, AKT,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in
BxPC3 cells (Fig. 4B). The effect of MSP in BxPC3 cells is consistent
with previous reports (30, 37). Moreover, these data suggest that
RON is strongly activated in HT-29 cells in the absence of ligand.
HT-29 cells were treated with increasing concentration of compound I. Compound I inhibited RON and Gab1 phosphorylation
in a dose-dependent manner and partially inhibited the phoshoERK1/2 signal in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C, top), suggesting that ROND160 is constitutively active and contributes, at least
partially, to signaling via the MAPK pathway in these cells. In
contrast, basal levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BxPC3
cells were unaffected even at high concentrations of compound I
(Fig. 4D).
The fact that compound I only partially inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HT-29 cells might be explained by the expression of
the activated b-Raf mutation V600E in these cells because this
mutation is a strong inducer of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (38). The
MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, which acts downstream of b-Raf, completely inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HT-29 cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4C, bottom). Together, these results confirm
that HT-29 cells express a constitutive form of RON that contributes
to signaling via the MAPK pathway. HT-29 cells are therefore
probably not entirely dependent on RON, but it is possible that
ROND160 contributes to the oncogenic properties of these cells.
Compound I inhibits the growth of c-Met–dependent and
constitutively active RON-expressing tumors. Although cell line

Novel RON/c-Met Inhibitor

models that depend on c-Met activity have been identified, few,
if any, equivalent models are known for RON. Expression of c-Met,
RON, or even their coexpression does not necessarily confer
dependence on these pathways for tumor growth. Our goal was to
identify models that were dependent on c-Met or expressed a constitutively active form of RON to investigate the in vivo antitumor
activity of compound I.
Compound I was assessed in two c-Met–dependent xenograft
models: U-87 MG and NIH3T3 TPR-Met. Both models are well
documented for their dependence on c-Met activity (39, 40).
Moreover, they both lack RON expression (Fig. 4A), eliminating the
possibility that tumor growth inhibition might be mediated by
blocking RON activity.
Treatment of NIH3T3 TPR-Met tumor-bearing mice once daily
with compound I resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth compared with vehicle-treated control animals (Fig. 5A).
Compound I significantly inhibited tumor growth at doses of 30
or 100 mg/kg once daily or at 30 mg/kg twice daily (P < 0.02).
Furthermore, complete tumor growth inhibition was observed
at a dose of 100 mg/kg once daily. Treatment with compound I
did not adversely affect body weight (data not shown). To confirm
that tumor growth inhibition occurred as a result of inhibition
of c-Met activity, mice bearing established NIH3T3 TPR-Met tumors
were treated with a single dose of compound I at 100 mg/kg.
Tumors were harvested from the mice at different times after
dose and analyzed for TPR-Met and Gab1 phosphorylation. Phos-

phorylation levels of TPR-Met and Gab1 were profoundly reduced
through 12 h and returned to near basal levels by 24 h when
compared with tumors from untreated mice (Fig. 5B). Plasma
levels of compound I in mice from experiments shown in Fig. 5A
and B were evaluated. In both studies, mice treated with 100 mg/kg
had high concentrations of compound I through 12 h but significantly lower concentrations at 24 h (Fig. 5C; data not shown).
These data show that phospho-Gab1 and phospho-Met inhibition
correlates with plasma levels of compound I, and in turn, these
variables also correlate with NIH3T3 TPR-Met tumor growth
inhibition. Compound I had no direct effect on Src phosphorylation
in vivo despite the high concentration achieved in mice (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
To extend the finding that compound I inhibits the growth of
c-Met–dependent tumor models, compound I was tested against
established U-87 MG tumor xenografts. As shown in Fig. 5D,
compound I inhibited the growth of these tumors in a dosedependent manner. Similar to the data in the NIH3T3 TPR-Met
model, compound I significantly inhibited tumor growth at doses
of 100 mg/kg once daily or 30 mg/kg twice daily (P < 0.0001).
We next tested the contribution of ROND160 in HT-29 tumor
growth. When mice bearing established HT-29 tumors were dosed
daily with compound I, a statistically significant, dose-dependent
reduction in tumor growth was observed (P < 0.02; Fig. 6A). Mice
bearing established HT-29 xenografts were also treated with a
single dose of compound I at 100 mg/kg to assess the effect on

Figure 5. Compound I inhibits c-Met–dependent tumor growth in vivo. A, CD1 nu/nu mice bearing NIH3T3 TPR-Met s.c. tumors were treated with compound I
beginning 1 d after tumor implantation. Mice were dosed orally as indicated. B, mice bearing established (f300–400 mm3) NIH3T3 TPR-Met tumors were treated with a
single dose of compound I at 100 mg/kg. Tumors were harvested at the indicated times after treatment and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. c-Met and Gab1
phosphorylation was determined by Western blot analysis. C, plasma samples from A and B were analyzed to determine compound I concentrations at different time
points. In both experiments, mice treated with 100 mg/kg showed similar plasma concentrations at each time point. Plasma concentrations from B are shown (n = 3 per

Discussion

Figure 6. Compound I inhibits the growth of HT-29 tumors that express the
constitutively active ROND160. A, mice bearing established (f200 mm3) HT-29
tumors were treated as indicated. P values denote statistical significance of
observed differences between growth curves compared with the vehicle-treated
group. B, mice bearing established (f400 mm3) HT-29 tumors were treated
with a single dose of compound I. Tumors were harvested at the indicated
times after treatment and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. ERK1/2
phosphorylation was determined by Western blot analysis. C, mice bearing
established (f200 mm3) Colo205 tumors were treated as indicated. No
statistically significant differences between growth curves were observed. Arrow
and Rx, first day of dosing.

ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vivo. ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the
HT-29 xenografts was partially inhibited between 1 and 12 h following a single dose of compound I (Fig. 6B). The partial inhibition
of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vivo correlated with the partial
inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 6A) and with the partial inhibition
of ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed in vitro (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, O’Toole and colleagues (30) had similar findings in HT-29
xenografts using a monoclonal antibody to human RON. Together,
these data suggest that ROND160 contributes to the oncogenic properties of HT-29 cells.
To confirm that compound I does not have a nonspecific antitumor effect, we tested it in Colo205 xenografts that express both
wild-type c-Met and RON (Fig. 4A) but show no signs of constitutive activity from either receptor (data not shown). Moreover,
these cells, like HT-29 cells, express the activated b-Raf mutant
V600E (38). Figure 6C shows that the growth of Colo205 tumors
was unaffected by compound I treatment at doses that significantly
inhibited tumor growth in c-Met–dependent models and in a
model expressing ROND160.

This report describes compound I, a novel dual inhibitor of RON
and c-Met. We showed that compound I exhibits inhibitory effects
on c-Met and RON kinase activity as well as on c-Met–mediated and
RON-mediated signaling and function in cells. Furthermore,
compound I inhibits c-Met–driven and RON-driven tumor growth
in vivo by blocking their respective signaling. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that a small-molecule inhibitor of RON is described.
Our results show that inhibition of RON kinase activity constitutes a
viable approach for an anticancer drug. Furthermore, targeting both
RON and c-Met with a single molecule could benefit a larger patient
population than an inhibitor directed only at RON or c-Met.
Targeted tumor therapy relies on the hypothesis that some cancers are addicted, or at least partially dependent, on specific genetic
or molecular lesions. The discovery that constitutively active forms
of RON and c-Met are present in human cancers provides a strong
rationale for the development of targeted therapies against these
RTKs. Several agents directed at c-Met are currently in early-phase
clinical trials. c-Met has been recognized for some time now as a
potentially important target for an anticancer drug. Indeed, many
tumor types overexpress c-Met and some harbor activating mutations or amplification of the receptor. Recently, MET amplification emerged as an important mechanism of gefitinib resistance in
non–small cell lung cancer cell lines and in tumors from patients
initially responsive to the drug (41). Under these circumstances,
inhibition of c-Met kinase activity restored sensitivity to gefitinib
in vitro. These data provide a clear example where a c-Met kinase
inhibitor would be clinically relevant. It will be interesting to see if
MET amplification will become a common theme in the resistance
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in solid tumors.
The role of RON in human cancer is less well defined. Activating
mutations or amplification has not been observed thus far. On the
other hand, splicing variants of RON with constitutive activity have
been described both in cell lines and in cancer specimens, including colorectal and gastric cancers (14, 27, 28), suggesting that RON
may play a key role in these cancers and may constitute an
important target for intervention. It is presently unclear whether
an antibody against RON would inhibit the constitutive activity
of ROND160. O’Toole and colleagues have observed a partial
inhibition of tumor growth in the HT-29 xenograft model with a
RON neutralizing antibody, which is consistent with our findings.
However, other active variants of RON are located in the cytoplasm
(14) and would be inaccessible to an antibody therapy. For these
reasons, a small-molecule approach to RON seems promising.
Thus far, we have not been able to identify cancer cell line models
where an active cytoplasmic RON contributes to tumor growth.
KATOIII cells express ROND165, but this form of RON does not
have cell-transforming activities (28). A small-molecule inhibitor
of RON will be an important tool to investigate the significance
of the different RON variants in tumorigenesis in vitro and, more
importantly, their potential role in human cancers.
In this study, we used HT-29 as a model where RON might contribute to the oncogenic properties of the cells due to the presence of
the constitutive form of the receptor. We avoided using models
where wild-type RON is expressed because (a) they would rely on
mouse MSP to activate RON in vivo and (b) as seen with the Colo205
xenografts (Fig. 6C), expression of wild-type RON does not necessarily confer dependence on the pathway. In contrast, we confirmed
that the constitutively activated ROND160 contributes to the activation of the MAPK cascade in HT-29 cells and that compound I

Novel RON/c-Met Inhibitor

showed a dose-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
in vitro and in vivo and caused tumor growth inhibition. Whether
human tumors expressing constitutive forms of RON will be addicted
to this pathway will need to be determined in the clinic. It is likely
that some of these tumors will be similar to the HT-29 model where
multiple genetic defects are present. In these cases, a drug combination approach including a RON kinase inhibitor may be warranted.
In conclusion, we described the first RON/c-Met dual kinase
inhibitor and showed that a single molecule might constitute an
interesting strategy to interdict two different oncogenes that use
different mechanisms of activation in human cancers.
