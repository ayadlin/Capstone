ABSTRACT
Current drug therapy fails to reduce lung destruction of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as
an important integrator of signals that control energy balance and lipid metabolism.
However, there are no studies regarding the role of AMPK in reducing inflammatory
responses and cellular senescence during the development of emphysema.
Therefore, we hypothesize that AMPK reduces inflammatroy responses, senescence,
and lung injury. To test this hypothesis, human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B) and small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) were treated with cigarette smoke
extract (CSE) in the presence of a specific AMPK activator (AICAR, 1 mM) and
inhibitor (Compound C, 5 μM). Elastase injection was performed to induce mouse
emphysema, and these mice were treated with a specific AMPK activator metformin
as well as Compound C. AICAR reduced, whereas Compound C increased CSEinduced increase in IL-8 and IL-6 release and expression of genes involved in cellular
senescence. Knockdown of AMPKα1/α2 increased expression of pro-senescent
genes (e.g., p16, p21, and p66shc) in BEAS-2B cells. Prophylactic administration
of an AMPK activator metformin (50 and 250 mg/kg) reduced while Compound C
(4 and 20 mg/kg) aggravated elastase-induced airspace enlargement, inflammatory
responses and cellular senescence in mice. This is in agreement with therapeutic
effect of metformin (50 mg/kg) on airspace enlargement. Furthermore, metformin
prophylactically protected against but Compound C further reduced mitochondrial
proteins SOD2 and SIRT3 in emphysematous lungs. In conclusion, AMPK reduces
abnormal inflammatory responses and cellular senescence, which implicates as a
potential therapeutic target for COPD/emphysema.

INTRODUCTION

and γ. The phosporylation of Thr-172 on the α subunit is
critical for AMPK activation in response to an increase
in AMP concentation. AMPK is an important integrator
of signals that control energy balance and metabolism
[4]. Recent studies have shown that AMPK participates
in regulation of cellular senescence and premature aging
[5, 6]. However, there are no studies regarding the
regulation of AMPK in lung inflammatory responses and
cellular senescence during the development of COPD/
emphysema. Therefore, we hypothesize that AMPK
reduces inflammatroy responses and senescence during
the devlopment of pulmonary emphysema. To test this
hypothesis, we utilized human bronchial epithelial
cells (BEAS-2B) and small airway epithelial cells
(SAECs) treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) as

Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for the
development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). Current drug therapy fails to reduce the
relentless progression of COPD, which may be due to
lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying lung
destructive processes of this disease. Cellular senesence
interacts with microenvironmental inflammation, which
plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of COPD [1– 3].
Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying cellular
senescence and inflammatory responses during the
development of COPD are not well understood.

well as a mouse model of elastase-induced pulmonary
emphysema.

RESULTS

To further extrapolate the in vitro findings into
in vivo animal model, we established a mouse model
of pulmonary emphysema, as described previously
[7]. As shown in Figure 4, a significant increase in
mean linear intercept (Lm) was observed in mice
injected with elastase. Prophylactic administration
of a specific AMPK activator metformin (50 and
250 mg/kg) apparently attenuated elastase-induced
airspace enlargement, with higher efficacy at dose
of 250 mg/kg (Figure 4). In contrast, treatment
with a specific AMPK inhibitor Compound C
(4 and 20 mg/kg) significantly augmented elastase-induced
increase in Lm. Furthermore, we started to administer
metformin (50 mg/kg, daily, 1 week) to mice after
3 weeks of intratracheal elastase instillation. We found
that therapeutic administration of metformin significantly
reduced airspace enlargement (Figure 5). These findings
implicate that AMPK activation is beneficial to intervene
with development of emphysema via prophylactic and
therapeutic actions

Effect of AMPK on inflammatory mediator
release in human lung epithelial cells
Cigarette smoke is known to cause inflammatory
responses, which are important features during the
development of COPD/emphysema. To determine the
role of AMPK in reducing inflammatory responses, both
BEAS-2B and SAEC cells were treated with a specific
AMPK activator (AICAR, 1 mM) or inhibitor (Compound
C, 5 μM) during CSE treatment for 24 hours. As shown
in Figure 1, CSE treatment caused a significant release
of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6 and IL-8 in both
BEAS-2B and SAECs. Treatment with an AMPK activator
AICAR reduced, whereas Compound C increased CSEinduced release in pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6 and
IL-8. These results demonstrate that AMPK attenuates
cigarette smoke-induced inflammatory responses in human
lung epithelial cells.

AMPK reduced the expression of genes involved in
cellular senescence in human lung epithelial cells

AMPK reduced inflammatory responses and
senescence in mice with emphysema

Senescent cells are not quiescent cells, which
show increased inflammatory phenotype in response
to stress. Therefore, we hypothesize that AMPK
ameliorates senescent responses in human lung epithelial
cells exposed to cigarette smoke. As shown in Figure
2, CSE treatment increased the expression of p16, p21
and p66shc but reduced klotho gene expression. AICAR
treatment reduced the expression of p16, p21, and
p66shc, but augmented klotho gene expression in both
BEAS-2B and SAEC cells treated with CSE. In contrast,
Compound C treatment further enhanced CSE-induced
expression of p16, p21, and p66shc, whereas klotho gene
expression was reduced by Compound C in human lung
epithelial cells. These results indicate that AMPK reduces
cigarette smoke-induced senescence in lung epithelial
cells.

To determine whether AMPK modulates
inflammatory responses and cell senescence in vivo, we
first measured the levels of cytokines KC and MCP-1 by
ELISA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of mice with
emphysema. Levels of KC and MCP-1 were significantly
increased in BAL fluid of emphysematous mice as
compared to control saline group (Figure 6). Prophylactic
treatment with metformin attenuated, whereas Compound
C administration further increased the levels of KC and
MCP-1 in BAL fluid in a mouse model of COPD induced
by elastase (Figure 6).
Inflammation and cellular senescence are
intertwined in the pathogenesis of COPD [8, 9]. Hence,
we also determine the expression of p16 and p21,
markers of cellular senescence, in lung tissues using
Western blot and immunohistochemistry. As expected,
intratracheal inject of elastase significantly caused
cellular senescence as reflected by an increase in p16
and p21 proteins in mouse lungs, and these effects
were reduced by prophylactic treatment of metformin
(Figure 7 and Figure 8). In contrast, Compound C further
enhanced the abundance of p16 and p21 proteins in
emphysematous mice induced by elastase. All together,
these findings suggest that AMPK protects against
emphysema by reducing inflammatory responses and
cellular senescence.

AMPKα1/α2 knockdown increased expression
gene involved in cellular senescence
To further determine role of AMPK in regulating
cellular senescence, we transfected BEAS-2B cells with
AMPKα1/α2 siRNA. As shown in Figure 3, transfection
of AMPKα1/α2 siRNA increased the mRNA of p16,
p21 and p66shc, but reduced klotho gene expression in
BEAS-2B cells. Altogether, AMPK reduces expression of
genes associated with cellular senescence.

significantly attenuated whereas an AMPK inhibitor
Compound C further augmented elastase-induced airspace
enlargement in mice. Altogether, AMPK reduces lung
cellular senescence and inflammatory responses, thereby
protecting against the development of emphysema.
Cellular senescence is a status where cells lose the
power to divide and grow. This is a protective mechanism
to avoid further DNA damage and mutation in response
to environmental and oxidative stress [14]. Senescent
cells are not metabolically quite. In contrast, these cells
are reprogrammed to prone to release inflammatory
mediators and matrix metalloproteinases, which further
cause and reinforce senescence and damage in neighbor
cells [15]. Recent studies highlight the importance of
cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of chronic lung
diseases including COPD and pulmonary fibrosis [16–19].
We showed here that cigarette smoke in vitro and elastase
in vivo augmented the expression of corresponding
p21 and p16 genes and proteins, which are key
p53-p21 and p16-pRb pathways for initiating
and propagating cellular senescence [20]. It
is interestingly to note that elastase treatment
(50 mU/ml, 24 h) did not affect the mRNA levels of p21
and p16 in BEAS-2B cells (data not shown). This suggests
that the mechanisms underlying elastase-induced cellular
senescence are different from cigarette smoke, which
needs further investigation. Klotho gene encodes a singlepass transmembrane protein that is expressed primarily in

Mitochondrial function plays an important role in
regulating inflammatory responses and cellular senescence
[10–12]. Therefore, we measured the abundance of
mitochondrial proteins SOD2 and SIRT3 in emphysematous
lungs treated with specific AMPK activator and inhibitor. In
response to elastase, the abundance of SOD2 and SIRT3
proteins was significantly reduced as compared to saline
control (Figures 7 and 8). The expression of SOD2 and
SIRT3 proteins was augmented by prophylactic treatment
of metformin, whereas Compound C further caused
reduction of SOD2 and SIRT3 proteins in emphysematous
lungs (Figures 7 and 8). These results indicate that the
protective effects of AMPK on emphysema are associated
with the up-regulation of mitochondrial proteins SOD2 and
SIRT3.

DISCUSSION
The inflammatory responses and cellular senescence
are closely entwined during the development of COPD/
emphysema [1, 13]. The mechanisms for lung cellular
senescence during the progression of COPD are not well
understood. Here we found that AMPK reduced cigarette
smoke-induced lung cellular senescence and inflammatory
responses in vitro using specific pharmacological activator
and inhibitor as well as genetic knockdown. Furthermore,

renal tubules [21, 22]. Klotho functions as an anti-aging
factor, and suppresses stress-induced cellular senescence
associated with inflammatory responses [23]. There are
several reports showing the reduction of klotho in lung
inflammatory and epithelial cells of COPD patients, which
contributes to inflammation and oxidative stress [24, 25].
Importantly, klotho deficient mice exhibit the phenotype
of emphysema [26, 27]. In agreement with these findings,
cigarette smoke exposure reduced the expression of klotho
gene in both human bronchial epithelial cells and small
airway epithelial cells in the present study. Our findings
further demonstrate the cellular senescence-associated
inflammatory phenotype as one of the pathobiological
mechanisms for the progression of COPD/emphysema,

as the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6,
IL-8, KC and MCP-1) were concurrently increased
in CSE-treated human lung epithelial cells in vitro
and elastase-exposed mouse lungs in vivo. Although
elastase induces lung cellular senescence, inflammatory
responses and oxidative stress which are intertwined to
cause emphysema [18, 28, 29], the long-term exposure
of cigarette smoke to lung epithelial cells is required
to determine cellular senescence phenotype and its
association with re-epithelialization.
A p66shc is a 66 kDa proto-oncogene Src
homologous-collagen homologue (Shc) adaptor protein,
which regulates intracellular oxidant levels, and is
recently identified as a longevity protein in mammals

[30]. The p66shc mainly localizes in mitochondria, and
regulates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)mediated signals [31]. Recent reports demonstrated that
mitochondria ROS and turnover play an important role in
cellular senescence and apoptosis during the development
of COPD [16, 17, 32]. Furthermore, p66shc knockout
mice developed respiratory bronchiolitis with fibrosis
but not emphysema in response to cigarette smoke
exposure [33]. This is corroborated by our findings that
mitochondrial antioxidant SOD2 and histone deacetylase
SIRT3 were reduced in mouse lungs with emphysema.
SOD2 neutralizes mitochondrial ROS [34, 35], while
SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics
[36, 37]. Therefore, the alterations of p66shc, SOD2
and SIRT3 may link mitochondrial ROS, biogenesis and
dynamics to cellular senescence during the development
of COPD/emphysema.

AMPK is a serine and threonine protein kinase,
which modulates cellular energy homeostasis metabolism
[4]. It has been labeled as an anti-aging and antiinflammatory molecule [5, 6]. Our preliminary findings
show the reduction of AMPKα1 phosporylation at Thr-172
in lungs of COPD pateints as compared to nonsmokers
(data not shown). This propels us to study the role of
AMPK in regulating lung inflammatory responses and
senscence. We for the first time found that an AMPK
activator AICAR reduced, whereas both AMPK inhibition
by Compound C and siRNA transfection enhanced
cigarette smoke-induced expression of genes involved
in cellular senescence. This may be one the mechanisms
for anti-inflammatory action (i.e., reduction of IL-6, IL-8,
KC and MCP-1) of AMPK in response to cigarette smoke
and elastase exposures. This is corroborated by the studies
showing that AMPK inhibits lung inflammatory responses

to cigarette smoke [38, 39]. A recent report demonstrates
that AMPK levels were reduced in the aortas of klotho
knockout mice [40]. It remains unknown whether klotho
affects AMPK activation during the development of
emphysema.
Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in
initiating inflammatory responses and cellular senescence
[10]. Indeeed, we found that AMPK negative regulated
p66shc but promoted the expression of SOD2 and SIRT3,
and all molecules are mainly distributed in mitochondria.
Both SOD2 and SIRT3 negatively regulates stress-induced
cellular senescence [41–43]. Therefore, the inhibitory
effects of AMPK againts inflammatory responses and

cellluar senescence may be due to its protection against
mitochondrial dysfunction. Further study is required for
determining the mechanisms by which AMPK regulates
mitochondrial function and dysnamics.
A recent study has shown that genetic knockout
of AMPKα1 enhances lung inflammatroy responses
and emphysema in mice exposed to cigarette smoking
and poly(I:C) [38]. We confirmed this finding using
an elastase-induced emphysema model as well as
prophylactic and therapeutic treatments with a specific
pharmacological AMPK activator metformin. The ongoing
experiments are ongoing to determine the therapeutic
effects of AMPK activators during the development

of emphysema induced by long-term cigareette smoke
exposure. Interestingly, there are two reports showing
that cigarette smoke promotes AMPK phophorylation,
and AMPK inhibiton reduced inflammatory responses
in lung epithelial cells and macrophages [44, 45]. The
descripancies among these studies are not clear, which
may due to the differences of cells (inflammatory vs.
structural cells; primary vs immortal cells), cigarette
smoke concentrations and durations. It should be noted
that both metformin and compound C have pleiotropic
effects [46, 47], and AMPK knockout mice treated with
these compounds would further consolidate the role of
AMPK in the development of COPD/emphysema.
Although both cigarettt smoke and elastase induce
pulmonary emphysema through proteolytic degradation
of the lung matrix, the mechanisms of this process
are likely very different [48]. Further study on these
mechanisms would reveal how AMPK protects against
lung inflammation and senescence, and lay a foundation to
identify potential therapeutic targets for COPD treatment.
In the preset study, we did not use the same stimulus
(cigarette smoke or elastase) for both in vitro and in vivo
studies. This is due to the facts that the cigarette smoke
model does not reproduce the most severe aspects of the
disease observed in humans, and requires 4–6 months
of exposure [49]. In contrast, in the elastase-induced
emphysema model, the disease develops rapidly and
severely, which is relatively easy (one time injection) and

cheap (do not need smoke machine/facility) to evaluate
potential therapeutics and interventions for emphysema
[50]. Hence, we employed an in vivo elastase (rather than
cigarette smoke) model to determine the role of AMPK in
protecting against pulmonary emphysema.
In conclusion, cigarette smoke exposure caused
inflammatory responses and expression of genes involved
in senescence in human bronchial epithelial cells and
small airway epithelial cells. Treatment with a specific
AMPK activator AICAR reduced, whereas Compound
C enhanced cigarette smoke-induced inflammatory
responses. Furthermore, administration of a specific
AMPK activator metformin attenuated elastase-induced
airspace enlargement, inflammatory responses and cellular
senescence in mice. Therefore, AMPK is a promising
therapeutic target for intervene with the progression of
COPD/emphysema by regulating inflammatory responses
and cellular senescence.

(AICAR, 1 mM, Sigma) and Compound C (5 μM,
Sigma).

TGGAGG for AMPKα2 [55]. The ratio of siRNA over
Lipofectamine 2000 in a well was 5 μl: 5 μl. 

Elastase-induced airspace enlargement and drug
administration
C57BL/6J mice (2–3 months old, both sexes) were
intratracheally administered with elastase after anesthesia
with pentobarbital, as described previously [7]. A 100 μl of
saline alone or saline containing 1 U of porcine pancreatic
elastase (Sigma) was injected into tracheal using the
MicrosSyringe with square tip [7, 56, 57]. Three weeks
was allowed to develop pulmonary emphysema after
elastase injection. During the third week after elastase
instillation, metformin (50 and 250 mg/kg) or Compound
C (4 and 20 mg/kg) was orally gavaged daily for 1 week to
determine the prophylactic effect of AMPK on pulmonary
emphysema. For therapeutic treatment, metformin (50
mg/kg) was orally administered daily for 1 week after
3 weeks of elastase injection when emphysema was
established. The animal protocol was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University.

CSE preparation
A Kentucky research 3R4F cigarette was lit, and
smoking was bubbled through 10 ml of cell culture
medium at a speed of 1 min per cigarette using a
negative pressure pump. This aqueous extract of smoking
was considered as 10% CSE with an OD value of 1 at
wavelength 320 nm, which was used for cell treatment
after a filtration through a 0.2 mm sterile filter. The CSE
was freshly prepared prior to cell treatment of each
experiment to avoid the breakdown of substances in the
extract and evaporation of volatile components.

BAL fluid collection

Quantitative real-time PCR

At the end of each experiment, pentobarbiturate
(100 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into mice
following by exsanguination. Left lung was fixed for
further histological analysis, and right lung was lavaged
four times with PBS (0.6 ml each time). BAL fluid was
collected and centrifuged at 350 g for 5 min at 4°C, and
the supernatant of the lavage fluid was stored at –80°C for
cytokine analysis.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was
generated using a Transcriptor ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis
kit (Qiagen), and the primers for p16, p21, klotho and
p66shc were used for PCR amplification [51–54]. The
primers were as follows: human  p16, 5′-CCCAACG

mRNA were determined using the Thermo PIKOREAL
96 real-time PCR detection system with QIAGEN SYBR
® Green supermix (Valencia, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The GAPDH gene was used
as an internal control for normalization.

Cytokine measurement
After cell treatments, culture supernatants were
collected through centrifugation, and then stored at −80°C
until analysis. The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were
quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay
(ELISA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The kits of human IL-6 and IL-8 were purchased from
the R&D Systems (R&D Systems, CA). The OD values
were read at 450 nm wavelength, and the real values of
IL-6 and IL-8 were plotted based on their standard curves.
Similarly, levels of mouse KC and MCP-1 in BAL fluid
were measured by the ELISA using commercial kits
(Elabscience Biotechnology Co, Ltd) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

AMPKα1/α2 siRNA transfection
To reduce endogenous AMPKα expression, BEAS2B cells were seeded onto a 6-well plate (1 × 106/well)
and transfected with human AMPKα1/α2 siRNA (Santa
Cruz Technology) at 50 nM using the Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) for 24 hours according to the instructions.

Frozen right lung tissues were homogenized with
RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor. Aliquots of
tissue lysates were used for protein analysis and then
separated on 12% SDS–PAGE. Separate proteins were
transferred onto the Immobilon-P transfer membranes
0.45 mm (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with
0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). After blocking for 3 h, the
membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (1:500
dilutions) in blocking buffer for 24h at 4°C. Primary
antibodies against SOD2 (ab68155), SIRT3 (ab86671),
p16 (ab51243) and p21 (ab109199) were purchased from
Abcam. After washing with TBST for 3 times (10 min
each), the membranes were incubated with secondary
anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000 dilutions in 5% skim milk)
linked to HRP for 1 h at room temperature, and then the
membranes were developed using ECL method (Millipore,
Billerica, U.S.A). β-actin was used as a loading control.
ImageJ densitometry software (Version 1.41; National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used for the band
quantification of Western blots.
