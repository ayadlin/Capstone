ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. About 80% of lung
cancers are non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Radiotherapy is widely used in
treatment of NSCLC. However, the outcome of NSCLC remains unsatisfactory. In
this study, a vascular disrupting agent (VDA) combretastatin-A4-phosphate (CA4P)
was used to provide massive necrosis targets. 131I labeled necrosis-avid agent
protohypericin (131I-prohy) was explored for therapy of NSCLC using tumor necrosis
targeted radiotherapy (TNTR). Gamma counting, autoradiography, fluorescence
microscopy and histopathology were used for biodistribution analysis. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) was used to monitor tumor volume, ratios of necrosis and
tumor doubling time (DT). The biodistribution data revealed 131I-prohy was delivered
efficiently to tumors. Tracer uptake peaked at 24 h in necrotic tumor of 131I-prohy with
and without combined CA4P (3.87 ± 0.38 and 2.96 ± 0.34%ID/g). 131I-prohy + CA4P
enhanced the uptake of 131I-prohy in necrotic tumor compared to 131I-prohy alone.
The TNTR combined with CA4P prolonged survival of tumor bearing mice relative to
vehicle control group, CA4P control group and 131I-prohy control group with median
survival of 35, 20, 22 and 27 days respectively. In conclusion, TNTR appeared to be
effective for the treatment of NSCLC.

Radiotherapy is widely used in both curative and
palliative treatment of NSCLC. With the development
of radiotherapy techniques, three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy showed better local control and possibly
better survival rates than traditional two-dimensional
radiation therapy for patients with medically inoperable
stage I NSCLC [5]. Precise definition of the tumor’s
anatomical extent is fateful for accurate location and
shaping of the radiotherapy beams. Image-guided
techniques such as 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning can improve
the targeting accuracy of NSCLC [6]. Due to respiration

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for about 85% of all cases of lung cancer [1].
Patients with NSCLC have distressingly short survival
times following diagnosis. Radical surgical resection
offers potential cure of NSCLC. One third of patients
with early stage of NSCLC are treated with surgery [2].
However, medically inoperable patients will be considered
for radiotherapy [3, 4].

and cardiac motion, tumor motion during radiation
treatment must be considered and addressed. Fourdimensional CT scanning enables accurate individualize
localization and radiotherapy based on tumor motion [7].
These advanced radiotherapy techniques greatly improved
the treatment of NSCLC. However, two obstacles still
exist in the control and eradication of NSCLC: 1) these
techniques are suitable for locoregional disease rather
than systemic therapy, for patients with metastatic disease,
the curative effect of these methods is unlikely; and
2) biological effective doses to eradicate tumor cannot be
delivered safely due to the risk of normal tissue toxicity.
Tumor targeted radiotherapy provides a challenging
approach for cancer therapy to overcome these obstacles.
Tumor necrosis treatment (TNT) is one of tumor
targeted radiotherapy method based on the hypothesis
that monoclonal antibodies which target abundant and
universal intracellular antigens retained by dying cells will
preferentially localize to necrotic regions of tumors [8].
Radionuclide combined with monoclonal antibodies can
be delivered to necrotic regions of tumors and emits
radiation to kill and/or restrain adjacent cancer cells.
Iodine-131 radiolabeled chimeric tumor necrosis therapy
monoclonal antibody (131I-chTNT) has been approved for
the treatment of advanced lung cancer in China. A study
showed 131I-chTNT was well tolerated with excellent
localization in tumors and 33% objective response rate
in NSCLC patients [9]. However, the macromolecule
immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies and the adverse
side effect bone marrow suppression became the main
reasons for limiting its application [10].
A substitute approach using small necrosis targeted
molecule can solve the problem of immunogenicity. Recent
years have witnessed accelerated progress in preclinical
development of necrosis targeted agents that potentially
could be used for TNTR. This method will provide a novel
approach for the treatment of NSCLC. Protohypericin
(prohy) is a polycyclic aromatic dianthraquinone
derived from plant Hypericum perforatum, and it can be
synthesized using emodin as the starting molecule. In our
previous studies, 131I-prohy was discovered with a unique
affinity to necrotic tissues in rat model of reperfused
hepatic infarction with a plasma elimination half-life of
14.9 h [11]. Whether radionuclide can be delivered with
prohy efficiently to tumors or not was investigate in this
study by detecting the biodistribution, autoradiography
and histopathology.
In addition, Combretastatin-A4-phosphate (CA4P)
is a tumor vascular disrupting agent (VDA) that can cause
rapid, selective, and extensive vascular damage, resulting
in extensive ischemic necrosis [12]. These necrotic regions
provide perfect targets for necrosis-avid agents. Therefore,
radionuclide labeled necrosis-avid agents combined with
a VDA may produce a synergetic method for TNTR.
To validate this approach for the treatment of NSCLC,
we investigated the anticancer efficacy of 131I-prohy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in combination with CA4P in a human NSCLC murine
xenotransplant model by analyzing the survival probability
and magnetic resonance imaging.

RESULTS
Animals and tumor model
Unilateral A549 tumor-bearing nude mice models
were established successfully. All mice survived the
surgery and anesthesia procedures without any drug
administration related deaths.

Biodistribution analysis
Data were exhibited in Table 1. The highest
radioactivity retention of 131I-prohy group and CA4P +
131
I-prohygroup occurred in almost all normal tissues
at early time point (4 h) after administration, and
decreased rapidly thereafter up to 120 h except necrotic
tumor. Relatively high uptakes of 131I-prohy were found
in the liver, viable tumor and necrotic tumor through
the detecting time points. The 131I-prohy radioactivity
accumulation of CA4P + 131I-prohy group in necrotic
tumor was significantly higher than that of 131I-prohy
group at 4 h, 24 h and 120 h (p < 0.05). The radioactivity
quantification of dissected tumor showed higher uptake in
necrotic tumor than viable tumor. The necrosis-to-viable
tumor ratios were 0.9, 2.3, 2.8 in 131I-prohy group, and 1.0,
2.6, 5.3 in CA4P + 131I-prohy group at 4 h, 24 h and 120 h.

Autoradiography and histopathology
Figure 1 represents typical images of intratumoral
biodistribution of 131I-prohy for CA4P + 131I-prohy group
and 131I-prohy group at 4 h, 24 h and 120 h. At each time
point, higher tracer uptake appeared mainly in the necrotic
tumor regions, which could be distinguished basing on the
histopathological examination with H&E staining (The
dark purple regions were viable tumor and the light pink
parts were necrotic tumor). These results were consistent
with the biodistribution data. The necrosis-to-viable tumor
ratios detected by a semiquantitative autoradiography
were 1.3, 9.3, 5.9 in 131I-prohy group, and 2.6, 10.3, 15.5
in CA4P + 131I-prohy group at 4 h, 24 h and 120 h.

Intratumoral location of prohy
In order to visualize the selective accumulation
of prohy at an accurate microscopic level, intratumoral
biodistribution was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
Based on the red fluorescence of prohy and H&E staining,
higher prohy uptake appeared in the necrotic tumor
regions (Figure 2) with the necrotic/viable tumor ratios of
1.1, 28.8, and 41.7 at 4 h, 24 h, and 120 h, respectively.
The accumulation of prohy at 4 h showed comparative

tumor region (Figure 3). However, the groups without
CA4P (group A and C) also showed some necrotic
region due to the spontaneous necrosis caused by a
proportion of degenerating or dead cells in addition to
numerous proliferating cells in rapidly growing tumors
[8]. Necrosis and viable tumor could be distinguished
by H&E stained microscopy (Figure 3 A6–E6).
Derived from the images, tumors in group A, B grew
much faster than that of group C and D.

Survival analysis

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

The groups administrated radiopharmaceutical
(Group C and Group D) prolonged survival of tumor
bearing nude mice, the median survival in group A, B,
C and D was 20 (range 16–29), 22 (range 18–30), 27
(range 20–33) and 35 (range 26–42) days respectively
(Figure  4A). Group D showed significantly longer
survival compared with group A, B (p < 0.01) and group
C (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found among
group A, B and C, but group C showed longer average
survival days than group A and B.

Tumors at baseline (Day 0) appeared slightly
hypointense or isointense on T1WI and hyperintense
on T2WI. On CE-T1 images, A549 tumors were
enhanced after administration of Magnevist, suggesting
the hypervascularity of the tumor. The groups
administrated with CA4P (group B and D) showed
a non-enhanced central region surrounded by a thin
rim enhancement on CE-T1 images, indicating the
presence of massive necrosis and minimum viable

0, 5, 10, 20. Tumors in group A. B. grew much faster than that of group C. and D. Macroscopic tumor (H&E) photographs
(A5–E5) showed extensive central necrosis surrounded by some viable tumor tissues in all groups of nude mice at endpoint. Microscopic
photographs (A6–E6) showed the interface between necrotic (N) and viable (V) tumor tissues in the 4 groups. Scale bar = 50 μm.

Tumor volume, tumor doubling time and
necrosis ratio

High tracer uptake appeared in tumor at each time
point, which may facilitate imaging detection of tumor.
The area of tracer uptake was approximate to the area
of entire tumor at day 5 and 10. However, the tracer
location appeared less than the area of entire tumor at
day 20, which may be due to the regrows of tumor and
the tracer located in the necrotic region of tumor.

Tumor volumes (Figure 4B) and the corresponding
necrosis ratio (Figure 4C) were calculated by MRI on
day 0, 5, 10, 15, 20. Tumor volumes at baseline (Day 0)
were approximate in group A, B, C and D, respectively
(p > 0.05). Significant difference of tumor volume was
found in group D compared with that of group A, B and
C (p < 0.05) from day 10 on. At day 20, mean tumor
volumes of group D was significantly smaller than group A
(p < 0.01), group B and C (p < 0.05). Tumor doubling
time of group D (16.1 ± 0.7 d) was significantly prolonged
in comparison with group A (7.8 ± 0.9 d), group B
(7.3 ± 0.3 d) and C (8.0 ± 1.7 d) (p < 0.01). There was no
significant difference (p > 0.05) of the tumor volume and
tumor doubling time at the same time point between group
A, B and C.
Spontaneous necrosis existed in A549 tumor
with the necrosis ratio approximately 13% in each
group as measured from CE-T1 MRI at baseline. After
CA4P injection, a significantly increased necrosis ratio
(p < 0.05) was obtained in group B and D. The
necrosis ratio of group B and D stayed steadily till
day 20. However, the necrosis ratio of group A and C
increased steadily due to the tumor spontaneous necrosis
occurrence during the tumor growing.

Toxicity analysis
Toxicity analysis (including blood indexes,
hepatic and renal function indexes) in all groups of
tumor-bearing nude mice with different drug treatment
was carried out on day 20 (Table 2). The white blood
cell numbers of group A were significantly lower
than group B (p < 0.05), group C and D (p < 0.01).
The higher white blood cell level of drug treatment
groups might be caused by the therapeutic response of
drugs. Other blood indexes in each group showed no
significant difference (p > 0.05). These results revealed
that 131I-prohy alone or combined therapy with CA4P
displayed no obvious inhibitory effect on blood system
and immune system.
Function indexes of liver (ALT, AST, ALB) and
kidney (BUN, CREA, UA) were measured to evaluate
the hepatic and renal damage after drug treatment.
Hepatic and renal function indexes of group C and D
revealed no obvious difference with group A (p > 0.05),
which suggested no signs of tissue damage after
treatment with 131I-prohy alone or the therapy combined
with CA4P.

DISCUSSION

I-prohy group at each detected time point (p < 0.05).
CA4P induced tumor vascular shutdown and subsequent
intratumoral necrosis, which provided extensive necrosis
targets. This may be the reason why the radioactivity
retention of CA4P + 131I-prohy group was higher than that
of the group using 131I-prohy alone. The relevant results of
TNTR in this study validated this suspicion.
In recent years, the anticancer effect is greatly
improved by shifting from traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapy to various targeted therapies [14]. Targeting
to cancer-specific pathway, universally-vital targets,
or tissues-specific targets showed different therapeutic
advantages [15]. However, cell death is a universal
feature existing in multiple pathological conditions,
such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer [16].
Tumor spontaneous necrosis and drug induced tumor
necrosis seem to be perfect tissues-specific targets with
broad tumor spectrum and abundant targets for cancer
treatment. In this study, 131I-prohy in combination with
CA4P prolonged survival and inhibited tumor growth of
nude mice in comparison to vehicle control group, CA4P
control group and 131I-prohy control group. These results
indicated an excellent anticancer effect of 131I-prohy to
prevent rapid tumor growth and recurrence. Previous studies
showed similar results by combining CA4P and 131I-labeled
necrosis avid compound (hypericin and sennidin A)
[17–19]. According to these promising results, TNTR may
be a good approach for the treatment of solid tumors.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used as
tumor targeting drug to directly inhibit tumor proliferation
or to target drugs to tumors, and it has revolutionized
131

In the present study, the biodistribution data from
gamma counting and autoradiography revealed that
131
I-prohy can be delivered efficiently to tumors. In
addition, 131I-prohy combined with tumor vascular
disrupting agent CA4P enhanced the uptake of 131I-prohy
in necrotic tumor and prolonged survival of A549 tumor
bearing nude mice compared with using 131I-prohy alone.
From these prominent results, it can be concluded that
TNTR appeared to be effective for the treatment of
NSCLC.
The immune system functioned as a primary defense
against cancer [13]. BALB/c nu/nu nude mouse lacks a
thymus and is unable to produce T cells, which is therefore
immunodeficient. For this reason, the anticancer efficacy
could be mainly attributed to the drug effects rather than
the natural immunity. The data from autoradiography
and intratumoral biodistribution of drug fluorescence are
consistent with gamma counting results, which revealed
the tumor necrotic affinity of prohy. This property of
prohy can be used for radionuclide imaging and TNTR.
131
I-prohy used alone or in combination with CA4P
showed some similar properties, such as high uptake in
blood, heart, muscle and bone at early time points after
administration and cleared rapidly afterwards. Both groups
showed higher accumulation of 131I-prohy in mononuclear
phagocyte system (lung, spleen and liver), necrotic tumor
and viable tumor than other normal tissues. However, the
radioactivity accumulation of CA4P + 131I-prohy group
in necrotic tumor was significantly higher than that of

tumor treatment and tumor imaging [20]. The mAb 14C5
has been developed for targeting tumor antigen 14C5,
which is highly expressed in human cancer cell lines such
as breast carcinoma (SK-BR-3, BT-20), lung carcinoma
(A549), colon carcinoma (HT-29) and so on. Ingrid
Burvenich et al. [21, 22] found that 131I-labeled mAb14C5
uptake peaked at 24 h in A549 NSCLC model and the
activity accumulation in tumor was higher compared with
that of 131I-prohy in combination with CA4P at the same
time point in this study. However, almost all of normal
organs and tissues showed higher radioactive retention
of 131I-labeled mAb14C5 compared with 131I-prohy.
The tumor-to-blood ratio of 131I-labeled mAb14C5
(about 1.0) was much lower than that of 131I-prohy in
combination with CA4P (about 5.2). Less radioactive
accumulation in normal tissues means less systemic
toxicity that is beneficial for the clinical application of
131
I-prohy. In addition, 131I-prohy as a low-molecularweight radiopharmaceutical can avoid unwanted host
immunological responses to foreign macromolecular
mAbs, which often happens after treatment with
mAbs [10, 23, 24].
TNTR provides a new approach for the treatment
of NSCLC. In this study, 131I-prohy combined with CA4P
did not show myelosuppression, hepatic and renal toxicity
during tumor therapy, which are all crucial for propelling
this anticancer strategy to clinical applications in human
cancer patients [25]. This strategy can be applied to wide
tumor spectrum and to treat primary and/or metastatic
solid tumors basing on massive necrosis targets in
the tumor provided by VDAs. Nevertheless, the exact
mechanism for necrosis affinity of prohy remains unclear
and the therapeutic effect need to be verified in other
tumor models. Studies about these aspects will be made
in the near future.
In conclusion, the current study demonstrated
radionuclide can be delivered with prohy efficiently
to tumors. Moreover, 131I-prohy combined with CA4P
enhanced the uptake of 131I-prohy in necrotic tumor
compared with 131I-prohy used alone. TNTR especially in
combination with CA4P inhibited tumor growth, extended
tumor doubling time and prolonged survival of A549
tumor bearing mice.

China), was cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO), 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin at 37°C in
5% CO2. Xenografts were initiated by inoculating 1 × 106
tumor cells subcutaneously into a unilateral flank region of
mice. All animals were given Lugol’s solution in drinking
water to block thyroid gland from taking up free 131I.

Drug preparations

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Prohy was synthesized and purified using the
method described by Falk et al [26]. The synthetic product
was identified as prohy by HPLC-MS/MS, 1H-NMR,
and 13C-NMR. The related parameters can be seen in
our previous study [11]. The purity was over 98% as
determined by HPLC. CA4P (purchased from HuaMei
technology, Wuhan, China), was diluted in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) solution (10 mg/ml). Sodium iodide
(131I, 740 MBq/mL) was provided by HTA (Beijing,
People’s Republic of China).
The Iodogen coating method was used for
radiolabeling prohy. Briefly, prohy was dissolved
in DMSO and mixed with Na131I solution (volume
ratio, 4:1) and 50 μg Iodogen as the mixture solution.
In order to decrease the percentage of DMSO
used for injection, polyethylene glycol-400 and
propylene glycol were used for dilution. The volume
proportion of the mixture solution, polyethylene
glycol-400 and propylene glycol was 1:7:7. The
labeling yield was greater than 97% determined
by HPLC with a pump (waters 2695, Millipore,
Billerica, MA) and UV/Visible detector (waters 2998,
Millipore, Billerica, MA) and HERM LB500 LC
radio detector (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad,
Black Forest, Germany) and a Alltima C18 column (250
× 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Mobile
phase was methanol/ammonium acetate (6 mM) 85:15 at
a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. All experimental procedures
were performed in the dark environment. The safety of
oxidizing agent Iodogen has been proved by Miranda
Cona et al [27]. Considering the high radiochemical
purity of 131I-prohy (over 97%) and the low dosage of
oxidizing agent (only 50 μg Iodogen) used in this study,
131
I-prohy was not purified after preparation to remove
Iodogen and the precursor prohy.

Animals and tumor model

Experimental protocols

All animal care, use, and experimental procedures
were approved by the Animal Affairs Committee of
Jiangsu Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(Nanjing, Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China). BALB/c
nu/nu male nude mice (18–20 g), 4 to 6 weeks old, were
provided by the Experimental Animal Center of the same
agency. Human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell line
was obtained from KeyGen Biotech Co. Ltd (Nanjing,

Flow diagram of the whole experiment was
displayed in Figure 6. Tumor size was assessed regularly
with a vernier caliper using the formula width2 × length
× 0.5. The experiment began when the tumor reached a
diameter of 0.7 ± 0.2 cm three weeks after implantation.
Nude mice were randomly divided into 2 major groups:
one group was used for biodistribution analysis; another
group was for TNTR study.

interest analysis for the necrotic and viable tumor as well
as liver tissue on all autoradiographs. Necrotic and viable
tumor was distinguished according to the histological
examination of H&E stained sections. Autoradiograph of
liver was used as a reference of radioactivity.

Thirty six A549 tumor-bearing nude mice were
divided into two subgroups. One group received iv
injection of 131I-prohy, another group received sequential
iv injections of CA4P (10 mg/kg) and 131I-prohy
(18.5 MBq/Kg, 24 h after administration CA4P). During
drug injection, animals were anesthetized using a smallanimals gas anesthesia machine (Matrix VMP; GENE&I,
Beijing, People’s Republic of China) with isoflurane.
Animals of each group were sacrificed by decapitation
at 4 h, 24 h, 120 h (n = 6, each time point). Tissues of
interest were harvested and washed with normal saline.
After dried with gauzes, these tissues were weighted and
measured the radioactivity with an automatic gamma
counter (WIZARD; 2470, Perkin Elmer, New York,
USA). Corrections were made for background radiation
and physical decay during counting. All biodistribution
results were expressed as percentage of the injected dose
per gram of tissues (% ID/g).

Intratumoral location of prohy
Tumor at each time point for biodistribution analysis
of 131I-prohy group were cut into 5 μm frozen sections
and examined using a fluorescence microscopy (Vert A1,
ZEISS, Gottingen, Germany) to acquire fluorescence
images as prohy can emit red fluorescence. Fluorescence
microscopy parameters: Rhod, filter set 20, excitation
BP 546/12, beam splitter FT 560, emission BP 575–640.
Afterwards, these sections were stained with H&E. The
relative fluorescence density of the necrotic region and
the normal region of tumor, which can be distinguished
based on the histological examination of H&E stain, was
calculated with ZEN software (Vert A1, ZEISS, Gottingen,
Germany) by drawing the regions of interest.

Autoradiography and histopathology

Tumor necrosis targeted radiotherapy study

Tumor and liver at each time point of biodistribution
analysis were sampled and cut into 50 μm frozen
sections with a cryotome (Shandon, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Autoradiographs of these 50
μm Sections were obtained by 12–24 h exposure to a high
performance storage phosphor screen. Images of the screen
were read using Optiquant software (Cyclone; CanberraPackard, Ontario, Canada). Subsequently, tumor sections
were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and digitally
photographed. Relative tracer concentration in the necrotic
tumor was estimated by manually drawing the regions of

Forty two tumor-bearing nude mice were
divided into four subgroups (n = 9, each group, 6 extra
animals were added in Group D for general phosphor
screen analysis): group A of vehicle controls received
iv injections of the solvents of CA4P and 131I-prohy; group
B of CA4P control received CA4P (10 mg/kg) and solvent
of 131I-prohy; group C of 131I-prohy control received
131
I-prohy (185 MBq/Kg) and solvent of CA4P; group D
of CA4P + 131I-prohy treatment received iv injections of
CA4P (10 mg/kg) and 131I-prohy (185 MBq/Kg).

Survival analysis

Body weight was recorded daily to monitor
the health of nude mice. Animals of group D were
sacrificed by overdose of anesthetic at day 5, 10, 20 post
administration (n = 2 per time point) and cut into 0.5 cm
slices after freezing for anatomical autoradiography
analysis. Anatomical autoradiographs were obtained by
6 h exposure to a high performance storage phosphor
screen to observe the biodistribution in the body of nude
mice. Blood was collected at day 20 (n = 3 per group) for
hematological biochemical parameters analysis including
blood indexes, hepatic and renal function indexes
(Modular DP, Roche Company, Mannheim, Germany)
to evaluate the drug toxicity. Time to endpoint of every
nude mouse was recorded for survival analysis. At
endpoint, tumors were excised and cut into 5 μm frozen
sections for histopathological findings. Histopathology
of group A, B, C and D were carried out for postmortem
verification.

For survival analysis, animal death was defined
as the primary endpoint and was recorded every day.
Standardized humane endpoint was used to euthanize
animals, which referred to animals failed to eat and
drink for over 3 days and without any limb movement.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS for
Windows software package (version 17.0; Chicago,
IL, USA). All quantitative data were expressed as
mean ± SD. Two-tailed independent samples t-test was
used for the comparison of biodistribution between
131
I-prohy group and CA4P + 131I-prohy group. For
survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
made with p value generated from log-rank test. For
other comparisons among groups, a one-way ANOVA
was used. P value less than 0.05 was considered to be
significant difference.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI was performed before administration and
every 5 days after administration to monitor and
quantify tumor volume and necrosis using a clinical
1.5T MR magnet (Echo speed; GE, Milwaukee,
WI). Nude mouse was anesthetized by a smallanimals gas anesthesia machine (Matrix VMP;
GENE&I, Beijing, People’s Republic of China) with
isoflurane and placed in a mouse holder in supine
position for imaging acquisition. T1-weighted,
T2-weighted and contrast enhanced T1-weighted
(CE-T1) spin-echo multi-slice transverse images were
acquired. Related parameters are transverse plane
in all mice with slice thickness of 1 mm and a gap of
0 mm; T1WI (Sequences SE, TR/TE = 550 ms/24 ms);
T2WI (Sequences FSE, TR/TE = 2920 ms/88 ms).
CE-T1 (Sequences SE) was detected after iv injection
of Magnevist (Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin,
Germany) at 0.2 mmol/ Kg.
Tumor areas were manually delineated the outline of
the tumor mass on CE-T1 MRI slices. Tumor volume was
calculated use the following equation: tumor volume = Σ
[tumor area on each slice × (slice thickness)]. Tumor
necrotic area was delineated from CE-T1 images as
central non-enhancing region to generate tumor necrotic
volume. The ratios of necrosis were defined as the volume
of necrosis over that of the entire tumor. Necrosis ratios
were calculated based on the equation: necrosis ratio =
Σ (area of necrosis × slice thickness) / (area of whole
tumor × slice thickness) × 100%. Tumor doubling time
(DT) was calculated according to the formula: DT = (T T0) × log 2 / (log V – log V0), where (T - T0) represents
the length of time between two measurements, V0
and V indicate the tumor volume at the two points of
measurement [28].
