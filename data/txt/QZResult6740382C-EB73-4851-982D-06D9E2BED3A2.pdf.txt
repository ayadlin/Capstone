Abstract
Metastatic ovarian cancer (OvCa) frequently recurs due to chemoresistance, highlighting the need for nonoverlapping combination therapies that mechanistically synergize to eradicate residual disease. Photodynamic
therapy (PDT), a photochemistry-based cytotoxic modality, sensitizes ovarian tumors to platinum agents and
biologics and has shown clinical promise against ovarian carcinomatosis. We introduce a three-dimensional
(3D) model representing adherent ovarian micrometastases and high-throughput quantitative imaging
methods to rapidly screen the order-dependent effects of combining benzoporphyrin-derivative (BPD) monoacid A–based PDT with low-dose carboplatin. 3D ovarian micronodules grown on Matrigel were subjected to
BPD-PDT either before or after carboplatin treatment. We developed custom fluorescence image analysis
routines to quantify residual tumor volume and viability. Carboplatin alone did not eradicate ovarian
micrometastases at a dose of 400 mg/m2, leaving surviving cores that were nonsensitive or impermeable to
chemotherapy. BPD-PDT (1.25 μmol/L·J/cm2) created punctate cytotoxic regions within tumors and disrupted
micronodular structure. Treatment with BPD-PDT prior to low-dose carboplatin (40 mg/m2) produced a
significant synergistic reduction [P < 0.0001, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)] in residual tumor volume
[0.26; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.19–0.36] compared with PDT alone (0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.92) or
carboplatin alone (0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.09), relative to controls. This synergism was not observed with the
reverse treatment order. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the use of a 3D model for micrometastatic
OvCa as a rapid and quantitative reporter to optimize sequence and dosing regimens of clinically relevant
combination strategies. This approach combining biological modeling with high-content imaging provides
a platform to rapidly screen therapeutic strategies for a broad array of metastatic tumors. Cancer Res; 70(22);

Introduction
The vast majority of ovarian cancer (OvCa) cases are
diagnosed once the disease has metastasized to distant
sites, which substantially diminishes the possibility of providing curative treatments (1–4). Despite advancements in
surgical debulking techniques, optimization of chemotherapeutic regimens, and improvements in radiotherapy, 5-year
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

rates remain low even among women whose disease is
optimally cytoreduced to ≤1 cm in diameter (1, 5). These
results indicate that unresected tumor nodules respond
poorly to traditional agents, primarily due to poor drug
penetration (6, 7) and the development of resistance
(8–10). There is a critical need to design and rapidly evaluate more effective management strategies for residual
OvCa. Identifying the most promising treatments among
the vast library of candidate agents has been a slow and
unreliable process due, in part, to a lack of high-throughput
model systems that capture critical aspects of tumor biology (1, 11, 12). We address this limitation, by developing
an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) model for adherent
micrometastatic OvCa, which, in conjunction with custom
image analysis routines designed in our group, serves as a
high-throughput reporter for treatment efficacy. We use this
platform to evaluate a mechanism-based combination regimen that synergistically enhances carboplatin efficacy with
photodynamic therapy (PDT), a photophysical cytotoxic
modality that sensitizes OvCa cells to chemo and biological
agents (4, 13), and has shown promise in clinical trials for
the treatment of ovarian carcinomatosis (14–19).

Rationally designed combination therapies provide the
best hope of improving outcomes for patients with advanced stage disease, by exploiting nonoverlapping cellular targets, improving drug transport, and mitigating the
survival signals that lead to treatment resistance (1, 4, 8,
13, 20–22). Despite improvements from combining chemotherapeutics (2, 9, 10, 23), rates of recurrence in patients with advanced stage OvCa remain as high as
80%, indicating that traditional chemotherapies by themselves hold little promise of significantly effecting PFS and
OS (8, 9).
We (4, 13) and others (21, 22) have shown that PDTbased combination regimens sensitize tumors, including
OvCa, to chemotherapeutics and targeted biological inhibitors. PDT involves activation of a photosensitive molecule
by light of a specific wavelength to generate reactive species (18, 21, 24–29) and is approved for a variety of applications including actinic keratosis, non–small cell lung
cancer, and palliation of obstructive esophageal cancer using Photofrin (24, 26). PDT is also approved globally as a
first line therapy for age-related macular degeneration (24)
using benzoporphyrin-derivative monoacid ring A (BPDMA; verteporfin), which offers better photobiological activity and shorter cutaneous phototoxicity than Photofrin
(4, 29–31).
BPD also provides promising results for the treatment of
multifocal OvCa (4, 31, 32). We have reported that BPD-PDT
combined with Erbitux, an antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor, synergistically reduces tumor
burden and enhances survival in a mouse model for ovarian
carcinomatosis (4). Combining these mechanistically distinct monotherapies mitigates the limitations of each
modality (4). Molpus and colleagues showed that multiple
cycles of BPD-PDT were required to achieve a therapeutic
benefit in a murine model for ovarian carcinomatosis (31).
Erbitux, a cytostatic therapy, is administered at high doses
for extended periods with modest improvements in survival
(33). Combining BPD-PDT with Erbitux improved acute and
long-term therapeutic outcomes, with fewer treatment
cycles and minimal toxicity (4). These promising results
have informed large animal studies leading to clinical trials
using BPD-PDT in combination with Erbitux to treat metastatic OvCa (32, 34).
In a variant of this approach, photoimmunotherapy (PIT),
chlorin e 6 was conjugated to a monoclonal antibody,
OC125, creating a therapeutically active targeting moiety
(13). In cisplatin-resistant tissue, PIT reversed chemoresistance and produced a synergistic 12.9-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared with cisplatin alone. The combination
treatment had an additive effect in cisplatin-sensitive tissue.
Among all patient tissue samples and cell lines, PIT
increased OvCa sensitivity to cisplatin by 6.9-fold compared
with cisplatin alone (13).
Here, we introduce an in vitro 3D tumor model for adherent, micrometastatic OvCa, adapted from breast cancer
models (35, 36), as a treatment response platform to efficiently evaluate combination therapies. These ovarian 3D
tumors represent unresectable, multifocal micronodules

that are typically managed with chemotherapy and are
precursors to recurrent metastatic disease (1–3). We use
this biological and imaging-based platform to determine
the effect of combining BPD-PDT and carboplatin. We
hypothesized that the interaction between these mechanistically distinct cytotoxic modalities would lead to synergistic enhancement of the monotherapies. Our results
show that carboplatin alone does not eradicate OvCa
at clinically relevant doses and demonstrate for the first
time a sequence-dependent synergistic enhancement of
carboplatin efficacy by BPD-PDT.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
NIH:OVCAR5 human epithelial OvCa cells were obtained
from Thomas Hamilton (Fox Chase Cancer Institute) and
previously characterized by microsatellite marker analysis.
Cells were maintained as previously described (4).
Monolayer cultures. OVCAR5 cells were plated in 35-mm
dishes (BD Biosciences) at a density of 210,000 in 2 mL
medium.
3D cultures. Protocols for 3D ovarian cultures were
adapted from previously published methods for breast
cancer cell lines (35, 36). Briefly, 150 or 250 μL growth factor
reduced-Matrigel (GFR-Matrigel; BD Biosciences) was
pipetted into the center well of a chilled 35-mm MatTek dish
(P35G-0-20-C; MatTek Corp.) or each well of a black-walled
24-well plate (Genetix W1350). An OVCAR5 single cell suspension (500 μL of 1.5 × 104 cells/mL) was pipetted onto each
dish/well. After 30 minutes, 3D culture medium was added to
a final concentration of 2% GFR-Matrigel and changed every
2 to 3 days.
Growth characterization
Darkfield microscopy images (five fields per culture per
time point) were acquired using an inverted microscope
(Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV) with a charge-coupled device camera (Quantifire XI) and saved as uncompressed TIFFs. Image data were batch-processed using custom MATLAB
(Mathworks) routines to report equivalent diameters
of automatically segmented (nearly) circular regions
corresponding to 3D nodules as previously described (37).
N values represent individual 3D culture dishes, and SDs
report the reproducibility of mean diameter from independent platings. Time lapse of 10× phase contrast sequences
were obtained using a Nikon TE2000-S microscope in a
weather station (37°C, 5% CO2).
Immunofluorescence protocol
A previously established immunofluorescence protocol
was used (38). Human fibronectin (Sigma F0916) and
mouse anti-E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories
C20820) antibodies were fluorescently labeled using Alexa
Fluor568 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (A11004, Invitrogen). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma
32670) was diluted 1:1,000 in PBS to stain nuclei.

(±25.3 μm) at day 17 (n = 3; E).
Scale bars, 20 μm (B and C) and
150 μm (D).

Treatments
Carboplatin. To establish dose response in monolayer
versus 3D, cultures were treated with 0.4–400 mg/m 2
carboplatin in either standard medium (monolayer) or
standard medium with 2% GFR-Matrigel (3D medium).
Cytotoxicity was evaluated following either a 24-hour incubation in monolayer or 96-hour incubation in 3D cultures.
Carboplatin treatments for all combination therapy experiments were initiated on day 10 postplating and terminated
on day 14 using a dose of 40 mg/m2 to keep the carboplatin dose and incubation period fixed for both treatment
sequences.
PDT. Cultures were incubated with 250 nmol/L BPD-MA
(QLT, Inc.) for 90 minutes in standard medium. Immediately prior to irradiation, BPD-MA medium was replaced
with either fresh standard medium (monolayer cultures)
or standard medium with 2% GFR-Matrigel (3D cultures).
Each dish/well was irradiated with a 690-nm fiber-coupled
diode laser (Model 7401; High Power Devices, Inc.) at a
fluence rate of 40 mW/cm2 (VEGA Laser Power Energy
Meter, Ophir Laser Measurement Group, LLC). For monolayer versus 3D culture experiment, fluences of 0.1, 1.0, 2.5,
or 5.0 J/cm2 were delivered for total PDT doses ([PS] ×
fluence) of 0.025, 0.25, 0.625, and 1.25 μmol/L·J/cm2, respectively. To determine sequence-dependent cytotoxic
response in combination therapy experiments, 3D cultures
were treated with 1.25 μmol/L·J/cm2 BPD-PDT on either
day 10 or day 14 postplating (prior to or on completion
of carboplatin treatment, respectively).
Controls were subjected to sham manipulations.
N values for treatment studies represent individual
3D cultures over a minimum of three independent
platings.

High-throughput fluorescence imaging and
cytotoxicity analysis
Cultures were incubated with LIVE/DEAD reagents
(Invitrogen, L-3224), calcein AM (live), and ethidium
bromide (dead), which overcome limitations of MTT
and MTS that bind to GFR-Matrigel. Using an Olympus
FV-1000 confocal microscope with automated stage, multichannel fluorescence images from multiwell dishes were
acquired in high throughput using a 4× objective (488 nm
excitation, with FITC emission filter and 559 nm excitation,
with TRITC emission filter for calcein and ethidium homodimer-1, respectively). Laser and photomultiplier tube
settings, optimized for maximum dynamic range, were
internally consistent across experimental groups.
Therapeutic efficacy was quantified by two metrics: (a)
residual tumor volume, a measure of how much viable
disease remains on each plate, and (b) tumor viability,
a ratiometric quantification of how viable the residual
disease is. Image data sets were batch-processed using
custom MATLAB routines (37). Calcein images were
segmented (as above) to calculate nodule volumes from
equivalent diameters, deq, by,

and then summed to determine total volume reported as
fraction of the no-treatment control. Tumor viability was
quantified by the ratio of calcein to total fluorescence
intensity (calcein plus ethidium) and normalized to no
treatment as previously described (37).

marize the effect of treatment on each of these measures of
outcome. As a result of this, the confidence intervals will not
be symmetrical about the mean. Analyses were performed
separately for each sequence.

Results
Model development and size characterization
OVCAR5 cells overlaid as a single-cell suspension on a bed
of GFR-Matrigel spontaneously formed 3D multicellular
tumor nodules resembling adherent micrometastatic disease
(Fig. 1A–D). Ten days after plating, the 3D micronodules
demonstrated cell surface and intracellular punctate E-cadherin
expression (Fig. 1B), a distribution pattern associated
with metastatic ovarian tumors (3, 39). Micronodules were
also encapsulated in a basement membrane containing
human fibronectin (Fig. 1C), a marker correlated with metastatic, chemoresistant, and recurrent disease, indicating the
poorest outcome for OvCa patients (40, 41). Migration,
assembly, and proliferation events (Supplementary Movie S1)
led to heterogeneous 3D nodules resembling micrometastatic disease within 11 days of plating (Fig. 1D). The micronodules grew from a mean diameter of 34.3 μm (±2.6 μm)
3 days postplating (n = 9) to a mean diameter of 108.9 μm
(±13.0 μm) at day 10 (n = 9) and 131.9 μm (±25.3 μm) at
day 17 (n = 3; Fig. 1E).
Figure 2. Monolayer cultures significantly overestimate carboplatin
and BPD-PDT efficacy compared with cells in 3D. A, fractional viability of
OVCAR5 cells in monolayer (striped) following carboplatin treatment
(40 mg/m2) was 0.30 (±0.082; n = 10) compared with 0.90 (±0.057) in 3D
(solid; n = 6; P < 0.001, two-tailed t test). B, left, monolayer cultures
treated with 1.25 μmol/L·J/cm2 BPD-PDT had a fractional viability of 0.35
(±0.04; n = 12) compared with 0.75 (±0.04) in 3D (n = 13; P = 0.003,
two-tailed t test). N values vary from 6 to 16 for individual treatment
groups within each culture condition. B, right, confocal fluorescence
images show BPD-MA distribution and autofluorescence from a
representative nodule. Scale bars, 25 μm.

Statistical analysis
For each experiment, we fit ANCOVA models for the effect
from each intervention (PDT, carboplatin, and the combination treatments), adjusting for batch and day (which ensured
that the proper control group was used for the comparison).
To keep the carboplatin dose and schedule fixed for both
treatment sequences, the time points for PDT treatment
and cytotoxic evaluation had to be adjusted between the
two sequences as described in Treatments. Statistical analysis for synergism was conducted independently for each
sequence, with separate and appropriate controls for each
of the two combination treatment schedules. To analyze
the synergy, we fit a single ANCOVA model with indicators
for carboplatin and PDT, and the interaction between these
variables was the basis for assessing the effect of the combination above that of the additive effects of each treatment
alone. All analyses were performed on the log-transformed
variables (of proportion viable and tumor volume), so the
parameter associated with the difference of treatment versus
control (from the ANCOVA) was then exponentiated to sum-

Differential response to treatment with carboplatin
and PDT in monolayer versus 3D
Cytotoxic response to escalating doses of carboplatin or
PDT in 3D versus traditional monolayer cultures (Fig. 2A
and B) was evaluated by quantitative imaging of LIVE/
DEAD reagents. Monolayer cultures significantly overestimate the sensitivity of OvCa cells to carboplatin treatment.
At 40.0 mg/m2 (one tenth of the clinically effective dose for
i.p. administered carboplatin; ref. 42) OVCAR5 cells showed
3-fold higher sensitivity to carboplatin in monolayer than
the same cells in 3D: 0.30 (±0.082) fraction viability in
monolayer (n = 10) compared with 0.90 (±0.057) fraction
viability in 3D (n = 6; P < 0.001, two-tailed t test), relative
to no treatment controls (n = 11 and 6 for monolayer and
3D, respectively; Fig. 2A).
At a PDT dose of 1.25 μmol/L·J/cm2 (0.250 μmol/L BPD
and 5.0 J/cm2 of 690 nm light), the fraction viability in monolayer OVCAR5 cultures was 0.35 (±0.04; n = 12), relative to no
treatment controls (n = 12; Fig. 2B). At the same PDT dose in
3D, the fraction viability was 0.75 (±0.04; n = 13), relative to
no treatment controls (n = 16). These notable differences in
viability indicate that OVCAR5 cells are more than twice as
sensitive to BPD-PDT in monolayer compared with the same
cells in 3D cultures (P = 0.003, two-tailed t test).
3D model reveals differential patterns of cytotoxic
response for carboplatin versus PDT
Close examination of cytotoxicity in 3D ovarian micronodules treated 10 days after plating with either carboplatin
or PDT alone revealed distinct cell death patterns for
the individual monotherapies (Fig. 3A and B). A persistent

population of viable surviving cores was observed following
incubation with 400 mg/m2 carboplatin. As shown in a representative nodule (Fig. 3A), the ethidium bromide (dead)
signal had a peak width of 15 to 20 μm (full width at half
maximum) on the periphery of carboplatin-treated micronodules, which overlapped minimally with calcein green (live)
fluorescence from the inner core of the same micronodule.
This cytotoxicity pattern indicates the presence of a surviving core that was nonsensitive or impermeant to carboplatin.
Similar analysis of BPD-PDT–treated micronodules
revealed a contrasting cytotoxic pattern. Figure 3B shows a
representative micronodule treated with 1.25 μmol/L·J/cm2
BPD-PDT and fluorescence intensity profiles from two

regions of interest in the micronodule. BPD-PDT disrupts
micronodular structure and creates punctuate regions of
highly overlapping calcein green and ethidium bromide
fluorescence peaks.
Sequence-dependent synergistic reduction in viability
and tumor burden in 3D micronodules treated with
combination PDT and carboplatin
Based on the distinct cytotoxic mechanisms for carboplatin (8, 23, 42) versus BPD-PDT (4, 27, 29) and the differential
cell death patterns observed here, we hypothesized that the
two modalities could synergize to enhance efficacy at lower
doses. We tested this hypothesis by treating the ovarian

n = 15) or carboplatin alone (0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97;
n = 11; Fig. 5).
Conversely, no synergy was observed between the monotherapies with the reverse treatment order; carboplatin
followed by BPD-PDT (Fig. 6). Mean fraction residual tumor
burden with either PDT alone or carboplatin alone was
0.61 (95% CI, 0.55–0.68; n = 18) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61–0.67;
n = 18), respectively, relative to no treatment (n = 18; Fig. 6A).
The discrepancy in treatment response in the carboplatinonly arm between the two sequences (Figs. 4 and 6A or Figs.
5 and 6B), is due to the adjustment in the time point of
evaluation necessitated by a fixed carboplatin schedule
and duration as described in Materials and Methods. Compared with the monotherapies, the reverse combination
treatment produced the most substantial decrease in mean
fraction residual tumor burden (0.36; 95% CI, 0.34–0.39;
n = 18), but this reduction was not synergistic (P = 0.3326,
ANCOVA). Similarly, mean fraction viability in micronodules
treated with either PDT alone or carboplatin alone was 0.78
(95% CI, 0.74–0.82; n = 18) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77–0.82;
n = 18), respectively, compared with 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62–
0.69; n = 18) in the combination carboplatin + PDT group,
indicating no interaction between the two modalities
(P = 0.1368, ANCOVA; Fig. 6B).

PDT has shown clinical promise for the treatment of
disseminated OvCa (14–17, 19) and will likely be most effective as part of a multifaceted treatment strategy to overcome
resistance mechanisms that lead to treatment failure. The
data presented in this study demonstrate a treatment
order–dependent synergism with BPD-PDT and low-dose
carboplatin using a 3D high-throughput reporter for adherent ovarian micrometastases.
Mechanistic differences between the individual modalities
could account for the sequence-dependent synergism. Carboplatin is hydrolyzed as it enters a cell, creating an active
species that forms interstrand and intrastrand DNA adducts.
Depending on the extent of damage, the cell either enters
cell cycle arrest or undergoes apoptosis, probably via ATMCHK2–mediated activation of p53 in the nucleus (8, 43).
This triggers transcriptional upregulation of proapoptotic
proteins Bax/Bak and downregulation of antiapoptotic
Bcl-2/Bcl-XL in the cytosol, causing permeabilization of the
outer mitochondrial membrane. Cytochrome c is subsequently released from the mitochondria followed by activation of caspase 9 and effector caspases 3, 6, and 7, which
triggers the apoptotic machinery that is responsible for
DNA fragmentation and protein degradation typical of
programmed cell death (8, 23, 42, 43).
In contrast, BPD-PDT bypasses the nuclear signaling
pathways that platinum agents rely on by damaging the
mitochondrial membrane and initiating cytochrome
c–mediated apoptosis or by directly destroying Bcl-2 associated with the mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum
(ER; refs. 4, 18, 26, 27, 29, 31). The observed synergism between the two modalities could, therefore, be explained by

BPD-PDT + Carboplatin Synergism in a 3D Ovarian Cancer Model

a combination of three possible mechanisms. (a) BPD-PDT is
in itself cytotoxic to target cells and decreases the size of residual ovarian tumors. As recently quantified by Celli and
colleagues (37), BPD-PDT shifts OvCa size distribution toward smaller nodules, in contrast to carboplatin, which
had minimal effect on size reduction. These results could
have important implications for designing more effective
therapeutic regimens, because small OvCa nodules are associated with significantly better PFS, OS, and response to chemotherapy than large tumors (5, 42). (b) BPD-PDT also
disrupts nodular architecture creating tumors that are more
vulnerable to carboplatin. High cellular density is a critical
barrier to the penetration and accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents in tumors (7). Treatment-induced apoptosis
has specifically been shown to decrease cellular density
and enhance the uptake of chemotherapies into tumor
micronodules (7). Therefore, BPD-PDT–mediated apoptotic
disruption of micronodular architecture could play an important role in improving the delivery of platinum-based agents
into residual OvCa nodules. This enhanced diffusion is
particularly important within the context of i.p. administration of carboplatin, which relies on surface penetration
of the drug to achieve therapeutic benefit (42, 44). (c) At
the subcellular level, BPD-PDT sensitizes surviving cells to
nuclear apoptotic signaling initiated by carboplatin, thereby
lowering the threshold required to achieve a cytotoxic effect.
The sequence-dependent synergism could therefore be driven by the ability of BPD-PDT to reduce the size and disrupt
the structure of ovarian micronodules, in addition to sensitizing the cells to apoptotic signals from carboplatin treatment. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the
mechanisms for the observed synergism and to cross validate
these findings with tumor regrowth in 3D as well as focused
in vivo and patient tissue experiments.
The applicability of these findings to a broader library of
photosensitizers and chemotherapies needs to be considered within the context of cytotoxic mechanisms. PDTinduced cellular damage can trigger a combination of
nonspecific necrosis, apoptosis, or autophagy (18, 21). The
predominance of a particular cytotoxic pathway depends on
a variety of factors including the photophysical properties
and preferred localization (and relocalization) sites of a
photosensitizer, the local microenvironment, the fluence
rate, and the PDT dose, as well as compensatory survival
mechanisms (18, 21, 24–29). BPD, mesochlorin, and aluminum (III) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate chloride (AlPcS(4))
localize primarily to the mitochondria and are efficient
inducers of apoptosis (24, 26, 27, 29). A more complex
response is observed with photosensitizers that localize to
the ER such as AlPcCl and 9-capronyloxytetrakis (methoxyethyl) porphycene (18). Depending on the PDT dose,
autophagy can be induced as either a prosurvival or prodeath
pathway, which could be important in cells with defective
apoptotic machinery or resistance to apoptosis and should
be considered in mechanism-based combination regimens.
A variety of photosensitizers have been studied for PDTmediated potentiation of chemotherapeutic agents including
Photofrin, Photofrin II, δ-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), meso-

chlorin e6 monoethylene diamine (Mce6), metatetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (m-THPC; Foscan), and indocyanine green
(ICG; ref. 21). The chemotherapeutic agents evaluated were
cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mytomicin C, which mediate cell
death via DNA adducts (21). PDT in combination with these
pharmacologic therapies was shown to enhance tumor destruction and reduce toxicity compared with chemotherapy
alone (21). The optimal treatment sequence, however, was
dependent on the photosensitizer and chemotherapeutic
agents that were used. Cisplatin cytotoxicity was enhanced
most significantly when the chemotherapeutic was administered before Photofrin or ICG-based PDT. Similarly, the
strongest potentiation of mitomycin C efficacy was seen

effective after treatment with Photofrin II, Mce 6 , or
m-THPC–based PDT.
The in vitro 3D platform for micrometastatic OvCa
described here fills a critical niche in translational science
by bridging the gap between resource-intensive animal
models and traditional monolayer cultures that lack important determinants of tumor growth and treatment response.
Consistent with previous findings (12, 45), our results indicate that traditional monolayer cultures significantly overestimate the sensitivity of OvCa cells to cytotoxic treatments,
which limits their value as tools to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. In contrast, tumor reduction in the same cells grown in
3D culture was comparable with results from in vivo studies
(4, 31), which demonstrated that, as in the present study,

9326

multiple rounds of BPD-PDT or rationally designed combinations were necessary to achieve significant therapeutic
benefit. An additional strength of the 3D platform is the demonstrated ability to evaluate dosing schedules over a time
period that more closely mimics in vivo experiments than
monolayer cultures. High-resolution longitudinal imaging of
cytotoxicity in the 3D platform also reveals differential cytotoxic patterns for carboplatin and BPD-PDT on a noduleby-nodule basis that would be impossible to uncover in
monolayer. These capabilities, combined with a system for
high-throughput screening, facilitate rapid optimization of
treatment parameters and allow valuable resources for
in vivo and patient tissue studies to be focused on the most
promising regimens.
The treatment response factors addressed by this system
include interaction of the monotherapies at the subcellular
level and architectural disruption of ovarian nodules by
BPD-PDT, suggesting improved delivery of carboplatin.
Future models will incorporate more complex aspects of
the tumor microenvironment including cocultures with
stromal partners including fibroblasts and endothelial cells.
These cocultures are motivated in part by clinical findings
from Menon and colleagues (46), who showed that nodules
as small as 1 mm (the smallest evaluated in the study)
showed evidence of vascularity in peritoneal malignancies,
including ovarian carcinomatosis. As the authors suggest, it
was not clear if the vasculature in the smallest nodules was
functional or even properly organized (46). It is important to
explore whether endothelial cells, as signaling partners, have
an effect on tumor growth or treatment response, even in the
absence of flow or structural organization. New in vitro
models for ovarian micrometastases using customizable
matrices and stromal cells are being investigated by our
group (47) and others (48, 49) and will play an increasingly
important role in screening combination regimens and
uncovering resistance mechanisms.
Within the context of designing effective multifaceted
treatments for OvCa, PDT-based combination regimens have
been shown to reverse cisplatin resistance (13), to synergistically increase the therapeutic effect of targeted biological
therapies (4), and now to synergistically enhance carboplatin
efficacy for the treatment of multifocal OvCa. These findings
are particularly significant in view of the fact that the highly
toxic therapies currently used to treat metastatic OvCa have
produced only modest improvements in the recurrence rates
and mortality associated with this disease.
In an effort to address this challenge of a narrow therapeutic window, we used doses of BPD-PDT and carboplatin in
this study that were substantially lower than the typical
range used in vivo and in the clinic (24, 34, 42, 44, 50). Keeping in mind the need for well-tolerated treatments, tumor
destruction could be further improved with incremental
and concomitant increases in the doses of both monotherapies. This approach will likely be more successful than significantly increasing either monotherapy to higher and more
toxic levels. Also, in contrast to carboplatin (23, 42, 44),
PDT can be administered in multiple rounds without additive host toxicity (4, 31). This attribute, along with the ability

BPD-PDT + Carboplatin Synergism in a 3D Ovarian Cancer Model

of PDT to sensitize chemoresistant and chemosensitive OvCa
nodules to platinum-based agents (13), highlights the need to
explore the effect of repeatedly treating 3D micronodules
with low-dose BPD-PDT in combination with low-dose
carboplatin. The high throughput capabilities of the platform
described here can be harnessed to evaluate these additional
treatment scenarios and to inform focused preclinical
experiments.
The results and strategies presented here could be used
to design more effective and well-tolerated clinical combination regimens based on previously published studies
using PDT to treat a variety of disseminated peritoneal
malignancies, including ovarian carcinomatosis (14–19).
Phases I and II PDT clinical trials using nonoptimized treatment parameters and Photofrin have shown promise
in treating cytoreduced minimal residual disease and
chemoresistant peritoneal tumors (17). Photofrin-PDT
conferred a survival advantage relative to historical controls
with acute but reversible toxicities. Furthermore, OvCas
were among the most responsive intraabdominal solid
tumors to i.p. PDT (17). Building on these promising findings, we predict that BPD-PDT (which offers significant
pharmacokinetic and photobiological advantages over early
generation photosensitizers; refs. 4, 29–31) in combination
with low-dose carboplatin will be an effective and welltolerated combination regimen.

Collectively, these preclinical and clinical reports indicate
that PDT should be included in the regular armamentarium
used to treat ovarian carcinomatoses as part of a comprehensive treatment plan designed to minimize toxicity with optimal
cytoreductive effects. We envision a scenario in which BPDPDT is used in conjunction with cytoreductive surgery to treat
and sensitize unresectable tumors to chemo-, radio- and
biological therapeutics. Due to the vast library of candidate
interventions, high-throughput 3D treatment response platforms, as presented here, will play a critical role in selecting
the appropriate combination regimens for multifocal OvCa
as well as many other lethal metastatic cancers.
