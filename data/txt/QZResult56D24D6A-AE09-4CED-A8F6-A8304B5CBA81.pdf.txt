Abstract
Metformin inhibits cancer cell proliferation, and epidemiology studies suggest an association with increased
survival in patients with cancer taking metformin; however, the mechanism by which metformin improves cancer
outcomes remains controversial. To explore how metformin might directly affect cancer cells, we analyzed how
metformin altered the metabolism of prostate cancer cells and tumors. We found that metformin decreased
glucose oxidation and increased dependency on reductive glutamine metabolism in both cancer cell lines and in a
mouse model of prostate cancer. Inhibition of glutamine anaplerosis in the presence of metformin further
attenuated proliferation, whereas increasing glutamine metabolism rescued the proliferative defect induced by
metformin. These data suggest that interfering with glutamine may synergize with metformin to improve
outcomes in patients with prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4429–38. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cells
(1–3). Tumor cells adapt their metabolism to provide the
needed quantities of ATP, redox equivalents, and biosynthetic precursors necessary for cell growth and uncontrolled
proliferation (4–6). Individual cancers appear to have distinct metabolic dependencies to sustain growth and prolifAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Chemical Engineering and 2Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; 3Koch Institute for Cancer

eration. Addiction to glutamine (7–9), glucose (1, 10), and
other amino acids (11) have been described, but how to best
target these unique dependencies for therapeutic beneﬁt
remains unknown (12).
One potential approach has focused on targeting speciﬁc
metabolic enzymes including pyruvate kinase (11, 13), lactate
dehydrogenase (14), and glutaminase (15, 16), but the feasibility
of targeting these enzymes in patients with cancer remains
unknown. Metabolism-altering drugs in general, however, have
been used in the clinic and are well-tolerated by humans. For
instance, dichloroacetate, a compound used to treat lactic
acidosis (17), can alter mitochondrial metabolism in human
tumors (18) and can induce death of cancer cells in culture that
fail to adapt to increased pyruvate oxidation (19). The antidiabetic drug metformin is another widely prescribed compound
that can directly impact cell metabolism. Metformin improves
glycemic control in diabetes, at least in part, by modulating
signaling pathways that regulate metabolism in the liver, a
process thought to be mediated though activation of AMPK
(20). How exactly metformin acts as an anti-diabetic agent
remains controversial, but one target of metformin in cells is
mitochondrial complex I (20). Inhibition of this complex by
metformin can induce energy stress as one mechanism of AMPK
activation, leading to reduced rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis.
As the drug is effective and very well-tolerated by patients, it is
among the most widely prescribed anti-diabetic drugs.
Some reports provide evidence that diabetics treated with
metformin have lower-than-expected cancer burden relative to
diabetics taking other agents despite similar glucose control
(21–24), but how metformin accomplishes this is not known
(25). In vitro antineoplastic activity of about 5 mmol/L metformin has been conﬁrmed by many laboratories in a variety of

in model systems. While some activity of biguanides in vivo
may be attributable to systemic effects such as reduction of
insulin levels, there is considerable interest in possible "direct"
effects of these compounds under conditions where sufﬁcient
intracellular drug concentrations are achieved (26). Indeed, the
ability of cancer cells to take up metformin has been challenged
(26). Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown antiproliferative effects of metformin in various cancer cell lines, and in
prostate cancer cells, these metformin effects appear to be
independent of AMPK. Instead metformin appears to activate
p53, leading to subsequent-REDD1 mediated mTOR and cyclin
D1 inhibition (27–29). Yet, in line with other tumor types, it
remains possible that metformin induces antineoplastic activity via direct effects on metabolism. Whether metformin has a
direct effect on prostate cancer cell metabolism is unexplored
and consequently how best to use the antiproliferative effect of
metformin for cancer therapy might be missed.
To understand how to best use metformin in patients with
prostate cancer, we sought to understand whether and how
metformin affects the metabolism of prostate cancer cells. We
found that both glucose and glutamine metabolism are affected by metformin via complex I inhibition. Prostate cancer cells
with higher glucose oxidation appear to be the most sensitive
to metformin. Moreover, we identiﬁed reductive glutamine
metabolism as essential for maintaining modest proliferation
in the presence of metformin, thus suggesting that interruption
of glutamine metabolism may have a synergistic effect with
metformin. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that
metformin also increased reductive glutamine metabolism in
tumors arising in an SV40-driven mouse model of prostate
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture conditions
All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. All experiments were carried out in RPMI (Mediatech), with the exception of Huh7 cells which were cultured
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media, each supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Mediatech). For labeling experiments, FBS was replaced
with dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), and glucose or glutamine was
replaced with U-13C glucose (CLM-1396 Cambridge Isotopes),
U-13C glutamine (605166 Sigma), or 5–13C glutamine (CLM1166 Cambridge Isotopes). Cell lines were treated with metformin or any other small molecule for 3 days in all experiments.
Physiology
Growth rates were determined using a hemocytometer or an
automated cell counter (Nexcelom). To determine uptake and
secretion rates, glucose and lactate concentrations were
detected by a Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC (Waters) with a
Waters 410 Differential Refractometer and a Bio-Rad HPX-87H
column (Bio-Rad). The column was eluted at 50 C with 14
mmol/L of sulfuric acid at a ﬂow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Glutamine
consumption and glutamate secretion were measured with an
YSI 7100MBS (YSI Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Carbon contribution to tricarboxylic acid cycle and
palmitate
Labeled tissue cultures were washed with saline and metabolism was quenched with 20 C cold 70% methanol. After cell
scraping in 70% methanol (containing internal standard norvaline), 20 C cold chloroform was added and the samples were
vortexed at 4 C to extract metabolites. Phase separation was
achieved by centrifugation at 4 C. Methanol phase (polar
metabolites) and chloroform phase (fatty acids) were separated and dried by applying constant air ﬂow. Dried metabolite
samples were stored at 80 C.
Polar metabolite samples were derivatized with methoxyamine (TS-45950 Thermo Scientiﬁc) for 90 minutes at 40 C
and subsequently with N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltriﬂuoroacetamid, with 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane
(375934 Sigma) for 60 minutes at 60 C. Fatty acids were
esteriﬁed with 2% sulfuric acid in methanol for 120 minutes
at 60 C and subsequently extracted with hexane. Isotopomer
distributions of polar metabolites and fatty acids were measured with a 6890N GC system (Agilent Technologies) combined with a 5975B Inert XL MS system (Agilent Technologies).
Isotopomer distributions were analyzed using the MATLABbased software Metran (30–33). Total contribution of carbon
was calculated using the following equation (34):
Total contribution of carbon ¼

Pn

i  mi
i¼0
Pn
i¼0 mi

n

where n gives the number of C atoms in the metabolite, i is the
different mass isotopomers, and m is the abundance of a
certain mass.
Isotopomer distributions of fatty acids were further ﬁtted to
an isotopic spectral analysis model, assuming that the measured mass distribution vectors are a function of the rate of
fatty acid synthesis and contribution of the labeled carbon
source to fatty acids (35, 36).
Net glutamine ﬂux was calculated from glutamine uptake
rates and glutamate secretion rates.
Small molecules for in vitro experiments
Metformin (D5035 Sigma) was dissolved in milliQ water and
applied at concentrations of 0.5 to 2.5 mmol/L. Rotenone
(R8875 Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and applied at concentrations of 10 to 50 ng/mL. BPTES was a
gift from Agios Pharmaceuticals. BPTES and 968 (AG-690
Specs) were dissolved in DMSO and applied at concentrations
of 4 or 8 and 5 or 10 mmol/L, respectively.
TSC2 knockdown and mRNA expression levels
Lentivirus with shRNA against TSC2 (TRCN0000040178,
TRCN0000040181; Sigma) was applied. Control cells were
infected with empty pLKO.1. For quantitative real-time PCR,
RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA
was generated from 1 mg RNA using High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to
manufacturer's protocols. cDNA was analyzed using the Light
Cycler 480 II (Roche) with SYBR Green Master Mix from BioRad. Primers sequences were obtained from Primer Bank (37).

Metformin Increases Dependency on Glutamine Metabolism

Metformin quantiﬁcation
Tumor tissue samples (20–30 mg) were homogenized in
0.9% NaCl using a mortar and pestle and centrifuged (10
minutes, 13,000 rpm). An aliquot of the supernatant was used
for protein determination; in an additional aliquot, metformin
was quantiﬁed. Metformin was quantiﬁed with an Agilent 6460
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent) coupled to an
Agilent 1200 HPLC system. Ionization mode was electrospray
(ESI), polarity positive. Electrospray jetstream conditions were
as follows: capillary voltage 3,500 V, nozzle voltage 1,000 V,
drying gas ﬂow 11 L/min nitrogen, drying gas temperature
350 C, nebulizer pressure 55 psi, sheath gas temperature
350 C, and sheath gas ﬂow 11 L/min. The mass spectrometer
was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode using m/z 130.1 and the product ion m/z 60.1. Dwell
time was 100 ms, the fragmentor was set at 60, and the collision
energy at 10. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) separation was achieved on a HILIC plus column
(50  2.1 mm2 I.D., 3.5 mm particle size; Agilent) using 0.1%
formic acid in water/acetonitrile 20:80 (v/v) as mobile phase at
a ﬂow rate of 0.65 mL/min.
Transgenetic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate
Transgenetic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP)
mice were injected with 3 consecutive intraperitoneal injections (with a 24-hour interval) of vehicle or metformin (300 or
500 mg/kg/d). Metformin was dissolved in PBS, and the vehicle
was PBS. Mice were sacriﬁced 2 hours after the last injection.
Prostate tumor tissue was removed and quenched in liquid
nitrogen. Pulverized tumor tissue was extracted and analyzed
as described above. Metabolite pool sizes were normalized to
analyzed tumor tissue weight. Mass isotopomer distributions
of citrate were normalized to the glutamine enrichment of the
tissue.
All animal experiments were approved by the Committee on
Animal Care at MIT and/or Harvard.
Statistics
Error bars depict SD. R and P values for the depicted
correlations were calculated with the MATLAB integrated
function corrcoef: [R,P] ¼ corrcoef returns P, a matrix of P
values for testing the hypothesis of no correlation. Each P value
is the probability of getting a correlation as large as the
observed value by random chance, when the true correlation
is zero. P values were also calculated for bar graphs using the
Student t test (2-tailed, unequal variance) to determine whether 2 samples are likely to have come from the same 2 underlying
populations that have the same mean.

Results
Metformin decreases proliferation and promotes
glucose fermentation in prostate cancer cell lines
To begin to characterize the effect of metformin on the
metabolism of 3 different prostate cancer cell lines, we
measured proliferation, glucose uptake rate, and lactate
secretion rate in the absence or presence of increasing doses
of metformin. For all 3 cell lines, the decrease in proliferation
observed with increasing metformin concentration was

www.aacrjournals.org

accompanied by an increase in the rate of glucose uptake
and lactate secretion (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the magnitude
of the decrease in proliferation along with the increase in
glucose uptake/lactate secretion was different across all 3
cell lines. LNCaP cells exhibited the greatest response, PC3
cells showed an intermediate response, and DU145 hardly
responded to metformin. In the presence of 2.5 mmol/L
metformin compared with no-treatment, all cell lines displayed an increase in the amount of lactate secretion relative
to glucose uptake, suggesting that a larger percentage of the
glucose is converted to lactate in these cells. However, the
increase in lactate secretion relative to glucose uptake was
different in different cell lines (increase in this ratio for
DU145: 13%  3.9%, PC3: 23%  2.2%, and LNCaP: 49% 
3.0%), suggesting that metformin differently affected carbon
metabolism in these different cell lines. Furthermore, the
degree to which metformin altered glucose metabolism
correlated with the decrease in proliferation rate when cells
were treated with the drug (Fig. 1B).
The metabolic response to metformin is consistent with
mitochondrial complex I inhibition
To understand how metformin inﬂuences glucose metabolism, we ﬁrst asked whether the known action of metformin
as an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I is also observed
in these cells. Complex I is a component of the electron
transport chain that transfers electrons derived from nutrient oxidation to oxygen. To determine whether metformin
affected this process in prostate cancer cells, we measured
oxygen consumption in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of metformin. Metformin inhibited oxygen consumption in a dose-dependent manner in all 3 cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S1), consistent with complex I
inhibition. To determine whether complex I inhibition could
account for the differential metformin sensitivity across the
3 cell lines, we tested the effect of increasing doses of the
established complex I inhibitor rotenone on cell proliferation (Fig. 2A). Rotenone inhibited cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner that varied across cell lines. Consistent
with complex I being involved in metformin toxicity, the
sensitivity of all 3 cell lines to rotenone was the same as that
observed with metformin (i.e., DU145 cells were the least
sensitive, PC3 cell had an intermediate phenotype, and
LNCaP cells were the most sensitive). Moreover, addition
of metformin did not have any further effect on cells treated
with the highest dose of rotenone, supporting the hypothesis
that the antiproliferative effect of metformin is mediated by
complex I inhibition in these cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we
tested whether the correlation between decreased proliferation and increased glucose uptake was also observed with
rotenone treatment. Consistent with a role for complex I
inhibition in altering glucose metabolism in response to
metformin, proliferation, and glucose uptake rates in the
presence of rotenone were highly correlated (Fig. 2B). Finally, we tested whether hypoxia affects metformin sensitivity.
Hypoxic cells are more dependent on glycolysis as an adaptation to low oxygen (38), raising the possibility that hypoxic
cells could be less sensitive to metformin. Indeed we found

that PC3 cells in hypoxia are unaffected by metformin and
that LNCaP cells were much less affected in hypoxia compared with normoxia (Fig. 2C). Together, these data suggest
that complex I inhibition by metformin was responsible for
both altered glucose metabolism and the inhibition of cell
proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines and that the
magnitude of the effect on glucose metabolism is associated
with the ability of metformin to suppress cell proliferation.

nutrient into the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite a-ketoglutarate by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In all cell
lines tested, metformin decreased glucose contribution to
a-ketoglutarate in a dose-dependent manner, whereas glutamine contribution to a-ketoglutarate increased in a reciprocal
pattern (Fig. 3A). As in most cultured cells, glutamine accounted
for the majority of tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon in all 3 lines
tested (39). However, variability in the degree of glucose contribution was observed. Interestingly, the magnitude of glucose
carbon contribution to the tricarboxylic acid cycle was also
correlated with the sensitivity of the cell lines to metformin;
DU145 was the least sensitive to metformin and showed the least
amount of glucose oxidation, PC3 cells had an intermediate
phenotype, and the LNCaP cells displayed the most glucose
oxidation and were most sensitive to metformin (Fig. 3A).
Inhibition of electron transport has been reported to switch
glutamine metabolism from an oxidative to a reductive pathway (40). Consistent with the inhibition of complex I by
metformin in these cells, metformin treatment led to an
increase in reductive glutamine metabolism. This was shown
by an increase in the M þ 5 mass isotopomer of citrate (Fig. 3B)
and further conﬁrmed by measuring the contribution of glutamine labeled with 13C only at the C5 position, to palmitate,
which is lost if glutamine contributes oxidatively to fatty acids.
Metformin increased the reductive contribution of glutamine
to palmitate in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig.
S2), as well as the overall contribution of carbon to the

tricarboxylic acid cycle. These data suggest that complex I
inhibition by metformin decreased glucose entry into the
tricarboxylic acid cycle and subsequently increased glutamine
anaplerosis via reductive carboxylation to citrate. Furthermore, these phenomena track with sensitivity to metformin.
To further conﬁrm that complex I inhibition by metformin
results in the switch from glucose toward additional glutamine
for fueling the tricarboxylic acid cycle, we measured
glutamine contribution to a-ketoglutarate and the reductive
glutamine contribution to palmitate in the presence of rotenone (Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar to metformin, rotenone
increased the contribution of glutamine carbon to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and reductive glutamine contribution to
palmitate, providing further support for the role of complex I
inhibition in the antiproliferative effect for metformin in
prostate cancer cells.
Decreased glutamine ﬂux increases sensitivity to
metformin
We next questioned whether increased glutamine metabolism is an adaptive response to complex I inhibition that might
attenuate the antiproliferative effect of metformin. To test this
hypothesis, we took advantage of the small-molecule inhibitors
968 and BPTES, both of which target glutaminase (refs. 15,
16; Fig. 4A). Glutaminase catalyzes the conversion of glutamine
to glutamate, and the increased activity of this enzyme is at
least partially responsible for elevated glutamine metabolism

in cancer (16, 41). Consistent with increased glutamine metabolism being an adaptive response following metformin treatment, we detected larger decrease in cell number with the
simultaneous administration of metformin and a glutaminase
inhibitor (968 or BPTES) than observed with either metformin
or glutaminase inhibitor acting alone for all 3 cell lines (Fig. 4B;
Supplementary Fig. S4A). The combination of rotenone and
968 produced a similar effect (Fig. 4C). Finally, we tested
whether withdrawal of glutamine from the medium yields
increased metformin sensitivity. As none of the prostate cancer
cell lines proliferate in the absence of glutamine, we used Huh7
liver cancer cells, which have been previously reported to grow
without glutamine (42). Indeed, Huh7 cells cultured without
glutamine displayed a signiﬁcantly increased metformin sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Increased glutamine ﬂux decreases metformin
sensitivity
To test whether increased glutamine ﬂux is sufﬁcient to
limit the antiproliferative effect of metformin, we took
advantage of the recently reported ability of mTOR to
positively regulate net glutamine ﬂux into the tricarboxylic
acid cycle (43). mTOR was activated in these cells by a

4434

Cancer Res; 73(14) July 15, 2013

knockdown of its negative regulator TSC2 (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Net glutamine ﬂux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle
increased in the TSC2-knockdown cell lines by approximately 2-fold (Fig. 5A). In line with the hypothesis that increased
glutamine metabolism mitigated metformin toxicity, cells
with activated mTOR were approximately 3-fold less sensitive to metformin when compared with control cells (Fig.
5B). To further test the importance of glutamine conversion
to a-ketoglutarate as an adaptive response to metformin, we
used a cell-permeable form of a-ketoglutarate, dimethylketoglutarate, in LNCaP cells following drug treatment. In
line with our previous ﬁndings, dimethyl-ketoglutarate supplementation in the presence of metformin increased cell
number by 30% (Supplementary Fig. S5B). These results
suggest that augmenting glutamine metabolism limited the
antiproliferative effect of metformin.
Metabolic alterations triggered by metformin in vivo
match the in vitro response
To test whether our ﬁndings are relevant to tumors in vivo,
we ﬁrst established that metformin reaches prostate tumors in
mice. Using the TRAMP prostate cancer mouse model, we
determined that tumors of mice dosed 3 times with 500 mg/kg

ﬁnding shows that at least some of the metabolic effects of
metformin in vitro are also observed in tumors in vivo.
Finally, we assessed the extent to which reductive glutamine
metabolism was impacted along with glucose metabolism by
the presence of metformin in vivo. To trace glutamine metabolism in tumors, 3 consecutive intraperitoneal injections of

4436

Cancer Res; 73(14) July 15, 2013

uniformly labeled 13C-glutamine were administered to TRAMP
mice treated with metformin or vehicle. Following tumor
harvest the enrichment of M þ 5 citrate was measured in
prostate tumors as a surrogate for reductive glutamine metabolism. We found a signiﬁcant increased enrichment of M þ 5
citrate in different parts of the prostate from metformin
treated animals (Fig. 6C). This increase in M þ 5 citrate
enrichment was accompanied by a decrease in the relative
citrate pool size (Fig. 6D). In conclusion, these data show that
the metabolic effects of metformin in tumor cells in vitro
extend to similar responses in tumors in vivo.

Discussion
The oral anti-diabetic drug metformin is beneﬁcial for at
least a subset of patients with cancer, but whether metformin
can directly affect metabolism in tumor cells was not known.
We systematically dissected the metabolic alterations metformin triggers in prostate cancer cell lines through complex I
inhibition and found that this results in an adaptive increase in
glutamine metabolism (Fig. 7). It is possible that in addition to
the adaptive response in glutamine metabolism described here
in response to metformin, energy homeostasis regulation via
AMPK following metformin treatment further diminishes the
effect of the drug as shown recently for non–small lung
carcinoma (44). Our ﬁnding of an adaptive response in glutamine metabolism also complements a recent study showing
that cell lines grown on glutamine as the major carbon source
are sensitive to metformin (45). The ﬁnding of this study can be
explained by our data, as we show that metformin leads to
reductive glutamine metabolism and consequently leads to a
dramatic decrease in ATP production by the tricarboxylic acid
cycle. Importantly, we additionally show that inhibition of
glutamine metabolism can promote metformin toxicity, suggesting that therapy with an agent that limits glutamine
metabolism may potentiate the effect of metformin.
Our in vivo model showed that mice tolerate metformin at a
dose of 500 mg/kg/d, considerably higher that than the conventional anti-diabetic dose in humans of 20 mg/kg/d, which
led to accumulation of the drug to 60 ng/mg (tissue protein)
in cancer tissue. This exposure level was observed to have in
vivo metabolic effects on prostate tissues that matched our in
vitro data. We show for the ﬁrst time that this is correlated with
effects on cellular carbon metabolism, speciﬁcally a dependency on reductive glutamine metabolism. This ﬁnding suggests that high-dose biguanide exposure might be a method to
therapeutically induce metabolic stress in a subset of tumors,
either alone or in rational combinations. It is important to
recognize, however, that the effect of conventional anti-diabetic metformin doses currently being examined for antineoplastic activity in clinical trials may have a smaller effect on
metabolism. Our work suggests that a dose escalation study of
biguanides may be warranted to determine whether the dose
range with more profound direct effects on cancer metabolism
can safely be administered to humans.
Because the antiproliferative effect of metformin tracks with
its ability to inhibit complex I, and this effect is mitigated by
increased glutamine metabolism, it is possible that cells with a
high dependence on oxidative glucose metabolism and low

metformin and inhibitors of the glutamine pathway might have a therapeutic beneﬁt.

dependence on glutamine metabolism may be most sensitive
to this drug. Whether these ﬁnding will extend to non–prostate
cancer cases remains to be determined. Importantly, these
results do not rule out non-cancer cell–autonomous effects in
patients. However, a direct effect on prostate cancer cells may be
beneﬁcial. Prostate cancer cells, compared with nontransformed prostate epithelium, reactivate aconitase activity leading to increased citrate oxidation (46) and display high rates of
de novo lipid synthesis (47, 48). Since we found that cell lines
displaying an oxidative metabolism were most sensitive to
metformin, the reactivation of citrate oxidation in prostate
tumor tissue may predict a beneﬁcial therapeutic effect of
metformin in prostate cancer therapy. Furthermore, cells adapt
to metformin treatment by increasing reductive glutamine
metabolism, which directly effects the carbon source selection
for fatty acid synthesis. Thus, glutaminase inhibitors, administrated in combination with metformin, might speciﬁcally
enhance the beneﬁcial effects of metformin in cancer treatment.
