Abstract
The retinoblastoma binding protein RBP2 (KDM5A) is a histone demethylase that promotes gastric cancer cell
growth and is enriched in drug-resistant lung cancer cells. In tumor-prone mice lacking the tumor suppressor
gene RB or MEN1, genetic ablation of RBP2 can suppress tumor initiation, but the pathogenic breadth and
mechanistic aspects of this effect relative to human tumors have not been deﬁned. Here, we approached this
question in the context of lung cancer. RBP2 was overexpressed in human lung cancer tissues where its depletion
impaired cell proliferation, motility, migration, invasion, and metastasis. RBP2 oncogenicity relied on its
demethylase and DNA-binding activities. RBP2 upregulated expression of cyclins D1 and E1 while suppressing
the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B), each contributing to RBP2-mediated cell
proliferation. Expression microarray analyses revealed that RBP2 promoted expression of integrin-b1 (ITGB1),
which is implicated in lung cancer metastasis. Mechanistic investigations established that RBP2 bound directly
to the p27, cyclin D1, and ITGB1 promoters and that exogenous expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E1, or ITGB1 was
sufﬁcient to rescue proliferation or migration/invasion, respectively. Taken together, our results establish an
oncogenic role for RBP2 in lung tumorigenesis and progression and uncover novel RBP2 targets mediating this
role. Cancer Res; 73(15); 4711–21. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Retinoblastoma binding protein-2 (RBP2) was originally
identiﬁed as a retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-binding partner
(1). Subsequently, it was shown to participate in transcription
by interacting with TBP, p107 (2), nuclear receptors (3), Myc
(4), Sin3/HDAC (5), Mad1 (6), and RBP-J (7). In 2007, RBP2 was
identiﬁed as a histone demethylase belonging to the JARID
family of histone demethylases, which are able to remove diand trimethyl groups from lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) dependAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Genomics Research Center, 2Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, and 3Institute of Biological Chemistry,

ing on its JmjC domain (8, 9). Therefore, RBP2 is also called
KDM5A or JARID1A. The human JARID1 protein family consists of four members including RBP2/JARID1A, PLU1/JARID1B, SMCX/JARID1C, and SMCY/JARID1D (10). These four
proteins are highly conserved and redundant in demethylation activities. As trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3) is often
associated with promoters of actively transcribed genes (11),
RBP2 is believed to exert its function partly through repressing transcription of its target genes. Nevertheless, RBP2 also
activates genes with less deﬁned mechanisms (4, 8, 9, 12, 13).
Lid, a Drosophila homolog of RBP2, interacts with dMyc and
acts as a dMyc coactivator on its target genes by dMycmediated masking of RBP2 demethylase domain (4). In addition, Lid potentiates an Rpd3 target gene expression by
inhibiting the histone deacetylase activity of Rpd3 (14).
The link of RBP2 to abnormal cell growth is ﬁrst implicated
by its binding to the tumor suppressor Rb (1). It is reported that
Rb promotes cell senescence and differentiation by sequestering RBP2 (15, 16). Studies using RBP2 knockout mice show that
loss of RBP2 prevents tumorigenesis of Rb- or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)-deﬁcient mice (17). The following two ﬁndings further support that RBP2 is oncogenic. First,
RBP2 is found overexpressed in gastric cancer specimens and
RBP2 depletion leads to cell senescence and activation of its
target genes CDKIs (18). Second, RBP2 is required for the
establishment of drug-tolerant lung cancer–initiating cells
(19). These studies highly suggest that RBP2 plays a role in
tumorigenesis. However, the direct evidence is still lacking. It
is not clear whether RBP2 is required for the development of

tumor malignancy. Nor do we understand whether other
downstream target genes than CDKIs contribute to the oncogenic function of RBP2.
Combined with structural and cell-based studies, in 2008, we
identiﬁed that the AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) of RBP2
can recognize speciﬁc DNA sequence CCGCCC and that the
K152 is the critical residue for RBP2 to contact DNA (20). Given
that reduction in global H3K4 methylation is linked to poor
prognosis in patients with lung cancer (21, 22), we set up to
study the role of RBP2 in lung tumorigenesis and cancer
development. In this study, we show that RBP2 was overexpressed in human lung cancer tissues and required for lung
cancer cell proliferation, motility, migration, invasion, and
metastasis. These abilities were further shown to be regulated
by the demethylase and DNA-binding activities of RBP2. Novel
RBP2 downstream targets were explored in this study.

Materials and Methods

PCR (RT-qPCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP),
and DNA primers, please see Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Lung cancer patients
Twenty cancerous and the adjacent normal specimens of
human non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were collected
from patients in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 2003 to
2004 for RBP2 gene expression analysis. Fifteen of them are
adenocarcinoma, three are large cell carcinoma, and two are
either squamous cell carcinoma or pleomorphic carcinoma.
Cell culture, gene knockdown, and rescue
Human NSCLC cell line CL1-5 was established and characterized for its invasiveness by Chu and colleagues (23). Human
NSCLC cell lines H1299 and A549, and human lung ﬁbroblast
cell lines HEL299, WI-38, and MRC-5 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. All three NSCLC and lung
ﬁbroblast cell lines were grown at 37 C with 5% CO2 in RPMI1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) or a-MEM (Gibco) supplemented with
10% FBS (Biological Industries), respectively. For gene knockdown, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones that target to RBP2
(shRBP2 KD1 and shRBP2 KD2) were delivered by lentiviral
infection and siRNA that targets to p27 was transfected by
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at culture
plates 24 hours before addition of lentivirus and 8 mg/mL
polybrene to growth media, and then cultured for another
72 hours. For rescue experiments, 2 mg of shRNA-resistant
wild-type or mutant RBP2 plasmid, integrin b1 (ITGB1)-V5,
CCND1-V5 or CCNE1-HA plasmid, or 40 nmol/L of p27 siRNA
was transfected into RBP2-knocked down H1299 cells for 48
hours using Lipofectamine 2000.
Cell proliferation, soft agar, cell-cycle analysis, and
luciferase assay
Cells were seeded onto culture plates and assayed with a
CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay
Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols.
Cell proliferation was also measured using the Real-Time

4712

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

Cell Analyzer (RTCA) Dual Plate (DP) system (xCELLigence,
Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and shown by cell index as deﬁned in
Roche website. The system monitors cell status using proprietary microelectronic sensor technology. Brieﬂy, cells were
seeded onto E-plate containing RPMI-1640 supplemented with
10% FBS and monitored every 30 minutes. Soft agar assay was
conducted as reported previously (24). For cell-cycle analysis,
cells were trypsinized, ﬁxed with 70% ethanol, stained with 4 mg/
mL propidium iodide for 30 minutes and analyzed using a ﬂow
cytometer (Canto II, BD Biosciences). Luciferase assay was
conducted as reported previously (20).
Xenograﬁc tumor formation
Seven-week-old male nonobese diabetic-severe combined
immunodeﬁcient (NOD-SCID) mice were injected subcutaneously with 1  106 of CL1-5 cells carrying scramble, RBP2 KD1,
or RBP2 KD2 shRNA. Tumor growth and body weight were
monitored twice per week. Tumor volumes were calculated by
the formula l w h/2 (mm3). At day 16 postimplantation, complete autopsy was conducted on each mouse.
Cell tracking in time-lapse video microscopy, wound
healing, cell migration, and invasion
For cell tracking in time-lapse video microscopy, 1  103
CL1-5 cells mock or lentiviral infected with scramble shRNA,
shRBP2 KD1, or shRBP2 KD2 were seeded onto 6-well plates
for 24-hour incubation. Plates were then placed into a culture
chamber with 5% CO2 at 37 C and cells were photographed
under Leica life Image System every 10 minutes for 12 hours.
Cell motility was measured after collection of sequential
time-lapse images. Five cells under each ﬁeld were selected
randomly for tracking and analysis by MetaMorph software
(MDS Analytical Technologies). Wound-healing assay and
Matrigel-based invasion assay were conducted as reported
previously (25). Cell migration and invasion were also measured using the RTCA DP system (xCELLigence) as reported
previously (26).
Tail vein injection for in vivo invasion
The CL1-5 luc2 cell line was developed by infecting CL1-5
cells with lentivirus carrying EF1 promoter-driven ﬁreﬂy
luciferase gene, followed by blasticidin selection. Sevenweek-old female nude mice were injected with CL1-5 luc2
carrying scramble, RBP2 KD1, or RBP2 KD2 shRNA. A total of
5  105 cells in 100 mL of PBS were injected intravenously
via the lateral tail vein. At week 6 postinjection, all mice
were euthanized and their lungs were removed. Luciferase
activity of lung was measured in photos by an IVIS Spectrum
Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). The number of
surface metastases per lung was determined under dissecting microscope.
cDNA microarray
Total RNAs isolated from H1299 cells carrying scramble
shRNA or shRNA targeting RBP2 (RBP2 KD1) were subjected to
reverse transcription, labeling, and hybridization to Affymetrix
human U133 2.0þ chips according to the manufacturer's protocols. Data were analyzed as reported previously (26). Genes

up- or downregulated at least 1.5-fold (log 2) in RBP2-knocked
down cells were selected and classiﬁed by GO ontology. Array
data have been posted at the NCBI GEO database (GEO
accession: GSE41443).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was indicated in each corresponding
ﬁgure legend. All data are mean  SD from 3 independent
assays. All analyses were examined using SAS program version
9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.) and SPSS. P values were calculated from
two-tailed statistical tests. A difference is considered statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Results
RBP2 is overexpressed in human lung cancer tissues and
cell lines
To investigate whether RBP2 has an oncogenic potential in
lung cancer, we ﬁrst analyzed its mRNA and protein levels in
human lung cancer tissues by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RBP2 mRNA was elevated in 17 of
20 human lung cancerous specimens with 11 showing more
than 2 fold increase of RBP2 mRNA level compared with
normal controls (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical staining of
5 human lung cancer specimens further indicated that the level
of RBP2 protein was increased in the tumor region compared
with its adjacent normal tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1). Note

that the samples were diagnosed using hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining. These results are consistent with the oncogenic implication of RBP2 in gastric cancer (18) and in other
cancers analyzed by Oncomine. In agreement with the above
observations, the protein level of RBP2 was upregulated in
lung cancer cell lines CL1-5, H1299, and A549, compared with
normal lung ﬁbroblasts HEL299, WI-38, and MRC-5 (Fig. 1B).
Together, it is believed that RBP2 is overexpressed in human
lung cancer.
RBP2 is required for lung cancer cell proliferation and
xenograft tumor formation
Next, we determined whether RBP2 is necessary for the
proliferation of lung cancer cells by RBP2 knockdown
strategy. Figure 2A shows that RBP2 protein level was greatly
reduced by 2 independent shRNA sequences RBP2 KD1 and
RBP2 KD2 in lung cancer cell CL1-5. Importantly, CL1-5 cells
transfected with these two RBP2 shRNAs grew signiﬁcantly
slower (Fig. 2B), had impaired ability to form colony in soft agar
assays (Fig. 2C), and generated smaller xenograft tumors in
NOD-SCID mice (Fig. 2D), indicating that RBP2 is required for
proliferation, the anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenesis potential of CL1-5 cells. Note that another lung cancer
cell A549 depleted of RBP2 also showed decreased proliferation
rate (Supplementary Fig. S2). Collectively, our in vitro and in
vivo observations support that RBP2 functions as an oncoprotein in lung cancer.

RBP2 is necessary for lung cancer cell migration and
invasion
The potential role of RBP2 in lung cancer metastasis was
explored. First, we investigated whether RBP2 regulates cell
motility. The cell motility/movement from single cell with or
without RBP2 depletion was monitored. The result clearly
showed that the total moving distance per cell was signiﬁcantly
shorter in cells with RBP2 knockdown (Fig. 3A, video in
Supplementary Material). Consistently, wound-healing assays
indicated that fewer cells migrated from the wound edge to the
center space in cells with reduced levels of RBP2 (Fig. 3B).
Importantly, Matrigel-based Transwell assays showed that
RBP2 silencing inhibited cell invasion (Fig. 3C). As we have
shown in Fig. 3A that RBP2 positively regulated cell motility, it
is unlikely that the reduced migration and invasion of RBP2depleted cells was simply due to decreased proliferation of
these cells. Furthermore, we showed by tail vein injection that
the number of surface lung nodules caused by CL1-5 cells
metastasized to lung was decreased when RBP2 was depleted
from cells (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B).
Together, these data indicate that RBP2 likely plays an important role in lung cancer metastasis by facilitating cell motility,
migration, and invasion.
The oncogenic potential of RBP2 depends on its
demethylase and DNA contact activities
So far, our data support a positive role of RBP2 in lung cancer
formation and progression. Given that RBP2 regulates gene
expression through histone demethylation (6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 18)
and DNA contact (20), we asked whether these 2 activities

4714

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

contribute to the oncogenic function of RBP2. To this end, the
cDNA encoding HA-tagged wild-type RBP2 or RBP2-mutant
defective in demethylase activity (H483A) or DNA contact
(K152E) was introduced back to H1299 cells depleted of RBP2
by siRNA (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4). H1299 was used
here for 2 reasons. First, H1299 is a lung cancer cell line with
much better transfection efﬁciency and thus using this cell line
can increase the expression of shRNA-resistant constructs of
RBP2. Second, we need to show the effect observed previously
in Figs. 2 and 3 is universal but not CL1-5–speciﬁc. As shown
in Fig. 4A, the equal expression of the shRNA-resistant RBP2
variants was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis using both
RBP2 and HA antibodies. The effect of the RBP2 mutations on
cell proliferation (Fig. 4B), anchorage-independent growth
(Fig. 4C), and invasion (Fig. 4D) was analyzed. In these three
assays, wild-type RBP2 greatly restored the cancer phenotypes
reduced by RBP2 depletion. Importantly, neither demethylasedead nor DNA-binding mutant achieved the same effect. These
results not only show that the RBP2 knockdown phenotypes
are not off-target effects, but also indicate that the enzymatic
activity and the DNA interaction ability of RBP2 are indispensable for RBP2 to function as an oncoprotein.
RBP2 promotes cell-cycle progression through
activation of cyclins D1 and E1 and repression of p27
To understand how RBP2 promotes cell proliferation, we
analyzed cell-cycle progression of cells with or without RBP2
depletion. As shown in Fig. 5A, RBP2 knockdown increased cell
population in G1 stage, suggesting that RBP2-deﬁcient cells
arrested at G1. To explore the underlying mechanism, we

RBP2 Promotes Lung Tumorigenesis and Cancer Metastasis

examined whether cell-cycle genes, which are involved in G1–S
progression, are affected by RBP2. Consistent to a previous
report analyzing the role of RBP2 in gastric cancer (18), p27
mRNA and protein levels were increased in lung cancer cell line
upon RBP2 depletion (Fig. 5B). Thus, it is likely that p27 is a
common target of RBP2 in different cancer. In sharp contrast
to the same report in which p21 level is upregulated in RBP2depleted gastric cancer cell AGS (18), p21 expression was
downregulated upon RBP2 deletion in two lung cancer cell
lines H1299 and CL1-5 (Supplementary Fig. S5). This suggests
that RBP2 activates p21 expression in lung cancer cells.
Because it is currently not clear how activation of p21, a
putative tumor suppressor in cell-cycle arrest, contributes to
oncogenesis, we decided to temporarily focus on p27 for the
oncogenic function of RBP2. Subsequently, we found that the

www.aacrjournals.org

mRNA and protein levels of cyclins D1 and E1 were decreased
in RBP2-depleted cell H1299 (Fig. 5B), A549 and CL1-5 (Fig.
S6A), suggesting that RBP2 is a positive regulator for G1 cyclin
expression. Regulation of p27, cyclins D1 and E1 by RBP2 was
likely speciﬁc as RBP2 depletion did not alter the expression of
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), such as CDK2, CDK4, and
CDK6 (Fig. 5B).
To determine whether p27, cyclins D1 and E1 are direct or
indirect targets of RBP2, the chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay was applied. The results indicate that RBP2
directly associated with the p27 and cyclin D1 promoters and
the association was enriched in the transcription start site
(TSS) and the 50 -untranslated region (Fig. 5C, left and middle).
Please note that the ChIP signals of RBP2 binding to p27 and
cyclin D1 promoters were speciﬁc as the signals were reduced

in cells depleted of RBP2. In contrast to p27 and cyclin D1,
cyclin E1 promoter did not seem to be bound by RBP2 (Fig. 5C,
right), suggesting that cyclin E1 might be a secondary target of
RBP2. Importantly, the rescue experiments show that adding
back cyclin D1 or E1, but not knocking down p27, partially
regained the growth ability of RBP2-depleted lung cancer cells
(Fig. 5D). It should be noted that neither p27 depletion nor
cyclin D1 or E1 expression altered the proliferation rate of cells
with scramble RNA or vector alone to a degree comparable to
that in RBP2-knocked down cells (data not shown), suggesting
that cyclins D1 and E1 are speciﬁc for RBP2 function. Sufﬁcient
p27 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S6B) did not rescue RBP2
depletion effect is likely because p27 is an upstream regulator
of cyclins D1 and E1. Therefore, it is not easy to reveal the
rescue phenotype of p27 depletion when cyclins D1 and E1 are
both downregulated in RBP2-deﬁcient cells. As RBP2 is known
to regulate promoter activity and we observed that RBP2
bound to the TSS proximal region of p27 gene, a region with
potential p27 gene regulatory function (27), and that RBP2
depletion signiﬁcantly increased the mRNA and protein levels
of p27, we believe that RBP2 very likely binds to and regulates

4716

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

p27 promoter. Together these results suggest that RBP2 may
promote cell proliferation by directly repressing p27 and
activating cyclin D1 and indirectly stimulating cyclin E1
expression.
RBP2 activates ITGB1 for increased lung cancer cell
migration and invasion
To determine the downstream genes responsible for the
role of RBP2 in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis, cDNA
microarray analysis was conducted and the differential gene
expression in H1299 with or without expressing RBP2 shRNA
was compared. Supplementary Table S1 shows the RBP2regulated genes in cell cycle/cell growth/DNA replication,
apoptotic process, cell motility/cell migration/cell–matrix
adhesion/cell–cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, and
Wnt receptor signaling pathway. Among these genes, the
ITGB1 showed a great fold change and so was analyzed further
for its role in RBP2-mediated cell migration and invasion.
ITGB1 has been reported to mediate cell–matrix interaction
(28, 29). First, we showed that, consistent to the microarray
data, RBP2 depletion led to ITGB1 reduction in both mRNA

RBP2 Promotes Lung Tumorigenesis and Cancer Metastasis

and protein levels (Fig. 6A), indicating that RBP2 is a positive
regulator for ITGB1 expression. Moreover, ChIP assays
showed the enriched binding of RBP2 to the proximal promoter of ITGB1, but not hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a or
GATA1 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that RBP2 might facilitate ITGB1
gene expression by directly binding to and regulating
ITGB1 promoter. This hypothesis was further supported by
the reporter assay showing that the ITGB1 promoter-driven

Importantly, reexpression of ITGB1 signiﬁcantly restored
migration and invasion of RBP2-depleted H1299 cells (Fig.

deﬁcient cells either (Supplementary Fig. S7B). These results
indicate that ITGB1 is a direct and speciﬁc downstream
target of RBP2, likely playing a critical role in RBP2-mediated
cancer metastasis.

Discussion
Our current data indicate that the histone demethylase
RBP2 is an oncoprotein overexpressed in lung cancer to
promote cell proliferation, motility, migration, invasion, and
metastasis. Because the oncogenic function of RBP2 could be
observed in three different lung cancer cell lines CL1-5, H1299,
and A549, we believe that the effect is not cell type-speciﬁc. We
also uncovered that RBP2 repressed p27 gene expression,

Figure 6. ITGB1 partially accounts for RBP2-mediated cell migration and invasion. A, RBP2 depletion reduces ITGB1 gene expression. Relative mRNA (left) and
protein (right) levels of RBP2 and ITGB1 were measured in H1299 cells with scramble shRNA or RBP2 shRNAs. The mRNA levels of RBP2 and ITGB1 were
normalized to the level of actin. p84 served as a loading control for Western blot analysis.  , P < 0.05;    , P < 0.001 versus scramble control. B, ChIP
assays show that RBP2 binds to ITGB1 promoter. The chromatin from H1299 cells was incubated with RBP2 or HA antibody, followed by ChIP assays.
RBP2 ChIP results were normalized to the level of HA antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-805). The numbers (4,000, 950, and 270) indicate the positions of the ﬁrst
50 nucleotide of each PCR primers used.   , P < 0.01. C, RBP2 deﬁciency reduces ITGB1 promoter activity. The ITGB1 promoter (979/þ7 bp) reporter and
RL-SV40 plasmid were cotransfected into H1299 cells, followed by luciferase activity assay. The relative ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to the
Renilla activity. D, exogenous ITGB1 expression restores cell migration and invasion reduced by RBP2 depletion. RBP2-depleted H1299 cells were
transfected with vector alone or plasmid expressing ITGB1-v5, followed by analysis of cell migration and invasion by RTCA DP. The statistics were determined
by Student t test in A–C and repeated-measure ANOVA in D. E, a summary diagram of RBP2-regulated genes for lung tumorigenesis and metastasis. Previous
studies have indicated that cyclins/CDKs form complexes that potentiate RB phosphorylation, freeing E2F to activate genes that promote S-phase
progression. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is able to block the activities of cyclin/CDK complexes and therefore stop cell-cycle progression. In
our study, RBP2 was found to increase cyclin D1 but reduce p27 expression via direct binding to these two genes. Moreover, RBP2 indirectly upregulates
cyclin E1 gene expression. In summary, RBP2 likely enhances cell growth through upregulation of speciﬁc cyclins and downregulation of speciﬁc CDK
inhibitors. For metastasis, RBP2 directly binds to ITGB1 gene promoter and increases ITGB1 expression. ITGB1 is a membrane receptor that, together
with speciﬁc integrin a subunit, mediates the interaction of cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). Solid and dotted red lines/arrows indicate that RBP2 directly or
indirectly binds to these genes, respectively.

function of RBP2 requires its CCGCCC contact ability (Fig. 4),

we found that p27, cyclin D1, and ITGB1 promoters all contain
CCGCCC and similar sequences (data not shown).
In this study, we conducted cDNA microarray analysis in
H1299 cells with or without RBP2 depletion. The expression of
a total of 81 genes was altered with at least 1.5-fold change (log
2) upon RBP2 knockdown. Among these genes, 30 genes were

RBP2 Promotes Lung Tumorigenesis and Cancer Metastasis

upregulated and 51 downregulated. In Supplementary Table
S1, we show the microarray-identiﬁed genes participating
in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Indeed, most other genes
regulated by RBP2 (not shown here) are involved in development and differentiation, consistent with previous studies that
indicate that RBP2 plays an important role in differentiation
(10, 13, 15).
Our data in Figs. 5C and 6B show that RBP2 preferentially
bound to the proximal promoter regions of p27, cyclin D1, and
ITGB1. Genome-wide location of RBP2 has been studied in
several different cell types (5, 12, 13, 30). After analyzing these
published data, it was found that, only in the mouse myoblast
cell C2C12 (5), p27 and cyclin D1 are identiﬁed as RBP2 target
genes and RBP2 binds to TSS region and the proximal downstream region to TSS of p27 gene. In contrast, the study did not
show the weak RBP2 binding to the 1,500 bp upstream distal
region of p27 gene as observed in our study (Fig. 5C). In addition,
the pattern of RBP2 binding to cyclin D1 gene in C2C12 cells is
very different from our observation in lung cancer cells. In
C2C12 cells, RBP2 associates with almost all regions examined
(1,134–þ1,146 bp) except proximal regions to TSS (436–
þ805 bp). However, we show that RBP2 bound to 470 bp
region (Fig. 5C). These discrepancies can be explained by several
reasons including cell type speciﬁcity, sequence conservation of
mouse and human genes and variation in methodology, for
example, different antibody and chromatin fragmentation
length, etc.
In our study, RBP2 was found to act as a repressor for
p27 expression but an activator for cyclin D1 and ITGB1
through direct binding to promoters of these genes. As
mentioned in Introduction, because H3K4me3 is an activation epigenetic mark (11), RBP2 is believed to exert its
function as a transcriptional repressor partly through
removing the trimethyl groups from H3K4 of its target genes.
This mechanism very likely contributes to RBP2-mediated
suppression of p27 expression. As for the activator role of
RBP2, although still unclear, Drosophila homolog of RBP2 is
reported to activate gene transcription via dMyc-mediated
masking of RBP2 demethylase domain (4) or by inhibiting
the histone deacetylase activity of Rpd3 (14). Interestingly,
cyclin D1 and ITGB1 promoters both contain E-box elements, potential binding sites for Myc proteins. Whether
similar mechanisms used by Drosophila RBP2 accounts for
mammalian RBP2-mediated activation of cyclin D1 and
ITGB1 is an intriguing question.
Integrins, a group of glycoproteins that consist of a- and
b-subunits and their receptors, mediate the cell–extracellular
matrix interaction, the ﬁrst step of metastasis (31). It is
reported that increased expression of integrins a5, b1, and
b3 correlates with poor survival of patients with early NSCLC
(32). Importantly, integrin b1 is upregulated in geﬁtinib-resistant NSCLC cell line PC9/AB2 for enhanced cell adhesion and
migration and reduction of integrin b1 restores sensitivity of
PC9/AB2 cells to geﬁtinib (33). Our ﬁnding that RBP2 directly
activates integrin b1 expression further suggests that RBP2
is an important factor to mediate cancer metastasis and
drug resistance. Although ITGB1 is also implicated in cell
proliferation (34–36), in our study, ITGB1 could not restore

www.aacrjournals.org

the proliferation defect of RBP2-deﬁcient cells (Supplementary
Fig. S7B). It suggests that ITGB1 does not play a role in RBP2mediated H1299 cell growth. Indeed, a previous study indicated that integrin b1 is not required for the proliferation of vulval
squamous cell carcinoma cells but is important for cell invasion (37).
How RBP2 is upregulated in lung cancer is an intriguing
question. It should be noted that RBP2 has been shown
enriched in the drug-tolerant lung cancer cells challenged by
anticancer drug EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor geﬁtinib (19). However, this cannot explain RBP2 overexpression in
the patients with lung cancer analyzed in the current study as
these patients did not receive prior chemotherapy. Analysis of
the RBP2 promoter indicates that the transcription factor
ELK1 is likely involved in RBP2 overexpression in lung cancer
cells. We generated reporter plasmids containing RBP2 promoter from upstream 1.5 Kb to TSS or its serially deleted
mutants. It was found that the DNA region from 250 to 41
bp (relative to TSS) is the minimal element to activate RBP2
promoter activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis and reporter assay, our unpublished data indicate that ELK1-binding site
is important for RBP2 transcriptional activity. Importantly,
mRNA level of ELK1 is upregulated in lung cancer analyzed in
Oncomine. Whether ELK1 is the key factor leading to RBP2
overexpression in lung cancer is currently under investigation.
Increasing evidence show that the expression of speciﬁc
histone methyltransferases and demethylases is elevated in
several human cancers and their expression participates in cell
proliferation and senescence regulation (38–41). Indeed, misregulation of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes by histone methyltransferases and demethylases has been shown to
associate with various human cancers (42, 43). For example,
PLU1/JARID1B is overexpressed in breast, prostate, and lung
cancers (40, 41, 44, 45) and is involved in silencing tumor
suppressor genes such as 14-3-3-s, CAV1, HOXA5, and BRCA1
(41). These and our current study highly support the importance of epigenetic regulation in cancer.
Lung cancer, especially non–small cell lung cancer, remains to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Development of efﬁcient therapies against lung cancer
is urgent. Our observation that the oncogenic function of
RBP2 depends on the demethylase and DNA-binding activities of RBP2, suggesting that inhibiting these 2 activities
of RBP2 may offer a novel strategy to combat the disease.
Importantly, compromising RBP2 activity will unlikely induce
normal cell death as Klose and colleagues have shown that
RBP2 knockout mice appear to be grossly normal (9). Together, these studies indicate that RBP2 is a potential anti-lung
cancer target.
