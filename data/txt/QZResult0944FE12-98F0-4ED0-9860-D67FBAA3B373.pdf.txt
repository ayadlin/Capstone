BACKGROUND: The risks of both endometrial cancer and postmenopausal breast cancer are increased by obesity and higher endogenous estrogen levels. Although aromatase inhibitors reduce breast cancer incidence, their influence on endometrial cancer is uncertain. METHODS: The authors investigated this issue in a cohort of 17,064 women who were diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive
breast cancer in an integrated group practice health plan. Information on demographics, comorbidities, and the receipt of adjuvant
endocrine therapy was available from electronic medical records and pharmacy records, respectively. Endometrial cancer information
was obtained from the health plan’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-affiliated tumor registry, and rates were compared
across endocrine therapy groups (aromatase inhibitor, n 5 5303; tamoxifen, n 5 5155; switchers: both [n 5 3787] or none [n 5 2819])
using multivariable adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: Endometrial cancer incidence was a statistically significant
48% lower in the aromatase inhibitor group versus the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.87;
P 5.01). Endometrial cancer incidence was 29% lower in the aromatase inhibitor group versus the no endocrine therapy group (hazard
ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.35; P 5.30) and 33% lower in the aromatase inhibitor group versus the tamoxifen group
(hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.06; P 5.08), but neither difference was statistically significant. Associations were
stronger among those with good drug adherence. CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based, integrated health plan setting, endometrial
cancer incidence was lower in women who were receiving an aromatase inhibitor compared with those who were receiving tamoxifen.
In addition, aromatase inhibitors may mitigate the incidence of tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer. Although there were somewhat fewer endometrial cancers in the aromatase inhibitor group versus the no endocrine therapy group, further studies are needed

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer and endometrial cancer are common diseases that share several risk factors. In 2014, over 232,000 breast
cancers and greater than 40,000 deaths from breast cancer are anticipated in the United States. During the same period,
over 52,000 endometrial cancers and greater than 8500 deaths from endometrial cancer also are anticipated.1
Obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m2) substantially increases the risk of developing and dying from both
breast cancer2-5 and endometrial cancer.5-7 In addition, the risk of both endometrial cancer8 and breast cancer9 is
increased in women who have higher endogenous estrogen levels, representing a target for therapeutic intervention.
Given the similar risk factors for breast and endometrial cancers, an intervention with low toxicity that would reduce
the risk of both diseases could provide an attractive chemoprevention option. The potential for breast cancer risk reduction has been realized for breast cancer with the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene10-12 and,
more recently, with the aromatase inhibitors exemestane13 and anastrozole.14 Despite the effectiveness of tamoxifen and
raloxifene in reducing breast cancer incidence, tamoxifen increases endometrial cancers,10 whereas raloxifene, at best, has a
neutral effect on risk,11 and both increase venous thromboembolic events.11,12 Consequently, for primary breast cancer
prevention, because the risk-to-benefit ratio is not favorable, especially for older women and for tamoxifen,15 the use of
these selective estrogen receptor modulators for chemoprevention in clinical practice is extremely limited.16,17
Aromatase inhibitors, which substantially reduce both breast cancer incidence and endogenous estrogen levels, also
potentially could reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. In this regard, adjuvant endocrine therapy trials comparing tamoxifen versus aromatase inhibitors, breast cancer survivors who received aromatase inhibitors had a substantially lower risk of

endometrial cancer compared with those who received tamoxifen.18 Because those were comparisons with tamoxifen, more evidence is needed regarding the influence of
aromatase inhibitors on endometrial cancer in women
without tamoxifen exposure. Therefore, we examined the
risk of endometrial cancer from the receipt of tamoxifen
and aromatase inhibitors in a racially diverse cohort of
nearly 17,064 postmenopausal breast cancer patients who
were members of an integrated health plan. We hypothesized that endometrial cancer incidence would be lower in
those who received aromatase inhibitors only compared
with those who received tamoxifen only, endocrine therapy switchers, and nonusers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A cohort of postmenopausal breast cancer patients was
identified among members of Kaiser Permanente Southern
California (KPSC), a prepaid, nonprofit, integrated group
practice health plan with over 3.2 million members and
5000 physicians providing care at 15 medical centers. Study
data were extracted from electronic health records available
from 1991 to 2010. The study protocol was approved by
the KPSC Institutional Review Board. The methodology
for data generation and analyses in this breast cancer cohort
has been previously described.19 The KPSC/Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results-affiliated cancer registry
was used to assemble the cohort and to determine eligibility, cancer therapy, and endometrial cancer diagnoses. Eligible patients were postmenopausal women who had
estrogen receptor-positive and/or progestin receptorpositive breast cancer (American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM stages 0-IV) diagnosed from 1991 to 2010; who
were followed through December 2011; who had pharmacy
benefits; and who remained continuous health plan members until endometrial cancer diagnosis, health plan disenrollment, or death. Of 28,031 women with breast cancer in
the registry, 3194 who were not active Kaiser Permanente
members 1 year before their breast cancer diagnosis and
7773 who were not postmenopausal were excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 17,064 postmenopausal women.
Computerized KPSC pharmacy data were used to
identify tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor (letrozole,
anastrozole, exemestane) dispensing dates and available
prescriptions to calculate therapy durations. Four drugexposure categories were considered: tamoxifen only,
aromatase inhibitor only, switchers, and nonusers. To be
considered a switcher, at least 6 months each of both tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor were required.
Women who received either of these for <6 months were
considered nonusers. Information on demographics was
2148

collected from the electronic health records. Medication
adherence was estimated from the medication-possession
ratio (MPR), which was calculated as the number of days
supplied (excluding the last refill) divided by the number
of days between the first and last dispense date.20
The administrative and outpatient/inpatient use and
diagnosis files were used to determine patient characteristics, health plan enrollment status, and prevalent and incident comorbidities. Geocoded census data were used to
determine education, and covariant data and death files
were used to determine cause and date of death.
Patient, breast cancer, and treatment characteristics
are described as means, standard deviations, medians, and
ranges for continuous variables and as percentages for
categorized variables for the 4 adjuvant endocrine therapy
groups. Comorbidity status in the year before breast cancer diagnosis was determined using the Deyo adaption of
the Charlson Comorbidity Index.21 The overall incidence
rates (per 1000 women/year) of endometrial cancers were
compared across the endocrine therapy groups. Follow-up
began on the date of breast cancer diagnosis and ended on
the date of the study outcome (endometrial cancer),
death, termination of health plan membership, or study’s
end (December 31, 2013), whichever occurred first. Cox
proportional-hazards models with time-dependent endocrine therapy use status are presented as adjusted hazard
ratios (HRs) for endometrial cancer incidence rates with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). In this way, endocrine
therapies were considered as binary, time-dependent variables (ie, 0 up to the start date and 1 after the start date).
We present the most parsimonious models, with the
final Cox models adjusted for age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race/ethnicity, BMI, geocoded median household
income, hypertension, and chemotherapy. To address the
heterogeneity of endocrine therapy effects, the methods of
Varadhan et al22 were used to examine the association by
subgroups (Table 1). Similarly, to address confounding
by indication, we also conducted sensitivity analyses based
on patients who had been exposed to endocrine therapy
(tamoxifen only, aromatase inhibitors only, and switchers). The Cox multivariable analyses were repeated including only those patients who had an MPR >80% for their
endocrine therapy, which is a standard measure for estimating medication compliance.20
RESULTS
The cohort of breast cancer patients was followed for a
maximum of 21 years (interquartile range, 2.7-9.0 years).

adjuvant endocrine therapy groups were common and
were related mostly to the large sample size (Table 2).
Women in the aromatase inhibitor only and no endocrine
therapy groups more commonly were obese and had more
comorbidity compared with the tamoxifen only group.
Women in the aromatase inhibitor and switcher groups
also were more recently diagnosed with breast cancer and
had shorter follow-up given the later approval date for adjuvant aromatase inhibitor use. Roughly 60% of the tamoxifen only group and 70% of the aromatase inhibitor
group had an MPR 80% (a measurement of good adherence; data not shown).
In general, the tumor characteristics were quite similar in the 4 adjuvant endocrine therapy groups (Table 3).
Breast cancers among women in the aromatase inhibitor
group were diagnosed somewhat more commonly at a
later stage (stage III). Women in the no adjuvant endocrine therapy group were more likely to have ductal carcinoma in situ (stage 0) disease (note that a few women who
initially were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ
[n 5 76] may have received aromatase inhibitors later for
recurrent disease). With those exceptions, there were no
other major differences between groups in breast cancer
stage at diagnosis or primary surgical therapy. Women
who received adjuvant chemotherapy were somewhat
more likely to have received no endocrine therapy compared with those who received tamoxifen only and were
substantially more likely to have received no endocrine

therapy compared with those who received aromatase
inhibitors. Women who received both tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (sequentially) more closely followed the
demographics and breast cancer presentation characteristics of those who received tamoxifen only.
In the cohort of 17,064 women with breast cancer
patients, 148 developed endometrial cancer during the
21-year study period. A small percentage disenrolled
(n 5 2779; 16.3%) from the health plan; however, we
were able to identify the patients who eventually died of
endometrial cancer by linking with the State of California’s death certificate files (n 5 8; these women were
included in the analyses) (Table 1). The endometrial cancer incidence rates according to endocrine therapy group
are outlined in Table 1. The rate of endometrial cancer
was lowest in the aromatase inhibitor only group (0.95 of
1000 person-years), followed by the no endocrine therapy
group (0.98 of 1000 person-years). The greatest endometrial cancer rate was among the tamoxifen only group
(1.83 of 1000 person-years). The Kaplan-Meier curves
(Fig. 1) are consistent with the crude person-year rates
and also indicated the greatest risk of endometrial cancer
in the tamoxifen only group.
In the multivariable-adjusted Cox analyses (Table
4), whereas the endometrial cancer incidence was 36%
higher in the tamoxifen only group compared with the no
endocrine therapy group (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.84-2.22;

Aromatase Inhibitors and Endometrial CA/Chlebowski et al

Analyses based on women who had good adherence
to endocrine therapy (MPR >80%) demonstrated stronger associations. In these sensitivity analyses, women
who received aromatase inhibitors only had an adjusted
HR of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20-0.79) versus tamoxifen only.
The adjusted HR for switchers was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.341.01) versus tamoxifen only (Table 4). The most parsimonious models are presented in Table 4; those variables for
which the HR changed by 10% were retained in the
model (race/ethnicity, age at breast cancer diagnosis,
geocoded income, diabetes, hypertension, and
chemotherapy).
DISCUSSION
In a community-based, integrated health plan setting, the
receipt of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen
for adjuvant endocrine therapy by women with early stage
breast cancer results in substantially fewer endometrial
cancers. In addition, the receipt of aromatase inhibitors
after tamoxifen in a switching strategy may abrogate
the risk of tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer.
Although there were fewer endometrial cancers among
women with breast cancer who received aromatase inhibitors compared with those who were managed without endocrine therapy, further studies are needed for a definitive
assessment of the influence of aromatase inhibitors on the
risk of endometrial cancer. The current findings regarding
the relative influence of aromatase inhibitors compared
with the influence of tamoxifen on endometrial cancer
provide further support for current recommendations23
to include an aromatase inhibitor as a component of
adjuvant management of postmenopausal women with
early stage breast cancer.
The current clinical practice findings reflect and
expand results from randomized clinical trials. In the
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
(NSABP) P-1 prevention trial, tamoxifen significantly
increased endometrial cancers compared with placebo
(HR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.87-6.03).10 During 5 years of therapy in the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study
1 (IBIS-1), a comparable increase in endometrial cancers
with tamoxifen was observed (odds ratio, 3.76; 95% CI,
1.20-15.56; P 5 .011), and no further increase was
reported through 16 years of median follow-up, but
excess endometrial cancer deaths were reported compared
with placebo (5 vs 0 deaths; P 5 .06).24 In the NSABP P2 trial, the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene resulted in fewer endometrial cancers compared with tamoxifen (relative risk, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.360.83).11

In addition, the current results suggesting an aromatase inhibitor effect in abrogating the adverse influence of
tamoxifen on endometrial histology are supported by
findings from randomized adjuvant therapy trials.24 In a
meta-analysis of 5 sequenced therapy trials, the risk of endometrial cancer was substantially lower in women who
were sequenced to receive aromatase inhibitors compared
with those who continued on tamoxifen (odds ratio, 0.31;
P 5 .007).18 In terms of potential mediating mechanisms,
a prospective clinical study indicated that long-term aromatase inhibitor use reversed endometrial thickening
associated with tamoxifen.25
Limited numbers of randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trials have reported the influence of
aromatase inhibitors on endometrial cancer in the settings
of adjuvant breast cancer26 and chemoprevention.13,14
Results from those trials are provided in Table 5.
Although the numbers of patients are limited, the results
suggest a lower incidence of endometrial cancer with aromatase inhibitors than with placebo. Updates of these
findings are anticipated (Table 5).
An intervention that could reduce the risk of both
breast cancer and endometrial cancer would have substantial chemoprevention impact, especially for postmenopausal women who are obese. Currently, >33% of US
adults are obese.27 In the increasing population of US
women with a BMI >35 kg/m2, the risk of endometrial
cancer is approximately 7 times greater than that in
normal-weight women.7 Consequently, because endometrial cancer incidence is usually about 20% of breast cancer incidence,1 such women are at similar risk for
endometrial cancer comparable to their already high
breast cancer risk. Although endometrial cancer commonly is considered to have a favorable prognosis, it is not
a screen-detected cancer and carries substantial 3-year
mortality (range, 15%-20%).28 Thus, obese women,
especially those with a BMI >35 kg/m2, are at extremely
high risk of being diagnosed with and dying from breast
and/or endometrial cancer. Because the number neededto-treat to prevent 1 breast cancer with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane in the Mammary Prevention.3 primary prevention trial was only 26,13 an intervention that
could reduce both breast cancer and endometrial cancer
risk in such a high-risk, obese population could result in a
benefit for substantial numbers of those treated.
Although our findings with regard to the influence
of aromatase inhibitors on the risk of endometrial cancer
in women without tamoxifen exposure are inconclusive,
emerging results suggest a potential inhibitory effect.

of aromatase inhibitors against early stage endometrial
cancer and atypical hyperplasia of the endometrium.29
The aromatase inhibitor letrozole reduced endometrial
hyperplasia in a small clinical study30; and, in a pilot neoadjuvant trial, the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole significantly decreased endometrial cancer proliferation as
measured by Ki-67 expression.31 In addition, aromatase
inhibitors also have exhibited some activity against endometrial cancer in the advanced-disease setting.31-33 In a
Cancer

phase 2 study of 51 patients who had advanced or relapsed
endometrial cancer, in those with estrogen receptorpositive disease who received exemestane (25 mg daily),
the investigators observed a response rate of 10% and lack
of progression after 6 months in 35% of patients.33 Taken
together, such findings support further evaluation of a
potential role for aromatase inhibitors targeting subclinical endometrial cancer in primary prevention settings.
With respect to cost considerations of using aromatase inhibitors for cancer prevention, as a component of
the Affordable Care Act, any preventive intervention
endorsed by the US Preventive Services Task Force has to
be provided by all US health insurance plans without
cost or copay. The US Preventive Services Task Force has
endorsed tamoxifen and raloxifene for breast cancer
risk reduction.34 However, now, with 2 full-scale,

randomized, placebo-controlled trials reporting substantial reductions (between 50% and 65%) in the risk of
breast cancer with the receipt of aromatase inhibitor,13,14
it is likely that aromatase inhibitors will be added to their
recommendations in the near future, at which time cost
will no longer be a factor for individual women.
This study has strengths: The analytic information
were derived from a large population of well characterized
women with breast cancer who received treatment in a
closed health care system with electronic health records,
thus making information available on patient demographics, medical history (including endometrial cancer
risk factors), and comprehensive information on breast
cancer therapy (including the receipt of adjuvant endocrine therapy). The information on endometrial cancer
came from a Kaiser Permanente/Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-affiliated tumor registry. Previous
analyses in this cohort indicated the greatest reduction in
breast cancer recurrence risk in high adherers to aromatase
inhibitor use,19 consistent with recent randomized trial
findings,23 and provide support for the reliability of the
approach to address additional questions. It is noteworthy
that we were able to remove the effect of variable medical
coverage as a source of bias, because all study patients were
part of the KPSC health system and received full pharmacy coverage.
Study limitations included the change in endocrine
therapy use over time, resulting in a shorter period for
those who received aromatase inhibitors alone, and lack of
information on the rationale underlying the individual
therapy choices. However, because aromatase inhibitors
became available in the market in the middle 2000s, we
were able to follow women through 2011.
In conclusion, women with breast cancer experience
fewer endometrial cancers with aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen. In addition, aromatase inhibitors
may mitigate the tamoxifen-associated increase in endometrial cancer. Although a single intervention that could
2154

decrease the high risk of breast cancer and endometrial
cancer in obese, postmenopausal women would address
an unmet need, further study is needed to determine the
influence of aromatase inhibitors on endometrial cancer
in women without tamoxifen exposure.
