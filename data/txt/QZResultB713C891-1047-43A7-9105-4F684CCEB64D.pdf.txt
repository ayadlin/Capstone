Abstract
Pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of human
cancer, is largely resistant to many conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Although many therapeutic approaches focus
on tumor growth, metastasis is a primary factor contributing to
lethality. Therefore, novel therapies to target metastatic invasion could prevent tumor spread and recurrence resulting from
local and distant metastasis. The protein Vav1 is aberrantly
expressed in more than half of pancreatic cancers. Its expression promotes activation of Rac and Cdc42 and leads to
enhanced invasion and migration, as well as increased tumor
cell survival and proliferation, suggesting that Vav1 could be a
potent therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer. The purine
analogue azathioprine, well known for its function as an
anti-inﬂammatory compound, was recently shown to function
by inhibiting Vav1 signaling in immune cells. We therefore

hypothesized that azathioprine could also inhibit Vav1 in
pancreatic tumor cells to reduce its proinvasive functions.
Indeed, we have found that treatment of cultured pancreatic
tumor cells with azathioprine inhibited Vav1-dependent invasive cell migration and matrix degradation, through inhibition
of Rac and Cdc42 signaling. Furthermore, azathioprine treatment decreased metastasis in both xenograft and genetic
mouse models of pancreatic cancer. Strikingly, metastasis was
dramatically reduced in Vav1-expressing tumors arising from
p48Cre/þ, KrasG12D/þ, p53F/þ mice. These inhibitory effects were
mediated through Vav1, as Vav1-negative cell lines and tumors
were largely resistant to azathioprine treatment. These ﬁndings
demonstrate that azathioprine and related compounds could
be potent antimetastatic agents for Vav1-positive pancreatic
tumors. Cancer Res; 75(14); 2907–15. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

utilized as part of cancer treatment. Therefore, targeting invasion
and metastasis of pancreatic tumors should be considered as an
arm of therapeutic plans for treating pancreatic cancer, even in the
absence of detectable metastatic disease (6).
Factors that speciﬁcally promote metastasis by pancreatic
tumors could provide valuable therapeutic targets for minimizing
the spread of pancreatic cancer. The protein Vav1 is aberrantly
expressed in more than half of pancreatic cancers, and its expression correlates with a poor prognosis in patients (7). In cultured
tumor cells and in mouse models, ectopic Vav1 expression
increases invasive cell migration (8, 9), as well as oncogenic
transformation, proliferation, and survival (7, 10). In fact,
Vav1-positive cell lines have become dependent upon Vav1
expression, as siRNA-mediated depletion of Vav1 results in
decreased cell viability and an inhibition of invasive migration.
Vav1 expression is normally restricted to hematopoietic cells,
where it is an important regulator of immune cell development
and activation and is implicated in hematologic malignancies.
Vav1 is an activator of the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, which
are potent regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, through its
function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Rac1and Cdc42-dependent actin cytoskeletal remodeling is a driving
factor in cell migration and invasion, and is a part of the machinery that induces metastatic dissemination. Furthermore, Vav1 is a
dominant signaling molecule downstream of both oncogenic KRas and Src (7, 9). Its ectopic expression, potent proinvasive role,
and dominance to known oncogenes indicate that Vav1 could be a
potent therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.
Azathioprine is a well-established, well-tolerated drug used as an
anti-inﬂammatory agent and immunosuppressant for treatment
of inﬂammatory bowel disease or following transplantation.
Although azathioprine has been used clinically for decades, it

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of human
cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 5% (1). This
poor prognosis is due in large part to late detection, metastatic
invasion, and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.
Indeed, even with treatment with standard chemotherapeutic
agents, the average survival is just 6 to 11 months (2, 3). Therefore,
new therapeutic targets and approaches are necessary to treat this
aggressive tumor type.
Metastasis is a major cause of cancer lethality, accounting for as
many as 90% of cancer-related deaths. Strikingly, recent data
suggest that metastasis occurs very early in the development of
pancreatic cancer, possibly even before the formation of a primary
tumor (4, 5). Although a goal of cytotoxic therapies is to minimize
metastatic tumor growth, therapies speciﬁcally designed to inhibit
the mechanisms of invasion that drive metastasis are not currently

was only recently discovered that a metabolite of azathioprine is a
potent inhibitor of Vav1/Rac (11–13). Azathioprine, which is
converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), is metabolized to 6thio-GTP, which can be loaded onto Rac1 in place of GTP. 6thio-GTP can be hydrolyzed to 6-thio-GDP, but its release is unable
to be catalyzed by Vav exchange factors (11). In primary T cells, this
converted the CD28 stimulatory signal to a proapoptotic signal.
Although the speciﬁcity for the Vav1 GEF was not deﬁned, the
immunosuppressive effects of azathioprine are consistent with the
restricted expression of Vav1 to the immune system.
As azathioprine inhibits Vav1 function in immune cells in
human patients, we hypothesized that azathioprine could attenuate Vav1's proinvasive function in pancreatic cancer cells. The
overall strategy is to test if azathioprine could be an antimetastatic
agent for patients with Vav1-positive tumors. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of Vav1-mediated invasion by azathioprine
signiﬁcantly disrupts metastatic potential. These ﬁndings reveal a
new function for a well-established class of pharmacologic agents
in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfections, and azathioprine treatment
DanG, PANC1, and CFPAC human PDAC cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS; BxPC3, Panc04.03, and L3.6
human PDAC cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS.
The cell lines were obtained from the ATCC or from Dr. Daniel
Billadeau (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) or Dr. Martin FernandezZapico (Mayo Clinic). The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity
of these cell lines reﬂect the genetic diversity of human tumors
(14, 15). CA1D breast cancer cells (Dr. Ruth Lupu, Mayo Clinic)
were maintained in DMEM:F12 50:50 with 5% horse serum.
All cells were supplemented with 100 IU/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin in a 37 C incubator with 5% CO2. RNAi
targeting human Vav1, Rac1, Cdc42, or a nontargeting control
(Dharmacon) were transfected using RNAiMax (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Vav1: 50 -CGUCGAGGUCAAGCACAUU-30 , Rac1: 50 -GAGGAAGAGAAAAUGCCUG30 , Cdc42: 50 -TTCAGCAATGCAGACAATTAA-30 . For cultured
cells, azathioprine (Sigma) was diluted in 0.1 N NaOH to convert
to 6-MP (stock concentration of 5 mmol/L, ﬁnal concentration of
5 mmol/L or 10 mmol/L). Plasmids encoding myc-tagged active
Cdc42 Q61L (Addgene plasmid 12974) or active Rac Q61L
(Addgene plasmid 12983) were kindly provided by Gary Bokoch.
mCherry Vav1 was described previously (8). Mouse Vav1 cDNA
was provided by Dr. Daniel Billadeau (Mayo Clinic).
Migration and invasion assays
For Transwell invasion, PVP-free ﬁlters with 10 mm pores
(Neuroprobe) were coated with 0.1% gelatin. The lower chamber
of a blind-well chamber (Neuroprobe) contained medium with
10% FBS and azathioprine (0 or 5 mmol/L). Cells (2  105) were
plated in the upper chamber in medium containing 0.1% FBS and
azathioprine (0 or 5 mmol/L), and incubated for 20 hours to allow
migration across the ﬁlter. The nuclei on the top and bottom of the
ﬁlter were stained using DAPI and scored to calculate the percentage of cells that invaded across the ﬁlter.
Cell migration was measured using a wound healing assay as
described (8). Cells were grown to conﬂuence on gridded coverslips, and incubated with azathioprine (0 or 5mmol/L) before (30
hours) and after wounding. Cells were imaged at t ¼ 0 and t ¼ 24
hours (t ¼ 7 hours for Panc04.03 cells).

Matrix degradation
Coverslips were coated with Oregon Green-conjugated gelatin
(Invitrogen) as described (16). Cells were pretreated with azathioprine (0 or 5 mmol/L) for 48 hours, then replated on gelatincoated coverslips for 7 hours (DanG) or 24 hours (BxPC3, CFPAC,
CA1D) in the presence or absence of azathioprine. Coverslips
were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and stained for actin using TRITCPhalloidin (Sigma). Fluorescence micrographs were acquired
using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 epiﬂuorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss)
using a 63 objective and a Hamamatsu OrcaII camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) with iVision software. Images were processed
using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe). Adjustments were
applied uniformly to the entire image. The percentage of cells
degrading the matrix was scored. The area of degradation was
quantiﬁed by the segmentation function using the iVision
software.
Immunoblotting
Rac and Cdc42 assays were described previously (8, 9). To verify
knockdowns, cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer [20 mmol/L
Tris pH 8.0, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 15 mmol/L NaF, Complete protease
inhibitors (Roche)]. Mouse tumor samples were lysed in RIPA
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40,
0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 15 mmol/L
NaF, Complete protease inhibitors (Roche)] with sonication.
Protein concentrations of the soluble lysates were determined
by the BCA assay (Pierce), and proteins were resolved by SDSPAGE and immunoblotted using the following primary antibodies: Vav1 (Novus 3A11), Rac1 (Millipore 23A8), Cdc42 (BD
Biosciences), and Actin (Sigma A2066). Secondary antibodies
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Biosource
International. Chemiluminescent signals were detected using
Supersignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescence substrates
(Thermo), and exposure to autoradiography ﬁlm (HyBlot CL).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Metastatic tumor samples (from liver) from human PDAC
patients were provided by the Mayo Clinic SPORE in Pancreatic
Cancer. VAV1 transcript expression in human PDAC samples
was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix (Quanta). RNA was extracted
using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacture's protocol and then puriﬁed using the RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen). Five hundred nanograms of total RNA was reversetranscribed using a High-Capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). A portion of the total cDNA was ampliﬁed by real-time
PCR. Expression was determined using a C1000 Thermal Cycler
(Bio-Rad). 18s rRNA was used as the endogenous control gene.
All reactions including controls were performed in triplicate.
The relative target gene expression was normalized to the
endogenous reference gene (18s rRNA) and determined using
the DCT method. Primer sequences: VAV1 sense: ATGACAGCAGAAGGACTGTAC, antisense: TGCCAAGGCACCAGGGCTCAGCAGTA. 18S sense: AACCCGTTGAACCCCATTCGTGAT, antisense: AGTCAAGTTCGACCGTCTTCTCAG.
Proliferation and survival assays
Cells were seeded at low density, then treated with azathioprine
(0, 5, or 10 mmol/L) for 4 days. The culture medium was then
reserved, and the cells were trypsinized and resuspended in the

reserved medium to retain any dead cells. Cell number and death
were determined by counting on a hemocytometer in the presence
of trypan blue. Alternatively, the cells were treated as described
above and analyzed by the MTS assay (CellTiter96 Aq NonRadioactive Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega).
Animal studies
All animal experiments were conducted with the approval of
the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and in accordance with the requirements of the NIH. All mice were
monitored daily for health and well-being. Female athymic nude
mice used for xenograft models were purchased from Harlan.
Mice to generate the KPC mouse model (p48Cre/þ; KrasG12D;
p53Flox/þ) were provided by Martin Fernandez-Zapico (Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, MN) and were described previously (17–19).
Mice to generate the PDX-Cre; KrasG12D; p53Flox/Flox and PDX-Cre;
KrasG12D; p53Flox/R172H mouse models were provided by Baoan Ji
(Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). For animal experiments, azathioprine was solubilized in 0.1 N NaOH, and then diluted in sterile
D-PBS and sterile ﬁltered. Mice were treated with 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg
body weight azathioprine three times per week via intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection in a volume of 10 mL/g. For the 0 mg/kg group,
mice were injected with D-PBS containing 2 mmol/L NaOH,
the same ﬁnal concentration as the azathioprine solution. No
adverse events were detected due to azathioprine treatment.
Mice were sacriﬁced upon a weight loss of >10% body weight,
or when moribund, by CO2 inhalation or pentobarbital injection
(Fatal Plus).
Xenograft models. For the subcutaneous xenograft model, 5- to 6week-old female athymic nu/nu mice were anesthetized by i.p.
injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and
10  106 DanG or BxPC3 tumor cells resuspended in 100 mL
growth medium were injected into the left ﬂank. Tumors were
allowed to develop over 5 days (DanG) or 25 days (BxPC3) until
reaching a volume of approximately 100 mm3 before commencing azathioprine treatment. Mice were matched for tumor size
for assignment into treatment groups. Tumor volume was measured at the time of azathioprine treatment. For orthotopic
xenograft implantations, 5- to 6-week-old female athymic nu/
nu mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of ketamine and
xylazine, followed by i.p. injection of Buprenex, and 1  106
DanG or L3.6 cells resuspended in 100 mL D-PBS were injected
into the head of the pancreas. Azathioprine treatment commenced 1 week after implantation. Upon necropsy, macroscopic
metastases were scored. The target sample size was based on
prior studies (20).
Genetic models. Male and female p48Creþ/; LSL-KrasG12D/þ;
p53Flox/þ mice on a mixed genetic background were treated with
azathioprine or vehicle three times per week beginning at 5 weeks
of age until sacriﬁce. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment
groups, balancing male and female mice in each group. When
possible, littermates were assigned to different treatment groups.
An initial sample size of 19 was selected to provide 80% power to
detect differences in the number of metastases between drugtreated mice and control mice, based on our preliminary results.
Mice that did not form primary pancreatic tumors (<10%) were
not included in the analysis. In both the orthotopic and genetic
mouse model, upon necropsy, the intestinal mesentery, liver,
spleen, diaphragm, and abdominal cavity were all inspected for

detectable metastatic tumors (1 mm diameter), which were
counted and measured using calipers.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel or
GraphPad Prism. Data are displayed as the mean  SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using the Student t test. For
Kaplan–Meier survival curves, a log-rank test was used. A P value
of 0.05 represented a statistically signiﬁcant difference.

Results
Azathioprine inhibits Vav1 invasion in vitro
The exchange factor Vav1 is aberrantly expressed in more
than half of human pancreatic cancers, and markedly ampliﬁes
the invasive and migratory properties of tumor cells (7–9).
Therefore, we propose that Vav1 is important in promoting
the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Strikingly, in addition to
expression in primary tumors, we have found that Vav1 is also
expressed in metastatic human tumors. Liver metastases from
human PDAC patients were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR.
Aberrant Vav1 expression was found in nearly half of the
tumors tested, with a subset having extremely high expression
of Vav1 (Fig. 1A). These ﬁndings demonstrate Vav1 expression
in metastatic tumors, and are consistent with our ﬁndings that
Vav1 may promote tumor cell invasion. Indeed, depletion of
Vav1 from pancreatic tumor cells completely inhibits invasive
Transwell migration, an in vitro model for metastatic invasion
(Fig. 1B; refs. 8, 9). Based on these ﬁndings and our previous
studies, we tested if inhibition of Vav1 could reduce the
invasive potential of tumors.
Azathioprine is used clinically as an inhibitor of Vav1 in the
immune system (11). Therefore, we hypothesized that azathioprine/6-MP could also be used to inhibit Vav1 function during
invasion and migration in pancreatic cancers. To test this, we ﬁrst
assessed invasion in vitro using a Transwell invasion assay. To
determine if azathioprine was speciﬁc for Vav1, we took advantage of multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines, some of which express
Vav1 (DanG, CFPAC, Panc04.03), and some of which do not
(PANC1, BxPC3, L3.6; Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 7–9). The
cells were pretreated with or without azathioprine for 2 days at
5 mmol/L, a dose that is reported to be physiologically relevant
and comparable with that in patients under azathioprine treatment (12). Azathioprine dramatically reduced Transwell invasion
by DanG, CFPAC, and Panc04.03 cells (Fig. 1C), similar to siRNAmediated depletion of Vav1 (Fig. 1B; ref. 9). In contrast, azathioprine had no effect on Transwell invasion by cell types that do
not express Vav1 (PANC1, BxPC3, or L3.6, Fig. 1D). These ﬁndings
indicate that azathioprine potently inhibits tumor cell invasion
in vitro, and suggest that this may occur in a Vav1-dependent
manner.
Although these ﬁndings correlate azathioprine's antiinvasive
effects with Vav1 status, tumor cell lines contain multiple mutations that may account for a differential sensitivity to azathioprine. Therefore, to directly test if azathioprine regulated Vav1dependent invasion, we manipulated Vav1 expression in one of
the isolated cell lines. PANC1 cells, which do not express Vav1,
were transfected with either mCherry-tagged Vav1 or mCherry
vector, and treated with azathioprine for 2 days before seeding in a
Transwell migration assay. Overexpression of Vav1 signiﬁcantly
increased the invasion of the tumor cells. Importantly, this Vav1-

Azathioprine inhibits Transwell invasion by Vav1-expressing pancreatic tumor cells. A, Vav1 is expressed in metastatic tumors from human PDAC patients.
Quantitative PCR was used to analyze Vav1 transcripts (normalized to 18S) in liver metastases from 35 patients. Vav1 was expressed in nearly half of metastatic
tumors and was highly expressed in a subset of patients. B, depletion of Vav1 inhibits invasive Transwell migration. DanG cells were depleted of Vav1
by siRNA, then Transwell migration was assessed using a blind-well chamber. A representative immunoblot showing Vav1 knockdown is shown. C and D,
Vav1-positive (Panc04.03, DanG, or CFPAC; C) or Vav1-negative (BxPC3, L3.6, PANC1; D) cells were pretreated with vehicle (black bars) or azathioprine
(5 mmol/L, white bars) for 2 days, then seeded in a Transwell invasion assay for 20 hours. Azathioprine reduced invasive migration by the Vav1-positive cells,
but not the Vav1-negative cells. E, PANC1 cells were transfected with empty mCherry vector or mCherry Vav1, treated with vehicle or azathioprine for
2 days, then seeded in a Transwell migration assay. Vav1 expression increased invasive migration of PANC1 cells, and this was completely inhibited by
azathioprine treatment. B–E, the percentage of cells invaded across the ﬁlter was scored and normalized to vehicle-treated cells. Graphed data, mean  SEM

dependent invasion was completely blocked by azathioprine
treatment (Fig. 1E). These data provide strong and direct support
of the premise that azathioprine can inhibit Vav1-mediated
invasive migration of pancreatic tumor cells.
Metastatic invasion requires the remodeling and degradation
of the extracellular matrix for tumor cells to escape from the
primary tumor and invade into a secondary environment. We
have shown that Vav1 contributes to tumor cell invasion
through the formation of matrix-degrading invadopodia (9).
Therefore, we determined if azathioprine could also inhibit
Vav1-dependent matrix degradation. To test this, cells were
plated on a ﬂuorescent gelatin substrate, and degradation was
measured by the loss of ﬂuorescence from the matrix. Azathioprine treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of Vav1positive cells capable of degrading the matrix, and dramatically
reduced the amount of matrix degradation per cell (Fig. 2A–C).
Importantly, we only observed this inhibition in the Vav1expressing cells (DanG, CFPAC), but not in cells that do not
express Vav1 (BxPC3, or the breast cancer cell line CA1D).
Taken together, these data indicate that azathioprine treatment
inhibits Vav1-dependent invasive properties in vitro.
To directly test if azathioprine inhibits matrix degradation
through Vav1, Vav1 expression was attenuated in DanG cells
using siRNA, and the Vav1-knockdown cells were treated with
azathioprine and evaluated for matrix degradation. Treatment of

2910 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

the cells with either azathioprine or Vav1 siRNA signiﬁcantly
reduced the percentage of cells able to degrade the matrix (Fig.
2D and E). However, azathioprine had no further inhibitory effect
in the Vav1-depleted cells. These data indicate that Vav1 is
required for the inhibitory effects of azathioprine on matrix
degradation, and are consistent with azathioprine inhibiting
Vav1-dependent invasion (11).
As an additional component of invasion, we also tested if
azathioprine could inhibit cell migration by using a wound
healing assay. Azathioprine treatment did inhibit migration by
DanG cells, but had no effect on any of the other cell lines tested
(Vav1-positive or Vav1-negative), suggesting that inhibition of
migration is not the primary mechanism by which azathioprine
inhibits tumor cell invasion (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Azathioprine reduces Rac and Cdc42 activation in Vav1expressing pancreatic tumor cells
This study was based on the premise that azathioprine can
inhibit Vav1-dependent Rac activation in primary T cells (11, 12).
Therefore, we tested if azathioprine affected Rac activation in
pancreatic tumor cells. DanG cells were treated with 5 mmol/L
azathioprine for 48 hours, and Rac activation was analyzed using a
p21-binding protein pulldown assay for active Rac/Cdc42.
Indeed, azathioprine treatment caused approximately a 30% to
40% reduction in Rac activation, consistent with previous reports

(Fig. 3A; refs. 11, 12). However, a reduction in Rac activation was
not observed in PANC1 cells, which do not express Vav1 (Fig. 3B).
These data are consistent with the inhibition of Vav1-mediated
Rac activation by azathioprine.
Vav1 regulates invadopodia formation and matrix degradation
through activation of Cdc42, a GTPase related to Rac but with
distinct functional effects (9). However, while 6-thio-GTP binds
to Cdc42, it was not previously found to inhibit Cdc42 activation
in T cells (11). We therefore tested if azathioprine inhibited matrix
degradation through a reduction in the activity of Cdc42. DanG
cells were incubated with 5 mmol/L azathioprine for 48 hours, and
then active Cdc42 was assessed by biochemical pulldown. Similar
to Rac, we observed a 30% to 40% reduction in the amount of
active Cdc42 in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 3C). However, in
Panc1 cells, which do not express Vav1, azathioprine did not
decrease Cdc42 activation (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that, in
addition to regulating Rac activation, azathioprine can also
inhibit Vav1-mediated activation of Cdc42. This likely reﬂects
the role of Vav1 in activating both Rac and Cdc42 in pancreatic
cancer cells, whereas Vav1 may be more speciﬁc for Rac in T cells.

As this effect on Cdc42 was somewhat surprising (11), we used
additional approaches to test the requirement for Cdc42 in
azathioprine-mediated inhibition of matrix degradation. First,
Cdc42 or Rac were depleted in DanG cells by siRNA-mediated
knockdown, followed by incubation with azathioprine for 48
hours before assessing matrix degradation on a ﬂuorescent gelatin
substrate. Knockdown of Cdc42 reduced the percentage of cells
degrading the matrix, similar to azathioprine treatment. However,
azathioprine had no further inhibitory effect on the Cdc42depleted cells, suggesting that Cdc42 is required for azathioprine's
inhibitory effects (Fig. 3E). In contrast, whereas knockdown of Rac
also reduced the percentage of cells degrading matrix, azathioprine treatment further inhibited matrix degradation by 50%,
suggesting that azathioprine's inhibitory effects on matrix degradation are independent of Rac.
Next, we tested if the inhibitory effects of azathioprine could be
overcome by constitutive activation of Cdc42 or Rac. DanG cells
were transfected with an empty vector, active Cdc42 Q61L, or
active Rac1Q61L, and treated with 5 mmol/L azathioprine for 48
hours before plating on the ﬂuorescent gelatin substrate.

Azathioprine reduces activation of Rac and Cdc42 in Vav1-expressing tumor cells. A and B, DanG pancreatic tumor cells, which express Vav1 or PANC1 cells,
which do not express Vav1, were treated with azathioprine (Aza) for 2 days, then Rac activity was assessed by GST-PBD pulldown and immunoblotting for Rac. Levels
of active Rac were quantiﬁed and normalized to total Rac for each sample, and then normalized to the vehicle-treated control cells for each experiment.
C and D, DanG or PANC1 cells were treated as described in A, but immunoblotted for Cdc42 to detect Cdc42 activity. E, DanG cells were transfected with a
nontargeting control siRNA or siRNAs targeting Cdc42 or Rac1, then treated with azathioprine for 2 days before assessing matrix degradation by plating on
ﬂuorescent gelatin for 7 hours. The percentage of cells degrading the matrix was quantiﬁed (n > 100 cells per condition). Knockdowns were veriﬁed by
immunoblotting. F, DanG cells were transfected with empty vector or myc-tagged active Cdc42 Q61L or active Rac Q61L, treated with azathioprine for 2 days, and
plated on a ﬂuorescent gelatin substrate for 7 hours. Transfected cells were visualized by immunoﬂuorescence for the myc epitope tag. The percentage
of cells degrading the matrix was quantiﬁed (n > 100 cells per condition). Graphed data, mean  SEM of at least three independent experiments.

Azathioprine reduced the percentage of cells degrading the matrix,
and this could be completely reversed by the expression of active
Cdc42 Q61L, but not active Rac (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these
data suggest that azathioprine inhibits both Rac and Cdc42 in
pancreatic cancer cells, and that its inhibitory effects on matrix
degradation are mediated through a reduction in Cdc42 activity.
Azathioprine reduces Vav1-dependent metastasis in vivo
These promising results using cultured PDAC cells suggested
that azathioprine inhibits Vav1-dependent matrix degradation
and invasion in vitro. We next extended these ﬁndings to in vivo
models of pancreatic cancer metastasis. First, an orthotopic xenograft model was used using either Vav1 positive (DanG) or Vav1negative (L3.6) cell lines. The pancreatic tumor cells were injected
into the head of the pancreas in athymic nude mice, and the mice
were treated with azathioprine or vehicle control (D-PBS) by i.p.
injection for 3 (DanG) or 4 (L3.6) weeks. Upon necropsy, the
number of macroscopic metastatic lesions was quantiﬁed, with
metastases forming primarily in the intestinal mesentery, but also
on the liver and in the abdominal cavity. Azathioprine treatment
(5 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly reduced the number of metastasis by 50%
compared with the vehicle-treated control (Fig. 4A). In contrast,
azathioprine had no effect on the metastasis of the Vav1-negative
cell line L3.6 (Fig. 4B). Together with the in vitro data described

2912 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

above, these ﬁndings suggest that azathioprine treatment inhibits
Vav1-dependent metastasis of pancreatic tumor cells.
As Vav1 is used clinically to target the immune system, it was
important to evaluate its effects on metastasis in an immunocompetent genetic mouse model of pancreatic cancer. As all of the
experiments to this point have utilized human Vav1, we tested if
mouse Vav1 was similarly sensitive to azathioprine's anti-invasive
effects. PANC1 tumor cells, which do not express Vav1, were
transfected with either a mouse Vav1 cDNA or empty vector,
treated with azathioprine for 3 days, and then seeded in a
Transwell invasion assay. Consistent with human Vav1, overexpression of mouse Vav1 signiﬁcantly increased invasive Transwell migration by the tumor cells. Importantly, this Vav1-dependent invasion was completely blocked by azathioprine treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Therefore, mouse Vav1 can similarly
promote the invasive capability of PDAC cells, and also appears as
sensitive to azathioprine as the human Vav1 protein (Fig. 1E).
We utilized the genetic KPC mouse model (p48Cre/þ; LSLKrasG12D/þ, LSL-p53Flox/þ; refs. 17, 19), and treated these mice
with 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg azathioprine three times weekly beginning
at 5 weeks of age, until the animals became moribund. Upon
necropsy, the number of metastatic lesions was scored. Nearly
90% of the control mice formed macroscopic metastases, again,
primarily to the intestinal mesentery, and occasionally to the liver

(30% of mice) and elsewhere in the abdominal cavity, indicating
that the tumors have invasive capability. Strikingly, treatment
with azathioprine at 5 mg/kg caused a signiﬁcant 50% to 70%
reduction in the number of metastases formed (Fig. 4C and D),
and the number of mice developing metastases was reduced by
40% to 70%. This resulted in improved survival for the azathioprine-treated mice by 2 weeks, particularly at the 10 mg/kg dose
(Fig. 4G).
The central hypothesis of this study is that azathioprine could
be an antimetastatic agent for patients with Vav1-positive tumors,
consistent with our data that azathioprine selectively inhibits
invasion by Vav1-expressing cells. Therefore, we tested the Vav1
expression of the tumors isolated from the KPC mice by immunoblotting lysates from the primary tumor. Vav1 was robustly
expressed in nearly 80% of the tumors formed, consistent with the
ectopic expression of Vav1 in pancreatic cancers (Supplementary
Fig. S3). We next stratiﬁed the metastasis data based on the Vav1
expression of the tumors. Strikingly, when Vav1-positive tumors

www.aacrjournals.org

are considered, azathioprine treatment caused an even more
signiﬁcant reduction of pancreatic cancer metastasis (Fig. 4E).
The number of metastases per mouse was reduced by 70% to 80%,
for both the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg treatment groups. In addition,
the azathioprine-mediated improvement in survival was
enhanced among the mice with Vav1-positive tumors. Treatment
with azathioprine increased survival time by 4 to 5 weeks compared with the control mice, particularly at the 10 mg/kg dose (Fig.
4H). Taken together, these data support the model that azathioprine inhibits Vav1 function in pancreatic tumor cells in culture
and in mice to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell invasion and metastasis and improve survival.
Although azathioprine treatment strongly reduced metastasis,
it did not reduce primary tumor size in the genetic mouse
model of PDAC (Fig. 4F), in the orthotopic mouse model, or in
a ﬂank injection model using DanG (Vav1-positive) or BxPC3
cells (Vav1-negative, Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C). Similar
experiments were conducted using more aggressive mouse

models of pancreatic cancer (PDX-Cre, LSL-KrasG12D/þ, LSLp53Flox/Flox; or PDX-Cre, LSL-KrasG12D/þ, LSL-p53Flox/R172H).
However, these mice formed tumors very rapidly and had a
mean survival time of only 8 weeks, and importantly, did not
develop metastases. Again, azathioprine treatment had no
effect on tumor size, and in this aggressive, rapid model, did
not improve survival time (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E).
Azathioprine treatment did reduce tumor cell proliferation in
vitro, as measured by a reduction in cell number, without a
signiﬁcant increase in cell death. However, this inhibition was
independent of Vav1 status, as both Vav1-positive and Vav1negative cells responded similarly (Supplementary Fig. S5A–
S5C), suggesting this is a Vav1-independent effect of azathioprine. And, importantly, this inhibition did not translate to a
reduction in tumor burden in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S4),
possibly due to limitations in penetration of the desmoplastic
tumor stroma, or due to signals from the supportive tumor
microenvironment. Therefore, these data suggest that the effects
of azathioprine on Vav1-dependent metastasis and survival are
due to its anti-invasive effects, and not due to an effect on cell
proliferation or viability.

Discussion
Vav1 expression drives multiple steps in the tumorigenic and
metastatic process, indicating that it could be a key node for
therapeutic intervention (7–9). Here we extend our basic cell
biologic ﬁndings into preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, and
demonstrate that treatment with the drug azathioprine signiﬁcantly reduced Vav1-dependent tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Although reported as a Vav1/Rac inhibitor, the primary
known mechanism and function of azathioprine has been as an
antimetabolite that suppresses the immune response and inﬂammation. This study reveals a surprising role for azathioprine as an
inhibitor of metastasis, and illustrates the need for basic research
into mechanisms of drug action and into the cell biologic pathways regulating disease states.
Azathioprine has been utilized successfully in the clinical
setting for more than 50 years to treat inﬂammatory disorders,
to treat leukemia, and to suppress the immune system following
transplantation. However, it was unclear how azathioprine could
induce immune-speciﬁc effects. Further, levels of 6-thioguanine
incorporation into the DNA did not appear to be sufﬁcient to
explain its cytotoxic effects (11, 12, 21). The recent ﬁnding that
azathioprine inhibits Vav/Rac signaling was quite surprising, but
is consistent with both the hematopoietic-speciﬁc effects of azathioprine and the hematopoietic expression pattern of Vav1. Our
data are supportive of a model where Vav1 is required for the
inhibitory effects of azathioprine. Other GEFs are still able to
activate Rac and Cdc42 in the presence of azathioprine, consistent
with the remaining Rac/Cdc42 activation following azathioprine
treatment or Vav1 knockdown (Fig. 3; refs. 8, 9). The exchange
action of other GEFs could certainly be inhibited by azathioprine;
however, ectopically expressed Vav1 may be the primary GEF
driving matrix degradation, invasion, and metastasis, thereby
making sensitivity to azathioprine most obvious in the context
of the invading tumor cell.
When used as an immune suppressant or antiinﬂammatory
agent, azathioprine is taken daily by patients for years, and is
reasonably well tolerated. Although side effects such as myelosuppression and pancreatitis may occur in a subset of patients (22,

2914 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

23), these side effects appear less severe than those of current
chemotherapeutic agents, including gemcitabine. In addition, the
well-deﬁned side effects of azathioprine will serve as a valuable
tool in monitoring pancreatic cancer patient response and in
selecting which patient populations would best respond to azathioprine as an antimetastatic agent. Further investigation into the
properties of Vav1 that are speciﬁc to pancreatic cancer cells may
guide the development of more selective agents related to azathioprine to minimize off-target effects.
Azathioprine is used clinically as an anti-inﬂammatory agent.
Inﬂammation is a major factor contributing to the progression
and metastasis of most cancers, including pancreatic cancer (24–
26). Therefore, it is possible that the antimetastatic effects of
azathioprine could be attributed, in part, to its inhibition of the
inﬂammatory response, in addition to inhibition of Vav1's proinvasive function in the isolated tumor cells. Azathioprine likely
also has Vav1-independent mechanisms of action that regulate
invasion (27). It will be important to deﬁne the impact of
azathioprine on inﬂammation associated with pancreatic cancers,
as this could be used to guide its therapeutic applications, particularly for patients with early-stage or precancerous inﬂammatory lesions of the pancreas.
Despite the fact that the metastatic invasion of tumors is the
central cause of cancer death, antimetastatic drugs that speciﬁcally
target mechanisms of invasion are not utilized as part of a
therapeutic program for pancreatic cancer, or any cancer, and are
grossly understudied in preclinical models. Critically, speciﬁc
pharmacologic inhibition of metastasis may not result in a
reduction of primary tumor size, and therefore may not signiﬁcantly alter survival in mice, which become moribund due to the
primary tumor burden (28). This has likely masked the beneﬁcial
effects of potential antimetastatic agents in preclinical models,
where tumor growth is often the primary readout. As such, in
human patients, antimetastatic therapies would need to be used
in combination with a means of targeting the primary tumor, such
as resection or cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation, and
ideally would be coupled with earlier tumor detection. Particularly in PDAC, an additional obstacle to cancer treatment is the
access of chemotherapies into a dense, desmoplastic tumor. This
obstacle could be bypassed by a speciﬁc targeting of metastatic
cells, which generally invade as single cells or clusters. Finally,
some current methods of cancer treatment are associated with an
increase in metastatic dissemination, such as the inﬂammation
following surgical resection or speciﬁc chemotherapeutic agents
(29–31). These ﬁndings further underscore the critical strategy of
blocking metastatic spread as a part of cancer therapy.
As antimetastatic strategies move into clinical trials, it will be
critical to designate which patients would beneﬁt most from
this intervention. Antimetastatics, deﬁned here as agents that
inhibit mechanisms of invasion but that might not affect
primary tumor growth, should be strongly considered for
individuals at early stages of disease, even before detectable
metastasis, and for patients following resection to minimize
further spread or recurrence. For azathioprine speciﬁcally, our
ﬁndings suggest that patients with Vav1-positive pancreatic
tumors would have greatest beneﬁt. However, even patients
with seemingly Vav1-negative primary tumors may develop
metastases from a subset of Vav1-positive cells. Clearly, a more
complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer metastasis will be required to better deﬁne
approaches to inhibit tumor dissemination.
