ABSTRACT
Transcription factors (TFs) are a major class of protein signaling
molecules that play key cellular roles in cancers such as the highly lethal
brain cancer—glioblastoma (GBM). However, the development of specific
TF inhibitors has proved difficult owing to expansive protein-protein
interfaces and the absence of hydrophobic pockets. We uniquely defined the
dimerization surface as an expansive parental pharmacophore comprised
of several regional daughter pharmacophores. We targeted the OLIG2
TF which is essential for GBM survival and growth, we hypothesized that
small molecules able to fit each subpharmacophore would inhibit OLIG2
activation. The most active compound was OLIG2 selective, it entered the
brain, and it exhibited potent anti-GBM activity in cell-based assays and
in pre-clinical mouse orthotopic models. These data suggest that (1) our
multiple pharmacophore approach warrants further investigation, and (2)
our most potent compounds merit detailed pharmacodynamic, biophysical,
and mechanistic characterization for potential preclinical development as
GBM therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

including cancer where TFs can act either as tumor
suppressors or oncogenes [3, 4]. Moreover we have
previously reported that specific TFs can affect genes
related to brain development [5] and potentially impact
post-natal brain developmental disorders. Hence TFs may
represent an important therapeutic target [6-9]. However,
the development of specific inhibitors has proved difficult

Transcription factors (TFs) comprise a large
class of proteins that bind specific DNA regions and
regulate gene expression to control key processes such
as differentiation, the cell cycle, survival, and apoptosis
[1, 2]. TF dysregulation is implicated in many disorders

owing to large TF protein-protein dimerization interfaces,
the absence of hydrophobic pockets, and different TF
conformations between free and dimerized states [10].
Direct inhibition of TFs would ideally involve a
small molecule that sufficiently interferes with TF-DNA
interaction or with TF-activating dimerization [11].
Importantly, these two avenues have led to some success.
For example, a small molecule can inhibit binding of the
TF C/EBPα to DNA [12, 13]. Similarly, compounds have
been shown to inhibit c-Myc/Max heterodimerization and
hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and coactivator p300
(or CREB binding protein) [14-16]. The limited results so
far attained suggest that TFs can potentially be directly
inhibited.
Considering the biological importance of TFs
and their role in the growth and proliferation of cancer
stem-like cells [17-19], novel strategies to design smallmolecule TF inhibitors are needed. In silico modeling
is increasingly being used in rational drug design, but
previous in silico based attempts to design TF inhibitors
have largely failed. Our analyses indicate that this
failure resulted from the erroneous assumption that one
key discrete site is present in the dimerization interface
and that this relatively small locus—termed a binding
“hotspot”— can be relied upon to guide the design
of inhibitory scaffolds [11, 20, 21]. In contrast, our
computational analyses suggested that in actuality the
active TF dimerization surface includes a comparatively
much larger engagement area we define as the parental
pharmacophore, which is in turn comprised of several
distinct daughter pharmacophores (subpharmacophores)
with identifying features. We have previously successfully
applied this multiple pharmacophore concept for defining
ligand-based pharmacophores [22-23] and interface
pharmacophores [24] to drug-candidate development.
We pursued our multiple pharmacophore concept
for the OLIG2 TF dimerization interface. OLIG2 is
a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF that is critical in
tumorigenesis and regulates the survival and expansion of
glioblastoma (GBM) [25-30]. Our objective was to define
the OLIG2 dimerization pharmacophore complex and
search existing chemical structure libraries for compounds
predicted to engage all the daughter pharmacophores.
Such an agent could in principle populate all the essential
elements of the dimerization surface and thus inhibit or
interfere with proper dimerization and TF activation.
We validated this approach by demonstrating the OLIG2
pathway selectivity and potent in vitro anti-GBM activity
of in silico identified compounds.
A key challenge with many transcription factors
including OLIG2 is that high-resolution crystal structures
are not available. However, OLIG2 is known to bind E47,
one of the isoforms of E2A class TFs for which a crystal
structure is resolved [31]. In addition, OLIG2 has close
sequence identity to a number of other TFs that bind the
E2A isoforms, E12 and E47. Based on this information,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we analyzed possible intermolecular contacts between
OLIG2 and E2A isomers, and focused on the NeuroD1 TF,
which has very close sequence identity to OLIG2. Using
the E47-NeuroD1 complex as a template [32], we modeled
OLIG2 and the OLIG2-E47 heterodimer, allowing the
novel definition of a combined pharmacophore hypothesis
comprised of one parental and multiple daughter
pharmacophores.
Here we demonstrate how our combined
pharmacophore guided 3D-structure searches of the
Open NCI Database (http://cactvs.nci.nih.gov/download/
nci/) to identify compounds potentially able to engage
the OLIG2 dimerization surface. Compounds predicted
to engage with all three hypothesized OLIG2 daughter
pharmacophores were screened in vitro against patientderived GBM tumorspheres. We found several small
molecules that potently suppressed the growth of GBM
tumorspheres in vitro, and the most effective candidate,
SKOG102, also markedly attenuated human tumors in
two pre-clinical in vivo GBM models. SKOG102, which
enters the brain after intravenous injection, selectively
modulated downstream OLIG2 targets, and downregulated
stem cell and oligodendrocyte lineage markers to the
same degree as shRNA-mediated OLIG2 knockdown.
These results underscore a potential to pharmacologically
suppress the stem cell-like tumor compartment presumed
to drive GBMs. The data presented herein provide a
basis and impetus for subsequent detailed biophysical
explorations of the nature and timescale of the engagement
of SKOG102 with the OLIG2 transcription factor, in order
to facilitate its optimization as a potential OLIG2 inhibitor
for GBM and other CNS diseases.

RESULTS
Homology modeling to develop a template for
OLIG2 dimerization
In order to model 3D structure and the OLIG2-E47
dimerization interface, homology modeling of OLIG2
was conducted. We also analyzed possible structures
of the heterodimers of E47 with other TFs similar to
OLIG2, included in the alignment shown in Figure 1B
(set of TFs below the dashed rectangle). The general
scheme of the interface between the group containing
E2A isomers and HTF4 TFs (the E2A set) is outlined
by the dashed rectangle in Figure 1B). Based on strong
homology between OLIG2 and NeuroD1, we modeled the
3D structure of the OLIG2-E47 heterodimer (Homology
program, InsightII package, Accelrys, San Diego, CA)
using the crystallographic structure of the NeuroD1-E47
heterodimer as a template (PDB ID: 2ql2; Figure 1A;
[32]). Our modeled OLIG2-E47 dimer structure is
depicted in Figure 2A, with the inset illustrating the

general topology of the heterodimer. This structure
contains unique sequence that can be a basis for assigning
pharmacophore features, and there are three contact areas:
1 and 2 between member monomers and 3 with DNA.
The E47 negative amino-acid residues—aspartic acid
(Asp561), glutamic acid (Glu564 and Glu568) interact
in close proximity with the OLIG2 positive amino-acid
residues lysine (Lys148) and arginine (Arg156) (Figure
2B).
The OLIG2-E47 interface has a unique profile and
is amenable to the design of selective agents, although
there are three conserved negative residues—one aspartic
acid (N3) and two glutamic acid (N1 and N2) residues—
in the E2A group, two positive residues—lysine (P4)
and arginine (P3)—conserved among most of the other
complementary TFs, and a third positive site located
farther in the sequence and conserved in specific sets of
TFs (including P1 and P2) (Figure 2C). All these residues
are marked and outlined by the rectangles on the alignment
depicted in Figure 1B. Based on these data, three
complementary combinations to E47 could be considered
for pharmacophore development and the scheme of the
E47 interface with a complementary TF, including OLIG2,

is shown in Figure 2C. There is evident complementarity
of the negative residues on E47 (N1—N3) to the positive
residues (P1—P4) on the partner TF. Based on this
reasoning three combinations complementary to E47
should be considered for pharmacophore development:
set 1 (S1) OLIG2 or neuroD1 - P2, H1, H2, P4; set 2 (S2)
P1, P3, H1, H2, P4; and set 3 (S3) - P2, P3, H1, H2, P4.
Importantly, two possible positions of less conserved
positive residues for S1 and S2 are not far from each
other in the 3D structure (see Figure 2B and 2D). Their
side chains can have conformations that will bring them
into the attracting energy distance as exemplified by the
negative residue Glu568 (N1) belonging to E47 interacting
with the residue Arg156 (P2) (see Figure 2B and 2C).
Figure 2D shows a pharmacophore model developed using
the aforementioned considerations.

to E47 and this approach was used to define
pharmacophores for OLIG2. Here the combination of
interactions for group S2 includes five interactions: three
negative-positive and two hydrophobic, which could be
covered with S1 and S3. Hence the pharmacophore for
S2 can be considered as parental and the rest as daughter
pharmacophores. TFs similar to OLIG2 (see Figure 1) can
be separated into three sets depending on their sequences
(see previous section); so a daughter pharmacophore for
each set can be developed. The purple spheres shown in
Figure 3A and 3C represent cationic/donor features, while
the green spheres denote hydrophobic features of the
pharmacophore. The parental five-feature pharmacophore

Subpharmacophores (daughter pharmacophores)
Binding E47 with TFs corresponding to the sets S1
and S3 is directed only by two positive-negative contacts
of all three such possible contacts in each case. So we
created a set of four-feature daughter pharmacophore
hypotheses containing the various combinations of pairs
of cationic/donor features with the same two hydrophobic
regions (Figure 3A). Using the set of daughter
pharmacophores derived from a parental pharmacophore
and having a smaller number of features allows decreasing

organization leads to the definition of the main features of four pharmacophores including the parental and 3 daughters: Pharmacophore
0 (five features, parental): P1 or P2; H1; P3; H2; P4; Pharmacophore 1 (daughter, four features): P1 orP2; H1; H2; P4 (OLIG2 and
similar); Pharmacophore 2 (daughter, four features): P1 or P2; H1; P3; H2; Pharmacophore 3 (daughter, four features): H1; P3; H2; P4. D.

respectively. The four-set Venn diagram in Figure 3B
reveals that there are 147 compounds theoretically
predicted to fit the 4-of-5 features of the parental and all
features of daughter pharmacophores. It is noteworthy
that the compounds selected from the Open NCI Database
set, which showed the most potent activity in subsequent
GBM cell-based screens, were mainly those that were
predicted to fit all hypothesized pharmacophores. Figure
3C shows the possible configurations of two selected
compounds that fit all four-feature subpharmacophores.
Both of these compounds exhibited comparatively potent
anti-GBM activity.

Pharmacophore-guided structure similarity
searches of conformational databases
The parental and daughter pharmacophores were
used to virtually search our conformational databases
derived from the Open NCI Chemical Structure Database
(release 3, accessed April 2012) of 260,071 compounds.
We excluded compounds with molecular weight > 600
Da and of these the search yielded 1840 compounds
(1.3% hit rate) predicted to fit 4 of 5 features belonging
to the parental pharmacophore. Subsequent searches
based on the 3 daughter pharmacophores, utilizing 4
features, yielded sets of 545, 273, and 1312 compounds,
termed group-1 (gr1), group-2 (gr2), and group-3 (gr3),

pharmacophore-based predictions and for the subsequent
development as GBM therapeutics. The compounds that fit
all our 4-feature pharmacophores were clustered into five
discrete structural class clusters (A—E), such that each of
the cluster classes consisted of at least five compounds,
and 76 compounds deemed tractable were included in
these clusters (Dataset S1). Descriptions of structural
classes were given below:
Cluster A—Includes 23 compounds that have the
quininoline moiety in common. These compounds are
frequently asymmetric, having an aliphatic or alicyclic tail
terminating in a substituted amino group.
Cluster B—Contains 26 compounds all of which are
either aromatic amides or ureas and most frequently have
terminal dihydroimidazole ring structures.
Cluster C—All 5 compounds from this cluster
can be classified as polyphenolic and are terminated by
trisubstituted amino groups.
Cluster D—All 16 compounds in this cluster
have either terminal substituted guanidine groups or
disubstituted guanidine groups in the center of the
molecules.

In vitro anti-GBM activity of candidate compounds
Twenty-two compounds of the 95 tested exhibited
considerable potency against GBM cells in vitro, and were
screened initially using tumorigenic Ink4a/arf EGFR-VIII
mouse glioma stem cells because these cells express high
levels of OLIG2 [33]. The results reveal that the predictive
performance of the multiple pharmacophore approach
was 23.16%. Figure 4 shows the representative clusters of
structurally related compounds and their associated IC50
data, and the figure reveals that the compound identified
as SKOG102 exhibited the greatest potency. SKOG102

lines that are routinely cultured as tumorspheres (Figures
5A and 5B). These GBM tumorspheres are propagated
from GBM stem-like cells isolated from primary patient
material and are highly representative of the phenotypic
heterogeneity, compartmentalization, and behavior of the
original tumors [26-28].

As a further indication of compound selectivity
we examined whether the expression of direct genetic
targets of OLIG2 varied with inhibitor dose. Escalating
doses of SKOG102 caused p21 RNA to increase in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A). In addition we tested
one compound from each cluster: SKOG145 (cluster
A), SKOG109 (cluster B), SKOG108 (cluster C), and
SKOG142 (cluster E)—on GBM4 cells to analyze p21
gene expression, where the OLIG2 inhibitor was added
in escalating doses. As with SKOG102, the levels of
p21 increased in a dose dependent manner (Figure S 2).
Conversely to p21, OMG is upregulated by OLIG2 and we
found that SKOG102 caused OMG RNA levels in GBM4
to decline, again in a dose dependent manner (Figure 6B).
We asked whether the current front line GBM therapeutic
Temolozomide (TMZ), which is a general DNA alkylating
agent, would have any effect on p21 and OMG expression.
Both 1 μM and 100 μM TMZ had a negligible effect on
p21 and OMG expression in GBM4 cells (Figure 6C).

Lead inhibitor compound selectivity for OLIG2
The lead compound SKOG102 exerted potent
cytotoxicity only in those cell lines expressing OLIG2,
suggesting that it acted primarily via the OLIG2 pathway.
Western blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that GBM4/8
cells expressed significantly more OLIG2 than U87 cells
while normal human astrocytes (NHA) expressed no
OLIG2 (Figure 5C and Figure S 1). The plots in Figure 5D
clearly show that the IC50 of SKOG102 in GBM4/8 cells
was much lower than in U87 cells. Additionally, NHA
required a very high dose of the inhibitor for toxicity to
appear.

for the lanes shown in the figure. D. The GBM4/8 GBM lines express OLIG2 and exhibit an IC50 between 1 and 2 μM. U87 cells, which
express much less OLIG2 than GBM4/8 cells, were also suppressed, but a roughly 7-fold higher dose was needed. NHA, which express no
detectable OLIG2, had an IC50 of about 20 fold greater than GBM4 cells. All samples run in duplicate. Error bars represent mean ± standard

The clear implication is that SKOG102 acts via a different
pathway than TMZ, and this is important because as
is well known in the field, TMZ is the front line GBM
therapeutic and hence new therapeutics should avoid
redundancy. Using a p21 promoter luciferase reporter we
observed SKOG102 increased expression of the reporter
expression, indicating that SKOG102 directly affects
OLIG2 function (Figure 6D). SKOG102 derepressed
OLIG2 mediated repression of luciferase activity in a
p21 reporter assay strongly suggesting that the OLIG2
inhibitor compound specifically targets OLIG2 pathway
(Figure 6D).
To further profile OLIG2 engagement by SKOG102
we sought to determine whether SKOG102 is directly
engaging OLIG2 and interferes with the ability of
OLIG2 to bind DNA. For a determination of SKOG102
- OLIG2 engagement we employed a thermal shift assay.
The protein purity was confirmed by a third party (Blue
Sky Inc.) (Figure S 3) and the stability profile for Histag OLIG2 protein was calculated, (Figure S 4), and we
then performed the thermal shift assay using His-tag

purified OLIG2 protein and SKOG102. Shifts in melting
temperature of the protein without and with the SKOG102
are summarized in Table1 and melting curves are shown
(Figure S 5). OLIG2 displays a significant shift in Tm
in response to increasing concentrations of the inhibitor
SKOG102. At 12.5 μM, Tm shifted by 4.1°C with a single
minimum. At 25.0 μM, a second minimum emerged
indicating a new population of inhibitor-stabilized protein,
with an average ΔTm of 7.5°C. At 50 μM, all of the protein
is saturated with the inhibitor displaying ΔTm of 12.0°C.
Transition of the protein melting profile from low to high
Tm suggests stabilization of the protein structure by the
inhibitor. The calculated affinity of SKOG102 interaction
with OLIG2 at the highest saturating concentration is 56
nM. Importantly, this study was not intended to elucidate
the role of E47:OLIG2 binding, but rather the aim was
to disrupt the OLIG2 pathway by interfering with the
behavior of OLIG2.
We determined whether SKOG102 impacts
OLIG2 DNA binding ability. This was pursued via an
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Patient-

derived GBM8 cells were treated with SKOG102
or vehicle alone. Nuclear extracts were isolated and
examined for binding to DNA harboring an OLIG2
consensus motif. SKOG102 treatment abrogated proteinDNA interaction (Figure 7A). Surprisingly, we observed a
decrease in serine phosphorylated OLIG2 and total OLIG2
protein levels in SKOG102 treated patient-derived cells
(Figure 7B). E47 protein levels were not decreased in the
nuclear fraction of SKOG102 treated cells demonstrating
specificity of SKOG102 to OLIG2 (Figure 7B).

These two treatments similarly affected the expression
of stem cell markers nestin and CD133, and multiple
oligodendrocyte lineage markers 2’,3’-cyclic-nucleotide
3’-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), myelin-basic protein
(MBP), oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMG), and
proteolipid protein 1 (plp1) (Figures S 7 and S 8). These
results suggest a potential for OLIG2 inhibitors such as
SKOG102 to differentiate the GBM cancer stem-like
cellular compartment to a state in which it is less capable
of promoting tumor survival and expansion.

The goal here was to determine whether OLIG2
inhibition could suppress the cancer stem cells that
drive GMB initiation and expansion. Patient derived
cancer stem cell tumorspheres grown in vitro had
OLIG2 either knocked down with shRNA (Figure S

In this part of the study we sought to determine
whether pharmacologic OLIG2 inhibition could
potentially suppress GBM expansion in vivo. Initially we
performed xenograft flank tumor experiments in which

class I—SKOG102—at 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg was
performed biweekly for three weeks and the 20 mg dose
significantly attenuated tumor growth (Figure 7C). The
key observation is that the highest dose, 20 mg, has a
marked effect on tumor size.
Next we extended the in vivo studies to a GBM
patient derived cancer stem cell (GBM4 line) based
orthotopic model that accurately emulates the invasive
natural history of the human disease. First we sought to
confirm that SKOG102 could enter the brain so a test
dose of 5 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally into intact
balb/c mice, so at 1 and 4 hours the plasma and brain
concentration of SKOG102 was determined using LCMass spec. The compound did accumulate in the tumor
(Figure S 9) even over a relatively brief time period and
the plasma and brain concentrations were almost identical
at 4 hours after injection (Figure 7D), while extrapolation
to higher doses and regimens with multiple dosing (15
injections of 100 mg/kg) suggests that a potent therapeutic
dose can be attained, ≈ 12.6 μM in which proliferation
was suppressed by almost 90% (Figure 4B; cluster D).
After the dosing study equal numbers of GBM4 cells
pretreated with SKOG102 or vehicle control (DMSO)
were inoculated into the right frontal cortex of NSG
SCID mice. After 4 weeks MRI volumetry showed that
SKOG102 pretreated cells formed tumors that were on
average 50% smaller than vehicle control treated cells
(Figures 7E and 7F). It should be note at this juncture that
knockdowns of OLIG2 are lethal, particularly in patient
derived lines, which makes rescue study not possible. We
employed OLIG2 siRNA and SKOG102 neither of which
are technically amenable to rescue studies.

In view of the foregoing we introduced the concept
of a “combined pharmacophore hypotheses,” which is
embodied by a computationally derived set comprised
of a “parental pharmacophore” and multiple “daughter
pharmacophores.” A set of combined pharmacophores
was used to search in silico libraries including the NCI
open database, for single structures able to engage all
proposed pharmacophores and thus reasonably selectively
populate the OLIG2 dimerization surface at enough points
to effectively disrupt OLIG2 function. This methodology
could potentially be generalized to various TFs and
other protein-protein interface targets. Importantly in
this context, our work elucidated the salient features not
only of the OLIG2-E47 interface, but also of a number of
bHLH heterodimers having OLIG2-E47 related sequences
and structural identities. Notwithstanding, it is important
to recognize that our modeling assumed that OLIG2 was in
a dimerized state and bound to DNA. Therefore precisely
at what point in the dimerization and DNA binding
steps SKOG102 and other identified candidates engage
OLIG2, and whether this is a permanent or transient
interaction, is unknown and will likely complicate studies
of OLIG2 - SKOG102 binding. Pertinent biophysical
and X-ray crystallographic studies are planned but these
will be of a comprehensive long-term nature, and as such
were considered to be beyond the scope of the present
exploratory report.
We validated the combined pharmacophore approach
by an array of methods including, (1) quantifying the antitumor cell potency of in silico identified compounds with
cultured human GBM cell lines, (2) demonstrating that cell
lines expressing OLIG2 showed a relatively much greater
susceptibility to the OLIG2 inhibitor, and (3) showing
selective inhibition of OLIG2 by measuring OLIG2 target
gene effects by quantitative RT-PCR, reporter assays, a
thermal shift assay, and EMSA. Importantly, both the
flank tumor study and the orthotopic study showed that
SKOG102 treatment reduced tumor growth by more than
50% compared with controls. In the flank tumor studies
we only used 20 mg/kg of SKOG102 and did not escalate
the dose to higher levels. We were looking for activity, and
considering that the current GBM front line agent TMZ is
given on the order of 250 - 400 mg/kg, achieving a 50%
reduction in tumor size with 20 mg/kg of SKOG102 is
noteworthy. Moreover for the orthotopic model in which
the tumorspheres received only one round of SKOG102
before implantation there was also a 50% reduction in
tumor size which is impressive considering that the tumors
were not exposed to SKOG102 after being implanted.
Our combined pharmacophore approach is
potentially applicable to other TFs, a class of proteins
that has generally proved very difficult to selectively
inhibit with small molecule scaffold designs. The
data presented herein warrants subsequent long-term,
detailed biophysical and mechanistic determinations of
precisely how the most potent compounds we identified

DISCUSSION
The
development
of
protein
interface
pharmacophores has thus far proved virtually intractable
and this reality has limited the development of TF
inhibitors [34]. The challenge involved with TFs is
particularly evident when compared with most typical
drug-design scenarios, which usually involve designing
so-called “pocket” inhibitors that fit within the welldefined boundaries of a protein pocket within a target
protein. Such a pocket constrains the possible positions of
the prototype compound, critical reference points relating
to shape, and all necessary pharmacophore features
corresponding to the residues of the pocket. In contrast,
large protein-protein interfaces such as those presented by
TFs contain no such boundaries and no shape limitations.
The involved protein surfaces are wide open in terms of
a solution and have a comparatively “flat” shape that is
not amenable to selectivity of peptide or small molecule
inhibitors [10].

cause OLIG2-selective dysfunction. In future studies
it would be of interest to characterize GBM stem-like
cells and their phenotypic response to OLIG2 inhibition.
SKOG102 and other compounds that exhibited anti-GBM
activity are chemically tractable and suitable for structural
modification to (1) enhance OLIG2 selectivity which may
be important as other targets in addition to OLIG2 may
be variously engaged by SKOG102 in its current form,
and (2) optimize pharmacokinetics and the toxicity profile
of SKOG102, and assess its survival extending effect,
in order to pursue the development of this scaffold as a
potential GBM and CNS therapeutic.

Culture and assay system
Ink4a/arf EGFR-VIII mouse cells and U87 human
GBM cells were cultured in DMEM medium with
10% FBS. GBM4 and GBM8 patient-derived tumor
neurosphere lines were cultured in stem cell medium
supplemented with FGF and EGF. Primary normal human
astrocytes (NHA) were cultured in astrocyte medium (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) with EGF. Cytotoxicity
of the compounds was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction
assay (for Ink4a/arf EGFR-VIII cells) as described earlier
[42] or by Alamar Blue assay (for all other cell types).
For GBM4, GBM8, U87, and NHA cell lines,
viability was quantified by Alamar Blue Assay. In this
assay, cells were treated with inhibitor compounds as
described and Alamar Blue added after 72 h. Emission
values at 590 nm were measured after the addition of
Alamar Blue. Dose-response curves for MTT assays and
Alamar Blue Assays were plotted and IC50 values were
calculated by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism
Software, Inc., La Jolla, Calif.).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Homology and pharmacophore modeling
As the first step in our analyses, we selected TFs
that bind to E2A isoforms using the APID program
[35]. The sequences of the selected TFs were aligned
with the program Clustal W 2.1 [36]. The next step
involved preparing a homology model of OLIG2 and
its heterodimer with E47, using the InsightII package
(Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). As a basis for this modeling,
we used the known structure of the E47-NeuroD1 dimer
(PDB ID 2ql2). We modeled only the specified region
of interest in OLIG2 that was previously selected on the
basis of alignment (Figure 1A). In this region the sequence
homology of OLIG2 to NeuroD1 was found to be ~55%
using the homology module of InsightII® modeling
software. The resultant modeled OLIG2-E47 structure
then underwent 10,000 iterations according to molecular
mechanics minimization using the Discover program
(Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.).
Our parental pharmacophore hypothesis included
two hydrophobic and three cationic/donor features. Based
on this hypothesis, three different four-feature daughter
hypotheses were designed, each of them containing the
same two hydrophobes and different combinations of two
of three cations/donors.
The Open NCI Database (http://cactvs.nci.nih.
gov/download/nci/) release 3 (260,071), containing 3D
structures of over 250,000 compounds was searched for
compounds that would fit all pharmacophores to create
the four-set Venn diagram, using the VENNY server [37].
Fingerprints for the compounds from the intersection
zone common to all four sets were calculated and the
compounds were clustered using the similarity method
(MOE Fingerprints module). Then we applied nearestneighbor Jarvis-Patrick clustering with similarity (S)
and overlap (O) parameters: SO = 0.45 [38, 39], and
the Tanimoto coefficient, as similarity metrics to create
compound structural classes [40, 41].

Chemosensitivity of GBM neurospheres
GBM4 cells were plated in 96-well plates and
cultured as neurospheres [43]. The active compound
SKOG102[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4-((1-ethyl-3piperidyl)amino)-6-methyl-2-pyrimidinyl)guanidine]
was added at varying concentrations 12 h after plating.
Neurospheres were viewed and photographed under Nikon
microscope 4× objective after 72 h of incubation.

Quantitation of OLIG2 and OLIG2-target mRNA
expression
Cancer stem-like cells were isolated from patient
GBM tissue samples and cultured in NSA proliferation
medium (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada).
After 72 hour incubation with control shRNA or OLIG2
shRNA, or after 12 h of incubation with DMSO control
or OLIG2 inhibitor compound or temezolomide, cells
were harvested and mRNA was extracted with the AllPrep
DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). This
was followed by cDNA synthesis using the iScript
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Inc., Hercules, CA). To
investigate single-gene expression patterns, individual
gene primers were identified in the PrimerBank database
(http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) and then were
purchased from Allele Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (San Diego, CA). SYBR Green Real Time PCR
master mixes were purchased from Roche Corporation
(Roche New Jersey, Nutley, N.J. or Roche Madison,

primers specific for human OLIG2, p21, OMG, CD133,
Nestin, MBP, CNPase, and PLP1 genes. Individual

β-Actin. OLIG2 expression in U87 cells, normal human
astrocytes, GBM4, and GBM8 cells was quantified by
immunoblottingwith OLIG2 antibody (kindly provided

for 20 hrs. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were
then isolated using ActiveMotif Nuclear Extraction
Kit (Cat No. 40010). Nuclear extracts were used for
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). To detect
Olig2 binding DNA the Gelshift Chemiluminescent
EMSA Kit from ActiveMotif was used (Cat No. 37341).
The 27 bp oligonucleotide sequence (sense strand
5’-gctcagagcccagctgctggactgagc -3’) with Olig2 binding
site (bold and underlined) was synthesized by IDT and
contained a biotin tag at the 5’terminus of both strands.
EMSA was performed according to kit instructions;
nuclear extract (5 ug of protein) was incubated for 20
minutes at room temperature with 20 fmol biotinylated
DNA. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were subjected
to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Olig2 (DanaFarber Ab#308), PhosphoSerine 10,13,14-Olig2 (Abcam),
Lamin A/C (ActiveMotif), E47 (E2A) (Cell Signaling
Technology), Tubulin (Sigma).

Luciferase reporter assay for p21expression
The p21 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid was
constructed using a 2.4 kB fragment from the upstream
region containing OLIG2 binding sites in the human p21
promoter, and was a gift from Charles Stiles of the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute. The construct was co-transfected
with control vector pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-Green-Puro or
one encoding the human OLIG2 ORF using Purefection
(System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) into 293FT
cells. In some cell preparations 10 μM OLIG2 inhibitor
compound was added. Cells were harvested and assayed
for luciferase activity 24 h after transfection using a
luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and an
Infinite® M1000 PRO plate reader (Tecan, Morrisville,
NC) for luminescence quantification.

In vivo studies ethics statement
All animals were handled in accordance with
guidelines set forth by the National Institute of Health [45,
46] and the Principles for the Use and Care of Vertebrate
Animals [47]. Further, all the animal work described
herein was reviewed and approved by the University of
California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC).

Fluorescence-based thermal shift assay (TSA)

In vivo GBM flank xenograft tumor model

TSA was used to test affinity of the inhibitor
SKOG102 to recombinant OLIG2 protein. The assay
was conducted in the 96-well-based CFX-96 real-time
fluorescence plate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
The fluorescent dye Sypro Orange (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) was used to monitor the protein folding-unfolding
transition. Protein-ligand interaction was gauged by shift
in the unfolding transition temperature (ΔTm) acquired
with protein alone or with protein in the presence of
the inhibitor. Each reaction sample consisted of 9.8 µM
OLIG2 protein mixed with 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 µM inhibitor
in 1% DMSO, and incorporated 3X Sypro Orange dye
in 20 µl reaction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol). The sample plate
was heated from 25°C to 95°C with a thermal ramping
rate of 1°C/min. The fluorescence signals were acquired
with excitation and emission wavelengths centered at 490
and 560 nm, respectively. Affinity (KD) was calculated
based on the degree of fluorescent shift in protein melting
temperature (Tm) with and without the inhibitor [44].

2 x 106 GBM4 cells were implanted subcutaneously
in flanks of NSG mice. When tumors were measurable
at 50-110mm3, treatment was initiated. SKOG102 was
dissolved in solutol:PEG400:water (20%:40%:40%),
injected intraperitoneally. Dosing schedule was as follows:
The first 2 week period (from day 33 to 46) 10 mg/kg, the
third week (from day 47 to 54) 15 mg/kg, fourth week
(from 55 to 66) first 3 days 20 mg/kg, 2 days break, then
alternate days from day 60 to 66. Control mice were
treated with vehicle control on same schedule (n = 5).
Tumors were measured using calipers and their volume
was calculated using the standard formula, V = (length ×
width2)/2, p = 0.02.

Brain entry of SKOG102 inhibitor
SKOG102 at 5 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally
in 6 healthy, intact balb/c mice. Then at 1 and 4 hours
after injection the mice were deeply anesthetized and
blood samples were removed via cardiac puncture, and the
brains were dissected free. Brain sections were analyzed
by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to visualize
brain entry of SKOG102. LC-Mass spec was used to
