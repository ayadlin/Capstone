Abstract
Breast cancer metastasizes to bone, visceral organs, and/or brain depending on
the subtype, which may involve activation of a host organ-specific signaling network
in metastatic cells. To test this possibility, we determined gene expression patterns
in MDA-MB-231 cells and its mammary fat pad tumor (TMD-231), lung-metastasis
(LMD-231), bone-metastasis (BMD-231), adrenal-metastasis (ADMD-231) and brainmetastasis (231-BR) variants. When gene expression between metastases was
compared, 231-BR cells showed the highest gene expression difference followed
by ADMD-231, LMD-231, and BMD-231 cells. Neuronal transmembrane proteins
SLITRK2, TMEM47, and LYPD1 were specifically overexpressed in 231-BR cells.
Pathway-analyses revealed activation of signaling networks that would enable
cancer cells to adapt to organs of metastasis such as drug detoxification/oxidative
stress response/semaphorin neuronal pathway in 231-BR, Notch/orphan nuclear
receptor signals involved in steroidogenesis in ADMD-231, acute phase response in
LMD-231, and cytokine/hematopoietic stem cell signaling in BMD-231 cells. Only
NF-κB signaling pathway activation was common to all except BMD-231 cells. We
confirmed NF-κB activation in 231-BR and in a brain metastatic variant of 4T1 cells
(4T1-BR). Dimethylaminoparthenolide inhibited NF-κB activity, LYPD1 expression,
and proliferation of 231-BR and 4T1-BR cells. Thus, transcriptome change enabling
adaptation to host organs is likely one of the mechanisms associated with organspecific metastasis and could potentially be targeted therapeutically.

Introduction

median survival of only 3-6 months [5, 6]. Patients with
HER2+ or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a
greater propensity to develop brain metastasis [7-13].
Three processes may control brain metastasis.
The first may involve a minority of primary tumor cells
with unique mutations that impart proclivity for brain
metastasis. Recent massively parallel sequencing of
primary tumor and a brain metastasis from the same

Breast cancer brain metastasis is a growing public
health concern as advances in systemic therapy have
helped to contain metastatic growth in most organs
except the brain [1]. Brain metastasis occurs in 10-15%
of patients with metastatic breast cancer [2-4], and is
associated with an extremely poor prognosis with a

patient suggested this possibility [14]. The second is that
mutations and/or epigenetic changes in cancer cells bestow
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability and consequently
brain metastasis. The third is that every cancer cell has
the ability to reach the brain but only a few cells that can
acquire neuronal cell function through either additional
mutations in cancer cells or brain microenvironmentinduced epigenetic changes in cancer cells that are
essential for metastatic growth proliferate in the brain. For
example, circulating tumor cells that metastasize to the
brain overexpress proteins such as heparanase (HPSE) that
allow cancer cells to interact with brain vasculature [15].
Brain metastatic cancer cells express SERPINE1, which
helps in vascular co-adaptation in the brain [16]. The
Biology of Brain Metastasis Workshop organized by the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) has set several research
priorities with respect to biology of brain metastasis
[17]. These include investigations into the pathogenic
mechanisms of metastasis to brain, identification of
commonalities and uniqueness of brain metastasis versus
other sites of metastasis, differentiation of indolent and
aggressive lesions by understanding heterogeneity among
different brain metastatic lesions, investigation of the
relationship between “stem cell” features and brain
metastasis, and understanding the mechanisms responsible
for tumor cell homing to the brain.
Progress in addressing the above issues is limited
largely due to the lack of suitable model system. Most
of our current knowledge on brain metastasis is derived
from studies using brain-seeking variants developed
from HER2 -amplified BT474 cells and triple negative
breast cancer/mesenchymal stem cell-like cell line
MDA-MB-231 [18, 19]. Analyses of MDA-MB-231
derivatives enabled development of a brain metastasis
signature and identification of a set of genes that may
be involved in BBB extravasation. Genes identified in
these studies include the brain-specific sialyltransferase
ST6GALNAC5, COX2, ANGPTL4 and EGFR ligands
epiregulin and HBEGF [20]. NF-κB inducible genes
MMP-1 and FSCIN-1 are also associated with brain
metastasis [21]. In experimental models, brain-seeking
metastatic variants but not the variants that metastasize to
other organs have the ability to establish a unique pattern
of vascularization required for growth [22]. However,
gene expression changes in brain metastatic cells as an
adaptive response in the brain microenvironment are just
beginning to get attention.
To begin to address these complexities, we
compared gene expression patterns in cancer cells isolated
from a brain metastasis with parental cells in culture,
mammary fat pad tumor-derived cells, and cancer cells that
have metastasized to lungs, bone, and the adrenal gland.
We identified a set of genes that are upregulated only in
brain metastatic cells compared with all other cell types.
Several of these genes have neuronal function suggesting
that these genes are “reactivated” in the metastatic cell to

enable them to adapt to growth conditions in the brain and
utilize neuronal signaling networks for their advantage.
Comparison among cells isolated from different metastatic
sites revealed significantly higher transcriptome changes
in brain metastatic cancer cells and unique pathway
alterations involved in drug detoxification. In general,
metastasis, irrespective of organs of metastasis, was
associated with gain of gene expression suggesting that
hyper-activation of general transcriptional machinery is a
contributing factor of metastasis.

Results
Brain metastatic variants of MDA-MB-231
(231-BR) cells expressed a unique set of genes
compared with parental cells, mammary fat pad
tumor, or variants from other organs of metastasis
We recently reported an organ-specific metastasis
model of MDA-MB-231 cells that included establishing
cell lines from metastases in the lung, the bone, and the
adrenal gland [23]. The same cell line model has been
used to develop brain metastasis variants [24]. Using these
cell lines, we had demonstrated upregulation of 20 and
downregulation of seven microRNAs in metastatic cancer
cells compared with mammary fat pad tumor cells [23].
We subjected parental MDA-MB-231 cells from two labs
(one from us used for developing tumor and metastatic
variants except brain metastasis and the other used for
developing brain metastatic cells- these cells are labeled
MD-231P), mammary fat pad tumor derived cell line
(TMD-231), lung metastasis (LMD-231), bone metastasis
(BMD-231), adrenal metastasis (ADMD-231), and brain
metastasis (231-BR) to microarray mRNA expression
analysis. For the different sets of cell lines, we used PAM
[25] to identify signature genes for a specific metastasis
site compared with all other sites. PAM classifier is based
on the nearest shrunken centroid algorithm and identifies
signature genes based on the variability of genes in a
group. Using this method, we compared each metastatic
site’s gene expression profile to all other metastatic
expression profiles, tumor-derived cells, and parental
cells to compile a set of genes constituting a signature for
that metastatic site only. This stringent analysis generated
signatures that were unique to brain and adrenal metastasis
(Table S1). However, lung and bone metastasis signatures
were not as statistically robust as brain and adrenal
signatures and demonstrated a higher error rate (Table S1).
231-BR cells showed upregulation of 396 genes and
downregulation of 77 genes compared with all other cell
types (p < 0.01) (Table S2). In general, metastatic cells
showed a higher number of upregulated genes compared
with MDA-MB-231 or TMD-231 cells suggesting that
acquiring new gene expression rather than loss of gene

expression is associated with metastasis (Table S2, see
rows 1 and 2). The top 25-upregulated genes in 231-BR
cells are shown in Table 1. Several genes in this table
(indicated in bold) are linked to neuronal activity. For
example, translation elongation factor eEF1A2 variant
is expressed in a restricted pattern compared with
ubiquitously expressed eEF1A1, and the expression is
dominant in adult brain [26]. TMEM47 and SLITRK2 are
linked to neuronal development and/or brain tumors [27,
28]. TMEM47 is also called brain cell membrane protein
1 and is related to claudins [29]. Thus, upregulation of
genes linked to neuronal function in 231-BR cells support
the hypothesis that cancer cells acquire their expression
to adapt to the brain microenvironment. We confirmed
specific upregulation of LYPD1, TMEM47, and SLITRK2
in 231-BR cells compared with other cell types, as these
genes are not part of any previously described brain
metastatic signatures (Figure 1A). ESM1, which is
upregulated in all metastatic cell types compared with
parental or TMD-231 cells in the microarray assay, also
showed higher expression levels in LMD, BMD, ADMD231 cells and 231-BR cells compared with parental or
TMD-231 cells by qRT-PCR (Figure 1A). Results of
technical replicates are shown because of wide variation
in fold induction between experiments. For example, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

level of TMEM47 was higher in 231-BR by 193-, 92-,
153-, 891- and 631-fold compared with MD-231P cells
in five experiments. Similarly, LYPD1 levels were higher
by 19-, 49-, 6-, 49- and 44-fold in 231-BR cells compared
with MD-231P cells in five experiments (see also Figure 5
below for statistical analysis).
LYPD1,
TMEM47,
and
SLITRK2
are
transmembrane proteins likely involved in liganddependent signal transduction. SLITRK2 family genes,
including SLITRK2, are expressed predominantly in
brain [28]. These genes likely play critical roles in
cancer progression because cBioPortal analysis revealed
amplification and /or mutations of TMEM47, LYPD1
and SLITRK2 in a variety of cancers including breast
cancer [30]. Four percent of patient-derived breast
cancer xenografts in the cBioPortal show amplification
of LYPD1 and mutation in SLITRK2. However, there
are limited reports on the function of these proteins. To
gain insight into their function, we analyzed the STRING
database to identify potential interacting partners [31].
While no proteins interacting with TMEM47 were found,
LYPD1 and SLITRK2 appear to be involved in various
signaling including cell adhesion and neurotransmitter
signaling (Figure 1B). For example, GPR39, a G-proteincoupled receptor expressed mostly in brain, is at the top
12685

Oncotarget

of the list of LYPD1 interacting partners [32]. Neuronal
pentraxin-1 is the major interacting partner of SLITRK2,
which mediates synaptic remodeling [33]. Future studies
will determine the critical role played by these proteins
in adaptation of brain metastatic cells to the brain
microenvironment.
We created another brain metastatic variant from
BMD-231 cells. A nude mice injected with BMD-231
cells via intra-cardiac route developed brain metastasis
and metastatic cells were established in culture. These
cells, called 231-BR-2, overexpressed TMEM47 but not
other genes tested compared with BMD-231 cells (Figure
1C). We also observed elevated TMEM47 expression in
brain metastatic variant of MCF-7 cells overexpressing
HER2 (MCF-7HER2-BR) compared with parental MCF7 cells overexpressing HER2 oncogene (Figure 1D) [34].
Thus, TMEM47 is a new brain metastasis-associated gene.
Please note that CT values of SLITRK2 expression in 231BR-2 and MCF-7HER2-BR cells were above 30 and thus
are not reliable.
Analysis of a public database [35], which
contains gene expression data in on primary tumors but
not metastases, for the prognostic value of combined
expression of the top 17 genes overexpressed (> 2 fold,
p<0.0001, TMEM47, LYPD1, CD96, TFAP2C, EEF1A2,
DDX, MYH10, HOXB5, NINJ2, SERPINF1, CPE,
MAGEC2, CTLA3, C17orf70, ZNF704, NCKAP1L and
TIE1) in 231-BR cells for which data were available
showed elevated expression correlating with poor
recurrence-free survival of patients with basal or luminal
B breast cancer (Figure 2A and 2B). With respect to brain
metastasis-free survival, overexpression of TMEM47
was associated with poor brain metastasis-free survival
[20] (Figure 2C). TMEM47 displayed prognostic value
in estrogen receptor and progesterone negative but not
in estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive
breast cancer (data not shown). LYPD1 and SLITRK2 did
not show any significance.
We next determined whether the expression of
LYPD1, TMEM47 and/or SLITRK2 is enriched in a
specific intrinsic subtype of breast cancer. Three public
datasets were analyzed (GSE2607, GSE10886, and
GSE19783) [36-38]. LYPD1 but not SLITRK2 showed
a trend of elevated expression in basal subtype but
differences reached statistical significance only in the
GSE19783 dataset (Figure S1 and Figure S2). In this
dataset, TMEM47 also showed elevated expression in
Basal and HER2+ breast cancers compared with luminal
A and B breast cancers. Thus, overexpression of these
genes may not be unique to a subtype of breast cancer.
Alternatively, the brain microenvironment influences the
expression of these genes in metastatic cells irrespective
of the subtype.
Since no adrenal metastasis signature has been
defined so far, we examined 10 genes overexpressed in
ADMD-231 (>1.5 fold, p < 0.01) compared with other
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastases for prognostic relevance. Genes were selected
based on the availability of data in the public database
and included CYB5R2, TAGLN, HAND1, RAB3IL1,
TRMT12, TSPAN8, MMP3, STXBP6, AP1S2, and
HSPB8 [35]. Overexpression of these genes was
associated with poor recurrence-free survival and distant
metastasis-free in basal breast cancer (Figure 2D and
2E). Please note that these genes did not show prognostic
relevance in other intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer.

Genes differentially expressed in organ-specific
metastatic cells were linked to unique and shared
signaling networks
To determine the signaling pathways active in cells
isolated from different sites of metastasis, we subjected
differentially expressed genes to Ingenuity pathway
analysis. Glutathione-mediated detoxification, NRF2mediated oxidative stress response, and Semaphorin
signaling in neurons are a few of the signaling pathways
in 231-BR cells (Figure 3A). The top two networks in 231BR cells included SRC-ERK-growth hormone and NFκB (Figure 3B and 3C). SRC pathway activation has also
been noted previously in the BT474 HER2-positive cell
brain metastasis model [18]. Notch, LXR/RXR and FXR/
RXR pathways are the three major pathways activated in
ADMD-231 cells (Figure 4A). Networks in these cells
included Notch-ERK-AKT and NF-κB (Figure 4B and
4C).
LMD-231 cells showed activation of acute phase
response signaling, primary immunodeficiency signaling,
and glutamate receptor signaling (Figure S3A). Networks
included TNF-CEBPA-p53 and NF-κB (Figure S3B
and S3C). Involvement of CEBPA in the network is
interesting because of its critical role in lung maturation
[39]. BMD-231 cells displayed activation of cytokine
signaling, hematopoiesis from pluripotent stem cells and
JAK1/JAK3 cytokine signaling (Figure S4A). Signaling
networks in these cells included ERK-growth hormone
and TNF-p53 (Figure S4B and S4C). Activation of
neuronal, orphan nuclear receptor, acute phase response,
and cytokine signaling in brain, adrenal, lung, and bone
metastatic cells, respectively, further suggests organspecific adaptive response in metastatic cells.

231-BR cells displayed elevated NF-κB DNA
binding activity, which was sensitive to DMAPT
To extend the above observation from Ingenuity
pathway analysis, we examined NF-κB DNA binding
activity in MD-231P and 231-BR cells by electrophoretic
mobility shift assays (EMSAs). As we reported previously
[40], MD-231P cells displayed constitutive NF-κB DNA
binding activity, which was further elevated in 23112686

BR cells (Figure 5A). NF-κB:DNA complex contained
p65 and p50 subunits as per super-shift assay. We next
examined the effects of netropsin, which inhibits NF-κB
when DNA binding is dependent on HMGA2 [41], and
DMAPT, a direct NF-κB inhibitor. DMAPT is a watersoluble parthenolide derivative and has been characterized
for anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo [42-45]. While
netropsin had minimum effect, DMAPT significantly
reduced NF-κB DNA binding activity (Figure 5A). 231BR cells expressed ~65-fold higher levels of CXCL1, an
NF-κB inducible chemokine involved in metastasis [46],
compared with MD-231P cells, which was reduced by
DMAPT (Figure 5B). DMAPT reduced the expression
levels of LYPD1 (from 50 –fold to 10 fold) but not
TMEM47 suggesting that NF-κB controls the expression
of select genes of the brain metastasis signature (Figure
5B). In cell proliferation assays, while both MD-231P and
231-BR cells were sensitive to DMAPT, the concentration
of drug required to inhibit 231-BR cells was lower than
that for MD-231P cells (p = 0.0001) suggesting that 231BR cells are dependent on NF-κB for survival (Figure
5C).

focused on SERPIN1 and SERPINB2 and demonstrated
their role in establishing vascular adaptation in brain
[16]. Although SERPIN1 was not one of the upregulated
genes in 231-BR cells (1.22-fold increase but p=0.18),
significant upregulation of SERPINB2 and SERPINIF1,
a serpine family member without protease inhibitory
activity but with neurotropic activity [48], was observed in
213-BR cells compared with other metastatic cells (Table
S2). Among the other six genes (CTCF, DUSP1, GALC,
HIST1HIC, LEF1, and PCDH7), we found upregulation of
DUSP1 and GALC in all metastatic cells compared with
parental cells, irrespective of sites of metastasis. Among
the recently described DNA repair genes upregulated
in brain metastatic cells [49], we noted upregulation of
RAD51 (1.1-fold, p = 0.03) and RAD51C (1.4 fold, p =
0.016) but not BARD1 in 231-BR cells compared with
other metastatic cells (Table S2). However, 231-BR cells
did not show specific changes in the expression levels
of the recently described BRCA1 deficient-like gene
signature enriched in the brain metastasis of HER2+
breast cancer patients [50, 51]. Nonetheless, four among
13 genes of this signature (NDRG1, CCND1, BOP1, and
Myc) were upregulated in metastatic cells irrespective of
sites of metastasis compared with parental or TMD-231
cells (Table S2). Similarly, we did not find any overlap
between the brain metastasis signatures described in our
study and the signature described by Salhia et al. [52].
However, the CRYAB gene, which was downregulated in
the brain metastasis in the study described by Salhia et
al was also downregulated in all metastatic cells in our
analysis. Differences in the types of comparison adapted
in different studies may partly be responsible for minimum
overlap in genes between signatures. For example, our
evaluation involved comparison between parental and
metastasis as well as between organ-specific metastatic
cells whereas other studies compared brain metastasis with
only primary tumor.
Glutathione-mediated
detoxification,
NRF2mediated oxidative response, and Semaphorin signaling
pathways activated in brain metastatic cells suggest
a unique biology of these metastatic cancer cells and
potentially explain their relative resistance to standard
chemotherapy and possibly challenges the widely held
belief that poor BBB permeability of chemotherapeutic
drugs is the main reason for treatment failure. Inherent
ability to detoxify these drugs may be one of the main
reasons for treatment failure. In this respect, a recent
study has shown that physical interaction between cancer
cells and astrocytes leads to upregulation of glutathione
transferase 5A, which contributes to drug resistance [53].
DMAPT, the NF-κB inhibitor tested in this study, has
previously been shown to deplete glutathione and cause
the death of leukemic cells [54]. Thus, sensitivity of 231BR cells to DMAPT could be related to their dependency
on glutathione and the NF-κB signaling network and the
ability of DMAPT to inhibit both pathways. We also noted

4T1-BR cells showed elevated NF-κB compared
with 4T1 cells and were sensitive to DMAPT
To determine whether elevated NF-κB activity
is observed in additional brain metastasis models, we
compared NF-κB in parental 4T1 and a brain-seeking
variant of this cell line [45]. 4T1 cells are derived from a
spontaneous mammary tumor in BALB/c mice and form
highly metastatic tumors upon mammary fat pad injection
in syngeneic mice [47]. NF-κB DNA binding activity was
elevated in 4T1-BR cells compared with parental 4T1 cells
and DMAPT reduced this binding activity (Figure 6A).
Note that AP-1 DNA binding activity was lower in 4T1BR cells compared with 4T1 cells suggesting transcription
factor switch with specific upregulation of NF-κB in brain
metastatic cells. Unlike 231-BR cells, 4T1-BR cells and
parental 4T1 cells were similarly sensitive to DMAPT
(Figure 6B). Thus, brain metastatic cells in both model
systems show elevated NF-κB activity and can potentially
be targeted by NF-κB inhibitors.

Discussion
There have been several attempts to identify genes
associated with brain metastasis and to functionally
validate these genes for imparting blood brain barrier
extravasation, vascular co-adaptation, interaction with
brain microenvironment, and cell survival function. Using
brain metastatic cell lines derived from four different
models, Valiente et al. showed upregulation of seven
genes in three out of four models [16]. The authors then

activation of a signaling network involving SRC kinases
in 231-BR cells (Figure 3B), which has recently been
suggested to be a therapeutic target for brain metastasis
[18].
Although there have been large efforts in defining
gene expression signatures for bone and lung metastases
[55-57], an adrenal gland metastasis signature is yet to be
described. Minn et al. described MDA-MB-231 variants
that metastasize to both lungs and adrenal or bone and
adrenal but did not define an adrenal-specific gene
expression signature [58]. This study, to our knowledge,
describes the first adrenal metastatic signature for
breast cancer. Ten genes, which are expressed 1.5-fold
(p<0.01) higher in ADMD-231 compared with other
metastatic cells, displayed prognostic significance in
basal breast cancer but not in other subtypes (Figure 2).
There is limited literature on the consequences of adrenal
metastasis, although a rare case of adrenal failure due to
adrenal metastasis in breast cancer has been reported [59].
Transcriptome changes associated with adrenal metastasis
were significantly higher compared with bone or lung
metastasis (p = 0.0001, Chi-square with Yates correction)
suggesting the need for substantial genomic changes
to achieve this metastasis. Notch and orphan nuclear
receptor signaling were dominant in adrenal metastatic
cells. The Notch pathway plays a major role in adrenal
gland development, whereas LXR signaling controls
steroidogenic pathways in the adrenal gland [60]. Thus,
it is likely that cancer cells that have metastasized to the
adrenal gland undergo genomic changes that help them
to adapt to the adrenal gland or primary tumor cells with

these pathways activation metastasize preferentially to the
adrenal gland.
The majority of studies on breast cancer metastasis
utilized MDA-MB-231 cells. This cell line represents the
claudin-low/mesenchymal subtype, which overexpresses
stem cell-enriched genes [61] and has a natural tendency to
metastasize to brain and lungs. Brain and lung metastatic
signatures developed using this cell line have shown
clinical utility [62]. Several of the genes that were part of
the original bone metastatic signature developed using this
cell line, including CXCR4, CTGF, and MMP1, were part
of the general metastatic signature irrespective of organspecificity (Table S1) [55]. Because prior knowledge
exists on a lung metastatic signature, we did not perform
an extensive analysis. However, identification of acute
phase response and glutamate signaling networks in lung
metastatic cells suggests an adaptive response of these
cells to lung.
In summation, our results indicate that organspecific metastatic cells acquire the ability to adapt
to sites of metastasis, which may involve genomic or
epigenomic changes. We observed general upregulation
of transcription in metastatic cells compared with parental
cells suggesting that genomic aberrations leading to
enhanced RNA polymerase II activity are sufficient for
metastasis. Alternatively, genomic/epigenomic changes
in a few primary tumor cells may activate organ-specific
adaptive gene networks prior to their exit from the primary
site. In this respect, patients with primary tumors that
overexpressed brain or adrenal metastasis signature genes
had poor outcome (Figure 2). While inhibitors of NF-κB

Figure 6: 4T1-BR cells displayed elevated NF-κB activity compared with 4T1 cells. A) DMAPT inhibited NF-κB activity

in 4T1-BR cells. Note lower AP-1 DNA binding activity in 4T1-BR cells compared with 4T1 cells. B) DMAPT inhibited 4T1-BR cell

analysis. ANOVA analysis was performed to identify
genes differentially expressed between different cell lines.
Genes differentially expressed at p value of <0.01 were
considered further for pathway analysis using Ingenuity
pathway analysis software (© Ingenuity systems, CA,
USA). Prognostic relevance of overexpressed genes
was determined using a public database as well as a new
database created by us [35, 64]. Microarray dataset is
available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE66495).

signaling can be potential chemosensitizers of the majority
of metastases as we have demonstrated previously with
lung metastasis [44], organ-specific signaling networks
identified in this study can be used to develop drugs
targeting specific sites of metastasis to limit toxicity. In
addition, our study identified TMEM47, a transmembrane
protein with little known biology, as a brain metastasis
associated gene. TMEM47 could potentially be developed
as a biomarker and targeted therapeutically based on its
cellular localization at the membrane.

Generation of metastasis signatures

Materials and Methods

Predictive analysis of Microarray (PAM) [25] was
used to identify signature genes capable of discriminating
phenotypes with minimal classification error. PAM
analysis was performed on a 1 X Rest basis comparing one
phenotype with all other phenotypes to identify a group
of genes that could differentiate that phenotype from the
rest of phenotypes arriving at gene signatures specific for
each phenotypic group. Thresholds for PAM analysis were
adjusted to identify the smallest possible gene signature
with minimal misclassification error rate.

Cell lines
MDA-MB-231 and its mammary fat pad tumor and
metastatic derivatives have been described [23]. 231-BR
and its parental counter part MD-231P, 4T1 and 4T1-BR
cells have been described [49, 63]. We also generated
a new brain metastatic variant (231-BR-2) from a nude
mouse that developed brain metastasis after intra-cardiac
injection of bone metastatic variant (BMD-231). Despite
the potential for genomic drift during growth within
animals and/or during culturing after isolation from sites
of metastasis, cell line identification using short tandem
repeat profiling (DNA Diagnosis Center, Fairfield,
Ohio, USA and Genetica DNA Laboratories, Cincinnati,
Ohio, USA) confirmed that all variants are genomically
similar to parental MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231
and its derivatives were maintained in MEM plus 10%
FBS, whereas 4T1 and 4T1-BR cells were maintained in
DMEM plus 10% FBS.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)
and cell proliferation studies
EMSA with whole cell lysates was performed
as described previously [65]. Probes for the assay were
purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA), whereas
antibodies for supershift were from EMD Millipore
(Billerica, MA, USA). For cell proliferation studies, 1000
cells/well were plated on a 96-well plate and cells were
treated with DMAPT (eight wells per drug and highest
and lowest numbers were discarded during analysis). Cell
proliferation was measured 48 hours after drug treatment
using Bromodeoxyuridine-ELISA (Calbiochem/ EMD
Millipore). Results are from two or more independent
experiments.

RNA preparation, microarray and quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
RNA was prepared using RNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and cDNA from four µgs of RNA
was synthesized using the cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was performed using
SyberGreen on a TaqMan 7900HT instrument (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sequences of primers
used for qRT-PCR are listed in the supplementary Table
S3. Illumina HumanHT-12 V4 expression beadchip was
used for microarray analysis of biological triplicates.
Genes that showed insignificant signals in a majority of
samples were removed and only those probes that showed
statistically significant signal in at least half of samples
of at least one group were retained. The probe level
data were then collapsed to gene level data by retaining
only the probes, which showed a maximal coefficient
of variation across all samples. The data were imported
into Partek genomics suite for differential expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Graphpad Prism (Graphpad.com) was used for
statistical analysis of qRT-PCR and cell proliferation
assay. Analysis of variance was used to determine the
P-values between mean measurements. A P-value of <0.05
was deemed significant.
