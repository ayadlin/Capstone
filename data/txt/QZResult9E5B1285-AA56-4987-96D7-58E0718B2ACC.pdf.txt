Abstract
Aberrant expression and polymorphism of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) has been linked to
tumor progression and anticancer drug resistance. We describe here a novel mechanism of tumor progression
by matrix degradation involving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in response to membrane-type 1 matrix
metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) induction at the edge of tumors expressing the FGFR4-R388 risk variant. Both FGFR4 and MT1-MMP were upregulated in tissue biopsies from several human cancer types including breast adenocarcinomas, where they were partially coexpressed at the tumor/stroma border and tumor
invasion front. The strongest overall coexpression was found in prostate carcinoma. Studies with cultured
prostate carcinoma cell lines showed that the FGFR4-R388 variant, which has previously been associated with
poor cancer prognosis, increased MT1-MMP–dependent collagen invasion. In this experimental model, knockdown of FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP by RNA interference blocked tumor cell invasion and growth in collagen.
This was coupled with impaired phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 and Src, upregulation of E-cadherin, and
suppression of cadherin-11 and N-cadherin. These in vitro results were substantiated by reduced MT1-MMP
content and in vivo growth of prostate carcinoma cells after the FGFR4-R388 gene silencing. In contrast,
knockdown of the alternative FGFR4-G388 allele enhanced MT1-MMP and invasive tumor cell growth in vivo
and within three-dimensional collagen. These results will help to explain the reported association of the
FGFR4-R388 variant with the progression and poor prognosis of certain types of tumors. Cancer Res; 70(20);

Introduction
Tumor progression is frequently associated with aberrant
activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway
(1, 2). Cancer-associated genetic alterations such as singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), translocations, missense
mutations, and gene amplifications or altered expression
have been reported for each of the four FGF receptors (FGFR;
refs. 1–4). FGFR4 upregulation occurs in advanced prostate,
breast, pancreatic, and gynecologic cancers as well as in

rhabdomyosarcomas (3–7), and in breast cancer, it has been
associated with resistance to chemotherapy (8). Furthermore, a SNP in codon 388 of the human FGFR4 gene has been
linked to poor prognosis of patients with several types of tumors such as adenocarcinomas of the breast, prostate, and
colon as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
and melanomas (9–14). In the FGFR4-R388 risk variant,
Gly388 in the transmembrane domain is changed to arginine,
resulting in enhanced stability and prolonged activation of
the receptor (15).
FGFRs are activated by the binding of two FGF molecules
in a complex with heparin sulfate proteoglycan to their
extracellular part. This triggers FGFR dimerization, leading
to autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (1, 2). Subsequent
phosphorylation of docking proteins, FGFR substrate 2α
and β (FRS2α/β), and downstream signaling through
Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), and Src
pathways then serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. In vivo, FGFR signaling has
been associated with tumor initiation and growth (1, 2).
Recently, the FGFR4 G385R mutation in the mouse genome
(analogous to the human G388R SNP) has been shown to

accelerate WAP-TGFα transgene-induced mammary carcinoma
development and progression (16). This was associated with
increased transformation and migration/invasiveness of
FGFR4-R388 mouse embryonic fibroblasts, whereas the cellular
and molecular mechanisms of the increased carcinoma
progression remained unclear.
On carcinoma progression, the neoplastic epithelium can
become invasive through the process of epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT; refs. 17, 18). This results
in loss of apical-basal polarization, dissociation of epithelial cell-cell junctions, and gain of mesenchymal morphology
plus an invasive protein expression pattern (17, 18). Alternatively, tumor cells can invade collectively without loosing
their cell-cell contacts (18, 19). In this process, leading cells
protrude pseudopods and provide microtracks by extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, which allows the following
carcinoma cells to migrate as a cohort (20). In human and
mouse carcinomas, signs of EMT are frequently observed
in the leading cells of collectively invasive tumor fronts
(18, 19). Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MTMMP) expressed in the tumor cells or stroma mediate
both EMT-induced single-cell invasion and collective tumor
invasion (17, 20–23). MT-MMPs can promote invasiveness
by cleaving ECM, cell surface receptors, and pericellular
proteins or by activating secreted MMPs (17, 24, 25). We
have recently identified an MT1-MMP/FGFR4 complex by
a kinome screen (26). In this complex, the FGFR4 G388R
polymorphism stabilizes both FGFR4 and MT1-MMP, thus
enhancing receptor tyrosine kinase and proteolytic activities. To understand the biological relevance of the FGFR4/
MT1-MMP interaction in tumor progression, we have here
examined the coexpression of FGFR4 and MT1-MMP in
human tumors. The functions of the FGFR4 allelic variants
in MT1-MMP–dependent tumor cell invasion and growth
were defined using stable gene silencing in three-dimensional
(3D) cell cultures and tumor xenografts.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and antibodies
DU145 (FGFR4; G/G) and PC3 (FGFR4; R/R) prostate adenocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
cultured according to the instructions. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MT1MMP (27), FGFR4, β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
collagen types I and IV (Millipore), von Willebrand factor
(vWF; Dako), pan-cadherin (Sigma), phosphorylated FRS2,
phosphorylated PLCγ, phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), and phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling); mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against cadherin-11
(Invitrogen), E-cadherin, N-cadherin (BD Biosciences), and
MT1-MMP (28); and goat polyclonal antibody against collagen
IV (Millipore).
cDNAs, small interfering RNAs, and short hairpin RNAs
The cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding human MT1-MMP (27, 29), FGFR4-G388, FGFR4-R388,
or the respective kinase activity–deficient FGFR4 cDNAs

(30, 31) using FuGENE HD (Roche). Short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) targeted against MT1-MMP (TRCN0000050853 and
TRCN0000050855) and FGFR4 (TRCN0000000628 and
TRCN0000010531; Open Biosystems) or nontargeting scrambled shRNA was used to produce lentiviruses and infect cells
as described (32). Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against human FGFR1 (SI02224677; SI03059252), FGFR4 (SI02665306;
SI00031360), MT1-MMP (SI03648841), and nonsilencing control siRNA (Qiagen) were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). Knockdown efficiency was monitored by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) after 48 hours.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting
were carried out as described (27, 29) or using anti-FGFR4
antibody–conjugated agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and anti-HA agarose affinity gels (Sigma).
Immunofluorescence
Fixed cells were immunostained with indicated antibodies
as described (27, 29). Images were obtained using Zeiss LSM
5 DUO confocal microscope or Axioplan upright epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss).
3D growth and invasion
Collagen invasion was assessed essentially as described
(24) and as further explained in Supplementary Data. For
3D cell culture, single-cell suspension (4 × 104 cells/mL)
was prepared in 2.2 mg/mL collagen I solution followed
by casting 50 μL gels onto 24-well plates and cultured
for 6 days in complete medium. Sphere-shaped cell colonies that grew in the gels were stained after paraformaldehyde fixation with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma)
and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for confocal imaging or epifluorescence using Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. For relative sphere size, spheres in 30 random
phase-contrast images of six separate gels were measured
(58–106 spheres/shRNA-transduced cell line, n = 3) using
ImageJ software. The number of invasive spheres with surrounding single cells, multicellular sprouts, or nodular extensions of at least three single cells in collagen was
counted. The results are expressed as relative ratio of invasive spheres to total random spheres.
Tumor growth in mice
Experiments were approved by the State Provincial Office
of Southern Finland. PC3 and DU145 cells were lentivirally
transduced with a Renilla luciferase–green fluorescent protein
fusion reporter protein. Stable cell pools expressing scrambled, MT1-MMP, and FGFR4-targeting shRNAs were selected
by puromycin (Sigma). Cell pools with >95% initial knockdown efficiencies (2 × 106 cells/mouse) were implanted into
the abdominal subcutis of ICR-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) male mice (5–7 weeks of age; Taconic)
and allowed to grow for 6 to 8 weeks. Tumor size was
measured with a caliper, and noninvasive bioluminescence
was visualized after i.p. injection of coelenterazine (35 μg
in 100 μL PBS; Synchem) using a Xenogen IVIS System.

FGFR4/MT1-MMP Interplay in Tumor Invasion

The experiments with five mice per group were repeated
twice with similar results.
Histologic analyses and immunohistochemistry
Tumor and normal frozen tissue arrays (FMC401 and
BRF401; US Biomax, Inc.) were stained with pretitrated dilutions of polyclonal anti-FGFR4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti–MT1-MMP mAbs produced by
immunization of the MT1-MMP−/− mice (28) as described in
Supplementary Data. Mouse tumors and lymph nodes were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded
in paraffin followed by H&E and Herovici collagen staining.
Vessels with intravasated tumor cells were counted from
H&E-stained sections. Frozen sections (20 μm) were subjected to immunofluorescence using indicated primary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 secondary antibodies.
qPCR and FGFR4 alleles
mRNA was extracted and quantified in the cell and tissue
extracts as well as in Tissue Scan Breast Cancer qPCR Array
III (OriGene Technologies) essentially as described (32) and
as explained in Supplementary Materials and Methods. The
fragments of FGFR4 cDNA containing the G388R site (1,329–
1 , 3 31 b p ) w e r e a m p l i f i e d b y P C R ( p r i m e r s : T A C CAGTCTGCCTGGCTC and AGTACGTGCAGAGGCCTT) and
digested with BstN1 (New England Biolabs). R388 allele was
identified by a specific 126-bp fragment, and G388 allele by
two fragments (97 and 29 bp). Unclear results were confirmed by sequencing.
GeneSapiens
GeneSapiens expression data are derived from the database version 3 predating the published version 4. The normalized expression data in version 3 were constructed
from 9,783 human tissue samples as described (33), with
the exception of using original CDF files from Affymetrix
and somewhat different collection of raw source data files.
Statistical analysis
All numerical values represent mean ± SE or SD. Statistical
significance was determined using two-tailed Student's t tests.

Results
FGFR4 and MT1-MMP coexpression in
breast carcinomas
To analyze if the FGFR4 allelic variants and MT1-MMP are
coexpressed in vivo, we used a qPCR array from 48 human
breast cancer biopsies. Of these, 27 (56%) had homozygous
or heterozygous FGFR4-R388 risk alleles (R/R, 8%; G/R, 48%)
and 21 had homozygous FGFR4-G388 (G/G, 44%; Fig. 1A). All
homozygous R388 samples were from the highest-grade (3)
tumors, consistent with the poor prognosis reported for patients with this allele (9–14). The FGFR4 R/R tumors had 2.6fold higher mean MT1-MMP mRNA expression over the G/G
tumors (P = 0.0007), whereas FGFR4 expression was relatively
low in the R/R tumors (Fig. 1A and B). No significant correlation was observed between FGFR4 and MT1-MMP mRNAs

www.aacrjournals.org

in individual breast tissue biopsies (Fig. 1A), suggesting that
the FGFR4 G388R SNP may contribute indirectly to MT1MMP transcription in the carcinoma cells and/or stroma.
To define the cell types that express FGFR4 and MT1MMP in the tumors, tissue section arrays containing 42 normal or malignant breast tissue samples were subjected to
immunohistochemistry. Faint FGFR4 staining was detected
in luminal epithelial cells in all four biopsies of normal
breast, whereas MT1-MMP was undetectable in the normal
epithelium and negligible in stroma (Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Fig. S1; modestly positive stroma in two of four biopsies).
FGFR4 was increased in carcinoma cells (20 of 38 cases;
Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Fig. S1), and MT1-MMP was
increased in the reactive stroma (carcinoma in situ, 3 of 8;
invasive ductal carcinoma, 17 of 28; invasive lobular carcinoma, 2 of 2; Fig. 1D), as previously reported (4, 21–23, 34).
MT1-MMP was also induced in the myoepithelium that
was abutting the stroma of in situ breast carcinomas (7 of
8; Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1) and in poorly differentiated
cells of invasive ductal carcinomas (13 of 28; Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S1) relative to normal tissue. These two cell
types also expressed FGFR4 and thus represented the unexpectedly restricted MT1-MMP and FGFR4 codistribution in
breast carcinomas (Fig. 1C and D).
MT1-MMP and FGFR4 are coexpressed in tumor edges
and prostate carcinoma
To assess FGFR4 and MT1-MMP coexpression in different
human tumor types, we first used frozen tissue arrays composed of single sections from 14 different malignant and
normal tissue types. MT1-MMP upregulation was observed
in the tumor cells (9 of 14; Supplementary Table S1) and/or
reactive stroma (9 of 14), whereas FGFR4 expression was
mainly found in the tumor cells (Supplementary Table S1).
In ovarian, stomach, pancreas, lung, and colon tumor sections
containing stromal MT1-MMP, further MT1-MMP expression
in the FGFR4-expressing carcinoma cells was observed
(Supplementary Table S1). This localized particularly to the
tumor cells adjacent to the stroma and into the tumor cell
foci as shown for a lung squamous cell carcinoma and colon
adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Further analysis using GeneSapiens database (33) revealed
that FGFR4 and MT1-MMP were frequently upregulated in
same tumor types including carcinomas of the breast, colon,
testis, and uterus when compared with normal tissues (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). However, the correlation plots of
FGFR4 and MT1-MMP expression in individual tissue biopsies from different human tumor types revealed weak or no
correlation (Fig. 2B). Two interesting exceptions were a positive correlation in prostate cancers, which did not display
markedly enhanced mean MT1-MMP or FGFR4 expression
(r = 0.633, n = 357, P < 1 × 10−8) and a negative correlation
in sarcomas (r = −0.433, n = 161, P = 1 × 10−8). FGFR4 was
exceptionally induced in rhabdomyosarcomas (Fig. 2B),
whereas only MT1-MMP was strongly expressed in osteosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, and fibrosarcomas. These expression
profiles raise the possibility of FGFR4/MT1-MMP interplay
particularly at the tumor edges and in the individual tumors

FGFR4-R388 enhances MT1-MMP–mediated prostate
carcinoma cell invasion
To determine the effects of FGFR4 and MT1-MMP in
cell invasion, we assessed MT1-MMP and FGFR4 expression
in relation to collagen invasion of cultured tumor cells.
Consistent with the coexpression in human prostate cancers in vivo, PC3 and DU145 prostate adenocarcinoma cells
expressed both MT1-MMP and homozygous FGFR4-R388 or
FGFR4-G388 variant as well as FGFR1 (Supplementary Fig.
S4A; ref. 4). Unexpectedly, most other tumor cell lines analyzed expressed either MT1-MMP or FGFR4 mRNA (Sup-

lines, which displayed signs of EMT and invaded collagen
rapidly as single cells (HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, MDA-MB-231
breast carcinoma, and SCC-25 squamous cell carcinoma).
In contrast, MDA-MB-453, ZR-75-1, and BT-474 breast carcinoma cells and WiDr colon carcinoma cells expressed
FGFR4 but had negligible MT1-MMP and invasiveness in
collagen (Supplementary Table S2). This suggests that the
restricted coexpression observed at the tumor edges and
poorly differentiated cells in vivo was dependent on the
local tumor tissue environment and/or the activated
myoepithelium. Importantly, PC3 cells coexpressing the
FGFR4-R388 risk allele and MT1-MMP invaded collagen gels
efficiently, whereas the DU145 cells homozygous for the

FGFR4/MT1-MMP Interplay in Tumor Invasion

FGFR4-G388 allele did not, unless they were transfected with
FGFR4-R388 cDNA (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S4B). Collagen
invasion was blocked by the depletion of MT1-MMP by
siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4B–D). FGFR1 knockdown
seemed to instead increase collagen invasion (Supplementary Fig. S4D–F). Notably, FGFR4 siRNAs inhibited 87% of
the PC3 cell invasion (Fig. 3), indicating that the FGFR4R388 risk variant and MT1-MMP cooperatively promote
prostate carcinoma cell invasion in 3D collagen.
FGFR4-R388 and FGFR4-G388 have opposite effects
on tumor cell invasion
Lentiviral shRNAs were used next for stable FGFR4 and
MT1-MMP gene silencing in PC3 and DU145 cells. To investigate tumor cell growth and invasion in 3D environment
(19, 35), single cells were implanted inside cross-linked collagen matrix. During a 6-day culture, control shRNA–transduced
PC3 and DU145 cells both formed sphere-shaped colonies
within collagen (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the rapid PC3 cell
(FGFR4; R/R) invasion from atop collagen (see Fig. 3), more
single cells and collective cell foci had invaded into collagen
around the PC3 cell spheres compared with DU145 cells

(FGFR4; G/G; Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S5A). MT1-MMP
knockdown decreased the growth and invasion of both PC3
and DU145 cell colonies, as expected (Fig. 4A and B; Supplementary Fig. S5A). Importantly, 95% reduction of mRNAs for
the FGFR4-R388 risk allele also inhibited the growth and invasion of PC3 cell spheres, simultaneously increasing the epithelial organization in the cells observed by cortical actin staining
(Fig. 4A and B). MT1-MMP protein, but not mRNA expression,
decreased in parallel (Fig. 4B and C). In contrast, FGFR4-G388
silencing increased MT1-MMP protein (but not mRNA) expression (Fig. 4B and C) as well as the collective invasion of
DU145 cells, as observed by multicellular extensions and irregular shape of the spheres in the fixed 3D collagen gels (Fig. 4A).
Unexpectedly, MT1-MMP knockdown resulted in increased
expression of mRNA for the MT1-MMP–suppressive FGFR4G388 in the DU145 cells (Fig. 4B).
Considering the observed changes in epithelial organization within the spheres (Fig. 4A), the expression of cell-cell
junctional and proinvasive cadherins was investigated. Notably, E-cadherin, important for stable cell-cell contacts and
epithelial quiescence, was increased, whereas N-cadherin
and particularly cadherin-11, linked to prostate cancer

metastasis (36), were suppressed by either FGFR4-R388 or
MT1-MMP knockdown (Fig. 4D). Coincidentally, the FGF2induced phosphorylation of FRS2 and Src was inhibited in
PC3 cells, whereas FGFR4-G388 silencing altered neither
FRS2 or Src phosphorylation nor cadherins in DU145 cells
(Fig. 4D). These shRNA-induced changes did not correlate
with ERK, Akt, or PLCγ activation (Fig. 4D; Supplementary
Fig. S5B). Furthermore, stable silencing of MT1-MMP or
either variant of FGFR4 had minor effects on cell growth
in the monolayer cultures (Supplementary Fig. S5C and D).
These results indicate that both FGFR4-R388 and MT1MMP are required for EMT and collagen invasion of PC3
cells. They also indicate that the FGFR4-G388 allele has an
opposite effect on MT1-MMP and tumor cell invasion in
3D collagen.
FGFR4 controls MT1-MMP–dependent ECM
degradation and tumor progression involving
EMT in vivo
To investigate the effects of FGFR4 and MT1-MMP in tumorigenesis in vivo, tumor growth, invasion, and collagen
content were analyzed after s.c. injection of PC3 and
DU145 cells into SCID mice. The growth rates of PC3 tumors
were dramatically decreased after stable knockdown of either
MT1-MMP or the FGFR4-R388 risk variant (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S6A; >70% reduction of respective mRNAs in
the tumors). Vascular and lymph node invasion decreased
accordingly (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S6B; Supplementary
Table S3). Notably, only control PC3 cells were able to fully
colonize the lymph nodes, although tumor cells were occasionally detected in a few lymph vessels after MT1-MMP or
FGFR4-R388 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Furthermore, human tumor cell mRNA was detected by qPCR only
in the lungs of mice carrying control PC3 tumors (Supple-

7856

Cancer Res; 70(20) October 15, 2010

mentary Table S3). Importantly, the severely impaired
growth, mitotic index, as well as vascular and lymph node
invasion of MT1-MMP and FGFR4-R388 knockdown tumors
correlated inversely with the increased tumor collagen content (Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8A and B).
Both the fibrous capsule around the tumor and intratumoral
collagen increased markedly, although collagen (collagen IA,
IIA, and IV) mRNA levels were not altered in the same tumors (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S8B and C). MT1-MMP
knockdown increased the collagen content of both PC3
and DU145 tumors simultaneously with their decreased
growth (Fig. 5A and C; Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8B
and D). In contrast, FGFR4-G388 silencing decreased collagen accumulation and increased the growth and vascular
invasion of the less aggressive DU145 tumors (Fig. 5A–C;
Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8A, B, and D).
To assess if the opposite effects of FGFR4-R388 and FGFR4G388 silencing on collagen accumulation and tumor spread
involved differential MT1-MMP regulation in vivo, frozen PC3
and DU145 tumor sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry. As expected on the basis of mRNA expression and
the MT1-MMP protein regulation by the FGFR4 variants in
the corresponding cultured cells (see Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4A), more MT1-MMP was detected in PC3 tumors
than in DU145 tumors (Fig. 6A). The staining was specific
because only rare MT1-MMP–expressing cells were observed after MT1-MMP knockdown (Fig. 6A). Importantly,
the knockdown of the FGFR4-R388 risk variant also decreased MT1-MMP dramatically in the PC3 tumors, whereas
FGFR4-G388 knockdown increased MT1-MMP that became
abundant particularly at the edges of the DU145 tumors
(Fig. 6A). Strikingly, the impaired growth and invasion of
the MT1-MMP and FGFR4-R388 knockdown PC3 tumors
were coupled with increased epithelial polarization and

and reduced signs of EMT (Fig. 6B). In contrast, FGFR4-G388
silencing did not result in collagen IV accumulation in the
DU145 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8D). These results indicate that when coexpressed with MT1-MMP, the FGFR4R388 risk variant stimulates EMT and MT1-MMP–dependent
ECM degradation, thus promoting tumor progression.

Discussion

Figure 4. Cooperative FGFR4-R388 and MT1-MMP–dependent EMT or
knockdown of the MT1-MMP–suppressive FGFR4-G388 promotes
invasive tumor cell growth. A, PC3 (FGFR4; R/R) and DU145 (FGFR4;
G/G) cells were embedded in 3D collagen as single-cell suspension after
stable MT1-MMP or FGFR4 knockdown by lentiviral shRNAs. Confocal
laser scanning micrographs show the cells stained for filamentous actin
(red) after the 6-d assay. DAPI counterstaining (blue) visualizes nuclei.
The average size of cell spheres and number of the invasive spheres are
indicated below each micrograph (58–106 spheres/cell line, mean ± 1
SE, n = 3). B, MT1-MMP and FGFR4 mRNAs were detected by qPCR
in the stable knockdown cells. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE.
C, endogenous FGFR4 variants regulate MT1-MMP protein expression.
The cells were incubated with FGF2 (10 ng/mL) for 15 min and subjected
to immunoblotting. Mean values of relative MT1-MMP levels are
expressed below each lane (n = 3). D, the cells were subjected to
immunoblotting for cadherins and activated signaling intermediates as
indicated (n = 3). Ponceau red staining served as a loading control.

Collective cell invasion and EMT have emerged as important mechanisms for tissue invasion and metastasis of tumor
cells, which are the rate-limiting steps in cancer progression
(19, 37–39). MT1-MMP–mediated ECM degradation by tumor
cells or stromal cells is essential for both types of invasion
through basement membranes and stromal interstitial matrix
(19, 40, 41). We observed an unexpectedly selective coexpression of MT1-MMP and FGFR4 in the human tumor-stromal
borders, tumor invasion fronts, and some poorly differentiated
invasive breast carcinoma cells. This raised the possibility of a
yet undefined regulatory mechanism of tumor invasion involving the MT1-MMP/FGFR4 membrane complexes that are activated by the FGFR4 G388R SNP associated with poor cancer
prognosis (26). Indeed, we found that stable silencing of either
FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP by lentiviral shRNAs inhibited MT1MMP–mediated human PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell
invasion into 3D collagen. Simultaneously, FGF-induced activation of the FRS2-Src pathway and tumor progression were
blocked along with signs of reversed EMT, or mesenchymalto-epithelial transition.
We found that either FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP silencing
decreased MT1-MMP in cultured PC3 cells and the corresponding tumor xenografts, which supports our recent results
of MT1-MMP protein stabilization by the FGFR4-R388 risk
variant. Consistent with MT1-MMP being a major collagenase
in vivo (35, 42), the reduced MT1-MMP correlated with increased accumulation of collagenous matrix within and
around the tumors. These results are important because
collagen-containing stroma and cross-linked 3D collagen
serve as a physical barrier, which degradation by MT1-MMP
facilitates cell growth and invasion (35, 40, 41). Accordingly,
mitotic index as well as vascular and lymph node invasion
in vivo decreased after FGFR-R388 or MT1-MMP silencing.
MT1-MMP and collagen mRNAs were not affected, suggesting
that FGFR4-R388 regulates collagen degradation and thus invasive tumor growth by increasing MT1-MMP protein in the
tumor cells. This FGFR4-R388 function was distinct from
mitogenic signaling because FGFR4-R388 silencing did not
impair FGF signaling through ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways
or cell growth in adherent monolayer cultures. Furthermore,
the most potent mitogenic FGFR, FGFR1, was not required for
collagen invasion (1–3). Silencing either one of the FGFR4
alleles or FGFR1 has been reported to inhibit the proliferation
and migration of prostate carcinoma cells through a lamininrich matrix (4). However, unlike invasion across basement

FGFR4/MT1-MMP Interplay in Tumor Invasion

membranes or interstitial collagen, these assays do not require
matrix proteolysis (17, 24, 42). MT1-MMP regulation by
FGFR4-R388 thus provides a new mechanism of collagen degradation and cell invasion. This helps to explain the contribution of the G388R SNP to the progression of certain tumors and
poor prognosis of cancer patients (9–14, 16).
In contrast, the silencing of the alternative FGFR4-G388
alleles resulted in increased DU145 tumor growth and vascular
invasion, as well as MT1-MMP protein content particularly at
the tumor edges. This was coupled with partial loss of intratumoral collagen and fibrous capsule around the tumors. Because the MT1-MMP mRNA was not affected, also this
negative MT1-MMP regulation occurred at the protein level.
Interestingly, whereas the inverse regulation of MT1-MMP
by the FGFR4 variants was posttranscriptional, stable MT1MMP silencing instead increased FGFR4-G388 mRNA. Thus,
our results suggest that a transcriptional FGFR4-G388 suppression on MT1-MMP induction at the tumor edges could
provide the tumor cells that carry this FGFR4 allele with
a feedback mechanism to promote invasion. However,
the FGFR4 G388R SNP-dependent MT1-MMP/FGFR4 interplay discovered here in cells coexpressing both proteins may
not apply in tumors expressing MT1-MMP exclusively in
stromal cells and FGFR4 in tumor cells. Indeed, only stromal
MT1-MMP has been reported to be induced in MMTV-PymT
transgenic mouse mammary carcinoma (21, 22), thus explaining why the G385R mutation had no effect on the tumor progression in this breast carcinoma model (16).

Importantly, we also observed increased epithelial differentiation of PC3 cells after FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP silencing.
In vivo, this was observed as acinar morphology and increased
cell-cell junctional cadherins and basement membrane components. Many of these components, which support epithelial
cell differentiation and quiescence (42), are MT1-MMP substrates (25). Because there were no consistent changes in
laminin or type IV collagen mRNAs, we suppose that the
MT1-MMP/FGFR4-R388 interaction enhanced the degradation of both basement membranes and fibrillar collagen in
the rapidly growing and invasive PC3 tumors. MT1-MMP can
also induce shedding of cadherins and other receptors, which
could directly contribute to the EMT (43). However, increased
MT1-MMP, invasive growth, and vascular invasion of cell cohorts did not involve loss of E-cadherin or upregulation of the
proinvasive cadherins in the DU145 cells. In these cells, the
FRS2-Src pathway was not altered by FGFR4-G388 silencing,
and in the corresponding tumors, basement membrane collagen was mainly restricted to the blood vessels. Therefore, the
functional MT1-MMP/FGFR4-R388 interaction seems to contribute to EMT both by preventing basement membrane accumulation and by altering cadherins through FGF signaling.
Tumor cells have recently been found to develop resistance to
the therapy through increased invasion (38, 45). Better understanding of different invasion mechanisms is thus essential for
the development of novel interventions to inhibit tumor progression. Our results of increased MT1-MMP and invasive tumor
growth after FGFR4-G388 silencing will help to explain the

reported tumor-suppressive functions of this allele (3, 46, 47). As
such, FGFR4 targeting could even be harmful by increasing invasiveness in patients with homozygous G388 alleles. Most importantly, the present results identify the FGFR4-R388 risk
variant as a critical enhancer of MT1-MMP, ECM degradation,
and cadherin switch independently of mitogenic FGF signaling,
providing a mechanistic basis for the proinvasive FGFR-R388
function in tumor progression. FGFR4-R388 could serve as an
ideal target to inhibit tumor invasion because it is selectively
upregulated in aggressive tumors (2–4), yet unlike MT1-MMP
(42, 48), it can be deleted from mice without causing obvious
developmental or functional defects (3).
