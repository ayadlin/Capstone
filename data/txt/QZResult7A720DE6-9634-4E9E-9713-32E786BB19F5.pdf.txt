ABSTRACT
Background: Most studies utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor
disease interrogated only one or a few genes and failed to develop workable criteria
to inform clinical practice. We evaluated the feasibility of detecting resistance to antiHER2 therapy by serial gene-panel ctDNA sequencing.
Results: Primary therapeutic resistance was identified in 6 out of 14 patients
with events of progressive disease. For this subset comparison of pre- and posttreatment ctDNA assay results revealed that HER2 amplification concurred with
disease progression (4/6, 66.7%). Mutations in TP53 (3/6, 50.0%) and genes
implicated in the PI3K/mTOR pathway (3/6, 50.0%) were also dominant markers
of resistance. Together, resistance to HER2 blockade should be indicated during
treatment if any of the following situations applies: 1) recurrence or persistence of
HER2 amplification in the blood; 2) emergence or ≥20% increase in the fraction of
mutations in any of these resistance-related genes including TP53/PIK3CA/MTOR/
PTEN. Compared with CT scans, dynamic ctDNA profiling utilizing pre-defined criteria
was sensitive in identifying drug resistance (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 55.0%),
with a concordance rate up to 82.1%. Besides, the ctDNA criteria had a discriminating
role in the prognosis of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Methods: 52 plasma samples were prospectively collected from 18 patients with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who were treated with an oral anti-HER1/
HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01937689). ctDNA was assayed
by gene-panel target-capture next-generation sequencing.
Conclusions: Longitudinal gene-panel ctDNA sequencing could be exploited to
determine resistance and guide the precise administration of anti-HER2 targeted
therapy in the metastatic setting.

radiological imaging may be inconclusive and fail to rapidly

incurable, poses a major challenge to the management of
breast cancer. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2

detect drug resistance. In addition, it is clinically crucial to
identify resistance-conferring genomic events, particularly
in heavily treated cases, so as to disclose actionable targets
for subsequent therapy. Tumor genotyping by repeated
tissue biopsies is subjected to spatial selection bias [6, 7] and
precluded by complications associated with this procedure
[8]. Hence, non-invasive biomarkers that can be utilized to
monitor the disease in real-time and molecularly characterize
drug resistance are urgently needed.
The clinical application of circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) as a “liquid biopsy” has been investigated in recent
years [9]. ctDNA, which carries tumor-specific genetic
alterations, is shed by tumor cells into the bloodstream
and represents only a small fraction of cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) [10, 11]. ctDNA can be employed to monitor
tumor dynamics in multiple malignancies including breast
cancer [12, 13]. In a proof-of-concept study, Dawson et al
evaluated ctDNA in serially collected blood samples from
patients with MBC and determined that ctDNA exhibited
greater correlation with changes in tumor burden than
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and CA15-3 [14]. Moreover,
it is feasible to capture resistance to targeted therapy, either
intrinsic or acquired, and determine the molecular basis by
profiling ctDNA in cancer [15–18].
However, most studies incorporating ctDNA assay
into disease monitoring interrogated only one or a few
genes and failed to develop workable criteria to inform
clinical practice. Multigene mechanisms have been
implicated in resistance to HER2 blockade agents [19–22].
Hence we hypothesized that serial gene-panel sequencing
of ctDNA would be sensitive and accurate in identifying
therapeutic resistance. The current study was conducted in
the setting of a prospective clinical trial which evaluated
the safety and efficacy of pyrotinib in HER2-positive
MBC [23]. Pyrotinib is a novel small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) which has irreversible inhibitory
capacity towards HER1 and HER2. Patients who had been
previously exposed to anti-HER2 TKIs were excluded
from the trial. Preliminary data showed its manageable
toxicity and promising anti-tumor activity, with an overall
objective response rate (ORR) of 52.8% and median
progression-free survival (PFS) of 35.3 weeks [23].
We exploited ctDNA from serially collected samples to
identify resistance-related tumor genetic alterations and
made an initial attempt to establish ctDNA-based criteria
to detect resistance to anti-HER2 therapy.

from the current analysis. 52 prospectively collected
plasma samples and temporally matched peripheral blood
cells were assayed for somatic genomic alterations by
target-capture next-generation sequencing (NGS). A
panel of 368 genes was interrogated in the present study
(Supplementary Table S2). The average sequencing
coverage depth of 52 plasma samples was 704-fold,
and the coverage rate of the target region was >99%
(Supplementary Table S3).

RESULTS

Serial monitoring of genome alterations in
ctDNA

Identification of somatic genome alterations
We identified copy number variants (CNVs) in
17 out of 18 (94.4%) patients and in 33 of 52 (63.5%)
plasma samples by analyzing the sequencing data for
plasma matched with blood cells from the same patient
(Supplementary Table S4). Amplification of the ERBB2
gene, which encodes the HER2 protein, was predominant
and identified in 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients and 20 of 52
(38.5%) plasma samples. In addition, ctDNA sequencing
identified other less common CNVs in the study
population. Elevated levels of CDK12 were present
in 6 of 52 plasma samples (11.5%), all of which were
characterized by ERBB2 and CDK12 co-amplification.
Moreover, deletions of the NFKBIA and HLA-A genes
were recurrently captured in 6 (11.5%) and 5 (9.6%)
samples. Amplification of GAB2 and RPS6KB1 was
detected in the baseline plasma of 2 patients (GAB2
for No. 7 and RPS6KB1 for No. 16) but not in samples
collected thereafter.
Point mutations in breast cancer-related genes were
present in 49 of 52 (94.2%) plasma samples and all 18
patients (Supplementary Table S5). Mutations in the
hotspot genes TP53 and PIK3CA were recurrently detected
in 8 (44.4%) and 7 (27.8%) patients, respectively. Variants
in other frequently mutated genes, i.e., ATM/BRCA2/
ERBB2, were also identified. We also captured rarely
documented somatic mutations in the genes CDK12, ROS1
and TSC2. CDK12 is a key regulator of transcription and
has been correlated with homologous recombination (HR)
repair defects in ovarian cancer [24]. A nonsense mutation
in CDK12 (c.3724C>T, p.R1242*) was identified in the
baseline and second cycle plasma of patient No. 12.
In summary, somatic genomic alterations in ctDNA
including CNVs and point mutations were identified in 50
of 52 (96.2%) blood samples and all 18 patients (100%).

Patients and samples

As is always true in administration of anti-HER2
targeted therapy, it’s crucial to evaluate the status of HER2
amplification before initiation of treatment. At baseline
we identified HER2 amplification in only 9 of 18 patients
(50.0%) who presented with HER2-positive tumors
at diagnosis by histologic review. The status of HER2

In total, 18 patients (Supplementary Table S1)
whose diseases were histologically confirmed as HER2
positive before enrollment were evaluated in the present
study. The other participants of the clinical trial who

together with patient No.3 indicated that ctDNA assays
might provide early detection of resistance compared with
conventional methods. Shown in panels C (patient No.17),
D (patient No.5) and E (patient No.8) is the concurrent
detection of notable increase in HER2 copy number and
tumor burden, regardless of HER2 status at baseline.
Moreover, dynamic profiling of somatic mutations in
ctDNA identified intra-tumor heterogeneity and resistancemediating mechanisms. For example, in a patient (No.
5, Figure 1F) diagnosed with multiple liver and bone
metastases, a set of gene mutations (BRCA2, MSH5 and
TSC2) dominated in the baseline plasma while the fraction
of PIK3CA mutation was low. Subsequent analysis of the
plasma collected prior to the establishment of progressive
disease revealed diverging patterns in the fractions of
mutated genes, with an evident increase in the PIK3CA
mutation level and moderate decrease in the levels of
previously dominant genes. These changes indicated that
they derived from different subclones and thus added
evidence of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Importantly, we
identified much more mutations in the C2 sample than at
baseline, with a noticeable rise in the fractions of mutated
TP53 and FLT1 (Figure 1F), which suggested the increase
of clonal heterogeneity at the metastatic sites. Elevation in
the level of PIK3CA mutation as well as subclonity might
account for the observed immediate resistance to targeted
therapy.

amplification at baseline was not informative because we
failed to observe an association between initial ctDNA
assay results and the best response achieved. Nevertheless,
by comparing the performance of serial ctDNA assays
with that of consecutive radiological assessments we
found that the dynamics of HER2 copy number rather
than baseline HER2 amplification status correlated with
response to targeted therapy in the real-time management
of MBC.
Patient No. 3 is illustrative of the relationship between
HER2 copy number dynamics and outcome (Figure 1A).
HER2 amplified copies were not identified in the ctDNA
prior to treatment and remained undetectable after cycle 2
(C2), which coincided with a slight decrease in the tumor
load. However, a notable rise in the HER2 copy number
was captured after C4, which further increased until the
clinical establishment of disease progression after C6. In
other words, monitoring for drug resistance via HER2 CNV
dynamics in ctDNA provided 8 weeks’ lead time compared
with conventional imaging methods.
The relationship between fluctuation patterns of
HER2 CNV and tumor dynamics was also observed in
other cases which were demonstrated in Figure 1 (panel
B, C, D, E). For patient No.2 (Figure 1B), the tumor
load moderately decreased after C2 whereas HER2 copy
number was elevated in the ctDNA, which was followed
by immediate disease progression after C4. This case

Figure 1: Serial monitoring of genomic alterations in ctDNA. (panel A, patient No.3) A typical case illustrates the relationship

between fluctuation patterns of HER2 copy number (right Y axis) and dynamics of tumor load (left Y axis). Notably, HER2 amplification
in ctDNA was identified 8 weeks earlier than the clinical establishment of disease progression by CT. (panel B, patient No.2) The tumor
load moderately decreased after C2 whereas HER2 copy number was elevated, which was followed by immediate disease progression after
C4. (panel C, patient No.17; panel D, patient No.5; panel E, patient No.8) Notable increase in HER2 copy number and tumor burden
was concurrently detected, regardless of HER2 status at baseline. (panel F, patient No.5) Dynamic ctDNA profiling revealed intra-tumor
heterogeneity and clonal evolution, as evidenced by the diverging patterns of fluctuation in identified mutations. The left Y axis refers to the
allele fractions of mutations in genes TSC2/MSH5/BRAC2 and the right Y axis to genes PIK3CA/FLT1/TP53.

landscape, which may be exploited to elucidate the tumor
genomic response and monitor resistance to targeted
therapy. The findings of the present and previous studies
indicate that the predictive power of a single-genebased ctDNA assay is limited in monitoring response to
treatment. Here, we proposed a set of combined criteria
that could be adopted to identify resistance to HER1/
HER2 blockade in HER2-positive MBC. Drug resistance
should be indicated during treatment if any of the
following situations applies: 1) recurrence or persistence
of HER2 amplification in the blood; 2) emergence or
≥20% increase in the fraction of mutations in any of these
resistance-related genes including TP53/PIK3CA/MTOR/
PTEN. We set the threshold value for the increase of AF as
20% after allowing for the margin of error in ctDNA assay.
Table 2 compares the performance of ctDNA
profiling of 34 plasma samples with that of temporally
matched CT scans. Specifically, ctDNA analysis utilizing
the combined criteria was a highly sensitive approach
(sensitivity 85.7%) to detect drug resistance confirmed
by CT. However, the relatively low specificity (55.0%) of
this method should be interpreted with caution because
the discordant evaluations (progression by ctDNA/nonprogression by CT, false positivity) were ascribed to the
inefficient reflection of tumor response by CT in some
cases. After adjusting for this caveat in cases in which
ctDNA assay identified resistance earlier than CT (N=6),
we obtained a concordance rate up to 82.1%, confirming
the robustness of this approach.
Subsequently we sought to explore the prognostic
value of ctDNA-based criteria in HER2-positive metastatic
disease. Notably, patients with resistance determined
by C2 ctDNA results displayed significantly shorter
PFS (median 8.5 vs. 32.4 weeks, p=0.0007, Figure 4),
suggesting the discriminating role of ctDNA criteria in the
prognosis of MBC. The present study is not yet powered
to prove that ctDNA-based criteria outperforms Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), which
should be addressed in future study with larger cohorts.

Events of progressive disease occurred in 14 of 18
patients, and primary therapeutic resistance was identified
in 6 of them (6/14, 42.9%). For the subset of patients with
primary resistance (n=6), the results of pre- and posttreatment ctDNA assays were compared so as to generate
clues about the sources of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy.
First and foremost, HER2 amplification in ctDNA
concurred with disease progression in 4 patients (4/6,
66.7%) irrespective of HER2 status at baseline. However,
we failed to capture HER2 amplification in the ctDNA
of the other two patients when a definite increase in the
tumor burden was recognized, indicating the role of other
resistance-conferring mechanisms. As summarized in Table
1, somatic mutations in gene TP53 were identified in 3 of
6 patients (50.0%) with primary resistance to anti-HER2
therapy. Other putative mechanisms included variants
in genes implicated in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway, i.e. PIK3CA/PTEN/MTOR (3/6, 50.0%).
With regards to the patients with acquired resistance
(N=8), serial ctDNA sequencing has revealed similar
findings. HER2 amplification was identified in 7 of 8
patients. When the tumors responded to the therapy (SD/
PR) HER2 amplified copies were infrequently detected
(3/14 samples, 21.4%), whereas at disease progression
HER2 amplification was present in ctDNA in 4 out of 7
samples (4/7, 57.1%). All of the patients had mutations
detected. The most frequent mutations identified were
PIK3CA/PTEN/MTOR (5/8, 62.5%), followed by TP53
(4/8, 50%). Fluctuations in allele fraction (AF) of dominant
mutations generally correlated with tumor burden reflected
by imaging method, with increased AF concurring with or
even preluding disease progression (Figure 2).
Together, based on the dominant markers of
resistance described above, we identified 4 patterns of
change in ctDNA at the onset of resistance to anti-HER2
therapy as shown by Figure 3. Among the patients with
primary or acquired drug resistance (N=14), 5 patients
(35.7%) exhibited concurring HER2 amplification
and mutations in genes TP53/PIK3CA/MTOR/PTEN.
Alterations in these genes have been previously
demonstrated to correlate with resistance to HER2 targeted
therapeutics. In 8 patients either HER2 amplification (N=3,
21.4%) or mutations in the genes specified above (N=5,
35.7%) were detected in the ctDNA at disease progression.
There was one patient (No. 6) displaying neither HER2
amplification nor important mutations but we captured a
mutation in RSP14 prior to progression which might be
associated with treatment failure.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrated that ctDNA
genotyping using serially collected samples was an
efficient and inherently specific approach to monitor
resistance to targeted agent administration and identify
emerging mechanisms of resistance in HER2-positive
MBC. Compared with previous research, our study is
the first to propose ctDNA-based criteria to determine
resistance to HER1/HER2 blockade. We also made an
initial attempt to investigate the tumor genomic response
to anti-HER2 targeted therapy by ctDNA genotyping in
the setting of a prospective clinical trial.
For patients with metastatic disease, it’s clinically
important to precisely determine response and timely
detect drug resistance. In this prospective study, we
exploited longitudinal analysis of ctDNA to monitor

resistance to HER1/HER2 blockade. We found that the
dynamics of HER2 CNVs rather than baseline HER2
amplification status closely correlated with response to
anti-HER2 therapy. Recurrence or persistence of HER2
amplified copies in the blood heralded resistance-related
disease progression.
Nevertheless, the above-described pattern of HER2
CNV fluctuation was not captured in a considerable
fraction of patients (6/14, 42.9%). We adopted targetcapture NGS to characterize alterations in a panel of
breast cancer-related genes and revealed resistance-related
events other than HER2 CNVs. Putative mechanisms
underpinning resistance to anti-HER2 therapy included
up-regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [20],
PTEN mutation or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) [19,
20], accumulation of the p95 isoform of HER2 [25],
signaling from HER family receptors [22] and insulin-like
growth factor receptor [26, 27] and activation of estrogen
receptor signaling [21]. Here we exploited pre- and posttreatment ctDNA profiling and found that mutations in
TP53 and genes in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway were
heavily involved in resistance to HER1/HER2 blockade,
adding evidence for the crucial role of these plausible
mechanisms. Intriguingly, we also detected a moderate
level of CDK12/ERBB2 co-amplification in resistant cases,
but the biological relevance of this observation warrants
further exploration.
Given that the agent used in our study is a dual
EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, one important issue should be
highlighted concerning the predictive value of EGFR
alteration. Here alteration in gene EGFR (amplification)
was identified in only one sample (patient No. 3, at
disease progression). The very low detection rate of EGFR
alteration (1/18, 5.6%) has prevented further exploration
of its predictive value in our study. Previous findings
indicated that EGFR mutations were rare if not absent in
breast cancer [28, 29] and thus not a suitable predictor for
anti-EGFR targeted therapy. Data on EGFR amplification
rates in breast carcinomas has been inconsistent ranging
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from 0.8-28% [30–32]. Clinical trials evaluating the
efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy in breast cancer have
revealed disappointing outcomes [33–35], and correlative
studies suggested that EGFR expression/amplification
status was not a significant predictor [33, 35]. However,
whether limited presence of EGFR amplification in ctDNA
could predict resistance to dual EGFR/HER2 blockade has
yet to be elucidated in future studies.
Our findings have several important implications.
First, we demonstrated the clinical utility and validity
of serial ctDNA profiling in precise delivery of targeted
therapy in HER2-positive MBC. Based on our data,
resistance to targeted therapy in HER2-positive MBC
should be noted if ctDNA profiling reveals recurrence or
persistence of CNVs in HER2, or increase in the fraction
of certain mutations. These combined criteria exemplify
how ctDNA sequencing data can be interpreted to
determine drug resistance, which we expect to be useful in
the management of various metastatic cancers. Although
what degree of change is sufficient to cause shift in clinical
management still merits further study, the results derived
herein could at least provide hints for rational design of
customized ctDNA assays in the future.
Besides, as a multiplex biomarker another
purpose of ctDNA sequencing was to identify emerging
mechanisms of resistance and propose candidate drug
targets for salvage treatment. For example, regarding
patients with obvious increase in the fraction of PI3KCA
mutation before progression, predominant growth of
PIK3CA mutation-carrying clone probably resulted in
treatment failure and PI3K signaling blockade might be
the optimal remedy for subsequent management.
Of note, our data convincingly demonstrated the
validity of tumor clonal evolution theory. In some cases,
we observed discordant patterns of change in somatic
genomic mutations, suggesting that these mutations
originated from different subclones and the selective
pressure of therapeutic intervention finally led to the
expansion of resistant clones. Genetic diversification as

exemplified by an increase in clonal heterogeneity also
promotes the territorial expansion of the tumor. Serial
ctDNA analysis substantiated the reiterative and adaptive
process of clonal evolution and provided further insights
into disease biology.
The present research features several improvements
over previous studies. First and foremost, earlier ctDNA
studies were mostly retrospective and based on small
cohorts, and the patients were treated with a mixture of
various chemotherapeutic regimens, which precluded
rational inter-study comparisons [36–39]. Conversely,
our study was conducted in the setting of a prospective
clinical trial, and the study population was uniformly
exposed to anti-HER2 targeted therapy. Therefore, the
major findings derived from our study would better fit
into the practice and guide the optimal administration of
HER2 blocking agents in HER2-positive MBC. Second,
our study represents an initial attempt to propose a set of
ctDNA-based criteria that can be readily used to assess
resistance to HER2-targeted therapy during treatment.
This actually helped narrow the gap between bench and
bedside and further confirmed the clinical validity and
utility of ctDNA profiling.
Despite the advantages delineated above, several
limitations of our study should be noted. To start with,
HER2 amplification was identified by ctDNA assay
in only 13 of 18 patients at any time point, resulting in
a relatively low concordance rate with tumor HER2
status (13/18, 72.2%). Although different timing of
tissue (primary lesion) and plasma sampling (metastatic
setting) may partly account for the disconcordance,
possible methodological concerns were still explored.
The sensitivity of the ctDNA assay might not suffice to
accurately detect copy number variants which could be
addressed in future study by improving the coverage
depth of sequencing. This poor concordance could also
be attributed to other technical issues such as inadequate
plasma available for assay and high background levels of
circulating wild-type DNA. Secondly, the threshold value
for the degree of increase in the fraction of mutations was
laid down at 20% so that optimal sensitivity/specificity of
the ctDNA-based criteria could be derived, in a somewhat
arbitrary way. The level of alteration in somatic mutations
sufficient to initiate a change in clinical management needs
to be specified in large-scale prospective trials. Thirdly,
a comparison of genomic data from non-treated HER2positive breast cancer patients is lacking, to be able to get
a perspective of the therapy effect in driving HER2 CNVs
and vice versa. Moreover, the small number of evaluable
patients prevented rigorous statistical analysis, so the
present study was less powered to arrive at statistically
sound conclusions. Our findings derived from this proofof-principle study, which represent a logical evolution in
the field of ctDNA, warrant further validation in larger
series of patients.

Patients and sample collection
Blood samples were prospectively collected from
patients with HER2-positive MBC who participated in
a clinical trial (NCT01937689) evaluating the safety and
efficacy of pyrotinib, an oral anti-HER1/HER2 tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, which was administered daily on a 28
d/cycle regimen [23]. All enrolled patients provided
written informed consent for serial blood collection and
sample assay. The study was approved by the institutional
review board of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences. Blood samples were collected before
the initiation of treatment and after every two cycles of
therapy until disease progression. Plasma was separated
by centrifugation at 1,600 g for 10 min at 4°C and the
supernatant was then centrifuged for a second time
at 16,000g for 10 min at 4°C to remove the cellular
components. Both plasma and peripheral blood cells were
aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until ctDNA and genomic
DNA (gDNA) extraction. In order to prevent lysis of white
blood cell and thus preserve the integrity of ctDNA, blood
samples were processed and frozen within 2 hours of
sample collection.

DNA extraction
ctDNA and gDNA were extracted using the QIAamp
Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) and QIAamp DNA
Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) respectively, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. ctDNA was sequenced to
detect somatic alterations, whereas gDNA was adopted as
normal control.

Target capture and next-generation sequencing
A total of 368 genes were selected from four
sources: 1) known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes;
2) genes that are targets of agents approved by the FDA or
have been assessed in clinical trials; 3) genes implicated
in major cancer-related signaling pathways; 4) genes
identified in the findings of the TCGA network which
covers 12 cancer types. The target-capture region was 1.9
Mb in size and designed for all exons from 368 genes.
Sequencing libraries were prepared from ctDNA using
KAPA DNA Library Preparation Kits (Kapa Biosystems,
Inc.), and gDNA sequencing libraries were prepared
using the protocols recommended by the Illumina TruSeq
DNA Library Preparation Kit. For samples close to the
minimum input requirement, additional pre-capture PCR
cycles were performed to generate sufficient PCR product
for hybridization. The libraries were hybridized to the
1.9-Mb custom-designed probes (NimbleGen, Roche)
of biotinylated oligonucleotides. DNA sequencing was
performed on a HiSeq2500 sequencing system (Illumina,
66028

Oncotarget

San Diego, CA) with 2*101 bp paired-end reads. The
reads were aligned to the human genome build GRCh37
using BWA (a Burrows–Wheeler aligner). Somatic single
nucleotide variant (sSNV) and indel calls were generated
using MuTect and GATK, respectively. Somatic copy
number alterations were identified with CONTRA (COpy
Number Targeted Resequencing Analysis, Supplementary
Figure S1).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

All variants identified by the bioinformatics pipeline
were manually reviewed by an experienced bioinformatics
director to assess the quality of base calls, the mapping
quality of the reads, and the overall read depth at the site.
Variations meeting any of the criteria listed below were
filtered: low base quality (Phred score <13) in all reads
supporting the variation; mutant reads all in the plus or
minus strand; all the reads with mutant allele did not meet
mapping confidently (quality score >=30); reads support at
variant position <3; and variants detected near the start/end
of sequencing reads. For a given variant in plasma ctDNA,
allele fraction = sequencing read count of alternate alleles
/ (sequencing read count of reference alleles + sequencing
read count of alternate alleles) *100%.

Tumor burden was measured as the sum of the
largest diameters of the target lesions. Clinical response
was evaluated every two cycles as per RECIST v1.1
[40]. Primary resistance referred to disease progression
on the first restaging CT scan, while acquired resistance
was defined as progression after initial response to
HER2 targeted therapy. PFS was defined as the interval
between the initiation of treatment and the date of disease
progression or death from any cause. Cases without
progression or death events were censored at the date
of last follow-up. Survival curves were estimated using
the Kaplan–Meier method and unadjusted comparison of
these estimates was performed using log-rank test. We
assessed the clinical utility of ctDNA assay in monitoring
drug resistance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and
concordance rate. Using temporally paired plasma samples
and CT scans, the concordance rate was defined as the
number of consistent evaluations by ctDNA assay and CT
out of the total number of evaluations (N=34). Sensitivity
was calculated as the proportion of progression events
decided by both ctDNA assay and CT scans among all the
progression events established by CT (N=14). Specificity
referred to the percentage of non-progression evaluations
determined by both ctDNA assay and CT scans in total
non-progression evaluations assessed by CT (N=20).
All reported p values were two-sided, and p<0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Company,
Chicago, IL).
