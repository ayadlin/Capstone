BACKGROUND: Chemoresistance is the major factor limiting long-term treatment success in patients with epithelial
ovarian cancers. Most cytotoxic drugs kill cells through apoptosis; therefore, defective execution of apoptotic pathways results in a drug-resistant phenotype in many tumor types. METHODS: A panel of ovarian cancer cell lines was
screened for expression and function of the apoptosome components Apaf-1 and caspase-9. Expression levels were
analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting; Apaf-1 function was determined by assessing the ability of
endogenous Apaf-1 to cleave caspase-9 in the presence or absence of cytochrome c. The effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A on Apaf-1 expression and function was evaluated. RESULTS: The authors report here
that the resistance of ovarian cancer cells to the proapoptotic effects of chemotherapy is due in part to deficient
Apaf-1 activity. Although Apaf-1 is expressed in most ovarian cancers, the functional activity is impaired, as Apaf-1 has
a diminished ability to recruit and activate caspase-9. Treatment of ovarian cancer cells with trichostatin A results in
restoration of Apaf-1 function independent of alterations in Apaf-1 expression. Furthermore, treating chemoresistant
cells with sublethal doses of trichostatin A restores Apaf-1 function and sensitizes cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting intrinsic pathway defects for therapeutic intervention may result in sensitizing tumors to
standard chemotherapy or triggering apoptosis in the absence of other apoptotic signals. The identification of drugs
that can use Apaf-1 when it is present, yet can overcome its functional inactivation, may be an important clinical

Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death among patients with gynecological cancers in the United
States. It is the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death in women, and >15,000 women die of this disease annually.
Although the majority of tumors initially respond to chemotherapy, most patients die of chemoresistant, recurrent disease.
Despite improved treatment success for many malignancies during the recent era in clinical oncology, the 5-year survival
for patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer remains <50%.1
Chemoresistance is the principal factor limiting long-term treatment success in ovarian carcinoma patients. Chemoresistance has been associated with the failure of chemotherapy drugs to induce apoptosis. Chemotherapeutic agents, such
as cisplatin, induce apoptosis by engaging multiple signaling pathways that converge on the mitochondria to cause release
of cytochrome c. In the presence of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP)/adenosine triphosphate, cytochrome c binds to
Apaf-1, which then oligomerizes and binds procaspase-9. The cytochrome c–Apaf-1–caspase-9 complex (apoptosome)
enables enzymatic self-activation of caspase-9 that subsequently activates procaspase-3, ultimately resulting in apoptotic
cell death.2
Previously, we demonstrated that the majority of primary ovarian tumors and chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cell
lines express detectable levels of the 3 proteins that constitute the apoptosome, but appear to have deficient apoptosome
activity. Moreover, apoptosome dysfunction was associated with chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma in vitro, leading
us to hypothesize that it contributes to the chemoresistant phenotype associated with ovarian carcinoma clinically.3
In this study, we demonstrate that dysfunctional apoptosome activation in ovarian carcinoma is due to deficient
Apaf-1 function. Although endogenous Apaf-1 expression levels are not predictive of apoptotic response to chemotherapy,

exogenous Apaf-1 restored apoptosome function in in
vitro assays. Formation of the apoptosome in chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cells is impaired by diminished
binding between Apaf-1 and procaspase-9. Of potential
therapeutic importance, we show that treating ovarian
carcinoma cells with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A, increases both the expression and activity of Apaf-1. HDAC inhibitor can affect gene
expression as well as the functional properties of a variety
of nonhistone proteins by regulating the balance of acetylated protein residues.4 Trichostatin A treatment was
found to sensitize chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cells
to cisplatin, independently trigger apoptosis, and result in
enhanced binding between Apaf-1 and caspase-9. Furthermore, we found that trichostatin A treatment resulted
in increased Apaf-1 activity independent of alterations in
Apaf-1 expression. Together, these results identify Apaf-1
dysfunction as a specific cause of chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma, and provide initial evidence that the pharmacodynamic response to trichostatin A specifically
overcomes this mechanism of chemoresistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Reagents
Trichostatin A5 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St Louis, Mo). Cisplatin was obtained
from Ben Venue Labs (Bedford, Ohio).
Cell Lines and Tumor Samples
Normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) cells were harvested from fresh normal human ovarian surgical specimens and cultured in medium (M199:MCDB105 [1:1]
with 10% fetal bovine serum). Wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and MEF Apaf-1 / cells were
a generous gift from Dr. M. Soengas (University of Michigan). The remaining ovarian carcinoma cell lines were
obtained from Dr. K. Cho (University of Michigan).
Tissue microarrays were constructed using 302 cores
from 86 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma and 25
cores from benign ovarian samples. Tumors were histopathologically classified according to the International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics criteria. The
histology of tumors in the ovarian carcinoma microarray
included papillary serous (52%), endometrioid (9%),
clear cell (9%), undifferentiated (3%), and mixed histology (27%). Clinicopathologic and demographic data
were collected from medical records under an institutional

review board-approved protocol (IRBMED # 20040814).
All hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides of
the tumors were reviewed, and areas of tumor were identified. Two to 3 tissue cores per tumor were taken from spatially separate areas in a single donor block from each case
using a tissue microarrayer (Chemicon Advanced Tissue
Arrayer; Chemicon International, Temecula, Calif).
Cores were arrayed into a recipient block at predetermined coordinates. The H&E-stained sections from donor and recipient paraffin blocks were used to confirm the
area of tumor from which cores were retrieved.
For immunohistochemistry, 5 lM thick sections
were cut from the respective arrays, deparaffinized, and
dehydrated. Immunohistochemical staining for Apaf-1
was performed using a streptavidin peroxidase procedure.
Antigen-bound primary antibody was detected using
standard avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex
(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).
Cytoplasmic expression of Apaf-1 in epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells was determined quantitatively by evaluating the proportion of positive tumor cells over total
tumor cells, independent of intensity, as previously
described.6,7 Positivity was scored as follows: negative
(score ¼ 1, no visible staining), weak (score ¼ 2, <25%
of cells staining), moderate (score ¼ 3, 25%-75% of cells
staining), and strong (score ¼ 4, >75% of cells staining).
All scoring was performed by a single observer.
The association of Apaf-1 with response to platinum-based chemotherapy (interval between completion
of adjuvant chemotherapy and date of first recurrence)
was evaluated using 2-sample t tests. All analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).
Flow Cytometry Analysis
Cells were stained with propidium iodide, and percentage
of apoptotic cells was determined as described previously.8
Analysis was performed using Lysis II software on a
FACScan flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson, Mountain
View, Calif).
Immunoblotting and Coimmunoprecipitation
For the preparation of S100 cytosolic lysates, cells were
lysed in Buffer A isotonic lysis buffer as previously
described.3 After incubation with secondary antibody, the
reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence
using the Luminol Reagent kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) and exposed to film (Denville

RESULTS
Apaf-1 Expression Levels Are Not Predictive
of Apoptosome Function
The development of resistance to chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis limits our ability to treat patients with advanced

786

or recurrent ovarian carcinoma. Apoptotic stimuli such as
cisplatin stimulates mitochondrial release of cytochrome
c, which then complexes with the cytosolic factor Apaf-1.
Apaf-1 then binds and activates caspases 9 and 3, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death. We hypothesized
that expression levels of Apaf-1 would be predictive of
clinical response to cisplatin in ovarian carcinoma
patients. We found that Apaf-1 expression was high in the
majority of ovarian tumors analyzed by immunohistochemistry (86 tumors, representative data shown in Fig.
1A); however, expression levels did not correlate with
response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy clinically (data
not shown). All patients underwent staging surgery followed by adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
Response to cisplatin was determined by measuring the
interval between completion of adjuvant chemotherapy
and date of first recurrence (disease-free interval). Recurrence was defined as a rise in Ca-125 and/or measurable
disease prompting reinitiation of chemotherapy. Patients
were placed into 2 categories: platinum sensitive (diseasefree interval >6 months) or platinum resistant (diseasefree interval <6 months). Apaf-1 expression levels were

uniformly high (3-4þ) among platinum-sensitive and
platinum-resistant patients.
Next, we screened a panel of ovarian carcinoma cell
lines for Apaf-1 expression by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B).
With the exception of 2 cell lines (SKOV3 and OVCAR
5), all cell lines had similar expression levels of Apaf-1. Six
representative cell lines were incubated with cisplatin, and
apoptotic response was assessed (Fig. 1C). Consistent
with the data in human tumor samples, expression levels
of Apaf-1 did not correlate with response to cisplatin
in vitro.
Because total expression levels of Apaf-1 were not
predictive of apoptotic response to cisplatin, we hypothesized that Apaf-1 function was altered in the chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cells. We have previously
demonstrated that Apaf-1 multimerization in vitro in
response to cytochrome c/dATP was equivalent between
chemoresistant SKOV3 and chemosensitive A2780 cells.3
We reevaluated Apaf-1 multimerization in 4 additional
chemoresistant cell lines (OVCA4, OVCA429,
OVCA432, ES2) by separating Apaf-1 monomers and
oligomers after cytochrome c/dATP activation using gel
filtration chromatography. The results shown in Figure
1D demonstrate that in all chemoresistant cells, Apaf-1
formed an oligomer in a cytochrome c/dATP-dependent
manner, similar to the chemosensitive cells (A2780). As
expected, in the absence of cytochrome c/dATP, Apaf-1
eluted in monomeric form in all cell lines (Fig. 1D and
data not shown).
Apaf-1–Caspase-9 Binding Is Abnormal in
Cells With Dysfunctional Apoptosome Activity
Although Apaf-1 expression levels and ability to form
oligomers is similar in chemoresistant and chemosensitive
ovarian cancer cell lines, it is not known whether Apaf-1–
caspase-9 binding also occurs with equal efficiency in
these cell lines. Cytosolic extracts from chemosensitive
(A2780) and chemoresistant (OVCA4, OVCA429,
OVCA432, ES-2, SKOV3) cells were activated with
cytochrome c/dATP, and binding interaction between
caspase-9 and Apaf-1 was determined. After immunoprecipitating caspase-9 from cytosolic extracts, the resulting
immune complexes were resolved and blotted to detect
coimmunoprecipitated Apaf-1. All cell lines expressed
similar endogenous levels of Apaf-1 with the exception of
SKOV3 (Fig. 1B). Compared with the chemosensitive
A2780 cell line, reduced levels of Apaf-1 were coimmunoprecipitated with caspase-9 in each of the chemoresistant
cell line extracts (Fig. 2A). Although expression levels of

Cancer

February 15, 2011

immunoprecipitated procaspase-9 are similar across all
cell lines, there are reduced levels of activated or cleaved
caspase-9 in the chemoresistant cells as compared with
A2780. The absence of a reliable antibody to immunoprecipitate Apaf-1 precluded our ability to test Apaf-1/caspase-9 binding in the reverse direction. Nevertheless,
these results suggest that in chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines, binding of Apaf-1 to procaspase-9 is
impaired.
To further evaluate Apaf-1 function, we prepared
cytosolic extracts from 23 ovarian cancer cell lines and
tested the ability of endogenous Apaf-1 to activate procaspase-9 in response to cytochrome c in vitro (Fig. 2B).
Apaf-1 function was assayed by determining the cleavage
of in vitro translated, (35S)-labeled procaspase-9 (Fig. 2B)
and procaspase-3 (data not shown) into the proteolytic
fragments p37/35 and p19/17, respectively, in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP. We identified 6 cell lines
(OVCA429, OVCA432, ES-2, OVCA-4, OVCA10,
SKOV3) that demonstrated diminished ability to activate
and cleave procaspase-9 in response to cytochrome c/
dATP (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the inability of the 6 cell
lines to cleave procaspase-9 in response to cytochrome c/
dATP, these cells also display diminished Apaf-1/caspase9 binding (Fig. 2A) and are resistant to cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 1C).
Caspase-9 Function Is Normal in Ovarian
Carcinoma Cells
Reduced binding of Apaf-1 with caspase-9 in chemoresistant cells is not associated with reduced levels of Apaf-1 or
caspase-9. This suggests that Apaf-1 or caspase-9 in these
cells is dysfunctional, or that these cells contain inhibitors
that suppress the interaction between Apaf-1 and caspase9, and potentially the activation of caspase-9. To test caspase-9 function in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells, we
immunodepleted caspase-9 from the chemosensitive cell
line A2780 (A2780-IPC9). In these assays, cleavage of
(35S)-procaspase-3 was used as a marker of apoptosome
activity. Procaspase-3 is a substrate of activated caspase-9,
and its cleavage in response to cytochrome c and dATP is
exclusively dependent on caspase-9. As expected, A2780
lysates immunodepleted of caspase-9, as well as chemoresistant OVCA429 and SKOV3 lysates, were unable to
activate and cleave in vitro translated (35S)-procaspase-3
(Fig. 3A, lanes 1-2, 5-6, and 11-12, respectively). We next
determined that cytochrome c/dATP-dependent apoptosome activity could be completely restored in A2780IPC9 lysates with the addition of lysates from A2780,

lines and normal ovarian epithelial cells (OSE) were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-procaspase-9 in the presence or absence of cytochrome c and dATP as indicated. After 30 minutes of incubation, 35S-procaspase-9 and its cleavage products p37/

OVCA429, and SKOV3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-8, 9-10, and
13-14 as compared with lanes 1-2). These results show
that procaspase-9 is equivalent in chemosensitive (A2780)
and chemoresistant (OVCA429 and SKOV3) cells, and
suggest that Apaf-1 function is altered in the chemoresistant cell lines.
Apaf-1 Function Is Impaired in Ovarian
Carcinoma
To test Apaf-1 function in the chemoresistant ovarian cell
lines, we used cytosolic lysates made from MEFs containing wild-type (WT) Apaf-1, or that were Apaf-1 null
(MEF Apaf-1 /). As expected, cytosolic extracts from
WT MEF and A2780 cells could be induced to cleave

788

in vitro translated (35S)-procaspase-3 by adding cytochrome c and dATP (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-2 and 5-6), whereas
extracts from MEF Apaf-1 /, OVCA429 and SKOV3
were unable to activate and cleave in vitro translated (35S)procaspase-3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3-4, 7-8, and 9-10, respectively). The addition of WT MEF cytosolic extracts to
MEF Apaf-1 /, OVCA429 and SKOV3 extracts completely restored apoptosome activity (Fig. 3C, lanes 1-2,
5-6, and 7-8, respectively. Lysates from WT MEF or
A2780 cells could restore apoptosome function in MEF
Apaf-1 / cells (Fig. 3D, lanes 1-2, 3-4). However,
lysates from chemoresistant cells OVCA429 and SKOV3
did not restore apoptosome function in MEF Apaf-1 /
extracts (Fig. 3D, lanes 5-6 and 7-8, respectively). These

S-procaspase-3 and its cleavage products, p19/17, were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. (B) S100 cytosolic lysates from wild-type (WT) murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF), MEF Apaf-1 /, A2780, OVCA429, or SKOV3 cells were prepared. Apoptosome function was assayed as indicated
in Panel A. (C) Cytosolic lysates from WT MEF were mixed in a 1: 1 ratio with MEF Apaf-1 /, A2780, OVCA429, or SKOV3 cells,
and apoptosome function was tested as indicated in Panel A. (D) Cytosolic lysates from MEF Apaf-1 / were mixed in a 1:1 ratio
with WT MEF, A2780, OVCA429, or SKOV3 cells, and apoptosome function was tested as indicated in Panel A.

results show that Apaf-1 in OVCA429 and SKOV3
extracts could not complement the specific deficiency in
Apaf-1 in the MEF Apaf-1 / cells, indicating that the
Apaf-1 in these cells is not functional. Although lower levels of Apaf-1 in SKOV3 cells can potentially explain the
findings with these cells, normal levels of Apaf-1 in
OVCA429 cells suggest that Apaf-1 activity is either
inhibited because of post-translational modifications or
by the presence of an inhibitor.
An alternative interpretation of the results shown in
Figure 3 is that addition of WT MEF lysates to lysates prepared from chemoresistant cells (OVCA429 and
SKOV3) resulted in dilution of inhibitory factors, thus
preventing activation of the apoptosome. To rule out the
possibility of an inhibitor against Apaf-1 or caspase-9 in
the chemoresistant cells, we tested cytochrome c/dATPinduced apoptosome function in lysates after supplementing with purified, functional recombinant Apaf-1. Cytosolic lysates prepared from MEF Apaf-1 / cells
required the addition of 3.5 to 7.5 nmol of recombinant

Cancer

February 15, 2011

Apaf-1 to reconstitute cytochrome c/dATP-triggered caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 4A). We found that adding this same
amount of recombinant Apaf-1 restored apoptosome activation in lysates from SKOV3 (Fig. 4B), OVCA4,
OVCA429, OVCA432, and ES2 cells (Fig. 4C), indicated by caspase-3 processing in response to cytochrome c
and dATP. These results argue against the presence of a
soluble inhibitor that interferes with caspase-9–Apaf-1
binding or apoptosome function in the chemoresistant
cells. Thus, although a relative deficiency of Apaf-1 may
be important for chemoresistance in certain ovarian cells
(eg, SKOV3), for other chemoresistant cells with normal
Apaf-1 expression levels, our data are most consistent with
Apaf-1 function being disrupted by post-translational
protein modifications.

Cytosolic S100 lysates from (A) murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) Apaf-1 /, (B) SKOV3, OVCA4, OVCA429, and OVCA432 cells, and (C) ES-2 cells were incubated with various amounts of purified recombinant human Apaf-1 as indicated, and apoptosome function was tested by incubating with

Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography.

investigators found that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
or trichostatin A treatment did not result in increased
Apaf-1 levels in melanoma cells, suggesting that HDAC
inhibitor effects on apoptotic factors may be cell type specific.10 We first evaluated apoptotic response to the
HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A in several representative
ovarian carcinoma cell lines. As shown in Figure 5A, trichostatin A induced apoptosis in 60% to 75% of cells after 48 hours of incubation in both the chemosensitive
(A2780) and chemoresistant (SKOV3 and OVCA4) cells,
as compared with untransformed OSE cells, which
remained viable.
Because the low levels of Apaf-1 expression in
SKOV3 cells are potentially the cause of chemoresistance
in this cell line, we tested whether trichostatin A increases
Apaf-1 expression and restores apoptosome function in
SKOV3 cells. We also examined the response of the chemosensitive cell line A2780 to treatment with trichostatin
A. Trichostatin A (1 lM) treatment resulted in increased
Apaf-1 expression levels in both A2780 and SKOV3 cells
within 5 hours of exposure (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-5 and 11-15,
top panel, respectively), whereas Apaf-1 expression after
trichostatin A treatment remained unchanged in nontransformed ovarian surface epithelial cells (Fig. 5B, lanes
21-25, top panel). Concurrent with the increase in Apaf-1
expression, procaspase-9 expression increased in the
A2780 cell line, proteolytic fragments of processed caspase-9 (p37/35) appeared, and cytochrome c was released
into the cytoplasm in both the A2780 and SKOV3 cell
lines, but not in normal ovarian epithelial cells (Fig. 5B,
lanes 1-5, 11-15, and 21-25, respectively). Thus, trichos-

790

tatin A not only increased Apaf-1 expression but also triggered functional activation of caspase-9 in ovarian cancer
cells. Surprisingly, in the chemosensitive A2780 cell line,
Apaf-1 expression also increased after treatment with cisplatin after 12 hours of treatment, as compared with the
chemoresistant SKOV3 cell line, where Apaf-1 expression
remained unchanged after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A,
lanes 6-10 and 16-20, respectively). As expected, cisplatin
treatment also resulted in activation of procaspase-9 and
release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm in A2780 cells,
and not in the chemoresistant SKOV3 cells (Fig. 5B, lanes
6-10 and 16-20, respectively).
Trichostatin A Enhances Apaf-1 Activity
We next evaluated the effect of trichostatin A treatment
on Apaf-1/caspase-9 binding. Representative ovarian cancer cell lines with dysfunctional apoptosomes (SKOV3,
OVCA4, ES-2) were treated with vehicle control (dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO]) or trichostatin A. Cytosolic
lysates were prepared, and input was normalized for Apaf1 expression (Fig. 5C, top panel). Cytosolic expression of
Apaf-1 was equivalent in 40 lg of DMSO-treated cell
lysates, as compared with 20 lg of trichostatin A-treated
cell lysates. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anticaspase-9 antibody, followed by immunoblotting for
Apaf-1 (lower panel) and caspase-9 (middle panel). As
shown in Figure 5C, the ability of Apaf-1 to bind caspase9 was markedly enhanced in trichostatin A-treated cells as
compared with DMSO-treated cells. Likewise, after controlling for Apaf-1 expression levels, trichostatin A-treated
cells exhibited activation and cleavage of procaspase-9, as

(C) ES-2 cells were preincubated with trichostatin A at indicated concentrations for 12 hours, followed by a 24-hour incubation with cisplatin (Cis). Viability was assessed using Sulforhodamine B assay. All samples were prepared in triplicate, and data

compared with DMSO treated cells, which could not activate/cleave procaspase-9, even in the presence of exogenous cytochrome c/dATP.
We next sought to confirm the effect of trichostatin
A on Apaf-1 activity independent of its effect on Apaf-1
or caspase-9 expression. First, cells with similar endogenous expression levels of Apaf-1 but divergent Apaf-1
function were treated with trichostatin A (1 lM) for 0,
12, and 24 hours. As expected, in the chemosensitive
A2780 cell line, Apaf-1 expression increased, and procaspase-9 was activated/cleaved (Fig. 6A, lanes 1-3). In the
chemoresistant ES-2 cell line, Apaf-1 expression increased
slightly, and procaspase-9 was also activated/cleaved (Fig.
6B, lanes 4-6). Both cell lines were immunodepleted of
caspase-9. As expected, A2780-IPC9 and ES-2-IPC9 cells
were devoid of caspase-9 and remained viable after trichostatin A treatment (Fig. 6B, A2780-IPC9, lanes 7-9
and ES-2-IPC9, lanes 10-12, respectively). Next, lysates
from trichostatin A-treated A2780-IPC9 and ES-2-IPC9
cells were normalized for Apaf-1 expression and were
incubated with in vitro translated caspase-9. Apaf-1 function was determined by adding cytochrome c/dATP and

assessing caspase-9 activation/cleavage. As shown in Figure 6B, trichostatin A enhanced Apaf-1 activity independent of increasing Apaf-1/caspase-9 expression levels,
manifested in increased cleavage of in vitro translated procaspase-9 cleavage in the presence of cytochrome c/dATP.
Because trichostatin A treatment increased Apaf-1
activity in apoptosome-deficient cells, independent of its
effect on Apaf-1 and/or caspase-9 expression, we reasoned
that pretreating chemoresistant cells with trichostatin A
may sensitize cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Representative ES-2 cells were pretreated with a sublethal dose
of trichostatin A (250 nM) for 12 hours, followed by
treatment with cisplatin. Pretreatment with trichostatin A
enhanced cisplatin-induced cell death (Fig. 6C). Cisplatin
treatment alone and sublethal doses of trichostatin A (125
and 250 nM) alone did not induce activation/cleavage of
procaspase-9 (Fig. 6D, lanes 1-3, 4, and 7). Preincubating
cells with trichostatin A for 12 hours followed by cisplatin
for 24 hours resulted in increased activation and cleavage
of procaspase-9 (Fig. 6D, lanes 5-6, 8-9, and 11-12) as
compared with cisplatin treatment alone (Fig. 6D, lanes
2-3). Preincubating cells with sublethal doses of

trichostatin A did not affect Apaf-1 expression (Fig. 6D,
bottom panel). These data suggest that trichostatin A
enhances tumor cell sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
The development of chemoresistance is the major factor
limiting long-term treatment success for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance are poorly understood.
Recent data suggest that dysregulation of apoptosis is a
key contributor to chemoresistance. We previously
showed that the majority of primary ovarian tumors and
chemoresistant ovarian cell lines are deficient in Apaf-1
activity, suggesting that Apaf-1 dysfunction may contribute toward the aggressive, chemoresistant phenotype associated with this disease.3
Inactivation of Apaf-1 and subsequently chemoresistance has been attributed to several factors in other tumor types. Apaf-1 gene methylation and loss of expression
in melanoma and acute myeloblastic leukemia have been
associated with resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.11,12 Low expression levels of Apaf-1 have also been
described in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), where the bulk of
Apaf-1 was found to associate with discrete domains in
the plasma membrane. Disruption of lipid rafts sensitized
BL cells to apoptosis-induced by chemotherapy, suggesting that ectopic (noncytosolic) localization of Apaf-1 may
play a role in chemoresistance in BL.13 Overexpression of
Apaf-1 in melanoma,11 leukemia,13 and cervical14 cancer
cells resulted in activation of caspase-9, indicating that
apoptosome function was restored. Furthermore, expression of Apaf-1 was recently identified as a predictive
marker of response to preoperative radiation therapy in
patients with rectal carcinoma.6
We have shown here that Apaf-1 expression does
not correlate with apoptosome activity or response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian carcinoma. Despite
relatively high expression levels of Apaf-1, several chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines fail to assemble functional apoptosomes. We have previously demonstrated the
lack of Apaf-1 mutations or expression of nonfunctional
isoforms of Apaf-1 in ovarian carcinoma.3 Other possibilities that may contribute toward Apaf-1 inactivation
include the presence of an Apaf-1 inhibitor, or the lack of
an Apaf-1 enhancer in ovarian carcinoma cells. However,
because we could restore apoptosome function in ovarian
carcinoma extracts by mixing them with extracts prepared

from cells with WT Apaf-1, our data suggest the absence of
an Apaf-1 inhibitor. The finding that apoptosome function
was restored after addition of purified recombinant human
Apaf-1 to ovarian carcinoma extracts also suggests that an
Apaf-1 enhancer is not required to stimulate apoptosome
function in ovarian carcinoma cells.
Because recent data suggest that several HDAC
inhibitors in the hydroxamic acid class can regulate
expression of apoptotic genes,9,15 we next investigated the
possibility that trichostatin A could alter Apaf-1 expression and function. Incubation of ovarian carcinoma cells
with trichostatin A resulted in an increase in Apaf-1
expression along with activation and cleavage of procaspase-9. Unexpectedly, incubation of the chemosensitive
cell line A2780 with cisplatin also resulted in increased
Apaf-1 expression, whereas Apaf-1 expression in SKOV3
cells remained unchanged. Cell lysates used for these
experiments were prepared from cytosolic extracts to
avoid contamination with endogenous cytochrome c.
Therefore, it is possible that the increase in Apaf-1 expression seen after cisplatin and trichostatin A treatment in
A2780 cells is because of relocalization of Apaf-1 to the
cytoplasmic compartment. However, the finding that
cytoplasmic expression of Apaf-1 is not predictive of
apoptosome function in the chemoresistant cell lines
argues against the theory that ectopic (noncytosolic) localization of Apaf-1 may play a role in chemoresistance in
ovarian cancer. Although treatment with trichostatin A
resulted in increased Apaf-1 expression in ovarian carcinoma cell lines, this finding does not preclude the possibility that trichostatin A treatment also alters the function
of Apaf-1. Trichostatin A-induced growth inhibition and
cytotoxicity may be attributed to acetylation of both histone and nonhistone proteins. Thus, it is possible that trichostatin A treatment results in post-translational
modifications of apoptosome factors such as Apaf-1. Our
data suggest that trichostatin A treatment enhances the
ability of Apaf-1 to bind procaspase-9, independent of
increasing Apaf-1 expression levels. Furthermore, trichostatin A treatment results in increased caspase-9 activation
independent of its effects on Apaf-1 and/or caspase-9
expression. Preliminary experiments indicate that
recombinant human Apaf-1 is acetylated in an in vitro
acetylation assay using purified histone acetyltransferases,
CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (data not
shown). Experiments are currently underway to determine the functional significance of Apaf-1 acetylation in
vivo. Other groups have also shown that normal, untransformed cells have a strikingly reduced sensitivity to

HDAC inhibitor-induced cell death as compared with tumor cells.16 Differences in the acetylome in normal versus
tumor cells may account for differential response to
HDAC inhibitors, and Apaf-1 may play an important
role in modulating response to treatment.
HDAC inhibitors from multiple classes have clinical
activity in several tumor types.4 HDAC inhibitors can
increase the expression and/or activity of proteins that
directly transmit an apoptotic signal through death receptor pathways such as death receptors, death receptor
ligands, and downstream caspases (caspase-8 and caspase3), and can down-regulate proteins that negatively regulate death-receptor signaling (ie, c-FLIP, XIAP, survivin,
c-IAP1/2).17 The mechanisms through which HDAC
inhibitors activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway are not
entirely clear. There is some evidence that HDAC inhibitor treatment results in alterations in gene expression of
proapoptotic (BH3-only genes) and antiapoptotic (prosurvival Bcl-2 family genes) cells, favoring an overall apoptotic response.18 There is also some evidence that
HDAC inhibitors can mediate post-translational modification of proapoptotic proteins such as the cleavage and
activation of Bid, resulting in activation of the intrinsic
pathway.19 Our work represents the first report of HDAC
inhibitor activation of the intrinsic pathway by enhancing
Apaf-1 function.
Alterations in acetylation status can affect proteinprotein interactions among nonhistone substrates.
Although HDAC inhibitors likely have pleiotropic effects
on nonhistone substrates, it is possible that HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis may be associated with modulation
of acetylation status of apoptosome factors. Modulation
of Apaf-1 function using HDAC inhibitor may be an
effective means of overcoming chemoresistance in ovarian
cancer.
