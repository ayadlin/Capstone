BACKGROUND: The hypomethylating agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine are most commonly used to treat patients with
higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To the authors’ knowledge, the prognosis of patients with low-risk and intermediate-1–
risk MDS by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) after HMA failure has not been explored comprehensively. METHODS:
The clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of 438 patients with low-risk and intermediate-1–risk MDS who were treated with
HMAs were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Using the International Working Group response criteria, the overall objective
response to HMA was 35% with a median of 6 cycles of HMA administered, and the median response duration was 7 months. Only 7%
of patients had disease that transformed into acute myeloid leukemia while receiving therapy. Of the 290 patients who were evaluable at the time of HMA failure, 77% remained in the lower-risk disease categories. On multivariate analysis, baseline neutropenia,
intermediate-risk and poor-risk baseline karyotype, and lack of response to HMA were found to be independently associated with a
higher risk of disease progression. With a median follow-up of 16 months, the median transformation-free survival and overall survival
(OS) after HMA failure were 15 months and 17 months, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only The University of Texas MD Anderson Global Scoring System was found to be independently predictive of outcome, with patients with higher-risk categories having
poor transformation-free survival (hazards ratio [HR], 1.5; P 5.003) and OS (HR, 1.8; P 5.002). The administration of salvage therapy
was independently associated with better OS only (HR, 0.8; P 5.01). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of patients with lower-risk MDS after
HMA failure are poor and the treatment of these patients remains an unmet medical need. OS is a reasonable primary endpoint for

INTRODUCTION
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid disorders characterized by ineffective
hematopoiesis and an increased risk of transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).1 Patients with MDS are often divided by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) into lower-risk (low and intermediate-1) and higherrisk (intermediate-2-and high) subsets.2 The prognosis of patients with lower-risk MDS is heterogeneous, with survival
ranging from 14 to 80 months.3 Hypomethylating agents (HMAs; azacitidine and decitabine) are considered the standard
of care for patients with higher-risk MDS, although they also are commonly used in patients with lower-risk MDS (and
have regulatory approval for such use in the United States), particularly in those with neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, or in those for whom other agents (growth factors or lenalidomide) have failed.4-7 We and others have previously
reported on the outcome of patients with higher-risk disease after HMA failure. These patients have a poor prognosis,
with a median survival of 4 to 6 months.8-10 To our knowledge, the prognosis of patients with low-risk and intermediate-

Lower-Risk MDS Post Hypomethylating Failure/Jabbour et al

1–risk MDS after HMA failure has not been explored
comprehensively,11 despite the limited treatment options
available to such patients and implications for the design
of future clinical trials.
In the current study, we assessed the outcome of
patients with lower-risk MDS after HMA failure and
identified prognostic factors for disease progression and
survival in those who retained their lower-risk disease designation after HMA failure, and in those who progressed
to higher-risk MDS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed clinical characteristics, treatment details,
and outcomes of 438 consecutive patients with IPSS lowrisk (145 patients) and intermediate-1-risk (293 patients)
disease who were treated with and failed treatment with
HMAs at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC; 159 patients) and H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (279 patients) between 2000 and 2011. For
the purpose of the current study, patients were considered
evaluable if karyotype data were available at time of HMA
failure. The study was approved by the respective Institutional Review Boards.
Failure was defined as no response after at least 6
cycles of therapy, loss of response, progression to higherrisk MDS categories, transformation to AML, or discontinuation of therapy due to side effects. Patients who were
taken off therapy were analyzed for the reason for HMA
discontinuation, as well as for characteristics at the time of
HMA treatment and at the time HMA was discontinued.
All patients included in the current study were considered
to have failed HMA due to no response, lost response,
and/or progression to AML. Responses to HMA and subsequent therapies were coded according to the 2006 International Working Group Criteria for response assessment
in patients with MDS.12
Patients were categorized for MDS risk at the initiation of HMA therapy and at the time of failure of HMA
according to the IPSS,2 the revised IPSS (IPSS-R),13 the
MDACC Global Scoring System (MDGSS),14 and the
Low-Risk MD Anderson Scoring System (LRMDSS),15
the latter being applicable to patients with low-risk and
intermediate-1- risk disease according to the IPSS.
Survival probabilities were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, assessed from the time of HMA
failure, and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate
and multivariate analyses were performed to identify
potential prognostic factors associated with progression
into higher-risk MDS categories, transformation-free survival (TFS), and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analyCancer

RESULTS
Baseline Patient Characteristics

Baseline clinical characteristics at the initiation of HMA
therapy are summarized in Table 1. Overall, there were no
differences noted between the overall population and the
290 evaluable patients who had cytogenetic studies available at the time of HMA failure. Approximately one-third
of patients had low-risk disease by the IPSS and twothirds had intermediate-1–risk disease. The majority of
patients had favorable-risk baseline cytogenetics according
to the IPSS and were diagnosed with de novo MDS rather
than therapy-related disease. Greater than 75% of patients
were transfusion-dependent at the time HMA therapy,
with serum ferritin measurements of >1000 ng/mL
reported in approximately two-thirds of patients. Approximately two-thirds of patients had previously failed to
respond to growth factor therapies.
Response to HMA Therapy

The best response to HMA therapy and the reasons for
treatment failure are summarized in Table 2. The median
duration from diagnosis to HMA therapy was 7 months.
The best response to HMA therapy was complete
response in 10% of patients, a partial response in 4% of

patients, and hematologic improvement in 21% of
patients. The overall objective response was 36%.
Approximately one-half of the patients (54%) had stable
disease while receiving therapy, with no further improvement noted. The median number of HMA cycles administered was 6 (range, 1-64 cycles) and the median response
duration was 7 months (range, 1-73 months). The majority of patients discontinued therapy because of loss of
response (30%) or primary resistance (45%) as judged by
the treating physician. Twenty-six patients (6%) had disease that transformed into AML while receiving HMA
therapy, 13 patients (3%) withdrew from therapy because
of side effects, and 11 patients (3%) died while receiving
therapy. The remaining patients (13%) withdrew from

medical reasons), or were lost to follow-up.
It is interesting to note that there was no difference
in patient characteristics noted between patients treated
with azacitidine and those treated with decitabine, nor
was any difference observed with regard to response rates
between the 2 HMAs administered.
Patient Characteristics at the Time of HMA
Failure

Of the 290 patients who were evaluable at the time of
HMA failure, the majority (54% to 77%) continued to
have lower-risk disease as assessed by the IPSS, the IPSSR, or the MDGSS. Rates of evolution to higher-risk disease were 23% (high: 8%; intermediate-2: 15%) using the
IPSS, 30% (high: 20%; very high: 10%) using the IPSSR, and 46% (poor: 17%; intermediate-2: 29%) using the
MDGSS (Table 3). The MDGSS identified a larger group
of patients with higher-risk disease, some of whom were
classified as having lower-risk disease by the IPSS and
IPSS-R.
On multivariate analyses, factors associated with disease progression from lower-risk to higher-risk MDS categories among the 290 evaluable patients included baseline
neutropenia, intermediate-risk and poor-risk baseline
karyotype (according to the IPSS classification), and lack
of response to HMAs (Table 4).
Outcome After HMA Failure

A total of 89 patients (31%) were still alive at a median
follow-up of 16 months (range, 1-80 months) from HMA

failure. A total of 204 patients (70%) subsequently experienced a transformation to AML (93 patients) or died (111
patients). The median TFS and OS after HMA failure
was 15 months (range, 1-80 months) and 17 months
(range, 1-80 months), respectively (Fig. 1A). There was
no difference in outcome noted between the 290 evaluable
patients and the entire cohort of 438 patients (median survival, 15 months [range, 1-80 months] overall) (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, there was no difference noted in terms of
leukemia-free and OS after HMA failure between the 2
types of HMAs administered.
We assessed survival according to different scoring
systems applied at the time of HMA failure (Table 3). As
expected, patients with higher-risk disease at time of
HMA failure had a worse outcome. The median OS
ranged from <1 year for patients with higher-risk disease
to approximately 3 years in patients with lower-risk disease after HMA failure (Fig. 1C). Using the MDGSS at
the time of HMA failure, we were able to divide our population into 2 groups. The first group had lower-risk disease at the time of the initiation of treatment with HMAs
and higher-risk disease at the time of HMA failure
(approximately two-thirds of patients), with a median survival of 1 year. The second group had lower-risk disease at
the time of HMA initiation and at HMA failure, with a
median survival of approximately 3 years (Fig. 1D). Similarly, the median TFS ranged from 7 to 12 months in
patients with lower-risk disease to <3 years in patients
with higher-risk disease at the time of HMA failure (Fig.
1E). In addition, we identified 2 groups of patients with a
high risk and low risk of transformation, with a median
TFS of 11 months and 31 months, respectively (Fig. 1F).

(ASCT). Ninety-one patients (31%) received investigational
agents, 26 patients (9%) underwent ASCT, and 83 patients
(29%) received conventional or noninvestigational therapies,
mainly with cytarabine-based regimens or additional HMAs;
90 patients (31%) elected not to receive any further treatment beyond supportive care. Of the 91 patients receiving
cytarabine-based therapy, 16 (18%) responded. Of the 91
patients receiving investigational therapy, 15 (16%)
responded. Eighteen of the 26 patients who underwent
ASCT achieved a complete remission. The administration of
salvage therapy was associated with better survival. The median survival from HMA failure was 10 months, 28 months,
17 months, and 39 months, respectively, for patients not
receiving further therapy and for those treated with conventional agents, investigational agents, and ASCT (P 5 .001)
(Fig. 1G). Because patients not pursuing salvage therapy may
have had advanced disease and may not have been candidates
for further therapy, we performed a landmark analysis at 1
month and 2 months after HMA failure. The landmark analysis confirmed the superior outcome in patients receiving salvage therapy after HMA failure.
Prognostic Factors for Survival After HMA
Failure

Using univariate and multivariate analysis, we assessed
factors associated with survival at the time of HMA
failure. On univariate analysis, thrombocytopenia; bone
marrow blasts >5%; intermediate-risk and poor-risk
cytogenetics; higher-risk disease categories by the IPSS,
IPSS-R, MDGSS, and LRMDSS; lack of response to
880

HMA therapy; and lack of salvage treatment after HMA
failure were associated with worse outcome (Table 5). Previous therapy with erythropoietin-stimulating agents
(ESAs) did not appear to affect outcome after HMA failure on the univariate analysis and therefore it was not
included in the multivariate analyses for leukemia-free
survival and OS. On multivariate analyses, only the
MDGSS was found to be independently predictive of outcome, with patients with higher-risk MDS found to have
poor TFS (hazards ratio [HR], 1.5; P 5 .003) and OS
(HR, 1.8; P 5 .002). The administration of salvage therapy rather than only supportive care was found to be independently associated with better OS only (HR, 0.8;
P 5 .01) but not with a decrease in the rates of disease
progression.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
to present the outcome of a large series of patients with
low-risk and intermediate-1–risk MDS according to the
IPSS who were treated with HMAs and whose disease
failed to respond to an HMA or progressed after an initial
clinical response. The median OS of 16 months for these
patients confirmed their general poor outcome and the
urgent need for improved salvage therapies. This is in
keeping with a preliminary previous report from Prebet
et al, who reported a median survival of 17 months after
HMA failure in 59 patients with lower-risk disease.11
The results of our multivariate models demonstrated
that simple clinical and biologic characteristics, as well as
the initial response to HMA, can predict progression into
higher-risk disease categories (23%), and that the
MDGSS, applied at the time of HMA therapy failure, can
predict independently of any other parameters TFS and
OS, thus dividing patients into 2 categories of those with
low-risk and high-risk disease with approximate median
survivals of 3 years and 1 year, respectively. It is interesting
to note that the outcome of patients who remained in
lower-risk categories was similar to that of those with resistance to ESAs, in whom the median survival after ESA
failure was reported to be 40 months.19 Determining
which patients with lower-risk disease are in need of
HMA therapy is warranted. A randomized trial assessing
the impact of HMA in newly diagnosed patients with
lower-risk MDS is currently ongoing.
The MDGSS predicted survival in this large cohort
of patients with lower-risk disease, a finding that is similar
to our previous report of patients with high-risk disease after decitabine failure.8 This score includes poor performance, older age, thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased

bone marrow blasts, leukocytosis, chromosome 7 or complex (3) abnormalities, and prior transfusions. It allows
risk assessment of any patient, regardless of prior therapy,
at different time points in the course of the disease.14 In the
report by Prebet et al, age, bone marrow blast count, and
cytogenetics (all of which were included in our model) were
found to have prognostic value as well.9 In addition, and
similar to the recent report published by Prebet et al regarding the outcome of patients with lower-risk MDS after
HMA failure,11 the initial response to HMA was not found
to have an impact on survival after failure.
The results of the current analysis are important for
patient and physician decision-making, as well as to establish individual patient expectations and to assess the benefit of newer therapies. At the time of HMA failure, based
on the MDGSS, patients can be divided into low-risk and
high-risk groups with median survivals of 3 years and 1
year, respectively. This simple risk model could thus be
used to advise patients of their prognosis and treatment
options, and to evaluate the benefit of newer therapies after failure of HMA therapy. That being said and regardless of disease categorization at the time of HMA failure,
these patients continue to have a poor prognosis and
newer therapies are indicated. OS is a reasonable primary
endpoint for clinical studies targeting this population.
A variety of salvage regimens were administered to
patients in the current cohort. The outcome after any type
of treatment appeared better than supportive care as confirmed in our multivariate model, as well by performing a
landmark analysis at different time points after HMA failure. ASCT remained the option with the best outcome,
with long-term survival noted in a substantial percentage
of patients even if some patients underwent transplantation with progressive disease.20 This is in keeping with the
study by Prebet et al, in which the median survival of
patients who underwent ASCT was 19 months, which is
significantly superior to that of other treatments.9
In addition, we also observed an improved outcome
with investigational and standard treatments involving
cytarabine-based and HMA-based regimens. These findings are in keeping with previous results of patients with
high-risk disease after decitabine failure, in whom we
reported response rates between 15% to 30% with the use
of investigational agents and standard approaches.8,21
However, these data should be interpreted with caution
due to the inherent confounding factors of such an analysis such as performance status, accelerated disease, physician bias, etc. Dedicated studies for each type of treatment
will be necessary to refine the response rates and prognostic factors associated with each group of patients.

The results of the current study define the poor outcome in patients with lower-risk MDS after HMA failure
(median survival, 17 months). The treatment of these
patients remains an unmet medical need. We believe the
results presented herein will help in the design of future
clinical trials in this population, and indicate that OS is a
reasonable primary endpoint for such studies.
