ABSTRACT
Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) is a shunt product of glycolysis that
allosterically activates 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) resulting in increased
glucose uptake and glycolytic flux to lactate. The F2,6BP concentration is dictated by
four bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFB1-4)
with distinct kinase:phosphatase activities. PFKFB4 is over-expressed in human
cancers, induced by hypoxia and required for survival and growth of several cancer
cell lines. Although PFKFB4 appears to be a rational target for anti-neoplastic drug
development, it is not clear whether its kinase or phosphatase activity is required for
cancer cell survival. In this study, we demonstrate that recombinant human PFKFB4
kinase activity is 4.3-fold greater than its phosphatase activity, siRNA and genomic
deletion of PFKFB4 decrease F2,6BP, PFKFB4 over-expression increases F2,6BP and
selective PFKFB4 inhibition in vivo markedly reduces F2,6BP, glucose uptake and ATP.
Last, we find that PFKFB4 is required for cancer cell survival during the metabolic
response to hypoxia, presumably to enable glycolytic production of ATP when the
electron transport chain is not fully operational. Taken together, our data indicate
that the PFKFB4 expressed in multiple transformed cells and tumors functions to
synthesize F2,6BP. We predict that pharmacological disruption of the PFKFB4 kinase
domain may have clinical utility for the treatment of human cancers.

INTRODUCTION

glucose metabolism via PFK-1, understanding their
specific functions within cells and tissues is of paramount
importance to the study of a multitude of disease states
caused by inflammation, ischemia and neoplastic
transformation.
Within five years of the initial discovery of F2,6BP
in 1980 [3, 4], multiple PFKFB enzyme activities were
detected in several organs that were distinguished by
having markedly reduced but still detectable fructose2,6-bisphosphatase activities relative to the liver PFKFB1
family member which has a near 1:1 kinase:bisphosphatase
ratio (1). Interestingly, a distinct PFKFB activity was
detected in the testes [5] and a human testes-specific

Glucose metabolism is regulated by a family of
four bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/ fructose2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFB1-4) that determine the
concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP),
which is a potent allosteric activator of the glycolytic
enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) [1]. Whereas
F2,6BP activates PFK-1, several metabolic products
including ATP, H+ ions and citrate, allosterically inhibit
PFK-1, indicating that PFK-1 is an essential metabolic
sensor in the glycolytic pathway [2]. Given the central
role that the PFKFB family members play in regulating

PFKFB4 gene then was cloned in 1999 [6] suggesting
that the unique metabolic requirements of sperm may
necessitate a divergent PFKFB family member. Although
several reports indicated that the testes PFKFB4 from
various species display approximately 3-5 fold higher
kinase than phosphatase activity [5, 7, 8], suggesting that
its function was predominantly to increase glycolytic flux
into the 3-carbon portion of the pathway, one study of
purified protein reported a near 1:1 ratio similar to that of
the liver PFKFB1 family member [9].
In the early 2000s, Minchenko et al. demonstrated
that the testes PFKFB4 was induced by hypoxia in
multiple cancer cell lines and over-expressed in matched
human lung, breast and colon tumor tissues relative
to normal tissues from the same patients [10-13]. The
functional requirement of PFKFB4 for tumor growth then
was published in 2010 when researchers demonstrated that
selective inhibition of PFKFB4 with siRNA suppressed
the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts in
athymic mice (U.S. Patent #8,283,332; PFKFB4 Inhibitors
and Methods of Using the Same). The importance of
PFKFB4 as a potential target for the development of
cancer therapeutics was then significantly expanded in
2012 by two independent groups that conducted unbiased
screens for genes essential for cancer survival and found
that PFKFB4 is required for both glioma stem-like
cell [14] and prostate cancer cell survival [15] but not
for normal cell survival. Taken together, these studies
indicated that PFKFB4 may be a useful molecular target
for the development of anti-neoplastic agents.
An essential first step in developing anti-cancer
agents that inhibit PFKFB4 is to determine whether the
kinase or phosphatase domain of this bifunctional enzyme
are active in neoplastic cells. Whereas the kinase activity
will produce F2,6BP and increase flux down the glycolytic
pathway producing ATP, the phosphatase activity will
decrease F2,6BP, reduce PFK-1 activity and increase
the oxidative pentose shunt activity and NADPH via the
availability of glucose 6-phosphate which is in equilibrium
with fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) through glucose
6-phosphate isomerase. Given that the intracellular
concentration of the substrate of the kinase domain (F6P)
is >10,000 fold the substrate of the phosphatase domain
(F2,6BP) in transformed cells (e.g. MCF-7 cells: F6P,
50±24 nmol/mg protein [16]; F2,6BP, 2.97±.21 pmol/
mg protein [17]), we predicted that the kinase activity of
PFKFB4 would be the dominant function of this enzyme
in transformed cells.
In the present study, we find that PFKFB4 functions
primarily to produce F2,6BP, thus stimulating glycolytic
flux to lactate and the Kreb’s cycle in order to generate
ATP and anabolic precursors. Accordingly, the synthesis of
small molecule inhibitors of the PFKFB4 kinase domain is
anticipated to enable the development of novel agents for
the treatment of cancer.

High Expression of PFKFB4 in Several Normal
Tissues and in Lung Adenocarcinomas
We first conducted a simultaneous analysis of
PFKFB1-4 mRNA expression in normal human tissues
using real-time RT-PCR for each family member. We
observed high expression of: PFKFB1 in liver and skeletal
muscle; PFKFB2 in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney,
pancreas and testes; and PFKFB4 in placenta, lung,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, spleen, prostate, testes, ovary,
colon and leukocytes (Fig. 1A). PFKFB3, which has been
characterized as being inducible [18] and ubiquitous [19],
was expressed at very low levels in all tissues with the
exception of leukocytes (Fig 1A). We then used multiplex
RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR to assess PFKFB1-4
mRNA expression in normal lung tissues and adjacent
lung adenocarcinomas from five patients. Only PFKFB4
mRNA was over-expressed in each of these patients’
tumors (Fig. 1B, C). Further examination of a larger cohort
of lung adenocarcinomas and adjacent normal tissues from
18 patients by immunohistochemical analyses revealed
high PFKFB4 protein expression relative to normal lung
alveoli (Fig. 1D, E).

The Kinase:Phosphatase Ratio of PFKFB4 is 4.3:1
and Selective Inhibition of PFKFB4 Expression
Reduces F2,6BP in Multiple Cancer Cell Lines
We expressed and purified recombinant human
PFKFB4 and compared the kinase and phosphatase
activities to those of the inducible PFKFB3 recombinant
protein. Given the recent reports that PFKFB4 functions
as a dominant bisphosphatase in cancer cells [15], we
were surprised to find that recombinant human PFKFB4
had significant kinase activity that was ~15% that of
the PFKFB3 family member whose kinase domain
has previously been established to set the intracellular
concentration of F2,6BP in multiple cell lines (PFKFB4
kinase Vmax = 5.06±0.2 mU/mg, PFKFB3 kinase Vmax=
38.4 ±2.3 mU/mg) (Fig. 2A) [18, 20, 21]. In contrast,
both PFKFB4 and PFKFB3 were found to have relatively
low phosphatase activities (PFKFB4 bisphosphatase
Vmax = 1.17±0.02 mU/mg; PFKFB3 bisphosphatase Vmax
= 0.47±0.035 mU/mg) and the kinase:bisphosphatase
ratios for PFKFB4 and PFKFB3 were calculated to
be 4.3:1 and 81.7:1, respectively (Fig. 2A). Since the
concentration of the kinase substrate, F6P, is so much
higher than that of the bisphosphatase substrate, F2,6BP
(e.g. H460 cell [F6P] = 12518±1104 pmol/mg protein;
[F2,6BP] = 4.47±.21 pmol/mg protein) and because the
kinase:phosphatase is 4.3:1, we predicted that selective
inhibition of PFKFB4 would preferentially inhibit the

kinase function of this bifunctional enzyme and thus
result in a reduction in F2,6BP. We found that this did
indeed occur in six out of seven transformed cancer cell
lines derived from lung, colon, prostate and breast that
were each transfected with two separate PFKFB4-specific
siRNAs (Fig. 2B). Importantly, genomic deletion of Pfkfb4
in LT-immortalized fibroblasts also caused a marked
reduction in F2,6BP (Fig. 2C). Since PFKFB3, unlike
PFKFB4, has been established to function as a kinase in
transformed cells, we next examined the effect of PFKFB3
siRNA transfection on three transformed cell lines and
similarly observed a marked reduction in the steady-state
concentration of F2,6BP (Fig. 2D).

We examined the effect of the two PFKFB4 siRNA
molecules and genomic deletion of Pfkfb4 on glycolysis
(measured by the production of 3H2O from [5-3H]glucose),
ATP and NADPH. We predicted that if the kinase function
of PFKFB4 is dominant, then PFKFB4 inhibition would
suppress (rather than increase) glycolysis and decrease
the concentration of ATP which is produced downstream
of PFK-1. We found that both glycolysis and ATP were
reduced in all five cell lines examined although the ATP

depletion in MCF-7 cells was not statistically significant
(Fig. 3A). Although we observed variable effects on
NADPH, we did find that PFKFB4 inhibition increased
NADPH in H460, A549, LNCaP and MCF-7 cells,
presumably as a result of increased availability of F6P
for the activity of glucose 6-phosphate isomerase and the
oxidative pentose shunt (Fig. 3A). Importantly, we found
that Pfkfb4 genomic deletion reduced glycolysis and ATP
and increased NADPH, all findings consistent with a
requirement of PFKFB4 for the activation of PFK-1 (Fig.
3B).

transfection and genomic deletion both reduced F2,6BP,
we predicted that over-expression would have the
opposite effect on F2,6BP and subsequent metabolic
events. We found that PFKFB4 over-expression increased
F2,6BP, glycolysis and ATP, and decreased NADPH in
each of the examined transformed cell lines (Fig. 4). We
also examined the effect of addition of 5 mM pyruvate
on the depletion of ATP caused by PFKFB4 siRNA in
H460 cells and found that pyruvate partially reversed the
ATP depletion, further supporting a role for PFKFB4 in
increasing the glycolytic production of ATP (ATP, pmoles/
µg protein: Ctrl siRNA, 39.9±0.2; PFKFB4 siRNA
9.94±0.5; Ctrl siRNA + Pyruvate, 40.4±0.13; PFKFB4

caspase 3 (Fig 5C, D, F) We also found a small increase
in NADPH in the PFKFB4 shRNA tumors in comparison
with control tumors which was not statistically significant
(Fig 5E). In addition, we examined uptake of [18F]-FDG
in PFKFB4 shRNA and control tumors by PET scan and
observed reduced tumor [18F]-FDG uptake in the PFKFB4
shRNA tumors (Fig. 5G) as has also been described as a
result of PFKFB3 inhibition. Taken together, these in vivo
studies provide strong evidence that PFKFB4 supports
tumor growth by functioning as a kinase to synthesize
F2,6BP.

In order to determine if PFKFB4 functions to
synthesize F2,6BP in vivo, we stably transfected H460
cells with PFKFB4 shRNA and confirmed reduced
PFKFB4 protein expression in vitro (Fig 5A). We found
that stable PFKFB4 inhibition reduced anchorageindependent growth as soft agar colonies and as tumors
(Fig. 5A, B). We then examined resected tumors after
two weeks of growth and observed a marked reduction
in tumor F2,6BP and ATP and an increase in apoptotic

under 21% and 1% oxygen. We observed a reduction in
the hypoxic induction of both enzyme mRNAs as a result
of the siRNA molecules (Fig. 6A). Hypoxia strongly
induced PFKFB4 protein expression, as has been observed
in other cell lines (Fig. 6A-C). Interestingly, we found a far
lower induction of PFKFB3 protein which may already be
maximally expressed as a result of the multitude of genetic
alterations that increase PFKFB3 protein expression such
as PTEN loss and Ras activation (e.g. H460 cells express
KRASQ61H) [20, 25, 26]. Importantly, transfection with
either PFKFB4 or PFKFB3 siRNA caused an attenuation

PFKFB4 may be essential for the glycolytic response to

we found that both PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 siRNAs caused
a reduction in the conversion of 13C-glucose to lactate
and glutamate as assessed by NMR, the PFKFB4 siRNA
caused a far greater reduction in the conversion to both
products under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions
(Fig. 7A, B).

Maintenance of intracellular ATP is required

knockdown. Values on the right denote ratios of peak areas normalized to uridine ribose (Urib) H1’, which correspond to relative amounts

active in transformed cells. Using multiple cell types
and approaches, we found that: (i) recombinant human
PFKFB4 has far more kinase activity than phosphatase
activity (kinase:phosphatase ratio = 4.3:1); (ii) selective
inhibition of PFKFB4 using two unique siRNA molecules
reduces the intracellular F2,6BP in six of seven cancer
cell lines indicating that endogenous PFKFB4 synthesizes
F2,6BP in these cancer cells; (iii) over-expression of
PFKFB4 increases the F2,6BP in all examined cancer
cell lines; and (iv) genomic deletion of the Pfkfb4 gene
reduces F2,6BP in LT-immortalized fibroblasts. Taken
together, these in vitro data provide overwhelming
evidence that the main biochemical function of PFKFB4 is
to synthesize F2,6BP. We also found that PFKFB4 siRNA
reduces glycolysis and ATP and increases the steady-state
concentration of NADPH in vitro, all expected metabolic
effects of reduced F2,6BP. Additionally, we observed that
PFKFB4 shRNA suppressed the glucose uptake, F2,6BP,

ATP and growth of H460 xenograft tumors in mice,
thus providing further evidence that the main function
of PFKFB4 in vivo is to synthesize F2,6BP and thus
activate PFK-1 and glycolysis. The rescue of transformed
cells from PFKFB4 inhibition with the addition of
pyruvate, which provides substrate for mitochondrial
ATP production, provides further support that PFKFB4 is
predominantly functioning to stimulate ATP production.
To summarize, these data indicate that the kinase activity
and, thus, the capacity to produce F2,6BP, serves as the
dominant function of PFKFB4 in cancer cells.
Since the majority of human cancers display
elevated glucose uptake and several targeted agents
such as the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, and the
estrogen antagonist, fulvestrant, acutely suppress glucose
metabolism in order to inhibit tumor growth [17, 27], we
believe that PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 kinase inhibitors may
prove effective for the treatment of cancer. Importantly,

a novel family of related small molecule antagonists of
the kinase domain of PFKFB3 (i.e. 3PO, PFK15 and
PFK158) have been found to reduce glycolytic flux, ATP
and cancer cell viability [17, 21, 28]. PFK158 is now
being tested in a phase I clinical trial of advanced cancer
patients (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT02044861) and recently
has been found to synergistically interact with targeted
cancer agents [17]. Given that PFKFB3 and PFKFB4
are co-expressed in several cancer cell lines and have the
redundant function of synthesizing F2,6BP, we postulate
that selective inhibition of a single family member may
result in compensation by a co-expressed PFKFB family
member, and that combinations of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4
inhibitors may be necessary in order to fully suppress
tumor glucose metabolism and growth. Future studies will
be directed at creating double Pfkfb3 and Pfkfb4 knockout
mice in order to conduct in vivo studies of the roles of
these two seemingly redundant enzymes in regulating the
glucose metabolism and growth of tumors.
Although this is the first comprehensive analysis of
the relative importance of the kinase activity of PFKFB4
in transformed cells to include a measurement of human
recombinant protein activity and a combination of siRNA
knock-down, plasmid-based over-expression and genomic
deletion experiments in multiple cancer cell types, two
prior studies previously have supported the conclusion
that the kinase domain of PFKFB4 was essential for
cancer cell proliferation. A PFKFB4 siRNA was found
to reduce F2,6BP and glycolytic flux to lactate in A549
lung adenocarcinoma cells (U.S. Patent #8,283,332) and
two other PFKFB4 siRNAs were independently observed
to reduce lactate secretion and the intracellular ATP in
malignant glioma cells [14]. However, a third study found
that PFKFB4 siRNA increased the F2,6BP concentration
of three prostate cancer cell lines [15] including the
LNCaP and PC3 cell lines (using one of the two siRNAs
examined in the current study). Although it is difficult to
reconcile the findings from this single discordant report
with those of the other two studies as well as the present
study, we believe that the combined use of recombinant
protein analyses, cell lines derived from several types
of cancer, two methods to inhibit PFKFB4 (siRNA
and genomic deletion) and PFKFB4 over-expression
experiments provide comprehensive and compelling data
demonstrating that the kinase activity of PFKFB4 dictates
the F2,6BP concentration in transformed cells. Whereas
we look forward to continued independent examinations
of the biochemical functions of PFKFB4 in transformed
cells, our current data support an essential role of the
PFKFB4 kinase activity for cancer cell survival as well as
the development of small molecule antagonists that target
the kinase domain of PFKFB4.
Although the differences in metabolic functions of
PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 are poorly understood, we observed
a more robust induction of PFKFB4 protein relative upon
exposure of H460 cells to 1% oxygen and significant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

correlation between hypoxia and PFKFB4 expression in
lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Additionally, we detected
a greater reduction in glycolytic flux to glutamate and
lactate caused by PFKFB4 siRNA relative to PFKFB3
siRNA transfection. Given these results, we suspect that
PFKFB4 may serve as a unique regulator of the glycolytic
response to hypoxia. This hypothesis is supported by
the observation that the H460 cells underwent increased
hypoxia-associated apoptosis when subjected to PFKFB4
siRNA transfection but not when subjected to PFKFB3
siRNA transfection. These data suggest that tumors that
are especially affected by poor vasculature and hypoxia
may be most responsive to PFKFB4 inhibition.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our data indicate that the PFKFB4
family member functions predominantly to synthesize
F2,6BP which, in turn, is required for glycolytic flux
through PFK-1 and subsequent ATP production. This
conclusion is consistent with the finding that H460 cells
are exquisitely sensitive to PFKFB4 inhibition under
hypoxic conditions when the efficiency of ATP production
by the mitochondria is compromised and the reliance
on glycolysis to produce ATP is greatest. With the key
intramolecular target of PFKFB4 now established, we
believe that PFKFB4 inhibitors can be rationally designed
and that these agents may prove most useful when
combined with PFKFB3 inhibitors in order to circumvent
potential compensation between these two PFKFB family
members.

METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
A549 and H460 NSCLC, MCF7 breast
adenocarcinoma, LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 prostatic
adenocarcinoma and HCT116 colon adenocarcinoma
cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
PFKFB4-/- ear pinna fibroblasts were isolated from
TamCre/loxP/PFKFB4-/- mice and immortalized by
transduction with REBNA/IRES retrovirus expressing
SV40 large T antigen as described previously [20].
Cell lines were grown in DMEM (A549, LNCaP, PC3,
DU145 and PFKFB4-/-), RPMI 1640 (H460), McCoy’s 5A
media (HCT116) or improved MEM (MCF7) (all from
Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS, Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37ºC in 5% CO2.
In some experiments, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT, 4HT,
Sigma -Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to PFKFB4
-/fibroblasts at indicated concentrations.

numbers were calculated. Statistical significance was
assessed by the two-sample t test (independent variable).

For siRNA experiments, cells growing in 6-well
plates were transfected with control siRNA (Stealth
Negative Control Medium GC Duplex, Invitrogen),
PFKFB3 siRNA (FB3; HSS107860, Invitrogen) or
PFKFB4 siRNA (FB41, FB4; HSS107863, Invitrogen and
FB42; siGENOME human PFKFB4 5210 #2, Dharmacon)
using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), and harvested 48 hours after transfection. For
hypoxia experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA
and, after 24 hours, were placed in a hypoxia chamber
(Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA) purged with 1%
oxygen for 24 hours. For short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
experiments, sense and antisense DNA oligonucleotides
for PFKFB4 were designed with a hairpin against
the target sequences 5’-cacttgtatggtcctgt-3’ and
5’-ggagagcgaccatcttt-3’ were produced by IDT (Coralville,
IA). The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into
pSUPER.neo vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) following
manufacturer’s instructions. H460 cells were transfected
with an shRNA-expressing plasmid targeted against
PFKFB4 (shFB4) or a scrambled shRNA expressing
plasmid (Control) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and clones selected with G418 (500 µg/ml).
For overexpression experiments, cells were transfected
with pCMV-XL4 (vector) or pCMV-XL4 containing
full-length PFKFB4 (Origene, Rockville, MD) using
Lipofectamine 2000 and harvested after 48 hours.

Protein extraction and Western blotting
Cells were harvested, washed X1 in PBS and lysed
in 1X lysis buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL)
containing protease inhibitors. Protein samples were
resolved on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (BioRad, Hercules,
CA) and transferred to PVDF membranes (BioRad). After
blocking in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and
5% milk, membranes were probed with antibodies to
PFKFB3 (Proteintech, Chicago, IL), PFKFB4 (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) or β-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
Secondary antibodies used were HRP-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (1:5000, Pierce Biotechnology).
Scanned images were quantified by densitometric analyses
using Image J software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Values
obtained were normalized to β-actin and expressed
in densitometric units as a percentage of control. The
data represented are the mean ± SD from triplicate
measurements from three independent experiments.
Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t
test (independent variable).

Kinase and Bisphosphatase assays
Fructose-6-phosphate kinase and fructose-2,6bisphosphatase activities of human recombinant PFKFB3
and PFKFB4 were assayed using previously described
methods wherein one unit of activity was defined as the
amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 µmol
of F2,6BP per min. [7, 8]. Aliquots of the reaction mixture
were removed at intervals, added to 0.1N NaOH and then
neutralized to a pH of 7.2 and assayed for F2,6BP as
described below.

PCR analyses
Multiplex mRNA primers were custom synthesized
(IDT) against human PFKFB1-4 as described previously
[20]. cDNA from normal human tissues and matched
tumor and adjacent normal tissues (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA) were analyzed using these primers and standard
PCR conditions. PFKFB1-4 mRNA expression was
determined using real-time RT-PCR with TaqMan probes
for human PFKFB1-4 and β-actin (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) in triplicate in 96-well optical plates
(MicroAMP®, Applied Biosystems). Analysis of
results and fold differences between samples were
determined using StepOne software (version2.1) (Applied
Biosystems) and calculated from the ΔΔCT values with
the formula (2-ΔΔCT). The data are represented as the mean
± SD from triplicate measurements from three independent
experiments. For calculation of copy number, the
molecular weight was determined for the double stranded
DNA sequences of the 4 PFKFB isoforms. The OD of the
DNA (in gm/μL) was divided by the molecular weight of
the product (result in moles/μL) and then this number was
multiplied by Avogadro’s number (6.022 × 1023 molecules/
mole). The resulting number of DNA molecules per μL
was used to generate a standard curve from which copy

F2,6BP measurements
Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, lysed
in NaOH/Tris acetate by heating at 80°C for 5 min. Lysates
were neutralized to pH 7.2 with ice-cold acetic acid and
HEPES. F2,6BP content was measured using a coupled
enzyme reaction following the method of Van Schaftingen
et al [29]. The F2,6BP concentration was normalized to
total cellular protein measured by the bicinchoninic acid
assay (BCA, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). All data
are expressed as the mean ± SD of three experiments.
Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t
test (independent variable).

concentrations of the lysates were estimated using
the BCA assay and ATP was expressed as pmol per µg
protein. All data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three
experiments. Statistical significance was assessed by the
two-sample t test (independent variable).

Cells growing in 6-well plates were incubated in
500 μl of complete medium containing 1 μCi of 5-[3H]
glucose per well for 60 min in 5% CO2 at 37°C. The
medium was then collected and centrifuged for 5 min at
8000 rpm to pellet any suspended cells. To separate the
3
H2O formed via glycolysis from the 5-[3H]glucose added
to the medium, an evaporation technique in a sealed
system was utilized. Briefly, 150 μl aliquots of medium
were added to open tubes that were placed upright inside
scintillation vials containing 1 ml of H2O. The scintillation
vials were sealed, and the 3H2O produced by glycolysis
through enolase and released to the medium was allowed
to equilibrate with the H2O in the outer vial for 48 h at
37°C. The amounts of 3H2O that had diffused into the
surrounding H2O was measured on a Tri-Carb 2910 liquid
scintillation analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) and
compared with 3H2O and 5-[3H]glucose standards. Protein
concentration was determined using the BCA assay and
counts were normalized to protein concentration. All data
are expressed as the mean ± SD of three experiments.
Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t
test (independent variable).

NADPH Measurements
Cells were harvested, washed with ice cold
PBS and homogenized in NADPH extraction buffer
(EnzyFluo, Bioassay Systems, Hayward, CA). NADPH
was then measured following manufacturer’s instructions
(Bioassay Systems) by reduction of the provided probe
into a fluorescent product measured at λex/em of 530/585
nm. Values were compared with a standard curve. All data
are expressed as the mean ± SD of three experiments.
Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t
test (independent variable).

Apoptosis Assay
Cells were stained with FITC-labeled annexin-V and
propidium iodide following the manufacturer’s protocol
(BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Briefly, cells were
detached and 100,000 cells per sample were pelleted by
centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and washed X1
with PBS. The cells were then resuspended in 1X binding
buffer, annexin-V/FITC and/or propidium iodide added
and were incubated in the dark at room temperature for
15 minutes. 1X binding buffer was added to increase
volume and 10,000 events were counted for each sample
using the appropriate filters for FITC and PI detection
(BD FACSCalibur, San Jose, CA). Data was analyzed
using FlowJo software (TREE STAR Inc, San Carlos,
CA). Results were calculated as the average of triplicate
samples ± SD.

2-[1-14C]-Deoxy-D-Glucose Uptake
Cells were placed in glucose-free media for 30
minutes, 2-[1-14C]-deoxy-D-glucose (0.25 μCi/mL;
Perkin Elmer) was added for an additional 60 min and
the cells then were washed thrice with ice-cold glucosefree media. Cell lysates were collected in 500 μL of
0.1% SDS, and scintillation counts (counts/min) were
measured on 400 μL of the lysate. Counts were normalized
to protein concentration measured by the BCA assay
and data are represented as mean ± SD from triplicate
measurements from three independent experiments.
Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t
test (independent variable).

NMR Experiments
Cells treated with siRNA were grown in media
containing uniformly labeled 13C-glucose (2 gm/L,
Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories, Andover, MA) for 24
hours. Media samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Cells were counted and equal numbers of cells were
pelleted, washed twice with cold PBS to remove adhering
medium, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cell
pellets and media samples were extracted with 10% icecold trichloracetic acid (TCA) followed by lyophilization.
The extracts were redissolved in D2O containing 85
µM (media) or 95 µM (cells) DSS (2, 2-dimethyl-2silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt) as both a chemical
shift reference and as a concentration standard and loaded
into 5 mm Shigemi tubes (Shigemi, Tokyo, Japan).
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded

ATP Measurements
Cell pellets were lysed using Passive Lysis buffer
(1X, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Lysates were flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed (to 37ºC) once to
accomplish complete lysis and then centrifuged at 4ºC
for 30 seconds to clear the lysates. Intracellular ATP
levels were determined using a bioluminescence assay
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) utilizing recombinant
firefly luciferase and its substrate, d-luciferin and
following manufacturer’s instructions. The luminescence
was read in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs,
Sunnyvale, CA) at 560 nm. The ATP values were
calculated using an ATP standard curve. The protein

at 14.1 T on a Varian Inova spectrometer at 20°C using
a 90° excitation pulse as described previously [30]. 1D
proton NMR spectra of extracts were recorded with a 2
sec acquisition time and a total recycle time of 5 sec, with
presaturation of the residual HOD resonance for 3 seconds.
For analyzing the cellular extracts and determining the
positional enrichment with 13C we used 2D experiments
(TOCSY and 1H{13C}-HSQC), and quantified the 13C
satellite and 12C peaks by volume integration in the
TOCSY using established assignment protocols [30, 31].
The NMR experiments were carried out in the Structural
Biology Program’s NMR Core at the University of
Louisville James Graham Brown Cancer Center.

then incubated with primary antibody against PFKFB3,
PFKFB4, carbonic anhydrase IX (Proteintech) or cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) overnight,
followed by an HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (1:300, Pierce Biotechnology). The sections were
developed with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(DAB, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 min,
nuclei counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (SigmaAldrich) for 2 min and coverslips attached with Permount
(Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). Slides were scanned
using a ScanScope XT Digital Slide Scanner (Aperio),
data analyzed with the positive pixel count algorithm
(ImageScope, Aperio) and a minimum of 5 fields (20x
magnification) were quantified for each tumor section.
The data is depicted as % positive pixels/total pixels ± SD.

Mouse Studies

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

H460 cells stably transfected with either PFKFB4
or control shRNA were collected from exponential growth
phase culture. Cells were washed twice, re-suspended in
PBS (5 × 107 cells/ml) and groups of 10 BALB/c athymic
female mice were injected s.c. with 100 µL (5 × 106 cells)
of the cell suspension. The tumors were followed from
the time of appearance until the end of the experiment.
Tumor masses were determined in a blinded fashion
with Vernier calipers according to the following formula:
weight (mg) = (width, mm)2 × (length, mm)/2 [32]. All
data are expressed as the mean ± SD of two experiments.
Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sample t
test (independent variable). At the end of the experiment,
the animals were euthanized and tumors removed and
fixed in 10% formaldehyde. Sections were stained with
hematoxylin/eosin and for immunohistochemistry as
described below. At the end of the experiment, subsets
of xenograft-bearing mice (n=4) were injected i.p. with
2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG, 150µCi, 100
µL in H2O) and, after 45 min, were anesthetized with
2% isoflurane in oxygen and transferred to a R-4 Rodent
Scanner (CTI Concorde Microsystems) micro-positron
emission tomograph to capture images. Regions of
interest in the tumors and cerebellum were quantified in
quadruplicate and are expressed as the mean ± SD of the
ratio of tumor:cerebellar FDG uptake. Animal experiments
were carried out in accordance with established practices
as described in the National Institutes of Health Guide for
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved
by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
