Abstract
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) have been shown to
affect tumorigenesis in a variety of tumors. Quantitative PCR
analysis revealed down-regulation of BMP2 and BMP5 in
tissue samples from adrenocortical carcinoma and adrenocortical tumor cell lines compared with normal adrenal
glands. Integrity of BMP-dependent pathways in these cell
lines could be shown by activation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway
with subsequent increase of ID protein expression upon
incubation with BMP2 or BMP5. On a functional level, BMP
treatment resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and
viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This growth
inhibitory effect was associated with BMP-dependent reduction of AKT phosphorylation under baseline conditions and
under insulin-like growth factor costimulation. Furthermore,
steroidogenic function, including melanocortin-2 receptor
and steroidogenic enzyme expressions, was profoundly reduced. In vitro demethylation treatment and overexpression
of GATA6 resulted in reactivation of BMP-dependent pathways
with concomitant modulation of steroidogenesis. Taken
together, we show that loss of expression of members of the
BMP family of ligands is a common finding in adrenocortical
tumors and we provide evidence that BMP-dependent
pathways are likely to be involved in the modulation of the
malignant and functional phenotype of adrenocortical cancer
cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5784–92]

Introduction
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) are rare tumors with an
estimated prevalence between 4 and 12 per million and an overall
poor prognosis that has not significantly improved over the last
decades (1). Surgery remains the mainstay for tumor treatment
with a curative approach in patients with early diagnosis. Advance
tumor stages, however, are commonly identified during initial
diagnostic work-up, which require systemic treatment modalities.
Medical therapy is limited to common cytotoxic agents, which are
usually given in combination with the adrenolytic substance
mitotane (o,p’-DDD). Unfortunately, these treatment protocols are
associated with substantial toxic side effects (2). As for many other

tumor entities, specific molecular targeting with kinase inhibitors
or monoclonal antibodies holds the promise of therapies with
favorable efficacy and tolerability also for patients with adrenocortical cancer (3, 4). Nevertheless, these strategies require detailed
knowledge of molecular pathways involved in adrenocortical
tumorigenesis, which are only partially available to date (5).
Various growth factors and cytokines, including insulin-like
growth factor (IGF), transforming growth factor-a, transforming
growth factor-h (TGF-h), vascular endothelial growth factor, and
interleukins, have been shown to regulate cellular growth and
function of normal adult and fetal adrenals (6). Similarly, the
presence of a functional bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
pathway in adrenocortical cells has been previously reported and
involvement of BMP6 on mineralocorticoid secretion has been
proposed (7, 8). BMPs, which belong to the TGF-h superfamily,
have been originally identified by their capacity to induce
endochondral bone formation (9) but have since been recognized
to play a much more widespread role, particularly in the regulation
of cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation (reviewed in ref. 10).
In addition, in a number of cancer entities, BMPs have been shown
to act as autocrine or paracrine modifiers of tumor growth and
function (11).
BMPs signal through serine/threonine kinase receptors, which
are composed of type I and type II subtypes. Upon ligand binding,
signal transduction by phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad
proteins is initiated, which in turn heterodimerize with the
common partner Smad-4 and translocate into the nucleus. This
complex binds to specific DNA sequences and activates or represses
BMP target genes, e.g., ID (inhibitor of DNA binding proteins),
depending on the recruitment of further cofactors. BMPs are under
tight regulation through proteins with antagonistic properties
including extracellular noggin and follistatin and intracellular
inhibitory Smads, among others (reviewed in refs. 10, 12).
In the current study, we aimed to assess the potential role of
BMPs on adrenocortical tumorigenesis. We therefore determined
the expression of various BMPs and their receptors in human ACC
and performed in vitro studies to define the functional relevance of
the observed alterations of in vivo expression profiles. Altogether,
we show that both BMP2 and BMP5 inhibit proliferation and
modulate steroidogenesis of human adrenocortical tumor cells
in vitro. These functional findings, which can be modified by
pharmacologic demethylation and overexpression of GATA6, might,
thus, present a potential important regulator of ACC biology.

Influence of BMP2 and BMP5 on Adrenal Tumorigenesis

Figure 1. Expression analysis of members of the BMP pathway in ACC and adrenocortical tumor cell lines (SW13 and NCIh295) reveal lower expression of BMP2 and
BMP5 and reduced but retained BMPR expression (A ) compared with NAG. Accordingly, BMP5 and pSMAD1/5/8 immunoreactivity is significantly lower in ACC
samples compared with NAG (B). Treatment of adrenocortical tumor cells with BMP2 or BMP5 shows integrity of BMP-dependent pathways by phosphorylation of
SMAD 1/5/8 (immunoblots, C ) and up-regulation of ID1 and ID3 expression in a dose-dependent manner (D ). NCIh295 cells and primary adrenocortical tumor cells
(D, right ) were precultured and treated with either rhBMP2, BMP5 alone, or in combination with the antagonist noggin (C, right ), respectively. Values for qPCR
were normalized by h-actin levels. Inserts in immunohistochemical images display negative staining controls. Bars, 50 Am.

patients gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the
local ethical committee of the University Clinic Freiburg and Munich. For
RNA analysis, tissues were immediately frozen after surgery and kept at
80jC until further handling. Primary cell culture was performed as
described earlier (13).
Cell culture. ACC cell lines NCIh295 (European Collection of Cell
Cultures) and SW13 were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies),
containing 2.5% NuSerum IV (BD Bioscience) plus supplements (14). Before
treating the cells with recombinant human BMP2/5 or noggin (R&D Systems),
cells were precultured in DMEM/F12, containing 0.3% NuSerum (Low
NuSerum), prestarved in serum-free medium (SFM) for proliferation studies
or cultured in 2.0% UltroserG medium (Pall) for aldosterone measurements.

RNA extraction and quantitative PCR analysis. RNA was extracted,
purified with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion), and cDNA generated as
described earlier (15). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) amplifications
were performed using SYBRGreen technique (15) with the following primers:
BMP2 and BMPR 1a/1b/II (16); BMP4/5/6 (7); 3hHSD_F: CTAAGTTACGCCCTCTTCTG, 3hHSD_R: AATGTCTCCTTCAAGTACAGT, product:

hactin_R: CCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATG. 286 bp, T A: 56jC). For
ID1 and ID3 detection, QuantiTectPrimer Assays and QuantiTect SYBR
Green Mix were purchased from Qiagen and quantified according to the
manual (Qiagen).
Morphologic examination and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded tissues was performed, as described
earlier (15). For antigen retrieval, slides were boiled in 10 mmol/L sodium
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated with the following primary antibodies:
BMP5 (1:100, Lifespan Biosciences) and pSMAD1/5/8 (1:80, Cell Signaling
Technology). Morphologic analysis was performed with a standard light
microscope.
Proliferation assay. For proliferation and cell viability studies, cells were
plated in quadruplets at a density of 25,000 per well in a 96-well-plate in
SFM and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated with BMP2
(30 ng/mL), BMP5 (200 ng/mL), or in combination with human
recombinant IGF-I (kindly provided by Ipsen Pharma) at indicated
concentrations for 96 h. Medium and substances were renewed every
24 h. For time-dependent proliferation studies, cells were seeded at a
density of 150,000 per well in a 24-well plate (n = 3) and treated with BMP2
(30 ng/mL) or vehicle for the indicated time points. For cell proliferation
assay, 5-bromo-2’-deoxyurdine (BrdUrd) was added to the cells, whereas,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reagent (MTT)
was used to test cell viability as described (14).
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. Protein extraction
and immunoblots were performed as described (18). Phosphorylated
Smad1/5/8 (1:500), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT; 1:5,000), total AKT
(1:5,000, all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and h-actin antibody
(1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) were used as primary antibodies. Quantification was achieved by the measurement of the pixels and adjacent analyses
using the imaging program ImageJ (NIH).
Measurement of steroid hormone levels. NCIh295 cells were
precultured to 80% confluence in 24-well plates. After 24-h prestarvation,
fresh SFM containing BMP2 or BMP5, alone or in combination with
forskolin, was added to the cells. The supernatant of each well was collected
after a period of 48 h, and accumulated levels of hormones were measured
by the appropriate assay. Cortisol was measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys, Roche) and DHEA-S using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Immulite2000, Diagnostic Products
Corporation). For aldosterone determination, NCIh295 cells were incubated
for 48 h with BMP2 and BMP5, respectively, and aldosterone was measured
using a nonisotopic immunoassay for time-resolved fluorescence measurement as described earlier (19).
Transfection and luciferase transporter assay. Cells were precultured
for 24 to 48 h, and transfections were performed overnight ( for MC2-R
study; Metafectene, Biontex Laboratories) or for 4 h (TransFast Transfection
Reagent, Promega). The next day, cells were treated with rhBMP2/5 alone or
in combination with forskolin (10 Amol/L) or noggin (2 Ag/mL) for MC2-R
promoter studies and with 9cis-retinoic acid (9cis-RA; 5 Amol/L) or phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 10 nmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich Corp.), respectively, for BMP2 promoter studies. After 48 h, cells were lysed for RNA
extraction and further qPCR analysis or for luciferase measurement
(Luciferase-Reporter-Assay, Promega). Firefly Renilla (phRL-TK; Promega)
was thereby used for normalization. Experiments were done with a fulllength MC2-R-Luc promoter construct, several deletion constructs, and a
MC2-R construct with mutated steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding sides
(14, 20). BMP expression studies were performed using either a GATA6
expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Markku Heikinheimo, University
of Helsinki) alone or in combination with a BMP2 promoter construct
(kindly provided by Dr. Di Chen, University of Rochester).
DNA extraction, methylation analysis, and demethylation treatment. Genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA
Purification kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s protocol for tissue
samples. The EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) was used for bisulifite
modification according to the manual. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
for BMP2 promoter studies were performed, as described previously (21,
22). For MSP Locus_1 of the BMP2 promoter region, the following primer
pairs were used: umethylated, 5¶-TTTTTTGAGAGTAGGGAGTGG (sense),

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

TAACCCTAAAACCAAATACCCTT (antisense); methylated, GTAGAGCGCGTTATAGCGTC (sense), CATCGCGAGGCTAAAAAT (antisense).
Locus_2 was amplified according to Wen and colleagues (23). For
demethylation studies, cells were treated daily with 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine
(5-AZA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 96 h (5 or 10 Amol/L). Subsequently, 1 Amol/L
trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma-Aldrich Corp.), as described (24), or noggin
(3 Amol/L) was added for additionally 48 h. After treatment, cells were
washed with PBS, harvested, and RNA and DNA isolated.
Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as mean F SE and, if not
indicated otherwise, calculated from data generated from at least three
independent experiments. P values of <0.05 were considered to be
significant and are either indicated in the figures by ‘‘#’’ for comparison
between the different treatment methods or by ‘‘*’’ for comparison within
each treatment group. Controls [normal adrenal gland (NAG) or untreated
cells] are set in general as 100%. Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)
was used for Student’s t test analysis, as well as for calculation of the
Spearman correlation coefficient.

Results
Expression analysis of members of the BMP pathway in ACC
and NCIh295 cells. To define potential candidates for further
functional studies, we analyzed the expression levels of different
BMPs and their receptors in human ACCs compared with NAGs by
qPCR analysis. Detailed quantification was performed for BMP2
and BMP5, as well as for the BMP receptor subunits, including type
Ia (BMPR1a), type Ib (BMPR1b), and type II (BMPR2). Notably,
mRNA expression of BMP2 (56.1 F 7.2% versus 100.0 F 10.7%,
P < 0.01) and BMP5 (2.6 F 0.6% versus 100.0 F 21.1%, P < 0.0001;
Fig. 1A) was significantly down-regulated in ACCs compared with
NAG (Fig. 1A). These findings were recapitulated in NCIh295
(BMP2, 44.7 F 10.6%, P = 0.06; BMP5, 0.04 F 0.04%, P = 0.02 versus
NAG) and SW13 adrenocortical cell lines (BMP2, 26 F 21.3%,
P = 0.05; BMP5, 0.08 F 0.03%, P = not significant versus NAG;
Fig. 1A). Similarly, expression levels for BMPR subunits were lower
but clearly detectable by qPCR in all ACC samples and with some
variations in NCIh295 and SW13 cells (Fig. 1A, bottom).
In accordance with the expression analyses, BMP5 immunoreactivity, which was detectable in the normal adrenal cortex, was
absent in all investigated ACC samples (n = 4 versus n = 4 NAG,
exemplified in Fig. 1B, top ). These findings were further
substantiated by the determination of pSMAD1/5/8 expression,
which was lower in adrenal cancer samples compared with NAG
(Fig. 1B, bottom).
BMP-dependent pathways are intact and inducible in
adrenocortical tumor cells. To ensure the integrity of BMPdependent pathways in adrenocortical tumor cells, NCIh295 and
SW13 cells were incubated with increasing doses of recombinant
human BMP2 and BMP5, respectively, which showed a dosedependent BMP-induced phosphorylation of downstream SMAD1/
5/8 proteins (Fig. 1C, middle left; Supplementary Fig. S1A). These
effects could be blocked by coincubation with the BMP-specific
antagonist noggin (Fig. 1C, right). Furthermore, both BMP2 and
BMP5 increased ID1 and ID3 expression in a dose- and timedependent manner (Fig. 1D, middle left; Supplementary Fig. S1B;
data not shown). Likewise, BMP2-dependent up-regulation of ID3
was readily detectable also in primary cultures of human ACC cells
(Fig. 1D, right).
Effects of BMP2 and BMP5 treatment on cell proliferation
and cell viability. As BMPs have been reported to play an
important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation in several
tumor entities, we investigated the influence of BMPs on
adrenocortical tumor cell growth. BrdUrd assay revealed a

Influence of BMP2 and BMP5 on Adrenal Tumorigenesis

Figure 2. Inhibitory effects of BMP2 and BMP5 treatment on cell proliferation and cell viability as assessed by BrdUrd (A) and MTT (B and C) assay in NCIh295 (A, B + C,
left) and primary adrenocortical cancer cells (B + C, right). Cells were precultured and treated with BMP2/5 for 3 d. To investigate the time-dependent effect of BMP
on cell proliferation, cells were incubated with BMP2 (30 ng/mL) over a period of 120 h starting the first evaluation 24 h after the first treatment initiation. Data were compared
every 24 h with their untreated control from each time point. Cell viability was measured under baseline conditions and upon addition of the growth factor IGF-I.

BMP2- and BMP5-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in
NCIh295R and SW13 cells (BMP2, 61.9 F 1.7% versus baseline,
P < 0.001; BMP5, 65.5 F 5.3% versus baseline, P < 0.001; Fig. 2A, left;
Supplementary Fig. S1C), which could be further detailed in time
course experiments (Fig. 2B, right; data not shown). Likewise, both
BMP2 and BMP5 also exerted inhibitory effects on cell viability, as
assessed by MTT assays in NCIh295 (Fig. 2B and C, left) and in
primary ACC cultures (Fig. 2B and C, right).
As IGF-I receptor–dependent pathways transduce the most
potent mitogenic stimuli for adrenocortical tumorigenesis (25,
26), we further evaluated effects of BMP on cell growth under
IGF-I–stimulated conditions. Whereas IGF-I resulted in a

www.aacrjournals.org

significant increase in cell viability, these effects were inhibited
by coincubation with BMP2 (Fig. 2B) and BMP5 (Fig. 2C),
respectively, in a dose-dependent manner in NCIh295 cells [IGF-I,
120.0 F 3.2% versus IGF-I + BMP2 (50 ng/mL), 103.1 F 3.4%,
P < 0.01 and versus IGF-I + BMP5 (100 ng/mL), 79.9 F 5.7%, P <
0.001] and in primary adrenocortical tumor cells [IGF-I, 142.1 F
2.6% versus IGF-I + BMP2 (50 ng/mL), 110.3 F 1.4%, P < 0.0001;
IGF-I, 161.0 F 3.3% versus IGF-I+BMP5 (150 ng/mL), 146.6 F
1.8%, P < 0.01].
Taken together, these results provide ample evidence for growth
inhibitory effects of both BMP2 and BMP5 on adrenocortical
tumor cells.

Figure 3. BMP2 and BMP5 reduce
baseline and IGF-I–induced AKT protein
phosphorylation. Cells were treated with
BMP2 (50 ng/mL) or BMP5 (150 ng/mL)
alone or in combination with IGF-I
(100 ng/mL) for 1, 3, 10, and 20 h. Proteins
were analyzed by immunoblotting for pAKT
and total AKT (tAKT, A) and quantified (B)
for the different time points under baseline
conditions and under IGF-I treatment.

BMP2 and BMP5 reduce IGF-I–induced AKT protein
phosphorylation. An increasing body of evidence suggests
that BMP can also signal through SMAD-independent pathways
(10, 27). Thus, we further evaluated potential cross-signaling of
BMPs with IGFs, which represent crucial adrenocortical mitogens
(3), and activators of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
pathway. As expected, time course experiments showed IGF-I–
dependent up-regulation of pAKT in NCIh295 cells, which was

detectable already after the minimal incubation period of 15
minutes (data not shown) and was sustained up to 20 hours
(Fig. 3A and B). Notably, at all time points, AKT phosphorylation
was reduced by BMP2 or BMP5 treatment under both baseline and
IGF-I–stimulated conditions when compared with total AKT.
As AKT phosphorylation represents a downstream mediator of
IGF-dependent pathways, these findings provide evidence for a
BMP-induced decrease of active IGF signaling.

Influence of BMP2 and BMP5 on Adrenal Tumorigenesis

Figure 5. BMP2 and BMP5 down-regulate key factors of the steroidogenic pathway in adrenocortical tumor cells in a dose- and time-dependent (data not shown) manner
under baseline conditions and forskolin-induced stimulation. Cells were precultured and treated thereafter with BMP2 or BMP5 alone or in combination with forskolin and
evaluated by qPCR for the steroidogenic enzyme P450 CYP17 (A) or the MC2-R (B). Furthermore, luciferase assays using a human full-length promoter construct recapitulates
BMP5-dependent reduction of endogenous MC2-R expression (C, left), which is still present in deletion constructs, in which all SF-1 binding sites had been removed by
site directed mutagenesis (C, middle) and also in 5¶ deletion constructs down to a fragment size of 64 bp (C, right). Values for qPCR were normalized by HPRT levels.

Forskolin-induced steroidogenic hormone production is
reduced by BMP2 and BMP5 in NCIh295 cells. In contrast to
BMP6, which has been reported to stimulate aldosterone secretion
in adrenocortical cells (7), both BMP2 (Fig. 4A) and BMP5 (Fig. 4B)
significantly reduced forskolin-induced secretion of aldosterone
(BMP2, factor 2, P < 0.001; BMP5, factor 1.5, P = 0.01) and cortisol
(BMP2, factor 2.6, P < 0.001; BMP5, factor 1.9, P = 0.01) levels,
whereas DHEA-sulfate levels were significantly reduced only by
BMP2 treatment. In contrast, no significant changes in hormone
levels were detectable under baseline conditions with the applied
BMP treatment protocols.
BMP2 and BMP5 down-regulate expression of steroidogenic
enzymes and the adrenocorticorticotropic hormone receptor
in NCIh295 cells. To further detail BMP-dependent effects
on steroidogenesis, we evaluated the regulation of the key
determinants of adrenocortical steroidogenesis, including cytochrome P450 steroid 17-a-hydroxylase (CYP17), cytochrome
P450 3-h-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3hHSD), and the adrenocorticorticotropic hormone receptor (MC2-R). In accordance
with the hormonal findings, qPCR revealed BMP2- and BMP5dependent down-regulation of CYP17 in a dose- and timedependent manner (Fig. 5A, left and middle; data not shown).
Furthermore, primary ACC cells were analyzed under baseline
conditions and upon forskolin stimulation, and in both cases,
CYP17 expression was significantly diminished by BMP2 (BMP2,
44.6 F 1.9% versus baseline, 100.0 F 3.2%, P < 0.0001; forskolin +

www.aacrjournals.org

BMP2, 315.0 F 5.8% versus forskolin, 571.8 F 29.5%, P < 0.001; Fig. 5A,
right). Similarly, 3hHSD and MC2-R expression in NCIh295 cells
could be decreased by 62% and 45% for BMP2 treatment and by
25% and 44% for BMP5 treatment, respectively, at baseline (Fig. 5B;
data not shown) and more robustly under forskolin-stimulated
conditions (3hHSD: forskolin, 505 F 22% versus forskolin + BMP2,
657 F 14%, P < 0.0001; versus forskolin + BMP5, 498 F 49% P <
0.0001, data not shown; MC2-R: forskolin, 1154 F 9.3% versus
forskolin + BMP2, 199 F 6%, P < 0.0001; versus forskolin + BMP5,
125 F 8.8%, P < 0.0001, Fig. 5B, left and middle). Moreover,
coincubation of BMP5 with noggin was able to block BMP5-induced
inhibition of MC2-R expression in NCIh295 cells (Fig. 5B, right).
BMP5-dependent reduction of endogenous MC2-R expression
could be recapitulated in luciferase assays using a human full-length
promoter construct [BMP5 (100 ng/mL), 65.9 F 0.7% versus baseline,
100.0 F 3.7%, P < 0.001; Fig. 5C, left]. Interestingly, this BMP5-induced
suppression in promoter activity was still present in deletion
constructs, in which all SF-1 binding sites had been removed by sitedirected mutagenesis (Fig. 5C, middle), and also in 5¶ deletion
constructs down to a fragment size of 64 bp ( full-length construct:
BMP5, 71.7 F 1.4% versus baseline, P < 0.01, 64 bp fragment: BMP5,
64.8 F 1.9% versus baseline, P < 0.001; Fig. 5C, right), which contains
two consensus sequences for E-box elements (CACGTG).
Taken together, these findings show that BMP2 and BMP5 are able
to down-regulate genes involved in steroidogenesis in adrenocortical
tumor cells, thus, modulating their steroidogenic capacity.

BMP2 can be reconstituted in adrenocortical tumor cells by
GATA6, retinoid acid, and phorbol ester treatment. Promoter
sequence analysis and functional studies have identified a number
of transcription factors, including Sox9, nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB),
and GATA transcription factors, to be involved in transcriptional
regulation of BMP2 and BMP5 in nonadrenal cells (28, 29).
Furthermore, retinoic acid compounds and the phorbol ester PMA
have been reported to stimulate BMP2 (30). Upon screening of ACC
samples for altered expression pattern of these transcription
factors, significant lower expression for Sox9 (ACC, 18.4 F 1.5%
versus NAG, 100.0 F 8.7%; P < 0.0001; data not shown) and GATA6
(ACC, 29.1 F 7.2% versus NAG, 100.0 F 13.7%; P < 0.0001) were
found in ACC samples, as well as in NCIh295 and SW13 cell lines
(Fig. 6A, left). Interestingly, overexpression of GATA6, as well as
treatment with 9cis-RA and PMA, was able to induce endogenous
BMP5 expression (GATA6, 3100 F 1667%, P < 0.0001; 9cis-RA,
432.8 F 276.6%, P = not significant; PMA, 2414 F 1016%, P < 0.0001
versus baseline, 100.0 F 14.7%; Fig. 6A, middle). Similarly, GATA6

overexpression and incubation with 9cis-RA and PMA also
stimulated BMP2 promoter activity, which was further amplified
by cotreatment with GATA6 overexpression (9cis-RA + GATA6,
+65% versus 9cis-RA alone; P < 0.01; PMA + GATA6, +596%;
P < 0.001 versus PMA alone; Fig. 6A, right).
Demethylation of the BMP2 promoter region is associated
with modulation of BMP-dependent pathways in adrenocortical tumor cells. Gene silencing by hypermethylation represents
an epigenetic phenomenon that has been postulated as a possible
mechanism resulting in the loss of BMP expression in gastric and
colorectal cancer cells (21, 23, 31). Thus, MSP was used to study
methylation of the BMP2 promoter region in adrenocortical
tissues. However, analysis of ACC samples revealed the presence
of both methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) alleles at two
different CpG islands within the BMP2 promoter region, which was
indistinguishable from those of NAG (Supplementary Fig. S2B),
indicating that hypermethylation of these CpG islands seem not to
have major effect on the loss of BMP2 expression in vivo.

Figure 6. GATA6 overexpression and pharmacologic demethylation induce reactivation of BMP-dependent pathways in adrenocortical NCIh295 cells. Expression
analysis of GATA6 in ACC and adrenocortical tumor cell lines show lower expression levels (A, left) compared with NAG. Overexpression of GATA6, as well as
incubation with 9cis-RA and PMA, is able to up-regulate endogenous BMP5 (A, middle ) and BMP2 promoter activity in NCIh295 cells, whereas this effect is further
amplified by concomitant GATA6 overexpression (A, right ). Demethylation treatment with 5-AZA is accompanied by lower BMP2 promoter methylation as
evident by MSP (B, left), increase in endogenous BMP2 expression (B, right ), up-regulation of ID3 expression (C, left), and down-regulation of CYP17 (C, right ), as
assessed by qPCR. ID3 up-regulation can be antagonized by cotreatment with noggin (C, left).

Influence of BMP2 and BMP5 on Adrenal Tumorigenesis

Independent from the pathophysiologic cause of BMP downregulation in ACC, pharmacologic demethylation of CpG islands can
be used to modify gene silencing in a given tumor. In accordance
with this notion, treatment of NCIh295 cells with the demethylation
agent 5-AZA resulted in a dose-dependent demethylation (by 30%
for the 5 Amol/L 5-AZA incubation and by 41% for the 10 Amol/L
5-AZA incubation) of the BMP2 promoter region (Fig. 6B, left). As an
indication of the functional relevance of this demethylation
treatment, qPCR analysis detected up-regulation of endogenous
BMP2 expression levels (5-AZA: 5 Amol/L, 226.9 F 32.3%; P < 0.01;
10 Amol/L, 223.6 F 32.5% versus baseline, 100.0 F 2.8%, P < 0.001;
Fig. 6B, right), as well as reactivation of BMP-dependent pathways
after 5-AZA treatment with up-regulation of ID3 expression levels
(5 Amol/L, 409.0 F 57.1% versus baseline, 100.0 F 3.2%, P < 0.0001;
Fig. 6C, left). Whereas the histone deacetylation inhibitor TSA alone
failed to activate ID3 up-regulation (104.3 F 15.9% versus baseline,
100.0 F 3.2%, P = 0.72), it further increased 5-AZA–dependent
induction of ID3 expression. These demethylation-dependent effects
on ID3 expression could be abolished by cotreatment with the
specific BMP antagonist noggin (Fig. 6C, left). Furthermore, 5-AZA–
induced demethylation was accompanied by down-regulation of
CYP17 expression levels (Fig. 6C, right), which could be further
intensified by cotreatment with TSA (29.9 F 4.7% versus 5-AZA
alone, 60.1 F 3.8%, P < 0.001), whereas TSA treatment alone resulted
in a considerable up-regulation of CYP17 mRNA levels, most likely
through chromatin stabilization rather than BMP-dependent
mechanisms. Taken together, these results are in line with the
concept that pharmacologic demethylation, including that of the
BMP2 promoter region, is able to modulate BMP-dependent
pathways in adrenocortical tumor cells.

Discussion
In the present study, we show down-regulation or loss of
expression of BMP2 and BMP5 in ACC samples compared with
NAGs. In line with these findings, lower staining intensity of
pSMAD1/5/8 and reduced expression of three of the four ID proteins
(ID1, ID3, and ID4; data not shown) in ACC tissues provide indirect
evidence for functional significance of these in vivo results. Despite
of this aberrant expression pattern, BMP-dependent pathways
remain intact in adrenocortical tumor cells, as suggested by BMPinduced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and up-regulation of ID1/3 in
NCIh295 and SW13 cell lines and primary adrenocortical tumor cells.
Although there is ample evidence that BMPs have a significant
effect as modulators of tumor properties, the potential effects of
individual BMPs on a specific tumor entity is largely unpredictable.
The expression levels of individual members of BMPs not only vary
among tumor tissues, but each BMP also differs in its main
attributes and functional effect, depending on the cell type and
tumor stage, as well as on environmental factors (32, 33). Herein,
we show that BMPs inhibit adrenocortical tumor growth as
treatment with recombinant BMP2 and BMP5 resulted in a doseand time-dependent reduction of adrenocortical proliferation and
viability. Interestingly, the PI3K/AKT pathway, which mediates
IGF-dependent actions on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell survival
in the adrenal cortex (34, 35) is counteracted by BMP as evident
by inhibition of AKT phosphorylation under baseline and IGF-I–
induced conditions. Thus, these data are in line with the concept
that BMP-induced modulation of IGF-mediated signaling could
contribute to the observed growth inhibitory effects of BMPs.
Moreover, we present evidence that BMP2 and BMP5 also
suppress steroidogenesis in adrenal cancer cells. Adding recombi-

nant BMP2 or BMP5 to adrenocortical tumor cells diminished
MC2-R and steroidogenic enzyme expressions in a dose- and timedependent manner, which was associated with reduced mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, and androgen output. SF-1 represents
one of the major regulator of steroidogenic enzyme and MC2-R
gene expression (36). However, promoter experiments including 5¶
deletion constructs and constructs with mutations of SF-1–
responsive elements did not alter BMP-dependent down-regulation
of MC2-R promoter activity. Interestingly, in this short promoter
interval, two consensus sequences for E-box elements are present
that could potentially be targeted by ID proteins through inhibition
of stimulating basic helix-loop-helix factors (37). In accordance with
this concept, only recently, the basic helix-loop-helix factor Bmal1
has been shown to be required for circadian glucocorticoid
secretion through E-box elements on the StAR promoter (38–40).
Thus, whereas SF-1–dependent mechanisms seem not to be
necessary for the observed BMP-induced inhibition of MC2-R
expression, the inhibitory effects on genes involved in adrenal
steroidogenesis could be a direct consequence of BMP-dependent
up-regulation of ID protein levels. As dysregulation of steroid
production leading to hypersecretion and functional autonomy is
a common finding in ACC patients (1), it is possible that the observed
down-regulation of BMPs in ACC samples could represent one of
the modulating factors contributing to this clinical phenotype.
A variety of transcription factors, including Sox9, NF-nB, and
GATA transcription factors, have been implicated in the regulation
of BMP promoter activity in extra-adrenal tissues (28, 29), and a
number of pharmacologic agents including retinoid acids and
protein kinase C activators (such as phorbol ester PMA) have been
described to modulate BMP expression (30). In agreement with
findings from the literature (41), we detected significantly lower
levels of GATA6 in ACC samples compared with NAG. Interestingly,
overexpression of GATA6 in NCIh295 cells was able to reconstitute
BMP5 expression and induce BMP2 promoter activity. Moreover, as
treatment with 9cis-retinoid acid and PMA resulted in further
increase of BMP2 promoter activity, these findings point toward a
potential approach to restore endogenous BMP levels in ACC cells.
Another general mechanism for down-regulation of gene expression in tumors comprises epigenetic events including hypermethylation of promoter regions located in CpG islands
(42, 43). In contrast to methylation-associated loss of BMP
expression, which has been described for prostate cancer and
gastric carcinomas (21, 44), we did not identify methylation patterns
in CpG islands of the BMP2 promoter to be associated with the
observed loss of gene expression in vivo. However, upon treatment of
NCIh295 cells with the demethylation agent 5-AZA, BMP2 promoter
methylation was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, which was
accompanied by reactivation of endogenous BMP2 expression and
activation of downstream pathways as evident by up-regulation of
the ID3 protein. Whereas the addition of noggin abolished
demethylation-induced ID up-regulation, CYP17 expression was
down-regulated upon demethylation treatment. Although these
findings could be interpreted as an effect of the reactivated BMP
pathway, 5-AZA is a rather unspecific agent that certainly affects the
expression of several other genes in this in vitro system. Thus,
involvement of other pathways that ultimately result in increased
ID3 expression and down-regulation of CYP17 cannot be excluded.
Despite its unspecific mode of action, 5-AZA–dependent
treatment protocols for MDS and chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia have been associated with a rather restricted profile of
documented side effects (45). The clinical and molecular profiles of

individual tumors differ underlining the difficulties for a tailored
therapy fitting each patient (46). Thus, therapies that alter global
mechanisms such as chromatin remodeling and epigenetic
silencing might present a promising approach as an anticancer
treatment strategy. Whether demethylation-based therapies can
modulate the phenotype of adrenocortical cancer in a clinical
meaningful manner remains, however, to be determined in future
studies in appropriate in vivo models.
