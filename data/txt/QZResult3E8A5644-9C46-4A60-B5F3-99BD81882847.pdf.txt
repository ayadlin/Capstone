Abstract
The mucin 1 (MUC1) oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed
by ∼90% of human breast cancers. However, there are no effective agents that directly inhibit MUC1 and induce death of
breast cancer cells. We have synthesized a MUC1 inhibitor
(called GO-201) that binds to the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain
and blocks the formation of MUC1 oligomers in cells. GO-201,
and not an altered version, attenuates targeting of MUC1 to
the nucleus of human breast cancer cells, disrupts redox
balance, and activates the DNA damage response. GO-201 also
arrests growth and induces necrotic death. By contrast, the
MUC1 inhibitor has no effect on cells null for MUC1 expression or nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells. Administration of GO-201 to nude mice bearing human breast tumor
xenografts was associated with loss of tumorigenicity and
extensive necrosis, which results in prolonged regression of
tumor growth. These findings show that targeting the MUC1
oncoprotein is effective in inducing death of human breast
cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Mucins are extensively O-glycosylated proteins that are predominantly expressed by epithelial cells. The secreted and membranebound mucins form a physical barrier that protects the apical
borders of epithelial cells from damage induced by toxins, microorganisms, and other forms of stress that occur at the interface
with the external environment. The transmembrane mucin 1
(MUC1) has no sequence similarity with other membrane-bound
mucins, except for the presence of a sea urchin sperm protein-enterokinase-agrin (SEA) domain (1). MUC1 is translated as a single
polypeptide and then undergoes autocleavage at the SEA domain
with the generation of two subunits that form a stable heterodimer
(2, 3). The MUC1 NH2 terminal subunit (MUC1-N) contains variable numbers of tandem repeats that are modified by O-glycosylation (4). MUC1-N extends beyond the glycocalyx of the cell and is
tethered to the cell surface through noncovalent binding to the
transmembrane MUC1 COOH terminal subunit (MUC1-C; ref. 5).
MUC1-C consists of a 58–amino acid extracellular domain, a 28–
amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 72–amino acid cyto-

plasmic domain that interacts with diverse signaling molecules
(6). Shedding of MUC1-N into the protective physical barrier leaves
MUC1-C at the cell surface as a putative receptor to transduce intracellular signals that confer growth and survival (7, 8).
With transformation and loss of polarity, MUC1 is expressed at
high levels on the entire cell surface in a wide range of carcinomas
of the breast, lung, prostate, gastrointestinal tract, and other epithelia (9). Loss of restriction to the apical membrane allows for the formation of complexes with the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and coactivation of EGFR-mediated signaling (7, 10). Overexpression of MUC1 by carcinoma cells is associated with the accumulation of MUC1-C in the cytosol and targeting of this subunit to
the nucleus (11–13) and mitochondria (14, 15). Importantly, the
MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) activates expression of
gene signatures that are predictive of both response to tamoxifen
and overall survival in breast cancer patients (16, 17). In this
context, oligomerization of MUC1-C is necessary for its nuclear targeting and interaction with diverse effectors (18). For example,
MUC1-CD functions as a substrate for c-Src (19), c-Abl (20), protein
kinase Cδ (21), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (22) and interacts
directly with the Wnt pathway effector β-catenin (23, 24) and the
p53 tumor suppressor (25). Other work has shown that overexpression of the MUC1 heterodimer confers anchorage-independent
growth and tumorigenicity (12, 14, 25, 26), at least in part through
stabilization of β-catenin (24). Moreover, consistent with a survival
function for normal epithelial cells, overexpression of the MUC1
heterodimer confers resistance of carcinoma cells to stress-induced
apoptosis by a mechanism mediated in part through suppression of
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS; refs. 14, 27–29).
The present results show that targeting MUC1-C oligomerization blocks nuclear localization of MUC1-C and induces growth arrest and death of human breast cancer cells. The findings also
show that inhibiting MUC1-C is highly effective in the treatment
of human breast tumor xenografts in nude mice.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Human MCF-7
breast cancer cells and 293 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% HI-FBS,
antibiotics, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. Primary human breast cancer cells
isolated from a malignant pleural effusion were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% serum. Human MCF-10A breast epithelial cells were grown in
mammary epithelial cell growth medium (Lonza). Cells were treated with
GO-201, GO-202, or CP-1 peptides synthesized by MIT Biopolymer Laboratory and AnaSpec, Inc. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion.
Analysis of cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and necrosis. Cells
were harvested, washed with PBS, fixed with 80% ethanol, and incubated
in PBS containing 40 μg/mL RNase and 40 μg/mL propidium iodide for
30 min at 37°C. Cell cycle distribution and sub-G1 DNA content were

determined by flow cytometry. For assessment of cell membrane integrity,
cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL propidium iodide/PBS for 5 min at
room temperature and then monitored by flow cytometry as described
(29, 30). In the absence of other markers of apoptosis, uptake of propidium
iodide reflects loss of membrane integrity indicative of necrosis (30).
Human breast tumor xenograft models. BALB/c nu/nu female mice
(Charles River Laboratories) were implanted s.c. with 17-β-estradiol plugs
(0.72 mg; Innovative Research) using a trocar gun. After 24 h, 1 × 107 ZR-751 or MCF-7 cells were injected s.c. in the flank. MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 107)
were similarly injected into mice without estradiol implants. When tumors
were detectable, the mice were pair matched into treatment and control
groups. Mice bearing tumors that were not within 10% of the mean volume
were not included in the treatment and control groups. Each group
contained 5 to 10 mice, each of which was ear tagged and followed
throughout the study. Initial dosing was given at the time of pair matching
(day 1). PBS (vehicle), GO-201, GO-202, and CP-1 were given daily by i.p.
injection. Mice were weighed twice weekly. Tumor volume (V) was calculated using the formula V = L2 × W / 2, wherein L and W are the larger and
smaller diameters, respectively.

Results
Effects of GO-201 on MUC1 oligomer formation. The MUC1CD contains a CQC motif, which is necessary for the formation of
oligomers (18). To determine whether MUC1 oligomerization is
druggable, we synthesized a peptide derived from the NH2 terminal
region of MUC1-CD, which contains the CQC motif (GO-201;
Fig. 1A). A poly D-arginine transduction domain was included in
the synthesis to facilitate the entry of the peptide into the cells
(Fig. 1A; ref. 31). As a control, a similar peptide was synthesized
in which the CQC motif was altered to AQA (CP-1; Fig. 1A). To
assess binding of the peptides to MUC1-CD, we immobilized Histagged MUC1-CD to a BIAcore sensor chip. GO-201 bound to HisMUC1-CD with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 30 nmol/L (Fig. 1B),
which is similar to that obtained for binding of full-length MUC1CD dimers (18). By contrast, there was no apparent binding of CP-1
(data not shown). Purified His-tagged MUC1-CD forms oligomers as
detected by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1C). Incubation of His-MUC1-CD with GO-201 substantially decreased oligomer formation with an increase in monomers (Fig. 1C). Moreover,
incubation with CP-1 had little effect (Fig. 1C). To assess effects on
MUC1 oligomerization in vivo, 293 cells were transfected with vectors expressing GFP-MUC1-CD and Flag-MUC1-CD (Fig. 1D, left).
Complexes of GFP-MUC1-CD and Flag-MUC1-CD were detectable
by coprecipitation of lysates from cells not exposed to GO-201
(Fig. 1D, right). In concert with the in vitro results, incubation of
the transfected 293 cells with GO-201 was associated with the disruption of the interaction between Flag-MUC1-CD and GFP-MUC1CD (Fig. 1D, right). In addition, CP-1 had no apparent effect (Fig. 1D,
right). These results indicate that GO-201 binds to MUC1-CD and
blocks formation of MUC1-CD oligomers in vitro and in cells.
GO-201 disrupts MUC1-C function. To assess peptide uptake,
ZR-75-1 cells were incubated with 5 μmol/L FITC-labeled GO-201
(Fig. 2A). At 2 hours, analysis of the cells by flow cytometry showed
a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity with a mean fluorescence index (MFI) of 145 (Fig. 2A). Further increases in MFI were
identified at 6 and 24 hours (Fig. 2A). Treatment of ZR-75-1 cells with
5 μmol/L GO-201 or CP-1 for 3 days had no effect on cellular MUC1C levels (Fig. 2B). However, in concert with effects on oligomerization, treatment with GO-201, and not CP-1, was associated with
decreases in nuclear MUC1-C (Fig. 2B). Down-regulation of nuclear
MUC1-C levels was also observed in the response of MCF-7 cells to
GO-201 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Previous work has

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (12). June 15, 2009

shown that MUC1-C decreases intracellular ROS levels (27–29). To
determine whether targeting of MUC1-C with GO-201 disrupts
redox balance, we incubated GO-201–treated ZR-75-1 cells with cH2DCFDA and ROS-mediated oxidation of the fluorochrome was
assayed by flow cytometry. The results show that treatment with
GO-201, and not CP-1, increases intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 2C).
Similar results were obtained with MCF-7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Increases in ROS above the reducing capacity of the cell
can result in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks. The recognition of such DNA damage is associated with the activation of the
ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM) and Rad-3–related kinases,
which in turn phosphorylate the histone variant H2AX and the
checkpoint-1 kinase (Chk1; ref. 32). In concert with this model and
the observed increases in ROS, treatment of ZR-75-1 breast cancer
cells with GO-201 was associated with activation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk1 (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained
when MCF-7 cells were treated with GO-201 (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
These findings indicate that GO-201 disrupts MUC1 function and
redox balance and, in turn, activates the DNA damage response.
GO-201 induces S phase arrest and death. To determine
whether exposure to GO-201 affects growth, ZR-75-1 cells were
treated with 5 μmol/L GO-201 for 3 days and monitored for cell
cycle distribution. Significantly and consistent with activation of
the DNA damage response, there was a substantial arrest in the
S phase compared with that in cells left untreated or treated with
CP-1 (Fig. 3A). By day 4, the S-phase population was decreased, potentially through attrition by cell death (Fig. 3A). There was little, if
any, accumulation of cells with a distinct sub-G1 DNA peak to support the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Moreover, there was no
detectable activation of caspase-3 (data not shown). However, oxidative stress is also associated with nonapoptotic forms of death,
which include necrosis (33). In this regard, treatment of ZR-75-1
cells with GO-201, and not CP-1, was associated with the appearance of cells with DNA that had undergone extensive degradation
consistent with necrosis (Fig. 3B). In addition, treatment with GO201 was associated with uptake of propidium iodide as a measure of
loss of membrane integrity, which was detectable by day 3 and
more prominent by day 4 (Fig. 3B). The MCF-7 cells responded similarly to GO-201 with the arrest of growth in the S phase and the
absence of cells with a distinct sub-G1 peak (Fig. 3C). Treatment
of MCF-7 cells with GO-201 was also associated with loss of membrane integrity (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that GO-201 inhibits growth and induces necrosis of human breast cancer cells.
However, given potential difficulties in distinguishing late apoptosis
from necrosis (30), the results do not exclude the possibility that
some of the cells may have died by a late apoptotic response.
GO-201 targets MUC1-expressing breast carcinoma cells.
Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells express endogenous
MUC1 (7), but unlike ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 cells, these cells are negative for ER, PR, and ErbB2 (triple negative; ref. 34). Notably, as
found for ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 cells, GO-201, and not CP-1, treatment was associated with the arrest of MDA-MB-231 cell growth
(Fig. 4A), accumulation of cells in S phase with the absence of a
distinct sub-G1 peak (data not shown), and the loss of cell membrane integrity (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, GO-201
treatment of MUC1-expressing primary breast cancer cells in
short-term culture resulted in growth arrest (Fig. 4B) and death
(Fig. 4C). In contrast to these results, GO-201 had no effect on
growth of MUC1-negative 293 kidney epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Studies were also performed on the MCF-10A nontransformed mammary epithelial cell line (35, 36), which

expresses MUC1, but at levels lower than that found in ZR-75-1
and MCF-7 cells (8). Unlike the breast cancer cells, GO-201 had
no effect on MCF-10A cell growth (Fig. 4D), cell cycle distribution
(Supplementary Fig. S4), or death (data not shown). These findings
indicate that GO-201 targets breast carcinoma cells that are addicted to endogenous MUC1.
GO-201 inhibits tumorigenicity of estrogen-dependent and
estrogen-independent breast cancers. To assess antitumor activity, ZR-75-1 cells were implanted s.c. into the flanks of nude mice.
Mice bearing tumors of ∼150 mm3 were treated with GO-201 at
doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg/d. Administration of GO-201 at 10 mg/
kg/d × 21 days slowed growth compared with that obtained with
vehicle (PBS) alone or with CP-1 given at 50 mg/kg/d × 21 days
(Fig. 5A). In addition, administration of GO-201 at 50 mg/kg/d had
no effect on body weight (Supplementary Fig. S5) and blocked tumor
growth over the initial 6 days of treatment (Fig. 5A). Consequently,
treatment was stopped, and there was no detectable growth of the
tumors over the next 17 days (Fig. 5A). To assess in part the basis for

www.aacrjournals.org

the activity, tumors harvested on day 24 from control and GO-201–
treated (50 mg/kg/d) mice were examined by histopathology.
Tumors from the treated mice were markedly necrotic compared
with that from mice treated with the vehicle or CP-1 (Fig. 5B). In
other studies with somewhat larger tumors (∼275 mm3), administration of GO-201 at an intermediate dose of 30 mg/kg/d × 21 days
was also associated with the arrest of tumor growth (Fig. 5C). Moreover, these tumors exhibited areas with necrosis, cellular debris, and
swollen cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 5D).
To extend these findings, additional groups of 10 mice bearing
ZR-75-1 tumors were treated with GO-201 at 30 mg/kg/d × 21 days
and followed for longer periods (Fig. 6A). The GO-201 dose of 30 mg/
kg/d was selected based on the findings that 10 mg/kg/d partially
inhibits tumor growth compared with complete growth inhibition
at both 30 and 50 mg/kg/d. In addition and to determine whether
this activity is dependent on all 15 MUC1 amino acids in GO-201,
we synthesized GO-202, a shorter CQCRRKN peptide with the poly
D-arginine transduction domain (Supplementary Fig. S6). As found

with GO-201, treatment of ZR-75-1 cells with GO-202 in vitro was
associated with growth arrest and induction of necrosis (Supplementary Fig. S6; data not shown). Moreover, like GO-201, treatment
of ZR-75-1 tumors with GO-202 at 30 mg/kg/d × 21 days resulted in
the arrest of growth (Fig. 6A). Significantly, tumors treated with GO201 or GO-202 were no longer palpable by days 49 to 56 (Fig. 6A). On
day 63, one mouse from each treated group was sacrificed to assess
the s.c. region implanted with ZR-75-1 tumor cells. There was no visual evidence for the remaining tumor at the implantation site or
spread to other organs. Histopathologic examination of the implan-

tation site further supported the absence of tumor cells (Fig. 6B).
The remaining nine mice in each treatment group are being followed for the reemergence of tumors. As of day 152, none of the nine
remaining mice in each treated group had evidence for tumor regrowth. To further assess antitumor activity, mice bearing MCF-7
xenografts were similarly treated with GO-201 and GO-202. As found
for ZR-75-1 tumors, growth of the MCF-7 xenografts was arrested by
both GO-201 and GO-202 treatment (Fig. 6C). By day 49, none of the
treated mice had palpable tumors (Fig. 6C). One mouse from each
treatment group sacrificed on day 49 had no visual evidence of the

remaining tumor at the implantation site or spread to other organs.
There was also no evidence for remaining tumor cells at the implantation site by histopathologic analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Moreover, none of the remaining mice have had recurrence of tumors as of day 136. To determine whether targeting MUC1 also inhibits tumorigenicity of estrogen-independent breast cancer cells,
we treated MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts with GO-201 or GO202. As found for ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 tumors, growth of the MDAMB-231 xenografts was arrested by GO-201 and GO-202 treatment
(Fig. 6D). Tumors in the treated mice were no longer palpable by day
42, and on day 49, animals were sacrificed to assess the remaining
tumor. Again, there was no visual evidence for tumor at the implantation site or in other organs. Moreover, histopathology confirmed

www.aacrjournals.org

the absence of tumor cells at the implantation site (Supplementary
Fig. S7B). None of the nine remaining mice in each treated group had
evidence for tumor progression on day 138 and are being followed
for recurrence. These findings with MDA-MB-231 and the estrogendependent ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 tumors indicate that targeting
MUC1 with GO-201 or GO-202 is associated with regression and prolonged arrest of tumor regrowth.

Discussion
GO-201 blocks MUC1 oligomerization. MUC1-induced transformation is abrogated by mutation of the CQC sequence in the
cytoplasmic domain to AQA, indicating that this motif is of

importance to the transforming function (18). MUC1 forms oligomers, and the CQC motif is necessary for this oligomerization (18).
In addition, oligomer formation is necessary for targeting of the
MUC1-C subunit to the nucleus (18) and function of MUC1-C in
maintaining redox balance in carcinoma cells (27–29). Based on

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (12). June 15, 2009

these findings, we reasoned that disruption of MUC1 oligomerization would have the potential to block the MUC1 transforming
function. The present studies show that GO-201 inhibits oligomerization of MUC1-CD in vitro. MUC1-CD forms dimers with a Kd of
33 nmol/L (18). GO-201 similarly bound to MUC1-CD with a Kd of

30 nmol/L. In addition, the demonstration that the mutated
control CP-1 peptide has little, if any, effect on MUC1 oligomerization provided support for the dependence on CQC motif. GO-201,
and not CP-1, was also effective in blocking MUC1-C oligomerization and suppression of ROS in cells. While completing these studies, a peptide (PMIP) corresponding to another region of MUC1-CD
was shown to inhibit binding of MUC1 to β-catenin and EGFR (37).
In contrast to GO-201, which interacts directly with MUC1, PMIP
acts as a decoy to interact with MUC1 binding partners. Thus,
GO-201 and PMIP represent different strategies to inhibit MUC1
function.
Selectivity of GO-201 for MUC1 overexpressing carcinoma
cells. Consistent with nuclear targeting of MUC1 being dependent

on oligomerization (18), uptake of GO-201 in ZR-75-1 cells was associated with down-regulation of MUC1-C levels in the nucleus.
Similar results were obtained with MCF-7 breast cancer cells, indicating that this response to GO-201 is not cell specific. Moreover,
exposure of these cells to GO-201, and not CP-1, was associated
with ROS-induced activation of the DNA damage response, S-phase
growth arrest, and induction of late apoptosis/necrosis. These
effects of directly inhibiting MUC1 with GO-201 are in contrast
to that obtained with the PIMP decoy peptide, which reduces proliferation without evidence for inducing cell death (37). Of importance is whether GO-201 induces death by a mechanism dependent
on the expression of its intended target or if it functions as a
nonspecific cytotoxin. In that context, GO-201 had no effect on

Figure 6. GO-201 and GO-202 induce regression of ZR-75-1, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 tumors. A–C, female BALB/c nu/nu mice were implanted with 17-β-estradiol
plugs. After 24 h, ZR-75-1 (A) or MCF-7 (C) breast cancer cells (1 × 107) derived from xenografts were injected s.c. in the flank. When ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 tumors
were 140 to 170 mm3 and 175 to 225 mm3, respectively, the mice were pair matched into groups of 10 mice and injected i.p. with PBS (closed squares), 30 mg/kg
GO-201 each day for 21 d (closed triangles), or 30 mg/kg GO-202 each day for 21 d (open circles). Mice were weighed twice weekly, and tumor measurements
were performed every 2 d. After 5 wk, the tumors were measured once each week. There was no evidence of weight loss in the treated groups. Points, mean tumor

mice were obtained on day 63 (B), and (c) the MCF-7 cell implantation sites from treated mice were obtained on day 49 (Supplementary Fig. S7A). D, 4- to 6-wk-old
female BALB/c nu/nu mice were injected s.c. in the flank with MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 107) derived from xenografts. When tumors were 240 to 280 mm3, the mice
were pair matched into groups of 10 mice and injected i.p. with PBS (closed squares), 30 mg/kg GO-201 each day for 21 d (closed triangles), or 30 mg/kg GO-202 each

stained with H&E (Supplementary Fig. S7B).

MUC1-negative 293 cells. In addition, exposure of nonmalignant
MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells to GO-201 had no apparent effect. These findings indicate that sensitivity to GO-201 is dependent on a function of MUC1, such as suppression of ROS,
associated with the malignant phenotype. GO-201, thus, seems to
have an activity that is selective for carcinoma cells that overexpress MUC1.
Antitumor activity associated with disrupting MUC1 function. An overriding question was whether GO-201 could be delivered in vivo with an effective therapeutic index, that is antitumor
activity and an acceptable toxicity profile. In addressing this issue,
we found that administration of GO-201 was well-tolerated without apparent acute toxicities. We also found that GO-201 treatment is effective in inducing tumor regression and prolonged
delays in regrowth. These results were in contrast to the administration of the control CP-1, which had no antitumor activity. These

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (12). June 15, 2009

results are explained, at least in part, by the finding that treatment
with GO-201 is associated with the induction of tumor necrosis.
Similar effects were observed with the ZR-75-1, MCF-7, and
MDA-MB-231 tumor models, indicating that GO-201 is active
against estrogen-dependent and triple-negative breast cancer cells;
the latter being insensitive to currently available targeted therapies
(38). The effects of directly inhibiting MUC1 with GO-201 are in
contrast to that obtained with the PIMP decoy peptide that inhibits growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors without inducing complete regressions (37). Importantly, in this regard, the ZR-75-1, MCF-7, and
MDA-MB-231 tumors treated with GO-201 have had no evidence
for recurrence as of days 136 to 152.
Targeting of MUC1 function. Overexpression of MUC1, as
found in human breast tumors, blocks death in the response to
oxidative stress, DNA damage, and hypoxia (14, 20, 26–29). Overexpression of MUC1 also induces anchorage-independent growth

Targeting MUC1 Function in Human Breast Cancer

and tumorigenicity (12, 24). However, there has been no evidence
that targeting MUC1 oligomerization can affect survival or tumorigenicity of human breast cancer cells. The present results with
GO-201 emphasize the importance of MUC1 in contributing to
breast cancer cell survival and tumorigenicity. To provide further
support for the observed activity with GO-201, we synthesized GO202, which also targets the CQC motif. We found that GO-202 behaves like GO-201 in vitro and in the xenograft models, indicating
that the CQC motif is indeed an Achilles heel of the MUC1 oncoprotein. The present results also suggest that the breast cancer
cells studied here are addicted to MUC1 function. In this context,
oncogene addiction has been defined as dependency of a cancer
cell on a single gene product for maintenance of the malignant
phenotype (39). Notably, therapies that target addiction to specific
oncoproteins have been associated with the emergence of (a) circumventing mutations and/or (b) dependence on other transforming genes. Thus, it is conceivable that targeting the MUC1 CQC
motif could result in resistant mutants. Alternatively, targeting

MUC1 could select for the emergence of breast cancer cells that
are dependent on other oncoproteins. Whereas these issues will
need to be addressed in subsequent studies, the loss of tumorigenicity in the xenograft models suggests that targeting MUC1 by
blocking oligomerization can have prolonged effects.
