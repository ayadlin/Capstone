BACKGROUND. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) usually are treated only for progressive disease. However, the discovery of biologic predictors of
a high risk of disease progression, together with the development of newer, more
targeted therapies, could change this paradigm. In this phase 2 study, the authors
tested the safety and efficacy of early treatment for patients with high-risk CLL
using alemtuzumab and rituximab.
METHODS. Patients were eligible for treatment if they were 1) previously
untreated, 2) had no National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 criteria for
treatment, and 3) had at least 1 marker of high-risk disease 17p132, 11q222, or
a combination of unmutated IgVH and CD38+/ZAP70+). Treatment consisted of
subcutaneous alemtuzumab (initial dose escalation followed by 30 mg on Mon-

tectable minimal residual disease. The median response duration was 14.4
months, and only 9 patients required retreatment for progressive disease at the
time of the current report (median follow-up, 17.6 months). Study patients had a
significantly longer time from diagnosis to first treatment for CLL according to
conventional indications than a comparison cohort with similar biologic risk profiles.

CONCLUSIONS. The therapy regimen used was safe and effective for early treatment of patients with high-risk CLL. Further studies will be required to determine whether this early treatment strategy decreases morbidity and mortality for
high-risk CLL. Cancer 2008;113:2110–8.  2008 American Cancer Society.

hronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is not yet curable with
standard therapies, and most patients will die from the disease
or its complications.1,2 Survival from diagnosis ranges from months
to many decades with a median of about 10 years.2,3 The diagnosis
of CLL is now most often made early in the course of the disease
with the routine use of flow cytometry, and biologic parameters can
be used to predict prognosis for these patients. Thus, patients with
earlier stage, high-risk CLL may be candidates for interventions
designed to decrease the morbidity and mortality of their disease.
The best characterized novel prognostic parameters are specific
chromosomal defects that are detected by using interphase fluores-

cent in situ hybridization (FISH), immunoglobulin
mutation sequence analysis (mutation status of IgVH]
gene), and expression of the intracellular protein
ZAP-70 and the membrane protein CD38. FISH analysis can detect deletions of 17q13 (17p132), which
result in loss of the P53 gene and are associated with
a shorter time to initial treatment, poor response to
treatment, and very poor survival.4 FISH also can
detect deletions of 11q22 (11q222), which result in
the loss of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene
ATM and are associated with a poor prognosis.4
Unmutated (UM) IgVH (<2% difference from germline sequence),5,6 ZAP-70 expression (20% positive
cells),7 and CD38 (30% expression)5 also are associated with a poorer prognosis in CLL. In addition,
CLL patients with UM IgVH and CD38 have a worse
prognosis than CLL patients with UM IgVH and
cells that do not express CD38.8 Although the use of
these molecular prognostic markers is relatively
new, sufficient progress has been made to apply this
knowledge to treatment decisions in clinical trials
for CLL.
Universal therapy for all patients with early- to
intermediate-stage (Rai9) CLL at diagnosis currently
is not considered beneficial, and the standard of care
is to treat only patients with progressive or advancedstage disease.10,11 Delaying therapy protects patients
with earlier stage, indolent disease from toxicity.
However, this ‘watch-and-wait’ approach also may
delay therapy unnecessarily for patients who have
inherently aggressive disease. In this subset of
patients with a kinetically more active form of CLL,
earlier treatment when the disease burden is low theoretically could decrease the risk of clonal evolution,
which probably is an important factor in disease progression and resistance to treatment.12,13 In addition,
newer and potentially less toxic therapies, such as
lymphocyte-targeted monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs),
are known as most effective before the development
of bulky adenopathy and splenomegaly.14 Therefore,
in the current study, we tested the efficacy and safety
of a regimen that combined alemtuzumab (CAMPATH 1H; Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass) and rituximab
(Rituxan; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) in patients
with earlier stage, high-risk CLL based on the biologic
characteristics of their disease.
The combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab
was used because these MoAbs have different molecular targets, could have different mechanisms of
action, and are reported to have complementary activity in tissue sites involved with CLL. Alemtuzumab
is specific for the CD52 antigen, which is expressed
at high levels by CLL cells,15 and is effective as initial16,17 and salvage18,19 therapy for CLL. In CLL,

2111

alemtuzumab is very effective at clearing circulating
leukemic cells and has appreciable activity against
malignant lymphocytes in the bone marrow (BM),
but it is less effective against leukemic cells in the
lymph nodes.16,19 Alemtuzumab is effective therapy
for many patients with 17p132 or P53 mutation who
are resistant to purine analogues.20 Although clinical
trials have demonstrated only limited single-agent
activity for rituximab in CLL,21 chemoimmunotherapy combinations of purine analogues and rituximab
are highly effective for the treatment of CLL.22-24 In
CLL, rituximab tends to be more effective at decreasing lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly than alemtuzumab, but it is less effective in clearing tumor
cells from the BM.14,25 These data suggesting that the
combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab could
be an effective therapy for CLL are supported by a
study of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic
B-cell lymphoid malignancies who had a response
rate of 52% with 8% complete responses (CR).14 In
the current study, we report on the treatment of 30
patients with early- to intermediate-stage, high-risk
CLL who did not meet the conventional criteria for
therapy. This study is an initial step to determine
whether a short course alemtuzumab and rituximab
therapy can achieve a clinically relevant delay in the
need for conventional therapy in patients with earlier
stage high-risk CLL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all patients were enrolled
with written informed consent. Sequential patients
who were seen in the Division of Hematology at
Mayo Clinic, Rochester from January 2005 to June
2007 were evaluated for eligibility. Patients were eligible for the study if they had CLL diagnosed by flow
cytometric analysis of peripheral blood, early to intermediate clinical stage disease (Rai 0-II),9 did not
fulfill criteria for treatment of their disease as defined
by the National Cancer Institute-Working Group criteria of 1996 (NCI-WG96),11 and had molecular markers predictive of a high risk of disease progression.
The diagnosis of CLL required an absolute lymphocyte count >5 3 109/L, monoclonal B lymphocytes
with a CLL immunophenotype,11,26 and FISH analysis with an IgH probe to exclude mantle cell lymphoma. Risk of disease progression was determined
using interphase FISH analysis of peripheral blood,27
IgVH mutation analysis,28 and expression of CD3828
and ZAP-70,29 as described previously. Patients were
considered to be at high risk of disease progression if

2112

they had at least 1 of the following: 1) 17p132 by
FISH analysis, 2) 11q222 by FISH analysis, and 3)
UM IgVH (<2% sequence variation from germline)
and ZAP-70 expression (20% cells positive on flow
cytometry) and/or CD38 expression (30% cells
positive on flow cytometry).
All patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to
2 and adequate organ function (serum creatinine
1.5 times the upper limit of normal [UNL], total bilirubin 3 times the UNL, and serum aspartate aminotransferase 3 times the UNL). Exclusion criteria
included any previous treatment for CLL, evidence of
active autoimmune disease, and any another active,
primary malignancy that required treatment or that
limited expected survival to 2 years.

Therapy
The duration of treatment was 31 days. Patients
received subcutaneous alemtuzumab with dose escalation (3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg) over the first 3 days
(Wednesday through Friday) and then received 30
mg per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for
the next 4 weeks. Rituximab therapy was started on
Day 8 (375 mg/m2 intravenously at a standard infusion rate) and then was repeated weekly for a total of
4 doses. This regimen design ensured that the first
dose of rituximab was given after the circulating lymphocyte count had been decreased by alemtuzumab
therapy to decrease the risk of a ‘first-dose’ reaction.
The first 3 doses of alemtuzumab and all doses of
rituximab were premedicated with acetaminophen
and diphenhydramine. Patients received allopurinol
(300 mg per day) for the first 14 days of therapy.
All patients received prophylaxis for Pneumocystis
pneumonia and herpes simplex and varicella zoster
viruses during treatment and then for an additional 6
months. Patients were monitored for cytomegalovirus
(CMV) reactivation by polymerase chain reaction
analysis for viral DNA weekly during treatment and
then monthly for 6 months.
Response Evaluation
Patients were evaluated for the effects of treatment by
physical examination and blood testing weekly during
treatment, then monthly for 6 months, and then at 9
months and 12 months after the completion of therapy. Response to treatment was measured 2 months
after the completion of therapy by physical examination, complete blood count, and a BM aspirate and biopsy. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was measured
in peripheral blood weekly during treatment, then
monthly for 6 months, and at 9 months and 12

months after the completion of therapy. The MRD
analysis was performed by flow cytometry on the
patient’s blood. Lymphocytes were distinguished from
other mononuclear peripheral blood cells by forwardand side-scatter parameters (lymphocyte gate). This
population of cells was then examined using 3-color
flow cytometry for cells that coexpressed CD19 and
CD5 and had dim or absent expression of CD79b. The
method was capable of detecting 1:104 CLL lymphocytes but was less sensitive than the more complex 4color MRD assays that were developed after the study
was initiated.30 Cytopenia caused by the treatment
protocol was monitored weekly during treatment,
then monthly for 6 months, and at 9 months and 12
months after the completion of treatment. The percentages of T cells (CD4-positive and CD8-positive)
and natural killer (NK) cells (CD16-positive) in the
lymphocyte gate were measured by flow cytometry,
and absolute T-cell and NK-cell counts were then calculated by using the absolute lymphocyte count.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate response to treatment 2 months after the completion of therapy. All patients initially were
evaluated for response using the NCI-WG96 criteria.11 In patients who achieved a CR or a nodular
partial response (nPR), the BM biopsy was evaluated
with immunohistochemical staining for evidence of
residual CLL B cells. BM biopsies were stained with
T-cell specific (CD3) and B-cell associated (PAX5,
CD79a) antibodies to determine whether the residual
lymphocytes were predominantly T cells or B cells.
In specimens with residual lymphocytes that were
predominantly B cells, antibodies against j and k
light chains and antibodies to CD5 and CD23 were
used to distinguish monoclonal B cells from benign
lymphocytes. Then, patients who had evidence of residual disease were reclassified as having a partial
response (PR), and those with no residual disease
were reclassified as having a true CR.
The time from CLL diagnosis to initial treatment
required by NCI-WG96 criteria was calculated for
study patients and a comparison cohort. Patients in
the comparison group, which was obtained from the
Mayo Clinic CLL Database, had stage 0 through II
CLL, FISH analysis within 3 years of diagnosis, and
fulfilled the eligibility criteria for high-risk disease
used in the clinical trial, but they had not been not
enrolled in this clinical trial for logistic or other nonmedical reasons.

Statistical Analysis
This study was a 2-stage phase 2 trial (Fleming
design). A success was defined as a response (NCI-

Early Treatment of High-Risk CLL/Zent et al

WG96 CR, nPR, or PR) at the evaluation 2 months after completion of therapy. The null hypothesis was
that the true response rate for this regimen is 50%
versus the alternative hypothesis that the true
response rate is 75%. The study had 92% power,
with a 9% Type I error rate, to detect an effective
treatment if the true success rate was 75% versus
50%. Patients were considered evaluable for
response if they were eligible and received treatment.
A minimum of 11 and a maximum of 30 evaluable
patients were required to evaluate the decision criteria. The first-stage analysis was performed after the
first 11 patients were evaluable for response. If 5
successes were observed, then the study would be
terminated; and, if 6 successes were observed, then
the study would continue. At final analysis, if 18
successes were observed, then the regimen would be
considered insufficiently active; however, if 19 successes were observed, then we would consider this
evidence that this regimen is promising and warrants
further study. Assuming that the number of responses
was distributed binomially, a 95% confidence interval
(CI) for the true response rate was calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.
The duration of response and the time to progression (TTP) were evaluated. Responses were
measured from the end of treatment. The duration of
response was defined as the time from the date
study therapy was completed until the date of disease progression. The TTP was defined as the time
from registration until the date of disease progression. The distributions of time-to-event endpoints
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
patients who were event free were censored on the
date of last follow-up.
Fisher exact tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
were used to determine whether prognostic factors
(age, clinical Rai stage, and risk group using novel
prognostic parameters) were similar between
patients who received the study regimen and the
comparison cohort. The time to treatment (TTT) was
defined as the time from the date of CLL diagnosis
to the date of initial treatment required by NCIWG96 criteria. Differences between groups were evaluated using standard Kaplan-Meier methods and logrank statistics. A multivariate Cox model was used to
determine whether receiving the study regimen was
a significant prognostic factor for TTT.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between January 2005 and June 2007, 30 eligible
patients were accrued to this study at Mayo Clinic,

2113

Rochester. Patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 1.

Toxicity
All patients received the scheduled doses of treatment with no treatment delays. Most patients had
asymptomatic skin erythema at their alemtuzumab
injection sites for the first 2 or 3 days of treatment.
Only 1 patient had a symptomatic ‘first-dose’ reaction to rituximab (grade 2), which responded to
standard supportive care. CMV reactivation occurred
in 3 patients (10%) at 13 days, 21 days, and 43 days
after starting therapy. One patient required hospitalization for symptomatic CMV infection and was treated with intravenous foscarnet therapy for
ganciclovir resistance infection, which resulted in a
full recovery. One patient with minor symptoms and
1 asymptomatic patient responded well to oral valganciclovir. Two patients had fever and rashes caused
by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 1 of those
patients required hospitalization for evaluation until
the cause of fever was recognized. There were 3
other nonhematologic grade 3 toxicities attributable
to therapy (an increased alanine aminotransferase
level, which resolved spontaneously; a skin infection,
which was responsive to oral antibiotics; and diarrhea, which responded to supportive care).
The most common adverse effect was cytopenia.
Neutropenia (Fig. 1) was common but was severe
(grade 3-4) in only 5 patients, and there were no
neutropenic infections. There was no grade 3/4 anemia or thrombocytopenia. All cytopenias resolved
without intervention during or within 1 month of the
completion of therapy. Monocytopenia occurred in
all patients in this study with a median nadir of 0.08
3 109/L (range, 0-0.29 3 109/L) (Fig. 1). Patients had
the expected, profound decreases in their absolute
lymphocyte counts with a median nadir count of
0.03 3 109/L (range, 0-0.1 3 109/L). The recovery of
T-cell counts after the completion of therapy was
slow with median levels below normal at 6 months
for CD8-positive cells and beyond 12 months for
CD4-positive cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, NK cells
recovered faster with a median level in the normal
range by 2 months after the completion of therapy
(Fig. 3).
Treatment Response
All 30 patients were evaluable, and there were 27
responses (11 CRs, 10 nPRs, 6 PRs) according to the
NCI-WG96 criteria for an overall response rate of
90% (95% CI, 77%-97%) and a CR rate of 37% (95%
CI, 20%-56%). Resolution of lymphocytosis after the
initiation of treatment was rapid with a median nadir

patients who had evidence of clonal evolution among
those with progressive CLL.
Nine patients received subsequent therapy for
progressive CLL, and some required more than 1
treatment regimen. The initial retreatment regimens
were alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy using the
same schedule (n 5 1 patient); cyclophosphamide,
fludarabine, alemtuzumab, and rituximab (CFAR) (n
5 2 patients); pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and
rituximab (PCR) (n 5 4 patients); fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) (n 5 1 patient);
and rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and

who received subsequent therapies, the median time
from completion of protocol therapy with alemtuzumab and rituximab to the date of initiation of subsequent therapy was 8.5 months (range, 2.4-32.9

received further subsequent retreatment with alemtuzumab and rituximab and achieved responses (PR)
that were at least as good as their initial responses to
this regimen.
The time from diagnosis to first therapy for progressive CLL (according to NCI-WG96 criteria) was

this study and for a comparison cohort from the Mayo Clinic CLL database
with the same high-risk features for progressive CLL who did not receive
early therapy. The time to first treatment for progressive disease was significantly longer in patients who received alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy.

parison cohort. Patients in the comparison group
were similar in age, clinical stage, and risk group
(17p132, 11q222, UM IgVH, and CD381 and/or
ZAP-701) (Table 3). The median time from the date
of CLL diagnosis to the date of initial treatment, as
required by NCI-WG96 criteria, was significantly longer in patients who received with alemtuzumab and
rituximab (4.4 years; 95% CI, 3.1-6.7 years) than in
the comparison group (1.9 years; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7
years; P 5 .001) (Fig. 6). In a multivariate Cox model,
treatment with alemtuzumab and rituximab was a
significant predictor of time from diagnosis to initial
treatment required by NCI-WG96 criteria after
adjusting for age, stage, and risk group (P 5 .001)
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION
We report the first study in CLL to our knowledge in
which patients were selected for early treatment of

Early Treatment of High-Risk CLL/Zent et al

their disease based on molecular prognostic markers.
Early treatment with the lymphocyte-directed MoAbs
alemtuzumab and rituximab was effective and well
tolerated. However, this treatment is noncurative,
and its utility in the management of high-risk, earlier
stage CLL will need further study.
The ability to accurately diagnose CLL in an
early stage and the discovery of biologic markers that
accurately predict poor prognosis allows for the
selection of patients with high-risk CLL who have
low disease burden for experimental therapy. We
used stringent criteria to define high-risk disease
based on previous studies4-6 that suggested the median time from diagnosis to treatment based on the
NCI-WG96 criteria for enrolled patients would be 2
years. To test the accuracy of this prediction, we analyzed patients from a comparison group from our
database (n 5 117 patients) who were not enrolled in
this clinical trial. These patients had a median TTT
of 1.9 years (95% CI, 1.5-2.7 years), which validated
our selection criteria.
Recent developments have greatly expanded the
therapeutic repertoire for patients with CLL and provide lower toxicity treatment options. The major toxicities of the MoAb used in this study are the ‘firstdose’ reactions and immunosuppression. In this
study, there was only 1 ‘first-dose’ reaction that
required additional therapy, which reflects the lower
disease burden, the use of subcutaneous alemtuzumab, and the reduction in CLL cell counts before the
first administration of rituximab. In this study, there
were no serious long-term complications and no
deaths from infectious complications. The CMV morbidity could have been decreased by monitoring and
early treatment for CMV reactivation. Two patients
had unanticipated and severe new allergies to prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole during the
initial posttreatment period, suggesting an aberrant
response by the regenerating immune system. Cytopenia is an expected complication of MoAb treatment. All patients in the study had profound
monocytopenia with slow recovery of these counts.
In contrast, neutropenia was transient and had no
observed clinical consequences. These data on toxicity suggest that this MoAb regimen can be used
safely in patients with CLL provided there is careful
monitoring for complications and a rapid response
to adverse effects.
A potential concern about the use of early treatment in patients with CLL is the development of resistance to drug therapy because of the selection of
resistant clones. Patients with progressive disease
showed no evidence of increased resistance to treatment, and FISH analysis of their CLL cells did not

2117

suggest clonal selection or clonal evolution. These
data suggest that the treatment regimen tested does
not limit future treatment options for these patients.
This phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of the MoAb therapy and provided
the data required to plan a phase 3 randomized trial
comparing earlier treatment to standard treatment.
The significantly increased time from diagnosis of
CLL to treatment for progressive disease using NCIWG96 criteria among study patients relative to that
in a comparison cohort is important clinically and
suggests that a randomized phase 3 study is justified.
The 5 patients who achieved MRD-negative
remissions had the best response durations, suggesting that the extent of response predicts its duration
in patients with high-risk disease. In contrast,
patients who did not achieve an MRD-negative
remission had a relatively short duration of response.
These patients potentially could benefit from longer
treatment, but this likely also would increase the risk
of toxicity. Toxicity could be minimized if treatment
was individualized using response assessed by clinical measurements, MRD assays, and computed tomography scans. In addition, the efficacy of the
alemtuzumab and rituximab regimen could be
improved by the addition of other drugs with potentially additive or synergistic effects based on a better
understanding of the mechanisms of action of the
MoAb and the mechanism of resistance to MoAb in
CLL cells.
We conclude that alemtuzumab and rituximab
therapy for high-risk patients with earlier clinical
stage CLL is a promising new option that will require
further evaluation and development. We intend to
study the regimen in combination with other agents,
including purine analogues and newer drugs, for the
treatment of high-risk, earlier stage, progressive, and
relapsed/refractory CLL. The data from our initial
study, combined with a better understanding of the
mechanism of action of alemtuzumab and rituximab,
could result in the development of more effective
and less toxic therapies for patients with CLL.
