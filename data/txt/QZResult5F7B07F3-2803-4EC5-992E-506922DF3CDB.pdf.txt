BACKGROUND. Desmoplastic small round-cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive
malignancy of young adults, which is amenable to fine-needle aspiration biopsy
(FNAB). As this entity is increasingly recognized and biopsied, cytopathologists
are compelled to become familiar with the range of cytologic features of DSRCT.
In addition, postchemotherapy tumors may be sampled to confirm disease recur-

METHODS. The authors searched their respective institutional databases for all
DSRCT cases with an associated FNAB. FNAB slides, immunocytochemistry, and
cytogenetic results were reviewed.

RESULTS. Six aspirates from 5 patients were identified, 3 of which were postchemotherapy. The postchemotherapy cases demonstrated cytologic findings not
typically described in DSRCTs, including prominent and conspicuous nucleoli,
discohesive single-cell architecture, and slightly larger cell size.

CONCLUSIONS. Cytomorphologic variability was prominent in prechemotherapy
cases, and no case could be classified as DSRCT on cytology alone; immunohistochemistry was necessary for definitive diagnosis. Chemotherapy increased the
spectrum of cytologic features. The most notable difference between the 2 groups
was a predominantly discohesive single-cell pattern with conspicuous nucleoli in
the postchemotherapy group, instead of the clustering pattern of medium-sized
cells with inconspicuous nucleoli typically attributed to de novo cases reported
in the literature. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2007;111:41–6.

esmoplastic small round-cell tumor (DSRCT) is a descriptive
name for a highly aggressive malignant neoplasm of young
people, reported over 15 years ago by Gerald et al.1 DSRCT occurs in
a characteristic abdominal or pelvic location without association
with a specific organ. The typical abdominopelvic location renders
DSRCT amenable to fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and this
technique is increasingly used for initial diagnosis of DSRCT, for
investigation of suspected metastases, and for sampling of posttreatment persistence or recurrence. The typical cytology of DSRCT,
first described by Setrakian et al.,2 has been studied in FNAB of
masses and metastases, in pleural and ascitic body fluids, and in
conventional smears and ThinPrep samples.3–13 Despite aggressive
treatment through surgical resection, high-dose chemotherapy,
stem-cell transplantation, and radiation, recurrence or progression
of disease is common.3,14–18 To our knowledge, no reports address

DSRCT Chemotherapy: Cytologic Features Compared

Institutional computerized databases were searched
for all DSRCT cases with an associated FNAB. This
was a natural-language search using the terms ‘‘desmoplastic,’’ ‘‘small round-cell tumor,’’ and ‘‘small
blue-cell tumor.’’ Six cytologic specimens from 5
patients were identified within a 6 year time frame
(2000-2005). Five of the specimens were from masses
and were sampled by computerized topography guidance (3 cases) or ultrasound guidance (2 cases).
One specimen was from ascites fluid.
On the basis of the surgical cytopathology literature, the cytologic preparations were evaluated for
the following characteristics: cellularity, cohesion,
cell architecture, cell size, nuclear features (presence
of nucleoli, chromatin pattern), molding, nuclear to
cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, cytoplasmic characteristics,
stroma, DNA streaking, mitoses, apoptosis, and background histiocytes. Size was assessed by comparison
to a histiocyte nucleus; cells were considered small
when they were the size of a histiocyte nucleus,
moderate in size when twice as large as a histiocyte
nucleus, and large when they were 3 the size of a
histiocyte nucleus. Stromal quantification was
assessed by examining the presence or absence of
stroma in 20 low-power (4) fields to calculate the
ratio seen in Table 1. Mitoses were quantified as rare
if 1-2/10 high-powered fields and present if greater
than 2/10 high-powered fields. Apoptosis was considered present when single-cell nuclei demonstrated
karyorrhexis or pyknosis. Complete reviews of all
cases were performed by 2 of the authors (A.P. and
K.A.) who were blinded to the chemotherapeutic status of the sample during their examinations.
Available immunophenotypic and cytogenetic
data were collected and recorded. In cases 1 and 2, immunohistochemical results were recorded from stains
performed on the resection specimen. In the other
cases, immunohistochemical stains were performed on
cell block slides. The following antibodies were used:
keratin CAM5.2/AE-1 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), desmin (Dako clone D33), smooth muscle actin (Dako
clone 1A4), muscle specific actin (Dako clone HHF35),
epithelial membrane antigen (Dako clone E29), CD 57
(BD clone HNK1), CD99 (Signet clone 13; Signet
Laboratories, Dedham, Mass ), chromogranin (Dako

munohistochemistry was either review of previously performed antibodies or recorded from reports; no additional
immunochemistry was performed specifically for this
study. Cytogenetic correlation was available for case 2a.

RESULTS
Six cytology cases from 5 patients were reviewed
(mean age of patients, 25.4 years). Locations of the
samples included abdomen, peritoneum, ascites
fluid, ovary (2 cases), and omentum. Three of the
cases were obtained after chemotherapy. All of the
tumors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry
(see Table 2). The single keratin-negative case
showed a t(11;22)(p13;q12). In cases 1 and 2 (a and
b), FNAB was performed on masses after chemotherapeutic treatment of a recently diagnosed (<1 year)
DSRCT. In the other cases, FNAB was performed as
an initial diagnostic maneuver and subsequent resection confirmed the cytologic diagnosis.
Several consistent cytologic features were shared
by most cases. Most revealed cellular aspirates composed of cells with a high N:C ratio (6 of 6), irregular
nuclear membrane clefts (5 of 6), finely granular
chromatin (5 of 6), and a variable degree of DNA
streaking (5 of 6). The exception in all of these features was a ThinPrep prepared slide, where the cells
possessed round, smooth contours with an absence
of DNA streaking. Cells of moderate size were present in all cases (6 of 6); however, noticeably larger
cells (3 of 6) and smaller cells (1 of 6) coexisted in
some cases. Half of the cases demonstrated a discohesive cell pattern, whereas 2 were predominantly
cohesive (see Fig. 1A), and 1 was a mixture of cohesive clusters and single cells. Nucleoli were small but
conspicuous in half of the samples. Molding (4 of 6)
and mitoses (3 of 6) were sometimes seen. Apoptosis
(2 of 6) was prominent in cases 1 and 3, but was not
noted in the other cases. Background histiocytes
were noted in half the cases. Metachromatic stroma

was present (4 of 6) in variable quantities and was
either fibrillar or solid in character (see Fig. 1B).
When separated into chemotherapy and no chemotherapy groups, the chemotherapy group consistently
showed prominent nucleoli, a discohesive smear pattern, absence of mitotic figures, and abundant stroma
(see Table 1 and Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
DSRCT is a rare, highly aggressive, small round bluecell malignancy with a predilection for adolescent
males, and it generally occurs in an intra-abdominal
location without obvious association with any specific organ.1,19 Although this is the recognized definition of DSRCT, this study, in conjunction with other
reports in the literature, helps to further define and
expand the extent of variable characteristics associated with DSRCT. Our cases and others8,19–24
demonstrate that DSRCT must be retained in the differential diagnosis of blue-cell tumors in females,
with women comprising 2 of our 5 patients. This is
the same ratio reported in 1 of the first works on the
topic.25 In addition, our cases all occurred in the
patients’ third decades of life, instead of being limited to adolescence. Reports in the literature also
include patients presenting in the fourth decade of
life,10,11,19,20 and 1 molecularly confirmed case, which
occurred in a 76-year-old female.23 The classic presentation of bulky, nodular, intra-abdominal tumors
is not always the case. Two of our cases were
received as ‘‘ovarian masses,’’ an experience reported
by others.21,22,24,26 DSRCT may occur in other mesothelial-lined regions, including the pleural cavity4,27
or paratesticular region.19,28
The cytologic definition of DSRCT is equally varied. The relatively small literature pertaining to
DSRCT cytology2–13 most consistently describes the
following features: loosely clustered cellular population of round, oval, or spindled blue cells with scant

cytoplasm, irregular nuclear membranes, finely granular chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Metachromatic stroma is usually present. These findings
were common in our prechemotherapy patients. The
metachromatic stroma was the most specific feature
in placing DSRCT at the top of the differential.
Because of overlapping features of DSRCT and
other small round blue-cell tumors, immunohistochemistry can be extremely helpful, and often necessary, for accurate diagnosis. DSRCT possesses a
paradoxical immunohistochemical phenotype of
epithelial, muscular, and neural markers.20 Cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and desmin staining are hallmarks of this tumor, although neuronspecific enolase and vimentin may also show expres-

sion.29 In addition, DSRCT harbors the characteristic
cytogenetic translocation t(11;22)(p13;q12).30 Therefore, with a high index of suspicion for this entity,
particularly in the correct clinical setting, sufficient
material can be obtained from the first aspiration
biopsies to perform ancillary studies.
After diagnosis and initiation of treatment, subsequent FNABs can be obtained to follow response to
treatment or evaluation of new nodules. We observed
differences between the postchemotherapy and prechemotherapy specimens (see Table 1). Consistent
features demonstrated in the postchemotherapy included: prominent nucleoli, predominantly discohesive single-cell architecture, absence of mitoses, more
abundant stroma, and large cell size.

Pre- and Post-Chemotherapy DSRCT Cytology/Presley et al.

The most striking feature consistently noted in
postchemotherapeutic samples was conspicuous
nucleoli. Current literature on the cytology of DSRCT
describes inconspicuous nucleoli as a reliable feature
of this entity.2,5,6,8–13 Only 1 report mentioned conspicuous nucleoli,4 and this sample was not exposed
to chemotherapy. In addition, the few reports that
have included postchemotherapeutic samples either
do not describe nucleolar features in detail, or do not
mention conspicuous nucleoli.3,5 Whether these features are truly related to the effect of decreasing tumor burden after chemotherapy or to sampling effect
could be better determined after examination of larger
numbers of chemotherapeutically treated tumors.
In some situations, the diagnosis of persistent or
recurrent DSRCT after chemotherapeutic treatment
should not be very challenging. In these cases, the
recognition of the unique features that we describe
in chemotherapeutically treated tumors would not
be essential for diagnosis. Nonetheless, some situations may occur where, despite a previous diagnosis
of DSRCT that has been treated, the diagnosis is not
clear. There may be a paucity of FNAB material,
uncertain initial diagnosis, material from an unusual
metastatic site, or a history of another malignancy;
any of which can complicate the diagnostic picture.
Knowing the characteristic features of postchemotherapy DSRCT could aid correct diagnosis of
recurrent, metastatic, or persistent DSRCT. The characteristic cytologic and clinical heterogeneity makes
this tumor challenging to diagnose. However, recognizing the variety of presentations and findings
allows early inclusion in the differential diagnosis
and the eventual correct diagnosis.
