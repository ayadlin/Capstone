ABSTRACT
The clinical management and treatment of cervical cancer, one of the most commonly
diagnosed cancers and a leading cause of cancer-related female death, remains a huge
challenge for researchers and health professionals. Cervical cancer can be categorized
into two major subtypes: common squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma
(AC). Although it is a relatively rare histological subtype of cervical cancer, there has
been a steady increase in the incidences of AC. Therefore, new strategies to treat cervical
cancer are urgently needed. In this study, the potential uses of IFNγ-based therapy
for cervical cancer were evaluated using bioinformatics approaches. Gene expression
profiling identified that cell cycle dysregulation was a major hallmark of cervical cancer
including SCC and AC subtypes, and was associated with poor clinical outcomes for
cervical cancer patients. In silico and in vitro experimental analyses demonstrated
that IFNγ treatment could reverse the cervical cancer hallmark and induce cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that apigenin could enhance the
anticancer activity of IFNγ in a HeLa cervical AC cell line by targeting cyclin-dependent
kinase 1. Taken together, the present study suggests the selective therapeutic potential
of IFNγ alone or in combination with apigenin for managing cervical SCC and AC.

adverse effects of current chemotherapy regimens remain a
major concern. Therefore, the develop-ment of alternative
therapeutic drugs or combination treatments is urgently
needed to improve patient survival and reduce morbidity
rates associated with standard of care therapies.
Precancerous lesions of the cervix typically develop
into cervical cancer over 10 to 20 years. The major histologic
types of human cervical cancer are squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC, 80-85%) and adenocarcinoma (AC, 15-20%) [4].
Although the incidence of SCC has had a marked decline due
to cytologic screening, there has been a rise in the incidences
of AC [4]. Currently, there is no difference in the treatment
strategy between SCC and AC; however, they respond very
differently to treatment [4]. Because patients with AC have a
worse prognosis and lower survival rate than those with SCC

INTRODUCTION
Persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as the main etiological
factor for cervical cancer [1]. HPV oncogenes E6 and E7
are involved in the transformation and immortalization of
cervical cells, and are required for malignant progression
[1]. E6 and E7 regulate tumor growth by forming complexes
with tumor suppressor proteins (p53 and pRb, respectively)
and inhibiting their function [2]. To date, the standard
therapeutic strategy for treatment of cervical cancer involves
a combination of surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Furthermore, effective therapeutic treatments for patients
with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer after platinumbased chemotherapy are still lacking [3]. In addition, the

[5–8], it has been postulated that new treatment strategies
specifically tailored to AC should be explored [4].
Interferon gamma (IFNγ), a pleiotropic cytokine
mainly produced by T lymphocytes and natural killer
(NK) cells, is essential for the function of immune cells,
and innate and adaptive immune responses [9]. IFNγ
has been used in a wide variety of clinical indications
including cancers. The anticancer activity of IFNγ is
associated with its antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and
proapoptotic effects [9]. However, IFNγ can also exhibit
protumor activity involving proliferative and antiapoptotic
signaling [10]. Thus, the outcome of IFNγ cancer therapy
may depend on the cellular, microenvironmental, and
molecular contexts [10]. A better understanding of the
action mechanisms of IFNγ is important in order to create
novel strategies to potentiate its anticancer activity.
In this study, IFNγ was found to be a potential
anticancer agent against both SCC (SiHa) and AC
(HeLa) subtypes of the cervix. Bioinformatics methods
based on gene expression profiling were used to study
the molecular mechanism for the anticancer activity of
IFNγ and design a new strategy to enhance its efficacy.
We found that cell cycle dysregulation was the common
hallmark of cervical SCC and AC, and could be reversed
by IFNγ treatment. In addition, Connectivity Map (CMap)
analysis identified that apigenin, a dietary flavonoid, may
enhance the anticancer activity of IFNγ by targeting
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). In vitro experimental
analyses demonstrated that combination treatment with
apigenin enhanced IFNγ-induced cytotoxicity through the
increases of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HeLa (AC
subtype) but not SiHa (SCC subtype) cells. Therefore,
we demonstrate that IFNγ alone or in combination with
apigenin is a selective therapeutic strategy for managing
different histological subtypes of cervical cancer.

SiHa cells had higher sensitivity to IFNγ; however, higher
concentrations (10~200 ng/mL) of IFNγ did not reduce
the cell viability beyond half. These results suggest that
IFNγ is a potential anticancer agent for cervical cancer
regardless of the histological subtype.
To identify IFNγ-regulated genes or pathways,
a microarray data set (GSE11299 [11]) of HeLa cells
treated with 100 ng/mL IFNγ for 6-24 h was obtained
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
[12]. Next, the alterations of genes in response to IFNγ
treatment were analyzed and ranked using the Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software [13, 14]. The most
upregulated and downregulated genes were illustrated
on a heat map (Figure 1B, left part). To determine which
biological pathways were altered by IFNγ, the top 50
genes upregulated and top 50 genes downregulated by
IFNγ (Supplementary Table 1) were further analyzed
using the Functional Enrichment (FunRich) software
[15]. We then identified the top 5 upregulated and top 5
downregulated pathways, as shown in Figure 1B (right
part). After analysis of these data, it was clear that IFNγ
activated pathways were associated with an immune
response. Interestingly, IFNγ inhibited pathways seemed
to be related to cell cycle regulation and DNA replication,
suggesting that IFNγ might cause cell cycle disablement.
Indeed, IFNγ has been identified as a mediator of cell cycle
regulation in both normal and cancer cells [16–18]. To
confirm the effect of IFNγ on the cell cycle, IFNγ-treated
HeLa and SiHa cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.
As shown in Figure 1C, IFNγ induced apoptosis in HeLa
cells as indicated by the increase of subG1 fraction.
Additionally, treatment with IFNγ for 24 h was shown to
induce G0/G1 arrest in SiHa cells, followed by S/G2/M
arrest and apoptosis after 48 and 72 h (Supplementary
Figure 1). Cell apoptosis was further confirmed by the
Annexin V-FITC/17-AAD double staining. Consistently,
HeLa cells had a higher apoptotic portion than SiHa cells
(Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, IFNγ can inhibit
the cell viability of cervical SCC and AC cell lines by
inducing both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

RESULTS
IFNγ exhibits anticancer activity toward cervical
SCC and AC cells through induction of cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis

Identification of cell cycle deregulation as a
common hallmark of SCC and AC of the cervix

To date, the efficacy of IFNγ and other cytokinebased anticancer therapies remains uncertain, due to
their complex effect on both tumor cells and the tumor
microenvironment. This study sought to investigate
the direct anticancer effect of IFNγ on human cervical
cancer; therefore, an in vitro IFNγ-treated cell culture
model was used. HeLa (adenocarcinoma) and SiHa
(grade II squamous cell carcinoma) cell lines, which
represent the two major histological types of human
cervical cancer, were treated with various doses of IFNγ
for 72 h, after which cell viability was examined by
MTT assay (Figure 1A). IFNγ at concentrations as low
as 0.1~1 ng/mL exhibited anticancer activity toward both
HeLa and SiHa cell lines. Additionally, we found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

It is well known that cell cycle dysregulation
is the major hallmark of many cancer types [19].
Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of cell cycle
progression-related genes by IFNγ could provide clinical
benefits through the reversal of the cancer hallmark.
To demonstrate this, a microarray analysis of human
cervical cancer tissues was performed (Figure 2A). Seven
microarray data sets (Table 1 [20–25]) from healthy donors
and patients with cervical cancer were obtained from the
NCBI-GEO database. As expected, the majority of these
cohorts were SCC cases. Next, the differentially expressed

genes (DEGs; listed in Supplementary Table 2) of each
data set were prepared by the GEO2R, an R-based web
application used to analyze GEO data [12]. We identified
38 upregulated and 10 downregulated genes that were
common in cancerous cervical tissues (Table 2). These
cervical cancer DEGs (CxCa-DEGs) were then analyzed
for biological pathway enrichment using the FunRich
software. As shown in Figure 2A, gene alterations related
to cell cycle progression (DNA replication and cell
cycle, mitotic) and upstream kinases (PLK1 and Aurora
kinases) were found. The parallel of biological pathways
altered between CxCa-DEGs and IFNγ-downregulated
genes (Figures 1B and 2A) may imply the clinical benefit
of IFNγ-based therapy through targeting cell cycle
deregulation of cervical cancer.
To further clarify whether cell cycle deregulation
is a common hallmark between SCC and AC, a data set
GSE39001 (GPL201) containing 29 SCC and 13 AC
cases [23] was used to prepare DEGs (Supplementary
Table 3). The DEGs of SCC and AC cases were further
divided into SCC-specific DEGs, AC-specific DEGs, and
common DEGs in SCC and AC cases (Supplementary
Table 4). These sets of DEGs were shown using a Venn
diagram (Figure 3) that was generated using an online
Venny tool [26]. Next, biological pathway enrichment
using the FunRich software was performed to compare the
similarities and differences between SCC and AC. Only
pathways with 10% or more genes were considered. As
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

shown in Figure 3, genes related to cell cycle progression
and integrin signaling were respectively upregulated and
downregulated in both SCC and AC subtypes; however,
we also found differences between SCC and AC cases.
Genes related to the immune system were upregulated
in SCC cases only, and a larger number of genes related
to integrin signaling were downregulated in AC cases.
In addition, genes related to AP-1 transcription factor
network were also downregulated in AC cases. This
analysis shows that cell cycle deregulation is indeed a
common hallmark in cervical cancer regardless of the
histological subtypes.

Establishment of a cervical cancer gene
signature that is associated with poor clinical
outcomes
To establish a gene signature of cervical cancer
for further analyses, the network of CxCa-DEGs was
reconstructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of
Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database that can
provide the assessment and integration of protein-protein
interactions, including direct (physical) and indirect
(functional) associations [27]. As shown in Figure 2B, the
major network consisted of 32 upregulated genes and one
downregulated gene (listed in Table 2), and was designated
as a cervical cancer signature (CxCa-Sig). Clustering
analysis and heat map visualization showed that CxCa46149

CxCa-DEGs represented the overlapped DEGs from 7 microarray data sets. The network of CxCa-DEGs was reconstructed
by the STRING database. The genes directly linked to each other were used as a CxCa-Sig for further analyses.
Sig was consecutively altered during the cervical cancer
progression from normal epithelium, to intraepithelial
lesion, to invasive carcinoma in two data sets (Figure 4A:
GSE7803 [20]; Figure 4B: GSE63514 [22]) of cervical
SCC patient cohorts. In addition, GSEA was performed to
test whether the expression of CxCa-Sig was associated
with clinical outcome. Two cohorts of cervical SCC
patients were used, which contained responders and
non-responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using
nedaplatin and irinotecan before surgery (cohort 1,
GSE70035 [28]), and chemoradiotherapy using cisplatin
with or without surgery (cohort 2, GSE56363 [29]). As
shown in the enrichment plot (Figure 5A) and the heat
map (Supplementary Figure 3), CxCa-Sig was enriched
in non-responders in both cohorts (p value = 0.00 and
FDR = 0.00), indicating that cervical cancer patients with
lower expression of CxCa-Sig respond better to therapy.
Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis using
the PROGgeneV2 prognostic database [30] demonstrated
that higher expression of CxCa-Sig was associated with
shorter relapsed-free survival (Figure 5B). These results
suggest that CxCa-Sig was associated with poor clinical
outcomes.

cells (GSE11299 [11]) was performed. As shown in Figure
6B (left part), CxCa-Sig was enriched in untreated control
cells with statistical significance (p value = 0.00; FDR =
0.00). Heat map visualization showed that IFNγ could
reverse the CxCa-Sig after 24 h treatment (Figure 6B,
right part). Thus, these results indicate that IFNγ is able to
reverse the gene signature of cervical cancer.

Identification of apgenin as a new drug
combination with IFNγ for treating cervical AC
cells
Because the anticancer activity of IFNγ was
limited (Figure 1A), we attempted to search for original
drug combinations with IFNγ using the Connectivity
Map (CMap) software (Figure 7). CMap is a chemical
genomics database that collects gene-expression
profiles from cultured human cells treated with small
molecules. It can be used to find small molecules that
reverse a specific gene expression profile [32]. DEGs
(listed in Supplementary Table 2) of microarray data
sets with normal and cancerous tissues (Table 1) were
queried using the CMap. From the queried results of the
seven microarray data sets there are six common drugs
(Table 3). CMap drugs with negative mean scores reversed
(or opposed) gene expression profiles with DEGs (Figure
7, upper part). The relationship between CxCa-Sig and
CMap drugs were further established using the Search
Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) database,
which can explore known and predicted interactions of
chemicals and proteins through evidence derived from
experiments, databases, and literature [33]. As shown
in Figure 7 (lower part), only apigenin was linked to
the network of CxCa-Sig through targeting CDK1. In
addition, the average mean score of apigenin (-0.771)
indicated that it was the most potent drug, able to reverse
the expression of CxCa-DEGs (Table 3). To investigate

IFNγ significantly reverses the cervical cancer
signature
Because IFNγ downregulated cell cycle-related
gene expression (Figure 1B), resembling the CxCa-DEGs
(Figure 2A), we hypothesized that the expression of
CxCa-Sig would be suppressed by IFNγ treatment. Higher
expression of CxCa-Sig in HeLa and SiHa cells compared
to normal tissues (microarray data set: GSE29216 [31])
was confirmed by clustering analysis (Figure 6A). To test
whether the anticancer activity of IFNγ in vitro (Figure
1A) was indeed associated with the reversion of CxCaSig, a GSEA of microarray data in IFNγ-treated HeLa

whether apigenin is a common drug that can reverse the
gene expression profiles of both SCC and AC, the DEGs
of SCC and AC (Supplementary Table 3) were queried
using the CMap. As shown in Supplementary Table 4 and
Supplementary Figure 4, five, including apigenin, of the
six common CMap drugs (Table 3) were also predicted in
SCC and AC data sets. Therefore, apigenin was chosen for
combination with IFNγ.
Apigenin’s (APG) cytotoxicity in HeLa and
SiHa cells was analyzed by MTT assay using the
physiologically relevant doses (5~15 μM) [34–38]. We
found that HeLa cells were more sensitive than SiHa
cells in response to apigenin treatment (Figure 8A and
8B, left parts), suggesting that the anticancer activity of
apigenin may depend on the histological type of cervical
cancer. Consistently, combination with IFNγ treatment
further reduced cell viability in HeLa cells, but not in
SiHa cells (Figure 8A and 8B, left parts). To analyze the
combination effect of APG and IFNγ, combination index
(CI) was calculated by the CompuSyn software according
to the Chou-Talalay method [39]. As shown in Figure 8A
(right part), the CI values of each APG/IFNγ combination
in HeLa cells were lower than 1, indicating that APG
exhibits a synergistic effect in combination with IFNγ.
However, the synergistic interaction between APG and
IFNγ was not observed in SiHa cells (Figure 8B, right
part). Furthermore, apigenin enhanced the apoptosisinducing effects of IFNγ in HeLa cells, but not in SiHa
cells (Figure 8C). In conclusion, these results suggest that
apigenin enhances the anticancer activity of IFNγ in HeLa
cervical AC cells.

Two major histologic subtypes of human cervical cancer are
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC).
Current regimens do not discriminate between SCC and AC
patients; however, their clinical responses are very different.
Generally, AC patients have a worse prognosis than patients
with SCC; therefore, more specific therapeutic strategy for
different histological subtypes of cervical cancer are needed.
This study provides a molecular basis for the application of
IFNγ-based therapy alone, or in combination with apigenin,
a dietary flavonoid, for the selective treatment of cervical
SCC and AC. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that cell
cycle dysregulation was a general hallmark of SCC and
AC of the cervix, which can be reversed by IFNγ. In vitro
experimental analyses demonstrated IFNγ’s anticancer
activity against both cervical SCC and AC cells. In addition,
apigenin was found to be an effective combination strategy
to treat cervical AC subtypes. Thus, our study provides a
therapeutic option for treating the different histological
subtypes of cervical cancer in the future.
In a previous study of gene network reconstruction
using DEGs in cervical cancer [40], cell cycle gene
networking was identified as a major driving force of
cervical cancer. Through direct stimulation, cell cycle
genes synergize with E6/E7 oncoprotein-mediated
blockade of cell cycle suppressors, p53 and RB, to
promote cancer progression [40]. More recently, an in
silico pathway analysis revealed that deregulation of
the cell cycle is one of the major trademarks in cervical
cancer [41]. In addition, this study also suggests that
the major components of cell cycle pathway, such as
CDK1/2, could be potential new targets for treating
cervical cancer [41]. However, this concept has not yet
been demonstrated. Our study not only showed that cell
cycle deregulation is an indicator of cervical cancer, it
also confirmed that targeting the cell cycle by IFNγ and
apigenin kills cervical cancer cell lines by triggering cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
The clinical management of cervical cancer remains
a challenge for researchers and health professionals, and the
development of inventive anticancer strategies is crucial.

Because SCC is the predominant histological
subtype of cervical cancer, bioinformatics analyses
described above focus on SCC cases [40, 41]. Currently,
there is an urgent need for analyses to discriminate
between SCC and AC cases. Two previous studies have
been conducted to compare the gene expression profiling
of cervical SCC and AC. They focus on the specific
genes upregulated in either SCC or AC cases [42, 43].
However, our bioinformatics analyses focused on the
biological pathways, not individual genes, to discriminate
both similarities and differences between SCC and
AC cancer. Our results may explain how the different
histological origins of HeLa and SiHa cells contribute
to their differential sensitivity to IFNγ and apigenin.
The anticancer activity of IFNγ was associated with the
activation of an immune response and the inhibition of
cell cycle regulation and DNA replication. Resultantly,
the enrichment of genes related to immune system may
be associated with the higher sensitivity of the SCC
(SiHa) cell line to IFNγ. In addition, the AC (HeLa)
cell line was significantly more sensitive to apigenin
alone or in combination with IFNγ. This may be due to
the downregulation of AP-1 transcription factor network
because apigenin is able to block phorbol ester (PMA)mediated cell survival through suppressing AP-1 activity
[44].
Apigenin is abundant in fruits and vegetables. It
has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
and anticancer properties with high selectivity to cancer
cells and a high safety threshold [45]. A review article
comprehensively analyzes the cytotoxicity of several
flavonoids against different types of human cancer cells,
which are compiled from assorted literature sources. After
statistical calculation of the respective mean parameters, it
was postulated that apigenin is probably more potent and
sensitive in killing cervical cancer cells than other cancer cell
types [46]. Therefore, combination therapy with apigenin and
IFNγ is a promising therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer.
Our previous study has shown that the combination
of apigenin treatment with therapeutic HPV DNA
vaccination generates an enhanced in vitro and in vivo
anticancer effect against cervical cancer [47]. Apigenin
enhances the ability of therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination
to activate IFNγ-producing CD8+ cells [47], implying that
vaccination-induced IFNγ and apigenin act together to kill
tumor cells. Indeed, the direct anticancer effect of IFNγ
alone and in combination with apigenin was demonstrated
in this study. Moreover, apigenin is shown to induce
apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2
cells through the releases of IFNγ [48]. Taken together,
these studies indicate that apigenin may be able to trigger
the production of IFNγ through tumor and immune cells.
Consequently, the increase of IFNγ further potentiates the
anticancer activity of apigenin.
One potential problem for using apigenin as an
anticancer agent is its low bioavailability [49]. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the slow absorption and elimination property of apigenin
may allow it to accumulate within tissues [50]. In addition,
biodistribution analysis for the uptake of 131I-labeled
apigenin in female rats indicates that apigenin has the
highest uptake in the intestine and uterus [51], which may
lead to the accessibility and accumulation of apigenin to
cervical cancer tumor tissues, as the cervix is the lower
part of the uterus.
The bioinformatics analyses suggest that apigenin
targets to CDK1-related pathways. Previous studies indicate
that higher concentrations (40~100 μM) of apigenin are
required for its inhibition on CDK1’s expression and
activity [52–55]. In this study, we found that a lower
dose (15 μM) of apigenin was sufficient to reduce the
expression of CDK1 in HeLa cells, but not in SiHa cells
(Supplementary Figure 5), which may also explain the
differential sensitivity of these two cell lines in response
to apigenin. We proposed that higher concentrations of
apigenin or more specific CDK1 inhibitors may exhibit
higher potency to kill SiHa cells. However, current results
still cannot exclude the possibility that other mechanisms
are involved because multiple cellular and molecular targets
of apigenin have been identified [45]. Further studies are
needed to warrant the targets of apigenin.
There were several limitations in this study. First,
only in silico and in vitro experimental analyses were
performed. Further investigations using animal models
specific for cervical SCC or AC subtypes were required.
Second, only 13 cases of AC patients were available for
bioinformatics analyses. Third, gene expression signaturebased approaches were used in this study. The differences
of genetic mutations, epigenetics, proteomics, and
metabolomics between SCC and AC subtypes should also
be considered in future investigations.
In conclusion, this study employs bioinformatics
and in vitro experimental approaches to investigate the
anticancer effect of IFNγ against human cervical SCC and
AC. In addition, apigenin is identified as a repurposed drug
when combined with IFNγ to treat AC of the cervix. The
anticancer activities of apigenin and IFNγ are associated
with the inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction
of apoptosis. Our study provides an innovative strategy for
treating cervical cancer derived from different histological
origins.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
GSEA v2.2.2 software (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/gsea/) was used to analyze microarray data [13, 14].
Genes were ranked by running a gene set type permutation
test with log2 ratio ranking statistic. Default settings were
used for all other GSEA parameters. Gene sets with a p
value < 0.01 and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were
considered significant.

Pathway enrichment analysis and pathway
reconstruction

absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a multiwell plate
reader. Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of
surviving cells related to untreated control cells. The fraction
affected (Fa) representing the respective growth inhibition
was determined (for example, The Fa value of 70% growth
inhibition is 0.7). The combination index (CI) was calculated
by the CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc.) according to
the Chou-Talalay method [39]. The CI value quantitatively
defines synergistic cytotoxicity (< 1), addictive cytotoxicity
(= 1), and antagonistic cytotoxicity (> 1).

Pathway analysis was performed using the FunRich
v.2.1.2 software (http://www.funrich.org) [15]. For the
pathway reconstruction of genes, the STRING v10.0
database was used (http://string-db.org/) [27]. The
parameters were set as follows: organism = homo sapiens;
active prediction methods = experiments and databases;
minimum required interaction score = medium confidence
(0.400); max number of interactors to show = none (query
proteins only); and view setting = evidence view.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were plated in 60-cm dishes for 24 h, and then
treated with complete medium containing drugs for 24, 48,
and 72 h. Floating and adherent cells were harvested and
immediately fixed with 75% ethanol and stored at -20 °C. Cells
were stained in staining buffer (10 μg/mL PI and 100 μg/mL
RNase A) for 30 min and then analyzed on a flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed by
WinMDI 2.9 free software (Scripps Research Institute).

Chemical-gene connectivity by the Search
Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH)
database
The relationship between chemicals and genes was
analyzed using the STITCH v5.0 (http://stitch-beta.embl.
de/) [33]. The parameters were set as follows: organism =
homo sapiens; active prediction methods = experiments,
databases and predictions; minimum required interaction
score = medium confidence (0.400); max number of
interactors to show = none (query proteins only); and view
setting = evidence view.

Statistical analysis
Means and standard deviations of samples in MTT
cell viability assays were calculated from the numerical data
generated in this study. Data were analyzed using Student’s
t-test, and p values of < 0.05 were considered significant
(*). Hierarchical clustering analysis by one minus Pearson’s
correlation metric was performed using the GENE-E
software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/
GENE-E/). The prognostic impact of the cervical cancer gene
signature (CxCa-Sig) was analyzed using the PROGgeneV2
database (http://www.compbio.iupui.edu/proggene/) [30].
Patient survival data from the GSE44001 [56] data set was
used to construct Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival plot.

Chemicals and reagents
RPMI-1640 medium, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate,
penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Life
Technologies. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased
from Hyclone. Apigenin, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT),
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), propidium iodide (PI), and
ribonuclease A (RNase A) were purchased from Sigma.
Recombinant human IFNγ was purchased from PeproTech.
Antibodies specific for phospho-CDK1 (Tyr15) and total
CDK1 were purchased from Cell Signaling.
