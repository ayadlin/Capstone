Abstract
In metastatic ovarian cancer, resistance to platinum chemotherapy is common. Although the orphan
nuclear receptor TR3 (nur77/NR4A1) is implicated in mediating chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in cancer
cells, its role in ovarian cancer has not been determined. In an ovarian cancer tissue microarray, TR3 protein
expression was elevated in stage I tumors, but downregulated in a signiﬁcant subset of metastatic tumors.
Moreover, TR3 expression was signiﬁcantly lower in platinum-resistant tumors in patients with metastatic
disease, and low TR3 staining was associated with poorer overall and progression-free survival. We have
identiﬁed a direct role for TR3 in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Nucleus-to-cytoplasm
translocation of TR3 was observed in cisplatin-sensitive (OVCAR8, OVCAR3, and A2780PAR) but not
cisplatin-resistant (NCI/ADR-RES and A2780CP20) ovarian cancer cells. Immunoﬂuorescent analyses showed
clear overlap between TR3 and mitochondrial Hsp60 in cisplatin-treated cells, which was associated with
cytochrome c release. Ovarian cancer cells with stable shRNA- or transient siRNA-mediated TR3 downregulation displayed substantial reduction in cisplatin effects on apoptotic markers and cell growth in vitro
and in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that the cisplatin-induced cytoplasmic TR3 translocation required
for apoptosis induction was regulated by JNK activation and inhibition of Akt. Finally, cisplatin resistance was
partially overcome by ectopic TR3 overexpression and by treatment with the JNK activator anisomycin and
Akt pathway inhibitor, wortmannin. Our results suggest that disruption of TR3 activity, via downregulation or
nuclear sequestration, likely contributes to platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Moreover, we have
described a treatment strategy aimed at overcoming platinum resistance by targeting TR3. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy
and the vast majority of epithelial ovarian malignancies present as biologically aggressive, metastatic disease (1, 2). The
high incidence of relapse following standard platinum-based
therapy indicates that there is an urgent need for new treatment strategies and novel insight into mechanisms of platinum
resistance. As most high-grade ovarian cancers harbor mutations in TP53 (3), identifying antitumor effectors that act
independently of p53 is an important goal.

TR3 (also known as nur77 and NR4A1) has emerged as a
major regulator of cancer cell survival and an attractive
therapeutic target (4). TR3 is a member of the NR4A family
of nuclear receptors, and mediates apoptosis in various cancer
cell types in response to a wide range of chemotherapeutic
agents. Known mechanisms of TR3-induced apoptosis include
p53-independent nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation, leading
to cytochrome c release in response to various proapoptotic
drugs (5–11), or upregulation of proapoptotic genes and/or
downregulation of antiapoptotic genes (12–14). Nuclear export
of TR3 is known to involve speciﬁc changes in its phosphorylation status, such as N-terminal serine phosphorylation by
JNK and loss of Akt-mediated phosphorylation on serine 351
(15). At the mitochondria, TR3 binds Bcl-2, which induces a
conformational change such that Bcl-2 assumes a proapoptotic function (9). Apoptosis mediated at least partly through TR3
activity has been reported in an ovarian-derived teratocarcinoma cell line, Pa-1 (5). However, it is unknown whether TR3
mediates apoptotic effects of established chemotherapeutic
agents such as cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells of epithelial
origin.
Despite the clear proapoptotic role for TR3 identiﬁed in
chemotherapy-treated cancer cells, accumulated evidence
indicates that it may play a more complex role in tumorigenesis. TR3 expression is also induced by mitogenic factors in the

TR3 Dysfunction in Ovarian Cancer

absence of apoptosis in various cancer cell types and is
upregulated in some solid epithelial tumors (11, 16–19). In
contrast, TR3 is downregulated in some metastatic solid
tumors (17, 20) and TR3-mediated suppression of colon cancer
tumorigenesis has been recently reported (14, 21). The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) data show that TR3 mRNA expression is
detected in ovarian tumors, although no signiﬁcant alterations
in the TR3 gene, such as mutation, ampliﬁcation, or promoter
methylation, are present in these tumors (3). There have been
no previous reports measuring TR3 protein expression in
epithelial ovarian tumors.
To identify possible roles of TR3 in ovarian cancer, and to
relate TR3 protein expression to clinical outcomes, we ﬁrst
determined its expression in a tissue microarray (TMA) generated from tumor samples from 209 patients with ovarian
cancer. We showed an association between low TR3 expression, resistance to platinum chemotherapy, and survival indices. Then, we identiﬁed a functional link between TR3 and
cisplatin-mediated apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggest that TR3 is an important regulator of
ovarian cancer cell apoptosis and that downregulation or
nuclear sequestration of TR3 contributes to platinum response
and resistance. Finally, this study has implications for future
treatment strategies to overcome platinum resistance in ovarian cancer by upregulating TR3 or targeting TR3 for nuclear
export.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, chemicals, and plasmids
Growth of the epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3,
OVCAR3, NCI/ADR-RES, OVCAR5, and OVCAR8, well-characterized as part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60 Cancer
Panel (22–24), have been described previously (25). A2780 PAR
and A2780 CP20 cells were kind gifts from Prof. Anil Sood (MD
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; ref. 26). Growth of
normal human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) cells has
also been described (25). All cell lines were used within 6
months of receipt from the aforementioned cell line banks and
all were tested negative for mycoplasma. The cells were treated
with the DNA-damaging agents, cisplatin and doxorubicin
(both from Sigma Chemical Co.), the histone deacetylase
inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; kind gift
from Dr. Edward Holson, Stanley Center for Psychiatric
Research; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA), the nuclear export
inhibitor, leptomycin B (Sigma Chemical Co.), the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (Enzo Life Sciences), the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (Enzo Life Sciences), and the JNK activator, anisomycin (Enzo Life Sciences). A 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide solution in
cell culture medium was used as the vehicle control for in vitro
cell growth and apoptosis experiments described below. A
TrueORF plasmid encoding for DDK (FLAG)-tagged full-length
TR3, and its corresponding empty vector, were purchased from
Origene.
Generation of TR3 knockdown cells
OVCAR-8 cells were transfected (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen Corp.) with predesigned pGFP-V-RS shRNA HuSH-29
plasmids targeting human TR3 (ShTR3) or control, scrambled

www.aacrjournals.org

shRNA (ShScr) on the same vector background (Origene).
Additional details regarding selection, characterization, and
maintenance of clones are in Supplementary Methods. For
transient TR3 knockdown, OVCAR3 cells were transfected with
ON-TARGETplus nontargeting (NT) or TR3-targeting siRNA
duplexes (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Inc.) using RNAiMAX
transfection reagent (Invitrogen).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were grown, ﬁxed, permeabilized, and stained with
anti-NR4A1/TR3, anti-Hsp60, anti-cytochrome c, anti-Bcl-2,
and anti-DDK (FLAG) primary antibodies as previously
described (7). Additional details regarding primary and secondary antibodies, and for cell counts, are provided in Supplementary Methods. Images were acquired and analyzed as
previously described (27).
Western blotting
Whole-cell protein isolation, subcellular fractionation, Western blotting, and signal detection were conducted as described
previously (25, 28) to detect anti-TR3/nur77, anti-Nurr1/NR4A2,
anti-NOR1/NR4A3, anti-PARP, anti-caspase-3, anti-b-actin,
anti-histone H3, anti-Bcl-2, anti-DDK (FLAG), anti-phosphoJNK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), and antia-tubulin primary antibodies. Additional details are provided
in Supplementary Methods. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with anti-TR3 on lysates normalized for TR3 expression
were conducted as previously described (28).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were conducted as
previously described (29). Levels of mRNA expression for TR3
and NR4A2 were determined using TaqMan gene expression
assays. Additional details are provided in Supplementary
Methods.
Sulfurhodamine B assays
Sulfurhodamine B (SRB) growth assays were conducted as
previously described (29, 30). Effects on cell growth were
measured 72 hours after addition of drugs. Absorbance was
measured at 510 nm using a Spectramax M5 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) in the High-Throughput Screening
Core of the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology (Nashville,
TN).
Xenograft assays
Four- to ﬁve-week-old female athymic Nude-Foxn1nu mice
were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. For this subcutaneous xenograft model, 5  106 OVCAR8 ShScr or ShTR3 cells
in 200 mL of a PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences) mixture (1:1 v/v)
were injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank. After the
tumors reached approximately 200 mm3 in volume, mice were
randomized and treated with cisplatin (5 mg/kg weekly) or
vehicle control (PBS) for 3 weeks before euthanasia and
necropsy (30). Tumor volume was calculated weekly from
caliper measurements of the smallest (SD) and largest diameter (LD) using the formula: volume ¼ (LD  SD2)  p/6 (28).
Experiments conducted received prior approval from the

guidelines of the American Association of Laboratory Animal
Care.
Case selection and TMA generation
Institutional Review Board approval for the tissue studies
was obtained at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).
To compare TR3 expression in normal and neoplastic epithelium, we obtained deidentiﬁed tissue from human epithelial
ovarian tumors with serous histology and normal human
ovarian samples from the Vanderbilt Translational Pathology
Shared Resource. For the TMA, 209 patients diagnosed with
ovarian cancer at VUMC between 1994 and 2004 had evaluable
parafﬁn tissue blocks. Additional details regarding generation
of the TMA, recording of patient clinical data, and for deﬁnitions of overall and progression-free survival (PFS) and platinum sensitivity, are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Tumor stage and grade was assigned on the basis of the
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics system
(31). Clinical data relating to tumor stage, grade, histology,
and platinum sensitivity of patient tumors are summarized
in Table 1.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue ﬁxation, processing, and sectioning methods have
been previously described (32). Hematoxylin and eosin staining
for histology and immunostaining for anti-TR3/NR4A1, antipan-cytokeratin, anti-cleaved caspase-3, and anti-mib-1/Ki67
primary antibodies were conducted as described (32). Additional details for these antibodies, and for cell counts in ovarian
xenografts, are provided in Supplementary Methods. For the
TMAs, semiquantitative measurement of TR3 expression in
tumors was conducted using the automated Ariol SL-50 Platform (Molecular Devices LLC). Additional details are provided
in Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
For in vitro experiments, values shown were the mean þ SD
of 3 independent experiments with P < 0.05 relative to appropriate controls considered to be statistically signiﬁcant (Student t test). In our mouse experiments, differences between
groups were determined by Mann–Whitney U test. For TMA
analyses, Kaplan–Meier curves were used to analyze PFS and
OS. Survival curves were compared using the Cox proportional
hazards model. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess
statistical signiﬁcance. Differences in TR3 expression related to
tumor stage (stage I vs. II/III/IV), grade (grade 1 vs. 2/3), and
platinum sensitivity or resistance were determined by Mann–
Whitney test.

Results
TR3 expression is heterogeneous in ovarian cancer cells
While TR3 exerts diverse effects in cancer cells, such as
mediating apoptosis induction by multiple chemotherapeutic
agents (5–11) or promoting cell growth in response to mitogenic stimuli (11), its role in ovarian cancer cell biology is

conﬁrmed that TR3 mRNA expression is detected at variable
levels in primary ovarian tumor samples (3, 33) and the NCI60
panel of ovarian cancer cell lines (22–24).
To determine protein expression levels of TR3, we examined
5 ovarian cancer cell lines represented in the NCI60 panel. As
shown in Fig. 1A, TR3 expression was heterogeneous, with
relatively high expression levels in NCI/ADR-RES, OVCAR8,
and OVCAR3 cells. Low TR3 expression was observed in SKOV3
and OVCAR5 cells. We then conﬁrmed that TR3 was detected
by immunohistochemical staining in ovarian tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). Prominent nuclear TR3 expression was
observed in areas of tumor tissue with correspondingly high
levels of the epithelial marker, pan-cytokeratin, and the

proliferation marker, Ki67. TR3 expression was also detected in
the single layer of cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells in normal
ovary (Supplementary Fig. S1), consistent with its abundant
expression in cells derived from normal HOSE (Fig. 1A).
Low TR3 expression in a subset of metastatic human
ovarian cancers is associated with platinum resistance
and reduced survival
To investigate the relationship between TR3 expression in
ovarian tumors and clinical outcomes, we determined the
percentage of TR3-positive tumor cells in each section of our
TMA. As all cells positive for TR3 within the tumor displayed
nuclear staining, with only a small subset of tumors (10/209)
containing cells displaying both nuclear and cytoplasmic
staining, counts were based on nuclear TR3 expression. TR3
expression for each tumor and associated clinical data are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. The median TR3 positivity
in these tumors was 72.1%. No signiﬁcant differences were
observed in TR3 expression in the epithelial tumor subtypes
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Because the majority of epithelial
tumors were of papillary serous histology (140/202), and only
relatively small numbers of other histologic classes were
represented, we chose to restrict subsequent analyses to serous
tumors.

www.aacrjournals.org

As shown in Fig. 1B and C, a high percentage of epithelial
cells in early-stage (I) serous tumors displayed TR3 expression. In contrast, a large subset of late-stage, metastatic
serous tumors showed signiﬁcantly lower TR3 expression.
Lower TR3 nuclear staining was also associated with higher
grade tumors (Fig. 1B), with reduced overall and disease-free
survival (Fig. 1C) and, strikingly, with platinum resistance
(Fig. 1B). We then compared our data with results extracted
from publicly available ovarian cancer microarray databases,
TCGA (3) and Yoshihara and colleagues (33). TCGA data
indicate that 70% (186/268) of ovarian tumors show reduced
TR3 mRNA expression levels compared with normal tissue,
consistent with our results. However, the TCGA data displayed no signiﬁcant association between TR3 mRNA
expression and platinum resistance or survival (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). In contrast, a signiﬁcant association
between low TR3 mRNA expression and reduced PFS, but
not overall survival, was shown in the Yoshihara dataset at
top/bottom 20%, 35%, and 50% cutoffs (Supplementary Fig.
S3C and S3D).
Cisplatin induces TR3 expression in ovarian cancer cells
Our TMA data showed an association between low TR3
expression and reduced platinum response and survival.

However, no direct functional link between endogenous TR3
and platinum response in ovarian cancer cells has been
previously shown. To determine the role of endogenous TR3
in cisplatin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, we
selected 3 ovarian cancer cell lines with relatively high levels
of basal TR3 expression (OVCAR8, NCI/ADR-RES, and
OVCAR3) for further study (Fig. 1A). SRB cell growth experiments showed that NCI/ADR-RES cells were resistant to
cisplatin (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous observations in
these multidrug-resistant cells (27). NCI/ADR-RES cells are a
derivative of OVCAR8 cells (23), which were more sensitive
to cisplatin than NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 2A).
A similar pattern of effect across the cell lines was observed
when cisplatin-induced apoptosis was measured by PARP
cleavage (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, TR3 expression was induced
by cisplatin in all 3 cell lines, including the cisplatin-resistant
NCI/ADR-RES cells after 24-hour treatment (Fig. 2B). These
results suggest that stimulation of TR3 expression alone is
not sufﬁcient for growth inhibition or apoptosis and other
mechanisms play a role.

Mitochondrial targeting of TR3, leading to cytochrome c
release, is associated with cisplatin-induced apoptosis in
ovarian cancer cells
Cytotoxic drug-induced changes in the subcellular localization of TR3 have emerged as a primary mechanism for
apoptosis induction. Previous studies have shown that
various proapoptotic stimuli promote translocation of TR3
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (5–11), often with direct
mitochondrial targeting, and alters function of Bcl-2 to
become proapoptotic (9). Therefore, we evaluated subcellular localization of TR3 before and after cisplatin treatment
by immunoﬂuorescence analyses. Consistent with previous
reports (5–7), TR3 expression was predominantly localized
to 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained nuclei in
untreated ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 2C). Cytoplasmic translocation of TR3 was signiﬁcantly induced by cisplatin in
OVCAR8 and OVCAR3 cells, but not in cisplatin-resistant
NCI/ADR-RES cells (Fig. 2C and D). To determine mitochondrial localization, we showed that the punctate
TR3 cytoplasmic staining pattern in cisplatin-treated cells

association between TR3 and Bcl-2 in cisplatin-treated
OVCAR8 cells (Fig. 2F).
To validate the possible link between cisplatin resistance
and a lack of cisplatin-induced cytoplasmic targeting of TR3
in ovarian cancer cells, we used another well-characterized
isogenic cell line model of cisplatin resistance in ovarian
cancer, A2780 PAR and CP20 cells (26). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, there was a similar lack of TR3 mitochondrial
targeting in cisplatin-treated CP20 cells compared with PAR
cells. To link cytoplasmic TR3 translocation with apoptosis
induction, we conducted immunoﬂuorescence analyses of
cytochrome c release. Cytochrome c is localized to the inner
mitochondrial membrane in untreated cells and following
stimulation with proapoptotic agents is released into the
cytosol to form a diffuse staining pattern (6, 7). As shown
in Fig. 2G and H, cisplatin-treated OVCAR8 and OVCAR3 cells
displayed diffuse cytochrome c staining. The majority of the
cells (>80%) simultaneously displayed cytoplasmic TR3
expression, implicating mitochondrial targeting of TR3 as
a key factor in cytochrome c release and apoptosis. A small
proportion of cells displayed cytochrome c release without

mitochondrial TR3 targeting. Therefore, other mechanisms
are likely to mediate cisplatin-induced apoptosis in these
ovarian cancer cells.
To investigate TR3 in normal cells treated with cisplatin, we
used HOSE ovarian epithelial cells as a model. We showed that
in cisplatin-treated HOSE cells, TR3 expression is not only
upregulated, but found in the cytoplasm, colocalized with
mitochondrial Hsp60 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B reduces
cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cytoplasmic targeting
of TR3
To better understand the link between mitochondrial targeting of TR3 and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, we conducted experiments with the well-established nuclear export
inhibitor, leptomycin B (7). First, we conﬁrmed that treatment
of OVCAR8 cells with leptomycin B before addition of cisplatin
signiﬁcantly reduced the number of cells showing cytoplasmic
localization in immunoﬂuorescence experiments (Fig. 3A). We
validated these results with subcellular fractionation experiments (Fig. 3B). In cisplatin-treated cells where TR3 cytoplasmic translocation was inhibited, we observed a signiﬁcant
reduction in the number of cells showing cytochrome c release
(Fig. 3C) and reduced levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved
caspase-3 (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed in OVCAR3

cells (data not shown). We then tested the possibility that
leptomycin B-mediated inhibition of apoptosis was due to
reduced TR3 expression. However, cisplatin induced TR3 to
a similar degree with and without leptomycin B pretreatment (Fig. 3D). These studies suggest that cytoplasmic TR3
translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was essential for cisplatin-induced apoptosis in these ovarian cancer
cells.
Ovarian cancer cells with TR3 downregulation are
resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro and in
vivo
Having established a functional link between TR3 and
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we next aimed to model the TR3
downregulation observed in ovarian tumors. To this end, we
generated OVCAR8 cell clones stably expressing a GFP-tagged
shRNA plasmid targeting TR3 (ShTR3). We identiﬁed 3 GFPpositive clones displaying substantial TR3 downregulation at
the protein level compared with GFP-positive clones expressing control, scrambled shRNA (Fig. 4A and B). The highest
levels of TR3 expression were observed in ShScr#1 cells,
comparable with TR3 levels in parental OVCAR8 cells (data
not shown). Showing the speciﬁcity of TR3 downregulation,

protein expression of the structurally related NR4A family
members, NR4A2/Nurr1 and NR4A3/Nor1, was not altered in
these TR3 knockdown clones (Fig. 4A). A similar pattern of
effect was observed at the mRNA level (Fig. 4C).
In SRB assays, ShTR3#3 cells showed signiﬁcantly reduced
basal growth compared with all 3 ShScr-expressing clones
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Growth inhibition following TR3
knockdown was accompanied by upregulation of basal levels
of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Fig. 4A). Notably,
ShTR3#3 cells showed the highest p21 levels among the TR3
knockdown clones, consistent with the highest level of basal
growth inhibition in these cells.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, the inhibitory effects
of 5 mmol/L cisplatin in ShScr clones in SRB assays were
reduced in all 3 TR3 knockdown clones, with greatest
inhibition observed in ShTR3#3 cells. Therefore, we selected
the combination of ShScr#1 and ShTR3#3 cells for further
analysis. We conﬁrmed that cisplatin resistance in TR3
knockdown cells was observed over a range of cisplatin
concentrations (2–10 mmol/L; Fig. 4D). Moreover, a major
contribution to this effect in ShTR3 cells was inhibition of
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced levels
of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 4E). We also

conﬁrmed that TR3 downregulation conferred resistance to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OVCAR3 cells, using 2 distinct TR3-targeting siRNAs (Fig. 4F). Reduced cytoplasmic
translocation of TR3 in ShTR3 and siTR3-transfected cells
was conﬁrmed by subcellular fractionation and immunoﬂuorescence (data not shown).
The inhibitory effects of mechanistically distinct cytotoxic
drugs, the DNA-damaging agent, doxorubicin, and the histone
deacetylase inhibitor, SAHA, were also inhibited by TR3 knockdown in SRB assays (Supplementary Fig. S7A). We conﬁrmed
that doxorubicin and SAHA both induced mitochondrial targeting of TR3 in OVCAR8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). These
ﬁndings indicate that the reduced growth inhibitory and
apoptotic effects following TR3 knockdown were not speciﬁc
to cisplatin.
We next examined the response of ShScr#1 and ShTR3#3
cells to cisplatin in vivo. As shown in Fig. 5A–C, 3 weeks'

treatment with cisplatin via intraperitoneal injection induced
pronounced reduction in size of tumors derived from ShScr
cells, an effect abrogated by approximately 52%  8% by TR3
knockdown. Basal growth of ShTR3 xenografts was reduced by
14%  5% compared with ShScr tumors, although this difference failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.081, Mann–
Whitney test). Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to quantify the number of apoptotic and proliferating
cells by staining for cleaved caspase-3 and Ki67, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 5D and F, the cisplatin-induced increase in
cleaved caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly abrogated in ShTR3 cells.
In contrast, the cisplatin-induced reduction in cells expressing
Ki67 was similar between ShTR3 and control ShScr cells (Fig.
5E and F). These results suggest that reduced cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in tumors with TR3 downregulation likely contributed more to cisplatin resistance than reduced growth-inhibitory effects.

TR3 overexpression sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro
As a large proportion of ovarian tumors retain high TR3
expression, which is associated with relative sensitivity to
platinum chemotherapy, we next determined whether increasing TR3 expression increased response to cisplatin. We selected SKOV3 cells for these studies because of their relatively low
endogenous TR3 protein expression (see Fig. 1A), which we
conﬁrmed in immunoﬂuorescence experiments (data not
shown). As shown in Fig. 6A, SKOV3 cells that were transiently
transfected with a TR3-myc/DDK (FLAG)-tagged expression
vector were sensitized to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We
conﬁrmed that the TR3-FLAG vector was targeted to the
mitochondria in cisplatin-treated cells by immunoﬂuorescence staining (Fig. 6B).
JNK and Akt mediate TR3 phosphorylation and nuclear
export in association with cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian
cancer cells
To investigate mechanisms linking nuclear export of TR3 to
cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells, we examined TR3
phosphorylation by JNK activation and Akt inhibition. It is
known that N-terminal serine phosphorylation by JNK and loss
of Akt-mediated phosphorylation on serine 351 are essential for

4766

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

nuclear export of TR3 (15). Furthermore, a less sustained JNK
activation in cisplatin-resistant A2780 CP20 cells compared
with PAR cells is observed following cisplatin treatment (34).
First, we showed JNK activation and AKT inhibition in
OVCAR8 cells compared with cisplatin-resistant NCI/ADRRES cells after 24-hour cisplatin treatment (Fig. 6C). Then, we
showed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments that OVCAR8
cells display increased levels of serine phosphorylation of TR3
following cisplatin treatment, an effect not observed in NCI/
ADR-RES cells (Fig. 6D). To directly test the role of JNK
activation in cisplatin sensitivity, we treated OVCAR8 cells
with the JNK-selective inhibitor SP600125 (35). When JNK was
inhibited, cytoplasmic translocation and mitochondrial targeting of TR3 was reduced (Fig. 6E and F); effects were associated
with reduced levels of cleaved PARP. Similar results were
observed in cisplatin-treated OVCAR3 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S8A and S8B).
Having established a role for JNK activation in cisplatin
sensitivity, we asked whether cisplatin resistance could be
overcome by the well-characterized JNK activator, anisomycin
(36). Because inhibition of Akt is also necessary for TR3 nuclear
export (15), we tested the effects of the Akt pathway inhibitor
wortmannin (37). Treatment with anisomycin or wortmannin
alone did not alter TR3 localization or apoptosis in cisplatin-

resistant NCI/ADR-RES cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). However, simultaneous treatment with wortmannin, anisomycin, and
cisplatin in NCI/ADR-RES cells as shown in Fig. 6G and H,
increased the number of cells with mitochondrial TR3 localization in association with apoptosis, and sensitized the cells to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Similar results were seen in A2780
CP20 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8C and S8D).

Discussion
A clinical challenge in the treatment of metastatic ovarian
cancer is the resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. In
this study, we show a role for TR3 in contributing to platinumresistance in ovarian cancer. First, we show that low nuclear
expression of TR3 is associated with platinum resistance and
decreased survival in a large subset of metastatic serous
ovarian cancers represented on a TMA we designed. Then,
we show a role for TR3 in mediating chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Finally, we identify
2 plausible mechanisms by which TR3 contributes to cisplatin
resistance in ovarian cancer by: (i) downregulation of expression and (ii) aberrant nuclear sequestration.
To date, no previous reports have related protein expression
of the TR3 nuclear orphan receptor in ovarian tumors to
clinical outcomes. In our TMA, a large subset of metastatic
ovarian serous tumors had low TR3 protein levels, which were
associated with reduced responses to platinum chemotherapy,
and decreased overall and PFS. TCGA data indicate that mRNA
expression is not signiﬁcantly different in platinum-resistant
and -sensitive tumors, and show no signiﬁcant association
between TR3 expression and survival indices (3). Although
limited by fewer cases, Yoshihara dataset reveals reduced PFS
with low TR3 mRNA levels (33). Moreover, our results are
consistent with previous reports of downregulated TR3 expression in other types of metastatic solid tumors (17, 20).
Targeting the proapoptotic effects of TR3 as a therapeutic
tool is emerging as an attractive strategy for cancer treatment
(4). In response to proapoptotic factors or direct agonists such
as derivatives of cytosporone B and C-DIM (8, 16, 38), the TR3
orphan nuclear receptor is implicated in mediating apoptosis
in cancer cells by at least three distinct mechanisms: (i)
nucleus-to-cytoplasmic translocation, resulting in cytochrome
c release through direct mitochondrial targeting of TR3 (5, 6, 8–
11); (ii) mechanisms independent of mitochondrial association
(7); and (iii) activation of TR3-mediated transcription (12–14).
Although TR3 has been associated with vitamin K2-induced
apoptosis in ovarian-derived teratocarcinoma Pa-1 cells (5), a
role for TR3 in mediating chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in
human ovarian cancer cells of epithelial origin has not been
previously described. Here, we have identiﬁed nuclear export
to the mitochondria as a major factor in determining cisplatin
response in epithelial ovarian cancer cells.
Cytoplasmic translocation of TR3 was observed in relatively
cisplatin-sensitive cells (OVCAR8, OVCAR3, and A2780 PAR),
but not in cisplatin-resistant NCI/ADR-RES or A2780 CP20
cells. We show that TR3 is directly targeted to the mitochondria in ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin and other
proapoptotic drugs, doxorubicin and the histone deacetylase

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibitor, SAHA. Moreover, several lines of evidence indicate
that TR3 localized to the mitochondria is directly implicated in
apoptosis induction. First, cytochrome c release was observed
in approximately 80% of cells expressing cytoplasmic TR3.
Second, inhibition of nuclear export of TR3 with leptomycin B
signiﬁcantly reduced the extent of cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
Third, shRNA- and siRNA-mediated downregulation of TR3
expression resulted in signiﬁcant resistance to the antitumor
effects of cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic drugs, accompanied by reduced levels of TR3 in the cytoplasm. While these
studies indicate a role for direct TR3-mediated activation of the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway, the fact that leptomycin B did not
completely inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis suggests that
TR3 may also be exerting proapoptotic effects through in the
nucleus. This result is consistent with the observed proapoptotic effects of the methylene-substituted diindolylmethane (CDIM) family of TR3 agonists in cancer cells in the absence of
cytoplasmic TR3 translocation(13, 38). To fully understand the
role of TR3 in ovarian cancer apoptosis, we will explore nuclear
TR3 proapoptotic effects in future studies.
We acknowledge that multiple alternative mechanisms of
cisplatin-induced apoptosis and platinum resistance have
been reported in cancer cells (39–44) that are TR3 independent. However, in this study, we have identiﬁed 2 mechanisms
by which deregulation of TR3 function contributes to cisplatin
resistance: downregulation of expression and aberrant nuclear
sequestration. We also provide evidence that these effects may
at least be partially overcome by TR3 overexpression or by
stimulating TR3 phosphorylation and nuclear export by JNK
activation and inhibition of Akt.
While reduced TR3 levels in advanced cancer may impair
response to chemotherapy as suggested by our data, a study in
breast cancer showed that downregulation of TR3 promotes
cell invasion and migration (17). Therefore, TR3 may play a
more complex role in ovarian cancer than simply as a putative
target of therapy. Determining whether TR3 downregulation in
ovarian cancer cells promotes other critical protumorigenic
cellular processes, such as tumor cell invasion and/or activation of oncogenic signaling pathways (19), will be the focus of
future studies. Adding to the complexity of the possible roles of
TR3 in ovarian cancer, we also showed that there was reduced
growth in TR3 knockdown cells. These ﬁndings suggest a
proproliferative role for TR3, which may have signiﬁcance in
some metastatic ovarian cancer cells and normal ovarian
epithelial cells expressing high levels of TR3. Such a cell-type
and context-dependent proproliferative role for TR3 would be
consistent with (i) the ability of mitogens to induce TR3 in the
absence of apoptosis (7) and (ii) observations in various solid
tumors, where TR3 is overexpressed in cancer cells compared
with normal epithelium (16–19).
In conclusion, we have shown that TR3 is an important
regulator of apoptosis and plays a role in mediating response to
cytotoxic chemotherapy such as cisplatin in subtypes of ovarian cancer. Further investigation into cell-type and contextdependent mechanisms is planned. Nevertheless, our results
suggest that targeting TR3 by activating its expression and
promoting its nuclear export are rational therapeutic strategies for overcoming cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.
