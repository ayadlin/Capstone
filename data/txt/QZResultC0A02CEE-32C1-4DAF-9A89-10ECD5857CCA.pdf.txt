BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical resection and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) are accepted treatments for single and oligometastatic cancer to the brain. To avoid the decline in neurocognitive function (NCF) linked to WBRT, the authors conducted a prospective, multicenter, phase 2 study to determine whether surgery and carmustine wafers (CW), while deferring WBRT, could preserve
NCF and achieve local control (LC). METHODS: NCF and LC were measured in 59 patients who underwent resection and received
CW for a single (83%) or dominant (oligometastatic, 2 to 3 lesions) metastasis and received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for tiny
nodules not treated with resection plus CW. Preservation of NCF was defined as an improvement or a decline 1 standard deviation
from baseline in 3 domains: memory, executive function, and fine motor skills, evaluated at 2-month intervals. RESULTS: Significant
improvements in executive function and memory occurred throughout the 1-year follow-up. Preservation or improvement of NCF
occurred in all 3 domains for the majority of patients at each of the 2-month intervals. NCF declined in only 1 patient. The chemowafers were well tolerated, and serious adverse events were reversible. There was local recurrence in 28% of the patients at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with brain metastases had improvements in their cognitive trajectory, especially memory and
executive function, after treatment with resection plus CW. The rate of LC (78%) was comparable to historic rates of surgery with
WBRT and superior to reports of WBRT alone. For patients who undergo resection for symptomatic or large-volume metastasis or for

INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases affect 25% to 45% of patients with cancer.1-3 The rising incidence of metastasis to the brain threatens to
limit gains made by new systemic treatments.4 Both the blood-tumor barrier and tumor-stromal interactions impede the
delivery of systemic drugs to tumors in the brain.3-5
Based on the trials of Patchell and colleagues,6,7 neurosurgical resection and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
are mainstays of current therapy.8-11 WBRT helps prevent local recurrence and new distant brain metastases,7,12-14 but it
fails to improve the duration of functional independence or overall survival.13,14 WBRT carries risks of neurocognitive
impairment, leukoencephalopathy, and brain atrophy.15-17 Thus, as patients with brain metastases live longer, increasing
concern regarding neurocognitive function (NCF) has led to a paradigm shift to defer WBRT and treat locally with surgery and=or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) while monitoring for distant relapses.12,14,18,19
To enhance drug delivery, biodegradable carmustine polymer wafers (Gliadel; Eisai, Inc., Woodcliff Lake, NJ) were
developed to be implanted into the surgical cavity of malignant gliomas.20-22 Preclinical, orthotopic models demonstrated
prolonged survival and local control (LC) when carmustine wafers were used to treat brain metastases.23,24 In the only
published clinical trial that used carmustine wafers to treat brain metastases, we demonstrated excellent LC when carmustine wafers were combined with resection and WBRT.25 Given the known NCF risks linked to WBRT,12,17-19 we

designed the current study to evaluate the LC rate with
resection and chemowafers while deferring WBRT. We
hypothesized that NCF would be preserved or improved
as we monitored the “cognitive trajectory” after surgery.26
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This prospective, single-arm, phase 2 trial
(NCT00525590) involved 12 US centers between December 2007 and December 2010. The institutional
review board at each site approved the protocol, following
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided informed consent. A data
safety committee monitored the study.
Eligible patients had 1 to 3 brain metastases, including patients with a single resectable metastasis or with 2
metastases that were resectable as 1 cavity (distance apart,
<1 cm); age >18 years; a Karnofsky performance status
(KPS) 70; and a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA)
classification of 1 (35%) or 2 (65%).1,27 The most common histology (41%) was nonsmall cell lung cancer.
Exclusion criteria included: small cell lung cancer, thyroid
cancer, lymphoma, germ cell cancer, or primary central
nervous system (CNS) tumor; prior cranial irradiation or
exposure to carmustine; leptomeningeal disease; surgically
targeted metastasis in brainstem or posterior fossa; pregnancy; unstable medical or psychiatric status; and receipt
of investigational drugs or bevacizumab within 30 days or
of anticoagulants within 7 days of entry.
Initially, the protocol included only patients with a
single cerebral metastasis, based on the assumption that
half of all metastases are single and, thus, are potentially
treatable by surgical resection.6 However, with modern
high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans, additional asymptomatic micrometastases that are
amenable to radiosurgery can be detected in up to 40%
of patients.28 Therefore, the protocol was amended to
include patients who had 1 to 3 MRI-detectable metastases for whom surgery was indicated for a dominant or
symptomatic tumor, and SRS was an option for all
remaining lesions. WBRT was withheld until patients
developed recurrent disease.
All patients underwent resection of a dominant or
single metastasis. Surgery was regarded as the best treatment option considering 1 or more of the following criteria: 1) tumor volume, 2) symptoms from mass effect or
edema, or 3) need for histologic diagnosis. Advanced surgical techniques—including image guidance, microsurgery, tractography, and brain mapping—achieved gross
total resection while minimizing the risk to surrounding
brain (Fig. 1).

After metastasis resection and histologic confirmation by frozen section, 1 to 8 carmustine wafers were used
to line the tumor cavity. Water-tight dural closure, known
to decrease complications,25 was used routinely. Ventricular openings <1 cm2 were sealed with resorbable hemostatic material.21 Chemowafers were avoided in the
subarachnoid space, especially if the neurosurgeon
encountered a major cerebral artery or infiltration of tumor. Corticosteroids and anticonvulsants were prescribed
judiciously by the treating physician.21,25
Within 14 days before surgery, patients underwent
baseline assessment, including history, physical examination, MRI, NCF, activities of daily living (ADL), KPS,
and RPA classification.27 A list of concurrent medications
was maintained. An MRI was obtained within 48 hours
after surgery; then, follow-up MRI, NCF, ADL, KPS,
RPA classification, and toxicity assessments were obtained
at months 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Patients were followed for 12
months unless there was evidence of treatment failure (eg,
local recurrence), neurologic decline because of CNS metastases, withdrawal from the study, or death.
The NCF assessment comprised 3 domains: 1)
memory using the revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test,
2) executive function using the Controlled Oral Word
Association and Trailmaking Test B, and 3) fine motor
coordination using the pegboard dominant and nondominant hand tests.29,30
Postsurgical imaging studies were reviewed for evidence of CNS recurrence.25 Local recurrences were
defined as within 2 cm of the initial resection cavity. Distant CNS recurrences were defined as any of the following: >2 cm from the initial surgical site; or the
contralateral side; or in the posterior fossa, spinal cord,
or cerebrospinal fluid (carcinomatous meningitis).
Adverse events (AEs) were graded for severity (mild,
moderate, severe, or fatal) and attribution (unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related to CW use). Toxicities were graded using National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0.25
The trial design was based on statistical assumptions:
a 35% rate of neurocognitive decline within 12 months, a
20% rate of local recurrence within 12 months, and a
15% drop-out rate. Accordingly, 50 to 58 patients were
required for a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI).
NCF endpoints included standardized score changes
(from baseline) for each visit, including time and severity
of neurocognitive change. Each NCF domain had an average standardized Z-score, and changes from each patient’s
own baseline were analyzed using the t test for paired data
(with 95% CIs). Preservation of NCF was defined as a

decrease of 1 standard deviation (SD), any improvement, or no change (0 SD); and worsening was defined as
a decrease >1 SD. Deterioration in NCF was defined as
deterioration from baseline in at least 2 domains. For each
domain, deterioration occurred if a Z-score average
decreased from baseline by 3 SD on 2 consecutive visits
or at the last follow-up visit. For a missing NCF evaluation, if the reason was “neurologic,” then a score of 25.00
was imputed.
Other endpoints included the rates of local and distal
tumor recurrence; the time to recurrence; and the correlation of recurrence with mass effect, cognitive functioning,
and clinical symptoms. The time to recurrence was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.31 Univariate and
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models for the time
to local, distant, and overall recurrence were produced
using 11 predictive factors (baseline tumor volume, age,
RPA classification, KPS, NCF score, resected tumor volume, number of implanted wafers, number of metastatic
tumors, primary cancer type, and radiation sensitivity).
RESULTS
Eighty-two patients were screened, 69 were enrolled, and
59 received treatment (Fig. 2, Table 1). Patients were fol3832

lowed for a median of 7.7 months. Fourteen of 59
patients (24%) completed the 12-month assessment period; 5 (36%) initially had an RPA classification of 1, and
9 (64%) initially had an RPA classification of 2. Five
patients were excluded from efficacy analyses because of
protocol violations after wafer implantation.
Preservation or improvement of NCF was observed
in all 3 domains for the majority of patients throughout
the study (month 2, 26 of 46 patients [57%]; month 4, 24
of 37 patients [65%]; month 6, 17 of 26 patients [65%];
month 9, 14 of 22 patients [64%]; and month 12, 9 of 14
patients [64%]). In 1 patient (2%), NCF deterioration
was observed in the fine motor coordination domain at
months 2 and 4 and in the memory domain at month 4
(last follow-up visit).
For the individual domains, the cumulative rates of
preservation and worsening of NCF were determined. In
the memory domain, 37 of 54 patients (69%) had preservation of NCF (including 26 of 54 patients [48%] who
had improvement), 8 of 54 patients (15%) had worsening
NCF, and 9 patients were not assessed. In the executive
function domain, 39 of 54 patients (72%) had preservation of NCF (including 23 of 54 patients [43%] who had
improvement), 4 of 54 patients (7%) had worsening

NCF, and 11 patients were not assessed. In the fine motor
coordination domain, 34 of 54 patients (63%) had preservation of NCF (including 27 of 54 patients [50%] who
had improvement), 11 of 54 patients (20%) had worsening NCF, and 9 patients were not assessed. Mean changes
in Z-scores are provided in Figure 3.
Fifty of our 54 patients had postbaseline MRI assessments. Local recurrences (Fig. 4A) developed in 14 of 50
evaluable patients (28%). The recurrence rate varied with
histology: patients with melanoma had the lowest recurrence rate (7%; 1 of 15 patients), those with nonsmall cell
lung cancer had a moderate rate (24%; 5 of 21 patients),
and patients with breast cancer had the highest rate (57%;
4 of 7 patients). These differences were not statistically
significant. Univariate predictors of the time to local recurrence were: 1) baseline total tumor volume (hazard ratio [HR], 1.043; P 5 .009) and 2) the number of wafers
implanted (HR, 1.366; P 5 .040), which is also a function
of tumor volume. Significant multivariate predictors of
Cancer

the time to local recurrence were: 1) baseline total tumor
volume (HR, 1.095; P 5 .001), 2) primary cancer status
(previously diagnosed and receiving systemic chemotherapy vs newly diagnosed and no prior therapy; HR,
22.506; P 5 .013), 3) baseline KPS (HR, 0.922;
P 5 .031), and 4) baseline NCF score (HR, 1.534;
P 5 .002).
Distant recurrences (Fig. 4B) developed in 24 of 50
patients (48%) and consisted of diverse histologies,
including nonsmall cell lung cancer (33%; 7 of 21
patients), breast cancer (57%; 4 of 7 patients), and melanoma (53%; 8 of 15 patients). Over half of the distant
recurrences (17 of 24 recurrences) developed by month 4.
Recurrences in these patients were treated with SRS or
WBRT, and they achieved favorable oncologic control
without neurologic-related death.
The median number of wafers inserted was 5 (range,
1.5-8.0 wafers), corresponding to a dose of 38.5 mg carmustine. Eight patients with large tumors received the

maximum dose of 8 wafers (61.6 mg carmustine). Six
patients had the wafers removed because of a serious AE
(SAE); in 2 of those patients, the investigator believed that
the SAE was possibly, or probably, related to the chemowafers, and these patients remained in the study.
The AEs reflected the morbidity of the primary cancer and the side effects of systemic therapy (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, paraneoplastic syndromes, etc)
(Table 2). SAEs (including deaths) were reported for 40 of
59 patients. Six patients had a total of 10 SAEs that were
considered possibly related to the chemowafers (Table 3).
None were fatal, and all resolved with appropriate surgical
or medical management; 2 SAEs (a chemowafer-related
infection and a wound infection) required removal of the
wafers, and 1 SAE (the aforementioned chemowaferrelated infection) had permanent sequelae. Nine patients
died during the study, including 1 neurologic death and 8
deaths related to the extracranial, primary cancer.

developing tailored therapies to enhance functional well

that: 1) the “cognitive trajectory” after craniotomy is one
of preserved or improved NCF for the majority of
patients, and 2) NCF can be improved or preserved while
achieving acceptable rates of LC with a strategy of resection plus chemowafer, while deferring WBRT. Such an

approach may be particularly appropriate when surgery is
clinically indicated for a larger tumor (2-3 cm in greatest
dimension), a symptomatic metastasis, or a lesion requiring tissue diagnosis.37
Brain metastases represent an increasing health priority because of the prolonged survival of cancer patients,
the inability of some novel cancer therapies to reach the
CNS, and enhanced detection using advanced neuroimaging.2,28 Thus, as the outlook for meaningful survival
has increased with improved systemic therapy, the goals of
brain metastasis therapy are shifting from short-term palliation to prolonged control of intracerebral tumor
growth while maintaining=improving neurologic and
functional status and avoiding the potential toxicity of
WBRT.12,18,19,32,33,37,38 Indeed, results from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) 22952-26001 trial (surgery=SRS then WBRT
or surveillance) support withholding the upfront use of
WBRT, thereby improving functional outcomes, without
compromising survival.12,32

The current results suggest that deferring WBRT
while using upfront surgery and carmustine wafers can
preserve NCF and provide acceptable local cancer control
rates, similar to surgery and WBRT.7,12 We observed a
global NCF decline in only 1 patient (2%), which is
markedly superior to WBRT.12,29,30,32 NCF was preserved in all 3 domains in 65% of patients. In addition,
NCF improvements were observed in >40% of patients
for each individual domain, especially executive function
and memory. The improvement may be caused by a
reduction of perilesional vasogenic edema or the neuroplasticity of white matter fiber tracts. These findings

compare favorably to a recent study of SRS with=without
WBRT, in which memory and learning declined in 24%
of patients who underwent SRS alone and in 52% of those
who underwent SRS with WBRT.30
For patients with brain metastases, NCF scores correlate with tumor volume and predict survival32; >90%
of patients with brain metastases demonstrate impairment
of 1 neurocognitive tests at baseline,32,36 which can be
improved with surgery.37 The current study demonstrates
a sustained improvement in NCF after surgery and indicates that carmustine chemowafers do not adversely affect
NCF.
The 28% local recurrence rate reported here is comparable to the previously reported rates for SRS alone32
and for surgery with WBRT7 and is generally superior to
the rates reported from studies of surgery alone (without
wafer).7,32 The addition of WBRT to SRS increases LC
rates13,32 up to 97% for low-volume metastases.39 Previously, WBRT combined with surgery plus chemowafers
produced complete (100%) LC.25 Because local recurrence rates are a function of both tumor volume and surgical technique,40,41 the extent to which local efficacy is
attributable to advances in neurosurgical technology40,41
versus the effect of the carmustine wafer42 cannot be
determined without a controlled comparative trial.
There were 9 deaths during the 12-month follow-up
period, and 5 of those deaths occurred >300 days after
surgery. It is noteworthy that only 1 patient (2%) died
because of neurologic disease progression. In the EORTC
study of surgery=SRS plus WBRT, neurologic death
occurred in 28% of patients who received WBRT compared with 44% of patients who were managed with surveillance, although overall survival was unchanged.32 The
low neurologic mortality rate compares favorably with
patients who underwent SRS alone, reported as 12%.33
The toxicity and AEs reported here are largely
because of the systemic cancer and concurrent therapies.
Because the chemowafers release carmustine locally, there

is no detectable level of chemotherapy in the bloodstream,
avoiding many of the systemic toxicities.20-22 It is known
that chemowafers carry neurosurgical risks of cerebral
edema, wound dehiscence, or seizures,20,21 which are
reduced by the judicious use of steroids, water-tight dural
closures, and anticonvulsant medications.20,21,25 In our
prior study of chemowafers, surgery, and WBRT, we
observed seizures in 2 patients (8%), but no other
toxicities.25
The current study has limitations. First, this was not
a randomized, controlled trial. The specific benefits=toxicities of surgery, chemotherapy, SRS, and avoidance of WBRT were compared with historic controls.
Placebo-controlled trials using chemowafers, which have
proven efficacy in high-grade gliomas,20,22 are problematic to design for single and oligometastatic brain cancer,
for which there are multiple existing options (eg, surgery
alone, SRS alone, resection plus SRS, resection plus
WBRT) and deeply held biases.18 Second, single-arm
studies of NCF in patients with brain metastases are difficult to interpret because of numerous confounding variables, including selection bias.43 In the current study, there
was a selection bias, because our patients had an RPA classification of 1 or 2, a favorable KPS, and a prognosis that
favored undergoing craniotomy. Nevertheless, each
patient acted as their own control, so an immediate postoperative and sustained improvement in NCF is noteworthy and novel. Current approaches to the treatment of
brain metastases must balance local and distant control in
the CNS with neurocognitive preservation. The current
study demonstrates that the strategy of neurosurgical
resection plus chemowafers provides local cancer control
comparable to that provided by radiation therapy. Furthermore, the results indicate a benefit in NCF from withholding WBRT and treating limited brain metastases in a
targeted manner. The range of options for patients with
brain metastases also will be increased as the novel,
pathway-specific, targeted agents44 are evaluated. The

preserved and often improved NCF observed using resection and local carmustine wafers, as well as the known
pharmacokinetics of carmustine,20,21,42 suggest that this
strategy can be used without injury to white matter fiber
tracts that affect NCF.45
