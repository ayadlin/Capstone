ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.
While surgery remains the mainstay of treatment in early stage CRC, chemotherapy
is usually given to prolong the overall survival and improve the quality of life for
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). But drug resistance is one of the major hurdles
of mCRC treatment, and the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. In this
study, we show that, compared with parental cells, RhoA is up-regulated in irinotecan
(CPT-11)-resistant CRC cells. Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA in drug resistant cells, at
least partially, rescues the resistance against irinotecan and increases the sensitivity
to other chemotherapeutic drug by inhibiting expression of MDR1, MRP1and GSTP1,
promotes apoptosis by suppressing the expression of BCL-XL and Bcl-2 and increasing
Bax expression, and significantly decreases side population cells. Our results suggest
that, in addition to survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion, cell cycle and gene
transcription, RhoA is also involved in chemoresistance by regulating the expression
of membrane transporter and apoptosis protein in colorectal cancer. They raise an
interesting possibility that the expression of RhoA may indicate a poor prognosis due
to the high probability to therapy resistance and, on the other hand, inhibition of RhoA
activity and function may overcome chemoresistance and improve the effectiveness
of clinical treatment of CRC.

INTRODUCTION

hindered. The mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer
cells are complicated and main mechanisms include (1)
increased drug efflux mediated by membrane transport
proteins such as ABC transport proteins family members
p-glycoprotein (p-gp), multidrug resistance-associated
protein (MRP), and breast cancer resistance protein
(BCRP/ABCG2) [5, 6, 12]; (2) reduction in cell apoptosis
mediated by bcl-2 family [7–9], NF-kB, and p53 [10];
and (3) other drug resistance mechanisms mediated by
topoisomerase and glutathione S-transferase (GST). The
reduction of topoisomerase activity leads to decreased
affinity of topoisomerase with its target cells, which
rendering target cells resistant to chemotherapy [11].
Rho GTPases family is an important intracellular
signaling module and plays a key role in cell survival,
proliferation, adhesion, cell cycle, gene transcription

Colorectal cancer is one of the most malignant
cancers of digestive system, and its morbidity is increasing
with years. The main treatment at present is surgeryplus chemotherapy-based comprehensive therapy.
Irinotecan is one of common chemotherapeutic drugs
for colorectal cancer, which inhibits DNA synthesis of
cancer cells through inhibition of Topo I activity [1–3].
At present, FOLFIRI regimen, including CPT-11, 5-Fu
and leucovorin, was considered as one of the standard
first line or second line treatment of mCRC [4]. However,
most patients become resistant to chemotherapy after
a couple of cycles, leading to the failure of treatment.
Therefore, chemoresistance is a bottleneck constraint of
current therapies and the effectiveness has been seriously

and other aspects of cell activities. While a subset of
Rho GTPases are constitutively active, the majority
of Rho family members act as molecular switches,
cycling between the active, GTP-bound form and the
inactive, GDP-bound form that are controlled by guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating
proteins (GAPs) and GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs)
[13]. As a primary Rho GTPase, RhoA is involved in
multiple aspects of tumor development and progression,
such as proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis,
and apoptosis [14, 15]. However, whether and how RhoA
regulates drug resistance in colorectal cancer are poorly
understood.
CPT-11 is one of the key chemotherapy agents for
mCRC and resistance to CPT-11 is a major reason for the
treatment failure. We established the CPT-11-resistant
cells by exposure to a low dose of CPT-11 in culture media
for 12 months, and preliminary results of comparative
proteomic analysis of CPT-11-resistant CRC cells and
parental cells show that irinotecan resistance is related
to changes in several pathways such as cell proliferation/
differentiation, cell apoptosis, and electron transport/
redox regulation [16, 17]. In this study, we have explored
the role of RhoA on CPT-11 resistance and underlying
molecular mechanisms. Our study has provided a novel
insight into the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance
in colorectal cancer, and suggested that targeting RhoA
signaling might improve the effectiveness of clinical
treatment of colorectal cancer.

drug resistance index of the cells to oxaliplatin (L-OHP),
cisplatin(DDP), Irinotecan (CPT-11), paclitaxel (PTX),
5-FU, epirubicin (EPI), and Etoposide (VP-16), by
in vitro drug sensitivity assay. As shown in Table 1,
the IC50 of all of the 7 chemotherapy drugs in CPT11-resistant CRC cells was significantly increased
compared to that in parental cells. However, the IC50
was significantly decreased upon transfection of si-RhoA
(p < 0.05). These data suggest that inhibition of RhoA
expression in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells, at least partially,
overcomes chemoresistance of CRC.

Inhibition of RhoA suppresses the expression
of P-gp, MRP1 and GSTP1 in CPT-11-resistant
CRC cells
To explore the mechanisms underlying RhoAregulated chemoreistance, Western blot was performed
to determine the expression of p-glycoprotein(P-gp) and
multidrug resistance-associated protein 1(MRP1), two
membrane transport proteins known to mediate drug
efflux, in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells and parental cells.
As expected, P-gp and MRP1 were up-regulated in CPT11-resistant CRC cells (Figure 2). Next, to test whether
P-gp and MRP1 are regulated by RhoA, SW620/CPT-11
and LoVo/CPT-11 cells were transfected with si-RhoA or
control, and expression of P-gp and MRP1 were examined
48 hours after transfection. Interestingly, inhibition of
RhoA by si-RhoA suppressed P-gp (Figure 2A–2C) and
MRP1(Figure 2A–2C) expression in CPT-11-resistant
CRC cells.
In addition to membrane transporting proteins,
glutathione S-transferase(GST) is also involved in drug
resistance [18]. The expression of GSTP1, an important
member of GST family, was determined by Western blot
in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells and parental cells. As
shown in Figure 2, GSTP1 was up-regulated in CPT-11resistant CRC cells and inhibition of RhoA by si-RhoA
suppressed GSTP1 expression (Figure 2A–2C). These data
suggest that both of membrane transport proteins and GST
are regulated by RhoA, which, at least partially, contribute
to CPT-11 resistance of CRC cells.

RESULTS
RhoA expression is increased significantly in
CPT-11-resistant CRC cells
To determine if RhoA is involved in chemoresistance
in colorectal cancer, we first examined the expression of
RhoA in CPT-11-resistant colorectal cancer cells (SW620/
CPT-11 and LoVo/CPT-11) and parental cells. Total
mRNAs and proteins of SW620/CPT-11, LoVo/CPT-11
and its parental cells were extracted and the expression
of RhoA mRNA and protein were analyzed by qRT-PCR
and Western blot, respectively. The results showed that
RhoA mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in
SW620/CPT-11 and LoVo/CPT-11 than in parental cells
(Figure 1). These results suggest a possible relationship
between RhoA and chemoresistance in CRC.

Inhibition of RhoA induces apoptosis in CPT-11resistant CRC cells
To further understand the mechanisms of RhoA in the
regulation of chemoresistance of CRC cells, we investigated
the effects of RhoA on apoptosis in CPT-11-resistant CRC
cells, as evasion of apoptosis is a crucial event during the
process of chemoresistance. We found that, compared
with parental cells, CPT-11-resistant CRC cells showed
a significant decrease in apoptosis rate, as determined
by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining (Figure 3A–3C),
whereas inhibition of RhoA by si-RhoA resulted in a
significant increase in apoptosis rate in CPT-11-resistant

Inhibition of RhoA expression, at least partially,
rescues CPT-11 chemoresistance of CRC cells
To examine if the increased RhoA expression is
important for chemoresistance of CRC, we transfected
SW620/CPT-11, LoVo/CPT-11 and parental cells with
siRNA targeting RhoA coding sequences (si-RhoA) and
control siRNA oligo (si-control), and then examined

CRC cells (Figure 3A–3C). Similar results were obtained
by TUNEL assay (Figure 4A–4C). These results suggest
that inhibition of RhoA induces apoptosis in CPT-11resistant CRC cells.
To characterize the mechanistic role of RhoA in
apoptosis in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells, Western blot
was performed to determine the protein expression of
bcl2 family members in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells and
parental cells. As shown in Figure 5, pro-apoptotic bax
was down-regulated, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl and Bcl2
were up-regulated in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells. To
determine whether bax, Bcl-xl and Bcl2 are regulated
by RhoA, SW620/CPT-11 and LoVo/CPT-11 cells were
transfected with si-RhoA, and expression of bax, Bcl-xl,
and Bcl2 were examined by Western blot 48 hours after
transfection. Interestingly, inhibition of RhoA by siRhoA suppressed the expression of Bcl-xl and Bcl2, and
promoted the expression of bax in CPT-11-resistant CRC
cells (Figure 5A–5C). These results suggest that CPT-11
chemoresistance of CRC cells could be attributed to the

decreased apoptosis that is regulated by RhoA through
regulating Bcl-2 signaling.

Inhibition of RhoA decreases the proportion of
SP cells in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells
Several studies have demonstrated that isolated side
population (SP) cells from solid tumors exhibit cancer
stem cell-like properties, and are responsible for drug
resistance during chemotherapy and tumor recurrence [19].
To investigate the role of SP cells in CPT-11 resistance of
CRC cells, and the role of RhoA in SP cells in CPT-11resistant CRC cells, we detected the proportion of SP cells
using the Hoechst/33342 dye exclusion technique in CPT11-resistant CRC cells and parental cells. Compared with
parental cells, the proportion of SP cells were increased
significantly in both of the CPT-11-resistant CRC cells
(SW620-CPT11,LoVo-CPT11) (p < 0.05, Figure 6A–6C),
whereas suppression of RhoA led to a drastic decrease
of SP cells in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells (p < 0.05,

Figure 6A–6C). These data suggest that RhoA-induced SP
cells contribute to drug resistance of CRC cells.

However, the role of RhoA in chemoresistance is poorly
defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of
RhoA on CPT-11 resistance and underlying molecular
mechanisms in detail. The results suggest that increased
expression of RhoA promotes resistance to irinotecan by
regulating membrane transporter and apoptosis signaling
in CPT-11-resistanct CRC cells. Our findings are in
line with that by Carloni V who has shown that RhoA
is involved in cell fusion and causes the appearance of
cells resistant to both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in
a metastatic model of colon carcinoma [28].Thus, the
expression of RhoA may indicate a poor prognosis due to
the high probability to therapy resistance.

DISCUSSION
CRC is a major cause of mortality and morbidity
worldwide [1]. For the advanced CRC, chemotherapy is
recommended as a major treatment. But drug resistance
highly limits therapeutic options and its molecular
mechanism needs to be understood urgently. As a key
member of the Rho GTPase family, RhoA is known to be
involved in proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis,
and angiogenesis, in several types of cancers [13–15].

ABC transporters transport a wide range of
substrates including metabolic products, nutrients, lipids,
and drugs across extracellular and intracellular membranes.
ABC transporters are well-known to be associated with

chemoresistance. Expression of various ABC transporters
is increased following chemotherapy, causing a reduction
in the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapy
drugs, and impacting on mCRC survival [12].

In support, our study found increased expression of
ABC transporters, MRP1 and P-gp, in CPT-11-resistant
CRC cells. Importantly, suppression of RhoA in CPT-11resistant CRC cells leads to decreased expression of MRP1
and P-gp. We propose that inhibition of RhoA could rescue
chemoresistance, at least partially, by dampening ABC
transporter expression in CRC cells.
In addition to increased ABC transporters, we
have further found that suppression of apoptosis is
another important mechanism of drug resistance of CRC
and that RhoA critically inhibits apoptosis in CPT-11resistant CRC. Studies have shown that Bcl-2 and Bax
play important roles in mediating drug-induced apoptosis
and drug resistance in various tumor cells, including
hepatocellular carcinoma, bladder, lung and ovarian
cancer [20–23]. Here we show that RhoA inhibits druginduced apoptosis by impacting on Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bax.
Growing evidences support the notion that cancer is
a disease driven by cancel stem cells that are responsible
for tumor initiation, growth, metastasis, therapy resistance,
relapse, and poor prognosis [24–27]. Several studies
have demonstrated that the isolated side population (SP)
cells from solid tumors exhibit cancer stem cell-like
properties, and are responsible for drug resistance during

chemotherapy and tumor recurrence [24–27]. In the
current study, we have found that SP cells are increased
in CPT-11-resistant CRC cells and suppression of RhoA
leads to a sharp decrease of SP cells. It indicates that, in
addition to membrane transport proteins and survival,
cancer stem cells/SP cells are also regulated by RhoA and
contribute to drug resistance of CRC.
In conclusion, our study shows that RhoA is
involved in chemoresistance of CRC by regulating the
expression of membrane transporters, apoptotic proteins
and the proportion of SP cells. Thus, the expression
of RhoA may indicate a poor prognosis due to the high
probability to therapy resistance and, on the other hand,
chemoresistance can be compromised through interfering
RhoA expression.
