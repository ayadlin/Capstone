BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with ixabepilone and capecitabine (cape) is approved for use in patients with
locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer that is resistant to treatment with anthracyclines or taxanes. The current
study evaluated the trade-off between quality and quantity of life using quality-adjusted time without symptoms or
toxicity (Q-TWiST) outcomes. METHODS: Within the trial, 752 women were randomly assigned to receive either the
combination of ixabepilone and cape (once every 21 days) or cape alone (on days 1-14). The area under the survival
curve was partitioned into 3 health states: toxicity (TOX), time without symptoms of disease progression or toxicity,
and recurrence (relapse [REL]). The mean time in each health state was weighted by a range of utilities and summed
to estimate quality-adjusted survival (QAS). Patient-reported outcomes were also evaluated using the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Breast Symptom Index (FBSI). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference
between groups with regard to change from baseline FBSI scores favoring the cape group was observed (P ¼
.0002), but no differences were observed after adjusting for deaths in the analysis. All combinations of utilities for
REL and TOX resulted in an observed difference in QAS favoring combination therapy. Differences were found to be
statistically significant for comparisons, with higher tolerance for TOX. QAS was found to be greater for the combination therapy group (42.2 weeks vs 38.4 weeks), assuming the base case scenario of utility equal to 0.5 for both TOX
and REL (P ¼ .0227). CONCLUSIONS: The Q-TWiST analysis supports a positive benefit-risk ratio for the combination
of ixabepilone plus cape in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer that is refractory to anthracyclines
and taxanes versus cape alone, despite the potential for added toxicities with combination therapy. Cancer

Quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes are important to more fully understand the effects of new chemotherapy regimens,
especially when there are various patient benefits and risks associated with the new oncology treatments.1-3 Treatments
that improve both the QOL and survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are needed.4,5 QOL assessments
have increased value in clinical trials, in which survival benefits between treatments are expected to be small.5-9 QOL endpoints have become as important as other traditional endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) or tumor response
in oncology clinical trials.8,10
Given the benefits in delayed disease progression and the risks associated with increased toxicity, it is important to
compare subjective treatment risks and benefits using a single outcome metric that incorporates QOL outcomes. The
quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) method was originally developed by Gelber et al to evaluate outcomes in breast cancer clinical trials and provides an estimate of both the quality and quantity of survival time

using a single metric.11,12 The Q-TWiST analysis compares the outcomes related to the disease and its treatment
and also includes QOL considerations from the patient’s
perspective. Assessments such as PFS only measure the
period between clinical events, and thus fail to consider
the value of time without symptoms or toxicity to the
patient. The Q-TWiST method assigns preference
weights to clinically relevant health states such as treatment toxicity, PFS, or disease progression that may affect
QOL13-15 to better evaluate the trade-off between adverse
side effects because of increased toxicity and improved
response. Q-TWiST methods have been used to evaluate
the benefits of chemotherapy on disease recurrence and
survival in women with breast cancer.14,16,17 The output
of the Q-TWiST analysis, quality-adjusted survival
(QAS), represents a single metric that combines both efficacy and safety assessments and provides a meaningful
outcome for clinicians and their patients.
A recent study (CA163-046) found that ixabepilone
(BMS-247550) combined with capecitabine (cape)
resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with cape monotherapy (median PFS, 5.85 months vs 4.17 months;
hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [P ¼ .0003]) in women with
MBC who were previously treated with anthracyclines
and taxane.18 A statistically significant improvement in
overall survival (OS) was not observed (12.9 months vs
11.1 months; HR, 0.9 [P ¼ .1936]). Treatment-related
toxicities were more common with combination therapy
compared with cape monotherapy, with the majority of
adverse events (AEs) reported as being mild to moderate.
These clinical efficacy and safety analyses are the focus of
prior publications.18,19 A second randomized phase 3
study (CA163-048) with the same investigational drugs
and study design was performed concurrently with clinical
trial CA163-046.19 This study confirmed a similar safety
profile in both treatment arms.
QOL data were collected within the CA163-046
study using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-Breast Symptom Index (FBSI). We completed a
Q-TWiST analysis to evaluate the trade-off between clinical benefits and treatment-related toxicities associated
with ixabepilone and cape combination therapy versus
cape monotherapy. The objectives of the current study
were to 1) evaluate the QOL outcomes of the combination of ixabepilone and cape versus cape monotherapy
with the FBSI; and 2) compare the Q-TWiST outcomes
of combination therapy with ixabepilone and cape versus
cape monotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Design
Clinical trial data used in this current analysis were previously published.18 Briefly, the clinical trial was an international, randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial
of ixabepilone in combination with cape or cape alone
(monotherapy) in patients with progressive metastatic or
locally advanced breast cancer who were previously treated
with an anthracycline or a taxane. In the clinical trial, 752
women aged 18 years were randomized at 160 sites in
22 countries beginning on September 4, 2003 until January 26, 2006 to 1 of the 2 treatment arms: 1) ixabepilone
at a dose of 40 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 of each cycle only, plus oral cape at
a dose of 1000 mg/m2 administered twice daily (2000
mg/m2 daily dose), on days 1 to 14 every 21 days; or 2)
cape at a dose of 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (2500 mg/m2
daily dose) on days 1 to 14 every 21 days.
The primary endpoint of PFS was based on independently reviewed tumor assessments using modified
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
During treatment, patients in both groups were assessed
every 6 weeks until disease progression. Patients who discontinued treatment were assessed every 6 weeks until 24
weeks from randomization, and then every 3 months until
disease progression.
Health Outcome Measure
The FBSI was used to examine the effect of treatment on
patient symptoms.20 The FBSI covers relevant symptoms
associated with MBC. The minimal important difference
(MID) for the FBSI was determined to be 2 to 3 points20;
we selected 2.5 as the MID for the current study. All study
patients completed the FBSI at screening, before each
chemotherapy cycle, and at the first post-study follow-up.
The FBSI was a secondary endpoint in this clinical trial.
Q-TWiST Definitions
After the initiation of treatment, the toxicity state was
defined as the time spent with CTCAE grade 3/4 AEs
before disease progression (TOX).18 The time spent with
AEs was summed for each patient and a day with multiple
events was only counted once. TOX was determined as
time spent with AEs, regardless of when the events
occurred. However, any AEs that occurred after disease
progression were excluded from the analysis.
The period of time without symptoms or toxicity
before the progression of disease (TWiST) was determined. PFS was based on RECIST and patients who died

without a reported prior disease progression were considered to have developed progression on their date of death.
Patients who failed to receive study treatment or did not
have a radiological assessment were censored on the date
of randomization.
The period of time after disease progression and
ending with death or censoring was referred to as the progression state (relapse [REL]). To simultaneously evaluate
both the quantity and quality of life using a single metric,
a range of utility scores was assigned to the TOX and REL
health states.
A threshold utility analysis was performed to measure treatment comparisons across all combinations of
utility scores, in which TWiST is used as a reference state
and is assumed to have a utility equal to 1. TWiST is the
best possible health state that can be experienced by a
patient with MBC. The TOX and REL states were
assigned various weights between 0 and 1. The base case
considered a utility score of 0.5 each.
Statistical Analysis
Comparison of FBSI scores

The primary analysis used to compare changes in
FBSI scores was conducted using the Wei-Lachin test for
multivariate analysis.21 Data from all time points were
considered for this analysis. Plots of the mean FBSI
changes from baseline over time were presented for the
first 24 weeks.
To assess the impact of missing data because of disease progression and death, additional analyses of mean
changes from baseline were conducted with adjustment
for death. To account for this informative missingness
and to evaluate the impact of disease progression on FBSI
scores, a conservative imputation approach was implemented in which patients who died before week 24 were
assigned a FBSI score of 0 after their death.22,23

mean durations of TWiST and REL were calculated as
follows:
TWiST ¼ PFS  TOX; and
REL ¼ OS  PFS,
in which TOX, TWiST, and REL represent health
state durations. In the current analysis, TOX included
grade 3/4 AEs only.
The QAS was obtained by assigning utility scores to
each health state and summing the weighted averages.
The Q-TWiST for each treatment group was calculated as
follows:
Q-TWiST ¼ (uTOX  TOX) þ TWiST þ (uREL 
REL), in which TOX, TWiST, and REL represent the
mean health state durations and uTOX and uREL denote
the utility weights (coefficients) for TOX and REL.
The Q-TWiST analyses were completed for the
total trial sample and for prespecified poor-prognosis
groups. The poor-prognosis subgroups included patients
with the triple negative phenotype (patients with tumors
that did not express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER-2], estrogen receptor, or progesterone receptor), symptomatic patients with a Karnofsky
performance status (KPS) of 70 to 80, and post-adjuvant
rapid recurrence (recurrence < 12 months after adjuvant
therapy with an anthracycline and taxane).

Q-TWiST analysis

RESULTS
Demographic and disease characteristics were found to be
similar across treatment groups (Table 1). Patients with
MBC were randomly assigned to receive either combination therapy with ixabepilone and cape (n ¼ 375) or cape
monotherapy (n ¼ 377). Approximately 88% of patients
were aged  65 years and approximately 65% had a KPS
score of  90. Extensive metastases of  3 disease sites
were prevalent in 65% of patients. The majority of
patients (84%) had visceral disease involving the liver
and/or lung.

For the Q-TWiST analysis, the estimated mean
durations of each health state were generated using the
Kaplan-Meier product limit method.24 P values were estimated based on the normal approximation method, in
which mean treatment differences are estimated from the
Kaplan-Meier analysis and variance is estimated using
bootstrap methodology.25 The following outcomes were
estimated: TOX is the time with AEs before disease progression, the period of time from randomization to disease
progression or death (ie, PFS), and time from randomization to death from any cause (overall survival [OS]). The

Clinical Outcomes
Combination therapy resulted in a statistically significant
and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary
study endpoint of PFS compared with cape monotherapy
as per independent radiology review (median, 5.85
months vs 4.17 months; HR, 0.75 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.64-0.88]; log-rank P ¼ .0003).18 These
results were confirmed by analyses adjusted for potential
prognostic factors, prespecified sensitivity, subset analyses, and investigators’ assessment of PFS. At the time of

last follow-up, 57 (15.2%) patients in the ixabepilone and
cape combination therapy group and 56 (14.9%) patients
in the cape monotherapy group were still alive.
The majority of treatment-related AEs in both
groups were primarily grade 1/2 (99% in the ixabepilone
and cape combination therapy group and 98% in the cape
monotherapy group). In the group receiving ixabepilone
and cape combination therapy, 66% of patients experienced a grade 3/4 treatment-related AE whereas in the

cape monotherapy group, 32% of patients reported a
grade 3/4 treatment-related AE.
Comparison of QOL Outcomes
Figure 1 (Top) summarizes the FBSI change from baseline scores for the 2 treatment groups. The mean baseline
FBSI scores were similar in both groups. A statistically significant difference between the groups with regard to
change from baseline in FBSI scores favoring the group
treated with cape monotherapy was observed (P ¼ .0002).
In the group treated with the combination of ixabepilone
and cape, the FBSI scores remained relatively stable,
whereas the FBSI scores for the cape monotherapy group
improved slightly over the course of the clinical trial. A
larger number of patients in the cape monotherapy arm
discontinued therapy because of disease progression and
had missing assessments after disease progression (week
15: 54.9% vs 35.5%). This disproportionate dropout rate
may have artificially inflated FBSI scores in the cape
monotherapy arm. For those patients who died before
week 24, a value of 0 was imputed for FBSI at all time
points after death up to week 24. With this imputation,
no statistically significant differences were observed
between the treatment groups (Fig. 1 Bottom).
Q-TWiST Analysis
Figure 2 summarizes the unweighted mean duration in
each health state by treatment group. The mean duration
in the TOX state, before disease progression, was 4.3
weeks in the group treated with the combination of ixabepilone and cape and 1.9 weeks in the cape monotherapy
group (P < .0001). The average duration in the TWiST
state was 23.4 weeks in the group treated with the combination of ixabepilone and cape and 20.8 weeks in the
group treated with cape alone (P ¼ .1366). The mean
weeks in the REL state were comparable between the 2
treatment groups (33.2 weeks with combination therapy
vs 33.3 weeks with monotherapy; P ¼ .9756).
The difference in QAS between the group treated
with ixabepilone and cape combination therapy and the
group treated with cape alone ranged from 2.5 weeks to
5.0 weeks depending on relative utilities for different
health states. By varying utility weights between 0 and 1
for TOX and REL, and choosing a weight of 1 for
TWiST, the estimated QAS favored the combination
therapy group, although not all combinations were found
to be statistically significant (Fig. 3). The QAS was 42.2
weeks for the ixabepilone and cape combination therapy
arm compared with 38.4 weeks for patients treated with

0.5 for TOX and REL. If the majority of patients had
TOX values between 0.40 and 0.60 and REL values
between 0.40 and 0.60, the increased QAS for combination therapy with ixabepilone and cape ranged from 3.5
to 4.0 weeks.
An advantage in the benefit-risk ratio for ixabepilone and cape combination therapy in the MBC population was supported by the QAS analyses within
prespecified poor-prognosis groups in the current study.
These analyses demonstrated a greater advantage for each
of the poor-prognosis subgroups (Table 2) (Fig. 3). Across
all subgroup analyses, the combination therapy group had
greater QAS durations (range, 35.3 weeks-45.6 weeks)
compared with the cape monotherapy group (range, 30.4

findings suggest that although combination therapy
resulted in greater time with AEs, the observed difference
in the QAS duration favored combination therapy over

DISCUSSION
Combination therapy with ixabepilone plus cape demonstrated an improvement in the PFS and objective response
rates compared with cape monotherapy in women with
MBC. Similar results were reported for the PFS and
response rates for cape monotherapy in the study by Sparano et al.19 There were no observed differences in FBSI
scores after adjustment for differential dropout rates
between the 2 treatment groups. Combination therapy
resulted in changes in FBSI scores that were comparable
to the cape monotherapy group. A Q-TWiST analysis was
undertaken to better quantify the risk-benefit analysis
with combination therapy.
The comparison of QOL outcomes between the 2
treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant
differences favoring cape monotherapy, although the
changes from baseline in QOL scores in the combination
therapy group were not clinically significant. However, to
fully understand these treatment differences, one needs to
take into account differential missing QOL assessments
between the 2 groups. There were fewer patients in the
ixabepilone and cape combination therapy arm with missing QOL data at weeks 9 through 15. The missing FBSI
scores were likely to be more impaired, given that patients
discontinued protocol treatment and experienced disease
progression. Statistical analyses that do not take disease
progression rates into account may result in an overestimation of the QOL benefits of cape monotherapy. We
used a conservative imputation approach to account for
patients who died before week 24.22,23 After adjustment
for deaths, no significant differences in FBSI scores were
observed between the 2 treatment groups.

466

In the Q-TWiST analysis, all hypothetical utility
combinations were found to be associated with greater
observed QAS for patients in the ixabepilone and cape
combination therapy group compared with those in the
cape monotherapy group. For the most plausible utility
estimates for REL and TOX (ie, 0.40 to 0.60),16,26 these
results represent an additional 3.5 to 4 weeks of QAS.
This increased QAS was achieved despite the increased
time in TOX for the combination therapy group. We also
observed these benefits in QAS for several poor-prognosis
subgroups, which further supports the overall findings of
the current study.
A previous Q-TWiST analysis involving cape
monotherapy found comparable durations of time with
regard to the TOX (1.5 weeks vs 1.9 weeks) and TWiST
(20.8 weeks vs 21.3 weeks) states compared with values
determined in the current analysis.16 This provides some
evidence supporting the validity of the current Q-TWiST
analyses.
A recent study evaluated the quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs) of the combination of ixabepilone and
cape versus cape alone in patients with MBC.27 QALYs
were estimated by adjusting for differences in QOL after
applying mean estimates of OS to each level of response in
a decision model.27 QALYs were estimated at 0.623 for
patients who received the combination of ixabepilone
plus cape and 0.535 for patients who received cape monotherapy. In this model, patients who received ixabepilone
plus cape had a gain of approximately 1 month in their
QOL-adjusted life expectancy (ie, 32 quality-adjusted
days; 95% CI, 3 days-62 days).
A review of Q-TWiST analyses of oncology clinical
trial data recommended that a difference in QAS of 10%
(based on OS) is likely to be clinically significant.28 In this
case, the mean OS was 56 weeks in the cape monotherapy
arm and 61 weeks in the combination therapy arm, indicating 5 weeks of QAS duration that may be clinically significant. For combination therapy, the QAS is somewhat
lower; however, Revicki et al also suggested that differences of 5% may be important to patients.28 Kilbridge et
al29 demonstrated a wide variation in patient preferences
relative to measures such as PFS and OS. Their study recommended that patients’ responses to utility questions
should not be the major deciding factor for an oncologist
when determining treatment options. Patient preferences
may serve as a flag to the treating oncologist that the treatment may not necessarily improve QOL, and further discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of a therapy
option is strongly recommended.

Q-TWiST Analysis of Ixabepilone/Corey-Lisle et al

Approximately 73% of the patients in the cape
monotherapy group discontinued treatment because of
disease progression compared with 60% of patients in the
combination therapy group. The difference in disease progression observed and the absence of clinically meaningful
differences in QOL between the treatment groups suggest
that combination therapy has benefits for patients.
Several limitations should be considered when
reviewing the findings of the current study. First, we did
not have utilities for the model states from patients. However, we did perform sensitivity analyses across a plausible
range of utilities and the findings of the Q-TWiST were
robust to variations within this range of utilities. Second,
the TOX part of the Q-TWiST was based on grade 3 and
4 AEs reported in the clinical study to be consistent with
previous Q-TWiST analyses. The inclusion of grade 2
AEs may increase TOX in both groups and result in different findings.
In summary, the Q-TWiST analyses found that
combination therapy with ixabepilone and cape resulted
in an observed improvement in QAS compared with cape
monotherapy in women with MBC, although the
improvement was modest. This increase was observed for
every combination of valuations for the TOX and REL
states. The most reasonable estimated increased QAS
ranged from 3.5 weeks to 4.0 weeks. In the current study,
the combination of ixabepilone and cape and cape monotherapy demonstrated comparable QOL effects throughout the study and any observed differences were not found
to be clinically significant. The Q-TWiST analysis, in
addition to the clinical data from the trial, supports a positive benefit-risk ratio in favor of the combination of ixabepilone plus cape in patients with advanced MBC that is
refractory to anthracyclines and taxanes versus cape
monotherapy, despite the potential for added toxicities
with the combination therapy.
