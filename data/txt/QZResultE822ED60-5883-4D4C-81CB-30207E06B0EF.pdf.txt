Abstract
The present study shows that oral gavage of 6 Mmol D,Lsulforaphane (SFN), a synthetic analogue of cruciferous
vegetable-derived L isomer, thrice per week beginning at
6 weeks of age, significantly inhibits prostate carcinogenesis
and pulmonary metastasis in TRAMP mice without causing
any side effects. The incidence of the prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia and well-differentiated (WD) carcinoma were f23%
to 28% lower (P < 0.05 compared with control by MannWhitney test) in the dorsolateral prostate (DLP) of SFNtreated mice compared with controls, which was not due to
the suppression of T-antigen expression. The area occupied by
the WD carcinoma was also f44% lower in the DLP of SFNtreated mice relative to that of control mice (P = 0.0011 by
Mann Whitney test). Strikingly, the SFN-treated mice exhibited
f50% and 63% decrease, respectively, in pulmonary metastasis incidence and multiplicity compared with control mice
(P < 0.05 by t test). The DLP from SFN-treated mice showed
decreased cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis when
compared with that from control mice. Additionally, SFN
administration enhanced cytotoxicity of cocultures of natural
killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DC) against TRAMP-C1
target cells, which correlated with infiltration of T cells in the
neoplastic lesions and increased levels of interleukin-12
production by the DC. In conclusion, the results of the present
study indicate that SFN administration inhibits prostate
cancer progression and pulmonary metastasis in TRAMP mice
by reducing cell proliferation and augmenting NK cell lytic
activity. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):2117–25]

Introduction
Epidemiologic studies continue to support the premise that
dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may be protective against
different types of malignancies, including prostate cancer (1–3). The
anticarcinogenic effect of cruciferous vegetables is attributed to
organic isothiocyanates (ITC), which are generated via myrosinasemediated hydrolysis of corresponding glucosinolates (4, 5). The
ITC compound ( )-1-isothiocyanato-(4R)-(methylsulfinyl)-butane
(L-SFN) and its synthetic analogue D,L-sulforaphane (SFN) have

generated a great deal of research interest because of their
remarkable anticancer effects (4–7). For example, L-SFN and SFN
are equipotent inducers of quinone reductase in Hepa1c1c7 murine
hepatoma cells (6). The L-SFN or SFN administration has been
shown to offer protection against 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene–induced mammary cancer in rats, azoxymethane-induced
colonic aberrant crypt foci in rats, and benzo(a)pyrene–induced
forestomach cancer in mice (8–10). Dietary feeding of SFN and its
N-acetylcysteine conjugate inhibited malignant progression of lung
adenomas induced by tobacco carcinogens in A/J mice (11).
Recent studies, including those from our laboratory, have
documented novel cellular responses to SFN treatment in cultured
human cancer cells, including growth arrest, induction of apoptosis
and autophagy, inhibition of histone deacetylase, binding to
proteins, and sensitization of cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(12–21). The mechanism by which SFN causes growth arrest and
apoptosis induction has been extensively studied in human
prostate cancer cells (13, 14, 16–18, 22). For example, we have
shown previously that exposure of human prostate cancer cells to
SFN results in G2-M phase cell cycle arrest via checkpoint kinase
2–mediated phosphorylation of cell division cycle 25C (13). We also
showed that the SFN-induced apoptosis was selective toward
prostate cancer cells and linked to generation of reactive oxygen
species (15, 16). Moreover, oral gavage of SFN in male nude mice
significantly retarded the growth of PC-3 human prostate cancer
xenografts in vivo (22).
Demonstration of in vivo efficacy of potential cancer chemopreventive agents in suitable animal models is a prerequisite for
their further clinical development. The present study was designed
to test whether SFN administration offers protection against
prostate carcinogenesis in a transgenic mouse model of prostate
cancer, TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate).
We now show that oral gavage of SFN significantly prevents
prostate cancer progression and pulmonary metastasis in TRAMP
mice without causing any side effects or affecting the T-antigen
expression.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of SFN. SFN was synthesized as described by Conaway and
colleagues (11). The structure of SFN was confirmed by proton nuclear
magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The purity of the SFN (>99%
pure) preparation was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as described by Conaway and colleagues (11). SFN was stored
at 20jC and found to be stable for at least 6 mo.

Institute), were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 8 mol/L 5a-androstan-17h-ol-3-one, and
antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Stock
solution of SFN was prepared in DMSO, and an equal volume of DMSO
(final concentration, <0.1%) was added to controls. Effect of SFN treatment
on TRAMP-C1 cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion
assay, as described by us previously (23). The proapoptotic effect of SFN was
assessed by the analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation and subdiploid cells, as described by us previously (23, 24).
Immunoblotting. The control and SFN-treated cells were lysed, as
described by us previously (25). Prostate/tumor tissues were thawed on ice,
and samples weighing f100 mg were minced and homogenized in 5
volumes of ice-cold PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.
Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000  g for 10 min at 4jC to
remove tissue debris followed by centrifugation at 14,000  g for 30 min to
obtain clear supernatants. Immunoblotting was performed as described by
us previously (23–25).
SFN treatment. We selected TRAMP mice for the studies described
herein because (a) a well-defined course of disease progression with
similarities to human prostate carcinogenesis from histologic prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to well-differentiated (WD) and poorly
differentiated (PD) carcinoma and distant site metastasis renders TRAMP
mice suitable for chemoprevention studies (26–28), (b) the chemoprevention studies in TRAMP mice can be completed in a reasonable time
frame (27, 28), and (c) the TRAMP model has been used successfully to
test chemopreventive efficacy of several natural agents (29–32). Male
TRAMP[C57BL/6xFVB]F1 hybrid mice were generated by breeding female

TRAMP on a C57BL/6 background with nontransgenic FVB male mice.
Male TRAMP mice were identified by PCR using DNA obtained from tail
clippings (27). After transgene verification, male TRAMP mice were
maintained in a climate-controlled environment with a 12-h light/12-h dark
cycle and fed food and water ad libitum. At 6 to 7 wk of age, mice were
randomized into two groups. Mice in the control group (n = 14) received
0.1 mL PBS by oral gavage thrice per week (Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday), whereas the experimental mice (n = 13) received 6 Amol SFN in
0.1 mL PBS by oral gavage thrice per week for 17 to 19 wk. Body weights of
the control and SFN-treated mice were recorded once each week beginning
at the onset of the study. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last
administration of the vehicle or SFN by CO2 inhalation. A portion of the
prostate/tumor tissue was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
paraffin-embedded.
Pathologic evaluation and scoring of tumor stage. Ten randomly
selected fields of H&E-stained sections of the dorsolateral prostate (DLP)
from individual mice of both control and SFN-treated groups were
independently scored by two researchers for incidence and percentage of
area corresponding to each pathologic stage. Pathologic grading was
performed according to the recommendations of Greenberg and colleagues
(27, 28), as described by us previously (32). Lung and pelvic lymph nodes were
evaluated for the presence of metastasis by two independent researchers.
Pharmacokinetic study. Groups of male nontransgenic mice (n = 3,
6–8 wk of age) were gavaged with 6 Amol SFN in 0.1 mL PBS. Mice were
sacrificed at specified time intervals, and plasma and lung tissue were
collected and kept frozen at 80jC. Plasma (0.1 mL) or a 1:3 (w/v)
homogenate of lung tissue in PBS (0.2 mL) was mixed with 10 AL of

10 Ag/mL alyssin (internal standard, LKT Laboratories). Lung homogenates
were mixed with 1 mL of acetonitrile and centrifuged at 16,000  g for
5 min at room temperature. The resulting supernatants were evaporated to
dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 37jC and reconstituted in
200 AL distilled water/formic acid (200:10, v/v). Plasma samples were mixed
with 5 AL formic acid. Each reconstituted lung or plasma sample was
applied to a Bond Elute (C2, 500 mg, 3 mL) solid-phase cartridge (Varian)
preconditioned with 2 mL of methanol and 2 mL of 1% formic acid. The
cartridges were washed with 2 mL of distilled water/methanol (95:5, v/v).
The SFN and the internal standard were eluted with 2 mL of acetonitrile,
and the eluates were evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of
nitrogen at 37jC. Each dried residue was reconstituted in 100 AL of
acetonitrile/distilled water (15:85, v/v) and transferred to an autosampler
vial, and 10 AL were injected into the HPLC system. The HPLC system
consisted of an Agilent model 1100 autosampler and binary pump (Agilent
Technologies) and a Phenomenex Hydro-Synergi RP (4 Am, 100  2 mm)
reverse-phase analytic column. A gradient mobile phase consisting of
solvent A (acetonitrile/formic acid, 99.9%/0.1%) and solvent B (water/
formic acid, 99.9%/0.1%) was used for separation. The initial condition was
15% solvent A (2 min), which increased linearly in 8 min to 40% solvent A.
This condition was held for 5 min, and then solvent A was linearly returned
to 15% at 16 min. This condition was held for 8 min. The flow rate was
0.2 mL/min. The SFN and the internal standard were detected using a
ThermoFinnigan MSQ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Electron) operating in
positive electrospray, single-ion mode monitoring m/z 177.7 for SFN and
m/z 191.7 for alyssin. Concentrations of SFN were determined by calculating
the ratio of SFN peak area to that of the internal standard and backcalculating the concentration of SFN in the unknown samples with a

concomitantly analyzed standard curve in the respective matrix. Standard
curves were linear over the range of 10 to 10,000 ng/mL and displayed
acceptable performance (accuracy within 15% of nominal concentrations and
precision <15% at all concentrations). Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed
noncompartmentally with PK Solutions 2.0 (Summit Research Service5).
Immunohistochemical analyses of T-antigen, proliferating cell
nuclear antigen, CD31, and E-cadherin expression and quantitation
of apoptotic bodies. Tissues were sectioned at 4 to 5 Am thickness,
deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Immunohistochemical analysis of
T-antigen, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), CD31, and E-cadherin
expression was performed, as described by us previously (32). Apoptotic
bodies were visualized by TUNEL staining, as described by us previously
(32). The images were analyzed using Image ProPlus 5.0 software (Media
Cybernetics) for quantitation of T-antigen, PCNA, and E-cadherin
expression, as well as for analysis of microvessel number (CD31 staining).
Cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and dendritic cells. After transgene
verification, male TRAMP mice (ages, 6–7 wk) were randomized into two
groups with six mice per group. The mice were gavaged thrice weekly
(Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) with either 6 Amol SFN in 0.1 mL PBS or
vehicle (control) for 13 wk. We reasoned that SFN-mediated inhibition of
prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice may be preceded by augmentation
of natural killer (NK)/dendritic cell (DC) function, which prompted us to
terminate this experiment at an earlier time point. The mice were then
sacrificed, and the spleen and bone marrow were harvested from mice of
each group for isolation of NK cells and DCs, respectively, as described by us

previously (32). Cytotoxicity of NK and/or DC toward TRAMP-C1 target
cells was determined using the Cytotox 96 nonradioactive assay, as
described previously by us (32). Quantitation of T-cell and NK cell
infiltration in the DLP was performed by immunohistochemical analysis
of CD3+ and CD57+ cells, respectively, using the double-stain kit from
Biocare Medical according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Quantitation of interleukin-12 and IFN; release. Spleen-derived NK
cells and bone marrow–derived DCs from control and SFN-treated mice
were cultured for 5 d, and the culture media were then collected and
analyzed for IFNg and interleukin-12 (IL-12) release, respectively, using
ELISA kits from Biosource.

Results
SFN treatment decreased viability of TRAMP-C1 cells by
causing apoptosis. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, the viability of
TRAMP-C1 cells was decreased significantly after a 24-hour
exposure to SFN in a dose-dependent manner. The SFN-mediated
suppression of TRAMP-C1 cell viability correlated with apoptosis

induction, as revealed by a dose-dependent increase in cytoplasmic
histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1B) and enrichment of
subdiploid apoptotic fraction (Fig. 1C). Moreover, consistent with
the results in human prostate cancer cells (16, 22), SFN treatment
caused induction of multidomain proapoptotic protein Bax and
down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein (Fig. 1D).
Oral administration of SFN inhibited prostate cancer
progression in TRAMP mice. Next, we proceeded to determine
the effect of SFN administration on prostate carcinogenesis using
TRAMP mice. We have shown previously that thrice weekly oral
gavage of 6 Amol SFN is highly effective in suppressing growth of
PC-3 xenografts in male nude mice (22). We used a similar dosing
regimen in the present study to determine efficacy of SFN against
prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice. Representative H&E
staining in sections of DLP from control and SFN-treated mice are
depicted in Fig. 2A. The DLP of the vehicle-treated control TRAMP
mice exhibited low-grade and high-grade PIN and WD and PD
carcinomas along with areas consistent with normal prostate. The

incidence of the PIN and WD carcinoma in the DLP of mice treated

23% (P = 0.0104), respectively, in comparison with control mice
(Fig. 2B). The area occupied by the WD in the DLP of SFN-treated
mice was lower by f44% (P = 0.0011 by Mann-Whitney test)
compared with control mice (Fig. 2C). Although the area occupied
by the PIN in the DLP of SFN-treated mice was lower by f24%

significance. The body weights of the control and SFN-treated mice
did not differ significantly throughout the experimental protocol

alternate days for signs of stress throughout the experimental
protocol. Except for some mice that were moribund due to large
tumor burden before the termination of the experiment, control
and SFN-treated mice did not exhibit signs of stress, including food
and water withdrawal, impaired posture or movement, ruffled fur,
areas of redness or swelling, and indigestion. Moreover, the vital
organs (liver, kidney, lung, and heart) from control and SFN-treated
mice were histologically normal, except for microscopic evidence of
pulmonary metastasis. However, the SFN-mediated inhibition of
prostate carcinogenesis was not due to suppression of T-antigen
expression (Fig. 2D).

SFN administration inhibited pulmonary metastasis. Figure 3A
depicts H&E staining in lung section of a representative mouse of
both the control and SFN treatment group. The incidence of
pulmonary metastasis was f80% in vehicle-treated control mice,
which was reduced to f40% in the SFN treatment group (Fig. 3B).
The incidence of metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes was comparable
in control and SFN-treated mice (Fig. 3B). Multiplicity of pulmonary
metastatic lesions in mice treated with SFN was lower by f63%
(P = 0.042 by t test) compared with control mice (Fig. 3C).
Pharmacokinetic measurements. We found that SFN was
absorbed rapidly and reached a peak plasma concentration (C max)
of 3,410 ng/mL at a T max of f42 minutes (Fig. 3D). The terminal
elimination half-life of SFN in plasma was f255 minutes. The C max
of SFN in the lung was f3,686 ng/g with a T max of f15 minutes.
The area under the concentration versus time curve between 0 and
8 hours (AUC0-8) of SFN in lung (5.80 Ag/g h) was 47% higher than
the AUC0-8 of SFN in plasma (3.94 Ag/mL h).
SFN administration decreased cell proliferation. We determined expression of PCNA, a well-accepted marker of cell
proliferation (33), by immunohistochemistry to test whether SFNmediated suppression of prostate carcinogenesis was due to
inhibition of cellular proliferation. As can be seen in Fig. 4A,
PCNA expression was f40% lower in the DLP of mice treated with
SFN compared with control mice (P = 0.028 by t test). The fraction
of TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies was f1.9-fold higher in the
DLP of SFN-treated mice compared with the controls, but the
difference was statistically insignificant due to large data scatter,
especially in the SFN treatment group (Fig. 4B).
SFN exhibits antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo (34). To
test whether SFN administration caused suppression of neovascularization in vivo, the DLP from vehicle-treated control mice
and SFN-treated mice were stained for angiogenic marker CD31.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

Immunohistochemical staining for CD31 in the DLP of representative mouse from both the control and SFN groups are shown in
Fig. 4C (vessels are identified by arrows). The average number of
vessels in the DLP did not differ significantly between control and
SFN-treated mice (Fig. 4C).
E-cadherin is considered a suppressor of invasion and growth of
many epithelial cancers (35). We, therefore, compared expression of
E-cadherin in the DLP of control and SFN-treated mice. Expression
of E-cadherin was slightly higher in the DLP of SFN-treated mice
compared with that of control mice, but the difference was
statistically insignificant. These results indicated that the SFNmediated inhibition of prostate carcinogenesis correlated with
decreased cellular proliferation, as well as a modest increase in the
number of apoptotic bodies in the DLP.
Effect of SFN administration on levels of Bcl-2 family proteins.
We compared expression of Bcl-2 family proteins using prostate/
tumor supernatants to determine the mechanism of SFN-mediated
apoptosis. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the levels of proapoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins Bad, Bak, Bax, and Bid were higher by f1.33-fold,
1.16-fold, 1.27-fold, and 1.9-fold, respectively, in the prostate of
SFN-treated mice compared with controls. Additionally, SFN
administration resulted in a marked decrease (f63% decrease
compared with control) in the level of antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1
compared with control (Fig. 5). The level of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) was f2.7-fold higher in the prostate of SFNtreated mice compared with the control (Fig. 5).
SFN augmented cytotoxic activity of NK/DC cocultures
against TRAMP-C1 cells. The NK cells play an important role in
immunosurveillance during tumorigenesis (36, 37). The NK cells
mediate cytotoxicity against tumor cells by multiple mechanisms,
including granule-mediated exocytosis and induction of apoptosis
(36). To assess if SFN administration affected NK cell/DC function,

we determined the cytotoxicity of NK cells and/or DC isolated from
control and SFN-treated mice toward TRAMP-C1 as a target cell
line. The results in Fig. 6A show that the NK cells isolated from the
spleen of SFN-treated TRAMP mice were more cytotoxic against
TRAMP-C1 cells compared with the NK cells isolated from control
mice (23% versus 50% cytotoxicity for NK cells isolated from
control and SFN-treated mice, respectively; P < 0.05 by t test). It is
well established that interactions of NK cells with DC result in
coactivation of both cell types (38). We, therefore, determined the
lytic functions of NK cell and DC cocultures. The cytotoxic activity
of NK cells against TRAMP-C1 cells was increased even more with
coculture of NK cells with DC at 10:8 ratio compared with NK cells

alone. This effect correlated with a significant increase in IL-12
production by the DC isolated from the bone marrow of SFNtreated mice compared with control mice (Fig. 6B, left). On the
other hand, the IFNg production by the NK cells did not differ
significantly between control and SFN-treated mice (Fig. 6B, right).
Altogether, these results indicate that SFN administration stimulates immune response by augmenting NK cell lytic function
through DC-mediated IL-12 production.
SFN administration caused T-cell infiltration in the prostate
tumor. Next, we explored the possibility of whether the prostate
tumor from SFN-treated mice was infiltrated by carriers of an
adaptive immune response, such as T cells. We stained prostate

tumors from control and SFN-treated mice using anti-CD3 (a
marker of T cells) and anti-CD57 (a marker of NK cells) antibodies.
The results can be visualized in Fig. 6C, where NK cells are stained
in brown and the T cells are stained in pink. The prostate tumors
from SFN-treated mice exhibited a modest yet statistically
significant increase in T-cell, but not NK cell, infiltration compared
with control (Fig. 6D). Taken together, our results indicate that SFN
administration increases immunosurveillance by boosting both the
NK cell lytic function and T-cell infiltration.

Discussion
The present study shows that SFN not only suppresses the
growth of a TRAMP tumor–derived cell line in culture but also
prevents incidence and/or burden of PIN and well-differentiated
carcinoma and incidence and multiplicity of lung metastasis
in male TRAMP mice without causing weight loss or affecting
the T-antigen expression. The possibility that higher concentration
of SFN and/or a more intensive dosing regimen (e.g., daily
administration) results in better chemopreventive response cannot
be ruled out. Likewise, it is possible that earlier onset of SFN
administration (e.g., starting at 4–5 weeks of age) leads to even
greater protection against prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice.
Additional work is needed to systematically explore these
possibilities.
The bioavailability of SFN in TRAMP mice is yet to be evaluated,
but this variable has been determined in rats. The SFN was
detectable in the plasma after 1 hour of oral gavage of rats with
50 Amol SFN (39). The maximal plasma concentration of SFN was
found to be f20 Amol/L after 4 hours of oral gavage and declined
with a half-life of 2.2 hours (39). Hanlon and colleagues (40) have
shown that SFN is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability
of f82% in rats (40). The maximal plasma concentration of SFN
and its cysteine conjugate varied between 0.65 and 0.82 Amol/L in
healthy human volunteers, who consumed a test meal of broccoli
soup (150 mL) containing 100 g of broccoli (41). The SFN
concentration effective against prostate carcinogenesis and pulmonary metastasis in TRAMP mice is well within the range that
may not only be generated through dietary intake of cruciferous
vegetables but can also be safely given to humans without any
harmful side effects (5, 42).
We have shown previously that SFN treatment suppresses
growth of cultured human prostate cancer cells by causing G2-M
phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction (13, 16, 21, 22). The
present study reveals that a cell line derived from the prostate
tumor of a TRAMP mouse is also highly sensitive to growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction by SFN treatment. We also
found that oral administration of SFN causes a statistically
significant decrease in cell proliferation in the DLP of TRAMP
mice, as evidenced by reduced expression of PCNA. Moreover, the
average number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies was markedly
higher in the DLP of SFN-treated mice in comparison with
controls. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that SFN-mediated

inhibition of prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice in vivo is
mediated by reduced cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis.
Distant site metastasis is a major cause of death in prostate
cancer patients (43). The pathogenesis of metastasis is complex
and involves a series of molecular events, including synthesis and
secretion of angiogenic factors to promote neovascularization,
motility, and local invasion of the host stroma, entry into the
circulation, detachment, and extravasation (44). Steps leading to
metastasis are complex and regulated by multiple molecules,
including growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases, and cell
adhesion molecules (44). For example, loss of expression of cell
adhesion molecules, especially E-cadherin, is believed to be
important for development of metastatic lesions (35). Inhibition
of prostate carcinogenesis and metastasis by the plant flavonoid
apigenin in TRAMP mice was shown to correlate with retained
expression of E-cadherin (29). The present study reveals that the
SFN administration inhibits pulmonary metastasis incidence and
multiplicity in TRAMP mice. However, the inhibitory effect of SFN
administration against pulmonary metastasis seems independent
of changes in E-cadherin expression or inhibition of angiogenesis.
Delineation of the precise mechanisms by which SFN administration inhibits pulmonary metastasis awaits further work.
The present study shows, for the first time, that treatment of
TRAMP mice with SFN leads to increased production of IL-12 by
DC. This effect results in augmentation of NK cell cytotoxicity
toward a prostate cancer cell line and increased efficiency of DC
activation of NK cell cytotoxic function after their coculture.
Previous studies have documented the capacity for DC to
internalize, process and present tumor cell-derived antigens, and
thereby to stimulate the antitumor function of both CTLs and
IFNg-producing NK cells (45, 46). In addition to the stimulatory
effects of SFN administration on in vitro functions of NK cells and
DC, we observed an increase in T-cell infiltration in the prostate
tumors of SFN-treated TRAMP mice in comparison with control
mice. Taken together, our results suggest that SFN can enhance
immune function toward prostate tumors by stimulating IL-12
release by DC, leading to an increased level of cytotoxicity of NK
cells and ultimately to a greater infiltration of prostate tumors by
T cells, which results in a lower tumor burden and less metastases.
In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that oral
administration of SFN significantly inhibits prostate carcinogenesis
and pulmonary metastasis in TRAMP mice without causing any
harmful side effects or reducing T-antigen expression.
