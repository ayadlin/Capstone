ABSTRACT
Bisphosphonates are standard treatments for bone metastases. When given in
the adjuvant setting, they reduce breast cancer mortality and recurrence in bone but
only among post-menopausal patients. Optimal drug use would require biomarkerbased patient selection. Such biomarkers are not yet in clinical use. Based on the
similarities in inflammatory responses to bisphosphonates and Toll-like receptor (TLR)
agonists, we hypothesized that TLR9 expression may affect bisphosphonate responses
in cells. We compared bisphosphonate effects in breast cancer cell lines with low
or high TLR9 expression. We discovered that cells with decreased TLR9 expression
are significantly more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of bisphosphonates
in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, cancer growth-promoting effects seen with some
bisphosphonates in some control shRNA cells were not detected in TLR9 shRNA
cells. These differences were not associated with inhibition of Rap1A prenylation
or p38 phosphorylation, which are known markers for bisphosphonate activity.
However, TLR9 shRNA cells exhibited increased sensitivity to ApppI, a metabolite
that accumulates in cells after bisphosphonate treatment. We conclude that decreased
TLR9-expression sensitizes breast cancer cells to the growth inhibitory effects of
bisphosphonates. Our results suggest that TLR9 should be studied as a potential
biomarker for adjuvant bisphosphonate sensitivity among breast cancer patients.

conditions that involve increased osteoclast activity, such
as postmenopausal or treatment-induced osteoporosis,
multiple myeloma and skeletal metastases of solid
tumors [1, 2]. In these settings, BPs are unequivocally
beneficial as they inhibit hypercalcemia, bone pain and
fractures. Apart from the rare side effects, which include

oesophageal irritation, renal dysfunction, osteonecrosis of
the jaws, and atypical sub-trochanteric femoral fractures,
BPs are generally well tolerated [3, 4].
Depending on their molecular structure, these drugs
are divided into pyrophosphate-resembling (p-BPs, such
as clodronate and etidronate) and nitrogen-containing BPs
(n-BPs, such as alendronate, pamidronate, risedronate
and zoledronate) [5]. The newer n-BPs are more potent
inhibitors of bone resorption, zoledronate being the
most potent. The cellular mechanisms of action of BPs
vary according to their molecular structure. P-BPs are
metabolized into toxic, apoptosis-inducing ATP-analogs
(AppCCl2) inside the cells. The primary mode of action of
n-BPs is to inhibit the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase of
the mevalonate pathway, which is in the beginning of the
cholesterol biosynthesis [5, 6]. This results in a decreased
cellular pool of prenyl groups and leads to impaired posttranscriptional prenylation of small GTPases that are
required for a great variety of cellular functions, such as
vesicular transportation during the bone resorption phase
of osteoclasts [5, 7]. In addition, although n-BPs are not
metabolized into ATP-analogs, they induce intracellular
formation of such an analog, ApppI [8].
BPs exhibit high affinity to bone matrix
hydroxyapatite. This and the inhibition of vicious cycle
between osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and tumor
growth in bone are considered the primary mechanisms
mediating their anti-tumor efficacy in bone metastases
[9, 10]. However, unlike initially thought, it is now clear
that n-BPs may have direct anti-tumor effects also in soft
tissues [11–17]. These direct cancer growth inhibitory
effects of n-BPs are also mediated via the mevalonate
pathway and intracellular ApppI [17–20]. Discovery of the
anti-tumor effects has shifted the focus of BP studies from
treating bone metastases to their adjuvant use, especially
in early breast cancer [21, 22]. Several large clinical
adjuvant trials have been conducted by now, mostly with
zoledronate, to address whether adjuvant BPs prevent
relapses in bone or elsewhere and affect breast cancer
mortality [23–26]. These studies have been conducted in
unselected breast cancer patient populations and in many
of them BPs were found to be beneficial only among postmenopausal women. A recent, large meta-analysis of these
studies, consisting of 18206 patients indeed confirmed
that only post-menopausal breast cancer patients benefit
from adjuvant BPs. In this patient group, adjuvant BPs
produced highly significant reductions in bone recurrence
(RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60–0.86; 2p=0.0002) and breast
cancer mortality (RR 0.82, 0.73–0.93; 2p=0.002).These
effects were independent of tumor parameters (estrogen
receptor status or grade), nodal status, bisphosphonate
class, or dosing schedule or concomitant chemotherapy
[23, 26]. Taken together, these studies suggest that there
is a subset of post-menopausal breast cancer patients who
may greatly benefit from adjuvant BPs in terms of relapses
and survival [26]. Identification of such patients based on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumor characteristics would allow optimal adjuvant BP
use. Currently, however, there are no such biomarkers in
clinical use.
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an intracellular
DNA-receptor that recognizes both microbial and hostderived DNA [27]. TLR9 activation initiates a rapid
and a robust innate immune response, with increased
secretion of inflammatory mediators [27]. We have
previously demonstrated that TLR9 is widely expressed
in breast cancers [28–30]. We also showed that tumor
TLR9 expression is associated with prognosis, but only
among patients that have triple-negative tumors for which
there are no targeted therapies [30]. Interestingly, n-BPs
induce a similar rapid inflammatory response as TLRligands in cells[31, 33]. Furthermore, n-BPs have been
shown to potentiate the pro-inflammatory effects of TLR
ligands in bone marrow- or peripheral blood-derived
mononuclear cells [34]. Based on the similarities in the
responses of TLR ligands and BPs, we hypothesized that
TLR9 expression may affect cellular responses to BPs. We
demonstrate here for the first time that decreased TLR9
expression sensitizes breast cancer cells to the growth
inhibitory effects of both p- and n-BPs. Our results suggest
that tumor TLR9 expression status should be investigated
as a potential biomarker for adjuvant BP use in breast
cancer.

RESULTS
Breast cancer cells with decreased TLR9
expression exhibit increased sensitivity to the
growth inhibitory effects of BPs in vitro
We initially studied the growth effects of n-BPs
with single cell MDA-MB-231 clones that were stably
transfected with a plasmid-based TLR9 shRNA or the
corresponding empty vector [35]. The cells were cultured
in the presence of vehicle or with 100 μM zoledronate
or alendronate for 48 h, after which proliferation was
measured with a BrdU-assay. Both BPs inhibited
significantly the proliferation of all cells. The effect was,
however, significantly more pronounced in the TLR9
shRNA cells than in the control shRNA cells (Figure 1A).
To study this initial observation further, we did similar
studies but now with pools of MDA-MB-231 and CAL51 cells that had been stably transfected with control or
TLR9 shRNA [30, 36]. The cells were treated with vehicle
or 1-100 μM zoledronate or pamidronate. Viability was
measured at 24 or 72 h time points with MTS assay.
BPs did not affect the viability of either control or TLR9
shRNA MDA-MB-231 cells at 24 h. However, at 72
h both zoledronate and pamidronate induced a dosedependent decrease in MDA-MB-231 cell viability.
Depending slightly on the n-BP and concentration used,
the effects were, however, significantly more pronounced
in the TLR9 shRNA cells than in the control shRNA cells

(Figures 1B – 1C). In CAL-51 cells, changes in viability
were detected already after 24 h. Compared with the
vehicle treatment, all studied zoledronate concentrations
actually increased viability of the control shRNA CAL51 cells, but not of the TLR9 shRNA CAL-51 cells.
Pamidronate (100 μM) decreased significantly control
shRNA CAL-51 cell viability. Also this effect was more
pronounced in the TLR9 shRNA CAL-51 cells. Finally,
the lower pamidronate concentrations (1 – 10 μM) induced
a significant increase in control shRNA CAL-51 viability,
but not in the TLR9 shRNA CAL-51 cells (Figure 1D).
Next, we measured the effects of BPs on cell growth
as a function of cell confluency, using the IncuCyte setup. Representative images of the vehicle- and zoledronatetreated MDA-MB-231 cells are shown in Supplementary
Figure S2. Only the highest zoledronate concentration
(100 μM) significantly inhibited the growth of control
shRNA MDA-MB-231 cells, while 10 μM zoledronate had
no effect (Figure 2A). On the contrary, both zoledronate
concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of the
TLR9 shRNA cells. Furthermore, the zoledronate-induced
growth delays started to show earlier in the TLR9 shRNA
cells (Figure 2B). Alendronate (1 or 10 μM) had no effect
on the growth of control shRNA MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 2C). In TLR9 shRNA cells, 10 μM alendronate
was significantly growth inhibitory (Figure 2D). Also the
growth inhibitory effects of pamidronate and risedronate
were more pronounced in the TLR9 shRNA cells, in
comparison to control shRNA cells (Figures 2E – 2H).
Finally, similar differences, although weaker, were also
detected between control and TLR9 shRNA MDAMB-231 cells after clodronate treatment. In control
shRNA cells, neither clodronate concentration affected
growth. In the TLR9 shRNA cells, both clodronate
concentrations induced a small but a significant growth
inhibition (Figures 2I – 2J). The relative confluency of the
control and TLR9 shRNA cells was compared at the final
time point. Although the effect was slightly BP moleculeand concentration-dependent, BPs had a more profound
growth inhibitory effect on TLR9 shRNA cells in all cases.
The effect was most dramatic with 10 μM zoledronate
(Figure 3).
We performed similar studies also with the ERpositive control and TLR9 shRNA T47-D cells. In
essence, the results were similar to those seen in MDAMB-231 cells. The growth of the T47-D TLR9 shRNA
cells was inhibited with smaller BP concentrations and/or
they exhibited a greater growth inhibitory response to BPs
than the corresponding control shRNA cells (Figure 4).
Again, although the effect was slightly BP moleculeand concentration-dependent, BPs had a more profound
growth inhibitory effect in TLR9 shRNA cells in all cases.
When the growth inhibition was compared at the final
time point, the effect was most dramatic with 100 μM
zoledronate (Figure 5). Similarly, both pamidronate and
alendronate were stronger inducers of growth inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in TLR9 shRNA 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells,
as compared with the corresponding control shRNA
cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Of the two BPs studied
with the 4T1 cell line, 10 μM pamidronate had the
most dramatic effect. Taken together, regardless of the
differences between the BP concentrations and cell lines
used, these results suggest that cells with decreased TLR9
expression are more sensitive to the growth inhibitory
effects of BPs. The effect is greatest with n-BPs, but it is
also detectable with clodronate. These results are in line
with those observed with parental cell lines. MCF-7 cells,
which express lower TLR9 protein levels than MDAMB-231 or T47-D cells [29], are also the most sensitive to
BPs (Supplementary Figure S4).

Inhibition of Rap1A prenylation and p38
phosphorylation are independent of TLR9
To begin to investigate the possible mechanism
behind the differences in sensitivity, we investigated
BP effects on the mevalonate pathway, using Rap1A
prenylation as a marker of n-BP activity [5, 17, 37, 38].
As expected, zoledronate induced a dose-dependent
accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A and this was blocked
by adding geranylgeraniol to the cultures. The results were
similar in both control and TLR9 shRNA MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 6A). We also compared BP effects on p38
phosphorylation in control and TLR9 shRNA MDAMB-231 cells. This was done because it has been shown
that BP-induced activation of p38 signals for resistance
against their growth inhibitory effects [37, 38]. However,
both clodronate and zoledronate induced a comparable
degree of p38 phosphorylation (Figure 6B). Similar
results were seen also with control and TLR9 shRNA
T47-C cells (Supplementary Figure S5). Taken together,
these results suggest that the increased sensitivity of the
TLR9 shRNA cells to the growth inhibitory effects of
zoledronate is independent of protein prenylation or p38
phosphorylation.

MDA-MB-231 TLR9 shRNA cells exhibit
increased sensitivity to ApppI
In addition to the prenylation effects, inhibition
of the mevalonate pathway by n-BPs also induces the
intracellular accumulation of ApppI, which has been
suggested to mediate zoledronate-induced cancer cell
death [8, 20, 39, 40]. We therefore investigated whether
TLR9 expression affects cellular sensitivity to ApppI.
Control or TLR9 shRNA cells in the MDA-MB-231 or
CAL-51 background were cultured in the presence of
vehicle or 1 mM ApppI, followed by assessment of cell
viability with MTS assay at various time points. This
ApppI concentration was chosen, because it was the
lowest of several tested concentrations that demonstrated
an effect on the viability of these cells. In general, the

CAL-51 cells appeared more sensitive to ApppI, and
unlike MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrated a significant
decrease in viability by 1 mM ApppI already after 24
h. Although TLR9 shRNA cells in both backgrounds

demonstrated increased sensitivity to ApppI over the
corresponding control shRNA cells, this difference
was statistically significant only in the MDA-MB-231

expression confers increased cellular sensitivity to
the growth inhibitory effects of BPs in breast cancer.
Although also detected with clodronate, the effects were
most pronounced with n-BPs. We also demonstrated that
in some cases BPs actually promoted tumor cell growth
and this effect was lost with decreased TLR9 expression.
Thus, the increased sensitivity could actually indicate
that BPs promote cancer cell growth via TLR9. When
TLR9 expression is absent or down-regulated, the growth
promotion is lost, resulting in the net effect of tumor
inhibition. Although it has been shown also previously
that BPs have tumor-promoting effects, they have been
largely overlooked midst the reports on their anti-tumor
effects. For example, Saarto and coworkers concluded in
one of the very first adjuvant BP studies that clodronate
increases tumor recurrence at soft tissue sites when given
to primary breast cancer patients with node-positive
disease [41]. Adjuvant ibandronate significantly increased
adrenal metastases in a pre-clinical MDA-MB-231 mouse
model [42]. Finally, BPs have demonstrated growth
promoting effects in breast cancer cells also in vitro [43,
44]. Taken together, our new results suggest that tumor
TLR9 expression could mediate these tumor-promoting
effects in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer
cells. However, no tumor promoting effects by BPs were
detected in the recent large meta-analysis of adjuvant BPs,
suggesting that in the clinical situation, the net responses
of tumors to BPs are either no response or inhibited tumor
growth [26].
Interestingly, n-BPs induced a similar accumulation
of unprenylated Rap1A in both control and TLR9
shRNA cells, suggesting that the sensitivity difference is
independent of n-BP effects on the mevalonate pathway.
Furthermore, BPs induced a similar degree of p38
phosphorylation both in control and TLR9 shRNA cells,
suggesting that a differential activation of the protective
p38-mediated pathway does not explain the results either
[18, 37]. Another possibility is that there is redundancy in
the activation of these pathways by BPs and thus, these
issues require further characterization.
How could TLR9 then mediate cancer cell BP
responsiveness? Clues of such mechanisms could be
drawn from the inflammatory effects of BPs. In addition
to their osteoclast-inhibiting actions, BPs have also
well-documented immunomodulatory effects [45].
Specifically, p-BPs are considered anti-inflammatory,
while n-BPs are pro-inflammatory [32, 46, 47].
Interestingly, n-BP treatment shares many similarities
with activation of inflammasomes, which are cytoplasmic
complexes comprised of the ASC, NALP- and Caspase-1
proteins [48]. One of the best understood is the NALP3
inflammasome. Upon ligand binding, NALP3 recruits
the inflammatory Caspase-1 into the inflammasome
complex. The activated Caspase-1 then processes pro-IL1β and pro-IL-18 into their active, secreted forms and this
alerts the body for inflammation [49]. Also n-BPs induce

To begin to investigate the in vivo significance
of our observation, we inoculated control and TLR9
shRNA MDA-MB-231 cells into the mammary fat pads
of nude mice, which were subsequently treated with
vehicle or zoledronate (0.3 mg/kg 3 times per week,
from day 4 to day 25).The aim of this experiment was
to establish the proof-of-principle that tumor TLR9 may
affect BP responses also in vivo. Therefore, to increase
the possibility of detecting an anti-tumor effect with
zoledronate, the drug was given at a dose and dosing
frequency that is higher than those currently given
to patients.Tumor growth was followed with caliper
measurements as a function of time. We also performed
tumor oxygen measurements at day 24, as our previous
studies suggested that hypoxia helps to maintain TLR9
expression difference between control and TLR9 shRNA
MDA-MB-231 tumors [30]. Our measurements confirmed
that all tumors in this study were hypoxic (Supplementary
Figure S6). The TLR9 shRNA MDA-MB-231 cells formed
larger tumors than the control shRNA cells, as expected
based on our previous study [30]. Whereas zoledronate
treatment did not affect the growth of the control shRNA
tumors, zoledronate significantly inhibited the growth
of TLR9 shRNA MDA-MB-231 tumors (Figures 8A –
8B). Furthermore, dissected zoledronate-treated control
shRNA tumors had significantly higher volumes than the
corresponding vehicle-treated tumors. No such volume
difference was detected in dissected TLR9 shRNA tumors
(Figure 8C). Finally, we used bone mineral density (BMD)
measurements as an intrinsic control for zoledronate
efficacy. Zoledronate induced a significant increase of
BMD at the cortical bone of tibiae of control shRNA
tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that despite the lack of
effect on the tumor growth in this group, the drug was
biologically active. An increase in BMD was also detected
in the zoledronate-treated, TLR9 shRNA tumor-bearing
mice (Figure 8D).

DISCUSSION
Data from a recent meta-analysis support the notion
that adjuvant BPs decrease breast cancer mortality and
prevent distant recurrence, especially in bone [26]. These
beneficial effects were significant only among postmenopausal patients and the absolute benefits remained
small. Thus, the numbers needed to treat are high (30
for the mortality benefit and 45 for the bone recurrence
benefit) [26]. Furthermore, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms for these desired effects are unclear.
We show here, rather surprisingly, that tumor TLR9
expression status affects the direct tumor responses to
BPs in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, low tumor TLR9

Caspase-1 activation and IL-1β and IL-18 upregulation
[50–54]. This effect of n-BPs could also be mediated via
inhibition of the mevalonate pathway as geranylgeraniol,
whose formation n-BPs suppress, inhibits Caspase-1
activation. Thus, n-BPs could block the negative feedback
of geranylgeraniol on Caspase-1 activation [52, 55]. Our
data suggests that TLR9 does not interfere with n-BP
effects on geranylgeraniol deprivation. Thus, TLR9 could
rather mediate BP effects downstream of Caspase-1
activation. Interestingly, TLR9 has been shown to act
in close collaboration with NALP3 inflammasome for
example in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and
in acute pancreatitis [56, 57]. Furthermore, adenosine,
ATP and ADP have been shown to activate the NALP3
inflammasome [58, 59]. It remains to be studied whether
the intracellular ATP-like metabolites of BPs, AppCCl2
and ApppI, are also recognized via the NALP3 [8, 39, 40].
TLR9 shRNA cells, however, demonstrated increased
sensitivity over that of the control shRNA cells to the
growth inhibitory effects of ApppI. Finally, there is also a
possible link between the post-menopausal status, tumor

TLR9 expression and adjuvant zoledronate anti-tumor
efficacy. Menopause has profound effects on both adaptive
and innate immune systems. Furthermore, ERα and sex
steroids regulate TLR9 expression in breast cancer [28,
60, 61]. Therefore, declining hormone levels could result
in decreased TLR9 expression in breast cancer cells.
There are no previous publications on menopause effects
on TLR9 expression and also these aspects require further
investigation.
Our findings have several clinical implications.
First, the role of TLR9 as a biomarker for adjuvant BP
efficacy should be studied in clinical breast cancer trials.
Interestingly, Westbrook and coworkers recently described
the first biomarker for BP use in breast cancer. Whether or
not TLR9 is on the same molecular pathway than CAPG
and GIPC1 remains to be studied [62–63]. Second, we
and others recently described a novel, poor prognosis
subgroup of breast cancer [30, 63]. These patients have
triple-negative disease (TNBC) with low tumor TLR9
expression upon diagnosis. Their disease-specific survival
is significantly worse than of those patients whose

otherwise similar TNBC tumors have higher TLR9
expression. Especially the low TLR9-TNBC patient group
might benefit from adjuvant zoledronate and this should
be addressed in a separate clinical trial. Finally, in addition
to breast cancer, the significance of our finding should be
further studied also in other cancers where BPs are much
used or where low tumor TLR9 expression is associated
with poor outcome, such as renal cell carcinoma [64].
In conclusion, low tumor TLR9 expression
sensitizes breast cancer cells to the growth inhibitory
effects of BPs in vitro and in vivo. Although observed with
all BPs, the finding was most pronounced with n-BPs. The
molecular mechanisms behind this finding are not known
and require further experimenting. The significance of this
finding needs to be verified in clinical trials.

cell clones were selected, using standard techniques.
These cells were characterized previously in detail [35].
For stably transfected cell pools (MDA-MB-231 and
T47-D), the TLR9 shRNA or control shRNA sequences
were first cloned into pSuper-EGFP vector by the vendor
(Oligoengine). Transfection, selection and characterization
of these cells have been previously published [30].
The CAL-51 and 4T1 cells were transfected with
lentiviral-based TLR9 or control shRNA constructs.
Characterization and transfection of the CAL-51 cells has
been previously described [36]. The murine mammary
carcinoma 4T1 cells were stably transfected with mousespecific lentiviral particles containing either control (nonmammalian) shRNA or TLR9 shRNA (Mission lentiviral
transduction particles, Sigma) and selected in the presence
of puromycin (6 μg/ml, Sigma). TLR9 mRNA expression
in the 4T1 cells was characterized with qRT-PCR, as
previously explained [30].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Western blot analysis

Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and
mouse 4T1 mammary tumor cells, which both lack
the expression of ER, PR and HER2 and are thus
considered as triple-negative, and the estrogen receptor
expressing human T47-D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells
were originally from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were
cultured as previously described in detail [30]. Human
CAL-51 breast cancer cells are also triple-negative
and they were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig,
Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (GibcoBRL, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK)
supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and
non-essential amino acids (all from Gibco BRL, Life
Technologies) [65]. All cell cultures were done a 37°C
atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air (~ 21 % pO2).

The cells were cultured on 6-well plates in normal
culture medium until near confluency, after which they
were rinsed with sterile PBS and cultured further for 24 h
in serum-free culture medium containing bisphosphonates
and/or geranylgeraniol (25 μM). At the desired time-point,
the culture medium was discarded and the cells were
quickly harvested in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA) and clarified by centrifugation, as previously
described in detail. After boiling the supernatants in
reducing SDS sample buffer, equal amounts of protein
(~100 mg) were loaded per lane and the samples
were electrophoresed into 10% or 4-20 % gradient
polyacrylamide SDS gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C with the corresponding
antibodies Rap1A SC-1482 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX),
Rap1 SC-65 (Santa Cruz), p38 (Cell Signaling) or p-p38
(Cell Signaling), diluted 1:500 in Tris-buffered saline,
0.1 % (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST). Secondary detection was
performed with HRP-linked secondary antibodies (GE
Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). The protein bands were
visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL) [30, 37].

ApppI synthesis
All chemicals for the ApppI synthesis were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The detailed
procedure for the ApppI synthesis is given in
Supplementary Figure 1. Geranylgeraniol (cold, all trans)
was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals
(St. Louis, MO). Bisphosphonates were purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO), dissolved in d-H2O at a final
concentration of 10-2 M, and sterile-filtered.

Growth assays
For a standard BrdU-assay, 10 000 cells were plated
in 100 μl of normal growth medium containing vehicle or
the indicated bisphosphonates for an indicated length of
time. Incorporated BrdU was measured with a commercial
kit, according to the manufacturer's recommendations
(Exalpha Biologicals, Watertown, MA). For a standard
MTS assay, the cells were plated on 96-well plates
(10 000 cells per 100 μl per well) in normal growth
medium, supplemented with 1-100 μM of the indicated

RNA interference
TLR9 down-regulation was done with a plasmidbased approach, as previously described. Briefly, TLR9
short hairpin (shRNA) sequence or a control, non-targeting
shRNA sequence was cloned into the pSuper vector by
the vendor (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA). The plasmids
were stably transfected into MDA-MB-231 and single

BPs or vehicle as a control treatment. Cell viability was
measured with the CellTiter 96 Aqueus One Solution
Cell Proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin),
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell
growth was also measured as a function of confluency,
using IncuCyte FLR and IncuCyte ZOOM® (Essen
BioScience Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) kinetic high-content
live cell microscopes. Briefly, 2000-4000 cells were
plated in 100 μl per well to 96-well plate with the desired
concentrations (1-100 μM) of indicated BPs or vehicle.
The default software parameters with a 10× objective were
used for imaging. The IncuCyte 2010A or 2014A software
(Essen BioScience Ltd.) was used to calculate mean
confluences of the individual wells (3-8 parallel wells per
treatment group) from phase contrast images.

to establish a stable pO2 level, which was then registered
and stored. Two tumors from each group at study day 24
were measured over a time period of 20 minutes after a
stabilization period of approximately 5 min. The gluteus
muscle of the experimental animal served as a control site
after measurements to verify the proper function of the
Licox® probe (data not shown).

Bone density measurement
Left tibiae were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, stored
in 70% ethanol at 4°C, and scanned using pQCT (XCT
540; Stratec, Birkenfeld, Germany). For the tibiae, 3
cross-sections (at 0.25 mm intervals) were analyzed 1.8
mm from a reference line placed at the proximal end of
the tibia, and 1 section was analyzed at the midshaft.
Standardized analysis with an image voxel size of 0.07
mm3 was performed. Density thresholds of 0.5 mg/cm3 for
trabecular bone and 0.71 mg/cm3 for cortical bone were
used.

In vivo experiment
MDA-MB-231 pools, stably transfected with the
control or TLR9 shRNA plasmids, were inoculated into
the mammary fat pads (106 cells in 100 μl PBS, n = 60
mice) of four-week-old female nude mice (Athymic nude/
nu Foxn1 mice, Harlan, the Netherlands). Starting on day
3 after tumor cell inoculation, the tumor diameters were
measured and tumor volumes were calculated using the
formula V = (π/6)(d1 × d2) 3/2, where d1 and d2 are the
perpendicular tumor diameters [30]. On day 4, the mice
were stratified into 4 groups (n = 15 per group), and
administered with vehicle or zoledronate (0.3 mg/kg) 3
times a week throughout the experiment. After 3 weeks
(on day 26), the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were
dissected and measured. Oxygen partial pressures were
measured in representative tumors on day 24, as explained
below. Throughout the experiments, the animals were
maintained under controlled pathogen-free environmental
conditions. Animal welfare was monitored daily for
clinical signs. The animal experiment procedures were
reviewed and approved by the State Provincial Offices of
Finland, the license ESAVI/3257/04.10.07/2014.

Statistical analysis
Data is expressed as mean ± S.D. or ± S.E.M., as
indicated. Student's unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA
were used to calculate statistically significant differences
(p<0.05) between the various study groups.

Oxygen partial pressure (pO2) measurement
In order to measure pO2 values in tumors, we used
sterile, flexible polarographic electrodes (diameter 0.47
mm) of the Clark type (Licox® GMS, Kiel-Mielkendorf,
Germany), supplied with a probe-specific microchip
allowing automatic calibration. The probe was inserted
into the tumor tissue by advancing it in a retrograde
manner along the lumen of an insertion needle catheter,
which was then removed. Tissue temperature was
measured with a needle probe and temperature-adjusted
pO2 (mmHg) was graphically displayed and stored
digitally. The whole length of the oxygen-sensitive part of
the probe was at least 2 mm inside the tumor throughout
the measurements to prevent contamination from room-air
O2. The duration of the pO2-measurement was sufficient
