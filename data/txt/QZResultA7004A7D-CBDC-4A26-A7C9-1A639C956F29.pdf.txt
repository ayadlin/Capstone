BACKGROUND: In the current study, the authors sought to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemoresistance of lung cancer stem or initiation cells (cancer stem cells). METHODS: A549 lung cancer cells before and after selective enrichment of a subpopulation of cancer stem cells were treated with superoxide and traditional
chemotherapeutics to determine their sensitivity or resistance to these cytotoxic agents. Apoptotic activity was
measured using a variety of fluorescence-based and biochemical techniques. Specific pathways involved in the chemoresistance of cancer stem cell-enriched lung cancer cells were analyzed with Western blotting and pharmacologic
targeting therapy in a xenograft model. RESULTS: Lung cancer stem cells exhibited significantly decreased apoptotic
response to treatment with superoxide, cisplatin, gemcitabine, or a combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine compared with control A549 cells. Apoptotic resistance was mediated through the inactivation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Increased activation of p38MAPK, MAPKAPK2, and Hsp27 was observed in lung cancer stem cells compared
with control A549 cells both before and after exposure to superoxide and chemotoxic agents. In a mouse model of
lung cancer, chemotherapy-induced cells increased in the antiapoptosis pathway, and quercetin, an inhibitor of
Hsp27, combined with traditional chemotherapy was effective in blocking the pathway and in the treatment of lung
tumors in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The authors’ data demonstrate that lung cancer stem cells have elevated levels of
activated Hsp27 upon treatment with superoxide and traditional chemotherapy. When combined with chemotoxic
agents, blockage of Hsp27 decreased the survival of lung cancer stem cells, which otherwise were resistant to tradiC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Lung cancer has become the most frequent cause of cancer death in the world.1 The poor prognosis of lung cancer
patients is due mainly to poor response, early relapse, and metastasis after treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
The discovery of cancer stem or initiation cells (cancer stem cells) as cancer-initiating components in leukemia and solid
tumors opens an attractive approach in treating cancer.2 Cancer stem cells represent a minor population of cancer cells
and possess stem cell self-renewing and multipotent properties.3 Dysregulation of cancer stem cell self-renewal is a likely
requirement for the development of cancer.4 In addition, unresponsiveness or survival of cancer stem cells after treatment
may be responsible for the recurrence and resistance of cancer to modern therapies.5 Therefore, current cancer therapies
may be improved by targeting the self-renewal and survival capacities of cancer stem cells.6
The underlying mechanisms of resistance of lung cancer stem cells to chemotherapy are unclear. Heat shock proteins
(Hsps) comprise several different families of proteins that are induced in response to a wide variety of physiological and
environmental insults.7 Hsp27 is a 27 kDa protein that regulates apoptosis through interaction with key components of
apoptotic signaling pathways, in particular, those involved in caspase activation.8 Several lines of evidence support a role
for Hsp27 in cancer. In general, high basal levels of Hsp27 are found in a wide range of tumor cells and tissues, including
colorectal and breast cancers.9,10 In lung cancer, Hsp27 was reported to be associated with the poor prognosis of
patients.11 It is well documented that culture conditions with reduced serum in the presence of epidermal growth factor

cancer stem cells.12 In the current study, we enriched a
cancer stem cell population in a lung cancer cell line using
this method and demonstrated that cancer stem cellenriched lung cancer cells are more resistant to traditional
chemotherapy. Increased resistance is because of constitutive activation of Hsp27 and its upstream signaling pathways, p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2. Moreover, we showed
that pharmacological inactivation of the Hsp27 pathways
sensitized cancer stem cells to undergo apoptosis and
improved the effects of traditional chemotherapy.

Cells and Culture Conditions
The lung cancer cell line A549 was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 lg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, and 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco), in a 37 C humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For enrichment, cancer stem cells
were cultured in tumor sphere medium consisting of serum-free DMEM/F12 medium, N2 supplement, 5 ng/
mL human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), and 10 ng/mL EGF.12

RNA Extraction and Real-Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction Analysis
Cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Total
RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and subsequently reverse transcribed using random hexamers and
SuperScript II reverse transcriptase enzyme (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done with SYBR
Green Real-Time Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions on the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed to
generate a PCR product of <200 bp. Each 15 lL PCR
contained 1.5 lL diluted cDNA (24 ng starting total
RNA). Thermal cycling conditions were 50 C for 2
minutes and 95 C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of
15 seconds at 95 C, 30 seconds at 58 C, and 30 seconds
at 72 C. Levels of expression were normalized to the
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
housekeeping gene.

Side Population Analysis
The cell suspensions were labeled with Hoechst 33342
dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) using the methods described by Goodell et al13
with modifications. Briefly, cells were resuspended at 1 
106/mL in prewarmed DMEM (Invitrogen; Life Technologies, Rockville, Md) with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and 10 mmol/L HEPES
buffer (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Hoechst 33342
dye was added at a final concentration of 5 lg/mL in the
presence or absence of verapamil (50 lmol/L; Sigma, St
Louis, Mo), and the cells were incubated at 37 C for 90
minutes with intermittent shaking, then centrifuged
down at 4 C, and resuspended in ice-cold Hanks balanced salt solution containing 2% FCS and 10 mmol/L
HEPES. Propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 2 lg/mL was added to the
cells to gate viable cells. The cells were filtered through a
40 lm cell strainer to obtain single cell suspension before
sorting. Analyses and sorting were done on a FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, Mass). The Hoechst
33342 dye was excited at 357 nm, and its fluorescence was

Cell extracts were prepared with M-PER (Pierce, Rockford, Ill) plus a protease inhibitor cocktail (Halt; Pierce),
and protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA assay (Pierce). Aliquots of protein lysates were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate–10% polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters, which were blocked with 5% blotting grade
milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif) in TBST (20 mM TrisHCl [pH 7.6], 137 mM NaCl, 1% Tween 20). Membranes were then probed with the indicated primary antibodies (Hsp27, Nanog, Oct4 [H-134], Sox2, Santa Cruz,
Heidelberg, Germany; pHSP27, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn; MAPKAPK2, pMAPKAPK2, p38MAPK,

assay (Millipore, Billerica, Mass). Membranes were
exposed to x-ray film to observe the bands (Amersham

MTT Assay
Cell numbers were determined using the MTT (3-[4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)
assay (Sigma). Tumor cells and enriched cancer stem cells
(5  103 cells per well) were grown in 96-well plates, and
treated with H2O2, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and quercetin at
different dosages for 48 hours. After incubation, the media
was replaced with 50 lL of MTT reagent (2 mg/mL) and
incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 C for 2 hours. After incubation, the media were aspirated and dimethylsulfoxide (50
lL) was added to each well. The optical density of each
well was measured using a microplate reader (560 nm).
Assays for Apoptosis
Apoptosis was assayed with a TUNEL assay that detected
and stained fragmented DNA (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche, Indianapolis, Ind). In brief, cells were
harvested by trypsin treatment, stained with TUNEL, and
observed using a fluorescence microscope. For the detection of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, protein lysates
were prepared and detected by Western blot with primary
antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies.
Tumor Cell Xenograft Mouse Models
Study protocols involving mice were approved by the
Institutional Animal Committee of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were obtained from
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me) and maintained as
a colony at the National Taiwan University Animal Facility (Taipei, Taiwan) in specific pathogen-free conditions.
The mice were used for experiments at 6 to 8 weeks of
age. Lung cancer cells and enriched cancer stem cells were
injected subcutaneously at a dose of 104, 105, and 106,
respectively, per injection site. Tumor nodules usually
became palpable within 1 week and reached about 2 to
7 mm in diameter 2 weeks after cell injection. The length
and width of the tumors were measured, and tumor volume was calculated (tumor volume ¼ length  width2/2).
Each mouse was injected intraperitoneally with 80 mg/kg
gemcitabine (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif), 5
mg/kg cisplatin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, Wash), or
50 mg/kg quercetin (Sigma) every 3 days for 3.

staining was performed on 4 lm-thick sections of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. After deparaffinization and rehydration, all sections were treated with
microwave irradiation in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for 10 minutes at 121 C for antigen retrieval. To block
endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were
immersed in serum for 10 minutes. Then all sections were
incubated at 4 C overnight with the antibodies. Color
reaction was performed using the labeled streptavidin biotin technique with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine as a chromogen
(LSABþ kit, HRP; DakoCytomation; Glostrup, Denmark). Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and
then dehydrated.

All values are expressed as mean  standard deviation. Independent t test was performed for comparison of data of
independent samples. A P value <.05 was considered
significant.

RESULTS
Serum-Free Culture Enriches A549 Cells With
Cancer Initiation Properties
A549 tumor cells cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with EGF and FGF2 (tumor sphere medium)
showed sphere formation approximately 14 days after
subculture from parental A549 cells (Fig. 1A) and showed
increased expression of the stem cell markers Nanog,
Sox2, and Oct4 (Fig. 1B). These cells also demonstrated
increased capacity to form tumors in immunodeficient
mice compared with the bulk control cells (Fig. 1C).
Tumors formed by these cells had the same histomorphology and expressed the same markers as primary lung
tumors or tumors formed by bulk A549 cells (Fig. 1D),
indicating that tumors were indeed of lung cancer origin.
These data suggest cells cultured in tumor sphere medium
became enriched in properties of cancer stem cells. In this
study, these enriched cancer stem cells are referred to as
tumor stemlike cells.

concentration of superoxide, A549 cells showed significant cell death (Fig. 2A). Tumor stemlike cells also exhibited resistance to cell death induced by cisplatin,
gemcitabine, and a combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine at concentrations that caused significant death in
A549 cells (Fig. 2B). To investigate if the resistance of tumor stemlike cells to these cytotoxic agents was because of
inhibition of apoptosis, various measurements for apoptosis were performed under these conditions. DNA fragmentation assayed by the TUNEL technique revealed that
apoptosis induced by superoxide, or cisplatin, gemcitabine, and a combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine,
treatment was significantly reduced in tumor stemlike
cells compared with control A549 cells (Fig. 3A). Parallel
Western blot analysis of the proapoptotic proteins caspase-9 and caspase-3 showed decreased amounts of the
activated forms in tumor stemlike cells, providing confirmation of decreased apoptotic activity in these cells under
cytotoxic conditions (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the
survival of tumor stemlike cells after superoxide exposure
and treatment with cytotoxic agents may be mediated by

inhibition of apoptosis through the inactivation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.
Resistance to Apoptosis Involves Activation
of the p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2-Hsp27 pathway
Evidence has shown that Hsp27 can inhibit apoptosis
through inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage by
directly interacting with procaspase-9 and procaspase-3
molecules.14,15 To investigate whether the activation of
Hsp27 underlies the antiapoptotic effects exhibited by
lung tumor stemlike cells upon treatment with superoxide
and cytotoxic agents, activation levels of Hsp27 were compared between tumor stemlike cells and A549 cells. Interestingly, increased phosphorylation of Hsp27 at residue
Ser78 was observed in tumor stemlike cells compared
with control A549 cells both before and after exposure to
superoxide and cytotoxic agents (Fig. 4A). Upon stimulation by stress, p38MAPK is phosphorylated, which then
phosphorylates MAPKAPK2 to phosphorylate Hsp27.16
To investigate whether the same molecular mechanisms
are involved in activation of Hsp27 in lung cancer tumor

stemlike cells, activation levels of these signaling molecules were compared between tumor stemlike cells and
A549 cells. Similar to Hsp27 activation, increased activation of p38MAPK and MAPKAPK2 was observed in tumor stemlike cells compared with control A549 cells both
before and after exposure to superoxide and cytotoxic
agents (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that the p38MAPKMAPKAPK2-Hsp27 stress pathways are constitutively
active in tumor stemlike cells.
To examine the involvement of these pathways in
the antiapoptotic effects of tumor stemlike cells upon
stimulation with superoxide or cytotoxic agents, quercetin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp27, KRIBB3, an inhibitor
of Hsp27 phosphorylation, and SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38MAPK were coincubated with superoxide
or cytotoxic agents. In addition, knockdown experiments
to silence the expression of Hsp27 and p38MAPK using
siRNAs were also performed. Interestingly, quercetin
(Fig. 5A), KRIBB3 (Fig. 5B), siRNA against Hsp27 (Fig.
5C), SB203580 (Fig. 5D), and siRNA against p38MAPK
(Fig. 5E) all increased cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3
and subsequent apoptosis upon treatment with the proapoptotic agents. Together, these data suggest that constitutive activation of p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2-Hsp27
plays an antiapoptotic role in lung tumor stemlike cells.
Because side population cells in different human lung cancer cell lines have been shown to have the properties of
cancer stem cells,17 we examined whether these cells are
resistant to chemotherapy via the Hsp27-associated pathway. However, we found that A549 side population cells
did not show heightened resistance to traditional chemotherapy, although side population cells did express more
ABCG2 transporter than nonside population cells as both
mRNA and protein. Moreover, the addition of quercetin
did not change the response of A549 to traditional chemotherapy (Fig. 6).

Figure 2. Tumor stemlike cells (TS-LC) are resistant to cell
death induced by superoxide and cytotoxic agents. Control
A549 cells (CTR) and TS-LC were treated with indicated concentrations of H2O2 (A) or various chemotoxic agents (B), and
MTT assay was performed 48 hours later. Data from MTT assay
are shown as cell survival rate after normalization with vehicle
control (concentration ¼ 0). (A) MTT assay after treatment
with 1000 mM H2O2 shows increased TS-LC survival compared

survival after treatment with cisplatin, gemcitabine, or both in

Quercetin Inhibits Tumor Growth In Vivo
When Combined With Chemotherapy
Because the Hsp27 inhibitor quercetin has been studied
in clinical trials,18 we decided to test the effects of this
compound on an in vivo system. First, the MTT assay
demonstrated that treatment with quercetin combined
with cisplatin and gemcitabine is more efficacious than
cisplatin, gemcitabine, and a combination of cisplatin and
gemcitabine in killing tumor stemlike cells (Fig. 7A). To
transfer these findings into an in vivo system, we developed a mouse xenograft model of human lung cancer by
subcutaneously transplanting A549 lung cancer cells in

NOD-SCID mice. Once tumors became palpable
(around 0.2 to 0.7 cm in diameter), cytotoxic therapy
with cisplatin, gemcitabine, and quercetin was administered. The volume of xenograft was measured and compared between different groups up to 28 days. The
cytotoxic treatment of cisplatin or gemcitabine marginally
inhibited tumor progression, and the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine further inhibited tumor growth.
Moreover, the tumor volume was significantly smaller in
the group treated with quercetin combined with traditional chemotherapy, compared with those groups treated
with traditional chemotherapy only (P < .05, MannWhitney test, Fig. 7B). Tumor blocks retrieved from the
animals before and after treatment were submitted for immunohistochemical analysis for the expression of
embryonic markers and p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2-Hsp27
pathway proteins. The expression of embryonic markers
such as Oct 4, Nanog, and Sox2 increased after chemotherapy treatment. After combined treatment with

1521

Original Article

quercetin, the expression of embryonic markers decreased
(Fig. 8). Moreover, the p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2-Hsp27
pathway proteins increased after chemotherapy, but
decreased again when quercetin was added in combination (Fig. 9A and B). Similarly, Western blotting analysis
also demonstrated that p38MAPK, MAPKAPK2, and
Hsp27 protein expression increased in tumors treated

with cytotoxic agents, and decreased in tumors treated
with cytotoxic agents and quercetin (Fig. 9C). These
results suggest that quercetin is effective in the treatment
of lung tumor in vivo when combined with traditional
chemotherapy for lung cancer.

DISCUSSION
Cancer stem cells are thought to play multiple roles in
tumorigenicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that
the side population cells in human lung cancer cell lines
are an enriched source of lung tumor-initiating cells with
stem cell properties.17 Recently, we demonstrated that
Oct4 expression plays a critical role in maintaining the
self-renewal, cancer stem cell-like, and chemo- and radioresistance properties of lung cancer stem cells.19 Hilbe et
al showed that lung cancer patients had a significant
increase in CD133-positive endothelial progenitor cells,
and the authors speculated that these cells may be involved
in tumor vasculogenesis and tumor growth.20 On the basis of these studies, lung cancer cell lines either with
CD133-positive cells or other cells with stem cell-like
properties including Oct4 expression may be good models
for investigation of lung cancer treatment. The current
surface markers, such as CD133, used for cancer stem cell
identification still lack reliability, because only 1 of 262
CD133þ cells is a true cancer stem cell,21 and CD133
cells also possess some cancer stem cell properties to initiate tumor in cancer such as colorectal cancer and lung cancer.22,23 In the current study, we therefore chose tumor
stemlike cells enriched with serum-free medium in the
presence of EGF and FGF2 for investigating the antiapoptosis pathways of lung cancer stem cells. Reynolds and
Weiss described the method of isolation using serum-free
medium to acquire spheres in which stem cells such as
neural stem cells can obtain their proliferative benefit and

A549 cells (CTR) and TS-LC were treated with 3.175 lM cisplatin plus 0.74 mg/mL gemcitabine in the absence or presence of the indicated concentration of 30 lM quercetin (A),
10 lM KRIBB3 (B), knockdown of Hsp27 with siRNA (C) or 50
lM SB203580 (D), or knockdown of p38MAPK with siRNA
(E), and TUNEL assay and Western blotting assay were performed 2 days later. Western blotting assay and TUNEL assay
showed that inhibition of Hsp27 activity with quercetin (A),
dephosphorylation of Hsp27 with KRIBB3 (B), knockdown of
Hsp27 with siRNA (C), inhibition of p38MAPK with SB203580
(D), or knockdown of p38MAPK with siRNA (E) increased the
cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis upon treatment with the chemotoxic agents.

induce renewal capacity.24 Since the initial description of
this method, it has been successfully applied in the isolation of cancer stem cells from other kinds of malignant
tumors including brain tumor and lung cancer.12,25 In
this study, the A549 subpopulation used for test was
derived from spheres formed 2 weeks after culture. Cells
derived from these spheres increased in the expression of
embryonic markers including Oct4 and Nanog compared
with control A549 parental cells both in vitro and in vivo.
We also showed that these sphere-derived cells can form
secondary spheres. These cells, after in vivo implantation,
increased in the ability to form lung tumor compared

1524

with control A549 parental cells and expressed characteristic markers of differentiated lung cancer such as CK7
and CK20, as shown in the Figure 1. In our laboratory,
we had tested the subpopulation 45 days after enrichment
and found that the cells maintained the features of cancer
stem cells, including the expression of embryonic markers
and increase in tumorigenicity. Similar to this report,
Eramo et al also demonstrated that cells enriched in these
conditions are tumorigenic in vivo, reproduce human tumor, and lose self-renewal and tumorigenic potential
upon differentiation.25
In addition to the capacity of cancer stem cells to initiate tumor growth after in vivo transplantation, cancer
stem cells also are thought to be responsible for tumor recurrence and progression after cancer treatment. This is
thought to occur by the increased activation of specific
molecules and signaling pathways in cancer stem cells. For
example, the chemoresistant property of colorectal cancer
stem cells is mediated by activation of interleukin-4, and
radioresistance of brain tumors is mediated by the DNA
repair mechanism in glioma cancer stem cells and by the
PTEN/stat3 pathway in medulloblastoma cancer stem
cells.4,26,27 The recurrence and progression of cancer with
continuous treatment remains a major problem, and the
underlying mechanisms are still unclear. As shown here,
the lung cancer tumor stemlike cells used in these studies
exhibit properties of cancer stem cells. Tumor stemlike
cells were resistant to superoxide treatment and chemotherapy in vitro through constitutive activation of Hsp27.
Superoxide treatment was used to demonstrate the resistance of tumor stemlike cells to stress such as oxidative
stress compared with the parental lung cancer cells. The
effect of radiation was not determined in this study. However, we had previously investigated the effect of radiation
on lung tumor stemlike cells and found that knockdown
of Oct4 expression in lung cancer cells with positive
CD133 surface marker can effectively enhance their chemoradiosensitivities and apoptotic activities in response
to irradiation and chemotherapy. On the basis of the multiple roles of Hsp27 in response to different stresses, the
role of Hsp27 in the antiapoptosis effects of cancer stem
cells necessitates more investigation.
In the study, we also performed side population cell
analysis of A549 cells and found that drug transporterABCG2 expression was >2 higher in side population
cells than nonside population cells, not as high as was
reported in Ho et al,17 but similar to the report of Seo
et al.28 However, we could not find the property of chemoresistance in A549 side population cells, and inhibition

Figure 8. Immunohistochemical analysis of embryonic markers including Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 proteins before and after treatment is shown. Tumor xenograft models of lung cancer were exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy by injection of 5 mg/kg cisplatin,
(every 4 days, 3, intraperitoneally [i.p.]), 80 mg/kg gemcitabine (every 4 days, 3, i.p.), and 50 mg/kg quercetin (every 4 days, 3,
i.p.). Tumors were removed for immunohistochemical staining. (A) Pictures show immunohistochemical staining of Oct4, Nanog,
and Sox2 proteins in tumor xenografts without or with combination of quercetin with cisplatin and gemcitabine. Scale bar indicates

of the Hsp27 pathway did not have any effects on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in these cells. These data suggest that tumor stemlike cells enriched by serum-free
culture and side population cells are different subpopulations in A549 cells.

Hsp27 was also reported to be associated with poor prognosis in gastric, liver, and prostate cancer.29 Oba et al
recently demonstrated that interferon-c can down-regulate Hsp27 expression and enhance tumor suppression in
A549 lung cancer cells.30 The studies regarding the relationship between the Hsp27-p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2

Western blotting analysis demonstrated that phosphorylated p38MAPK, MAPKAPK2, and Hsp27 protein expression increased in
tumors treated with cytotoxic agents. The phosphorylated p38MAPK, MAPKAPK2, and Hsp27 protein expressions decreased in
tumors treated with cytotoxic agents and quercetin, compared with those protein expressions in tumors treated with cytotoxic
agents alone.

signal pathway and chemoresistance of lung cancer are
limited. We showed in this study that this signal pathway
of Hsp27 plays a role in chemoresistance of lung cancer.
Other signal pathways such as the PTEN/PI3K/AKT
pathway have been reported to be critical for prostate cancer stemlike cell maintenance.31 Bleau et al also showed
that PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway regulates the side population phenotype and ABCG2 activity in glioma tumor
stemlike cells.32
Quercetin (3,30 ,4’’,5,7-pentahydroxy flavone), 1 of
the most widely distributed bioflavonoids in the plant
kingdom, is known to have antitumor effects.33,34 In
1990, Hosokawa demonstrated that quercetin can inhibit
the synthesis of Hsps in HeLa cells.33 In 1994, Wei et al
reported that quercetin displayed antitumor activity by
triggering apoptosis in vitro.34 Furthermore, JakubowiczGil and coworkers suggested that reduction of Hsp27
expression in HeLa cells promotes quercetin-induced apoptosis.35 Until now, the anticancer effects of quercetin
combined with traditional chemotherapy including cisplatin and gemcitabine in lung cancer cells was undetermined. Here we demonstrate for the first time the
sustained activation of Hsp27 in lung cancer stem cells
when treated with chemotherapy, suggesting that Hsp27
may serve as a potential target to eliminate lung cancer resistance to anticancer therapies. We also show for the first
time that quercetin, when combined with traditional
chemotherapy for lung cancer, is effective to reduce lung
tumor growth in a xenograft model.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that lung cancer stem cells with elevated Hsp27 activation are resistant
to insult by superoxide and traditional chemotherapy for
lung cancer. When combined with traditional chemotherapy, quercetin, an inhibitor of Hsp27, effectively
decreased the survival of lung cancer stem cells, which
otherwise were resistant to traditional chemotherapy. Targeting the antiapoptotic pathway of cancer stem cells may
represent a new strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.
