BACKGROUND: Discrepancies exist regarding the impact of neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) on the risk of allcause mortality (ACM) in men who receive brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer. Therefore, the objective of
the current study was to examine the effect of NHT on the risk of ACM in men with prostate cancer who receive with
brachytherapy. METHODS: The study cohort included 2474 men with localized prostate cancer who either received
NHT (N ¼ 1083) or did not receive NHT (N ¼ 1391) and brachytherapy without supplemental external beam radiation
between 1991 and 2005 at centers within the 21st Century Oncology Consortium. All men had at least 2 years of follow-up. Low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk disease was present in 65%, 23%, and 12% of men, respectively. A
Cox regression multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the risk of ACM in men who received NHT compared with
all others adjusting for age, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and tumor classification. RESULTS: After a
median follow-up of 4.8 years (interquartile range, 3.3-7.5 years) and adjusting for known prostate cancer prognostic
factors and age, treatment with NHT was associated significantly with an increased risk of ACM (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.53; P ¼ .04) in men aged 73 years. In men who were younger than the median age of 73 years, hormone therapy use was not significant (P ¼ .34). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with men who
were younger than the median age of 73 years, men aged 73 years with localized prostate cancer who received
brachytherapy and NHT had an increased risk of ACM compared with men who did not receive NHT. Cancer

Prostate brachytherapy is used often for the treatment of men with localized prostate cancer. In patients who receive
brachytherapy, the use of neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has become more common increasingly over the
past 2 decades.1 The rationale for it use includes an effort to reduce prostate volume before brachytherapy, to improve urinary
flow, or to take advantage of the possible synergistic effects expected when hormone suppression and radiation are used. However, it has not been established that androgen deprivation improves the outcomes of patients with low-risk disease, yet androgen deprivation may have a negative impact on cardiovascular health.2-4 Therefore, understanding the impact of its use in
these patients is important, and the results and consequences of ADT are worthy of further clinical research.
Specifically, discrepancy exists in the literature regarding the impact of neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) on the
risk of all-cause mortality (ACM) in men who receive prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer. In 1 study,
men with a median age of 73 years had an increased risk of ACM with the use of NHT,5 whereas this increased risk was
not noted in a second study of men with a median age of 67 years.6 Therefore, the objective of the current study was to
examine the effect of NHT on the risk of ACM in men with localized prostate cancer who were treated with brachytherapy
within the 21st Century Oncology Consortium in an age-adjusted and stratified analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Treatment
Between May 1991 and September 2005, 7166 men with
localized prostate cancer were received brachytherapy at
20 centers within the 21st Century Oncology Consortium. Pretreatment and follow-up information for these
patients was collected prospectively in a database maintained by 21st Century Oncology. The records of these
men were reviewed retrospectively. This study was
approved under Institutional Review Board Protocol
1087891.
Patients were excluded if they received supplemental
external-beam radiation (n ¼ 3744) or if they had <2
years of follow-up (n ¼ 948). The final study cohort
included 2474 men with a median age of 73 years (range,
45-91 years) who had localized prostate cancer that was
treated with brachytherapy and no supplemental externalbeam radiation therapy. Low-risk, intermediate-risk, and
high-risk disease according to the risk categorization system defined by D’Amico et al was present in 65%, 23%,
and 12% of men, respectively.7 Table 1 shows the baseline
characteristics of the patient population stratified according to the median age73 and the use of ADT.
All men were treated with ultrasound-guided
brachytherapy using iodine-125 or palladium-103 sources. Three weeks before the date of implantation, the
patient underwent an ultrasound volume study of the
prostate. Then, the calculated volume was used to determine the number of sources to be ordered for the procedure. A pubic arch study often was performed before
implantation to rule out pubic arch interference for prostate volumes >30 cc.
Treatment planning was performed intraoperatively. The patient was placed in the extended dorsolithotomy position, and axial ultrasound imaging of the
prostate was performed with 5-mm separation between
images. These images were transferred to a treatmentplanning computer located in the operating room. The
prostate volume was contoured on each image and designated as the planning target volume (PTV). The urethra
and rectum were contoured as organs at risk. A distribution of sources was entered on the image set, and the
dose was calculated. Planning was an iterative process
with changes in source number and position until a satisfactory dose distribution was achieved. Treatment-planning goals included a PTV V100 >95%, urethra
<125% prescription dose, and rectum <85% prescription dose. Implantation followed after plan approval by
the radiation oncologist.

Follow-Up and Ascertainment of
Survival Status
Follow-up started on the day of the brachytherapy implantation and concluded on January 26, 2007 or the date of death,
whichever came first. Patients generally were seen every 6
months for 4 years and annually thereafter. At each followup visit, a history and physical examination, including a digital rectal examination and a serum prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) level before the digital rectal examination, was performed. The Social Security Death Index was used to identify
patients who had died and those who remained alive.
Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patient
population. The patient’s baseline characteristics were compared using a chi-square metric for categorical variables and
a Wilcoxon 2-sample test for distributions of medians in
men who had received ADT versus those who had not. The
men were stratified further by the median age.8-9
The primary endpoint of this study was ACM, which
was calculated using Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis.10
Comparisons of this statistic across treatment groups were
performed using a 2-sided log-rank test. Then, a Cox regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of
ACM.11 Covariates that we examined included patient age
(continuous), tumor (T) classification (T1 vs T2 and T3),
Gleason score (<7 vs 7), pretreatment PSA level (continuous), and the use of ADT (Lupron or Zoladex vs none). A
test for an interaction between hormone therapy use and age
also was performed. The Cox model was performed for all
men and included the interaction term and was performed
again in men who were younger than the median age of 73
years and men aged 73 years. The PSA values were logtransformed to approximate a normal distribution. Hazard
ratios (HRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
and P values were calculated for each covariate.
All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a 2-sided P
value .05 was considered statistically significant. R version 2.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) was used for all calculations pertaining
to competing risk analyses. SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all other calculations.

patients who received ADT, compared with those who
did not, had a higher median PSA level (P < .001), a
higher proportion of Gleason scores from 7 to 10 (P <
.001), and a higher proportion with clinical T3 disease
(P ¼ .001). In men aged <73 years, comparisons included
a higher proportion with Gleason scores from 7 to 10 (P ¼
.01) but a similar PSA distribution (P ¼ .19) and a higher
proportion of T2 disease (P ¼ .05). There were no patients
with T3 disease in the group aged <73 years. The median
duration of NHT in the men aged <73 years was 3.3
months (interquartile range [IQR], 2.4-4.9 months). In the
men aged 73 years, the median duration of NHT was 3.6
months (IQR, 2.5-5.6 months).
Cox Regression Analysis of the Time to
All-Cause Mortality
After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 643 of 2474 men
(26%) had died. The results of the Cox regression analysis
examining the relation between ADT use and ACM in all
patients indicated that there was a significant interaction
term between hormone therapy and increasing age
(adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P ¼ .0035), as
shown in Table 2. In this analysis, age (P ¼ .0013) and
hormone therapy use (P ¼ .0049) also were associated sig-

nificantly with the risk of ACM; whereas known prostate
cancer prognostic factors, including PSA level, biopsy
Gleason score, and clinical T classification, were not associated with the risk of ACM.
In the subgroup of men who were younger than the
median age of 73 years, hormone therapy use was not
associated significantly with ACM (P ¼ .34). However,
hormone therapy use was associated significantly with the
risk of ACM in men aged >73 years (adjusted HR, 1.24;
95% CI, 1.01-1.53; P ¼ .0369) as was increasing age
(adjusted HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P ¼ .0002).
Estimates of All-Cause Mortality
Figure 1 indicates that there was a significant increase
(P ¼ .01) in the estimates of ACM for men aged 73
years and who received neoadjuvant ADT compared with
those who did not. However, as indicated by Figure 2,
estimates of ACM were not significantly different (P ¼
.34) when the analysis was stratified by ADT use among
men aged <73 years.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we identified a significant interaction
between hormone therapy use and age. Hormone therapy

Prior studies have examined the effect of NHT on
ACM in patients with localized prostate cancer. The results
of those studies were contradictory; however, now, they can
be explained given the results of the current study, in which
we demonstrated that there was increased mortality with
ADT only among older men, consistent with an earlier
study by Beyer et al in which the median age was 73 years.5
Also revealed in the current study and consistent with the
previous study by Merrick et al, we did not observe an

association between ACM and NHT among men of similar
age in the study by Merrick et al, who had a median age of
67 years.6 The separation in the survival curves for the older
men occurred after 8 years. This suggests that the impact on
mortality may be secondary to the adverse effect of ADT on
cardiovascular risk factors. If this is true, then it would take
time for the effect of ADT to manifest as a cardiovascular
mortality-related event.2
A few points require further discussion. First, it is
important to note that, in this exploratory, retrospective
analysis, although we observed an association between
hormone therapy use and an increased risk of ACM in elderly men, this does not prove causality. Specifically, these
results are hypothesis generating; and, to prove causation,
it would be necessary to perform a prospective study
designed specifically to examine hormone therapy use and
its impact on ACM.
Second, data on testosterone recovery were not available for the patients in this study. However, in older men,
generally, there is a longer time to testosterone recovery,
and this may have influenced our results.12
Third, causes of death were not available for all
patients in this study. Therefore, we chose to report on
overall survival status. Because an increase in ACM was
noted only for men aged >73 years, in whom increased
comorbid illness would be expected compared with men
aged <73 years, it is likely that the interaction noted in a
postrandomization analysis between ADT and the Adult
Comorbidity Evaluation-27 comorbidity score, in which
men with moderate to severe comorbidity did not benefit
in terms of overall survival for the addition of ADT to
radiotherapy, also may explain the current results.13 Specifically, ADT may accentuate underlying comorbidity,
which probably is cardiovascular based on previous
reports.2-4,13
Finally, prior randomized studies have demonstrated an overall and/or cancer-specific survival benefit
with the addition of hormone therapy to external-beam
radiation in men with high-risk disease.13-17 In the current study, 12% of patients had high-risk disease; however, hormone therapy was used in conjunction with
brachytherapy, and a survival benefit has not been demonstrated with the addition of hormone therapy in that setting.18 Therefore, because there may be a detriment to
ADT use in older men, as suggested by the current results,
and because the men who were selected for treatment who
had high-risk disease represented the community-based
practice for implantation monotherapy with or without

Cancer

hormone therapy, we believe that their inclusion was
important.
In conclusion, compared with men aged <73 years,
men aged 73 years with localized prostate cancer who
are treated with brachytherapy and NHT have an
increased risk of ACM compared with men who are not
treated with NHT. Physicians should carefully weigh the
risks and benefits of hormone therapy in each individual
patient when designing the treatment plan.
