BACKGROUND: Stem cell transplant (SCT)-related outcomes and prognostication for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL)
are not well-defined in the post-rituximab era. METHODS: Through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) lymphoma
outcomes study, 184 patients with relapsed/refractory FL who underwent autologous SCT (autoSCT) or allogenic SCT (alloSCT) following disease relapse after prior rituximab-based therapy were examined. RESULTS: Patients who underwent autoSCT (N 5 136)
were older compared with patients who underwent alloSCT (N 5 48) (54 versus 51 years, respectively, P 5.01) and more frequently
had grade 3 FL (35% versus 8%, respectively, P 5.006). Patients who underwent alloSCT received more prior therapies (4 versus 3,
respectively, P <.0001) and more often had resistant disease at SCT (19% versus 6%, respectively, P 5.008). Cumulative 100-day nonrelapse mortality (NRM) for autoSCT and alloSCT were 1% and 6%, respectively (P <.0001), whereas 3-year NRM rates were 3% versus
24%, respectively (P <.0001). For autoSCT and alloSCT, cumulative rates of relapse, progression, and/or transformation were 32% versus 16%, respectively (P 5.03), whereas 3-year overall survival rates were 87% versus 61% (P <.0001); there were no differences in
failure-free survival. AlloSCT was associated with increased risk of death on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 5 2.77, 95% confidence
interval 5 1.46-5.26, P 5.002). This finding persisted on propensity scoring/matching. Multivariate analysis for autoSCT patients identified age > 60 years and > 3 prior therapies as adverse factors. Furthermore, a survival model was created for the autoSCT cohort
based on number of factors present (0, 1, 2); 3-year failure-free survival was 72%, 47%, and 20%, respectively (P 5.0003), and 3-year
overall survival was 96%, 82%, and 62%, respectively (P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: AutoSCT remains an effective therapy for patients

INTRODUCTION
Autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) and allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) have been shown to be effective therapeutic modalities for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL).1-5 However, most patients in these analyses did not
have disease that was relapsed or refractory after prior rituximab-based therapy prior to SCT. Recent data from diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma showed that outcomes with autoSCT for relapsed/refractory disease were poor, especially among
patients who relapsed after prior rituximab-containing therapy.6 The impact of prior treatment with rituximab, if any, on
the outcomes and prognostication of patients with relapsed/refractory FL who undergo subsequent SCT is not clear.
There has been an increasing use of alloSCT for relapsed/refractory FL, in part due to the use of reduced-intensity
conditioning, which allows older and/or less physically fit patients to undergo alloSCT. Early nonrelapse mortality
(NRM) is reduced with reduced-intensity alloSCT strategies, although there remains a lack of data studying longer-term
outcomes, especially late toxicity and mortality. In addition, there is a paucity of data in the contemporary era comparing

autoSCT versus alloSCT in relapsed/refractory FL. There
are no available randomized trials comparing these modalities. Moreover, a recent clinical trial attempting to examine this question closed prematurely due to poor accrual.7
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Outcomes
Database is a prospective cohort study examining comprehensive clinical, treatment, and outcomes data for patients
with NHL at 7 NCCN centers. This data set is a unique
resource collecting prospective data with relatively large
numbers of patients over long periods. The aim of the current analysis was to examine and compare the outcomes of
patients with FL with relapsed or refractory disease after
prior rituximab-based therapy who underwent either an
autoSCT or alloSCT. Furthermore, prognostic factors
predictive of survival within each SCT cohort, and across
all patients, were investigated. To our knowledge, this is
the largest report of SCT for FL relapsed/refractory after
prior rituximab treatment.

Statistical Analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

We identified all cases in the NCCN NHL database of
relapsed or refractory FL who had been treated with prior
(and relapsed from) rituximab and who received subsequent autoSCT or alloSCT. Patients who received > 1
SCT were excluded. The NCCN database prospectively
collects detailed NHL-specific data including patient and
disease characteristics, treatment, and outcomes.8,9 The
intent of the NCCN cohort study is to capture all patients
with NHL who were treated at these participating centers.
Among all NHL subjects in the database (N 5 5395),
1670 had FL, of whom 240 underwent one SCT during
the study observation period of January 1, 2001, through
December 31, 2009 (follow-up through May 11, 2012).
All SCTs were performed at an NCCN center. Quality
assurance review was performed for all cases; after quality
assurance review, we identified cases that did not meet the
predefined study criteria: did not have FL at transplant
(ie, transformed lymphoma, N 5 22), did not have
relapsed/refractory FL (ie, SCT done in first response/
remission, N 5 13), did not receive prior rituximab
(N 5 11), patient had undergone > 1 SCT (N 5 9), or
disease was not FL (N 5 1). In total, 184 patients were
included in the final analysis. Table 1 depicts the disease
status at presentation to the respective NCCN center.

Definitions in the database included scoring of comorbidities according to the Charlson comorbidity index,
whereas resistant disease (prior to SCT) included patients
without partial or complete response to salvage therapy.
Relapse after SCT was defined as progressive disease (PD)
from remission. Progression was defined as PD after SCT
without entering remission. Failure-free survival (FFS)
was defined as time from SCT to relapse, transformation,
PD, or death. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time in
years from SCT to death. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between autoSCT and
alloSCT cohorts, using chi-square test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum for medians. Based on
cause of death, cumulative incidence curves were generated to compare treatment-related mortality and nonrelapse mortality between type of SCT. P values were
calculated using Gray’s test for equality.10-12
Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was
used to assess associations of prognostic factors within
each SCT cohort for survival. Variables with P < .20 were
entered into a multivariate Cox model within each type of
SCT. In a similar fashion, Cox regression was used to
assess FFS and OS comparing autoSCT versus alloSCT
cohorts. To further examine differences in OS, a matched
cohort survival analysis using propensity scores was performed.13 Logistic regression was used to calculate each
patient’s propensity score, estimating the likelihood of
receiving an alloSCT conditioned upon the observed
3663

covariates. AlloSCT patients were exactly matched (without replacement) to an autoSCT patient to the 10th decimal place of the propensity score on a 1:1 basis. Cox
proportional hazards regression was performed with stratification on the propensity score (rounded to the 10th
place) to account for the matching nature of the data.14
Finally, based on the number of significant prognostic factors identified in the multivariate Cox model for the
autoSCT cohort, a survival model was created using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. The presence of each prognostic factor was given a value of 1
point, and the sum of all factors present was taken as the
patient’s final score. Kaplan-Meier survival plots were
generated by stratification on the final scores. All analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.2 software.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

There were several differences in patient and disease characteristics between the autoSCT and alloSCT cohorts
(Table 2). Patients who received autoSCT were significantly older at time of SCT compared with the alloSCT
cohort, whereas alloSCT patients had received a higher
number of therapies prior to SCT compared with
autoSCT patients. However, the overall use of rituximab
prior to SCT appeared similar. For patients who had
autoSCT and alloSCT, the mean number of rituximab/
chemotherapy regimens were 1.41 (0-3) and 1.47 (0-4),
respectively, and the mean number in whom rituximab
was used alone were 0.59 (0-2) and 0.90 (0-3), respectively. Immediately prior to SCT, rituximab was a part of
salvage therapy in 27% and 45% of autoSCT and
alloSCT patients, respectively (P 5 .03). There were no
differences between SCT groups identified for race, sex,
insurance, comorbidities, participation in a clinical trial,
or performance status. Further, the median time from
original FL diagnosis to SCT was 26 months (range, 6207 months) for patients who underwent autoSCT compared with 36 months (range, 8-178 months) for those
who underwent alloSCT (P 5 .13).

Transplant Information

A total of 96% of patients had peripheral stem cell collection, whereas 3% had bone marrow harvest, and 1% had
combined peripheral blood with marrow. Among patients
who underwent alloSCT, 63% had a matched-sibling donor, whereas 37% had a matched-unrelated donor.
Eighty-six percent had peripheral blood stem cell collection, 8% were from umbilical cord, and 6% were from
bone marrow. Further details regarding donor status (eg,
human leukocyte antigen match/mismatch, cytomegalovirus status, and the like) were not available. The conditioning regimens for patients who underwent autoSCT
were cyclophosphamide, bis-chloro-ethylnitrosourea
(BCNU), and etoposide (CBV)-based in 52%, BCNU,
etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) for 28%,
total body irradiation (TBI)-based in 18% (cyclophosphamide/etoposide with TBI most common), and 2% having
other regimens. For alloSCT patients, conditioning regimens were fludarabine/melphalan in 31%, TBI-based for
29% (fludarabine-TBI and cyclophosphamide-TBI being
most common), busulfan/fludarabine for 23%, and 17%
having other regimens. Dosing of conditioning therapy or
graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis was not available.
Survival

Median follow-up among surviving patients from the date
of SCT to last known vital status was 4.0 years with a
range of < 1 to 10 years. Table 3 shows outcomes according to type of SCT. The proportion of patients whose first
event experienced during follow-up was progression,
relapse, and/or transformation was 32% for the autoSCT
cohort compared with 17% for patients who underwent
alloSCT (P 5 .03). The only difference among patients
who experienced disease progression versus those who did
not, besides type of SCT, was older age (ie, median age
56.4 versus 52.4 years, respectively, P 5 .01). There was
no appreciable difference in FFS (Fig. 1A); however, the
3-year OS was superior for the autoSCT cohort compared
with alloSCT patients (Fig. 1B).
Causes of Death

Disease Status

AutoSCT patients were more likely to have grade 3 FL
compared with the alloSCT cohort. Analyzed as a continuous variable and grouped (ie, stage I/II versus stage III/
IV), there were no differences in disease stage at relapse
(prior to SCT) between the 2 cohorts (Table 2). Subjects
who underwent alloSCT, however, more commonly had
resistant disease at the time of SCT compared with
patients who underwent autoSCT.
3664

Nineteen percent of autoSCT and 43% of alloSCT subjects have died. Among the 26 deaths in the autoSCT
cohort, 18 (69%) were due to PD compared with 8 due to
PD of 21 (38%) deaths in alloSCT subjects. Interestingly,
the 100-day NRM rates for autoSCT and alloSCT
patients were 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 0.1%4%) and 6% (95% CI 5 2%-16%), respectively (overall
P < .0001 Gray’s test for equality), whereas the 3-year
NRM rates were 3% (95% CI 5 1%-8%) for autoSCT

autoSCT cohort based on the presence of a single prognostic factor (identified on multivariate analysis). Furthermore, a CART survival model was formed for the
autoSCT cohort using these prognostic covariates (Fig.
3A,B). The impact of each adverse risk factor appeared to
be approximately equal based on the similar OS and FFS
univariate hazard ratios. An increasing number of these 2
independent variables (ie, age  60 years and > 3 prior
therapies) was associated with divergent survival rates as
noted in Figure 3A,B.
Within the alloSCT cohort, there were no significant prognostic factors identified on univariate analysis.
On multivariate Cox regression analysis, age and number

disease emerged as prognostic factors for the alloSCT
cohort (Table 6). Time from original FL diagnosis to
SCT was not predictive of FFS or OS (data not shown).
Outcomes Comparing AutoSCT Versus AlloSCT

Cox regression multivariate analysis was performed across
all patients (N 5 184) in order to compare survival for
autoSCT versus alloSCT cohorts (Table 7). After controlling for significant competing factors including increasing
age (analyzed as continuous and dichotomous variable),
resistant disease at time of SCT, and number of prior
therapies, alloSCT remained associated with a significantly increased risk of death compared with autoSCT
(Table 5). The risk of death remained increased with
alloSCT when FL grade 3 patients were excluded (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.66, 95% CI 5 1.37-5.17,
P 5 .004), which persisted on multivariate analysis (data
not shown). It is important to note, however, that this
group of patients was small and there were no data delineating grade 3a versus 3b. Patients were also matched
exactly with propensity scoring on age, number of prior
therapies, and disease resistance at time of SCT. The risk
of death with alloSCT remained more than twice that for
autoSCT. Figure 3C shows the Kaplan-Meier OS plot for
the matched cohort (on propensity analysis) comparing
autoSCT with alloSCT. Among the 49 alloSCT patients,
3 had unknown disease status at SCT and were excluded
from the matching process, whereas an additional 3
alloSCT patients were unable to have a matching autologous SCT patient found, leaving 86 patients in total (ie,
43 matched pairs) for the final matched propensity
analysis.

DISCUSSION
This analysis reports the outcomes and associated prognostic factors among a large cohort of relapsed/refractory
FL subjects who underwent autoSCT or alloSCT after
relapse from prior rituximab. To our knowledge, this is
the largest report of SCT for relapsed/refractory FL in the
post-rituximab era. Comparing autoSCT and alloSCT,
we noted no difference in FFS; however, we found that
the 3-year OS was superior for autoSCT versus alloSCT
patients. Moreover, the OS advantage for autoSCT persisted on multivariate Cox regression and propensity scoring analyses. In addition, we identified key prognostic
factors within each SCT cohort. In interpreting these
observations, several factors should be considered.
Outcomes with autoSCT for relapsed/refractory FL
have been reported.1-3,5,15-20 However, these analyses
consisted primarily of patients treated in single-institution
series, and most were in the pre-rituximab era. Because rituximab is now included as a component of frontline therapy in the vast majority of patients with FL, it is of major
interest to examine SCT-related outcomes for relapsed/refractory patients who have progressed after treatment with
(failure from) prior rituximab-based therapy. There is currently minimal available data toward this end. A study by
Le Gouill et al examined FL subjects in first relapse following treatment on the front-line FL2000 study.21 They
demonstrated excellent outcomes among relapsed FL subjects who underwent autoSCT, with 3-year OS of 92%
versus 63% for patients who did not undergo autoSCT;
the OS advantage persisted on multivariate analysis. However, of the 42 subjects who underwent autoSCT, only 13
had relapsed from/after rituximab-based therapy. In a retrospective series, Kang et al compared 35 patients with

Figure 1. Nonrelapse mortality and survival are shown. Graph
(A) shows the cumulative nonrelapse mortality rates for autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) and allogeneic SCT
(alloSCT), and (B) shows the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier failurefree survival (FFS) for autologous SCT versus allogeneic SCT
(N 5 184). The 3-year FFS for autologous SCT patients was 57%
(95% CI 5 47%-66%) versus 52% (95% CI 5 36%-67%) for allogeneic SCT (FFS log-rank P 5.14). (C) shows the unadjusted
overall survival (OS) for autologous SCT versus allogeneic SCT
(N 5 184). The 3-year OS for autologous SCT was 87% (95%
CI 5 81%-94%) versus 61% (95% CI 5 47%-76%) for allogeneic
SCT patients (OS log-rank P <.0001).

and OS were similar. We identified here a 3-year FFS of
56% and 3-year OS of 86% for 135 relapsed/refractory
FL patients who received autoSCT, all of whom had
relapsed after treatment with prior rituximab. These outcomes appear comparable with prior autoSCT reports,
including ones with rituximab-naive populations.
Among recent alloSCT reports for relapsed/refractory FL, the 4- to 5-year OS rates were 57% to 85%,
whereas the NRM rates ranged from 15% to 35%23-25;

35% to 74% of patients in these series had received rituximab prior to SCT. The 3-year OS for the alloSCT cohort
in the current report was 63%. Moreover, a surprising
finding in the current data was the superior OS documented for relapsed/refractory FL subjects who received
autoSCT compared with those who received alloSCT.
The reason for this difference is not known, but several
explanations are possible.
Many alloSCT procedures today are based on a
reduced intensity platform, which allows older and/or less
physically fit patients to undergo this therapy. The conditioning regimens for alloSCT in this study were heterogenous, although most appeared consistent with reducedintensity conditioning. Reduced-intensity conditioning
regimens are typically associated with lower rates of early
TRM (ie, 100-day); however, as our data show, there was
a later and continual risk of death while in remission for
patients who underwent alloSCT. In addition, it may not
be possible for nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens
to overcome refractory/resistant disease in select cases.
Interestingly, resistant disease did not predict FFS or OS
within the autoSCT cohort; however, that subset represented a minority of subjects and thus may not have been
3668

powered to detect a difference. The higher risk features of
alloSCT patients in the current analyses (eg, more prior
therapy and resistant disease) likely contributed to the
poorer outcome. Yet, the inferior survival for alloSCT
persisted after adjustment for these competing risk factors
(ie, resistant disease, number of prior therapies, and age)
on multivariate Cox regression analysis as well as on exact
matching through propensity scoring analysis.
The NCCN Outcomes database is a multicenter
research effort prospectively collecting data from 7 participating NCCN centers. These centers are National Cancer
Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers,
each with expertise in SCT. Further, a significant strength
of this data is all patients diagnosed and treated with
NHL at these centers were included in the database
regardless of patient/disease characteristics or therapy
administered. Despite the shortcomings of this report,
such as lack of treatment details and nonuniform therapy,
it is able to overcome inherent limitations associated with
single-center SCT reports. Furthermore, subjects are
tracked prospectively for potential late effects, including
nonlymphoma events. We identified several late nonrelapse deaths among alloSCT subjects, including deaths

more than 5 years after SCT. It is not clear if the impact of
prior therapies received, including rituximab therapy/failure, may adversely affect outcomes associated with
alloSCT. Longer term follow-up will be essential in this
data set in confirming the OS advantage identified for the
autoSCT cohort and whether a plateau will persist on
either of the survival curves. It is also important to
acknowledge that despite the prospective cohort data collection and the detailed statistical methodology used here,
there may still be unintended biases that affected these
data.

Figure 3. Survival models are presented. Panels (A) and (B)
show the CART survival model formed for autologous stem
cell transplantation (SCT) patients using the 2 significant factors identified in multivariate analysis in this cohort: 3-year
failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) for
patients who underwent autologous SCT based on the number of the adverse prognostic factors present (ie, age > 60
years and > 3 prior therapies). An increasing number of
adverse factors portended an increasingly poor outcome: 3year FFS with 0, 1, or 2 factors: 72% (95% confidence interval
[CI] 5 60%-84%), 47% (95% CI 5 32%-61%), and 20% (95%
CI 5 4%-45%), respectively (FFS log-rank P 5.0003); and the
associated 3-year OS rates were 96% (95% CI 5 91%-101%),
82% (95% CI 5 71%-94%), and 62% (95% CI 5 32%-92%),
respectively (OS log-rank P <.0001). (C) shows the KaplanMeier OS figure for the exact matched cohort (on propensity
matching analysis) comparing autologous SCT with allogeneic SCT. The 3-year OS on this matched analysis was 85%
(95% CI 5 73%-97%) for autologous SCT versus 63% (95%
CI 5 47%-79%) for allogeneic SCT (P 5.011).

The data presented here do not address the role of
whether SCT should be recommended in relapsed/refractory FL, which is an important consideration. However,
when SCT is performed, we identified several critical
prognostic factors that predicted survival within the
autoSCT and alloSCT cohorts. Furthermore, we created a
novel prognostic survival model for patients with
relapsed/refractory FL in the post-rituximab era. We also
found that autoSCT and alloSCT were associated with
comparable FFS. However, including adjustment for
competing prognostic factors on multivariate analysis and
propensity score analysis, OS was superior among
relapsed/refractory FL patients who underwent autoSCT
compared with alloSCT. Based on these data, we conclude that autoSCT remains an effective therapy for
3670

relapsed/refractory FL in the post-rituximab era. For
high-risk patients with FL who are considered for
alloSCT, continued strategies to reduce NRM are needed.
