Abstract
Most colorectal cancers (CRC) are initiated by mutations of APC, leading to increased b-catenin–mediated
signaling. However, continued requirement of Wnt/b-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context
of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/b-catenin signaling in
tumors, we have developed potent and speciﬁc small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM,
that reduce Wnt/b-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation,
thereby promoting b-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block
ligand-driven Wnt/b-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC
mutation–driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN
protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufﬁcient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal
APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor
growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase
inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces
differentiation, suggesting that b-catenin–dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be
blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited
by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal
crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efﬁcacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant
CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are
advanced into the clinic. Cancer Res; 73(10); 3132–44. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Despite detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and long-standing knowledge
of highly prevalent Wnt pathway activation in colorectal
cancers (CRC), no targeted therapeutics have advanced to
clinical testing for APC-mutant CRCs, although Wnt pathway
inhibitors have entered clinical trials for other indications (1,
2). The cellular level of transcriptional coactivator b-catenin is
regulated by its destruction through b-TrCP–dependent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (3). b-Catenin is

stabilized in approximately 75% of colorectal tumors by inactivating mutations in the destruction complex scaffolding
protein APC and in an additional 5% by phosphodegron
mutations in b-catenin (4, 5). These mutations likely initiate
tumor development as they arise at the microadenoma stage,
whereas mutations in additional oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including KRAS, p53, and SMAD4, are found in larger
adenomas and adenocarcinomas (4, 6). Mouse Apc deletion
speciﬁcally in Lgr5þ intestinal stem cells produces neoplasia
(7). In mouse small intestine, ligand-induced Wnt/b-catenin
signaling in intestinal stem cells maintains multipotent stem
cell self-renewal (8). In an analogous fashion in a mouse
inducible Apc deletion model of intestinal cancer, Lgr5þ adenoma cells constitute 5% to 10% of tumor cells and give rise to
additional stem cell–like cancer cells as well as differentiated
cell types (9).
Even with the subsequent accumulation of mutations in
other pathways during intestinal tumor progression, at least
some CRC models maintain a continued requirement for
activated Wnt/b-catenin signaling. b-catenin mediates cell
proliferation in established CRC cell lines, such that b-catenin
knockdown inhibits colony formation and induce G1 cell-cycle
arrest (10–12). Furthermore, in APC- or b-catenin–mutant
xenograft tumor models, reduction of b-catenin expression
can inhibit tumor growth (12–14). Importantly, the antitumor

Tankyrase Inhibitor Suppresses Colorectal Tumor Growth

efﬁcacy of inducible b-catenin RNA interference (RNAi) is
associated with an induction of biomarkers for intestinal
cell–type differentiation and cell-cycle arrest (13). However,
b-catenin is not required for cell proliferation and tumor
growth in all APC-mutant CRC models, and the determinants
of these differential requirements have not been deﬁned.
The scaffolding protein AXIN is the concentration-limiting
component of the b-catenin destruction complex (15). AXIN1
and AXIN2 protein levels are constitutively suppressed through
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARsylation) by tankyrases TNKS1
and TNKS2 (16), which directs AXIN ubiquitylation by RNF146
and proteasomal degradation (17, 18). Cell-based screens for
Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibition have identiﬁed small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors that block PARsylation activity
(16, 19–25). Tankyrase inhibitors stabilize AXIN by preventing
its PARsylation and ubiquitylation, thereby enhancing b-catenin degradation (16). Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibition by
tankyrase inhibitors appears to be complete for cell lines that
contain wild-type APC and are stimulated with exogenous Wnt
(16, 19, 21–23). However, the extent of signaling inhibition in
APC- and b-catenin–mutant cells has not been surveyed in a
systematic way for CRC cell lines' and inhibition levels as well
as cell survival and proliferation effects appear to differ
between tankyrase inhibitors, possibly due to off-target effects.
With the identiﬁcation of a readily druggable target in the
Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway that acts at the level of
b-catenin degradation, it now becomes important to establish whether tankyrase inhibitors exhibit antitumor efﬁcacy
in preclinical CRC models in vivo. Initial results in genetically
engineered mouse Apc-mutant models suggest that adenoma formation may be prevented or slowed (21, 22). In
addition, the therapeutic window of tankyrase inhibitors
will need to be deﬁned as potent inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling in intestine produces signiﬁcant adverse effects
(26, 27). Here, we show that tankyrase inhibitors optimized
for potency, selectivity, and in vivo stability can sufﬁciently
stabilize AXIN to reduce Wnt/b-catenin signaling and xenograft tumor growth of a subset of APC-mutant CRC cell lines.
Our studies also reveal intrinsic resistance to inhibition of
Wnt/b-catenin signaling and tumor growth by tankyrase
inhibitors in some CRC models, as well as intestinal toxicity
for doses near the high end of the efﬁcacious concentration
range.

Materials and Methods
Cell and biochemical assays
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection, cultured according to the supplier's recommendations, and validated for APC genotype by sequencing. TOPbrite
and SV40 luciferase reporter cell lines and assays for luciferase
activity, cell viability, and proliferation were reported previously (17, 28). RNAi and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) expression analysis was carried out as described previously (17).
Intestinal crypt organoids were isolated and cultured as previously described (29). Tankyrase auto-PARsylation and PARP
histone PARsylation biochemical assays were conducted in
duplicate by BPS Bioscience following the BPS PARP Assay Kit
protocols.

Mouse in vivo studies
For pharmacokinetic analysis, three CD-1 mice were each
given a single 1 mg/kg i.v. dose [vehicle: 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), 60% PEG400, 30% saline] or 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal
(i.p.) dose (vehicle: 15% DMSO, 17.5% Cremophor EL, 8.75%
ethanol, 8.75% Miglyol 810N, 50% PBS) of G007-LK or G244-LM.
In the toxicology study, G007-LK was administered at doses of
0, 60, and 100 mg/kg to female CD-1 mice (6 per group) i.p. once
daily for 14 days.
For xenograft tumor studies, mice were implanted subcutaneously with cells and groups of 10 animals were administered G007-LK i.p. as described in Supplementary Materials
and Methods. Male ApcCKO/CKO/Lgr5-creERT2 mice at 10 weeks
of age were injected i.p. with 1.5 mg/kg of tamoxifen (Sigma)
diluted in ethanol and corn oil (ratio 1:4) and randomized into
2 groups of 5 animals for G007-LK treatment.
Tumor RNA and protein expression analyses
Tumor RNA and protein lysates were prepared as described
in Supplementary Materials and Methods. All genes used to
evaluate Wnt/b-catenin signaling in tumors and cell lines were
validated by qPCR using b-catenin RNAi in the respective cell
line in culture.

Results
Tankyrase inhibitors reduce Wnt/b-catenin signaling in
a subset of APC-mutant CRC cell lines
Through structure–activity relationship studies to be published elsewhere, we developed analogues of TNKS1/2 smallmolecule inhibitors in 2 distinct chemical series possessing
signiﬁcantly enhanced potency for Wnt/b-catenin signaling
inhibition in cell-based assays, relative to previously published
inhibitors (Fig. 1A and 1B; Supplementary Table S1). G007-LK is
an analogue of JW74 (21), which binds the adenosine site of the
tankyrase NADþ-binding pocket (25), and G244-LM is an
analogue of XAV939 (16), which binds the nicotinamide site
of the pocket (20). Tankyrases are members of the PARP
superfamily that encompasses 15 other enzymes with a conserved catalytic domain (30). In biochemical assays of autoPARslyation activity, G007-LK is more selective than a G244LM analogue or XAV939 in inhibiting TNKS1/2 relative to the 7
PARP enzymes tested (Supplementary Table S1). G007-LK and
G244-LM completely inhibit Wnt3a-induced signaling in
human HEK293 (Fig. 1B) and mouse 10T1/2 (Supplementary
Fig. S1A) cells as assayed by a T-cell factor (TCF)-driven
luciferase reporter (TOPbrite) and also by endogenous expression of Wnt/b-catenin target genes in 10T1/2 cells. Both
inhibitors only partially reduce (by 50%) b-catenin signaling
driven by APC mutation in the CRC cell line HCT-15, as
measured by either the Wnt/b-catenin signaling reporter or
endogenous target gene expression (Fig. 1B), whereas b-catenin RNAi nearly completely inhibits signaling (Fig. 1C). When
activity levels of b-catenin in HCT-15 cells are lowered by
b-catenin siRNA at limiting concentrations, G244-LM treatment additively blocks Wnt/b-catenin signaling (Fig. 1C). At all
levels of partial b-catenin knockdown, tankyrase inhibition
produced 30% to 56% inhibition of the remaining Wnt/b-catenin signaling reporter or AXIN2 mRNA expression.

proteins (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast to the
other cell lines, 2 lines that are resistant to Wnt/b-catenin
signaling inhibition by tankyrase inhibitors exhibited stabilization of only one AXIN isoform: AXIN2 but not AXIN1 for
COLO-205 cells and AXIN1 but not AXIN2 in LS-411N cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). G007-LK reduces cytosolic and
nuclear b-catenin protein levels in all the APC-mutant cell
lines in which it inhibits Wnt/b-catenin signaling and also in
SW480 cells, but not in the resistant cell lines COLO-205, HT29, or LS-411N (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Quantitating
nuclear nonphospho-b-catenin by immunoﬂuorescence
reveals that tankyrase inhibitors reduce levels in SW480 cells
by up to 48%, similar to the maximal 42% inhibition observed in
COLO-320DM cells that are sensitive to tankyrase inhibitors for
Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibition (Fig. 2C). In CRC cells lines
LS174T and HCT116 with phosphodegron mutations in b-catenin, G007-LK does not detectably destabilize cytoplasmic or
nuclear b-catenin protein (Fig. 2B).

In cell-based assays, we observed no signiﬁcant inhibition of
cell proliferation or viability with tankyrase inhibitor treatment
of CRC lines up to 24 hours (Fig. 1B), as well as no induction of
the apoptosis markers BIM gene expression (Supplementary
Fig. S2C) and caspase-3/7 activities (data not shown). However,
cell-cycle analysis revealed that G007-LK and G244-LM

reduced the number of COLO-320DM cells in mitosis from
24% to 12% and decreased HCT-15 cells in S-phase from 28% to
18% (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We selected 4 APC-mutant CRC
cells lines that were sensitive to inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling by tankyrase inhibitors for further characterization of
effects on growth using colony formation assays and prolonged
compound treatment. COLO-320DM and SW403 cells, but not
HCT-15 or DLD-1 cells, showed inhibition of colony formation
with either G007-LK or G244-LM (Fig. 3A). Wnt target gene
expression analysis indicated that Wnt/b-catenin signaling
inhibition was maintained through the end of the treatment
in COLO-320DM and HCT-15 cells (Fig. 3B). Intestinal differentiation marker cytokeratin 20 (KRT20) expression was
induced in both COLO-320DM and HCT-15 cells; however,
speciﬁc markers for enterocyte (CA2) or enterocyte and goblet
cell (TM4SF4) differentiation (13) display increased expression
in COLO-320DM but not HCT-15 cells (Fig. 3B).
As many CRC cell lines exhibit activated receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) signaling, we tested whether tankyrase and RTK
signaling inhibitors could act additively or synergistically in
combination. In 4-day treatment assays, we observed very
weak enhancement of the effects of MEK1/2 inhibitor GDC0973 (31) by tankyrase inhibitors on DLD-1 (Supplementary
Fig. S2B) and HCT-15 (data not shown) cell proliferation. These
interactions were more pronounced in colony formation
assays with long-term compound treatment (Fig. 3C). In
KRAS-mutant DLD-1 and HCT-15 cells, tankyrase inhibitors
further reduced the number of colonies formed in the presence

of GDC-0973 by 28% to 64%. These effects were associated with
increased expression of intestinal differentiation markers such
as KRT20 (Fig. 3C) but did not correlate with either enhanced
expression of apoptosis marker BIM or with MEK inhibitor
effects on b-catenin–regulated gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Tankyrase and MEK inhibitors additively
enhanced the reduction in colony formation by either treatment alone in KRAS-mutant SW403 cells (Fig. 3C). COLO320DM cells lacking RTK pathway mutations were insensitive
to GDC-0973, and MEK inhibition did not further enhance the
reduction of colony formation by tankyrase inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Growth of mouse intestinal organoids cultured ex vivo
requires exogenously supplied R-spondin (for Wnt/b-catenin
signaling ampliﬁcation) and EGF (29). Organoid growth is
suppressed by tankyrase inhibitors G007-LK and G244-LM
with IC50 values of 0.08 and 0.11 mmol/L, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Organoids cultured from ApcMin mouse
small intestine adenomas are constitutively activated for Wnt/
b-catenin signaling, thereby bypassing the requirement for Rspondin, and grow mostly as spheroid cysts devoid of differentiated cell types and containing a central ﬂuid-ﬁlled lumen
(8). Tankyrase inhibitors blocked growth of spheroids with this
morphology (Fig. 3D). Inhibition of tankyrase in ApcMin spheroids also reduced expression of Wnt target gene Ascl2 and
induced expression of intestinal cell–type differentiation markers Fabp2 for enterocytes and Tff3 for goblet cells (Fig. 3E).
Interestingly, spheroids with lumens ﬁlled with apparently
apoptotic cells (29) seemed to increase in size with tankyrase
inhibitor treatment, consistent with the induction of differentiated cells that are eventually shed into the central lumen. In
contrast, EGFR inhibitor erlotinib reduced the number of
spheroids with both lumen morphologies (Fig. 3D).
G007-LK exhibits antitumor efﬁcacy in xenograft and
genetically engineered CRC models
Pharmacokinetic analysis in mice indicates that G007-LK
administered i.p. at a dose of 5 mg/kg yields compound
exposure in blood above 1 mmol/L for 9 hours whereas
G244-LM is much less metabolically stable (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S2). A single 50 mg/kg i.p. dose of G007-LK in
mice maintained compound exposure in plasma and HCT-15
cell xenograft tumors at greater than 0.5 mmol/L for at least 16
hours (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and also stabilized AXIN1 and
AXIN2 proteins in tumors for at least 24 hours (Fig. 4B). Wnt
transcriptional target genes were also regulated in tumors by
the compound at these time points (Fig. 4C).
We have tested 4 xenograft models of APC-mutant CRC cell
lines that are sensitive to inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling
pharmacodynamic markers by G007-LK in cell culture and
ﬁnd that 2 models show antitumor efﬁcacy. In the COLO320DM model, xenograft tumors showed G007-LK concentration-dependent growth inhibition with either daily or twice
daily dosing (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Table S3). Percent body
weight loss for these mice remained above 10% at doses up to
20 mg/kg twice daily or 40 mg/kg daily, at which concentrations we achieved 61% and 48% tumor growth inhibition,
respectively (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Table S3). In COLO-

3138

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

320DM tumors at 21 days of treatment, TNKS1 and TNKS2
protein levels were reduced, AXIN1 and AXIN2 were stabilized,
and b-catenin level was decreased (Fig. 4E). For 4 tankyrase
substrates other than AXIN1/2 (32–34), no consistent change in
protein levels was seen in treated COLO-320DM tumors (Fig.
4E). Also, the Axin-bTrCP substrate plakoglobin (35) was not
altered by G007-LK treatment in COLO-320DM tumors (Fig. 4E).
Wnt/b-catenin signaling was clearly inhibited in a dosedependent manner in the efﬁcacy study tumors as indicated by
reduced expression of b-catenin–activated genes NKD1,
APCDD1, and TNFRSF19 (TROY), as well as increased expression of b-catenin–repressed gene CLIC3 (Fig. 4F). Consistent
with induction of intestinal cell differentiation mediating
tumor growth inhibition, G007-LK treatment increased expression of KRT20 and TM4SF4 in COLO-320DM tumors (Fig. 4F).
Some markers for enterocyte differentiation (VIL1, CAMP)
were induced, whereas others were repressed (FABP2, ALPI)
or unchanged (CA2, LCT; Fig. 4F and data not shown). None of
the goblet or enteroendocrine cell differentiation markers
tested showed a change in expression levels in G007-LK–
treated tumors (data not shown).
G007-LK also showed antitumor efﬁcacy for SW403 cell
xenografts in mice treated either daily or twice daily, with up
to 71% tumor growth inhibition at doses that produce less than
10% change in body weight (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table
S3). In treated SW403 tumors at the end of the study, AXIN1
and AXIN2 proteins were stabilized (Fig. 5B), and Wnt/b-catenin signaling was inhibited on the basis of the regulation of
Wnt target genes validated in SW403 cells in culture by
b-catenin RNAi (Fig. 5C). In the genetically engineered mouse
model ApcCKO/CKO Lgr5-CreERT2, excision of a ﬂoxed Apc allele
truncates the protein at codon 580, producing multiple adenomas when Cre recombinase expression in Lgr5þ cells is
activated by tamoxifen (22). G007-LK dosed at 50 mg/kg daily
from the day after tamoxifen treatment reduced the size and
multiplicity of adenomas in the small intestine that expressed
high levels of b-catenin (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C).
In contrast to the antitumor efﬁcacy observed for G007-LK
in COLO-320DM and SW403 xenograft models, HCT-15 and
DLD-1 tumors were not sensitive to tumor growth inhibition
by the tankyrase inhibitor administered daily (Fig. 5D) or twice
daily (data not shown), even though compound exposure in
plasma and tumors was similar in all of the efﬁcacy studies
(Supplementary Fig. S3D). Despite the lack of antitumor activity, inhibition of expression of Wnt target genes AXIN2 and
APCDD1, as well as induction of intestinal differentiation
markers KRT20, TM4SF4, and FABP2 was observed in HCT15 xenografts (Fig. 5E).
Tankyrase inhibition reduces Wnt/b-catenin signaling
and cell proliferation in normal intestine
As Wnt/b-catenin signaling maintains tissue homeostasis in
the intestine, we examined the small intestine of mice treated
with tankyrase inhibitor for 21 days in the COLO-320DM
xenograft tumor efﬁcacy study. G007-LK inhibited the intestinal Wnt-activated expression of genes Axin2, Lgr5, and Olfm4
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The cell proliferation
marker Ki67 mRNA displayed reduced expression only at the

Ki67 protein expression at crypt bases was reduced or lost in
some regions of the small intestine, even though the tissue
architecture was generally preserved, at least in mice that
survived to the end of the study (Fig. 6B).
To determine the mechanism of toxicity, we administered
high concentrations of G007-LK to non–tumor-bearing mice
and carried out histopathology and clinical pathology analyses
when mice started to become moribund (10 days at 60 mg/kg
i.p. daily or 9 days at 100 mg/kg i.p. daily). Severe necrosis and
inﬂammation of the small intestine was determined to be the
cause of moribundity and death. Intestinal epithelial degeneration and sloughing with villus blunting and crypt loss was
apparent in the small intestine, especially the ileum (Fig. 6C;
Supplementary Fig. S4A). A systemic inﬂammatory response to
epithelial barrier disruption was measured by increased absolute neutrophil count and band neutrophil percentage, as well

Discussion
Almost all colorectal tumors carry mutations in APC or
b-catenin that lead to activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling (4,
5), and many CRC cell lines and tumor models maintain a
requirement for activated b-catenin signaling for growth (10–
14). Tankyrase is currently the most highly validated druggable
target in the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway that acts at the
level of b-catenin stability or function such that inhibitors
reduce signaling driven by APC mutations. Previously reported
tankyrase inhibitors have not been deﬁnitively shown to be
metabolically stable (16, 19, 21–23), and in vivo antitumor
efﬁcacy of tankyrase inhibitors in human CRC models has
hitherto not been presented. The potent and selective TNKS1/2
inhibitor G007-LK used in the current studies shows greater in
vivo stability than previously reported inhibitors, and sufﬁcient
bioavailability to downregulate Wnt/b-catenin signaling in

CRC xenograft tumors. We show G007-LK tumor growth
inhibition in 2 APC-mutant CRC xenograft models, as well as
in a genetically engineered mouse Apc mutant model, supporting therapeutic efﬁcacy of tankyrase inhibitors for Wnt pathway mutation–driven cancer.
Whereas tankyrase inhibitors completely blocked Wnt
ligand–induced signaling in cells with wild-type APC and
b-catenin, APC-mutant CRC cells lines that were sensitive to
tankyrase inhibitors showed only approximately 50% reduction in Wnt signaling relative to b-catenin RNAi. Therefore,
wild-type APC is likely required for the full b-catenin degrading
activity of the AXIN protein that is stabilized by tankyrase
inhibition. However, COLO-320DM cells are hemizygous for a
truncating APC mutation 50 to all known AXIN or b-catenin–
binding sites and lack APC activity as measured by APC RNAi,
yet they are sensitive to b-catenin degradation and inhibition
of Wnt/b-catenin signaling by tankyrase inhibitors. This suggests that full-length APC function may not be strictly required
for stabilized AXIN to degrade or sequester b-catenin. Five of
the 11 tested CRC cell lines mutant for APC are resistant to
Wnt/b-catenin signaling downregulation by tankyrase inhibitors, apparently through at least 2 mechanisms. G007-LK
stabilizes AXIN1/2 proteins in all cell lines tested, although
possibly to a lesser extent in resistant cell lines COLO-205 and
LS411N, but b-catenin protein levels are not reduced by G007LK in COLO-205, LS-411N, and HT-29 cells. In contrast, tankyrase inhibition reduces cytosolic and nuclear b-catenin
levels in SW480 cells. However b-catenin levels in untreated
SW480 cells are unusually high, and the remaining levels after
G007-LK treatment are still higher than in the other untreated
cell lines tested, possibly sufﬁciently elevated to maintain
activated Wnt/b-catenin signaling.
In contrast to the robust and rapid effects on cell proliferation in response to inhibition of RTK signaling, blocking
morphogen signaling pathways Wnt, Hedgehog, or Notch
generally produces more limited effects (12, 36, 37). However,
morphogen pathway inhibitors can still produce potent tumor
growth inhibition, in some cases due to effects on tumor cell
differentiation, tumor-associated stroma, or angiogenesis
(13, 36, 37). Tankyrase inhibitors induce expression of multiple
intestinal cell–type differentiation markers in COLO-320DM
and HCT-15 cells treated in culture or as xenograft tumors,
with some genes induced in only one or the other cell line that
might differentially impact growth. G007-LK–treated COLO320DM tumors are not induced for all markers tested of any
speciﬁc intestinal cell lineage, therefore speciﬁcation of a
normal differentiated cell type does not seem to account for
the inhibition of tumor growth. It will be important to establish
in tumors whether effects other than induction of intestinal
differentiation contribute to the antitumor efﬁcacy of tankyrase inhibitors.
In KRAS-mutant cell lines HCT-15 and DLD-1, tankyrase
inhibitors do not show single-agent activity for inhibition of
clonogenic cell growth. However, tankyrase inhibitors add to
the activity of a MEK inhibitor in reducing colony formation in
these cell lines. Interestingly, an activating KRAS mutation
increases adenoma multiplicity and accelerates tumor progression in Apc-mutant mice, possibly through enhancing

b-catenin transcriptional target gene regulation (38). Conversely, combined RNAi knockdown of b-catenin and KRAS
shows greater inhibition of CRC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth than RNAi of either single gene, as well as
induction of apoptosis (39). However, we observed MEK inhibitor enhancement of intestinal differentiation gene expression,
but not Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibition or apoptosis, by
tankyrase inhibitors. Tankyrase inhibition has previously been
shown to synergistically enhance EGFR inhibitors for cell
proliferation and tumor growth inhibition of non–small cell
lung cancer cell lines (40) and to potentiate phophoinositide 3kinase (PI3K) or AKT inhibitors for apoptosis induction in CRC
cell lines (41). Future drug combination tumor studies will
address whether this translates in vivo to a therapeutic beneﬁt
for tankyrase inhibitors in CRC models. In addition, deﬁning
determinants of resistance and sensitization to growth inhibition by tankyrase inhibitors will be critical in developing
predictive diagnostic biomarkers to realize the full therapeutic
potential of tankyrase inhibitors for cancer therapy.
G007-LK appears to exhibit a narrow efﬁcacious concentration range, as we observe 50% to 70% tumor growth
inhibition at 20 mg/kg twice daily (or 30–40 mg/kg daily)
for COLO-320DM and SW403 xenograft tumors with less
than 10% reduction in mouse body weight and signiﬁcant
toxicity at 30 mg/kg twice daily (or 60 mg/kg daily). The
dose-limiting toxicity precludes determining whether tankyrase inhibition can achieve tumor stasis or regression. The
epithelial degeneration and reduction of crypt proliferation
detected in the intestine appears to be the cause of moribundity and is likely an on-target effect of the observed Wnt/
b-catenin signaling inhibition in intestine. Ectopic expression of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling antagonist DKK1 can
also attenuate proliferation in intestinal crypts leading to
epithelial degeneration (26, 27). Interestingly, this effect is
reversible (27) and, in fact, complete ablation of Lgr5þ
intestinal stem cells can be tolerated without perturbing
the long-term homeostasis of the intestine as new Lgr5þ
stem cells appear to be generated from another cell population (42, 43). Future studies will need to address whether
the intestinal toxicity of tankyrase inhibitors can be reversible and manageable with intermittent dosing.
The durable effects of G007-LK in COLO-0320DM and
SW403 tumors on AXIN stabilization, b-catenin destabilization, and expression of b-catenin–regulated and intestinal
differentiation genes is consistent with a mechanism-based
tumor growth inhibition. Unexpectedly, we observed a greater
reduction in the expression of some b-catenin–activated genes
in tumor xenografts compared with cell culture lines treated
with G007-LK, possibly due to extended treatment duration.
However, intestinal antitumor efﬁcacy can be achieved in at
least the Apc1638N mouse model with only a 50% reduction in
Wnt/b-catenin signaling through knocking out a single b-catenin allele (44). In addition to AXIN, more than 10 substrates of
tankyrase have been identiﬁed (32–34). However, the steadystate levels of 4 tankyrase substrates other than AXIN (NuMA,
TRF1, IRAP, and CPAP/CENPJ) and 1 AXIN-b-TrCP substrate
other than b-catenin (plakoglobin) were not altered in end-ofstudy COLO-320DM xenograft tumors treated with tankyrase

inhibitor. The protein stability of TRF1 (32), CPAP (34), and
plakoglobin (35) has been shown to be regulated by tankyrasemediated PARsylation or AXIN-mediated ubiquitylation in
some cell lines, suggesting that not all tankyrase functions
may be preserved in CRC cells. As we have identiﬁed tumor
models whose growth is reduced by tankyrase inhibitors,
proof-of-mechanism studies can be initiated to show a causal
link between AXIN protein stabilization, b-catenin degradation, and growth inhibition.
