Abstract
Ongoing clinical trials are exploring anticancer approaches based on signaling by TRAIL, a ligand for the cell
death receptors DR4 and DR5. In this study, we report on the selective apoptotic effects of multivalent DR5
binding peptides (TRAILmim/DR5) on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Surface plasmon resonance revealed up to
several thousand-fold increased affinities of TRAILmim/DR5-receptor complexes on generation of divalent and
trivalent molecules, the latter of which was achieved with a conformationally restricted adamantane core.
Notably, only multivalent molecules triggered a substantial DR5-dependent apoptotic response in vitro. In
tumor models derived from human embryonic kidney cells or primary foreskin fibroblasts, TRAILmim/DR5
peptides exerted a cancer cell–selective action that could synergize with resveratrol in a manner independent
of p53. In a xenograft model of human colon cancer, a divalent TRAILmim/DR5 peptide inhibited tumor growth.
Our results offer a proof-of-principle for the development of synthetic small molecules to trigger the TRAIL
apoptosis pathway for cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1101–10. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor-α–related apoptosis–inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L/TNFSF10) is the only known endogenous molecule with the unique characteristic of inducing
apoptosis in tumor cells while sparing normal ones (1).
TRAIL is a type II trans-membrane protein that, like other
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members, binds as
a homotrimer to its receptors. Four membrane-bound TRAIL
specific receptors have been described: two death receptors
(DR4/TRAIL-R1/TNFRSF10A and DR5/TRAIL-R2/
TNFRSF10B; refs. 2, 3) that mediate the apoptogenic signal
and two decoy receptors (DcR1/TRAIL-R3/TNFRSF10C and
DcR2/RRAIL-R4/TNFRSF10D). Albeit on binding the ligand,
DcR1 and DcR2 do not transduce the apoptogenic signal,

on TRAIL binding, the ligand-receptor complexes oligomerize and transmit the apoptotic signal through DR4 or DR5
intracellular domains, which provide a scaffold for specific
adaptor proteins [such as Fas-associated death domain
(FADD)] and initiator caspases, thereby forming the death
inducing signaling complex (DISC). DISC formation enables
autocleavage of the initiator caspases resulting in activation
of the death-executing caspase cascade and ultimately cell
death (for recent reviews, see refs. 1, 4–6). Despite its regulation by p53 (7), the apoptogenic action of TRAIL or other
member of the TNF family (8) is largely independent of p53
integrity (9).
In addition to its role in tumor surveillance (10–16), TRAIL
exerts potent tumoricidal activity also in a cell-autonomous
fashion. Indeed, several antitumor signaling pathways (e.g.,
retinoids, rexinoids, and IFNs) and novel drugs (e.g., histone
deacetylase inhibitors) converge on TRAIL (17–21). Soluble
recombinant TRAIL exhibits antitumor activity on primary
tumor cells cultured in vitro and human tumor xenografts
in vivo (22–24). Moreover, agonistic humanized monoclonal
antibodies that engage DR4 or DR5 exhibit potent antitumor
activity in vivo (25–28). Tumor cells frequently display constitutive or acquired resistance to TRAIL, which, however, can
be relieved by a poorly understood phenomenon generally referred to as sensitization. Indeed, a plethora of sensitizing
agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs and cytokines, or
ionizing radiation can revert the TRAIL-resistant phenotype
(for recent reviews, see refs. 4, 6).
Currently, two main strategies are used to explore the
TRAIL pathway for cancer therapy. On the one hand, recombinant human TRAIL (Apo2L/AMG951) is tested in clinical
trials6 for combination therapies of colorectal, non–small cell
lung cancer, and non–Hodgkin's lymphoma. The second

therapeutic option is the use of activating humanized antibodies directed against the death receptor DR4 (mapatumumab/HGS-ETR1) or DR5 (lexatumumab/HGS-ETR2/
AMG655). Several clinical trials assessing the therapeutic potential of these drugs in mono- and combined therapies for a
diverse set of cancers are ongoing (29). A major issue in the
use of therapeutic proteins, such as recombinant human
TRAIL (rhTRAIL) and humanized antibodies, is the production of a stable and biologically active product. Because also
the storage/transport necessities of such molecules can be
expensive, major efforts are ongoing to find new treatment
paradigms that display tumor and receptor selectivity and
efficacies that are comparable or superior to endogenous
TRAIL.
Recently, small apoptogenic peptides that bind to specific
TRAIL receptor interfaces have been reported (30, 31). It is
well established that death receptor oligomerization is important for DISC function/efficacy, and structural studies
provide novel insight into this process (32). Indeed, it has
been shown that strategies that increase receptor oligomerization amplify TRAIL-induced apoptosis (33, 34). Therefore,
we used previously described sequences (30) to systematically study the effect of peptide dimerization and trimerization on DR5 binding and selective DR5-mediated death
induction. By using two different stepwise tumorigenesis
models (35), we revealed the tumor-selective activity of such
TRAIL mimics (TRAILmim) in vitro and determined their capacity to synergize with resveratrol. We show that neither
the DR5-selective mimic (TRAILmim/DR5) nor resveratrol affects the viability of normal cells and that resveratrol sensitization to TRAILmim/DR5 takes place in a p53-independent
manner. Finally, we show the antitumor activity of divalent
TRAILmim/DR5 peptides in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Recombinant human DR4, DR5, DcR1, and DcR2
were from Alexis Biochemicals. Resveratrol was from Sigma.
Sources of antibodies and the cell lines used in this study are
described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Peptide synthesis. Linear precursors of peptides 1m–3m
were prepared using standard Fmoc chemistry starting from
Rink amide resin (36) and with BOP (37) as a coupling
agent. The peptides were cleaved from the resin using a trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/DTT/H2O solution, purified by preparative C 18 reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and lyophilized. Disulfide bridge formation was done by air oxidation in aqueous
medium under slightly alkaline conditions (pH 8.0) at a peptide concentration of 0.8 mg/mL. Crude cyclic peptides were
purified by preparative C18 RP-HPLC and lyophilized. Divalent 1d–3d were prepared as described (30) by reaction of
cyclic peptides (2.2 equiv) with the bis-succinimidyl carboxymethoxyacetate (1 equiv) in dimethylformamide in the
presence of a tertiary base. The detailed synthesis of triva-

lent 1t–3t based on adamantane core will be reported elsewhere. Briefly, triamine adamantane (38) was reacted with
succinic anhydride. The resulting triacid was converted to
the corresponding tris-succinimidyl ester by reaction with
N-hydroxysuccinimide and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Trivalent 1t–3t molecules were obtained by reacting the
corresponding cyclic peptides 1m–3m (3.3 equiv) with the
adamantane tris-succinimidyl ester in dimethylformamide
in the presence of a tertiary base. Divalent and trivalent molecules were purified by C18 RP-HPLC and their identity was
confirmed by mass spectrometry. The fraction of active molecules was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
under conditions of mass transport limitation; for details,
see Supplementary Data.
Surface plasmon resonance. All experiments were done
with a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore) instrument. To determine
the kinetic parameters of binding of the various peptides
on DR5, peptides were injected on a CM5 sensor chip (Research Grade, Biacore AB) previously immobilized with the
TRAIL receptors (DR5, DR4, DcR1, and DcR2) and three other
receptors of the TNF superfamily (RANK, CD95, and TNFR1).
The sensorgrams were analyzed with BIAevaluation version
4.1 using the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model. To assess
the ability of the various peptides to inhibit the binding of
rhTRAIL to DR5, the DR5 protein was preincubated with different concentrations of the peptides and then injected on
the sensor chip containing His-TRAIL. The sensorgrams were
analyzed by global fitting using the Biaeval 1.4 program and
the IC50 was calculated from a logit plot (Sigmaplot).
Apoptosis measurement. Apoptosis was determined
either by detection of phosphatidylserine externalization after co-labeling with Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide or by
APO 2.7 immunostaining, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis is displayed as the percentage of cells
presenting a positive staining on rhTRAIL or synthetic peptide treatment compared with nontreated cells as control.
Each experiment was carried out independently at least three
times.
Western blot assays. BJAB cells were treated during 16 h
with 5 μmol/L of peptides or with 0.1 or 10 nmol/L of
rhTRAIL as a positive control. Samples were harvested in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, separated by SDSPAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes,
and processed as described in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
DISC experiments. Cells (108) were stimulated with either
5 or 30 μmol/L of peptides or 5 μg/mL His-TRAIL as a positive control for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed with cold
PBS and then lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer [containing 1%
NP40, 20 mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L of NaCl,
and 10% of glycerol]. Lysates were precleared with Sepharose
6B (Sigma-Aldrich) and the DISC was immunoprecipitated
using 5 μg of anti–caspase-8 antibody bound to protein GSepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were processed for immunoblotting to detect DR5,
DR4, FADD, and caspase-8.
In vivo analysis of antitumor activity of synthetic
peptides. Five-week-old athymic (nu/nu) female mice were

used for all in vivo experiments. Injections of 5 × 106 HCT116
cells were done in both flanks. Xenografts were allowed to develop for 4 to 5 d after grafting, and tumor volume was determined by caliper measurement. Animals were randomly
sorted into treatment groups presenting a mean tumor volume of 20 mm3. The initial value for each group was arbitrarily established as 100 and all subsequent changes in tumor
volume for each group were expressed as percent change in
comparison with the starting tumor mass [(tumor volume
day n) × 100 / (tumor volume at day 1)] and is referred to
as normalized tumor volume. Doses of 4 milligram per kilogram (mpk) 1d, 8 mpk 1d, and 8 mpk 2d (in 0.9% NaCl), or
vehicle (0.9% NaCl), were daily administered by i.p. injection.
Growth curves were obtained by externally measuring tumors
everyday during 10 or 14 d. Percentage of growth inhibition
was calculated as follows: 100% − [normalized tumor volume
at last day of treatment in treated group × 100% / normalized
tumor volume at last day of treatment in control group]. The
remaining animals (at least six per group) were released from
treatment and the tumors were measured everyday during 5
d. Mice body weight was determined at the beginning and at
the end of the treatment.

Results
TRAIL-mimicking peptides selectively bind to DR5.
Monovalent TRAIL mim/DR5 peptides (1m, 2m, and 3m;
Fig. 1A) were synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry
and cyclized as described in Materials and Methods. Divalent TRAILmim/DR5 peptides 1d, 2d, and 3d were prepared
by coupling with bis-succinimidyl carboxymethoxyacetate.
As adamantane derivatives are mechanically rigid and conformationally well defined, they represent a useful scaffold
for trivalent display (38). Therefore, an adamantyl core was
chosen to generate the trivalent TRAILmim/DR5 peptides 1t,
2t, and 3t (Fig. 1A).
The selectivity of the peptides for the four TRAIL receptors
was validated by SPR. For this, recombinant DR4, DR5, DcR1,
or DcR2 proteins were covalently immobilized on a sensor
chip and TRAILmim/DR5 or rhTRAIL was injected. As previously reported, rhTRAIL binds to all its receptors, whereas
the synthetic monovalent peptides exclusively recognize
DR5 (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1). Similar results were
obtained for divalent molecules (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Moreover, TRAILmim/DR5 neither binds to other death domain–containing receptors such as TNFR1 and CD95
(Supplementary Fig. S1) nor recognizes the mouse homologue of DR5 (data not shown). Taken together, these results
reveal the stringent selectivity of these synthetic molecules
for human DR5.
Multivalent TRAILmim/DR5 peptides display increased affinity to DR5. Ligands of the TNF superfamily are generally
organized as trimers, and it is postulated that trimerization
is requisite for inducing death receptor clustering and the
induction of a substantial apoptogenic response (33, 39).
Indeed, SPR experiments in which recombinant human
DR5 (rhDR5) was covalently immobilized on a sensor
chip and flushed with monovalent, divalent, or trivalent

www.aacrjournals.org

TRAILmim/DR5 peptides revealed that all monovalent peptides
bound to rhDR5 with affinity in the micromolar range. Divalent peptides substantially improved the binding affinity to
rhDR5 between 100- and 6,000-fold, with the strongest effect
observed for 2 (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover,
trivalent 3t resulted in a 45-fold increased affinity to rhDR5
relative to 3d. That this effect was less evident for 1 and 2 is
most likely due to the different lysine anchoring of the peptide to the adamantyl core, which may not be compatible
with optimal cooperative binding to the receptor. Note that
a low solubility observed for 1t may also be a contributing
factor.
Analysis of the association rate of the peptides to DR5
(kon) revealed that the kinetics of TRAILmim/DR5 peptide association was increased for divalent molecules (Table 1). This
effect was more evident for 2d (800-fold) than for 3d (50fold) or 1d (8-fold). Interestingly, trivalent peptides did not
substantially increase the association rates relative to the divalent ones.
As is apparent from the corresponding dissociation kinetics (koff), divalent 1 and 2 stabilized the peptide-receptor
complex by 1 order of magnitude, whereas trivalent molecules for each of these peptides (1t and 2t) did not further
improve complex stability (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2).
In contrast, generation of a trivalent 3t stabilized the complex by 65-fold compared with its divalent molecule. Together, the above data reveal that, for optimally designed
TRAILmim/DR5 peptides, generation of multivalent molecules
can result in a several thousand-fold increased affinity, which
originates from the effects on both the association and dissociation kinetics and is sensitive to subtle changes of the
sequence (R to K) and/or the anchoring point, as well as
the nature of the core used.
The DR5 binding surfaces of TRAIL mim/DR5 peptides
were explored by competitive SPR inhibition assays. For
this, rhTRAIL was immobilized on a sensor chip, and solutions consisting of a constant concentration of rhDR5 and
stepwise 2-fold increasing concentrations of peptides were
successively injected. All peptides competed with rhTRAIL
for binding to rhDR5 in a concentration-dependent manner, and divalent molecules of all three peptides (1, 2,
and 3) resulted in largely increased competition at equimolar concentration, as revealed by the left shift of the
dose-response curve (Fig. 1C). Whereas solubility issues
precluded conclusion about the ability of 1t to inhibit
TRAIL binding to DR5, 2t showed a similar inhibitory capacity as 2m. In the case of 3, the inhibitory capacity
gradually increased from monovalent to divalent to trivalent molecules (Fig. 1C; ki). These competition experiments
confirm that TRAIL and TRAILmim/DR5 peptides target, directly or indirectly, common surface(s) at the cognate DR5
receptor.
TRAIL mim/DR5 activates DR5-mediated apoptosis in
vitro. The efficiency and selectivity of peptides to trigger
DR5-mediated apoptosis in vitro were analyzed using the
BJAB (Burkitt lymphoma) model, which consists of cells that
express endogenous levels of DR4 and either lack (DR5-DEF)
or express (DR5-DEF+DR5) the DR5 receptor (40). BJAB cells

were incubated with equimolar quantities of the monovalent,
divalent, and trivalent TRAILmim/DR5 peptides or rhTRAIL as
positive control. Fifty-five to eighty percent of DR5-DEF+DR5
cells became apoptotic after 16-hour treatment with either
divalent or trivalent molecules (Fig. 2A) in a dose-dependent
manner (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, monovalent
peptides did not trigger any significant apoptosis under identical conditions. Treatment of DR5-DEF with 10 nmol/L
rhTRAIL induced ∼40% apoptosis after 16-hour incubation,
supporting the notion that signaling through DR4 was sufficient to trigger cell death. However, no induction of apoptosis was observed when this cell line was treated with either
divalent or trivalent molecules (Fig. 2A), revealing their
DR5 selectivity. To support this observation, the effect of

TRAILmim/DR5 or rhTRAIL on DISC formation was analyzed
by caspase-8 immunoprecipitation (41), followed by Western
blot with antibodies recognizing DR4, DR5, and FADD.
Indeed, whereas DR4 receptor and FADD adaptor protein
were co-immunoprecipitated from DR5-DEF cells incubated
with rhTRAIL, no DISC formation was detected on treatment
with any of the peptides (Fig. 2B). Moreover, DR4, DR5, and
FADD were present in immunoprecipitates derived from
DR5-DEF+DR5 cells exposed to rhTRAIL. In contrast, only
DR5 and FADD were co-immunoprecipitated when this cell
line was incubated with TRAILmim/DR5 (Fig. 2B). DISC-IP
experiments showed that high doses (30 μmol/L) of 1m
and 3m induced DISC formation. Yet, the percentage of

Tumoricidal Activity of DR5-Selective Peptides

either 15 or 30 μmol/L of these peptides was negligible compared with their multivalent homologues (Supplementary
Fig. S4), emphasizing that increasing the valency enhances
the apoptogenic potential of TRAILmim/DR5 peptides.
Western blot analysis confirmed that TRAILmim/DR5 induces cell death in a caspase-dependent manner involving
initiator (caspase-8 and caspase-9) and executor (caspase3) caspases and resulting in substrate (PARP) cleavage in
DR5-DEF+DR5, but not in DR5-DEF, cells (Fig. 2C). Albeit
2d and 3t can reach similar apoptogenic activity on prolonged treatment (Fig. 2A, 16 hours), time-course experiments revealed that whereas 3t reaches its maximal effect
after 4.5 hours, 2d only does it after 7.5 hours (Fig. 2D). This
indicates that increasing the valency dictates not only the
extent of the apoptotic response observed but also the
death kinetics. These observations confirm the specificity
of TRAILmim/DR5 to trigger a DR5-dependent apoptosis and
indicate that divalent molecules (or higher order valency)
are required to trigger substantial cell death.
Resveratrol sensitization to TRAILmim/DR5 induces extensive tumor-selective apoptosis without affecting normal
cells. To determine whether active TRAILmim/DR5 triggers apoptosis only in tumor cells, we used a stepwise tumorigenesis model in which primary normal human embryonic
kidney (HEK) cells have been transformed into tumorigenic
cells (HA1ER) by overexpressing telomerase, the SV40 early
region, and activated RASG12V (35). Normal and tumor cells
were exposed to 5 μmol/L TRAIL mim/DR5 or 10 nmol/L
rhTRAIL as a positive control. Importantly, rhTRAIL induced
a significant apoptotic response in tumor cells without affecting the viability of the parental normal counterpart
(Fig. 3A). However, compared with DR5-DEF+DR5, HA1ER
cells displayed only a weak apoptotic response toward 1d
under identical conditions.
Because low sensitivity of solid cancers to TRAILmim/DR5
would represent an important limitation, we explored if sensitization, which is well described for rhTRAIL (1), would also
enhance TRAILmim/DR5 activity. Among the various sensitizing agents, resveratrol has been described as having only negligible effect on normal tissues (42, 43). Notably, resveratrol
dramatically enhanced the sensitivity of HA1ER to 1d by

10-fold, and apoptosis induced by rhTRAIL was increased 6fold (Fig. 3B). To assess the tumor selectivity of this sensitization to TRAILmim/DR5, we used the above-described stepwise
model and the corresponding model derived from human
foreskin fibroblasts composed of normal BJ and fully transformed BJELR cells (35). Whereas normal HEK and BJ cells
were entirely resistant to the combination of resveratrol
(100 μmol/L) and either 1d (5 μmol/L) or rhTRAIL (0.1
nmol/L), more than 30% of HA1ER and BJELR cells were killed
by TRAILmim/DR5 at doses at which none of the compounds
efficiently triggered apoptosis as a single agent (Fig. 3C).
Similar results were obtained for rhTRAIL. These results
show that resveratrol dramatically sensitizes tumor cells to
TRAILmim/DR5 without affecting tumor selectivity.
Resveratrol sensitization to TRAILmim/DR5 is largely independent of p53. The p53 protein, which mediates critical
cell functions including the response to genotoxic stress, is
one of the most commonly altered proteins in human cancer,
and its loss usually results in resistance to cell death stimuli.
Therefore, abnormal p53 function could block the effects of
sensitizers acting in a p53-dependent manner. However,
HCT116 wild-type and p53 −/− colon carcinoma cells responded similarly (Fig. 3D), indicating that resveratrol sensitization to TRAILmim/DR5 is largely independent of the p53
status of the cell.
Antitumor activity of divalent TRAILmim/DR5 in vivo. To
assess if the apoptogenic activity of divalent TRAILmim/DR5
on cultured HCT116 cells is indicative of an antitumoral activity in vivo, 1d and 2d were tested in the HCT116 tumor
xenograft model. For that, nude mice were s.c. injected with
5 × 106 HCT116 cells and a daily i.p. administration of 1d or
2d was started 4 days after tumor grafting (mean tumor volume ∼20 mm3). Doses of 4 mpk and 8 mpk of 1d were administered during 10 days. Interestingly, under these
conditions, we observed major dose-dependent antitumor
activities with mean growth inhibitions of 30% and 63%, respectively (Fig. 4A). Similar in vivo efficiencies were observed
for both 1d and 2d after 14 days of daily 8-mpk i.p. injections
(growth inhibitions of 62% and 51%, respectively; Fig. 4B).
That tumor growth increased dramatically when the treatment
was discontinued confirms that tumor growth inhibition was

Tumoricidal Activity of DR5-Selective Peptides

Figure 3. Resveratrol sensitizes tumor cells to TRAILmim/DR5 in a p53-independent manner. A, HEK and HA1ER cells were treated with either 1d (5 μmol/L) or
rhTRAIL (10 nmol/L) and apoptosis was determined as the percentage of APO 2.7–positive cells by FACS analysis. BJAB DR5-DEF+DR5 and HCT116
cells were included in the experimental setup as positive control. B, HA1ER cells were treated with either 1d (5 μmol/L) or rhTRAIL (0.1 nmol/L) in the
presence or absence of resveratrol (50 or 100 μmol/L). Apoptosis was determined as the percentage of APO 2.7–positive cells by FACS. C, normal HEK and
BJ cells as well as tumorigenic HA1ER and BJELR cells were treated with either 1d (5 μmol/L) or TRAIL (0.1 nmol/L) in combination with resveratrol
(100 μmol/L) or as a single agent. Apoptosis was determined as the percentage of cells displaying positive labeling for APO 2.7 as determined by FACS
analysis. D, HCT116 colon cancer cells, wild-type (wt) or p53 knockout (p53−/−), were treated with either 1d peptide (1 μmol/L) or TRAIL (0.1 nmol/L) in
combination with resveratrol (100 μmol/L) or as a single agent. Apoptosis was determined as the percentage of cells displaying positive labeling for APO 2.7

directly linked to the activities of 1d or 2d (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S5). Note that the treatments did not cause any
changes in body weight or animal behavior in any of the groups
(data not shown). However, as the human TRAILmim/DR5
mimics do not bind the mouse TRAIL-R2, no extrapolation
to potential toxicity in humans can be made.

Discussion
The majority of current anticancer therapies, in particular chemotherapy and radiotherapy, follow treatment paradigms that attack the general features of cell growth.
Consequently, not only the viability of tumor cells is affected but also that of normal ones, thus causing considerable
side effects. To overcome this limitation, novel principles
that have promise for developing cancer cell–targeted
therapies are being intensively explored (44). One such

principle is based on the astounding capacity of the TRAIL
signaling pathway to kill tumor but not normal cells
(4, 29, 45, 46).
Although recombinant proteins and humanized antibodies
without doubt have a major role as therapeutics, they display
the inherent disadvantages of proteins associated with production (purity and costs) and functional stability on storage.
These aspects provide a strong rationale for the development
of more “drug-like” activators of the TRAIL signaling pathway. In addition to the therapeutic aspect, there is a need
for tools with which the complexity of the TRAIL signaling
pathway, which engages four to five distinct receptors, can
be deconvoluted.
For all the above reasons, we set out to characterize and
explore the possible therapeutic potential of recently recognized novel synthetic mediators of the TRAIL pathway, the
TRAIL-mimicking (TRAILmim) peptides. Given their synthetic

nature, biological contamination and protein stability related
with protein production do not have to be considered as potential problems. Moreover, high yield production at a low
cost is an additional advantage of these approaches. In the
present work, we show that such synthetic peptides recapitulate the action of TRAIL through DR5 by providing evidence
that multivalent peptides efficiently trigger the TRAIL apoptotic pathway. It is interesting to note that depending on
the peptide, both divalent and trivalent TRAILmim/DR5 can induce DISC formation and apoptosis, supporting previously
discussed models for receptor clustering (47).
Moreover, we show that these synthetic peptides retain
their tumor-selective apoptogenic activity even when combined with sensitizing compounds and exert a substantial
anticancer activity in vivo as single agents. Although no
“off-target” toxicity was observed in human primary normal
fibroblasts and epithelial cells tested, detailed pharmacology
and toxicology analyses are required to assess the potential
use of TRAIL mimics in human cancer therapy. We observed that increasing TRAILmim/DR5 valency enhances the
affinity to DR5 receptor as well as the apoptogenic capacity
of these molecules, and determined that the level of multivalency required to achieve a substantial death induction is
dictated by the initial peptide sequence and the anchoring
point. It is likely that the chemical nature of the scaffold
used for polyvalent display may affect the biological prop-

1108

Cancer Res; 70(3) February 1, 2010

erties (48) and that optimal projection of DR5 binding peptides using more tailored scaffolds may lead to even more
potent TRAIL mimics.
Importantly, we have noticed that peptides showing the
highest affinity for DR5 and superior association rate/
complex stability by SPR were those presenting the strongest
apoptogenic activity in vitro. This indicates that the kinetic
parameters of peptide-receptor interaction could be taken
as indicative for the potential apoptogenic capacity of the analyzed molecules. Our experiments show that the peptides
efficiently trigger the TRAIL pathway, which is largely independent of the p53 status of the cell. Notably, the extent of
cell death obtained by peptide treatment was enhanced by
combined treatment with resveratrol in a p53-independent
manner without affecting the viability of normal cells. It is
worth pointing out that the doses of rhTRAIL used in various
xenograft assays to achieve tumor growth inhibition (15–60
mpk; ref. 1) are similar to the doses (4–8 mpk) used in the
present study when correcting for the different molecular
weights; note in this context that preliminary data reveal that
the ex vivo half life of 1d and 2d in serum is ∼4 hours (supplementary information). In view of the observations that
other chemo-/radiotherapeutic treatments can enhance
TRAIL action, TRAIL mimics like TRAILmim/DR5 and other receptor agonists (29) could pave the way toward a novel type
of apoptogenic therapy.
