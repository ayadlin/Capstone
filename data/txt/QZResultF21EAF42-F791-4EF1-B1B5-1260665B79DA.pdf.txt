Conditions Promotes Colorectal Cancer Progression

Abstract
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the most abundant COX-2–derived prostaglandin found in colorectal cancer,
promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival via multiple signaling pathways. However, the role of PGE2 in
tumor hypoxia is not well understood. Here, we show a synergistic effect of PGE2 and hypoxia on enhancing
angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) expression and that elevation of ANGPTL4 promotes colorectal cancer
growth. PGE2 induces ANGPTL4 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels under hypoxic conditions.
Moreover, hypoxia induces one of the PGE2 receptors, namely EP1. Activation of EP1 enhances ANGPTL4
expression, whereas blockage of EP1 by an antagonist inhibits PGE2 induction of ANGPTL4 under hypoxic
conditions. Importantly, overexpression of ANGPTL4 promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, treatment with ANGPTL4 recombinant protein increases colorectal carcinoma cell proliferation
through effects on STAT1 signaling. The MAP kinase and Src pathways mediate ANGPTL4-induced STAT1
expression and activation. These results are relevant to human disease because we found that the expression of
ANGPTL4 and STAT1 are elevated in 50% of human colorectal cancers tested and there is a positive correlation
between COX-2 and ANGPTL4 as well STAT1 expression in colorectal carcinomas. Collectively, these ﬁndings
suggest that PGE2 plays an important role in promoting cancer cell proliferation via ANGPTL4 under hypoxic
conditions. Cancer Res; 71(22); 7010–20. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Recent evidence conﬁrms a reduction in risk for colorectal
and other cancers in individuals who regularly take aspirin or
other nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs. These drugs are
potent inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. Elevation of COX-2 was
found in approximately 50% of colorectal adenomas and 85% of
adenocarcinomas (1, 2) and is associated with worse survival
among patients with colorectal cancer (3). COX-2 converts free
arachidonic acid into prostanoids, including prostaglandins
(PG) and thromboxanes (TX). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the
most abundant prostaglandin found in colorectal cancer (4). An
increasingly large body of evidence has shown that PGE2
mediates the tumor-promoting effects of COX-2 in colorectal
cancer (5). PGE2 treatment dramatically increased both smalland large-intestinal adenoma burden in ApcMin/þ mice and
signiﬁcantly enhanced azoxymethane–induced colon tumor
incidence and multiplicity (6, 7). PGE2 promotes tumor growth

by stimulating EP receptor signaling with subsequent enhancement of cellular proliferation, promotion of angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis, and stimulation of invasion/motility (8).
Hypoxia is one of the most common and critical factors
identiﬁed thus far in the regulation of cancer progression and
metastasis (9, 10). Adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia is
achieved largely by undergoing genetic changes that enable
them to survive and become more malignant or invasive (11).
Hypoxia induces COX-2 expression and PGE2 levels via hypoxic-inducible factor (HIF)-1, a major transcription factor that
regulates the hypoxic response, in colorectal carcinoma cells
(12, 13). Increased levels of PGE2 during hypoxia, in turn,
potentiates HIF-1 transcriptional activity and promotes colorectal carcinoma cell growth and survival (12), suggesting that
cross-talk exists between PGE2 and hypoxia. However, the
mechanism through which PGE2 promotes colorectal cancer
progression in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment is
unclear. We postulated that PGE2 might mediate a pivotal
tumor cellular adaptive response to hypoxia with the implication for connecting tumor hypoxia to cancer progression.
Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secretary
protein that is cleaved into an N-terminal coiled-coil fragment
(N-ANGPTL4) and a C-terminal ﬁbrinogen-like domain
(C-ANGPTL4) that modulates the disposition of circulating
triglycerides (14). Although the role of ANGPTL4 in lipid
metabolism has been well characterized, its role in cancer
progression is poorly understood. Although recent studies
suggest that ANGPTL4 is involved in cancer progression, the
precise role of ANGPTL4 in angiogenesis and cancer progression is still debated. For example, ANGPTL4 has been reported

PGE2 and Hypoxia Synergistically Induce ANGPTL4 Expression

to have proangiogenic effects and antiangiogenic effects in
different models (15–17). Moreover, ANGPTL4 mediates TGFb–induced lung metastasis of breast cancer (18) but inhibits
metastasis of melanoma cells (19). These conﬂicting data
support the need of additional research to address the role
of ANGPTL4 in cancer progression.
In this study, ANGPTL4 is identiﬁed as a novel focal point
of the cross-talk between PGE2 and hypoxia signaling pathways in colorectal cancer cells. Our results show that PGE2
and hypoxia synergistically induce ANGPTL4 expression via
EP1. Importantly, we show that the elevation of ANGPTL4
promotes tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we
identiﬁed STAT1 as a new target of ANGPTL4 and found that
inhibition of STAT1 attenuated ANGPTL4 induction of
colorectal cancer cell proliferation. We further elucidated
the ANGPTL4 signaling pathways in response to STAT1
expression and activation. The maximal induction of
ANGPTL4 required both hypoxia and PGE2, indicating the
complex nature of interactions within the tumor microenvironment that affect cancer signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
PGE2, 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2, and SC-19220 were purchased
from Cayman Chemical Company. U73122, BAPTA-AM,
PD98059, SU6656, and diphenylene iodonium (DP1) were
purchased from EMD Chemicals. ONO-AE3-208 was kindly
provided by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Full-length and C-terminal ANGPTL4 recombinant proteins were obtained from R&D
Systems.
Cell culture and treatment
LS-174T, HT-29, and HCT-116 were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. All cells were routinely
maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% FBS, 100
units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in a 5% CO2
humidiﬁed incubator at 37 C. Cells were exposed to hypoxia by
placing them in a mixed-gas incubator that was infused with an
atmosphere consisting of 94% N2, 5% CO2, and 1% O2. Cells
were treated with PGE2 at the same time.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol (Invitrogen).
cDNA was synthesized from 2 mg of total RNA with HighCapacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems) and mixed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assay Mix,
sterile water, and TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
was carried out using a 7900 HT Fast (Applied Biosystems)
system, and expression of target genes mRNA relative to 18s
rRNA was calculated.
Measurement of ANGPTL4 secretion
Cells were exposed to PGE2 or hypoxic conditions, conditioned medium was collected, and then the amount of
ANGPTL4 secreted into medium was measured using Human
ANGPTL4 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc.).

DNA construction
ANGPTL4 cDNA (Origene) was ampliﬁed with pfuUltra
Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR products
were digested with XhoI and NotI and were cloned into
pBMN-I-GFP (addgen).
Establishment of stable cell line
pBMN-I-GFP and pBMN-I-GFP-ANGPTL4 retroviral vectors
were transfected into Phoenix cells in 60-mm dishes using
Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Culture medium containing virus particles
was collected 48 hours later and was added to LS-174T cells.
Cells infected were sorted by green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
positivity to eliminate uninfected cells.
Western blotting
Whole cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analyses
using lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150
mmol/L NaCl, 1% TX-100, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0, and
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride. Samples were denatured in a SDS sample buffer. Total proteins were separated by
loading 20 mg of total cell lysate on a denaturing 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes
were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with primary antibodies that
recognize STAT1, Src, phospho-Src (Cell Signaling Technology), ANGPTL4 (R&D Systems), ERk, phospho-ERk (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and Actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories Inc.) was used at 1:2,000 to detect primary antibodies, and
enzymatic signals were visualized by chemiluminescence.
Cell viability assay
Ninety-six–well plates were seeded with 5,000 cells per well
and cells were treated without or with ANGPTL4 in serum-free
medium for 3 days. Cell viability was determined using Cell
Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science).
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were treated with ANGPTL4, washed with PBS, and
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature, and subsequent blocking with PBS containing 1%
bovine serum albumin and 0.1% TX-100 for 30 minutes at room
temperature. The cells were incubated with STAT1 antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology) for 2 hours at room temperature,
followed by biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc.) for 1 hour, then Fluorescein streptavidin (Vector
Laboratories Inc.) for 30 minutes, and then 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) for 5 minutes to visualize
nuclei. Cells were examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope
(Nikon ECLIPSE TE300) to determine localization of STAT1.
Immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded specimens were treated with xylene and
ethanol to remove the parafﬁn. The slides were immersed in
Borg decloaker solution (Biocare Medical, Inc.) and boiled in a
pressure cooker at 125 C for 5 minutes for antigen retrieval.

were blocked with 5% normal goat serum and incubated with
anti-STAT1 (Cell Signaling), HIF-1a (BD Biosciences), and
ANGPTL4 (Adipobioscience) at 4 C overnight. After washing
with PBS, the slides were incubated with Goat anti-Rabbit HRP

with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine reagent (Vector Laboratories) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin.
RNA interference
siGENOME SMARTpool siRNAs targeting STAT1 (M003543-01-000) were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. LS174T
cells were transfected with 20 nmol/L of STAT1 siRNA or
nontargeting siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's speciﬁcations. The efﬁcacy of knockdown was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis.
Xenograft study
All mice were housed and treated in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
LS-174T cells (5  105) selected for the stable expression of
ANGPTL4 (ANGPTL4/LS-174T) or control GFP (GFP/LS-174T)

Results
PGE2 enhances ANGPTL4 expression in colorectal
carcinoma cells under hypoxic conditions
To help mimic the conditions present in the tumor microenvironment, we examined the role of PGE2 under normoxic
and hypoxic conditions. We conducted transcriptome analysis
with RNA isolated from LS-174T cells exposed to PGE2 and/or
hypoxia. LS-174T cells normally have low COX-2 levels and do
not produce PGE2 under normoxic and hypoxic conditions
(data not shown). Analysis of our microarray data revealed that

7012

ANGPTL4 was one of the PGE2 downstream targets in cells
exposed to hypoxia. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that
hypoxia induces ANGPTL4 expression in several cell lines
including monocytes and adipocytes (20–22). As expected,
hypoxia increased ANGPTL4 expression at both mRNA and
protein levels in LS-174T cells (Fig. 1A and B). Strikingly, PGE2
treatment dramatically enhanced ANGPTL4 expression under
hypoxic conditions at both mRNA and protein levels in a dosedependent manner in LS-174T cells, whereas PGE2 had no
effect on ANGPTL4 expression under normoxic conditions
(Fig. 1A and B). The synergistic effect of PGE2 and hypoxia
on ANGPTL4 protein expression was also observed in HCT-116
and HT-29 colorectal carcinoma cells (Fig. 1C). These results
show that PGE2 and hypoxia synergistically induce ANGPTL4
expression in colorectal cancer cells.
EP1 mediates PGE2-stimulated ANGPTL4 expression
during hypoxia
To explore why PGE2 induces ANGPTL4 expression only
under hypoxic conditions but not under normoxic conditions,
we ﬁrst examined the effects of hypoxia on PGE2 receptor
levels. There are 4 known PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and
EP4) that are typical G protein-coupled receptors. Because
recent reports showed that hypoxia induced EP1 expression in
osteoblastic cells (23), we examined the effect of hypoxia on EP1
expression in colorectal cancer cells. Indeed, hypoxia speciﬁcally increased only EP1 expression and not other PGE2 receptors in LS-174T cells (Fig. 2A). Because LS-174T cells express
high levels of EP4, we examined which receptor mediates the
effects of PGE2 on upregulation of ANGPTL4 expression. Treatment of LS-174T cells with an EP1 antagonist, SC19220, blocked
PGE2-induced ANGPTL4 induction under hypoxic conditions,
whereas an EP4 antagonist, ONO-AE3-208, had no effect on
ANGPTL4 expression (Fig 2B). Consistent with these results, a
selective EP1 agonist (17-PT PGE2) has the same effects as PGE2
on ANGPTL4 expression (Fig. 2C). Because EP1 is coupled to
the Gq/PLC/Ca2þ pathway (24), we tested whether inhibition
of this pathway attenuates PGE2 induction of ANGPTL4.
Treatment of LS-174T cells with a PLC inhibitor (U73122) and
a Ca2þ chelating agent (BAPTA) partially suppressed PGE2induced ANGPTL4 expression under hypoxic conditions,
respectively (Fig. 2D). These results reveal that EP1 is induced
by hypoxia and mediates PGE2 induction of ANGPTL4.
ANGPTL4 promotes tumor growth in vitro and in vivo
To determine the biologic role of ANGPTL4 in regulating
cancer cell proliferation, LS-174T cells were treated with fulllength recombinant ANGPTL4 (F-ANGPTL4) and C-ANGPTL4,
respectively. Our results showed that C-ANGPTL4 more
dramatically promoted LS-174T cell proliferation than
F-ANGPTL4 (Fig. 3A, top). In addition, C-ANGPTL4 exhibited
similar effects on regulating HCT-116 and HT-29 cell proliferation (Fig. 3A, bottom). In contrast, both F-ANGPTL4 and
C-ANGPTL4 had no effects on regulating LS-174T cell apoptosis (data not shown). To conﬁrm the proliferative effect of
ANGPTL4, we established LS-174T cells that overexpressed
ANGPTL4 (ANGPTL4/LS-174T) and control cells (GFP/LS174T). C-ANGPTL4 (37 kDa) was easily detected in the

conditioned medium of ANGPTL4/LS-174T cells (Fig. 3B, top).
Because ANGPTL4 is proteolytically cleaved upon secretion
from cells, F-ANGPTL4 was strongly detected in the cell lysate
but not the conditioned medium (data not shown). Consistent
with above results, overexpression of ANGPTL4 enhanced cell
proliferation (Fig. 3B, bottom). These results are consistent
with our observation that PGE2 increases cell proliferation
under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3C).
To validate our in vitro results in vivo, we injected ANGPTL4/
LS-174T or GFP/LS-174T cells into the ﬂanks of nude mice. The
tumor size was measured starting from 13 to 28 days after
injection. Tumor weight and C-ANGPTL4 levels were also measured after mice were euthanized. As expected, C-ANGPTL4
levels were higher in the tumor tissue of mice injected with cells
expressing ANGPTL4 than in the controls (Fig. 3D, left). Moreover, cells expressing ANGPTL4 formed larger tumors than the
control cells (Fig. 3D, middle and right), suggesting that elevation
of ANGPTL4 promotes colorectal cancer growth. Taken together, these results suggest that ANGPTL4 accelerates colorectal
cancer growth by enhancing cell proliferation.
STAT1 is important for ANGPTL4-mediated cell
proliferation
Although several recent reports have shown the role of
ANGPTL4 in cancer progression (15, 25, 26), little is known
about how ANGPTL4 regulates cell proliferation and what
downstream targets of ANGPTL4 are involved in regulating
cell proliferation. The microarray analysis revealed that
C-ANGPTL4 treatment increased IFN-related gene expression,

www.aacrjournals.org

such as STAT1, IFI35, IFI9, and IRF1. These genes were validated
by qRT-PCR (data not shown). We further showed that
C-ANGPTL4 treatment induced STAT1 expression at both the
mRNA and protein levels as well as its nuclear localization
(Fig. 4A, top and middle). Immunohistochemical staining further revealed that STAT1 expression was elevated in tumor
tissue derived from mice implanted with ANGPTL4/LS-174 cells
as compared with the GFP control (Fig. 4A, bottom). Because
STAT1 is overexpressed in head and neck and lung cancer and
has been reported to have a proliferative effect (27, 28), we
examined the contribution of STAT1 to C-ANGPTL4-induced
cell proliferation. Knockdown of STAT1 signiﬁcantly suppressed
C-ANGPTL4-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). Because extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and Src are known to be
the critical signaling molecules for cell proliferation or survival
(29), we determined whether these pathways are involved in
C-ANGPTL4 induction of STAT1 expression. As shown in
Fig. 4C, PGE2 was able to enhance the phosphorylation of Src
and ERK as well as STAT1 expression under hypoxic conditions.
Moreover, C-ANGPTL4 treatment induced phosphorylation of
Src and ERK in time-dependent manners (Fig. 4D, top), whereas
pharmacologic inhibitors of Src (SU6656) and ERK (PD98059)
blocked STAT1 expression stimulated by C-ANGPTL4, respectively (Fig. 4D, middle). Recently, ANGPTL4 has been reported
to stimulate NADPH-oxidase–dependent production of O2,
which in turn triggers the Src and ERK pathway (30). Therefore,
we examined whether ANGPTL4 regulated Src and ERK activation and STAT1 expression via upregulating O2 production.
Indeed, inhibition of O2 production by an NADPH oxidase

inhibitor (DP1) suppressed ANGPTL4 stimulated the phosphorylation of Src and ERK and the expression of STAT1
(Fig. 4D, bottom). Collectively, these results indicate that
STAT1 is a downstream target of C-ANGPTL4 for regulating
cancer cell proliferation and that STAT1 induction is dependent on NADPH-oxidase-mediated production of O2, Src,
and MAP kinase pathways.
ANGPTL4 and STAT1 are elevated in human colorectal
cancer specimens
Because increased levels of COX-2 and a downstream
product, PGE2, have been reported in most human colorectal
cancers (1) and hypoxia is one of the key elements in the
tumor microenvironment that promotes cancer development and progression (9, 10), we examined ANGPTL4 levels
in human colorectal cancer and the correlation of ANGPTL4
with COX-2 and STAT1 in human colorectal cancer.
ANGPTL4 mRNA levels were elevated in 16 of 30 cancer

specimens as compared with those in adjacent normal
mucosa (Fig. 5A). Moreover, ANGPTL4 expression in human
colorectal cancer specimens correlates with COX-2 expression (r ¼ 0.2433, P ¼ 0.0056). In addition, high STAT1 expression was found in 17 of 30 tumor tissues and is also correlated
with ANGPTL4 expression (r ¼ 0.6861, P  0.0001). To
support these ﬁndings, we used a public microarray database
to retrieve gene expression data of colorectal cancer patients.
Patients in the Mofﬁtt cohort (N ¼ 177) were dichotomized
according to expression level of ANGPTL4. The overall survival rate of patients with higher expression of ANGPTL4 was
signiﬁcantly worse than that of those with lower expression
of ANGPTL4 (Fig. 5B). In addition, the expression of COX-2
positively correlated with the expression of ANGPTL4 (r ¼
0.434, P  0.0001) and STAT1 (r ¼ 0.232, P ¼ 0.001) in the
Mofﬁtt cohort (Fig. 5C). Therefore, these results suggest that
elevation of ANGPTL4 could be relevant to human colorectal
cancer progression.

Discussion
Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment contributes to
cancer progression and metastasis by activating adaptive programs that promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and motility as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis. It has been
reported that there is a cross-talk between the COX-2 pathway
and signaling pathways affected by hypoxia. For example,
hypoxia induces COX-2 expression in colorectal cancer cells
and vascular endothelial cells (12, 31). Reciprocally, COX-2–
derived PGE2 regulates HIF-1 expression and transcriptional
activity in those cells (12, 32). Although a connection between
COX-2 and hypoxia has been established, the precise mechanisms by which PGE2 and hypoxia synergistically promote cancer
progression are largely unclear. In this study, we identify
ANGPTL4 as a novel PGE2 downstream target under hypoxic
conditions in colorectal cancer cells. We also found that hypoxia–induced EP1 mediates the effects of PGE2 on regulation of
ANGPTL4. Elevation of ANGPTL4 promotes tumor growth
in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that ANGPTL4 can act as a
downstream effector of PGE2 for adaptation of cancer cells to
hypoxia. Our results suggest that the COX-2-PGE2 pathway plays

www.aacrjournals.org

an important role in adapting cancer cells to the tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia that promotes cancer progression.
PGE2 exerts its biologic effects in an autocrine or paracrine
manner by binding to its cognate cell surface receptors, EP1,
EP2, EP3, and EP4. All 4 EP receptors have been implicated in
regulating cancer progression in certain contexts. These receptors are categorized into 3 groups. EP1 couples to Gq to
increase intracellular calcium, EP2 and EP4 couple to Gas
to induce intracellular cyclic AMP, and EP3 couples to Gai to
decrease cyclic AMP. EP receptors have distinct functions
because each receptor has a speciﬁc tissue distribution and
induces a speciﬁc signaling pathways (some redundancy may
exist; ref. 33). Here, we found that hypoxia speciﬁcally enhanced EP1 expression in colorectal carcinoma cells without signiﬁcant effects on EP2, EP3, or EP4 (Fig. 2A). EP1 has been
reported to promote cell survival and proliferation in different
types of cancer cells (34, 35). A role for EP1 in colorectal
tumorigenesis has been further conﬁrmed in animal models.
For example, inhibition of EP1 signaling by genetic deletion or
treatment of an EP1-selective antagonist reduced intestinal
tumor burden in ApcMin/þ and carcinogen-treated EP1/ mice
(36), showing that EP1 contributes to cancer development. Our

is expressed in hypoxic regions of the tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S1) although HIF-1a, an indicator of hypoxia, and
ANGPTL4 did not exactly colocalize in same cells but overlapped in the same area because HIF-1a is a transcription
factor and ANGPTL4 is a ligand to be secreted and diffused in
the tumors. Collectively, these ﬁndings imply that tumor
hypoxia enhances PGE2 signaling through upregulating EP1
receptor expression, which may allow for adaptation of cancer
cells to the tumor microenvironment.
The synergistic effects of hypoxia and other factors such as
insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, and TNF-a targeting
genes has been reported in multiple types of cells, including
cancer cells (37, 38). In contrast to PGE2, these factors also
induce the expression of target genes under normoxic conditions. Our results show that PGE2 induced ANGPTL4 expression only under hypoxic conditions. Several studies have

www.aacrjournals.org

revealed that ANGPTL4 is transcriptionally regulated in
response to intracellular or extracellular signals (18, 39).
Because HIF mediates hypoxia upregulation of ANGPTL4 in
different types of cells and PGE2 enhances HIF-1 transcriptional activity (12, 13, 20–22), it is possible that HIF-1 mediates
the effect of PGE2 on induction of ANGPTL4. However, our
results show that inhibition of HIF-1 did not affect PGE2
induction of ANGPTL4 (data not shown). On the basis of the
observations that ANGPTL4 is one of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) target genes (40) with
several putative peroxisome proliferator response consensus
sequences on its promoter (41) and PGE2 transactivates PPARd
activity (7), we postulate that PPARd is a potential transcription factor that could regulate PGE2-mediated ANGPTL4
expression under hypoxic conditions. Further investigation is
needed to test this hypothesis.

The functions of ANGPTL4 have been well established in
regulating lipid metabolism through the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL). N-ANGPTL4, which assembles into multimeric structures, is essential to inhibit the activity of LPL (39).
However, C-ANGPTL4 exists as a monomer and its functional
role in monomeric form is still unclear. In addition to the role of
ANGPTL4 in lipid metabolism, several recent studies have
linked F-ANGPTL4 to angiogenesis and cancer development
(15, 25, 26). However, few studies have delineated the biologic
function of C- or N-ANGPTL4 in cancer progression. Here, we
show that C-ANGPTL4 induces colorectal cancer cell proliferation more effectively than F-ANGPTL4 (Fig. 3A). In addition,
our results show for the ﬁrst time that C-ANGPTL4 induced
colorectal cancer proliferation through upregulation of STAT1.
STAT1 has been reported to stimulate cell growth and is
overexpressed in head and neck and lung cancer (27, 28). In
addition, activation of STAT1 promotes cell survival in Wilms
tumor (27). Moreover, radiation induces STAT1 expression
through activation of epidermal growth factor receptor in
breast cancer cells (42). STAT1 has been reported to regulate
the oncogenic genes Fos and Egr1 in the absence of STAT3 (43).
However, little information regarding the mechanism by which
STAT1 regulates cell proliferation and oncogenesis is available.
Because our microarray date showed that C-ANGPTL4
increased several oncogenic genes, including Fos and Egr1
(data not shown), the effect of C-ANGPTL4 on these oncogenic
genes via STAT1 may contribute to cancer cell proliferation.
Moreover, we identiﬁed novel C-ANGPTL4 downstream targets, Src and ERK, which are critical for C-ANGPTL4 induction
of STAT1 expression (Fig. 4). It has been well established
previously that the Src and ERK are responsible for cell
proliferation. Therefore, the role of ANGPTL4 in cancer development is likely conferred by C-ANGPTL4 through activating
the signaling pathways which regulate cell proliferation.
Although C- and F-ANGPTL4 have a ﬁbrinogen-like domain
of angiopoietin that binds to angiopoietin receptor Tie1 and
Tie2, C- and F-ANGPTL4 do not have any signiﬁcant afﬁnity for
those receptors (44). A recent report shows that C-ANGPTL4
interacts with integrin b1 and b5 and produces O2 to regulate
anoikis resistance of cancer cells (30). Therefore, conﬁrmation
of the C-ANGPTL4 receptor such as integrins will add to our
understanding of how C-ANGPTL4 regulates cell proliferation
as well as angiogenesis and metastasis.
It is generally accepted that hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment promotes chemoresistance (45). It has been
reported that COX-2 overexpressing cancer cells are more
resistant to doxorubicin and geﬁtinib (46, 47). Moreover,
STAT1 has been shown to play a role in chemo- and radioresistance. A recent study has shown that the IFN-related

gene signature including STAT1 and its target genes is
associated with resistance to DNA damage across multiple
cancer cell lines and can affect resistance to chemotherapy
(48). In addition, radioresistant tumor cells expressed higher
STAT1 levels than control cells (28). In accordance with
these published results, we found for the ﬁrst time that
STAT1 was upregulated by ANGPTL4, and our preliminary
data showed that ANGPTL4 treatment suppressed oxaliplatin-induced cell death in LS-147T cells (data not shown).
Furthermore, the expression of COX-2, ANGPTL4, and
STAT1 in human colorectal cancer specimens seems to be
correlated (Fig. 5). On the basis of these observations, it is
conceivable that ANGPTL4 may contribute to the hypoxia or
COX-2–induced drug resistance and may offer a therapeutic
option for colorectal cancer patients.
In conclusion, our studies reveal the molecular mechanism
by which PGE2 signaling and hypoxia coordinately promote
tumor growth. We found that PGE2 enhanced ANGPTL4
expression via EP1 receptor signaling that was enhanced by
hypoxia. Moreover, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence
showing that elevation of ANGPTL4 promotes tumor growth.
These results indicate that PGE2 plays an important role in
promoting a cellular adaptive response to hypoxia for their
growth via ANGPTL4. Knowledge about the role of PGE2 in
tumor hypoxia may enhance our understanding of how cancer
cells adapt to hypoxia for their growth. It has not escaped our
attention that other genes are also more dramatically induced
under hypoxic conditions following PGE2 treatment. This
group of genes may reveal other important connections
between inﬂammatory mediators and cancer progression in
the tumor microenvironment.
