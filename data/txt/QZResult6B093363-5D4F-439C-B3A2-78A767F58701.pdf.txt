Abstract
Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb
repressive complex 2, inhibits gene expression through methylation on lysine 27
of histone H3. EZH2 regulates normal hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and
differentiation. EZH2 also controls normal B cell differentiation. EZH2 deregulation has
been described in many cancer types including hematological malignancies. Specific
small molecules have been recently developed to exploit the oncogenic addiction
of tumor cells to EZH2. Their therapeutic potential is currently under evaluation.
This review summarizes the roles of EZH2 in normal and pathologic hematological
processes and recent advances in the development of EZH2 inhibitors for the
personalized treatment of patients with hematological malignancies.

Physiological functions of EZH2
EZH2 and Polycomb
transcription repression

state through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3
(H3K27me3) [6]. The other PRC2 members are EED,
SUZ12, RBAP46/48 and AEBP2. Although their function
has not been fully characterized, it is clear that EZH2
requires at least EED and SUZ12 to be catalytically active
in vitro, while RBAP46/48 and AEBP2 stimulate EZH2
activity [6].
It has been suggested that EZH2-mediated
H3K27me3 allows Polycomb Repressive Complex 1
(PRC1) recruitment to chromatin that will then monoubiquitinylate lysine 119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub1),
thus establishing a higher repressive state of chromatin
(Figure 1) [7, 8]. Alternatively, following H2AK119ub1
by alternative PRC1-like complexes, PRC2 components
could be recruited. They, in turn, will drive the formation
of canonical PRC1, suggesting an intimate interplay
between PRC1 and PRC2 for target gene silencing [9, 10].

complex-mediated

Epigenetic modifications play important biological
roles because they regulate gene expression by modifying
chromatin organization and by modulating transcription
initiation, elongation, splicing and termination. Epigenetic
modifications are dynamically established by DNA
methyltransferases (DNMTs) and by many categories of
histone-modifying enzymes that write, read and erase
histone modifications [1] in a highly regulated manner.
Given the importance of epigenetic information in the
control of DNA functions, epigenetic deregulations play
a key role in the development of many diseases, including
cancer where they have been extensively studied [2-5].
EZH2, one of the most studied histone-modifying
enzymes, is the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressive
Complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 is one of the two major
classes of Polycomb complexes and is responsible for
maintaining its target genes in a transcriptionally repressed

Roles of EZH2 in normal hematopoiesis

hematopoiesis by promoting pluripotency maintenance
and self-renewal of adult stem cells [8, 11]. EZH2

not only dependent on CDKN2A repression, suggesting
that other PRC2 target genes must be involved in this
function [24]. Indeed, EZH2 also regulates cell cycle
genes to promote cell cycling and controls the expression
of genes that inhibit HSC differentiation (ID2 and SOX7)
[24, 25]. Moreover, EZH2, by repressing pro-apoptotic
genes, such as NOXA, p21 and WIG1, protects HSCs from
cell death [24].
During lymphopoiesis, EZH2 is strongly expressed
in proliferating cells, such as human germinal center B
cells, cycling T and B lymphocytes and plasmablasts,
suggesting an important role in cell cycle regulation
and in lymphocyte division [25-27]. In agreement with
this hypothesis, lower levels of H3K27me3 and other
histone methylation marks are observed in resting B-cells
compared with activated and cycling cells. The histone
H3.3 variant accumulates in non-cycling cells and directly
reflects the length of time lymphocytes remain quiescent
[28]. This suggests that canonical H3K27me3 could be
replaced by the H3.3 variant that is not methylated at K27
[29, 30].
On the other hand, EZH2 is down-regulated during
B-cell differentiation and maturation [27]. The authors
of this study suggested that EZH2 is a component of the
checkpoint mechanism that controls pro-B to pre-B cell
transition [27]. EZH2 regulates pre-B cell receptor (preBCR) expression in pro-B cells. This receptor is essential

involvement in hematopoiesis was first revealed by
its interaction with VAV [18], an important effector in
hematopoietic signal transduction [19].
As EZH2, EED or SUZ12 loss-of-function
mutations increase the activity of hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells, PRC2 could contribute
to their negative control [20]. EZH2 overexpression in
HSCs prevents exhaustion of their long-term repopulating
potential during serial transplantation [18, 21, 22].
Therefore, EZH2 could prevent stem cell senescence
[18] by regulating adult HSC differentiation, but not their
self-renewal capacity [22-24]. EZH2 also increases the
pool of quiescent HSCs by supporting their proliferation
and inhibiting apoptosis. However, EZH2 inactivation
has opposite effects on apoptosis and proliferation in
multi-potent progenitors compared with long-term HSCs
(LT-HSCs) [23]. In LT-HSCs, EZH2 is associated with
hematopoietic differentiation and function, cellular growth
and proliferation and survival [24].
One of the critical issues for understanding the role
of EZH2 in hematopoiesis is to find, among the thousands
of genes bound and modified by PRC2, the key targets of
its transcriptional regulation. CDKN2A is one of the most
important Polycomb target loci in mammals. CDKN2A
negatively regulates cell proliferation through the RB/
p53 pathway and is repressed by EZH2. However, EZH2
requirement for HSC proliferation and differentiation is

Figure 1: Polycomb complex-mediated transcription repression. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) contains four core

components. EZH2 (Enhancer-of-zeste homolog 2) is the catalytic sub-unit, whereas EED (Embryonic Ectoderm Development), SUZ12
(zinc finger) and RBAP46/48 (Retinoblastoma Binding Protein) contribute to improving EZH2 activity. PRC2 induces EZH2-mediated
H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) to repress its target genes. The H3K27me3 mark is recognized by the CBX subunit of Polycomb
Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). Then, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RING1A ubiquitinylates histone H2A at lysine 119, strengthening
gene transcription repression.

for B-cell maturation, by directing both cell cycle exit
and Igκ recombination at the pre-B cell stage. It has been
proposed that H3K27me3 mark on the VhJ558 gene allows
the specific targeting of the recombination machinery,
DNA cleavage and gene rearrangement in pro-B cells [27].
Another study suggested that EZH2 could inhibit
pro- to pre-B cell differentiation by interacting with
STAT5. Activation of the IL7 receptor and STAT5 would
lead to EZH2 recruitment, repression of Igκ transcription
and inhibition of its recombination [31]. STAT5 and
EZH2 also act together to repress a significant subset of
genes during B-cell lymphopoiesis [31]. Moreover, EZH2
controls B-cell differentiation and immunoglobulin heavy
chain (IgH) gene rearrangement during mouse B-cell
development [21, 22].
During B-cell differentiation, EZH2 also blocks
DNA repair response pathways in activated B-cells,
thus allowing their survival following ActivationInduced cytidine Deaminase (AID)-mediated somatic
hypermutation of Ig genes [32] (Figure 3).

prognosis in different cancer types [12-14]. More
recently, EZH2 gain-of-function somatic mutations have
been discovered [15-17]. These results led academic
laboratories and pharmaceutical companies to develop
molecules to target EZH2.

Increased EZH2 expression
A number of studies have shown that EZH2
overexpression plays a major role in the physiopathology
of several hematological malignancies by promoting
cell proliferation and inducing tumor cell phenotypes.
High EZH2 expression in lymphomas is correlated with
increased proliferation, tumor cell aggressiveness and poor
prognosis [33, 34]. EZH2 is also overexpressed in 100%
of Burkitt lymphomas (BL), 87.5% of grade 3 follicular
lymphomas (FL) and 85.7% of diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBCL) [33].
Similarly, EZH2 overexpression in natural killer
(NK)/T-cell lymphomas is associated with a growth
advantage and poor prognosis [35]. EZH2 is also strongly
expressed in mantle cell lymphomas where high EZH2
expression is correlated with aggressiveness and poor
prognosis [36, 37]. Increased EZH2 expression in these
malignancies is partly due to MYC-mediated inhibition of
miR-26 and miR-101, two microRNAs that target EZH2
[35, 38].
In the B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

hematological

During the last ten years, EZH2 has generated
much interest as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.
First, EZH2 overexpression was correlated with tumor
cell aggressiveness, metastasis development and poor

Figure 2: EZH2 mutations in hematological malignancies. EZH2 has several functional domains: the WD-40 binding domain
(WDB) that interacts with EED; domain 1 (D1); domain 2 (D2) that interacts with SUZ12; the domains SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR and TFIIIB
(SANT) that interact with histones; a cysteine-rich domain (CXC); and the suppressor of variegation 3-9, enhancer of zeste and trithorax
(SET) catalytic domain. Several EZH2 mutations have been identified in different hematological malignancies: lymphoma (purple star),
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS) (blue stars) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma
(T-ALL) (orange stars).

Nalm-6 cell line, EZH2 overexpression is correlated
with silencing of tumor suppressor genes (p21, p53 and
PTEN) [39]. More recently, it has been reported that
EZH2 is significantly overexpressed in tumor cells from
patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia compared with
paired healthy B-cells [40]. This increased expression
is correlated with hyper-lymphocytosis, chromosomal
abnormalities, high ZAP-70 expression and poor prognosis
[40].
In several cancers, EZH2 expression is significantly
correlated with expression of MMSET, a histone
methyltransferase that regulates transcription and
oncogenesis in multiple myeloma (MM) harboring t(4;14)
translocations [41]. EZH2 positively regulates MMSET
expression at the post-transcriptional level by repressing
the expression of miR-26a, miR-31 and miR-203, thus
promoting tumor development [41]. Moreover, MMSEToverexpressing cells are more sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors
[42].

Other studies support a potential role for EZH2 in
MM pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are
still poorly understood. Global gene expression profiling
indicated that EZH2 is up-regulated in monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
and aggressive myeloma cells compared with normal
plasma cells [43]. Moreover, H3K27me3 target genes
are down-regulated in MGUS and MM compared with
normal bone marrow plasma cells [44]. In human MM
cell lines (HMCL), EZH2 expression has been correlated
with proliferation and growth factor independence [45].
Moreover, EZH2 expression is required in HMCL with
activated N-RAS and K-RAS proliferative phenotypes
[45]. Inhibition of EZH2 expression and activity, and thus
loss of Polycomb target gene repression, is associated
with HMCL growth inhibition [46, 47] and decreased
tumor load and survival in a mouse model of MM [44].
Although these effects were correlated with decreased
EZH2 expression, the inhibitors used in these studies

Figure 3: EZH2 biological functions during normal B-cell differentiation and lymphomagenesis. During normal B-cell

differentiation, EZH2 expression is induced when naive B-cells enter the germinal center for affinity maturation and antibody class switching.
Through H3K27 tri-methylation, EZH2 represses the expression of negative cell cycle regulators (CDKN2A and CDKN1A) and of B- cell
differentiation transcription factors (BLIMP1 and IRF4), leading to immature B-cell expansion. EZH2 also inhibits DNA damage response
pathways, allowing survival of B-cells during AID-mediated somatic hypermutation of Ig genes. EZH2 expression decreases when B-cells
exit the germinal centers, leading to de-repression of EZH2 target genes to support plasma cell maturation. Conversely, activating mutations
or EZH2 overexpression lead to an imbalance due to increased repression of EZH2 target genes, induction of proliferation and blockade of
B-cell maturation. Additional oncogenic hits (c-MYC or BCL2 deregulation) will then further promote cell transformation.

were not specific [48]. Therefore, specific inhibitors of
EZH2 enzymatic activity are required to precisely define
its roles in MM. Finally, one study reported that EZH2
is overexpressed in the side population cells of MM cell
lines. These side population cells, which are characterized
by their ability to export Hoechst dye and by CD138
expression, actively proliferate and show tumor-initiating
potential [49].
Altogether, these studies suggest an involvement of
EZH2 in MM initiation/development and aggressiveness,
but its role in this malignancy still need to be fully
characterized.
A correlation between EZH2 overexpression
and myeloid leukemia development has also been
described [50]. EZH2 is highly expressed in high-risk
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) arising from a pre-existing MDS.
Specifically, EZH2 is significantly overexpressed in MDS
and AML primary tumor cells that display aberrant DNA
methylation of the gene encoding the tumor suppressor
p15INK4B compared with tumors where p15INK4B is not
methylated [51].
In mice, Ezh2 overexpression in HSCs leads to
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) [23]. In this
model, several genes associated with HSC maintenance
are regulated by EZH2, including the transcriptional
regulators Evi-1 and Ntrk3 that are aberrantly expressed
in hematological malignancies [23]. In another AML
murine model, Ezh2 loss inhibits cancer cell proliferative
capacity and disrupts tumor progression by re-activating
EZH2 target genes that are implicated in myeloid cell
differentiation [52]. These results obtained in several
mouse models highlight EZH2 oncogenic function in
myeloid cells.
EZH2 overexpression in cancer cells may result
from different mechanisms. EZH2 up-regulation has been
linked to gene amplification in several solid cancers [53],
but not in hematological malignancies. Alternatively,
increased expression and/or activity of EZH2 positive
regulators could lead to EZH2 overexpression. For
instance, in hematological malignancies, c-MYC
is deregulated by different mechanisms, including
chromosome rearrangements, amplification, mutations and
also epigenetic mechanisms, such as aberrant microRNA
regulation [54-59]. Enhancement of EZH2 expression by
c-MYC has been described in prostate cancer and AML
[60, 61]. Therefore, a link between c-MYC deregulation
and EZH2 overexpression could be involved in the
physiopathology of hematological malignancies. On the
other hand, overexpression of the ETS DNA binding
protein ERG in a CML cell line is associated with drug
resistance and repression of DNA chromatin remodeling
genes, including the PRC2 members SUZ12 and EZH2
[62]. Other transcription factors, such as HIF1α, ELK1,
EWS-FLI1, E2F, ATAD2/ANCCA, NF-YA, STAT3 and
BRAF, can modulate EZH2 gene expression in solid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancers [63-73]. As their expression/activity is also
deregulated in hematological malignancies, it could be
important to analyze their role in normal hematopoiesis
and during tumorigenesis.

Somatic mutations leading to EZH2 gain of
function
Recurrent heterozygous mutations that target
specifically Y641 in the SET catalytic domain within
the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) pocket of EZH2 were
described in germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (GCB DLBCL) and in FL and are found in
22% of patients [17]. Other recurrent somatic mutations
were identified at A677 and A687 of the EZH2 SET
domain [15-17, 74] (Figure 2). These mutations are less
frequent and are detected only in 1 to 2% of patients with
DLBCL or FL. Unlike wild type EZH2 that preferentially
targets non-methylated or mono-methylated lysine
27 of H3 (H3K27 or H3K27me1), EZH2Y641 mutants
preferentially target di-methylated lysine 27 of H3
(H3K27m2), and have a weaker activity on H3K27 and
H3K27me1 [16, 75]. The EZH2A677G mutant methylates
H3K27, H3K27me1 and H3K27me2, whereas EZH2A677V
targets preferentially H3K27me1 [16]. In agreement,
lymphoma cell lines harboring EZH2Y641 or EZH2A677
display significantly higher H3K27me3 and lower
H3K27me2 levels [16, 75]. Both histone modifications
lead to inhibition of target gene expression, although it
was suggested that H3K27me3 is associated with a more
repressive chromatin state than H3K27me2 [76, 77]. How
a decrease in H3K27me2 level contributes to the biology
of EZH2-mutated lymphoma cells is not known. Although
EZH2 inhibition induces the loss of di- and tri-methylation
in all characterized lymphoma cell lines, independently
of their EZH2 mutational status, cell lines with EZH2
activating mutations that lead to higher H3K27me3 are
more sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors than cells harboring
wild type EZH2 [16, 78]. As H3K27me3 is a repressive
mark, EZH2 inhibition in sensitive cell lines leads to
expression of H3K27me3 target genes. Surprisingly,
in cell lines that are not responsive to EZH2 inhibition,
there are very few transcriptional changes, although
H3K27me2/3 is completely lost [16]. These results suggest
that inhibition of H3K27 methylation is not sufficient on
its own to induce target gene transcription in unresponsive
cell lines, and that other factors are implicated. Therefore,
it would be interesting to target redundant epigenetic
repressive marks (such as DNA methylation, H3K9 diand tri-methylation), or the absence of activation marks,
such as H3K4 tri-methylation or H3K27 acetylation
(H3K27ac), to sensitize tumor cells to EZH2 inhibition.
For instance, in DLBCL harboring EZH2 gain-of-function
mutations, the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects induced
by a histone deacetylase 1/2 (HDAC1/2) inhibitor were
2288

Oncotarget

correlated with increased H3K27ac at genes involved in
the DNA damage response or apoptosis. This treatment did
not induce loss of H3K27me3 globally, but only at genes
involved in the DNA damage response, thus leading to
DSB repair impairment and apoptosis. This study suggests
that EZH2 gain-of-function mutations represent a survival
advantage for DLBCL cells by improving DNA damage
repair processes [79]. In mice, the presence of EZH2Y641
mutations is correlated with higher number of germinal
center B cells, germinal center hyperplasia and lymphoid
transformation. This phenotype is associated with aberrant
EZH2 expression in tumor cells [80]. EZH2 deregulation
interferes with the finely regulated balance between
germinal center B cell proliferation and differentiation,
blocking them in a proliferative and immature state, which
constitutes a key determinant in lymphoma development
[32, 80]. EZH2 gain-of-function mutations are not
sufficient on their own for lymphoma development;
however, they represent a driving hit in lymphoid
transformation, in association with the deregulation of
other genes, such as c-MYC or BCL2 [80, 81] (Figure 3).

mostly through activation of the NOTCH signaling
pathway. Moreover, in mice injected with T-ALL cells,
EZH2 inhibition is associated with significantly higher
tumorigenic potential and mortality [88, 89].
Many studies on the involvement of Polycomb
group proteins in cancer initiation and development have
highlighted their dual role as oncogenes/tumor suppressors
[15-17, 35, 83-88]. Accumulating evidence shows that
PRC2 inhibits the proliferative and self-renewal potential
of immature lymphoid progenitors [22-24] and that
enhanced EZH2 activity specifically stimulates mature cell
proliferation [25-27]. Therefore, it could be hypothesized
that Polycomb group proteins act as oncogenes in
differentiated cells, such as B, NK or NKT cells [32,
80, 81], and as tumor suppressors in undifferentiated
cells, such as HSCs/progenitor cells [87]. Experimental
modulation of EZH2 expression in a cell-stage specific
manner during hematopoiesis might help validating this
hypothesis and improving our understanding of EZH2 role
in hematological malignancies.

EZH2 functions not related to H3K27 methylation

Somatic mutations leading to EZH2 loss of
function

The growth advantage associated with increased
EZH2 expression in NK/T-cell lymphoma cells is
independent of its H3K27 methylation activity. Indeed,
overexpressed EZH2 deregulates tumor cell proliferation
by directly inducing CCND1 transcription [35]. This
H3K27me3-independent function in transcriptional
activation has also been observed in breast and prostate
cancer [90-92], suggesting a possible switch of EZH2
from silencer to activator during tumorigenesis in some
cancers.
Concerning its silencing role, in addition to
deposition of H3K27me3, the PRC2 complex can recruit
HDACs and DNMTs that enhance its transcriptional
repression activity. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors
results in EZH2 expression down-regulation in tumor
cells, suggesting that PRC2 and HDACs collaborate in
the epigenetic control of gene expression [93]. EZH2 can
also directly interact with DNMTs [94]. Analysis of the
DNA methylation profile of lymphoma cells revealed a
significant enrichment in Polycomb complex target genes
[95]. These data indicate that H3K27me3 and DNA
methylation cooperate in repressing PRC2 target genes
associated with lymphomagenesis.

On the other hand, several studies have shown that
H3K27me3 inhibition also contributes to the development
of hematological malignancies [83, 84]. This inhibition
can be directly caused by EZH2 inactivating mutations, or
indirectly by ASKL1 mutations that lead to loss of PRC2mediated gene repression [82]. These data suggest that
EZH2 can act not only as an oncogene, but also as a tumor
suppressor, depending on the cell context. Two studies
reported the presence of different EZH2 inactivating
mutations in myeloid hemopathies, such as myelofibrosis,
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CML), atypical
chronic myelogenous leukemia and MDS [83, 84]. EZH2
inactivating mutations are associated with significantly
shorter overall survival and event-free survival in these
patients. EZH2 loss-of-function mutations were correlated
with poor prognosis also in a cohort of patients with
myelofibrosis [85]. A recent model suggests that EZH2
inactivating mutations contribute to cancer stem cell
development through the induction of HOXA9 expression,
thus supporting myeloid progenitor self-renewal [86].
In MDS, EZH2-inactivating mutations are frequently
associated with RUNX1 mutations. In a MDS mouse
model induced by a Runx1 mutation in HSCs, Ezh2 loss
promotes MDS development, but reduces its propensity
to progress to AML [87]. EZH2-inactivating mutations
are not restricted to myeloid hemopathies. Indeed, EZH2
or SUZ12 mutations are also observed in 25% of patients
with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) [88].
Several studies demonstrated that EZH2 loss-of-function
mutations contribute to the development of T-ALL,

Targeted epigenetic therapy:
EZH2 inhibitors
Considerable efforts have been focused on the
development of EZH2 inhibitors. 3-Deazaneplanocin
(DZNep) was the first molecule developed to inhibit
EZH2 through the competitive inhibition of the
enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. This
2289

Oncotarget

results in the accumulation of adenosylhomocysteine
that inhibits methyltransferases and induces PRC2
degradation, thus leading to a decrease in EZH2 protein
level [48]. As DZNep is a broad-spectrum inhibitor
of methyltransferases, it is not considered a proper
EZH2 targeted therapy [48]. Studies carried out in mice
reported that DZNep could be of therapeutic interest as
immunomodulator for the treatment of graft versus host
disease (GvHD), underscoring the interest for allograft
protocols in hematological malignancies [96]. Specifically,
histone methylation can modulate the acquired immune
response and DZNep activates the pro-apoptotic program
in alloantigen-activated T-cells in a GvHD mouse model,
without any effect on the antitumor activity of the donor
T-cells.
The discovery of EZH2 mutations, particularly in
DLBCL, promoted research to develop specific EZH2
inhibitors [16, 78, 97, 98], such as El1. E11 is recruited
to wild type EZH2 or to Y641 mutants [98], resulting in
H3K27me3 inhibition, arrest in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle, apoptosis induction and differentiation of EZH2mutated B-cells into memory B-cells. Two other EZH2
inhibitory molecules (EPZ005787 and GSK126) were
identified independently by high-throughput screening
[16, 78]. These two highly specific EZH2 inhibitors
(500 to 1000 times more selective for EZH2 than for
other methyltransferases) target EZH2 through the same
mechanism as El1, thus inhibiting H3K27 tri-methylation

and allowing the transcriptional activation of EZH2
target genes. The milder apoptosis induction in wild type
lymphoma cell lines compared with EZH2Y641 cells (where
EZH2 catalytic activity is stronger) provided the proof
of concept of the efficiency of these inhibitors [16]. In a
xenograft mouse model of DLBCL, the GSK126 inhibitor
leads to tumor growth inhibition and significantly longer
survival in treated mice compared with untreated controls
[16].
A phase I/II multicenter clinical trial on the use of an
EZH2 inhibitor as monotherapy (E7438 or Tazemetostat)
in patients with B-cell lymphoma (GCB and non-GCB
DLBCL and grade 3 FL) or with advanced solid cancers
is currently ongoing (NCT01897571). Preliminary
results showed an acceptable safety profile in all treated
patients and objective responses in patients with relapsed
DLBCL and FL harboring, or not, EZH2 mutations. Partial
responses were observed as early as two months and up
to ten months after the beginning of treatment, and timedependent responses were reported (ClinicalTrial.gov
reference NCT01897571).
The efficiency of targeted approaches in patients
with tumors harboring EZH2-activating mutations can
be improved by using companion diagnostic tests to
identify patients with EZH2Y641 mutations [99]. Moreover,
it could be interesting to associate EZH2 inhibitors with
other inhibitors that target oncogenic pathways involved
in hematological malignancies. For instance, recent

Figure 4: Role of EZH2 deregulation in hematological malignancies. EZH2 is deregulated in several hematological

malignancies. EZH2 overexpression and gain-of-function mutations are correlated with increased proliferation of tumor cells and poor
prognosis in patients with lymphoma. However, EZH2 loss-of function mutations also can be associated with aggressiveness of some
hematological malignancies. Therefore, therapeutic molecules targeting EZH2 should not hinder EZH2 tumor-suppressor function. GC

in vitro studies have highlighted the synergy between
EZH2 inhibitors and HDACi in aggressive B-cell
lymphoma [38, 97]. These effects are mainly mediated
by EZH2 deregulation and MYC-induced microRNA
inhibition. Moreover, as EZH2 and DNMTs cooperate
in transcriptional regulation, it might be interesting
to explore the effects of associating EZH2 inhibitors
with DNA demethylating agents in B-cell lymphoma
cells. Finally, it has been reported that the combination
of the EZH2 inhibitor E7438 with a corticosteroid has
an anti-proliferative effect in GCB-like lymphoma cell
lines and sensitizes EZH2 inhibitor-resistant cell lines,
independently of EZH2 mutational status [100].

represents a promising therapeutic target (Figures 3&4). In
other tumor types, EZH2 can also have a tumor suppressor
activity. Further studies are required to elucidate this
duality between oncogenic and anti-tumor activities,
depending on the cancer type and the cellular context
(Figure 4).
The first clinical trials are currently ongoing to
determine the safety and efficiency of EZH2 inhibitors.
Preliminary clinical data in patients with DLBCL
and FL indicate limited adverse events and a timedependent objective response after monotherapy with
Tazemetostat. Moreover, H3K27 methylation status and
EZH2 expression could be used as prognostic markers to
help developing personalized medicine in hematological
malignancies. Specifically, a H3K27me3/H3K27me2
score combined with EZH2 mutational status has been
proposed for selecting patients with DLBCL who could
benefit from treatment with EZH2 inhibitors [101].
Moreover, the discovery of non-histone EZH2
substrates and of PRC2-independent EZH2 functions
opens new research directions and will probably influence
the development of a second generation of EZH2
inhibitors.
