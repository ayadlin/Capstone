ABSTRACT
Autophagy is considered as a double-edged sword. It can prolong the survival
of cancer cells and enhance its resistance to apoptosis, and paradoxically, defective
autophagy has been linked to increased tumorigenesis, but the mechanism behind
this phenomenon is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that decreased
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3)
was correlated with increased autophagy through the Akt/mTOR and Erk signaling
pathways in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We also
showed that blockage of STAT3 by NSC74859 could markedly induce apoptotic cell
death and autophagy. Meanwhile, increased autophagy inhibited apoptosis. The
pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy and STAT3 further sensitized
HNSCC cells to apoptosis. Furthermore, evidence from xenograft model proved
that suppressed STAT3 activity combined with inhibition of autophagy promoted
tumor regression better than either treatment alone. Taken together, this present
study demonstrated that autophagy alleviates apoptotic cell death in HNSCC, and
combination of inhibition of STAT3 by NSC74859 and autophagy might be a promising
new therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.

Apoptosis resistance, through which malignant
cells evade cell death, is a hallmark of cancer cells [3].
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
plays key roles in this process [4]. STAT3 is constitutively
activated in most malignant tumors [5–7], especially in
HNSCC. Increasing evidence has indicated that STAT3
inhibition in cancer cell lines can trigger growth arrest
or apoptosis [8–10]. Thus, STAT3 is a potential target in
HNSCC therapy. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism
remains obscure. Blocking the phosphorylation of STAT3
(p-STAT3) potently stimulates the autophagic flux [11].
This finding indicates that autophagy is a novel mechanism
by which HNSCC responds to STAT3 inhibition.
Autophagy is a cellular process of self-consumption
in which bulk cytoplasm, long-lived proteins, and cellular
organelles are engulfed into double-membrane vesicles

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
represents a large heterogeneous group of tumors
in the oral cavity, cheek, nasopharynx, oropharynx,
hypopharynx, and larynx. The worldwide incidence of
HNSCC exceeds 450,000 cases annually [1]. Intense
research efforts have been carried out and considerable
advances in HNSCC cancer therapy have been attained
over the past decades; however, the survival rate of
HNSCC patients has shown minimal improvement [2].
Mortality remains high because of therapy-resistant local
recurrences and distant metastases. Thus, the development
of potential alternative therapies and the discovery of
novel mechanisms underlying HNSCC initiation and
progression are necessary and urgent.

termed autophagosomes and fuse with lysosomes,
where the inner cargoes are degraded and recycled [12].
Autophagy helps tumor cells survive by conferring
apoptosis resistance; inhibition of autophagy causes
caspase-independent necrotic cell death, especially in the
presence of other therapies [13]. However, whether or
not all cancer cells show the same response to autophagy
inhibition has yet to be determined. Understanding the
interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in tumors
is crucial to identify new targets for cancer therapy and
improve therapeutic efficiency.
In the present study, we investigated the effect
of blocking STAT3 signaling by NSC74859 (also
known as S3I-201), an inhibitor of the dimerization
and phosphorylation of STAT3. NSC74859 inhibited
tumor growth by inducing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo
in HNSCC. NSC74859 also induced autophagy, which
was dependent on the Akt/mTOR and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling pathways.
Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy
sensitized NSC74859-induced apoptosis in HNSCC. Our
results provide molecular insights that the combination
of autophagic and p-STAT3 inhibitors is a promising
therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.

fmk, the level of cleaved-PARP (Supplementary Figure
S1B) and the apoptotic cells (Supplementary Figure
S1C) were significantly decreased. These results reveal
that NSC74859-induced apoptosis in CAL27 cells may
partially depend on caspase 3 activation. The in vitro
inhibition experiment was repeated in another cell line
FaDu (Supplementary Figure S2). These results indicate
that apoptosis is involved in the response of HNSCC to
NSC74859 treatment.

Targeting p-STAT3 by NSC74859 induces
autophagy in HNSCC cells
Autophagy and apoptosis often simultaneously
occur [14, 15]. Thus, we also examined whether or not
NSC74859 induces autophagy in HNSCC cells through
morphological and biochemical analyses. Upon autophagy
induction, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3
(LC3) can specifically target autophagic membranes to
form autophagosomes [12]. To monitor autophagosome
formation, we constructed a CAL27 cell line stably
expressing the GFP-LC3 fusion gene and used a fluorescent
microscope to detect GFP-LC3 punctate dot. As shown in
Figure 2A, NSC74859 exposure led to an obvious punctate
pattern of LC3II immunofluorescence staining in CAL27
cells compared with the negative controls. The results of
fluorescent microscopy showed that the formation of GFPLC3-labeled vacuoles increased; consistently, the results of
Western blot demonstrated the dose-dependent conversion
of LC3I to LC3II. Two other well-established autophagy
markers were validated in NSC74859-treated cells
through Western blot analysis: enhancement of Beclin1,
a component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
complex essential for autophagosome formation [16];
degradation of p62, a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated
substrates [17] (Figure 2B).
Autophagy is a dynamic process of flux; thus,
the increased levels of autophagosomes can signify
either the induction of autophagy or the blockage
of the downstream lysosomal processing of these
autophagosomes, or both [18]. Bafilomycin A1 (Baf
A1), a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar-type H+ATPase, prevents autophagy at a late stage by inhibiting
the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes.
To monitor autophagic flux, we measured the levels
of LC3II and GFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes in
the absence or presence of Baf A1. We found that a
Baf A1 challenge increased the level of GFP–LC3positive autophagosomes (Figure 2C) and LC3II in
CAL27 cells treated with 100 μM NSC74859 (Figure
2D). The above experiment was repeated in the FaDu
cell line and yielded consistent results (Supplementary
Figure S3). These results demonstrated that NSC74859
treatment induced autophagic flux in human HNSCC
cells in vitro.

RESULTS
Blocking phosphorylation of STAT3 by
NSC74859 induces HNSCC cell death
We investigated the effects of blocking STAT3
phosphorylation by NSC74859 (S3I-201) on apoptosis
in HNSCC cell lines CAL27 and FaDu. Cultured
CAL27 cells were treated with NSC74859 at increasing
concentration. Hoechst nuclear staining was used
to test cell apoptosis in NSC74859-treated HNSCC
CAL27 cells; Figure 1A shows a positive staining of
chromatin condensation. Treatment with NSC74859
increased TUNEL-positive cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Supplementary Figure S1A). CAL27 cells
were also analyzed by flow cytometry after Annexin
V-FITC and PI dual labeling. As shown in Figure
1B, cells were treated with different concentration of
NSC74859 for 24 h or 100 μM NSC74859 for 6, 12,
and 24 h (Figures 1B and 1C). This treatment increased
the percentage of apoptotic cells. Western blot analysis
showed that the level of cleaved PARP (Cl-PARP) and
cleaved-caspase 3 (Cl-casp3) increased with decreasing
p-STAT3T705 expression; this effect was dose and time
dependent (Figures 1D and 1E). To further demonstrate
whether NSC74859-induced apoptosis in CAL27 cells
was correlated to the activation of caspase3, a pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl Val-Ala-Asp
(O-methyl)-fluoro-methylketone (z-VAD-fmk) was
employed. The results showed that when NSC74859
was combined with the treatment of 20 μM of z-VADwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

apoptosis in HNSCC cells

[22]. Compared with CAL27 cells that incubated
with NSC74859 alone, Pretreatment with 3-MA
obviously decreased LC3II but increased cleaved PARP
expression, indicating an elevated apoptosis process
compared with NSC74859 treatment alone (Figure
3A). Moreover, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining showed
that pretreatment of CAL27 cells with 3-MA induced a
higher percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure 3B) when
compared with NSC74859-treated alone, whereas

Autophagy may serve as a pro-survival or prodeath mechanism in different cellular contexts [18–
21]. 3-MA, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor
which prevents the induction of autophagosomes to
inhibit autophagy flux, was employed to elucidate the
mechanism by which autophagy acts in our system

cells treatment with 3-MA alone showed limited
apoptosis-inducing effects on CAL27 cells. To monitor
autophagic flux, we also measured the levels of LC3II
and cleaved PARP in the absence or presence of CQ.
We found that a CQ challenge increases the level of
LC3II and cleaved PARP in CAL27 cells treated with
100 μM NSC74859 (Figure 3C). Moreover, Annexin
V-FITC/PI staining showed that pretreatment of CAL27
cells with CQ increased the number of apoptotic cells
(Figure 3D).
Pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy
may exhibit autophagy-independent actions [15].
To verify the pro-survival action of autophagy, the

effects of NSC74859 were examined in cells in which
autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5), an essential protein
for autophagosome formation [23], was downregulated
by the transient transfection of dominant negative Atg5
(DN-Atg5K130R), which inhibits Atg12 conjugation
and autophagosome formation [24, 25]. As shown in
Figure 3E, transient transfection of DN-Atg5K130R into
CAL27 cells lowered LC3II level but increased cleaved
PARP level after NSC74859 treatment compared with
that in vector control. This result correlated with the
obviously decreased expression of the Atg5-Atg12
complex as detected by Western blot analysis. In
addition, flow cytometry showed that the population

analysis showed that NSC74859 decreased the levels
of p-AktS473 and p-mTORS2448. Furthermore, p-S6S235/236
as the downstream substrate of mTOR was significantly
decreased (Figure 4A). To further investigate the role
of Akt/mTOR signaling in autophagy induced by
NSC74859, a plasmid expressing the myristoylated
and constitutively active form of the Akt1 protein
(Myr-Akt) was applied [26]. As expected, overexpression of activated Akt can alleviate NSC74859induced autophagy (Figure 4B). Several studies
reported that the Erk signaling cascade stimulates
autophagy by interacting with LC3 [27, 28]. However,
whether and how the Erk cascade regulates autophagy
remains unknown. In the present study, the level of

in CAL27 cells treated with different concentration
of NSC74859 for 24 h (Figure 4C) or with 100 μM
NSC74859 for 6, 12, and 24 h (Figure 4D). To further
investigate the role of Erk in autophagy induced by
NSC74859, the Erk inhibitor U0126 was employed

to block the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. The levels of
LC3-II and p-Erk1/2T202/204 decreased in CAL27 cells,
indicating that autophagy was suppressed by inhibiting
p-Erk1/2T202/204 expression (Figure 4E). These results
suggested that NSC74859 increases autophagy by
inhibiting p-mTORS2448 and increasing p-Erk1/2T202/204.

Targeting autophagy and STAT3 signaling
blocks tumor growth in vivo

combination treatment decreased tumor size and weight
(Figures 5A and 5B). Immunohistochemical results
revealed that the combination of NSC74859 and CQ
decreased p-STAT3T705 and Bcl2 expression but enhanced
LC3 conversion and p62 expression in the CAL27
xenografts compared with NSC74859 alone (Figure 5C).
Meanwhile, Western blot analysis showed that the
levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase3 increased
with increasing LC3 (Figures 5D and 5E). These data
indicated that targeting autophagy and STAT3 signaling
reduced the tumor volume and growth rate of HNSCC
cells in vivo.

Based on the in vitro findings, we investigated
whether or not the autophagy inhibitor CQ can
enhance the antitumor effect of NSC74859 in vivo.
A xenograft tumor model was established by the
subcutaneous inoculation of CAL27 cells into nude
mice. Throughout the course of treatment, NSC
74859 (5 mg/kg body weight) did not cause visible
side effects or change in body weight of the mice.
The antitumor ability of NSC74859 combined with
CQ was stronger than that of NSC74859 alone; this

tissue

marker LC3 (P = 0.0340, r = –0.2634) (Figure 6B).
These observations are consistent with other reports
[5, 29] and suggest that HNSCC tumor cells frequently
produce high levels of p-STAT3.

Immunohistochemistry for p-STAT3T705 was
performed on 57 HNSCC tissues and 10 normal oral
mucosa tissues to determine whether or not p-STAT3T705
expression is linked to HNSCC in human. Compared
with normal oral mucosa samples, human HNSCC
tissues had significantly higher p-STAT3T705 expression
in the nucleus (Figure 6A). Using hierarchical clustering
analysis, the relationships of p-STAT3, LC3, LAMP2 and
p-Erk1/2 in HNSCC were displayed in a visual image.
Of interest, the expression of p-STAT3, LC3, LAMP2
and p-Erk1/2 in most of the HNSCC cases (cluster 2)
were distinct from normal mucosa (cluster 1), reflecting
the significant differences in p-STAT3, LC3, LAMP2
and p-Erk1/2 staining in HNSCC (Figure 6C). Clustering
analyses of immunohistochemistry of HNSCC and
normal oral mucosa tissues showed that p-STAT3T705
expression positively correlated with LAMP2 (P =
0.0003, r = 0.4315) and p-Erk1/2T202/204 (P = 0.0055, r
= 0.3408) but negatively correlated with the autophagic

DISCUSSION
In this study, we conducted in vitro and in vivo
experiments to determine whether or not p-STAT3T705
blockade using NSC74859 could induce HNSCC cell death
and autophagy. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of
autophagy sensitized HNSCC cells to NSC74859-induced
apoptosis. Evidence from a xenograft model proved that
suppressing STAT3 activity and inhibiting autophagy
can promote tumor regression better than using either
treatment alone. These results indicate that autophagy
plays a pro-survival role in NSC74859-induced cell
death in HNSCC cells. In particular, NSC74859-induced
autophagy through blockade of STAT3 signaling pathway
is correlated with the Akt/mTOR and Erk pathways.
STAT3 is a transcription factor that can be activated
by IL-6, EGF, and other cytokines [30]. STAT3 plays
a key role in various biological processes, including

inflammation, cell proliferation, migration, survival, and
metabolic disorders [31]. Subsequently, the potential
oncogenic role of STAT3 was established because
constitutive STAT3 activation has been detected in nearly
70% of human epithelial malignancies and hematopoietic
malignancies, where increased STAT3 expression is
commonly associated with a poor clinical prognosis [4, 30,
32]. In the present study, immunohistochemical analysis
of HNSCC and normal oral mucosa tissues verified that
p-STAT3 expression was dramatically increased in human
HNSCC tissues. These observations are consistent with
other reports [5, 29] and suggest that HNSCC tumor cells
frequently produce high levels of p-STAT3.
STAT3 is an attractive therapeutic target because
its development and regulation display an oncogenic
phenotype [5, 33]. Sen et al. found that the JAK kinase
inhibitor AZD1480 abrogates STAT3 activation and
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumor growth
[34]. Peyser et al. reported that PTPRT is frequently
hypermethylated in HNSCC and PTPRT promoter and
methylation is significantly associated with sensitivity
to STAT3 inhibition in HNSCC cells [35]. Study by
Bonner et al. suggested that head and neck cancer cells
were more sensitive to cetuximab after the inhibition of
STAT-3 by an inhibiting short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
knockdown approach [36]. Sen et al. [37] generated
a double-stranded STAT3 oligonucleotide decoy and
conducted a clinical trial in head and neck tumors.
However, the results of initial clinical trials that utilized
STAT3 inhibitors are unsatisfactory. Blocking p-STAT3
potently stimulates the autophagic flux [11]. However,
whether or not autophagy promotes cell death or enhances
survival remains controversial. Drug-induced autophagy
of tumor cells has been reported [38, 39], but most studies
support the survival role of autophagy in chemotherapyinduced cell death [40, 41]. Therefore, the potential cause
of treatment failure in these settings may be the prosurvival role of autophagy induced by STAT3 inhibitors.
Considering that the pharmacological or genetic inhibition
of autophagy promotes NSC74859-induced apoptosis, we
speculated that NSC74859-mediated autophagy is a prosurvival mechanism rather than a pro-death mechanism.
These observations are consistent with other reports
[42]. A xenograft tumor model was established by the
subcutaneous inoculation of CAL27 cells into nude
mice treated with both NSC74859 and CQ. Co-treatment
reduced tumor volume compared with NSC74859 alone,
indicating that blocking the autophagic flux can enhance
the efficacy of NSC74859 on HNSCC cells.
Possible proteins involved were detected in
xenografts and HNSCC cells through Western blot and
immunohistochemistry to further explore the mechanism
by which targeting STAT3 triggers cell death and
autophagy, as well as to elucidate the role of p-STAT3T705
in each process. At least 30 autophagy-related genes have
been identified [43]. mTOR is an autophagy-related gene

that negatively modulates autophagosome formation in
eukaryotic cells [44]. In the present research, we evaluated
the level of phosphorylated mTOR to detect whether or
not mTOR is involved in NSC74859-induced autophagy.
NSC74859 treatment decreased the phosphorylation
levels of Akt and mTOR as well as the phosphorylation
substrates of mTOR (p-S6S235/236) in CAL27 cells.
This result indicates that the Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway is involved in NSC74859-induced autophagy
in CAL27 cells. The Erk signaling cascade plays a key
role in autophagy regulation [45, 46]. However, the
mechanism underlying this regulation process has yet to
be elucidated. The present results verified the importance
of Erk activation in NSC74859-induced autophagy. The
level of p-Erk1/2T202/204 increased in CAL 27 cells treated
with different concentration of NSC74859 for 24 h. The
Erk phosphorylation inhibitor U0126 was employed to
further confirm the role of Erk1/2 in NSC74859-induced
autophagy [47]. Treatment with 100 μM NSC74859 and
20 μM U0126 for 24 h decreased the levels of LC3II
and p-Erk1/2T202/204 in CAL27 cells. This result suggests
that autophagic flux can be suppressed by inhibiting the
phosphorylation of Erk1/2.
Overall, the present study proved that inhibiting
STAT3 signaling by NSC74859 could induce autophagy
and apoptosis in HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and
that autophagy induced by NSC74859 plays a pro-survival
role. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy
sensitized HNSCC cells to NSC74859-induced apoptosis.
Moreover, the Akt/mTOR and Erk pathways were
involved in NSC74859-induced autophagy in HNSCC
cells. This interaction may provide significant benefits to
HNSCC patients, particularly in combination with other
anti-STAT3 agents, because STAT3 has diverse functions
and is almost universally activated in HNSCC cancer
cells. Therefore, suppressing autophagy can enhance the
efficacy of STAT3 signaling blockage on HNSCC cells,
and this process might be a promising therapeutic strategy
for HNSCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and reagents
NSC74859 was purchased from Selleck
(Houston, TX). Bafilomycin A1, 3-Methyladenine
(3-MA) and Chloroquine (CQ) was obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). U0126 was obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA). Lipofectamine 2000 was
bought from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Stock solutions
were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), stored at
− 20°C, and diluted in fresh medium for each experiment.
The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.1%
in any of the experiments to prevent toxicity to cells.
The expression vectors encoding dominant negative
Atg5 mutant (pCIneo-DN-Atg5K130R), as well as the

Biology, Okazaki, Japan) [25].

with i.p. injections of NSC74859 (5 mg/kg body weight)
for 21 consecutive days until the mice were killed, whereas
the control group (n = 5) received equal volume of PBS
only. For CQ and NSC74859 co-treatment experiment, the
experimental group (n = 5) was treated with i.p. injections
of NSC74859 (5 mg/kg body weight) and CQ (250 mg/
kg body weight) for 21 consecutive days until the mice
were killed, whereas the control group (n = 5) received CQ
(250 mg/kg body weight) only. Throughout the course of
treatment, the mice were monitored daily for any discomfort
and weighed every other day to check for physical
condition. Tumor volumes were calculated to determine the
tumor growth according to the formula (width2 × length)/2
as previous described [49].

Cell lines
Human HNSCC cell lines CAL27 and FaDu were
bought from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco)
[48]. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of
95% air 5% CO2 at 37°C and experiments were performed
on 4th and 5th passages generated from the frozen stock.

Nuclear morphology assessment by Hoechst
33258 staining

Western blot analysis

CAL27 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture
plates for 24 h and incubated with different concentration
of NSC74859 (0 to 200 μM) for 24 h with detailed
procedure as previous described [48].

Western blot analysis were performed as previously
described with details in Supplementary Material and
Methods [48].

Apoptosis assay

Human HNSCC tissue microarray

Apoptosis was quantified with an Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego,
CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions as
previous described [49].

Human HNSCC tissue microarray HN803a
including 57 confirmed paraffin-embedded HNSCC
and 10 normal oral mucosa specimens were obtained
from US Biomax with detailed clinical and pathological
information as previous describe [52].

GFP-LC3 analysis

Immunohistochemistry, hierarchical clustering
and data visualization

CAL27 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were
obtained by transfecting the cells with EGFP-LC3
plasmid and selected with G418. Transfection using
Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent was carried out according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. After transfection, cells
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and fresh DMEM was added for further incubation.
The formation of GFP-LC3 punctate structures was
examined as previously described [50]. The images were
photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Leica,
Brunswick, Germany).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hierarchical
clustering were performed as described previously [53].
Firstly, immunohistochemical analyses of human tumor
samples were converted into scaled values centered at
zero in Microsoft Excel, then the Pearson’s correlation
coefficient was carried out with Cluster 3.0 with average
linkage to achieve the hierarchical analysis results were
visualized using the Java Tree View 1.1.6 version. Finally,
the clustered data were arranged with markers on the
horizontal axis and tissue samples on the vertical axis.
Biomarkers with a close relationship are located next to
each other.

Animal studies
All proposals were approved and supervised by the
institutional animal care and use committee of Wuhan
University [51]. Institutional guidelines for the proper and
humane use of animals in research were followed. Female
BALB/c nude mice (18–20 g) with 6–8 weeks of age were
housing in the Experimental Animal Center of Wuhan
University in pressurized ventilated cages according to
institutional regulations. CAL27 cells (2 × 106 in 0.2 mL of
medium) were inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of
the mice. After 14 days, tumor-bearing mice were randomly
divided into four groups. Treatment with NSC74859 or
CQ or both of them was started 14 days after inoculation
of the cells. The experimental group (n = 5) was treated

Statistical analysis
All the data were presented as mean ± SEM. Data were
analyzed and visualized using Graph-Pad Prism 5.0. Oneway analysis of variance followed by post Tukey Test were
used to determine statistical differences between treatment
groups. All experiments were independently repeated in
triplicate. P < 0.05 was regarded as statistical significance;
all tests were two-sided and no corrections were applied for
multiple significance testing. * or #, ** or ##, and *** indicated
P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively.
