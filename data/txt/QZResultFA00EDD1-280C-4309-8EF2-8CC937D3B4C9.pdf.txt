Expression and Immunotherapeutic Targeting of the SSX
Family of Cancer–Testis Antigens in Prostate Cancer
Heath A. Smith, Robert J. Cronk, Joshua M. Lang, and Douglas G. McNeel

Abstract
Recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the first immunotherapy for prostate cancer
encourages efforts to improve immune targeting of this disease. The synovial sarcoma X chromosome
breakpoint (SSX) proteins comprise a set of cancer–testis antigens that are upregulated in MHC class I–deficient
germline cells and in various types of advanced cancers with a poor prognosis. Humoral and cell-mediated
immune responses to the SSX family member SSX2 can arise spontaneously in prostate cancer patients. Thus,
SSX2 and other proteins of the SSX family may offer useful targets for tumor immunotherapy. In this study, we
evaluated the expression of SSX family members in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor biopsies to identify
which members might be most appropriate for immune targeting. We found that SSX2 was expressed most
frequently in prostate cell lines, but that SSX1 and SSX5 were also expressed after treatment with the DNA
demethylating agent 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine. Immunohistochemical analysis of microarrayed tissue biopsies
confirmed a differential level of SSX protein expression in human prostate cancers. Notably, SSX expression in
patient tumor samples was restricted to metastatic lesions (5/22; 23%) and no expression was detected in
primary prostate tumors examined (0/73; P < 0.001). We determined that cross-reactive immune responses to a
dominant HLA-A2–specific SSX epitope (p103-111) could be elicited by immunization of A2/DR1 transgenic
mice with SSX vaccines. Our findings suggest that multiple SSX family members are expressed in metastatic
prostate cancers which are amenable to simultaneous targeting. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6785–95. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed and
second leading cause of cancer-related death among American men, and a significant health concern worldwide (1).
Organ-confined prostate cancer is initially treated by surgery
or radiation therapy; however, approximately one-third of
patients relapse, and another one-third of these patients will
ultimately develop life-threatening, castrate-resistant tumors
(1–3). Sipuleucel-T was recently U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved as the first immunotherapeutic vaccine
shown to improve overall survival in patients with castrateresistant prostate cancer (4). The success of this approach
suggests that other simpler immunotherapies could be investigated targeting additional antigens, potentially with the goal
of preventing the development of castrate-resistant metastatic
disease.

Over the course of the last decade, several prostate cancer
antigens have been evaluated in clinical trials as immunotherapeutic targets for prostate cancer therapy, including
prostate-specific antigen (5, 6), prostatic acid phosphatase
(PAP; refs. 7, 8), PSMA (9), and PSCA (10, 11). Although these
protein targets are frequently expressed by prostate cancer
cells, they are also expressed by normal prostate tissue and
may not be critical for the survival of the tumor; hence, their
expression might be downregulated by cancer cells during the
course of immune targeting or disease progression (12–16).
Thus, there remains a need to identify immune targets of
prostate cancer that are highly expressed in metastatic disease
and/or critical to the progression of the disease, as simultaneous antigen targeting may be important to prevent the
outgrowth of escape variants arising during the course of
targeted therapy.
Cancer–testis antigens (CTA) are one class of tumorassociated antigen upregulated in tumors of different histologic origin, including prostate cancer, and especially
prevalent in advanced disease (17–19). Shown in some cases
to be spontaneously immunogenic in cancer patients, these
proteins are normally only expressed in germ cells of the
testis (20–25). Because of the blood–testis barrier, a paucity
of antigen-presenting cells, and a lack of MHC molecules on
their surface, proteins exclusively expressed in germline
tissue are considered immune privileged (26, 27). Thus,
the ectopic expression of CTA in cancer tissue makes these
proteins ideal immunotherapeutic targets. NY-ESO-1 and

the MAGE family of antigens have been the most extensively
studied CTAs. Proteins of these families have been found to
be preferentially expressed in metastases over primary tumor of various histologic origin and are currently being
evaluated as target antigens in clinical trials (28, 29).
Another superfamily of CTA thought to be attractive
targets for cancer immunotherapy are the synovial sarcoma
X chromosome breakpoint (SSX) proteins (30–32). Although
the precise function of these proteins remains unknown, SSX
expression has been associated with stem cell migration,
suggesting a potential biologically important role to the
metastatic phenotype (33). The most investigated member
SSX2 has been shown to be expressed in prostate cancer
lesions at the mRNA level (34), whereas expression of other
SSX family members has been shown to be inducible with
epigenetic modifying agents (EMA) in colon carcinoma cell
lines (35). We have shown that SSX2 expression can be
upregulated in prostate cancer cell lines upon treatment
with 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (21). We have also shown that
SSX2 antibodies and SSX2 peptide-specific T cells can be
found in the peripheral blood of some patients with prostate
cancer, indicating that patients can have preexisting immune responses to SSX2 (21, 36). Because the SSX antigens
are highly immunogenic and essentially tumor specific,
these proteins might be more ideal as targets for immunotherapy than other prostate-associated antigens. However,
the relative expression of specific SSX family members in
prostate cancer cell lines and prostate tumor tissues remains
unknown. In this study, we sought to identify which SSX
proteins are expressed in prostate cancer cell lines and
tissues and, therefore, potentially relevant target antigens
for prostate cancer immunotherapy. We then next sought
to determine whether it is possible to simultaneously
target these SSX family members using immunotherapeutic
vaccines.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22-RV1, PC3, and DU-145)
and noncancer immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines
(RWPE-1 and PREC-6) were grown in RPMI 1640 media
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen),
200 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol. VCaP and LAPC4
cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
supplemented with 5% glucose, 10% FCS, 200 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mmol/L
b-mercaptoethanol. Where indicated, cells were additionally
cultured with 10 mmol/L 5-Aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-dc;
Sigma;), 100 nmol/L Trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma), or both
agents simultaneously for 72 hours. RNA was collected after
treatment using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC),
verified using polyphasic (genotypic and phenotypic) testing
to confirm identity, and passaged in our laboratory for less
than 6 months.

PCR, RT-PCR, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Gradient PCR was carried out to amplify DNA products
from SSX image clones encoding SSX1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9
cDNAs (ATCC), without cross-amplification of other SSX
family members. Image clones exclusively encoding SSX8
and SSX10 were not commercially available. Amplification
of products with SSX8 and SSX10 primers in cell lines was
consequently verified by direct DNA sequencing. SSX primers
used for PCR analysis were designed directly, or from published sequences (30, 35), and were commercially synthesized
(Integrated DNA Technologies). PCR conditions were as follows: 95 C for 1 minute followed by 30 cycles of 95 C for 1
minute, the specific annealing temperature for 1 minute, and
72 C for 3 minutes. A final extension time was 10 minutes at
72 C. Products were then separated and evaluated by agarose
gel electrophoresis.
Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using the One-Step
RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) was carried out using RNA isolated from
cell lines with the primers and annealing temperatures listed
in Table 1, as well as b-actin control primers (actinA: 50 -TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-30 , actinB: 50 -CTTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-30 ) under the following PCR
conditions: 50 C for 30 minutes, 95 C for 15 minutes, 35
cycles at 95 C for 1 minute, specific annealing temperature
for 1 minute, and 72 C for 1 minute; final extension for 10
minutes at 72 C. For quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), 1 mg
RNA was collected and reverse transcribed using qScript
cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was done using PerfeCTa
SYBR Green SuperMix for iQ (Quanta Biosciences, Inc.)
according to the manufacturer's instructions with 1 mL of
the cDNA synthesis reaction mixed with primers specific for
each family member and the SuperMix. Samples were analyzed using a MyiQ2 Two-Color Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad) with annealing temperatures as shown in
Table 1. All results were analyzed by the 2DCt method (37)
relative to the ribosomal protein P0 as a control gene (38):
P0 forward: 50 -ACAATGGCAGCATCTACAAC-30 ; P0 reverse:
50 -GCAGACAGACACTGGCAAC-30 ). Fold induction over vehicle treatment was calculated using the 2DDCt method, as
previously published (37).
Western blot
Recombinant SSX GST-tagged proteins (SSX1-5; Abnova) or
PAP protein (Fitzgerald) were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard procedures. Membranes were probed with an SSX2
monoclonal antibody (mAb; clone 1A4; Abnova) or an SSX5
polyclonal antibody (B01P; Abnova).
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were washed in xylene
and rehydrated in ethanol, followed by antigen retrieval using
Tris-EDTA buffer supplemented with 5 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.5%
Triton X-100 (pH 8.0), and 20 mg/mL Proteinase K. After
washing in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and blocking in PBS/10%
BSA, slides were stained with primary antibody overnight
at 4 C. Samples were then stained with goat anti-mouse

the LSAB System HRP kit (Dako) and DAB metal concentrate
(Pierce). Slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin,
mounted with coverslips, and imaged using an Olympus
BX51 microscope (Olympus) and SPOT RT analysis software
(Diagnostic Instruments).
HLA-A2 T2 binding affinity assays
SSX nonamer peptides, derived from the amino acid
sequences of SSX1-9 and corresponding to SSX2 epitope
p103-111, were evaluated for their predicted HLA-A2 affinity
using the SYFPEITHI and BIMAS prediction algorithms (39,
40). The purity and identity of synthesized peptides was
confirmed by mass spectrometry and gas chromatography
(United Biochemical Research). In vitro HLA-A2 affinity for
each peptide was determined by stabilization of HLA-A2 on
TAP-deficient T2 cells as previously described (35, 41).
Peptide-HLA-A2 stabilization was measured as relative
mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), normalized to vehiclepulsed T2 MFI, and all measurements were conducted in
triplicate.

and all experimental procedures were conducted under an
IACUC-approved protocol.
Immunization studies
Four- to 6-week-old A2/DR1 mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 mg of an SSX peptide or vehicle control in
complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). For DNA vaccination
studies, mice were immunized every 14 days intradermally in
the ear pinna with 100 mg of either plasmid DNA vector control
(pTVG4) or a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding SSX2 (pTVGSSX2; ref. 35). Mice were euthanized 7 (peptide immunization)
or 14 (DNA immunization) days after the last immunization,
and splenocytes were isolated by centrifugation after red
blood cell osmotic lysis.
IFNg ELISPOT
IFNg ELISPOT was done according to the manufacturer's
instructions (R&D Systems) as previously described (7, 35, 43).
Cells were incubated for 48 hours in the presence of 2 mg/mL
of each individual SSX peptide, influenza matrix protein A
peptide, 10 mg/mL concanavalin A (Calbiochem), or media
alone, prior to IFNg detection. Spots were counted with an

Results
Identification of gene-specific primers for ten SSX
family members
To evaluate mRNA expression of SSX family members,
primers and annealing temperatures were first determined
that would result in specific product amplification for each
known family member. Using the published SSX gene-specific
primers and annealing temperatures for PCR (30, 35), we
observed cross-amplification of products from image clone
DNA plasmids encoding different SSX family member cDNAs,
particularly for the SSX4, 6, 7, and 9 primer pairs (data not
shown). On the basis of these results, we designed new primers
and conducted gradient PCR to establish conditions that would
result in complete primer specificity. The primers and annealing temperatures used for these experiments are shown in
Table 1, and the location of the published and redesigned
primers within the aligned SSX sequences are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Specific amplification was observed for all
SSX primers (Fig. 1). Image clones encoding SSX8 and SSX10
were not available; however, SSX8 and SSX10 primer sets were
tested independently for cross-amplification from the available
image clones, with no amplification observed (Fig. 1B). These
primers were also tested for PCR amplification from a human
testis cDNA library. Products of the appropriate size were
found for SSX8 but not SSX10 (Fig. 1C). Amplified products
of the predicted size for SSX8 were sequenced, confirming
primer specificity and SSX8 expression in the testis.
SSX family members 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 are expressed or
inducible in prostate cell lines
Previous work by our group and others has shown that
certain CTA, including SSX2, can be induced in cancer cell lines
with EMA (21, 35). To determine which SSX members could be
potential targets for prostate cancer immunotherapy, 3 human
androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines (LAPC4, LNCaP,
and VCaP), 3 androgen-independent cell lines (22-RV1, PC3,
and DU-145), and 2 immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines
(RWPE-1 and PREC-E6) were cultured in vitro and treated with
or without 2 different EMA. Specifically, cells were treated with
a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 10 mmol/L 5-aza-dc, a
histone deacetylase inhibitor, 100 nmol/L TSA, or both agents
simultaneously, whereas untreated controls were treated with
vehicle alone. RNA was collected 72 hours after treatment for
RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2). SSX1 was expressed at baseline only in
untreated PC3 cells but was frequently inducible following
5-aza-dc treatment. SSX2 was expressed at baseline in most of
the cell lines and was inducible to varying degrees in the
androgen-independent cells and the normal prostate epithelial
cell lines. In addition, in some instances SSX3, 5, and 8 were
inducible with EMA treatment. In the case of SSX8, amplified
products were gel purified and sequenced, confirming SSX8
amplification in DU-145, LNCaP, and PREC-E6 cells, which to
our knowledge is the first identification of SSX8 expression in
any cancer cell line or tissue.

SSX family member were tested for PCR amplification using available
image clone plasmids encoding different SSX family members as template
DNA. SSX8 and SSX10 image clones were unavailable. B, SSX8 and
SSX10 primer sets were tested against the available SSX image clones.
C, SSX2, 8, and 10 primer sets were evaluated by PCR amplification from
human testis cDNA to verify specificity of SSX8 and SSX10 primers. Data
in each panel is representative of 2 independent experiments.

qRT-PCR was conducted with the same RNA samples in all
cases in which amplification was observed by RT-PCR. The
expression patterns found by RT-PCR for SSX1, 2, 3, 5, and 8
were highly similar by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3; SSX3, SSX8 not shown).
TSA did not seem to significantly induce expression either
alone or in combination with 5-aza-dc, suggesting that regulation of SSX gene expression is predominantly mediated,
directly or indirectly, by changes in DNA methylation. Overall,
these results show that SSX2 is the most commonly expressed
family member in prostate cancer cell lines, with higher (and
more frequent) expression detected relative to other SSX
family members. However, SSX1 and SSX5 expression were
frequently induced following treatment with a methylation
inhibitor. Individual cell lines could also express multiple SSX
family members.

member proteins are expressed in human prostate tumors,

and whether this expression is associated with stage of
disease. Because the SSX proteins have highly similar amino
acid sequences, the cross-reactivity to SSX1-5 GST-tagged
recombinant proteins was evaluated by Western blot. Recombinant proteins for SSX family members 6 to 10 were not
available and were thus not evaluated. We found that a mAb,
1A4, recognized SSX2 and SSX3, whereas a murine polyclonal
antibody, B01P, recognized SSX1, 3, 4, and 5, but not SSX2
(Fig. 4A). These antibodies could also detect SSX protein
expression in paraffin-embedded human testis tissue
(Fig. 4B). Using a paraffin-embedded tissue microarray, which
included biopsy samples from 95 patients with varying stages
of prostate cancer, 25 patients with high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), or benign cores from 72
control patients, we evaluated SSX expression in cancer
tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC). SSX expression
was detected in some of these tissue specimens with differential staining observed depending on which SSX antibody

www.aacrjournals.org

was used (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S2). Given the crossreactivity of these antibodies, the identification of specific SSX
family members was not possible, but the presence of staining
with 1A4 and not B01P in certain lesions, together with our
findings in cell lines, suggested that some tissues may express
only SSX2 (among SSX1–SSX5). Staining with B01P, but not
1A4, suggested that other tissues may express one or more of
the other SSX family members. In addition, the nuclear SSX
staining patterns varied among tissues; in some cases SSX
expression was homogenous, whereas in other tissues the
nuclear staining was punctate, with expression detected in
some cells but not adjacent tumor cells. Interestingly, SSX
protein expression among tumors was found exclusively in
metastatic lesions (5/22, 23%), and not in primary tumors
(0/73, P < 0.001, c2; Table 2). A single benign tissue sample was
scored positive; however, given predominantly cytoplasmic
staining, this might have been a staining artifact (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Expression of the SSX CTA in Prostate Cancer

detected in tumor biopsy
specimens from prostate cancer
patients. A, 200 ng of GST-tagged
recombinant SSX proteins
(SSX1-5) or PAP protein (negative

SSX proteins was determined by
staining with mAb (1A4) or pAb
(B01P) in Western blot. B, these
antibodies were also evaluated for
their recognition of SSX proteins in
paraffin-embedded testis tissue
by IHC. An IgG isotype control
was used as a primary antibody
negative control for staining
specificity. C, tissue microarray
slides were stained using mAb
1A4 mAb, pAb B01P, or an IgG
isotype control. Specimens were
considered positive for SSX
expression if 2 blinded observers
independently scored the cores
positive. Metastatic biopsy
samples from 3 patients with
differential SSX expression are
shown (Patient 1: bone
metastasis; patient 2: brain
metastasis; and patient 3: lymph
node metastasis). Positive and
negative staining are denoted by
"þ" and "", respectively.

T cells specific for epitope p103-111 from SSX1 and
SSX2 differentially recognize peptide p103-111 from
other SSX proteins
Ultimately, these studies were conducted to identify which
SSX family members might be attractive targets for prostate
cancer immunotherapy. The results above suggested that
SSX1, 2, and 5, and possibly SSX3 and 8, may be the most
relevant members expressed in prostate tumors. Because
these proteins are highly homologous, we next wanted to

www.aacrjournals.org

determine whether they could be immunologically targeted
following immunization with 1 SSX family member. To test
this, we focused on SSX2 as the dominant SSX family member,
with highest expression among prostate cancer cell lines, and
restricted our analysis to a single HLA-A2–restricted epitope,
SSX2 p103-111 (36). We previously identified that T cells
specific for this immunodominant epitope can be detected
in HLA-A2þ patients with advanced prostate cancer and can
lyse HLA-A2þ SSX2þ prostate cells (36). We therefore wanted

to assess whether SSX2 p103-111–specific T cells could recognize the corresponding peptide derived from other relevant
SSX family members. Using peptide-binding algorithms to
predict HLA-A2 affinity, we found that most of the corresponding p103-111 peptides from the different family members were predicted to have moderate HLA-A2 affinity
(Fig. 5A). These peptides were then synthesized and evaluated
for their in vitro HLA-A2 affinity (Fig. 5B). We found that each
SSX p103-111 peptide had affinity for HLA-A2, and this binding
corresponded with the predicted binding algorithm scores. As
a negative control, peptide p103-111 from SSX2 was modified
(SSX2-IP) to abolish HLA-A2 binding.
To evaluate whether T cells specific for SSX2 p103-111 can
recognize peptides derived from different SSX family members, we immunized HLA-A2 transgenic (A2/DR1) mice with
an SSX2-encoding DNA plasmid vaccine (36). T cells specific
for SSX2 p103-111 recognized p103-111 from SSX3/5/9, but no
other family members (Fig. 5C), suggesting that an SSX2
vaccine that elicits SSX2 p103-111 peptide-specific T cells
could also be used to target SSX3, 5, or 9. Similarly, T cells
from A2/DR1 mice immunized directly with peptide p103-111
from SSX1 or SSX2 were evaluated for cross-reactive immune
responses by IFNg ELISPOT (Fig. 5D). Again we found that
T cells specific for SSX2 p103-111 could recognize peptide
p103-111 from SSX3/5/9, whereas T cells elicited by immunization with SSX1 p103-111 cross-recognized peptides p103111 from SSX4, SSX6/8, and SSX7. Together, these results show
that multiple SSX family members can be expressed in prostate cancer and could potentially be targeted simultaneously
using immunotherapeutic vaccines.

Discussion
SSX2 mRNA expression has previously been reported in
human prostate tumor tissues (21, 34, 44). Initially, Tureci and
colleagues observed SSX2 expression in 5 of 25 prostate cancer
lesions by RT-PCR (44) and later found SSX1, 2, 4, and 5
expression in a number of different cancer tissues, however,
SSX2 was the only member found in prostate cancer lesions

(34). When SSX6-9 were subsequently identified, it was found
that SSX1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 could be induced with EMA treatment
in colon cancer cell lines (35). Prior to our study, a comprehensive study evaluating SSX family member mRNA and
protein expression had not been conducted for prostate
cancer cell lines or tumor tissues.
In this study, we have identified primers that specifically
amplify individual SSX family members. These primers were
used to evaluate SSX expression in prostate cancer cell lines by
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. We found that SSX2 mRNA transcripts
were commonly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines at
baseline, whereas SSX1 and SSX5 were frequently inducible
with EMA. To a lesser extent, SSX3 and SSX8 were also
induced (4/8 and 3/8 cell lines, respectively). Using SSX
antibodies that recognize different SSX family members, we
found that tumors can have differential SSX protein expression, and expression is essentially restricted to metastatic
lesions. We also found that T cells specific for an HLA-A2–
restricted SSX2 immunodominant epitope can recognize the
corresponding p103-111 peptide derived from other SSX family members. Cross-reactivity of SSX2 p103-specific T cells
was observed for the corresponding p103-111 peptide from
SSX3/5/9, whereas SSX1 p103-111–specific T cells seem to
recognize p103 from SSX6/8 and perhaps SSX4 and SSX7.
In contrast to previous reports, we found that published
primers for SSX4, 6, 7, and 9 led to amplification of other family
member transcripts. In our hands, SSX4 primers previously
reported amplified products from SSX2, 3, and 4 cDNA templates at the annealing temperatures published for SSX4,
whereas SSX6, 7, and 9 primers cross-amplified products from
the SSX7 and SSX9 cDNA templates (data not shown). We also
observed cross-amplification of SSX7 and SSX9 transcripts
using the published SSX5 primers. We report here a set of
primers and annealing temperatures specific to each family
member that eliminated cross-amplification (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). We believe that cross-amplification with the
original SSX4 primers is a significant finding due to the
reported expression of this family member in cell lines and
tumor tissues in numerous studies. Because we found these

representative of 2 independent experiments. C, splenocytes from individual A2/DR1 mice immunized with either DNA vaccine encoding SSX2 (pTVG-SSX2,
n ¼ 9, &) or vector control (pTVG4, n ¼ 3, *) were analyzed to determine the frequency of peptide-specific T cells by IFNg ELISPOT. Splenocytes were
stimulated with one of each of the six p103-111 peptides from the different SSX family members, SSX2-IP, influenza matrix A peptide, or a ConA positive control.
Each dot represents the frequency of peptide-specific IFNg SFU from an individual mouse, measured in triplicate with background subtracted. D, splenocytes

primers to cross-amplify SSX2, which is the most frequently
reported family member in cancer cell lines and tissues, it
could be that some reports of the frequency of SSX4 expression in various tumors are inaccurate.
The observed patterns of SSX family member expression
and induction from our studies suggest underlying epigenetic
marks in different cell lines that mediate responsiveness to
EMA agents. Differences in promoter methylation of CpG
islands, methylation of intragene cysteines, or alterations in
chromatin folding because of acetylation or methylation of
histone residues could all contribute to variations in SSX

family member expression. From our studies, the largest
induction of transcription was found after DNA methyltransferase inhibition with 5-aza-dc treatment, which is not surprising in light of previous findings that hypomethylation
events arise early in prostate cancer tumorigenesis (45–47).
Although the methylation status of CpG islands have not been
reported for the SSX gene family members, whole genome
bisulfite sequencing data from cancer cell lines is available
online through the UCSC Genome browser (48). There seem to
be no documented methylation sites or CpG islands in the
promoter region of SSX2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9, even far upstream of

the start site or within intragene regions. Methylated sites are
found in the promoter region of SSX1, and in an intragene
region of SSX5 that could account for differences in baseline
expression or inducibility. Other regulation sites or mechanisms may be present to account for the increased expression of
SSX2, 3, and 8 in some cell lines after EMA treatment. In 2 of
the 3 cell lines showing SSX8 inducibility, expression is only
present with combined 5-aza-dc and TSA treatment, suggesting that chromatin remodeling may play a role in transcriptional regulation of this family member. Future studies will
assess methylation patterns found in SSX genes at the DNA
level, before and after EMA treatment.
We also show for the first time SSX protein expression in
human prostate cancer tissues. We observed different patterns
of SSX family member protein expression in prostate tumors in
terms of member and homogeneity of staining. SSX expression
was found almost exclusively in metastatic prostate cancer
lesions as compared with primary prostate cancer lesions
(P < 0.001, c2). Expression identified here in bone, lymph node,
and brain metastases suggest that SSX protein expression is
inherent to metastatic disease, independent of tissue site.
Interestingly, primary tumor biopsies from patients with metastases (stage IV) also were SSX negative, whereas metastatic
tissues from 5 of 22 patients were SSX positive (P ¼ 0.027, c2),
further associating SSX expression specifically with metastatic
disease. These results correspond to our previous studies looking at the frequencies of SSX2 p103-111 peptide-specific T cells
in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with
prostate cancer by tetramer analysis (36). We found that
patients with advanced disease had significantly higher frequencies of SSX-specific T cells compared with healthy donors
and patients with early-stage disease, further suggesting that
these antigens may be associated with advanced prostate
cancer. These findings may or may not suggest a biological
importance of SSX expression in metastatic disease progression.
The expression of multiple SSX family members in some
metastatic prostate cancer lesions suggests that SSX immunotherapy may need to consider targeting several SSX proteins
simultaneously. We have previously identified an immunodominant SSX2 epitope (p103-111) that can elicit epitopespecific T cells in transgenic A2/DR1 mice immunized with
a plasmid vaccine encoding SSX2 (36). Cross-reactivity of SSX2
p103-specific T cells from DNA or peptide-immunized mice
was observed for the corresponding p103-111 peptide from
SSX3/5/9, whereas SSX1 p103-111–specific T cells recognized

p103 from SSX6/8, SSX4, and SSX7. Interestingly, whereas SSX
antibodies were unable to fully distinguish between family
members, our T-cell cross-reactivity results show that subtle
differences in amino acids in the TCR-interacting portion of
the epitopes conferred specificity for some members and
cross-reactivity to others. These studies do not rule out the
possibility that other SSX epitopes could be recognized among
family members. Future work with T-cell–directed therapies
needs to consider whether SSX1, 2, and 5, as the most
expressed SSX family members, will specifically be targeted
for prostate cancer. Immune targeting could potentially be
accomplished by immunizing with multiple plasmids encoding these members, or polytope vaccines could be designed
encoding cross-reactive epitopes that will elicit T cells that
can specifically recognize peptides from all SSX family members relevant to prostate cancer.
Although SSX proteins may be expressed in advanced
prostate tumors, it should also be noted that this expression
may be heterogenous, as has been described for other CTA in
various tumor types. This could potentially allow for antigenloss variants during immune targeting with a vaccine. Antigen
heterogeneity might be overcome with EMA treatment to
upregulate antigen expression in tumor tissue, however, it
should be noted that these EMA might have deleterious effects
on immune function or may upregulate antigen expression in
normal tissues. Future work will need to assess the feasibility
of combining these two treatments simultaneously to optimize tumor immunotherapy.
