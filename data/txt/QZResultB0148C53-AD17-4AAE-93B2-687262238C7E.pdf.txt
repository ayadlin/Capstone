Abstract
Tumor-induced immunosuppression remains one of the major obstacles to many potentially effective cancer
therapies and vaccines. Host interleukin (IL)-23 suppresses the immune response during tumor initiation, growth,
and metastases, and neutralization of IL-23 causes IL-12–dependent antitumor effects. Here, we report that
combining agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to drive IL-12 production and anti–IL-23 mAbs to
counter the tumor promoting effects of IL-23 has greater antitumor activity than either agent alone. This
increased antitumor efﬁcacy was observed in several experimental and spontaneous lung metastases models as
well as in models of de novo carcinogenesis. The combination effects were dependent on host IL-12, perforin, IFNg, natural killer, and/or T cells and independent of host B cells and IFN-ab sensitivity. Interestingly, in the
experimental lung metastases tumor models, we observed that intracellular IL-23 production was speciﬁcally
restricted to MHC-IIhiCD11cþCD11bþ cells. Furthermore, an increase in proportion of these IL-23–producing
cells was detected only in tumor models where IL-23 neutralization was therapeutic. Overall, these data suggest
the clinical potential of using anti-CD40 (push) and anti–IL-23 mAbs (pull) to tip the IL-12/23 balance in
established tumors. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2412–21. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Interleukin (IL)-23 is a member of a small family of proinﬂammatory heterodimeric cytokines that also includes IL-12
(1). Both cytokines share a common p40 subunit that is
covalently linked to a p35 subunit to form IL-12 or to a p19
subunit to form IL-23. IL-23 is required for the terminal
differentiation of Th17 cells, a subset of CD4þ T cells distinct
from classical Th1 and Th2 cells, generated following exposure
to IL-6 and TGF-b1 (2). Th17 cells produce IL-17, a proinﬂammatory cytokine that stimulates the production of proinﬂammatory molecules such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF, NOS-2, and
chemokines resulting in inﬂammation. We and others have

previously demonstrated that IL-23 is a critical cytokine in
tumor initiation, growth, and metastases, and that IL-23 can
inhibit natural killer (NK) cell effector functions (3, 4). Recently,
we reported that a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) to
mouse IL-23p19 alone suppressed early experimental B16F10
melanoma lung metastases and modestly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth. More importantly, the use of anti–IL23p19 mAb in combination with IL-2 or anti-erbB2 mAb
treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited subcutaneous growth of
established mammary carcinoma and suppressed established
experimental and spontaneous lung metastases (5). Overall,
these data suggest that IL-23 is an important immunosuppressive cytokine in developing tumors and metastases and that
targeting IL-23 in combination with other promising immune
targets is a rational and effective means to treat cancer.
A more recent study of tumors in a state of cancer:immune
equilibrium (6, 7) or immune-mediated tumor dormancy,
where minimal residual disease exists, has demonstrated that
IL-12 and IL-23 critically determine the balance between tumor
elimination and tumor escape, respectively (8). The ability of
anti-CD40 to prevent tumors emerging from equilibrium and
the known ability of anti-CD40 to provoke IL-12 production by
antigen-presenting cells (APC; ref. 9), suggest that there may be
some merit in preventing tumor outgrowth by using a combination of anti-CD40 and anti–IL-23p19 mAbs. Therefore,
here we have evaluated the efﬁcacy of an anti-CD40/anti–
IL-23p19 combination in mouse models of minimal residual
cancer, including metastases and tumor initiation. Using these
models, we now show that the anti-CD40 and anti–IL-23p19

mAb combination is superior to either therapy alone and the
effect is NK/T- and IL-12p35 dependent.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Inbred C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), C57BL/6 IL-12p35–deﬁcient
(IL-12p35/), C57BL/6 RAG-1–deﬁcient (RAG-1/), C57BL/6
RAG-2-common g-chain–deﬁcient (RAG-2/x gc/),
C57BL/6 mMT (mMT/), C57BL/6 perforin-deﬁcient (pfp/)
and C57BL/6 Type I IFN-deﬁcient (IFNAR1/), C57BL/6
IL-17A deﬁcient (IL-17A/), and BALB/c WT mice were bred
and maintained at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Peter
Mac; Victoria, Australia) or QIMR Berghofer Medical Research
Institute (QIMR; Queensland, Australia) as described previously
(4, 10). Mice (6- to 14-weeks-old) were used in all experiments.
BALB/c female mice were used for all experiments with the
4T1.2 tumor and all experiments were performed in accordance
with guidelines set out by the Peter Mac and QIMR Animal
Experimental Ethics Committee guidelines.
Tumor models
Experimental metastases tumor models. To examine metastatic tumor growth, WT or gene-targeted mice were inoculated
intravenously (i.v.) with the indicated dose of B16F10 melanoma, MC38 colon adenocarcinoma, or RM-1 prostate carcinoma
cells. Mice were monitored and lungs were harvested at day 14
and metastases quantiﬁed as previously described (11). Some
mice were treated with control Ig (cIg; 2A3 or MAC4) or anti–
IFN-g (H22, kindly provided by Dr. Schreiber; Washington
University, St Louis, MO), anti-CD8 (53.6.7), anti-asialoGM1
(anti-ASGM1; Wako Chemicals; as indicated in the legends) to
neutralize IFN-g or deplete cell subsets as previously described
(4). Anti-AGP3 (cIg, 4D2), anti–IL-23p19 (16E5), and anti–IL-12/
23p40 (C17.8) were all grafted on the same murine immunoglobulin G-1 background and kindly provided by AMGEN as
previously described (4). Agonistic anti-mouse CD40 mAb
(FGK45) was purchased from Bioxcell.
Spontaneous tumor metastases model. 4T1.2 mammary carcinoma cells (2  105) were injected into the mammary fat pad
of BALB/c WT mice. Some mice were treated with anti-AGP3,
cIg, anti–IL-23p19, anti-CD40, or anti–IL-12/23p40 as indicated in the legends.
Carcinogenesis model. Groups of 15 male C57BL/6 WT mice
were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) in the hind ﬂank with 400
mg of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA; Sigma Fine Chemicals) in
0.1 mL of corn oil as previously described (12). Mice were
injected with anti-AGP3, cIg, anti–IL-23p19, or anti-CD40 as
indicated in the legends. Development of ﬁbrosarcomas was
monitored weekly over the course of 250 to 300 days. Tumors >
3 mm in diameter and demonstrating progressive growth were
recorded as positive. Measurements were made with a caliper
square as the product of two perpendicular diameters (cm2)
and individual mice are represented.
Cell preparations and ﬂow cytometry
After euthanizing mice, na€ve or tumor-bearing lungs were
perfused with ice cold PBS via the right ventricle to remove
peripheral blood. The perfused lungs were removed, minced

ﬁnely, and incubated in PBS containing 1.3 mmol/L EDTA for
30 minutes at 37 C. Cell suspension were pelleted and resuspended in RPMI digestion media containing 1 mg/mL collagenase type IV (Worthington), 1 mmol/L MgCl2/CaCl2 for 60
minutes at 37 C. Digested lung tissue was passed through a 70
mmol/L cell strainer and washed with PBS twice before being
resuspended in RPMI-1640 [Gibco supplemented with 2.5
mmol/L HEPES, 5.5  105 mol/L 2-mercaptoetanol, 100 U/mL
penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 5 mmol/L glutamine, 0.1
mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate
(all from Gibco Invitrogen) and 10% FBS]. Single-cell suspensions (5  106 cells/mL) were incubated alone or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence
of GolgiPlug (1 ml/mL; BD Pharmingen), in nontissue cultured
treated plates (Corning). After overnight incubation, cells were
harvested for surface and intracellular cytokine staining. For
surface staining, cells were incubated with the following antibodies (all from eBioscience or BD Biosciences): FITC-antiMHC II (2G9), APC-eF780-anti-CD11b (MI/70), and eF450-antiCD11c (N418) in the presence of 2.4G2 (anti-CD16/32, to block
Fc-receptors) on ice. Intracellular staining (ICS) was performed
using reagents from BD Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Kit (BD Biosciences) and the following antibodies: PE-anti–IL-12p40/p70
(C15.6), PE-isotype control (MOPC-173), and eF660-isotype
control (P3.6.2.1). Mouse anti-mouse IL-23 (clone 16E5) antibody was labeled with Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions and used at 1:50 dilution. CD40 expression was not detected by ﬂow cytometry on B16F10, RM-1, and
4T1.2 tumor cells, nor do they produce IL-23 as assayed by
ELISA (data not shown). Cells were acquired on the BD
FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed using
the software program FCS Express.
Statistical analysis
Signiﬁcant differences in metastases, survival, or proportion
of IL-23þ cells were determined by the Mann–Whitney U test or
log-rank sum test. Values of  , P < 0.05 and  , P < 0.01 were
considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Growth inhibition of MCA-induced ﬁbrosarcomas
following anti–IL-23p19/anti-CD40 combination
therapy
Anti-CD40 mAb therapy prevents MCA-induced ﬁbrosarcomas emerging from equilibrium (8) and induces IL-12 production by APCs (9). Given that IL-23 plays a critical role in
opposing the antitumor effects of IL-12 (8), we wished to
determine whether IL-23 neutralization could further potentiate the antitumor effects of anti-CD40–derived IL-12 in
mouse models of minimal residual tumor. Thus, we ﬁrst
assessed the antitumor efﬁcacy of anti-CD40/anti–IL-23p19
combination therapy using the MCA-induced ﬁbrosarcoma
model, where we have demonstrated that host immunity is a
critical factor in suppressing tumor initiation (13) and progression (12). We tested whether prophylactic treatment of
the combination therapy was efﬁcacious in groups of
MCA-inoculated C57BL/6 WT mice (Fig. 1). Mice treated with

anti–IL-23p19/anti-CD40 mAb combination therapy had signiﬁcantly reduced tumor incidence and delayed tumor onset
compared with cIg-treated groups (Fig. 1A, B, and E). MCAinjected mice that received anti–IL-23p19 or anti-CD40 mAb
therapy alone also displayed delayed tumor onset compared
with cIg-treated groups (Fig. 1B, C, and D) but neither single
therapy was as impressive as the combination therapy at
reducing tumor incidence (Fig. 1E). We also assessed the

mAb therapy in mice with established MCA-induced ﬁbrosarcomas (0.25–0.45 cm2; Fig. 2). Impressively, the combination
therapy was able to strongly inhibit tumor growth compared
with cIg-treated groups and interestingly, some mice displayed
long periods of tumor suppression following treatment, with
one mouse actually being cured (Fig. 2A and B). Treatment of
MCA tumor-bearing mice with either therapy alone also
resulted in good tumor growth suppression but was clearly
not as potent as the combination therapy (Fig. 2C and D).

Combined anti–CD40/IL-23p19 mAb therapy suppresses
established experimental and spontaneous lung
metastases
Experimental B16F10 lung metastasis is a tractable shortterm model of minimal tumor burden, where host NK cells
protect the host. We have previously reported that neutralization of IL-23 using a mouse anti-mouse IL-23p19 mAb in
WT mice injected intravenously with B16F10 melanoma
cells reduced lung metastases in a NK cell-dependent manner compared with similar groups of mice treated with
isotype control mAb. In addition, we demonstrated proofof-principle in this study that anti–IL-23p19 mAb synergized
with immunotherapies (e.g., IL-2) that induced NK cell
activation (5). Considering the ability of IL-12 to activate
NK cells, we therefore combined neutralizing anti–IL-23p19
mAb with agonistic anti-CD40 mAb (Fig. 3). Treatment of
WT mice with established B16F10 experimental lung metastases with anti–IL-23p19 plus CD40 mAbs signiﬁcantly
decreased tumor burden compared with control-treated
groups (Fig. 3A). Treatment of similar groups of tumorbearing mice with anti–IL-23p19 mAb or anti-CD40 mAb
alone also reduced tumor burden, although their effects
were more modest (Fig. 3A). The increased therapeutic effect
of combining anti–IL-23p19 mAb with anti-CD40 mAb was
also observed in WT mice bearing established RM-1 prostate

carcinoma experimental lung metastases (Fig. 3B). As we
previously reported, anti–IL-23p19 mAbs had no impact
against WT mice bearing established MC38 colon adenocarcinoma experimental lung metastases (Fig. 3C; ref. 4).
Furthermore, anti–IL-23p19 did not further enhance the
suppression of metastases mediated by anti-CD40 alone
(Fig. 3C).
Having shown that the anti–IL-23p19 plus anti-CD40 combination mAb therapy suppressed established experimental
lung metastases, we next wanted to determine the therapeutic
efﬁcacy of this combination on 4T1.2 spontaneous mammary
carcinoma metastases following primary tumor resection. This
model mimics a setting of surgery and adjuvant treatment of
residual metastatic disease in humans. The 4T1.2 mammary
carcinoma cell line was injected into the mammary fat pad of
groups of BALB/c mice, and after 28 days, the primary tumors
were resected. The next day, these mice commenced a 3-day
treatment schedule with anti–IL-23p19 plus anti-CD40 mAbs,
which resulted in signiﬁcant survival over similar groups of
mice treated with cIg or mice treated with either therapy alone.
In some experiments, groups of mice with resected tumors
treated with the combined anti–IL-23p19/anti-CD40 mAbs
were additionally treated with anti–IL-12/23p40 mAbs that
neutralized both IL-12 and IL-23 (Fig. 3D). Here, loss of IL-23
could not compensate for the loss of IL-12 because the length of

WT mice, further illustrating the importance of IL-12 in natural
host control of lung metastases. In contrast, type I IFNs (IFN-ab)
were not required for the antitumor efﬁcacy of the combination

independent of IL-12 (14), we did not observe any loss of ability

combination therapy in RAG-2/cg / mice (which lack T
cells, B cells, and NK cells) compared with retained activity in
RAG-1/ mice (lacking T and B cells only). This was further
substantiated in WT tumor-bearing mice that were additionally treated with anti-ASGM1 to deplete NK cells. In contrast,
neutralizing antibodies to CD4 and CD8 demonstrated that
CD4þ and CD8þ T cells played a very minor role and through
the use of mMT/ mice, which lack B cells, we showed that B
cells were not critical for the antimetastatic effect of the
combination therapy (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the cytokine IL-17A
was not required, as the combination therapy was equally
effective in tumor-bearing IL-17A/ or WT mice (Fig. 4C).
Given the importance of NK cells, we next examined whether
key NK cell effector functions contributed to the antimetastatic
effect. Combination therapy was only mildly affected in mice
lacking perforin, whereas those neutralized for IFN-g or lacking
both effector molecules did not respond to the therapy (Fig.
4D). We observed similar requirements for NK cells and IL-12,
but not T cells or type 1 IFN or IL-17A, in mice bearing
established RM-1 lung metastases treated with combination
therapy (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, both NK and
CD8þ cells were required for the full efﬁcacy of the combination therapy in mice bearing spontaneous 4T1.2 lung metastases (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 15). Interestingly, in mice
bearing established subcutaneous B16F10 tumors, the efﬁcacy
of the combination therapy was dependent primarily on T cells,
with a minor requirement for NK cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Thus, we demonstrate that the improved efﬁcacy of the anti–
IL-23p19/CD40 combination therapy requires NK cells and/or
T cells depending upon the model examined. This is consistent
with the ability of IL-12 to activate either of these effector
lymphocyte populations.
Expression of IL-23 in tumor-bearing lungs is speciﬁcally
restricted to MHC-IIhi CD11cþCD11bþ cells
To investigate which cells are producing IL-23, we ﬁrst
performed a comprehensive analysis of in vitro bone marrow-derived APCs and ex vivo puriﬁed immune cell populations stimulated with a range of agonists and measured their
capacity to produce IL-23 by ELISA and intracellular cytokine
staining (Supplementary Figs. S4–S8). IL-23 was detected
within 2 hours after stimulation with LPS or curdlan (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and plateaued between 8 to 24 hours. In
contrast, IL-12p70 was not detected until 8 hours and was
maximal at 24 hours after LPS stimulation (Supplementary Fig.
S4B). We next tested the ability of a range of cell types to secrete
IL-23 following overnight culture with a range of stimuli.
Surprisingly, we found that amongst the in vitro derived
populations examined, only activated granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)–derived bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDC) were capable of producing IL-23
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Next, we conjugated the anti–IL23p19 mAb to the Alexa647 ﬂuorochrome to allow for ICS of
IL-23. The speciﬁcity of the IL-23 ICS was validated using
BMDCs from WT and IL-23p19/ mice (Supplementary Fig.
S6). Similar to our ELISA results (Supplementary Fig. S5), we
detected intracellular IL-23 in stimulated BMDCs (Supplementary Fig. S7). CpG proportionately generated far more single IL-

2418

Cancer Res; 74(9) May 1, 2014

12p40þ cells than LPS, suggesting that different stimuli may
generate quite a different proﬁle of IL-12 versus IL-23 production. To determine whether cells other than BMDCs could
produce IL-23, we next assessed for its presence in ex vivo
derived immune cells. Intracellular IL-23 was detected in LPSstimulated CD11bþF4/80þ peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) and
liver mononuclear cells (MNC), but to lower levels than in
stimulated BMDCs (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). In addition, we conﬁrmed that no IL-23 was produced by na€ve or
stimulated NK cells, B cells, T cells, and NKT cells or by a range
of tumor types (EG7, B16F10, RM-1; data not shown). Overall,
these data suggest that mouse IL-23 production is quite
restricted to speciﬁc immune cell types and is very context/
environment dependent.
Although dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages are thought
to be the source of IL-23 (16), it is currently not clear which
mononuclear phagocyte populations produce IL-23 in the
tumor setting. Given our ability to now detect intracellular
IL-23, we utilized this approach to characterize IL-23–producing cells using the experimental lung metastases tumor models
(Fig. 5). Single-cell lung suspensions from tumor-bearing or
naive lungs were generated and cultured overnight. In some
groups, LPS was used as a stimulus to maximize our ability to
detect intracellular IL-23 given our ﬁndings from above. We
observed that the proportion of LPS-stimulated IL-23–expressing cells was statistically elevated in B16F10 and RM-1 tumorbearing lungs compared with naive lungs (Fig. 5A and B).
Interestingly, in both tumor models, we detected IL-23 in
MHC-IIþCD11cþCD11bþ but not MHC-IIþCD11cþCD11b
cells, although both populations clearly were capable of IL12p40 production, which may be secreted as homodimers or
other heterodimers (Supplementary Fig. S9). In contrast, we
saw no increase in the proportion of IL-23þ–producing cells in
MC-38 tumor-bearing lungs (Fig. 5C). This increase in expression correlated directly with the previously described relative
importance of IL-23 in promoting B16F10 and RM-1, but not
MC38, tumor growth/metastases (Fig. 3C; ref. 4).

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated in four different tumor
models of experimental and spontaneous metastasis or de
novo carcinogenesis, that a combination of anti-CD40 and
anti–IL-23 mAbs had greater antitumor activity than either
agent alone. The combination effects were dependent on host
IL-12, IFN-g, NK, and/or T cells, and independent of host B cells
and IFN-ab sensitivity. IL-23 production was regulated very
speciﬁcally and restricted to MHC-IIhiCD11cþCD11bþ cells in
the tumor. The combination therapy further demonstrates the
value of increasing the IL-12:IL-23 ratio in tumors and the
potential of using anti–IL-23 mAbs to improve the immunostimulatory effects of anti-CD40 mAbs in the current management of some advanced human cancers (17).
It is generally thought that dendritic cell and phagocytic
myeloid cell populations that produce IL-12p70 are also capable of producing IL-23, as measured by their increase in p19
subunit gene expression by real-time PCR or Western blot
analyses (18). However, increased expression of p19 mRNA

may not correlate to the translation of p19 protein and/or
formation of bioactive IL-23 (19). In this study, we performed a
comprehensive analysis of IL-23 expression on a range of in
vitro derived APCs and ex vivo puriﬁed immune cell populations stimulated with a range of agonists to determine their
capacity to produce IL-23. Intriguingly, GM-BMDCs, but not
Flt3L-cultured BMDCs or M-CSF–cultured bone marrow
macrophages were capable of producing IL-23 following stimulation. Our studies conﬁrm a previous study by Waibler and
colleagues, who had reported that GM-BMDCs stimulated with
LPS produced IL-23, but not Flt3L-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC; ref. 19) as measured by Western blot analyses
and ELISA. Interestingly, this study also reported that p19
mRNA was expressed constitutively in GM-BMDCs and pDCs
irrespective of whether the cells were activated or not, suggest-

ing the obvious caveat of using an increase in mRNA gene
expression as a readout for functional protein production.
Given that GM-BMDC are considered representative of
dendritic cells that emerge after inﬂammation in vivo (20), we
also examined the capacity of CD11cþ and CD11bþ cells
isolated ex vivo from lymphoid organs, liver, or the peritoneal
cavity to produce IL-23. Intracellular IL-23 was detected in
LPS-stimulated PECs or liver MNCs isolated from WT mice,
but not from stimulated ex vivo puriﬁed CD11cþ or CD11bþ
cells isolated from lymphoid organs. Although we saw no IL-23
from stimulated splenic CD11cþ cells in our experiments
either by ELISA or ICS, one study reported detection of
IL-23 from these cells stimulated with CpG, anti-CD40 mAb,
and GM-CSF, but not LPS. Notably however, the levels of
IL-23 measured were very low (10–60 pg/mL; ref. 21). Recently

von Scheidt et al.

Qian and colleagues reported increased IL-23 production in
splenic-derived CD11cþ cells after stimulation with tumorderived conditioned media and LPS (22). The authors further
showed that tumor-derived prostaglandin E2 was the factor
responsible for upregulating IL-23p19 mRNA expression. In
this study, we demonstrated for the ﬁrst time, detection of
intracellular IL-23 in tumor-bearing lungs. Importantly, we
observed signiﬁcant increase in the proportions of IL-23þ cells
only from B16F10 and RM-1 tumor-bearing lungs, but not
lungs harboring MC38 tumors. Although a basal level of
intracellular IL-23 was detected across all three experimental
lung tumor models, the increase in IL-23þ cells in B16F10 and
RM-1 suggests that these tumors induce a tumor microenvironment that expands IL-23þ cells. It may be interesting to
assess if any differences exist in cell inﬁltrates, growth factors, and cytokines between B16F10/RM-1 and MC38 tumorbearing lungs. Strikingly, IL-23 was detected in MHCIIhiCD11cþCD11bþ cells, but not in other populations, such
as MHC-IIhiCD11cþCD11b cells. In nonlymphoid tissues
such as the lung, it has been suggested that cells costaining
for the above markers may be quite different in both
origin and function to cells from lymphoid tissues (23).
Indeed, Schlitzer and colleagues recently reported that
MHC-IIhiCD11cþCD11bþ cells in lungs consisted of equal
proportion of CD24þCD64 dendritic cells and CD24CD64þ
macrophages. Furthermore, they showed that lung CD11bþ
dendritic cells, but not lung CD11bþ macrophages, were
required for the induction of a Th17 response to fungal
infection. Studies are currently under way to determine
whether the IL-23þ cells in our study are lung CD11bþ
dendritic cells or macrophages.
Preclinically, anti-CD40 mAb has been combined with
many other approaches, including surgery, chemotherapy,
cytokines (IL-2 or IL-15), Toll-like receptor stimulation,
anti–CTLA-4, anti-CD137, and adoptive T-cell therapy
(reviewed in ref. 24). Of these combination approaches with
agonistic anti-CD40 mAb, clinical trials have focused on
various chemotherapies (e.g., gemcitabine, cisplatin and
pemetrexed, paclitaxel, and carboplatin). Early clinical trials
of agonistic CD40 mAb have shown highly promising results
in the absence of disabling toxicity, both in single-agent
studies and in combination with chemotherapy (25). These
ﬁndings suggest that CD40 agonists can mediate both
T-cell–dependent and T-cell–independent immune mechanisms of tumor regression in mice and patients. Although
dendritic cells have been identiﬁed as key player in anti–
CD40-driven tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses in mice, the
role of dendritic cell in human response to agonistic antiCD40 is not clear. Although the primary mechanistic rationale invoked for agonistic anti-CD40 mAb is to activate the
host APC, particularly dendritic cells, to induce antitumor Tcell responses in patients, macrophage-dependent triggering
of tumor regression may also be important (17, 26). Recent
insights into the mechanism of action also implicate Fc:FcgR
interactions as key (25).
Our study with the anti-CD40/anti–IL-23p19 combination
suggests a mechanism of action that is IL-12 dependent and
capable of promoting both NK cell and T-cell antitumor

2420

Cancer Res; 74(9) May 1, 2014

activities likely as a result of anti-CD40 agonizing IL-12 production from APC. Given the specialized conditions of IL-23
production in tumors, it is likely that the combination of antiCD40 and anti–IL-23 serves to drive IL-12p70 production and
neutralize IL-23, thus promoting effector lymphocyte activity
in the tumors. The responding lymphocyte (NK cell or T cell)
depends upon the model examined. Despite the critical importance of host IFN-g, we detected equivalent NK cell IFN-g in the
lungs of mice bearing established B16F10 lung metastases,
after treatment with anti-CD40 or the combination therapy
(data not shown). This suggested that the mechanism by which
IL-23 neutralization enhances anti-CD40 mAb is not by
increasing NK cell IFN-g production. Clearly, when anti–IL23p19 was not effective alone (e.g., MC38 metastases), there
was no beneﬁt in combination with anti-CD40 mAb. How IL-23
neutralization promotes even greater effector cell function
remains elusive.
A study by Uhlig and colleagues (15) suggested that
targeting IL-23 may be effective for the treatment of
tissue-restricted inﬂammatory conditions such as inﬂammatory bowel disease, while maintaining the ability to
mount protective immune responses. Macrophage effector
responses may be potentially limited by blockade of
IL-23 because IL-23 has been previously shown to synergize
with anti-CD40 to induce TNF, IL-1-b, and IFN-g production by macrophages (27), but here in our models, NK
cells and T cells seem to be the major effectors of antitumor immunity. This consideration may have to be made in
translation of the anti-CD40/anti–IL-23 combination into
humans where macrophages seem critical effectors of antiCD40 mAb (16). Although we have not assessed autoimmunity and other immune pathology directly in tumorburdened mice receiving anti-CD40 and anti–IL-23, we
believe this will be a very important and interesting future
study to undertake.
As an alternative strategy to anti-CD40 mAb, the possibility of promoting the NKT cell:DC axis using agonist NKT
cell ligands (28) may also combine well with IL-23 neutralization. Future experiments will consider the comparative
effectiveness of local administration of NKT cell ligands and
anti–IL-23 mAbs, and the scheduling of these treatments to
achieve optimal combination activity. Anti–IL-23 mAbs are
being tested in clinical trials in the context of autoimmune
and inﬂammatory conditions such as psoriasis and inﬂammatory bowel disease. An established safety proﬁle there
will allow exploration of this therapy in the context of
cancer.
