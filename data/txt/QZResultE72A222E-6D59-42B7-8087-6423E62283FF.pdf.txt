Abstract
The underlying mechanism regulating the expression of the
cancer stem cell/tumor-initiating cell marker CD133/prominin-1 in cancer cells remains largely unclear, although
knowledge of this mechanism would likely provide important
biological information regarding cancer stem cells. Here, we
found that the inhibition of mTOR signaling up-regulated
CD133 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in a
CD133-overexpressing cancer cell line. This effect was canceled by a rapamycin-competitor, tacrolimus, and was not
modified by conventional cytotoxic drugs. We hypothesized
that hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF-1A), a downstream
molecule in the mTOR signaling pathway, might regulate
CD133 expression; we therefore investigated the relation
between CD133 and HIF-1A. Hypoxic conditions up-regulated
HIF-1A expression and inversely down-regulated CD133
expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Similarly,
the HIF-1A activator deferoxamine mesylate dose-dependently
down-regulated CD133 expression, consistent with the effects
of hypoxic conditions. Finally, the correlations between CD133
and the expressions of HIF-1A and HIF-1B were examined
using clinical gastric cancer samples. A strong inverse
correlation (r = 0.68) was observed between CD133 and
HIF-1A, but not between CD133 and HIF-1B. In conclusion,
these results indicate that HIF-1A down-regulates CD133
expression and suggest that mTOR signaling is involved in the
expression of CD133 in cancer cells. Our findings provide a
novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms of CD133
expression via mTOR signaling and HIF-1A in cancer cells
and might lead to insights into the involvement of the mTOR
signal and oxygen-sensitive intracellular pathways in the
maintenance of stemness in cancer stem cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The CD133/prominin-1 protein is a five-transmembrane molecule expressed on the cell surface that is widely regarded as a stem
cell marker. Growing evidence indicates that CD133 can be used as
a cell marker for cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells in colon

cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, neural tumors, and renal cancer (1). Strict regulatory
mechanisms governing CD133 expression are thought to be deeply
related to inherent cancer stemness; however, such mechanisms
remain largely unclear, especially in cancer cells. In brain tumors,
the Hedgehog (2), bone morphogenetic protein (3), and Notch (4)
signaling pathways have been implicated in the control of CD133+
cancer stem cell function.
Some investigators have shown a relation between hypoxia and
CD133 expression in brain tissue. The percentage of CD133expressing cells was found to increase in a glioma cell line cultured
under hypoxic conditions (5), and mouse fetal cortical precursors
cultured under normoxic conditions exhibited a reduction in
CD133(hi)CD24(lo) multipotent precursors and the failure of
the remaining CD133(hi)CD24(lo) cells to generate glia (6). With
the exception of these studies in brain tissue, however, data on the
expression of CD133 and the involvement of hypoxia and other
signaling pathways in cancer cells remains limited.
Several reports have indicated that mTOR is a positive regulator
of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) expression and activity (7), and
the inhibition of HIF-mediated gene expression is considered to be
related to the antitumor activity of mTOR inhibitors in renal cell
carcinoma (8). We found that mTOR signaling was involved in
CD133 expression in gastric and colorectal cancer cells. Thus, we
investigated the regulatory mechanism of CD133 in cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. 5-Fluorouracil, irinotecan (CPT-11), and rapamycin were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Gemcitabine was provided by Eli Lilly.
Tacrolimus (LKT Laboratories), LY294002 and wortmannin (Cell Signaling
Technology), and deferoxamine mesylate (DFO; Sigma-Aldrich) were
purchased from the indicated companies.
Cell cultures and hypoxic conditions. All of the 28 cell lines used in
this study were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), except for LoVo
(F12; Nissui Pharmaceutical), WiDr, IM95, and HEK293 (DMEM; Nissui
Pharmaceutical), and Huvec (Humedia; Kurabo). Hypoxic conditions (0.1%
O2) were achieved using the AnaeroPouch-Anaero (Mitsubishi Gas
Chemical) with monitoring using an oxygen indicator.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The methods were previously
described (9). The primers used for the real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) were as follows: CD133, forward 5¶-AGT GGC ATC GTG CAA ACC
TG-3¶ and reverse 5¶-CTC CGA ATC CAT TCG ACG ATA GTA-3¶;
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD), forward 5¶-GCA CCG
TCA AGG CTG AGA AC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-ATG GTG GTG AAG ACG CCA
GT-3¶. GAPD was used to normalize the expression levels in the subsequent
quantitative analyses.
Clinical samples. The mRNA expression levels of CD133, HIF-1a, and
HIF-1h in gastric cancer specimens were obtained from previously
published microarray data (9).

lines using real-time RT-PCR. Several gastric, colorectal, and lung
cancer cell lines such as SNU16, IM95, HSC43, WiDr, and H69,
overexpressed CD133 (Fig. 1A). The increased expression of CD133
protein was also confirmed in these cell lines (Fig. 1B). The mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin, but not cytotoxic drugs (5-fluorouracil, CPT11, and gemcitabine), increased the expression of CD133 in a dosedependent manner in CD133-overexpressing WiDr cells (Fig. 1C
and D). These results indicate that mTOR signaling is involved in
the expression of CD133 in cancer cells.
Rapamycin down-regulated HIF-1A expression and upregulated CD133 expression at the transcriptional level. To
examine the signal transduction of rapamycin-induced CD133
expression, we used the rapamycin-competitor tacrolimus and the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin.
Tacrolimus (10 Amol/L) completely canceled the up-regulation of
CD133 induced by rapamycin. The inhibition of phosphoinositide3-kinase by LY294002 (10 Amol/L) and wortmannin (10 Amol/L)
also up-regulated CD133 expression (Fig. 2A). Rapamycin upregulated CD133 expression at the transcriptional level in a dosedependent and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B).
The inhibition of mTOR signaling is likely to lead to the downregulation of the expression of certain molecules because the
mTOR complex positively regulates the general translational
machinery. Under the inhibition of mTOR signaling, HIF-1a,
among several downstream molecules of mTOR, can activate
transcription by acting as a repressor of specific transcription
factors such as the MYC-associated protein X homodimer (11).
Therefore, we focused on the possible role of HIF-1a in the
regulation of CD133 expression. Rapamycin down-regulated HIF1a expression but up-regulated CD133 expression (Fig. 2C).
Meanwhile, tacrolimus canceled the effect of rapamycin on the

expressions of HIF-1a and CD133 (Fig. 2D). These results suggest
that the down-regulation of HIF-1a may mediate the up-regulation
of CD133 expression in cancer cells. Up-regulation of CD133
expression by rapamycin was reproducibly observed in the CD133
high-expressing cell lines, but not in CD133 low-expressing cell
lines (Supplemental Fig. S2).
Induction of HIF-1A down-regulates CD133 expression in
cancer cells. Hypoxia mediates the stabilization of HIF-1a protein
and enables its escape from rapid degradation, facilitating the upregulation of HIF-1a expression (12). Hypoxia strongly induced
HIF-1a expression, whereas CD133 expression was down-regulated
in all three CD133-overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 3A). Rapamycin
dose-dependently up-regulated CD133 expression under normoxic
conditions, but no effect was seen under hypoxic conditions. We
speculated that the effect of hypoxia on the induction of HIF-1a is
much higher than the effect of rapamycin on the down-regulation
of HIF-1a. The expression of CD133 mRNA was also strongly downregulated under hypoxic conditions in all three cell lines (Fig. 3B)
and in three additional cell lines (Supplemental Fig. S1).
In addition, DFO, a known HIF-1a activator, induced HIF-1a
expression in a dose-dependent manner but down-regulated the
expression of CD133 at both the mRNA and protein levels in
WiDr cells (Fig. 3C and D), and in three additional cell lines
(Supplemental Fig. S2). These results were consistent with those
obtained under hypoxic conditions. Both hypoxia and DFO
exposure markedly down-regulated CD133 expression, strongly
suggesting that induction of HIF-1a results in the down-regulation
of CD133 expression.
Inverse correlation between CD133 and HIF-1A in clinical
samples. Finally, to address whether CD133 and HIF-1a expression
are inversely correlated in clinical samples of gastric cancer

Figure 3. Induction of HIF-1a down-regulates CD133 expression in cancer cells. A, three gastrointestinal cancer cell lines were exposed to rapamycin under normoxic
or hypoxic conditions for 24 h. Hypoxia induced HIF-1a expression and inversely down-regulated CD133 expression. B, hypoxia strongly down-regulated CD133
expression at the mRNA level. Columns, mean determined using real-time RT-PCR; bars, SD. C, DFO, a known HIF-1a activator, induced HIF-1a expression and
down-regulated CD133 expression in WiDr cells. D, DFO induced these effects at both the mRNA and protein levels. Note that both hypoxia and DFO exposure had
similar effects on HIF-1a induction and CD133 down-regulation. Rel. CD133 mRNA, normalized mRNA expression levels (CD133/GAPD  104); Rapa. , rapamycin.

specimens, we examined the expression of these molecules using
previously published microarray data (9). The expressions of CD133
and HIF-1a were inversely correlated in gastric cancer (r = 0.68;
Fig. 4A), whereas the expressions of CD133 and HIF-1h were not
(r = 0.05; Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with the in vitro
findings in the present study.
Taken together, the present results suggest that an oxygensensitive intracellular pathway involving both HIF-1a and mTOR
signaling may, at least in part, regulate CD133 expression in cancer
cells (shown in the schema in Fig. 4B).

Discussion
Hypoxic conditions promote the proliferation of mammalian ES
cells more efficiently than normoxia and are thought to be required
for the maintenance of full pluripotency. Hematopoietic stem cells
are located in the bone marrow, which is a physiologically hypoxic
environment, and the survival and/or self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells is enhanced in vitro if the cells are cultured under
hypoxic conditions (13). Thus, accumulating data indicates that
oxygen levels influence specific cell fates in several developmental
processes; however, the effect of oxygen levels on cell differentiation is thought to be context-dependent (14). Our data on CD133
expression in response to hypoxia were different from the previous
study shown in glioma (5). The discrepancy might be explained by
(a) a different cellular context in glioma from the others, because
CD133 expressions of all cell lines including the WiDr, IM95,
SNU16, OCUM1, 44As3, and DLD-1 cells were reproducibly downregulated by hypoxic condition (Supplemental Fig. S1; Fig. 3B),
whereas the U251 cells failed to exhibit the down-regulation, and by
(b) the different detection methods in our study (Western blot and
quantitative real-time RT-PCR) from the previous report ( flow
cytometry for CD133-positive cells).
The detailed mechanism responsible for the repressive role of
HIF-1a on CD133 expression is not fully understood; one
possible explanation is raised by MYC, which is also known as
c-Myc. HIF-1a binds to MAX and renders MYC inactive, and
HIF-1 (homodimers of HIF-1a and HIF-1h) activates the expression
of MXI1 (MAX interactor 1), which binds to MAX and thereby
antagonizes MYC function (11). Recent reports have shown that
HIF-1a inhibits MYC activity, which is thought to have implications
for stem cell function (15, 16). Whether MYC directly activates
CD133 transcription remains unclear; our preliminary data indicate
that a MYC-inhibitor suppressed CD133 expression in WiDr cells.4
Because the gene amplification of MYC and MYCN is frequently
observed in many cancers, the relations among MYC, HIF-1a, HIF1h, HIF-2, and CD133 should be investigated in future studies.
In conclusion, we showed that the inhibition of mTOR signaling
up-regulated CD133 expression, whereas HIF-1a induction under
