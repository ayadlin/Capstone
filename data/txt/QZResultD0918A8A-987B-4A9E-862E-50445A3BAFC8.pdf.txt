Abstract
Cancer stem–like cells (CSC) are a cell subpopulation that can
reinitiate tumors, resist chemotherapy, and give rise to metastases.
Metadherin (MTDH) contributes widely to tumor growth, drug
resistance, relapse, and metastasis, but its molecular mechanisms
of action are not well understood. Here, we report that MTDH
drives CSC expansion by promoting the expression of TWIST1, a
transcription factor critical for cancer cell stemness and metastasis.
MTDH activates TWIST1 expression indirectly by facilitating
histone H3 acetylation on the TWIST1 promoter, a process

mediated by the histone acetyltransferase CBP. Mechanistic investigations showed that MTDH interacts with CBP and prevents its
ubiquitin-mediated degradation, licensing its transcriptional activation of TWIST1. In clinical specimens of breast cancer, MTDH
expression correlates positively with TWIST1 expression and CSC
abundance. Overall, our work revealed that MTDH promotes
CSC accumulation and breast tumorigenicity by regulating
TWIST1, deepening the understanding of MTDH function in
cancer. Cancer Res; 75(17); 3672–80. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus rather
than cell surface, thus not likely to directly mediate the interaction
of cancer cell and lung endothelium (7), its function in cancer
metastasis, as well as chemoresistance, was revealed again by an
independent approach combining bioinformatic screening and
experimental validation (5). Since then, rapidly accumulated data
have documented its multifaceted roles to help tumors grow,
evade apoptosis, resist chemo- or radiotherapy, and metastasize
to distant organs (5, 6, 8–11). Gene ampliﬁcation of MTDH is
often observed in breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in metastatic
tumors (5, 12–14). The expression of MTDH is also aberrantly
elevated in a broad range of cancers (5, 15, 16), and correlates with
clinical stage, tumor size, lymph node spread, distant metastasis,
and poor survival (17). However, so far the functional mechanism
of MTDH in cancer is not clear. Although studies have reported the
regulation of a number of genes and pathways by MTDH (9,
18–20), little is known about how MTDH delivers oncogenic
signals to the downstream molecules and performs the pluoripotent functions in cancer.
TWIST1 is a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor that
potently drives the EMT process in development and cancer (21).
Activated TWIST1 upregulates N-cadherin (CDH2), downregulates E-cadherin (CDH1), and leads to morphologic change,
migration, and metastasis of cancer cells. In addition, the acquisition of mesenchymal traits resulted from TWIST1 activation
confers CSC characteristics, including tumorsphere formation,
and in vivo tumor initiation, on cancer cells (22, 23). Transcriptionally, TWIST1 can be regulated by miRNAs and transcription
factors such as HMGA2, KLF17, and STAT3 (24–27). Epigenetic
modiﬁcations, including DNA and histone methylation, also play
roles in the activation of TWIST1 expression (28, 29). However,
the regulation of the histone acetylation status of TWIST1 has not
been reported. In addition, although recently MTDH has been

Tumor cells are highly heterogeneous and cancer stem–like
cells (CSC) arise as the subpopulation that can perpetuate the
growth of malignant cells indeﬁnitely (1). Previous studies demonstrated that breast cancer contains CSCs that are responsible for
tumor initiation, chemoresistance, and metastasis (2, 3). It is of
biologic and clinical importance to elucidate the mechanisms of
CSC maintenance and expansion in breast cancer to identify
effective strategies for cancer treatment.
MTDH (also called AEG1 or LYRIC/3D3) is a single-pass
transmembrane protein with the encoding gene located at chromosome 8q22, a genomic region that is frequently ampliﬁed in
cancers (4, 5). The link of MTDH with cancer was ﬁrst uncovered
by a phage cDNA screening for cancer cell proteins that bound to
lung vasculature (6). Although later studies showed that MTDH

MTDH Activates TWIST1 and Promotes Cancer Cell Stemness

indicated to promote cancer cell EMT (30–33), a direct link of
MTDH to prominent EMT regulators, such as TWIST1, is still
unknown. In this study, we demonstrate a MTDH–TWIST1 signal
axis that drives CSC expansion and tumorigenesis of cancer cells.
Mechanistically, the interaction between MTDH and the histone
acetyltransferase CBP prevents CBP from degradation, thus facilitating the epigenetic activation of TWIST1 and CSC expansion in
breast cancer as well as prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and reagents
For MTDH knockdown, the sense and antisense shRNA
oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the BglII and
HindIII site of pSUPER.retro.puro (OligoEngine) as previously
described (5). The same method was used for TWIST1 and CBP
knockdown. For MTDH overexpression, the human MTDH
gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector with BamHI and
EcoRI digestion. For TWIST1 promoter reporter assays, a 2.3-Kb
DNA fragment upstream of TWIST1 transcription start site was
cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega) with EcoRI and HindIII
digestion. All of these constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing. The sequences of primers and shRNA constructs were
available in Supplementary Table S1. The mouse anti-human
MTDH (Abnova H00092140-B01P), the mouse anti-human
MTDH (Cell Signaling Technology 9596s), the rabbit antihuman CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-369), the rabbit
anti-human CD24 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-11406), the
rat anti-human CD44 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-18849),
the mouse anti-human TWIST1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
sc-814417) antibodies, the rabbit anti-human p300 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology sc-584), and DAPI (Roche 10236276001)
were used in this study for Western blot analysis or immunoﬂuorescence analyses. The rabbit anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody (Upstate 06-599) was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. C646 (Selleckchem S7152, 25 mmol/L
for 24 hours), cycloheximide (Beyotime s1560, 25 mg/mL for
4–24 hours), and MG-132 (Beyotime s1748, 100 mmol/L for
12 hours) were used to inhibit CBP, protein translation, and
proteasome activity, respectively. The reagents used to inhibit
DNA methylation and histone deacetylation were 5-Aza-2deoxycytidine (2.5 or 5 mmol/L, 48–72 hours) and Trichostain
A (300 or 600 nmol/L, 12–24 hours).
Tumorsphere culture
Cells were cultured as tumorspheres in DMEM containing
20 ng/mL rhEGF (R&D Systems), 10 ng/mL rhbFGF (R&D Systems), 4 mg/mL heparin sulfate (Sigma), B27 supplement, and 1%
penicillin G-streptomycin. Five thousand cells were seeded in
each well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate. After 2 weeks of
culture, spheres with diameters larger than 50 mm were counted.
When tumorspheres were passaged, sphere pellets were centrifuged and digested with trypsin-EDTA, and 5,000 cells were
reseeded in a new plate.
FACS analyses
FACS analyses were performed using a MoFlo Astrios Flow
Cytometer (Beckman). Nonviable cells were excluded from
further analyses. The ALDEFLUOR Kit (Stem Cell Technologies)
was used to analyze ALDH-positive subpopulation. The speciﬁc
ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) was used
to assess the background signal. For side population analyses,

one million cells were incubated with 5 mg/mL Hoechst 33342
(Sigma) for 90 minutes at 37 C. Control samples were treated
with 50 mmol/L verapamil (Sigma) to block the efﬂux of
the dye.
Chemoresistance clonogenic assay
For chemoresistance analysis, 2  104 cancer cells were seeded
in each well of a 48-well plate. Two days later when the culture
grew to approximately 80% conﬂuence, the cells were treated with
25 nmol/L paclitaxel for 24 hours, and reseeded to a 10-cm dish at
various dilutions. Two weeks later, the colonies were counted with
crystal violet staining.
Luciferase reporter assay
293T cells were cotransfected with the control or MTDH overexpression/knockdown plasmids, the indicated ﬁreﬂy luciferase
reporter plasmid and a Renilla luciferase plasmid with a ratio of
2:2:1. Lysates were collected at 48 hours after transfection, followed by analyses of ﬁreﬂy and Renilla luciferase activities with a
Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega).
RNA stability assay
Cancer cells of 80% conﬂuence were treated with 5 mg/mL
actinomycin D (Dalian Meilun Biology), and mRNA was collected
at the indicated time and analyzed with real-time PCR.
Microarray hybridization and data analysis
Total RNAs of MCF7 with or without MTDH overexpression
were subjected to hybridization to Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0
arrays, performed by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation. The
microarray data were normalized according to the median
intensity of each sample. The genes with expression ratios
between the overexpression and control cells greater than 4
were deﬁned as gene candidates regulated by MTDH. The
microarray data were available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE67249).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
For ChIP assays, cell lysates were cross-linked with 1%
formaldehyde, and 125 mmol/L glycine was used to quench
the formaldehyde. The nuclear extracts were sonicated and
incubated with control IgG or anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody
for immunoprecipitation. The precipitated complexes were
eluted and reverse cross-linked. The captured genomic DNA
was puriﬁed with the silica membrane puriﬁcation kit (TIANGEN) and was used for PCR analyses. One percent of total
genomic DNA from nuclear extracts was used as input.
Animal studies
All animal experiments were performed according to the
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were
approved by the institutional biomedical research ethics committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (Shanghai,
China). NOD/SCID or Balb/c nude mice at the age of 4 to 6
weeks were used in all studies. Orthotopic injection was
performed to study primary tumor growth as previously
described (11). Starting from one week before cancer cells
injection, the mice were treated with subcutaneous injection
of estradiol cypionate (5 mg/kg in 100 mL sesame oil, Dalian

Results

Clinical analyses
Frozen and parafﬁn-embedded breast tumor specimens were
obtained from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Ji'nan,
China) with informed patient consent and approval from the
Institutional Review Board. Frozen tissues were used for RNA
extraction, followed by qPCR analyses of MTDH and TWIST1
expression levels. For Cox survival analysis, the patients were
classiﬁed according to MTDH median expression level.
For immunoﬂuorescence analysis, parafﬁn-embedded specimens were ﬁrst deparafﬁnized. Then the antigen was unmasked
with 10 mmol/L sodium citrate at a sub-boiling temperature for
10 minutes. After blocking, the specimens were incubated with
a primary antibody of CD44, CD24, or MTDH overnight at 4 C.
The samples were washed with PBS for three times and then a
ﬂuorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated
with samples. After washing, the samples were mounted with
coverslips and the immunoﬂuorescence signal was collected
with confocal microscopy. We distinguished the tumor epithelial and stromal cells with H/E staining. For statistic analyses,
ten random viewﬁelds of each sample were assessed for ﬂuorescence intensities with the ZEN blue edition software. Each
sample was scored as low and high according to MTDH staining
intensities and CD44þCD24 cells were counted in the tumor
region.

MTDH knockdown inhibits CSC expansion and tumorigenicity
of breast cancer cells
To study the functional role of MTDH in CSCs of breast cancer,
MTDH was knocked down by two different shRNA in LM2
(Fig. 1A), a lung-metastatic subline derived from MDA-MB-231
cells (34), and the in vitro stemness of the cells were assessed. As
showed in Fig. 1B, MTDH knockdown signiﬁcantly inhibited
tumorsphere formation of cancer cells. Through FACS analyses,
we also found that the ALDH-positive CSC subpopulation was
signiﬁcantly reduced in the knockdown cells (Fig. 1C and D).
To examine the effects of MTDH knockdown on tumorigenicity, we performed serial transplantations of limiting dilutions of
the cells into the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice and
assessed the tumor growth. Interestingly, when 10,000 cells were
injected, no difference in tumor growth was observed between the
control and MTDH knockdown groups. However, tumor inhibition by MTDH knockdown was revealed with 1,000 or 200 cells
injected (Fig. 1E). We further analyzed the difference in tumor
incidence and growth by injecting only 40 cells. MTDH knockdown signiﬁcantly delayed the appearance of tumors (Fig. 1F). At
the sixth week, 5 of 6 injected mice developed tumors in the
control group, whereas only one tumor formed in the 12 mice
injected with the MTDH knockdown cells (Fig. 1G). The tumor
sizes were also signiﬁcantly reduced in the knockdown groups
when some tumors eventually appeared after 8 weeks (Fig. 1E and
H). Hence, MTDH inhibition signiﬁcantly impaired CSC expansion and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells.

Statistical analyses
Unless stated otherwise, data are presented as mean  SD in the
ﬁgures. A Student t test was performed to compare the in vitro data.
A log-rank test was performed to compare tumor-free survival.
P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

MTDH overexpression promotes CSC properties of breast and
prostate cancer cells
Next, we analyzed the function of MTDH by overexpressing it in
MCF7 cells (Fig. 2A). Compared with the cells expressing the

empty vector, the overexpression cells formed more and larger
tumorspheres (Fig. 2B). This enhancement was stable for at least
three passages of the spheres (Fig. 2C). By Hoechest efﬂux analysis, we found that MTDH overexpression expanded the side
population of the cells for more than two folds (Fig. 2D and
E). The CD44þCD24 population was also upregulated by
MTDH (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In addition, ectopic expression
of MTDH correlated with increased expression of ABC transporter
genes, including ABCB1 and ABCG2 (Supplementary Fig. S1B),
and enhanced cell resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as
paclitaxel, which are also hallmark properties of CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
To assess the in vivo tumorigenicity of the cells, we implanted
1  106 MCF7 cancer cells into the mammary fat pads of nude
mice with estrogen supplements, and found that MTDH overexpression signiﬁcantly promoted the tumor incidence. By week
6, all mice with MTDH overexpression cells developed palpable
tumors, whereas only 1 out of 10 mice formed a tumor in the
control group (Fig. 2F). When we repeated the experiments by
injecting 5  105 cancer cells and waited for 6 months to observe
the tumor formation, MTDH overexpression still markedly
increased tumor incidence and tumor sizes (Fig. 2G). Therefore,
MTDH is indispensable and sufﬁcient to promote CSC propagation and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells.
We also found obvious changes in the expression of EMT
marker proteins, including CDH1 and CDH2, following MTDH
overexpression and knockdown in MCF7 and LM2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2), an observation consistent to previous reports on
the role of MTDH in EMT (30–33).
To substantiate the functional study of MTDH in CSCs, we
silenced the expression of MTDH in DU145 prostate cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3A) and found that the CD44þCD24

www.aacrjournals.org

population was signiﬁcantly reduced in the knockdown cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3B), together with the inhibition of ABC
transporter genes (Supplementary Fig. S1B), resistance to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S1C), as well as cancer
cell EMT (Supplementary Fig. S2). We also tested the in vivo
tumorigenicity of DU145 cells by transplanting the cells subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice. Similar to the observations of
LM2 cells, there was no difference in tumor growth between the
control and MTDH knockdown groups when 1  106 cells were
injected (Supplementary Fig. S3C). However, when fewer cells,
including 1  105, 1  104, 2  103, 4  102 cells, were injected,
MTDH knockdown signiﬁcantly reduced tumorigenicity and suppressed tumor growth compared with the control group (Supplementary Fig. S3C–S3E). Overall, these data demonstrated that
MTDH was a pivotal factor for CSC regulation.
TWIST1 mediates the role of MTDH in CSCs
Given the fundamental role of MTDH in CSCs, we searched for
the downstream genes mediating its function by performing a
microarray analysis of MCF7 cells with or without MTDH overexpression (Fig. 3A). The microarray data showed that TWIST1
ranked at the top of the candidate genes regulated by MTDH,
which was conﬁrmed in the mRNA and protein levels by qPCR
and Western blot analyses in MCF7 (Fig. 3B). We also found that
MTDH knockdown led to the downregulation of TWIST1 in LM2
(Fig. 3B). Because TWIST1 is an important factor to promote EMT
and CSC in breast cancer (22, 34–36), we examined whether
TWIST1 mediated the function of MTDH in driving CSC expansion and tumorigenicity. We stably silenced TWIST1 in the
MTDH-overexpressing MCF7 cells (Fig. 3C). TWIST1 knockdown
signiﬁcantly impaired side population abundance, tumorsphere
formation, and in vivo tumorigenicity that were enhanced by

MTDH overexpression. Notably, the cells with both MTDH overexpression and TWIST1 inhibition displayed a tumor-initiating
ability that was comparable with that of the control cells without
MTDH overexpression (Fig. 3D and E).
We further overexpressed TWIST1 in LM2 with or without
MTDH knockdown (Fig. 3C), and found that TWIST1 rescued
the tumor-suppressing phenotypes of MTDH knockdown. More
importantly, MTDH knockdown led to no obvious difference in
tumor incidence or animal survival when TWIST1 was constitutively expressed in the cancer cells (Fig. 3F and G). Therefore,
TWIST1 acts downstream of MTDH to regulate CSC expansion
and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells.
MTDH activates TWIST1 expression by upregulating histone
acetylation
Next, we examined how TWIST1 was regulated by MTDH.
Because the mRNA level of TWIST1 was extensively regulated
by MTDH, we cloned the promoter of TWIST1 and performed
luciferase reporter assays in 293T cells. The results showed that
MTDH knockdown or overexpression failed to signiﬁcantly
affect the reporter activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that MTDH
cannot directly regulate the promoter activity of TWIST1. Next,
we analyzed the mRNA stability of TWIST1 in breast cancer cell
lines. Following actinomycin D treatment to inhibit de novo
transcription, the mRNA level of TWIST1 declined within
hours. However, MTDH knockdown or overexpression led to
no signiﬁcant changes in the speed of TWIST1 mRNA degradation (Fig. 4B). Therefore, MTDH was not likely to stabilize
TWIST1 mRNA.
Then we analyzed whether epigenetic regulation was involved
in TWIST1 activation by MTDH. We treated MCF7 cells with
MTDH overexpression and control cells using the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) and the DNA
methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (Aza). The data

showed that each of the chemicals was able to activate the
expression of TWIST1 in the control cells, and the upregulation
was more obvious when both chemicals were used together.
However, in the MTDH-expressing cells, TSA was less potent for
TWIST1 induction than Aza (Fig. 4C). Further analyses demonstrated that when histone deacetylation was inhibited by TSA, the
expression of TWIST1 was almost the same in control and MTDHexpressing cells (Fig. 4D). In contrast, Aza was not able to
diminish the upregulation of TWIST1 by MTDH. The differential
effects of these two inhibitors on TWIST1 expression was not
related to the treatment duration or doses, as shown by repeating
the experiments with different time courses and compound concentrations of the inhibitor treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and S4B). These data suggested that TWIST1 activation by MTDH
might be due to regulation of histone acetylation. To verify this,
we performed a ChIP assay to analyze the histone acetylation
status around TWIST1 promoter and found that MTDH overexpression indeed enhanced acetylation of histone H3 on TWIST1
promoter (Fig. 4E). Moreover, the overall level of H3 acetylation
was also increased after MTDH overexpression, as revealed by
Western blotting (Fig. 4F). Notably, there was no obvious binding
of acetylated histone on the TWIST1 reporter promoter ectopically
introduced into the cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C), providing an
explanation why the reporter construct was not responsive to
MTDH overexpression or knockdown (Fig. 4A).
MTDH interacts with CBP to prevent ubiquitin-mediated CBP
degradation
Because MTDH regulated histone H3 acetylation on the promoter of TWIST1, we further searched for the executor of histone
acetylation. Previous studies showed that MTDH was able to
interact with the histone acetyltransferase CBP (9). In addition,
CBP and its homolog p300 were connected to TWIST1 expression
(37, 38). Therefore, we tested the possibility that CBP was

involved in MTDH-regulated histone acetylation. First, we
conﬁrmed that MTDH interacted with the CBP protein with
reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays in cancer cells (Fig.
5A). Then we found that CBP transcription was unaffected by
MTDH in MCF7, but its protein level was obviously increased
upon MTDH overexpression (Fig. 5B and C). CBP mRNA
stability analysis showed that MTDH could not protect CBP
transcript from degradation (Fig. 5D). However, when de novo
protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), the
degradation of CBP protein was pronouncedly slower in MTDH
overexpression cells than the control cells (Fig. 5E and F). In
further analyses, we blocked ubiquitin-mediated proteasome
activity by treating cells with MG132 and analyzed the ubiquitination status of CBP. Accordantly, less CBP ubiquitination
was observed when MTDH was overexpressed (Fig. 5G), arguing for the conclusion that MTDH protects the CBP protein
from ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
To further verify that CBP was responsible for MTDH regulation
of TWIST1 expression and CSC properties, we used a p300/CBPspeciﬁc inhibitor C646 to treat MCF7 and found that CBP inhibition blocked TWIST1 expression and sphere formation that
were induced by MTDH overexpression (Fig. 5H and I). We also
stably silenced CBP with a shRNA construct in MTDH overexpression cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and observed the same
changes (Fig. 5J). In addition, side population analyses in these
cells showed that although MTDH increased CSC fraction in
MCF7, CBP silencing reversed the phenotype induced by MTDH
(Fig. 5K). Notably, the CBP homolog p300 was not affected by
MTDH overexpression or CBP shRNA. In addition, inhibition of
p300 with a siRNA construct did not inﬂuence the expression of
TWIST1 (Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). Collectively, these
data demonstrated that CBP, but not p300, acted downstream of

MTDH to regulate TWIST1 expression and CSC population in
cancer cells.
MTDH correlates positively with CSC abundance and TWIST1
expression in breast cancer samples
Next, we studied the clinical signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings. To
investigate the correlation of MTDH with CSC abundance in
human breast tumors, we assessed the expression of MTDH,
CD44, and CD24 in 16 invasive ductal breast carcinomas by
immunoﬂuorescence staining (2). The analysis showed that
higher expression of MTDH was signiﬁcantly linked to increased
presence of CD44þCD24 CSC population in the tumors (Fig. 6A
and B). To unravel the clinical relevance of MTDH and TWIST1
expression, we collected a set of fresh-frozen breast tumors from
Qilu Hospital and assessed the mRNA levels of the two genes.
MTDH expression correlated positively with that of TWIST1 in
these samples (Fig. 6C, Pearson r ¼ 0.38). IHC analysis also
showed that both MTDH and TWIST1 proteins were upregulated
in breast tumor edges as compared with intratumor areas (Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting the enrichment of the molecules
in invasive front of tumors. Moreover, MTDH expression was also
a prognostic factor of distant metastasis in this cohort (Fig. 6D).
Thus, MTDH is clinically linked to TWIST1 expression, CSC
abundance, and prognosis of breast cancer.

Discussion
Accumulated data of functional studies and clinical analyses
have ﬁrmly established MTDH as an important regulator of
neurodegeneration, cancer metastasis, and chemoresistance
(5, 11, 17, 39, 40). However, compared with the unanimous
functional roles of MTDH in these processes, the underlying

mechanisms are far from clear. Indeed, the downstream events of
MTDH remain fragmentary despite previous efforts to explain the
potency of MTDH in cancer regulation. On one hand, although
numerous studies reported that MTDH activated oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/Akt, NF-kB, and Wnt/b-catenin (9, 18–20), it is
unclear how MTDH is involved in these signaling pathways. On
the other hand, recent data demonstrated that the physical interaction of MTDH with the nuclease protein SND1 was critical for
cancer initiation (41–43), the downstream signaling of this interaction is unknown. Here, we reported a different and detailed
pathway that can connect MTDH to the malignant behaviors of
cancer cells. First, we provided evidence of the role of MTDH in
CSC regulation by showing that MTDH elevated the abundance of
ALDH-positive fraction and side population of cancer cell lines,
and correlated with the CD44þCD24 subpopulation in clinical
samples. It also promoted sphere formation, drug resistance as
well as in vivo tumorigenesis of cancer cells. Then we demonstrated
that the regulation of CSC traits by MTDH was dependent on the
downstream molecules CBP and TWIST1. MTDH interacted with
CBP to prevent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the histone
acetyltransferase and enhanced histone H3 acetylation on
TWIST1 promoter, thus leading to the transcriptional activation
of TWIST1 and CSC promotion. Thus our study delineated a
molecular pathway of MTDH in driving cancer progression (Fig.
6E) and will profoundly expand our understanding for this master
regulator of cancer.
Metastasis and chemoresistance are the two most malignant
features of tumor cells that account for disease progression and
eventually therapeutic failure of cancer. As we and many others
have shown the dual roles of MTDH to promote metastasis and
chemoresistance (11, 40), it would be interesting to test whether
MTDH also regulates cancer initiation and recurrence. Previously
Kang and colleagues demonstrated that MTDH promoted tumor
initiation using oncogene-driven breast cancer mouse models

3678 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

(42). Here, we corroborated this conclusion with various CSC
assays in cancer cell lines. In addition, our data uncovered the link
of MTDH with TWIST1, the pivotal transcription factor in CSC
expansion and cancer cell EMT (21, 22). Therefore, these results
suggest that the pluripotency of MTDH in cancer can be explained
by a fundamental role in CSC regulation, and support the rationale of MTDH-targeting strategies to prevent cancer initiation,
recurrence, and metastasis.
The challenge in studying the functional mechanisms of MTDH
is largely due to the lack of homology of MTDH to any known
protein structures. However, among the misty data regarding the
molecular nature of MTDH, the observations that MTDH plays its
roles by protein–protein interactions seem to be increasingly
convincing. In addition to CBP, a number of proteins, such as
CEACAM1, BCCIPa, PLZF, p65, AGO2, and SND1, have been
documented to interact with MTDH, and these interactions are
indispensible for MTDH regulation of cancer cell features
(7, 9, 19, 43–46). Notably, MTDH stabilizes some of these partner
proteins, including BCCIPa and SND1. Here, we not only show
that MTDH prevents the degradation of CBP through physical
interaction, but also demonstrate the involvement of ubiquitinmediated proteasome activity in this process. Therefore, disrupting the interaction of MTDH with its partner proteins may be
useful to target MTDH in cancer therapeutics. However, further
studies are required to illustrate how MTDH selects its interacting
partners and interrupts protein degradation in order to rationalize
such approaches.
Histone modiﬁcations are important epigenetic mechanisms to
regulate a broad range of developmental and disease processes. In
this study, we unravel a new role of MTDH in epigenetic regulation to interact and stabilize the CBP protein. As a core member of
the p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase (HAT) family, CBP regulates gene expression as a transcriptional coactivator by acetylating histones and other transcription factors. CBP has been

widely known to be involved in normal stem cell regulation and
cancer progression (47–49), but its role in CSC is seldom
reported. Our data show that CBP directly regulates the expression
of TWIST1 and promotes CSC traits, thus expanding the role of
CBP in cancer. Our data, together with previous studies (37, 38),
suggested that CBP acted upstream of TWIST1 and its homolog
p300 was a downstream target of TWIST1, highlighting the
connection of the MTDH–TWIST1 axis to histone modiﬁcation.
More importantly, as many histone modiﬁcation inhibitors are
being developed in therapeutics, our ﬁndings that link MTDH to
epigenetic regulation may provide new opportunities to target
CSC and MTDH signaling in metastatic cancer.
