Abstract
Occult metastases are a major cause of cancer mortality, even among patients undergoing curative resection.
Therefore, practical strategies to target the growth and persistence of already established metastases would
provide an important advance in cancer treatment. Here, we assessed the potential of protein therapy using a cell
permeable NM23-H1 metastasis suppressor protein. Hydrophobic transduction domains developed from a screen
of 1,500 signaling peptide sequences enhanced the uptake of the NM23 protein by cultured cells and systemic
delivery to animal tissues. The cell-permeable (CP)-NM23 inhibited metastasis-associated phenotypes in tumor
cell lines, blocked the establishment of lung metastases, and cleared already established pulmonary metastases,
signiﬁcantly prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing animals. Therefore, these results establish the potential use
of cell-permeable metastasis suppressors as adjuvant therapy against disseminated cancers. Cancer Res; 71(23);

Introduction
Metastasis is an acquired and separately evolving phenotype that enables cancer cells to disseminate and grow at
locations distant from the primary tumor site. For many
tumors, the molecular changes responsible for initiating
metastatic spread have already occurred by the time of
initial diagnosis, and are ultimately responsible for most
cancer deaths (1, 2). Effective strategies to target disseminated tumors are therefore expected to have tremendous
therapeutic beneﬁt.
In principle, antimetastasis therapies could either block
activities required for the growth or survival of disseminated
cancer cells or restore the expression and/or activity of
proteins that function to suppress metastasis. The latter
includes more than 20 metastasis suppressors—proteins
that selectively inhibit the seeding, growth, or persistence
of metastatic foci while having only limited effects on

primary tumors (3). NME1, the ﬁrst reported metastasis
suppressor gene, was initially characterized as nucleoside
diphosphate kinase (NDK), an enzyme required to maintain
cellular pools of nucleoside triphosphates. Interest in NDK
as a metastasis suppressor (alternatively named NM23-H1 or
NM23) was prompted by studies describing inverse correlations between NM23 expression and metastatic potential,
ﬁrst in melanoma cells (4) and later in other types of tumors
(5). Subsequent gene transfer experiments documented the
ability of NM23 to suppress metastasis-associated phenotypes both in cultured cells and in animal metastasis models
(6–10). The precise mechanism by which NM23 inﬂuences
metastasis is not understood, in part, because the protein
possesses multiple enzymatic activities that directly or
indirectly suppress mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling (11, 12); regulate small G-protein functions important in cell motility, cytoskeletal reorganization,
and cell adhesion (13–15); and inﬂuence genome maintenance (16, 17). Nevertheless, clinical trials based on hormonal activation of endogenous NM23 expression are currently in progress (4).
In the present study, we describe an antimetastasis therapy
based on the systemic delivery of a cell penetrating NM23-H1
protein. For this experiment, we developed novel macromolecule transduction domains (MTD) modeled after hydrophobic signal peptides previously shown to promote protein
uptake by cultured cells and animal tissues (18). The MTDNM23 inhibited metastasis-associated phenotypes in tumor
cell lines and not only suppressed the establishment of lung
metastases but also cleared previously established metastases,
signiﬁcantly prolonging the survival of animals harboring
disseminated tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of recombinant MTD-fused proteins
MTD-76 and MTD-77 were identiﬁed from a screen of 1,500
signaling peptides for sequences with protein transduction
activity. Sequences spanning amino acids 8 to 30 of NP631283
(FLIAGVIVALLAVFTVVRAVRIV) and 1 to 23 of NP003231
(MWPLWLCWALWVLPLAGPGAALT) were subsequently
modiﬁed (D. Jo et al.; manuscript in preparation), generating
ALVLPLAP and AVALLILAV, respectively. Coding sequences
for NM23 and enhanced GFP (EGFP) fusion proteins were
cloned into pET-28aþ (Novagen) from PCR-ampliﬁed DNA
segments (Supplementary Table S1). The recombinant proteins were puriﬁed from Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus
(DE3) cells grown at an A600 of 0.6 and induced for 2 hours
with 0.7 mmol/L Isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). Denatured 6 histidine-tagged recombinant proteins
were puriﬁed by Ni2þ afﬁnity chromatography as directed
by the supplier (Qiagen). After puriﬁcation, they were
dialyzed against a refolding buffer (0.55 mol/L guanidine HCl,
0.44 mol/L L-arginine, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1
mmol/L EDTA, 100 mmol/L NDSB, 2 mmol/L reduced glutathione, and 0.2 mmol/L oxidized glutathione) and then
against a physiologic buffer such as RPMI-1640 medium.
H, N, and M stand for the His tag, NM23, and MTD, respectively.
Histidine-tagged recombinant NM23 proteins were HN (HisNM23), HM76N (His-MTD76-NM23), HNM76 (His-MTD76NM23), HM77N (His-MTD77-NM23), and HNM77 (His-NM23MTD77).

Analysis of protein uptake in cultured cells
Recombinant proteins were conjugated to 5/6-ﬂuorescein
isothiocynate (FITC), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Chemical). RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 10
mmol/L FITC-labeled proteins for 1 hour at 37 C, washed 3
times with cold PBS, treated with proteinase K (10 mg/mL) for
20 minutes at 37 C to remove cell-surface bound proteins, and
subjected to FACS analysis (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson).
Each experiment was conducted at least 3 times.
Experiments to visualize protein uptake were conducted in
much the same manner except that NIH3T3 cells were exposed
to 10 mmol/L FITC-proteins for 30 minutes and then nuclei
or plasma membranes were counter stained with 1 mg/mL
propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) or 5 mg/mL FM4-64
(Molecular Probes), respectively. The cells were washed 3 times
with cold PBS and examined by confocal laser scanning
microscopy.
Systemic delivery of MTD fusion proteins
Six-week-old Balb/c female mice were injected intraperitoneally (300 mg/head) with FITC only, FITC-conjugated EGFP,
or NM23 recombinant proteins. After 2 hours, the liver, kidney,
spleen, lung, heart, and brain were isolated, infused with O.C.T.
compound (Sakura), and frozen on dry ice. Cryosections
(20-mm thickness) were analyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy.
Alternatively, the uptake of FITC-NM23 proteins was assessed
after 1 and 2 hours by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis of unﬁxed blood leukocytes/lymphocytes or
total splenocytes.

To determine the tissue distribution of cell permeable (CP)NM23 proteins, mice were injected i.v. with diluent, HN, or
MTD-NM23 (600 mg/mouse). The spleen and liver were
removed after 3 hours, embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned at
5 mmol/mL, and immunostained with NM23 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or 6 His tag (Abcam) monoclonal antibodies,
followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (Santa Cruz).
Immunoblot analysis
MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and A549, HCT116 cell lines
were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea)
and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), respectively
and maintained as recommended by the suppliers. The biologic activities of the cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231,
and HCT116) were authenticated by in vivo metastasis and/or
tumor growth in Balb/c nu/nu mice. All cell lines were negative
for mycoplasma assessed by MycoALERT (2009; Lonza). Cells
were treated at 37 C with 10 mmol/L recombinant proteins
(HN, HM76N, HNM76, HM77N, or HNM77) or with buffer only.

MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells were treated with
HN, HM76N, HNM76, HM77N, or HNM77 proteins (10 mmol/L)
or with buffer alone for 1 hour at 37 C. A total of 1  105
cells were added to the top of a trans-well chamber partitioned
with a Matrigel-coated (40 mg per well; BD Biosciences) polycarbonate membrane ﬁlter (BD Falcon) with a pore size of 3
mm. After 24 hours at 37 C, the ﬁlters were washed with PBS
and the noninvasive cells remaining on the surface of the upper
part were removed with a cotton swab. The invasive cells that
passed through the Matrigel and migrated to the lower part of
the ﬁlter were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes,
stained with 0.5% (w/v) hemacolor for 20 minutes, and counted
with an optical microscope. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by the Student t test.

Cell-Permeable Tumor Metastasis Suppressor NM23

CP-NM23 proteins
NM23 proteins containing MTD-76 or MTD-77 fused to
either the N- or C-terminus along with an amino-terminal
6 His tag were expressed in E. coli and puriﬁed by Ni2þ afﬁnity
chromatography (Supplementary Fig. S2A), with yields of
soluble protein ranging from 4 to 15 mg/L. Higher levels of
all MTD-NM23 fusion proteins (HM76N, HNM76, HM77N, and
HNM77) accumulated in RAW cells, as compared with a control
protein (His tagged NM23, HN) without an MTD sequence
(Supplementary Fig. S2B); however, MTD-77 had greater transduction activity, regardless of whether the MTD was positioned on the amino or carboxyl terminal end. Given this
difference, subsequent experiments focused primarily on
MTD-77, which also enhanced the uptake of NM23 by RAW
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and systemic delivery of NM23
to various organs in mice (Supplementary Fig. S3).

respectively). Similar results were obtained in a wound-healing
assay using the same cell lines (Fig. 2B). HM77N, which displayed the greatest uptake and activity suppressing MAPK
signaling and cell migration, was selected as the best candidate
to test for antimetastasis activity.
CP-NM23 suppresses metastasis-associated phenotypes
The metastatic phenotype relies on the ability of tumor cells
to adhere to distal sites, survive, and promote angiogenesis. We
therefore evaluated the impact of HM77N on these aspects of
the metastatic phenotype. First, we examined the adhesion of
cancer cell lines to ﬁbronectin and type 4 collagen, 2 major
components of the extracellular matrix. HM77N signiﬁcantly
inhibited the attachment of MDA-MB-435 (Fig. 3A) and MDAMB-231 (Fig. 3B) cells to ﬁbronectin, and suppressed the
attachment of MDA-MB-435 cells to type IV collagen. MDAMB-231 cells adhered poorly to type 4 collagen, and attachment
was not reduced further by HM77N. HM77N also inhibited
anchorage independent growth of MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig.
3C) and induced signiﬁcant apoptosis as assessed by caspase-3 activity and Annexin V staining (Fig. 3D and E). However, HM77N was not overtly toxic to untransformed (NIH3T3)

and MTD-77 enhanced the systemic delivery of EGFP fusion
proteins to multiple tissues following intraperitoneal injection
(Supplementary Fig. S1C), suggesting that both MTDs were
effective in vitro and in vivo.

CP-NM23 suppresses MAPK signaling and cell migration
The metastasis suppressor NM23 has pleiotropic effects on
MAPK signaling, EDG2 (lysophosphatidic acid receptor)
expression, and cell migration. We, therefore, examined the
effects of CP-NM23 on steady-state MEK and ERK phosphorylation and EDG2 expression in several human tumor cell lines.
Both MTD-76- and MTD-77-NM23 proteins suppressed MEK
and ERK phosphorylation in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells
(Fig. 1A), although MTD-77-NM23 proteins (HM77N and
HNM77) were more potent suppressors, consistent with higher
levels of protein uptake (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The effects
of HM77N were even more striking, with near complete suppression of MEK and ERK phosphorylation and EDG2 expression in MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells (Fig. 1B and C). These
results suggest that MTD-76 and MTD-77 can deliver biologically active NM23 protein into human tumor cells.
We next used a Matrigel invasion assay to assess the effects
of CP-NM23 proteins on cell migration. Tumor cells with high
mobility [MDA-MB-435 (Fig. 2A, left) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.
2A, right)] were treated with recombinant proteins for 1 hour,
and their migration was compared with that of controls treated
with media alone or with NM23 lacking an MTD. HM76N,
HM77N, and HNM77 signiﬁcantly inhibited migration in both
cell lines (by 68% and 56%; 79% and 58%; and 74% and 58%,

cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). To determine the effects of
CP-NM23 on p53-dependent apoptosis and angiogenesis, 3
different human cancer cell lines originating from breast
(MDA-MB-435), colon (HCT116), and lung (A549) cells were
treated with CP-NM23. HM77N positively regulated the phosphorylation of p53 and negatively controlled the expression of
metastasis-speciﬁc markers, EDG2 and VEGF (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Thus, CP-NM23 suppressed multiple aspects of the
metastatic phenotype.
Because metastasis also involves processes extrinsic to
tumor cells, including tissue remodeling and angiogenesis,
HM77N was also tested for antiangiogenic activity (Supplementary Fig. S6). Primary human vascular endothelial cells
treated with buffer alone or control NM23 protein (HN) spontaneously organized into tubes when cultured on a Matrigel
substrate, whereas HM77N effectively blocked tube formation.

CP-NM23 enhances survival of mice with disseminated
metastases
We next tested CP-NM23 for antitumor activity in xenograft metastasis models. MDA-MB-435 cells, a metastatic
human breast-cancer cell line, were injected (5  106) into
the lateral tail veins of 5-week-old, MHC-deﬁcient Balb/c
nu/nu mice, and after 5 weeks, 10 mice each were treated
daily with diluent alone or with 300 mg HN, HM77N, or
HNM77 proteins for 3 weeks (weeks 5–8). Animal survival
was monitored for 24 weeks (Fig. 5A). HM77N and HNM77
proteins both greatly enhanced survival as compared with
that of controls (P < 0.05). Consistent with differences in
survival, mice treated with CP-NM23 proteins contained far
fewer lung metastases at the end of the treatment period at
week 8 (Fig. 5B, top) and 2 weeks later (Fig. 5B, bottom) than
lungs from mice treated with diluent alone or with NM23
protein without a MTD sequence. These macroscopic differences were conﬁrmed by a histologic examination of lung
sections immunostained for vimentin, a marker of tumor
invasiveness (Fig. 5C). Similar or greater survival differences
between HM77N treatment and controls were obtained when
the experiment was extended for 40 weeks (Fig. 6A; P < 0.001)
and when mice were treated twice weekly instead of daily
(Fig. 6B; P < 0.001). As before, lungs from control mice
contained greater numbers of visible vimentin-expressing
metastases at week 8 as compared with HM77N-treated mice
(Fig. 6C and D). Similar results were obtained following tail
vein injection of 5  106 MDA-MB-231 cells in fewer animals
(5 per treatment group, data not shown).

Systemic delivery of CP-NM23
Systemic delivery of CP-NM23 was examined in mice
following i.v. injection of FITC-labeled HM77N. High levels
of FITC-HM77N were observed in peripheral blood leukocytes/lymphocytes, total splenocytes, and liver and spleen
cryosections within 1 hour after injection. The protein persisted for several hours as assessed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 4A),
ﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig. 4B), and immunostaining with
antibodies speciﬁc for either NM23 (Fig. 4C, left) or the Hispeptide tag (Fig. 4C, right). In contrast, the same cells and
tissues failed to accumulate FITC alone or FITC-labeled NM23
protein lacking the MTD-77 sequence (FITC-HN). The halflives of internalized MTD-fused recombinant NM23 proteins in
PBMC and spleen cells were 4.5 and 2.8 hours, respectively (D.

These results show that protein therapy with CP-NM23
signiﬁcantly inhibits the growth and persistence of well-established breast cancer metastases in vivo, resulting in increased

tumor metastases, protein therapy was initiated at the same

injected daily with HM77N exhibited enhanced survival (90%)

Tumor colonies in lung

Metastasis is an important clinical problem responsible for
the vast majority of all cancer deaths, including a high percentage of therapeutic failure following curative resection. For
example, the 5-year recurrence rate for lymph node–negative
colon, lung, and breast/prostate cancers is 30%, 40%, and 10%
to 20%, respectively (2). Adjuvant therapies capable of arresting
or reversing the metastatic process are therefore expected to
have a signiﬁcant impact on cancer mortality. In the present
study, we show the effectiveness of protein-based therapy to
deliver CP-NM23 protein as an antimetastatic agent. The
CP-NM23 inhibited metastasis associated phenotypes in
tumor cell lines and not only suppressed the establishment
of lung metastases but also cleared already established
metastases, greatly prolonging the survival of animals harboring disseminated tumor cells.
Our approach made use of new MTDs designated MTD-76
and MTD-77, which were selected from a screen of 1,500
hydrophobic signaling peptides and subsequently modiﬁed to
eliminate charged and polar amino acids, increase predicted
a-helical content and limit the number of consecutive hydrophobic residues (D. Jo et al., manuscript in preparation). In the
present study, MTD-76 and MTD-77 signiﬁcantly improved (up
to 4-fold) the delivery of recombinant proteins into cultured
cells and tissues as compared with the hydrophobic transduction domain based on the FGF-4 signal peptide. These data
establish MTD-76 and MTD-77 as potential vectors for proteinbased therapeutics.
Our decision to investigate hydrophobic MTDs rather
than use basic protein transduction domains (e.g., HIV tat)
was based on several considerations. First, previous studies
had made only a limited effort to identify hydrophobic
sequences with enhanced protein transduction activity
(18). Second, despite this limitation, the FGF-4 MTD has
been successfully used to deliver biologically active peptides
and proteins systemically in animals including dramatic
protection to lethal proinﬂammatory conditions (20, 22–
24). Finally, the hydrophobic MTDs are thought to enter cells
directly by penetrating the plasma membrane; (18) in contrast, the basic protein transduction domains bind to the cell
surface and bulk entry occurs by endocytosis (25). Although
these distinctions are not absolute and uptake mechanisms
may vary depending on the cargo, we were concerned that
endocytosed proteins that fail to reach the cytosol (26) could

and ERK phosphorylation), EDG2 expression, and enhanced
apoptosis, consistent with the effects of augmented NM23 gene
expression in cultured cells (11, 13–15, 28). In principle, such
activities are expected to suppress multiple early events in the
metastatic process such as invasion, attachment, colonization,
and neovascularization. Indeed, CP-NM23 blocked the seeding
of pulmonary metastases when administered at the time tumor
cells were introduced into the blood stream. Moreover, CPNM23 also targeted already established metastases, in some
cases clearing the lungs of tumors and greatly increasing
survival.
The levels of metastasis suppression achieved by CP-NM23
were comparable with if not greater than those reported after
enforced expression of the NM23 gene in tumor cell lines (6–
10). This suggests that the activity of systemically delivered
MTD-77-NM23 approaches theoretical limits determined by
the biology of the NM23 function in tumor cells. MTD-77-NM23
also outperformed gene therapy (29, 30) and hormonal activation of the endogenous NM23 gene (12). The latter study,
which provided the basis for human trials of medroxyprogesterone acetate, reported 55% fewer lung metastases in treated
mice after 14 weeks, whereas, most mice treated with cellpermeable NM23 remained free of lung metastases even after
20 weeks. Moreover, while medroxyprogestrone-treated mice
maintained weight better (by 18% after 14 weeks), we observed
far more dramatic survival differences after 40 weeks (80%–
100% treated animals survived vs. 0%–25% of mice in the
control groups). These results underscore the ability of
MTD-77 to systemically deliver biologically active proteins
into blood-borne tumor cells and metastases. Moreover, in
addition to targeting tumor cells, the efﬁcacy of CP-NM23 as a
metastasis suppressor may beneﬁt from targeting other cells
and processes required to establish and maintain metastases
in ectopic tissue niches.
Although NM23-H1 was initially characterized as a metastasis suppressor, the protein functions in normal hematopoiesis (31, 32) and plays complex roles in the development of
different malignancies (33). Moreover, NM23-H1 functions are
not always intracellular, judging from activities mediated by
extracellular NM23 (34, 35). In particular, the protein is overexpressed in some tumors, including hematologic malignancies, and is present at elevated levels in patient sera, where the
protein seems to promote tumor cell growth and survival by
autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms (36–39). In the present study, we show that NM23-H1 lacking an MTD sequence
does not efﬁciently enter cells. This underscores the idea that

the biologic effects of externally applied NM23 protein originate from outside the cell and not from internalized protein.
Even so, considering the widespread ability of proteins to enter
cells (40), studies investigating extracellular HM23 should
examine this issue more carefully. Conversely, the antimetastatic function of HM23, which strictly required an MTD
sequence, seems to be mediated by intracellular protein.
However, although the MTD sequence and protein internalization seem necessary, they may not be sufﬁcient for the full
antimetastatic response. Additional experiments will be
required to determine if extracellular NM23, for example acting
on myeloid cells, contributes to the antimetastatic response.
In summary, despite widespread interest in metastasis as a
therapeutic target, most antimetastatic drugs currently in
development focus on tumor cell migration and invasion with
uncertain utility against disseminated disease (41). Our results
describe a potential therapeutic strategy to target occult
metastases that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy.
