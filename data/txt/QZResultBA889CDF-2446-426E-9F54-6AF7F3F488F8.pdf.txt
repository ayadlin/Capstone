Abstract
Shikonin derivatives, which are the active components of the
medicinal plant Lithospermum erythrorhizon, exhibit many
biological effects including apoptosis induction through
undefined mechanisms. We recently discovered that orphan
nuclear receptor Nur77 migrates from the nucleus to the
mitochondria, where it binds to Bcl-2 to induce apoptosis.
Here, we report that certain shikonin derivatives could
modulate the Nur77/Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway by increasing
levels of Nur77 protein and promoting its mitochondrial
targeting in cancer cells. Structural modification of
acetylshikonin resulted in the identification of a derivative
5,8-diacetoxyl-6-(1¶-acetoxyl-4¶-methyl-3¶-pentenyl)-1,4-naphthaquinones (SK07) that exhibited improved efficacy and
specificity in activating the pathway. Unlike other Nur77
modulators, shikonins increased the levels of Nur77 protein
through their posttranscriptional regulation. The apoptotic
effect of SK07 was impaired in Nur77 knockout cells and
suppressed by cotreatment with leptomycin B that inhibited
Nur77 cytoplasmic localization. Furthermore, SK07 induced
apoptosis in cells expressing the COOH-terminal half of
Nur77 protein but not its NH2-terminal region. Our data also
showed that SK07-induced apoptosis was associated with a
Bcl-2 conformational change and Bax activation. Together,
our results show that certain shikonin derivatives act as
modulators of the Nur77-mediated apoptotic pathway and
identify a new shikonin-based lead that targets Nur77 for
apoptosis induction. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):8871–80]

Introduction
Nur77 (also known as TR3 or NGFI-B), an orphan member of the
steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily and an immediateearly response gene, plays a critical role in the regulation of
differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and survival of many
different cell types (1, 2). Although the growth-promoting effect of
Nur77 has been described in various tumors (3, 4), Nur77 expression
also mediates the killing effects of a variety of apoptotic stimuli such
as synthetic retinoids, calcium ionophores, etoposide, phorbol ester,
chenodeoxycholic acid derivatives, di-n-butyltin dichloride, histone

deacetylase inhibitors, cadmium, and 1,1-bis(3¶-indolyl)-1(p-substituted phenyl)methanes in cancer cells (5–9). The apoptotic
effect of Nur77 seems to be clinically relevant as the expression of
the Nur77 subfamily member Nor-1 is positively correlated with
survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with
chemotherapeutic drugs (10), and down-regulation of Nur77 is
associated with the metastasis of primary solid tumors (11).
One of the mechanisms that regulate the opposing biological
activities of Nur77, survival and death, is through its subcellular
localization. Nur77 confers its growth-promoting activities through
its action in the nucleus (12, 13), which requires its DNA-binding
and transactivation. In contrast, the apoptotic effect of Nur77 is
transcription-independent and occurs in the absence of its DNAbinding domain (5, 8, 14–16). In this case, Nur77 initiates apoptotic
cascades by migrating to the mitochondria where it interacts with the
Bcl-2 apoptotic machinery by converting Bcl-2 from a protector to a
killer (16, 17). Such a Nur77/Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway has been used by
a variety of apoptosis-inducing agents in prostate cancer, lung cancer,
colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and gastric cancer cells (2, 8, 14, 15,
17, 18). In this regard, Nur77 and Bcl-2 are often overexpressed in
cancer cells, providing an excellent opportunity to preferentially
induce apoptosis of these cells by inducing Nur77 migration and Bcl-2
conversion (1, 17). Such an approach may be highly effective in
inducing cancer apoptosis because it engages a simultaneous
suppression of the survival function of Nur77 and Bcl-2, and activation
of their proapoptotic potential (1, 17). Thus, agents that specifically
activate the Nur77-mediated pathway may have therapeutic potential.
In an effort to identify new modulators of the Nur77/Bcl-2
apoptotic pathway, we have undertaken the screening of a natural
product library prepared from Chinese herbal medicines. Here, we
report that certain shikonin derivatives, active components of the
Chinese medicinal plant, Lithospermum erythrorhizon (19, 20),
could activate the Nur77-mediated apoptotic pathway in cancer
cells. Further evaluation of acetylshikonin analogues showed that
5,8-diacetoxyl-6-(1¶-acetoxyl-4¶-methyl-3¶-pentenyl)-1,4-naphthaquinones (SK07) was more active than its parental compound in
inducing Nur77 expression and apoptosis. Our mechanistic studies
revealed that SK07 increased the levels of Nur77 protein in cancer
cells through its posttranscriptional regulation and that it killed
cancer cells by inducing Bcl-2 conformational change and Bax
activation in a Nur77-dependent manner. Together, our studies
identify new modulators of the Nur77/Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway and
a potential target-based anticancer lead.

Signaling Technology, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes from Millipore,
and a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors (80-6501-23) from Amersham were
used in this study. All other chemicals used were commercial products of
analytic grade obtained from Sigma.
Preparation of acetylshikonin and analogues. L. erythrorhizon grown
in Liao-ning Province in Northeast China were extracted with hexane by
Soxhlet apparatus and subjected to purification for shikonin derivative
compounds (19, 20). Acetylshikonin (SK03) and two isomers of SK03
analogues, SK06 [5,8-diacetoxyl-2-(1¶-acetoxyl-4¶-methyl-3¶-pentenyl)-1,4naphthaquinones] and SK07 [5,8-diacetoxyl-6-(1¶-acetoxyl-4¶-methyl-3¶pentenyl)-1,4-naphthaquinones], were synthesized (Fig. 1A). Molecular
structures were identified using spectroscopic techniques including
electron ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy,
and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.
Cell culture. NIH-H460 lung cancer and HeLa cervical cancer cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640, whereas HEK293T human embryonic kidney, mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and MEF Nur77 / cells were maintained in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 at 37jC. Subconfluent cells with exponential growth
were used throughout the experiments. Cell transfections were carried out
by using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions of the
manufacturer.
Cell lysis and fraction. Cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells with
modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 50 mmol/L of
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L of NaCl, 5 mmol/L of EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS with a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors
on ice for 30 min. For cellular fractionation, cells were lysed in cold buffer A
[10 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9) at 4jC, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl,
0.5 mmol/L DTT] with a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors on ice for 10 min.
The cytoplasmic fraction was collected by centrifuging at 6,000 rpm for
30 s. Pellets containing nuclei were resuspended in cold high-salt buffer C
[20 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mmol/L NaCl,
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT], with a cocktail
of proteinase inhibitors on ice for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed by
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4jC for 15 min. Protein concentrations were
determined using the Bradford method according to the instructions of the
manufacturer (Bio-Rad).
Western blotting. Equal amounts of the lysates were electrophoresed on
an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes, which were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20] for
1 h, incubated with various primary antibodies for 2 h and detected with
either anti-rabbit (1:5,000) or anti-mouse (1:5,000) secondary antibodies for
1 h using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. The dilutions of the
primary antibodies were anti-Nur77 (sc-5569) in 1:1,000, anti-PARP in
1:1,000, anti–Bcl-2 in 1:1,000, and anti-Bax in 1:1,000. The blots were
reprobed with anti–h-actin antibody for loading control.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells mounted on glass slides were
permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mol/L of
glycine for 15 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for
30 min at room temperature, followed with incubation with various primary
antibodies at 37jC for 1 h and detected by FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG
(1:400) or anti-goat IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:400) at room temperature
for 30 min. Cells were costained with 4¶6¶-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
to visualize nuclei. The images were taken under a fluorescent microscope
(Carl Zeiss) or an LSM-510 confocal laser scanning microscope system (Carl
Zeiss). The primary antibodies included monoclonal anti-Nur77 antibody
(R&D Systems, 1:200), anti–cytochrome c (1:500), anti–cleaved caspase-3

(1:500), anti-Hsp60 (1:500), anti–Bcl-2 (1:500), anti–Bcl-2 BH3 (1:500), and
anti-Bax (6A7; 1:500).
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNAs were isolated by
Trizol LS. The first-strand synthesis was performed with RevertAid
First-Strand cDNA synthesis kits (Fermentas) according to the instructions
of the manufacturer. The primers includes those for Nur77 ( forward primer,
5¶-TCA TGG ACG GCT ACA CAG-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-GTA GGC ATG GAA
TAG CTC-3¶) and h-actin ( forward primer, 5¶-CTG GAG AAG AGC TAC
GAG-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-TGA TGG AGT TGA AGG TAG-3¶). PCR reactions
were performed in Eppendorf AG 22331 Hamburg (Eppendorf). Cycling
conditions were 30 s denaturation at 94jC, 30 s annealing at 55jC and 30 s
elongation at 72jC for 35 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2%
agarose gels and gel images were captured with a Gel logic 200 system
(Kodak).
Apoptosis assays. For DAPI staining, cells were incubated with vehicle
or with different concentrations of acetylshikonin and analogues in serumfree medium for 24 h. Detached and attached cells were collected and
incubated in PBS containing 50 Ag/mL of DAPI and 100 Ag/mL of DNasefree RNase A at 37jC for 20 min. Apoptotic cells were identified with typical
morphology of shrinkage of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and
nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation. At least 300 cells from more
than five random microscopic fields were counted by two independent
investigators. For flow cytometry analysis, cells treated with vehicle, SK07,
or SK03 in serum-free medium for 24 h were collected and stained with
Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) using Vybrant apoptosis assay kit no. 2
according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and analyzed by flow
cytometry (Beckman Coulter EPICS ALTRA).
Nur77 mutants and transfection. Two different fragments of Nur77,
N-Nur77 (A/B domain) and C-Nur77 (LBD domain), were generated by PCR
and inserted into the EcoRI/SalI site of pEGFP vector. The Nur77 mutants
were verified by sequencing. HEK293T cells transfected with Nur77,
N-Nur77, or C-Nur77 were treated with 5 Amol/L of SK07 or vehicle in
serum-free medium for 8 h, and stained with DAPI. Apoptosis of transfected
cells were examined as described above.
Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean F SD. Each assay was
repeated in triplicate in three independent experiments. Statistical
significance of differences between groups was analyzed by using Student’s
t test or ANOVA analysis. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Acetylshikonin and analogues increase levels of Nur77
protein through posttranscriptional regulation. To identify
new modulators of the Nur77-mediated apoptotic pathway (17),
we screened a natural product library consisting of 3,000 extracts
and pure compounds prepared from known Chinese herbs with
therapeutic indications (21). Our results show that several
shikonin derivatives could increase the levels of Nur77 protein
and apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, including NIH-H460
lung cancer, HeLa cervical cancer, HepG2 liver cancer, MCF7
breast cancer, and MGC-803 gastric cancer cells (data not
shown). We report here our characterization of the acetyl
derivative of shikonin, SK03 (Fig. 1A). Treatment of NIH-H460
and HeLa cells with SK03 resulted in the strong induction of
Nur77 protein levels (Fig. 1B and C). In NIH-H460 cells that
express high basal Nur77 protein levels, we consistently observed
that SK03 could increase Nur77 levels by f3-fold to 5-fold in a
concentration range between 5 and 10 Amol/L for 12 or 24 hours
(Fig. 1B), whereas the effect of SK03 was even more significant in
HeLa cells that express low basal Nur77 levels (Fig. 1C). Thus,
acetylshikonin SK03 can enhance the levels of Nur77 protein in
cancer cells.
In order to identify more effective and selective modulators of
the Nur77-mediated apoptotic pathway, two acetylshikonin derivatives, SK06 and SK07, were synthesized (Fig. 1A). SK06 and SK07

analogues. B, induction of Nur77
expression by shikonins in NIH-H460
lung cancer cells. Western blotting
analysis was used to evaluate the effect of
shikonins on Nur77 protein levels (top ).
NIH-H460 cells were treated with SK03,
SK06, SK07 (5 or 10 Amol/L), or vehicle for
12 or 24 h. Nur77 protein expression was
detected by using anti-Nur77 antibody.
The blots were reprobed with anti–h-actin
antibody for loading control. As for
RT-PCR analysis (bottom ) of Nur77 mRNA
expression, the same cells were treated
with SK03, SK06, or SK07 (5 Amol/L) for
3 h, whereas TPA (100 ng/mL) was used
as a positive control. Total RNA were
purified and subjected to RT-PCR analysis.
Nur77 and h-actin products were
simultaneously amplified by including
primers for both Nur77 and h-actin in the
same reaction system, in which h-actin
expression level served as an internal
control. C, induction of Nur77 expression
by shikonins in HeLa cervical cancer cells.
HeLa cells were treated with shikonins
as indicated. Anti-Nur77 antibody was
used to detect the expression of Nur77
protein by Western blotting analysis.
D, dose-dependent and time-dependent
induction of Nur77. Cells were treated with
vehicle or with SK07 at 1, 5, or 10 Amol/L
in serum-free medium for the indicated
period of time. Nur77 expression was
determined by Western blotting analysis
using anti-Nur77 antibody.

were triacetate shikonins that were designed to explore whether
modification of pharmacophore quinine, which is the common
moiety of various shikonin derivatives, could improve their
regulation of Nur77 activities. Analysis of their effect on levels of
Nur77 protein in NIH-H460 (Fig. 1B) and HeLa (Fig. 1C) cells
showed that the ability of SK03 in increasing Nur77 protein levels
was retained in SK07 but impaired in SK06. Thus, the pharmacophore quinine in shikonins is an important determinant for their
modulation of Nur77 protein levels in cancer cells.

The induction of Nur77 protein levels by SK07 was dosedependent and time-dependent (Fig. 1D). Treatment of NIH-H460
cells with SK07 at 1, 5, and 10 Amol/L for 6 hours did not show any
effect on Nur77 expression. However, the levels of Nur77 were
increased when cells were treated for 12 hours. Although 10 Amol/L
was required for optimal induction of Nur77 expression when cells
were treated for 12 hours, 1 Amol/L of SK07 was sufficient for the
maximal increase of Nur77 proteins when cells were treated with
the compound for 24 hours. Such a time-dependent effect of SK07

on Nur77 expression was interesting because induction of Nur77 by
growth factors and apoptotic stimuli, such as 3-Cl-AHPC, is often
rapid and transient (22). We therefore determined whether
shikonins could regulate Nur77 expression at the transcriptional
level. NIH-H460 cells were treated with vehicle or with SK03, SK06,
or SK07 at 5 Amol/L for 3 hours and their effect on Nur77
transcript was examined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR;
ref. Fig. 1B). As a positive control, cells were treated with phorbol
ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (TPA; 100 ng/mL),
which is known to induce Nur77 expression in NIH-H460 cells (4).
Consistent with previous reports, TPA could significantly upregulate Nur77 mRNA expression. However, we did not detect clear
changes in Nur77 mRNA level when cells were treated with SK03,
SK06, or SK07 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the induction of Nur77
protein by SK03 and SK07 is not due to their transcriptional
regulation of Nur77 expression.
Role of Nur77 in shikonin-induced apoptosis. We next
determined whether Nur77 expression played a role in shikonininduced apoptosis. NIH-H460 cells were treated with 5 Amol/L of
SK03, SK06, SK07, or vehicle for 24 hours and apoptosis was
analyzed by DAPI staining (Fig. 2A). Although apoptosis was
seldom seen in untreated cells (7%), a significant number of cells
underwent apoptosis when treated with SK03 (22%) or SK07 (33%).
In contrast, SK06 exerted much less effect on apoptosis (14%).
Thus, the apoptotic effect of shikonins correlated with their
induction of Nur77 protein in cancer cells, suggesting that Nur77
expression contributes to their death effect.
The apoptotic effect of SK07 was also shown by its induction of
PARP cleavage, a sensitive apoptotic marker occurring early in the
apoptotic response (23). In NIH-H460 cells, SK07-induced PARP
cleavage was visible at 6 hours post-treatment, which was
increased upon longer treatments (Fig. 2B). HeLa cells were more
sensitive to SK07 as PARP cleavage occurred when cells were
treated with SK07 for 3 hours, with the optimal effect seen between
12 and 24 hours (Fig. 2B). We also examined whether SK07
treatment activated caspase-3, a major executioner caspase known
to cleave PARP (23). Immunostaining using an antibody specifically
against the active caspase-3 showed that SK07 treatment of NIHH460 cells resulted in the activation of caspase-3, as a significant
amount of SK07-treated cells displayed strong immunostaining,
whereas control cells did not (Fig. 2B).
The role of Nur77 in mediating the apoptotic effect of SK07 was
also examined by studying the effect of Nur77 transfection in
HEK293T cells that are resistant to SK07 (data not shown).
Treatment with 5 Amol/L of SK07 did not induce a clear apoptosis
of HEK293T cells. However, SK07 induced an extensive apoptosis in
HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-Nur77 (f32%; Fig. 2C). SK07
also induced the apoptosis of HEK293T cells transfected with the
COOH-terminal region of Nur77 (C-Nur77) but not the NH2terminal Nur77 region (N-Nur77). The fact that the COOH-terminal
E/F domain of Nur77 is sufficient for mediating the apoptotic effect
of SK07 suggests that DNA binding and transactivation of Nur77
are not required for mediating the apoptotic effect of SK07.
To further determine the role of Nur77 expression, we evaluated
the death effect of SK07 in MEF and Nur77 knockout MEF (MEF
Nur77 / ) cells by flow cytometry for Annexin V and PI staining.
Annexin V staining serves as a measure of phosphatidylserine
externalization and cells that are Annexin V+/PI represent early
apoptotic cells (24). A representative experiment (Fig. 2D) showed
that early apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/PI ; 14.6% and 57%) were
seen in MEF treated with 1 and 10 Amol/L of SK07, respectively. In

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

contrast, Annexin V+/PI staining was significantly reduced in MEF
Nur77 / cells (3.38% with 1 Amol/L and 23.7% with 10 Amol/L
SK07 treatment). These results show that the apoptotic effect of
SK07 largely depends on Nur77 expression, although other protein
factors may mediate its effect when a high concentration of SK07
is used. Interestingly, SK03 treatment (10 Amol/L) resulted in a
significant amount of late apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/PI+) in
more than half of both MEF cells (54.6%) and MEF Nur77 /
cells (66.8%). In addition, SK03 caused significant necrotic cell
death in both MEF cells (31%) and MEF Nur77 / cells (11.9%),
suggesting that SK03 may induce cell death mainly through Nur77independent pathways.
SK07 induces Nur77 nuclear export and mitochondrial
targeting. To determine whether acetylshikonin and its analogues
could induce cytoplasmic localization of Nur77, the hallmark of the
Nur77-mediated apoptotic pathway (17), we examined their effect
on the subcellular localization of Nur77 in NIH-H460 cells. As shown
in Fig. 3A, Nur77 immunostaining was significantly enhanced in
cells treated with SK03 and SK07, but not with SK06, consistent with
their induction of Nur77 protein level. For comparison, TPA also
strongly induced Nur77 immunostaining. However, TPA-induced
Nur77 immunostaining was confined to the nucleus, as reported
previously (4). In contrast, most of the cells treated with SK03 and
SK07 displayed a diffused distribution of Nur77. Predominant
cytoplasmic localization of Nur77 could be seen in some treated
cells, which was more apparent when treated with SK07 than
with SK03. These results suggested that SK03 and SK07 induced
the cytoplasmic localization of Nur77. Cytoplasmic localization of
Nur77 observed in cells treated with SK07 might be due to its
induction of Nur77 nuclear export, as leptomycin B (LMB), which is
known to block CRM1-dependent nuclear export (25), significantly
inhibited SK07-induced Nur77 cytoplasmic accumulation. To
confirm the effect of shikonins on inducing cytoplasmic localization
of Nur77, cytosolic and nuclear fractions of cells treated with SK03,
SK06, or SK07 were prepared and analyzed for levels of Nur77
protein by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, Nur77 was
predominantly nuclear (92%) in control cells. However, in cells
treated with SK03 and SK07, a significant amount (65% and 85%,
respectively) of Nur77 protein was cytoplasmic. In contrast, only
30% of Nur77 protein resided in the cytoplasm when treated with
SK06. Consistent with immunostaining results, pretreatment of cells
with LMB reduced the amount of SK07-induced cytoplasmic Nur77
from 85% to 42%. Thus, SK07 is more effective than SK03 and SK06
in inducing cytoplasmic localization of Nur77.
To determine whether SK07-induced cytoplasmic Nur77 could
associate with mitochondria, NIH-H460 cells treated with SK07 or
vehicle were immunostained with anti-Nur77 antibody and
antibody against Hsp60, a mitochondria-specific protein. Confocal
microscopy analysis showed that the distribution of Nur77
extensively overlapped with that of Hsp60 when cells were treated
with SK07 (Fig. 3C). To confirm the ability of SK07 to induce Nur77
mitochondrial targeting, an expression vector encoding GFP-Nur77
was transfected into NIH-H460 cells and its subcellular distribution
in cells treated with or without SK07 was examined. As shown in
Fig. 3D, GFP-Nur77 was exclusively nuclear in untreated cells, but it
was found in the cytoplasm and colocalized with Hsp60 when cells
were treated with SK07. Thus, SK07 can induce Nur77 mitochondrial targeting.
SK07-induced apoptosis is dependent on cytoplasmic
localization of Nur77. To study whether the cytoplasmic
localization of Nur77 was required for the killing activity of SK07,

C and D, Nur77 mitochondrial targeting.
NIH-H460 cells transfected with or without
GFP-Nur77 were treated with 5 Amol/L
of SK07 for 24 h. Endogenous Nur77
expression was immunostained with
anti-Nur77 antibody. Cells were costained
with anti-Hsp60 antibody to recognize the
mitochondria and with DAPI to visualize the
nuclei. Fluorescent microscopy was used
to determine the overlap of Nur77 and
Hsp60.

NIH-H460 cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of SK07 and
subsequently stained with anti-Nur77 antibody and DAPI. Microscopic analysis showed that treatment of cells with SK07 resulted
in a significant amount of cells displaying cytoplasmic localization
of Nur77, many of them showing nuclear morphology typical of
apoptosis (f45%; Fig. 4A). However, when cells were cotreated
with LMB, SK07-induced Nur77 protein mainly resided in the
nucleus, and cells displayed normal nuclear morphology. The
inhibitory effect of LMB on SK07-induced apoptosis was confirmed
by Annexin V staining (Fig. 4B). Flow cytometry analysis showed
that NIH-H460 cells treated with 5 Amol/L of SK07 resulted in

extensive early apoptosis (37.9% Annexin V+/PI cells). This level of
apoptosis was dramatically reduced (4.9% Annexin V+/PI cells)
when cells were cotreated with LMB. We also determined the effect
of LMB on SK07-induced cytoplasmic localization of GFP-Nur77
and apoptosis. NIH-H460 cells transfected with GFP-Nur77 were
exposed to 10 Amol/L of SK07 for 24 hours, and apoptosis was
examined by DAPI staining. In the absence of treatment, GFPNur77 resided in the nucleus and no apparent apoptotic cells were
detected (Fig. 4C). However, GFP-Nur77 could be found in the
cytoplasm of cells treated with SK07, which was coincident with
extensive nuclear condensation and fragmentation with f80%

apoptosis. In the presence of LMB, SK07-induced apoptosis was
decreased to f16%. Again, inhibition of apoptosis by LMB was
accompanied by its inhibition of the cytoplasmic localization of
GFP-Nur77. Together, these results show that the cytoplasmic
localization of Nur77 plays a critical role in mediating the apoptotic
effect of SK07.
SK07 induces Bcl-2 conformational change. Cytoplasmic
Nur77 is known to bind Bcl-2, inducing a Bcl-2 conformational
change that is proapoptotic (16, 17). To determine whether
cytoplasmic Nur77 could colocalize with Bcl-2, NIH-H460 cells
treated with SK07 or vehicle were immunostained with anti-Nur77
and anti–Bcl-2 antibodies. Microscopic analysis showed that the

distribution pattern of SK07-induced cytoplasmic Nur77 overlapped extensively with that of Bcl-2 (Fig. 5A). Cotreatment with
LMB inhibited the colocalization of Nur77 and Bcl-2 by preventing
Nur77 cytoplasmic localization. In transfection experiments, we
also observed that SK07-induced cytoplasmic GFP-Nur77 colocalized with Bcl-2 expression (data not shown). The colocalization of
cytoplasmic Nur77 with Bcl-2 suggests that SK07-induced Nur77
might interact with Bcl-2.
Interaction of Nur77 with Bcl-2 induces a Bcl-2 conformational
change with its BH3 domain exposed (17). Such a Bcl-2
conformation is proapoptotic and can be detected by anti–Bcl-2
antibody against the BH3 domain of Bcl-2, anti–Bcl-2(BH3), (17). To

Figure 5. SK07 induces Bcl-2 conformational change and Bax activation.
A, colocalization of Nur77 with Bcl-2. NIH-H460 cells treated with vehicle or
5 Amol/L of SK07 in the presence or absence of LMB (10 ng/mL) for 24 h were
subjected to costaining with anti-Nur77 and anti–Bcl-2 antibodies. Fluorescent
microscopy was used to analyze the subcellular localization of Nur77 and Bcl-2.
B, Bcl-2 conformational change and Bax activation. NIH-H460 cells treated
with 5 Amol/L of SK07 were examined for Bcl-2 conformational change by
anti–Bcl-2(BH3) antibody. Its association with Bax activation was analyzed by
costaining with anti-Bax(6A7) antibody. Cells were also stained with DAPI to
visualize the nucleus. C, translocation of Bax to mitochondria. NIH-H460 cells
treated with 5 Amol/L of SK07 were examined for Bax activation by antibody

colocalization with mitochondria. DAPI staining was used to visualize the nuclei.
The colocalization of active Bax with mitochondria and their association with
apoptotic nuclear morphology were compared. D, Bax activation and cytochrome

anti-Bax(6A7) and anti–cytochrome c (Cyt c ) antibodies. Bax activation was
compared with its induction of cytochrome c release as indicated by diffusive
cytochrome c staining. LMB was used to determine its effect on both Bax
activation and cytochrome c release.

study whether SK07 induced a Bcl-2 conformational change, NIHH460 cells treated with SK07 or vehicle were immunostained with
the anti–Bcl-2(BH3) antibody. Although Bcl-2 is highly expressed in
NIH-H460 cells, which could be stained with anti–Bcl-2 antibody
against the whole Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 5A), it was not stained by the
anti–Bcl-2(BH3) antibody (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Bcl-2 was
antiapoptotic in untreated NIH-H460 cells. However, when cells
were treated with SK07, we observed a strong immunostaining by
the anti–Bcl-2(BH3) antibody (Fig. 5B). Thus, SK07 is able to induce
a Bcl-2 conformational change, likely through Nur77/Bcl-2
interaction.
SK07 induces Bax activation. An unresolved issue in the
Nur77/Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway is whether Bcl-2 conformational
change is sufficient to induce apoptosis or whether the exposed
BH3 domain of Bcl-2 acts as a BH3-only protein that induces
apoptosis through activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members
and/or inhibition of antiapoptotic members (17, 26). Thus, we
determined whether Bax activation was involved in SK07-induced
apoptosis by immunostaining NIH-H460 cells with anti-Bax(6A7)
antibody that recognizes activated Bax. Untreated NIH-H460 cells
were not immunostained by the anti-Bax(6A7) antibody, suggesting
that Bax was inactive in the cells (Fig. 5B). However, cells treated
with SK07 displayed strong immunostaining with the anti-Bax(6A7)
antibody, demonstrating that SK07 could activate Bax. Our
observation that SK07-treated cells stained by both anti–Bcl2(BH3) and anti-Bax(6A7) antibodies suggests that SK07-induced
Bcl-2 conformational change may play a role in Bax activation.
Bax resides predominantly in the cytosol before its activation
and apoptosis induction. During early apoptosis, Bax undergoes
conformational change and oligomerization, resulting in its
translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria (27). We then
examined whether Bax could associate with mitochondria in SK07treated cells. Microscopic analysis showed an extensive colocalization of active Bax with mitochondrial-specific protein Hsp60
(Fig. 5C). Furthermore, cells with active Bax immunostaining often
displayed nuclear condensation (Fig. 5C), suggesting that SK07induced apoptosis might involve Bax activation. To further confirm
this association, NIH-H460 cells were costained with anti-Bax(6A7)
and anti–cytochrome c antibodies. In control cells, cytochrome c
displayed a punctate immunostaining pattern, consistent with its
mitochondrial localization (Fig. 5D). However, cytochrome c was
diffusely distributed in SK07-treated cells with active Bax
immunostaining. Thus, SK07-induced Bax activation was associated with cytochrome c release. LMB cotreatment, which prevented
Nur77 nuclear export and Bcl-2 conformational change, almost
completely inhibited SK07-induced Bax activation and cytochrome
c release (Fig. 5D).
SK07 does not affect Bcl-2 and Bax expression. Because it has
been widely reported that the ratio between Bcl-2 and Bax
determines cell survival or death (26), we next examined whether
the apoptotic effect of SK07 was due to its effect on Bcl-2 and Bax
expression. The result showed that SK07 caused no apparent
change in level of either Bcl-2 or Bax for treatment time ranging
from 3 to 24 hours (Fig. 6). Thus, SK07 induces apoptosis through
the induction of Bcl-2 conformational change and Bax activation
rather than affecting Bcl-2/Bax ratio.

Acetylshikonins Activate Nur77-Mediated Apoptosis

metabolites, are a rich source of therapeutic leads (21). Recent
examples include the discoveries of paclitaxel and camptothecin
(28, 29). Shikonin derivatives, mainly contained in the roots of the
Chinese plant L. erythrorhizon, are the naturally occurring
naphthoquinones that embody numerous active compounds with
a unique pharmacophore quinone moiety (19). These compounds
are promising drug candidates as they have been reported to have
multiple anticancer effects in vitro and in animals (19, 20).
However, a rational design of shikonin analogues is necessary in
order to reduce the nonspecific toxicity of shikonins, which has
prevented them from clinical development.
Nur77 is a unique orphan member of the nuclear receptor
superfamily (1). It is perhaps the most potent proapoptotic
member in the nuclear receptor superfamily (16, 17). Recently,
we showed a new paradigm in cancer cell apoptosis through Nur77
mitochondrial targeting (17, 30), which was later confirmed by
other groups (15, 16, 18). We showed that apoptosis of cancer cells
induced by certain apoptotic agents requires Nur77 expression and
its translocation from the nucleus to mitochondria where Nur77
interacts with Bcl-2, resulting in a Bcl-2 conformational change
that converts it into a cytodestructive molecule (17). These findings
suggest that agents which induce cytoplasmic localization of Nur77
and its interaction with Bcl-2 may preferentially kill cancer cells
with elevated Bcl-2 levels.
In the course of identifying new agents that modulate the Nur77mediated apoptotic pathway, we report here our finding that
certain shikonin derivatives could activate the Nur77 pathway
through their induction of Nur77 expression, nuclear export,
mitochondrial targeting, Bcl-2 conformational change, and Bax
activation. These results are consistent with previous report that
shikonin-like compounds can induce apoptosis through mitochondria and caspase pathway with unknown mechanisms (31). Our
current finding that certain shikonins could regulate the Nur77mediated apoptotic pathway sets the stage for rational design of
shikonin analogues with improved anticancer efficacy and
specificity. It is generally believed that the nonspecific toxicity of
shikonins is caused by the electronic transfer of hydroxyl groups
between 1-a and C-11 positions and subsequently occurring
alkylation (20). Our current study indicates that certain esteration
of 1-a carbonyl group of acetylshikonins such as SK07 can enhance
apoptosis by promoting Nur77 expression and migration. We found
that the introduction of acetyl groups into the pharmacophore
quinoid moiety of SK03 exerted a great effect on its modulation of
Nur77 activity. Induction of Nur77 protein levels by SK03 in cancer

Figure 6. SK07 does not affect Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels. Cells were
treated with vehicle or 5 Amol/L of SK07 for the indicated periods of time. Total

cells was retained in SK07 (Fig. 1B and C). Interestingly, the ability
of inducing Nur77 cytoplasmic localization by SK03 was significantly enhanced in SK07 but was reduced in SK06 (Fig. 3A and B).
The distinct abilities to induce Nur77 expression and Nur77
cytoplasmic translocation shown in different shikonin derivatives
(SK07 and SK06) suggest that quinoid modification is an important
determinant for their modulation of Nur77 activities, including its
stability and nuclear export.
Our results showed that an increase of Nur77 protein levels and its
cytoplasmic localization were associated with the apoptotic effect of
shikonins. Treatment of NIH-H460 cells with SK07, which induced
Nur77 expression and nuclear export, resulted in cytochrome c
release from the mitochondria (Fig. 5D), caspase-3 activation, and
PARP cleavage (Fig. 2B). SK07-induced apoptosis was dependent on
Nur77 expression level as its killing effect was largely impaired in
MEF Nur77 / cells when compared with MEF cells (Fig. 2D) and
enhanced by Nur77 transfection (Figs. 2C and 4C). The apoptotic
effect of SK07 could be observed in other cancer cells such as HeLa
cells (Figs. 1C and 2B; data not shown), consistent with the role of
Nur77 expression in different types of cancer cells (8, 14, 15, 18). Our
results also showed that SK07-induced apoptosis was associated
with cytoplasmic localization of Nur77 because cytoplasmic
accumulation of both endogenous Nur77 and transfected Nur77
was accompanied with nuclear condensation and fragmentation
(Fig. 4A and C). In addition, LMB blockage of Nur77 cytoplasmic
localization significantly inhibited SK07-induced Bax activation,
cytochrome c release (Fig. 5D), and apoptosis (Fig. 4). Consistently,
deletion of the DNA-binding domain from Nur77 did not affect the
apoptotic effect of SK07 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2C).
In studying the mechanism by which cytoplasmic Nur77 induced
apoptosis, we found that SK07-induced cytoplasmic Nur77 targeted
mitochondria (Fig. 3C and D) probably through its interaction with
Bcl-2 (Fig. 5A), leading to Bcl-2 conformational changes that
exposes its BH3 domain (Fig. 5B). These results confirmed our
previous finding that cytoplasmic Nur77 could target mitochondria
and induce Bcl-2 conversion (17). Interestingly, our results showed
that SK07-induced Bcl-2 conformational change was associated
with Bax activation (Fig. 5B). This observation is significant, as it
would suggest that the converted Bcl-2 requires Bax activation for
apoptosis induction. Although it is unclear how converted Bcl-2
activates Bax, it can be envisioned that the converted Bcl-2, with its
BH3 domain exposed, may act directly or indirectly on Bax,
resulting in Bax activation and apoptosis.
Besides its improved efficacy in inducing apoptosis, SK07 may
have improved selectivity towards the Nur77-mediated apoptotic
pathway. Shikonins are known to modulate multiple signal
transduction pathways, including inhibition of DNA topoisomerases (31), induction of reactive oxygen species release (32),
and inhibition of survival pathways involving extracellular signalregulated kinase, Akt, and nuclear factor nB activities (33).
Interestingly, the apoptotic effect of SK07 was largely impaired in
Nur77 knockout cells (Fig. 2D). By contrast, SK03, the parent
compound of SK07, induced a significant amount of late apoptotic
and necrotic death cells in both MEF and MEF Nur77 / cells
(Fig. 2D), suggesting that its biological activities largely depended
on Nur77-independent pathways. Improved Nur77 selectivity, as
that observed with SK07, may be therapeutically desirable as
Nur77 is often overexpressed in cancer cells compared with normal
cells. Such a tumor selectivity can be further ensured by the fact
that the Nur77-mediated apoptotic pathway targets Bcl-2, the
expression of which is also often elevated in cancer cells (17). Thus,

SK07 may represent a new drug lead that induces cancer cell death
