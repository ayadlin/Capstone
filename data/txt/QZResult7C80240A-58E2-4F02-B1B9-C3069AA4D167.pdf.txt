Ligand-Induced Degradation

Abstract
Activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) triggers signaling pathways regulating various cellular events that
contribute to tissue development and function. Aberrant activation of EGFR contributes to tumor progression as well as therapeutic resistance in patients with cancer. C-terminal tensin-like (CTEN; TNS4) is a focal
adhesion molecule that is a member of the tensin family. Its expression is upregulated by EGF and elevated
CTEN mediates EGF-induced cell migration. In the presence of CTEN, we found that EGF treatment elevated
the level of EGFR protein but not mRNA. The extended half-life of activated EGFR sustained its signaling
cascades. CTEN reduced ligand-induced EGFR degradation by binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and
decreasing the ubiquitination of EGFR. The Src homology 2 domain of CTEN is not only required for binding
to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue at codon 774 of c-Cbl, but is also essential for the tumorigenicity
observed in the presence of CTEN. Public database analyses indicated that CTEN mRNA levels are elevated
in breast, colon, lung, and pancreas cancers, but not correlated with EGFR mRNA levels in these cancers. In
contrast, immunohistochemistry analyses of lung cancer specimens showed that CTEN and EGFR protein
levels were positively associated, in support of our ﬁnding that CTEN regulates EGFR protein levels through a
posttranslational mechanism. Overall, this work deﬁnes a function for CTEN in prolonging signaling from
EGFR by reducing its ligand-induced degradation. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5266–76. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase engages a vast array of
signaling pathways to regulate tissue development and
homeostasis (1, 2). EGFR signaling is normally induced by
ligand binding (such as EGF), leading to receptor dimerization,
autophosphorylation, activation of downstream signaling
molecules, and cellular events such as proliferation, migration,
and differentiation. Given its importance, EGFR signaling is
tightly regulated. Ligand binding not only induces receptor
activation but also triggers suppression mechanisms to ensure
precise control of EGFR signaling output (3). One of the
negative regulations is governed through ubiquitin-dependent
EGFR degradation, which is largely mediated by the RING
ﬁnger E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. c-Cbl binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR through its tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB)
domain, allowing recruitment of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and transfer of ubiquitin to phosphorylated EGFR.
Ubiquitination of EGFR then facilitates its internalization and
degradation in lysosomes (4). Disruption of this negative

regulatory system could trigger cellular events that contribute
to tumor formation.
Focal adhesions connect extracellular matrix to cytoskeletal
networks and play critical roles in cell adhesion, migration,
proliferation, and survival. They are also involved in cross-talk
with growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, to elicit a wider
range of cellular responses. C-terminal tensin-like (CTEN) is
the smallest protein in the tensin focal adhesion family (5)
known to regulate cell adhesion and migration (6). Less
amount of, if any, CTEN is expressed in normal tissues including breast, lung, ovary, and colon (7). However, its expression is
profoundly increased when these tissues develop tumors. In
colon cancer, 76% of patients' tumor samples exhibit signiﬁcantly elevated CTEN protein levels (8), which is associated
with poor prognosis (9). In invasive breast cancer, CTEN
expression correlates with high EGFR and HER2 levels, as well
as with metastasis to lymph nodes (6), and is associated with
poor prognosis (10). Manipulation of CTEN protein levels alters
cell invasion, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and
colony formation capacities of colon cancer cells (8, 11).
Activation of EGFR by EGF leads to an expressional switch
from tensin 3 (TNS3) to CTEN, and this upregulation of CTEN
with reduced TNS3 contributes to EGF-promoted mammary
cell migration (6). Mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) activity is required for EGFinduced CTEN overexpression (6). Consistently, it is reported
that gain-of-function mutations in K-RAS and B-RAF (both
upstream molecules of MEK) are associated with CTEN overexpression (12). Altogether, these ﬁndings closely link CTEN to
EGFR signaling cascades.

CTEN Regulates EGFR Signaling

In the present study, we have identiﬁed a novel role for CTEN
in EGFR regulation. Our data indicate that CTEN suppresses
ligand-induced EGFR degradation by reducing receptor ubiquitination, which is accomplished via the ability of CTEN to
interact with c-Cbl in a phosphotyrosine-SH2–dependent
manner. Overexpression of CTEN enhances cancer cell migration, invasion, as well as colony formation activities, which can
be reversed by EGFR inhibitor. In addition, the Src homology 2
(SH2) domain of CTEN is essential for promoting these tumorigenic properties. The clinical relevance of our ﬁndings is
supported by the upregulation of CTEN mRNA in a variety of
cancer types and the correlation of elevated CTEN and EGFR
protein levels in lung cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and plasmid constructs
Antibodies against EGFR, c-Cbl, ubiquitin (EMD Millipore),
ERK1/2, pY845-EGFR, pY992-EGFR, pY1045-EGFR, pY1068EGFR, pY1173-EGFR, phospho-tyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology), Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), and phospho-ERK1/2 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased from indicated commercial suppliers. Recombinant human EGF was purchased from
Promega Corporation. Lactacystin was purchased from SigmaAldrich. Cetuximab (Erbitux) was from ImClone System Incorporated. Flag-tagged CTEN full-length, N-terminal, C-terminal
plasmids were constructed by PCR ampliﬁcation of the EGFP–
CTEN (13). PCR products were then directionally cloned into
EcoRI and BamHI sites in the vector, pFLAG-CMV-2 (SigmaAldrich). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged c-Cbl mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with the HA-tagged wildtype (WT) c-Cbl.
Cell culture and DNA transfection
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection and authenticated by this established provider
through cytogenetic analysis. They were cultured and used
within 6 months after resuscitation in appropriate media:
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) 4.5 g/L glucose
for HEK 293T, SW480, and A549 cells; RPMI-1640 for 5637
cells; McCoy's 5A medium for HCT116 cells supplemented
with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. All cells were maintained at
37 C in humid air with 5% CO2 condition. For the EGFtreatment experiments, cells were starved in serum-free media
for 24 hours and then replaced with media containing EGF,
prepared freshly from an aqueous 100 mg/mL recombinant
human EGF solution. Transfections were carried out using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR
Total cellular RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the user manual.
cDNAs were generated from 2 mg RNA using the High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Realtime PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were conducted with SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix using PCR primers on an ABI Prism HT7900
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). EGFR prim-

er sequences were as follows: 50 -CGGGACATAGTCAGCAGTG30 (forward) and 50 -GCTGGGCACAGATGATTTTG-30 (reverse).
Relative EGFR mRNA expression was determined by the comparative Ct method using RQ Manager software (Applied
Bioscience).
Coimmunoprecipitation
Cell lysates of each 100-mm dish were prepared in 1 mL NP40 lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
0.1% NP-40, and 1 mmol/L EDTA) supplemented with 1
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied
Science) by gentle pipetting. The cell lysates were then incubated on ice for 20 minutes and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10
minutes at 4 C. The supernatants were collected and precleared with protein A-agarose for 30 minutes at 4 C with
agitation. The precleared aliquots were then immuneprecipitated with M2 Flag afﬁnity beads or speciﬁc antibodies-conjugated agarose for 2 to 4 hours at 4 C with agitation. Beads
were washed three times by using lysis buffer supplemented
with 300 mmol/L NaCl, and pellets were boiled for 5 minutes in
10 mL 2 SDS sample buffer for the analysis.
GST pull-down assays
The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)
domains of CTEN have been previously described (14). GST
fusion proteins, or GST alone, were expressed in Escherichia
coli BL21 strain and afﬁnity-puriﬁed using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. For in vitro pull-down assay, 750
mg of EGF-treated whole-cell extracts in NP-40 lysis buffer from
HEK 293T cells were added to 25 mg of afﬁnity-puriﬁed fusion
proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The bound
proteins were separated by electrophoresis and examined by
immunoblotting. The peptide competition assay was conducted by preincubating the GST fusion proteins, which bound
to the glutathione-Sepharose, with 100 mg of indicated peptides
or phosphopeptides before adding the cell lysates. The peptides
and phosphopeptides were commercially synthesized (GenScript): c-Cbl Y700, CGEEDTEYMTPSSR (700XP), CGEEDTEpYMTPSSR (700P); c-Cbl Y774, CENEDDGpYDVPKPP (774XP),
CENEDDGpYDVPKPP (774P). The purities of all peptides were
more than 80% and their composition were veriﬁed by mass
spectrometry.
Migration, invasion, and colony formation assays
HCT116 cells (5  104 cells) were transfected with EGFPCTEN WT, R474A mutant, or control vector for 4 to 6 hours
before seeding onto the upper chamber of a Transwell (8-mm
pore size; BD Biosciences). The cells in the upper chamber
were maintained in a serum-free medium and the lower
chamber was ﬁlled with culture medium supplemented with
10% FBS. After 24 hours, the nonmigrating cells were removed
from the upper surface of the membrane by scrubbing and the
migrated cells on the lower surface were stained with crystal
violet (0.25% crystal violet, 3.7% formaldehyde, and 80%
methanol) and counted. For Transwell invasion assay, the
transfected cells were seeded onto the upper chamber of a

Transwell. The experimental process is comparable with the
Transwell migration assay described earlier, except that the
membrane of the Transwell was precoated with 2 mg/well
serum-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and invasion was
assessed by cell counting after 48-hour incubation. For colony
formation assay, cells (5  103/well) were seeded in 6-well
plates and subjected to drug selection for 2 to 3 weeks, with
G418 (400 mg/mL) selective medium refreshed every 3 days.
The stable G418-resistant colonies were counted after staining with crystal violet, washed with water, and air-dried. For
EGFR inhibition, 5 mg/mL of cetuximab was added to both
upper and lower chambers in migration and invasion assay. In
colony formation assay, 5 mg/mL of cetuximab was added to

reagents with 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (AEC) as the chromogen (Vector Laboratories Inc.). The samples were observed
using a Zeiss Axioplan2 optical microscope imaging system
with a real-color AxioCam high-resolution charge-coupled
device camera (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Slides were evaluated
and the staining intensity was ranked on a scale ranging from 0
to 3 (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong intensity
staining). The score of staining more than 1 was identiﬁed as
upregulated in CTEN or EGFR expression. Statistical analysis
was conducted using GraphPad Prism (version 5.01, GraphPad
Software Inc.). The statistical relationships between CTEN and
EGFR of immunohistochemical (IHC) data were evaluated
through the two-sided Fisher exact test. P values less than
0.001 were considered statistically highly signiﬁcant.

Microarray analysis
The gene expression datasets were downloaded from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO). We chose four different types of
cancer datasets that have balanced number of disease and
control samples in each dataset. Figure 5 showed the gene
expression datasets that were used in this study, including
breast cancer (GSE15852), colon cancer (GSE10950), non–
small cell lung cancer (GSE12236), and pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (GSE28735). Partek Genomics Suite (Partek
software, version 6.6 Beta) was used to analyze gene expression values and to generate dot plots. Expression differences
between tumor and adjacent normal tissues were assessed by
one-way ANOVA. Statistical analysis was conducted using
Student t test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant. All reported P values are two-tailed.

Results

Immunohistochemistry and evaluation
Human lung cancer (8 small cell carcinomas, 13 adenocarcinomas, 18 squamous cell carcinomas, and 9 other type non–
small cell carcinomas) and adjacent paired tissue microarray
slides were purchased from Pantomics Inc. The formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded tissue slides were ﬁrst incubated at 65 C
for 30 minutes. Then, the samples were deparafﬁnized and
placed in a pressure cooker containing 10 mmol/L buffered
sodium citrate solution (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. The slides
were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. After that, the slides
were blocked before being incubated overnight at 4 C with 1:50
diluted rabbit monoclonal anti-CTEN antibody (Spring Bioscience) or with mouse monoclonal anti-WT EGFR antibody
(DAK-H1-WT from Dako). Detection was carried out on next
day with streptavidin-biotinylated peroxidase-conjugated

CTEN expression modulates EGFR protein levels during
EGF treatment
It has previously been shown that EGF-induced CTEN
upregulation promotes cell migration (6). To further investigate the potential role of CTEN in EGFR signaling and its
regulation mechanism, recombinant CTEN was expressed in
HEK 293T cells, which did not express endogenous CTEN. Then
cells were treated with various concentrations of EGF for 1
hour. As shown in Fig. 1A, EGF-induced EGFR downregulation
was signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of CTEN. At this 1
hour time point, maximal suppression of EGFR downregulation by CTEN was observed at 10 ng/mL EGF treatment.
Consistently, the activation of downstream kinases, such as
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 (measured by
its phosphorylation level), was markedly higher in the presence
of CTEN (Fig. 1A). Time course experiments indicated that the
half-life of EGFR was extended from 45 to 90 minutes in the
presence of EGF when CTEN was overexpressed (Fig. 1B).
Because EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation is an immediate event
upon ligand binding and also represents the activated form of
EGFR, the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR were examined. As shown in Fig. 1C, total tyrosine phosphorylation levels
of EGFR (pEGFR) were signiﬁcantly enhanced in the presence
of CTEN. The increase of pEGFR seemed to be a reﬂection of
EGFR protein level. Once the pEGFR levels were normalized to
total protein levels (tEGFR), there were no differences between
cells with or without CTEN. By using phospho site-speciﬁc
antibodies, higher phospho-Y845 (pY845), pY992, pY1045,
pY1068, and pY1173 levels together with increased EGFR
amounts were detected in CTEN transfectants than in mock
cells (Fig. 1D). Altogether, these results showed that the
presence of CTEN signiﬁcantly diminished EGF-induced EGFR

lysates with anti-EGFR antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Left, representative immunoblot analyses; right, bar
graphs showing the ratios of pEGFR/tEGFR at indicated time points. The intensity of each band was quantiﬁed and shown as a fold change from the 5 minute

downregulation, sustained activated receptor, and therefore
prolonged EGFR signaling.
The effect of CTEN on EGFR protein and mRNA levels was
also examined in colon (SW480), lung (A549), and bladder
(5637) cancer cell lines that overexpress endogenous CTEN.
Both basal and inducible downregulation of EGFR protein
levels were signiﬁcantly enhanced when CTEN expression was
silenced by siRNA (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, EGFR mRNA levels
were not changed after CTEN was silenced in these cell lines
(Fig. 1F), indicating that the effect is independent of transcriptional control.
CTEN reduces ligand-induced ubiquitination of EGFR
and modulates c-Cbl–EGFR interaction
It is known that ubiquitination is a critical step for EGFinduced degradation of EGFR. To examine the effect of CTEN
on EGFR ubiquitination, HEK 293T cells were transfected with
CTEN and then treated with or without EGF. Equal amounts of
EGFR were immunoprecipitated and their ubiquitination
levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 2A, CTEN signiﬁcantly
reduced the ubiquitination of EGFR in the presence of EGF.
This suggests that CTEN protects ligand-induced EGFR degradation through reducing its ubiquitination. c-Cbl is the
primary E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds directly to pY1045 and

indirectly to pY1068 sites of EGFR and then ubiquitinates the
receptor upon ligand stimulation. Hence, the phosphorylation
levels of both sites were examined to test whether CTEN might
compromise c-Cbl–binding sites on EGFR. Equal amounts of
EGFR were immunoprecipitated and their pY1045 and pY1068
levels were measured in a time course experiment (Fig. 2B). In
agreement with our ﬁndings in Fig. 1C, no remarkable phosphorylation difference at these sites between control and
CTEN transfectants was observed. In the same experiment,
the interaction between c-Cbl and EGFR was analyzed. Overall,
increasing amounts of c-Cbl were interacted with EGFR in
control cells, whereas c-Cbl–EGFR interaction levels were
reducing in CTEN transfectants during the time course (Fig.
2B). Nonetheless, signiﬁcant more c-Cbl proteins were bound
to EGFR in the present of CTEN before 15 minutes. After 15
minutes, more c-Cbl–EGFR interaction was detected in the
control cells. These data strongly suggest that CTEN may
regulate the dynamic of c-Cbl–EGFR interaction.

Figure 3. The SH2 domain of CTEN is essential for the interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl. A, the domain structures of CTEN and c-Cbl proteins. cCbl contains an N-terminal TKB region, a RING ﬁnger, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domain. Four tyrosine
phosphorylation residues on c-Cbl are listed. CTEN possesses an SH2 domain and a PTB domain. Mutations of arginine 474 and 650 residues within CTEN
abolish the binding activities of the SH2 and PTB domains, respectively. CTEN N-terminus (Nter) and C-terminus (Cter) fragment mutants are illustrated. B,
coimmunoprecipitation with CTEN fragments. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged CTEN WT, N-terminus (Nter), or C-terminus (Cter)
fragments and then treated with or without 10 ng/mL EGF for 15 minutes. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag antibody and immunoblotted
with anti-c-Cbl antibody. Immunoblot analyses of c-Cbl and Flag-CTEN in total cell lysates are shown. C, same as in B except that Flag-tagged CTEN WT,
SH2 mutant (R474A), and PTB mutant (R650A) were used. D, GST pull-down assay. GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with equal amounts of
lysates from EGF-treated or -untreated HEK 293T cells. Bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with anti–c-Cbl antibody (top right). The
bait proteins were detected by Ponceau-S staining (bottom). E, coimmunoprecipitation of WT and various tyrosine mutants of HA-tagged c-Cbl. HA-c-Cbl WT,
Y674F, Y700F, Y731F, or Y774F were cotransfected with Flag-CTEN into HEK 293T cells. Lysates from untreated cells or cells treated for 15 minutes
with 10 ng/mL of EGF were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Immunoblot analyses of HA-c-Cbl and FlagCTEN in total cell lysate are shown. F, phosphopeptide competition assay. GST or GST–SH2 CTEN proteins were preincubated with c-Cbl phosphopeptides
(700P, 774P) or nonphosphorylated peptides (700XP, 774XP) for 30 minutes. Lysates from EGF-stimulated (10 ng/mL, 15 minutes) HEK 293T cells were
added and the incubation continued for another 90 minutes. GST or GST–SH2 bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identiﬁed by immunoblotting

associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag
antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, c-Cbl was coimmunoprecipitated
with Flag-tagged full-length CTEN and this interaction was
markedly enhanced by EGF treatment, suggesting that the
c-Cbl–CTEN interaction might be phosphorylation-dependent.
Interestingly, the interaction was retained when the full-length
CTEN was replaced with its C-terminal fragment (residues 438–
715), but was almost abolished when the N-terminal region
(1–438) of CTEN was used (Fig. 3B). The C-terminal region of
CTEN contains two functional domains, the SH2 and PTB
domains. We used CTEN loss-of-function mutations (R474A
for the SH2 domain and R650A for the PTB domain) to identify
the c-Cbl–binding domain. As shown in Fig. 3C, SH2 mutant
(R474A) of CTEN clearly lost the ability to interact with c-Cbl,
whereas PTB mutant (R650A) sustained the binding to c-Cbl
after EGF induction (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the
SH2 domain of CTEN is essential for ligand-induced binding to
c-Cbl. We further conﬁrmed the interaction between the CTEN
SH2 domain and c-Cbl using a GST fusion pull-down assay. GST,
GST–SH2, and GST–PTB fusion proteins were expressed in
and puriﬁed from E. coli. The fusion proteins were incubated
with cell lysates from EGF-treated or -untreated HEK 293T
cells, and the pull-down assay was conducted as described in
Materials and Methods. Indeed, CTEN GST–SH2, but not GST
or GST–PTB, fusion proteins were able to pull down c-Cbl
(Fig. 3D), suggesting that the SH2 domain of CTEN binds to
tyrosine phosphorylated c-Cbl.
c-Cbl is a prominent substrate of EGFR tyrosine kinase
and tyrosine 674 (AIY674SLAAR), 700 (JEY700MTPS), 731
(CTY731EAMY), and 774 (DGY774DVPK) residues are four major
phosphorylation sites (15–17). To identify the potential phosphorylation-dependent binding sites on c-Cbl, we individually
mutated tyrosine 674, 700, 731, and 774 to phenylalanine and
examined their CTEN-binding activities. c-Cbl Y774F mutant
seemed to lose binding to CTEN after ligand stimulation (Fig.
3E), indicating that tyrosine 774 of c-Cbl could be a crucial
residue for EGF-induced phosphorylaiton-dependent interaction with CTEN. To verify the role of Y774 residue in CTEN
binding, synthetic peptides containing the Y700 or Y774 sites
with or without phosphorylation were used to compete with
c-Cbl binding to GST–SH2 (Fig. 3F). Only phosphorylated
Y774 peptide (774P) was able to block the interaction between
CTEN and c-Cbl, further conﬁrming that Y774 of c-Cbl is a
speciﬁc phosphotyrosine residue for binding to SH2 domain of
CTEN.
A functional SH2 domain of CTEN is essential for
reducing EGF-induced EGFR ubiquitination/
degradation and promoting CTEN-mediated
tumorigenicity
Our results showing c-Cbl–CTEN interaction suggest that
the effect of CTEN on EGF-induced EGFR downregulation may
depend on CTEN SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated
Y774 on c-Cbl. To test this possibility, EGFR ubiquitination
in the presence of CTEN SH2 mutant (R474A) was analyzed. As
shown in Fig. 2A, R474A no longer exhibits the potential to
reduce the ubiquitination of activated EGFR. We further
examined the effect of CTEN R474A on EGFR protein and

5272

ERK1/2 activation levels in the presence of EGF. Downregulation of EGFR in response to EGF was reduced in CTENtransfected HEK 293T cells when compared with those of
experimental groups that transfected with control vector and
R474A mutant (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the diminished downregulation of EGFR, phosphorylation of the EGFR effector
ERK1/2 in response to EGF was markedly increased in the
presence of WT CTEN, but not R474A mutant (Fig. 4A). These
results show that the effect of CTEN on EGF-induced EGFR
ubiquitination, degradation, and signaling is primarily mediated through the CTEN SH2 domain.
Accumulating reports have indicated that CTEN overexpression may be correlated to various types of cancer development
(8, 10, 18, 19). Our results show that the interaction between the
SH2 domain of CTEN and pY774 c-Cbl is important in attenuating EGFR degradation and prolonging EGFR signaling,
which might play important roles in tumor progression. Thus,
we set up a series of experiments to examine the potential role
of CTEN SH2 domain in tumorigenic properties. Ectopic
expression of CTEN in HCT116 (low CTEN) colon cancer cells
signiﬁcantly promoted cell migration, invasion, and colony
formation activities (Fig. 4C–E). In contrast, no enhancement
effects on these activities were observed in cells transfected
with CTEN SH2 mutant (R474A), showing the essential role of
the SH2 domain on CTEN-mediated tumorigenicity in cancer
cells. To further validate the involvement of EGFR signaling in
these CTEN-mediated phenotypes, the experiments were
repeated in the presence of cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody.
Although cetuximab had no effect on HCT116 cell migration
and invasion, it suppressed HCT116 colony formation activity
(Fig. 4C–E). More importantly, the effects of CTEN overexpression were reversed by cetuximab, implicating a direct link
between CTEN and EGFR signaling in these processes.
CTEN mRNA levels are upregulated in a variety of cancers
and its protein expression is correlated with that of EGFR
in human lung samples
Several lines of evidence have indicated that CTEN mRNA
expression is upregulated in various cancers (8, 10, 18, 19). To
extend these ﬁndings, we took advantages of four microarray
datasets available from GEO and analyzed CTEN and EGFR
expression proﬁles using the Partek Genomics Suite software.
Compared with paired normal tissues, we found that CTEN
mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly upregulated in tumors from
breast (GSE15852; ref. 20), colon (GSE10950; ref. 21), lung
(GSE12236; ref. 22), and pancreas (GSE28735; Fig. 5; ref. 23).
Nonetheless, EGFR mRNA levels were downregulated with
statistical signiﬁcance in breast cancer, but not in colon, lung,
and pancreas datasets. These results show that CTEN transcript
was increased, but not correlated with EGFR mRNA levels in
these cancers. Because our cell culture studies suggested that
CTEN expression altered EGFR protein but not mRNA levels, we
analyzed the relationship between CTEN and EGFR protein
levels by IHC staining in normal and lung cancer consecutive
tissue section samples. To rule out the possibility that truncated
variants of EGFR such as EGFR-vIII may escape from ligandinduced downregulation, we limited our analysis to WT EGFR in
these samples by using an anti-WT EGFR antibody (DAK-H1-

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that CTEN expression is
induced by EGF treatment in a variety of normal and cancer
cells, including MCF10A, RWPE-1, HeLa, and SW480 cells
(6, 24). Upregulated CTEN disrupts the interactions between
integrin receptors and actin cytoskeleton (6) and promotes
cancer cell migration, invasion, and colony formation
(6, 8, 9, 11, 24). In this report, we have identiﬁed a novel
function of CTEN in negatively regulating c-Cbl–mediated
EGFR degradation. By binding to activated c-Cbl, CTEN is
able to decrease EGFR ubiquitination and degradation. At this

CTEN and EGFR. In a total of 96 cases, CTEN and EGFR are
upregulated in 50 (52.1%) and 53 (55.2%) samples, respectively
(Fig. 6B). Among them, 39 (40.6%) samples show both elevated
CTEN and EGFR IHC staining, whereas 32 (33.3%) samples
display no change or downregulation on CTEN and EGFR
together (Fig. 6B). The statistical analyses indicate a strongly
positive correlation between CTEN and EGFR protein levels in
these lung samples, supporting the cell culture ﬁnding that
CTEN upregulation increases EGFR protein level.

point, we do not know exactly how c-Cbl–CTEN interaction
leads to the reduction of EGFR ubiquitination. It is possible
that, by binding to c-Cbl, either CTEN sequesters c-Cbl away
from activated EGFR or/and reduces its E3 ligase activity. The
former seems to be supported by our results showing that cCbl–EGFR interaction was markedly reduced in the presence
of CTEN after 15-minute EGF treatment. Because c-Cbl–CTEN
interaction depends on c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation, which
is relied on its binding to activated EGFR, this may explain the
delay disruption of c-Cbl–EGFR interaction by CTEN. Nonetheless, CTEN could somehow transiently (15 minutes) but
robustly enhance c-Cbl–EGFR interaction. How CTEN can
accomplish these dynamic processes remains to be investigated. The function of c-Cbl in promoting EGFR degradation is
known to be suppressed in several ways (25), including (i)
dephosphorylation of crucial phosphotyrosine sites on c-Cbl by
SH2-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP1), (ii) targeting of c-Cbl
for degradation by the E3 ligase atrophin-1–interacting protein-4 (AIP4), (iii) binding of c-Cbl to Sprouty 1/2 pTyr 55 sites
that compete with the pTyr 1045 site on EGFR, and (iv) the
formation of a complex between c-Cbl and PAK-interacting
exchange factor (bPIX), PAK1 and Cdc42. Our study presents a

novel mechanism in modulating EGFR protein levels and
provides additional layer of feedback control in EGFR signaling. In addition to EGFR, c-Cbl contributes to ubiquitination
and downregulation of receptors for platelet-derived growth
factor, VEGF, ﬁbroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth
factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1, neutrophin,
and insulin, as well as members of non–receptor tyrosine
kinase Src family (26). It will be interesting to examine whether
CTEN may regulate the stabilities of these proteins through
binding to c-Cbl.
We have shown that a functional SH2 domain is essential for
CTEN's role in promoting cancer cell migration, invasion, as

5274

well as colony formation, and that CTEN SH2 domain binds to
c-Cbl and prolongs EGFR signaling. These results indicate that
the prolonged EGFR signaling is responsible for transformation properties, which is supported by the fact that EGFR
inhibitor could reverse CTEN-mediated phenotypes. Moreover, SH2 domains of tensin members also interact with
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p130Cas, focal adhesion
kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), and
downstream of tyrosine kinase 2 (Dok-2; refs. 27–29). These
binding partners may all contribute to CTEN-enhanced cancer
phenotypes. On the other hand, SH2 domains of CTEN and
tensins bind to the tumor suppressor DLC1 (deleted in liver

cancer 1) in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner, which is
required for DLC1's tumor suppression activity (14). The
function of recruiting DLC1 to focal adhesion for preventing
cell transformation seems contradictory to the phenotypes
observed in Fig. 4. One likely reason is that DLC1 is downregulated or absence in many cancer cell lines including
HCT116 cells used in this study. Nonetheless, these ﬁndings
also implicate the complexities of CTEN regulatory networks in
normal cells.
Upregulation and aberrant activation of EGFR are highly
associated with tumor progression as well as therapeutic
resistance in human patients with cancer (30, 31). EGFRtargeted therapies are used to treat several types of cancers

www.aacrjournals.org

including colorectal, breast, and lung cancer. Although
showing promising effects in some patients, many other
patients still suffer from side effects and resistance associated with anti-EGFR agents. The reasons that underline
the anti-EGFR resistance have not yet been clariﬁed, but
may be related to much higher EGFR levels/activities
and RAS/RAF mutations in some patients (32). Considering
that CTEN (i) regulates activated EGFR levels, (ii) is a
downstream of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway, (iii) plays roles
in tumor migration/invasion, and (iv) is expressed at very
low levels in most normal tissues, targeting CTEN along
with EGFR might be a more efﬁcient approach for cancer
therapies.
