BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most lethal type of brain tumor, has a 1-year median
survival. The effect of carmustine wafers on the survival of newly diagnosed GBM patients treated with
radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) plus RT plus rotational chemotherapy was investigated. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective study was conducted in 85 newly
diagnosed GBM patients who received surgical resection with and without carmustine wafers followed by
RT and concurrent TMZ plus rotational chemotherapy. Treatment group comparisons were conducted using
the log-rank test. Survival experience of the Duke cohort was examined within specific patient subgroups
defined by the original Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partition analysis (RPA) class
and compared with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (Stupp) and RTOG
trial. RESULTS: Overall 1- and 2-year survival for the noncarmustine wafer cohort were 69% and 29%,
respectively, with a median survival of 72.7 weeks. One- and 2-year survival for the carmustine wafer cohort
were 81% and 47%, with median survival of 89.5 weeks. Carmustine wafer was not an independent predictor
(P ¼.110) of survival after adjustment for RPA class. The proportion of patients in the carmustine wafer
cohort who lived longer than predicted based upon Stupp regimen results was significantly greater than
0.5 (P<.006); similar results based upon the RTOG trial data were observed (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:
Carmustine wafer with concurrent TMZ and radiation followed by rotational chemotherapy is a well tolerated, effective therapy, and has a survival benefit compared with radiation alone. Prospective randomized
trials are needed to rigorously compare the carmustine wafer regimen to the Stupp and postradiation

survival rate for GBM patients has not significantly
changed, despite >25 years of research involving a variety
of agents and delivery systems. Standard approach to therapy had consisted of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in primary
glioma treatment has until recently been more controversial. A meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials comparing
additional adjuvant chemotherapy to radiation alone
demonstrated only a 5% increase (from 15% to 20%) in
the 2-year survival rate.1 Thus, the general consensus in
2002 was that the use of chemotherapy after surgery and
radiotherapy produced a marginal benefit over that seen
with surgery and radiotherapy alone.
More recently, 2 large randomized clinical trials
have demonstrated the independent efficacy of temozolomide and carmustine wafer in newly diagnosed malignant
glioma patients, which led to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of these agents for the treatment of
malignant glioma.
Stupp et al reported the results of a multi-institutional phase 3 European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer trial in which patients with newly
diagnosed GBM were randomized after surgery to receive
either radiation alone or radiation with concurrent temozolomide followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide.
The 2-year survival was significantly higher (26.4%) for
patients receiving radiation and adjuvant temozolomide
than for patients receiving radiation therapy alone
(10.4%).2 Westphal et al randomized patients with newly
diagnosed malignant glioma to surgery with placement of
carmustine wafers (polifeprosan 20 with carmustine
implant) or a placebo wafer.3 All patients subsequently
received radiotherapy. The results demonstrated a survival
advantage favoring the use of carmustine wafers, and the
FDA extended a prior indication for recurrent malignant
glioma to include newly diagnosed malignant glioma.
However, after surgical resection and radiation therapy,
neither carmustine wafers alone nor single-agent temozolomide can effectively treat malignant gliomas.
Recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network 2008 Practice Guidelines in Oncology recommended the combination of carmustine wafers followed
by radiation with concurrent adjuvant temozolomide for
the treatment of primary malignant gliomas. However,
there are no published randomized trials demonstrating
its effectiveness or toxicity as a combination regimen.
3502

Unfortunately, increases in survival produced by either of
these agents when used alone or with radiotherapy are
modest, and the overall outcome for GBM patients
remains dismal, with a medial survival of 12 weeks after
recurrence. Although drug delivery may limit the intracerebral delivery of chemotherapies, the major cause of
treatment failure is primary tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Resistance is predictable, given the marked heterogeneity of cancer cells within and between individual
tumors, making it highly unlikely that single-agent chemotherapy alone will produce dramatic results in most settings. With only rare exceptions, such as imatinib for
chronic myelogenous leukemia,4 monotherapy has shown
little success in the treatment of human malignancy as
compared with multiagent therapy. Thus, effective adjuvant treatment for malignant gliomas must include a
multimodality approach, involving surgery and local
treatment (with or without carmustine wafers) followed
by radiation therapy and a combination of antineoplastic
agents and possibly targeted molecular therapies.
To prevent tumor resistance from developing
through multiple adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents with
differing antitumor mechanisms, Duke treats primary
glioblastoma patients with a standard regimen consisting
of radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide followed by adjuvant multiagent rotational chemotherapy
(consisting of temozolomide, lomustine, and irinotecan)
for a full year (Fig. 1). We have previously demonstrated
that adjuvant rotational multiagent chemotherapy was an
effective regimen when compared with patients receiving
single-agent adjuvant regimens after radiation and concurrent temozolomide.5
We are interested in determining if there is a survival
advantage for patients with newly diagnosed malignant
glioma who are treated with the addition of carmustine
wafer implantation followed by concurrent radiotherapy
and temozolomide plus 1 year of multiagent adjuvant
rotational chemotherapy. We hypothesize that the addition of carmustine wafers followed by radiation and
concurrent temozolomide plus rotational multiagent
chemotherapy (temozolomide, carmustine, irinotecan)
would increase survival compared with: 1) patients who
did not receive carmustine wafers, 2) patients who
received the standard Stupp regimen, and 3) patients who
received surgery followed by radiation alone (Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] trial). Thus, we

conducted a retrospective data analysis of 85 patients to
determine the overall survival rate of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients who were diagnosed between the years
2000 and 2005 by surgical resection (with or without carmustine wafer) and who also received radiation therapy and
concurrent temozolomide followed by a full year of adjuvant multiagent rotational chemotherapy. Outcomes for
both analyses included 1) overall survival and 2) toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Research Activities
A retrospective chart review was performed on 176
patients’ charts to determine which patients were eligible
for the retrospective study covering the years 2000-2005
(Fig. 2). Retrospective analyses have many limitations,
because of the lack of control over the sampling of the
populations and the quality of the predictor and outcome
variables. Existing data (especially tissue diagnoses, which
were not all verified by an independent and secondary pathology review) may be inaccurate, incomplete, or measured in ways not ideal to answer the question. However,
most prognostic variables chosen for this project are collected at a rate of 90% in the Duke Brain Tumor Center.
Furthermore, the hard outcome of survival is easily
obtained through our survival and social security databases. Follow-up may be difficult in some cases and may

be a limitation. Selection biases may also be a concern.
Most newly diagnosed patients between 2000 and 2004
were not receiving concurrent temozolomide and radiation as standard of care; thus, the patients who received
this regimen may not be representative of the true population. Despite primary limitations of this historical data
analysis, the recursive partition analysis (RPA) model has
been incorporated into this study to address limitation of
the potential biases (overt and hidden) and differences
between the Duke and Stupp cohorts in their case mix. As
described in the statistical section, the RPA model has
recently and frequently been used to address this issue in
other brain tumor trials. In addition, statistical methods
to adjust for the overt prognostic differences not addressed
by the RPA (eg, complete resection) between cohorts analysis were performed.
Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were: 1) histologically confirmed
diagnosis of primary glioblastoma multiforme, 2) chemotherapy naive before resection or radiation, 3) underwent
a gross total or partial resection with or without carmustine wafer placement, and 4) scheduled to receive radiotherapy (for a planned total of 60 grays [Gy]) and
concomitant temozolomide therapy followed by rotational chemotherapy (Fig. 1).
Exclusion criteria

Exclusion criteria were: 1) patient underwent biopsy
alone, and 2) received monoclonal therapy or 3) upfront
chemotherapy. During the study period evaluation
3503

Original Article

(2000-2005), temozolomide and concurrent temozolomide were not standard of care until the seminal Stupp et
al article was published in March 2005. Thus, of the 176
patients who had newly diagnosed GBM, 97 received
radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide followed
by rotational chemotherapy with temozolomide, carmustine, and irinotecan. Eight patients were enrolled from
2005, when the Stupp regimen became standard of care.
Eligible patients for the carmustine wafer cohort included
patients who underwent a near complete resection. Only
patients who underwent resection could receive carmustine wafer, and thus patients who underwent biopsy alone
were not eligible for the retrospective chart review. Of the
97 eligible patients, 12 were excluded from the analysis; 6
patients who received liquid brachytherapy and 6 patients
for other reasons (received upfront chemotherapy, uncertain if they received radiation). A final cohort of 85
patients who had a newly diagnosed GBM diagnosed only
by surgical resection was included in the analysis. At the
time of primary surgery, 49 did not receive carmustine
wafer implantation, compared with 36 who did receive
carmustine wafers. After radiation and concurrent temozolomide, all patients received the Duke standard newly
diagnosed GBM treatment as outlined below (Fig. 1). All
patients for whom there was intent to treat with rotational
chemotherapy had data collected as outlined below.
Retrospective Chart Review
The following items were abstracted retrospectively from
patient medical charts: hospital number, date of birth,
race, sex, diagnosis, date of diagnosis, resection (with
or without nitrosourea wafers) versus biopsy, surgical
pathology number, tumor, Karnofsky performance status
(KPS), radiation type, radiation dose, radiation with/
without concurrent temozolomide, type of chemotherapy, number of treatment cycles, and date of death or
last follow-up. Charts were further reviewed for toxicity.
Decadron was administered according to standard of
care practice in the perioperative setting and then tapered
as tolerated postoperatively.
Analysis
The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to
compare the survival and toxicity experience of 2 patient
cohorts treated at Duke: patients who received adjuvant
3504

rotational chemotherapy after surgical implantation of
carmustine wafers and patients who received similar rotational therapy after surgery without implantation. The
product limit estimator was used to describe the survival
experience of both Duke cohorts (with vs without carmustine wafer). Estimates of 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival and
median survival were generated within each cohort.
Within each cohort, patients were classified into subgroups with homogeneous prognosis using the RTOG
RPA class.6,7 Performance status, age, mental status, neurological function, radiation dose, and extent of surgery
define these RPA classes. Descriptive Kaplan-Meier estimates were generated within patient subgroups defined by
the usage of carmustine wafers and RPA class. A log-rank
test was used to assess the individual effect of carmustine
usage, RPA class, race, and sex on survival. Given the retrospective nature of this study, a comparison of cohort survival
requires adjustment for presurgical differences in cohort
patient characteristics. The Cox proportional hazards model
was used to compare the survival of patients treated with
and without carmustine wafer adjusted for RPA class. The
small number of patient events necessitates the need to minimize the number of predictors in the Cox model to retain
validity. For that reason, RPA class was included in this
model to adjust for performance status, age, extent of surgery, and mental status. An interaction between RPA class
and wafer usage was also included in the Cox model.
An attempt was made to compare the survival experience observed within the Duke carmustine cohort to that
reported by Stupp and the RTOG. By using estimates of
median survival provided by the Stupp and RTOG trials
within RPA class (3-4), the proportion of patients living
longer than expected within the Duke cohorts was computed. A single-sample binomial test was used to determine
whether that proportion was >0.5. The Cochran Armitage
test for trend was use to examine the relationship between
RPA class (3-4) and this proportion. Comparison with the
Stupp regimen is difficult because of unbalanced baseline
characteristics, a limitation of this retrospective analysis.
Specifically, there was a higher fraction of patients achieving
a complete resection in the carmustine wafer cohort (69%)
compared with the Stupp cohort (39%). In an attempt to
address this limitation, we conducted an analysis to determine whether complete resection had an impact on the proportion of patients who lived longer than expected based on
the results of the Stupp cohort given the disparity in the

The number of carmustine wafers implanted is determined by the size of the cavity and ranged from 1 to 8
wafers in the carmustine wafer cohort. The radiotherapy
consisted of conventional doses of 180-200 cGy daily for 6
weeks. No patients were prophylactically treated for Pneumocystis carinii. Within the noncarmustine wafer cohort,
39% of patients were younger than 50 years, and 89% had

were younger than 50, and 94% had KPS 70.

and 2-year survival in the carmustine wafer cohort was
greater than that observed in the noncarmustine cohort
(carmustine: 81% and 49%; noncarmustine: 69% and
29%). Similarly, the median survival in the carmustine
group (89.5 weeks) was greater than that observed in the
noncarmustine group (72.7 weeks). There was no difference in the point estimates in 3-year survival for the
noncarmustine wafer and the carmustine wafer cohorts,
which were 20% and 21%, respectively.
Descriptive statistics for the survival within patient
subgroups defined by carmustine usage and RPA class are
provided in Table 3, along with comparable statistics
reported within the Stupp and RTOG studies. Figure 4
displays the survival experience of patient subgroups.
The log-rank test was used to assess the relationship
between survival and each of the following predictors: carmustine wafer usage, RPA class, race, and sex (Table 4).
These analyses demonstrated RPA to be a significant predictor of survival (P < .001). The joint effect of RPA class,
3506

an indicator of carmustine wafer use, and its interaction
on survival was examined within the context of the Cox
proportional hazards model. The likelihood ratio test for
interaction was not statistically significant (P ¼ .086). A
main effect model with factors describing RPA class and
carmustine usage was fit to the data. Only RPA effect was
highly significant. As described in Table 4, the likelihood
ratio test for carmustine impregnated after adjustment for
RPA class was not statistically significant (P ¼ .110). As
stated previously, we were also concerned about the effect
of complete resection on the survival outcome. Although
RPA analysis classifies patients based on extent of surgical
procedure, it only differentiates between biopsy and resection, not degree of resection (complete vs partial resection). Because there was such a disparity in the percentage
of complete resection between the carmustine wafer
cohort (69%) and the Stupp cohort (39%), we deemed it
necessary to determine the impact of this specific prognostic factor (complete resection) on survival (Table 4). The
median survival within the Duke complete resection subgroup was 76.3 weeks, as compared with the reported
81.5 weeks in the Stupp Cohort. Among patients with
complete resection, the proportion of patients who lived
significantly longer than expected is not significantly different from 0.5 (P ¼ .346). Thus, there was no difference
in median survival between the Stupp and Duke cohorts
in patients who had a complete resection.
The median survival reported for the Stupp and
RTOG trials within RPA classes was used to assess the survival experience of patients treated with carmustine and
rotational chemotherapy (Table 5). In both cases, >70%
of patients treated within the Duke carmustine cohort
lived longer than expected according to statistics provided
from the Stupp and RTOG trials (P ¼ .001 and
P ¼ .006).

In comparing the Duke carmustine wafer cohort experience to RTOG and Stupp, we limited the analysis to
RPA Class 3-4. By using estimates of median survival provided by the Stupp and RTOG trials within each RPA
class, the proportion of patients living longer than
expected within the Duke cohort was assessed, tested, and

compared with the Stupp and RTOG trial. If the Duke
carmustine wafer cohort regimen had a comparable outcome to Stupp or RTOG, then on average half should live
longer than the reported median, and half should live a
shorter period of time. The Cochran-Armitage Trend
Test demonstrated that the proportion of patients within
the Duke carmustine wafer cohort (RPA Class 4-5) lived
longer compared with the Stupp and RTOG (radiation
alone) regimen (P value in both situations is .018).

with and without carmustine wafer implantation. Both
treatment regimens are well tolerated in comparison to
the recently published ‘‘gold’’ standard adjuvant regimen.
Comparison of the different regimen toxicities is difficult
due to case mix; however, those toxicities reported for
carmustine wafers or Stupp regimen reveal a similar toxicity profile. La Rocca did report more toxicity related to
thrombosis, fatigue, and toxicity; however, the data are
preliminary and ongoing.8 The incidence of the toxicities
demonstrated in the La Rocca trial might decrease as the
sample size and study power increase. Adverse events in
GBM patients who did not receive carmustine-impregnated wafer implantation but received radiation with
concurrent temozolomide followed by multiagent
chemotherapy included (16%) grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity consisting of 8% (4 of 49) grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and 8% (4 of 49) grade 3-4 leukopenia.
One (2%) patient demonstrated grade 4 pulmonary
emboli. Four (8%) patients experienced grade 3-4
thromboses. Thirteen (27%) patients experienced grade
2-4 fatigue. Four (8%) patients experienced grade 2-4
infections. Four (8%) patients demonstrated grade 3-4
seizures during the entire study period. Four (8%)
patients experienced grade 2 hemorrhages. No patient
demonstrated symptomatic cerebral edema.
Toxicities in GBM patients who received carmustine wafers and subsequent radiation with concurrent
temozolomide followed by multiagent chemotherapy
had higher (31%) grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity,
consisting of 17% (6 of 36) grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia
and 14% (5 of 36) grade 3-4 leukopenia. Three (8%)
patients in this cohort experienced grade 2-4 anemia.
One (3%) patient demonstrated grade 4 pulmonary
emboli. Three (8%) patients experienced grade 3-4
thromboses. Five (14%) patients experienced grade 2-4
fatigue. Four (11%) patients experienced grade 2-4 infections. Four (11%) patients demonstrated grade 3-4 seizures during the entire study period. No patient
experienced a grade 2 hemorrhage. One (3%) patient
experienced a pseudomeningocele.

DISCUSSION
The evaluation of the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of malignant glioma has not produced impressive
results to date. The FDA has approved only 3 agents for

treatment of newly diagnosed malignant glioma over the
past 30 years: carmustine wafers,2 temozolomide, and most
recently, bevacizumab.3 Unfortunately, the vast majority of
patients treated with available agent die of progressive tumor. New approaches will have to recognize the fallacy
that single-agent chemotherapy will produce a significant
increase in survival except perhaps in subsets of patients
with very specific molecular profiles. Examples of this may
include low O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase9-15 or
epidermal growth factor receptor VIII with wild-type
PTEN.16 Accordingly, new strategies for patients with
newly diagnosed malignant glioma will need to address
identification of new agents, and targeting novel tumor
molecular pathways,17 as well as combinations of agents
with proven activity. This latter approach is the hallmark
of strategies used where chemotherapy is particularly successful, including childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia,
Wilms tumor, Hodgkin disease, and germ cell tumors.
The combination of carmustine wafers and temozolomide is especially intriguing, because temozolomide has
been demonstrated to deplete methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), the DNA repair enzyme responsible for
carmustine resistance. Preclinical studies have suggested
that the synergistic effect of the combination of both carmustine and temozolomide may be in part related to
depletion of MGMT. However, a study combining intravenous carmustine and temozolomide for malignant solid
tumors has been associated with significant hematological
toxicity, with a maximum tolerated dose of 110 mg/m2/d.
Raizer et al concluded that the treatment of 80 malignant
gliomas with intravenous carmustine and low-dose temozolomide (80 mg/m2/d) was not feasible for prolonged
therapy because of myelosupression.18 Gururangan et al
demonstrated in a phase 1 study that dual therapy with
carmustine wafers and temozolomide (dose range: 100,
150, 200 mg/m2  5 days) was well tolerated, with no
new or unexpected toxicities.19 Although this study demonstrated that temozolomide could be safely administered
with carmustine wafers, and 2 patients in this trial completed 12 months of temozolomide treatment without
progressive disease, it was a very small, 10-patient, noncomparative study and did not evaluate overall survival as
a study endpoint. Preliminary data from a phase 2 multicentered trial consisting of 34 primary malignant glioma
patients who received carmustine wafer implantation followed by radiation and concurrent temozolomide (75 mg/

m2/d, 7 days/wk) followed by 6 monthly standard temozolomide (200 mg/m2/d  5 days every 28 days 18
cycles) had a 1-year overall survival and progression-free
survival of 64% and 29%, respectively. The most frequently reported adverse advents were nausea, constipation, and fatigue. Severe grade 3 and 4 toxicities include
venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary
embolism. One patient experienced Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia, and 1 patient experienced a brain abscess.8
We have subsequently conducted a retrospective
analysis to examine the efficacy of treatment with surgery, with or without carmustine wafer placement, followed by radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide
and rotational chemotherapy in patients with newly
diagnosed malignant glioma. Although not statistically
significant, these data suggest that the inclusion of carmustine wafers in a treatment regimen involving rotational chemotherapy may be of benefit. The small
sample size and hence low power may have contributed
to the lack of statistical significance. Given the limitations of this retrospective analysis, we have also shown
that carmustine wafers followed by this multimodal regimen are tolerable, as there was no increase in toxicity
in excess of that reported with either carmustine wafers
or temozolomide alone.
Furthermore, carmustine wafers followed by this
multimodal regimen improve the number of patients who
survive longer than radiation alone, and are an effective
and tolerable regimen. Although this single-center retrospective analysis has multiple limitations, we have made
an effort to address the limitations by adjusting for RPA
class. These results support the feasibility, tolerability, and
activity of carmustine wafers followed by radiation and
concurrent temozolomide plus rotational multiagent
chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. Future multicenter, prospective, phase 3
randomized trials should be conducted to confirm the
efficacy and effectiveness of combining temozolomide
with carmustine wafers.
