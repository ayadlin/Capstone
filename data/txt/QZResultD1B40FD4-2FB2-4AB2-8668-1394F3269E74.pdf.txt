BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinomas of the appendix represent a heterogeneous disease depending on the presence of mucinous histology, histologic grade, and stage. In the current study, the authors sought to explore the interplay of these factors with systemic
chemotherapy in a large population data set. METHODS: Patients in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) who were diagnosed
with mucinous, nonmucinous, and signet ring cell-type appendiceal neoplasms from 1985 through 2006 were selected. Multivariable
Cox proportional hazards regression models were developed. RESULTS: A total of 11,871 patients met the inclusion criteria for the current study: 50.3% had mucinous neoplasms, 40.5% had nonmucinous neoplasms, and 9.2% had signet ring cell-type neoplasms. The
5-year overall survival (OS) stratified by grade was similar among patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to stage
III disease but not for those with stage IV disease. The median OS for patients with stage IV mucinous and nonmucinous tumors was
6.4 years and 2.3 years, respectively, for those with well differentiated histology (P<.0001) and was 1.5 years and 0.8 years, respectively, for those with poorly differentiated histology (P<.0001). In multivariable modeling for stage I to III disease, adjuvant chemotherapy improved OS for both mucinous and nonmucinous histologies, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.68-0.89 [P 5.0002]) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.94 [P 5.002]), respectively. For patients with stage IV disease, systemic
chemotherapy significantly improved OS for those with nonmucinous (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.82 [P<.0001]) but not mucinous (HR,
0.95; 95% CI, 0.86-1.04 [P 5.2) histologies, although this was grade-dependent. The median OS for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was 6.4 years versus 6.5 years (P value not significant) for patients with mucinous, well-differentiated tumors and 1.6 years
versus 1.0 years (P 5.0007) for patients with mucinous, poorly differentiated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated a significant OS benefit regardless of histology. However, for patients with stage IV disease, the benefit of systemic chemotherapy varied by tumor histology and grade, with patients with well-differentiated, mucinous, appendiceal adenocarcinomas deriving

INTRODUCTION
Adenocarcinomas of the appendix are histologically sorted into mucinous, nonmucinous, and signet ring cell types.1,2 The
seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system separated appendiceal adenocarcinomas
from colorectal adenocarcinomas and incorporated grade into the staging of stage IV disease.3 The current AJCC staging system for appendiceal adenocarcinomas classifies mucinous tumors into low-grade (well-differentiated) and high-grade (moderately and poorly differentiated) adenocarcinomas.3 This distinction is required for the classification of stage IV appendiceal
adenocarcinomas as low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma with peritoneal-only involvement are classified as stage IVA.
Given the rarity of appendiceal neoplasms, the majority of the existing reports in the literature are classified as singleinstitution retrospective studies and hence have been limited by small sample size and selection bias.4-7 Prior reports have
demonstrated the prognostic impact of histological grade for appendiceal adenocarcinomas with mucinous histology.8,9

Original Article

In a recent analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) data, 2469 appendiceal adenocarcinomas were analyzed and the prognostic impact of histologic grade for mucinous tumors was found to be limited
to stage IV disease.8 In addition, a significant difference in
cancer-specific survival (CSS) between patients with moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated mucinous
appendiceal adenocarcinomas was noted.8 However, this
analysis was limited by sample size and the lack of any
treatment-related data. In addition, to the best of our
knowledge, the role of systemic chemotherapy in treating
patients with adenocarcinoma of the appendix has not
been assessed in any large national registry.
Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to
use the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), which is a
nationwide cancer database that captures approximately
70% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the United States,
to: 1) assess the impact of histologic grade on overall survival (OS) for patients with mucinous and nonmucinous
appendiceal neoplasms; and 2) to assess the impact of systemic chemotherapy on OS.

Study Design

We performed retrospective analyses of a cohort of
patients diagnosed with appendiceal cancer from 1985 to
2006. The end date of follow-up was December 2011.
Data Source and Study Population

The source of data for this study was the NCDB. The
NCDB is a nationwide cancer database sponsored by the
Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. Data capture
from patients’ medical records is performed by trained
cancer registrars.
Only patients with topography code C18.1 of the
third edition of the International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology were eligible. The second and third edition
histology codes selected were: mucinous (8470, 8480, and
8481), nonmucinous (8010, 8013, 8020, 8140, 8141,
8144, 8210, 8211, 8255, 8260, 8261, 8262, 8263, 8310,
8440, 8460, 8471, 8472, 8560, and 8574), and signet
ring cell (8490). Excluded from further analysis were
patients aged <18 years or > 90 years, those with
unknown tumor stage, those with unknown treatment
status, or those diagnosed at autopsy (Fig. 1).
The variables of interest were age of the patient
at the time of diagnosis, sex, grade (well-differentiated,
moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, undifferentiated/
214

anaplastic, and unknown), systemic chemotherapy status,
type of surgical resection, stage of disease according to the
seventh edition of the AJCC, and vital status. Stage was
derived from the individual combinations of T, N, and M
and only broad staging categories (stage I, II, III, and IV)
could be derived because the seventh edition data components T4a, T4b, M1a, and M1b were not available to
allow for stage subcategories. Details regarding the type of
chemotherapy administered were not available. The types
of surgical resection were: 1) local destruction or excision;
2) partial colectomy/segmental resection with or without
resection of contiguous structures or organs; 3) subtotal
colectomy with or without resection of contiguous structures or organs; 4) total colectomy/proctocolectomy with
or without resection of contiguous structures or organs; 5)
colectomy, not otherwise specified (NOS); and 6) surgery,
NOS. No specific code for appendectomy exists in the
NCDB but the partial colectomy/segmental resection
code reflects and is defined as the performance of an
appendetomy.8 There are no specific codes for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the NCDB. The different types of surgical
resection were regrouped as follows for the cohort with
stage I to III disease: 1) partial colectomy/segmental

Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and
statistical significance was assumed for P values < .05.
Data for continuous variables were reported as the mean6 standard deviation. Discrete values were reported as the
number with the corresponding percentage. Hazard ratios
(HRs) were reported as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). OS estimates were calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier method from the date of diagnosis to the date of death. Patients who were alive at the time
of last follow-up were censored. Separate multivariable
Cox regression models to predict death for patients with
stage I to stage III mucinous and nonmucinous disease
were developed using the variables of grade, sex, chemotherapy status, and type of surgical resection. Similar Cox
regression models to predict death were built for patients

Of 25,992 patients with tumors of the appendix
recorded in the NCDB from 1985 to 2006, a total of
11,871 met the inclusion criteria for final analysis (Fig.
1). The distribution by histologic type was 5971 patients
with mucinous (50.3%), 4805 patients with nonmucinous (40.5%), and 1095 patients with signet ring cell
(9.2%) type (Table 1). The mean age at diagnosis was
higher for patients with nonmucinous tumors (62.5 6
14.6 years) compared with those with mucinous (57.9 6
14.7 years) and signet ring cell-type (56.1 6 12.7 years)
tumors. The histological differentiation of well was more
common in mucinous tumors whereas moderate and
poor differentiation were more common in nonmucinous tumors (Table 1). Patients with signet ring cell-type
histology were more likely to have stage IV disease
(62.7%) compared with patients with mucinous (52%)
and nonmucinous (26.2%) histologic types (Table 1).

moderate, poor, undifferentiated, and unknown grades,
respectively (Fig. 2B). OS rates stratified by stage of disease for mucinous and nonmucinous histologic types are
shown by the Kaplan-Meier plots in Figures 2C and
2D, respectively. The 5-year OS rates for patients with
mucinous stage I to III disease were 74.9%, 63.2%, and
51.1%, respectively, for well, moderate, and poor differentiation (Supporting Information Fig. 1A). Patients
with stage I to III, nonmucinous disease had 5-year OS
rates of 68.9%, 59.6%, and 39.8% for well, moderate,
and poor differentiation (Supporting Information Fig.
1B). Among patients with stage IV disease, the 5-year
OS rates were 56.7%, 31.5%, and 11.3% for patients
with mucinous tumors with well, moderate, and poor
differentiation, whereas the 5-year OS rates were 29.7%,
11.2%, and 6%, respectively, for patients with nonmucinous tumors with well, moderate, and poor differentiation (Supporting Information Figs. 1C and 1D).
Multivariable Cox Regression Analysis for Stage
I to III Disease

On multivariable analysis of patients with stage I to III
disease, higher AJCC stage was associated with an
increased risk of death for both patients with mucinous
and nonmucinous histologic types (Table 2). Stage was
found to be the strongest predictor of death for both
mucinous (stage III: HR, 3.68; 95% CI, 2.96-4.58
[P 5 003]) and nonmucinous histologies (stage III: HR,
2.76; 95% CI, 2.36-3.21 [P<.0001]) (Table 2). Higher
tumor grade predicted an increased risk of death for both
218

mucinous and nonmucinous histologic types. Male sex
also was found to be associated with an increased risk of
death, although the association was higher for the nonmucinous histologic type (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43
[P<.0001]) compared with mucinous histologic type
(HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.31 [P 5 .02]) (Table 2).
Among patients with localized disease, those who underwent a right hemicolectomy had a decreased risk of death
compared with those who underwent an appendectomy
for both mucinous and nonmucinous histological types.
Among both mucinous and nonmucinous histologic
types, there was an associated protective effect for patients
who received systemic chemotherapy compared with those
who did not receive chemotherapy (HR, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.69-0.90 [P 5 .0005] for mucinous; and HR, 0.84; 95%
CI, 0.75-0.95 [P 5 .004] for nonmucinous) (Table 2).
Among patients with stage II to III mucinous and nonmucinous histology, improved OS was observed for patients
who received systemic chemotherapy (Figs. 3A and 3B).
Multivariable Cox Regression Analysis for Stage
IV Disease

On multivariable analysis of patients with stage IV disease, receipt of chemotherapy was not found to be associated with improved survival in the cohort with mucinous
histology (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86-1.04 [P 5 .3]),
whereas patients with nonmucinous histology had
improved survival when chemotherapy was administered
(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.83 [P<.0001]) (Table 3).
Because no code for cytoreductive surgery existed in the
Cancer

January 15, 2016

Chemotherapy in Appendiceal Adenocarcinomas/Asare et al

NCDB, we compared patients who did and did not
undergo a surgical resection. There was a decreased risk of
death among those patients who underwent surgical resection for both histologic types (mucinous: HR, 0.78; 95%
CI, 0.70-0.87 [P<.0001]; and nonmucinous: HR, 0.76;
95% CI, 0.65-0.89 [P 5 .0005]) (Table 3).
Due to the heterogeneity in OS rates among patients
with stage IV disease, OS stratified by histologic type,
grade, and chemotherapy was assessed. There was no statistically significant difference in the median OS for
patients with well-differentiated mucinous histology who
received chemotherapy compared with those who did not
receive chemotherapy (6.4 vs 6.5 years [P not significant])
(Fig. 3C) (Supporting Information Table 1). There was
an improvement in the median OS between patients with
stage IV mucinous disease who received chemotherapy
compared with those who did not among those with moderately differentiated tumors (2.99 vs 1.64 years
[P 5 .0005]) and poorly differentiated tumors (1.57 vs
1.02 years [P 5 .0007]) (Figs. 3D and 3E) (Supporting
Information Table 1).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current analysis represents the largest cohort of patients with appendiceal adenocarcinoma reported to date, and demonstrates the
important interplay between mucinous histology, grade,
and stage. Although grade was found to have a robust
impact on survival for patients with stage IV mucinous
compared with nonmucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma, this impact was not observed among patients with
stage I to III disease. Because significantly different outcomes were noted for patients with moderately and poorly
differentiated mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas,
these data support the removal of the current (seventh edition) AJCC manual’s mucinous high-grade category. It is
important to note that the results of the current study
demonstrate a benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy for
patients with localized disease, and indicate that the benefit is similar between patients with both mucinous and
nonmucinous histologies. In contrast, the benefit of systemic chemotherapy for patients with stage IV disease was
dependent on both histological subtype and grade because
patients with well-differentiated mucinous appendiceal
adenocarcinomas demonstrated no benefit from systemic
chemotherapy.
Similar to a prior report using the SEER database,
the prognostic impact of grade was found to be similar for
localized mucinous and nonmucinous histologies, but was

nous histologies.8 The 5-year OS rate for patients with
well-differentiated and moderately differentiated, mucinous, stage IV disease was 56.7% and 31.5%, respectively,
which is in contrast to the 5-year OS rate of 11.3% for
patients with poorly differentiated, mucinous, stage IV
tumors. These data do not support the current categorization of moderately and poorly differentiated mucinous
histologies into a single mucinous high-grade category,
because a statistically significant near-doubling in the HR
was observed between these 2 grades (1.92 vs 3.71). In
contrast, there was no statistically significant difference
noted between moderate and poor histological grades for
nonmucinous stage IV disease. A recent SEER analysis
found similar findings for stage IV disease, with HRs for
moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated mucinous histologies of 1.6 and 4.9, respectively.8 Further support for a 3-tier system for metastatic mucinous
appendiceal adenocarcinomas was provided by a recent
retrospective study that evaluated several histopathological features and demonstrated significant stratification of
OS across a 3-tiered grading system.9
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data set
to evaluate the role of systemic chemotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Currently, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy is extrapolated
from its benefit for colorectal cancer. The validity of such
an extrapolation is uncertain. Although limited data exist
regarding the molecular alterations of appendiceal adenocarcinomas, preliminary studies have suggested lower
rates of both microsatellite instability and adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC) mutations, which represent the common early genomic events driving the development of
colorectal cancer.11-13 In the current study, we demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy that is similar for both mucinous (HR,
0.79) and nonmucinous (HR, 0.84) histologies. It is interesting to note that a much smaller percentage of patients
with mucinous histology presented with stage III disease
compared with nonmucinous histology (8.9% vs 17.6%).
This was particularly evident for well-differentiated mucinous histology, because 4.9% of patients presented with
stage III disease whereas 42.5% presented with either stage
I or II disease and 52.6% presented with stage IV disease.
This stage distribution supports a preferential peritoneal
manner of spread for mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas in contrast to lymphatic spread. For welldifferentiated, mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas,
this finding correlates with the histological primary lesion
termed a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm,
which is characterized by a pushing invasion with

subsequent fibrosis and a thinning of the appendiceal wall
rather than a direct invasion through the appendiceal wall
layers.14
A major finding from the current study is the lack of
a benefit for systemic chemotherapy for patients with
mucinous, well-differentiated, stage IV disease. This finding is in agreement with the current consensus treatment
approach of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for this subset of cancers with
intraperitoneal involvement.15 Although cytoreductive
surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
are used for higher-grade appendiceal adenocarcinomas,
to the best of our knowledge the benefit of such an
approach is less certain. Because 41% of patients in the
current study with stage IV, mucinous, well-differentiated
appendiceal adenocarcinoma received systemic chemotherapy as their first treatment, these data strongly support
a change in clinical practice. Although a limited number
of retrospective studies have evaluated chemotherapy for
metastatic mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas, the
interpretation of these data is inherently challenging due
to the heterogeneity of behavior across histological grades
and the indolent biology and generally good overall outcome for patients with well-differentiated tumors.16-18 In
what to our knowledge are the 2 largest retrospective
reports evaluating systemic chemotherapy for appendiceal
cancers, efficacy endpoints for chemotherapy were not analyzed across histological grades, and thus the impact of
systemic chemotherapy for well-differentiated as opposed
to poorly differentiated tumor grades could not be determined.17,18 One prospective phase 2 study has been
conducted in patients with mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma.19 In this study of 40 patients with unresectable
pseudomyxoma peritonei of appendiceal origin, semiquantitative reductions in mucinous deposition were
noted in 6 patients (15%).19 The 1-year and 2-year OS
rates were 84% and 61%, respectively. In contrast, a retrospective study evaluating poorly differentiated or signet
ring cell appendiceal adenocarcinomas demonstrated a
response rate of 44%, a median progression-free survival
of 6.9 months, and a median OS of 1.7 years.20 The differential benefit of chemotherapy across tumor grade and
histological subtypes is a reflection of the inherent differences in the biology across these various subsets of appendiceal adenocarcinomas.
Although CSS rates were not available in the NCDB,
the pattern of OS observed in the current study cohort mirrors the trend reported for CSS in studies using SEER data.
The 5-year OS rates for patients with mucinous (53.6%)
and signet ring cell (24.7%) histology reported herein are
220

comparable to studies using SEER data, in which the
5-year CSS rates were 56% for mucinous and 22% for signet ring cell histologic subtypes.8,10 The SEER studies
reported a 5-year CSS rate of 54% for patients with nonmucinous histology whereas the 5-year OS rate from the
current NCDB study was 46%. Similar to previously published literature, stage IV disease, female sex, and welldifferentiated grade were more common among the cohort
of patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma compared with
those with nonmucinous adenocarcinoma.8
The current study has some important limitations.
First, we excluded patients with missing data from the
final analysis, which could potentially introduce bias. Second, the NCDB does not collect data regarding the use of
cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy, or the type and method of administration
of chemotherapy. Because treatment for appendiceal cancer is based on that for colorectal cancer, the systemic
chemotherapy used is reflective of a fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy. For the years 2003 through 2006,
the NCDB recorded the elapsed time from diagnosis to
chemotherapy administration and during this time frame,
<3% of all patients with stage IV mucinous appendiceal
adenocarcinomas received chemotherapy on the same day
as a surgical procedure. This finding strongly supports
that the recording of chemotherapy in the NCDB reflects
the use of systemic chemotherapy. Third, the surgical coding for an appendectomy is imperfect because a partial colectomy/segmental resection code reflects an appendectomy
or cecectomy procedure. Fourth, the NCDB does not
allow for the determination of disease-specific mortality.
This limitation prevents direct comparison of survival estimates with those in other studies in which only CSS mortality was reported. Fifth, the high rate of unknown tumor
grade within mucinous histology reflects a further limitation of the current study. This finding likely reflects the
presence of multiple classification systems for lowcellularity, mucinous appendiceal neoplasms, such as mucinous carcinoma peritonei of low grade or high grade by
Bradley et al or peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis or disseminated adenomucinosis by Ronnett et al.21,22 Our missing grade rate of 32% for mucinous histology is similar to
the rate noted using the SEER database, in which a rate of
35% was noted.8 Despite these limitations, to our knowledge the current study is the largest cohort of patients with
appendiceal adenocarcinoma published to date.
The current large, retrospective cohort study affirms
the importance of histologic grade in predicting survival
outcomes for patients with appendiceal adenocarcinoma.
The evidence from this study does not support the current

Chemotherapy in Appendiceal Adenocarcinomas/Asare et al

AJCC staging system for appendiceal adenocarcinomas, in
which mucinous moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors are classified as high grade and thus consideration should be given to classifying mucinous
appendiceal adenocarcinomas into 3-tiers: well, moderately, and poorly differentiated. Patients with appendiceal
adenocarcinoma with stage IV, mucinous, welldifferentiated histology do not benefit from systemic chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery should be considered as
the frontline treatment among these individuals.
