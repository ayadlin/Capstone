ABSTRACT
We found that levels of miR-491-3p were decreased in multidrug-resistant
tongue cancer (TC) cells. Induction of miR-491-3p expression sensitized TC cells to
chemotherapy. In agreement, functional inhibition of miR-491-3p enhanced resistance
of TC cells to chemotherapy. We found that miR-491-3p directly targeted mTORC2
component Rictor and inhibited mTORC2 activity, which was increased in resistant TC
cells with high p-Akt(Ser473), p-SGK1(Ser422) and p-FOXO1(Thr24) levels. Inhibition
of mTORC2 activity via either Rictor knockdown or mTOR inhibitor in turn sensitized
TC cells to chemotherapy. In agreement, overexpression of Rictor increased the
mTORC2 activity and induced resistance of TC cells to chemotherapy. As a feedback
loop, mTORC2 downregulated miR-491-3p expression by inactivating FOXO1, which
otherwise would transcriptionally induce miR-491-3p expression. Levels of miR-491–3
and Rictor or mTORC2 activity negatively correlated in TC tissues. Finally, low levels
of miR-491-3p and highly expressed Rictor were associated with poor prognosis in
tongue cancer patients. These data provide a rationale for targeted intervention on
miR-491-3p/mTORC2 axis to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy against tongue
cancer.

drug-induced apoptosis, increased DNA repair and
induction of drug-detoxifying mechanisms, have been
proposed to play an important role in the development
of cancer drug resistance [5], the precise causes of
chemotherapy resistance in tong cancer remain elusive.
Recently, both basic research and clinical studies
demonstrate a critical role for miRNAs in chemotherapy
resistance [6]. miRNAs typically function in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes by binding to the
3’-untranslated region (3′UTR) of target messenger RNA
(mRNA), which leads to translational repression or mRNA
degradation [7]. It has been shown that miRNAs regulate a
wide variety of physiological and pathological processes,
including development, differentiation, proliferation,
stress response, metabolism and apoptosis. miRNAs
could function as both tumor suppressors and tumor
promoters in cancer [8]. With regard to cancer treatment,
some studies have suggested that selected miRNAs may

INTRODUCTION
Tongue cancer is the most common oral cancer.
In United States alone, it has been estimated 12,060
new cases and 2030 deaths from tongue cancer in 2011
[1]. Tongue cancer frequently metastasizes and has a
poorer prognosis than carcinoma of other sites in the
oral cavity. In the clinic, tongue cancer usually leads
to malfunction of mastication, speech and deglutition.
Chemotherapy alone or its combination with local/
regional treatment is effective for reducing tumor size,
inhibiting distant metastasis, preserving organ function
and prolonging patient survival [2]. However, the efficacy
of chemotherapy is usually attenuated due to intrinsic
and/or acquired drug resistance. A large proportion of
chemo-resistant tongue cancers show more aggressive
tumor behavior and an even worse clinical outcome [3, 4].
While multiple mechanisms, such as insensitivity to

Specific miRNAs have been shown an altered expression
in drug-resistant cancer cells. For example, miR-34a was
downregulated in drug-resistant prostate cancer cells, and
ectopic expression of miR-34a resulted in growth inhibition
and sensitized the cells to camptothecin [10]; in addition,
miR-200b expression was significantly downregulated
in docetaxel-resistant NSCLC cells [11]. Furthermore,
miRNAs also modulate the process of EMT (epithelialmesenchymal transition) and cancer stem cell program. For
example, Adam et al. showed that miR-200 regulated the
EMT in bladder cancer cells and reversed the resistance to
EGFR inhibitor therapy [12]. A study by Li et al. revealed
that the re-expression of the miR-200 family inhibited EMT
and increased the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to
gemcitabine [13]. Thus, studies to further understand the
role of miRNAs in cancer drug resistance may facilitate the
development of innovative strategies for cancer treatment.
There are limited reports regarding the role of
miRNA in tongue carcinogenesis and drug response.
Wong et al. showed that miR-184 was overexpressed
in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), and the
reduction of miR-184 inhibited cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis through c-Myc downregulation [14].
Li et al. reported that miR-21 was overexpressed in
TSCC relative to the adjacent normal tissues, and miR21 inhibition induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis
in vitro and in vivo [15]. Recently, Sun et al. found that
re-overexpression of miR-200b and miR-15b in cisplatinresistant tongue cancer cells reduced BMI1 expression,
and thereby sensitized the cells to chemotherapy [16].
In the present study, we screened for miRNAs with
differential expression in acquired multidrug-resistant
TSCC cells (Tca8113/PYM) [17] as compared to the
sensitive parent cell line Tca8113. We found that miR491-3p was significantly downregulated in Tca8113/PYM
cells. Importantly, restored expression of miR-491-3p resensitized Tca8113/PYM cells to the treatment of PYM
and cisplatin (cDDP). Conversely, inhibition of miR-4913p reduced the sensitivity of Tca8113, SCC-25 and CAL27 cells to chemotherapy. MiR-491-3p appeared to exert
its effect via regulating Rictor expression in mTORC2
complex. Furthermore, we demonstrated the expression
of miR-491-3p could be transcriptionally regulated by
FOXO1, which was inactivated by mTORC2. Our data
suggest a negative regulatory loop between mTORC2
signaling and miR-491-3p mediated by FOXO1 in chemoresistant tong cancer cells.

its parent cell line Tca8113 were compared by miRNA
microarray analysis. Thirty seven (37) differentially
expressed miRNAs were identified using a cutoff value
of 2-fold change between the two cell lines. Of these 37
miRNAs, 25 were upregulated and 12 were downregulated
in Tca8113/PYM cells (Figure 1A). The data were further
confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Nine miRNAs were
examined, and a good correlation between the qRT-PCR
results and the microarray data was observed (Figure 1B).

miR-491-3p modulates chemosensitivity in
tongue cancer cells
MiR-491-3p expression was significantly down
regulated in the chemo-resistant Tca8113/PYM cells. To
investigate whether the reduction of miR-491-3p played a
causal role in the development of drug resistance, we used
a gain- or loss-of-function approach in a series of tongue
cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 1C, miR-491-3p
expression was relatively higher in chemo-sensitive SCC-25
and CAL-27 tongue cancer cell lines than that in Tca8113/
PYM cells. Increased miR-491-3p via transfection of
miR-491-3p mimics significantly enhanced the sensitivity
of Tca8113/PYM cells to PYM- and cDDP-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis (Figure 2A). Inversely, the
sensitivity of Tca8113 (Figure 2B), SCC-25 (Figure 2C)
and CAL-27 (Figure 2D) cells to PYM or cDDP was
dramatically decreased upon inhibition of miR-491-3p with
specific inhibitor, accompanied with reduced apoptosisinduced by PYM or cDDP.

miR-491-3p directly targets Rictor, a component
of mTORC2 complex
We next used miRNA database TargetScan (http://
www.targetscan.org) to predict potential targets of
miR-491-3p. The mTORC2 component Rictor with
a conserved binding site of miR-491-3p was selected
for further identification (Figure 3A). There was no
significant difference of the Rictor mRNA level in
selected cell lines (Figure 3B). However, the Rictor
protein level in Tca8113/PYM cells was much higher
than that in Tca8113, SCC-25 and CAL-27 cell lines
(Figure 3C). Notably, transfection with miR-491-3p
mimics significantly downregulated Rictor protein level
in Tca8113/PYM cells, and the miR-491-3p inhibitor
clearly upregulated Rictor protein level in Tca8113,
SCC-25 and CAL-27 cell lines (Figure 3D). To assess
whether Rictor is a direct target of miR-491-3p, a
luciferase reporter vector containing the putative Rictor
3’UTR target site for miR-491-3p (pMir-Wt, as wildtype
version) or a mutant version with a deletion of 7bp in the
seed sequence was constructed (pMir-Mut). As shown, in
Tca8113, SCC-25 and CAL-27 cell lines, the luciferase
activities from mutant version were higher than that from
wildtype version. In contrast the luciferase activity from
wildtype version in Tca8113/PYM cells was higher than

suggesting that endogenous miR-491-3p inhibits Rictor
expression by binding to the seed sequence in the
3’UTR of Rictor mRNA. Moreover, miR-491-3p mimics
significantly repressed the luciferase activity of the
vector with wild-type Rictor 3’UTR in Tca8113/PYM
cells, but the mutant version abrogated the repressive
ability of miR-491-3p (Figure 3F). Inversely, miR-4913p inhibitor increased the luciferase activities from the
wildtype version, and the mutant version abrogated the
facilitative effect of miR-491-3p inhibitor (Figure 3F).
These results strongly demonstrated the specificity of
miR-491-3p targeting Rictor mRNA.

Rictor is an essential component of the mTORC2
complex and it is required for mTORC2 full function.
Because of the significant reduction of miR-491-3p
leading to Rictor upregulation in Tca8113/PYM cells,
the expression levels of Rictor and mTORC2 activity
were much higher in Tca8113/PYM cells than that in
Tca8113, SCC-25 and CAL-27 cell lines, which was
reflected by the levels of phosphorylated Akt(Ser473),

Additional experiments were performed to study whether
mTORC2 was involved in the development of chemoresistance in tongue cancer cells. Tca8113/PYM cells were
transfected with Rictor specific siRNAs to knockdown
Rictor expression, and si-2# markedly reduced Rictor
protein levels (Figure 4A). This was accompanied with
decreased mTORC2 activity (Figure 4B). Importantly,
downregulation of Rictor significantly sensitized
Tca8113/PYM cells to PYM- and cDDP-induced growth
inhibition and apoptosis (Figure 4D). Similarly, the mTOR
inhibitor KU-0063794 also attenuated mTORC2 activity
(Figure 4B) and sensitized Tca8113/PYM cells to the
treatment of PYM and cDDP (Figure 4E). In contrast,
ectopic expression of Rictor markedly increased mTORC2
activity (Figure 4B) and reduced the sensitivity of
Tca8113 (Figure 4F), SCC-25 (Figure 4G) and CAL-27
(Figure 4H) cell lines to PYM and cDDP. Collectively,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these data indicate that increased mTORC2 activity
confers chemo-resistance in tongue cancer cells.

mTORC2 signal inhibits miR-491-3p expression
via FOXO1 inactivation
The mTOR signaling pathway regulates many cellular
processes and is implicated in a number of pathological
conditions. Thus, we next investigated the potential feedback
regulation of miR-491-3p expression by mTORC2. We
found that both Rcitor knockdown and treatment with an
mTOR inhibitor led to significant increase of miR-491-3p
expression in Tca8113/PYM cells (Figure 5A), whereas
elevated expression of Rictor downregulated miR-4913p expression in Tca8113, SCC-25 and CAL-27 cell
lines (Figure 5B). It has been shown that the transcription
factor FOXO1 acts as a tumor suppresser, and can be
phosphorylated by Akt and SGK1 protein kinases. The

phosphorylated FOXO1 (p-FOXO1) translocates from the
nucleus to cytoplasm leading to transcriptional inactivation.
We then analyzed the response elements of a cohort of
transcription factors located within 2kb region upstream of
miR-491-3p precursor start site using the online software
“The JASPAR database”. We identified four putative
FOXO1 binding sites (A, B, C, and D) within it (Figure 5C).
To validate the direct association of FOXO1 with the
promoter of miR-491-3p, we performed ChIP-qPCR assays

lower than those in the chemo-sensitive tongue cancer cell
lines (Figure 5D). Moreover, both Rictor knockdown and
inhibition of mTOR activity with KU-0063794 promoted
FOXO1 binding to miR-491-3p promoter at site A and site D
(Figure 5E). This was accompanied with acceleration of
FOXO1 transcriptional activation evidenced by the reduced
p-FOXO1 (Figure 4B). In contrast, overexpression of Rictor

assess whether the 2kb region indeed has promoter activity,
the 2kb DNA was cloned into the pGL4 reporter plasmid.
We found that the luciferase activity driven by the potential
promoter of miR-491-3p was much higher in Tca8113,
SCC-25 and CAL- 27 cell lines than that in Tca8113/PYM
cells (Figure 5G). In addition, both Rictor knockdown and
inhibition of mTOR activity enhanced the luciferase activity
(Figure 5H). Conversely, ectopic expression of Rictor not
only decreased the binding of FOXO1 to the promoter of
miR-491-3p (Figure 5F), it also significantly suppressed
the promoter activity in Tca8113, SCC-25 and CAL-27

cell lines (Figure 5I). Taken together, these results strongly
support that FOXO1 physically binds to the promoter region
of miR-491-3p to drive its transcription. The mTORC2
signaling pathway downregulates miR-491-3p expression
via inhibiting the transcriptional activation of FOXO1.

axis might associate with the prognosis of tongue cancer
patients. The expression levels of miR-491-3p and
several components of mTORC2 signaling pathway were
evaluated in clinical samples of tongue cancer patients. We
performed in situ hybridizations (ISH) to detect miR-4913p and immunohistochemical staining to examine Rictor,
p-Akt(Ser473), p-SGK1(Ser422) and p-FOXO1(Thr24) in
the tissues from 84 tongue cancer patients who received
chemotherapy based on PYM and/or cDDP. Remarkably,
ISH results demonstrated that 62 (73.81%) tongue cancer
tissues exhibited relative low expression of miR-491- 3p.
Among the 62 tissues, 56 of them (90.32%) showed
relative high expression levels of Rictor, p-Akt(Ser473),
p-SGK1(Ser422), and p-FOXO1(Thr24) (Figure 6A
and 6B). On the other hand, Rictor protein was highly
expressed in only 5 (22.7%) of 22 tongue cancer tissues
with relative high expression of miR-491-3p (Figure 6B),
suggesting an inverse correlation between miR-491-3p
and Rictor in tongue cancers. Importantly, tongue cancer
patients with low expression of miR-491-3p have a
poorer prognosis for overall survival as compared to the
patients with high expression of miR-491-3p (Figure 6C).
Interestingly, high protein levels of Rictor was also
predictive for a worse overall survival in tongue cancer
patients (Figure 6D). Moreover, tongue cancer patients
with low levels of miR-491-3p and highly expressed
Rictor exhibited a significantly worse overall survival than
the patients with high levels of miR-491-3p and reduced
expression of Rictor (Figure 6E). These data demonstrated
a negative expression pattern between miR-491–39 and
Rictor or mTORC2 activity, indicating that miR-491-3p
might target Rictor mRNA in vivo as well. Our clinical
studies support that the miR-491-3p/mTORC2 axis
associates with the prognosis of tongue cancer patients.

potential role in regulating meiotic recombination- and
synapsis-related genes [18]. As to cancer, miR-491-3p
was found to be downregulated in retinoblastoma cells
under hypoxic condition, which is an essential feature
of retinoblastoma and contributes to poor prognosis
and resistance to conventional therapy [19]. Recently,
Li et al. observed that miR-491-3p was downregulated
in glioblastoma multiforme samples as compared to
the normal brain tissues. Overexpression of miR-4913p inhibited glioma cell invasion and proliferation and
impaired the propagation of glioma stem cells [20].
Our current studies revealed an inverse correlation
between miR-491-3p and Rictor in tongue cancer cell
lines and clinical samples. The results from luciferase
reporter assays confirmed that Rictor was a direct target
of miR-491-3p in tongue cancer. Rictor expression status
negatively associated with chemo-sensitivity in tongue
cancer cell lines and with the overall survival of tongue
cancer patients. Rictor is an essential component of the
mTORC2 complex, and is required for its full function.
The evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr kinase mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) plays a pivotal role
in regulating cell growth, proliferation and survival.
Aberrant activation of mTOR signaling is frequently
observed in many types of cancers, implicating its cancer
promoting role. mTOR interacts with several proteins to
form distinct complexes named mTORC1 and mTORC2.
In general, mTORC1 controls cell growth by regulating
mRNA translation via phosphorylation of S6K (ribosomal
S6 kinase) and 4E-BP1 (4E binding protein 1), whereas
mTORC2 regulates cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis,
growth and actin cytoskeleton by activating Akt, PKC-α
(protein kinase C-α) and SGK1 (serum-glucocorticoidinduced protein kinase-1) [21, 22]. Many gliomas
overexpress the specific mTORC2 subunit Rictor. Forced
expression of Rictor promotes mTORC2 assembly
and activation, and endows cancer cells with increased
proliferation and invasion potential [23]. Conversely,
Rictor downregulation suppresses cell proliferation and
migration, and promotes apoptosis in certain cancers
[24, 25]. In mice, the development of prostate cancer
induced by the loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN requires
mTORC2 function mediated by Rictor [28]. Recent
investigations indicate that several miRNAs, such as miR152 [29], miR-218 [30], miR-424 and miR-503 [31], were
involved in the dysregulation of Rictor expression. Here,
we showed that Rictor was overexpressed accompanied
with increased mTORC2 activation due to miR-491-3p
downregulation in drug resistant tongue cancer cells.
Both Rictor knockdown and mTOR inhibitor inactivated
the mTORC2 downstream signaling such as Akt, SGK
and FOXO1, and re-sensitized tongue cancer cells to
chemotherapy.We also found the level of p-FOXO1
increased in tongue cancer cell lines and clinical samples
with high Rictor and mTORC2 activity and low expression
levels of miR-491-3p. FOXO1 acts as tumor suppressor

DISCUSSION
Although significant advances have been made in
the treatment of various types of cancer, drug resistance
remains a major clinical obstacle. Better understanding of
the underlying mechanisms is urgently needed to improve
the current regimens of chemotherapy. Recent studies
indicate that aberrant miRNAs expression is strongly
implicated in drug resistance [6]. In the present study,
miR-491-3p was found to be downregulated in PYMinduced multidrug resistant tongue cancer cells termed
as Tca8113/PYM. Restored expression of miR-491-3p
sensitized Tca8113/PYM cells to chemotherapy, whereas
functional inhibition of miR-491-3p led to enhanced
resistance of tongue cancer cells to chemotherapy. More
importantly, we uncover a reduced expression of miR491-3p in the majority of tongue cancer tissues and its
downregulation significantly predicts for a poor prognosis
of overall survival in tongue cancer patients. These results
suggest that miR-491-3p plays a tumor suppressive role
in tongue cancer. MiR-491-3p was thought to play a

and its inactivation has been documented in many types
of human cancer [32]. FOXO1 activation inhibits tumor
cell survival by inducing apoptosis in glioma cells through
upregulating pro-apoptotic factors [33]. Our studies
determined a negative feedback loop between miR-4913p expression and mTORC2 activity through the transcrip­
tion factor FOXO1. Bioinformatics analysis combined

with ChIP-qPCR uncovered the physical binding of
FOXO1 to the miR-491-3p promoter in tongue cancer
cells. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed the direct
transcriptional regulation of miR-491-3p by FOXO1.
In summary, as shown in Figure 6F, our studies
demonstrated an important role of the negative feedback

quantitative expression was calculated by normalizing
the results with RNU6. The total RNA was extracted
according to the Trizol protocol, and cDNAs from the

in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To maintain the
resistance phenotype, 0.5mg/L PYM was added to the
culture media of Tca8113/PYM cells. PYM was from
PYM Harbin Bolai Pharmaceutical (Harbin, China).
cDDP was from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
KU-0063794 was from Selleck Chemicals (Houston,
Texas, USA). Eighty-four tongue cancer tissue
specimens were obtained from patients at the Affiliated
Tumor Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University
between March 2000–December 2006. Overall survival
was computed from the day of surgery to the day of
death or of last follow-up. The study was approved by
the ethics committee of the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of
Guangzhou Medical University.

Transfection
miR-491-3p mimics, miR-491-3p inhibitor, and
relative controls were purchased from Exiqon (Vedbaek,
Denmark). Cells were trypsinised, counted and seeded
onto 6-well plates the day before transfection to ensure
70% cell confluence on the day of transfection. The
transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s procedure. The mimics, inhibitor and
controls were used at a final concentration of 100 nM.
At 36 h post-transfection, follow-up experiments were
performed. The siRNAs target to Rictor and control were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas,
USA). The transfection of 50 nM siRNA or control, and
4 μg of the pcDNA3.1-control and pcDNA3.1-Rictor
plasmids were performed as above, 48 h later, Rictor
was determined by western blot, and the experiment was
repeated four times.

miRNA array analysis

MTS assay

After two weeks of culture without PYM, total RNA
was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), and it was further purified using the RNeasy
mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The miRNA
profiles were compared using miRCURY LNA (locked
nucleic acid) microarray (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark)
according to the manual.

The CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
was used to determine the sensitivity of cells to PYM or
cDDP. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a
density of 4 × 103 cells/well (0.2 ml/well) for 24 h before
use. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium
containing PYM or cDDP at different concentrations and
cells were then incubated for a further 72 h. Then, MTS
(0.02 ml/well) was added. After a further 2 h incubation,
the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded for each well on
the BioTek Synergy 2. The absorbance represented the cell
number and was used for the plotting of dose–cell number
curves.

Real-time PCR for mature miRNAs
and mRNAs
miRNAs from cultured cells were isolated and
purified with the miRNA isolation system (Exiqon). cDNA
was generated with the miScript II RT Kit (QIAGEN), and
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed by
using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The miRNA
sequence-specific RT-PCR primers and the endogenous
control RNU6 were purchased from QIAGEN. The relative

Oncotarget

(5 mg/L) for an additional 48 h. The cells were then
stained with hoechst33528, and apoptotic cells possessing
significantly smaller, condensed and fragmented nuclei,
were observed using a fluorescence microscope. The
apoptotic cell number was determined for at least three
fields-of-view for each treatment and the apoptotic rate
then calculated.

was determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) on the BioTek Synergy 2. The
Renilla luciferase activity was used as internal control
and the firefly luciferase activity was calculated as the
mean ± SD after being normalized by Renilla luciferase
activity.

ChIP-qPCR

Western blotting

The ChIP assay was performed using the EZ-CHIPTM
chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Merck Millipore).
Briefly: Chromatin proteins were cross-linked to DNA
by addition of formaldehyde to the culture medium to
a final concentration of 1%. After a 10 min incubation at
room temperature, the cells were washed and scraped off
in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail II. Cells were pelleted and
then resuspended in lysis buffer containing Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail II. The resulting lysate was subjected
to sonication to reduce the size of DNA to approximately
200–1000 base pairs in length. The sample was centrifuged
to remove cell debris and diluted ten-fold in ChIP dilution
buffer containing Protease Inhibitor Cocktail II. Then
5 μg of anti-RNA Polymerase antibody (positive control,
included with the kit), or anti-FOXO1 antibody (cell signal
technology) were added to the chromatin solution and
incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. After antibody
incubation, protein G agarose was added and the sample
incubated at 4°C with rotation for an additional 2 h. The
protein/DNA complexes were washed with Wash Buffers
four times and eluted with ChIP Elution Buffer. Crosslinks were then reversed to free DNA by the addition of
5 M NaCl and incubation at 65°C for 4 h. The DNA was
purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
50 μl of DNA was obtained for each treatment. 2 μl
of DNA from each group was used as a template for
PCR. Primers for the miR-491-3p promoter containing
putative FOXO1 binding sites were as follows, sense:
5′-GAGATCAAGGGAACTTGGTTTTTC-3′, antisense:
5′-CAGGGCCCTCTAGGTCACC-3′ (for site A);
sense: 5′-GTTAATCTAGGGCTGTTTATTGACAT-3′,
antisense: 5′-ATCCCATTTCCATGAAGCACTGAAC-3′
(for site B); sense: 5′-GGTTTGAATTTCCAAATTCTCT
TATCC-3′, antisense: 5′-GTTCAGTTAAAAATCC
ACAGAACAGG-3′ (for site C); sense: 5′-GACATGG
AAAGCAAATATT
TGAAATTG-3′,
antisense:
5′-GAGGGGCCTACTAGTT
AATCAAG-3′
(for
site D). Primers for the human GAPDH gene: sense,
5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′,
antisense,
5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′. The PCR
conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 95°C for 5 min; 40
cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C 30 s; and
1 cycle of 72°C for 10 min. The results were calculated by
normalizing to the positive control, and relative quantization
values were calculated using % positive control = 2^(–ΔCt
[(Ct [FOXO1] – (Ct [positive control]]) method.

Total protein was extracted from cells using
RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) in
the presence of protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail, Thermo Scientific). The protein concentration
of lysates was measured using a BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Scientific). Equivalent amounts of protein were
mixed with 5 × Lane Marker Reducing Sample Buffer
(Thermo Scientific), and resolved by electrophoresis
in a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel and then transferred
onto Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane (Merck Millipore,
Schwalbach, Germany). The membranes were blocked
with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and
then incubated with primary antibodies followed by
secondary antibody. The signal was detected on the
Odyssey instrument (LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln,
Nebraska USA). Rictor, p-Akt(Ser473) and β-Actin
were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,
USA), p-SGK1(Ser422) was from Thermo Scientific.
p-FOXO1(Thr24) was from Merck Millipore. The
fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were from LICOR Bioscience.

Luciferase reporter assay
For miRNA luciferase reporter assay: The DNA
sequences with each 50 base at up-and downstream of
miR-491-3p binding site in the 3’UTR of Rictor (as
wildtype version) and DNA sequences with 7 bases
deleted in the miR-491-3p binding site (as mutant
version), were synthesized with restriction sites for SpeI
and HindIII located at both ends of the oligonucleotides
for further cloning, and subsequently cloned into
pMir-Report plasmid downstream of firefly luciferase
reporter gene. Cells were seeded in 96 well-plates and
co-transfected with pMir-Report luciferase vector, pRLTK Renilla luciferase vector and miR-491-3p mimics
or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For
promoter activity assay: To determine whether FOXO1
regulates the promoter activity of miR-491-3p, a two
kilobase region upstream of the miR-491-3p precursor
starting site was cloned into the pGL4-reporter vector
upstream of the luciferase gene. Cells were seeded
in 96-well plates and co-transfected with the pGL4reporter vector and the pRL-TK Renilla luciferase
vector with or without the pcDNA3.1-Rictor vector
using. After transfection of 48 h, luciferase activity

miRNA In Site Hybridizations (ISH) assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The miR-491-3p expression in tongue cancer
samples was detected by In Site Hybridizations (ISH)
with kit from Exiqon (Vedbaek Denmark) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the sections were
dried at 65°C for 3 h and then deparaffinized in xylene and
ethanol at room temperature (RT) followed with a 10 min
incubation with proteinase-k at 37°C. After dehydration in
ethanol, sections were hybridizated with 40 nM double-DIG
LNA™ miR-491-3p probe 55°C for 1 h. After wash in SSC
buffer at hybridization temperature and incubation with
blocking solution for 15 min, the anti-DIG reagent sheep
anti-DIG-AP (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was applied
and incubated for 60 min at RT. After wash in PBST, the
sections were incubated with AP substrate NBT-BCIP
(Roche) for 2 h at 30°C and incubated in KTBT buffer to
stop reaction. Then the nuclear counter stain Nuclear Fast
Red™ (Vector labs, Burlingame, CA) was applied for 1
min for nuclear counter staining, and slides were rinsed
in tap water for 10 min. after dehydrated in ethanol and
mounted, the sections were investigated and analyzed under
microcopy.

Immunohistochemistry
A tissue array containing 84 human tongue cancer
specimens was cut into 4-μm sections. The sections were
dried at 62°C for 2 h and then deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated using a series of graded alcohol washes. The
tissue slides were then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide
in methanol for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase
activity and antigen retrieval then performed by incubation
in 0.01 M sodium cirate buffer (pH 6.0) and heating using
a microwave oven. After a 1 h preincubation in 10% goat
serum, the specimens were incubated with primary antibody
overnight at 4°C. The tissue slides were treated with a nonbiotin horseradish peroxidase detection system according to
the manufacturer’s instruction (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark).
Two different pathologists evaluated the immunohistological
samples.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
statistical software (version 21.0; IBM). Survival curves
were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method and
analyzed by the log-rank test. Significant prognostic
factors identified by univariate analysis were entered into
multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards
model. The Student’s t-test was used for comparisons
and the Pearson correlation test (two-tailed) was used
to investigate the correlation between miR-491-3p and
Rictor protein level. Statistical significance was defined
as p < 0.05.
