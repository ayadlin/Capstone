Abstract
Thiopurines including 6-thioguanine (SG), 6-mercaptopurine, and azathioprine are effective anticancer
agents with remarkable success in clinical practice, especially in effective treatment of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). SG is understood to act as a DNA hypomethylating agent in ALL cells, however, the
underlying mechanism leading to global cytosine demethylation remains unclear. Here we report that SG
treatment results in reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes in T leukemia cells. Bisulfite genomic
sequencing revealed that SG treatment universally elicited demethylation in the promoters and/or first exons
of the genes that were reactivated. SG treatment also attenuated the expression of histone lysine-specific
demethylase 1 (LSD1), thereby stimulating lysine methylation of the DNA methylase DNMT1 and triggering
its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Taken together, our findings reveal a previously
uncharacterized but vital mechanistic link between SG treatment and DNA hypomethylation. Cancer Res;

Introduction
In mammalian cells, methylation of DNA at the C5 of
cytosine at CpG dinucleotide is one of the major epigenetic
modifications that play important roles in embryonic development, gene regulation, cell differentiation, and genomic
imprinting (1, 2). Aberrant methylation within CpG islands
in the genome links to genomic instability and leads to the
development of many diseases, including cancer (3, 4).
Promoter CpG methylation is generally correlated with gene
silencing. Previous studies showed that tumor-suppressor
genes are silenced owing to methylation of CpG islands in
their promoter regions (5, 6). Therefore, promoter cytosine
demethylation and the resultant reactivation of silenced
genes in cancer cells are feasible approaches to cancer
therapy.
DNA methylation in mammalian cells is established and
maintained by a family of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases
(DNMT) including DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (7).

DNMT1 functions primarily as a maintenance DNA methyltransferase responsible for methylating hemimethylated CpG
sites following DNA replication (8, 9), whereas DNMT3A and
DNMT3B exhibit de novo methyltransferase activity that establishes DNA methylation patterns (10, 11). Dysregulation in
DNMT1 was thought to play a critical role in cellular transformation (12). Along this line, constitutive overexpression of
an exogenous mouse DNMT1 results in a significant increase in
global DNA methylation that is accompanied by tumorigenic
transformation in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (13). In contrast,
DNMT1 knockouts are resistant to colorectal tumorigenesis
(14), and knockdown of DNMT1 by either antisense or siRNA
results in demethylation and activation of tumor-suppressor
genes (15, 16). DNMT1 is upregulated in multiple human
cancers (17, 18) and previous studies showed that the regulatory regions of tumor-suppressor genes are hypermethylated in
tumors (19). Therefore, DNMT1 has been proposed as a target
for anticancer therapy (12). Indeed, preclinical studies using
antisense to DNMT1 have shown inhibition of tumor growth
both in vitro (16) and in vivo (20).
Thiopurine drugs, which were first synthesized and investigated by Elion and coworkers (21, 22), are widely used as
anticancer and immunosuppressive agents and they have
achieved remarkable success in clinical practice, especially
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment (23–27). SG
is the ultimate active metabolite of all thiopurine prodrugs. It
was proposed that SG exerts its cytotoxic effect via its incorporation into DNA, its subsequent methylation by S-adenosylL-methionine (S-AdoMet) to render S6-methylthioguanine
(S6mG), which directs the misincorporation of dTMP during
DNA replication (27). The resulting S6mG:T mispair can

Mechanism of DNA Hypomethylation Induced by 6-thioguanine

trigger the postreplicative mismatch repair (MMR) pathway
and futile cycles of repair synthesis may ultimately induce cell
death (27). On the other hand, the very low level of conversion
of DNA SG to S6mG (<0.02%) in SG-treated leukemia cells and
the relatively high mutagenic potential of SG itself suggest that
DNA SG may trigger the MMR pathway without being converted to S6mG (28–30). However, the proposed MMR-related
mechanism may not be the only pathway for SG to exert its
cytotoxic effect during ALL treatment viewing that MMRdeficient ALL cells were also sensitive toward SG (31).
Our recent study showed that the treatment of Jurkat-T cells
with SG could lead to a significant decrease in global cytosine
methylation (32). Likewise, the level of cytosine methylation in
newly synthesized DNA decreased in MOLT-F4 human malignant lymphoblastic cells and HEK-293 T cells upon treatment
with SG or 6-MP (33, 34). In addition, treatment of HEK-293T
cells with SG or 6-MP could elicit a decrease in the enzymatic
activity of DNMT1 in the whole-cell lysate and a drop in the
level of DNMT1 protein (34). However, the mechanism through
which the SG induces decreases in DNMT1 protein level and
global cytosine methylation remains unclear.
Recent reports revealed that the stability of DNMT1 was
regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (35), which
involves the methylation of lysine residues in DNMT1 through
a dynamic interplay between histone lysine methyltransferase
Set7 (36, 37) and histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1;
ref. 37). These studies provided a mechanistic link between
DNA and histone methylation systems. Additionally, DNMT1
was found to be rapidly and selectively degraded upon treatment with 5-azacytidine (5-aza-C) or 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine
(5-aza-CdR) through the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (35).
Therefore, we reason that the SG-induced decrease in DNMT1
may occur through a similar mechanism. In this study, we
have shown that SG could reactivate epigenetically silenced
genes in leukemic cells by facilitating proteasome-mediated
degradation of DNMT1. In addition, this process involves the
downregulation of LSD1, which established the mechanism
underlying the SG-induced hypomethylation in leukemic cells.

at 37 C for 4 hours. To the digestion mixture were then added
12.5 units of alkaline phosphatase and 0.05 unit of snake venom
phosphodiesterase in a 50-mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.6). The
digestion was continued at 37 C for 3 hours, and the enzymes
were removed by chloroform extraction. The amount of nucleosides in the mixture was quantified by UV absorbance measurements. The mixtures were then separated by HPLC on an Agilent
1100 capillary pump (Agilent Technologies) with an Agilent
1100 UV detector monitoring at 260 nm. A 4.6250-mm Polaris
C18 column (5 mm in particle size, Varian Inc.) was used. A
solution of 10-mmol/L ammonium formate (pH 4.0, solution A)
and a mixture of 10-mmol/L ammonium formate and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v, solution B) were employed as mobile phases. A
gradient of 5 minutes 0%–4% B, 45 minutes 4%–30% B, and 5
minutes 30%–100% B was used, and the flow rate was 0.80 mL/
min. Under these conditions, we were able to resolve 5-methyl20 -deoxycytidine (5-mdC) from other nucleosides. The global
cytosine methylation in cells was quantified based on the peak
areas of 5-mdC and 20 -deoxycytidine (dC) with the consideration of the extinction coefficients of the 2 nucleosides at 260 nm
(5,020 and 7,250 L/mol/cm for 5-mdC and dC, respectively).
Bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis
Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite by using
EZ DNA Methylation Kit. Amplified PCR products for RPIB9
(Rap2-binding protein 9), PCDHGA12 (protocadherin-g subfamily A member 12), DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), and
asparaginase were subcloned using the pGEM-T cloning system (Promega). PCR primers were listed in Table S1. Approximately 15 colonies for each gene were sequenced using an ABI
3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Cell culture
Jurkat-T, CEM, HEK-293T, and HL-60 cells (ATCC) were
cultured under the ATCC-recommended conditions. Jurkat-T
cells were treated with 3 mmol/L SG (Sigma) and/or 25 mmol/L
MG132 (Enzo Life Sciences International), which is a proteasome inhibitor. The whole-cell extracts were prepared by
suspending cells in CelLytic M (Sigma) lysis buffer containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Genomic DNA from the
cultured cells was isolated by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) and desalted by ethanol
precipitation. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells
by using RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized by using iScript cDNA synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's
recommended procedures. Briefly, 1 mg of total RNA was
reverse-transcribed with 1 mL iScript reverse transcriptase
and 4 mL 5iScript reaction mixture in a 20 mL reaction
volume. The reaction was carried out at 25 C for 5 minutes
and at 42 C for 30 minutes. The reverse transcriptase was then
deactivated by heating at 85 C for 5 minutes.
Quantitative real-time qRT-PCR was conducted using iQ
SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad) on a Bio-Rad iCycler
system (Bio-Rad), and the running conditions were at 95 C
for 3 minutes and 45 cycles at 95 C for 15 seconds, 56 C for 30
seconds, and 72 C for 45 seconds. The comparative cycle
threshold (Ct) method (DDCt) was used for the relative
quantiﬁcation of gene expression (38), and GAPDH gene
was used as the internal control. The mRNA level of each
gene was normalized to that of the internal control. The
primers for real-time PCR were list on Table S2.

as described above. Primer sequences used for RT-PCR were
shown in Table S2, and GAPDH was used as an internal

antibodies that specifically recognized human DNMT1 (New
England Biolabs), DNMT1-K142me (36), LSD1 (Cell Signaling),
b-actin (Abcam) were used at 1:3000, 1:1000, 1:10,000, and
1:10,000 dilutions, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Abcam) was
used at a 1:10,000 dilution.

G treatment leads to decrease in global cytosine
methylation in cultured human cells
Thiopurine drugs have been successfully employed for
treating ALL (27) and a number of genes in bone marrow
leukocytes from ALL patients and in 2 ALL cell lines (Jurkat-T
and NALM-6) were found to be epigenetically silenced (39).
Viewing that the mean peak concentration of SG in plasma of
ALL patients was 0.52  0.72 mmol/L after oral SG administration (60 mg/m2) and 2.7  1.4 mmol/L after continuous
intravenous infusion (20 mg/m2/h; ref. 40), we treated Jurkat-T
cells with 3 mmol/L SG from 6 to 24 hours and assessed the
level of global cytosine methylation by using an HPLC method
(Fig. S1 shows a typical HPLC trace for monitoring the global
cytosine methylation; ref. 32). It turned out that treatment
with 3 mmol/L SG for 6 and 24 hours led to appreciable
decreases in global cytosine methylation in Jurkat-T cells,
that is, the percentage of cytosine methylation dropped from
3.74  0.02% in untreated cells to 3.57  0.12%, 3.52  0.08%,
and 3.34  0.03% in cells treated with 3 mmol/L of SG for 6, 12,
and 24 hours, respectively (Fig. 1A). Similarly, SG exposure
could lead to loss in global cytosine methylation in other
human cell lines. In this regard, treatment of HEK-293T, HL60, and CEM cells with 3 mmol/L of SG for 24 hours resulted in
decreases in cytosine methylation from 3.61  0.16%, 3.63 
0.04% and 4.05  0.14% to 3.46  0.03%, 3.29  0.07%, and
3.75  0.11%, respectively (Fig. 1B).

G treatment resulted in the reactivation of genes
silenced in ALL cells
Previous large-scale CpG methylation analysis revealed that
the promoter regions of 11 genes were aberrantly methylated
in primary leukocytes from ALL patients and in cultured ALL
cells (39). To determine whether the SG-induced global cytosine hypomethylation can reactivate the expression of these
genes, we examined, by using quantitative real-time RT-PCR,
the mRNA levels of these genes in Jurkat-T cells before and
after SG treatment. It turned out that mRNA expression levels

of all these genes increased in Jurkat-T cells after SG treatment
(Fig. 1C). For instance, there were more than 4-fold increases
in mRNA levels of DCC, KCNK2, LRP1B, NKX6–1, NOPE,
PCDHGA12, and RPIB9 genes after treatment with SG for
48 hours.

of these genes were substantially elevated after SG treatment

of global cytosine methylation (Fig. 1A) and abolished the SGmediated decrease in DNMT1 protein level (Fig. 3A), supporting that the SG-induced degradation of DNMT1 involved the

could induce the demethylation in the predicted promoter
and/or the first exon of genes thereby stimulating the expression of these genes.
S

G treatment led to the proteasomal degradation of
DNMT1
To further explore the molecular mechanism underlying the
S
G-induced cytosine demethylation, we determined the protein levels of DNMT1 in the extracts of cells treated with SG for
various time periods as DNMT1 is the major maintenance
cytosine methyltransferase in mammalian cells. Immunoblot
analysis of cell extract indeed revealed a time-dependent
decrease in DNMT1 level following SG treatment (Fig. 3A).
To determine whether the drop in DNMT1 level was due to
the downregulation of its transcription, we measured the
mRNA level of DNMT1 by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). Upon
treatment with 3 mmol/L SG, the DNMT1 transcript level was
similar to that of the control cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, the SGinduced decrease in DNMT1 protein level was not due to a
decline in its mRNA level.
A previous report showed that DNMT1 could be rapidly
degraded upon 5-aza-CdR treatment through the ubiquitinproteasomal pathway (35). We reasoned that the SG-induced
DNMT1 degradation might also occur through the same
pathway. If this is the case, the drug-elicited DNMT1 degradation should be rescued by pretreating the cells with a proteasome inhibitor. It turned out that treatment of cells with
proteasome inhibitor MG132 indeed restored the percentage

G could induce the downregulation of LSD1 and the
increase in lysine methylation in DNMT1
Recent studies revealed that the stability of DNMT1 protein
was dynamically regulated by its methylation on lysine residues via histone lysine methyltransferase Set7 (36, 37) and
histone LSD1 (37). Thus, we further investigated whether the
S
G-mediated degradation of DNMT1 involved the alteration in
the protein level of Set7 and/or LSD1. It turned out that the
treatment of Jurkat-T cells with SG led to a decrease in LSD1 at
both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4A and C); the SGinduced downregulation of LSD1 in Jurkat-T cells was not
restored by MG132 at either mRNA or protein level (Fig. 4B
and D), which pointed to the transcriptional regulation of
LSD1. However, there was no apparent alteration in Set7 level
in Jurkat-T cells treated with SG (Fig. S2). In addition, siRNA
knockdown of LSD1 in HEK-293T cells (Fig. S3) induced the
degradation of DNMT1 as did SG (Fig. S4 A and B), revealing
that SG may trigger DNMT1 degradation via diminishing the
LSD1 expression.
It was reported that K142 was a major site responsible for
the regulation of DNMT1 stability (36). Next, we assessed
whether SG treatment could result in the alteration of K142
methylation in DNMT1. Immunoblot results showed that
there was no significant change in K142-methylated DNMT1
in Jurkat-T or HEK-293T cells upon treatment with SG (Fig. S5
and Fig. S4C). However, the total amount of DNMT1 protein
decreased markedly upon SG treatment (Fig. 3A), suggesting
that the percentage of K142-methylated DNMT1 increased
upon SG treatment. In addition, the methylated DNMT1
protein was rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway, which may account for the lack of accumulation of
the methylated DNMT1 upon SG treatment. In this vein, it was
found that the methylated DNMT1 had a much shorter halflife (2–6 hours) than its unmethylated counterpart (12–24
hours; ref. 36). Taken together, our results have shown that SG
could decrease the expression of LSD1, which led to enhanced
lysine methylation in DNMT1 and its subsequent degradation
via the proteasomal pathway.

Discussion
We investigated the epigenetic effect of SG and discovered a
novel mechanism underlying the SG-induced global cytosine
demethylation in ALL cells. Our results have shown that SG
exerted its epigenetic effect by downregulating the expression
of LSD1, thereby enhancing the lysine methylation level in
DNMT1 and triggering its degradation via the proteasomal
pathway. The diminished DNMT1 expression led to subsequent promoter demethylation and reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes in ALL cells.
Treatment of Jurkat-T cells with SG resulted in elevated
expression of 12 genes, 11 of which were previously shown to
be epigenetically silenced in primary ALL cells and 2 ALL cell

lines (39). Although the explicit roles of these genes in the
pathobiology of ALL remain unclear, the epigenetically
silenced state of these genes in ALL cells and their reactivation
upon SG treatment suggest that these genes might serve as
important molecular targets for ALL treatment and act as
biomarkers for monitoring the efficacy of ALL treatment.
ABCB1, RPIB9, and PCDHGA12 have functions that may be
associated with patient response to ALL chemotherapy (41,
42). DCC, DLC-1, and LRP1B were identified as tumor-suppressor genes and were aberrantly methylated in cancer cells
(43–45). Bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed the druginduced demethylation in the putative promoter and/or the
first exon of DCC, asparaginase, RPIB9, and PCDHGA12 genes,
which provided insights into the mechanisms accounting for
the elevated mRNA expression of these genes in Jurkat-T cells
after SG treatment.
An interesting observation is that the expression level of the
asparaginase gene was increased upon SG treatment. Different
from normal cells, ALL cells are unable to synthesize the
nonessential amino acid asparagine (46); thus, the survival of
leukemic cells depends on circulating asparagine. This forms
the basis of using E. coli asparaginase in the clinical treatment
of ALL (46, 47), where the enzyme catalyzes the decomposition
of L-asparagine to L-aspartic acid and ammonia. In current
protocols of ALL treatment, asparaginase, along with other
drugs, are often used in the remission-induction phase,
whereas methotrexate plus mercaptopurine are frequently
used in consolidation treatment (48). Our real-time PCR

various time periods. D, western
blot analysis of LSD1 with wholecell extracts from Jurkat-T
cells pretreated with MG132
(25 mmol/L) for 2 hours and then
treated with SG for various time
periods. The histograms shown
under (C) and (D) are the LSD1 fold
changes, which were obtained by
normalizing the band intensity of
LSD1 to that of the loading
control, b-actin. The results
represent the means and standard
deviations of data from 3
independent drug treatment and
Western blot experiments.

results showed a 3-fold increase in asparaginase expression
upon SG treatment at 24 hours, which may further deprives the
leukemic cells of asparagine and contributes to the killing of
residual leukemic cells during the consolidation treatment.
Thus, our results underscored a potentially new pathway
contributing to the antileukemic effect of SG. It is important
to investigate in the future whether the same finding can be
made for ALL patients administered with the thiopurine drug.
It has been recently shown that LSD1 was able to
demethylate and stabilize DNMT1 protein from its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (37). By using
metabolic labeling method, the authors found that the
methylation level of DNMT1 was markedly increased in
Aof21lox/1lox (LSD1-deficient) cells when compared with
Aof22lox/þ (LSD1-proficient) cells (37). These results underscored enhanced methylation of DNMT1 protein in the
absence of LSD1, suggesting that DNMT1 is susceptible to
LSD1-mediated lysine demethylation in vivo. The stability of
DNMT1 was also regulated by the histone methyltransferase
activity of Set7 through the methylation of DNMT1 at K142
(36). In this study, we found that LSD1 was decreased at both
the mRNA and protein level, but there was no significant
change in Set7 level upon SG treatment, revealing that the
diminished expression of LSD1 may lead to enhanced
DNMT1 methylation. The methylated DNMT1 can then be
subjected to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Taken together, this study offers a rational explanation
for the demethylation in DNA and reactivation of silenced
