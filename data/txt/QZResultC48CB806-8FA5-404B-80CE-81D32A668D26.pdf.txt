Abstract
Elevated Src family kinase (SFK) activity is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. The SFK inhibitor saracatinib (AZD0530) is currently in phase II trials in patients including those with colorectal cancer
(CRC), where links between SFK activity and poor prognosis are particularly striking. Saracatinib is likely
to be used clinically in combination regimens, specifically with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin, in
CRC. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of saracatinib on oxaliplatin and 5-FU efficacy in
CRC cells. Saracatinib did not modulate 5-FU efficacy but antagonized oxaliplatin in a schedule-specific
manner through reduced oxaliplatin uptake via an SFK-independent mechanism. Saracatinib resembles the
pharmacophore of known organic cation transporter (OCT) inhibitors and reduced oxaliplatin efficacy
maximally in cells overexpressing OCT2. These data suggest that oxaliplatin uptake in CRC is attenuated
by saracatinib via inhibition of OCT2, a potential consideration for the clinical development of this SFK
inhibitor. Cancer Res; 70(14); 5931–41. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The gene encoding the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase
c-Src was the first proto-oncogene to be described when identified as the cellular homologue of v-Src, the transforming factor of the Rous sarcoma retrovirus (1). c-Src is one of the nine
members of the Src family kinases (SFK) and, along with two
other members, Fyn and Yes, is ubiquitously expressed (2). Of
the nine SFKs, c-Src is the most comprehensively studied on
its role in cancer. Increased levels of c-Src activity occur in several solid tumor types, including colorectal, breast, and lung
cancers (3). In colorectal cancer (CRC), c-Src activity is elevated in more than 70% of tumors and increases with tumor
progression (4–7) where high c-Src activity correlated with
poor clinical prognosis (8).

A major role of c-Src activity in cancer is promotion of migration and invasion leading to a more aggressive and metastatic cancer phenotype (9). Currently, there are four SFK
inhibitors in oncology clinical trials, including saracatinib
(AZD0530), a potent, orally available SFK inhibitor (10). Consistent with the studies outlined above, SFK inhibition by saracatinib has varying and cell context–dependent effects on
cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo but consistently inhibits
migration, invasion, and metastasis across a range of cancer
types (11). In common with other targeted agents, saracatinib is likely to be used clinically in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents; indeed, preclinical studies have
shown that saracatinib enhances the antimigratory effects
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cell lines (12) and
restores tamoxifen sensitivity to resistant breast cancer cell
lines (12, 13).
In a phase II trial in patients with previously treated metastatic CRC, saracatinib alone had negligible effect on overall
survival (14). Thus, combining saracatinib with standard-ofcare agents may present an alternative strategy to target SFK
in CRC. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate
the effect of saracatinib on oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) responses in CRC cell lines.

(ATCC) and HEK293-overexpressing organic cation transporter (OCT) isoforms (15) in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies), all supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Biowest) in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C and 5% CO2.
OCT-overexpressing cells were also supplemented with
800 μg/mL G418 (Life Technologies). All cell lines were authenticated using the Ampflstr system (Applied Biosystems)
during the study. Oxaliplatin (Alexis Biochemicals), cisplatin
(Sigma), 5-FU (Sigma), saracatinib, and PP2 (4-amino-5(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine;
Calbiochem) were diluted to the indicated concentrations in
media from stock solutions.
Western blotting
Cell lysis and Western blotting were carried out as previously described (16). The following primary antibodies were
used: anti-pY576FAK, anti-pY861FAK (Biosource), anti-FAK
(Santa Cruz), anti–c-Src (Upstate), anti-Yes, anti-Fyn (Wako),
and anti-actin (Sigma).
Sulforodamine B assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated as described, fixed for 1 hour with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and left to dry. Cells were then stained with 0.4%
Sulforodamine B (SRB) for 15 minutes and washed with 1%
acetic acid, the dye was solubilized with 1.5 mol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8.8), and the absorbance at 540 nm was determined.
Comet-X assay
After treatment, cells were irradiated with 45-Gy from an
X-ray source and processed for comet-X assay as previously
described (17), where 100 nuclei on two slides were measured for each treatment.
Platinum concentration determination
After treatment, cells were either processed with a
blood and cell culture DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate
samples to determine DNA-associated platinum concentration, or lysed in cell lysis buffer [Cell Signaling; supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)] to
determine soluble and protein-associated platinum levels.
DNA concentration was determined on a Nanodrop-2000
(Thermo Scientific) and protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Perbio) following the
manufacturers' instructions. Samples were hydrolyzed by
incubating 90 μL of sample with 10 μL of 10 mol/L
NaOH at 60°C for 1 hour and then adding 900 μL of
1 mol/L nitric acid and incubating at 70°C overnight.
Platinum concentration was measured on an ELAN DRc
ICP-MS (Perkin-Elmer SCIEX).
RNA interference
HCT116 cells were transfected with c-Src or nontargeting
SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) at 100 nmol/L using the
DharmaFECT 2 siRNA transfection reagent according to
the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 hours, siRNA was
replaced with full growth medium.

Wound healing assay
Scratches were made in confluent HCT116 cell monolayers
grown in ImageLock 24-well plates using a Woundmaker
(Essen); medium was removed and replaced with medium
containing the specified drugs. Cells were placed in an Incucyte (Essen) and the wound was imaged every 2 hours for
48 hours. The percent wound closure after 48 hours was determined using Incucyte scratch wound assay software
(Essen).
ASP+ uptake assay
HEK293 cells overexpressing OCT isoforms (106) were
washed with warm HCO3-free Ringer's-like solution [RLS;
130 mmol/L NaCl, 4 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl 2 ,
1 mmol/L MgSO4, 1 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 20 mmol/L HEPES,
18 mmol/L glucose (pH 7.4)] and incubated in RLS containing
the indicated concentration of saracatinib for 10 minutes at
37°C. 4-(4-Dimethylaminostyryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+;
Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 μmol/L and
the cells were incubated for a further 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells
were washed twice in ice-cold RLS and solubilized in isopropanol. Fluorescence was measured after 485 nm λex at 610 nm
on a Fluostar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech)
Molecular modeling
The OCT pharmacophore was generated as follows: Tetrapentylammonium ion (TPA) was overlaid on decynium-22
using the Omega software package (OpenEye Scientific
Software) and low-energy conformations of tTPA and
decynium-22 were generated. ROCS (Rapid Overlay of
Chemical Structures; ref. 18) was then used to overlay TPA
conformations on the lowest-energy decynium-22 conformer,
based only on shape (Shape-Tanimoto scoring function). The
best 1,000 TPA conformers from this filter were then compared with decynium-22 using shape and electrostatics, using
the ET-Combo scoring function from EON. Finally, using this
overlaid decynium-22/TPA pair, a four-point pharmacophore
was generated using MOE (Chemical Computing Group).
Subsequently, a pharmacophore search was performed for
conformations of a set of 20 known nontransported OCT2
inhibitors (19) and for saracatinib. The MOE Wash function
was used in combination with ACD/I-Labs (Advanced
Chemistry Development, Inc.) to assign protonation states
and tautomers of the library of compounds before conformer
enumeration by Omega.
Statistics
Student's t test, two-way ANOVA, and IC50 calculations
were performed using Prism (GraphPad).

Results
Saracatinib reduced the efficacy of oxaliplatin, but not
cisplatin, in a schedule-dependent manner
Because saracatinib is likely to be used to treat patients
with metastatic CRC in combination with other standard
of care drugs, the effect of saracatinib was assessed in two
CRC cell lines treated with oxaliplatin or 5-FU. The cell lines

chosen for this study, HCT116 and WiDr, have low and medium levels of c-Src activity, respectively (20, 21). Saracatinib
treatment for 24 hours reduced the levels of phosphorylated
FAK, a target of SFKs, in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 1A), showing that saracatinib inhibited SFK activity in
these cellular contexts. It is interesting to note that even low
concentrations of saracatinib lead to increased levels of total
FAK, although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Saracatinib had little effect on the proliferation of
HCT116 or WiDr cells; a 6-day treatment of 1 μmol/L saracatinib had minimal effect on either cell line (Fig. 1B), consistent with previously published data (11). To better mimic

clinical exposure, cells were treated for 1 hour with oxaliplatin or for 6 days with 5-FU, both of which caused a concentration-dependent reduction in cell population (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Fig. S1). The addition of saracatinib had no
effect on 5-FU efficacy in either cell line (Supplementary
Fig. S1). However, if saracatinib and oxaliplatin were added
simultaneously and saracatinib was replenished after oxaliplatin removal, there was a significant decrease in oxaliplatin
efficacy in both cell lines [Fig. 1B; P < 0.001 for oxaliplatin
versus oxaliplatin and saracatinib in HCT116 and WiDr
(two-way ANOVA)]. The negative effect of saracatinib on oxaliplatin was schedule dependent; if saracatinib was added to

oxaliplatin (C). Six days after the
removal of oxaliplatin/cisplatin,

determined as an approximation of
cell population. Graphs show

cells after the 1-hour oxaliplatin exposure, there was no effect
on oxaliplatin efficacy (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, concomitant
saracatinib exposure did not affect cisplatin (Fig. 1D) or carboplatin (Supplementary Fig. S2) efficacy, suggesting that
saracatinib does not reduce the efficacy of all platinating
agents, but interacts with oxaliplatin specifically.
Saracatinib reduced oxaliplatin-induced
DNA cross-links
The mechanism of action of oxaliplatin is thought to
be predominantly via DNA damage induced by DNAplatinum-DNA interstrand cross-links (22). Therefore, the
effect of saracatinib on oxaliplatin-induced DNA crosslinks was investigated using the comet-X assay (23). Cells

were treated with oxaliplatin or cisplatin for 1 hour in
the presence (and sara) or absence (then sara) of saracatinib and then grown in the absence of the platinum
agent, with saracatinib where indicated, for a further
8 hours to allow DNA interstrand cross-links to form
(24). In the comet-X assay, reduced DNA in the comet tail
is indicative of increased DNA interstrand cross-linking.
The exposure of HCT116 or WiDr to oxaliplatin or cisplatin caused a significant reduction in the amount of
DNA in the comet tail, whereas the presence of saracatinib during the 1-hour oxaliplatin exposure caused a significant increase in the comet tail relative to oxaliplatin only
(Fig. 2A). Adding saracatinib after oxaliplatin exposure did
not alter comet tail size, nor did addition of saracatinib

Saracatinib Inhibits Oxaliplatin Uptake via OCT

during cisplatin exposure. This suggests that saracatinib can
cause a reduction in the amount of oxaliplatin-induced DNA
interstrand cross-links, but only when present at the time of
oxaliplatin treatment.
To formally test if the reduction in oxaliplatin-induced
DNA interstrand cross-links caused by saracatinib was
due to reduced platinum-DNA adducts, the level of DNAassociated platinum was measured using inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was isolated from
cells treated with oxaliplatin or cisplatin in the presence or
absence of saracatinib, either immediately after the removal
of the platinum or 8 hours after platinum removal. Results
shown in Fig. 2B are relative to the corresponding oxaliplatin
or cisplatin only treatment. The presence of saracatinib during the 1-hour oxaliplatin exposure (ox and sara) reduced the
amount of DNA-platinum adducts by ∼50% immediately after and 8 hours after oxaliplatin removal (Fig. 2B). If saracatinib was added after removal of oxaliplatin (ox then sara), it
had no effect on DNA-platinum adduct level. Regardless of
the schedule, saracatinib had no effect on DNA-platinum adducts in cisplatin-exposed cells. This confirmed that saracatinib reduced oxaliplatin-induced DNA-platinum adduct
levels if present during the oxaliplatin exposure.
Saracatinib reduced uptake of oxaliplatin
There are at least two possible explanations for the change
in oxaliplatin-induced DNA-platinum adducts caused by saracatinib: Either saracatinib causes an increase in the rate of
removal of oxaliplatin-induced DNA-platinum adducts (if
present during treatment) or saracatinib reduces the total level of oxaliplatin in the cell, either by inhibiting uptake or increasing efflux. Due to the fact that the relative level of
DNA-platinum adducts did not change over time, the reduced
oxaliplatin uptake explanation seemed the more plausible.
Therefore, the level of soluble/protein-adducted platinum
was determined from cells treated with the same drug combinations as in Fig. 2B. The level of soluble/protein-adducted
platinum was reduced to 60% to 80% compared with oxaliplatin only when saracatinib was present during the 1-hour oxaliplatin exposure (ox and sara) and not in any of the other
experimental conditions (Fig. 2C). This strongly suggested
that the presence of saracatinib reduced the uptake of oxaliplatin into HCT116 and WiDr CRC cells.
c-Src RNA interference did not phenocopy the effect of
saracatinib on oxaliplatin efficacy
The effect of c-Src RNA interference (RNAi) on oxaliplatin efficacy was assessed to determine whether the interaction between saracatinib and oxaliplatin was due to
inhibition of c-Src by saracatinib. Transfection of siRNAs
targeting c-Src mRNA into HCT116 cells consistently reduced the level of c-Src (Fyn levels were also reduced
whereas levels of Yes were unchanged; Fig. 3A) and also
reduced phosphorylated FAK levels, showing reduced
c-Src activity. However, c-Src RNAi did not affect oxaliplatin efficacy (Fig. 3B; P > 0.05, two-way ANOVA), suggesting
that c-Src activity is not necessary for oxaliplatin efficacy
or uptake. Therefore, the observed interaction between

www.aacrjournals.org

saracatinib and oxaliplatin is unlikely to be due to inhibition of c-Src activity.
The SFK inhibitor PP2 did not phenocopy the effect of
saracatinib on oxaliplatin efficacy
As well as inhibiting c-Src, saracatinib also inhibits other
members of the SFK family (11). Therefore, to determine
whether the interaction observed between saracatinib and
oxaliplatin could be attributed to SFK inhibition, the effect
on oxaliplatin efficacy of a second SFK inhibitor, PP2, was
investigated. Unlike saracatinib treatment, 3-day exposure
of HCT116 cells to PP2 leads to a reduction in cell number
(data not shown), presumably due to inhibition of a non-SFK
kinase by PP2 but not by saracatinib (25), which makes direct
comparison between saracatinib/oxaliplatin and PP2/oxaliplatin combinations difficult over prolonged periods. Thus,
the experimental design was altered to examine the effect
of PP2 or saracatinib only during the 1-hour oxaliplatin exposure. Both saracatinib and PP2 inhibited SFK activity within 1 hour, as assessed by Western blotting for levels of
phosphorylated FAK (Fig. 3C). When saracatinib was added
to cells only during the 1-hour oxaliplatin exposure, oxaliplatin efficacy was reduced [Fig. 3D, top; P < 0.001 for oxaliplatin
versus oxaliplatin and saracatinib (two-way ANOVA)] as predicted by the hypothesis that saracatinib inhibits oxaliplatin
uptake. However, the addition of PP2 during a 1-hour oxaliplatin exposure had no effect on the efficacy of oxaliplatin
[Fig. 3D, bottom; P = 0.98 for oxaliplatin versus oxaliplatin
and PP2 (ANOVA)]. Overall, these data comparing two SFK
inhibitors in conditions where SFKs are inhibited by both
suggest that the effect of saracatinib on oxaliplatin uptake
is independent of inhibition of SFK activity.
Oxaliplatin did not affect the potency of saracatinib
Because saracatinib inhibited oxaliplatin uptake, it is possible that both drugs enter the cell via the same transporter
and that, reciprocally, the presence of oxaliplatin may also
inhibit the uptake of saracatinib. To test this hypothesis,
the effect of oxaliplatin on biomarkers of SFK inhibition
in saracatinib treated cells was investigated. As the predominant effect of saracatinib in a range of cancer cell types
(including CRC, breast, and lung) was to inhibit migration
(11), combinations of saracatinib and oxaliplatin were assessed on their antimigratory properties. Saracatinib
(1 μmol/L) alone caused a 74% reduction in the migration
of HCT116 cells, 3 μmol/L oxaliplatin (a concentration
whose efficacy was antagonized by saracatinib in constant
challenge experiments; data not shown) had no effect,
whereas 10 μmol/L oxaliplatin caused a 34% reduction in
migration (Fig. 4A; P < 0.05, Student's t test). When
3 μmol/L oxaliplatin was combined with 1 μmol/L saracatinib, it did not alter the ability of saracatinib to inhibit migration, whereas there was a further reduction in migration
when 1 μmol/L saracatinib and 10 μmol/L oxaliplatin were
combined (P < 0.05, Student's t test). The effect of oxaliplatin on saracatinib-mediated reduction in phosphorylated
FAK was also assessed, where HCT116 cells were treated
for 2 hours with varying concentrations of saracatinib and

oxaliplatin. A 2-hour time point was chosen, as oxaliplatin
can provoke an adaptive increase in SFK activity, but it
takes longer than 2 hours for this to occur (ref. 26 and
confirmed by data not shown). Irrespective of the presence
of oxaliplatin, saracatinib reduced FAK phosphorylation
over the same concentration range (Fig. 4B). These data
suggest that oxaliplatin does not impair the ability of saracatinib to inhibit SFK activity, and thus, that it is unlikely
that saracatinib uptake is inhibited by oxaliplatin.

Saracatinib inhibited uptake by OCTs
The observation that saracatinib inhibited the uptake of
oxaliplatin but not cisplatin implies that saracatinib inhibits
a transporter that distinguishes between these two platinum
drugs. Members of the OCT family of transporters can influx
oxaliplatin more effectively than cisplatin (27, 28), whereas
OCT3 expression has been shown to correlate with oxaliplatin sensitivity in CRC (29). OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3 are expressed in HCT116 and WiDr cells (30, 31), and therefore

siRNA or siRNA targeting c-Src. A, 48 h later, the levels of c-Src, Yes, Fyn, FAK, or FAK phosphorylated on tyrosine 576 or 861 were determined by
Western blotting. Actin was used as a loading control. B, 24 h after transfection, cells were plated and, 24 h later, exposed for 1 h to the indicated

blots are representative of three independent experiments. Graphs show the mean of three independent experiments carried out in triplicate ± SEM.

overexpressing OCT2 (Fig. 5A; Asp + uptake in parental
HEK293 cells was negligible). Thus, saracatinib inhibited
uptake via OCT2 at concentrations that inhibit oxaliplatin
uptake. Furthermore, PP2 had no significant effect on Asp+
uptake in cells overexpressing OCT2 [Supplementary Fig. S3;
P > 0.05, PP2 versus DMSO (two-way ANOVA)], consistent
with PP2 not causing oxaliplatin resistance.
To test further the causal relationship between OCT transporter function and saracatinib-mediated antagonism of
oxaliplatin, the effect of combining oxaliplatin and saracatinib was determined in OCT-overexpressing cells. All the
HEK293 cells, including parental cells, exhibited a concentration response to oxaliplatin in the absence of saracatinib;
however, cells overexpressing OCT2 were >20-fold more
sensitive to oxaliplatin than any of the other cells (Fig. 5B;
oxaliplatin IC50: OCT2, 14 nmol/L; parental, 320 nmol/L;
OCT1, 520 nmol/L; OCT3, 910 nmol/L). Furthermore,
whereas the addition of saracatinib reduced the oxaliplatin
efficacy in all cell lines, this was most pronounced in
OCT2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5C). Specifically, 1 μmol/L
saracatinib caused the IC50 of oxaliplatin to increase 1.7-,
1.6-, and 2.4-fold in parental, OCT1, and OCT3 cells, respectively, and 5.8-fold in OCT2-overexpressing cells. Taken
together, these data implicate saracatinib-mediated
modulation of OCT2 as the mechanism underlying reduced
uptake of oxaliplatin in CRC cell lines.

levels of FAK and FAK phosphorylated on tyrosine 861 were determined

experiments.

the effect of saracatinib on uptake via OCT1, OCT2, and
OCT3 was assessed. HEK293 cells that overexpress OCT1,
OCT2, or OCT3 (15) were incubated in saracatinib for 10 minutes before Asp + , a fluorescent substrate of OCTs, was
added to the cells. The effect of saracatinib on Asp+ uptake
was then determined. Saracatinib was able to inhibit uptake
of Asp+ in all three cell lines (IC50 for OCT1, 27.1 μmol/L;
OCT2, 0.46 μmol/L; and OCT3, 10.3 μmol/L), although it
was over an order of magnitude more potent against cells

Saracatinib fits the pharmacophore of known
OCT inhibitors
To explore the molecular basis for saracatinib (Fig. 6A) as an
OCT2 inhibitor, a pharmacophore was derived identifying key
molecular features required for recognition by OCT2. Using
two potent OCT2 inhibitors, decynium-22 and TPA (Supplementary Table S1), a four-point pharmacophore was generated, consisting of a central feature satisfied by a cationic or
hydrogen bond donor group, surrounded by three hydrophobes in an approximately T-shaped configuration (Fig. 6B).
This pharmacophore was then able to identify 19 compounds
from a set of 20 known nontransported OCT inhibitors (ref. 19;
Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the pharmacophore
derived here bears considerable similarity in orientation and
nature to a previously reported four-point OCT1 pharmacophore (32). However, their central pharmacophore point differs in requiring solely a cationic group, which would lead to
exclusion of a small number of compounds from the OCT
inhibitor set considered here.
Saracatinib was found to adopt low-energy conformations,
which also satisfy all four features of this OCT pharmacophore. One such conformation of saracatinib satisfies the
central polar feature via a cationic amine in the piperazine
ring; ligand methylene and cyclic groups also satisfy the
hydrophobicity requirements of the OCT pharmacophore
(Fig. 6C). The second distinct saracatinib conformation maps
to the polar feature of the pharmacophore via an NH group
that links the benzodioxolane and quinazoline rings. For this
conformation, two aromatic rings and one aliphatic sixmembered ring satisfy the hydrophobicity requirements of
the OCT pharmacophore (Fig. 6D). Both these conformations

lie within 0.2 kcal/mol of the lowest-energy pose. Therefore,
saracatinib possesses the shape and polarity necessary for
OCT inhibition. Furthermore, PP2, which does not cause
resistance to oxaliplatin or inhibit uptake via OCT2, does
not satisfy the OCT pharmacophore.

Discussion
Because cancer is a multi-lesion group of diseases that will
usually require a combination therapy approach, it is imperative that drug interactions are understood to optimize the
chances of treatment success. Drug resistance is a predominant obstacle for the treatment of cancer and can occur at a
variety of loci proximal and distal to drug targets. Changes in
drug transport in and out of cancer cells have been a recognized mechanism of drug resistance for a variety of anticancer drugs. This can occur at the biological level, where, for
instance, drug efflux pumps are overexpressed in tumor cells,
or via competition of two drugs for the same uptake mechanism. A plethora of oncogenic signal transduction interrupt-

ing drugs have entered oncology clinical trials, and thus far,
very few have achieved single agent status. Because current
standard-of-care therapies show efficacy in most tumor
types, combinations with conventional cytotoxic agents are
common, not only following ethical considerations but also
in a hope that efficacy can be increased by combination therapy. The rationale for investigating the combination of saracatinib with CRC standard-of-care chemotherapeutics was to
predict whether saracatinib might enhance or detract from
the chemotherapeutic agent if the two were combined in
the clinic—a likely scenario if saracatinib were used to treat
patients with advanced metastatic CRC.
The main findings of this study are that the SFK inhibitor
saracatinib can antagonize the effects of oxaliplatin in human CRC cells in vitro. This antagonism was highly schedule
dependent, with the presence of saracatinib during oxaliplatin treatment being essential for antagonism. Furthermore,
saracatinib did not antagonize cisplatin or carboplatin efficacy, demonstrating oxaliplatin specificity not common to all
DNA platinating agents. The oxaliplatin antagonism was

Saracatinib Inhibits Oxaliplatin Uptake via OCT

due to reduced uptake of oxaliplatin in the presence of
saracatinib and was independent of SFK inhibition. Finally,
saracatinib was also shown to inhibit uptake of OCT
substrates, including oxaliplatin, in cells engineered to overexpress OCT2, consistent with a fit of saracatinib as an OCT
inhibitor pharmacophore.
The data presented here differ from a work reporting a
CRC cell line–dependent synergy between the SFK inhibitor
dasatinib and oxaliplatin (33). In this report, the synergy is
dependent on SFK activation after oxaliplatin exposure due
to reactive oxygen species generation. Whereas an increase
in SFK activity is observed in both of the cell lines described
in the present study after oxaliplatin exposure (data not
shown), there is no observed synergy with saracatinib.
However, it has been shown that dasatinib is not a substrate
for OCT (34) and therefore is unlikely to inhibit oxaliplatin
uptake, potentially explaining these contrasting results.
Another report has shown that combining oxaliplatin and saracatinib in vivo had a beneficial effect in an orthotopic mouse
model of liver metastasis.5 Indeed, data in the present study
(Fig. 4A) show that combining oxaliplatin and saracatinib
has at least an additive effect on inhibiting cell migration.

Therefore, it is possible that combining oxaliplatin and saracatinib may prove clinically beneficial in appropriate settings,
which may be even more pronounced if scheduling regimens
are used that avoid coadministration of the two drugs.
There are two likely mechanisms by which saracatinib
could inhibit uptake via OCT2: Either saracatinib directly
binds to and inhibits OCT2 or it inhibits a factor, such as a
kinase, which is essential for OCT2 function. Several kinases
have been implicated in regulating OCT2 activity, including
protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulindependent kinase II (CaMKII), and the SFK member Lck
(35, 36). Saracatinib can inhibit Lck activity (11); however,
PP2 also targets Lck (25) yet does not affect oxaliplatin efficacy, making it unlikely that saracatinib inhibition of OCT2
activity is due to Lck inhibition. Furthermore, saracatinib did
not inhibit serine/threonine protein kinases in a kinase
screen (11), reducing the probability that saracatinib inhibits
PKA, PKC, or CaMKII. The fact that saracatinib fits a pharmacophore of known OCT inhibitors, many of which are also
transported by OCT, suggests that saracatinib may bind to
OCT2 and thus directly inhibit OCT2.
Previously, schedule-dependent interactions of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and EGFR protein kinase inhibitor vandetinib (Zactima; ref. 37) and the EGFR
inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa; ref. 38) with oxaliplatin were attributed to mechanistic interactions between DNA damage
and growth/survival signaling pathways. Oxaliplatin was

shown to influence the sensitivity of cells to treatment with
gefitinib as a result of increasing or decreasing EGFR phosphorylation (39), and has also been shown to activate SFKs
via the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(33). In addition to a mechanism-based interaction, vandetinib, gefitinib, and saracatinib share an anilinoquinazoline
backbone that fits the pharmacophore generated from
known OCT inhibitors, suggesting a common mechanism
by which these inhibitors may interact with oxaliplatin. Indeed, recent work has shown that gefitinib can inhibit
OCT1 and OCT2 functions (40), whereas uptake of the
Abl inhibitor imatinib is OCT dependent and downregulation of OCTs in chronic myeloid leukemia has been proposed as a mechanism for imatinib resistance (41).
Interaction with OCT function may be a more generalized
phenomenon that requires consideration when potential
novel drug combinations are undertaken.
One of the major physiologic roles of OCTs is the excretion
of organic cations, including antibiotic, antiviral, antidiabetic, and cancer chemotherapeutics, via the liver and kidney
(19). There are several examples of drugs that inhibit OCT,
altering the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of other
OCT substrates, such as the antiretroviral drugs lamivudine
and zalcitabine, which interact with each other (42), or the
histamine H 2 receptor antagonist cimetidine, which increases the plasma concentration of the antidiabetic drug
metformin (43). Therefore, it is highly plausible that novel
agents sharing the OCT pharmacophore could alter the
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of coadministered drugs, and the data presented here for oxaliplatin

and saracatinib suggest that this possibility should be
anticipated and incorporated into schedule planning. In
conclusion, this study has shown that saracatinib inhibits
uptake of oxaliplatin in CRC cells where uptake via OCT2
is strongly implicated as the underlying mechanism.
Follow-up studies where OCT2 is knocked down by RNA interference will allow this hypothesis to be tested; however,
this will first require the generation of specific antibodies
to access efficient downregulation of OCT2.
