ABSTRACT
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase ATR represents a central
checkpoint regulator and mediator of DNA-repair. Its inhibition selectively eliminates
certain subsets of cancer cells in various tumor types, but the underlying genetic
determinants remain enigmatic. Here, we applied a synthetic lethal screen directed
against 288 DNA-repair genes using the well-defined ATR knock-in model of DLD1
colorectal cancer cells to identify potential DNA-repair defects mediating these
effects. We identified a set of DNA-repair proteins, whose knockdown selectively
killed ATR-deficient cancer cells. From this set, we further investigated the profound
synthetic lethal interaction between ATR and POLD1. ATR-dependent POLD1
knockdown-induced cell killing was reproducible pharmacologically in POLD1depleted DLD1 cells and a panel of other colorectal cancer cell lines by using chemical
inhibitors of ATR or its major effector kinase CHK1. Mechanistically, POLD1 depletion
in ATR-deficient cells caused caspase-dependent apoptosis without preceding cell
cycle arrest and increased DNA-damage along with impaired DNA-repair. Our data
could have clinical implications regarding tumor genotype-based cancer therapy,
as inactivating POLD1 mutations have recently been identified in small subsets
of colorectal and endometrial cancers. POLD1 deficiency might thus represent a
predictive marker for treatment response towards ATR- or CHK1-inhibitors that are
currently tested in clinical trials.

Synthetic lethality is defined as the interaction
of two non-lethal mutations, which in combination are
incompatible with cell viability. This mechanism could
facilitate tumor-specificity for pharmacologic therapeutic
approaches through the specific targeting of defined
tumor cell alterations with agents, which act synthetically
lethal with these alterations [3]. Consequently, a weak
single-agent anticancer activity could be potentiated in
certain subpopulations of tumor patients [4]. One of the
most striking examples for this approach is illustrated
by the inhibition of PARP in BRCA1- and BRCA2deficient cancers and is currently under intense clinical
investigation [5, 6]. In addition, several other synthetic

INTRODUCTION
Genome integrity is ensured by a complex DNA
damage response (DDR) network. Alterations in this
network, predisposing cells to exogenous and endogenous
genotoxic stress, are often linked to tumorigenesis [1, 2]
and compensatory DNA-repair gene activation [2]. Some
DNA-repair pathways might thus provide exploitable
targets through synthetic lethal interactions in subgroups
of tumors harboring certain DNA-repair defects and
thus facilitate novel selective and tumor-specific
therapeutic approaches besides the classical chemo- and
radiotherapeutic regimens.

lethal interactions between DDR genes elicited by either
classical gene knockout or chemical inhibition have been
reported [7–9].
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK)-related kinase
ATR is a central regulator of the replication checkpoint
during DDR signaling [10]. At sites of replication
stress or DNA damage, ATR promotes cell cycle arrest
induction and replication fork stabilization prior to
the initiation of homologous recombination-mediated
DNA-repair [11, 12]. Recently, several compounds for
the specific targeting of ATR have been developed [13].
These ATR-inhibitors cause the elimination of certain
subsets of tumor cells, but the underlying mechanisms
remain poorly defined [14, 15]. Due to the central role
of ATR in the DDR, synthetic lethal interactions of
ATR with certain tumor-mutated DNA-repair genes
might at least partly explain this selective tumor cell
killing by ATR-inhibitors. In fact, pharmacological
inhibition of ATR has previously been demonstrated to
act synthetically lethal with ATM, XRCC1 and ERCC1
deficiency [16–19] as well as CYCLIN E and oncogenic
RAS overexpression [20, 21].
The aim of this study was to identify synthetically
lethal interactions between ATR and certain DNA-repair
genes, applying a siRNA library of all major DNA-repair
genes in a well-characterized genetic ATR knock-in
model of DLD1 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells [14, 22,
23] harboring the hypomorphic ATR-Seckel mutation.
From the identified set of DNA-repair genes that act
synthetically lethal with ATR, the profound effects of
POLD1 were further characterized.

siRNA library. At 120 h post transfection, proliferation
differences between ATR-proficient and -deficient cells
were assessed. This primary screen was independently
performed twice and generated 26 primary hits (9%),
which were again verified twice in the conformational
screen and classified into hit categories as selective ATR
genotype-dependent and ATR genotype-independent
proliferation inhibition, respectively, according to the
criteria described in the Material&Methods section.
Taken together, each candidate gene was validated based
on the average growth inhibition ratio of four independent
experiments. The top six gene targets displaying selective
ATR-genotype dependent proliferation inhibition are
summarized in Figure 1D and Table 1. The strongest
effect was observed for POLD1 (9-fold growth
inhibition ratio with an average relative survival of 5%
of ATRs/s cells) and therefore chosen for further in-depth
characterization.

RESULTS

Validation of synthetic lethality of ATR with
POLD1 in ATRs/s cells

ATR-genotype independent gene knockdowninduced detrimental effects on DLD1 cells
In addition to the identified synthetic lethal
interactions, siRNA-mediated knockdown of 20 genes
induced detrimental effects in DLD1 cells independent
of ATR-genotype (average relative survival between 6%
and 35% in parental and ATRs/s cells) (Table 2). Notably,
siRNA-mediated knockdown of XAB2 and PLK1 caused
a virtually complete loss of proliferation, extending the
known essential functions of these genes also to DLD1
colorectal cancer cells [26, 27].

siRNA library screening to identify synthetic
lethal interactions between ATR and DNA-repair
genes in DLD1 cells

To validate the synthetic lethal relationship of ATR
with POLD1, time- and dose-kinetics were performed
upon siRNA-mediated POLD1 depletion in ATRs/s cells.
The detrimental effects of POLD1 knockdown selectively
on ATRs/s cells were time-dependent, as shown by a
proliferation inhibition of at least 50%, starting at 96 h and
further peaking at 120 h post transfection, as compared
to mock- and untreated ATRs/s cells (Figure 2A). Efficient
siRNA-mediated POLD1 knockdown at 96 h post
transfection was confirmed on the protein level in parental
and ATRs/s cells (Figure 2B). Similarly, the effects of POLD1
knockdown on ATRs/s cells were dose-dependent, as shown
at 120 h post transfection by a proliferation inhibition of
at least 70% at concentrations ranging from 2.5 nM to 40
nM (Figure 2C). Expectedly, ATR-genotype independent
proliferation inhibition was observed in parental and ATRs/s
cells upon siPOLD1 treatment at higher and likely toxic
siRNA concentrations starting from 80 nM. Importantly,
clonally selected heterozygous ATR+/s cells also remained
unaffected by POLD1-knockdown, excluding artefacts due
to clonal variability (data not shown).

To identify potential synthetically lethal
interactions between ATR and certain DNA-repair
genes, we compared the effects of siRNA-mediated
knockdown of single genes on the proliferation rate of
ATR-proficient parental versus ATR-deficient ATRs/s
DLD1 cancer cells harboring the ATR knock-in Seckel
mutation [23], using a focused siRNA library directed
against 288 DNA repair genes each targeted by three
different siRNAs. Prior to screening, ATR deficiency
of ATRs/s cells was verified on the protein level by
demonstration of ATR protein suppression below the
detection limit of our assay (Figure 1A) and functionally
through confirmation of hypersensitivity towards the
DNA interstrand-crosslinking (ICL) agent mitomycin
C (MMC) (Figure 1B) [24, 25]. The experimental
screening design is schematically outlined in Figure 1C
and Figure 1D. In short, parental and ATRs/scells were
transfected simultaneously using a previously established

ratio 2-3) (Figure 3B, lower panel). To exclude a general
unspecific hypersensitivity phenotype, POLD1-depleted,
mock-transfected and control RKO, SW480 and LS513
cells were treated with MMC, oxaliplatin or 5-FU,
respectively. No significant differences in proliferation
rates were detected among POLD1-depleted, mocktransfected and control cells upon treatment with any of
these agents (Supplementary Figure S1).

To test whether the siPOLD1-mediated effects on
ATR-deficient DLD1 cells were reproducible through
chemical inhibition of ATR or its major downstream
effector kinase CHK1 in ATR-proficient DLD1 cells, the
ATR-inhibitors NU6027 and VE-822 as well as the rather
unselective but only currently FDA-approved CHK1inhibitor UCN-01 were applied. A significantly increased
sensitivity towards NU6027 (IC50 ratio 4), VE-822
(IC50 ratio 5) and UCN-01 (IC50 ratio 8) was observed
at 120 h selectively in POLD1-depleted as compared to
control or mock-transfected DLD1 cells (Figure 2D). To
exclude a general unspecific hypersensitivity phenotype,
POLD1-depleted and control DLD1 cells were treated
with commonly used chemotherapeutics including ICLand non-ICL-agents (MMC, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracile
(5-FU)). No significant proliferation differences among
POLD1-depleted, mock-transfected and control cells
were detected upon treatment with any of these agents
(Figure 2E).

siPOLD1-mediated apoptosis in ATRs/s
cancer cells
We next analyzed the mechanism underlying
POLD1 knockdown-mediated cell killing of ATR-deficient
cells. Cell cycle distribution and sub-G1 fraction were
assessed upon siPOLD1 transfection at 10 nM in parental
versus ATRs/s cells. No significant baseline differences
in cell cycle profiles or sub-G1 content were detected
among control-, mock- or siPOLD1-transfected cells
at 72 h (Figure 4A). In contrast, ATRs/s but not parental
DLD1 cells displayed a slightly increased sub-G1 fraction
at 96 h after siPOLD1-transfection (10%, data not
shown), which strongly increased at 120 h (40%) (Figure
4A+4B+4C). To further confirm apoptosis, cleaved Poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as well as the initiator
caspases CASPASE8, CASPASE9 and the central effector
CASPASE3 were assessed upon siPOLD1 transfection
at 96 h. Consistent with the increased sub-G1 fraction
of ATRs/s cells, cleavage of PARP, CASPASE3 and
CASPASE9 was observed selectively in ATRs/s but not in
parental cells (Figure 4D). In addition, caspase cascade
activity was determined by CASPASE3-dependent
cleavage of the fluorogenic CASPASE3-specific substrate
Ac-DEVD-AMC 96 h after siPOLD1-transfection.
POLD1-depleted ATRs/s cells exhibited a 6-fold increase in
DEVDase activity, corresponding to CASPASE3 activity,
whereas no significant DEVDase activity was observed in
parental cells (Figure 4E).

Generalization of siPOLD1-mediated
sensitization towards ATR- and CHK1-inhibitors
using a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines
In an effort to generalize our data beyond one
single cell line, we applied a panel of CRC cell lines.
After optimization and confirmation of efficient
POLD1 knockdown for each line (Figure 3A), the
cells were treated with NU6027, VE-822 or UCN-01,
respectively. As compared to control cells, POLD1
depletion sensitized RKO cells towards NU6027 (IC50
ratio 3) and VE-822 (IC50 ratio 2) (Figure 3B, upper
panel), SW480 cells towards NU6027 (IC50 ratio 2) and
UCN-01 (IC50 ratio 2) (Figure 3B, middle panel) and
LS513 cells towards all three inhibitors tested (IC50

was observed. In contrast, ATRs/s cells displayed a large

knock-in model of human CRC cells [23], we conducted
a siRNA library screening approach to identify potential
synthetically lethal interactions between ATR and certain
DNA-repair genes. We identified six DNA-repair genes
exhibiting synthetically lethal interactions with ATR
and 20 genes displaying ATR genotype-independent
knockdown-induced cell killing. Among the identified
genes exhibiting synthetically lethal interactions with ATR,
the most profound effects were observed for POLD1 and
further characterized.
ATR is an essential gene [33] and consequently, few
cellular models exist to investigate its complete disruption.
However, the bi-allelic hypomorphic ATR splice site
mutation 2101A→G, naturally found in Seckel syndrome
patients [34], results in subtotal ATR protein depletion
without significant effects on cancer cell growth or viability
[14, 22–24]. The human CRC line DLD1 engineered to
homozygously harbor this mutation (termed ATRs/s cells)
[14, 22–24] thus represents an ideally-suited model system
for our question, as subtotal ATR protein depletion likely

DISCUSSION
In response to DNA damage and replication stress,
ATR acts as central checkpoint regulator and mediator of
DNA-repair by homologous recombination [12]. ATRinhibition has recently been demonstrated to induce a
selective elimination of certain subsets of tumor cells
[14, 15] but the underlying genetic determinants are still
insufficiently defined. Using a well-defined genetic ATR

mimics the incomplete inhibition of ATR achievable
through pharmacological means more closely than the
complete and in most instances lethal ATR gene knockout
[33]. Preliminary experiments confirmed that DLD1
ATRs/s cells display suppression of ATR protein below the
detection limit of our assay as well as increased sensitivity
towards MMC, as previously described [23, 24].
In our screen, we identified 26 DNA-repair genes,
whose knockdown elicited either selective ATR genotypedependent or -independent detrimental effects. Hit rates
did not systematically differ between ATRs/s and ATRproficient cells (hit rate = 9%), ruling out the systematic
error of general siRNA-transfection-mediated cell killing of
ATR-deficient cells. In addition, the screening validity was
confirmed by a z factor of >0.5 [35]. The sensitivity of our
approach was illustrated by the correct re-identification of
the previously described synthetically lethal interactions
of XRCC1 or PRIM1 with ATR [17, 19]. In addition, very
recent data published during the writing of this manuscript
retrieved some of the hits obtained in our genetic ATR model,
including especially POLD1 and PRIM1, in a less ATRspecific synthetic lethal screen using ATR-inhibitors [36].
We identified six DNA-repair genes, whose
knockdown led to proliferation inhibition selectively of
ATRs/s but not of ATR-proficient cells (hit rate = 2%). In
addition, we found 20 genes, whose knockdown led to
proliferation inhibition independently of ATR status (hit
rate = 7%), indicating essential functions of these genes
at least in DLD1 cells. The strongest ATR genotypeindependent effects were observed for XAB2 and PLK1
knockdown, both of which resulted in a virtually complete
proliferation loss. Consistently, homozygous XAB2 and
PLK1 knockout mice display an early embryonic lethal
phenotype [26, 27] and knockdown of XAB2 was reported
to induce widespread cell death in human bladder, cervix
and pancreatic cancer [37].
The strongest effects selectively on DLD1 ATRs/s
cells were observed for POLD1 and PRIM1 knockdown,
both of which are involved in DNA replication synthesis
[38, 39]. POLD1 was further characterized as described
below. PRIM1 is the catalytic subunit of DNA primase
synthesizing short RNA primers, which are extended in
complex with DNA polymerase α [40]. A polymerase
switch to DNA polymerase δ harboring the catalytic and
proofreading subunit POLD1 ensures primer elongation
and DNA strand polymerization. Accordingly, both
proteins, PRIM1 and POLD1, are involved in immediately
consecutive DNA replication steps [41], explaining the
synthetically lethal effects upon depletion of either protein
in ATR-deficient cells. Mechanistically, RNA primer
synthesis influences replication-dependent binding of ATR
to chromatin, which is required for checkpoint activation.
Upon completion of DNA replication, dissociation
of ATR from DNA triggers entry into mitosis [42].
Impairment of either PRIM1 or POLD1 in combination
with ATR impairment might thus be expected to cause first
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

incomplete DNA replication, which is then followed by
premature entry into mitosis due to checkpoint deficiency.
In addition to POLD1 and PRIM1, we identified
XRCC5 (Ku80) and XRCC6 (Ku70) knockdown-induced
proliferation inhibition of ATRs/s cells. Next to the role of
XRCC5 and XRCC6 in non-homologous end joining DNA
repair [43], the XRCC5/XRCC6 heterodimer complex
associates with the essential factors MCM [44] and ORC
[45] to form the pre-replication complex. Consistently, low
expression levels of XRCC6 and XRCC5 lead to decreased
DNA synthesis due to abortive DNA replication initiation
[46], which in combination with impaired ATR-mediated
checkpoint signaling might be expected to cause synthetic
lethality between ATR and XRCC5/XRCC6 through
a similar mechanism as explained above. Clinically,
XRCC5 and XRCC6 single nucleotide polymorphisms as
well as epigenetic silencing of these genes can lead to the
development of multiple cancers, such as CRC, breast and
lung cancer [47]. It will be interesting to investigate in
future studies, whether XRCC5/XRCC6-impaired tumors
were sensitive towards ATR- or CHK1-inhibitors.
Clearly, additional studies are required to confirm
and mechanistically characterize the synthetic lethal
interactions between ATR and the genes identified in
our study. As a start, we picked POLD1 for in-depth
characterization, as its knockdown elicited by far the
strongest effects in ATRs/s cells. After confirmation of
time- and siPOLD1-concentration-dependent cell killing
specifically of ATRs/s cells, we demonstrated these effects
to be reproducible pharmacologically by using chemical
ATR-inhibitors on POLD1-depleted cells. Importantly,
a general hypersensitivity phenotype of POLD1depleted cells was excluded by treatment with various
chemotherapeutics including ICL- and non-ICL-agents,
none of which elicited POLD1-dependent hypersensitivity.
Intracellular protection against DNA damage
and replication stress is mediated by both ATR and
its downstream major effector kinase CHK1. Both
proteins are essential and appear to similarly promote
tumorigenesis [33, 48, 49]. As CHK1-inhibitors are
currently further developed than ATR-inhibitors [13] and
already undergoing testing in clinical trials [50], we asked,
whether the effects of ATR-inhibition could similarly be
induced by CHK1-inhibition. We applied the CHK1inhibitor UCN-01 for this purpose despite its rather low
selectivity, because it currently represents the only FDAapproved CHK1-inhibitor [50]. Importantly, UCN-01
caused comparable effects on POLD1-depleted cells as
did ATR-inhibitors. Nevertheless, ATR and CHK1 have
been demonstrated to not function completely epistatically
[51] and consequently, ATR- and CHK1-inhibitors are
not expected to be readily exchangeable. Besides the
canonical phosphorylation of CHK1 by ATR, multiple
other substrates are phosphorylated by ATR in various
tumor identities [11, 14, 52]. Vice versa, kinases other than
ATR have been demonstrated to mediate compensatory

but not in untransfected ATRs/s cells or untransfected or
transfected parental cells, strongly supporting an impaired or
at least decelerated DNA-repair capacity. These data further
support our above hypothesis that depletion of POLD1
causing increased DNA-damage [59] and decreased DNArepair in combination with deficient ATR-signaling causing
DNA replication checkpoint disruption [60], premature
entry into mitosis and eventually apoptosis mechanistically
explains the synthetic lethality of these two genes.
Importantly, previously reported genomesequencing data put our study in a direct clinical
context. A missense mutation (p.His506Arg) in the
exonuclease domain III of DNA polymerase δ, expected
to cause a hypermutability phenotype, has earlier been
identified in human CRC lines [62]. In addition, recently
described POLD1 missense mutations predispose to
CRC (p.Ser478Asn, p.Pro327Arg), endometrial cancer
(p.Ser478Asn) and likely to brain (p.Ser478Asn) and
kidney tumors (p.Val392Met) [63, 64]. Equivalent
mutations of the human POLD1 p.Ser478Arg lead to an
increased mutation rate in fission yeast and are mapped
along with the human POLD1 p.Pro327Arg mutation at
the interface of the exonuclease active site, predicting
these mutations to have functional effects on DNAbinding and exonuclease activity [64]. Thus, functional
genetic alterations of POLD1 could represent predictive
markers for therapeutic response towards ATR- and
CHK1-inhibitors in the clinical setting. However,
regarding colorectal cancer, at least 12 known CRC cell
lines have been reported to harbor either heterozygous or
homozygous mutations in POLD1 [65]. As many of these
mutations represent variants of unknown significance,
future studies applying suitable syngeneic POLD1 model
systems are urgently needed to clarify the functional
significance of these genetic changes in colorectal cancer
as well as other tumor entities.
In conclusion, ATR-inhibition induces the selective
elimination of certain cancer cell subsets [14, 15], but the
underlying genetic determinants remained insufficiently
defined. By screening of a DNA-repair gene siRNA library
in an ATR cancer cell model, we identified POLD1 as
one critical determinant during ATR inhibition-mediated
CRC cell killing. Currently ongoing whole-genome
sequencing studies are expected to additionally determine
the POLD1 mutation rates in tumor entities other than
CRC or endometrial cancer, which could then broaden
the applicability of the here proposed concept of a novel
tumor genotype-based anti-cancer therapy.

ATR-independent CHK1 activation [53]. Consequently,
inhibition of ATR as the upstream kinase of CHK1 is
expected to elicit additional and at least partly distinct
effects than CHK1-inhibition when applied for cancertherapeutic approaches.
In an effort to generalize our data beyond one
single cell line, we investigated the effects of ATR- and
CHK1-inhibitors in a panel of CRC cell lines, including
lines exhibiting a microsatellite instable (MSI) as well as
those exhibiting a chromosomal instable (CIN) phenotype
[54, 55]. POLD1-depleted RKO, SW480 and LS513 cells
all displayed increased sensitivity towards ATR-/CHK1inhibitors as compared to control cells. The fact that only
some but not all ATR-/CHK1-inhibitors elicited POLD1dependent effects might be ascribable to the additional
unspecific inhibition of other targets inherent to chemical
inhibitors along with the heterogeneous genotype of the
tested CRC lines. Nevertheless, inhibition of the ATR/
CHK1-axis could be a generalizable therapeutic concept
in patients with POLD1 low-or non-expressing tumors.
To investigate the underlying mechanism of the
synthetic lethal interaction between ATR and POLD1,
we analyzed cell cycle distribution to detect cell cycle
arrests along with the sub-G1 fraction as a surrogate
marker for apoptosis. While no significant effects on cell
cycle were observed, we found a significantly increased
sub-G1 fraction in ATRs/s cells upon POLD1 knockdown.
Apoptosis was further confirmed by the proteolytic
cleavages of PARP, the initiator CASPASE9 and the
executioner CASPASE3 [56] as well as by CASPASE3attributable DEVDase activity [57]. In general, these data
are consistent with previous studies showing spontaneous
apoptosis in vivo in POLD1-/- mice [58]. More specifically,
POLD1 downregulation has been demonstrated to mediate
the reduction of DNA synthesis in vitro [59], which is
expected to activate the DNA replication checkpoint [60].
Disruption of this checkpoint by ATR deficiency might
thus prevent cell cycle arrest in S-phase, a hypothesis
supported by the absence of cell cycle disturbances in our
experiments. Taken together, reduction of DNA synthesis
caused by POLD1 knockdown along with premature entry
into mitosis caused by ATR deficiency provides a plausible
mechanism for the apoptosis-mediated synthetic lethality
of POLD1 and ATR in our experiments.
Since POLD1 represents a DNA polymerase δ
subunit with critical catalytic and proofreading activity in
replicative DNA synthesis, recombination and especially
repair processes [38], we investigated the effects of POLD1
depletion on DNA damage- and DNA repair-kinetics in
ATR-proficient versus ATR-deficient cells. Upon POLD1
knockdown, ATRs/s cells but not parental cells displayed
strongly increased levels of endogenous DNA DSBs, as
illustrated by increased nuclear γ-H2AX focus formation
[61]. Upon exogenously induced DNA DSBs by IR,
sustained γ-H2AX focus accumulation (>120 h) was
observed specifically in siPOLD1-transfected ATRs/s cells,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
The human CRC cell lines DLD1, RKO, SW480
and LS513 were purchased from the European Collection
of Cell Cultures (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) or
7090

Oncotarget

the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Standards,
Wesel, Germany), respectively. DLD1 cells homozygously
harboring the hypomorphic Seckel mutation (ATRs/s)
have been described previously [14, 23, 24]. This
mutation causes a strongly reduced but not absent ATR
protein expression without significant impairment of
cell proliferation or survival [24]. All cell lines were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and
1% penicillin-streptomycin (PAA, Coelbe, Germany) and
incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

causing comparable growth inhibitions in parental and
ATRs/s cells were scored as “ATR genotype-independent”
hits. The average relative survival of parental and ATRs/s
cells, respectively, was calculated by the mean of four
individual growth inhibition values for each cell line from
three different oligonucleotides targeting one particular
gene. As preliminary experiments confirmed no relevant
proliferation differences between untreated and mocktreated cells, untreated cells were used as controls in the
following screening experiments.

Individual siPOLD1 transfection experiments

Reagents

Cells at 30%-50% confluence were transfected
in supplementary-free medium using Oligofectamine
and siRNA directed against POLD1 (QIAGEN) at
final concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 80 nM
or a non-coding sequence of β-galactosidase (βGAL,
Dharmacon Lafayette, Co, USA) at 50 nM or no
siRNA (mock). Transfection proceeded for 4 h before
adding serum-containing medium. The following
siRNA sequences were used: siPOLD1-1 (siPOLD1)
CGGGACCAGGGAGAATTAATA, siPOLD1-2 CAGTT
GGAGATTGACCATTAT, siPOLD1-3 CCGAGAGAG
CATGTTTGGGTA, siβGAL UUAUGCCGAUCGCGU
CACAUU.

MMC and UCN-01 were purchased from SigmaAldrich (Steinheim, Germany), LY2603618 from
Selleckchem (Munich, Germany), NU6027 from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany), VE-822 from MedKoo Bioscience
(Chapel Hill, NC, USA), 5-FU from Medac (Wedel,
Germany), and oxaliplatin from Accord Healthcare
(Freilassing, Germany).

siRNA library screening
A siRNA library was used containing 288 validated
DNA-repair genes each targeted by 3 validated siRNAs
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). 800 to 1,000 cells/well
were seeded in 96-well plates to reach confluence at day 7.
24 h later, transfection was performed in supplementaryfree medium with the respective siRNAs or no siRNA
at a final concentration of 10 nM using Oligofectamine
(Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) in OptiMEM (Gibco,
Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). 4 h after
transfection, serum-containing medium was added to the
cells. 120 h after transfection, cells were washed, lysed in
100 μL H2O, and 0.2% SYBR®Green (Lonza, Cologne,
Germany) was added. Fluorescence was measured using a
CytoFluor Series 4000 plate reader (PerseptiveBiosystems,
Framingham, MA, USA). Four independent siRNA library
screens were performed with each siRNA data point
reflecting triplicate wells. The growth inhibition was
determined by dividing each siRNA-treated value by the
average of 12 untreated control values for both parental
DLD1 and DLD1 ATRs/s cells. The growth inhibition
ratio was calculated by dividing the growth inhibition
value of parental DLD1 by the value of ATRs/s cells. The
mean growth inhibition ratio and the standard error of
the mean (SEM) were determined from four individual
growth inhibition ratio values that each represented
triplicates from three different oligonucleotides targeting
one particular gene. DNA-repair genes were classified
into hit categories defined as either “selective ATR
genotype-dependent” or “ATR genotype-independent”
proliferation inhibition. DNA-repair genes were scored
as “selective ATR genotype-dependent” hits if the mean
growth inhibition ratio was >1.50 and the average relative
survival of parental DLD1 cells was >0.45. Gene targets

Cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation assays were performed over
a broad range of concentrations covering 100% to
0% cell survival. 800 to 3,000 cells/well were plated
in 96-well plates to reach confluence on day 7. After
settling, the cells were incubated with various drugs
at multiple concentrations. Following incubation for
120 h, the cells were washed, lysed in 100 μL H2O
and 0.2% SYBR®Green was added. Fluorescence was
measured using a CytoFluor Series 4000 plate reader
and growth inhibition was calculated as compared to the
untreated control samples. At least, three independent
experiments were performed per drug, with each data
point reflecting triplicate wells. Error bars represent
SEM of three experiments, independently performed in
triplicates.

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed and protein extracts boiled and
loaded on 8% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis,
proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, which
were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk powder before primary
antibody was applied at 4 °C overnight. The membranes
were washed and stained with secondary antibody.
Enhanced chemo-luminescence was elicited using
ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific,
Schwerte, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The following primary antibodies
7091

were used: anti-CASPASE3, anti-CASPASE8, antiCASPASE9, anti-PARP (all Cell Signaling Technology,
Boston, MA, USA); anti-POLD1 (sc-8797, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). Anti-β-ACTIN
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) served as loading control.
The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-goat
HRP-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
anti-mouse and anti-rat HRP-conjugated antibody (GE
Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany).

96 h, the cells were prepared in lysis buffer containing
0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 84 mM
KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1
mM DTT, 5 g/ml aprotinin, 1 g/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Caspase activity
of 20 μg cell lysate was determined with 50 μM of the
fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (N-acetyl-AspGlu-Val-Asp-aminomethyl-coumarin, Biomol, Hamburg,
Germany) as described before [57]. Concomitant treatment
of cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) at 25 ng/
ml and actinomycinD (AcD) at 200 ng/ml for 6 h was used
as positive control [67, 68]. Error bars represent SEM of
two experiments, independently performed in triplicates.

Nuclear γ-H2AX focus formation assay
Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates.
At 60% confluence, the cells were irradiated at a dose
of 4 Gy using a RS225 γ-ray tube (X-Strahl, Camberley,
Great Britain). Consecutively, treated cells were washed,
fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde and for 1 min in
methanol. After permeabilization in TBS/0.5% Triton
X-100 and blocking in TBS/2% BSA/0.5% Triton X-100,
cells were incubated with an anti-phospho- H2AX antibody
(mouse monoclonal, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., NY,
USA) for 2 h. Afterwards, the cells were washed and
incubated with Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse antibody
(Invitrogen) for 2 h. After washing, nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) at
10 μg/ml. Slides were mounted with VECTASHIELD
mounting medium (Burlingame, CA, USA) and analyzed
using a Zeiss AxioVision fluorescent microscopy (CarlZeiss, Jena, Germany) and the AxioVision Re.4.8
software (Carl-Zeiss). Exposure time and settings were
kept constant for all samples in individual experiments.
At least 50 cells were scored for each cell line and each
condition, applying two independent experiments. Error
bars represent SEM.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Error bars represent SEM of at least three experiments,
except for the fluorometric assays for caspase activity
and the γ-H2AX focus formation assays, which were
performed twice. FACS data were statistically interpreted
using a paired Student’s t-test. P-values **p < 0.01 were
considered statistically significant.
