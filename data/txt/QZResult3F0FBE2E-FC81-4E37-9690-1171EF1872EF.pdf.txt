Abstract

Author Manuscript

Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly malignant brain tumor that occurs primarily in children.
Although surgery, radiation and high-dose chemotherapy have led to increased survival, many MB
patients still die from their disease, and patients who survive suffer severe long-term side effects
as a consequence of treatment. Thus, more effective and less toxic therapies for MB are critically
important. Development of such therapies depends in part on identification of genes that are
necessary for growth and survival of tumor cells. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein
(IAP) that regulates cell cycle progression and resistance to apoptosis, is frequently expressed in
human MB, and when expressed at high levels predicts poor clinical outcome. Therefore, we
hypothesized that Survivin may play a critical role in growth and survival of MB cells and that
targeting it may enhance MB therapy. Here we show that Survivin is overexpressed in tumors
from patched (Ptch) mutant mice, a model of Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven MB. Genetic deletion
of survivin in Ptch mutant tumor cells significantly inhibits proliferation and causes cell cycle
arrest. Treatment with small molecule antagonists of Survivin impairs proliferation and survival of
both murine and human MB cells. Finally, Survivin antagonists impede growth of MB cells in
vivo. These studies highlight the importance of Survivin in SHH-driven MB, and suggest that it
may represent a novel therapeutic target in patients with this disease.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children(1). Intensive
therapy – including surgery, cranio-spinal radiation and high dose chemotherapy – has
improved 5-year survival rates(2), but almost a third of MB patients still die from their
disease, and survivors suffer severe long term side effects that affect their quality of life(3).
Thus, safer and more effective therapies are needed for this disease.

Author Manuscript

In recent years, targeted therapies have begun to be evaluated in patients with MB. For
example, with the recognition that a subset of MBs results from mutations in the Sonic
Hedgehog (SHH) pathway(4), antagonists of Smoothened (SMO), an activator of the
pathway, have advanced into clinical trials for the disease. Although initial reports suggested
that these agents can inhibit tumor growth(5), as with many targeted therapies, resistance
develops quickly(6). Moreover, patients who have SHH pathway mutations downstream of
SMO do not respond to these agents at all(7). Thus, even for SHH-driven MBs, additional
approaches are necessary.
Finding novel therapeutic targets for MB depends on identification of genes that are critical
for tumor growth and survival. SURVIVIN (also known as baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis

repeat-containing 5, or BIRC5), is a member of the IAP family that regulates both cell cycle
progression and cell survival(8, 9). SURVIVIN is expressed in many human cancers, and its
expression is correlated with poor clinical outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
(10), breast cancer(11), leukemia(12, 13), neuroblastoma(14) and glioma(15). Because of its
high expression in tumors and minimal expression in most adult tissues(16), a number of
approaches have been developed to inhibit its expression and function. These include small
molecule antagonists, antisense oligonucleotides, and immunotherapy(17-21). Some of these
approaches are in clinical trials for numerous cancers, including prostate cancer(22),
melanoma(23, 24), breast cancer(25), and NSCLC(25, 26).

Author Manuscript

SURVIVIN has not been studied extensively in the context of MB. Although some studies
have suggested that elevated expression is linked to poor prognosis(27-29), little is known
about its role in MB growth and survival. Using an animal model of SHH-driven MB, we
now show that Survivin is highly expressed in tumors and absent from normal adult
cerebellum. Moreover, through both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition we
demonstrate that Survivin is critical for proliferation and survival of mouse and human SHH
driven MB cells. Finally, Survivin antagonists impair growth of MB in vivo, highlighting
the potential of Survivin as a therapeutic target in patients with MB.

Results
Survivin is highly expressed in medulloblastomas from Ptch mutant mice

Author Manuscript

To determine whether Survivin could represent a target in SHH driven MB, we isolated
RNA from Ptch mutant tumors and examined survivin expression using real time PCR. High
levels of survivin were detected in all tumors and in granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the
progenitors from which these tumors are thought to arise(30) (Figure 1A). Importantly,
expression could not be detected in normal adult cerebellum. Similar results were seen when
Survivin protein was examined by immunoblotting (Figure 1B). Staining of tissue sections
revealed Survivin expression in the nuclei of tumor cells (abrogated by blocking peptide
(Figure 1D)), and minimal staining in normal adult cerebellum (Figure 1C-F). These data
indicate that Survivin is highly expressed in Ptch mutant tumors, raising the possibility that
it might play an important role in tumor growth or maintenance.
Survivin is critical for MB cell proliferation and cell cycle progression

Author Manuscript

To investigate the importance of Survivin for growth of MB cells, we first utilized a genetic
approach. Survivinfl/fl mice(31), in which the survivin gene is flanked by loxP sites, were
crossed with Ptch+/- mice, to generate tumors in which survivin can be deleted by Cre
recombinase. We confirmed efficient deletion of survivin by isolating tumor cells from
Survivinfl/fl;Ptch+/- (SP) mice and infecting them with Cre retroviruses. After 48hrs, survivin
expression was significantly reduced (by 82%) in Cre-infected cells compared to control
(GFP-infected) cells (Figure 2A). We then looked at the effect of survivin loss on
proliferation. After Cre-mediated deletion of survivin from SP tumor cells, thymidine
incorporation was decreased by almost 90% (Figure 2B). Importantly, when tumor cells
from SurvivinWT mice were infected with Cre viruses, there was no appreciable difference in
proliferation compared to control cells (Figure 2C), indicating that the decreased thymidine

incorporation observed in SP tumor cells was not due to non-specific toxicity of the Cre
virus. To address whether loss of survivin affects cell cycle progression, we isolated cells
from SP tumors, infected them with Cre or GFP viruses, and performed cell cycle analysis
(Figure 2D,E). survivin deletion led to a marked accumulation of cells in the G2/M phases of
the cell cycle (39% of Cre-infected cells vs. 9.5% of control cells in G2/M). Together, these
data demonstrate that Survivin is necessary for proliferation and cell cycle progression of
MB cells.
Survivin antagonists inhibit MB cell proliferation and promote apoptosis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Given the importance of Survivin for MB proliferation, we hypothesized that
pharmacological agents that inhibit Survivin expression or function might interfere with
tumor growth. To test this, we obtained several small molecule Survivin antagonists:
YM155 is an inhibitor of survivin transcription(32), whereas S12 and LLP3 bind directly to
Survivin protein and interfere with its function(33, 34). To test the ability of YM155 to
inhibit survivin expression in Ptch mutant MB cells, we treated cells with the drug for 48hrs,
isolated RNA and performed qRT-PCR for survivin. YM155 markedly decreased survivin
expression even at a concentration of 10 nM (Supp. Figure 1A). Similarly, loss of Survivin
was detected at the protein level using western blotting (Supp Figure 1B). These data
suggest that YM155 effectively inhibits survivin expression in Ptch mutant MB cells. To test
the effects of Survivin antagonists on MB growth, we treated tumor cells with these agents
and analyzed the percentage of cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67. Consistent
with our genetic results, inhibition of Survivin using either YM155 or S12 caused a
significant decrease in the number of Ki67+ cells compared to treatment with vehicle
(DMSO) (Figure 3A-D). Additionally, we saw a dose dependent decrease in thymidine
incorporation after treatment with YM155, S12, or LLP3 (Figure 3E-F and Supp. Figure 2).
These data suggest that Survivin antagonists effectively inhibit MB growth in vitro.
To determine whether Survivin antagonists also cause cell cycle arrest in MB cells, we
performed cell cycle analysis. After 24hrs, cells treated with S12 showed a significant
accumulation in G2/M (56%) compared to cells treated with vehicle (12%) (Figure 4A,C).
G2/M accumulation was also seen at 36h (52%) (Figure 4B,D). In contrast to S12, YM155
decreased the percentage of cells in G2/M (7%), with a concomitant increase in S phase
(from 15 to 20% at 24hr) (Figure 4E-H). Notwithstanding these differences, our data
demonstrate that both Survivin antagonists alter normal cell cycle progression of MB cells.

Author Manuscript

In addition to its role in regulating cell cycle progression, Survivin has been suggested to
function as an inhibitor of apoptosis. To determine if Survivin inhibition promotes MB cell
apoptosis, tumor cells were treated with Survivin antagonists and then stained with AnnexinV and propidium iodide (PI). As shown in Figure 4E-G, antagonists increased the
percentage of apoptotic (AnnexinV+) tumor cells from 21% (after DMSO treatment) to 62%
(S12) or 59% (YM155). These data show that Survivin antagonists are not merely cytostatic,
but can promote apoptosis of tumor cells as well.
To verify that Survivin antagonists were not inducing non-specific toxicity, we tested their
effects on GNPs, which express survivin (see Figure 1), and post-mitotic neurons, which do
not. Treatment of GNPs with YM155 or S12 caused a dose dependent increase in the

percentage of dead cells (as measured by EthD1 staining). In contrast, survival of postmitotic neurons was not affected by treatment with Survivin antagonists (Supp. Fig 3A,B).
These data suggest that Survivin antagonists induce death of Survivin-expressing cells but
are not toxic to normal cerebellar neurons.
Survivin antagonists cooperate with radiation and SHH antagonists

Author Manuscript

Among the major drawbacks of current MB therapy are the devastating side effects of
radiation(35, 36). Since recent studies have suggested that YM155 can enhance the efficacy
of radiotherapy against NSCLC(37), we hypothesized that combining radiation and Survivin
antagonists might be effective for MB as well. To test this, we performed thymidine
incorporation assays on tumor cells treated with Survivin antagonists for 24hr followed by
exposure to varying doses of radiation (Figure 5A). Treatment with sub-optimal doses of
YM155 and S12 alone resulted in a small decrease in proliferation. The combination of
Survivin antagonists and 0.25 grey (Gy) radiation markedly decreased tumor cell
proliferation compared to radiation alone. The level of inhibition achieved with the
combination treatment was equivalent to that achieved by doubling the radiation dose. These
data suggest that Survivin antagonists can enhance the effects of radiation on MB cells, and
raise the possibility that these agents might allow reduction in the doses of radiation used for
therapy.

Author Manuscript

In addition to conventional therapy, targeted therapies have begun to be evaluated for
treatment MB. For SHH-associated tumors, NVP-LDE225 a small molecule antagonist of
SMO, has shown some efficacy in animal models as well as in patients(38, 39). To test
whether Survivin antagonists increase the efficacy of SHH antagonists, we treated Ptch
mutant tumor cells with various concentrations of LDE225 alone or in combination with
10μg/ml S12 (Figure 5B). LDE225 alone had an IC50 of 5.5 nM (range: 3-8.5 nM) while the
combination of LDE225 and S12 markedly decreased the IC50 to 0.04 nM (range: 0.04-2
nM). Similarly, exposure to 20 nM YM155 decreased the IC50 of LDE225 (from 13.5nM to
6.4nM). These data suggest that Survivin antagonists significantly enhance growth
inhibition by LDE.
Survivin antagonists inhibit growth of human SHH-driven MB cells

Author Manuscript

The studies described above focused on murine SHH-associated MB. To determine whether
human SHH-driven MB cells also respond to Survivin antagonists, we used patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs) from SHH-driven tumors. Real time PCR analysis revealed that PDX
cells express high levels of survivin (Supplementary Figure 4). Treatment of PDX cells with
Survivin antagonists in vitro led to significant decreases in 3H-thymidine incorporation
(Figure 6A-C). Tumor cells were also treated with the SMO antagonist LDE225. Notably,
the PDX line with a mutation upstream of SMO7 (DMB-012) was responsive to LDE225
(Figure 6A, left panel and ref(40)) whereas the lines with mutations downstream of
SMO(40),(41) (RCMB-018 and ICb-984MB) were resistant (Figure 6B,C). In contrast, all
three lines responded robustly to YM155 and high dose S12. These data suggest that
Survivin antagonists can inhibit the growth of human SHH-driven MBs and that they may
be useful for treating tumors that are resistant to SMO antagonists.

Survivin antagonists inhibit MB growth in vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Given the ability of Survivin antagonists to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of
tumor cells in vitro, we questioned whether inhibiting Survivin could prevent tumor growth
in vivo. Unfortunately, published reports (60) as well as our own preliminary studies
suggested that these antagonists do not accumulate in the brain or intracranial tumors.
Therefore, Ptch mutant tumors were implanted into the flanks of Nu/Nu mice and treated
with YM155 or vehicle. Intratumoral injections of YM155 significantly decreased tumor
growth compared to treatment with vehicle (Fig7A). Tumors harvested after 6 weeks of
treatment were much smaller than those in the vehicle treated mice (Fig7B, C). We also
tested whether systemic treatment with YM155 could inhibit tumor growth in vivo; since
YM155 has a short half-life, we used osmotic pumps for delivery(20, 32, 42). Nu/Nu mice
bearing Ptch mutant flank tumors were implanted with micro-osmotic pumps to
continuously infuse YM155 or vehicle (saline) for 3 weeks. Tumors in mice with YM155containing pumps grew significantly less than those in mice with vehicle pumps (Fig 7D-F).
These data suggest that Survivin antagonists can potently inhibit MB growth in vivo.

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that Survivin is expressed in human MB, and that its
expression is correlated with poor outcome. To study the role of Survivin in MB growth and
survival, we used a mouse model of MB driven by activation of the SHH pathway. Our
studies demonstrate that Survivin is highly expressed in SHH-driven MB and that genetic
and pharmacologic inhibition of Survivin impedes growth of MB cells in vitro and in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Our initial studies demonstrated that Survivin is expressed at high levels in Ptch mutant MB
cells and not in normal adult cerebellum, suggesting that it might represent a cancerselective target. To test the functional importance of Survivin in MB cells, we used Cre
viruses to delete Survivin from Survivinf/flx;Ptch+/- tumor cells. Loss of Survivin resulted in
markedly decreased proliferation and arrest in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. These
results are consistent with the function of Survivin as a member of the chromosomal
passenger complex, which is critical for alignment of chromosomes during metaphase and
for successful cell cleavage(43, 44). In addition, previous studies have shown that loss of
Survivin leads to aberrant mitosis, centrosome amplification and failed cytokinesis in a
number of cancers, including glioma and cervical cancer(45, 46). Thus, in MB as in other
tumors, Survivin seems to be critical for normal proliferation and cell cycle progression.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate Survivin's utility as a therapeutic target, we used small molecule antagonists.
Consistent with our genetic studies, Survivin antagonists significantly decreased
proliferation and altered cell cycle progression. Interestingly, while S12 treatment caused
accumulation of cells in G2/M phase (similar to survivin deletion), YM155 caused cells to
accumulate in S-phase. This observation is consistent with previous studies that
demonstrated YM155 treatment can cause a loss of new DNA synthesis and concomitant
stall in S phase(47). This discrepancy between S12 and YM155 could be due to differences
in the kinetics or degree of Survivin inhibition induced by these drugs. Alternatively, it
could result from differences in the mechanisms by which the drugs act: whereas S12 binds
directly to Survivin protein(33), YM155 inhibits survivin expression by disrupting ILF3/

NF110 complexes(48, 49) or Sp1 binding at the survivin promoter(50). Thus, in addition to
potently decreasing survivin expression (see Ref #32 and sup fig 1), YM155 may also alter
expression of other genes that regulate cell cycle progression (e.g. cyclin D1, p27) (51, 52),
and thereby cause arrest at earlier stages of the cycle. Nonetheless, the fact that genetic
deletion and several small molecule inhibitors all interfere with cell cycle progression in
Ptch mutant tumor cells strongly supports the notion that Survivin is required for this
process in SHH-driven MB.

Author Manuscript

In addition to their effects on the cell cycle, Survivin antagonists also increased the
percentage of MB cells undergoing apoptosis. It remains unclear whether loss of Survivin
function causes apoptosis directly or as a consequence of cell cycle arrest. Analysis of
Annexin+ cells after treatment with Survivin antagonists showed that apoptosis is not
detectable until 36hr, whereas cell cycle inhibition is observed by 12-24hr. These results are
consistent with the notion that apoptosis occurs secondary to cell cycle arrest. The fact that
Survivin antagonists not only inhibit proliferation but also cause death of tumor cells may
make them potent therapeutic agents for MB.
Previous studies of glioma and other cancers have suggested that targeting Survivin can
enhance the effects of radiation and chemotherapy(20, 37, 53-58). In agreement with these
data, we found that Survivin antagonists significantly enhanced the sensitivity of MB cells
to radiation. Combining low dose radiation (0.25 grey) with S12 or YM155 was as effective
at inhibiting tumor growth as doubling the dose of radiation. These data suggest that
addition of Survivin antagonists may allow children to be treated with lower doses of
radiation without decreasing therapeutic benefits. The approach could markedly reduce
treatment-related side effects and improve the long term quality of life of MB patients.

A major advance in treatment of SHH driven MB has been the development of SMO
antagonists. However, one drawback of these agents is the swift acquisition of resistance to
the drug and tumor recurrence. Our studies show that combining LDE225 and Survivin
antagonists significantly enhanced inhibition of proliferation compared to either drug alone.
Although in these studies we focused on co-treatment, it would be interesting to look at the
ability of Survivin antagonists to overcome LDE225 resistance. In this context, it is notable
that in non-small cell lung cancer, downregulation of Survivin by either siRNA or treatment
with YM155 reverses Erlotinib resistance(59). It is also important to note that LDE225 and
other SHH antagonists work at the level of SMO, and are thus ineffective for patients with
mutations downstream in the SHH pathway(7). We show that human PDX cells with such
downstream mutations are still sensitive to inhibition by Survivin antagonists. In addition,
our preliminary studies suggest that that YM155 can inhibit growth of non-SHH-associated
MB cells (data not shown). These studies raise the possibility that Survivin may be a
therapeutic target for a broad spectrum of MB patients.
Lastly, we have shown that YM155 can inhibit tumor growth in vivo, either by direct
intratumoral injection or systemic administration. These data strongly suggest that targeting
Survivin could be an effective approach for treating MB. Unfortunately, pharmacokinetic
studies by our lab and others ((60) and data not shown) suggest that the Survivin antagonists
we have tested do not show significant accumulation in the brain or in intracranial tumors.

Thus, chemical modification of these agents, or alternative modes of delivery (e.g.
convection-enhanced(61, 62) or intrathecal delivery(63, 64)) may be necessary to make
these agents useful for treatment of MB and other brain tumors.

Materials and Methods
Mice

Author Manuscript

Survivinfl/fl (31), Ptcfl/fl (65), Math1-Cre-ER(66)' Ptch +/-(67), and Math1CreER;ptcfl/fl (30)
(MERP) mice have been described previously. P4 MERP pups were gavaged with 0.8g/40μl
of tamoxifen (T-5648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in corn oil to generate tumors. Tumors from
Ptch+/- and MERP mice were used for experiments. To allow for deletion of survivin in
tumor cells, Survivinfl/fl mice were crossed with Ptch+/- mice to generate the Survivin fl/fl;
Ptch+/- (SP) line. CD-1 Nu/Nu mice were from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington,
MA). P7 wild type C57BL/6 pups were obtained from the SBMRI Animal Facility. All mice
were maintained in the Animal Facility, and experiments were performed in accordance with
national guidelines and regulations, and with the approval of the SBMRI Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Cell isolation and in vitro culture

Author Manuscript

GNPs were isolated from P7 cerebellum and tumors from adult cerebellum as previously
described(30, 68). Briefly, tissue was digested in a solution containing 10 U/ml papain
(Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) and 250 U/ml DNase (Sigma), and
triturated to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells were spun through a 35-65% Percoll
gradient (GE Healthcare Uppsala, Sweden) to purify GNPs and tumor cells. Cells were
cultured in NB/NS-21 media (Neurobasal media, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glut,
penicillin/streptomycin and NS-21 supplement, plus 1% FBS (Invitrogen Grand Island,
NY)) on growth factor-reduced (GFR) matrigel-coated plates (1:50 in NB/NS-21, BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA).
Real-Time PCR

Author Manuscript

For analysis of survivin expression, mRNA was isolated from cells and tissues using an
RNAeasy Plus Mini kit (QIAGEN Inc, Valencia, CA). One-step qRT-PCR reactions were
performed in triplicate using QuantiTech RT mix (QIAGEN) on the Bio-Rad C1000
Thermocycler and CFX96 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Duplicate
reactions were prepared without reverse transcriptase to confirm the absence of genomic
DNA contamination. Relative gene expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method and
normalized to Actin. 95% confidence intervals for each sample were calculated using the
sum of the squares method. To evaluate the efficiency of survivin deletion by Cre infection,
SP tumor cells were isolated, infected with Cre-IRES-GFP or GFP retroviruses for 48hrs,
sorted for GFP expression, and analyzed as outlined above.
Immunohistochemistry
For staining of paraffin-embedded tissue, animals were perfused with PBS followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA, Affymetrix, cat# 19943). Cerebella were removed, fixed in 4%
PFA overnight and delivered to the SBMRI Histology Shared Resource for embedding,

(Cell Signaling Technology Cat#2808S, Danvers, MA) alone or anti-Survivin antibodies
pre-incubated with Survivin blocking peptides (Cell Signaling Technology Cat #1037).
Cell Lysis and Western-blotting

Author Manuscript

To evaluate Survivin expression, tumor cells, GNPs and adult cerebellum were lysed in
RIPA buffer (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Protein was quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein
assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, blocked with 5% BSA
(Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), and stained with anti-Survivin
or GAPDH antibodies overnight (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 2808S, 5174)
followed by anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 Cell Signaling
technology, Cat# 7074S). Proteins were visualized by incubating with Pierce ECL plus
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). To evaluate Survivin expression after YM155
treatment, tumor cells were plated on 6-well plates (6-8M cells/well) and treated with
YM155 or DMSO (Fisher Scientific Inc. San Diego, CA) at 1 μM for 24hrs and processed as
described above.
Analysis of proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis
To analyze the effects of Survivin loss, cells were isolated from SP tumors and infected with
Cre-IRES-GFP or GFP retroviruses (MSCV, 1:5 in media). To assess the effects of
pharmacological inhibition of Survivin, Ptch mutant tumor cells were treated with YM155
(Selleck Chemicals), S12(33), LLP3(34), or DMSO (Fisher Scientific) at the indicated
concentrations.

viability was analyzed using the LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Invitrogen).
Briefly, cells were stained with 4μM EthD1 for 40 min and fluorescence emission (645 nM)
was measured using a TECAN infiniteM200 Microplate reader (Morrisville, NC). The
second plate was maintained in differentiation media (NB/NS-21 containing 25mM glucose
and 25mM potassium chloride) for 5 days to produce post-mitotic neurons. Cells were then
treated with DMSO or corresponding doses of YM155 and cell viability was evaluated after
48hrs.
Radiation and LDE225 treatment

Author Manuscript

To measure effects of inhibitors in combination with radiation, tumor cells were plated in
96-well plates at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells per well and cultured in the presence of DMSO,
50 nM YM155, or 10 ug/ml S12. After 24hrs, cells were subjected to 0, 0.25, or 0.5 Gy
radiation using a Gammacell 40 Exactor (Low-dose cesium 137 irradiator, Best Theratronics
Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Cells were cultured for an additional 24 hr, and
[methyl-3H]thymidine assays were performed as described above.
To measure effects of inhibitors in combination with the SHH antagonist NVP-LDE225
(Selleck Chemicals, S2151), tumor cells were plated in 96 well plates at 0.2 × 106 cells/well
and cultured with increasing doses of LDE225 or a single dose of Survivin antagonist
(10μg/ml S12, 20nM YM255) alone or in combination with LDE225 as indicated. Cells
were cultured for 48hrs and [methyl-3H]thymidine assays were performed as described
above.
Human tumor isolation, propagation, and classification

Author Manuscript

Human MB tissue for patient-derived xenografts was obtained from surgical resection of
tumors at Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC), Rady Children's Hospital (San
Diego, CA) or Texas Children's Cancer Center (Houston, TX). All procedures using human
tissue were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the respective institutions. Upon
retrieval, the tissue was mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, then
immediately injected into the cerebella of NSG mice. When mice showed signs of MB,
tumors were again dissociated into single-cell suspensions and re-transplanted back into the
cerebella of naïve hosts to establish a propagated line for each patient-derived xenograft.
Molecular classification of human tumors was previously described(7, 40, 41)

Flank tumor implantation and in vivo antagonist treatment

Author Manuscript

Cells isolated from tumors were re-suspended 1:1 in NB/NS-21 media and GFR-matrigel.
100μl of cell suspension (6-7 × 106 cells) was injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 5-8
week old CD-1 Nu/Nu mice. Tumor growth was monitored using calipers and tumor volume
calculated using the formula 0.52*length*width2. Treatment was initiated when tumors
reached ∼100 mm3. For intratumoral injections, tumors were injected twice a week with
YM155 (20 μM final concentration) or vehicle (20% DMSO in saline). For systemic
treatments, mice were treated with 10 mg/kg/day YM155 or saline by subcutaneous microosmotic pump (Alzet, model D2004). Experimental treatments were continued until control
tumors reached maximum size of 2000mm3, at which point tumors were collected for
analysis.
Statistics

Author Manuscript

Unless otherwise indicated, statistics were calculated by ANOVA with post hoc student's ttest. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant and marked with asterisks where
appropriate.

Figure 1. Survivin is expressed in Ptch mutant tumors

RNA and protein from Ptch mutant MB cells, P7 GNPs and adult cerebellum were analyzed
for Survivin expression using real time PCR (A) and by western blotting (B). Survivin is
highly expressed in tumors and GNPs, but not in adult cerebellum. Error bars in (A)
represent 95% confidence interval calculated using sum of the squares method (p<0.02 by
ANOVA and post hoc student's t-test). (C-F) Tissue sections from Ptch mutant tumor and
normal adult cerebellum were stained with anti-Survivin antibodies alone (C,E) or with antiSurvivin antibodies that were pre-incubated for 30 min with Survivin blocking peptide

Figure 2. Loss of Survivin causes decreased proliferation and cell cycle arrest

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

(A-B) Cells were isolated from Survivinfl/fl;Ptch+/- tumors and infected with Cre- or GFP
retroviruses for 48 hr. (A) GFP+ cells were isolated by flow cytometry and survivin mRNA
expression analyzed by RT-qPCR (n=2). Cre causes loss of survivin expression (p<0.02).
(B) Cells were pulsed with 3H-thymidine for 12 hr, harvested, and analyzed for
incorporation. Loss of survivin leads to decreased tumor cell proliferation (p<0.001). Data
are representative of 5 experiments. (C) Cells were isolated from Ptch+/- tumor (wild type
for survivin), infected with Cre- or GFP viruses for 48 hr, and collected after 12 hr pulse
with 3H-thymidine to measure incorporation. Infection with Cre virus alone does not
significantly impair proliferation (p>0.1). Data in (A-C) represent mean +/- standard
deviation (SD) and are representative of 4 experiments. (D, E) Cells from
Survivinfl/fl;Ptch+/- tumors were infected with virus as described above (D. GFP, E. Cre
virus) and stained with 7-AAD for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. survivin deletion
causes accumulation of cells in G2/M. Data are representative of 4 experiments and cell
cycle percentages based on live cell gates (excluded subG1). p values calculated using
student's t-test.

Figure 3. Survivin antagonists inhibit proliferation

Author Manuscript

(A-D) Tumor cells were plated on chamber slides and treated for 24 hr with control media
(A), 0.1% DMSO (B), 10 μg/ml S12 (C), or 50 nM YM155 (D). Cells were stained with
anti-Ki67 antibodies (green) to mark proliferating cells and DAPI (blue) to label cell nuclei.
Very few cells were Ki67+ after treatment with Survivin antagonists compared to controls
(p<0.0001 for YM155 and S12). Data are representative of 3 experiments. (E-F) Ptch mutant
tumor cells were treated with multiple doses of YM155 (E) or S12 (F) for 48 hr and pulsed
with 3H-thymidine for 12 hr to measure proliferation. Treatment with either antagonist
decreased proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (p< 0.02 for all YM155 and S12 doses
except 5μg/ml S12, which was not significant (NS)). Ki67+ percentages in (A) were
averaged from 6 images for each treatment. Data in (E-F) represent mean +/- SD and are
representative of 6 experiments. Stats were calculated by ANOVA and post hoc student's ttests.

Figure 4. Survivin antagonists alter cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis

(A-H) Ptch mutant tumor cells were treated with either DMSO (A,B,E,F), 20 μg/ml S12
(C,D), or 100 nM YM155 (G,H) and stained with 7-AAD for cell cycle analysis after 24 hr
(A,C,E,G) or 36 hr (B,D,F,H). YM155 decreased the percentage of cells in G2/M, while S12
treatment caused an accumulation of cells in G2/M. Data represent 4 (A-D) and 6 (E-H)
experiments and percentages based on live cell gates (excluded subG1). (I-K) Tumor cells
were treated with DMSO (I), 20 μg/ml (J), or 100nM YM155 (K) for 36 hr, then collected
and stained with Propidium Iodide (PI) and Annexin-V for FACS analysis. The percentage
of apoptotic cells was significantly higher after antagonist treatment compared to control.
Data represent 6 independent experiments.

Figure 5. Survivin antagonists cooperate with radiation and LDE225 SHH antagonists

Author Manuscript

A) Tumor cells were treated with either 0.1% DMSO, 50 nM YM155, or 10 μg/ml S12 for
24 hr, and then irradiated with 0, 0.25, or 0.5 gray (Gy). After 24 hr, cells were pulsed
with 3H-thymidine and assayed for incorporation. Treatment with antagonists enhanced
sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation (p<0.02 for all treatments, calculated by 2 way
ANOVA to identify radiation dose by treatment interaction, split by radiation dose, with
post hoc student's t-tests) Data are representative of 5 experiments. (B,C) Tumor cells were
plated in 96 well plates and treated with LDE225 alone (at the indicated concentrations) or
in combination with 20 nM YM155 (B) or 10 μg/ml S12 (C). Cells were pulsed with 3Hthymidine after 48 hr and harvested to assay levels of incorporation. Combination treatment
of LDE with either S12 or YM155 significantly lowered the IC50 compared to LDE alone
(p< 0.01 by student's t-test). Data are representative of 4 (B) and 3 (C) experiments. All data
represent mean +/- SD.

Figure 6. Survivin antagonists inhibit proliferation of human SHH-driven MB cells

Cells isolated from LDE225-sensitive xenograft DMB012 (A) and LDE-insensitive
xenografts RCMB018 (B) and ICb-984MB (C) were treated for 48 hr with DMSO, LDE225,
YM155 or S12, and analyzed for thymidine incorporation following a 12-16 hr pulse. All
tumor cells were sensitive to YM155 inhibition and high dose S12 treatment (DMB012
p<0.01 for all doses including LDE225, RCM018 and ICb-984MB p<0.03 for YM155 and
10μg/ml S12 while LDE and 20μg/ml S12 were not significant with p>0.08). All stats were
calculated by ANOVA and post hoc student's t-test. Data represent mean +/- SD and are
representative of 3 experiments.

Figure 7. YM155 inhibits growth of Ptch mutant tumor cells in vivo

Author Manuscript

(A-F) Tumor cells were suspended in GFR matrigel (1:1 with media) and implanted in the
flanks of Nude mice. When tumors reached ∼100mm3, mice were split into two cohorts and
treatment was started. For (A-C), tumors were treated with vehicle (20% DMSO in saline)
or YM155 (20 μM) via intratumoral injection twice a week (vehicle n=5, YM155 n=6). For
(D-F), mice were treated with vehicle (saline) or YM155 (10 mg/kg/day) via micro-osmotic
pump (vehicle n=6, YM155 n=5). Caliper measurements were made twice a week to
monitor tumor growth (A,D) and resulting tumors were collected, photographed (B,E), and
weighed (C,F). Experiments were repeated 2 (A-C) and 3 times (D-F) respectively. Both
intra-tumoral and systemic treatment with YM155 decreased tumor size over time compared
to vehicle control. (p<0.02 for IT and pump YM155 tumor weight by ANOVA with post hoc
student's t-test). Error bars represent SEM.
