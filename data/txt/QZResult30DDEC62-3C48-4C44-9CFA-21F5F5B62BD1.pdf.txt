BACKGROUND: Oncogenic AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling has recently been shown
to contribute to tumor survival and proliferation in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) through its downstream
effector eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which may control cyclin D1 protein levels. However, the clinical significance of eIF4E expression in MCL is unknown. METHODS: The authors investigated the prognostic
significance of eIF4E expression in 70 MCL patients uniformly treated with hyper-CVAD and rituximab,
alternating with the rituximab, high-dose methotrexate, and cytarabine regimen (R-hyper-CVAD). eIF4E
expression was assessed using tissue biopsy specimens obtained before treatment, immunohistochemical
methods, and a highly specific monoclonal antibody. Failure-free (FFS) and overall (OS) survival were used
as endpoints in univariate and multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: High eIF4E expression was found in
28 (40%) MCL tumors. After a median follow-up of 51 months for survivors, the 5-year FFS was 20.6% for
patients with high eIF4E expression, compared with 63.5% for patients with low or no eIF4E expression (P ¼
.01, log-rank). Similarly, the 5-year OS was 40.1% for patients with high eIF4E expression, compared with
73.8% for patients with low or no eIF4E expression (P ¼ .018, log-rank). In multivariate analysis, eIF4E expression was associated with poorer FFS and OS, along with age >60 years and high b2–microglobulin in the final
prognostic model. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, eIF4E, which seems to recapitulate most of the biologic
effects of mTOR signaling in MCL, is an independent predictor of clinical outcome in MCL patients uniformly

immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene on the derivative chromosome 14, leading to increased transcription of cyclin
D1 under the influence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain
gene enhancers.2-4 As a result, cyclin D1 gene is overexpressed in MCL.
The majority of patients with MCL have an aggressive clinical course, with frequent recurrences and median
survival of 3 to 5 years. Historically, the median failurefree survival (FFS) has ranged from 10 to 20 months with
standard treatment regimens that include doxorubicin,
and therefore many new investigational therapies are
being pursued.5,6 Among the chemotherapeutic regimens
currently being used for the treatment of MCL, the
hyper-CVAD regimen, and very recently the rituximab,
high-dose methotrexate, and cytarabine (R-hyperCVAD) regimen followed by stem cell transplant, have
proven to be effective treatments, with response rates
reported up to 94% and overall survival (OS) and 3-year
event-free survival rates of 92% and 72%, respectively.7,8
Rapamycin and its analogs that belong to the macrolide group of antibiotics have recently been shown to have
activity against various tumor types (reviewed by Easton
and Houghton9), including mantle cell lymphoma.10-12
In a phase 2 clinical trial using a single-agent rapamycin
analog, temsirolimus (CCI-779), Witzig et al reported an
overall response rate of 38% in patients with recurrent or
refractory MCL.10 Rapamycin exerts its action through
the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR),13 a serine-threonine protein kinase that forms 2
distinct protein complexes within a cell: mTOR-raptor,
which is sensitive to rapamycin, and mTOR-rictor, which
was initially thought to be rapamycin insensitive.14 A
more recent study, however, has shown that prolonged exposure to rapamycin may sequester mTOR, and thus
indirectly inhibit mTOR-rictor activity in lymphoid
cells.15 This is of particular importance, as mTOR-rictor
phosphorylates and activates AKT in vitro,16 which in
turn is capable of activating several downstream effectors
involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation.17
One of the best known downstream effectors of the
mTOR pathway is the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1).13 Phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 by mTOR releases its inhibitory effect on
eIF4E, promoting cap-dependent mRNA translation.13
eIF4E is a key regulator of translation of gene products
that are involved in regulation of the cell cycle including
4728

cyclin D1.18 The potential role of eIF4E in lymphomagenesis has been shown in recent studies that provide solid
evidence that eIF4E may recapitulate the lymphomagenic
effects of the AKT/mTOR pathway in an El-Myc mouse
model of B-cell lymphoma.19,20 Moreover, high expression of eIF4E may confer resistance to chemotherapy or
rapamycin treatment in lymphoma cells.21 eIF4E expression has previously been reported in non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with the highest frequency being observed in
aggressive B- or T-cell lymphoma types.22,23
Despite the strong association of t(11;14)(q13;q32)
and cyclin D1 overexpression with MCL, it is currently
believed that additional oncogenic mechanisms may contribute to its pathogenesis, because earlier studies using
transgenic mice failed to demonstrate that cyclin D1 overexpression is by itself sufficient for oncogenesis.24,25 Accumulating evidence suggests that pharmacologic inhibition
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in MCL cells leads to
decreased survival of tumor cells through cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis.11,12,26,27 Furthermore, we have recently
demonstrated in MCL cells that mTOR signaling may
regulate cyclin D1 levels through its downstream effector
eIF4E.27 In fact, eIF4E appears to recapitulate most of the
effects of AKT/mTOR signaling on apoptosis inhibition
and cell cycle progression in MCL in vitro.27 The clinical
significance of eIF4E expression, however, remains to be
defined.
In this study, we determined the expression levels of
eIF4E in a series of previously untreated patients with
MCL and correlated its expression with the presenting
clinical and laboratory features and clinical outcome. The
longer FFS and OS achieved with R-hyper-CVAD in
MCL patients7,8 allows for statistically meaningful prognostic studies that may better stratify these patients. We
report here that eIF4E expression independently predicts
prognosis in patients with MCL uniformly treated with
R-hyper-CVAD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Group
The study included patients who were previously
untreated, had a diagnosis of MCL confirmed at The M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center, and had available pretreatment paraffin blocks or unstained slides for

immunohistochemical analysis. All patients included in
the study were treated uniformly according to the protocol. The diagnosis of MCL was established using the criteria of the World Health Organization classification.1

Staging and Therapy
All patients received a pretreatment evaluation for staging,
including a complete physical examination, chest radiograph, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, bilateral bone marrow biopsies with unilateral or bilateral
aspirations, whole body computed tomography scan, and
a gallium and/or positron emission tomography scans
when indicated. Patients also had their blood drawn for
serum chemistry, including complete blood count with
differential as well as serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) and b2-microglobulin. Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis for lymphoid cell surface markers was
performed on peripheral blood as well as bone marrow
aspirates from each patient. A high serum LDH level was
considered as >618 IU/L (normal range, 313-618 IU/L),
and b2-microglobulin was considered high when levels
exceeded 3.0 mg/L (normal range, 0.7-1.8 mg/L).
After signing an informed consent approved by the
institutional review board, all patients were enrolled into a
prospective clinical trial that included administration of
rituximab plus fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with
rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine (Rhyper-CVAD) for 6 to 8 cycles.8

Immunohistochemical Analysis
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using previously published methods.27 Briefly, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 lm thick) were
obtained and deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a
graded series of alcohol solutions. A monoclonal antibody
specific for total eIF4E (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass) was used for immunostaining. Heat-induced
antigen retrieval was performed using preheated target retrieval solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia were included, because
germinal center cells (centroblasts) normally express
eIF4E, thus serving as a positive control. In addition, coexistent reactive centroblasts found in each tumor speciCancer

men were used as internal positive controls. Antibody
specificity and subcellular localization of eIF4E protein in
lymphoma cells was analyzed using Western blot analysis
after subcellular fractionation in a previous study by our
group.23 Total eIF4E was localized to the cytoplasmic
compartment of the lymphoma cells. On the basis of the
intensity of immunostaining in tumor and internal positive control cells, eIF4E expression levels in tumor cells
were semiquantitatively graded as negative when no tumor cells expressed eIF4E; weakly positive (low expression) when the intensity of staining was weaker than that
of germinal center cells; and strongly positive (high
expression) when the tumor cells expressed eIF4E with
staining intensity equal to or greater than that of germinal
center cells. The slides were reviewed and scored independently by 2 pathologists. The interobserver variability
on semiquantitative grading for eIF4E expression was
minimal in most cases. In the small subset of cases with
discrepancies, a third pathologist reviewed the case, and a
consensus was then reached.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed comparing high versus
low or absent expression of eIF4E. This cutoff was chosen
because high eIF4E expression in mantle cell lymphoma
cells might represent well-defined overexpression of the
protein and, in addition, this cutoff was found to be the
most discriminative regarding clinical outcome in the
present study group. Expression of eIF4E was compared
with a variety of clinical and laboratory features using the
chi-square and Fischer exact tests. FFS was defined as time
from the beginning of treatment to initial treatment failure or to last follow-up. Treatment failure was defined as
recurrence or progression of disease, death caused by disease or toxic effects, and death caused by treatment-related
second malignancies.8 OS was measured from the onset of
therapy to the date of last follow-up or death from any
cause, whichever occurred first. The Kaplan-Meier
method was applied to measure actuarial survival using
the log-rank test.28 Statistical independence of individual
prognostic factors was evaluated by multivariate analysis
using the Cox proportional hazards model.29 Statistical
analysis was performed using Statview (Abacus Concepts,
Berkeley, Calif).

RESULTS
Study Group
We identified a total of 70 patients treated under the same
R-hyper-CVAD protocol with a biopsy-proven diagnosis
of MCL who had available pretreatment tissue blocks or
unstained slides for immunohistochemistry. There were
55 men and 15 women, with a median age of 62 years
(range, 42-82 years). The median follow-up was
51 months for this study group. Sixty-two tumors had
typical histology, and 8 were blastoid variant. The presenting clinical characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1.

eIF4E Expression in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Germinal center centroblasts and tingible body macrophages also stained for eIF4E and were used as positive
controls. Reactive small lymphocytes present in benign
lymph nodes including the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles were negative for eIF4E.
eIF4E was expressed in the neoplastic cells of 47 of
70 (67%) MCL tumors. In eIF4E-positive tumor cells,
eIF4E expression was primarily cytoplasmic. High eIF4E
expression was noted in 28 (40%), whereas low or no
expression of eIF4E was observed in 19 (27%) and 23
(33%) tumors, respectively (Fig. 1). eIF4E expression did

not correlate with any presenting clinical and laboratory
features in the entire study group, including age, sex, blastoid morphology, elevated serum b2-microglobulin or
LDH levels, B symptoms, or peripheral blood involvement (Table 1). Similarly, eIF4E expression did not

appear to correlate with International Prognostic Index
(IPI) (0-4) or an IPI >2 (Table 1).
Univariate Survival Analysis
Complete clinical and laboratory parameters and followup data were available on all 70 patients for survival analysis. The significance of the established prognostic parameters was evaluated by univariate statistical analysis using
the Kaplan-Meier method (Table 2). The prognostic factors analyzed included: age, sex, histology, serum b2microglobulin or LDH levels, presence of B symptoms,
presence of peripheral blood involvement, and IPI score
(0-2 vs >2).
After a median follow-up of 51 months, 18 of 28
(64%) patients with high eIF4E expression experienced
failure of therapy, compared with 16 of 42 (38%) patients
with low or no expression of eIF4E. The level of eIF4E
expression (negative vs low vs high) significantly correlated with FFS and OS in the entire study group. However, when no and low eIF4E expression were grouped
together, survival analysis provided more discriminating
prognostic information. At 5-years, FFS was 20.6% for
patients with high eIF4E expression, compared with
63.5% for those with low or no eIF4E expression (P ¼
.01, log-rank test) (Fig. 2A). Similarly, after the same follow-up period, 16 of 28 (57%) patients with high eIF4E
expression died, compared with 9 of 42 (21%) patients
with low or no eIF4E expression. The OS at 5 years was
40.1% for the high eIF4E expression group, compared
with 73.8% for the low/no eIF4E expression group (P ¼
.018, log-rank test) (Fig. 2B).
When survival analysis was restricted to 62 patients
with classic (typical) MCL morphology, the 5-year FFS

was 22.7% in those patients with high eIF4E expression,
compared with 68.2% in those with low or no eIF4E
expression (P ¼ .009, log-rank test) (Fig. 2C). Similarly,
the 5-year OS was 42.9% in patients with high eIF4E
expression, compared with 74.4% in those with low or no
eIF4E expression (P ¼ .02, by log-rank test) (Fig. 2D).
Multivariate Survival Analysis
Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards
model was applied to the entire study group (n ¼ 70),
4732

with eIF4E expression being the standard covariate and all
other prognostic variables as shown in Table 2 being
introduced 1 by 1 as covariates in this model. This analysis
revealed that high eIF4E expression is an independent
adverse prognostic factor associated with a shorter FFS,
along with age 60 years (P ¼ .018), blastoid morphology (P ¼ .016), and high serum levels of b2-microglobulin (P ¼ .012) or LDH (P ¼ .0007). Similar results were
obtained when multivariate analysis was restricted to the
group of 62 patients with classic (typical) MCL
morphology.
When various prognostic factors were added together as covariates in the analysis of FFS, high eIF4E
expression, age >60 years, and high serum b2-microglobulin levels remained significant in the final Cox model
(Table 3). Of note, these prognostic parameters were also
significant for OS (Table 3). In addition, the combination
of these 3 independent prognostic factors (eIF4E expression, age >60 years, and high serum b2-microglobulin)
was found to be highly predictive of FFS and OS in this
series of patients with MCL who were treated with Rhyper-CVAD. As shown in Figure 3, the addition of each
of these factors was highly predictive of FFS (P < .0001,
log-rank test) and OS (P < .0012, log-rank test).

DISCUSSION
MCL is recognized as a distinctive type of B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma that represents approximately 6% of
all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.1 MCL is characterized by
small-sized to medium-sized lymphoid cells that are positive for surface immunoglobulin, pan–B-cell antigens,
and CD5, and are negative for CD10 and CD23. The tumor cells also overexpress cyclin D1 as a result of
t(11;14)(q13;q32), which juxtaposes the CCND-1 gene at
chromosome 11q13 with the immunoglobulin heavychain (IgH) gene on chromosome 14, resulting in overexpression of cyclin D1.30 Although altered expression of
cyclin D1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
MCL, the mechanisms of lymphomagenesis in MCL are
more complex and involve components of DNA damage
response, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulatory pathways.31
Cytogenetic analysis of MCL cases commonly demonstrates complex karyotypic abnormalities.32 In addition,

translation.13 Interestingly, eIF4E may recapitulate the

FIGURE 3. The number of adverse prognostic factors (0-3)
was found to be highly predictive of failure-free survival
(FFS) or overall survival (OS) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who were uniformly treated with the rituximab, highdose methotrexate, and cytarabine regimen. Three independent prognostic factors (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E expression, age >60 years, and high serum b2-microglobulin) that
remained significant in the final Cox model were used in this
analysis.

eIF4E was expressed in MCL cell lines and a subset of
MCL tumors.27 Inhibition of eIF4E expression was associated with decreased cyclin D1 levels that led to increased
cell death and progression of cell cycle through S-phase.27
These data suggest that eIF4E, at least in part, mediates
the effects of AKT/mTOR signaling on cell cycle progression and apoptosis inhibition in MCL cells. The regulation of cyclin D1 by eIF4E, a finding of particular
importance in MCL, has also been demonstrated at the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional level in NIH 3T3
cells.18 Taken together, these data suggest an important
role for eIF4E in the pathogenesis of MCL. However, to
4734

our knowledge, the clinical significance of eIF4E expression in MCL has not been investigated to date.
In the current study, we report that eIF4E is
expressed at a high level in approximately 40% of MCL
tumors, and that high eIF4E expression is associated with
significantly shorter FFS and OS in patients uniformly
treated with R-hyper-CVAD regimen. Similarly significant results were obtained when survival analysis was restricted to only those tumors with classic (typical)
morphology. The small number of blastoid variant MCL
in this series (n ¼ 8) precludes definite conclusions for the
prognostic significance of eIF4E expression in this group.
Univariate analysis demonstrated the prognostic significance of presenting clinical and laboratory features of
patients with MCL treated with R-hyper-CVAD regimen,
including age 60 years, blastoid morphology, and high
serum levels of b2 microglobulin or LDH (Table 2). IPI
score >2 also was found to be correlated with shorter FFS
in this cohort. Furthermore, multivariate analysis demonstrated that eIF4E is a significant independent prognostic
variable associated with a shorter FFS, along with age >60
years and high serum b2-microglobulin levels (Table 3).
Combined, these 3 factors highly predict failure of Rhyper-CVAD therapy and overall survival of patients
with MCL. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
show prognostic significance of eIF4E in any lymphoma
type. With regard to other tumors, to our knowledge a
limited number of recent studies have reported associations between expression of eIF4E and worse clinical outcome in head and neck, gastric, ovarian, or breast
cancer.35-39
Several biologic factors, including cytogenetic
abnormalities, p53 gene mutations or overexpression,34,40
p16 and p21 gene alterations,33 and p27 degradation,41 as
well as proliferation indices42-44 have been evaluated to
date as potential predictors of clinical outcome in patients
with MCL. Gene expression profiling studies have identified a molecular signature for a distinct subgroup of MCL
patients that portend poor prognosis.45 Of note, the genes
are mostly associated with cell growth and cycle progression.45 However, to our knowledge, none of these studies
analyzed biologic prognostic factors in patients treated
with regimens associated with high response and survival
rates such as R-hyper-CVAD. Our patient group included
70 patients who were uniformly treated with a regimen
comprised of rituximab plus R-hyper-CVAD alternating

with rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate-cytarabine
for a total of 6 to 8 cycles. We elected to choose this group
of patients because MCL responds poorly to conventional
doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, producing much
shorter median FFS and OS. With the advent of newer
therapeutic regimens for treatment of MCL patients,
there is emerging evidence that the R-hyper-CVAD regimen is very effective in patients with aggressive MCL,
with response rates of 94% and OS and FFS rates at 3 years
of 92% and 72%, respectively, reported after 4 cycles of
this therapy.7 By using 6 to 8 cycles, the patients in the
current study group achieved longer disease remissions,
with a median follow-up of 40 months.8 Such long remission periods has allowed us to analyze the clinical significance of biologic parameters such as eIF4E that play an
important role in the pathogenesis of MCL. The identification of novel biological prognostic factors is important
for MCL patients, because features directly related to the
biology of MCL may provide a rational basis for investigational therapy.
In conclusion, the results of the current study indicate that high eIF4E expression independently predicts
shorter FFS and OS in patients with MCL who are uniformly treated with R-hyper-CVAD. Modulation of
mTOR/eIF4E activity, which significantly contributes to
MCL tumor cell survival, is an attractive potential target
for treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory
MCL.
