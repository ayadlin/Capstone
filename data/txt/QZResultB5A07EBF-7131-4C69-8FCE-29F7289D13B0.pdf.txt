ABSTRACT
Despite numerous therapies that effectively inhibit estrogen signaling in breast
cancer, a significant proportion of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
malignancy will succumb to their disease. Herein we demonstrate that long-term
estrogen deprivation (LTED) therapy among ER-positive breast cancer cells results in
the adaptive increase in ER expression and subsequent activation of multiple tyrosine
kinases. Combination therapy with the ER down-regulator fulvestrant and dasatinib, a
broad kinase inhibitor, exhibits synergistic activity against LTED cells, by reduction of
cell proliferation, cell survival, cell invasion and mammary acinar formation. Screening
kinase phosphorylation using protein arrays and functional proteomic analysis
demonstrates that the combination of fulvestrant and dasatinib inhibits multiple
tyrosine kinases and cancer-related pathways that are constitutively activated in
LTED cells. Because LTED cells display increased insulin receptor (InsR)/insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling, we added an ant-IGF-1 antibody to
the combination with fulvestrant and dasatinib in an effort to further increase the
inhibition. However, adding MK0646 only modestly increased the inhibition of cell
growth in monolayer culture, but neither suppressed acinar formation nor inhibited
cell migration in vitro and invasion in vivo. Therefore, combinations of fulvestrant
and dasatinib, but not MK0646, may benefit patients with tyrosine-kinase-activated,
endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

designed to inhibit the ER or estradiol synthesis and even
sequentially alternating drugs for long-term suppression
of estrogen signaling [1-6], drug resistance still develops
[7-11]. Thus, a significant portion of patients with
ER-positive disease will develop resistance after an
overwhelming initial response and succumb to resistant

ER-positive disease is the most common type of
breast cancer, accounting for nearly 75% of all cases.

for these patients, allowing for a variety of approaches

disease.
We and others proposed that acquired resistance is
due to the adaptive enhancement of ER expression and/ or
activation of growth factor receptors after anti-estrogen
therapy, as well as through crosstalk between ER and
growth factor receptor signaling pathways, resulting in
ligand-independent ER activation [12-20]. We previously
established long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) in ERpositive breast cancer cell lines, which models endocrine
therapy-resistant breast cancer [17]. Using these cell lines
as models, we demonstrated enhancement of InsR/IGF-1R
pathway in LTED ER-positive cells. Although inhibition
of InsR and IGF-IR suppressed cell growth, the effect
increased when combined with fulvestrant [17, 18], a
second-line, pure ER antagonist that destroys the receptor
without any agonist effect [21, 22]. However, this didn’t
inhibit the invasion of LTED cells [17-19].
Dasatinib, broad specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(BMS-354825; Bristol-Myers Squibb), was initially
isolated as a dual SRC/ABL inhibitor and is used for the
treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia
[23, 24]. Growing evidence suggests that dasatinib not
only targets ABL and the SRC family, but also targets
multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Through this activity dasatinib
can inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
Thus, it is currently being evaluated for use in multiple
solid tumors [25].
The purpose of the present study was to seek a
combination to successfully inhibit resistance pathways
stimulated among ER-positive tumors. Thus, herein we
evaluate the effect of combining fulvestrant with dasatinib
and/or MK0646, an antibody that was developed as
IGF1R antibody. We demonstrate that acquired resistance
to LTED in ER-positive breast cancer is abrogated by
combination of fulvestrant and dasatinib, which together
inhibits multiple biological phenotypes, including
acinar formation, cell survival and invasion as well as
cell proliferation in vitro and vivo. However, adding
MK0646 only modestly inhibited tumor cell growth, but
didn’t inhibit acinar formation, migration and invasion.
The results of our study suggest that the combination
of fulvestrant and dasatinib may be promising for the
treatment of ER-positive disease that is resistant to prior
hormonal therapy.

understand their properties, thus we systematically
evaluated their biological phenotypes. Mammary
acinar formation assay showed that MCF-7/LTED cells
formed numerous acini much larger than parental cells
(P < 0.0001, Fig. 1A, B). When the 3-D culture was
extended to 21 days, MCF-7/LTED cells formed highly
proliferative, abnormal structures. Intriguingly, many cells
spread into the surrounding matrigel of acini, suggesting
the cells possess higher migration/invasion ability. In
contrast, parental cells formed acini with a ‘normal’, more
symmetrical, phenotype absent of spreading (Fig. 1C).
These findings were recapitulated in HCC-1428/LTED
cells (Fig. 1D-F). Clonogenic and migration assays using
parental and LTED MCF7 cells demonstrated that LTED
cells formed more numerous foci than parental cells (P
< 0.0001, Fig. 1 G,H). In addition, LTED cells showed
markedly higher migration capability than their parental
controls (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1I, J)

LTED cells exhibit activation of multiple receptor
tyrosine kinases and cancer-related pathways
Our previous work shows that ER-positive LTED
cells display increased phosphorylation of InsR and
IGF1R, whereas ER-negative LTED cells display
increased phosphorylation of ErbB family members, and
that combined inhibition of IGF1R and ErbB2 reduces cell
proliferation over monotherapy [17]. Since these targeting
therapies had no effect on cell invasion and metastasis
remains a formidable clinical challenge, evading cure,
we sought to find more efficient therapies targeting cell
invasion. This is a fundamental experimental question
since traditional chemotherapy can eliminate rapidly
proliferating cancer cells but does not specifically target
metastatic processes.
To investigate invasion, we began by studying
signaling alterations of LTED cells using protein array
and reverse-phase protein array. After screening 49
phosphorylated human RTKs and 43 downstream kinases
using protein array (see Materials and Methods), we
demonstrated enhanced activation of multiple RTKs,
indicated by increased phosphorylation compared to
parental cells, including ephrin receptors (EphA1, P =
0.0009; EphA7, P = 0.001), hepatocyte growth factor
(HGFR) receptor (P = 0.021), receptor-like tyrosine
kinase (RYK, P = 0.043) and developmental tyrosine
kinase (Dtk, P = 0.001). We also demonstrated that LTED
cells exhibited a higher response to IGF and EGF (10 ng/
ml of each) than the parental cells, indicated by greater
phosphorylation of IGF-1R, InsR (P = 0.0445, 0.0032,
respectively) and ErbB receptors, including EGFR,
ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 (P = 0.04, 0.004, 0.0027,
0.0189, respectively) (Fig. 2A, B and data not shown).
Consistently, phosphorylation of their downstream kinases
increased, including AKT, GSK3, c-Jun and MAPK as

0.0249, 0.0354, 0.0059 respectively) (Fig. 2C,D and data
not shown). We further verified the findings using RPPA
[26-28] (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the findings from
protein array, LTED cells constitutively activated several
cancer-associated pathways, including the PI3K-AKT
and ERK/MAPK pathways, which in turn activate the
effectors, including S6, 4EBP1, YB1, β-catenin, cyclin
B1 (P < 0.0001 respectively) and cyclin E1 (P = 0.037,
Fig. 2F). Therefore, our results led us to wonder whether
inhibiting tyrosine kinases using the broad specific

inhibitor dasatinib, and/or targeting InsR/IGF-1R pathway
using the antibody MK0646, would synergize with the ER
down-regulator, fulvestrant.

Basis for combination therapy using fulvestrant,
dasatinib and MK0646 on LTED cells
In our previous study, we found that ER expression
adaptively increased in LTED ER-positive cells [17]. In
the present study, we confirmed these findings using MCF-

as described in Materials and Methods. Representative field images of acini were taken on day 14 (A, D), and taken on day 21 (C, F).
The quantitative analysis of the total acinar area per field was performed with AlphaVIEW SA software. The data are mean +/- standard

7/LTED and HCC-1428/LTED cells and also found that
low dose fulvestrant (2 nM) markedly down-regulated
ER expression (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and suppressed
proliferation dose-dependently in both parental and LTED
MCF-7 and HCC1428 cells, although response of LTED
cells is lower than that of parental controls (Supplementary
Fig. S1 B, C). To determine whether dasatinib effects
cell signaling in LTED cells, we treated the cells with
dasatinib (20 nM) and scanned 49 phosphorylated human
RTKs using a protein array (see Materials and Methods).
We observed that dasatinib inhibits multiple RTKs,
including ephrin receptors (EphA1, P = 0.0067; EphA7,
P = 0.0171; EphB2, P = 0.0078), HGFR (P = 0.0026),
platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) α/β (P
= 0.0126, 0.015 respectively), RYK (P = 0.0108), and Trk
tyrosine kinase receptors (TrkA, P = 0.036; TrkC, P =
0.0149) (Supplementary Fig. S1. D, E ). Using MK0646,
an antibody developed against IGF-1R, we demonstrated
that MK0646 (100 µg/ml) almost completely inhibited
IGF1R (P=0.0002). Strikingly, it not only restrained
IGF1R, but also inhibited more than 70% InsR (P=0.0007,
Supplementary Fig. S1 (F, G), which might be with more
effective than targeting IGF-IR alone. Taking together,

nM or more) and MK0646 (100 µg/ml) mildly increased
inhibitory effect compared with dasatinib or MK0646
alone in both MCF-7/LTED cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2 C, D and data not shown) and HCC1428/LTED
(Supplementary Fig. S2 E, F, data not shown). Taking
together, combinations of fulvestrant/dasatinib markedly
inhibit LTED cell proliferation; adding high dose of
MK0646 (100 µg/ml) to fulvestrant or dasatinib mildly
increased the inhibitory effect in both MCF-7/LTED and
HCC1428/LTED cells. Addition of high dose MK0646
(100 µg/ml) to combination of fulvestrant/dasatinib further
increased the inhibitory effect on MCF-7/LTED cells, but
not on HCC1428/LTED cells.
To detect the effect of fulvestrant, dasatinib or
MK0646 on cell survival, we performed clonogenic
assay. MCF-7/LTED cells were treated with monotherapy
or variable combinations as indicated (Fig. 3E, F, detail
in Materials and Method). Comparing with vehicle,
fulvestrant markedly decreased colony number and size
(expressed as total colony area, P < 0.0001), whereas
dasatinib and MK0646 had a lower effect than fulvestrant.
Combination of dasatinib and fulvestrant further increased
the inhibitory effect (P < 0.0001) than fulvestrant or
dasatinib alone. Adding MK0646 to the combination of
fulvestrant/dasatinib did not further increase the inhibitory
effect.

and/or MK0646 on cell proliferation and survival

Addition of dasatinib, but not MK0646, to
fulvestrant markedly inhibits mammary acinar
formation and migration of LTED cells

To explore whether combinations of fulvestrant,
dasatinib and/or MK0646 would increase therapeutic
efficacy on cell proliferation and survival, we treated
LTED cells in monolayer culture. In our preliminary
studies, we detected the effect of each drug with variable
doses. Fulvestrant (2 nM), dasatinib (20 nM), MK0646
(100 µg/ml) were used as fixed doses, and combined
with each of the other two drugs in variable doses. The
combination of fulvestrant and dasatinib significantly
inhibited growth of MCF-7/LTED (P < 0.001, Fig. 3A).
Synergy analyses exhibited synergistic interactions.
B). These findings were recapitulated in HCC-1428/
LTED cells (Fig. 3C,D). The combination of fulvestrant/
MK0646 modestly decreased proliferation compared with
fulvestrant alone in MCF-7/LTED (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A).
Synergy analyses showed mild synergistic interaction
when fulvestrant combined with high dose (100 µg/ml)
MK0646 (Supplementary Fig. S2A) in MCF-7/LTED
cells, but did not show the benefit in HCC-1428/LTED
cells (Fig. 3C, Supplementary Fig. S2B). Adding MK0646
increased inhibitory effect of fulvestrant/dasatinib in
MCF-7/LTED cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 3A), but didn’t show
further inhibitory effect in HCC1428/LTED cells (P >
0.05; Fig. 3C). Combination of high doses of dasatinib (20

Since LTED cells in 3-D culture exhibit increased
proliferation and formation of abnormal acini structures
compared with parental controls, we further explored the
effects of fulvestrant, dasatinib and MK0646 as single
agents or combinations on mammary acinar formation
and morphogenesis. Our preliminary study showed that
the dose of dasatinib (20 nM) used for the monolayer cell
growth assay did not inhibit MCF-7/LTED cell growth
in matrigel, hence we used 40 nM dasatinib as the fixed
dose for combinations. Fulvestrant with low dose (2 nM)
markedly, dasatinib (40 nM) mildly inhibited MCF-7/
LTED cells growth in matrigel. Intriguling, MK0646 (100
µg/ml) didn’t inhibit, but induced acini growth in both
MCF-7/LTED (P < 0.01, Fig. 4A,B) and HCC1428/LTED
cells (P < 0.0001, Fig. 4C,D). The addition of dasatinib
to fulvestrant significantly inhibited acinar formation
and proliferation (P < 0.0001), consistent with the effect
on cell growth in monolayer cell culture. However, the
addition of MK0646 to fulvestrant, or dasatinib or to
the combination of fulvestrant/dasatinib did not further
decrease the acini number or size in both MCF-7/LTED
cells (Fig. 4A,B) and HCC1428/LTED cells (Fig. 4C,D).

migration using transwells. Strikingly, we observed
different patterns of drug effects on cell proliferation and
acinar formation. In this regards, dasatinib markedly,
and fulvestrant (4 nM) modestly, inhibited MCF-7/
LTED cell migration induced by fibronectin (P < 0.0001,
respectively). MK0646 did not show any inhibitory effect.
Addition of fulvestrant and/or MK0646 to dasatinib did
not further increase the inhibition over dasatinib alone
(Fig. 4E, F).

Dasatinib monotherapy decreased invasion, however, this
failed to reach significance likely due to the small sample
size.
Strikingly, the combination of dasatinib and
fulvestrant completely blocked tumor invasion (P
< 0.05). However, all tumors treated with MK0646
alone or combination of MK0646/fulvestrant exhibited
invasion (Fig. 5D). There are few reports of distant
metastatic disease in primary MCF-7 xenografts in the
literatures limited that we know. In the MCF-7/LTED
xenograft model, 3 cases of distant metastatic disease
were documented. It is interesting that two of the three
cases were in mice treated with MK0646: a metastatic
adrenal gland tumor in the fulvestrant/MK0646 group
(Supplementary Fig. S3A), and a metastatic tumor in a
lymph node adjacent to the subcutaneous tumor in the
MK0646 alone group (Supplementary Fig. S3B). There
was one case of a lung intravascular tumor in the vehicle
group (data not shown). However, no metastatic disease
was found in mice treated with fulvestrant, dasatinib or
fulvestrant/dasatinib, although the number of animals in
each group was small.

Combination of fulvestrant with dasatinib, but
not MK0646, inhibits both tumor proliferation
and invasion of LTED xenografts
Next, we determined whether the effects seen in
our in vitro assays are reflected under in vivo conditions.
For this purpose, we established MCF-7/LTED xenografts
in ovariectomized nude athymic mice without E2 pellet
supplementation. Seven days after tumor cell implantation,
100% (40/40) of the mice had palpable tumors. The
mice were treated with vehicle, fulvestrant, dasatinib,
MK0646, or combinations as indicated in Fig. 5A (see
Materials and Methods). Tumors in mice treated with
dasatinib or fulvestrant continued to grow for several days
before stabilizing at or near the original tumor volume.
In contrast, MK0646 treated tumors remained relatively
constant in size throughout the time period. At the end
of the 28-day study, tumors treated with fulvestrant,
dasatinib or MK0646 were approximately the same size
as at the initiation of the study, while the tumors treated
with vehicle increased by about 35%. In contrast, the
combinations (fulvestrant/dasatinib, fuvestrant/MK0646,
fulvestrant/dasatinib/MK0646) induced tumor regression
with essentially similar activity over the time period
of analysis. The ability of the fulvestrant/dasatinib
combination to decrease tumor volume appeared delayed
compared with the other combinations. On day 28th of
therapy, the mice were sacrificed. Xenograft tumors
and all organs of each mouse were subjected to blinded
histopathological analysis by a veterinary pathologist.
Fulvestant, MK0646, or dasatinib alone mildly altered
stromal content with increasing fibrosis formation (35%,
28%, 30% respectively), higher than that of vehicle group.
Adding MK0646 to fulvestrant didn’t increase fibrosis
formation (30%). However adding dasatinb to fulvestrant
or fulvestrant/MK0646 further increased stromal content
(40%, 45%, respectively) (Fig. 5B). Fulvestrant markedly
(70%) and dasatinib mildly (22%), decreased the level of
Ki67 (the proliferation maker), while MK0646 did not
alter Ki67 level compared with vehicle. Addition dasatinib
and/or MK0646 to fulvestrant did not further increase the
inhibitory effect of fulvestrant on Ki67 (73%, 70%, 72%,
respectively) (Fig. 5C). Four of five tumors in vehicle
group showed invasion to adjacent structures. Fulvestrant
alone did not change the frequency of invasive structures.

Effects of the combination of fulvestrant,
dasatinib and/or MK0646 on cellular signaling in
LTED cells
To identify the mechanism by which the combination
of fulvestrant and dasatinib abrogates resistance to
endocrine therapy in breast cancer, we systematically
detected effects of the targeting therapies on cancer-related
signaling that elevated in LTED cells using Western blot,
protein array and reverse phase protein array. Parental and
LTED MCF-7 and HCC1428 cells were treated for 6 hours
with fulvestrant, dasatinib or MK0646 either as single
agents or in variable combinations followed by stimulation
with or without 5% FBS in variable time. The cell lysates
were analyzed with Western blot for phosphorylation of
AKT, MAPK and S6, the key molecules in PI3K-AKT
and ERK/MAPK pathways (Fig. 6A, Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Compared with the parental cells, LTED cells
exhibited elevation of phosphorylation of AKT, MAPK
and S6 without FBS stimulation and stronger response
to FBS-stimulation, suggesting constitutively activation
of PI3K-AKT pathway and ERK/MAPK pathway, which
is consistent with findings from RPPA and protein array
showed in Fig. 2. Fulvestrant, dasatinib in single reagent
didn’t or mildly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT
and MAPK in both parental and LTED cells. MK0646
monotherapy inhibited phosphorylation of AKT in parental
cells, but not in LTED cells with FBS-stimulation. All
combinations exhibited inhibitory effect in both parental
and LTED cells in variable scale (Fig. 6A, green square,
Supplementary Fig. S4A), suggesting combinations of
fulvestrant, dasatinib or MK0646 effectively inhibit PI3K9056

AKT and MAPK pathways.
We further explored variation of expression
or phosphorylation of 98 proteins in 32 experiment
samples with biological triplicates (For a sample list, see
Supplementary Table S1; Antibody list see Supplementary
Table S2) by RPPA (Supplementary Fig. S4B). On the
basis of unsupervised hierarchical clustering, parental cells
without FBS stimulation form a cluster at the bottom of
the dendrogram, followed by a cluster of parental cells
stimulated with 5% FBS, and then LTED cells without
FBS simulation. The upper cluster is formed by LTED
stimulated with 5% FBS. Thus, in terms of protein and
phospho-protein levels, LTED are distinct from parental
cells with FBS altering protein and phospho-protein levels
in both groups. The effects of the targeting therapies did
not alter the composition of the main clusters formed by
LTED and FBS stimulation, indicating that the LTED cells
are markedly different from the parental cells. Interestingly
MK0646 monotherapy resulted in MCF-7/LTED cells
without FBS stimulation to share characteristics with
MCF7/LTED cells stimulated with FBS (Pink frame
in Supplementary Fig. S4B, red in Supplementary

Table S1). As expected, fulvestrant markedly down
regulated ER; MK0646 markedly inhibited both IGF1R and IGFR-β (Fig. 6 B), consistent with the findings
from Western blot (Supplementary Figure S1A, F).
Combination of fulvestrant and dasatinib significantly
inhibited PI3K-AKT, ERK/MAPK pathways indicating
by decreased phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3, MEK
and MAPK, while adding MK0646 to the combination
of fulvestrant/dasatinib didn’t further increase the
inhibitory effect (Supplementary Fig. S4B and data not
shown). Consistently, the combination of fulvestrant and
dasatinib decreased the key effectors including c-Myc and
cyclin D1. However, addition of MK0646 abolished the
inhibitory effects of fulvestrant or fulvestrant/dasatinib
(Fig. 6B, C). Consistent with the findings from RPPA,
protein array analysis exhibited that dasatinib markedly,
fulvestrant mildly, decreased β-catenin (P < 0.0001), while
MK0646 didn’t show inhibitory effect. Combination of
fulvestrant and dasatinib further increased the inhibitory
effects. However, addition of MK0646 to dasatinib or
to combination of fulvestrant/dasatinib abolished the
inhibitory effect on β-catenin, even showed antagonistic

Figure 7: Mechanism by which targeting tyrosine-kinases and estrogen receptor overcomes endocrine-therapy
resistance in Breast Cancer. Beginning with phospho-RTK and other kinase screening and functional proteomic analysis with RPPA
on LTED ER-positive breast cancer cells with or without treatment with fulvestrant, dasatinib or MK0646 and combining the published
reports, a resultant pathway signature mediated by LTED and the targeting therapies is illustrated. After targeting estrogen therapy, small
number of tumor cells acquired adaptive capacities, including: 1) compensatory increase ER Expression; 2) activation of multiple receptor
tyrosine kinases; 3) signal crosstalk between ER and growth factor receptor pathways. Fulvestrant down-regulates ER and suppresses the
signal crosstalk (pink frame). Dasatinib targets multiple RTKs, including EphAs, HGRR, RYK as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases.
Combination of fulvestrant and dasatinib inhibits cancer cell proliferation and invasion by blocking multiple receptor or non-receptor
tyrosine kinase and targeting ER and crosstalk between ER and growth factor signaling. MK0646 targets IGF1R and Insulin R pathway,
however, somehow activates RYK and Wnt pathway, leading β-catenin accumulation and relocates in nuclei, where, in turn, induce
transcription of c-Myc and cyclin D1.

ER-positive cell growth, whereas the neutralizing IGFIR monoclonal antibody, MAB391, was ineffective,
which was explained that therapeutic targeting of both
InsR and IGF-IR should be more effective than targeting
IGF-IR alone [19]. In the present study, we used another
neutralizing monoclonal antibody, MK0646 that inhibits
both IGF1R and InsR, and also found this to be ineffective
overall, although in a few experiments the addition of
MK0646 to fulvestrant and dasatinib mildly suppressed
monolayer and decreased tumor size of xenografts. In
this regards, adding MK0646 to fulvestrant or fulvestrant/
dasatinib combinations did not increase the inhibitory
effect on tumor cell migration, invasion or mammary
acinar formation. Instead, MK0646 mostly abolished the
inhibitory effects of fulvestrant/dasatinib combinations.
Several clinical trials evaluating MK0646 and other
IGF1R monoclonal antibodies in patients with various
types of solid tumors, including breast cancer are nearing a
conclusion or already completed. It is not surprising given
our observations that the early reports were at variance
[30, 31], but mostly disappointing. It was previously
unknown how the mechanism related to the results. In the
present study, functional proteomic analyses allow us to
demonstrate that although MK0646 blocked IGF-1R/InsR
and inhibited some molecules of PI3K-AKT pathway.
However, the addition of MK0646 abolished the inhibitory
effect of fulvestrant or dasatinib/fulvestrant combinations
on multiple molecules including Stat5 and Stat2, mTOR,
MAPK and β-catenin, the key effector of Wnt pathway
and elevated the key effectors, c-Myc and cyclin D1. Our
RTK-screen showed that MK0646 increased the level
of RYK (data not shown), the atypical receptor tyrosine
kinase, that mediates Wnt signaling independently of
Frizzled and/or function as a Frizzled co-receptor [32,
33], potentially increased β-catenin (Fig. 7). Although
the mechanism by which MK0646 increase β-catenin,
c-Myc and cyclin D1 remains unknown, our findings
may help to explain why several clinical trials on IGF-1R
monoclonal antibodies have been discontinued [34, 35].
We hope that our results may lead to develop new types of
monoclonal antibody against IGF1R/InsR. For example, a
“one-armed” monovalent antibody that prevents antibodyinduced dimerization and results in potent antagonism [36]
or the incorporation of a small molecular RTK inhibitor,
such as OSI-906 or AEW541, targeting IGF-1R/InsR
signaling instead of monoclonal antibodies.
Our results are significant in their implications for
patient management. Although fulvestrant is a secondline therapeutic used to treat ER-positive breast cancer
patients, it has limitations. Even though it effectively
inhibits mammary acinar formation and cell proliferation,
the ability of fulvestrant to inhibit cell migration and
invasion is inadequate, and it has only a partial ability
to induce cell death. Thus, additional therapeutics are
needed to compensate for this imperfections. This is the
rationale for our focus on new combination approaches.

(P < 0.01, 0.001 respectively). The effects of fulvestrant,
dasatinib and MK0646 in single or combinations on
phospho-type of Stat5, Stat2, AMPK, MAPK (ERK1/2),
mTOR and GSK3 exhibited similar pattern with β-catenin,
although addition of MK0646 to dasatinib or fulvestrant/
dasatinib further increased the inhibitory effect on
phospho-AKT (Fig. 6D,E).

DISCUSSION
Herein, we demonstrate that LTED ER-positive
breast cancer cells exhibit a more aggressive phenotype
than primary controls, including increased cell
proliferation, mammary acinar formation, cell survival
and migration. We also show that the combination of
fulvestrant and dasatinib inhibits tumor cell proliferation
and suppresses cell survival and invasion in vitro and in
vivo. An extrapolation of our results hints at the exciting
potential that the combination of dasatinib and fulvestrant
could benefit patients with ER-positive breast cancer that
has become resistant to first-line endocrine therapy like
tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors.
Based upon our data combined with published
reports, we constructed a resultant pathway signature of
LTED cells (Fig. 7). This graphic illustrates the mechanism
by which LTED cells escape estrogen dependence,
acquire a more aggressive biological phenotype and
how fulvestrant and dasatinib interplay in this signaling
pathway. In summary, LTED cells exhibit activation of
multiple RTK: EphA1, EphA7, EphB2, HGFR, RYK,
PDGFRα/β, TrkA and TrkC. They also show an enhanced
response to IGF and EGF, which in turn activates PI3KAKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, which crosstalk with elevated ER. Combination of fulvestrant and
dasatinib significantly inhibits PI3K-AKT, ERK/MAPK
and Stat pathways – the central pathways regulating cancer
cell proliferation, survival, invasion and drug-resistance.
The signaling alterations of LTED cells in turn feed into
multiple transcriptional mediators, including β-catenin,
c-Myc, and cyclin D1, B1 and E1, all which are activated
as a result of the activated signaling.
Our results regarding the activity of dasatinib are in
slight contrast with a previous analysis. In a prior study,
it was reported that dasatinib inhibited EGFR, HER-2 and
HER-3 expression in breast cancer cells, specifically the
cell lines MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and
MDA-MB-231[29]. In our current study, dasatinib did not
inhibit or mildly inhibited phosphorylation of ErbB family
members. The reasons for this are not clear, although it
may be the difference in cell lines between these studies.
Therefore, the combination of an effective inhibitor for
EGFR and HER2 with fulvestrant and dasatinib may
further benefit patients with high ErbB family activity,
endocrine therapy-resistance breast cancer.
In our previous study, we found that IGF1R/InsR
inhibitor, AEW541, showed inhibitory effects on LTED

Hence, our demonstration that dasatinib inhibits multiple
tyrosine kinases in LTED cells and also cell migration
in vitro and invasion in vivo. In summary, dasatinib
synergizes with fulvestrant to inhibit the growth of LTED
cells. The combination of fulvestrant with dasatinib, but
not MK0646 is effective in inhibiting acinar formation
and tumor cell invasion, suggesting that the combination
therapy of dasatinib and fulvestrant may be a therapeutic
strategy for the anti-endocrine therapy resistant ERretained breast cancers.

versus vehicle-treated control. Drug concentrations for
combinations were chosen in fixed-ratio increments. Doseresponse curves were generated using CalcuSyn software
(Biosoft, Ferguson, MO), following the manufacturer’s
guide. Combination Index (CI) < 1, =1, and >1 indicate
synergism, additive, and antagonism, respectively.

Clonogenic assay
To detect the effects of long-term estrogen
deprivation on cell colony formation, MCF-7 and MCF7/LTED cells were seeded at 1,000 cells in 60 mm
dishes with growth medium for 13 days. For inhibitory
assay, after having attached on the dish, MCF-7/LTED
cells were treated for 48 hours with drugs in single or
variable combinations as indicated. Then the drugs were
washed away and cells were allowed to grow in growth
media for 13 days. Dishes were scanned after staining.
Quantitative analysis of the number and total area of
clones were performed with AlphaVIEW SA software
(Cell Biosciences). Data expressed as means of triplicates,
representative of two independent experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
Parental HCC-1428 and MCF-7 lines (ATCC)
were maintained in IMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco). HCC-1428/LTED and MCF7/LTED cells were generated through culture in phenol
red-free IMEM supplemented with 10% dextran-charcoaltreated FBS [DCC-FBS (Hyclone)] [17]. All media were
supplemented with 100 units /ml penicillin, and 100 µg/
ml streptomycin.

Morphogenesis assay

Drugs

Three-dimensional (3-D) culture of cells on matrigel
basement membrane was carried out as described [37].
Briefly, 4 x103 cells were resuspended in modified growth
medium containing 2% growth factor-reduced matrigel
(BD Biosciences) without or with drugs (2 nM fulvestrant,
20 nM Dasatinib, 100 µg/ml MK0646, or combinations)
or vehicle DMSO, and seeded onto matrigel in 8-well
chamber slides (BD Bioscience). Medium with drugs
was replaced every 2 days. Photographs of representative
fields were taken as indicated. Acini were photographed
and counted in 10 randomly chosen fields. Quantitative
analysis of the number and total area of acini were
performed with AlphaVIEW SA software. Data expressed
as means of triplicates, representative of two independent
experiments.

Dasatinib was purchased from Selleck Chemicals
(Houston, TX). Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) was purchased
from Tocris Bioscience, (Ellisville, MO). For in vitro
use, fulvestrant and dasatinib were dissolved in DMSO
(Sigma-Aldrich) to a concentration of 1 mM respectively,
stored at -20oC, and further diluted to an appropriate final
concentration in serum-free medium upon use. DMSO
in the final solution was 0.1% (v/v). For in vivo studies,
dasatinib 50 mg/kg (in 50 µl of DMSO) was given daily
by oral gavage. Fulvestrant (5 mg/50 µl DMSO/mouse,
diluted with 50 µl peanut oil, subcutaneously) was
administered weekly. MK0646, a humanized monoclonal
antibody against IGF-1R was provided by Merck & Co.
(Whitehouse Station, NJ) and used as per manufacturer’s
instructions. For in vivo studies, MK0646 (10 mg/kg, i.p.)
was administered weekly.

Migration assay
Cell migration assays were performed in 24well chambers with 8 µm polycarbonate filters (Becton
Dickinson). After starvation for 20 hours in serum-free
IMEM, 1x105 cells in 0.6 ml IMEM were placed in the
upper chamber, and 0.75 ml of growth medium with
fibronectin (5 µg/ml) as a chemo-attractant was added to
the lower chamber. Drugs (fulvestrant 4 nM, dasatinib 40
nM, MK0646 100 µg/ml) or vehicle were added to both
the upper and lower chambers. Cells were allowed to
migrate through the filter at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours.
Non-migrated cells on the upper surface of the filter were

Cell growth inhibition assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in growth
medium and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Medium was
changed to 2% FBS and cells were incubated at 37oC
overnight, followed by the addition of serial dilutions
of drugs. Growth inhibition was determined 48 hours
later using the CellTiter-Blue viability assay according
to manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). Results of cell
viability were calculated on the basis of percentage change

removed. The cells that penetrated through pores to the
underside of the filter were stained, photographed and
counted in 10 random fields. Data expressed as means of
triplicates, representative of two independent experiments.

Phosphorylation of RTKs and other kinases was
screened with protein array method using human phosphoRTK array kits and human phospho-kinase array kits
(R&D Systems). Relative levels in cell lysates (300 µg
per sample) were analyzed according to manufacturer’s
protocol and quantified with AlphaVIEW SA analysis
software.

Mouse xenografts and in vivo drug studies
Ovariectomized Balb/c athymic (nu/nu) mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories International,
Inc (Wilmington, MA) at 5 weeks of age and housed in
sterile filter-capped cages. Animal studies were carried
out under ACUF-approved protocols. Exponentially
growing MCF-7/LTED cells were harvested, washed,
and resuspended in PBS, and mixed with growth factorreduced matrigel (1:1, Becton Dickinson). 107 cells in
200 µl were injected into the mammary fat pads of mice
at 6 weeks of age. Our preliminary studies demonstrated
that MCF-7/LTED cells form tumors and sustain tumor
growth for more than one month without estrogen
supplementation. Primary MCF-7 cells require estrogen
supplementation to maintain tumor growth [18, 38, 39]
(data not shown). When established tumors were detected
(~7 days after cell injection), mice were randomized to
treatment with vehicles, fulvestrant, dasatinib, MK0646,
or variable combinations (n = 5/group). Tumor sizes were
determined by measuring the length (l) and the width (w)
with calipers twice weekly. Tumor volume was calculated
with the formula (V = l x w2/2). Differences in tumor
volume among treatment groups at each time point were
analyzed using ANOVA. At the end of the experiment,
mice were sacrificed. Tumors were harvested and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin for paraffin embedding. Histological analysis of
tumors and all organs were performed with hematoxylineosin. Tumor xenograft specimens were also stained with
Masson’s trichrome.

Reverse phase protein array (RPPA)
Cell lysates used for Western blot were also used
for RPPA. Samples are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
RPPA was performed as previously described [26-28].
The antibodies used for RPPA are listed in Supplementary
Table S2.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was carried out using ANOVA
test (for multiple groups) and Student t test (for two
groups). Fisher’s exact test was used for analysis of tumor
invasion data. Differences with P values of < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis for
RPPA data in Supplementary Methods.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Paraffin sections were immunostained after antigen
retrieval with boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer for
20 minutes. The antibody to Ki67 (1:100; Abcam) was
used at room temperature (RT) for 60 minutes, followed
by incubation with Dako EnVision+ System-HRP Labeled
Polymer (Anti-Rabbit). Throughout the above analyses,
controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibody.
