ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study is to identify the optimal criteria of the radiotherapeutic
parameters in patients with unresectable locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). 103 patients were enrolled in this study. All patients received RT delivered
using the TomoTherapy Hi-Art system between March 2006 and February 2012.
We evaluated the planning target volume (PTV), total dose (Gy10), and NTNL-VBED20
(non-target normal liver volume receiving more than a biologically effective dose of
20 Gy8) as significant radiotherapeutic parameters associated with hepatic function
deterioration and local progression-free survival (PFS). A PTV of 279 cm3 or 304 cm3,
a total dose of 60 Gy10, and a NTNL-VBED20 of 40.8% were identified as the optimal cutoff values of radiotherapeutic parameters to prevent hepatic function deterioration
and prolong local PFS. Based on these findings, patients were divided in a favorable
and an unfavorable prognosis group. The differences in median local PFS, overall
survival, and incidence of deteriorated hepatic function between the two groups were
11.2 months, 11.1 months, and 71.7%, respectively (p < 0.001 in each case). In
conclusion, we suggest that the optimal criteria of the radiotherapeutic parameters
for patients with unresectable locally advanced HCC are: PTV ≤ 279 cm3, total
dose > 60 Gy10, and NTNL-VBED20 ≤ 40.8%.

these limitations and improve clinical outcomes [4–9].
Although the Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Assessment Randomized Protocol and the Asia-Pacific
trial found that the sorafenib improved overall survival
compared with placebo, the survival benefit was modest
[10, 11]. In addition, many studies have suggested RT as
an effective treatment option for patients with unresectable
locally advanced HCC [12, 13]. A new strategy including
RT is therefore needed in the treatment of unresectable
locally advanced HCC.
However, to date, there are no clear guidelines as
to when and how it should best be used. In this study, we
have evaluated the clinical outcomes of RT in patients with
unresectable locally advanced HCC and have identified

INTRODUCTION
The standard treatments for unresectable
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib. TACE is
currently recommended for large multinodular HCC,
while sorafenib is the suggested first-line of treatment
for HCC with vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread.
There is now strong evidence that TACE enhances the
survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced
HCC [1, 2]. However, large tumors have an arterial and
portal blood supply, and hence, they might remain viable
after TACE and give rise to recurrence or metastasis [3].
Radiotherapy (RT) in addition to TACE could overcome

significantly associated with hepatic function deterioration.
These cut-off values were re-evaluated by using a receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve. For PTV, the
sensitivity was 0.553 and the specificity was 0.839, with
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.712 (p < 0.001). For
NTNL-VBED20, the sensitivity was 0.830 and the specificity
was 0.732, with an AUC of 0.817 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1).
The total dose (Gy10) was not significantly associated with
hepatic function deterioration (p = 0.056).
Based on a maximally selected log-rank test, a PTV
of 304 cm3 and a total dose of 60 Gy10 were also found to
be significantly associated with local PFS, and these cutoff values were re-evaluated by using the Cox regression
model (PTV of 304 cm3: HR = 2.092, CI = 1.353–3.234,
p = 0.002; total dose of 60 Gy10: HR = 1.824, CI = 1.116–
2.979, p = 0.017) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
(p < 0.001 and 0.015, respectively) (Figure 2).

RESULTS
Response, survival and hepatic function
deterioration
The median follow-up duration was 11.6 months
(range: 3.5–85.3 months), and 13 patients (12.6%) were
alive at the time of analysis. Complete or partial response
were achieved in 58 of 103 patients (56.3%), while stable
or progressive disease were observed in 45 of 103 patients
(43.7%). The median local progression-free survival
(PFS) duration was 9.0 months, and the 1-year and 2-year
local PFS rates were 41.5% and 16.5%, respectively. The
median overall PFS duration was 6.4 months, and the
1-year and 2-year overall PFS rates were 26.9% and 10.8%,
respectively. The median overall survival (OS) duration was
11.6 months, and the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 48.5%
and 23.4%, respectively. Hepatic function deterioration
occurred in 47 patients (45.6%).

Identifying the optimal criteria of
radiotherapeutic parameters
Patients were divided in four groups (group 1,
2, 3, and 4) based on a PTV of 279 cm3 and a NTNLVBED20 of 40.8%, which were identified as cut-off values
of significant radiotherapeutic parameters associated with
hepatic function deterioration. Table 1(A) shows local PFS,
overall PFS, OS, and the incidence of hepatic function
deterioration of these four groups. The best clinical
outcomes were achieved by group 1 (with PTV ≤ 279 cm3
and NTNL-VBED20 ≤ 40.8%), while the worst outcomes
were observed in group 4 (with PTV > 279 cm3 and

PFS, overall PFS, OS, and incidence of hepatic function
deterioration between group 1 and group 4 were 10.1
months, 3.2 months, 11.3 months, and 79.2%, respectively
(p = 0.007, 0.115, 0.057, and <0.001, respectively).
In addition, patients were divided in four groups
(group A, B, C, and D) based on a PTV of 304 cm3 and a
total dose of 60 Gy10, which were identified as cut-off values
of significant radiotherapeutic parameters associated with
local PFS. Table 1(B) shows local PFS, overall PFS, OS,
and incidence of hepatic function deterioration in these four
groups. The best clinical outcomes were achieved by patients
in group A (with PTV ≤ 304 cm3 and total dose > 60 Gy10)
and the worst outcomes were observed in group D (with
PTV > 304 cm3 and total dose ≤ 60 Gy10). The differences in

median local PFS, overall PFS, OS, and incidence of hepatic
function deterioration between group A and group D were
7.0 months, 3.1 months, 9.2 months, and 47.1%, respectively
(p = 0.005, 0.055, 0.009, and <0.001, respectively).
Based on these results, we merged group 1 and group
A in a favorable prognosis group (with PTV ≤ 279 cm3,
total dose > 60 Gy10 and NTNL-VBED20 ≤ 40.8%), while
group 4 and group D formed an unfavorable group
(with  40%) as an unfavorable group. These groups were
compared with respect to local PFS, overall PFS, OS,
and incidence of hepatic function deterioration (Table 2,
Figure 3). The differences in median local PFS, overall
PFS, OS, and incidence of hepatic function deterioration
between the favorable prognosis group and unfavorable
prognosis group were 11.2 months, 3.6 months,

[22]. A biologically effective dose (BED) of 60 Gy10, which
was also identified as a significant parameter in this study,
corresponds to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. A dose of 45–50
Gy or higher in conventional fractionations has generally
been used in the 3D-CRT studies, while 30–60 Gy in 3–5
fractions, similar to or higher than a BED of 60 Gy10,
has been used in the SBRT studies. Consistently, a BED
of 60 Gy10 in this study was considered the minimum
dose required to achieve a better local PFS. The NTNLVBED20 was a significant parameter associated with hepatic
function deterioration, which was identified in our previous
study [23]. Liang et al. suggested that V20 is an important
parameter in patients treated with hypofractionated RT (4–6
Gy per fraction) [24], and Son et al. demonstrated that V15 is
a significant parameter associated with increased CP score
[25]. When compared with V20 of 48.5% reported by Liang
et al. and V15 of 43.2% reported by Son et al., the VBED20
of 40.8% found in this study could be considered adequate.
Our toxicity results support the validity of this cut-off value
as there was a large difference in the incidence of hepatic
function deterioration between the favorable and unfavorable
prognosis group (3.3% vs. 75.0%).
In addition, the values of these parameters are
not fixed but can be varied in the treatment planning
phase. The parameters in this study were derived from
tomotherapy. When other treatment planning techniques,
such as 3D-CRT and fixed-beam IMRT, are used, the
distribution of low-to-moderate dose could differ from
that when tomotherapy is used; moreover, the distribution
of low-to-moderate dose in other treatments could affect
the value of these parameters. Therefore, PTV, total dose,
and NTNL-VBED20 all depend on the treatment techniques.
The use of compression devices, gated therapy, or imageguided radiotherapy (IGRT) for reducing respiratoryinduced tumor motion or allowing a more precise delivery
of radiation could allow a smaller PTV to be used. The
radiation dose and NTNL-VBED20 could also be improved
by using the IG-IMRT technique instead of 3D-CRT. The
values of these three parameters could be adjusted within
the favorable ranges during the treatment planning.
In conclusion, we suggest that the optimal criteria of
radiotherapeutic parameters for patients with unresectable
locally advanced HCC are: PTV ≤ 279 cm3, total dose
> 60 Gy10 and NTNL-VBED20 ≤ 40.8%. Because patients
who meet these criteria would derive the most benefit
from RT, the addition of RT to current standard modalities
should be considered. Further confirmation of these
findings should be sought in larger-scale studies.

DISCUSSION
Although the therapeutic role of RT in unresectable
locally advanced HCC has not been well established,
many studies have reported that it is safe and effective
for the treatment of HCC patients [5–9, 13–17]. Because
the improved gain of survival cannot be achieved in
all patients received RT, it is important to establish the
optimal criteria of radiotherapeutic parameters in order to
improve its efficacy. Therefore, we attempted to identify
the optimal cut-off values of radiotherapeutic parameters
associated with local PFS and hepatic function deterioration
to enhance its safety and efficacy. Among the possible
prognostic factors, we excluded the pretreatment ChildPugh (CP) score because only patients with a pretreatment
CP score of 5–7 were considered to be eligible for RT. A
PTV of 304 cm3 and a total dose of 60 Gy10 were found to
be cut-off values of significant radiotheraprutic parameters
associated with local PFS, and a PTV of 279 cm3 and a
NTNL-VBED20 of 40.8% were found to be cut-off values
of significant radiotheraprutic parameters associated with
hepatic function deterioration. Based on the values of these
three parameters, a favorable and an unfavorable prognosis
group were defined and compared. Local PFS, overall
PFS, OS, and incidence of hepatic function deterioration
were all better in the favorable prognosis group than that
in the unfavorable prognosis group (local PFS: 16.0 vs. 4.8
months; overall PFS: 7.9 vs. 4.3 months; OS: 17.9 vs. 6.8
months; incidence of hepatic function deterioration: 3.3%
vs. 75.0%). Our results demonstrated that optimizing the
selection of patients for RT resulted in an improvement in
both its safety and efficacy.
Dawson et al. reported that the best outcomes after
3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are achieved in
patients with fewer than 3 lesions that are less than 6 cm
in size with intact liver function [18]. Similary, Toramatsu
et al. found that when the nominal diameter of gross tumor
volume (GTV) is more than 6.3 cm, the average risk of
radiation-induced liver disease is 94.5% for intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) [19]. As for SBRT,
the optimal tumor size for RT is smaller. Takeda et al.
recommended combination therapy of TACE plus SBRT
for solitary tumors with a tumor volume less than 100 cc
[20]. Huang et al. found that OS is significantly lower in
patients with tumors larger than 4 cm (HR: 0.5, p = 0.028)
[21]. The PTV of 279 cm3 and 304 cm3 found in this study
are comparable with the GTV of about 6.5–7 cm diameter,
which is larger than the 4–5.5 cm diameter of tumor that
is recommended for SBRT, and with the GTV of 6.3 cm
recommended by Toramatsu et al. [19]. Chen et al. reported
that a higher dose (>50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) resulted in
better survival (median OS, 10.5 vs. 6.9 months, p < 0.001)

A total of 103 patients were eligible for this
study, all of whom received RT using the TomoTherapy
Hi-Art system (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison, WI, USA),
at Incheon St. Mary’s Hospital and Seoul St. Mary’s
Hospital, between March 2006 and February 2012. Patient
data were retrospectively reviewed following institutional
review board approval.
Age, sex, ECOG performance status, TNM stage,
pretreatment CP score, absence or presence of hepatitis or
liver cirrhosis, and level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were
evaluated. Prior to RT, TACE was performed in 95 patients
(median, 2 times; range, 1–11 times), percutaneous
ethanol injection (PEI) in 8 patients (median, 2 times;
range, 1–3 times), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in
8 patients (median, 2 times; range, 1–3 times), and
systemic chemotherapy in 14 patients. The patient
characteristics are shown in Table 3.

of the normal liver is unclear. In our previous study, we
determined the α/β ratio of the normal liver by comparing
the incidence of hepatic function deterioration between
2 different fractionation schemes of RT [23]. Therefore,
an α/β ratio of 8 was used for calculating the BED of
the normal liver in this study. NTNL-VBED20, which is
the fraction of the NTNL volume receiving more than a
BED of 20 Gy8, was identified as a predictive parameter
for hepatic function deterioration [23]. NTNL-VBED20 was
10.6–79.3% (median: 45.4%).
Treatment planning utilized the built-in software
of the TomoTherapy Planning Station, which was
used for the TomoTherapy Hi-Art system. We
evaluated the dose-volume histogram and the dose
distributions slice by slice. We then approved the
treatment plan if the tumor coverage was adequate
and the doses to the surrounding normal tissues were
within acceptable limits. Megavoltage cone-beam
CT was performed during each treatment session
before actual beam delivery. The patient set-up
and position were corrected using automated image
registration, and the anatomical accuracy was always
evaluated by a radiation oncologist.

Radiotherapy
For simulation, patients were immobilized using
the BodyFix system (Medical Intelligence GmbH,
Schwabmunchen, Germany), in which the abdomen
was compressed at low pressure using foil. A spiral
computed tomography (CT) scan was then performed with
intravenous contrast and a 2.5 mm slice thickness, using
either a SOMATOM (Siemens, Berlin, Germany) or a
LightSpeed RT16 (GE, Waukesha, WI, USA) CT scanner.
The GTV was defined as the tumor volume
enhanced in the arterial phase and diluted in the delayed
phase of the CT scan. The PTV was generated by
adding 5–15 mm to the GTV in 71 of the 103 patients,
facilitating asymmetric margin expansion in order to
reduce irradiation to the stomach, duodenum, and small
intestine. In the remaining 32 patients, 4-dimensional
(4D) CT was performed to generate the internal target
volume in order to compensate for respiration-induced
liver movement due to the installation of 4D-CT in March
2009 at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital and in March 2011 at
Incheon St. Mary’s Hospital. Organs at risk, such as the
total liver, NTNL, stomach, duodenum, intestine, kidney,
and spinal cord, were also contoured for evaluation of the
irradiated dose. The NTNL volume was defined as the
total liver volume minus the PTV.
The PTV was 330.1 ± 275.1 cm3, and the normal
liver volume was 1209.7 ± 426.9 cm3. The dose per
fraction to the PTV was 1.8–5 Gy, and the total dose
was 40–60 Gy (median: 50 Gy), prescribed to 95% of
the PTV. Forty-one patients (39.8%) were treated with
1.8–2.5 Gy per fraction, while 62 patients (60.2%) were
treated with 4–5 Gy per fraction. The total dose delivered
to the target was converted to a BED, based on the linearquadratic model with an α/β ratio of 10, and the total dose
was 50.5–82.5 Gy10 (median: 73.5 Gy10). The α/β ratio

Evaluation and statistical analysis
Tumor response was defined as the best response in
the dynamic CT scans obtained 1 month and 3 months
after RT, according to the modified Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors [27]. PFS was measured from the
date of RT to the date of progression or the last follow-up.
OS was measured from the date of RT to the date of death
or the last follow-up.
We considered local PFS and hepatic function
deterioration as clinically relevant responses to RT.
Hepatic function deterioration was defined as an increase
of at least 2 points in the CP score within 3 months after
completing RT. An increase in the CP score reflects hepatic
function deterioration, and this increase has been used for
the assessment of hepatic toxicity after treatment for liver
diseases [23, 25–28].
We evaluated the PTV, NTNL-VBED20, and total
dose (Gy10) as significant parameters affecting the hepatic
function. Maximally selected chi-square test was used
for evaluating PTV, NTNL-VBED20, and total dose (Gy10)
and identifing their cut-off values. The results were
re-evaluated by using a ROC curve. We also evaluated
PTV and total dose (Gy10) as significant parameters
affecting local PFS. The cut-off values were calculated
using maximally selected log-rank test and the results
were re-evaluated with the Cox regression model and
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
Based on these results, patients were divided in four
groups according to the cut-off values of radiotherapeutic
parameters associated with local PFS or hepatic function
deterioration, respectively, and local PFS, overall PFS,
