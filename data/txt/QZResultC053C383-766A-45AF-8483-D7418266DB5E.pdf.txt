ABSTRACT
Somatic mutations found within the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of the human
epidermal growth factor (HER) family of receptors have been implicated in the
development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, no
conclusive reports have described pathogenic mutations in kinase-impaired HER3.
Here, we report a case of an advanced chemotherapy-resistant NSCLC, harboring a
novel HER3V855A somatic mutation homologous to the EGFRL858Ractivating mutation. Coexpression of HER3V855A and wild-type HER2 enhances ligand-induced transformation
of murine and human cell lines, while HER-targeted inhibitors potently suppress
mutant HER3 activity. Consistent with these observations, in silico computational
modeling predicts that mutant V855A alters the kinase domain and c-terminal end
of the HER3 protein. Taken together, these findings provide a basis for the clinical
exploration of targeted therapies in HER3 mutant NSCLC and by extrapolation, in
other cancers that more frequently carry somatic HER3 mutations.

INTRODUCTION

NSCLCs [2], highly predict the efficacy of small molecule
EGFR or pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with
response rates as high as 70% seen in multiple randomized
studies [6-8]. HER2 driver mutations, on the other hand,
are found in less than 2% of NSCLCs [2]. EGFR and
HER2 mutation prevalence varies according to patient/
tumor selection criteria. Tumor cells that harbor HER2
mutations exhibit preclinical and clinical sensitivity to the
pan-HER inhibitor afatinib [9-11]. The few lung cancerderived HER4 kinase mutations reported to date have
not been extensively studied. HER4 has an attenuating
role in HER signaling and mutations rather create a loss
of function [12, 13]. While HER3 mutations have been
reported in some human cancers [14, 15], no conclusive

The identification of activating somatic kinase
domain mutations in the human epidermal growth factor
(HER) or the human erythroblastoma virus B (ErbB)
family of trans-membrane receptors, which consists of the
four homologous members EGFR (HER1; ErbB1), HER2
(ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4), has enabled
major advancement in the treatment of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) [1, 2]. These mutations identified
in EGFR, HER2 [2] and HER4 [3], cluster around
their intracellular catalytic tyrosine kinase domain and
contribute to disease pathogenesis [2, 4, 5]. EGFR kinase
domain mutations present in approximately 5-10% of all

reports to date have described HER3-related pathogenic
mutations in lung cancer [16-18].
HER3 is unique among the HER receptor family
members as it is generally considered to lack or have
impaired tyrosine kinase activity due to the absence of
critical amino acid residues within its kinase domain
securing it in an inactive conformation [18-21]. Despite
this perceived absence of intrinsic tyrosine kinase
activation, HER3 plays a critical role in the signaling of the
other HER members. Unlike other HER receptors, HER3
does not form stable ligand-induced homodimers [22], but
upon ligand binding acts as an allosteric activator of its
other HER partners, particularly HER2. This activation
results in the propagation of a potent signaling cascade
[18, 20, 23] and can also play a role in carcinogenesis
[24, 25]. In addition, HER3 contains six binding sites for
the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) that are not present in EGFR or HER2, establishing
HER3 as a strong intermediary for PI3K/AKT signaling
[18, 26].
Here, we report on a novel V855A mutation located
in exon 21 of the HER3 tyrosine kinase domain and found
in the tumor specimen of an adolescent patient with a
chemotherapy-resistant advanced NSCLC. Interestingly,

this mutation maps at a position homologous to the
prevalent EGFR-L858R driver mutation [27] and we thus
hypothesized that this mutant HER3 may have a functional
impact. We demonstrate that HER3-V855A alters HER3
protein structure and confers a gain-of-function phenotype
when co-expressed with HER2 but not with EGFR. We
also demonstrate that HER-specific therapeutics can
effectively suppress mutant V855A transforming potential.
These preclinical results provide a rationale for the clinical
exploration of anti-HER therapies in HER3 mutant lung
cancer and by extrapolation in other cancers that more
frequently harbor HER3 somatic mutations.

immunohistochemical profile of the tumor (CK7 and TTF1
positive) suggested a primary origin from the lung. Further
screening via computed tomography (CT) revealed the
presence of a primary lesion in the left bronchus (Fig. 1a).
The screening also demonstrated severe metastatic spread
with multiple thoracic and abdominal adenopathies and

differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating the normal

NSCLC with a documented EGFR kinase mutation.
Patients were pre-selected on the basis of 2 criteria:
adenocarcinoma with little or no smoking history. Patients
with an EGFR mutation in their tumor were then treated
with erlotinib (150mg/day) until progression [28]. DNA
isolated from formalin-fixed lung cancer biopsy samples,
including the specimen from the 14 year old male patient,
were screened for mutations in the kinase domain (exons
18 through 21) of all four HER family genes by the
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method
that detects as low as 5% mutant species in a wild-type
background [29]. Additional screening was also performed
on exons previously reported to harbor hotspot mutations
in KRAS and BRAF [2]. From a total of 210 screened
samples, eighteen previously reported EGFR pathogenic
mutations (n=55) and two (n=5) previously reported HER2
insertion mutations were identified [29]. As depicted in

the lung cancer specimen of the 14-year-old case-study
revealed a double peak at nucleotide c.2564 located in
exon 21 of the HER3 gene (NM_001982). This indicated
the presence of a mutated allele with a T-to-C base-pair
substitution, predicted to substitute valine (GTG) to
alanine (GCG) at codon 855 (p. Val855Ala; NP_001973)
of the HER3 activation loop. The HER3-V855A mutation
was detected in the tumor sample, but was not found in
the patient’s peripheral blood DNA (Fig. 1e), confirming
that the mutation was of somatic origin. Additional
genomic analysis of the patient’s lung tumor specimen
did not reveal any additional mutations in the other tested
genes. The disease progressed despite treatment with
VIDE (vincristin, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide)
although there was an initial objective response.
Unfortunately, demise occurred before the patient could
be included by amendment in an exploratory lung cancer
phase II study with afatinib [11].

less dramatic response than the exon 19 deletion mutation
[27].
To analyze the location and significance of the
novel HER3-V855A mutation, we performed protein
sequence alignment of exon 21 of the EGFR and HER3.
Although, the amino acid at position 855 in HER3 is not
conserved relative to EGFR, the mutated amino acid
remarkably maps at a position analogous to the location
of the EGFR-L858R mutation (Fig. 2a). Further analysis
with the Mutagrator kinase mutation interpretation tool
[32] reveals that the mutated V855 residue also has
positional homology to the lung cancer-derived BRAFL597V kinase mutation [33] (Fig. 2b). BRAF-L597V
is classified as an intermediate kinase active variant
(approximately100 fold elevated BRAF activity compared
to wild-type) that modestly increases ERK activation [34].
The mutated residue is also highly conserved across HER3
homologs among different mammalian species (data not
shown), which further indicates that the V855A mutation
may have a functional effect. In addition, analysis of the
crystal structure of the HER3 kinase domain depicting
the mapped location of the mutated residue, demonstrates
its functional relevance. The V855 residue is part of a
conserved sequence motif (also includes L858 and L859)
which stabilizes the inactive position of the αC helix [20]
(Fig. 2c), and we propose that the amino acid substitution
may likely affect protein kinase activity.

Homology between the HER3-V855A and EGFRL858R kinase mutation
EGFR pathogenic mutations sensitize in varying
degrees to inhibition by small molecule TKIs [27]. These
mutations include both class I short in-frame deletions and
class II missense mutations. One of these mutations, the
L858R(Leucine → Arginine) missense mutation occurs
at a highly conserved amino acid among protein kinases
and is found in exon 21 of the EGFR kinase domain [30].
In addition, this single nucleotide substitution has the
highest prevalence of any activating EGFR kinase domain
missense mutation, accounting for approximately 41% of
EGFR kinase mutations [31]. Moreover, EGFR-L858R
leads to increased sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, albeit with

when combined with its HER2 dimerization partner
[19]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the HER3 kinase
mutation may cause a pathogenic phenotype when coexpressed with HER2 in a cellular system. To this end, we
used the Ba/F3 model system to determine the functional
impact of HER3-V855A. Ba/F3 cells are dependent on
interleukin-3 (IL-3) for mitogenesis and lack endogenous
expression of all the HER receptors (although very
low HER3 expression has been detected in reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies
[35]), enabling us to focus on the properties of the mutant
HER3 in a basically null background. Ba/F3 cells were
co-transfected with vectors encoding differing forms of
the HER receptors (wild-type HER2, wild-type HER3 or
mutant HER3). Stable cell populations were screened by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and selected
based on matched expression level (within two fold levels)
of their relevant HER at the cell surface (Fig. 3a).
To determine the transforming potential of HER3V855A in the context of IL-3 -independent growth, Ba/
F3 transfectants were grown in the absence or presence
of IL-3, or HER cognate ligands (neuregulin1β (NRG1β)
or transforming growth factor α (TGFα)).NRG1β is a key
activator of HER3 and its expression by NSCLC cells
has been described to promote autocrine activation of the
HER2/HER3 complex [36]. In contrast, TGFα activates
EGFR and is highly expressed in NSCLC [37]. As shown
in Fig. 3b, Ba/F3 cells singly expressing wild-type HER3
or mutant HER3-V855A were unable to grow in IL-3
free culture conditions, even when supplemented with
NRG1β or TGFα ligands. On the other hand, while still
no growth response was observed when co-expressing
each HER3 construct with wild-type HER2 in absence
of IL-3, a significantly increased growth response upon
NRG1β stimulation was observed with the mutant HER3
combination compared to the wild-type combination (p
< 0.01). The extent of NRG1β-induced growth in the
HER3-V855A/HER2 co-transfectant was even greater
than levels observed in IL-3 treatment conditions (Fig.
3b). Furthermore, treatment with TGFα did not induce
a growth response in both wild-type and mutant HER3
co-transfectants (Fig. 3b), further confirming that the
presence of a HER3-specific cognate ligand is required to
promote HER3/HER2 biological activity.
To assess the ability of HER3-V855A to form
colonies we performed a methyl cellulose-based colony
formation assay. As shown in Fig 3c & 3d, while NRG1β
treatment did not induce an increase in colony number
between the wild-type and mutant HER3 co-transfectants,
colony size was significantly greater inHER3-V855A
compared to wild-type HER3 (p < 0.001). The colony
size upon NRG1β treatment was approximately 25-fold
greater than under IL-3 treatment with the mutant HER3
co-transfectant (Fig. 3d).
We also investigated the functional relevance of
stable Ba/F3 transfectants co-expressing HER3-V855A
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and EGFR (Supplemental Fig. 1a). While Ba/F3 cells
co-expressing HER3-V855A and EGFR exerted a robust
growth response to TGFα treatment (Supplemental Fig.
1b), they were unable to form colonies with the same
treatment (Supplemental Fig. 1c). In contrast, Ba/F3
cells co-expressing wild-type HER3 and EGFR not only
formed colonies in the presence of TGFα (Supplemental
Fig. 1c), but also demonstrated equal TGFα-induced
growth response compared to the mutant HER3-V855A
combination (Supplemental Fig. 1b). These data suggest
that the pathogenic effects associated with the HER3V855A mutation is not induced by heterodimerization
with EGFR (upon TGFα stimulation).
We next examined the effect of chronic treatment
with NRG1β on HER3/HER2 phosphorylation and
their downstream targets AKT and ERK 1/2 in the Ba/
F3 co-transfectants. As shown in Figure 3e, a five-day
chronic treatment with NRG1β specifically increased
levels of phosphorylated HER3 and AKT in HER3V855A compared to wild-type HER3. In contrast, while
chronic NRG1β treatment induced HER2 and ERK1/2
phosphorylation in HER3-V855A, their levels were
not enhanced compared to wild-type. Of note, chronic
treatment with NRG1β neither induced HER3 or HER2
phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells expressing HER3-V855A
combined with a kinase-dead (KD) HER2 isoform
(Supplemental Fig. 2b). This finding further reveals that
a competent HER2 receptor is required for mutant V855A
transforming activity.

HER3V855A enhances neuregulin 1β-induced transphosphorylation of HER2WT
Tyrosine trans-phosphorylation is a major event
in HER signaling [38]. To examine if HER3-V855A
enhances trans-phosphorylation of HER2, we performed
immunoblot analysis on Ba/F3 and HEK 293Tlysates after
16hr incubation in serum-free conditions followed by10
minute acute ligand stimulation. HER3-V855A enhanced
trans-phosphorylation of HER2 at Y1248 in both Ba/F3
and HEK 293T cells after NRG1β stimulation (Fig. 4a and
4b).
In addition, while acute treatment with NRG1β
was essential for the induction of HER3 phosphorylation
in wild-type and mutant HER3 co-transfectants, HER3
phosphorylation was absent in similar treatment conditions
with corresponding single transfectants (Fig. 4a and
supplemental Fig. 3a). NRG1β-induced phosphorylation
of mutant HER3 was strongly enhanced in HEK 293T
cells, whereas the observed effect in Ba/F3 transfectants
was more modest (Fig. 4a and 4b). Likewise, a modest
increase in ligand-induced phosphorylation of HER2
and HER3 was observed in transformed H292 cells
(Supplemental Fig 3b). H292 cells are NSCLC cells that
display similar mucoepidermoid features as normal lung

experiments (see Fig. 3), TGFα was unable to induce HER

interacts with the mutant HER3 complex in the absence of
NRG1β (with no observed effects with ligand stimulation),
while NRG1β stimulation is needed for interaction with
the wild-type HER3 protein (Fig. 5b). Of note, the cell
surface protein expression of HER2 is much higher than
HER3 in the transfected Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 3a). This thus
infers that a smaller fraction of the HER3 complex is
pulled down in Fig. 5b, and may also result in differences
in the amount of proteins stimulated by NRG1β.

Enhanced interaction of HER2 with HER3V855A
To further confirm that the V855A mutation
provides increased activity to HER3 through enhanced
physical interaction with HER2, we performed coimmunoprecipitaton experiments on Ba/F3 cotransfectants stimulated with or without NRG1β (10
minutes) after 1 hr serum starvation. Pull down of
HER3 on HER2 immunoprecipitates revealed enhanced
interaction of HER2 with HER3-V855A relative to wildtype HER3, specifically after incubation with NRG1β
(Fig 5a). Interestingly, reciprocal analysis with HER3
immunoprecipitates demonstrates that HER2 already

inhibitors include: erlotinib, an FDA approved reversible
TKI indicated for the treatment of advanced NSCLC
and pancreatic cancer, afatinib, a second generation
irreversible ErbB family blocker also approved for
the treatment of advanced NSCLC and pertuzumab, a
monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular region
of HER2 preventing it from dimerizing with its other HER
partners and approved for the treatment of HER2 amplified
breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab [39-41].
To assess the inhibitory effect of these molecules on cell
growth, Ba/F3 transfectants growing in NRG1β containing
medium were treated with increasing concentrations of
these inhibitors for a period of seven days. Afatinib and
pertuzumab each demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting
the growth of Ba/F3 cells co-expressing HER3-V855A
and wild-type HER2 (Fig. 6a), with IC50 values of < 1
nmol/L and < 1μg/mL respectively (Table 1). Erlotinib,
on the other hand, had a much weaker inhibitory effect on
the mutant V855A combination (Fig. 6a) with a calculated
IC50 value of 344±4nmol/L (Table 1). Ba/F3 cells coexpressing wild-type forms of HER3 and HER2 were
highly resistant to erlotinib treatment (7000±106 nmol/L),
but displayed sensitivity to afatinib with an IC50 value of
208 ± 39nmol/L, two logs less sensitive than the mutant
form (Table 1).
To assess the effect of the inhibitors on colony
formation, Ba/F3 co-transfectants were seeded onto
methyl-cellulose and treated with HER inhibitors in
the presence of NRG1β. As shown in Fig 6b, afatinib
(100 nmol/L) and pertuzumab (5µg/mL) were effective
in suppressing the formation of colonies in wild-type
HER3 and mutant V855A co-transfectants. As expected,
erlotinib (100nmol/L) was less effective than the other
HER inhibitors in suppressing colony formation. The
HER3-V855A co-transfectantformed significantly smaller

colonies (7.2 ± 1.4) compared to the wild-type HER3
combination (78.9 ± 13.7) under erlotinib treatment (Fig.
5b and 5c).
We further examined the effects of the inhibitors
on HER-related signaling activity and survival using
the Ba/F3 model system. Afatinib (100nmol/L) potently
inhibited NRG1β-induced phosphorylation of HER3, wild
type HER2 and AKT (Fig. 6d). Pertuzumab (5 µg/mL)
treatment induced less potent effects compared to afatinib,
with significant reduction seen in mutant HER3 and wildtype HER2 phosphorylation, but not in active levels of
AKT (Fig. 5d). Treatment with erlotinib (100nmol/L)
also inhibited the HER pathway, albeit less potently than
afatinib or pertuzumab treatment (Fig. 6d). As determined
by the annexin-V/7-AAD binding assay, treatment with
afatinib in the presence of NRG1β induced a two-fold
higher fraction of apoptotic cells compared to vehicle
conditions (30.3 ± 0.6%). Erlotinib and pertuzumab were
less effective, yielding respectively a 20.4 ± 0.29% and
13.9±0.6% increase in apoptotic cells compared to vehicle
(Fig. 5e). All tested inhibitors were also less effective in
suppressing HER-related activity and survival in the
wild-type HER3/HER2 co-transfectant (Fig. 5d and 5e),
indicating that tumors harboring HER3-V855A may
predict response to targeted therapy.

Impact of V855A on HER3 protein structure
To elucidate and predict the impact of mutant V855A
on the conformation of the wild-type HER3, protein
modeling was performed via the automated I-TASSER

by submitting the PDB files to Mode Refiner server

differences. In addition, we compared moderefined
predicted wild-type HER3 with the crystallography

differed from the crystallography obtained model,

Taken together, these data suggest that the V855A

with a malignant phenotype.

DISCUSSION

from our cellular models demonstrate that HER3-V855A
strongly enhances NRG1β-induced trans-activation of
HER2 compared to wild-type HER3. Enhanced transactivation of HER receptor activity appears to be a central
event in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation by lungcancer derived EGFR/HER mutations [36]. This activation
nonetheless requires a competent HER2 kinase, as our
data also reveal that HER3-V855A is unable to induce
trans-activation of kinase-dead HER2. This finding thus
indicates that HER3 phosphorylation in cells expressing
mutant V855A requires the catalytic activity of HER2.
A recent study by Littlefield and colleauges has
demonstrated that cancer-associated HER3 variants may
not increase the catalytic activity of HER3, but may
possibly increase the allosteric activator function and
interaction of HER3 to its dimerization partner [48].
Our co-immunoprecipitaton experiments support these
findings, where we demonstrate enhanced interaction
between the wild-type HER2 protein complex and
mutant HER3. This enhanced interaction between the two
dimerization partners can consequently lead to increased
activation, alterations of the angle of the ATP binding
cleft and a more pronounced sensitivity to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors [49].
On the other hand, HER3-V855A combined with
EGFR does not enhance ligand-induced transformation
of Ba/F3 cells. Whereas wild-type HER3 combined
with EGFR is able to form colonies under chronic TGFα
treatment, the mutant HER3-V855A combination does
not. Our findings thus demonstrate that mutant V855A can
be delineated into two distinct phenotypes, depending on
which HER receptor it associates with. The mechanism,
however, behind these differing effects is currently
unknown. [48]. Some theoretical possibilities could be due
to (1) phosphotransferase activity occurring either through
a dissociative (inactivating) or associative (activating)
state [50] when mutant V855A is coupled with EGFR or
HER2 respectively, or (2) a weaker ligand-induced transphosporylation of HER3 by EGFR. In line with this, Shi
et al. present data showing that HER3-V855A on its own
reduces mant [2′-(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)] -ATP
binding compared to the wild-type HER3 protein [20].
While the observations of Shi et al. implicate mutant
V855A as a suppressor of HER3 kinase activity, further
work is needed to establish its capacity to bind ATP when
influenced by its relevant HER dimerization partner.
Our analysis also shows that inhibitors targeting
the extracellular and kinase domain of the HER receptors
are effective in suppressing HER3-V855Adriven activity,
albeit with differing potency. As expected, afatinib was
more effective than erlotinib in suppressing growth and
survival signals due to its target specificity and ability to
irreversibly bind to the HER kinase. It should be noted,
however, that HER3 lacks a conserved cysteine group
found in the kinase domain of the other HER family
members that is essential for effective binding of afatinib

We report a unique case of an adolescent patient with
advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung harboring aHER3V855A kinase mutation in his tumor specimen. Although
HER3 mutations have been identified and characterized
in colon and gastric cancers [45], no published studies to
our knowledge have reported the occurrence of clinically
relevant lung cancer-derived mutations. In addition, we
present evidence that the HER3-V855A mutation confers
a gain-of-function phenotype and is highly sensitive
to HER inhibitors afatinib and pertuzumab. No other
examined mutations (EGFR, HER2, HER4, KRAS or
BRAF) were found in the lung tumor specimen of the
patient, suggesting that HER3-V855Ais the primary driver
for the lung cancer pathogenesis. Our data also strongly
suggests that the poor therapeutic response to combination
chemotherapy could have been circumvented by molecular
targeted therapy. In addition, this mutation is rare as it
was found once in a systematic screen of 210 lung cancer
specimens phenotypically enriched for adenocarcinoma in
patients with non- or limited smoking history.
The V855A mutation targets the activation loop of
the HER3 gene and is homologous to the EGFR-L858R
mutation. Amino acid substitutions that have an impact
on the biophysical or structural properties of a protein
have been described to be pathogenic or deleterious [46].
We demonstrate with protein modeling that the valine to
alanine substitution at position 855 has an impact on the
kinase domain and carboxyl-terminal end of the wild-type
HER3 protein. Based on this in silico approach, mutant
V855A may thus confer a pathogenic phenotype by
destabilizing wild-type HER3.
As demonstrated by prior studies [47] and confirmed
by us, the EGFR-L858R mutation is able to transform Ba/
F3 cells to IL-3 independent growth and constitutively
enhances EGFR autophosphorylation as a homodimer.
However, HER3-V855A is unable to transform Ba/
F3 cells to either IL-3 independent or ligand-induced
growth as a homodimer. Rather, it must associate with its
preferred dimerization partner, HER2, upon binding of an
exogenous substrate such as NRG1β in order to transform
Ba/F3 cells. Multiple lines of evidence support this
finding, demonstrating that the wild-type HER3 receptor’s
impaired kinase activity can be circumvented by ligandinduced heterodimerization; preferably with its HER2
partner [19, 23]. Jaiswal et al. also demonstrated that the
major colon/gastric cancer-derived HER3 mutants depend
on HER2 for their oncogenic activity, but in contrast to our
findings these mutants promote transformation in a ligandindependent manner [45].
The transforming potential of HER3-V855A
compared to wild-type HER3 was confirmed by its ability
to increase ligand-induced coupling of signal transducers
that mediate proliferative and pro-survival responses,
indicating a gain-of-function phenotype. Functional data

[9]. Afatinib is thus able to exert its potency by inhibiting
the trans-activation of HER2 by HER3. Pertuzumab,
an inhibitor targeting HER2 dimerization, was also
effective in suppressing the transforming potential of
mutant V855A; further indicating that coupling with
HER2 is essential for its oncogenic activity. Conversely,
trastuzumab (an inhibitor targeting the HER2 extracellular
domain), is ineffective in blocking mutant V855A activity
(unpublished data not included in this report). Previous
studies have shown that while pertuzumab efficiently
blocks ligand-induced HER3/HER2 heterodimerization
[51], trastuzumab is more effective in blocking ligandindependent HER3/HER2 interactions [52]. These findings
are consistent with results presented by the research group
of Jaiswal in the framework of ligand-independent mutant
HER3 [45]. All tested inhibitors exhibited less potent
effects of transformed Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type
HER3 combined with HER2 upon NRG1β stimulation.
This provides a strong biological rationale in establishing
mutant V855A as a predictive marker in the context of
response to HER targeted therapy. Accordingly, our
results will also be useful in evaluating targeted treatment
approaches in ongoing clinical trials for patients with
mutant HER3 NSCLC (CTBE2013000234; HER3LungNCT02134015).
In conclusion, the identification of HER3-V855A
and its functional properties for the first time clearly
implicates genomic HER3 activation in the pathogenesis
of lung cancer. HER3 is traditionally referred to as a
kinase-dead or kinase-impaired HER family member
due to evolutionary divergence at critical residues within
its kinase domain [18]. The capacity of a single amino
acid substitution in the HER3 kinase to enhance transactivation of HER2 opens up the possibility that other
regulatory mechanisms can be involved in its catalytic
function. Our findings thus establish the HER3 kinase
as a target for cancer therapy and support its continued
assessment and validation as a potential therapeutic
modality for personalized-tailored cancer treatment.

genetic testing or results classified as inconclusive due to
a low amount of malignant cells in tumor specimen were
excluded from the analysis (n=65).All patients provided
separate written informed consent for genetic analysis of
their tumor specimens and subsequent inclusion in the
treatment phase of the study.

Mutational screening
Mutation analysis was performed on DNA extracted
from three consecutive 10µm thick sections of formalin
fixed and paraffin embedded tissue. Tissue sections
were examined to verify the presence of a sufficient
amount of malignant cells and manually macro-dissected
when necessary. Tissue area ranged from 1 mm2 to 600
mm2, although 40% of the sections were smaller than 5
mm2 (mostly needle biopsies). The mutation screening
assay at that time (2006) was based on the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-derived denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) method that covered the genomic
regions that encode the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 1821) of all 4 HER family genes. DGGE is a very sensitive
method that can detect mutant DNA species based on
the differential melting properties of homoduplex and
heteroduplex PCR fragments with abnormally migrating
bands revealing the presence of a genomic variant[29,
53, 54]. Samples were also analyzed for the presence of
somatic mutations of BRAF (exons 11 and 15) and KRAS
(exon 2).Mutations were confirmed by Sanger dideoxyterminator sequencing according to established methods.

DNA constructs and site-directed mutagenesis
The pcDNA3.1 HER3 hygro (+) expression plasmid
kindly provided by Dr. M. Rødland (Espen Stang Institute
of Pathology, Oslo Norway) was constructed as previously
described [47, 55]. Likewise, the pErbB3-eCFP expression
vector was provided by Dr. Rong-Hua Tao (Okinawa
Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa Japan) and
was constructed as described [56]. To construct pHER2FLAG-CMV-14, a fragment encoding the full length
sequence of HER2 with a Hind III site at the N terminus
and Xba I site at the C terminus was PCR amplified.
The resulting PCR fragment was digested with Hind III
and Xba I and subsequently cloned into the p3xFLAGCMV-14 vector. pcDNA 3.1 neo (+) expressing full length
HER2 or HER2-K753M (kinase-dead) was constructed
as previously described [57]. pcDNA3.1hygro (+) was
purchased from Invitrogen and pcDNA3HER2 neo (+)
was obtained from Addgene Inc. The HER3-V855A
mutation was generated by the Gene TailorTM SiteDirected Mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions with modifications. Mutagenic
oligonucleotides were designed using standard primer
design procedures and synthesized by Eurogentec. All

For drug inhibition studies, the cells were pre-treated
with various concentrations of the indicated drugs and
subsequently stimulated with 100ng/mL of the indicated
HER cognate ligands. After 7 days, the numbers of viable
cells were analyzed at an absorbance of 490nm using
a96-well microplate reader (Labsystems) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. All drug treatment conditions
were compared to the vehicle control. IC50 values were

mutated constructs were verified by restriction- digestion
and sequencing analysis. Primer sequences are available
upon request.

Cell culture
Ba/F3 cells kindly provided by Dr. J. Jiang (DanaFarber Cancer Institute), were maintained in RPMI 1640
(Gibco, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 10 units/mL penicillin, 10 µg/mL streptomycin
and interleukin-3 (Sigma) at 10ng/mL. To generate
stable polyclonal cell populations, Ba/F3 cells were
electroporated at 220V/1500mF (SEDD electropore
2000) with 20µg of a single expression vector or 10µg
each for paired combinations. Each of the expression
vectors was linearized with restriction endonucleases
before transfection. Transfected cells were selected in the
presence of 1200µg/mL G418 or 1200 µg/mL hygromycin
for single transfections or 1000µg/mL G418 + 1000µg/mL
hygromycin for co-transfections. Stable polyclonal cell
lines were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis using EGFR, HER2 (BD Biosciences) and HER3
(R&D systems) specific antibodies and cultured for further
study.HEK 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection)
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 10 units/mL penicillin and 10μg/mL
streptomycin. NCI-H292 cells (American Type Culture

with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

HER tyrosine phosphorylation, immunoprecipitation,
and Western blot
To analyze tyrosine phosphorylationof HER
proteins, Ba/F3 transfectants were incubated at 37oC for
16 hours in serum free conditions to obtain basal tyrosine
phosphorylation. Aliquots containing 4x106 cells were
stimulated with their indicated HER cognate ligand
for 10 min and lysed in a Tris-buffer [25 mmol/L TrisHCL (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton-x, 5ug/
mL leupeptin]containing a protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by
centrifugation and protein concentration was determined
by the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and equivalent
amount of protein were loaded on a 7.5% resolving
acrylamide gel and blotted on a polyvinyliden fluoride
membrane (PVDF). The membrane was then subjected
to an immunodetection procedure using the indicated
antibodies:phospho-HER2 (Tyr 1248), phospho-HER3
(Tyr 1289), HER2, HER3 and AKT/PKB from Cell
Signaling, phospho-AKT⁄PKB (Ser 473) from Invitrogen,
and β-actin from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare;
Cell Signaling) and a chemoluminescent detection kit
(Perkin-Elmer) were used to detect the indicated proteins.
To assess the inhibition of HER tyrosine phosphorylation
and their downstream targets, Ba/F3 transfectants were
incubated at 37oC for 16 hours in serum free conditions.
The cells were then incubated for 2 hours at 37oC with
required inhibitors followed by10 minute stimulation
with NRG1β. Cells were subsequently collected and
used for Western blot analysis as described. To assess the
protein-protein interaction between HER3 and HER2, Ba/
F3 transfectants were stimulated for 10 minutes with or
without 100ng/ml NRG1β after one hour incubation in
serum free conditions and precipitated with the 5μg of
the indicated antibodies and 75μl of G Sepharose beads
(GE healthcare). The precipitates were eluted with SDS
sample buffer /DTT and subjected to Western blot analysis
as described.

Inhibitors
The reversible HER-specific TKI erlotinib
(Tarceva®) and HER2-specific monoclonal antibody,
pertuzumab (Perjeta®) were provided by Roche. The panHER/ErbB TKI afatinib (BIBW 2992) was provided by
Boehringer Ingelheim. Stock solutions of erlotinib and
afatinib were prepared at a concentration of 10 mmol/L
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −80°C.
The drugs were diluted to a working concentration of
1mmol/L in DMSO before each experiment with a final
concentration of 0.1% DMSO used in all experiments.

Growth assays
Cell growth was assessed by the colorimetric
tetrazolium MTS assay (Promega). Ba/F3 transfectants,
cells were seeded in clear-bottomed 96-well plates at a
density of 1x104cells/ well in triplicates or quadruplets.
