Abstract

Author Manuscript

Genotypic differences greatly influence susceptibility and resistance to disease. Understanding
genotype-phenotype relationships requires that phenotypes be viewed as manifestations of
network properties, rather than simply as the result of individual genomic variations1. Genome
sequencing efforts have identified numerous germline mutations associated with cancer
predisposition and large numbers of somatic genomic alterations2. However, it remains
challenging to distinguish between background, or “passenger” and causal, or “driver” cancer
mutations in these datasets. Human viruses intrinsically depend on their host cell during the course
of infection and can elicit pathological phenotypes similar to those arising from mutations3. To
test the hypothesis that genomic variations and tumour viruses may cause cancer via related
mechanisms, we systematically examined host interactome and transcriptome network
perturbations caused by DNA tumour virus proteins. The resulting integrated viral perturbation
data reflects rewiring of the host cell networks, and highlights pathways that go awry in cancer,
such as Notch signalling and apoptosis. We show that systematic analyses of host targets of viral
proteins can identify cancer genes with a success rate on par with their identification through
functional genomics and large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations. Together, these
complementary approaches result in increased specificity for cancer gene identification.
Combining systems-level studies of pathogen-encoded gene products with genomic approaches
will facilitate prioritization of cancer-causing driver genes so as to advance understanding of the
genetic basis of human cancer.

Integrative studies of viral proteins have identified host perturbations relevant to viral
disease aetiology4,5. We examined whether such a strategy extended systematically across a
range of tumour viruses could shed light on cancers even beyond those directly caused by
these pathogens. Our hypothesis is inspired by classical examples where DNA tumour virus
proteins physically target the products of RB1 or TP53, two well-established germlineinherited and somatically-inactivated tumour-suppressor genes6. We propose that viruses
and genomic variations alter local and global properties of cellular networks in similar ways
to cause pathological states. Models derived from host perturbations mediated by viral
proteins representing the virome7 should serve as surrogates for network perturbations that
result from large numbers of genomic variations, or the variome8 (Fig. 1a).

Author Manuscript

We used an integrated pipeline to systematically investigate perturbations of host
interactome and transcriptome networks induced by the gene products of four functionally
related yet biologically distinct, families of DNA tumour viruses: Human Papillomavirus
(HPV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Adenovirus (Ad5) and Polyomavirus (PyV) (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Applying a stringent implementation of the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system9, 123 viral open
reading frames (viORFs) were screened against a collection of ~13,000 human ORFs10
resulting in a validated viral-host interaction network of 454 binary interactions involving 53
viral proteins and 307 human proteins (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2). Analysis of our
binary interaction map identified 31 host target proteins that exhibited more binary
interactions with viral proteins than would be expected given their “degree” (number of
interactors) in our current binary map of the human interactome network (HI-2)11 (Fig. 1c
and Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Note 1), suggesting a set of common
mechanisms by which different viral proteins rewire the host interactome network.

Author Manuscript

To examine both interactome and transcriptome network perturbations directly in human
cells, we generated expression constructs fusing each viral ORF to a tandem epitope tag and
introduced each construct into IMR-90 normal human diploid fibroblasts. Co-complex
associations between viral proteins and the host proteome were identified by tandem affinity
purification followed by mass spectrometry (TAP-MS)12. The intersection of two
independent TAP-MS experiments yielded 3,787 reproducibly mapped viral-host cocomplex associations involving 54 viral proteins and the products of 1,079 host proteins
(Supplementary Table 4). Statistically significant overlaps of the Y2H binary and the TAPMS co-complex datasets with a positive reference set (PRS) of curated viral-host
interactions were observed, supporting the quality of the interactome datasets
(Supplementary Notes 2 and 3). Host proteins identified as binary interactors or as cocomplex members showed a statistically significant overlap (P < 0.001) and a statistically
significant tendency to interact with each other in HI-2 (P < 0.001), implying that host
targets in the virus-host interactome maps tend to fall in the same “neighbourhood” of the
host network1 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our two complementary interactome datasets
highlight specific host biological processes targeted by viral proteins (Supplementary Fig.
3).

To explore the specificity of viral-host relationships, we examined co-complex associations
mediated by E6 proteins from six distinct HPV types representing three different disease
classes, high-risk or low-risk mucosal, and cutaneous. Multiple host proteins were found to
associate with E6 proteins encoded by two or more different HPV types (P < 0.001; Fig. 1d),
including the known E6 target UBE3A (E6AP)13. Among these we observed a statistically
significant subgroup of host proteins targeted only by E6 proteins from the same disease
class (P < 0.001). The transcriptional regulators CREBBP and EP300 were found to
associate with E6 proteins from both cutaneous HPV types, but not with those from the
mucosal classes. In contrast to E6 proteins, no group of host proteins showed class-specific
targeting by HPV E7 proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4). These differential associations reflect
how rewiring of virus-host interactome networks may relate to the aetiology of viral
diseases.

In addition to targeting protein-protein interactions, viral proteins also functionally perturb
their hosts through downstream effects on gene expression. We profiled the transcriptome of
the viORF-transduced cell lines to trace pathways through which viral proteins could alter
cellular states. Model-based clustering of the ~3,000 most frequently perturbed host genes
identified 31 clusters, many of which were enriched (P < 0.01) for specific GO terms and
KEGG pathways (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). To uncover transcription factor
(TF) binding motifs enriched within the promoters or enhancers of the corresponding genes,
a high-confidence map of predicted TF binding sites was generated using cell-specific
chromatin accessibility information and consensus TF-binding motifs (Supplementary Fig.
5). We found a densely interconnected set of 92 TFs (Supplementary Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Note 4) that either associated with or were differentially expressed in
response to viral proteins, and whose target genes were enriched in at least one cluster
(Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 7).
The mean expression change of each cluster revealed three distinct groups of viral proteins
(Fig. 2a): Group I included low-risk and cutaneous HPV E6 proteins, Group II contained
most of the EBV proteins, and Group III included high-risk HPV E6 and E7 proteins and
polyomavirus proteins. Consistent with their ability to associate with RB1, Group III viral
proteins increased expression of genes that are involved in cell proliferation and whose
promoters are enriched in E2F binding sites (clusters C26 and C31). Steady-state levels of
these genes correlate with cellular growth phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 8 and
Supplementary Note 5). Likewise the down-regulation of the p53 signalling pathway likely
reflects the ability of Group III proteins to bind to and inactivate p53 (cluster C12).

Author Manuscript

To investigate additional pathways through which viral proteins perturb TFs to reprogram
cellular states we derived a detailed network model containing 58 viral proteins that perturb
the activity of 86 TFs, which in turn potentially regulate 30 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 9).
This model was predictive of downstream patterns of differential expression (P = 0.003; Fig.
2b) and suggested ways in which viral proteins could regulate many of the biological
hallmarks of cancer14 (Supplementary Note 6). For example, we found regulation of several
pathways involved in the response to DNA damage (Fig. 2b), including autophagy
potentially through NFE2L2 (cluster C3)15, the NFκB-mediated inflammatory response

Supplementary Fig. 5)17.

Specific disease outcomes of the three disease classes of HPV might reflect how their
respective oncoproteins perturb distinct functional groups of host proteins. Our co-complex
map revealed associations between E6 from cutaneous HPVs and MAML1, EP300 and
CREBBP. MAML1 forms a transcriptional activation complex that modulates expression of
Notch target genes in conjunction with EP300 and CREBBP histone acetyltransferases, the
RBPJ transcription factor and the intracellular domain (ICD) of the Notch receptor18. Our
transcriptome profiling placed the cutaneous and low-risk HPV E6 proteins in Group I apart
from the high-risk HPV E6 proteins in Group III (Fig. 2a), so we investigated these
differential perturbations. Both cutaneous HPV5 and HPV8 E6 proteins co-precipitated
MAML1 and EP300, while the mucosal HPV E6 proteins did not (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Fig. 10); conversely HPV6b, HPV11, HPV16 and HPV18 E6 proteins
associated with UBE3A13, while cutaneous HPV E6 proteins did not.

Author Manuscript

Notch signalling perturbations can confer either oncogenic or tumour-suppressive effects18.
Since both Notch pathway inhibition and HPV8 E6 overexpression promote squamous cell
carcinoma19,20, we reasoned that binding of HPV5 and HPV8 E6 to MAML1 might inhibit
Notch signalling. To test this, we examined transcript levels of Notch pathway genes and
potential Notch target genes with a predicted RBPJ binding site in their promoter across all
HPV E6 cell lines as well as in cells depleted for MAML1. Transcript levels of several
Notch targets were significantly reduced in IMR-90 cells expressing either HPV5 or HPV8
E6 or depleted for MAML1 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 11), These and other results21
indicate that association of HPV5 and HPV8 E6 proteins with MAML1 inhibit Notch
signalling. Building on these observations and on the established associations between EBV
EBNA proteins and RBPJ22, we observed that viral proteins from all four DNA tumour
viruses target proteins of the Notch pathway (P < 0.002; Fig. 3c). Our data highlights the
central role of Notch signalling in viral-host perturbations as well as tumourigenesis, and
supports observations that implicate MAML1 in cancer pathogenesis23.

We next investigated the extent to which viral proteins globally target host proteins altered
in cancer. First we compared our viral targets, identified through binary interaction, cocomplex associations and TF binding site analyses, against a gold standard set of 107 highconfidence causal human cancer genes in the COSMIC Classic (CC) gene set24
(Supplementary Table 8). Viral targets were significantly enriched among CC genes
(Supplementary Fig. 12; Padj = 0.01). To optimize the stringency of potential cancer
enrichment analyses, we restricted the TAP-MS co-complex viral targets to those identified
by three or more unique peptides, a choice corresponding to an experimental reproducibility
rate greater than 90% (Supplementary Fig. 13). The resulting stringent candidate set of 947
host target genes (the “VirHost” set; Supplementary Table 9), included 16 proteins encoded
by CC genes (P = 0.007; Fig. 4a) among which tumour suppressor genes were significantly
over-represented (P = 0.03).
As a complementary approach to validate our VirHost gene set, we compiled a list of human
orthologues of novel mouse genes implicated in tumourigenesis by in vivo transposon

mutagenesis screens25. Our VirHost dataset significantly overlaps with these candidate
cancer genes (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 10). The 156 candidate genes
in the overlap were markedly enriched for CC genes (OR = 13, P = 4 × 10−9) as well as
genes implicated in apoptosis, hypoxia response and cell growth pathways (Padj < 0.05 for
all). Altogether these observations suggest that our VirHost dataset might point to novel
human cancer-associated genes.

Author Manuscript

Large-scale tumour sequencing efforts have the potential to discover new tumour
suppressors and oncogenes. To explore how the VirHost set might be used to interpret these
data, we compiled somatic mutations for eight different cancers identified through twelve
sequencing projects. Non-synonymous somatic mutations were reported for too many genes
(10,543) to permit a useful identification of putative causal cancer genes without further
prioritisation. We therefore scored the likely functional effects of these mutations using the
PolyPhen2 program26 and generated a cumulative somatic mutation (SM) score for each
protein (Supplementary Fig. 14). To compare performance in identifying candidate cancer
genes of our VirHost set with that of proteins ranked by SM analysis, we tested a matching
number (947) of the top ranked SM candidates for overlap with CC genes (Fig. 4c and
Supplementary Table 11). Compared to the 16 cancer genes identified in our VirHost set,
SM recovered 23 genes (P = 6 × 10−10). Viral perturbation analysis is comparable to
somatic mutation sequencing for identifying cancer genes.

Author Manuscript

Although both strategies showed significant overlap with the reference COSMIC Classic set,
neither by itself suffices to pinpoint causal genes with high specificity. To overcome this
difficulty we exploited the orthogonal nature of the VirHost and SM sets (given P = 0.58 for
their overlap) by focusing on the 43 proteins at their intersection (the “VirHostSM” subset)
(Fig. 4c). Compared to VirHost (OR = 3.7) or SM (OR = 5.8), the VirHostSM set was
markedly enriched in CC proteins (5 proteins, OR = 26, P = 3 × 10−6). Pathway analysis of
the 43 proteins revealed 12 proteins implicated in the GO pathway linked to “regulation of
apoptosis” (OR = 6.0, Padj = 0.017). The intersection also includes plausible contributors to
cancer pathogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 15) such as the oxidative stress response
transcription factor NFE2L2.

Author Manuscript

We compared the ability of VirHost to identify CC genes to two other large scale genomic
approaches: SCNA (somatic copy number alteration)27 analysis of cancers and GWAS
(genome-wide association studies) of cancer susceptibility28. The SCNA deletions (SCNADEL) and amplifications (SCNA-AMP) and GWAS sets all significantly overlapped with
CC genes, but with lower specificity than the VirHost overlap with CC (OR = 1.9 for
SCNA-DEL, 2.1 for SCNA-AMP, and 3.1 for GWAS, versus 3.7 for VirHost) (Fig. 4d-f).
The intersections of VirHost with GWAS or SCNA-DEL genes also showed enrichment for
cancer genes (Supplementary Table 12). The intersection of VirHost and SCNA-DEL was
enriched for genes implicated in apoptosis (GO term “programmed cell death”, 15 genes,
Padj = 0.022, OR = 4.3). Conversely, there was no synergy in the intersection of SCNAAMP and VirHost, perhaps reflecting the preference of viral proteins in targeting tumour
suppressors rather than oncogenes (Fig. 4f).

Our systems-level explorations of viral perturbations facilitate the distinction between driver
and passenger mutations in cancer genome sequences. Our data indicate that trans-acting
viral products and cis-acting genome variations involved in cancer converge upon common
pathways.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

viORF entry clones were generated by PCR-based Gateway recombinational cloning4. After
sequence verification viORFs were transferred by in vitro Gateway LR recombinational
cloning into expression vectors for Y2H screening9 and for transduction of IMR-90 cells.
Y2H screens were carried out against the human ORFeome v5.1 collection of ~13,000 fulllength human ORFs10. Total RNA was isolated from IMR-90 cells expressing viORFs and
gene expression was assayed on Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Microarray data was analysed
using R/Bioconductor. Viral proteins and associated host proteins were purified by
sequential FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) immunoprecipitation and analyzed by LCMS/MS mass spectrometry. Viral-host co-complexes from two independent purifications
were analysed. Pathway enrichment was analysed using FuncAssociate29. Assessment of
statistical significance for overlap between gene sets was carried out using Fisher’s Exact
Test or resampling-based approaches.

Figure 1. Systematic mapping of binary interactions and co-complex associations between viral
and host proteins

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

a, The virome-to-variome network model proposes that genomic variations (point mutations,
amplifications, deletions or translocations) and expression of tumour virus proteins induce
related disease states by similarly influencing properties of cellular networks. b,
Experimental pipeline for identifying viral-host interactions. Selected cloned viORFs were
subjected to yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens, and introduced into cell lines for both tandemaffinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) and microarray analyses.
Numbers of viORFs that were successfully processed at each step are indicated in red. c,
Left panel: network of binary viral-host interactions identified by Y2H. Right panel: subsets
of human target proteins that have significantly more (red dots) or less (black dots) viral
interactors than expected based on their degree in HI-2. d, Network of co-complex
associations of E6 viral proteins from six HPV types (hexagons, coloured according to
disease class) with host proteins (circles). Host proteins that associate with two or more E6
proteins are coloured according to the disease class(es) of the corresponding HPV types.
Circle size is proportional to the number of associations between host and viral proteins in
the E6 networks. Distribution plots of 1,000 randomised networks and experimentally
observed data (green arrows) for the number of host proteins targeted by two or more viral
proteins in the corresponding sub-networks (left histogram), or the ratio of the probability of
a host protein being targeted by viral proteins from the same class to the probability it is
targeted by viral proteins from different classes (right histogram). Insets: representative
random networks from these distributions.

Figure 2. Transcriptome perturbations induced by viral protein expression

Author Manuscript

a, Heatmap of average cluster expression relative to control. Enriched GO terms and KEGG
pathways are listed adjacent to the numbered expression clusters. In cluster C1 eight of the
nine transcripts are snoRNAs (denoted with #). Upper dendrogram is shaded by viORF
grouping. Grey blocks show which viral proteins associate with the indicated host proteins.
b, Schematic shows how the viral protein-TF-target gene network was constructed, with
three representative networks shown. Null distribution of average fraction of TF target genes
differentially expressed in the corresponding cell lines (histogram), along with observed
value (green arrow).

Author Manuscript

a, Schematic describing composition of VirHost (proteins identified by TAP-MS with ≥3
unique peptides, Y2H and TF) and overlap with COSMIC Classic genes. Viral protein
(hexagon) perturbations of cancer proteins (circles) classified as oncogenes or tumour
suppressors. b, Venn diagram of overlaps of VirHost proteins with COSMIC Classic genes
and candidate cancer genes identified through four transposon-based functional genomics
screens. c, Venn diagram of overlaps of VirHost proteins with COSMIC Classic genes and
with a prioritised set of genes found through somatic mutation analysis. P values: Fisher’s
exact test or permutation based. d-f, Venn Diagrams comparing VirHost, GWAS (d),
SCNA-AMP (e) and SCNA-DEL (f) data sets for ability to recover COSMIC Classic genes.
