Abstract
Alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas are childhood tumors that do not respond well to current
chemotherapies. Here, we report that the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) can efﬁciently promote cell
death in alveolar, but not embryonal, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Notably, 2-DG also induced cell differentiation accompanied by downregulation of PAX3/FOXO1a, the chromosome translocation–encoded fusion
protein that is a central oncogenic driver in this disease. Cell death triggered by 2-DG was associated with its
ability to activate Bax and Bak. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 prevented
apoptosis, indicating that cell death proceeds through the mitochondrial pathway. Mechanistic investigations
indicated that Mcl-1 downregulation and Noxa upregulation were critical for 2-DG–induced apoptosis.
In addition, 2-DG promoted eIF2a phosphorylation and inactivation of the mTOR pathway. Mcl-1 loss
and cell death were prevented by downregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–induced protein
ATF4 and by incubating cells in the presence of mannose, which reverted 2-DG–induced ER stress but not ATP
depletion. Thus, energetic stresses created by 2-DG were not the primary cause of cell death. Together, our
ﬁndings suggest that glycolysis inhibitors such as 2-DG may be highly effective in treating alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and that Noxa could offer a prognostic marker to monitor the efﬁcacy of such agents. Cancer Res; 71(21);

Introduction
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue tumor
in children and adolescence, accounting for 4% to 5% of
pediatric tumors. The 2 common histiotypes are a favorable
group comprising embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and an
unfavorable group comprising alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
(1). Standard therapeutic regimens are a combination of
vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide, with other
drugs being tested in clinical trials (2). Although the introduction of chemotherapy has greatly improved survival, overall
survival rate is 70%, which indicates that new chemotherapeutic approaches need to be developed (3).
Tumor metabolism is receiving an ever-increasing attention
as an antitumor target. Several metabolic pathways function
differently in tumor and nontransformed cells (4). In particular,
glycolysis is frequently upregulated in tumor cells and respiration is inhibited. This makes tumor cells particularly sensi-

tive to glycolytic inhibitors such as 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or
3-bromopyruvate (5, 6). Some pieces of evidence suggest that
targeting glycolysis could be a good strategy against rhabdomyosarcoma. These cells display mitochondrial respiratory
defects (7) and an energy-producing metabolic phenotype
compared with a more catabolic metabolism of primary myocytes (8). This could be due to hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway, which is frequently observed in rhabdomyosarcoma (9). Second, p53 is frequently inactivated in rhabdomyosarcoma (10). p53 sustains the production of ATP through
respiration, and its loss promotes glycolysis. Therefore, loss of
p53 has been shown to promote susceptibility of tumor cells to
glucose deprivation (11). In addition, rhabdomyosarcoma can
be detected in patients by the positron emission tomographic
technique, which is based on uptake of a glucose analogue (12).
Sensitivity to antiglycolytics is known to be regulated by a
number of proteins involved in response to metabolic stress.
However, little is known about the cell death proteins that
respond to these drugs (13). Cell death in animals occurs
mainly through apoptosis or necrosis; these forms of cell death
promote different responses in the tissue, with necrosis being a
proinﬂammatory form of cell death, as opposed to apoptosis
(14). About apoptosis, 2 major pathways have been described:
the extrinsic, death ligand–mediated pathway, and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway (15). The ﬁrst pathway is initiated by death ligands such as TNF, Fas ligand, or TRAIL and is
mediated by the protease caspase-8. The mitochondrial pathway is initiated by "BH3-only" proteins such as Bim, Noxa, or
Puma, which act as stress sensors and promote activation of

Bax and Bak on the mitochondrial membrane. This allows the
release of cytochrome c, which promotes formation of the
apoptosome and caspase activation.
We aimed to determine whether rhabdomyosarcoma cells
are sensitive to the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG. We describe that
alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells are sensitive to this drug.
Moreover, we provide evidence that the BH3 protein Noxa
mediates apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines [Rh4, Rh30 (obtained
from the original repository, Peter Houghton's laboratory in
2008), and Rh41 purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen 2008] and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD from European HPACC 2009 and
A-204 from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen 2008) were expanded and frozen within 2 weeks of
purchase and used for a maximum of 2 months after resuscitation of frozen aliquots. They were authenticated by the
provider on the basis of viability, recovery, growth, morphology, as well as by cytogenetic analysis, antigen expression, DNA
proﬁle, and isoenzymology. Cells were maintained in highglucose (25 mmol/L), pyruvate-free Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 200 mg/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 10% FBS (Invitrogen).
For treatments, cells were plated at a concentration of
200,000/mL and treated in fresh medium 24 hours later at
70% conﬂuence (600,000/mL). Q-VD-OPH (SM Biochemicals
LLC) was used at 20 mmol/L and added simultaneously with
2-DG. An equal amount of DMSO was added to the controls.
Western blotting
Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, lysed by resuspending them in lysis buffer [5 mmol/L Tris-HCl/2% SDS, Complete
Antiprotease Cocktail (Roche)], and frozen. For analysis of
phosphoproteins and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a), cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
plus orthovanadate and 2-glycerol-phosphate. After sonication, protein concentration was measured with BCA Protein
Assay Reagent (bicinchoninic acid; Pierce). Equal amounts of
protein were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer. After electrophoresis, protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane (Millipore). Membrane was blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline–Tween (0.1%).
Antibodies are detailed in Supplementary Methods.
Immunocytochemistry
Attached and detached cells were collected by trypsinization, ﬁxed in suspension with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for
20 minutes at room temperature, washed, and blocked with
0.1% bovine serum albumin þ 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1
hour. They were then incubated overnight with anti-active Bax
(6A7, catalog no. 556467; BD Pharmingen; 1:100) or anti-active
Bak (Ab-1/TC100; Calbiochem/Merck) diluted in blocking
buffer. See more details in Supplementary Methods.

Immunoprecipitations
Attached cells were collected by trypsinization and washed
in PBS together with detached cells. They were lysed in 500 mL
of CHAPS immunoprecipitation buffer [2% CHAPS, 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 10%
glycerol] plus Complete Protein Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets
(Roche) for 30 minutes. Thirty microliters of Protein G Magnetic Beads (Millipore) was washed 3 in immunoprecipitation buffer without CHAPS and then incubated in 1 mL CHAPS
buffer with 2 mg of antibody for 4 hours at 4 C under rotation.
Five hundred micrograms of total cell extract was incubated
overnight in 1 mL of beads coupled with 2 mg of antibody. The
next day, beads were washed 3 times with immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated with 45 mL of immunoprecipitation
buffer containing 2% SDS and 15 mL of SDS loading buffer
(containing 5% b-mercaptoethanol) for 10 minutes at 95 C.
Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Measurement of cell death
For sub-G1 analysis, detached and attached cells were
trypsinized, washed in PBS, ﬁxed in 70% cold ethanol while
vortexing, and incubated for 1 to 10 days at 20 C. For
experiments of transient transfection, ﬁxation was done in
4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS at room temperature
for 15 minutes before washing. Cells were further washed,
resuspended in PBS with 40 mg/mL PI and 100 mg/mL RNAse A,
and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C before ﬂuorescenceactivated cell-sorting analysis.
DNA and RNA transfections, plasmids, and generation of
cell lines
For DNA transfection, cells were incubated in 10-cm dishes
in antibiotic-free DMEM and incubated for 6 hours with 25 mL
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 10 mg of DNA. For generation of Rh4 cells stably expressing Bcl-xL, they were transfected as described earlier and selected with 0.5 mg/mL puromycin. pBABE-Bcl-xL was provided by Dr. J. Goldstein, and the
pcDNA plasmids encoding Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were provided by
Dr. J-E. Ricci (INSERM, Nice) and Prof. Seamus Martin (TCD,
Ireland), respectively. For transfections of siRNA, cells were
incubated in antibiotic-free DMEM for 8 hours (6 hours for
Mcl-1) with siRNA 100 nmol/L premixed with DharmaFECT 1
(Dharmacon). Sequences are detailed in Supplementary
Methods.
Reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA (3 mg), extracted with the Nucleospin RNA II Kit
(MACHEREY-NAGEL), was used for cDNA synthesis with
SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Ampliﬁcations were carried out with speciﬁc primers (Noxa: forward 50 CTCGACAAAAGCGTGGTCTC, reverse 50 -CAACTGGAGCACCTCGGAC; Mcl-1: forward 50 -GAGGAGGACGAGTTGTACCGG, reverse 50 -CAGACCTGCCCATTGGCTT; b-actin: forward
50 -CGGGACCTGACTGACTACCTC, reverse 50 -CTTCATTGTGCTGGGTGC). For each set of primers, the number of cycles
was adjusted so that the reaction endpoints fell within the
exponential phase of product ampliﬁcation, thus providing a
semiquantitative estimate of relative mRNA abundance.

Results

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma generally have a better
prognosis than alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. We observed that
RD and A-204 embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells were much
more resistant than alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma to 2-DG. Only
RD cells showed cell death at high doses, almost equimolar
with glucose concentration in the medium (Fig. 1D). A-204 cells
were completely resistant at all doses tested (Fig. 1E). We did,
however, observe inhibition of cell growth at higher doses (Fig.
1F). To determine whether this cell growth arrest was irreversible, after 72 hours, cells were washed and were left to grow
in the absence of 2-DG. Cell growth arrest was reversible
because cells started to grow back immediately after removal
of the drug (Fig. 1F). Because HIF-1a frequently regulates
tumor glycolytic phenotype, one possibility was that HIF-1a
was differentially expressed in embryonal versus alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma and it could be regulating uptake and
toxicity of 2-DG in rhabdomyosarcomas. Thus, we analyzed the
levels of this protein in the 5 cell lines. HIF-1a was virtually

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines are sensitive to
2-DG
2-DG induces different effects in different tumor cell lines: It
reduces proliferation, induces cell-cycle arrest, or promotes
apoptosis (16). We analyzed the effects of 2-DG in a panel of
alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. 2-DG inhibited the
growth of Rh4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells incubated
with doses of 2 mmol/L or higher, even though glucose is
present at 25 mmol/L in the culture medium (Supplementary
Fig. S1). We observed cell death at doses over 5 mmol/L
(Fig. 1A). Cell death was likely due to apoptosis because DNA
was degraded and cells displayed sub-G1 DNA content. Furthermore, DNA cleavage was prevented by incubating cells in
the presence of the caspase inhibitor Q-VD. The same results
were observed in Rh30 or Rh41 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
cell lines (Fig. 1B and C).

undetectable in all untreated cells. Upon treatment, the levels
of this protein did not increase, and its downregulation using
siRNA did not provide protection from 2-DG. Rather, a slight
sensitization was observed (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Although alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells express markers
of muscular differentiation, they lack the possibility of terminal
differentiation, what is believed to be caused by PAX/FOXO1a
chimeras (17, 18). Because differentiated cells stop proliferating, one of the aims of the therapy is to promote differentiation
of the tumor cells. We observed fusion of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells characteristic of myotube formation and terminal differentiation after treatment with 2-DG (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1). This was likely due to the fact that
2-DG induced the downregulation of the fusion protein PAX3/
FOXO1a (Fig. 2B), which promotes differentiation of these cells
(17). This effect was more pronounced when cells were cultured in differentiation medium (without serum) and was not
inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Q-VD, indicating that differentiation was not a consequence of caspase activity.

Apoptosis induced by 2-DG proceeds through the
mitochondrial pathway
In hematopoietic cells, apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation proceeds through the mitochondrial pathway (13).
However, we have described that in other cell types, apoptosis
induced by lack of glucose is mediated by caspase-8 and it does
not require a functional mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (19).
We observed that the most sensitive cell lines did not express
detectable caspase-8 (Supplementary Fig. S3). We thus analyzed the mitochondrial pathway by immunostaining with
antibodies that detect the active forms of Bax and Bak, the
proteins that mediate mitochondrial permeabilization during
apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3C, 2-DG promoted Bax and Bak
activation even when cells were treated in the presence of
Q-VD, indicating that these events are not a consequence of
caspase activity.
To further show the involvement of the mitochondrial
pathway in death by 2-DG, we overexpressed the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 homologues Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 in Rh4 cells (Fig. 4A and B
and Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Both proteins prevented
death induced by 2-DG. Conversely, downregulation of these
proteins sensitized cells to 2-DG (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S5).
Inhibition of glucose metabolism by limitation of glucose
(20) or by 2-DG (21) promotes downregulation of the

2-DG induces apoptotic cell death
Inhibition of glucose metabolism induces cell death by
necrosis or by apoptosis, probably depending on the cell type
(13). Results shown in Fig. 1 suggest apoptosis as the form of
cell death, because death is inhibited by the caspase inhibitor
Q-VD. However, we were unable to detect cleavage of caspase-3
by Western blotting (not shown). To verify that cell death is due
to apoptosis, we analyzed cleavage of the caspase substrate
PARP. Treatment with 2-DG promoted PARP cleavage, which
was inhibited by Q-VD (Fig. 3A). Moreover, 2-DG induced

antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1. In Rh4 cells, we
observed downregulation of Mcl-1, which could not be prevented by inhibition of caspases (Fig. 4E). Levels of other
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL)
increased during treatment, whereas Bax and Bak did not
change signiﬁcantly. We analyzed the levels of putative
BH3-only proteins that could be responsible for cell death
induced by 2-DG (Fig. 5A). We observed that Puma was not
induced by the treatment. However, Bim and Noxa showed
moderate increases, which prompted us to analyze their role by
employing siRNA (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5). As
shown in Fig. 5C, siRNA-mediated ablation of Noxa, but not
Bim, conferred signiﬁcant resistance to 2-DG. The combined
ablation of the 2 proteins did not confer further resistance to
cell death, indicating that Noxa is the major cell death
mediator.
Noxa is constitutively bound to Mcl-1 in many cell lines, and
it has also been described to be bound to Bcl-xL (22). These
antiapoptotic proteins can also sequester Bak and Bax. Proapoptotic proteins such as Noxa can free Bax/Bak, allowing

them to promote cytochrome c release. We studied interactions between these proteins and observed that Mcl-1 is
constitutively bound to Bim and Noxa (Fig. 5D and E). In
addition, we could detect very weak interactions between Bak
and Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. S6). Bcl-2
and Bax could not be coimmunoprecipitated with Bak or BclxL/Mcl-1, respectively (data not shown). We could not observe
changes in the binding pattern of these proteins when treated
with 2-DG.
The Noxa/Mcl-1 axis has been described to be involved in
cell death induced by inhibition of cell metabolism, and its
levels and activity have been shown to be regulated by multiple
transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (21, 23–
25). We checked for transcriptional regulation and observed
that mRNA levels of these proteins barely changed (Fig. 6A). By
blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide, we observed
that stability of the short-lived Mcl-1 and Noxa was dramatically enhanced when cells were treated with 2-DG (Fig. 6B).
Because Mcl-1 is very sensitive to inhibition of translation, we
analyzed the status of 2 pathways that lead to translation

inhibition and Mcl-1 downregulation: Ser51 phosphorylation of
the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-a (eIF2a) and mTOR inactivation (21, 26). We observed both phosphorylation of eIF2a
and inactivation (dephosphorylation) of the marker of mTOR
status S6 (Fig. 6C). In addition, we observed that Noxa contributed modestly to downregulation of Mcl-1 (Fig. 6D).
Endoplasmic reticulum stress, but not ATP loss,
correlates with apoptosis and regulation of Noxa and
Mcl-1
Glucose deprivation and 2-DG impair generation of ATP,
synthesis of macromolecules, and protein modiﬁcations such
as acetylation and glycosylation. Although 2-DG is frequently
used as a caloric restriction mimic, it has been shown to kill
some tumor cell lines by interference with protein N-glycosylation rather than by causing energetic stress (27). We aimed to
identify the major cause of death induced by 2-DG by incubating cells in the presence of the sugar mannose, which
rescues some cell lines from the toxicity of 2-DG by restoring
glycosylation. We observed that coincubation with mannose
completely prevented cell death induced by 2-DG (Fig. 7A).

www.aacrjournals.org

This suggested that death was due to impairment of glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the subsequent
ER stress. We indeed observed induction of several ER stress
markers such as ATF4/CREB2 and GRP58 and the ER chaperones GRP94/endoplasmin and GRP78/BiP (Fig. 7B). Mannose
fully prevented the induction of these proteins. Moreover,
mannose prevented accumulation of Noxa and loss of Mcl1, and it reduced the induction of Bim (Fig. 7B). To verify that
mannose was not interfering with all effects of 2-DG, for
instance, by reducing its uptake or providing metabolites for
mitochondrial oxidation, we measured the effects of mannose
on ATP depletion. As shown in Fig. 7C, 2-DG promoted a
reduction of ATP levels that was not prevented by the addition
of mannose. These results suggest that the Noxa/Mcl-1 axis is
involved in ER stress–induced apoptosis. To further analyze
this, we treated the cells with the ER stressor tunicamycin at a
dose that promoted cell death with the same kinetics as 2-DG
(Fig. 7D). We observed that tunicamycin also promoted a late
increase in Noxa levels and a rapid decrease in Mcl-1. Moreover, we downregulated the transcription factor ATF4, which
is induced by the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase

Discussion
Rhabdomyosarcomas are aggressive tumors for which more
effective chemotherapy needs to be found. We provide evidence here that an inhibitor of the glycolytic metabolism is
effective against alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This subgroup
of rhabdomyosarcoma is characterized by a chromosomal
translocation involving PAX3 or PAX7 and the FKHR (Foxo1)
genes. PAX-FKHR fusion gene has been shown to alter the
expression of some metabolic enzymes (28), which may
account for the different sensitivity of these tumor cell lines
when compared with the embryonal subtype. Other possible
determinants of the sensitivity to 2-DG are p53 and HIF-1,
which regulate the glycolytic phenotype. p53 is not functional
in any of the 3 sensitive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines
tested (29, 30), which would agree with data that indicate that
p53 protects cells from metabolic stress. However, RD cells are
also deﬁcient in p53 but still insensitive. According to our
results, HIF-1a does not seem to be mediating the differential
response to 2-DG either (Supplementary Fig. S2). We did
however observe a small but reproducible sensitization to

2-DG when HIF-1a was downregulated, in accordance with
the studies of Maher and colleagues, which indicate that HIF-1
protects cells under hypoxia from 2-DG (31).
In this work, we have used the most commonly used
glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG that has been tested in clinical trials
and has been proven to be well tolerated by patients (32). Other
drugs that target glycolysis are being tested in preclinical
models and may prove more effective in the future (4). Furthermore, it is possible that this drug would be more effective
in combination regimens, because 2-DG synergizes with chemo- and radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo.
Cell death by glucose deprivation has been studied in several
models, and the ﬁndings indicate that different cell lines die in
different manners when subjected to low glucose availability.
In general, glucose deprivation kills hematopoietic cells by
mitochondrial apoptosis, whereas mesenchymal or epithelial
cells die by necrosis or by caspase-8–dependent apoptosis
(19, 33). We observed that Rh4 and Rh30 cells died by necrosis
when incubated in the absence of glucose (not shown) but by
apoptosis when cultured with 2-DG, indicating that 2-DG and
acute glucose deprivation do not promote death in the same
manner. 2-DG is widely used to mimic glucose starvation.
However, recent studies indicate that toxicity of 2-DG may be
due to effects that are different from those in the absence of
glucose. 2-DG inhibits glycolysis and usage of glucose to

produce ATP or fatty acids. However, 2-DG can be metabolized
through the pentose phosphate pathway in some conditions
(34), and a catalytic block does not sufﬁciently explain the
toxicity of 2-DG (35). Moreover, 2-DG alters protein glycosylation in a manner that is different from that of glucose
deprivation: While it inhibits N-glycosylation, it enhances
O-GlcNAcylation. 2-DG has been shown to kill some cells in
normoxia by inhibition of N-glycosylation, and the subsequent
ER stress, rather than by inhibition of glycolysis (27). Our
experiments indicate that ER stress mediates rhabdomyosarcoma cell death, because a sugar that reverts the effects of 2-DG
on N-glycosylation, mannose (36), completely protected from
cell death, and inhibition of the ATF4 ER stress pathway
partially prevented apoptosis. Inhibition of glycolysis does not
seem to be critical for the toxicity of 2-DG over rhabdomyosarcoma. The fact that mannose did not prevent ATP loss
induced by 2-DG rules out the possibility that mannose prevents death because it is being metabolized and used as a
glycolytic intermediate. Indeed, Kurtoglu and colleagues
showed that mannose cannot revert 2-DG toxicity in anaerobic
conditions, in which cells are more dependent on glucose, and
toxicity of 2-DG would be primarily due to inhibition of
anaerobic glycolysis (27).

www.aacrjournals.org

The apoptotic mechanism by which 2-DG induces cell death
has remained underexplored, even though this compound has
been used in clinical trials. Apoptosis induced by glucose
deprivation in hematopoietic cells is inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, and it has been shown to be mediated by
Noxa, Puma, or Bim (20, 25). We could not detect induction of
Puma, possibly because this protein is usually induced in a p53dependent manner, but the alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells
used in this study are deﬁcient in p53 (29, 30). Consistent with
data that suggest that death induced by 2-DG is due to ER
stress, we observed induction of Bim, which mediates death
induced by ER stress in some systems (37). However, when Bim
accumulation was prevented by RNA interference, no effect on
cell death induced by 2-DG was observed (Fig. 6). Moreover,
Bim induction was only partially prevented by mannose,
although this sugar completely prevented cell death.
We observed that Noxa was critical for cell death. Noxa is a
well-studied BH3-only protein that has recently been described
to play a role in glucose metabolism by promoting glucose
uptake but directing glucose ﬂux away from the glycolytic
pathway by a yet uncharacterized mechanism (23). Noxa/
PMAIP1 mRNA had been observed to be induced in response
to 2-DG (38), but its role in cell death had not been tested. In

addition, Noxa has been shown to mediate death by ER
stressors (22). In our studies, both Noxa induction and loss
of Mcl-1 seem to be a consequence of ER stress rather than of
energetic stress because the addition of mannose prevented
both events (Fig. 7B). Regulation of both proteins was posttranscriptional. In the case of Noxa, its induction is observed
only at long time points (3 days), whereas we can detect 40%
death at 48 hours. This suggests that Noxa induction and
stabilization are not as critical as its activation, which could
possibly occur via phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase
5 (CDK5; ref. 23). Mcl-1 is likely to be downregulated because of
inhibition of translation. eIF2a phosphorylation had been
shown to regulate Mcl-1 levels (26). In this line, we show that
the ER stressor tunicamycin, which, like 2-DG, induces ER
stress by inhibiting N-glycosylation, also promoted loss of Mcl1 and induction of Noxa. Downregulation of ATF4 partially
prevented Mcl-1 downregulation in response to 2-DG, but
more experiments are required to determine how ATF4 contributes to maintain its levels. Besides ER stress, a contribution
of the mTOR pathway to downregulation of Mcl-1 is also likely:
It has been described that glucose deprivation activates

6804

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

AMP-activated protein kinase and inactivates mTOR, which
leads to a decrease in Mcl-1 levels. In response to 2-DG, Mcl-1
decrease was also associated with inactivation of translation
(21, 39).
To our knowledge, this article shows the ﬁrst evidence of the
implication of a BH3-only protein in death induced by 2-DG.
Another glycolytic inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate, promotes
dephosphorylation of the BH3-only protein Bad (6), which has
also been involved in cell death induced by glucose deprivation
in hepatocytes (40). Our results indicate that Noxa is critical for
sensitivity to cell death induced by 2-DG. A likely scenario
would be that downregulation of Mcl-1 and its inactivation by
Noxa would release Bak, which could then be activated. Our
immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that Mcl-1 blocks
apoptosis, in part, by sequestering Noxa and Bak. In addition,
Bcl-xL prevented cell death when overexpressed, and we could
detect (weakly) interaction of Bak with Bcl-xL. However, we
were unable to detect release of Bak from Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL upon
treatment with 2-DG. It is possible that only a very minor
fraction is released, and the use of other antibodies would
perhaps improve detection of interactions. In addition, other

BH3-only proteins may also participate in the induction of
apoptosis. Altogether, our results suggest that expression of
Noxa could predict sensitivity to antiglycolytic drugs, that
inhibition of glycolysis could be an effective novel strategy to
treat alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and that antiglycolytic
drugs should be further tested in clinical trials against this
type of tumors.
