BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma (PDEC) usually have a short survival. The chemotherapy combination of cisplatin and etoposide is frequently used as first-line palliative chemotherapy. There are, however, no published studies concerning second-line treatment of the disease. Temozolomide has
shown clinical effect in well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of
temozolomide in PDEC patients who had progressed on first-line treatment. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with
PDEC (mainly gastrointestinal) were treated with temozolomide alone or in combination with capecitabine. A subset
of patient also received bevacizumab. MGMT methylation was analyzed in tissue specimens. Data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: One patient had a complete response, and 7 patients had partial response (33% response
rate). Median duration of response was 19 months. Another 9 (38%) patients had a stable disease, after progression
at inclusion, with a median duration of 18 months. Median progression-free survival for all patients was 6 months, and
median overall survival was 22 months. Only 1 patient had a MGMT methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with
temozolomide alone or in combination with capecitabine and bevacizumab resulted in objective response or stabilization in 71% of PDEC patients who failed on first-line chemotherapy. These results indicated that temozolomide may

Poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma (PDEC) can arise in many different organs, but the most common are the
gastrointestinal tract, cervix uteri, and bronchopulmonary area. Gastrointestinal primary carcinomas account for 35%55% of all extra pulmonary PDEC.1,2 In the 2000 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, endocrine tumors
are classified as well-differentiated endocrine tumors, well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas, and poorly differentiated
endocrine carcinomas.3 PDEC have a higher proliferation rate than well-differentiated endocrine tumors, and by definition, according to WHO classification, the proliferation rate should be at least 20% but is often as high as 90%.4 Scarce
data exist on the clinical behavior and treatment outcome for this tumor group as previously they often were analyzed together with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors or misdiagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. In the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, gastrointestinal (GI) PDEC has an incidence of 2 to
1,000,000 inhabitants/year,5 but the true number is probably higher.
Most GI PDEC is metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Median survival from diagnosis in untreated patients is usually
4 months to 6 months, indicating a very rapidly growing tumor. PDEC do not respond to treatments, such as somatostatin analogs and interferon, that are usually applied to other neuroendocrine tumors.6,7 First-line treatment for metastatic
PDEC is cisplatin and etoposide, with response rates of 42%-67% with a median duration of response of 8 months to 9
months. Median overall survival has been 6 months to 19 months.8,9,10 The addition of paclitaxel to carboplatin/

etoposide as first-line therapy did not show any advantage
compared with the 2-drug regimen.10 When progression
occurs after first-line chemotherapy, the disease is usually
very aggressive, and patients have a short survival. Different second-line chemotherapy combinations have been
tried, but with poor results, and they have been rarely
reported.
Temozolomide has been used alone or in combination with capecitabine or bevacizumab in well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, resulting in
high response rates.11,12-14 In a previous study, we found
that a patient with PDEC responded to temozolomide
treatment.11 We thereafter started to treat consecutively
all our PDEC patients who had failed on prior chemotherapy with temozolomide alone or in combination with
capecitabine and, in some cases, also bevacizumab. This
study was initiated to evaluate the possible effect of temozolomide in our PDEC patients.
Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT (O6 methyl guanine–DNA methyltransferase) DNA repair gene by promoter methylation compromises DNA repair and is a
predictive factor for benefit of temozolomide treatment in
patients with glioblastoma.15 Therefore, we also investigated the methylation status in patients where tissue was
available.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
During 2004-2009, 25 patients at the department of endocrine oncology in Uppsala, Sweden, and the department of oncology in Bergen, Norway, were consecutively
included in this study. The treatment was evaluated in retrospect. All patients receiving this treatment were
included into the study. The diagnosis was either a histological verified diagnosis of a PDEC according to the second WHO classification system or an atypical bronchial
carcinoid with a ki-67 above 20%. Small cell lung carcinoma and large cell lung carcinoma were excluded.
Patients with an unknown primary had to have a normal
chest computed tomography (CT) scan and a dominance
of GI metastases. All patients had a performance status of
0-2. Renal function was normal in 22 patients. Three
patients had increased creatinine, and 2 of these had a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of <35. Hepatic function
was normal in all patients. The ethics committees in both
countries approved the study. All patients had to have
received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and to
have had radiologically documented progression by

criteria at their inclusion in the study.
Treatment and Evaluation
Patients were treated with temozolomide 150 mg/m2 (n
¼ 2) to 200 mg/m2 (n ¼ 3) for 5 days every fourth week,
or in combination with capecitabine 1000 mg twice a day
(n ¼ 8), or 750 mg twice a day (n ¼ 11) on days 1-14,
and temozolomide 150 mg/m2 days 10-14, and, in a subset of patients (n ¼ 7), bevacizumab was added to the
combination at 5 mg/kg on days 14 and 28 in 28-day
cycles. Side effects were collected from the medical files.
Any National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) grade
3-4 toxicity was registered. Radiological evaluation was
performed at baseline and every second month with a contrast-enhanced CT. Response evaluation was performed
according to RECIST 1.0 criteria.
Statistics
Survival was calculated from start of the temozolomide
combination treatment. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses
were performed for overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) with Graph PAD Prism program
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif).
MGMT Promoter Methylation Analysis
MGMT promoter methylation status was analyzed by
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in
the 20 patients who had available tissue blocks. Formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples were deparaffinized by successive incubations in xylene, 100% ethanol,
80% ethanol, 60% ethanol, and 40% ethanol. DNA isolation was performed using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA from
patients was modified by bisulfite conversion, using the
EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo, Irvine, Calif).
Primers were designed to specifically amplify methylated
and unmethylated DNA (for methylated, 500 TTTCGACGTTCTAGGTTTTCGC-30
and
500 0
GCACTCTTCCGAAAACGAAACG-3 ; for unmethylated, 500 -TTTGTGTTTTGA TGTTTGTAGGTTTT
TGT-30 and 500 -AACTCCACACTCTTCCAAAAACAAAACA-30 ). Methylation- and unmethylation-specific PCRs (MSP and USP) were performed using the
AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase system (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif) in a 50 lL
solution containing 1 PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.5 mM each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.2 lM of
each primer, and 50 ng of modified genomic DNA.

The thermocycling conditions for both the MSP and the
USP were an initial 5 minutes of denaturation at 95 C
followed by 35 cycles of 60 seconds at 94 C, 45 seconds
at 59 C, and 60 seconds at 72 C. Included in each run
were a methylated control (CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA; Millipore, Billerica, Mass), an unmethylated
control (modified DNA from healthy donors), and a negative control (water). After amplification, the PCR products were separated and observed on a 3% agarose gel.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Twenty-four patients received cisplatin/etoposide as firstline treatment, and 1 patient received docetaxel (Taxotere) and doxorubicin as 1-line therapy due to impaired
renal function. Seven patients received docetaxel/doxorubicin as 2-line chemotherapy and were given temozolomide therapy as third-line therapy. Seventeen patients
died during follow-up. Eight were still alive, and 5 were
still receiving treatment at data cutoff in May 2010.
Response
The overall response rate was 33%. One (4%) patient
achieved a complete response (CR) and was still free of
disease 48 months after start of second-line treatment
(Fig. 1). Seven (29%) patients had a partial response (PR)
with a median time of duration of 19 months (95% CI, 9
months to 48 months). Nine (38%) patients had stable
disease (SD) with a median duration time of 18 months
(95% CI, 7.0 months-infinity). Of these 9, 3 were still stable and continuing treatment after 13, 18, and 18
months, respectively. One patient died after 2 months
due to a myocardial infarction not suspected to be related
to the disease or medication. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients was 6 months (95% CI, 4
months to 14 months). Median OS was 22 months (95%
CI, 8 months to 27 months). Table 2 shows survival
according to response.
Patients with a Ki-67 of <60%, positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CgA, positive somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), and lack of response to firstline therapy seemed to respond more often to temozolomide-based chemotherapy. Adding capecitabine and bevacizumab to temozolomide did not seem to have any
additional effect. PFS for patients according to their CgA
expression and SRS status are shown in Figure 2.

MGMT results
Tumor DNA for MGMT promoter methylation analysis
was available in 20 patients. Out of these 20, 17 had
evaluable results. Only 1 of these patients was positive for
MGMT methylation. This patient had a PR for 15
months and an OS of 22 months. IHC for MGMT in
this patient was negative.
Toxicity
One patient developed insulin-dependent diabetes, which
resolved when the patient stopped therapy. One patient
had to stop capecitabine because of increasing liver
enzymes, and 1 because of chest pain suspected to be angina pectoris (a well-known side effect of capecitabine).

Too few events for calculations.

However, both patients continued with temozolomide,
and in 1 case, also bevacizumab. One patient developed
thrombocytopenia and leucopoenia grade 3 and continued therapy with reduced doses of temozolomide. There
were no other grade 3-4 side effects.

DISCUSSION
This study is the first to report results on second-line
chemotherapy treatment in PDEC. Usually these patients
rapidly deteriorate after first-line treatment and have a
short survival.4 In our study, 71% of the patients had at
least stabilization of their disease after an initial progression on first-line therapy. PFS and OS after the start of
temozolomide treatment were 12 months (95% CI, 5.524) and 22 months (95% CI, 12-31) among patients who
experienced a response to therapy or stabilization of their
disease, whereas OS was only 8 months (95% CI, 0-8)
among patients without a response to therapy. Our

4620

patients had a median survival from initial diagnose of 32
months (95% CI, 22-42). In previous studies, survival
from time of diagnosis has been 6 months to 19 months.89,16-18
Our good survival results may be due in part to a
selection of patients with a better prognosis, as patients
with a poor performance status might not have been
referred or able to receive any further chemotherapy treatment. As our study patients had the same percentage of
SRS positivity as a Danish cohort of patients screened initially at diagnosis,19 our patient cohort is probably quite
representative.
The treatment was well-tolerated, without any
severe side effects, and the patients could receive treatment
mainly at home, all of which contributed to a good quality
of life. Temozolomide can be given to patients with deteriorated renal function and may be a first-line option for
patients unable to receive platinum combinations.
Usually in cancer patients, initial response to first-line
chemotherapy is an indicator of whether the patient will

respond to second-line therapy. An unexpected observation
in our study was that patients who had little to no response
to first-line chemotherapy (PD best response) seemed to
respond more often to second-line therapy than patients
who had responded to first-line chemotherapy. A lack of
response to first-line therapy should, therefore, not exclude
these patients from trying this second-line therapy.
Temozolomide alone has been reported to have an
antitumoral effect in neuroendocrine tumors and in combination with capecitabine or bevacizumab.11-14 In a
small study, it was also shown that lack of expression of
MGMT correlated with the response.11,20 Epigenetic
silencing of MGMT has been shown to predict benefit of
temozolomide treatment in brain glioblastoma. It does
not seem to play a major part in PDEC as only 1 of the 17
patients investigated displayed methylation of this gene.
In most neuroendocrine tumor (NET) guidelines, it
is stated that SRS is usually negative in PDEC. In our
study, however, we found a positive SRS in 62% of the
patients. This is in accordance with a recent study, where
69% of PDEC patients were positive on SRS at initial
screening.19 An SRS should, therefore, be performed in
PDEC patients, as it seems to be a prognostic and predic-

tive marker to response of chemotherapy and may indicate
whether peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)
could be a future treatment option.21
In our study, we used temozolomide alone or in
combination with capecitabine. A subset of patients was
also treated with bevacizumab. The difference in treatment was due to the uncommon disease and new data that
were reported during the recruitment period. Adding
capecitabine to temozolomide has been shown to result in
high response rates in NET.14 The importance of adding
capecitabine or bevacizumab to temozolomide is not
known. Our results did not show any benefit to adding
capecitabine or bevacizumab to temozolomide; however,
the number of patients in each group was small. According to the WHO classification, all patients had a Ki-67 >
20%. Although the WHO classification does not separate
between different levels of Ki-67 in PDEC, there are
probably differences between a tumor with a Ki-67 of
20% and 90% regarding tumor biology. We found more
responders in patients with a Ki-67 <60% than those
with a Ki67 >60%. There were also more responders in
the group with a strong uptake on SRS and in those with
positive staining for CgA. Both factors are often associated
with more differentiated tumors. The study is, however,
too small to draw any firm conclusions on predictive factors for response to temozolomide treatment in PDEC.
Our results show for the first time, an active, welltolerated, second-line chemotherapy regimen for PDEC
patients who have progressed after first-line chemotherapy, resulting in high response rates and a promising
survival.
