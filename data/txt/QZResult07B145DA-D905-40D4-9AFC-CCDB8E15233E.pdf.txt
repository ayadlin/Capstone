ABSTRACT
Here, we propose a new strategy for the treatment of early cancerous lesions and
advanced metastatic disease, via the selective targeting of cancer stem cells (CSCs),
a.k.a., tumor-initiating cells (TICs). We searched for a global phenotypic characteristic
that was highly conserved among cancer stem cells, across multiple tumor types,
to provide a mutation-independent approach to cancer therapy. This would allow
us to target cancer stem cells, effectively treating cancer as a single disease
of “stemness”, independently of the tumor tissue type. Using this approach, we
identified a conserved phenotypic weak point – a strict dependence on mitochondrial
biogenesis for the clonal expansion and survival of cancer stem cells. Interestingly,
several classes of FDA-approved antibiotics inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis as a
known “side-effect”, which could be harnessed instead as a “therapeutic effect”.
Based on this analysis, we now show that 4-to-5 different classes of FDA-approved
drugs can be used to eradicate cancer stem cells, in 12 different cancer cell lines,
across 8 different tumor types (breast, DCIS, ovarian, prostate, lung, pancreatic,
melanoma, and glioblastoma (brain)). These five classes of mitochondrially-targeted
antibiotics include: the erythromycins, the tetracyclines, the glycylcyclines, an antiparasitic drug, and chloramphenicol. Functional data are presented for one antibiotic
in each drug class: azithromycin, doxycycline, tigecycline, pyrvinium pamoate, as
well as chloramphenicol, as proof-of-concept. Importantly, many of these drugs are
non-toxic for normal cells, likely reducing the side effects of anti-cancer therapy.
Thus, we now propose to treat cancer like an infectious disease, by repurposing FDAapproved antibiotics for anti-cancer therapy, across multiple tumor types. These drug
classes should also be considered for prevention studies, specifically focused on the
prevention of tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. Finally, recent clinical trials
with doxycycline and azithromycin (intended to target cancer-associated infections,

patients, although their ability to eradicate cancer stem cells was not yet appreciated.

INTRODUCTION

the CSC population.
Here, we show that 4-to-5 different classes of
FDA-approved antibiotics, which inhibit mitochondrial
biogenesis as an “off-target” effect, can be used to
eradicate cancer stem cells, in 12 different cancer cell
lines, across 8 different tumor types (breast, DCIS,
ovarian, prostate, lung, pancreatic, melanoma, and
glioblastoma (brain)). Thus, future clinical trials for testing
the efficacy of these mitochondrially-targeted antibiotics,
in multiple cancer types, are now clearly clinically
warranted. Overall, the use of generic antibiotics for
anti-cancer therapy should significantly reduce the costs
of patient care, making treatment more accessible in the
developing world.

Next generation sequencing and many other very
sophisticated means of mutational analysis have given us
an incredibly detailed view, or “molecular portrait”, of the
diversity of genetic modifications that occur during the
development of human cancers [1-5].
Despite this knowledge of the genomic landscape
of cancer, it still remains extremely difficult to identify
what are the primary “driver-mutations”, in the context of
a “sea” of many other genetic changes [1-5]. The emerging
picture is that while a few driver-mutations are common
to certain specific cancer sub-types, each patient’s tumor
is fairly unique in its complexity of genetic changes and
that several divergent cancer cell clones may also co-exist,
within a single tumor [1-5].
This enormous level of detail and genetic complexity
makes it extremely difficult to design new diagnostics and
targeted-therapeutics, to achieve the goals of personalized
medicine. There are numerous examples in clinical
practice of how targeting the suspected “driver mutations”
has been disappointing. Cancer control is frequently short
lived, even when these drugs are proven to be effective.
For example, the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib is approved
for the treatment of patients whose melanoma harbors the
V600E mutation, which is thought to be a driver mutation
[6, 7]. However, after treatment with vemurafenib, cancer
progression occurs within six months in the vast majority
of these patients with V600E mutations [6, 7].
Instead, an alternative approach would be to focus
on what is common between different tumor types, rather
than on what is divergent between different cancers.
One common tractable target may be the property of
“stemness” in cancer cells.
Recently, Tomasetti and Vogelstein showed that the
life-time risk of two-thirds of cancers could simply be
accounted for by the number of times that a given tissue’s
stem cells undergo cell division [8]. This is consistent
with the idea that during aging, somatic mutations may
accumulate in tissue stem cells, driving the formation of
cancer stem cells [8]. They further concluded that these
somatic mutations accounted for more cancer cases than
either inherited genetic disease or specific environmental
risk factors. These observations are also consistent with
the idea that cancer is essentially a disease of “stemness”
gone awry [7, 8].
Based on this rather simple premise, using unbiased
quantitative proteomic profiling [9], we have focused
on identifying a global phenotypic property of cancer
stem cells (CSCs) that could be targeted across multiple
tumor types. We have identified this property as a
strict dependence on mitochondrial biogenesis, for the
anchorage-independent clonal expansion and survival of

RESULTS
Overall approach: Finding an Achilles’ heel in
cancer stem cells
Recently, we used an unbiased proteomics approach
to identify what makes cancer stem cells relatively unique,
as compared with ‘bulk’ cancer cells [9]. For this purpose,
we characterized the proteome of mammo-spheres derived
from two different ER(+) breast cancer lines, specifically
MCF7 and T47D cells [9]. Interestingly, we observed that
MCF7 mammo-spheres show the marked over-expression
of >60 mitochondrial-related proteins, as compared with
monolayers; nine of these mitochondrial proteins were
infinitely upregulated in mammo-spheres [9]. These
findings are consistent with the idea that cancer stem cells
are anabolic and that they may require mitochondrial
biogenesis for their survival and proliferative expansion
[9].
To test this hypothesis more directly, here we took
advantage of the known side effects of specific classes of
antibiotics. Because mitochondria evolved from bacteria
that were originally engulfed by eukaryotic cells millions
of years ago (known as the “endosymbiotic theory of
mitochondrial evolution”) [10, 11], many classes of FDAapproved antibiotics actually target mitochondria, as a
mild side-effect, which is well-tolerated in most patients.
More specifically, the erythromycins and
chloramphenicol selectively bind to the large subunit of
the mitochondrial ribosome and inhibit mitochondrial
biogenesis, by preventing the translation of mitochondrial
proteins, mainly related to the mitochondrial OXPHOS
complexes (Figure 1A). Similarly, the tetracyclines
and glycylcyclines both bind with high affinity to the
small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and inhibit
mitochondrial biogenesis as well (Figure 1A).

Thus, these four large classes of antibiotics
all function as known inhibitors of mitochondrial
biogenesis in mammalian cells. This would allow us to
use these antibiotics as “investigational tools” to assess
if mitochondrial biogenesis is absolutely required for
the survival and propagation of cancer stem cells. If
successful, these FDA-approved antibiotics could then
be re-purposed for the treatment of cancer, to achieve the

eradication or more effective elimination of cancer stem
cells (Figure 1B).
If mitochondrial biogenesis is indeed required for
the propagation of all cancer stem cells, then this new
therapeutic approach could be applied across multiple
cancer types, perhaps in a mutation independent fashion.
In essence, we would be treating cancer based instead on
a common global phenotypic property that is characteristic

Figure 1: Treating cancer like an infectious disease, with antibiotics. Recently, using unbiased proteomics analysis, we showed

that mitochondrial proteins were highly upregulated in MCF7 and T47D tumor-spheres, as directly compared with monolayer cells.
Thus, we set out to test the hypothesis that tumor-sphere formation was strictly dependent on mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly,
several known classes of FDA-approved antibiotics function as inhibitors of mitochondrial biogenesis, which results in manageable sideeffects. (A) Bacterial and mitochondrial ribosomes are closely related. Erythromycins and chloramphenicol target the large mitochondrial
ribosome, while tetracyclines and glycylcyclines target the small mitochondrial ribosomes, because of conserved similarities with bacterial
ribosomes. (B) Examples of FDA-approved antibiotics are shown. The structures of erythromycin (a) and tetracycline (b) are shown, along
with pyrvinium pamoate (c). Here, we tested the hypothesis that these different classes of FDA-approved antibiotics could be re-purposed
for the targeting of mitochondrial biogenesis and the eradication of cancer stem cells.

azithromycin inhibits bacterial growth by preventing
protein synthesis. Azithromycin directly binds to the
50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, and specifically
inhibits the translation of mRNA species into protein.
Importantly, the 50S bacterial ribosome is homologous the
39S mitochondrial ribosome. In fact, many of the bacterial
ribosomal subunits have directly-related mitochondrial
homologues in eukaryotic cells. As such, erythromycinrelated antibiotics, e.g., azithromycin, behave as inhibitors
of mitochondrial biogenesis.
Thus, as a first step, we chose to evaluate the
efficacy of azithromycin. For this purpose, azithromycin
was tested for its ability to inhibit mammo-sphere
formation using MCF7 and T47D cells, over a range of
concentrations. Interestingly, in MCF7 cells, azithromycin
inhibited mammo-sphere formation with an IC-50 of ~50
µM; similar results were also obtained in T47D cells
(Figure 3).
As a consequence of these positive findings, we next
tested the ability of azithromycin to inhibit tumor-sphere
formation in a wide-variety of cell lines derived from
many different tumor types, including ER(-) breast cancer,
ovarian, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, as well as
melanoma (summarized in Table 1). For simplicity, we
used a single concentration of 250 µM. Figure 4 (panels A
and B) directly shows that azithromycin inhibited tumorsphere formation in these 8 additional well-established
cell lines, representing 6 different cancer types. Thus,

of cancer stem cells, allowing this approach to be more
broadly applied perhaps to any cancer type (Figure 2).

The Erythromycins: Azithromycin as an example
Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is
currently used for the treatment of many types of bacterial
infections. Azithromycin is a derivative of erythromycin,
and is generally more potent and is more slowly eliminated
than erythromycin, allowing infections to be treated
relatively quickly, over 3-to-5 days. Overall, it shows
broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity. Mechanistically,

disease of increased “stemness”: Developing a
mutation-independent approach to cancer therapy.

One idea is that we could potentially treat cancer as a single
disease, if we could identify a global phenotypic characteristic
that is conserved across multiple cancer types. For this purpose,
we focused on tumor-initiating cells (TICs), a.k.a., cancer stem
cells (CSCs), as they share many common properties, such as
anchorage-independent growth, i.e., tumor-sphere formation
under low-attachment conditions. This global phenotypic
property appears to be functionally dependent on increased
mitochondrial biogenesis.

all contain the same chemically-conserved four-member
ring structure, that is characteristic of tetracycline.
Tetracyclines show bacterio-static activity against nearly
all aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including both Grampositive and Gram-negative types. Tetracyclines inhibit
protein synthesis by preventing the binding of activated
aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A-site on the 30S subunit of
bacterial ribosomes. As such, they reversibly inhibit the
addition of new amino acids to the growing polypeptide
chain, during protein synthesis. Importantly, the 30S
bacterial ribosome is homologous the 28S mitochondrial

The Tetracyclines: Doxycycline provides proof-ofconcept
Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that
is commonly used for the treatment many bacterial
infections, and functions as an inhibitor of protein synthesis
in bacteria. Today, it is mainly used for the treatment of
acne. However, the term “tetracyclines” is also used to

ribosome, accounting for the manageable side-effects of
the tetracyclines. As a consequence, tetracycline-based
antibiotics are inhibitors of mitochondrial biogenesis.
Doxycycline is a tetracycline-derivative with markedly
improved efficacy and stability, which was first FDAapproved in the late 1960s, nearly 50 years ago now.
Thus, we next evaluated the efficacy of the
tetracycline-based antibiotic, doxycycline. More
specifically, doxycycline was tested for its ability to inhibit
mammo-sphere formation using MCF7 and T47D cells,
over a large range of concentrations, from 1 µM to 250
µM. Interestingly, in MCF7 cells, doxycycline inhibited
mammo-sphere formation with an IC-50 between 2 and 10
µM; virtually identical results were also obtained in T47D
cells (Figure 5).
We then tested the ability of doxycycline to inhibit
tumor-sphere formation in a broad panel of cancer cell
lines derived from many different tumor types (Table 1).
For simplicity, we used a single concentration of 50 µM.
Figure 6 (panels A and B) directly shows that doxycycline
inhibited tumor-sphere formation in all of these wellestablished cell lines. Thus, doxycycline was effective
against tumor-sphere formation in all 10 cell lines tested,
across 6 different cancer types.

The glycylcyclines are a relatively new antibiotic
class that are highly-related to the tetracyclines. The
glycylcyclines were designed to specifically overcome
tetracycline resistance. They have essentially the same
mechanism of action as the tetracyclines, as they prevent
bacterial protein synthesis. Both tetracyclines and
glycylcyclines bind to the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit,
thereby inhibiting the binding of a given aminoacyl-tRNA
to the A-site of the ribosome. Importantly, it appears that
glycylcyclines bind more tightly to the ribosome, than
the tetracyclines. Currently, tigecycline is the only FDAapproved glycylcycline. Similarly, the glycylcyclines are
inhibitors of mitochondrial biogenesis.
Interestingly, quantitatively similar results
were obtained with tigecycline, as compared with
doxycycline, showing that it also has the capacity to
inhibit tumor-sphere formation, across all 10 cell lines
tested. Tigecycline was first tested for its ability to inhibit
mammo-sphere formation using MCF7 and T47D cells,
over a concentration range, from 10 µM to 50 µM.
Interestingly, in both MCF7 and T47D cells, tigecycline
inhibited mammo-sphere formation with an IC-50 between
10 and 25 µM (Figure 7). For simplicity, we used a single
concentration of 50 µM, in all eight other cell lines, which
significantly inhibited tumor-sphere formation (Figures 8).

Anti-parasitc drugs: Pyrvinium pamoate
Pyrvinium is a cyanine dye, which is an FDAapproved anti-helmintic drug, that has been used to treat
pinworms, as well as strongyloidiasis in humans. It was
first approved by the FDA in 1955 for the treatment
of enterobiasis, and is known to act as an inhibitor of
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS),
under both normoxia and hypoxic conditions. Several
forms of pyrvinium have been prepared, with different
anions. Here, we tested the efficacy of pyrvinium
pamoate. We used this approach to further validate that
mitochondrial function was indeed critical for the survival
and propagation of cancer stem cells.
For this purpose, pyrvinium pamoate was tested for
its ability to inhibit mammo-sphere formation using MCF7
and T47D cells, over a range of concentrations, from 1 nM
to 500 nM. Interestingly, in both MCF7 and T47D cells,
pyrvinium pamoate inhibited mammo-sphere formation
with an IC-50 between ~10-to-50 nM (Figure 9).
As such, we next tested the ability of pyrvinium
pamoate to inhibit tumor-sphere formation in a widevariety of cell lines derived from many different tumor
types (listed in Table 1); we used two concentrations of
250 nM and 500 nM. Figure 10 (panels A and B) illustrates
that pyrvinium pamoate inhibited tumor-sphere formation
across the entire cell line panel; pyrvinium pamoate was

Evaluating possible toxicity in “bulk” cancer cells
and normal fibroblasts

effective against tumor-sphere formation in all 10 cell
lines tested, in the nano-molar range.

Efficacy of four classes of antibiotics against DCIS
and Glioblastoma CSCs

To evaluate the possible toxicity of our approach on
”bulk” cancer cells and normal fibroblasts, we next used i)
MCF7 cell monolayers and ii) hTERT-immortalized skin
fibroblasts, and assessed their viability using the MTS
assay. For these experiments, we focused on two drugs,
namely doxycycline and pyrvinium pamoate.
For doxycycline, we used a concentration range
from 50 µM to 500 µM. Note that there was little or no
toxicity observed in MCF7 cell monolayers or hTERTBJ1 fibroblasts, over this entire range (Figure 12, panels A
and B). Importantly, 50 µM doxycycline reduced MCF7
mammosphere formation by >95% (Figure 5). Thus,
there is no toxicity for MCF7 cell monolayers or normal
fibroblasts at a concentration that nearly completely
eliminates CSC expansion (and even at 10X times higher).
For pyrvinium pamoate, we used a concentration
range from 500 nM to 5 µM. Importantly, there was
little or no toxicity observed in MCF7 cell monolayers
or hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts (Figure 13, panels A and B).
Interestingly, 500 nM pyrvinium pamoate reduced MCF7
mammosphere formation by >99% (Figure 9). As such,
there is little or no toxicity for MCF7 cell monolayers or
normal fibroblasts at a concentration that eliminates CSC
expansion (and even at 10X times higher).
Importantly, we observed very limited toxicity,
which is consistent with fact that these are well-tolerated
antibiotics that are already FDA-approved for patient
therapy, but are normally used in the context of infectious
disease.

To further assess the efficacy of these four classes
of antibiotics, we also determined their effectiveness in
inhibiting tumor-sphere formation using two other wellestablished cell lines. One was a DCIS-based human cell
line, namely MCF10.DCIS.com, which is often used to
model pre-malignant mammary lesions in breast cancer
patients. The other was derived from one of the most
malignant and aggressive tumor types, glioblastoma (brain
cancer; U-87 MG).
Figure 11 (panels A and B) shows that all four
classes of antibiotics significantly inhibited tumor-sphere
formation in both DCIS.com and U-87 MG cells. Thus,
our approach can also be used to target both pre-malignant
lesions, such as DCIS, or even the most invasive and
aggressive cancer types, such as glioblastoma.
Importantly, azithromycin, doxycycline, and
tigecycline are all known to cross the blood-brain barrier,
making the treatment of brain cancer with these antibiotics
feasible.

Chloramphenicol
Chloramphenicol is a bacterio-static antibiotic used
for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections,
which first became available in the late 1940s. It is a
typical broad-spectrum antibiotic. Like the eyrthromycins
and the tetracyclines, it functions as an inhibitor of protein
synthesis, by binding to the 50S bacterial ribosomal
subunit, thereby inhibiting peptide bond formation.
More specifically, it inhibits peptidyl-transferase activity,
preventing protein chain elongation. Similarly, in
mammalian cells, chloramphenicol behaves an inhibitor
of mitochondrial biogenesis.
Thus, we chose to evaluate the efficacy of
chloramphenicol and determined its ability to inhibit
mammo-sphere formation using MCF7 cells, over a range
of concentrations from 10 µM to 1 mM. Interestingly, in
MCF7 cells, chloramphenicol inhibited mammo-sphere
formation with an IC-50 of ~200 µM (Figure 14). As
such, we have now shown that four independent antibiotic
inhibitors of mitochondrial biogenesis (azithromycin,
doxycycline, tigecycline, and chloramphenicol) all

inhibitors that we tested.

of up to 4-to-6 months or more (200 mg per day).
Doxycycline also encourages the growth of normal stem
cells, has anti-inflammatory properties, and even increases
lifespan, in certain experimental contexts [12-14]. Thus,
the toxic side effects of anti-cancer therapy would be
minimized.
Doxycycline has also been used in human tumor
xenografts and other animal models to significantly reduce
tumor burden and even metastatic cancer cell growth [1520]. For example, in pancreatic tumor xenografts (with
PANC-1 cells), doxycycline treatment reduced tumor
growth by ~80% [20]. In a xenograft model of breast
cancer bone metastasis (with MDA-MB-231 cells),
doxycycline treatment reduced bone and bone-associated
soft-tissue tumor mass by >60% and ~80%, respectively
[19]. However, its anti-cancer activity was attributed to
the inhibition of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs),
rather than the targeting of mitochondrial biogenesis, and
doxycycline has not been previously implicated in the
selective eradication of cancer stem cells [15-20].
Our results are consistent with the previous finding
that metformin, a widely used anti-diabetic drug, which
functions as a mitochondrial inhibitor, can also be used to
selectively target CSCs [21, 22]. Metformin functionally
inhibits OXPHOS by targeting complex I of the electron
transport chain and can even induce lactic acidosis,
as a lethal side effect [21, 22]. As a result, the use of
antibiotics, such as doxycycline, may provide a safer and
far more effective alternative to anti-cancer therapy with
metformin.
Our global phenotypic approach to target cancer as
a single disease of stemness, may also help to avoid drug
resistance. We speculate that genetic changes (oncogenic
mutations, amplifications/deletions, and tumor suppressor
loss) all converge on “stemness” in tumor-initiating
CSCs (Figure 16), driving tumor recurrence, metastasis
and drug resistance. Thus, it would be advantageous to
phenotypically target “stemness” directly, instead of
targeting individual genetic changes, in different cancer
types. This would allow the treatment of cancer in a
mutation-independent fashion.
Finally, recent clinical trials with doxycycline
and azithromycin (intended to treat cancer-associated
infections, but not cancer cells) both show positive
therapeutic effects in cancer patients, although their
selective effects on eradicating cancer stem cells were
not yet known or appreciated [23-26]. These trials were
performed on advanced or treatment-resistant patients
with B-cell lymphoma (doxycycline) or lung cancer
(azithromycin), respectively [23-26]. For example, in
lung cancers, azithromycin significantly increased 1-year
patient survival from 45% to 75%, an ~1.7-fold increase
[26]. Interestingly, it was noted that even lymphoma
patients that were “bacteria-free” benefited from only
a 3-week course of doxycycline therapy, and showed
complete remission of the disease [27]. These results

DISCUSSION
Here, we showed that 4-to-5 different classes of
FDA-approved antibiotics can be used to selectively target
CSCs, across multiple tumor types. Mechanistically, these
antibiotics converge on three main mitochondrial targets,
as summarized in Figure 15. Thus, molecular disruption
of mitochondrial biogenesis or OXPHOS would be a
novel therapeutic strategy for the eradication of CSCs.
As a result, our findings have broad implications for
the initiation of new clinical trials, for the re-purposing
of antibiotics for the treatment of various cancer types,
including “pre-malignant” and advanced metastatic
disease.
This new therapeutic strategy takes advantage of
the manageable side-effects of these antibiotics, which
affect eukaryotic mitochondria, although these compounds
are currently used for the broad-spectrum treatment of
bacterial and parasitic infectious diseases.
In this regard, doxycycline is relatively attractive
as a new anti-cancer agent, as it has a long half-life
systemically and has been used successfully for the longterm treatment of patients with urinary tract infections
(UTI), prostatitis or acne, for extended periods of time,

ability of chloramphenicol to inhibit mammo-sphere formation using MCF7 cells, over a range of concentrations from 10 µM to 1 mM.
Interestingly, in MCF7 cells, chloramphenicol inhibited mammo-sphere formation with an IC-50 of ~200 µM. (*)p <0.002.

suggest that the antibiotic’s therapeutic effects were
actually infection-independent.
Thus, future clinical trials for testing the efficacy
of mitochondrially-targetd antibiotics in multiple cancer
types are now clearly clinically warranted. In this regard,
a clinical trial with doxycycline in patients with advanced
breast cancer and bone metastasis is ongoing: https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01847976.
Secondly,
a trial of doxycycline in relapsed patients with nonhodgkin’s lymphoma has also been initiated: https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02086591. Interestingly,

the A375 human melanoma cell line harbors the
B-RAF(V600E) mutation and we showed that CSCs
derived from this cell line are highly-sensitive to all four of
the antibiotics that we tested (azithromcyin, doxycycline,
tigecycline, and pyrvinium pamoate). As such, additional
cellular studies, and new clinical trails in melanoma
patients with B-RAF mutations, may be indicated, to
explore the use of antibiotics.

Figure 15: Summary of drug discovery. The five-classes of antibiotics that we tested are summarized here, along with their three
corresponding molecular targets, which all converge on mitochondrial biogenesis or OXPHOS.

Figure 16: A mutation-independent approach to cancer therapy. We speculate that genetic changes (oncogenic mutations,

amplifications/deletions, and tumor suppressor loss) all converge on “stemness” in tumor-initiating cells, driving tumor recurrence,
metastasis and drug resistance. Thus, it would be advantageous to phenotypically target “stemness” directly, instead of targeting individual
genetic changes, in different cancer types. This would allow the treatment of cancer as a single disease of stemness, in a mutationindependent fashion.

A single cell suspension was prepared using
enzymatic (1x Trypsin-EDTA, Sigma Aldrich, #T3924),
and manual disaggregation (25 gauge needle) to create a
single cell suspension. Cells were plated at a density of
500 cells/cm2 in mammosphere medium (DMEM-F12/
B27/20ng/ml EGF/PenStrep) in non-adherent conditions,
in culture dishes coated with (2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)
(poly-HEMA, Sigma, #P3932) [28]. Cells were grown for
5 days and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C
at an atmospheric pressure in 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide/air.
After 5 days for culture, spheres >50 µm were counted
using an eye piece graticule, and the percentage of cells
plated which formed spheres was calculated and is referred
to as percentage tumor-sphere formation (TSF), and was
normalized to one (1 = 100 % TSF) [28]. All experiments
were performed in triplicate, three times independently,
such that each data point represents the average of 9
replicates.
For tumor-sphere assays, all cell line derived
spheroids (MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, DCIS.com,
SKOV3, Tov21G, ES2, and A549) were counted at 5 days
after plating, with the exception of PC3, A375, and MIA
PaCa2 cells, which were counted at 3 days post-seeding.
Finally, U-87 MG spheroids were counted at 7 days. All
data shown are the mean +/- the standard error of the mean
(SEM).
