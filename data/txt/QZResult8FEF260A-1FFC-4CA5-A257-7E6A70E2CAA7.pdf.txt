Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Oxidative stress promotes genomic instability and human diseases1. A common oxidized
nucleoside is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine found both in DNA (8-oxo-G) and as a free
nucleotide (8-oxo-dGTP)2,3. Nucleotide pools are especially vulnerable to oxidative damage4.
Therefore cells encode an enzyme (MutT/MTH1) that removes free oxidized nucleotides. This
cleansing function is required for cancer cell survival5,6 and to modulate E. coli antibiotic
sensitivity in a DNA polymerase (pol)-dependent manner7. How polymerase discriminates
between damaged and non-damaged nucleotides is not well understood. This analysis is essential
given the role of oxidized nucleotides in mutagenesis, cancer therapeutics, and bacterial
antibiotics8. Even with cellular sanitizing activities, nucleotide pools contain enough 8-oxo-dGTP
to promote mutagenesis9,10. This arises from the dual coding potential where 8-oxo-dGTP(anti)
base pairs with cytosine (Cy) and 8-oxodGTP(syn) utilizes its Hoogsteen edge to base pair with
adenine (Ad)11. Here we utilized time-lapse crystallography to follow 8-oxo-dGTP insertion
opposite Ad or Cy with human DNA pol β, to reveal that insertion is accommodated in either the
syn- or anti-conformation, respectively. For 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) insertion, a novel divalent metal
relieves repulsive interactions between the adducted guanine base and the triphosphate of the
oxidized nucleotide. With either templating base, hydrogen bonding interactions between the
bases are lost as the enzyme reopens after catalysis, leading to a cytotoxic nicked DNA repair
intermediate. Combining structural snapshots with kinetic and computational analysis reveals how
8-oxodGTP utilizes charge modulation during insertion that can lead to a blocked DNA repair
intermediate.

A primary defense mechanism against oxidative DNA damage is base excision repair, which
in eukaryotes utilizes pol β12,13. During times of oxidative stress, pol β can perform futile
repair by inserting 8-oxo-dGTP opposite Cy or Ad (Fig. 1a-c), and it is implicated in driving
tumorigenesis14,15. Pol β binds to gapped DNA in an open conformation; upon binding the
incoming nucleotide it undergoes a conformational change to form the pre-catalytic closed
complex with two active site divalent metals ions: the catalytic (Mgc) and nucleotide (Mgn)
metals16-18. This complex is optimized for nucleotidyl transfer, forming pyrophosphate
(PPi), and following catalysis, pol β reopens, releasing PPi.

Author Manuscript

Soaking open binary crystals of pol β bound to DNA containing a templating Ad in a
cryosolution with 8-oxo-dGTP and CaCl2 results in a closed pre-catalytic ground state (GS)
ternary complex (Extended Data Table 1). The incoming 8-oxo-dGTP(syn) Hoogsteen base
pairs with Ad (Fig. 1d). The active site is in a similar conformation as previously observed
using a dideoxy-terminated primer (Extended Data Fig. 1a)19, with a change in the primer
terminus sugar pucker to C3’-endo (Extended Data Table 2). Unique active site interactions
include Asn279 hydrogen bonding to O8 of 8-oxo-dGTP(syn) and an intramolecular
hydrogen bond between N2 and the pro-Sp oxygen on Pα of 8-oxodGTP(syn) (Fig. 1d). This
is consistent with previous studies identifying a role of Asn279 in stabilizing 8-oxodGTP(syn)20.

Author Manuscript

To observe catalysis the GS crystals were transferred to a solution containing MgCl2 for 20 s
(Extended Data Table 1). Density corresponding to both the reactant and product was
observed (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1b) and based on occupancy refinement the
reaction is 60% “complete”. In comparison to the GS there is only moderate movement in
the active site, at Pα and O3’ (Extended Data Fig. 1b-c). The Hoogsteen base pairing and
hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the planar synconformation are maintained, and
the enzyme remains in the closed conformation. These observations are consistent with 8oxo-dGTP insertion opposite Ad exhibiting a high catalytic efficiency (Fig. 1c).
Extending the MgCl2 soak time to 40 s resulted in complete turnover of the reactant 8-oxodGTP(syn) in the closed polymerase conformation (Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 1f). This
post-chemistry complex shows the Hoogsteen base pairing and the intramolecular hydrogen
bond at N2 are maintained, and Asn279 hydrogen bonds with O8. The catalytic Mg2+ has
been replaced by Na+, while the nucleotide Mg2+ remains in the active site coordinating PPi
(Extended Data Fig. 1d-e). The closed product complex contains a new Mg2+ product metal
(Mgp) that bridges the backbone phosphate of 8-oxodGMP (syn) and PPi.

Author Manuscript

Extending the MgCl2 soak to 90 s results in a closed-to-open conformational change (Fig.
1g). The PPi and associated metals have disassociated, and the inserted 8-oxo-dGMP (anti)
has lost the interaction between Asn279 and O8, promoting destabilization of the Hoogsteen
base pairing. The inserted 8-oxo-dGMP has a high B-factor (57 Å2; Extended Data Table 1),
with the most stable position displaced into the major groove and a weak hydrogen bond
formed between N6 of Ad and N3 of 8-oxodGMP (Extended Data Fig. 1f).
The insertion efficiency of 8-oxo-dGTP opposite Cy is much less than opposite Ad (Fig. 1c);
this may arise from a clash between O8 and Pα of 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) (Fig. 1a)19,21. To probe

how this clash is accommodated we soaked open binary pol β complex crystals with a
templating Cy in a cryosolution containing 8-oxo-dGTP/CaCl2. The resulting closed ternary
GS complex contains 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) Watson-Crick base pairing with the templating Cy
(Extended Data Table 3 and Fig. 2a). The clash at O8 is partially eased by an altered sugar
pucker, glycosidic angle, buckle, and shear compared to dGTP(anti) (Extended Data Table
2). The incoming 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) N3 and N2 atoms are within hydrogen bonding distance
of Asn279 and Arg283, respectively (Fig. 2b). To determine if these are unique contacts we
solved the structure of dGTP(anti) Watson-Crick base pairing with Cy in the presence of
CaCl2 (Extended Data Table 3). Comparing these two structures indicates the contact with
Arg283 may be unique to the incoming 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) because O8 causes the
triphosphate and base to move 1.1 Å apart (Fig. 2c). This shift promotes the phosphate
backbone of Cy to move 2.6 Å into the minor groove (Fig. 2b). Mutating Arg283 to lysine
or alanine reduced the 8-oxo-dGTP specificity from favoring 8-oxo-dGTP(syn) insertion
opposite Ad by 40-fold for wild-type, to six-fold and two-fold for the R283K and R283A
mutants, respectively (Fig. 2d). This loss of discrimination against insertion of 8-oxodGTP(anti) opposite Cy indicates Arg283 promotes the mutagenic insertion of 8-oxodGTP(syn) by acting as a steric gate to prevent insertion opposite Cy. Interestingly, during
the bypass of 8-oxo-G in the templating position, Arg283 stabilizes the mutagenic synconformation22.

Author Manuscript

The changes described above do not fully alleviate the clash between O8 and the sugarphosphate backbone of the incoming 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) (red dashes in Fig. 2b). Surprisingly,
this clash is accommodated by an additional divalent metal (Cag) observed coordinating the
pro-Sp oxygen of Pα and five water molecules (Fig. 2a-b). Two of the water molecules are
also within hydrogen bonding distance of O8 (Fig. 2b). To verify the presence of this
additional divalent metal binding site near Pα, we soaked the closed pre-catalytic GS
complex (8-oxo-dGTP:Cy) in MnCl2 for 5 s (Extended Data Table 3). This allows metal
exchange before catalysis had appreciatively occurred (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The
presence of Mn2+ in the catalytic, nucleotide, and ground state sites was verified by
anomalous density. Overlaying the GS complex with Ca2+ and Mn2+ verified the ground
state metal site binds divalent cations (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

Author Manuscript

To observe 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) insertion we soaked a GS crystal in MgCl2 for 40 s (Extended
Data Table 3). Pol β remained in the closed conformation with density corresponding to both
product and reactant species (Fig. 2e). Occupancy refinement indicates the reaction is 40%
complete. The Watson-Crick base pairing interactions are maintained with only moderate
movement at the reacting atoms (Pα and O3’; Fig. 2e). The phosphate backbone of the
templating Cy is observed in two conformations corresponding to reactant and product.
Surprisingly, density for both ground state and product metals can be observed, indicating
there are two distinct populations within the crystal (Extended Data Fig. 3).
Soaking pre-catalytic complex crystals in MgCl2 for 60 s results in a closed product
complex (Extended Data Table 3). 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) has been completely inserted with the
sugar pucker shifting from a C4’-exo (GS) to C3’-endo (Extended Data Table 2 and Fig. 3a).
Importantly, there is no density corresponding to the GS metal and only the productassociated metal is present (Fig. 3a-b). The clash at O8 has not been fully alleviated in the

product complex and is likely being mediated by the product Mg2+ (Fig. 3c). Overlaying the
closed ground (0 s) and product states (60 s) indicates that ground state and product metal
binding sites are in distinct positions separated by 2.0 Å that are dependent on having either
substrate or product present (Fig. 3d). Extending the soak time in MgCl2 to 120 s resulted in
pol β transitioning to an open conformation (Extended Data Table 3). Watson-Crick base
pairing is lost, 8-oxo-dGMP stacks over the templating base with a high B-factor (65.2 Å2),
and the remaining PPi and associated metals have dissociated (Fig. 3e).

Author Manuscript

Quantum mechanical analysis allows the point charge on each atom of dGTP(anti) and 8oxo-dGTP(anti) to be calculated (Extended Data Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 4). Figure
4a illustrates the charge difference between 8-oxo-dGTP and dGTP mapped onto each atom
of dGTP. The adducted O8 causes the oxygen bridging the sugar moiety and triphosphate
(O5) to become more positive. Likewise, the pro-Sp oxygen of Pα becomes more negative
and may facilitate recruitment of the GS metal. We also calculated the charge on each atom
of 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) with all three metals (Extended Data Table 4 and Extended Data Fig.
4). Figure 4b shows the difference in charge of 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) with three metals from
that with two metals (Cac and Can) mapped onto the structure of 8-oxo-dGTP(anti). The
largest electronegative change is localized on the triphosphate at key catalytic atoms. This
includes making Pα and Pβ more positive, while their bridging oxygen becomes more
negative.

Author Manuscript

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the pre-catalytic 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) or
dGTP(anti) opposite Cy structures indicate a stable Mgg coordination sphere (Extended Data
Table 5). With 8-oxo-dGTP(anti), one of the Mgg-coordinating water molecules forms a
hydrogen bond with O8, while the inter-atomic distances in the active site maintain proper
catalytic values (Extended Data Fig. 5a-b). In comparison, the dGTP(anti) system exhibits
poor geometry. The average distance of Pα-O3’ increases to 5.25 ± 1.0 Å (Extended Data
Fig. 5c), and the coordination between Mgc and O3’ is broken due to a newly established
coordination network with another water molecule at 40 ns. All these events in the
dGTP(anti) system induce larger RMSD than those of 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) system when the
evolving MD system is compared to the initial structure, indicating that Mgg in the
dGTP(anti) is less favorable and associated with a much less competent-for-chemistry
geometry compared to the 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) system (Extended Data Fig. 5c-d).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, we captured 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) Watson-Crick base pairing in a nearly identical
manner to that observed for dGTP(anti). This required recruitment of an additional divalent
metal near Pα of 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) that forms a stable hydration shell within hydrogen
bonding distance to the adducted oxygen. Consequently, this metal helps alleviate the clash
at O8 and permits binding of 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) without repositioning Pα. A similar
phenomena is observed in the 8-oxo-dGTP(syn) conformation, where the exocyclic N2
forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with Pα, stabilizing good nascent base pair
geometry. This implies that the interaction of Pα by either N2 or a divalent metal cation is a
hallmark characteristic of 8-oxo-dGTP insertion during both mutagenic and non-mutagenic
insertion, respectively.

Damaged substrates complicate the ability of DNA polymerases to select the correct
nucleotide23-25. Structural studies have identified that correct and incorrect non-damaged
nucleotides are discriminated from each other based on proper alignment of catalytic atoms.
The planar nature of 8-oxo-dGTP places O3’ of the primer terminus near Pα so that only
minor structural rearrangements are needed for nucleotidyl transfer. Following insertion of a
correct nucleotide results in a stable ternary product complex, while incorrect insertion
promotes rapid re-opening of the enzyme26. Immediately following 8-oxo-dGTP insertion
the polymerase reopened, similar to an incorrect insertion and implying 8-oxo-dGMP
promotes instability. These findings show that 8-oxo-dGTP utilizes characteristics of both
correct and incorrect insertion elements.

Author Manuscript

Recent structural studies have identified a transient third metal binding site associated with
the products26,27. For pol β, this third metal (Mgp) was only observed in the product
complex following insertion of the correct, but not incorrect, nucleotide. The appearance of
the product metal was unexpected following 8-oxo-dGTP(syn) misinsertion opposite Ad, but
consistent with the good base pair geometry exhibited by this mispair. It appears that these
adjunct metal sites are necessary to neutralize negative charge that may be inherent in the
substrate or that transiently develops during chemistry.

Author Manuscript

We can infer a mechanistic model for the role of these adjunct metal ions during catalysis
(Fig. 4c). In the pre-catalytic GS the primer terminus, Mgc, Mgn, and incoming nucleotide
are bound. Deprotonation of O3’ initiates nucleophilic attack at Pα and as O3’ approaches
Pα it sterically clashes with the non-bridging oxygens of Pα. This results in a transition state
and localized charges on O3’, Pα, and OPα that recruit a metal ion to polarize Pα, thus
facilitating O3’ attack by making Pα more positive and OPα-β more negative. Such a role has
been postulated for a basic side chain in A- and B-family DNA polymerases28. The
accumulating negative charge on OPα-β also promotes protonation of PPi, which has been
proposed to be a key rate-limiting step29. Following product formation this metal could
transfer to the nearby product metal binding site, while the catalytic metal rapidly
dissociates due to the lose of a coordinating ligand (O3’). Accordingly, the appearance/
disappearance of cations around the active site represents an elegant ballet of electrons
during DNA synthesis.

Author Manuscript

The structures captured here reveal how 8-oxo-dGTP escapes general polymerase
discrimination checkpoints by modulating the highly charged DNA polymerase active site.
Importantly, if 8-oxo-dGTP were to be inserted into a single-nucleotide gap, DNA ligase
would be responsible for sealing the nick with a modified base pair. Abnormalities at the
nick would hasten abortive ligation and stabilize the cytotoxic nick, thus increasing the
probability for apoptotic cell signaling30. Similarly, the extension efficiency during errorfree DNA synthesis from the modified base pair would be reduced (i.e., DNA synthesis
would pause), promoting the generation of cytotoxic strand breaks. Therefore, the insertion
and subsequent processing of 8-oxo-G in DNA offers a mechanism to manipulate the
oxidative DNA damage response as well as target cancer cells that have an elevated
metabolic rate.

METHODS SUMMARY
DNA sequences

Author Manuscript

To generate the 16-mer the following DNA sequences were used for crystallization (coding
nucleotide is underlined): template, 5’-CCG ACA/C GCG CAT CAG C-3’; primer, 5’-GCT
GAT GCG C-3’; downstream, 5’-GTC GG-3’. The downstream sequence was 5’phosphorylated. The kinetic studies required extending the downstream and upstream
sequences to employ a 34-mer DNA substrate. The sequence of the template strand was 5’GTA CCC GGG GAT CCG TAC A/CGC GCA TCA GCT GCA G -3’. The underlined A/C
represents the coding nucleotide as either an Ad or Cy. DNA substrates for single-nucleotide
gap filling DNA synthesis measurements were prepared by annealing three purified
oligonucleotides. Each oligonucleotide was suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1
mM EDTA and the concentration was determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. The
annealing reactions were carried out by incubating a solution of primer with downstream
and template oligonucleotides (1:1.2:1.2 molar ratio, respectively) at 95 °C for 5 min
followed by 65 °C for 30 min and finally cooling 1 °C/min to 10 °C in a PCR thermocycler.

Human wild-type, R283A, and R283K DNA polymerase β were overexpressed in E. coli
and purified as described previously31. Binary complex crystals with a templating cytosine
or adenine in a 1-nt gapped DNA were grown as previously described18. The time-lapse
crystallography was performed as previously described and is briefly summarized here26.
Binary pol β:DNA complex crystals were first transferred to a cryosolution containing 15%
ethylene glycol, 50 mM imidazole, pH 7.5, 20% PEG3350, 90 mM sodium acetate, 3 mM 8oxodGTP or dGTP, and 50 mM CaCl2 for 1 h. These ground state (GS) ternary complex
crystals were then transferred to a cryosolution containing 200 mM MgCl2 or MnCl2 for
varying times. All reactions were stopped by freezing the crystals at 100K prior to data
collection at the home source, 1.54 Å, or the Advanced Photon Source, 1.0 Å (Argonne
National Laboratory). In house data collection was done on a SATURN92 CCD detector
system mounted on a MiraMax-007HF rotating anode generator at a wavelength of 1.54 Å.
This allows for anomalous data detection after phasing by molecular replacement. Remote
data collection was done at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT)
BM-22 beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) at a
wavelength of 1.0 Å, with the MAR225 area detector. Data were processed and scaled using
the HKL2000 software package32. Initial models were determined using molecular
replacement with the open binary (3ISB) or closed ternary (2FMS) structures of pol β and all
Rfree flags were taken from the starting model. Refinement was carried out using PHENIX
and model building using Coot33,34. The metal-ligand coordination restraints were generated
by ReadySet (PHENIX) and not utilized until the final rounds of refinement. Partial
catalysis models were generated with both the reactant and product species and occupancy
refinement was performed. The figures were prepared in PyMol and all density maps were
generated after performing simulated annealing35. Ramachandran analysis determined 100%
of nonglycine residues lie in allowed regions and at least 97% in favored regions.

Kinetic characterization

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Steady-state kinetic parameters for single-nucleotide gap filling reactions with wild-type
enzyme were determined by initial velocity measurements as described previously36. Unless
noted otherwise, enzyme activities were determined using a standard reaction mixture
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (37 °C), 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 200 nM singlenucleotide gapped DNA. Enzyme concentrations and reaction time intervals were chosen so
that substrate depletion or product inhibition did not influence initial velocity measurements.
Due to the low activity of the Arg283 mutants (alanine and lysine), the catalytic efficiencies
were determined by single-turnover analysis as described before except that the
enzyme/DNA ratio was 10 37. Reactions were quenched with 0.3 M EDTA and mixed with
an equal volume of 95% formamide dye. The substrates and products were separated on
16% denaturing (8 M urea) polyacrylamide gels. Since a 6-carboxyfluorescein 5’-labeled
primer was used in these assays, the substrates and products were quantified using a GE
Typhoon 8600 phosphorimager in fluorescence mode (532 nm laser, 526 short pass filter).
Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the rate data to a hyperbolic equation. When
the observed rates could not be saturated owing to weak substrate binding, the data were
fitted to an alternate form of the equation to extract catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM, best-fit
initial slope). kobs = ((kcat/KM) * [S]) / (1 + ([S]/KM)) The mean and standard error of at least
two independent determinations are illustrated in plots that highlight substrate
discrimination.

The three systems are shown in Extended Data Figure 4 and described here. They are (1) 8oxoGTP(anti) with the Cac, Can, Cag ions, the coordinating 8 water molecules, and the three
acetate ions (mimicking Asp190, 192, and 256 of pol β); (2) all atoms in system 1 except for
the Cag and its coordinating water molecules; (3) dGTP(anti) with the Cac, Can, Cag ions,
the coordinating 8 water molecules, and the three acetate ions (mimicking Asp190, 192, and
256 of pol β). The base of 8-oxoGTP was optimized under minimum constraints to keep the
geometries closer to the crystallographic structure at the B3LYP level of theory with the
6-31+g* basis set using the program Gaussian09.D0138. All charges were calculated using
the ChelpG procedure in Gaussian09.D01 at the 6-31++g** basis set level39.
Molecular dynamics simulations

Author Manuscript

Two reference systems were simulated by MD for 80 ns. System 1 was prepared using the
entire GS 8-oxodGTP(anti):Cy crystal structure (0 s). It consists of the DNA, 8oxodGTP(anti), pol β, 302 crystal water molecules, and three Mg2+ ions that replace the
Ca2+ ions in the crystal structure at the catalytic, nucleotide, and ground metal binding sites.
System 2 was prepared as system 1, but with 8-oxodGTP replaced by dGTP(anti). For all
structures, missing atoms were added using CHARMM40, and the disordered residues 1-10
of polymerase were attached by Accelrys Discovery Studio. Both systems were solvated
with TIP3P water molecules. The smallest image distance between the solute and the faces
of the periodic cubic cell is set to 12 Å. The total number of water atoms is 49089 and total
number of atoms is 55521. Neutralizing ions (Na+) and 150 mM NaCl were added to both

systems. All of the Na+ and Cl− ions were placed at least 8 Å away from each other, pol β,
and the DNA. Both systems were minimized with fixed positions for all heavy atoms of pol
β and DNA for 10,000 steps. The equilibration process was started with a 200 ps simulation
at 300K using Langevin dynamics, while keeping all the heavy atoms of pol β and DNA
fixed. This was followed by unconstrained minimization consisting of 20,000 steps. The
systems were then equilibrated for 500 ps at constant pressure and temperature. Pressure
was maintained at 1 atm using the Langevin piston method41. The temperature was
maintained at 300K using weakly coupled Langevin dynamics of nonhydrogen atoms with a
damping coefficient of 10 ps−1. The systems were simulated in periodic boundary conditions
with full electrostatics computed using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method42. Shortrange nonbonded terms were evaluated at every step using a 12 Å cutoff for van der Waals
interactions and a smooth switching function. The production simulations were performed
for 80 ns with a 2 fs timestep. The minimization, equilibration, and production MD
simulations were performed by NAMD simulation package43 with the CHARMM27 allatom force field 44-46. The force field parameters for 8-oxoG were adopted from earlier
works47,48. The average distances and standard deviations are calculated using MD
trajectories in the 50-80 ns time range.

a, The 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) opposite Cy at 80 ns superimposed upon the initial structure. A
multicolor code based on atom type is used for the final MD structure, whereas the reference
initial structure is shown in light grey. The catalytic (Mgc), nucleotide (Mgn), and ground
(Mgg) magnesium metal ions are shown in green, and average distances over the course of
the simulation are indicated for Pα-O3’ and Mgc-O3’. b, Distance distributions between
hydrogen atoms in the water shell and O8 in the 8-oxo-dGTP(anti):Cy simulation. A
snapshot of the 8-oxo-dGTP, Mgg and water shell (W(g1-g5)) is plotted at top. Black and
red dotted lines indicate Mgg coordination and a hydrogen-bonding interaction between a
water molecule and O8, respectively. Four of the five water molecules in the water shell
(W(g1-g4)) contribute to hydrogen-bonding interactions with O8. Blue and orange lines
indicate distances between hydrogen atoms in each water molecule and O8. The red line in
the bottom plot indicates the minimum distance between hydrogen atoms in the water shell
and O8. c, The dGTP(anti) opposite Cy at 80 ns superimposed upon the initial structure
(grey). Distances and ion labeling are as for a. d, RMSD of the evolving MD structure for
the entire polymerase/DNA complex (top) and for the active site only (bottom), with respect
to the crystal structure.
