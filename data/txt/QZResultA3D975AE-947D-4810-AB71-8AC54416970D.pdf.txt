BACKGROUND: The authors sought to improve the toxicity of conventional concurrent chemoradiation therapy for
stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by using proton-beam therapy to escalate the radiation dose to the tumor. They report early results of a phase 2 study of high-dose proton therapy and concurrent chemotherapy in terms
of toxicity, failure patterns, and survival. METHODS: Forty-four patients with stage III NSCLC were treated with 74
grays (radiobiologic equivalent) proton therapy with weekly carboplatin (area under the curve, 2 U) and paclitaxel
(50 mg/m2). Disease was staged with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT), and treatments
were simulated with 4-dimensional (4D) CT to account for tumor motion. Protons were delivered as passively scattered beams, and treatment simulation was repeated during the treatment process to determine the need for adaptive replanning. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 19.7 months (range, 6.1-44.4 months), and median overall
survival time was 29.4 months. No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 proton-related adverse events. The most common nonhematologic grade 3 toxicities were dermatitis (n ¼ 5), esophagitis (n ¼ 5), and pneumonitis (n ¼ 1). Nine
(20.5%) patients experienced local disease recurrence, but only 4 (9.1%) had isolated local failure. Four (9.1%) patients
had regional lymph node recurrence, but only 1 (2.3%) had isolated regional recurrence. Nineteen (43.2%) patients
developed distant metastasis. The overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 86% and 63% at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent high-dose proton therapy and chemotherapy are well tolerated, and the median survival

Lung cancer remains the most common cause of death from cancer in the United States.1 About 75% of patients
present with locally advanced disease, for which the current standard therapy is concurrent chemotherapy and radiation
therapy.2-4 However, the toxicity associated with concurrent chemoradiation can be significant, and locoregional failure
rates remain high at 40% to 50%.2-4 Several studies have shown potential benefits in terms of both local control and
survival from the use of 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation therapy with radiation doses of up to 74 grays (Gy)
with concurrent weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy,5-7 but 74 Gy is the maximum tolerated dose when the
radiation is delivered as photons (x-rays).7
Proton beams, unlike photon beams, consist of charged particles that have a well-defined range of penetration into
tissue.8,9 Tissues beyond this range are not irradiated. Thus, proton beam therapy is ideal when normal tissue sparing is a
priority, for example, in lung cancer given the proximity of the esophagus, heart, and spinal cord.9

Original Article

We conducted a phase 2 prospective study of proton
therapy to a dose of 74 Gy (radiobiologic equivalent
[RBE]) at 2 Gy(RBE)/fraction given concurrently with
weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy for patients
with inoperable stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). This is the first report of this approach for
stage III NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients, Treatment, and Study Design
This phase 2 prospective study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier
NCT00495170) was approved by the institutional review
board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center, and all patients provided written informed consent to participate. Forty-four patients with unresectable
or medically inoperable, histologically or cytologically
confirmed stage III NSCLC (according to the 2002
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system)
were enrolled and evaluated from 2006 to 2009. Disease
in all cases was staged with magnetic resonance imaging or
computed tomography (CT) of the brain, CT of the
chest, and positron emission tomography (PET) within
3 months before enrollment. Other eligibility criteria
included having good performance status (Karnofsky
scores of 70-100) and weight loss of no greater than 10%
during the 6 months before diagnosis.
Treatment Simulation and Target
Volume Delineation
Proton therapy was delivered with a variable energy
synchrotron. All patients underwent treatment simulation
with 4-dimensional CT to account for tumor motion.
The internal gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as
the envelope of motion of the GTV on a reconstructed
maximum intensity projection image and verified across
all phases of the 4-dimensional CT dataset.10 An 8 mm
isotropic expansion of the internal GTV was added and
edited to cover possible microextensions of the tumor,
and the resulting volume was defined as the internal clinical target volume (internal GTV þ 8 mm). Elective
lymph nodes were not irradiated intentionally.
Radiation Doses
The total radiation dose to the tumor target was 74 Gy
(RBE), given in once-daily 2 Gy (RBE) fractions, 5 days
per week. Treatment plans were designed in accordance
with the following dose-volume constraints: spinal cord,
0% to receive 45 Gy (RBE); normal lung, 35% to

4708

receive 20 Gy (RBE); mean dose to entire lung, 20 Gy
(RBE); heart, 30% to receive 40 Gy (RBE); esophagus,
50% to receive 50 Gy (RBE); 40% to receive 70 Gy
(RBE); 0% to receive 80 Gy (RBE).
Passive Scattering Proton Therapy Planning
and Adaptive Proton Delivery
The internal GTV, with the maximum intensity projection density from the set of 3D CT scans used to derive
the 4D CT, was used to design compensators and apertures to account for tumor motion, and the treatment
plan was calculated by using the average of the phase of
the 4D CT.8-11 Another set of 4D CT scans was obtained
during Week 3 or 4 of treatment (or as clinically indicated
as assessed by the treating physician) to document tumor
shrinkage or other anatomic or motion-based changes. If
the changes derived from the new dose distribution could
not meet the minimum target dose requirement of 95%
of the prescribed dose, or if they exceeded normal tissue
dose constraints, a new treatment plan was designed for
the remainder of the treatments.
Chemotherapy
All patients received concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel
chemotherapy as weekly intravenous infusions during
proton therapy. Paclitaxel was administered at 50 mg/m2,
and carboplatin was given at 2 area under the curve units.
Neoadjuvant (induction) chemotherapy was allowed, and
adjuvant (consolidation) chemotherapy with carboplatin
and paclitaxel at systemic doses was also allowed.
Evaluation and Follow-Up
Patients were evaluated at least weekly during treatment,
at 6 weeks after completing the proton therapy, and then
every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter.
Adverse events were noted and graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3. Follow-up visits
included an interval medical history and physical examination, hematologic studies, and CT scans. Follow-up
PET scans were required during the first 2 to 6 months after treatment or as needed if clinically indicated.
Local control at the primary tumor site was evaluated by serial thoracic CT scans with contrast. If CT
scans showed evidence of recurrent disease, then PET or
PET/CT was required and biopsy recommended to
confirm recurrence. Unconfirmed recurrent disease was to
be followed up with CT or PET. The timing of the recurrence was scored as the time at which the first image (PET

time was calculated from the date of protocol enrollment
to last follow-up.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was the median overall survival
time after proton therapy administered with concurrent
chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the median overall
survival time would be increased from a baseline of
16 months to 28 months. By using the normal approximation, we calculated that 44 patients would need to be
enrolled to have an 80% chance of demonstrating
improvement using a 1-sided test with significance level
of .05. Survival was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and the survival curves were compared with logrank tests (SPSS v.16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Characteristics of the 44 enrolled patients are listed in
Table 1. At a median follow-up time of 19.7 months
(range, 6.1-44.4 months) for all patients (23.3 months
[range, 10.3-44.4 months] for living patients), the median
overall survival time was 29.4 months (mean  standard
deviation, 28.5  12.4 months). The overall survival and
progression-free survival rates at 1 year were 86% and
63%; Kaplan-Meier estimates at 2 years and 3 years are
shown in Figure 1. Patterns of failure are listed in Table 2.
Nine (20.5%) patients experienced recurrence within the
treated area, but only 4 (9.1%) of those patients had
isolated local failure. Another 4 (9.1%) patients experienced first recurrence in regional lymph nodes, but only 1
(2.3%) of those patients developed isolated regional
recurrence. The dominant pattern of failure was distant
metastasis (19 patients, 43.2%).
The toxicity profile is shown in Table 3. No patient
experienced grade 5 toxicity; 5 (11.4%) patients developed chemotherapy-related grade 4 toxicity. The most
common grade 3 adverse effects related to proton therapy
were dermatitis and esophagitis, each experienced by 5
(11.4%) patients; 1 (2.3%) patient developed grade 3
pneumonitis, and 1 patient had a pulmonary/pleural
fistula. Median values of lung V20 (ie, the volume of lung
exposed to 20 Gy), V10, and V5 were 25.7% (range,
9.5%-36.4%), 29.8% (range, 13.4%-42.8%), and 32.8%
(range, 14.2%-48.3%), respectively. Because of the
unique physical characteristics of the proton beam, the
median absolute increase of lung volume from V5 to V20
was only 7.1%. The median mean dose to the entire lung

heart was 6.9% (range, 0.0%-41.6%); the median V50 for
the esophagus was 20.4% (range, 0.0%-51.2%); the mean
dose to the esophagus was 21.2 Gy; and the median maximum dose to the spinal cord was 33.9 Gy (range, 18.342.3 Gy).
To improve target coverage and spare critical structures, all patients had repeated 4D CT treatment simulations during treatment (typically after 3 weeks of proton
therapy), and 11 (25%) patients underwent adaptive
replanning/therapy.

DISCUSSION
We found that proton therapy to 74 Gy (RBE), given in
combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy, produced a median survival time of 29.4 months,

with improved nonhematologic acute toxicity (grade 3:
esophagitis 11.4%, pneumonitis 2.3%; no grade 4
toxicity) and late toxicity (pulmonary-pleural fistula
2.3%) compared with other studies.2,7 In RTOG 0117,7
in which 74 Gy was delivered with concurrent carboplatin
and paclitaxel, the median overall survival time for
patients with stage III disease was 21.6 months. For all
patients enrolled (stage I-III), grade 3-4 acute nonhematologic toxicity rate was 57%, grade 3-4 late radiation toxicity rate was 20%, grade 5 acute toxicity rate was 4%, and
grade 5 late toxicity rate was 2%. However, RTOG 0117
did not use a 4D CT-based internal GTV approach or
heterogeneity corrections. The toxicity rates in the current
study are also better than our institutional experience with
the highly conformal delivery of intensity-modulated
(photon) radiation therapy to 63 Gy with concurrent
chemotherapy for stage III NSCLC (44% grade 3
esophagitis and 9% grade 3 pneumonitis).12
Our toxicity profile was notable for the rarity of
severe (grade 3) side effects, especially esophagitis and
pneumonitis, relative to photon irradiation, either at
lower doses (60-63 Gy) or at the equivalent dose of
74 Gy. The lesser toxicity associated with concurrent proton
and chemotherapy could have resulted from reduced
exposure of normal tissues, particularly the critical structures
surrounding the target volume, to high doses. In addition to
this reduction in high-dose exposure, the substantial reduction in low-dose exposure, including the lower integral
dose9,13 to the nontarget tissues, could have had significant
influence in improving normal tissue tolerance.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publication on concurrent chemotherapy and proton therapy
for stage III NSCLC; only 2 prior published reports have
described the use of proton therapy alone for stage III
NSCLC. Shioyama et al14 described 9 patients with stage
III NSCLC treated with proton therapy alone in whom
the 2-year cause-specific survival rate was 70%. Nakayama
et al15 studied 35 patients with stage II/III NSCLC treated

with proton therapy alone to a median dose of 78.3 Gy
(range, 67.1-91.3 Gy); 11.4% of the patients in that study
developed local recurrence, 37.1% regional recurrence,
and 20% distant metastasis. The 2-year overall survival
rate was 58.9%, and no patients experienced grade 3
toxicity. This local recurrence rate seems similar to that of
the current study (20.5%); the apparently higher regional
recurrence rate (37.1% vs 9.1% in our study) could have
been because of the lack of chemotherapy or PET/CT for
disease staging in that study. The higher rate of distant
metastasis in our study (43.2%) could have been because
our patients underwent scheduled PET/CT scans during
their follow-up visits, which increases the likelihood of
detecting distant metastatic disease. Disease recurrence
that occurs as distant metastatic disease has an aggressive
phenotype, highlighting the need for additional novel or
more aggressive chemotherapy regimens, perhaps with
molecular targeted therapy, in the future. Two other studies of proton therapy with chemotherapy for stage III
NSCLC are ongoing at Loma Linda University Medical
Center and the University of Florida.16
Some concern has been expressed that rates of elective
lymph node failure could be higher with proton therapy
than with x-ray–based therapy because of the reduced scattering dose to adjacent regional lymph nodes from proton
therapy; this scatter is thought to help prevent elective nodal
failure when only involved fields are irradiated.17 However,
only 1 (2.3%) patient in our study developed isolated nodal
failure, indicating that prophylactic elective nodal irradiation is not indicated with our current staging workup and
current proton dose; rather, total local failure (20.5%) and
distant metastasis (43.2%) were the predominant patterns
of recurrence. The rate of regional lymph node recurrence
in our study (9.1%) was not unexpected, given the size and
location of the lesions. The 20.5% total local failure rate
indicates that there is room for improvement. Possible reasons for local failure include the following: 1) a dose of
74 Gy (RBE) may not be enough to eliminate some radiation-resistant cancer cells; 2) inaccuracies in target delineation or tight radiotherapy margins and inadequate target
coverage caused by complicated anatomy (eg, tumors curving around the esophagus, spinal cord, or brachial plexus)
could have resulted in marginal misses; and 3) the 4D simulation and planning techniques may not have fully
addressed tumor motion within fractions11,18 or between
fractions, or anatomic changes resulting from the treatment
or the disease process.19
Our study did have some shortcomings, chiefly the
heterogeneity of the patient population and the relatively

4712

short follow-up time. Neither induction nor adjuvant
chemotherapy was standardized, and the small tumor
volumes (median GTV, 101 cm3) complicate comparison
of these findings with others in the literature. The mean
lung dose (14.3 Gy), lung V20 (24.9%), and mean esophageal dose (21.2 Gy) in our study were similar to those of
RTOG 0117; however, the lesser toxicity, especially
pneumonitis and esophagitis, in our study suggests that
differences in other dosimetric variables such as low dose
exposure may also be informative with regard to predicting toxicity.
Collectively, these findings suggest that passively
scattered proton therapy has the potential for delivering
high radiation doses in combination with concurrent
chemotherapy and can achieve promising survival with
tolerable toxicity for patients with stage III lung cancer.
Further improvements in conformality for cases involving
complicated anatomy, such as tumors that curve around
sensitive critical structures, can be achieved by intensitymodulated proton therapy,20 which is delivered with
scanning beams rather than scattered beams and can
simultaneously optimize the intensities and energies of all
scanning beams by using an objective function that
accounts for target coverage as well as normal tissue constraints. This technique allows further dose escalation and
could lead to improved local control and survival even
for patients with more extensive disease. However, the
uncertainties associated with tumor and organ motion
during the 7-week treatment period remain the main concern for proton therapy, particularly intensity-modulated
proton therapy.11,18-20

Conclusions
Our current study shows that high-dose proton therapy
with concurrent chemotherapy is well tolerated, and the
29.4-month median survival time and 20.5% total local
failure rate are encouraging for inoperable stage III
NSCLC. These findings will be useful for a planned prospective phase 2 randomized study comparing proton
therapy versus intensity-modulated (photon) radiation
therapy, both to 74 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy,
for stage III NSCLC (clinicaltrials.gov identifier
NCT00495040).
