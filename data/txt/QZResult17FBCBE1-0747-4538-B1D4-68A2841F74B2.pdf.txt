Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer cells exhibit metabolic dependencies that distinguish them from their normal
counterparts1. Among these addictions is an increased utilization of the amino acid glutamine
(Gln) to fuel anabolic processes2. Indeed, the spectrum of Gln-dependent tumors and the
mechanisms whereby Gln supports cancer metabolism remain areas of active investigation. Here
we report the identification of a non-canonical pathway of Gln utilization in human pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells that is required for tumor growth. While most cells utilize

glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1) to convert Gln-derived glutamate (Glu) into α-ketoglutarate in
the mitochondria to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, PDAC relies on a distinct pathway to
fuel the TCA cycle such that Gln-derived aspartate is transported into the cytoplasm where it can
be converted into oxaloacetate (OAA) by aspartate transaminase (GOT1). Subsequently, this OAA
is converted into malate and then pyruvate, ostensibly increasing the NADPH/NADP+ ratio which
can potentially maintain the cellular redox state. Importantly, PDAC cells are strongly dependent
on this series of reactions, as Gln deprivation or genetic inhibition of any enzyme in this pathway
leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species and a reduction in reduced glutathione. Moreover,
knockdown of any component enzyme in this series of reactions also results in a pronounced
suppression of PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we establish that the
reprogramming of Gln metabolism is mediated by oncogenic Kras, the signature genetic alteration
in PDAC, via the transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic enzymes in this
pathway. The essentiality of this pathway in PDAC and the fact that it is dispensable in normal
cells may provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat these refractory tumors.
The prognosis of patients with PDAC remains dismal. The disease is extremely aggressive
and is profoundly resistant to all forms of therapy3. Thus, there is a strong impetus to
identify new therapeutic targets for this cancer. In recent years, there has been renewed
interest in understanding the altered metabolism in cancer, and how such dependencies can
be targeted for therapeutic gain. However, achieving a successful therapeutic index remains
a major challenge to the development of effective cancer therapies that target metabolic
pathways.

Recent evidence demonstrates that some cancer cells utilize glutamine (Gln) to support
anabolic processes that fuel proliferation2. However, the importance of Gln metabolism in
pancreatic tumor maintenance is not known. Thus, we sought to explore the dependence of
PDAC on Gln, and to examine the functional role of Gln in PDAC metabolism. As expected
from our previous work4, glucose was required for PDAC growth. Additionally, PDAC cells
were also profoundly sensitive to Gln deprivation, indicating that Gln is also critical for
PDAC growth (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Gln provides a carbon source to fuel the TCA cycle and nitrogen for nucleotide, nonessential
amino acid (NEAA) and hexosamine biosynthesis5,6. To assess the role of Gln metabolism
in PDAC growth, we first impaired glutaminase (GLS) activity using RNA interference
(RNAi). Notably, GLS knockdown markedly reduced PDAC growth (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Consistent with this observation, Glutamate (Glu) was able to
support growth in Gln-free conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

Glu can be converted into α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to replenish the TCA cycle metabolites
through two mechanisms1; either by glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1) or transaminases
(Fig. 1c). Indeed, many cancer cells rely on GLUD1-mediated Glu deamination to fuel the
TCA cycle7, and αKG has been shown to be an essential metabolite in Gln metabolism8.
Surprisingly, dimethyl αKG9 did not restore growth upon Gln deprivation (Fig. 1d), whereas
the combination of αKG and an NEAA mixture (the output of transaminase-mediated Glu
metabolism) dramatically rescued proliferation in multiple PDAC lines (Fig. 1d and
Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). Together, this data suggests that PDAC cells metabolize Gln in a

manner that is different from canonical models10 and that this class of enzymes may be
critical for Gln metabolism in PDAC.

Author Manuscript

To confirm the importance of transaminases in PDAC Gln metabolism, we treated PDAC
cells with either aminooxyacetate (AOA), a pan-inhibitor of transaminases11, or
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an inhibitor of GLUD112. While EGCG had no effect on
PDAC growth, AOA treatment robustly inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Consistent with these results, GLUD1 knockdown also had no
effect on PDAC growth (Fig. 2a). To identify the specific transaminase(s) involved in
PDAC Gln metabolism, we inhibited a panel of Glu-dependent transaminases (aspartate,
alanine and phosphoserine transaminase) individually using RNAi and examined the effect
on PDAC growth. Interestingly, knockdown of the aspartate transaminase GOT1
significantly impaired PDAC growth in multiple PDAC cell lines and primary PDAC cells
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4, 5).

We next explored the direct effects of GOT1 on Gln metabolism by performing targeted
metabolomic analysis in GOT1 knockdown PDAC cells using uniformly 13C-labeled Gln
([U-13C5]-Gln) as a tracer4,13. GOT1 catalyzes the conversion of aspartate (Asp) and αKG
into OAA and Glu in the cytoplasm. Indeed, GOT1 knockdown led to increased Gln-derived
Asp (and total Asp) and decreased OAA (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Interestingly,
we also observed a significant decrease in the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione
(GSH:GSSG; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 6b), suggesting that GOT1 may play a role in
the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. It should be noted that the changes in
metabolite abundance described in this experiment are representative of the total cellular
metabolite pool, due to technical limitations associated with organelle-specific metabolite
isolation. Importantly however, the results we obtained are consistent with what one would
expect if flux through GOT1 was impaired.

In PDAC, we recently demonstrated that oncogenic Kras enhances the flux of glycolytic
intermediates specifically through the non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) (for DNA/RNA biosynthesis) without effecting the NADPH-producing oxidative
arm4. This decoupling of ribose biogenesis from NADPH production by Kras suggests that
PDAC cells may rely on an alternative mechanism to maintain cellular redox balance.
Indeed, inhibition of the oxidative PPP in PDAC by knockdown of the rate limiting enzyme
G6PD had minimal effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and, consistent with this,
glucose deprivation had only a modest impact on ROS (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Therefore,
we speculated that the GOT1-mediated conversion of Gln-derived Asp into OAA functions
in a pathway that is used to generate the NADPH which could be used to maintain redox
balance. To test this hypothesis, we assessed ROS levels upon Gln deprivation in the
absence or presence of OAA. Indeed, Gln deprivation induced ROS and OAA could
partially rescue the elevated ROS levels (Fig. 2c). GOT1 knockdown also increased ROS
levels, which again were significantly restored upon supplementation with OAA (Fig. 2d).
Given that Gln-derived malate (and total malate) was significantly reduced upon GOT1
knockdown (Fig. 2b), we suspected that Gln-derived OAA is metabolized into malate, which
is utilized by malic enzyme (ME1) to create NADPH, providing the reducing power to

maintain reduced glutathione pools14. Indeed, malate was able to partially rescue the
oxidative stress imposed by Gln-deprivation (Fig. 2e) or GOT1 knockdown (Fig. 2f). These
data are consistent with a model whereby Gln-derived Asp is converted by GOT1 into OAA,
then converted into malate by malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) and subsequently oxidized by
ME1 into pyruvate and reducing power in the form of NADPH (Fig. 2g). Consistent with
this pathway, metabolomic analysis of [U-13C5]-Gln tracing in ME1 knockdown cells
revealed a significant increase in Asp, malate and OAA and decreased GSH (Fig. 2h and
Supplementary Fig. 6d). Furthermore, knockdown of GOT1 and ME1 markedly increased
the cellular NADP+/NADPH ratio (Fig. 2i), whereas inhibition of other cytosolic sources of
NADPH (G6PD or isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH1) had no effect on NADP+/NADPH
ratios or ROS (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Together the data suggest that PDAC
utilize Gln through the pathway depicted in Fig. 2g to increase the NADPH/NADP+ ratio for
maintenance of redox homeostasis. Lastly, Gln tracing kinetic flux experiments in GOT1
knockdown cells clearly demonstrate decreased flux through this pathway (Fig. 2j and
Supplementary Fig. 7). Interestingly, lactate labeling in the 13C-labeling experiments was
typically at very low levels, indicating that the pyruvate produced by ME1 is not utilized to
make lactate by lactate dehydrogenase and has a yet undetermined fate.

Author Manuscript

The majority of Asp in PDAC cells (50–75%) is derived from Gln, as evidenced by 13Clabeling (Supplementary Fig. 6a, d and 8a). In principle, uniformly 13C-labeled Asp can be
derived from Gln following either (i) the GLUD1-mediated conversion of Glu to αKG (and
its subsequent traversing through the TCA cycle) or (ii) the mitochondrial aspartate
transaminase (GOT2)-mediated conversion of Glu and OAA to αKG and Asp. Of these two
enzymes, only GOT2 knockdown significantly impacted PDAC growth (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Fig. 8b). Consistent with this observation, GLUD1 knockdown did not affect
Asp biosynthesis from Gln, whereas GOT2 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in
Gln-derived Asp in PDAC cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a, c).

Author Manuscript

We next tested whether other components of this pathway are also necessary to support
PDAC growth. Indeed, knockdown of either MDH1 or ME1 also dramatically inhibited
clonogenic survival of PDAC cells (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 9) in a manner
similar to GOT1 knockdown. As a further test of enzyme knockdown specificity, we
investigated the ability of central metabolites in this pathway to rescue PDAC growth upon
Gln deprivation. First, we confirmed that exogenously added metabolites permeated the cell
and populated metabolite pools (Supplementary Fig. 10). Next, we demonstrated that the
combination of GOT1 substrates, Asp and αKG, could rescue cell growth in Gln-free
conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Additionally, OAA permitted PDAC growth under
Gln-free conditions in multiple PDAC cell lines (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 11a–d) as
well as upon both GLS (Supplementary Fig. 12a) and GOT1 knockdown (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). Lastly, the addition of dimethyl-malate15 was able to partially
rescue PDAC cell growth upon Gln deprivation (Supplementary Fig. 13c) or GOT1
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 13d).
Next, to confirm that the OAA- or malate rescue of PDAC growth upon Gln deprivation was
through maintenance of redox homeostasis, we treated cells grown in Gln-free conditions
with a cell permeable GSH analog. Remarkably, GSH dramatically rescued clonogenic

growth following Gln-deprivation (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 11c) or GOT1
knockdown (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). GSH was also able to rescue either
MDH1 or ME1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Near identical results were also seen
with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (Fig. 3e and f and Supplementary Fig. 14b, c).
Together, these data support the idea that Gln is utilized by PDAC cells to maintain redox
homeostasis, which is required to support continued tumor growth.
As further confirmation of the importance of this pathway in PDAC, we suppressed GOT1,
MDH1, and ME1 expression using two lentiviral shRNAs in PDAC cells and assessed their
ability to grow as xenografts. Consistent with our in vitro results, both GLUD1 shRNAs had
no effect on tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. 15). In contrast, GOT1, MDH1, and ME1
knockdown each robustly diminished tumor growth (Fig. 3g). These data provide further
support for the critical role of this pathway in Gln metabolism and PDAC tumor growth.

In contrast to PDAC, this pathway appears to be dispensable in normal cells. Indeed,
treatment of non-transformed human pancreatic ductal cells (HPDE) and human diploid
fibroblasts (IMR90) with AOA had only modest effects on growth (Supplementary Fig.
16a). HPDE cells, unlike PDAC cells, were significantly sensitive to EGCG, suggesting a
greater reliance on the activity of GLUD1 (Supplementary Fig. 16b). Consistent with these
results, GOT1 knockdown did not impair the growth of HPDE and IMR90 (Supplementary
Fig. 16c). We also obtained similar results in mouse ductal epithelial cells (mPDE) and
mouse PDAC cell lines, with the mPDEs being highly insensitive to AOA and GOT1
knockdown and two independently derived mouse PDAC lines exhibiting significant
sensitivity to AOA and GOT1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 16d, e). Furthermore, using
an inducible shGOT1 construct, we demonstrated that mouse PDAC rely on GOT1 to
sustain tumor growth in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 17). Collectively, these data demonstrate
that the GOT1-mediated utilization of the Gln carbon skeleton is a metabolic adaptation that
PDAC, and not normal cells, have uniquely acquired to support growth.

Author Manuscript

Our previous work demonstrated that anabolic glucose metabolism in PDAC is controlled
by oncogenic Kras, which leads to altered expression of a number of rate-limiting metabolic
enzymes4. To investigate the role of Kras in the reprogramming of Gln metabolism, we
assessed the expression of GOT1 and GLUD1 upon knockdown of Kras in PDAC cells.
Interestingly, Kras knockdown resulted in a marked increase in GLUD1 and a decrease in
GOT1 expression at the transcriptional level (Fig. 4a), as well as the protein level (Fig. 4b)
in multiple PDAC lines (Supplementary Fig. 18a). Additionally, using five independent
orthotopic tumors derived from our inducible Kras PDAC model4, we show that expression
of GOT1 increased and GLUD1 decreased in an oncogenic Kras-dependent manner in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 18b). These findings demonstrate that, in PDAC, oncogenic Kras plays
a critical role in coordinating the shift in Gln metabolism to maintain tumor growth and
survival.
We next assessed the sensitivity of PDAC cells to either AOA or EGCG upon Kras
knockdown using 8988T cells, a cell line that is not dependent on Kras for survival16.
Consistent with our previous results, AOA significantly inhibited clonogenic growth,
whereas EGCG had minimal effects. Interestingly, Kras knockdown made the cells

significantly more resistant to AOA and sensitive to EGCG (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig.
18c). To confirm the role of oncogenic Kras in the reprogramming of Gln metabolism, a
targeted metabolomic analysis using [U-13C5]-Gln was performed upon Kras knockdown.
Indeed, the changes observed were consistent with Kras-supporting the anabolic metabolism
of Gln, where multiple metabolites in the GOT1-dependent pathway were significantly
deregulated (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 19).

Author Manuscript

Given the importance of Gln metabolism in maintaining the redox state of PDAC, we
speculated that inhibition of anabolic Gln metabolism may sensitize PDAC to oxidative
stress. To test this concept, we inhibited Gln metabolism in PDAC cells using a GLS
inhibitor and examined whether this would synergize with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
treatment. Indeed, two chemically distinct GLS inhibitors8,17 had a growth suppressive
effect on both human and mouse PDAC cells (Supplementary Fig. 20a, b), consistent with
the GLS knockdown data (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, when combined with H2O2, this effect was
dramatically augmented, indicating that PDAC cells are markedly more sensitive to ROS
when Gln metabolism is impaired (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 20c). This finding may
have significant therapeutic implications, given that clinical grade GLS inhibitors are being
developed18 and that standard PDAC therapies (such as radiation) lead to the generation of
ROS. Moreover, since this aspect of Gln metabolism does not appear as critical in normal
cells, these data suggest an accessible therapeutic window.

Author Manuscript

Collectively, our data reveal a novel dependence on the transaminases GOT2 and GOT1 for
metabolism of the Gln carbon skeleton in PDAC. These reactions lead to the cytosolic
conversion of Asp into OAA, malate and then pyruvate and are required sustain PDAC
growth, likely through maintaining redox balance. Importantly, our work also demonstrates
that oncogenic Kras mediates this reprogramming of Gln metabolism (Fig. 4f). While this
pathway is critical for redox balance and cell growth in PDAC, it does not preclude the
involvement of other pathways that may contribute to redox balance such as glutathione
synthesis9,19,20 or an NRF2-dependent mechanism21. Furthermore, there may be cell-type
specific differences, as Kras-transformed fibroblasts require both GLUD1 and transaminases
for cell growth22. Lastly, these findings may have implications for future therapeutic
approaches as inhibition of Gln metabolism in PDAC can potentially synergize with
therapies that increase intracellular ROS such as chemotherapy and radiation.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Proliferation and clonogenic assays were performed as previously described23. To
characterize Gln metabolism, targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
was performed4. Briefly, cells were grown in complete media and transferred into Gln-free
media supplemented with [U-13C5]-Gln overnight (steady state) or for the indicated
timepoints (flux analyses). For subcutaneous xenografts, PDAC cells infected with lentivrial
shRNAs to suppress target gene expression were suspended in 100 µl HBSS and injected
subcutaneously into the lower flank of NCr nude mice. For mouse xenografts, murine PDAC
cells stably infected with a doxycycline-inducible GOT1 shRNA construct were injected.
Animals were fed with doxycycline water starting on the day of injection or when tumor

For subcutaneous xenografts, 8988T cells were infected with lentiviral shRNAs targeting
GLUD1 (n=2), GOT1 (n=2), MDH1 (n=2), ME1 (n=2) and GFP (control hairpin, n=1) and
subjected to a short puromycin selection (2 µg/mL); shRNA sequences below. 1.5×106 cells,
suspended in 100 µL Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS), were injected subcutaneously
into the lower flank of NCr nude mice (Taconic). Tumor length and width were measured
twice weekly and the volume was calculated according to the formula (length × width2)/2.
All xenograft experiments with human PDAC lines were approved by the HMS Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number 04–605. For mouse
xenografts, a doxycycline-inducible GOT1 shRNA construct was first generated. For
generation of the construct, oligonucleotides to mouse GOT1 shRNA (forward :

into the AgeI-EcoRI sites of the pLKO-Tet-on vector. For subcutaneous xenograft, 106
stably infected murine PDAC cells were suspended in 100 µl Hanks Buffered Saline
Solution and injected subcutaneously into the lower flank of NCr nude mice (Taconic).
Animals were fed with doxycycline water (doxycycline 2g/L, sucrose 20g/L) starting on the
day of injection or when tumor diameter reached 50mm. Tumor volumes were measured
every third day starting from day 4 post-injection and calculated as above. These xenograft
experiments were approved under MDACC IACUC protocol 111113931.
Western blot analysis

After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond-N Nitrocellulose (Amersham
Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% non-fat
dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), prior to incubation with the primary antibody
overnight at 4°. The membranes were then washed with TBS-T followed by exposure to the
appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1h and visualized on
Kodak X-ray film using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Thermo
Scientific). The following antibodies were used: Kras (F234, Santa Cruz), GOT1
(NBP1-54778, Novus), GLUD1 (ab55061, Abcam) and β-Actin (A2066, Sigma).
ROS Quantification

Author Manuscript

DCFDA assay was performed 24hr after supplementing Gln-free media with either OAA
(4mM) or dimethyl malate (4mM). Cells were incubated with 5µM 2’,7’dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, Invitrogen) for 30 min. Excess DCFDA was
removed by washing the cells twice with PBS, and labeled cells were then trypsinized,
rinsed, and resuspended in PBS. Oxidation of DCFDA to the highly fluorescent 2’,7’dichloro-fluorescein (DCF) is proportionate to ROS generation and was analyzed by flow
cytometry.

For steady state metabolomic analysis, PDAC cell lines were grown to ~50% confluence in
growth media (DMEM, 2 mM Gln, 10 mM glucose, 10% CCS) on 10 cm dishes in
biological quadruplicate. A complete media change was performed two hours prior to
metabolite collection. To trace Gln metabolism, PDAC cell lines were grown as above and
then transferred into Gln-free DMEM (with 10 mM glucose) containing 10% dialyzed FBS
and 2 mM [U-13C5]-Gln (Cambridge Isotope Labs) overnight (for steady state labeling) or
for the indicated timepoints in the flux analyses. Additionally, fresh media containing
[U-13C5]-Gln was exchanged 2 hr prior to metabolite extraction for steady state analyses.
The quantity of the metabolite fraction analyzed was adjusted to the corresponding protein
concentration calculated upon processing a parallel 10cm dish. Metabolite fractions were
collected and analyzed by targeted LC-MS/MS via selected reaction monitoring (SRM), as
described5,14. Processed data was analyzed in Cluster 3.0 and TreeViewer.

Measurement of Sensitization of PDAC cells to ROS
PDAC cell lines were plated into 96-well plates at 103 cells/well in 200 µL of growth media.
The following day, growth media was replaced with that containing GLS inhibitors and/or
H2O2. Parallel plates were analyzed at 3, 6 and 9 days by Cell Titer Glo analysis (Promega),
per the manufacturer’s instruction. The GLS inhibitors 968 (active) and 365 (structurally
similar, inactive) were provided as a kind gift from the Cerione laboratory9. BPTES was a

NADP+/NADPH ratios were determined using the NADP/NADPH assay kit (Abcam;
ab65349) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 105 cells (n=6 wells of a 6well dish) were collected on ice in extraction buffer and subject to two rounds of freezethaw at −80°C. NADP+ and NADPH values were determined in biological sextuplet and
concentration was obtained by comparison to standard curves. OAA was not analyzed by
targeted LC/MS-MS due to its limited stability in aqueous solvents at room temperature25.
As such, the abundance of this metabolite was determined using a quantification kit
(Biovision), according the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 2×106 cells (n=4 10cm
dishes) were collected during log-phase growth by trypsinization, re-suspended immediately
in the buffers provided (on ice), analyzed and compared to standard curves. The signals
obtained were normalized to the protein concentration calculated upon processing a parallel
10cm dish. NEAA mixture consisted of a mixture of 0.1 mM glycine, alanine, aspartate,
asparagine, proline and serine.
