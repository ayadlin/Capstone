BACKGROUND: Fareston (toremifene) and tamoxifen, both selective estrogen receptor modulators, are therapeutically equivalent treatments for metastatic breast cancer. We hypothesized that toremifene as compared with tamoxifen given as adjuvant therapy for early stage breast cancer would result in equivalent survival with an improved side
effect profile, therefore, providing superior therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: The North American Fareston versus Tamoxifen Adjuvant trial assigned 1813 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive invasive breast cancer to adjuvant treatment with either tamoxifen or toremifene. The primary outcomes
evaluated were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 59 months. The
baseline characteristics of the 2 treatment groups were well-balanced. On the basis of intent-to-treat, 5-year actuarial
DFS was not significantly different between tamoxifen and toremifene (91.2% [standard error of the mean [SE] 1.2%]
vs 91.2% [SE 1.1%], respectively). Similarly, 5-year actuarial OS was not significantly different between tamoxifen and
toremifene (92.7% [SE 1.1%] vs 93.7% [SE 1.0%], respectively). Controlling for patient age, tumor size, and tumor
grade, a Cox multivariate survival analysis found no difference between patients randomized to toremifene versus tamoxifen in terms of OS (OR ¼ 0.951; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.623-1.451, P ¼.951) or DFS (OR ¼ 1.037; 95% CI,
0.721-1.491, P ¼.846). Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy enjoyed excellent DFS and OS. No significant differences were found between treatment with either
tamoxifen or toremifene. Treatment of HR-positive patients with either tamoxifen or toremifene is appropriate. Cancer

KEYWORDS: toremifene, tamoxifen, breast cancer, selective estrogen-receptor modulator, survival.

Tamoxifen (multiple manufacturers), approved for pharmaceutical use in the United States in 1977, has proven
value in the treatment of patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. The use of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for 5 years has demonstrated benefit in terms of improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).1,2
Unfortunately, the use of tamoxifen has also been shown to increase the risk of developing several significant side effects,
namely, thromboembolic events, ocular changes, and endometrial carcinoma.1,2 Recently, several alternative hormonal
therapies have become available as adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.
Toremifene (Fareston, manufactured by Orion Corporation, Espoo, Finland), like tamoxifen, is a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that binds to estrogen receptors (ERs), exerting either estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects, depending on the end organ, dose, and duration of therapy.3 Previous studies indicate that
toremifene inhibits cell proliferation in both breast and endometrial tissues.4 Like tamoxifen, toremifene acts as an antiestrogen in breast tissue, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cells from entering mitosis in human breast cancer cells.5 In contrast, toremifene varies from tamoxifen in a single chloride ion addition on a side chain, resulting in differing metabolism
and a potentially more favorable toxicity profile.6
Findings from preclinical studies as well as early clinical experience raised concerns regarding long-term effects of
SERMs. In preclinical studies, tamoxifen has been shown to be far more genotoxic and carcinogenic than toremifene because

of the creation of DNA adducts and induction of hepatic
and endometrial cancers in the rat.6,7 Phase 2 trials of tamoxifen and toremifene in patients with metastatic breast
cancer confirmed the safety and efficacy of toremifene but
could not confirm the superiority of either SERM.8,9
From these results, the possibility was raised that
with continued follow-up, patients receiving toremifene,
as compared with tamoxifen, may experience equivalent
survival with significant improvements in toxicities.
Therefore, we hypothesized that toremifene may have
superior therapeutic efficacy in comparison with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for the American Joint Committee
on Cancer (AJCC) stage I and II breast cancer in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
From July 1998 through December 2002, women with
HR-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive toremifene (60 mg) or tamoxifen (20 mg) daily for 5 years in
the North American Fareston versus Tamoxifen Adjuvant
(NAFTA) trial. This investigator-initiated prospective
randomized controlled trial accrued patients from 93 academic and private centers throughout the United States.
The study design was approved by the internal review
board of each participating institution. Each patient was
provided with the information necessary to give consent
before registration and randomization.
Data collected at the time of enrollment included
demographics, pathology reports including hormone receptor status, operative reports, and plans for radiation
therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, if applicable. Institutional pathology reports were obtained and used to verify or obtain missing information as provided on clinician
data forms. To allow the finding of this study to be as pertinent as possible to patients seen in a variety of practice
settings, a central review of pathological tumor features
was not performed to confirm the results from individual
institutional pathology reports. In addition, the magnitude of our study and resource limitations would have
made the performance of a central pathology review prohibitive. Follow-up reports were collected during semiannual history and physical exams and included results of
annual mammograms and annual gynecologic exams.
Patient Selection
In considering eligibility, a decision was made to enroll a
cohort of patients similar to those commonly seen in com-

2308

munity practice to allow findings of the trial to be the
most clinically applicable. Therefore, patients were not
excluded because of advanced age or associated medical
comorbidities. Eligible patients included perimenopausal
or postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of AJCC
stage I or II HR-positive primary invasive breast cancer.
Patients were required to undergo definitive surgery for
the primary tumor as well as axillary lymph node staging
by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary
lymph node dissection (ALND) within 84 days before the
initiation of adjuvant systemic or radiation therapy. Hormonal and radiation therapies could be given
concomitantly.
At the time that the NAFTA trial was initiated in
1998, the standard of care for postmenopausal patients
with ER-positive breast cancers was adjuvant treatment
with tamoxifen only. Thus, patients considered for cytotoxic chemotherapy were not eligible for this study. As the
trial progressed, the standard of care evolved to include cytotoxic chemotherapy, in addition to hormonal therapy,
for a progressively greater number of high-risk patients.
After this change, there was a significant decrease in
patient accrual and there appeared to be considerable
selection bias, resulting in the enrollment of patients with
a better prognosis as well as older patients at higher risk
for complications from chemotherapy. Recognizing this
bias, the selection criteria were expanded in June 2002 to
include patients receiving chemotherapy. As a result, a
small number of patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy were enrolled in the later months of the trial.
The advent and institution of SLN staging as an acceptable method for axillary lymph node staging occurred
during this study. Results from this technique were determined to be at least as efficacious as ALND.10 Therefore,
the axillary nodal status of these patients was determined
by either ALND or SLNB.
To be eligible for hormonal therapy, patient tumors
had to express estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (PR)
as per institutional report. Positive receptors were defined
as those with 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein or determined
to be positive by immunohistochemistry as defined according to institutional standards. If one receptor was expressed,
patients were eligible, even if the status of the other receptor
was negative or unknown. Patients were ineligible if the status of both receptors were unknown.
Patients were ineligible if they had a prior history of
cancer other than curatively treated basal or squamous cell
carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ, or intraductal carcinoma or lobular carcinoma in situ (DCIS or

regarding the incidence of a previous diagnosis of DCIS
or LCIS in our patient population. Patients were also
ineligible if they had received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for this breast cancer or a prior
cancer.
Statistics
The primary outcomes evaluated were DFS, defined as the
time from registration to local and/or systemic recurrence,
and OS, defined as the time from registration until death
from any cause. The secondary endpoints were differences in
adverse events. This study was powered to determine
whether toremifene provides a DFS and OS equivalent to tamoxifen (<5% difference). The expected DFS for tamoxifen
at 5 years ranged from 86% to 91%. The use of tamoxifen in
patients similar to our study population was expected to
result in a 90% 5-year survival. The patient accrual size was
calculated to detect a 5% difference with 90% power and a
significance level of 5% with a 2-sided test.
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics
were reported using descriptive statistics. Univariate analyses were performed using Fisher exact test for dichotomous
variables, likelihood ratio for categorical variables with 3 or
more categories, and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. DFS and OS were compared using actuarial
analyses survival and Cox multivariate analyses.

although the tamoxifen group tended to be older (median
age, 68 vs 67 years, P ¼ .096), with larger tumors (median
tumor size, 1.3 cm vs 1.2 cm, P ¼ .086), of higher grade
(proportion grade 3, 18.3% vs 15.7%, P ¼ .081) (Tables

1 and 2). Only 15 patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy were enrolled in our trial.
Of the 1813 patients, 906 enrolled in the study and
completed all 5 years of hormonal therapy and follow-up
as assigned (Table 3). The reasons that patients did not
complete the study were evenly distributed between the
tamoxifen and toremifene groups. Because of the large
number of institutions involved in this study, many
patients had incomplete follow-up. These patients were
evenly distributed between the tamoxifen and toremifene
groups (41.7% vs 38.7%, respectively, P ¼ .394). It is
unfortunate that many attempts to collect this information did not result in a response.
Treatment Efficacy
On the basis of intent-to-treat, 5-year actuarial OS was
not significantly different between tamoxifen and toremifene (92.7% [standard error (SE) 1.1%] vs 93.7% [SE
1.0%], respectively). Similarly, 5-year actuarial DFS was
not significantly different between tamoxifen and toremifene (91.2% [SE 1.2%] vs 91.2% [SE 1.1%], respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves also show very
similar outcomes (Fig. 1). Controlling for patient age, tumor size, and tumor grade, a Cox multivariate survival
analysis showed no difference between patients randomized to toremifene versus tamoxifen in terms of OS (odds
ratio [OR] ¼ 0.951; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6231.451, P ¼ .951) or DFS (OR ¼ 1.037; 95% CI, 0.7211.491, P ¼ .846). Excluding the patients who experienced
a protocol violation or otherwise never started the study
drug, survival times were again similar between the tamoxifen and toremifene groups (5-year actuarial OS,
92.8% [SE 1.1%] vs 93.8% [SE 1.0%], respectively; 5year actuarial DFS, 91.3% [SE 1.1%] vs 91.3% [SE
1.1%], respectively). Cox proportional hazards models for
OS (P ¼ .951) and DFS (P ¼ .843) failed to demonstrate
a significant difference between the 2 treatment arms in
the per-protocol analysis.

to either the tamoxifen or toremifene study arm of the North
American Fareston versus Tamoxifen Adjuvant trial on the

months.

Recurrences and Deaths
Of the patients enrolled in this study, 48 (2.6%) women
experienced breast cancer recurrence during the mean follow-up period of 59 months. Of these patients, 22 (2.4%)
of those taking tamoxifen and 26 (2.9%) of those taking
toremifene had a local, regional, distant, or multiple site
recurrence (Table 4). There were no statistically significant differences in recurrence by anatomic site between
the 2 groups. Seventy-four (4.1%) of the women died
during the study period; 40 (4.4%) of the women had
been assigned to the tamoxifen group and 34 (3.8%) to
the toremifene group (Table 3). Of those women who
died during the study period, 21 (28%) of the deaths were
attributed to breast cancer, 11 (28%) of the women had
been assigned to the tamoxifen group and 10 (29%) to the
toremifene group.
Adverse Events
Our study shows a trend toward similar rates of thromboembolic, gynecologic, and ocular events in the women
treated with tamoxifen or toremifene (Table 5). Although

fever and/or chills in the tamoxifen as compared with toremifene group (n ¼ 44 vs 25, respectively, P ¼ .03), there
was no significant difference in the number of women
experiencing night sweats in those taking tamoxifen as
compared with toremifene (n ¼ 143 vs 165, respectively,
P ¼ .08). Fever and chills were the only side effects where
the comparison of occurrence between the 2 groups
reached statistical significance.

DISCUSSION
This multicenter trial was designed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant treatment with either tamoxifen (20 mg) or toremifene (60 mg) for 5 years in
perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with early
stage HR-positive breast cancer expressing ER and/or PR.
This is the only North American, large-scale trial comparing these SERMs in early stage breast cancer. The primary
indicators of treatment efficacy evaluated were 5-year
DFS and OS. Toxicity profiles were assessed as secondary
indicators.
Although tamoxifen is associated with substantial
response rates in women with hormone dependent breast
cancer, it is associated with several undesirable side effects.
Preclinical and early clinical data indicated that toremifene, a chlorinated derivative of tamoxifen, may be associated with fewer detrimental side effects while maintaining
the therapeutic benefits of tamoxifen.6,11
Our study found that for early stage HR-positive
breast cancer, treatment with tamoxifen and toremifene
were not therapeutically different. At a mean follow-up of
59 months, there was no difference in DFS, OS, or recurrence between the 2 groups enrolled in the NAFTA trial.

In analyzing patterns of recurrence, we noted a
higher number of local recurrences as well as distant bone
recurrences in women taking toremifene (Table 4). However, these results were not statistically significant. Similarly, the Finnish Breast Cancer Group, in a study
comparing the safety and efficacy of tamoxifen (20 mg)
and toremifene (40 mg) given for 3 years to postmenopausal patients with axillary lymph node-positive breast
cancer, did not find a difference in the number of locoregional, distant, or total recurrences.12 The various sites of
distant recurrence were not specified.12 Women enrolled
in the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG)
trials 12-93 and 14-93, comparing toremifene (60 mg)
with tamoxifen (20 mg) given to perimenopausal and

lymph node-positive breast cancer, had similar rates of
DFS.13 Statistics comparing the sites of first failure were

We must address the finding that a high proportion
of the enrolled patients did not complete treatment or follow-up. We believe that this was because of the large number of centers involved in patient accrual, many of whom
were unable to provide the necessary follow-up. This was
an unfortunate result of our attempt to accrue patients
from a large number of clinical settings, including many
that did not have clinical research staff to assist in data collection and submission. This high rate of attrition may
have introduced bias into the results of our study. Potentially, those who completed the study and follow-up experienced better results because of their diligence and that of
their health providers as evidenced by their completion of
the study. It is also possible that patients who did not
complete follow-up had intolerable side effects from their
medication and chose not to continue or return for further
care.
In addition, we must consider the impact of the
large number of patients with incomplete follow-up on
the ability of the study to discriminate between the outcomes of these groups of women. Without a doubt, this
affected the power of the study. However, equivalent
patients were lost from each group and we performed
analyses using an intent-to-treat approach, which helped

2312

to correct for these losses. In addition, our results are consistent with previous studies, which evaluated the efficacy
and safety of toremifene and tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy in women with advanced and local breast cancer.
Hayes et al, in a comparison of tamoxifen (20 mg)
and toremifene (60 mg or 200 mg) as therapy for HRpositive or HR-unknown metastatic breast cancer, found
that patients treated with these SERMs experienced median OS rates of 31.2 months, 37.6 months, and 29.7
months, respectively.8 These differences were not statistically significant. The ‘‘Nordic’’ phase 3 study randomized
postmenopausal patients with ER-positive or ERunknown advanced breast cancer to treatment with tamoxifen (40 mg) or toremifene (60 mg). In the ‘‘Nordic’’
study median OS time for patients treated with toremifene was 33.0 months and 38.7 months for those treated
with tamoxifen (P ¼ .65).14 Milla-Santos et al compared
tamoxifen (40 mg) with toremifene (60 mg) in postmenopausal patients with advanced ER-positive breast cancer.
The median survival was 15.4 months in those taking toremifene and 12.3 months in those taking tamoxifen
(P ¼ .20).15
Two previous studies were also performed to evaluate tamoxifen and toremifene as adjuvant therapy in
patients with axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer.
The Finnish Breast Cancer Group found that the mean
time to breast cancer recurrence (23.5 and 21.6 months,
respectively, P ¼ .38) and 5-year OS (65.6% and 70.3%,
respectively, P ¼ .15) were similar in both groups.12
Results from the IBCSG trials 12-93 and 14-93 demonstrated 5-year DFS rates of 76% and 76% (P ¼ .42) and
5-year OS rates of 90% and 86% (P ¼ .73), respectively,
in the ER-positive cohort.13
The most impressive discovery of our trial was the
excellent outcome of these patients as evidenced by a low
incidence of recurrence and death. To put this into perspective, we compared our results to those obtained by the
Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group
(EBCTCG). This group performed a meta-analysis of
37,000 patients with early breast cancer enrolled in 55
randomized trials that began before 1990 comparing tamoxifen to no tamoxifen therapy (Table 6).16 The cohort
of patients from this trial that were compared with the
patients in our study includes the 3738 women who were
ER-positive or ER-unknown and received tamoxifen therapy for a median duration of 5 years.16
DFS is invariably shorter than OS in breast cancer
trials. When OS is shorter than DFS this implies that
deaths are occurring because of causes other than breast

cancer. In the NAFTA trial, DFS and OS were nearly
equivalent, suggesting that many of the deaths resulted
from diseases other than breast cancer and were confirmed
by study data showing that only 28% of all deaths were
due to breast cancer. This is not an unrealistic result
because of the advanced age of many of the patients enrolled in our study. Similar results were also seen in the
EBCTCG study when patient outcomes were stratified by
age. For patients younger than 60 years of age, recurrence
as first event occurred more frequently than mortality
from any cause. As patient age increased, mortality from
any cause occurred more frequently than recurrence as
first event. Recurrence as first event and mortality from
any cause in patients aged 60-69 years were 21.4% and
23.5%, respectively, and in patients ages 70 and older
were 25.8% and 45.7%, respectively.16 Thus, in both the
EBCTCG study and the NAFTA trial, death in older
patients (especially those 70 years) was frequently due to
causes unrelated to breast cancer, resulting in disproportionate mortality when compared with recurrence.
One factor contributing to the impressive survival
seen in our trial, when compared with the outcomes of the
EBCTCG study, was nodal status. Ninety percent of the
patients enrolled in the NAFTA trial and 70% of those
reviewed in the EBCTCG study were axillary lymph
node-negative. In addition, the institution of the SLNB
for axillary evaluation occurred during the years when
patients were accrued to the NAFTA trial. Because of the
thoroughness by which sentinel nodes are examined, they
are much more likely to reveal micrometastases.17 Patients
identified as having positive nodes by SLNB, who by
ALND may have been classified as lymph node-negative,
are classified at a higher stage. Such patients are more
likely to receive chemotherapy, making them ineligible
for the NAFTA trial and creating a selection bias. In addition, by identifying those patients with axillary lymph
node micrometastases (specifically those who by ALND
would likely have been classified as lymph node-negative),

the prognoses of those patients classified as lymph nodenegative or lymph node-positive are improved. Upstaging
patients with micrometastases detected by SLNB
improves the prognosis of the lymph node-negative population. Also, a portion of patients determined to be lymph
node-positive by SLNB have less axillary lymph node tumor burden than what is likely to be detected after ALND
and, therefore, lymph node-positive patients as a group
have a better prognosis. This phenomenon is more commonly referred to as the ‘‘Will Rogers’’ effect.
Further selection bias was induced by the initial
accrual of patients who were to be treated with hormonal
therapy only, likely improving the overall outcomes of
those patients enrolled in NAFTA. Expanding indications
for chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for the postmenopausal HR-positive population emerged during the
enrollment period for NAFTA (1998-2002). Some of
those patients who would have been enrolled at the outset
of the trial began receiving chemotherapy creating a bias
toward the accrual of older patients with potentially less
virulent cancers than those enrolled in previous studies.
Finally, those enrolled were judged, on the basis of expert
clinical opinion, to have a better prognosis and though
unlikely to benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy.
The result of these factors was accrual of patients
into the NAFTA trial of whom an overwhelming majority
were postmenopausal and axillary lymph node-negative
(as increasingly diagnosed by SLNB) with a significantly
better prognosis than was anticipated when the trial was
initially proposed in 1996. Accordingly, these patients,
regardless of treatment arm, experienced fewer recurrences, fewer deaths, and superior outcomes.
In our study there were no differences in the
reported rates of serious thromboembolic events between
the 2 groups. Results from previous studies reveal similar
results (Table 7). Although there is some discrepancy in
the rates of the occurrence of these toxicities between these
studies, this likely stems from variances in how the events

2313

Original Article

were defined, interpreted, and reported. For example,
some of these studies appeared to collect data on all events
while others collected only ‘‘severe’’ events or those
defined as grade 3 or 4 toxicities. After review, and in the
context of our own clinical trial, the authors if this article
conclude that these data point toward a similar incidence
of thromboembolic events among patients taking either
tamoxifen or toremifene.
In our trial, there was no difference between those
taking toremifene or tamoxifen in the occurrence of endometrial cancer. The Finnish Breast Cancer Group
reported no significant differences in the occurrence of
second cancers, including endometrial cancer which
occurred in 2 patients in tamoxifen group and no patients
in the toremifene group, in their study.12 In the IBCSG
trials, with a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 8 patients
were diagnosed with endometrial cancer: 6 in the toremifene group and 2 in the tamoxifen group.13 Collectively,
these trials, do not suggest a difference between the 2
SERMs in the occurrence of endometrial cancer as an
apparent infrequent event in the first decade of follow-up.
Visual disturbances and retinal changes have been
rarely associated with the use of tamoxifen.18 The diagnoses of retinopathy and cataracts and requirement for cataract surgery were similar in patients taking tamoxifen and
toremifene (Table 5). Patients receiving either of these
SERMs should be carefully monitored for these events.
Vasomotor symptoms are among the most frequently reported side effects in patients receiving SERMs
and were commonly reported in our study as
well.8,12,14,15,19 Fever and chills occurred in more patients
randomized to tamoxifen compared with those taking toremifene (n ¼ 44 vs 25, respectively, P ¼ .03). Inexplicably, there was a trend toward experiencing night sweats in
those taking toremifene compared with those taking tamoxifen (n ¼ 165 vs 143, respectively, P ¼ .08). This
apparent difference may have been because of the patient’s
subjective recall of symptoms in the months before each
visit.
We would be remiss not to discuss the role of these
SERMs in the current era of aromatase inhibitors.
Unfortunately, this study predates the widespread use of
aromatase inhibitors and we do not have data for comparison of these 3 hormonal therapies. However, recent studies have provided evidence that aromatase inhibitors as
compared with tamoxifen improve the disease free interval of patients with HR-positive breast cancer, yet both
groups experience an equivalent overall survival.20,21 And
although the role of SERMs in the management of breast

2314

cancer has decreased in recent years, they continue to be
clinically efficacious, especially for those with an intolerance of or contraindication to aromatase inhibitors.
Although there has only been limited use of toremifene in the treatment of breast cancer, especially because
the advent of aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen remains the
only hormonal therapy available for HR-positive premenopausal patients. Recent data suggest that patients
with certain polymorphisms of the P450 CYP2D6 gene
or those who take medications that inhibit this gene may
have decreased metabolism of tamoxifen to its more
potent metabolites.22,23 These patients may then have
worse outcomes.24 Although the metabolites of toremifene are known, we are unaware of any data regarding the
particular enzymes involved in its metabolism other than
P450 CYP3A4.25,26 Although it is quite possible that
P450 CYP2D6 is also involved in the metabolism of toremifene to its most active metabolites as well, this is an area
worth attention. If, in fact, a different pathway is involved,
toremifene would be a very acceptable alternative for those
with genetic polymorphisms that reduce their ability to
metabolize tamoxifen and for those who are unable to
find an alternative medication that does not interfere with
their metabolism of tamoxifen.
In conclusion, our study provides further evidence
that toremifene is a safe and efficacious alternative to tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of perimenopausal and
postmenopausal, HR-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen
and toremifene both produce excellent outcomes and may
continue to be used as adjuvant therapy, especially in
older patients with early stage HR-positive breast cancer.
In addition, because of slight differences in the side effect
profiles of these SERMs, one may consider a trial of the alternative drug if severity of side effects necessitates an
alteration in therapy.
