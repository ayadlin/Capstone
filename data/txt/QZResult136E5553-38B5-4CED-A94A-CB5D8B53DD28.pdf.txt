Azacytidine Inhibits RNA Methylation at DNMT2 Target Sites
in Human Cancer Cell Lines

The cytosine analogues azacytidine and decitabine are
currently being developed as drugs for epigenetic cancer
therapy. Although various studies have shown that both drugs
are effective in inhibiting DNA methylation, it has also become
clear that their mode of action is not limited to DNA
demethylation. Because azacytidine is a ribonucleoside, the
primary target of this drug may be cellular RNA rather than
DNA. We have now analyzed the possibility that azacytidine
inhibits the RNA methyltransferase DNMT2. We found that
DNMT2 is variably expressed in human cancer cell lines.
RNA bisulfite sequencing showed that azacytidine, but not
decitabine, inhibits cytosine 38 methylation of tRNAAsp, a
major substrate of DNMT2. Azacytidine caused a substantially
stronger effect than decitabine on the metabolic rate of all
the cancer cell lines tested, consistent with an effect of
this drug on RNA metabolism. Of note, drug-induced loss of
RNA methylation seemed specific for DNMT2 target sites
because we did not observe any significant demethylation at
sites known to be methylated by other RNA methyltransferases. Our results uncover a novel and quantifiable drug
activity of azacytidine and raise the possibility that tRNA
hypomethylation might contribute to patient responses.

and that are generally considered to play a major role in the
establishment of methylation patterns. It has been shown that
DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B can be effectively depleted by
azanucleosides (11). The mechanism of inhibition is widely assumed
to depend on the incorporation of the fraudulent azacytosine base
into DNA, followed by covalent trapping and subsequent degradation of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. As a consequence, DNA
will become passively demethylated when cells continue to replicate
in the presence of reduced levels of DNA methyltransferase.
Despite the progress that has been made in characterizing the
DNA demethylation responses of azacytidine and decitabine,
numerous studies have indicated that the mode of action of these
drugs is not limited to DNA methylation inhibition (3). In this
context, it is particularly noteworthy that the effects of the
ribonucleoside azacytidine on the RNA methyltransferase activity
of the DNMT2 enzyme have not yet been investigated. DNMT2
contains all the catalytic signature motifs of conventional
(cytosine-5) DNA methyltransferases, but has comparably low
DNA methyltransferase activity (12). More recently, it was shown
that DNMT2 methylates tRNAAsp (13), which suggested that the
substrate specificity of the enzyme might be different from other
DNMTs. We have now analyzed the molecular effects of azacytidine
in human cancer cell lines and found that the drug inhibits RNA
methylation at DNMT2 target sites.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

The pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methylation plays an
important role in the treatment of human cancers (1, 2).
5-Azacytidine (azacytidine) and the closely related compound
2¶-deoxy-5-azacytidine (decitabine) are cytosine analogues that have
been established as potent inhibitors of DNA methylation, both in
preclinical models and in cancer patients (3). Both drugs have shown
significant clinical benefits in a variety of clinical trials (4, 5) and have
received Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment
of myelodysplastic syndrome, a preleukemic bone marrow disorder.
It has also been shown in various studies that azacytidine and
decitabine induce DNA demethylation in myelodysplastic syndrome
patients (6–9), but DNA methylation biomarkers for the predicition
of clinical patient responses remain to be established (3).
The human genome contains four DNA methyltransferase genes
(10). DNMT1 is the major biochemical activity in protein extracts
from various tissues and has been designated as the maintenance
methyltransferase for the postreplicative maintenance of DNA
methylation patterns. DNMT3A and DNMT3B are two closely
related enzymes that have been termed de novo methyltransferases

Cell culture. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium
supplemented with 10% FCS. HL-60, K562, and ML-1 cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% L-glutamine, 10% FCS, 100 U/mL
penicillin G sodium, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin sulfate. Cells were treated
with azacytidine (Sigma) or decitabine (Calbiochem), as indicated.
Dnmt2 expression analysis. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy RNA
Isolation kit (Qiagen) and on-column DNA digestion was performed using
the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). For quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR), 5 Ag of RNA were reverse transcribed using Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Each cDNA sample was analyzed in triplicate using the QuantiFast SYBR
Green PCR kit (Qiagen). QuantiTect Primer Assays (Qiagen) were used for
DNMT1 (Hs_DNMT1_1_SG, QT00034335) and DNMT2 (Hs_TRDMT1_1_SG,
QT00049896). The housekeeping gene GAPDH was amplified using the
primers GAPDH_fwd (ATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTC) and GAPDH_rev
(TCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATGGT). Using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a reference, relative quantification was performed
using the E-method of the LightCycler 480 software (Roche). Primer specific
efficiencies were calculated from serial cDNA dilutions using the second
derivative maximum method.
For protein expression analysis, 50 Ag of protein extracts were separated
on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by immunoblotting on
nitrocellulose and visualization using an anti-DNMT2 antibody (Santa
Cruz SC-20702, 1:1000). For RNAi experiments, knockdown of DNMT2
was performed using On-Target plus SMART pool siRNA (Dharmacon).
On-Target plus siControl nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon) was used as a
control. Cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L siRNA using DharmaFect

manufacturer’s instructions.
tRNA bisulfite sequencing. RNA bisulfite sequencing of tRNAAsp was
performed as described previously (14), with the following modifications:
tRNAAsp was reverse transcribed using either the reverse transcription stemloop primer 5¶-CTCAACTGGTGTCGTGGAGTCGGCAATTCAGTTGAGTGGCTCCCCA-3¶ (tRNA sequence indicated in italics) or random hexamers. cDNA
was PCR amplified using the bisulfite primers 5¶-TAGTATAGTGGTGAGTATT3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CGGCAATTCAGTTGAG-3¶ (reverse for stem loop primed)
or 5¶-CTCCCCATCAAAAAATTA-3¶ (reverse for hexamer primed). 28S rRNA
methylation was analyzed using the reverse transcription primer
5¶-ATCTAAACCCAACTCACA-3¶ and the bisulfite primers 5¶-TTTTAAGTAGGAGGTGTT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-ATCTAAACCCAACTCACA-3¶ (reverse). For
454 sequencing, bisulfite sequence–specific PCR amplicons were gel purified
and reamplified using primer pairs containing 454 linker sequences.
Metabolic activity assay. Cells were seeded into multiwell plates.
Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were treated with various concentrations of azacytidine and decitabine, respectively, for 24 h. Metabolic activity
was determined by the CellTiter-Blue assay (Promega) for HCT116 cells and
by the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega) for HL-60, K562, and ML-1 cells. Assays
were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Standard
curves for dose response analysis were plotted in SigmaPlot, version 10.0
(Systat Software) using the four-parameter logistic function. Functions were
plotted only when metabolic activity was reduced sufficiently to meet the ‘‘s’’
shape criterion for the concentration range used in this assay.
DNA methylation analysis. Genomic DNA was purified using the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). Global methylation levels were
determined by capillary electrophoresis, as described previously (15).

Results
The cytidine analogue azacytidine has found increasing use for the
clinical treatment of myeloid leukemias (2). Although it is generally
assumed that azacytidine acts through covalent trapping of DNMT
enzymes and inhibition of DNA methylation, the mode of action of
this drug is not clearly understood (3). Two previous studies have
suggested that azacytidine also affects tRNA methylation (16, 17), but
these observations have never been followed up in detail. However,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

these findings, together with the observation that DNMT2 catalyzes
the methylation of tRNAAsp (8), raised the possibility that DNMT2
might be inhibited by azacytidine.
The relevance of DNMT2 for tumorigenesis has not been
investigated yet. DNMT2 mutant mice do not display obvious mutant
phenotypes (8) and have not been tested for their tumor
susceptibility. Because mouse DNMT2 has been shown to be
predominantly expressed in testis (18), we needed to establish
DNMT2 expression in human cancer cell lines. As an initial step, we
used quantitative RT-PCR to determine DNMT2 mRNA expression in
HCT116 colon carcinoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The results
showed that DNMT2 mRNA is expressed in both cell lines, but at
lower levels than DNA methyltransferase 1 (Fig. 1A). We also analyzed
DNMT2 protein levels by Western analysis of protein extracts from
HCT116 cells using DNMT2-specific antibodies. This revealed a
polypeptide of f40 kDa that could be effectively depleted after
transfection of the cells with siRNAs directed against DNMT2, thus
confirming the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 1B). DNMT2 protein
expression levels were subsequently analyzed in a panel of human
cancer cell lines representing different tumor entities and different
tissues of origin. The results showed variable DNMT2 protein
expression in these cell lines (Fig. 1C), with comparably high levels in
K562 and MCF7 cells and very low levels in A549 and HepG2 cells.
A previous study has established cytosine 38 (C38) of tRNAAsp
(Fig. 2A) as the primary substrate of DNMT2 in various model
systems (13). To determine the tRNAAsp methylation pattern in
HCT116 cells, we used RNA bisulfite sequencing (14). Sequencing of
11 independent clones from control HCT116 cells showed that
tRNAAsp was methylated at C38, C48, and C49 (Fig. 2B). When cells
were transfected with control siRNAs, this methylation pattern was
not significantly affected (Fig. 2B). Sequencing of 14 independent
clones from HCT116 cells that had been transfected with siRNAs
directed against DNMT2 showed a complete loss of methylation at
C38 (Fig. 2C), consistent with the notion that C38 is methylated by
DNMT2 (13). Interestingly, the results also indicated reduced levels

Inhibition of tRNA Methylation by Azacytidine

of methylation at C48 (Fig. 2C), a residue that has been considered
to be methylated by the TRM4 family of tRNA methyltransferases
(19). This finding raises the possibility that DNMT2 can also
methylate C48 in tRNAAsp, or that the methylation at this position
is indirectly influenced by the methylation at C38. In contrast, C49
methylation, which is catalysed by the TRM4 family of proteins
(19), was not affected in cells lacking DNMT2 (Fig. 2C). Our results
thus confirm a role of DNMT2 in the site-specific methylation of
tRNAAsp in human cancer cells.
In subsequent experiments, we used the same methodology to test
for effects of azacytidine on tRNAAsp methylation. When HCT116
cells were treated with 1 Amol/L azacytidine for 1 day, methylation of
C38 was considerably reduced, whereas methylation of C49 seemed
unchanged (Fig. 2D). Of note, parallel treatment with 1 Amol/L
decitabine did not cause loss of methylation in tRNAAsp (Fig. 2D),
and the difference in C38 methylation between the azacytidine- and
decitabine-treated samples was statistically significant (P = 0.038,
Fisher’s Exact test). This indicates that the ribonucleoside azacytidine is more effective in inhibiting C38 methylation of tRNAAsp than
the deoxyribonucleoside decitabine.
Azacytidine and decitabine are widely considered to have similar
modes of action. However, differences in the cellular effects of
these drugs have also been shown (20). tRNA methylation is
generally assumed to regulate tRNA functionality and thereby
influences the metabolic activity of cells. The selective inhibition of
tRNA methylation by azacytidine thus raised the possibility that
azacytidine and decitabine might also show differential effects on

the metabolic activity of human cancer cell lines. We therefore
treated HCT116 cells with various concentrations of azacytidine or
decitabine for 24 hours and determined the metabolic activity of
the cells. The results showed that azacytidine caused a distinct
drug response at low micromolar concentrations, whereas
decitabine showed a similar effect only at 50-fold higher
concentrations (Fig. 3). We also performed metabolic activity
assays in a set of three cell lines (HL-60, K562, and ML-1)
representing myeloid leukemias, the most frequent indication for
the clinical use of azacytidine. All three cell lines showed a clear
response to azacytidine, and a substantially weaker response to
decitabine (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the differential
tRNA methylation inhibition activities of azacytidine and decitabine and suggest that inhibition of RNA methylation might be an
important aspect in the cellular response to azacytidine.
Having shown that azacytidine affects the metabolic activity of
myeloid leukemia cells, we also sought to confirm azacytidinemediated demethylation of tRNAAsp in these cell lines. Bisulfite
sequencing of tRNAAsp from control K562 cells showed a
methylation pattern that was similar to control HCT116 cells,
with methylation at C38, C48, and C49 (Fig. 4A). Treatment with
1 Amol/L azacytidine for 3 days caused significant (P < 0.001,
Fisher’s Exact test) demethylation at C38 and also at C48 (Fig. 4A).
To confirm this observation in an additional myeloid leukemia cell
line and to analyze the specificity of azacytidine-induced
demethylation in greater detail, we used 454 technology to
sequence tRNAAsp and 28S rRNA in HL-60 cells. This approach

hundred sequence reads revealed that tRNAAsp from HL-60 cells
was methylated at C38, C48, and C49 (Fig. 4C), in agreement with

the methylation pattern observed in other cell lines. Treatment
with 500 nmol/L azacytidine for 3 days caused substantial
demethylation of C38. Similar effects were also observed at C48,

Inhibition of tRNA Methylation by Azacytidine

siRNA-mediated knockdown of DNMT2 in HCT116 cells. In contrast,
C49 methylation, which is mediated by the TRM4 family of proteins
(19), was not affected by azacytidine (Fig. 4C). Similarly, C4417 of 28S
rRNA, which is methylated by a member of the p120/SUN family
of RNA methyltransferases (19), did not show any azacytidinedependent methylation changes (Fig. 4C). This demethylation
pattern is consistent with a selective inhibition of DNMT2 activity.
To further characterize azacytidine-mediated loss of tRNA
methylation, we also compared tRNA demethylation and DNA
demethylation dose responses. To this end, HL-60 cells were
treated for 3 days with various concentrations of azacytidine and
C38 methylation levels of tRNAAsp were determined by the analysis
of 100 to 600 sequence reads per data point. In parallel analyses,
genomic cytosine methylation levels were determined by capillary
electrophoresis. The results confirmed a concentration-dependent
demethylation of C38 from 54% in untreated control cells to 21% in
cells treated with 500 nmol/L azacytidine (Fig. 5A). At higher drug
concentrations, C38 methylation levels were similar to control
levels (Fig. 5A). It is possible that higher drug concentrations cause
a general inhibition of the RNA metabolism and a reduction in the
synthesis of new and unmodified tRNA molecules. In contrast to
the clearly defined concentration optimum for tRNAAsp demethylation at 500 nmol/L, significant DNA demethylation could only be
observed at the highest test concentration (1 Amol/L; Fig. 5A), thus

indicating that tRNAAsp is more sensitive to azacytidine-induced
demethylation than DNA.
We also analyzed how repeated 3-day treatment cycles with low
concentrations (200 nmol/L) of azacytidine affect tRNAAsp
methylation. C38 demethylation was readily detectable after the
first treatment cycle (Fig. 5B). This effect was lost after the third
treatment cycle, when methylation levels were similar to control
levels (Fig. 5B). When we used capillary electrophoresis to
determine genomic DNA methylation levels under the same
conditions, we did not observe any significant DNA demethylation,
even after three treatment cycles (Fig. 5B). These findings further
illustrate the sensitivity of tRNAAsp methylation to azacytidine and
establish (de)methylation of tRNAAsp as a novel molecular biomarker
for azacytidine responses in human cancer cell lines. The reasons
for the inability of azacytidine to demethylate tRNAAsp after repeated
drug incubation are presently unclear and will have to be investigated in future studies. It is possible that repeated doses of low
azacytidine concentrations cause a general inhibition of the RNA
metabolism, comparable with the effects observed after a single dose
with high drug concentrations.

Discussion
The role of the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A,
and DNMT3B in tumorigenesis has been extensively analyzed (21).

In contrast, there are no published studies on the role of the fourth
member of this family, DNMT2, in human cancers. DNMT2 has
been shown to have a prominent tRNA methyltransferase activity
in various model systems (13), which separates this enzyme from
other DNMT proteins. In addition, this finding also raises the
possibility that altered DNMT2 activity might contribute to
tumorigenesis through novel pathways that are related to RNA
methylation. Although the precise function of DNMT2-mediated
RNA methylation remains to be established, tRNA methylation has
been implied in the regulation of tRNA folding and stability (22, 23).
It is conceivable that misfolded and/or less stable tRNAs
might impact the rate of protein synthesis in cancer cells.
Our recent analysis of tRNA methylation patterns in DNMT2
mutant Drosophila melanogaster has uncovered additional
enzyme substrates,1 which suggests that the translation of several
codons might be affected by the inhibition of DNMT2-mediated
methylation.
Azacytidine has found widespread laboratory use as an inhibitor
of DNA methylation and our results show that the drug can also
inhibit cytosine methylation in tRNAAsp with considerable
specificity. Our bisulfite sequencing results revealed efficient
demethylation of tRNAAsp at C38 and at C48, thus establishing
two sites as biomarkers for monitoring DNMT2 function during or
after azacytidine treatment. Other methylated cytosines, such as
C49 of tRNAAsp, and C4417 of 28S rRNA, which are methylated by
other RNA methyltransferases, were only weakly affected by
azacytidine. The use of a DNA methyltransferase-like mechanism
for the methylation of tRNA substrates (24) might provide an
explanation for the particular sensitivity of DNMT2 to azacytidine.
Because our study only analyzed a limited number of RNA
methylation sites, we cannot exclude the possibility that other RNA
methyltransferases are also inhibited by azacytidine. The detection

of such effects might also have been obscured by general drug
effects on RNA metabolism, thus resulting in a reduced
representation of newly synthesized RNA molecules. In this
scenario, the bisulfite sequencing approach would only allow us
to recover RNA molecules that had been synthesized and
methylated before drug treatment.
Regardless of the precise mechanism of tRNA methylation
inhibition, our results may prove to be useful for the clinical
development of azacytidine. Over the past few years, azacytidine,
and its deoxynucleoside variant, decitabine, have been developed
as archetypal drugs for epigenetic cancer therapy (25). Both drugs
have shown to be similarly effective in inducing DNA demethylation in cancer cell lines and in patients (6–9, 20), which has
fostered the notion that the mode(s) of action of both drugs are
highly similar. Our results indicate that azacytidine is more
effective than decitabine in inhibiting tRNA methylation, and thus
provide an important example for a cellular pathway that is
selectively affected by one of the drugs. In addition, our results
also suggest that azacytidine-induced tRNA demethylation can be
detected with higher sensitivity than azacytidine-induced DNA
demethylation. It will be important to characterize the effects of
azacytidine on RNA methylation patterns in patients undergoing
azacytidine therapy and to evaluate RNA methylation markers for
their potential as molecular markers predicting clinical responses.
