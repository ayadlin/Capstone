ABSTRACT
Calcineurin (Cn) is a calcium activated protein phosphatase involved in many
aspects of normal T cell physiology, however the role of Cn and/or its downstream
targets in leukemogenesis are still ill-defined. In order to identify putative
downstream targets/effectors involved in the pro-oncogenic activity of Cn in T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) we used tandem affinity chromatography,
followed by mass spectrometry to purify novel Cn-interacting partners. We found
the Cn-interacting proteins to be part of numerous cellular signaling pathways
including eIF2 signaling and mTOR signaling. Coherently, modulation of Cn activity
in T-ALL cells determined alterations in the phosphorylation status of key molecules
implicated in protein translation such as eIF-2α and ribosomal protein S6. Joint
targeting of PI3K-mTOR, eIF-2α and 14-3-3 signaling pathways with Cn unveiled
novel synergistic pro-apoptotic drug combinations. Further analysis disclosed that
the synergistic interaction between PI3K-mTOR and Cn inhibitors was prevalently
due to AKT inhibition. Finally, we showed that the synergistic pro-apoptotic response
determined by jointly targeting AKT and Cn pathways was linked to down-modulation
of key anti-apoptotic proteins including Mcl-1, Claspin and XIAP. In conclusion, we
identify AKT inhibition as a novel promising drug combination to potentiate the proapoptotic effects of Cn inhibitors.

including the TALL1/2, LMO1/2, TLX1/3 and HOXA
families, associated with distinct stages of differentiation
arrest [3-5].
Calcineurin (PPP3; PP2B referred to as Cn) is a
calcium-activated serine/threonine (S/T) phosphatase,
composed of a catalytic subunit (PPP3CA) and a
regulatory subunit (PPP3CB), critical to a number of
developmental processes in the cardiovascular, nervous,
and immune system. Cn has the ability to dephosphorylate
a broad range of proteins, including Nuclear Factor of
Activated T cells (NFAT) proteins. Although critically

INTRODUCTION
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
accounts for approximately 15% of pediatric and 25%
of adult cases of ALL. Progress in T-ALL therapy has
been impressive, with cure rates approaching 80% for
children and 50% for adults [1, 2], however only limited
therapeutic options are available for patients with primary
resistant or relapsed disease. T-ALL is classified into
subgroups based on exclusive genetic alterations and/or
deregulated expression of specific transcription factors,

involved in many aspects of normal T cell survival,
proliferation and activation, the direct implication of Cn
and/or its downstream NFAT targets in lymphomagenesis
and cancer in general has only recently been reported [6,
7]. Available evidence shows that NFAT transcription
factors are mediators of Cn action in different cancers
[8-10]. However, it is possible that NFAT factors are
not the only targets of Cn in leukemogenesis, as Cn
can dephosphorylate other factors possibly relevant to
its oncogenic properties. With this perspective in mind,
we used tandem affinity chromatography, followed by
mass spectrometry (MS) to purify novel Cn-interacting
partners in human T-ALL cells. We found a large set of
proteins associated with Cn, including transcriptional
regulators and protein modifiers which fell into numerous
canonical signaling pathways. In this study, we explored
the potential therapeutic importance of the functional
interaction between the top signaling pathways enriched
in our PPP3CA complex and the canonical Cn-NFAT
signaling pathway.

PPP3CA interactors such as NPM1, BCL11b, GSK3β
and KDM1 (also known as LSD1). Amongst the most
prominent functional categories identified by Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) were proteins involved in apoptosis signaling,
transcriptional regulation/repression and signaling
crosstalk (Supplementary Table S1). Similarly, functional
classification using PANTHER bio-informatics tool
identified numerous functional categories to be enriched
in the protein list including chaperone activity, binding
activity, transcriptional regulator activity and enzyme
regulator activity (Supplementary Figure S1). STRING
program was also used to generate a protein interaction
network from our identified PPP3CA interacting proteins
integrating interaction data from numerous sources
including genomic context, high-throughput experiments,
co-expression experiments and previous knowledge from
the literature (Supplementary Figure S1).

Validation of novel identified PPP3CA
interacting proteins

RESULTS

To validate our results, proteins belonging to the
major DAVID functional annotation clusters identified
and distributed relatively homogeneously in our ordered
protein list (Supplementary Table S1) were cloned and
tested in co-transfection experiments. In these experiments
HEK 293T cells were transfected with constitutively
active PPP3CA* and each of the putative interacting
proteins belonging to the following functional categories:
cytoskeletal remodeling (KIF11), regulation of trafficking
(FLNA), signaling crosstalk (GSK3β), nucleotide binding
(hnRNPU, STK38), transcriptional regulation (PRMT5,
IFI16, BCL11b), ATP binding (PKM2), apoptosis
signaling (NPM1, PRDX1), DNA replication (RPA2,
RBBP4), trafficking (HSPA8), RNA splicing (FUS),
nucleic acid transport (KHSRP) and protein biosynthesis
(DNAJA2). In all, after immunoprecipitation (IP), we
confirmed 15 of the 17 tested putative interacting proteins
to be able to interact with PPP3CA (>90%; Figure 2).
Some of the PPP3CA interactor proteins implicated in
leukemia pathobiology such as BCL11b, NPM1, GSK3β
and Rb were further validated in Jurkat T-ALL cells
expressing constitutively active PPP3CA* (Figure 3A). To
study whether some of these interactions were also present
in T-ALL cells under endogenous conditions, we lysed
Jurkat T-ALL cells and executed IP against PPP3CA and
subsequently immunoblotted against BCL11b, Rb, MCM4 and GSK3β (Figure 3B). In addition, to explore further
the functional relevance of the interactions we executed
IP following treatment with ionomycin (IONO; to activate
Cn/NFAT signaling), Cyclosporin A (CsA; to inactivate
Cn/NFAT signaling) or vehicle control for 1h, in order
to modulate Cn activity. We found that the interaction
between PPP3CA and BCL11b, Rb and GSK3β present
under basal conditions was further increased following

Identification of PPP3CA–associated binding
partners in T-ALL cells
To identify novel factors that support the putative
oncogenic function of Cn in T-ALL, we purified
activated PPP3CA from Jurkat T-ALL cells. To this end,
we generated Jurkat cells stably expressing a human
constitutively active PPP3CA mutant (PPP3CA*) tagged
with both FLAG and HA epitopes (F/H-PPP3CA*). This
mutant lacks both the calmodulin binding domain and
auto-inhibitory domains and is constitutively active [11]
even in the absence of elevated calcium (Figure 1A).
Immunoblot analysis showed that tagged PPP3CA* is
expressed at a level comparable to endogenous PPP3CA
(Figure 1B). Importantly, F/H-PPP3CA* expressing cells
had higher levels of NFATc2 and dephosphorylated (fast
migrating in SDS/PAGE) forms of NFATc2 compared to
empty vector-expressing control cells (Figure 1B). F/HPPP3CA* and its associated partners were purified from
total cell lysates derived from Jurkat cells using tandem
affinity chromatography (Figure 1C). Mass spectrometry
analysis identified 139 protein-partners of PPP3CA*
(Figure 1D and Supplementary Table S1). Importantly,
numerous
well-characterized
PPP3CA-interacting
proteins were identified in our complex (Figure 1D and
Supplementary Table S1), including PPP3R1, RCAN1
and 3, PPP3CB, CABIN1 and IQGAP1 [12]. Interaction
network analysis of PPP3CA*-associated proteins
revealed several functional classes of proteins including
proteins with transcriptional regulatory activity, enzyme
regulatory activity and translational regulatory activity
(Figure 1D). Interestingly, several proteins implicated
in leukemia pathobiology emerged amongst the novel

On the other hand, CsA treatment did not significantly

pathways are shown in Figure 4A, and included eIF2
signaling, cell cycle control, mammalian target of
Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and 14-3-3 mediated
signaling. The complete list of canonical signaling pathways
enriched in our protein list is show in Supplementary
Table S2. Within this list several well-known pathways
associated with NFAT-Cn function such as role of NFAT in
regulation of the immune system, role of NFAT in cardiac
hypertrophy, calcium signaling and calcium-induced T
lymphocyte apoptosis were significantly enriched (Figure
4A). To explore the functional relevance of these findings,
we performed experiments to determine the effects of
Cn-NFAT signaling activation and inhibition on eIF2/
p70S6K and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. To
this end, Jurkat T-ALL cells were treated for different

times with the combination ionomycin and the phorbol
ester PMA (Phorbol myristate acetate; IONO+PMA; to
induce optimal Cn-NFAT activation). As shown in Figure
4B, Cn activation determined a moderate increase in
phosphorylated AKT (phospho-AKT; S473) and phosphoeIF2α (S51), while no significant modulation of phosphomTOR (S2448) was found. In addition, Cn activation
determined a significant increase in phospho-S6K (T389),
phospho-S6RP (S235/236) and phospho-eIF4E (S209),
especially at early time points (Figure 4C). Phosphorylation
of eIF2α is implicated in inhibition of eIF2B activity,
while phosphorylation of eIF4 and S6RP are indicative
of increased protein synthesis, thus it appears that the
relationship between Cn activation and protein synthesis is
rather complex. Possibly, acute activation of Cn may lead
to a transient increase in mRNA translation and protein
synthesis, while prolonged Cn activation ultimately results
in a decrease in protein synthesis. Activation of Cn by

ionomycin alone (Figure 4D) also determined an increase
in phospho-AKT (S473), phospho-eIF2α (S51), phosphoS6K (T389) and phospho-S6RP (S235/236), while it was
ineffective in inducing phospho-eIF4E (S209). On the other
hand, Cn inhibition by CsA had a mixed effect (Figure 4D)
as it also increased phospho-AKT (S473), phospho-eIF2α
(S51), while it reduced phospho-S6K (T389) and phosphoS6RP (S235/236). All together, these results indicate that
Cn activity can significantly modulate signaling pathways
implicated in mRNA translation and protein synthesis.

be essential for the ability of T-ALL leukemic cells to
long-term propagate the disease in serial transplantation
assays [15]. Since several of the signaling pathways
found enriched in our complex are aberrantly activated
or deregulated in T-ALL and pharmacological inhibitors
to some of the enriched canonical pathways exist, we
evaluated whether a functional interaction between the top
signaling pathways enriched in our PPP3CA complex and
the canonical PPP3CA-NFAT signaling pathway existed.

Thus, we evaluated whether pharmacological inhibition
of the pathways: (i) cell cycle control (using the panCDK inhibitor, Roscovitine), (ii) mTOR signaling (using
the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235), (iii) eIF2 signaling
(using the eIF2α inhibitor, Salubrinal) and (iv) 14-3-3
signaling (using BV-02) could be potentially exploited
therapeutically in T-ALL in combination with Cn
inhibitors such as CsA and/or other Cn specific inhibitors
such as CN585 [16] or FK-506. To this end, Jurkat T-ALL

cells were treated with increasing concentrations of each
of the afore mentioned pathway inhibitors (Roscovitine,
BEZ235, Salubrinal or BV-02) or vehicle in combination
with the Cn inhibitor, CsA and evaluated for loss of
viability. Analysis of drug interactions using the medianeffect method of Chou and Talay [17] to calculate the
combination index (CI), disclosed predominantly a
synergistic anti-leukemic effect in the combination
CsA and Salubrinal, BV-02 and BEZ235 [CI<1] at
multiple concentrations (Figure 5B and 5C). Of these,
the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 demonstrated the
highest synergistic cytotoxic effect in combination with
CsA. Given the prominent role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway in T-ALL pathogenesis, this drug
combination was pursued further. Enhanced cytoxic effect
of the combination BEZ235 and CsA was confirmed in
at least two other T-ALL cell lines (CCRF-CEM and
MOLT-3; Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure S2) and
three primary T-ALL xenografts (T-ALL#12, T-ALL#15
and T-ALL#19; Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure S2).
Similar results were obtained using other Cn inhibitors
such as CN585 or FK-506 (Figure 5F and 5G and
Supplementary Figure S2).

the same combination treatment consisting of the AKT
inhibitor MK-2206 and a Cn inhibitor (CsA/CN585/FK506) showed an enhanced apoptotic response and loss of
viability with the combination treatment compared to each
single drug only (Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure
S3).
We also evaluated the effects of these drugs on
activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs;
where CD3+ T cells comprised 40-70% of cell population,
data not shown). PBMCs were isolated from normal
donors and treated with different concentrations of the
Cn inhibitors (CsA, FK-506 and CN585) or PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway inhibitors BEZ235 and MK-2206,
before being evaluated for apoptosis induction. We found
that PBMCs remained highly viable even at very high
concentrations (Supplementary Figure S4). In addition,
combination treatments between MK-2206 and Cn
inhibitors showed a very modest increase in the apoptotic
effects (compared to single drug treatments) even at high
drug concentrations, suggesting a favourable therapeutic
index (Supplementary Figure S4).

The synergistic anti-leukemic effect of combined
PI3K-mTOR pathway and Cn inhibition is
mainly due to inhibition of AKT

The anti-leukemic effect of joint inhibition of
AKT and Cn is mediated through the downregulation of multiple anti-apoptotic proteins
including Mcl-1, Claspin and X-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis protein (XIAP)

In 50-75% of T-ALL patients, PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway is constitutively active and negatively
affects patient outcome [18]. To try and dissect the level
at which PI3K/mTOR inhibition synergizes with Cn
inhibition, we make use of selective inhibitors for key
components of the pathway (Figure 6A). We thus treated
Jurkat T-ALL cells with increasing doses of drugs targeting
mTOR (AZD8055), PI3K (CAL-101), AKT (MK-2206),
p70 S6 Kinase (PF-4708671) and SGK (GSK650394)
alone or in combination with CsA. Analysis of drug
interactions using the CI, disclosed that AKT inhibition
by MK-2206 was the most effective in synergizing with
the Cn inhibitor CsA (Figure 6B and 6C). Interestingly,
the cytotoxic effect of joint AKT and Cn inhibition was
superior to that obtained with BEZ235. Given these
results, we proceeded in testing the novel combination
MK-2206 and CsA in additional T-ALL cell lines and
xenografts. To this end, T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat, CCRFCEM and MOLT-3) were treated with vehicle, MK-2206,
CsA or the combination MK-2206 plus CsA and evaluated
for apoptosis induction and loss of viability after 48-72h.
Consistent with our previous findings, all T-ALL cell lines
tested showed an enhanced apoptotic response and loss
of viability with the combination treatment compared to
each single drug only (Figure 6D and 6E). Similar results
were obtained when other Cn inhibitors (CN585 or FK506) were substituted for CsA (Supplementary Figure
S3). Analogously, primary T-ALL xenografts treated with

To assess which survival factors were responsible
for the strong anti-leukemic effects of the combination
treatment MK-2206 and CsA, we used antibody-based
apoptosis arrays. To this end, Jurkat cells were treated
for 24h with vehicle, MK-2206, CsA or the combination
MK-2206 plus CsA. Cell lysates were then hybridized to
human apoptosis arrays, which allow the simultaneous
detection of 35 apoptosis-related proteins. In Jurkat cells,
the combination treatment MK-2206 and CsA determined
a strong induction of cleaved Caspase 3, which was
associated with a strong reduction in numerous antiapoptotic proteins including survivin, Claspin and Bcl-2
(Figure 7A). Some of the most differentially regulated
anti-apoptotic proteins in our arrays (survivin and Claspin)
and three addition apoptosis related proteins either not
present in the arrays (Mcl-1, Bim) or whose expression
could not be reliably determined (XIAP) were investigated
by IB in independent samples (Figure 7B). We found that
the combination treatment MK-2206 plus CsA determined
a marked decrease in the expression of Claspin, Mcl-1
and an increase in Bim isoforms in Jurkat T-ALL cells.
XIAP and survivin levels were also decreased compared
to vehicle control. Further analysis in two other T-ALL
cell lines (CCRF-CEM and MOLT-3; Figure 7C and
Supplementary Figure S5) and three primary samples
(Figure 7D and Supplementary Figure S5) disclosed that
Mcl-1 and Claspin were consistently down-regulated in all
cases, while XIAP down-regulation was less consistent.

DISCUSSION

promotes cytotoxicity in T-ALL cells through the downregulation of key anti-apoptotic proteins including Mcl1, Claspin and XIAP. Of these, Mcl-1 down-regulation
emerged as the most preserved mechanism across T-ALL
cell lines and xenografts. Mcl-1 is a critical mediator of
cell survival, especially of hematopoietic cells [26], and
its expression is regulated through complex mechanisms
at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [27].
It is likely that Mcl-1 protein reduction following joint
Cn and AKT inhibition is due to at least two mechanisms
including phosphorylated eIF2α inhibition of Mcl-1
mRNA translation [28, 29] and increased ubiquitindependent proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 protein
through augmented GSK3 dependent phosphorylation of
Mcl-1 [30, 31].
The PI3K/AKT as well as mTOR pathways are two
interconnected signaling pathways affecting numerous
cellular functions, including metabolism, growth and
survival [32, 33]. In 50-75% of T-ALL patients, this
pathway is constitutively active and negatively affects
patient outcome [18].
MK-2206 is a novel, orally active, allosteric AKT
inhibitor, which is under development for the treatment of
solid tumors. MK-2206 is a potent and selective inhibitor
for AKT, whose efficacy has been proven in preclinical
models of human cancer [34, 35]. In T-ALL, MK-2206
has been shown to be cytotoxic to T-ALL cell lines and to
possibly target a cell subset enriched in leukemia initiating
cells (LICs) in primary T-ALL samples [36]. In addition,
AKT inhibition by MK-2206 has been shown to be able
to reverse glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL [37]. Thus,
MK2206 has entered numerous phase I/II clinical trials for
treating solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia.
It is believed that difficulty in eradicating tumors
could result from conventional treatments targeting the
bulk of tumor cells, but not the putative Cancer Stem Cells
(CSCs) or LICs, thus strategies aimed at eliminating these
cells could have significant clinical implications. MK2206 has been shown to be able to markedly reduce the
CD34+/CD7−/CD4− T-ALL subset [36], which has been
reported to be enriched in LICs, in addition leukemiainitiating cell activity has been shown to require Cn
in T-ALL [15]. Thus, it could be expected that joint
pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR together
with Cn inhibition in T-ALL could effectively deplete
putative LICs contributing to improved clinical response
and reduced risk of relapse.
In conclusion, our study has uncovered novel
signaling pathways which interact with the Cn-NFAT
signaling pathway in T-ALL cells including eIF2
signaling and p70 S6K/mTOR signaling. Interestingly,
we demonstrate an enhanced anti-leukemic effect of
combination strategies involving joint inhibition of AKT
with Cn inhibition. Hopefully, the identification of novel
interactions between canonical pathways deregulated
in T-ALL for which clinically relevant inhibitors are

Using an unbiased proteomic approach to identify
proteins possibly relevant to the oncogenic properties of
Cn in T-ALL, we identified novel and known PPP3CAinteracting proteins implicated in numerous cellular
signaling pathways, including eIF2 signaling, cell cycle
control, mTOR signaling and 14-3-3 mediated signaling.
Importantly, several proteins implicated in leukemia
pathobiology emerged amongst the novel PPP3CA
interactors such as Rb, NPM1, BCL11b, GSK3β and
KDM1 (also known as LSD1). Of these, GSK3β has been
described to interact with Cn in neuron-derived cells [19]
and recently reported by us to interact with PPP3CA in
T-ALL cells [13]. Future studies will need to be conducted
to evaluate the significance of these additional interactions.
Calcium signaling (and thus Cn-NFAT signaling)
has been linked to numerous aspects of tumorigenesis,
influencing motility, angiogenesis, genotoxicity, gene
transcription, telomerase activity, differentiation, cell cycle
progression and apoptosis [20]. Interestingly, from our
proteomics analysis we identified protein synthesis and
translational regulation as the most significantly enriched
canonical pathways associated with our PPP3CAbinding proteins. Protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells
is a complex process that requires cooperation among a
large number of factors and comprises different phases
(initiation, elongation and termination). Regulation of
translation initiation is the main control point for mRNA
translation. mTOR regulates translation initiation altering
the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K), which
phosphorylates 40S ribosomal protein S6 (S6RP), and
by phosphorylating the eukaryotic initiation factor
4E-binding protein 4E-BP1. Translation initiation can
also be regulated through the phosphorylation of eIF2α
on S51, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis [2125]. We found that modulation of Cn activity had a
mixed effect on key players involved in protein synthesis
and translation regulation. In fact, optimal activation of
Cn activity determined an early and transient (within
6h from stimulation) increase of phospho-p70 S6K,
phospho-eIF4E and phospho-S6RP indicative of
increased protein synthesis and mRNA translation, while
eIF2α phosphorylation prevailed at late time points (24h
from stimulation). On the other hand, inhibition of Cn
activity was consistently associated with increased eIF2α
phosphorylation and decreased phosphorylation of p70
S6K and S6RP.
By inhibiting pathways enriched in our PPP3CA
protein complex we identified the dual PI3K-mTOR
inhibitor BEZ235 as a promising drug in synergizing
with Cn inhibitors to promote T-ALL cell death. Further
studies to dissect the key element/s of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway whose inhibition synergize best with Cn
inhibitors, identified AKT as the key component to inhibit.
Mechanistically, we find that joint AKT and Cn inhibition

Transfection and immunoprecipitation

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were
transfected with expression vectors encoding pcDNA3-F/
H-PPP3CA* and each of the expression vectors encoding
the novel PPP3CA interacting partners (RBBP4, hnRNPU,
KHSRP, IFI-16, FLNa, RPA2, FUS, ARG1, STK38,
PRDX1, DNAJA2, GSK3β, HSPA8, KIF-11, PRMT5,
BCL11b and NPM1) using JetPEI transfection reagent
(Polypus-transfection Inc., NY, USA). Fourty hours after
transfection, cells were lysed in CO-IP buffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40
and protease inhibitors). For IP, cell lysates were incubated
with anti-HA or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads (SigmaAldrich) overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed five times
with lysis buffer and proteins were eluted by incubating
the beads with HA peptide (1mg/ml, Roche) or FLAG
peptide (1mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) or boiled in 5X SDSLaemmli’s sample buffer. Immune complexes were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. For His-tagged
proteins, transfected cells were lysed in TEN buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1%
NP-40, 10 mM Imidazole, 10% Glycerol) supplemented
with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated with
HisPur Cobalt resin (Pierce) overnight at 4°C. Beads were
washed three times with lysis buffer and proteins were
eluted by incubating the beads with 300 mM Imidazole
elution buffer. Immune complexes were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and WB. For IP of endogenous PPP3CA
bound proteins in T-ALL cells, we lysed 100-150×106
T-ALL cells for 30 min in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented
with phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails. After
centrifugation, the cell lysates (diluted 1:3 with CO-IP
buffer) were pre-cleared with TrueBlot® anti-Mouse Ig IP
Beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) before being
incubated overnight with 5 μg of mouse antibody against
PPP3CA (BD Pharmingen, Oxford, U.K.) or irrelevant
mouse Ig (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg,
Germany). Subsequently, samples were incubated for 2h
with TrueBlot® anti-Mouse Ig IP Beads and IP washed 5
times with CO-IP buffer. Immune complexes were then
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot.

Affinity purification mass spectrometry and
bioinformatics
For the purification of Cn-associated proteins, 12
x 109 Jurkat cells stably expressing FLAG-HA tagged
PPP3CA* constitutively active mutant (F/H PPP3CA*)
and control Jurkat cells were harvested by centrifugation,
washed in cold PBS and resuspended in CO-IP lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.1% NP-40) supplemented with phosphatase and
protease inhibitor cocktails. The lysate was cleared by
centrifugation at 13.000 g for 30 min. Whole cell extracts
were incubated for 16 h (at 4°C with rotation) with antiFLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis,
MO, USA) (1% v/v) equilibrated in BC100 (20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA).
Beads were washed 3 times with BC100 containing 0.3%
Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted with 4
bead volumes of BC100 containing 0.5 mg/mL of FLAG
peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h. The FLAG affinity
purified complexes were further immunopurified by using
30 μL of anti-HA conjugated beads (Sigma-Aldrich). After
incubation for 16 h, HA beads were washed 4 times with
BC-100 containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in spin columns
(Pierce, Pero, Italy) and eluted under native conditions
using HA peptide (Roche, Burgess Hill, U.K.). Ten
percent of the eluate was resolved on SDS-PAGE and
silver stained using the silverquest kit (Invitrogen, Paisley,
U.K.). The remaining material was TCA precipitated and
subsequently analysed by MS at the Taplin Biological
Mass Spectrometry facility (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA). After compiling and filtering the data
(proteins represented by at least three unique peptides,
and proteins that were not present in the control IP),
the protein list was queried on the DAVID functional
annotation clustering platform to identify protein complex
functions [38]. With medium stringency threshold and
redundancy checking, 17 annotation clusters were finally
generated to represent biological functions enriched by
PPP3CA-interacting proteins. Protein interaction networks
were created with Cytoscape 2.7.0 [39]. The filtered list
was also run on PANTHER and STRING (Search Tool
for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) software.

mice. Primary T-ALL cells from xenografted mice were
cultured in vitro in MEM-alpha media supplemented with
10% human serum and cytokines [40] or RPMI-1640
media supplemented with 20% FBS for the duration of
functional assays (48 h). Peripheral blood samples from
healthy donors were collected using heparinized tubes and
processed by Ficoll (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Milan,
Italy) density gradient centrifugation to isolate PBMCs.
Cells were plated 1x106/mL per well in complete medium
and stimulated with a mixture of anti-CD3 (OKT3; 10μg/
mL) and 50 ng/mL human recombinant IL-2 (Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, New Jersey) to induce proliferation. Drugs
were added to PBMCs for 48 h before evaluation of
apoptosis induction.

FLAG tagged PPP3CA (F-PPP3CA; nt 1-1566),
constitutively active FLAG-tagged PPP3CA mutant
lacking the calmodulin binding and autoinhibitory
domains (F-PPP3CA*; nt 1-1170), double tagged FLAG/
HA PPP3CA* mutant (F/H-PPP3CA*), KIF-11, PRMT5,
BCL11b and NPM1 expression vectors (in pcDNA3
backbone) were generated by standard cloning procedures.
Expression constructs for RBBP4, hnRNPU, KHSRP, IFI16, FLNa, RPA2, PKM2, FUS, ARG1, STK38, PRDX1,
DNAJA2, GSK3β and HSPA8 were from Addgene.
The retroviral vector (MigR1tomato-F/H PPP3CA*),
expressing the red fluorescent protein Tomato and F/HPPP3CA* was generated by subcloning F/H-PPP3CA*
from pcDNA3-F/H-PPP3CA* into the MigR1tomato vector
using BglII and XhoI restriction sites.

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Total cell lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis
buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
set I and II (Sigma-Aldrich) and protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets (Roche) and normalized for protein concentration
using the BCA method (Pierce). For Western blotting,
protein samples were separated on 4-12% gradient TrisGlycine or 3-8% Tris-Acetate SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen)
and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Watford,
U.K.). Antibodies against c-myc (9E10), NFATc2 and
Claspin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies
recognizing GSK3β, PPP3CA, β-actin, MCM-4, FLAG
epitope, GST, phospho-mTOR (S2448), mTOR, phosphoAKT (S473), AKT, phospho-eIF2α (S51), eIF2α, phosphoeIF4E (S209), phospho-p70 S6K (T389), XIAP, Mcl1, survivin, Claspin, Bim, phospho-S6RP (S235/236)
and p70 S6K, were from Cell Signaling Technologies
(Danvers, MA, USA); HA epitope antibody was from
Roche; mouse anti-human Rb protein (BD Pharmingen),
rabbit anti-BCL11b (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montomery,
USA); mouse FLAG epitope antibody (M2), NFATc2
antibody (HPA 008789) were from Sigma-Aldrich; V5
tag antibody (E10/V4RR) was from Thermo Scientific
(Waltham, MA, USA) and Green Fluorescent Protein
antibody (A11122) was from Invitrogen.

Retroviral constructs and viral production
Retroviral particles were generated according to
standard protocols.

Cell viability assays and flow cytometry
Cell viability in T-ALL cell lines was analyzed
via the bioluminescent method Vialight plus (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) after 72 h. This assay allows
bioluminescent detection of cellular ATP as a measure
of viability. Measurement of ATP is the most accurate,
effective, and direct way of determining the number
of living cells in culture. We also analyzed apoptosis
after 48-72 h by flow cytometry (FACS) after staining
with Annexin V-FITC (Roche) and SYTOX Red dead
cell stain (Invitrogen). The samples were collected on a
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy) using Cell
Quest software (BD Biosciences), and analysed with
FlowJo (Tree Star).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t-test
and Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical tests were two
sided and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. We
analyzed drug synergism using the median-effect method
of Chou and Talay [17] and used the CalcuSyn software
(Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) to calculate the combination index
(CI). CI values below 1, equal to 1, and above 1.1 represent
synergism, additivity, and antagonism, respectively.

Human apoptosis array
We analysed the expression profiles of 35 apoptosisrelated proteins on cellular extracts using the Human
Apoptosis Array (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA).
Approximately 150 μg of cell lysates were incubated
overnight with the Human Apoptosis Array. The BioRad
ChemiDoc XRS Imager was used to capture the signals
from the arrays. The density of each spot was quantified
by Quantity One software (BioRad). Raw signal intensities
in each array were taken average across duplicate spots
for each probe and negative control probe (PBS) was
subtracted. Then processed data were expressed relative to
DMSO control and heat map generated using GenePattern
[41].
