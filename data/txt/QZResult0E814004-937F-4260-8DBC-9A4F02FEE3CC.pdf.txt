Abstract
Thyroid hormone (T3) signaling through the thyroid hormone receptor (TRa1) regulates hepatoma cell growth
and pathophysiology, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear at present. Here, we have shown that the
oncomir microRNA-21 (miR-21) is activated by T3 through a native T3 response element in the primary miR-21
promoter. Overexpression of miR-21 promoted hepatoma cell migration and invasion, similar to that observed
with T3 stimulation in hepatoma cells. In addition, anti-miR-21–induced suppression of cell migration was
rescued by T3. The Rac-controlled regulator of invasion and metastasis, T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis
1 (TIAM1), was identiﬁed as a miR-21 target additionally downregulated by T3. Attenuation and overexpression of
miR-21 induced upregulation and downregulation of TIAM1, respectively. TIAM1 attenuation, in turn, enhanced
migration and invasion via the upregulation of b-catenin, vimentin, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in hepatoma
cells. Notably, correlations between TRa1, miR-21, and TIAM1 expression patterns in animal models paralleled
those observed in vitro. In the clinic, we observed a positive correlation (P ¼ 0.005) between the tumor/nontumor
ratios of TRa1 and miR-21 expression, whereas a negative correlation (P ¼ 0.019) was seen between miR-21 and
TIAM1 expression in patients with hepatoma. Our ﬁndings collectively indicate that miR-21 stimulation by T3 and
subsequent TIAM1 suppression promotes hepatoma cell migration and invasion. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2505–17.

Introduction
The thyroid hormone (T3) is an important regulator of
growth, development, and differentiation in vertebrates. T3
binds to thyroid hormone receptors that belong to the nuclear
receptor superfamily. Human thyroid hormone receptors are
encoded by TRa and TRb genes located on chromosomes 17
and 3, respectively. The 2 genes yield several polypeptides via
alternative splicing and differential promoter usage. The TRa1,
TRb1, and TRb2 genes encoding functional products have been
well characterized. Accumulating evidence supports a critical
role of thyroid hormone receptors in carcinogenesis. For
instance, aberrant expression of thyroid hormone receptor

has been associated with human cancers (1). Earlier studies
suggest that partial loss of normal thyroid hormone receptor
function occurs due to reduced expression or complete loss of
activity resulting in mutations and/or aberrant expression,
which in turn, provides an opportunity for tumor cells to
proliferate, invade, and metastasize (2).
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small approximately 22-nucleotide
RNA molecules that modulate gene expression via the RNA
interference (RNAi) pathway. MiRNAs generally exhibit partial
complementarity, and often bind within the 30 untranslated
region (30 UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to translational
repression and/or degradation (3). Inappropriate expression
of miRNAs is strongly associated with carcinogenesis, as the
genomic aberrations observed in cancers directly reﬂect
miRNA expression patterns. Moreover, increasing evidence
shows that miRNA gene expression is dysregulated in human
cancers (4, 5). Speciﬁc over- or underexpression of miRNA is
correlated with particular tumor types (6, 7). To date, a number
of miRNAs that seem to function as tumor suppressors or
oncogenes have been identiﬁed.
A number of earlier studies have reported that T3/thyroid
hormone receptor signaling plays a critical role in hepatoma
(8–10). In addition, miRNAs play a fundamental role in regulating gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. Therefore,
to clarify the functions of speciﬁc transcription factors, miRNAs can be evaluated as potential targets. In hepatoma, miRNA
expression is frequently dysregulated, and speciﬁc miRNAs
have been shown to regulate migration and invasion (11). It is

speculated that miRNAs are critical downstream targets of
thyroid hormone receptors that participate in hepatoma cell
progression. To identify the speciﬁc miRNA targets of thyroid
hormone receptor, 270 miRNA expression proﬁles in HepG2–
TRa1 cells were obtained in the presence or absence of T3
using stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis. Consequently, several miRNAs up- or
downregulated upon T3 stimulation were detected. We ultimately focused on miR-21, one of the T3-modulated miRNAs
that is dysregulated in various cancers. Direct regulation of
miR-21 by T3 was conﬁrmed, and the mechanism underlying
the effects of T3 on hepatoma cell migration further
investigated.

Materials and Methods
qRT-PCR for miRNA and mRNA
The qRT-PCR method for detection of mature miRNAs and
mRNAs was conducted as described previously (10, 12).
Cell culture and transfection
The human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B, SK-Hep1
(obtained from American Type Culture Collection), and J7 (gift
from Dr. C.S Yang, National Taiwan University, Taiwan; ref. 13)
were routinely grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. The cell lines have
recently been authenticated using the StemElite ID System
(Promega). TRa1- and TRb1–overexpressing cell lines were
cultured, as described previously (14). The serum was depleted
of T3 (Td) using an earlier procedure (15). Cells were cultured at
37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.
Patients and statistical methods
To determine the associations among TRa1, miR-21, and
TIAM1 in hepatoma, total RNAs of tumor and adjacent nontumor liver tissues from 40 patients with hepatoma (13 females
and 27 males) from the Taiwan Liver Cancer Network were
obtained for analysis. The basic clinical characterization of the
40 patients is presented in Supplementary Table S1. The study
protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics and Human
Clinical Trial Committee of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (IRB No. 98-0798B).
Stable transfection of Hep3B cells with TIAM1
knockdown
RNAi against TIAM1 (obtained from Academia Sinica in
Taiwan), pLKO.1-shTIAM1, was used to deplete endogenous
TIAM1 in Hep3B cells. Speciﬁcally, the Hep3B cells were
transfected with pLKO.1-shTIAM1 using Turbofect (Fermentas). Transfected cells were incubated and selected in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS containing 0.3 mg/mL puromycin
for at least 2 weeks until colonies could be picked.
Ampliﬁed chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was conducted as described in a previous report (8). The upstream T3
response element (TRE) region of the pri-miR-21 gene was
ampliﬁed with the forward primer, 50 -AGAGGGCGGGCAGTTTCTT-30 , starting at nucleotide 1017, and reverse

primer, 50 -AATAAGGAAATGACTTATGC-30 , starting at nucleotide 958.
Immunoblot analysis
Proteins were loaded on a 6% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel for electrophoresis before transfer to a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane (PerkinElmer). The membrane was
blotted with antibodies speciﬁc for thyroid hormone receptor
protein (C4; ref. 16), TIAM1 (Calbiochem), vimentin, b-catenin, phospho-b-catenin (Santa Cruz), c-myc (GeneTex), cyclin
D1, c-Jun (Epitomics), b-actin, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Chemicon) for detection.
Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody, and developed using an ECL detection
kit (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblot assays were conducted
independently at least 3 times. The intensities of the immunoreactive bands were quantiﬁed using Image Gauge software
(Fuji Film).
30 UTR luciferase reporter assay
Full-length TIAM1 (1950 nt) or MSH2 (272 nt) 30 UTR (Supplementary Fig. S1) was synthesized and cloned into the pMIRREPORT vector (Applied Biosystems) containing the luciferase
reporter gene (TIAM1 or MSH2 30 UTR wt). The putative miR-21
recognition sites in TIAM1 or MSH2 30 UTR were subjected to
site-directed mutagenesis (TIAM1 or MSH2 30 UTR mut), and
the mutated sequences were validated via automated DNA
sequencing. The pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP and pmiRZip
lentivector (SBI System Biosciences) was used to express premiR-21 and antisense miR-21 small RNA, respectively. To
determine the effects of miR-21 on TIAM1 30 UTR, pMIRTIAM1-30 UTR and pre-miR-21, anti-miR-21 or negative control
vector were cotransfected into HepG2 cells using TurboFect.
Similarly, HepG2 cells cotransfected with pMIR-MSH2-30 UTR
and pre-miR-21 or negative control vector were examined. To
determine the effects of T3 on TIAM1 30 UTR, HepG2–TRa1
cells precultured in Td medium were transfected with pMIRTIAM1-30 UTR (wt) in the presence or absence of T3. After
transfection for 24 hours, cells were extracted for detection of
luciferase activity.
Migration and invasion assay
Cells (5  104/200 mL) in serum-free DMEM were seeded
onto the top chambers of Transwell ﬁlter devices and DMEM
containing 10% FBS added to the bottom chambers, as
described previously (14).
Gelatin zymography
An aliquot of concentrated medium (20 mg) from Hep3B–
shNeo and Hep3B–shTIAM1 cell cultures was loaded onto a
10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin, as described previously (17).
Animal model
In Model I, male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to
thyroidectomy (Tx) at 6 weeks of age according to a previous
method, with a view to examining the association between T3
/thyroid hormone receptor and miR-21 in vivo (10). To

Regulation of miR-21 by Thyroid Hormone Receptor

investigate the correlation between T3/thyroid hormone
receptor and miR-21 in T3-enhanced metastasis of hepatoma
cells in vivo, J7-TRa1 xenografts of eu-, hypo-, and hyperthyroid
severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID) mice generated in
a previous study by our group (18, 19) were used (Model II).
Finally, to determine whether the negative correlation between
the miR-21 and TIAM1 can be found in vivo, knockdown of
miR-21 in SK-Hep1 cells was injected into SCID mice via the tail
vein (Model III). All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide and
Chang-Gung Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (IACUC
Approval No. CGU09-011).
Statistical analysis
Phi correlation coefﬁcients were computed to determine the
correlations among the tumor/nontumor (T/N) ratios of TRa1,
miR-21, and TIAM1. Statistical analysis was conducted using
SPSS version 15.0. Other statistical analysis of data was conducted using Student t test. Data were considered statistically
signiﬁcant at P less than 0.05. Values are presented as means 
SD of at least 3 independent observations.

Results
Expression proﬁles of miRNA in HepG2 cells treated with
or without T3
Because of low expression of endogenous TRa1 in various
hepatoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2), a HepG2 cell line
expressing high levels of TRa1 (HepG2–TRa1) was established
to identify the miRNA genes potentially regulated by T3. In
total, 14 miRNAs potentially regulated by T3 were identiﬁed.
Ten of these miRNAs were upregulated by at least 3-fold, and 4
miRNAs were downregulated by at least 2-fold (Supplementary
Table S2). Among the 14 miRNA candidates, miR-21 has been
shown to be upregulated in various cancers, including hepatoma (7), suggestive of a role as a central oncomir (20). A pilot
study additionally revealed miR-21 upregulation by T3 in
HepG2–TRa1 cells. Interestingly, T3/thyroid hormone receptor signaling may exert both oncogenic (10) and tumor suppressor effects (21, 22). The ﬁndings that miR-21 is increased in
hepatoma tissue and potentially upregulated as a target of T3 in
HepG2 cells imply that T3 functions as an oncogene in this case.
Validation of T3-mediated upregulation of miR-21 in
HepG2–TR cells
To conﬁrm the positive regulation of miR-21 by T3, HepG2
cells stably expressing TRa1 (HepG2–TRa1) and TRb1
(HepG2–TRb1) were examined. A HepG2 cell line expressing
the empty vector, Neo, was used as the control (HepG2–Neo).
thyroid hormone receptor expression levels of the 3 stable
HepG2 cell lines are shown in Fig. 1A. The observed increase in
miR-21 expression after T3 treatment in the HepG2–TR cell
lines was both time- and dose-dependent (Figs 1B and C). In
contrast, no changes in miR-21 levels were evident following T3
treatment in the HepG2–Neo cell line (Fig. 1D). Moreover,
expression of the miR-21 primary transcript (pri-miR-21, accession No. AY699265, Supplementary Fig. S3) was stimulated in
a time- and dose-dependent manner in HepG2–TRa1 and

www.aacrjournals.org

HepG2–TRb1 cells treated with T3 (Fig. 1E and Supplementary
Fig. S4). Accordingly, we speculated that the promoter region of
miR-21 possesses a TRE. The miR-21 gene is located within the
intron of TMEM49. The TMEM49 level in T3-treated HepG2–
TRa1 cells was thus examined to eliminate the possibility that
increased miR-21 expression is attributed to T3-regulated
TMEM49. As shown in Fig. 1F, TMEM49 mRNA expression was
signiﬁcantly increased by 1.5- and 1.7-fold in HepG2–TRa1
cells treated with 10 nmol/L T3 for 48 and 72 hours, whereas the
miR-21 level was elevated approximately 4.3- and 5.9-fold under
the same conditions, respectively (Fig. 1B). This difference in
relative fold change between miR-21 and TMEM49 levels in
HepG2–TRa1 cells (4.3-fold vs. 1.5-fold and 5.9-fold vs. 1.7-fold
following 10 nmol/L T3 treatment for 48 or 72 hours, respectively) was signiﬁcant. The differences in fold change of miR-21
(both primary and mature forms) and TMEM49 induction by T3
are indicative of direct regulation of miR-21 expression by T3,
rather than coregulation with TMEM49.
Characterization of TRE in the miR-21 gene
To determine whether the promoter region of pri-miR-21
contains TRE, we analyzed the 3,000 nucleotides region
upstream of the gene using Vector NTI software. Seven putative TREs were identiﬁed in the pri-miR-21 promoter region
(3000/þ1; Supplementary Fig. S5). Among these, 2 putative
regions (TREA andB) were predicted to possess palindromic
(Pal) TRE, 3 (TREC, F andG) to include inverted palindrome
(Lap) TREs, and TREE to contain direct repeat 4 (DR4) TRE. In
addition, 2 overlapping response elements of TRED (Lap and
Pal) were predicted (Fig. 2A and B). A luciferase-based reporter
plasmid containing the promoter region (3000/45) was
constructed for the luciferase promoter assay. An approximate
3- to 5-fold increase in luciferase activity was induced by T3 (10
and 100 nmol/L) in HepG2–TRa1 cells (Fig. 2A, I), indicating a
response of the promoter region to T3/thyroid hormone receptor. To further identify the putative TRE within the 3,000/45
region that responds to T3/thyroid hormone receptor, serial
fragments (II to VII) were constructed for an additional
promoter assay. Among these fragments, only 2 containing the
TRED region (fragments III and V) displayed the luciferase
activity under T3 treatment conditions. In addition, the luciferase activity was dependent on the T3 dose (Fig. 2A). Our
luciferase promoter assay results indicate that the 1,109/
875 region of the pri-miR-21 promoter possesses native TRE.
The ChIP assay was subsequently conducted to further conﬁrm
the association of the 1,109/875 region with T3/TR in vivo.
The thyroid hormone receptor and RXR binding region was
narrowed down to positions 1,017/958 within this region of
the pri-miR-21 promoter (Fig. 2C, right). The native TRE of furin
associated with thyroid hormone receptor and RXR was used
as a positive control (Fig. 2C, left), whereas additive IgG was
used as a negative control in the ChIP assay. In summary, our
analytical results show that miR-21 is a direct thyroid hormone
receptor target gene–containing native TRE.
Prediction of miR-21 targets
The possible effects and mechanisms of action of T3/thyroid
hormone receptor-induced miR-21 in hepatoma cells were

further analyzed. Speciﬁc potential miR-21 target genes negatively regulated by T3 were selected as candidates for study. In
total, 307 genes were predicted as miR-21 targets using TargetScan software (http://www.targetscan.org/). Following
comparison with 3,029 genes potentially downregulated by
T3 in HepG2–TRa1 cells analyzed previously with cDNA
microarray (data not shown), 62 were selected. Among these,
5 genes (cyclin-dependent kinase: CDK6, mismatch repair
protein: MSH2, programmed cell death 4: Pdcd4, TGF-b type
II receptor: TGFBR2, and T-cell lymphoma invasion and
metastasis 1: TIAM1) were conﬁrmed as miR-21 targets (23–
27). Moreover, in view of the enhanced capability of hepatoma
cell migration after T3 application (14), Pdcd4 and TIAM1 are
reported to be associated with cell migration and invasion.
Earlier research has shown that miR-21 promotes migration
and invasion through a miR-21-PDCD4-AP-1 feedback loop in
hepatoma cells (28). Furthermore, a paradoxical role of TIAM1
in migration of various cancers has been documented (23, 29).
Accordingly, we focused on TIAM1 for further study to validate

2508

its role in liver carcinogenesis. The issue of whether TIAM1 is
also a direct target of miR-21 in hepatoma cells remains to be
established. Two sequences with 7 nucleotides (AUAAGCU) of
TIAM1 30 UTR, identiﬁed as the seed region of miR-21, were
predicted using TargetScan. Full-length TIAM1 30 UTR containing 2 seed regions located at positions þ202/þ208 and þ1861/
þ1867 were cloned into a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven
luciferase reporter plasmid. In the presence of TIAM1 30 UTR,
miR-21 suppressed luciferase activity. This suppressive effect
was diminished upon mutation of the 2 miR-21 binding sites in
HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A, left). In addition, knockdown of endogenous miR-21 (anti-miR-21) in the presence of TIAM1 30 UTR
induced luciferase activity, which was also decreased upon
mutation of the seed region of TIAM1 30 UTR (Fig. 3A, right). To
validate the effects of TIAM1 protein expression in the presence of miR-21 in hepatoma cells, Hep3B cells expressing
higher levels of TIAM1 than HepG2 cells were employed for
further analysis (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). We observed a decrease
in TIAM1 protein expression in the presence of miR-21 (Fig. 3B,

Regulation of miR-21 by Thyroid Hormone Receptor

Figure 2. The promoter region of miR-21 contains native TRE as a direct T3/TR target gene. A, HepG2–TRa1 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter
vectors with (pA3TK-Luc) or without (pGL3-Basic) a minimal thymidine kinase promoter expressing full-length and various fragments of pri-miR-21 promoter.

lanes 4 vs. 3), and conversely, increased TIAM1 expression
upon knockdown of endogenous miR-21 (using anti-miR-21) in
Hep3B cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 vs. 5). On the basis of these ﬁndings,
we propose that TIAM1 is a direct miR-21 target in hepatoma
cells.
Downregulation of TIAM1 by T3/thyroid hormone
receptor in Hep3B cells
As miR-21 is upregulated by T3, we further examined whether TIAM1 30 UTR luciferase activity is affected by the T3. As
shown in Fig. 3C, a signiﬁcant decrease in TIAM1 30 UTR
luciferase activity was observed in HepG2–TRa1 cells in the
presence of T3, compared with that in the absence of T3.
Subsequently, Hep3B cells expressing high levels of endogenous TIAM1 were used to overexpress TRa1 (Hep3B–
TRa1, Fig. 3D) for the purpose of validating TIAM1 regulation
by T3. The dose-dependent upregulation of miR-21 in T3-treated Hep3B–TRa1 (Fig. 3E) was similar to that in HepG2–TR
cells (Figs 1B and C). T3-mediated repression of the TIAM1
protein level was observed in Hep3B–TRa1 cells (Fig. 3F, lanes
1–4). To verify that the effect of T3 on TIAM1 is mediated, at
least in part, through miR-21, knockdown of endogenous miR21 (using anti-miR-21) in Hep3B–TRa1 cells was conducted.
Notably, suppression of TIAM1 protein in Hep3B–TRa1 cells

www.aacrjournals.org

by T3 was rescued in cells depleted of endogenous miR-21 (Fig.
3F, lanes 6 vs. 8). The data presented in Fig. 3 suggest that the
negative regulation of TIAM1 by T3 occurs through the T3
-mediated upregulation of miR-21 in hepatoma cells. MSH2, a
tumor suppressor downregulated by T3/thyroid hormone
receptor signaling and miR-21, was additionally examined. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S6A, the luciferase activity of fulllength MSH2 30 UTR (272 nt) containing a seed site (positions
þ33/þ39) was inhibited by miR-21, which was partially
restored upon mutation of the seed region. Moreover, MSH2
expression was suppressed in the presence of T3 or upon
overexpression of miR-21 (Supplementary Fig. S6B and C,
lane 2), and conversely, increased upon knockdown of miR-21
(anti-miR-21, Supplementary Fig. S6C, lane 4).
Correlations among TR, miR-21, and TIAM1 in hepatoma
patients
To determine whether thyroid hormone receptor, miR-21,
and TIAM1 expression patterns are correlated in hepatoma,
total RNA from paired tumor and adjacent nontumor liver
tissues was extracted from a series of 40 consecutive
patients with hepatoma. The T/N ratios of TRa1, miR-21,
and TIAM1, assessed using qRT-PCR, are presented in Supplementary Table S3. TRa1 RNA expression was higher in

87.5% (35/40) of tumor compared with nontumor tissues.
In 35 patients with hepatoma with increased TRa1 expression in tumor tissues, miR-21 was concomitantly increased
in 80.0% (28/35) of the tumor regions. In addition, TIAM1
RNA expression was decreased in 71.4% (20/28) of tumor
tissues in 28 patients with hepatoma displaying the upregulation of TRa1 and miR-21. Phi correlation coefﬁcients
revealed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between the T/N
ratios of TRa1 and miR-21 (w ¼ 0.444, P ¼ 0.005). Moreover, a
signiﬁcant negative correlation between the T/N ratios of
miR-21 and TIAM1 was observed (w ¼ 0.370, P ¼ 0.019).
Our analytic results imply that the correlations among TRa1,
miR-21, and TIAM1 expression patterns in patients with
hepatoma are similar to those observed in hepatoma cells
in vitro.
T3 and miR-21 enhance Hep3B cell migration
Stimulation of T3 promotes migration in HepG2 cells (14).
Consistent with this ﬁnding, an earlier study has shown
that a miR-21 inhibitor suppresses migration of Huh7 cells
(30). To establish the migration properties of Hep3B cells
treated with T3 or displaying elevated miR-21 expression, the

Transwell assay was conducted. Our data showed that
migration of Hep3B–TRa1 cells stimulated with T3 is
enhanced (Fig. 4Aa). Similarly, cell migration (Fig. 4Ab) and
invasion (Fig. 4B) were promoted in miR-21-overexpressing
Hep3B cells. Conversely, cell migration was inhibited in
Hep3B cells depleted of endogenous miR-21 (Fig. 4Ac).
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proposed as an index of enhanced metastasis in various malignant tumor types (31). It is suggested that the EMT markers,
vimentin and b-catenin, play important roles in metastasis
of hepatoma (32, 33). Interestingly, increased expression of
these 2 molecules was observed in not only Hep3B–TRa1
cells treated with T3, but also in miR-21-overexpressing
Hep3B cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–5). The downstream target
proteins of b-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1, were additionally elevated by T3 (Fig. 4C). b-Catenin was signiﬁcantly
upregulated (by 1.8-fold) in miR-21-overexpressing Hep3B
cells, compared with the control cell line (Fig. 4C lanes 5 vs.
4), and signiﬁcantly downregulated (by 60%) in the miR-21
knockdown cell line (Fig. 4C, lanes 7 vs. 6). Moreover,
vimentin was downregulated upon knockdown of endogenous miR-21 (Fig. 4C, lanes 7 vs. 6). Our results collectively

indicate that the effects of miR-21 and T3 on cell migration
and metastasis-associated molecules (such as vimentin and
b-catenin) are similar in Hep3B cells.
TIAM1 knockdown in Hep3B cells promotes migration
and invasion
To investigate the effects of TIAM1 on cell migration and the
underlying signaling pathways, we conducted knockdown of
TIAM1 in Hep3B or SK-Hep1 cells. The TIAM1 protein levels in
4 Hep3B stable cell lines are shown in Fig. 5A. The b-catenin

level was signiﬁcantly enhanced (by 1.6- to 1.7-fold) in the 2
TIAM1 knockdown Hep3B cell lines (shTIAM1; K1, K2), compared with the control cell line (shNeo; N1, N2; Fig. 5A). The
phosphorylated b-catenin level was downregulated by almost
40% in the K1 and K2 cell lines. Immunoblot analysis revealed a
marked increase in the expression levels of the b-catenin target
proteins (c-myc, cyclin D1, and c-Jun) in the 2 cell lines
(Fig. 5A). In addition, vimentin expression was increased in
Hep3B cells depleted of TIAM1 (Fig. 5A). K1 and K2 cell lines
displayed enhanced activity (by 1.4- to 3.6-fold) of pro-matrix

metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 (72 kDa; Fig. 5B). Moreover, migration (Figs 5C and D) and invasion (Figs 5E and F) abilities were
increased approximately 3.1- to 6.0-fold and 1.5- to 2.8-fold,
respectively, in these cell lines. To further verify the effect of
miR-21 on metastasis in vivo, SK-Hep1 cells possessing high
metastatic ability and endogenous TIAM1 expression were
used. Expression of miR-21 was stimulated by T3 (Supplementary Fig. S7A), whereas TIAM1 and MSH2 levels were
decreased. Moreover, c-myc and cyclin D1 were upregulated by
T3 (Supplementary Fig. S7B), and b-catenin was signiﬁcantly
downregulated in anti-miR-21–expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Phosphorylated b-catenin protein was upregulated in the anti-miR-21–expressing cell line. Expression levels
of c-myc, cyclin D1, and vimentin were signiﬁcantly decreased
(Supplementary Fig. S7C). Our data collectively indicate that
miR-21 stimulation by T3 and subsequent TIAM1 suppression
promotes cell migration and invasion in hepatoma cells,
possibly through the upregulation of b-catenin, c-myc, c-jun,
and vimentin (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7).
Suppression of cell migration induced by miR-21
knockdown is rescued by T3 in Hep3B–TRa1 cells
To conﬁrm the ﬁnding that T3/thyroid hormone receptor
signaling promotes cell migration via T3-mediated positive
regulation of miR-21, Hep3B–TRa1 cells depleted of miR-21
were examined in the presence or absence of T3 using the
Transwell migration assay. As shown in Fig. 6, the cell migration was markedly promoted in the presence of T3, compared
with that in the absence of T3 (Figs 6A, I vs. II and 6B). The cell
migration effect in the absence of T3 was signiﬁcantly suppressed after miR-21 knockdown (Fig. 6A, I vs. III and 6B),
which was rescued following administration of T3 (Figs 6A, III
vs. IV and 6B). Moreover, promotion of cell migration by T3 was
markedly repressed after miR-21 knockdown (Fig. 6A, II vs. IV
and 6B). These results show that T3 rescues anti-miR-21–
mediated suppression of cell migration. Furthermore, T3
-induced cell migration is inhibited by anti-miR-21. On the
basis of these ﬁndings, we propose that T3-mediated positive
regulation of miR-21 promotes Hep3B cell migration.
Correlations among TR, miR-21, and TIAM1 in vivo
To investigate whether the effects of miR-21 in vitro can be
replicated in vivo, 3 animal models were designed. First, surgical thyroidectomy was conducted in 2 groups of 6-week-old
male SD rats to determine the in vivo responses of miR-21 to
T3 treatment. One group (Tx þ T3) was injected daily with T3 for
2 weeks, the second group (Tx) received no T3 injections, and
the third group included sham-operated controls. Rats were
sacriﬁced at the end of the experiment (4 weeks after thyroidectomy), and serum was collected for T3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone determination, as described previously (21).
Stem-loop qRT-PCR analysis disclosed that miR-21 expression
in the TxþT3 group was 2.8-fold compared with the sham
group, and conversely, 0.7-fold compared with sham group in
the Tx group (Fig. 7A), indicative of a positive correlation
between T3/thyroid hormone receptor and miR-21 in vivo.
Second, to determine whether the in vitro metastatic effect
of miR-21/T3 occurs in vivo, SCID mice were injected with J7-

subjected to hyperthyroid, euthyroid, and hypothyroid conditions after injection (18, 19). The hyperthyroid group of SCID
mice injected with J7-TRa1 cells displayed higher miR-21
expression (Fig. 7B), but lower TIAM1 expression compared
with euthyroid (control) group (Fig. 7C, IX vs. III). Conversely,
the hypothyroid group displayed decreased miR-21 (Fig. 7B)
and higher TIAM1 expression (Fig. 7C, VI vs. III). Tumors are
marked with black lines. Figure 7C, I, II, IV, V, VII, and VIII
represent hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, with II, V,

a 98.2% decrease in metastatic index (tumor density per cm2;

(Fig. 7D, I, and E). Moreover, a stronger dark brown color

of SK-Hep1-anti-miR-21 xenografts (Fig. 7D, IV, arrowhead),
compared with SK-Hep1–scrambled xenografts (Fig. 7D, II).

T3/thyroid hormone receptor signaling promotes cell invasiveness involved in hepatoma progression through the direct
or indirect upregulation of several genes, including furin (10),

inhibitor-1 (18), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(19). MiRNAs are small RNA molecules processed from endogenous precursor RNA with stem-loop structures that negatively regulate gene expression. To date, several tumor progression-related genes have been identiﬁed as speciﬁc miRNA
targets (34, 35). Aberrant miRNA expression has been reported
in various tumors, including liver cancer (36, 37). Data from the
current study indicate that both T3/thyroid hormone receptor
signaling and miRNAs affect tumor cell progression through

Regulation of miR-21 by Thyroid Hormone Receptor

TIAM1 suppression and upregulation of b-catenin, vimentin,
and MMP2 (Supplementary Fig. S8). Moreover, the correlations
among TRa1, miR-21, and TIAM1 expression patterns in
patients with hepatoma appear similar to those reported in
hepatoma cells.
Previous studies have reported that T3 stimulation affects
the expression of speciﬁc miRNAs in mouse hepatocyte cells.
T3 upregulates Gpd2, and Mup1 mRNA may be associated with
decreased miR-206 expression in the presence of T3 (38).
However, the molecular mechanism underlying T3-mediated
regulation of miRNAs remains unclear at present. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to clearly show that the
miR-21 promoter region containing native TRE bound to
thyroid hormone receptor and RXR is directly upregulated by
T3 in hepatoma cells. Both T3/thyroid hormone receptor
signaling and miR-21 stimulation promoted hepatoma cell
migration. Moreover, T3 and miR-21 stimulation was associated with suppression of TIAM1 protein expression. Our
experiments further conﬁrmed that TIAM1 is a direct target
gene of miR-21. Notably, suppression of TIAM1 by T3 was
rescued upon knockdown of endogenous miR-21. Suppression
of cell migration with anti-miR-21 was partially restored after
administration of T3. Conversely, T3-enhanced cell migration
was inhibited upon endogenous miR-21 knockdown. Overall,
our analytic data support the promotion of hepatoma cell
migration and invasion through a T3/TR-miR-21-TIAM1 pathway (Supplementary Fig. S8). In addition, the tumor suppressor
gene, MSH2 (39), another miR-21 target, was downregulated
through T3/thyroid hormone receptor signaling in hepatoma
cells. The associations among T3/thyroid hormone receptor,
miR-21, and MSH2 further conﬁrm the pathway of T3/TR-miR21-target in hepatoma cells. On the basis of the reported
function of MSH2 as a tumor suppressor, our data support
a role of T3/thyroid hormone receptor as an oncogene.
Suppression of TIAM1 expression by miR-21 or knockdown
of endogenous TIAM1 with RNAi led to the promotion of
migration and invasion of Hep3B cells. Similar results were
observed with colon carcinoma cells overexpressing miR-21,
whereby enhanced cell migration and invasion were inhibited
upon TIAM1 overexpression (23). In addition, TIAM1 is a direct
target of miR-21 in LIM 1863 colon carcinoma cells (23). TIAM1
inhibits the migratory and invasive properties of epithelial and
melanoma cells via different mechanisms. In epithelial cells,
TIAM1 promotes E-cadherin–mediated cell–cell adhesion and
shifts the balance between invasion-promoting MMP2 and
MMP9 and invasion-inhibiting tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) to suppress cell migration and
invasion ability (40). In melanoma cells, TIAM1-mediated
inhibition of migration and invasion is dependent on increased
Rac activity (41). In the current study, we propose that knockdown of TIAM1 promotes migratory and invasive abilities in
hepatoma cells through activation of the b-catenin pathway
and increase in vimentin and MMP2 levels.
Similarly, the estrogen receptor a (ERa) binds the miR-221222 transcription start site recruiting co-repressors to suppress
their transcriptional activity (42). Interestingly, Zhao and
colleagues (43) reported that ERa is negatively regulated by
miR-221 and miR-222 in breast cancer. These 2 studies support

www.aacrjournals.org

the existence of a negative regulatory loop involving miR-221222 and ERa (42). However, the issue of whether such a
regulatory loop can be identiﬁed between miRNA and thyroid
hormone receptor is yet to be established. In fact, degradation
of thyroid hormone receptor induced via T3 binding has been
reported previously (44). In view of the ﬁnding that miR-27a
induces a decrease in TRb1 protein without affecting the
mRNA level (45), the possibility of a miR-21–triggered decrease
in thyroid hormone receptor is speculated.
Wnt/b-catenin signaling is commonly activated in hepatoma (46). Notably, hepatitis B virus X protein is reported to
activate b-catenin signaling (47). Furthermore, hepatitis C
virus-induced miR-155 expression promotes hepatocyte proliferation and tumorigenesis via activation of Wnt signaling
(48). Consistently, Lan and colleagues (49) observed a positive
correlation between activation of the b-catenin pathway and in
situ expression of miR-21 in colon carcinoma cells. In the
current study, we have shown that b-catenin signaling is
activated by miR-21, which also reported to be overexpressed
in hepatoma (50) and upregulated by T3/thyroid hormone
receptor signaling.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings collectively illustrate that miR-21
is directly upregulated by T3 through thyroid hormone receptor binding to native TRE of the miR-21 promoter region in
hepatoma cells. T3 enhances migration and invasion by targeting miR-21 to downregulate TIAM1 in hepatoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S8).
