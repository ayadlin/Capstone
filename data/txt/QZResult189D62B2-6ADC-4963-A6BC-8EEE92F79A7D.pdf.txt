Abstract
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is used, in current practice, as an effective chemotherapeutic agent for acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, the side effects and relatively low efﬁcacy of As2O3 in treating other
leukemias have limited its wider use in therapeutic applications. In the present study, we found that the
expression of carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) affects the resistance to As2O3 in leukemias, including APL; As2O3
upregulated CBR1 expression at the transcriptional level by stimulating the activity of the transcription factor
activator protein-1. Moreover, CBR1 overexpression was sufﬁcient to protect cells against As2O3 through
modulation of the generation of reactive oxygen species, whereas the attenuation of CBR1 was sufﬁcient to
sensitize cells to As2O3. A combination treatment with the speciﬁc CBR1 inhibitor hydroxy-PP-Me remarkably
increased As2O3-induced apoptotic cell death compared with As2O3 alone, both in vitro and in vivo. These results
were conﬁrmed in primary cultured human acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, with no signiﬁcant cell
death observed in normal leukocytes. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicate that CBR1 contributes to the
low efﬁcacy of As2O3 and, therefore, is a rational target for the development of combination chemotherapy with
As2O3 in diverse leukemias including APL. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4214–24. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) is a ubiquitous NADPH-dependent enzyme belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/
reductase family (1). This enzyme catalyzes a signiﬁcant
number of biologically and pharmacologically active substrates, including a variety of endogenous and xenobiotic
carbonyl compounds (2). The best substrates of CBR1 are
quinones, including ubiquinone-1 and tocopherolquinone
(vitamin E). Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) is a constitutive factor
in the respiratory chain, and tocopherolquinone protects the
lipids of biological membranes against lipid peroxidation,
indicating that CBR1 plays an important role as an oxidation–reduction catalyst in cellular processes (3). Moreover,
CBR1 inactivates highly reactive lipid aldehydes, such as
4-oxonon-2-enal (ONE), 4-hydroxynon-2-enal (HNE), and acrolein, which are able to modify proteins and capable of producing DNA damage within cells (4). Further, overexpression of

human CBR1 in NIH3T3 cells provides protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cellular damage (5), which
supports CBR1 as a major contributor to the control of
oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress can regulate gene expression by activating
several transcription factors (6), including the redox-sensitive
activator protein-1 (AP-1). As a heterodimeric protein, AP-1 is
composed of subunits belonging to the Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1,
and Fra2), Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), and activating transcription factor families (7). AP-1 regulates gene expression by
binding to the DNA sequence at speciﬁc AP-1 binding sites.
Further, AP-1 activity is partially regulated through the phosphorylation of its various subunits. Importantly, the transcriptional activity of c-Jun is increased through phosphorylation by
the Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK)/stress-activated protein
kinases, which are strongly stimulated by oxidative stress (8).
Therefore, AP-1 is known to be important in the regulation of
gene expression by oxidative stress.
As2O3 has been reported to be an effective therapeutic agent
in both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients with acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (9–12). This success has
prompted an interest in the molecular mechanisms of action
underlying the clinical effectiveness of this cytotoxic agent.
Previous studies have shown that As2O3 induces apoptosis and
partial differentiation in leukemic promyelocytes (13, 14). The
susceptibility of cells to undergo apoptosis in the presence of
As2O3 appears to be dependent on the intracellular redox
homeostasis. In particular, the effectiveness of As2O3 in leading
to apoptosis is associated with an increased generation
of intracellular ROS in the presence of this cytotoxic agent
(15, 16). The therapeutic potential of As2O3 is not restricted

to APL cells. The ability of As2O3 to induce cell death has
been observed in other malignant cells, including non-APL
acute myeloid leukemia cells, myeloma cells, and chronic
myeloid leukemia cells, as well as various solid tumor cells
in vitro (17–19).
However, the clinical application of As2O3 is limited in other
types of leukemia because of their low susceptibility to it (20,
21). Moreover, As2O3 can have resultant side effects or later
repercussions in patients with APL (22). Therefore, a strategy
to enhance the efﬁcacy of As2O3 is required to enable its use in a
wide variety of medical applications and to reduce its side
effects. In this article, we report that the upregulation of CBR1
by As2O3 renders leukemia cells resistant to apoptosis. Further,
we show that the combination of a CBR1 inhibitor with As2O3
substantially increases apoptotic cell death and inhibits tumor
growth relative to As2O3 alone in vitro and in vivo. In addition,
we show a synergistic cytotoxic effect in a combination treatment on primary leukemia cells.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
was conducted as described previously (25). Cross-linked U937
chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against p-c-Jun and p-c-Fos. The primers used in
the PCR to detect AP-1 protein binding to the CBR1 promoter
were as follows: forward, 50 -TGGAAAATCAGACACCAGACCCCTCAC-30 ; reverse, 50 -GCAGGGAAGAAATGTAACTGCATGTGG-30 .
Lipid peroxidation assay
Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) levels using the Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive
Substances Assay Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). The ﬁnal MDA levels
were expressed as fold changes in the treatment groups relative to the control group.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human myeloid leukemia cell lines (U937, K562, HL-60, and
NB4) were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,
Korea). All of the cell lines were regularly passaged and routinely mycoplasma-tested and genotyped (AmpFISTR Identiﬁler Kit; Applied Biosystems) to verify their identity. Cell lines
were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
Primary leukemia cells were obtained from bone marrow
samples of patients with newly diagnosed AML or CML. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation and were at least 80% or higher malignant cells. The
isolation of CD34-positive cells from normal bone marrow was
conducted using the immunomagnetic microbead method.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
analysis
The real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
(qRT-PCR) was carried out by using SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI PRISM 7300
real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Based on the 2DDCT method
(23), calculations were done using the following equation:
sample  DCTcontrol]
R (ratio) ¼ 2[DCT
. The integrity of the ampliﬁed
DNA was conﬁrmed by determining the melting temperature.
The data were expressed as the fold changes in the treatment
groups in relation to the control groups and were normalized
to GAPDH levels. The primer sequences were designed by
Primer 3 and UCSC In-Silico PCR and were as follows: CBR1
forward, 50 -AACAAGTTTGTGGAAGGATACAAAGAAGGGA30 ; CBR1 reverse, 50 -TGTTCAACTCCTTCTCTGAAACAAATTGTC-30 ; GAPDH forward, 50 -TGACCACAGTCCATGCCAT30 ; GAPDH reverse, 50 -TTCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGT-30 .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was conducted as described previously (24) using the following oligonucleotides:

Animals and xenograft model
Female athymic BALB/c nude mice (5–6 weeks old) were
purchased from Orient Bio, Inc. (Sungnam, Korea). The animals were placed in a pathogen-free environment and allowed
to acclimate for a week before being used in the study. The
experimental protocol [KHUASP(SE)-10-018] was approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyung
Hee University. U937 cells (2  107) were injected subcutaneously into the mice (n ¼ 5 mice/group). The mice were then
injected intraperitoneally with 3-(7-isopropyl-4-(methylamino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5yl)phenol (hydroxy-PPMe; 30 mg/kg), As2O3 (5 mg/kg), or a combination of both
compounds once every 3 days. Tumor weights were calculated with the formula of (L  l2)/2, where L is the tumor
length and l is the tumor width, both of which were measured
with a set of calipers.
Immunohistochemistry
Small pieces of tumor tissues were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and sectioned at a thickness of 6 mm. The
sections were incubated overnight at 4 C with a monoclonal
antibody against CBR1 (Imgenex). The immunostained specimens were visualized using the Dako EnVision Detection Kit
(Dako).
In situ apoptosis assay
Tumor tissue samples from mice subjected to different
treatments were sectioned by using a cryostat and mounted
on silane-coated slides. The in situ apoptosis assay was conducted by using the DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL System
(Promega). The positive apoptotic nuclei were stained dark
brown.
Statistical analysis
The results were expressed as the mean  SE of at least 3
independent experiments. The difference between 2 means
was analyzed with the Student's t test and considered statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05. The cytotoxic combination

effect of hydroxy-PP-Me with As2O3 was calculated by using
CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).

Results
CBR1 is upregulated at the transcriptional level by As2O3
To investigate whether CBR1 is induced by As2O3, we ﬁrst
conducted Western blot analysis on total cell lysates from the
leukemia cell lines following treatment with As2O3. When cells
were treated with either 2 mmol/L (U937, K562, and HL-60) or
0.5 mmol/L (NB4) As2O3, the CBR1 protein levels were continuously increased for up to 48 hours in a time-dependent
manner (2.8-fold for U937, 2.6-fold for K562, 3.0-fold for HL-

60, and 2.1-fold for NB4 cells; Fig. 1A). To conﬁrm this result, we
conducted RT-PCR. The CBR1 mRNA levels showed a substantial 4- to 5-fold increase in the As2O3-treated cells (Fig. 1B).
A similar increase in the CBR1 mRNA levels was observed by
qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C).
For determining whether As2O3 increased CBR1 mRNA
levels through mRNA stabilization or transcriptional activation, U937 cells were grown under As2O3 treatment for 48 hours
and then incubated in the presence of actinomycin D (5 mg/mL)
with or without As2O3 for an additional 12 hours. On the realtime qRT-PCR results, similar decay rates were observed for the
CBR1 mRNA levels under both conditions (Fig. 1D), indicating

that As2O3 induced an increase in CBR1 mRNA levels through
transcriptional activation rather than mRNA stabilization.
The CBR1 promoter is activated by AP-1
AP-1 is stimulated by diverse stimuli including oxidative
stress (8, 26). Moreover, As2O3 has been shown to induce
apoptosis through ROS production in a number of different
cancer cell lines, ranging from diverse leukemia cell lines to
solid tumor cell lines (19, 27, 28). Therefore, we explored
whether AP-1 would upregulate CBR1 expression in the presence of As2O3. The phosphorylation and total protein levels of
c-Fos and c-Jun were increased by As2O3 in U937 cells (Fig. 2A).
Moreover, SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase,

abrogated not only phospho-c-Jun levels but also As2O3induced CBR1 protein levels (Fig. 2B). In addition, knockdown
of endogenous c-Jun and c-Fos showed the same results as the
inhibitor (Fig. 2C). Bioinformatic analysis revealed the CBR1
promoter contained an AP-1 binding site located at 819 bp
upstream of the transcriptional initiation site. To determine
whether the AP-1 site was involved in the response to As2O3
treatment, we designed several luciferase reporter constructs
and conducted luciferase assays. No changes in luciferase
activity were observed in cells transfected with the empty
pGL3-basic vector under the As2O3 treatment or in the control.
In contrast, cells transfected with pGL3-CBR1/1000 showed an
7-fold increase in luciferase activity under As2O3 treatment,

while cells carrying pGL3-CBR1/1000M showed signiﬁcantly
less activity (Fig. 2D). Next, an electrophoretic mobility shift
assay was performed to assess the binding afﬁnity of AP-1 to
its binding site in the CBR1 promoter. The wild-type oligonucleotide incubated with nuclear extracts from U937 cells
treated with As2O3 exhibited strong mobility-shifted bands,
whereas the mutated oligonucleotide and a 100-fold excess of
cold oligonucleotide showed either weak or no mobility-shifted
bands (Fig. 2E). To verify these results, we conducted ChIP
assays. AP-1 complex (phospho-c-Jun and phospho-c-Fos)
directly bound to the CBR1 promoter (Fig. 2F). Collectively,
these results indicate that CBR1 expression can be induced at
the transcriptional level by AP-1 in response to As2O3.
Overexpression of CBR1 enhances cell survival in the
presence of As2O3 but knockdown of CBR1 sensitizes cells
to As2O3
As CBR1 was directly induced by As2O3 (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that the upregulation of CBR1 could be involved in the
resistance to As2O3 treatment in leukemia cells. To verify this
hypothesis, we generated stably transfected cell lines by transfecting U937 and K562 cells with Mock, CBR1/WT, SC-shRNA,
or CBR1 shRNA vectors. Compared with the Mock clones,
CBR1 was overexpressed 2- to 3-fold in 3 independent CBR1/
WT clones (Fig. 3A). In contrast, CBR1 expression was strongly
suppressed by the CBR1 shRNA in 3 independent CBR1 shRNA
clones (Fig. 3A). To observe the effect of CBR1 on cell survival
against As2O3 treatment, we conducted a cell viability assay.
Following treatment with 4 mmol/L As2O3, the CBR1/WT
transfected cell lines showed better survival rates than the
Mock-transfected cell lines in an expression-level–dependent
manner in both cell lines (Fig. 3B). However, the cell lines
transfected with CBR1 shRNA exhibited a marked reduction in
cell survival in a suppression-dependent manner, compared
with the cell lines transfected with scrambled shRNA (Fig. 3B).
Similar results were observed for the levels of the apoptotic
markers poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and caspase-3
(Fig. 3C). Further, we assessed the antioxidant activity of CBR1
in both transfected cell lines. As2O3 resulted in the enhanced
generation of ROS (Fig. 3D). Importantly, CBR1 overexpression
signiﬁcantly suppressed enhanced ROS generation (Fig. 3D),
while CBR1 knockdown aggravated ROS generation (Fig. 3D).
Finally, to conﬁrm the impact of CBR1 expression levels on
sensitivity to As2O3, we examined cell survival rates in c-Jun
and c-Fos knockdown cells after treatment with As2O3 alone or
with combined treatment. The c-Jun and c-Fos knockdown
cells were more sensitive to As2O3 alone or combination with
the CBR1 inhibitor than the scrambled siRNA-transfected cells.
However, the trends in the survival rates of cells treated with
As2O3 alone were similar to those treated with a combination
of As2O3 and the CBR1 inhibitor (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these
ﬁndings indicate that CBR1 protects cells against the apoptosis
induced by As2O3 and provides resistance to As2O3.
A combined treatment with hydroxy-PP-Me and As2O3
enhances cell death in leukemia cells
Recently, hydroxy-PP-Me has been reported to be a selective
inhibitor of CBR1 (29). To further investigate the role of CBR1

4218

in the resistance to As2O3-induced cell death, we treated cells
with As2O3 alone or in combination with hydroxy-PP-Me. We
conducted a cell viability assay after exposure to 4 mmol/L
(U937, K562, and HL-60) or 1 mmol/L (NB4) As2O3 alone or in
combination with 20 mmol/L hydroxy-PP-Me for 48 hours.
Co-treatment with hydroxy-PP-Me and As2O3 signiﬁcantly
enhanced cell death relative to treatment with As2O3 alone
(Fig. 4A). Moreover, the combined treatment increased the
cleavages of PARP and caspase-3 (Fig. 4B). The combined
effect of hydroxy-PP-Me with As2O3 was further conﬁrmed in
an Annexin V/PI assay (Fig. 4C). Moreover, a TUNEL assay
provided similar results to those shown in Fig. 4D. Finally,
we calculated the drug combination index and observed it to
be less than 1.0 (Fig. 4E), indicating a synergistic effect
between hydroxy-PP-Me and As2O3. Overall, these data
indicate that the inhibition of CBR1 in combination with
As2O3 is a new means to promote the efﬁcacy of As2O3-based
regimens.
Inhibition of CBR1 ampliﬁes As2O3-induced ROS
generation through NADPH oxidase activation
As2O3 induces ROS generation through increasing expression levels of NADPH oxidase (NOX) subunits (30). To investigate the molecular mechanism by which the inhibition of
CBR1 increases As2O3-mediated cell death, we measured ROS
levels in a time-dependent manner in U937 cells treated with
As2O3 alone or in combination with hydroxy-PP-Me. The
combined treatment resulted in a continuous increase in ROS
levels for up to 36 hours and, relative to As2O3 treatment alone,
caused a 2-fold increase in ROS generation. To test whether the
enhanced ROS production in the combined treatment could
also be mediated by the NOX pathway, cells were pretreated
with 200 mmol/L apocynin, a NOX inhibitor. ROS was significantly reduced in cells treated with As2O3 alone or in combination with hydroxy-PP-Me (Fig. 5A and data not shown).
Consistent with these results, the combination of hydroxy-PPMe and As2O3 more strongly increased the expression and the
translocations of the NOX subunits p47phox and p67phox from
the cytosol to the membrane than As2O3 alone. Further, these
translocations to the membrane were almost completely abrogated by apocynin in both cases (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the
expression levels of the lipid peroxidation products HNE, MDA,
and acrolein were all increased in the cells co-treated with
hydroxy-PP-Me and As2O3. In addition, increased expression
was observed for ALDH and AR, which were known to detoxify
HNE (31). This increased expression for both the lipid peroxidation products and ALDH and AR was greater than 4-fold
when compared with that of the non-treated cells but was
signiﬁcantly decreased in the apocynin-treated cells (Fig. 5C),
providing additional evidence supporting NOX involvement.
Finally, we tested the formation of MDA, a lipid peroxidation
indicator, and observed the same patterns of change (Fig. 5D).
To determine whether increased ROS generation induces cell
death, we pretreated cells with the ROS scavengers N-acetyl Lcysteine (NAC) or 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid
(Tiron, a superoxide scavenger) for 30 minutes and then
measured cell viability after 48 hours on treatment with As2
O3 alone or in combination with hydroxy-PP-Me. Both

antioxidants protected cells from As2O3 alone or in the
combined treatment (Fig. 5E). Finally, to examine the direct
involvement of NOX in the production of ROS in treatments
with As2O3 alone or in combination therapy with hydroxy-PPMe, we transfected cells with p47phox- or p67phox-speciﬁc
siRNA or a scrambled siRNA. The cells transfected with
p47phox or p67phox siRNA showed a signiﬁcantly lower
generaton of ROS compared with both the non-transfected
and scrambled siRNA-transfected cells after treatment with
As2O3 alone and combination therapy. Further, transfection
with either p47phox or p67phox siRNA resulted in a substan-

tial protection against As2O3 alone or combination with
hydroxy-PP-Me (Fig. 5F). Collectively, these observations
indicate that the enhanced ROS generation by the CBR1
inhibitor in combination with As2O3 is caused via NOX
activation.
Inhibition of CBR1 increases the antitumor activity of

the inoculation of U937 cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally with hydroxy-PP-Me (30 mg/kg) alone, As2O3 (5 mg/kg)

every 3 days. On Western blot analysis, it was observed that the
CBR1 protein levels in grafted tumor tissues were upregulated
5-fold after a single intraperitoneal injection of As2O3 (Fig.
6A). This strong induction was further corroborated by immunohistochemistry results (Fig. 6B). To determine the combined
effects of hydroxy-PP-Me and As2O3 on tumor growth in vivo,
tumor growth was measured for up to 18 days after com-

mencement of the treatments. The results showed that the
combination therapy with hydroxy-PP-Me plus As2O3 markedly suppressed tumor growth compared with treatment using
As2O3 alone (Fig. 6C). In addition, these results were conﬁrmed
by measuring tumor weight (Fig. 6D). Finally, we observed
enhanced expression of apoptotic markers and apoptotic
nuclei in the tumor specimens from mice injected with both
compounds compared with As2O3 alone (Fig. 6E and 6F).
Collectively, these data indicate that As2O3 effectively suppresses tumor growth when combined with the CBR1
inhibitor.

Effects of hydroxy-PP-Me and As2O3 alone or in
combination on cell death in myeloid primary leukemia
cells
To explore the clinical applicability of CBR1 inhibition, the
effect of co-treatment with As2O3 and hydroxy-PP-Me were
tested in primary leukemia cells isolated from 3 APL, 10 AML,
and 10 CML patients and in normal CD34-positive bone
marrow cells isolated from healthy donors. The cells were
treated with 20 mmol/L hydroxy-PP-Me alone, 4 mmol/L As2O3
alone, or with combination therapy for 48 hours. Treatment
with hydroxy-PP-Me alone resulted in no cell death in all of the
samples. Meanwhile, As2O3 resulted in a cell death rate of
20% in the AML and CML samples. However, the co-treat-

ment with both compounds signiﬁcantly enhanced cell death
in all of the primary cultured cells. In contrast, even the
combined treatment resulted in a low rate of cell death in the
normal CD34-positive bone marrow cells (Fig. 7).

Discussion
As2O3 is a drug that is widely used for the clinical
treatment of leukemia. A reduction in the relapse rate and
an improvement in survival are achieved by using As2O3 in
patients with APL, especially in high-risk patients (32–34).
However, two common and potentially serious side effects
of As2O3 treatment, such as APL differentiation syndrome

Moreover, when As2O3 is administered intravenously at a
conventional dose of 0.15 mg/kg per day, side effects such as
leukocytosis, headache, fatigue, fever, cough, dyspnea, and
gastrointestinal disorders are commonly observed (22). Further, although As2O3 had been investigated in the treatment
of other types of leukemia, most of these studies showed
considerably reduced antitumor effects at clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3. Therefore, the development of
more effective treatment modalities for As2O3 is urgent for
the treatment of diverse leukemias and solid tumors in
addition to APL.

The transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for the induction of CBR1 have rarely been studied, although microarray
studies identiﬁed CBR1 as one of the responsive proteins to
several inducers, including phenethyl isothiocyanate (35), D3T
(36), and sulphorophane (37, 38). The transcription factor Nrf2
and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand have been hypothesized to induce CBR1 (39). We previously showed that CBR1 is
transcriptionally induced in response to hypoxia (40). Based on
our results, we propose that AP-1 is a transcription factor for
CBR1 induction under As2O3 exposure. In the presence of As2
O3, the Fos and Jun subunits were increased. In addition, the
As2O3-induced CBR1 activation was blocked by SP600125 and

CBR1 in As2O3 Treatment

detoxiﬁcation of the reactive carbonyls by reducing the carbonyl group to an alcohol (3, 4) and reactive carbonyls are well
known to upregulate the expression of diverse genes at the
transcriptional level (41, 42), it is quite possible that the
combined treatment enhances ROS production by As2O3 via
augmenting expression of NOX subunits in the cells. However,
the complete molecular mechanism that coordinates all these
events is yet to be determined.
Although As2O3 increases apoptotic cell death in various
tumors, the antitumor effects of As2O3 in other leukemia
cells and in solid tumor cells were lower than those in APL
(20, 21). To improve the therapeutic efﬁcacy of As2O3 in As2
O3-resistant tumors, interest has been focused on combination therapy of As2O3 with other compounds, such as
cisplatin (43, 44), L-buthionine sulfoximine (45), docosahexaenoic acid (46), sulindac (47), and anthraquinones (48). Our
results indicate that CBR1 is a cellular defense protein
against oxidative stress induced by As2O3 and the suppression of either its expression or enzymatic activity increases
sensitivity to As2O3 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we showed
that the combined treatment of hydroxy-PP-Me with As2O3
induced synergistic apoptosis in primary leukemia cells.
Therefore, we hypothesize that CBR1 is an important potential target for novel therapeutic drug development against
diverse leukemias as well as APL.
Figure 7. Cytotoxicity of hydroxy-PP-Me, As2O3, and their combination in
primary human leukemia cells and normal CD34-positive bone marrow
cells. Primary leukemia cells and normal CD34-positive bone marrow
cells were isolated from 3 APL, 10 AML, 10 CML patients and healthy
donors, respectively. These cells were treated with hydroxy-PP-Me
alone, As2O3 alone, or a combination for 48 hours. Cell viability was
determined by an Annexin V/PI assay.

an siRNA that targeted c-Fos and c-Jun. Finally, AP-1 regulated
CBR1 expression by binding to the AP-1 binding site within the
CBR1 promoter. Collectively, we show for the ﬁrst time that
CBR1 is a direct target of As2O3-induced AP-1 activation.
There is a report that As2O3 produces ROS via increasing
expression of NOX subunits (30). In this study, we showed that
the combined treatment of As2O3 with hydroxy-PP-Me further
enhanced ROS production and p47phox and p67phox expression when compared with As2O3 alone. In addition, we showed
that treatment with the NOX inhibitor apocynin and knockdown of NOX subunits diminished ROS production almost to
the basal level in cells that were treated with As2O3 alone as
well as in cells treated with combined therapy of CBR1 inhibitor, indicating that NOX is the main enzyme that produces
ROS under both conditions. Because CBR1 contributes to the
