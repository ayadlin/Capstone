Abstract

Author Manuscript

Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) invariably succumb to metastatic disease,
but the underlying mechanisms that regulate PDAC cell movement and metastasis remain little
understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of the chemokine gene CXCL12, which is
silenced in PDAC tumors yet is sufficient to suppress growth and metastasis when re-expressed.
Chemokines like CXCL12 regulate cell movement in a biphasic pattern, with peak migration
typically in the low nanomolar concentration range. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that the
biphasic cell migration pattern induced by CXCL12 reflected a bias of agonist bioenergetic
signaling that might be exploited to interfere with PDAC metastasis. In human and murine PDAC
cell models, we observed that non-migratory doses of CXCL12 were sufficient to decrease
oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic capacity and to increase levels of phosphorylated forms
of the master metabolic kinase AMPK. Those same doses of CXCL12 locked myosin light chain
into a phosphorylated state, thereby decreasing F-actin polymerization and preventing cell
migration in a manner dependent upon AMPK and the calcium-dependent kinase CAMKII.
Notably, at elevated concentrations of CXCL12 that were insufficient to trigger chemotaxis of
PDAC cells, AMPK blockade resulted in increased cell movement. In two preclinical mouse
models of PDAC, administration of CXCL12 decreased tumor dissemination, supporting our

Introduction

Author Manuscript

With an overall survival of only 6%, pancreatic cancer remains a poorly addressed health
problem relative to other commonly diagnosed malignancies (1). The vast majority of
patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ultimately succumb to metastatic
disease (2). Standard chemotherapies for PDAC provide a minimal improvement in survival
for patients, particularly those with advanced stages of disease. The inability to
chemotherapeutically target advanced PDAC reflects, in part, a current paucity of
knowledge regarding the mechanisms driving metastasis. While data from transgenic mice
suggested PDAC cell dissemination can occur early in disease progression (3), sequencing
and modeling analysis after rapid autopsy of patients revealed that dissemination and
metastasis of PDAC occurs subsequent to primary tumor development (4). Though no
mechanism is known, human tissue analysis implicates the signaling protein Smad4 in
multifocal metastasis of PDAC (5). However the specific extracellular cues that regulate the
invasion, migration, and metastatic homing of PDAC cells into distant tissues have yet to be
identified.

As soluble/secreted proteins, chemokines, or chemotactic cytokines, direct cell movement in
a concentration dependent manner. In normal physiology, chemokines direct cell trafficking
of a wide variety of cell types. Dysregulated expression of chemokines, or their cognate Gprotein coupled receptors (GPCRs), is associated with pathologic cell migration in many
diseases (6). Solid tumor progression has been linked with elevated expression of the
chemokine receptor CXCR4 (7). Recently, we have uncovered epigenetic repression of the
chemokine ligand CXCL12 in colorectal, mammary, and pancreas cancer, in parallel with
increased expression of its cognate receptor CXCR4. Silencing of the ligand enables homing
of CXCR4 expressing cancer cells to metastatic sites rich in CXCL12 (8–10). Subsequent
histopathological studies have also linked diminished CXCL12 expression with worse
prognosis in gastric cancer, osteosarcoma, and breast cancer (11–13). Our more recent study
in pancreatic cancer demonstrated that re-expression of autocrine CXCL12 inhibits PDAC
cell growth as well as cell migration (10). Chemokines such as CXCL12 stimulate migration
in a biphasic manner, with 10 nM optimally stimulating epithelial cell movement and ≥100
nM unable to induce migration (14–18). In contrast, chemokine signaling through the Gαi
protein stimulates intracellular calcium flux over a broader concentration range (e.g. 1–1000
nM) (16, 18). Importantly, the 1–1000 nM concentration range is comparable to
concentrations of CXCL12 physiologically available in circulation and human tissue (15,
19–21). The disparity between these two downstream signaling effects represents a
longstanding conundrum in GPCR function. Lefkowitz and colleagues first observed that

distinct agonists of the same β-adrenergic receptor can elicit different signals and functions
that are either G-protein dependent or β-arrestin signaling mediated, and termed this
functional selectivity as “biased agonism” (22). Thus, as defined by Reiter et al, GPCR
agonists can fall into three categories: G-protein biased, β-arrestin biased, or balanced in
which both G-proteins and arrestin are recruited and signal. A preliminary report by
Lefkowitz et al also showed that the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 could elicit differential
β-arrestin biased agonist signaling when binding to the chemokine receptor CCR7 (23).

Prior reports had shown that, in physiologic solutions, chemokines were capable of
reversibly forming multimeric structures, in a concentration dependent manner (14, 24, 25).
For CXCL12, at lower concentrations the protein remains monomeric, but as the
concentration increases, the presence of dimeric structures predominate (25). These data
lead to the hypothesis that the dimeric and monomeric structures may possess functional
selectivity for the biphasic migration response observed for CXCL12. Subsequently, in a
series of prior reports using engineered variants of CXCL12, we discovered that the unique
oligomeric forms of the ligand can function as biased agonists after binding to CXCR4 (26,
27), with monomeric CXCL12 eliciting “balanced” signaling and migration, while dimeric
CXCL12 stimulated “G-protein biased” signaling without eliciting migration. However,
further investigation into a downstream signaling mechanism to link the lack of migration
with the G-protein biased agonism stimulated by dimeric CXCL12 is necessary.

Recent studies of PDAC illustrate that the there is a shift in metabolic flux toward anabolic
pathways that facilitate nutrient synthesis (28) and that PDAC cells rely on glutamine
metabolism to drive oncogene dependent growth (29–31). However, little is known
regarding the metabolic or bioenergetic profile of migrating PDAC cells. Likewise, though
hormone dependent calcium signaling and cell polarity regulation have been associated with
bioenergetic signaling through the homeostatic regulator AMP-Kinase (AMPK) (32, 33), the
potential relationship between cell metabolism and chemotaxis is unexplored. Herein, we
establish that the decline in chemotactic migration at elevated CXCL12 concentrations
reflects CXCR4-dependent AMPK and myosin light chain phosphorylation (MLC). The lack
of migration at high concentrations of CXCL12 was replicated using the engineered
CXCL12 dimeric ligand. These are the first data demonstrating that receptor activation by a
dimeric chemokine ligand can enhance a specific signaling pathway as a result of biased
agonism. The direct stimulation of a non-motile state by the dimeric ligand we herein have
termed “ataxis”. Broadly, our work unearths an important energy-signaling mechanism
underlying chemotaxis and reveals a viable strategy for pharmaceutical targeting of cancer
metastasis.

were expressed and purified as previously described (27, 35). The CXCL12 locked dimer
(CXCL12-LD) mutations are L36C and A65C and create a dimeric protein. The CXCL12
locked monomer (CXCL12-LM) mutations are L55C and I58C. The engineered locked

Severe combined immunodeficiency mice (cr-Prdkcscid, Charles Rivers Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) were anesthetized and orthotopically implanted with either 106 Panc1 or
MiaPaCa2 cells stably expressing firefly luciferase and tumor formation tracked in vivo by
bioluminescent imaging (Lumina IVIS 100, Perkin Elmer, Alameda, CA) using our
previously published technique (10). At 7 days post-implantation, mice were sorted into
vehicle or treatment groups with equivalent average luminescence and treated twice-weekly
thereafter with 200 μL intra-peritoneal injections of phosphate-buffered saline or 5 μM
recombinant CXCL12 protein. Mice in the Panc1 model were allowed to survive until
humanely euthanized when morbid, in accordance with an IACUC approved protocol, while
MiaPaCa2 xenografted mice were sacrificed on day 70. Ex vivo analysis was performed with
individual luminescence measurements of the liver, lung, and adjacent lymph nodes. The
peritoneal cavity was visually inspected and imaged post-organ harvest to detect potential
peritoneal movement of tumor cells.

MiaPaCa2 cells were first plated overnight in Seahorse plates, and then equilibrated in
unbuffered, serum-free medium containing only 5.5 mM glucose and 4 mM L-glutamine for
3 hours. Prior to the injection of chemokine into each well, eight baseline measurements of
oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were taken and
averaged as a time zero energy measurement. Chemokines were then automatically
dispensed into wells, with 8 measurements taken over 1 hour to determine basal energetic
flux, after which glycolytic and oxidative stress tests were employed using the inhibitors,
oligomycin, dinitrophenol (DNP), and Antimycin A. Stress test inhibitors were injected
sequentially with 3 measurements taken after each individual treatment. Oligomycin was
used to measure ATP-linked OCR and reserve ECAR, DNP was used to measure reserve
OCR, and Antimycin A was used to correct for non-specific flux.
Immunoblotting

Cells were plated to 80% confluency in 60 mm dishes and then starved 24 hours for
transfected cells or 5 hours for stimulated cells. Stimulations were performed in serum-free
medium and inhibitors placed on cells 1 hour before stimulation. After stimulation, cells
were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed using a modified RIPA buffer. Lysates were
normalized for protein concentration, size separated using reducing SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) and then probed using primary and horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized by
chemiluminescence with auto-exposure and quantified by densitometric analysis using the
FluorChem HD2 from Cell Biosciences (Santa Clara, CA). The optical densities of the
proteins in immunoblots from independent experiments were obtained by densitometry.
Flow cytometry

Cells are grown to 80% confluency then lifted using Enzyme-Free Dissociation Buffer
(Invitrogen) and washed twice using cold PBS. Cells were incubated in a 1% (w/v) BSA
blocking solution, incubated for 1 hour in primary antibody on ice, washed twice and then
incubated for 1 hour in fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then fixed in
2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and fluorescence intensity measured on a BD-LSR II flow
cytometer and analyzed by FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as published previously (36). Briefly, cells
were plated overnight at 50% confluency on glass coverslips, serum-starved 2 hours and
then treated. After treatment, cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde, blocked and
permeabilized, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with a phosphor-specific antibody for
MLC. Cells were then washed and incubated with a goat-anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-488conjugated antibody and phalloidin-AlexaFluor-594 for two hours at room temperature,
counterstained with DAPI for 15 minutes, and coverslipped. Microscopy was performed and
fluorescence intensity measured using the Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and software at
600x magnification under oil immersion. Percent of cells with stress fiber formation was
quantified with images blinded for treatment and then scored by a separate investigator for
presence of stress fiber or cortical actin.

CXCR4 depletion

Author Manuscript

shRNA sequences complementary to CXCR4 transcript, sequences 4052 (#1) and 4055 (#2),
were purchased from the Open Biosystems dataset (Huntsville, AL) pre-inserted into the
LL3.7-Puro vector. Mock, Scramble, or CXCR4 shRNAs were cloned into competent E.
coli. Lentiviral particles were constructed by transfecting each plasmid with viral accessory
plasmids, pVSVG, pREV, and pRRE into HEK-293T cells using Mirus reagent (Mirus,
Madison, WI). After overnight transfection, medium was exchanged for harvest media and
cells cultured for 48 hours. Harvested viral particles were then collected, filtered, and stored
for later use. MiaPaCa2 cells were grown to ~50% confluency and then transduced with
harvested Mock, Scramble, or CXCR4-encoding lentiviral particles using polybrene for 24
hours. Transduced cells were then selected using puromycin for seven days, after which
stable protein depletion was measured by both immunoblotting and flow cytometry.
Calcium Flux

Author Manuscript

Calcium mobilization was measured using the Fluo-4-AM cell permeable dye (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer’s directions. Cells were plated to 90% confluency in 96-well
plates and then serum-starved for 2 hours the next day. Cells were washed with Calcium/
Magnesium-free Dulbecco’s PBS, loaded with Fluo-4-AM for 30 minutes at 37°C and then
10 minutes at room temperature. Stimulants, diluted in calcium/magnesium-free HBSS were
then loaded into auto-injectors of the Victor Wallac (Waltham, MA). Background readings
were taken before stimulant injection (3 readings), and then 30 readings every 5 seconds
were taken post-injection with ionomycin as a positive control.
Transwell migration
Cells were grown to confluence in transwell inserts (Corning Costar (Corning, NY). The
upper well of the transwell membrane was coated with Collagen I (15 μg/mL) then
incubated in 2% (w/v) BSA/PBS until cells were ready for plating. Cells were lifted using
enzyme-free buffer, washed, and plated to the upper well, with chemoattractants added to

the bottom well in serum-free media. MiaPaCa2 and MCW512 cell migration (105 cells
plated) was measured after 6 and 4 hours, respectively. Transwell migration was enumerated
in a representative set of images taken using fluorescence microscopy after the upper side of
each well was swabbed, fixed using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and stained with DAPI.
Any functional inhibitors were mixed with cells plated in the top of transwell chamber, with
a pre-treatment incubation time of 30 minutes.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4 (San Diego, CA). Paired
analyses were calculated using a student’s t-test. Multiple comparisons were analyzed using
a one-way ANOVA and either a Dunnett post-hoc analysis or a Tukey post-hoc analysis to
identify pair-wise differences between distinct experimental groups. Statistical significance
was defined as P≤0.05.

Results
Treatment with recombinant chemokine blocks pancreatic cancer metastasis

Author Manuscript

We recently demonstrated that stable re-expression of CXCL12 in human PDAC cells has a
tumor suppressive effect by slowing cancer cell proliferation and mobility (10). Based on
those finding, we hypothesized that, as a secreted protein, CXCL12 would function as a
biologic response modifier of PDAC malignancy. Combining our previously established
pancreatic orthotopic xenograft models with a therapeutic regimen and window defined in
our previous studies using the protein in vivo for colorectal cancer and melanoma (10, 27,
37), we found that mice treated twice-weekly with CXCL12 had less dissemination, relative
to vehicle treatment (Figure 1A–B). Ex vivo luminescence of metastatic destination organs,
including liver, lung, & proximal lymph nodes, showed that CXCL12 treatment significantly
lowered overall tumor dissemination, compared to controls (Figure 1C–D). Notably,
decreased metastasis was separately observed in both the MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 xenograft
models, without any concomitant increase in peritoneal cavity dissemination. These data on
the anti-metastatic effects of CXCL12 mirror our prior report in colorectal cancer and
melanoma (27).
CXCL12 alters pancreatic cancer bioenergetic rates and AMPK signaling

Author Manuscript

One explanation for the anti-metastatic effect of CXCL12 in vivo is that exogenous
chemokine disrupts the concentration gradients necessary for chemotactic migration of
cancer cells. Based on our observation that CXCL12 regulates in vitro pancreatic cell
migration in a biphasic manner, wherein low nanomolar doses (≥10 nM) stimulate migration
while higher doses (≥100 nM) are “ataxic” and unable to evoke migration, we hypothesized
that the change from CXCL12 from a pro- to an anti-metastatic ligand reflected functional
selectivity or biased agonist signaling through the CXCR4 receptor (10). The mechanisms
for functional selectivity of CXCL12 through CXCR4 are unknown. Using a Seahorse-XF
analyzer we first tested the notion that the biphasic migratory response to CXCL12 reflected
changes in energy metabolism. A declining, dose-dependent trend in basal oxygen
consumption and glycolysis rates in MiaPaCa2 cells stimulated with CXCL12was measured
(Figure S1, Figure 2A–B). Significant decreases in ATP-linked oxidative phosphorylation,

basal glycolysis, and reserve glycolytic capacity were observed in MiaPaCa2 cells
stimulated with the ataxic 1000 nM dose of CXCL12, compared to vehicle control (Figure
2A–B). When oxygen consumption and glycolytic rates were visualized together, an overall
declining trend in cellular energy was observed as the concentration of CXCL12 increased
(Figure 2C).

Author Manuscript

We next predicted that CXCL12 dependent changes in cell energetics may be linked to
altered activity of AMPK, a known regulator of metabolic stress. Immunoblot analysis
demonstrated that CXCL12 dose-dependently stimulated phosphorylation at the activating
threonine-172 site of AMPK (Figure 2D). Non-motile 100 and 1000 nM doses of CXCL12
stimulated significant and sustained AMPK phosphorylation through 1 hour (Figure 2D).
CXCL12 regulation of migration and AMPK activity was next tested in a previously
characterized patient-derived PDAC cell line (10). As predicted, patient-derived MCW512
cells migrated in response to exogenous CXCL12 stimulation in a biphasic fashion, with
peak chemotaxis at 10 nM CXCL12 (Figure S1C). As with MiaPaCa2 cells, 1000 nM
CXCL12 stimulated significant increase in AMPK phosphorylation in patient-derived cells
(Figure S2D). Together, these data demonstrate that ataxic doses of CXCL12 stimulate
prolonged AMPK activity in human PDAC cells.

Author Manuscript

To address whether CXCL12-induced AMPK activity was species dependent, we next
acquired a battery of mouse-derived PDAC cell lines and first analyzed chemokine and
receptor expression. RT-PCR analysis showed that 4 of 7 mouse lines lacked appreciable
CXCL12 transcript, 4 of 7 mouse lines expressed CXCR4 transcript, and each line expressed
CXCR7 mRNA (Figure S2A). Immunoblot and flow cytometric analyses confirmed protein
expression of CXCR4 (Figure S2B–D). Of the seven cell lines, FC1199 and Pan-02 most
closely mimicked the expression pattern of CXCL12, CXCR4, and CXCR7 that we noted in
human PDAC (10). Given its novel isolation from the primary tumor of C57BL/6
KRasLSL.G12D/+-p53R172H/+-PdxCretg/+ (KPC) mouse model of PDAC, we identified the
FC1199 cell line as a suitable model for further study. FC1199 cells had increased AMPK
activity in a dose-dependent fashion after CXCL12 stimulation (Figure 2E). Consistent with
the human cell lines, CXCL12 stimulated AMPK phosphorylation was significantly
increased 1 hour after stimulation with 100 or 1000nM, but not 1 or 10 nM doses, in FC1199
cells (Figure 2E). These data indicate that CXCL12-induced AMPK activity is a speciesindependent event.

Author Manuscript

In sum, our observations indicate that CXCL12 regulates bioenergy consumption rates as
well as energy-sensing signaling in a dose-dependent manner. The optimal cell migratory
dose of CXCL12 lead to transient AMPK activity and minimal change in glycolysis or
oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, doses exceeding 100 nM CXCL12, which do not
evoke cell migration, lead to sustained (≥ 1 hour) AMPK activity and decreased glycolysis
and oxidative phosphorylation.
CXCL12 stimulates AMPK through CXCR4 and Gαi calcium signaling
As our previous studies demonstrated that CXCL12 induced biphasic migration is mediated
through CXCR4 binding (27), rather than CXCR7, we asked if the AMPK phosphorylation
stimulated by CXCL12 is dependent on CXCR4 signaling. As a first approach, immunoblot

and flow cytometric analyses confirmed depletion of CXCR4 in two MiaPaCa2 clones
(Figure S3A–B). Transwell migration assays then showed that the control and scramblesequence expressing cells migrated towards 10 nM CXCL12, while CXCR4-knockdown
clones were unable to migrate in response to chemokine stimulation (Figure S3C–D). We
subsequently assessed AMPK activity in those CXCR4-knockdown cells. As shown in
Supplemental Figure 3E–F, at the short time point of 15 minutes, CXCL12 stimulated little
if any AMPK phosphorylation in CXCR4-depleted clones while the scramble transduced
cells ably responded to non-motility-inducing doses of chemokine. We next tested whether
AMPK activation was due to Gαi protein coupled signaling. Consistent with elevated
CXCL12 signaling in a biased agonist fashion, immunoblot analysis showed that AMPK
phosphorylation was decreased after pretreatment with either pertussis toxin (Figure S3G) or
the small molecule CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (Figure S3H). These data demonstrate
that AMPK phosphorylation in response to the ataxic ≥100 nM doses of CXCL12 reflect
activation of the canonical CXCR4-Gαi signaling mechanism.

Author Manuscript

In previous studies, we and others established that, in contrast to the biphasic functional
migration response, CXCL12 stimulates intracellular calcium flux in a saturable
concentration-dependent fashion (25–27). In MiaPaCa2 cells, CXCL12 doses exceeding 10
nM stimulated equivalent maximal levels of intracellular calcium flux with and without
extracellular calcium ions (Figure 3A–D). In patient-derived PDAC cells, 1000 nM
CXCL12 stimulated a significant and sustained increase in calcium (Figure S4A–B). Given
the similarity of concentration dependent change in AMPK activity and calcium
mobilization in response to CXCL12, we predicted that increased AMPK phosphorylation
was dependent on calcium mobilization. Subsequently, the cell permeable calcium ion
chelator BAPTA-AM abrogated CXCL12 or ionomycin-induced AMPK phosphorylation in
both MiaPaCa2 and patient-derived cells (Figure S4C–D).
Prior reports exploring the regulation of AMPK activity have shown that T172 can be
phosphorylated by either the cell polarity regulator LKB1 or calcium dependent calmodulinkinase-kinase-2 (CamKK2). While LKB1 activity was not increased by stimulation with
CXCL12 (Figure S4E), the CamKK2 specific inhibitor STO-609 reversed AMPK
phosphorylation induced by 1000 nM CXCL12 (Figure 3E–F). In total, our experiments
examining CXCL12 downstream signaling in human and murine PDAC cells demonstrate
that AMPK activity driven by CXCL12 is mediated through receptor dependent intracellular
calcium flux and CamKK2 activity.
AMPK regulates the CXCL12 biphasic migration response

Author Manuscript

RAPTOR, the established regulator mTOR (mTORC1) signaling, is a key downstream
target for AMPK-mediated phosphorylation. While AMPK is conventionally thought to
regulate mTOR activity in the context of cell growth, we did not detect any altered
RAPTOR signaling (data not shown), consistent with other studies demonstrating nongrowth related AMPK signaling (33). The repeated cycling of myosin light chain (MLC)
phosphorylation and subsequent de-phosphorylation is essential for the perpetual lever-like
action that myosin exhibits on F-actin fibers, allowing cells to contract, relax, and then
migrate (38, 39). Activation of AMPK has been proposed to affect MLC activity by

preventing the de-phosphorylation that occurs on the regulatory unit of MLC (40, 41).
Mirroring our previous studies in intestinal epithelial cells (36), immunoblot analysis of
MiaPaC2 cells showed that the chemotactic dose lead to peak phosphorylation of MLC at 15
minutes, which then returned to baseline levels by 60 minutes; a similar temporal pattern in
MLC phosphorylation was observed with the migration positive control (Figure 4A). In
contrast, both ataxic CXCL12 stimulation and the AICAR positive control evoked a
sustained increase in MLC phosphorylation over 60 minutes (Figure 4B).

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that differential MLC phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 was due to
AMPK downstream signaling. The AMPK inhibitor Compound C reversed MLC
phosphorylation induced by 1000 nM CXCL12 (Figure 4C). Previous studies indicated that
AMPK regulates MLC by inhibitory phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase 1 (MYPT1)
(42, 43), an enzyme responsible for de-phosphorylating MLC. We thus predicted that ataxic
doses of CXCL12 would activate AMPK and in turn inhibit MYPT1 function. In a time
course, CXCL12 lead to inhibitory phosphorylation of T853 of MYPT1 between 15 and 60
minutes (Figure S5). We then examined the AMPK dependence of CXCL12 regulation of
MYPT1 and showed that compound C significantly reversed the ataxic CXCL12 or AICARinduced inhibitory phosphorylation of MYPT1 (Figure 4D) suggesting that elevated levels
of CXCL12 disrupt MLC activity through AMPK.

We next questioned if the CXCL12 stimulated change in MLC phosphorylation significantly
altered the assembly of cell migration machinery through AMPK. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed that after stimulation with ataxic doses of CXCL12 cells were rounded
with few cytoplasmic projections, consistent with the non-migratory phenotype (Figure 5E).
By comparison, the chemotactic dose of CXCL12 led to more cell spreading, with abundant
filopodia and lamellopodia formation (Figure 5E). Consistent with our immunoblot analysis,
after one-hour stimulation, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that ataxic, and not
the chemotactic, dose significantly increased levels of phosphorylated MLC in treated cells
(Figure 5F). In parallel, PDAC cells stimulated with 10 nM CXCL12 had a higher
percentage of actin stress fibers, while actin in 1000 nM CXCL12-treated cells was
organized primarily in cortical bundles (Figure 5G). Finally, compound C pretreatment of
cells stimulated with 1000 nM CXCL12 reversed MLC phosphorylation, and in turn
increased formation of actin stress fibers and cell spreading (Figure 5E–G).

We then sought to establish a link between metabolism and migration. We first showed in a
transwell migration assay, blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and inhibiting
mitochondria function with our previously established inhibitor Mito-CP (34), that
abrogation of metabolic activity decreased both basal migration chemokine-directed
migration of MiaPaCa2 cells in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 5A). We then
duplicated this result using dual inhibition of metabolic flux with 2-DG and metformin, an
established inhibitor of pancreatic cancer cell metabolism (44) (Figure 5B). Last, we tested
the notion that chemotaxis regulated by CXCL12 is dependent on AMPK activity in a
MiaPaCa2 transwell migration assay stimulated with a concentration curve of CXCL12 in
the presence or absence of the AMPK inhibitor (Figure 5C–D). In the absence of AMPK
inhibition, CXCL12 stimulated a biphasic pattern of migration consistent with our
previously published data (10). However, pre-treatment with compound C completely

reversed the biphasic pattern and lead to saturable CXCL12-induced migration. Importantly,
the introduction of the AMPK inhibitor significantly increased migration at the previously
ataxic doses of 100 and 1000 nM CXCL12, while continuing to permit chemotaxis at the
optimal dose of 10 nM CXCL12 (Figure 5C–D).

Our prior work established not only that CXCL12 exists primarily as a monomer at low
concentrations and as a dimer at elevated concentrations, but that an engineered locked
dimer CXCL12 protein effectively interfered with colorectal cancer and melanoma
metastasis, with increased stability in vivo compared with wild-type protein (27, 37). We
tested whether the biophysical dimeric chemokine mechanism might explain CXCL12induced ataxis through activation of the AMPK bioenergetic signaling mechanism. Using
our previously established engineered mutants of CXCL12 locked in either the monomeric
or dimeric state (27, 35), we first showed that 10 nM CXCL12-LM stimulated migration of
MiaPaCa2 cells equivalent to 10 nM wild-type protein (Figure 6A). As predicted, 10 nM
CXCL12-LD did not elicit significant transwell migration of MiaPaCa2 cells but did
stimulate equivalent calcium mobilization compared to monomer or wild-type protein in
both MiaPaCa2 and FC1199 cells (Figure 6B). Reflecting our observations using 1000nM of
the wild-type protein, CXCL12-LD stimulated prolonged AMPK activity compared to
CXCL12-LM. Further, 1 and 2 hour stimulation with locked dimer CXCL12 resulted in
substantially more phosphorylation of AMPK compared to monomeric CXCL12 (Figure
6C). Finally, we tested the notion that the lack of migration observed in CXCL12-LD treated
cells is dependent on AMPK activity. Using a transwell assay of MiaPaCa2 cells, we found
that pre-treatment with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C reversed the ataxis stimulated by
10 nM CXCL12-LD. Instead, in the presence of Compound C the CXCL12-LD stimulated a
strong migration that was equivalent to that evoked by the same concentration of wild-type
CXCL12 or CXLC12-LM (Figure 6D).
Taken together, these data suggest that the concentration-dependent decline of chemotactic
migration is mediated in part by AMPK. Ataxic doses of CXCL12 prevented
dephosphorylation of MLC by inhibiting MYPT1 function. This loss in MLC
dephosphorylation then prevented the uncoupling of MLC to F-actin, leading to the
accumulation of cortical actin bundles. Thus, concentrations of CXCL12 exceeding 100 nM
require AMPK activity in order to actively prevent migration. These data indicate that the
decline in migration is the result of biased agonism of CXCL12 binding to its cognate
receptor CXCR4. Prolonged AMPK activity was similarly observed with stimulation by
locked dimeric CXCL12, suggesting that this engineered protein has significant potential as
a more stable in vivo regulator of PDAC metabolism and metastasis.

Discussion
The CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axis has been implicated in numerous cancers, including
highly metastatic PDAC, under the conventional model that elevated receptor expression
correlates with malignancy (7). However, this model has not translated to successful clinical
development of CXCR4-targeted anti-cancer therapies, suggesting a clear need for a novel
pharmacological approach. In particular, the mechanism underlying the ability of
chemokines to control directional cellular migration at different doses is not known. The

conventional model for chemokine involvement in cancer metastasis has been overexpression of CXCR4 leading to increased sensitization and passive migration towards
distant tissue sources of CXCL12 such as the liver (45). This current dogma ignores the
potential active role that the ligand CXCL12 plays in modulating cancer. Our work in highly
malignant PDAC extends the current understanding of chemokines in cancer in two
important ways. First, while other recent PDAC studies have focused on the role of
chemokines in the primary tumor (46, 47), our data herein and in a previous study (10),
identify an ataxic, protective role for CXCL12-CXCR4 in metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
Second, though numerous studies have defined shifts in metabolism that occur during
pancreatic cancer cell growth (29–31), our report is the first to observe the changes in
bioenergetic metabolism that occur during pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our data
indicate that CXCL12 can function as a balanced or biased agonist for its cognate receptor
CXCR4, depending on the chemokine concentration. Elevated doses of CXCL12 effectively
activate an AMPK-mediated bioenergetic brake that shifts pancreatic cancer cells into a nonmigratory response. We additionally demonstrate in a preclinical model that CXCL12
inhibits pancreatic cancer metastasis in vivo.

While canonical chemokine signaling occurs through G-protein dependent calcium
mobilization, the precise biochemical mechanisms downstream of chemokine ligandreceptor binding are still emerging. In this study of PDAC, we show that 10 nM CXCL12
stimulates maximal migration (chemotactic) while concentrations >100 nM are unable to
stimulate migration (ataxic). As we and others have shown for a number of chemokine axes
(14, 16–18), over a concentration curve, CXCL12 stimulates migration in a biphasic fashion,
while eliciting intracellular calcium mobilization in a saturable manner. The decline in
chemokine-induced migration at elevated doses has commonly been attributed to receptor
desensitization, but often without a mechanistic explanation (48). Our data reveal a novel
mechanism that explains the lack of migration at elevated concentrations of chemokines
through a biased agonist signaling cascade. Here, we show that CXCL12 dose-dependently
alters glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and promotes activity of the homeostatic
metabolism regulator AMPK. We confirmed that this dose-dependent effect on bioenergetic
signaling was CXCR4-Gαi-calcium signaling dependent. While others have demonstrated
that small molecule GPCR agonists are capable of inducing AMPK activity (33) in a
calcium dependent manner, our study is the first to link chemokines, as soluble proteins,
with downstream AMPK signaling (Figure 7). Further, chemotactic CXCL12 concentrations
induced cycling of phosphorylation of MLC, facilitating the perpetual motion of stress-fiber
actin (Figure 7A) and in turn allowing directional movement (Figure 7C). In contrast, cells
stimulated with ataxic doses of CXCL12 stimulated the AMPK dependent increase of
MYPT1 inhibitory phosphorylation, which blocks MLC phosphorylation:dephosphorylation
cycling (Figure 7B), effectively locking the migration machinery, and preventing cell
movement (Figure 7D). While the role of the alternative CXCL12 receptor CXCR7 was not
explored, we predict that since CXCR7 signaling is G-protein independent (27) it will not
affect AMPK activity. Additionally, as activity of AKT, a known downstream effector of
chemokines, has recently been linked to inhibition of AMPK (33), further study into the
interplay between AKT and AMPK in chemokine receptor signaling is necessary.
Cumulatively, these data support a model wherein elevated concentrations of chemokine

Lefkowitz and colleagues first posited the concept of biased agonism wherein different
ligands were capable of distinct signaling through a single GPCR (22). Importantly, their
more recent study has shown that β-arrestin, a critical regulator of GPCR biased agonism,
also modulates MLC phosphorylation downstream of angiotensin signaling (49). Our recent
work identified chemokine oligomerization as a biophysical mechanism for changes in
migration potential during chemotaxis, and suggested that ligand concentration-dependent
biased agonism could explain the associated changes in signaling (25–27). At low
nanomolar concentrations, CXCL12 preferentially exists as a monomeric protein, while at
high nanomolar and micromolar concentrations and in the presence of binding partners, the
chemokine forms dimeric structures (25, 26, 50). Using engineered mutants locked into each
form, we determined that monomeric CXCL12 was equipotent to the native protein and thus
functions as a balanced agonist. In contrast, dimeric CXCL12 was incapable of stimulating
migration but retained the equipotent G-protein-biased calcium signaling response as wildtype or monomeric forms of the ligand (27). As CXCL12 dimer-treated cells were able to
migrate in response to CXCR4-independent stimulation, we first termed the dimer effect as
“cellular idling” (27). We additionally showed that oligomers of CXCL12 differentially
recruited β-arrestin and stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (27). In this study, we used
engineered oligomeric mutants of CXCL12 to demonstrate that the ataxis of pancreatic
cancer cells elicited by elevated concentrations of CXCL12 is mirrored with locked dimeric
CXCL12. In addition, similar to ataxic, i.e. >100nM, doses of wild-type CXCL12, dimeric
CXCL12 elicited more prolonged AMPK activity compared with a monomeric variant of the
ligand. Thus, these new data establish a mechanistic link between the observed biphasic
regulation of migration by CXCL12 and biased agonism elicited by distinct concentrations
or oligomeric states of the chemokine. These data are the first to identify a mechanism by
which enhanced signaling drives the arrest of cellular migration, which we have termed
“ataxis”, at elevated physiologic concentrations of the chemokine ligand.

Reexamining the role for CXCL12-CXCR4 in the context of biased signaling sheds
important light on chemokine function in malignancy. Under the conventional model, some
have suggested that CXCR4 is a pro-metastatic factor for pancreatic cancer (51), while
others have shown that CXCL12 can stimulate increased activity of the cell survival factor
AKT, implying that the chemokine is a pro-growth factor (52). However, nearly all of those
studies rely upon a single, typically migratory, dose of CXCL12 to examine signaling
outputs and ignore potentially significant functional effects of higher concentrations of
CXCL12 previously observed in vivo (20). Along with our previous study (10), these data
suggest a model for CXCL12-CXCR4 in pancreatic cancer wherein low, chemotactic
concentrations elicit cancer cell movement to distant tissues but locally increased, ataxic
concentrations of the ligand CXCL12 abrogate cancer cell movement through bioenergetic
signaling and cytoskeletal disregulation. Translating this novel signaling mechanism, we
found that systemic treatment with wild-type CXCL12 elicits a similar anti-metastatic effect
against malignant pancreatic cancer cells. Some have suggested that inhibition of CXCR4 is
a strategy for blocking PDAC malignancy (46, 47). However, administration of small

molecule antagonists of CXCR4, such as AMD3100, passively blocks cell movement
through competitive inhibition, primarily by blocking 1 of the 2 ligand binding sites on the
CXCR4 receptor. Given the CXCR4 antagonist binds only one of two necessary binding
sites with micromolar binding affinity, it is perhaps not surprising that AMD3100 failed to
provide clinical benefit in long term treatment of HIV patients (53). Our report suggests that
the CXCL12 protein is an effective alternative to CXCR4 antagonists to inhibit PDAC
metastasis. By specifically eliciting the anti-migratory downstream signaling components,
biased agonist variants of CXCL12 have potential to actively block pancreatic cancer cell
movement. Further study is needed to fully uncover the pharmacokinetics/
pharmacodynamics of this biologic response modifying drug, though extended biologic
therapy for >75 days in our two models of pancreatic cancer herein showed few signs of
toxicity. Future studies must also examine how CXCL12 biologic therapy will modulate the
immune surveillance in the pancreatic primary tumor environment. Lastly, as pancreatic
tumors are rich in GAGs (54, 55), which are known to alter chemokine binding, further
investigation into the in vivo interaction between recombinant chemokine and extracellular
components is necessary.

Author Manuscript

In sum, this work uncovers a biochemical mechanism for CXCL12 biphasic regulation of
migration that links our previous reports in oligomeric chemokine biased agonism (27) and
CXCL12 chemotactic signaling (36). We show that ataxic doses of CXCL12 lead to
incomplete turnover of migratory signaling and subsequent locking of migration machinery
that is bioenergetic signaling dependent. The cumulative findings of our recent reports
underscore the anti-metastatic potential of exploiting chemokine biased agonist signaling,
address the dire need for identifying strategies to target metastasis, and delineate the
importance of future comprehensive pre-clinical studies of chemokine-ligand specific
therapies for pancreatic cancer.

(A) Panc1 and MiaPaCa2 firefly luciferase transfected cells were orthotopically implanted
into the pancreata of immunocompromised mice. At day 7 post-implantation, mice were
sorted into vehicle or 5 μM CXCL12 treatment groups and were injected intraperitoneally
twice-weekly and thereafter until study end. Tumor growth and dissemination were tracked
weekly using bioluminescence imaging. The MiaPaCa2 model was ended at 70 days while
the Panc1 model was performed as a survival study with animal removal at signs of
morbidity. (B) Representative mice with Panc1 implants are shown, with CXCL12 treated
mice exhibiting less tumor dissemination at day 112. (C) Tumor dissemination and
metastasis was analyzed ex vivo and showed that, in both MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 models,
CXCL12 treatment significantly decreased pancreatic cancer cell metastasis. (D)

(A–C) MiaPaCa2 cells were serum-starved and treated with a concentration curve ranging
from chemotactic (10 nM) to ataxic (1000 nM) doses of CXCL12. Upon treatment, basal
oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates (OCR & ECAR) were measured
using a Seahorse-XF analyzer continuously for 1 hour. At 1 hour, energetic stress tests were
employed sequentially, with oligomycin first used to measure ATP-linked OCR or ECAR

Figure 4. Elevated doses of CXCL12 induce AMPK dependent locking of MLC-actin migration
machinery through sustained phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1

Author Manuscript

(A–B) MiaPaCa2 cells were stimulated with chemotactic (10 nM) and ataxic (1000 nM)
doses of CXCL12, along with 1 μg/mL Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA) or 100 nM AICAR as
positive controls, over a time course of 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Lysates were then
collected and probed for phosphorylated and total levels of myosin light chain (MLC)
protein. 10 nM CXCL12 and the migration control LPA stimulated pMLC in a biphasic time
dependent manner, peaking within 15 minutes. 1000 nM CXCL12 mimicked AICAR,
stimulating high pMLC that plateaued through 60 minutes. (C–D) Pre-treatment with the
AMPK inhibitor compound C (Com. C) abrogated phosphorylation of both MLC and
MYPT1 (T853) stimulated by 1000 nM CXCL12 or AICAR at 30 minutes, confirmed by
densitometric analysis. (*) denotes P≤0.05 in comparison of stimulation ± pretreatment with
compound C. n=5. (E–G) MiaPaCa2s, pre-treated with the AMPK inhibitor compound C
(CC), were stimulated for 1 hour with 10 nM and 1000 nM CXCL12. LPA and AICAR were
controls. Cells were stained for pMLC (green) and F-actin (red) using fluorophoreconjugated antibodies. Analysis was limited to contact uninhibited cells that had potential to
migrate. (A) Microscopy revealed that cells treated with 1000 nM CXCL12 or AICAR were

nM CXCL12 or LPA stimulated more filopodia, and more actin stress fibers. AMPK
inhibition lead to increased filopodia and stress fiber formation at 1000 nM CXCL12, but
did not alter vehicle or 10 nM CXCL12 stimulated phenotype. (F) pMLC levels, measured
on a single cell basis using FITC fluorescence intensity per micron, increased upon 1000 nM
CXCL12 or AICAR stimulation, which was reversed with compound C. (*) denotes P≤0.05

(A–B) In 0.5% serum containing media, both basal and 10 nM CXCL12 induced Panc1
migration were decreased in a dose-dependent fashion by a combination of a mitchondrial
inhibitor Mito-CP and the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), mixed with cells in
the upper chamber of the transwell 30 minutes prior to migration (A). A combination of
metformin and 2-DG significantly decreased 10 nM CXCL12 induced migration of

with or without pretreatment with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Biphasic chemotactic
transwell migration stimulated by CXCL12 was abolished in cells pretreated with compound
C for 30 minutes. The 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) used as a positive control stimulated

(A) Transwell migration of MiaPaCa2 cells shows that CXCL12 locked monomer (M)
stimulates migration similar to 10 nM wild-type CXCL12 (WT) and CXCL12 locked dimer

mobilization, measured using Fluo-4, was similar for 10 nM locked monomer or locked
dimer CXCL12 variants in both MiaPaCa2 and FC1199 over a 3 minute time course. Plots
are representative of 3 biological replicates. (C) Using immunoblot analysis, AMPK
phosphorylation was measured over time in FC1199 cells stimulated with locked monomeric
CXCL12 at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Densometric analysis, shown below, confirmed
that CXCL12 locked dimer maintained AMPK phosphorylation at 60 and 120 minutes
compared to CXCL12 locked monomer. (D) In a transwell migration assay, MiaPaCa2 cells
were pretreated ± AMPK inhibitor Compound C for 30 minutes and then allowed to migrate
towards vehicle or 10 nM of wild-type CXCL12 (WT), CXCL12 locked monomer (Mono),
or CXCL12 locked dimer (Dimer). 10 nM wild-type and monomer proteins stimulated
significant migration, while Compound C reversed dimeric ataxis in pair-wise analyses. (*)

Figure 7. Model for CXCL12 biased agonist regulation of migration through AMPK-MLC
signaling

Author Manuscript

(A) In PDAC cells stimulated with chemotactic doses of CXCL12 (≥10 nM), signaling leads
to a balanced cycling of MLC phosphorylation. MLC phosphorylation by MLCK and
subsequent de-phosphorylation by MYPT1 allows MLC to first bind filamentous actin (Factin), move the fiber with a lever-like action, and then re-attach to allow the process to
begin again for further movement. (B) In PDAC cells stimulated with ataxic biased doses of
CXCL12 (≥100 nM), extended AMPK signaling inhibits the activity of MYPT1, leading to
imbalanced cycling of MLC phosphorylation. Buildup of phosphorylated MLC prevents the
lever-like action of MLC and subsequent re-attachment to f-actin; as a result, f-actin fibers
remain immobile. (C) At the cellular level, by 60 minutes of stimulation, chemotactic doses
of CXCL12 induce direction movement through balanced MLC phosphorylation cycling,
subsequent stress fiber actin formation, and filopodia formation. (D) Ataxic doses of
CXCL12 cause unbalanced and high levels of phospho-MLC binding, perimembranous
localization of actin in cortical fashion, and prevent polarized cell contraction and relaxation
necessary for directional movement.
