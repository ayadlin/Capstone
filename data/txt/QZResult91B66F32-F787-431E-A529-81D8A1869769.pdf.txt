Besides its established functions in intermediary metabolism and developmental processes, the nuclear receptor peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor b/d (PPARb/d) has a less deﬁned role in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we have identiﬁed a
function for PPARb/d in cancer cell invasion. We show that two structurally divergent inhibitory ligands for PPARb/d, the inverse
agonists ST247 and DG172, strongly inhibit the serum- and transforming growth factor b (TGFb)-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231
human breast cancer cells into a three-dimensional matrigel matrix. To elucidate the molecular basis of this ﬁnding, we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and microarray analyses, which identiﬁed the gene encoding angiopoietinlike 4 (ANGPTL4) as the major transcriptional PPARb/d target in MDA-MB-231 cells, previously implicated in TGFb-mediated tumor
progression and metastatic dissemination. We show that the induction of ANGPTL4 by TGFb and other oncogenic signals is strongly
repressed by ST247 and DG172 in a PPARb/d-dependent fashion, resulting in the inhibition of ANGPTL4 secretion. This effect is
attributable to these ligands’ ability to induce a dominant transcriptional repressor complex at the site of transcription initiation
that blocks preinitiation complex formation through an histone deacetylase-independent, non-canonical mechanism. Repression of
ANGPTL4 transcription by inverse PPARb/d agonists is functionally linked to the inhibition of cancer cell invasion into a threedimensional matrix, as (i) invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells is critically dependent on ANGPTL4 expression, (ii) recombinant ANGPTL4
stimulates invasion, and (iii) reverses the inhibitory effect of ST247 and DG172. These ﬁndings indicate that a PPARb/d–ANGPTL4
pathway is involved in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and that its pharmacological manipulation by inverse PPARb/d agonists
is feasible.

INTRODUCTION
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor b/d (PPARb/d) is a
nuclear receptor whose transcriptional activity is regulated
by fatty acid-derived ligands. Although its function in lipid and
glucose metabolism, skin repair and macrophage activity is well
established, its role in tumorigenesis is unclear and partly
controversial.1–5 PPARb/d regulates its target genes through
binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs) as heterodimers
with a retinoid X receptor (RXR).4 Genome-wide analyses of
human myoﬁbroblasts have identiﬁed PPRE-mediated repression
as a major mechanism of transcriptional regulation by unliganded
PPARb/d and revealed that only a subset of these repressed genes
is activated by an agonist-mediated switch.6
One of the best-established PPARb/d target genes is angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4).7 After secretion, ANGPTL4 is proteolytically cleaved, yielding N-terminal (nANGPTL4) and C-terminal
(cANGPTL4) fragments both of which circulate through the blood
stream.8 A major function of nANGPTL4 is the inhibition
of lipoprotein lipase,9 which is mainly regulated by PPARs,10
while cANGPTL4 appears to have a role in tumor progression and
metastasis.11

ANGPTL4 promotes the two-dimensional migration of different
cell types in vitro12–15 and can exert pro-angiogenic effects under
certain experimental conditions,16,17 but the signiﬁcance of these
functions with respect to tumorigenesis is unknown. Furthermore,
ANGPTL4 produced by tumor cells is released into the circulation
in response to transforming growth factor b (TGFb), which
increases the permeability of lung capillaries and facilitates the
extravasation of disseminated cancer cells in a mouse model.15,18
ANGPTL4 also inhibits anoikis, which is essential for the survival
of circulating tumor cells.19 Finally, ANGPTL4 expression is strongly
elevated in human clear-cell renal carcinoma,17,20 correlates with
venous invasion in human gastric and colon carcinoma,21,22 and is
part of gene expression signatures associated with distant
metastasis and poor outcomes in humans.23,24 Consistent with
these ﬁndings, several oncogenic signaling pathways have been
shown to converge on the ANGPTL4 gene, including hypoxiainducible factor-1a,25 AP1 (activator protein 1)26 and SMAD
proteins.15,26 ANGPTL4 transcription is also regulated by the
glucocorticoid receptor27 and all members of the PPAR family.9,26
Previous reports have suggested a function for PPARb/d in the
two-dimensional migration of different cell types, including

keratinocytes28 and vascular smooth muscle cells,29 but its
potential signiﬁcance with respect to cancer cell invasion
and metastasis in unknown. In the present study, we have
investigated the role of PPARb/d-mediated transcriptional
repression in cancer cell invasion, with a focus on the PPARb/d–
ANGPTL4 signaling pathway. Toward this goal, we made use of
recently developed subtype-speciﬁc PPARb/d inhibitors (ST247,
DG172; Figure 1a), which downregulate expression of ANGPTL4 by
acting as inverse agonists through an unknown mechanism.30–32
Inverse agonists are deﬁned as ligands that, beyond antagonizing
agonist binding, exert an opposite effect as an agonist. Thus, in
case of PPARb/d, an agonist induces a transcriptional activator
complex by facilitating the association of PPARb/d with
coactivators, whereas an inverse agonist triggers the recruitment
of transcriptional corepressors and thereby the formation of a
repressor complex.

A de novo motif search (MEME) yielded a 17-bp consensus
sequence (AAgTAGGtcAAAGGTcA) that is almost identical to the
direct repeat motif (DR-1) previously identiﬁed in WPMY-1 cells
(AAgTGGGtcAAAGGTcA).6

RESULTS
Invasion of a three-dimensional matrigel matrix by MDA-MB-231
cells is inhibited by inverse PPARb/d agonists
The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 is a wellestablished model system to study cancer cell invasion.
We therefore studied the effect of inverse PPARb/d agonists on
the serum-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells into a threedimensional matrigel matrix using an inverse transwell assay (see
cartoon in Supplementary Figure S1). Figures 1b–d demonstrates
that both inverse PPARb/d agonists ST247 and DG172 strongly
inhibited invasion. These compounds bear no structural similarities (see Figure 1a), suggesting that off-target effects mediating
the observed inhibition are very unlikely. Surprisingly,
the activating PPARb/d agonists L165,041 and GW501516 did
not enhance invasion (not shown), which we attribute to the
complexity of the agonist response (see Discussion).
Genome-wide identiﬁcation of PPARb/d-RXR binding sites in
MDA-MB-231 cells
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition
of tumor cell invasion by ST247 and DG172, we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to identify
PPARb/d target genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Deep sequencing
of DNA from PPARb/d- or RXR-bound chromatin yielded a total
of 20 million reads each mappable to unique locations on the
human genome. Bioinformatic analysis identiﬁed a total of 527
high conﬁdence enrichment peaks (false discovery rate o0.05) for
PPARb/d (Figure 2a, Supplementary Dataset S1) and 37 415 peaks
for RXR (Figure 2a). Peaks for PPARb/d and RXR overlapped at 484
genomic regions (Figure 2a; Supplementary Dataset S1), indicating
co-occupancy of 92% of PPARb/d-binding sites by RXR.
Most of the PPARb/d–RXR enrichment sites (89%) were found
inside or o25 kb upstream of transcribed genomic regions.

Identiﬁcation of PPARb/dregulated and ligand-responsive
target genes
Microarray analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to (i) control or a
previously validated subtype-speciﬁc PPARD siRNA, (ii) the agonist
GW501516 for 6 h or (iii) the inverse agonist ST247 for 6 h enabled
the delineation of subgroups of expression-correlated peaks
(Figure 2a; Supplementary Dataset S2). Out of a total of 178
siRNA-responsive genes, 59 were induced by GW501516, 31 were
repressed by ST247 and 16 were regulated by both ligands.
A correlation analysis of siRNA and agonist responses (Figure 2b)
yielded a similar classiﬁcation scheme as previously described for
WPMY-1 cells6, that is, type I (red): agonist-independent repression
by PPARb/d; type II (blue): agonist-sensitive repression by
PPARb/d; and type III (green): agonist-independent activation by
PPARb/d. Interestingly, genes showing a type II response were
preferentially repressed by ST247 (Figure 2c), supporting the view
that the PPARb/d repressor complexes acting on different groups
of target genes are not identical. PPARb/d-RXR binding to
the ANGPTL4 gene and its regulation as a type II response were
conﬁrmed by ChIP-qPCR (quantitative PCR; Figure 2d) and by
reverse transcriptase–qPCR experiments (Figures 2e and f).

representing metabolic genes with P-values of 0, thus validating
the present analysis. Furthermore, the functional annotation
identiﬁed several groups with a P-value p0.05 that might be
interesting in the context of the mechanistically unresolved role of
PPARb/d in cell proliferation and survival,33 that is, apoptosis,
negative regulation of transcription, signal transduction and
differentiation. By contrast, gene oncology terms deﬁning genes
involved in invasion were not identiﬁed.

Inhibition of TGFb-induced invasion and modulation of the
global transcriptional response to TGFb by the inverse
PPARb/d agonist ST247
As TGFb stimulates cancer cell invasion34 and PPARb/d and
TGFb signaling pathways are interconnected,26,35 we investigated
how a PPARb/d inverse agonist would affect TGFb-dependent
stimulation of cancer cell invasion. As shown in Figure 3a, TGFb
stimulated matrigel invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells, and this effect
was clearly reversed by ST247. We therefore analyzed the global
transcriptional response to ST247 under these conditions. Microarray analyses identiﬁed 107 genes that were induced by a
6-h TGFb treatment, which was counter-regulated by ST247 for
17 genes (Figure 3b; Supplementary Dataset S4). We also

identiﬁed 43 genes repressed by TGFb, which was reversed by
ST247 in 13 cases (Figure 3c; Supplementary Dataset S4). Although
for most of these genes, ST247 counteracted the induction by
TGFb (colored dots clustering near the abscissa in Figure 3d),
ANGPTL4 was repressed even below the basal level expression and
clearly showed the strongest regulation (B40-fold; Figures 3d and
e). Finally, we sought to narrow down the number of potential
target genes that might be involved in mediating the inhibitory
effect of ST247 on invasion. We therefore determined the overlap
of genes repressed by ST247 either under basal conditions (fetal
calf serum (FCS)) or under TGFb stimulation and identiﬁed a set of
61 genes, again with ANGPTL4 showing the strongest regulation
(Figure 3f; Supplementary Dataset S5). This list does not contain
other genes with a known role in invasion, although there are few
candidates that may have a role in actin-mediated signaling,
including genes coding for the ill-deﬁned formins FHOD3 and
INF2, or proteins involved in matrix reorganization, such as MMP9.
However, because of its exceptionally strong PPARb/d responsiveness and its documented role in tumor progression, we
subsequently focused on the ANGPTL4 gene.
Inverse PPARb/d agonists inhibit the induction of ANGPTL4
by multiple signaling pathways
The reported upregulation of ANGPTL4 expression in tumors by
different oncogenic signals led us to investigate whether inverse
PPARb/d agonists might exert dominant-repressive effects. The
data in Figure 4a show that upregulation of ANGPTL4 in MDA-MB231 cells by insulin, 12-O-tetradecanolphorbol myristate acetate,
dexamethasone, basic ﬁbroblast growth factor or TGFb is almost
completely inhibited by ST247. By contrast, PAI1, a classical direct
TGFb target gene lacking PPARb/d sites26, did not show any
detectable response to ST247 (Figure 4b), indicating that TGFb
Oncogene (2013) 5241 – 5252

signaling is intact and does not change under ST247 treatment.
Furthermore, the observed inhibition of signal-induced ANGPTL4
expression by inverse PPARb/d agonists appears to be of general
relevance, as it was also observed in WPMY-1 myoﬁbroblasts
(Figure 4c), in Caki-1 renal carcinoma cells (Figure 4d) and upon
treatment of WPMY-1 cells with the structurally unrelated inverse
PPARb/d agonist DG172 (Figure 4c). By contrast, the irreversible
PPARb/d antagonist GSK378736 failed to show any detectable
inhibition (Figure 4c). Finally, the inhibitory effect on both
the basal level and TGFb-induced ANGPTL4 mRNA expression
resulted in clearly decreased levels of ANGPTL4 polypeptide(s) in
the culture supernatant of WPMY-1 (Figure 4e), Caki-1 cells
(Figure 4f) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4g). By using recombinant full-length and cleaved forms of ANGPTL4, we identiﬁed the
protein detected by this assay as the C-terminal fragment
cANGPTL4 (Supplementary Figure S3).
ST247 inhibits formation of a transcriptional initiation complex
at the ANGPTL4 locus
We next addressed the molecular background of the dominantrepressing effect exerted by inverse PPARb/d agonists. ChIP-based
analyses using antibodies detecting all forms of the large subunit
of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) revealed a decreased accumulation at
the transcriptional start site of the ANGPTL4 gene by ST247 in
TGFb-stimulated WPMY-1 cells (61% reduction; Figure 5a). Similar
results were obtained with TGFb-treated MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 5b) and Caki-1 cells (Figure 5c). These data indicate a
strong inhibition by ST247 of TGFb-induced preinitiation complex
formation at the ANGPTL4 gene. ChIP walking of the ANGPTL4
locus showed RPB1 accumulation along the transcribed region
upon TGFb stimulation of Caki-1 cells (Figure 5c), indicating
transcriptional elongation. As predicted by the lack of preinitiation

complex formation, substantially lower amounts of elongating
RNA polymerase II were detected upon ST247 treatment
(Figure 5c).
ST247 triggers the formation of an histone deacetylase
(HDAC)-independent repressor complex
The repression of target genes by unliganded PPARb/d is
mediated by NCoR/SMRT-HDAC3 corepressor complexes, other
HDACs and SHARP.37–39 We therefore analyzed the role of these
corepressors in ST247-mediated repression. Surprisingly, ST247
had no effect on the recruitment of HDAC3 to the ANGPTL4 PPREs
in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5d; top), although HDAC3 accumulation at the ANGPTL4 gene was seen in Caki-1 cells (Figure 5d;
bottom) as previously reported for WPMY-1 cells.30 This ﬁnding
indicates that HDAC3 does not have a general role in PPARb/dmediated repression by inverse agonists. Consistent with this
conclusion, inhibition of all HDAC subtypes by trichostatin A had
no effect on the extent of ST247-mediated repression in MDA-MB231 cells but attenuated basal repression (Figure 5e). However, the
siRNA-mediated downregulation of HDAC3 had no signiﬁcant
effect (Figure 5f), suggesting that other HDACs may be involved in
basal repression. By contrast, silencing of NCOR1, NCOR2 (SMRT) or
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

SHARP expression by siRNA clearly diminished basal repression
but, surprisingly, did not lower the extent of repression by ST247
(Figure 5f; X4.5-fold in all the cases). Furthermore, although the
simultaneous silencing of NCOR1, NCOR2 (SMRT) and SHARP
completely abolished basal repression, ST247 was still able to
repress gene expression (Figure 5f). These data clearly indicate
that the ST247-mediated repression of the ANGPTL4 gene
is independent of NCoR/SMRT-HDAC complexes and is thus
functionally different from the canonical repression mechanism
used by PPARb/d. PPARb/d protein levels were not changed upon
treatment with ST247 (Supplementary Figure S2), which is
consistent with the conclusion that speciﬁc chromatin alterations
mediate the inhibitory effect of inverse PPARb/d agonists on
transcription.
ANGPTL4 induces invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells and counteracts
the effect of inverse agonists
Next, we addressed the question as to whether inverse PPARb/d
agonists target ANGPTL4 to inhibit cancer cell invasion. Toward
this goal, we ﬁrst analyzed the effect of recombinant ANGPTL4
on the invasion of a matrigel matrix by MDA-MB-231 cells.
As illustrated in Figures 6a–c, recombinant cANGPTL4 increased

the number of invading cells by 80% and was more efﬁcient than
the full-length protein at equimolar concentrations, while
nANGPTL4 had no detectable effect. Remarkably, recombinant
cANGPTL4 also prevented the inhibitory effect of ST247 and
DG172 (Figure 6d), indicating that repression of ANGPTL4
transcription indeed mediates the inhibition of invasion by inverse
PPARb/d agonists, although other PPARb/d target genes may be
involved as discussed above.

Silencing of the ANGPTL4 or PPARD genes conﬁrms their role in
invasion
Finally, we sought to obtain additional evidence for the role of
PPARb/d and ANGPTL4 in invasion of a three-dimensional matrix
by MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Supplementary Figures S5 and
S6, siRNAs against PPARD (si-PPARD) or ANGPTL4 (si-ANGPTL4)
clearly reduced the level of PPARb/d protein in MDA-MB-231 and
the level of cANGPTL4 in culture supernatants. Although si-con
(directed at an irrelevant sequence) had no effect on invasion
compared with untreated cells (Figures 7a and d), si-ANGPTL4
treatment led to a nearly complete loss of invasion (B80%
reduction; Figures 7b and d), conﬁrming an essential role for
ANGPTL4 in this process. By contrast, si-PPARD stimulated invasion
(Figures 7c and d), presumably due to derepression of the
ANGPTL4 gene (Figure 2f). Importantly, in si-PPARD-treated cells,
ST247 had no signiﬁcant effect on ANGPTL4 expression
(Supplementary Figure S8) or invasion (Figure 7e), providing
further evidence for the target speciﬁcity of this compound.

DISCUSSION
A PPARb/d–ANGPTL4 pathway involved in cancer cell invasion
The present study provides strong evidence for a PPARb/d–
ANGPTL4 pathway that modulates cancer cell invasion.
This conclusion is based on several key observations as discussed
below.
First, PPARb/d is linked to invasion as shown by the ability of
two structurally divergent inverse PPARb/d agonists to inhibit the
serum- and TGFb-triggered invasion into a three-dimensional
matrix by MDA-MB-231 cells (Figures 1b–d and 3a). Importantly,
this effect is dependent on the presence of PPARb/d (Figure 7e),
providing strong evidence for the target speciﬁcity of these
ligands.
Second, our data clearly link PPARb/d to the regulation of the
ANGPTL4 gene in MDA-MB-231 cells and identify ANGPTL4 as the
major transcriptional PPARb/d target gene in these cells. This is
demonstrated by unique response of ANGPTL4 to the activating
agonist GW501516, the repressing inverse agonists ST247 and
DG172 and the siRNA-mediated interference with PPARb/d
expression (Figure 2). Intriguingly, the inverse PPARb/d agonists
repress ANGPTL4 transcription and ANGPTL4 secretion not only
under basal conditions but also under the inﬂuence of activating
oncogenic signaling pathways, including TGFb (Figures 3 and 4).
Third, ANGPTL4 is directly linked to invasion. This conclusion is
based on the observations that recombinant ANGPTL4 promotes
invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells (Figures 6b and c), whereas
ANGPTL4 silencing has the opposite effect (Figures 7b and d).
This novel role for ANGPTL4 in promoting cancer cell invasion is

consistent with clinical observations, suggesting a correlation of
ANGPTL4 expression and venous invasion by colon and gastric
carcinoma cells.21,22 Furthermore, in line with our observations,
recent reports have described a function for ANGPTL4 in
promoting keratinocyte migration and wound healing.12,40 After
secretion, ANGPTL4 is cleaved by proprotein convertases into two
biologically active fragments.8,41 We show that only the C-terminal
cleavage product, cANGPTL4, is able to promote invasion when
applied as a recombinant protein to MDA-MB-231 cells (Figures
6a–c). Consistent with this ﬁnding, we show that all the tested cell
lines secrete cANGPTL4 (Figures 4e–f), which is induced by TGFb
and inhibited by inverse PPARb/d agonists. This data suggests that
the observed effects on invasion are mediated by cANGPTL4.
Finally, our data strongly suggest that ANGPTL4 is a crucial
mediator linking PPARb/d to invasion. Thus, the inhibition of
invasion by ST247 and DG172 is prevented by recombinant
cANGPTL4 (Figure 6d), and invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells is highly
dependent on ANGPTL4 (Figures 7b and d). Taken together, these
ﬁndings indicate that repression of the ANGPTL4 gene and
inhibition of invasion by inverse PPARb/d agonists are functionally
connected.
An apparently contradictory ﬁnding is the observation that
PPARb/d agonists do not promote invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells
(not shown), although ANGPTL4 transcription is strongly induced
Oncogene (2013) 5241 – 5252

(Figure 2e). As an elevation of ANGPTL4 levels should enhance
invasion, as seen for the application of recombinant proteins
(Figure 6c), we attribute the inefﬁciency of PPARb/d agonists to
their pleiotropic effects on the transcriptome. Thus, the agonist
GW501516 induces the expression of 234 genes (threshold X1.5fold; Supplementary Dataset S6) after 48 h of treatment, which
corresponds to the conditions of the invasion assay. Among these
are several genes coding for proteins with possible direct or
indirect functions in actin-dependent and migration-associated
signaling pathways, including FHOD3, LCN2, TMPRSS6, ESCSR, CCK,
GRP, TGFA, GLI2 and LATS1 (Supplementary Dataset S6; lines 182,
20, 39, 91 101, 117, 166, 212 and 228, respectively). It is
conceivable that perturbing the balance of such proteins may
interfere with the biological output generated by a single
signaling molecule, such as the stimulation of invasion by
ANGPTL4. Furthermore, some of the effects of GW501516,
including its impact on the cellular ADP/ATP ratio, have been
reported to result from PPARb/d-independent mechanisms,42
which may also contribute to the observed inhibition of
invasion. Similar to our observations with PPARb/d agonists,
previous reports have described an inhibition rather than
stimulation of cancer cell invasion by PPARg agonists,43–46
although these ligands induce ANGPTL4 expression.10,16,26,47–49
It is very likely that this apparent discrepancy is due to the

complexity of the transcriptional response to PPARg agonists, as
discussed above for PPARb/d ligands.
Interestingly, ST247 also affects several genes with putative
functions in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and/or
migration other than ANGPTL4, such as FHOD3, INF2 and MMP9
(Supplementary Dataset S5; lines 18, 42 and 43, respectively). Even
though these genes are repressed to a considerably lesser extent
than ANGPTL4 (Supplementary Dataset S5), it is conceivable that
other ST247-repressed genes contribute to the inhibition of
invasion.
Role of PPARb/d and ANGPTL4 in migration and invasion in
other experimental systems and cell types
The novel role for PPARb/d in cancer cell invasion described in the
present study extends previous reports suggesting a function for
PPARb/d in the two-dimensional migration of different cell types,
including keratinocytes28 and vascular smooth muscle cells.29
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PPARb/dmodulated cancer cell invasion appear to be different. Thus,
keratinocytes with a disrupted Ppard gene have a diminished
migratory capacity,28 although ANGPTL4 transcription is likely to
be derepressed in the absence of PPARb/d as suggested by siRNA
experiments with other cell types (for example, Figure 2b).
Furthermore, we have observed that the MDA-MB-231 cells used
in the present study do not show any signiﬁcant migration
in scratch assays, indicating that the molecular mechanisms
associated with three-dimensional invasion and affected by
inverse PPARb/d agonists are distinct from those regulating
two-dimensional migration.
Our observations are consistent with other published
reports12–15 describing a role for ANGPTL4 in stimulation
migration. One of the best documented example for a
migration-promoting role of ANGPTL4 is wound healing.12
ANGPTL4 speciﬁcally interacts with integrins b1 and b5 on
keratinocytes and consequently activates numerous integrinmediated intracellular signaling cascades, including focal
adhesion kinase, the RhoGTPase RAC1 and protein kinase C,
which may all contribute to the promotion of migration.7
ANGPTL4 also activates 14-3-3s-dependent signaling pathways,
protein kinase C and the transcription factor AP-1, which enhances
keratinocyte differentiation.40 In cancer cells, ANGPTL4 has been
reported to mediate different pro-metastatic effects, in particular,
the promotion of extravasation15 and the inhibition of anoikis in
circulating tumor cells.19 Although the former function appears
to depend on the extracellular interaction of ANGPTL4 with
VE-cadherin and claudin-5,18 resulting in the disintegration of
tight junctions, its function in preventing anoikis is mediated by a
redox-based signaling mechanism.19 This signaling pathway
involves the integrin-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase
(NOX1), which generates an elevated oncogenic O2  /H2O2 ratio.
This, in turn, triggers activation of the SRC kinase and the
downstream PI3K/PKB and ERK (extracellular signal–regulated
kinase) signaling cascades, promoting cell survival.19 However, it
also has to be mentioned that a negative role for ANGPTL4 has
been decribed for endothelial cells, associated with RAF-ERK
signaling.50 However, in this system, inhibition of migration
appears to be due to a speciﬁc biological mechanism, as it
appears to be linked to diminished chemotaxis and decreased cell
proliferation.50
We currently do not know which of these pathways are relevant
for ANGPTL4-mediated invasion and its inhibition by inverse
PPARb/d agonists. ST247 does not cause any signiﬁcant change in
the surface expression of integrins b1 and b5 (Supplementary
Figure S7), supporting the view that its effect is mainly mediated
by decreasing the availability of cANGPTL4 and consequently by
suppressing cANGPTL4-mediated signaling events. Future studies
will have to dissect the complexity of ANGPTL4-triggered signaling
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

cascades in the context of invasion to answer this highly relevant
question.
Although our ﬁndings regarding the role of ANGPTL4 in
invasion are consistent with the published data on its role
in migration eluded to above, they are in conﬂict with another
report51 suggesting an inhibitory role for ANGPTL4 in cancer cell
invasion and metastasis formation in two mouse tumor cell lines,
that is, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) and B16 melanoma.
We therefore tested LLC1 cells in our assays. ANGPTL4 was
repressed by inverse PPARb/d agonists in LLC1 cells (data not
shown) similarly to the human cell lines analyzed in Figure 4.
Invasion by LLC1 was weak compared with MDA-MD-231 cells but
was induced by recombinant cANGPTL4 and inhibited by ST247
(Supplementary Figure S9). Intriguingly, TGFb did not induce the
invasion of LLC1 in the same assay (data not shown). This supports
the conclusion that ANGPTL4 has a central role in invasion, as
the murine ANGPTL4 gene lacks functional SMAD-binding sites
and consequently is not inducible by TGFb.26
The discrepancy to the published data51 may be due to
differences in the experimental approaches, as Galaup et al.
used transfected cells overexpressing ANGPTL4. Under these
conditions, the protein may be differently localized, processed
and/or post-translationally modiﬁed compared with the
moderately expressed endogenous protein or recombinant
ANGPTL4. Furthermore, the effects observed by these authors
did not correlate within the level of ANGPTL4 expression by
different clones, suggesting that clonal variability may have been
involved. The same laboratory also observed an inhibitory effect of
extracellular matrix-bound ANGPTL4 on the migration of
endothelial cells.52 It is possible that in this case a different,
integrin-independent mechanism is involved compared with the
effect exerted by soluble cANGPTL4 observed in the present
study. The relationship between the processing of ANGPTL4 and
its different biological functions is poorly understood and remains
a subject for future investigations.7
Induction of a dominant-repressor complex at the ANGPTL4
gene by inverse PPARb/d agonists
Intriguingly, ST247 and DG172 inhibit cancer cell invasion
triggered by diverse stimuli, that is, serum, where the active
component is probably lysophosphatidic acid signaling through
the PI3K-PAK1-ERK pathway53 and through TGFb signaling via
SMAD proteins.15,26 Our ChIP data (Figures 5a–c) show that these
inverse agonists prevent preinitiation complex formation, irrespective of the binding of activating transcription factors to the
ANGPTL4 gene, such as SMAD3 or AP1 (Supplementary Figure S4),
demonstrating the dominant nature of the repressing effect. Our
data also indicate that these ligands trigger the recruitment of
corepressors to chromatin-bound PPARb/d, such as HDAC3
(Figure 5d). However, several lines of evidence suggest that the
canonical repressor complex containing NCoR/SMRT and HDACs
mediating repression by the unliganded receptor functionally
differs from the complex established in response to inverse
PPARb/d agonists. First, HDAC3 is recruited in Caki-1 cells but not
in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5d), although the latter show a
stronger response to ST247. Second, trichostatin A alleviates basal
repression but has no effect on the repression by ST247
(Figure 5e). Third, the silencing of NCOR1 and/or NCOR2 (SMRT)
derepresses ANGPTL4 transcription, but repression by ST247 is not
affected (Figure 5f). Likewise, knock down of SHARP partially
counteracts ANGPTL4 repression but has no detectable effect of
ST247-mediated repression (Figure 5f). These ﬁndings
suggest that inverse PPARb/d agonists trigger the formation of
an unusual PPARb/d repressor complex exerting dominant
effects on other transcription factors. It will be intriguing
to identify the interacting proteins responsible for this effect in
future studies.

Perspectives
ANGPTL4 has been associated with tumor angiogenesis,
metastatic spread and an unfavorable prognosis in human breast
cancer.15,17–24 One of the compounds showing a strong effect on
cancer cell invasion in the present study, DG172, has the required
pharmacokinetic properties for in vivo applications in mice.31 Our
studies now pave the way to investigate the effect of DG172 in
mouse models of tumorigenesis and to assess its potential with
respect to a pharmacological interference with ANGPTL4-driven
cancer cell invasion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
TGFb2, 12-O-tetradecanolphorbol-13-acetate, insulin and dexamethasone
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), basic ﬁbroblast
growth factor and trichostatin A from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany),
L165,041 from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) and GW501516 from
Axxora (Lörrach, Germany). ST247, DG172 and GSK3787 were synthesized
as described.30–32,36

Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from Caliper Life Science (Mainz,
Germany) (MDA-MB-231-luc2), WPMY-1 and Caki-1 cells were obtained
from the ATCC. Cells were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium; MDA-MB-231, WPMY-1) or McCoy’s A medium (Caki-1)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 1C and 5% CO2.

Three-dimensional Matrigel invasion-assays
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 48 h with ST247 or DG172 (each at
1 mM) or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide; 1:10 000) as solvent control. Transwell
inserts (Thincerts, Greiner Bio-One, Solingen, Germany)) were coated
with 50 ml growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences; Heidelberg,
Germany) at 5 mg/ml and cell invasion was analyzed essentially as
described.54 Brieﬂy, cells were harvested and 15 000 cells were seeded on
the bottom of the transwell inserts and allowed to adhere for 1 h. Thincerts
were inverted and medium, containing ST247, DG172 or DMSO as indicated,
was added to the top (containing 10% FCS) and the lower compartment
(containing 0.5% FCS). Cells were ﬁxed with 8% formaldehyde after 24 h,
stained as indicated and invaded cells were quantiﬁed from six randomly
chosen sections from each thincert using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM
700). ANGPTL4 peptides (Enzo Life Science, Lörrach, Germany) were
imbedded at 2 mM in the matrix and TGFb2 (2 ng/ml) was added to the
upper chamber of the thincert as indicated.

Immunoblotting
Immunoblots were performed according to the standard protocols using
the following antibodies: a-PPARb/d (sc-74517; Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany); a-HDAC3 (sc-11417; Santa Cruz) and a-NCOR1 (No. 5948; Cell
Signaling, Frankfurt am Main, Germany).

ANGPTL4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
ANGPTL4 levels in cell culture supernatants were determined by a
commercial ELISA kit (RayBio, Norcross, GA, USA or Beneﬁcial Solution, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, MDAMB-231 cells were grown to a semi-conﬂuent state, the growth medium was
replaced with fresh medium containing 10 U/ml heparin, and ligands and/or
TGFb (as indicated) were added after 12 h. Culture supernatant was
harvested for analysis 6 h later. WPMY-1 and Caki-1 cells were grown without
heparin. Fresh medium and ligands and/or TGFb were added 2h after
seeding, and supernatants were harvested after 24 h of treatment.

mixed and incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature before transfection. The cells were replated 24 h post-transfection at a density of 1  106
cells per 6 cm dish. Transfection was repeated 48 h after start of the
experiment, and cells were passaged after another 24 h. Forty-eight hours
following the last transfection, cells were stimulated with ligands as
indicated and harvested after another 6 h.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR
cDNA and qPCR were performed as described.30 L27 was used for
normalization. Comparative expression analyses were statistically analyzed
by Student’s t-test (two-tailed, equal variance). Primer sequences for L27,
ANGPTL4 and PAI1 have been published previously.26,55

Microarrays
Microarray analyses were carried out as published.6 Raw and normalized
microarray data were deposited at EBI ArrayExpress. Probes were
considered regulated if they had an averaged log intensity X5, a fold
change X1.2 and replicates were within 50% of each other. Probes were
assigned to genes as described6 using Ensembl release 65. Microarray data
were deposited at EBI ArrayExpress (accession numbers E-MTAB-1098 and
E-MTAB-1262).

ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-Seq
ChIP-qPCR was performed and evaluated as described21 using the
following antibodies: immunoglobulin G pool, I5006 (Sigma-Aldrich);
aPPARb/d, sc-7197; a-RXR, sc-774; a-HDAC3, sc-11417; a-RNA polymerase
II RPB1, sc-899, sc-9001 and sc-56767; (Santa Cruz). Primer sequences were
as described previously.26 Comparative binding analyses were statistically
analyzed by Student’s t-test (two-tailed, equal variance). For ChIP-Seq, ChIP
samples were sequenced on an Illumina IIx Genome Analyzer. Sequencing
data were deposited at EBI ArrayExpress (accession number E-MTAB-1097).

Mapping of ChIP-Seq reads and peak calling
ChIP-Seq mapping and peak calling were performed as described6,56,57
except for updated versions of Ensembl (v65), Bowtie (0.12.7) and MACS
(1.4.0rc2 20110214). The number of usable reads was 19.986.061 (PPARb/
d), 20.033.004 (RXR) and 18.742.013 (immunoglobulin G control).
Peaks were ﬁltered for a MACS false discovery rate p0.05. Peak overlap
Venn diagrams were calculated by building the interval union and testing
each resulting interval for overlap with the initial peak sets. Genes were
associated with peaks using a method based on by GREAT58. Brieﬂy, each
gene received a basal region of 5 kb upstream, 1 kb downstream, which
was extended to either the basal region of the next gene or a maximum of
1 Mb. A peak could thus be assigned to multiple genes. Only the ﬁrst
annotated TSS for each gene was used.

Databases, correlation of ChIP and microarray data and motif
search
All genomic sequence and gene annotation data were retrieved from
Ensembl revision 65 (http://dec2011.archive.ensembl.org/index.html). Signiﬁcance of overlap between microarray and Chip-Seq-derived gene sets with
predeﬁned sets was assessed with Fisher’s exact test. Correction for multiple
hypothesis testing was done via the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. De
novo motif search was performed using MEME (version 4.3.0).59
