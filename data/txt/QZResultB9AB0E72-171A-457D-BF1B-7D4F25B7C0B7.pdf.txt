ABSTRACT
ABCG2 is a potential biomarker causing multidrug resistance (MDR) in NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). We conducted this study to investigate whether
Icotinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, could interact with ABCG2
transporter in NSCLC. Our results showed that Icotinib reversed ABCG2-mediated MDR
by antagonizing the drug efflux function of ABCG2. Icotinib stimulated the ATPase
activity in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the photolabeling of
ABCG2 with [125I]-Iodoarylazidoprazosin, demonstrating that it interacts at the drugbinding pocket. Homology modeling predicted the binding conformation of Icotinib
at Asn629 centroid-based grid of ABCG2. However, Icotinib at reversal concentration
did not affect the expression levels of AKT and ABCG2. Furthermore, a combination
of Icotinib and topotecan exhibited significant synergistic anticancer activity against
NCI-H460/MX20 tumor xenografts. However, the inhibition of transport activity
of ABCG2 was insufficient to overcome pemetrexed resistance in NCI-H460/MX20
cells, which was due to the co-upregulated thymidylate synthase (TS) and ABCG2
expression. This is the first report to show that the up-regulation of TS in ABCG2overexpressing cell line NCI-H460/MX20 may play a role of resistance to pemetrexate.
Our findings suggested different possible strategies of overcoming the resistance of
topotecan and pemetrexed in the NSCLC patients.

INTRODUCTION

G) based on similarities in sequence as well as structural
organization [2]. ABCG2 transporter is a 72 kDa half
transporter which was identified from a doxorubicinselected MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line [3], human
placenta [4], and a colon cancer cell line (S1-M1-80)
[5]. Drugs transported by ABCG2 include a variety of
anticancer agents such as mitoxantrone, topoisomerase I

Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer is a major
impediment for successful chemotherapy [1]. Currently,
48 different ABC transporters have been identified in
the human genome and classified into 7 subfamilies (Awww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Recently, ABCG2 has been recognized as a
molecular marker for the side population (SP) cells [7].
As for human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell
lines, the presence of a Hoechst dye 33342 extruding in
SP cells, which accounted for 0.03 - 6.1 % of the tumor
cells [8], have shown elevated expression of ABCG2,
increased tumorigenicity in mice, and resistance to various
chemotherapeutic agents [9]. Moreover, Yoh K et al. [10]
found that positive immunostaining for ABCG2 appears to
be a predictor of shorter survival in patients with advanced
NSCLC. Recently, a phase III study demonstrated that
pemetrexed/cisplatin was a standard regimen for firstline treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC
[11]. However, some studies reported that ABCG2 also
confer pemetrexed resistance [12,13], which implied
that blocking ABCG2-mediated active efflux function
might substantially contribute to increased response and
prolonged survival rates in patients with NSCLC [14].
Icotinib (BPI-2009H) is a specific small-molecule
inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase, which has shown clinical anticancer
activity in patients with advanced NSCLC [15]. However,
there are still no biomarkers that reproducibly predicted
the benefit of EGFR inhibitors in EGFR wild-type NSCLC
patients, although they only produced a modest benefit in
these patients [16]. In recent years, Gefitinib (ZD1839) and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Erlotinib (OSI-774) have been shown to reverse ABCG2mediated MDR [17,18]. It is conceivable that Icotinib
might also inhibit the functions of ABC transporters
by binding to the drug-binding domain. Therefore, we
conducted this study to determine whether Icotinib could
enhance the chemosensitivity of conventional anticancer
drugs through interaction with ABCG2-mediated drug
resistance in MDR NSCLC. We hypothesized that Icotinib
might enhance the chemosensitivity of topotecan and
pemetrexed in NSCLC.

RESULTS
Effect of Icotinib induced reversal MDR in
various MDR cells
Firstly, we detected the ABCG2 expressing levels
in the cells used in this study. Low levels of ABCG2 were
intrinsically expressed in lung cancer cell lines NCI-H460
and A549 (Fig. 1B). However, NCI-H460/MX20, ABCG2482-R2, ABCG2-482-G2, and ABCG2-482-T7 cell lines
showed much higher levels of ABCG2 expression (Fig.
1B and 1C), whereas the expression level of ABCG2 in
the parental HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cell was undetectable
(Fig. 1C). Secondly, we examined the reversal effect of
Icotinib in ABCG2-mediated MDR cell lines (Table 1

and Table 2). In order to avoid the cytotoxicity of Icotinib
alone in the reversal experiments, the concentrations of
Icotinib we used were 1.0 and 5.0 μM, at which about
85% of cells were viable. As shown in Table 1, NCI-H460/
MX20 cells possessed high resistance to the MX, SN-38
and topotecan that are substrates of ABCG2, compared
with the NCI-H460 and A549 cells. Similarly, the
ABCG2 transfected cell lines ABCG2-482-R2, ABCG2482-G2 and ABCG2-482-T7 also possessed resistance to
mitoxantrone (MX), SN-38 and topotecan compared with
HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells (Table 2). However, Icotinib
at 5.0 μM significantly reversed the resistance of MX,
SN-38 and topotecan in both drug selected derivative
and transfected ABCG2-overexpressing cells, as well as
the intrinsically ABCG2 expressed A549 and NCI-H460
cells, and its reversal efficacy was comparable to the
specific ABCG2 inhibitor Fumitremorgin C (FTC) (5.0
μM). However, the reversal efficacy by Icotinib was not
seen in HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. Meanwhile, there was
no significant difference in the IC50 values for cisplatin, a
non-substrate of ABCG2, with or without the combination
of Icotinib in all tested cell lines (Table 1 and Table 2).

In order to determine the reversal specificity by
Icotinib, we examined the reversal effect in ABCB1and ABCC10-mediated MDR cell lines. As shown in
Supplementary Table S, Icotinib at 5.0 μM did not reverse
ABCB1- and ABCC10-mediated drug resistance in
HEK/ABCB1 and HEK/ABCC10 cell lines. Our results
suggested that Icotinib probably reverse ABCG2-mediated
drug resistance selectively.

Icotinib increased intracellular accumulation of
[3H]-MX and inhibited the efflux of [3H]-MX in
cells over-expressing ABCG2
As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), the intracellular
accumulation of [3H]-MX was significantly higher in
NCI-H460 and HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells than that in
ABCG2 overexpressing NCI-H460/MX20, ABCG2482-R2, ABCG2-482-G2, and ABCG2-482-T7 cells.
Icotinib (1.0 and 5.0 μM) significantly increased
intracellular accumulation of [3H]-MX in both the
NCI-H460 and NCI-H460/MX20 cells, as well as
the ABCG2-482-R2, ABCG2-482-G2, and ABCG2-

significantly increased intracellular accumulation of [3H]-MX in both the NCI-H460 and NCI-H460/MX20 (A) cells, as well as the
transfected ABCG2-482-R2, ABCG2-482-G2, and ABCG2-482-T7 cells (B). The efflux activity of ABCG2 was significantly inhibited by
5.0 µM of Icotinib at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min of treatment in NCI-H460 and NCI-H460/MX20 (C), as well as the ABCG2-482-R2 (D) cells.

482-T7 cells, and its effects were well comparable to
that of FTC (5.0 μM). However, no change was seen
in HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. In order to determine
whether Icotinib could inhibit the drug efflux function
of ABCG2, we examined the efflux of [3H]-MX in
ABCG2-overexpressing cells. As shown in Fig 2 (C and
D), the time course of release of [3H]-MX in ABCG2overexpressing cells ABCG2-482-R2 and NCI-H460/

MX20 was significantly higher than that of the HEK293/
pcDNA3.1 and NCI-H460 cells, respectively. However,
Icotinib at 5.0 μM significantly inhibited the efflux of
[3H]-MX at different time points (30, 60, and 120 min) of
treatment in NCI-H460/MX20 and ABCG2-482-R2 cells,
as well as the NCI-H460 cells, but showed no apparent
effect in the treatment of parental HEK293/pcDNA3.1
cells.

Icotinib as described in supplemental methods. [125I]-IAAP incorporated in ABCG2 band was quantified using ImageQuant software and
plotted as % [125I]-IAAP incorporated ± S.D. (Y-axis) as a function of varying concentration of Icotinib (X-axis). The upper panel shows

Effect of Icotinib on the protein expression of
AKT, pAKT, ABCG2 and the cellular localization
of ABCG2

Icotinib interacts at the drug-binding pocket of
ABCG2
The above data indicated that Icotinib might inhibit
the ABCG2-mediated efflux of the cytotoxic drugs
by binding to the drug-binding pocket of the ABCG2
transporter. To further confirm Icotinib’s interaction
with ABCG2, its effect was evaluated on the photocrosslinking of ABCG2 with [125I]-Iodoarylazidoprazosin
(IAAP) (an ABCG2 substrate) and ATPase activity of
this transporter. As shown in Fig. 3C and D, Icotinib
inhibited the photo-crosslinking of ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50
value of 1.61 μM and stimulated the ATPase activity of
this transporter in a concentration-dependent manner with
a maximal stimulation of 2.54-fold. The concentration of
Icotinib required for 50% of maximal stimulation was 0.14
μM. These results demonstrated that similar to other TKIs,

The expression levels of ABCG2 were examined
to evaluate if Icotinib could alter the expression levels
of ABCG2 and its related prosurvival kinase AKT (Fig.
3A). Our results found that the protein expression levels
of ABCG2 and pAKT were not significantly different from
that in the ABCG2 overexpressing NCI-H460/MX20 cell
line, when treated with Icotinib (5.0 μM) at 24, 48 and
72 h compared with the untreated cells. Furthermore,
the immunofluorescence assay showed that, with up to
72 h treatment of Icotinib at 5.0 μM, Icotinib did not
significantly modulate the re-localization of ABCG2 from
cell membrane to internal compartments in the NCI-H460/
MX20 cells (Fig. 3B).

Western blot analysis was conducted to examine the expression levels of TS and DHFR between the NCI-H460 and NCI-H460/MX20 cell
lines. NCI-H460/MX20 cells were treated with Icotinib at 5.0 μM up to 72 h. The protein levels of TS and DHFR were normalized to those
of GAPDH in the NCI-H460 and NCI-H460/MX20 cell lines. Values are the mean ± SD of 3 assays. Columns, mean; bars, SD; NS, not
significant. C. The cytotoxicity effect of combined serial concentrations of Icotinib (0 - 30 μM) with pemetrexed (0 - 300 μM) in NCI-H460/
MX20 cells. Icotinib (30 μM) plus pemetrexed (300 μM) did not induce more synergistic effect than a combination of Icotinib (10 μM)
plus pemetrexed (100 μM). D. Western blot analysis to examine the expression levels of TS, ABCG2 and E2F-1 when treated with either
Icotinib alone (at 10 μM and 30 μM), pemetrexed alone (at 100 μM and 300 μM), or their combination. The protein levels of TS, ABCG2
and E2F-1 were normalized to those of GAPDH. Values are the mean ± SD of 3 assays. Columns, mean; bars, SD. E. The cytotoxicity
effect of oxaliplatin in the NCI-H460/MX20 cell line. F. Western blot analysis was conducted to examine the expression levels of TS and
ABCG2 when treated with either oxaliplatin alone (1.0 or 2.0 μM), or Icotinib (5.0 μM) and oxaliplatin (1.0 or 2.0 μM) combination. The

the NCI-H460/MX20 cells.

of TS [19]. In our study, oxaliplatin at the non-toxic
concentration (1.0 and 2.0 μM) (Fig. 4E), could inhibit the
TS expression in the NCI-H460/MX20 cells (Fig. 4F). The
combination of Icotinib (5.0 μM) with oxaliplation (1.0 or
2.0 μM) could significantly enhance the chemosensitivity
of pemetrexed in the NCI-H460/MX20 cells (Fig. 4G)

Docking of Icotinib in the homology model of
ABCG2
The highest score docked model of Icotinib at
Asn629 centroid grid of ABCG2 showed the importance
of hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions
(Fig. 3E). The 3-ethinylphenyl ring was stabilized by
nearby residues Leu626, Trp627 and His630 through
hydrophobic interactions. The backbone of Asn629
formed two hydrogen bonding interactions with the -NHlinker (-NH···OC-Asn629, 2.2 Å) and the N3 atom of the
quinazoline ring (N3···H2N-Asn629, 2.1 Å). Quinazoline
ring was stabilized by the side chains of Phe507, Ala580,
Leu581, Asn584, Leu626 and Try627. The N1 atom
of quinazoline ring formed an electrostatic interaction
with the side chain amino group of Asn584 (N1···H2NAsn584, 3.7 Å). The 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9-hexahydro-1, 4,
7, 10-tetraoxacyclododecanol ring was stabilized by
Thr490, Phe489, Val631 and Ala634. The O1 atom of this
macrocycle interacted with the guanidine group of Arg465
by both hydrogen-bonding interaction (O1···H2N-Arg465,
1.9 Å) and electrostatic interaction (O1···H2N-Arg465, 3.0
Å).

Therapeutic effect of Icotinib combined with
pemetrexed or topotecan in vivo NCI-H460/MX20
tumor xenografts
As shown in Fig. 5A and B, treatment with
topotecan as a single agent exhibited a significant
suppression of tumor growth (P < 0.01). The inhibition
rate of topotecan alone was 46.3%. The ratio of growth
inhibition by pemetrexed alone is 8.2%, whereas it was
not significantly different compared with the control
group (P = 0.18). Treatment with Icotinib alone also did
not significantly decrease the tumor weight (P = 0.38).
Strikingly, a combination of Icotinib and topotecan
showed a dramatic synergistic anticancer effect when
compared with either treatment of topotecan or Icotinib
alone. The Icotinib and topotecan combination reduced
the averaged tumor size by 70.5% (P < 0.01). However,
the synergistic anticancer effect was not detected when
the combination of Icotinib and pemetrexed compared
with the control group (P = 0.28). Moreover, the in vivo
therapeutic effect of Icotinib combined with pemetrexed or
topotecan was further confirmed by the flat tumor growth
curve (Fig. 5C). The Icotinib and topotecan combination
caused a slight decrease in body weight, but this effect
was not statistically significant (Fig. 5D). Moreover,
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of the excised
tumors showed that the expression of ABCG2 was not
significantly different among 6 treatment groups (Fig. 5E). 

Inhibition of ABCG2 function by Icotinib did not
sensitize NCI-H460/MX20 cells to pemetrexed
As shown in Fig. 4A, NCI-H460/MX20 showed
high resistance to the pemetrexed compared to that of
the parental cells NCI-H460. However, Icotinib at 5 µM
did not significantly reverse pemetrexed resistance in the
NCI-H460/MX20 cells. Interestingly, the expression of
thymidylate synthase (TS) was significant higher in the
NCI-H460/MX20 cell line than in the NCI-H460 cells.
Moreover, the TS expression was not significantly altered
after treatment with Icotinib (5 μM) up to 72 h. However,
the expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was not
significantly different between these two cell lines (Fig.
4B). Furthermore, when serial concentrations of Icotinib
(0~30 μM) were combined with those of pemetrexed
(0~300 μM), the more synergistic cytotoxicity of Icotinib
and pemetrexed combination was not detected when
compared Icotinib (30 μM) plus pemetrexed (300 μM)
with Icotinib (10 μM) plus pemetrexed (100 μM) (Fig.
4C). More interestingly, Icotinib alone (at 10 and 30
μM) could significantly reduce TS expression, possibly
through E2F-1 reduction. However, pemetrexed alone
(at 100 and 300 μM) could significantly induce TS and
ABCG2 expression. Nevertheless, the expression of TS
was not additionally reduced by Icotinib and pemetrexed
combination (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, previous study had
shown that oxaliplatin could down-regulate the expression

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed for the first time that
Icotinib potentiated the chemosensitivity of established
ABCG2 substrates in ABCG2-overexpressing cells.
Icotinib treatment significantly increased the intracellular
accumulation of [3H]-MX in both the NCI-H460 and
NCI-H460/MX20 cell lines. Moreover, previous studies
have found that the Arg482- to G482- or Thr482-ABCG2
mutation altered substrate specificity [20,21]. Our results
found that like FTC, Icotinib significantly enhanced the
chemosensitivity of ABCG2 substrates in both the cells
with wild-type Arg482 and mutant-type G482 or Thr482 of
ABCG2. Furthermore, Icotinib could not reverse ABCB1, and ABCC10-mediated drug resistance, indicating that
the reversal effect of Icotinib might attribute to its specific
effect on the overexpression of ABCG2.
In human tumors, EGFR plays a crucial role
in the biological behavior of NSCLC [22], and the
4535

Oncotarget

overexpression of the EGFR is associated with the
response to anti-EGFR agents [23]. Pick, A et al. [24]
found that EGFR might exert a post-transcriptional
enhancing effect on ABCG2 expression via the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway, and EGFR inhibitors might influence
ABCG2 expression in EGFR-positive MDCK ABCG2
cells. Moreover, Goler-Baron, V et al. [25] reported
that PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was a key regulator

of subcellular localization of ABCG2 and functional
MDR. Inhibition of AKT signaling pathway might
result in relocation of ABCG2 from the cell membrane
to the intracellular compartment [25,26]. Icotinib is an
inhibitor of EGFR, which might indirectly modulate the
phosphorylation of AKT via EGFR and its downstream
signal pathway, and can further influence the ABCG2
expression thereby reversing ABCG2-mediated MDR.

However, we found that Icotinib neither significantly
alter the protein expression levels of pAKT, ABCG2 nor
stimulate translocation of ABCG2, suggesting that the
reversal of ABCG2-mediated MDR by Icotinib might
be through inhibition of its transport activity, rather
than modulation of the subcellular protein expression or
translocation.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are known to interact at
the substrate-binding pocket of ABC transporters [27]. The
data from photo-crosslinking of ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP
and ATPase activity of ABCG2 demonstrate that Icotinib,
similarly to other TKIs, interacts at the substrate-binding
pocket of this transporter. The concentration of Icotinib
required for 50% stimulation of maximal ABCG2 ATPase
activity was 0.14 μM, suggesting that it has a relatively
higher affinity for interaction at the substrate-binding
pocket of this transporter compared to other TKIs [27].
Furthermore, docking simulations suggested several strong
interactions between Icotinib and ABCG2 homology
model, which was consistent with our experimental
data. Predicted best-docked model at Asn629 grid may
explain its insensitivity to Arg482 mutations. These strong
contacts may be induced by previously illustrated essential
pharmacophoric features for ABCG2 binding [28].
Recently, Yoh K et al. [10] demonstrated that
overexpression of ABCG2 appeared to be a predictor
of shorter survival in patients with advanced NSCLC.
Currently, pemetrexed/cisplatin is a standard regimen for
first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC
[11]. However, some studies report that pemetrexed
is a substrate of ABCG2 [12,13], which implies that
blocking ABCG2-mediated active efflux function might
substantially contribute to increased response rates and
prolonged survival in patients with NSCLC [14]. In
our study, we found that the ABCG2-overexpressing
NCI-H460/MX20 cells showed high resistance to the
pemetrexed compared to the parental cell NCI-H460.
However, Icotinib at 5.0 µM did not significantly reverse
pemetrexed resistance in the NCI-H460/MX20 cells.
Interestingly, we found that the TS expression, which was
another major factor that mediated pemetrexed resistance
[29], was significant higher in the NCI-H460/MX20 cells
than in the NCI-H460 cells, and that in both these cell
lines, the expression levels of TS were consistent with the
expression of ABCG2. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report to show that the up-regulation of TS in
the MX-selected derivative ABCG2-overexpressing cell
line NCI-H460/MX20. In the previous study, Salnikov
et al. [30] found a significant association between the
expression of TS and CD133, which represents a marker
of tumor-initiating cells in NSCLC, and was co-expression
of ABCG2 in subpopulation of NSCLC patients [31].
However, this co-upregulation phenomenon needs to be
confirmed in other ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines, and
the mechanism that mediates both the ABCG2 and TS upregulation still needs to be examined in our further studies.

Until now, no predictive biomarkers to the
combination of EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy have
been identified. In our study, we determined that ABCG2
might be a potential biomarker for the clinical outcome
to a combination of Icotinib with ABCG2 substrates in
patients with NSCLC. To determine whether the reversal
efficacy of Icotinib in vitro could be extended to an in
vivo xenografts model, we investigated the potentiation
of Icotinib on the antitumor activity of topotecan or
pemetrexed in NCI-H460/MX20 tumor xenograft model.
Our results found that the combination of Icotinib with
topotecan markedly enhanced antitumor activity of
topotecan in the ABCG2-overexpressing NCI-H460/
MX20 tumor xenografts model when compared to either
the Icotinib or topotecan treatment alone. However,
the synergistic antitumor activity was not observed in
treatment with Icotinib and pemetrexed, which might
be due to the inefficiency of Icotinib in overcoming the
additional up-regulation of TS in the NCI-H460/MX20
tumor xenografts. In the previous study, Giovannetti et al.
[32] found that Erlotinib and pemetrexed showed a strong
synergism in NSCLC cells, possibly via the combination
decreased TS expression and E2F-1. However, in our
study, we found that Icotinib alone could significantly
reduce TS expression, possibly through E2F-1 reduction.
Pemetrexed alone could significantly increase the TS and
ABCG2 expression. Nevertheless, the TS and ABCG2
expression were not reduced by Icotinib and pemetrexed
combination, which finally led to the pemetrexed
resistance in the NCI-H460/MX20 cells and xenografts.
Furthermore, our results showed that the TS upregulation could be overcome by oxaliplatin, and that the
combination of oxaliplatin with Icotinib could significantly
reverse pemetrexed resistance in the NCI-H460/MX20
cells. Our results suggested the inhibition of both the TS
and ABCG2 expressions might contribute to the ability
to overcome the resistance of pemetrexed in the TS- and
ABCG2-overexpressing NSCLC patients.
In conclusion, the present study showed that
Icotinib significantly reversed ABCG2-mediated MDR
by directly inhibiting the drug transport activity of
ABCG2. Combination of Icotinib and topotecan exhibited
significant synergistic anticancer activity against the
ABCG2-overexpressing NCI-H460/MX20 cells both in
vitro and in vivo. Antagonizing the activity of ABCG2
was insufficient to overcoming pemetrexed resistance
in NCI-H460/MX20 cells and xenografts, probably due
to the co-upregulation of TS and ABCG2. Our study
identified a promising therapeutic strategy in overcoming
ABCG2-mediated drug resistance in NSCLC. However,
the mechanism that up-regulated both the TS and ABCG2
in the MX-selected derivative ABCG2-overexpressing
NSCLC cell line NCI-H460/MX20 needs to explored in
further studies.

METHODS

of Icotinib, pemetrexed and oxaliplatin were added into
the each well. To evaluate the synergistic cytotoxic
activity of Icotinib and pemetrexed combination, serial
concentrations of Icotinib (0 ~ 30 μM) and pemetrexed
(0 ~ 300 μM) were added simultaneously into each well.
For the reversal experiments, various concentrations of
chemotherapeutic drugs were added into designated wells
after 2 h of preincubation with Icotinib, FTC, verapamil
or cepharanthine. Then MTT solutions (4 mg/mL) were
added after 68 h of incubation. The plate was incubated for
an additional 4 h, and then the supernatant was discarded
and 100 µl of DMSO were added to dissolve the formazan
crystals. Cell viability was measured using an OPSYS
microplate Reader from DYNEX Technologies, Inc.
(Chantilly, VA) at 570 nm wavelength. All experiments
were repeated at least 3 times, and the mean and standard
deviation (SD) value were calculated.

[3H]-MX accumulation and efflux assay

Cell lines and cell culture
HEK293/pcDNA3.1, wild-type ABCG2-482-R2,
mutant ABCG2-482-T7 and mutant ABCG2-482-G2
cells were established by transfecting HEK293 cell with
either the empty pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 vector
containing a full-length ABCG2, with coding arginine (R),
threonine (T), or glycine (G) at amino acid position 482,
respectively after selection with G418 and maintenance
in the medium with 2 mg/ml of G418 [21]. HEK/ABCB1
and HEK/ABCC10 cell lines were generated by selection
with G418 (2 mg/ml) after transfecting HEK293 cell
with ABCB1 vector or ABCC10 vector, respectively
[33]. The human lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 and
its MX-selected derivative ABCG2-overexpressing cell
line NCI-H460/MX20 and A549 cell line were grown
as described previously [34]. The wild-type ABCG2overexpressing cell line MCF-7/Flv1000 was maintained
with 1,000 nmol/L of flavopiridol [35]. All cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium (Hyclone
Co., South Logan, Utah, USA), containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and cultured
at 37 °C in the incubator with 5% CO2.

The effect of Icotinib on the intracellular
accumulation and efflux of [3H]-MX was examined in
ABCG2-overexpressing cells as previous described [37].
Briefly, the cells (5 × 106/cells) were resuspended and
incubated in the RPMI 1640 medium in the presence or
absence of Icotinib (1.0 and 5.0 μM) or FTC (5.0 μM) at
37 °C for 2 h. Then cells were incubated with 0.01 μM
[3H]-MX containing medium for an additional 2 h at 37
°C, with or without Icotinib (1.0 and 5.0 μM) or FTC
(5.0 μM), and subsequently washed twice with ice-cold
PBS. For accumulation assays, cells were lysed by the
10 mM lysis buffer (pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100
and 0.2% SDS) and then placed in scintillation fluid.
For the efflux assay, the suspended cells were continued
to culture in the [3H]-MX free medium with or without
Icotinib (5.0 μM) or FTC (5.0 μM) at 37 °C. The aliquots
of cells were harvested at the indicated times (0, 30, 60,
and 120 min), and then washed with ice-cold PBS and
transferred to scintillation vials. The radioactivity was
measured using the Packard TRI-CARB1 1900CA liquid
scintillation analyzer from Packard Instrument Company,
Inc (Downers Grove, IL). [3H]-MX (23 Ci/mmol) was a
product of Moravek Biochemicals, Inc (Brea, CA).

MTT cytotoxicity assay

Immunofluorescence

Animals

The immunofluorescence assay was carried out as
described previously [39]. Cells (1 × 104) were seeded into
the 96-well plate and cultured with medium containing
Icotinib (5.0 μM). After 72 h of incubation, cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 min) after washed
with PBS, and then blocked with the BSA (2 mg/ml) for
1 h, followed by incubation with monoclonal antibody
BXP-21 (against ABCG2) (1:200 dilution) overnight.
Alexa flour 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(1:1000) (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was used as
the secondary antibody. Cell nuclei were counterstained
by DAPI. Immunofluorescence images were caught by
inverted microscope (model IX70; Olympus, Center
Valley, PA) with IX-FLA fluorescence and CCD camera.

Athymic NCR (nu/nu) nude mice, 10 to 15
weeks old and weighing 18 to 22 g (Taconic Farms
(NCRNU-M, Homozygous, Albino color)), were used for
the ABCG2 xenograft models. All animals were provided
with sterilized water and rodent chow ad libitum and
maintained with an alternating 12 h light/dark cycle. All
the experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care & Use Committee (IACUC) of St. John’s University,
and were carried out in accordance with the guidelines
from Animal Welfare Act and The U.S. Public Health
Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.

Nude mouse MDR xenograft models

ABCG2 ATPase assay

The ABCG2-overexpressing
NSCLC
cell
NCI-H460/MX20 xenograft models were established as
previously described [41]. Briefly, NCI-H460/MX20 cells
(4 × 106) were injected subcutaneously under the armpits
region of the nude mice. The mice were randomized into 6
groups (n = 8) when the tumors reached a mean diameter
of 0.5 cm (day 0), and then received treatments as follows:
(a) vehicle (saline + 0.5% Sodium Carboxymethyl
Cellulose (CMC-Na)) (q3d × 6), (b) Icotinib diluted in
saline + 0.5% CMC-Na (60 mg/kg, p.o., q3d × 6), (c)
pemetrexed (100 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6), (d) Icotinib (60
mg/kg, p.o., q3d × 6, given 2 h before giving pemetrexed)
+ pemetrexed (100 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6), (e) topotecan (3.0
mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6), and (f) Icotinib (60 mg/kg, p.o., q3d
× 6, given 2 h before giving topotecan) + topotecan (3.0
mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6). The body weights of the mice were
monitored and the two perpendicular diameters of tumors
(A and B) were recorded every 3rd day, the tumor volumes
(V) were calculated according to the following formula
described previously [41].

Crude membrane protein (100 μg protein/mL) from
High-five cells expressing ABCG2 was incubated at 37°C
with the indicated concentration of Icotinib in the presence
and absence of beryllium fluoride (0.2 mmol/L beryllium
sulfate and 2.5 mmol/L sodium fluoride) in ATPase assay
buffer (50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L NaN3, 2 mmol/L
EGTA, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, pH 6.8) for
10 min. The specific ATPase activity was recorded as
beryllium fluoride–sensitive ATPase activity as described
previously [40].

Photoaffinity labeling of ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP
Crude membranes (1 mg protein/mL) from ABCG2expressing MCF-7 FLV1000 cells were incubated with 0
to 50 μmol/L of Icotinib for 10 min at 21°C to 23°C in
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The photo-crosslinking of
ABCG2 with 3 to 6 nmol/L [125I]-IAAP (2,200 Ci/mmol)
followed by immunoprecipitation with BXP-21 was done
as previously described [40]. Immunoprecipitated ABCG2
protein crosslinked with [125I]-IAAP was resolved on a
7% Tris-acetate gel. The incorporation of [125I]-IAAP into
the ABCG2 band was quantified using the STORM 860
PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics) and the
software ImageQuaNT, as described [40].

The ratio of growth inhibition (IR) described
previously [41] was estimated according to the formula
given below.
