Abstract
The antihypertensive drug amiloride is being considered as a tactic to improve cancer therapy including that
for chronic myelogenous leukemia. In this study, we show that amiloride modulates the alternative splicing of
various cancer genes, including Bcl-x, HIPK3, and BCR/ABL, and that this effect is not mainly related to pH
alteration, which is a known effect of the drug. Splice modulation involved various splicing factors, with the
phosphorylation state of serine-arginine–rich (SR) proteins also altered during the splicing process. Pretreatment with okadaic acid to inhibit protein phosphatase PP1 reversed partially the phosphorylation levels of SR
proteins and also the amiloride-modulated yields of Bcl-xs and HIPK3 U(-) isoforms. Genome-wide detection of
alternative splicing further revealed that many other apoptotic genes were regulated by amiloride, including
APAF-1, CRK, and SURVIVIN. Various proteins of the Bcl-2 family and MAPK kinases were found to be involved in
amiloride-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the effect of amiloride on mRNA levels of Bcl-x was demonstrated to
translate to the protein levels. Cotreatment of K562 and BaF3/Bcr-AblT315I cells with amiloride and imatinib
induced more loss of cell viability than either agent alone. Our findings suggest that amiloride may offer a
potential treatment option for chronic myelogenous leukemia either alone or in combination with imatinib.

Introduction
Alternative splicing (AS), a process that joins different 50
and 30 splice sites of an RNA transcript sequence, is an
important posttranscriptional mechanism to generate diverse
isoforms of RNAs and encoded proteins from a single primary
RNA transcript. Two highly conserved protein families, serinearginine–rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), are essential factors required for
alternative splicing. SR proteins usually bind to splicing
enhancers and activate splicing at nearby splice sites. In

contrast, hnRNPs usually bind to splicing silencers and antagonize the activity of SR proteins. For example, an excess of
SF2/ASF favors the use of proximal 50 splice sites, resulting in
exon inclusion, whereas an excess of hnRNP A1 promotes exon
skipping by the use of distal 50 splice sites (1). In addition to
the relative cellular contents of SR proteins and hnRNPs, the
reversible phosphorylation status of SR proteins also regulates
alternative splicing (2, 3).
Many genes involved in apoptosis have alternative splicing
variants with antagonistic function (4). A well-known example
is the transcript of bcl-2–related Bcl-x, which functions as a
dominant regulator of apoptotic cell death by alternative
splicing to produce an antiapoptotic Bcl-xL isoform or a
proapoptotic Bcl-xS isoform (5). Overexpression of Bcl-xL
inhibits apoptosis induced by erythroid differentiation of
human leukemic cell lines, supporting its link to poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemias (6–10), and highly Bcl-xL
expression is associated with an increased risk of metastasis
and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic treatments in
mammary tumors and multiple myeloma (11, 12). In contrast,
overexpression of Bcl-xS sensitizes human breast cancer MCF7 cells to undergo chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (13),
while inhibition of Bcl-xL expression sensitizes normal human
keratinocytes and epithelial cells to apoptotic stimuli (14).
These observations imply that aberrant regulation of the
alternative splicing of apoptotic genes may be characteristic
of human leukemias as well as solid tumors, and manipulation
of the alternative splicing of apoptotic genes may have therapeutic potential for cancer therapy.

Amiloride, first approved for clinical use in 1967, is a potassium-sparing diuretic employed in the treatment of hypokalemia, hypertension, and edema (15). In this study, we have
uncovered a novel biological action of amiloride, namely modulation of alternative splicing, on human leukemic cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Amiloride was purchased from Sigma and was dissolved in
DMSO to make 500-mmol/L stock solutions. Imatinib was
kindly provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and was dissolved in DMSO to make 16-mmol/L stock solutions. Serial
dilutions were made in DMSO to obtain final dilutions for
cellular assays.
Antibodies
Antibodies were purchased from the following companies:
anti-hnRNP C1/C2, phospho-ERK, Bcl-2, and Bax from Santa
Cruz (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-PP1, Akt, phospho-PP1
at Thr320, phospho-Akt at Ser473 and Thr308, caspase 3, and cAbl from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-p38, JNK, phosphop38, and phospho JNK from BD Biosciences Clontech; antihnRNP A1, hnRNP Q/R, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-xS from Sigma; antiactin, histone H3, and caspase 9 from Abcam; anti-SRp20 and
SF2/ASF from Zymed; anti-A2B1 from Acris; and anti-ERK
from R&D Systems.
Cell lines
The human leukemia cell lines K562, Molt4, and HL60 were
purchased from Bioresource Collection and Research Center
(BCRC), where each cell line had been tested free of Mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, and cellular contamination. Ba/F3
transfectant (expressing Bcr-Abl with kinase domain point
mutations T315I) was provided by Michael W. Deininger (16,
17) and confirmed by DNA sequence determination, drug
sensitivity test, Western blot analysis, and Mycoplasma test.
All cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen
Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioind), 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 1 unit/mL penicillin, and 1 mg/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 C. All cell lines were cultured in the laboratory for
less than 6 months.
Specimen
Mononuclear cells from 4 chronic-phase and 3 blast-crisis
CML patients along with 4 healthy control individuals were
obtained in accordance with an IRB-approved protocol at the
Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital.
Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis evaluation
Cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The
cell pellet was fixed in 70% ethanol at 20 C overnight and
then stained with propidium iodide staining buffer (0.1%
Triton X-100, 100 mg/mL RNase A, 500 mg/mL propidium iodide
in PBS) for 30 minutes in the dark. Data were collected using a
FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and results were
analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).

Cell viability assay
MTT assay was used to determine the viability of treated
cells. Briefly, 10 mL MTT (5 mg/mL) was added into each
culture well after cell treatment for 24 hours with amiloride,
imatinib, or both. After 4 hours of incubation, the supernatant
was removed by centrifugation. DMSO was added, and the
absorbance at 570 nm was determined by a microplate reader.
Each treatment was done at least in triplicate wells, and the
experiment was repeated 3 times.
Protein extracts and Western blotting
Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of cells were prepared
using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents
(Pierce Inc.) as described previously (18). Total cellular proteins were obtained using cell lysis solution (50 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 137 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 50 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmol/L leupeptin, and 2
mg/mL aprotinin). Protein samples were separated by SDSPAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA
and then exposed to the appropriate concentrations of primary antibodies at 4 C overnight, followed by horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody for detection by
enzyme chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Inc.). The intensity of the signals was measured using LabWorks software
(UVP BioImaging Systems).
Reverse transcription PCR analysis
We extracted mRNA from the cells using TurboCapture 8
mRNA kit (Qiagen Inc.), converted it into cDNA using M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed by using specific
pairs of primers (Supplementary Table).
RNA extraction and array hybridization
We used the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) to isolate total
RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions and verified
the RNA quality with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Two
nanograms of total RNA, labeled according to the GeneChip
Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay manual of the
manufacturer (Affymetrix) was hybridized to Human Exon 1.0
ST Arrays (Affymetrix) for 16 hours at 45 C. The hybridized
arrays were washed and stained on a GeneChip Fluidics
Station 450 and scanned on a GCS3000 Scanner (Affymetrix).
Array data analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) P-values and fold changes for
gene expression were calculated using Partek Genomic Suit 6.2
(Partek Inc.). A threshold cutoff was set to FDR < 0.01 and at least
a 2-fold geometric change in gene-level expression between the
untreated versus the 0.5-mmol/L amiloride-treated samples.
The genes with differential expression were sorted on the basis
of gene function using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (19).
We further selected some candidate genes and performed RTPCR to verify their altered expression in amiloride-treated cells.

cancer treatment, we have been searching for small molecules
that may regulate the alternative splicing of apoptotic genes in
various human cancer cells. Choosing Bcl-x and HIPK3 as the
representative for testing various chemicals and drugs, particularly those in clinical use, we found that amiloride exerts a
potent effect on the alternative splicing of these 2 apoptotic
gene transcripts (Fig. 1A and B). As early as 3 hours after the
treatment of amiloride, we could detect an increase of proapoptotic splice variants, Bcl-xs and HIPK3 U(-) with a concomitant decrease in the antiapoptotic splice variants, Bcl-xL
and HIPK3 U(+), which became prominent in 24 hours. Similar
splicing patterns were also observed in Molt4 and HL60 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). However, the amiloride analogue, 5(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), had no effects on
splicing even at doses of equivalent and more potent for

Naþ/Hþ channel inhibitory activity. In addition to K562 cells,
amiloride also exerted a substantial effect in mononuclear
cells from chronic-phase and blast-crisis CML patients
(Fig. 1C). These data suggest that amiloride changes the ratio
of alternatively spliced isoforms through an enhanced utilization of the upstream alternative 50 -splice site within exon 2 of
Bcl-x and also increased exon 11 (U) exclusion of HIPK3.
Interestingly, alternative BCR/ABL splice variants were also
found in amiloride-treated K562 cells (Fig. 1D). All of these
variants were validated by DNA sequencing, and we further
predicted their protein sequence with the ExPASy proteomics
tool. Based on the sequencing results, we found that the
splicing variants 1 and 8 of BCR/ABL are already known as
b3a2 and e1a2 isoforms. Moreover, the chimeric transcript
(b3a2; variant 1) is alternatively spliced into 6 additional
variants (variants 2–7), 4 of which introduce a premature
stop codon. Western blot analysis further confirmed that the
expression of BCR/ABL oncoprotein is substantially decreased
after the treatment of amiloride.
Amiloride affects the expression levels of serinearginine–rich proteins and hnRNPs
Demonstrating that amiloride has the ability to modulate
pre-mRNA alternative splicing, we then asked whether splicing factors are involved in the process. The results show a
considerable decrease in the phosphorylation level and total
protein level of SF2/ASF in amiloride-treated K562 cells

(Fig. 2A). On the contrary, the expression of hnRNP A1 was
highly expressed after amiloride treatment (Fig. 2B). We also
found that hnRNP A2/B1 and hnRNP Q1 were upregulated,
whereas hnRNP C1/C2, hnRNP I, and SRp20 were downregulated by amiloride (Fig. 2C). In amiloride-treated Molt4 and
HL60 cells, we observed a similar decrease in the expression
level of SF2/ASF and SRp20 (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
results imply that amiloride may modify the alternative splicing through dephosphorylation of SF2/ASF and also possibly
by alterations in the expression levels of various splicing
factors.
PP1 but not Akt plays a role in amiloride-induced
alternative splicing
Previous studies have shown that SR proteins are among
the substrates for Akt kinase and PP1 phosphatase, which may
thus act to modify alternative splicing of certain RNA transcripts (20). Our data indicated that amiloride inhibited
Akt activity by dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and
Thr308 (Fig 3A) but activated PP1 by the dephosphorylation
of Thr320 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the decreased level of phosphorylated SR proteins in the cell may result from either
inhibition of Akt kinase activity that catalyzes their phosphorylation or the activation of PP1 phosphatase activity that
removes the phosphate moieties from SR proteins, or both.
With the use of PI3K inhibitors, LY294002, and wortmannin,
we found that Akt inactivation was not responsible for the
dephosphorylation of SF2/ASF or the splicing of Bcl-x and
HIPK3 (Fig. 3C). To find whether amiloride-activated PP1
phosphatase plays a role in regulating Bcl-x and HIPK3 alternative splicing, we pretreated cells with 20 nmol/L okadaic
acid to inhibit PP1 phosphatase activity (21) prior to amiloride
treatment. The results showed that the okadaic acid pretreatment could partially relieve the effects of amiloride on Bcl-x
and HIPK3 splicing in K562 (Fig. 3D), Molt4, and HL60 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3). This partial relief implies that other
splicing factors such as hnRNPs may also be involved in the
splicing process. Pretreatment with okadaic acid could also
relieve the effects of amiloride on the dephosphorylation of
SF2/ASF and SRp20 but had no definite effect on the expression of hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C1/C2. Taken together, these
results suggest that PP1 may in part mediate the effects of
amiloride on the alternative splicing of both Bcl-x and HIPK3
through the dephosphorylation of SR proteins.
Amiloride affects genome-wide alternative splicing
detected by exon arrays
Since amiloride can modulate the phosphorylation level of
SR proteins and the expression level of hnRNPs, we hypothesized that amiloride would have broad effects on pre-mRNA
alternative splicing. Analyzing the 17,800 genes represented in
the "Core" Probeset list, we identified a total of 1,288 candidate
genes with altered alternative splicing. Gene function analysis
indicated that the largest subset (222/1,288, 17.2%) of these
candidate genes belongs to the gene expression category,
followed by other functional categories such as cell cycle,
cellular growth and proliferation, posttranslational modification, and cell death. Three more candidates, APAF-1, CRK, and

randomly selected from 54 genes to further verify the splicing
effects of amiloride. As shown in Figure 4B, distinct alternative
splicing patterns were observed after the treatment with
amiloride. From the results, it is evident that amiloride has
a genome-wide effect on pre-mRNA alternative splicing.

Amiloride induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
To evaluate the functional relevance of altering the splicing
of apoptotic gene transcripts to cancer therapy, we examined
the effects of amiloride on cell growth and viability. The results
showed a substantial increase in K562 cells in the S phase of
the cell cycle after amiloride treatment (Fig. 5A). Also, the
addition of 0.5 mmol/L amiloride in the medium resulted in a
time-dependent increase in apoptotic sub-G1 phase cells
(Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we extended our study to apoptosisassociated molecules and found that amiloride treatment
resulted in a substantial increase in the active form of caspase
9 and caspase 3 (Fig. 5C) and a dose-dependent cleavage of
poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP; Fig. 5D), both of which are
indicative of the induction of apoptosis. To elucidate the
signal pathway of amiloride-induced apoptosis, we examined
the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and mitogen-activated

protein kinases (MAPK) by Western blot analysis. The results
showed that amiloride downregulated the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in a dose-dependent manner and
upregulated the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl-xS (Supplementary Fig. S4A). As expected, the protein expression
levels of Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS were consistent with their RNA
expression levels. Finally, we found that amiloride induced a
dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation levels of p38
and JNK, which are proapoptotic, with a corresponding
decrease in the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, which
enhance cell survival (22, 23), despite unchanged total protein
levels of p38, JNK, and ERK in amiloride-treated K562 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). These results indicate that inhibition of ERK and activation of p38 and JNK may participate in
amiloride-induced apoptosis.
Amiloride potentiates the growth inhibitory effect of
imatinib
Finally, we wanted to see if amiloride can potentiate the
growth-inhibition effect of imatinib, the frontline therapy for
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In imatinibsensitive K562 cells, we found a dose-dependent decrease in
cell viability mediated by imatinib and amiloride individually,
and the combination of these 2 agents produced synergistic
effects (Fig. 6A and B). Notably, the addition of 0.05 mmol/L
amiloride, which does not significantly inhibit the growth of
highly imatinib-resistant BaF3/Bcr-Abl T315I cells, to a range
of concentrations of imatinib resulted in a substantial increase
in the inhibition of cellular proliferation (Fig. 6C). In addition,

388

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

the dose–response curve revealed that amiloride concentrations as low as 0.01 mmol/L could increase the growth
inhibition effect of 16 mmol/L imatinib (Fig. 6D). However,
the combination of imatinib/amiloride did not result in
enhanced toxicity toward Bcr-Abl HL-60 cells (data not
shown). These results indicate that amiloride can both inhibit
the leukemic cell growth and synergize with imatinib to BcrAblþ cells. Moreover, using mononuclear cells from 3 blastcrisis CML patients and 4 healthy individuals, we found that
mononuclear cells’ antiviability response to amiloride is substantially lower in CML patients than in health controls
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Discussion
Amiloride is an inhibitor of Naþ/Hþ exchanger isoform 1
(NHE1), which is the primary membrane transporter used by
cells to regulate intracellular pH (pHi) and cell volume.
When cells are stressed by pH changes, splicing site selection
in several genes can be altered (24, 25). Our laboratories have
previously discovered that an amiloride analogue, EIPA,
while reducing pHi, can increase exon 7 inclusion of mutant
SMN2 transcript to produce normal SMN protein in spinal
muscular atrophy cells (18). Although both amiloride and
EIPA are known to decrease pHi values in K562 cells (26), we
have found in this study that only amiloride has the ability to
modulate alternative splicing, suggesting that the splicing
site selection in Bcl-x and HIPK3 by amiloride is mediated
through some specific splicing mechanism rather than pHi

ASF to hnRNP A1 plays a role in regulating alternative
splicing. Similarly, we found amiloride induced the exon
exclusion of Bcl-x and HIPK3 with a concomitant decrease in
SF2/ASF and increase in hnRNP A1 expression. Many other
splicing factors, such as hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP C1/C2,
hnRNP Q1, and hnRNP I, are also found to be altered by
amiloride. Further studies are needed to elucidate how these
splicing factors participate in splicing sites selection in
amiloride-induced alternative splicing.

pre-mRNA splicing process, we have explored the mechan-

as well as its metabolites is proapoptotic by stimulating the
PP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of RS proteins, resulting in
the formation of the alternative variant Bcl-xS (28). Emetine,

alternative splicing of Bcl-x transcript to produce proapoptotic Bcl-xS through a PP1-dependent mechanism (29). Based
on our results and these previous studies, we speculate that
PP1 may play a key role in modulating the pre-mRNA
alternative splicing and that any molecule capable of activating PP1 might have the ability to regulate the alternative
splicing of apoptotic gene transcripts. Further studies are
needed to verify this hypothesis.
Disturbance of the apoptotic pathway is implicated in
many human diseases, particularly cancer, and failure to
activate this pathway can result in the resistance of cancer
cells to the cytotoxic effects of multiple chemotherapeutic
agents. Therefore, shifting splicing toward the proapoptotic
isoform offers therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.
The splicing of 3 more apoptosis-related genes, APAF-1, CRK,
and SURVIVIN, is found to be altered by amiloride. Apaf-1
functions as an adaptor protein during the execution of the
mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. During apoptosis, cytochrome c and dATP can relieve the inhibitory action of the
WD-40 repeats and, thus, enable the oligomerization of
Apaf-1, which in turn is able to recruit and activate procaspase 9 (30). CRK oncogene is spliced into 2 different isoforms, CrkI and CrkII, and only CrkI is found to promote cell
migration and invasion by PI3K/Akt signaling (31). Survivin
is involved in the inhibition of caspases during apoptosis,
and it also plays critical roles in cell division (32). Although
Survivin splice variants have also been correlated with
cancer progression, these splice variants are irrelevant to
cell proliferation (33). Amiloride also exerts an effect on the
splicing of the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase oncogene, which

results from a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9
and 22 in a hematopoietic stem cell (34). This chimeric
oncoprotein, containing a constitutively activated tyrosine
kinase domain, plays the key role in malignant transformation and triggers CML (35, 36). Therefore, through the
modulation of the alternative splicing of various apoptotic
genes and BCR/ABL, amiloride may play a role in producing a
proapoptosis phenotype with enhanced sensitization of cells
to irradiation or chemotherapeutic drugs, initiating a new
target for anticancer therapies.
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is an effective,
frontline therapy for early, chronic-phase CML patients.
However, the emergence of imatinib resistance points
toward the need to develop novel therapeutic strategies
for CML patients. Combining imatinib with other anticancer
agents is one approach to overcome this problem (37). In
this report, we demonstrate for the first time that treatment
with a combination of amiloride and imatinib synergistically
inhibit the Bcr-Ablþ cell growth. Notably, amiloride could
also resensitize BaF3/Bcr-AblT315I cells to imatinib. These
results provide important in vitro data to support the
hypothesis that amiloride could inhibit the Bcr-Ablþ cell
growth and proliferation and may potentially offer a treatment option for CML either alone or in combination with a
targeted therapy drug such as imatinib. The calculated
amiloride concentration in the renal distal tubule is approximately 3 to 20 mmol/L (38). Although the concentration of
amiloride used in this study is higher than the published
pharmacokinetic data, amiloride still has a significant deleterious effect on T315I cell viability at the concentration of
0.01 mmol/L (Fig. 6D). The concentration of amiloride

Modulating Alternative Splicing in Leukemic Cells

utilized in this study is higher than that typically achieved
when it is used as a potassium-sparing diuretic, suggesting a
higher dosage would be needed for use as a chemotherapeutic agent or adjuvant. Teratogenicity and reproduction
studies with amiloride in rabbits, mice, and rats given 20 to
25 times the maximum human dose have been reported (39).
These overdose studies revealed no evidence of harm to the
fetus or impaired fertility. Moreover, using normal mononuclear cells from healthy individuals, we observed that
amiloride did not have a significant effect on cell viability.
In conclusion, we have discovered that amiloride can
produce a genome-wide effect on the alternative splicing of
various RNA transcripts, most importantly including those of
the apoptotic factors, in K562 leukemic cells. We also demonstrate that PP1 plays a role in regulating Bcl-x and HIPK3
splicing. In addition, the effects of amiloride on Bcl-x splicing
are translated to the protein levels and many other apoptotic
regulators are found to be involved in amiloride-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 7). Moreover, amiloride sensitizes CML cells
including the T315I mutation to targeted therapy drug imatinib. These significant findings may have therapeutic potential for cancer treatment by sensitizing CML cells to apoptotic
stimuli.
