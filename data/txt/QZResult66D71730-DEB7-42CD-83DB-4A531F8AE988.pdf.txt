Abstract
Hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity to detect real-time
metabolic ﬂuxes as a means to measure metabolic treatment responses in vivo. Here, we show that pharmacologic
inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase-A suppressed the conversion of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate to lactate in
murine xenografts of P493 human lymphoma. In contrast, a glutaminase inhibitor reduced conversion of
13
C-pyruvate to alanine without affecting conversion of pyruvate to lactate. These results illustrate the ability to
monitor biomarkers for responses to antimetabolic therapy in real-time, paving the way for clinical development
of imaging biomarkers to monitor metabolic pharmacodynamics. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4190–5. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Many cancer cells are characterized by high rates of glucose
uptake and elevated lactate production. Oncogenes and tumor
suppressors can be directly linked to oncogenic alterations of
cancer metabolism and increased glucose metabolism (1–3).
Glucose metabolism is initiated by glucose transporters and
hexokinases, which result in glucose being trapped via intracellular phosphorylation. The 6-carbon glucose molecule is
further catabolized to 3-carbon pyruvate, which is converted to
alanine through transamination, and to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase for oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle, or to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA). Increased glycolysis has a number of relevant sequelae,
including acid production and the diversion of glucose-derived
carbons to anabolic processes. Besides glycolysis, glutaminolysis, in which glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate
for oxidation in the TCA cycle, provides a major nitrogen and
carbon source for the growing cells. The glutamine skeleton is
also vital for the production of aspartate and other amino
acids.

The tetrameric LDH-A enzyme kinetically favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, a hallmark of the Warburg effect,
and hence is an attractive therapeutic target. Underscoring its
appeal as a target are the high levels of LDH-A that have been
documented in human cancers (4). We have recently observed
that inhibition of LDH-A with a small drug-like molecule, FX11,
curbed lymphoma and pancreatic tumor growth, with the
caveat that there could be off-target effects in vivo (5). We
further documented that an allosteric inhibitor of glutaminase,
bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-diathiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulﬁde
(BPTES), could also delay the growth of lymphoma xenografts
(6). Hence, cancer metabolism as a maturing ﬁeld holds
promise for new therapeutic agents. Currently, the ability to
detect metabolism clinically is largely limited to 18F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of
glucose uptake into tumors (7). Notably, 18F-labeled tracers of
glutamine metabolism are in development (8). Although it is
highly sensitive, PET imaging is unable to dynamically measure
metabolic conversion and is thus generally limited to static
measures of tissue accumulation.
13
C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has long been
used in the investigation of static metabolic processes in vivo
(9). Recently, with the advent of dynamic nuclear polarization
(DNP) techniques, 13C-MRS and imaging can measure dynamics of metabolic conversions in vivo (10). DNP ("hyperpolarization") can increase 13C-MRS sensitivity by 10,000-fold or
more, allowing for detection of 13C-labeled compounds and
their downstream metabolic products in real-time in vivo (10–
12). In DNP, the large polarization of electron spins is transferred to the nuclear spins, enhancing the signal intensities
for subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging. Flux exchange of hyperpolarized 13C label
between pyruvate and lactate is governed by the combination
of: tumor perfusion, membrane transport of pyruvate, endogenous lactate concentration, and LDH activity (13–14). The
principal drawback of DNP is the short spin-lattice relaxation

Evaluation of LDH-A and Glutaminase Inhibition

time (T1) that leads to polarization decay. Notably, the T1 of
[1-13C] pyruvate is about 30 to 40 seconds in vivo, which is
sufﬁcient to measure metabolic interconversion. The signal is
observable for 5 times as long as the T1, meaning that the
pyruvate signal is visible approximately within 2 to 3 minutes
post injection. Several orders of magnitude enhancement of
the NMR signal, combined with the long T1 relaxation time,
make this a promising technique for hyperpolarizing tracers
with potential applications in medical imaging.
In the present study, we report that 13C MRS can assess the
metabolic conversion of lactate from pyruvate and consequently evaluate the in vivo efﬁcacy of a LDH-A inhibitor
(FX11) in cancer treatment. We monitored the dynamic conversion of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate to lactate and
detected responses of tumors to FX11 treatment aimed at inhibiting LDH-A. Inhibition of glutaminase with BPTES, which
could also curb tumor growth, did not affect the conversion of
pyruvate to lactate and was comparable with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control–treated tumors. BPTES did, however, reduce the conversion of [1-13C]-pyruvate to alanine, which
was also observable in these dynamic scans. FX11 had no
signiﬁcant effect on pyruvate-to-alanine conversion. Our studies establish for the ﬁrst time the use of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate to distinguish the responses of tumors to inhibition
of LDH-A and glutaminase relative to vehicle controls.

Materials and Methods
Animal studies
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with
the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(Bethesda, MD) and were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of South Florida
(Tampa, FL), which regulates animal care and use at the Mofﬁtt
Cancer Center (Tampa, FL). To generate the xenograft model,
2.0  107 P493 human lymphoma B cells were injected subcutaneously into male severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice
(National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) as previously
described (5). When the tumor volume reached about 700
mm3 (within 3–4 weeks), mice were injected daily with control
2% (v/v) DMSO or 42 mg of FX11 (2.1 mg/kg bodyweight) and
200 mg (10 mg/kg bodyweight) of BPTES via intraperitoneal
injection to monitor therapy response. Tumor volumes were
calculated using the following formula: [length (mm)  width
(mm)  width (mm)  0.52].
To prepare mice for 13C-MRS studies, a jugular catheter was
surgically implanted to facilitate injections. The jugular vein,
rather than tail vein, was used for MRS experiments as it
accommodates larger injectate volumes (up to 0.5 mL compared with 0.2 mL), and multiple injections in tail veins of the
same animal were associated with a high failure rate. Jugular
vein catheterization allowed multiple injections over a week
for therapy response study. The tumors were treated with FX11
or BPTES for 7 days, whereas the control group received DMSO.
13
C-MRS acquisitions continued every 24 hours for a week.
For the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/MRS studies,
mice were induced with isoﬂuorane in a plastic anesthesia
chamber with scavenging. Once unconscious, they were placed
in a mouse-speciﬁc holder within the MRI coil, outﬁtted with a

www.aacrjournals.org

mouse-speciﬁc nose cone inhalant anesthesia and scavenging
system for imaging. This system also contained a pad for
respiration monitoring, an endorectal ﬁber optic temperature
monitoring probe, and a heated pad for maintaining core body
temperature at 37 C.
Pyruvate polarization and injection procedures
Experiments were carried out using 30 mL [1-13C]-labeled
pyruvic acid (Cambridge Isotope Labs; http://www.isotope.
com) containing 15 mmol/L trityl radical OX63 (GE Healthcare), Gd2þ-dotarem (Guerbet; http://www.guerbet-us.com) at
1.4 K and a 3.35 T ﬁeld strength and was hyperpolarized for an
hour at 94.082 GHz microwaves using an Oxford Instruments
DNP polarizer (HyperSense). Before the injection into the
mouse via jugular vein catheter, the polarized substrate was
quickly dissolved in Tris/ETDA and NaOH at 37 C, yielding 80
mmol/L pyruvate at physiologic pH. At the start of each
dynamic 13C-MRS scan, 350 mL of the hyperpolarized pyruvate
was injected over a period of 12 to 15 seconds. The injection
was immediately followed by a 100 mL saline ﬂush to clear the
pyruvate solution from the tubing.
In vivo 13C-MRS
All 13C spectra were acquired using a 7 T, 31 cm horizontal
bore magnet (Agilent) using a 35 mm dual tuned 1H-13C volume
coil (M2M; http://www.m2mimaging.com). Anatomic reference images to determine location and size of the xenograft
tumors were acquired with T2-weighted FSE (fast spin echo)
multislice (TR ¼ 4 seconds, TE ¼ 60 ms, echo train length ¼ 8,
matrix 128  128, slice thickness ¼ 1 mm, 15 slices). In vivo data
acquisition started immediately before the pyruvate injection
with a repetition time (TR) of 1 second and ﬂip angle 9o and
single transient spectra were acquired over a period of 150
seconds from a 6 mm thick tumor slice oriented at an oblique
angle to acquire signal from tumor.
Statistical analysis
Values reported are means  SD. Statistical signiﬁcance
between the control and treatment groups was assessed by
using a 2-sample t test assuming unequal variances. Signiﬁcant
differences were assessed by using a paired 2-sample t test for
means. Statistical signiﬁcance was considered at the P < 0.05
level.

Results
The conversion of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate to lactate
was monitored with MRS to assess the response of human P493
B cell lymphoma xenografts to FX11, an inhibitor of LDH-A, or
to BPTES, an inhibitor of glutaminase. Tumor xenografts were
established and animals were treated with DMSO vehicle or
drug via intraperitoneal injection. Fig. 1A and B show relevant
metabolic pathways and the 13C-MR spectrum obtained from a
6 mm thick slice across the tumor after hyperpolarized pyruvate injection, respectively. It displays the prominent peak of
pyruvate (171 ppm) and its conversion by LDH to lactate (183
ppm) along with its conversion by glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) to alanine (176 ppm). Pyruvate hydrate (179
ppm) is formed nonenzymatically in solution and is in

considered to be a drug therapy response marker in this study.
The Lac/Pyr ﬂux ratio was calculated from area under the
curve (regarded as a "Model-Free" approach) of the metabolic
proﬁle from the dynamic scan. The Lac/Pyr ﬂux ratios of FX11treated tumors were compared with DMSO-treated tumors at
different treatment days to assess the response to therapy. The

(Fig. 1D). There is an overall signal decay due to T1 relaxation of
the hyperpolarized substrate. Fig. 2A and B document the

conﬁrming the FX11 drug response (Fig. 2C). We have also
evaluated the conversion rate constants (kp ¼ pyruvate-tolactate and kL ¼ lactate-to-pyruvate) using two-site exchange
model (14). The ratio of rate constants (kp/kL) decreases with
FX11 treatment and increases in DMSO-treated tumors (Table
1). The tumor volume was monitored during the treatment
time window using T2-weighted MRI. Although there is a slight
growth of tumor in all groups (Fig. 2D), no signiﬁcant differences in tumor volumes between groups were observed.
To test the speciﬁcity of the hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate
in the assessment of LDH-A inhibition in vivo, we used BPTES, a
glutaminase inhibitor, which has previously been observed to
reduce growth of P493 tumor xenografts (6). BPTES did not
affect in vivo pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, and the Lac/Pyr
ratio was compared with DMSO-treated control as shown
in Fig. 2C. BPTES inhibits the conversion of glutamine to
glutamate in tumor cells (15). Because the resulting glutamate
is a substrate for the transamination of pyruvate to alanine by
GPT (Fig. 1A), we sought to determine whether hyperpolarized

[1-13C]-pyruvate conversion to alanine might be diminished by
BPTES. In this regard, the BPTES-treated animals had a
reduced pyruvate-to-alanine conversion compared with controls (Fig. 3A–D). Figure 4A illustrates the signiﬁcant (P < 0.001)
reduction of alanine-to-pyruvate (Ala/Pyr) ﬂux ratio by BPTES
in replicated experiments. The Ala/Pyr ﬂux ratio, however, was
not signiﬁcantly (P ¼ 0.112) diminished by FX11 (Fig. 4B).
These data represent the ﬁrst use of the pyruvate-to-alanine
conversion ﬂux ratio and document an effect of BPTES in vivo.

Discussion
The resurgence of interest in cancer metabolism has
increased expectations for targeting speciﬁc metabolic pathways in cancers. Advances in molecular metabolic imaging
have emerged with new tools to measure tumor metabolism in
situ. Hence, we sought to provide a proof-of-concept that
hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate MRS could be deployed as an
imaging biomarker of therapeutic response to inhibition of
LDH and/or glutaminase in lymphoma tumor xenografts.

Notably, 13C-MRS imaging involves no ionizing radiation and,
because it is a multispectral modality, it has the ability to detect
simultaneously the metabolic ﬂuxes of a variety of substrates
(16). The conversion of hyperpolarized 13C-labeled pyruvate to
lactate or alanine provides a noninvasive method for assessing
directly LDH and indirectly glutaminase activities in vivo
within the same acquisition.
In this study, we document that P493 lymphoma xenografts
displayed high levels of native 13C-pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, consistent with the ﬁndings in previous studies of mouse
lymphoma xenografts, and other tumor models (14, 17–19).
The LDH-A inhibitor FX11, but not the glutaminase inhibitor
BPTES, diminished the conversion of 13C-pyruvate to lactate,
suggesting that 13C-pyruvate-to-lactate conversion could serve
as a biomarker of LDH-A inhibition. This may be a generalized
response biomarker, however, as decreased pyruvate-to-lactate conversion has also been observed in response to etoposide in murine lymphoma, apparently through a different
mechanism (14). Etoposide was reported to induce apoptosis
and necrosis, leading to PARP-mediated depletion of the
coenzyme NADH pool and consequently to a decrease in the
apparent pyruvate-to-lactate ﬂux through LDH (14). Steadystate lactate levels in MR spectra have also been observed to
decrease within 1 to 3 days of chemotherapy or radiotherapy of
murine models of sarcoma (RIF-1) and breast cancer (EMT6;
ref. 20). In the current study, the speciﬁcity of the FX11
response was substantiated by a lack of effect of BPTES on
pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. However, while our studies
showed a selective alteration of Lac/Pyr ﬂux ratio by FX11
versus BPTES, these other studies offer a cautionary note about
other mechanisms leading to altered lactate production after
treatment. Although BPTES was observed to not affect conversion of pyruvate to lactate, it was observed to reduce the
conversion of pyruvate to alanine as shown in Fig. 3A–D,
presumably through deprivation of the glutamate pool. This
documents for the ﬁrst time, the potential use of Ala/Pyr ﬂux
ratio, to monitor glutaminase inhibition in vivo.
The current use of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate MR to study
tumor xenografts in vivo has shown the ability of this technique
to examine living animals serially throughout the course of a
disease and its response to different therapies. This work has
shown the potential for hyperpolarized 13C-MRS to follow

metabolic pathway ﬂuxes in vivo, noninvasively, particularly
to monitor and understand metabolically targeted cancer
therapies, which are likely to emerge clinically in the next
several years.

Conclusion
This study documents that the metabolic consequences of
treatment with an LDH-A inhibitor in lymphoma can be
detected by monitoring the diminished pyruvate-to-lactate
conversion in vivo using hyperpolarized 13C-MRS. It also
documents for the ﬁrst time the use of pyruvate-to-alanine
conversion as a pharmacodynamic marker of glutaminase
inhibition. Our results indicate that monitoring aerobic glycolysis using 13C-MRS with hyperpolarized pyruvate is a promising technique that could potentially detect the molecular
effect of various emerging therapies that target cell signaling
and metabolism, and thus provide a radiation-free method to
assess tumor response longitudinally.
