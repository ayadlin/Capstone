ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor in
adults despite contemporary gold-standard first-line treatment strategies. This
type of tumor recurs in virtually all patients and no commonly accepted standard
treatment exists for the recurrent disease. Therefore, advances in all scientific and
clinical aspects of GBM are urgently needed. Epigenetic mechanisms are one of the
major factors contributing to the pathogenesis of cancers, including glioblastoma.
Epigenetic modulators that regulate gene expression by altering the epigenome and
non-histone proteins are being exploited as therapeutic drug targets. Over the last
decade, numerous preclinical and clinical studies on histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibitors have shown promising results in various cancers. This article provides
an overview of the anticancer mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors and the role of HDAC
isoforms in GBM. We also summarize current knowledge on HDAC inhibitors on the
basis of preclinical studies and emerging clinical data.

INTRODUCTION

including enhanced proliferation, invasion and migration,
angiogenesis, and resistance to apoptosis, are targeted
by HDAC inhibitors. The HDAC inhibitors vorinostat,
panobinostat, valproic acid (VPA), and entinostat are wellstudied epigenetic agents that effectively radiosensitize
various tumors, including GBM [7]. HDAC inhibitor is
among the successful examples of epigenetic therapy.
Several HDAC inhibitors are US FDA approved, including
the hydroxamic acid-based compounds vorinostat,
panobinostat, belinostat, and the depsipeptide romidepsin
for hematological malignancies [8]. Vorinostat [9-12] and
VPA [13] are currently being tested in clinical trials on
GBM as either monotherapies or combination therapies.
The other FDA-approved epigenetic drugs, azacytidine
and decitabine, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors [14],
have not been clinically tested to evaluate its anticancer
effect on GBM. Although drugs targeting histone
methyltransferases and demethylases have considerable
potential, their specific effects and the stability of such
effect must be elucidated in greater detail to develop as
antitumor agents. [15]. To the best of our knowledge, no
drugs that target histone methylation or epigenetic readers
are FDA approved or under clinical trials. To date, of
the epigenetic agents, only HDAC inhibitors have been
investigated in clinical trials as antitumor agents against
GBM. Thus, this review focuses on recent studies that

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive,
highly invasive, vascularized brain tumor [1]. Despite
multimodal treatment, prognosis is unfortunately
very poor; less than 5% of patients surviving at 5
years following initial diagnosis. Standard regimen
includes maximum safe surgical resection followed
by chemoradiation therapy [2]. Genetics, epigenetics,
bacterial infection, and many other factors influence GBM
oncogenesis, but the molecular mechanism underlying
gliomagenesis is poorly understood [3, 4]. Conventional
chemotherapy has limited efficacy in GBM due to poor
blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, intratumor
heterogeneity, intrinsic GBM resistance, and nonspecific
toxicity [1, 5]. Based on successful preclinical studies,
many clinical trials have tested the efficacy of novel
therapies, but improved survival for patients with GBM
has been limitedly achieved over the past few decades [6].
Therefore, further work is urgently required to discover
novel therapeutic targets and develop more effective
combination strategies for GBM treatment.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have evoked
great interest for the treatment of numerous malignancies
because they are able to change transcriptomic profiles
to promote tumor cell death. Hallmark features of GBM,

(TCGA) created a gene expression-based molecular
classification system in which GBM is categorized
into mesenchymal, classical, neural, and proneural
subtypes [22]. These subtypes were compared with the
corresponding normal neural cell types to determine
the possible cellular origin for each of these tumors;
correlations between subtype and clinical response were
determined. TCGA research network reported that three
signaling pathways are frequently modified in GBM:
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), p53, and retinoblastoma (Rb) signaling.
In adults, components of the RTK/Ras/PI3K pathway are
mutated in 88% of GBMs, those of the p53 pathway in
87%, and those of the Rb pathway in 78%. Mutations
such as amplification of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) can be found in 45% of GBMs, gain of
PI3K function in 15%, and loss of phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) in 36% [23, 24]. These discoveries have
led to a better understanding of the molecular signature of
GBM and have revealed numerous consistent changes in
genes and pathways [4, 16, 22, 25, 26]. However, there is
still an unmet need to translate these findings into clinical
practice, identify predictive biomarkers, and improve
outcomes for patients with GBM.

GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME
Glioblastoma is the most common malignant
primary tumor of the central nervous system in adults.
GBM represents approximately half of all gliomas and
15% of primary brain tumors [1]. WHO grade IV GBM,
which is the highest grade glioma, is divided into two
major classes: “primary” and “secondary.” A vast majority
of GBMs arise de novo as primary GBMs in elderly
patients. Secondary GBMs, those that arise from a preexisting glioma of WHO grade II or III, are less frequent
[16, 17]. Most secondary GBMs develop in younger
patients ( < 45 years). The disease incidence continues to
increase with age and the median age at diagnosis is 64
years. Survival rates are poor; only approximately 34%
of patients survived for 1 year, 12% for 2 years, and less
than 5% for 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Older age
and incomplete surgical resection are associated with poor
survival [18, 19]. GBM remains one of the deadliest of
malignancies, with limited treatment options and a high
rate of recurrence [2, 20, 21].
While histologically identified ischemic necrosis
and elevated microvascular proliferation, GBM is more
accurately characterized and distinguished by its genomic
and epigenomic profiles [19]. The Cancer Genome Atlas

safe surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy with
concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy
[2, 16]. Surgical resection is often compromised by the
diffusely infiltrative nature of gliomas, which recur even
after gross total resection. In addition, these tumors
often invade critical neurological structures, precluding
complete surgical resection [19, 27]. Radiation therapy
following surgery increases the median survival times
ranged from 14 to 36 weeks [28]. The benefits of treatment
with radiation were initially established using whole
brain radiotherapy, but improved technology (e.g., field
radiation therapy) has markedly reduced the associated
side effects [19]. A total radiation dose of 60 Gy delivered
to the tumor provides the maximum survival benefit [29].
The addition of the alkylating agent temozolomide
to postoperative radiation or concurrent temozolomide
and radiotherapy is the only chemotherapeutic regimen
that significantly improves the overall survival (OS) of
patients with GBM. The methylation status of MGMT (O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase), a DNA-repair
gene, is used as a GBM predictor because it is the major
relevant biomarker for the response to temozolomide
treatment [24]. Silencing of MGMT expression by
promoter methylation impairs the ability of tumor cells
to repair the DNA damage induced by temozolomide,
further decreasing tumor cell survival [30]. Patients whose
tumors have the unmethylated MGMT gene promoter also
experience a modest but less significant benefit from the
addition of temozolomide. Thus, combined treatment
with temozolomide and radiation remains the standard
regimen for all patients with GBM [19, 31]. However, the
improved 2-year survival with temozolomide treatment is
only in 27% [24], which is still unsatisfactory.
Currently, bevacizumab (Avastin) is the only
approved therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients
with recurrent GBM. Bevacizumab is a humanized
therapeutic antibody that specifically binds to vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, disrupting VEGFVEGF receptor interaction and preventing angiogenesis
[32, 33]. Because GBM tumors are particularly
vascular and overexpress numerous angiogenic factors,
antiangiogenic therapy is efficient. A phase II trial of
combined treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan
(a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor) in recurrent GBM showed
increased OS from 4.1 to 9.2 months [11]. The 6-month
and 12-month survival rates were 77% and 31%,
respectively [33-35]. However, patients who had received
previous bevacizumab therapy had shorted PFS and OS.
Bevacizumab was subsequently investigated in phase
III trials for newly diagnosed GBM, but there was no
effect on overall patient survival. In addition, phase III
trials are currently being tested to evaluate the efficacy
of bevacizumab with temozolomide and radiotherapy
for newly diagnosed GBM (NCT00884741 and
NCT00943826) [19, 36].

The human genome contains 18 known HDACs,
which are grouped into four classes on basis of
phylogenetic analysis [37, 38]: class I (HDAC1, 2, 3 and
8), IIa (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9) and IIb (HDAC6, 10), III (SIRT17) and VI (HDAC11). The HDAC family is separated into
Zn2+-dependent (classes I, II and IV) and Zn2+-independent
(class III), nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-dependent
enzymes. Class I, II and IV HDACs are also referred to
as classical HDACs. Most HDAC inhibitors available
as anticancer agents target class I and II HDACs. Class
I HDACs are primarily nuclear proteins and have
histones as principle target substrates. Class I HDACs
are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues whereas class II
HDACs are tissue-specifically expressed [39]. Class II
HDACs shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and
have histone and non-histone proteins as primary targets.
HDAC11 (class IV) is phylogenetically most closely
related to HDAC3 and 8 but also has some features of
class II HDACs [40]. Class III HDAC is also called
sirtuins (SIRT) and comprises seven SIRT isoforms
(SIRT1-7), which differ in their substrate specificities,
functions and subcellular localization [41].
HDACs are overexpressed and mutated in various
solid and hematologic malignancies and play key roles
in tumorigenesis [38, 39]. The expression of individual
HDACs is largely inversely correlated with disease-free
and overall survival rates. The aberrant expression of
HDACs correlates with a poor prognosis [42]. However,
the expression and functions of HDACs in GBM are not
well characterized. Recent studies have begun to focus on
the expression patterns of HDACs in GBM. GBM cells
and primary GBM tissues exhibit slightly and variably
increased HDAC1, 3 and 6 expression levels compared to
non-neoplastic brain tissues at both the mRNA and protein
levels [43]. This result was further confirmed in silico
using the REMBRANDT glioma dataset available through
a GlioVis online application. In particular, HDAC1 and 3
expression levels correlate with WHO tumor grades, with
the highest expression levels occurring in GBM samples.
Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses show
that HDAC3 expression is associated with a poor survival
of in GBM patients. Another study demonstrates that
HDAC9 is overexpressed in prognostically poor GBM
patients using TCGA and French’s datasets [44]. This
result was further confirmed in primary GBM tissues and
cell lines. Class III HDAC SIRT2 positively correlates with
GBM malignant progression and inversely correlated with
the survival time of patients with GBM [45]. In contrast,
SIRT1 and 6 are downregulated in GBM tissues and cell
lines [46-48]. The role of SIRT in GBM is currently under
debate due to conflicting findings suggesting that SIRT
acts as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene [49, 50].
SIRT inhibitors have not been clinically tested to evaluate

PRECLINICAL STUDIES OF HDACS AND
HDAC INHIBITORS IN GBM

HDAC inhibitors are classified as epigenetic
agents that target the aberrant epigenetic characteristics
of tumor cells. Epigenetic alterations modulate cellular
phenotype through changes in gene expression without
modifying the DNA sequence [19]. HDAC inhibitors
are known as effective therapeutic anticancer agents via
multiple mechanisms, including the induction of cellcycle arrest, differentiation, senescence, intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptosis, mitotic cell death, autophagic cell
death, generation of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of
angiogenesis and metastasis, and improvement in tumor
immunity [8, 51] (Table 1 and Figure 1). Because these
diverse effects on cancer cells overlap, HDAC inhibitors
are very attractive as single agents and in combination
with other therapies (Table 2). HDAC inhibitors are

Several preclinical studies have revealed that HDAC

including GBM [52-55], breast cancer [56], colorectal
cancer [57], head and neck cancer [58], non-small-cell lung
cancer [59], melanoma [60], and prostate cancer [53]. The
exact molecular mechanism underlying HDAC inhibitorinduced radiosensitization remains elusive. However,
evidence suggests that it partially involves the inhibition of
the DNA damage repair response [19]. HDAC inhibitors

block DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair following
radiation, as evidenced by the continuous expression of
phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) Several HDAC inhibitors
delay the dispersal of γH2AX foci in irradiated cells [52,
53, 55, 57, 59, 60]. Despite the undefined mechanism for
this defective DNA DSB repair process, HDAC inhibitors
may affect at least two components of this repair process.
They induce the downregulation of DNA repair proteins,
including Ku70, Ku80, Ku86, Rad50, and Rad51 [59, 62].
Also, the binding of HDACs to DNA damage response
proteins may play a key role in HDAC inhibitor-induced
radiosensitization [19, 63].
Furthermore, HDAC inhibitors may influence
the response of tumor cells to radiation by changing
the chromatin structure. Pan-HDAC inhibitor LBH589
(panobinostat) treatment induced chromatin relaxation and
this chromatin decondensation correlated with increased
levels of DNA DSBs and radiosensitivity [19, 64]. Thus,
HDAC inhibitor-induced chromatin decompaction may
increase DNA DSBs induced by radiation, ultimately
increasing tumor cell death. Another pan-HDAC inhibitor,
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat),
has shown a similar effect in GBM [65]. DNA damage
response markers and antiapoptotic proteins predict the
radiosensitization efficacy of vorinostat and panobinostat
in patient-derived GBM cells [66]. Responses to SAHA

and LBH589 correlate with pChk2 and Bcl-xL levels.
In patient-derived GBM stem-like cells, the Bcl-2
inhibitor obatoclax is reported to abrogate resistance to
SAHA and LBH589 as radiosensitizers [66]. Other class
I HDAC inhibitors (MS-275 and VPA) were also tested
for administration after irradiation, with differing results.
MS-275 displayed only minimal radiosensitization
after irradiation [19, 53]. In contrast, VPA effectively
radiosensitized cells when administered up to 24 h after
radiation treatment, although the augmented degree was
not strong compared with that of cells treated both before
and after irradiation [19, 67]. Therefore, these data indicate
that sufficiently high HDAC inhibitor levels should be
maintained in tumor cells both before and after irradiation
because the cells seek to repair the DNA damage induced
by radiation [19, 29]. Overall, HDAC inhibitors seem to
prevent DNA DSB repair, resulting in increased tumor cell
death.
Pan-HDAC inhibitors as combination drugs
In addition to radiosensitizers, HDAC inhibitors
have been used as chemosensitizers in GBM [68, 69].
SAHA affects gene expression patterns and proliferation of
glioma cells. After SAHA treatment in GBM cell lines, the
expression level of many proapoptotic, antiproliferative
genes (DR5, TNFα, p21, and p27) increased and that of

reduced GBM cell survival, induced apoptosis, and
inhibited cell-cycle progression [6]. These data also
provide a preclinical rationale for combined treatment with
SAHA and olaparib, which are already under investigation
individually in clinical trials.

many antiapoptotic, progrowth genes (CDK2, CDK4,
and the genes encoding cyclins D1 and D2) decreased
[70]. HDAC1/2 and histone H3K4 demethylase (LSD1/
KDM1) are components of common nuclear corepressor
complexes and the acetylation status of adjacent histone
residues affects the activity of LSD1 [71]. These results
provide the rationale for using dual inhibitors of LSD1
and HDAC for cancer treatment. The inhibition of LSD1
renders GBM cells sensitive to SAHA [68]. Combined
treatment with tranylcypromine and SAHA synergistically
induces apoptotic cell death in GBM cells. These data
suggest that LSD1 and HDACs cooperatively modulate
the key pathways of GBM cell death and verify the
combined administration of LSD1 and HDAC inhibitors
as a therapeutic strategy for GBM.
Several studies report constitutively active DNA
damage response in malignant gliomas caused by
continuous oxidative and replicative stress [6, 72-74].
In addition to constitutive activation of DNA damage
response, genomic instability causes therapeutic resistance
and high recurrence rates. Inhibition of poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) efficiently eradicates GBM
cells, either alone or in combination with chemoradiation
[74, 75]. PARP inhibition increases the radiosensitivity
of radioresistant GBM cells. Currently, a phase I trial
of olaparib (AZD2281; a potent inhibitor of PARP1/2)
in conjunction with temozolomide is being investigated
in patients with relapsed GBM (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:
NCT01390571) [6]. The expression of all DNA damage
response markers (BRCA1, Rad51, and PARP1) was
observed to further decrease when combined with SAHA
and olaparib. This combination treatment synergistically

Isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors
Most of the GBM studies to date have focused on
testing the antitumor effects of pan-HDAC inhibitors
such as vorinostat and VPA rather than evaluating the
role of HDAC in GBM. Despite some encouraging results
from preclinical studies, early clinical trials showed only
modest therapeutic benefits. Therefore, the value of panHDAC inhibitors in clinical practice is needed for further
verification in larger prospective trials to address the
function of each HDAC isoform in GBM. Few recent
studies investigated the role of HDAC isoforms in GBM.
New molecules that target individual HDACs are under
preclinical development (such as PCI-34051, which
targets HDAC8) or clinical trials (such as ACY-1215,
which targets HDAC6).
HDAC6
HDAC6 belongs to class IIb HDAC family. This
enzyme deacetylates various substrates, including
cortactin, Hsp90, and α-tubulin in the cytoplasm and
nucleus [37]. HDAC6 controls both epigenetic and
non-epigenetic mechanisms by shuttling between these
two cellular compartments. An increasing number of
18582

Oncotarget

studies suggest that HDAC6 is also a pivotal regulator of
cancer-related signaling pathways, including the EGFR,
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase
B, and p53 signaling pathways. These findings indicate
HDAC6 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer
therapy [76]. Aberrant expression patterns of HDAC6 are
found in various cancers, including breast cancer [77],
oral squamous cell carcinoma [78], ovarian cancer [79],
GBM [80], and mouse tumor models. Recently, Wang
et al. reported that HDAC6 increases proliferation and
imparts temozolomide resistance in GBM [80]. HDAC6
is overexpressed in GBM tissues and cell lines. HDAC6
overexpression facilitates the proliferation and spheroid
formation of GBM cells and renders GBM cells resistant
to temozolomide. Conversely, knockdown or inactivation
of HDAC6 prevents cell proliferation, induces apoptosis,
hinders spheroid formation, and renders GBM cells more
sensitive to temozolomide. Moreover, temozolomide
resistance is associated with activation of EGFR and
increased expression of HDAC6. The HDAC6 inhibitors
(ACY-1215, tubastatin A, and CAY10603) abrogate
temozolomide resistance by decreasing and inactivating
EGFR protein. These data imply that the inhibition
of HDAC6 is a novel approach for treating GBM and
overcoming resistance to temozolomide. ACY-1215
(ricolinostat), a leading HDAC6-selecitve inhibitor,
is currently being tested in advanced clinical trials for
hematological malignancies (myeloma and lymphoid
malignancies) [81, 82]. Thus, these studies and the fact
that ACY-1215 is already under clinical trials imply that
HDAC6 inhibitors are worthy of consideration for further
clinical tiral in GBM patients.

proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells and
renders the cells sensitive to temozolomide. HDAC2
depletion significantly downregulates the mRNA and
protein expression of MRP1 with no effect on ABCB1
and ABCG2. Schisandrin B, a specific inhibitor of MRP1,
further enhances the temozolomide sensitivity in HDAC2
knockdown GBM cells. This finding suggests that HDAC2
is a viable target for GBM therapy and improves the
efficiency of temozolomide therapy. However, to date, no
HDAC2-specific inhibitors are available.

CLINICAL
TRIALS
INHIBITORS IN GBM

HDAC

Vorinostat, depsipeptide, panobinostat, and
belinostat are the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitors for
cancer therapy; these drugs are used specifically for
the treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
(CTCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and multiple
myeloma [8]. Numerous clinical trials are evaluating
the safety and efficacy of other HDAC inhibitors, used
singly or in combination, for the treatment of various
malignancies [19] (https://clinicaltrials.gov). In general,
the side effects of HDAC inhibitors include dehydration,
diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia,
neutropenia, and prolonged QT [19, 90]. Despite favorable
toxicity profiles and reversible adverse effects, HDAC
inhibitors seem to be not sufficient as monotherapies
in solid tumors compared with current standard cancer
therapies, partly because of their poor pharmacokinetic
properties [11, 91]. However, the potential of HDAC
inhibitors as cancer therapeutic agents is apparent
from clinical trials combining HDAC inhibitors with
chemotherapies or targeted therapies. Table 3 summarizes
the ongoing clinical trials of HDAC inhibitors in GBM.

HDAC9
HDAC9 is a member of the class IIa HDAC family
and controls regulatory T cell function, cardiac growth,
and muscle differentiation [83-85]. It has been reported
that HDAC9 expression is significantly upregulated
in cervical cancer [86], medulloblastoma [87], acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [88], and GBM [44]. HDAC9
is overexpressed in GBM patients who have a poor
prognosis. HDAC9 promotes GBM proliferation and
tumor formation via activation of the transcription
coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)-mediated
EGFR pathway [44]. HDAC9 directly interacts with
TAZ, an oncogene and an essential downstream effector
of the Hippo pathway. Depletion of HDAC9 reduces the
expression of TAZ. A significant effort is underway to
find new molecules targeting class IIa HDACs, including
HDAC9. However, to date, no HDAC9-specific inhibitors
are available. Nevertheless, these results provide new
evidence of a promising target for GBM treatment.

Vorinostat
Vorinostat is a small-molecule inhibitor of human
class I and II HDACs that was the first FDA-approved
HDAC inhibitor for the treatment of refractory CTCL.
It has been reported that vorinostat can penetrate BBB
and possesses antitumor effects in glioma models [70,
92]. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor
to enter clinical trials in GBM and is well tolerated as a
monotherapy as well as combination therapy in recurrent
GBM. A phase II trial tested the efficacy of vorinostat in
patients with recurrent GBM [11, 33]. A total complete
response (CR) or partial response (PR) occurred in
only 3% of patients. Median progression-free survival
(PFS) was 1.9 months and 6-month PFS was 17%. This
trial showed modest monotherapy activity of vorinostat
with a median OS of 5.7 months in recurrent GBM.
There are multiple ongoing phase II trials of vorinostat
in conjunction with targeted agents, temozolomide, and

radiotherapy. A phase I trial of vorinostat in conjunction
with temozolomide was well tolerated in patients with
high-grade glioma, although thrombocytopenia and a
related grade V hemorrhage were dose-limiting toxicities
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00268385). A phase I/II
trial of vorinostat with radiotherapy and concomitant
temozolomide demonstrated reasonable tolerability in
newly diagnosed GBM, although the phase II efficacy
information is not yet published (NCT00731731). A phase
I/II trial of vorinostat, temozolomide, and isotretinoin in
recurrent GBM is underway (NCT00555399). Another
phase II trial investigated the effects of combination
treatment of vorinostat with bortezomib (a proteasome
inhibitor) in recurrent GBM [10, 33]. However, the trial
was stopped because patients did not obtain 6-month PFS
on interim analysis. The reduction of antitumor activity of
bortezomib in GBM is likely due to lack of penetration of
the BBB [93]. A phase I trial of vorinostat in combination
with bevacizumab and irinotecan (a topoisomerase I
inhibitor) in recurrent GBM found the same maximum
tolerated dose for vorinostat with less thrombocytopenia.
In addition, this study showed improved PFS and OS
compared to that of vorinostat alone (NCT00762255)
[9]. A phase II trial of vorinostat and bevacizumab for
recurrent GBM is ongoing (NCT01738646).

[13]. The median OS is reported to be 29.6 months in
patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The most common
grade III/IV toxicities of the combination regimen are
metabolic and laboratory toxicities (8%), neurological
toxicity (11%), and blood and bone marrow toxicity (32%)
(NCT00302159) [107], which seem to be well tolerated.
Based on the considerable preclinical and retrospective
data, VPA is considered to be one of the most promising
agents for GBM treatment, but prospective data are still
limited [107]. Further investigations are needed to assess
its efficacy and clarify the optimal treatment.

Panobinostat

Despite advances in therapeutics and diagnostics,
the prognosis of GBM is still poor, and clinically relevant
biomarkers have not been established. Due to the
heterogeneity of GBM tumors, new strategies have shown
clinical limits in terms of efficacy and side effects. We need
to understand the complexity of GBM to offer insight into
the prognosis and management of this incurable disease.
GBM tumorigenesis and chemoresistance are mediated by
multiple factors, suggesting that multitargeted strategies
are more efficient. Therefore, classification of GMB
patients based on genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional
profiling data might be beneficial for selecting drugs
for their treatment and predicting patient outcomes.
Indeed, progress in the molecular classification of GBM
contributes to develop more effective targeted therapeutic
agents and combination strategies and to predict patient
outcome. However, this progress is still unsatisfactory.
We should pursue new discoveries that come from basic
science and translate these scientific findings into effective
clinical practice.

Romidepsin
Romidepsin (FK228) is a class I HDAC inhibitor
[108] and was the second FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor
for the treatment of refractory CTCL and PTCL [109]. It
induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation and metastasis
of GBM cells [110]. Romidepsin was studied in a phase I/
II trial on patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, but
at the standard dose and schedule, it was ineffective for
patients with recurrent GBM (NCT00085540) [111].

CONCLUSIONS

Panobinostat (LBH589) is a potent, small-molecule
inhibitor of class I, II, and IV HDACs that was FDAapproved for the treatment of multiple myeloma [94].
Panobinostat shows antitumor and antiangiogenic
effects in glioma. A phase II trial of panobinostat in
combination with bevacizumab in recurrent GBM was
well tolerated. However, the trial was terminated because
combination regimen did not significantly improve PFS at
6 month compared to historical controls of bevacizumab
monotherapy (NCT00859222) [95].

Valproic acid
VPA is a class I HDAC inhibitor as well as an
antiepileptic drug [19], has a low toxicity profile [96] and
effectively crosses BBB [97]. VPA showed impressive
preclinical efficacy as a radiosensitizer in glioma cells
at a dose comparable to that achievable clinically [98101]. In contrast, it had a radioprotective effect on normal
brain tissue and hippocampal neurons [102, 103]. Several
retrospective studies analyzed the effects of VPA on the
survival of GBM patients [104-106]. Although these
results have suggested favorable effects of VPA, whether
VPA improves the OS of GBM patients is debatable
[107]. However, a phase II trial of VPA, temozolomide,
and concurrent radiotherapy for GBM patients was
investigated and promising results were recently reported
