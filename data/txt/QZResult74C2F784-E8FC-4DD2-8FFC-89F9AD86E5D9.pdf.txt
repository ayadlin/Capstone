Abstract
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), one of the downstream products of cyclooxygenase-2 enzymatic activity, promotes colorectal carcinogenesis in part by stimulating cell division. In this study, we define a critical
mechanism in this process by showing that the prometastatic adapter protein human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1; NEDD9) links PGE2 to the cell cycle machinery in colorectal cancer cells. PGE2 rapidly
induced expression of HEF1 mRNA and protein in colorectal cancer cells. HEF1 overexpression elicited the
same effects as PGE2 treatment on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and tumor growth. Conversely,
HEF1 knockdown suppressed PGE2-driven cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Cell cycle alterations involved HEF1 fragmentation as well as co-distribution of HEF1 and cell cycle kinase Aurora A along
spindle asters during cell division. Moreover, Aurora A co-immunoprecipitated with HEF1 and was activated by HEF1. Consistent with a role for HEF1 in colorectal carcinogenesis, we found elevated expression
of HEF1 expression in 50% of human colorectal cancers examined, relative to paired normal tissues. These
findings establish that PGE2 induces HEF1 expression, which in turn promotes cell cycle progression
through its interaction with and activation of Aurora A. Further, they establish that HEF1 is a crucial
downstream mediator of PGE2 action during colorectal carcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 70(2); 824–31. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most abundant prostaglandin found in colorectal cancer tissue and is a downstream
product of the inducible enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
A significant increase in COX-2 gene expression has been
linked to colorectal carcinogenesis (1). Inhibition of COX-2 activity by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly selective COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib, can suppress
colorectal adenoma recurrence (2). PGE2 is the primary mediator of COX-2 in promoting cancer progression. Many studies
have shown that PGE2 promotes cell proliferation and tumor
growth in colorectal cancer (3–6). Several pathways or molecules have been implicated as downstream mediators of PGE2
in promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth, which include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, the
Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, βcatenin/T-cell factor 4, and peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor δ (3–6). Obviously, more work is needed to reveal
the details by which PGE2 signaling affects cell proliferation.

Human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1) is a scaffold
protein that encodes multiple protein interaction domains.
It has been implicated in numerous biological activities including mediating integrin-dependent signals at focal adhesions. HEF1 is preferentially expressed in epithelial cells and
lymphocytes and undergoes substantial regulation during
progression through the cell cycle (7). The regulation of
HEF1 expression is not fully understood. Transforming
growth factor-β and all-trans retinoic acid have been shown
to upregulate HEF1 expression at the transcriptional level
(8–10). Serum can also increase HEF1 expression (11).
HEF1 localizes not only at focal adhesions but also at the
centrosomes and mitotic spindles following stimulation by
intrinsic and extrinsic cues (7). Studies have shown that
HEF1 becomes fragmented and moves from the cytoplasm
and focal adhesions to centrosomes and mitotic spindles
during mitosis, where it interacts with and activates Aurora
A to promote cell cycle progression (12–14).
Because both PGE2 and HEF1 have been implicated in promoting cell proliferation or cell cycle progression in certain
contexts, we hypothesized that PGE2 induces HEF1 expression to promote cell cycle progression and growth of colorectal cancers. In the present study, we show that HEF1
functions as an important downstream target of PGE2, which
promotes the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells.

PGE2 Induces HEF1 to Promote Tumor Growth

Figure 1. PGE2-induced HEF1 expression in colorectal cancer cells.
A, HEF1 was induced by PGE2 in LS-174T cells. LS-174T cells were
treated with different doses of PGE2 for 24 h or examined using a single
1 μmol/L dose at different time points. After total RNA was collected,
HEF1 expression was examined using quantitative PCR. B, LS-174T and
HCA-7 cells were treated with PGE2 as in A. HEF1 expression was
examined by Western blotting. C, other colorectal cancer cell lines also
upregulated HEF1 in response to PGE2. A panel of colorectal cancer
cell lines were treated with 1 μmol/L PGE2 for 24 h, and protein lysates
were analyzed for HEF1 expression (top). LoVo cells were treated as
described in B, and Western blotting was done for HEF1 (bottom).

phospho-Aurora A antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Ki-67 antibody was purchased from
DAKO. β-Actin antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Retroviral HEF1 expression vector (LZRS-Ires-HEF1) and
control vector (LZRS-Ires-GFP) were kind gifts from Dr. Lynda

lencing vector (pGIPZ-shCon) were purchased from Open
Biosystems. Lentivirus packaging vectors pMD2.G and
psPAX2 (Addgene plasmids 12259 and 12260) were purchased from Addgene. Human colorectal tumor specimens
were obtained as described previously (15).
Cell culture. LS-174T, LoVo, Caco-2, and DLD-1 cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. HCA7 cells were a generous gift from Susan Kirkland (Department of Histopathology, Imperial College London, London,
United Kingdom). These cells were maintained in McCoy's
5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2
atmosphere.
Microarray analysis. LS-174T cells were cultured in
serum-free medium for 48 h and treated without or with
1 μmol/L PGE2 for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h with three replicates
per group. Total RNAs were extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) and subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Resulting data were
analyzed by GeneSpring GX and GeneTraffic softwares.
Those genes with significant change in expression (at least
2-fold change) as compared with control (0 h) were selected
for further study.
Quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCR was done as described previously (15). Primers used were human Hef1 forward,
5′-GATGGGTGTCTCCAGCCTAA-3′, and reverse, 5′GGATCTGGTGGGAGTCTTCA-3′; human COX-2 forward,
5′-CCCTTGGGTGTCAAAGGTAA-3′, and reverse, 5′GCCCTCGCTTATGATCTGTC-3′; and human β-actin forward, 5′-AGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC-3′, and reverse,
5′-AGAGGCGTACAGGGATAGCA-3′.
Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis was done
as previously described (15). Blot was hybridized in Hybrisol
I (InterGen) with a 32P-labeled human Hef1 cDNA in coding
region. The blot was exposed to film. The dot density on developed film was measured using NIH ImageJ software.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done as
described previously (16). HEF1 can be cleaved into smaller
fragments (1–405 amino acids, 44 kDa; the full length of HEF1
is 835 amino acids, 105 kDa) under certain conditions (12).
The HEF1 antibody [2B11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which
is raised against amino acids 82–398 of human HEF1] can
recognize both the full length and the small fragment of HEF1.
Proliferation assay. Ninety-six-well plates were seeded
with 3,000 cells per well in 0.1 mL of growth medium. After
cells were allowed to attach overnight at 37°C, they were
washed twice with PBS and then incubated in serum-free
medium for 2 d. In dose-response studies, cells were treated
with different concentrations of PGE2 in serum-free medium
for 3 d. Time-point experiments involved a single 1 μmol/L
concentration of PGE2. Cell growth was determined by adding 10 μL of WST-1 proliferation reagent per well in the last
4 h or 20 μL of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) label (Calbiochem) per well in the last 24 h, following the assay protocol.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax M5
microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
Retrovirus and lentivirus production and stable transfection. LZRS-Ires-HEF1 and control LZRS-Ires-GFP retroviral
vectors were transfected into Phoenix cells, or pGIPZ-shHEF1

and pGIPZ-shCon along with package vectors psPAX2 and
pMD2.G were transfected into 293T cells in 60-mm dishes
using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation, the
transfection medium was removed and replaced by 3 mL of
growth medium. Culture medium containing virus particles
was collected 24 h later and passed through a 0.45-μm filter
to remove cell debris. Cells were plated in a 60-mm dish
24 h before they were infected. Medium containing virus
was added to the cells and repeated one more time with freshly collected virus particles 24 h later. During the viral infection
process, the final concentration of polybrene (Sigma) in these
experiments was adjusted to 4 μg/mL for Phoenix cells and
8 μg/mL for 293T cells. Puromycin (2 μg/mL) was added for
5 d, or after 3 d of infection, cells were sorted by green fluorescent protein (GFP) positivity to eliminate uninfected cells.

Cell cycle analysis. Cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 2 d. Fresh serum-free medium containing 1 μmol/L
PGE2 was added for 24 h. Cells were collected by trypsinization and fixed with 100% ethanol on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation (500 × g for 3 min), cells were stained with
propidium iodide (Invitrogen) in 1 mL of staining solution
containing 50 μg/mL propidium iodide, 100 μg/mL RNase
A (DNase-free), and 70% ethanol prepared in PBS. After a
30-min incubation, the stained cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for cell cycle analysis.
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence studies involved plating cells on coverslips in 10% serum medium. After overnight growth, cells were washed twice with PBS, fed
with serum-free medium, and incubated at 37°C for 2 more
days. After treatment with 1 μmol/L PGE2 in fresh serum-free
medium for 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde

Immunohistochemistry. General procedures for immunohistochemical staining were followed. Briefly, after dewaxing
and rehydrating, slides were boiled in citrate buffer using an
EZRetriever microwave (Biogenex; 98°C for 5 min). Blocking
was done with 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat
serum in PBS. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight. Antibodies used were anti-HEF1 (2B11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200) and anti–Ki-67 (DAKO; 1:50). Secondary
antibody was incubated at room temperature for 1 h followed
by diaminobenzedine chromogen (Vector Laboratories) and
hematoxylin counterstaining.
Co-immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was done as described previously (16) using anti-HEF1
(2B11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti–Aurora A antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology).
Xenograft study. All mice were housed and treated in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Texas
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. LS-174T cells (5 × 105) selected for the stable expression of HEF1 (LS-174T/HEF1) or control GFP (LS-174T/GFP) were injected s.c. into the flanks of
nude mice. Three weeks after injection, the mice were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation; necropsies were done to remove tumors; and measurements were taken of tumor
weight and size.
Statistical analysis. Each experiment was done at least
three times, and data are presented as the mean ± SE. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test, onefactor ANOVA, or two-factor ANOVA, where applicable. P <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

PGE2 induces HEF1 expression in colorectal cancer cells.
To identify potential target genes regulated by PGE2 in colorectal cancer, LS-174T cells were treated with or without
PGE2 and subjected to microarray analysis, which showed
a 4-fold increase in HEF1 mRNA expression (17, 18). To confirm the microarray results, quantitative PCR and Western
blot analysis revealed that PGE2 rapidly induced HEF1 expression at both the RNA (Fig. 1A) and protein levels (Fig.
1B, top; Supplementary Fig. S1). The induction of HEF1
mRNA expression was significant and persisted for at least
24 hours. At the protein level, HEF1 expression peaked between 6 and 12 hours. HEF1 expression was also increased
in HCA-7 cells (Fig. 1B, bottom). Other colorectal cancer cell
lines that express low basal levels of HEF1 also responded to
PGE2 treatment by upregulating HEF1 protein expression,
but not to the same degree as that observed in LS-174T
and HCA-7 cells (Fig. 1C). Because HEF1 induction was most
dramatic in LS-174T cells, subsequent experiments were carried out using this cell line.
Alteration of HEF1 expression affects PGE2-induced proliferation in LS-174T cells. PGE2 treatment led to increased
cell proliferation in LS-174T and HCA-7 cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2A). To examine whether HEF1 plays
a role in PGE2-induced cell proliferation, HEF1 expression
was knocked down using shRNA in LS-174T cells. HEF1

protein expression decreased by about 50% with HEF1 shRNA
compared with control shRNA (Fig. 2B, left). Although the
knockdown did not completely eliminate the expression of
HEF1 protein, cell proliferation was significantly reduced
(Fig. 2B, right). These data suggest that suppression of
HEF1 expression limits the ability of parental LS-174T cells
to respond to PGE2-induced cell proliferation.
To further show that HEF1 mediates the effect of PGE2 on
cell proliferation, HEF1 protein was overexpressed in LS174T/HEF1 cells compared with LS-174T/GFP cells (Fig. 2C,
left). In the absence of PGE2, stable HEF1 overexpression in
LS-174T/HEF1 cells led to increased cell proliferation compared with GFP alone in control cells (Fig. 2C, middle;
0 μmol/L). PGE2 treatment increased the proliferation of
both LS-174T/GFP and LS-174T/HEF1 cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, middle and right). Overex-

pression of HEF1 in another colorectal cancer cell line, LoVo,
also resulted to increased cell proliferation as in LS-174T
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). These data suggest that increased HEF1 expression increases cell proliferation similar
to that observed with PGE2 treatment (Fig. 2A).
PGE2 treatment and HEF1 expression influence cell proliferation by modulating cell cycle progression. To study
the mechanism by which PGE2 increases cell proliferation,
we performed FACS analysis with PGE2-treated LS-174T
cells. Treatment with PGE2 shifted the number of parental
LS-174T cells from the G1 phase into the S-G2 phase of the
cell cycle (Fig. 3A). To show the role of HEF1 in PGE2induced cell cycle progression, we first examined whether
HEF1 also promotes cell cycle progression by using the
HEF1-overexpressing LS-174T/HEF1 cells. As expected,
overexpression of HEF1 in LS-174T cells shifted the number

PGE2 Induces HEF1 to Promote Tumor Growth

Figure 5. Increases in HEF1 expression promoted tumor growth in
nude mice. LS-174T/GFP and LS-174T/HEF1 cells (5 × 105) were s.c.
injected into the flanks of nude mice (n = 5). Three weeks later, mice were
euthanized and necropsied, and measurements were taken for tumor
weight (A, left; P = 0.0188; * indicates P < 0.05) and size (A, right;
P = 0.0458; * indicates P < 0.05). B, distribution of HEF1 and Ki-67 in
tumors formed from LS-174T/HEF1 cell. Immunohistochemical staining
for HEF1 and Ki-67 was done with sectioned tissues from the tumors
described in A. C, HEF1 co-immunoprecipitated with Aurora A in tumors
grown in vivo. Cell lysates from the tumors described in A were used
for precipitation with anti–Aurora A and blotted with anti-HEF1 after
separating on SDS-PAGE.

of cells from the G1 phase into the S-G2 phase (Fig. 3B). Next,
we examined whether decrease of HEF1 attenuates the effect
of PGE 2 on cell cycle progression. Indeed, knockdown of
HEF1 minimally effected the cell cycle progression of parental LS-174T cells in serum-free medium but blocked
PGE2-induced cell cycle progression (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that HEF1 mediates the effect of PGE2 on
the progression of cells from the G1 to the S-G2 phase of
the cell cycle.
PGE2 treatment and HEF1 expression influence cell cycle
progression by interacting with Aurora A. HEF1 has been
shown to regulate cell cycle progression by fragmenting
and relocalizing to spindle asters and activating Aurora A
(11, 12, 19). PGE2 treatment led to increased levels of fragmented HEF1 found in LS-174T cells (Fig. 4A). Further examination of these cells by immunofluorescence showed that a

single 1 μmol/L dose of PGE2 increased the number of cells
observed in metaphase (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence analyses also revealed that HEF1 localized in the cytoplasm of
quiescent LS-174T cells (Fig. 4C, top). In contrast, close examination of mitotic cells indicated increased instances of
metaphase or anaphase along with elevated levels of HEF1
(green) that had redistributed to the area surrounding spindle asters (Fig. 4C). Aurora A (red) staining showed a pattern
similar to that of HEF1. When these red and green staining
patterns were combined into merged images, the presence of
yellow areas indicated that these two proteins were colocalized in LS-174T cells (Fig. 4C, bottom). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated a direct interaction between HEF1
and Aurora A and PGE2 induction of Aurora A phosphorylation in LS-174T cells (Fig. 4D, left). These data suggest that
PGE2 stimulates HEF1 fragmentation and relocalization to
spindle asters and the activation of Aurora A to enhance cell
cycle progression.
HEF1 increases tumor growth in vivo. LS-174T/HEF1 or
LS-174T/GFP cells were injected into the flanks of nude mice
to validate whether our in vitro observations would translate
into similar effects in vivo. The mice were euthanized 3 weeks
after injection, and tumor weight and size were measured.
Cells expressing HEF1 resulted in a significant increase in
both tumor weight and size compared with those expressing
the GFP control (Fig. 5A). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that HEF1 and Ki-67 stained the same population of
cells in those tumors (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, HEF1 interacted
with Aurora A in the tumors formed from LS-174T/HEF1
cells (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that HEF1 also interacts
with Aurora A to promote cell proliferation and tumor
growth in vivo.
HEF1 expression is increased in colorectal cancers. Given that COX-2 overexpression is observed in approximately
70% to 80% of colorectal cancers (20), we hypothesized that
HEF1 expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer as well.
Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that HEF1 expression increased in at least 7 of 15 tumor specimens compared with
adjacent normal mucosa (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Meanwhile, higher HEF1 expression (tumor/normal ratio
>1) was found in 15 of 30 tumor tissues using Northern blot
analysis (Fig. 6B). Overall, HEF1 expression increased in
about 50% of colorectal cancers compared with normal tissues and correlated with COX-2 expression (Supplementary
Fig. S3B; r = 0.6235, P = 0.013).

Discussion
Elevated expression of COX-2 and concomitant overproduction of PGE2 have been directly linked to colorectal carcinogenesis. COX-2 inhibitors can suppress colorectal
carcinogenesis, but long-term use can cause adverse effects
in a subset of patients (1). Our research has focused on identifying and characterizing the effector molecules downstream
of PGE2-driven signaling involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, with the ultimate goal of developing approaches that
have the same benefit but with fewer resulting side effects.
Here we report that PGE2 rapidly stimulated the expression

of HEF1 in colorectal cancer cells. Both PGE2 treatment and
HEF1 expression elicited similar effects on cell proliferation
and tumor growth. The alteration of HEF1 levels by PGE2 influenced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, suggesting that HEF1 can act as a downstream effector of PGE2 in
these biological functions.
Reports from our laboratory, as well as those of others,
show that PGE2 affects cell proliferation by activating the
MAPK or PI3K/Akt pathways (3, 6, 21, 22). How these pathways link to cell division to regulate cell proliferation must
be further defined. Here, we present the first data indicating
that HEF1 can also mediate the effects of PGE2. PGE2 treatment induced HEF1 expression and increased the proliferation of serum-starved LS-174T and HCA-7 cells (Figs. 1B and
2A). Increased HEF1 expression had a similar effect on the
proliferation of LS-174T cells not treated with PGE2 (Fig.
2C, middle, 0 μmol/L). Moreover, knockdown of HEF1 attenuated the effect of PGE2-enhanced cell proliferation (Fig. 2B).
This was even more evident after HEF1 knockdown, which
blocked the ability of PGE2 to promote cell cycle progression
(Fig. 3C). Together, these results indicate that HEF1 mediates
the biological effects of PGE2 during cell proliferation and
cell cycle progression. Furthermore, HEF1 mechanistically
fragmented, relocated, and co-distributed with Aurora A

along spindle asters during cell division (Fig. 4A and C).
HEF1 interacted with Aurora A and activated it (Fig. 4D),
which is required for the G2-to-M transition during cell division. Thus, HEF1 mediates the effect of PGE2 on tumor
growth through enhancing the cell cycle progression.
HEF1 protein relocalized from focal adhesions to the mitotic spindle asters in a cell cycle–regulated manner in
MCF-7 cells (14). Increased HEF1 in G2-M phases was accompanied with increased level of fragmentation, and the
resulting fragments moved from the cytoplasm or focal adhesions to the centrosomes, where these fragments interacted with and activated molecules required for mitotic
progression, such as Aurora A (12, 13). These studies have
clearly shown the involvement of HEF1 in the regulation of
cell cycle progression by using chemically synchronized
MCF-7 cells and serum stimulation. In the present study,
we tried to synchronize LS-174T cells with serum starvation. However, LS-174T cells were able to grow and divide
in the absence of serum (data not shown). Therefore, the
cell population we used was a mixed group of cells in different stages of the cell cycle. This could be one of the
reasons why only a small group of cells in cell cycle progression responded to PGE2 treatment or HEF1 alteration
(Fig. 3). Here we showed that a single bioactive lipid, PGE2,

PGE2 Induces HEF1 to Promote Tumor Growth

has the same effect as serum on HEF1 induction, fragmentation, and relocalization and Aurora A activation.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that HEF1 is induced by PGE2 and mediates its effects in promoting cell
proliferation by enhancing cell cycle progression. Given
that HEF1 can redistribute between the focal adhesions
of migrating cells and the mitotic machinery as cells divide, it may act as a “molecular switch” that causes cells
to either migrate or enter cell division. We are currently
studying the possible involvement of HEF1 in PGE2-stimulated migration, invasion, and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells. Together, these studies will add to our
understanding of how PGE2 regulates cell proliferation, cell
cycle progression, cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.
The eventual goal is to help identify the possible targets
downstream of COX-2 for the prevention and treatment of
colorectal cancer.
