Abstract
Treatment with RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib causes the development of cutaneous squamous cell
carcinomas (cSCC) or keratoacanthomas as a side effect in 18% to 30% of patients. It is known that RAF inhibitors
activate the mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and stimulate growth of RAS-mutated cells,
possibly accounting for up to 60% of cSCC or keratoacanthoma lesions with RAS mutations, but other
contributing events are obscure. To identify such events, we evaluated tumors from patients treated with
vemurafenib for the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA and identiﬁed 13% to be positive. Using a
transgenic murine model of HPV-driven cSCC (K14-HPV16 mice), we conducted a functional test to determine
whether administration of RAF inhibitors could promote cSCC in HPV-infected tissues. Vemurafenib treatment
elevated MAPK markers and increased cSCC incidence from 22% to 70% in this model. Furthermore, 55% of the
cSCCs arising in vemurafenib-treated mice exhibited a wild-type Ras genotype, consistent with the frequency
observed in human patients. Our results argue that HPV cooperates with vemurafenib to promote tumorigenesis,
in either the presence or absence of RAS mutations. Cancer Res; 74(8); 2238–45. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Nearly 50% of melanomas harbor a single activating Valine
to Glutamic acid point mutation of the BRAF kinase (1).
Constitutive BRAF activation leads to phosphorylation of the
downstream effectors MAP–ERK kinase (MEK), then extracellular signal—regulated kinase (ERK), which in turn activates
transcription factors that promote proliferation of cancer cells.
Phase II and phase III clinical trial results in BRAFV600Emutated melanoma patients treated with the RAF inhibitor,
vemurafenib, demonstrated improved survival and dramatic
reduction in tumor burden (2, 3). Among the most common
side effects is the emergence of nonmelanocytic cutaneous
tumors, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas
(cSCC), keratoacanthomas, and verrucous papillomas (2–5).
Preclinical data demonstrate that RAF inhibitors paradoxically
stimulate ERK phosphorylation in RAS-mutated cancer cells
(6–9) through allosteric and catalytic mechanisms that relieve
the auto-inhibition of wild-type RAF kinase (10). It is therefore

hypothesized that paradoxical activation of the mitogen—
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway induces cSCC and
keratoacanthomas tumorigenesis in patients treated with RAF
inhibitors.
Several groups have described the genetics of keratoacanthomas and cSCC induced by RAF inhibitors. Most notably
18% to 60% of the clinical biopsies harbor a RAS mutation (11–
13), and treatment with a vemurafenib analogue (PLX-4720)
also decreased tumor latency in a mouse model for Hras-driven
cSCC (13). However, 40% to 82% of keratoacanthomas and
cSCCs from RAF inhibitor-treated patients are RAS wild-type,
suggesting that accelerated oncogenesis of RAS-mutated cells
is not the only mechanism involved. Among the other mutated
genes identiﬁed in cutaneous lesions from RAF inhibitortreated patients are FGFR3, TGFBR1, MYC, PIK3CA, and tumor
suppressors TP53, CDKN2A, and VHL (4, 11). Although FGFR3
and TGFBR1 mutations may lead to RAS activation and therefore hyperactivate the MAPK pathway in response to RAF
inhibitors, it is unclear how critical RAS-activating oncogenes
are to vemurafenib-induced cSCC. Furthermore, the role of
other drivers, such as infectious agents like human papilloma
virus (HPV), has not been carefully examined. Therefore, we
used a transgenic mouse model that expresses the HPV16 early
genes from the keratin 14 promoter (K14-HPV16) to evaluate
the relationship between vemurafenib treatment and HPV in
driving cSCC (14).

consensus FAP59/64 primers as described (15). Samples were
also analyzed by a nested PCR method with two sets of
degenerate primers (CP65/CP70 and CP66/CP69) located in
the L1 open reading frame as described (16). Amplimers were
sequenced and the HPV genotype was identiﬁed by comparison of sample sequence with Genebank database.
RAS genotyping of clinical biopsies
Genomic DNA was extracted from 10 to 20-mm thick parafﬁn-embedded unstained slides of each skin lesion and full
coding sequences of HRAS (NM_005343.2) exons 2 and 3, KRAS
(NM_033360.2) and exons 2 and 3, NRAS (NM_002524.3).
Sequences were analyzed by Sanger direct sequencing performed after PCR ampliﬁcation of target exons. Sequencing
reactions were carried out using the BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit software according to the manufacturer's
recommendations (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions
were analyzed on a 48-capillary 3730 DNA Analyzer. Sequence
reading and alignment were performed with SeqScape software (Applied Biosystems).
Tissue culture
Proliferation of A375, SW620 (from ATCC), and GTL-16 cells
(from S. Giordano, Cancer Research and Treatment, Turin,
Italy) was measured by Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) and Rat-1 cells
(from J. Gorski, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) were
grown in soft agar suspension. pERK quantiﬁcation by sandwich immunoassay (MSD). All cell lines were routinely
inspected for morphologic changes and tested mycoplasma

DNA copy number and gene expression changes as previously
described (17). Primary antibodies used for immunoblot analyses: MEK, ERK, pMEK, pERK (Cell Signaling Technology, 9122,
9102, 9121, and 9101, respectively).

domized and blinded before histology scores determined by a
pathologist. Skin and tumor samples were ranked as normal,
premalignant, or malignant cSCC (Fig. 3B). Premalignant
histology included moderate to severe hyperplasia, dysplasia,
and hyperkeratosis. K14-HPV16 cSCCs are marked by keratin
"pearls" of invasive well-differentiated squamous carcinoma
(WDSC) occurring primarily on the ventral surface of the
ear, or by a keratin cap containing heterogeneous regions
of moderate to poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma
(M/PDSC) occurring primarily on the chest and trunk. Malignant phenotypes included any M/PDSC, WDSC, and keratoacanthoma-like lesions.
Ras genotyping of mouse K14-HPV16 cSCC
Genomic DNA was collected from nine cSCCs and one
nontumor skin sample from untreated K14-HPV16 mice, and
nine cSCCs and one nontumor skin sample from K14-HPV16
mice treated with 60 mg/kg vemurafenib. A total of 100 bp  2
paired end sequencing (Illumina) was performed after mouse
exome capture (Agilent). Sequences were aligned to the MM9
genome using bwa v0.6.1 (18) and processed according to
GATK v2 (19) best practices by running the IndelRealigner,
MarkDuplicates, and TableRecalibration tools per sample, and
using dbSNP (20) for known variants. The GATK UniﬁedGenotyper (18) was then used to call variants on all 20 samples
together with nondefault options -dcov 1000 and -rf MappingQualityZero. Called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
and INDELs were hard ﬁltered with the GATK VariantFiltration tool using criteria Fisher Strand (FS) > 80.0, Hypopolymer

Results

Mice
FVB.Cg-Tg (KRT-14-HPV16) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Unless otherwise stated, mice 6 months old
that had not yet developed cSCC received 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg
once daily for 60 days of vemurafenib by oral gavage. For
inhibitor combination studies, mice were given 3 mg/kg
PD0325901 administered twice daily in addition to 60 mg/kg
vemurafenib daily. Because cSCC most frequently occur on
the ears or chest in this model, these tissues were collected
from every mouse (in addition to any tumor present, regardless of location) and frozen in liquid nitrogen for PCR analysis
or formalin ﬁxed and parafﬁn embedded for histology. Nontransgenic littermates were used as negative controls. Dusp6
mRNA expression levels were quantiﬁed by quantitative PCR
(qPCR) from RNA in the collected tissues (Qiagen ﬁbrous
tissue RNA collection kit; Ambion cDNA synthesis kit). Dusp6
mRNA was normalized to 18s rRNA (Applied Biosystems:
Mm00518185_m1 and 4319413E).

Vemurafenib paradoxically activates the MAPK pathway
in RAF wild-type epidermis
To determine whether clinically relevant exposures to
vemurafenib are sufﬁcient to activate the MAPK pathway and
promote cSCC tumorigenesis in vivo, nontransgenic FVB/N
mice were treated with 60 mg/kg vemurafenib (equivalent to
the phase III dose; ref. 2) for 60 days. Although none of the mice
treated developed spontaneous tumors, subtle evidence of
elevated MAPK activity was observed in epithelial tissues. A
modest increase in nuclear phosphorylated ERK staining was
observed in nonglandular gastric epithelium (Supplementary
Fig. S2) and epidermis (Fig. 1A). Because transcriptional targets
of the MAPK pathway are often a more sensitive marker for
ERK activity (21), Dusp6 mRNA levels were measured by
qPCR and were found to be increased 3-fold in skin from
vemurafenib-treated mice (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that
vemurafenib paradoxically activates the MAPK pathway in
genetically wild-type mouse epidermis, but is insufﬁcient for
cSCC tumorigenesis.

Tissues were formalin ﬁxed and parafﬁn embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or anti-pERK

required for vemurafenib to promote tumorigenesis. To test
this in vitro, three cancer cell lines with different RAS/RAF
mutations were treated with vemurafenib. Although vemurafenib effectively inhibited ERK phosphorylation and proliferation of BRAF-mutated cells, ERK phosphorylation was stimulated and proliferation increased in RAS/RAF wild-type cells,
though to markedly higher levels in the KRAS-mutated cell
(Fig. 1C). High doses of vemurafenib similarly increased ERK
phosphorylation and induced anchorage-independent growth
of RAS/RAF wild-type Rat-1 ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that vemurafenib treatment is sufﬁcient to activate the
MAPK pathway and promote a transformation phenotype.
However, the magnitude of activation may be dependent upon
the underlying genetics, and vemurafenib-induced activation
seems to be particularly exaggerated in RAS-mutated cells.
A subset of cutaneous lesions from vemurafenib-treated
patients are HPV-positive and RAS wild-type
Given these observations, we hypothesized that paradoxical
activation of the MAPK pathway by RAF inhibitor treatment
may promote cSCC tumorigenesis only in the presence of
preexisting genetic lesions. Several common tumor suppressor

mutations have been identiﬁed in cSCCs from patients treated
with RAF inhibitors, including TP53, CDKN2A, and VHL (4, 11).
In addition to host mutations, the contribution of viral oncogenes has also been implicated in cSCC tumorigenesis. The
majority of nonmelanocytic lesions occurring in vemurafenibtreated patients include several benign skin lesions with strong
associations with HPV, including venereal warts and verrucous
papillomas (5), which strongly implicates a role for HPV.
Although the frequency is low, expression of HPV capsid
protein has been observed in one cSCC from a patient treated
with the RAF inhibitor dabrafenib (22), and HPV DNA was
observed in a separate case study (23).
To determine whether an HPV infection may contribute to
cutaneous tumor initiation in patients treated with vemurafenib, 62 benign or malignant cutaneous lesions from 44
patients were collected and tested for the presence of HPV
DNA. Eight of the lesions (13%) tested positive for one of six
HPV types (Fig. 2), indicating that HPV may contribute in a
subset of cases. Because HPV can also be found on normal skin
and may be considered commensal with human tissue, we
tested several tumors from the same patients, including normal skin samples when possible. In four cases, patients with

HPV-positive tumors also had additional skin tumors or
normal skin samples that were HPV negative. In one patient,
two different HPV types (HPV9 and 49) were found in two
distinct skin tumors, whereas three additional tumors from the
same patient were negative for HPV DNA. Additional indirect
evidence of a viral contribution was observed in several HPVnegative tumors. Koilocyte-like cells were observed in papillated epidermal hyperplasia with a thickening of the granular
layer, as commonly seen in viral warts (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Because RAS mutations frequently occur in vemurafenibinduced patient tumors, each tumor was also genotyped for
HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS mutations. As shown in Fig. 2A, 10
(16%) RAS mutations (5 HRAS and 5 KRAS mutations) were
identiﬁed, which is approximately equivalent to the frequency
of HPV-positive tissues. Although HPV DNA did not seem to
associate with any histologic category, HRAS mutations were
only observed in keratoacanthomas and KRAS mutations were
exclusive to verrucous papillomas. Interestingly, co-occurrence of a RAS mutation and HPV was only observed for one
HRAS-mutated keratoacanthoma (Fig. 2B), suggesting that if
HPV infection contributes to tumor initiation in vemurafenibtreated patients, it primarily occurs independent of RAS
mutations.

cSCC and/or premalignant phenotypes. However, the frequency of cSCC was signiﬁcantly increased from 22% in
vehicle-treated mice to 70% in the 60 mg/kg vemurafenib
cohort (Fig. 3B and C).
To test for the presence of Ras ocnogenes, cSCCs were
collected from both vemurafenib-treated and untreated K14HPV16 mice and genomic exons were sequenced. Somewhat
surprisingly, 100% (9/9) of vemurafenib na€ve tumors
sequenced carried an activating Ras mutation, eight of which
were Kras mutated, and 1 Hras (Q61L) mutated (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that a Ras oncogene is required for cSCC in this
model. However, only 44% (4/9) of the cSCCs from vemurafenib-treated mice were Ras mutated (Fig. 3D), suggesting
that the increase in cSCC frequency is due to an increase of
Ras wild-type tumors. Tumors from both vehicle- and vemurafenib-treated mice were also stained for ERK phosphorylation, and areas of every tumor stained positive (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that K14-HPV16 cSCC requires ERK
activation. However, no other Ras activating mutations and
no other known oncogenes were observed in the vemurafenib-treated, Ras wild-type tumors. Nor did any set of mutations distinguish Ras wild-type cSCC from Ras-mutated or
vehicle-treated cSCC.

Vemurafenib promotes Ras wild-type tumorigenesis in
K14-HPV16 mice
To test whether vemurafenib can promote cSCC tumorigenesis in HPV-infected keratinocytes, we used a transgenic
mouse model that expresses the HPV16 early genes from the
keratin 14 promoter (K14-HPV16; ref. 14). These mice exhibit
epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and many develop
cSCCs and keratoacanthoma-like tumors. To our knowledge,
no mutations have been described in spontaneous K14HPV16 cSCCs. Tumor-free mice between 5 and 7 months
old were treated daily with vemurafenib and tumor volume
was monitored for 60 days. Activation of the MAPK pathway
in epidermis was both time and dose dependent. Low doses
(15 and 30 mg/kg) of vemurafenib moderately increased
dermal Dusp6 expression only at early time points, whereas
60 mg/kg showed sustained increase in Dusp6 expression at
12 and even 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 3A). Neither the 15
nor 30 mg/kg cohort signiﬁcantly changed the frequency of

K14-HPV16 cSCC is MEK dependent
These sequencing data suggest that the requirement for a
Ras mutation in K14-HPV16 cSCC is bypassed by vemurafenib
treatment. Conceivably, cSCC in this model requires the MAPK
pathway activation, which occurs frequently through a Ras
mutation, but can also occur through paradoxical activation of
ERK signaling in vemurafenib-treated mice. If correct, then
blockade of the MAPK pathway downstream of RAF should
prevent the increased incidence of cSCC caused by vemurafenib. Consistent with this hypothesis, cotreatment of a RAF
and MEK inhibitor in clinical trials reduced the frequency of
squamous cancers compared with RAF inhibitor treatment
alone (24). To test whether this is also true for K14-HPV16
cSCC, mice were treated with a combination of vemurafenib
and a MEK inhibitor, PD0325901. Dusp6 mRNA expression
was elevated in vemurafenib-treated skin, and reduced to
background levels by PD0325901 (Fig. 4A), showing that 3
mg/kg PD0325901 is sufﬁcient to prevent any paradoxical

60 mg/kg vemurafenib and 3 mg/kg PD0325901 also signiﬁcantly reduced the frequency of cSCC from 70% in vemurafenib-treated mice to 17% in vemurafenib þ PD0325901-treated
mice (Fig. 4B). However, none of the mice treated with
PD0325901 as a single agent developed cSCCs during the study,
suggesting that MEK inhibition prevents cSCC tumor initiation
in K14-HPV16 mice.
To test whether MEK activity is required for tumor maintenance, mice with established spontaneous cSCC were treated
with PD0325901 for 2 weeks and tumor volume was monitored.
There were ﬁve of eight partial responses (PR) and two
complete responses (CR) in the 3 mg/kg cohort, and all of the
mice treated with 10 mg/kg PD0325901 showed a complete
response after 2 weeks (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig.
S4). Both cohorts had reduced pERK staining within the tumor,
though pERK partially returned after 5 hours in tumors treated
with 3 mg/kg, yet remained suppressed in tumors treated with
10 mg/kg (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the higher response rate is
due to sustained MEK inhibition. Together, these results
strongly indicate that MEK activity is required for cSCC tumor
maintenance.

Discussion
Although it is known that RAF inhibitors accelerate RASmutant tumor growth, it is unclear why roughly 40% to 80% of
cSCCs from patients treated with vemurafenib are RAS wildtype (11, 13). In the present study, vemurafenib not only
increased the incidence and accelerated tumorigenesis, but
also clearly induced Ras wild-type cSCC in K14-HPV16 mice
(Fig. 3C and D). This suggests that vemurafenib is required for
initiation of cSCC in Ras wild-type cells, and may then explain
the emergence of Ras wild-type cSCC in RAF inhibitor-treated
patients. Also consistent with the clinical observations (24),
cotreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 prevented
vemurafenib-induced cSCC (Fig. 4B). Moreover, treatment of
established cSCC with PD0325901 caused tumor regression
(Fig. 5), demonstrating that MAPK activity is not only required
for initiation, but also for cSCC maintenance. However, it is
important to note that vemurafenib-induced cSCC was only
observed in K14-HPV16 transgenic mice, and not in HPV
negative, nontransgenic littermates. Therefore, treatment with
vemurafenib alone, although sufﬁcient to paradoxically activate the MAPK pathway in mouse dermis, and necessary for
Ras wild-type tumorigenesis in K14-HPV16 mice, was not
sufﬁcient to initiate cSCC. Clearly loss of tumor suppressor

function is a minimum requirement for vemurafenib-induced
cSCC.
HPV has been linked to cancer progression for decades due
to the transformation potential of HPV oncogenes. HPV has
been observed in both mucosal and cutaneous tumors, though
the mechanism of oncogenesis likely differs. Cervical and head
and neck cancers are clearly linked to a-HPV genotypes, which
exhibit mucosal tropism, whereas b-HPVs are more frequently

associated with cutaneous disease. Although the mechanism of
transformation for b-HPV is not fully understood, transgenic
mouse studies demonstrate that keratinocyte-speciﬁc expression of either the HPV8 (b-HPV) or HPV16 (a-HPV) genes can
promote cSCC in the FVB/N background (14, 25). In addition,
although expression of HPV transcripts can be seen in established cervical cancers, expression of HPV genes is often
undetectable even in cSCC from HPV-positive patients (26),

indicating that HPV does not play an active role in cSCC tumor
maintenance. Data presented here demonstrate that a subsequent Ras mutation is also required for HPV16-driven tumorigenesis in the K14-HPV16 model (Fig. 3D). These data are
consistent with the function of HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes,
which target P53 and pRB tumor suppressors to prevent the
DNA damage response, and implicate HPV in cSCC initiation
rather than tumor maintenance. Although it is unclear whether
b-HPV initiate transformation through a similar mechanism,
27% (6/22) of cSCC from K14-HPV8 transgenic mice develop a
spontaneous Hras mutation (27), compared with 11% (1/9) in
the HPV16 model (Fig. 3D). Further investigation in b-HPV
models may therefore reveal common mechanisms of
oncogenesis.
These data therefore elucidate a synergy between premalignant, HPV-infected tissues, and paradoxical MAPK activation in patients treated with RAF inhibitors. HPV oncoproteins likely promote tumor initiation by increasing the
frequency of premalignant mutations, whereas paradoxical
activation of the MAPK pathway promotes both initiation
and maintenance in patients treated with RAF inhibitors.
Because most of the human population tests positive for
cutaneous HPV (28), the majority of patients treated with
RAF inhibitors are likely susceptible. Although only 18% to
30% of patients treated develop cSCC and/or keratoacanthoma (2, 3), these ﬁgures may underrepresent the
frequency of RAF inhibitor-induced tumorigenesis. In a
separate study of 42 patients, 100% presented with at least
one adverse skin reaction, and the most common events
were verrucous papillomas (79%; ref. 5). Patients who develop cutaneous tumors frequently acquire multiple primary
lesions, which can affect entire limbs or chest (29, 30), a
phenotype consistent with an infectious disease. Furthermore, the pathology of tumors is also not limited to cSCC
and keratoacanthoma. Cases of pilaris-like eruptions,
acantholytic dyskeratosis, verrucous keratosis, cystic lesions,
papules, verrucous papillomas, and basal cell carcinomas

have been documented (29–33) but were not reported as
adverse events in the clinical trials (2, 3). The diversity
of cutaneous lesions observed in patients treated with
RAF inhibitors may also reﬂect the presence of multiple
oncoviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus (23), or
multiple unrecognized HPV genotypes that each require
MAPK activation for tumorigenesis. Disruption of ERK activation in these tissues by combining MEK and RAF inhibitors therefore seems to be an effective strategy to treat
BRAFV600E-mutant melanomas, and to prevent spontaneous
cutaneous tumors concurrently.
