Abstract
One subclass of antiestrogens, the selective estrogen receptor
down-regulators (SERDs), have received considerable attention of late as they competitively inhibit estrogen binding
and induce a rapid, proteasome-dependent degradation of
the receptor. Contained within this class of molecules is the
steroidal antiestrogen ICI182,780 (faslodex), recently approved
for the treatment of metastatic cancer, and GW5638/DPC974,
a SERD that is currently being evaluated in the clinic. Given
that mechanistic differences between different selective
estrogen receptor modulators have been translated into
important clinical profiles, it was of interest to determine if
the SERD subclass of ligands were likewise functionally or
mechanistically distinguishable. In this study, we show that
although the steroidal and nonsteroidal SERDs target ERA for
degradation, the underlying mechanism(s) are different. Of
note was the identification of a specific protein-protein interaction surface presented on ERA in the presence of the
ICI182,780-activated receptor which is required for degradation. Interestingly, this surface is also presented on ERA in the
presence of RU58,668, a SERD that is chemically distinct from
ICI182,780. This surface is not required for GW5638-mediated
degradation, and thus, this SERD seems to affect ERA downregulation by a different mechanism. These data suggest that
sequencing of therapies using drugs of this class is likely to be
possible. Finally, because of the unmet need for orally active
SERDS that function similarly to ICI182,780, we have used the
insights from these mechanistic studies to develop and
validate a high-throughput screen for compounds of this class
with improved pharmaceutical properties. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The biological actions of estrogens are manifested through two
high-affinity estrogen receptors, ERa and ERh, which are expressed
at different levels in target cells (1–3). In the absence of their
cognate hormones, these receptors reside in the cytoplasm or
nuclei of target cells associated with an inhibitory heat-shock protein complex (4). After binding estrogen, they undergo activating
conformational changes that lead to the displacement of heatshock proteins, an event that facilitates the formation of receptor
homodimers or heterodimers and their subsequent interaction
with specific DNA response elements within the regulatory regions

of target genes. The DNA-bound receptor can then either positively
or negatively regulate target gene transcription. Alternate nongenomic pathways by which estrogen-activated ERa or ERh can
activate signaling processes at the membrane or in the cytoplasm
have been identified, although the physiologic significance of these
responses remains controversial (5).
Although generally considered a reproductive hormone, the
expression of these ERs in nonreproductive tissues indicates that
the regulatory actions of estrogens extend beyond reproduction
(6, 7). Not surprisingly, therefore, pharmaceuticals that both positively and negatively regulate ER action are widely used in the
clinic. Outside the realm of normal physiology, however, it has been
shown that the majority of breast tumors express ERa and are
responsive to the mitogenic actions of estrogen(s) (ref. 8). Furthermore, it has been shown that signaling pathways, initiated at
the cell membrane, can impinge on ERa positively, regulating its
activity in the presence or absence of exogenous estrogens (9).
A protective role of ERh in breast cancer cells has been inferred
from studies done in vitro, although its role(s) in tumor pathology
has not been determined (10–12). Regardless, the clinical benefit of
disrupting estrogen signaling in the breast using antiestrogens,
compounds that competitively inhibit estrogen binding to ERa, or
aromatase inhibitors, compounds that block estrogen production,
are well established (13). Although it has recently become clear that
aromatase inhibitors are superior to antiestrogens as first-line
hormonal interventions in metastatic breast cancer, the chronic
nature of the disease makes it likely that both types of drugs will
play a role in the management of this disease (13–15). Not
surprisingly, therefore, a considerable amount of attention is now
being paid to the development of different sequencing regimens
that may provide increased therapeutic benefit. Therefore, interest
in identifying new antiestrogens with unique mechanisms of action
has increased considerably over the past few years.
The currently available antiestrogens fall into two general classes
(a) selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as
tamoxifen, and (b) selective estrogen receptor down-regulators
(SERDs), such as the pure antiestrogen faslodex (ICI182,780; ref. 13).
Tamoxifen functions by competitively displacing estradiol from the
receptor, disrupting the primary coactivator-binding pocket on the
receptor and blocking the access of ER, activated by residual
estrogens, to its target gene promoters. The SERDs share these
attributes with tamoxifen but, in addition, they induce a rapid and
quantitative down-regulation of ERa (14, 16). It is likely that it is
the latter activity which is responsible for the dramatic results
observed in patients treated with faslodex who have failed at
least one endocrine therapy and which has made it a first-in-class
SERD approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer
(16–19). Although clinical studies have shown some success with
faslodex, its poor pharmacodynamic properties and lack of oral
bioavailability have limited its clinical utility (16–20). Thus,
although faslodex has provided very important proof-of-concept
information, it is clear that there is an unmet medical need for (a)

faslodex-like compounds with improved pharmaceutical properties
and (b) other SERDs/antiestrogens with distinct mechanisms of
action. The rationale for the continued development of novel
classes of ER antagonists has been detailed recently in several
comprehensive reviews (21, 22). For this reason, we have undertaken a comparative study of the mechanism of action of faslodex
and that of GW5638/DPC974, a chemically distinct SERD with a
view to developing mechanism-based screens that will allow the
identification of new antiestrogens (23–25).

Materials and Methods
Plasmids, chemicals, and antibodies. Plasmids were previously
described (26–28) or constructed through site-directed mutagenesis
(QuickChange kit; Stratagene), PCR amplification, restriction enzyme
subcloning, and/or ‘‘Gateway’’ LR reactions (Invitrogen). More detailed
instructions on plasmid construction are available on request. 17h-Estradiol
(E2), 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (TOT), dexamethasone, and 9-cis-retinoic acid
were purchased from Sigma. Raloxifene, EM-652, GW7604, RU58-668, and
RU486 were provided as gifts from Dr. E. Larson (Pfizer, Inc., Groton, CT),
Dr. Fernand Labrie (CHUL Research Center, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada),
Dr. T. Willson (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), Michel
Renoir (UMR Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France), and
Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (San Diego, CA), respectively. ICI182,780 was
obtained from Tocris. Casodex was provided by GlaxoSmithKline. R1881
and R5020 were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Antibodies
used included ERa, lamin A, a-tubulin, cytokeratin 18, and GAL4-DBD
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), V5 (Invitrogen), and anti–enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) polyclonal antibody (Clontech).
ERA protein and RNA levels. MCF7 cells were maintained in DMEM/
F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone),
0.1 mmol/L of nonessential amino acids, and 1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate
(Invitrogen). MCF7 cells were plated in six-well dishes at 500,000 cells per
well containing phenol red–free DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5%
charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 36 h. Cells were subsequently
treated with either vehicle or 100 nmol/L of ERa ligand for the times
indicated in Fig. 1. Whole cell lysates were harvested by boiling the cells in
Laemmli buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis.
Following ligand treatments, ERa mRNA levels were detected by quantitative PCR using primers specific to ERa and normalized to 36B4 mRNA
levels.
Cell fractionation and analysis. MCF7 cells were plated as previously
described and subsequently treated with either vehicle, 100 nmol/L of E2,
ICI182,780, or GW7604 for the times specified in Fig. 2. Cells were harvested
and cell pellets were resuspended on ice for 15 min in 100 AL of cytoplasmic
extraction buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA] containing protease inhibitor cocktail set III
(Calbiochem). Cells were permeabilized by adding IGEPAL (Sigma) to 0.63%
total volume, vortexed for 10 s, and centrifuged for 1 min to obtain
the cytoplasmic extract. To obtain soluble nuclear extracts, nuclear pellets
were resuspended on ice for 20 min in 100 AL of nuclear extract buffer
(20 mmol/L HEPES, 25% total volume glycerol, 0.4 mol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, and 1 mmol/L EGTA) with protease inhibitors, and centrifuged for
5 min. The remaining pellets were sequentially extracted in nuclear matrix
digestion buffer containing protease inhibitors and DNase I (Roche),
0.25 mol/L of ammonium sulfate, and finally, 2.0 mol/L of NaCl as previously
described (29), and combined to a total volume of 100 AL to compose
the detergent-extractable nuclear matrix fraction. The remaining insoluble fraction was solubilized in 100 AL of 95% Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad)
with 5% h-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 95jC for 20 min. The protein concentration of the cytoplasmic extracts was determined and the
volume constituting 100 Ag of cytoplasmic extract was analyzed by SDSPAGE. In addition, equivalent volumes of the nuclear extract, detergentextractable nuclear matrix, and insoluble fractions were loaded. Proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western
analysis.

T7 phage display. mRNA was obtained from HepG2, MCF7, and HEC1B
cells using the Straight A’s mRNA kit (Novagen). T7 phage libraries were
constructed using OrientExpress cDNA kit and T7 Select kit according to
the instructions of the manufacturer (Novagen). Costar 96-well plates were
coated with 20 Ag of neutravidin in 100 AL of 100 mmol/L NaHCO3
overnight at 4jC. Plates were blocked with 150 AL of 2% milk in 100 mmol/L
of NaHCO3 for 1 h at room temperature, then washed five times with PBST
(PBS + 0.1% Tween 20). Two picomoles of biotinylated double-stranded
DNA composed of the vitellogenin estrogen receptor response element in
PBST were applied to each well for 1 h at room temperature and excess
neutravidin was subsequently blocked for another hour with 10 AL of
1 mmol/L biotin. Wells were washed five times with PBST and f0.25 Ag
of baculovirus-expressed recombinant ERa (Affinity Bioreagents) in 100 AL
of PBST containing vehicle or 1 Amol/L of ERa ligand was added to each
well and incubated overnight at 4jC. After washing, wells were blocked with
150 AL of 2% milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and
subsequently incubated with 1  108 plaque-forming units of T7 library
in 100 AL of PBST containing vehicle or 1 Amol/L of ERa ligand for 1 h at
room temperature. Following five washes with PBST, bound phages were
eluted in a DNase elution mix (99 AL PBST, 0.5 AL of 1 mol/L MgCl2, and
0.5 AL of 10 mg/mL DNase I) for 1 h at room temperature. Eluted phages
were amplified in a 10 mL culture of Escherichia coli BLT5615 cells induced
with 1 mmol/L of isopropyl-h-D-thiogalactopyranoside until complete
bacterial lysis occurred. Amplified phages were harvested following
centrifugation and applied to a new plate containing ERa. After five
rounds of panning, phage ELISAs were done to verify affinity enrichment of
ERa-interacting phages. Specifically, amplified phages (100 AL/well) were
added to wells containing ERa for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound
phages were washed away and wells were incubated with 150 AL of a 1:5,000
dilution of anti–T7-HRP (Novagen) in PBST for 1 h at room temperature.
After thoroughly washing the wells, bound phages were detected by
incubating the wells with 100 AL of 2¶-2¶-azino-bis-ethylbenzthiazoline6-sulfonic acid in the presence of 0.05% H2O2 and the color change was
measured at 405 nmol/L with a plate reader (Multiskan MS; Labsystems). T7
phages from the rounds with the highest enrichment of ERa-interacting
phages were plaque-purified and clones were randomly selected for PCR
amplification of the cDNA inserts using T7 select UP and DOWN primer
(Novagen). The inserts were sequenced, translated, and corresponding
proteins were identified using the BLASTp program (National Center for
Biotechnology Information).
Mammalian two-hybrid assays. HepG2 cells were maintained, plated,
and transfected and mammalian two-hybrid assays were done as previously
described (27).
ERA mutant degradation analysis. HeLa cells were maintained as
previously described (30). For transient transfection and Western analysis of
ERa, ERa mutants, and ERh, HeLa cells were plated in six-well dishes
containing phenol red–free media supplemented with 8% charcoal-stripped
fetal bovine serum at 500,000 cells per well for 24 h. Cells were subsequently
transfected with 1.5 Ag of pEGFP, 0.3 Ag of CMV-h-gal, and 1.5 Ag of pCDNA
3.1-V5-ERa, -ERa mutant, or ERh using Fugene (Roche) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer for 24 h, and subsequently treated with
vehicle or 100 nmol/L of ICI182,780 for 3 h. HeLa cells were harvested and
cell pellets were resuspended and mechanically disrupted by pipetting in
low salt/low detergent radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [100 mmol/L
Tris (pH 8.3), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.02% SDS, 0.5% IGEPAL, and 150 mmol/L
NaCl] containing protease inhibitors, and incubating on ice for 10 min.
Soluble fractions were harvested and insoluble pellets were solubilized in an
equivalent amount of Laemlli buffer as previously described. Soluble protein
lysates were subjected to h-gal assays, and protein volumes were loaded
based on h-gal expression and subjected to Western analysis as previously
described.
Antiestrogen-interacting peptide and control adenovirus construction and expression. GAL4-DBD–antiestrogen interacting peptide (AEIP)
and GAL4-DBD-control (AEIP mutated within the ERa-binding region)
adenoviruses were generated using the ‘‘Gateway’’ ViraPower Adenoviral
Expression System according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen)
and purified using the Vira Bind Adenovirus Purification Kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Cell BioLabs, Inc.).

Figure 2. Subcellular compartmentalization of ERa upon binding ICI182,780 is distinct from that observed in the presence of GW7604 and E2. MCF7 cells were grown
as described in Materials and Methods and treated with either vehicle, 100 nmol/L of E2, 100 nmol/L of ICI182,780, or 100 nmol/L of GW7604 for the time periods
indicated. Following treatment, the cells were harvested and lysed to obtain separate soluble cytoplasmic fractions (C ), soluble nuclear fractions (N), soluble
DNase/0.25 mol/L ammonium sulfate/2 mol/L NaCl fractions (D ), and remaining insoluble fractions (I ) as described in Materials and Methods. Fractions were subjected
to Western analysis to detect ERa, a-tubulin (C fraction control), lamin A (N, D, I fraction controls), and cytokeratin 18 (loading and C and I fraction controls).

To measure the effects of adenovirally expressed AEIP on ERa
translocation, MCF7 cells were plated at 500,000 cells per well in six-well
dishes as previously described for 24 to 48 h. Cells were incubated with
either pAD-DEST-GAL4-DBD-AEIP or -control virus at a multiplicity of
infection of 150 in 500 AL of media for 2 h at room temperature. Following
the 2 h incubation, 2 mL of media were added to the cells and the cells
were returned to 37jC. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were treated with
vehicle or 100 nmol/L of E2, ICI182,780, or GW7604 for the specified time
periods. Cells were harvested and subjected to low salt/low detergent
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer–mediated cell lysis. Soluble and
insoluble extracts were subjected to Western analysis as previously
described.

Results
There is a high level of interest in developing SERDs, a
subclass of antiestrogens that both disrupt ERa-cofactor
interactions and induce receptor turnover in cells. This interest
is driven primarily by the observation that a compound of this
pharmacologic class, ICI182,780 ( faslodex), has shown remarkable
efficacy as a second-line treatment for tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancers (17). Little is known, however, about the mechanism(s) by
which ERa degradation is accomplished upon interacting with
SERDs, an impediment to the development of molecules with

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

improved therapeutic properties. Thus, the primary objective of
this study was to define the characteristics of compounds that
enable them to induce ERa turnover and determine if chemically
distinct SERDs function in a similar manner. As a first step in
addressing this issue, we examined the stability of endogenous
ERa in MCF-7 cells following treatment with either estradiol or
selected SERMs and SERDs (Fig. 1A). Specifically, total ERa
protein and mRNA expression levels were examined in cells
following acute (4 h) or chronic (48 h) treatments with each
compound (Fig. 1B and C). Western immunoblots and quantitative densitometry were used to measure ERa protein levels. Not
surprisingly, no ERa protein was recovered from cells following
4 h of treatment with estradiol (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, with the
exception of TOT, all of the other ligands tested reduced ERa
levels in cells albeit with different efficacies and these changes
could not be attributed to changes in ERa mRNA levels. Most
notably, ICI182,780 and the higher affinity 4-hydroxylated
metabolite of GW5638 (GW7604) were as effective as estradiol
in this acute experiment. No additional down-regulation of ERa
protein was observed following extended (48 h chronic) treatment
with either raloxifene or EM652 (Fig. 1C). However, a significant
increase in ERa levels was observed when TOT-treated cells were
examined at this time point. The reappearance of ERa in the cells

Mechanism-Based Distinction of SERDs

treated for 48 h suggests that, despite the presence of saturating
amounts of estradiol, constitutive suppression of ERa levels by this
ligand was not achievable. However, both ICI182,780 and GW7604
distinguished themselves from the other ER ligands examined in this
assay as they permitted a robust and sustained suppression of ERa
protein levels and this rapid loss of receptor could not be solely
attributed to decreased ERa mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). Given these
findings, we proceeded to determine whether or not these two
compounds achieved the end point of receptor turnover in the same
manner.
The SERDs ICI182,780 and GW7604 have differential effects
on subcellular localization of ERA. It has been shown previously
that although treatment with either estradiol or ICI182,780 results
in a quantitative down-regulation of ERa in cells, the mechanism(s)
by which this occurs is not the same (30–32). Most notable is the
observation that these compounds have discrete effects on
receptor compartmentalization, which precedes the degradation
of the receptor (33–36). This suggests that different ligand-induced
changes in the structure of ERa result in the receptor entering
the proteolytic pathways through alternate mechanisms. We were
interested in determining if the distinct cellular compartmentalization of ERa, observed following treatment with ICI182,780, was
a hallmark of SERDs or if it was specific to this steroidal antagonist.
To this end, we compared the kinetics of receptor distribution in
MCF-7 cells following treatment with vehicle alone, estradiol, or
with the SERDs ICI182,780 or GW7604. The treated cells were
harvested and cellular extracts were fractioned into soluble
cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear, soluble DNase/ammonium sulfate/
high NaCl treated, and the remaining insoluble fraction (Fig. 2). In
this manner, it was observed that ERa was found in either the
cytoplasmic or insoluble fractions following treatment with vehicle
(Fig. 2A–C). Treatment of cells with estradiol resulted in a higher
recovery of ERa in the soluble nuclear and DNase/ammonium
sulfate/high NaCl fractions at earlier time points with progressively
more receptor associating with the insoluble fraction as the
duration of exposure increased (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the
ICI182,780-occupied ERa was found to associate predominantly
with the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2B). Using the same approach, we
observed that the localization pattern for receptors treated with
GW7604 was quite similar to that observed for estradiol and
surprisingly distinct from the ICI182,780-treated receptor (Fig. 2C).
Lamin A (nuclear) and a-tubulin (cytoplasmic) were measured in
all extracts to assess the effectiveness of the fractionation protocol
and to verify that these ligands did not have a nonspecific effect on
protein compartmentalization. Thus, although ICI182,780 and
GW7604 are classified as SERDs, they do not have the same effect
on the compartmentalization of ERa within the cell. Although it is
not possible to infer from this data that ICI182,780 and GW7604dependent ERa turnover is related in any way to cellular
localization, it does indicate that the cell does not handle the
receptor in the same manner when occupied by these different
SERDs. We conclude from these studies that the rapid repartitioning of ICI182,780-treated ERa from a soluble to an insoluble
fraction precedes degradation and is a unique characteristic of this
subclass of SERDs.
ERA adopts a unique structural conformation in the
presence of ICI182,780. It is now generally accepted that many
of the functional differences exhibited by different ER ligands are
related to (a) their ability to induce distinct alterations in receptor
structure and (b) the ability of differently conformed receptors to
engage different cofactors in target cells. We inferred, therefore,

www.aacrjournals.org

that if the SERDs ICI182,780 and GW7604 are indeed mechanistically distinct, as the data presented in Fig. 2 indicates, then the
structure of the receptor in the presence of these molecules should
be sufficiently different so as to enable the differential engagement
of cofactors. This idea is supported by our previous observation
that the degree of hydrophobicity exhibited by the ERa ligandbinding domain is not equivalent in the ICI182,780 and GW7604
complexes (23). Thus, we next examined whether or not these two
mechanistically distinct SERDs induce different structural alterations in ERa. To address this issue, we used combinatorial T7
phage display to screen random peptide and cDNA expression
libraries for peptides/proteins that interact in a specific manner
with ICI182,780-activated ERa. This was accomplished using
purified ERa immobilized in plastic to select for phages expressing
either an interacting peptide or cofactor. Interestingly, although
this approach led to the identification of a large number of
peptides and proteins that interacted with estradiol-activated ERa
(data not shown), we identified only a single peptide (AEIP) that
interacted specifically with the ICI182,780/ERa complex. Further
characterization of the receptor-interacting properties of this
peptide was done using a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3). For
this assay, we expressed AEIP as a fusion protein with the GAL4DBD and assessed its ability to interact with a full-length VP16-ERa
fusion protein in the presence of different ligands. The results of
this analysis indicate that this peptide recognizes a surface
presented on the ICI182,780/ERa complex that is not present on
the receptor when it is occupied by GW7604 (a SERD) or other
SERMs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, and EM-652; Fig. 3A). Furthermore,
we showed that the interaction of AEIP with ERa could be reversed
by the addition of increasing concentrations of estradiol, confirming that ICI182,780 and estradiol-activated ERa are structurally
distinct (Fig. 3B). Finally, GAL4-DBD-AEIP did not interact with any
of the other nuclear receptors that were tested, including both the
long (amino acids 1–530) and short (amino acids 1–477) VP16-ERh
isoforms (Fig. 3C). This was an extremely important result, as we
and others have shown that ERh expression is not influenced by
ICI182,780 (37). These data provide compelling evidence that
potentially, a specific surface on ERa, presented upon binding
ICI182,780, results in distinct receptor re-compartmentalization
and subsequent degradation. Thus, within the confines of the
resolution of this assay, we conclude that the structure of
ICI182,780-activated ERa is distinct from the nonsteroidal
antiestrogens evaluated in this assay.
Sequence analysis of AEIP revealed that it was composed of a
total of 42 amino acids (Fig. 3D). In order to define the ERainteracting domain of this extended peptide, we sequentially
mutated six amino acid regions across the entire sequence using a
NAAIRS replacement strategy (38). A schematic illustrating the
regions mutated is shown in Fig. 3D. When the AEIP NAAIRS
mutants were used in M2H assays, it was observed that the amino
acids within region 5 were responsible for the interaction with ERa
(Fig. 3D). This region contained a high number of hydrophobic
amino acids, which is interesting given that E2-bound ERa has a
high affinity for the hydrophobic amino acid sequence LxxLL found
in coactivator proteins (26, 39, 40). To further determine which of
the six amino acids were required for the interaction, each amino
acid was individually mutated to alanine (A) or in combination at
positions 1 and 2 because we thought it was possible these
hydrophobic amino acids might compensate for one another. M2H
assays revealed that the last three amino acids (S28, P29, and M30)
were key amino acids involved in the interaction (Fig. 3D). Thus,

Conformation as a predictor of ERA stability. Over the past
few years, it has become apparent that there is a strong
relationship between the structure of an ER-ligand complex
and resultant biological activity (26, 27, 39–41). Thus, we felt
that it was likely that any compound that facilitates the interaction of AEIP with ERa would induce its turnover. To test this

hypothesis, we used a mammalian two-hybrid assay as a primary
screen to identify from a library of ER ligands those that could
facilitate the interaction of ERa with AEIP. Only a single
compound, the pure antiestrogen RU58,668, facilitated a significant interaction of ERa with AEIP (Supplemental Fig. S1A; ref. 42).
As expected, RU58,668 induced a rapid and sustained decrease
in ERa protein levels that could not be attributed to a decrease
in ERa mRNA levels alone (Supplemental Fig. S1B and C). These

and stability and provide the validation for a mechanism-based

Definition of the functional significance of the AEIP binding
surface on ERA. It is our assumption that the surfaces presented
on ERa in the presence of ICI182,780 allow its interaction with
specific proteins that target it for degradation. As of yet, we have
been unable to identify proteins that are capable of interacting
with this specific receptor-ligand complex, and thus, are unable to
test this hypothesis directly. Furthermore, because the crystal
structure of ERa in the presence of ICI182,780 has not yet been
solved, we have had to rely on mutagenesis to determine what
region and amino acids of ERa constitute the AEIP interaction
surface(s). This is an important next step in understanding the
mechanism of action of this class of SERDs as it will hopefully lead
to the definition of the mechanistic link between ERa conformation and stability. The goal in the next series of studies, therefore,
was to characterize the AEIP interaction domain on ERa and
determine if this region is directly involved in the regulation of
receptor stability or if its presentation is merely a surrogate for
more functionally important structural alterations that occur at
another surface on the protein.
In the first series of studies, we compared the effect of a series
of receptor mutations, created in the background of VP16-ERa,
on the receptor-binding activities of AEIP (Fig. 4A). These specific
mutations were selected as they have previously been shown to
alter the interaction of ERa with coactivators and corepressors
(26, 27, 39, 43). For comparative purposes, we also examined the
interaction of these mutants with (a) the NR-box of SRC-1 and (b)
a peptide that interacts with tamoxifen-activated ERa (Fig. 4B
and C; ref. 27). As observed in Fig. 4A, the interaction of AEIP
with ICI182,780-bound ERa was abrogated when the amino acid
I358 within helix 3, L379 in helix 5, and the hydrophobic amino
acids of helix 12 were mutated. Interestingly, with the exception
of amino acid K362, which mediates a capping interaction with
LxxLL-containing coactivators (i.e., SRC1), the mutations shown
to abrogate the interaction of AEIP with ICI182,780-bound ERa
were the same as those necessary for E2-induced interaction of
the SRC1 NRID (peptide region of SRC1 containing all three
LxxLL; Fig. 4A and B; ref. 39). These mutant receptors were
capable of interacting with a peptide that binds to ERa in a
ligand-independent manner, indicating that the selected amino
acid changes did not induce a global alteration in receptor

structure (data not shown). We have previously identified a
peptide (bT1) whose binding surface is presented only on
tamoxifen-activated ERa (27). Analysis of the effects of the
selected mutants on the interaction of this peptide with ERa has
led us to conclude that the surfaces presented on the ICI182,780activated ERa are dramatically different from those presented
upon tamoxifen binding (Fig. 4C). Finally, Kong et al. have used
crystallography to identify a novel protein-protein interaction
domain that is presented on ERa following its interaction with
any ligand (43). The functionality of this domain is disrupted by
the G442H mutation. However, this mutation has no effect on the
interaction of the receptor with AEIP. Thus, we conclude from
these mutagenesis experiments that the conformation of ERa
adopted in the presence of estradiol and ICI182,780 are
unexpectedly quite similar. Furthermore, we consider it likely
that the AEIP and coactivator binding surfaces overlap.
The integrity of the AEIP binding site is required for
ICI182,780-mediated subcellular trafficking of ERA. The
earliest response to ICI182,780 we have observed is the repartitioning of ERa from a soluble to an insoluble fraction; an
activity that tracks with degradation (Fig. 2B). Thus, in order to
test the functional role of the AEIP binding surface directly, we
examined the cellular partitioning of each mutant in the presence
of ICI182,780 (Fig. 5). To avoid the confounding effect of
endogenous ERa that may dimerize with some of the mutants,
we did these studies in transiently transfected ERa ( ) HeLa
cells. For these studies, a V5 tag was added to the NH2 terminus
of each protein to allow quantitation by Western immunoblot. We
first confirmed that we could observe the ICI182,780-induced
subcellular compartmentalization of exogenously expressed ERa
in HeLa cells, as was observed with the endogenous receptor in
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A). In these studies, because ERa was never
observed in the soluble nuclear or DNase fractions following
ICI182,780 treatment (Fig. 2B), we only assessed its partitioning
between the low salt–soluble and low salt–insoluble fractions. As
observed previously, we did not see a decrease in total ERa levels
following 90 min of treatment, allowing us to examine the early
compartmentalization events (Fig. 5A; ref. 36). However, we did
observe a rapid loss of ERa in the low salt–soluble fractions and a
concomitant increase in insoluble receptor following 15 min of
treatment (Fig. 5A). Using this system, we proceeded to evaluate
the effect of mutating the AEIP binding site on ERa compartmentalization. To this end, we expressed ERa, ERh, or each ERa mutant
individually in HeLa cells and assessed their compartmentalization

Figure 4. ICI182,780 and E2 induce similar conformational changes within ERa as assessed by AEIP binding. Previously described mammalian two-hybrid assays
were done using VP16-ERa wild-type (WT ), ligand-binding domain (LBD), or specific mutations within the ERa ligand-binding domain previously shown to affect
either coactivator and/or corepressor binding to ERa within helix 3 (I358R, K362A), helix 5 (L372R, V376R, L379R, E380Q), G442H, and helix 12 [L540Q, 3x (D538N,

in the presence of ICI182,780 as a function of time. As can been
seen in Fig. 5B, those mutants that interacted with AEIP were all
found to rapidly associate with the insoluble fraction. In contrast,
those mutants that did not interact with AEIP failed to
recompartmentalize under the conditions of our assay. The data
presented in Fig. 5C and D represent the average level of soluble and
insoluble ERa, ERa mutants, and ERh following ICI182,780
treatment from three independent experiments. We believe that
the robust nature of this data highlights the importance of the
AEIP-interacting domain in regulating ERa trafficking, and likely,
its stability.
Expression of the AEIP peptide in cells partially inhibits
ICI182,780-mediated recompartmentalization of ERA. The
data presented thus far support the hypothesis that the AEIP
binding site on ERa is a protein-protein interaction surface
required for ICI182,780-mediated subcellular translocation. Definitive proof of this hypothesis will require the identification of the
protein(s) that use this surface; an ongoing project in our
laboratory. In the interim, however, we have tested this idea by
expressing AEIP in cells and observing the effect of this

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

manipulation on the fate of ICI182,780-occupied ERa in target
cells. Specifically, we constructed adenoviruses expressing either a
GAL4-DBD-AEIP fusion protein or a GAL4-DBD-control (AEIP
interaction domain mutant). We first confirmed that expressed
GAL4-DBD-AEIP, but not the mutant protein, interacted with ERa
using a M2H assay. For this assay, increasing amounts of viruses
expressing each protein were used to infect HeLa cells and their
ability to interact with a transiently transfected VP16-ERa was
assessed using a GAL4-RE-Luc reporter. Equivalent levels of both
proteins were expressed in cells. However, only the AEIP protein
was found to interact with ERa in an ICI182,780-dependent
manner (Fig. 6A).
We have validated the use of the recompartmentalization assay
to study the fate of ICI182,780-activated ERa, and thus, again used
this approach to assess the effect of AEIP expression on the
partitioning of endogenous ERa. To this end, we infected MCF-7
cells with viruses expressing either AEIP or the mutant and
measured ERa levels in the soluble and insoluble fractions of the
cell following treatment with different ligands. The data obtained
following 1 h of ICI182,780, shown in Fig. 6B and C, indicate that

AEIP, but not the mutant, increases the amount of ERa in the
soluble fraction and decreases its recovery from the insoluble
fraction. The levels of ERa in either compartment was unaffected
by AEIP expression following treatment with ligands other than

ICI182,780. Each assay was done thrice with similar results,
confirming the ability of AEIP to block the movement of
ICI182,780-treated ERa to the insoluble fraction. We conclude
from these experiments that AEIP recognizes a specific surface on

Figure 5. Specific amino acids responsible for the ICI182,780-bound ERa interaction with AEIP are also necessary for ICI182,780-mediated subcellular
compartmentalization. A, HeLa cells were transfected with CMV-h-gal, pEGFP, and pCDNA-V5–tagged ERa, treated with vehicle or 100 nmol/L of ICI182,780
for the specified time period, and lysed to obtain low salt–soluble and -insoluble fractions as previously described in Materials and Methods. The two fractions
were subjected to Western analysis to detect V5-tagged ERa, and EGFP. Loading was initially controlled based on h-gal expression followed by EGFP expression.
B, HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP, CMV-h-gal, and either pCDNA-V5-ERa [wild-type (WT ) or mutants] or -V5-ERh expression plasmids, treated for 3 h
with either vehicle (V ) or 100 nmol/L of ICI182,780 (ICI ), harvested and lysed as in (A). The soluble and insoluble fractions were subjected to Western analysis to detect

Cells were treated with vehicle or 100 nmol/L of

enables a protein-protein interaction required for receptor recompartmentalization, and likely, its degradation. We also conclude
that although GW7604 is a SERD and resembles ERa in its ability to
down-regulate ERa, it does so by a different mechanism as it is
unaffected by the expression of AEIP.

Discussion
The utility of the antiestrogen tamoxifen in the treatment and
prevention of breast cancer is well established (13). However, as
with most first-in-class drugs, the insights provided from years of
clinical exposure has revealed activities of this drug that may limit
its clinical utility. With respect to tamoxifen, the most notable

deficiencies are (a) de novo resistance in some ERa-positive
tumors, (b) acquired resistance with continued administration of
the drug, (c) partial agonist activity in the uterus, and (d) increased
risk of thromboembolic events (13, 21, 22). Thus, there is a high
level of interest in developing novel antiestrogens which will display
improved therapeutic activity and which will be used either in place
of, or subsequent to, tamoxifen (22). Unfortunately, despite
promising results in preclinical models, there has been relatively
little success in identifying antiestrogens that either show superior
activity to tamoxifen or which can inhibit tamoxifen-resistant
breast tumors. For instance, whereas the SERM raloxifene, a
molecule that is both chemically and functionally distinct from
tamoxifen, exhibited a favorable profile in preclinical studies, it was
shown to be ineffective as a treatment for tamoxifen refractory
metastatic breast cancer in the clinic (44). Indeed, these and other
disappointing clinical trials led to the widely held view that ERa was
not a useful therapeutic target in patients whose tumors progressed
on tamoxifen. However, this opinion was changed by the dramatic
results observed in a phase II clinical trial of ICI182,780, a SERD
(14, 16–20). The efficacy of this particular drug has been attributed
to its ability to both inhibit ER transcriptional activity and its ability
to induce receptor turnover. Given that ER can be activated in a
ligand-independent manner by signaling pathways that modulate
the receptor, or its associated cofactors, it is likely that the ability of
SERDs to induce receptor turnover is a key contributor to its clinical
efficacy (14, 16, 24, 30). Faslodex (ICI182,780) is now approved for
use in the treatment of metastatic disease, and although it is clearly
a breakthrough medicine, its clinical utility is limited by its poor
bioavailability and the length of time that it takes to achieve a useful
therapeutic concentration in target tissues (14, 18, 20, 22). It was
within the framework of this clinical problem that we embarked
several years ago on the identification of new molecules that exhibit
SERD activity. This work led to the identification of GW5638,
an orally active, nonsteroidal tamoxifen derivative, which, like
ICI182,780, facilitates a rapid turnover of ERa and effectively
inhibits the growth of tamoxifen-resistant tumors propagated in
athymic nude mice (22, 45). The current study extends this initial
work and shows that although both ICI182,780 and GW5638, and its
bioavailable metabolite GW7604 are members of the SERD subclass
of ER ligands, they effect a down-regulation of the receptor by
different mechanisms. This is an important finding as it suggests the
possibility that these drugs, or molecules with similar mechanism(s)
of action, could be used sequentially and/or they may be useful in
patients whose tumors exhibit different molecular characteristics.
Furthermore, given the limitations of ICI182,780, we considered that
by understanding its mechanism of action, we may be able to
develop predictive screens that would enable the identification of
molecules with similar activities but show improved pharmaceutical properties.
It is now well established that the pharmacologic activities of
different ER ligands are determined by the effects of each ligand on
receptor structure and the secondary effect that this has on cofactor
recruitment (26, 27, 39–41). We have previously shown, using a
variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques, that the structures of ERa in the presence of ICI182,780 or GW5638 (GW7604)
were not identical and suspected that this may translate into
important mechanistic differences, secondary to differential cofactor
recruitment (23, 24, 30). The identification of AEIP, a peptide that
interacted specifically with ICI182,780-bound ERa supports this link
between a specific molecular structure and receptor degradation.
We have also observed that RU58,668, a steroidal pure antiestrogen,

www.aacrjournals.org

also facilitates ERa-AEIP interaction and induces receptor turnover.
This important information provides compelling support for the link
between a specific ERa conformation and stability. Importantly,
AEIP did not bind to GW7604-activated ERa. However, using combinatorial peptide phage display, we have shown in the past that
the surfaces presented on GW7604 or GW5638-activated ERa are
generally not present when the receptor is occupied by ICI182,780
(24). We conclude therefore that ICI182,780 and GW5638 (GW7604)
are members of two distinct subclasses of SERDs.
Mutational analysis of AEIP identified a hydrophobic region
within the peptide that interacts with ICI182,780-bound ERa. This
was reminiscent of the hydrophobic regions of cofactors which are
known to be involved in binding to both agonist- and SERM-bound
ERa (26, 27, 39, 40). This led us to further examine the region of
ERa with which AEIP was binding. It was observed that AEIP
interacts with a similar, but slightly different, hydrophobic pocket
than that used by estrogen-bound ERa for coactivator binding and
was completely different from that used for interaction with
CoRNR box–like peptides (27, 39). This suggested that the
ICI182,780-induced conformation is more similar to that induced
by estrogen than SERMs. Furthermore, based on these studies, we
suspect that the extended sulfoxide-containing alkyl side chain of
ICI182,780 is pushing helix 12 into the coactivator binding pocket,
blocking coactivator binding but allowing for the AEIP peptide to
bind. The dependence on helix 12 within ERa for AEIP interaction
indicates why this peptide was unable to bind ICI182,780-bound
ERh. Crystal structures of ICI182,780-bound ERh have been unable
to resolve helix 12, suggesting that this region of ERh is highly
mobile and unstructured when bound to ICI182,780 (46), and thus,
it is likely that the conformation induced by steroidal SERDs within
ERa is different from that induced in ERh. Studies are under way to
crystallize ICI182,780-bound ERa in the presence of AEIP, which
should help resolve this issue.
Our studies and those published by others have shown that
following ICI182,780 treatment, ERa is rapidly translocated to a
highly insoluble, nuclear matrix–associated fraction of the cell,
whereupon it undergoes degradation (34–36). The recent demonstration that the solubility of ERa bound to ICI182,780 is influenced
by the integrity of helix 12 supports the conclusions of our studies
(36, 47). However, we have shown that additional mutations within
the ligand-binding domain of ERa that disrupt AEIP-binding alter
receptor compartmentalization and increase its stability. Specifically, we have shown that helices 3 and 5 are also involved in ERa/
ICI182,780 complex and the binding of AEIP. In addition, these
findings support the existence of an endogenous protein, containing a motif similar to that observed in AEIP, that regulates the
trafficking and stability of the receptor. This hypothesis was further
supported by the observation that expression of AEIP in cells was
able to partially block ICI182,780-mediated turnover of ERa.
Computational analysis using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST program resulted in the identification of
only one protein (ZMYM4) with an exact match to the AEIP motif
(VPNSPM). In addition, a large number of many unknown proteins,
and some known to be potentially involved in cellular trafficking
such as trafficking kinesin-binding protein 1, were identified as
containing the PNSPM sequence. It will be of interest to determine
if any of these proteins are involved in determining the molecular
pharmacology of ICI182,780. Regardless, the identification of AEIP
and the demonstration that its binding determined the fate of ERa
has, at a minimum, provided a facile assay for the identification of
novel ICI,182,780-like SERDs.

In summary, we have determined that the currently available
SERDs can be divided into two mechanistically distinct classes
based on their differential effects on receptor structure and in
the manner by which these differently conformed receptors are
recognized within cells. This important finding predicts that,
notwithstanding non–mechanism-related activities, the currently
available steroidal antiestrogens will exhibit cross-resistance in
breast tumors (48), but that the benzothiophene-derived SERD,
GW5638, is sufficiently unique as to expect that it can be used
in patients that are resistant to molecules like ICI182,780, as

has been previously shown in tumors resistant to tamoxifen
(24, 45).
