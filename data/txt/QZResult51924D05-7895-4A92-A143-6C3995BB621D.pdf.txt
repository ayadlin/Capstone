Abstract
The ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) chimeric tyrosine kinase, a potent
oncoprotein expressed in tumors derived from multiple cell
lineages, functions as a constitutively active protein-tyrosine
kinase. ETV6-NTRK expression leads to the constitutive
activation of two major effector pathways of wild-type NTRK3,
namely, the Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
mitogenic pathway and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)Akt pathway mediating cell survival, and both are required
for EN transformation. However, it remains unclear how
ETV6-NTRK3 activates Ras-Erk1/2 and/or PI3K-Akt cascades.
Here, we define some aspects of the molecular mechanisms
regulating ETV6-NTRK–dependent Ras-Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt
activation. We show that ETV6-NTRK3 associates with c-Src,
and that treatment with SU6656, a c-Src inhibitor, completely
blocks ETV6-NTRK-transforming activity. Treatment of
NIH3T3 cells expressing ETV6-NTRK3 with SU6656 attenuated
the activation of Ras-Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt. Suppression of
c-Src by RNA interference in NIH3T3-ETV6-NTRK3 cells
resulted in markedly decreased expression of cyclin D1 and
suppression of activation of Ras-Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt.
However, in Src-deficient cells, the ETV6-NTRK3 failed to
activate the PI3K-Atk pathway, but not the Ras-Erk1/2
pathway. Therefore, these data indicate that ETV6-NTRK3
induces the PI3K-Akt cascade through the activation of c-Src.

Introduction
ETV6-NTRK3 chimeric transcripts encode the helix-loop-helix or
pointed domain of ETV6 fused to the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)
domain of NTRK3 (1, 2). ETV6 (also known as TEL) is an ETS
family transcription factor thought to play a major role in early
hematopoiesis and angiogenesis (3–5). The ETV6 gene has also
been identified as a fusion partner in leukemia-associated chimeric
proteins, such as ETV6-PDGFR (6), ETV6-AML1 (7, 8), ETV6-JAK2
(9), ETV6-ARG (10, 11), and others (12–14). Moreover, an ETV6NTRK3 variant fusion lacking ETV6 exon 5 has been reported in a
case of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) occurring in an adult
patient (15). The NTRK3 gene (also known as TRKC) encodes the

transmembrane surface receptor for neurotrophin-3 involved in
growth, development, and cell survival in the central nervous
system (reviewed in ref. 16). Other reports highlight potential roles
for NTRK receptors in oncogenesis. ETV6-NTRK3 functions as a
chimeric PTK with potent transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells
(17). In addition, the ETV6-NTRK3 protein associated with AML
induced a rapidly fatal myeloproliferative disease in a murine bone
marrow transplant model system (18). Therefore, ETV6-NTRK3
seems to have oncogenic activity in both mesenchymal and
hematologic cells.
The mechanism of ETV6-NTRK3–mediated oncogenesis is not
well characterized. ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) is capable of homodimerization or heterodimerization with endogenous ETV6 via the helixloop-helix domain, leading to constitutive NTRK3 signaling.
However, ETV6-NTRK3 fails to interact with adapter molecules
known to associate with wild-type NTRK3 (17, 18). These include Src
homology and collagen and growth factor receptor binding protein
2 (Grb2), which link NTRK3 to the Ras-Erk1/2 mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) pathway involved in mitogenesis or
differentiation (16, 19) or the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K) linking NTRK3 with the PI3K-Akt neuronal survival
pathway (16, 19, 20). ETV6-NTRK3 does bind peritoneal lymphocytes, another known NTRK3 interactor that activates protein kinase
C, but PTK-active mutants unable to bind phospholipase C (PLC)
did not show defects in the transformation activity (17). We have
recently shown that the distal COOH-terminal sequence of EN
interacts specifically with the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)
domain of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and that this
interaction is essential for EN transformation (21). However, it
remains to be determined whether the interaction with the
downstream signaling cascades is direct through IRS-1 or indirect
via other molecules.
Expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein is associated with
constitutively high levels of phosphorylated Mek1 and Akt, even
in the absence of serum. Moreover, ETV6-NTRK3–expressing cells
show serum-independent elevation of cyclin D1 protein. Inhibition
of either the Ras-Erk1/2 MAP kinase or the PI3K-Akt pathway alone
completely blocks colony formation of ETV6-NTRK3–expressing
cells in soft agar assays. Furthermore, the constitutive expression
of cyclin D1 protein in ETV6-NTRK3–expressing cells can be
transiently down-regulated by MEK1 or PI3K inhibition. However,
only the inhibition of the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway led to persistent
down-regulation of cyclin D1 levels in cells expressing ETV6NTRK3 (15).
c-Src is known to activate PI3K-Akt and the MAP/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK cascades through
both focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent and FAK-independent

c-Src Mediates ETV6-NTRK3–Induced PI3K-Akt Pathway

pathways (22). c-Src has also been implicated in nerve growth
factor–induced down-regulation of epidermal growth factor
receptors in PC12 cells. Expression of dominant-negative c-Src
blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPKs (23). These results
prompted us to examine whether ETV6-NTRK3 activates MEK/ERK
and/or PI3K-Akt through the activation of c-Src. Here, we show
that EN binds to and activates c-Src, and inhibition of c-Src activation blocks EN-transforming activity and activation of PI3K-Akt.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and antibodies and reagent. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF) deficient in c-Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF) were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and c-Src (SYF cells
deficient for Yes and Fyn but overexpressing c-Src) cells were obtained from
the ATCC. NIH3T3, 293T, SYF cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). Expression of Src was frequently assessed by
Western blot analysis. Antibodies were obtained from the following
companies: Anti–c-Src, anti-TrkC (H-300), anti-HA(Y-11), anti–cyclin D1
and anti-Myc (9E10) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antiV5 from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); anti–phospho-Src, anti–phospho-MEK1/
2, and anti–phospho-Akt from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA);
anti–h-actin from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Pharmacologic inhibition
was done with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (20 Amol/L) and c-Src family
tyrosine kinases inhibitor SU6656, both from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
Plasmids. Three small interfering RNA–coding oligos against mouse
c-Src were designed and verified to be specific to c-Src by Blast search
against the mouse genome. To construct hairpin-type single RNAi vectors,
5 AL (100 mmol/L) of the synthesized sense and antisense oligonucleotides
(Table 1) were combined with 1 AL of 1 mol/L NaCl and annealed by
incubation at 95jC for 2 min, followed by rapid cooling to 72jC, and ramp
cooling to 4jC over a period of 2 h. The c-Src–siRNA-1 and c-Src–siRNA-2
insert were subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI sites of the pFG12 lentivirus
vector. A control siRNA, which does not match any known mouse coding
cDNA, was used as control.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. 293T cells were used for
the detection of protein-protein interaction in vivo. 293T cells were
transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. After a 24-h transfection,
cells were switched to 0.2% serum overnight. Cells were lysed in a buffer
containing 25 mmol/L HEPES (pH, 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,
10% glycerol, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete,
Roche, Gipf-Oberfrick, Switzerland). Extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE,
followed by electrotransfer to poly(vinylidene diflouride) membranes and
probed with polyclonal or monoclonal antisera, followed by horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG),
respectively, and visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For immunoprecipitation, the
cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 1 h, followed
by incubation with g-bind beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.,
Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h at 4jC. Beads were washed four times with the buffer
used for cell solubilization. Immune complexes were then eluted by boiling
for 3 min in 2 Laemmli buffer (pH, 6.8), and then extracts were analyzed
by immunoblotting as described above.
Soft agar assays. Soft agar assays were done according to established
protocols (24). NIH3T3 cells infected with recombinant retroviruses
carrying either the empty vector, ETV6-NTRK3, or NIH3T3-EN cells
carrying siRNA-coding oligos against mouse c-Src were seeded in triplicate
at a concentration of 8  103 cells per well in a six-well plate. Bottom layers
were made up of 0.4% agar in 9% FBS and DMEM. Cells were resuspended
in a top layer of 0.2% agar in 9% FBS and DMEM. Cells were fed every other
day by placing two drops of medium on the top layer. After 3 weeks at 37jC,
colonies were then stained with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (1 mg/mL
stock diluted at 1:500) for 16 h, and macroscopic colonies were counted
(in quadruplicate). Each determination was done in triplicate.
Anchorage-independent cell growth. NIH3T3 cells expressing MSCV,
ETV6-NTRK3, and si-c-Src were seeded into a Ultra Low Cluster plate (ULC

www.aacrjournals.org

plate; Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA) at 1  106 cells and photographed
at 96 h.
Viral production and infection of target cells. 293T cells were
transfected with the transfer vector plasmid pCAG (empty) or pCAG-ETV6NTRK3 plasmid with the envelope-encoding plasmid pHCMVG, the
packaging plasmid pMDLg/pRRE, and the Rev-expression plasmid pRSVRev by using the calcium phosphate method. The supernatants were
harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection, pooled, passed through a 0.45-Am
filter, ultracentrifuged for 2 h at 100,000  g in a SW28 rotor, resuspended
in 100 AL of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and the lentiviral stocks
were stored in a small aliquot at 80jC for titration and cell infection. SYF
and SYF-Src cells were plated in six-well plates (1  105 cells per well) and
were cultured overnight. Lentiviruses were diluted in 2 mL DMEM
containing polybrene (8 g/mL) and then centrifuged for 30 min at 1,500
rpm and after 24 h infection, polybrene-DMEM was replaced with fresh
DMEM medium, and the cells were cultured for other assays.

Results
EN directly binds to c-Src. We examined the possibility that EN
may interact directly with c-Src in vivo. We used V5-tagged EN to
screen for potential interactions between EN and Src. 293T cells
were transfected with HA-tagged Src and V5-tagged EN. Total cell
extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA
or anti-V5 antibody, followed by immunoblotting using anti-HA or
anti-V5 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, EN interacted strongly
with c-Src. We next determined whether endogenous Src interacts
with EN. To this end, we did immunoprecipitation experiments in
NIH3T3 cells, which were infected with recombinant retroviruses
carrying either ETV6-NTRK3 cDNA or the empty MSCVpac vector
as a negative control. Endogenous c-Src was able to interact with
EN (Fig. 1B). The kinase dead EN-K380N mutant, which fails to
autophosphorylate and completely lacks transformation activity
(17), as well as a mutant in which all three tyrosines were converted
to phenylalanine (EN-Yx3F), failed to interact with c-Src (Fig. 1B).
We also examined the effect of K252a 43, an inhibitor of the Trk
tyrosine kinases, to determine whether NTRK3 kinase activity of
EN is required for its ability to interact with c-Src. As shown in
Fig. 1C, pretreatment with K252a markedly reduced levels of c-Src
bound to EN in NIH3T3 cells expressing EN. This indicates that
NTRK3 (TrkC) kinase activity is required for the interaction
between c-Src and EN. To further investigate whether interaction of
EN with c-Src results in the activation of c-Src kinase, we examined
the phosphorylation of c-Src in lysates of NIH3T3 cells expressing
EN as well as EN-K380N and EN-Yx3F. EN expression increased
phosphorylation of c-Src–Tyr416. However, c-Src phosphorylation
was not observed in NIH3T3 cells expressing EN-K380N and
EN-Yx3F (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that phosphorylation of
EN kinase may result in a conformational change, exposing its
interaction domain to c-Src.

anti-HA antibody or anti-V5 antibody and g-bind beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences), followed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody or anti-HA antibody.
The expression of EN and c-Src was monitored as indicated. B, schematic representation of ETV6-NTRK3 mutant constructs (top ). c-Src does not associate with the
kinase-dead EN-K380N and EN-Yx3F mutant protein. NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing EN, EN-K380N, and EN-Y3XF as well as control NIH3T3 cells (MSCV)
were used. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-TrkC (NTRK3) antibody and g-bind beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences), followed by
immunoblotting with anti-Src antibody. C, NTRK3 kinase activity is required for the EN interaction with c-Src. EN-expressing NIH3T3 cells or vector control cells
were pretreated with K-252a for 2 h. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-TrkC (NTRK3) antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Src antibody. D, EN
increased phosphorylation of c-Src in vivo. E, identification of EN–c-Src complexes in human primary tumors. Primary tumor tissue extracts from EN-positive CMN
and CFS were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti–cSrc antibody or IgG as a control, followed by immunoblotting with anti-TrkC (NTRK3) antibody.
Whole-tissue lysates from primary tumors also were probed for EN, c-Src, phospho–c-Src, and h-actin as a loading control.

Identification of EN-Src complexes in human primary
tumors. We next wished to confirm that the above findings are
relevant to human tumors expressing EN. We therefore screened
for the presence of EN-v-Src complexes in human primary tumors
positive for the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. These included four
cellular mesoblastic nephromas (CMN) occurring in 5-month- and
5-week-old infants and one congenital fibrosarcoma (CFS) occurring in a 15-month-old infant (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Tumors were diagnosed using standard histopathologic criteria.
All cases were screened for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcripts using
established methods (1), but only the CMN and CFS cases were
fusion positive (data not shown). We screened 12 primary tumor
samples (4 CFSs and 8 CMN), but only 5 samples were of sufficient
integrity for protein studies. Therefore, we examined the interaction between c-Src and EN using these five samples. Total tissue
extracts were isolated from primary tumors and subjected to
immunoprecipitation with the anti–c-Src antibody, followed by
immunoblotting with the anti-TrkC antibody. As shown in Fig. 1F
and G, EN–c-Src complexes were found in the CMN and CFS cases,
but not in control liver samples. EN expression was associated
with a strong increase in phosphorylation of c-Src and Akt (S473;
Fig. 1F). These results clearly show that the interaction between
EN and c-Src occurs in vivo in human primary cancer tissues
expressing ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusions.

SU6656 treatment suppresses EN transformation activity.
Cells infected with ETV6-NTRK3 exhibited a dramatically transformed phenotype compared with negative control cells. We
examined the effect of SU6656 (25), an inhibitor of c-Src kinase,
on EN transformation activity by assessing the cell morphology.
EN transformation activity was almost completely abrogated by
the addition of SU6656 (Fig. 2A). Treatment of NIH3T3 cells
expressing EN with even 1 Amol/L SU6656 exhibited a normal
phenotype and failed to form microscopic or macroscopic
colonies in soft agar when scored after 28 days (Fig. 2A and B).
Most tumor cell lines suppress anoikis and form multicellular
spheroids through cell-cell adhesion when grown in nonadhesive
agar-coated dishes. Under these conditions, nonmalignant cells
generally fail to do so and undergo massive cell death in culture
(26). We observed that when placed in nonadherent cultures,
parental NIH3T3 cells poorly formed cell aggregates and existed
as dead or dying cells under these conditions (Fig. 2C). In
contrast, EN-expressing cells readily form multicellular spheroids
within 6 to 24 h that are stable indefinitely in culture (27).
However, SU6656 treatment of EN-expressing cells suppressed
formation of multicellular spheroids (Fig. 2C). The fact that
NIH3T3-EN cells do not form stable spheroids in the presence of
SU6656 indicates that this reagent is blocking the ability of cells to
suppress anoikis.

c-Src Mediates ETV6-NTRK3–Induced PI3K-Akt Pathway

Characterization of the c-Src/EN interaction. c-Src is a
multidomain protein containing a unique NH2-terminal domain:
UD (residues 1–80), SH3 (residues 83–144), SH2 protein interaction
domains (150–247), a catalytic region (269–522), and a negativeregulatory tyrosine located near the COOH terminus (residue 523;
ref. 28; Fig. 3A). To identify the functional domain of c-Src
responsible for the interaction with EN, we used a series of deletion
constructs. The c-Src mutant lacking the UD region, SH3 and SH2
still interacted with EN (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the c-Src
COOH-terminal region is directly involved in this interaction. Next,
we tested the interaction of EN with a series of COOH-terminal
deletion mutants. The c-Src DC, which does not have a negative
regulatory tyrosine in the COOH-terminal region, still interacted
with EN. Although the deletion of amino acid residues 361–535
(DKD-1 and DKD-2) also interacted with EN, the deletion of amino
acid residues 275–360 abrogated the EN interaction (Fig. 3C).
These results clearly indicate that the region including amino acids
275–360 of Src, which includes the ATP binding domain, is required
for EN interaction.
The Fyn tyrosine kinase, a member of the c-Src kinase family, is
known to associate with IRS-1 in vitro and in vivo (29). Because
other members of the c-Src kinase family have similar SH2
domains, these kinases may also associate with IRS-1 and
contribute to the overall response in various cellular backgrounds.
Because IRS-1 functions as the adaptor protein linking EN to
downstream signaling pathways, we examined whether the
interaction between EN and c-Src is mediated through IRS-1.
293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged c-Src and HA-tagged
IRS-1 with or without the V5-tagged EN. IRS-1 interacts with either
EN or c-Src (Fig. 4A and B). To determine whether c-Src could

associate with EN directly, 293T cells were transiently transfected
with HA-tagged c-Src and either the V5-tagged EN construct or
V5-tagged EN-D614 construct which fails to associate with IRS-1
(21). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies
followed by Western blot analysis with V5 antibodies. As shown
in Fig. 4C, EN and EN-D614 were pulled down in c-Src lysates.
Equal expression of c-Src was confirmed by Western blotting of
lysates using HA antibodies (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that c-Src
directly interacts with EN.
c-Src expression in c-Src–deficient MEF cells enhances the
EN-IRS-1 complex formation. To test whether EN binding to
IRS-1 requires c-Src, we used SYF cells that were derived from Src,
Yes, and Fyn triple knock-out mouse embryos (30). Because
Src, Yes, and Fyn are three ubiquitously expressed members of the
Src family tyrosine kinases, no Src family tyrosine kinase activity
was detected in these SYF cells (30). We infected SYF and SYF–c-Src
cells with the lentiviral vector transducing the ETV6-NTRK3 gene.
As shown in Fig. 4D, expression of EN protein in these cells was
verified by immunoblotting using the anti-TrkC (C-14) antibody.
We next determined whether EN–IRS-1 complex formation is
increased in the presence of c-Src. IRS-1 immunoprecipitated with
EN was detected in c-Src–deficient SYF cells. However, the level of
IRS-1 immunoprecipitated with EN was markedly enhanced in SYF
cells expressing c-Src compared with that in SYF cells (Fig. 4E).
Interestingly, expression of EN markedly decreased the level of
IRS-1 protein in SYF cells. In SYF–c-Src cells, the level of IRS-1 is
much lower than that in SYF cells, and expression of EN further
reduced the level of IRS-1. It is possible that when cells are
transformed by an oncoprotein such as EN, IRS-1 cellular levels
must remain below a certain threshold to avoid inducing apoptosis

in these cells. However, this hypothesis requires further experiments to validate. We next examined whether endogenous c-Src
plays a critical role for EN and IRS-1 interaction and EN-mediated
IRS-1 phosphorylation. To do this, the RNA interference approach
was employed to knockdown endogenous c-Src in NIH3T3 cells
expressing EN. We constructed lentiviral vectors expressing two
different c-Src siRNAs (Si–c-Src 1 and 2). To establish cell lines
expressing these c-Src siRNA genes, two cycles of infection and
selection were done. The c-Src gene silencing activity of c-Src RNAi
in NIH3T3 cells expressing EN was confirmed by immunoblotting
with c-Src antibodies. Expression of c-Src siRNAs (Si–c-Src 1 and 2)
resulted in more than 80% decreases in the expression of the
endogenous c-Src (Supplementary Fig. S2). The luciferase RNAi
nucleotide (Si-Lu) was used as a control. We examined whether the
EN and IRS-1 interaction and EN-mediated IRS-1 phosphorylation
are affected when endogenous c-Src is silenced in NIH3T3-EN cells.
The level of IRS-1 bound to EN was markedly reduced in c-Src–
silenced NIH3T3-EN cells (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, EN-mediated
IRS-1 phosphorylation seemed to be increased in c-Src–silenced
NIH3T3-EN cells. However, when IRS-1 phosphorylation levels are
normalized with endogenous IRS-1 levels, this induction effect is
negligible (data not shown). We are currently investigating how
c-Src reduces expression of IRS-1. Taken together, these results
suggest that c-Src facilitates the EN–IRS-1 interaction. However,
these data do not exclude the possibility that EN interacts directly,
although more weakly, with IRS-1, or that an unidentified protein
may also be involved in the EN–IRS-1 complex formation.
Treatment with SU6656 attenuates Akt Activation in ENexpressing NIH3T3 cells. ETV6-NTRK3 seems to be linking to
both the Ras-Erk1/2 and the PI3K-Akt pathways via adaptors
other than those used by wild-type NTRK3 (15). Recently, we
have shown a role for IRS-1 binding in constitutive activation of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways in EN-transformed cells.
Therefore, we examined whether c-Src also plays a role in ENinduced activation of the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways and
in constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 by using an inhibitor
of c-Src kinase. To assess this, we examined the activation states
of MEK1/2 and Akt, as well as cyclin D1 levels, in NIH3T3 cells
expressing EN by treating these cells with SU6656. Levels of
phosphorylated (activated) MEK1/2 and Akt as well as cyclin D1
were reduced markedly in EN-expressing cells after treatment
with SU6656 (Fig. 5A). Previous studies have shown that the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks soft agar colony formation of
EN-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts (27). To determine that PI3KAkt is a downstream effector of the c-Src kinase, we treated
EN-expressing NIH3T3 cell lines with the PI3K-Akt inhibitor
LY294002 and examined the phosphorylation of Src. LY294002
treatment caused a reduction in phosphorylation of Akt, whereas
it has no effect on c-Src phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), indicating
that PI3K-Akt acts downstream of c-Src in EN-expressing
NIH3T3 cell lines. Taken together, our findings show that c-Src
is essential for the ability of EN to constitutively activate the
Ras-MAPK and the PI3K-Akt pathways and to induce cyclin D1
overexpression.
Effects of c-Src–targeted siRNA on EN-transforming activity.
To further prove the requirement of c-Src for EN transformation
activity, we examined the EN-induced MEK1/2 and Akt-1 activation, cyclin D1 expression, and the EN transformation activity in
c-Src–silenced NIH3T3-EN cells and control NIH3T3-EN cells
(si-Luc). As shown in Fig. 5C, EN-induced MEK1/2 and Akt-1
activation and cyclin D1 expression were significantly reduced
in c-Src knockdown cells. Expression of c-Src RNAi nucleotides
(Si–c-Src) failed to form microscopic or macroscopic colonies in

c-Src Mediates ETV6-NTRK3–Induced PI3K-Akt Pathway

EN (Fig. 5D). Taken together, our data suggest that c-Src plays
a role in the EN-induced MEK1/2 and Akt-1 activation and cyclin
D1 expression and mediates the EN transformation activity.
c-Src is required for EN-induced Akt activation in c-Src–
deficient MEF cells. To genetically test the role of c-Src in EN
signaling to the MEK1/2 and PI3K–Akt-1 pathways, we investigated
the activation of MEK1/2 and PI3K–Akt-1 by the EN in SYF and
SYF–c-Src cells. SYF cells and SYF-Src cells with or without the
EN were serum starved overnight and then incubated with serum.
Ras-Erk1/2 and PI3K–Akt-1 activation as well as cyclin D1
expression were not observed in SYF cells. Constitutive serumindependent phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 was observed in SYF
cells expressing c-Src, but EN expression in these cells markedly
increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, stable
expression of EN in SYF cells did not lead to increased activity of
Akt, suggesting that EN-induced PI3K-Akt activation requires c-Src
(Fig. 6B). In both SYF and SFY-c-Src cells, expression of EN
increased the Mek1 phosphorylation even in the absence of serum
(Fig. 6B). Interestingly, SYF-Src cells had constitutively high levels
of Mek1 phosphoryation, but addition of serum decreased levels of

Mek1 phosphoryation. SYF cells expressing EN exhibited constitutively high levels of cyclin D1 even after overnight serum starvation
(Fig. 6A). SYF-Src cells responded to EN in cyclin D1 elevation only
in the presence of serum (Fig. 6B). In NIH3T3-EN cells, silencing
c-Src expression blocked EN-mediated MEK phosphorylation
(Fig. 5C). In contrast, EN-mediated MEK phosphorylation remained
unaffected in SYF cells. Because SYF cells are also deficient of
Yes and Fyn in addition to c-Src, Yes and Fyn may also affect
EN-mediated MEK phosphorylation via unknown mechanisms. It is
also possible that in the absence of the three Src family members,
the cells use another mechanism to induce Ras-MAPK and MEK
activation.
Previous studies have shown that the Mek1 inhibitor U0126
markedly decreased levels of cyclin D1 levels in EN-expressing
cells. We also confirmed this finding in SYF and SRF–c-Src cells
expressing EN (Fig. 6C and D). These genetic data showed that
c-Src is required for EN-induced PI3K-Akt activation, but not for
the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway. These results further supported by our
previous finding that only the inhibition of the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway
led to persistent down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression (15).

Discussion
The EN chimeric product functions as a constitutively active
protein-tyrosine kinase with potent transforming activity in
multiple cell lineages (15, 17). Activation of the EN protein-tyrosine
kinase is linked to the induction of downstream signaling pathways
of wild-type NTRK3, including Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt, leading
to elevated cyclin D1 expression and aberrant cell cycle progression (15). However, the mechanism of EN-mediated oncogenesis
remains for the most part unknown. In this study, we show that
c-Src activation is necessary for the transformation activity of EN
in NIH3T3 cells. Inhibition of either c-Src kinase activity or c-Src
expression blocked anchorage-independent growth and formation
of microscopic or macroscopic colonies in soft agar in NIH3T3
fibroblasts expressing EN.
The transforming properties of EN are associated with the
constitutive activation of NTRK3 signaling pathways, namely, the
Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt cascades (15). However, other than IRS-1
(ref. 27; see below), the adaptor proteins that link EN to activation
of these pathways have yet to be identified. EN does not directly
associate with known NTRK3-associating molecules, including
Src homology and collagen, Grb2, PI3K p85, ABL, SH2B, or Ship2
(15, 17). The unique ability of ETV6-NTRK3 to activate both the
Ras-Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways may be key to its oncogenic
activity. An association between the aberrant activation of the RasErk1/2 pathway and cellular transformation is well described in the
literature (31, 32). Alterations in the PI3K-Akt pathway have also

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

been observed in humans tumors, including the amplification
of the Akt h isoform in breast and ovarian carcinomas (33),
amplification of the PI3K regulatory subunit in ovarian carcinoma
(34), and mutations of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene leading to
the constitutive Akt activation (reviewed in ref. 35). Although these
and other studies (reviewed in ref. 36) illustrate the oncogenic
potential of each individual pathway, it is becoming increasingly
clear that a synergistic effect exists between Ras-Erk1/2 and PI3KAkt cascades in transformation. Activated Ras mutants that are
incapable of activating PI3K are unable to transform NIH3T3 cells
unless an activated (nontransforming) viral form of Akt is
coexpressed (37). Moreover, the transformation of rat intestinal
epithelial cells by oncogenic Ha-Ras not only leads to coactivation
of PI3K-Akt but is blocked by PI3K inhibitors (38). Recent studies
suggest that depletion of endogenous c-Src levels by means of siRNA
or expression of dominant-negative c-Src significantly reduced
cell proliferation in vitro and led to a clear decrease in Akt phosphorylation, placing c-Src upstream of the PI3K-Akt signals. Therefore, our data indicate that EN-activated c-Src tyrosine kinase
exerts its transforming activity by activating PI3K-Akt.
Recent studies show that EN binds the IRS-1 protein, and that
EN–IRS-1 complex localization to the membrane leads to the activation of the PI3K-Akt cascade (27). Expression of EN in insulin-like
growth factor-IR (IGF-IR)–null R mouse embryo fibroblasts is
specifically associated with a defect in Akt activation, whereas
these cells retain intact Ras-MAPK pathway activation and cell

cycle progression. R EN cells undergo detachment-induced
apoptosis (anoikis) under anchorage-independent conditions. This
report showed that soft agar colony formation, spheroid formation,
and tumorigenesis induced by EN require Akt activation, and IGFIR–mediated IRS-1 membrane localization is essential for Akt
activation during EN transformation. We found that either
inhibition of c-Src kinase activity or knockdown of c-Src expression
in NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing EN suppresses Akt activation.
These results suggest that c-Src is involved in the EN–IRS-1–
induced Akt activation. One possibility to explain our findings is
that c-Src is also recruited to EN–IRS-1 complexes and is essential
to link these complexes to downstream signaling cascades such
as PI3K-Akt and Ras-Erk1/2. IGF-I and IGF-II are known to promote direct association of c-Src with IGF-IR and to phosphorylate
c-Src (39) and PP2, a specific c-Src–like kinase inhibitor, blocks
IGF-I–stimulated Akt activation (39). Interestingly, IGF-IR expression was reported to be up-regulated in the PANC-1 human
pancreatic cancer cell line when cells were stably transfected with
active c-Src (40). This increased expression of IGF-IR may also
enhance the Akt activation. IGF-IR is frequently overexpressed in
several types of human malignancy and is associated with invasion
and metastasis of tumor cells. It will be interesting to investigate
whether IGF-IR is also overexpressed in EN-expressing tumors.

Interestingly, we recently showed that Ras-ERK pathway signaling, cyclin D1 induction, and cell cycle progression may be
independent of EN/IRS-1 complex localization to the plasma membrane (27). Whereas PI3K-Akt signaling occurs almost exclusively
at the plasma membrane, Ras-ERK signaling can take place on
Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membranes (41). EN showed a
perinuclear expression pattern in IGF-IR null R cells, which is
indicative of localization to internal membranes. It is therefore
possible that Ras-ERK signaling is activated predominantly on
endomembranes in EN-expressing cells (27). Taken together, our
observations establish an essential role for c-Src kinase in the
activation of the PI3K-Akt cascade in EN-expressing fibroblasts.
c-Src is a proto-oncogene belonging to the nonreceptor protein
tyrosine kinase family, which plays a prominent role in carcinogenesis (42, 43). c-Src kinase activity is significantly increased in
a number of human cancers, including lung, skin, colon, breast,
ovarian, endometrial, and head and neck malignancies, and this
elevated c-Src activity is correlated with poor metastasis-free
survival (42, 44, 45). Because c-Src is a critical component of so
many different processes that promote cancer progression, it is
becoming recognized as a valid chemotherapeutic target. c-Src and
its family members are critical mediators of multiple signaling
pathways that regulate all stages of cancer progression ( from

forms of Mek1/2 (Ser217/221), phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), cyclin D1, and h-actin (as a loading control). C and D, the inhibitor U0126 reduces cyclin D1 levels in

serum–DMEM F U0126 (10 mmol/L) for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared, and immunoblotting was done using a cyclin D1 antibody. Equal loading was
determined by probing the blots with an antibody against h-actin.

initiation to metastasis) in multiple cell types, and thus, one can
envision the use of c-Src inhibitors in a wide range of malignancies
at all stages of disease. Recent studies provided compelling evidence that in vivo pharmacologic treatment with a c-Src inhibitor
could be very promising for the treatment of human cancers
and their metastatic complications (46, 47). Interestingly, human
primary cellular tumors expressing the ETV6-NTRK3 gene exhibit
elevated c-Src protein levels and catalytic activity. Given the
difficulty in the clinical management of CFS and cellular CMN,
the possibility that c-Src inhibitors can be used alone or in
combination for the treatment of human tumors expressing ETV6NTRK3 is of great interest.
In summary, we have shown that EN binds to and activates c-Src,
and inhibition of c-Src activation blocks EN transforming activity

and activation of PI3K-Akt. In c-Src–deficient SYF cells, it seems
that there is no Akt activation in response to serum, and that
expression of EN cannot overcome this. Because a recent report
showed that c-Src is directly associated with Akt (48), our data
suggest that EN requires c-Src to activate Akt.
