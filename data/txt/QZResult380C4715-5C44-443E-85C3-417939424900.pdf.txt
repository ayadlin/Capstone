ABSTRACT
Nrf2 is a key transcription factor for genes coding for antioxidants, detoxification
enzymes, and multiple drug resistance and it also confers resistance to anticancer
drugs. Here, we hypothesized that mutant p53 could upregulate Nrf2 expression at
the transcriptional level, thereby conferring cisplatin resistance in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Luciferase reporter assays and real-time PCR analysis indicated
that the Nrf2 promoter activity and its mRNA levels were markedly suppressed
by wild-type p53, but not by mutant p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
further confirmed that wild-type p53 binds at the p53 putative binding site to block
Sp1 binding to the Nrf2 promoter and consequently to suppress the Nrf2 promoter
activity. The MTT assay indicated that an increase in Nrf2 expression by mutant p53
is responsible for cisplatin resistance. Among the Nrf2 downstream genes, Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL contribute more strongly to Nrf2-mediated cisplatin resistance when compared
with heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Cox regression analysis showed that patients with
high-Nrf2, high-Bcl-2, high-Bcl-xL mRNA tumors were more commonly occurred
unfavorable response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy than their counterparts. The
prognostic significance of Nrf2 mRNA levels on OS and RFS was also observed in
patients who have received cisplatin-based chemotherapy, particularly in p53-mutant
patients. Collectively, mutant p53 may confer cisplatin resistance via upregulation of
Nrf2 expression, and Nrf2 mRNA level may predict chemotherapeutic response and
outcomes in NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

lung cancer therapy [2]. Therefore, mechanistic studies
to uncover the possible pathway(s) involved in drug
resistance are essential for improving the outcomes and
life quality in patients with this disease.
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is still considered
the first-line therapeutic strategy for lung cancer [3, 4].
Cisplatin induces cancer cell death via induction of
double strand DNA breaks caused by the generation of

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
around the world. Late diagnosis and low response
to therapeutic drugs are viewed as the causes of poor
patient outcomes [1]. The five-year survival rate has
remained at about 15% for the past three decades despite
the development and use of several targeting drugs for

reactive oxygen species (ROS) [5, 6]. Gene expression of
antioxidants that eliminate ROS is promoted by an NF-E2related factor 2 (Nrf2), which binds to antioxidant response
elements (ARE) of the promoters of these genes [7-11].
Activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling has been demonstrated
through mutations of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
1 (Keap1) or Nrf2 to protect Nrf2 from degradation by
Keap1 [12-17]. The Keap1/Nrf2 mutations in NSCLC
patients were ranged from 3.2% to 60% and this variation
may be due to the number of study subjects and histologic
subtypes. In fact, the Keap1/Nrf2 mutation was frequently
reported to be uncommon in NSCLC patients including
Taiwanese ( < 3%); (Supplementary Table 1). High
Nrf2 expression has been shown to promote resistance
to different anticancer drugs in human cancers [18-22].
However, the underlying mechanism of an increase in
Nrf2 expression is not fully understood although some
mechanisms have been reported [23, 24]. For example,
high Nrf2 expression driven by NF-κB signaling confers
chemoresistance in human myeloid leukemia [23]. Mutant
k-ras confers chemoresistance by upregulating Nrf2
transcription through a TPA response element [24].
The cross-talk between Nrf2 and p53 plays a crucial
role in cellular homeostasis. Positive or negative coregulation at the post-translational level has been reported
between Nrf2 and p53 [25]. For example, binding of the
p53 downstream p21 to Nrf2 inhibits Nrf2 degradation
[26], whereas binding of the Nrf2 downstream NAD(P)
H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) to p53 prevents
p53 degradation [27]. However, Nrf2 promotes MDM2
expression for degradation of p53 protein [28]. P53
inhibits Nrf2 downstream expression of genes, such
as NQO1 and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) by directly
interacting with ARE-containing promoters [29].
Therefore, we expected that the reciprocal regulation
between Nrf2 and p53 may modulate cancer cell apoptosis
induced by chemotherapeutic agents.
Our preliminary data from lung cancer patients
showed that Nrf2 mRNA expression levels were higher
in p53-mutant tumors than in p53-wild-type tumors. A
software analysis revealed that putative binding sites for
Sp1 and p53 could exist on the Nrf2 promoter (-1036/+1).
We therefore hypothesized that mutant p53 might directly
upregulate Nrf2 transcription to confer resistance of
chemotherapeutic agents and consequently result in poor
outcome in NSCLC patients.

the transcription level by p53 status. The Nrf2/ARE
downstream genes HO-1 and NQO1 expression were
relatively lower in p53-wild-type cells than in p53-mutant
cells (Figure 1A upper panel). Concomitantly, Nrf2 protein
and its mRNA expression levels were significantly lower
in p53-wild-type cells than in p53-mutant cells (Figure
1A). These results suggest that Nrf2 expression might be
suppressed by wild-type p53, but not by mutant p53 at
transcriptional level.
A software analyses predicted two p53 and four
Sp1 putative binding sites located on the -1036/-1 Nrf2
promoter (http://www.genome.jp/tools/motif/). Three
Nrf2 promoters (-1036/+1, -740/+1, and -229/+1)
were constructed by PCR and deletion mutations for
luciferase reporter assay (Figure 1B upper panel). These
three Nrf2 promoters were respectively transfected into
H1299, H1975, and CL3 cells. The reporter activity was
significantly higher for the -1036/+1 Nrf2 promoter than
for the other two Nrf2 promoters (-740/+1 and -229/+1)
in these cells. These results revealed the possibility
that p53 and Sp1 putative binding sites located near the
transcriptional start site might play an important role in
Nrf2 transcription in these three cell types.
The possibility that wild-type p53 could suppress
Nrf2 promoter activity was explored using p53-null
H1299 cells by transfection with wild-type p53 or
different mutant p53 expression vectors including H179Y,
L194R, S240R, R249S, A276D, and E286Q. Western
blotting showed that p53 expression was detected in
H1299 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant p53
expression vectors, but was not observed in H1299 cells
with an empty vector transfection (VC) (Figure 1C upper
panel). Nrf2 expression was almost completely suppressed
by wild-type p53 expression vector, but was unchanged
by mutant p53 expression vector transfections in H1299
cells. The luciferase reporter assay indicated a marked
decrease in Nrf2 promoter activity following wild-type
p53 expression vector transfection, but showed unchanged
or relatively increased Nrf2 promoter activity following
transfection with mutant p53 expression vectors when
compared with the activity in VC cells (Figure 1C lower
panel). These results suggest that Nrf2 expression in lung
cancer cells is suppressed by wild-type p53, but not by
mutant p53 at the transcriptional level.

Nrf2 transcription is down-regulated by wild-type
p53, but not by mutant p53 via decreased Sp1

RESULTS

We next examined the possibility that wild-type p53
could interact with Sp1 to suppress Nrf2 transcription.
The p53-null H1299 cells were transfected with two
doses of wild-type p53 or mutant p53 expression vectors

Nrf2 expression was almost completely suppressed by a
high dose of wild-type p53 transfection, but was nearly
unchanged by mutant p53 expression vector transfections
in H1299 cells (Figure 2A upper panel). The luciferase
reporter assay and real-time PCR analysis revealed a
dose-dependent decrease in Nrf2 promoter activity and its
mRNA levels in response to wild-type p53 transfection
in H1299 cells. However, Nrf2 promoter activity and
its mRNA level were nearly unchanged in H1299 cells

transfected with H179Y or L194R expression vector,
whereas Nrf2 promoter activity was elevated by high
transfection doses of L194R expression vector (Figure
2A middle panel). ChIP assay showed that wild-type p53
was indeed bound, but the binding of mutant p53 was not
revealed on the p53 binding site of Nrf2 promoter. The
binding of Sp1 to the Nrf2 promoter in H1299 cells with
wild-type p53 transfection almost completely eliminated
when compared with VC and H1299 cells transfected
with mutant p53 expression vectors (Figure 2A lower

activity, and its mRNA expression were elevated by
p53 knockdown in p53-wild-type H1975 and CL3 cells.
The binding of p53 and Sp1 to the Nrf2 promoter was

decreased and increased by p53 silencing in both cell
types (Figure 2B). A ChIP analysis further indicated that
the binding of p53 to the Nrf2 promoter was decreased by

was increased in p53-knockdown H1975 and CL3 cells in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B lower panel). These
results suggest that p53 may interfere Sp1 binding to the
Nrf2 promoter to reduce its promoter activity.
We then constructed Nrf2 promoters mutated at
the p53 or Sp1 binding site by site-directed mutagenesis
to verify whether wild-type p53 could interact with
Sp1 to suppress Sp1 binding to the Nrf2 promoter. The
Nrf2 promoter activity was unchanged by transfection
with an Nrf2 promoter mutated at the p53 binding site
in H1299 VC cells and H1299 cells with mutant p53
expression vector transfections, but the promoter activity
was significantly elevated in H1299 cells transfected
with the Nrf2 wild-type promoter. However, the Nrf2
promoter activity was elevated by Nrf2 wild-type
promoter transfection in mutant p53-tranfected H1299
cells, but this promoter activity was completely eliminated
by transfection with an Nrf2 promoter mutated at the
Sp1 binding site in H1299 cells subjected to different
treatments (Figure 2C). On the other hand, the Nrf2
promoter activity was markedly increased by transfection
with an Nrf2 promoter mutated at the p53 binding site,
but the increase in the Nrf2 promoter activity in p53knockdown H1975 and CL3 cells was nearly completely
reversed by transfection with an Nrf2 promoter mutated
in the Sp1 binding site (Figure 2D). These results clearly
indicate that Nrf2 transcription in lung cancer cells is
predominately down-regulated by wild-type p53 via
decreased Sp1 binding to the Nrf2 promoter, but is not
affected by mutant p53.

(Supplementary Figure 1). These results clearly indicated
that Nrf2 expression is dependent on p53 status and may
confer cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells.
Nrf2 upregulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL transcription
and in turn confers drug resistance [22, 30]. HO-1 is
a downstream gene of the Nrf2/ARE signaling that
promotes tumor drug resistance [31-33]. The possibility
that wild-type p53-mediated Nrf2 reduction could promote
cisplatin sensitivity was explored by transfecting wildtype p53 into H1299 cells. Western blotting indicated
that Nrf2 expression was nearly completely eliminated by
wild-type p53 transfection in H1299 cells when compared
with VC cells (Figure 3B upper panel). As expected, the
decrease in Nrf2 expression in wild-type p53-transfected
H1299 cells was gradually increased by ectopic expression
of Nrf2. As expected, p53-downstream p21 expression
was increased by wild-type p53 overexpression in H1299
cells, but was decreased by wild-type p53 knockdown in
H1975 cells. The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and HO-1
was concomitantly elevated by ectopic expression of
Nrf2 in wild-type p53-transfected H1299 cells. The IC50
value for cisplatin in H1299 cells was markedly decreased
by wild-type p53 transfection, but the IC50 value
was gradually increased by co-transfection with Nrf2
expression vector in H1299 cells (19.6 μM vs. 8.6 μM vs.
13.2 μM vs. 18.4 μM; Figure 3B left lower panel). The
increase in Nrf2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and HO-1 expressions
were observed in p53-knockdown H1975 cells, but the
increases of these three molecules were reversed by Nrf2
silencing in p53-knockdown H1975 cells (Figure 3B,
right upper panel). The IC50 value of p53-knockdown
H1975 cells was increased to 16.2 μM when compared
with H1975 cells with non-specific shRNA transfection
(NC) (5.6 μM). However, the increase in the IC50 value
in p53-knockdown H1975 cells was suppressed by Nrf-2
silencing in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B, right
lower panel). Annexin-V/PI assay further indicated that
the percentages of cell apoptosis in both cell types were
elevated and reduced by p53 manipulation (Supplementary
Figure 2). These results suggest that Nrf2-mediated Bcl2, Bcl-xL and HO-1 is dependent on p53 status and may
confer cisplatin resistance via apoptotic machinery.

Nrf2-mediated Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and HO-1
expression is dependent on p53 status and may
confer cisplatin resistance
We investigated whether Nrf2 expression could
determine cisplatin sensitivity in lung cancer cells that had
different p53 status. Two types of p53-null cells (H1299
and H358) and three types of p53-wild-type cells (H1975,
CL3, and TL4) were collected to evaluate the inhibitory
concentration yielding 50% cell viability (IC50) for
cisplatin using the MTT assay. Western blotting showed
that Nrf2 expression was decreased by Nrf2 knockdown
in H1299 and H358 cells, but was dose-dependently
increased by Nrf2 overexpression in H1975, CL3, and
TL4 cells (Figure 3A upper panel). Intriguingly, the IC50
value for cisplatin was concomitantly decreased by Nrf2knockdown in H1299 and H358 cells, but was increased in
Nrf2-overexpressing H1975, CL3, and TL4 cells (Figure
3A lower panel). However, the IC50 value for cisplatin
was nearly unchanged by different mutant p53 expression
vector transfections in H1299 cells when compared with
VC cells; however, the IC50 value for cisplatin was almost
completely rescued by Nrf2 knockdown in H1299 cells
transfected with different mutant p53 expression vectors

Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are more involved than HO-1 in
Nrf2-mediated cisplatin resistance
We next examined which genes regulated by Nrf2
were more involved in cisplatin resistance. High Nrf2
expressing H1299 cells were selected for transfection with
shHO-1, shBcl-2, or shBcl-xL, and low Nrf2 expressing
H1975 cells were transfected with the Nrf2 expression
vector and then co-transfected with shHO-1, shBcl-2, or
shBcl-xL. The MTT assay results showed that the IC50
value of H1299 and Nrf2-overexpressing H1975 cells
was markedly decreased by shHO-1, shBcl-2, or shBcl41697

xL, when compared with H1299 NC cells and Nrf2overexpressing H1975 cells (Figure 4). Interestingly, the
IC50 value was lower for both cell types transfected with
shBcl-2 or shBcl-xL than for both cell types transfected
with shHO-1 (Figure 4). These results clearly indicated
that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are more involved than HO-1 in
Nrf2-mediated cisplatin resistance.

We examined whether Nrf2 mRNA expression
levels could be associated with p53 status in NSCLC
patients. In total, 114 tumors from surgically resected
NSCLC patients, who were determined not to have keap1
and Nrf2 mutation (n = 109, Supplementary Table 1), were
evaluated for Nrf2 mRNA expression levels using real-

into high Nrf2-expressing (H1299 and H358) cell lines compared with both cell types transfected with a non-specific shRNA (NC), Nrf2

an empty vector (VC). After 24h, the indicated cells were incubated with or without cisplatin (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 μM) for 48 h for MTT assay.

time PCR. The median value of Nrf2 mRNA expression
levels in lung tumors was used as a cutoff point to divide
patients into high-Nrf2 and low-Nrf2 subgroups and the
categories were further confirmed by a box plot analysis
(Supplementary Figure 3). The p53 mutation data were
obtained from our previous reports [34, 35]. Nrf2 mRNA
expression was not associated with clinico-pathological
parameters, including age, gender, smoking status, tumor
histology, and stage. Interestingly, high-Nrf2 mRNA
tumors were more commonly observed in p53-mutant
patients than in p53-wild-type patients (70.8% vs. 43.5%,
p = 0.018; Table 1). High Bcl-2 and high Bcl-xL mRNA
expression were more prevalently occurred in high-Nrf2
mRNA tumors than in low-Nrf2 mRNA tumors (59.3%
vs. 40%, p = 0.044 for Bcl-2; 61.1% vs. 38.2%, p = 0.017;
Table 1).
We next examined the possibility that Nrf2 mRNA
expression levels could be associated with the tumor
response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In total, 60
of the 109 patients were available for this retrospective
study, and data indicated that an unfavorable response to
cisplatin-based chemotherapy was more likely in patients

with high-Nrf2 mRNA tumors than with low-Nrf2
mRNA tumors (71.9% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.001; Table 2).
Similar findings in an unfavorable response to cisplatinbased chemotherapy were more commonly observed
in high-Bcl-2 or high-Bcl-xL mRNA tumors than their
counterparts (62.5% vs. 32.1% for Bcl-2; 66.7% vs.
33.3%, p = 0.01; Table 2). We further showed that an
unfavorable response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy
was more common in p53-mutant patients who harbored
high-Nrf2 mRNA tumors than low-Nrf2 tumors (70%
vs. 15.8%, p = 0.004; Table 2). These results suggested
that high-Nrf2 mRNA patients whose tumors harbored
p53 mutations may more frequently show an unfavorable
response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy when compared
with patients whose tumors harbored wild-type p53. Bcl2 and Bcl-xL expression may be partially contributive to
Nrf2-mediated unfavorable response to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy in NSCLC patients.

Nrf2 mRNA expression levels are associated with
overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival
(RFS) in NSCLC patients

prognostic significance of p53 status on OS and RFS was
not revealed in all studied cases or in the 60 patients who
had received cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Table 2).
We also found worse RFS in p53-mutant patients who
harbored high-Nrf2 tumors rather than low-Nrf2 mRNA
tumors (HR, 2.269, 95% CI, 1.02-5.07, p = 0.046; Table
3), but a prognostic value for OS was not observed in
the high-Nrf2 patients. The chemotherapeutic regimens
for these sixty patients are listed in Supplementary Table
2. These patients received cisplatin alone (8.3%) and/or
combined with other chemotherapeutic agents including
gemcitabine (73.3%), vp16 (8.3%), taxol (8.3%), and
mitomycin C (1.7%). These results suggest that high Nrf2
mRNA expression levels may be useful for prediction
of poorer OS and RFS in NSCLC patients. A prognostic
significance of Nrf2 mRNA levels on OS and RFS was
also observed in patients who had received cisplatin-based
chemotherapy.

We next examined the possibility that Nrf2 mRNA
expression levels could be associated with OS and RFS in
NSCLC patients. Cox regression analysis using all studied
population (n = 109) indicated that high-Nrf2 mRNA
patients exhibited worse OS and RFS than low-Nrf2
mRNA patients (hazard ratio, HR, 2.014, 95% CI, 1.033.87, p = 0.013 for OS; HR, 2.047, 95% CI, 1.17-4.069,
p = 0.022 for RFS; Table 3). The five-year survival rate
and median survival month for OS and RFS were lower
and shorter in high-Nrf2 mRNA patients than in lowNrf2 mRNA patients (OS: 12.3% vs. 36.8% for five-year
survival rate, 22.3 months vs. 45.3 months; RFS: 3.9%
vs. 14.8% for five-year survival rate, 13.4 months vs. 22.3
months).
A prognostic significance of Nrf2 mRNA expression
levels on OS and RFS was still observed in 60 patients
who have received cisplatin-based chemotherapy (HR,

Moreover, a decrease in Nrf2 mRNA expression by wildtype p53 corresponded with its protein expression. These
findings suggest that Nrf2 expression is predominately
regulated by wild-type p53 at the transcription level.
Conversely, Nrf2 mRNA and its protein expression levels
in H1299 cells were markedly elevated by different mutant
p53 expression vector transfections when compared with
VC cells (Figure 1C). A previous report has indicated
that Nrf2 expression is driven by the NF-κB signaling
pathway in acute myeloid leukemia [23]. Mutation of p53
gene prolongs NF-κB activation and promotes chronic
inflammation and inflammation-associated colorectal
cancer [36]. Therefore, mutant p53 not only confers drug
resistance via upregulation of Nrf2 expression but it also
may activate the NF-κB signaling pathway for additional
enhancement of Nrf2 expression (Figure 1C).
The prevalence of “low” or “high” Nrf2 expression
was not significantly revealed in p53-wild-type patients
compared with p53-mutant patients. This conflicting
may be due to wild-type p53 dysfunction by several
mechanisms. For example, Nrf2 may promote MDM2
expression to increase p53 degradation [28]. An early
report indicated that MDM2 mRNA expression may be
used to predict p53 transcriptional function and patients’
prognosis in NSCLC [37]. We thus evaluated MDM2
mRNA expression in p53-wild-type patients by real-time
PCR in this study population and data showed that high

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Nrf2 mRNA expression was more commonly occurred
in low-MDM2 mRNA tumors than in high-MDM2
tumors (Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, wild-type
p53 dysfunction by different mechanisms may cause
p53 wild-type patients with high Nrf2 mRNA tumors,
and consequently resulting in the prevalence of “low” or
“high” Nrf2 expression to be not significantly revealed in
p53-wild-type patients..
ROS levels are tightly controlled by the Nrf2/Keap1
pathway [38]. However, an increased in Nrf2 transcription,
that were triggered by oncogenes such as mutations in
K-rasG12D and BrafV619V and overexpression of MycERT2,
promotes ROS detoxification and tumorigenesis [38].
K-ras increases Nrf2 gene transcription through a TPA
response element located on the Nrf2 promoter [24]. In
a mouse model of mutant K-rasG12D-induced lung cancer,
suppressing the Nrf2 pathway with the chemical inhibitor
Brusatol enhanced the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin
[24]. These results strongly suggest that oncogenic K-ras
promotes tumor malignancy as well as conferring cisplatin
resistance in lung cancer through upregulation of Nrf2
transcription. However, K-ras mutations were not detected
in this study population (n = 114, data not shown). In the
present study, mutant p53 upregulated Nrf2 transcription
by increased Sp1 binding to the Nrf2 promoter, thereby
conferring cisplatin resistance. Consistent findings were
also observed in wild-type p53 cells subjected to p53
silencing and in p53-null cells transfected with different
mutant p53 expression vectors. We therefore suggest that
mutant p53 may confer cisplatin resistance in lung cancer

cells via upregulating Nrf2 transcription.
In summary, we provide evidence that upregulation
of Nrf2 transcription by mutant p53 may confer cisplatin
resistance, an unfavorable response to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, and poor outcomes in NSCLC patients.
Therefore, we suggest that Bcl-2 antagonists might be
helpful in improving cisplatin sensitivity and outcomes
in p53-mutant NSCLC patients who harbor high-Nrf2
mRNA tumors.

Plasmid constructs and transfection assays
Nrf2 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) by PCR amplification
with newly created XhoI and BamHI sites attached on the
Nrf2 5’ends of forward and reverse primers, using H1299
cDNA as template. The Nrf2 promoter reporter plasmid
was constructed by inserting 1036, 740, and 229 bps KpnI/
HidIII fragments into a KpnI/HidIII-treated pGL3 vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The primer sequences
are listed in Supplementary Table 5. The wild-type and
mutant p53 constructs were kindly provided by Dr. JiunnLiang Ko (Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical
University, Taichung, Taiwan) [43]. The shRNA was
purchased from National RNAi Core Facility, Academia
Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. Different concentrations of
plasmids were transiently transfected into lung cancer cells
(1 × 106 cells) using the Turbofect reagent (Fermentas,
Waltham, MA, USA). After 48 h, cells were harvested and
whole-cell extracts were used for subsequent experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects
Lung tumor specimens were collected from 114
primary lung cancer at the Department of Thoracic
Surgery, Taichung Veterans General Hospital (Taichung,
Taiwan), between 1998 and 2004. Patients were asked to
submit written informed consent and were approved by the
Institutional Review Board (Institutional Review Board,
Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, CSMUH No:
CS11177). The tumor type and stage of each collected
specimen were histologically determined according to the
World Health Organization classification system. Cancer
relapse data were obtained by chart review and confirmed
by thoracic surgeons. Clinical parameters and OS and
RFS data were collected from chart reviews and the
Taiwan Cancer Registry, Ministry of Health and Welfare,
Executive Yuan, ROC.

Real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression
levels
DNase I-treated total RNA (10 ng) was subjected
to real-time PCR analysis with the Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), mRNA Assays
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), using a
Real-Time Thermocycler 7500 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the mRNA
reference housekeeping gene. The primers used for realtime PCR analysis of mRNA expression are presented in
Supplementary Table 5.

Cell lines and culture conditions
H1299, H1355, H1650, H1975 and H358 cells
were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and
were cultured as previously described (http://www.atcc.
org). CL1-5 and CL3 cells were kindly provided by
Dr. Pan-Chyr Yang (Department of Internal Medicine,
National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan). TL4 cells
were kindly provided by Dr. Ya-Wen Cheng (Graduate
Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, Taipei
Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan). H1299 cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Hyclone,
Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone, Waltham, MA, USA). CL1-5,
CL3, H1355, H1650, H1975, H358 and TL4 cells were
grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Hyclone, Waltham,
MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The type
of p53 mutations in eight cell lines has been listed in
Supplementary Table 4. All cell lines were grown at 37°C
in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. These cells were
cultured according to the suppliers’ instructions and were
stored used at passages 5 to 20. Once resuscitated, cell
lines were routinely authenticated (once every 6 months;
cells were last tested in December 2012) through cell
