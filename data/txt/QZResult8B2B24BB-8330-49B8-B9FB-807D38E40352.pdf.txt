ABSTRACT
Recent data implicate elevated transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling
in BRAF inhibitor drug-resistance mechanisms, but the potential for targeting TGFβ
signalling in cases of advanced melanoma has not been investigated. We show
that mutant BRAFV600E confers an intrinsic dependence on TGFβ/TGFβ receptor
1 (TGFBR1) signalling for clonogenicity of murine melanocytes. Pharmacological
inhibition of the TGFBR1 blocked the clonogenicity of human mutant BRAF melanoma
cells through SMAD4-independent inhibition of mitosis, and also inhibited metastasis
in xenografted zebrafish. When investigating the therapeutic potential of combining
inhibitors of mutant BRAF and TGFBR1, we noted that unexpectedly, low-dose PLX4720 (a vemurafenib analogue) promoted proliferation of drug-naïve melanoma cells.
Pharmacological or pharmacogenetic inhibition of TGFBR1 blocked growth promotion
and phosphorylation of SRC, which is frequently associated with vemurafenibresistance mechanisms. Importantly, vemurafenib-resistant patient derived cells
retained sensitivity to TGFBR1 inhibition, suggesting that TGFBR1 could be targeted
therapeutically to combat the development of vemurafenib drug-resistance.

constitutively activate the RAS-RAF-mitogen activated

(RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) signalling pathway are frequently
detected in melanoma; mutations in BRAF and NRAS
have been detected in approximately 50% and 20% of
melanomas, respectively [2]. The identification of genetic
drivers of melanoma [2] has led to the development of
small-molecule inhibitors inhibitors (e.g. vemurafenib,

dabrafenib) (BRAFi), which selectively target mutant
BRAF. Their use in the clinic has significantly increased
survival of metastatic melanoma patients [3-5]. However,
the development of drug resistance remains a significant
problem with the vast majority of patients with advanced
melanoma dying of drug-resistant disease.
Numerous mechanisms of resistance to BRAF
inhibitors have been described, many involving
reactivation of the MAPK pathway (reviewed in [6]). As
a result, the combined use of BRAF inhibitors with MEK
inhibitors (e.g. cobimetinib, trametinib) has been proposed
as a way to overcome the development of resistance [79]. While this approach significantly improves patient
survival (resulting in a median expected survival of
approximately 25 months for eligible patients), the
efficacy of combinatorial therapies which target the same
signalling pathway ultimately may be limited because of
augmented BRAF inhibitor drug resistance mechanisms or
secondary mutations [10, 11].
Additionally, secondary epigenetic events that do
not necessarily affect MEK/ERK activity can occur to
limit the tumour cells’ dependence on the MAPK pathway,
or restrict tumour immune surveillance. These resistance
mechanisms include changes in the methylome affecting
tumour cell apoptosis [12], increases in PI3K/AKT activity
[13-15] and/or increases in receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) signalling. For instance, loss of microphthalmiaassociated transcription factor (MITF) expression
correlates with increased RTK expression and resistance
[16]. Vemurafenib-resistance induced increases in EGFR
signalling have been shown to activate an EGFR-SRCSTAT3 signalling cascade in melanoma, and targeting
this pathway using inhibitors of SRC inhibits growth of
vemurafenib-resistant xenografts [17, 18].
As well as cell autonomous effects, drug-induced
stimulation of melanoma-associated fibroblasts stimulates
matrix remodelling and, in this case, signals via integrins
to increase SRC and FAK activity. This change in the
microenvironment promotes melanoma cell survival and
provides a “safe haven” to enable emergence of drugresistant tumour cells [19]. Clearly, stromal remodelling
and SRC activation have emerged as contributors to BRAF
inhibitor resistance, and it is apparent that the therapyinduced secretome is key in driving resistance. Increased
transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) secretion may
be part of the therapy-induced secretome, and has been
implicated in both in vitro derived drug resistance [20] and
in vemurafenib-resistant patient material [21]. Increased
TGFβ signalling can result in an upregulation of EGFR
and PDGFR [21], positioning TGFβ signalling upstream
of well described vemurafenib-resistance associated RTK
pathways. Despite this, the potential for TGFβ pathway
inhibitors in combating BRAF kinase inhibitor resistance
has not been studied to date.
TGFβ ligand binds to the constitutively active high
affinity type 2 serine/threonine kinase receptor TGFBR2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which trans-phosphorylates and activates TGFBR1.
As part of the canonical signalling pathway, TGFBR1
phosphorylates and activates the intracellular signalling
transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3, and following
binding to SMAD4, the SMAD complex accumulates in
the nucleus where it regulates target gene transcription.
Additionally, TGFβ can signal via numerous noncanonical pathways including RHO/ROCK, MAPK, and
PI3-Kinase (reviewed in [22]). In normal melanocytes,
TGFβ inhibits proliferation and DNA synthesis and
induces melanocyte stem cell quiescence, however,
melanoma cells are able to evade the tumour suppressive
effects of TGFβ. TGFβ levels are elevated in the plasma of
melanoma patients (regardless of their exposure to BRAF
inhibitors), and increases in expression are associated with
progressive disease [23]. The mechanisms of growth arrest
and their evasion by melanoma cells, however, have not
been fully characterised and are likely to be multi-factorial
(reviewed in [24]).
There is little evidence of mutation of TGFβ
receptors in melanoma [25], so, it appears that with
functional receptors and apparently intact SMAD function
[26, 27], melanoma cells are able to evade growth
suppressive effects of TGFβ while simultaneously utilising
pro-tumourigenic functions of TGFβ. TGFβ signalling
promotes migration of BRAF-transformed melanocytes
in in vitro organotypic skin cultures [28] and is involved
in metastasis of mouse melanoma cells to the bone through
expression of tissue-specific genes known to promote bone
osteolysis [26, 29]. In addition, melanoma cells engineered
to over-express TGFβ exert paracrine effects on stromal
fibroblasts whereby they secrete matrix components
(including fibronectin, collagens, and tenascin) to promote
melanoma tumour formation [30]. These observations
are reminiscent of the vemurafenib-induced activation
of melanoma-associated fibroblasts providing a “safe
haven” for melanoma tumour cells, however, no link has
been formally established between vemurafenib-induced
fibroblast activation and TGFβ signalling.
In this study, we now provide evidence that
melanoma cells are “hard-wired” to depend on
autocrine TGFβ signalling through TGFBR1 for tumour
establishment and clonogenicity. We show that the
fundamental addiction of melanoma cells to TGFβ is:
induced by the presence of mutant BRAF; mediated by a
SMAD4-independent pathway; and correlates with TGFβ
regulation of RHOA activity, thus providing support
for the notion that non-canonical signalling pathways
are key mediators of pro-tumourigenic TGFβ function
in melanoma. Importantly, we also provide evidence
that vemurafenib resistant patient-derived cells retain
sensitivity to inhibitors of TGFBR1. TGFBR1 inhibitors
block the enhanced proliferation of paradoxically activated
PLX-4720 treated melanoma cells, and can be used to
effectively inhibit metastatic melanoma in a zebrafish
xenograft model.

RESULTS

at 10µM (Figure 1d and 1e). Similar dose dependent
effects were seen in anchorage-independent soft agar
assays (Figure 1f). We attempted to select out TGFBR1
inhibitor-resistant cells following repeated rounds of
treatment for over a month, but saw no evidence of
outgrowth of refractory subpopulations or acquiredresistance during this time frame (Figure 1g). Taken
together these data suggest that cells with mutational
activation of BRAF, require TGFBR1 for efficient colony
formation and that TGFβ would predictably function as a
tumour promoter.

Mutant BRAF confers TGFβ addiction
We demonstrated previously that autocrine
signalling through TGFBR1, is required for transformation
of rodent fibroblasts by oncogenic BRAF [31], but did not
investigate this dependence in human models of activated
RAS/RAF-driven cancer. Since mutational activation of
BRAF is frequently observed in melanoma [2], we tested
the susceptibility of immortalised mouse melanocytes
stably transfected with either wild-type or mutant BRAF
to inhibition by the TGFBR1 kinase inhibitor SB-431542.
Unlike parental or wildtype BRAF transfected cells,
melanocytes transfected with oncogenic V600E BRAF
required TGFBR1 kinase activity for their proliferation
since SB-431542 decreased cell numbers (Figure 1a).
These data suggest that the presence of mutant BRAF in
melanocytes confers a dependence (or addiction) on the
TGFβ/TGFBR1 signalling pathway for cell proliferation.
Similar results were observed in soft agar assays
measuring anchorage independent growth (Figure 1b). We
determined the amount of autocrine TGFβ produced by
the transfected melanocytes, using a bioassay of NIH3T3
cells stably transfected with a CAGA12-luciferase reporter
construct (Supplementary Figure 1a). The dependence on
TGFBR1 activity for colony formation did not correlate
simply with an increase in latent autocrine TGFβ
production following transfection with mutant BRAF (no
active TGFβ was detectable without medium acidification)
(Supplementary Figure 1b). There was also no elevated
signalling via the TGFβ receptor-regulated intracellular
signalling transcription factor, SMAD2 in SB-431542
sensitive cells (Supplementary Figure 1c).
We tested whether human cancer cells with
activating mutations in MAPK pathway components
were also dependent on TGFBR1 for growth. A panel of
human tumour cell lines carrying wild type RAS/BRAF
or mutations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS or NRAS (details
of all cell lines are given in Supplementary Table 1) were
tested for sensitivity to SB-431542 (Figure 1c). Inhibition
of TGFBR1 resulted in a range of cellular responses in the
wildtype, H-, K-, and N-RAS mutant groups, such that any
dependence on TGFBR1 for colony formation could not
be predicted in cells carrying these mutations. However,
consistent with data obtained in mouse melanocytes
(Figure 1b), colony formation in all seven human cell
lines carrying mutant BRAF was significantly inhibited
(Figure 1c). Again, sensitivity to the TGFBR1 inhibitor
did not correlate with levels of autocrine TGFβ production
(Supplementary Table S2). The effect of SB-431542 was
dose-dependent in low density 2D-culture assay conditions
established to assess more accurately clonogenic potential,
reaching statistically significant inhibitory concentrations

Autocrine TGFβ is required for in vivo melanoma
xenograft tumour formation
Melanoma cells engineered to over-express TGFβ1
have increased tumour forming ability [30]. To discover
whether endogenous autocrine TGFβ expression is
required for tumour formation, we generated ligand
knockdown clones of A375(M2) cells using stably
transfected shRNA constructs targeting TGFβ1.
Knockdown of TGFβ1 to levels below 20pg per 1x105
cells/hr (Figure 2a) was sufficient to decrease the ability
of A375(M2) cells to form colonies in vitro (Figure 2b
and Supplementary Figure 2a). In xenograft assays,
ligand knockdown reduced the percentage of mice with
palpable tumours at all recorded time-points (Figure 2c),
and significantly reduced tumour growth (Figure 2d).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of xenograft sections
revealed increased expression of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor CDKN1A (p21CIP1) in tumours generated
by TGFβ knockdown cells (Figure 2e and 2f). Elevated
CDKN1ACIP1 expression was also observed following
SB-431542 treatment of A375(M2) cells (Supplementary
Figure 2b).
So far, our data implicate autocrine TGFβ signalling
through TGFBR1 as a critical factor in melanoma
clonogenicity and tumour formation, however, it was
important to rule out off-target effects of the inhibitor.
We therefore assessed colony formation following
transient transfection with two independent siRNAs
targeting TGFBR1. TGFBR1 knockdown (Supplementary
Figure 3a) reduced TGFBR1 protein expression and
phosphorylation of SMAD2 in response to exogenous
TGFβ (Figures 3a and 3b), and recapitulated the effect
of chemical inhibition of the receptor. Colony formation
and cell proliferation decreased following TGFBR1
knockdown (Figure 3c, 3d, and Supplementary Figure
3b and 3c), confirming that TGFBR1 is required for
melanoma colony formation.
To discover whether the canonical SMAD pathway
is required for either melanoma cell colony formation
or for the inhibitory response to SB-431542, transient
knockdown of the co-SMAD, SMAD4 was performed.
Knockdown of SMAD4 (Figure 3e) had no significant

effect on A375(M2) colony formation (Figure 3f)
and significantly increased Colo829 cell proliferation
(Figure 3g). These data suggest that SMAD4-dependent
signalling is not necessary for colony outgrowth and may,
in fact, repress colony growth in Colo829 cells. SMAD4
knockdown also did not block the inhibitory effect of
SB-431542 (Figure 3h), indicating that the mechanism
of inhibition is SMAD4 independent. In case the levels
of knockdown were not sufficient to accurately assess
the contribution of SMAD4, we tested a mutant BRAF/
SMAD4 null cell line (HT29). These cells were also
sensitive to TGFBR1 inhibition (Supplementary Figure
4a and 4b) thus supporting our conclusion that functional
SMAD4 is not necessary for inhibition of colony
formation by SB-431542.
We next considered any non-canonical signalling
pathways that might be affected by TGFβ signalling
in melanoma cells. We previously reported that a noncanonical TGFβ/TGFBR1/RHOA signalling pathway
is necessary for initiation and maintenance of rodent
fibroblast BRAFV600E transformed cultures [31]. Thus,
in mutant BRAF human melanoma cells, it seemed
plausible that this pathway could be involved in
regulating melanoma cell clonogenicity. SB-431542
treatment reduced levels of active-GTP bound RHOA
(Supplementary Figure 4c), while transfection of
melanoma cells with the exoenzyme C3 transferase to
inhibit RHOA [32] mimicked the effect SB-431542
(Supplementary Figure 4d). In addition, overexpression
of either constitutively active RHOA, or the constitutively
active RHOA specific guanine nucleotide exchange
factors ∆558LARG or onco-LBC (to activate endogenous
RHOA) [33], blocked the effect of the TGFBR1 inhibitor
on colony formation (Supplementary Figure 4e). These
data are consistent with our previous findings in rodent
fibroblasts.
To gain further insight into the cellular pathways
involved in the inhibition of colony formation, we
analysed cells by microscopy for division and apoptosis,
using BRDU incorporation or fluorogenic apoptosis
reagents respectively. Initial experiments revealed that
SB-431542 treatment significantly reduced BRDU
incorporation but induced little apoptosis (Supplementary
Figure 5a and data not shown). We questioned whether
an apparently modest reduction in BRDU incorporation
was sufficient to account for the dramatic reduction in
colony formation and cell proliferation. To investigate
in more detail, we generated A375(M2) cell lines stably
transfected with an H2B-red fluorescent protein (RFP)
fusion protein expression construct to enable kinetic single
cell tracking using IncuCyte imaging. Imaging between
days four and six of treatment (Supplementary Figure
5b) showed a reduction in their number, and a significant
increase in the length of time cells remained in interphase
(Supplementary Figure 5c). There were slight increases in
the mean number of cells that failed to enter into mitosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or detached upon treatment, but these differences did not
reach statistical significance (Supplementary Figure 5d
and 5e). TGFBR1 inhibition, therefore, predominantly
affects the proportion of cells in S-phase, and significantly
affects the clonogenic potential of BRAF mutant cells
through effects on the cell cycle.

BRAF inhibitor resistance
The addiction of mutant BRAF melanoma cells to
signalling through TGFBR1 suggests a potential novel
therapeutic approach for mutant BRAF-driven cancers.
Ideally, not only would a novel treatment be effective
as a single agent without evidence of refractory disease
(Figure 1), but the novel therapeutic drug would act in
combination with existing therapies to enhance their
efficacy or prevent the development of resistance. The
current therapeutic modality for mutant BRAF metastatic
melanoma is treatment with BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib
or dabrafenib in combination with MEK inhibitors for
suitable patients. However, the development of BRAF
inhibitor-resistant disease through a variety of different
mechanisms, including the paradoxical activation of the
MAPK pathway, remains a significant clinical problem.
To assess the potential for a combination therapy
targeting both BRAF and TGFBR1, we first tested the
sensitivity of previously drug naïve A375(M2) and
Colo829 to the mutant BRAF kinase inhibitor PLX4720 in our clonogenic, low density assay conditions. As
expected, at doses exceeding 250nM, growth of both cell
lines was inhibited, however, at lower doses, we noted
an unexpected significant increase in cell proliferation
(Figures 4a, 4b and Supplementary Figure 6a).
Suboptimal doses of PLX-4720 induced phosphorylation
of ERK (Supplementary Figure 6b), and the enhanced
proliferation of Colo829 (Figure 4c) and A375(M2) cells
(data not shown) were abrogated by co-treatment with
the MEK inhibitor PD184352 (Figure 4c). These data
are consistent with low dose PLX-4720 paradoxically
activating the RAS-MAPK pathway. Since both cell lines
carry BRAFV600E and are wild type for RAS, the most
likely interpretation is that low dose PLX-4720 relieves
an inhibitory autophosphorylation [34]. Consistent with
this hypothesis, low dose PLX-4720 did not promote the
proliferation of three melanoma cell lines carrying wild
type RAF/RAS (Supplementary Figure 7). Importantly cotreatment of PLX-4720 treated mutant BRAF cells with
SB-431542 (10µM) abolished the increase in cell growth
caused by low dose PLX-4720 (Figure 4d and 4e). We
quantified the effect on clonogenicity [35] and showed that
not only did SB-431542 significantly reduce clonogenicity
as a single agent, but that the significant increase in
clonogenicity induced by PLX-4720 alone was reversed
by SB-431542 (Figure 4f and Supplementary Figure 6c).
This result was recapitulated by siRNA knockdown of
TGFBR1 (Figure 4g).

by SB-431542. Importantly, in vitro derived PLX-4720
resistant A375R cells (cultured in the presence of 1µM
PLX-4720) were growth inhibited by SB-431542 (Figure
5a). The patient-derived vemurafenib resistant cells had
readily detectable levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 that
were reduced on SB-431542 treatment, indicating that
they all had active autocrine TGFβ signalling (Figure
5c). In addition, all vemurafenib-resistant lines derived
from patients were growth inhibited by SB-431542 in
proliferation assays (Figure 5d) and in longer term colony
formation assays (Figure 5e). Vemurafenib resistant cells
therefore retain their sensitivity to inhibitors of the TGFβ
signalling pathway.
Several reports indicate that the development of
resistance to BRAF kinase inhibitors may be associated
with signalling through SRC-family kinases, and that
resistance can be overcome by inhibition of SRC
activity [17-19, 36]. We therefore tested whether TGFβ
signalling was associated with SRC phosphorylation in
A375(M2) and Colo829 cells (Figure 6). We noted that
phosphorylated-SRC levels increased during the five day
incubation period in cells initially plated at low density.
SB-431542 (10µM) (Figure 6a) and TGFBR1 siRNA
(Figure 6b) prevented any accumulation of phosphorylated
SRC during the time course, and SB-431542 blocked an
increase in phospho-SRC levels induced by low-dose
PLX-4720 in A375(M2) cells (Figure 6a). An important
implication of these data is that inhibition of TGFBR1
signalling may restrict signalling through a known
mediator of vemurafenib resistance.

cells at higher cell numbers also reduced the efficacy of
SB-431542 in both vemurafenib naïve and resistant cells
(Supplementary Figure 8b). Given these observations, we
posit that cell:cell contact and/or allowing the secretion
of growth factors or matrix components has a protective
effect against TGFBR1 inhibitors; the implication is that
TGFBR1 inhibitors might not be useful as first line, single
agents or as debulking therapeutic agents in established
solid tumours. Nevertheless, the dependence of melanoma
cells on TGFBR1 for clonogenicity suggests that TGFBR1
inhibitors could be effective in preventing spread or
outgrowth of micrometastases. To test this hypothesis
we used a zebrafish embryo metastasis model [37, 38]
to visualise and quantify numbers of invasive melanoma
cells. This model has been used successfully to examine
the effect of SB-431542 on breast cancer cell invasion
[39]. We generated stable TGFBR1 knockdown A375(M2)
cell lines using LMP-TGFBR1 shRNA plasmids, which
had reduced TGFBR1 protein expression and reduced
capacity to signal (Figure 7a) as well as reduced ability
to form colonies on plastic (Figure 7b). The stable lines
were labelled with the mCherry fluorophore, injected into
the Duct of Cuvier (DoC) of zebrafish embryos and the
numbers of invasive cells in the avascular tail fins were
analysed. Representative con-focal images of metastatic
spread into the tail fin are shown in Figure 7c. Control
non-silencing (NS) A375(M2) cells were capable of
metastatic spread into the fish fin (arrows indicate micrometastases). Using doses of 1µM SB-431542 (SBi), we
observed a significant decrease in the ability of SB-431542
treated NS cells to invade. Stable TGFBR1 knockdown
also reduced colonisation of zebrafish tissue (Figure 7d).
Our data overall suggest that TGFBR1 inhibitors would
reduce the metastatic burden in BRAF mutant melanoma
by preventing invasion and/or outgrowth of metastatic
colonies.

DISCUSSION
The outcome for patients with advanced melanoma
has improved dramatically in recent years. The
development of targeted therapy of the MAPK pathway,
and advances in immunotherapy have resulted in
improvements in median survival from 9 months to 25-31
months. However, long-term prognosis remains uncertain.
For targeted therapy using BRAFi, drug resistance
mechanisms identified to date are numerous, and there is
no established effective second-line targeted therapy for
patients progressing on combination BRAFi + MEKi.
Often, drug-resistance mechanisms involve induction of
either an autocrine, or a paracrine, drug-induced secretome
which helps to promote expansion and dissemination of
the drug-resistant cells [15] and/or protect potentially
sensitive tumour cells from the inhibitory effects of the
chemotherapeutic agent [15, 19, 21]. Phosphorylated
ERK and SRC are frequently elevated in resistant tumours

Zebrafish embryo xenograft metastasis model
So far, our murine xenograft assays, and inhibition
of clonogenic potential of melanoma cells in low cell
density 3D and 2D culture systems, suggest that TGFBR1
inhibitors would be effective in preventing establishment
of disease. To further examine whether TGFBR1
inhibitors could effectively treat established cell cultures,
we seeded cells at low cell density and progressively
delayed addition of drug throughout the lag phase of
cell growth. SB-431542 was effective if administered
during the lag phase, but delaying treatment until the
cells start to exit the lag phase considerably reduced its
efficacy (Supplementary Figure 8a). Similarly, seeding

[18] suggesting that paradoxical activation of the MAPK
pathway and growth factor signalling are involved in
resistance development. In this study we investigated the
potential of targeting TGFβ1 as second-line therapy for
advanced melanoma.
We found that autocrine TGFβ signalling through
TGFBR1 is an intrinsic requirement for the clonogenic
potential of mutant BRAF transformed cells, indicating
that mutation of BRAF may be useful as a biomarker for
TGFβ tumour promoting activity in melanoma. Although
TGFβ levels are elevated post-vemurafenib treatment [20,
21], our data suggest that a TGFβ/TGFBR1-dependent
state is an adaptation to the presence of mutant BRAF.
Thus, with pro-tumourigenic autocrine TGFβ signalling
pathways having already been established, elevated levels
of signalling during therapy are perhaps more readily
selected for than would otherwise be the case. How the
initial switch from tumour suppressor to tumour promoter
function of TGFβ in melanocytes is mediated by mutant
BRAF remains to be determined.
Our in vitro assays were specifically designed to
mimic conditions of cellular stress (i.e. low density 2D
and anchorage independent colony formation assays)
to more accurately assess the clonogenic potential of
melanoma cells and their cancer stem-cell like properties.
TGFBR1 inhibition was highly effective in inhibiting
growth of both naïve and vemurafenib-resistant cells when
administered during the lag phase of growth; less so when
cell seeding numbers were increased. The implication of
these data is that targeting TGFβ/TGFBR1 may not be
an effective therapeutic strategy in established tumours.
A secondary consideration is that TGFBR1 inhibition
affected proliferation of the tumour cells without inducing
apoptosis, and so may not result in significant tumour
shrinkage. As a consequence, we predicted that inhibiting

TGFβ/TGFBR1 signalling would more likely be effective
in preventing tumour metastasis and outgrowth of
micrometastasis, rather than reducing established tumour
burden. Indeed, our murine and zebrafish xenograft
models show that targeting autocrine TGFβ secretion
and TGFBR1 kinase activity inhibits xenograft tumour
establishment in mice and prevents metastatic spread in
zebrafish tissues. TGFBR1 inhibitors therefore may have
potential as an adjuvant therapy in high risk, resected
disease, or a maintenance therapy in patients responding
to BRAF inhibitors. The inhibition of glioblastoma cancer
initiating (stem) cells by TGFBR1 inhibitors [40, 41] is
consistent with our data, and provides support for our
conclusion that TGFBR1 activity is required for melanoma
stem-cell like properties.
Given the vast number of context specific genes
regulated by TGFβ, it is likely that a number of different
downstream effectors will mediate the autocrine TGFβinduced promotion of melanoma cell growth and
drug-resistance. We showed that although melanoma
cells rely on TGFBR1 kinase activity, they do not
require SMAD4 for either colony formation, or for the
response to TGFBR1 inhibition. Signalling via RHOA,
however, rescued the effect of SB-431542 which is both
consistent with our previous analysis of rodent fibroblast
transformation [31], and with a role for TGFβ-activated
non-canonical signalling pathways in this response. The
establishment of an adaptive autocrine TGFβ/TGFBR1
signalling pathway through RHOA following BRAF
mutation may be necessary to overcome CDKN1A
expression and growth arrest induced as a response
to oncogenic stress [31, 42]. Consistent with this are
our data showing CDKN1A induction by disrupting
TGFβ signalling both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure S2). Interestingly, inhibition of

ROCK (using Y27632), a downstream target of RHOA
signalling, also induces CDKN1A in melanoma [43],
and ROCK1 has been identified as a potential candidate
for combinatorial therapy with BRAF inhibitors. In
these studies inhibition of ROCK1 sensitises melanoma
cells to PLX-4720 [44]. Our data now suggest that the
involvement of ROCK1 in resistance mechanisms is
potentially a result of TGFβ/TGFBR1/RHOA signalling.
Although the SMAD-dependent induction of RHO GEFs
has been described in other studies, [45, 46] how TGFBR1
directly activates RHOA in melanoma cells in a SMADindependent manner is unclear at present.
Several other TGFβ target genes have been
implicated in melanoma biological responses. Melanoma
cells exposed to the high levels of exogenous TGFβ
present in bone, upregulate osteolytic genes (including
IL-11, PTHrP, and CTGF) which may aid more effective
colonisation of this metastatic niche. Blocking receptor
function by over-expression of the natural inhibitor
SMAD7 extended survival of mice xenografted with
SMAD7 expressing melanoma cells. However, a causal
role for the TGFβ-regulated osteolytic genes in bone
metastasis was not directly demonstrated [26]. Similarly,
the balance between the TGFβ target gene GLI2 and the
melanocyte specific isoform of MITF (M-MITF) appears
important for invasion through matrigel in vitro, with
high GLI-2/low M-MITF correlating with invasion.
However, these expression profiles were independent of
BRAF mutation status and did not correlate with either
proliferation in vitro or with subcutaneous xenograft
tumour establishment [47]. We suspect that TGFβ target
genes induced by exogenous TGFβ exposure may be quite
different from those genes regulated by non-canonical
signalling as a result of autocrine TGFβ ‘addiction’
established following BRAF mutation. Further work to
identify which are the key TGFβ target genes involved in
both promoting these stem-cell properties, and in driving
drug-resistance, is underway and we expect that these
studies will suggest novel, selective therapeutic targets.
We show that drug-naïve melanoma cells are
growth promoted by low-dose PLX-4720, likely by
paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway. This may
have important implications clinically, since low doses
of bioavailable BRAFi reaching some tumour tissue
could actually potentiate tumour growth. Importantly,
we show that both paradoxically activated, previously
drug naïve cells, as well as vemurafenib resistant cells,
retain sensitivity to TGFBR1 inhibitors. In addition,
SB-431542 prevented phosphorylation of SRC which
is frequently associated with vemurafenib resistance,
suggesting that TGFBR1 inhibitors would prevent relapse
with vemurafenib-resistant metastases. How SB-431542
regulates SRC activation is currently under investigation
in our laboratory. It will be important to test the sensitivity
of BRAFi/MEKi resistant cells derived from patients
treated with combination therapy when established.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Nevertheless, we predict that targeting an independent
signalling pathway may have some advantages over
combination therapies which target different components
of the same signalling pathway. In addition, blocking the
immunosuppressive effects of TGFβ could potentiate the
efficacy of immune based therapeutics. Since dependence
on TGFβ signalling appears to be universal in mutant
BRAF melanoma cells, targeting TGFβ or downstream
effectors may also provide useful therapeutic options for
blocking metastatic outgrowth of vemurafenib refractory
disease which occurs in approximately 20% of patients
receiving treatment. There are currently a number of
TGFβ pathway inhibitors progressing through Phase 1-3
clinical trials [48]. The small molecule TGFBR1 inhibitor
Galunisertib is being evaluated in cancer patients with
unmet need. This inhibitor is deemed tolerable, with an
acceptable margin of safety when administered using
intermittent dosing regimens [49], demonstrating that
TGFBR1 inhibitors are suitable for clinical use and may
provide new opportunities for therapy of BRAF-inhibitor
resistant cancer.

HS_TGFBR1_7 (TGFBR1#2) (Qiagen)] or SMAD4
(Dharmacon smartpool). Mock transfections (no siRNA)
were included in each experiment. A375(M2) pSuper
or pSuper-TGFβ1 stable cell lines were selected and
maintained in 0.6mg/mL puromycin. A375(M2) histone
H2B-RFP stable cell lines were selected and maintained in
800µg/mL G418, and LMP-scrambled or LMP-TGFBR1
shRNA derivatives were maintained in 800µg/mL G418
plus 1µg/mL puromycin. Where indicated the cells were
treated with SB-431542 (Tocris) [50], PLX-4720 (Selleck
Chemicals) or PD184352 (Cell Signalling) (prepared in
DMSO).

Cell proliferation kinetics were either monitored
using an IncuCyte ZoomTM imaging system and
software (percent confluence) (Essen Biosciences), or by
trypsinisation and cell counts using a Casy cell-counter
(model TT, Innovatis).

Colony formation and clonogenicity assays
Colony formation: Cells were seeded in 10cm
dishes at an appropriate density to form approximately
250 discrete colonies after 2-3 weeks in culture. Colonies
were fixed in methanol and stained with toluidine blue/
borax solution for counting.
Clonogenicity: Cells were seeded overnight at
1 and 3 cells/well in 60 wells of a 96-well plate, prior
to treatment. Wells were fed twice weekly, and wells
examined by light microscopy. After approximately two
weeks, media was removed, colonies fixed in methanol
and stained with 0.4% (w/v) sulforhodamineB (SRB)/1%
acetic acid. Colonies > 50 cells in size were counted, and
the plating efficiency and surviving fractions after drug
treatment determined according to Franken et al [35].

TGFβ1 ELISA
The TGFβ1 assay has been described previously
[31]. Briefly, cells were cultured in media containing
0.1% FBS for 24 hours. Media was harvested and the
cells trypsinized and counted. The media was acid treated
to activate latent TGFβ, and TGFβ1 levels determined by
ELISA using anti-TGFβ1 (MAB1835) (capture antibody)
and biotinylated anti-TGFβ1 (BAF240) (detection
antibody). Recombinant hTGFβ1 (Peprotech) was used as
a standard. Results were expressed as TGFβ1 produced
per 1x105 cells/hour.

Soft agar assay
Soft agar assays were carried out essentially as
previously described [31]. Briefly, six well plates were
coated in 2mLs of media supplemented with 0.9% low
melting point agar (Invitrogen). 2mL cells (1x104/mL) in
media supplemented with 0.45% low melting point agar
were overlaid with either SB-431542 or vehicle control.
Wells were fed twice weekly for 2-4 weeks, and the
number of colonies ( > 80μm in diameter) in nine fields of
view was scored using an Olympus CKX41 microscope,
fitted with a 4X objective and an eyepiece graticule
(250μm gradations). Statistical analyses were carried out
by Students TTEST unless stated otherwise.

Mouse xenografts
Nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft experiments
were performed according to Home Office guidelines and
were approved by the local research and ethics committee
(BICRLREC). 1x106 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the flank of CD1 nude mice (n = 8) (Charles Rivers).
Palpable tumours were observed 8 days post-injection
and tumour volumes were calculated using calliper
measurement and the formula V = (E2xA)/2 where E =
shortest and A = the longest diameter measurement.

Immunohistochemistry

Embryos were imaged in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 (Merck,
Amsterdam, Netherlands) using a Leica SP5 STED
confocal microscope (Leica, Rijswijk, Netherlands).
Confocal stacks were processed for maximum intensity
projections with Image J. Images were adjusted for
brightness and contrast, and overlays created using Adobe
Photoshop CS6. Statistical analysis was performed using
Prism 4 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, USA). Results are
expressed as the mean ± SD. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) were performed followed by the Tukey’s
method for multiple comparison. P < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant (*0.01  <  P < 0.05; **0.001 
<  P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001). In one experiment the results
were scored blinded; all results were confirmed by an
independent observer.

Sections from formalin, paraffin embedded,
pSuper (Control shRNA) or pSuper-TGFβ1 shRNA
tumours were stained for CDKN1A (M19, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) using an Envision kit (Dako) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sections were
counter stained with Haemotoxylin and were scored for
CDKN1A expression. One representative field of view
(that contained a minimum of 350 cells) was scored
(blind) for each tumour.

IncuCyte zoom and analysis
An IncuCyte Zoom live cell imaging microscope
(Essen Biosciences) with 10x objective and data
management software was used to monitor kinetic cell
proliferation. The mean ± SEM percent confluence from
four phase-contrast images/well, with a minimum of 3
replicate wells/treatment was determined according to
software processing definitions as recommended by the
manufacturer. Statistical analysis was carried out using
Graphpad software and pairwise comparisons using the
compareGrowthCurves function (statmod, R project,
10,000 permutations).

Embryo preparation and tumor cell implantation
Zebrafish and embryos were raised, staged and
maintained according to standard procedures. The
Institutional Committee for Animal Welfare of the Leiden
University Medical Center (LUMC) approved this study.
Tg(Fli1:GFP) zebrafish embryos were dechorionated at
two days post-fertilisation (dpf). Single cell suspensions
of melanoma cells were prepared in PBS and kept at
4°C before implantation. The cell suspension was loaded
into borosilicate glass capillary needles (1 mm O.D.
× 0.78 mm I.D.; Harvard Apparatus) and the injections
were performed using a Pneumatic Picopump and a
manipulator (World Precision Instruments, Stevenage,
UK). Dechorionated embryos were anaesthetised with
0.003% 3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester [tricaine,
(Sigma)] and mounted on 10 cm Petridishes coated with
1% agarose. Approximately 200 cells were injected at the
duct of Cuvier (DoC). Implanted zebrafish embryos were
maintained at 33°C. Zebrafish in the Non-Silencing (NS)
+ SB431542 group were treated with 1µM SB-431542
added to the eggwater. All implantations were repeated at
least three times with at least 30 embryos per group.
