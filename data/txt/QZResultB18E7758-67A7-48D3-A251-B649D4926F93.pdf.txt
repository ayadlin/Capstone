SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Toward development of a precision medicine framework for metastatic, castration resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC), we established a multi-institutional clinical sequencing infrastructure to
conduct prospective whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of bone or soft tissue tumor
biopsies from a cohort of 150 mCRPC affected individuals. Aberrations of AR, ETS genes, TP53
and PTEN were frequent (40–60% of cases), with TP53 and AR alterations enriched in mCRPC
compared to primary prostate cancer. We identified novel genomic alterations in PIK3CA/B, Rspondin, BRAF/RAF1, APC, β-catenin and ZBTB16/PLZF. Aberrations of BRCA2, BRCA1 and
ATM were observed at substantially higher frequencies (19.3% overall) than seen in primary
prostate cancers. 89% of affected individuals harbored a clinically actionable aberration including
62.7% with aberrations in AR, 65% in other cancer-related genes, and 8% with actionable
pathogenic germline alterations. This cohort study provides evidence that clinical sequencing in
mCRPC is feasible and could impact treatment decisions in significant numbers of affected
individuals.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is among the most common adult malignancies, with an estimated 220,000
US men diagnosed yearly (ACS, 2015). Some men will develop metastatic prostate cancer
and receive primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, nearly all men with
metastatic prostate cancer develop resistance to primary ADT, a state known as metastatic
castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Multiple “second generation” ADT
treatments, like abiraterone acetate (de Bono et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2013) and
enzalutamide (Beer et al., 2014; Scher et al., 2012), have emerged for mCRPC affected
individuals; however, nearly all affected individuals will also develop resistance to these
agents. In the US, an estimated 30,000 men die of prostate cancer yearly.

Author Manuscript

Multiple studies have identified recurrent somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and
oncogenic structural DNA rearrangements (chromoplexy) in primary prostate cancer (Baca
et al., 2013; Barbieri et al., 2012; Berger et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2015; Pflueger et al.,
2011; Taylor et al., 2010; Tomlins et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). These include point
mutations in SPOP, FOXA1, and TP53; copy number alterations involving MYC, RB1,
PTEN, and CHD1; and E26 transformation-specific (ETS) fusions, among other biologically
relevant genes. While certain primary prostate cancer alterations or signatures have
prognostic clinical significance (Hieronymus et al., 2014; Lalonde et al., 2014), the
therapeutic impact of primary prostate cancer genomic events has not yet been realized.

Author Manuscript

Genomic studies of metastatic prostate cancers demonstrated additional alterations in AR
(Taplin et al., 1995) and in the androgen signaling pathway (Beltran et al., 2013; Grasso et
al., 2012; Gundem et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2015), although these studies were performed
predominantly using autopsy samples or preclinical models with limited cohort sizes.
Prospective genomic characterization of fresh biopsy samples from living mCRPC affected
individuals has been limited due to challenges in obtaining adequate tumor tissue, especially
from bone biopsies (Mehra et al., 2011; Van Allen et al., 2014a), which is the most common
site of metastatic disease. Thus, the landscape of genomic alterations in mCRPC disease
remains incompletely characterized. Moreover, the low frequency of actionable genomic
alterations in primary prostate cancer has limited the inclusion of mCRPC among cohorts
wherein precision cancer medicine approaches have been piloted to guide treatment or
clinical trial enrollment.

Author Manuscript

We conducted a systematic and multi-institutional study of mCRPC tumors obtained from
living affected individuals to determine the landscape of somatic genomic alterations in this
cohort, dissect genomic differences between primary prostate cancer and mCRPC, and
discover the potential relevance of these findings from a biological and clinical perspective.

RESULTS
Clinical, biopsy, and pathology parameters
An international consortium consisting of eight academic medical center clinical sites was
established to capture fresh clinical mCRPC affected individual samples as part of standardof-care approaches or through a cohort of prospective clinical trials (Fig. 1A, B). Standard-

of-care approaches for mCRPC included abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Clinical trials
included in this study focused on combination strategies involving abiraterone acetate or
enzalutamide, inhibitors of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), or inhibitors of aurora
kinase. Here we report the results of genomic profiling from mCRPC biopsy samples
obtained at time of entry into the cohort study. Future reports will include longitudinal
clinical data such as treatment response. The consortium utilized two sequencing and
analysis centers, one centralized digital pathology review center, and one centralized data
visualization portal (Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2011;
Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013). Cross-validation of sequencing data from the two original
sequencing sites demonstrated comparable variant calls for adequately powered genetic loci
(Van Allen et al, In preparation).

Author Manuscript

Here we describe 150 affected individuals with metastatic disease with complete integrative
clinical sequencing results (whole exome, matched germline, and transcriptome data) (Fig.
1C), and summarized in Supp. Table S1. One hundred and eighty-nine affected individuals
were enrolled in the study and 175 cases were sequenced after pathology review and
assessment of tumor content. Of these, 150 biopsies had >20% tumor content as defined by
computational analysis, based on mutant allele variant fractions and zygosity shifts. The
biopsies sequenced were from lymph node (42%), bone (28.7%), liver (12.7%) and other
soft tissues (16.7%). Baseline clinical information is available in Supp. Table S2. A majority
of cases (96.4%) displayed typical high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma features while 2.9%
of cases showed neuroendocrine differentiation. One case (0.7%) exhibited small cell
neuroendocrine features (Epstein et al., 2014) (Fig. 1D).
Landscape of mCRPC alterations

Author Manuscript

Somatic aberrations in a panel of 38 statistically or clinically significant genes are illustrated
in Fig. 2. Mean target coverage for tumor exomes was 160X and for matched normal
exomes was 100X. While the average mutation rate for mCRPC was 4.4 mutations/Mb,
there were four cases that exhibited a mutation rate of nearly 50 per Mb, three of which are
likely due to alterations in the mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2 as discussed later.

Author Manuscript

Frequent copy number gains of 8q as well as copy number losses of 8p, 13q, 16q, and 18q
were also observed. The mean number of identified biologically relevant genetic aberrations
per case was 7.8 (Fig. 2). All mutations identified are presented in Supp. Table S3. The
landscape of copy number alterations demonstrated expected recurrent amplification peaks
(frequent AR, 8q gain) and deletion peaks (CHD1, PTEN, RB1, TP53) (Fig. 3A). Additional
frequent focal amplifications were observed in regions encompassing CCND1 and PIK3CA
and PIK3CB. A novel recurrent focal homozygous deletion event was observed in chr11q23,
encompassing the transcriptional repressor ZBTB16.
To identify gene fusions, analysis of 215 transcriptome libraries derived from the 150 tumor
RNAs was performed and identified 4122 chimeras with at least 4 reads spanning the fusion
junction. These fusion junctions resulted from 2247 unique gene pairs, an average of 15
gene fusions per tumor (Supplemental Table S4). Among chimeric fusion transcripts
identified, recurrent ETS fusions (Tomlins et al., 2005) were observed in 84 cases (56%),
with a majority of these fusions to ERG and also novel fusions to FLI1, ETV4, and ETV5

(Fig. 3B). In addition, potential clinically actionable fusions (involving BRAF, RAF1,
PIK3CA/B, or RSPO2) were seen in eight cases (Fig. S1 and covered subsequently).
To place the mCRPC mutation landscape in the context of primary prostate cancer somatic
genomics, we performed a selective enrichment analysis to compare somatic point mutations
and short insertion/deletions observed in this cohort with those observed in somatic whole
exome mutation data from 440 primary prostate cancer exomes (Barbieri et al., 2012)
(TCGA Provisional Data, 2015) (Fig. 3C, Supp. Table S5). Focusing on genes previously
implicated in cancer (n = 550), somatic TP53 mutations were the most selectively mutated
(q < 0.001; Benjamini-Hochberg), followed by AR, KMT2D, APC, BRCA2, and GNAS (q <
0.1; Benjamini-Hochberg; Supp. Table S6). Both AR and GNAS were mutated exclusively in
mCRPC. We found no genes selectively mutated in primary prostate cancer compared to
mCRPC.

We identified an established biological “driver” aberration in a cancer-related gene (i.e.,
known oncogene or tumor suppressor; Supp. Table S7) in nearly all the cases (Fig. 3D).
While 99% of the mCPRC cases harbored a potential driver single nucleotide variant (SNV)
or indel, other classes of driver aberrations were also highly prevalent. These include driver
gene fusions in 60%, driver homozygous deletions in 50% and driver amplifications in 54%.
While informative mutations were present in virtually all mCRPC cases, 63% harbored
aberrations in AR, an expected finding in castrate resistant disease but with higher frequency
than in prior reports (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, even when AR was not considered, 65% of
cases harbored a putatively clinically actionable alteration (defined as predicting response or
resistance to a therapy, having diagnostic or prognostic utility across tumor types) (Supp.
Table S8) (Roychowdhury et al., 2011; Van Allen et al., 2014c). Non-AR related clinically
actionable alterations included aberrations in the PI3K pathway (49%), DNA repair pathway
(19%), RAF kinases (3%), CDK inhibitors (7%) and the WNT pathway (5%). In addition to
somatic alterations, clinically actionable pathogenic germline variants were seen in 8% of
mCRPC affected individuals, potentially emphasizing the need for genetic counseling in
affected individuals with prostate cancer.
Genomically aberrant pathways in mCRPC

Author Manuscript

Integrative analysis using both biological and statistical frameworks (Lawrence et al., 2014;
Lawrence et al., 2013) of somatic point mutations, short insertion/deletions, copy number
alterations, fusion transcripts, and focused germline variant analysis identified discrete
molecular subtypes of mCRPC (Fig. 2). These subtypes were classified based on alteration
clustering and existing biological pathway knowledge, and implicated the AR signaling
pathway, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), WNT, DNA repair, cell
cycle, and chromatin modifier gene sets, among others. The most frequently aberrant genes
in mCRPC included AR (62.7%), ETS family (56.7%), TP53 (53.3%) and PTEN (40.7%)
(Fig. 2).
AR signaling pathway
In aggregate 107/150 (71.3%) of cases harbored AR pathway aberrations, the majority of
which were direct alterations affecting AR through amplification and mutation (Fig. 4A).

Figure 4B summarizes the key genes altered in AR signaling including AR itself, FOXA1 as
a pioneer transcription factor, NCOR1/2 as negative regulators of AR, SPOP as a putative
androgen receptor transcriptional regulator (Geng et al., 2013), and ZBTB16 as an AR
inducible target gene that may also negatively regulate AR. Recurrent hotspot mutations in
AR were observed at residues previously reported to confer agonism to AR antagonists such
as flutamide (T878A) and bicalutamide (W742C), as well as to glucocorticoids (L702H).
Some but not all of these affected individuals had documented prior exposures that could
explain enrichment for these mutations. Additional clinical data collection is ongoing (Fig.
4C). Rare AR mutations not previously described were seen in our cohort, although these are
of unclear functional significance. Furthermore, one affected individual (Case 89) harbored
two putatively functional AR mutations (T878A and Q903H), which may further suggest
intra-tumor heterogeneity emerging in the CRPC setting (Carreira et al., 2014). Analysis of
AR splice variants from RNA-seq data demonstrated a distribution of splice variants
observed throughout these mCRPC tumor cases (Fig. 4D). Analysis of the TCGA prostate
dataset revealed that many of these variants were also present at varying levels in primary
prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue. AR-V7, which has been implicated in abiraterone
acetate and enzalutamide resistance (Antonarakis et al., 2014), was observed in a majority of
pre-abiraterone/enzalutamide cases but at very low ratios relative to full length AR.
Implications for treatment response are unknown at this time.
In addition to AR mutations itself, we observed alterations in AR pathway members (Fig.
4A). These included known alterations in NCOR1, NCOR2, and FOXA1 that have been
previously reported in primary prostate cancers and mCRPC (Barbieri et al., 2012; Grasso et
al., 2012). In this cohort, truncating and missense mutations in FOXA1 form a cluster near
the end of the Forkhead DNA binding domain (Fig. S2).

Author Manuscript

Recurrent homozygous deletions of the androgen-regulated gene ZBTB16 (also known as
PLZF) were seen in 8 (5%) cases (Fig. 4E), not previously reported in clinical mCRPC
biopsies. Analysis of the minimally deleted region seen in this cohort narrowed the
candidate genes in the chr11q23 region to ZBTB16 (Fig. S3). ZBTB16 has been previously
implicated in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and androgen resistance in preclinical models
(Cao et al., 2013; Kikugawa et al., 2006), with loss of ZBTB16 upregulating the MAPK
signaling pathway (Hsieh et al., 2015).
New PI3K pathway discoveries

Author Manuscript

The PI3K pathway was also commonly altered, with somatic alterations in 73/150 (49%) of
mCRPC affected individuals (Fig. 5A). This included biallelic loss of PTEN, as well as
hotspot mutations, amplifications and activating fusions in PIK3CA and p.E17K activating
mutations in AKT1 (Fig. S2). Of note, PIK3CA amplifications resulted in overexpression
compared to the remaining cohort (Fig. S3).
Interestingly, mutations in another member of the PI3K catalytic subunit, PIK3CB, were
observed in this cohort for the first time, at equivalent positions to canonical activating
mutations in PIK3CA (Fig. 5B). PIK3CB mutations appeared in the context of PTEN
deficient cases, consistent with a previous report demonstrating some PTEN deficient
cancers are dependent on PIK3CB, rather than PIK3CA (Wee et al., 2008). Furthermore,

two affected individuals harbored fusions involving PIK3CA/B, with these events resulting
in overexpression of the gene relative to other tumors in the cohort (Fig. 5C–D).
New Wnt pathway discoveries

Author Manuscript

27/150 (18%) of our cases harbored alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 6A).
Hotspot activating mutations in CTNNB1 were seen (Fig. 6B), as previously described
(Voeller et al., 1998). Notably, recurrent alterations in APC were also observed, which have
not been previously described in clinical mCRPC affected individuals. This prompted a
broader examination of Wnt signaling genes (Fig. 6B). Through integrative analysis, we
identified alterations in RNF43 and ZNRF3, which were recently described in colorectal,
endometrial and adrenocortical cancers (Assie et al., 2014; Giannakis et al., 2014) and were
mutually exclusive with APC alterations (Fig. 6A). Moreover, we also discovered R-spondin
fusions involving RSPO2, as previously observed in colorectal carcinoma (Seshagiri et al.,
2012) in association with RSPO2 overexpression in these cases (Fig. 6C). RSPO2 is a key
factor in prostate cancer organoid methodology (Gao et al., 2014). Affected individuals with
aberrations in RNF43, ZNRF3, or RSPO2 (overall 6% of affected individuals) are predicted
to respond to porcupine inhibitors (Liu et al., 2013).
Cell cycle pathway

Author Manuscript

We observed RB1 loss in 21% of cases (Fig. S4). Expanding the scope of cell cycle genes
implicated in mCRPC, we noted focal amplifications involving CCND1 in 9% of cases, as
well as less common (< 5%) events in CDKN2A/B, CDKN1B, and CDK4 (Fig S4). Cell
cycle derangement, such as through CCND1 amplification or CDKN2A/B loss, may result
in enhanced response to CDK4 inhibitors in other tumor types (Finn et al., 2015), and
preclinical mCRPC models predict similar activity in prostate cancer (Comstock et al.,
2013).
DNA Repair pathway

Author Manuscript

Integrative analysis of both the somatic and pathogenic germline alterations in BRCA2
identified 19/150 (12.7%) of cases with loss of BRCA2, of which approximately 90%
exhibited biallelic loss (Fig. 7A). This was commonly a result of somatic point mutation and
loss of heterozygosity, as well as homozygous deletion. One of the clinical trials in our
consortium is evaluating poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in unselected
mCRPC affected individuals. Importantly, multiple affected individuals in this trial who
experienced clinical benefit harbored biallelic BRCA2 loss, providing further evidence of
clinical actionability (Mateo et al., 2014). Eight affected individuals (5.3%) harbored
pathogenic germline BRCA2 mutations (Fig. 7B) with a subsequent somatic event that
resulted in biallelic loss, revealing a surprisingly high frequency relative to primary prostate
cancer.
We therefore expanded the focus to other DNA repair/recombination genes and identified
alterations in at least 34/150 (22.7%) of cases. These include recurrent biallelic loss of ATM
(Fig. 7B), including multiple cases with germline pathogenic alterations. ATM mutations
were also observed inaffected individuals who achieved clinical responses to PARP
inhibition (Mateo et al., 2014). In addition, we noted events in BRCA1, CDK12, FANCA,

RAD51B, and RAD51C. If aberrations of BRCA2, BRCA1 and ATM all confer enhanced
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, 29/150 (19.3%) of mCRPC affected individuals would be
predicted to benefit from this therapy. Interestingly, 3 out of 4 mCRPC tumors exhibited
hypermutation and harbored alterations in the mismatch repair pathway genes MLH1 or
MSH2 (Fig. 2, 7C), corroborating a recent report identifying structural alterations in MSH2
and MSH6 mismatch repair genes in hypermutated prostate cancers (Pritchard et al., 2014).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

To effectively implement precision cancer medicine, prospective identification of predictive
biomarkers should be performed with information derived from the most contemporary
tumor assessments that reflect the affected individual’s prior therapies and treatment
opportunities. In mCRPC, precision cancer medicine activities have been limited by
difficulties obtaining clinical samples from mCRPC affected individuals, and a lack of
comprehensive genomic data for potentially actionable alterations. By demonstrating the
feasibility of prospective genomics in mCRPC and defining the mutational landscape in a
focused metastatic clinical cohort, this report may inform multiple genomically driven
clinical trials, and biological investigations into key mediators of mCRPC. In nearly all of
the mCRPC analyzed in this study, we identified biologically informative alterations; almost
all harbored at least one driver SNV/indel and approximately half harbored a driver gene
fusion, amplification or homozygous deletion. Remarkably, in nearly 90% of mCRPC
affected individuals we identified a potentially actionable somatic or germline event.

Author Manuscript

The high frequency of AR pathway alterations in this cohort strongly implies that the vast
majority of mCRPC affected individuals remain dependent on AR signaling for viability.
Newer “second generation” AR-directed therapies (e.g. abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide)
may select for distinct phenotypes that may be indifferent to AR signaling, and prospective
characterization of such cases will be of particular interest. We hypothesize that affected
individuals with acquired AR mutations, including novel AR mutations discovered in this
cohort, will harbor differential responses to these second-generation ADT therapies. As the
number of affected individuals in this cohort with AR mutations increases, we will
subsequently be able to link specific AR mutations with clinical phenotypes to determine
which mutations confer selective response or resistance to subsequent AR-directed therapy.

Author Manuscript

Moreover, these data identify multiple therapeutic avenues warranting clinical investigation
in the CRPC population. Excluding AR aberrations, 65% of mCRPC have a potentially
actionable aberration that may suggest an investigational drug or approved therapy. For
example, focusing on the PI3K pathway, PIK3CB-specific inhibitors may have utility in
affected individuals with mutation, amplification and/or fusion of this gene (Schwartz et al.,
2015); multiple affected individuals who achieved durable (> 1 year) responses to PIK3CBspecificin inhibition harbored activating mutation or amplification in PIK3CB (de Bono et
al., 2015). RAF kinase fusions in 3% of mCPRC affected individuals would suggest the use
of pan-RAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors (Palanisamy et al., 2010). In addition, the
emergence of porcupine inhibitors (Liu et al., 2013) and R-spondin antibodies may warrant
investigation in mCRPC tumors harboring Wnt pathway alterations or specifically R-

spondin fusions, respectively. These observations will need to be prospectively assessed in
the clinical trials.
Additionally, biallelic inactivation of BRCA2, BRCA1 or ATM was observed in nearly 20%
of affected individuals. Previous work in other cancer types suggest that these affected
individuals may benefit from PARP inhibitors (Fong et al., 2009; Kaufman et al., 2015;
Weston et al., 2010) or platinum based chemotherapy, and prior reports have implicated the
presence of germline BRCA2 alterations in primary prostate cancer with poor survival
outcomes (Castro et al., 2013). Given the incidence of pathogenic germline BRCA2
mutations in this cohort with subsequent somatic events (5%), along with enrichment for
somatic BRCA2 alterations in mCRPC (13%), germline genetic testing in mCRPC affected
individuals warrants clinical consideration.

Author Manuscript

The ability to molecularly characterize mCRPC biopsy samples from affected individuals
actively receiving therapy will also enable focused studies of resistance to secondary ADT
therapies, including neuroendocrine-like phenotypes. This will require iterative sampling of
pre-treatment and resistant tumors from matching affected individuals and may warrant
multiregional biopsies from affected individuals (if feasible) given heterogeneity in mCRPC
(Carreira et al., 2014; Gundem et al., 2015). Towards that end, in some affected individuals
we observed multiple AR mutations emerging in the same biopsy, which may indicate clonal
heterogeneity within these mCRPC tumor samples. Additional genomic alterations
discovered in this cohort (e.g. ZBTB16) warrant exploration in prostate cancer model
systems, including organoid cultures (Gao et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

Broadly, our effort demonstrates the utility of applying comprehensive genomic principles
developed for primary malignancies (e.g., TCGA) to a clinically relevant metastatic tumor
cohort. Our effort may also catalyze multi-institutional efforts to profile tumors from cohorts
of affected individuals with metastatic, treated tumors in other clinical contexts, since our
results demonstrate multiple new discoveries within this advanced disease stage that have
not been observed in primary tumor profiling. Moreover, this study sets the stage for
epigenetic and other profiling efforts in mCRPC not taken in this study, which may enable
biological discovery and have immediate therapeutic relevance in mCRPC (Asangani et al.,
2014). Overall, our efforts demonstrate the feasibility of comprehensive and integrative
genomics on prospective biopsies from individual mCRPC affected individuals to enable
precision cancer medicine activities in this large affected individual population.

METHODS
Author Manuscript

Affected individual enrollment
Affected individuals with clinical evidence of mCRPC who were being considered for
abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide as standard of care, or as part of a clinical trial, were
considered for enrollment. Affected individuals with metastatic disease accessible by imageguided biopsy were eligible for inclusion. All affected individuals provided written informed
consent to obtain fresh tumor biopsies, and to perform comprehensive molecular profiling of
tumor and germline samples.

Biopsies and pathology review

Author Manuscript

Biopsies of soft tissue or bone metastases were obtained under radiographic guidance.
Digital images of biopsy slides were centrally reviewed using schema established to
distinguish usual adenocarcinoma from neuroendocrine prostate cancer (Epstein et al.,
2014). All images were reviewed by genitourinary oncology pathologists (M.R., J.M.M.,
L.P.K., S.A.T., R.M., V.R., A.G., M.L., R.L., M.B.)
Sequencing and Analysis

Author Manuscript

Normal DNAs from buccal swabs, buffy coats, or whole blood were isolated using the
Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit. Flash frozen needle biopsies with highest tumor
content for each case, as determined by pathology review, were extracted for nucleic acids.
Tumor genomic DNA and total RNA were purified from the same sample using the AllPrep
DNA/RNA/miRNA kit (QIAGEN) with disruption on a Tissuelyser II (Qiagen). RNA
integrity was verified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using RNA Nano reagents (Agilent
Technologies).

Author Manuscript

Whole exome capture libraries were constructed from 100ng to 1 µg of DNA from tumor
and normal tissue after sample shearing, end repair, and phosphorylation and ligation to
barcoded sequencing adaptors. Ligated DNA was size selected for lengths between 200–350
bp and subjected to hybrid capture using SureSelect Exome v4 baits (Agilent). Exome
sequence data processing and analysis were performed using pipelines at the Broad Institute
and the University of Michigan. A BAM file aligned to the hg19 human genome build was
produced using Illumina sequencing reads for the tumor and normal sample and the Picard
pipeline. Somatic mutation analysis was performed as described previously (Cibulskis et al.,
2013; Van Allen et al., 2014c) and reviewed with Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV)
(Robinson et al., 2011).
Copy number aberrations were quantified and reported for each gene as the segmented
normalized log2-transformed exon coverage ratios between each tumor sample and matched
normal sample (Lonigro et al., 2011). To account for observed associations between
coverage ratios and GC content across the genome, lowess normalization was used to
correct per-exon coverage ratios prior to segmentation analysis. Mean GC percentage was
computed for each targeted region, and a lowess curve was fit to the scatterplot of log2coverage ratios vs. mean GC content across the targeted exome using the lowess function in
R (version 2.13.1) with smoothing parameter f=0.05. The resulting copy ratios were
segmented using the circular binary segmentation algorithm (Olshen et al., 2004).

Statistical analysis of recurrently mutated genes was performed using MutSig (Lawrence et
al., 2013). Selective enrichment analysis (Van Allen et al., 2014b) of mutations observed in
mCRPC compared to primary prostate cancer was performed by tabulating the frequency
affected individual-normalized mutations observed in either CRPC or primary prostate
cancer and performing a two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test using allelic fraction cut off of 0.1 or
greater and a set of biologically relevant cancer genes (n = 550 genes) (Futreal et al., 2004).
Multiple hypothesis test correction was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg method.

Transcriptome libraries were prepared using 200–1000 ng of total RNA. PolyA+ RNA
isolation, cDNA synthesis, end-repair, A-base addition, and ligation of the Illumina indexed
adapters were performed according to the TruSeq RNA protocol (Illumina). Libraries were
size-selected for 250–300 bp cDNA fragments on a 3% Nusieve 3:1 (Lonza) gel, recovered
using QIAEX II reagents (Qiagen), and PCR-amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase
(New England Biolabs). Total transcriptome libraries were prepared as above, omitting the
poly A selection step and captured using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V4 reagents
and protocols. Library quality was measured on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer for product
size and concentration. Paired-end libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2500,
(2×100 nucleotide read length), with sequence coverage to 50M paired reads and 100M total
reads

Author Manuscript

Paired-end transcriptome sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome
(GRCh37/hg19) using a RNA-Seq spliced read mapper Tophat2(Kim and Salzberg, 2011)
(Tophat 2.0.4), with ‘--fusion-search’ option turned on to detect potential gene fusion
transcripts. Potential false positive fusion candidates were filtered out using ‘Tophat-PostFusion’ module. Further, the fusion candidates were manually examined for annotation and
ligation artifacts. Gene expression, as fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments
mapped (FPKM; normalized measure of gene expression), was calculated using Cufflinks
(Trapnell et al., 2012).
