BACKGROUND: The primary goal of this trial was to evaluate the confirmed response rate of temsirolimus (CCI-779),
a mammalian target of rapamycin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS). METHODS: Patients 18
years with measurable advanced STS, no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (adjuvant and neoadjuvant
chemotherapy allowed), adequate organ function, and performance status of 2 were eligible. After premedication
with an antihistamine, CCI-779 was given intravenously at 25 mg over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, repeated
every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.
RESULTS: Between June 2004 and November 2005, a total of 41 patients were enrolled and began treatment; 40
patients are evaluable for response and adverse events. The median age was 62 years (range, 28-72 years) with 56%
women. Eighty percent had high-grade STS, and 22% had prior adjuvant chemotherapy. There were 2 patients (5%;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1-17) (undifferentiated fibrosarcoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma) who achieved a
confirmed partial response lasting 3 and 17 months, respectively. Thirty-nine (95%) patients have progressed, with
a median time to progression of 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.5). The median overall survival was 7.6 months (95%
CI, 6.1-15.9). Forty-three percent experienced grade 3þ adverse events that were possibly related to therapy.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of cancers with various biologic activities. It is estimated that there

will be 10,520 new cases of STS diagnosed in 2010, with an estimated mortality of 37%.1 Despite activity of certain agents
for histologic-specific STS such as of imatinib and sunitinib for gastrointestinal stromal sarcomas2,3 or gemcitabine and
docetaxel for uterine leiomyosarcoma,4 for the vast majority of the other STS, treatment with palliative doxorubicin- or
ifosfamide-based therapy is toxic and has marginal activity.5,6
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates numerous cellular functions.
mTOR functions within 2 distinct signaling complexes, denoted as mTOR complex 1 (mTOR complex 1) and mTOR
complex 2. In the presence of adequate nutrient and energy stores, mTOR complex 1 integrates signals from mitogenic
signaling pathways and controls downstream signaling cascades that regulate translation of a subset of mRNAs with complex 50 untranslated regions or 50 polypyrimidine tracts. Many of these transcripts encode proteins involved in promoting
cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell survival. Key downstream targets that modulate protein translation include eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and p70S6 kinase, the latter of which phosphorylates ribosomal S6 protein.7 Several potent
inhibitors of mTOR complex 1 signaling have been developed, including sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune) and the
related ester temsirolimus (CCI-779, sirolimus 42-ester with 2,2-bis[hydroxymethyl] propionic-acid). CCI-779

inhibition has growth inhibitory effects on a wide range of
histologically diverse tumor cells, including STS.8,9 The
primary goal of this phase 2 study was to determine confirmed response rate of CCI-779 in STS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients with histologically confirmed STS were eligible
for the study. Patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2, and life
expectancies of 12 weeks. The inclusion criteria
included: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1500/
mm3, platelet count 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin 10.0
g/dL, direct bilirubin 1.5 the institutional upper limit
of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase 2.5 the
institutional ULN or5 the ULN if there were liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase 2.5 ULN or5
the ULN if there were liver metastases, creatinine 1.5
the institutional ULN (or creatinine clearance 50mL/
min for patients with creatinine levels >1.5 institutional
ULN), fasting serum cholesterol 350 mg/dL, fasting triglycerides 400 mg/dL, age 18 years, and negative
pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. All
patients were required to have at least 1 lesion that could
be accurately measured, with the longest diameter measuring 2.0 cm. Exclusion criteria included: chemotherapy for metastatic disease (exceptions: patients with
gastrointestinal stromal tumors [GIST] who fail Gleevec
are eligible; patients who have had adjuvant/neoadjuvant
chemotherapy are also eligible), pregnancy or lactation,
uncontrolled intercurrent illness, central nervous system
metastases unless treated and stable symptoms for 1
month, history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds similar to temsirolimus (CCI779), and known
human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy.
Treatment Administration and Evaluation
CCI-779 was administered intravenously at 25 mg over
30 minutes on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, repeated every 4
weeks. Premedication with antihistamines was given
intravenously 30 minutes before CCI-779. Doses were
held for grade 3-4 hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities. Treatment was resumed at 5 mg dose reduction
once the nonhematologic toxicity resolved to grade 2,
ANC 1000/mm3, and platelets 75,000/mm3. A maximum of 3 dose modifications were allowed.

Baseline evaluations were done within 7 days of
treatment, including history and physical, complete blood
count (CBC), albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatinine,
glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphorus, potassium,
total protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, sodium, total and direct bilirubin, cholesterol,
triglycerides, and pregnancy test. CBC were done weekly
before treatment in addition to chemistry, cholesterol,
and triglycerides done every other week. Adverse events
were collected via National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Pretreatment and post-treatment blood samples were processed to evaluate sirolimus blood levels and S6
phosphorylation to document inhibition of mTOR complex 1 signaling.
The study was approved by the institutional review
board at each treating site. Toxicity stopping rules were in
place. Specifically, if at any time 4 of the initial 20 patients
or 20% of all patients experienced a grade 4 or 5 adverse
event (at least possibly related to study treatment), then
accrual to the study would have been halted for full review
of the data by the study team.
Disease Assessment
Disease assessment by computed tomography scan or
magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 21
days of registration. Tumor evaluations were done after 2
cycles of therapy and then every other cycle (ie, every 8
weeks). Tumor response was assessed using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), with reevaluation every 8 weeks.10 Total disappearance of target
lesions constituted a complete response (CR), whereas a
minimum of a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions was classified as a partial
response (PR). New lesions or a 20% increase in the sum
of the longest diameters of the target lesions were considered progressive disease (PD). Patients were re-evaluated
for disease status 4 weeks after initial documentation of
CR or PR to confirm the assessment. Similarly, stable disease (SD) was reassessed at a minimum interval of 8
weeks. Patients with global deterioration of health status
requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective
evidence of disease progression at that time, and not
related to study treatment or other medical conditions,
were considered to have PD because of symptomatic
deterioration.
Duration of response was calculated from the first
date of a patient’s objective status of either CR or PR to

3469

the date of PD (or last tumor assessment). Duration of
SD was calculated from the date of registration to the date
of PD (or last tumor assessment if no PD) for patients
having achieved a best response of SD. Patients were censored for progression (survival) at their date of last assessment (last contact) if no progression (death) occurred.
Time to PD was calculated from the date of registration to
the date of PD. Survival or time to death was calculated
from the date of registration to the date of death. All
patients were followed until death or a maximum of 5
years after registration, whichever was earlier.
Laboratory Correlative Studies
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood samples obtained before and 24 hours
after the first infusion of CCI-779. Samples were processed as described in detail previously.11 Briefly, fresh
PBMC were divided into aliquots, spiked with or without
rapamycin, and then stimulated with phytohemagglutinin
and phorbol 12-myristate 14-acetate before freezing. Frozen samples then were batch processed for Western blotting with phospho- and total-S6 antibodies. NIH Image J
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) was used to measure optical
density of individual bands, and the ratio of phospho-S6
versus total S6 was calculated for each sample. The difference in the phospho-S6 intensity between the spiked and
unspiked pretreatment blood sample was considered the
dynamic range of S6 phosphorylation with and without
effective mTOR complex 1 inhibition, respectively, and a
75% or greater reduction in this dynamic range in the
post-treatment blood sample was considered effective inhibition of S6 phosphorylation. Blood samples for sirolimus serum levels 24 hours after treatment were
determined in the Mayo Medical Laboratories.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint for this trial was the proportion of
confirmed tumor responses. All eligible patients who have
initiated study treatment and signed consent were considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. Confirmed tumor response to treatment is defined as a CR or PR on 2
consecutive evaluations, at least 4 weeks apart. The primary endpoint was estimated by the number of confirmed
responses divided by the total number of evaluable
patients. Five percent was the threshold used for clinical
inactivity (Ho) in regard to confirmed tumor response
rate, whereas an observed confirmed response rate of 20%
was considered promising (Ha) in this population. To test
these hypotheses and in recognition of the lack of benefi-

3470

cial treatments in this population, a single-stage phase 2
study design with a planned interim analysis was used; no
suspension of accrual between stages was allowed unless
there was excessive toxicity. Here, 2 confirmed responses
within the initial 20 patients expanded enrollment to 50
patients. Six of 50 patients with confirmed tumor
responses was considered evidence that this treatment
could be recommended for further testing in subsequent
studies in this patient population. This single-stage Fleming design12 yielded 91% power to detect a true confirmed response rate of at least 20%, at a .09 level of
significance. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary
endpoint were calculated by the method of Duffy and
Santner.13
Summary statistics and frequency tables were used
to summarize baseline patient characteristics and adverse
events. Adverse events were reported as a maximum severity per patient and type, across all cycles of treatment. All
attributions collected for adverse events were reported
unless otherwise noted. The Kaplan-Meier14 method was
used to estimate distributions of time to progression and
time to death. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Laboratory correlatives were investigated using
graphical techniques and summary statistics (eg, mean,
median). Serum sirolimus was measured post-treatment
only, whereas all other correlates were measured at both
pretreatment and post-treatment. Changes over time were
assessed using percentage change from baseline, as well as
categorical methods (eg, using frequency tables to identify
changes in the patterns of phosphorylation intensity).
Clinical characteristics (eg, sex, age) and patient outcome
(eg, progression, death, response) were assessed relative to
laboratory correlatives to look for possible associations (or
lack thereof). These analyses were considered hypothesis
generating in nature.

with lung metastases. Eighty percent had high-grade STS
based on local pathology review.
Treatment Efficacy
Forty (98%) of 41 patients were considered evaluable for the
primary endpoint of confirmed tumor response. Accrual was
rapid, and at the time response data were available for the
first 20 evaluable patients, only 1 patient achieved a confirmed PR. This failed to meet the criteria to complete full
accrual of 50 patients; thus, the trial was closed at Patient 41.
Overall, 2 (5%; 95% CI, 1-17) patients achieved a confirmed PR (Table 2). A 63-year-old man, with undifferentiated fibrosarcoma of the thigh and metastases to the lung,
achieved a PR after 2 cycles of therapy, which was sustained
for 17 months until progression in the lung at Cycle 19. He
died 10 months later of his cancer. The other PR was a 42year-old woman, with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus and metastases in the lymph nodes, bone, and lung, achieved a PR
in Cycle 4. She had progression in the lymph nodes and lung
in Cycle 7 (duration of response, 3 months). She died 22
months later of her cancer.
Thirty-nine (95%) patients progressed; the most
common site of progression was the lung (58%). Figure 1
and Table 2 indicate time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS), as well as duration of response. The median time to progression was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.83.5). All patients have died. The median time to death
(OS) was 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.1-15.9).
Tolerability
Forty-one patients completed a total of 143 cycles of treatment (median, 2; range, 1-19). Nine patients had dose

reductions in 9 cycles for nonhematologic (6 patients) and
hematologic (3 patients) toxicities. CCI-779 was held in
19 patients (Day 8, 9 patients; Day 15, 9 patients; Day
22, 18 patients). Table 3 describes the number of doses
omitted per cycle. All patients have completed study treatment. Reasons for discontinuing treatment include: disease progression (85%); adverse event (7%); refusal (3%),
and surgical debulking (3%).
Toxicity
Table 4 describes the maximum severity of treatmentrelated adverse events. Forty-three percent experienced
grade 3þ adverse events at least possibly related to treatment during all cycles of therapy. The most common toxicities (adverse events at least possibly related to
treatment) included (number of patients with grade 3-4):
stomatitis (n ¼ 3), fatigue (n ¼ 2), and anemia (n ¼ 1).
Two patients experienced grade 4 adverse events; these
included hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, and peripheral
motor neuropathy.
Translational Correlates
Sample collection was optional for this study. Samples for
sirolimus testing were available for 23 patients; samples
for PBMC testing were available for 37 patients. Sirolimus is the active metabolite of temsirolimus, and as
related in Table 5, 23 patients had sirolimus levels ranging
from 23.9 to 171 ng/mL, with a median serum level of
51.8 ng/mL (Fig. 2). Although the limited pharmacokinetic sampling limits the interpretation of the drug-level
data, the therapeutic range for effective mTOR complex 1
suppression in the transplant setting is trough levels of 4
to 12 ng/mL sirolimus, and thus, all patients had drug

levels above this range 24 hours after the first infusion of
CCI-779. Inhibition of mTOR complex 1 signaling was
assessed in PBMC samples by comparing phosphorylation levels of ribosomal protein S6 in pretreatment and
post-treatment PBMC. Pretreatment and post-treatment
blood samples were available from 32 of 37 patients and
were processed in this assay. Of these 32, results from 10
patients were inconclusive (no P-S6 and/or total S6 signal
for at least 1 sample), 1 patient’s samples were insensitive
to the rapamycin spike, and 1 patient had equivocal
results. Of the remaining 20 interpretable paired patient
samples, 16 (80%) of 20 patients had robust suppression
of S6 phosphorylation exceeding a 75% reduction in
PBMC P-S6 signal. Thus, potentially therapeutic drug
levels were achieved in all patients, and mTOR signaling
in PBMC was effectively suppressed in approximately 2=3
of patients. Both sirolimus and PBMC samples were available for 18 patients. Patients experiencing robust suppression of S6 phosphorylation (median, 50.6; range, 23.9171) did not have significantly different sirolimus values
from those who did not (median, 62.9; range, 41.5-76.4;
Wilcoxon rank sum test P ¼ .71). In addition, the patient
having a 17-month duration of response demonstrated PS6 inhibition, showing a 75% drop at 24 hours. The other
patient having a 3-month response showed only a 36%
drop at 24 hours (ie, no P-S6 inhibition).

DISCUSSION
This phase 2 study of CCI-779 demonstrated possible activity in fibrosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, but showed
no activity in the other histologies of STS treated in our
study. grade 3þ toxicities related to therapy occurred in
43% of patients. The most common grade 3þ symptom
possibly related to therapy was stomatitis, which occurred
in 3 patients, followed by fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and
dyspnea, which each occurred in 2 patients. This toxicity

has been tailored more to the histological subtype of sarcoma rather than broad-based chemotherapy. For
instance, histology-specific options are available for GIST
with imatinib and sunitinib2,3; for uterine leiomyosarcoma with docetaxel and gemcitabine4 as well as dacarba-

with single-agent doxorubicin or combination with ifosfamide is still the standard chemotherapy option.
mTOR inhibition is an attractive target for cancer
and especially for STS, as many of the signal transduction
networks in STS are affected by mTOR. In our study, we
tested CCI-779 in a broad variety of STS in the first-line
metastatic setting. We chose to use standard confirmed
response rate by RECIST as our primary endpoint. Other
endpoints such Choi criteria25 and progression-free survival26 were just being developed during the inception of
this trial. Moreover, Choi criteria were developed for
GIST and have not been validated in all STS.25 We also
performed ancillary testing to confirm that we were
obtaining inhibition of mTOR signaling.
Although CCI-779 was overall well tolerated, we
only had 2 (5%) confirmed responses, with a response duration of 3 and 17 months. The median TTP was short at
2 months, and the median OS was 7.6 months. Inhibition
of pS6 was achieved in 80% of the cases, and therapeutic
levels of sirolimus were seen all cases tested. The relationship between TTP with the inhibition of pS6 and sirolimus was explored; results were not significant. According
to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, progression-free rates for first-line therapy at 6 months of 30% to 56% would suggest an active
compound. Our 6-month progression-free rate of 13%
would suggest that CCI-779 is not an active agent.
Our patient population would be considered a standard
STS cohort. They had a good ECOG PS (85% with a PS of
0 or 1), had mainly lung metastasis (72%), had high-grade
STS (80%), had common histologies of malignant fibrous
histiocytoma (pleomorphic sarcoma), liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and sarcoma not otherwise specified along with
some less common histologies, and received the planned targeted dose of therapy (CCI-779 >80% of the time).
The use of CCI-779 in the first-line setting is not justified based on this study. However, further study in fibrosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma histologies could be
considered, given the PRs observed in our study. It is
unknown what role the other mTOR inhibitors have in
STS or what role the mTOR inhibitors have in maintaining
response rates, and results from ongoing studies are awaited.
