Abstract
The enhancement of immune effector functions has been proposed as a potential strategy for increasing the
efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. Here, we show that removing fucose from trastuzumab (Herceptin) increased its binding to FcγRIIIa, enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and more than
doubled the median progression-free survival when compared with conventional trastuzumab in treating preclinical models of HER2-amplified breast cancer. Our results show that afucosylated trastuzumab has superior
efficacy in treating in vivo models of HER2-amplified breast cancer and support the development of effector
function–enhanced antibodies for solid tumor therapy. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4481–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a humanized antibody for
treating HER2/ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Trastuzumab was initially approved for the treatment of women
with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in combination
with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy (1) and as a monotherapy (2, 3). Multiple studies have been completed in
several large adjuvant or early breast cancer trials for
HER2-positive breast cancer (4). A survival benefit was noted
after only 2 years of follow-up, which is impressive in breast
cancer (4). Multiple mechanisms of action are thought to
contribute to the tumor-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab.
Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 has a direct inhibitory
effect on HER2-amplified tumor cells. Trastuzumab disrupts
the ligand-independent HER2-HER3 interaction resulting in
rapid inhibition of HER3/PI3K/AKT signaling (5). Ultimately,
this leads to an increase in the CDK2 inhibitor, p27, resulting
in cell cycle arrest of the cancer cells (5–8). Another primary
effect on tumor cells is the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit
HER2 ectodomain shedding (9), which may have therapeutic
significance. Trastuzumab is also known to have synergistic
effects when combined with chemotherapy (10).
In addition to directly inhibiting tumor cell signaling, trastuzumab can also mediate the effector functions of immune
cells through the constant region (Fc) of the antibody. As a
humanized IgG1, it binds to Fcγ receptor III (RIII) and is a

potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The ability of trastuzumab to mediate
ADCC is strictly related to HER2 density (11). Tumor cells
that overexpress HER2 are observed to have 100-fold more
HER2 on their cell surface than normal adjacent breast epithelial cells (12). As a result, trastuzumab mediates ADCC
very effectively against target cell lines that overexpress
HER2 but displays only background activity against cells that
express normal levels of HER2. Depleting trastuzumab
effector functions by Fc modification or deleting the FcγR
functions from the mouse results in significant reduction
of trastuzumab efficacy, demonstrating the importance of
immune effector functions in trastuzumab response (13).
Clinical relevance for effector functions of Herceptin is
supported by a report demonstrating that trastuzumab efficacy correlated with the high-affinity FcγRIII genotype (V/V;
ref. 14) similar to rituximab-treated patients (15). Furthermore, increased tumor-associated natural killer (NK) cells
and lytic capacity of effector cells were detected after trastuzumab treatment (16–18), and trastuzumab response correlated with high in vitro ADCC (17, 18) and immune cell
infiltration (17).
Together, the aforementioned studies provide a biological
and clinical rationale for a strategy in which increasing
trastuzumab-FcγRIIIa affinity could enhance therapeutic
benefit. Currently, no published reports have shown that
enhancing FcγR affinity results in enhanced in vivo efficacy
for the treatment of established, nonhematologic tumors.
Although promising results are described in a few published
reports in which treatment commenced at the same time as
tumor cell inoculation (13, 19, 20), these studies leave open
the question of whether the observed outcomes were due to
the effects on tumor implantation. The primary aim of the
present study is to determine whether the efficacy of trastuzumab in suppressing the growth of established tumors is
augmented by increasing FcγR binding affinity.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Breast cancer cell line BT-474-M1 is an in vivo–passaged
subclone of BT-474 (American Type Culture Collection;
ref. 13). MCF7-neo/HER2 cells were established at Genentech, Inc. KPL-4 breast cancer cells were obtained from
J. Kurebayashi (Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery,
Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan;
ref. 21). SKBR-3 and MCF-10A cells were from American Type
Culture Collection. Cell lines were maintained in high-glucose
DMEM/Ham's F-12 (50:50) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine.
Analysis of N-linked oligosaccharides
The oligosaccharide profiles of the antibodies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization timeof-flight mass spectrometry, as previously described (22).
Fcγ receptor binding ELISA
Soluble human FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, FcγRIIIA(F158),
and FcγRIIIA(V158) (ref. 23), and mouse FcγRI, FcγRII,
and FcγRIIIA (Genentech) were expressed in Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells (mFcγRI and mFcγRII in 293
cells) as recombinant fusion proteins with Gly-His6–glutathione S-transferase at the COOH terminus of the extracellular domain of the receptor α chains. Soluble mouse
FcγRIV was expressed in CHO cells as a recombinant fusion protein with Gly-His8 at the COOH terminus of the extracellular domain of the receptor α chains (Genentech).
MaxiSorp 384-well microwell plates (Nunc) were coated
with 2 μg/mL of anti–glutathione S-transferase (clone
8E2.1.1; Genentech) or anti-His (penta his antibody, for
mouse FcγRIV; Qiagen) in 50 mmol/L of carbonate buffer
(pH 9.6), at 4°C overnight followed by a wash (PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate; pH 7.4). Plates were blocked for
1 hour in room temperature with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and washed. Fcγ receptor [0.25
μg/mL, in PBS containing 0.5% BSA, and 0.05% polysorbate
20 (pH 7.4) in assay buffer] was incubated in plates for
1 hour followed by a wash. To measure binding to the
high-affinity FcγRI, IgG antibodies (0.0085–500 ng/mL in
3-fold serial dilution) in assay buffer were added to the
plates. To measure binding to the low-affinity FcγRII,
FcγIII, and FcγRIV, IgG antibodies were first incubated
with goat F(ab′)2 anti-κ antibody (MP Biomedicals) at a
1:2 (w/w) ratio for 1 hour to form antibody complexes.
Complexed IgG antibodies (0.42–25,000 ng/mL in 3-fold serial dilution) in assay buffer were added to the plates, incubated for 2 hours, and washed. Bound IgG was detected
after 1 hour of incubation with peroxidase-labeled goat F
(ab′)2 anti-human IgG F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
in assay buffer followed by a wash, incubation with substrate (3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine; Kirkegaard & Perry
Laboratories), and termination with 1 mol/L of phosphoric
acid. The absorbance (450 nm) at the midpoint of the standard curve (mid-OD) was calculated. The corresponding
concentrations of standard and samples at this mid-OD

4482

were determined from the titration curves using a fourparameter nonlinear regression curve-fitting program (XLfit).
In vitro ADCC
In vitro ADCC assays were performed as previously described (24). In short, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were separated from the blood of normal volunteers
using lymphocyte separation medium (MP Biomedicals). The
NK cells were enriched from the PBMCs using anti-CD56
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Target cells (1 × 104) were preincubated with antibodies for 30 minutes in 37°C in serumfree RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% BSA before adding
the effector cells in a 25:1 E/T ratio (10:1 when NKs were
used as effectors). The cells were incubated for an additional
4 hours before detecting death by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase activity from the medium using Cytotoxicity
Detection Kit (LDH; Roche). All measurements were done
in quadruplicate. The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated as follows: % cytotoxicity (experimental lysis − spontaneous
effector lysis − spontaneous target lysis) / (maximum target
lysis − spontaneous target lysis) × 100.
HER2 binding
Nunc BreakApart Immunomodule plates (Nunc) were coated with 20 ng/mL of HER2-ECD-Ig fusion protein in 50 mmol/L
of HEPES (pH 8.2), and 150 mmol/L of NaCl overnight at
4°C. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 2 mg/mL of BSA,
25 mmol/L of Tris (pH 7.5), and 150 mmol/L of NaCl for
2 hours at room temperature. Wells were washed thrice with
assay buffer [2 mg/mL BSA and 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.2)
in RPMI]. The competitive binding reaction with a dilution
series of nonlabeled competitor antibodies and constant
125
I-trastuzumab was carried out for 2 hours at room temperature. The 125I-trastuzumab bound to HER-2 was then detected by a gamma counter and the data were analyzed
using the nonlinear regression method of Munson and
Rodbard (25). All measurements were done in quadruplicate.
Analysis of PI3K/AKT pathway activation
Cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with nondenaturing
lysis buffer including 1% Triton (Cell Signaling Technology).
Lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation.
AKT phosphorylation was detected by ELISA detecting phosphorylated Ser473 (Cell Signaling Technology).
Cell proliferation
Proliferation/viability of cells was detected using CellTiterGlo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). For the
assay, 5 × 103 cells were plated on 96-well plates and incubated overnight for cell attachment before 6 days of
treatment with the antibodies. All measurements were
done in triplicate.
Mice
Rag2−/− (BALB/c; Taconic) mice were crossbred to FcγRI/
−/−
III (CD64/CD16 double KO, BALB/c, kindly provided by
S. Verbeek; refs. 26, 27), resulting in FcγRI/III/Rag2−/− mice,
which were then crossbred to human FcγRIIIa transgenic

Pharmacokinetic studies
Pharmacokinetic studies were performed as previously
described (29). In short, a single i.v. 10 mg/kg dose of
trastuzumab or afucosylated trastuzumab was injected to
FcγRI−/−FcγRIII−/−RAG2−/−Tg (human FcγRIIIa) mice. Serum
samples (n = 4/time point) were collected by retro-orbital
bleed or cardiac stick after administration of the antibodies
(time points: 3 minutes, 1 and 5 hours, and 1, 3, 7, 14, and
28 days). Samples were assayed for trastuzumab by HER2
binding ELISA (29), in which a HER2 extracellular domain coated to a microtiter plate was used to capture the humanized
anti-HER2 antibodies in circulation. Time concentration data
were analyzed using compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis
(Model 8, WinNonlin-Pro v3.2; Pharsight Corporation).

In vivo drug efficacy
To address the requirement of FcγR interaction in the
trastuzumab response using T-D265A, SCID-beige mice
(Charles River Labs) were used. For afucosylated trastuzumab efficacy studies, FcγRI−/−FcγRIII−/−RAG2−/−Tg (human
FcγRIIIa) mice were used. Mice xenografted with MCF7-neo/
HER2 cells were supplemented with subcutaneous estrogen
pellets (0.36 mg, 60-day release; Innovative Research of
America) 3 days prior to cell inoculation. Five million
MCF7-neo/HER2 cells or 3 million KPL-4 cells were injected
into the mammary fat pad in a 1:1 HBSS-matrigel suspension (BD Matrigel, BD Biosystems). When tumor volumes
reached 100 to 300 mm3, mice were randomly grouped into
treatment cohorts. Dosing is described in the figure legends.
Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: (mm3) =

Results
Afucosylated trastuzumab has increased affinity to
human FcγRIIIa which results in enhanced ADCC
We produced 100% fucose-free (afucosylated trastuzumab)
trastuzumab in FUT8−/− CHO cells (30). The FUT8 gene encodes 1,6-fucosyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of
fucose from GDP-fucose to N-acetylglucosamine. The oligosaccharide profile of the antibodies was determined by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
analysis, which confirmed the lack of fucose (Table 1). The
relative affinity of afucosylated trastuzumab was analyzed
by FcγR binding ELISA. Binding to FcγRIIIa-F158 and
FcγRIIIa-V158 increased by 29-fold and 6.5-fold, respectively
(Table 2). Binding to human FcγRI, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIb
was not markedly altered, indicating that afucosylated
trastuzumab has selective enhanced affinity for FcγRIII
(Table 2). Similarly, binding to mouse FcγRI, FcγRII, or
FcγRIII was not increased and only a minor increase was
detected in relative affinity to FcγRIV (Table 2). The
increases in binding affinity to mFcγRIV and huFcγRIIIaV158 were similar (3.3- and 6.2-fold decreased KD, respectively; data not shown) when binding was measured using
surface plasmon resonance–based technology (Biacore).

Afucosylated trastuzumab showed increased in vitro
ADCC. The ability to mediate ADCC improved 1.9- to 7.2-fold
(EC50; n = 5) when F/F effectors were used and 2.1- to 7.7-fold
(n = 5) when V/V donors were used (Fig. 1A; data not shown).
A representative experiment using F/F effector cells is presented in Fig. 1A. ADCC activity increase was statistically significant in 0.01 to 0.1 ng/mL antibody doses (Fig. 1A; t test).
Despite the effector cell donor–dependent variability, the
EC50 was consistently lower for afucosylated trastuzumab
in each assay. ADCC activity of PBMCs was mediated by
NK cells (Fig. 1A). When purified NK cells from F/F donors
were used as effector cells, an 11.3-fold enhancement in
ADCC was observed for afucosylated trastuzumab (Fig. 1A).
Afucosylated trastuzumab did not mediate ADCC of MCF10A cells which express low/normal levels of HER2 even at
high antibody concentrations and using V/V effectors cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Together, these results show that
afucosylated trastuzumab has increased affinity for human
FcγRIIIa, which results in enhanced ADCC.
Afucosylated trastuzumab retains FcγR-independent
functions of trastuzumab
In addition to the ability to mediate ADCC, trastuzumab
has a direct effect on tumor cell signaling which causes cell

(black symbols) and afucosylated trastuzumab (red symbols) to mediate in vitro ADCC by FcγRIIIa-F158 homozygous PBMCs (left), NK cells or NK
cell–depleted PBMCs (right) was measured using assay detecting LDH released from lysed cells. HER2-amplified BT474-M1 cells were used as target cells
in a 25:1 effector/target ratio (10:1 when NK cells were used as effectors). B to D, removal of fucose does not affect FcγR-independent properties of
trastuzumab. B, binding to recombinant extracellular domain of human HER2 was determined by competition binding of 125I-trastuzumab with nonlabeled
trastuzumab or afucosylated trastuzumab. C, HER2-amplified SKBR-3 cells were treated for 1 h with antibodies (10 μg/mL) or Wortmannin (1 μmol/L).
AKT phosphorylation was measured by ELISA detecting phosphorylated Ser473. Statistical significance between groups was determined using
Dunnett's test. D, proliferation of SKBR-3 cells was analyzed after 6 days of treatment with trastuzumab or afucosylated trastuzumab using
CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay.

cycle arrest and inhibition of proliferation. To confirm that
carbohydrate modification does not affect HER2 binding,
we competed the binding of radioiodinated trastuzumab to
HER2 ECD by adding increasing concentrations of noniodinated antibody (trastuzumab or afucosylated trastuzumab)
in the reaction (Fig. 1B). The calculated affinities of antibodies
were similar for trastuzumab and afucosylated trastuzumab
(KD, 0.13 ± 0.04 and 0.12 ± 0.03 nmol/L, respectively), indicating that lack of fucose does not affect HER2 binding.
To explore the antisignaling properties, SKBR-3 cells were
treated with trastuzumab or the afucosylated variant.
Treatment with 10 μg/mL of trastuzumab or afucosylated trastuzumab caused a 69% to 66% reduction in pAKT after 60 minutes of treatment (Fig. 1C). No difference was detected in the
effects of afucosylated and conventional trastuzumab treatment (P = 0.99; Dunnetts'). SKBR-3 proliferation was measured
after 6 days of treatment. Both antibodies caused approximately 50% maximal reduction in proliferation (Fig. 1D). The EC50
values were 52 ± 8 and 61 ± 9 ng/mL for trastuzumab and afucosylated trastuzumab, respectively. Together, these results
confirm that the lack of fucose does not affect the FcγRindependent functions of trastuzumab. These functions include
HER2 binding, the immediate inhibition of the PI3K pathway,
and sustained inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.
Pharmacokinetic properties of afucosylated
trastuzumab
Removal of fucose does not affect IgG binding to FcRn
(23). However, carbohydrate composition or increased FcγR
affinity might have an effect on target-independent clearance
or drug disposition of the antibody (31). To address this
question, we performed pharmacokinetic analysis of afucosylated trastuzumab. For this purpose, the systemic disposition of trastuzumab and afucosylated trastuzumab was
evaluated in FcγRI−/−FcγRIII−/−RAG2−/−Tg (human FcγRIIIa)
mice following a single i.v. dose (10 mg/kg). Serum samples
(n = 4/time point) were analyzed for anti-HER2 antibodies
3 minutes to 28 days after administration of the antibodies.
Both molecules displayed biphasic systemic disposition, with
a rapid initial phase and a prolonged terminal phase (Fig. 2).
Afucosylated trastuzumab displayed increased clearance
(9.0 versus 6.8 mL/d/kg), decreased terminal half-life (10.1
versus 13.1 days), and decreased AUC 0-inf (1,118 versus
1,463 d × μg/mL) relative to trastuzumab (Fig. 2). Both
groups displayed a central volume of distribution values
(V1) that approximated mouse plasma volume. Taken together, these results show that afucosylated trastuzumab exhibited moderately altered pharmacokinetic dispositions
compared with trastuzumab, slightly faster elimination from
the circulation, and a modest reduction in half-life.
FcγR interaction is required for trastuzumab
response in the treatment of established
KPL-4 tumor xenografts
The KPL-4 breast cancer cell line harbors HER2 amplification (21) but does not respond to trastuzumab in vitro in a
proliferation assay (5). A “hotspot” PIK3CA mutation
(H1047R) generates constitutive PI3K/AKT signals and is

the likely cause for the trastuzumab insensitivity. However,
KPL-4 cells are sensitive to the FcγR-mediated trastuzumab
activity similar to BT474-M1 (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Despite the inability of trastuzumab to inhibit KPL-4 cell
proliferation, KPL-4 tumor xenografts respond to trastuzumab when treated with three weekly 15 mg/kg doses
(Fig. 3A, left). To confirm that the in vivo response is dependent on FcγR interaction, we also treated mice with
the D265A mutant of trastuzumab (T-D265A). The single
alanine substitution impairs binding of trastuzumab in all
human and mouse FcγR (13). Treatment of mice with
T-D265A resulted in almost complete loss of response
(Fig. 3A, left), confirming that trastuzumab response in the
treatment of KPL-4 tumors were due to the FcγR-dependent
effects of trastuzumab.
Increased in vivo efficacy of afucosylated trastuzumab
To assess the efficacy of afucosylated trastuzumab in vivo,
we treated established KPL-4 xenografts grown in the
mammary fat pads of SCID-beige mice with three weekly
10 mg/kg doses of trastuzumab or afucosylated trastuzumab.
Although both trastuzumab and afucosylated trastuzumab
inhibited the tumor growth (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively; log rank test), no difference was seen between the antibodies (P = 0.48; log rank test), indicating that the modest
increase in binding affinity to FcγRIV was not sufficient to
result in increased efficacy (Fig. 3A, right).
To further evaluate the activity of the afucosylated trastuzumab variant, we generated FcγRI−/−FcγRIII−/−RAG2−/−Tg
(human FcγRIIIa) mice that lack murine FcγRI (27) and
FcγRIII (26) and express the human FcγRIIIa transgene
(28). The transgene expression is controlled by the human
FcγRIIIa promoter and is expressed in NK cells and macrophages (28). Expression of the transgene in mice was

Superior In vivo Efficacy of Afucosylated Trastuzumab

confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of splenocyte mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Analysis of genomic
DNA showed that the transgene is the low-affinity FcγRIIIaF158 allele (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
For the efficacy studies, KPL-4 xenografts were grown in
the mammary fat pads of FcγRI −/− FcγRIII −/− RAG2 −/− Tg
(human FcγRIIIa) mice until the tumor size reached an
average of 125 mm3. At this point (day 0), mice were randomly
grouped for treatment regimens (n = 9) and treated with
single 1 or 3 mg/kg i.v. doses of trastuzumab, afucosylated
trastuzumab, or vehicle. Afucosylated trastuzumab inhibited
the growth of KPL-4 tumors more effectively than trastuzumab (Fig. 3B, left). Treatment with 3 mg/kg of trastuzumab
caused a significant delay in tumor progression (P = 0.003;
log rank test; Fig. 3B, right) and the efficacy of afucosylated
trastuzumab was significantly improved compared with trastuzumab (P = 0.010; Fig. 3B, right). The median progression-free
survival more than doubled for mice treated with afucosylated trastuzumab, compared with treatment with trastuzumab (48 versus 23.4 days, respectively; Fig. 3B, right).
We performed similar experiments using FcγRI−/−FcγRIII−/−
RAG2 −/− mice without the human transgene. The KPL-4
tumors were treated with three weekly 3 mg/kg i.v. doses of
the antibodies. No significant difference was observed in the
response to the antibodies, demonstrating that the increase
in the efficacy detected for afucosylated trastuzumab was mediated by the human FcγRIIIa transgene (Fig. 3C).
To ensure that the observed increase in efficacy was not modeldependent, the study was repeated using established MCF7neo/HER2 xenografts grown in FcγRI−/−FcγRIII−/−RAG2−/−Tg
(human FcγRIIIa) mice. Similar to KPL-4, these cells overexpress HER2 but do not respond to trastuzumab in vitro in a
proliferation assay. Again, afucosylated trastuzumab was
more potent than trastuzumab in treating MCF7-neo/
HER2 tumors, causing four complete responses and five partial responses (Fig. 3D). In contrast, no complete responses
and only one partial response was detected in trastuzumab-treated mice. Taken together, these results show that
the in vivo efficacy of afucosylated trastuzumab is superior
to trastuzumab in treating two preclinical models of HER2amplified breast cancer.

Discussion
It has been hypothesized that ADCC is a general mechanism of action for many therapeutic antibodies (32). However, it remains unclear whether ADCC or the engagement
of Fcγ receptors significantly contribute to trastuzumab's
antitumor effects in patients with breast cancer. After the initial in vitro findings, Ravetch and colleagues showed the in vivo
importance of FcγR-mediated activity of trastuzumab (13).
Notably, these studies did not address the role of FcγR
interaction in models with established tumors. Instead,
treatments were simultaneous with cell inoculation and thus
the results might portray the role of effector cell functions on
tumor implantation rather than its effect on solid tumor mass.
Our findings confirm the results of Clynes and colleagues and
extend them to the treatment of pre-established solid tumors.

The ability to increase in vitro ADCC by antibody engineering is widely established (33, 34). However, to our knowledge,
it has not been previously shown that the increase in antibody-FcγR interaction leads to increased in vivo efficacy in
the treatment of established nonhematologic tumors. To
directly address this question, we generated afucosylated
trastuzumab. The approach was selected primarily because
the affinity increase is significant and selective for FcγRIII.
Moreover, the variant can be readily produced and is
completely devoid of fucose. Fucose in the oligosaccharide
(at Asn297) of IgG1 hinders the interaction between carbohydrate of FcγRIIIa (at Asn162) and regions of IgG1 (35). Afucosylation results in increased affinity of the FcγR-IgG 1
interaction. The higher affinity observed by afucosylation is
selective for human FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb because the other
human FcγRs are not glycosylated at the corresponding position (35). Therefore, removing the fucose residue results in
increased affinity selectively for FcγRIII but not for other
FcγR, FcRn, or C1q (23).
We produced afucosylated trastuzumab in FUT8−/− CHO
cells (30). One alternative technology to produce afucosylated antibodies in CHO cells is to overexpress GnTIII and
ManII (35). Interestingly, the clearance of afucosylated trastuzumab was slightly faster than the clearance of trastuzumab in the transgenic mouse model. Hypothetically, the
faster clearance might be a result of differential biodistribution leading to the enrichment of antibodies to immune effector cell–rich organs due to increased FcγRIII affinity.
Using a mouse model that expresses a human FcγRIIIa
transgene in effector cells, we were able to successfully show
that an increase in affinity to FcγRIII results in improved efficacy when treating solid tumors. As with any preclinical
finding, confirmation of these results will require validation
in human clinical trials.
The superior efficacy of afucosylated trastuzumab is not
explained by an increase in antibody exposure. However, a
plausible mechanism for more effective tumor growth inhibition may be due to the observation that afucosylated antibodies could escape the inhibitory effect of serum IgG. Reports
by Iida and colleagues show that serum IgG markedly inhibits the efficacy of rituximab to deplete B cells (36). This inhibition has been attributed to the ability of IgG to compete
for FcγRIII binding. However, due to its higher affinity for
FcγRIII, afucosylated IgG might escape the inhibitory effect
of serum IgG (36–38).
The differential expression of HER2 in tumors relative to
normal tissue is thought to account for Herceptin's favorable
safety profile. The activity of trastuzumab in ADCC assays is
also specific for only high HER2-expressing target cells (11). To
maintain this safety profile, it is critical that any increase in
ADCC activity does not result in the cytotoxicity of cells that
express normal levels of HER2. Previous reports suggest that
low-fucose IgG1s could mediate ADCC at low antigen densities
at which their corresponding high-fucose counterparts do not
induce ADCC (39). However, our ADCC analysis using MCF10A cells (commonly used as a model for nontransformed
low HER2-expressing mammary epithelial cells) failed to detect any significant ADCC using afucosylated trastuzumab.

Because trastuzumab does not bind to murine ErbB2 (HER2),
the mouse model used in efficacy studies is not suitable
for safety studies. However, more detailed safety studies in
non-human primates are required. In conclusion, our results
support the development of effector function–enhanced antibodies for solid tumor therapy.
