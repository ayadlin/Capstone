BACKGROUND: The role of consolidation radiotherapy was examined for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were
treated at institutions of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network during the rituximab era. METHODS: Failure-free survival (FFS)
and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in terms of patient and treatment characteristics. Potential associations were investigated
with univariate and multivariate survival analysis and matched pair analysis. RESULTS: There were 841 patients, and most (710 or
84%) received 6 to 8 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP); 293 (35%) received
consolidation radiation therapy (RT). Failure occurred for 181 patients: 126 patients (70%) who did not receive RT and 55 patients
(30%) who did. At 5 years, both OS and FFS rates were better for patients who had received RT versus those who did not (OS, 91%
vs 83% [P 5.01]; FFS, 83% vs 76% [P 5.05]). A matched pair analysis (217 pairs matched by age, stage, International Prognostic Index
[IPI] score, B symptoms, disease bulk, and response to chemotherapy) showed that the receipt of RT improved OS (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.53 [P 5.07]) and FFS (HR, 0.77 [P 5.34]) for patients with stage III/IV disease, but too few events took place among those
with stage I/II disease for meaningful comparisons (HR for OS, 0.94 [P 5.89]; HR for FFS, 1.81 [P 5.15]). A multivariate analysis suggested that the IPI score and the response to chemotherapy had the greatest influence on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There was a
trend of higher OS and FFS rates for patients who had received consolidation RT after R-CHOP (especially for patients with stage III/

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 2 decades, recognition of the complexity of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has led to considerable
changes in the recommended treatment, as reflected in guidelines from the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN). A variety of pathologic, laboratory, and cytogenetic factors are now used to predict individual patients’
responses to therapy and subsequent clinical outcomes.1-5 In addition, response-adapted therapy based on changes in 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography is being introduced into the NCCN guidelines as findings
on individually tailored chemotherapy become mature.6-11 The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy became standard therapy in the early 2000s on the basis of available
scientific evidence.12 On the other hand, whether radiation therapy (RT) has a role in the treatment of DLBCL continues
to be the subject of an ongoing controversy,13 which partly reflects and is an extrapolation of the late side effects that

developed in patients treated for Hodgkin’s several decades ago when both radiation techniques and fields were
rudimentary in comparison with the technology available
today. In addition, conflicting evidence has come from
both randomized and single-institution studies.4,10,14-20
In view of these developments and technological advances
in the planning and delivery of RT, we chose to examine
the effects of using modern-day RT techniques for
DLBCL at NCCN institutions on outcomes.
For this analysis, we used the NCCN outcomes
database, which includes comprehensive, prospectively
collected data on clinical characteristics, treatment factors, and outcomes for patients being treated for nonHodgkin lymphoma. We sought to determine whether
RT influenced failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL of
any stage who had been treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
(R-CHOP) chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

We identified patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL
presenting at 1 of 7 member institutions of the NCCN
from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2008. The
841 patients in this analysis had a confirmed diagnosis of
DLBCL that had been treated with R-CHOP with or
without consolidation RT (defined as RT received within
the first 90 days after the completion of chemotherapy).
Patients were excluded if they had experienced disease
relapse or progression during first-line therapy (including
RT) or their therapy had been protocol-directed. The following characteristics were retrieved: age at diagnosis,
sex, race, Ann Arbor disease stage, revised International
Prognostic Index (IPI) score based on rituximab-era
data,15 presence of B symptoms and bulky disease
(defined as 10 cm in the maximum dimension), site of
disease (nodal vs extranodal; patients who had any extranodal site were grouped as extranodal), type and number
of cycles of chemotherapy, response to chemotherapy,
type of imaging used to assess the response, use of radiation, site of failure (with respect to radiation fields), and
disease and vital status at the last follow-up (with cause
of death if applicable). The 5-year FFS and OS rates
were calculated as described later.
Pathology specimens (excisional and core-needle biopsy samples) were handled at each NCCN institution;
no central review was done.
RT was recommended at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist; the radiation fields were involvedCancer

field. Unfortunately, the radiation dose was not provided
so we could not perform a dose-response analysis.
Statistical Analysis

The definitions of response used in the NCCN database
were as follows. Complete remission (including undetermined complete remission) was defined as the complete
disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic
evidence of disease and all disease-related symptoms if
they were present before therapy and the normalization of
biochemical abnormalities (lactate dehydrogenase) attributable to non-Hodgkin lymphoma lasting at least 4 weeks.
Partial remission was defined as a <50% response as indicated by images obtained at the end of therapy. Bulky disease was 10 cm in the maximum dimension. For the
purposes of this study, FFS was defined as the time from
the completion of treatment to relapse; OS was defined as
the time from the time of diagnosis to the date of last
follow-up or the date of death. Baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics were compared between subgroups
with chi-square tests (for categorical variables) or
Wilcoxon rank sum tests (for medians). Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the potential factors that influenced 5-year OS and freedom from
progression. Factors with a P value  .25 were tested in a
multivariate model. Cox proportional hazards regression
was used to build the multivariate model. All statistical
analyses were performed with Stata/SE 2011 (StataCorp,
College Station, Texas).
We also assessed FFS and OS by using a matched
cohort analysis as follows. Patients were paired according
to whether they had or had not received RT, and they
were matched for known prognostic factors, including
age, sex, disease stage, IPI score, the presence of B symptoms or bulky disease, the number of chemotherapy cycles
delivered, and the response to chemotherapy. Patients
who had received RT were exactly matched (without
placement) to R-CHOP–only patients to the third decimal place (thousandths) of the propensity score on a 1:1
basis. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed
with stratification on the propensity score (rounded to the
tenth place) to account for the matching nature of the
data.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
median follow-up time was 4.5 years (range, 0.5-10.7
years), and the median age at diagnosis was 57.1 years
(range, 18-91 years). Four hundred fifty-five patients
(54%) were male, 689 (82%) were Caucasian, and 402

(22%) had an IPI score of 0, and 446 (53%) had an IPI
score of 1 or 2; 240 (29%) had B symptoms at presentation, and 192 (23%) had bulky disease at presentation
(including 88 patients with stage I/II disease). Six hundred twenty patients (74%) presented with nodal disease.
Most patients (710 or 84%) had 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP
(74% of those with stage I/II disease and 94% of those
with stage III/IV disease), and 101 (12%) received intrathecal methotrexate; 293 (35%) received consolidation
RT (217 had stage I/II disease [64 with bulky disease],
and 76 had stage III/IV disease [23 with bulky disease]).
In terms of disease response, 633 (75%) had a complete
response. Most of the patients with bulky stage I/II disease
(73%) had received RT, whereas 22% of the patients with
bulky stage III/IV disease had.

Patients who received radiation, in comparison with
those who did not, were significantly younger (54 vs 58
years, P < .0001), were more likely to have stage I-II disease (74% vs 38%, P < .0001), were more likely to have a
lower IPI score (89% vs 68%, P < .0001), were more
likely to have bulky disease (30% vs 19%, P 5 .0005),
were more likely to have extranodal disease (38% vs 20%,
P < .0001), and were more likely to receive abbreviated
chemotherapy (28% vs 9%, P < .0001). The response to
treatment, evaluated within 2 months of therapy completion, was assessed with computed tomography in 219
patients (26%: 143 in the R-CHOP–only group and 76
in the R-CHOP1RT group), with positron emission tomography in 145 patients (17%: 97 in the R-CHOP–

only group and 110 in the R-CHOP1RT group). Most
patients (633 or 75%) experienced complete remission after R-CHOP; 192 of those patients had received RT.
Another 187 patients (22%) experienced partial remission, and 93 of these patients had received RT; 6 patients
had stable disease; and 15 could not be evaluated. At the
time of this analysis, 119 patients had died (88 in the RCHOP–only group and 31 in the R-CHOP1RT group);
notably, a majority (66 or 55%) had died of progressive
disease (Table 2).
Factors Contributing to OS and FFS

The 5-year OS and FFS rates were significantly higher
for patients who had received RT (OS, 91%; FFS, 83%)
versus those who did not (OS, 83% [P 5 .05]; FFS, 76%
[P 5 .01]; Figs. 1 and 2). A univariate analysis revealed
that the following factors influenced both 5-year OS and

B symptoms (OS for no symptoms, 91%; FFS for no

disease, 88%; FFS for no disease, 81%; OS for disease,
77%; FFS for disease, 70% [P 5 .0003]). Having extranodal disease at presentation was associated with FFS
(85% vs 76% for nodal disease only, P 5 .008) but not
with OS. Finally, a response to therapy was also associated with both OS and FFS (OS with a complete
response, 88%; FFS with a complete response, 81%; OS
without a complete response, 79%; FFS without a complete response, 72% [P 5 .0003]).
In multivariate analyses, the use of RT was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward a lower risk of
death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67) and failure (HR, 0.86).
The response to therapy and the IPI score had the greatest
influences on both OS and FFS; patients with an IPI
score > 3 had HRs of 9.9 and 6.4 for death and failure,
respectively (P < .0001 for both), and those who achieved
a complete remission had an HR of 0.50 for death
(P 5 .0009) and an HR of 0.57 for failure (P 5 .001).
The presence of B symptoms and bulky disease and the
receipt of <6 cycles of chemotherapy also influenced both
OS and FFS (P 5 .01; for details, see Table 4).
To further examine influences on FFS and OS, we
undertook a matched pair survival analysis using

propensity scores to estimate the effects of RT and
observed covariates (age, disease stage, IPI score, number
of chemotherapy cycles, B symptoms, bulky disease, and
response to therapy) on OS and FFS (Table 5). There
were 201 total matched pairs: 125 had stage I/II disease,
and 76 had stage III/IV disease. This analysis showed that
the use of RT seemed to reduce the risk of death (HR,
0.76) and failure (HR, 0.92) among all patients and particularly among patients with stage III/IV disease (HR for
death, 0.53; HR for failure, 0.77), but these effects were
not statistically significant (Table 5). Surprisingly, the use
of RT for patients with stage I/II disease seemed to be
associated with a higher failure rate (HR, 1.81), although
the P value for this comparison was also not significant.
The rather illogical finding of higher failure rates for
patients given RT for stage I/II disease led us to perform
the following subset analyses. The first of these subset
analyses separated patients with stage I/II disease into 1 of
2 subgroups: those who had received abbreviated chemo1036

therapy (<6 cycles of R-CHOP, n 5 103) and those who
had received the full 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP (n 5 296).
For patients who received <6 cycles of R-CHOP, the
receipt of RT (vs no RT) was associated with a nonsignificant trend of higher OS (HR, 0.4 [P 5 .19]) and FFS
(HR, 0.44 [P 5 .24]). On the other hand, patients who
received RT after the standard full course of R-CHOP
had worse OS (HR, 2.06 [P 5 .22]) and FFS (HR, 3.27
[P 5 .01]) than those who did not receive RT (Table 4).
Other attempts to evaluate OS and FFS in terms of disease
bulk and nodal-only presentation versus extranodal presentation also showed no statistically significant associations (data not shown).
In the second and final subset analysis, we looked at
sites of failure with respect to the receipt or nonreceipt of
RT (Table 6). In that comparison, we found that the total
number of failure sites was 126 (70%) among patients
who did not receive RT versus 55 (30%) among those
who did receive RT; moreover, failure appeared at the

same presenting disease site in 23% of those who did not
receive RT versus only 8% of those who did receive RT.
These findings suggest that RT was helpful for minimizing the number of failure sites and preventing local
recurrence.
DISCUSSION
Recent clinical reports indicate that RT may have merit
for the treatment of patients with DLBCL during the rituximab era. The published report of the RICOVER-60
trial,21 in which 166 elderly patients with DLBCL of all
Cancer

April 1, 2015

stages of disease were treated, compared the results of the
best arm of immunochemotherapy [6RCHOP12R]
(2R 5 2 additional cycles of Rituximab) plus 36 Gy to initial bulky sites (7.5 cm) with the results of a cohort
treated without radiation. Although the radiation treatment decision was not randomized, those treated with
radiation showed statistically significant improvements in
OS (90% for the RT group versus 65% for the group with
no RT, P 5 .00]) and event-free survival (80% for the RT
group versus 54% for the group with no RT, P 5 .001).

conducted by the German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma Study Group, randomized 450 patients with
DLBCL of all stages to receive either R-CHOP-14 (given
every 14 days) or R-CHOP-21 (given every 21 days) with
a second randomization to radiation or observation for
patients with extranodal or bulky disease. Similar to the
patients of the RICOVER trial, these were patients with
all stages of disease. Final results have not yet been published. However, the RT randomization arms were closed
when the second interim analysis showed a higher failure
rate in the no-RT arm (data presented at the 2012 Annual
Meeting of the American Society of Hematology).
Since rituximab became part of the standard of care
for DLBCL, other trials have also addressed the role of
radiation treatment for DLBCL of all stages, albeit indirectly or retrospectively. The MabThera International
Trial17 evaluated the benefit of adding rituximab to
CHOP for patients with stages II-IV or bulky stage I
DLBCL. Rituximab minimized but did not eliminate the
adverse prognostic effects of tumor bulk on outcomes,
and this suggested that RT could have merit for patients
with bulky disease, regardless of the stage. A retrospective
study from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in which
most patients had received 6 or more cycles of R-CHOP
showed that the addition of radiation improved both OS
and progression-free survival (PFS) across all disease
stages: the 5-year OS and PFS rates were 90% and 91%
for those who received radiation and 75% and 83% for
those who did not (P < .001). A matched pair analysis

based on the disease stage and accounting for the number
of cycles of R-CHOP, radiation, IPI score, tumor
response to therapy, and disease bulk confirmed the benefit of radiation, with longer OS and PFS times for those
who received radiation (HR for OS, 0.52; HR for PFS,
0.45).20
The present observational analysis of outcomes
includes a large cohort of patients with DLBCL of all
stages who were treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy
with or without radiation. Radiation was predominantly
given to patients with limited-stage disease and those with
extranodal and/or bulky tumor sites. The decision for RT
referral for treatment was at the discretion of the treating
medical oncologist, and this in turn represented an
uncontrolled selection bias for the radiation treatment
group. In addition, patients were treated across several
institutions, and compliance with the intended treatment
might have been unaccounted. The use of radiation varied
among the institutions (5%-31%), and this heterogeneity
was also inherently difficult to control.
A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the whole group
of patients indicated overall improvements in both OS
and FFS. The multivariate analysis, however, did not
show FFS improvement, and there was no significant difference in outcomes by institution. Given the heterogeneity of factors in the patient cohort, however, we
performed a matched pair analysis including 217 pairs of
patients. In the matched pair analysis, there was no statistically different outcome for those who received radiation.
A possible explanation for RT not having an overall positive benefit in the matched cohorts is that these were predominantly patients with early-stage disease. The number
of failure events seen overall in the limited-stage group
was very low (with only 26 failures out of 402 patients or
6%). When we analyzed outcomes by subsets with the
worst prognostic factors (a high IPI score, bulky disease,
and a less than complete response to chemotherapy), a
benefit of RT was seen for those with stage III/IV disease
and those with stage I/II who had received abbreviated
chemotherapy (<6 cycles of chemotherapy).
The results of this analysis in general align with those
observed in previously noted studies suggesting that RT
may contribute to improved outcomes for certain subsets
of patients with DLBCL. The challenge remains of defining the criteria by which the patients most likely to benefit
can be identified. It is evident from practice patterns that,
despite observed variations, medical and radiation oncologists are applying radiation treatment in combination
with chemotherapy for DLBCL in select patients. Radiation, however, is not without adverse effects, particularly

when it is combined with chemotherapy. Hence, to obtain
the most benefit with the fewest side effects, it is essential
to incorporate technological innovations in the field of
radiation oncology planning and delivery to substantially
reduce the acute and long-term side effects of RT. In addition, to prevent unnecessary treatment and potential
harm, it is critical to prospectively study and definitively
identify the factors that define the unique subsets of
patients for whom combined modality therapy would be
most appropriate.
