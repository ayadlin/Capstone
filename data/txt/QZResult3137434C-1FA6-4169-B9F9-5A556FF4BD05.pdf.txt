ABSTRACT
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation is a major cause of metastasis
in many cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However,
whether the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mediates EGF-enhanced HNSCC
metastasis remains unclear. Interestingly, we found that EGF induced COX-2 expression
mainly in HNSCC. The tumor cell transformation induced by EGF was repressed by COX2 knockdown, and this repression was reversed by simultaneously treating the cells
with EGF and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The down-regulation of COX-2 expression or
inhibition of COX-2 activity significantly blocked EGF enhancement of cell migration
and invasion, but the addition of PGE2 compensated for this inhibitory effect in COX2-knockdown cells. COX-2 depletion inhibited EGF-induced matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and fibronectin expression and Rac1/cdc42
activation. The inhibitory effect of COX-2 depletion on MMPs and the fibronectin/
Rac1/cdc42 axis were reversed by co-treatment with PGE2. Furthermore, depletion
of fibronectin impeded the COX-2-enhanced binding of HNSCC cells to endothelial
cells and tumor cells metastatic seeding of the lungs. These results demonstrate
that EGF-induced COX-2 expression enhances HNSCC metastasis via activation of the
fibronectin signaling pathway. The inhibition of COX-2 expression and activation may
be a potential strategy for the treatment of EGFR-mediated HNSCC metastasis.

[1, 2]. Over 50% of newly diagnosed patients do not
achieve complete remission, and nearly 10% are recurrent
cases with metastasis to distant organs [3]. Therefore,

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is the sixth most common cancer in the world [1]. Although
there has been much research on the treatment of HNSCC,

to develop effective therapeutic strategies are required.
Several biomarkers related to HNSCC pathogenesis and
tumor progression have been described, including TP53
mutations [4], the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV)
[5] or its surrogate marker p16 [6] and altered expression
of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), which can provide prognostic information
[1, 7, 8]. Cetuximab is currently the only EGFR-targeted
drug approved for treating HNSCC. Cetuximab is
used in combination with locoregional radiotherapy or
chemotherapy in the recurrent and/or metastatic setting [9,
10]. However, the first-generation EGFR tyrosine-kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib show minimal
tumor inhibition efficacy as monotherapies in HNSCC [11,
12]. Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, also known as
COX-2, catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to
prostaglandins and thromboxanes [13, 14]. It is well known
that the up-regulation of COX-2 contributes to increased
antiapoptotic, angiogenic and metastatic potential in many
types of cancer, such as lung, colon, breast, and pancreatic
cancer and HNSCC cancers [15–17]. In addition, COX-2 is
an early gene that is rapidly induced by pro-inflammatory
cytokines (interleukin (IL) 1β, IL2 and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)), growth factors (EGF and platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF)), lipopolysaccharides, bile acids,
ultraviolet B irradiation and tumor promoters [18–21].
In previous studies, COX-2 was found to be involved in
cancer tumor cell metastasis by regulating biochemical
changes, including altering matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-2, MMP-9, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) marker expression and increasing tumor cell
adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and
endothelial cells [22–24]. Interestingly, fibronectin is
expressed in several types of carcinoma cells, and many
studies have demonstrated a role for fibronectin in human
solid tumor formation [25–27]; fibronectin can also regulate
COX-2 expression [25, 28–30]. However, the function of
fibronectin in COX-2-mediated metastasis remains unclear.
Similar to COX-2, EGFR is overexpressed in many
human tumor types and is associated with poor prognosis and
decreased survival [31]. Activation of the EGFR signaling
pathway or expression of EGFR family members can impact
tumor metastasis [32, 33]. EGFR activation leads to increased
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, resulting
in aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)/
AP-1-mediated COX-2 expression [34, 35]. COX-2-derived
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can activate EGFR signaling to
stimulate cell proliferation. In addition, the correlation
between COX-2 and the EGFR pathway in tumorigenesis
has been demonstrated, suggesting that combination therapy
with COX-2 and EGFR inhibitors would be more effective
in tumor suppression than either agent alone [22, 36]. In
clinical trials, dual functional blockade of EGFR and COX-2
in HNSCC and in lung cancer has been investigated [37, 38].
Notably, however, it is unknown whether COX-2 induction
is correlated with EGF-enhanced HNSCC metastasis.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In this study, we reveal for the first time that the
induction of COX-2 correlates with EGF-enhanced HNSCC
metastasis. We demonstrate that EGF-induced COX-2
up-regulates the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3,
MMP-9 and fibronectin and promotes the activation of
Rac1/cdc42 to enhance HNSCC migration and invasion.
These results indicate that EGF-induced COX-2 enhances
HNSCC metastasis through the fibronectin/Rac1/cdc42
signaling pathway. COX-2 inhibition provides a new
strategy for the treatment of EGFR-mediated HNSCC
metastasis.

RESULTS
Induction of COX-2 expression and
enhancement of anchorage-independent growth
in EGF-treated HNSCC cells
We have previously reported that EGF induces
COX-2 expression in A431 cells to enhance cell migration
[19]. To further clarify whether the COX-2 induction is
a general phenomenon of EGF-treated tumor cells, we
examined several types of tumor cell lines. We found
that EGF significantly induced COX-2 expression in
various HNSCC cell lines (Figure 1A). However, the
induction of COX-2 expression was not observed in
other cell types, including breast cancer, lung cancer
and colorectal carcinoma cells (Supplemental Figure
S1A). We next investigated the association of the COX2 gene expression signature with HNSCC by data mining
using the cancer microarray database Oncomine 4.0
(Oncomine DB at http://www.oncomine.org) [39]. COX-2
expression in normal and malignant or metastatic tissues
from HNSCC patients was compared using published
datasets, and results demonstrated that COX-2 expression
was higher in malignant tissues than in normal tissues
from HNSCC patients (Supplemental Figure S1B).
Significantly, COX-2 expression was remarkably higher
in metastatic tissues (Supplemental Figure S1B). These
results suggest that higher levels of COX-2 mRNA are
expressed in clinical HNSCC tissues than normal tissues
(p < 0.05). To study the role of EGF-induced COX-2
expression in HNSCC, we examined the effect of COX2 on EGF-induced cellular transformation using soft
agar assays. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of COX-2
expression was performed in HONE1 cells (shCOX-2)
(Figure 1B, upper panel), and results showed a decrease
in EGF-enhanced actin polymerization following COX2 silencing (Figure 1B, lower panel). Increases in size
and number of colonies grown in soft agar in response
to EGF stimulation were inhibited in shCOX-2 cells,
whereas shCOX-2 cell colony formation in soft agar was
restored by simultaneously treating cells with EGF and
PGE2 (Supplemental Figures S2A and S2B). These results
indicate that COX-2 contributes to EGF-induced cell
transformation and cytoskeletal rearrangement.

the transendothelial assay was utilized. EGF-induced
transendothelial invasion was significantly reduced in
COX-2 knockdown cells (Figure 2D and Supplemental
Figure S3A); however, the simultaneous treatment of
COX-2 knockdown cells with PGE2 and EGF restored
their invasive capacity (Figure 2D and Supplemental
Figure S3A). In addition, PGE2, the main product of COX2 activity, enhanced transendothelial invasion and EGFinduced invasion (Supplemental Figure S3B). However,
the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib blocked EGF-induced, but
not PGE2-induced anchorage-independent growth and
transendothelial invasion, indicating that PGE2 did not
induce its effects on cellular function through the EGFR
pathway (Supplemental Figures S4A and S4B). These
results suggest that induction of COX-2 following EGFR
activation is essential for EGF-induced cell invasion
and transformation. In an in vivo metastasis assay, lung
metastasis following tail vein injection of EGF-treated
tumor cells was significantly increased in the parental

EGFR activation is a major cause of metastasis in
many cancers [33, 40]. COX-2 depletion also inhibited
EGF-induced actin polymerization (Figure 1B, lower
panel), indicating that COX-2 may participate in EGFregulated cell mobility. To determine whether induction
of COX-2 mediates EGF-induced tumor metastasis,
we performed Transwell migration, invasion and
transendothelial invasion assays. As shown in Figure 2A,
inhibition of COX-2 activity with celecoxib dramatically
reduced EGF-stimulated cell migration, suggesting
that COX-2 activity is required for EGF-mediated cell
migration. The inhibition of cell migration was further
confirmed in shCOX-2 cells (Figure 2B). In addition,
COX-2 depletion reduced EGF-stimulated cell invasion
(Figure 2C), which was rescued when the shCOX-2 cells
were simultaneously treated with PGE2 and EGF (Figure
2C). To further clarify whether EGF-induced COX-2

expression by EGF was blocked in COX-2 knockdown
cells (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figures S8A and S8B).
The inhibition of fibronectin and phospho-Rac1/cdc42
in the COX-2 knockdown cells was overcome by PGE2
treatment (Figure 4B, and Supplemental Figures S8A and
S8B). In addition, PGE2 alone also induced the expression
of fibronectin and phosphorylation of Rac1/cdc42 in
parental and COX-2 knockdown cells (Supplemental
Figure S8). To further confirm that COX-2 activation
was associated with cell mobility, the activation of
phospho-FAK and phospho-Rac1/cdc42 was examined
in cells treated with PGE2. As shown in Figure 5A, PGE2
significantly induced the expression of fibronectin and the
activation of phospho-FAK/Rac1/cdc42, similar to the
effects of EGF stimulation. Although EGF- and PGE2induced phospho-FAK/Rac1/cdc42 signaling was inhibited
in cells treated with compound Y15 (Figure 5B), which
specifically inhibits FAK-Y397 autophosphorylation
[41–43], no effect of Y15 on EGF-induced COX-2
expression was observed (Figure 5B). To further clarify
the correlation between fibronectin and COX-2 expression,
the effect of fibronectin overexpression or knockdown on
COX-2 expression in EGF-treated cells was examined. As
shown in Figures 5C and 5D, fibronectin overexpression
activated phospho-Rac1/cdc42; however, fibronectin
did not affect COX-2 expression. Lentiviral shRNA
knockdown of fibronectin expression was performed in
HONE1 cells (shFN). In addition, depletion of fibronectin
inhibited phospho-FAK and phospho-Rac1/cdc42 but had
no effect on EGF-induced COX-2 expression (Figure 5A
and Supplemental Figures S9A and S9B). These results
indicate that induction of the fibronectin/FAK/Rac1/cdc42
signaling pathway is dependent on EGF-induced COX-2
expression and activation.

EGF-induced COX-2 activates the fibronectin/
FAK/Rac1/cdc42 signaling axis
To clarify the mechanism involved in the regulation
of tumor metastasis by EGF-induced COX-2, we examined
changes in EMT markers in cells treated with EGF or PGE2.
As shown in Supplemental Figures S6A and S6B, EGF
significantly induced the expression of MMPs. To verify
the role of COX-2 in the induction of MMP expression, the
expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-2 was
examined in shCOX-2 cells. EGF-induced MMP-1 and
MMP-3 expression was significantly inhibited in shCOX-2
cells (Figure 3A). Co-treatment with PGE2 restored the
MMP-1 and MMP-3 levels in the EGF-treated shCOX-2
cells (Figure 3B). To further confirm whether the EGFinduced expression of MMP mRNA was via the induction
of COX-2, the promoter activity of MMPs was examined
in shCOX-2 cells. As shown in Figures 3C-3E, the EGFinduced promoter activity of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP9 was inhibited in shCOX-2 cells. Although the downregulation of MMP promoter activity in the EGF-treated
shCOX-2 cells was reversed by PGE2 in a dose-dependent
manner (Figures 3C-3E), MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9
were not induced by PGE2 in the absence of EGF (Figures
3C-3E). However, both EGF and PGE2 significantly
induced the expression of MMP-2 mRNA (Figure 3F
and Supplemental Figure S6C). The inhibition of MMP2 expression in EGF-treated shCOX-2 cells was also
reversed by PGE2. These results reveal that the induction
of COX-2 expression is essential for EGF-induced MMP1, MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression. Nevertheless,
activation of COX-2 affected MMP-2 expression but not
MMP-1, MMP-3 or MMP-9, indicating that cooperation
between COX-2 and EGF-activated signaling is required
for MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression.
EMT markers, such as slug, twist, vimentin,
and N-cadherin were significantly induced by EGF
(Supplemental Figure S7A). In addition, EGF also
enhanced expression of fibronectin, phospho-Rac1/cdc42
and phospho-FAK (Supplemental Figures S7B and S7C).
As shown above, fibronectin expression, activation of
the FAK/Rac1/cdc42 axis downstream of fibronectin,
and tumor migration were concomitantly induced by
EGF. We examined whether EGF-induced changes in
fibronectin and phospho-Rac1/cdc42, which in turn
increase cell migration, are mediated by COX-2 induction
in HNSCC. Although the EGF-induced expression of
slug, twist, vimentin and N-cadherin was not altered in
the shCOX-2 cells (data not shown), depletion of COX2 dramatically inhibited EGF-induced expression of
fibronectin (Figure 4 and Supplemental Figures S8A and
S8B). Furthermore, the induction of phospho-Rac1/cdc42

Depletion of fibronectin inhibits PGE2-induced
tumor invasion and interaction with
endothelial cells
We found that EGF concomitantly induced cell
migration and invasion and fibronectin expression. In
addition, an analysis of fibronectin expression between
normal and malignant tissues from HNSCC patients
in published datasets [39] revealed higher fibronectin
expression levels in malignant versus normal tissues
(Supplemental Figure S9C). To clarify whether the
induction of fibronectin is important for mediating COX-2induced cell invasion, the effects of EGF and PGE2 on cell
invasion were examined in shFN cells. Consistent with
reduced actin polymerization with COX-2 knockdown
(Figure 1B), disruption of actin polymerization following
fibronectin depletion suggested that EGF-mediated
cytoskeletal rearrangement was dependent on fibronectin
expression (Supplemental Figure S9D). Furthermore,
we assessed the effect of fibronectin expression on PGE2induced cell transendothelial invasion. As shown in

Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 10A, depletion of

signaling pathway.

Distant metastasis relies on tumor cell attachment to
blood vessels [44]. Thus, we further tested the possibility
that the metastatic process enhanced by EGF-induced
COX-2 might occur via regulation of the interaction
between tumor and endothelial cells. As shown in Figure
6B, EGF promoted the binding of HONE1 cells to HMEC1 cells, and this binding was dramatically reduced in
shCOX-2 cells. The inhibition of this tumor-endothelial
cell interaction in shCOX-2 cells was reversed when cells
were treated with both EGF and PGE2 (Figure 6B). To
further confirm that the activation of COX-2 is required for
the tumor-endothelial cell interaction, HNSCC cells were
treated with PGE2, which dramatically induced binding to
endothelial cells, as shown in Figure 6C and Supplemental
Figure S10B. In addition, the induction of the tumorendothelial cell interaction was also blocked in shFN cells
(Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure S10B). These results
indicate that COX-2 and fibronectin stimulate the binding
of tumor cells to endothelial cells, which may result in
enhanced capacity to penetrate blood vessels.

for 3 h and then injected into the tail vein of mice. No
obvious lung nodules were detected when fibronectin
was depleted in the HNSCC cells, whereas the PGE2treated parental tumor cells developed significant nodules
(Figure 7A and Supplemental Figure S11A). Hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining revealed that the lungs of mice
receiving the PGE2-treated parental tumor cells contained
significantly more and larger micrometastatic colonies
than those receiving the shFN cells (Figures 7B and 7C,
and Supplemental Figure S11B). These results suggest
that fibronectin is essential for PGE2- primed HNSCC
metastasis.

DISCUSSION
In the current treatment of head and neck
cancers, cetuximab plus radiation therapy improves
overall survival in patients without distal metastases
[10]. However, few patients benefit from cetuximab,
which is the only EGFR-targeted therapy approved for
HNSCC [9, 10]. Many studies have indicated that in
most patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors, tumors
will subsequently become refractory [45]. These studies
indicate that the dysregulation of EGFR activation and
downstream signaling pathways may interfere with
therapeutic efficacy in HNSCC. For example, resistance
to cetuximab has been correlated with the dysregulation
of EGFR family members HER2 and HER3 [45, 46].
The major impediments to curing advanced HNSCC are

tightly related to metastasis, which may contribute to
drug resistance. However, the EGFR target that enhances
HNSCC metastasis remains unclear. In addressing this
challenge, we investigated whether the induction of COX2 regulates EGF-induced metastasis. Indeed, we found
that the autocrine production of PGE2 by EGF-induced
COX-2 regulates fibronectin expression, which promotes
HNSCC metastasis. Our survey of COX-2 and fibronectin
expression in clinical human HNSCC samples from a
microarray database suggested that up-regulation of COX2 and fibronectin is associated with malignant HNSCC.
Consistent with these results, Pan J et al. revealed that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the concomitant expression of EGFR and COX-2 in
HNSCC correlated with poor prognosis [47]. Therefore,
therapeutically targeting COX-2 and fibronectin in
EGFR-stimulated HNSCC metastasis would be of interest
because metastasis represents the main clinical challenge
after primary tumor resection.
In this study, we first clarified the mechanism by
which EGF-induced COX-2 expression promotes HNSCC
metastasis. Our results revealed that PGE2, the COX-2
product of arachidonic acid, enhances the expression
of fibronectin, resulting in enhanced tumor metastasis.

and growth factors, which are known to drive COX-2
gene expression through NF-κB and AP-1 activation,
respectively [19, 48]. In addition, several reports have
demonstrated that fibronectin overexpression enhances
COX-2 expression. For example, activation of the α5β1/
FAK/p38 MAPK pathway was shown to be involved in
fibronectin-induced COX-2 expression in HUVECs, and
COX-2 contributed to the angiogenic effect of fibronectin
[30]. Fibronectin up-regulates COX-2 expression
and PGE2 production to enhance MMP-2 activity in
rhabdomyosarcoma and promote lung carcinoma cell
proliferation [25, 28]. Interestingly, engulfment and
cell motility 1 (ELMO1) interacts with COX-2 to
further regulate COX-2 activity and increase fibronectin
expression to promote the development of renal
glomerular disease [49]. In our study, although knockdown
of COX-2 dramatically inhibited EGF-induced fibronectin
expression, we found that knockdown of fibronectin had
no effect on COX-2 expression in EGF-treated HNSCC
cells. In addition, fibronectin overexpression enhanced
the activation of Rac1/cdc42 but had no effect on
COX-2 expression. Interestingly, PGE2 alone promoted
HNSCC transendothelial invasion through the induction
of fibronectin. These results are in contrast to previous
reports showing that COX-2 is induced by fibronectin in
lung carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and HUVECs [25, 28,
30]. The difference in signaling molecules participating in
the EGFR-COX-2-fibronectin signaling pathway may be
due to a cell type-specific response to EGF treatment. For
example, we observed EGF-induced COX-2 expression
in HNSCC cell lines but not in breast cancer, colorectal
cancer or lung cancer cell lines. Thus, the EGFR-COX-2fibronectin pathway is one of various routes to drive EGF
mediated HNSCC metastasis. Indeed, EGF-activated FAK
and Rac1/cdc42 were decreased in fibronectin-deficient
cells, even though COX-2 remained induced by EGF, or
in cells pretreated with PGE2. These results reveal that
COX-2 loses its ability to activate FAK and Rac1/cdc42
when fibronectin is depleted. Taken together, these results
indicate that the regulation of fibronectin by COX-2 plays
an important role in tumor metastasis.
The induction of MMPs is a major cause of
tumor invasion. Several reports have shown that COX2 inhibitors reduce HNSCC viability and invasion by
down-regulating MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF secretion
[50, 51]. In agreement with these findings, we also found
that EGF-induced COX-2 enhanced HNSCC invasion
through the induction of MMPs, such as MMP-1, MMP-2,
MMP-3 and MMP-9. However, the mechanism involved
in COX-2-mediated MMPs expression remains unclear.
The induction of MMP-9 by PGE2 in TNF-α treated
cholangiocarcinoma cells has been reported to occur
through the activation of EP2/4 receptors [52]. Therefore,
it will be of interest to clarify whether the downstream
signaling of EP receptors is essential for EGF-induced
MMPs expression. In addition to EGF, IL-1β and TNF-α
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also trigger MMP-1 and MMP-3 production in gingival
fibroblasts. However, except for IL-1β and TNF-α, EGFinduced MMP-1/3 expression was not altered when
the cells were treated with a COX-2 inhibitor [53]. The
discrepancy between these results and our findings could
be due to differences in downstream signaling activated by
EGF in normal versus tumor tissues. We found that COX2 knockdown inhibited EGF-induced MMP-1, MMP-2,
MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression and that this phenomenon
was reversed by treating the cells with both EGF and
PGE2. However, except for MMP-2, PGE2 alone did not
induce the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9.
These results reveal that cooperation with EGF-activated
unknown factors is essential for PGE2 in the regulation of
MMPs expression in HNSCC.
During tumor metastasis, a major step required
for successful distant metastasis involves the ability of
circulating tumor cells to penetrate blood vessels [54]. We
also provide evidence demonstrating that EGF activation
induced the COX-2-primed tumor cell metastatic seeding
of the lungs. Using tail vein injection in an animal model,
EGF-primed tumor cell metastatic seeding of the lungs
was significantly inhibited with the depletion of COX-2
expression. Importantly, PGE2 also enhanced the formation
of lung nodules, and this priming of metastasis was
dramatically inhibited in shFN cells. In agreement with
our results, TGFβ induces ANGPTL4 expression to prime
the attachment of tumor cells to microvessels, resulting in
metastatic lung colonization [55]. These studies suggest
that the extravasation process, which is primed by growth
factor-induced proteins such as COX-2, fibronectin and
ANGPTL4, is a limiting step in distal tumor dissemination.
In addition, we also found that induction of COX-2 and
fibronectin by EGF enhanced the interaction between
tumor cells and endothelial cells. Several mediators of
pulmonary extravasation have recently been identified,
which are up-regulated in the primary tumors of breast
cancer patients with lung metastasis [54, 56]. These
include epiregulin, COX-2, MMP-1 and MMP-2, proteins
that support not only vascular remodeling in primary
tumors but also lung extravasation [56]. In conclusion,
we speculate that EGF-induced expression and activity
of COX-2 and fibronectin promotes tumor metastasis
by modulating adhesion between tumor and endothelial
cells. These results indicate that disruption of the adhesion
signaling axes between endothelial cells and tumor cells
may serve to prevent the dissemination of metastatic
HNSCC. Therefore, it is important to further elucidate
the role of COX-2 and the mechanisms involved in the
regulation of EGF-primed HNSCC metastasis.
Although few patients benefit from cetuximab,
which is the only EGFR-targeted drug approved for the
treatment of HNSCC, because not all cases of HNSCC are
dependent on EGFR [1], cetuximab in combination with
radiation therapy improves overall survival of HNSCC
patients. However, the majority of patients treated with
1733

Oncotarget

anti-EGFR drugs who have metastasis will suffer from
recurrences. Thus, there is no effective therapy for the
prevention of metastasis. Here, we provide evidence
to indicate that the inhibition of COX-2 efficiently
prevented lung metastasis of HNSCC. In addition,
significantly increased COX-2 expression was observed
in HNSCC [57]. Therefore, a combination therapy
involving anti-EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors is a possible
chemotherapeutic approach for treatment and metastasis
prevention in HNSCC patients. Indeed, efficacy studies
of dual EGFR/COX-2 inhibition are justified [58]. In
conclusion, we demonstrate the clinical and biological
function of EGF-induced COX-2 in HNSCC, providing
evidence that COX-2 has an important role in HNSCC
metastasis. COX-2 and fibronectin levels were increased
upon the activation of EGFR signaling, leading to tumor
metastasis. Measurement of COX-2 and fibronectin levels
in HNSCC may provide clinically useful prognostic
biomarkers in HNSCC metastasis and combinatorial
inhibition of both COX-2 and fibronectin might provide
a novel therapeutic approach for EGFR-overexpressing
HNSCC.

Anchorage-independent soft agar growth assay
Briefly, 1.5 ml per well of base agar matrix was
added to a 6-well plate. After solidification, 5000 cells
were plated in an agar matrix layer on top of the base.
Wells were topped with 1 ml of complete medium and
incubated for 14 days at 37°C with 5% CO2 to form
colonies, which were then stained with crystal violet
(0.4 g/l; Sigma-Aldrich).

Migration and invasion assays
Both assays were performed using Millicell™
hanging cell culture inserts (polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) membranes with 8 μm pores) (Millipore).
For the transwell migration assay, 2 x 105 cells were
plated in serum-free medium containing 50 ng/ml
EGF (Invitrogen) or 10 μM PGE2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and
placed in the upper chamber for 15 h, while the lower
chamber was filled with serum-free medium with or
without 50 ng/ml EGF. The cells in the upper chamber
were removed and the migrated cells at the bottom of the
PET membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. For the invasion

assay, 2 x 105 cells were plated in serum-free medium
containing 50 ng/ml EGF or 10 μM PGE2 and placed in
the upper chamber on a 10% Matrigel-coated membrane,
while the lower chamber was filled with serum-free
medium. After incubation for 48 h, the cells in the
upper chamber were removed and the invaded cells
at the bottom of the PET membrane were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal
violet. In both assays, the number of invading cells was
determined in three randomly chosen fields under the
microscope for three independent experiments.

The invasion assay was performed using Millicell™
hanging cell culture inserts (polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) membranes with 8 μm pores) (Millipore). HMEC1 cells (1 x 105 cells per well) were plated on the upper
chamber and allowed to grow to confluence, and then
10% Matrigel was loaded into the chamber. Tumor cells
were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF or 10 μM PGE2 in serumfree medium and then stained with 1,1′-dioctadecyl3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)
(Invitrogen) for 30 min. DiI-stained tumor cells (2 x 105)
were then loaded into the chamber, which was filled with
serum-free medium, and incubated for 2 days. Cells on
the apical side of each insert were scraped off. Invasion
to the basolateral side of the membrane was visualized
using an immunofluorescent microscope. The number
of invading cells was determined in three randomly
chosen fields under the microscope for three independent
experiments.
