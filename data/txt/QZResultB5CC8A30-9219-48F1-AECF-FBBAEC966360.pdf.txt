ABSTRACT:
Ovarian serous carcinoma is a highly aggressive neoplastic disease in women. Our
previous studies have demonstrated Notch3 gene amplification and upregulation in
many ovarian serous carcinomas and Notch pathway activity contributed to drug
resistance. Among different Notch3 ligands, Jagged1 is most dominant in ovarian
cancer, and Notch3 pathway activity correlated with Jagged1 expression level in
ovarian carcinoma tissues. In this study, we found that Jagged1 expression depended
on Notch3 pathway activation. Knockdown of either Notch3 or RBPjk, a Notchinteracting transcription factor critical in Notch signaling, suppressed Jagged1
expression in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, Jagged1 expression was upregulated in
human ovarian surface epithelial cells after ectopic expression of Notch3 intracellular
domain and was upregulated in mouse epithelial cells isolated from Notch3-inducible
mice after induction. We also found that inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
reduced Jagged1 expression, and co-administration of shRNAs targeting both Notch3
and β-catenin reduced Jagged1 expression much more than targeting either
individual gene. Taken together, our data suggested a positive regulatory loop
between Notch3 and its ligand, Jagged1, in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, Wnt/βcatenin pathway activation also up-regulated Jagged1. Both mechanisms may sustain
Notch3 signaling in ovarian cancer cells and contribute to the pathogenesis of ovarian
carcinoma.

that mediate the ultimate functions of a specific
pathway. However, aberrant activation of these
signaling pathways may confer an advantage to tumor
cells for growth in the host environment. The role of an
aberrant Notch signaling pathway in human cancer is
well illustrated in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia
(T-ALL). Activating point mutations occur in more
than 50% of T-ALL cases, and interstitial deletions of
the extracellular portion of human Notch1 occur in
another 10% due to chromosomal translocation [2, 3].

INTRODUCTION
Signaling pathways that are fundamental to
development and tissue differentiation are usually
found to participate in the pathogenesis of human
cancer [1]. For example, Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, and
TGF-β pathways were found to play critical roles in
both processes. These pathways involve ligandreceptor interactions which initiate signal transduction
that results in modulation of a set of downstream genes

ovarian carcinoma. We observed a significant
correlation between Jagged1 expression and nuclear
localization of the intracellular cytoplasmic domain of
Notch3 (NICD3) in ovarian serous carcinoma tissues
[8]. Moreover, we found that in ovarian cancer cells,
Notch3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with Jagged1
[8], and ectopic expression of NICD3 could partly
rescue the growth-inhibitory effect produced by
Jagged1 withdrawal [8]. These findings suggested a
critical role for Jagged1-Notch3 signaling in supporting
the growth and progression of ovarian cancer. While
molecular genetic changes such as translocation and
activating mutations provide the mechanism for
constitutively activating the Notch pathway, it is not
known how overexpression of Notch due to gene
amplification or epigenetic upregulation sustains
pathway activation. In the absence of structural
alterations, increased protein levels of receptor alone
may not necessarily enhance overall signaling activity
unless the cognate ligand is also overexpressed. Based
on our previous studies, we hypothesized that cell-cell
contacts between adjacent ovarian cancer cells elicit
Notch3 signaling which in turn upregulates its ligand,

Those molecular genetic alterations result in the
dysregulated expression of an oncogenic intracellular
form of Notch1 [4].
By analyzing genome-wide DNA copy number
changes in primary ovarian serous carcinoma, the most
aggressive type of gynecologic cancer [5], we have
identified a relatively frequent amplification located on
chr19p13.12, which harbors Notch3 [6]. We have
focused on characterizing this gene because, as
compared to other co-amplified genes, Notch3 mRNA
was most significantly up-regulated in amplified
tumors. Notch3 (mRNA as well as protein) was found
to be over-expressed in more than 50% of high-grade
tumors as compared to ovarian surface epithelium.
Recently, we have demonstrated that Notch3
expression is associated with recurrence postchemotherapy, probably as a result of upregulation of
an ATP-dependent transporter gene, ABCB1, and
several embryonic stem cell markers [7].
In order to determine which Notch ligand was most
prevalent in ovarian cancer, we employed gene
expression profiling of all known Notch ligands and
found that Jagged1 was the primary Notch3 ligand in

and OVCAR3 and OVMANA ovarian cancer cell lines
were used because both cell lines expressed abundant
endogenous Notch3 and Jagged1. Transfection of both
OVCAR3 and OVMANA with Notch3 specific
shRNAs resulted in a decrease in the transcript level of
Notch3, Hes1 (an established Notch regulated gene),
and Jagged1. Similarly, Western blot analysis
demonstrated that Notch3 shRNAs robustly suppressed
protein expression of Jagged1 as well as Notch3. The
results from a representative shRNA are shown in
Figure 1. To confirm that blocking expression of
Notch3 is the main cause for the reduced Jagged1
expression, we used two additional approaches. First,
we employed shRNAs targeting RBPjk, a gene that is
critical in regulating transcription activity of the Notch
signaling pathway, and second, we applied gamma
secretase inhibitor (GSI), which blocks cleavage of
Notch3, thus preventing generation of NICD3. RBPjk
shRNA treatment decreased the expression of Jagged1
at both transcript and protein levels in ovarian cancer
cells (Fig. 2A). Moreover, cell growth was

Jagged1, thus maintaining long-term Notch3 signaling
in cancer cells.
To test this hypothesis, we used both reverse and
forward approaches, based on gene knockdown and
ectopic expression systems, respectively, to
demonstrate that Notch3 signaling can regulate
expression levels of its own ligand, Jagged1.
Furthermore, because the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has
been shown to affect Jagged1 expression in hair
follicles [9], we also determined if Jagged1 could be
regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in ovarian
cancer cells.
RESULTS
To demonstrate whether Notch3 signaling is
essential for Jagged1 expression, we compared Jagged1
mRNA and protein levels between ovarian cancer cells
transfected with Notch3 specific shRNAs and control
shRNA. Different ovarian cancer cell lines were tested,

sufficient to upregulate Jagged1 expression. First,
IOSE80pc, a cell line derived from normal ovarian
surface epithelium, was transfected with NICD3
retrovirus. This cell line represents the benign
counterpart of ovarian carcinoma and expresses an
undetectable level of NICD3. As shown in Figure 3A,
IOSE-80pc cells transduced with NICD3 retrovirus
expressed abundant NICD3 and expressed a
significantly higher level of Jagged1 protein than the
cells transduced with control virus. In addition, we also
observed an increase in the expression of Jagged1 CTF,
the activated form of Jagged1 in NICD3-transduced
cells as compared to control virus-transduced cells. We
further used Notch3 knockin mice to support the above
findings. The Cre/Lox Notch3 knockin mouse was
generated by inserting a Cre/Lox construct carrying
full-length human Notch3 into the Rosa26 locus (Fig.
4A). Primary cultures of ovarian surface epithelial
(OSE) and fallopian tube (FT) epithelial cells were
established from the Notch3 knockin mouse. When
Notch3 expression was induced after Ad-Cre infection
(Fig 4C & D), we found that Jagged1 transcript and
protein level were elevated as compared to the same
cells infected with Ade-GFP control virus. The
expression of a Notch3 target gene, Hes1, was also
elevated in cells with induced Notch3 expression,
indicating that the Notch signaling pathway was
elevated.
Because the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has
been reported to affect the expression of Jagged1 in
hair follicles [9], we determined if this effect occurred
in cancer cells. shRNAs targeting β-catenin and TCF-4
were used to inactivate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in
OVCAR3 cells. As shown in Figure 5, the shRNAs
effectively reduced the transcript levels of β-catenin
and TCF-4, respectively. More importantly, Jagged1
and
several
well-established
Wnt
regulated
downstream genes including CCND1, SOX9, and
CD44 were also found to be downregulated. Next, we
knocked down both Notch3 and β-catenin in OVCAR3
cells and found that this reduced the Jagged1 transcript
level significantly more than knockdown of either
Notch1 or β-catenin alone at the same concentration of
shRNA plasmid (p<0.001) (Fig. 6). Similarly, cell
proliferation and colony formation potency in cells
transduced by both Notch3 shRNA and β-catenin
shRNA were significantly reduced compared to cells
transduced by either of shRNA virus alone (p<0.001,
Fig. 6 B&C).

significantly decreased in cells transfected with RBPjk
shRNA (Fig. 2B), a result similar to that obtained by
inactivating the Notch3 pathway using Notch3 gene
knockdown and GSI [6]. GSI treatment also
significantly reduced the transcript levels of Jagged1
and Hes1, a well-known target gene of Notch receptor
(supplementary Fig. 1). These results provide evidence
that Notch3 signaling activity regulates Jagged1
expression in ovarian cancer cells. In contrast, we did
not observe a significant effect on the expression level
of Notch3 by knocking down Jagged1, suggesting a
“one-way” regulatory loop between Notch3 and
Jagged1 in ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 2C).
Next, using two independent approaches, we asked
whether activation of the Notch3 pathway was

study have several biological implications relevant to
the study of the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.
Using multiple approaches, including gene
knockdown in ovarian cancer cells, ectopic expression
in human OSE cells and induced Notch3 expression in
mouse OSE and fallopian tube cells, we demonstrated
that Notch3 signaling was essential and sufficient to
upregulate Jagged1 expression. Although Notch
signaling has been reported to increase levels of
Jagged1 in NIH3T3 cells [10], the current report is the
first to demonstrate that a similar phenomenon occurs
in cancer cells. The biological significance of a
Jagged1/Notch3 positive auto-regulatory loop in cancer
cells is open to question. It is well-known that Notch
signaling is involved in embryonic organ development
and adult tissue differentiation/regeneration [11].
Studies from C. elegans and Drosophila suggest a role
of Notch signaling in lateral inhibition or lateral
specification. For example, during sensory organ
development, precursor cells express both Notch
receptor and its ligand Delta in the same cells;
however, in adult tissue, Notch receptor and ligand are
expressed by different tissue types [12]. In the
tumorigenesis of human cancer, findings by us and
others have demonstrated that a significant number of
ovarian, prostate, and lung carcinomas co-express both
Notch receptor and ligand [8, 13, 14]. This indicates
either that tumor is derived from a small number of
precursor cells which co-express both Notch receptor
and ligand, or that during tumor development cancer
cells may deregulate the tight control of gene
expression to permit expression of both Notch receptor
and ligand in the same cell. Nevertheless, a positive
auto-regulatory loop supports co-expression of Notch
and its ligand is likely to amplify or sustain Notch3
signaling activation, thus providing a long-term
survival advantage for tumor cells. Because Jagged1
has been known to participate in vascular development
[15], it would be interesting to determine if this
positive regulatory loop in cancer cells is also involved
in promoting vasculogenesis in the tumor
microenvironment.
This report also demonstrated that the Wnt/βcatenin pathway may serve as a second pathway to
ensure robust expression of Jagged1 in some ovarian
serous carcinomas. Evidence that the Wnt signaling
pathway regulates Jagged1 expression has been
reported previously in progenitor cells and in colorectal
cancer cells [16, 17]. Jagged1 was shown to be a direct
target gene of β-catenin/TCF. The Jagged1 promoter
contains two TCF consensus binding sites, and specific

amplification is detected in the Notch3 locus but not in
the Jagged1 locus. Furthermore, we also demonstrated
that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was essential to
regulate Jagged1 expression, indicating that Jagged1
expression is regulated by at least two signaling
pathways in ovarian carcinoma. The results from this

binding of β-catenin to this locus was demonstrated by
ChIP. In findings similar to ours, suppressing the Wnt
signaling pathway by dominant-negative TCF or small
molecular inhibitor for β-catenin results in reduced
Jagged1 expression. Our findings further suggest that
regulation of Jagged1 expression by Wnt signaling is
probably a common phenomena shared by most
epithelial cancer cells.
Ovarian cancer has dual signaling pathways to
control Jagged1 expression indicates the importance of
maintaining active Notch signaling in epithelial cancer
cells. In addition, the regulation of Jagged1 expression
by both Wnt/β-catenin and Notch3 pathways may have
a biological effect beyond being engaged in activating
Notch3 pathway. Jagged1 may have signaling
functions that are independent of the canonical Notch
pathway. It has been demonstrated that upon binding to
Notch receptor, Jagged1 is sequentially processed by αand γ-secretase, leading to the release of the nuclear
signaling fragment of Jagged1 [18, 19]. Similar to
Notch, the soluble Jagged1 intracellular fragment
translocates into the nucleus and activates gene
expression via the transcription factor AP1 [18]. The
putative Notch-independent role for Jagged1 in human
neoplasms is not clear, and our results did not
demonstrate that Jagged1 upregulation affected the
expression level of Notch3, suggesting that the autoregulatory loop was “one way”—from Notch3 to
Jagged1. Interestingly, we observed that the Jagged1
intracellular domain fragment increased much more
than did total Jagged1 in OSE cells after transduction
with NICD3. Further investigation into the function of
the Jagged1 intracellular domain fragment will be
necessary to delineate any putative Notch-independent
function of Jagged1 in cancer cells.
In summary, this study provides evidence for a dual
regulation of Jagged1 expression by Wnt and Notch
signaling pathways in ovarian cancers. These results
suggest that combinatorial therapy targeting both
Notch and Wnt pathways may prove to be more
effective than a single agent for treatment of epithelial
cancers.
