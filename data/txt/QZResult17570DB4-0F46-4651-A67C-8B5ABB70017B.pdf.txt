BACKGROUND: To identify potential genetic markers for severe oxaliplatin-induced chronic peripheral neuropathy
(OXCPN), the authors performed a genome-wide association analysis of patients with colon cancer who received
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: This was a prospective study in which DNA was purified in peripheral
blood from patients with colon cancer who received oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint was the development of severe
(grade 2 lasting for >7 days or grade 3) OXCPN. For the discovery set, genotyping was done for 96 patients who
received adjuvant fluorouracil and oxaliplatin using the a genome-wide human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
array. An association between polymorphisms and severe OXCPN was investigated. At the same time, 247 patients
who received oxaliplatin-based, first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease were enrolled as a validation set.
RESULTS: Among the 32 genotyped candidate SNPs selected from the discovery set, 9 SNPs in 8 genes (tachykinin,
precursor 1[TAC1]; forkhead box C1 [FOXC1]; integrin, alpha 1 [ITGA1]; acylphosphatase 2, muscle type [ACYP2];
deleted in lymphocytic leukemia, 7 [DLEU7]; B-cell translocation gene 4 [BTG4]; calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1 [CAMK2N1]; and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase 2 [FARS2]) had nominal replication (P < .05).
The most significant association was observed at reference SNP number (rs)10486003 in TAC1 (P Â¼ 4.84  107) in
combined data from 2 sets. Five SNPs (rs10486003, rs2338, rs830884, rs843748, and rs797519) were significant in a
multiple regression analysis (P < .05). Overall prediction accuracy calculated by the regression model was 72.8%
(95% confidence interval, 65.8%-79.9%) in the model development and 75.9% (95% confidence interval, 66.9%-84.9%)
in the model evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that a genome-wide pharmacogenomic
approach is useful for identifying novel polymorphism predictors of severe OXCPN that may be used in personalized

INTRODUCTION
The mainstay of first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) is a chemotherapy regimen combining oxaliplatin or irinotecan with fluoropyrimidine with or without leucovorin (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, respectively).1 In addition
to the activity and safety reported with first-line FOLFOX,2,3 the regimen has been approved in the adjuvant setting.4 The
most common and problematic toxicity of oxaliplatin is cumulative peripheral neuropathy.5 The risk factors for

SNP Markers for Oxaliplatin Neuropathy/Won et al

developing oxaliplatin-induced chronic peripheral neurotoxicity (OXCPN) includes treatment schedule, time of
infusion, dose of oxaliplatin, and pre-existing peripheral
neuropathy.6
In addition to efforts to identify clinical characteristics predictive for OXCPN, studies have been done to establish the role of various genetic markers for OXCPN.
Optimization of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy depends
on patient selection, and the exploration of predictive
genetic markers for the incidence or severity is important.
Lecomte et al. indicated a significant correlation between
the glutathione S-transferase p1 (GSTP1) polymorphism
and oxaliplatin-related cumulative neurotoxicity.7 However, other researchers reported contradicting results with
regard to the association of GSTP1 with neurotoxicity.8,9
Previous studies have focused on a limited number of
candidate genes that are involved in specific biologic functions or processes to identify genetic polymorphisms
associated with platinum drug sensitivity or resistance.
The genes involved in several mechanisms, such as mismatch-repair genes (human mutL homolog 1 [hMLH1],
hMLH2, human postmeiotic segregation 2 [hPMS2],
human mutH 2 [hMSH2], hMSH3, and hMSH6), replicative bypass, base excision repair (XRCC1), nucleotide
excision repair (ERCC1 and ERCC2), GSTP1, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were the main candidates in previous studies.9,10 However, an association
between SNPs of the genes and platinum drug response
was not consistently replicated.11
With the recent advance in molecular genotyping
technology, the genotyping of hundreds of SNPs enables
us to examine genetic differences in individual patients
with regard to drug response or side effects. In the current
study, we performed a genome-wide association (GWA)
analysis in a cohort of patients with colon cancer who
received oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy to
identify the SNPs associated with severe OXCPN. After
validating the significant SNPs selected from the GWA
analysis, we evaluated those polymorphisms as genetic
predictors for predicting severe OXCPN.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
In the current prospective study, we recorded the incidence
and severity of OXCPN in all consecutive patients with stage
II through IV colon cancer who received oxaliplatin-based
combination chemotherapy (National Clinical Trial
NCT00977717; available at: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov;

accessed September 30, 2011). Full details of the current
study have been published previously.12 This study was
approved by the institutional review board, and all patients
provided written informed consent before registration.
In an adjuvant setting, we used a modified FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 intravenously on
day 1, leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, and
fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus on day 1
followed by 2400 mg/m2 intravenously over 46 hours). In
the first-line setting, the treating physician determined
chemotherapy (ie, either oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 plus capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/d on days
1-14 [XELOX] repeated every 3 weeks or FOLFOX) for
each patient. Adjuvant FOLFOX was repeated every 2 weeks
until recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, a patient chose to
discontinue treatment, or a maximum of 12 cycles.
Clinical Evaluation of Neurotoxicity
Patients were followed on day 1 of each chemotherapy
cycle. OXCPN was evaluated and rated in accordance
with National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria (Common
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3; NCI,
Bethesda, Md). In addition to subjective assessment of
OXCPN, we performed a short, standardized neurologic
examination that included the testing of exteroceptive
sensation in hands and feet and testing of proprioceptive
sensation. Dose modifications were performed based on
the laboratory test results and the degree of nonhematologic adverse events observed during the preceding cycle.
In particular, oxaliplatin was reduced for episodes of
prolonged (7 days) grade 2 OXCPN or temporary (<7
days) grade 3 OXCPN. Chemotherapy was delayed up to
a maximum of 2 weeks for episodes of grade 2 OXCPN.
For episodes of persistent (14 days) grade 2 OXCPN
or functional impairment, oxaliplatin was omitted from
the regimen until recovery. Analgesics, with or without
antiepileptics, could be given to those with severe
OXCPN at the discretion of investigators.
Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Genotyping
Before the initiation of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, a
venous blood sample in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
was collected from the registered patients. SNP genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide
Human SNP Array 6.0, which includes more than
906,600 SNPs (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif).
Before genotyping, we determined yields of pure doublestrand genomic DNA samples using the Wizard Genomic
DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, Wis). Samples

2829

Original Article

were normalized to 50 ng/lL, and normalized genomic
DNA (5 lL) from each sample was used as a template for
the Affymetrix 6.0 assays. Genotyping reactions were performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP
Nsp/Sty 5.0/6.0 kit reagents and protocols. Genotypes
were called according to the Birdseed algorithm of the
Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 3.0.2. All procedures were done according to recommended protocols of
the manufacturer. After excluding 12,174 SNPs with a
call rate <95% and 213,401 SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) <1%, 656,843 autosomal SNPs were analyzed. The call rate for all discovery samples was >97%.
Candidate validation SNPs that were selected from the
discovery analysis and 7 previously reported SNPs were
genotyped in the validation sample using the MassARRAY system (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, Calif). These 7
SNPs included reference SNP (rs)11615 and rs3212986
in ERCC1, rs13181 and rs179993 in ERCC2, rs1695 in
GSTP1, rs2298771 in sodium channel protein brain 1
subunit alpha [SCN1A], and rs25487 in XRCC1. Among
the 247 validation samples, 3 samples were excluded
because of missing genotype (call rate, <80%). Genotype
concordance of duplicate samples in the validation set was
>99%. Laboratory personnel were blinded to clinical
data, and the genotyping results were not available for
investigators during treatment.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this study was the development
of severe OXCPN, which was defined a priori as prolonged (7 days) grade 2 or grade 3 in the protocol. No
formal assumption was made to calculate sample size,
because there had been no similar reports involving GWA
analysis. An association between each SNP and severe
OXCPN occurrence was tested using an allelic test with
the Fisher exact test. SNPs with a P value <1  104 in
the discovery result were selected for validation. For each
of the selected SNPs, we also performed a permutation
test, randomly swapping 10,000 of the class labels to evaluate the statistical significance given the limited sample
size. We removed SNPs that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the validation analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to select significant
predictors among the SNPs that had significant associations. Prediction probability was estimated by multiple
logistic regression. For predicting severe OXCPN occurrence, we used the operational criteria of P > .6 for
predicting occurrence and P < .4 for predicting no occurrence. Samples with P values between .4 and .6 were con-

2830

sidered unpredictive to avoid inaccurate classification by
the borderline effect. All statistical analyses were conducted
using the software packages PLINK version 1.0613 and R
(version 2.9.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria). Gene Ontology (GO) information was
retrieved from the Gene Ontology Annotation database.14

RESULTS
Patients and Treatment
Between January 2008 and February 2010, 100 patients
in the discovery set and 266 patients in the validation set
were registered onto the study. Of all 100 patients in the
discovery set, 4 were excluded in the final analyses because
of early discontinuation of chemotherapy (ie, they discontinued during or after the first cycle). In the validation set,
19 patients were excluded because of early discontinuation or consent withdrawal, and 247 patients were
included in the analyses. Detailed characteristics of the
patients are listed in Table 1.
The median cumulative dose of oxaliplatin was 935
mg/m2 (range, 510-1020 mg/m2) in the validation set
and 899 mg/m2 (range, 500-1583 mg/m2) in the discovery set. Severe OXCPN was observed in 39 patients
(41%) and 85 patient s(34%) the discovery set and the
validation set, respectively. We observed no significant
association between baseline clinical characteristics and
the development of severe OXCPN.12 In addition, neither the cumulative oxaliplatin dose nor treatment duration affected the incidence of severe OXCPN.
Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Associated
With Severe Neuropathy
From the GWA analysis of the 96 discovery samples, 20
distinct loci (comprising 38 SNPs) were detected that had
a P value < 1.0  104 (Fig. 1). The 38 SNPs were genotyped in the validation set, and 6 SNPs were excluded
because of a low call rate. In addition, 5 SNPs were
removed in further analyses because they deviated from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the validation set
(P < .05). Among these 27 candidate SNPs, 9 SNPs
exhibited nominal replication (P < .05) (Table 2). Genotype results from the 9 SNPs generated in the discovery
set were validated using the MassARRAY system (genotype concordance, >98%).These 9 SNPs also were statistically significant in the permutation test with 10,000
randomly swapped class labels, indicating that the association of the SNPs given the tested samples was significant.

rs17140129, and rs6924717 were the smallest in the distribution of permuted P values, and those of other SNPs
were within the top 0.05%. The most significant association was observed for rs10486003 with a combined GWA
and validation P value of 4.84  107. This SNP is
located upstream of TAC1. MAF distribution patterns of
the 9 SNPs were similar between the discovery set and
the validation set; thus, associations also were significant
in the combined set. P values of the most significant 3
SNPs, rs10486003 (TAC1), rs2338 (forkhead box C1
[FOXC1]), and rs830884 (integrin alpha 1 [ITGA1])
were decreased by 1 order of magnitude in combining the
2 data sets (P < 1.0  106). Four SNPs had higher MAF
in the group with severe OXCPN than in the control
group, resulting in high odds ratios (ORs) with a 95%
confidence interval (CI) >1. The remaining 5 SNPs had
the opposite MAF distribution, ie, low MAF in the

affected group. The 7 previously reported SNPs (rs11615
and rs3212986 in ERCC1, rs13181 and rs179993 in
ERCC2, rs1695 in GSTP1, rs2298771 in SCN1A, and
rs25487 in XRCC1) had no association with severe
OXCPN in the validation set.
Prediction Model for Severe Neuropathy
Occurrence
The prediction probabilities were calculated by multiple
logistic regression analysis using severe OXCPN occurrence as the dependent variable and the replicated SNPs as
the independent variables. Clinical variables were not
included in the model, because there was no significant
association between baseline clinical characteristics and
the incidence of severe OXCPN. Moreover, because 2
SNPs, rs17140129 and rs6924717, were in complete
linkage disequilibrium (r2 Â¼ 1), only rs17140129 was

included in the regression model. Five SNPs
(rs10486003, rs2338, rs830884, rs843748, and
rs797519) were significant in the multiple logistic regression analysis (P < .05). Among the 206 tested samples,
excluding the 41 samples that were missing genotypes, 55
samples with a probability between .4 and .6 were considered unpredictive. The model yielded an overall prediction accuracy of 72.8% (110 of 151 samples; 95% CI,
65.8%-79.9%) for the predicted 151 samples (Table 3).
The positive predictive value of the model was 70.6% (24
of 34 samples; 95% CI, 55.3%-85.9%), and the negative
predictive value was 73.5% (86 of 117 samples; 95% CI,
65.5%-81.5%). Sensitivity and specificity were 43.6%
(24 of 55 samples; 95% CI, 30.5%-56.7%) and 89.6%
(86 of 96 samples; 95% CI, 83.5%-95.7%), respectively.
When the model was tested for the whole population,
including the unpredictive 55 samples, the area under the
receiver characteristics curve of the model was 0.72.
Detailed genotype combinations of 5 polymorphisms of
the prediction model are summarized in Table 4.
To evaluate the model, we tested prediction performance using the discovery set (n Â¼ 96), which was not
included in the model development. The model could
predict severe OXCPN occurrence for 87 of 96 samples
(90.6%; the remaining 9 samples had a probability
between .4 and .6) and also had good prediction performance (Table 3). The overall accuracy was 75.9% (66 of 87

2832

samples; 95% CI, 66.9%-84.9%). The positive and negative predictive values were 86.4% (19 of 22 samples; 95%
CI, 72%-100%) and 85.5% (47 of 55 samples; 95% CI,
76.1%-94.8%), respectively. Sensitivity was 70.4% (19 of
27 samples; 95% CI, 53.1%-87.6%), and specificity was
94% (47 of 50 samples; 95% CI, 87.4%-100%). The area
under the receiver characteristics curve for the model that
included the 9 unpredictive samples was 0.88.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we identified several polymorphisms
associated with severe OXCPN in 2 independent data
sets, and we also evaluated these polymorphisms as potential predictive markers. Five SNPs (rs10486003, rs2338,
rs830884, rs843748, and rs797519) were significant in
the multiple regression analysis (P < .05). The overall predictive accuracy calculated by the regression model was
72.8% (95% CI, 65.8%-79.9%) in the model development and 75.9% (95% CI, 66.9%-84.9%) in the model
evaluation. Our samples have strength in terms of an ethnically homogeneous population and a well controlled
phenotype, because they were collected prospectively in a
single institute. Most patients did not have chemotherapy-related symptoms before study entry. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to examine a genetic
association with severe OXCPN on a genome-wide scale,

and our findings suggest many plausible candidate genes
with regard to biologic relevance in the development of
neurotoxicity.
The patients in our study received a remarkable
amount of oxaliplatin. Given the large doses, it is understandable than clinicians and patients are concerned about
the bothersome side effects of oxaliplatin.12 OXCPN is
recognized as a complaint that can particularly affect quality of life. It is noteworthy that some patients discontinued treatment because of severe OXCPN rather than
tumor progression. Once developed, the treatment for
severe OXCPN includes only conservative measures,
including dose reduction and/or delay, analgesics, or the
avoidance of cold.
Patients who receive anticancer chemotherapy exhibit variation in terms of both treatment outcome and

the incidence and severity of toxicities. The genetic variants
that contribute to the variation in susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced activity and toxicity can be identified with
pharmacogenetic and genomic studies.7,9 Although these
studies are beginning to point to some potential pharmacogenomic markers of OXCPN, they have not yielded conclusive findings that have allowed for the identification of
patients who are at risk of this toxicity.

It was noted previously that several genes of the
replicated SNPs in Table 2 are related to various neuronal
activities. The alpha 1 subunit of integrin receptor protein
encoded by ITGA1 heterodimerizes with the beta 1 subunit and forms a cell-surface receptor for collagen and laminin. Collagen VI (COL6A3) and ITGA1 reportedly were
overexpressed in an oxaliplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line.15 In terms of GO, this gene is related to

receptor activity that initiates a change in cell activity, positive regulation of neuron apoptosis (such as a prolongation or process extending from a nerve cell), and muscle
contraction.16 These processes are related to symptoms of
neuropathy, such as a prolonged muscular contraction
and sensory ataxia. In addition, it is known that the TAC1
gene encodes 4 hormone products (substance P, neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide c) that may
function as neurotransmitters and that interact with nerve
receptors and smooth muscle cells. Similarly, TAC1 is
linked to GO the terms cell-cell signaling, neuropeptide
signaling pathway, positive regulation of action potential,
positive regulation of synaptic transmission (c-aminobutyric
acid [GABA]ergic and cholinergic), axon, and neuronal
cell body. The B-cell translocation gene 4 (BTG4) also is
linked to the GO term neuron differentiation.17
The FOXC1 gene is related to neural crest cell development and has an interaction with high-mobility group
box 1 (HMGB1), which is involved in base-excision
repair, DNA ligation, and DNA repair.18-20 Acylphosphatase 2, muscle type (ACYP2) is involved in pyruvate
metabolism. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II inhibitor 1 (CAMK2N1) is associated with many
GO terms, including calcium-dependent protein kinase
inhibitor activity, cell junction, neuronal cell body, postsynaptic density, postsynaptic membrane, synapse, and synaptosome. Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial
(FARS2) is related to magnesium ion binding. These
genes may account for the mechanism of neurotoxicity
prevention by calcium-magnesium infusions or may be
associated with the important oxalate and glyoxylate outcome pathway.21
Although none of the SNPs in the GWA surpassed
genome-wide significance, and the P values of the replicated SNPs corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling for the false-discovery rate were not significant in
the validation set (P Â¼ .05-.19), this limitation may be
overcome by increasing the sample size in a prospective
analysis. For SNPs that had no genome-wide significance
in previous pharmacogenomics studies, for example,
subsequent studies with larger cohorts demonstrated
genome-wide significance.22 In particular, this expectation can be supported by results from the permutation
test, which considered sample structure and size, and by
the observation of increased significance in the combined
data from the discovery and validation sets. None of the 7
SNPs that were studied previously in candidate gene studies (rs11615, rs3212986, rs13181, rs179993, rs1695,
rs2298771, and rs25487) were replicated in the validation

set. This also was observed in another study with a candidate gene approach in which several candidate genes,
including ERCC1, ERCC2, and XRCC1, had no reproducible associations with toxicity after chemotherapy with platinum and taxane.11 Inconsistent associations possibly were
attributable to difference in phenotype definition, drug
class, and/or ethnic genetic background or to limited effects
on neuropathy of the previously described candidate genes.
In addition, when we built a prediction model in the
discovery set without validating the SNPs that were
included in the model and evaluated the model in the validation set, we observed that the predictive accuracy was
slightly decreased (overall accuracy Â¼ 65.4%; 95% CI,
58.7%-72.2%). This observation indicates that the SNPs
included in the prediction model need to be replicated
before model construction. Taken together, the replicated
SNPs may be useful as genetic predictors; however,
further validation of the proposed prediction model in
independent sets is required.
Because the replicated SNPs were located in introns
of genes or within 100 Kb of the neighbor genes, fine
mapping may be required to detect causal variants in further analyses; and, subsequently, the inclusion of causal
variants in a prediction model will increase predictive performance. Nevertheless, the prediction model performed
successfully not only in the model development and but
also in the model evaluation, although it did not use clinical information but only used genetic information.
Because genetic information has no time-dependent variability, a validated model based on genetic information
would enable stable the prediction of OXCPN before oxaliplatin treatment.
In conclusion, the genes that were identified in this
study may be promising, novel candidates that may be
involved in genetic mechanisms underlying sensitivity to
the toxicity of oxaliplatin. The significant SNPs identified
could be used as genetic predictors for severe OXCPN
occurrence in a clinical setting through further prospective
validation with a large sample size.
