Abstract
Induction of premature senescence may be a promising
strategy for cancer treatment. However, biomarkers for
senescent cancer cells are lacking. To identify such biomarkers, we performed comparative proteomic analysis of
MCF7 human breast cancer cells undergoing cellular senescence in response to ionizing radiation (IR). IR-induced
senescence was associated with up-regulation of cathepsin D
(CD) and down-regulation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1B2 (eEF1B2), as confirmed by Western blot. The
other elongation factor, eukaryotic translation elongation
factor 1A1 (eEF1A1), was also down-regulated. IR-induced
senescence was associated with similar changes of CD and
eEF1 (eEF1A1 and eEF1B2) levels in the HCT116 colon cancer
cell line and the H460 lung cancer cell line. Up-regulation of
CD and down-regulation of eEF1 seemed to be specific to
senescence, as they were observed during cellular senescence
induced by hydrogen peroxide or anticancer drugs (camptothecin, etoposide, or 50 ng doxorubicin) but not during
apoptosis induced by Taxol or 10 Mg doxorubicin or autophagy
induced by tamoxifen. The same alterations in CD and eEF1A1
levels were observed during replicative senescence and Ras
oncogene-induced senescence. Transient cell cycle arrest did
not alter levels of eEF1 or CD. Chemical inhibition of CD
(pepstatin A) and small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown
of CD and eEF1 revealed that these factors participate in cell
proliferation. Finally, the senescence-associated alteration in
CD and eEF1 levels observed in cell lines was also observed in
IR-exposed xenografted tumors. These findings show that CD
and eEF1 are promising markers for the detection of cellular
senescence induced by a variety of treatments. [Cancer Res
2009;69(11):4638–47]

because a variety of treatments have been shown to trigger cellular
senescence. The activated ras or raf oncogenes trigger senescence
in normal cells, and low doses of DNA-damaging agents, including
ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutic drugs, induce senescent
phenotypes in cancer cells (3–6). Accumulating evidences suggest
that apoptosis may not be the exclusive or even the primary
mechanism underlying loss of self-renewal capacity in IR- or drugtreated cancer cells (5–7). Recent studies suggest that induction of
premature senescence is a promising treatment for solid tumors (8, 9).
The characteristic phenotypes of premature senescence are
abundant in premalignant neoplastic lesions (10). Premature
senescence is not only a barrier to tumorigenesis but also a
hallmark of premalignant tumors (10, 11). Therefore, senescence
markers could be useful diagnostic and prognostic tools (12). The
most commonly used senescence biomarker is senescenceassociated h-galactosidase (SA-h-Gal; ref. 2). Senescence-associated
heterochromatic foci are also considered senescence markers (12).
However, these markers have the disadvantage of being unable to
be detected using standard immunohistochemical methods.
Recently, DNA microarray analysis identified the oncogene-induced
premature senescence markers p15INK4b, DCR2, and DEC1 (10).
However, senescence markers in action are still a few. Therefore,
additional specific markers of premature senescence that have
diagnostic and prognostic value await identification.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy, major regimens of cancer
treatment, recently have been proved to induce premature
senescence (5–7). The aim of this study was to identify and
validate useful biomarkers for the detection of cellular senescence
using comparative proteomic analysis. Here, we provide evidence
that eukaryotic elongation factor 1 (eEF1) and cathepsin D (CD)
are reliable markers of cellular senescence.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Cellular senescence was originally described in normal human
cells undergoing a finite number of divisions before permanent
growth arrest (1). Cells undergoing such replicative senescence are
metabolically active and exhibit distinct morphologic changes and
phenotypic markers (2). Cellular senescence has recently become
regarded as a general biological program of terminal growth arrest

cells, we analyzed clonogenicity and SA-h-Gal activity in MCF7
human breast cancer cells exposed to various doses of IR (Fig. 1A).
An IR dose of 6 Gy effectively arrested cell proliferation and
induced cellular senescence. Over 4 days after irradiation, cells
exhibited a progressive increase in senescence-specific morphology,
as seen by a large, flat cellular shape and SA-h-Gal activity (Fig. 1A;

Supplementary Fig. S1). Western blot analysis revealed p53
activation, p21 induction, and loss of phospho-pRb at an early
stage of senescence (Fig. 1B). The cell cycle regulators CDK2, Cdc2,
cyclin A, and cyclin B were gradually decreased, whereas CDK4
and cyclin D were gradually increased. In all cases, these changes
were sustained for up to 4 days. Increased p21 could bind to

cyclin D1-CDK4 complex and proliferating cell nuclear antigen,
and resulted in G1 arrest (16, 17). Consistent with these results,
IR-treated cells underwent G1 arrest (data not shown), and
treatment-induced senescence was almost complete at 4 days
after irradiation.
Proteins undergoing level changes during IR-induced
senescence of MCF7 cells. To identify proteins undergoing level
changes during IR-induced senescence, comparative proteomic
analysis was performed in control cells and cells exhibiting
senescent phenotypes following exposure to 6 Gy IR. A representative 2-DE pattern is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Two protein
spots were reproducibly up-regulated or down-regulated during
IR-induced senescence. ESI-MS/MS analysis identified these factors
as chain B of CD and eEF1B2 (Supplementary Table S1).
Altered protein levels of CD and eEF1 during IR-induced or
chemotherapeutic drug–induced senescence. Western blot and
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were performed
to confirm that CD and eEF1B2 undergo expression changes in
IR-induced senescence. CD was up-regulated at the transcriptional
level, whereas eEF1B2 was down-regulated at the posttranscriptional level (Fig. 1C). Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1a1
(eEF1A1), other entity of elongation factors, was also downregulated at the posttranscriptional level. MCF7 control cells that
were incubated for 4 days without IR exposure were not positive for
SA-h-Gal. Moreover, they did not exhibit any alterations in cellular
morphology and in levels of CD or eEF1 (eEF1A1 and eEF1B2) or
sustained changes in levels of p53, p21, or phospho-pRb that were
indicative of prolonged cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1C). Differential levels
of CD and eEF1 were also confirmed in the H460 lung cancer cell
line and the HCT116 colon cancer cell line (Fig. 1D). In both cell
lines, CD protein was increased, whereas eEF1 proteins were
decreased. Next, we examined CD and eEF1 level changes in
response to other senescence-inducing chemotherapeutic drugs
(i.e., camptothecin and etoposide) and hydrogen peroxide (18–20).
These agents induced alterations in CD and eEF1 levels that were
consistent with those seen in IR-treated cells (Fig. 2A, a). To
determine whether CD and eEF1 alterations were p53 dependent,
we analyzed CD and eEF1 levels in IR (6 Gy)–exposed MDA-MB231
cells, which contain mutant p53 (21). These cells yielded consistent
results with cells expressing wild-type p53 (Fig. 2A, b).
CD up-regulation and eEF1 down-regulation are specific to
senescence, not apoptosis. Low doses of chemotherapeutic drug,
doxorubicin, induce cellular senescence in carcinoma cells (22, 23).
In contrast, high doses of this drug induce apoptosis (23). We
determined whether changes in CD and eEF1 protein levels differ
according to cell fate (i.e., senescence or apoptosis). At a low dose
(50 ng/mL), doxorubicin induced senescence-specific morphologic
changes and positive SA-h-Gal staining (Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Fig. S3). In these cells, decrease of phospho-pRb and accumulation
of p21 were accompanied by up-regulation of CD and downregulation of eEF1 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a high dose of doxorubicin
(10 Ag/mL) induced apoptosis-specific morphologic changes and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (apoptotic marker;
Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S3). Under these apoptotic conditions,
p21 was decreased due to caspase activation as already known.
Protein level of eEF1 remained unaltered, whereas CD was
gradually decreased. All these changes also occurred in cells
undergoing apoptosis in response to Taxol (paclitaxel; Fig. 2C, left).
Thus, CD and eEF1 are differentially regulated by senescence- or
apoptosis-specific signaling pathways. The distinct differences in
eEF1 and CD protein levels between apoptosis and senescence

www.aacrjournals.org

were confirmed in H460 cells (Fig. 2C, right). To determine if the
decreases in PARP and eEF1 associated with IR- or doxorubicininduced senescence are due to proteasomal degradation, we
treated MCF7 cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2D).
The results indicate that the proteasomal degradation pathway
does not contribute to decrease in PARP or eEF1.
Transient cell cycle arrest and autophagy do not induce CD
up-regulation and eEF1 down-regulation. Next, we investigated
the effect of transient cell cycle arrest on CD and eEF1 levels.
Transient arrest at G1-S phase was induced by double thymidine
block (DTB; ref. 24). G1-S phase transition arrest was evidenced by
a decrease in phospho-pRb and an accumulation in CDK2. DTB led
to an accumulation of p53 and p21. No significant alterations in
levels of CD and eEF1 were detected at arrested and released
conditions (Fig. 3A, left). The transience of cell cycle arrest was
confirmed by the counting of cell number (Fig. 3A, right).
Recently, autophagy has been reported to occur in several types
of cancer cells in response to radiation or chemotherapy (25).
Because autophagy could lead to growth arrest, a reduction in cell
number, and nonapoptotic death, we examined CD and eEF1
protein levels in cells undergoing tamoxifen-induced autophagy
(26). Autophagy was confirmed using the autophagy marker
LC3-II (Fig. 3B; ref. 27). Both CD and eEF1 were decreased under
these conditions (Fig. 3B), showing that senescence can be
distinguished from autophagy and apoptosis based on CD and
eEF1 protein levels.
To determine whether CD and eEF1 are relevant markers for
replicative or oncogene-induced senescence, we examined levels of
these proteins in young and old NHFs or H-rasV12–transfected HEFs.
CD was increased and eEF1A1 was decreased during both types of
senescence (Fig. 3C and D). However, eEF1B2 was increased in
oncogene-induced senescence and unchanged in replicative senescence (Fig. 3C and D). This indicates that eEF1A1 and eEF1B2
respond differently to senescence signals. These findings show that
CD and eEF1A1 are relevant markers for detecting a variety of types
of cellular senescence and that both markers are sufficient to
distinguish senescence from other cellular fates.
CD and eEF1 play critical roles in cell proliferation. To
understand whether changes in CD and eEF1 protein levels occur
as a result of senescence or contribute to this process, we analyzed
MCF7 growth in the presence of pepstatin A or siRNAs for CD or
eEF1. Pepstatin A is a specific inhibitor of aspartic proteases, such
as pepsin, rennin, and CD. However, because CD is the major
intracellular aspartic protease, the intracellular effects of pepstatin
A could be attributed to inhibition of CD activity (28). We found
that cell proliferation was greater in cells exposed to IR in the
presence of 100 Amol/L pepstatin A than in their non–pepstatin Atreated counterparts (Fig. 4A, a). Effect of pepstatin A on protein
levels was assessed (Fig. 4A, b). The densitometric quantification of
three independent Western blots revealed that eEF1A1 and p21
levels were significantly restored in the presence of pepstatin A (P <
0.05). However, pepstatin A did not significantly restore eEF1B2
levels (P > 0.05). Because CD level was rather increased by
pepstatin A treatment (Fig. 4A, b), we measured CD activity using a
fluorogenic CD activity kit. We found that CD activity was
decreased (Fig. 4B). It indicates that CD protein level was not
correlated with CD activity in pepstatin A-treated cells. Treatment
with pepstatin A alone did not alter levels of eEF1A1, eEF1B2, p21,
or p53 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Whereas CD protein level was a
little increased (Supplementary Fig. S4A), CD activity was inhibited
by pepstatin A treatment, as observed in treatment of IR and

pepstatin A (Fig. 4B). Cell number was affected by the treatment of
pepstatin A alone (Supplementary Fig. S4B), indicating that cell
growth rate was regulated by CD activity.
Next, we investigated the effect of siRNA-mediated CD
knockdown on cell growth and SA-h-Gal activity. The growth rate
and colony-forming ability of 3 Gy IR-exposed cells were increased
in the presence of CD siRNA than in the presence of control siRNA
(Fig. 4C, a). CD siRNA decreased SA-h-Gal activity (Fig. 4C, b).
Western blot analysis revealed that CD siRNA also blocked IRinduced changes in eEF1, phospho-pRb, and p21 levels (Fig. 4C, c).
These results, taken with results from the pepstatin A experiments,
suggest that CD is a pivotal participant in senescence.
Cells transfected with eEF1A1 siRNA had a flattened, large
appearance and exhibited SA-h-Gal activity (Fig. 5A). Proliferation
of these cells was clearly decreased, and in contrast to control
siRNA–transfected cells, these cells had barely detectable colonyforming ability (Fig. 5B and C). On the other hand, eEF1B2 siRNA–
transfected cells seemed shrunken, a characteristic not associated
with senescence (Fig. 5A). Cell number and colony-forming ability
were also decreased, and cleaved PARP was present (Fig. 5B–D).
Knockdown of eEF1 expression in siRNA-transfected cells was
confirmed (Fig. 5D).

and eEF1 as biomarkers of senescence. BALB/c nude mice were
bilaterally xenografted tumors on hind legs (n = 6). Control tumors on
right hind legs were left unirradiated, whereas tumors on left hind legs
were irradiated with a 12 Gy dose of g-rays, administered in three
fractions (4 Gy once every 3 days). Eight days after the final irradiation,
tumor volumes were measured (Fig. 6A), and the CD and eEF1 levels
were analyzed (Fig. 6B). In all mice, irradiated tumors exhibited CD
up-regulation, with the average fold change being 2.48 F 0.78 (mean F
SE). Fifty percent of mice showed a notable change in eEF1A1 and
eEF1B2 (>30% decrease compared with control), with the average fold
change being 0.36 F 0.08 and 0.53 F 0.03, respectively. Immunohistologic assays revealed that the rate of apoptosis was similar between
control and IR-exposed tumor tissue (Fig. 6C). However, cell
proliferation, which was detected with the cell proliferation marker
Ki-67, was evident only in control tumor tissue. Conversely, only
IR-exposed tumor tissue contained SA-h-Gal–positive cells. This
finding, taken with the changes observed in CD and eEF1 protein
levels, suggests that IR-induced senescence was contributed to the
low proliferation rate in this tissue.

Discussion
The fate of irradiated cells is controlled by a network of signaling
molecules and can range from premature senescence to mitotic

catastrophe or apoptosis. The extent to which apoptosis and other
types of cell death contribute to radiation treatment-induced death
is an ongoing controversy (29). Some evidence suggests that
senescence, not apoptosis, determines long-term responses to
tumor treatment, with this response depending on the cellular
status (30). Indeed, senescence induction is increased to compensate for inactivation of the apoptotic program (31). If the
senescence program remains intact when oncogenes promote
aberrant cell proliferation, the neoplastic lesion may stay in a
premalignant state (10). Cellular senescence, like apoptosis, plays
an important role in anticancer defense in vivo (32–34). Recent
in vivo studies provide evidence that senescence participates in
tumor suppression. For example, cellular senescence is crucial
in restricting tumorigenesis in Pten-deficient prostate and in
lymphomagenesis (35, 36). In Terc / mice, cellular senescence
suppresses spontaneous tumorigenesis in the presence of a
functional p53 signaling pathway (37). Moreover, tumor regression
in sarcomas is attributable to cellular senescence (38). Thus, the
efficacy of radiotherapy could be improved by understanding the
mechanisms by which IR induces premature senescence and
identifying useful biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis.
Several laboratories have conducted in vivo and in vitro
proteomic analyses to identify differentially expressed proteins

www.aacrjournals.org

involved in radiation signaling or aging (39–41). However, to our
knowledge, biomarkers of IR-induced cellular senescence have not
been validated nor determined the roles of these proteins in IRinduced senescence. Here, we identified and validated CD and eEF1
as useful biomarkers. These biomarkers have, for the first time,
made it possible to distinguish senescent cells from apoptotic,
transiently arrested, or autophagic cells (Figs. 2 and 3). CD was upregulated and eEF1 was down-regulated in senescent cells induced
not only by IR and hydrogen peroxide exposure but also by low
doses of the chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast, CD levels were
down-regulated, and eEF1 levels were unchanged under apoptotic
conditions. We also observed that CD and eEF1 levels were not
changed in response to transient cell cycle arrest, whereas their
levels were decreased in autophagic cells. Alterations in CD and
eEF1A1 levels were reproducible in replicative or oncogeneinduced senescence. However, because eEF1B2 was increased or
unchanged in these forms of senescence, it seems to be a less
relevant marker than CD and eEF1A1. Together, our findings show
that CD and eEF1A1 are promising markers for the detection of
cellular senescence. Until now, it has been unclear whether
alterations in the levels of identified biomarkers are unique to
senescence or are more generally related to cessation of cell
proliferation (42). Although p21 and p53 are thought to be the best

established markers of senescence currently available (12), our
results show that p21 and p53 are not reliable senescence markers
because they show altered protein levels during apoptosis or
transient cell cycle arrest. Our results strongly suggest that changes
of CD and eEF1 protein levels can accurately predict final cell
fates (i.e., cellular senescence, apoptosis, transient cell cycle arrest,
or autophagy) following a variety of treatments (Supplementary
Table S2).
The eEFs, including eEF1A and eEF1B, are required for the
elongation step of translation. The eEFs also have noncanonical
functions unrelated to protein synthesis (43). Emerging data show
that translation factors participate in the control of cell
proliferation, suggesting that these factors may serve as targets
for anticancer strategies (44). Our results have led us to surmise
that eEF1A1 and eEF1B2 have distinct noncanonical functions in
intracellular signaling cascades. That is, eEF1A1 may play a role in
senescence pathway, whereas eEF1B2 may contribute to apoptotic
pathway. In this study, the decreased level of eEF1 seen during
senescence was due to neither a decrease in mRNA nor
proteasomal degradation. Because binding of TIAR to eEF1 mRNA
regulates eEF1 expression, the eEF1 levels might be regulated by
TIAR in senescent cells (45).
CD is a ubiquitous lysosomal aspartic endoproteinase (46). CD is
overexpressed in cancer cells, where it enhances cell proliferation,
tumorigenesis, and metastasis (47). Several studies suggest that CD
participates in the signaling pathways leading to cell death. In
addition, CD levels are significantly increased during the normal
aging process (48). Here, CD was dramatically increased during
senescence and decreased during apoptosis. Taken together, it
suggests that regulation of CD expression would be an effective
strategy for manipulating senescence and apoptosis pathways.
Tremendous advances have been made in our understanding of
senescence during the past half century. Many genes that undergo
changes in expression in senescent cells have been identified;
however, whether these changes in gene expression contribute to

senescence phenotypes or are simply a consequence of senescence
is unknown (49). We have shown not only that CD and eEF1 are
useful marker molecules for detecting senescent cancer cells but
also that these molecules have critical functions in the regulation of
cell proliferation. In addition, we show that senescence-associated
changes in CD and eEF1 levels can be extended to an irradiated
xenografted mouse model. Nevertheless, more extensive studies
with experimental animals and patient samples will be required to
definitively assess the value of CD and eEF1 as senescence markers
in vivo.
The factors governing cellular decisions to undergo senescence,
apoptosis, or transient growth arrest are incompletely understood.
Rapid and complete DNA repair is thought to quickly terminate
p53-p21 signaling, whereas slow and incomplete repair results in
sustained signaling, ultimately inducing senescence or apoptosis
(49). Genome-wide gene expression analysis has revealed that very
limited overlap exists among gene expression profiles of cells
undergoing senescence in response to different stimuli (41).
Understanding these mechanisms will be necessary for developing
alternative, less toxic cancer therapies, which aim to induce cellular
senescence. In the meantime, eEF1 and CD may serve as valuable
biomarkers for cellular senescence induced by IR, anticancer drugs,
or other treatments.
