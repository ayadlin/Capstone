Abstract
Many cancer cells express Toll-like receptors (TLR) that offer possible therapeutic targets. Polyadenylicpolyuridylic acid [poly(A:U)] is an agonist of the Toll-like receptor TLR3 that displays anticancer properties.
In this study, we illustrate how the immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects of this agent can be
uncoupled to therapeutic advantage. We took advantage of two TLR3-expressing tumor models that produced
large amounts of CCL5 (a CCR5 ligand) and CXCL10 (a CXCR3 ligand) in response to type I IFN and poly(A:U),
both in vitro and in vivo. Conventional chemotherapy or in vivo injection of poly(A:U), alone or in combination,
failed to reduce tumor growth unless an immunochemotherapeutic regimen of vaccination against tumor
antigens was included. CCL5 blockade improved the efficacy of immunochemotherapy, whereas CXCR3 blockade abolished its beneficial effects. These findings show how poly(A:U) can elicit production of a range of
chemokines by tumor cells that reinforce immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive effects. Optimizing the
anticancer effects of TLR3 agonists may require manipulating these chemokines or their receptors. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR) are being evaluated
for the treatment of cancer (1, 2). Preclinical studies revealed
that systemic administration of TLR agonists can boost innate immunity, augment antibody-dependent effector functions, and enhance adaptive immune responses (1–3). TLR3
is the critical sensor of viral double-stranded RNA (4). The
synthetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] is a

TLR3 ligand (TLR3L) that mediates potent adjuvant effects
in thus far that it strongly enhances antigen-specific CD8+
T-cell responses (5, 6), promotes antigen cross-presentation
by dendritic cells (7), and directly acts on effector CD8+ T
and natural killer (NK) cells to augment IFN-γ release (8).
Poly(I:C) is recognized by both the endosomal receptor
TLR3 and cytosolic receptors, including RNA helicases such
as RIG-I and the melanoma differentiation–associated gene 5
(MDA5). In the poly(I:C)-induced immune responses in vivo,
MDA5 is critical for IFN-γ induction, whereas TLR3 is mandatory for IL-12p40 release (9).
Another synthetic double-stranded RNA, polyadenylic:
polyuridylic acid [poly(A:U)], which only signals through
TLR3, has also been widely used in preclinical and clinical
studies. When combined with a candidate protein or viral antigen in mice, poly(A:U) can promote antigen-specific Th1immune responses and boost antibody production (10, 11).
Poly(A:U) has been safely used with moderate success for
treating breast or gastric cancers as a monotherapy (12–
14). Retrospective analyses highlighted that TLR3-expressing
breast cancers may be selectively sensitive to the antitumor
effects of poly(A:U). Indeed, TLR3 is not only expressed by
immune cells but also by some epithelial (15) or endothelial
cells (16). Intracellular staining for TLR3 was reported for human breast cancers (17) and melanoma (18) and its expression can be induced by type I IFNs. TLR3 signaling can
directly inhibit the proliferation of carcinoma cells (19) or
can induce apoptosis when combined with protein synthesis
inhibitors or type I IFN (17, 18). Besides these beneficial effects on established cancers, TLR3 signaling may also

Optimizing Poly(A:U) Anticancer Therapy

participate in proinflammatory reactions contributing to
tumorigenesis, suggesting that exploiting the TLR system in
cancer might be a doubled-edged sword (20–22). Consequently, there is a need for a fine dissection of the direct
(on tumor cells) versus the indirect (on immune cells) effects
of TLR agonists as their potential anticancer effects are being
evaluated.
Taking advantage of two murine tumor models expressing
TLR3, we show that poly(A:U) acts not only in host cells but
also in the tumor parenchyma to generate the opposite action of two chemokines, CXCL10 and CCL5, which are favorable and deleterious for the clinical outcome, respectively.
These findings support the idea that manipulating TLR3 signaling for cancer therapy will benefit from uncoupling chemokine receptor signaling at the tumor/host interface.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Poly(A:U) was from Innate Pharma. The murine
type I IFN was produced by M. Ferrantini (Istituto Superiore
di Sanità). Human IFN α2b and ELISA kits for CCL5 and
CXCL10 were from R&D Systems. Ovalbumin was from Calbiochem. CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) 1668 was from
MWG Biotech AG. Methionylated RANTES (MetRantes) was
provided by Amanda Proudfoot (Merck Serono Geneva Research Center, Geneva, Switzerland).
Mice and cell lines. B16-OVA murine melanoma cells
were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1 mmol/L
nonessential amino acids, and 10 mmol/L HEPES. Murine
GL26 glioma cells (H-2b) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL
penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 50 μmol/L
β-mercaptoethanol. Human breast cancer primary cultures
were established at Institut Gustave Roussy from metastatic
patients suffering from ascitis; patients provided informed
consent. Cells were used after three passages of propagation
in AIM-V culture medium.
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River. C57BL/
6 nude mice were obtained from animal facility of Institut
Gustave Roussy. Trif−/−, Cxcr3−/−, and Ccr5−/− green fluorescent
protein (GFP) mice were bred at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique IEM 2815, Orléans, France, and Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U543, Paris,
France. The experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Institut Gustave Roussy.
In vitro tumor stimulation assays. B16-OVA (or GL26;
5 × 104) or primary human breast cancer cells (2 × 105) were
seeded in 24-well plates, treated with 1,000 IU/mL of type I
IFN for 18 h, and then treated with poly(A:U) for 48 h. Supernatants were collected to dose chemokine production.
Tumor models and immunotherapy. B16-OVA (3 × 105 or
6 × 105) and GL26 (6 × 105) cells were inoculated s.c. into the
left flank of mice. Vaccines were injected into the right footpad [for CpG+OVA: CpG ODN 1668 (5 μg/mouse) plus ovalbumin (1 mg/mouse)] or right flank [or cell vaccines: 106
B16-OVA or GL26 pretreated with type I IFN (1,000 IU/mL)

for 18 h and then doxorubicin (20 μmol/L) for 24 h for each
mouse]. Chemotherapy (oxaliplatin) was applied i.p. at
5 mg/kg. Poly(A:U) was injected i.p. at 100 μg per mouse in
B16-OVA model and at 500 μg per mouse in the GL26 model.
MetRantes (10 μg/mouse) was injected i.p. daily for 3 wk to
block CCL5. Necrotic cells (F/T) were obtained following
two consecutive cycles of freezing (liquid nitrogen) and
thawing (37°C). For preimmunization, OVA-CpG vaccine
was injected into the right footpad 7 d before inoculation
of tumor cells. To block CXCR3, anti–CXCR3-173 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) or the control mAb (PIP)
were injected i.p. at 200 μg per mouse every other day for
12 d since 5 d before tumor cell inoculation.
Lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA construction. The
lentivirus construction and viral particles were designed
and produced by Vectalys SA. As for the lentivirus carrying
the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knocking down CCL5, the
forward primer 5′-CGCGACGTCAAGGAGTATTTCTATTCAAGAGATAGAAATACTCCTTGACGTTTTTTTGCA-3′ and
the reverse primer 3′-TGCAGTTCCTCATAAAGATAAGTTCTCTATCTTTATGAGGAACTGCAAAAAA-5′ were
annealed and ligated into vector [pLV-H1-EF1-PURO-IRESGFP (pV2.3.127)] by cohesive MluI/NsiI ligation. A similar
approach was used to knockdown Lamin A/C and TRIF expression targeting sequences 5′-GAAGGAGGGTGACCTGATA-3′ and 5′-GGAAAGCAGTGGCCTATTA-3′, respectively.
Flow cytometry. Cells from tumor, tumor draining lymph
node (DLN), or vaccine DLN were isolated by mechanical
dissociation and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer.
CD3ε-PerCP, CD8-FITC (BD Pharmingen), CXCR3-PE (R&D
System), NK1.1-Pacific Blue (eBioscience), and isotype control antibodies (2.5 μg/mL) were used for the surface staining
at 4°C for 30 min. Hydroxystilbamidine (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) was used to exclude dead cells. For intracellular
staining, freshly isolated cells were treated with 50 ng/mL
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 μg/mL ionomycin, and
Golgi-stop (BD Pharmingen) for 4 h at 37°C in RPMI containing 2% mouse serum (Janvier). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with IFN-γ–allophycocyanin (BD Pharmingen)
with fixation/permeabilization kits (BD Bioscience).
Protein extraction. Tumors were mechanically dissociated with lysis buffer (T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent, Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor (complete
Mini EDTA-free, Roche). Tumor lysate was then centrifuged
at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to obtain supernatant. Alternatively, tumors were digested with 400 U/mL Collagenase IV
and 150 U/mL DNase I for 30 min. Single-cell suspension was
sorted using AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) to obtain CD45+
and CD45− fractions, and whole-cell protein was extracted
using lysis buffer (1 × 106 cells/100 μL buffer).
Statistical analyses. Comparison of continuous data and
categorical data were achieved by the Mann-Whitney U test
and by χ2 as appropriate. The log-rank test was used for
analysis of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. All P values are
two-tailed. All P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant for all experiments. *, **, and *** indicated P values
of <0.05, <0.01, and <0.001, respectively.

Results
Synergistic effects between vaccines, chemotherapy, and
poly(A:U). To characterize the relative importance of direct
effects of poly(A:U) on tumor parenchyma versus indirect, immune-mediated effects, we took advantage of the B16-OVA,
which expresses TLR3 (data not shown), such as the parental
cell line B16F10 (Supplementary Fig. S1) as well as the model
antigen ovalbumin (OVA). Albeit mediating significant cyto-

static effects on B16-OVA tumor cells in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. S2), oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy failed to hamper tumor progression in vivo when it was administered alone or
combined with the poly(A:U) (Fig. 1B), following the protocol
detailed in Fig. 1A. However, the administration of a vaccine
composed of OVA plus the adjuvant CpG before the combination of oxaliplatin and poly(A:U) significantly retarded tumor
growth (Fig. 1B) and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing
C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1C). This vaccine, when applied in the

footpad opposite to the flank where the tumor was growing,
stimulated an OVA-specific Th1 immune response in the DLN
(Supplementary Fig. S3). It is noteworthy that B16-OVA did
not express TLR9 and did not respond to CpG ODN in vitro
(data not shown). The antitumor effects of the sequential administration of a vaccine followed by oxaliplatin and TLR3L
was well reproducible in immunocompetent wild-type (WT)
C57BL/6 mice, yet failed to be observed in nu/nu and Trif−/−
mice (Fig. 1D), indicating the obligate contribution of T cells
and TRIF-dependent signals to the therapeutic effect. Altogether, 11% of WT mice were completely protected from melanoma by the sequential therapeutic regimen (Fig. 1C), and
67% among the tumor-free mice developed long-term protective immunity and hence became resistant to a later challenge
with live tumor cells (data not shown).
We observed a similar antitumor effect when chemotherapy and poly(A:U) injections were combined with a cellbased anticancer vaccine. The freeze-thawing technique
aimed at mediating the nonimmunogenic cell death (necrosis) in contrast to anthracycline-induced tumor cell death
that generates an endoplasmic reticulum stress response
(23). In accordance with our previous reports, type I IFN
and doxorubicin induced immunogenic cell death of B16OVA cells and injection of dying cells induced a protective
immunity against later rechallenge with live B16-OVA cells

(Fig. 2A and B). This cell-based vaccine boosted the antitumor activity of the combination of oxaliplatin plus poly(A:
U) (Fig. 2C) and enhanced survival (Fig. 2D) when used in
a therapeutic setting after the implantation of tumors. Very
similar results were obtained when B16-OVA melanoma cells
were replaced by another TLR3-expressing cell line, GL26
glioblastoma (Supplementary Fig. S1), which only bears natural tumor antigens. Vaccination of immunocompetent mice
with GL26 cells that were dying in response to type I IFN and
doxorubicin was efficient in preventing tumor outgrowth in
the prophylactic setting (Fig. 3A) and also in the therapeutic
setting only if the vaccination was combined with oxaliplatin
and TLR3L following a regimen identical to that presented in
Fig. 1A (Fig. 3B). To further show the importance of the TLR3
agonist on tumor parenchyma during vaccine+chemotherapy
+TLR3L (VCT) therapy, we selectively knocked down the
TRIF adaptor molecule in GL26 glioblastoma (Lamin as a
negative control). Interestingly, VCT therapy failed to control
the tumor outgrowth of TRIF knockdown GL26 in vivo (Fig. 3C).
Altogether, it seems that poly(A:U) could mediate synergistic antitumor effects with chemotherapy against established TLR3-expressing tumors, provided that this
combined therapy was preceded by anticancer vaccination.
For the sake of brevity, we will refer to this therapeutic
schedule as “immunochemotherapy.”

type I IFN plus doxorubicin and rechallenged with live syngeneic tumor cells 7 d later. The kinetics of tumor outgrowth are monitored. B, the cell-based
vaccine was then assessed for its therapeutic efficacy in the VCT setting outlined in Fig. 1A. C, after knockdown TRIF expression in GL26 (Lamin as a
control), established tumors were treated with the VCT protocol starting from day 15. Tumor growth kinetics are shown from one representative experiment
with five mice per group.

TLR3-expressing tumors directly responded to poly(A:U).
The finding that TRIF must be intact both in the host's immune system and the tumor parenchyma for full antitumor
effects (Figs. 1D and 3C) suggested that poly(A:U) might exert
direct effects on the tumor parenchyma. When added to B16OVA cells in vitro, poly(A:U) induced the secretion of copious
amounts of both CCL5/RANTES and CXCL10/IP-10. This effect could be further enhanced by preincubation with type I
IFN (Fig. 4A). Type I IFN plus poly(A:U) showed an additive
effect on CCL5 secretion by both GL26 (Fig. 4B) and human
breast cancer cells (in three of four primary cultures; Supplementary Fig. S4). GL26 cells also secreted more CXCL10
when treated with type I IFN plus poly(A:U) compared with
either treatment alone (Fig. 4B). TRIF knockdown GL26 cells
lost their response to poly(A:U) stimulation, whereas Lamin
knockdown GL26 behaved like parental cells (Supplementary

Fig. S5). Interestingly, the secretion of CXCL1 by B16-OVA
was abolished by poly(A:U) (Fig. 4A).
To validate these findings in vivo, we studied the concentration of CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL5, and CXCL10 within tumor
beds at each single step of the tritherapy in B16-OVA model.
We observed a significant production of CCL5 at baseline before chemotherapy. This CCL5 production dropped after the
first TLR3L injection but increased again after the third injection of poly(A:U) (Fig. 4C, top left), whereas no CCL3 was
produced (data not shown). In accordance with in vitro data,
the tissular concentration of CXCL10 paralleled that of CCL5
in vivo after oxaliplatin injection and the third injection of
poly(A:U) (Fig. 4C, bottom right). To further dissect whether
chemokine production originated from leukocytes or tumor
cells, we sorted CD45+ versus CD45− cells from dissociated
tumor beds after each poly(A:U) injection and observed that

the accumulating source of chemokines resided in the tumor
parenchyma (Fig. 4D).
Altogether, these results indicate that poly(A:U) can directly act on tumor cells to stimulate the production of chemokines, both in vitro and in vivo.
Deleterious role of CCL5 and CCR5. TLR3 stimulation
can trigger the release of a variety of chemokines, including
CCL5 (24, 25), as confirmed for the tumors studied in this

article, whereas the role of CCR5 (CCL5 receptor) in cancer
remains controversial. CCR5 expression in tumor epithelia
has been associated with tumorigenesis (26) although some
cancer immunotherapies require a functional CCR5 pathway (5, 27, 28). Therefore, we investigated the impact of
CCR5 on the synergistic effects of our immunochemotherapy. Surprisingly, the tritherapy was more efficacious when
it was applied to Ccr5−/− mice rather than to WT mice (Fig. 5A

Figure 5. CCR5 signaling antagonized the efficacy of immunochemotherapy. B16-OVA tumor growth was compared in WT versus Ccr5−/− mice with or

VCT was compared between CCL5 and Lamin knockdown B16-OVA. All experiments were conducted with five mice per group at least twice, yielding
identical results.

and B). We corroborated these data using a pharmacologic
inhibitor recombinant MetRantes that could inhibit agonistinduced activities (29). MetRantes significantly improved tumor
growth retardation caused by the immunochemotherapy in
the B16-OVA model (Fig. 5C). This result was also confirmed
in the GL26 glioblastoma (data not shown).
To further show that the source of the deleterious CCL5
was indeed the tumor cells stimulated by poly(A:U) during
our sequential therapy, we carried out CCL5 knockdown in
B16-OVA by lentiviruses carrying a shRNA-targeting CCL5
(Lamin as a control). This infection induced a significant
suppression of the poly(A:U)-induced CCL5 production
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S6). The tritherapy mediated
enhanced antitumor activity and long-term survival against
established B16-OVA–shRNA CCL5 compared with established B16-OVA–shRNA Lamin control (Fig. 5D), whereas
the spontaneous growth of each transfectant was comparable in vitro (data not shown).
Altogether, these results support the idea that the interaction between CCL5 that originated from tumors and
CCR5 that was expressed in the host-derived immune effector has a negative impact on the outcome of immunochemotherapy.
CXCR3 as a positive mediator of immunochemotherapy.
The OVA-CpG vaccine, which elicited potent IFN-γ–polarized
T-cell responses in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. S3),
failed to promote the tumoricidal activity when combined
with chemotherapy and TLR3L in nu/nu C57BL/6 mice
(Fig. 1D), suggesting that IFN-γ–producing T lymphocytes
are required for the antitumor effects. Knowing that IFNγ–polarized T cells express CXCR3 (30) and TLR3L promotes CXCL10 secretion (a CXCR3 ligand) by tumor cells
(31), we compared the efficacy of the immunochemotherapy in WT versus Cxcr3−/− mice carrying B16-OVA tumors.
In contrast to WT littermate controls, in which immunochemotherapy yielded a significant delay in tumor growth,
no beneficial effect was observed for the control of tumors
growing in Cxcr3−/− mice (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the chemokine receptor CXCR3, which is widely expressed in NK
cells and activated Th1 and CTLs, is mandatory for the
therapeutic success of the combined therapy. Accordingly,
functional immunophenotyping revealed that immunochemotherapy induced augmented recruitment of CD8+
CXCR3+ T lymphocytes in the vaccine DLN but not in
the tumor DLN (data not shown). These lymphocytes were
able to produce IFN-γ upon restimulation with OVA (Supplementary Fig. S3; Fig. 6B). NK cells did not express CXCR3
in these settings (data not shown). Importantly, the percentage of CD8+ CXCR3+ T cells increased among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) after immunochemotherapy (Fig. 6B),
supporting the notion that this T-cell subset contributes to
the anticancer efficacy of immunochemotherapy.
Next, we incubated B16-OVA with type I IFN and poly(A:U)
(which both mediated cytostatic effects on B16-OVA in vitro
as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2) and inoculated these tumor cells into WT animals. This pretreatment reduced the
minimal tumorigenic dose (the number of cells that had to
be inoculated to generate a tumor; Fig. 6C). This gain of tu-

www.aacrjournals.org

morigenicity was lost when the animals were immunized
with the OVA-CpG vaccine (Fig. 6D), indicating that the direct effect of poly(A:U) stimulation of the tumor cells is beneficial only when the host has been immunized (when
specific CTL against tumoral antigen are present within the
host). The beneficial effect of prophylactic immunization
with OVA-CpG was abrogated if the tumor cells were injected together with an anti-CXCR3 neutralizing antibody
(Fig. 6D). Altogether, these results underscore the importance of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 for allowing
immune effectors to control tumor growth in vivo.

Discussion
Although TLR agonists may contribute to the activation of
anticancer responses, they may also directly increase the tumorigenic potential of TLR-expressing tumor cells (3, 15).
The aim of this study was to weigh the relative impact of individual components of the chemokine cascade resulting
from chronic stimulation of the tumor epithelium with the
TLR3L in vivo. Our findings revealed that poly(A:U) triggers
the concomitant secretion of both CCL5 and CXCL10 from
TLR3-expressing tumor in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 4), and interfering with CCR5 engagement on host hematopoietic cells
enhanced the efficacy of an immunogenic treatment that
stimulated a T-cell– and CXCR3-dependent anticancer immune response (Figs. 1D and 6A and D). These results suggest
that the optimization of anticancer therapies relying on TLR
adjuvants may require uncoupling of the chemokine cascade.
It is known that systemic administration of poly(A:U) can
exert immunoadjuvant effects through TLR3 and TLR7 (32).
Although both TLR3 and TLR7 were required for the clonal
expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, only TLR3 was
mandatory to generate IFN-γ–producing CD8+ T cells (32).
Our biweekly administration of poly(A:U) was not able to
trigger potent immunoadjuvant effects when poly(A:U) was
given alone. However, combined with vaccines and chemotherapy, poly(A:U) triggers an efficient T-cell–dependent
and TRIF-dependent antitumor response. TRIF signaling
leads to type I IFN production by host allophycocyanin,
which might directly act on tumor cells to upregulate TLR3
expression (33, 34) and/or synergize with TLR3 to stimulate
the release of chemokines (Fig. 4). Of note, we could measure increased levels of CXCL10 and CCL5 in tumor beds only after
three systemic administrations of poly(A:U), supporting that
host factors (such as type I IFN) may cooperate with poly(A:U)
to stimulate the induction of chemokines by tumor cells.
As shown by other groups (35), combinations of specific
tumor vaccines with chemotherapy may significantly ameliorate progression-free survival. Surprisingly, although two different vaccines could elicit prophylactic antitumor effects
(Figs. 2B and 3A) and IFN-γ–producing T cells on their
own (Supplementary Fig. S3 or data not shown), we could
not achieve significant synergistic effects by associating such
vaccines with taxanes or oxaliplatin for the treatment of melanoma (Fig. 1 and data not shown). One possible explanation
for this absence of synergy might be the failure of tumor beds
to produce chemokines that attract polarized effector CD8+

Figure 6. CXCR3-dependent antitumor effects mediated by VCT therapy associated with CXCR3+ TILs. A, the mean tumor size at day 19 in VCT or control
group is compared between Cxcr3−/− versus WT mice. B, DLNs from the vaccine site or the contralateral site were collected at day 13 from VCT or
control group. Cells were restimulated with OVA protein (or PBS) either for 48 h to monitor the OVA-specific IFN-γ production in the supernatants by ELISA
(top left) or for 12 h before intracellular stainings showing IFN-γ production by CD8+CXCR3+ T cells (percentages and absolute numbers). Tumors from
NaCl versus VCT-treated mice were dissociated at day 16 and analyzed for the percentage of CXCR3+ cells among CD8+ cells (bottom right). C, B16-OVA
cells were pretreated with type I IFN followed by poly(A:U) and the minimal tumorigenic dose of B16-OVA cells was determined. The percentages of
tumor-bearing mice at day 68 are depicted. D, mice were preimmunized with OVA-CpG and challenged 7 d later with the minimal tumorigenic dose of
B16-OVA tumor cells (0.33 × 105) presensitized with poly(A:U) and type I IFN. CXCR3-173 neutralizing mAb or control PIP mAb were applied. The graph
depicts the percentages of tumor-bearing mice at day 68 in one of two experiments.

T cells (Fig. 4C). Indeed, some reports (36, 37) supported the
notion that intratumoral chemokines (such as lymphotactin/
XCL1 or CXCL10) could enhance the trafficking of effector
T cell to tumors and ameliorate the anticancer efficacy of
adoptively transferred T lymphocytes.
Although highly activated CD8+ T cells can coexist with
autoantigen-expressing hepatocytes without causing overt
tissue damage (38), engagement of TLR3 could break this immunoprivileged state by triggering IFN-γ and tumor necrosis

factor-α–dependent CXCL9 expression in the liver and by recruiting CXCR3+ autoreactive CTLs (38). Indeed, a TLR3 agonist could induce the VLA-4–dependent homing of specific
CTL into central nervous system tumors (39). Accordingly,
several reports described that TLR3 signaling in astrocytes
or glioma induced multiple proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, including IP-10, IL-8, or GROα (39, 40). However, the theory that TLR3 agonists augment trafficking of CTL
into tumor beds has been challenged by a recent report

Optimizing Poly(A:U) Anticancer Therapy

showing that injections of double-stranded RNA [poly(I:C)]
into mesotheliomas did not stimulate the recruitment of
newly primed antitumor T cells and rather reactivated local
CD8+ T cells in a type I IFN–dependent manner (41). However, it has not been clarified whether mesothelioma cells express TLR3 and it remains formally possible that poly(I:C)
may activate TLR3-independent signaling pathways that improve clinical outcome by alternative mechanisms of action.
Secretion of CC chemokines is a major determinant for
chemoattraction of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes into tumor beds in human carcinogenesis (42). In
breast cancer for instance, mesenchymal stem cells produce
CCL5, which enhances the metastatic potential of tumors
and correlates with disease progression (43, 44). Moreover,
tumor-infiltrating leukocytes may express high levels of the
CCL5 receptors CCR1 and CCR5 (45). Injection of a CCL5 antagonist can reduce the migration of macrophages to tumor
beds and facilitate tumor regression (45). In WT animals,
CXCR3 expression in tumor-specific IFN-γ–producing T cells
was enhanced, which facilitates their trafficking to the tumor
beds (Fig. 6B), whereas in Ccr5−/− mice, we failed to observe
an exaggerated accumulation of Tc1 cells (data not shown).
Although concanavalin A–treated Ccr5−/− mice suffered from
severe hepatitis related to pronounced recruitment and activation of IFN-γ–producing NK cells into the liver (46), we
failed to monitor an enhanced proportion of CXCR3+ NK
cells in the tumor or DLNs (data not shown). It remains conceivable that CXCR3 can be downregulated in NK cells upon
engagement with local chemokines. Therefore, the beneficial
effect of CCR5 inhibition may be most likely related to the
disappearance of subsets of immunosuppressive cells rather
than to the recruitment or activation of effector IFN-γ–producing CD8+ T cells.
Within the hematopoietic system, CCR5 is expressed in
regulatory T cells (47) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC; ref. 5), making them potential candidates for im-

mune suppressors. However, we failed to improve the efficacy of the immunochemotherapy either by using metronomic
dosages of cyclophosphamide that reduce functionally active
regulatory T cells (48), or by administering sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor known to downregulate the principal immunosuppressive effectors (arginase-1 and NOS-2) of
MDSC (data not shown; ref. 49). These results suggested that
Treg and MDSCs may not be the CCR5+-immunosuppressive
subsets to be identified.
Our results support two important conclusions. First, TLR3
agonists can promote TLR3+ tumor cells to produce chemokines that accumulate locally to physiologically relevant concentrations. Second, these intratumoral chemokines likewise
are not neutral in their clinical significance and need to be
uncoupled to boost the efficacy of immunochemotherapy.
