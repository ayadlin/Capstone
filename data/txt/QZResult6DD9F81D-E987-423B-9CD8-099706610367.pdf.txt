Recent Improvement in the Survival of
Patients With Advanced Nonsmall Cell Lung
Cancer Enrolled in Phase III Trials of FirstLine, Systemic Chemotherapy
recent article by Hotta and colleagues1 reports that survival of
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) improved slowly
over time from 1982 to 2002. Authors pooled together 121 phase 3
trials (42,768 patients overall), divided into 3 periods: 1982–1988,
1989–1995, and 1996–2002, for the purpose of making a comparison.
It is a common feeling among physicians caring for patients
with NSCLC that their overall survival has slightly improved. However, no author has really demonstrated this improvement in survival, and results derived from Hotta’s article are not convincing yet,
so, here we analyze several issues.
The number of trials in the last 2 periods, 57 and 121 respectively,
surpass the number of trials in the ﬁrst period 1982–1988, 20 overall.
The number of patients with performance status 2 in trials over
the 3 periods is different, signiﬁcantly less in the last decades’ trials,
where it is well known that the main survival prognostic factor in
lung cancer is performance status. The number of trials with more
than 300 and 600 patients has also increased over time, making it
difﬁcult to compare small trials in the 1980s with larger trials of
recent periods.
Patients with stage IV disease increased over time, which may
be attributed to the development of more effective instruments in
detecting metastasis, because a stage shift over time is not a reasonable explanation.
Furthermore, in our opinion, an important issue is the use of
second-line treatment. In the 1980s, there was no recognized rule
for second-line treatment, until the years beginning in 2000, when
docetaxel was demonstrated to be signiﬁcantly superior than best
supportive care (BSC), regarding overall survival and progressionfree survival.2 Do Hotta et al. know if second-line treatment was
used, especially in trials of the third period?
Lastly, it is our opinion that the wide conﬁdence intervals in
overall survival make differences among the trials of the 3 periods
less consistent.
Thus, we would suggest less emphasis in stating an increased
survival in patients affected by NSCLC over time on the basis of
their analysis. It may be an appropriate feeling, but there is no clear
demonstration yet.

Systemic Chemotherapy

The potential inﬂuence of second-line chemotherapy is also an important point in assessing the
effect of ﬁrst-line chemotherapy, and such salvage
therapy may contribute to recent survival improvement, as Bearz et al. commented. However, its effect
on survival was signiﬁcant but, indeed, quite modest.2
Furthermore, in our study, the survival prolongation
was observed regarding median time to progression
after the initiation of ﬁrst-line chemotherapy, considered not to be affected by effects of the secondline treatment.
Finally, we now truly realize that such survival
improvement over the years is quite modest, with
only a few days increase per year, and we are far
from satisﬁed with this modest survival improvement. Throughout our reporting, we did not intend
to stress only signiﬁcance of survival improvement
with passage of time. Rather, we emphasized quite
limited survival-time improvement in the article, and
we concluded, and still consider, that novel targets
and new agents are needed for future ﬁghts against
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer.

n comparing survival among 3 treatment periods
(1982–1988, 1989–1995, and 1996–2002) in patients
with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer enrolled in
phase 3 trials of ﬁrst-line systemic chemotherapy, as
Bearz and colleagues suggested, we noticed the
potential interference of the heterogeneity of trial
characteristics, with a large proportion of patients
with poor performance status and with stage IV disease and a number of randomized patients across
each trial.1 This is a critical issue in our analysis. To
minimize such inﬂuence, we conducted a multivariate analysis for survival, adjusting for these confounding factors that could affect patient survival. It
is of note that after adjusting these factors, the year
of trial initiation still inﬂuenced patient survival
signiﬁcantly (P .0001 for median survival time and
P .0130 for time to progression). Therefore, we can
say that our ﬁndings support the common feeling
pointed out by Bearz et al. that the overall survival
in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
slightly improved.
