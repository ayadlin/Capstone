Abstract
The adverse effects of chemotherapy on normal cells of the body create substantial clinical problems for many
cancer patients. However, relatively little is known about the effects, other than promotion of cell death, of such
agents on the function of normal precursor cells critical in tissue homeostasis and repair. We have combined
mathematical and experimental analyses to identify the effects of sublethal doses of chemotherapy on glial
precursor cells of the central nervous system. We modeled the temporal development of a population of
precursor and terminally differentiated cells exposed to sublethal doses of carmustine (BCNU), a classic
alkylating chemotherapeutic agent used in treatment of gliomas and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, as a multitype
age-dependent branching process. We fitted our model to data from in vitro clonal experiments using the
method of pseudo-likelihood. This approach identifies several novel drug effects, including modification of the
cell cycle length, the time between division and differentiation, and alteration in the probability of undergoing
self-renewal division in precursor cells. These changes of precursor cell function in the chemotherapy-exposed
brain may have profound clinic implications.
Major Findings: We applied our computational approach to analyze the effects of BCNU on clonal cultures of
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells—one of the best-characterized neural progenitor cells in the mammalian brain.
Our analysis reveals that transient exposures to BCNU increased the cell cycle length of progenitor cells and
decreased their time to differentiation, while also decreasing the likelihood that they will undergo self-renewing
divisions. By investigating the behavior of our mathematical model, we demonstrate that precursor cell
populations should recover spontaneously from transient modifications of the timing of division and of
differentiation, but such recovery will not happen after alteration of cell fate. These studies identify means
by which precursor cell function can be critically compromised by transient exposure to chemotherapy with
long-term consequences on the progenitor cell pool even in the absence of drug-induced apoptosis. These
analyses also provide novel tools that apply broadly to identify effects of chemotherapeutic agents and other
physiological stressors. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10051–9. 2010 AACR.

toxicities are frequently seen in tissues that contain dividing
precursor cells (a term used here to include both tissuespecific stem cells and the lineage-committed progenitor cells
they generate as intermediates in the production of differentiated cell types).
Although toxicity of chemotherapy may be seen both as
acute and chronic complications, the alterations in cellular
function (other than cell death) resulting in long-term and
delayed adverse effects are poorly understood. For instance,
the promotion of differentiation of dividing precursor cells
into nondividing differentiated cells provides a nonlethal
means of reducing the number of precursor cells available
for tissue homeostasis or repair. Still another means by which
dividing precursor cells may be reduced in number would be if
exposure to chemotherapeutic agents induced a nonproductive mitotic arrest, such that the cells neither divide nor
differentiate.
Clonal analysis offers the most powerful means of analyzing the behavior of precursor cells in respect to division and

between the final cell cycle and the occurrence of overt differentiation. It also considers possible alterations induced by drug
exposures in the timing of division and differentiation, and in the
probability of self-renewing division. This approach was applied
to investigate alterations of the division and differentiation of O2A/OPCs, following exposure to BCNU. The analysis demonstrates that transient exposure to sublethal concentrations of
BCNU compromises the capacity of O-2A/OPCs for continued
cell division while promoting their premature differentiation
into nondividing oligodendrocytes, thereby leading to the generation of fewer total progeny from each individual clonal
founder cell. In addition, we analyzed drug effects in regard
to how changes in parameter values (e.g., the probability of
division or the timing of division and differentiation) influence
the behavior of the mathematical model. Our investigations
suggest, for instance, that a small reduction in the probability of
division induced by transient exposure to BCNU may change
dramatically the composition of the population that does not
spontaneously restore normal cell numbers after chemotherapy
is completed.

Materials and Methods
Clonal experiments on oligodendrocyte generation
All experiments were conducted by growing O-2A/OPCs at
clonal densities in tissue culture flasks as previously described
(5, 10, 12, 15). O-2A/OPCs generate clones of cells that can be
individually examined for their composition. The O-2A/OPC
lineage is ideally suitable for such analysis, as changes in cell
morphology are tightly correlated with changes in their antigenic profile, allowing identification of their state of differentiation with >98% accuracy using a microscope (10–16). One
day after plating, half of the cultures were transiently exposed
to 1 mmol/L BCNU for 1 hour (to reflect the half-life of BCNU in
vivo; refs. 35, 36). This dose did not result in significant cell
death (<5% reduction in number of viable cells) of O-2A/OPCs
in mass culture. This level of exposure is at least 90% lower than
the 8 to 10mmol/L concentrations of BCNU reported to be
achieved in the CNS with low-dose exposures in vivo (36, 37).
BCNU was washed out and clones were followed daily. Control
flasks were treated similarly, but in the absence of BCNU. Every
day from day 2 to day 7, the composition of 100 clones (50
controls and 50 treated) was analyzed by morphologic examination, yielding a total of 600 independent observations (each
observation provided the numbers of O-2A/OPCs and oligodendrocytes counted in a same clone using a microscope).
Branching process models of dividing and
differentiating O-2A/OPCs
One of the primary challenges in studying subtle aspects of
progenitor cell function is that time-lapse microscopy, the
most sensitive technique, requires costly instrumentation,
only allows limited numbers of clones to be studied, and
cannot be applied in vivo. In contrast, clonal analysis can be
conducted so as to obtain larger amounts of data at low cost,
and can even be used to study differentiation in vivo (38). The
problem with clonal analysis, however, is that the events of
division and differentiation of progenitor cells and their

www.aacrjournals.org

alteration by exposures to a chemotherapeutic agent are
not directly observable. To address this problem, we developed a branching process model of the generation of clonal
families of O-2A/OPCs, which is defined by the following
assumptions (see also Fig. 1):
Model assumptions under normal conditions
A1. The process begins at time t ¼ 0 with a single progenitor
cell of generation 1. Every progenitor cell of generation k  1
either divides into 2 progenitor cells of generation k þ 1 with
probability pk, or it differentiates into a single oligodendrocyte
with probability 1–pk. In our analyses we set
pk ¼ 1=f1 þ expðh0 þ h1 kÞg;
where ð0 ; 1 Þ are free parameters. The probability of division
decreases with the generation whenever 1 > 0, and increases
otherwise (29).
A2. The mitotic cycle duration (referred to below as the
time to division) of any progenitor cell was modeled as a
nonnegative random variable with cumulative distribution
function (cdf ) FðÞ, whereas their time to differentiation
(calculated from the time of last cell division) was modeled
as a nonnegative random variable with c.d.f. GðÞ. On the basis
of past studies (27, 29, 30), these 2 distributions were allowed
to be dissimilar, so the time to division could be stochastically
shorter/longer than the time to differentiation, if needed. Both
distributions were assumed not to change with generation (8,
29), and were taken from the family of 2-parameter gamma
distributions. Write m1 and s 21 (resp. m2 and s 22 ) for the mean
and variance of the time to division (resp. differentiation).
A3. The traditional independence assumptions for branching
processes are adopted (32–34). Time-lapse experiments (29)
suggested that significant correlation might exist between the
time to division of sister cells. However, such dependencies have
little effect on the behavior of branching processes, and, for
instance, do not affect the expected cell counts (39–41).
The expected numbers of O-2A/OPCs and oligodendrocytes

for variances of cell numbers are more complicated but can
also be derived (30).
Model assumptions under drug exposure
To describe the temporal development of clones transiently
exposed to a sublethal dose of drug, we account for the possible
changes that a drug may induce on the fate of O-2A/OPCs and
on the timing of their division and their differentiation (Fig. 1B).
Although the model presented below considers only the case of

a drug that induces differentiation of O-2A/OPCs into oligodendrocytes (such as BCNU), alternative models could be
similarly developed for when drug exposure promotes selfrenewal division.
B1. The process begins at time t ¼ 0 with a single progenitor
cell of generation 1.
B2. Every cell that completes its lifespan prior to the time of
drug exposure obeys assumptions (A1–A3).
B3. Every cell exposed to the drug before dividing or
differentiating is subject to changes defined by the following
assumptions, which rely on an experimental observation that
BCNU causes O2A/OPCs to differentiate (5, 6).
(i) An O-2A/OPC that intended to divide before being
exposed to the drug will change its fate with probability
q, and differentiate into an oligodendrocyte instead of
dividing. In such circumstances, the time to differentiation calculated from the time of drug exposure is
modeled by a nonnegative random variable with c.d.f.
Gtreated ðÞ, assumed gamma with mean mtreated and
variance s 2treated . In contrast, if the cell fate does not
change, the duration between drug exposure and the
cell division is reduced/increased by a factor  relative
to how long this duration would have been if the cell
had not been exposed to the drug.
(ii) An O-2A/OPC that intended to differentiate into an
oligodendrocyte before drug exposure will not change
its fate. However, the duration between the time of drug
exposure and the time of differentiation may be altered,
and this duration is reduced/increased by a factor r
relative to how long it would have been if the cell had
not been exposed to the drug.
B4. O-2A/OPCs born after drug exposure obey assumptions
(A1–A3), except that
(iii) Their probability of division may differ from those of
O-2A/OPCs that proliferate in untreated clones.
Denoting by qk the probability of division of generation-k O-2A/OPCs born after the time of drug exposure, we set
qk ¼ minfa  pk ; 1g;
where  is a free parameter capturing an increase ( >
1) or a reduction ( < 1 ) in the probability of division
of O-2A/OPCs postexposure, and quantifying a residual effect of chemotherapy.
The times to division and the times to differentiation differ from those of O-2A/OPCs that proliferate in
untreated clones by constant factors r and . We
therefore assumed that the times to division and
the times to differentiation were gamma distributed

The model parameters, including the means and variances
of the time to division and of the time to differentiation, the
probability of division, and parameters describing the effects
of the drug, were estimated using the method of simulated
pseudo-maximum likelihood (refs. 27, 28, 30, 31; see also
Supplementary Materials). Their standard errors were computed using the method of Bootstrap (42).

Results
Experimental results
The evolution over time of clonal compositions in control
and treated groups were significantly different (Fig. 2),
suggesting that BCNU was able to disrupt the processes
of division and differentiation of O-2A/OPCs. Transient
BCNU exposure reduced the number of progenitors per
clone, and increased the number of oligodendrocytes shortly
after drug exposure. Over time, however, the mean number
of oligodendrocytes increased faster in untreated than in
treated clones. These results could occur for multiple reasons. One possibility is that BCNU increased the probability
that O-2A/OPCs will exit the cell cycle and differentiate into
oligodendrocytes. It is also possible that drug exposure
lengthened the cell cycle time (such that treated cells
divided later), or that the period of time between the final
cell division and differentiation into an oligodendrocyte was
shortened. These alterations in precursor functions also
could happen in combination.
Model-based analysis of in vitro data
Using our mathematical model, we investigated the effects
of BCNU on the clonal compositions. The resulting parameter
estimates and their standard errors are shown in Table 1.
Untreated clones. The mean time to division of O-2A/
OPCs (defined as the average time separating 2 successive cell
divisions) in untreated clones was estimated as 25:5  10:8
hours (mean  SD), consistent with past analyses (29). The
time to differentiation of untreated O-2A/OPCs lasted for
24:9  4:5 hours, suggesting that the times required for O2A/OPCs to divide or to differentiate into oligodendrocytes
were on average virtually identical. The probability of division
of O-2A/OPCs decreased with each generation, but only
slightly; the probability of division of founder cells was close
to 0.83, and decreased to 0.75 after 7 divisions. These estimates were higher than those previously reported (24–29); the
larger numbers of O-2A/OPCs per clone observed in the present experiment support this difference.
BCNU-treated clones. Drug exposure seemed to alter cell
proliferation and differentiation in multiple ways. First, BCNU
exposure increased the time to division in O-2A/OPCs. We
estimated that the residual mitotic cycle duration (defined as the
duration between the time of drug exposure and the time at
which the cell divides) was on average 2.5 times longer in O-2A/
OPCs directly exposed to BCNU during their lifespan (i.e., before
washing out the drug) than in O-2A/OPCs of untreated clones
(40 versus 16 hours). In contrast with the lengthening of cell
cycle time in progenitor cells exposed to BCNU, our analysis
indicated that the residual time to differentiation (the duration

BCNU exposure altered the balance between self-renewal of

O-2A/OPCs and their differentiation into oligodendrocytes

differentiation of progenitor cells into oligodendrocytes.

otherwise would have divided before drug exposure now
underwent differentiation.
Once BCNU was washed out, the cell cycle length and the
probabilities of division returned to the values displayed by
untreated cells. The time to differentiation of O-2A/OPCs generated post-exposure, however, was estimated as 30% shorter on
average in treated than in untreated clones (17.4 versus 24.9
hours). Thus, with the potential exception of the time to differentiation, transient exposure to BCNU did not cause impairments in progenitor cell function that were passed on to the
next generation of progenitor cells. Note that the estimated
difference in the mean time to differentiation induced only small
changes in the numbers of O-2A/OPCs and oligodendrocytes.
Model-based predictions
Stationary conditions. Under normal conditions, a stationary population of precursor and terminally differentiated
cells is thought to regulate its balance by letting precursor
cells divide or differentiate in equal frequency (e.g., by means
of asymmetric division). Our branching process achieves
"stationarity" if the probability of division is set to pk ¼ :5,
in which case the model is said to be critical. The mean
number of precursor cells at any time t generated by any
precursor cell born at time 0 reduces to

as tR! ¥ (see Supplementary
Materials), where
R
mF ¼ x  dFðxÞ and mG ¼ x  dGðxÞ denote the mean time
to division and the mean time to differentiation of precursor
cells. It is worth noting that the mean number of precursor cells
will stabilize around 1 only if the mean time to division and the
mean time to differentiation are identical (i.e., mF ¼ mG ); otherwise it will increase to a value different from 1 (< 1 when
mF > mG , and conversely when mF <mG ), even though every
precursor cell generates on average 1 precursor cell. Therefore,
by modifying only mF and mG , and leaving unchanged the
probability of division, one can modulate the limiting value
m¥precursor , which may fall anywhere in ð:5; ¥Þ. For instance,
with a mitotic cycle duration twice as long as the time to
differentiation, the mean number of precursor cells approaches
m¥precursor ¼ ð2mG þ mG Þ=4mG ¼ 0:75, as t increases.
The stability of a stationary precursor cell population may
be disrupted either by changing the probability of division to a
value P different than 1/2 or by altering the timing of division
and/or differentiation of precursor cells. Using numerical
investigations, we evaluated the effects of hypothetical drug
exposures on the population size when these effects persist
over time and when they are transient.
The effects of drug exposure on the probability of division
and the timing of division/differentiation persist over time
either because they are passed to cells of subsequent generations at division, or because drug exposure lasts an extended
period of time.

If the change in the probability of division persists over
time, the pools of precursor cells and of terminally differentiated cells will gradually deplete if P < 1/2, whereas both
populations will expand if P > 1/2 (Fig. 3). Small changes in
the probability of division can dramatically affect the population size. For instance, 10 days postexposure, the average
number of precursor cells decreases by almost 20% by lowering the probability of division from 0.50 to 0.49.
If the mean time to division and/or the mean time to differentiation remain altered for an extended time period, the
number of precursor cells will either increase or decrease,
and converge to a value determined by equation (1), with mF
and mG replaced by their altered values (Fig. 3). For example, if
the mean time to division and the mean time to differentiation
were identical before drug exposure, and if drug exposure
resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the mean time to division
and a 0.85-fold decrease in the mean time to differentiation (as
estimated for BCNU using clonal experiments), the number of
precursor cells would become 33% smaller than under normal
conditions (where 0:33 ¼ ðmnormal  mtreated Þ=mnormal , with
mnormal ¼ 1 and mtreated ¼ ð2:5 þ 0:85Þ=ð2  2:5Þ). Thus, the
population would stabilize again, but to a level lower than the
one existing prior to drug exposure.
When the probability of division and the timing of division
and differentiation are transiently altered, so that these parameters eventually return to their pre-exposure values (as
seemed to be the case for BCNU), the temporal behavior of
the number of precursor cells will depend on the type of
changes induced by the drug. If the drug alters only the timing
of division and/or differentiation for a limited time period, the
asymptotic mean number of cells will still obey equation (1),
such that the population will spontaneously recover over time
and return to its original size, thereby leaving ultimately no
sign of a drug exposure on the population size. In contrast, if
drug exposure modulates transiently the probability of division such that precursor cells may change their fate (e.g.,
differentiate instead of divide), the population size will stop
decreasing or increasing after drug removal but will not return
to its pre-exposure level, making drug effects permanent,
unless a therapeutic intervention is used.
Therapeutic strategies. Therapeutic interventions modulating the probability of division of precursor cells and/or the
timing of their division/differentiation could be developed to
restore impaired neural populations. As shown in Figure 4, the
benefit of an intervention obtained by altering the timing of
division and/or differentiation endures only while therapy is
maintained. Once therapy is interrupted so that the mean
time to division and the mean time to differentiation become
identical to those existing pretherapy, the population size will
return to its preintervention level as if no therapy had ever
been used. Thus, the gains in cell number attributable to
changes in the timing of division/differentiation would offer
no long-term benefits. This phenomenon follows from identity
(1), which states that the long-term mean number of cells is
solely determined by the mean time to division and the mean
time to differentiation of precursor cells. In contrast, therapies
modulating the probability of division will have long-lasting
benefits; that is, once the intervention is stopped, cell gains

The Effects of Chemotherapy on Neuroglial Precursors

Figure 3. Precursor cell numbers
during drug exposure (started at
t ¼ 0) relative to absence of
exposure as a function of time.
The calculations assumed a
branching process model of a
population of precursor and
terminally differentiated cells in
which, in the absence of drug
exposure: (a) the events of division
and differentiation are equally
likely for every precursor cell; (b)
the times to division and the times
to differentiation of precursor cells
are identically distributed,
exponential with mean 24 hours.
The calculations assumed further
that drug exposure changed either
the probability of division (P; left),
or the mean time to division
(m1 ; middle), or the mean time to
differentiation (m2 ; right).

to chemotherapy at 24 hours and without intervention (dashed lines ); after transient exposure to chemotherapy at 24 hours and a therapeutic intervention (e.g.,
growth factor application to enhance neural progenitor cell proliferation or other neuroprotective agents) started at 48 hours (dash-dotted); after transient exposure to
chemotherapy at 24 hours and to therapeutic intervention between 48 and 450 hours (–). Chemotherapy was assumed to transiently reduce the probability of division
by 36%, increase the time to completion of division by 2.5, and reduce the time to differentiation by 0.85 (as estimated for BCNU using our clonal data). Left,
intervention decreases the mean time to division; continued 2-fold decrease (dash-dotted); temporary 4-fold decrease (solid). Right, the intervention increases only
the probability of division from 0.5 to 0.51 or 0.53. The parameter values and time scale used in these simulations were selected arbitrarily.

will persist. Small increases in the probability of division may
result in a rapid recovery of the cell population.

Discussion
Our present studies reveal that a single transient exposure
of O-2A/OPCs to levels of BCNU equivalent to 10% or 15% of
that achieved in low dose clinical applications was sufficient
to alter several parameters of progenitor cell function. These
changes include lengthening of the cell cycle, shortening of the
time between final division and differentiation, and a reduction in the probability that a progenitor cell will undergo selfrenewing division. Although effects on cell cycle time and
probability of the occurrence of a self-renewing division were
only seen in progenitors exposed to BCNU, the effects of these
changes on clonal composition became larger over time.
Moreover, transient exposure resulted in smaller clones, a
lesser proportion of progenitor cells per clone, and ultimately
a reduction in the total number of oligodendrocytes in clones.
Although it is well recognized that exposure to chemotherapy can damage multiple tissues of the body, there seems to be
no prior information on the ability of chemotherapeutic
agents to alter cell cycle length, time to differentiation or
probability of self-renewal in dividing precursor cells. Moreover, our studies seem to provide the first demonstration that
cell cycle length and the time between final division and
differentiation can be changed in opposite directions.
Although induction of cell death is one means of reducing
the numbers of precursor cells available for normal tissue
maintenance or repair, such reductions can also come about,
for instance, by disrupting the normal balance between selfrenewing division and differentiation into nondividing progeny. It is also possible to reduce new cell generation simply by
increasing the cell cycle length of a dividing progenitor cell, so
that fewer cells are generated within any given time period.
It was of particular interest that the transient perturbations
in cell cycle length and probability of differentiation lead to
changes in clonal composition that become more pronounced
over time. There is little understanding of the processes that
lead to the appearance of neurologic and/or pathologic
changes weeks or months after chemotherapy has been
completed. Because of the importance of precursor cells in
normal tissue homeostasis, small perturbations during drug
exposure can have effects that are observed more clearly at
later time points. This phenomenon indicates that sublethal
disruption of precursor cell function needs to be analyzed in a
manner that reflects the cumulative nature of developmental
and homeostatic processes. Numerical investigations (Fig. 4)
suggested that drugs altering normal precursor cells could
have rapidly occurring effects. Drug effects in vivo are often
detected at delayed time points because cell turnover is likely
to be slower in vivo than in vitro, and also because endpoints
observed during in vivo studies differ from those considered in
our in vitro experiments and numerical simulations. Recent
studies support the concept that there is substantial contribution of new oligodendrocytes to myelinated tracts throughout life (43). Together with findings that oligodendrocytes
themselves are highly vulnerable to multiple chemotherapeu-

tic agents (5, 6), reductions in the progenitor cell pool caused
even by increasing the probability of differentiation during the
time of drug exposure could limit efficacy of subsequent
repair/homeostasis by reducing the total number of available
progenitors. Analysis of the effects of higher drug levels of
BCNU in vivo revealed a transient increase in cell death, but a
long-lasting reduction in the number of dividing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (5), suggesting that this population
does not become replenished in vivo.
The results derived from our stochastic model offer possible
explanations of the long-lasting effects of chemotherapy on
normal cells of the CNS that have been observed in both clinical
studies and animalmodels of neurotoxicity. We found that small
changes in self-renewal probability can severely reduce the
number of cells within a relatively short period of time, even
in situations in which it seems that the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent on precursorcell functiondo not persist once drug
exposure is terminated. Even if precursor cell functions were to
return to their normal values after drug exposure, our simulations demonstrate that this would not be sufficient to promote
recovery of cell number. As cell division in the CNS remains at
reduced levels for prolonged periods after cessation of treatment with BCNU, cisplatin, 5-FU, and cytarabine (5, 6), this
would further compromise normal repair and/or homeostasis.
Cell kinetics may be impacted by the microenvironment,
contact inhibition, or any other feedback mechanisms, the
potential contributions of which were not explicitly described
by our model. For instance, contact inhibition may likely
promote cell renewal when cell density decreases, and vice
versa when the density increases. Our past studies, including
time-lapse experiments (29), did not, however, support any
association between cell density and cell cycle length in vitro.
The role played by these mechanisms in the damaged CNS of
cancer patients remains unclear. Although not comprehensive, our model was still useful in studying the potential effects
of chemotherapy on precursor cells of the CNS in vivo, and in
deciphering the consequences of, for example, a simple modulation of the time to division or the time to differentiation.
Additional studies should be conducted to assess the broader
applicability of our conclusions.
The discovery of chemotherapeutic agents with limited toxicity for the normal cells of the organism is one of the central
challenges in the field of cancer treatment. The approaches
provided by our present studies offer highly sensitive means of
examining subtle adverse effects. Moreover, the principles that
underlie these quantitative approaches are sufficiently general
as to make them applicable to the analysis of any cellular
perturbation that alters cell division or differentiation.
