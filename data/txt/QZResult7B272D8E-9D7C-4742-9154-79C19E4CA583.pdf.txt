Abstract
Targeting specifically primary prostate cancer (PCa) cells for immune therapy,
gene therapy or molecular imaging is of high importance. The PCA3 long non-coding
RNA is a unique PCa biomarker and oncogene that has been widely studied. This
gene has been mainly exploited as an accurate diagnostic urine biomarker for PCa
detection. In this study, the PCA3 promoter was introduced into a new transcriptional
amplification system named the 3-Step Transcriptional Amplification System (PCA33STA) and cloned into type 5 adenovirus. PCA3-3STA activity was highly specific for
PCa cells, ranging between 98.7- and 108.0-fold higher than that for benign primary
prostate epithelial or non-PCa cells, respectively. In human PCa xenografts, PCA33STA displayed robust bioluminescent signals at levels that are sufficient to translate
to positron emission tomography (PET)-based reporter imaging. Remarkably, when
freshly isolated benign or cancerous prostate biopsies were infected with PCA3-3STA,
the optical signal produced from primary PCa biopsies was significantly higher than
from benign prostate biopsies (4.4-fold, p < 0.0001). PCA3-3STA therefore represents
a PCa-specific expression system with the potential to target, with high accuracy,
primary or metastatic PCa epithelial cells for imaging, vaccines, or gene therapy.

INTRODUCTION

delivery [5]. However, the relatively weak activity of
many tumor-specific promoters has limited this approach.
To circumvent this limitation, investigators have used
several techniques to amplify promoter signals [3, 6, 7].
One of these approaches, the two-step transcriptional
amplification (TSTA) system, has been successfully
adapted for optical and PET-based molecular imaging as
well as for gene therapy [7-10]. We recently demonstrated
that the amplification provided by the TSTA driven by
the prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter (PSEBC)
was strong enough to image transcriptional activity in the
prostate of large immunocompetent mammals following
ultrasound-guided transrectal injection and using a clinical
PET imaging apparatus [5]. Despite the high translational

Inrecent years, wide-array genomic analysis has
provided a better understanding of the molecular changes
occurring during prostate epithelial cell transformation
and progression in aggressive cancers [1]. Exploitation of
these transcriptional alterations in vivo is among several
approaches, which can be used to better treat, prognose, or
image prostate cancers (PCa) [2-4]. The prostate provides
a unique anatomical location to deliver transcription
expression-based nanotechnologies directly into the
organ through transrectal ultrasound-guided injections,
thereby avoiding systemic biodistribution and poor target

does the current benchmark TSTA method. When driven
by the PCA3 promoter, the 3STA allows for sensitive
primary PCa detection, thus significantly improves the
translational potential of the PCA3 transcription-based

potential of these technologies, their ability to detect
primary PCa in vivo remains unchartered territory.
PCA3/DD3 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is an
oncogene overexpressed by up to 60-fold in PCa compared
to benign epithelial cells [11, 12]. Its abundant expression
in PCa is controlled in part through transcription and
is expressed from precancerous lesions (prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)) to metastases [13, 14]. In
the clinical setting, it is used as a promising biomarker
and as an adjunct to serum PSA or to magnetic resonance
imaging to determine the risk of PCa prior to biopsy [15,
16]. Unfortunately, because of its weak activity, the PCA3
promoter was not successfully exploited to target PCa
cells.
In this study, we present a new transcriptional
amplification system, referred to as 3STA (three-step
transcriptional amplification), which boosts expression

RESULTS

rational to exploit the specificity of its promoter in PCa
diagnostic or therapeutic approaches. Unfortunately, PCA3
promoter activity is weak and as a result has not raised
much interest [17, 18]. To address this limitation, we first
investigated whether its activity could be amplified once
introduced within a transcriptional amplification system
such as the TSTA (Figure 1A and 1B).
The TSTA system has three components: a specific
promoter (e.g. PCA3 promoter), an amplifier (GAL4VP16
fusion protein), and a reporter gene (Figure 1A). The
specificity of TSTA is dictated by the promoter that drives
GAL4VP16 to initiate the transcriptional amplification of
the system. Because Verhaegh et al. have shown that the
minimal region (-152 to +62 bp of AF279290 sequence)
of the PCA3 promoter was more active in the PCa LNCaP
cell line than other non-PCa cells, we have used this
sequence as a driver of the TSTA system. As expected,
when the PCA3 proximal promoter (-152 to +62 bp) was
cloned into the TSTA, its observed activity was higher
than the non-amplified promoter (Figure 1B). However,
the amplification provided was mild in the LAPC4, PC-3,
and DU145 PCa cell lines.
To further increase the amplification provided by the
TSTA, five copies of the GAL4-response elements and the
adenoviral E4 gene minimal promoter [19] were cloned
upstream of the PCA3 promoter (Figure 1A). This system,
referred to as the 3-Step Transcriptional Amplification
system (3STA), amplifies the PCA3 promoter in three
steps: (1) production of the GAL4VP16 fusion protein
under the control of the PCA3 promoter; (2) binding of
GAL4VP16 onto the GAL4 response element (GAL4RE)
upstream of the GAL4VP16 and firefly luciferase (fl)
genes; and (3) overexpression of the GAL4VP16 to further
amplify fl reporter gene expression as a positive feedback
loop (Figure 1A). Since the TSTA activator and amplifier
cassette orientations within the viral genome have been
shown to be important for signal specificity [20], we
compared the activator and amplifier cassette orientations
and their respective activities in four cancer cell lines
(Figure S1A). As shown (Figure S1B), the tail-to-tail (TT)
orientation provided the best amplification signal without
changing the PCA3-3STA specificity for the PCa cell lines.
Hence, we used the PCA3-3STA-TT conformation for all
of our subsequent studies. As shown in Figure 1B, the fl
activity of the PCA3-3STA is dramatically amplified. In
fact, PCA3-3STA was shown to amplify reporter activity
by 94.5- and 20.2-fold, compared to that of PCA3-Luc,
and 2.3 and 7.6-fold compared to that of PCA3-TSTA in
22Rv1 and LAPC4, respectively.

cell line 22Rv1 to that in the bladder cancer cell line
SW780. We first showed that adenoviral infectivity is
comparable in 22Rv1 (PCa) and SW780 (bladder cancer)
cells as infection with increasing multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of a constitutive CMV-driven green fluorescent
protein (GFP) adenovirus showed comparable GFP
expression (Figure 2A). In contrast, using a PCA3-3STA
driven fl adenovirus, the fl activity increased with MOI
only in the PCa cells (Figure 2B). The highly amplified
PCA3-3STA activity was restricted to PCa cell lines
(22Rv1, LAPC4, PC-3 and DU145) but remained inactive
in benign prostate cell lines (PZ-HPV7 and WPMY-1)
and non-prostate carcinoma cell lines such as SW780
(bladder), MGHU3 (bladder) and HepG2 (hepatic) (Figure
1B and 2C). Remarkably, the 22Rv1/SW780 activity
ratio (specificity ratio) increased from 2.6 for PCA3-Luc
alone to 108.0 with PCA3-3STA (Figure 2C, not shown
for PCA3-Luc). Furthermore, PCA3-3STA exhibited
negligible activity in primary benign prostate epithelial
cells harvested from prostate biopsies (NPC1, and NPC2,
specificity ratio 22Rv1/NPC2=98.7)) which are not
immortalized by viral proteins as in the case of PZ-HPV7
and WPMY-1 (Figure 2D).
Next we assessed the androgen inducibility of
PCA3-driven amplification system, which in turn would
inform us on its utility in targeting castration-resistant
PCa cells (CRPC). As shown in (Figure 2E and 2F) the
androgen-responsive PSA-derived PSEBC-TSTA activity
[21] was highly induced in the presence of androgen
(DHT) over that under AR blockade (with bicalutamide)
in both LAPC4 and 22Rv1 (13.81- and 2.69-fold,
respectively). In contrast, PCA3-3STA system is not
androgen dependent. Upon DHT treatment of LAPC4
and 22Rv1, its activity was 1.98- and 0.68-fold that of
without DHT, respectively (Figure 2E and 2F). Moreover,
contrary to PSEBC-TSTA, PCA3-3STA remained active
in androgen receptor (AR)-negative prostate cancer
cells (PC-3 and DU145, Figure 1B and 2C) while it
was silent in AR-positive breast cancer cells (CAMA-1,
Supplemental Figure S2). A prerequisite of robust in vivo
activity is the ability to maintain persistent expression in
cells. Thus, we characterized the dynamics of the 3STA
system in a time course experiment conducted for 96h and
compared it with the TSTA system (Figure S3). PCA3TSTA and PCA3-3STA displayed similar amplifications
during 48h, after which time the PCA3-TSTA reached a
plateau while PCA3-3STA activity continued to increase.
This correlated with a higher level of GAL4VP16 protein
at 72 and 96h for the 3STA, indicating that the enhanced
amplification was due in part to the higher activation of
the 3STA system by the increased GAL4VP16 protein
expression (Figure S3).
To this point, our data demonstrated that the novel
PCA3-3STA system we have generated can amplify
expression via PCA3 promoter by over 95-fold. But,
importantly, this transcriptionally-based gene expression

rely on androgens for its activity.

this purpose, biopsies were taken from cancer-bearing
prostates following a radical prostatectomy or from benign
prostates following a radical cystoprostatectomy (surgery
performed to remove urinary bladder and prostate gland
from bladder cancers patients) and the resulting samples
were cultured for 72h in the presence of the PCA3-3STA
adenovirus (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4B and 4C,
PCa cells kept PSA and AMACR expression and kept
proliferating (as depicted by positive Ki67 staining)
despite adenoviral infection. Moreover, the location of
luciferase expression was confirmed to be located into
PCa cells by IHC while stromal cells did not express the
reporter gene (Figure 4B and 4C). More interestingly,
a statistically significant higher fl signal was observed
within the primary PCa biopsies than in the benign
prostate biopsies harvested from radical cystectomy
specimens (Figure 5). When the luciferase activities of
PCA3-3STA transduced biopsies harvested from PCa
patients were compared to that of non-PCa patients, the
fl activity was 4.4-fold higher in the PCa biopsy-group
(Figure 5A and 5B, Average radiance 35 649±17 919 p/s/
cm2) than in the non-PCa biopsy group (Average radiance
8 072±8940 p/s/cm2) and the difference was statistically
significant (p < 0.0001). Because PCa is not uniformly
spread through the glands and the density of prostate
epithelial cells could be responsible for the observed
difference between benign and malignant tissues, we also

PCA3-3STA directs a robust expression in vivo in
PCa tumor models
Because one of the most promising applications of
the PCA3-3STA system is in intraprostatic imaging, we
compared its activity in vivo with that of the PSEBCTSTA system which we showed as being sensitive enough
to image intraprostatic PSA promoter activity by PET in
large immunocompetent mammals [5]. Figure 3 shows
that following intratumoral injections of PCA3-3STA
in 22Rv1 and LAPC4 mice xenografts, we were able to
detect a strong bioluminescent signal comparable to that
of the PSEBC-TSTA system, which suggests that PCA33STA may be sensitive enough to image intraprostatic
PCA3 transcriptional activity by PET [5].

PCA3-3STA can detect primary PCa
In another key step to ensure the significant clinical
translational potential of this system, we tested the capacity
of PCA3-3STA to target primary PCa cells, as most of the
cell lines tested were isolated from metastatic PCa. For

significant difference was observed between the PCA3-3STA and PSEBC-TSTA fl activity in the two cell lines tested.

evaluated the maximal radiance into each biopsy. Again,
the radical prostatectomy group had significantly higher
maximal radiance than the radical cystoprostatectomy
group (Figure 5C, Max radiance=1 790 058±610 571 vs
539 638±568 550 p/s, p < 0.0001). As additional controls,
we have infected separate biopsies from the same patients
with an SV40 promoter driven fl adenovirus and did not

the two groups (p = 0.27, data not shown). These results
thus confirm that the PCA3-3STA system is indeed capable
of specifically targeting primary PCa.

In this study, we present a new transcriptional
expression system, the PCA3-3STA, which specifically
targets PCa cells in both primary PCa biopsies and
PCa cell lines harvested from metastatic patients. By
combining the promoter of a highly PCa-specific gene and
a new transcriptional amplification system (3STA), we put
forth that the PCA3-3STA system may be developed as
a promising PCa-specific expression system not only for
imaging but also for gene or immune therapy.

after surgical removal. The biopsy cores are then co-cultured with PCA3-3STA adenovirus during 24 h after which they are cultured for
48 h on a Gelfoam sponge. Three days after infection, the luciferase activity is measured using a CCD camera and is reported as p/s/

promoter, such as the PCA3 promoter, we first had to
construct and characterize the 3STA (Figure 1A), a
derivative of the TSTA that harbours extra-Gal4 binding
sites upstream of the PCA3 promoter. This enhanced
system amplifies PCA3 promoter transcription by 95-fold
(Figure 1B). Moreover, the PCA3-3STA is more specific
for PCa cells than are the previously introduced MUC1,
PSA, PEG-3 and hTERT promoter-based expression
systems that can be active in many tissues or cancer
subtypes [2, 22-24]. This is due in part to the observation
that the 3STA not only amplified the PCA3 promoter
activity, but also maintained its specificity for prostate
cancer cells. In fact, none of the many non-PCa cell lines,
nor primary benign epithelial cell lines or biopsies studied

(Figures 2C, 2D, S1B, S2, 5) showed significant PCA33STA activity when compared to PCa cells.
The data therefore suggest that once amplified by
3STA, the PCA3 promoter activity displays specificity
similar to that of PCA3 lncRNA for PCa, which is known
to be overexpressed from localized PCa to CRPC [11, 25,
26]. Its activity also matches that of PCA3 RNA that does
not correlate with Gleason scores or pathological stage
and is consistent with a high sensitivity for PCa detection
using its promoter as a driver of 3STA. The underlying
mechanisms of high PCA3 promoter specificity for
cancerous prostate glands are as yet unknown. Verhaegh et
al. clearly showed that the PCA3 (-152 to +62 bp) promoter
displayed the strongest activity in LNCaP cells secondary

PCA3-3STA system is not designed solely for imaging, it
could also be modified for gene or immunotherapy. With
the recent clinical studies showing the effectiveness of the
Sipuleucel-T and Prost-VAC immunotherapies in PCa,
as well as the advent in clinics of checkpoint inhibitors
[28], this system could be used to drive immunomodulator
cytokines and/or cytotoxic genes to initiate a local or
systemic immune response following intraprostatic
injection. Indeed, the ability to combine transrectal
intraprostatic delivery of the vector (avoiding adenoviral
biodistribution problems), the PCa specificity of the PCA3
promoter in primary PCa and the amplification provided
by the 3STA make this system highly translational.
We acknowledge that our study did have its
limitations. First, we did not directly demonstrate that
the PCA3-3STA was capable of imaging PCA3 promoter
activity using a clinical PET, as previously shown with
the PSEBC promoter. We do believe, however, that
because PCA3-3STA showed a higher specificity and
sensitivity comparable to that of the PSEBC-TSTA, the
potential of our system for immuno- and gene therapy
or imaging certainly parallels and may even exceed that
of previously reported vectors [5, 17]. Moreover, given
that PCA3-3STA was PCa-specific, it was not possible to
show its activity in large immunocompetent mammals,
as it was performed for PSEBC-TSTA, which may image
AR-dependent transcriptional activity in benign prostate
epithelial cells [5]. Finally, the adenovirus as a delivery
method may be subject to reluctance for security and
biodistribution. However, we, as well as others, have
shown that the prostate allows intratumoral transrectal
adenovirus delivery and is therefore a unique cancer site
easy to target [29]. Also, other delivery methods such as
liposomes could be used to deliver the PCA3-3STA.

to an unidentified DNA-binding protein between the -29
and -63 nucleotides [18]. However, while the proximal
PCA3 promoter (-152 to +62 bp) did show some enhanced
promoter activity in PCa cells, compared to that of benign
or non-PCa cells, it was shown to be only 20 to 50% that
of the weak SV40 promoter [17, 18]. Because PCA3
lncRNA is overexpressed by 60-fold in PCa patients tissue
samples when compared to benign patients tissue samples,
other mechanisms than transcription seem to be involved
in PCA3 RNA overexpression in PCa [11]. Furthermore,
two groups have published on an alternative PCA3 gene
transcript (PCA3TS4) using another transcription start site,
136 bp upstream of the start site of the promoter which
we have used (PCA3TS5 promoter) [12, 25]. Because the
promoter of the PCA3TS4 transcript was not included in
the constructs used, this alternative promoter does not
contribute to the specificity observed with the 3STA.
Moreover, Salagierski et al. showed that the PCA3TS4
transcript expression levels accounted for only 1% of all
PCA3 gene transcripts, suggesting a low activity of the
promoter upstream of this transcript (so-called PCA3TS4)
[25].
Of interest is that the PCA3 lncRNA (PCA3TS5)
was androgen-induced [12, 25] whereas the PCA3-3STA
was not (Figure 2E and 2F) which is in line with the
absence of an androgen response element in the region of
the PCA3 promoter used. This is a valuable characteristic
of the system, as the ability to target both androgensensitive and -insensitive PCa is of the utmost importance,
what with the new challenges associated with CRPC
metastasis detection by imaging, a prerequisite to systemic
treatment. Recently, Salameh et al. have shown that the
PCA3 lncRNA was an oncogene targeting the PRUNE2
RNA, the later being a tumor suppressor gene in PCa
[12]. Interestingly, PCA3 RNA was shown to hybridize
to the RNA encoding PRUNE2 gene intron 6 to induce an
adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-dependent
degradation. This important study clearly shows that
PCA3 is not only a biomarker but also a driver of PCa
development and reinforce the importance to target PCA3
overexpressing cells could definitely be exploited.
Interestingly, the PCA3-3STA system shows
reporter activity comparable to that of the PSEBC-TSTA
both in vitro (Figures 2E, 2F and S2) and in vivo (Figure
3). Given the extensive work performed using the PSEBC
promoter in the TSTA system, it appears reasonable to
assume that the gene therapy or imaging capabilities
of the PCA3-3STA may be comparable to that of the
PSEBC-TSTA, particularly for lymph node metastases
or intraprostatic imaging by PET [5, 27]. The ability to
discriminate benign from cancerous cells is particularly
important in PCa, as the disease is usually low burden,
multifocal, and well differentiated, all characteristics that
limit accurate anatomical or metabolic imaging using
classical metabolic PET tracers or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Moreover, as stated above, because the

CONCLUSIONs
This study presents a new PCa-specific expression
system, the PCA3-3STA, based on the PCA3 oncogene
promoter that matches the PCA3 lncRNA expression
pattern. This system may indeed be used with significant
accuracy to target PCa epithelial cells for imaging,
vaccines, or gene therapy applications.

[17, 18]. The PCA3 promoter was cloned upstream of
the firefly luciferase (fl) gene in pENTR-L1L2 (Life
Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) to obtain pENTRL1L2-PCA3-fl. Plasmid pENTR-L1L2-PCA3-fl was
subcloned into pAd-pL-DEST by LR cloning (LR Clonase
II Plus, Life Technologies) to obtain the adenovirus PCA3fl. For the construction of the PCA3-TSTA and PCA33STA adenoviruses, we used the MultiSite Gateway® Pro
2.0 kit (Life Technologies). First, the pDONR221-L1L2
was used to obtain two different pENTR plasmids with
multiple cloning sites, pENTR-L1R5-MCS and pENTRL5R2-MCS, containing attL1/attR5 and attL5/attR2 sites,
respectively. GAL4RE (GAL4 response elements), first
component of the TSTA along with the fl gene, was PCRamplified from pSh-TSTA-fl and cloned into pENTRL1R5 to obtain pENTR-L1R5-GAL4RE-fl. GAL4VP16,
second component of the TSTA, was also amplified
from pSh-TSTA-fl. The GAL4VP16 gene downstream
of the PCA3 promoter was cloned into pENTR-L5R2 to
obtain pENTR-L5L2-PCA3-GAL4VP16. The pENTRL1R5-GAL4RE-fl and pENTR-L5L2-PCA3-GAL4VP16
plasmids were subcloned into pAd-pL-DEST by LR
cloning to generate PCA3-TSTA adenoviral plasmid. The
PCA3 promoter was replaced by the PSEBC promoter
also amplified from pSh-TSTA-fl in the above-described
plasmids to obtain the PSEBC-TSTA adenovirus. Another
set of GAL4RE was cloned upstream of the PCA3
promoter in the plasmid pENTR-L5L2-PCA3-GAL4VP16
to obtain pENTR-L5L2-GAL4RE-PCA3-GAL4VP16
which, along with pENTR-L1R5-GAL4RE-fl, was
subcloned into pAd-pL-DEST by LR cloning to obtain the
PCA3-3STA adenoviral plasmid. The adenoviral plasmids
were then transfected into 293A cells for adenovirus
production. Titers were determined using the Adeno-X™

22Rv1 (1.6 x 105/well), LAPC4 (1.6 x 105 /well),
PC-3 (6 x 104/well), DU145 (6 x 104/well), PZ-HPV-7 (8
x 104/well), WPMY-1 (8 x 104/well), MGHU3 (8 x 104/
well), SW780 (8 x 104/well), and HepG2 (7 x 104/well)
were seeded in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours later,
the PCA3-fl, PCA3-TSTA, PCA3-3STA, and SV40-fl
adenovirus were added. Seventy-two hours after infection,
cells were lysed and a luciferase assay was performed as
described (Promega). For androgen sensitivity assessment,
cells were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at
10nM or bicalutamide at 10µM (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis,
MO, USA) in 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, 24h postinfection. Luciferase assays were performed after 48 h of
treatment.

Time course experiments and western blot
analysis
22Rv1 cells (1.6 x 105/well) were seeded 24h
prior to infection with PCA3-fl, PCA3-TSTA and PCA33STA. Relative luciferase unit (RLU) was assayed at the
indicated time points for each virus. Western blot analysis
was performed on the collected lysates with 4µg of protein
and the membranes were incubated with antibodies against
β-actin (1:5000, Sc47778, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or vp16
(1:5000, ab4809, Abcam, Toronto, ON, Canada). The
secondary antibodies (1:5000) were conjugated with
IRDye™ 680-anti-mouse and IRDye™ 800-anti-rabbit
antibodies (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Proteins were
detected and the signal was quantified by means of the
Odyssey Scanning System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA).

In vivo experiments

Cell cultures

Two million 22Rv1 and LAPC4 cells mixed in
Matrigel (354262, Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada)
were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of Fox Chase
SCID beige mice (code 250, Charles River Canada, StConstant, QC, Canada). Tumors were grown for 32
days. The adenoviruses (108 infectious viral particles
(ivp)) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected
intratumorally. Ninety-six hours later, bioluminescence
was quantified using a CCD camera and is reported as p/s/
cm2 (Xenogen IVIS, Caliper Lifesciences, Woodbridge,
ON, Canada). All of the animal experiments were
approved by the Laval University animal care committee.

22Rv1 (prostate cancer cell line), CAMA-1 (breast
cancer cell line), and WPMY-1 (myofibroblast stromal
cell line) were cultured in RPMI media containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). LAPC4 (prostate cancer cell
line) and HepG2 (liver cancer cell line) were cultured in
DMEM media containing 10% FBS. PC-3 and DU145
(prostate cancer cell lines), and MGHU3 and SW780
(bladder cancer cell lines) were cultured in eMEM
media containing 10% FBS. PZ-HPV-7 and benign
primary cell cultures NPC1 and NPC2 (harvested from
prostatic biopsies) were cultured in KSFM medium (Life
Technologies), as previously described [30]. This study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
CHU de Quebec Hospital, Quebec, QC, Canada. Each
patient signed an informed consent form.

performed to treat PCa or bladder cancer, respectively
(see Supplemental Table S1). Sextants harboring PCa at
the transrectal biopsy and a nodule were targeted. The
biopsies were washed with PBS and cultured for 24 hours
in eMEM-10%FBS supplemented with 10nM DHT and
antibiotics and the PCA3-3STA (107 ivp) adenovirus under
gentle shaking. The biopsies were then transferred on a
Gelfoam soaked into fresh media for another 48h, after
which time luciferin was added and the luminescence
activity was imaged by means of Xenogen IVIS [31]. The
biopsies were then fixed in 10% formalin and embedded
in paraffin. Five-μm sections were analyzed with either
H&E staining or immuno-histochemical staining (IHC).
The luciferase IHC was performed with the IDetect Super
Stain System HRP (IDST1007, ID Laboratories, London,
ON, Canada) with anti-luciferase (1:7000, 70R12141,
Fitzgerald, Acton, MA, USA) as the primary antibody
and Donkey anti-Goat antibody (1:500, Ab6884, Abcam,
Toronto, ON, Canada) as the secondary antibody. The IHC
with the PSA, androgen receptor (AR), Ki67 or cocktail of
AMACR/p63 antibodies were performed by the clinical
pathology facility at the CHU de Quebec Hospital using a
standard clinical protocol.
