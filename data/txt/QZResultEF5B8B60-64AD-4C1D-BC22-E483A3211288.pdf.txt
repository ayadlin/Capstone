Abstract
Tumor relapses remain a serious problem after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), despite the
long-term persistence of minor histocompatibility antigen (MiHA)-specific memory CD8þ T cells specific for the
tumor. We hypothesized that these memory T cells may lose their function over time in transplanted patients.
Here, we offer functional and mechanistic support for this hypothesis, based on immune inhibition by
programmed death-1 (PD-1) expressed on MiHA-specific CD8þ T cells and the associated role of the PD-1
ligand PD-L1 on myeloid leukemia cells, especially under inflammatory conditions. PD-L1 was highly upregulated on immature human leukemic progenitor cells, whereas costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86
were not expressed. Thus, immature leukemic progenitor cells seemed to evade the immune system by inhibiting
T-cell function via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Blocking PD-1 signaling using human antibodies led to elevated
proliferation and IFN-g production of MiHA-specific T cells cocultured with PD-L1–expressing leukemia cells.
Moreover, patients with relapsed leukemia after initial MiHA-specific T-cell responses displayed high PD-L1
expression on CD34þ leukemia cells and increased PD-1 levels on MiHA-specific CD8þ T cells. Importantly,
blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions augment proliferation of MiHA-specific CD8þ memory T cells from relapsed
patients. Taken together, our findings indicate that the PD-1/PD-L pathway can be hijacked as an immune
escape mechanism in hematological malignancies. Furthermore, they suggest that blocking the PD-1 immune
checkpoint offers an appealing immunotherapeutic strategy following alloSCT in patients with recurrent or
relapsed disease. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5111–22. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Alloreactive CD8þ T cells play a crucial role in the graftversus-tumor (GVT) response following allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (alloSCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion
(DLI; ref. 1). In HLA-matched alloSCT, these alloreactive
CD8þ T-cell responses are directed against minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA; ref. 2). Previously, we have char-

acterized CD8þ T-cell immunity toward a hematopoieticrestricted MiHA, designated LRH-1, which is presented by
HLA-B7 and encoded by the P25 purinergic receptor gene
(3). LRH-1–specific CD8þ T-cell responses can be frequently
detected in myeloid leukemia patients following DLI, and has
been associated with leukemic remission (3, 4). Moreover, we
showed that CD34þ myeloid leukemia progenitor cells can be
efficiently targeted in vitro by LRH-1–specific CD8þ CTLs,
indicating that these CTLs play a significant role in graftversus-leukemia (GVL)-specific immunity. However, we have
observed that despite the presence of LRH-1–specific CD8þ
memory T (Tmem) cells for many years, late relapses do occur
in patients with advanced myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, we
noted that LRH-1–specific CD8þ Tmem cells do not always
efficiently expand with recurrence of leukemia cells, suggesting that these T cells become functionally impaired.
Mechanisms exploited by tumor cells to inhibit CD8þ Tcell–mediated immunity include disruption of antigen presentation, downregulation of HLA molecules, and induction of
immunosuppressive components such as programmed death1 (PD-1) signaling (5, 6). PD-1 plays a crucial role in T-cell
regulation in various immune responses and is involved in
peripheral tolerance, autoimmunity, infection, and antitumor
immunity (7). Elevated PD-1 expression on antigen-specific

CD8þ T cells in chronic viral infection has been recognized as
hallmark for T-cell exhaustion resulting in diminished cytokine
production, proliferation, and cytolytic activity upon antigen
restimulation (8). PD-1 binds 2 ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1; CD274)
and PD-L2 (B7-DC; CD273; ref. 7). Although PD-L2 expression is
mainly restricted to antigen presenting cells (APC) like dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages, PD-L1 is also expressed by
many nonhematological cell types (7). Furthermore, PD-L1 can
be expressed on multiple tumor types and its expression is
elevated following IFN-g exposure (9). PD-L1 molecules on
tumor cells can deliver negative signals through PD-1 to tumorreactive CTL, thereby inhibiting antitumor immunity (10). In
agreement, PD-L1 expression has been associated with poor
prognosis in various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma (9, 11). Notably, studies in models of
murine myeloid leukemia have also shown that PD-1/PD-L1
interactions play an important role in immune evasion (12, 13).
Interestingly, PD-L1 is also able to bind CD80, resulting in T-cell
inhibition (14). Therefore, PD-L1 molecules on human leukemia cells may restrain CD8þ T-cell responses involved in GVL
immunity after alloSCT.
In this study, we examined the role of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions in functional impairment of MiHA-specific CD8þ T
cells. We observed that PD-L1 on myeloid leukemia cells is
induced following IFN-g and TNF-a exposure. Furthermore,
we observed that activated LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells
express PD-1 during the course of the immune response.
Importantly, we showed that blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions using clinical grade human antibodies increases the
proliferation and IFN-g production of MiHA-specific CD8þ T
cells when stimulated with PD-L1–expressing acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and DC. Together, these findings
indicate that the PD-1 signaling pathway suppresses MiHAspecific CD8þ T-cell responses and PD-1 blockade may be an
attractive approach to boost GVL immunity in patients with
recurrent or relapsed disease.

Materials and Methods
Patient and donor material
Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples of
leukemia patients have been collected after written informed
consent in ongoing clinical SCT protocols approved by the
RUNMC Institutional Review Board. We used PB mononuclear
cells (PBMC) obtained from transplanted patients who developed MiHA-specific CD8þ T-cell responses. Patient 1 (Pt 1)
suffered from accelerated phase (AP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and was successfully treated with therapeutic DLI
after alloSCT (3). However, the patient relapsed 4 years after
DLI. Patient 2 (Pt 2) suffered from AML and developed an
LRH-1–specific CD8þ T-cell response upon preemptive DLI,
but developed extramedullary relapses without leukemic
involvement in BM (4). Characteristics of these and other
transplanted patients are included in Table 2.
DCs were generated from monocytes isolated from PBMC
of healthy donors by plastic adherence. Immature DCs (iDC)
were generated by culturing adherent monocytes in X-VIVO
15 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 2% HS, 500 U/mL

interleukin (IL)-4, and 800 U/mL Granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (both Immunotools).
After 3 days, cells were harvested, used for T-cell stimulations
experiments or further cultured as described before (15). At
day 8, mature DCs (mDC) were harvested and used in T-cell
stimulation experiments. LRH-1–specific CD8þ CTL culture
RP1 was isolated from CML-AP Pt 1 and was cultured as
described previously (4). Before use in T-cell stimulation
experiments, leukemia samples and DCs were cultured overnight with or without 100 U/mL IFN-g and 1.25 ng/mL TNF-a
(both Immunotools).
Mixed lymphocyte AML reactions and CTL stimulation
assays
After culturing and preincubation, AML cells and DCs were
washed, counted, and seeded in 96-well round bottom plates
(Corning Costar). In lymphocyte AML reaction assays, allogeneic CD3þ T cells were isolated by direct magnetic labeling
with the appropriate MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) following
the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, 104 CD3þ T
cells were added to AML cells and mDCs at different E:T ratios.
In MiHA-specific T-cell expansion assays, PD-L1þ iDCs were
loaded with 10 mmol/L LRH-1 peptide TPNQRQNVC for 30
minutes at room temperature and cocultured with LRH-1–
specific CTL RP1 at a stimulation ratio of 10:1.
Blocking antibodies were added at a final concentration of
10 mg/mL. Antibodies to PD-1 (BMS-936558; MDX-1106; and
ONO-4538) and PD-L1 (BMS-936559 and MDX-1105) and a
matching immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 isotype control were kindly
provided by Dr. A. Korman (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Biologics
Discovery). BMS-936558 and BMS-936559 are genetically engineered, fully human IgG4 antibodies currently evaluated in
clinical trials for selected tumor treatments (16). All cocultures
were performed in a total volume of 200 mL Iscove's modified
Dulbecco's medium (IMDM)/10% HS. After 5 days of coculture, supernatant was harvested for cytokine analysis. At day 5,
0.5 mCi [3H]-thymidine (Perkin Elmer) was added to each well.
After overnight incubation, [3H]-thymidine incorporation was
measured using a 1205 Wallac Betaplate counter (Perkin
Elmer).
MiHA-specific Tmem-cell proliferation assays
MiHA-specific CD8þ T cells present in PBMC from patients
Pt 1, 2, and 15 to 21 (Table 2) were stimulated for 1 to 3
consecutive weeks ex vivo with either MiHA peptide alone or
with MiHA peptide-loaded PD-L1þ iDC or PD-L1þ PD-L2þ
mDC as described previously (15). PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking
antibodies were added at a final concentration of 10 mg/mL.
After 5 days, 500 mL supernatant was removed and fresh
IMDM/10% HS containing 50 U/mL IL-2 and 5 ng/mL IL-15
(Immunotools) was added. At day 7, cells were harvested,
counted, and the percentage of MiHA-tetramerþ CD8þ T cells
was determined.
Flowcytometry
Expression of co-signaling ligands on myeloid leukemia
cells and DCs was analyzed by staining with the following
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: CD14 (Dako), CD3,

PD-1 Signaling Impairs MiHA-Specific CD8þ T Cells

CD34, CD117, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86 (all from Beckman
Coulter), anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 (both from Becton Dickinson), and isotype controls IgG1 FITC/PE dual-color control
(Dako) and IgG2b PE (Beckman Coulter). PD-1 expression on
and the percentage of MiHA-specific CD8þ T cells were
determined as described previously (15) using anti-PD-1
(Becton Dickinson). Cells were analyzed using the Coulter
FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
Immunohistochemistry staining
Paraffin-embedded chloroma tissues were stained as previously described (17). Briefly, antigen retrieval was done using
10 minutes of boiling in 0.01 mol/L of sodium citrate pH 6.0
followed by incubation with primary antibodies anti-PD-L1
(eBioscience), anti-PD-L2 (eBioscience), anti-CD8 (DAKO),
anti-CD34 (Klinipath), and anti-FoxP3 (ITK Diagnostics).
Staining was visualized either by 3,3-diaminobenzidine
(DAB) or aminoethyl carbazole (AEC) staining.
IFN-g and granzyme B ELISA
Production of IFN-g and granzyme B by stimulated T cells
was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA; IFN-g: Pierce Endogen; granzyme B: Mabtech) according to manufacturer's protocol.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and
microarray analysis
Total RNA was isolated from cell samples using Trizol
(Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were

carried out as described (18). The hydroxymethylbilane
synthase (HMBS) housekeeping gene was used to normalize
PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression. PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression is shown in DDCt values and was quantified relative to cell
line U266, which was set at 1 DDCt value. DDCt was calculated
as follows: 2^(-[DCtsample]  [DCtU266]), in which DCt was
normalized for HMBS by calculating DCt ¼ Ctgene  CtHMBS
per sample.
For microarray analysis, LRH-1-tetramerþ human CD8þ T
cells were sorted (median sorted cell number ¼ 1,300; range
200–15,000 cells) on an Epics Elite sorter (Beckman Coulter),
resulting in a more than 96% pure product, and resuspended
in Trizol. RNA extraction, amplification, cDNA generation, and
microarray analysis were done as described previously (19).
Statistical analysis
Paired 1-tailed student t test or 1-way ANOVA followed by a
Bonferroni post hoc test was used when appropriate.

Results
Myeloid leukemia progenitor cells differentially express
PD-L1 compared with CD80 and CD86
To investigate whether myeloid leukemia cells in relapsed
patients after alloSCT express PD-L1 under inflammatory
conditions, we analyzed leukemia samples from 2 patients
who relapsed despite circulating LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells
(Table 1). We found that CD34þ CML-AP cells from a relapsed
patient (Pt 1) at 4 years after DLI express PD-L1 upon

stimulation with IFN-g (Fig. 1A), whereas expression of costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on these CD34þ CML-AP
cells was low. Furthermore, we observed high PD-L1 expression on CD34þ leukemia cells in a chloroma biopsy of an AML
patient (Pt 2) who relapsed 3 years after DLI (Fig. 1B). Again,
we found that these extramedullary AML cells expressed low
levels of CD80 and CD86 (data not shown). Staining of specific
T-cell markers revealed that CD8þ T cells extensively infiltrated the chloroma, whereas FoxP3þ regulatory T cells were
hardly detectable (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest
that selective expression of PD-L1 on these relapsed leukemia
cells could have been involved in evading LRH-1–specific
CD8þ T-cell immunity.
To determine whether selective induction of PD-L1 expression under inflammatory conditions is a general phenomenon
in leukemia, we analyzed a panel of 12 primary AML samples
for expression of co-signaling ligands following treatment with
IFN-g and TNF-a (Table 1). Indeed, these cytokines induced a
137-fold and 31-fold upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA,
respectively (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, consistent with the findings in the 2 relapsed leukemia patients, PD-L1 cell surface
expression was significantly upregulated (>20% PD-L1þ cells)
on AML cells of 7 out of 10 newly diagnosed patients, whereas
expression of PD-L2 was only slightly induced (Fig. 1D).
Notably, PD-L1–expressing AML cells displayed very low
expression of CD80 and a variable expression of CD86, which
was not influenced by IFN-g/TNF-a treatment.
Because AML clones comprise heterogeneous populations
of malignant cells, we studied whether different AML populations exhibited differential expression of co-signaling molecules. By using multicolor flowcytometry (FCM), we defined 3
distinct AML populations defined as CD33þCD117þCD14 AML progenitor cells, CD33þCD117CD14 AML

myelo/monoblasts, and CD33þCD117CD14þ AML promonocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). A panel of 9 AML
patients with different French American British (FAB) classifications was used for analyzing expression of co-signaling
ligands upon IFN-g  TNF-a stimulation. Interestingly, the
most immature CD33þCD117þCD14 AML cells exhibited
high PD-L1 expression (range: 46%–94% PD-L1þ cells) in
combination with almost absent or very low expression of
PD-L2, CD80, and CD86 under inflammatory conditions
(Fig. 1E). The CD33þCD117CD14 AML myelo/monoblasts
showed slightly more upregulation of PD-L1 and CD80 expression and higher CD86 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Mature CD33þCD117CD14þ AML promonocytes display
combined upregulation of PD-L1, PD-L2, CD80, and CD86
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Collectively, these data show that immature AML cells
which contain the putative leukemic stem cells selectively
upregulate PD-L1 expression following short-term exposure to
IFN-g and TNF-a, enabling these leukemia progenitor cells to
inhibit T-cell–mediated attack via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.
Effect of PD-L1–expressing AML cells on allogeneic
T cells
To investigate whether PD-L1 expression on AML cells can
dampen allogeneic T-cell responses, we performed mixed
lymphocyte reactions between PD-L1–expressing AML cells
and allogeneic CD3þ T cells in the absence or presence of antiPD-1/BMS-936558 and anti-PD-L1/BMS-936559 blocking antibodies. Blocking with either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody
significantly increased the proliferation of CD3þ T cells
upon stimulation with allogeneic PD-L1þ AML cells from
AML-M4 Pt 9 (Fig. 2A), whereas allogeneic T-cell proliferation
stimulated with PD-L1þ and PD-L2þ mDCs could only be

PD-1 Signaling Impairs MiHA-Specific CD8þ T Cells

inhibited with anti-PD-1 (Fig. 2B). This difference can be
explained by the high PD-L2 expression on mDC resulting
in insufficient interference of PD-1 signaling by the PD-L1
antibody. In agreement with the T-cell proliferation data, IFNg production was also increased by blocking of PD-1 interactions between T cells and PD-L1þ AML cells (Fig. 2C) or PDL1þ/L2þ mDC (Fig. 2D). These results show that PD-L1
expression on AML cells decreases T-cell proliferation and
cytokine production.
MiHA-specific CTL expansion and function is enhanced
by PD-1 blockade
To elucidate the role of PD-L1 on AML cells in inhibiting the
recognition by MiHA-specific CD8þ T cells, we performed
antigen restimulation experiments using CTL clone RP1 that
recognizes the hematopoietic-restricted MiHA LRH-1 on AML
progenitor cells (4). RP1, as well as CTLs against other MiHA,
upregulates the expression of PD-1 upon coculture with
MiHAþ AML (Supplementary Fig. S3 and data not shown).
Antibody blockade of PD-1 signaling using human antibodies
resulted in improved proliferation and IFN-g production by
CTL RP1 upon engagement of PD-L1–expressing primary
AML cells from Pt 11 loaded with MiHA peptide (Fig. 2E
and G). As hypothesized, we found that PD-1 blockade
strongly elevated the proliferation and IFN-g production by
CTL RP1 when stimulated with peptide-loaded PD-L1þ iDC
(Fig. 2F and H). Cytotoxicity of CTL versus AML was also
enhanced after PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade (Fig. 2I), whereas no
cytoxicity was observed versus iDC (Fig. 2J). These data
indicate that MiHA-specific CD8þ effector T cells can be
inhibited via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway either by AML or
resident APC populations that selectively express PD-L1 in
the leukemia microenvironment.
PD-1 is highly expressed by circulating MiHA-specific
CD8þ T cells in vivo
Next, we investigated whether PD-1 is expressed by LRH-1–
specific T cells in CML-AP Pt 1 and AML-M0 Pt 2 who relapsed
3 and 4 years, respectively, after the initial DLIs that induced
long-lasting LRH-1–specific CD8þ T-cell responses in these
patients. PD-1 expression could be detected on LRH-1–specific
CD8þ T cells during the complete course of the immune
response after DLI which peaked at week 28 for CML-AP Pt
1 and at week 10 for AML-M0 Pt 2 (Fig. 3A). We observed
relatively elevated expression of PD-1 on LRH-1 tetramerpositive T cells compared with tetramer-negative CD8þ T cells
in the same patient (Fig. 3A and B). After DLI, PD-1 levels at the
cell surface of LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells gradually declined,
but more than 95% of the tetramer-positive T cells remained
PD-1 positive during the contraction phase. To determine PD-1
expression of the apparently impaired LRH-1–specific CD8þ
Tmem cells in the relapsed patients several years after DLI, we
sorted LRH-1–specific CD8þ Teff cells (Pt 1: 1.8% at week 28; Pt 2
2.9% at week 15) and low frequencies of LRH-1–specific CD8þ
Tmem cells (Pt 1: 0.08% at week 225; Pt 2 0.05% at week 151) and
performed microarray analysis using amplified cDNA. PD-1
mRNA levels of LRH-1–specific CD8þ Tmem cells at the time of
relapse were elevated or similar compared with LRH-1–specific

www.aacrjournals.org

CD8þ Teff cells at the peak of the response for Pt 1 and Pt 2,
respectively (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that LRH-1–specific
CD8þ T cells express elevated levels of PD-1 on the cell surface,
which remain present during the contraction and late memory
phase of the immune response following DLI.
PD-1 blockade augments proliferation of MiHA-specific
CD8þ T cells
To further elucidate the role of PD-1 in impairment of LRH1–specific CD8þ Tmem cells, we performed functional assays
using PBMCs from CML-AP Pt 1 containing 0.05% to 0.10%
LRH-1–specific CD8þ Tmem cells several years after the initial
response. Stimulation of PBMC of Pt 1 with peptide alone in
the presence of IL-2 and IL-15 did not result in an increase of
LRH-1–specific T cells (data not shown). Notably, PD-1 or PDL1 blockade resulted in a 2- to 4-fold increase in the number of
LRH-1–specific T cells (Fig. 4A). However, peptide stimulation
in the presence of PD-1 blockade, but in the absence of
professional APCs, resulted in insufficient T-cell outgrowth.
Therefore, we stimulated PBMCs containing LRH-1–specific
Tmem cells with peptide-loaded PD-L1–expressing iDC in the
presence of PD-1 blockade. Blockade with anti-PD-1 antibody
resulted in a 20 times higher number of LRH-1–specific CD8þ
T cells after 3 stimulations with peptide-loaded PD-L1þ iDCs
(Fig. 4B). Consistently, we observed a specific increase to 4.4%
LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells compared with 0.6% with the
isotype control after repeated DC stimulations using blockade
with anti-PD-1 (Fig. 4C).
Similar assays were performed with PBMC obtained 7 and
36 months post-DLI containing low numbers of LRH-1–specific Tmem cells from AML-M0 Pt 2. In these assays, we used
mDC to prevent repetitive T-cell stimulation. At 7 months
post-DLI, blocking with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibody
resulted in increased outgrowth of LRH-1–specific CD8þ T
cells up to 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively, compared with 2.0% in
the presence of an isotype control (Fig. 4D). In addition, during
relapse at 36 months post-DLI, upon PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade
LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells increased to 1.16% and 0.86%,
respectively, compared with 0.59% for isotype control
(Table 2). To confirm effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on the
proliferative capacity of other MiHA-specific T cells, we stimulated PBMC from a relapsed multiple myeloma (MM)
patient (Pt 16) containing HA-1–specific T cells. In concordance with results obtained with LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells,
blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions leads to enhanced mDCstimulated proliferation of HA-1–specific CD8þ T cells
(Fig. 4E). In addition, we investigated whether PD-1 blockade
increased the absolute amount of MiHA-specific T cells. For
AML Pt 2 and MM Pt 16, we observed a robust absolute
increase of MiHA-specific T cells upon PD-1 and PD-L1
blockade (Fig. 5A).
Next, we investigated whether the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 is
exclusive for dysfunctional MiHA-specific T cells in relapsed
patients, or that it also affects potential nonimpaired T cells in
patients with remission after alloSCT. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking in CML-BC Pt 15 and
pre-T ALL Pt 17 (Table 2). PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade does
enhance the absolute number of MiHA-specific T cells, but the

Figure 3. MiHA-specific T cells express elevated levels of PD-1 in vivo. A, PD-1 expression of LRH-1–specific T cells in CML-AP Pt 1 and AML-M0 Pt 2

effect is moderate (Fig. 5B). Finally, we compared the effect of
PD-1 blockade on MiHA-specific T cells from relapsed patients
to those from patients in remission. Importantly, we showed
that PD-1 blockade has a significantly superior effect on
dysfunctional MiHA-specific T cells from relapsed patients
(Fig. 5C).
Collectively, these results show that PD-1 signaling impairs
the proliferative capacity of MiHA-specific CD8þ T cells upon
antigen stimulation prior to or during relapse, and this functional impairment can be abrogated by PD-1/PD-L1 immune
checkpoint blockade.

Discussion
AlloSCT is a potentially curative treatment for advanced
myeloid leukemia (1). The effect largely depends on alloreac-

5118

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

tive CD8þ T cells targeting MiHA on leukemic blasts and
progenitor cells (20). However, MiHA-specific CD8þ T-cell
responses induced after transplantation are in many patients
not sufficient to sustain complete remission. Distinct mechanisms are involved in reducing antitumor T-cell responses,
allowing malignant cells to escape immune destruction.
Among these mechanisms, T-cell inhibition or even exhaustion due to signaling of the PD-1/PD-L pathway may diminish
immune responses by limiting the expansion and functionality
of CD8þ T cells (12, 21). Recently, we showed that LRH-1þ
leukemia can relapse without inducing secondary LRH-1–
specific CD8þ Tmem cell expansion, suggesting that these
Tmem cells are either suppressed or not activated (3, 4). In
this study, we examined the role of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions in
functional impairment of LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells reactive to myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, we showed that PD-L1

and to some extent, PD-L2 was expressed by CD34þ progenitor myeloid leukemia cells of 2 patients with relapses after
initial efficient T-cell responses. Furthermore, we confirmed
expression of PD-L1 on a broader panel of AML samples at
diagnosis. Previously, it has been shown that PD-L1 expression
is elevated on relapse AML compared with diagnosis material
(22). We investigated this in 1 CML patient, and indeed, PD-L1
expression was higher on relapse tumor cells than cells at
diagnosis (Table 1). Especially, CD117þCD14 early progenitor myeloid leukemia cells, which contain the leukemic stem
cells, highly expressed PD-L1. PD-L1 expression increased
upon exposure to inflammatory cytokines, whereas expression
of CD80 and CD86 remained low. Consequently, prolonged
PD-1/PD-L1 interactions may lead to functional exhaustion of

LRH-1–specific Tmem cells, and relapse of the leukemia may
occur without induction of a secondary immune response.
To investigate whether LRH-1–specific T cells display an
impaired phenotype, we analyzed T cells of 2 patients with
LRH-1–specific responses. It is known that PD-1 is elevated on
T cells specific for viral epitopes in chronic viral infections
(23). Also, during CML disease, PD-1 levels of the total
population of CD8þ T cells are elevated (12). Here, we showed
for the first time that MiHA-specific Tmem cells can have an
elevated level of PD-1. Both patients with the nonresponding
Tmem cells had leukemia relapses following a robust initial
LRH-1–specific T-cell response. Whether or not elevated PD-1

PD-1 Signaling Impairs MiHA-Specific CD8þ T Cells

be determined in a larger cohort of patients. However, we
found that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway negatively influences the
function of PD-1-expressing LRH-1–specific CTL. Most importantly, we show that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions with
human blocking antibodies resulted in increased outgrowth of
MiHA-specific Tmem cells. We also observed a stimulatory
effect of PD-1 blockade on MiHA-specific T cells from patients
in remission, which is not unexpected due to the role of PD-1
in regulation of T-cell activation. However, the abrogation of
PD-1 signaling had a significant stronger effect on the proliferation of MiHA-specific T cells in relapsed patients than
those in patients in remission.
Besides PD-1, several other inhibitory receptors play a role
in functional T-cell exhaustion, such as CTLA-4, LAG-3, BTLA,
TIM-3, CD160, and CD244 (24). In future years, the influence of
this array of coinhibitory receptors will be further elucidated.
Perhaps, combinations of blocking antibodies to PD-1 and
LAG-3 will result in highly reactivated MiHA-specific T-cell
responses (25). But, as PD-1 is involved in peripheral tolerance,
autoimmune events following PD-1 blockade therapy may
occur (26). In a recent phase I study, the clinical grade
anti-PD-1 antibody BMS-936558, also used in our study,
was administered to patients with solid tumors. Anti-PD-1
was well tolerated and only 1 serious adverse event, inflammatory colitis, was observed in a melanoma patient. Remarkably, 1 durable complete response and 2 partial responses
were observed (16).
Our current in vitro data illustrate that PD-1 blockade is an
attractive approach to reinvigorate impaired MiHA-specific T
cells in patients with persisting or relapsed leukemia. However, in the setting of alloSCT, PD-1 blockade could aggravate
GVHD. For optimal boosting selective GVT immunity in the
post-SCT setting, we would like to combine active immunotherapy by DC vaccination using hematopoietic-restricted
MiHAs with PD-1 blockade. By inducing a time-limited alleviation of PD-1 signaling combined with an antigen-specific
stimulus, we aim to resuscitate the impaired MiHA-specific T
cells, without causing autoimmune effects or GVHD. Another
strategy is to specifically knock down PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 on
MiHA-loaded DC vaccines by siRNA. In a recent article, we
showed that stimulation with PD-L1/2 knockdown DCs
resulted in specific outgrowth of initially unresponsive
MiHA-specific T cells (15). This strategy would minimize

off-target stimulatory effects, because the hyperstimulatory
DCs are loaded with hematopoietic-restricted MiHA. Results
of clinical trials being performed with BMS-936558 and BMS936559 in parallel with preclinical mouse models using blocking antibodies in a post-SCT setting will determine the ideal
therapy combination.
In conclusion, we showed PD-L expression on myeloid
leukemia cells, especially under inflammatory conditions.
Interestingly, CD117þ early progenitor myeloid leukemia
cells express high levels of PD-L1, but low CD80 and
CD86 expression. Furthermore, we showed that blockade
by human anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 increases proliferation
and IFN-g and granzyme B production by LRH-1–specific
CTL incubated with PD-L1þ leukemia cells. In addition,
LRH-1–specific CD8þ T cells exhibit elevated PD-1 expression in vivo. Most importantly, we could specifically resuscitate initially unresponsive MiHA-specific Tmem cells by PD1/PD-L1 blockade. Therefore, we postulate that PD-1 blockade could be a powerful addition to post-SCT therapy.
Combining MiHA-specific DC vaccination with PD-1 blockade may reinvigorate impaired MiHA-specific Tmem cells and
restore immune control, thereby preventing or attacking
leukemia relapses.
