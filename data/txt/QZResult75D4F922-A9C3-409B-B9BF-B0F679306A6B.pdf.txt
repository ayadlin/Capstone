Abstract
Proteasome inhibitors sensitize tumor cells to DNA-damaging
agents, including ionizing radiation (IR), and DNA crosslinking agents (melphalan and cisplatin) through unknown
mechanisms. The Fanconi anemia pathway is a DNA damage–
activated signaling pathway, which regulates cellular resistance to DNA cross-linking agents. Monoubiquitination and
nuclear foci formation of FANCD2 are critical steps of the
Fanconi anemia pathway. Here, we show that proteasome
function is required for the activation of the Fanconi anemia
pathway and for DNA damage signaling. Proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and MG132) and depletion of 19S and 20S
proteasome subunits (PSMD4, PSMD14, and PSMB3) inhibited
monoubiquitination and/or nuclear foci formation of
FANCD2, whereas depletion of DSS1/SHFM1, a subunit of the
19S proteasome that also directly binds to BRCA2, did not
inhibit FANCD2 monoubiquitination or foci formation. On the
other hand, DNA damage–signaling processes, such as IRinduced foci formation of phosphorylated ATM (phosphoATM), 53BP1, NBS1, BRCA1, FANCD2, and RAD51, were
delayed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, whereas
ATM autophosphorylation and nuclear foci formation of
;H2AX, MDC1, and RPA were not inhibited. Furthermore,
persistence of DNA damage and abrogation of the IR-induced
G1-S checkpoint resulted from proteasome inhibition. In
summary, we showed that the proteasome function is required
for monoubiquitination of FANCD2, foci formation of 53BP1,
phospho-ATM, NBS1, BRCA1, FANCD2, and RAD51. The
dependence of specific DNA damage–signaling steps on the
proteasome may explain the sensitization of tumor cells to
DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents by proteasome
inhibitors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7395–405]

Introduction
The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for the vast
majority of protein degradation in eukaryotes (1). The 26S
proteasome (constituted of the catalytic 20S proteasome and the
regulatory 19S proteasome) controls the destruction of damaged
and abnormally folded proteins as well as protein turnover, hence
tightly regulating multiple cellular processes. Ubiquitin is a
reversible and versatile regulatory signal, which controls degradation of proteins through Lys48 polyubiquitination but also modifies
the subcellular localization and catalytic activity of proteins

through monoubiquitination and Lys63 polyubiquitination (2).
Ubiquitin dynamic is ensured by activating (E1) and conjugating
(E2) enzymes and ubiquitin ligases (E3) required for its covalent
binding to the target proteins and by deubiquitinating enzymes
catalyzing its removal and recycling.
Proteasome inhibitors are natural [h-lactones (lactacystin),
epipolythioldioxopiperazine, etc.] and synthetic products {peptide
aldehyde [MG132, MG115, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN), and
PSI], peptide boronates (bortezomib), etc.}, which mostly inhibit
the chymotryptic-like activity of the 20S proteasome (h5 subunit),
although h1 and h2 subunits may also be inhibited in vivo by
bortezomib (3). Proteasome inhibitors show antitumor activities
through proapoptotic and antiproliferative mechanisms (4). Bortezomib has recently been approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and is currently being tested for
treatment of other malignancies (5).
Proteasome inhibitors also sensitize tumor cells to widely used
cancer therapeutics, including ionizing radiation (IR; ref. 6), and
DNA cross-linking agents (melphalan and cisplatin; refs. 7, 8). They
sensitize myeloma cells to melphalan and doxorubicin (7) and
ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin (8). Clinical trials show promising
results for combination of bortezomib with melphalan and other
drugs in myeloma treatment (9) and with carboplatin (a cisplatin
derivative) in ovarian cancer treatment (10). However, the molecular bases of the sensitization to DNA-damaging agents by proteasome inhibitors remain unclear.
The Fanconi anemia pathway (Supplementary Fig. S1A) is a DNA
damage–activated signaling pathway critical for cellular resistance
to DNA interstrand cross-links (reviewed in ref. 11). Inherited
biallelic mutations in 1 of the 13 known Fanconi anemia genes
cause Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic cancer-prone disorder
characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking
agents. Eight Fanconi anemia proteins assemble in the Fanconi
anemia core complex, which is required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination during normal S phase, and, together with ATR and RPA, in
response to exogenous DNA damage (12–14). Fanconi anemia core
complex is considered to be the ubiquitin ligase (E3), and UBE2T
the E2, for FANCD2 monoubiquitination (15, 16). Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 is targeted, in a BRCA1-dependent manner, to
nuclear foci where it colocalizes with DNA damage signaling and
repair proteins, including BRCA1, RAD51, and BRCA2/FANCD1
(12). FANCD2 monoubiquitination and nuclear foci formation are
critical for the function of the Fanconi anemia pathway, and lack
of these steps causes cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking
agents (12). A deubiquitinating enzyme, USP1, deubiquitinates monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and negatively regulates the Fanconi anemia
pathway (17). Importantly, the integrity of the Fanconi anemia
pathway is required for tumor resistance to cisplatin (reviewed
in ref. 11). Consequently, drugs inhibiting the Fanconi anemia pathway may sensitize tumor cells to DNA cross-linking agents.
In response to DNA lesions, cells initiate cascades of phosphorylation/recruitment events, mostly mediated by the ATM and ATR

kinases. Activation of the Fanconi anemia pathway is one of those
numerous cellular responses to DNA damage.
The proteasome has been implicated in DNA repair in yeast.
Sem1/DSS1/SHFM1 protein is a newly identified subunit of the 19S
proteasome in both yeast and human cells (18). In yeast, Sem1 is
recruited with the 19S and 20S proteasomes to DNA double-strand
breaks (DSB) in vivo and is required for efficient repair of DSB by
homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining
pathways (18). Human DSS1/SHFM1 physically binds to BRCA2/
FANCD1 and is required for its stability and function (19–21) and,
consequently, for efficient formation of RAD51 nucleofilaments
required for HR. However, the involvement of the proteasome in
DNA repair in mammalian cells has not been shown yet.
We hypothesized that inhibition of the DNA damage response in
general, and in particular inhibition of the Fanconi anemia pathway, may be involved in the chemosensitization to DNA-damaging
agents by proteasome inhibitors. We found that proteasome
inhibitors inhibit both monoubiquitination and nuclear foci
formation of FANCD2 as well as DNA damage–signaling processes,
such as foci formation of phosphorylated ATM (phospho-ATM),
53BP1, NBS1, BRCA1, and RAD51. The inhibition of both the Fanconi
anemia pathway and DNA damage response may explain the
sensitization of tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents induced by
proteasome inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. HeLa, IMR90, and TOV21G (FANCFinactivated ovarian cancer cells) were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collections. FANCF-corrected TOV21G cells (TOV21G+FANCF)
were described previously (22). GFPu-1 cells (23) were a gift of Dr. Muneesh
Tewari (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Cell lines
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. g-Irradiation was
delivered using a linear accelerator. For UV-C (254 nm) irradiation, cells
were washed in PBS and irradiated in the absence of liquid using a 2400 UV
Stratalinker (Stratagene). For cisplatin, hydroxyurea (Sigma), MG132, ALLN
(Calbiochem), lactacystin (Biomol International), and bortezomib (Millennium Pharmaceuticals) treatments, cells were continuously exposed to the
drug for the indicated time. Cells used for Western blotting, RNA extraction,
immunofluorescence, and cell cycle analyses were generally issued from one
single culture dish.
Small interfering RNA transfection. Expression of targeted genes was
knocked down by transient transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA)
directed against DSS1 (5¶-AAGGTAGACTTAGGTCTGTTA-3¶), PSMB3
(Hs_PSMB3_6_HP Validated siRNA, Qiagen), PSMD4 (5¶-AAGGAGGAAGACAAGAAGTGA-3¶), PSMD14 (5¶-TAGGACATGAACCAAGACAAA-3¶), UCH37
(5¶-ACCGAGCTCATTAAAGGATTC-3¶), USP1 (5¶-TCGGCAATACTTGCTATCTTA-3¶; ref. 17), and USP14 (5¶-AGCATCGTAACACCAGAAGAT-3¶;
Qiagen). Negative controls were obtained by transfection of nontargeting
siRNA (5¶-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3¶). Cells (2  105) were transfected with siRNA oligos ( final concentration, 50 nmol/L) using HiPerFect
reagent (Qiagen). Cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection of siRNA
targeting proteasome subunits and 72 to 96 h after transfection of USP1
siRNA. Efficiency of siRNA treatment was evaluated by semiquantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and/or Western blotting. Total RNAs
were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 Ag RNA was used for
reverse transcription reaction using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and
oligo(dT) primers. PCR was done using following PCR primers: DSS1-L,
TTCCCCAAGTCTCTATGGTAGC; DSS1-R, TAGTGTCCCATCCTGGGTTC;

Images of agarose gels were acquired using ChemiDoc XRS apparatus
and QuantiOne software (Bio-Rad). ImageJ software was used for
densitometry quantification.
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell extracts were obtained by direct lysis
of cells in lysis buffer [0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 6% hmercaptoethanol] boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was done
using NuPAGE 3% to 8% Tris-acetate or NuPAGE 4% to 12% Tris-glycine
gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes using a submerged transfer apparatus. Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against FANCD2 (FI-17, 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), gH2AX (#05-636, 1:1,000; Upstate), proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA; PC10, 1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PSMB3 (PW8130,
1:1,000; Biomol International), PSMD4 (PW9250, 1:1,000; Biomol International), USP14 (H00009097-M04, 1:2,000; Novus Biologicals), and rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against USP1 [C-term, 1:3,000; gift of Drs. Tony Huang
(New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY) and Alan D’Andrea
(Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA); ref. 24] were used as primary
antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated enhanced chemiluminescence anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000; Amersham) were used as
secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was used for detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Films were digitalized using a standard scanner and
images were processed using Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems, Inc.). ImageJ
software was used for densitometry quantification.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were grown on coverslips in
tissue culture plates and treated as indicated with DNA-damaging agents
and proteasome inhibitors. Coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min,
and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS + 5% bovine serum albumin + 0.1%
Tween 20) for 30 min. Specific primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4jC. Mouse
monoclonal antibodies detecting ATM-Ser1981P (#200-301-400, 1:1,000;
Rockland), BRCA1 (D-9, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), gH2AX (JBW301,
1:1,000; Upstate), and RPA2 (NA18, 1:300; Calbiochem) and rabbit polyclonal
antibodies detecting FANCD2 (NB 100-182, 1:1,000; Novus Biologicals),
MDC1 (1:1,000; gift of Dr. Junjie Chen, Yale University, New Haven, CT), NBS1
(NB 100-143, 1:200; Novus Biologicals), RAD51 (PC130, 1:1,000; Calbiochem),
and 53BP1 (PC712, 1:500; Calbiochem) were used as primary antibodies.
Species-specific fluorescein- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in blocking buffer (1:1,000) were incubated for
1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (1 Ag/mL). Coverslips were mounted on slides in Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories). Two-dimensional acquisitions were made with a
microscope (TE2000, Nikon) equipped with a 40 immersion objective
(1.3 numerical aperture) and a CCD camera (CoolSNAP ES, Photometrics).
Images were acquired and analyzed using MetaVue (Universal Imaging).
At least 100 cells per experimental point were scored for presence of foci, and
each experiment was repeated at least thrice independently.
Flow cytometry analyses. Exponentially growing cells were plated in drugfree medium 24 h before experiment and then exposed to DNA-damaging
agents and proteasome inhibitors as described. For cell cycle analyses, cells
were pulse labeled with 30 Amol/L 5-bromo-2¶-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma)
for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol.
Cells were then stained for DNA content (propidium iodide) and BrdUrd
incorporation with anti-BrdUrd rat monoclonal antibody (MAS250, Harlan
Sera-Lab) followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch). For analyses of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression
in GFPu-1 cells, control and proteasome inhibitor–treated and siRNA-treated
live cells resuspended in ice-cold PBS were analyzed. 1  105 cells were
analyzed for each experimental point. Fluorescence data were plotted using
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.). Three
independent experiments were carried out for each condition.

Proteasome and DNA Damage Response

effect of proteasome inhibitors on FANCD2 monoubiquitination
and nuclear foci formation (Fig. 1). FANCD2 monoubiquitination
was significantly increased by cellular exposure to cisplatin (Fig. 1A,
compare lane 6 with lane 1). An additional 8-h incubation with
proteasome inhibitors (MG132, bortezomib, lactacystin, and ALLN)
induced a decrease of both basal and cisplatin-induced FANCD2
monoubiquitination (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–5 and 7–10). FANCD2
monoubiquitination is required for its targeting into nuclear foci
at sites of DNA damage (12). Consistently, proteasome inhibitors
inhibited cisplatin-induced nuclear foci formation of FANCD2
(Fig. 1A, bottom), whereas gH2AX foci formation was not inhibited.
Similar results were observed in IMR90 human primary fibroblasts
and a FANCF-corrected TOV21G ovarian cancer cell line
(TOV21G+FANCF; data not shown). Bortezomib (or MG132; data
not shown) inhibited monoubiquitination of FANCD2 induced by
various DNA-damaging agents (IR, cisplatin, hydroxyurea, and UV
irradiation) in HeLa (Fig. 1B), IMR90, and TOV21G+FANCF cells
(data not shown). IR-induced monoubiquitination and foci
formation of FANCD2 were dramatically inhibited by proteasome
inhibitors for up to 12 h in HeLa and IMR90 (Fig. 1C) as well as in
TOV21G+FANCF cells (data not shown).
Changes in the proportion of S-phase cells may affect FANCD2
monoubiquitination and foci formation (13). Hydroxyurea treatment, which blocks cells in early S phase, induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 (Fig. 1D). Treatment with proteasome inhibitors
for up to 8 h did not significantly alter the cell cycle distribution
and proportion of cells in S phase (nor increased apoptosis; data
not shown) in both asynchronous and hydroxyurea-treated HeLa
cells (Fig. 1D, bottom), whereas basal and hydroxyurea-induced
FANCD2 monoubiquitination were inhibited (Fig. 1D, top).
In summary, proteasome inhibitors strongly inhibited both basal
and DNA damage–induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination and foci
formation in various cell types through a mechanism independent
of cell cycle deregulation.
Proteasome is required for the activation of the Fanconi
anemia pathway. To confirm the role of proteasome in Fanconi
anemia pathway activation, we knocked down the expression of
several proteasome subunits (Fig. 2A): PSMB3 (h3), a structural
subunit of the 20S proteasome; PSMD4 (Rpn10), the polyubiquitin
receptor of the 19S proteasome; DSS1/SHFM1, part of the 19S
proteasome, which also directly binds to BRCA2/FANCD1; PSMD14
(Rpn11) and UCH37, both deubiquitinating enzymes part of the 19S
proteasome; and USP14, another deubiquitinating enzyme associated with the 19S proteasome.
Efficiency of the depletions is presented in Fig. 2A and their effect
on proteasome catalytic function (measured using GFPu-1 cells
expressing GFP coupled to a short degron, which allows to monitor
proteasome activity through GFP expression; ref. 23) in Fig. 2B.
Depletion of PSMD14 severely decreased proteasome proteolytic
activity and led to a significant inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 16–18 with lanes 13–15) and foci
formation (Fig. 2D) in HeLa cells. PSMB3 and PSMD4 depletion
slightly decreased proteasome activity and inhibited FANCD2 foci
formation (Fig. 2D), whereas inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination was minimal (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–9). DSS1, USP14, and UCH37
depletion minimally affected proteasome activity (Fig. 2B). DSS1
and UCH37 knockdown did not inhibit FANCD2 monoubiquitination or foci formation (Fig. 2C, lanes 10–12 and 22–24, and D).
Surprisingly, depletion of USP14 significantly inhibited FANCD2 foci
formation (Fig. 2D) but did not inhibit FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Fig. 2C, lanes 19–21). These results confirm the requirement of

www.aacrjournals.org

proteasome proteolytic function for the activation of the Fanconi
anemia pathway and show that inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination requires a more profound proteasome inhibition than
inhibition of FANCD2 foci formation, suggesting that the proteasome affects these two events independently. These data also
suggest a specific role for USP14 in FANCD2 foci formation.
Specific inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination by
proteasome inhibition. To test whether proteasome inhibition
affects monoubiquitination processes in general, we compared the
effect of proteasome inhibitors on FANCD2 and PCNA monoubiquitination. Both FANCD2 and PCNA are nuclear proteins
monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage and colocalize at
sites of DNA damage on chromatin. They also share the same
deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 (17, 24, 25), which is the only known
deubiquitinating enzyme for FANCD2 and PCNA.
FANCD2, but not PCNA, monoubiquitination was inhibited
by MG132 in cells treated with cisplatin, IR, hydroxyurea, and
UV (Fig. 3A). Treatment of mock- and hydroxyurea-treated HeLa
cells with increasing concentrations of MG132 revealed a dosedependent inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and a
reciprocal up-regulation of PCNA monoubiquitination (Fig. 3B).
These results show that proteasome inhibitor–induced inhibition
of monoubiquitination is specific to FANCD2. Proteasome inhibition can lead to the depletion of cellular free ubiquitin (26),
but the increase of hydroxyurea-induced PCNA monoubiquitination in the presence of increasing doses of proteasome inhibitor
(Fig. 3B, lanes 11 and 12) suggests that cellular free ubiquitin is still
available to modify nuclear proteins.
Expression of USP1 protein, the unique known deubiquitinating
enzyme for FANCD2 and PCNA, was not increased, but rather
decreased, in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3C),
indicating that FANCD2 deubiquitination is not due to USP1
stabilization induced by proteasome inhibition. Even after USP1
knockdown, which efficiency was shown by the increased
spontaneous FANCD2 and PCNA monoubiquitination (Fig. 3D,
lane 7 compared with lane 1), the addition of MG132 led to a rapid
decrease of both spontaneous and hydroxyurea-induced FANCD2
monoubiquitination (Fig. 3D, lanes 7–12), suggesting the involvement of other deubiquitinating enzyme(s). Among the three
deubiquitinating enzymes associated with the proteasome
(PSMD14, USP14, and UCH37), USP14 is activated on treatment
with proteasome inhibitor in vivo (27) and has been reported to
interact with FANCC (28), therefore seemed as a good candidate
for proteasome inhibitor–activated deubiquitinating enzyme for
FANCD2. However, depletion of these deubiquitinating enzymes
(USP14, UCH37, and PSMD14) failed to reverse proteasome
inhibition–induced deubiquitination of FANCD2 (Fig. 2B, lanes
18, 21, and 24), indicating that they are not responsible for the
proteasome inhibitor–induced deubiquitination of FANCD2. The
responsible deubiquitinating enzyme remains unknown.
FANCD2 monoubiquitination is dependent on Fanconi anemia
core complex (E3), UBE2T (E2), and ATR (Supplementary Fig. S1A;
refs. 12, 14, 16). Treatment with MG132 did not decrease the
expression of the components of the Fanconi anemia core complex
(FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, and FANCM) or UBE2T
and did not affect coimmunoprecipitation of FANCC with FANCA,
revealing the formation of the Fanconi anemia core complex
(Supplementary Fig. S1B–D). In the conditions we used (2 Amol/L
MG132 for 12 h), no stabilization of FANCC was observed, although
it has been reported after longer exposure to higher dose of MG132
(29). ATR is required for monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in

subjected to IR (15 Gy) or UV irradiation (50 J/m2) and incubated with bortezomib (1 Amol/L) for 8 h immediately after cisplatin removal, during the last 8 h of
hydroxyurea treatment, or immediately after IR and UV irradiation, respectively. C, proteasome inhibitors inhibited IR-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination and foci
formation for up to 12 h after generation of DNA damage. HeLa cells and IMR90 primary human fibroblasts were pretreated with bortezomib (1 Amol/L) or MG132
(2 Amol/L) for 4 h, irradiated (15 Gy), and incubated in the presence of the corresponding proteasome inhibitor for the indicated duration. Whole-cell extracts from

cells were mock treated or incubated with hydroxyurea (1 mmol/L) for 24 h, and MG132 (2 Amol/L) was added at the indicated time before the end of hydroxyurea
treatment. Whole-cell extracts were subjected to FANCD2 immunoblotting. Cells were pulse labeled with BrdUrd (30 Amol/L) for 15 min at the end of the 24-h treatment
with hydroxyurea. Incorporation of BrdUrd (Y axis ) and DNA content (propidium iodide; X axis ) was quantified by flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometric
analyses and the mean value of the proportion of cells in S phase are shown for each condition.

response to exogenous DNA damage but not for basal FANCD2
monoubiquitination (14), whereas proteasome inhibitors inhibited
both basal and DNA damage–induced monoubiquitination of
FANCD2. ATR-dependent CHK1 phosphorylation on Ser345 induced

by cisplatin, hydroxyurea, and UV (30) was not inhibited by
proteasome inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S2A), whereas CHK1
phosphorylation after IR was inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
These results argue against a general role of ATR inhibition

Figure 2. Depletion of proteasome subunits inhibits the activation of the Fanconi anemia pathway. (Full-length blots/gels are presented in Supplementary
Fig. S3E and F ). A, efficiency of proteasome subunit depletion. Lanes 1 to 8, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression in PSMB3-, PSMD4-, DSS1-,
PSMD14-, USP14-, and UCH37-depleted cells 48 h after siRNA transfection (depletion efficiency was 75% for PSMB3, 65% for PSMD4, 44% for DSS1, 63% for
PSMD14, 45% for USP14, and 43% for UCH37); lanes 9 to 16, whole-cellular extracts were also subjected to PSMB3, PSMD4, and USP14 immunoblots
(depletion efficiency was 86% for PSMB3, 99% for PSMD4, and 79% for USP14). PSMD14 depletion led to a concomitant down-regulation of PSMD4 protein
expression probably due to the destabilization of the 19S proteasome induced by the lack of PSMD14 protein. B, depletion of PSMD14 strongly inhibited proteasome
function, whereas depletion of PSMB3 and PSMD4 had a mild effect and depletion of USP14, UCH37, and DSS1 had only a minor effect on proteasome function.
GFPu-1 cells expressing GFP fused to a short degron were used to assess proteasome proteolytic function. Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, as well
as 6 h after treatment with MG132 (2 Amol/L) and bortezomib (1 Amol/L), cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP expression.

was strongly inhibited by PSMD14 depletion, minimally affected by PSMB3, PSMD4, DSS1, USP14, and UCH37 depletion. Forty hours after siRNA transfection,
HeLa cells were irradiated and treated with/without MG132 for 8 h after IR. Whole-cell extracts were subjected to FANCD2 immunoblotting. D, depletion of PSMB3,

Figure 3. Proteasome inhibitors inhibit FANCD2 monoubiquitination but not
PCNA monoubiquitination. (Full-length blots are presented in Supplementary
Fig. S3G–J ). A, proteasome inhibitors inhibited DNA damage–induced FANCD2
monoubiquitination but did not inhibit PCNA monoubiquitination. HeLa cells were
mock treated or incubated with cisplatin (25 Amol/L) or hydroxyurea (1 mmol/L)
for 24 h or subjected to IR (15 Gy) or UV irradiation (50 J/m2) and incubated with
MG132 (2 Amol/L) for 8 h immediately after cisplatin removal, during the last
8 h of hydroxyurea treatment, or immediately after IR and UV irradiation,
respectively. Whole-cell extracts were subjected to FANCD2 and PCNA
immunoblotting. B, inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and reciprocal
up-regulation of PCNA monoubiquitination increased with the dose of
proteasome inhibitors. Increasing doses of MG132 (0–20 Amol/L) were
applied for 8 h to mock- and hydroxyurea-treated HeLa cells. Whole-cell extracts
were subjected to FANCD2 and PCNA immunoblotting. C, USP1 expression
decreased in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. HeLa cells were mock
treated or incubated with hydroxyurea (1 mmol/L) for 24 h, and MG132 was
added at the indicated time before the end of hydroxyurea treatment. Whole-cell
extracts were subjected to FANCD2, PCNA, and USP1 immunoblotting.
D, knockdown of USP1 expression did not impede the inhibition of FANCD2
monoubiquitination induced by proteasome inhibitors. Seventy-two hours after
indicated siRNA transfection, cells were exposed to hydroxyurea (1 mmol/L)
for 24 h, and MG132 was added at the indicated time before the end of
hydroxyurea treatment. Whole-cell extracts were subjected to FANCD2,
PCNA, and USP1 immunoblotting.

in the proteasome inhibition–induced inhibition of FANCD2
monoubiquitination, although it may be involved specifically after
IR treatment. Taken together, proteasome inhibition leads to the
specific inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination by mechanisms
other than USP1 activation, ATR inhibition, and decreased expression of the Fanconi anemia core complex (E3) and UBE2T (E2).
Proteasome inhibitors inhibit IR-induced DNA damage
response. Next, we systematically tested which steps of the IRinduced DNA damage response are inhibited by proteasome
inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors did not inhibit the detection and
early signaling of DNA damage, as IR-induced foci formation of
gH2AX, MDC1, and RPA was not inhibited in MG132- or bortezomibtreated HeLa and IMR90 primary fibroblasts (Fig. 4). In contrast,
bortezomib and MG132 delayed foci formation of phospho-ATM
(Ser1981), 53BP1, NBS1, and BRCA1 and strongly inhibited RAD51
(Fig. 4) and FANCD2 (Fig. 1C) foci formation up to 12 h after
exposure to IR. Knockdown of proteasome subunits (PSMB3,
PSMD4, and PSMD14) and USP14 led to an impaired IR-induced
foci formation of BRCA1, RAD51 (Fig. 5), and FANCD2 (Fig. 2D).
Consistently, cisplatin-induced foci formation of FANCD2 (Fig. 1A),
phospho-ATM, BRCA1, and RAD51, but not gH2AX and RPA, was
inhibited by proteasome inhibitors and by depletion of proteasome
subunits (data not shown).
DNA damage signaling is propagated by multiple phosphorylation events catalyzed by protein kinases, such as ATM, ATR, CHK2,
and CHK1. As IR-induced phospho-ATM foci formation was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, we evaluated the status of ATM
autophosphorylation (Ser1981) and IR-induced ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of NBS1 (Ser343), CHK2 (Thr68), and FANCD2
(Thr691; refs. 31–34) on proteasome inhibition (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). None of these phosphorylation events was affected by
proteasome inhibition, suggesting that ATM activation is not
inhibited by proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, IR-induced CHK1
phosphorylation was inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that IR-induced activation of ATR is inhibited by proteasome
inhibition. In addition, RPA phosphorylation induced by all the
DNA-damaging agents tested (IR, UV, cisplatin, and hydroxyurea)
seemed to be inhibited by proteasome inhibition (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Current data indicate that RPA phosphorylation, which
is dependent on ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs, down-regulates DNA
replication and participates in intra-S-phase checkpoint but does
not affect DNA repair (35).
DSS1 depletion inhibited RAD51 foci formation, as reported
previously (20, 21), but not FANCD2 or BRCA1 foci formation, and
minimally affected proteolytic function of the proteasome (Figs. 2B
and D and 5). These results suggest that, in human cells, DSS1 is
critical for RAD51 foci formation but plays only a minor role in the
proteolytic function of the proteasome. The discrepancy with the
requirement of Sem1/DSS1 in yeast for proteolytic function of
the proteasome (36) may be related to the existence of the BRCA2
protein in vertebrates to which DSS1 directly binds.
Our results suggest a particular role for the proteasome-linked
deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 in the activation of DNA damage
response independently of proteasome proteolytic function, as
its absence led to the inhibition of BRCA1, FANCD2, and RAD51
foci formation (Figs. 2D and 5) but minimally affected FANCD2
monoubiquitination and the proteolytic function of the proteasome (Fig. 2B). The role of USP14 in DNA damage–induced foci
formation is currently under investigation.
Taken together, our results show for the first time that
proteasome function is required for efficient signaling of DNA

observed in MG132-untreated IMR90 primary fibroblasts, indicating that the IR-induced G1-S checkpoint was activated (37). In
contrast, in MG132-treated cells, the proportion of S-phase cells did
not decrease after IR, indicating a failure of activation of the G1-S
checkpoint (Fig. 6B) despite the accumulation of p53 and p21,
regulators of the G1-S checkpoint, on proteasome inhibition (data
not shown). The level of nucleotide incorporation decreased 8 and
12 h after IR exposure in MG132-treated cells (Fig. 6B) possibly due
to a slower progression of replication due to unrepaired DNA
lesions. These results indicate that inhibition of proteasome
function alters cell cycle control in the presence of IR-induced
DNA damage.

FANCD2, and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage.
Inhibition of DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint activation by proteasome inhibition. Proteasome inhibitors did not
inhibit histone H2AX phosphorylation and gH2AX foci formation
after DNA damage (Figs. 1A and C and 4B). Instead, we observed
that the level of DNA damage–induced H2AX phosphorylation
and the number of gH2AX foci per cell remained significantly
higher over time in proteasome inhibitor–treated cells compared
with mock-treated cells (Figs. 1C, 4B, and 6A), suggesting that
DNA repair is impaired in proteasome inhibitor–treated cells,
consistently with the impaired recruitment of DNA repair proteins
(e.g., RAD51) at sites of DNA damage.
Next, we analyzed the effect of the proteasome inhibitors on cell
cycle profile after exposure to IR (Fig. 6B). Inhibition of S-phase

DNA-damaging agents (chemotherapeutic drugs and IR) have
been used for cancer therapy for decades. The recent emergence of
a proteasome inhibitor as anticancer drug rendered its combination with DNA-damaging agents possible in clinical trial and has
already given promising results through mechanism(s) yet unknown (9, 10). In this study, we show that proteasome inhibition
leads to the inhibition of the general DNA damage response and
the Fanconi anemia pathway at multiple levels, leading to the
persistence of DNA damage and abrogation of G1-S cell cycle
checkpoint, thus providing for the first time a rationale for the
combination therapy.
We found that the proteasome function is required for both
basal and DNA damage–induced (IR, UV, DNA cross-linking agents,
and hydroxyurea) monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a critical step
for the activation of the Fanconi anemia pathway. The mechanisms
responsible for the inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination by
proteasome inhibition remain unclear, although we ruled out most
of the testable possibilities [activation of FANCD2 deubiquitinating
enzyme (USP1) and inactivation of the E2 (UBE2T) and E3 (Fanconi
anemia core complex) enzymes and the upstream kinase (ATR)
required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination] are not responsible for
the observed Fanconi anemia pathway inhibition. In addition,
although proteasome inhibition leads to the reduction of the free
cellular ubiquitin pool (26), the maintenance of PCNA monoubiquitination in response to DNA damage in cells treated with
proteasome inhibitors suggests that free ubiquitin is still available
to modify nuclear proteins at sites of DNA damage. The fact that
FANCD2 monoubiquitination was reduced on short exposure to
proteasome inhibitors, even in the absence of USP1, suggested the
involvement of another deubiquitinating enzyme yet to be
determined. We also found that proteasome inhibition led to the
inhibition of recruitment of numerous proteins involved in DNA
damage response at site of DNA damage induced by IR and DNA
cross-linking agents. Following proteasome inhibition, phosphoATM, 53BP1, NBS1, and BRCA1 foci formation was delayed,
FANCD2 and RAD51 foci were inhibited, whereas gH2AX, MDC1,
and RPA foci formed normally, as summarized in Fig. 6C.
The MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex detects DSBs and triggers the
recruitment and activation of ATM kinase through its autophosphorylation on Ser1981 (31, 38). Activated ATM phosphorylates
numerous substrates, including histone H2AX, NBS1, MDC1, CHK2,
SMC1, BRCA1, p53, and FANCD2, activating cell cycle checkpoints,
DNA repair, and apoptosis pathways (39). Histone H2AX phosphorylation induces MDC1 recruitment (40). Our findings that foci
formation of gH2AX and MDC1 and phosphorylation of ATM
substrates (ATM, CHK2, NBS1, and FANCD2) were not affected by

proteasome inhibition indicate that proteasome is not implicated
in these early DNA damage–signaling steps.
Foci formation of MDC1, 53BP1, and phospho-ATM occurs
rapidly after IR in an interdependent manner. 53BP1 recruitment is
dependent on MDC1, ATM (41), methylation of histone H4 Lys20

(42), and increased exposure of histone H3 methyl Lys79 due to
DSB-induced chromatin relaxation (43). Phospho-ATM recruitment
is dependent on MDC1 (44) and 53BP1 (data not shown). We
showed that both 53BP1 and phospho-ATM foci were inhibited on
proteasome inhibition, whereas MDC1 foci formation and ATM

Figure 6. Proteasome inhibition inhibits DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint. (Full-length blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. S3K). A, proteasome
inhibition led to persistent histone H2AX phosphorylation after DNA damage. HeLa cells were pretreated with bortezomib (1 Amol/L) for 4 h, irradiated (15 Gy),
and incubated for the indicated amount of time after IR. Whole-cells extracts were used for detection of FANCD2 and histone H2AX phosphorylation on Ser139 (cH2AX ).
B, proteasome inhibition impaired IR-induced cell cycle checkpoints. IMR90 primary fibroblasts were pretreated in MG132 (2 Amol/L) for 4 h, irradiated (15 Gy),
and incubated for the indicated amount of time after IR. Fifteen minutes before fixation, cells were pulse labeled with BrdUrd (30 Amol/L). Incorporation of BrdUrd
(Y axis ) and DNA content (propidium iodide; X axis ) was quantified by flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometric analyses and the mean value of the proportion
of cells in S phase are shown for each condition. C, schematic representation of the cellular response to IR-induced DNA damage. Orange, events sensitive to

formation of 53BP1, phospho-ATM, NBS1, BRCA1, FANCD2, and RAD51, and IR-induced phosphorylation of CHK1. Proteasome inhibition–resistant events include
ATM autophosphorylation (Ser1981), phosphorylation of H2AX (Ser139), CHK2 (Thr68), NBS1 (Ser343), and FANCD2 (Thr691), and nuclear foci formation of gH2AX,
MDC1, and RPA (see Discussion for the detail). DNA DSB , DNA double-strand break. FA, Fanconi anemia. HR , homologous recombination.

autophosphorylation remained unaffected, as well as histone H4
Lys20 methylation (data not shown). Induction of chromatin
relaxation using hypotonic buffer, histone deacetylase inhibitors
(trichostatin A and sodium butyrate), or chloroquine did not
restore 53BP1 foci formation (data not shown), suggesting that
inhibition of 53BP1 foci formation is not simply due to abnormally
condensed chromatin on proteasome inhibition. Thus, our results
suggest that proteasome proteolytic function is required for
recruitment of 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage marked by H2AX
phosphorylation and MDC1 recruitment. Lack of phospho-ATM
foci may in turn be subsequent to inhibition of 53BP1 foci.
BRCA1 and MRN complex foci form after MDC1/53BP1/phosphoATM foci. BRCA1 foci formation depends on MDC1 (40, 44) and
53BP1 (45), whereas accumulation of the MRN complex in nuclear
foci depends at least on MDC1 (44). We showed that BRCA1 and
NBS1 foci formation was delayed on proteasome inhibition, which,
in the case of BRCA1, may be a consequence of proteasome
inhibition–induced inhibition of 53BP1 foci.
Proteasome inhibition–induced inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination may explain inhibition of FANCD2 foci formation.
However, FANCD2 foci formation was more severely affected than
FANCD2 monoubiquitination in cells depleted for proteasome
subunits, suggesting that inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitination requires a more profound proteasome inhibition than
inhibition of foci formation. For example, in PSMD4- or PSMB3depleted cells, FANCD2 monoubiquitination was minimally
inhibited (Fig. 2C) but its foci formation was clearly inhibited
(Fig. 2D), suggesting that the proteasome function is required for
accumulation of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 in nuclear foci. The
inhibition of FANCD2 foci formation by the proteasome inhibition
may be secondary to impaired BRCA1 foci formation, as FANCD2
foci formation is dependent on BRCA1 (12).
RAD51 foci formation depends on formation of ssDNA (46). The
RPA complex binds ssDNA and allows the recruitment of ATRATRIP complex, RAD17, and RAD9. RAD51 displaces RPA from
ssDNA and catalyzes strand invasion required for homologydirected repair (46). CHK1 kinase activity, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are
required for RAD51 recruitment (47–49). We observed that RAD51
foci formation was inhibited on proteasome inhibition, whereas
RPA foci were not affected, suggesting that the generation of
ssDNA, required for RAD51 binding and HR, is not altered by
proteasome inhibition. BRCA1 foci and IR-induced CHK1 phosphorylation were inhibited on proteasome inhibition, which may
lead to lack of RAD51 foci. The observed delay/inhibition of DNA

repair, revealed by the persistence of histone H2AX phosphorylation, may be due to the proteasome inhibition–induced inhibition
of RAD51 foci formation, which will cause defect of HR. FANCD2
and RAD51 foci formation in response to DNA damage has recently
been shown to depend on HCLK2 (50). Whether HCLK2 is affected
by proteasome inhibition remains to be determined.
Taken together, our results reveal a new role of proteasome
proteolytic function in maintaining yet unidentified steps downstream of MDC1 and RPA foci formation, which control the foci
formation of 53BP1, phospho-ATM, BRCA1, NBS1, FANCD2, and
RAD51. The identification of these proteasome targets required for
the formation of these foci is ongoing.
As studies in budding yeast showed that subunits of both 19S
and 20S proteasomes are recruited to the site of DSB (18), it is
tempting to speculate that in human cells also the proteasome
accumulates at sites of DSB and is required for the recruitment of
DNA damage response/repair proteins. In that case, our results
suggest that the role of the proteasome at DSB would be to degrade
one or more proteins present at site of DNA damage during
DNA damage signaling rather than following the completion of
DNA repair. However, we were unable to reproducibly detect DNA
damage–inducible nuclear foci of the proteasome using six
different antibodies against different subunits of the proteasome
(data not shown). Whether the proteasome accumulates at sites of
DNA damage in mammalian cells remains unclear.
In summary, we conclude that the proteasome is involved in
many aspects of DNA damage response and controls monoubiquitination of FANCD2, foci formation of 53BP1, phospho-ATM,
NBS1, BRCA1, FANCD2, and RAD51, and IR-induced activation of
ATR-CHK1. Proteasome inhibitors may sensitize tumor cells to
DNA-damaging agents through the inhibition of these processes.
