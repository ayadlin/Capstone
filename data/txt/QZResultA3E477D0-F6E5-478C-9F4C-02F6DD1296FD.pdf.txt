Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Manganese superoxide dismutase is a nuclear encoded primary antioxidant enzyme localized
exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix. Genotoxic agents, such as UV radiation, generates
oxidative stress and cause mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. The mitochondrial DNA
polymerase (Polγ), a major constituent of nucleoids, is responsible for the replication and repair of
the mitochondrial genome. Recent studies suggest that mitochondria contain fidelity proteins and
MnSOD constitutes an integral part of the nucleoid complex. However, it is not known whether or
how MnSOD participates in the mitochondrial repair processes. Using skin tissue from C57/BL6
mice exposed to UVB radiation, we demonstrate that MnSOD plays a critical role in preventing
mtDNA damage by protecting the function of Polγ. Q-PCR analysis shows an increase in mtDNA
damage after UVB exposure. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies demonstrate p53
translocation to mitochondria and interaction with Polγ after UVB exposure. The mtDNA
immunoprecipitation assay with Polγ and p53 antibodies in p53+/+ and p53−/− mice demonstrates
an interaction between MnSOD, p53, and Polγ. The results suggest that these proteins form a
complex for the repair of UVB-associated mtDNA damage. The data also demonstrate that UVB
exposure injures the mtDNA D-loop in a p53-dependent manner. Using MnSOD-deficient mice
we demonstrate that UVB-induced mtDNA damage is MnSOD-dependent. Exposure to UVB
results in nitration and inactivation of Polγ, which is prevented by addition of the MnSOD
mimetic MnIIITE-2-PyP5+. These results demonstrate for the first time that MnSOD is a fidelity
protein that maintains the activity of Polγ by preventing UVB-induced nitration and inactivation of
Polγ. The data also demonstrate that MnSOD plays a role along with p53 to prevent mtDNA
damage.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a pro-oxidant and carcinogen that induces oxidative stress and
DNA damage (Aitken et al., 2007, Bickers and Athar 2006). UV irradiation leads to
increased stabilization and accumulation of tumor suppressor protein p53 in the skin. The
main contributing factor to non-melanoma skin cancer is UVB-induced signature mutations
in the p53 gene (Brash et al., 1991, Hall et al., 1993, Liu et al., 1994). N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC), superoxide dismutase, and catalase mimetic attenuate UVB-induced p53
stabilization without altering the transcriptional activation and cell cycle arrest functions of
p53, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in UVB-induced p53 stabilization and
accumulation (Decraene et al., 2004, Renzing et al., 1996). Increased cellular stress by ROS
triggers p53 translocation to mitochondria, leading to apoptosis and mtDNA repair (Mihara
et al., 2003, Mihara and Moll 2003, Waster and Ollinger 2009, Zhao et al., 2002, Zhao et
al., 2005).

mtDNA is organized in the inner mitochondrial membrane as nucleoids. The nucleoids
consist of mtDNA-protein macromolecular complexes containing 2–8 mtDNA molecules
associated with various proteins such as mitochondrial transcription factor A (mTFA), a
mitochondrial single-strand DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) and Polγ (Chen and Butow
2005, Garrido et al., 2003, Legros et al., 2004). mtDNA is more susceptible to UV-induced
damage than nuclear DNA is because it lacks histone and an elaborate repair system (Brown
et al., 1979, Shokolenko et al., 2009, Yakes and Van Houten 1997).

Author Manuscript

Polγ is the only known polymerase enzyme responsible for replication and repair of mtDNA
(Bogenhagen et al., 2001, Bolden et al., 1977, Hubscher et al., 1979, Longley et al., 1998,
Stuart et al., 2004). The Polγ holoenzyme is a heterotrimer consisting of 1 catalytic subunit
and 2 accessory subunits (Carrodeguas et al., 1999, Gray and Wong 1992, Yakubovskaya et
al., 2006). The Polγ catalytic subunit has polymerase and proof-reading activity for mtDNA
replication, and dRP (5′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate) lyase activity for base excision repair.
The accessory subunits bind nucleotide to mtDNA for faster replication, increased
processivity and protection of the catalytic subunit from ROS-mediated oxidative damage
(Johnson et al., 2000). Polγ is susceptible to oxidative modifications due to the presence of
31 tyrosine residues in the catalytic subunit, including the two highly conserved tyrosine
residues in the active site responsible for catalytic efficiency (Graziewicz et al., 2002,
Graziewicz et al., 2004, Lewis et al., 2006, Lim et al., 2003, Van Goethem et al., 2001).
UV irradiation triggers nitric oxide production in keratinocytes, which combines with
superoxide to form the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite (Maglio et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2010).
Inactivation of proteins by tyrosine nitration is regarded as a marker of nitrosative stress.
The importance of nitration to protein structure or function depends on the location of
tyrosine residues in the proteins; for example, its location in a loop or hydrophobic milieu
such as the active site of an enzyme (Alvarez and Radi 2003).

ROS produced in mitochondria are detoxified by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant
defense systems. The major constituents of the enzymatic system are MnSOD (Weisiger and
Fridovich 1973), glutathione peroxidase (Esworthy et al., 1997) and members of the
thioredoxin family (Holmgren 1985). MnSOD forms the first line of defense against the
superoxide produced in the mitochondria. Lack of MnSOD causes accumulation of
oxidative mtDNA damage as well as inactivation of respiratory and Krebs cycle enzymes
(Li et al., 1995b, Melov et al., 1999). Recent studies have identified MnSOD as a nucleoid
complex component that may protect mtDNA and proteins associated with mtDNA from
oxidative damage (Kienhofer et al., 2009). Further MnSOD enzymatic activity is regulated
by mitochondrial SIRT3 to maintain ROS levels and mitochondrial homeostasis (Ozden et
al., 2011, Tao et al., 2010). We propose that epidermal cells use the following novel dualstep strategy to counteract a UVB insult involving tumor suppressor protein p53 and
MnSOD 1) Damaged mtDNA recruit p53 to mitochondria where p53 might provide support
to mitochondrial DNA polymerase Polγ in repairing the damaged mtDNA; and 2) MnSOD
may act as a fidelity protein by interacting with Polγ and protecting it from oxidative stressinduced inactivation.

Results
UVB induces mtDNA damage in mouse skin

Author Manuscript

To assess mtDNA damage by UVB, we performed a time course study in which wild-type
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 5kJ/m2 of UVB radiation. mtDNA isolated from skin at 1
and 24 hr after exposure to UVB was subjected to quantitative PCR analysis. The mtDNA
damage was analyzed based on the difference in amplification due to blockage of the
recombinant Thermus thermophilus (rTth) DNA polymerase by UVB-induced lesions. PCR
negative control was used as a blank reference to eliminate background fluorescence. The
relative amplification plot in Fig.1 shows a significant decrease in amplification of 10 kb
mtDNA at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment compared to undamaged control template,
indicating an increase in mtDNA damage. A quantitative analysis of lesions induced by
UVB treatment in the 10 kb mtDNA is shown in Table 1. We normalized mtDNA copy
number variation using fluorescence values from amplified short mtDNA fragments (117
bp), as there is a very low probability that UVB treatment will introduce a lesion in small
mtDNA segments. This analysis indicates a significant increase in lesions at 1 hr and 24 hr
after UVB treatment, suggesting mtDNA is highly prone to damage by UVB treatment.
UVB induces p53 translocation to mitochondria in mice epidermal cells

Author Manuscript

We have previously observed p53 translocation to mitochondria in a multistage skin cancer
model using a known mutagenic chemical initiator, 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)-anthracene
(DMBA), followed by repetitive treatment with the tumor promoter 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which is a known tumor promoter (Zhao et al.,
2002). It has also been shown that p53 translocated into mitochondria after exposure to a
stress inducing agent including ionizing radiation (Vaseva and Moll 2009). To determine
whether UVB-induced mtDNA damage triggers p53 translocation to mitochondria in vivo,
skin mitochondrial fractions devoid of cytosolic and nuclear contamination were prepared
from mouse skin by a sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation process after UVB

treatment and subjected to immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A & 2B, the p53 level
increased significantly in both whole skin lysates and mitochondrial fractions at 1 hr and at
24 hr after UVB treatment. The absence of cytosolic and nuclear contamination was
confirmed by immunoblotting of the mitochondrial fractions with antibodies against
cytosolic and nuclear marker proteins IκBα and PCNA, respectively.
UVB enhances physical interaction of p53 with Polγ and mtDNA, and the role of p53 in
Polγ and mtDNA interaction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that p53 can directly interact with Polγ and mtDNA and
enhance Polγ repair efficiency (Achanta et al., 2005, Bakhanashvili et al., 2008, Heyne et
al., 2004). Here, we tested whether UVB could enhance p53 interaction with Polγ and
mtDNA. Mitochondria were isolated from the skin of wild-type C57BL/6 mice exposed to
5kJ/m2 of UVB radiation and the interaction between p53 and Polγ was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for p53 with subsequent detection of p53 or
Polγ by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, Polγ and p53 proteins pulled down from the
mitochondrial lysates by both p53 and Polγ antibodies increased at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB
treatment. We also determined UVB-induced p53 and mtDNA interaction by isolating
mtDNA from the skin of C57BL/6 wild-type mice exposed to 5kJ/m2 of UVB radiation. The
mtDNA immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody were purified and amplified by real-time
PCR with primers specific for mtDNA D-loop region to probe the relationship between
mtDNA and Polγ function. As shown in Fig. 3B, the amplification of the D-loop region of
mtDNA immunoprecipitated by p53 antibody increased significantly at 1 hr and 24 hr after
UVB treatment. To verify the role of p53 in mtDNA repair by Polγ after UVB treatment,
mtDNA immunoprecipitation was performed on p53+/+ and p53−/− mice at 1 hr and 24 hr
after UVB treatment. As shown in Fig. 3C, the amplification of the D-loop region of
mtDNA immunoprecipitated by Polγ antibody in p53+/+ mice increased significantly at 1 hr
and 24 hr after UVB treatment. The amplification level of the D-loop in p53−/− mice was
lower than that in the p53+/+ mice and did not change significantly in response to UVB
treatment. Thus, the significant increase in amplification of the D-loop region after UVB
treatment was limited to the p53+/+ genotypes, suggesting a role for p53 in the interaction of
Polγ with mtDNA.
UVB induces physical interaction of MnSOD with p53 and Polγ, and the effect of MnSOD
on Polγ and mtDNA

Author Manuscript

We have previously observed an interaction between p53 and MnSOD in the mitochondria
of epidermal cells exposed to DMBA and TPA (Zhao et al., 2002, Zhao et al., 2005). To
determine whether UVB causes p53 and MnSOD to interact in mitochondria, skin
mitochondrial lysates from UVB-treated wild-type C57BL/6 mice were immunoprecipitated
with p53 and MnSOD antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of MnSOD
and p53 proteins pulled down from mitochondrial lysates by p53 and MnSOD antibodies
increased at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated that
MnSOD is an integral part of the nucleoid complex (Kienhofer et al., 2009). Hence, we
tested whether UVB induces MnSOD and Polγ interaction using co-immunoprecipitation.
As shown in Fig. 4B, the amount of MnSOD and Polγ proteins pulled down from
mitochondrial lysates by Polγ and MnSOD antibodies increased at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB

treatment. We further used p53+/+ and p53−/− mice to perform a co-immunoprecipitation
study to determine whether UVB induces interaction between MnSOD and Polγ and
whether it is dependent on p53. As shown in Fig. 4C, the amount of MnSOD and Polγ
proteins pulled down from mitochondrial lysates by Polγ and MnSOD antibodies increased
at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment in both genotypes. To assess the role of MnSOD in
mtDNA and Polγ interaction after UVB treatment, mtDNA immunoprecipitation was
performed on MnSOD+/+ and MnSOD+/− mice. As shown in Fig. 4D, amplification of the
D-loop region of mtDNA immunoprecipitated by the Polγ antibody resulted in more than
1.5 fold increase at 1 hr after UVB treatment in both genotypes, and when compared
between the genotypes. Although the increase was less than 1.5 fold at 24 hr after UVB
treatment in both genotypes, the increase was significant in the MnSOD+/+ genotype at 24 hr
after UVB treatment. The results suggest that MnSOD interacts with both p53 and Polγ, but
the interaction between MnSOD and Polγ appears to be independent of p53. The results also
show that MnSOD enhances the Polγ/mtDNA interaction 24 hr after UVB-irradiation,
implying a role for MnSOD in maintaining Polγ activity.
MnSOD deficiency enhances UVB-mediated Polγ inactivation

Author Manuscript

To determine whether UVB treatment induces an alteration in Polγ protein level in the
mitochondria of MnSOD+/+ and MnSOD+/− mice, Western blotting for Polγ protein was
performed using skin mitochondrial lysates from UVB- treated wild-type C57BL/6 mice. As
shown in Fig. 5A, there was no apparent change in the Polγ protein level at 1 hr and 24 hr
after UVB treatment in either genotype. UVB induces OONO− production in skin by the
reaction of NO• with O2•− which nitrates proteins and that Polγ protein undergoes oxidative
damage-induced inactivation (Graziewicz et al., 2002, Wu et al., 2010). Polγ reverse
transcriptase activity assay was performed using the skin mitochondrial lysates from UVBtreated MnSOD+/+ and MnSOD+/− mice to determine whether UVB treatment results in a
change in Polγ activity in the mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 5B, Polγ reverse transcriptase
activity decreased significantly in MnSOD+/− genotype at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB
treatment compared to MnSOD+/+ mice, where a significant decrease in activity was
observed only at 24 hr after UVB treatment. To determine whether UVB-induced Polγ
inactivation is associated with nitration, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation study using
3-nitrotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 5C & 5D, the amount of Polγ protein pulled
down from the mitochondrial lysates by 3-nitrotyrosine antibody significantly increased at 1
hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment in MnSOD+/− mice. There was a significant difference
between the genotypes at 24 hr after UVB treatment, as shown in Fig. 5D. These results
suggest MnSOD may be important in preventing nitration and subsequent inactivation of
Polγ after UV exposure.

MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ rescues Polγ from inactivation by UVB-mediated nitration
Previous studies have clearly established MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ as a potent O2•− and OONO−
scavenger (Batinic-Haberle et al., 2010, Batinic-Haberle 2010). To test if Polγ could be
rescued from UV-induced inactivation, MnSOD+/− mice were pre-treated twice daily with
MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ at 5mg/kg body weight in 250 μl volume before UVB exposure. Polγ
reverse transcriptase activity assay was performed in skin mitochondrial lysates from saline
and MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ treated MnSOD+/− mice after UVB exposure. As shown in Fig. 6A,

Polγ reverse transcriptase activity in MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ pre-treated MnSOD+/− mice
increased significantly at 24 hr after UVB treatment and compared with saline pre-treated
MnSOD+/− mice. There was a significant decrease in activity in saline pre-treated
MnSOD+/− mice at 24 hr after UVB treatment. To determine whether MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ pretreatment reduces UVB-mediated Polγ inactivation by nitration, co-immunoprecipitation
was performed using 3-nitrotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 6B, the amount of Polγ
protein pulled down from the mitochondrial lysates by 3-nitrotyrosine antibody in saline
pre-treated MnSOD+/− mice increased significantly at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment.
There was no significant change in nitration levels in MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ pre-treated
MnSOD+/− mice. When compared with saline pre-treated MnSOD+/− mice, the decrease in
nitration in MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ pre-treatment was significant at 24 hr after UVB treatment, as
shown in Fig. 6C.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The present study demonstrates that UVB-induced mtDNA damage triggers p53
translocation to mitochondria, that mitochondrial p53 interacts with both mtDNA and Polγ
after UVB exposure, and that the mtDNA/Polγ association is dependent on the availability
of p53. These results support a previous report on the role of p53 in the mtDNA repair
process (Achanta et al., 2005, Bakhanashvili et al., 2008). We have previously shown that
oxidative stress induces p53 translocation to mitochondria and its subsequent interaction
with MnSOD in a multistage chemical carcinogenesis model (Zhao et al., 2002, Zhao et al.,
2005). The present study confirms these findings using UVB treatment to cause DNA
damage, and extends to demonstrate that UVB treatment leads to increased interaction
between MnSOD and Polγ and that the interaction between MnSOD and Polγ is p53
independent. These results suggest that MnSOD may participate in mtDNA repair processes
by acting as a fidelity protein protecting the function of the major DNA repair enzyme in the
mitochondria. This conclusion is supported by the findings that 1) MnSOD deficiency leads
to a decrease in mtDNA-Polγ interaction and 2) inactivation of Polγ by nitration is prevented
by treatment with MnIIITE-2-PyP5+, a potent peroxynitrite inhibitor. The findings of this
study verify that MnSOD is an integral part of the nucleoid complex and extend to
demonstrate that the antioxidant property of MnSOD serves to enhance the fidelity of
mtDNA repair by salvaging the DNA polymerase (Polγ) in mitochondria from UV-induced
peroxynitrite mediated inactivation.

Skin is the primary target of UVB radiation. UVB exposure has wide-ranging effects in skin,
such as erythema and epidermal hyperplasia, which can eventually lead to
photocarcinogenesis or photoaging. The underlying cellular processes for these conditions
include DNA damage, apoptosis and oxidative stress. Both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
can be damaged by UVB radiation. Owing to its uniqueness, mtDNA has been used as a
reliable biomarker for UV-induced DNA damage (Birch-machin et al., 1998, Harbottle and
Birch-Machin 2006, Krishnan et al., 2004). Our Q-PCR analysis of mitochondrial genome
indicates that UVB causes damage to mtDNA in mouse skin. The relative amplification ratio
of the 10 kb mtDNA fragment at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment was significantly less
than that of the reference control, which indicates the presence of DNA damage that blocks
the amplification process. There were 0.15 lesions per 10 kb per strand at both the 1 hr and

24 hr treatments compared to the reference control. An earlier report that used Q-PCR to
analyze UVB-exposed epidermal mtDNA from human skin shows deletions ranging from 4
to 10.5 kb in a 11.1 kb PCR fragment (Ray et al., 2000). Thus, in our model UVB-induced
mtDNA damage is being repaired.

UVB-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage stabilize p53 protein in the skin, leading to
DNA repair in proliferating basal keratinocytes but cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
differentiated keratinocytes (Berg et al., 1996, Li et al., 1997, Ouhtit et al., 2000, Renzing et
al., 1996, Tron et al., 1998). UVB signature mutations in the p53 gene may lead to
dysregulation of apoptosis and DNA repair, resulting in skin carcinogenesis (Li et al.,
1995a). Our results demonstrating p53-dependent UVB-induced mtDNA repair are
consistent with these findings. The increased physical interaction of p53 with mtDNA and
Polγ might be a p53 response to mtDNA damage after UVB treatment. A basal level of
interaction between mtDNA and Polγ has been observed in both p53+/+ and p53−/−
genotypes. This interaction can be attributed to a p53-independent mtDNA replication
process, since the very same basal level interaction between mtDNA and Polγ was observed
1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment in the p53−/− phenotype. In contrast, increased
interaction between mtDNA and Polγ was observed 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment in
p53+/+ mice. This increase from basal level can be attributed to mtDNA repair and indicates
that the interaction requires p53. The presence of p53 enhances the accuracy of mtDNA
repair by proof reading and by reducing the misincorporation of dNTP into mtDNA by Polγ
(Bakhanashvili et al., 2008). Recent studies have identified p53-regulated p53R2 as a
subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a rate-limiting enzyme in the denovo synthesis
of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) (Bourdon et al., 2007, Kulawiec et al., 2009, Lebedeva et
al., 2009). The UVB induced p53 stabilization triggers transcriptional up-regulation of
p53R2, and increases output of dNTPs required for the UVB induced mtDNA repair
process. This may be attributed to the increase in amplification of the D-loop region after
UVB treatment observed in Fig. 3B.

Author Manuscript

The diverse functions of mitochondrial p53, which range from maintaining mtDNA integrity
to apoptosis, led us to further explore our previous finding concerning MnSOD and p53
interaction in mitochondria. The physical interaction between p53 and MnSOD is observed
with UVB treatment as was seen in chemical carcinogenesis studies. In light of new
evidence that establishes MnSOD as an integral component of nucleoids (Kienhofer et al.,
2009), and our findings that a physical interaction occurs between MnSOD and Polγ after
UVB treatment and that this interaction is p53-independent, these results suggest that
MnSOD may enhance mtDNA stability by serving as a fidelity protein protecting the
function of the key mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme. The interaction between MnSOD
and Polγ and subsequent protection of Polγ from UVB-induced inactivation support a new
role for mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme MnSOD in maintaining mtDNA fidelity. Our
previous studies with MnSOD overexpressing and knockdown mice treated with
DMBA/TPA have clearly established that MnSOD prevents protein oxidation in
mitochondria (Zhao et al., 2001, Zhao et al., 2002). The decrease in the interaction between
mtDNA and Polγ after UVB treatment in MnSOD+/− mice might be attributed to increased
oxidative modification of Polγ. Oxidative stress in yeast due to a lack of MnSOD leads to

oxidation of various mitochondrial proteins such as aconitase, pyruvate, keto-acid
dehydrogenase reductoisomerase, acetolactate synthase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,
HSP60, glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate, and cytosolic fatty acid synthase (Cabiscol et al.,
2000, O’Brien et al., 2004). The Polγ protein is known to be sensitive to oxidative
modification when exposed to hydrogen peroxide (Graziewicz et al., 2002). The Polγ
exonuclease proof reading mutator mice have increased point mutations, mtDNA deletions,
and increased apoptosis that leads to accelerated aging (Kujoth et al., 2005, Trifunovic et al.,
2004, Vermulst et al., 2008). NO• and O2•− generated by UVB can result in OONO−
production in skin, leading to nitration of proteins (Wu et al., 2010). In this study we
provide evidence for the first time that Polγ nitration and the consequent inactivation after
UVB exposure are enhanced when MnSOD is deficient, and that pre-treatment of MnSOD
with MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ results in decreased nitration and inactivation of Polγ.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our study shows that MnSOD plays an important role in protecting the fidelity
of mtDNA against UVB-induced mtDNA damage in keratinocytes. We propose a model in
Fig. 7 to illustrate a novel dual-step strategy adapted by keratinocytes in response to UVB
insult that enhances the repair of mtDNA and protects the mtDNA repair enzyme from being
inactivated. On one hand, UVB-induced mtDNA damage triggers p53 translocation to
mitochondria. The mitochondrial p53 interacts with mtDNA and enhances the polymerase
and exonuclease activities of Polγ, which plays a major role in the mtDNA repair process
with its proof reading ability. On the other hand, mitochondrial antioxidant MnSOD plays a
novel role by interacting with Polγ and protecting it from peroxynitrite-mediated
inactivation. Circumstances that lead to increased oxidative stress by depleting MnSOD
level and/or decrease MnSOD activity by acetylation can result in Polγ inactivation.
Increasing MnSOD levels and/or activity by Sirt3 deacetylation enhances mitochondrial
O2•− scavenging and reduces ROS-mediated insult on vital mitochondrial proteins such as
Polγ. Additional studies aimed at identification of the specific tyrosine residues of Polγ that
are nitrated after UVB exposure, tyrosine residues that are responsible for reduced Polγ
activity and/or protected by MnSOD will provide further biochemical insight into the
mechanisms by which the nuclear encoded, mitochondrial localized protein, MnSOD, serves
to maintain the fidelity of the mtDNA and will establish a nuclear mitochondrial feed
forward loop in cellular adaptive responses against oxidative stress mediated mitochondrial
DNA instability.

previously (Mihara and Moll 2003). Briefly, mouse skin was homogenized with a polytron
homogenizer in calcium reticulocyte buffer (10mM Tris pH 7.6, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM
NaCl) and mixed with 2ml of ice-cold mannitol-sucrose buffer (210 mM mannitol, 70 mM
sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tris, pH 7.6). Two hundred microlitres of whole skin
homogenate was stored at −20°C for further use. The remainder of the whole skin
homogenate was centrifuged thrice at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to clear nuclear, cytosolic
and intact skin cell fraction. The mitochondria were isolated by discontinuous sucrose
gradient centrifugation.
Co-Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (Bonifacino et al., 2001).
Briefly, the protein A/G-agarose beads (40 μL) were conjugated overnight to Polγ, MnSOD,
p53 (DO-1), and 3-nitrotyrosine antibodies (3 μg) at 4°C in 0.5 mL ice-cold PBS.
Appropriate control antibody was used as negative control. The mitochondrial pellets were

lysed in denaturing buffer 1% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
10 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM EDTA, 15 U/ml DNase I, and 1 μL/mL Protease inhibition by
heat at 95°C for 5 min and the DNA was sheared. After denaturation and shearing, 250–500
μg of precleared mitochondrial protein were immunoprecipitated with antibody conjugated
protein A/G-agarose beads with 10 μL of 10% BSA incubated overnight at 4°C in tube
rotator. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed with 4–10% gradient gel.
mtDNA immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

The ChIP-IT system (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) was used to investigate the interaction of
Polγ, MnSOD, p53 (DO-1) and mtDNA. Briefly, skin mtDNA exposed to UVB was
immunoprecipitated with p53 and Polγ antibodies, and the mtDNA D-loop region was
quantified by real-time PCR (LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System, Roche). The
following primer sets were designed and used to amplify the mtDNA D-loop region: 5′ACTATCCCCTTCCCCATTTG-3′ a n d 5′-TGTTGGTCATGGGCTGATTA-3′. Equal
amounts of mtDNA from each treatment were used as input loading control, and mtDNA
pulled down by IgG served as the negative antibody control.
Polγ reverse transcriptase activity assay

Author Manuscript

The RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of Polγ was measured as described
previously (Longley and Copeland 2002, Taanman et al., 2010). Briefly, the mitochondrial
lysates prepared in extraction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 1% v/v
Triton-X 100) were assayed at 37°C for 10 min in 50 μL reaction mixture with 10 μg of the
mitochondrial protein, 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5
mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/mL poly(rA).oligo(dT)12–18, 100 μg/mL acetylated bovine
serum albumin (Ac-BSA), 0.1 mM aphidicolin, 500 μg/mL RNasin® RNase inhibitor
(Promega, Madison, WI) and 5 μM [α-32P]thymidine 5′-triphosphate (dTTP; specific
activity: 5 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Corp., Piscataway, NJ). The reaction was stopped with 1.0
ml of stop solution (500 mM NaOH, 100 mM sodium pyro-phosphate, 0.1 mg/mL sonicated
calf thymus DNA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA). The DNA precipitated with 20% TCA was filtered
through GF/C filters and washed thrice with 1N HCl, rinsed with 95% ethanol and dried.
The TCA-insoluble radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
Treatment with Mn-based porphyrin
The Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin (MnIIITE-2-PyP5+) was
synthesized as previously described (Batinic-Haberle et al., 1999, Ferrer-Sueta et al., 1999).
The mice were injected IP with 5 mg/kg of MnIIITE-2-PyP5+ in saline twice daily for 2 days
before UVB treatment.

Figure 1. Quantification of mtDNA damage in mouse skin induced by UVB radiation

Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 5kJ/m2 of UVB radiation. mtDNA was isolated
and analyzed with Q-PCR using primers specific for mouse mtDNA. The 10 kb mtDNA
fragment was amplified and the blockage of rTth DNA polymerase amplification by damage
in mtDNA was quantified in PCR products with Pico-Green dye. The relative amplification
levels at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment were normalized with untreated control. ***P <
0.001 compared with control.

(A) Skin mitochondrial lysates from wild-type C57BL/6 mice exposed to 5kJ/m2 of UVB
radiation were immunoprecipitated with p53 (DO-1), MnSOD antibodies, and control IgG.
Co-immunoprecipitated MnSOD and p53 were quantified by immunoblotting with specific
antibodies. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation of Polγ and MnSOD. Mitochondrial lysates from
mice skin exposed to UVB at 1 hr and 24 hr were immunoprecipitated with Polγ, MnSOD
antibodies, and control IgG. Co-immunoprecipitated Polγ and MnSOD were quantified by
immunoblotting with specific antibodies. (C) Mitochondrial lysates from p53+/+ and p53−/−
mice skin exposed to UVB were immunoprecipitated with Polγ, MnSOD antibodies and
control IgG. Co-immunoprecipitated Polγ and MnSOD were quantified by immunoblotting
with specific antibodies. (D) mtDNA isolated from MnSOD+/+ and MnSOD+/− mice skin
exposed to 5kJ/m2 of UVB radiation was immunoprecipitated with Polγ antibody. Real-time
PCR was used to amplify the precipitated mtDNA D-loop. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01,
compared with control; ^^P < 0.01 compared at 1 hr and 24 hr after UVB treatment; ##P <
0.01 compared between MnSOD+/+ and MnSOD+/− mice.
