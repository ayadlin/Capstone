Abstract
Lipid bodies (lipid droplets) are emerging as dynamic
organelles involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation.
Increased lipid body numbers have been described in tumor
cells; however, its functional significance in cancer has never
been addressed. Here, we showed increased number of lipid
bodies in tumor tissues from patients with adenocarcinoma of
colon submitted to surgical resection when compared with
an adjacent normal tissue. Accordingly, increased numbers of
lipid bodies were observed in human colon adenocarcinoma
cell lines and in a H-rasV12–transformed intestinal epithelial
cell line (IEC-6 H-rasV12) compared with nontransformed
IEC-6 cells. The functions of lipid bodies in eicosanoid
synthesis in cancer cells were investigated. CACO-2 cells
have increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
when compared with IEC-6 cells. We showed by immunolocalization that, in addition to perinuclear stain, COX-2 and
prostaglandin E (PGE) synthase present punctate cytoplasmic
localizations that were concordant with adipose differentiation–related protein–labeled lipid bodies. The colocalization
of COX-2 at lipid bodies was confirmed by immunoblot of
subcellular fractionated cells. Direct localization of PGE2 at its
synthesis locale showed that lipid bodies are sources of
eicosanoids in the transformed colon cancer cells. Treatment
with either aspirin or the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75
significantly reduced the number of lipid bodies and PGE2
production in CACO-2 and in IEC-6 H-rasV12 cells with effects
in cell proliferation. Together, our results showed that lipid
bodies in colon cancer cells are dynamic and functional active
organelles centrally involved in PGE2 synthesis and may
potentially have implications in the pathogenesis of adenocarcinoma of colon. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1732–40]

Introduction
Increased lipogenesis has emerged as a common phenotype to
numerous human carcinomas and has been associated to poor
prognosis in breast, prostate, and colon cancer (1, 2). Altered lipid
metabolism in cancer cells involves modulation of multiple
lipogenic enzymes (1, 2). In fact, enzymes involved in fatty acid
synthesis, as well as metabolic regulators, are potential targets for
antineoplastic intervention and chemoprevention (1, 2). In virtually
all organisms, including mammalian cells, cytoplasmic lipids are

stored in hydrophobic organelles called lipid bodies or lipid
droplets. Cytoplasmic lipid bodies are osmiophilic structures,
surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with a unique fatty acid
composition, have a neutral lipid rich core, and contain a variable
protein composition (3–5). Although in the past, the presence of
lipid bodies in cells were largely associated with lipid storage and
transport, it has become apparent that lipid bodies are dynamic
and functionally active organelles (4, 5).
Increased numbers of lipid bodies are described pathologic
observation in cancer cells both in experimental settings and in
clinical conditions (4). However, mechanisms that regulate lipid
body formation and their functional significance to the cellular
biology of the tumor are not known. Recent studies based on
lipid body content have shown that lipid bodies, beside their
rich lipid content, contain several functionally diverse types of
proteins, including adipose differentiation–related protein (ADRP)
and caveolin (6–9), lipid metabolic enzymes and proteins of Rab
family (10–12), eicosanoid-forming enzymes (13, 14), and protein
kinases, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogenactivated protein kinase, and protein kinase C (PKC; refs. 15–17).
Therefore, lipid bodies may function in lipid metabolism,
membrane trafficking, and intracellular signaling and might have
potential implications to mechanisms of cell proliferation and
differentiation.
In inflammatory cells, lipid bodies have important roles in
regulating arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4, n-6) metabolism. Indeed, AA,
an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid with signaling functions
and the precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, is stored in
its esterified form at lipid bodies (15, 18). Accumulating evidence
indicates that AA metabolism plays an important role in colon
carcinogenesis. Unesterified AA itself is a signal for apoptosis of
colon cancer cells, and conversely, enzymatic conversion of AA
or esterification of AA into lipid pools depletes unesterified AA,
thereby removing a proapoptotic signal and promoting carcinogenesis (19, 20). Different products of AA metabolism are also
implicated in carcinogenesis. As much as 80% to 90% of colon
carcinomas show an enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; prostaglandin H synthase) expression compared with normal intestinal
mucosa (21–23). COX-2 is the enzyme that catalyzes the ratelimiting step in eicosanoids synthesis, converting AA into
prostaglandins (24). Accordingly, high levels of prostaglandins,
particularly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), were observed in colorectal
cancers (25, 26). Moreover, compelling data from epidemiologic
studies, clinical trials, and animal experiments indicate that aspirin
and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibit
colorectal carcinogenesis (reviewed in refs. 27, 28).
Leukocyte lipid bodies associated with inflammatory responses
were shown to compartmentalize enzymes involved in AA release
(cPLA2; ref. 15) and metabolic conversion into prostaglandins

(COX) and leukotrienes (5-lipoxygenase; LTC4 synthase; refs. 13, 14).
Moreover, quantitative correlations between an enhanced generation of eicosanoids and levels of lipid body formation have been
established in different cell types, suggesting that lipid bodies
might function as specific sites involved in eicosanoids synthesis by
cells engaged in inflammation (14, 29, 30). Recently, direct
assessment of newly synthesized eicosanoids into its locale of
synthesis has placed lipid bodies as specific sites of LTC4 and PGE2
synthesis within inflammatory leukocytes (31, 32).
In the present study, the occurrence and functions of lipid bodies
in colon cancer were investigated. Here, we showed that human
colon adenocarcinoma cell lines and colon cancer biopsies from
patients present a drastic increase in lipid body numbers. Lipid
bodies in these cells contain COX-2 and are structurally distinct
cytoplasmic sites for PGE2 production in an adenocarcinoma cell
line. Furthermore, treatment with either aspirin or fatty acid
synthase (FAS) inhibitor inhibited PGE2 production and cell
proliferation that correlated to an inhibition of lipid body
formation in cancer cells. Together, our results place lipid bodies
as functional organelles involved in prostaglandin synthesis in
cancer cells and might have roles to the pathogenesis of colon
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Human subjects. Samples of colon cancer and adjacent grossly normalappearing tissue were obtained from three patients at the time of surgery
from patients undergoing colon surgical resection at Brazilian National
Cancer Institute. Control specimens were collected from the accompanying
normal mucosa distant at 5 to 10 cm from the carcinoma. Samples for
electron microscopy were immediately fixed as described below. This study
was carried out with approval of the Brazilian National Cancer Institute’s
Ethic Committee.
Cell culture. CACO-2, LOVO, HT-29, and HCT-116 cells were grown in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). IEC-6 cells were also
grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS supplemented with 0.1 unit of insulin.
All cells were grown at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
Production of recombinant retroviruses and infection of IEC-6 cells.
The retroviral expression vector pBabe-H-rasV12 has been previously
described and was kindly donated by Dr. Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory; ref. [33]). BD EcoPack2 ecotropic packing cell line (BD
Biosciences) was transiently transfected with retroviral vector by calcium
phosphate precipitation for 24 h. Cell-free virus–containing supernatant
was collected 48 h after transfection and concentrated using Amicon
Ultracel 50k (Millipore). The supernatant was supplemented with 8 Ag/mL
polybrene (FLUKA Chemie) and immediately used for spin infection (2  45
min at 380  g ) of 5  104 IEC-6 cells. Infected cells were incubated at 37jC
for further 24 h and selected for puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) resistance
(7.5 Ag/mL) for 14 d.
Lipid body staining and enumeration. Cells (5  106 per well) were left
unstimulated and untreated or treated with aspirin (500 Ag/mL) or C75
(50 Ag/mL) for 24 h. Lipid bodies were stained as previously described in
each triplicate well ([29]). In brief, cells (105 cells/mL) were fixed in 3.7%
formaldehyde in calcium/magnesium-free HBSS (pH 7.4), rinsed in
0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer, stained in 1.5% OsO4 (30 min), rinsed in
distilled water (dH2O), immersed in 1.0% thiocarbohydrazide (5 min), rinsed
in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer, restained in 1.5% OsO4 (3 min), rinsed, and
then dried and mounted. The morphology of fixed cells was observed, and
lipid bodies were enumerated by light microscopy with 100 objective lens
in 50 consecutively scanned cells.
Electron microscopy. Lipid bodies were analyzed as previously
described ([34]). Briefly, samples were fixed for 1 h in 1% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). Then, samples were washed with 0.1
mol/L cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) followed by a second wash with 0.1 mol/L
imidazole buffer (pH 7.5). Samples were then postfixed for 30 min with 2%

OsO4 diluted in 0.1 mol/L imidazole buffer, washed in the 0.1 mol/L
imidazole, dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and embedded in
PolyBed 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were stained for 2 min with lead
citrate and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Lipid bodies
were enumerated by electron microscopy in 100 consecutively scanned
cells.
Isolation of lipid bodies by subcellular fractionation. Lipid bodies
were isolated by subcellular fractionation based on the buoyancy property
of these lipid-rich organelles in sucrose gradients as described ([15, 16]).
CACO-2 cells (108/mL) in 20 mmol/L Tris, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 100 mmol/L KCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 10
Ag/mL benzamidin, 0.7 Ag/mL pepstatin, and 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 700c for 5
min at 4jC. The cavitate was collected dropwise and mixed with an equal
volume of disruption buffer containing 1.08 mol/L sucrose. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 5 min to remove the nuclei. The
supernatants were overlaid sequentially with 2.0 mL each of 0.27 mol/L
sucrose buffer, 0.135 mol/L sucrose buffer, and Top solution [25 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 1 mmol/L EGTA (pH 7.4)] and centrifuged at
35,000 rpm at 4jC for 1 h. Seven discrete fractions were collected
sequentially from top to bottom: a top layer of lipid body ( fraction 1), the
mid-zone between lipid bodies and cytosol ( fractions 2–3), the cytosol
( fractions 4–5), and the microsomal and pellet ( fractions 6–7). Proteins
from subcellular fractions were concentrated by precipitation with 20%
trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4jC. The precipitates were then washed
twice with cold acetone. The protein contents in the fractions were
analyzed by DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The activity of lactate
dehydrogenase was measured as cytosolic marker using the CytoTox 96
kit (Promega).
Western blotting. Proteins from cellular fractions or total cell lysates
prepared in reducing and denaturing conditions were separated by SDSPAGE on polyacrylamide gel. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes,
nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-Tween
[TBST; 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20].
Membranes were probed with anti-ADRP monoclonal antibody (mAb;
AP125, RDI), anti–COX-2 mAb (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-H-Ras
mAb (F132; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti–h-actin mAb (AC-40;
Sigma-Aldrich) in TBST with 1% nonfat dry milk. Proteins of interest were
then identified by incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) in TBST with 1%
milk. The membrane was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Biosciences) reagent, and the luminescence was captured by
exposure to an autoradiography film.
Immunolocalization. CACO-2 cells (2  104/mL) were fixed in 3%
formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with
0.05% saponin/HBSS solution for 10 min. The unspecific sites were blocked
with 1% normal human serum for 10 min. The cells were incubated for
1 h simultaneously with goat polyclonal anti–COX-2 (C-20; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or goat polyclonal anti–PGE synthase (PGES; S-16; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse monoclonal anti-ADRP (AP125; RDI)
diluted in 0.05% saponin/HBSS solution. Then, cells were blocked with
1% donkey serum for 10 min before simultaneous incubation with
Cy3-conjugated affiniPure F(ab¶) fragment donkey anti-mouse and Cy2conjugated affiniPure F(ab¶) fragment donkey anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 45 min. Then, cells were washed several times
with HBSS, mounted in an aqueous mounting medium, and visualized with
100 objective by both phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy.
Immunodetection of PGE2 at its sites of production. Immunodetection of PGE2 was performed as previously described ([32]). In brief, cells
(2  104/mL) were fixed and permeabilized during 1 h at 37jC with watersoluble 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC; 0.5% in
HBSS). Then, cells were washed with HBSS and blocked with 2% donkey
serum for 15 min before incubation with anti-PGE2 mAb (Cayman
Chemicals) for 45 min. The cells were washed with HBSS and incubated
with Cy3-conjugated affiniPure F(ab¶) fragment donkey anti-mouse for
45 min. Lipid bodies were fluorescent labeled with Bodipy 493/503
(Molecular Probes), added together with the secondary antibodies. The

cells were washed with HBSS, then mounted in an aqueous mounting
medium, and visualized with 100 objective by both phase contrast and
fluorescence microscopy. The specificity of the PGE2 immunolabeling was
ascertained by the incubation (10 min before EDAC) with the COX inhibitor
indomethacin (10 Ag/mL) to avoid the synthesis of PGE2 and by the use of
an isotype control (MOPC 31c; BD Pharmigen).
Cell proliferation assay. Cells (5  104 per well) were left unstimulated
and untreated or treated with aspirin (500 Ag/mL) or C75 (50 Ag/mL) for 24,
48, 72, and 96 h. After treatment, cell proliferation was assayed in each
triplicate well. Briefly, cells were fixed with ethanol for 10 min, stained with
0.05% violet crystal in 20% ethanol for 10 min, solubilized with methanol,
and read by spectrometer at 595 nm.
EIA. Cells (2  106 per well) were left unstimulated and untreated or
treated with aspirin (500 Ag/mL) or C75 (50 Ag/mL) for 24 h. After the
treatment, PGE2 was assayed in each triplicate well supernatant.
Determination of PGE2 levels by enzyme immunoassay was accomplished
using PGE2 monoclonal enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of values from control and
treated groups was determined using an unpaired Student’s t test for single
comparison or an ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls for
multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results
Lipid bodies are increased in human colon cancer.
Ultrastructural evaluation of lipid bodies were performed by
electron microscopy of paired samples of human colon cancer
and normal tissue distant from the tumor. Patients’ pairs of
samples of cancer and nonneoplastic tissues were processed as

described in material and methods. Analysis of adenocarcinoma of
colon from patients showed round, nonmembrane-bound lipid
bodies exhibiting variable osmiophilia, ranging from light to strong
electron dense organelles that were prominently increased in
number and size in tumor tissues when compared with a normal
tissue from the same patient submitted to surgical resection
(Fig. 1A). Electron microscopy quantitative analyzes showed a
dramatic increase in lipid body numbers in all studied patients
(Fig. 1B). Moreover, lipid bodies in tumor tissues were imaged as
heterogeneous organelles. They frequently displayed lucent areas
and granular and/or membranous internal structures or showed
irregular surfaces (Fig. 1). Images suggesting budding, coalescence,
or fusions of lipid bodies were identified (Fig. 1). Remarkably, lipid
bodies from tumor tissues showed clear interaction with nucleus,
ER, and mitochondria (Fig. 1C and D).
Adenocarcinoma cell line CACO-2 presents an increased
number of lipid bodies, COX-2 overexpression, and high levels
of PGE2 production. To evaluate the possible involvement of lipid
bodies in the pathogenesis of colon cancer, the presence of lipid
bodies in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (CACO-2 cells)
was compared with a nontransformed rat intestinal epithelial cell
line (IEC-6 cells). Both cell lines were maintained in culture
medium by 24 h and stained with osmium tetroxide. As shown in
Fig. 2A, CACO-2 cells present enhanced lipid body formation when
compared with IEC-6 cells, which have few or absence of these
cytoplasmic structures. Electron microscopy analysis showed
cytoplasmic organelles that were identified by their shape,

osmiophilia, and lack of a limiting membrane as lipid bodies
(Fig. 2B). Images suggesting fusion of lipid bodies with each other
were frequently observed, as well as, interactions with other
organelles including ER, nuclei, and cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 2B
and data not shown).
Quantitative analysis of lipid bodies shows a 4-fold to 5-fold
increase of lipid bodies numbers in CACO-2 cells when compared
with IEC-6 cells (Fig. 3A). To evaluate if increased lipid body
numbers were a unique feature of CACO-2 cells or if it was a
common aspect to other human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines,
LOVO, HT-29, and HCT-116 cells were analyzed (Fig. 3A). Increased
lipid body numbers in all these cancer cell lines were observed
when compared with IEC-6 cells (Fig. 3A). Several evidences
suggest that the inflammatory process and COX-2 have a central
role in colorectal carcinogenesis. COX-2 expression was evaluated
in CACO-2 and IEC-6 cell lines. Western blot analysis showed
increased expression of COX-2 protein in CACO-2 cells when
compared with IEC-6 cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, CACO-2 cells
also presented an enhanced production of PGE2 when compared
with IEC-6 cells (Fig. 3C).
Lipid bodies are sites for PGES and COX-2 localization and
PGE2 production in adenocarcinoma cell line. Lipid bodies in
inflammatory cells have been shown to function as main sites
involved in the oxidative metabolism of AA and eicosanoid
synthesis (reviewed in ref. 5). To address the relationship between
COX-2 and lipid bodies in cancer cells, the cellular compartment
for COX-2 localization was evaluated. Initially, CACO-2 cells were
subject to subcellular fractionation, and then cellular fractions
were immunoblotted with anti-COX-2. ADRP was used as a marker
of lipid bodies for colocalization purpose. ADRP is ubiquitously
expressed in many cells and tissues as a major component of lipid
droplets (6, 7). As shown in Fig. 4A, COX-2 protein localize in
fractions where lipid bodies and nuclei are isolated. On the other
hand, ADRP, a protein that is associated to lipid bodies in different
cell types, only localize in the lipid body fraction (Fig. 4A).
We then used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to
confirm the localization of COX-2 in intact cells with specific
conditions for fixation and permeabilization, which prevent
dissolution of lipid bodies. In CACO-2 cells, lipid bodies are readily
visualized by a strong ring shape staining for ADRP, indicating a
staining pattern localized to the peripheral surface of lipid bodies

www.aacrjournals.org

similar to the staining pattern for ADRP-associated lipid body in
adipocytes and other cells (6, 7). CACO-2 cells stained with anti–
COX-2 polyclonal antibody, in addition to perinuclear membrane,
showed focal punctate cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 4B, top). The
presence of COX-2 within lipid body was confirmed by ADRP and
COX-2 colocalization within CACO-2 cells (Fig. 4B, top). Interestingly, COX-2 lipid body staining was not restricted to lipid body
surface, suggestive that COX-2 pervade lipid body core (Fig. 4B
insert). PGE2 is formed from AA by cyclooxygenase-catalyzed
formation of PGH2 and further transformation by downstream
terminal enzyme PGES (35). Next, we evaluated the localization of
the inducible isoform of PGES, mPGES, in CACO-2 cells. As shown
in Fig. 4B (bottom), mPGES shows a similar localization pattern as
the observed for COX-2 with colocalization with ADRP-labeled lipid
bodies in addition to perinuclear staining.
Because CACO-2 cells have increased COX-2–enriched and
PGES-enriched lipid bodies and enhanced PGE2 formation, we
hypothesized that lipid bodies were domains for compartmentalized PGE2 synthesis. To investigate intracellular sites of newly
formed PGE2 in colon cancer cells, a recently developed strategy for
direct in situ immunolocalization of PGE2 synthesis were used (32).
EDAC was used to cross-link eicosanoid carboxyl groups to amines
in adjacent proteins, and immobilized PGE2 was immunoflorescently detected. CACO-2 cells showed intense and punctate
immunofluorescent staining for PGE2 (Fig. 4C, top). As shown in
Fig. 4C (top right), PGE2 intracellular site of production match

bodipy-stained lipid bodies, placing lipid bodies as sites of
PGE2 synthesis within colon cancer cells. Of note, perinuclear
PGE2-positive staining could also be observed. Specificity of the
immunofluorescence for PGE2 was ascertained by the lack of PGE2
immunolabeling within indomethacin pretreated CACO-2 cells
(Fig. 4C, bottom ) and also supported by the absence of
immunostaining when an isotype control antibody replaced the
anti-PGE2 mAb (data not shown). These results showed that lipid
bodies are intracellular sites for COX-2 and mPGES protein
localization and locales of newly formed PGE2 production in colon
cancer cells.
Aspirin and FAS inhibitor C75 inhibited lipid body
formation, PGE2 production, and proliferation in adenocarcinoma cell line. NSAIDs, which inhibit COX, are used as
chemopreventive agents for carcinogenesis of colon and cause
apoptosis of cancer cells. The mechanism for this response is not

fully understood, but it might result from an absence of a
prostaglandin product, an accumulation of AA substrate, or
shunting of substrate into a different pathway (28, 36). In addition,
NSAIDs, including aspirin and NS398, have been previously shown
to inhibit lipid body formation induced by cys-unsaturated fatty
acids through COX-independent mechanisms (29, 37). The capacity
of aspirin to inhibit lipid body formation in CACO-2 cells was
investigated. CACO-2 cells were left untreated or treated with
aspirin (500 Ag/mL) for 24 hours, and lipid bodies and PGE2 were
evaluated as described above. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, aspirin
inhibited lipid body formation and PGE2 generation in CACO-2
cells. To gain further insights on the functions of lipid bodies in
eicosanoid metabolism and roles in cell growth, we analyzed the
effect of a noncyclooxygenase inhibitor of lipid body biogenesis.
To this end, CACO-2 cells were treated with the FAS inhibitor
C75. FAS is the key biosynthetic enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis.

in most human cancer, including colon cancer (38, 39) and its
increased expression and activity associated to poor prognosis in
cancer (reviewed in ref. 2). Moreover, it has been well established
that FAS pharmacologic inhibition or knockdown by RNA
interference leads to selective cytotoxic to human cancer cells
(40–42). The mechanisms involved in FAS-induced killing of cancer
cells remain an area of intense investigation. The effect of C75 in
lipid body formation and PGE2 production was analyzed. As shown
in Fig. 5A, C75 significantly inhibited lipid body biogenesis in
CACO-2 cells. Accordingly, C75 was shown to significantly inhibit
lipid body formation in preadipocytes (43). Strikingly, although C75
is not an enzymatic inhibitor of COX-2 it significantly inhibited
PGE2 production by CACO-2 cells (Fig. 5B), thus suggesting that
COX-2 compartmentalization within lipid bodies play roles in the
enhanced PGE2 synthetic capacity by colon cancer cells. It should
be noted that cell viability 24 hours after treatment with either C75
or aspirin was greater then 95% as assessed by trypan blue
exclusion (not shown).
We next examined the effect of aspirin or C75-induced inhibition
of lipid body formation in CACO-2 cellular proliferation. CACO-2
cells were left untreated or treated with aspirin (500 Ag/mL) or C75
(50 Ag/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. As shown in Fig. 5C, CACO-2
cells presented an enhanced proliferation when compared with

www.aacrjournals.org

IEC-6 cells. However, the treatment with either aspirin or C75
significantly decreased the CACO-2 cells proliferation at levels of
IEC-6 cells (Fig. 5C).
Aspirin and FAS inhibitor C75 inhibited lipid body
formation, PGE2 production, and proliferation in H-Ras
transformed IEC-6. To gain further insight into the association
of cell transformation and lipid body biogenesis, we transformed
IEC-6 cells with a retrovirus construct of H-rasV12. Consistent with
published data (44), oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation of
intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6 H-rasV12) shows COX-2 overexpression (Fig. 6A) and is associated with an increased cell
proliferation phenotype (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6, H-Ras transformed IEC-6 exhibits highly increased lipid body biogenesis
(Fig. 6C) and enhanced PGE2 production (Fig. 6D) when compared
with IEC-6 cells. In addition, treatment with phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA; 10 nmol/L for 1 h) increased lipid body formation
in IEC-6 cells (4.8 F 2.5 in untreated to 23.6 F 3.5 lipid bodies per
cell in IEC-6 cells treated with PMA; P < 0.05).
As shown in Fig. 5C and D, pretreatment with either aspirin (500
Ag/mL) or C75 (50 Ag/mL) significantly inhibited lipid body
biogenesis and PGE2 in IEC-6 H-rasV12 cells. Furthermore, the
treatment with either aspirin or C75 in parallel to the inhibition of
lipid body formation significantly decreased the IEC-6 H-rasV12
cell proliferation to the levels of IEC-6 cells (Fig. 6B). Of note,
pretreatment with aspirin or C75 failed to inhibit basal lipid body
numbers in wild-type IEC-6 (Fig. 6C) and inhibited IEC-6 cell
growth in <30% within 72 hours (not shown).

Discussion
Lipid bodies are increasingly recognized as dynamic and
multifunctional organelles in different cell systems and organisms.
The occurrence and functions of lipid bodies in cancer cells are
largely unknown. Here, we showed that lipid bodies are increased
in neoplasic cells. Furthermore, lipid bodies in colon cancer cells
are functionally active organelles that compartmentalize eicosanoid-forming enzymes and are sites for newly formed lipid
mediator (PGE2) production. Together, these findings yielded
insights into the functions of lipid bodies in AA metabolism in
cancer cells and place lipid bodies as potential targets for
therapeutic interventions.
Inflammation is considered a well-established cancer risk factor,
and a number of inflammatory conditions predispose to colon
cancer, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (45, 46).
Increased biogenesis of lipid bodies has been extensively characterized in cells associated with several human inflammatory diseases
(reviewed in ref. 5), including infiltrating leukocytes and intestinal
epithelium of patients with Crohn’s disease (47). We showed drastic
increased numbers of lipid bodies in the tumor tissues from patients
with adenocarcinoma of colon submitted to surgical resection when
compared with paired normal tissues. Lipid bodies within adenocarcinoma cells appeared as round amorphous osmiophilic
inclusions showing variable electron densities and frequently
showed an electron-dense rim, devoid of a bilayer membrane,
typical features of lipid bodies in other cells. Although our study is
limited by its small sample size, it gives support to future studies
with large numbers of patients where the relationship between lipid
bodies and the different aspects of colon cancer, including the stage,
invasiveness, and the outcome could be addressed.
The surface of lipid bodies in cancer cell was shown to be
enriched with the protein ADRP, which is in agreement with

previous demonstrations that ADRP is the main surface protein of
lipid bodies in different mammalian cells, including epithelial cells.
Accumulating data points to an important role of ADRP in fatty
acid uptake, cholesterol, and fatty acid binding and neutral lipid
storage (48) and although the biological function of ADRP is not
completely known, this protein is a specific probe for lipid bodies
enabling its subcellular localization within intact cells and
subcellular gradients (6, 7). To assess discrete sites involved in
eicosanoid synthesis, eicosanoid-forming enzymes may be immunolocalized at specific intracellular sites. Based on immunolocalization studies of eicosanoid-forming enzymes in many cells, major
sites of synthesis of cyclooxygenase pathway-derived eicosanoids
are believed to be the ER and perinuclear membranes (24). In
addition, extranuclear lipid bodies have been described as sites to
where different enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis,
including cPLA2 and COX-2, translocate upon leukocyte stimulation in inflammatory conditions (13–15, 30). Different evidences
support the hypothesis that lipid bodies in neoplasic cells function
as distinct intracellular domain for regulated eicosanoid production. First, lipid bodies were sites of COX-2 and PGES compartmentalization. Second, in this study we observed a significant
correlation between lipid body numbers and PGE2 generation in
cancer colonic epithelial cells and in H-rasV12 transformed
epithelial cells. Moreover, PGE2 production was shown to occur
at lipid bodies. Direct assessment of intracellular sites for
prostaglandin generation has been elusive, as prostanoids and
other eicosanoids are newly formed, nonstorable, and rapidly
released upon cell stimulation. Recently, a new strategy to crosslink newly formed eicosanoids at its sites of synthesis has been
described, enabling the immunofluorescent localization of newly
formed eicosanoids at their intracellular formation locale and
demonstrating that intracellular compartments involved in both
leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis differ according with the
cell type studied and the stimulatory conditions used (31, 32). By

investigating intracellular domains involved in prostaglandin
synthesis in colon carcinoma cells, we showed that lipid bodies
are intracellular domains for PGE2 synthesis, placing lipid bodies as
important sites in the cellular processing and metabolism of AA, in
addition to nuclear membrane in colon cancer cells.
Increased lipid body biogenesis may contribute in different ways
to cancer progression. As mentioned above, lipid body arachidonylphospholipids might provide a source of substrate AA leading to
increased prostaglandin synthesis without requiring the perturbation of the integrity of membranes and directly coupled to
cocompartmentalized PGES and COX-2. Lipid bodies could also
function as a draining compartment to rapidly take up and
reacylate free AA within lipid body lipids, with potentially
detrimental outcomes for the host cell as AA has important
functions in inducing apoptosis of tumor cells (19, 20).
Together, our results showed that adenocarcinoma of colon
beside overexpression of COX-2, have increased numbers of lipid
bodies equipped with active PGE2-synthesizing machinery. These
results prompt us to address if lipid body inhibition would have an
effect on neoplastic cell proliferation. Different classes of drugs
have been described with the capacity to inhibit lipid body
formation, although no specific lipid body inhibitor has been
identified thus far (reviewed in ref. 5). Thus, to address the
hypothesis of lipid body involvement in colon cancer proliferation,
parallel assessment of lipid bodies, PGE2 production, and CACO-2
cell proliferation was obtained with two different classes of drugs
that inhibit lipid body formation.
Epidemiologic studies showed that individuals who have taken
NSAIDs have a markedly reduced risk of developing colon cancer.
In mice, COX-2 inhibitors or traditional NSAIDs lower the
incidence of polyps and cancer. It was suggested that inhibition
of tumors by NSAIDs involves the common property of COX
suppression and the resultant reduction in levels of prostaglandins
in tissues (reviewed in refs. 28, 36). Our data show that treatment

with aspirin significantly reduced the number of lipid bodies and
PGE2 levels in CACO-2 and IEC-6 H-rasV12 cells (Figs. 5 and 6). The
mechanisms involved in aspirin inhibition of lipid body biogenesis
are not completely understood. Indeed, previous findings showed
that lipid body biogenesis can be induced in COX-deficient cells
and aspirin are able to inhibit lipid body formation even in COXdeficient cells, thus suggesting that aspirin inhibitory effect on lipid
body biogenesis involves COX-independent mechanisms (29, 37).
Clinical and experimental evidence strongly suggest that NSAIDs
are anticarcinogenic, antiproliferative, and antineoplastic. In fact,
the oncogenic potentials of the prostaglandins were related to its
properties to promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in
intestinal epithelial cells (49–51). We observed that CACO-2 cells
present a progressive growth when compared with nontransformed
epithelial intestinal cells. Inhibition of lipid body formation by
either aspirin or FAS inhibitor, correlated to inhibition of PGE2
generation and cell proliferation (Figs. 5 and 6). Thus, our data
provides one more possible mechanism by which NSAIDs and FAS
inhibitors exert their effects as anticarcinogenic drug. The
inhibition of lipid body generation may affect the subcellular
compartmentalization of COX-2 and in consequence inhibit the
enhanced prostaglandin synthesis that is related to the pathogenesis of colon cancer.
Besides of its function as organelles involved in the generation of
eicosanoids, lipid bodies constitute sites of compartmentalization

of several signaling-relevant proteins, which may have functions
beyond AA metabolism. Indeed, proteins with well-established
roles in oncogenic cell transformation, tumorigenesis, and
metastasis, including PI3K, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1
(ERK1), ERK2, p38, PKC, and caveolin, were shown to localize in
lipid bodies in a variety of cell types (8, 9, 15–17, 52). In addition,
lipid body–specific protein ADRP has been recently described as a
potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for renal cell and
hepatocellular carcinoma (53, 54). In conclusion, our findings place
lipid bodies as dynamic and functional active organelles centrally
involved in PGE2 synthesis in colon cancer cells that might
potentially have implications with the pathogenesis of adenocarcinoma of colon. Thus, the evaluation of lipid bodies in human
tissues could potentially be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic
index in colon cancer or even as potential target to generate new
drugs for cancer treatment.
