BACKGROUND: Southwest Oncology Group 0124 was a large North American phase 3 trial that failed to confirm a
survival benefit for cisplatin/irinotecan over cisplatin/etoposide in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer
(SCLC). These results were contrary to Japan Clinical Oncology Group 9511, a phase 3 trial exclusively in Japanese
patients. Because 0124 and 9511 used identical treatment regimens and similar eligibility criteria, patient-level data
were pooled from both trials, and a common arm analysis was performed to explore potential reasons for the divergent results. METHODS: Patients with documented extensive stage SCLC and adequate end-organ function were
randomized to intravenously receive either cisplatin 60 mg/m2 Day 1 þ irinotecan 60 mg/m2 Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4
weeks or cisplatin 80 mg/m2 Day 1 þ etoposide 100 mg/m2 Days 1-3 every 3 weeks. Demographic and outcome data
were compared among 805 patients enrolled in 9511 and 0124 receiving identical treatment using a logistic model
adjusted for age, sex, and performance status (PS). RESULTS: Of 671 patients in 0124, 651 eligible patients were
included, as were all 154 patients from 9511. Significant differences in sex and PS distribution as well as toxicity were
seen between trials. There were also significant differences in response rates (87% vs 60%, P<.001) and median overall survival (12.8 vs 9.8 months, P<.001) when the cisplatin/irinotecan arms from both trials were compared. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in patient demographics, toxicity, and efficacy were identified in the 9511 and 0124
populations. These results, relevant in the current era of clinical trials globalization, warrant: 1) consideration of differential patient characteristics and outcomes among populations receiving identical therapy; 2) utilization of the common arm model in prospective trials; and 3) inclusion of pharmacogenomic correlates in cancer trials where ethnic/

Lung cancer represents the most common cause of malignant disease globally. Almost 1.4 million new cases of
lung cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide, with nearly 1.2 million deaths.1 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a unique
subtype of lung cancer that accounts for approximately 15% of all new cases.2 Unfortunately, most SCLC patients
die from the disease, due commonly to systemic metastasis (defined as ‘‘extensive stage’’).3,4 Over the past 20 years,
standard therapy for most patients with extensive stage SCLC has been either carboplatin or cisplatin in combination
with etoposide.5

Comparative Outcomes Analysis in SCLC/Lara et al

This paradigm was challenged in 2002, when the
results of the Japanese phase 3 study Japan Clinical Oncology Group 9511, comparing etoposide/cisplatin with
cisplatin/irinotecan in 174 patients, demonstrated that tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall
survival (OS) rates were significantly higher in the cisplatin/irinotecan group.6 It must be noted that 9511 was
stopped early at interim analysis by its data safety monitoring board when prospectively prespecified efficacy parameters were met.
Subsequently, the Southwest Oncology Group conducted a large phase 3 trial (0124) involving 671 patients
that used virtually the same eligibility criteria and treatment regimens as the Japanese trial to confirm the results
of 9511 in North American patients.7 As reported previously, 0124 found no statistical differences in tumor
response, PFS, and OS between the 2 arms, contrary to
the results of 9511.
To explore potential reasons for the divergent results
of these identically designed phase 3 trials, a pooled comparative outcomes analysis inclusive of patient-level data
from both trials was conducted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients in both trials had cytologically or histologically
confirmed SCLC and clinical evidence of extensive stage
disease (defined by distant metastasis, contralateral hilarnode metastasis, or malignant pleural effusion). Eligibility
criteria for both trials were similar and have been previously reported. Patients were randomly assigned to receive
either etoposide/cisplatin or cisplatin/irinotecan. The cisplatin/irinotecan regimen consisted of 4 cycles of 60 mg
of irinotecan per square meter of body surface area on
Days 1, 8, and 15 and 60 mg of cisplatin per square meter
on Day 1. Cycle length for this arm was 4 weeks. The etoposide/cisplatin regimen consisted of 4 cycles of 100 mg
of etoposide per square meter on Days 1, 2, and 3 and 80
mg of cisplatin per square meter on Day 1. Cycle length
for this arm was 3 weeks.
All patients underwent evaluations every cycle that
included an assessment of symptoms, a physical examination, a complete blood count, and blood chemistry studies. Tumor response was assessed after every 2 cycles. In
the 0124 trial, tumor response was evaluated according to
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,
whereas in the 9511 trial, the World Health Organization
criteria were used.8 OS was calculated as the time between
trial registration and death or date of last contact. PFS was

calculated as the time between trial registration and death
or progression, with censoring if alive without progression
at last contact.
Study Design and Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of both studies was to compare the
survival in patients with extensive SCLC treated with etoposide/cisplatin (standard arm) with that in comparable
patients treated with the cisplatin/irinotecan (experimental) on an intent-to-treat basis. As 0124 and 9511 protocols used identical treatment regimens and similar
eligibility criteria, patient-level data from both trials were
pooled to explore potential reasons for the divergent
results. Final results of both trials have previously been
reported. Of 671 patients in 0124, 651 were eligible and
included in this analysis, as were all 154 patients from
9511. Patient demographics, toxicity, and outcomes were
compared among 805 patients receiving identical treatment using a common arm analysis. OS and PFS as compared between the Japan and US trials for both treatment
arms in the combined sample were analyzed using Cox
proportional hazards regression, adjusted for age, sex, and
performance status. A logistic model adjusted for age, sex,
and performance status was used to compare response to
treatment between the 2 trials for the 2 treatment arms.
The existence of possible interactions between trial (Japan
Clinical Oncology Group vs Southwest Oncology Group)
and treatment arm was evaluated for all endpoints, using
data pooled over both arms. Significance was set at
P<.05.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
Median age in 9511 and 0124 was 61 and 62 years,
respectively. There were proportionally more men in
9511 (86%, n ¼ 132) compared with 0124 (57%, n ¼
370). There were more patients with Zubrod performance
status 0 in 0124 (211, 32%) compared with 9511 (19,
12%). Demographics are summarized in Table 1.
Toxicity
Common arm comparisons of select attributable hematologic toxicities are summarized in Table 2. Regardless of
treatment arm, patients in 9511 experienced significantly
more hematologic toxicity consisting of neutropenia, leucopenia, and anemia than 0124. Other than a difference
in infection rates in the cisplatin/etoposide arm, no

differences in nonhematologic toxicities between the 2 trials were seen.

Treatment Delivery and Dose Intensity
In the original 9511 and 0124 papers, there were no significant differences reported between the 2 arms in
terms of treatment delivery. A preliminary common
arm comparison of treatment delivery and dose intensity (DI) was performed in the current analysis. These
results are summarized in Table 3. There were no clear
differences in the proportion of patients completing all
4 cycles of therapy. However, a higher proportion of
patients completed all 4 cycles of etoposide/cisplatin in
9511 versus 0124 (38% vs 29%). A more modest difference was seen in the cisplatin/irinotecan arm (29% vs
23%). When comparing the published DI data (9511 vs
0124), there was a numerical difference in the proportion of irinotecan (80.4% vs 66%) and cisplatin (95.3%
vs 78%) DI.

Efficacy
Common arm comparisons of efficacy endpoints including response rate, PFS, OS are summarized in Table 4 and
Figure 1. Ten patients (2 from Japan Clinical Oncology
Group and 8 from Southwest Oncology Group) were
excluded from the analysis of treatment response because
they did not receive treatment. Significant differences in
response rates were seen in the common arm comparisons
when evaluated in multivariate logistic regression models,
which enabled adjustment for age, sex, and performance
status. Specifically, for the etoposide/cisplatin arm,
response rates were 68% in 9511 and 57% in 0124 (P ¼
.02). For the cisplatin/irinotecan arm, response rates were
87% for the 9511 and 60% in 0124 (P<.001). In an
expanded logistic regression model that pooled the data
for both treatment arms, there was a significant arm by
trial interaction, indicating that the difference in response
between the Japanese and US patients is significantly
greater in the cisplatin/irinotecan arm patients. (P value
for interaction ¼ .03)

Comparative Outcomes Analysis in SCLC/Lara et al

There were no differences in PFS and OS for the
etoposide/cisplatin arm across trials. However, significant
differences were seen for OS for the cisplatin/irinotecan
arm. Specifically, median OS was 12.8 months for 9511
and 9.9 months for 0124 (P<.001, adjusted for age, sex,
and performance status via Cox proportional hazards
regression). Similarly, 1-year survival rates were 58% and
41%, respectively. The 1-month numerical difference in
PFS in the cisplatin/irinotecan arm was not statistically
significant. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of OS common
arm comparisons in the cisplatin/irinotecan arm are
shown in Figure 1. In a multivariate proportional hazards
regression model including trial (Japan vs United States)
treatment arm, age, sex, and performance status, the interaction between trial and treatment arm is significant, confirming that the survival difference by site (Japan vs
United States) depends on treatment arm (P value for
interaction term ¼ .01). A performance status of 0 (vs 1
or 2) was also independently prognostic for increased survival in multivariate modeling (P<.001). Age and sex
were not.

DISCUSSION
This common arm comparison of 9511 and 0124 using
pooled patient-level data provides unique insights into
potential reasons for the divergent results of these trials. In
addition, this analysis highlights the issue of whether in
the current era of clinical trials globalization, the results of
randomized oncology studies conducted outside the Unites States are directly translatable to North American populations.9 These issues obviously have regulatory
implications.
This analysis is unparalleled because 0124 was
designed a priori as a confirmatory trial for 9511, albeit
accruing from a different ethnic patient pool. The design
of the 0124 protocol was modeled directly on 9511,
including similar eligibility criteria and identical treatment dose schedules. The observed differences in demographics, toxicity, and efficacy outcomes between these
trials can be attributed to many factors, some of which
were previously discussed in the 0124 paper. With the
pooled multivariate analysis, we were able to investigate
(and rule out) the possibility that the different outcomes
between trials in the cisplatin/irinotecan arms were attributable to clear differences in patient populations with
respect to sex and performance status. Our analysis of
both survival and response showed that although performance status was prognostic for survival, the differences
between trials in the cisplatin/irinotecan arm persisted
even after adjusting for this imbalance.
Other potential factors included the smaller sample
size and/or the early stopping of 9511, which may have
overestimated the treatment effect.10
This common arm analysis demonstrates that the
principal difference in OS was seen only in the cisplatin/
irinotecan arms. The control etoposide/cisplatin arms in
both 0124 and 9511 had identical OS results. In the context of irinotecan-based therapy, 1 hypothesis that has
been posited is that there are inherent genetic differences
related to genes involved in irinotecan drug disposition

between patient populations. Although a preliminary
pharmacogenomic analysis of specimens from 0124
patients was performed to investigate some of these irinotecan-related genes, no specimens were available from the
older 9511 trial for similar pharmacogenomic investigations. Hence, no direct comparison of relevant genotypes
between trials is possible. However, insights on this issue
can be derived from prior common arm joint collaborations between Southwest Oncology Group and Japanese
investigators wherein patients with advanced nonsmall
cell lung cancer were enrolled in Southwest Oncology
Group and Japanese trials onto a common arm of paclitaxel and carboplatin.11 In that experience, genes relevant
to chemotherapy metabolism and transport were analyzed
in both American and Japanese populations. Significant
differences in toxicity, efficacy, and allelic distribution for
genes involved in paclitaxel disposition or DNA repair

5714

were observed between Japanese and US patients, supporting the hypothesis that pharmacogenomics may in
part be responsible for outcome divergence among patient
populations. This may also partly explain the toxicity differences seen between the Japanese and North American
populations, wherein Japanese patients apparently had
increased hematologic toxicity (neutropenia, leucopenia,
and anemia) in both treatment arms when compared with
North Americans.
In addition, there appears to be some differences in
the delivered DI in the cisplatin/irinotecan arms of both
trials (as reported in the published papers). Specifically,
more 9511 patients achieved a higher DI for both irinotecan and cisplatin as compared with 0124 patients.
Enhanced DI for 9511 patients may potentially explain
the differences in toxicity and efficacy between the trials.
A more detailed and expansive analysis of dose delivery
using individual patient data is required, but is beyond
the scope of this article. Finally, it must be noted that
other trials comparing similar chemotherapy regimens in
SCLC have previously been published.12,13 Some of us
(P.N.L., R.N., and D.R.G.) have previously discussed
these trials in the context of 0124 and 9511 in a recent
editorial.14 We refer readers to that editorial for additional
details.
In conclusion, etoposide/cisplatin remains the reference treatment standard in North America. In Japan, cisplatin/irinotecan remains a standard treatment option.
Significant differences in patient demographics, toxicity,
and efficacy exist between Japanese and North American
SCLC patients receiving identical treatment. These
results, relevant in the current era of clinical trials globalization, warrant 1) consideration of differential patient
characteristics and outcomes among patients receiving
identical therapy, 2) utilization of the common arm
model in prospective trials, and 3) inclusion of pharmacogenomic correlates in cancer trials where ethnic/racial differences in drug disposition are expected.
