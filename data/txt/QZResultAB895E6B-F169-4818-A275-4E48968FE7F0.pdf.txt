is known about the mechanisms mediating the positive fibroblast
response.
Although the physiologic role of TGF-h–mediated production of
myofibroblasts is to promote wound healing, under certain
circumstances, this program can become dysfunctional and lead
to fibrotic pathologies (7, 8). For instance, carcinomas originating
in various organs are well characterized to be associated with a
growth-promoting fibrotic (desmoplastic) reaction (9–12). Not
surprising, TGF-h has been shown to mediate fibrotic processes,
such as desmoplasia, in various contexts (11, 13–15). Interestingly,
carcinoma-associated fibroblasts exhibit similar in vitro characteristics as normal fibroblasts except they express higher levels of
TGF-h and possess a significantly increased ability to grow in soft
agar (16). Given the known role of TGF-h in promoting or
exacerbating fibrotic pathologies, it is necessary to further
elucidate the mechanisms whereby this cytokine promotes
fibroblast activation.
TGF-h initiates signal transduction by using two receptor
serine/threonine kinases referred to as the type I (ALK5) and
type II (ThR-II) receptors. TGF-h binding mediates the formation
of a heterotetrameric receptor complex whereby the constitutively active ThR-II phosphorylates the glycine-serine–rich region
in the juxtamembrane region of the dormant ALK5 leading to
kinase activation (17). Activated ALK5 directly phosphorylates the
receptor-regulated Smad proteins (R-Smads) on a COOH-terminal
SM/VS motif (18). In most cell types, TGF-h treatment leads to
phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which subsequently complex with the Co-Smad (Smad4) and accumulate in the nucleus
where they recognize Smad-binding elements (SBE; AGAC) and
collaborate with other transcription factors to regulate gene
expression (19).
Although it is clear that Smad proteins are critical TGF-h
effectors, distinct cellular phenotypes result, although the same
Smad proteins (Smad2 and Smad3) are activated. One potential
explanation for the variability in the cellular response to TGF-h is
the existence of cell type–specific signaling pathways. Consistent
with the ability of TGF-h to induce fibroblast proliferation, several
mitogenic targets, including PAK2, Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K), and c-Abl, have been identified, which are activated
by TGF-h in a subset of fibroblast but not epithelial lines (3, 5, 6, 20).
In addition, TGF-h has been shown to activate the serine/
threonine kinase Akt downstream of PI3K (3). However, the Akt
effectors that promote fibroblast activation in the context of TGF-h
signaling remain unclear. The current model of Akt activation
proposes that the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate by PI3K mediates membrane recruitment of Akt via its
pleckstrin homology domain. Akt is then regulated by two
phosphorylation events, which include the modification of T308
within the T loop of its catalytic domain by PDK1 and also S473
within its COOH-terminal hydrophobic motif (HM) by PDK2 (21).

Abstract
Transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) promotes a multitude
of diverse biological processes, including growth arrest of
epithelial cells and proliferation of fibroblasts. Although the
TGF-B signaling pathways that promote inhibition of epithelial cell growth are well characterized, less is known about the
mechanisms mediating the positive response to this growth
factor. Given that TGF-B has been shown to promote fibrotic
diseases and desmoplasia, identifying the fibroblast-specific
TGF-B signaling pathways is critical. Here, we investigate the
role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a known
effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and promoter
of cell growth, in the fibroblast response to TGF-B. We show
that TGF-B activates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in fibroblasts but not epithelial cells via a PI3K-Akt-TSC2–dependent
pathway. Rapamycin, the pharmacologic inhibitor of mTOR,
prevents TGF-B–mediated anchorage-independent growth
without affecting TGF-B transcriptional responses or extracellular matrix protein induction. In addition to mTORC1, we
also examined the role of mTORC2 in TGF-B action. mTORC2
promotes TGF-B–induced morphologic transformation and is
required for TGF-B–induced Akt S473 phosphorylation but not
mTORC1 activation. Interestingly, both mTOR complexes are
necessary for TGF-B–mediated growth in soft agar. These
results define distinct and overlapping roles for mTORC1 and
mTORC2 in the fibroblast response to TGF-B and suggest that
inhibitors of mTOR signaling may be useful in treating fibrotic
processes, such as desmoplasia. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):84–93]

Introduction
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) is a versatile cytokine
that regulates a variety of biological processes, including tissue
growth, differentiation, cell migration, angiogenesis, immunity,
and extracellular matrix (ECM) production among others (1). One
of the most intriguing aspects of TGF-h biology is the diversity of
cellular responses that can be induced depending on the cell type
and stimulation context (2). For instance, TGF-h has been shown
to suppress tumor formation while also promoting wound healing
via fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts,
spindle-shaped cells that are professional secretors of ECM
proteins (3–6). Although the TGF-h signaling pathways that
mediate epithelial cell growth arrest are well characterized, less

inhibits TGF-h–mediated anchorage-independent growth (AIG) of
fibroblasts without affecting TGF-h transcriptional responses or
ECM protein induction, (d) mTORC2 is required for TGF-h–
induced Akt S473 phosphorylation but not mTORC1 signaling, (e)
mTORC2 is uniquely required for TGF-h–mediated fibroblast
morphologic transformation, and ( f ) both mTORC1 and mTORC2
are required for TGF-h–mediated colony formation in soft agar.
These results define distinct as well as overlapping roles for
mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the fibroblast response to TGF-h and
suggest that inhibitors of mTOR signaling may be useful in treating
fibrotic processes, such as desmoplasia.

Despite the large number of Akt effectors, evidence from
Drosophila and murine studies suggests that the progrowth signals
mediated by Akt are primarily via activation of mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1; refs. 22, 23). mTOR is a serine/
threonine kinase that exists in two complexes referred to as
mTORC1 (mTOR, RAPTOR, mLST8, and PRAS40) and mTORC2
(mTOR, RICTOR, mLST8, mSIN1, and PROTOR; ref. 24). mTORC1, a
known promoter of cell growth, is controlled by a wide variety of
factors, including receptor tyrosine kinases, nutrients, and cellular
energy status (25). mTORC1 activity is induced by the small G
protein Rheb, which is negatively regulated by two tumor suppressors, TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin), encoded by the
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 genes (25). TSC1 and
TSC2 form a complex in which the GTPase-activating protein
domain of TSC2 promotes hydrolysis of Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP,
thereby inhibiting mTORC1 (26). Receptor tyrosine kinases have
been shown to promote the accumulation of GTP-bound Rheb via
inhibition of the TSC1/TSC2 complex by inducing the phosphorylation of TSC2 (24). Akt has been well documented to be one of
the kinases capable of directly phosphorylating and inactivating
TSC2 (27–29). Once activated, mTORC1 phosphorylates several
effectors, including S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E-binding protein 1, to promote translation initiation (25).
In contrast to mTORC1, the regulation and effectors of mTORC2
are less well understood. Recently, mTORC2 was shown to be the
elusive PDK2 responsible for phosphorylating Akt on S473 (30–32).
Modification of Akt by mTORC2, however, is not necessary for
kinase activation but is required for phosphorylation of certain
substrates, such as FoxO transcription factors (31, 32). In addition
to Akt, mTORC2 is required for phosphorylation of protein kinase
C a (PKCa) on S657 within its HM, a modification that promotes
PKCa stability (31–33). Finally, mTORC2 has been implicated in
regulating cytoskeletal dynamics via the activation of Rho GTPases
(33–35). Therefore, mTOR exists in two complexes that exhibit
functions associated with Akt signaling and are shown to promote
cell growth and cell shape changes.
Here, we investigate the role of mTOR signaling in the fibroblast
response to TGF-h and show that (a) TGF-h activates mTORC1 in
fibroblasts but not epithelial cells, (b) mTORC1 activation occurs
via a canonical PI3K-Akt-TSC2–dependent pathway, (c) rapamycin

Figure 2. TGF-h activates mTORC1 via a PI3K-Akt-TSC2–dependent pathway. A, AKR-2B cells were serum starved overnight followed by pretreatment with
vehicle (0.1% DMSO), LY294002 (10 Amol/L), UO126 (10 Amol/L), or rapamycin (10 nmol/L) for 30 min. Cells were left untreated ( ) or stimulated (+) with
TGF-h (5 ng/mL) for 4 h in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. Western blot analysis was performed as described in Materials and Methods. B, AKR-2B
fibroblasts were prepared as in A and stimulated with 5 ng/mL TGF-h for the indicated times. Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies to phosphorylated
(pTSC2 S939 and pAkt S473 ) or total TSC2 and Akt. C, TSC2 / MEFs were transfected with HA-S6K1 and TSC2 WT or TSC2 SATA. Cells were serum
starved overnight and subsequently stimulated with 5 ng/mL TGF-h for 4 h. HA-S6K1 was immunoprecipitated and assayed for phosphorylation (pS6K1 T389 )
or total expression (Anti-HA ). Western blot analysis was performed on total cell lysate for FLAG-TSC2, phospho-Smad2 (pSmad2 ), and total Smad2. D, AKR-2B
cells were serum starved overnight followed by pretreatment with vehicle (H2O) or cycloheximide (CHX ; 1.25 Ag/mL) for 30 min. Cells were subsequently stimulated
with TGF-h for 6 h. Western blot analysis performed as described in Materials and Methods.

Soft agar assay. To prevent cells from settling on the plate bottom and
adhering, bottom plugs (1 mL) containing 0.8% Sea Plaque-agarose (FMC
Bioproducts) and 10% FBS/DMEM were cast in 35-mm plates. Top plugs
(1 mL) were composed of 0.4% agarose, 10% FBS/DMEM, and 104 AKR-2B
cells in the presence or absence of 5 ng/mL TGF-h. As indicated, top plugs
contained vehicle or the pharmacologic inhibitor rapamycin. After 10 d at
37jC, the number of colonies >25 Am in diameter were counted by microscopy using a 1.0-cm grid. Ten grid regions were counted on each of three
plates. Quantization represents the average and SD of three independent
experiments each done in triplicate.
Transfections. All transfections were performed in 10% FBS/DMEM
using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). For
transfection of TSC2 / MEFs, cells were plated at 2  106 per 100-mm
tissue culture plates. The following day, cells were transfected with 5 Ag HAS6K1 and either 5 Ag FLAG-TSC2 wild-type (WT) or 5 Ag FLAG-TSC2 SATA.
After 4 h, the medium was changed to 10% FBS/DMEM and cells were
allowed to recover for 12 h. Constructs and conditions for the transfection
of AKR-2B and 293FT cells are described below.

EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 5 mmol/L

Equivalent total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was
transferred to either polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) or nitrocellulose
(Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with indicated antibodies following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Immunoprecipitations. Transfected TSC2 / MEFs were lysed as
described above. Approximately 500 Ag of lysate were incubated with 4 Ag
of anti-HA 12CA5 overnight at 4jC. Immune complexes were collected by
addition of 50 AL protein G-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h.
Sepharose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and subsequently
suspended in 50 AL 2 Laemmli buffer.
Morphologic transformation. AKR-2B cells were seeded at 2.5  106
in six-well tissue culture dishes, grown to confluence, and subsequently
serum starved by replacing medium with serum-free DMEM for 24 h.
The cells were then pretreated for 30 min with either ethanol (vehicle) or
10 nmol/L rapamycin and left untreated or stimulated with 5 ng/mL
TGF-h for 48 h.

Figure 4. mTORC2 is required for TGF-h–mediated Akt S473 phosphorylation but not mTORC1 signaling. A, mLST8+/ and mLST8 / MEFs were serum starved
overnight and either left untreated ( ) or stimulated (+) with 5 ng/mL TGF-h for 4 h. Western blots were performed with indicated phosphorylated and
corresponding total antibodies. B, stable AKR-2B cell lines expressing either nontargeting (NT), RAPTOR-targeting, or RICTOR-targeting shRNA were serum
starved overnight and either left untreated ( ) or stimulated (+) with 5 ng/mL TGF-h for 6 h and processed for Western blot analysis with indicated antibodies.

Luciferase assays. AKR-2B cells were plated in six-well plates at 2  105
per well. The next day, cells were transfected with 0.5 Ag of cytomegalovirush-galactosidase and either SBE-Luc (3.5 Ag), activin response element
(ARE)-Luc (2 Ag) + FAST-1 (2 Ag), fibronectin promoter-Luc (3.5 Ag), or
type I collagen promoter-Luc (3.5 Ag). After 4 h, media were changed to
DMEM-5% FBS, and the cells were allowed to recover for 12 h. Cells were
subsequently serum starved in 0.1% FBS/DMEM for 24 h. Before stimulation, cells were pretreated for 30 min with either ethanol or 10 nmol/L

Lentiviruses. pLKO.1-puro plasmids encoding short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) targeting raptor, RICTOR, and mTOR were obtained from the
Mayo Clinic Jacksonville RNA Interference Technology Resource. Lentivirus
packaging was performed using the ViraPower Lentiviral Expression System
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies). 293FT cells were cotransfected with pLKO.1puro shRNA and ViraPower DNA mix using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Twelve hours after transfection, medium was changed to
10% FBS/DMEM. Supernatants were collected 48 to 72 h after transfection.

alter its electrophoretic mobility, although phospho-Smad2 was
readily detected (Fig. 1A, right). To determine whether phosphorylation of S6K1 represents a cell type–specific response to TGF-h,
three representative fibroblast cell lines (AKR-2B, Swiss3T3, and
IMR-90) and three epithelial cell lines (Mv1Lu, HeLa, and MDCK)
were stimulated with TGF-h and the phosphorylation of S6K1 was
examined. As shown in Fig. 1B, although the degree of signal
induction varied, all three fibroblast cell lines exhibited robust
phosphorylation of S6K1 in response to TGF-h, whereas no detectable signal was observed from any of the epithelial cells.
TGF-B activates mTORC1 via a PI3K-Akt-TSC2–dependent
pathway. The current model of receptor tyrosine kinase–mediated
inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 involves inducing the phosphorylation of
TSC2 via either Akt or ERK-RSK (24). Given that TGF-h has been
shown to activate both PI3K-Akt and Ras-ERK activity in
fibroblasts (3, 20), we investigated whether either pathway(s) might
be necessary for TGF-h–mediated mTORC1 signaling. To address
this issue, serum-starved AKR-2B fibroblasts were pretreated with
various pharmacologic inhibitors and subsequently treated with
TGF-h. As shown in Fig. 2A, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished
the ability of TGF-h to induce phosphorylation of S6K1 to a similar
degree as rapamycin. However, the MEK inhibitor UO126 had no
effect despite completely preventing ERK phosphorylation.
Akt promotes mTORC1 activation via phosphorylation of TSC2
(28, 36). Given the previous pharmacologic data indicating PI3KAkt signaling as the primary mediator of TGF-h–dependent S6K1
phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), we investigated whether TGF-h induces
phosphorylation of TSC2. As shown in Fig. 2B, TGF-h promotes
Akt and TSC2 modification with similar kinetics. Although Fig. 2A
and B clearly implicates Akt in TGF-h–stimulated mTORC1 activity, to conclusively determine if Akt-mediated phosphorylation
of TSC2 is necessary for TGF-h–mediated mTORC1 activation, a

appearance of S6K1 phosphorylated on T389, a known mTORC1
site, was monitored. Phospho-S6K1 was observed after 2 hours of
treatment and remained detectable through 12 hours (Fig. 1A, left).
This increase in S6K1 T389 phosphorylation occurred in conjunction with a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of S6K1
(Fig. 1A, left). In addition, TGF-h stimulation induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 within 30 minutes (Fig. 1A, left). In contrast,

documented to morphologically transform into a myofibroblast
phenotype and undergo AIG following TGF-h treatment (3–5, 39).
To determine whether these responses are dependent on mTOR,
we used the pharmacologic agent rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of
mTORC1 that has also been reported to attenuate mTORC2 with
prolonged treatment, up to 24 hours (40). As shown in Fig. 3A,
rapamycin only modestly lessened TGF-h–mediated AKR-2B
morphologic transformation. However, rapamycin completely
prevented TGF-h–stimulated AIG with half maximal inhibition
occurring at subnanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3B and C).
To further assess the role of mTOR in TGF-h signaling, the effect of
rapamycin on the induction of various TGF-h–responsive promoters
was determined. Rapamycin did not inhibit the transcriptional
induction of ARE (Smad2 dependent), SBE (Smad3 dependent),
fibronectin, or type I collagen (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, consistent with
the transient reporter analyses, there was no detectable effect of
rapamycin on TGF-h–stimulated fibronectin or type I collagen
protein expression (Fig. 3D, right). These findings indicate that
although mTORC1 is critical for TGF-h AIG, it is not a general
regulator of TGF-h transcriptional or translational responses.
mTORC2 is required for TGF-h–mediated Akt S473 phosphorylation but not mTORC1 signaling. Although initial studies
suggested that mTORC1 is rapamycin sensitive, whereas mTORC2
is resistant to this pharmacologic agent, recent evidence indicates
that prolonged rapamycin treatment (24 hours) can also inhibit
mTORC2 (40). Given that our soft agar assay is performed over a
10-day period, this would preclude determining whether rapamycin
blocked cell growth due to inhibition of mTORC1, mTORC2, or
both. As such, to investigate the potential role of mTORC2 in
TGF-h action, we first investigated whether mTORC2 has a similar
role in TGF-h signaling as reported for receptor tyrosine kinases.

genetic approach was used. Although multiple Akt phosphorylation
sites exist on TSC2, S939 and T1462 are the predominantly
modified sites and are necessary for Akt-mediated inhibition of
TSC2 (28). Therefore, we transfected TSC2 / MEFs with constructs encoding HA-S6K1 and either WT TSC2 or TSC2 possessing
alanines at S939 and T1462 (SATA). TSC2 / MEFs transfected
with WT TSC2 exhibited TGF-h–mediated phosphorylation of HAS6K1, whereas cells transfected with the TSC2 SATA mutant failed
to induce HA-S6K1 phosphorylation (i.e., TGF-h signaling could
not inactivate the SATA mutant) despite displaying normal Smad2
phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). The results are consistent with the
model whereby TGF-h activates mTORC1 via the canonical PI3KAkt-TSC2–dependent pathway.
Interestingly, the kinetics of TGF-h–mediated PI3K-AktmTORC1 signaling is delayed compared with receptor tyrosine
kinases, which active this pathway within minutes of ligand
treatment. Although we have observed a weak early activation of
PI3K after TGF-h treatment that is independent of new protein
synthesis (data not shown; ref. 3), to investigate whether synthesis
of an intermediate factor(s) is required for this late signaling event,
we stimulated serum-starved AKR-2B cells with TGF-h in the
presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 2D, Akt phosphorylation on 6-hour TGF-h
treatment is completely inhibited by cycloheximide (Fig. 2D).
Unfortunately, we were unable to examine the activation of
mTORC1 in this experiment because both transcriptional and
translational inhibitors alone promote S6K1 phosphorylation (data
not shown; refs. 37, 38).
Rapamycin inhibits TGF-B–mediated AIG of AKR-2B cells.
We next investigated whether mTOR plays a role in the fibroblast
biological response to TGF-h. Several fibroblast cell lines have been

transduction, seeded in soft agar with (white columns ) or without (black columns ) 5 ng/mL TGF-h. Quantitation of colony formation after 10 d of growth is shown.

mTOR, suggesting that long-term reduction in mTOR expression is
incompatible with AKR-2B cell viability. In Fig. 4B, it is shown that
knockdown of RAPTOR inhibits TGF-h–mediated phosphorylation
of S6K1 without affecting phosphorylation of Akt S473 or TSC2. In
agreement with the results using the mLST8-null MEFs (Fig. 4A),
RICTOR knockdown diminishes Akt S473 phosphorylation without
significantly affecting phosphorylation of TSC2 or S6K1 (Fig. 4B).
mTORC1 and mTORC2 provide distinct and overlapping
actions in the fibroblast response to TGF-B. Given that mTORC2
has been implicated in cytoskeletal dynamics (33, 34), and TGF-h
morphologic transformation is associated with changes in cytoarchitecture (4), we further investigated the role of mTORC2 in
TGF-h–mediated fibroblast morphologic transformation. As shown
in Fig. 5A and consistent with the results of Fig. 3A using rapamycin, expression of control or RAPTOR-targeting shRNA in AKR2B fibroblasts has no affect on the morphologic changes induced
by TGF-h. However, fibroblasts expressing a RICTOR-targeting
shRNA exhibit a significant attenuation in TGF-h–mediated

Previous reports have shown that mTORC2 is required for
phosphorylation of Akt on S473 within its COOH terminus but is
not required for Akt T308 phosphorylation (30–32). Of note,
although Akt S473 phosphorylation seems to be required for a
subset of Akt substrates, many (including TSC2) can still be
phosphorylated in the absence of S473 phosphorylation (31, 32). To
address the role of mTORC2 in the context of profibrotic TGF-h
signaling, we used MEFs deficient in mLST8, a component of both
mTOR complexes that is required for mTORC2 function but not
mTORC1 (32). As shown in Fig. 4A and consistent with that
observed for receptor tyrosine kinases, whereas mLST8 / MEFs
fail to induce phosphorylation of Akt S473 in response to TGF-h,
Akt T308 phosphorylation as well as TSC2 and S6K1 signaling
remain intact.
To further delineate the roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the
fibroblast response to TGF-h, we created stable AKR-2B cell lines
expressing shRNAs targeting RAPTOR and RICTOR. We were
unable to isolate a stable cell clone with efficient knockdown of

pronounced effect occurred in the RICTOR knockdown cells, which
show a reduction in both the basal and TGF-h–stimulated activity
of the ECM promoters relative to control cells (Fig. 6C). However,
the fold induction in the RICTOR knockdown cells was comparable
with control cells (see Fig. 6 legend), suggesting that although
mTORC2 is necessary for efficient activity of a basal regulatory
element, it plays no significant role in regulating TGF-h–mediated
induction of the type I collagen and fibronectin promoters.
Although the mechanisms regulating this effect are unknown,
these findings indicate multiple roles for mTOR complexes in
regulating profibrotic signaling.

formation of spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 5A). Thus, mTORC2 might
be involved in TGF-h–mediated morphologic changes that are
insensitive to rapamycin.
The finding that rapamycin does not affect TGF-h–mediated
morphologic transformation (Fig. 3A), whereas RICTOR knockdown attenuates this process (Fig. 5A), suggests that mTORC2
is not significantly inhibited by rapamycin in AKR-2B cells. To
investigate the sensitivity of mTORC2 in AKR-2B cells to rapamycin, we treated serum-starved AKR-2B cells with vehicle or
rapamycin for 24 hours before TGF-h stimulation. As shown in
Fig. 5B, prolonged rapamycin treatment did not attenuate TGFh–mediated Akt S473 phosphorylation, although it completely
inhibited S6K1 T389 phosphorylation. Although this might seem
to differ from the study by Sarbassov and colleagues (40), those
investigators also reported that the sensitivity of mTORC2 to
prolonged (24 hours) rapamycin treatment varied considerably
among different cell lines with some exhibiting nearly complete
loss of Akt S473 phosphorylation in the presence of 10% serum,
whereas others showed no attenuation. As such, to further define
the sensitivity of mTORC2 in fibroblasts, AKR-2B, Swiss3T3, and
IMR-90 fibroblasts were treated with either ethanol or rapamycin
in the presence of 10% serum for 24 hours. Figure 5C shows that
although rapamycin completely abrogates S6K1 phosphorylation,
it has no affect on the phosphorylation of Akt S473. These results
indicate that mTORC2 expressed in a subset of human and murine
fibroblast lines is rapamycin insensitive, as has been described for
other cell types (40).
Next, we investigated the role of both mTOR complexes in
TGF-h–mediated AIG. Given that cells can exhibit variability in
the extent of growth in soft agar, we performed transient transduction with lentiviruses expressing shRNA molecules to avoid
differences in growth due to clonal selection. Figure 6A shows
that shRNA-expressing lentiviruses were effective at reducing
the expression of RAPTOR, RICTOR, and mTOR without influencing the expression of other mTOR complex components. These
AKR-2B cultures were then used to determine the ability of
TGF-h to induce soft agar colony formation. Interestingly, knockdown of either RAPTOR, RICTOR, or mTOR significantly inhibited
the ability of TGF-h to induce AIG (Fig. 6B). As only mTORC2
was required for TGF-h morphologic transformation (Figs. 3A
and 5A), these results suggest a dual role for mTOR in the fibroblast response to TGF-h with both mTORC1 and mTORC2 having
distinct but critical actions.
The role of mTOR complexes in TGF-B transcriptional
responses. The inability of long-term rapamycin treatment to
inhibit mTORC2 activity in AKR-2B cells suggests that experiments
using rapamycin to investigate TGF-h–dependent transcription
(Fig. 3D) are only addressing the role of mTORC1. To more
conclusively determine the effect of mTORC2 in these transcriptional responses, we used AKR-2B cell lines stably expressing
RAPTOR- and RICTOR-targeting shRNAs. As shown in Fig. 6C,
neither RAPTOR nor RICTOR knockdown had any overt effect on
TGF-h–mediated induction of the ARE (Smad2 dependent) or SBE
promoters (Smad3 dependent). Although statistical analysis indicates a slight attenuation of ARE activity in the RICTOR knockdown cells, it is unclear whether it is biologically significant.
Interestingly, as opposed to the results using rapamycin (Fig. 3D),
RAPTOR knockdown cells exhibit a modest decrease in TGFh–mediated fibronectin and type I collagen promoter activity
(Fig. 6C). These results suggest distinct effects of long-term versus
acute pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1. Interestingly, the most

Discussion
Given its known role in fibrotic diseases and desmoplasia, we
have focused on defining the targets through which TGF-h
stimulates fibroblast activation. To that end, several fibroblastspecific non-Smad signaling pathways have been identified
regulating this response (3, 5, 39). Currently, the most upstream
effector is PI3K, which independently leads to the activation of
PAK2 and Akt (3, 5). Of note, another TGF-h effector activated by
PAK2 in a subset of fibroblast, not epithelial, cell lines is the c-Abl
nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (39). Not only does this finding tie
tyrosine kinase activity to a plasma membrane receptor serine/
threonine kinase cascade, the c-Abl inhibitor imatinib meslylate/
Gleevec prevents TGF-h–mediated fibroblast proliferation in vitro
and attenuates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and ureter
obstruction-induced kidney fibrosis (41, 42). These in vitro and
animal model studies have led to a phase II clinical trial examining
the efficacy of imatinib versus placebo in the treatment of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.3
Although identifying c-Abl as a PAK2 effector shed new insight
into the TGF-h signaling network, the role of Akt remained unclear.
As such, in this study, we focused on identifying targets
downstream of Akt required for TGF-h–mediated fibroblast
proliferation. These results show that the serine/threonine kinase
mTOR is a critical effector of profibrotic TGF-h signaling (Figs. 1, 3,
5, and 6). The lack of inducible phosphorylation of the mTORC1
substrate S6K1 in epithelial cells is consistent with previous data
showing that TGF-h fails to activate Akt in epithelia (3). Whereas
we do not detect mTORC1 activation following TGF-h treatment of
epithelial cultures (Fig. 1), another study showed that NMuMg and
HaCaT epithelial cells, which undergo epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in response to TGF-h, do induce S6K1
phosphorylation on TGF-h signaling (43). Although these results
would seem to be at odds with our data showing a fibroblast
tropism to mTORC1 activation (Fig. 1), we find a similar increase in
mTORC1 activity when NMuMg cells are treated with TGF-h (data
not shown), supporting the hypothesis that TGF-h can activate
mTORC1 in those few epithelia that possess the ability to gain a
mesenchymal phenotype. However, it should be noted that TGF-h–
mediated activation of mTORC1 in this small subset of epithelial
cells does precede conversion to a mesenchymal phenotype (43).
The mechanism(s) whereby some epithelial cultures respond to
TGF-h by activating mTORC1 clearly requires further investigation.
In that regard, it seems that the ability of TGF-h to activate PI3K
represents a critical node as it is an upstream target required for

(Figs. 3B and C, 5A, and 6B) is promising given that there are
clinically approved mTOR inhibitors and TGF-h is known to
promote fibrotic diseases and desmoplasia (11, 13–15). Furthermore, because rapamycin has been shown to possess anticancer
and antiangiogenic properties (44, 45), these agents could target
malignant cell growth as well as the associated reactive stromal
response. In addition, because mTOR represents a cell type–
restricted response to TGF-h (Fig. 1), it would not alter other
critical functions of this growth factor.
Although a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the signaling pathways activated by TGF-h, many
questions remain how this single cytokine regulates such a plethora
of biological responses. Elucidating these mechanisms will not
only shed light on fundamental biological processes but also
provide potential opportunities to modulate aberrant responses
contributing to several human pathologies.

mTORC1 activity in both fibroblasts and EMT-responsive epithelial
cells (Fig. 2; refs. 3, 43).
Along with showing that mTOR is a critical TGF-h effector in
fibroblasts, our results distinguish unique as well as overlapping
activities for mTORC1 and mTORC2. As such, this suggests several
areas for future investigations. First, although TGF-h uses the same
PI3K-Akt-TSC2 pathway to activate mTORC1 as receptor tyrosine
kinases, PI3K activation by TGF-h is more complex than previously
appreciated. Whereas the early response is independent of new
protein synthesis (3), the robust late activation is prevented by
cycloheximide (Fig. 2D). This observation suggests that TGF-h may
be inducing this pathway via both direct and indirect mechanisms.
We are currently investigating the mechanism and intermediate
factor(s) by which TGF-h is coupled to the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1
pathway. Second, it is unclear how mTORC1 is promoting TGF-h–
mediated AIG because rapamycin does not influence Smad transcriptional responses or induction of ECM components (Fig. 3D).
Given the known role of mTORC1 in regulating translation, rapamycin may be preventing the translation of critical TGF-h effectors.
Third, it is currently unclear how mTORC2 may be regulating the
basal activity of the fibronectin and type I collagen promoters.
Finally, the mTORC2 targets required for TGF-h–mediated
morphologic transformation and AIG are currently unknown.
It will be interestingly to determine if known downstream
mTORC2 mediators such as Akt, PKCa, and/or P-Rex1 are involved
(30–33, 35). Future studies will hopefully elucidate additional
potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
