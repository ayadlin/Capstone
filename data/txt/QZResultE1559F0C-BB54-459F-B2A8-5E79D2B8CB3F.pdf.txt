ABSTRACT
Curcumin, a natural polyphenol compound from the perennial herb Curcuma
longa, has been proved to be beneficial for tumor-bearing animals through inhibiting
tumor neovasculature formation, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we
aim to test whether curcumin affects VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling pathway and attenuates
defective hematopoiesis induced by VEGF in tumor model. We demonstrated that
curcumin inhibited proliferation, migration of HUVEC under VEGF stimulation and
caused HUVEC apoptosis, and blocked VEGFR2 activation and its downstream signaling
pathways in vitro. Furthermore, in VEGF over-expressing tumor model, curcumin
significantly inhibited the tumor growth accelerated by VEGF in a dose-dependent
manner and improved anemia and extramedullary hematopoiesis in livers and spleens
of tumor-bearing mice induced by tumor-derived VEGF. Immunohistochemical analysis
showed that curcumin normalized vasculature structures of livers and reduced tumor
microvessel density. ELISA revealed that curcumin suppressed VEGF secretion
from tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Survival analysis showed that curcumin
significantly improved survival ability of VEGF tumor-bearing mice. Taken together,
these findings establish curcumin as a modulator of VEGF and VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling
pathway, with potential implication for improving the quality of life of cancer patients.

cell migration, proliferation, survival, and enhanced vascular
permeability [3–5]. The tumor growth in vivo requires new
vessels to provide nutrition and oxygen, thus, the tumor
cells recruit proangiogenic cytokines to induce tumor
angiogenesis, and VEGF, mainly secreted from tumors,
has been demonstrated to be the critical proangiogenic
stimulator in neovascularization during the process of
tumor development [6–10]. The tumor vasculature is an
increasingly attractive target for development of anticancer
drugs [11] and antiangiogenic drugs in combination with
chemotherapy improve survival in patients with certain types

INTRODUCTION
VEGF, as a mitogen and survival factor for vascular
endothelial cells, is a crucial regulator of vascular
development during embryogenesis as well as bloodvessel formation in the adult [1]. VEGF acts through two
high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR1/flt-1
and VEGFR2/KDR/flk-1, both are expressed on normal
vascular endothelial cells [2]. VEGFR2 is considered to be
the predominant mediator of VEGF-stimulated endothelial

of cancers [12]. Tumor-derived angiogenic factors act locally
to promote tumor angiogenesis, but they may also enter the
circulation and have an effect on the healthy vasculature [13].
VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling system is essentially required for
maintenance of a subset of vasculatures in healthy tissues and
organs [14–15]. When optimal expression levels are altered,
VEGF often causes pathological disorders by triggering
uncontrolled vascular responses that include pathological
vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and tissue edema [16].
Curcumin, a natural polyphenol from turmeric,
which presents strong anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory
and anti-septic properties, has been used for centuries
to treat inflammation, tumor and other diseases [17].
Accumulating evidences suggest that curcumin shows its
anti-tumor activity by modulating various targets either
through direct interaction or through modulation of gene
expression [18–19]. Curcumin has been demonstrated to
possess direct antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo
[20–23]. Curcumin inhibits VEGF-mediated angiogenesis
in human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells
through COX-2 and MAPK inhibition [24]. Curcumin
down-regulates gene expression of VEGF, angiopoietin 1
and 2 in tumor cells and suppresses VEGFR2 expression
in HUVEC [25–26]. In addition, curcumin has been found
to inhibit VEGF production from various tumor cells
though down-regulation of HIF1-α expression [27–28].
Based on the above considerations, the purpose of
this present study was to investigate the effect of curcumin
on VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling pathway and pathological
disorders induced by VEGF. To test this, effect of curcumin
was evaluated in vitro and in VEGF tumor model. Our
results showed that curcumin inhibited VEGF induced
HUVEC proliferation and migration and caused apoptosis
of HUVEC. And curcumin blocked VEGFR2 mediated
signaling pathways through suppressing phosphorylation
of VEGFR2 induced by VEGF. Furthermore, curcumin
inhibited tumor growth accelerated by VEGF and
improved several pathological changes including anemia,
hepatosplenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis
in livers and spleens of tumor-bearing mice induced by
VEGF in tumor model. In addition, curcumin reduced
circulating VEGF and prolonged survival times of tumorbearing mice. Taken together, our data identify curcumin
as a blocker of VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling pathways and
suggest that curcumin-based therapy has the possibility to
improve quality of life and lifespan of cancer patients.

In order to evaluate the effect of curcumin on VEGFVEGFR signaling pathway in vitro, cell viability and
migration assays of HUVEC under VEGF stimulation were
conducted, our results showed that VEGF significantly
stimulated HUVEC proliferation and curcumin efficiently
inhibited VEGF induced HUVEC proliferation (Figure 1A).
Wound healing assay revealed that migration of HUVEC
stimulated by VEGF was significantly suppressed by
curcumin without loss of cell viability (Figure 1B, 1C).
These results give us the convincing evidence that curcumin
affects the signaling pathways of VEGF, resulting in
inhibition of proliferation and migration.
Results of HUVEC proliferation assay also
indicated that curcumin not only inhibited endothelial cells
proliferation, but also caused cells step into death. In order
to clarify apoptosis or necrosis, we conducted Annexin
V-FITC/PI assay and the results determined by flow
cytometry showed that percent of apoptosis cells of HUVEC
was increased apparently after treatment with curcumin
(Figure 1D), indicating that curcumin has the ability to
induce apoptosis of HUVEC. And it was further confirmed
by determination of caspase 3/7 activities. The caspase 3/7
activities of HUVEC were significantly increased after
treatment with 20 μM Curcumin for 12 hours or 24 hours
(Figure 1E, 1F). Western blot analysis of HUVEC after
treatment with curcumin showed caspase-3 and PARP were
obviously cleaved to active caspase-3 and PARP fragments
(Figure 1G), which demonstrates that curcumin induces
HUVEC apoptosis through activating activities of caspase-3.

Curcumin inhibited activation of VEGFR2
induced by VEGF and blocked VEGFR2
mediated signaling pathways
As we know, VEGF stimulates endothelial cells
proliferation, migration and differentiation through
activating VEGF receptors mediated signaling pathways,
and VEGFR2 mediated signaling pathways play a key role
in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and vasculogenesis
[30–31]. It was reasonable for us to investigate the effect
of curcumin on activation of VEGFR2 and its downstream
signaling pathways. Porcine aortic endothelial cell line
over-expressing human VEGFR2 (PAE-KDR) was used
to evaluate the effect of curcumin on phosphorylation of
VEGFR2 (KDR), and the results showed that curcumin
obviously suppressed phosphorylation of VEGFR2
(Figure 1H), which indicates that curcumin can inhibit
the activation of VEGFR2 and block VEGFR2 mediated
signaling pathways, and it was confirmed by western blot
analysis for HUVEC. After treated with curcumin for 24
hours, phosphorylation of Akt and Erk were observed to be
decreased apparently (Figure 1G), since Erk and Akt are
key downstream factors of VEGFR2-mediated signaling
pathways correlated to proliferation and survival of
HUVEC respectively, we confirmed that curcumin blocked
VEGFR2 mediated downstream signaling pathways.

RESULTS
Curcumin inhibited VEGF induced HUVEC
proliferation and migration in vitro and caused
apoptosis of HUVEC
Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)
plays a key role in vascular sprout and growth and often
be used to evaluate anti-angiogenesis activity in vitro [29].

In addition, RT-PCR analysis of HUVEC after treated
with curcumin for 24 hours showed that expression of
VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were decreased obviously, while
the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF did not change (data

and migration of endothelial cells through suppressing
activation and expression of VEGF receptors and blocking
VEGF receptors mediated signaling pathways.

xenograft mouse model, we observed that the mouse
fibrosarcoma tumor grew significantly faster in the T241VEGF tumor-bearing mice than that of the T241-vector
tumor model (Figure 2A), which confirms the viewpoint
that VEGF accelerates tumor growth in vivo [30]. The in
vitro cell viability assay showed that curcumin significantly
inhibited the proliferation of T241-VEGF, and the IC50
was 31.97 μM (Figure 2B). In vivo, curcumin significantly
suppressed the tumor growth in T241-VEGF tumorbearing mice compared with vehicle control in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 2C). The tumor weights of the
treated groups were decreased significantly (Figure 2D).
In contrast, no significant difference of body weights was
observed between different groups (Figure  2E), which
demonstrates curcumin has the potential against the tumor
growth under VEGF stimulation and shows no toxicity to
tumor-bearing mice.

curcumin possesses the same potency as anti-VEGF and
anti-VEGFR2 therapy, evidencing that curcumin blocks
the function of VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling pathways.

Tumor-derived VEGF induces depletion of
hematopoietic cells from bone marrow and results in an
anemic symptom in VEGF tumor-bearing mice, and it can
be reversed by anti-VEGF or anti-VEGFR2 therapy [32–
33]. In our mouse model, we also observed that tumorbearing mice exhibited severe anemia. Hematological
analysis of peripheral blood showed a significant decrease
in red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit in T241VEGF tumor-bearing mice compared with that of normal
mice. However, curcumin significantly improved this
defective hematopoiesis. The red blood cells, hemoglobin,

significantly increased compared with that of vehicle

mice were significantly different with that of normal
mice, the coefficients of livers and spleens of tumorbearing mice were significantly increased, while liver
coefficients and spleen coefficients of curcumin treated
groups were significantly decreased, especially for mice
treated with high dose of curcumin (Figure 3E, 3F), which
suggests that curcumin inhibited hematopoiesis in livers

and spleens of tumor-bearing mice induced by tumorderived VEGF with a dose dependent manner. And it was
confirmed by results of histological examination of liver
sections and spleen sections. Histological examination
of liver sections showed that visible hematopoietic islets
were observed in liver sections of VEGF tumor-bearing
mice but not in liver sections of normal mice (Figure 4A),
which was consistent with previous study [16]. And

no hematopoietic islets were found in liver sections of

inhibited hematopoiesis in liver tissues of tumor-bearing
mice. In addition, histological examination of spleen

VEGF tumor-bearing mice compared with that of normal

spleens of tumor-bearing mice from this pathological
change. Since active hematopoiesis occurs in red pulp of
spleen [16], we confirmed curcumin ameliorates spleen
hematopoiesis induced by tumor-derived VEGF. Together
of all, these findings demonstrate that curcumin is an

to tumor-bearing mice by improving pathological changes
induced by tumor-derived VEGF.

Curcumin normalized liver vascular structures
and decreased tumor microvessel density in
tumor-bearing mice

Curcumin, which is a small molecular weight
component of turmeric, has been studied for its wideranging effects on tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis,
and signal transduction pathways [35–36]. Previous
studies show that curcumin inhibits angiogenesis through
inhibiting VEGF production from tumor cells [23, 27–28,
37] and down-regulating expression of VEGF receptors
in endothelial cells [25]. In VEGF-activated human
intestinal microvascular endothelial cells, curcumin
inhibits expression of COX-2 and blocks MAPK
signaling pathway [24]. Curcumin is also found to inhibit
the binding of PDGF and PDGFR and reduce PDGFstimulated phosphorylation of PDGFR [38]. However,
few insights have been put on VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling
pathway. Here, we reported, for the first time, that
curcumin inhibited VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of
VEGFR2, which is necessary for activation of VEGFR2
during the process of HUVEC proliferation, migration and
differentiation. Decrease of phosphorylation of Erk and
Akt indicates that curcumin inhibited VEGFR2 mediated
MAPK/Erk and PI3K-Akt pathway in endothelial cells,
the former is consistent with previous study [24]. Based
on these results, we confirm that curcumin can target
VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling pathway and block functions
mediated by VEGF. And inhibition on proliferation and
migration of HUVEC induced by VEGF support our
conclusion.
Apoptosis of endothelial cells plays a key role in
periodic remodeling of the vasculature and in the timely
evolution and regression of angiogenic response [39]. We
observed that curcumin induced apoptosis of HUVEC
through activating caspase-3, and it was consistent
with previous studies [25]. These findings indicate that
curcumin has the possibility to remodel or normalize the
abnormal vasculature, and it can be indirectly confirmed
by normalization of dilated sinusoidal vessels in livers of
tumor-bearing mice after curcumin treatment.
Curcumin inhibits different types of tumor growth
through selectively modulating multiple cell signaling
pathways linked to inflammation and to survival, growth,
invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis of cancer cells [18].
In our VEGF tumor model, VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling
pathway plays the primary role in accelerating the tumor
growth through stimulating tumor angiogenesis. However,
curcumin was observed to suppress tumor size and
growth in this VEGF over-expressing tumor model, and
circulating VEGF and tumor microvessel density were
significantly reduced after curcumin treatment. These
findings reinforce that curcumin inhibits tumor growth
and vasculogenesis in vivo through interrupting VEGFVEGFR2 signaling pathways.

DISCUSSION

In order to further validate the mechanism of
curcumin on liver hematopoiesis, immunohistochemical
analysis was conducted for liver sections and highly dilated
sinusoidal hepatic vasculatures were observed in livers
of VEGF tumor-bearing mice but not in livers of normal
mice, while curcumin obviously reduced vessel dilation
and normalized vascular architecture of livers in VEGF
tumor-bearing mice (Figure 5A). Since VEGF is known to
significantly induce pathological angiogenesis, tortuosity
of tumor vasculatures and vasculogenesis in tumors,
the effect of curcumin on VEGF tumor angiogenesis
was investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis of
tumor sections showed that curcumin significantly
decreased tumor microvessel density compared to that
of the untreated group (Figure 5B, 5C), which indicated
curcumin could inhibit tumor angiogenesis stimulated
by tumor-derived VEGF. These findings confirm that
curcumin inhibits vascular tortuosity and vasculogenesis
in tumor and various organs induced by VEGF.

Curcumin inhibited VEGF production from
tumor cells and improved survival ability of
tumor-bearing mice
Circulating VEGF levels are correlated with
severity of cancer associated systemic syndrome (CASS)
in preclinical animal models and human cancer patients,
high level of VEGF in circulation means more severe
pathological disorders [32]. Curcumin improves anemia
and extramedullary hematopoiesis induced by tumorderived VEGF, as tumor secretes VEGF into circulation,
we speculated that circulating VEGF of treated mice
should be reduced, and it was confirmed by determination
of plasma VEGF of tumor-bearing mice. Circulating
VEGF of curcumin treated groups was significantly
decreased compared with that of control group (Figure
6A). In addition, curcumin was observed to significantly
suppress VEGF secretion from T241-VEGF in vitro
when cell viabilities of T241-VEGF were maintained
(Figure 6B, 6C), indicating that curcumin interrupts
VEGF production from tumor cells, which was consistent
with previous studies [27–28]. Survival time of tumorbearing animals is impaired by cancer associated systemic
syndrome [32, 34]. However, in this VEGF tumor model,
curcumin significantly prolonged survival time of tumorbearing mice compared with vehicle control (Figure 6D),
which indicates that curcumin confers survival advantage

VEGF induced cancer associated systemic syndrome
(CASS), including defective hematopoiesis, endocrine
system, ascites, GI track disorders, muscular and adipose
atrophy, and functional impairment of liver, spleen, and
kidney in tumor-bearing animals and cancer patients,
which impairs quality of life and shortens the lifespan
[32]. VEGFR2 mediated signaling is crucial for causing
the systemic damage of multiple tissues and organs [32–
33]. Anti-VEGF or anti-VEGFR2 therapy significantly
improves pathological changes induced by tumor-derived
VEGF and confers survival advantages to tumor-bearing
mice or cancer patients [14, 32, 40–41]. As a regulator of
VEGF and its downstream signaling pathways, curcumin
has the potential to improve paraneoplastic syndromes
caused by tumor-derived VEGF. Our present study found
that curcumin significantly improved severe anemia and
extramedullary hematopoiesis in livers and spleens of
tumor-bearing mice induced by tumor-derived VEGF and
prolonged survival time of tumor-bearing mice, which
provides the robust evidences that curcumin has the ability
to improve quality of life of tumor-bearing mice through
inhibiting VEGF mediated angiogenesis. Interestingly, low
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dose of curcumin used in this study showed no significant
effect on tumor growth inhibition, but significantly
improved anemia and extramedullary hematopoiesis
in livers and spleens of tumor-bearing mice induced by
VEGF, which indicates that curcumin does not always
inhibit tumor size and growth, but still can benefit tumorbearing mice through inducing systemic alterations of the
vasculature that modulate the function of various tissues
and organs in tumor-bearing mice.
Chemotherapy, considered as the first line
regimen for cancer therapy in clinical, displays broad
adverse effects [42]. Tumor-derived VEGF is found
to increase chemotoxicity and chemotherapy-induced
mortality through synergistically suppressing bone
marrow hematopoiesis with chemotherapeutic drugs,
antiangiogenic agents improve survival in tumor-bearing
mice by increasing tolerance to chemotherapy-induced
toxicity [34]. Curcumin, as a blocker of VEGF-VEGFR2
signaling pathway, improves defective hematopoiesis
induced by VEGF, which indicates that curcumin has the
possibility to decrease chemotherapy-induced toxicity.
Since curcumin in combination with chemotherapeutic
19477

VEGF stimulated HUVEC proliferation assay

agents shows synergistic effect on tumor inhibition [43–
44], we suppose that curcumin-based therapies may have
great potential in cancer treatment. Further preclinical and
clinical studies are necessary to confirm our hypothesis.
Various animal models or human studies have
proved that curcumin is extremely safe even at very high
doses [45–47]. A daily oral dose of 3.6 g of curcumin
shows no toxicity in human and is advocated for phase
II evaluation in the prevention or treatment of cancers
[48]. In spite of its efficacy and safety, curcumin has not
yet been approved as a therapeutic agent due to its poor
bioavailability, some of possible ways including adjuvants,
nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, phospholipid
complexes, derivatives and analogues are explored to
overcome this problem [49]. Intraperitoneal administration
is used in this study due to the poor bioavailability of
curcumin, but the dose of curcumin used in this study
is lower than human tolerant dose, and no difference
of bodyweights between treated mice and normal mice
confirms the safety of curcumin in our study.
According to our study, curcumin inhibits tumor
growth, tumor angiogenesis and induces apoptosis of
endothelial cells, and suppresses HIF-1 mediated VEGF
production and VEGF mediated signaling pathways. The
complicated mechanism of anti-angiogenesis of curcumin
can be explained by the action-reaction model described
previously [50]. In this model, curcumin simultaneously
plays the action role and anti-reaction role, which means
that curcumin not only inhibits tumor angiogenesis, but
also suppresses the production of VEGF in response to
hypoxia induced by inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.
Together all, our findings provide a novel mechanistic
insight to explain the benefit of curcumin in preclinical and
clinical studies and suggest that combinatorial therapy
of curcumin with other drugs to improve pathological
disorders caused by tumor-derived VEGF or chemotherapy
will produce incredible benefits for cancer patients.

sc-166574) and H3 (Sunshine Biotechnology, China;
SAP5616) were served as reference control. Erk (9102),
phospho-Erk (9101), Akt (9272), phospho-Akt (9271),
FAK (3285), phospho-FAK (3283), PARP (9542) and
Caspase-3 (9662) antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology.

Measurement of human VEGF

Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 was investigated
according to previously described [52]. Briefly, PAEKDR cells were grown to 70–80% confluency in 6 well
plates, starved for 16 hours in serum-free DMEM, and
treated with various doses of curcumin for 8 hours, and
stimulated with 100 ng/mL VEGF for 15 minutes. Cells
were washed once with cold PBS and lysed on ice in 200
μL RIPA lysis solution supplemented with 1mM PMSF.
Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and
blocked overnight in 1% BSA in PBST, then incubated
with a primary monoclonal mouse antibody against
phosphotyrosine (Millipore; 05–321). Proteins were
visualized using goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
conjugated to HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 715–035150) and ECL detection system.

The 96 well strip plate was coated with rabbit
anti human VEGF monoclonal antibody (provided
by Epitomics, Hangzhou, China) and incubated at
4oC overnight, blocked with blocking buffer (10 mM
phosphate-buffer containing 1% BSA) at 25oC for 60
minutes, and then washed twice with washing buffer
(10 mM phosphate-buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20),
added 100 μL of recombinant human VEGF (R&D
systems; 293-VE-50), negative control or samples and
incubated at 25oC for 2 hours. Washed three times with
washing buffer and incubated with avastin labeled with
biotin (provided by Simcere, China) at 25oC for 60
minutes, added streptavidin coupled with horse radish
peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 016–030-084)
to each well after three washes and incubated for 60
minutes at 25oC, then washed three times and added
100 μL 1-step ultra TMB-ELISA (Thermo Scientific;
34028) to each well, incubated for 15 minutes at
room temperature and stopped with 50 μL 1M H2SO4.
Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with microplate
reader (Sunrise, TECAN, Swiss).

VEGF over-expressing tumor-bearing mice
model

Histological studies and Immunohistochemical
examination

Animal model was constructed as described
previously [16, 32]. Briefly, 1 × 106 tumor cells were
subcutaneously implanted on the back of female 6–8
week-old C57BL/6 mice. The T241-VEGF tumor-bearing
mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8–10/
group): Control group, Curcumin (L) group, Curcumin
(M) group and Curcumin (H) group. Various doses of
curcumin were used for treatment according to previous
studies [25–26]. Curcumin was dissolved in DMSO to a
final concentration of 1 M and diluted with 20% Tween
80 in PBS. Curcumin (L) group, Curcumin (M) group
and Curcumin (H) group were administered with 2.5 mM,
5  mM and 10 mM of curcumin solution, respectively
(100 μL per mouse, i.p. (intraperitoneal injection), daily).
Control group was treated with vehicle (20% Tween 80
in PBS, i.p., daily). All treatments started 24 hours after
tumor cells inoculation and continued for 2 weeks. Tumor
volumes were measured every other day and all mice
were sacrificed at day 15, blood and tissues / organs were
collected for further analysis.

Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned in 4 μm
thickness and stained with hematoxylin-eosn (H&E)
according to previously described methods [16].
Immunohistochemical examination was conducted
as previously described [26]. Briefly, paraffin-embedded
tissue was sectioned at 4 μm, deparaffinized in xylene,
and hydrated by ethyl alcohol, then antigen retrieval was
performed according to citrate-EDTA antigen retrieval
protocol [53]. Sections were stained with primary antibody
rabbit anti mouse CD31 antibody (1:50; Abcam; ab28364)
overnight, after rigorous wash with PBS for 3 times,
sections were incubated with secondary antibody Goat
anti Rabbit IgG-HRP (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch;
415–035-166) at room temperature for 1 hour. Coloring
was performed with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine substratechromogen (DAB) and Mayer's hematoxylin was used for
counter staining.

Detection of phosphorylation of VEGF
receptor-2

Statistical analysis
GraphPad prism 5.0 was used for statistical analysis.
Data was summarized as mean ± SEM. One way ANOVA
was used to determine the significant differences between
groups. Results were considered to be significant for
p-values of < 0.05.

Blood sample analysis
Animal blood was collected by eyeball removal
in the presence of anticoagulant EDTA. Hematological
