ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide.
Although recent studies facilitate the identification of crucial genes and relevant
regulatory pathways, therapeutic approaches against advanced HCC are insufficiently
effective. Therefore, we aimed here to develop potent therapeutics to provide a
reliable biomarker for the therapeutic efficacy in patients with HCC. To this end,
we first compared the cytotoxic effects of various anti-cancer drugs between well
differentiated (HAK-1A) and poorly differentiated (HAK-1B) cell lines established from
a single HCC tumor. Of various drug screened, HAK-1B cells were more sensitive by
a factor of 2,000 to the mTORC1 inhibitors (rapalogs), rapamycin and everolimus,
than HAK-1A cells. Although rapalogs inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448 in
HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells, phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 was specifically inhibited
only in HAK-1B cells. Silencing of Raptor induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth
of only HAK-1B cells. Further, three other cell lines established independently from
the tumors of three patients with HCC were also approximately 2,000-fold times
more sensitive to rapamycin, which correlated closely with the inhibition of mTOR
Ser2481 phosphorylation by rapamycin. Treatment with everolimus markedly
inhibited the growth of tumors induced by poorly differentiated HAK-1B and KYN-2
cells and phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first
study showing that the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 is selectively inhibited by
rapalogs in mTORC1-addicted HCC cells and may be a potential reliable biomarker for
the therapeutic efficacy of rapalogs for treating HCC patients.

INTRODUCTION

growth factor receptor (EGFR), and insulin-like growth
factor receptor (IGFR) may contribute to the malignant
progression of HCC [1]. Although systemic chemotherapy
is not effective, the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib
significantly increases the overall survival of patients with
advanced HCC [5, 6]. However, therapeutic effects of
sorafenib are limited to selected patients with preserved
liver function (Child-Pugh A), and its side effects limit its
applicability as well [1].
Expression profiling studies show that the MYC
oncogene drives the progression of dysplastic nodules to
early HCC [7]. Mutations in phosphoinositide-3-kinase

Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one
of the most common cancers worldwide, although there is
no effective therapy for patients with advanced HCC [1].
The pathogenesis of HCC comprises numerous genetic
and epigenetic changes that accumulate for years [2].
Focusing on abnormal genomic changes that occur in
HCC cells during disease progression is an established
strategy for the development of new therapies [3, 4].

(PI3K), catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA), TP53,
T cell factor 1 (TCF1), and WNT signaling pathway as
well as AKT activation predict unfavorable outcomes of
patients with HCC [8–11]. However, the contribution of
such oncogenic changes to the progression of HCC is
unknown.
To identify molecular targets that might determine
the aggressive phenotype of HCC, one approach compares
biochemical characteristics associated with cell growth,
survival, and drug sensitivity between benign and
malignant HCC cells in vitro. Certain HCCs form single
nodule-in-nodule tumors that comprise well differentiated
and poorly differentiated cancer cells in the outer and inner
nodules, respectively [12, 13]. Therefore, we established
well or poorly differentiated HCC cell lines (HAK-1A and
HAK-1B, respectively) from a single HCC tumor with a
nodule-in-nodule appearance [12]. These HCC cell lines
harbor identical structural abnormalities on chromosomes
2 and 7 and an identical point mutation in TP53 codon 242
[12, 14], indicating that HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells
are derived from the same clone. HAK-1B cells express
much lower levels of the specific differentiation marker,
the N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1),
compared with HAK-1A cells [15], indicating the poorly
differentiated phenotype of HAK-1B cells. HAK-1B
formed tumors in nude mice, but HAK-1A did not [15].
Here we compared the biochemical characteristics
of HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells as well as those of other
human HCC cell lines. We discovered that AKT was
constitutively phosphorylated in HAK-1B cells, which
were 2,000-fold more sensitive to the mTORC1 inhibitors
rapamycin and everolimus compared with HAK-1A cells.
Treatment with everolimus markedly inhibited the growth
of tumors induced by poorly differentiated HAK-1B and
KYN-2 cells in nude mice as well as phosphorylation of
mTOR Ser2481. Our findings indicate that inhibition of
mTOR Ser2481 phosphorylation might limit the sensitivity
of HCC cells to rapalogs.

Consistent with our previous study [15], NDRG1
was expressed at low and high levels in HAK-1B and
HAK-1A cells, respectively (Figure 1F). The levels of
expression of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
forms of EGFR family members were similar between
HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells, although the expression
of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of
c-Met, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)β,
and IGF-1Rβ were not detectable in HAK-1B cells
(Figure 1F). The levels of phosphorylated AKT (Thr308
and Ser473) were higher in HAK-1B cells compared with
those in HAK-1A cells (Figure 1G). In contrast, the levels
of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, phosphatase and
tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), and
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) were similar
in both cell lines (Figure 1G).

RESULTS

We compared the effects of selective inhibitors
of mTORC1 or dual inhibitors of mTORC1/C2 on the
phosphorylation of mTOR and related molecules in
HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells. The mTORC1-selective
inhibitors rapamycin and everolimus decreased the
phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448 and S6K in both
cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B),
although these inhibitors suppressed phosphorylation of
mTOR at Ser2481 only in HAK-1B cells. AKT residues
Thr308 and Ser473 were constitutively phosphorylated
in HAK-1B cells even in the presence of rapalogs.
In contrast, treatment with AZD8055 inhibited the
phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448 and Ser2481 as
well as AKT Ser473 in HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C). Further,
inhibition of the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481

HAK-1B cells are highly sensitive to the
cytotoxic effects of mTORC1 inhibitors
We assessed the sensitivities of HAK-1A and
HAK-1B cells to the cytotoxic effects of the multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib as well as those of other drugs that
target signaling molecules (Table 1) [5]. For example, the
cytotoxicity of sorafenib, SU11274 (an inhibitor of c-Met),
and picropodophyllin (PPP) (an inhibitor of IGF-1R) was
similar for both cell lines (Table 1). Gefitinib and erlotinib
(inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase) as well as LY294002
(an inhibitor of PI3K) were 3–5-fold more cytotoxic to
HAK-1B cells. In contrast, we found that rapamycin and
everolimus were 2,000-fold more cytotoxic to HAK-1B
cells. The dual inhibitors of mTORC1/C2, AZD8055 and
NVP-BEZ235, were 3–5-fold more cytotoxic for HAK-1B
cells (Figure 2A, Table 1).

HAK-1A cells proliferated as a monolayer with
a cobblestone-like arrangement, and HAK-1B cells
exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology and proliferated as
a monolayer with poor cell-to-cell contact (Figure 1A).
Although both cell lines grew at similar rates in culture
(Figure 1B), only HAK-1B xenografts formed tumors in
nude mice (Figure 1C). HAK-1B cells formed > 50 μm
colonies were more abundant than those formed by
HAK-1A cells (Figure 1D). Further, the ability of HAK-1B
cells to invade Matrigel was approximately 2-fold higher
compared with that of HAK-1A cells (Figure 1E).

mTOR binding to Raptor in both cell lines when S6K
phosphorylation was inhibited by 10 nM and 100 nM
rapamycin (Figure 3A). Rapamycin similarly affected the
dissociation of the mTORC1 complex in both cell lines.
Moreover, we did not detect mutations in the rapamycin
binding and activation domains of mTOR and Raptor in
both cell lines, respectively (data was not shown).
We next determined whether Raptor or Rictor, the
latter a component of mTORC2, differentially affected
cell survival and PI3K/AKT signaling in the two cell
lines. The growth of HAK-1B but not HAK-1A cells was
selectively inhibited after transfection with a Raptorsmall interfering RNAs (siRNA) for 3 days (Figure 3B).
In contrast, transfection of either cell line for 3 days with a
Rictor-siRNA did not inhibit the growth of either cell line
(Figure 3B). The Raptor-siRNA induced apoptosis of only
HAK-1B cells (Figure 3C). Moreover, Raptor knockdown
markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481
without affecting AKT Ser 473 only in HAK-1B cells
(Figure 3D). In contrast, Rictor knockdown suppressed the
phosphorylation of mTOR residues Ser2448 and Ser2481
as well as AKT Ser473 to similar levels in both cell lines
(Figure 3E).

Tumors formed in nude mice by HAK-1B and
KYN-2 cells are highly sensitive to everolimus

Phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 is selectively
inhibited by rapamycin in other rapamycinsensitive human HCC cell lines

We show here that phosphorylation of mTOR
Ser2481 predicts the therapeutic efficacy of mTORC1
inhibitors against HCC. Negative feedback control of
PI3K/AKT via mTORC1/S6K in HAK-1A cells is strictly
regulated, which is consistent with the results of studies
on other cancer and nontumorigenic cell lines [21]. This
negative feedback control is blocked by rapalogs when
mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation is inhibited, suggesting
a key role for the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448
in negative feedback control (Figure 6A). However,
rapalogs did not inhibit cell survival or growth signaling
in HAK-1A cells. We conclude therefore that the
phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448 was required for the
feedback suppression of PI3K/AKT signaling, although
it was insufficient to inhibit mTORC1-dependent cell
growth and survival signaling. In contrast, rapalogs did
not affect the phosphorylation of AKT, suggesting that
mTORC1 is independent of the upstream components of
the PI3K/AKT pathway in HAK-1B cells (Figure 6B).
Phosphorylation of mTOR residues Ser2448 and Ser2481
was inhibited by rapalogs in HAK-1B cells, causing
marked suppression of cell survival. Rapalog-induced
inhibition of phosphorylation of mTOR residues Ser2448
and Ser2481 is therefore required to inhibit mTORC1/
Raptor-addicted cell growth and survival that was
independent of AKT activation (Figure 6B).
Similar to HAK-1B cells, the HCC cell lines KIM-1,
KYN-2 and Huh-7 were highly sensitive to rapalogs
(Figure 4). Phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 was
blocked by rapamycin only in these three cell lines,
whereas the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448 was

KYN-2 cells did not express TSC-2 (Supplementary
Figure S1A), suggesting that the higher sensitivity of this
cell line to rapamycin was attributable to activation of
mTORC1. Therefore, we next asked whether an mTORC1
inhibitor suppressed the formation of tumors formed by
HAK-1B or KYN-2 cells in vivo and found that HAK-1B
and KYN-2 but not HAK-1A cells formed tumors in nude
mice (Figure 1C). Treatment with everolimus significantly
inhibited the growth of tumors formed by HAK-1B cells
(Figure 5A), and reduced the growth of tumors formed by
KYN-2 cells (Figure 5B). Immunohistochemical analysis
showed markedly decreased expression of phosphorylated
S6 in the tumors formed by HAK-1B or KYN-2 cells when
the mice were treated with everolimus (Figure 5C and 5D).
Western blot analysis of HAK-1B-induced tumors showed
marked reduction in the phosphorylation of mTOR
residues Ser2448 and Ser2481 as well as S6K and S6 when
mice were treated with everolimus (Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION

Three HCC cell lines designated KIM-1, KYN-2,
and Huh-7, derived from independent tumors of different
patients with HCC, were more sensitive to rapamycin by
a factor of 2,000 compared with the KYN-1, KYN-3, and
HepG2 cells (Figure 4A). In contrast, the six HCC cell
lines showed approximately 10-fold differences in their
sensitivities to AZD8055 (Figure 4B). The expression
levels of mTOR, phosphorylated (p)-mTOR, mTOR
pathway-related molecules, and p-AKT varied among all
eight HCC cell lines (Figure 4C).
We assessed previously reported mechanisms that
account for the relatively higher sensitivities to mTORC1
inhibitors of the eight HCC cell lines [17–20]. TSC-1 and
-2 are negative regulators of mTORC1, and knockdown
of their expression induces constitutive activation of the
mTORC1 pathway [17]. Further, enhanced p27 expression
correlates closely with sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibitors
[18]. Expression of TSC-1 and TSC-2 was decreased in
KYN-2 cells, and p27 expression was increased in KIM-1
and HAK-1B cells (Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B).
Rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR
Ser2448 and S6K in the six HCC cell lines (Figure 4D).
Rapamycin selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of
mTOR Ser2481 in KIM-1, KYN-2, and Huh-7 cells only
(Figure 4D). Treatment with Raptor-siRNA suppressed the
growth of KIM-1, KYN-2, and Huh-7 cells ≥ 50% of that
of the control cells (Figure 4E).

Figure 6: Hypothetical model of the acquisition of hypersensitivity to rapalogs by HCC cells. (A) Normally, PI3K/AKT
activation is under feedback regulation by mTORC1/S6K, such as in well differentiated HCC cells (e.g. HAK-1A cells). Rapalogs inhibit
feedback suppression by mTORC1/S6K, possibly through drug-induced inhibition of the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448, which is
accompanied by PI3K/AKT activation. Rapalogs do not affect the phosphorylation mTOR Ser2481 (mTORC1 complex), and the cells
survive in the presence of drugs. (B) In contrast, PI3K/AKT is constitutively activated in poorly differentiated HCC cells (e.g. HAK-1B cells),
and feedback control of PI3K/AKT by mTORC1 is dysregulated in this cell line. Rapalogs block the phosphorylation of both mTORC1
Ser2448 and Ser2481 that induces the death of HAK-1B cells through suppression of mTORC1-dependent cell growth, survival, and
metabolism.

inhibited by rapamycin in rapamycin-sensitive and
-insensitive cell lines (Figure 4D). Further, knockdown of
Raptor suppressed the growth of the rapamycin-sensitive
cell lines (Figure 4E), suggesting that their growth and
survival depended on cell signaling through the mTORC1
pathway.
The mechanism of selective inhibition of the
phosphorylation of mTOR S2481 by rapalogs and Raptor
knockdown is shared by HAK-1B and other rapalogsensitive HCC cell lines as well as other changes that
activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway. For example,
the loss of TSC-2 predicts the response to an mTORC1
inhibitor [20], and mTORC1 inhibits p27 expression in
close association with sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibitors
[18]. However, it is unclear whether such changes
of TSC-2 or p27 expression or both are involved in
hypersensitivity to rapalogs of these HCC cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S1).
The mTOR signaling pathway is upregulated in
15–50% of patients with HCC [22, 23], and mutations
of TSC-1/TSC-2 and LKB1, which encode regulators of
mTOR signaling, are observed in 5% of HCC patients [24].
In HCC cells, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is regulated
in close association with its upstream and downstream
signaling factors, including members of the IRS family
of adaptor molecules. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1),
which is a key downstream regulator of the IR and IGF1R
signaling pathways, mediates PI3K/AKT activation via
mTORC1-dependent feedback regulation [21]. However,
IRS-1 knockdown does not inhibit cell growth or alter
sensitivity to rapalogs in the HAK-1B and HAK-1A cell
lines (unpublished data), suggesting that it is less likely
that IRS-1 is directly involved in the hypersensitivity of
HAK-1B cells to rapalogs.
Nowadays, cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to
tumor resistance to chemotherapy/radiotherapy as well
as rapid tumor growth and the epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Keratin 19 (K19) is known as a
biomarker of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) that are
often found in HCC patients with poor prognosis [25].
Especially, K19 is reported as a key player in tumor
invasion in HCC. Therefore, we examined the expression
of K19 in HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells (Supplementary
Figure S2). Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that the expression of K19 was observed only in HAK1B cells, but not in HAK-1A. Our data supported that
HAK-1B exhibited malignant features including higher
invasive activity. In addition, Gorvaere et al. recently
reported that Laminin-332 induced K19 expression via
mTORC2 signaling pathway, and Laminin-332 sustained
chemoresistance including sorafenib of HCC cell line [26].
However, in our present study, the cytotoxicity of
sorafenib or other drugs except for rapalogs was similar
for both HAK-1A and HAK-1B cell lines (Table 1). Based
on our data, we concluded that K19 expression might be
contributed to higher invasive activity in HAK-1B. Further

studies are required to determine whether K19 expression
directly alters the sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibitor.
Inhibitors that target mTOR suppress the formation
of tumors by HCC cells in experimental model systems
[27, 28]. For example, everolimus inhibits tumor growth
and increases the survival rate of mice in an HCC xenograft
model, and a Raptor-specific siRNA reduces the viability
of HCC cells in vitro [29]. Rapamycin, everolimus,
AZD8055, and other mTOR inhibitors show some
therapeutic effectiveness when administered to patients
with advanced HCC [30, 31]. However, the EVOLVE-1
clinical trial that included 546 randomized patients reported
that everolimus did not improve overall survival in patients
with advanced HCC whose disease progressed during or
after receiving sorafenib or who are intolerant to sorafenib
[32]. Many other clinical trials of mTOR-targeting drugs
with or without sorafenib are in progress [31].
Serious problems associated with mTOR-targeted
therapeutics include the validation of the responses of
tumors and how therapy can be optimized for patients
with HCC [31]. Although biomarkers that indicate the
efficacy of mTOR inhibitors were validated in preclinical
and clinical studies of various tumor types, for example,
according to PIK3CA mutations, PTEN inactivation,
and expression levels of p-S6, p-S6K, S6K, and p-AKT
[33–35]; the validity of these markers was not confirmed in
clinical trials, including those of patients with HCC [31].
The present study is the first to our knowledge to
demonstrate that phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481
was specifically inhibited in HCC cell lines harboring
activated mTORC1/Raptor when treated with nanomolar
concentrations of mTORC1 inhibitors. We conclude
therefore that the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481
might provide a reliable marker for the therapeutic efficacy
of mTORC1 inhibitors for treating patients with HCC.
In conclusion, we reveal here a novel mechanism
involving the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 that is
selectively inhibited by rapalogs in mTORC1-addicted
HCC cells. Further studies are required to determine how
phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 drives the growth,
survival, and metabolism of HCC cells and why the
phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2481 is the key to limiting
the sensitivity of HCC cells to rapalogs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

differentiated HCC cell), HAK-1B (poorly differentiated
HCC cell), KIM-1 (moderately-differentiated HCC cell),
KYN-1 (moderately differentiated HCC cell), KYN-2
(moderately to poorly differentiated HCC cell) and KYN-3

Cell growth

Yano at Kurume University in 2010. HAK-1A and HAK-1B
has been established from a single nodule showing a threelayered structure with a different histological grade in
each layer from a 55-year-old Japanese male patient with
HCC [12]. KIM-1 has been established from a 76-year-old
Japanese male patient with HCC [36]. The resected tissue
was morphologically proliferative with trabecular pattern
corresponding to Edmondson-Steiner’s grade II. KYN-1
has been established from a resected HCC of a 58-year-old
Japanese male patient with HCC [37]. Original resected
HCC was moderately differentiated and proliferated in a
solid pattern with vague trabecular structure in part. KYN-2
has been established from a surgical specimen obtained
from a 52-year-old Japanese male HCC patient [38]. The
originally resected HCC was classified as pleomorphic
HCC corresponding to Edmondson-Steiner’s grade III with
a thick trabecular to solid arrangement. KYN-3 has been
established from a 60-year-old Japanese male at autopsy
[39]. In the liver section, tumor was proliferative with
trabecular pattern corresponding to Edmondson-Steiner’s
grade II-III. HepG2 cell line (well differentiated HCC cell)
was purchased from Riken (Saitama, Japan). Huh-7
(moderately differentiated HCC cell) was purchased
from ATCC. All cell lines were passaged for no longer
than 6 months. All cell lines were not further tested
or authenticated by the authors. These HCC cell lines
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 5% or 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 at 37°C [41, 42].

HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells (8 × 104) were seeded
in 35 mm dishes, and the cell numbers in each dish was
counted by a Z2 Coulter Particle Count and Size Analyzer
(Beckman Coulter Inc., CA) at 1 or 3 or 5 days [41, 42].
Results were expressed as the mean ± SD of triplicate
wells. For cell growth under Raptor or Rictor knockdown
condition, HAK-1A, HAK-1B, KIM-1, KYN-2 and Huh-7
cells (1 × 105 cells) were plated in 35 mm dish and
following day, cells were transfected with each siRNA.
The cell numbers in each dish was counted by a Z2 Coulter
Particle Count and Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter
Inc., CA) at 1 or 3 or 5 days. Triplicate dishes were tested
at each day. Results were expressed as the mean ± SD of
triplicate dishes.

Ethics statement
All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics
of Animal Experiments Committee at Kyushu University
Graduate School of Medical Sciences. 6–7-week-old male
BALB/c nu/nu athymic nude mice were purchased from
CLEA (Saga, Japan), and housed in microisolator cages
maintained under a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Water and
food were supplied ad libitum. Animals were observed
for signs of tumor growth, activity, feeding, and pain in
accordance with the guidelines of the Harvard Medical
Area Standing Committee on Animals, and accordance
with NIH guidelines.

Xenograft mouse experiment

Reagents

HAK-1B and KYN-2 cells were suspended in sterile
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of
2 × 108 cells/mL, and 100 μL was injected subcutaneously
into the right flank of 6–7-week-old male BALB/c athymic
nude mice, and the tumor diameters were measured
every 3 days from Day 7. Everolimus was dissolved
in carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC; Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Either
everolimus (2.0 mg/kg/day) or CMC was administered
orally daily. When tumor volume was in the range of 100
– 200 mm3, animals were randomly assigned to treatment
groups. These mice with tumors larger than 100 mm3 was
treated with everolimus or CMC. Tumor samples were
stored at −80°C for protein analysis or fixed immediately
in 10% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and then
processed for further histological analysis. The tumor size
was measured in two directions using calipers, and the
tumor volume (mm3) was estimated using the equation:
length × (width)2 × 0.5 as described previously [44].

Anti-NDRG1 antibody was generated as previously
described [43]. Other antibodies were purchased as
follows: anti-α-tubulin antibody was from Sigmaaldrich Co; anti-EGFR, anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068),

Immunoprecipitation assay

the peroxidase method (Histofine SABPO Kit; Nichirei,
Tokyo, Japan). Bright-field images were performed with
KEYENCE BZ-8000.

Total protein from HAK-1A and HAK-1B cell
lysates using lysis buffer was incubated for overnight
with specifically antibody at 4°C, followed by incubation
for 1 hour with Protein A/G plusagarose (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The precipitates were washed thrice
with ice-cold lysis buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE
followed by Western blot analysis. Anti-mTOR antibody
for immunoprecipitation was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology [45].

Matrigel on top culture (3-dimensional-growth
condition)
For the Matrigel on-top culture in 24 well plates,
under the bottom of the well was coated with 100 μl/well
of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37°C for
30 min to allow the gel to solidify. Subsequently, HAK-1A
and HAK-1B cells (1 × 104 cells) were resuspended in
1 mL of culture medium (DMEM medium supplemented
with 5% FBS), containing 2% Matrigel, and added to the
Matrigel-coated well.

Small interfering RNA transfection
HAK-1A and HAK-1B cells were transfected with
siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and Opti-MEM
medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The siRNA corresponding to Rictor
and control were purchased from Invitrogen. The siRNA
corresponding to Raptor was purchased from QIAGEN.

Matrigel invasion assay
BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers
(BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA) were used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. HAK-1A and HAK-1B
cells at 7.5 × 104 in serum-free DMEM were seeded onto
Matrigel-coated filters in the upper chambers. In the lower
chambers, DMEM containing 5% FBS was added as a
chemoattractant. After 24 h incubation, cells on the upper
surface of the filters were removed with a cotton swab, and
the filters were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with
Giemsa dye. The cells that had invaded to the lower side
of the filters were viewed under an Olympus microscope
and counted in five fields of view. The invasive ability of
the cancer cells was expressed as the mean number of cells
in five fields.

Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean ± SD of
n observations, and statistical differences among the
groups were assessed by two-tailed Student’s t-test. A
P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
