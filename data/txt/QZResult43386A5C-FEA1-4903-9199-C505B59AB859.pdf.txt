Abstract
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the major active ingredient
of turmeric (Curcuma longa) used in South Asian cuisine
for centuries. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit the growth
of transformed cells and to have a number of potential
molecular targets. However, the essential molecular targets of
curcumin under physiologic conditions have not been
completely defined. Herein, we report that the tumor cellular
proteasome is most likely an important target of curcumin.
Nucleophilic susceptibility and in silico docking studies show
that both carbonyl carbons of the curcumin molecule are
highly susceptible to a nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl
group of the NH2-terminal threonine of the proteasomal
chymotrypsin-like (CT-like) subunit. Consistently, curcumin
potently inhibits the CT-like activity of a purified rabbit 20S
proteasome (IC50 = 1.85 Mmol/L) and cellular 26S proteasome.
Furthermore, inhibition of proteasome activity by curcumin in
human colon cancer HCT-116 and SW480 cell lines leads to
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and several proteasome target proteins, and subsequent induction of apoptosis.
Furthermore, treatment of HCT-116 colon tumor–bearing ICR
SCID mice with curcumin resulted in decreased tumor growth,
associated with proteasome inhibition, proliferation suppression, and apoptosis induction in tumor tissues. Our study
shows that proteasome inhibition could be one of the
mechanisms for the chemopreventive and/or therapeutic
roles of curcumin in human colon cancer. Based on its ability
to inhibit the proteasome and induce apoptosis in both HCT116 and metastatic SW480 colon cancer cell lines, our study
suggests that curcumin could potentially be used for treatment of both early-stage and late-stage/refractory colon
cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7283–92]

Introduction
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the active ingredient of
turmeric, derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. Besides its
traditional use as a food coloring and flavoring agent, curcumin
also has a well-documented history in medicine in India and
Southeast Asia. Curcumin is used to treat various diseases,
including respiratory conditions, inflammation, liver disorders,
diabetic wounds, cough, and certain tumors (1).

Although curcumin has been shown to inhibit the growth of
transformed cells and all three stages of colon carcinogenesis
(initiation, promotion, and progression) in carcinogen-induced
rodent models, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Many molecular targets have been suggested including
various transcription factors, inflammatory enzymes, cytokines,
adhesion molecules, and cell survival proteins (2).
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential for many
fundamental cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis,
angiogenesis, and differentiation (3, 4). The proteasome contributes to the pathologic state of several human diseases including
cancer and AIDS, in which some regulatory proteins are either
stabilized due to decreased degradation or lost due to accelerated
degradation (5). The 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core of
26S proteasome complex, contains multiple peptidase activities
including the chymotrypsin like (CT-like), trypsin like (T-like),
and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing like (PGPH-like; ref. 6).
It has been shown that inhibition of tumor cellular CT-like activity
is a strong stimulus that induces apoptosis (7, 8). The possibility
of therapeutically targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was
initially met with great skepticism because this pathway plays an
important role in normal cellular homeostasis as well. However,
after the demonstration that actively proliferating cancer cells are
more sensitive to apoptosis-inducing stimuli, including proteasome
inhibition, proteasome inhibitors became the subject of further
investigation (9–11). With the finding that proteasome inhibitors
were well-tolerated and had activity in experimental models of
human malignancies in vivo (12), the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib (Velcade/PS-341) was introduced into a phase I clinical
trial (13). Although the data from the bortezomib trials showed
significant clinical benefit, some toxicity was observed (14). The
most common side effects include nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea,
whereas more adverse events are thrombocytopenia, peripheral
neuropathy, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and hyponatremia. Among
them, peripheral neuropathy is the one that often causes an early
cessation of the treatment (4). Therefore, there is a need to search
for other proteasome inhibitors with less or no toxic side effects,
e.g., from naturally occurring or nutritional compounds, mostly
because they are generally more tolerable in human body (15).
The benefit and chemopreventative role of dietary curcumin
was observed in a variety of rodent models of carcinogenesis. As
a logical consequence, curcumin is currently in clinical trials for
treatment of various cancers, including multiple myeloma,
pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer (16). The fact that colon
cancer is one of the leading cancer-related deaths in Western
countries and that current treatment options have only limited
efficacy against advanced colon cancer contributes to the
increasing interest for the use of curcumin in colon cancer
prevention (17). Moreover, curcumin has been shown to inhibit the

expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that plays a significant
role in colon carcinogenesis (18). It is also important to emphasize
that to date, no toxicity associated with curcumin in either
experimental animals or humans, even at very high doses, has been
observed (2).
Curcumin-induced suppression of carcinogenesis is thought to
be due to inhibition of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), which is
controlled by the proteasome-mediated proteolytic degradation
pathway (19), and subsequent inhibition of proinflammatory
pathways (20). Additionally, curcumin was shown to down-regulate
cyclin D1, cyclin E, and MDM2; up-regulate p21, p27, and p53; and
to induce apoptosis (2).
A recent report revealed that curcumin enhanced the antitumor
activity of celecoxib, indicating their synergistic effect on the
growth of colorectal cancer cells (21). Trials currently underway
include an evaluation of colon cancer patients treated with
gemcitabine in combination with curcumin and celecoxib
(NCT00295035; Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center). Recently, we
have reported that in colon cancer cells, curcumin acts synergistically with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin (FOLFOX),
a chemotherapeutic regimen that, together with 5-fluorouracil,
irinotecan, and leucovorin, remains the backbone of colon cancer
treatment (22). Taken together, the results suggest that chemotherapeutics in combination with curcumin may provide a superior
therapeutic strategy in the clinical setting for treatment of
refractory tumors.
In the present study, we have studied the potential molecular
target of curcumin in human colon cancer cells. We first show that
a computer docking model predicts curcumin to inhibit proteasomal chymothypsin-like activity. We then show that curcumin
indeed directly inhibits the CT-like activity of a purified rabbit 20S
proteasome (IC50 = 1.85 Amol/L) and 26S proteasome in human
colon cancer HCT-116 and SW480 cell lines. After proteasome
inhibition, apoptotic cell death was induced. Furthermore,
treatment of colon cancer–bearing ICR SCID mice with curcumin
(500 mg/kg/d, intragastric, for 21 days) resulted in tumor growth
suppression, associated with in vivo proteasome inhibition, growth
arrest, and apoptosis induction. Our results suggest that curcumin
has proteasome-inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo and could
effectively be used for the prevention and treatment of human
colon cancer.

Dr. Charles D. Lopez, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR)

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

and metastatic SW480 cell lines (a generous gift from Prof. Satya Narayan,
UF Shands Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL, USA) were grown in DMEM/F12
and McCoy’s 5A medium, respectively, both supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin at
37jC in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. A whole cell
extract preparation and Western blot analysis were done as previously
described (24). Densitometry was quantified using AlphaEase FC software
(Alpha Innotech Corporation).
Inhibition of purified 20S proteasome activity. Purified rabbit 20S
proteasome (17.5 ng) was incubated with 10 Amol/L of the various
substrates in 100 AL of assay buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)] in the
presence of curcumin at various concentrations or equivalent volume of
solvent ethanol as a control. After 2 h of incubation at 37jC, inhibition of
each proteasomal activity was measured by the release of hydrolyzed AMC
groups, as previously described (24).
Inhibition of the proteasomal CT-like activity in intact cells. HCT116 or SW480 cells were cultured in 96-well plates (1  104 cells per well)
and treated for various time points with different concentrations of
curcumin or MG132. After the additional 2-h incubation with the
fluorogenic peptide substrate specific for the proteasomal CT-like activity,
production of hydrolyzed AMC groups was measured, as described above.
Caspase-3/-7 activity assay. Proteins extracted from treated cells were
incubated in 100 AL of assay buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)] with
20 Amol/L fluorogenic substrate specific for caspase-3/-7 activity. After
3 h incubation at 37jC, release of hydrolyzed AMC groups was measured
as described above.
Cellular morphology analysis and terminal deoxynecleotydyl
transferase–mediated dUPT-biotin nick end-labeling assay. A Zeiss
Axiovert 25 microscope was used for all microscopic imaging with phase
contrast for cellular morphology as described previously (25). Terminal
deoxynecleotydyl transferase–mediated dUPT-biotin nick end-labeling assay
(TUNEL) was performed using the BD Biosciences PharMingen,
APO-DIRECT kit. Cells were treated with various curcumin concentrations
for 24 h, harvested, fixed, and stained according to the protocol.
Mice and tumor cell implantation. Six-week-old female homozygous
ICR SCID mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. The mice were
adapted to animal housing and HCT-116 xenografts were developed as
described earlier (26). Before treatment, curcumin was dissolved in DMSO
( final volume 0.05%) and further diluted in sesame oil. Tumor growth
deduced as volume of the tumor in each group was determined by twice
weekly caliper measurements. All mice were euthanized 1 d after the last
dose of treatment. H&E staining confirmed the presence of tumor.
Determination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunoreactivity, apoptosis by TUNEL assay, immunostaining, and H&E assays
using tumor tissue samples. Determination of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) immunoreactivity, as a measure of proliferative activity,
was done as described previously (27). TUNEL assay was done to detect
apoptotic cells using the In situ Cell Death Detection kit from Roche
Applied Science according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunostaining of p27 was done as described previously (28). H&E staining in tumor
tissues were performed following manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as mean F SD for the absolute
values as indicated in the vertical axis legend of figures. The statistical
significance of differential findings between curcumin-treated and control
mice was determined by Student’s t test as implemented by Excel 2000
(Microsoft Corp.). P values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results
Curcumin adopts a proteasome-inhibitory pose in an in silico
model. We have reported that the ester bond carbon of h-lactone,
the green tea polyphenol ( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate [( )-EGCG],
( )-EGCG analogues, and tannic acid is responsible for the potent
and specific proteasomal CT-like inhibition (29–31). Moreover, our
recent data suggest that the carbonyl carbon of tea polyphenols

and flavonoids confers their proteasome-inhibitory potencies
(32, 33). Because curcumin contains two carbonyl carbons
(Fig. 1A), we hypothesized and found both of them to be the sites
of nucleophilic susceptibility (Fig. 1B).
We then proposed that curcumin is susceptible to nucleophilic
attack by NH2-terminal threonine (Thr 1) of the h5 CT-like subunit
of the proteasome and is able to be oriented in an inhibitory pose
within this subunit. To test this, curcumin was docked to the
proteasomal h5 subunit, and cluster analysis was performed. The
predictability of binding was determined based on the frequency
of curcumin to adopt an inhibitory pose (a pose that places the
curcumin carbonyl carbon within 4.0 Å of Thr 1). Curcumin docked
with an average of 80 of 100 poses (80%) that placed at least one of
the carbonyl carbons in a suitable position to undergo nucleophilic
attack and the most representative pose is shown in Fig. 1C.
Furthermore, due to exposed hydroxyl groups, curcumin could
potentially form a hydrogen bonds with the surrounding amino
acids, such as Serine 96 with a distance of 2.18 Å in the h5-subunit
(Fig. 1C), strengthening its binding potential. Therefore, the
computer docking results predict that curcumin binds to Thr 1
of the proteasomal h5-subunit, which might cause inhibition of
the proteasomal CT-like activity.
Inhibition of purified 20S proteasome CT-like activity by
curcumin. To provide direct evidence for proteasome inhibition
by curcumin, we carried out a cell-free proteasome activity assay
by incubating a purified rabbit 20S proteasome with different
concentrations of curcumin. As predicted by the in silico model, we
found that the h5-mediated CT-like activity of the purified 20S
proteasome was significantly inhibited by curcumin with an IC50
value of 1.85 Amol/L (Fig. 1D). To investigate whether curcumin
specifically inhibits the proteasomal CT-like activity, its effects on

the T-like and PGPH-like activities of the purified 20S proteasome
were also examined. When used at 1 Amol/L, curcumin inhibited
the CT-like, T-like, and PGPH-like activities of the purified 20S
proteasome by 46%, 20%, and 34%, respectively (Fig. 1D), whereas
at 5 Amol/L, it inhibited these three proteasomal activities by 73%,
46%, and 59%, respectively (Fig. 1D). The IC50 values of curcumin to
the CT-like, T-like, and PGPH-like activities of the purified 20S
proteasome were determined to be 1.85, 6.23, and 3.68 Amol/L,
respectively. Taken together, our results show that curcumin
possesses the ability to inhibit all the three proteasomal activities
but with the highest potency to the CT-like activity.
Curcumin inhibits proteasomal activity and induces apoptosis in human colon cancer HCT-116 and SW480 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. After demonstrating that curcumin
inhibits the purified 20S proteasome (Fig. 1), the next set of
experiments was performed to determine if curcumin would also
target and inhibit the tumor cellular 26S proteasome. Human colon
cancer HCT-116 and SW480 cells were plated in 96-well plates and
treated with various concentrations of curcumin for 24 hours,
followed by 2 hours of additional incubation with a specific peptide
substrate for the proteasomal CT-like activity. We found a dosedependent inhibition induced by curcumin in both colon cancer
cell lines (Fig. 2A). When used at a 10 Amol/L concentration,
curcumin induced 32% and 42% inhibition in HCT-116 and
SW480 cells, respectively, whereas at 30 Amol/L concentration,
65% and 81% inhibition was induced in HCT-116 and SW480 cells,
respectively (Fig. 2A).
We also compared curcumin to a well-known proteasome
inhibitor MG132. When used at 10 or 30 Amol/L concentrations in
HCT-116 cells, MG132 induced 53% and 70% inhibition, respectively (Fig. 2A), showing similar potency to curcumin.

used as a control (E ). Columns, mean of representative independent triplicate experiments; bars, SD.

human HCT-116 and SW480 colon cancer cells by
curcumin (cur ). A, inhibition of proteasomal CT-like activity
by curcumin in intact HCT-116 and SW480 cells. HCT-116
and SW480 cells were treated with different curcumin
concentrations (10, 20, and 30 Amol/L) for 24 h, followed
by measurement of proteasomal CT-like activity.
Proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used as comparison
with curcumin and the solvent, ethanol, was used as a
control. B, Western blot analysis. HCT-116 and SW480
cells were treated with different curcumin concentrations
(10, 20, and 30 Amol/L) for 24 h, and used for whole cell
extract preparation. Cell extract was analyzed by Western
blot for accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, InB-a, and
Bax (right and left ). Proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used
as comparison to curcumin (middle ), and the solvent,
ethanol, was used as a control. Actin was used as a loading
control. Change in the levels of ubiquitinated InB-a and
p36/Bax proteins in the cells treated with curcumin, and the
levels of ubiquitinated InB-a and p21/Bax proteins in the
cells treated with MG132 were analyzed by densitometry
and quantified using AlphaEase FC software. RFU, relative
flourescence unit.

To further confirm the proteasomal inhibition caused by
curcumin, HCT-116 and SW480 cells were treated for 24 hours,
harvested, and used for cell extraction, followed by Western blot
analysis. We found a dose-dependent accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in both cell lines (Fig. 2B, left and right). We have
previously reported an ubiquitinated form of InB-a protein with
molecular weight of f56 kDa (34). Dose-dependent accumulation
of a similar p56 band was detected in both cell lines, after 24 hours
of treatment (Fig. 2B, left and right). It is well-known that
ubiquitinated InB-a protein is recognized and degraded by the
proteasome leading to release of NF-nB and its translocation to the
nucleus, where it activates genes involved in cell proliferation and
survival. However, when the proteasomal activity is inhibited,
ubiquitinated IkB-a stays bound to NF-nB, preventing its
transcriptional activity. Therefore, accumulation of ubiquitinated
form of IkB-a upon curcumin treatment confirms proteasomal
inhibition. As a comparison, treatment of HCT-116 cells with
MG132 had similar effect on accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins and ubiquitinated IkB-a (Fig. 2B, middle).
To investigate whether the proteasomal inhibition by curcumin
is associated with apoptosis induction, caspase-3/-7 activation and
PARP cleavage were measured, and TUNEL assay was performed.
After 24 hours of treatment with curcumin, a dose-dependent
increase in caspase-3/-7 activity was detected in both HCT-116 and
SW480 cells (Fig. 3A). At 10 Amol/L concentration, curcumin
induced a 6.4-fold and 8.2-fold increase in HCT-116 and SW480

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

cells, respectively, whereas at 30 Amol/L, it induced 8.4-fold and
16.6-fold increase in HCT-116 and SW480 cells, respectively
(Fig. 3A). It has been shown that caspase-3/-7 activation is
associated with production of the p85 cleaved PARP fragment (35),
which we detected by Western blot analysis, together with a p65
PARP fragment (Fig. 3B, left and right), which was previously shown
to be a product of calpain cleavage (36). The calpain involvement
is further supported by the accumulation of p36/Bax, a homodimer
of p18/Bax (a calpain cleaved product of p21/Bax; refs. 37, 38),
found in the cells treated with all three concentrations of curcumin
in both cell lines (and to some extent, in the cells treated with
MG132; Fig. 2B). Our results show that curcumin is able to inhibit
the proteasomal CT-like activity and activate caspase-3/-7 and
calpain, thereby inducing apoptosis in human colon cancer
HCT116 and SW480 cells. Treatment with MG132 had similar
apoptosis-inducing effect in HCT-116 cells (Fig. 3A and B, middle).
Dose-dependent apoptosis induction by curcumin was confirmed
with TUNEL assay (Fig. 3C; data not shown). At the highest
concentration used (30 Amol/L), curcumin induced production of
69.1% apoptotic HCT-116 and 90.7% apoptotic SW480 cells
(Fig. 3C). Curcumin also induced apoptosis-related changes in cell
morphology (shrunken cells and blebbing) in a concentrationdependent manner (data not shown). Therefore, SW480 cells are
slightly more sensitive to curcumin treatment than HCT-116 cells.
Because curcumin has been previously shown to induce cell cycle
arrest (16), we wanted to investigate if under our experimental

Curcumin Inhibits Proteasome in Colon Cancer Cells

conditions, in addition to apoptosis induction, curcumin also
affected cell cycle progression. Western blot analysis was used
to examine the levels of Cyclin D1, which is essential for G1-S
transition. Twenty-four hour treatment with either concentration of
curcumin did not significantly affect Cyclin D1 protein expression
(Fig. 3B, left and right), indicating that under these conditions,
curcumin-mediated proteasome inhibition mainly triggers apoptosis. Under the same experimental condition, 30 Amol/L MG132
induced f2-fold increase in Cyclin D1 protein level (Fig. 3B,
middle). MG132 was also found to have stronger antiproliferative
effect against HCT-116 cells compared with curcumin, whereas the
ability of curcumin to inhibit proliferation of HCT-116 and SW480
cells was very similar, as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (data not shown).
Curcumin-induced proteasome inhibition and apoptosis
induction are time dependent. To further study the effect of
curcumin in human colon cancer cells, HCT-116 cells plated in 96well plate were treated with 20 Amol/L curcumin for various time
points (0.5–12 hours). We found that 60% of the proteasomal CT-

like activity was inhibited as early as half an hour after the addition
of curcumin and remained inhibited at about the same extent
for the rest of the experimental period (Fig. 4A). Proteasomal
inhibition was confirmed with Western blot analysis that showed
an increased level of ubiquitinated proteins after 6 hours of
treatment, together with the accumulation of the proteasomal
target proteins, InB-a, p27, and p21/Bax (Fig. 4B).
In the same kinetic experiment, apoptosis-associated morphologic changes were observed after the first 6 hours of treatment,
and these changes were greatly increased after 48 hours (Fig. 4D).
To confirm apoptosis induction, we measured the activity of
caspase-3/-7 and found a 4-, 6.5-, 11-, and 13-fold increase at 6, 16,
24, and 48 hours, respectively (Fig. 4C). Apoptosis was also
confirmed with Western blot analysis by the presence of PARP
cleavage (Fig. 4B). The appearance of p65-cleaved PARP fragment
and accumulation of p36/Bax were also detected during the treatment (Fig. 4B), again supporting activation of calpain. Additionally,
slight down-regulation (f30%) of Cyclin D1 by curcumin was
found at the later time point (48 hours; Fig. 4C).

Curcumin suppresses the growth of human colon cancer
HCT-116 xenografts, associated with proteasome inhibition,
proliferation suppression, and apoptosis induction. After we
showed that curcumin inhibited proteasomal activity and induced
apoptosis in cultured colon cancer cells (Figs. 3 and 4), we
investigated whether the antitumor activity of curcumin could, at
least partly, be attributed to inhibition of the proteasomal activity
and induction of apoptosis in vivo. To do so, we implanted HCT116 cells (3  106) s.c. into ICR SCID mice (both flanks). When the
tumors began to enlarge (50 mm3), mice were randomized into the
2 groups for treatment of vehicle control and curcumin (500 mg/kg
body weight given intragastric every day for 3 weeks). Inhibition of
tumor growth by curcumin was observed after a 21-day treatment,
confirming the antitumor activity of curcumin (Fig. 5A). Control
tumors grew to an average size of 1,587 mm3, and curcumintreated tumors grew to 959 mm3, corresponding to 40% inhibition
(P < 0.01; Fig. 5A).
To determine if the observed antitumor effect of curcumin was
associated with its proteasome-inhibitory activity, we extracted

proteins from the tumor remnants and used them for multiple
assays. We found that the proteasomal CT-like activity was inhibited
by 55% in the tumors from mice treated with curcumin, compared
with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5B). This was associated with the
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the proteasome target
proteins p27, InB-a, and p21/Bax (Fig. 5C). Increased expression of
p27 was confirmed with immunostaining only in the tumors from
mice treated with curcumin (Fig. 6A). The results show that
curcumin is able to inhibit tumor proteasome activity in vivo.
The formalin-fixed tumor tissue was analyzed to determine
whether curcumin-induced proteasomal inhibition found in colon
cancer caused a consequent inhibition of proliferation and
stimulation of apoptosis. There was a 3-fold reduction in PCNA
immunoreactivity (a marker of cell proliferation) in the tumor
remnants of curcumin-treated ICR SCID mice compared with the
vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 5D, top). Consistent with growth
inhibition in vivo by curcumin, Western blot analysis showed
down-regulation of Cyclin D1, another marker of cell proliferation,
in the tumors from mice treated with curcumin, compared with

with curcumin (Figs. 3 and 4).
Apoptosis was then determined using the TUNEL assay, which
showed a 2-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the
tumors from mice treated with curcumin compared with the
corresponding vehicle-treated control (Fig. 5D, bottom). High levels
of condensed apoptotic nuclei, another apoptotic feature, together
with necrotic tumor cells were observed in tumors from curcumintreated animals after H&E staining (Fig. 6B). As a comparison, in
tumor tissue from mice treated with solvent, only few apoptotic
cells and much more nonapoptotic cells were found. Taken
together, these data show that curcumin has the ability to regress
colon cancer growth in ICR SCID mice bearing HCT-116 xenografts
by inhibiting the proteasomal CT-like activity, resulting in
proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction.

Discussion
Interest in potential cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic
properties of dietary ingredients, which are generally more
tolerable in the human body (15), has increased in recent years,
especially for the cancers that usually do not respond well to
currently available therapies (17). Therefore, it is not surprising
that chemoprevention of colon cancer, the leading cancer-related
death in Western countries, is becoming more attractive. One of the
dietary ingredients that possess anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant properties is curcumin. Epidemiologic data suggest that
curcumin may be responsible for the lower colon cancer rate in
India and Southeast Asia (39). Based on that and its long history

www.aacrjournals.org

of consumption without any adverse health effects, curcumin is
considered to be a safe chemopreventative agent (15).
Although it was suggested previously that curcumin-induced
apoptosis is mediated through the impairment of the ubiquitinproteasome pathway (40), the exact mechanism was not fully
elucidated. Although the antioxidative property of curcumin is welldocumented, it has also been shown that at higher concentrations
(50 and 100 Amol/L), curcumin could induce apoptosis through
production of reactive oxygen intermediates (41). Therefore, it was
hypothesized that curcumin could induce proteasomal malfunction
through the oxidative stress generation (40). Another possible
mechanism for the proteasomal inhibition induced by curcumin
was proposed based on its chemical structure. Because it belongs to
a class of compounds with a,h-unsaturated ketones and two
sterically accessible h carbons, curcumin was suggested to inhibit
the ubiquitin isopeptidase activity located at the 19S regulatory
subunit of the 26S proteasome (42).
On the other hand, the chemical structure of curcumin led us
to the hypothesis of the direct binding of curcumin to the 20S
proteasome. By using an in silico model, we found that both
carbonyl carbons are indeed susceptible to nucleophilic attack by
Thr 1 within the h5 subunit of the proteasome (Fig. 1B and C),
suggesting that curcumin binds to Thr 1 with high predictability.
The proteasomal inhibition by curcumin was confirmed by an
in vitro experiment that showed a significant inhibition of the
CT-like activity of a purified 20S proteasome with an IC50 value of
1.85 Amol/L (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that
inhibition of proteasomal CT-like activity induced by curcumin is
mediated through its direct binding.

In our study, we used physiologic concentrations of curcumin
(10–30 Amol/L), thereby excluding the possibility that curcumininduced reactive oxygen species production is involved in proteasomal inhibition. We have further confirmed that this inhibition is
physiologically functional by demonstrating accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome target proteins InB-a, p27,
and p21/Bax. More importantly, our data show that intragastric
treatment of HCT-116 tumor-bearing IRA SCID mice with curcumin
resulted in the inhibition of proteasomal CT-like activity in the
tumors (Figs. 5B and C and 6A), associated with a 40% inhibition of
tumor growth (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the effective plasma levels of
curcumin have been reached. Consistent with previous reports (7, 8),
we found that inhibition of the proteasomal CT-like activity, induced
by curcumin in colon cancer cells and xenografts, was associated
with the induction of apoptosis (Figs. 3–6). We have also found that
inhibition of tumor growth was caused not only by apoptosis
induction but also by induction of cell cycle arrest, most probably G1
arrest, as shown by decreased levels of two proliferation markers
PCNA (Fig. 5D) and Cyclin D1 (Fig. 5C), and accumulation of p27
(Figs. 5C and 6A). However, this G1 arrest was not observed in
cultured cells treated with curcumin (Figs. 3 and 4).

When comparing the in vitro and in vivo potencies of curcumin,
we found that although 1.85 Amol/L curcumin was sufficient to
inhibit 50% of the CT-like activity of purified 20S proteasome
(Fig. 1D), a much higher concentration of curcumin (10 Amol/L)
produced only 32% to 42% inhibition of the CT-like activity in colon
cancer cells (Fig. 2A). This finding is similar to previous reports
with other natural compounds with proteasome-inhibitory activities (30), suggesting that natural compounds have more than
one cellular target and/or might not be very stable in cells.
Furthermore, our in silico data show that two hydroxyl groups
could potentially form hydrogen bonds with surrounding amino
acids in the h5-subunit, strengthening the potential of curcumin to
bind the proteasome. Modification of these two hydrogen groups,
such as methylation, could also explain the lower potency of
curcumin to bind and inhibit the proteasome within the cells, as
opposed to the purified 20S proteasome.
We have also shown that curcumin inhibited f60% of the
proteasomal activity within the first 30 minutes of the treatment,
which did not change much until the end of 48 hour treatment
(Fig. 4A). However, due to the cumulative effect of this continuous
inhibition, the level of proteasomal target proteins did increase

Curcumin Inhibits Proteasome in Colon Cancer Cells

after 6 hours of treatment. Once the level of accumulated
proapoptotic proteins reached the critical level for apoptosis
induction and caspase-3/-7 activation, the cells became committed
to apoptosis, resulting in time-dependent caspase-3/-7 activation.
We also found that although the proteasome activity was not
completely inhibited in cultured tumor cells (30–50% inhibition),
apoptosis was still induced by curcumin, supporting the idea of
the proteasome being an important cellular target for curcumin.
Moreover, curcumin was shown to be a highly pleiotropic molecule
that can interact with numerous molecular targets, thereby
affecting various biochemical cascades and pathways, including
caspase cascade and apoptosis (2).
We have published that some natural compounds with
proteasome-inhibitory activity such as ( )-EGCG are unstable
under physiologic conditions and could be rapidly degraded or
metabolized through interactions with the hydroxyl groups on the
phenol rings (43). Knowing that curcumin contains two hydroxyl
groups, it is possible that the same mechanism could be applied on
curcumin. Indeed, a number of studies over the past three decades
have shown that poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid
systemic elimination of curcumin are responsible for its poor
bioavailability (44). In an attempt to improve the bioavailability of
curcumin, different approaches have been undertaken, such as
combining curcumin treatment with piperine, a known inhibitor of
hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation. This combinational treatment was found to significantly enhance serum concentration,
absorption level, and bioavailability of curcumin in both rats and
humans with no adverse effects (45).
Because curcumin undergoes a rapid and efficient metabolism
and biotransformation during absorption in the intestinal tract
(17), it would be expected that different parts of the intestine,
including the colon, would accumulate a higher concentration of
curcumin in the metabolically active form, compared with other
organs. Numerous trials investigating the chemopreventative and
therapeutic effects of curcumin alone or in combination with other
natural or synthetic compounds have been and continue to be
carried out (2). Curcumin has been shown to potentiate the
antitumor effects of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells growing
in vitro or in vivo (46) and synergize with FOLFOX in colon cancer
cells in vitro (22). It has also been shown that curcumin potentiates
the effect of gemcitabine, paclitaxel, tumor necrosis factor, and
TRAIL against bladder cancer cells (47). These results are
consistent with that proteasome inhibition could chemosensitize
human cancer cells (48). On the other hand, curcumin has also
been found to significantly inhibit the chemotherapy-induced effect
of camptothecin, mechlorethamine, and doxorubicin in breast
cancer cells in vitro, and cyclophosphamide-induced tumor
regression in vivo (1). Therefore, to design a better and more
efficient combination treatment that includes curcumin, it is
necessary not only to identify its molecular targets but also to show
that curcumin could reach them in vivo.
It has been shown that overexpression of COX-2 in intestinal
epithelium is associated with increased colon cancer incidence

and progression, and that curcumin has potential to specifically
inhibit COX-2 expression at the RNA and protein level (49).
Although the underlying mechanism of COX-2 inhibition by
curcumin is not well-understood, it seems to be different from
the class of COX-2 inhibitors that act through direct binding to
the COX-2 enzyme (50). Different mechanisms of action are
supported by the fact that no toxicity associated with curcumin
treatment, even when used at very high doses, has been observed
(2). On the other hand, the observed toxicity associated with
COX-2 inhibitor treatment seems to be result of their specific
chemical properties and are unrelated to COX-2 binding and
inhibition (51). Because both colon cancer cell lines used in our
study (HCT-116 and SW480) do not express COX-2, our finding is
consistent with previously published data, which indicate that
growth inhibition of colon cancer cells by curcumin is
independent of COX-2 expression (49) and supported by recently
published finding that docosahexaenoic acid stimulates degradation of h-catenin and induces apoptosis in the same cell lines
independently of COX-2 inhibition (52). Our data showing that
curcumin is able to inhibit the proteasome and induce apoptosis
in both, HCT-116 and metastatic colon cancer SW480 cells,
suggests its possible use for treatment of both early stage and late
stage/refractory colon cancer.
In summary, our data reveal the proteasome as an important
cellular target of curcumin in vitro and in vivo. We have shown
that inhibition of the proteasomal activity (especially, the CT-like
activity) by curcumin is a strong apoptotic stimulus for both colon
cancer HCT-116 and SW480 cell lines in vitro and that SW480 cells
are slightly more sensitive to curcumin treatment than HCT-116
cells. We have also shown that intragastric administration of
curcumin to ICR SCID mice bearing xenografts of colon cancer
HCT-116 cells resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth,
as a consequence of proteasomal inhibition, inhibition of cell
proliferation, and stimulation of apoptosis. The fact that curcumin
is able to target the human colon tumor proteasome and inhibit
human colon tumor growth in vivo provides a strong impetus for
using curcumin as a chemopreventative and/or chemotherapeutic
agent for human colon cancer.
