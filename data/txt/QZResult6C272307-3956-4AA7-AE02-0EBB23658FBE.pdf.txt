ABSTRACT
The failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy in breast cancers has been closely
associated with the presence of drug resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus,
screening for small molecules that selectively inhibit growth of CSCs may offer
great promise for cancer control, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. In
this report, we provide the first demonstration that cardamonin, a small molecule,
selectively inhibits breast CSCs that have been enriched by chemotherapeutic
drugs. In addition, cardamonin also sufficiently prevents the enrichment of CSCs
when simultaneously used with chemotherapeutic drugs. Specifically, cardamonin
effectively abolishes chemotherapeutic drug-induced up-regulation of IL-6, IL-8 and
MCP-1 and activation of NF-κB/IKBα and Stat3. Furthermore, in a xenograft mouse
model, co-administration of cardamonin and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin
significantly retards tumor growth and simultaneously decreases CSC pools in vivo.
Since cardamonin has been found in some herbs, this work suggests a potential new
approach for the effective treatment of breast CSCs by administration of cardamonin
either concurrent with or after chemotherapeutic drugs.

However, current treatments mainly target the bulk of
the tumor cells rather than CSCs, which may lead to
drug resistance and subsequent recurrence and metastasis
[10]. Several recent studies have shown that breast CSCs
could be enriched following chemotherapy [5, 11–13],
suggesting that complete eradication of CSCs is necessary
to achieve a cure [6–9]. As such, a new strategy combining
conventional tumor-shrinking cytotoxic drugs and CSCtargeting agents may lead to better disease control and
prevent breast cancer relapse.
Recently, the use of natural phytochemicals to
impede tumors has gained immense importance [14].
Cardamonin, found in cardamom spice and many other
plant species, has been studied extensively as a chemopreventive agent in a variety of cancers, including
breast, hematological, gastrointestinal, and colorectal

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer diagnosed
among women in the world. In the United States,
approximately more than 40,000 women will die of breast
cancer in 2015 [1]. Chemotherapeutics are a standard of
care in clinical oncology today due to their effectiveness
in reducing tumor burden and improving survival [2].
However, the disease often relapses, with only a 23%
5-year survival rate in these patients with breast cancer
[3–5].
Accumulating evidence suggests that a subset
of tumor cells capable of initiating new tumors, called
cancer stem cells (CSCs), are a major barrier for tumor
control in patients refractory to drug treatment [6–9].

cancers [15]. However, the association between CSCs
and cardamonin has not been reported. We recently
screened large numbers of small molecules and found that
cardamonin could modestly inhibit tumor growth while
effectively abrogating the breast CSC population that had
been enhanced after poly(I:C) treatment of breast cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo [16]. We further observed that
cardamonin could significantly inhibit the expression of
stem-marker genes in breast cancer cells. We therefore
postulated that cardamonin might selectively repress the
enrichment of breast CSCs induced by drug treatment and
enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatments.
In this report, we show that treatment with firstline chemotherapeutic drugs markedly enriches the breast
CSC subpopulation. We also demonstrate that cardamonin
selectively reduces the population of CSCs enriched by
first-line chemotherapeutic drugs in different types of breast
cancer cells. Furthermore, simultaneous use of cardamonin
and chemotherapeutic drugs also prevents the generation of
new CSCs. Cardamonin abolishes the phosphorylation of
NF-κB/IKBα and Stat3 and represses the up-regulation of
IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 cytokines induced by drug treatments.
Importantly, co-administration of cardamonin and the
chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin markedly retards tumor
growth while inhibiting CSC pools in a xenograft mouse
model. These findings provide a rationale and experimental
basis for the combinational use of tumor-shrinking drugs
and CSC-targeting agents in clinical settings.

patient and intra-tumor variability, we employed various
markers which have been used regularly in the field, such
as CD44high/CD24-/low expression, aldehyde dehydrogenase
1 (ALDH1), stem cell-associated genes and proteins, and
stem-cell associated histone modifier genes [23–26].
In comparison with the controls, exposure of SUM190 cells to three different drugs resulted in a 2–3 fold
increase in the CD44high/CD24-/low subpopulation (Figure
1A, flow cytometry). A significant up-regulation of
ALDH1 protein expression was also observed by Western
blot (Figure 1B). To exclude cell type-dependence,
we examined two additional breast cancer cell lines
phenotypically different from SUM190 (inflammatory
breast cancer cell line, invasive ductal carcinoma,
ER-PR-HER2-/+), including MCF-7 (invasive ductal
carcinoma, ER+PR+) and Cama-1 (adenocarcinoma,
ER+PR-, oncogenic mutations in PTEN and p53, inframe mutation in E-cadherin gene) [27]. As shown in
Figure 1A and 1B, significant increases in the CD44high/
CD24-/low subpopulation and ALDH1 expression were
also observed in these cell lines after treatment with
three individual drugs, indicating that the phenomenon
is not dependent on the type of tumor. Since
CD44high/CD24-/low and/or increases in ALDH1 have been
widely used in characterization of breast CSCs [23–26],
our results suggest that these chemotherapeutic drugs
enrich the breast CSC subpopulation.
To further characterize CSCs after drug treatment,
we assessed gene expression profiles. It has been shown
that introduction of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC
genes transformed non-tumorigenic MCF-10A mammary
epithelial cells into tumorigenic CD44+/CD24low cells with
CSC properties [28], indicative of the crucial roles of these
transcriptional factors in CSC development. Furthermore,
over-expression of SOX2, OCT4 or NANOG alone is
sufficient to enhance tumorigenesis in a mouse model [29–
32]; up-regulation of c-MYC has been reported to increase
the CSC fraction by 150-fold, enabling tumor formation and
serial propagation with as few as 500 cells [33]. We therefore
performed Q-PCR and found that drug treatment upregulated
the expression of these cancer stem cell-associated genes in
all three cell lines, including ALDH1, SOX2, c-MYC, OCT4,
and NANOG (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S2).
In addition to stem cell-associated genes, we also
found that the expression of stem cell-associated histone
modifier genes EZH2, SETDB1, SMYD3, and MLL1 was
elevated in drug-treated cells (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Figure S2). It is well known that disruption of the histone
modification patterns is one of the most common features
of human tumors [34]. For example, polycomb protein
EZH2 is essential in stem cell self-renewal and has been
shown to promote expansion of breast CSCs [35], histone
methyltransferase SETDB1 is a bona fide oncogene
and contributes to tumorigenesis [34], histone lysine
methyltransferase SMYD3 plays a pivotal role in the
regulation of oncogenic signaling [36], and MLL creates

RESULTS
Chemotherapeutic drugs enrich breast
CSC subpopulation
Among chemotherapeutic drugs used widely for
patients with breast cancers, 5-fluorouracil (targeting
thymidylate synthase and DNA synthesis), doxorubicin
(targeting topoisomerase II), and paclitaxel (targeting
cytoskeleton structure tubulin) are three well-defined
first-line agents [17, 18]. To test whether these first-line
chemotherapeutic drugs enrich breast CSCs, we treated
breast cancer cells with three individual drugs for 4d
followed by a 2d recovery, and then conducted subsequent
assays to determine presence and characteristics of CSCs
in the population in the absence of additional treatment
according to previously established procedures [7].
Drug concentrations used in this study were chosen
based on three factors: clinically relevant concentrations
[13, 19–22], titration determining approximately half
maximal inhibitory concentrations using SUM190, MCF7, and Cama-1 breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S1), and the potential to enrich breast CSCs.
We analyzed CSC properties by flow cytometry,
quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR), Western blot, and
mammosphere formation. Since a single marker is not
sufficient for characterization of CSC due to high interwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

epigenetic changes and maintains tumor propagating cells
in response to Wnt/β-catenin signaling [37].
Finally, as a functional measure of CSCs, we
performed mammosphere assays based on the ability
of breast CSCs to generate multicellular spheroids in
suspension culture [24, 38]. SUM190 cells were treated
with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, or paclitaxel for 4d and
recovered for 2d in the absence of drugs. The drug-treated
cells were then reseeded in an ultra-low 6-well plate (2000
cells/well) in the mammosphere-forming medium without
further drug treatment. After 8 days, SUM190 cells pretreated with drugs before reseeding formed approximately
2-fold more mammospheres than those pre-treated with
vehicle (Figure 1D). Moreover, the drug-treated tumor
cells grew faster and generated larger mammospheres than
the vehicle-treated counterparts. Collectively, these data
indicate that exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs leads
to enrichment of CSCs in different types of breast cancer
cells. This provides a basis for CSC-targeting therapy
concurrent with or following chemotherapy.

To understand cellular mechanisms underlying the
action of cardamonin, we asked whether cardamonin could
inhibit CSC enrichment by diminishing CSC properties or
by causing CSC death in sorted CD44high/CD24-/low CSCs.
We fractionated CD44high/CD24-/low CSC subpopulations
from SUM190 and MDA-MB-231 (ER-PR-HER2-)
breast cancer cell lines using fluorescence activated cell
sorting (Supplementary Figure S4). We then seeded CSC
subpopulations in ultra-low attachment plates and cultured
them in mammosphere formation media in the presence or
absence of cardamonin. This assay reflects the presence of
self-renewing, gland-reconstituting stem cells within the
population [25]. Notably, fractionated CSCs treated with
cardamonin formed smaller and fewer mammospheres than
those treated with the vehicle alone (Supplementary Figure
S4A), suggesting a reduced self-renewal capacity. We also
assessed the percentage of CSCs and non-CSCs in the
fractionated CD44high/CD24-/low subpopulation after vehicle
or cardamonin treatment. While cardamonin treatment led
to a 2-fold decrease in the CSC subpopulation compared
to the vehicle control, it caused insignificant CSC death
according to 7AAD staining in comparison to the vehicle
control (Supplementary Figure S4B). Fractionated CD44high/
CD24-/low CSCs from both SUM190 and MDA-MB231 cell
lines showed similar results (Supplementary Figure S4C).
Additionally, increases in gene expression levels associated
with CSCs (ALDH1, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) in
CD44high/CD24-/low subpopulations fractionated from both
SUM190 and MDA-MB231 cells were lower after treatment
with cardamonin (Supplementary Figure S4D). Taken
together, these results suggest that cardamonin reduces CSC
subpopulation through diminishing CSC properties instead
of enhancing CSC death, implicating that cardamonin
facilitates the conversion of breast CSCs to non-CSCs.

Cardamonin diminishes drug-selected CSCs
Our recent data showed that cardamonin inhibited
the expression of key CSC-marker genes induced by
inflammation [16]. We then asked whether cardamonin
could inhibit in vitro growth and tumorigenic potential
of breast CSCs that had survived after chemotherapeutic
drug treatments. We first performed soft agar colonyforming assays, a method commonly used for examination
of potential therapeutic agents in oncology [25, 39].
Notably, cardamonin resulted in a 2 to 3- fold decrease
in colony-forming capacity in all three cell lines tested
(Figure 2A). Since the ability to form mammosphere is a
prominent feature of CSCs [40], these results suggest that
cardamonin abrogates breast CSC function.
In the light of the above observations, we further
investigated the potential role of cardamonin in the drugselected breast cancer cells. After 4 days drug treatments,
remaining drug-tolerant cancer cells were further treated
with cardamonin or vehicle, and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Consistently, cardamonin treatment decreased
the CD44high/CD24-/low subpopulation by 2 to 3-fold in
drug-tolerant SUM190 cells and 3 to 4-fold in drugtolerant Cama-1 cells (Figure 2B). Cardamonin also downregulated the expression of stem-cell associated genes
ALDH1, SOX2, c-MYC, OCT4, and NANOG and stem
cell-associated histone modifier genes EZH2, SETDB1,
and SMYD3 in these drug-tolerant cells as determined
by Q-PCR (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S3).
Collectively, the results from soft agarose functional
assays, flow cytometry, and “stemness”-associated gene
expression analysis demonstrate that cardamonin abolishes
CSCs that have been enriched by chemotherapeutic drugs.
These results suggest that cardamonin could be used to
target breast CSCs after completion of chemotherapy.

Prevention of CSC enrichment when concurrent
use of chemotherapeutic drugs and cardamonin
Since cardamonin abolished chemotherapeutic
drug-selected CSCs (Figure 2), we asked whether
cardamonin could also prevent CSC enrichment when
used concurrently with chemotherapeutic drugs. We
treated SUM190 cells with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin,
or paclitaxel in the simultaneous absence or presence of
cardamonin. In contrast to the cells treated with vehicle
and grew as an adherent monolayer, SUM190 cells
treated with individual drugs alone formed adherent
mammosphere-like structures, which were effectively
inhibited by cardamonin (Figure 3A). Western blot
analysis showed that cells co-treated with cardamonin
and chemotherapeutic drugs significantly diminished the
up-regulation of ALDH1, c-MYC, and OCT4 proteins
associated with CSC phenotypes (Figure 3B).
We further analyzed CD44high/CD24-/low CSC
subpopulation using flow cytometry. Cardamonin almost
completely abolished the up-regulated CD44high/CD24-/low

subpopulation induced by concurrent addition of three
individual drugs in SUM190 and Cama-1 cells (Figure
3C). We also analyzed gene expression profiling
using Q-PCR. In comparison to the cells treated with
chemotherapeutic drugs alone, cardamonin inhibited the
expression of stem cell-associated genes ALDH1, SOX2,
c-MYC, OCT4, and NANOG as well as stem cell-associated
histone modifier genes EZH2, SETDB1, and SMYD3
(Figure 3D), suggesting that cardamonin sufficiently
prevents the enrichment of CSCs when simultaneously
used with chemotherapeutic drugs. Additionally,
emerging evidence has shown that histone modification
results in tumor cell plasticity and dynamic phenotypic
heterogeneity, which is an important determinant of the
effectiveness of chemotherapy [41, 42]. It is possible that
repression of some histone modifier genes will facilitate
chemotherapeutic efficacy.

and MCF-7 cells (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure
S5). Together, these results suggest a possible molecular
mechanism underlying inhibitory effects of cardamonin on
CSC enrichment induced by chemotherapeutic drugs.

Cardamonin enhances chemotherapeutic drug
efficacy in retardation of tumor growth while
reducing CSC subpopulation in vivo
To determine whether cardamonin exhibits similar
effects in vivo, we transplanted SUM190 cells into the
mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice. When the
tumor reached a mean diameter of 4 mm after 13 days
of implantation, mice were randomized into 4 groups and
injected intraperitoneally with vehicle, doxorubicin (6 mg/
kg on days 13, 18, and 23), cardamonin (25 mg/kg once
every other day from days 13) or a combination of both. As
shown in Figure 5A and 5B, treatment with doxorubicin
alone impeded tumor growth (p < 0.05) while treatment
with cardamonin alone only mildly hindered tumor growth
in comparison to control group (p > 0.05). Significantly,
the combination of doxorubicin and cardamonin markedly
reduced tumor burden in comparison to each of the other
three groups (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001, Figure 5A and 5B),
suggesting that cardamonin enhances chemotherapy
efficacy.
To
determine
whether
cardamonin
with
doxorubicin reduces the CSC pool in vivo, we harvested
tumors after three cycles of treatment and assessed the
CD44high/CD24-/low subpopulation using flow cytometry.
Notably, the CSC population in tumors harvested from
mice receiving doxorubicin alone increased 2.5-fold over
those receiving vehicle alone, although the tumor weights
were lower and sizes smaller (Figure 5C). In contrast, coadministration of cardamonin and doxorubicin not only
remarkably reduced the tumor growth but also abolished
doxorubicin-enriched CSCs in mouse xenografts (Figure 5C).
We further assessed the expression levels of
several “stemness” genes of xenografts. Tumors from
doxorubicin-treated mice showed higher levels of ALDH1,
SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG expression compared to vehicle
controls (Figure 5D). In contrast, co-administration of
cardamonin and doxorubicin almost completely abolished
doxorubicin-upregulated “stemness” genes (Figure 5D).
Thus, the key therapeutic advantage of cardamonin in
combination with conventional chemotherapy may be the
effective elimination of both the bulk of the tumor and
tumorigenic CSCs.

Cardamonin inhibits chemotherapeutic
drug-induced inflammatory cytokines and
NF-κB and Stat3 activation in breast cancer cells
Inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB and Stat3 activation
have been closely associated with cancer progression
and CSC development [16, 17, 43–46]. We therefore
determined whether chemotherapy drugs that led to CSC
enrichment (Figure 1) would enhance the expression of
inflammatory cytokines in breast cancer cells. Indeed,
gene expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and human monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were robustly elevated
and also correlated positively with progressively increased
CSC-marker genes in a time-dependent manner after
treatment with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and paclitaxel
(Figure 4A and 1C). Strikingly, cardamonin almost
completely abrogated chemotherapeutic drug-upregulated
transcription of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 (Figure 4B), and
also diminished protein expression of IL-6, IL-8, and
MCP-1 (Figure 4C). These results indicate that cardamonin
is capable of repressing key inflammatory cytokines
closely associated with the development of CSCs.
In addition, chemotherapeutic drug-treatment
augmented the activation (phosphorylation) of nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF-κB), nuclear factor of kappa light
polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha
(IκBα) and signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (Stat3) in a time-dependent manner, which was
also positively correlated with the increased CSCmarker proteins c-MYC and OCT4 (Figure 4D). This
observation is partially consistent with a report showing
that cardamonin inhibited NF-κB and IκB in macrophage
cells [47]. It is well known that activation of NF-κB and
Stat3 inflammatory pathways will upregulate the secretion
of various cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1
and promote the development of CSCs [16, 17, 43, 46].
Significantly, cardamonin abrogated chemotherapeutic
drug-induced activation of NF-κB and STAT3 in SUM190

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapeutic drug resistance represents one
of the major unmet clinical challenges in breast cancer
treatment. Recent studies have suggested that eradication
of breast CSCs that are resistant to chemotherapy is
required to achieve a complete remission and prevent

disease recurrence [7–9, 13, 41, 48]. In this study, we
demonstrate that different breast cancer cell lines after
treatment with clinically relevant concentrations of
5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, or paclitaxel enrich CSCs,
increase expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 cytokines,
and up-regulate activation of NF-κB and Stat3 pathways.
IL-6 and IL-8 play an essential role in breast
tumorigenesis, associate with poor patient survival, and
are implicated in the maintenance of breast CSCs and
chemotherapy resistance, particularly in basal subtype
and triple negative breast cancer [5, 49–51]. MCP-1 has
been found to enhance stem cell phenotypes and CSC selfrenewal in breast cancer [46], and facilitate the generation
of induced pluripotent stem cells [52]. It is also well
known that NF-κB and Stat3 pathways govern cytokine
productions in response to different stimuli, are associated
with drug resistance, and regulate tumor angiogenesis
and invasiveness [16, 44, 45, 50, 53–55]. Significantly,
our results show that cardamonin is capable of effectively
repressing IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 up-regulation and NFκB and Stat3 activation, suggesting a possible mechanism
underlying cardamonin inhibitory effects on CSC
enrichment induced by chemotherapeutic drugs.
Interestingly, our results also show that cardamonin
suppresses stem cell-associated histone modifier
genes EZH2, SETDB1, SMYD3, and MLL1 induced by
chemotherapeutic drugs (Figure 3D). Histone modification
plays an important role in tumor cell plasticity and
phenotypic heterogeneity [34–37, 56]. Our observation
that cardamonin facilitates the conversion of breast
CSCs to non-CSCs while insignificantly enhancing CSC
death may associate with its inhibitory effect on histone
modifiers. Particularly, EZH2 physically links β-catenin
on the target gene promoters of cyclin B1 and c-Myc
[57]. EZH2 has also been shown to promote expansion of
breast CSCs through activation of Erk-β-catenin signaling
[35]. Additionally, EZH2 activates the transcription of
NF-κB target genes by forming a ternary complex with
two NF-κB subunits in triple negative MDA-MB-231
cells [58]. As such, although it remains unknown whether
and to what extent inhibition of this histone modifier
by cardamonin is through repressing NF-kB and Stat3
signaling, it is possible that crosstalk between EZH2 (or
SETDB1, SMYD3, MLL1) and NF-κB and Stat3 might
be an important determinant in drug resistance in breast
cancer, warranting further investigation.
In conclusion, cardamonin suppresses existing breast
CSCs after chemotherapeutic drug treatments, prevents the
enrichment of new CSCs during chemotherapeutic drug
treatments, and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
drugs by reducing tumor burden as well as the CSC pool
in vivo. Cardamonin, which is found in many plant species
[15], seems to be a promising candidate in CSC-targeted
therapies either concurrently used with chemotherapeutic
drugs or after chemotherapeutic treatment.

Cell culture and reagents
Breast cancer cell line SUM190 were obtained from
Asterand (Detroit, MI,USA) and cultured in Hams F-12
media (Mediatech, Manassas, VA, USA) containing 5 μg/
ml insulin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, antibiotics (penicillin/
streptomycin), and 2% of fetal bovine serum (HyClone,
Logan, UT, USA). Medium for SUM190 cell culture was
further supplemented with 5 mM ethanolamine, 10 mM
HEPES, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.6 ng/ml 3,3',5-triiodo-Lthyronine sodium salt, 8.7 ng/ml sodium selenite, and 1 mg/
ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a
5% CO2 incubator. Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDAAB-231 and Cama-1 were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained
in DMEM-F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS). Doxorubicin hydrochloride, 5-fluorouracil,
paclitaxel, insulin, hydrocortisone, HEPES, and bovine
serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Cardamonin was purchased from
TOCRIS bioscience (Ellisville, MO, USA). B27 supplement
was purchased from Fisher (Cat. 17504-044), and EGF and
bFGF from RD (Cat. 236-EG-200 and 234-FSE).

Xenograft tumor growth
All mouse experimentation was conducted in
accordance with standard operating procedures approved
by the Animal Care Committee at the University of
Ottawa. Athymic nude mice (6–8 week old, female, 20
to 25 g body weight) were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories. To establish breast cancer xenografts in
nude mice, SUM190 cells were mixed with Matrigel
and injected under aseptic conditions into mammary fat
pads of nude mice (n = 4–8 for each group, 2 × 106 cells
per fat pad). The tumor was monitored and evaluated
every 2–3 days with calipers. Tumors were measured
in 2 dimensions, and volume was calculated according
to the formula: V = 0.5 ((length) × (width)2. When the
tumor reached a mean diameter of 4 mm (approximately
day 13), mice were randomized into 4 groups: vehicle
control, doxorubicin (6 mg/kg on days 13, 18, and 23),
cardamonin (25 mg/kg on every other day from days
13) or doxorubicin and cardamonin. At the end of drug
treatment, mice were humanely euthanized and tumors
were harvested and measured (weight and volume).
Xenografted tumors were further analyzed by flow
cytometry and Q-PCR.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cancer cells dissociated from transplanted
tumor tissues or from culture plates were counted
and re-suspended in 100 μl of HBSS containing 2%

780

Oncotarget

heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFS) and 105 cells.
Five microliters of mouse IgG solution (1 mg/ml) was
added and incubated on ice for 10 min. According to the
manufacturer’s recommendation, appropriate antibodies
were added and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells
were then washed twice with HIFS and re-suspended in
0.2 ml of HIFS that contained 7-aminoactinomycin D
(7AAD, 1 μg/ml, final concentration) to exclude dead
cells. Appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated isotype
matched antibodies were used as negative controls.
Antibodies used were anti-CD44 (APC), anti-CD24
(PE), which were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Flow
cytometry was performed on a Cyan-ADP 9 and data
analyzed with Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter, USA).

Cama-1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of
cardamonin, incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 17 days
to allow colony formation. Cell viability was determined
by staining with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 1 mg/ml). Colonies
(>100 μm in diameter) of each cell line were counted. All
experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are
presented as means ± SD.

Western blot analysis
For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested
and lysates prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma) and subcellular fractions prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear
Protein Extraction Kit (Thermo Scientific) containing
protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany). Protein concentration was determined using
a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). Subsequently, 25 μg–30 μg of total protein for each
sample was loaded onto an 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel for electrophoresis and then transferred to a PVDF
membrane. Protein was identified by incubating the
membrane with primary antibodies, followed by
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
and an enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Pierce,
Thermo Scientific, USA). Antibodies used in this study
include: anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody (D84C12, Cat.
5605), anti-phospho-Stat3(Tyr705) monoclonal antibody
(1:1000, D3A7, Cat. 9145), anti-Stat3 monoclonal
antibody (1:1000,124H6, Cat. 9139) from Cell Signaling
(Danvers, MA, USA); anti-ALDH1A1 antibody (1:1000,
ab105920), anti-OCT4 antibody (1:1000, ab137427)
from ABCAM (Cambridge, MA,USA); anti-α-tubulin
monoclonal antibody (T9026) from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA); anti-NF-κB p65 monoclonal antibody
(1:1000, 112A1021), anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 pSer 536
monoclonal antibody (1:1000, T.849.2), anti-I-kappaB-alpha monoclonal antibody (1:1000, T.937.7), and
anti-phospho-I-kappa-B-alpha pSer32/36 monoclonal
antibody (1:1000, H.709.9) from Thermo scientific
(Rockford, USA).

Fractionation of CSC and non-CSC
subpopulations from breast cancer cells
To separate CSCs from non-CSCs (SUM190 and
MDA-MB-231 cell lines), single-cell suspensions were
stained with CD44 antibody (APC-conjugated) and CD24
antibody (PE-conjugated) for 30 min, analyzed and sorted
by MoFlo Astrios - Sorter (Beckman Coulter). Isolation
gates, including histogram markers and dot plot quadrants,
were set based on respective IgG isotype controls. Purity
was determined immediately after sorting and was
approximately >90%. CSCs are defined by CD44high/
CD24−/low subpopulation, whereas non-CSCs are defined
by CD44−/low/CD24high subpopulation. CSCs were reseeded
on ultralow-attachment plates and cultured in DMEM/F12
medium containing B27 supplement, 20 ng/ml of EGF, and
20 ng/ml of basic FGF. Plates were incubated at 37°C in
5% CO2 to allow mammosphere formation in the presence
or absence of cardamonin followed by mammosphere
formation assays, qPCR and flow cytometry analyses.

Mammosphere formation assays
SUM190 cells were treated with vehicle control,
5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, or paclitaxel for 4d, and
then allowed to recover in the absence of treatment for
2 days. The cells (2 × 103/well) were reseeded in ultralow
attachment plate in sphere medium (DMEM/F12 medium
containing B27 supplement, 20 ng/ml of EGF and 20 ng/
ml of basic FGF). The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5%
CO2 for 8 days to allow mammosphere formation. Colonies
(>100 μm in diameter) of each groups were counted.

Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR)
Total RNAs were extracted using RNeasy kit
(QIAGEN) and real-time Q-PCR analysis was performed
using Bio-Rad MyiQ (Bio-Rad, USA) as previously
described [59]. The conditions for Q-PCR reactions are:
one cycle at 95°C for 20 seconds, followed by 40 cycles at
95°C for 3 seconds and annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds.
Results were normalized to the housekeeping gene
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Relative expression level of genes from different groups
were calculated with the 2ΔΔCT method and compared with
the expression level of the corresponding gene in control
cells. The primers used were listed in Table 1.

Soft agar colony formation
A soft-agar assay was performed on 12-well
plates with a base layer of 0.5% agarose gel containing
DMEM. To generate the cell layer, 5 × 103 cells/well
were suspended in 0.35% top agarose gel in DMEM/
F12 medium containing B27 supplement, 20 ng/ml of
EGF and 20 ng/ml of basic FGF. SUM190, MCF-7, and

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

Half maximal inhibitory concentration of
chemotherapeutic drugs

We thank Dr. Jonathan Lee for providing some
experimental materials. We apologize to all those
colleagues whose important work not being cited.
This work is supported by operating grants from
Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation-Ontario Region and
the Canadian Institutes of Health Research MOP-111224
to LW.

To titrate the half maximal inhibitory concentration
of each chemotherapeutic drug, 2000 cells per well were
seeded into 96-well plates for each cell line. One day
after seeding, drugs were added in five replicates for
each concentration. After 4d, MTT reagent (tetrazolium)
was added for 4 h and the reaction was stopped by
removing MTT and adding DMSO (150 μL) to each well
to dissolve formazan crystals. Absorbance was measured
at 570 nm.
