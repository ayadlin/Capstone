ABSTRACT
Oncogenic NRAS mutations are frequent in melanoma and lead to increased
downstream signaling and uncontrolled cell proliferation. Since the direct inhibition
of NRAS is not possible yet, modulators of NRAS posttranslational modifications have
become an area of interest. Specifically, interfering with NRAS posttranslational
palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle could disturb proper NRAS localization, and
therefore decrease cell proliferation and downstream signaling. Here, we investigate
the expression and function of NRAS depalmitoylating acyl protein thioesterases 1
and 2 (APT-1, APT-2) in a panel of NRAS mutant melanoma cells. First, we show
that all melanoma cell lines examined express APT-1 and APT-2. Next, we show that
siRNA mediated APT-1 and APT-2 knock down and that the specific APT-1 and -2
inhibitors ML348 and ML349 have no biologically significant effects in NRAS mutant
melanoma cells. Finally, we test the dual APT-1 and APT-2 inhibitor palmostatin B
and conclude that palmostatin B has effects on NRAS downstream signaling and
cell viability in NRAS mutant melanoma cells, offering an interesting starting point
for future studies.

with BRAF mutant melanoma [8,9]. On the other hand,
attempts to directly block NRAS have not been successful
so far and patients with these mutations have a worse
prognosis [10]. The inhibition of components of NRAS’s
downstream cascades has shown promising data in vitro
but inconsistent results in patients [11–17]. Oncogenic
NRAS mutations occur not only in melanoma, but also in
a variety of other cancers, which further emphasizes the
need for studies on substances that interfere with NRAS
signaling [18,19].
NRAS and its close homolog, Harvey rat sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog (HRAS), belong to the family
of small GTPases. Under normal conditions, the proteins
connect membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) to intracellular signaling networks and are

INTRODUCTION
Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer
with rising incidence [1]. Early stage melanomas can be
cured by surgical excision, but the metastatic disease still
has a very poor outcome.
In melanoma, driving oncogenic mutations in
v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B
(BRAF) and neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog (NRAS) are found in about 40% and 20%
of tumors, respectively [2–4]. These mutations lead to
excessive downstream signaling, increased cell growth
and uncontrolled proliferation [5–7]. BRAF inhibitors

critical regulators of cell fate and cell cycle progression.
Oncogenic mutations lock the proteins in their active, GTP
bound state and cause continuous downstream signaling,
promoting cell division and tumor growth [6,20,21].
Interestingly, NRAS and HRAS signaling, depends upon
their intracellular localization; therefore, interfering with
this localization has the potential of modulating RAS
activity [22–24].
The proper NRAS and HRAS plasma membrane
localization is regulated by the addition of palmitic acids
to the C-terminus of the proteins (palmitoylation). The
palmitoylation occurs in the Golgi apparatus and the
palmitoylated proteins travel to the plasma membrane
where they bind their signaling partners. On the plasma
membrane the proteins are then depalmitoylated and
recycle back to the Golgi apparatus. This dynamic cycle is
tightly regulated by palmitoyl transferases (palmitoyaltion)
and acyl protein thioesterases 1 and 2 (APT-1, APT-2)
(depalmitoylation) [24,25]. Consequently, these enzymes
are potential therapeutic targets in cells with hyperactive
NRAS or HRAS signaling. The recently developed APT1 and -2 inhibitor palmostatin B selectively inhibited the
growth of NRASG12D mutant hematopoietic cells and
HRASG12V transformed fibroblasts by disturbing NRAS and
HRAS localization to down-regulate RAS signaling [26,27].
Based on these encouraging results we hypothesized that
interference with APT-1 and APT-2 function might be
beneficial in NRAS mutant melanoma, for which FDA
approved targeted therapies are still lacking.
Here, we investigate APT-1 and APT-2 expression
and function in a panel of NRAS mutant melanoma cell
lines. We show that siRNA mediated knockdown or
their inhibition with highly specific inhibitors ML348
and ML349 does not down-regulate NRAS signaling or
decrease cell viability. In contrast, palmostatin B showed
a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability in a panel of
NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines.

Acyl protein thioesterases APT-1 and APT-2 are
expressed in melanoma cell lines
Inhibition of acyl protein thioesterases 1 and 2
(APT-1, APT-2) interferes with NRAS localization and
cell growth in NRAS mutant hematopoietic cells, but
the function of the proteins in NRAS mutant melanoma
is unknown [27]. To elucidate the role of the two close
homologs APT-1 and APT-2, we selected a panel of NRAS
mutant melanoma cell lines based on their previously
characterized NRAS mutations in exons II and III and
compared them to the BRAF mutant line SK-MEL-28,
which also hyper-activates the MAPK pathway through
BRAFV600E but not through mutant NRAS [12,13,28,29].
First, we analyzed APT-1 and APT-2 protein expression.
Both proteins were ubiquitously expressed in all cell lines
examined, albeit at different levels (Figure 1).

APT-1 and APT-2 knock down in NRAS mutant
melanoma does not alter cell viability or NRAS
downstream signaling
Since all cell lines expressed both proteins and their
inhibition has the potential to suppress mutant NRAS
function in melanoma, we utilized siRNA to knock down
APT-1 and APT-2. Because both homologs (65% sequence
identity) can depalmitoylate NRAS, we also studied the
dual knock down of APT-1 and 2 [25]. We confirmed and
quantified the protein knock down, and evaluated the main
NRAS downstream cascades, which are important for
survival and growth in NRAS mutant cancer [11,30,31].
After APT-1 and APT-2 knock down the phosphorylation
of NRAS down streamers ERK and AKT remained
unchanged in NRAS mutant melanoma cells (Figure 2).
In line with this, partial siRNA mediated knock down

at room temperature (<12.5 μM) [32,33]. ML348 and
ML349 did not decrease cell viability, but they led to a
slight activation of AKT in NRAS mutant cells, while no
such effect was seen in the BRAF mutant SK-MEL-28
(Figure 3). No effects were observed on the main NRAS
effector p-ERK.

with farnesyltransferase inhibitors showed potent target
inhibition with little associated cytotoxicity [37,38]. Yet,
phase II clinical trials had to be aborted because none of
the enrolled patients showed clinical response[39].
Recent reports show that the pharmacological
interference of the dynamic HRAS and NRAS
palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle through inhibition
of APT-1 and -2 selectively reduces growth and signaling
in cells with oncogenic HRAS or NRAS mutations
[26,27]. Here, we test if this also applies to NRAS mutant
melanoma, where such mutations are found in 20% of
tumors and treatment options are limited [40].
The NRAS depalmitoylating enzymes APT-1 and
2 could be potential targets in NRAS mutant melanoma
as they regulate the subcellular localization of NRAS,
which in turn affects its downstream signaling. Our
study shows that all tested melanoma cell lines express
both proteins, albeit at different levels (Figure 1). These
results are consistent with published mRNA expression
data, where all 61 melanoma cell lines tested expressed
mRNA for both proteins, underlining their importance for
cell survival [28]. To our knowledge there are no reports
on APT-1 and -2 functions in NRAS mutant melanoma.
To examine the biological function of APT-1 and -2
in NRAS dependent cell growth and signaling, we knocked
down both proteins using siRNA. For our experiments we
chose a panel of melanoma cells with activating NRAS
mutations in codons 12 and 61, which we compared to
a BRAFV600 mutant and NRAS wild type melanoma cell
line. To our surprise, siRNA mediated APT-1, APT-2, or
dual knock down did not decrease cell viability or affect
the major NRAS downstream effectors (Figure 2).
As the siRNA did not completely abolish APT-1
and 2 we used newly synthesized APT-1 and 2 inhibitors
ML348 and ML349, which have very strong substrate
inhibition. These compounds were specifically designed
for studying these proteins and their specificity and in vivo
APT-1 and 2 inhibition has been confirmed in previous
studies [32,33]. ML348 and ML349 did not cause any
decrease in cell viability or consistent changes in the main
NRAS down streamers ERK and AKT. Though higher
concentrations of the two compounds might affect cell
biology, the use of ML348 and ML349 in supplemented
media is limited by drug solubility. On the other hand, both
compounds showed very high and selective bioactivity
scores at 5 μM in HEK293T cells and we expect that
similar substrate inhibition is achieved in melanoma cells
[41]. ML348 and ML349’s lack of significant effects are in
line with our siRNA studies and suggest a negligible effect
of APT-1 and 2 inhibition in NRAS mutant melanoma
growth and downstream signaling.
To further investigate roles of APT-1 and -2 in
NRAS mutant melanoma, we tested another newly
developed drug, palmostatin B. Its different chemical
structure may render it less specific, compared to
ML349 and ML349 [32,42]. However, it is the only

The APT-1 and APT-2 inhibitor palmostatin
B decreases cell viability in NRAS mutant
melanoma cell lines
Palmostatin B is another recently developed APT
inhibitor. In previous studies it selectively decreased cell
growth in NRAS mutant, but not in KRAS mutant or
wild type cells in dosages of up to 100 μM. Palmostatin
B primarily inhibits APT-1 and APT-2, but may have
off target effects on other serine hydrolases [25–27,32].
We tested the drug on our melanoma cell panel and at
dosages similar to previous reports. In contrast to ML348
and ML349, palmostatin B led to a dose dependent cell
viability decrease in most NRAS mutant cell lines, while
no significant cell viability decrease was observed in the
BRAF mutant cell line SK-MEL-28 (Figure 4). The GI50
values (concentrations of drugs resulting in 50% decrease
in cell viability relative to DMSO treated controls)
ranged from 9.93 μM for the cell line WM3670 to >100
μM for MM415 and the BRAF mutant SK-MEL-28
(Supplementary Table S1).
Next, we selected cell lines that had significant
decreases in cell viability after palmostatin B incubation
and studied the induction of apoptosis or necrosis via
Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining followed by flow
cytometry. The apoptosis assays were in line with the
CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assays used for the dose response
curves, and revealed that palmostatin B leads to dosedependent cell death in NRAS mutant cell lines WM3670
and SK-MEL-2, but not in the BRAF mutant cell line
SK-MEL-28 (Figure 4). In contrast to ML348 and
ML349, palmostatin B caused a dose-dependent decrease
in phosphorylation of the main NRAS downstream
effectors ERK and S6 (Figure 4). The induction of AKT
phosphorylation in WM3670 and Sk-MEL-28 by APT
inhibition with palmostatin B can be explained by the
decrease of the negative feedback mechanisms exerted
through less active ERK in some cell lines [34–36].

DISCUSSION
RAS proteins are important regulators of cell fate
and up to 30% of all cancers have driving mutations in
KRAS, HRAS or NRAS [20]. So far, efforts to design
and deliver specific inhibitors of mutant RAS in vivo
have failed and new approaches to treat RAS mutant
cancer are needed. Targeting the post-translational
modification of RAS mutant melanoma is not a novelty:
more than a decade ago in vitro and in vivo mouse studies

APT inhibitor that has shown effects on cell viability
and RAS downstream signaling in HRAS and NRAS
mutant cells [26]. The drug resulted in a dose-dependent
cell viability decrease in all NRAS mutant cell lines
tested. Interestingly, the effect was significantly more
pronounced in cells with NRAS mutations in exon II
(codon G12) than in exon III (codon Q61) (p <.05, MannWhitney-U test), where the GI50 values were lower and
comparable to previous reports in other NRASG12 mutant
cells [26,42]. This finding might be explained by the fact
that NRASQ61 mutant proteins have decreased GTPase
activity and increased stability compared to NRASG12
mutants, leading to more active, GTP-bound protein
in cells with NRASQ61 mutations [43]. It is tempting to
speculate whether cells with mutations in NRASG12 might
be more prone to interference of NRAS localization, as the
overall downstream signaling is weaker. In agreement with
the cell viability decrease we observed a dose dependent
reduction of main NRAS downstream signaling effectors
p-ERK and p-S6 (Figure 4). Our results are supported by
previous studies which show that palmostatin B mediated
inhibition of APT-1 and -2 affects HRASG12 transformed
fibroblasts, NRASG12 transformed fetal liver cells and
NRAS mutant leukemia cells [26,42]. To our knowledge
this is the first report of APT-1 and APT-2 inhibitor
activity in NRAS mutant melanoma cells. Still, before we
can estimate palmostatin Bs’ real potential in the treatment
of NRAS mutant melanoma, further in vivo studies are
needed and warranted. As there are no data so far about
the pharmacokinetics of palmostatin B, first its oral and
intravenous bioavailability should be measured and serum
drug concentrations should be quantified. After finding the
right dose regimen and its lethal dose in mice, melanoma
xenograft models would offer a good platform for first
tests of palmostatin B in vivo action.
In summary, we did not observe biologically
significant effects on cell growth and NRAS signaling
following specific APT-1 and/or APT-2 inhibition in
a panel of NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines using
siRNA and the specific inhibitors ML348 and ML349.
Palmostatin B, however, decreased NRAS downstream
signaling and cell viability, but the moderate micro molar
dosages may have off-target effects. So far no in vivo
studies have been performed but the first palmostatin B
results in NRAS mutant melanoma are promising and
warrant further studies evaluating if and to what extent
palmostatin B interferes with NRAS localization in NRAS
mutant melanoma.

Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Luminescence was measured on the SynergyHT
plate reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA) using Gen5 software
(Version 1.11.5). For apoptotic assays 0.1–0.2 × 106 cells
were plated in 12-well plates and treated with DMSO or
an inhibitor. After 72 hours apoptosis was assessed using
the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V Alexa Fluor
488 and Propidium Iodide according to the manufacturer’s

siRNA experiments
For siRNA studies cells were plated in 96 well plates
(3–5 × 103/well) or 60mm dishes (0.8 – 1.4 × 106/dish).
After 24 hours cells were transfected with SMARTpool
siRNA directed against LYPLA1 or LYPLA2, both
