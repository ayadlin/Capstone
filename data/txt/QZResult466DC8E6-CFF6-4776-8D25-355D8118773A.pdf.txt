BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-dependent signaling represents a potential mechanism of resistance to therapy with epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is mediated in part through an EGFR-independent activation of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 promotes downregulation of E
cadherin and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The current study investigated EGFR and COX-2 inhibition in patients with non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and elevated baseline urinary metabolite of PGE2 (PGEM). METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV (AJCC 6th edition)
NSCLC who progressed after at least 1 line of therapy or refused standard chemotherapy were randomized to receive erlotinib and
celecoxib versus erlotinib and placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) with 80% power to detect a 50%
improvement with a 1-sided significance level of .2 in the intent-to-treat and elevated baseline PGEM populations. Secondary endpoints included response rate, overall survival, and evaluation of molecular markers to assess targeting COX-2–related pathways and
evaluate EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were enrolled with comparable baseline characteristics. Among the patients treated with celecoxib, those with wild-type EGFR were found to have an increased PFS (3.2 months vs
1.8 months; P 5.03). PFS was numerically improved among patients in the intent-to-treat group who received erlotinib and celecoxib
compared with those treated with erlotinib and placebo (5.4 months vs 3.5 months; P 5.33) and was increased in patients in the erlotinib and celecoxib arm with elevated baseline PGEM (5.4 months vs 2.2 months; P 5.15). Adverse events were similar in both treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of erlotinib and celecoxib did not appear to improve outcomes in an unselected
population, but selection by elevated baseline PGEM led to an increase in PFS with this combination. Patients with EGFR wild-type

INTRODUCTION
Therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provides significant benefit for
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations.1,2 Patients with wild-type
EGFR are reported to experience limited improvement with EGFR TKI therapy.3
Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and
thromboxanes. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) can be upregulated in response to growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters,
and other stimuli, and is constitutively overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, including NSCLC.4 Signaling through
the COX-2 pathway presents a novel mechanism of resistance to EGFR TKI therapy in patients with NSCLC. This resistance is mediated through an EGFR-independent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular

signal-regulated kinase (Erk) by the COX-2 metabolite
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),5 in addition to the promotion
of epithelial to mesenchymal transition through the downregulation of E-cadherin expression.6
Urinary 11a-hydroxy-9,15-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranorprostane-1,20-dioic acid is a metabolite of PGE2
(PGEM) and can be used as a surrogate for tumor levels of
PGE2.7 Decreases in PGEM in urine have been shown to
correlate with improvement in time to tumor progression
and overall survival (OS).7-9
The combination of EGFR and COX-2 inhibition
may potentiate responses in patients with NSCLC. In a
phase 1 trial, the optimal dose of celecoxib when combined
with erlotinib was determined to be 600 mg twice daily,
with manageable toxicity and tumor responses reported in
patients with both mutated and wild-type EGFR status.10
We hypothesized that interfering with trans-activating and
downstream pathways through the use of combination
COX-2 and EGFR inhibition can enhance the efficacy of
clinically tolerable doses of EGFR TKIs. The current study
investigated the combination of high-dose celecoxib and
erlotinib in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial
in patients with advanced NSCLC. A preplanned analysis
evaluating the association between baseline urine PGEM
and clinical outcome based on treatment was performed.

Services by each site. The study was conducted according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before study participation.
Study Design and Treatment

This phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial randomized patients in a 1:1 ratio using a random
permuted block design with stratification by smoking status (nonsmoker [<100 cigarettes smoked in lifetime] vs
current/former smoker) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1). Patients received
erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg orally daily plus placebo in
the control arm (arm A) or high-dose celecoxib at a dose of
600 mg orally twice daily plus erlotinib in the combination
treatment arm (arm B) continuously for a 28-day cycle.
The combination of erlotinib and celecoxib or erlotinib
and placebo was given for up to 12 months; after that time,
the patient discontinued the combination with celecoxib or
placebo and continued treatment with erlotinib alone until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose reductions for erlotinib were allowed to 100 mg daily (no dose
reduction was permitted for celecoxib), and dosing for either or both drugs could be interrupted for up to 14 days.
The current study has ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT00499655.
Assessments

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Eligible patients had to be aged >18 years with confirmed
stage IIIB or IV (AJCC 6th edition) NSCLC and tumor
tissue available for mutation analysis; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1;
have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); have progressive
disease despite having received 1 prior chemotherapy
regimens or the subject’s refusal or inability to receive
standard chemotherapy; and have adequate hematologic,
renal, and liver function. Key exclusion criteria included a
prior history of EGFR or COX-2 inhibitor therapy for
the treatment of cancer; previous history of gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, or perforation; concurrent use of
COX-2 inhibitors or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (low-dose aspirin was not allowed); active central
nervous system metastasis; or any history of myocardial
infarction or cerebral vascular accident or a major medical
condition that would interfere with participation in the
study. The study was approved by independent ethics
review boards and in accord with an assurance filed with
and approved by the Department of Health and Human
Cancer

September 15, 2015

Radiographic assessments for tumor measurement were
obtained every 8 weeks (2 cycles) to evaluate progressionfree survival (PFS), OS, the objective response rate, and
the disease control rate. Assessment of disease status was
performed by the investigators as per RECIST (version
1.0). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed as per the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Biomarker Evaluation
Urine PGEM measurement

Urine samples were analyzed in a blinded manner by
G.L.M. Twenty-four–hour urine samples were collected
at baseline, at week 4, and at week 8 of the study. Each
specimen was aliquoted and stored at 2808C. Urinary
PGEM levels were measured by mass spectrometry as previously described (normal levels were 10 ng/mg of creatinine in men and 6 ng/mg of creatinine in women).11,12

embedded archival tumor specimens were submitted.
Slides were reviewed by a board-certified pathologist who
demarcated areas of tumor for dissection. Needle microdissection was performed under a microscope, taking 2
representative areas from the region demarcated by the
pathologist. These areas were digested overnight. Each
dissected area was analyzed independently. Exons 18 to
21 of the EGFR gene were amplified from the digested
products by polymerase chain reaction. Negative controls
were included to rule out contamination. The amplified
products were directly sequenced using an automated fluorescence sequencing kit and sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). The chromatogram data were
then reviewed for changes and reported.

centage of patients with low urinary PGEM in the current
analysis. This improved the power of the analysis, under
the hypothesis that celecoxib will add benefit to erlotinib
therapy when patients have elevated baseline urinary PGEM
levels (COX-2 pathway activation), from 82% to 85%.
The median PFS and OS were estimated from
Kaplan-Meier curves. Comparison between treatment
arms was made using the log-rank test. HRs and 95%
confidence interval (95% CIs) were estimated using a Cox
regression model. Subgroup analyses for EGFR mutation,
COX-2 expression, and E-cadherin expression were performed, and a P value <.05 was considered to be statistically significant, but was not adjusted for multiple testing.
RESULTS

Immunohistochemistry

Patients

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tumor specimens were submitted to the University of California at
Los Angeles pathology core. COX-2 and E-cadherin
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as previously described.6 Each slide was assessed for the following:
1) percentage of cells positive for each stain (E-cadherin
and COX-2); 2) intensity of staining (0 to 3); 3) pattern
of staining (membranous, cytoplasmic, or nuclear); and
4) in slides that had double staining, the percentage of
cells that demonstrated coexpression of both antigens
(E-cadherin and COX-2). A staining intensity of 2 was
considered positive.

A total of 109 patients were randomized to receive either
erlotinib and placebo (54 patients) or erlotinib and celecoxib (55 patients) from November 2007 through May
2011 at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center
and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and a total of 107 patients received at least 1 dose of
the study drug (Fig. 1). One patient in each treatment
arm did not receive the study drug as planned and these
patients were excluded from the analysis. The median
follow-up was 12.1 months.
Characteristics at baseline were well balanced
between the treatment arms (Table 1), including patients
with EGFR mutations and baseline urinary PGEM levels.
Twenty-three patients (21%) had insufficient tissue for
mutation analysis (12 in the group treated with erlotinib
and placebo and 11 in the group treated with erlotinib
and celecoxib). Eighteen patients (17%) did not have
adequate urine for baseline urinary PGEM assessment (8
patients in the group treated with erlotinib and placebo
and 10 patients in the group treated with erlotinib and
celecoxib).

Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint of the current study was PFS in
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, and a second primary endpoint was added in May 2010 to evaluate
PFS in patients with elevated baseline urinary PGEM.
Secondary endpoints included response rate, OS, correlation of PFS with urinary PGEM and EGFR mutation
status, and measurement of COX-2 and E-cadherin
expression. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression by RECIST. The initial
sample size was 86 patients with a total number of 67
events required; the log-rank test of equality of survival
curves with a 1-sided significance level of .2 would
have 80% power to detect the difference between the
combination therapy-associated exponential parameter
of 0.22 (median PFS, 3.2 months) and the singleagent erlotinib exponential parameter of 0.33 (median
PFS, 2.1 months), corresponding to a constant hazard
ratio (HR) of 0.66.
The second primary endpoint increased the sample
size by 20 patients (to 106 patients) to account for the per3300

Efficacy

In the ITT population, PFS was numerically higher in the
patients treated with erlotinib plus celecoxib compared
with those treated with erlotinib plus placebo, although
this difference did not reach statistical significance (median, 5.4 months vs 3.5 months; HR, 0.82 [P 5.33])
(Fig. 2A). In patients selected with elevated baseline
PGEM, an improvement in PFS was demonstrated (median, 5.4 months vs 2.2 months; HR, 0.67 [P 5.15])
(Fig. 2C). Those patients with low baseline PGEM did
not benefit from combination treatment with celecoxib
(Fig. 2D). Analysis by EGFR mutation status revealed that

patients with wild-type tumors had an improvement
in PFS (median, 3.2 months vs 1.8 months; HR, 0.54
[P 5.03]) (Fig. 2B). Those with EGFR mutations or
unavailable results did not experience an improvement in
PFS (Table 2). In an exploratory analysis of patients with
wild-type EGFR and elevated PGEM at baseline, PFS was
longer for those in the group treated with erlotinib and
celecoxib (median, 3.8 months vs 1.8 months; HR, 0.42
[P 5.04]) and OS was similar in each group (median,
11.1 months vs 12.3 months; HR, 0.58 [P 5.22]) (data
not shown).
A trend toward improved OS was noted in the ITT
population (Fig. 3A) and in those with elevated baseline
PGEM (Fig. 3C). Patients with low baseline PGEM did
not experience improved OS (Fig. 3D). Survival was
found to be similar by treatment group regardless of
EGFR mutation status (Fig. 3B).
Safety

All 107 patients who received at least 1 dose of the study
drug were assessed for safety. The rate of discontinuation
due to AEs was similar in the group treated with erlotinib
and celecoxib and the group treated with erlotinib and
placebo (13.0% vs 11.3%). The most frequent cause for
3302

treatment discontinuation was disease progression in both
groups.
The most common AEs (all grades) in both groups
were rash, diarrhea, dry skin, fatigue, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase and did not differ significantly
between groups (Table 3). Anemia (33% vs 15%), elevated creatinine (32% vs 15%), and paronychia (30% vs
13%) occurred more often in the patients who received
erlotinib plus celecoxib. Two patients who received erlotinib plus celecoxib experienced cerebrovascular ischemia
(grade 2 and grade 3, respectively) and 1 patient on the
erlotinib plus placebo arm experienced grade 2 cardiac ischemia. No deaths were attributed to treatment.
Biomarker Assessment

Thirty-six patients (44%) had tissue available for the evaluation of COX-2 by IHC; 13 patients (68.4%) in the
group treated with erlotinib plus celecoxib and 12 patients
(70.6%) in the group treated with erlotinib plus placebo
demonstrated high expression. Due to small numbers,
this finding did not correlate with patient outcome. In
addition, 35 patients had available tissue for E-cadherin
assessment with elevated expression noted in 15 patients
(83.3%) in the group treated with erlotinib plus celecoxib

DISCUSSION
First described as being overexpressed in human NSCLC
in 1998,13 COX-2 contributes to multiple aspects of the
malignant phenotype, including angiogenesis,14 invasion,15 apoptosis resistance,16 and immune dysregulation.17-19 Information regarding the selection of patients
for COX-2 inhibitor therapy has matured, and it is clear
that a method of selection will improve our ability to
determine efficacy with the combination. Two methods
for the selection of COX-2 inhibitors are evaluation of
COX-2 expression by IHC and PGEM. IHC was initially
shown to potentially predict those patients who could
benefit from the combination of COX inhibition with
chemotherapy,20 but a phase 3 trial did not confirm these
results.21 Due to the variability in COX-2 expression by
IHC and limited tissue availability, we chose to evaluate
PGEM as a selective marker. PFS in patients with elevated
baseline PGEM levels was found to be higher among
patients treated with erlotinib plus celecoxib, and met our
primary endpoint in this population. This suggests that
baseline PGEM may identify a subgroup of patients with
activation of the COX-2 pathway who may be responsive
to therapy with celecoxib.
Several studies have evaluated COX-2 and EGFR
inhibition in small, unselected patient populations with
limited benefit.22-25 Gadgeel et al24 reported a phase 2
study of gefitinib and celecoxib in patients with platinum3304

refractory NSCLC. Patients received gefitinib at a dose of
250 mg daily and celecoxib at a dose of 400 mg twice
daily. The response rate to the combination of celecoxib
and gefitinib was similar to that observed with gefitinib
alone. O’Byrne et al25 reported combination therapy with
gefitinib and rofecoxib in patients with recurrent NSCLC
who were pretreated with a platinum agent. Gefitinib
combined with rofecoxib was found to provide disease
control equivalent to that expected with single-agent gefitinib and was generally well tolerated. Fidler et al23 evaluated the combination of erlotinib plus celecoxib in a
phase 2 trial of 26 patients with advanced NSCLC who
had failed 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and found that
10 of these patients achieved disease control and elevated
COX-2 expression by IHC was associated with improved
PFS. The results of the current study help to improve our
understanding of these combinations for the treatment of
patients with NSCLC. The prior studies did not dose
COX-2 inhibition to adequately block COX-2 activity
and induce antitumor effects, whereas high-dose celecoxib
was based on a decline in PGEM levels in our phase 1
trial.10 The use of adequate COX-2 inhibition along with
patient selection may optimize the use of this therapy.
A randomized phase 2 trial with a novel COX-2 inhibitor, apricoxib, in combination with erlotinib used a
run-in period to assess a decline in PGEM as a criteria for
eligibility.26 This was based on dosing from a phase 1 trial
that demonstrated at least a 50% reduction in PGEM.9
The authors randomized 120 patients and found a median time to disease progression of 1.8 months among the
patients treated with apricoxib and erlotinib versus 2.1
months in those treated with erlotinib and placebo. When
subgroups were evaluated, patients aged 65 years had a
significant improvement in time to disease progression
with the combination of apricoxib and erlotinib. This was
a unique design that attempted to identify those patients
who could benefit from COX-2 blockage, although a
higher cutpoint for a decline in PGEM may have been
more beneficial, as demonstrated by earlier studies.7,10
Although clinical benefit has been demonstrated
with erlotinib in patients with wild-type EGFR,27 to the
best of our knowledge responses are limited and patients
have better outcomes with chemotherapy when compared
with EGFR-directed treatment.3 Attempts to overcome
resistance with pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors have not resulted in better outcomes for
patients with wild-type EGFR.28,29 Patients with wildtype EGFR experienced a significant clinical benefit from
the combination of erlotinib and high-dose celecoxib.
This study enrolled a higher percentage of patients with

EGFR mutations than would be expected in the general
population, but both treatment arms were balanced due
to stratification by smoking status. The increased number
of patients with EGFR mutations may have led to a longer
PFS in both treatment arms for the ITT population.
Ninety-six patient serum samples were retrospectively
assessed by VeriStrat (VS) classification (Biodesix, Inc,
Boulder, Colo), which demonstrated longer PFS and OS
in the overall group for those with a good classification
according to VS.30 Analysis of the group considered to
have good classification by VS stratified by EGFR mutation status confirmed an improved PFS in the group
treated with celecoxib among those with EGFR wild-type
tumors.
Furthermore, the use of COX-2 inhibition in patients
with colorectal carcinoma has demonstrated improved outcomes associated with the use of aspirin after diagnosis
related to COX-2 expression in the tumor by IHC.31 The
linkage of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase,
catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations with aspirin
use leading to increased survival in these patients32 reaffirms the molecular basis and need for selection when evaluating COX inhibitor therapy. PIK3CA mutations are less
common in patients with NSCLC, and tissue samples in
the current study were not sufficient for analysis. The heterogeneity of NSCLC is evident and understanding the molecular basis for response and resistance will enhance our
therapies. Overexpression of neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL) also has been shown to lead to
EGFR TKI resistance, and may be modulated by COX-2
inhibition to improve sensitivity.33
The sample size in the current study was too small to
expand our knowledge of PIK3CA mutation status and
outcome, but the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling is altered to promote cell proliferation, growth,
and survival in many NSCLCs,34 and combined EGFR
and COX-2 inhibition may effectively exploit this pathway. The results in the populations with wild-type EGFR
and elevated baseline PGEM are encouraging, and provide supporting evidence to further evaluate these pathways in selected patients. The optimal use of biomarkers
and genomic data may provide additional insights for
improving eicosanoid modulatory agents in combination
therapies for patients with NSCLC.
