Role of Isolated Limb Perfusion With Recombinant
Human Tumor Necrosis Factor a and Melphalan in Locally
Advanced Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Jens Jakob, MD; and Peter Hohenberger, MD, PhD

The management of locally advanced extremity soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs is challenging, particularly for recurrent tumors and
those adjacent to neurovascular bundles and joints. Typically, the tumors are large, below the fascia, and high-grade (T2b or stage III
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer) and thus require multimodal therapy. Treatment options must be tailored to
patient and tumor characteristics. Isolated limb perfusion with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor a and melphalan (TNF-ILP)
adds a therapeutic option to radiation therapy (RT) and systemic chemotherapy. Although the procedure is somewhat sophisticated
to learn, it is a safe method and has been used now for almost 2 decades at more than 50 centers worldwide. TNF-ILP yields a high
rate of complete or nearly complete pathologic tumor remission. In combination with surgical resection of the tumor remnant after
isolated limb perfusion, the limb salvage rate is close to 90%. Often, patients can be spared adjuvant RT without long-term local tumor control rates being compromised. Nevertheless, TNF-ILP has never been compared with another treatment regimen in a randomized trial. This review summarizes the mode of action and standard application of TNF-ILP and focuses on a critical discussion of the
role of TNF-ILP in the multimodal treatment of locally advanced primary and recurrent extremity sarcoma. Cancer 2016;122:2624-32.

INTRODUCTION
Historically, the intra-arterial administration of chemotherapeutic agents was developed in the 1950s to increase the
uptake and, in this way, efficacy of cytotoxic agents. However, only through the isolation of the tumor-bearing organ
from the systemic circulation was it possible to administer doses of cytotoxic agents that would otherwise have had unsupportable systemic toxicity.1 Until the early 1990s, isolated limb and organ perfusion systems also were developed to treat
tumors of various localizations, such as the breast, pelvis, and head and neck.2 Nevertheless, perfusions were performed
mostly for in-transit metastasized melanomas and less frequently for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. The drug of
choice for isolated limb perfusion (ILP) was melphalan (L-phenylalanine mustard), which had acceptable toxicity and
good efficacy at least for melanoma patients.3 Cisplatin and doxorubicin were added as perfusion agents but were later
abandoned because of their unacceptable toxicity when they were combined with hyperthermic tissue conditions hotter
than 398C.4 For sarcoma patients, ILP was of rather limited value. The administration of cytotoxic drugs (even in combination) resulted in significant toxicity but not adequate tumor regression, and recurrence rates after ILP with cytotoxic
drugs with subsequent resection or irradiation were high.5
The introduction of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rhTNFa) by Lienard et al6 revolutionized ILP. The
use of rhTNFa in combination with the priming of the tumor with subcutaneous interferon c and melphalan in the setting
of ILP (ie, isolated limb perfusion with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor a and melphalan [TNF-ILP]) resulted
in 21 complete remissions in 23 patients treated for melanoma or sarcoma, with 9 of the complete remissions confirmed
by histology and the others clinically observed in the melanoma group. In a subsequent multicenter study of 186 patients,
TNF-ILP rendered limb salvage possible in a large number of patients who had been amputation candidates before.7 Consequently, TNF-ILP was approved in Europe to treat patients with limb-threatening extremity soft tissue tumors. To date,
no randomized trial comparing TNF-ILP with other treatment modalities has been performed in sarcoma patients.8

ILP in Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma/Jakob and Hohenberger

Furthermore, rhTNFa has never been approved in the
United States. Thus, the role of TNF-ILP in the multimodal treatment of extremity sarcoma has always been controversial. In this review, we summarize the mechanism of
action of TNF-ILP and report the current standards of
use. The main focus of this article is a critical discussion of
the indication for performing TNF-ILP.
MODE OF ACTION OF TNF-ILP
ILP establishes an external circuit for an arm or leg and
allows control of oxygenation, temperature, and intracircuit hemoglobin. TNF-ILP requires general anesthesia
and whole-body heparinization. Typically and according
to the registered treatment, rhTNFa is combined with
melphalan, an alkylating agent with increased antitumor
activity under hyperthermic conditions. The melphalan
dose of up to 100 mg used in the ILP setting (10-13 mg/L
of perfused extremity) is equivalent to the dosage used for
myeloablation before stem cell transplantation. Tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) is a multifunctional cytokine
mainly secreted by macrophages and plays a major role in
innate and acquired immunity. TNF binds to 2 distinct
receptors and leads to hemodynamic and antitumor
effects in experimental models known since the 1990s.9,10
TNF may be one of the agents in Coley’s toxin, which is
thought to be biologically active.11 Clinical studies in
patients with solid tumors have demonstrated that the
dose-limiting toxicity of systemically administered
rhTNFa is systemic inflammatory response syndrome
with strong hemodynamic effects; at the same time, only
some antitumor efficacy has been seen at tolerable doses
after systemic application.10 The administration of
rhTNFa in the ILP setting enables the avoidance of its
devastating hemodynamic effects, and it has demonstrated strong synergistic antitumor effects with chemotherapeutic agents in melanoma and sarcoma patients.6 In
the ILP setting, rhTNFa has 2 distinct antitumor properties that may be related to each other: increased uptake of
melphalan and selective destruction of tumor neovascularization.12 Furthermore, serial biopsies during TNF-ILP
have demonstrated upregulated multidrug resistance–
associated genes and increased levels of major vault proteins in soft tissue sarcoma and malignant melanoma.13 In
experimental studies, rhTNFa has led to increased vessel
permeability and decreased interstitial pressure as immediate effects after administration.14,15 These early antivascular effects lead to an up to 6-fold–increased uptake of
melphalan into the tumor.16 Late antivascular effects are
best demonstrated in pre– and post–TNF-ILP angiograms or gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging,

which shows a complete shutdown of tumor vasculature;
this is most likely mediated by tumor vessel disintegration
and endothelial apoptosis (Fig. 1).17
Hyperthermia increases the efficacy of cytotoxic
agents such as cisplatin and alkylating agents such as melphalan at temperatures higher than 408C.18 This so-called
thermal chemosensitization is most likely based on
increased drug uptake and chemical activity. In the ILP
setting, however, real hyperthermia with temperatures
higher than 40.58C leads to unacceptable toxicity, including severe tissue necrosis, which often requires amputation.19,20 Furthermore, data from clinical studies could
not demonstrate a correlation between ILP-induced tumor hyperthermia and treatment response.21 Therefore,
mild hyperthermia with a maximal tumor temperature of
39.58C is generated in the limb circuit before the administration of rhTNFa and melphalan. Clinically, this already
means a temperature rise of 5 to 68C in the limb.
CURRENT STANDARDS IN TNF-ILP
The surgical details of the TNF-ILP technique have been
repeatedly reported before (Fig. 2).2 It is predominantly a
procedure for high-grade sarcomas of any subtype and not
for large but low-grade tumors. In brief, the surgeon
exposes and cannulates the major vessels of the tumorbearing limb and separates the limb from the systemic circuit by a tourniquet, and the limb circuit is maintained by
a heart-lung machine. The limb is then heated to a tissue
temperature of 38 to 39.58C, and rhTNFa and melphalan
are administered sequentially. After the perfusion, the extremity is rinsed with sterile solutions, and the normal circulation is restored.
Just as any therapeutic intervention, ILP has evolved
over time:
 The limb circuit is heated until a tumor temperature of
38 to 39.58C is reached because higher temperatures
lead to unacceptable local toxicity.19,20 Notably, the tumor and muscle temperature should be measured
because often soft tissue sarcomas do exhibit higher
temperatures than normal tissue; this relation is
reversed during the heating process.21 Both aspects may
be explained by the dysfunctional tumor vasculature,
which is one of the targets of rhTNFa.
 In the multi-institutional studies that led to the approval of rhTNFa (Beromun; Boehringer-Ingelheim,
Germany), 3 mg of rhTNFa was administered for arm
perfusions, whereas 4 mg was used for leg perfusions.7
No dose-finding study anteceded the first report; the
dose selection of rhTNFa was empirical.6 A subsequent

randomized trial demonstrated that lower dosages of
rhTNFa were not inferior to high-dose rhTNFa with
respect to tumor responses.22 Currently, most ILP centers do not use rhTNFa dosages greater than 2 mg for
the lower extremities or greater than 1 mg for the upper
extremities.
 In the initial trials, melphalan was injected into the
limb circuit 30 minutes after rhTNFa, and the cumulative perfusion time was 90 minutes.6,7 Hoven-Gondri
et al23 demonstrated that the perfusion time may be
reduced to 60 minutes without the treatment response
being compromised. The standard perfusion time is
currently 60 to 75 minutes, and melphalan is administered 15 minutes after rhTNFa.
 The vascular access for establishing the limb circuit is
chosen to be as close to the tumor as possible. Nevertheless, direct perfusion of the tumor-feeding vessels has to
be ensured. They may be depicted on gadoliniumbased magnetic resonance imaging or conventional
angiograms. More distantly located vascular cannulation (eg, femoral vs iliac) allows easier and more reliable
2626

separation of the limb circuit from the systemic circulation and is advantageous for reducing rhTNFa leakage
to the system via the obturator foramen. If the tumor
location is at the knee or the proximal part of the lower
leg (or the elbow or the proximal part of the forearm),
the extremity distant to the tumor may be excluded
from the perfusion by an Esmarch bandage (segmental
perfusion) to prevent toxicity to the smaller and more
vulnerable muscles of the foot or hand (Fig. 2). When
the tumor is located in the proximal thigh or upper
arm, cannulation of iliac or subclavian vessels is necessary, the extremity is isolated from systemic circulation
by a silicon tourniquet (instead of a pneumatic tourniquet), and the entire distal limb is protected from the
perfusion by an Esmarch bandage.
 It is well known that the muscle temperature, rhTNFa
and melphalan dose, perfusion time, and systemic leakage are critical factors for local and systemic TNF-ILP
toxicity. The limitation of the maximum temperature
and the reduction of the rhTNFa dose, perfusion time,
and perfused limb volume result in less systemic and

local toxicity. In effect, the proportion of toxic grade III
or IV reactions according to Wieberdink after ILPs
with rhTNFa and melphalan is roughly equal to the
toxicity of isolated limb infusion (ILI) with melphalan
alone22,24-26 (Table 1).
 TNF-ILP is a neoadjuvant procedure. The understanding of destroying the sarcoma by destroying its vasculature is the key element of success. The margins of
resection typically improve from so-called almost unresectable with clear margins or with margins > 1 mm to
resectable with 1-2 mm of a margin to a necrotic tumor
remnant. This is not a totally scientific description but
is taken from clinical experience with almost 400 ILPs
performed for sarcomas (Fig. 3). A more refined analysis has shown that after TNF-ILP, there is a 1-mm fiCancer

brous capsule along with a median 1.8-mm reactive
zone (Fig. 1); this is the largest induced by any neoadjuvant treatment in sarcomas.28 Grabellus et al28 demonstrated that surgical margins are improved because of
the elimination of viable tumor cells in the fibrous
pseudocapsule.
 Tumor resection should be performed as wide or compartmental resection as otherwise usually performed for
extremity soft tissue sarcoma. TNF-ILP leads to distinct
response patterns with devitalization of tumor margins;
close or positive margins at critical structures thus may
be acceptable. Nevertheless, marginal resections of tumor remnants for minimal functional impairment after
TNF-ILP are associated with high local recurrence
rates.29 If no resection of the residual tumor is performed, perhaps for intercurrent lung metastases
requiring treatment, our experience shows that the extremity tumor will be kept under control by TNF-ILP
alone often for almost 1 year.
 Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is a standard treatment for locally advanced extremity soft tissue sarcoma.
The combination of preoperative TNF-ILP and postoperative RT is associated with increased local longterm toxicity, including joint stiffness and bone fracture.30 Moreover, a multivariate analysis of TNF-ILP
cohorts did not show an advantage in local disease–free
survival (LDFS) for patients treated with adjuvant RT
after TNF-ILP and tumor resection.31 For patients
with clear resection margins and a complete response to
TNF-ILP, adjuvant RT may be omitted to avoid
toxicity.
TREATMENT EFFICACY OF TNF-ILP
TNF-ILP was introduced into the therapy of soft tissue
sarcomas to avoid amputation in the setting of limbthreatening extremity tumors. Consequently, the most
2627

Review Article

frequently reported endpoints of TNF-ILP cohort studies
are limb salvage and pathologic response rates. In the European multicenter trial, tumor resection and limb salvage
were achieved for 82%.7 A number of subsequent cohort
studies reported limb salvage rates of 76% to 96% (Table
2). The most important criticism of these trials is that
TNF-ILP was used to treat not only amputation candidates but also patients who required resection with major
functional morbidities, including fixation to or invasion
into neurovascular bundles and/or bone. Without a
doubt, almost all ILP centers are experts in sarcoma treatment. Nevertheless, the endpoint of limb salvage remains
controversial with respect to these definitions of
“mutilating surgery” and “resection with major functional
morbidity.”
In contrast to osteosarcoma, the evaluation of the
pathologic response after the neoadjuvant treatment of
soft tissue sarcomas by irradiation, chemotherapy, or
TNF-ILP has not yet been standardized with respect to
the selection and evaluation of tumor areas to achieve
comparable results between different laboratories.34 However, there are detailed reports of the extent of regression
presenting mainly as necrosis or fibrosis/sclerosis upon
histopathology according to the histological subtype and
preoperative treatment.33,35 In addition to the lack of
standardization, many of the large, high-grade sarcomas
already exhibit significant necrotic areas before treatment.
Regardless of these limitations, the extent of necrosis in a
resected specimen may be used to estimate the efficacy of
preoperative treatment. This is especially true for limbthreatening tumors when only marginal or intralesional
resection may be possible. Complete pathologic remission
after TNF-ILP has been described in up to 47%, and an
overall response rate (more than 50% tumor necrosis in
the resected specimen) has been reported in up to 91%
(Table 2). These response rates are better than those of
any other neoadjuvant treatment modality. Furthermore,
Grabellus et al28,33 demonstrated that TNF-ILP results in
a distinct response pattern with improved surgical margins because of the elimination of viable tumor cells in the
fibrous pseudocapsule of the tumors. In conclusion, the
main feature of TNF-ILP is the achievement of an excellent treatment response.
ONCOLOGICAL OUTCOME AFTER TNF-ILP
AND TUMOR RESECTION
In concordance with the primary goal of TNF-ILP, which
is limb salvage, only 3 studies have documented the oncological outcomes of patients with primary extremity
sarcoma treated with TNF-ILP and tumor

resection.23,31,36 The largest cohort was described by
the Rotterdam group (n 5 134), which reported an
estimated 5-year LDFS of 73% after TNF-ILP and tumor resection.36 Remarkably, tumor surgery was performed as a shelling-out procedure with R2 resections
in a relevant number of patients. The results at Groningen for 71 patients were much better, with an estimated 5-year LDFS of 87% achieved by compartmentoriented resection of the residual tumor.23 With a similar surgical approach, the estimated 5-year LDFS was
82% for 90 patients treated at the sarcoma centers of
Berlin and Mannheim with TNF-ILP as a neoadjuvant
treatment followed by radical limb-preserving resection,
and the estimated 5-year metastasis-free survival rate
was 51%, which demonstrated the aggressive behavior
of the sarcomas selected for ILP treatment.31 TNF-ILP
has never been compared with other treatment options
in a randomized trial and probably never will be. These
options may be RT, chemotherapy, or both eventually
combined with regional hyperthermia (Table 3). The
reasons are the low incidence of limb-threatening sarcomas, the presence of other tailored treatment strategies,
and the low availability of TNF-ILP.8

This table displays only a small selection of studies and is not the result of a systematic review.

The current, scientifically established standard therapy for locally advanced extremity sarcoma is resection
and RT. The 5-year LDFS rates reported for the combination of tumor resection and brachytherapy or externalbeam radiation were 89% to 92%.37,38 It should be kept
in mind that TNF-ILP is typically used to handle large,
high-grade tumors located deep in the fascia. The aforementioned RT trials included a relevant number of
patients with either superficial or superficial and deep
tumors37 or allowed additional chemotherapy for highgrade tumors,38 and their results are not directly comparable to those of TNF-ILP cohorts. Furthermore, preoperative RT results in increased wound-healing problems,
whereas postoperative irradiation produces less favorable
Cancer

functional outcomes because of the higher radiation dose
and the larger radiation field.42 In this view, TNF-ILP
may be a rather charming tool for avoiding RT in approximately 50% of patients without compromising local tumor control.
Because patients with high-grade tumors develop
metastatic disease at rates of approximately 30% to 50%,
there could be a rationale for adjuvant chemotherapy,
which also may have an impact on LDFS, as suggested by
older studies and a meta-analysis.43 However, the most
recent and largest trial evaluating the efficacy of adjuvant
chemotherapy could not prove better local recurrence
rates or overall survival.44 Gronchi et al40 reported an
excellent estimated 5-year LDFS rate of 94% for patients
2629

Review Article

with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma treated with 3 cycles
of preoperative chemotherapy together with preoperative
or postoperative RT at the discretion of the treating physician with no further impact of 2 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy in a randomized trial. Issels et al41 reported a 4year LDFS rate of 92% for patients treated with a combination of deep-wave hyperthermia, systemic chemotherapy, surgery, and external-beam radiation in a trial
randomizing patients to hyperthermia or no hyperthermia. Any direct comparison of the reported TNF-ILP
cohorts with the other multimodal treatment approaches
is biased by the fact that treatment selection by interdisciplinary teams depends on the technical equipment available and thus results in believer and nonbelievers.
INDICATION FOR TNF-ILP
rhTNFa was approved in the ILP setting for limbthreatening tumors by the European Medicines Agency
for soft tissue tumors, and beyond sarcoma and melanoma, there are excellent treatment results for desmoid
tumors, lymphoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma.45-47 One
could argue that “ILP should (only) be considered as
potential therapy when other options are not available.”48
However, because of the high efficacy and low toxicity of
currently used ILP treatment schedules, we and many
others believe that TNF-ILP should be used not only if
everything else fails; instead, we think that a more tailored
approach should be applied.
Because of the high pathologic response rates and
improved surgical margins after TNF-ILP, the indication
for performing TNF-ILP should be evaluated even for
primary tumors if infiltration, encasement, and fixation of
motor nerves, major vessels, or bones are present. This is
especially true for patients who present with local recurrences or are expected to suffer from relevant (acute or
long-term) toxicity from preoperative chemotherapy or
irradiation. In the case of locally recurrent extremity sarcoma, TNF-ILP is an effective option mainly for those
who have undergone RT before, but the treatment results
are clearly worse than those for primary tumors. Finally,
TNF-ILP may be indicated also for patients with concurrent metastatic disease. If the palliation of local symptoms
and limb salvage are the primary treatment goals, TNFILP may be performed as an upfront treatment before systemic chemotherapy or even between systemic chemotherapy cycles. Often, systemic chemotherapy affects lung
metastases much better than the primary tumor or a local
recurrence.
ILI and ILP with the administration of melphalan
alone may be considered equally effective in melanoma
2630

patients. In technical terms, the main differences between
ILI and ILP are the vascular access (surgical in ILP vs
interventional in ILI), the mode of limb circulation maintenance (roller pump in ILP vs manual in ILI), and the oxygenation of the limb during the procedure (normoxic or
hyperoxic in ILP vs hypoxic in ILI). In clinical terms, the
main difference is the administration of rhTNFa during
ILP, which is not possible in the ILI setting. Clinical
results for sarcoma patients treated by ILI with melphalan
alone are, not surprisingly, comparable to those achieved
with ILP before the rhTNFa era.49 Therefore, we would
rather recommend systemic chemotherapy than ILI with
melphalan if TNF-ILP appears to be the best treatment
choice but is not available.
Difficulties in assessing the value of TNF-ILP for extremity sarcoma include the lack of randomized trials and
the limited availability of TNF-ILP at sarcoma centers
and, consequently, the division of believers and nonbelievers within the sarcoma community. The same might
be true for (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy for high-grade,
nonmetastatic extremity sarcoma, and discussions may be
conducted with similar arguments. The difference, however, is that ILP centers are eligible and are probably willing to recruit patients for an adjuvant chemotherapy trial,
whereas non-ILP centers are less likely to recruit or refer
patients for an ILP study. Further clinical and translational studies of TNF-ILP should focus on the evaluation
of surrogate markers for the treatment response because
there might be markers of improved response for certain
sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, technical innovations such
as interventional vascular access for TNF-ILP or new drug
combinations may be tested in the future to further reduce
ILP toxicity or increase treatment efficacy. One promising
option may be the administration of vial or gene therapy
during ILP to prevent the first-pass effect and exploit the
exclusive and continuous delivery of treatment to the
tumor-bearing limb.50
