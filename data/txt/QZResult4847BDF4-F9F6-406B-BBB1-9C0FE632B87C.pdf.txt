BACKGROUND. The purpose was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan and cisplatin with concurrent split-course thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in
locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer.

METHODS. Fifty patients fulfilling the following eligibility criteria were enrolled:
chemotherapy-naive, good performance status (PS, 0-2), age <75, stage III, and
adequate organ function. The patients received irinotecan 60 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 in
the first group. The doses were reduced to 50 and 60 mg/m2, respectively, in the
second group. Two cycles of chemotherapy were repeated every 4 weeks. Splitcourse thoracic radiotherapy of 2 Gy/day commenced on Day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle, with 28 and 32 Gy administered in the first and second cycles,

RESULTS. Fifty patients were eligible and 48 (16 in the first, 32 in the second
group) patients were assessable for response, toxicity, and survival. The overall
neutropenia, grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, pneumonitis, esophagitis, and fatigue
occurred in 21%, 48%, 19%, 10%, and 19%, respectively. The median time to progression was 8.2 months. The median overall survival time and the 2- and 5-year
survival rates were 20.1 months, 47.1%, and 17.1%, respectively. In subgroup
analysis, grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the overall response, and the
median survival times of the first/second groups were 63%/41%, 19%/19%, 75%/
88%, and 13.1/33.4 months, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. This combined modality of irinotecan and cisplatin with concurrent TRT is active and further investigations are warranted at the second group
dose level. Cancer 2007;110:606–13.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It is
also the Japanese leading cause of death, with 57,000 deaths
(18.3% of all cancer deaths) in 2003.1 Of all lung cancer cases,
approximately 80% are nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),2 and
25% to 40% of NSCLC patients have stage III, locally advanced disease.3 Thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes has been the traditional treatment for patients
with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC.4 As the therapy
provided 5-year survival rates of only 5% to 7%, with a median survival time of 6 to 11 months,5 a combined modality of chemother-

apy and radiotherapy was attempted. Three metaanalyses of randomized trials demonstrated that
combination chemoradiotherapy was superior to
radiotherapy alone.6–8 Phase 3 trials have suggested
that the concurrent administration of these 2 modalities improves long-term survival compared with sequential strategies.9–11
Irinotecan is a semisynthetic, water-soluble prodrug that is metabolized to the active metabolite SN38, which inhibits the function of DNA topoisomerase I in cancer cells.12,13 Clinical studies of irinotecan
alone have shown a broad spectrum of antitumor
activity against various human cancers including
NSCLC,14 and preclinical studies demonstrated
synergism and noncross-resistance between the
combination of cisplatin with SN-38 and irinotecan.15,16 Phase 2 and 3 trials of irinotecan/cisplatin
therapy in Japan yielded a 44% to 52% response rate
and 10.1 to 11.5 months of median survival for
NSCLC,17,18 and a preclinical study showed an
enhancement effect with the use of irinotecan on tumor radiosensitivity.19 A previous Japanese trial of
irinotecan/cisplatin with concurrent standard radiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions failed because of
unacceptable toxicity.20 In our phase 1 trial,21 we
incorporated split-course radiotherapy with a rest period between 2 chemotherapy cycles and demonstrated tolerability and a good response rate of 69.6%
(95% confidence interval [CI], 47.1%–86.8%).
Based on these results, we conducted a phase 2
trial of irinotecan/cisplatin with concurrent splitcourse radiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC. The
main objective of the trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of this regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by
the ethics committee of each institution and written
informed consent was obtained from all study participants. This study is an independent collaborative
(not-sponsored) group study. The participating institutions and investigators were: Second Department

Patients and Evaluation
Patients with previously untreated, unresectable, and
locally advanced stage III NSCLC were enrolled, but
patients with malignant pleural effusion were
excluded. Eligibility criteria included the following: a
histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC; age
<75 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS) 2; adequate bone
marrow function (leukocyte count 4000/lL, platelet
count 10 3 104/lL, and hemoglobin level 10.0 g/
dL); serum bilirubin level 1.5 mg/dL; alanine and
aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST) levels 2
times the upper limit of normal; serum creatinine
level 1.5 mg/dL, and PaO2 70 torr; and no medical
problems severe enough to prevent compliance with
the protocol.
Treatment
Treatment commenced within 1 week of enrollment
and 2 cycles of irinotecan/cisplatin therapy were
repeated at 4-week intervals. Based on our phase 1
study,21 patients received 60 mg/m2 of irinotecan on
Days 1, 8, and 15, and 80 mg/m2 of cisplatin on Day
1. After 16 patients were enrolled the chemotherapy
dose was reduced to irinotecan 50 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2. Irinotecan was not administered on
Day 8 or 15 in the cycle if the leukocyte count was
<3000/lL, the platelet count was <10 3 104/lL, or
the patient had diarrhea on those days. The next
cycle commenced after the leukocyte and platelet
counts reached at least 3000/lL and 10 3 104/lL,
respectively. After completion of combined modality
treatment, additional irinotecan/cisplatin therapy
was optionally permitted.
Thoracic radiation was administered once daily
with a split-schedule: 5 days/week with 2 Gy/day
from Day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle, with a total
of 28 and 32 Gy provided in the first and second
cycles, respectively. There was a break in the splitcourse radiation of approximately 10 days. Based on
a recent chest computed tomography (CT) scan, the
radiation volumes and fields were individualized for
each patient. The radiation fields encompassed the
areas of all visible tumor and involved lymph nodes

(1.0 cm) with a margin of 1.5 to 2 cm for each, as
well as ipsilateral hilar, superior mediastinal, and
subcarinal nodes. The area of the lung field included
in the radiation field was not greater than half of the
area of the ipsilateral lung. All radiation was delivered with megavoltage linear accelerators. Isodose
curves and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were
calculated for the lungs and the esophagus. Patients
received the intended radiotherapy with a total dose
of 60 Gy. The maximum dose to any level of the spinal cord did not exceed 45 Gy. Local control was
defined as no evidence of progressive disease within
the planned radiation field. The treatment schema is
shown in Figure 1.

Dose Modification
Irinotecan treatment was omitted on Days 8 and 15
if the leukocyte count fell below 3000/lL, platelet
count <10 3 104/lL, or any diarrhea occurred. Leukocytes 3000/lL and platelets 10 3 104/lL were
mandatory to commence the second cycle of treatment, and if levels fell below these limits the second
cycle was postponed until the counts recovered.
Doses of irinotecan and cisplatin were reduced to
80% when dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 neutropenia
lasting 4 days or more, grade 4 thrombocytopenia,
and grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicities
except nausea and vomiting) occurred during the
first treatment cycle.
Radiation was interrupted if grade 4 hematologic
toxicity occurred during radiation, and restarted after
recovery to grade 3 or less. If grade 3 or greater
esophagitis occurred, it was interrupted and restarted
after recovery to grade 2 or less. If esophagitis did
not resolve it was discontinued. If PaO2 fell to 10 torr
or a patient had a fever of 38 8C or higher, both
radiotherapy and chemotherapy were interrupted
and restarted as soon as possible after recovery.
Toxicity and Response Evaluation
Eligibility, assessability, and tumor responses were
determined by external reviewers. Drug toxicity was

graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria, v. 2.22 Before the first
cycle a blood cell count, urinalysis, and biochemistry
tests were performed to assess renal and hepatic
function and electrolytes. This monitoring was repeated during treatment, whereas other investigations were repeated, as necessary, to evaluate marker
lesions. After the completion of treatment each disease was assessed and tumors restaged. Tumor
response was classified according to the World
Health Organization (WHO) criteria23: complete
response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), and progressive disease (PD).

Statistical Analyses
The primary endpoint of this study was to estimate
the objective response rate. The 2-stage accrual
design described by Simon24 was used. Assuming an
overall response rate of 50% for standard therapy,
a target response rate of 70% was established.
Alpha 5 0.05, beta 5 0.20, and the estimated required number of patients was more than 37. Considering unfitness, dropout, and discontinuation, the
sample size of this study was determined to be 45.
Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier
method.25 Subset-analysis was performed by MannWhitney U, log-rank, and Breslow-Gehan-Wilcoxon
analysis. The statistical test was 2-sided and a probability value <0.05 was defined as statistically significant.

RESULTS
Fifty patients from 12 institutions were enrolled in
this trial between September 1998 and August 2003.
One patient was ineligible because of malignant effusion after enrollment. Another patient withdrew
informed consent and transferred to a different hospital. Forty-eight patients received the planned treatment and were evaluated for toxicity, response, and
survival. The baseline patient characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Patients in PS 2 were eligible but
were not enrolled in the study.

Treatment Administration
A total of 133 cycles of irinotecan plus cisplatin were
administered to the 48 patients: 1 cycle in 4 patients,
2 cycles in 19, 3 in 11, 4 in 12, and 5 in 2. Then the
latter 25 (52%) patients followed the same consolidative regimen chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy.
Thirty (23%) irinotecan administrations were skipped
on Day 8, 67 (50%) on Day 15, including 19 (14%) on
both days. The major reasons for omission on Days 8
and 15 were leukopenia 60 cases, diarrhea 8 cases,

patient refusal 4 cases, nausea and infection 3 cases
each, reduction in PS, liver dysfunction, and leukopenia/thrombocytopenia 2 cases, pneumonitis, fever,
ileus, leukopenia/diarrhea, leukopenia/liver dysfunction 1 case. The administration rate of irinotecan on
Days 8 and 15 was 77% and 50%, respectively. The
average treatment delay of the second cycle was 1.6
days per case. The dose intensity of irinotecan in the
first 2 cycles was 27.5 (60/80 level, 27.9; 50/60 level,
27.4) mg/m2/week, which was 69.0% (60/80 level,
62.0%; 50/60 level, 73.1%) of the projected dose intensity. The dose intensity rate relative to the projected dose intensity of cisplatin was 96.4% (60/80
level, 96.7%; 50/60 level, 96.1%).
Of the first 16 patients, 5 (31%) could not complete the planned chemoradiotherapy because of refusal (3), prolonged neutropenia (1), and PD (1). The
patients who refused experienced grade 3 fatigue,
esophagitis, hiccoughs, or grade 4 neutropenia. This
problem was discussed by the investigators and irinotecan and cisplatin doses were reduced to 50 and
60 mg/m2, respectively, which were nearly 80% of
the initial dose, and 3 of 4 patients experienced a
partial response at the same dose level in our phase
1 trial.21 After drug-dose reduction, compliance with
the treatment including TRT became favorable and
almost all patients completed the treatment, except
for 2 patients who experienced pneumonitis and prolonged infection.

Toxicity
The toxicities during the treatment are listed in Table
2. All 48 patients were assessable for toxicity. Fortyone (85%) patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, and 23 (48%) had grade 4. The principal grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was leukopenia
and neutropenia in 39 (81%) patients, and the principal grade 4 toxicity was neutropenia in 23 (48%)
patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 (6%)
patients. The major nonhematologic toxicities were
infection, gastrointestinal toxicity, and fatigue. One
patient had grade 4 bloody diarrhea with ileus and
multiple digestive ulcers during the second cycle and
underwent a blood transfusion. Grade 3 radiation
pneumonitis occurred in 5 (10%) patients. Grade 3
skin toxicity, mucositis, and alopecia were each
observed in 1 (2%) patient. There was no treatmentrelated death.
Efficacy
All 48 patients were assessed for response. Objective
tumor response was observed in 40 patients, with an
overall response rate of 83% (95% CI, 70%–93%).
Stable disease was observed in 7 (15%) patients, and
the remaining 1 (2%) patient had progressive disease.
Responses at each stage were 100% (11 PR) in IIIA
and 78% (29 PR, 7 SD, and 1 PD) in IIIB.
The median potential follow-up time was 61.7
(range, 29.8–89.0) months. Twelve patients survived
and the other 36 patients died during the follow-up
period. The progression-free survival of 48 patients is

shown in Figure 2A. Median time to tumor progression was 8.2 (95% CI, 6.0–10.3) months, and the 1-,
2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates
were 40.4%, 22.7%, 17.3%, 17.3%, and 17.3%, respectively. The overall survival of 48 patients is shown in
Figure 2B. Median survival time was 21.0 (95% CI:
16.8–25.2) months, and the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year
survival rates were 73.9%, 47.1%, 31.4%, 25.7%, and
17.1%, respectively.

Subset Analysis of Difference Between 2 Chemotherapy
Dose Levels
Overall survival before and after drug reduction is
shown in Figure 3A. The curves separated at about 9
months, and suggested a significant difference in
favor of postdrug dose reduction (irinotecan 50 mg/
m2 1 cisplatin 60 mg/m2 1 TRT) in both log-rank
(P 5 .011) and Breslow-Gehan-Wilcoxon (P 5 .009)
analyses. The median survival time, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and
5-year survival rates before and after dose reduction
were 13.1 (95% CI, 4.5–21.7) months, 55.0%, 27.5%,

months, 83.7%, 56.9%, 45.0%, 31.5%, 15.7%, respectively. The differences between the 2 chemotherapy
dose levels are shown in Table 3. No differences were
observed in baseline characteristics. After dose reduction, the dose intensity (DI) of cisplatin was
reduced by almost 5 mg/m2/week (P < .001), whereas
irinotecan was not reduced because of higher execution rates on Day 8 (which was not significant) and
Day 15 (P 5 .032). Seven patients could not complete
the planned treatment as stated in the treatment
administration paragraph, so the differences of completion rates were significant (P 5 .022) between the
2 dose levels. The overall survival curves by irinotecan execution times on Days 8 and 15 are shown in
Figure 3B,C, respectively. Both curves favored high
execution rates and the differences were analyzed by
2 methods. The difference of curves on Day 15 was
significant in both log-rank (P 5 .026) and BreslowGehan-Wilcoxon (P 5 .031) tests. The difference of
curves on Day 8 was significant in the log-rank
tests (P 5 .014) but was not significant in BreslowGehan-Wilcoxon (P 5 .074).

Treatment Failure Pattern
Of the 45 evaluable patients in this investigation, 31
(69%) recurred. The first sites of disease progression
were as follows: local only in 13 (42%) patients, local

6 (19%) patients, the initial site of recurrence was the
brain. Of these, 3 recurred solely in the brain. Other recurrence sites included pleural effusion, bone, and
lung (outside the TRT field) in 4 patients, and the liver,
supraclavicular lymph node, ascites, and pericardial
effusion in 1 patient. Treatment failure within 6 months
is presented in Table 4. The significant failure factors
were young age (64), female, not completing the
treatment, dose 60/80, and irinotecan low execution on
Day 15. These factors also impacted overall survival
except for young age (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Irinotecan/cisplatin therapy yielded 31.0% to 43.7%
overall response and 46.5% to 59.2% 1-year survival
in Japanese randomized phase 3 trials,18,26 and
28.8% overall response and 37% 1-year survival in a
phase 2 trial in the US27 for stage IIIB, IV NSCLC.
Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated the
radiosensitizing activity of irinotecan.19,28 Therefore,
irinotecan/cisplatin plus TRT is considered 1 of the
most active strategies for locally advanced NSCLC.
Although the Fox Chase Cancer Center Group
reported the tolerability of irinotecan/cisplatin with
standard thoracic radiotherapy,29 a previous Japanese
dose-finding trial of irinotecan/cisplatin with concurrent 60 Gy radiotherapy was not completed because
of unacceptable toxicity.20 We incorporated split-

Gy thoracic radiotherapy in the phase 1 trial.21 In
the present phase 2 trial, however, we were confronted with severe toxicity of grade 3/4 neutropenia
(88%), a low irinotecan execution rate on Day 15
(22%), a low completion rate (69%), and patients’ refusal to continue the treatment in the first 60/80
dose level, and decided to reduce the dose of irinotecan/cisplatin to 50/60 mg/m2. After dose reduction
the trial went smoothly and the dose of 50/60 mg/
m2 was considered the recommended dose for this
combined modality. The results of the present study,
including a response rate of 83%, median survival
time of 21.0 months, and 2-year survival time of
47.1%, are encouraging.
One problem of phase 2 trials is that most trials
evaluate only the maximum tolerated dose defined
by the phase 1 trial. The present trial could not continue at the maximum dose; however, dose reduction
fortunately achieved good results. The completion
rates of therapy significantly increased from 69% to
94%. Although a cautious estimation might be
needed in subset analysis, the median survival time
of 33.4 months at the 50/60 dose level of the present
trial was promising. In contrast, the median survival
time of the 60/80 level, at which we could not continue the trial, was only 13.1 months. The first possible reason for these differences between the 2 dose
levels is that full-dose chemotherapy with concurrent
radiotherapy may be too toxic for normal tissue
when using third-generation new cytotoxic agents.
We incorporated split-course radiotherapy to cope
with this problem, but it was not sufficient. The second possible reason is that chemotherapy between
chemotherapy cycles, as on Day 15, may play an important role in chemoradiotherapy, although there is
a negative trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy
using a daily radiosensitizer.30 The irinotecan execution rate on Day 15 at the 50/60 level (48%) was significantly higher than that at the 60/80 level (22%)
and, as a result, the dose intensities of irinotecan at
both levels were very similar (27.9% in 60/80 vs
27.4% in 50/60). In an examination of early (within 6
months) treatment failure, higher irinotecan execution on Day 15 was associated with higher local and
distant control (Table 4) and longer survival (Fig.
3C). On Day 8 of irinotecan treatment, there were no
differences in treatment failure, but it might have
affected survival after 1.4 years (Fig. 3B). The recommended doses of 40/60 mg/m2 of irinotecan/cisplatin chemoradiotherapy for small-cell lung cancer

(SCLC)31,32 and 50/60 mg/m2 defined in the present
study for NSCLC are very similar.
The main toxicity of our irinotecan/cisplatin
with radiotherapy was hematologic. Comparing grade
3 or higher toxicities in the present trial with those
for early concurrent radiotherapy arms of trials by
Furuse et al.,9 Fournel et al.,11 and Belani et al.,33 diarrhea (19%) was higher in our trial, thrombocytopenia was higher in the trial by Furuse et al. (53% vs
6%–16%), and nausea/vomiting (7% vs 19%–24%)
and neutropenia (26% vs 77%–99%) were lower in
the trial by Belani et al. These differences varied
based on the nature of the chemotherapy regimen
used (irinotecan/cisplatin vs mitomicin/vindesine/
cisplatin vs cisplatin/etoposide vs paclitaxel/carboplatin). Interestingly, esophagitis was lower in the
former 2 trials compared with the latter (3%–10% vs
28%–32%). Considered with the median survival of
these trials (20.1, 16.5, 16.3, 16.3 months, respectively), it seems that split-course concurrent radiotherapy could reduce the risk of esophagitis without
loss of activity compared with continuous use.
Gandara et al.34 reported a phase 2 trial of consolidation docetaxel after concurrent chemoradiotherapy
with cisplatin plus etoposide for stage IIIB NSCLC,
and achieved a median survival time of 26 months.
The report recognized the possible important role of
consolidation chemotherapy, and the treatment
became 1 of the key regimens in this field. Although
our therapy did not plan consolidation like docetaxel,
optional irinotecan plus cisplatin continuation after
chemoradiotherapy, which was used in 25 patients
(52%), might have a favorable influence. Recently,
Jeremic et al.35 reported a phase 2 trial of chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC. They used twice daily
hyperfractionated radiotherapy to a total dose of 67.6
Gy concurrently with daily 25 mg/m2 carboplatin
and 10 mg/m2 paclitaxel after 30 mg/m2 paclitaxel
on Day 1, and achieved the best median survival
time of 28 months; however, their treatment is complicated for practical treatment. Our therapy at the
50/60 level also encouraged survival potential and
was suitable for practical use.
In conclusion, our multicenter phase 2 trial
demonstrated the encouraging activity of irinotecan
and cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy for
patients with stage III NSCLC. Further investigations
are warranted at the 50 mg/m2 irinotecan and
60 mg/m2 cisplatin dose level.
