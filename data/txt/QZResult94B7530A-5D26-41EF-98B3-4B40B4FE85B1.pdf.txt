BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of atrasentan (Xinlay), a selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist, in patients
with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).

METHODS. This multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 809
men with metastatic HRPC. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either atrasentan 10 mg per day or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to disease progression (TTP), which was determined according to radiographic and clinical
measures. Analyses of overall survival and changes in biomarkers also were performed.

RESULTS. Atrasentan did not reduce the risk of disease progression relative to
placebo (hazards ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–1.04; P 5 .136). Most
patients progressed radiographically at the first 12-week bone scan without concomitant clinical progression. In exploratory analyses, increases from baseline to
final bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels
were significantly lower with atrasentan treatment (P < .05 for each). The median

dvanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(HRPC), which is characterized by the development of painful osteoblastic metastases, remains an
incurable disease. Despite recent improvements in
survival reported with docetaxel-based chemotherapy,1,2 independent data collected from OncoTrack, a
comprehensive patient records database that tracks
drug use and patient characteristics, indicates that
only approximately 50% of patients with metastatic
HRPC ever receive chemotherapy.3 Effective, well-tolerated agents that delay disease progression, particularly the onset of the often severe and debilitating
consequences of bone metastases associated with
HRPC, still are needed.
Atrasentan (Xinlay) is a highly potent, selective
endothelin-A (ETA) receptor antagonist that blocks or
reverses the biologic effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1).4
ET-1 is a weak mitogen for prostate cancer cell
lines but a significant inhibitor of chemotherapyinduced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.5 It is highly
secreted by normal prostate epithelial cells and is expressed in all stages of prostate cancer, both within
the gland and in all metastatic lesions tested.6 Moreover, the predominant receptor subtype shifts from ETB
in normal prostate tissue to ETA in prostate tumors.7
Mounting evidence indicates that ET-1 is involved in the osteoblastic bone remodeling response
typical of the disease.8,9 Osteoblasts express ETA
receptors at high density (from 105 to 106 receptors
per cell), and tumor-derived ET-1 drives osteoblast
proliferation and new bone formation through this
receptor.10–13 Proliferating osteoblasts generate other
growth factors that appear to stimulate local metastatic tumor production reciprocally, creating a
positive feedback loop.14–16 Preclinical studies demonstrate that the effects of ET-1 on prostate cancer
cells and osteoblasts can be blocked by selective
endothelin receptor antagonists.5–14,17 Therefore, the
ETA receptor and the endothelin axis are attractive
targets for the management of HRPC.
Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated
that atrasentan can be administered on a once-daily
oral dosing schedule.18,19 In a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2 trial,
atrasentan at a dose of 10 mg per day demonstrated
a significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and other markers
of bone remodeling in men with metastatic HRPC. In
an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, a nonsignificant
trend in delaying clinical disease progression was
noted in favor of atrasentan.20,21 In the current
report, we present findings from a larger randomized
Phase 3 trial of atrasentan 10 mg per day that was

conducted in a similar group of men with metastatic
HRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
This Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study was conducted at 180 sites in 21
countries. Patients were recruited between June 25,
2001 and November 25, 2002 and were eligible to
participate if they had metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma that was refractory to androgen-ablation
therapy, as defined by standard criteria (rising PSA or
PSA >20 ng/mL).22 A centralized, independent radiologic reviewer confirmed the presence of distant
metastases at baseline by computed tomography
(CT) scans, magnetic resonance images (MRI), and/
or bone scans. Surgical or pharmacologic castration
3 months before randomization and a screening
testosterone level <50 ng/dL were required. Patients
with pharmacologic castration were to continue
androgen-suppression therapy during the study.
Patients had to be free of disease-related pain that
required opioids, and they had to have a Karnofsky
performance score between 70 and 100 with a life expectancy >6 months. Patients were ineligible if they
had ever received radionuclides or chemotherapy, if
they had inadequate withdrawal from antiandrogen
therapy (4 weeks for flutamide and 6 weeks for
nilutamide and bicalutamide), or if they had received
bisphosphonates within 4 weeks of randomization.
Patients with central nervous system metastases or
with New York Heart Association grade 2 heart failure were excluded. Only patients who had signed an
informed consent form were enrolled, and the study
was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki under the supervision of institutional review
boards.
Study Design
The study consisted of a screening period no longer
than 35 days followed by a double-blind treatment
period. Enrolled patients were assigned randomly 1:1
to receive once-daily oral atrasentan 10 mg or placebo. Treatment continued until the patient experienced disease progression or discontinued study
drug or until the study was stopped. Patients who
experienced confirmed disease progression and those
who were active at the time the study was stopped
were eligible to receive open-label atrasentan in an
extension study.
Patients visited the study site on Days 1 and 14;
Weeks 4, 8, and 12; and every 12 weeks thereafter
until the final visit. Follow-up survival assessments

were performed every 12 weeks after discontinuation
and during the open-label extension. Serum BAP and
PSA values were measured at baseline; at Weeks 4, 8,
and 12; and every 12 weeks thereafter. Bone and CT/
MRI scans were obtained at screening. All patients
underwent follow-up bone scans at 12-week intervals; patients who had evidence of extraskeletal
metastases at baseline and, at the investigator’s discretion, had CT or MRI scans every 12 weeks.
Patients who experienced disease progression by any
measure were not followed for subsequent progression events.

Outcome Measures
The primary endpoint was time to disease progression in the ITT population. Disease progression was
defined as the first occurrence of any one of the
events summarized in Table 1, which included a rigorous composite of clinical and radiographic criteria.
An independent radiologist reviewed all scans, and
an independent oncologist confirmed all endpoints.
Secondary endpoints included change in BAP
values, time to PSA progression, mean rate of change

1961

in Bone Scan Index (BSI),23 and overall survival (OS).
The time to PSA progression was defined as the days
from randomization to the first of 2 consecutive
postbaseline measurements (at least 14 days apart)
that demonstrated a rise 50% from nadir. Patients
with both a baseline measurement and at least 2
postbaseline measurements were included in the
analysis. Tertiary analyses included time to BAP progression (defined the same as the time to PSA progression) and longitudinal analyses of PSA.
Safety assessments were performed on all
patients who received study drug and included evaluation of adverse events, vital sign measurements,
and laboratory analyses. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) regularly reviewed safety
and efficacy data.

Statistical Analysis
We estimated that 650 events would be needed to
achieve 90% power at the 2-sided .05 level of significance to detect a treatment difference of a magnitude similar to that demonstrated in the Phase 2 trial
for the ITT population (hazards ratio [HR], 0.77; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.55–1.09).20
Demographic and baseline variables were compared between groups. The Fisher exact test was
used to compare equality of proportions, and F tests
were used for equality of means for continuous variables. The primary endpoint was analyzed using the
weighted log-rank statistic, G1,1.24 All time-to-event
analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier methodology and the log-rank and G1,1 test statistics. Cox
proportional hazards modeling also was applied,
with HRs <1.00 favoring atrasentan. Ad hoc analyses
were conducted on the radiographic and clinical
components of the primary endpoint. In these analyses, patients were censored at the time of disease
progression for any reason and were not followed for
subsequent progression events. Mean changes from
baseline in biomarkers were analyzed using analysis
of covariance with treatment group and baseline
value as covariates. The Fisher exact test was used to
compare frequencies of adverse events between
treatment arms.

RESULTS
Disposition of Patients
Eight hundred nine patients were randomized to
receive either atrasentan (n 5 408) or placebo (n 5
401) and are included in the ITT cohort. Patients
ranged in age from 45 years to 93 years (mean age,
72 years), and 95% of patients were Caucasian. There
were no clinically meaningful differences between

treatment arms in baseline characteristics, including
factors with established prognostic importance in
prostate cancer (Table 2).25
Enrollment ceased at the recommendation of the
IDMC in September 2002 because, with 137 events
already accrued, they estimated that a sufficient
number of patients had been enrolled to achieve the
prespecified number of endpoint events. The committee subsequently recommended in February 2003
that the study be stopped, because it was unlikely to
achieve statistical significance in the primary analysis. The IDMC based their decision on 343 confirmed
events plus additional events not yet adjudicated.
Once all patients had completed final study visits
and undergone final imaging procedures, 610 disease
progression events had occurred.

Primary Endpoint
Protocol-defined disease progression was unexpectedly rapid in both treatment arms, with >50% of
patients demonstrating progression within 100 days
(Fig. 1). Estimates of progression were based on the
dose-ranging study, in which clinical investigators
determined progression without mandated radiographic scans every 12 weeks. In this study, the majority of progression events resulted from the
acquisition of new lesions on scheduled bone
scans, and most were identified on the first scan at
Week 12. Atrasentan did not affect the time to disease progression relative to placebo in the ITT
population (G1,1; P 5 .136) (Table 3). It is noteworthy that the vast majority of radiographic progression events (433 of 498 events; 87%) occurred

in the absence of any protocol-defined clinical progression event.

Secondary Endpoints
Baseline BAP values were similar in the 2 treatment
arms. The mean change at final assessment was an
increase of 13.2 ng/mL with atrasentan compared
with an increase of 33.9 ng/mL with placebo (P 5
.001). The time to PSA progression (requiring 2 consecutive increases of 50% from nadir) was longer with
atrasentan but did not reach statistical significance
(HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70–1.01). However, an additional
26% of patients had a single 50% increase in PSA, and
many of those men did not have a confirmatory test
because their initial PSA increase occurred at Week 12
or later, coincident with disease progression. Patients
were not followed for the next PSA assessment once
they experienced disease progression. In an exploratory analysis of the time to first 50% increase in PSA,
atrasentan significantly extended the time before PSA
progression (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73–1.00).
The survival analysis did not detect a difference
between treatment arms based on initial randomization; the median survival was 20.5 months for
patients who were randomized to the atrasentan arm
and 20.3 months for patients who were randomized
to the placebo arm. Interpretation of these results
was confounded by the extension study, in which
nearly 65% of patients from both randomized arms
received open-label atrasentan.
Tertiary Endpoints
Results for the time to BAP progression and for the
mean change from baseline PSA favored atrasentan
(Table 3). The median time to BAP progression was
nearly twice as long with atrasentan as with placebo
(505 days vs 254 days; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42–0.75).
Atrasentan significantly slowed the rise in mean PSA
at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and at the final visit compared with
placebo. The mean baseline PSA value for the atrasentan arm was 200.1 ng/mL with a mean increase
of 199.7 ng/mL at the final assessment; whereas the
mean baseline PSA value was 215.0 ng/mL for the
placebo arm with a greater mean increase from baseline of 290.7 ng/mL at the final assessment (P < .023).
Safety
Treatment with atrasentan was generally well tolerated, with 9% (36 of 404 patients) of atrasentan-treated patients discontinuing from the study primarily
because of an adverse event and without disease
progression compared with 6% (22 of 397 patients)
of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of grade 3
of 4 events (42% placebo, 40% atrasentan) was also

1963

similar between treatment arms, as were serious
adverse events (placebo arm, 26%; atrasentan arm,
29%) and deaths from treatment-emergent adverse
events (placebo arm, 5%; atrasentan arm, 6%)
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC), version 2.
Bone pain was the most common adverse event
and was reported more frequently with placebo (Table 4).
The most frequently reported adverse events that
were more common with atrasentan were peripheral
edema (40%), rhinitis (36%), and headache (21%),
which reflect the vasodilatory and/or fluid-retention
properties of ETA receptor antagonism (Table 4).
Overall, the incidence of most grade 3 or 4 adverse
events was similar between treatment groups. Bone
pain was more common with placebo, and heart failure was more common with atrasentan (Table 4).
The incidence of heart failure was higher with
atrasentan than with placebo (P 5 .002). Heart failure
likely caused by fluid overload also was observed in
the Phase 2 study and has been described in studies
of other endothelin antagonists in cardiac disease.21,26,27 Atrasentan recipients who experienced
heart failure generally were older and weighed less at
baseline than atrasentan-treated patients who did not
develop heart failure (mean age, 78 years vs 72.1
years; mean weight, 74.7 kg vs 84.3 kg). Most men (13
of 18 patients; 72%) had a significant cardiovascular
history, including previous congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and/or valvular heart disease. Heart failure tended to occur
within the first 2 months of dosing with atrasentan
(median time to onset, 35 days; range, 4–310 days).
Heart failure resolved for 50% of the atrasentan-treated patients, with most continuing or briefly interrupting atrasentan therapy and receiving appropriate
medication. Events for 4 patients resolved after
atrasentan discontinuation. Six atrasentan-treated
patients died from complications related to heart failure, although the clinical presentation was questionable for 3 of those patients, and 5 of them had very
advanced cancer at baseline (3 patients had visceral
metastases, and 2 had a BSI in the upper quartile).
Myocardial infarction (MI) also was reported
more frequently with atrasentan (9 of 404 patients;
2.2%) than with placebo (2 of 397 patients; 0.5%).
Five atrasentan recipients had MI concurrent with
heart failure. The incidence of fatal MI was similar
between treatment arms (2 deaths in the atrasentan
arm; 1 death in the placebo arm).

DISCUSSION
The current study did not demonstrate a significant
effect of atrasentan on delaying disease progression,

the primary endpoint, in the ITT population. Although
it could be concluded that the drug was ineffective
in this population, several aspects of the study, its
design and the data, are of interest. The results of
the earlier Phase 2 dose-ranging trial, which demonstrated that atrasentan was tolerable and delayed disease progression significantly in evaluable patients,
formed the basis for the current trial.21 From that
study, the 10 mg per day dose was selected, and estimates of progression were used to generate the statistical analysis for the current study. However,
because of the potential for rising PSA to trigger discretionary bone scans in patients with advanced
prostate cancer, the Phase 3 protocol required us to
schedule scans every 12 weeks. This singular difference in protocol design between the dose-ranging
study and the current study likely accounts for the
unexpected and rapid progression rates noted in
both the active and placebo treatment arms in this
trial. The dose-ranging study allowed investigators to
use clinical judgment to define progression and did
not mandate radiographic studies except to confirm
progression. In the study we report here, one consequence of the protocol-mandated bone scans was

that >50% of the patients reached protocol-defined
disease progression at the first scheduled scan,
although 87% did not experience concurrent clinical
progression. Although clinical practice varies widely
among institutions and countries, many of these
patients would not undergo 12-weekly scans in the
absence of clinical symptoms. The finding of bone
scan progression at the first 12-week time point in
some patients may reflect radiographic changes that
occurred before therapy was initiated or very early in
the course of therapy when a treatment effect would
not have been expected.
Therefore, although the protocol mandated regular scans to avoid PSA bias, the design actually precipitated endpoint acquisition. This, along with the
finding that patients were not followed beyond bone
scan progression for other progression events, ultimately limits the study’s ability to fully delineate the
clinical benefit of atrasentan in these patients. In
future studies, if bone scans are used, then changes
in an otherwise asymptomatic patient should be
deemed an endpoint only with a later confirmatory
scan that shows evidence of additional lesions. This
recommendation of a confirmatory second scan has

been presented as part of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group consensus for Phase 2 trials
in this patient population.28
Despite the lack of definitive clinical benefit in
the study, 2 results suggest potential activity with atrasentan. Particularly noteworthy are exploratory ad hoc
analyses of the separate radiographic and clinical
components of disease progression. Patients were
censored from subsequent analyses at the time of
their first event. Of the 411 patients who progressed
because of bone scan changes, only 42 patients (10%)
had pain. Of the 177 patients who progressed because
of a clinical event, only 65 patients (37%) progressed
with simultaneous radiographic events (52 patients
had a concurrent positive bone scan, 23 patients had
a concurrent positive CT scan; 10 patients had both
positive bone and CT scans). The time to onset of radiographic progression was similar between groups
(HR, 90; 95% CI, 0.76–1.08). In contrast, fewer clinical
progression events occurred with atrasentan (77 of
408 patients; 18.9%) than with placebo (100 of 401
patients; 24.9%), and atrasentan prolonged the onset
of these events (HR, 74; 95% CI, 0.55–1.00) (Fig. 2).
In these analyses, atrasentan reduced the risk of
clinical progression as the first progression event by
26%. Clinical progression, which was defined primarily as pain and skeletal-related events in this study,
represents the morbidity of late-stage HRPC. The
major limitation of these analyses, however, is that
patients who had radiographic progression without
clinical progression were censored when radiographic progression occurred. Therefore, these data
are difficult to interpret and require confirmation in
future studies.
A biologic effect with atrasentan is evident from
its slowing the increase of biomarkers of disease pro-

1965

gression, particularly BAP, in this population, which
may suggest targeted activity in the bone microenvironment. Multiple studies have demonstrated that
alkaline phosphatase is of equal value in predicting
prognosis for patients with advanced HRPC as the
extent of bone disease, pain, or performance.29,30 Exploratory subset analysis of the time to progression
in men with bone metastases, excluding those
patients with soft tissue disease only, demonstrated a
modest 19% reduction in the risk of progression (HR,
0.813; 95% CI, 0.658–0.965). Hence, this exploratory
finding forces the hypothesis that the target population for this agent is men with bony metastatic disease in the HRPC setting.
The most common adverse events associated
with atrasentan (peripheral edema, rhinitis, and
headache) were consistent with the vasoactive properties of the drug, and were generally mild, and
typically did not lead to drug discontinuation. In susceptible patients, however, fluid overload may result
in heart failure. Identifying the most vulnerable
patients—those aged >75 years with a significant
cardiovascular history and early administration of
diuretics—may mitigate the risk.
Although this study did not meet the primary
endpoint, the overall body of data, including the consistency across secondary, tertiary, and ad hoc analyses, provides evidence for the potential clinical
benefit of atrasentan in men with metastatic HRPC.
For all analyses, the outcomes favored atrasentan.
Taken together, the results of the current trial are
consistent with the mechanism of action of atrasentan. The ET axis plays a role in prostate cancer progression as well as in the dysregulated bone
remodeling typical of metastatic HRPC. The ETA receptor mediates the epithelial cancer-related activities of ET-1, including inhibition of apoptosis, bone
matrix remodeling, and nociception.5,31–35 The results
of the current trial add to this body of knowledge,
demonstrating that atrasentan may slow the onset of
morbidity manifest as cancer-related pain, skeletalrelated events, and clinical complications of metastatic disease in men with HRPC. The study design
and prior assumptions of progression rates may have
limited the ability to fully define the benefit with atrasentan. In addition, early endpoints of radiographic
progression shortened the average duration of exposure to both atrasentan and placebo, thus limiting observation of longer term treatment differences.
However, the activity of atrasentan, particularly the
potential effect on delaying disease progression
measured by clinical criteria or the exploratory finding that suggests a modest clinical benefit in men
with bone metastases, warrants further evaluation in

prospective randomized controlled trials. A trial sponsored by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG0421) in patients with HRPC who have bone metastases is underway to evaluate the possible synergistic
effect of atrasentan in combination with docetaxel.
