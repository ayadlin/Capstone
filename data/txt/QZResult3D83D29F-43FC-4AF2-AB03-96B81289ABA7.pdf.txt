Abstract:

Inhibitors of angiogenesis are an important addition to conventional chemotherapy.
Among different “druggable” angiogenic factors, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is an attractive target for novel therapies because of its intricated involvement
in tumor neovascularization, tumor cell proliferation and migration, and the
acquisition of resistance to antiangiogenic therapies. FGF-2 bioavailability and
activity is affected by several natural ligands, including the endogenous inhibitor of
angiogenesis thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). We hypothesized that the FGF-2-binding
sequence of TSP-1 might serve as a template for the development of non-peptide
inhibitors of angiogenesis. Computational biology and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy approaches, major investigative tools in the characterizations
of protein-protein interaction (PPI), were used to map the residues at the TSP1/FGF-2 interface. The translation of this three-dimensional information into
a pharmacophore model allowed screening a small molecule databases,
identifying three FGF-2-binding, antiangiogenic small molecules, mimetic of TSP1. Pharmacophore-based approaches are thus feasible tools to exploit naturally
occurring PPI, by generating a set of lead compounds mimetic of endogenous
proteins, as a starting point for the development of novel therapeutic agents.

Introduction

(“evasive”) resistance to these agents resulting from a
concurrence of causes including tumor adaptation to
growth in an angiogenesis-independent manner, selection
of more malignant and invasive tumor cells by therapyinduced hypoxia, and increased production of angiogenic
factors, equal and/or different from the targeted one [3].
Several approaches have been proposed to overcome
resistance. The optimization of schedule of administration
and length of treatment with the antiangiogenic agents is
certainly a relevant issue. In addition, the simultaneous
targeting of different angiogenesis pathways is another
possible approach to overcome the arising of resistance.
So far, the antiangiogenic agents approved for clinical
use target (exclusively or preferentially) VEGF. The
design of agents targeting other angiogenic factors is

Angiogenesis has become a successful target in
cancer therapy [1]. Designed to target the formation of
a functional vascular network – a requirement for the
malignant progression -, antiangiogenic agents impair
tumor growth and metastatic dissemination [2]. These
drugs, mostly inhibitors of the angiogenic factor vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have become important
tools in the clinical practice, usually in combination with
conventional chemotherapy. However, antiangiogenic
therapies still cause only a modest increment of overall
survival, and often present relevant toxic effects. The lack
of long-lasting therapeutic effects of the antiangiogenic
therapies in neoplastic patients is due to acquired

becoming a promising field for the development of novel
antiangiogenic compounds, further supported by the
evidence of selective, non-redundant roles of the different
angiogenic factors produced by tumors in promoting not
only tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, but also the
direct growth and invasion of tumor cells [4]. Therefore
each angiogenic factor represents an important target for
therapy of tumors, challenged or not with antiangiogenic
therapies.

producing cells (leukocytes, tumor, and stromal cells) can
been achieved by antisense or dominant negative cDNAs
approaches. Interestingly, chemotherapeutics have been
demonstrated to inhibit FGF production, mainly by
affecting FGF-producing tumor cells.
Once produced and released, FGFs can be sequestered
in the extracellular space preventing their paracrine or
autocrine stimulation of target cells. This can be achieved
with anti-FGFs antibodies or with FGF traps, designed
to mimic FGF-sequestering molecules. The finding that
the released, soluble extracellular portion of the FGFR1
binds FGF-2 and prevents FGF-2/FGFR1 interaction has
led to the design of FP-1039, a soluble fusion protein that
consists of extracellular FGFR1-IIIc domain fused to the
Fc domain of IgG1.
Heparin, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan
released in the blood stream during inflammation,
sequesters FGFs in the extracellular environment,
efficiently competing for the binding of the growth factor to
HSPGs. Although it exerts a potent FGF-antagonist effect,
unmodified heparin cannot be used as an anti-angiogenic
drug because of its anticoagulant activity and binding to
a wide array of physiological molecules. This prompted
the development of synthetic heparin derivatives and
heparin-like molecules (such as the prototypic suramin)
endowed with a more specific FGF-antagonist activity
and a more favorable therapeutic window (reviewed
in [12, 13]). Among structurally different derivatives,
Gentisic acid (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid), a widespread
plant secondary metabolite and a catabolite of aspirin,
binds the heparin-binding site of FGF and has been used
as a template to develop inhibitors of angiogenesis [14].
FGF receptors and ligands (including FGFRs,
HSPGs, integrins and gangliosides) are important targets
to block FGFs activity. The binding of FGFs to their
FGFRs can be neutralized by specific antibodies directed
against the receptors or by protamine or synthetic peptides
corresponding to the receptor recognition sequences of
FGFs. HSPGs can be masked by protamine, histidine-rich
glycoprotein, PF4, endostatin and kallistatin. IntegrinsFGF interactions are masked by synthetic peptides,
peptidomimetics and disintegrins (a class of naturally
occurring integrin antagonists) containing integrinrecognition motifs such as RGD. Finally, the cholera
toxin B subunit binds to cell surface GM1 ganglioside
hampering its interaction with FGF-2 thus inhibiting FGF2-dependent pro-angiogenic activation of endothelial
cells.
The blockage of FGF activity can be achieved by
hampering the expression of the various FGF receptors
on target cells, including FGFRs, HSPGs, integrins,
and gangliosides. FGFRs expression can be reduced
by antisense cDNA, the synthetic retinoid fenretinide,
and antibodies directed against αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins.
Perlecan antisense cDNA and lead exposure cause HSPG
downregulation. Finally, inhibitors of the synthesis of

Angiogenic growth factors as
targets: the prototype FGF-2
Numerous inducers of angiogenesis have been
identified, including the members of the already
mentioned VEGF family, hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), angiopoietins, transforming growth factor-α
and -β (TGF-α and -β), platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins,
chemokines, and the members of the fibroblast growth
factor (FGF) family [1, 2, 5].
Beside VEGFs, FGFs are recognized targets for the
development of anti-cancer therapy [6, 7]. FGF-2 has
been the first tumor-associated angiogenic factor to be
purified [8]. Since then, an increasing amount of evidence
has accumulated supporting the involvement of FGFs
in different steps of cancer progression. Overexpression
or genetic alterations lead to a deregulated activation of
FGF/FGF receptor pathways in cancer [7]. Plasma levels
of FGFs are frequently elevated in cancer patients, in some
cases associated with tumor escape from antiangiogenic
therapy [9]. Evidences indicate that FGFs, produced by
both tumor or host cells, promote tumor progression
both directly, by affecting tumor cell differentiation,
proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis, response
to chemotherapy and cancer stem cell self-renewal,
and indirectly, by inducing angiogenesis as well as the
recruitment and activation of tumor-supporting stromal
cells [6, 7]. Therefore targeting FGFs has a multivalent
value as a way to simultaneously affect different pathways
associated with both tumor progression, angiogenesis,
host cells recruitment and tumor resistance.
At present, 22 structurally-related members of the
FGF family have been identified, including 18 FGFs
(defined as FGF receptor ligands) and 4 FGF-homologous
factors [6, 7, 10]. FGFs are pleiotropic factors that act on
different cell types in autocrine, paracrine of juxtacrine
manners, through different receptors, including tyrosine
kinase (TK) receptors (FGFRs), heparan-sulfate
proteoglycans (HSPGs), integrins, and gangliosides.
Among the paracrine FGFs, FGF-1, 2, 4, 5 and 8 have
pro-angiogenic activity [11].
The angiogenic activity of FGFs can be neutralized
by different strategies, schematized in Figure 1. For a
detailed review see [6, 7, 12].

complex gangliosides, including fumonisin B1, D-threo-1phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, and
D-1-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino1-propanol, inhibit EC proliferation triggered by FGF-2.
The TK activity of angiogenic factor receptors is a
successful strategy to affect angiogenesis, as shown by
the number of TK inhibitors that have been subjected
to clinical trials or approved in the last decade. Most
TK inhibitors have a broad-spectrum activity, affecting
multiple receptors and pathways, as in the case of
SU5402, that targets both VEGFR-2 and FGFR1. Efforts
are currently ongoing to design TK inhibitors selective for
the FGFRs, such as PD173074, selective for FGFR1 and
FGFR3 [6, 7]. Recently, structure-guided approaches are
being used to introduce focused structural changes and
optimize potency and selectivity of TK inhibitors [15].
Intracellular signals activated by FGFs in tumor
cells or ECs might be considered targets for angiogenesis
inhibitors. A long list of synthetic compounds, dominant
negative mutants or antisense cDNAs targeting FGFsdependent signalling pathways has been described.
Finally, the “pro-angiogenic phenotype” induced by FGF-

antiangiogenic agents: TSP-1
Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis have evolved
as the optimal physiological control of the angiogenic
process. It is therefore logical to consider them as models
for the design of antiangiogenic therapies [16]. This
heterogeneous group of molecules includes proteins,
polysaccharides and glycosphingolipids found in the body
fluids and ECM.
Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) was the first endogenous
inhibitor of angiogenesis to be identified [17, 18]. Of the
5 members that compose the TSP family in mammals,
TSP-1 and TSP-2 (forming the group A, homotrimeric
TSPs) are similar in domain organization and share the
ability to inhibit angiogenesis. TSPs are modular proteins.

proteolytic digestion of TSP-1 generates active fragments
which are still able to interact with their ligands, without
however generating large molecular complexes, and
hence with functional consequences different from
entire TSP (Figure 2). The generation of antiangiogenic
fragment of TSP-1 by proteases has been described [24],
and indeed, proteolytic degradation of large molecules
is emerging as an important mechanism to generate
inhibitors of angiogenesis [25]. In the case of TSPs, it
can be anticipated that antiangiogenic fragments might
be characterized and taken as models for the design of
inhibitors of angiogenesis.
TSP-1 can inhibit angiogenesis both directly and
indirectly [26]. As a direct inhibitor it interacts with
specific receptors on endothelial cells (including CD36,
CD47, integrins, HSPG, and LRP) to affect cell viability
and functions related to angiogenesis. Besides endothelial
cells, TSP-1 is also active on other cell types involved in
the angiogenic process, including smooth muscle cells,
monocytes/macrophages and T cells. Finally, TSP-1
has been reported to decrease the mobilization of viable
circulating endothelial cells and putative endothelial
progenitor cells [27].

domain, followed by the coiled-coil oligomerization
domain, a von Willebrand Factor type C, procollagen
domain, three properdin-like type I repeats, and a
signature domain comprising three epidermal growth
factor (EGF)-like type II repeats, a calcium-binding wire
- type III repeats, and the lectin-like C-terminal globular
domain [19].
TSP-1 is a matricellular protein, i.e. a non-structural
extracellular protein that acts to regulate cell interactions
with the environment [20]. Through its different domains,
TSP-1 is able to interact simultaneously with different
cell receptors, soluble cytokines and growth factors,
extracellular matrix components, and proteases. This
accounts for the pleiotropic nature of TSP-1, which,
depending on the environmental properties (presence of
receptors, ligands, proteases) can have different effects even opposite - on cell activities and biological process
[21-23]. Such a large, modular protein has the potential to
aggregate molecular complexes at the pericellular level,
acting as a scaffold that place in close proximity soluble
molecules, growth factors, proteases and recruited cell
receptors, ultimately orchestrating a complex signaling
cascade within the cells (Figure 2). On the other hand,

Exploiting
protein-protein
interactions in drug discovery

As an indirect inhibitor, TSP-1 binds and modulates
the activity/bioavailability of different mediators of
angiogenesis, such as angiogenic factors, cytokines and
proteases. The interaction of TSP-1 with the angiogenic
factors FGF-2, VEGF, HGF, PDGF and the viral protein
Tat [28-32], might be viewed as a general mechanism of
angiogenesis regulation and thus a paradigm for designing
therapeutic intervention.
Different therapeutic approaches have been
proposed to exploit the antiangiogenic properties of TSP1 (reviewed in [33-35]). Increased levels of TSP-1 have
been obtained by gene therapy approaches, based on
viral and non-viral vectors, designed to grant the constant
delivery of the antiangiogenic factors necessary for an
effective control of angiogenesis [36, 37]. Alternatively,
different classes of antiangiogenic compounds stimulate
TSP-1 production, including fenofibrate, thrichostatin-A,
retinoic acid, inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases and
histone deacetylases (see [33, 34] and references therein).
Interestingly, an increase in TSP-1 production has been
indicated as the main mechanism of the antiangiogenic
activity of metronomic chemotherapy, the frequent
administration of low dose chemotherapy proposed to
optimize the antiangiogenic property of chemotherapeutics
[38, 39].
Different antiangiogenic sequences have been
identified in TSP-1, each offering a potential tool for
therapeutic exploitation [34, 35]. Synthetic peptides based
on the active sequences of TSP-1 have antiangiogenic
and antineoplastic activity. Chemical modifications - such
as use of non-natural amino-acids, cyclization, linkage
to proteins, retro-inverso analogues, or polysucrose
conjugates - can be successfully used to increase peptide
stability, bioavailability, potency, tumor targeting ability,
and to improve pharmacokinetics/pharmacodinamics
(PK/PD) [23, 40-42]. Two TSP-1-based peptido-mimetics
developed as antiangiogenic agents for antineoplastic
therapy, have reached clinical trials, ABT510 and
CVX-045. ABT-510 is a modified peptide, based on the
7-mer active sequence GVITRIR present in the second
type I repeat of TSP-1 [41]. It induced endothelial cell
apoptosis in vitro and inhibited angiogenesis in in vivo
assays [43]. ABT-510 and the related peptide ABT-526
inhibited tumor growth and reduced microvessel density
in preclinical tumor models [43-45], and were particularly
active in combination with chemotherapy [46, 47] or
other antiangiogenic agents [48]. CVX-045 is a fusion
molecule, produced by covalently attaching two TSP-1
mimetic nonamer peptides to the Fab binding site of a
humanized scaffold antibody, which endows the molecule
with the advantageous PK of antibodies. CVX-045 has
been reported active in xenograft tumor models, both as
single treatment and in combination regimens [49].

The TSP-1/FGF-2 interaction and its exploitation
in the design of inhibitor peptide sequences represents a
paradigmatic example of how the knowledge of naturally
occurring protein-protein interactions can be exploited in
the discovery of new drug-like inhibitors.
Indeed, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play
fundamental roles in all biological processes, and underlie
a wide variety of complex pathways fundamental for
either the correct functioning of cells or the development
of pathological conditions [50]. As a consequence, it is
not surprising that over the last few years the study and
targeting of protein-protein interactions has attracted ever
growing attention [51].
The development and success of structural
and functional genomics initiatives combined to the
improvements in proteomics and bioinformatics have
provided a wealth of structural and functional information
on PPI’s [52-54]. This information can now be used to
discover small molecules that mimic the functions of one
of the two binding partners, thus acting as antagonists or
regulators in pathways where a certain PPI is particularly
relevant.
However, targeting protein-protein interaction
interfaces has proven to be a challenging task in drug
discovery [55]. The contact surfaces may indeed be large
and rather flat, compared to the well-defined cavities
that are typically exploited in targeting enzyme active
sites in classical drug discovery efforts. Moreover, in
many cases, most of the contacts defining the surfaces
involve aminoacids that are not contiguous in the primary
sequence. Consequently, peptides derived from short
sequences may represent poor starting points from the
medicinal chemistry point of view. In the same frame of
thought, in most cases, there is no natural small molecule
partner that either mediates or takes part in proteinprotein interactions. Thus, in contrast to the development
of enzyme inhibitors, there is no small molecule substrate
or ligand to use as a starting point for modifications or
mimics-development.
Despite all these hurdles, several success stories
have emerged that provide confidence in the quest for
small molecule inhibitors of PPI’s.
Great impulse to this has come from the availability
of a number of high resolution X-ray structures of proteinprotein complexes and from the study of the effects of
complex formation on the conformational properties
of the partners from NMR experiments [56, 57]. The
combination of this structural information with the results
of mutational studies has helped identify small-subsets of
residues contributing most of the free energy of complex
stabilization. The chemical properties and positioning of
these “hot spots” can then be exploited as templates for
the design of new small-molecules, as targets for fragment

binding partners to each other and/or differences in the
solution behavior compared to the X-ray situation in
the small molecule selection process has the potential to
extend the chemical space of PPI inhibitors suggesting
new structures, chemotypes and ultimately drugs [62-64].
Computational studies have to be validated
experimentally to be really helpful in the context of
rational drug design. NMR has recently emerged as
a high-throughput experimental technique in drug
discovery, in determining possible binding affinities and
in characterizing the regions of interaction. NMR analysis
helps selecting and filtering only those conformations that
verify specific structural constraints obtained in solution
at equilibrium, recapitulating ensemble properties that
are specific only to selected molecular configurations. In
particular the recent development of new exchange-based
methods makes NMR spectroscopy a unique tool for
accessing huge and heterogeneous systems reducing or
eliminating the molecular weight limitations for receptors
in interaction studies. These methods, giving exchangetransferred structural information at high sensitivity on
receptor-bound ligands from unbound-state resonances,
are very useful to study the interactions of small molecules
or proteins with very large systems, with no need of
labeling [65-67].
Overall, these concepts provide a solid basis to
integrate structural, dynamic, biochemical and molecular
biology information explicitly in the drug discovery
process. In this context, the molecular information on

based drug development or for focusing high throughput
screening campaigns.
The analysis of the properties of protein-protein
complexes, combined to mutational scanning has
led to the development of inhibitors of the cytokine
Interleukin-2 [58] binding to its receptor. Another
example is represented by the members of the B-cell
lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family. These proteins, indicated as
Bcl-XL are important regulators of apoptosis. They form
homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the
family generating antiapoptotic complexes, important
in tumor development and progression [59]. Analyzing
the binding of these proteins to specific helical regions
of BAK of BAD, it was possible to develop and design
small molecules able to selectively disrupt the target
protein-protein interactions with important anticancer
activities [60]. Similar approaches have been applied to
identify new inhibitors of the p53-HDM2 interactions or
disruptors of TNF dimers [61].
An important development for the discovery of
new PPI inhibitors may stem from the realization that
interacting surfaces are not static. Rather, they are highly
dynamic. Computational methods, mainly based on
all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations, now offer
unprecedented possibilities to design molecules and
pharmacophore models that target flexible receptors,
taking multiple different conformational states available
on the protein’s energy landscape. Including an atomic
level resolution description of the adaptation of the two

TSP-1/FGF-2 binding has been exploited to discover new
inhibitors of angiogenesis.

In order to exploit the FGF-2-binding region of
TSP-1, we first needed to identify the FGF-2-binding
sequence. We therefore designed an approach allowing
the identification of progressively smaller FGF-2biding site in TSP-1. Thrombin-generated, proteolytic
fragments of TSP-1 were first used, and showed that
the FGF-2-binding ability was retained by the 140 kDa
carboxy-terminal domain [29, 30]. Using recombinant
portions of TSP-1, we identified a previously undescribed
antiangiogenic site in the type III repeats of TSP-1, and
demonstrated that binding of the angiogenic factor FGF-2
to this site inhibits angiogenesis by sequestration of FGF2 [31]. Finally, the peptide array technology allowed us to
identify three potentially active linear sequences involved
in the interaction of FGF-2 with the type III repeats of
TSP-1 [68]. Binding experiments and SPR analysis with
synthetic peptides corresponding to these sequences
indicated that one of them, DDDDDNDKIPDDRDN
(residues 739-753; named DD15) indeed bound FGF2 with a Kd of 28.0 µM. In agreement with previous
findings showing that TSP-1 impaired FGF-2 interaction
with heparin, molecular dynamics (MD) analysis of the

Exploitation of the FGF-2-binding
sequence of TSP-1 for the design
of antiangiogenic compounds
As mentioned above, a common aspect of a number
of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, including TSP1, is the ability to bind and sequester angiogenic factors.
Our work hypothesis was therefore to characterize and
exploit this property of TSP-1 to design inhibitors of
angiogenesis (Figure 3).
TSP-1 binds FGF-2, with high affinity (in the
nanomolar range), similar to the affinity of the growth
factor for heparin [29, 31]. Consequently to this
interaction, TSP-1 prevents FGF-2 binding to HSPG in the
extracellular matrix and on the surface of endothelial cells
[30], inhibiting FGF-2-mediated pro-angiogenic activation
of endothelial cells, and depleting the extracellular matrix
of stored FGF-2, an important component in the process
of neovascularization [29, 30].

DD15/FGF-2 complex indicated that the peptide adopted
an extended conformation over FGF-2 binding surface,
occupying the heparin-binding site, with favorable
electrostatic couplings between the Lys sidechains on the
surface of FGF-2 and the negatively charged Asp groups
of DD15.
Once a bioactive protein sequence is identified,
two main approaches can be undertaken to develop
active mimicking compounds: i) the design of natural or
modified synthetic peptides or ii) the development of nonpeptidic mimetic small molecules. In our case, the former
option was hindered by the poor affinity of the peptide
for FGF-2, and by the general poor pharmacological
properties of peptides. We thus decided to undertake a
search for non-peptidic, small molecule mimetic of TSP1, using a pharmacophore-based approach that allows
a high-throughput search of molecules presenting the
correct spatial geometry of the functional groups required
for target recognition. The power of this approach is the
possibility of selecting chemically different compounds
having the same target recognition and biological activity,
therefore offering broad possibilities of lead selection for
future pharmacological development.
The information independently obtained by MD
simulations and experimental NMR data was combined
to provide a cross-validated and cross-filtered atomic
resolution model of the complementary interactions
within the binding site. The results of extensive allatom MD simulations provided a statistically weighted
description of the most relevant interactions defining
binding. It is worth noting that this MD-based approach
was developed to analyze the complex interface while
taking account of conformational dynamics and motional
flexibility of both binding partners and focusing in
particular on hydrogen-bonding, hydrophobic/aromatic,
and charge-charge interaction [68]. NMR analysis, based
on Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) experiments
[65], identified and confirmed the identity of the peptide
residues making interaction with FGF-2. Altogether, MD
and NMR analyses yielded a consistent identification of
DD15 residues mostly involved in the recognition of FGF2 and stabilization of the complex, indicating that both
hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions are relevant to
the interaction.
After analyzing the MD trajectories, the groups of
DD15 mostly involved in stabilizing the complex with
FGF-2 and their average relative positioning were identified
and this information translated into a pharmacophore
model that recapitulated the minimal functional and
stereochemical requirements needed by a molecule to
bind FGF-2. In particular, three pharmacophoric points
were considered: two negative ionizable functionalities
mapped over the carboxy groups of Asp741 and Asp750,
and one five- or six-membered ring moiety mapped on the
position of the corresponding ring of Pro748, to mimic
the peptide hydrophobic patch defined by Ile747-Pro748
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and provide structural rigidity to hits. The pharmacophore
was used to screen the NCI2003 database of molecules
(Developmental Therapeutics Program NCI/NIH). This
search yielded 42 molecules. Nineteen of them, made
available from the NCI (Rockville, MD) were subjected
to experimental analysis of FGF-2 binding. Three
molecules (named sm8, sm27, and sm10, Figure 4) were
indeed able to bind FGF-2 with Kd ranging from 0.4 to
34 µM). Importantly, the small molecules retained the
antiangiogenic activity of the entire TSP-1 and the type
III repeats, as they prevented the binding of FGF-2 to
endothelial cells and inhibited FGF-2-induced endothelial
cell proliferation. Moreover, the most active molecule,
sm27, inhibited FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in the
chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay[68].
Interestingly these molecules met the stereochemical
rules, obtained through a totally different approach,
proposed to develop naphthalene sulfonates as FGF
inhibitors [69]. In an attempt to identify new naphthalene
derivatives that combine the highest inhibitory activity
with the lowest toxicity, Fernandez-Tornero and coworkers
explored a wide window of charge, size and relative
position of substituents of the naphthalene ring This
study allowed formulating the following stereochemical
rules that may constitute the basis for the development of
new antiangiogenesis treatments: 1) the sulfonate group
should preferentially be located at position 2 rather than 1
of the planar aromatic ring of naphthalene; 2) derivatives
containing one amino group at positions 5 or 6 are better
inhibitors of aFGF mitogenic activity; 3) the size of the
functional group at position 5 or 6 seems very relevant,
because a significant impairment was evident when a
bulky amide is introduced
It is interesting to make a comparative analysis
between the structure/inhibition relationship of the most
active compound found by Fernandez-Tornero and
coworkers, the sodium 5-amino-2-naphthelenesulfonic
acid (C9) and those of the most active (sm8 and sm27) and
the less active (sm10) leads identified by our group [68]
(Figure 4). The half-maximum inhibitory activity of sm27
(IC50 = 20 µM ) is more than one order of magnitude
lower than that of C9 (265 µM). Indeed, both sulfonate
groups are located at position 2 and both amino groups
at position 6, in good agreement with the stereochemical
rules formulated. The half-maximum inhibitory activity of
sm8 (IC50 = 67.8 µM) is four times lower than that of C9,
but three times higher than that of sm27. These features
might be rationalized considering that, even if the size and
functional groups are exactly the same, only one sulfonate
group is located at the right position 2 in sm8 (the other
one being at the wrong position 3) and only one amino
group is located at the right position 6, while the other
one is at the wrong position 7. Finally sm10, which does
not respect at all the mentioned stereochemical rules, is
endowed with modest inhibitory effect.
Our approach has allowed the identification of active

other proteins or protein fragments able to interact with
angiogenic factors, and possibly to the identification of
a class of inhibitors sharing a similar structure/activity.
Moreover, since FGF-2 is not only an angiogenic factor,
but also a major promoter of tumor cell malignant behavior,
the possibility exists that TSP-1, DD15 and sm27 have
a direct anti-invasive and anti-metastatic activity, that
warrants further investigation.
Finally, we think it is important to underline that
our data, together with the results from other groups,
demonstrate that exploiting the new knowledge on
PPIs important for the regulation of angiogenesis, the
integration of different levels of information ranging
from the functional level to the dynamic determinants of
specific molecular recognition events may ultimately spur
the discovery of new drug classes active on challenging
targets, overcoming the limitations and difficulties of
classical drug design efforts.

small molecules mimetic of TSP-1. These leads cannot
yet be considered real drug candidates, and additional
efforts are required to further derivatize the leads through
a combination of combinatorial chemistry, molecular
dynamics and docking approaches guided by NMR
experimental restraints, to improve on their drug-like
properties and FGF-2 targeting affinity and specificity. The
latter issue is particularly important, since the possibility
exists that small molecules might partially lose the high
specificity typical of peptides and eventually interact with
additional targets originally not recognized by the peptide.
We believe that our study has confirmed the
reliability of the pharmacophore-based strategy to develop
active compounds mimetic of endogenous inhibitors for
pharmacologic use. Other studies integrating 3D structural
and the screening of libraries of natural products led to
the discovery of a new chemical class of FGF inhibitors.
Combining screening, X-ray structure determination
and NMR studies to cell biology methods, proliferation
assays and angiogenesis assays Gimenez-Gallego and
coworkers [14] were able to identify Gentisic acid
derivative as possible starting points for the development
of angiogenesis inhibitors with promising therapeutic
properties in vivo.

Conclusions
The identification of TSP-1-mimetic antiangiogenic
leads support the hypothesis that integrated
multidisciplinary approaches can be successfully used
to develop non-peptidic small molecule mimics of
endogenous proteins as therapeutic agents. These leads
represent a starting point for the future development of
antiangiogenic agents.
This study opens new themes of investigations.
Heparin recognition is a common feature of angiogenic
factors. It is therefore conceivable that TSP-1, its active
sequence DD15 and the identified small molecule sm27
would bind and inhibit the activity of other angiogenic
factors. Should this be the case, a compound similar
to sm27 might be envisioned as a general recognition
backbone for heparin-binding angiogenic factors,
whereas further chemical modification might be designed
to tune its selectivity for specific angiogenic factors. In
this respect, it is worth noting that the structure of sm27
closely mirror that of Surfen [70]. The positively charged
groups of Surfen which substitute the negatively groups
of sm27, confers Surfen with the ability to bind to HSPG
blocking their interactions with FGF-2. This indicates that
the common backbone shared by Surfen and sm27 might
indeed meet the correct spacial requirements to interfere
with protein/HSPG interaction.
Another potential area of research is the analysis
of sequences similar to DD15 present in other proteins,
including members of the TSP family as well as proteins
unrelated to TSPs. This might lead to the recognition of
