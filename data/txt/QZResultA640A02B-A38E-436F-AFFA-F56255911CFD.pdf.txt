Abstract
Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal disorder that affects neural crest-derived tissues, leading to a
wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Patients commonly present with plexiform neuroﬁbromas, benign but
debilitating growths that can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), a main cause of
mortality. Currently, surgery is the primary course of treatment for MPNST, but with the limitation that these
tumors are highly invasive. Radiotherapy is another treatment option, but is undesirable because it can induce
additional mutations. Patients with MPNST may also receive doxorubicin as therapy, but this DNA-intercalating
agent has relatively low tumor speciﬁcity and limited efﬁcacy. In this study, we exploited a robust genetically
engineered mouse model of MPNST that recapitulates human NF1-associated MPNST to identify a novel small
chemical compound that inhibits tumor cell growth. Compound 21 (Cpd21) inhibits growth of all available in vitro
models of MPNST and human MPNST cell lines, while remaining nontoxic to normally dividing Schwann cells or
mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts. We show that this compound delays the cell cycle and leads to cellular apoptosis.
Moreover, Cpd21 can reduce MPNST burden in a mouse allograft model, underscoring the compound's potential
as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. Cancer Res; 74(2); 586–97. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroﬁbromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant
genetic disorder that affects 1 in 3,500 people (1). Patients
typically present with a constellation of signs, including cafeau-lait pigmentation spots, benign neuroﬁbromas, axillary or
inguinal freckling, optic gliomas, Lisch nodules in the eye, bone
abnormalities, and multiple additional less penetrant manifestations (2). Furthermore, NF1 patients are predisposed to
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST; ref. 3),
which are a signiﬁcant source of mortality.
Neuroﬁbromas are benign tumors that grow on the skin
(dermal) or inside the body (plexiform; ref. 4). Neuroﬁbromas
have complex cellularity, including Schwann lineage cells, ﬁbroblasts, perineurial cells, mast cells, collagen deposits, and physical proximity to peripheral nerves. Plexiform neuroﬁbromas
appear in 30% of NF1 patients (5), and although they retain the
capacity to enlarge throughout life, many lines of evidence point
to an embryonic origin (4). Dermal neuroﬁbromas can arise from

a type of adult stem cell called skin-derived precursors (SKP;
ref. 4), whereas plexiform neuroﬁbromas arise from embryonic
neural crest lineage Schwann cell progenitors (6). Whether the
two cell types are related or the same remains unclear (7).
NF1 patients can also develop malignant tumors, including
leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma in children
(2). The most common malignancy, however, is MPNST, which
arises from and appears in, approximately 9% to 21% of
patients with plexiform neuroﬁbromas (8). MPNSTs are initially difﬁcult to detect, metastasize widely, and have a poor
prognosis (9). Mutation of Nf1, which encodes a RAS-GTPase
activating enzyme (10), is known to activate RAS downstream
effectors, including the ERK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways (11–
15). The two most common cancer-associated mutations
present in MPNSTs in addition to Nf1 mutation are the tumor
suppressors p53 (16–18) and CDKN2 (16, 19–23). Mice harboring mutated Nf1 and p53 or Nf1 and Cdkn2 spontaneously
develop MPNST (24, 25). In addition to Nf1 and its downstream
effector Ras, the conditional deletion of Pten also leads to
MPNST in mice (26).
In this study, we exploit a robust model of MPNST that
histologically and molecularly recapitulates human MPNST.
We used primary cells from these MPNSTs to screen for
compounds that speciﬁcally arrest tumor cell growth. Such
compounds would not only have potential as a platform for
novel therapeutic development but also for probing the biology
of MPNST. Elucidating the mechanism of action of such
compounds could identify MPNST speciﬁc pathways and
point to therapeutic opportunities. We report a novel small

molecule, compound 21 (Cpd21 or identiﬁcation number
SW106065), which induces apoptosis in all models of MPNST
tested but spares normal cells and tissues. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this compound can decrease the tumor
burden of MPNST in a mouse allograft model.

Materials and Methods
Cell and tissue samples
S462 and SNF96.2 cells were a gift from Karen Cichowski.
Schwann cells (ScienCell) were cultured in Schwann Cell Medium (ScienCell) and were immortalized with Myc-retrovirus (27).
High-throughput screening
sMPNST and Schwann cells (400 cells/well) were seeded in
384-well plates and grown overnight. Compounds (ﬁnal concentration of 2.5 mmol/L) were added and incubated for 96
hours. CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was added and luminescence
was quantiﬁed using Envision 2102 Multilabel Reader (Perkin
Elmer).
Soft agar assay
Acellular layer of 0.6% Bacto-agar in MPNST media was
plated. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, resuspended, mixed in
1:1 ratio with 0.6% agar to a ﬁnal density of 1  104 cells/mL,
and plated on top. After incubation for 10 days, colonies were
stained with 0.5 mL 0.005% crystal violet.
Cell-cycle analysis
BrdUrd (10 mmol/L) was added to cells for 30 minutes. Cells
were collected, resuspended in 100 mL PBS, ﬁxed in 5 mL ice-cold
ethanol, and then stored overnight at 4 C. 2N HCl/Triton X-100
was added to denature DNA. After neutralization, samples were
incubated with 50 mL 0.5% Tween 20/1%BSA/PBS, 20 mL antiBrdU-FITC (BD Biosciences), and 5 mL of 10 mg/mL RNAse
overnight. Samples were pelleted, resuspended in 1 mL 5 mg/mL
propidium iodide (Sigma), and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Western blotting
Cells were collected, trypsinized, and lysed with 600 mL
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Samples were run on
5%–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). The following primary antibodies were used: Cyclin D1, H3 (Millipore), Caspase-3, pERK,
ERK, pAKT, AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), PARP (Novus
Biologicals and Millipore), a-Tubulin (Sigma), and GAPDH
(Santa Cruz).
Annexin V staining
Floating and adherent cells were resuspended in binding
buffer (0.01 mol/L Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.14 mol/L NaCl, 2.5
mmol/L CaCl2), and processed according to manufacturer
(MACS Miltenyi Biotec). Three hundred microliters of suspension was added to 5 mL Annexin V antibody (MACS Miltenyi
Biotec) and 2.5 mL propidium iodide, and analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry.
Metabolic stability studies
Cpd21 levels for metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic studies were monitored by liquid chromatography

www.aacrjournals.org

(LC/MS-MS) with AB/Sciex (Applied Biosystems) 3200
Qtrap mass spectrometer coupled to Shimadzu Prominence
LC. Cpd21 was detected with the mass spectrometer in
positive MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode by
following the precursor to fragment ion transition 205.0 to
111.1. An Agilent C18 XDB 5 mm packing column (50  4.6
mm) was used for chromatography. For S9 studies, Cpd21 (2
mmol/L) was incubated in a 1 mL incubation volume with 1
mg of murine CD-1 S9 (combined cytosol and microsome)
fractions (Celsis/In Vitro Technologies) and phase I (the
NADPH regenerating system) cofactors (Sigma) for 0 to 240
minutes. Reactions were quenched by mixing the incubation mixture with 1 mL of methanol/0.2 ng/mL n-benzylbenzamide/0.2% formic acid. The quenched mixture was
vortexed for 15 seconds, incubated at room temperature for
10 minutes, and spun for 5 minutes at 986  g. Supernatants were spun in a refrigerated microcentrifuge for 5
minutes at 16,100  g. The second supernatant was transferred to an HPLC vial and analyzed by LC/MS-MS.
Pharmacokinetic studies
Six- to 7-week-old NCR-nu/nu female mice were implanted
with 2.5  105 MPNST cells in the left ﬂank, subcutaneously.
When tumors reached 800 mm3, animals were injected with
Cpd21 at 20 mg/kg in 0.2 mL 10% ethanol, 10% PEG400, 80% of a
solution of 5% dextrose, pH 7.4. Blood was drawn at 0, 10, 30, 60,
180, 360, and 1,440 minutes using the anticoagulant, ACD
(acidiﬁed citrate dextrose) and plasma isolated by centrifugation. One hundred microliters of plasma was mixed with 200 mL
acetonitrile containing 0.15% formic acid and 37.5 ng/mL nbenzylbenzamide IS. Samples were vortexed 15 seconds, incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, and spun twice at
16,100  g at 4 C. Amount of Cpd21 present in plasma was
quantiﬁed by LC/MS-MS to determine the rate of clearance
from mouse blood. A Cpd21 standard curve was generated
using blank plasma spiked with known Cpd21 concentrations
and processed as described above. Concentrations of Cpd21in
each time-point sample were quantiﬁed using Analyst 1.4.2.
The limit of detection was deﬁned as 3-fold above the signal
obtained from blank plasma. The limit of quantitation (LOQ)
was deﬁned as the lowest concentration at which back calculation yielded a concentration within 20% of theoretical. The
LOQ for plasma was 5 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL for tumor. Back
calculation of points on the standard curve yielded values
within 15% of theoretical over 4 orders of magnitude (5,000 to 5
or 1 ng/mL). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
using the noncompartmental analysis tool of WinNonLin
(Pharsight).
Bioluminescent imaging
sMPNST-lucþ cells (2  505 cells/200 mL) were injected in
both ﬂanks of nude mice. Mice were injected with 40 mg/kg
Cpd21 or vehicle (10% ethanol, 10% PEG400, and 80% of 5%
dextrose in water) intraperitoneally twice per day for 4 weeks.
Mice were injected with 160 mL 20 mg/mL D-Luciferin Potassium Salt (Perkin Elmer) in 0.9% sterile NaCl, and total ﬂux
was quantiﬁed using IVIS Lumina II (Caliper Life Sciences)
weekly.

(Novus Biologicals).

Results
Nf1 and p53-deﬁcient SKPs form MPNST
NF1-associated dermal and plexiform neuroﬁbromas are
histologically compatible despite having signiﬁcantly different
natural history and tumor progression properties. Recently, we
reported that SKPs are the cell-of-origin of dermal neuroﬁbromas (4). Given the potential in mice for neural crest progenitors
to give rise to MPNST after additional loss of the p53 tumor
suppressor, we tested the consequences of dual Nf1 and p53 loss

of function (NP) in SKPs. SKPs from mice with Nf1f/f;p53f/f
genotype were cultured and infected with adenovirus containing Cre-GFP (Ad-Cre) to induce tumor suppressor recombination (Fig. 1A, a; ref. 30). The majority of infected cells displayed
green ﬂuorescence, indicating effective viral entry and expression (Fig. 1A, b). We conﬁrmed effective Cre-mediated recombination of all ﬂoxed alleles by PCR analysis (Fig. 1Ab).
The Nf1/;p53/ cells (NP SKPs) were reimplanted into
the same mouse from which they were derived (autograft) and
highly aggressive, malignant tumors developed in all cases (Fig.
1A, c). These tumors could be successfully cultured as either
spheres or adherent cells (data not shown) or allografted into
nude mice (Fig. 1A, d). These tumors (termed sMPNST, for SKPderived MPNST) were assayed for human MPNST-associated
genes, including embryonic Schwann cell markers, S100 (24,
25), Krox20 (6), PLP (31), and GAP43 (32, 33); developing glia
marker, Dhh (34); and neural-crest-associated marker, snail

data demonstrated expression of all markers in all sMPNSTs
analyzed (Fig. 1Ae). Thus, sMPNSTs exhibit molecular characteristics of human NF1 associated MPNST.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of sMPNSTs
showed presence of spindle-shaped cells that interweave in
a poorly differentiated, wavy appearance, reminiscent of
human MPNST histology (Fig. 1B, a). In addition, the commonly used MPNST markers, S100 and GAP43, were present
(Fig. 1B—, b–e). Therefore, our results indicate that SKPs, cells
that give rise to neuroﬁbromas upon loss of Nf1, can also give
rise to MPNST with additional loss of p53. The facility of
generating and explanting sMPNSTs made this a favorable
system for performing chemical compound screens.
Novel MPNST inhibitory small molecule
We hold the concern that over time in culture, tumor cells
will drift from their original intrinsic cellular and molecular
programs in unpredictable ways. These uncontrollable and
unmeasurable changes may inadvertently alter fundamental
properties of the original tumor cells. To mitigate these concerns, the relative facility of generating primary cultures from
sMPNSTs afforded the advantage of propagating sufﬁcient
numbers of cells for a high-throughput screening while keeping
the cell passage number low. We performed a limited highthroughput, small-molecule screen using sMPNST cells produced above in an extension of a related ongoing large-scale
screen in our research group. We carried out a 200,000 compound screen on primary mouse glioblastoma multiforme cells

590

Cancer Res; 74(2) January 15, 2014

that are deﬁcient for Nf1, p53, and Pten (S. Kyun Lim and Luis F.
Parada, unpublished data). This original glioblastoma multiforme screen yielded 4,480 compounds, identiﬁed as inhibitory
to glioblastoma multiforme cell growth. We reasoned that
since sMPNST cells are deﬁcient in two of these same tumor
suppressors, some compounds might have conserved sMPNST
cell growth inhibitory properties.
A well-established luminescence assay for measuring ATP
levels (an indication of cellular metabolic activity) was adopted
(CellTiter-Glo, Promega), and performed 96 hours after compound exposure. A total of 1,515 compounds exhibited more
than 20% decrease in ATP levels at 2.5 mmol/L (Fig. 2A and B).
To exclude compounds that exert general cell toxicity, or
perturb the generic cell cycle or mitotic machinery, we counter-screened the 1,515 compounds against Myc-immortalized
Schwann cells (27, 36) and eliminated compounds that showed
more than 20% lower ATP levels. The resultant 119 compounds
were rescreened on sMPNSTs with a cutoff at 70% inhibition.
Twenty-eight compounds passed this test and were further
tested in dose response studies ranging from 125 nmol/L to 20
mmol/L. The twenty-ﬁrst compound (Fig. 2C; Cpd21 or
SW106065) inhibited ATP consumption of sMPNST and all
other models of MPNST tested (Fig. 2D) with an EC50 of 1
mmol/L. We extended the functional analysis of Cpd21 to
additional cell lines. Human MPNST cell lines, S462 (Fig. 2E)
and SNF96.2 (Fig. 2F), were assayed for dose-dependent growth,
and EC50 concentrations of 439.0 and 753.6 nmol/L, respectively, were determined. In contrast, NIH3T3 cells and wild-type

control. Total caspase-3 (T. casp.-3) and cleaved caspase-3 (Cl. casp.-3) were assayed in each case. All values, mean  SD. The Student t test used for
signiﬁcance testing ( , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001).

Schwann cells showed a considerably higher dose resistance
(Fig. 2G). We also tested sMPNST response to Cpd21 in anchorage-independent soft agar growth assays and found that Cpd21
inhibited colony formation (Fig. 2H and I). This effect was also
observed in MPNST cells derived from- cis-Nf1þ/;p53þ/ mice
(Fig. 2J and K). Thus, Cpd21 has general toxic activity on Nf1 and
p53-deﬁcient MPNST cells but not on diverse nontumorigenic,
mitotically active ﬁbroblasts or Schwann cells.
Cpd21 delays the cell cycle in sMPNST
To address the mechanism of action of Cpd21, we treated
sMPNST cells at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mmol/L for 24 hours, and
pulsed with BrdUrd for 30 minutes. Subsequent ﬂow cytometry
analysis revealed a decreased percentage of cells in S-phase,
and a corresponding increased percentage in G1–G0 and G2–M,
compared with treatment with DMSO alone (Fig. 3A).
Several cell-cycle regulatory genes exhibited decreased
mRNA in the presence of Cpd21, including cyclin A2, cyclin
B1, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk4, and cdk6 (Fig. 3B and C). Increased
levels of cdkn1a and cdkn2a mRNA were observed in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3D). Also, levels of cyclin D1 protein,

www.aacrjournals.org

which is known to interact with cdk4/6 in regulating G1–S
progression, were decreased (Fig. 3E; refs. 37, 38). These results
indicate that following Cpd21 exposure, cells in S-phase are
underrepresented, consistent with cell-cycle delay and an
arrest of the mitotic machinery.
We examined Cpd21-treated sMPNST cells for apoptosis by
Annexin V-FITC–conjugated ﬂow cytometry. Tumor cells
treated with Cpd21 concentrations at or above 0.5 mmol/L
showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of
apoptotic cells (Fig. 4A). At the EC50 concentration of 1 mmol/L,
11.23  1.56% of the cells were Annexin V-positive, compared
with 5.02%  0.83% in DMSO-treated control cells.
We also performed Western blotting of Cpd21-treated
sMPNST cells and observed caspase-3 (Fig. 4B) and PARP (Fig.
4C) cleavage, consistent with induced apoptosis. We further
validated this mechanism in MPNST cells cultured from spontaneous MPNSTs from our cis-Nf1þ/;p53þ/ mouse model
(Fig. 4D), and in the human MPNST cell line, S462 (Fig. 4E).
Other cell types, including Myc-immortalized Schwann cells
(Fig. 4F) and MEF cells (Fig. 4G), did not undergo caspase-3
cleavage. Together, these data indicate that, in vitro, Cpd21

induced mitotic arrest of MPNST cells that ultimately results in
cellular apoptosis, and that this phenotype was not observed in
untransformed dividing cells.
Cpd21 decreases tumor burden and induces apoptosis
in vivo
To determine whether Cpd21 could be directly tested in vivo,
we sought to deﬁne the metabolic properties in vitro according
to previously published methods (39, 40). To examine stability,
Cpd21 was incubated with puriﬁed, hepatic, enzymatic S9
fraction over a period of 240 minutes, and measured over time
(Fig. 5A). The half-life in the S9 fraction is 22.65 minutes. We also
incubated Cpd21 with cultured hepatocytes and found that the
half-life is 121.6 minutes (Fig. 5B). These assays demonstrate
that Cpd21 would have reasonable stability in vivo.
We next sought to deﬁne the pharmacokinetic properties
of Cpd21 according to previously published methods (40).
sMPNST (2.5  105) cells were injected subcutaneously into
nude mice, and when tumors reached 800 mm3, a single dose of
Cpd21 was injected intraperitoneally at 20 mg/kg. Plasma and
tumor samples were collected after 10, 30, 90, 180, 360, and 960
minutes and assayed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 5C). We
observed that Cpd21 rapidly distributes from the plasma into
sMPNST tissues and that the half-life in sMPNST tissues is 6 to
8 hours once the compound is completely distributed. Importantly, Cpd21 concentration remains above the EC50 concentration of 1 mmol/L (204 ng/mL) in the sMPNSTs for more than
6 hours. These results indicate that Cpd21 is successfully
delivered to the tumor tissue in adequate concentrations and
with an adequate half-life for in vivo studies.
We next determined a dose tolerable for chronic in vivo
administration of Cpd21. Cpd21 dissolved in a mixture of
ethanol, PEG400, and dextrose was delivered intraperitoneally
at 20 or 40 mg/kg twice per day, into nude mice over the course
of 2 weeks for comparison with vehicle administration. These
concentrations were selected because 40 mg/kg is the maximum solubility in the aforementioned formulation. Over this
period, the mice were weighed daily and observed for signs of
toxicity. Neither concentration of Cpd21 produced measurable
weight loss or distress in the mice (data not shown). Therefore,
we selected 40 mg/kg twice per day intraperitoneally as the
dosing regimen for efﬁcacy studies.
We then tested the effects of Cpd21 administration on tumor
burden in vivo. Nude mice were injected with sMPNST cells
carrying a luciferase gene (MPNST-lucþ) to permit noninvasive in vivo tumor growth assessment by luminescence. One
week after allograft, recipient mice were intraperitoneally
injected with either 40 mg/kg of Cpd21 or vehicle twice daily
over 4 weeks, and mice were imaged weekly. We observed that

treatment with Cpd21 reduced the tumor burden as measured
by total ﬂux normalized to baseline ﬂux levels (Fig. 5D and E).
BrdUrd was injected into mice before necropsy. Both BrdUrd
and Ki67 evaluation indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor
cell proliferation following Cpd21 treatment (Fig. 5F–I). These
results are consistent with our observations that Cpd21 inhibits the cell cycle in vitro, resulting in a decrease in the
proliferative capacity of sMPNSTs.
Consistent with in vitro data, Cpd21-treated sMPNSTs
exhibited elevated activated caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 5J–
M). These results were conﬁrmed by Western blotting to detect
cleaved caspase-3 and PARP in tumors from our in vivo model
(Fig. 5N). Taken together, our results demonstrate that Cpd21
can be delivered to mice in concentrations to sufﬁciently
penetrate sMPNST tissue, and inhibit tumor development.
To extend the previous observation that chronic Cpd21
exposure did not appear to cause general toxicity, we examined
various tissues following necropsy for histologic evidence of
Cpd21-induced toxicity. In addition to tumor tissue (Fig. 6A),
we examined liver (Fig. 6B), kidney (Fig. 6C), brain (Fig. 6D),
skin (Fig. 6E), and sciatic nerve (Fig. 6F), and found no evidence
of abnormal histology. Activated caspase-3 could only be
detected in tumor samples (Fig. 6G) and not in other tissues
examined (Fig. 6H–L). In contrast to other chemotherapeutic
agents such as doxorubicin that induce toxicity in a variety of
tissues (41), Cpd21 appears to act most notably on malignant
tumor tissue.
Interaction with other anticancer agents
In addition to doxorubicin, MPNSTs have been shown to be
sensitive to pathway-speciﬁc inhibitors of MAPK/ERK (42),
PI3K/AKT (43), mTOR (43–45), and CXCR4 (7). We therefore
examined whether Cpd21 in conjunction with doxorubicin or
speciﬁc inhibitors, including U0126, a MEK inhibitor (42);
LY294002, an AKT inhibitor (43); rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor (43–45); and AMD3100, a CXCR4 inhibitor (7), might better
inhibit sMPNST cell growth as assessed by ATP consumption
(46). We found the inhibition of the PI3K pathway combined
with Cpd21 treatment resulted in a decrease in cellular growth
and survival that is greater than either inhibitor alone (Fig. 7A
and B). Phospho-AKT Western blots of sMPNST cells treated
with LY294002 at 20 mmol/L for 30 or 60 minutes veriﬁed
effective pAKT inhibition in sMPNST cells (Fig. 7C). Inhibition
of the MEK/ERK pathway combined with Cpd21 treatment did
not produce detectable additive or synergistic effects (Fig. 7D).
Phospho-ERK inhibition by U0126 was veriﬁed by Western
blotting (Fig. 7E). Inhibition of the mTOR pathway combined
with Cpd21 treatment did not produce detectable additive or
synergistic effects (Fig. 7F). In fact, sMPNST cellular growth

seemed relatively resistant to rapamycin, despite exhibiting
decreased pS6 levels after rapamycin treatment (Fig. 7G). None
of the other tested reagents produced measurable additive or
synergistic effects (data not shown). We extended the above
studies of dual LY294002 and Cpd21 treatment to MPNST cells
derived from cis-Nf1þ/;p53þ/ mice, and again, the combined
effect of both inhibitors is greater than that of each individual
inhibitor (Fig. 7H). We tested the effects of both inhibitors on
phosphorylation of AKT and found that pAKT was inhibited
only when LY294002 is present (Fig. 7C and I). Thus, in contrast
to published reports of successful application of MEK inhibitors to suppress NF1-based solid tumors and leukemias, in the
context of Cp21, coinhibition of the PI3K pathway was most
effective in impeding tumor cell growth and survival.

Discussion
Malignant peripheral nerve tumors are the major source of
mortality in NF1. Like most malignant sarcomas, these tumors
are resistant to all current chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic strategies. It has long been recognized that MPNSTs

594

Cancer Res; 74(2) January 15, 2014

harbor tumor suppressor mutations in addition to Nf1 loss.
Notably, loss-of-function mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor have been reported (16–18). This has led to the successful
generation of spontaneous mouse models of MPNST by mutation of both Nf1 and p53 tumor suppressor genes (24, 25). A
further reﬁnement of MPNST modeling came about by identifying SKPs as a source for dermal neuroﬁbromas in the skin
and by the capacity of SKPs to engender plexiform neuroﬁbromas when placed in the sciatic nerve (4). Additive mutation
of p53 together with Nf1 turned SKPs into progenitors of
MPNST, thus facilitating high-throughput screens for chemical
compounds that might inhibit early passage cell growth.
We identiﬁed Cpd21 as a small molecule with inhibitory
properties on cultured mouse and human MPNST cells. It was a
surprise that this compound originating from a 200,000 chemical compound library, had, without chemical modiﬁcation,
a repertoire of desirable in vivo properties, including low
micromolar EC50, adequate stability, manageable toxicity, and
adequate accumulation in solid tumor tissue. These serendipitous favorable properties allowed allograft analysis of

antitumor efﬁcacy and demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in
tumor burden by this compound. Future efforts to assess the
effectiveness of Cp21 on human MPNST xenografts will provide additional insight into the potential for this compound as
a therapeutic agent.
At present we cannot identify the speciﬁc mechanism
whereby Cpd21 exerts its inhibitory action on MPNST cells.
Compound exposure to tumor cells results in a cell-cycle delay
manifested by depletion of certain cell-cycle–related molecules
and eventually leading to cellular apoptosis. A similar course of
events is seen when tumor-bearing mice are treated with

compound. However, the precise molecular target and mechanistic mode of compound action remains a topic of investigation. Empirical chemical compound screens to identify
cancer cell inhibitory compounds have been applied for several
decades. A signiﬁcant proportion of such empirically derived
cancer cell inhibitory small molecules that have reached the
clinic have turned out to mechanistically impinge on various
aspects of cell division, including mitotic spindle machinery,
cell-cycle machinery, and DNA replication and repair machinery. These cellular properties are not unique to cancer cells and
are shared by many normally dividing cells in the body that are

essential for organ health. Chemotherapeutic toxicity to normal cells represents a major impediment to effective cancer
treatment. In this regard, our screen departs from traditional
high-throughput screens in that we limited our cells assayed to
early passage cells rather than to established cell lines. It is also
noteworthy that the cellular speciﬁcity of Cpd21 renders it
relatively innocuous to the normally dividing cells we tested
(MEFs, Myc-Schwann Cells, and wild-type SKPs). This feature
is consistent with the idea that the compound target(s) relates
to the "cancer state" of the MPNST cells rather than to more
general properties of mitotically active cells. Although we
currently do not know whether Cpd21 is also effective against
the benign plexiform neuroﬁbromas, it is entirely possible that
these slowly dividing tumor cells may also be susceptible to
Cpd21 activity if they share common pathways with MPNSTs
that are potential target(s) of Cpd21.
Recent advances in MPNST research have pointed to additional potential therapeutic targets, including the CXCR4 cytokine axis (7), the mTOR pathways (44), and the RAS/MEK/ERK
pathways (13, 47–50). In these studies, AMD3100 and rapamycin
have been shown to inhibit MPNSTs from the cis-Nf1þ/;p53þ/
-mouse model, and ERK inhibitors, such as U0126, have been
veriﬁed in a variety of human and mouse derived MPNSTs.
Interestingly, when such compounds were tested in conjunction
with Cp21, we found no additive value. Instead, blockade of the
PI3K pathway did cooperate with Cpd21 action to inhibit tumor
growth. This intriguing result points to the potential plasticity of
cancer cells and to the complexity of tumor pathway interactions. For example, it may be that Cpd21 activity somehow
unveils a synthetic dependence on PI3K signaling that is not
present in the absence of compound. Continued studies of
Cpd21, its speciﬁc mode of action, and the mechanistic basis
for its activity on MPNST cells but not on nontumorigenic cells
may shed light on novel anticancer pathways.
