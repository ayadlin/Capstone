Abstract
Increased levels of EZH2, a critical regulator of cellular memory, signal the presence of metastasis and poor
outcome in breast cancer patients. High levels of EZH2 are associated with nuclear pleomorphism, lack of
estrogen receptor expression, and decreased nuclear levels of BRCA1 tumor suppressor protein in invasive
breast carcinomas. The mechanism by which EZH2 overexpression promotes the growth of poorly differentiated
invasive carcinomas remains to be defined. Here, we show that EZH2 controls the intracellular localization of
BRCA1 protein. Conditional doxycycline-induced upregulation of EZH2 in benign mammary epithelial cells
results in nuclear export of BRCA1 protein, aberrant mitoses with extra centrosomes, and genomic instability.
EZH2 inhibition in CAL51 breast cancer cells induces BRCA1 nuclear localization and rescues defects in ploidy
and mitosis. Mechanistically, EZH2 overexpression is sufficient for activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/
Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway specifically through activation of Akt isoform 1. EZH2-induced BRCA1 nuclear export,
aneuploidy, and mitotic defects were prevented by treatment with the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin.
Targeted inhibition of Akt-1, Akt-2, and Akt-3 isoforms revealed that the EZH2-induced phenotype requires
specific activation of Akt-1. The relevance of our studies to human breast cancer is highlighted by the finding that
high EZH2 protein levels are associated with upregulated expression of phospho-Akt-1 (Ser473) and decreased
nuclear expression of phospho-BRCA1 (Ser1423) in 39% of invasive breast carcinomas. These results enable us to
pinpoint one mechanism by which EZH2 regulates BRCA1 expression and genomic stability mediated by the
PI3K/Akt-1 pathway. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2360–70. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
EZH2 is a Polycomb group protein involved in the regulation of cellular memory with roles in tumorigenesis including
cancer cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, and neoplastic cell transformation (1–7). In breast
cancer, EZH2 protein is elevated in aggressive and metastatic
tumors and is an independent predictor of survival (8).
Immunohistochemical studies of human breast tissue samples have shown that while EZH2 expression is low in normal
epithelium, EZH2 is overexpressed in 54% of invasive carcinomas, especially in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors
with low BRCA1 nuclear expression (8–11).

The tumor suppressor BRCA1 regulates DNA repair and
activation of cell-cycle checkpoints and has a central role in
the maintenance of chromosomal stability (12). Heterozygous
germ line mutations in the BRCA1 gene predispose women to
breast and ovarian cancer, with a lifetime risk of breast cancer
of up to 80% (13). Although somatic mutations of BRCA1 are
not common, expression of its messenger RNA and protein is
reduced in approximately 40% of sporadic (nonhereditary)
breast carcinomas (14–16). Independent of the mechanism
underlying the decrease in nuclear BRCA1 protein, the vast
majority of breast carcinomas with reduced nuclear BRCA1
are poorly differentiated, aneuploid, and lack expression of ER
(16–18).
BRCA1 protein exerts its tumor suppressor functions in the
nucleus and can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (19). Recent studies have provided information on the
subcellular localization of BRCA1 protein during the cell cycle
in normal and cancerous breast cells (20–22). BRCA1 protein
is exported from the nucleus transiently during the initial part
of S phase. By late S phase, BRCA1 resumes being a predominantly nuclear protein (20–22). Activation of the protein
kinase B (Akt) has been implicated in the nuclear/cytoplasmic
shuttling of BRCA1 protein in breast cells (23–26).
EZH2 has been proposed to participate in cell growth and
invasion in breast cancer and has been studied to modulate
BRCA1-mediated proliferation (8, 11, 27). However, no studies

EZH2 Regulates BRCA1 and Genomic Stability

have been carried out to investigate the mechanism by which
EZH2 influences BRCA1 protein and the link between EZH2
and genomic stability in breast cancer. Here, we show that
EZH2 regulates the intracellular localization of BRCA1 protein
in benign and malignant breast cells. Conditional doxycycline
(Dox)-induced EZH2 overexpression in MCF10A cells leads to
nuclear export of BRCA1 protein and is sufficient to trigger
aberrant mitoses and numerical chromosomal alterations.
EZH2 inhibition in ER-negative CAL51 breast cancer cells
induces BRCA1 nuclear localization and rescues their ploidy
and mitotic defects. Mechanistically, our data show that
EZH2-induced BRCA1 nuclear export, mitotic, and ploidy
abnormalities require activation of the phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt-1 signaling pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and breast tissues
CAL51 breast cancer cell line was purchased from
German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Cultures
(DSMZ GmbH; Cat. No. DSMZ ACC 302) and grown under
recommended conditions. Immortalized human mammary
epithelial cells MCF10A were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection and grown under recommended
conditions.
Lentiviral transductions
To conditionally overexpress EZH2 in MCF10A cells, a Doxinducible system was employed. EZH2 gene was isolated form
pCDNA3-myc EZH2 plasmid (gift of Dr. Chinnaiyan) and
cloned into the pLVX-Tight-Puro on the Lenti-X Tet-On
advance inducible expression system (Clontech). Briefly, the
Lenti-X Tet-On system is based on cells that express the E. coli
Tet repressor protein (TetR), which negatively regulates the
tetracycline operon on the Tn 10 transposon (vector: pLVXTet-On) together with the tetO (tet operator sequences; vector:
pLVX-Tight-Puro). In the presence of tetracycline or Dox, TetR
dissociates from tetO, and transcription of the resistancemediating genes begins. Lentivirus-bearing EZH2 conditional
system and vector control were used to transduce MCF10A
cells. Cells were cultured in complete media supplemented
with puromycin (10 mg/mL). EZH2 expression was transiently
induced with Dox (500 ng/mL) by following the manufacturer's instructions.
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting human EZH2
(NM_152998 NCBI; V2LHS_17507; Open Biosystems; Cat.
No. RHS4430-99139126) was cloned into a pLKO.1-Puro vector. The shRNA-containing plasmid was packaged into lentiviral particles at the Vector Core (University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, MI). Background control was Lenti-PuroEMPTY-VSVG.
To generate stable CAL51 breast cancer cells with EZH2
knockdown, 1  106 cells per 100-mm plate were transduced
with the corresponding lentivirus-containing supernatant
diluted 1:1 with fresh serum-free medium for 48 hours. Stable
clones were selected for antibiotic resistance with 10 mg/mL
puromycin (Sigma) at 37 C under 10% CO2 for 3 weeks (11).

50 -GAAAGAUUGUGUACCGUGA-30 ; antisense, 50 -UCACGGUACACAAUCUUUC-30 ), and human siRNA negative control
oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma (28). Cells were
split into complete medium for 24 hours before subconfluence.
siRNA oligos were transfected into subconfluent cells with
Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blot analysis
Nuclear enriched fractions were separated by utilizing the
NE-Per kit (Pierce). Western blot analyses were carried out
with 100 mg of whole cell extract, nuclear, or cytoplasmic
enriched fractions as indicated in the corresponding figure.
Samples were boiled in 1  SDS loading buffer, separated by
SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose (NC)
membrane. NC membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry
milk and were incubated with corresponding primary antibodies at 4 C overnight. Immunoblot signals were visualized
by a chemiluminescence system as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Bioscience). Blots were reprobed with
a-tubulin or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) to confirm the equal loading of samples and with
laminin B1 to confirm the nuclear enrichment of the fractionated samples.
Primary antibodies, including anti-EZH2 and anti-phopshoPolo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) Thr210 (BD Biosciences), anti-BRCA1
(EMD Chemicals), anti-phospho-BRCA1 (p-BRCA1; Ser1423),
anti-laminin B1 (Abcam), anti-Akt, anti-Akt-1, anti-phosphoAkt (anti-p-Akt; Ser473), anti-Akt-3, anti-p-Akt-3 (Ser472),
anti-Aurora A, anti-Aurora B, anti-phosho-Aurora A (anti-pAurora A; Thr288; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p-Akt-1
(Ser473) (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Akt-2, anti-p-Akt-2
(Ser474), and anti-Plk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), antib-actin, anti-a-tubulin (Sigma), anti-p-Aurora B (Thr232; Biolegend), were used at the manufacturers’ recommended dilutions. The PI3K/Akt inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin
(Invitrogen) were employed to investigate the contribution
of the PI3K/Akt pathway on EZH2 function by following
previous procedures (29).
Analysis of mitosis and mitotic index
Cells were grown in slides, fixed with paraformaldehyde,
rotated for 45 minutes at room temperature, and incubated
with anti-phospho-histone H3 (anti-p-H3) antibody (Ser10
mitotic maker)-FITC–conjugated (Millipore). The mitotic
index is the percentage of cells staining for p-H3. The presence
of abnormal mitosis was studied by immunofluorescence with
antibodies against p-H3 (Ser10), a-tubulin, and Aurora A. 40 ,6Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) identified the nuclei. Slides
were visualized by a confocal microscope. The number of cells
with abnormal mitosis and greater than 2 Aurora A foci was
recorded. A total of 300 cells were counted in triplicate. Details
on cell synchronization, nocodazole treatment, Aurora
A activity assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence,
and human tissue samples are found in the Supplementary
Methods.

Metaphase analysis
MCF10A cells were grown to 70% confluency and treated
with Dox (500 ng/mL) for 24 hours at 3 and 5 days. Untreated
cells served as controls. Cells were treated with 50 ng/mL
colcemid (Invitrogen) for 24 hours and then collected and
resuspended in a hypotonic solution of 2% KCl and 2%
Na3C6H5O7 for 7 minutes at 37 C. Metaphase spreads were
prepared and stained with Giemsa as described (30). Slides
were examined with an ImagingZ1 microscope (Carl Zeiss)
equipped with the ISIS image processing software (MetaSystems). One hundred metaphases were counted in triplicate for each sample. Tetraploidy was defined as
chromosome numbers of 81 to 100 by following established
criteria (31–33).

Results
EZH2 regulates the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of
BRCA1 in benign and breast cancer cells
To determine the oncogenic phenotype of EZH2 overexpression in nontumorigenic human breast epithelial
cells, we generated a Dox-regulated system to overexpress
EZH2 in MCF10A cells. The empty vector served as negative
control (pLVX). EZH2 was detected in whole cell lysates of
Dox-induced MCF10A cells transduced with EZH2-containing plasmid (pLVX-EZH2) but not in the lysates of cells
transduced with the empty vector (pLVX; Fig. 1A, top).
We also generated CAL51 breast cancer cells with stable
downregulation of EZH2 by using previously validated
shRNAs (11). CAL51 breast cancer cells were chosen for
EZH2 downregulation because they overexpress EZH2,
are human cells, ER negative, and lack BRCA1 mutations
(11, 34).
Western blot analyses showed that Dox treatment of
MCF10A-pLVX-EZH2 cells decreased nuclear BRCA1 protein
and increased BRCA1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, middle and
bottom). To investigate the effect of EZH2 on the kinetics of
BRCA1 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm during
the cell cycle, MCF10A-pLVX-EZH2 cells with or without Dox
treatment were synchronized at G1/S by using double thymidine block and released and analyzed at the specified time
points of early S phase. By immunofluorescence, BRCA1
localized to the nucleus of untreated MCF10A-pLVX-EZH2
cells. In contrast, Dox-induced EZH2 upregulation led to
cytoplasmic localization of BRCA1 (Fig. 1B). Fluorescence
signals of individual cells in the nucleus and cytoplasm were
quantified using the ImageJ NIH software (Fig. 1B). On confirming the specificity of these results, no effect on BRCA1
intracellular localization was observed when MCF10A-pLVX
cells (empty vector) were treated with Dox (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
EZH2 KD on CAL51 breast cancer cells increased BRCA1
protein in the nuclear enriched fraction immediately after
release from cell-cycle block at G1/S (Fig. 1C). While CAL51
controls exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic and perinuclear BRCA1 protein as previously reported (20), EZH2 KD cells
accumulated BRCA1 in the nucleus (Fig. 1C and D). We
conclude that EZH2 influences the intracellular localization

2362

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

of BRCA1 protein in nontumorigenic breast cells and breast
cancer cells.
Overexpression of EZH2 protein induces extra
centrosomes and abnormal mitosis
Immunofluorescence studies showed that Dox-induced
EZH2 overexpression led to mitotic defects, including multiple
mitotic spindles which contrasted with the absence of mitotic
defects in untreated controls (Fig. 2A, left). To determine the
effect of EZH2 overexpression on centrosome number, we
detected Aurora A by immunofluorescence. Early in mitosis,
Aurora A localizes to the centrosomes to mediate their
maturation, separation, and spindle formation (35). As
expected, Aurora A localized to the centrosomes during
metaphase of untreated MCF10A-pLVX-EZH2 cells as evidenced by the 2 distinct foci that colocalized to the spindle
poles (Fig. 2A, right). Dox-induced EZH2 overexpression led to
a 6-fold increase in the percentage of mitotic cells with more
than 2 Aurora A foci (Fig. 2A, right).
Because CAL51 cells contain a tetraploid population with
centrosome amplification and multiple mitotic spindles, they
constitute a good model to test the effect of EZH2 KD on
centrosome number, mitotic spindle, and mitotic defects (34).
EZH2 KD on CAL51 cancer cells significantly reduced the
number of aberrant mitosis and the number of cells with more
than 2 Aurora A foci (Fig. 2B).
We found that EZH2 expression in MCF10A and CAL51 cells
regulates the levels and activity of Aurora A and B kinases,
essential for mitotic entry and progression. Corresponding
with the increase in Aurora A and B proteins observed in
asynchronized cultures (Fig. 2C, left), EZH2 overexpression
increased their enzymatic activity in nocodazole-treated samples. EZH2 overexpression induced phosphorylation of Aurora
A on Thr288, Aurora B on Thr232, Aurora A interacting protein
Plk1 on Thr210, and Aurora kinase substrate p-H3 Ser10, as
well as Aurora A in vitro kinase activity (Fig. 2C, right;
Supplementary Fig. S2A; ref. 36). EZH2 KD in CAL51 cells
had the opposite effect (Fig. 2D). Further strengthening these
data, EZH2 protein regulated Aurora A and B protein levels
during cell-cycle progression and their messenger RNA levels
(Supplementary Fig. S2C–D). Collectively, these data implicate
EZH2 in mitosis and show a novel regulatory role for EZH2 on
expression and activity of Aurora A and B kinases and on
centrosome number in benign and breast cancer cells.
EZH2 regulates genomic stability
Errors in mitosis can lead to genomic instability. In contrast
to the diploid chromosome number of untreated MCF10A
cells, EZH2 overexpression resulted in 16.8% and 26.8% polyploidy (51 chromosomes) after 72 and 120 hours of Dox
treatment, respectively. Chromosome counting indicated that
57% of cells within the polyploid population were near-tetraploid (51–100 chromosomes) at 5 days of Dox treatment
(Fig. 3A; refs. 31–33). In contrast, EZH2 KD decreased the
percentage of tetraploid CAL51 cells from 23.2% to 9.2%
(Fig. 3B). These data reveal that besides its ability to regulate
the number of centrosomes, EZH2 plays a role in the maintenance of genomic stability.

investigated the effect of EZH2 on the expression and phosphorylation of Akt isoforms 1, 2, and 3 in benign and breast
cancer cells. EZH2 overexpression in MCF10A cells increased
Akt-1 protein but did not influence Akt-2 or Akt-3 expression
or phosphorylation, compared with controls (Fig. 4A, left).
Consistently, CAL51/EZH2 KD cells exhibited decreased Akt-1
phosphorylation at Ser473 compared with scrambled controls
(Fig. 4A, right). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation showed
that EZH2 could directly interact with Akt-1 in MCF10A cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). These data led us to hypothesize that
Akt-1 may mediate the observed EZH2-induced phenotype.
We next investigated the specific contribution of each Akt
isoform to EZH2-induced functions by independent siRNA
knockdown of Akt-1, Akt-2, and Akt-3 followed by Dox treatment to induce EZH2 overexpression (Fig. 4B). Specific inhibition of Akt-1 decreased EZH2-induced BRCA1 nuclear export.
In contrast, knockdown of Akt-2 or Akt-3 had no effect
(Fig. 4C). Akt-1 was required for EZH2-induced genomic
instability and abnormal mitosis. siRNA inhibition of Akt-1
completely prevented EZH2-induced polyploidy and mitotic
defects (Fig. 5A and B). Akt-2 and Akt-3 proteins were dispensable for EZH2-induced polyploidy (Fig. 5A). Similarly,
Akt-3 expression was not required for EZH2 effect on abnor-

mal mitosis (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, Akt-2 KD blunted mitosis
in MCF10A cells independent of EZH2 expression (mitotic
index for siRNA control/no Dox ¼ 18.3% and for siRNA
control/Dox ¼ 27%; compared with mitotic index for Akt-2
siRNA/no Dox ¼ 5.6% and for Akt-2 siRNA/Dox ¼ 5%).
Further supporting the role of Akt pathway on BRCA1 localization and genomic instability, pharmacologic inhibition of
PI3K/Akt, using LY294002 or wortmannin, prevented the
EZH2-induced phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S5; Supplementary Table S1). Altogether, these results directly show
that activation of PI3K/Akt-1 pathway is essential for
EZH2-induced BRCA1 nuclear export, aneuploidy, and mitotic
defects in benign breast cells.
EZH2 overexpression is associated with increased Akt-1
phosphorylation and decreased phospho-BRCA1

and exhibit BRCA1 downregulation (8–11). We discovered
that EZH2 regulates the intracellular distribution of BRCA1
protein in benign breast cells and ER-negative breast cancer
cells. To draw these conclusions, we investigated the effect of
EZH2 on the intracellular localization of BRCA1 protein by
utilizing independent and complementary gain- and loss-offunction approaches. By measuring the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of BRCA1 protein at different time points after
release from G1/S cell-cycle block, it was concluded that EZH2

overexpression in MCF10A induced nuclear export with cytoplasmic retention of BRCA1 protein. Consistent with this
observation, while BRCA1 was mainly localized to the cytoplasm of CAL51 breast cancer cells, it was translocated to the
nucleus upon lentiviral-mediated EZH2 KD.
The mechanisms governing the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of BRCA1 protein are not fully elucidated, but recent
studies implicate the membrane serine/threonine protein
kinase B/Akt (23–26). A tumorigenic mechanism of Akt upon
its phosphorylation is the induction of cytoplasmic localization of tumor suppressor proteins including p21 Cip1/WAF1
and FOXO3a (37, 38). The functional relationship between Akt
and BRCA1 is complex and contextual (23). The PI3K/Akt
pathway promoted nuclear translocation of BRCA1, and reciprocally, BRCA1 deficiency could activate the PI3K/Akt signaling (26, 39). Akt-1 activation was shown to induce
cytoplasmic retention of BRCA1 protein in breast cancer cells
(24). By using pharmacologic pathway inhibition and transient, specific siRNA interference of Akt isoforms, we provide
direct evidence that the effect of EZH2 on BRCA1 intracellular
localization necessitates the activation of Akt-1, whereas Akt-2
and Akt-3 are dispensable for this function. Immunostaining
of surgical samples highlights the relevance of our mechanistic
studies to human breast cancer, as EZH2-overexpression is
significantly associated with increased p-Akt-1 and decreased
p-BRCA1 nuclear protein.
The stepwise progression from an atypical lesion to fullblown malignancy with metastatic capacity is associated with
increases in genomic instability (40). BRCA1 deficiency can
cause tetraploidy and aneuploidy (41). However, whether
EZH2 regulates genomic stability is not known. Conditional
EZH2 upregulation induced numerical chromosomal alterations in MCF10A cells as early as 72 hours after the addition of
Dox. Of note, more than 50% of polyploid cells were neartetraploid. These results are intriguing, as several lines of
evidence show that tetraploidy can be an initiator of chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis in vivo and has been
detected in human tissues before aneuploidy occurs (42–44).
Our data on CAL51 breast cancer cells support the possible
therapeutic role of EZH2 blockade in breast cancer, as EZH2
KD was sufficient to significantly decrease the percentage of
tetraploid breast cancer cells. Thus, preventing or reverting
tetraploidization through EZH2 inhibition may halt breast
cancer development.
Although multiple mechanisms can lead to aneuploidy (40),
alterations in mitosis play an important role. Overexpression
of Aurora kinases A and B are required for centrosome
maturation, bipolar spindle assembly, and mitotic entry,
and their overexpression in human cells results in abnormal
mitosis and aneuploidy (40, 45, 46). We show that transient
EZH2 overexpression in benign breast cells was sufficient to
induce aberrant mitosis with extra centrosomes. The effect of
EZH2 on mitosis was also evident in CAL51 breast cancer cells.
While CAL51 controls exhibited aberrant mitosis with supernumerary centrosomes and multiple mitotic spindles, EZH2
KD abrogated these abnormalities. Mechanistically, EZH2
overexpression increased the messenger RNA and protein
levels of Aurora kinases A and B and enhanced their kinase

activity. These data implicate EZH2 in mitosis and the
regulation of Aurora kinase function in benign and breast
cancer cells.
Although Akt has been reported to play a role in mitosis and
aneuploidy, the specific mechanisms have not been fully
defined. Similarly, the specific role of each Akt isoform in
the maintenance of genomic stability is unknown. Akt was
shown to mediate abnormal checkpoint control and aneuploidy in PTEN-deficient cells by impairing CHK1 through
phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and reduced nuclear localization (47). Especially intriguing in light of our data are results
from a recent study showing that Akt-1 activation induced
supernumerary centrosomes and genomic instability
through cytoplasmic retention of BRCA1 in a hamster ovary
cell line (25).
Here, we show that the effects of EZH2 overexpression on
mitosis and genomic instability require specific activation of
Akt-1. Interestingly, our data suggest a novel role for Akt-2
during mitosis unrelated to EZH2 expression. We observed
that Akt-2 siRNA inhibition caused a 3-fold decrease in the
number of cells undergoing mitosis in an EZH2-independent
manner. On the basis of our data, we hypothesize that the
blunting of mitoses may explain the absence of mitotic defects
in Akt-2 KD cells after induction of EZH2 overexpression, as

was observed with Akt-3 KD. The function of Akt-2 in mitosis
warrants further study.
In conclusion, these data show a novel function of EZH2 in
breast tumorigenesis: its ability to promote the nuclear export
of BRCA1 and induce aberrant mitosis and genomic instability. Our results enable us to pinpoint one mechanism by which
EZH2 controls BRCA1 intracellular localization and genomic
stability by activating Akt-1. In breast cancer cells, EZH2
downregulation induces nuclear localization of BRCA1,
decreases mitotic aberrations, and reverses tetraploidy. We
propose that modulation of EZH2 expression may be a valid
strategy to prevent or halt neoplastic progression in the
breast.
