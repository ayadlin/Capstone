BACKGROUND: Few effective therapeutic options exist for patients with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL). YM155 is a survivin suppressant with activity against DLBCL in a phase I trial. This phase II study was conducted to better characterize the toxicity and efficacy of this small molecule in patients with refractory DLBCL.
METHODS: Forty-one patients with a median age of 66 years and 3 prior regimens were enrolled and treated with a
YM155 dose of 5 mg/m2/d by continuous infusion for 168 hours every 21 days for up to 15 cycles of treatment. The
median number of completed cycles was 3. RESULTS: One patient had a complete remission (CR) (2.4%) with an
additional 2 patients (5.9%) responding, with a median progression-free survival of 58 days. CONCLUSIONS: YM155
was well tolerated with major toxicities including anemia and fatigue. Whereas YM155 had limited single-agent
activity, preclinical data suggest its role in combination with other agents, including rituximab, and a study of that

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in the United
States, accounting for a third of newly diagnosed cases.1 The incorporation of rituximab into combination with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) as initial treatment has significantly increased the
response rate and prolongation of survival such that 60% to 70% of patients may be cured.2 Nevertheless, the remaining
patients either do not respond to initial therapy or relapse after response. Whereas a fraction of patients are candidates for
and benefit from high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation, most die from their disease. Thus, there is a
compelling need for new active agents for these patients.
Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins family that has been implicated in both the preservation of cell viability and regulation of mitosis in tumor cells.3 It has been detected in at least 50% of large cell lymphoma,
but not low-grade lymphoma cell lines.4,5 Suppression of survivin would be expected to induce apoptotic cell death and
render the cells sensitive for normal cell cycle regulation.6 In a study conducted by the Groupe d’Etudes des Lymphomas
de l’Adulte (GELA), 222 patients with DLBCL were treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen.6 Using
immunohistochemistry, survivin expression was detected in 60% of patient specimens and levels were inversely correlated
with 5-year overall survival (54% vs 40% for nonexpressors vs expressors, respectively), suggesting survivin as a prognostic
factor in this disease.
YM155, 1-(2-Methoxyethyl)-2-methyl-4,9-dioxo-3-(pyrazin-2-ylmethyl)-4. 9 dihydro-1H-naptho[2,3,-d] imidazolium bromide is a small molecule survivin suppressant identified using a survivin promoter luciferase assay. It has no inhibitory effects on other antiapoptotic or cytoskeleton proteins.7 YM155 has shown in vitro antiproliferative activity
against many tumor cell lines, including malignant lymphoma cell lines in which GI50 values ranged from 0.35 nM to 11
nM. In addition, YM155 administered as monotherapy has demonstrated in vivo antitumor activity in human DLBCL

xenograft mice, showing complete (100%) growth inhibition as well as 50% and 93% tumor regression at 1 and 3
mg/kg/d, respectively. At the 3 mg/kg/d dose, 4 of 6 mice
experienced complete responses. Furthermore, the survival benefit of YM155 has been shown to be significantly
superior to that of rituximab in a human DLBCL
xenograft mouse model (Data on file, Astellas, Inc.,
Deerfield, Ill).
Two phase I trials were conducted, 1 in Japan and
the other in the United States.8,9 Thirty-four patients
with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in the Japanese
study and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 8 mg/m2/d administered over 168 hours every 3
weeks.8 The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) reported during
this study were an increased serum creatinine at 10.6 mg/
m2/d cohort. Thus, the MTD was 8.0 mg/m2/d. No clinical responses were observed in this study.
In the US study,9 41 patients with refractory solid
tumors or NHL (n ¼ 5) received 127 cycles of YM155 at
doses escalating from 1.8 to 6.0 mg/m2/d administered
over 168 hours by continuous infusion every 3 weeks. The
major toxicities were transient and reversible stomatitis,
pyrexia, nausea, and arthralgias. The DLT occurring at
the highest dose (6.0 mg/m2/d) was a reversible increase
in serum creatinine. The MTD was established as 4.8 mg/
m2/d. Serious adverse events (SAEs) recorded in 2 to 5
NHL patients included grade 2 pyrexia lasting 5 days and
considered not drug-related, grade 4 neutropenia, considered probably drug-related, and grade 4 Klebsiella bacteremia considered not related. Other grade 3 to 4 AEs,
regardless of relationship to drug and reported in more
than 1 patient included anemia, mucosal inflammation,
hepatic transaminitis, elevated international normalized
ratio (INR), hypokalemia, thrombosis, syncope, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and infections. Importantly, responses were noted in 3 refractory
NHL patients, including 2 with DLBCL. These results
encouraged a phase II trial in patients with refractory
DLBCL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients were required to be at least 18 years of age with
histologically confirmed primary DLBCL, subsequently
confirmed by central review, of any stage, and refractory
to the last treatment regimen, defined as achieving less
than a partial response (PR), or at least a PR that lasted
less than 6 months before disease progression. Patients

must have previously been treated with no more than 3
prior regimens that must have included an anthracyclinebased combination including rituximab, a second-line
chemotherapy regimen, and autologous stem cell transplantation if eligible. Patients with composite, transformed, or discordant lymphoma were excluded. Patients
who received prior allogeneic transplant were not eligible.
Patients must have had at least 1 measurable lesion 1.5
cm in its longest diameter, no central nervous system
involvement, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status 2. Required laboratory studies included a serum creatinine <1.5  upper
limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance 60 mL/
min, absolute neutrophil count >750/mm3, platelets
>50,000/mm3, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) <2.5  ULN. Patients were
required to give informed consent.

Study Design
This phase II open-label, single-arm study of YM155
planned to enroll 200 patients with refractory DLBCL.
The study was conducted at 22 centers in 4 countries
(United States, Canada, France, and Spain). Patients were
enrolled between 14 December 2007 and 21 October
2008.
Patients were treated with YM155 at a dose of 5 mg/
m2/d continuous intravenous infusion for 168 hours
through a central line or port during each 21-day cycle
using a portable electronic pump. Although the MTD
was established at 4.8 mg/m2/d based on US phase I data,
the increase to 5 mg/m2/d represents less than a 10%
increase in total dose over the 168 hours and was implemented in order to avoid potential errors in study dose
calculation. The dose of YM155 could be reduced to 3.6
mg/m2/d for unacceptable toxicity. Continued study eligibility was assessed at the conclusion of each cycle and
before the initiation of the next cycle. All patients achieving a PR as noted by computed tomography (CT) scan
were to have a confirmatory CT scan performed 6 to 8
weeks after the initial scan showing the response. In addition, patients with a complete response (CR) by CT scan
were to have confirmatory fluorodeoxyglucose-positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan within 7 days of
the confirmatory CT scan. If the patient maintained a PR
with no additional change assessed by additional CT scans
for at least 6 cycles, an FDG-PET scan was performed
within 7 days of the last CT to determine the extent of
metabolic activity.

Original Article

Patients were eligible to receive up to 15 cycles of
treatment. However, patients with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) could continue receiving YM155 as part of an
extension study if they continued to meet retreatment
criteria.
Statistical Design
The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the
overall response rate (ORR; CR þ PR) based on the International Working Group Response Criteria.10 Secondary
endpoints included evaluation of the efficacy, based upon
complete response rate, duration of response, time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival;
safety based on AEs, serious AEs, laboratory evaluations,
elecrocardiobgrams, echocardiogram, and physical
examination.
To be considered a success, this study would need to
demonstrate an ORR of at least 20% for this treatment to
be considered a success. Thus, the study would be considered successful if the lower limit for a 1-sided 97.5% confidence limit of the overall response rate was 20% or
greater. Three interim analyses for futility were planned at
approximately 50, 100, and 150 evaluable patients.
Patients were included in the interim analyses for efficacy
if they completed the study, achieved a confirmed CR or
PR, or prematurely discontinued the study without having achieved a confirmed response. If the estimated
response rate was <18%, 21% and 23%, respectively, at
the time of the interim analyses, the study would be
stopped. If the true response rate was >30%, simulation
using 10,000 repetitions shows that the power of the study
is about 0.86. An independent Data Safety Monitoring
Board (DMB) was established to review clinical efficacy
and safety data in conjuction with radiological response
data provided by an independent third-party review group
to determine the International Working Group (IWG)
response.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the 41 enrolled patients are shown in
Table 1. Two patients were found not to have been eligible as they did not meet the definition of refractory. These
patients were included in the full analysis set (FAS) but
excluded from the Per Protocol Set (PPS). The median
age of the patients enrolled was 66 years, with a median of
3 previous regimens received. Response to the last chemotherapy/biologic regimen included 1 CR (2.4%), 6 PR
(14.6%), 8 SD (19.5%), and progressive disease (PD) in

23 (56.1%). Prior response was unknown in 3 patients.
Of the 41 patients, 34 patients had confirmed histology
by an independent central pathologist. Three patients did
not have tumor samples available and for 2 patients, status
of histology was not evaluable. One patient was found to
have peripheral T-cell NHL, whereas another had follicular NHL, probably in transformation.

Response
One patient in the FAS had a CR (2.4%, 95% CI:0.1%,
12.9%), based on investigator assessment, and maintained the response until study discontinuation at cycle 7
to pursue an allogeneic transplant. This patient had
experienced a 7-month response to R-CHOP and progressive disease with rituximab plus etoposide, cytarabine, cisplatinum, and methylprednisolone (R-ESHAP).

because of the high rate of patients progressing without
any confirmed responses. Therefore, in order to limit exposure of patients to an experimental agent that was demonstrating limited activity, an analysis was conducted at
25 evaluable patients. This analysis showed that the probability of successfully achieving the first protocol mandated interim analysis (<9 responses/50 patients) was
1.1%, and for the final efficacy analysis (<52 responses/
200 patients), it was 0.2%.

Toxicity
AE data are presented in Table 2. All patients experienced
at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (78% were considered
drug-related); 58.5% of patients experienced an SAE.
Only 39% and 2.4% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4
treatment-related AEs, respectively. The specific toxicities
are listed in Table 3, the most common being anemia
(14.6%), fatigue (12.2%), with the remaining toxicities
occurring in fewer than 10% of patients. There were 8

Of the 41 patients enrolled at either the original 5
mg/m2/d or reduced 3.6 mg/m2/d, 29 initiated cycle 2,
22 cycle 3, 13 cycle 4, 10 cycle 5, 8 cycle 6, 5 cycle 7, 4
cycle 8, 2 cycle 9, and 1 at cycles 10-12. The median number of cycles completed was 3 (1-12). One patient (2.4%)
completed 12 cycles of therapy. Dose reductions from 5.0
mg/m2 to 3.6 mg/m2 occurred in 3 (7.3%) patients, and
19.5% experienced a temporary discontinuation of drug.
Five patients (12.2%) discontinued treatment due to
adverse events. Reasons for discontinuation of therapy
excluding disease progression included: thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 1), myocardial infarction (n ¼ 1), cardiac failure
(n ¼ 1), pyrexia, fatigue, asthenia and nausea (n ¼ 1), and
cardiac arrest due to disease progression (n ¼ 1). The
myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest
were likely due to disease progression and were not considered related to study drug. Thirty-four patients
(82.9%) discontinued therapy due to progressive disease.
In 2 patients the plan was to proceed to stem cell transplant (4.9%): 1 who was the responder and a second who
progressed before undergoing transplant.
Pharmacokinetics, Biomarkers,and
Pharmacogenomics
The median YM155 concentration after 4 days of infusion, but before the end of the infusion was 10.4 ng/mL
(Table 3). The median plasma YM155 concentration
observed in this study was consistent with the previous
phase I studies.9

DISCUSSION
The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy
represented the first major advance in the treatment of
patients with DLBCL, increasing the CR rate and prolonging survival when compared with chemotherapy

alone. However, 40% of patients either do not respond or
relapse, and the management of patients with relapsed
and refractory DLBCL remains a challenge. A small proportion of patients may benefit from autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, no agents are
currently approved for this indication.
YM155 is a small molecule survivin suppressant that
has been studied in multiple phase 1 and 2 trials enrolling
a variety of solid tumors and lymphomas. Satoh et al8 enrolled 33 evaluable patients with a variety of solid tumors
onto a Japanese phase I trial with renal toxicity being
dose-limiting, but no clinical responses. Tolcher et al9 enrolled 41 patients into a US phase I study and reported 3
of 5 responders in NHL (1 CR in DLBCL, 2 PRS
[DLBCL and follicular NHL]), and 2 of 9 responders
with prostate cancer. The DLT in this study was reversible
elevation in serum creatinine. Lewis et al11 reported a
phase II study of YM155 in 34 chemotherapy naive
patients with unresectable stage III or IV malignant melanoma that showed the drug was relatively well tolerated;
however, 1 patient developed reversible acute renal failure.
One patient had a PR per independent review with an
additional patient considered a PR per investigator assessment. Nine (26.5%) patients were able to receive 6 cycles
of YM155. Unfortunately, the efficacy endpoint of 2
responses of 29 patients was not met. Giaccone et al12 enrolled 37 patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer in a phase 1 study and achieved 2 PRs, for an ORR of
5.4% with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 1.7
months.
In the current study the single agent activity of
YM155 was limited with a response rate of 2.4% (95%
CI, 0.1%-12.9%) resulting in early study termination for
futility. Whereas the 2.4% response rate in the current
trial is lower than anticipated, there was evidence of biologic activity in 11 patients (Fig. 2). Moreover, the experience with a number of small molecules suggests that
modest single agent activity should not be a deterrent to
further drug development if there is sufficient scientific
rational. Examples of other agents with minimal single
agent activity but with demonstrated clinical benefit or
promise when combined with other agents include bevacizumab, ABT-263, AT-101, and others.
YM155 was active against a number of aggressive
NHL cell lines in vitro, and was also able to eradicate even
large established tumors in a number of in vivo models, to
a greater extent than rituximab,13 associated with a downregulation of survivin. Using WSU-DLCL-2, a human
DLBCL cell line, the antitumor activity of YM155 in

Cancer

June 15, 2012

combination with rituximab was examined. There were
10 animals in the control and rituximab groups and 9 in
the YM155 group. On day 7 after cell injection, animals
were treated with YM155 monotherapy at 3 mg/kg/d by
continuous infusion for 7 days, or rituximab at 50 mg/kg/
d intraperitoneally, each given once every 3 weeks for 5
courses. The control animals all died of disseminated disease at a median of 19 days. YM155 completely inhibited
tumor growth, induced tumor regression, and extended
survival to 64 days (P < .01), which was longer than with
rituximab (34 days) (P < .01). Furthermore, the combination of rituximab and YM155 was superior to rituximab alone in DLBCL xenograts.14 Thus, the
combination regimen is currently being investigated in an
ongoing clinical trial. YM155 more likely has a role in
potentiating the efficacy of other agents.
Appropriate patients with DLBCL who are not
cured with initial R-CHOP may be treated with aggressive chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Nevertheless, most patients never undergo
transplantation because of refractory disease, age, or
comorbidities that preclude aggressive treatment after
relapse after R-CHOP. In addition, most patients who
undergo autologous stem cell transplantation are not
cured and no therapies are currently approved for that indication. Thus, there is a need for effective treatments for
those patients.
The current study demonstrates that YM155 has
limited activity in refractory DLBCL as a single agent, but
appeared to be reasonably well tolerated. However, preclinical data suggest that YM155 may have a role in combination strategies with the potential to improve the
outcome of patients with NHL.
