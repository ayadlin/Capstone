Abstract
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) links several cellular processes, including proliferation and survival, and is believed to
be involved in carcinogenesis. However, the role of JNK in
gastric tumorigenesis is unknown. Immunohistochemical
analysis reveals that JNK is frequently activated in human
gastric cancer tissue. We investigated whether JNK1, a major
JNK isozyme, is involved in chemically induced gastric cancer
development. Mice lacking JNK1 exhibited a marked decrease
in gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea,
relative to their wild-type counterparts. Impaired tumor
development correlated with decreased tumor initiation,
which is associated with the production of reactive oxygen
species. We also found that lower levels of tumorigenesis were
correlated with the decreased expression of cyclin D and CDK
as well as decreased cell proliferation. Taken together, JNK
seems to be involved in both tumor initiation and promotion
and may be an attractive target for the prevention of gastric
carcinogenesis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5031–9]

Introduction
The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) belongs to a family of
mitogen-activated protein kinases, together with extracellular
regulated kinases and p38. The JNK subgroup of mitogen-activated
protein kinases is encoded by three loci: Jnk1 and Jnk2 are
ubiquitously expressed, and Jnk3 is expressed primarily in heart,
testis, and brain (1–3). JNKs are activated by stress signals and
proinflammatory stimuli.
Activated JNKs phosphorylate c-Jun, JunD, activating transcription factor, and other transcriptional factors, which are involved in
the formation and activation of the activator-protein 1 (AP-1)
complex (4). JNK activation has been shown to induce apoptosis,
cell proliferation, or transformation, depending on the cell type and
stimuli (5).
Using gene knockout mice, it was shown that JNKs are involved
in many processes, including liver inflammation and proliferation,
neuronal apoptosis, T cell activation, and insulin resistance (6–10).
With regard to carcinogenesis, Tong and colleagues reported that
JNK1 knockout mice spontaneously developed intestinal tumors,
suggesting a role for JNK1 in the suppression of tumor formation in
the intestine (11). In contrast, mice lacking JNK1 were much less

susceptible to diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis,
which was correlated with decreased cyclin D and vascular
endothelial growth factor expression, diminished cell proliferation,
and reduced tumor neovascularization (12). These findings suggest
that JNKs can have tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing
functions, depending on the cell type or organ.
Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths
worldwide. The incidence of gastric cancer has been declining in
recent decades. A high-salt diet, smoked foods rich in nitrates, and
water contaminated with Helicobacter pylori seem to be major
environmental inducers of gastric cancer (13–16). A high-salt diet
disrupts the gastric mucosal barrier, and N-nitroso mutagens
formed from dietary nitrates in a hypochlorhydric stomach can
damage DNA (13). The role of H. pylori in causing mucosal effects
has been heavily investigated because of the possibility that some
cancers could be prevented with antibiotics against H. pylori (16).
However, it remains unclear which molecular signals actually
initiate the program of irreversible transformation.
N-nitroso mutagens, which are important gastric carcinogens,
are potent inducers of cellular stress, leading to chromosomal
aberrations, point mutations, cell death, and DNA damage. It has
been reported that these agents induce a specific cellular stress
response program, which includes the activation of JNKs and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (17).
To explore the role of JNK in gastric carcinogenesis, we used
JNK1 knockout mice as an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)–
mediated gastric cancer model. Mice lacking JNK1 exhibited a
marked decrease in gastric carcinogenesis caused by MNU, relative
to wild-type controls. The impaired tumor development correlated
with decreased tumor initiation, which is associated with reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production. We also found that the reduced
tumorigenesis correlated with decreased expression of cyclin D and
CDK, resulting in decreased cell proliferation. JNK1 thus seems to
be involved in both tumor initiation and promotion steps and may
be an attractive target for the prevention of gastric carcinogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Mice. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute
for Adult Diseases, Asahi Life Foundation. Animal experiments were
conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the Institute for Adult Diseases, Asahi Life
Foundation. C57BL/6 J mice were obtained from Tokyo Laboratory Animal
Science (Tokyo, Japan). The Jnk1 / mice have been previously described
(18). All mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions with a
12/12-h light/dark cycle.
Gastric cancer model. MNU (Sigma Chemical) was dissolved in distilled
water at a concentration of 240 ppm and was freshly prepared twice per
week for administration in drinking water in light-shielded bottles.
The 6-week-old wild-type and Jnk1 / mice were given drinking water

containing 240 ppm of MNU on alternate weeks for a total of 5 weeks
of exposure, according to a protocol described in a previous report (19).
The MNU-treated mice were sacrificed at 40 weeks after starting MNU
administration.
Preparation of tissue samples for tumor counting and histologic
analysis. The stomach was removed and opened along the greater
curvature. The number and the long diameter of the tumors in the
stomach were measured under a dissecting microscope (5 magnification).
Tumors >1.0 mm in diameter were mapped and counted. After counting, all
of the excised stomachs were fixed for 24 h in neutral-buffered 10%
formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 Am, and stained with H&E.
Immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Sections were deparaffinized,

rehydrated, treated with 3% H2O2 in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4jC
with anti–phosphorylated JNK1, anti-JNK1, anti–phosphorylated c-Jun
(Cell Signaling Technology), and anti–proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. The binding of the primary
antibody was detected with biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-rat IgG
antibodies (1:500 dilution; Vector Laboratories), followed by a streptavidin–
horseradish peroxidase reaction, visualization with 3,3-diaminobenzidine
(Sigma-Aldrich), and counterstaining with hematoxylin. No specific staining
was observed in the negative control slides prepared without primary
antibody. To evaluate epithelial cell apoptosis, a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ApopAlert DNA fragmentation assay
kit; TAKARA Bio, Inc., Japan).

Human tissue array. A human tissue array was purchased from Isu
Abxis Co., Ltd. Immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated JNK1 or JNK1
was performed as above. We counted >100 cells in three microscopic
fields (magnification, 200). When >30% of the cells were positive for
phosphorylated JNK, we defined the tumor as phosphorylated JNKpositive.
Cells and MNU treatment. Fibroblasts derived from wild-type and
Jnk1 / mouse embryos were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FCS (20). Rat
gastric epithelia cell line, RGM1, and human gastric cancer cell lines, AGS,
SH101, and MKN1, were maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin-G, and
100 Ag/mL of streptomycin. For transformation analysis, cells were exposed
to MNU (100 Ag/mL) for 1 h, once a week for up to 6 weeks. Cell numbers
were determined with a cell counting kit, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Dojindo Laboratories). For other in vitro analyses, cells were
exposed to MNU (200 Ag/mL).
Immunoblot and kinase assay. Protein lysates were prepared from
cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), separated by SDS-PAGE,
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and
analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The antibodies
used were anti-JNK1, anti-PCNA, anti-Cdc2, anti-Cdk2, anti–cyclin-A,
anti–cyclin-D1, and anti–cyclin-E (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
and anti–phosphorylated JNK1, anti–phosphorylated c-Jun, anti–c-Jun,
anti-tubulin, and anti–phosphorylated p53 (all from Cell Signaling). A JNK
immune complex kinase assay was performed as described elsewhere
(21), using anti-JNK1 antibody (PharMingen) and glutathione S-transferase
c-Jun (1–79) as a substrate. The basal JNK1 level was monitored by
immunoblotting.

DNA damage detection. DNA damage induced by MNU treatment was
analyzed using a DNA damage quantification kit (Oxford Biomedical
Research, Inc.). In brief, DNA was isolated from MNU-stimulated and
control MEFs using a DNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen). Apurinic/apyrimidinic
(AP) sites were detected in isolated DNA using an aldehyde-reactive probe
reagent. After treating the DNA with the aldehyde-reactive probe reagent,
AP sites were tagged with biotin, and the DNA was bound to a microtiter
plate, along with aldehyde-reactive probe–tagged DNA standards. The
number of AP sites in the sample DNAs was determined by absorbance at
450 nm and comparison with a standard curve.
Xenograft tumor model. MEFs (1  105) with or without MNU
treatment were injected s.c. into the flanks of 6-week-old male/female nude
mice. The sizes of the resulting tumors were measured with calipers at each
time point for 28 days.
Small interfering RNA, transfection, and reagents. RNA oligonucleotides for small interfering RNA (siRNA) were synthesized by Dharmacon
Inc. All siRNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). All siRNAs were tested
and verified as reducing expression, leading to 80% reduction in protein
in AGS and SH101 cells as determined by immunoblot analysis. The JNK
inhibitor SP600215 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 were from
Calbiochem.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Gastric tissues
from MNU-treated mice were examined for mRNA expression by
quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was extracted using
ISOGEN reagents (Nippon Gene), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The cDNA was generated using SuperScript II (Invitrogen Life Technologies), and the amounts of the different mRNAs were measured by real-time

Results
JNK activation in human gastric cancer tissues. To determine
whether JNK was activated in human gastric cancer tissues, tissue
sections from 40 gastric cancers, including adenocarcinomas and
signet ring cell carcinomas, were immunohistochemically stained
with anti–phosphorylated JNK or anti-JNK1 antibody (Fig. 1A). JNK
activation was seen in 40% of adenocarcinomas and in 23% of
signet ring cell carcinomas, whereas noncancerous tissues showed
no apparent activation. There was no association between JNK
activation and either the intestinal and diffuse subtypes of gastric
cancer (data not shown). Intestinal metaplasia and gastritis tissues
showed a small number of epithelial cells with JNK activation
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Total JNK1 was expressed in all cancerous
and noncancerous tissues (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that JNK
is frequently activated in gastric cancer tissues and suggest that
this activation may play a role in cancer development.
Loss of JNK1 attenuates gastric tumor development. To
explore the role of JNK in gastric cancer development, we used a
mouse model of chemically induced gastric carcinogenesis. The
administration of MNU to mice results in efficient gastric cancer
induction (22). Of the two JNK loci expressed in the stomach,
Jnk1 and Jnk2, Jnk1-encoded isoforms were primarily responsible
for cell proliferation (7) and cell death (23). Wild-type and Jnk1 /
male mice, both from a C57BL/6 background, were given drinking
water containing MNU in light-shielded bottles on alternate weeks

(total exposure was 5 weeks) and then normal tap water until
week 40. All wild-type mice (100%) given MNU developed gastric
tumors, but gastric tumors were induced in only four of nine (44%)
Jnk1 / mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B). In addition, the number of
detectable gastric tumors was significantly reduced in Jnk1 /
mice, as were maximal tumor diameters (Fig. 1C). These data
suggest that JNK1 is required for efficient gastric tumor induction
in response to MNU administration.
JNK1-deficient tumors exhibited decreased cell proliferation. A representative adenocarcinoma lesion is shown in Fig. 2A.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed many PCNA-positive cells
in wild-type tumors (Fig. 2A). Cells positive for phosphorylated
c-Jun and JNK were also found in tumors (Fig. 2A) but not in
background tissues (data not shown). Jnk1 / tumors contained a
few cells with phosphorylated c-Jun and phosphorylated JNK, and
fewer PCNA-positive cells than wild-type cells (Fig. 2A), but there
was no significant difference in the number of apoptotic cells or
cells positive for PCNA between the background tissues (Fig. 2C;
further data not shown). We also examined the expression of
known cell cycle regulators in tumors of both genotypes. The levels
of cyclin D1, PCNA, and CDK2 in the average size of tumors of both
genotypes were substantially higher in wild-type tumors than in
Jnk1 / tumors (Fig. 2B).
JNK1 deficiency decreased cellular transformation. A single
oral administration of MNU induced JNK activation in the gastric
epithelium at 4 hours (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether JNK1
contributed to tumor initiation, we analyzed the effect of MNU
treatment on MEF. JNK activation was observed after 15 minutes
of MNU administration, and this activation declined to almost
basal levels at 120 minutes. With longer observations, however, the
activity was elevated again at 4 to 12 hours (Fig. 3B). We also

detection kit. B, MEFs were exposed to MNU (100 Ag/mL) for 1 h, once a week for up to 6 wk. After the initial (first) and sixth treatments, cell numbers were determined
with a cell-counting kit. C, MEFs were exposed to MNU as above. Cells were lysed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies to the indicated
proteins. D, growth curves of MEFs implanted into immunodeficient nude mice. MNU-treated wild-type MEFs grew (left side of mouse back ), but Jnk1 / MEFs

observed JNK activation by MNU administration in RGM1, rat
gastric epithelial cells, and MKN1, gastric cancer cells (Fig. 3C).
MNU is a multisystem teratogen that damages proliferating cells
through macromolecule alkylation and generation of ROS (24).
Increased ROS production is a major factor in JNK activation and
acute injury, at least in the liver, and both of these can be prevented
by antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA; ref. 25).
Thus, we next assessed whether MNU-mediated JNK activation
was ROS-dependent. MNU increased ROS production in both wildtype and Jnk1 / MEFs at almost the same level (data not shown).
As in the liver, pretreatment with BHA significantly blocked
activation of JNK by MNU in MEFs, RGM1 and MKN1 (Fig. 3C).
To investigate whether JNK activation resulted in cellular
transformation after MNU administration, we analyzed MNUmediated DNA damage in both wild-type and Jnk1 / MEFs, using
a DNA damage detection kit. We found that MNU, an alkylating
agent, strongly induced DNA damage in wild-type MEFs but not in
Jnk1 / cells (Fig. 4A). Next, to assess whether MNU induced
transformation in MEFs, we treated wild-type and Jnk1 / cells
with MNU for 1 h, once a week for up to 6 weeks. We counted cell
numbers until 8 weeks after the initial treatment. Wild-type cells
started to die at 12 hours after the initial MNU treatment, and the
number of cells was decreased by up to 50% at 72 hours. In
contrast, cell viability of Jnk1 / cells was unchanged by this

www.aacrjournals.org

treatment. Wild-type cells were also considerably more sensitive to
MNU compared with Jnk1 / cells at the final treatment. Finally,
both cells started to grow 48 hours after the final treatment
(Fig. 4B). We analyzed cell cycle–associated proteins by Western
blotting after 8 weeks and found that cdc2 and cyclin A were
increased in MNU-treated wild-type cells but not in Jnk1 / cells
(Fig. 4C). c-Jun was detected and increased only in wild-type
cells (Fig. 4C). We also analyzed the potential of cells growing in
soft agar and found that wild-type cells yielded a number of
colonies, whereas Jnk1 / cells did not (data not shown). Finally,
we implanted the cells into immunodeficient nude mice and
found that MNU-treated wild-type cells, but not Jnk1 / cells, grew
(Fig. 4D). Untreated cells did not grow in nude mice. These results
suggest that JNK1 plays an important role in MNU-mediated
transformation.
Loss of JNK1 attenuates MNU-mediated apoptosis. Cell injury
is an important process for compensatory proliferation and is
linked to carcinogenesis (12, 25). In vitro, MNU induced lower levels
of cell death in Jnk1 / cells, compared with wild-type cells, as
above. We investigated apoptotic cell death, which is strongly
associated with JNK activation by certain stimuli such as tumor
necrosis factor-a and MNU treatment. Oral MNU administration
caused more gastric apoptosis in wild-type mice than in Jnk1 /
mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). MNU-treated wild-type cells showed

more apoptosis than similarly treated Jnk1 / cells, whereas no
obvious difference was found between wild-type and Jnk1 /
cells without MNU treatment (Fig. 5A). MNU-treated MKN1 also
showed more apoptosis than similarly treated JNK1 knockdown
cells of MKN1 (JNK1 siRNA), whereas no obvious difference was
found without MNU treatment (Fig. 5A).
In wild-type cells, MNU treatment resulted in the phosphorylation of p53, one of the most important molecules in inducing
apoptosis owing to DNA-damaging agents such as MNU, and this
response was markedly attenuated in Jnk1 / cells (Fig. 5B). We
also observed that phosphorylation of p53 by MNU was attenuated
in JNK1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5B). The activation of p53 by
MNU was also inhibited by treatment with the antioxidant BHA,
suggesting that p53 activation was ROS-dependent and JNKdependent (Fig. 5C). The mRNA levels of Noxa, an apoptotic
mediator induced by p53 activation, was significantly lower in
MNU-treated Jnk1 / mice than in similarly treated wild-type
controls (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that JNK1 contributed to
MNU-induced apoptosis by promoting the ROS-dependent activation of p53. The mechanism of p53 modulation by JNK1 remains to
be elucidated.

Loss of JNK1 attenuates cancer cell growth. Proliferation is
also an important step in carcinogenesis. Not only tumor number
but also tumor size were decreased in Jnk1 / mice. We thus
investigated the possible role of JNK in tumor cell proliferation.
Gastric cancer cells, SH101 and AGS, were cultured with or without
a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, or a MEK inhibitor, PD98059. Cell
numbers were significantly inhibited by treatment with the JNK
inhibitor, whereas the effect of the MEK inhibitor was modest
(Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis of the proliferation-associated and
cell cycle–associated proteins PCNA, cdc2, cyclin D1, and c-Jun
showed that they were also decreased by the JNK inhibitor
(Fig. 6B). We used JNK1 siRNA in SH101 and MKN1 cells and found
that proliferation-regulated and cell cycle–regulated genes were
decreased by JNK1 inhibition (Fig. 6C and D). These results suggest
that not only tumor initiation, which is defined as transformation,
but also tumor proliferation were dependent on JNK activation.

Discussion
In the current study, we showed that JNK1 activation was important
in gastric cancer development induced by the DNA-alkylating agent

MNU. Moreover, we also showed that it is important in both
initiation and promotion steps.
Regarding the initiation step, a role for JNKs in oncogenic
transformation has been previously suggested (26, 27). Originally,
JNKs were identified as protein kinases that phosphorylated c-Jun
on serine residues (28). c-Jun is a well-characterized oncogene,
especially in liver (29), and its phosphorylation by JNK may be of
relevance in hepatocellular carcinogenesis (12). In addition,
Rennefahrt and colleagues reported that constitutive JNK activation induced transformation without oncogenic induction (30).
We showed that MNU activated JNK for a relatively long time
and strongly induced c-Jun phosphorylation, dependent on JNK
activation. We also showed that JNK was involved in transformation by MNU in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first
report in which JNK activation is involved in transformation by
extracellular stimuli and not by intracellular oncogenic overexpression.
The pathogenesis of human gastric cancer is a multistep and
multifactorial process (31). The complex of cellular and molecular
changes can be mediated by many endogenous and environmental
agents, including free radicals, H. pylori infection, bile reflux, high

www.aacrjournals.org

salt intake, and low consumption of some vitamins (31). Free
radicals or ROS are low molecular weight metabolites sufficiently
reactive to damage essential biological molecules. The release of
ROS inside the nuclear membrane of a cell can damage DNA and
induce mutations, which is a basis for carcinogenesis (32). In this
study, we showed that ROS were necessary for JNK activation by
MNU. This indicates that ROS are an important factor in MNUmediated transformation through JNK and are involved in the
transformation of gastric epithelial cells. It remains unknown
whether other carcinogens for gastric cancer, such as H. pylori, also
involve ROS-mediated carcinogenesis through JNK activation.
With regard to the role of c-Jun in carcinogenesis involving JNK
activation, it has been reported that c-Jun, phosphorylated by JNK,
interacts with the HMG-box transcription factor TCF4 to form a
ternary complex containing c-Jun, TCF4, and h-catenin. In the
Apc(Min) mouse model of intestinal cancer, genetic abrogation of
c-Jun NH2-terminal phosphorylation or gut-specific conditional
c-Jun inactivation reduced tumor number and size and prolonged
life span (33). This mechanism may also be involved in MNUinduced carcinogenesis and needs examination. Consistent with
this, the expression of cyclin D, which is regulated by the WNT and

AP-1 pathways, decreased in the JNK1 knockout group in this
study. Similarly, in liver tumor development, disruption of
JNK1 decreased chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis and
chemical-induced AP-1 activity, producing a modest decrease in
c-Jun protein levels. The absence of JNK1 resulted in decreased
expression of cyclin D proteins, which are important for hepatocyte
and hepatoma cell proliferation (12).
In contrast to these findings, JNK can also act as a tumor
suppressor. Mice deficient in JNK1 exhibited enhanced sensitivity
for skin tumorigenesis (34). The upstream activator of JNKs, MKK4,
has been identified as a metastasis suppressor in human cancers.
Regarding gastrointestinal organs, it is reported that JNK1 plays a
critical role in the suppression of tumor formation in the intestine,
which has been linked to the altered expression of p21 (11). In
contrast, we have checked the stomachs of more than 30 mice and
detected no spontaneous tumors. In addition, p21 expression was
not changed between wild-type and JNK1 / mice. These results
suggest that JNK1 seems to play a tumor-promoting role in the
stomach. However, because of the opposing roles of JNKs in cancer,
it is important to define the dominant role of JNKs in a specific
cancer before JNK inhibitors can be widely employed as a cancer
chemotherapeutic.
We focused on the transformation and proliferation of gastric
epithelial cells in particular. However, it is necessary to examine
the environment of the cells, including the levels of growth factors
and inflammatory cytokines. It has been reported that JNK affects
the expression of various factors through activation of c-Jun/AP-1,
which is downstream of JNK. For example, angiogenic factors such
as vascular endothelial growth factor or interleukin-8 are transcribed by an AP-1–dependent pathway (35, 36). Consistent with
this, it has been reported that the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor in a liver cancer model was decreased
in JNK1 knockout mice (12). We also analyzed the gene expression

profiles of MNU-treated mouse stomachs and found that the
expression of several inflammatory cytokines such as tumor
necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 was slightly decreased in JNK
knockout mice, compared with wild-type controls.4
DNA damage by MNU was decreased by a deficiency in JNK1,
showing that DNA damage and subsequent immortality apparently
involve the activation of JNK. On the other hand, through
phosphorylation of p53, cells with DNA damage are removed by
apoptosis (37). The attenuation of JNK activation by MNU in JNK1deficient cells, which we showed here, may result in both decreased
immortality and cell death attenuation and, as a result, decreased
carcinogenesis. It is believed that increased cell death activates
inflammation in neighboring cells, and much of the observed
compensatory proliferation depends on cytokines produced by
inflammatory cells (25). It would be very difficult to prove this
hypothesis in vivo, but gastric mucosal injury and inflammatory
cell infiltration were readily observed after MNU administration.4
In conclusion, mice lacking JNK1 exhibited a marked decrease in
gastric carcinogenesis caused by MNU, relative to wild-type
controls. The impaired tumor development correlated with
decreased transformation, which is associated with ROS production, and decreased cell proliferation. JNK1, therefore, is involved in
both tumor initiation and promotion and may be an attractive
target for the prevention of gastric carcinogenesis.
