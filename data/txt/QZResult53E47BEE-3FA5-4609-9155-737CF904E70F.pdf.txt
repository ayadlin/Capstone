Abstract
The presence of activated intratumoral T cells correlates clinically with better prognosis in patients with
cancer. Although tumor vaccines can increase the number of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells in systemic circulation,
they frequently fail to increase the number of active and tumor reactive T cells within the tumor. Here we show
that treatment with the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) induces speciﬁc activation of tumor-resident
CD8þ T cells as well as their intratumoral expansion in several mouse tumor models. We found that inhibition of
T-cell trafﬁcking from lymphoid organs did not impair IL-10–induced tumor rejection or the activation of tumorresident CD8þ T cells. Tumor-resident CD8þ T cells expressed elevated levels of the IL-10 receptor and were
directly activated by IL-10, resulting in prominent phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1. Although CD4þ T cells,
regulatory T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells have been reported as prominent targets of IL-10 in the tumor
microenvironment, we found that expression of the IL-10R was required only on CD8þ T cells to facilitate IL-10–
induced tumor rejection as well as in situ expansion and proliferation of tumor-resident CD8 T cells. Together, our
ﬁndings indicate that IL-10 activates CD8þ T-cell–mediated tumor control and suggest that IL-10 may represent a
potential tumor immunotherapy in human patients with cancer. Cancer Res; 72(14); 3570–81. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine most recognized for its
antiinﬂammatory properties. IL-10 achieves this suppression
of inﬂammatory responses by inhibiting the expression of
MHC class II, costimulatory molecules, and proinﬂammatory
cytokines in APCs (1). This inhibition of APC function in turn
limits the magnitude of T-cell responses. In addition, IL-10
directly inhibits the activation and cytokine secretion of CD4þ
T cells (2–4). The absence of IL-10 can lead to increased tumor
clearance in response to intratumoral CpG injection (5), stronger T-cell immunity induced by tumor-cell vaccines (6) and it
has been suggested that IL-10 contributes to the immunesuppressive environment of tumors.
Contrasting these ﬁndings, local release of IL-10 from
transfected tumor cells (7–10) or therapeutic administration
of IL-10 induces strong antitumor immune responses and

leads to tumor rejection in a variety of mouse tumor models
(11–13).
Despite these ﬁndings, IL-100 s direct target cell types and
their location in vivo have not been identiﬁed. We and others
have previously shown that the antitumor effect of IL-10
depends on CD8þ T cells (7, 9, 10, 12). In vitro, IL-10 induces
the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of CD8þ T cells and is a
chemoattractant for CD8þ T cells (14–17). However, whether
IL-10 directly acts on CD8þ T cells during IL-10–mediated
tumor rejection in vivo or if the activation of CD8þ T cells is a
secondary event, mediated by other cells is not known.
Surprisingly, we show that IL-10–mediated activation of
tumor-resident CD8þ T cells alone is sufﬁcient, to reject wellestablished large tumors, without the requirement for other cells
to respond to IL-10. Moreover, IL-10 induces the expansion of IL10R proﬁcient CD8þ T cells through proliferation.

IL-10 Activates and Expands Tumor Resident CD8þ T cells

All animal procedures were approved by the IACUC of MRL/
PA in accordance with guidelines of Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
International.
Tumor models
To generate the PDV6-OVA tumor cell line, parental PDV6
cells (18) were transfected with a plasmid expressing a CMV
promoter–driven cytoplasmic form of OVA (cOVA; amino
acids 20–145; ref. 19).
Tumor implantations were done as previously described
(12). Tumors were left untreated for at least 10 days before
injection with 5 to 10 mg of DNA using a hydrodynamic
technique.
PEG-IL-10 was injected at 0.1 mg/kg twice a day. CD8
T-cell depletion was done as previously described (12).
FTY720 (Cayman Chemical) was dissolved in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. A dose of
1 mg/kg was administered by i.p. injection 3 times per week.
Tumor growth was monitored twice per week, recorded
as 0.5  length  (width)2 and plotted as mean tumor
volume  SEM.
Tumor-inﬁltrating immune cell analysis and ﬂow
cytometry
Single-cell suspensions from tumors and lymph nodes were
generated as described (12) and directly used for ﬂow cytometric analyses. To analyze STAT activation, 5 to 7 tumors
were pooled and T cells were puriﬁed by positive selection with
anti-CD90 MACS multisort microbeads followed by anti-CD45
MACS microbeads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi). Puriﬁed tumor-inﬁltrating T cells (TIL) were
rested in 10% FCS, IMDM overnight followed by a 20-minute
stimulation with 100 ng/mL mouse IL-10 (R&D).
Fluorescence-labeled antibodies against CD11b, CD8a,
CD4, CD45, CD45.2, IL-10Ra, NK1.1, IFNg, STAT1 (pY701),
STAT3 (pY705), STAT4 (pY693), STAT5 (pY694), and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were all purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies to CD45.1 and Foxp3 were purchased
from e-Bioscience. For detection of intracellular IFNg, cells
were stained without further in vitro restimulation using
the Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Kit (BD Biosciences). Intracellular
staining kits for BrdU (BD), Foxp3, and Phospho-STAT
(Phosﬂow, BD) were used according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Flow cytometric data were acquired on a
FACSCantoII (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo software
(Tree Star).
IL-10 minicircle
The p2øC31.RSV.hAAT.bpA plasmid (encoding humana1
anti-trypsin) was provided by Dr Zhi-Ying Chen (Stanford
University, CA, USA). For IL-10 minicircle, the hAAT was
replaced with mIL10 cDNA. Plasmids using the Ubiquitin
promoter instead of the RSV promoter were also generated.
Injection of both minicircles resulted in comparable IL-10
serum levels.
Minicircle DNA production followed (20) with minor
modiﬁcations.

Adoptive T-cell transfer
Splenocyte suspensions of WT (CD45.1þ/) and IL-10Rb/
(CD45.1þ/þ) OT-I mice were adoptively transferred into congenic hosts (CD45.2þ/þ) bearing PDV6-OVA tumors via tail
vein injection. The frequency of Tg CD8þ T cells was determined by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) before
transfer and equal numbers of WT and IL-10Rb/ CD8þ OT-I
T cells were transferred.
In vitro activation of CD8þ OT-I T cells
Splenocyte suspensions of C57BL/6 OT-I mice were activated with 1 mg/mL SIINFEKL peptide (Bio-Synthesis) in 24-well
plates.
Gene expression analysis and statistical methods
All mRNA analysis was conducted using quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR as previously described (12). Statistical
analysis was conducted using Prism software.

Results
IL-10 treatment induces activation of CD8þ T cells
and tumor rejection
We have recently shown that PEGylated IL-10 (PEG-IL-10)
controls tumor growth and induces tumor rejection in a wide
variety of tumor models (Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 12).
mRNA analysis of tumors from control and IL-10–treated mice
revealed that IL-10 induces a strong increase in the expression
of the cytotoxic effector molecules granzyme B and perforin
and of the effector cytokine IFNg. In contrast, IL-10 induced
only minor changes of these effector molecules in the tumordraining lymph node (TDLN; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Isolation of inﬂammatory cells from tumors showed that PEG-IL-10
induced an increased presence of intratumoral CD8þ T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Antibody mediated ablation of
CD8þ T cells abrogated tumor rejection (Supplementary Fig.
1D). However, most tumor models required PEG-IL-10 to be
administered twice a day, making the usage of PEG-IL-10 for
further mechanistic studies tedious and ﬁnancially prohibitive.
Therefore, we used the hydrodynamic delivery of an IL-10–
encoding minicircle plasmid (21) to further study the molecular mechanisms underlying the potent antitumor efﬁcacy of
IL-10. The location of the delivery and expression of such
intravenously injected plasmids is predominantly in the liver,
resulting in high prevalence of secreted proteins in the serum.
Mice with established PDV6 tumors injected with the IL-10
minicircle, displayed very high IL-10 serum concentrations
immediately after the injection (Fig. 1A), which subsequently
stabilized in the 10 to 100 ng/mL range. IL-10 was undetectable
after control minicircle injection (data not shown). The IL-10
levels were sufﬁcient to promote rejection of established PDV6
tumors (Fig. 1B). In contrast, IL-10 treatment was ineffective in
IL-10Rb/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), indicating
that IL-10 acts on the host but not the tumor cells, and in
RAG/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S2C), indicating the importance of the adaptive immune system in the IL-10 response.
Similarly, established CT26 tumors were rejected in IL-10–
treated mice, but not in control mice (Supplementary Fig. S3A,

gray lines). These data conﬁrm the previously reported potent
antitumor efﬁcacy of IL-10 and show the usefulness of the
IL-10 minicircle for further mechanistic studies.
Next, we investigated IFNg induction in tumor-resident
CD8þ T cells by IL-10 using ﬂow cytometry. Cells obtained
from CT26 tumors or TDLN of control or IL-10–treated mice
were stained for intracellular IFNg without any further in vitro
restimulation. IFNg was not detectable in CD4þ and CD8þ T
cells isolated from TDLN of control or IL-10–treated mice. A
small percentage of CD4þ TILs produced IFNg but this population did not change in response to IL-10 treatment. In
contrast, the frequency of CD8þ TILs producing IFNg
increased on average 3-fold upon IL-10 treatment (Fig. 1C and
D; ref. 12). These data show that IL-10 treatment leads to an
increase in the frequency of IFNg producing CD8þ T cells in the
tumor.
IL-10–mediated tumor rejection does not require
de novo T-cell inﬁltration
IFNg induces the chemokines MIG (CXCL9) and IP-10
(CXCL10), two potent chemoattractants for IFNg producing
T cells (22). The mRNA of MIG and IP-10 was induced by
IL-10 in the tumor but not in secondary lymphoid organs
(Fig. 2A). Both chemokines were also potently induced in the
serum of IL-10 treated, tumor-bearing animals (Fig. 2B).

Cancer Res; 72(14) July 15, 2012

Therefore, we asked if chemokine–mediated T-cell migration could be responsible for the antitumor efﬁcacy of IL-10.
Mice deﬁcient for the MIG and IP-10 receptor (CXCR3/)
bearing large PDV6 tumors were treated with IL-10. IL-10
treatment induced rejection of tumors in CXCR3/ mice
with an identical kinetic as in WT mice (Fig. 2C), indicating
that CXCR3 is not essential or even rate limiting for IL-10–
mediated tumor rejection.
Because chemokine receptor usage typically shows some
redundancy, T-cell migration was blocked using a more
general approach. To this end we used FTY720, an analog
of sphingosine-1-phosphate that blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs (23). First, we veriﬁed that
FTY720 inhibits the migration of newly activated CD8þ T
cells from the lymph node to the tumor. CFSE-labeled OT-I
CD8þ T cells, expressing a TCR speciﬁc for the Ovalbuminderived peptide SIINFEKL bound to H-2Kb, were adoptively
transferred into mice with established PDV6-OVA tumors.
One day later, FTY720 treatment was started to analyzed the
proliferation and accumulation of OT-I cells in the LN and
the tumor (Fig. 3A). OT-I cells in the LN of control and
FTY720–treated mice had proliferated to an equal extent 3
days after transfer and the frequency of OT-I cells was
identical. Only very few OT-I cells were detected in tumors
3 days after transfer (data not shown). Seven days after the

transfer a high frequency of OT-I cells was found in the
tumors of control mice, but not of FTY720 treated mice,
indicating complete inhibition of CD8þ T-cell migration
from the lymph node to the tumor (Fig. 3B).
We next determined the effect of FTY720 treatment on IL10–mediated tumor rejection.
Mice with established PDV6 tumors were injected 3 times a
week with FTY720 starting 3 days before minicircle injection.
The efﬁcacy of FTY720 was conﬁrmed by analysis of the T-cell
numbers in the blood (Fig. 3C). The frequency of CD8þ T cells
in control mice that had not received FTY720 was on average
10% of total PBMC. The frequency of CD8 T cells in the blood of
IL-10–treated mice was initially comparable, but was reduced
after prolonged exposure to IL-10. In FTY720-treated mice, the
frequency of CD8þ T cells in the blood of was reduced to
around 1% irrespective of IL-10 treatment showing that
FTY720 inhibits T-cell egress from lymphoid organs even under
IL-10 treatment.
However, the blockade of T-cell migration by FTY720 did not
alter the antitumor efﬁcacy (Fig. 3D). IL-10 induced rejection of
established PDV6 tumors followed a similar kinetic in both
buffer and FTY720 treated mice. Identical results were
obtained in CT-26 tumor bearing Balb/C mice (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Despite inhibition of de novo T-cell inﬁltration, IL-10
treatment increased the activity of tumor-resident CD8þ T
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D).
These results show that IL-10 does not require the involvement of LN CD8þ T cells but rather directly activates tumorresident CD8þ T cells.

Activated CD8þ T cells express elevated levels of IL-10Ra
To determine the mechanism underlying this differential
behavior of LN and tumor-derived CD8þ T cells, we analyzed
the IL-10 receptor expression on these cells (Fig. 4A). Indeed,
tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells expressed signiﬁcantly higher
levels of the IL-10 receptor than CD8þ T cells from the TDLN.
CD4þ TILs also showed a higher expression of the IL-10
receptor compared with their LN counterparts; however, the
levels were lower than on CD8þ TILs, especially for effector
CD4þFoxp3 TILs. NK cells and CD11bþ cells from the tumor
expressed similar or slightly reduced IL-10 receptor levels
when compared with the corresponding lymph node
population.
We next addressed the question why CD8þ TILs express
more IL-10 receptor than their lymph node counterparts.
Although CD8þ T cells in the lymph node mostly consist of
na€ve T cells, tumor-inﬁltrating T cells must have been
previously activated to allow for migration to the tumor.
Therefore, the control of IL-10 receptor expression on CD8þ
T cells in response to antigen speciﬁc stimulation was
assessed. Splenocytes from OT-I TCR transgenic mice were
stimulated with SIINFEKL peptide in vitro and IL-10 receptor surface expression on CD8þ T cells was analyzed. Indeed,
activated CD8þ OT-I T cells expressed substantially
increased levels of the IL-10 receptor when compared with
na€ve OT-I cells (Fig. 4B). To conﬁrm that activated T cells
also increase the expression of IL-10 receptor in vivo, we
transferred CD45.1þ CD8þ OT-I T cells into congenic
CD45.2þ/þ C57BL/6 mice with established PDV6-OVA

the TDLN had undetectable IL-10Ra surface levels. In contrast, OT-I cells in the lymph node expressed elevated levels
of IL-10Ra on their surface (Fig. 4C). The IL-10 receptor
expression was maintained on OT-I cells isolated from the
tumor. Host CD8þ T cells from the tumor also showed
strong IL-10Ra expression in agreement with previous data
(Fig. 4A and C). Together, these data show that antigenmediated activation of CD8þ T cells leads to increased
expression of the IL-10 receptor.

IL-10R expression on CD8þ T cells is necessary and
sufﬁcient for CD8þ T-cell activation by IL-10
The high level of IL-10 receptor expression on tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells, regulatory CD4þ T cells, and myeloid cells
(Fig. 4A) led us to wonder which population might contribute
to the observed activation and expansion of CD8þ T cells. To
answer this question, we used an adoptive transfer of WT and

splenocytes from OT-I TCR Tg mice were stimulated with 1 mg/mL

analyzed for the surface expression of IL-10Ra. C, splenocytes from
CD45.1þ OT-I mice containing 1.9  106 CD8þ T cells were adoptively
transferred into PDV6-OVA–bearing C57BL/6 mice. Nine days later, the

or TDLNs was analyzed. Data are from 1 of at least 2 independent
experiments consisting of 2 to 3 mice per group with similar results.

established PDV6-OVA tumors (Fig. 5A and B). One week after
the T-cell transfer, mice either received the IL-10 or control
minicircle. Five days later, we determined the frequency of
activated CD8þ T cells by ﬂow cytometry for intracellular IFNg,
because IFNg expression is essential for IL-10–mediated PDV6
tumor rejection (12).
As shown above for CD8þ T cells inﬁltrating CT26 tumors
(Fig. 1C), the frequency of IFNg producing host CD8þ T cells
inﬁltrating PDV6-OVA tumors was increased on average 3-fold
after IL-10 treatment (Fig. 5C). In the tumors of control treated
mice, a similar percentage of WT and IL-10 receptor deﬁcient

OT-I T cells expressed IFNg (Fig. 5D). After IL-10 treatment, the
frequency of IFNg producing WT cells in the tumor increased
approximately 3-fold, whereas the frequency of IFNg producing IL-10Rb/ OT-I cells stayed constant (Fig. 5D). The
frequency of IFNg producing host CD8þ T cells, WT, and IL10 receptor deﬁcient OT-I T cells in the TDLN was low, but
identical, irrespective of the presence or absence of IL-10 (data
not shown).
These results show that the expression of the IL-10
receptor on tumor-resident CD8þ T cells is necessary for
the induction of IFNg after IL-10 treatment. We next asked,
if other cells in the microenvironment were required to
receive the IL-10 signal or if IL-10R expression on CD8þ
T cells alone might be sufﬁcient for their activation. We
used IL-10Rb/ recipients for the adoptive cotransfer of
WT and IL-10Rb/ OT-I CD8þ T cells. In this scenario, only
the WT OT-I cells expressed the IL-10 receptor. In contrast
to WT hosts, the frequency of IFNg producing host CD8þ
T cells inﬁltrating PDV6-OVA tumors was not increased in
IL-10Rb/ hosts after IL-10 treatment (Fig. 5E). However,
the frequency of IFNg producing tumor-resident WT OT-I
cells increased again by approximately 3-fold after IL-10
treatment (Fig. 5F).
These results show that the expression of the IL-10 receptor
is only required on tumor-resident CD8þ T cells, to mediate the
accumulation of activated, IFNg expressing intratumoral
CD8þ T cells in response to IL-10.
IL-10Rb expression is required on endogenous CD8þ T
cells for activation and IFNg induction by IL-10
T-cell receptor transgenes may have a comparatively
high afﬁnity to their cognate antigen and the antigen is
more prominently expressed than endogenous tumor antigens. To investigate a natural afﬁnity range of antigen TCR
pairings, mixed bone marrow chimeras were established
with WT (CD45.2þ/þ) and IL-10 receptor deﬁcient
(CD45.1þ/þ) bone marrow. Three months after the transfer,
MC38 tumors were implanted. Mice with established
tumors were injected with the IL-10 minicircle and intracellular IFNg was measured by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 6A and
B). In tumors from control mice, around 4% of both WT
and IL-10Rb/ CD8þ T cells expressed IFNg (Fig. 6C). In
contrast, 10% to 20% of WT CD8þ T cells in tumors of mice
treated with the IL-10 minicircle expressed IFNg, whereas
the frequency of IFNg producing IL-10Rb/ CD8þ T cells
was not increased.
Taken together, these results show that IL-10 directly activates tumor-resident CD8þ T cells to express IFNg.
IL-10 treatment leads to the preferred accumulation of
WT CD8þ T cells in the tumor
T cells and in particular CD8þ T cells are usually rare in
tumors but their increased presence confers favorable prognosis to patients with tumor (24). We used mixed bone marrow
chimeras to investigate if the IL-10R status would change CD8þ
T cells presence in tumors in dependence of treatment.
In control mice, both WT and IL-10Rb/ CD8þ T cells were
present in lymph nodes and tumors at equal numbers (Fig. 6D).

mice were cotransferred at a 1:1 ratio into PDV6-OVA–bearing CD45.1/ C57BL/6 mice. Eight days later, mice were injected with 5 mg control or IL-10

The ratio of WT to IL-10Rb/ CD8þ T cells in the TDLN
remained similar upon IL-10 treatment, even if IL-10Rb/
cells appeared to be at a slight disadvantage in later stages
of IL-10 exposure (Fig. 6E). Surprisingly however, IL-10 treatment not only lead to a strong increase in IFNg producing
WT tumor-resident CD8þ T cells (Fig. 5B) but also to a
preferred accumulation of WT tumor-resident CD8þ T cells
over IL-10Rb/ cells. In the mixed bone marrow chimeras,
the frequency of WT CD8þ T cells in the tumors of IL10–treated mice was increased from 60% to 90% of all
CD8þ T cells with prolonged presence of IL-10. WT CD4þ
T cells also accumulated over IL-10Rb/ CD4þ cells in the
tumor but only after prolonged elevation of IL-10 and
the differences were less pronounced than for CD8þ T cells
(Fig. 6H and I).

IL-10R induces accumulation of antigen-speciﬁc tumorresident CD8þ T cells
To conﬁrm the preferred accumulation of WT CD8þ
T cells in IL-10–treated tumors, we analyzed the behavior of WT and IL10Rb/ OT-I CD8þ T cells after
cotransfer into mice carrying large ovalbumin expressing
tumors. In control treated mice, both T-cell genotypes
were present at an equal proportion in the TDLN and
the tumor (Fig. 7A–C). In IL-10 treated animals, tumorresident IL-10R proﬁcient cells had again an advantage
over IL-10Rb/ OT-I CD8þ T cells, whereas the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant in the lymph node
(Fig. 7A–C).
A similar effect was also observed in IL-10Rb/ hosts,
indicating the requirement of the IL-10 signaling in only the

CD8þ T cells (Fig. 7D). The increased accumulation of tumorresident CD8þ T cells in response to IL-10 is therefore dependent on direct activation of the IL-10R on the CD8þ T cell,
rather than an effect on macrophages, dendritic cells, or CD4þ
helper cells.
It was unclear how the accumulation of tumor-resident WT
over IL-10Rb/ CD8þ T cells is regulated. To start elucidating

cells was more pronounced in the tumor than in the TDLN
(Fig. 7E and F).
This result suggests that tumor-resident CD8þ T cells proliferate in vivo in response to IL-10 treatment and that this
effect is primarily induced directly in CD8þ T cells.
IL-10 activates a unique combination of STATs in tumorresident CD8þ T cells
To explain why CD8þ T cells from lymph nodes react
different to IL-10 than tumor-resident CD8 T cells, we asked
if the higher expression of the IL-10R on tumor-resident
CD8þ T cells would result in a differential signaling downstream of the receptor. To this end, we conducted ﬂow
cytometry for phosphorylated STATs (p-STAT) in T cells.
Both in CD8þ T cells isolated from the TDLN and the tumor
IL-10 induced pSTAT3 (Fig. 7G). However, the levels of
pSTAT3 were almost 10 fold higher in tumor-derived CD8þ
T cells than in TDLN-derived CD8þ T cells. Tumor-resident
CD8þ T cells also had higher levels of pSTAT3 than CD4þ
TILs in response to IL-10, whereas LN CD8þ and CD4þ T
cells displayed similar amounts of pSTAT3. Interestingly, IL10 signaling also led to the activation of STAT1 but only in
tumor-derived CD8þ T cells (Fig. 7G). IL-10 did not activate
STAT1 in CD8þ T cells obtained from the TDLN nor in CD4þ
T cells isolated from the LN or tumor. This data suggest that
the high expression of the IL-10 receptor on tumor-resident
CD8þ T cells leads to a unique activation pattern of STAT3
and STAT1 in these cells.

Discussion
IL-10 is generally considered an immune suppressive cytokine and is often cited as one of the molecules responsible for
the immune-suppressive environment in tumors. In contrast
to this widely held believe, and conﬁrming earlier studies (11–
13), we show here that IL-10 induces potent antitumor
responses. This antitumor activity required the presence of
CD8þ T cells and IL-10 increased the cytotoxic activity of these
cells. We show here, for the ﬁrst time, that in vivo treatment
with IL-10 directly induces speciﬁc activation and expansion of
tumor-resident CD8þ T cells. In human tumors, the number
and the activity of intratumoral CD8þ T cells correlates with an
improved prognosis for patients with cancer (25). High frequency of tumor-speciﬁc T cells in the blood, as can be
achieved with cancer vaccines, does not necessarily correlate
with improved prognosis (26, 27). Restricted migration of T
cells into the tumor can explain why vaccine induced increases
in tumor-speciﬁc T cells have not translated into effective
clinical outcomes (28). Interestingly, IL-10 treatment seems to
circumvent this problem as T-cell trafﬁcking from lymphoid
organs is not required for T-cell activation in established
tumors. Inhibition of T-cell trafﬁcking with FY720 does not
prevent IL-10 induced tumor rejection or the activation of
tumor-resident CD8þ T cells. Our data therefore suggest that
IL-10 treatment does not require de novo priming of tumorreactive CD8þ T cells in the draining lymph node, but that
reactivation of tumor-resident CD8þ T cells can be sufﬁcient to
reject tumors.

www.aacrjournals.org

It is important to note that tertiary lymphoid structures as
described in human colon and lung cancers were not found in
any of the tumors analyzed in this study and a previous study
(12), CD8þ T cells were rather equally distributed throughout
the tumor tissue.
The potent antitumor efﬁcacy of IL-10 is in stark contrast to
its better known immune suppressive capacity in infection and
autoimmune models as well as its described contribution to
the immune suppressive environment of the tumor.
The stage and location of the immune response as well as the
IL-10 target cell driving the immune response at this stage
seem to most affect the immunoregulatory function of IL-10.
The inhibitory function of IL-10 on T-cell responses is most
prominent during the priming phase of the immune response.
Here, IL-10 mainly inhibits the function of DCs and macrophages, limiting the initial activation of T cells. Moreover, IL-10
can also directly affect CD4þ T cells, inhibiting their activation,
proliferation, and cytokine production. In contrast, IL-10 stimulates CD8þ T cells in vitro (14–17). However, in a recent
study addressing the impact of IL-10 on CD8þ T cells in vivo, it
was shown that IL-10 can inhibit pathogen-speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells directly (29). In this study, WT- and IL-10Rb–deﬁcient OTI CD8þ T cells were cotransferred into mice 24 hours after
infection with ovalbumin expressing Listeria monocytogenes,
when infection induced IL-10 serum levels are highest, and
na€ve WT CD8þ T cells in the spleen were limited in their
expansion. Therefore, IL-10 inhibits the priming and early
activation of the transferred CD8þ T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. In our adoptive transfer experiments, IL-10
treatment started after the OT-I transfer, when cells had
extensively proliferated and migrated into the tumor. Here,
in contrast to na€ve CD8þ T cells, IL-10 does not inhibit, but
potently stimulates activated, tumor-resident CD8þ T cells.
Underlying this different outcome of IL-10 treatment on
CD8þ T-cell activity might be the levels of IL-10R expression
in na€ve versus activated cells. Tumor-resident CD8þ T cells
express higher levels of IL-10R, leading to a different signaling
downstream of the receptor than in their na€ve lymph node
counterparts. Although lymph-node–derived T cells show
intermediate levels of pSTAT3, tumor-derived CD8þ T cells
show high levels of activated pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 in response
to IL-10. In many cell types, STAT3 and STAT1 have opposing
roles in the control of proliferation and the regulation of
immune response. STAT3 can promote proliferation and survival. In contrast, STAT1 signaling promotes immune
responses, but can induce proapoptotic and antiproliferative
pathways (30). The role of these transcription factors in the IL10 induced activation of tumor-resident CD8þ T cells has not
been addressed. Interestingly, IL-21 and IL-27, two cytokines
that show antitumor efﬁcacy (31, 32), likewise induce preferentially pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 (33, 34) indicating that this
combined activation of STATs in CD8þ T cells might be
especially beneﬁcial for the induction of productive antitumor
immune responses.
In summary, we have shown here that therapeutic IL-10
treatment leads to the direct activation of tumor-resident
CD8þ T cells and has potent antitumor efﬁcacy in several
mouse tumor models. This data, together with the ﬁnding that
