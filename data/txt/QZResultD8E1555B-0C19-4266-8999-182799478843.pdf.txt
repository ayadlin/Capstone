ABSTRACT
Background: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine, which is involved in
the regulation of differentiation and growth of certain types of tumor cells. Constitutive
activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) induced by
IL-6 is frequently detected in liver cancer and has emerged as a viable molecular
target for liver cancer treatment. However, few inhibitors targeting up-streams of
STAT3 are available for the therapy of liver cancer. We reported the discovery of
EVISTA (Raloxifene HCl) as novel inhibitor of IL-6/GP130 protein-protein interactions
(PPIs) using multiple ligand simultaneous docking (MLSD) and drug repositioning. The
possible effect of Raloxifene in STAT3 signaling or liver cancer cells is still unclear.
Results: Raloxifene inhibited the P-STAT3 stimulated by IL-6, but not the
induction of STAT1 and STAT6 phosphorylation by IFN-γ, IFN-α, and IL-4. Raloxifene
inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and resulted in the induction apoptosis on human
liver cancer cell-lines. Raloxifene inhibited the targets of STAT3, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl
and survivin and cell viability, cell migration, and colony formation in liver cancer
cells. Further, daily administration of Raloxifene suppressed the Hep-G2 tumor growth
in mice in vivo.
Materials and Methods: The inhibitory effect on STAT3 phosphorylation and
activity as well as cell viability, migration, and colony forming ability by Raloxifene
was examined in human liver cancer cells. Tumor growth was detected via mouse
xenograft tumor mode.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that Raloxifene is a potent IL-6/GP130 inhibitor
and may be a chemoprevention agent for liver cancer by targeting persistent STAT3
signaling.

INTRODUCTION

cancer. HCC accounts for more than 85% of all primary
liver cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of 9% and a
median survival time of less than 1 year. Recent data
indicates that the mortality of HCC in China has been
increasing, severely threatening the health and lives of

common cause of cancer mortality worldwide and is the
second cause of death from malignancy, following lung

people [1]. The large number of cases and poor survival
rates under current therapies necessitates the search for
novel target therapies for HCC.
As transcription factors, signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) proteins participate in
relaying signals from cytokines and growth factors [2–4].
STAT3 has been found to contribute to oncogenesis
including liver cancer [2, 5]. After activated, STAT3
translocates to nucleus, resulting in DNA binding and
multiple oncogene transcription, which leads to cell
proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, host immune
evasion and resistance to apoptosis [6–9]. One of the
cytokines that is able to induce STAT3 phosphorylation
is interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 binds to IL-6 receptor-α
(IL-6Rα) to form a binary complex and then recruits
GP130 to form the IL-6/IL-6Rα/GP130 heterotrimer.
Further, homodimerization of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/GP130
heterotrimers occurs by interactions between IL-6 site
III of one trimer and the D1 domain of GP130 of the
other trimer, forming a hexamer [10–11]. The reciprocal
homodimerization of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/GP130 trimers
triggers a signaling cascade of phosphorylation of Janus
kinases (JAKs) and a downstream effector STAT3,
followed by reciprocal dimerization of the Tyr705phosphorylated STAT3. Therefore, it is the key step for
the formation of hexamer and cancer cell proliferation
and migration that IL-6 binds to GP130. Thus,
interference with STAT3 signaling pathway in cancer
cells such as by antisense oligonucleotides and dominantnegative STAT3 mutants, has been shown to result in
growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis [12–14].
As the up-stream of STAT3, inhibition the binding
of IL-6 and GP130 may also exhibit potent growthsuppressive activity in liver cancer cells. However, it
will take a long time to develop new drug aiming at the
binding of IL-6 and GP130. Thus, it is necessary to find
new use of old drug.

As a microbial metabolite, Madindoline A (MDL-A)
was reported to selectively inhibit GP130, resulting in
STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition [15]. With the model
of MDL-A, using a novel computational strategy for
fragment-based drug design by combining multiple ligand
simultaneous docking (MLSD) and drug repositioning,
we demonstrated that Raloxifene exhibited a new
function against IL-6/GP130 protein-protein interface
in our previous study [16]. Although it is reported that
Raloxifene inhibited constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation
in pancreatic cancer cell and breast cancer cell-lines,
whether it is efficient for Raloxifene to inhibit IL-6/
GP130/STAT3 signaling in liver cancer cells and suppress
tumor growth in vitro and in vivo is still unknown.

RESULTS
Inhibition of IL-6 mediated induction of STAT3
phosphorylation in Hep-3B liver cancer cell-line
Previous studies have shown that Raloxifene
had the potential to inhibit the combination of IL-6 and
GP130 by multiple ligand simultaneous docking and drug
repositioning technology according to the structure of
MDL-A (Figure 1A). Studies have shown that Raloxifene
selectively inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT3 induced
by IL-6 in PANC-1 cancer cell-line [16]. To confirm
whether Raloxifene has the potential of growth-suppressive
in liver cancer, we first examined the effect of Raloxifene
on constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation induced by IL-6
in Hep-3B liver cancer cells. With the pretreatment of
Raloxifene for 2 hours and IL-6 added for another 30 min,
we examined the expression of STAT3 phosphorylation on
tyrosine 705 in Hep-3B. Our results showed that Raloxifene
inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by IL-6 in
a dose-dependent manner and had no effect on the overall
expression of STAT3 (Figure 1B).

Effect of raloxifene on the phosphorylation of
STAT3 induced by LIF and STAT1 and STAT6
induced by IFN-γ, IFN-α and IL-4

which elevates the levels of STAT3 phosphorylation, were
treated with Raloxifene (50, 75 μM) for 24 hours. Western
blot analysis showed that Raloxifene inhibited persistent
STAT3 phosphorylation. We also examined the expression
of STAT3 target genes, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and survivin
in liver cancer cells by western blot. With the treatment of
Raloxifene for 24 hours, the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl,
and survivin was reduced in Hep-G2 (Figure 3A), 7721
(Figure 3B), and Huh-7 (Figure 3C) liver cancer cell-lines.

We also examined STAT3 phosphorylation on
tyrosine 705 induced by LIF, STAT1 phosphorylation
on tyrosine 701 induced by IFN-γ or IFN-α, and STAT6
on tyrosine 641 induced by IL-4 in Hep-3B liver caner
cell-line. Our results showed that Raloxifene did not
inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by LIF
(Figure 2A), or affect the level of STAT1 phosphorylation
induced by IFN-γ (Figure 2B) and IFN-α (Figure 2C),
and had no effect on STAT6 phosphorylation induced by
IL-4 (Figure 2D) in Hep-3B liver cancer cells. The results
indicated that Raloxifene specifically inhibited STAT3
phosphorylation induced by IL-6 significantly, but had no
effect with other STATs induced by different cytokines.

Raloxifene inhibited cell viability and colony
forming capacity
As IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling is essential for
cell viability and colony formation in liver cancer cells,
we examined cell viability by MTT assay. Treatment
with Raloxifene (50, 60, 75 μM) for 24 hours resulted in
a dramatic decrease of cell viability in a dose-dependent
manner in Hep-G2 (Figure 4A), 7721 (Figure 4B) and
Huh-7 (Figure 4C) cancer cells. The IC50 values for
Raloxifene were 50.488 to 53.858 μM in liver cancer cells.
In addition, we investigated the effect of Raloxifene on
cell viability of LO2 liver cell line, which showed that
Raloxifene proved weak inhibition effect on normal liver
cells (Figure 4D).

Effect of raloxifene on persistent STAT3
phosphorylation and the downstream target
genes of STAT3 in liver cancer cell lines
To detect the inhibitory effect of Raloxifene on
persistent STAT3 phosphorylation, Hep-G2 (Figure 3A),
7721 (Figure 3B) and Huh-7 (Figure 3C) cancer cell-lines,

Figure 2: Raloxifene did not affect the phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705 or other STATs induced by other cytokines.

Raloxifene did not inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705 induced by (A) LIF, did not inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT1 on
Tyr701 induced by IFN-γ (B) and IFN-α (C), and did not inhibit STAT6 phosphorylation on Tyr641 induced by IL-4 (D) in Hep-3B liver
cancer cells. With pretreated with Raloxifene for 2 h followed by cytokines inducing for another 30 min, western blot was used to evaluate
the phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT1 and STAT6.

We also examined the efficacy of Raloxifene in
inhibiting the proliferation and regeneration potential of
cancer cells. The results demonstrated that Raloxifene
remarkably inhibited colony forming capacity of 7721 and
Huh-7 liver cancer cells (Figure 4E).

phosphorylation by Raloxifene in liver cancer cells by
blocking nuclear translocation.

Raloxifene inhibited cell migration in Huh-7
liver cancer cells

To examine the effect of Raloxifene on cell apoptosis,
cleaved caspase-3 that indicated cell apoptosis was tested
after treatment with Raloxifene for 24 hours by western blot
in Hep-G2, 7721 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells (Figure 6A).
The results showed that Raloxifene induced cell apoptosis
by up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3. Further, we
investigated the distribution of phosphatidylserine in cell
membrane with the treatment of Raloxifene for 6 hours
using Annexin V-FITC staining by flow cytometry assay.
Our results showed that phospharidylserine turned insideout with the treatment of Raloxifene (50, 75 μM) in 7721
cancer cells, which indicated cell apoptosis (Figure 6B).
Further more, we explored the effect of Raloxifene
on 7721 cancer cells after siRNA-STAT3 transfection. After
siRNA-STAT3 transfection, the expression and activation
level of STAT3 in 7721 cells were down regulated
(Figure 6C). After Raloxifene added for 24 hours, cleaved
caspase-3 was detected by western blot assay. Compared
with vector group, Raloxifene had no effect on cell
apoptosis, which indicated Raloxifene inhibited cell growth
by targeting IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling (Figure 6C).

Raloxifene induced cell apoptosis in liver cancer
cells

STAT3 has been shown to be involved in wound
healing and cell migration of cancer cells, which might
lead to invasion and metastasis. We evaluated the effect of
Raloxifene on cell migration in Huh-7 liver cancer cells by
wound healing assay. Our results indicated that Raloxifene
could suppress cell migration in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4F).

Raloxifene inhibited STAT3 nuclear
translocation in liver cancer cells
As a transcription factor, the translocation of STAT3
from cytoplasm to nucleus is very important. So we
detected the effect of Raloxifene on STAT3 translocation in
Hep-3B liver cancer cells. Cells were cultured in serum-free
medium for 8 hours to make STAT3 locate in the cytoplasm.
With the pretreatment of Raloxifene for 2 hours, IL-6 was
added to induce for 30 min. Then the immunoﬂuorescence
staining assay was used to evaluate the translocation of
STAT3. Our results showed that STAT3 was phosphorylated
and translocated into the nucleus with the induction of
50 ng/ml IL-6. While with the pretreatment of Raloxifene,
STAT3 was still located in cytoplasm (Figure 5). These
findings demonstrated that STAT3 transcriptional function
was impaired via the consequent suppression of STAT3

Raloxifene suppressed tumor growth of liver
cancer cells in mouse model in vivo
We further tested the suppression effect of
Raloxifene on tumor growth in nude mice xenograft
models in vivo. The mice were randomly divided into two

Figure 3: Raloxifene inhibited constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation and the target genes of STAT3 in liver cancer cell

blot. The results indicated that P-STAT3 was inhibited by Raloxifene in Hep-G2 (A), 7721 (B) and Huh-7 (C) liver cancer cells. The
downstream targets of STAT3 were also down regulated by Raloxifene.

groups. Compared with vehicle-treated controls, the tumor
volume (Figure 7A, 7C) and weight (Figure 7B) of mice
treated with Raloxifene was significantly decreased. STAT3
phosphorylation of tumor tissue samples from these mice
was also decreased by Raloxifene, suggesting inhibition
in STAT3 phosphorylation resulting in the suppression of
tumor growth in mice. Further, the cleavage of caspase-3
was tested by western blot, and the results showed that
Raloxifene induced caspase-3 cleavage in xenograft
(Figure 7D). IHC staining showed that Raloxifene inhibited
STAT3 phosphorylation and Bcl-2 compared with control
group. Further more, Raloxifene induced caspase-3
cleavage in rumor tissues (Figure 7E).
To further evaluate whether Raloxifene could reach
an effective concentration in vivo with a dose of 15 mg/kg,
another experiment was designed. Raloxifene (15 mg/kg)
was orally administrated to nude mice for 24 hours
pretreatment, and IL-6 (50 μg/kg) was given via peritoneal
injection for 2 hours. Phosphorylation level of STAT3 in
liver tissues was detected. Raloxifene inhibited STAT3

activation induced by IL-6 (Figure 7F), which induced
Raoxifene at 15 mg/kg dose could reach an effective
concentration in vivo.

DISCUSSION
It is well known that cytokines not only
contribute to hemeostasis via immune responses and
biological defense, but they are also involved in cancer,
inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune diseases. IL-6
is a major cytokine in inflammation and oncogenesis. It
has been reported that excess IL-6 production is closely
associated with cancer cachexia [17] and inflammation
hepatocellular adenoma [18]. It has been reported
that circulating IL-6 is a risk indicator and is strongly
correlated with adverse prognosis in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). The development of HCC depends
on paracrine IL-6 production by inflammatory cells
and acquired autocrine IL-6 signaling [19–20]. One of
the most important downstream target genes of IL-6 is

Figure 4: Raloxifene inhibited the viability of liver cancer cells. MTT assay showed that the viability of liver cancer cells was

inhibited with the treatment of Raloxifene for 24 h in Hep-G2 (A), 7721 (B), and Huh-7 (C). However, Raloxifene did not significantly
inhibit the cell viability of LO2, which is a normal hepatocyte cell line (D). Raloxifene inhibited colony formation in Huh-7 and 7721 liver
cancer cells (E). Cells colony formation ability was investigated after treatment with Raloxifene for 4 h. The results showed that Raloxifene
suppressed the proliferation and regeneration ability of Huh-7 and 7721 cancer cells. Raloxifene inhibited cell migration in Huh-7 cancer
cells (F). With Raloxifene treatment for 4 h, wound-healing assay was used to test the migration ability of Huh-7 cancer cells. Raloxifene
inhibited cell migration with the concentration of 50 and 75 μM.

STAT3, which is constitutively activated in various types
of cancer, including liver cancer. STAT3 activation results
in the expression of downstream genes that promote cell
proliferation and provide resistance to apoptosis, such
as cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl respectively [3, 5, 8, 21].
Consequently, for clinical application, development of
a small molecular antagonist targeting to IL-6/GP130 is
anticipated because of superiority in therapeutic effect,
oral absorbency, and antigenicity.
A lot of novel small molecular inhibitors of STAT3
have been reported to suppress cancer cells and tumor
growth, such as LLL12 [22], LY5 [23], XZH-5 [24] and
so on. However, to date, the translation of anti-STAT3
therapies into clinical trials has been difficult [25–26].
Further, few of IL-6/GP130 inhibitors are efficient in
suppressing tumor growth. The purpose of the present
work was to search for new anti-IL-6 therapies that apply
to clinical trails.
As we descripted in previous section, Madindoline
A (MDL-A) was reported to selectively inhibit GP130,
resulting in STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition [15].
However, MDL-A is a natural microbial metabolite, which
is no longer available from natural resources, and its

binding to GP130 is relatively weak. Until now, there is no
any other reported IL-6/IL-6R/GP130 antagonist. With the
model of MDL-A, We found that Raloxifene exhibited a
new function against IL-6/GP130 protein-protein interface
using a novel computational strategy for fragment-based
drug design by combining multiple ligand simultaneous
docking (MLSD) and drug repositioning in our previous
study [16].
Approved by Food Drug Administration (FDA),
Raloxifene primarily targets the human estrogen receptors
(ER), which involve estrogenic actions on bone but
antiestrogenic actions on uterus and breast [27]. They
are used in the prevention of osteoporosis. Our previous
study showed that Raloxifene selectively inhibits STAT3
phosphorylation induced by IL-6 in the GP130/JAK/
STAT3 signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cell-lines
(PANC-1) that express GP130, but not ER [16]. Compared
with other IL-6/GP130/STAT3 inhibitors which have not
used for clinical therapy, Raloxifene has advantages in
terms of oral absorbency, security, and stability. So, in
this study, we further investigated whether Raloxifene has
the ability to inhibit IL-6/GP130/ STAT3 signaling and
suppress tumor growth in liver cancer cells.

Our results showed that Raloxifene inhibited STAT3
phosphorylation induced by IL-6, but not by LIF in Hep-3B
liver cancer cells. The reason we chose Hep-3B for
this study is that the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in
Hep-3B liver cancer cells is low. Further, we tested the
effect of Raloxifene on STAT1 phosphorylation induced
by IFN-γ and IFN-α and P-STAT6 induced by IL-4. The
results showed that Raloxifene did not affect other STATs,
which indicated that Raloxifene specifically inhibits
IL-6 and GP130 binding. As the downstream of IL-6/
GP130, phosphorylation of STAT3, as well as STAT3
downstream target genes, were inhibited by Raloxifene in
Hep-G2, Huh-7 and 7721 cancer cell-lines. The inhibitory
effects of Raloxifene for STAT3 downstream target genes
result in an inhibition of cell viability, the induction of

apoptosis, inhibition of colony forming ability and
cell migration. Furthermore, Raloxifene demonstrated
significant inhibition of tumor growth from Hep-G2 mice
tumor xenografts via oral administration, which is more
close to physiological serum concentration. The fact that
Raloxifene hinder Hep-G2 tumor growth and reduce tumor
mass in vivo suggests a potential therapeutic application.
Raloxifene is a suitable agent for targeting liver
cancer and possibly certain type of cancer cells with
constitutively activated STAT3 induced by IL-6, due to
its ability to inhibit IL-6/GP130 binding as well as their
potent growth suppressive activity both in vitro and
in vivo. Moreover, as an approved drug by FDA, the
security and permeability of Raloxifene are superior as
compared to other reported novel molecular inhibitors of

Figure 6: Raloxifene induced cell apoptosis of liver cancer cells. With Raloxifene treatment for 24 h, the cleaved caspase-3
was tested by western blot. Raloxifene induced caspase-3 cleavage in Hep-G2, 7721, and Huh-7 (A), which indicated cell apoptosis. The
Annexin V-FITC staining was used to test the distribution of phosphatidylserine, which is also used to indicate cell apoptosis (B). 7721 liver
cancer cells was transfected with siRNA-STAT3 to knock down the expression of STAT3, and then the expression of P-STAT3 was also
decreased. Raloxifene was added for another 24 hours and cleaved caspase-3 was detected by Western Blot. Raloxifene did not induce the
cleavage of Caspase-3 when STAT3 was knocked down by siRNA-STAT3 transfection (C).

IL-6/GP130/STAT3, such as MDL-A [15], LLL12 [23],
LY5 [24], and XZH-5 [25]. Therefore, Raloxifene is
more likely to apply to clinical trails. Further, our study
provided experimental basis for the expansion of clinical
indications of marketed drug.

Figure 7: Raloxifene suppressed tumor growth of liver cancer cells in vivo. Raloxifene decreased cell volume compared

with vehicle group. The next day after Hep-G2 cancer cells injected, the mice were randomized to give daily oral dosages of 15 mg/kg of
Raloxifene or vehicle control for 19 days and tumor volumes were determined every other day (A). After tumors harvested, weighed every
tumor by electronic scale (B) and determined the volumes of tumors (C). Raloxifene inhibited P-STAT3 but not total STAT3, and induced
caspase-3 cleavage in mouse xenografts in vivo (D). Raloxifene also inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, decreased the expression of Bcl-2
and induced apoptosis as shown by IHC staining (E). Raloxifene (15 mg/kg) pretreated for 24 hours and IL-6 injected for another 2 hours
in nude mice, then P-STAT3 of liver tissues was detected by western blot (F). Raloxifene suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 induced
by IL-6 in liver tissues of nude mice, which indicated Raloxifene could inhibited IL-6/STAT3 signaling in vivo with one dose of 15 mg/kg.

(Molecule Probe, Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature
shielded from light, and then washed with PBST. Cells
were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to stain nuclei,
washed twice with PBST, and observed using an inverted
fluorescence microscope.

Western blot analysis
Cancer cells were treated with different
concentrations of Raloxifene (50, 75 μmo/L) or DMSO
for 24 h. For interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-4 (IL-4),
IFN-γ, IFN-α and LIF treatments, Hep-3B liver cancer
cell were pretreated with Raloxifene (50, 75 μmo/L) or
DMSO for 2 h and IL-6, IL-4, IFN-γ, IFN-α or LIF (Pepro
Tech) were then added for 30 minutes before cells were
collected. The collected cells were washed with cold PBS
and lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1%
deoxycholate, 0.1%SDS) containing protease inhibitors
(1 mM PMSF) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM),
then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies (Cell
signaling Tech) against phospho-specific STAT3 (Tyrosine
705) (P-STAT3, Y705), STAT1 (Tyrosine 701) (P-STAT1,
Y701), STAT6 (Tyrosine 641) (P-STAT6, Y641), ERK1/2
(Threonine 202/Tyrosine 204) (P-ERK, T202/Y204),
cleaved caspase-3, STAT3, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, survivin
and GAPDH were used for western blot. Then HRPconjugated secondary antibodies purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology were used. The specific proteins were
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
Western Blotting kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Wound healing assay
Huh-7 cell-line were plated in a 6-well plate (with
three lines at the external bottom of each well) and
incubated in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 overnight
to form a confluent monolayer. The monolayers were
scratched by a plastic tip vertically to the lines and washed
by PBS to remove cell debris. Then the cells were treated
with varying concentrations of Raloxifene (50, 75 μM) or
DMSO for 4 h. Photos of wound closure were taken at
the crossing point of lines and scratches every 12 h by the
inverted microscope until the wound treated with DMSO
was completely closed. Then the distance of wound
closure was measured by Photoshop 8.0 software.

Transfection
7721 liver cancer cells (3 × 105) were cultured in
6-well plates, and transfection with STAT3 siRNA or
empty vector using lipofectamine 2000 following the
manufacture’s instruction (Invitrogen). The STAT3 siRNA
were bought from RIBOBIO Company. Then Raloxifene
was added for another 24 hours and cleaved caspase-3 was
detected by Western Blot

Colony formation assay
Huh-7 and 7721 cell-lines were plated as single
cells in 6-well plates. Cells were treated with varying
concentrations of Raloxifene (50, 75 μM) or DMSO for
4 h. Then viable cells were determined by trypan blue
(Promoter Biotechnology Ltd) staining and counted.
Five thousand viable cells were seeded in 10 cm plates
and continued to grow for two to three weeks. Cells were
stained with 0.5% crystal violet (25% methanol) after
washed with cold PBS for twice and fixed with cold
paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After staining, the plates
were rinsed with water and dried.

Flow cytometry
Hep-G2 cancer cell-lines were seeded in a 6-well
plate as single cells and treated with Raloxifene (50, 75 μM)
or DMSO for 6 h. After removing the culture medium, the
cells were collected and stained using the annexin V-TITC
Assay Kit (KeyGen Biotech Co. Ltd) followed by the
manufacturer’s instructions. At least 1 × 104 cells were
analysed with flow cytometry for each sample.

Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate as single cells
and pretreated with Raloxifene for 4 h and then IL-6
was added for another 30 min. Cells were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 30 min, washed with PBS. 5%
BSA and 1% Triton-100 were used for blocking and
rupture of membrane for 30 min at room temperature,
and then stained with anti-human primary antibody at
4°C overnight. STAT3 antibody (1:100) were used. Cells
were incubated with anti-rabbit-FITC secondary antibody
(1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA) or Alexa Fluor Dye (1:100, Alexa Fluor 594

Human liver cancer cell-line, Hep-G2 (107 cells
in 100 μL of sterile PBS and matrigel), were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank region of male
athymic nude mice of 4–6-week of age. The next day
mice were randomly divided into two groups consisting
of 5–6 mice per group, and treated with vehicle control or
15 mg/kg Raloxifene (dissolved in 5% DMSO and 95%
hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin solution of concentration
of 20%) via oral administration daily. Tumors were
measured with a caliper and the volume were calculated
using V = π (width2 * length)/6, and the weight of nude

mice were measured every other day. After the treatment
with vehicle or Raloxifene for 19 days, tumors were
harvested from euthanized mice, weighed by electronic
scale, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in −80°C.
A portion of tumor tissues was embedded in Tissue-Tek
OCT compound, and stored at −80°C until use for IHC
staining. The rest of the tissues were homogenized to
examine the expression of STAT3 phosphorylation and
cleaved caspase-3 by western blot.

Statistical analysis
The data were presented as the mean ± SD for at
least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis
was performed with SPSS software (version 13.0). The
significant differences between any of the two groups were
evaluated by one-way analysis of ANOVA. Then LeastSignificant Difference (LSD) evaluated the difference
between two groups. Statistical significance was defined
as P < 0.05.
