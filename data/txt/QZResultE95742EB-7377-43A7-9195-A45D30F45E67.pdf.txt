Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) can often be cured by intensive chemotherapy, but the toxicity of such
therapy precludes its use in the elderly and in patients with endemic BL in developing countries,
necessitating new strategies. We used high throughput RNA sequencing and RNA interference
screening to discover essential regulatory pathways that cooperate with MYC, the defining
oncogene of this cancer. In 38% of sporadic BL (sBL) cases, oncogenic CCND3 mutations
produced highly stable cyclin D3 isoforms that drive cell cycle progression. In 70% of sBL cases,
mutations affecting the transcription factor TCF3 (E2A) or its negative regulator ID3 fostered
TCF3 dependency. TCF3 activated the pro-survival PI(3) kinase pathway in BL, in part by
augmenting constitutive B cell receptor signaling. These findings suggest opportunities to improve
therapy for patients with BL.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma derived from
germinal center B cells1. Translocation of the oncogene MYC is the hallmark of this
lymphoma subtype2–4, although similar translocations can occur in other aggressive
lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). By gene expression profiling,
BL is distinct from the germinal center B cell-like (GCB) subtype of DLBCL despite a
common cell of origin for these cancers, suggesting that BL may have a unique
pathogenesis5,6. BL is subdivided into a sporadic form (sBL) that is diagnosed in developed
countries, an EBV-associated endemic form (eBL) in Africa, New Guinea, and parts of
South America, and an HIV-associated form (hivBL). Although these BL subtypes share a
common gene expression signature, sBL can be distinguished from eBL and hivBL by gene
expression profiling, potentially reflecting distinct pathogenetic mechanisms7.
Intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, delivered both systemically and intrathecally, can
cure many patients with sBL, albeit with considerable morbidity and some mortality,
especially in elderly patients1. Similar regimens are not typically administered to patients
with eBL since therapy-associated immune suppression and other toxicities are not easily
managed in this setting8. Hence, less toxic yet effective therapies are desired for both sBL
and eBL.

In the present study, we sought to define new pathogenetic mechanisms in BL that might
suggest alternative treatment strategies. We used structural genomics to discover recurrent
single nucleotide variants (SNVs), several of which were preferentially associated with BL.
These data were cross-referenced with functional genomics data from RNA interference
screens of BL cell lines to discover pathways that BL cells rely on for proliferation and
survival.

Results
We developed an analytic pipeline to retrieve SNVs using massively parallel RNA
resequencing (RNA-seq) data that relied on the combined results from three different
sequence alignment tools (see Methods). As an initial check of this algorithm, we compared
these putative SNVs with those called based on complete genome sequencing of 2 DLBCL
tumors and observed an 89% true-positive rate (data not shown). We performed RNA-seq
on 28 sBL patient biopsy samples and 13 BL cell lines. For comparison, we used our
analytic pipeline to reanalyze previously published RNA-seq data from biopsy samples of
52 GCB DLBCL cases and 28 activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL cases9. SNVs present in
7 samples derived from normal B cell subpopulations were eliminated as false positives as
were known single nucleotide polymorphisms, leaving a remaining set of putative SNVs

(pSNVs) (Supplemental Table 1). By Sanger resequencing of genomic DNA, 95% of
pSNVs (495/518) were confirmed as true SNVs (Supplemental Table 2). On average, each
BL sample harbored 1641 pSNVs, with the majority being base pair transitions. The enzyme
AID is expressed in BL and has the potential to mutate the genome, with a bias towards
“hotspot” DNA (DGYW/WRCH) motifs within the first 2 kb of a transcriptional start site.
BL pSNVs coincided with AID hotspots in 2.3% of instances, a lower frequency than
observed in GCB or ABC DLBCL, but higher than the frequency of AID hotspots at SNPs
(Supplemental Figure 1A). Thus, while some BL mutations may be introduced by AID,
most are likely due to different mutational mechanisms.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Among BL samples, we searched for genes with recurrent non-synonymous pSNVs in their
coding regions, and evaluated whether the prevalence of pSNVs in these genes differed
between BL and DLBCL (Table 1). Several genes were mutated recurrently in both BL and
DLBCL (TP53, GNA13, MKI67, CCND3), although mutations affecting the p53 DNA
binding domain were significantly more common in BL, in keeping with previous work10
(Supplemental Figure 1B). Several genes that are frequently mutated in GCB DLBCL9,11,12
(EZH2, SGK1, BCL2) or ABC DLBCL13,14 (CD79B, MYD88) were rarely if ever mutated
in BL. Conversely, many pSNVs were significantly more frequent in BL, indicating a
divergent pathogenesis for this lymphoma subtype. At the top of this list was MYC, a gene
known to be subject to AID-dependent somatic hypermutation, frequently generating Myc
variants that have increased oncogenic potency15 (Supplemental Fig. 1C). A striking finding
was that the genes encoding the transcription factor TCF3 (E2A) and its negative regulator
ID3 were among the most frequently mutated genes in BL (see below). The helicase
DDX3X was mutated in over 30% of BL samples, including many inactivating mutations,
but only one GCB DLBCL had a pSNV in this gene. SMARCA4, encoding a component of
the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex was frequently mutated (Table 1), as were
other components of this complex (ARID1A, DPF1, ACTL6A) (Supplemental Table 2).
Overall, this mutational survey suggests that BL is pathogenetically distinct from other
aggressive lymphoma subtypes.

We were intrigued by the mutations in CCND3 since this gene encodes a D-type cyclin that
regulates the G1-S cell cycle transition in germinal center B cells, the cell of origin of
BL16,17. Sanger resequencing of genomic DNA confirmed that CCND3 incurred multiple
nonsense and frame shift mutations that removed up to 41 amino acids from the cyclin D3
carboxy-terminus (Figure 1A, B, Supplemental Table 3). In addition, recurrent missense
mutations affected a threonine residue at position 283 (T283), known to be involved in
cyclin D3 phosphorylation18, as well as nearby proline (P284) and isoleucine (I290)
residues. T283, P284, and I290 are conserved among cyclin D3 homologues in different
species and the same or related amino acids occur at corresponding positions in cyclin D1
and cyclin D2 (Figure 1A). At each of these positions, multiple amino acid substitutions
occurred, and most mutations were heterozygous. The incidence of CCND3 mutations
among sBL samples was 38%, with a potentially higher frequency in hivBL samples.
CCND3 mutations were significantly less prevalent among eBL samples (1.8%), indicating
a distinct genetic pathogenesis for this BL subtype. CCND3 mutations were also recurrent in
ABC and GCB DLBCL, as previously reported9, albeit at a lower frequency than in BL
(Figure 1B). In 3 BL and 2 DLBCL cases for which germline DNA was available, the
CCND3 mutations (R271fs, T283P, T283A, V287D) were confirmed to be of somatic
origin.
The G1-S phase transition is additionally regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p16, encoded by the CDKN2A gene, prompting us to search for mutations and homozygous
deletions in this gene in BL and DLBCL samples. BL harbored CDKN2A aberrations in
17% of samples, with 8% having both CCND3 and CDKN2A mutations, suggesting that

these genetic abnormalities might cooperatively deregulate the cell cycle in some aggressive
lymphomas (Figure 1C; Supplemental Tables 3, 4).

To explore the function of the CCND3 mutations, we constructed fusion proteins linking
green fluorescent protein (GFP) to either wild type or mutant cyclin D3. When expressed in
either a BL or ABC DLBCL cell line, all mutant isoforms accumulated to more than 10-fold
higher levels than the wild type isoform (Figure 1D). Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that
the mutant CCND3 isoforms had shorter half lives than wild type CCND3 (Supplemental
Figure 6G), again suggesting that the CCND3 mutations increase protein stability (Figure
1D). Consistent with this interpretation, the abundance of wild type cyclin D3-GFP was
increased by proteasome inhibition, but the mutant isoforms were not further stabilized
under this condition (Figure 1E and data not shown). These findings are consistent with
previous work linking T283 to cyclin D3 protein stability18, and further suggested that P284
and I290 are also involved in cyclin D3 protein turnover. The degradation of cyclin D3
involves phosphorylation of T283, although the nature of the kinase is unclear. In keeping
with this model, treatment of BL cells with the pan-phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid,
which generally increases protein phosphorylation, caused a marked destabilization of wild
type cyclin D3-GFP, but not T283A, P284L, Q276* or I290R cyclin D3-GFP (Figure 1F,
Supplemental Figure 2E). D-type cyclins are destabilized during S phase of the cell cycle
and are relatively stabile in G1 phase19. When BL cells were trapped in G1 phase by
treatment with the CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor PD 0332991, wild type cyclin D3-GFP levels
increased whereas mutant cyclin D3 isoforms were not further stabilized (Figure 1G and
data not shown), suggesting that the CCND3 mutations prevent the physiologic regulation of
cyclin D3 protein levels during the cell cycle.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a parallel effort, an RNA interference screen of lymphoma cell lines revealed that BL
lines depend on CDK6, a kinase that partners with D-type cyclins (Supplemental Figure 2A,
Supplemental Table 11). Knockdown of CDK6 caused a time-dependent reduction in cell
numbers in all BL lines, irrespective of CCND3 mutational status, as well as in some GCB
DLBCL lines (Figure 1H; Supplemental Figures 6A, F). Cyclin D3 knockdown was
similarly toxic (Figure 1H; Supplemental Figures 6A, C) and was associated with a G1
phase arrest, as expected (Supplemental Figure 2B). In contrast, knockdown of cyclin D1,
cyclin D2 or CDK4 had little if any effect on BL lines but was detrimental to cell line
models of other lymphoma subtypes (Supplemental Figures 2C, 6B, D, E, F). To test the
oncogenic potential of the cyclin D3 mutants, we transduced GFP-tagged wild type or
T283A mutant cyclin D3 into two lymphoma cell lines in which the endogenous wild type
cyclin D3 was knocked down by RNA interference. In both lines, cells transduced with the
cyclin D3 mutant had a marked proliferative advantage over untransduced cells, but
overexpression of wild type cyclin D3 had little effect (Figure 1I). Hence, BL lines rely on
cyclin D3/CDK6 for cell cycle progression and cyclin D3 mutants augment this effect.
To explore the therapeutic potential of the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD 0332991, we treated BL,
GCB DLBCL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines with the drug daily for 2 weeks.
After an initial G1 phase arrest, the BL and GCB DLBCL cell lines began to die by day 2,
with a steady accumulation of apoptotic cells over the course of treatment (Figure 1J). By
contrast, the MCL cell line arrested in G1 phase but did not undergo apoptosis. We next
treated a BL xenograft model with PD 0332991 after the establishment of tumors, and
observed a profound reduction in tumor volume after 6 days, resulting in the virtual
disappearance of tumor cells by day 10 (Figure 1K, Supplemental Figure 2D).
The highly recurrent mutations in TCF3 and ID3 suggested that the transcriptional
regulators encoded by these genes play a central role in BL pathogenesis, as they do in
normal B cell development (reviewed in ref. 20). Sanger resequencing of genomic DNA

confirmed ID3 and/or TCF3 mutations in sBL, hivBL, and eBL, in 70%, 67%, and 40% of
samples, respectively, but these mutations were rare or absent in other lymphoma subtypes
and in multiple myeloma (Figure 2A). ID3 mutations were more common than TCF3
mutations, occurring in 58% of sBL samples, with 13% harboring mutations in both genes.
The majority of cases with ID3 mutations had 2 or more separate mutations and in all tested
cases (n=26), the mutations were on separate alleles. By contrast, the majority (63%) of the
TCF3 mutations were present on only one allele (Supplemental Figure 3A; Supplemental
Table 5). Resequencing of available germ line DNA confirmed the somatic origin of 11 ID3
mutants (C10stop, Y49stop, L54V, V55 frame shift, P56T, L64F, L70P, Q71stop, V82Q100 deletion, D93 frame shift, A102D) and 3 TCF3 mutants (V557E, D561E, M572K).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The TCF3 locus encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms – E47 and E12 – that differ in
their basic-helix-loop-helix (B-HLH) DNA binding domains and have distinct functions
during normal B cell development21,22. All TCF3 mutations in BL affected the E47 B-HLH
domain (Figure 2B), with no mutations affecting E12, suggesting a non-redundant role for
E47 in BL pathogenesis. The E47 isoform was more highly expressed than the E12 isoform
in BL cases with E47 mutations (Supplemental Figure 3B), suggesting that the TCF3
mutations are gain-of-function. Four evolutionarily conserved amino acids were the target of
most of the E47 missense mutations, which occurred in both the basic DNA recognition
region (N551K, V557E/G) and in the HLH region (D561E/V/N, M572K) (Figure 2D;
Supplemental Table 5). The V557 is adjacent to D561 on a helical surface facing away from
DNA, suggesting that mutations affecting these positions could disrupt intra- or
intermolecular interactions. The B-HLH domain may also be distorted by lysine
substitutions affecting M572 and L597, which lie next to each other in the 3-dimensional
structure.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A variety of nonsense and frameshift mutations inactivate ID3 in BL tumors, in the majority
of the cases on both alleles, suggesting a tumor suppressor mechanism (Figure 2C;
Supplemental Table 5). Highly recurrent missense mutations target the ID3 loop region,
which is critical for the ability of ID proteins to block E47 DNA binding23. Two loop region
amino acids that border the helices are affected most often: leucine 64 (L64), which makes
van-der-Waals interactions with residues in the second HLH helix, and proline 56, which
kinks the loop region (Figure 2E). Additional loop region mutants affect proline 59, which
also kinks the loop, as well as glutamine 63, which makes hydrogen bonds with arginine 52
of the first helix. Hence, each of the loop region mutants has the potential to distort the
tertiary structure of the HLH domain and impair its ability to inhibit E47. In addition,
numerous ID3 missense mutations alter residues in the second helix of the HLH domain and,
to a lesser extent, the first helix, potentially compromising the ability of these mutants to
inhibit E47. Finally, multiple mutations disrupt a splice donor site in ID3, resulting in the
utilization of a cryptic splice donor and the deletion of 19 amino acids (Figure 2C;
Supplemental Figure 3C).
The RNA interference screen revealed that TCF3 is an essential gene in 4 BL cell lines
(Supplemental Figure 3D, Supplemental Table 11), supporting the notion that the TCF3 and
ID3 mutations in BL promote E47 action. Subsequent shRNA experiments revealed that
knockdown of TCF3 caused a time-dependent toxicity in all BL lines tested, including lines
with and without ID3 mutations, but had no effect on cell line models of ABC and GCB
DLBCL (Figure 2F; Supplemental Figures 3F, 7A, 7B). Wild type TCF3 was able to rescue
BL cells from shTCF3 toxicity (Supplemental Figure 3E). The TCF3 mutants were roughly
equivalent to wild type TCF3 in their ability to reverse TCF3 shRNA-mediated toxicity,
although the N551K mutant was somewhat less efficient in some cell lines. These results
underscore that the TCF3 mutants are not loss-of-function.

Introduction of wild type ID3 into BL cell lines with ID3 mutations was similarly lethal
(Figure 2G; Supplemental Figures 3G, 7C). By contrast, BL-derived ID3 mutants had less
(L64F) or no toxicity (P56S, E68*, Δ82–100) for the same BL cell lines, arguing that the
ID3 mutations are complete or partial loss-of-function alleles. To evaluate the ID3 mutants
biochemically, we inducibly expressed wild type or mutant ID3 isoforms in an ID3-deficient
BL cell line and analyzed both total ID3 protein levels and the ability of the ID3 isoforms to
interact with TCF3. Although the mRNA levels for each ID3 isoform were equivalent, no
detectable protein was observed for the three nonsense and frameshift mutants (C47*, E68*,
Q63fs), and the splice site mutant (Δ82–100) was barely detectable as a shorter ID3 isoform
(Figure 2I; Supplemental Figure 7E). The two common missense mutants were detectable,
but were expressed at lower levels than wild type ID3. Most of the ID3 mutant proteins
could not be detected by co-immunoprecipitation with TCF3 with the exception of L64F,
which associated with TCF3 much less robustly than wild type ID3 (Figure 2I). We
conclude that the recurrent ID3 mutations in BL serve to destabilize the protein and prevent
its inhibitory interaction with TCF3 E47.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate the influence of mutations in TCF3 on its ability to interact with ID3, we
expressed wild type ID3 in HEK293T cells together with wild type or mutant forms of TCF3
E47 or E12. In the absence of TCF3, ID3 protein did not accumulate appreciably, but was
increased by proteasomal inhibition (Supplemental Figure 7D). Titration of wild type E47 or
E12 caused ID3 protein levels to rise (Supplemental Figure 3H). ID3 protein efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with wild type E47 and E12 (Figure 2H). The N551K E47 mutant
behaved similarly to wild type E47 in this assay, but the V557E and D561E mutants did not
stabilize ID3 as well as wild type E47 and did not co-immunoprecipitate with ID3
efficiently. These results suggest that the most common TCF3 mutants, V557E and D561E,
are selected in BL tumors to evade negative regulation by ID3.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To gauge the ability of the TCF3 mutants to interact with chromatin, we engineered two BL
lines with wild type TCF3 to express a bacterial biotinylation enzyme and then expressed
wild type or mutant TCF3 (V557E, D561E, N551K) isoforms that were tagged with an
amino acid sequence (“Biotag”) that can be biotinylated by this enzyme. Streptavidin was
used to precipitate chromatin bound to each TCF3-Biotag isoform for ChIP-seq analysis. In
parallel, we performed ChIP-seq for endogenous TCF3 using anti-TCF3 antibodies in the
same BL lines (Supplemental Table 13), and were able to confirm all binding events tested
by conventional ChIP analysis (Supplemental Figure 3J). Of 2,117 genes that had
endogenous TCF3 binding peaks within 2 kb of the transcriptional start site (TSS) in both
BL lines, 93% had overlapping wild type Biotag-TCF3 peaks, indicating that the TCF3Biotag isoforms interacted with relevant chromatin targets. Both the endogenous and Biotag
TCF3 ChIP-seq peaks were enriched for E-box motifs: 5′-CAG(G/C)TG-3′, as expected.
Chromatin binding by wild type and mutant TCF3 isoforms overlapped substantially: wild
type TCF3-Biotag binding regions had at least 7 overlapping tags in the ChIP-seq data for
the V557E, D561E, N551K isoforms in 98%, 98% and 92% of instances, respectively
(Supplemental Table 12). Chromatin binding by wild type and mutant TCF3-Biotag to
representative genes is shown in Supplemental Figure 8.
Given the somewhat lower overlap between N551K and wild type TCF3 chromatin binding,
we identified genomic regions that were 4-fold higher (n=212) or lower (n=139) in their
association with wild type and N551K TCF3 in both BL cell lines (p<1E-10) (See Methods;
Supplemental Table 14). In these binding regions, the V557E and D561E isoforms behaved
similarly to wild type TCF3, again suggesting that these mutations do not alter their
chromatin binding specificity (Supplemental Table 14). The peaks bound more effectively
by wild type than N551K TCF3 contained multiple copies of the motif 5′-NNCACCTG-3′
whereas the peaks bound preferentially by N551K were enriched for the sequence 5′-

GGCAGCTG-3′ (Figure 2J). While both motifs conform to the E-box consensus, these
results suggest that N551K TCF3 is an altered specificity mutant that has somewhat
different genomic targets than wild type TCF3. Representative genes with differential
binding of wild type and N551K TCF3 are shown in Supplemental Figure 8B.
To gain insight into the biological processes controlled by TCF3 in BL, we knocked down
TCF3 expression or overexpressed wild type ID3 in ID3-mutant BL lines and profiled
changes in gene expression. We identified 139 “TCF3-upregulated” genes that were
decreased in expression by both manipulations and 166 “TCF3-downregulated” genes that
were increased in expression (Figure 2K; Supplemental Figure 4A). We confirmed the
TCF3-dependent regulation of several of these genes by RT-PCR (Supplemental Figure 3I).
Many of these TCF3 regulated genes are apparently direct targets of TCF3 based on ChIPseq analysis of endogenous TCF3 binding. We defined a “whole gene window” as the
genomic region encompassing the body of the gene as well as 10 kilobases of its upstream
promoter region. Based on this window, 20% (n=4,355) of protein-coding genes had TCF3
peaks in both the BL41 and Namalwa BL lines (Supplemental Table 13). TCF3 binding
peaks were enriched among TCF3-upregulated genes (58%; Chi-square p=1.81E-29) and
among TCF3–downregulated genes (32%; Chi-square p=1.03E-4). We will refer to the
genes that are both bound and regulated by TCF3 as “TCF3 direct targets”.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Expression of TCF3-regulated genes is a prominent characteristic of BL tumors. Using
available gene expression profiling datasets from BL, GCB DLBCL, and ABC DLBCL5,24,
we observed that TCF3 itself was 3.9-fold and 5.6-fold more highly expressed in BL than in
GCB DLBCL and ABC DLBCL, respectively (p<1E-16). Most TCF3-upregulated genes
were also more highly expressed in BL than in DLBCL whereas TCF3-downregulated genes
were generally expressed at lower levels in BL biopsies, demonstrating that a TCF3regulatory network contributes substantially to the BL phenotype (p≤0.001; Figure 2K;
Supplemental Figures 4A, B). In normal B cell subsets, the TCF3-upregulated genes were
more highly expressed in germinal center B cells than in resting or activated blood B cells
whereas the TCF3-downregulated genes were at lower levels in germinal center B cells
(Figure 2K; Supplemental Figure 4A). Hence, the TCF3 gene expression program in BL
appears to be “inherited” from its normal cellular counterpart, in keeping with the
requirement for TCF3 in normal germinal center B cell responses25. However, by gene set
enrichment analysis, BL tumors with ID3 and/or TCF3 mutations had higher expression of
the TCF3-upregulated signature than BL tumors with wild type ID3 and TCF3, and the
opposite was true for the TCF3-downregulated signature (p=0.0001; Supplemental Figure
4C). Hence, the transcriptional influence of TCF3 on the BL phenotype appears to be
accentuated by ID3/TCF3 mutations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Biological insights from this analysis included the observation that the negative regulators of
TCF3 – ID1, ID2, and ID3 – were each TCF3 direct targets that were upregulated by TCF3,
thereby creating an autoregulatory negative feedback loop (Figure 2K; Supplemental Figure
8A). TCF3 also positively regulated several genes that play crucial roles in normal germinal
center B cell formation and/or maintenance, including POU2AF1, CXCR4, LTB and
CCND3. Interestingly, though, TCF3 also positively regulated PRDM1 (encoding Blimp-1)
and XBP1, suggesting that TCF3 may bias germinal center B cells towards plasmacytic
differentiation. TCF3 upregulated CCND3 and E2F2, which both promote cell cycle
progression, while downregulating RB1, which encodes a tumor suppressor that blocks the
G1-S phase transition. It has long been known that TCF3 regulates the antigen-binding
components of the BCR, the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light chains22,26. As
expected, TCF3 could be readily detected at the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and κ
light chain (Igκ) 3′ enhancers in BL cells and TCF3 increased their IgH and Igκ mRNA
expression (Figure 2K; Supplemental Figures 3I, J, 8A). ChIP-seq analysis in BL revealed

that TCF3 also binds to genes encoding other BCR components (CD79A, CD79B), BCR
coreceptors (CD19, CD21, CD22), and BCR-associated kinases (LYN, FYN, BLK, LCK,
SYK), many of which are also TCF3 targets in mouse precursor B cells27 (Supplemental
Table 13).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this regard, it was particularly notable that knockdown of the BCR subunit CD79A was
toxic for several BL lines in our RNA interference screen, as well as for ABC DLBCL
lines13, but did not affect cell line models of GCB DLBCL and MCL (Supplemental Figure
5A). In a panel of 9 BL cell lines, 6 were clearly BCR-dependent, based on a timedependent decrease in their viability following knockdown of either CD79A or the BCRassociated tyrosine kinase SYK (Figure 3A). Knockdown of CARD11, an adapter that links
the BCR to the NF-κB pathway in ABC DLBCL28, was lethal for one BL cell line but did
not affect the other BCR-dependent BL cell lines (Figure 3A; Supplemental Figure 5A).
Moreover, BL lines were insensitive to the selective IκB kinase inhibitor MLN120B,
whereas ABC DLBCL lines were sensitive, as expected29, confirming that BL lines do not
depend strongly on the classical NF-κB pathway for survival (Supplemental Figure 5C).
Given this, we speculated that the BCR-dependency of some BL lines might be more akin to
“tonic” BCR signaling, as defined in normal mature mouse B cells30,31, a phenomenon that
relies on the pro-survival action of the PI(3) kinase pathway more than the NF-κB
pathway32. Indeed, knockdown of the BCR component CD79A in BCR-dependent BL cell
lines decreased phosphorylation of AKT, a modification that depends on PI(3) kinase
signaling (Figure 3B). SYK, a tyrosine kinase that is activated by BCR signaling, was also
required to maintain AKT phosphorylation in BL lines (Figure 3B).
Of note, TCF3 knockdown also decreased phospho-AKT levels in BCR-dependent lines
tested, as did ID3 overexpression (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 5B). This may be
explained in part by the downmodulation of surface BCR expression that occurred upon
TCF3 depletion (Figure 3C). TCF3 also binds directly to the promoter of PTPN6, encoding
the phosphatase SHP-1 that inhibits B cell receptor (BCR) signaling (Supplemental Figures
3J, 8A). Knockdown of TCF3 increased PTPN6 mRNA and protein levels, indicating that
TCF3 represses PTPN6 transcription, in accord with previous work demonstrating
downregulation of SHP-1 in normal germinal centers and BL tumors33 (Figure 3D;
Supplemental Figures 3I, 4A). Ectopic provision of SHP-1 decreased phospho-AKT in
BCR-dependent BL lines, suggesting that TCF3-mediated repression of PTPN6 may
augment BCR signaling in BL (Figure 3E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A screen of a larger number of BL cell lines revealed that all had readily detectable AKT
phosphorylation that was inhibited by treatment with a PI(3) kinase inhibitor, LY294002
(Figure 3F). Moreover, the mTOR pathway was engaged by PI(3) kinase signaling in BL
lines, as judged by phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate p70 S6 kinase (Figure 3F).
Treatment of BL cell lines with BKM120, a PI(3) kinase inhibitor in clinical trials34, or
rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTORC1 complex, was toxic to most BL cell lines tested
(Figures 3G, H). Hence, PI(3) kinase signaling promotes cell survival in both BCRdependent and BCR-independent BL cell lines. Other mechanisms to augment PI(3) kinase
signaling in BL include mutation of PTEN: 3 BL samples had 4 separate PTEN missense
mutations, 3 of which have been documented in other cancers35 (Supplemental Table 2).
MYC deregulation in BL contributes to PI(3) kinase signaling by driving expression or
MIR17HG, the precursor RNA for miR-19, an inhibitor of PTEN expression36,37. Indeed,
MIR17HG expression was 10-fold higher in BL than DLBCL by digital gene expression,
which was confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplemental Figure 5D and data not shown). Finally,
we used gene expression signatures of mTOR activity to investigate this pathway in BL
tumors. We developed gene expression signatures comprised of genes that were either up- or
down-regulated following treatment of BL cell lines with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin

(Supplemental Table 10). Among tumor biopsies of BL and GCB DLBCL5, rapamycin
down-regulated genes were enriched among genes that were more highly expressed in BL
tumors (p=0.026; KS statistic), whereas rapamycin up-regulated genes had the opposite
enrichment pattern (p=0.007) (Figure 3I; Supplemental Figure 5E). Rapamycin downregulated genes were also more highly expressed in BL than in other aggressive lymphomas
(ABC DLBCL, PMBL) (Figure 3I), supporting the notion that mTORC1 activity is a
consistent feature of BL tumors.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

By merging functional and structural genomic data, we have uncovered previously
unappreciated pathways in BL pathogenesis, several of which are amenable to therapeutic
attack. We observed striking differences in the frequency of certain genetic abnormalities
between BL and GCB DLBCL, despite the fact that both malignancies presumably arise
from germinal center B cells (Table 1). The recurrent mutations in ID3, and TCF3 were
shared by sBL, hivBL, and eBL, suggesting a common BL pathogenesis irrespective of
epidemiology. That said, the frequency of CCND3 mutations was much lower in eBL than
in the sBL and hivBL subtypes, suggesting that distinct transforming events may be required
in eBL. Our working hypothesis is that these genetic differences are dictated by the
occurrence of the MYC translocation early in the pathogenesis of BL as opposed to its
acquisition as a progression event in GCB DLBCL. These genetic contrasts are so stark that
they could be used as an aid to the diagnostic distinction between BL and GCB DLBCL,
which can be difficult in some instances using current methods5,6.
Our findings lead to an integrated model of BL pathogenesis that is summarized in Figure 4.
MYC translocations initiate BL, with a majority of these tumors acquiring MYC mutations
that may enhance its function, including several novel recurrent mutations discovered here.
Clearly, agents targeting MYC, such as those that inhibit its transcription38–40 will be
attractive candidates for BL clinical trials. However, our functional and structural genomics
analysis revealed several additional oncogenic pathways in BL, suggesting that translocation
of MYC is insufficient to cause human BL.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aside from MYC translocation, mutations in TCF3 and/or ID3 were the most common
genetic events in BL, occurring in more than two thirds of sBL and hivBL cases and in 40%
of eBL cases. Most of these mutations block the interaction between TCF3 and ID3, thereby
breaking the negative autoregulatory loop created by TCF3 transactivation of ID3. The
TCF3 transcriptional program in BL includes many genes that distinguish normal germinal
center B cells from other mature B cells subsets, and, in part, this accounts for the distinct
gene expression profiles of BL and DLBCL5,6. Interestingly, all BL cell lines were
dependent upon TCF3 for survival, including those with and without mutations in TCF3/
ID3, which likely reflects the essential role for this transcription factor in normal germinal
center responses16,17. Hence, TCF3 appears to act as a “lineage-survival oncogene”41 for
BL.
PI(3) kinase signaling emerges from our work as an essential and pervasive pro-survival
mechanism in BL. All BL lines had readily apparent PI(3) kinase activity and were killed
efficiently by inhibitors of this pathway. Moreover, analysis of gene expression signatures of
rapamycin-sensitive mTOR activity indicated that this pathway is likely to be more active in
BL than in other aggressive lymphoma subtypes. Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute
to PI(3) kinase activity in BL. Although mutations in PTEN may occasionally activate PI(3)
kinase signaling in BL, most BL biopsies and cell lines lacked mutations in PTEN or
PIK3CA. Transactivation of MIR17HG by MYC in BL, together with amplification of the
MIR17HG locus in ~10% of BL tumors42, would lead to miR-19-mediated PTEN

inactivation and consequent PI(3) kinase signaling. In two thirds of the BL lines tested, PI(3)
kinase signaling was promoted by constitutive BCR signaling that is akin to the “tonic”
BCR signaling that sustains normal mouse B cell viability30–32. TCF3 also promoted PI(3)
kinase activity, potentially by transactivating the immunoglobulin loci, thereby upregulating
surface BCR expression, and by inhibiting expression of PTPN6, encoding the SHP-1
phosphatase that blocks proximal BCR signaling43.
Another key direct target of TCF3 is CCND3, a regulator of the G1-S phase transition that is
required for an effective germinal center reaction16,17. Cyclin D3 and its partner CDK6 were
required for the proliferation of BL as well as GCB DLBCL cells, even in cell line models
with wild type CCND3, probably reflecting the role of cyclin D3 in normal germinal center
B cells. Burkitt lymphomas capitalize on this cell cycle regulatory machinery by mutating
CCND3 in 38% of sBL cases, resulting in highly stable cyclin D3 isoforms that drive cells
to proliferate vigorously. The G1-S phase restriction point is further deregulated by
inactivating mutations and deletions targeting p16. Treatment of BL cell lines with a
CDK4/6 inhibitor not only caused cell cycle arrest but, unexpectedly, induced apoptosis in
vitro and regression of established BL xenografts.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While BL can be cured in developed countries in ~85% of cases occurring in younger
patients using high-dose chemotherapy regimens1, these regimens are unsafe in older
patients and cannot be deployed in less developed regions due to their immune suppression
and due to logistical difficulties that preclude effective delivery8. Hopefully, the new
insights into BL pathogenesis described herein will prompt clinical evaluation of drugs
targeting the PI(3) kinase pathway, tonic BCR signaling, and cyclin D3/CDK6 in BL.
Eventually, the rational combination of such targeted agents may provide more effective and
less toxic treatment of BL worldwide.

published gene expression profiling datasets from BL, GCB DLBCL, and ABC DLBCL
were used5. Expression in normal B cell subpopulations was based on RNA-seq. Genes were
ranked according to the difference in expression between BL and ABC DLBCL. FS:

a, CD79A and SYK knockdown is toxic for a subset of BL cell lines. Vectors co-expressing
either CD79A or SYK shRNAs together with GFP were transduced into the indicated cell
lines. shRNA expression was induced for the indicated times and the fraction of live GFP+,
shRNA+ cells was normalized to the value on day 0. BCR-dependent BL lines are depicted
using red colors. The BCR-dependent ABC DLBCL line TMD813 is also shown. Data
represent at least three independent experiments. b, Knockdown of CD79A, SYK or TCF3
reduces PI(3) kinase activity. The indicated BL cell lines were transduced with a control
shRNA or shRNAs targeting CD79A, SYK, or TCF3. shRNA expression was induced for 2
days, and cells were analyzed by FACS for phospho-S473-AKT staining as a measure of
PI(3) kinase activity. c, TCF3 regulates expression of the B cell receptor (BCR) in BL. An
shRNA targeting TCF3 or a control shRNA was induced in the indicated BL cell lines for 1
day. Surface expression of the BCR was quantified by FACS analysis of the BCR subunit
CD79B. d, TCF3 suppresses PTPN6 (SHP-1) expression. The indicated BL cells were
transduced with an shRNA targeting TCF3 and analyzed by Western blot analysis for the
indicated proteins. e, Ectopic expression of SHP-1 suppresses phospho-S473-AKT in BL
cell lines. Indicated cell lines were transduced with SHP-1 expression vector (+) or an empty
vector control (−), whereupon cells were subjected to Western Blot analysis of indicated
proteins. f, BL cell lines have constitutively high levels of PI(3) kinase activity. Western blot
analysis of BL cell lines revealed high levels of phospho-S473-AKT and phospho-T309p70S6K, which were reduced by treatment with the PI(3) kinase inhibitor LY294002, as
indicated. g, Inhibition of PI(3) kinase activity is toxic to BL cell lines. Shown are viable
cells, as quantified by MTS assay, in cultures of BL lines treated with indicated

concentrations of the pan-class I PI(3) kinase inhibitor BKM120. h, Inhibition of mTOR
activity is lethal to most BL cell lines. Shown are viable cells, as quantified by an MTS
assay, in cells treated with the indicated concentrations of rapamycin. i, Genes down
regulated by Rapamycin are highly expressed in BL. Changes of gene expression were
profiled in BL cell lines following Rapamycin (100 pM) addition for indicated time points.
Shown are genes that were downregulated by at least 0.4 log2 in at least 3 of 4 time points in
both cell lines. Previously published gene expression profiling datasets from BL, GCB
DLBCL, and ABC DLBCL were used5.
