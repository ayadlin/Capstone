Abstract
The recent development of hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging provides a novel method for in vivo metabolic imaging with potential applications for detection of cancer and response to
treatment. Chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was shown to decrease the flux of hyperpolarized 13C label
from pyruvate to lactate due to depletion of NADH, the coenzyme of lactate dehydrogenase. In contrast,
we show here that in PC-3MM2 tumors, inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor with imatinib
reduces the conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate by lowering the expression of lactate dehydrogenase itself. This was accompanied by reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and glutaminase, and is likely mediated by reduced expression of their transcriptional factors hypoxia-inducible
factor-1 and c-Myc. Our results indicate that hyperpolarized 13C MRSI could potentially detect the molecular
effect of various cell signaling inhibitors, thus providing a radiation-free method to predict tumor response.

Introduction
Aerobic glycolysis, the switch in glucose metabolism from
oxidative phosphorylation to enhanced glycolysis, occurs in
cancer cells even in the presence of adequate oxygen levels.
This phenomenon, first described by Otto Warburg in the
1920s, is referred to as the Warburg effect (1). The understanding that metabolism is tightly regulated by signaling pathways
and transcriptional programs, together with the development
of diagnostic tools such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET), has led to a renewed interest in the Warburg effect (1), which was recently described as
the seventh hallmark of cancer (2–5).
Modulation of glycolysis can be used as an indicator of
treatment efficacy (4). For example, in the case of imatinib,
an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 and tyrosine
kinases associated with the receptors for stem cell factor
(c-KIT) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR; refs. 6–8),
FDG-PET was used to detect a rapid reduction in glucose

uptake following treatment of patients with gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST) that carry a gain-of-function mutation in c-KIT (9). Importantly, metabolic changes were associated with complete remission, whereas a lack of metabolic
change was associated with resistance to imatinib (9, 10).
Another powerful tool for the study of metabolism and
bioenergetics is magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
MRS was used to detect a decrease in uptake of 13C-labeled
glucose in response to imatinib in BCR-ABL1–positive
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, demonstrating a reversal of the Warburg effect (11). However, the intrinsically
low sensitivity and long sampling times have limited the
use of 13C MRS to metabolic studies of experimental models. The recent development of hyperpolarized 13C magnetic
resonance (MR) using dynamic nuclear polarization, and a
dissolution method that maintains hyperpolarization of injectable molecules in the liquid state, has resulted in an increase in the 13C MR signal-to-noise ratio by >10,000-fold
(12). This has opened the door to numerous MRS and
MRS imaging (MRSI) applications, including in vivo imaging
of metabolic rates in real time and assessment of tumor
response to chemotherapy (13, 14).
Recently, we showed that 13C MRS of hyperpolarized pyruvate can be used to detect metabolic changes resulting
from treatment with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (15). Cell signaling through the
PI3K pathway can be activated by various receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK). In the present study, we describe a thorough
investigation of signal inhibition with imatinib by using, for
the first time, hyperpolarized 13 C MRSI to monitor the
metabolic consequences of RTK signal inhibition in vivo.
Our results inform on the mechanism by which inhibition

of cell signaling affects metabolism and show that hyperpolarized 13C MRSI has potential as a valuable tool for detecting in vivo response to imatinib and other targeted therapies
that inhibit signaling upstream of hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(HIF-1) and c-Myc.

Materials and Methods
In vivo hyperpolarized 13C MRSI and macromolecular
dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging
All animal studies were carried out according to the guidelines, and following approval, of the University of California,
San Francisco, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
We deposited 2 × 105 PC-3MM2 cells in the tibia of CD1 nude
mice and imaged 7- to 10-mm tumors before and at the end
of 2 days of treatment with imatinib (50 mg/kg daily; kindly
provided by Novartis Pharma), alone or in combination with
paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb; 8 mg/kg once; ref. 16).
We used a dual-tuned 1H/13C mouse birdcage coil and
3T GE Signa scanner (GE Healthcare) to acquire localizing
T2-weighted images in three planes followed by dynamic
two-dimensional 13C MRSI in axial orientation (multiband
excitation pulse applying a flip angle of 3.3° to pyruvate
and 20° to lactate and alanine, echo-planar readout, TR/TE
250/160 ms, 2-second acquisition time per image, voxel size
5 × 5 × 10 mm; ref. 17). Hyperpolarized pyruvate (350 μL
of 80 mmol/L; ref. 17) was injected to isoflurane (1–2%)anesthetized mice over 12 seconds through a tail vein catheter, followed by a 150-μL PBS flush. Acquisition started at
the end of the 12-second pyruvate injection and repeated
every 5 seconds up to 100 seconds.
After changing the RF coil to a high-resolution custombuilt 1H-mouse knee coil, a localizing T2-weighted axial imaging was followed by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI; three-dimensional fast spoiled
gradient recalled sequence, TR/TE 24.7/3.4 ms, flip angle 35°,
2 NEX, slice thickness 600 μm, in-plane resolution 156 ×
156 μm, acquisition time 3.4 minutes) acquired preinjection
and postinjection of albumin-GdDTPA (200 μL of 4 μmol/kg
followed by flush; refs. 18, 19).
In vivo data processing
Imaging data were processed with custom in-house software using MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc.). The dynamic 13C
MRSI was reconstructed (Supplementary Fig. S1) and the
noise was estimated from the last time point when the hyperpolarized signal had decayed completely. Signal-to-noise ratio
values were then normalized to percentage of polarization
measured using an aliquot of the hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate
injected into a polarimeter, and to injected volume. Overlay
images of lactate peak amplitudes on the anatomic images
were generated by applying a cubic interpolation spatially to
match the resolution of the anatomic images (Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S2).
We generated maximal intensity projections (MIP) of DCEMRI for each postcontrast time point after subtraction of the
precontrast dataset. Signal intensity (SI) values were normal-

ized to the dynamic range of SI, and semiquantitative analysis of vascular permeability was performed by calculating the
change in SI (contrast accumulation) during the first 15 minutes postcontrast (ΔSI/dt) for a region of interest manually
drawn around the entire tumor and using linear regression to
fit the data (Supplementary Fig. S3). Tumor volume was evaluated from three-dimensional MR images by drawing regions
of interest around the tumor in all relevant slices, adding tumor voxels and multiplying by voxel size.
In vitro hyperpolarized 13C MRS
We performed the MRS studies of PC-3MM2 cells (20) after
2 days of activation and inhibition of PDGFR signaling with
recombinant human PDGF-BB (20 ng/mL; Invitrogen) and
imatinib (5 or 50 μmol/L), respectively. We encapsulated
6 × 107 to 8 × 107 cells into agarose beads. A day later, we
loaded the beads into a perfusion system (15, 21, 22). We polarized [1-13C]pyruvic acid and [5-13C]glutamine (Isotec) to
∼20% and ∼5% (17, 23), and injected the polarized substrate
to a final concentration of 5 and 2.5 mmol/L, respectively,
during acquisition of 13 C spectra on a 500-MHz INOVA
spectrometer (Varian), while medium circulation was briefly
stopped (15). Glutamine was also injected directly into a cell
lysate (6 × 107–8 × 107 cells; ref. 23).
We recorded 13C spectra (single transient every 3 seconds,
13° excitation pulses) and 31P spectra (to confirm cell viability) on a 500 MHz INOVA spectrometer (Varian), and quantified the intensities of metabolite peaks by integration (ACD/
Spec Manager, Advanced Chemistry Development) and normalization to total carbon signal and cell number (15).
Immunostaining and immunoblotting
Tissue sections (prepared as described in ref. 16) from untreated and 2-day treated tumors, and whole cell lysates
[radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA); Cell Signaling, or 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.2), 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol,
2 mmol/L EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100] or nuclear extracts
(for HIF-1α; ref. 24) from tumors and cells, were probed with
the following: rabbit antibodies against cleaved caspase-3,
caspase-3, c-Myc, AKT, p-AKT, β-actin (Cell Signaling),
c-Myc, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-A (Epitomics), vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbonic anhydrase IX
(CAIX; Abcam), HIF-1α (Novus), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse antibody
against glutaminase (Abcam), and fluorescent (Invitrogen)
or horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary antibodies (Cell
Signaling or Abcam). For loading control in Western blots
(Supplementary Fig. S4), anti–β-actin was used in combination with other antibodies or after striping the membrane.
Quantification was performed using Photoshop by measuring
band intensities in scanned blots, subtracting background intensity, and normalizing to loading control. Results are presented as percentage of control (untreated tumors).
LDH activity and NAD(H) assays
The activity of LDH was measured (25) in tumor lysate
(RIPA). KM and Vmax values were determined by fitting initial rates of NADH consumption (absorbance at 340 nm)

and pyruvate concentrations to a Lineweaver-Burke plot.
The levels of total NAD(H) in lysates (freeze-thaw) were determined by measuring the change in absorbance at 570 nm
due to reduction of thiazolyl blue by NADH (26).
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as means ± SD. Statistical analyses
were performed using an analytical computerized software

(Statistix 8 Student Edition, Analytical Software). The effect
of imatinib versus imatinib-paclitaxel treatment on the
MRSI signal (Δ) between day 0 and day 2 of treatment
was evaluated using Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric oneway ANOVA because the data were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test) and the variances were not equal
between the groups (Bartlett's test). This comparison between the treatments indicated no statistical difference

Results
Signal inhibition with imatinib reduces the
hyperpolarized lactate signal
PDGFR expression and activation, and PDGFR inhibition
with imatinib or imatinib in combination with paclitaxel,
were previously established in the PC-3MM2 prostate cancer
bone metastasis model (16, 27–29). To study the possible
metabolic consequences of signal inhibition in PC-3MM2 tumors, we investigated the fate of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate
using MRSI (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).
Hyperpolarized [1- 13 C]pyruvate can be enzymatically
converted to [1-13C]lactate and [1-13C]alanine, or enter the
mitochondria and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as acetyl-CoA, in which case H13CO3− (bicarbonate) is produced.
Bicarbonate and alanine have been detected in normal tissue
(heart, kidneys, liver) together with baseline levels of lactate
(30–32), whereas conversion of pyruvate into lactate is dominant under hypoxic conditions (anaerobic glycolysis) and in
tumor cells performing aerobic glycolysis (2, 33). Accordingly, we detected significantly higher lactate signal in the
tumor than in the muscle of the contralateral limb (n = 10,
P = 0.016). We then investigated the effects of imatinib or
imatinib-paclitaxel combination. Importantly, no statistically
significant difference was observed in any of the metabolic
effects of treatment between the two treatment groups
(P > 0.9999), indicating that our findings are likely due mostly to the effect of imatinb. Consequently, data from imatinib
and imatinib-paclitaxel–treated animals were combined. Following treatment, lactate signal—normalized to noise, percentage of polarization, and injected volume—dropped
significantly by 33 ± 26% in treated animals (Figs. 1 and
2A; n = 10; P = 0.021), whereas there was no significant
change in the contralateral limb (n = 10; P = 0.5). A similar
decrease was observed when lactate signal was normalized
to control lactate signal as measured in the contralateral
limb (Fig. 2B; 30 ± 65%; n = 10; P = 0.036) or when it was
normalized to blood pyruvate, as measured from the tail
(Fig. 2C; 34 ± 53%; n = 10; P = 0.042). At the same time,
and in line with previous findings, treatment did not affect
tumor size when compared with control. Tumor volume increased by 16% between day 0 and day 2 in both treated tumor (from 291 ± 184 to 339 ± 220 mm3; n = 10) and untreated
tumor (from 225 ± 95 to 261 ± 117 mm3) groups (P = 0.5).
Long-term imatinib treatment of the same tumor model inhibited tumor growth (25, 26). Thus, 13C MRSI can detect reduced conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate in
PDGFR-expressing tumors treated with imatinib before the
decrease in tumor size becomes apparent.

Signal inhibition with imatinib reduces vascular
permeability and VEGF expression
Whereas in long-term treatment, imatinib inhibited tumor growth, partially by sensitizing PDGFR-expressing,
tumor-associated endothelial cells to paclitaxel-mediated
cytotoxicity (27, 28), the vascular effect of short-term treatment with imatinib was apparent as reduced vascular permeability without any additional effect of paclitaxel (16). To
confirm vascular response in the same tumors studied by
metabolic imaging, we used macromolecular DCE-MRI.
The macromolecular contrast material, albumin-GdDTPA,
extravasated from permeable vessels in the periphery of
PC-3MM2 tumors (Fig. 3A, d0; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Semiquantitative analysis of accumulation of contrast with
time (ΔSI/dt) indicated that 11 ± 7% of total tumor voxels
(21,864 ± 18,469 voxels, which mapped to tumor periphery)
were hyperpermeable (ΔSI/dt > 7.5 AU/min). This number
significantly dropped to 4,261 ± 3,164 voxels (2 ± 2% relative
to pretreatment) in response to treatment, whereas the
number of voxels with low permeability increased (Fig. 3B;
n = 10; P < 0.03).
This significant decease in vascular permeability is in
agreement with our measurements in an earlier study of

the same model using a full quantitative analysis (16).
Although that earlier study indicated no change in tumor
blood volume (vessel density) in response to treatment,
the decrease in permeability suggests partial normalization
of tumor vessel function, returning to permeability levels of

normal tissue. Additionally, changes in permeability can indicate changes in the levels of VEGF, a major permeability
factor (19). Indeed, we found that the decrease in permeability was associated with a decrease in the expression
of VEGF (Fig. 3C).

after each MRSI study, before (d0) and after

Imatinib-induced metabolic effect is independent of
tumor vasculature
The imatinib-induced vascular response following 2 days
of treatment did not include a decrease in tumor blood volume (16) or induction of apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial cells as determined by caspase-3 staining (data not
shown). Nonetheless, we were concerned that delivery of pyruvate to the tumor might be impaired by treatment and thus
contribute to the observed metabolic effect. To further validate the direct metabolic effect of imatinib on tumor cells,
independent of tumor vasculature and systemic substrate
delivery, we studied the fate of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate
in PC-3MM2 cells encapsulated into agarose beads and
maintained in a perfusion system. In control cells, PDGF
signaling was associated with substantial conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate into lactate, whereas inhibition of the
PDGF-activated signaling with imatinib resulted in a 40 ±
21% decrease in maximum lactate signal (Fig. 4; n = 3;
P = 0.024). This decrease in lactate signal is in line with our
results in vivo, indicating that the metabolic effect of imatinib
is not simply due to impaired substrate delivery but can
mostly be attributed to a direct effect on the tumor cells.
Imatinib blockade of cell signaling reduces expression
and activity of LDH
Next, we wanted to investigate more closely the reason
for the change in lactate signal. The enzymatic pyruvateto-lactate conversion by LDH is bidirectional and rapidly
reaches dynamic steady state. The decrease in lactate signal
observed with 13C MRS(I) upon treatment could reflect a
decrease in the amount of enzyme (LDH), endogenous
substrates (pyruvate and lactate), or the required coenzyme
(NADH; ref. 14), or could be affected by the rate of pyruvate
trans-membrane transport via MCT1 (34) and other MCTs.
In another experimental system, chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis resulted in a drop in hyperpolarized lactate due to
activation of poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, which leads to depletion of NADH (14, 35). However, using immunostaining of
tumor sections with the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3,
we detected very low levels of apoptosis in both control
and treated tumors (Fig. 5A), and the total NAD(H) pool
dropped slightly, but not significantly, from 2.30 ± 0.09 to
1.78 ± 0.76 μmol NADH per gram of tissue protein (P = 0.16).
Furthermore, we did not detect a change in MCT1 expression
(data not shown).
In contrast, staining for LDH-A showed a high level of
enzyme expression at the outer rim of untreated tumors
and dramatically lower levels in treated tumors (Fig. 5A).
Immunoblotting of tissue extracts further confirmed that
cleaved caspase-3 was below the detection level in all treatments, whereas LDH-A was elevated in controls and reduced following treatment (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S4).
In addition, we evaluated LDH enzymatic activity in tumor
lysates in an assay independent of trans-membrane transport and levels of endogenous substrate showing that treatment reduced the LDH tissue Vmax by 42 ± 19% (P = 0.014)
relative to controls (Fig. 5C), consistent with a drop in tissue enzyme level.

cells express PDGFR when cultured in the presence of serum or PDGF.
Cultured PC-3MM2 cells were stimulated with PDGF (20 ng/mL) to
ensure complete activation of PDGFR signaling, and treated with imatinib
(50 μmol/L; IM) for 1 d before encapsulation and for an additional day
before 13C MRS study in a perfusion system. A, dynamic changes in
pyruvate and lactate peak areas after injection of hyperpolarized
pyruvate. B, quantitative evaluation indicated a significant decrease in
maximum lactate signal normalized to cell number and maximum
total 13C (n = 3; *, P = 0.024).

Taken together, these results show that imatinib affects tumor metabolism mostly by modulating LDH expression and
its enzymatic activity.
Vascular and metabolic effects of imatinib are
associated with reduced activity of HIF-1α and
expression of c-Myc
The concurrent vascular and metabolic response might
suggest that both are mediated by the same factor(s) downstream of PDGFR signaling. One possible regulator is the
hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF-1, that regulates
many angiogenic factors and glycolytic enzymes, including
VEGF, CAIX, and LDH-A (36–38). Another transcription factor highly involved in the regulation of tumor cell metabolism

high immunostaining for cell surface CAIX (which serves as a
sensitive indicator of HIF-1 activity; ref. 38) and for nuclear
c-Myc in control tumors, and a much lower level of staining
in treated tumors (Fig. 6A). Immunoblotting of tumor extracts also indicated a decreasing trend in HIF-1α expression
and HIF-1 transcriptional activity (probed with CAIX) and a
significant drop in c-Myc in treated tumors (P = 0.008; Fig. 6B;
Supplementary Fig. S4). These findings indicate that the
metabolic effect of imatinib, inhibiting cell signaling, correlates with expression and/or activation of both transcription
factors HIF-1α and c-Myc.

Tumor cells with high expression of c-Myc were reported
to depend on glutamine uptake and glutaminolysis for survival and growth (42, 43). Accordingly, we detected elevated
levels of glutaminase in untreated tumors and a decrease
in glutaminase expression following treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). We also observed a drop in glutaminase levels
following treatment with imatinib of cells activated with
PDGF (Supplementary Fig. S4). These changes followed
the pattern observed for LDH-A and c-Myc (Figs. 5 and
6). Imaging the glutamine to glutamate conversion using
hyperpolarized glutamine (23) could thus provide an additional approach for monitoring PDGFR inhibition. We were
not successful in detecting this conversion in vivo, in

encapsulated cells, or in cell lysates, but this method could
prove useful in other systems.

Discussion
In this study, we have investigated the consequences of
signal inhibition with imatinib in an in vivo tumor model
with elevated PDGFR signaling. We describe the metabolic
consequences of treatment as detected by hyperpolarized
13
C MRSI, as well as their underlying mechanism. Proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth are often termed uncontrolled or dysregulated. However, signaling pathways and
transcriptional networks tightly regulate cellular metabolism
in both quiescent and proliferating cells. As more pieces of
the intracellular machinery puzzle fall into place, it seems
that proliferation of cancer cells requires a switch to a
metabolic program that provides sufficient energy while
channeling precursors for the biosynthesis of macromolecules needed for cell doubling (3). The metabolic switch that
supports proliferation can be triggered by extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and stress conditions,
or by various mutations that result in the continuous activation of signaling pathways. Thus, although many tumors
switch to aerobic glycolysis, the trigger for this metabolic
switch may vary.
Identifying the tumorigenic trigger and detecting the
metabolic consequences could identify targets for drug design and provide powerful diagnostic tools. BCR-ABL1 and
mutated c-KIT serve as such triggers in CML and GIST, leading to constitutively active tyrosine kinases. The prototype of
targeted drugs, imatinib, was first designed to target BCRABL1 (6); however, its high efficacy in inoperable and metastatic GIST patients was later shown using FDG-PET (7, 9).
PET is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool and when used with
FDG can inform on glucose uptake. However, due to radiation exposure, there is concern in using this approach for
long-term longitudinal studies of treated patients. In addition, FDG-PET might have limited diagnostic value for tumor
detection in brain and prostate cancers as a result of the high
glucose uptake in normal brain and the relatively low uptake
of glucose in prostate tumors (44, 45). MRSI, on the other
hand, involves no ionizing radiation and provides straightforward coregistration with anatomic images. Used with hyperpolarized substrates, 13C MRSI is emerging as a novel and
promising diagnostic tool, with the ability to detect the
metabolic fluxes of a variety of substrates (13, 23, 46, 47)
in multiple organs, including in brain and prostate cancers
(48, 49). As we have shown here, the metabolic effects of signaling inhibition can be detected by this technique when
used to monitor the metabolism of pyruvate. Detection of
metabolic changes within 2 days is comparable with the time
frame for a change in FDG uptake in imatinib-treated GIST
patients. This was predictive of therapeutic outcome and exceeded by far (weeks) the time needed to detect changes in
tumor size (9). Similarly, several weeks were required to
achieve significant growth inhibition in PC-3MM2 tumors
treated with imatinib relative to control (28); however, as
shown here, 2 days of treatment led to hyperpolarized 13C

MRSI–detectable metabolic changes, suggesting that this
method could prove predictive of clinical outcome in patients treated with various RTK inhibitors.
The metabolic effect of imatinib involved decreased production of hyperpolarized lactate. Decreased hyperpolarized
lactate was also detected in response to the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (14, 35). However, the cause of the
metabolic change is likely different due to the different mechanisms of the two drugs. Etoposide was reported to induce
apoptosis and necrosis, leading to depletion of the coenzyme
(NADH) pool and consequently to a decrease in the apparent
pyruvate-to-lactate flux through LDH (14, 35). In contrast, we
found no evidence of treatment-induced apoptosis in our
model. Similarly, whereas we have not investigated all MCTs,
we found no convincing evidence in our model for changes in
the level of MCT1, which was recently suggested as a ratelimiting step in the conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate
to lactate (34). Instead, we detected a decrease in LDH expression and a drop in LDH activity in tumor extracts in
an assay independent of tissue NADH or substrate transport
rate. Thus, our mechanistic findings reflect the difference between chemotherapy-induced cell death and signal inhibition
resulting in growth inhibition.
In addition to the metabolic effect, imatinib also induced
vascular effects as shown here and in previous studies
(16, 28). We found that the metabolic and vascular effects of
PDGFR signaling inhibition are likely mediated by two transcription factors, HIF-1 and c-Myc. Both transcription factors
are induced by the PI3K/AKT pathway and possibly other
Ras- and Src-dependent signaling pathways (50, 51) downstream to RTKs. The role of HIF-1 in regulating glycolysis
and angiogenesis is well established (36) and includes control
over LDH and VEGF expression. Myc is also known for regulation of metabolism, and recent publications indicate its crucial role in developmental and tumor angiogenesis, involving
expression of VEGF and release of VEGF sequestered in the
extracellular matrix (37, 39–41). Under physiologic conditions,
HIF-1 inhibits normal Myc activity; however, Myc overexpression in tumors may overcome this inhibition such that HIF-1
and Myc cooperate to promote tumor growth (37, 39, 52).
Thus, both HIF-1 and Myc can promote glycolysis and divert
pyruvate away from the mitochondria by inducing LDH. In
addition, Myc also promotes the TCA cycle and maintains
the anaplerotic flux by inducing glutaminase expression and
glutamine metabolism (43, 53). Accordingly, we found that
glutaminase expression showed the same dependence on
PDGFR signaling and c-Myc transcriptional activity as LDH.
To summarize, we found that the metabolic consequences
of imatinib treatment in PDGFR-expressing prostate cancer
bone metastasis can be detected by monitoring the pyruvateto-lactate conversion using hyperpolarized 13C MRSI within
2 days of treatment. Our results indicate that monitoring
aerobic glycolysis using 13C MRSI with hyperpolarized pyruvate is a promising technique that could potentially detect
the molecular effect of various emerging therapies that target
cell signaling, and thus provide a radiation-free method to
longitudinally assess tumor response before detectable
changes in tumor size can be observed.
