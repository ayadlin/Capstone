BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases are limited. Patupilone
(EPO906), a blood-brain barrier–penetrating, microtubule-targeting, cytotoxic agent, has shown clinical activity in phase 1/2 studies
in patients with NSCLC. This study evaluates the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of patupilone in NSCLC brain metastases.
METHODS: Adult patients with NSCLC and confirmed progressive brain metastases received patupilone intravenously at 10 mg/m2
every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint of this multinomial 2-stage study combined early progression (EP; death or progression within 3
weeks) and progression-free survival at 9 weeks (PFS9w) to determine drug activity. RESULTS: Fifty patients with a median age of
60 years (range, 33-74 years) were enrolled; the majority were men (58%), and most had received prior therapy for brain metastases
(98%). The PFS9w rate was 36%, and the EP rate was 26%. Patupilone blood pharmacokinetic analyses showed mean areas under the
concentration-time curve from time zero to 504 hours for cycles 1 and 3 of 1544 and 1978 ng h/mL, respectively, and a mean steady
state distribution volume of 755 L/m2. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), regardless of their relation with the study drug, included
diarrhea (24%), pulmonary embolisms (8%), convulsions (4%), and peripheral neuropathy (4%). All patients discontinued the study
drug: 31 (62%) for disease progression and 13 (26%) for AEs. Twenty-five of 32 deaths were due to brain metastases. The median time
to progression and the overall survival were 3.2 and 8.8 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study of
chemotherapy for recurrent brain metastases from NSCLC. In this population, patupilone demonstrated activity in heavily treated

INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases are the most common form of adult central nervous system tumors and significantly outnumber primary
brain tumors, with the majority (40%-56%) originating from lung cancer, especially non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).1,2 Brain metastases from NSCLC are common at the initial diagnosis or within a year of presentation, but they

can occur at any time during the course of the disease.3
Standard therapies for brain metastases include symptomatic treatments (eg, corticosteroids to reduce peritumoral edema and anticonvulsants to control seizures),
surgery, whole-brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and chemotherapy.4,5 Despite aggressive treatment,
the prognosis is poor with a median overall survival (OS)
of approximately 7 months after the diagnosis6 and 4 to 5
months after brain metastasis recurrence.7-9
Although most anticancer agents are ineffective in
treating brain tumors because of an inability to cross the
blood-brain barrier, some chemotherapeutic and targeted
therapies have demonstrated modest activity in patients with
recurrent brain metastases in clinical trials.10-12 Epothilones
are blood-brain barrier–penetrating compounds that act as
antimicrotubule cytotoxic agents by promoting tubulin polymerization and inducing mitotic cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human cancer cells.13,14 Similar to taxanes,
epothilones bind b-tubulin; however, epothilones have a
higher binding affinity to this molecular target than paclitaxel or docetaxel.15 Unlike taxanes, epothilones are not substrates for the blood-brain barrier–associated multidrug
transporter P-glycoprotein, and they have been demonstrated to cross the intact blood-brain barrier in rodents.16,17
Patupilone (EPO906) is a naturally occurring epothilone B that has shown growth inhibition of intracranial
human lung tumors in preclinical studies.18 In a phase 1/
2 surgical study of recurrent glioblastoma, patients were
treated with patupilone 1 week before surgical resection,
and the concentration of patupilone was found to be 30
times higher in tumor tissue versus plasma; this clearly
demonstrated adequate tumor/brain penetration.19
Patupilone has shown some clinical activity in phase
1/2 studies in previously treated patients with metastatic
ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and NSCLC.20-22 The
purpose of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the activity
of patupilone in patients with NSCLC with brain metastases who had progressed after chemotherapy, surgery,
and/or radiation to the brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

This phase 2, open-label, single-arm, 2-stage, multicenter
study evaluated the safety and efficacy of patupilone in
patients with NSCLC with progressive brain metastases.
The protocol and all amendments were reviewed by each
site’s institutional review board. A multinomial stopping
rule was used for 2-stage enrollment, with 25 patients
expected to be enrolled during stage 1 and an additional
25 patients enrolled during stage 2.23 The decision to pro4166

ceed to stage 2 was based on both progression-free survival
at 9 weeks (PFS9w; also called response in the protocol)
and early progression (EP) as described later.
Patients

Patients who were 18 years old or older, had a World
Health Organization performance status  2 and radiographically confirmed parenchymal brain metastases from
histologically confirmed NSCLC, and had progressed after
radiotherapy, surgery, and/or chemotherapy were eligible
for this study. Patients were required to have at least 1
recurrent bidimensionally measurable intracranial lesion 
1 cm and to be on stable doses of corticosteroids and anticonvulsant agents for at least 1 week before baseline magnetic resonance imaging and/or at least 1 week before the
initiation of treatment. All patients were required to have
adequate hematologic and metabolic function. Patients
with leptomeningeal disease, extracranial disease in more
than 3 organ sites, grade 1 or higher peripheral neuropathy,
diarrhea of any grade, severe cardiac insufficiency (New
York Heart Association III or IV), any serious medical
condition, or previous exposure to epothilones were not
eligible. Patients were required to stop treatment with any
investigational agent within 4 weeks before study enrollment or with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or intracranial surgery at least 3 to 6 weeks before study entry.
All patients provided written informed consent.
Treatment and Evaluation

Patients received patupilone intravenously at 10 mg/m2 as
a 20-minute intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks
(21-day cycle) until disease progression, a satisfactory
therapeutic response (at the treating investigator’s discretion), withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Patupilone was held for grade
3 and 4 hematologic (except anemia) and nonhematologic
toxicities until they were resolved to grade 1 or lower, and
the dose of treatment was reduced by 25%. It was held for
diarrhea of any grade and grade 2 or higher neuropathy,
and the dose was reduced by 25% when the event was
resolved. Patients were discontinued from the study for
toxicity or a study interruption > 3 weeks beyond the
next scheduled dose.
Brain metastases were assessed for overall response as
defined by the Neuro-Oncology Criteria of Tumor
Response for Central Nervous System Tumors: the
response was evaluated by an assessment of target (up to 5
bidimensional, measurable, enhancing brain tumor
lesions) and nontarget lesions (additional measurable and
evaluable brain and extracranial lesions), the appearance

of new lesions, a neurologic examination scale (with scores
ranging from 12 to –2), and corticosteroid use (Table 1).
Tumors were assessed at the completion of every 3-week
cycle for the first 4 cycles, at every second cycle beyond
cycle 4, and at the end of the study by contrast-enhanced
brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Adverse events (AEs) were recorded with the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Pharmacokinetic Assessments

Blood samples were collected on day 1 immediately
before and after patupilone infusion and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24,
72, 168, 336, and 504 hours (immediately before the
next patupilone dose) during cycle 1 and cycle 3. A pharmacokinetic analysis of patupilone was performed with a
noncompartmental model. The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters included the peak and minimum drug
concentrations after infusion, the area under the
concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, the
area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to
504 hours (AUC0-s), the half-life of the terminal elimination phase, the clearance of the drug in the blood, the
drug accumulation (AUC0-s cycle 3/AUC0-s cycle 1), and
the apparent volume of the distribution in the body.
Statistical Methods

The primary endpoint was to determine the activity of
patupilone with respect to EP and PFS9w for enrolled
patients. The EP rate was defined as the proportion of
patients suffering progression or death within the first 3
weeks of the study (cycle 1). PFS9w (also called response
in the protocol) was defined as the proportion of patients
alive without progression after 9 or more weeks of study
treatment (day 1 of cycle 4 and beyond). The phase 2
multinomial stopping rule was applied to the primary
endpoint to determine measures of inactivity (response or
PFS9w rate  10%, EP rate  60%) and activity
Cancer

(response or PFS9w rate  20%, EP rate  40%) at the
end of stage 1.23 In particular, the criteria for considering
the drug effective and stopping after stage 1 (and rejecting
the inactivity hypothesis) were as follows: 2 to 4 responses
and 10 or fewer EPs, 5 responses and 11 or fewer EPs, or
6 or more responses and 14 or fewer EPs.
A sample size of 25 patients for each of the 2 stages
(total n 5 50) would yield a target power of 85% with a
10% target level of significance.
Because of the poor prognosis of these patients, 9
weeks of progression-free survival was chosen as a measure
of response, and the EP rate was given equal importance
in the multinomial approach; this limited the number of
patients required for this study.
Secondary endpoints included the overall response
rate (complete and partial responses), the time to disease
progression (TTP) and duration of stable disease of brain
metastases, OS, safety and tolerability, and patupilone
blood pharmacokinetics. TTP and OS were measured
from the start of study treatment until disease progression and death, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimate was
used for survival analysis.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 50 patients (25 during stage 1 and 25 during stage
2) were enrolled in this study from November 2005 through
July 2009 (Table 2). The median age was 60 years (range,
33-74 years), and 58% were men. A majority of the patients
had a World Health Organization performance status of
0 or 1 (90%). The time since the initial diagnosis of brain
metastases was <3 years for 78% of the patients. All patients
had received prior therapy for NSCLC, and 49 of 50 patients
had received treatment for brain metastases (Table 2).
Treatment

Patients were treated with a median of 2 cycles of the
study drug (range, 1-13 cycles) and remained on

Original Article

treatment for a median of 8 weeks (range, 3-42 weeks).
All patients discontinued the study drug: 62% for disease
progression, 26% for AEs, 8% for withdrawal of consent
due to patient preference (eg, reasons other AEs), 2% for
administrative issues, and 2% for abnormal test results.
Forty-six percent of the patients required a dose adjustment or interruption for AEs, including grade 1 to 3 diarrhea (28%), grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (4%), and
grade 2 dehydration (4%).
Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics was assessed for 28 patients at cycle
1 and for 11 patients at cycle 3 (Table 3). Patupilone
blood concentration–time profiles declined rapidly after

the 10 mg/m2 dose (Fig. 1). The mean AUC0-s values for
cycles 1 and 3 were 1544 and 1978 L/m2, respectively,
and the mean steady-state volume of distribution was 755
L/m2; this suggested an extensive distribution of patupilone to tissues. The low mean blood clearance of patupilone of approximately 7 L/h/m2, coupled with the large
steady-state volume of distribution, was consistent with
the long mean half-life of the terminal elimination phase
for patupilone of approximately 103 hours. The mean
ratio of the areas under the curve (cycle 3/cycle 1) was
approximately 0.97, and this indicated a lack of patupilone accumulation with this dosing schedule.

The primary endpoint was evaluated at the end of stage 1.
Among 25 patients, there were 7 (28%) who were
progression-free at 9 weeks, 8 (32%) with EP (progressive
disease within the first cycle), and 8 with neither PFS9w
nor EP. In 2 patients, an assessment could not be made.
This result met the statistical criteria to stop the study at
stage 1 for activity. Because there were only moderate
numbers of patients without progression at 9 weeks
(28%) and early progressors (32%), the decision was
made to continue the trial to stage 2 to obtain more information regarding the activity of patupilone in this population of NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Overall
results for stage 1 and stage 2 showed that 18 patients
were progression-free at 9 weeks (36%; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 20%-50%), and 13 (26%) had EP (95%
CI, 10%-40%; Table 4). Because the statistical boundary
for activity was crossed at the end of stage 1, there was no
intention to use formal success criteria at the end of
stage 2. Nevertheless, the result at the end of stage 2 also
crossed the statistical boundary for activity defined in the

protocol. These results indicated that patupilone is active
in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. Thirtyone patients eventually suffered disease progression in the
brain; 7 of these patients (23%) had systemic progression,
and 13 (42%) were stable systemically. The status of systemic disease at the time of progressive disease in the brain
was unknown for 11 patients. The median duration of stable disease in the brain was 72 days (range, 20-301 days).

Survival

The median follow-up was 163 days (5.4 months). The
median OS was 264 days (8.8 months; 95% CI, 158-386

Safety and AEs

All patients experienced at least 1 AE during the study
(Table 5), and 88% of the reported AEs were suspected
to be treatment-related. The most common drugrelated AEs (all grades) included diarrhea (76%), fatigue
(26%), peripheral neuropathy (20%), nausea (20%),
and dehydration (10%). Grade 3/4 AEs were reported
for 60% of the patients, and they most frequently
included diarrhea (24%), hypokalemia (8%), pulmonary embolisms (8%), dehydration (8%), and peripheral neuropathy (4%). No patient had grade 4 diarrhea
or peripheral neuropathy. Hematologic and liver function abnormalities were mostly grade 1 events, and no
grade 4 events were noted.
Serious AEs were experienced by 25 patients (50%),
of whom 20 had grade 3/4 AEs, including diarrhea
(20%), dehydration (10%), pulmonary embolisms (8%),
and convulsions (6%). The majority of the serious AEs,
other than diarrhea, were thought to be unrelated to the
study drug.

to peritonitis and pneumonia. There were no study drug–
related deaths.
Salvage Treatment

Twenty-nine of the 50 patients received no further treatment. The various salvage regimens used were pemetrexed
(4), temozolomide (3), radiation (3), surgical resection
(1), topotecan (1), erlotinib (1), irinotecan and bevacizumab (1), bevacizumab (1), and gemcitabine and carboplatin (1). There were no available data on salvage treatment
for 5 patients.
DISCUSSION
This study is the largest prospective trial of chemotherapy
for recurrent brain metastasis reported to date and is the
only study solely focusing on NSCLC. It serves as a
benchmark and provides reliable historical controls for
future trials in unselected NSCLC.
Patupilone, an epothilone B with good blood-brain
barrier penetration, was found to have some activity in a
heavily pretreated population of NSCLC patients with
brain metastases. However, it was relatively poorly tolerated, with a fourth of the patients discontinuing the drug
because of AEs. The toxicities were similar to those
demonstrated in a recently published breast cancer brain
metastasis phase 2 trial, which did not meet its primary
endpoint of 35% 3-month central nervous system
progression-free survival.24 Although the patients in our
study had relatively favorable prognostic factors in terms
of age and performance status, the majority had recurrent
brain metastases within <3 months. They did poorly
overall with a median OS of 8.8 months, which is similar
to the results of other studies.6 We did not have informa4170

tion on the number of brain metastases or extracranial metastases at the time of treatment initiation, but the
majority died of progressive brain metastases and not systemic disease. This highlights the fact that in addition to
brain-penetrating properties, there is a need to develop
agents that have improved antitumor activity. A limiting
factor other than central nervous system penetration is the
difference in blood-tumor barrier permeability. Although
the blood-tumor barrier is thought to be compromised in
brain metastases, the extent and magnitude are heterogeneous.25 This leads to variable uptake of the drug, which
may not reach cytotoxic concentrations within brain metastases. In general, the blood pharmacokinetic data for
patupilone were similar to those seen in a previously published phase 1 study.26
Several chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin,
carboplatin, vinorelbine, etoposide, and pemetrexed in
various combinations have been tried as first-line treatments in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC
with response rates of 23% to 50%, with the best results
observed in synchronous brain metastases in
chemotherapy-naive patients.27-30 However, traditional
chemotherapy has been found to be less effective in
patients who are pretreated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy,30 and only small, rare studies of NSCLC brain
metastases are available. Most of the reported experience
is derived from studies grouping recurrent brain metastases from all histologies, with outcomes of NSCLC
described as a subgroup.7,8 Temozolomide, both as a single agent and in combination, has been the most studied
agent in this setting and is associated with poor objective
response rates of 0% to 10% in patients and a TTP of up
to 3.6 months, although some studies have shown higher
rates of disease control (including stable disease)7-10,31; a
single-agent study specifically focusing on NSCLC that
allowed enrollment of brain metastasis patients was terminated early because of a lack of efficacy.31 Comparison
with our results is challenging because of the varying
response criteria32,33 and small sample sizes of previous
studies.
Molecularly targeted agents are increasingly used for
NSCLC harboring specific genetic alterations. Epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors
such as erlotinib and gefitinib have demonstrated high
response rates of more than 74% to 88% in previously

rate of 67% with a median TTP of 2.7 months in
patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers, the majority
of whom had been previously treated.36 In a retrospective
pooled analysis of phase 2 and 3 trials with crizotinib (an
anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] tyrosine kinase inhibitor) designed to evaluate outcomes of ALK-rearranged
NSCLC patients with asymptomatic, untreated brain
metastases, 9% of patients were found to have an objective response, and another 70% had stable disease.37 A
more recent phase 1/2 study of alectinib in crizotinibresistant, ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrated an objective response rate of 52% in 21 patients with brain
metastases.38 Overall, the use of this targeted therapy is
limited to the 5% to 20% of NSCLC patients with
EGFR-mutant or ALK-positive tumors, but clearly in
pretreated individuals, the median TTP is not more than
3 months.39 However, median progression-free survival
of 8 months has been seen with a combination of erlotinib and whole-brain radiotherapy, and the initial results
with alectinib appear promising.38-40
This study had several limitations. We did not have
uniform data on the status of systemic disease in several
patients. Cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics would
have been helpful for determining whether cytotoxic concentrations of patupilone were attained. We did not have
information on the molecular subtypes of the patients to
identify whether a certain group of patients fared better
than others.
In conclusion, patupilone was found to have activity
in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC, but it was
poorly tolerated. Further development of this drug for
any indication was discontinued after a recent phase 3
study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved OS
in platinum-refractory or -resistant patients with recurrent
epithelial ovarian cancer, primary fallopian tube cancer,
or primary peritoneal cancer, although the overall
response rate was higher in the patupilone arm.41
