Abstract
The mammary ducts of humans and mice are comprised of two main mammary epithelial cell (MEC) subtypes:
a surrounding layer of basal MECs and an inner layer of luminal MECs. Breast cancer subtypes show divergent
clinical behavior that may reﬂect properties inherent in their MEC compartment of origin. How the response to a
cancer-initiating genetic event is shaped by MEC subtype remains largely unexplored. Using the mouse mammary
gland, we designed organotypic three-dimensional culture models that permit challenge of discrete MEC
compartments with the same oncogenic insult. Mammary organoids were prepared from mice engineered for
compartment-restricted coexpression of oncogenic H-RASG12V together with a nuclear ﬂuorescent reporter.
Monitoring of H-RASG12V-expressing MECs during extended live cell imaging permitted visualization of Rasdriven phenotypes via video microscopy. Challenging either basal or luminal MECs with H-RASG12V drove MEC
proliferation and survival, culminating in aberrant organoid overgrowth. In each compartment, Ras activation
triggered modes of collective MEC migration and invasion that contrasted with physiologic modes used during
growth factor–initiated branching morphogenesis. Although basal and luminal Ras activation produced similar
overgrowth phenotypes, inhibitor studies revealed divergent use of Ras effector pathways. Blocking either the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase or the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway completely suppressed Ras-driven
invasion and overgrowth of basal MECs, but only modestly attenuated Ras-driven phenotypes in luminal MECs.
We show that MEC subtype deﬁnes signaling pathway dependencies downstream of Ras. Thus, cells-of-origin may
critically determine the drug sensitivity proﬁles of mammary neoplasia. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5856–66. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Mammary epithelium is comprised of 2 concentric cell
compartments that are functionally distinct. The inner luminal
mammary epithelial cell (MEC) layer harbors cells responsible
for milk production, whereas the outer basal mammary epithelial cell (MEC) layer forms a sheath of myoepithelial cells
whose contractility enables milk delivery (1). The ontogeny of
these compartments remains incompletely deﬁned. Landmark
studies showed that a small subset of basal-like MECs can give
rise to all MEC subtypes in mammary gland reconstitution
assays, suggesting a precursor-product relationship between
basal and luminal MECs (2, 3). However, recent lineage tracing
studies show that the basal and luminal MEC lineages diverge
during embryonic development, after which MECs remain
lineage-conﬁned throughout postnatal mammary development (4). Thus, the bulk of mammary gland growth, developAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Jake Gittlen Cancer Research Foundation, 2Penn

ment, and maintenance likely depends on compartmentrestricted MECs.
Distinct breast cancer subtypes have been proposed to arise
from malignant transformation of distinct MEC subtypes. It
follows that the divergent clinical behavior of breast cancer
subtypes may be attributable in part to epigenetic traits
inherited from diverse cells of origin (5). Intriguingly, distinct
MEC subsets can yield biologically distinct cancers under some
experimental conditions (6, 7). How the biology of MEC subtypes shapes the clinical behavior of descendant mammary
cancers remains elusive due to the complexity inherent in
multistep tumor progression. Recent reports caution against
assuming that breast cancers faithfully maintain biologic
features of their cells of origin. For example, both human and
mouse studies suggest that basal-type breast cancers may arise
from a luminal progenitor MEC population (8, 9), indicating
that clonal evolution can obscure lineage history.
Since clonal evolution confounds efforts to uncover MEC
subtype-speciﬁc mechanisms of transformation, we sought a
strategy that would allow discrete MEC compartments to be
challenged with a single initiating oncogenic lesion, then
monitored prospectively during the initiation of neoplastic
growth. Mammary organoids placed in 3-dimensional (3D)
culture under deﬁned media conditions retain the bilayered
architecture of the native mammary gland and remain competent to recapitulate complex developmental programs ex
vivo when stimulated with growth factors (10). Adding transgene-encoded ﬂuorescent reporters renders these organoids

Ras Effectors in Basal Versus Luminal Mammary Compartments

amenable to time-lapse imaging at single-cell resolution (11).
Illustrating the power of this methodology, live MEC monitoring during organoid branching morphogenesis revealed a novel
mode of cell migration and invasion termed multilayered
epithelial elongation (11). Whether this physiologic mode of
invasion is coopted by oncogenes to render MECs invasive
remains unknown.
To elucidate early steps in the transformation of discrete
MEC subsets, we generated mice harboring transgene combinations designed to permit MEC compartment-restricted
expression of inducible oncogenes in organoid culture. As a
test case, we chose to examine the impact of challenging
discrete MEC compartments with the same oncogenic HRASG12V allele. Though mutations in H-RAS or the closely
related K-RAS and N-RAS genes are rare in primary human
breast cancers, they are common in established breast cancer
cell lines (12) and frequently arise as cooperating lesions in
mouse breast cancer models (13–15). More importantly, a large
fraction of breast cancers harbor mutations that activate
signaling pathways linked to Ras. HER2/neu-dependent signaling lies upstream of Ras and provides a validated drug target
in more than 20% of breast cancers (16). In addition, roughly
30% of breast cancers harbor PIK3CA mutations that activate a
key effector pathway downstream of Ras (17).

Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice
Mice were housed in a barrier facility with access to water
and chow (Harlan Tekland, HT2018) ad libitum. All experimental protocols were approved by the Penn State College of
Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Committee. Transgenic mouse strains used were as follows:
tetO-H2B-eGFP (Jackson Labs), MMTV-rtTA (gift from Lewis
Chodosh, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), K5rtTA (Adam Glick, Pennsylvania State University, University
Park, PA), FVB-Tg(tetO-HRAS)65Lc (NCI Mouse Repository).
Mice were genotyped by performing PCR on tail clip-derived
genomic DNA. PCR primers are available on request. Both
Keratin-5-rtTA/TRAS/TGFP and MMTV-rtTA/TRAS/TGFP
tritransgenic mice remained healthy while Dox-na€ve, but
became ill within 24 to 48 hours of Dox treatment. This TRAS
transgene-associated morbidity precluded study of Ras-mediated phenotypes in vivo.
Mammary organoid preparation and culture
Organoids were generated from mammary tissue using
mechanical dissociation and enzymatic digestion, followed by
ﬁltration and differential centrifugation steps as described (10,
11). Pelleted organoids were resuspended in Growth Factor
Reduced Matrigel (GFR Matrigel, BD Biosciences) for plating.
Wells of an optical-grade 96-well plate were precoated with 10 uL
of GFR Matrigel underlay and permitted to set for 20 minutes at
37 C. A 45 mL suspension of organoids plus GFR-Matrigel was
placed atop the underlay and permitted to set for 30 minutes at
37 C before overlaying 200 mL of organoid culture media. Doxfree organoid culture media consisted of the following: Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media/F12 plus 2 antibiotic/antimycotic

www.aacrjournals.org

plus ITS (10 mg/mL insulin, 5.5 mg/mL transferrin, and 2 ng/mL
sodium selenite, all from Sigma). Organoid culture plates were
typically allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours in a 37 C incubator
before initiating experiments and acquiring images. Culture
media was changed every other day. Media additives and growth
factors at their typical ﬁnal concentrations were as follows: Dox
(Sigma, 1,000 ng/mL); ﬁbroblastic growth factor, basic (Sigma, 50
ng/mL in TRIS, pH ¼ 7.0); PD0325901 [Cayman Chemicals, 100
nmol/L in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); LY294002 Calbiochem, 10
umol/L, in DMSO]; Rapamycin (Rap; gift from Leonard Jefferson,
Penn State College of Medicine, 5 nmol/L in ethanol). In
experiments using inhibitors, inhibitor-free control wells were
administered equivalent doses of DMSO or ethanol carrier.
Organoid recovery for confocal microscopy was performed at
room temperature as described (10), and slides were stored at
20 C until analysis.
Microscopy
Time-lapse imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovision
Observer microscope with a 20 objective lens and an AxioCam MRM camera. Temperature was held at 37 C and CO2
concentration at 5% using a Zeiss Temp Module S, CO2 Module
S, and Heating Unit XL. Images of each organoid were acquired
every 15 minutes using a robotic stage and Axiovision Multidimensional Imaging Modules, with Time-Lapse and Mark and
Find functions. Time-lapse images were collected for up to 7
days, with images acquired and saved in 12 to 24 hour blocks.
After each daily acquisition period, the z-axis was reset to
maximize image focus.
For confocal microscopy, z-stacks were acquired using a
Leica TCS SP2 AOBS inverted stage confocal microscope with
laser lines 405, 476, and 543 (to detect nuclear GFP, Hoechst,
and rhodamine phalloidin, respectively). Images were captured
using either a 40 or a 63 objective lens.
Image and statistical analysis
To determine changes in organoid size and morphology,
wide-ﬁeld microscopy images were measured for 2-dimensional (2D) area and circularity. For area measurements, 2D
organoid borders were traced. Area and perimeter measurements were determined using Zeiss Axiovision software. Circularity is a unitless measurement of the compactness of a
shape, and ranges from 0 to 1. A perfect circle results in a
circularity of 1. Using perimeter and area measurements,
circularity was measured using the formula: 4p(area)/(perimeter)2. Statistical signiﬁcance on these measurements was
determined by using ANOVA or repeated measures ANOVA
analysis, where applicable. Individual group differences were
then determined using the Tukey–Kramer Procedure. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used when organoid area or
circularity was measured over time.
Mitotic and cell death events were quantiﬁed by tallying
events observed during frame-by-frame analysis of time-lapse
image sequences acquired between 24 and 72 hours of Dox
treatment. For statistical analysis, ANOVA analysis was performed, followed by the Tukey–Kramer Procedure for individual group differences. When only the difference between 2
groups was important, 2-tailed Student t tests were performed.

Results
First, we tested transgene combinations designed to restrict
expression of identical tet-regulated responder genes to distinct MEC compartments. For luminal-restricted expression, a
previously characterized MMTV-rtTA transactivator line was
used (18). For basal-restricted expression, we tested a Keratin5-rtTA (K5-rtTA) transactivator line (19). Each transactivator
line was crossed to a tet-O-H2BGFP (hereafter TGFP) reporter
line (20) and bitransgenic K5-rtTA/TGFP (basalGFP) and
MMTV-rtTA/TGFP (luminalGFP) offspring were identiﬁed.
Then, mammary organoids were prepared from Dox-na€ve
females, placed in 3D Matrigel culture, and subjected to live
cell imaging before and after Dox addition.
Both basalGFP and luminalGFP organoids consistently lacked
detectable GFP ﬂuorescence in the absence of Dox treatment
when visualized by wide-ﬁeld ﬂuorescent microscopy. Within
24 hours of Dox treatment, organoids of both genotypes
showed robust labeling with numerous H2BGFP-positive cells
(Fig. 1A; Videos 1 and 2). Most H2BGFP-labeled MECs resided
near the periphery of basalGFP organoids, but near the center of
luminalGFP organoids (Fig. 1A), consistent with transactivatorspeciﬁc labeling of spatially distinct MEC subsets. Similarly,
these transgene combinations enable Dox-dependent labeling
of spatially distinct MEC compartments in vivo (Mathers J.M.
and Gunther E.J., unpublished data). To better deﬁne the cell
compartments labeled by each transactivator in vitro, organoids collected at the conclusion of live cell imaging were
counterstained and visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig.

1B). Optical sections through basalGFP organoids revealed
H2BGFP-labeled cells exclusively in the outermost basal MEC
layer. By contrast, luminalGFP organoids never contained
labeled cells within this outer layer; instead, labeled cells
exclusively resided internally. Labeling was highly compartment restricted but incomplete in that each transactivator
labeled only a subset of the cells in its respective compartment.
When basalGFP and luminalGFP organoids were subjected to
extended live cell imaging with image capture every 15 minutes, nuclear H2BGFP ﬂuorescence typically permitted tracking of individual MECs over many hours of imaging (Videos 1
and 2). Moreover, frame-by-frame analysis of time-lapse videos
routinely permitted visualization of MEC mitoses and cell
death events (Fig. 1C).
To challenge discrete MEC compartments with the same
oncogenic insult, crosses were performed to introduce a tetregulated H-RASG12V transgene (ref. 21; hereafter TRAS) into
each model, yielding K5-rtTA/TRAS/TGFP (basalRAS/GFP) and
MMTV-rtTA/TRAS/TGFP (luminalRAS/GFP) tritransgenic mice.
Mammary glands derived from Dox-na€ve transgenic mice
showed normal histomorphology, and sections from transgenic mammary glands showed normal MEC compartmentalization when subjected to immunohistochemistry using basal and
luminal MEC markers (Fig. 2A). Organoids prepared from these
glands were cultured in 3D and subjected to live cell imaging as
before. In the absence of Dox treatment, basalRAS/GFP and
luminalRAS/GFP organoids lacked detectable H2BGFP label and
were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type organoids, indicating tight regulation of the responder transgenes. In contrast, Dox treatment of both basalRAS/GFP and
luminalRAS/GFP organoids triggered markedly aberrant organoid overgrowth (Fig. 2B; Videos 3 and 4). Genetic control
organoids lacking the TRAS transgene (derived from
basalGFP and luminalGFP mice) cultured in neighboring wells
underwent Dox-dependent H2BGFP labeling but lacked Rasmediated perturbations in organoid morphology and size,
showing that Dox treatment on its own did not perturb
growth.
To quantify Ras-mediated changes in organoid size and
morphology, wide-ﬁeld microscopy images of individual
organoids were acquired after 1 week of culture and subjected to software-based image analysis. Organoid size was
quantiﬁed by measuring organoid area in 2D. Organoid
morphology was quantiﬁed by using 2D measurements to
calculate circularity values indicative of organoid "roundness" (derived circularity values approach one as objects
more closely approximate a perfect circle but decline as
objects become less round, see Materials and Methods). Size
and circularity measurements for representative sets of
organoids were then compared across genotypes and Dox
treatment conditions.
For both basalRAS/GFP and luminalRAS/GFP organoids, Dox
treatment reproducibly increased size and decreased circularity in comparison to genetic and Dox-na€ve controls (Fig. 2C).
Changes occurring in luminalRAS/GFP organoids (9-fold
increase in size vs. controls; 0.46 decrease in circularity) were
modestly more pronounced than those occurring in
basalRAS/GFP organoids (6-fold increase in size; 0.31 decrease

in circularity). These differences may be attributable in part to
the luminal transactivator targeting a larger MEC population
at the outset (Fig. 1B).
To examine the cellular mechanisms of Ras-mediated overgrowth, live cell imaging videos from the ﬁrst 72 hours of Dox
treatment were viewed frame-by-frame to identify MEC mitoses and cell death events. Ras expression in either compartment markedly increased the number of cell divisions and
decreased the number of cell death events. Compared against
GFP-only genetic controls, mitoses in basalRAS/GFP and
luminalRAS/GFP organoids were elevated 20-fold and 11-fold,
respectively, whereas cell death events decreased approximately 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2D). These ﬁndings
are consistent with Ras imparting both proproliferative and
prosurvival signals in a cell autonomous manner, whether
expressed basally or luminally.
Next, Ras-driven perturbations in morphogenesis were compared with a well-deﬁned morphogenesis program triggered by
growth factor supplementation. Organoids stimulated with
Fgf2 use a mode of collective cell migration termed multilayered epithelial elongation when completing a morphogenesis
program closely akin to physiologic mammary branching (11).

www.aacrjournals.org

We conﬁrmed that Fgf2-induced multilayered epithelial elongation proceeds without basally directed MEC extensions and
protrusions and absent solitary "leader" cells at the forefront of
invasion (Fig. 3A). Moreover, MECs at sites of Fgf2-induced
branching aligned to form a smooth multicellular border at
the invasion front. By contrast, for both basalRAS/GFP and
luminalRAS/GFP organoids, Ras activation triggered focal invasion initiated by solitary leader cells, which typically extended
1 or more basal cellular protrusions into the surrounding
Matrigel (Fig. 3B). Neighboring MECs migrated behind these
leader cells, forming solid strands of invading cells. Typically,
leader cells emerged at multiple sites along the organoid
periphery, initiating numerous invasion foci and generating
an irregular organoid border. This mode of invasion was
clearly Ras initiated, as nearly all basalRAS/GFP and
luminalRAS/GFP organoids developed invasive foci during Dox
treatment, whereas both Dox-na€ve and genetic control organoids almost never did (Fig. 3C). To contrast the growth
factor-driven and Ras-driven modes of collective cell migration within the same organoid, luminalRAS/GFP organoids were
ﬁrst stimulated with Fgf2 under Dox-free conditions for 1
week, permitting branching morphogenesis. Upon subsequent

Plichta et al.

Dox addition, Ras activation triggered the formation of multiple invasive foci on each organoid, with basal cellular
protrusions and migrating leader cells evident within 24 hours
(Fig. 3D).
To determine the downstream signaling pathways engaged
during Ras-mediated MEC overgrowth, pharmacologic inhibitors of well-known Ras effector pathways were employed at
standard doses in time-lapse imaging experiments. Blockade of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade using
the MAP–ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD0325901 (PD) only
modestly suppressed Ras-driven phenotypes in both MEC
compartments (Fig. 4; Videos 5 and 6). Notably, for both
basalRAS/GFP and luminalRAS/GFP organoids, Dox-dependent
initiation of focal invasion was unimpeded by PD, and gross
organoid morphology as quantiﬁed by circularity measurements was only partially preserved. Likewise, PD only
partially suppressed overgrowth of both basalRAS/GFP and
luminalRAS/GFP organoids, in each case reducing Ras-mediated
increases in organoid size approximately 2-fold. While these
ﬁndings indicate that MAPK pathway activation contributes to

Ras-mediated phenotypes in both MEC compartments, they
underscore likely roles for additional Ras effectors in the
invasion and overgrowth of both basal and luminal MECs.
Whereas both basalRAS/GFP and luminalRAS/GFP organoids
responded similarly to MAPK pathway inhibition, outcomes
for each compartment following phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibition with LY294002 (LY) were strikingly divergent
(Fig. 5A; Videos 7 and 8). For luminalRAS/GFP organoids, LY
failed to suppress Ras-initiated focal invasion or preserve
circularity, and partially suppressed organoid overgrowth by
reducing Ras-mediated increases in organoid size approximately 2-fold. In contrast, for basalRAS/GFP organoids, LY
completely suppressed all Ras-mediated phenotypes initiated
by Dox induction (Fig. 5A). Indeed, basalRAS/GFP organoids
treated with both Dox and LY were, by morphometry, indistinguishable from Dox-na€ve controls. Notably, despite abrogating Ras-mediated overgrowth, LY treatment of Doxinduced basalRAS/GFP organoids did not prevent H2BGFP
labeling of basal MECs (Fig. 5A, lower left), showing that LY
does not act by inhibiting Dox-induced transgene expression.

Ras Effectors in Basal Versus Luminal Mammary Compartments

and luminalRAS/GFP organoids were cultured under the

indicated treatment conditions for 6 days. PD denotes MEK inhibitor PD0325901 at 100 nmol/L. Left panels depict day 6 images (10) of representative
organoids for each genotype and treatment condition (see also Videos 5 and 6). Morphometry of 2D images captured at days 0, 2, 4, and 6 were used to
determine the prevalence of focal invasion as well as the mean organoid circularity and area at each time point. Each data point reﬂects the analysis of 37 to 55
organoids. Error bars denote SEM.

To conﬁrm and extend these ﬁndings, Rap was used to
inhibit mTOR, a known downstream effector of PI3K pathway
activation (Fig. 5B). Strikingly, Rap treatment provided a close
phenocopy of LY treatment. Like LY, Rap completely suppressed all Ras-mediated phenotypes in basalRAS/GFP organoids, including overgrowth, without precluding the H2BGFP
labeling indicative of transgene induction (Fig. 5B; Videos 9 and
10). Taken together, the LY and Rap treatment outcomes show
that basal MECs, unlike their luminal counterparts, strictly
depend on PI3K/mTOR signaling during Ras-mediated invasive overgrowth.
To examine the cellular mechanisms whereby inhibitors
suppress Ras-mediated overgrowth, we again scored live cell
imaging videos from the ﬁrst 72 hours of Dox treatment to
quantify MEC fates. For both basalRAS/GFP and luminalRAS/GFP
organoids, MEK inhibition with PD yielded no discernible
changes in the frequency of mitoses and cell death events
(Fig. 6A), in keeping with the relatively modest impact of PD on
organoid morphology and size. In contrast, inhibition of PI3K/
mTOR signaling by either LY or Rap treatment altered MEC
fates in a compartment-speciﬁc manner (Fig. 6B). Whereas the
frequency of mitotic events for luminalRAS/GFP organoids was
unchanged by LY and reduced only modestly by Rap (38%
reduction), mitoses in basalRAS/GFP organoids were reduced 3fold by each inhibitor (Fig. 6B, left). Neither LY nor Rap
treatment changed the frequency of cell death events in
luminalRAS/GFP organoids. Interestingly, although both LY and
Rap completely suppressed Ras-mediated phenotypes in
basalRAS/GFP organoids, LY increased the number of MEC death
events 8-fold whereas Rap treatment yielded no detectable
change (Fig. 6B, right). Thus, treatments that suppressed

www.aacrjournals.org

invasive overgrowth of basal MECs consistently decreased cell
proliferation but variably impacted cell death. These ﬁndings
suggest that proliferation arrest may be the primary means by
which PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition counters the Ras-mediated overgrowth of basal MECs.
In our inhibitor studies, treatment conditions that robustly
suppressed Ras-driven increases in organoid size also preserved gross organoid morphology by preventing focal invasion. As disruptions in cell polarity and tissue architecture
promote mammary tumorigenesis (22), we examined whether
treatments that abrogate Ras-driven invasion and overgrowth
also preserve the organization of MEC compartments. Organoids collected at the conclusion of inhibitor experiments were
counterstained and visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig.
6C). Examination of optical sections from basalRAS/GFP and
luminalRAS/GFP organoids after 6 days of Dox treatment in the
absence of inhibitors revealed H2BGFP-labeled MECs dispersed throughout both the periphery and center of organoids,
indicating Ras-driven loss of MEC compartmentalization. For
basalRAS/GFP organoids, when either LY or Rap was coadministered with Dox, PI3K/mTOR inhibition not only blocked
overgrowth but also preserved MEC compartments, since
H2BGFP-labeled cells continued to reside exclusively in the
outermost MEC layer. These ﬁndings link Ras-driven organoid
overgrowth to a breakdown in MEC compartmentalization.
Next, we considered whether the failure to block Ras-driven
overgrowth of luminal MECs with PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors might be a trivial consequence of achieving higher
levels of Ras pathway activation using our luminal transactivator. To test this possibility, both luminalRAS/GFP and
basalRAS/GFP organoids were treated for 7 days with a range

of Dox doses designed to drive varying levels of TRAS transgene
expression. In pilot experiments, no changes in organoid size or
morphology were apparent below a threshold Dox dose of 25 to
50 ng/mL (data not shown). Escalating Dox doses beyond this
threshold yielded monotonic increases in organoid size up to
1,000 ng/mL, indicating graded responses to a dynamic range
of Ras activation levels (Fig. 7A). For basalRAS/GFP organoids, LY
treatment completely abrogated Ras-mediated size increases
over the full range of Ras activation levels tested. By contrast,
for luminalRAS/GFP organoids, LY treatment reduced Ras-mediated size increases by a ﬁxed proportion (approximately 2-fold)
at each of the 3 Dox treatment doses tested (Fig. 7A). Notably,

LY treatment only partially blocked Ras-mediated overgrowth
of luminalRAS/GFP organoids when coadministered with lower
Dox doses that yielded submaximal size increases in the
absence of inhibitor. Thus, even in the context of submaximal
Ras pathway activation, LY only partially suppressed overgrowth of luminal MECs.
Finally, we tested whether higher doses of Pi3k/mTOR
pathway inhibitors would sufﬁce to abrogate Ras-driven overgrowth of luminal MECs. Neither a 2.5-fold increase in LY dose
(from 10 to 25 ng/mL) nor a 4-fold increase in Rap dose (from 5
to 20 nmol/L) abrogated Ras-driven overgrowth of
luminalRAS/GFP organoids (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, MEC toxicity

Discussion
Numerous studies have explored how different cell subsets
within a tissue respond to long-term challenge with activated
Ras alleles. For example, directing expression of H-RASG12V
transgenes to distinct skin compartments yielded models with
markedly different rates of tumor onset and progression (23).
Furthermore, some, but not all, skin compartments gave rise to
tumors after undergoing cre-mediated activation of a latent KRasG12D allele (24, 25). Similarly, activation of latent K-Ras
alleles in distinct cell compartments within the pancreas drove
tumorigenesis with different rates of onset and different
requirements for cooperating tissue injury (26–28). By comparison, the short-term impact of cell type on Ras-initiated
phenotypes remains largely unexplored.
Challenging basal or luminal MECs with the same oncogenic
H-RASG12V allele triggered an MEC invasion program that

www.aacrjournals.org

differed markedly from the growth factor-initiated invasion
program previously shown to recapitulate branching morphogenesis in 3D culture (11). The speciﬁc signaling events that
lead to focal invasion upon H-RASG12V expression rather than
multilayered epithelial elongation remain unclear. Mammary
organoids engage known Ras effectors, including the MAPK
pathway, when stimulated with growth factors (10), raising the
possibility that focal invasion involves activating these same
pathways to supraphysiologic levels. Alternatively, focal invasion may result from engaging Ras effector pathways in the
wrong MECs or at the wrong time. The precise MEC subset that
normally responds to ﬁbroblast growth factor stimulation
during branching morphogenesis remains undeﬁned and may
not be targeted by the transactivators employed in our study.
Furthermore, proper initiation of the branching morphogenesis program may depend upon a speciﬁc duration of Ras
pathway activation, as suggested by others (10).
Previous studies have examined links between Ras effector
pathways and MEC invasion. When an inducible Raf construct
was used to activate the MAP kinase cascade selectively, the
MCF-10A line of immortalized human MECs acquired only a

noninvasive mode of motility (29), suggesting that invasion
requires input from another Ras effector pathway. However,
MCF-10A cells engineered to express breast cancer-associated
PIK3CA mutations acquired the capacity for growth factorindependent proliferation, but not invasion (30, 31). Thus, PI3K
pathway activation by itself may be necessary but insufﬁcient
to confer invasiveness, as others have suggested based on
studies performed on epithelial cell monolayers (32). Our study
extends this paradigm in 2 ways. First, we show that the Ras
effectors required for invasion and overgrowth differ for distinct MEC compartments. Second, we show that MEC invasion
and overgrowth are closely correlated phenotypes. In our
inhibitor studies, treatments that suppressed focal MEC invasion and preserved MEC compartment boundaries also robustly suppressed Ras-mediated overgrowth. These ﬁndings add to
the accumulating evidence that maintaining proper mammary
tissue architecture potently suppresses neoplasia.
Why do basal MECs uniquely require PI3K/mTOR signaling
for Ras-mediated invasion and overgrowth? The answer may
lie in the distinct microenvironments encountered by basal
and luminal MECs. Unlike their luminal counterparts, basal
MECs reside in direct contact with the extracellular matrix.
Recent studies suggest that matrix attachment provides MCF10A cells with critical cues that promote nutrient uptake and
survival (33). For basal MECs, Ras-driven activation of PI3K/
mTOR signaling may substitute for growth signals lost upon
matrix detachment, thereby enabling aberrant compartment
egress and expansion. Ras-mediated invasion of basal MECs
may involve cell nonautonomous mechanisms as well. HRASG12V has been shown to render epithelial cells invasive
only when neighboring cells lack mutant Ras, suggesting that
invasion can depend on promigratory interactions between
mutant and wild-type cells (32). Our ﬁndings do not preclude
roles for additional Ras effectors, such as the Ral/GDS pathway,
in MEC overgrowth.
Some studies suggest that exogenous mutant Ras alleles
yield more extreme phenotypes than corresponding mutations
affecting endogenous Ras alleles. Retroviral transduction of

5864

Cancer Res; 72(22) November 15, 2012

K-RasG12V into either MCF-10A cells or human telomerase
reverse transcriptase-immortalized human MECs triggered
fulminant invasion and overgrowth in 3D culture, whereas
clones carrying K-RasG12V alleles generated by gene targeting
showed morphology and growth that were nearly indistinguishable from wild-type (34). It is unknown whether these
discrepancies primarily reﬂect quantitative or qualitative
changes in the signaling events downstream of Ras. Supporting
the importance of signaling intensity, strong selective pressure
favors increased expression of mutant Ras alleles during the
progression of both skin and mammary tumors in mice (35, 36).
Likewise, human tumor cell lines often selectively overexpress
endogenous mutant Ras alleles (34). Therefore, the transgenemediated Ras pathway activation employed in our study may
more closely model a scenario in which mutant Ras activity has
been augmented by a secondary genetic event, such as copy
number gain.
Chronic expression of activated H-RAS alleles in luminal
MECs can drive mammary tumorigenesis in transgenic mouse
models (35), whereas the fate of basal MECs similarly challenged remains unknown. Recent studies suggest that basal
MECs may infrequently serve as cells-of-origin for highly
prevalent breast cancer subtypes. Initiating transformation of
luminal MECs from mice (ref. 9; via conditional Brca1 deletion)
and from humans (ref. 7; via retroviral transduction) yielded
tumors that resembled basal-like ductal carcinomas, a breast
cancer subtype commonly encountered in the clinic. By contrast, transformation of basal MECs using identical protocols
yielded tumors that resembled extremely rare breast cancer
subtypes, namely, adenomyoepitheliomas and metaplastic
carcinomas. It will be valuable to conﬁrm these ﬁndings using
models that permit tracing of MEC lineages in situ during
oncogene challenge and tumor progression (5). Toward this
end, we are developing in vivo methods that build upon those
described in this report.
Our studies explore signaling dependencies in the immediate aftermath of an initiating oncogenic event. In contrast,
mammary tumorigenesis in mice and humans likely requires

the step-wise acquisition of cooperating genetic lesions over
months to years. This protracted course leaves ample opportunity for signaling dependencies to change during clonal
evolution. However, a recurring theme in molecular oncology is the remarkable degree to which signaling pathway
dependencies can remain in force over time, manifesting as
oncogene addiction or lineage addiction (37, 38). We ﬁnd
that, at the initiation stage of MEC transformation, signaling
pathway dependencies can be profoundly shaped by MEC
subtype. It will be important to determine whether compartment-deﬁned signaling dependencies persist during
tumor progression.
