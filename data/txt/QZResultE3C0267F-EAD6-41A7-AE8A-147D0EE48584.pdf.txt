Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Homologous recombination (HR), a mechanism to accurately repair DNA in normal cells, is
deregulated in cancer. Elevated/deregulated HR is implicated in genomic instability and telomere
maintenance, which are critical lifelines of cancer cells. We have previously shown that HR
activity is elevated and significantly contributes to genomic instability in BAC. The purpose of
this study was to evaluate therapeutic potential of HR inhibition, alone and in combination with
telomerase inhibition, in BAC. We demonstrate that telomerase inhibition in BAC cells increases
HR activity, RAD51 expression, and association of RAD51 to telomeres. Suppression of HR leads
to shorter telomeres as well as markedly reduced genomic instability in BAC cells over time.
Combination of HR suppression (whether transgenic or chemical) with telomerase inhibition,
causes a significant increase in telomere attrition and apoptotic death in all BAC cell lines tested,
relative to either treatment alone. A subset of treated cells also stain positive for β-galactosidase,
indicating senescence. The combined treatment is also associated with decline in S-phase and a
strong G2/M arrest, indicating massive telomere attrition. In a subcutaneous tumor model, the
combined treatment resulted in the smallest tumors, which were even smaller (P=0.001) than those
resulted from either treatment alone. Even the tumors removed from these mice had significantly
reduced telomeres and evidence of apoptosis. We therefore conclude that although telomeres are
elongated by telomerase, elevated RAD51/HR assist in their maintenance/stabilization in BAC

cells. Telomerase inhibitor prevents telomere elongation but induces RAD51/HR, which
contribute to telomere maintenance/stabilization and prevention of apoptosis, reducing the efficacy
of treatment. Combining HR inhibition with telomerase, makes telomeres more vulnerable to
degradation and significantly increases/expedites their attrition, leading to apoptosis. We therefore
demonstrate that a therapy, targeting HR and telomerase, has potential to prevent both the tumor
growth and genomic evolution in BAC.

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

DNA at the end of each chromosome in eukaryotic cells is comprised of multiple copies of
TTAGGG sequence1–3 which fold into a looped conformation4 and associate with specific
proteins including TRF2 and TRF14, 5 to form a protective structure called, Telomere.
Telomeres prevent chromosomal ends from undergoing unnecessary repair and/or
recombination, interchromosomal fusion through end-joining, and protect them from
degradation by nucleases6. Thus, telomeres play an important role in maintaining genomic
integrity in a cell7–10. The DNA replication system, including that in human, is unable to
replicate the portion of telomeric DNA occupied by RNA primers. This leads to loss of a
small portion of telomeric DNA with each cell division. Rate of telomere attrition, which
may vary with age and lifestyle factors11, has been estimated to be in the range of 50–100
base pairs per replicative cycle12. When the median length of telomeric DNA is reduced
below a certain limit, the cell undergoes replicative senescence and/or apoptotic death13–17.
Telomere length may, therefore, indicate the lifespan of cells in culture18. It has also been
proposed that leucocytes may be used to estimate rate of telomere shortening and pace of
aging in human subjects11.

Author Manuscript

Although the length of telomeric DNA is reduced with cell division in most somatic cells, it
is maintained in germline and certain other cell types including hematopoietic stem and
gastrointestinal epithelial cells. The length of telomeric DNA in these cells is maintained by
addition of TTAGGG repeats to telomeres by an enzyme, telomerase or also known as
human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)19. Telomerase is inactive in most normal
somatic cells but active in the cells mentioned above. Telomerase is also activated during
oncogenesis in >90% of cases20–22. Since activation of telomerase is believed to occur at or
near crisis, the telomeres in most cancer cells are significantly shorter than those in normal
cells but their further attrition is prevented by telomerase-mediated addition of
telomeres23, 24, which confers unlimited proliferation to these cells25–27. Since telomerase
activity is elevated in most cancers but repressed in most normal cells, whereas telomere
length is significantly shorter in cancer relative to normal cells28, 29, it has been proposed
that inhibitors of telomerase may inhibit proliferation of cancer cells while having little or
no effect on normal cells. Consistently, a variety of agents with ability to inhibit telomerase
activity have been evaluated in vitro and in animal models against a number of cancer
types30–34. We also evaluated and demonstrated the efficacy of a variety of agents in human

multiple myeloma and BAC cells; these agents included small molecules interacting with Gquadruplex structures of DNA14, 29, 35, DNA or PNA (peptide nucleic acid) oligonucleotides
targeting hTR16, 36, 37, and siRNAs designed against hTERT13. GRN163L, a lipid-attached
oligonucleotide targeting RNA component of telomerase (hTR) is the first telomerase
inhibitor suited for in vivo delivery and is currently in clinical trial.

Author Manuscript

Although telomerase inhibition seems to be a promising approach in fighting cancer, it is
associated with some limitations. First, the therapy starts to work only after a lag period,
which is required for telomere shortening in cancer cells. As soon as the telomeres in cancer
cells reach below critical limit, they undergo apoptotic death or replicative senescence. The
lag period depends on initial telomere length in cancer cells and probably also on other
factors such as levels of nuclease and other activities. Secondly, the presence of an alternate
pathway of telomere maintenance, also known as ALT, has also been reported. Infact,
certain immortal cell lines and a subset of cancers do not have any detectable telomerase
activity but still maintain their telomeres through ALT pathway38, 39, involving homologous
recombination (HR)-mediated telomere elongation40. The existence of both telomerase- and
HR-dependent telomere maintenance within the same cell has also been reported41.

Author Manuscript

Telomere maintenance, by telomerase and/or HR, is a lifeline of cancer cells. Effective and
relatively expeditious telomere erosion leading to replicative arrest/apoptosis of cancer cells
may require rational combinations such as those targeting telomerase and HR. We have
shown that HR is elevated in BAC42 as well as other cancer cells43 and this deregulated HR
plays a significant role in genomic instability and disease progression. Here we report a
novel and critical finding that following telomerase inhibition, HR is further elevated in
BAC cell lines, and combining inhibitors of HR (whether chemical or shRNA based) with
telomerase inhibition, significantly increases telomere attrition and apoptosis in BAC cell
lines both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore propose that inhibitors of homologous
recombination have potential to be the most rational combination for telomerase-directed
therapy, and together these drugs, would target tumor growth as well as genomic evolution
in BAC.

RESULTS
Telomerase inhibition leads to a significant increase in homologous recombination in BAC
cells

Author Manuscript

BAC cells were treated with GRN163L (2.0 µM) for 48 hrs and evaluated for HR activity,
using the luminescence-based HR assay, developed in our laboratory42. The HR activity was
increased by 71±8%, 143±21%, and 100±23% in OE33, OE19, and FLO-1 cell lines,
respectively (P=0.001–0.012; Figure 1A). To confirm the induction of HR by GRN163L,
FLO-1 cells treated with GRN163L (2.0 µM) for 48 hrs were also evaluated for HR activity,
using an alternate (fluorescence-based) HR assay (Addgene, Cambridge, MA)44as described
in Methods. Consistent with the data derived by our luminescence-based assay, the
evaluation by fluorescence-based HR assay also showed 92±3% (p=0.0089) increase in HR
activity in FLO-1 cells, following treatment with telomerase inhibitor GRN163L (Figure
1B). To further confirm the increase in HR activity following telomerase inhibition,
telomerase in FLO-1 cells was suppressed by shRNA-mediated knockdown of catalytic

subunit of telomerase (hTERT), inhibition of telomerase activity confirmed as described in
Methods (not shown), and cells evaluated for HR. Loss of telomerase by shRNA was also
associated with significant (150%) increase in HR activity (Figure 1C). Thus suppression of
telomerase by oligonucleotide or shRNA and evaluation of its impact on HR by two
different methods, indicate that telomerase inhibition in BAC cells significantly induces HR,
which may contribute to telomere maintenance.
To investigate if telomere deprotection leads to increased HR, TRF2 in FLO-1 cells was
suppressed by siRNA and suppression confirmed by Western blotting (Supplementary
Figures 1B–C). TRF2-suppressed cells were evaluated for HR by luminescence-based assay.
As shown in Figure 1D, no difference in HR activity was observed following suppression of
TRF2.

Nilotinib and RAD51-suppression significantly inhibit HR in BAC cells

Author Manuscript

To monitor the role of elevated HR in BAC, HR was suppressed either chemically by
nilotinib or transgenically by RAD51-knockdown, as reported previously42. BAC cells were
treated with nilotinib (5 µM) for 48 hrs or transduced with lentivirus-based control or
RAD51-targeting shRNAs, and evaluated for HR activity, using the luminescence-based HR
assay described above. Nilotinib inhibited HR activity by 48±7%, 46±7%, and 53±3% in
OE33, OE19 and FLO-1 cells, respectively (P; <.001–0.002; Figure 1E). Consistent with our
previous observations, RAD51-knockdown led to 47±1% reduction in HR activity in FLO-1
cells (P=0.005; Figure 1E). Similarly, the HR activity in OE33 cells was also significantly
reduced (by 60%±3%; P=<0.001) following RAD51-suppression (Figure 1E); shRNAmediated knockdown of RAD51 was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 1F). Thus
nilotinib at (5 µM) and RAD51-suppression by the specific shRNAs used in this study,
caused a significant and similar (close to 50%) reduction of HR activity in BAC cell lines
tested.
Telomerase inhibition increases association of RAD51 with telomeres

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the impact of telomerase inhibitor GRN163L on RAD51 expression and its
binding to telomeres, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. OE33 cells were
treated with telomerase and/or HR inhibitors for 48 hrs, protein-DNA complexes crosslinked, and immunoprecipitated using anti-RAD51 antibody. The DNA from these
complexes was purified and evaluated by PCR, using primers specific for telomeres and One
gene used as internal control. As shown in Figure 2A, the exposure to GRN163L was
associated with 3-fold increase in the amount of RAD51-bound telomeric DNA. This
increased binding of RAD51 to telomeres was reduced by 50% when HR inhibitor nilotinib
was added along with GRN163L (Figure 2A). In transduced cells, exposure to GRN163L
led to 89% increase in the RAD51-bound telomeric DNA (Figure 2B, column 4). Moderate
suppression of RAD51 by “R” and strong suppression by “R4” shRNAs reduced the
GRN163L-induced binding of RAD51 to telomeres by 50% and 80% respectively (Figure
2B, columns 5 and 6). These data indicate that a substantial fraction of RAD51, induced
following telomerase inhibition, associated with telomeric sequences.

HR suppression, by RAD51-knockdown, increases the efficacy of GRN163L in OE33 cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To study the impact of HR-suppression on efficacy of telomerase inhibitor, HR in OE33
cells was first inhibited by lentivirus-based shRNAs targeting RAD51. RAD51-knockdown
was confirmed by Western blotting and HR suppression by plasmid based assay (Figure 1).
The shRNA-transduced cells (control, CS; RAD51, R) were cultured in the presence of
mismatch control or GRN163L oligonucleotides for 10 days and evaluated for following
characteristics. Impact on telomerase activity: Although RAD51 suppression alone led to a
small (19±2%) decline in telomerase activity, the exposure to GRN163L led to near
complete loss of activity in both the control and RAD51-suppressed cells (Figure 3A). Cell
growth: Relative to control (CS) cells, the viability of RAD51-suppressed (R), GRN163Ltreated CS, and GRN163L-treated R cells was reduced by 34±5%, 24±6%, and 65±5%,
respectively (P<0.001–0.003; Figure 3B). Thus, inhibition of HR or telomerase,
significantly reduced proliferation rate in OE33 cells and combined treatment was associated
with a significant 41% (P=0.001) increase in cell death, relative to GRN163L used alone
(Figure 3B). Impact on telomeres: Telomere length in RAD51-suppressed (R) cells,
GRN163L-treated CS cells, and GRN163L-treated R cells was reduced by 23±4%, 69±5%
and 86±1%, respectively (P<.001–0.037) (Figure 3C), indicating that simultaneous
suppression of telomerase and HR has a significantly greater impact on telomere
maintenance (P=0.02). Impact on apoptosis: Apoptosis was detected by evaluating the
ability of cells to bind lactadherin, which interacts with phosphatidylserine exposed during
apoptosis. Control-shRNA-transduced (CS) cells, RAD51-suppressed (R) cells, GRN163Ltreated CS, and GRN163L-treated R cells had 2±1%, 11±3%, 3±3%, and 39±5% cells
undergoing apoptosis, respectively (Figure 3D). Thus, simultaneous suppression of
telomerase and HR led to a significant 36% (12-fold) increase in apoptosis (P=0.001),
relative to telomerase inhibition alone (Figure 3D). Evidence of senescence. Cells were also
evaluated for β-galactosidase staining, a marker for senescence. A subset of cells subjected
to both telomerase and HR suppression stained positive for β-galactosidase, indicating
senescence (Figure 3E). In summary these data show that when telomerase inhibition is
combined with RAD51/HR suppression, there is a significant increase in telomere attrition
leading to expedited and stronger growth arrest and senescence/apoptosis in OE33 cells.
Consistent with RAD51-knockdown, HR inhibitor “nilotinib” also increases efficacy of
GRN163L

Author Manuscript

OE33 cells, treated with mismatch control oligonucleotide, telomerase inhibitor GRN163L,
nilotinib, or combination of drugs for 19 days were evaluated for various activities. Impact
on growth and apoptosis: Whereas control cells continued to proliferate, the treatment with
nilotinib and GRN163L led to a gradual decline in live cell number leading to 59±4% and
68±3% cell death in 19 days, respectively (P<.001). However, the combination of drugs was
responsible for 90±4% cell death, significantly increased relative to control cells (P<.001)
and those treated with GRN163L alone (P=0.007) (Figure 4A). Treatment with nilotinib,
GRN163L, and combination of drugs led to apoptotic death in 27±2%, 38±1%, and 74±3%
cells, respectively (P<.001; Figure 4B). Thus, simultaneous suppression of HR and
telomerase was associated with 36% increase in apoptosis in OE33 cells, relative to
GRN163L used alone (P<.001) (Figure 4B). Impact on telomere length. Telomeres in

untreated OE33 cells are really short (~2.00 kbp) (Supplementary Figure 1D). Telomere
length in cells treated with nilotinib and GRN163L was reduced to 70±5% and 40±5% of
control cells, respectively (P=0.023 and 0.002) (Figure 4C). However, the combination of
drugs reduced telomere length to only 6±1% of control cells (P<.001), i.e., a significant
(35%) increase in telomere attrition relative to GRN163L used alone (P<.001; Figure 4C).
Impact on cell cycle. Evaluation of cell cycle by flow cytometry indicated that S-phase was
significantly reduced (P<.001) only by combination treatment, whereas G2/M arrest was
induced by all three treatments (Figure 4D). The increase in G2-arrest by combination
treatment was 5.0±0.2- and 2.4±0.1-fold higher, relative to control and GRN163L-treated
cells (P<.001), indicating that severe telomere shortening (in cells treated with both drugs)
was associated with prevention of entry into S-phase and a strong arrest in G2/M-phase of
cell cycle (Figure 4D). Impact on HR. Figure 1 shows the impact of 48 hr treatment of
BAC cells with nilotinib and GRN163L on HR. To evaluate the impact of these treatments
on HR beyond 48 hrs, the cells treated with drugs separately or together for two weeks were
evaluated for HR activity, using the plasmid based assay described previously42. As shown
in Figure 4E, nilotinib was associated with a significant suppression of HR (34±11% of
control; P=0.001), even at day 14 of treatment. Although induction of HR by GRN163L at
day 14 was not as strong as observed at 48 hrs of treatment, it was still 30±4% higher,
relative to control cells (P=0.007). Addition of nilotinib along with GRN163L, kept the level
of HR as low as in the cells treated with nilotinib alone (Figure 4E).

Author Manuscript

To extend the observations made in OE33 cells to other cell lines, HR was also suppressed
(chemically or transgenically) in OE19 and FLO-1 cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2).
Suppression of HR in all three cell lines (OE33, OE19, and FLO-1) led to shorter telomeres,
whereas combination of HR and telomerase suppression, caused a significant increase in
telomere attrition and apoptotic death, relative to either treatment alone. Overall these data
indicate that although telomerase inhibition disrupts telomere maintenance and inhibits cell
cycle progression and proliferation, it induces recombinase (RAD51) and HR activity, which
contribute to telomere maintenance and prevention of apoptosis. Inhibition of HR, by
transgenic or chemical manipulations, also affects above oncogenic activities and when
combined with GRN163L, keeps HR downregulated, leading to significantly increased
telomere attrition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in OE33 cells.

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that transgenically-mediated suppression of HR leads to
significant reduction in the acquisition of genomic changes over time in BAC cells42. Here
we show that chemical suppression of HR (by nilotinib) also reduces genomic instability in
BAC cells. DNA from OE33 cells, untreated or treated with nilotinib (5 µM) for three
weeks, was purified and evaluated for acquisition of genomic changes. DNA from cells
harvested and frozen at the beginning of experiment (Day 0) was used as baseline genome.
Accrual of copy number changes in cultured vs. baseline control cells throughout genome
was monitored by investigating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and CNV loci of
SNP6.0 arrays (Affymetrix), using Bioconductor and dChip softwares. Copy number
changes were reduced both in number and extent by HR inhibitor, nilotinib, throughout
genome (Supplementary Figure 3). These observations are consistent with and serve to

Impact of HR and telomerase suppression on tumor growth and telomere maintenance in
vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To investigate the effect of HR and/or telomerase suppression in a subcutaneous tumor
model of BAC, HR was inhibited either chemically by nilotinib or transgenically by RAD51
knockdown. SCID mice were divided into two subgroups. In first group, the FLO-1 cells
were injected subcutaneously and following appearance of tumors, mice treated with either
PBS, nilotinib, GRN163L, or the combination. In second group of mice, the tumors were
developed by injecting control and RAD51-suppressed FLO-1 cells, and following
appearance of tumors, mice treated with PBS or GRN163L. Relative to control mice, the
tumor size in mice treated with nilotinib, GRN163L, and the combination was reduced to
47±3%, 48±4%, and 27±6%, respectively (P<0.001–0.002; Figure 5A). In another group of
mice, tumors developed by RAD51-suppressed cells without and with GRN163L treatment
were 41±5% and 21±6% of control mice, respectively (Figure 5B). Relative to
corresponding controls, the tumor sizes resulted from nilotinib, GRN163L, and RAD51suppression were not significantly different, whereas simultaneous suppression of
telomerase and HR (whether mediated chemically or transgenically) resulted in the smallest
tumor sizes, significantly smaller than control mice and those treated with GRN163L alone
(Figure 5C). Relative to control, treatment with nilotinib, GRN163L, and combination
reduced telomeres in tumor cells to 53±8%, 42±6%, and 13±3% of relative telomere length
in tumor cells derived from control mice, respectively (P=0.001–0.045; Figure 5D). Thus
simultaneous suppression of telomerase and HR led to a significant (29%; P=0.006) increase
in telomere shortening, compared to GRN163L alone, in vivo. Simultaneous suppression of
telomerase and HR was also associated with ~40% of tumor cells undergoing apoptosis,
whereas only 10% of cells had evidence of apoptosis in tumors derived from control mice
(Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that telomerase activity is elevated and inhibition of telomerase
by GRN163L induces growth arrest and apoptosis in BAC cells17. Telomerase is believed to
get activated at or near crisis. Telomeres in most cancer cells are therefore significantly
shorter than those in normal cells, but their further shortening is prevented by telomerasemediated elongation of telomeres23, 24. The fact that telomeres are shorter28, 29 whereas
telomerase activity is elevated in most cancer cells20–22 and confers unlimited proliferation
potential25–27, makes telomerase a relatively specific and ideal target to inhibit proliferation
of cancer cells. Consistent with this, telomerase inhibition achieved by various methods/
agents, has been shown to induce growth arrest and senescence and/or apoptosis in a number
cancer cell types13, 14, 30–34, 37, 45, 46. However, cell death following telomerase inhibition
mostly occurs after a lag period of few weeks, required for telomere shortening below
critical length13, 14, 35–37, 46. The requirement of this lag period makes telomerase a
somewhat less favorable target, especially for aggressively proliferating cancer cells.
Moreover, there is always a possibility that cancer cells exposed to telomerase inhibitor for

relatively longer time periods, may activate alternate pathway of telomere elongation,
involving homologous recombination (HR)40. Although rarely, but exposure to telomerase
inhibitor has led to development of resistance to therapy in certain cancer cell lines
(unpublished data from our laboratory). Identification of agents/strategies which may
significantly expedite telomere erosion by telomerase inhibitors, can provide novel cancer
treatments which may prove to be more effective and less toxic than currently used
chemotherapeutics.

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that HR activity is spontaneously elevated and contributes to
genomic instability in BAC42. Here, we report a novel and important finding that inhibition
of telomerase leads to a further increase in HR activity, in all BAC cell lines tested. The
induction of HR, following suppression of telomerase by GRN163L, was confirmed by two
different methods. Additionally, the suppression of telomerase by shRNA was also
associated with increased HR activity in BAC cells. The mechanism of increased HR in
BAC cells, following inhibition of telomerease activity, is currently under investigation in
our laboratory (manuscript in preparation). Our previous data also show that suppression of
elevated HR by RAD51-knockdown, significantly reduces acquisition of genomic changes
in BAC cells42. In an effort to search for a chemical inhibitor of HR, we have identified that
nilotinib which targets ABL tyrosine kinase, one of the key signaling molecules implicated
in HR47, significantly reduces HR activity in a variety of cancer cell lines. Consistent with
transgenic suppression of HR, we show that HR suppression by nilotinib also reduces
genomic instability in BAC cells.

Author Manuscript

Elevated HR has also been implicated in telomere maintenance through ALT mechanism40.
Telomerase inhibitor, GRN163L, binds to template region of RNA subunit of telomerase
and acts as a competitive substrate inhibitor, preventing both the binding to telomerase and
the extension process. If, however, telomeric substrate is pre-bound to telomerase,
GRN163L may not replace it from the enzyme, at least during one cycle of elongation48. We
therefore hypothesized that telomeric ends in BAC cells are mostly occupied by telomerase
and relatively inaccessible to RAD51, whereas treatment with GRN163L exposes them for
RAD51 to bind. This is consistent with our chip data demonstrating that telomerase
inhibition increases RAD51 expression and its association with telomeres.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the impact of HR suppression, alone or in combination with GRN163L, HR was
inhibited either chemically or transgenically (by RAD51-knockdown). Consistent with our
previous observations42, lentiviral shRNA-mediated suppression of RAD51 led to
significant reduction in HR activity. We also demonstrated for the first time that nilotinib, a
BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, consistently reduces HR activity in BAC (Figure 1) and
other cancer cell lines tested by us (not shown). The reduction in HR activity by nilotinib at
the dose used in this study was similar as that observed by RAD51-suppression. Suppression
of HR, by either method, was associated with telomere shortening (by 23–58%) in all BAC
cell lines tested, indicating that besides telomerase, elevated RAD51 and HR also participate
in telomere maintenance in these cells, probably by repair/stabilization of eroding telomeres.
The increased association of RAD51 to telomeres following telomerase inhibition, could
also contribute to telomere stabilization by making them relatively inaccessible to
degradation machinery. Since induction of HR following telomerase inhibition was not

associated with lengthening of telomeres, it is clear that maintenance of telomeres by
RAD51/HR in BAC cells is not associated with any significant increase in their length.
Although recombination is usually associated with production of long heterogenous
telomeres49, 50, it has been reported that in yeast, the maintenance of telomeres by
recombination can also be accomplished through pathways which do not lead to a significant
increase in telomere length51. Our data therefore indicate that elevated HR/RAD51 in BAC
cells contribute to telomere maintenance/stabilization, providing support to telomerase. In
the presence of telomerase inhibitor, HR is further induced to stabilize telomeres, but the
absence of continued elongation (by telomerase) leads to gradual telomere shortening.
Occasionally the induced HR succeeds in elongating telomeres, leading to development of
resistance to telomerase-inhibition (unpublished data from our laboratory). Consistent with
this, the suppression of HR significantly increased the efficacy of telomerase inhibitor
(GRN163L), leading to a stronger telomere reduction and an expeditious growth arrest and
apoptotic death in BAC cells. Combined treatment was also associated with a strong G2/M
arrest and senescence, as detected by β-galactosidase staining. Simultaneous suppression of
HR and telomerase, in different experiments and cell lines, was associated with 82–94%
reduction in median telomere length relative to control cells; the telomeres were
significantly smaller than even the cells treated with GRN163L alone (P value range; 0.02–
<0.001). The production of smallest telomeres and induction of G2/M arrest by combined
treatment in this study are consistent with the observations in yeast showing that extensive
telomere shortening induces G2/M arrest52. Moreover, it has been shown that key HR
protein RAD51, loaded onto telomeres by BRCA2, significantly contributes to the integrity
of telomeric DNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts53. This further supports our data
demonstrating a significant increase in telomere attrition and apoptosis in BAC cells by
simultaneous suppression of telomerase and RAD51/HR.

Since telomeres on individual chromosomes are heterogeneous in size and the heterogeneity
may be more extensive in cancer cells, the chromosomes with extremely small telomeres are
eroded and lost much faster than those with very long telomeres, and erosion of even one or
more critical chromosomes may be enough to inhibit cell growth. Infact the length of the
smallest telomere is a major determining factor for initiation of senescence in a cell54.
Therefore, additional reduction in median telomere length, as seen by combination
treatment, is expected to significantly expedite senescence and/or apoptosis. A large
telomere reduction in BAC cells following suppression of telomerase and HR activities, over
a shorter period of time, could be attributed to several factors, including proliferation rate
(doubling time ranging from 18–24 hrs), initial telomere length, and intracellular levels of
nucleases etc. For example, mean TRF in OE33, being ~2.0 kbp (Supplementary Figure
1D), is very close to the minimum telomere length required for continued survival of human
cells12; thus any additional reduction is expected to cause a rapid loss of telomeres.
However, our data does not rule out the possibility that besides impact on telomere
shortening, RAD51-suppression and nilotinib may also have other anticancer activities,
contributing to increased and expeditious growth arrest.
In summary, this manuscript is the first illustration that: 1) Inhibition of telomerase induces
homologous recombination (HR) activity and recombinase (RAD51) in BAC cells; 2) HR
contributes to telomere maintenance in telomerase positive human cells without significantly

increasing their length; 3) Identifies nilotinib as HR inhibitor; 4) and demonstrates a marked
inhibition of genomic instability by nilotinib, a chemical inhibitor of HR, in BAC cells. We
also show that inhibition of telomerase increases the association of RAD51 with telomeres
in BAC cells. The induced RAD51/HR and association of RAD51 with telomeres contribute
to prevention of telomere attrition and apoptosis. Simultaneous suppression of HR and
telomerase, significantly increases telomere attrition, leading to G2M arrest, senescence
and/or apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Combination of GRN163L with transgenic and
chemical suppression of HR was associated with the smallest tumor sizes, which were 73%
and 79% smaller relative to tumors in control mice, respectively (P=0.001). Since HR is
implicated in telomere maintenance and genomic instability, it may contribute to survival of
cancer cells through these and probably other roles as well. We are currently using a high
throughput assay to screen a library of 300,000 small molecules to identify more specific
and potent inhibitors of HR, to target genomic instability and telomere maintenance. A
therapeutic strategy, targeting HR and telomerase, has potential to prevent both the tumor
growth and genomic evolution in BAC and probably other cancers as well, and our data
provide the preclinical rationale for clinical evaluation of HR inhibitors in BAC, in
combination with GRN163L.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, drugs, and shRNAs

Author Manuscript

Barrett’s esophageal adenocarcinoma (BAC) cell lines OE33 and OE1942, 55, 56, purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium,
supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). BAC cell line
FLO-142, 56, 57, provided by Dr. David G. Beer, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA, was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma Chemical
CO., St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were maintained in a state of
logarithmic growth at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Nilotinib (which targets
BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase), siRNA targeting TRF2, and lentivirus particles producing either
non-targeted control (CS) shRNAs and those targeting human recombinase RAD51 (RS and
RS4) or telomerase (hTERT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. RS mediates a moderate
suppression of RAD5142 whereas R4 a strong or near complete (80–100%) suppression56.
Telomerase inhibitor GRN163L, a palmitoyl (C16) lipid – attached N3’-P5’ thiophosphoramidate oligonucleotide (5’-Palm-TAGGGTTAGACAA 3’), targeting RNA
component of telomerase is synthesized at Geron Inc., Menlo Park, CA).
Cell treatments, growth kinetics, and apoptosis assays

Author Manuscript

Telomerase activity in BAC cells was suppressed by oligonucleotide GRN163L or lentivirus
based shRNA, targeting telomerase; mismatch oligonucleotide or control shRNA were used
as control. HR was reduced either chemically (by treatment with nilotinib) or transgenically
(using lentivirus-based RAD51 targeting shRNAs). For transgenic suppression of HR,
lentivirus particles, producing non-targeted control (CS) or RAD51-targeting (RS and RS4)
shRNAs were transduced into BAC cells as described previously42. The transduced cells
were selected in puromycin at concentration of 1 µg/ml for seven days and evaluated for
RAD51 suppression by Western blotting. To evaluate the impact on growth, the transduced

cells were cultured in the presence of GRN163L or mismatch control oligonucleotide. In
another set of experiments, BAC cells were treated with nilotinib and GRN163L, either
alone or in combination. For all growth kinetics experiments, the untreated and treated cells
were plated in triplicate at constant number and cultured for various durations. Cells were
harvested at indicated time points, viability assessed by counting the number of attached
cells, and confirmed by trypan blue exclusion and MTT assays. Aliquots of cells were
collected for various analyses and the remaining cells replated in new flasks at the same cell
number and at drug concentration/s.

Apoptotic cells were detected by their ability to bind lactadherin, which interacts with
phosphatidylserine exposed during early apoptosis, as reported previously58. Briefly, the cell
samples were incubated in dark with FITC-labeled lactadherin (Haematologic Technologies,
Inc.) at RT for 10 minutes. Cells were then centrifuged at RT and the pellets resuspended
gently in Tyrode solution (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 0.42 mM
NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 5 mM HEPES, 0.35% bovine
serum albumin; pH adjusted to 7.4 with 1.5 mM CaCl2). Cells were immediately viewed and
photographed under a confocal microscope (LSM 710; Zeiss) as described previously.
Approximately 100–200 cells, representing at least five different microscopic fields, were
examined to assess the fraction of apoptotic (FITC-labeled) cells for each sample.
Western blot analyses
Protein extracts from untreated or treated BAC cells were made and processed as described
previously42,56,59. Expression of RAD51 was detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer
(Amersham Life Sciences Inc., Arlington Heights, IL, USA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays

Author Manuscript

The chip assays were performed using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay kit (USB
corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells
treated with telomerase and/or HR inhibitors for 48 hrs were harvested at 70–80%
confluence and fixed in 1% formaldehyde. After rinsing with PBS, the cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer and sonicated to fragment chromatin DNA. Pre-blocked Protein
A agarose beads were added to the supernatant, incubated on a shaker for 1 hour and
centrifuged. Anti-RAD51 antibody was added to the supernatant, samples incubated on the
shaker overnight, and then mixed with pre-blocked Protein A agarose beads. The complex
was washed sequentially with lysis buffer, high salt buffer, lithium salt buffer, and TE buffer
(pH 7.5). Elution buffer was then added to the washed beads and following 20 min
incubation, NaCl was added and beads incubated at 65°C overnight. DNA complex was
extracted using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and resuspended in TE buffer. PCR,
using primers specific to telomeres and single-copy (One gene; used as internal control)
were conducted to assess the fraction of telomeric DNA associated with RAD51.
Assay of Telomerase Activity
Telomerase activity was measured using the TRAPeze XL Telomerase Detection Kit
(Chemicon International, Inc.Temecula, CA) as described by the manufacturer and reported

by us previously13, 14, 35. Briefly, the cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer (Chemicon
International, Inc) in triplicate, mixed with TRAPeze XL reaction mix (containing
fuorescent primers), and incubated for 30 minutes at 30°C. Telomerase products were
amplified by PCR and quantitated with a fluorescence plate reader. Telomerase activity, for
each lysate, was calculated from the ratio of telomerase products to an internal standard, as
instructed by the manufacturer.
Telomere length analysis

Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA from untreated and treated cells was purified using DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen Inc.), as described by the manufacturer. A slight modification of a previously
described real-time PCR based assay was performed, using Applied Biosystems 7900HT
Thermocycler60. Average relative telomere length was presented as telomere repeat and
single-copy (One gene) copy-number (T/S) ratio, as described previously17. Briefly, the
genomic DNA in 96-well plate was resuspended in either the telomere or One gene qPCR
reaction mixtures containing corresponding primers60, in triplicate. Since PCR product is
approximately doubled in each cycle of the PCR, the T/S ratio is [2Ct(Telomeres)/
2Ct(One gene)]−1 = 2−ΔCt. The relative TS ratio (T/S of one sample relative to the T/S of
another sample) is 2−(ΔCt1−ΔCt2) = 2−ΔΔCt. Using this formula, a relative T/S ratio for each of
the 96 wells was determined, as the T/S of the well relative to the mean T/S for all 96 wells.
Standard curve was made by plotting T/S ratio of four cell lines (HTB, ARP, RPMI, U266)
for which median telomere length in kbp has been determined by gel-based analyses; TL of
samples in kbp was derived from this standard curve.
Homologous Recombination Assays

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Homologous recombination (HR) activity was assessed by two different methods, the
luminescence-based HR assay established in our laboratory42 and fluorescence-based HR
assay, available commercially (Addgene, Cambridge, MA)44. The HR substrate plasmid
developed by us contains two incomplete fragments of a firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene,
sharing a small region of homology. The Fluc fragments are separated by an AmpR gene,
serving as spacer. HR between homologous sequences of two Fluc fragments generates a
functional gene, resulting in the excision of the AmpR gene. The plasmid also has a Gaussia
luciferase (Gluc) gene which serves as an internal control and is not affected by
recombination. This plasmid is introduced into BAC cells, the cells are incubated for an
appropriate duration, harvested, and the HR is assessed from the ratio of two luciferase
activities. Fluorescence-based HR assay substrate (pDRGFP; Addgene44) is comprised of
two defective copies of GFP, separated by a drug resistance marker. One of the GFP
contains the restriction site for I-Sce I enzyme; the introduction of break at this site promotes
homology-based recombination between two mutated genes, generating a functional GFP.
FLO-1 cells stably transfected with HR substrate (Addgene), were transfected with a
plasmid expressing I-Sce I enzyme. The cells were then plated in two different flasks, one
treated with control oligonucleotide and the other with GRN163L as treated for other HR
assay and subsequently evaluated for confocal microscopy. HR was assessed from
fluorescence intensity of each microscopic field divided by total number of cells in the
corresponding field. Average background fluorescence/cells, determined from untransfected
cells, was subtracted from values of transfected cells.

Assessment of genomic instability

Author Manuscript

BAC cells were cultured in the presence or absence of nilotinib. An aliquot of cells was
harvested and frozen at the beginning of the experiment (Day 0), to be used as a reference.
The acquisition of genomic changes, relative to reference cells, was monitored by genomewide screens for copy-number alterations, using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays (Affymetrix) and dchip software as described previously42.
Senescence

Author Manuscript

One day before this assay, the treated cells were plated on Lab-Tek slides in the presence of
mismatch or match (GRN163L) oligonucleotide and the attached cells were stained for βgalactosidase expression, a marker for cellular senescence61H. Briefly, the cells were rinsed
three times with PBS and fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution in
PBS. The cells were then washed again as described above and stained overnight in solution
containing 1 mg/ml X-gal, 40 mM citric acid/sodium phosphate (pH 6), 5 mM potassium
ferrocyanide, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl2. The stain was then removed, cells were
rinsed with PBS, and staining was viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus).
Impact of HR/Telomerase suppression in a subcutaneous tumor model

Author Manuscript

Homologous recombination (HR) activity was suppressed either chemically (by nilotinib) or
transgenically (by RAD51-knockdown). Five week old male CB-17 SCID mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and maintained following
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC); all experimental
procedures were approved by the IACUC and the Occupational Health and Safety
Department of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. FLO-1 cells (3.0×106 in
100 µl saline) were injected subcutaneously into the interscapular area of each mouse.
Following appearance of palpable tumors (~7–10 days), the mice were treated with normal
saline containing working dilution of solvent DMSO, nilotinib (100 mg/kg dissolved in
DMSO, diluted in normal saline), GRN163L (40 mg/kg dissolved in normal saline), or
combination of nilotinib and GRN163L, injecting four times per week, intraperitoneally. To
evaluate if efficacy of GRN163L can be enhanced by RAD51 suppression, FLO-1 cells
transduced with control (CS) or RAD51-specific (R) shRNAs were cultured for two weeks
and then injected subcutaneously into the mice as described above. After appearance of
tumors, the mice were treated with either normal saline or GRN163L (40 mg/kg dissolved in
normal saline), injecting four times a week. Tumor sizes were measured twice a week and
animals sacrifized when tumors reached 2 cm3 in volume or when paralysis or major
compromise in their quality of life occurred.

(A) GRN163L, an oligonucleotide targeting RNA component of telomerase, induces
HR. BAC cell lines (OE33, OE19, FLO-1) were treated with mismatch control
oligonucleotide (C; 2 µM) or GRN163L (G; 2 µM) for 48 hrs, and evaluated for HR activity
using the luminescence-based HR assay described in Methods. Error bars represent SEMs of
triplicate assays. (B) Confirmation of increase in HR by alternate method. FLO-1 cells
treated as above (in panel A) were evaluated for HR activity, using a fluorescence-based HR
assay (Addgene) as described in Methods. (C) shRNA, targeting catalytic subunit of
telomerase (hTERT), also induces HR. FLO-1 cells were transduced with lentivirus
particles, producing control (CS) or telomerase-targeting (TS) shRNAs, and following
selection evaluated for HR, using luminescence-based HR assay described in Methods. (D)
Impact of TRF2 knockdown on HR. FLO-1 cells, transfected with control (CS) or TRF2
targeting (TR) siRNA, were cultured untreated or treated for 48 hrs with GRN163L (G; 2
µM), and evaluated for HR activity using the luminescence-based HR assay. (E) Inhibition
of HR by nilotinib and RAD51-suppression. BAC cell lines were exposed to nilotinib (5
µM) or transduced with lentivirus-based shRNAs (CS, control; R, RAD51-targeting).
Untreated cells (U), those treated with nilotinib for 48 hrs (N), and shRNA-transduced cells
