Abstract
Despite rapid advances in many fronts, pancreatic cancer (PC)
remains one of the most difficult human malignancies to treat
due, in part, to de novo and acquired chemoresistance and
radioresistance. Gemcitabine alone or in combination with
other conventional therapeutics is the standard of care for the
treatment of advanced PC without any significant improvement in the overall survival of patients diagnosed with this
deadly disease. Previous studies have shown that PC cells that
are gemcitabine-resistant (GR) acquired epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, which is reminiscent of
‘‘cancer stem-like cells’’; however, the molecular mechanism
that led to EMT phenotype has not been fully investigated. The
present study shows that Notch-2 and its ligand, Jagged-1, are
highly up-regulated in GR cells, which is consistent with the
role of the Notch signaling pathway in the acquisition of
EMT and cancer stem-like cell phenotype. We also found that
the down-regulation of Notch signaling was associated with
decreased invasive behavior of GR cells. Moreover, downregulation of Notch signaling by siRNA approach led to partial
reversal of the EMT phenotype, resulting in the mesenchymalepithelial transition, which was associated with decreased
expression of vimentin, ZEB1, Slug, Snail, and nuclear factorKB. These results provide molecular evidence showing that the
activation of Notch signaling is mechanistically linked with
chemoresistance phenotype (EMT phenotype) of PC cells,
suggesting that the inactivation of Notch signaling by novel
strategies could be a potential targeted therapeutic approach
for overcoming chemoresistance toward the prevention of
tumor progression and/or treatment of metastatic PC. [Cancer

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive malignant
disease, which is ranked as the fourth leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in the United States, with f37,000 newly
diagnosed cases and f34,000 deaths per year in the United
States (1). In recent years, novel treatment strategies, including
diverse cytotoxic therapeutics such as chemotherapeutic drugs,

suicide genes, g-irradiation–induced cytotoxicity, or immunotherapy have been initially encouraging, but prolonged drug
exposure results in the development of acquired drug resistance
impeding successful treatment (1). Thus, the aggressive behavior
of PC is believed to be due to both de novo (intrinsic) and
acquired (extrinsic) resistance to conventional therapeutics and
also could be due to the lack of delivery of effective doses of the
drugs in the tumor because of the existence of extensive
desmoplastic stroma and lack of adequate vasculature in most
PCs. Although gemcitabine monotherapy (2¶,2¶-difluorodeoxycytidine), a deoxycytidine analogue, or its combination with other
agents has become standard chemotherapy for the treatment of
advanced PC, gemcitabine imparts a progression-free survival
interval ranging from 0.9 to 4.2 months only (2). In summary,
the effect of gemcitabine on survival has been disappointing,
which could be due to many factors including intrinsic (de novo)
drug resistance. This disappointing outcome strongly suggests
that a better understanding of the mechanism by which
chemoresistance arises is likely to lead to novel therapeutic
strategies for the successful treatment of patients diagnosed
with PC.
Emerging lines of evidence suggest molecular and phenotypic
associations between chemoresistance and the acquisition of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)–like phenotype of cancer
cells (3–6). This process is also believed to be reminiscent of
‘‘cancer stem-like cells’’ characteristics in many cancer systems (7–
10). EMT has been classified as a unique process by which
epithelial cells undergo remarkable morphologic changes characterized by a transition from epithelial cobblestone phenotype to
elongated fibroblastic phenotype (mesenchymal phenotype) leading to increased motility and invasion (11, 12). The process of EMT
involves loss of epithelial cell-cell junction, actin cytoskeleton
reorganization, and up-regulation of mesenchymal molecular
markers such as fibronectin, a-smooth muscle actin (SMA),
vimentin, and N-cadherin (12–14). A disassembly of cell-cell
junction, including down-regulation and relocation of E-cadherin
and h-catenin from cell membrane to nucleus, results in the
induction of EMT. A number of factors that transcriptionally
repress E-cadherin have emerged as potent EMT drivers during
normal development and cancer. These include the zinc finger
Snail homologues (Snail1, Snail2/Slug, and Snail3) and several basic
helix-loop-helix factors such as Twist, ZEB1, ZEB2/SIP1, and TCF3/
E47/E12 (15). EMT is a dynamic process and is triggered by the
interplay of extracellular signals (such as collagen) and many
secreted soluble factors such as Wnt, transforming growth factor-h
(TGF-h), fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor,
hepatocyte growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factors.
Among many of these signaling pathways, the Wnt, TGF-h,

Induction of EMT in Gemcitabine-Resistant Cells

Hedgehog, Notch, and nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) signaling pathways are critical for EMT induction (12, 16).
Emerging lines of evidence also suggest that there is a molecular
link between EMT phenotype and chemoresistance or radioresistance (3–5, 9, 10). Yang and colleagues (4) reported that
oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer cells underwent EMT.
Paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells showed phenotypic
changes consistent with EMT with decreased expression of the
epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin and an increase in
mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, a-SMA, and fibronectin
(3). Moreover, tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells showed
altered morphologic characteristic of cells similar to EMT with
altered h-catenin phosphorylation (5). Recently, Rho and colleagues
(17) reported phenotypic changes such as a spindle-cell shape
and increased pseudopodia formation, suggesting that EMT was
present in the gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells, with a decrease
in the expression of E-cadherin and an increase in the expression of
vimentin, which is a mesenchymal marker. These studies clearly
provide strong evidence linking chemoresistance to EMT.
Previous studies have shown that gemcitabine-resistant (GR) PC
cells acquired EMT characteristics (18). However, the exact
mechanism for the acquisition of EMT phenotype of GR cells
remains to be elucidated. The present study shows that the Notch
signaling pathway is involved in the acquisition of EMT phenotype of
GR cells. We also found that down-regulation of Notch signaling was
associated with decreased invasive behavior of GR cells. Moreover,
down-regulation of Notch signaling led to partial reversal of the EMT
phenotype, resulting in mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),
which was associated with decreased expression of vimentin, ZEB1,
Slug, Snail, and NF-nB. These results suggest that the increased
Notch signaling is mechanistically associated with chemoresistance
and EMT characteristics of PC cells, and as such, Notch pathways
could be a novel target for the treatment of PC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human PC gemcitabine-resistant (GR) cell line originally
was derived as described earlier (18). Briefly, L3.6pl is a gemcitabinesensitive (GS) cell line, whereas GR cells are consistent with MIA Pa Ca-2
cells as confirmed by DNA finger-printing with EMT phenotype; however,
200 nmol/L of gemcitabine was used for maintaining the EMT phenotype of
GR cells during multiple passaging. These two cell lines were cultured in
MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and 1%
penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37jC unless
otherwise indicated.
Experimental reagents. Antibodies against h-catenin were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against vimentin and nestin
were purchased from Abcam. Primary antibodies for E-cadherin, Notch-1,
Notch-2, Notch-3, Notch-4, Jagged-1, Jagged-2, Dll-1, Dll-4, urokinase-type
plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, Snail, Slug,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and MMP-9 were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other secondary antibodies were
obtained from Pierce.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis for gene expression.
The total RNA from GS, GR, or siRNA-transfected GR cells was isolated
with Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy Mini Kit and RNase-free
DNase Set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
primers used in the PCR reaction are described before (19–22). The other
primers used in the PCR reaction are ZEB1 ( forward, 5¶-GCACAACCAAGTGCAGAAGA-3¶; reverse, 5¶-GCCTGGTTCAGGAGAAGATG-3¶) and
vimentin ( forward, 5¶-AGATGGCCCTTGACATTGAG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-TGGAAGAGGCAGAGAAATCC-3¶). Real-time PCR amplifications were done as
described earlier (19).

Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer by incubating for
20 min at 4jC. The protein concentration was determined using the BioRad assay system. Total proteins were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting as described
earlier (19).
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and
incubated in PBS and 10% goat serum blocking solution for 1 h. The cells
were incubated for 2 h with anti–Notch-2, anti–Notch-4, anti–Jagged-1,
anti–E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti–h-catenin, and anti–F-actin in 5% goat
serum and were analyzed as described earlier (13).
uPA activity assay. The culture medium of the GS or GR cells grown
in six-well plates was collected. After collection, the medium was spun at
800  g for 3 min at 4jC to remove cell debris. The supernatant was either
frozen at 20jC for uPA assay later or assayed immediately using
commercially available ELISA kits (American Diagnostica, Inc.).
MMP-9 activity assay. The GS or GR cells were seeded in six-well plates
and incubated at 37jC. After 24 h, the complete medium was removed and
the cells were washed with serum-free medium. The cells were then
incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h. MMP-9 activity in the medium
and cell lysate was detected by using Fluorokine E Human MMP-9 Activity
Assay Kit (R&D Systems, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Plasmids and transfections. GS and GR cells were transfected with
Notch-2 siRNA, Notch-4 siRNA, Jagged-1 siRNA, and siRNA control (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 as described
earlier (19).

Cell attachment and detachment assays. Cell attachment assay was
done as follows. GS, GR, and GR cells transfected with siRNA were seeded in
24-well plates at 5  104 per well. After 1-h incubation, unattached cells
were removed, and the attached cells were counted after trypsinization. The
data were presented as a percentage of the cells attached to the plate
compared with total cells. For cell detachment assay, the cells were seeded
in 24-well plates at 5  104 per well. After 24-h incubation, the medium was
removed and the cells were incubated with 0.05% trypsin for 3 min to
detach the cells from the culture plates. The medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum was added into the cells to inactivate the trypsin and the
detached cells were collected into tubes. The remaining cells were
incubated with 0.25% trypsin to detach all the cells and collected into
fresh tubes. The cells were counted and the data were presented as a
percentage of the detached cells to total cells.
Cell migration and invasion assays. Cell migration was assessed using
24-well inserts (BD Biosciences) with 8-Am pores according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The invasive activity of the GR siRNA transfected
cells was tested by using the BD BioCoat Tumor Invasion Assay System
(BD Biosciences) as described earlier (19).
Data analyses. Experiments presented in the figures are representative
of three or more different repetitions. The data are presented as the mean
values F SE. Comparisons between groups were evaluated by a two-tailed
Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
GR cells display morphologic changes consistent with EMT.
As shown in Fig. 1A, the GR cells displayed elongated, irregular
fibroblastoid morphology. In contrast, GS cells had a rounded
shape, typical of an epithelial cobblestone appearance, and these
cells grew in clusters. These changes in phenotype suggested
that GR cells have undergone the EMT as reported previously (18).
To further confirm whether GR cells underwent EMT, we

determined the expression of markers of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. We found that E-cadherin, h-catenin, and Twist
expression was greatly reduced in GR cells (Fig. 1B and C).
However, elevated levels of nestin, ZEB1, a-SMA, vimentin, and
fibronectin were observed in GR cells, suggesting that the
expression of these factors may be important to gemcitabineinduced EMT of PC cells.
To further confirm whether GR cells are truly EMT-like cells, we
assessed the expression and localization of E-cadherin and hcatenin using immunofluorescence staining. GR cells acquired their
elongated shape, which was consistent with h-catenin nuclear
translocation and relocation of E-cadherin from cell plasma
membrane to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2). The results from
immunostaining also indicate that GR cells had increased levels of
expression of vimentin. F-actin reorganization and a diffuse pattern
were also observed in GR cells, which were correlated with EMT
phenotype. Having confirmed that the GR cells are EMT-like cells,
we investigated the role of Notch signaling especially because
Notch signaling is known to play important roles during normal
development as well as in the process of EMT that is reminiscent of
cancer stem-like cells (23, 24).
Activation of the Notch pathway is involved in EMT in GR
cells. The Notch pathway is involved in the EMT induction during
tumor progression and converts polarized epithelial cells into
motile, invasive cells (23). To determine whether the Notch
pathway is involved in GR cells, we assessed the levels of the
Notch pathway at mRNA and protein levels by real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. GR
cells displayed an increased activation of Notch-2 and Jagged-1 at
mRNA and protein levels. Notch-4 expression was also increased in
GR cells. However, other Notch receptors and ligands were not

Induction of EMT in Gemcitabine-Resistant Cells

cells. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, compared with GS. B, Western blot analysis showing the expression of Notch pathway–related proteins. C, immunofluorescence

significantly changed (Fig. 3A and B). To further confirm whether
the Notch pathway is involved in EMT, we determined the
expression and localization of Notch-2, Notch-4, and Jagged-1
using immunofluorescence staining. We found that Notch-2 and
Notch-4 were up-regulated in nuclear compartment in GR cells.
We also found that the expression of Jagged-1 was increased in GR
cells compared with GS cells (Fig. 3C).
Notch downstream target, NF-KB, and its downstream genes
contribute to EMT characteristics. The Notch pathway has been
reported to strongly regulate NF-nB activity and induce expression
of several NF-nB subunits (25). NF-nB has been identified as a
central mediator of EMT in cancer progression (12). Therefore, we
assessed whether the expression of Notch downstream target NFnB subunit p65 is altered in GR cells or not. We found that p65 was
up-regulated in GR cells. The expressions of MMP-9, MMP-2, uPA,
and VEGF are known to be transcriptionally regulated by NF-nB
and have been reported to play important roles in tumor migration
and invasion (26). We therefore investigated whether MMP-9,
MMP-2, uPA, and VEGF correlate with the acquisition of EMT
characteristics in GR cells. Indeed, we found that both MMP-9
mRNA and protein levels were dramatically increased in the GR
cells (Fig. 4A and B). Next, we examined whether the GR cells have
increased MMP-9 activity or not. We found a dramatic increase in

www.aacrjournals.org

the activity of MMP-9 in GR cells (Fig. 4C). The uPA and uPA
receptor (uPAR) are known to regulate the MMP-9 activity in PC
(27), and our data showed that both uPA mRNA and protein levels
are significantly increased in the GR cells (Fig. 4A and B). Most
importantly, GR cells showed higher uPA activity (Fig. 4B).
However, we did not find any changes in the expression of
MMP-2 or VEGF. Our results clearly showed up-regulation of
MMP-9 and uPA in GR cells, results consistent with the upregulation of NF-nB induced by the activation of the Notch
signaling pathway. To obtain direct proof in support of the role
of Notch in EMT of GR cells, we used Notch inactivation strategies
in GR cells.
Down-regulation of Notch signaling induces reversal of EMT
to MET in GR cells. We have shown that GR cells have a fibroblastlike morphology that is typical of mesenchymal phenotype of cells
associated with the loss of epithelial markers. Therefore, to further
confirm a direct mechanistic role of Notch in GR cells containing
EMT characteristics, we decreased the expression of Notch-2 and
Jagged-1 using specific siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 5A, specific siRNAs
for Notch-2 or Jagged-1 were effective in reducing the expression of
these proteins compared with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein (used as protein loading control).
Subsequently, we assessed whether EMT phenotype was reversed in

GR cells transfected with Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs. We found
that GR cells transfected with Notch-2 or Jagged-1 siRNA displayed
round cell-like morphology 3 days after transfection (Fig. 5B).
The results from real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of
E-cadherin was significantly increased, which clearly suggests that
the down-regulation of Notch-2 or Jagged-1 expression in GR cells
results in the reversal of EMT phenotype to MET phenotype
(Fig. 5C). However, down-regulation of Notch-4 by siRNA
transfection did not show any sign of the reversal of EMT (data
not shown). We also found that the pattern of expression of
mesenchymal markers was changed in GR cells transfected with
Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs, showing a dramatic reduction in the
expression of vimentin, which is consistent with the acquisition of
MET phenotype of GR cells (Fig. 5C and D).
It is known that E-cadherin is a downstream target of ZEB1, and
that ZEB1 is a transcriptional repressor to the expression of which
that down-regulates E-cadherin, resulting in the induction of the
EMT phenotype. Therefore, we sought to assess the expression
levels of ZEB1 in GR cells. As documented in Fig. 1, the expression
of ZEB1 was increased in GR cells, consistent with up-regulation of
E-cadherin and the acquisition of EMT phenotype. We subsequently
observed that ZEB1 expression was down-regulated in GR cells
transfected with Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs (Fig. 5D). Recently,
the Notch pathway was found to up-regulate Snail and Slug
expression (24, 28). Slug is essential for Notch-mediated EMT by
repressing E-cadherin expression, which results in h-catenin
activation (24, 28). Therefore, we assessed the expression of Snail
and Slug in GR cells transfected with Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs.
As we expected, the expressions of Snail and Slug were downregulated in Notch-2 siRNA– and Jagged-1 siRNA–transfected cells
(Fig. 5D).
Next, we assessed whether the increased levels in the expression
of NF-nB in GR cells, as seen in Fig. 4, could be down-regulated in
GR cells transfected with Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs. Moreover,
because it is known that NF-nB (p65) could up-regulate ZEB1
expression, we also assessed the interrelationships among Notch-2,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

Jagged-1, NF-nB, and ZEB1 in GR cells transfected with Notch-2
and Jagged-1 siRNAs. Our results showed that the expression of NFnB (p65 protein) was down-regulated in GR cells transfected with
Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs (Fig. 5D). These results strongly
suggest that down-regulation of the Notch pathway contributes to
down-regulation of NF-nB and ZEB1, resulting in the up-regulation
of E-cadherin and the reversal of EMT phenotype to MET
phenotype.
Down-regulation of Notch signaling reduces the detachment
and attachment and inhibits the migration and invasion of
GR cells. It is well known that cell detachment from the matrix
where the tumor grows in the microenvironment and attachment
to the secondary site is the ‘‘hallmark’’ of cell migration and
invasion during metastatic process. We found that GR cells have
increased capacity for attachment and detachment (Fig. 6A).
Because the activation of Notch can lead to increased migration
and invasion, we sought to assess the ability of GR cells for
attachment and detachment and their ability for migration and
invasion when transfected with Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs. As
expected, we found that GR cells transfected with Notch-2 and
Jagged-1 siRNAs displayed decreased detachment and attachment
(Fig. 6B). More importantly, down-regulation of Notch-2 and
Jagged-1 by siRNA markedly reduced the migratory and invasive
ability of GR cells (Fig. 6C), which is consistent with the cell
attachment and detachment findings. These results clearly suggest
that down-regulation of the Notch pathway down-regulates NF-nB
and ZEB1 and consequently up-regulates E-cadherin, resulting in
the reversal of the EMT phenotype to a MET phenotype with less
cell migration and invasion characteristics.

Discussion
Despite rapid advances in the diagnostic and surgical
procedures, PC remains one of the most difficult human
malignancies to treat. This may be due to the intrinsic (de novo)
and extrinsic (therapy-induced) chemoresistant or radioresistant

behaviors of PC, and as of yet, no systemic therapy has been
proved effective in improving the overall survival of patients
diagnosed with this deadly disease (1). It is believed that both
de novo and acquired resistance to therapy could be overcome by
understanding the mechanisms by which PC becomes chemoresistant, which will improve the overall survival of patients.
Therefore, in this study, we have used a GS and a GR PC cell line
to investigate the molecular mechanism of resistance and
associated cellular behaviors. Previous studies have shown that
GR cells acquired EMT phenotype, which is reminiscent of cancer
stem-like cells, which was associated with spindle-shaped
morphology and enhanced pseudopodia formation. The GR cells
also showed decreased expression of the epithelial adhesion
molecule E-cadherin and an increase in the expression of
mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. However, the mechanism(s) governing the acquisition of EMT phenotype by GR cells
have not been fully elucidated.
Many of signaling pathways, including the Notch and NF-nB
signaling pathways, are found to be critical for EMT induction
(12, 16, 28). The activation of Notch signaling is known to
regulate the expression of its target genes and, thus, plays
important roles in growth and development, including regulation
of proliferation and apoptosis (29–31). Therefore, not surprisingly,
alterations in Notch signaling are associated with tumorigenesis
(19, 29, 30). Moreover, it has been reported that Notch is involved
in the EMT induction during tumor progression and converts
polarized epithelial cells into motile, invasive cells (24). Overexpression of Jagged-1 and Notch-1 induces the expression of Slug

and correlates with poor prognosis in various human cancers
(24). Slug is also essential for Notch-mediated EMT by repressing
E-cadherin expression, which results in h-catenin activation (24).
In addition, Niessen and colleagues (32) showed that Slug is
directly up-regulated by Notch in endothelial cells and that Slug
expression is required for Notch-mediated repression of the
vascular endothelial cadherin promoter and for promoting
migration of transformed endothelial cells. Our results are
consistent with these findings.
Recently, the Notch pathway was found to up-regulate Snail
expression by recruitment of the intracellular Notch to Snail
promoter (28). Moreover, Notch potentiates hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a recruitment to the lysyl oxidase promoter and elevates
the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of lysyl oxidase, which
stabilizes the Snail protein (28). Consistent with these findings,
we found that GR cells displayed an increased activation of Notch2 and Jagged-1 both at the mRNA and protein levels, which was
consistent with EMT characteristics of GR cells. To gain further
insight whether Notch could directly regulate the expression of the
above-mentioned epithelial marker genes, we down-regulated the
expression of Notch-2 and Jagged-1 by transfection of GR cells
with specific siRNAs. The GR cells transfected with Notch-2 and
Jagged-1 siRNAs led to an increase in the expression of E-cadherin
and reduced the expression of vimentin and ZEB1. The
expressions of Snail and Slug were also down-regulated by
Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs. Taken together, these results
suggest that the activation of Notch, Jagged-1, and ZEB1 could
mediate the induction of EMT phenotype, as observed in GR cells,

a question with respect to how the activation of Notch-2 could
regulate the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal molecular
markers and whether Notch signaling could cross-talk with other
signaling molecules critical to EMT. To answer this question, we
determined the expression of NF-nB in GR cells. The rationale was
based on the fact that Notch was reported to cross-talk with NFnB (33). Constitutive levels of Notch activity are essential to
maintain NF-nB activity in various cell types (34, 35). Recently,
Fukushima and colleagues (36) reported that Notch-2 could
enhance NF-nB transcriptional activity. Indeed, we found that the
expression of NF-nB protein (p65 subunit of NF-nB) was
significantly increased in GR cells compared with GS cells.
Moreover, the down-regulation of Notch-2 and Jagged-1 by siRNA
transfection resulted in decreased NF-nB in GR cells, suggesting a
molecular link or cross talk between Notch and NF-nB, and thus
the activation of these signaling pathways seems to be
mechanistically associated with the acquisition of EMT phenotype
of GR cells.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

The activation of NF-nB is known to play critical roles in the
processes of EMT and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (12).
Emerging evidence also suggests that the activation of NF-nB is
mechanistically linked with the processes of EMT via regulation of
the expression of a transcription factor, ZEB1, which negatively
regulates the transcription of E-cadherin, resulting in the loss of
E-cadherin in EMT-like cells (37), and our findings are consistent
with this mechanism. Although the activation of NF-nB is
associated with EMT, it is not known what downstream gene of
NF-nB is mechanistically associated with EMT. A candidate for
such a gene is MMP-9, a well-described NF-nB downstream target
gene. Thus, we assessed the role of NF-nB downstream genes in the
processes of EMT and found that MMP-9 expression and its activity
were significantly increased in GR cells, which is consistent with
the activation of Notch and NF-nB signaling. Because uPA and
uPAR are known to regulate the activity of MMP-9 activity in PC
cells (27), and uPA and its receptor (uPAR) are important genes in
the processes of tumor cell invasion and metastasis (38, 39), we
assessed the expression of uPA in our system. We found that GR
cells have higher expression of uPA, which is consistent with
previous findings (18). Therefore, our results suggest that GR cells
could potentiate aggressive behavior due, in part, to the upregulation of MMP-9 and uPA expression during the acquisition of
EMT phenotype.
Because the processes of EMT have been linked with cell
migration and invasion, we hypothesized that GR cells transfected with Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs could lead to decreased
migration and invasion compared with cells transfected with
control siRNA. We found that transfection of GR cells with
Notch-2 and Jagged-1 siRNAs significantly inhibited cell attachment and detachment, as well as cell migration and invasion.
These results are consistent with the mechanistic role of Notch
signaling in the processes of EMT and that the inactivation of
Notch signaling leads to the reversal of EMT to MET phenotype
with less invasive characteristics. Collectively, our results provide
strong evidence suggesting that the inactivation of Notch
signaling by novel therapeutic strategies could be clinically
important in overcoming drug resistance and the reversal of EMT
phenotype, which is likely to improve the overall survival of
patients diagnosed with PC.
In conclusion, our results provided, for the first time, strong
molecular evidence showing that GR cells underwent EMT partly
due to the activation of Notch signaling. Therefore, we believe that
novel strategies by which Notch signaling could be down-regulated
may become an important approach for the prevention of tumor
progression and/or treatment of invasive and metastatic PC for
which there is currently no curative therapy.
