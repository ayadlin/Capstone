BACKGROUND. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy to treat adults with localized
resectable soft-tissue sarcoma remains controversial. The objective of this systematic review was to update the 1997 meta-analysis of randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) to reassess the efficacy of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy with
respect to recurrence and survival.

METHODS. A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify RCTs of
adjuvant chemotherapy for adult patients diagnosed with localized resectable

of the studies using a modified version of the Detsky Quality Scale. The outcome
through the fixed effect or random effect model.

RESULTS. Four new eligible trials were identified allowing for a total of 18 trials
representing 1953 patients to be included in the analysis. The odds ratios (OR)
for local recurrence was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.94; P 5 .02) in
favor of chemotherapy. For distant and overall recurrence the OR was 0.67 (95%
CI 0.56-0.82; P 5 .0001) in favor of chemotherapy. In terms of survival, doxorubicin alone had an OR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.68-1.03; P 5 .09), which as not statistically
significant. However, the OR for doxorubicin combined with ifosfamide was 0.56
(95% CI, 0.36-0.85; P 5 .01) in favor of chemotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS. This updated meta-analysis confirms the marginal efficacy of
chemotherapy in localized resectable soft-tissue sarcoma with respect to local recurrence, distant recurrence, overall recurrence, and overall survival. These benefits are further improved with the addition of ifosfamide to doxorubicin-based
regimens,

arcomas of the soft tissue are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that originate in connective
tissue. Local control with wide surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation has a success rate of close to 90%.1-4 However,
approximately 40% to 50% of patients with a large (>5 cm), deep,
high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma eventually develop distant metastases, primarily in the lung.5,6 In these instances the potential for cure
drastically decreases and the 5-year survival ranges from 25% to
30% in spite of aggressive surgical management of metastases.7-9

over the past 3 decades have been limited by sample
size and varied chemotherapy regimens with discrepant results.10-17
A 1997 meta-analysis of all known randomized
clinical trials was performed based on the intentionto-treat method combining the individual trial results
(the Sarcoma Meta-analysis Collaboration, SMAC
1997).17 The outcomes of this multicenter meta-analysis indicated that doxorubicin-based chemotherapy
served to significantly improve time to local and distant recurrence, as well as overall recurrence-free
survival. Overall survival approached, but did not
reach, statistical significance with wide confidence
intervals. As such, few facilities have accepted the
treatment as a standardized procedure, and instead
opt to administer adjuvant chemotherapy on a caseby-case basis.
Within the last decade further randomized controlled trials have been published to further evaluate
the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy.18-21 In addition, the dosages of doxorubicin have been intensified and the addition of ifosfamide to the treatment
regimens has become common practice.18-21 The
objective of the current analysis was to perform a
systematic review and update the 1997 meta-analysis
with evidence from recent randomized clinical trials
to reassess the impact of chemotherapy on the survival and local, distant, and overall recurrence of
adult patients with localized resectable soft-tissue
sarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature Search
A literature review was performed on all randomized
controlled trials that assessed the impact of adjuvant
chemotherapy on soft-tissue sarcoma in adults.
Searches through the Medline and EMBASE electronic databases were conducted through April 2007,
identifying RCTs published between 1997 and April
2007. RCTs before 1997 were identified using the
SMAC meta-analysis published in that year. The reason for this was that the analysis to be performed
utilized the same inclusion and exclusion criteria
and thus the SMAC publication was deemed to be
inclusive of relevant past RCTs. Keywords employed
in the search process included: soft tissue, sarcoma,
neoplasm, chemotherapy, adjuvant, connective tissue, tumor, and cancer. These were arranged using
varying combinations of the Boolean operators
‘‘AND,’’ ‘‘NOT,’’ and ‘‘OR,’’ and the results were limited to RCTs. The literature search was further limited to articles published in English or those that had

been translated to English—all other languages were
restricted.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Only RCTs in which adult patients diagnosed with
localized, resectable soft-tissue sarcoma randomized
to a treatment group that received adjuvant chemotherapy or to a control group without chemotherapy
were included in the analysis. There was no date limitation as all RCTs published up to the search date
were eligible for review. All trials that did not follow
such a methodology were excluded. Other exclusion
criteria were studies on bone sarcomas, pediatric
populations, and patients with advanced or metastatic disease.
All studies considered were assessed by 2 independent reviewers for eligibility and quality according to the criteria of a modified version of the Detsky
Quality Scale for Randomized Controlled Trials.22
The studies included in the SMAC study were not
individually assessed by the Detsky Quality Scale
because they had met similar inclusion criteria to be
included in the previous meta-analysis. There was a
high level of agreement between the reviewers (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.94; P 5 .022). The
reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion to
achieve consensus.
Outcome Measures
The 4 outcomes that were targeted for analysis were
local recurrence, distant recurrence, overall recurrence, and overall survival. Those patients that
experienced a local recurrence were not censored in
the distant recurrence analysis or vice versa because
it was not inferred that 1 type of recurrence would
rule out the other. Overall recurrence was thus identified as the number of patients in each trial that
experienced a local recurrence, distant recurrence, or
both. Overall survival was taken to refer to the number of deaths that occurred in each trial versus the
number of patients that survived. Time-dependent
survival was not calculated due to the unavailability
of individual data points.
Evaluation of Heterogeneity
Before analyzing the data we developed hypotheses
regarding potential sources of heterogeneity in recurrence rates, ie, differences in study quality, whether
studies were published or unpublished, and whether
randomization was concealed or not. The tests of
heterogeneity using the Cochran Q statistic were
applied to evaluate the extent of variability in results

Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Soft-Tissue Sarcoma/Pervaiz et al.

between trials. This method tests the null hypothesis
that all of the apparent variability is due to chance.

Statistical Methods
The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat
basis. A meta-analysis of pooled odds ratios (ORs)
using random effect or fixed effect model was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v. 2 software (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). A random effect
model was applied when the P-value for the test of
heterogeneity was less than .10. A subgroup analysis
was done to assess the role of different chemotherapy regimen on recurrence or death. ORs, absolute
risk reduction (ARR), and hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. In addition, the number of patients needed to treat (NNT)
was calculated for each outcome to estimate the
number of patients that would need to receive treatment before reducing the risk in 1. An alpha of 0.05
as was considered a criterion for significance level.

RESULTS
Literature Search
The screening of 31,039 possible articles yielded 93
abstracts for additional review. These abstracts were
narrowed down to 12 publications obtained in full
for a more thorough appraisal. Four studies were
excluded as the samples consisted of advanced,
rather than localized, soft-tissue sarcoma patients.
Another 4 studies were review articles and thus were
ineligible for analysis. Overall, 4 RCTs found in 4 different publications met the inclusion criteria. Combining the results of these trials with the 14 RCTs
identified by the SMAC publication allowed for a
total of 18 RCTs to be incorporated into the metaanalysis (Fig. 1).
Study Characteristics
All 18 RCTs were performed on adult patients diagnosed with soft-tissue sarcoma of varying subtypes.
All of the tumors, however, were predetermined to
be localized and resectable before patients were
included in the trials. Of the 18 RCTs, 13 used a
treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin alone or
combined with other chemotherapy drugs. Doxorubicin dosage in these trials ranged from 50 to 70 mg/
m2 per cycle. The remaining 5 RCTs utilized only
doxorubicin combined with ifosfamide. In these trials
the doxorubicin dosage ranged from 50 to 90 mg/m2
per cycle and ifosfamide dosage ranged from 1500 to
5000 mg/m2 per cycle (Table 1). All of the trials compared treatment between patients assigned to local
treatment (surgery with or without radiotherapy)

Local Recurrence
Data from 17 trials including 1700 patients and 296
local recurrences were analyzed. Adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy did not significantly lower
local recurrences with an OR of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.561.01; P 5 .055) (Fig. 2). Adjuvant doxorubicin-based
chemotherapy in conjunction with ifosfamide was
found to have an OR of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.39-1.12;
P 5 .12), which was also not statistically significant
with the numbers available. However, with all studies
included in the analysis there was a significant
decrease in local recurrence and the OR was 0.73
(95% CI, 0.56-0.94; P 5 .02). The test of heterogeneity
was not significant for the above analysis (P 5 .46).
The ARR in local recurrence was 3% (95% CI, 1%-7%;
P 5 .13) for doxorubicin-based chemotherapy alone
and 4% (95% CI, 0%-7%; P 5 .04) for all studies. For
doxorubicin-based chemotherapy combined with
ifosfamide, the ARR for local recurrence was 5%
(95% CI, 1%-12%; P 5 .12). The number of patients
needed to obtain such a benefit (NNT) for all studies
was 25.
Distant Recurrence
This analysis was conducted on data from 17 trials
including 1700 patients and 553 distant recurrences.
With all studies included in the analysis there was a
significant decrease in distant recurrence, with an
OR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.56-0.82; P 5 .0001). Test of het-

erogeneity was not significant (P 5 .80). A significant
reduction in distant recurrences was also found with
both adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, with
an OR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.56-0.86; P 5 .001), and with
adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy combined
with ifosfamide, with an OR of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.410.92; P 5 .02) (Fig. 3). The ARR in distant recurrence
with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy was
9% (95% CI, 4%-14%; P 5 .0003), and 9% (95% CI,
5%-14%; P 5 .000) for all studies. The ARR was 10%
with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in
combination with ifosfamide (95% CI, 1%-19%;
P 5 .03). With all studies considered the NNT for distant recurrence was 12.

Overall Recurrence
Data from all 18 eligible trials on 1747 patients and
884 total recurrences were included in this analysis.
With combined data from all studies the risk reduction in overall recurrence was significant, with an OR
of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.56-0.82; P 5 .0001) (Fig. 4). The
test of heterogeneity was not significant (P 5 .76).
Adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy was
found to significantly reduce overall recurrence,
with an OR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.56-0.86; P 5 .0008). A
significant reduction also occurred with adjuvant

doxorubicin-based chemotherapy combined with
ifosfamide, with an OR of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.41-0.92;
P 5 .02). Adjuvant doxorubicin alone yielded a significant ARR of 9% (95% CI, 4%-15%; P 5 .0005). Studies
using doxorubicin and ifosfamide had a significant
ARR of 12% (95% CI, 3%-21%; P 5 .01). Data from all
studies yielded an ARR of 10% (95% CI, 5%-15%;
P  .001). The NNT for overall recurrence for all
studies was 10.

Survival
This analysis was conducted on 18 trials including
1953 patients and 829 deaths. Data from all trials
showed that adjuvant chemotherapy significantly
reduced the risk of death with an HR of 0.77 (95%
CI, 0.64-0.93; P 5 .01) (Fig. 5). The test of heterogeneity was not significant (P 5 .80). Adjuvant doxorubicin-based treatment resulted in a reduction in
mortality that was not significant, with an HR of 0.84
(95% CI, 0.68-1.03; P 5 .09). The studies involving
doxorubicin combined with ifosfamide, however,
showed significantly reduced mortality, with an HR
of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36-0.85; P 5 .01). The risk difference analysis showed an ARR of 5% with adjuvant
doxorubicin alone (95% CI, 6%-21%; P 5 .07), which
was not significant. With data from all trials, how-

ever, there was an ARR of 6% (95% CI, 2%-11%;
P 5 .003), or a 40% versus 46% risk of death, which
was statistically significant. Doxorubicin in combination with ifosfamide analyzed alone also had a significant ARR of 11% (95% CI, 3%-19%; P 5 .01), or a
30% versus 41% risk of death. Data from all trials
showed an NNT of 17 to prevent 1 death.

DISCUSSION
This updated meta-analysis represents the largest
study to date of pooled data from randomized controlled trials for adjuvant chemotherapy for localized
resectable soft-tissue sarcoma. Our results concur
with those of the 1997 meta-analysis in that we
found a small but definite risk reduction in local recurrence, distant recurrence, and overall recurrence
with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy (Tables 2 and
3). However, whereas the SMAC study suggested a
trend toward improved overall survival with chemotherapy, the current meta-analysis reached statistical
significance for overall survival with adjuvant chemotherapy. This new finding may be attributed to either
the larger sample size, resulting in narrower confi-

dence intervals, or to the evolution in the administration of chemotherapeutic regimens involving dose
intensification and the addition of ifosfamide to doxorubicin-based protocols.
The majority of trials in the SMAC study were
closed before it became apparent that the addition of
ifosfamide to doxorubicin-based regimens may have
a somewhat higher antitumor activity on patients
with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.23-25
As a result, only 1 of the trials in the SMAC study
involved ifosfamide in the chemotherapy arm.17 In
contrast, all 4 additional studies in the current metaanalysis included an arm with ifosfamide in addition
to doxorubicin.18-21 In a subgroup analysis for overall
survival, we found that data pooled from all studies
with only doxorubicin-based protocols did not show
a statistically significant risk reduction in overall survival, whereas data pooled from all studies did show
improvement in overall survival, with an NNT of 17
and a risk reduction of death from 46% to 40%. Doxorubicin in combination with ifosfamide resulted in
a risk reduction in death from 41% to 30%. Although
these risk reductions are statistically significant, the
decision as to whether they are clinically significant

depends on individual patient factors and chemotherapeutic risks.
The patient populations across the various studies were heterogeneous with respect to specific
soft-tissue sarcoma pathologic subtype as well as tumor location. Patient randomization normally controls for this, but can be an issue in meta-analyses,
particularly in rare disease states such as soft-tissue
sarcoma. We performed tests for heterogeneity
between studies for all endpoints and did not find
significant heterogeneity for any of the analyses,
indicating the appropriateness of data pooling for
these studies.26
The SMAC study included subgroup analyses
and concluded that the effects of chemotherapy in
reducing the risk of recurrence and death were most
significant in extremity sarcomas. The current study
did not include these analyses, as individual data
points were not available. However, subgroup analyses are currently not recommended in meta-analyses
unless the subgroup stratification was part of the original study design for all studies included. In addi-

tion, subgroup analysis in the current study would
lead to small subgroups and increase the risk of
flawed conclusions generated by chance alone.
There is accumulating evidence from retrospective studies and trials involving advanced disease
that synovial sarcoma may have better clinical
response to systemic therapies than other soft-tissue
sarcoma subtypes.24,27,28 Whether this is related to
tumor biology, location, or younger peak incidence
and better compliance with chemotherapeutic regimens is unknown. The current study could not
assess the efficacy of chemotherapy in this subgroup
given the absence of individual data points, whereas
the subgroup analysis of 155 synovial sarcomas in
the SMAC study did not show a statistical improvement in survival with adjuvant chemotherapy (OR
0.85, 95% CI 0.53, 1.35). It is possible that with the
addition of ifosfamide in the recent trials greater efficacy could be identified.
The ability of the current study to build on the
results of the SMAC study and narrow the confidence
intervals would enable physicians to fully appreciate

Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Soft-Tissue Sarcoma/Pervaiz et al.

the potential benefit of systemic therapy in this
patient population. In rare diseases we continue to
be challenged by the heterogeneity of tissue types
seen in soft-tissue sarcoma, and currently limited
evidence regarding their respective individual clinical
responses to doxorubicin- and ifosfamide-based therapy. Meeting this challenge will be paramount as we
move forward in delineating further strategies in the
