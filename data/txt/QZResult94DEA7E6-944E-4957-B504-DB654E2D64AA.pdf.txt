ABSTRACT
We tested the antitumor efficacy of mTOR catalytic site inhibitor MLN0128
in models with intrinsic or acquired rapamycin-resistance. Cell lines that were
intrinsically rapamycin-resistant as well as those that were intrinsically rapamycinsensitive were sensitive to MLN0128 in vitro. MLN0128 inhibited both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 signaling, with more robust inhibition of downstream 4E-BP1 phosphorylation
and cap-dependent translation compared to rapamycin in vitro. Rapamycin-sensitive
BT474 cell line acquired rapamycin resistance (BT474 RR) with prolonged rapamycin
treatment in vitro. This cell line acquired an mTOR mutation (S2035F) in the FKBP12rapamycin binding domain; mTORC1 signaling was not inhibited by rapalogs but
was inhibited by MLN0128. In BT474 RR cells, MLN0128 had significantly higher
growth inhibition compared to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate
that MLN0128 may be effective in tumors with intrinsic as well as acquired rapalog
resistance. mTOR mutations are a mechanism of acquired resistance in vitro; the
clinical relevance of this observation needs to be further evaluated.

INTRODUCTION

angiogenesis and protein translation via its two major
substrates S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E-BP1 [8, 9]. Activated
S6K causes feedback inhibition of insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1)/insulin signaling by phosphorylating
insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) resulting in its
degradation [10]. mTORC2 consists of mTOR, mLST8,
mSIN1, protor and rictor [11-15]. It has been shown
that mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Serine 473 (S473),
enhancing the catalytic activity of Akt, that has already
been phosphorylated at Threonine 308 (T308) [16, 17].
Thus, the mTOR complexes play an important role both
upstream and downstream of Akt [18].
Rapamycin and its analogs are allosteric
mTOR inhibitors that bind FKBP12 and mTOR, and
predominantly inhibit mTORC1. The rapamycin

The Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a
central role in cell metabolism, growth, proliferation and,
survival [1, 2]. Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
contributes to the pathogenesis of many tumor types, and
thus the pathway is being actively pursued as a promising
therapeutic target [3-5]. mTOR, an important component
of this pathway, exists in two multiprotein complexes:
mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC1
and mTORC2). mTORC1 includes the mTOR protein,
mammalian LST8, proline rich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40)
and raptor [1, 6, 7] and controls cell growth, survival,

analog temsirolimus is approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of advanced renal cell
carcinoma and the rapamycin analog everolimus is FDA
approved for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors, renal cell carcinoma, sub-ependymal giant
cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis, as
single agent therapy, and for the treatment of hormonereceptor positive breast cancer as combination therapy
with exemestane. Rapalogs have also shown promise in
clinical trials in other tumor types, such as mesothelioma
and endometrial cancer [1, 19]. However, rapalogs have
shown objective responses in only a subset of patients,
and unfortunately the responses are frequently shortlived. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to rapalogs are
unknown.
These therapeutic failures have been attributed, in
part, to rapamycin-induced Akt activation, as a result of
inhibition of the S6K/IRS-1 feedback loop. Rapamycin
not only inhibits S6K phosphorylation but also induces
Akt S473 phosphorylation, hence activating Akt [20,
21]. Although we have observed that rapamycin-induced
Akt phosphorylation is increased more in rapamycinsensitive cell lines compared to resistant cell lines [3],
rapamycin-mediated Akt activation may be responsible
for the attenuated antitumor efficacy of rapamycin and
its analogs observed in patients. Approaches to prevent
Akt activation, such as the use of inhibitors of upstream
signaling, are being pursued [22]. However, an alternate
approach is to target this pathway with mTOR kinase
inhibitors that potently inhibit mTORC1 as well as
mTORC2, thus inhibiting Akt S473 phosphorylation,
and thereby preventing or attenuating the feedback loop
activation of Akt and potentially treating PI3K/mTOR
dependent cancers more effectively [23].
MLN0128, also known as INK128, is a novel ATPcompetitive mTOR kinase inhibitor, currently in phase
I clinical trials for advanced solid malignancies. We
sought to determine the effect of MLN0128 on rapamycin
sensitive cell lines as well as in cell lines with intrinsic and
acquired rapamycin-resistance both in vitro and in vivo.
We demonstrate that MLN0128 caused greater inhibition
of mTORC1 signaling, mTORC2 signaling, cell cycle
progression and translation in most cell lines compared
to rapamycin. Likewise, MLN0128 sensitivity was
significantly greater in cell lines that have either intrinsic
resistance to rapamycin or have acquired rapamycin
resistance highlighting the efficacy of this compound in
resistant settings compared to rapamycin. Furthermore,
MLN0128 caused growth inhibitory effect in several in
vivo models, and had a greater growth-inhibitory effect in
in vivo models of acquired rapamycin resistance. Further,
we report that prolonged rapamycin treatment in vitro was
associated with acquisition of an mTOR kinase mutation,
with insensitivity to rapamycin-mediated inhibition of
mTOR signaling and cell growth, but with sensitivity to
MLN0128.

MLN0128 has Potent Antitumor Efficacy In Vitro
We tested the MLN0128 sensitivity of 16 cell lines;
the panel was enriched for breast cancer cell lines but
consisted of cell lines with varying genomic alterations
including mutations in PIK3CA and PTEN. These cell
lines were selected as they represented cell lines with a
range of sensitivities to rapamycin based on our previous
study of a larger 43 cell line screen for rapamycin
sensitivity (Supplementary Table S1) [3]. MLN0128 and
rapamycin sensitivity was assessed by sulforhodamine
B (SRB) assay (Fig. 1A). As expected the sensitivity of
cell lines to rapamycin varied [3]. Most cell lines were
sensitive to MLN0128 with IC50s in the low nano-molar
range. T47D and ZR75-1 cell lines were sensitive to both
MLN0128 and rapamycin. MDA-MB-231, ACHN, and
A498 cell lines were resistant to rapamycin but sensitive
to MLN0128. HT29 and HeLa cell lines were resistant to
rapamycin, and were less sensitive to MLN0128, but still
had significant growth inhibition with clinically achievable
MLN0128 concentrations (HT29 IC50=150 nM and HeLa
IC50=75 nM).
The effect of MLN0128 on cell cycle progression
was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). Cancer cell
lines were treated with vehicle, rapamycin 100 nM, or
MLN0128 100 nM for 3 days, and percentages of cells
in subG1, G1, S, and G2/M phases were measured. Both
MLN0128 (P<0.0001) and rapamycin (P<0.01) caused
significant inhibition of cell cycle progression from G1 to
S phase in T47D. In MDA-MB-231 and HT29, MLN0128,
but not rapamycin, significantly increased the percentage
of cells in G1 phase (P<0.001). In ZR75-1 cell lines
neither treatment increased cells in G1 phase; however,
MLN0128 caused a significant increase in the subG1
population of cells (P<0.001).
To determine whether MLN0128 induced apoptosis,
cancer cell lines representative of each group were
treated with vehicle or rapamycin 100 nM or MLN0128
100 nM for 3 days, and the percentages of annexin V
positive cells were determined (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
MLN0128 induced significant apoptosis (P<0.0001) in
ZR75-1 cells only, corresponding with an increase in the
subG1 population of cells observed in cell cycle analysis.
We did not see significant apoptosis in other cell lines.
Immunoblotting also showed no increase in expression
of cleaved caspase 3 or cleaved PARP with MLN0128
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
We also assessed the effect of MLN0128 and
rapamycin on anchorage-dependent growth of T47D,
MDA-MB-231, HeLa and HT29 cells using a colony
formation assay. Two weeks later, cell colonies were
stained with crystal violet, plates were scanned and the

Signaling

colonies quantitated. MLN0128 treatment resulted in a
dramatic decline in colony-forming ability compared with
rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1C and D).
Hence, MLN0128 was found to have growth
inhibitory in several cancer cell lines with differing
genomic backgrounds and with varying rapamycin
sensitivity. However, MLN0128 predominantly had
a cytostatic effect with little effect on apoptosis and or
autophagy in most cell lines tested.

mTOR kinase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit
mTORC1 and mTORC2 [24, 25]. The effects of MLN0128
and rapamycin on mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling
were compared in rapamycin sensitive and resistant cell
lines groups (Fig. 2A). Rapamycin potently inhibited the
phosphorylation of S6, downstream substrate of mTORC1,

MLN0128 Decreases Cap-dependent and Capindependent Translational Activity

but poorly inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation as has been
previously described [26, 27]. In contrast MLN0128
effectively inhibited S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation,
hence showing strong mTORC1 inhibition compared with
rapamycin.
As has been reported previously, rapamycin did
not inhibit mTORC2 and in certain contexts, induced
Akt S473 phosphorylation [20, 21]. On the contrary,
MLN0128 inhibits phosphorylation of Akt at S473, a
downstream substrate of mTORC2 (Fig. 2A). Hence
MLN0128 inhibited mTORC2, preventing mTORC2dependent feedback activation of Akt; however, MLN0128
did increase phosphorylation of Akt at T308 in T47D,
ZR75-1, and A498 cells (Fig. 2A).

To determine the effect of MLN0128 on protein
translation, a reporter plasmid construct pCDNA3-rLucpolIRES-fLUC was used that once transfected measures
cap-dependent translational activity through renilla
luciferase activity and internal ribosomal entry system
(IRES) dependent translation through firefly luciferase
activity. T47D (intrinsically sensitive to rapamycin) and
MDA-MB-231 cells (intrinsically resistant to rapamycin),
were transfected with reporter plasmid and a dual
luciferase assay kit was used to measure renilla and firefly
activity (Fig. 2B). In both cell lines, MLN0128 treatment
decreased cap-dependent translation.

performed to assess mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. (B) MLN0128 decreases translational activity. Cancer cell lines T47D and MDAMB-231 were trypsinized, counted, and plated on 60 mm plates. They were transfected with a bicistronic pcDNA3-rLuc-polIRES-fLUC

activity) and then treated with vehicle, rapamycin (100 nM), and MLN0128 (100 nM) for 24 hours. Dual luciferase assay kit was used
to measure luciferase activity. The data represent the mean ± SE of three independent experiments performed in triplicate and analyzed
(**P<0.01, ***P<0.001, vs. control).

MLN0128 Causes Growth Inhibition In Vivo

(P=0.1792, P=0.0591, and P=0.8541 respectively) (Fig.
3). In contrast, MLN0128 treatment, at doses of 1 mg/kg,
previously described as an in vivo effective dose [28-31],
led to significant tumor growth inhibition was observed
compared with vehicle in all three cell lines (ACHN
P=0.0093, ZR75-1 P=0.0012, MDA-MB-231 P=0.0263).
In MCF7 xenografts, both MLN0128 and everolimus
caused significant growth inhibition (P=0.0012 and
P=0.0022, respectively). In contrast, HT29 xenografts
responded to everolimus resulting in significantly lower
tumor volume (P=0.0072) but with MLN0128 treatment,
a decrease in tumor volume was observed but was not
statistically significant (P=0.0827).

To expand our findings in vivo, we determined the
activity of MLN0128 in five different xenograft models.
We analyzed xenografts from ZR75-1, MCF7 cell lines
that are rapamycin-sensitive in vitro and xenografts
from ACHN, MDA-MB-231 and HT29 cell lines that
are rapamycin-resistant in vitro. The statistical analyses
were done by comparing tumor volumes in treatment
arms with tumor volumes in the vehicle arm at the
termination of experiment. Mice bearing ACHN, ZR751 or MDA-MB-231 xenografts did not show statistically
significant growth inhibition with everolimus treatment

compared to vehicle and data was analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. Data are presented as mean ± SE (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, vs. control).

Resistance to Rapamycin

and cap-independent (BT474 Par, P<0.01; BT474 RR,
P<0.001) translational activity while rapamycin decreased
cap-dependent (P<0.001) translational activity in BT474
Par cell lines only (Fig. 4C).
Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTORC1 leads to its
dissociation from eIF4E, allowing binding of eIF4G at the
same site, hence allowing translation initiation complex
formation at the 5` end of mRNAs [27]. Thus, we expected
that MLN0128 by de-phosphorylating 4E-BP1 leads to a
decrease in translational activity, decreasing eIF4G-eIF4E
binding. BT474 Par and BT474 RR cell lines were treated
with control, rapamycin and MLN0128. The fraction of
eIF4E associated with 4E-BP1 and eIF4G was examined
by purification of lysates using 7-methyl GTP-sepharose
beads; eIF4E and eIF4E-bound proteins were detected by
immunoblotting analysis. Rapamycin led to a decrease in
eIF4E-associated eIF4G in BT474 Par cells but not BT474
RR cells (Fig. 4D). In contrast, MLN0128 resulted in a

Although rapalogs often have antitumor efficacy
of limited duration in the clinic, currently little is known
about mechanisms of acquired resistance to rapalogs.
To get insight into mechanisms of acquired rapamycin
resistance and approaches to overcome them, we created
BT474 rapamycin resistant (BT474 RR) cell lines through
culturing rapamycin-sensitive BT474 parental cells
(BT474 Par) in progressively higher concentrations of
rapamycin. We then tested the activity of MLN0128 in
BT474 Par and RR cell lines in vitro.
BT474 Par cell lines were sensitive to the growthinhibitory effect of rapamycin and everolimus, and at
clinically relevant levels, MLN0128 as well as, rapalogs,
inhibited BT474 Par. In contrast neither rapamycin nor
everolimus significantly inhibited BT474 RR cell line
growth while MLN0128 demonstrated significant growth
inhibitory effect on BT474 RR cells in vitro (Fig. 4A).
As expected in BT474 Par cells, immunoblotting
showed that rapamycin inhibited mTORC1 substrates
(p4E-BP1, pS6K) and downstream pS6, with activation
of pAkt S473, while MLN0128 treatment inhibited pAkt
S473 and inhibited p4E-BP1 more robustly (Fig. 4B).
Strikingly in BT474 RR cell lines neither rapamycin
nor everolimus inhibited the mTORC1 axis i.e. pS6,
pS6K T389, or p4E-BP1. In contrast MLN0128 robustly
inhibited mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 4A).
The effect of rapamycin and MLN0128 was then
assessed on cap-dependent and independent translation.
BT474 Par and BT474 RR cells were transfected with the
bicistronic luciferase vector (as in Fig. 2B) and treated with
rapamycin or MLN0128. In BT474 Par and BT474 RR
cell lines, only MLN0128 caused statistically significant
decline in both cap-dependent (both cell lines, P<0.001)
Figure 4: MLN0128 is effective in cell lines with
acquired rapamycin resistance. (A) BT474 Par and RR

cell lines were treated with increasing doses of MLN0128,
everolimus and rapamycin, using SRB assay to determine IC50.
These experiments were repeated at least three times and data
are presented as mean ± SE. (B) These cell lines were treated
daily with vehicle, rapamycin (100 nM), and MLN0128 (100
nM) for 72 hours. Western blotting was performed to assess
mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. (C) Cancer cell lines BT474

was used to measure luciferase activity. The data represent mean

and analyzed (**P<0.01, ***P<0.001, vs. control). (D) BT474

blotting.

decrease in eIF4G associated with eIF4E in both BT474
Par cells and BT474 RR cells.

Rapamycin Resistant BT474 RR cells Harbor an
mTOR Mutation

Next, we determined the in vivo effect of rapamycin
and MLN0128 in BT474 PAR and RR xenograft models.
In the BT474 Par xenografts, both rapamycin and
MLN0128 treatment showed significant tumor growth
inhibition (for all treatment groups, P<0.05) compared
to vehicle (Fig. 6A and 6B). In the BT474 RR xenograft
model, rapamycin treatment did not lead to significant
tumor growth inhibition; however, MLN0128 treatment
resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition (P=0.0152)
in comparison with vehicle.

As rapamycin did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling
in BT474 RR cells, we hypothesized that prolonged
rapamycin treatment may have caused an acquired
mutation in mTOR or other upstream kinases with
constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling. To test this
hypothesis, we performed targeted exome sequencing
cells using a 202 gene panel that includes mTOR as well
as multiple other cancer-related genes (Supplementary
Table S2). Comparing BT474 Par and BT474 RR cells,
we identified an mTOR S2035F mutation in the BT474
RR cells (Fig. 5A). This mutation corresponds to the
FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain of mTOR and has
been previously described in vitro transcription and
translation assays, and in yeast models as a mutation
known to interfere with mTOR-FKBP12 interaction and
to confer rapamycin-resistance [32-34]. The existence of
this point mutation was confirmed with digital polymerase
chain reaction (Fig. 5B and 5C).

DISCUSSION
Akt/mTOR signaling plays key roles in controlling
major cellular processes, including cell growth, protein
translation, autophagy, metabolism, and cell survival
[1, 2]. Activated Akt/mTOR signaling is a significant
contributor to pathogenesis of cancer. Akt and mTOR
have been shown to reciprocally regulate activity
[25]. MLN0128 is an ATP-competitive mTOR kinase
inhibitor; we sought to determine the antitumor efficacy
of MLN0128 in cell lines of varying genetic backgrounds

and varying sensitivity to rapamycin. We demonstrated
that MLN0128 potently inhibits both S6 and 4E-BP1
phosphorylation in cells, with more robust inhibition of
mTORC1 signaling than rapamycin; also in addition,
MLN0128 completely inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt
S473, consistent with its efficient inhibition of mTORC2
as well.
Rapamycin analogs have been FDA-approved
for treatment of several tumor types, but single agent
treatment has resulted in modest objective response
rates. Where there is activity observed with allosteric
mTOR inhibitors, they appear to be cytostatic, primarily
stabilizing clinical disease, rather than resulting in tumor
regression [1]. mTORC1 is implicated in several human
diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and
cancer. These diseases reveal aberrant cell growth and
proliferation. Unlike S6Ks, 4E-BPs do not have an effect
on cell size, but they regulate proteins involved in cell
proliferation and cell cycle progression [35]. By evolving
resistance to mTOR inhibitors, several studies identified
a decrease in 4E-BP expression and an increase in
expression of eIF4E and c-Myc [36-38]. Further, the 4EBP/eIF4E ratio was suggested as an indicator of acquired
and intrinsic resistance [36]. In BT474 Par cells, we
observed a partial inhibition of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1
by rapamycin and everolimus, whereas in BT474 RR cells

there was no inhibition. In contrast, MLN0128 inhibited
4E-BP1 phosphorylation in both cell lines completely.
Considering the recently acknowledged importance of
mTOR/4E-BP axis in rapamycin resistance, MLN0128 is
likely to overcome this problem.
It has been proposed that this may be due
to upregulation of feedback loops in which Akt
phosphorylation and activity are increased by relieving
S6K–driven suppression of IGF-1R signaling [21]. Some
studies suggest that inhibition of mTORC2 will lead
to the dephosphorylation of Akt at the S473 site and a
more profound inhibition of Akt function than would be
expected from dephosphorylation of Akt T308 alone [24,
39]. Thus, mTOR kinase inhibition has been proposed
to prevent the feedback loop activation of Akt that may
attenuate the response of patients with rapamycin therapy.
In our data, MLN0128 showed potent and persistent
mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition; however the inhibition
of phosphorylation of Akt T308 is only temporary. These
results are consistent with other work that demonstrated
a biphasic Akt inhibition with mTOR kinase inhibitor
AZD8055 [40]. This induction of PI3K activation may
be due to relief of feedback activation of RTK signaling.
Despite reactivation of Akt T308, MLN0128 was
effective in inhibiting cell growth, and protein translation
in cell lines that are not only sensitive to rapamycin but

also in cell lines that are resistant to rapamycin. Most
cell lines were sensitive to MLN0128 with an IC50 in
nanomolar range in vitro. In vivo, MLN0128 resulted
in significant growth inhibition in five of the xenograft
models tested representing cell lines with a variety of
genomic backgrounds (ZR75-1, MCF7, MDA-MB-231,
BT474, ACHN, Supplementary Table S1). However,
tumor regression was observed only in MCF7 xenografts
emphasizing the need to pursue novel combinations, and
raising the possibility that combinatorial therapies that
also abrogate Akt T308 phosphorylation may have even
greater in vivo tumor efficacy. We observed that some of
our in vitro and in vivo results did not correlate completely.
The growth of rapamycin-sensitive ZR75-1 xenografts
was not significantly inhibited by everolimus. Similar
discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo models are
well-known. An in depth analysis of effect of everolimus
on mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities may explain
the mechanistic background of this discrepancy. Also,
although HT29 cells were relatively resistant to rapamycin
in vitro, the in vivo growth of HT29 xenografts was
inhibited by everolimus (P=0.0072) but not by MLN0128
(P=0.0827). It is feasible that a larger study may have
indeed demonstrated a statistically significant difference
with MLN0128 as well. The greater antitumor efficacy in
vivo than in vitro suggests that xenograft models capture
additional antitumor mechanisms of action. Indeed a
recently study but Mercier et al. demonstrated mTOR
inhibition with rapamycin can have multiple effects on
the microenvironment including decreases in the levels of
angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and the total number of
fibroblasts in the tumor stroma [41].
Most patients who derive clinical benefit from
rapalogs may have disease stabilization for several
months but ultimately progress. [41-43]The mechanism
of acquired resistance to rapamycin analogs remains
unknown at this time. There is increasing recognition
that tumors evolve with progression and with treatment
pressure. A variety of acquired genomic alterations that
confer resistance to targeted therapies have been described
including acquired Bcr-Abl mutations in response to
imatinib treatment [44], ras mutations with cetuximab
[45], EGFR mutations [46, 47] MET amplification with
EGFR inhibitors[48], and loss of HER2 with trastuzumabbased therapy [49]. Thus, an acquired mutation in mTOR
is a logical mechanism for acquired rapamycin resistance.
This precise mutation has not been reported in TCGA or
COSMIC [50]. However, an extensive study of serine at
2035 showed that substituting with aspartate, threonine,
glutamine, and isoleucine abolished FKBP12-rapamycin
binding, whereas conversion to alanine had a similar
binding affinity compared to wild-type [33]. Also, these
mTOR S2035 mutants can phosphorylate S6K and 4EBP1 normally [34, 51, 52]. As there are no supporting
experiments yet, it is not defined if the larger side chain of
phenylalanine may abolish formation of complex or not.

Further studies are needed to determine if this alteration
is acquired in patients treated with rapalogs. If so, for
patients who initially had benefited from rapalogs may
achieve additional benefit from transitioning to an mTOR
kinase inhibitor or another PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor.
In summary, MLN0128 is an effective inhibitor of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Cancer cell lines with
intrinsic as well as acquired resistance to rapamycin are
responsive to mTOR kinase inhibitor MLN0128. Ongoing
clinical trials will test the efficacy of MLN0128 in patients
with intrinsic as well as acquired resistance. We also
report the novel finding of an acquired mTOR mutation
associated with acquired rapamycin resistance. Further
studies are needed to clinically validate this finding.

METHODS
Cell Lines and Cultures
Cancer cell lines obtained from American Tissue
Culture Collection were: A498, ACHN (kidney), BT474,
HCC70, HCC1428, HCC1806, MCF7, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-453, MDAMB-468, T47D, ZR75-1 (breast), HeLa (cervix), HT29
(colon), and M14 (melanoma). NCI/ADR-RES ovarian
cancer cells were obtained from the National Cancer
Institute. All cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F12
media supplemented with 10% FBS and were passaged
for less than 6 months after resuscitation and were
authenticated by vendors.

Acquired Resistance Cell Lines
The breast cancer cell line BT474 was cultured
in progressively increasing doses of rapamycin until
sustained growth at supra-therapeutic (10 μM) doses was
achieved (approximately 18 months). Pool populations
(non-clonal) of the parental cell lines (BT474 Par) and
the cell lines with acquired rapamycin resistance (BT474
rapamycin resistant (RR)) were generated. Their identities
were confirmed by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling.

Reagents
Rapamycin was purchased from LC Laboratories.,
Inc. DMSO was bought from Sigma-Aldrich. MLN0128
for in vitro studies was kindly provided by Intellikine Inc.
(La Jolla, CA). Additional MLN0128 was purchased from
ChemieTek (Indianapolis, IN). For in vivo experiments
methyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and N-methyl-2pyrrolidone (Sigma) were used as vehicles.

Cell Growth Assay

eIF4E-containing 5’ mRNA Cap Complex
Analysis

Antiproliferative activity was tested by SRB assay
[53]. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
was determined from dose-response curves after 4 days
of treatment [54].

BT474 Par and RR cells were treated with DMSO,
rapamycin (100 nM) and MLN1028 (100 nM) for 72
hours. Approximately 500 μg of total protein for each
condition was incubated with 7-methyl GTP Sepharose
4B beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for two hours
at 4°C. Pelleted beads were washed twice with lysis
buffer and suspended in 1X SDS-PAGE sample buffer
(containing 12.5% v/v β-mercaptoethanol) and eIF4E,
eIF4G and 4E-BP1 levels contained in the elutes were
analyzed by western blotting [58].

Colony Formation Assay
Colony formation assay was performed as
previously described [55]. Briefly, cells were trypsinized,
counted and plated at a density of 1-5 × 103 cells
depending on the cell lines/60 mm plates in triplicate for
each treatment group. Approximately 2-3 weeks later
when the controls had colonies approaching confluency,
plates were fixed, stained with crystal violet and scanned.
The colonies were counted using NIH ImageJ v.1.46
software.

Targeted Exome Sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from BT474 Par and
BT474 RR cell lines using Qiagen’s Qiaprep Kit according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was quantified
by Qubit (Invitrogen) and quality was assessed using
Genomic DNA Tape for the 2200 TapeStation (Agilent).
DNA was sheared by sonication and to ensure the proper
fragment size, samples were checked on TapeStation
using the DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent). The sheared
DNA proceeded to library prep using KAPA library prep
kit (KAPA) following the “with beads” manufacturer
protocol. Samples were quantified using KAPA qPCR
quantification kit. Equimolar amounts of DNA were
pooled (8-12 samples per pool) for capture of 202 genes
that are clinically relevant in cancer (Supplementary
Table S2). We designed biotin labeled probes with Roche
Nimblegen for capturing target regions (all exons in those
202 genes) and followed manufacture’s protocol for
the capture step. The captured libraries were sequenced
on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA)
on a version 3 TruSeq paired end flowcell according to
manufacturer’s instructions at a cluster density between
700 – 1000 K clusters/mm2. Sequencing was performed
on a HiSeq 2000 for 2 × 100 paired end reads with a 7
nt read for indexes using Cycle Sequencing v3 reagents
(Illumina). The resulting BCL files containing the
sequence data were converted into “.fastq.gz” files and
individual libraries within the samples were demultiplexed
using CASAVA 1.8.2 with no mismatches. All regions
were covered by >20 reads. For data analysis, the targetcaptured deep-sequencing data was aligned to human
reference assembly hg19 using BWA and duplicated reads
were removed using samtools. Single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) and small indels were called using VarScan2 [59],
which classified variants. To understand the potential
functional consequence of detected variants, they were
compared with dbSNP, COSMIC [50], and TCGA
databases, and were annotated them using VEP [60],
Annovar [61], SIFT [62], Polyphen [63], and Condel [64].

Cell Cycle Analysis and Annexin V Binding Assay
For cell cycle assay, floating cells, as well those that
were attached to the culture dish, were collected. Samples
were analyzed by flow cytometry and ModFit LT software
(Verity Software House). Apoptosis was identified by
using the Annexin V apoptosis kit (Roche) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol, and cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry and FlowJo v.10 (Tree Star) [54].

Western Blotting
Immunoblotting was performed as described
previously [56] with the following antibodies: Akt, pAkt
T308, pAkt S473, caspase 3, eIF4E, eIF4G, LC3B, PARP,
S6K, pS6K T389, pS6 S235/236, pS6 S240/244, 4E-BP1,
p4E-BP1 T37/46, p4E-BP1 S65, p4E-BP1 T70 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc.) and actin (Sigma).

Dual Luciferase Assay
The reporter plasmid pCDNA3-rLuc-polIRES-fLUC
was a gift from Nahum Sonenberg. T47D, MDA-MB-231,
BT474 Par and BT474 RR cell lines were transfected with
reporter plasmid using DharmaFECT transfection reagent
by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, MA). Dual
luciferase assays were performed with the dual luciferase
reporter assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol [57].
