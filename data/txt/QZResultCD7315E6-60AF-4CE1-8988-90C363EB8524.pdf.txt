ABSTRACT
Abnormal proliferation and drug resistance are the hallmarks of lung
adenocarcinoma (LAD). Dispite the advances in diagnosis and therapy, the 5-year
survival remains low. Increasing studies regarding its pathological mechanism have
been focused on microRNA (miRNA) due to its nodal regulatory properties. This study
aims to characterize the expression of miR-432 in LAD and investigate its effects
on the proliferation and sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin. Here, we report
that downregulation of miR-432 in LAD tissues was correlated with a higher clinical
stage (p = 0.03) and poor prognosis (p = 0.036). Additionally, miR-432 expression
was negative correlated with high Ki67 labeling index (p = 0.016) in our cohorts.
Functionally, over-expression of miR-432 inhibits cell proliferation through arresting
cell cycle and sensitizes tumor cells to cisplatin. Mechanistically, miR-432 functions
by directly targeting E2F3 and AXL, and they, in turn, mediate the regulation of miR432 towards cell proliferation and cisplatin sensitivity. Importantly, miR-432 levels
are negatively correlated with the levels of E2F3 and AXL in human LAD tissues. These
results demonstrated that miR-432 functions as a tumor-suppressive miRNA and may
represent a prognostic parameter and therapeutic target for LAD.

INTRODUCTION

also be applied for diagnosing or predicting the prognosis
of LAD patients [4, 5]. Given that many miRNAs are
deregulated in LAD but have not yet been further studied,
it is expected that more miRNAs will emerge as critical
players in the etiology and progression of LAD.
Previous studies have reported that miR-432 was
depressed in various tumors, such as hepatocellular
carcinoma, cervical  and ovarian  cancer [6–8]. Functional
studies demonstrated that it could act as oncogene or
tumor suppressor depending on cell types. For example,
miR-432 suppresses ADAR1 expression and promotes cell
proliferation in metastatic melanoma. Alternatively, miR432 induces tumor suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells by targeting LRP6, TRIM29 and Pygo2, which

Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD), is the most common
histological subtype of non-small cell lung cancer and
its incidence has increased markedly over the past few
decades in many countries, including China [1]. Lung
carcinogenesis is a complex, stepwise process that
involves an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic
changes, much research has been conducted to elucidate its
mechanisms [2]. In recent years, miRNAs have received
great attention in LAD research and dysregulation of
miRNAs plays critical roles in the prolifersion, metasitasis
and chemoresistance of LAD [3] Furthermore, its
abnormal expression in tissues, serums and sputums could

Similarly, it could target the oncogene NESTIN/NES,
RCOR1/COREST and MECP2 in neuroblastoma cells to
induce neurite projections, arrest cells in G0-G1and reduce
cell proliferation. When clinic-pathological predictors
were included, multivariate analysis reveals that miR-432
expression levels remains significant as independent
predictors for recurrence-free survivals. However,
the
expression
and
function
of
miR-432
in LAD, as well as and its putative target genes, was
unclear to date. In this study, we show that the expression
of miR-432 was markedly reduced in LAD tissues and its
expression was associated with clinical tumor stage. Also,
Kaplan–Meier survival analyses showed that depressed
miR-432 expression was correlated with cancer-specific
death of LAD patients. Functionally and mechanistically,
our in vitro and in vivo assays indicate that miR-432
overexpression could inhibite the cell proliferation
and tumor formation of LAD. Furtherrmore, miR-432
overexpression could sensitize LAD cells to cisplatin
treatment, Of note, E2F3 and AXL were identified as
the direct targets of miR-432 to fully fucntions in LAD.
Totally, our findings highlight the importance of miR-432
dysfunction in promoting tumor progression and
chemoresistance and implicate miR-432 as a potential
therapeutic target in lung cancer.

clinic-pathological variables are summarized in Table 1.
Of note, reduced miR-432 expression was observed to be
significantly associated with advanced clinical tumor stage
(p = 0.030, Table 1), but not with patients’ age, gender and
lymphatic metastasis. We also compared cancer-specific
survival rates between patients with high or low miR-432
levels in univariate models. The median value of all cases
was chosen as the cutoff point for separating miR-432
high-expression cases from miR-432 low-expression
cases [12]. The group of patients who had higher miR-432
levels had a less rate of mortality than patients who had
not (p = 0.036, Figure 1D).
Ki-67 was a classic proliferation biomarker, and
previous studies have shown Ki67 to be an independent
predictor of outcome in LAD patients [13]. In this study,
immunohistochemical analysis was performed to measure
the protein levels of Ki-67 in the tumor tissues (Figure 1E)
and a significant negative association was identified
between Ki67 labeling index with miR-432 expression in
LAD tissues (p = 0.016, Table 1).

MiR-432 regulates cell proliferation of LAD
in vitro and in vivo
To determine the biological activity of miR-432 in
LAD, A549 and H1299 were selected for further study.
Transfection of miR-432  mimics resulted in significant
overexpression of miR-432 (Figure 2A). As expected,
ectopic expression of miR-432 significantly decreased
the growth rates of A549 and H1299 cells, analyzed by
MTS assays (Figure 2B), and whereas overexpression of
the miR-mimics control failed to influence cell vitality
compared with non-transfected cells. We then performed
in vitro loss-of-function analyses by antagonizing miR-432
with miR-432 inhibitor (Figure 2C). The results showed
that miR-432 inhibitor rather than the inhibitor control
enhanced cell vitality in both A549 and H1299 cells
(Figure 2D). Furthermore, DNA synthesis levels, as
examined with the BrdU incorporation assay, were
significantly decreased in miR-432-overexpressing
cells, whereas control cells had relatively higher BrdU
incorporation rates (Figure 2E). In contrast, suppression
of miR-432 by transfection with its inhibitor showed the
opposite tendency (Figure 2F).
To assess whether this effect is mediated through
perturbation of the cell cycle, cell cycle distribution analysis
was performed. We found that more than 60% of cells were
in the G1 phase after aphidicolin treatment, and there was
no difference between groups in cell cycle distribution.
However, after withdrawal of aphidicolin, overexpression
of miR-432 led to a significant accumulation in the S phase
of A549 and H1299 cells (Figure 2G), indicating the antiproliferation effect of miR-432 was achieved partly by
regulating the cell cycles in LAD.
To investigate whether miR-432 inhibits the
proliferation of tumor cells in vivo, we applied a

RESULTS
MiR-432 is downregulated in LAD
To identify novel miRNA acting as tumor suppressor
in LAD, we comparatively analyzed the expression of
25 miRNAs in three matched-pairs of primary tumor
and its surrounding normal tissues. Of note, all of
these miRNAs were previously reported to be highly
dysregulated in LAD but their exact roles remained unclear
[9–11]. Eleven of the miRNAs, including miR-329,
miR-202, miR-432, miR-302, miR-1470, miR-290, miR514, miR-184, miR-625, miR-382 and miR-689, were
significantly repressed in LAD when compared with
the normal tissues ( > 3 fold change, Figure 1A). We
selected miR-432 for further investigation based on the
following results. Firstly, a total of 278 formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded LAD and 30 normal lung tissues were
collected in this study and miR-432 was confirmed to be
markedly decreased as compared with those of normal
ones (Figure 1B). Secondlly, it was progressively lost as
the tumor grade increases (Figure 1C). The above data
indicates the potential involvement of miR-432 in the
pathological progression of LAD.
miR-432 has been recently shown to be dysregulated
in various tumors [6–8]. To elucidate the role of miR432 in lung cancer, we first analyzed its correlation with
clinicopathologic parameters in patients with LAD. The
relationship between the miR-432 expression levels and

miR-432 could inhibit tumorigenesis in xenografted tumor
model. As shown in Figure 2H and 2I, the tumors formed
by miR-432-mimics-transduced cells were smaller and
lighter than the groups of mimics or untreated controls.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that miR-432

cells were dramatically downregulated in response to
miR-432 mimics transfection, but upregulated by the
transfection of miR-432 inhibitor (Figure 3C and 3D).
To verify the regulation miR-432 towards AXL and
E2F3 in LAD, the basal levels of these parameters were
firstly detected by RT-qPCR. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S1A, the expression of miR-432 is relatively lower
in A549 than in H1299. In addition, E2F3 is relatively
lower in A549 than in H1299, but AXL in more-expressed
in H1299 than in A549 (Supplementary Figure S1B ).
We further performed luciferase reporter assay
to confirm whether E2F3 and AXL are direct targets of
miR-432. As shown in Figure 3E and 3F, ectopic expression
of miR-432 decreased the luciferase activities of the
3’UTRs of E2F3 and AXL in HEK193T cells. However,
a miR-432 mutant containing four altered nucleotides
in the seed sequence showed no inhibitory effects on
luciferase activity. Based on the basal level of miR-432 is
relatively lower in A549 than in H1299 (Supplementary
Figure S1A), we over-expressed miR-432 in A549. We
found that its overexpression suppressed the luciferase
activities of the 3’UTRs of E2F3 and AXL (Figure 3G
and 3H). However, transfection of miR-432 inhibitor in
H1299 led to the increased activities of the 3’UTRs of
E2F3 and AXL (Figure 3I and 3J). Of note, the above

MiR-432 suppresses E2F3 and AXL directly
To explore the mechanism underlying the tumor
suppressive role of miR-432 on LAD, we used publicly
available algorithms (TargetScan and miRanda) to predict
the potential targets of miR-432 in humans. From this
set, we further selected the ones with relevance to LAD
based on their associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms
[14]. Then, as E2F3 and AXL have been reported to
function as oncogene to promote cell proliferation and
drug resistance in various tumors [15, 16], and taken
the potential tumor suppressor role of miR-432 in LAD
based on the above results together, E2F3 and AXL were
selected for the detailed study. Figure 3A and 3B shows
the two potential targets of miR-432, including E2F3
and AXL. As expected, Western blotting demonstrated
that E2F3 and AXL expression in both A549 and H1299

seed sequence. All of these results support that miR-432
suppresses E2F3 and AXL expression by directly targeting
their 3’UTR in LAD cells.

with the same function in LAD. Therefore, to validate
it, we treated inhibitor control- or miR-432 inhibitortransfected A549 and H1299 cells with cisplatin (5 µg/ml)
for different timepoints. As expected, cisplatin treatment
suppressed the growth rates at different timepoints in the
presence or absence of inhibitor control (Figure 4A and 4B).
However, miR-432 inhibition significantly attenuated the
decrease of cell vitality in A549 and H1299 cells in response
to cisplatin treatment (Figure 4A and 4B), which suggests
that miR-432 may affect the sensitivity of cisplatin in LAD.
Then, we overexpressed miR-432 using its mimics
to investigate its effect on the sensitivity of lung cancer cell
lines A549 and H1299 to cisplastin. As expected, miR-423

mimics transfection suppressed that the cell vitality of
A549 and H1299 cells in contrast to the mimics control.
Then, compared with mimics control, miR-432 mimics
transfection caused cisplatin sensitivity at different
concentrations in both H1299 and A549 cells (Figure 4C).
Also, miR-432 overexpression could significantly increase
the Cisplatin-induced apoptosis of A549 or H1299 cells
when compared the mimics control treated with cisplatin,
as detected by FCM (Figure 4D). These results further
demonstrate that miR-432 could regulate the sensitivity of
H1299 and A549 cells to cisplatin.
To confirm the relation between miR-432 and E2F3/
AXL, we evaluated the expression levels of these parameters
in A549 and H1299 cells. As expected, in contrast to the
vehicle at 0 h timepoint, the data showed that cisplatin could
up-regulate the expression of miR-432 (Figure 4E and 4F).

Of interest, the expression level of miR-432 increased
with cisplatin exposure in a dose-and time-dependent
manner (Figure 4E and 4F). Moreover, the mRNA levels of
E2F3 and AXL reduced significantly (Figure 4G and 4H).
Furthermore, a dose-dependent analysis demonstrated that
the expression levels of AXL and E2F3 were progressviely
depressed in A549 (Figure 4I) and H1299 (Figure 4J) in
respopnse to the transfection of miR-423 mimics.

Suppression of E2F3 and AXL is functionally
important for the biological effects of miR-432 in
LAD
Importantly, when E2F3 and AXL was ectopically
overexpressed in miR-432 mimics–transduced A549 and

vitality induced by miR-432 mimics were, at least partly,
antagonized. In addition, depletion of E2F3 and AXL
dramatically suppressed the increased proliferaion of miR432–inhibited E2F3 and AXL cells (Figure 5C and 5D).
Likewise, in the presence of Cisplatin, overexpressing
AXL (Figure 5E) or E2F3 (Figure 5F) could also block

the supression of cell vitality induced by miR-423 mimics
transfection. On the contrary, the increase of cell vitality
caused by miR-432 inhibitor was attenunated by silencing
AXL (Figure 5G) and E2F3 (Figure 5H). All these results
confirm the important involvement of E2F3 and AXL
during miR-432 functions in LAD.

Clinical relevance of miR-432 and its targets in
LAD

suppressor gene in LAD. However, miR-423 also function
as an oncogene in melanoma to promote metastasis
through its targeted gene, ADAR1, further surporting
the existence of a tumor type-specific manner of miR432 during functions. Furthermore, it is noted that cell
cycle dysregulation is an underlying mechanism for the
tumorigenesis and progression of lung cancer [1]. Recent
study revealed that miR-432 reduced cell proliferation
through arresting cells in G0-G1 in human neuroblastoma
cells [21]. Our results confirmed that miR-432 could also
inhibit the cell vitality through arresting the cell cycle into
S phase, although the mechanism needs to be validated.
E2F3 was generally considered to increase cellular
proliferation as a transcriptional activator through
promoting the G1/S transition and its amplification
was strongly associated with invasive tumor phenotype
and high tumor grade in a subset of bladder tumors and
prostate cancer [15, 22]. Recent studies validated E2F3 as
the direct target of various miRNAs, such miR-449a and
miR-200b, to be involved in the abnormal proliferation
and chemoresistance lung cancer [17, 23], supporting its
multifacet roles in the pathological onset or progression in
lung cancer. Herein, our data showed that E2F3 was also a
direct target of miR-432 in LAD. Thus, it was concluded
that down-regulation of E2F3 may be a molecular
mechanism by which miR-432 exerted its functions as a
tumor suppressor in human LAD cells.
Also, abnormal cell cycle contributes to the
acquirement of cisplatin resistant phenotype in lung
cancer, which is a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug
[24]. Previous study showed that miRNA dysregulation
can alter cisplatin chemoresistance in cancer cells [25] and,
of note, suppression of E2F3 is a potential mechanism by
which miR-200b reverses chemoresistance of docetaxelresistant LAD cells [26], suggesting that miR-432

We next determined whether there was any
association between the expression levels of miR-432 and
its targets in human LAD tissues. It was found that miR-432
levels were negatively correlated with the levels of E2F3
and AXL (Figure 6A and 6B), which confirms the interconnection between miR432 and E2F3 or AXL in the
pathological progression in LAD.

DISCUSSION
MiRNAs act as oncogene or tumor suppressor in
various tumor and accumulating evidence suggests that
miRNAs contribute greatly to the pathogenesis of LAD
[19]. In previous study, miR-432 was reported to act as
a tumor suppressor and its downregulation in multiple
tumors, for instance, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer,
Hepatocellular carcinoma and pituitary GH adenomas,
promotes tumorigenesis and progression through
modulating different targeted genes [6–8, 20]. In this
study, we found that miR-432 is significantly suppressed
in LAD tissues and its expression levels are inversely
correlated with clinical tumor stage and predict poor
prognosis in LAD patients. All these findings support
its potential involvement of miR-432 in the pathological
progression of LAD and promptes us to investigate its
exact functions.
As introduced above, miRNAs could promote
or inhibite the tumor progression depending on the
tissue type. Similarly, our in vitro and in vivo studies
demonstrated that after overexpression of miR-432, the
lung cancer cells displayed decrease of cell growth and
tumor formation, further validating miR-432 as a tumor

may have a similar function about drug resistance in lung
cancer. As expected, our results showed that miR-432
could regulate the sentivity of cancer cells to cisplatin
treatment. Therefore, combining cisplatin with miR-432
regulation may serve as a potential approach for lung
cancer therapy.
Overexpression of AXL has been identified in
various tumors and its expression levels were correlated
with abnormal proliferation, metastasis, drug resistance
and predicted poor prognosis [27]. Recently, inhibitor
targeting AXL was validated as a novel treatment
candidate in cancer therapy. In lung cancer, upregulation
of AXL could promote cell growth and motility and
may result in resistance to both targeted therapies
and conventional chemotherapy in lung cancer [28].
Interestingly, we also found that AXL is an additional
target of miR-432, which may be the other possibility that
decreased miR-432 causes abnormal proliferation and
chemoresistance in LAD.
Importantly, our results demonstrated that, in
the absence or presence of cisplatin, when miR-432expressing cells re-expressed E2F3 or AXL, their reduction
of cell vitality were reversed, whereas silencing E2F3 or
AXL could attenuate the effects of miR-432 inhibition on
cell vitality. Therefore, we believe that deppressed miR432 could promote the disease progression, expecially
the drug resistence, though E2F3 and AXL. To further
illustrate the co-participation of miR-432, AXL and
E2F3 during LAD progression, we evaluated their
expression in LAD tissues and showed that miR-432 was
inversely correlated with the expression levels of E2F3
and AXL. Furthermore, the miR-432 expression decreased
upon cisplatin treatment, but E2F3 and AXL showed the
opposite tendency. Although the basal levels of AXL and
E2F3 are different in A549 and H1299, the regulation
of miR-432 mimics/inhibitor towards drug resistance in
these two cell lines looks the same (Figure 4A, 4B and 4I).
These results suggest that the mechanism miR-432
functions in LAD is very comlex owing to its multiple
targets, which needs to be validated in the long run.
In conclusion, our work demonstrated miR-432
plays a tumor-suppressive role in LAD and its function
is mainly mediated by its targets, E2F3 and AXL.
These findings provide newinsight into the molecular
pathogenesis of LAD and implicate miR-432 as apotential
prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of LAD.

diagnostics for patients with LAD were determined
according to the Revised International System for Staging
Lung Cancer. The patients with LAD had received
neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy prior to tissue
sampling. Follow-up data were available for 278 patients,
ranging from 1 to 78 months (mean 48 months). A total
of three tissue microarrays were constructed. Two cores
(1.0 mm in diameter) were taken from each representative
tumor focus, and the morphology was confirmed by
three pathologists (DH and XY). Detailed clinical and
pathological profile were obtained from medical records
and maintained in a secure relational database with tissue
microarray data. The study protocol was approved by
the Ethics Committee of Shandong Academy of Medical
Sciences.

Cell lines and culture
Human lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H1299)
were obtained from and maintained as recommended
by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA). The A549 and H1299 cells
were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Hyclone,
USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Hyclone, USA). The cells were incubated in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

MTS assay
The in vitro growth of LAD cells was measured
using the MTS assay as described before [29]. 5000
cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates and
transfected with miRNA, siRNA or their controls at a
final concentration of 50  nM respectively. On the day
of detection, 20  μL MTS (Promega) was added into
each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hrs and
then plates shaken at room temperature for 10 min. The
absorbance was measured at 495 nm and three independent
experiments were analyzed.

BrdU cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in five replicates in 96-well plates
at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. After adhesion,
cells were transfected with miR-432 mimics or mimics
control. Cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring
BrdU incorporation during DNA synthesis according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Merck Millipore). BrdU
incorporation was measured using chemiluminescence
(absorbance: 450 nm).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient samples

RNA extraction and real time RT-PCR
(RT-qPCR)

All tissue specimens were collected via surgical
resection from patients diagnosed between October 2009
and May 2015 at the People’s hospital of Linyi (Linyi,
China). Written informed consent was obtained from
all study participants. Histological and pathological

tissues were examined and microdissected under a
dissecting microscope (Leica ASLMD, Witts Baden,
Germany). miRNA extraction was performed with a
miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), which
enabled copuriﬁcation of total RNA, including miRNA,
from formalin-fixed and parafﬁn-embedded tissue
sections. The primer sequences of human miR-432 and
small nuclear RNA U6 were synthesized by GeneCopoeia,
Inc. and its expression was measured using SYBR
PrimescriptmiRNA RT-PCR kit and SYBR® Green I
(TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The universal small nuclear RNA U6 was
used as an endogenous control for miRNAs. Total RNA
extraction from cultured cells and the quantification of
E2F3 and AXL was performed as described before [30].
Melting analysis of the PCR products was conducted to
validate the amplification of the specific product. The
primers of target genes were as followings: E2F3 (F):
5ʹ- CAGGCTGGTTTCGGAAATGC -3ʹ, E2F3 (R):
5ʹ- TGGA CTTCGTAGTGCAGCTC -3ʹ; AXL (F): 5ʹCGCACTTACAAGACTTGGTCC -3ʹ, E2F3 (R): 5ʹGCTTCGCAGGAGAAAGAGGA -3ʹ. GAPDH was used
as internal loading control and its primer sequences were:
GAPDH(F): 5ʹ- GCACCGTCAAGGC TGAGAAC-3ʹ,
GAPDH (R): 5ʹ- TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA -3ʹ.

ATGATTAA; Mutant AXL reverse primer: TTAATCAT
CTAGAATCAACCAGCATCTGATCTAGAATC. Human
E2F3 and AXL cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1
eukaryotic expression vectors.

miRNA target predictions, luciferase activity
assay and western blotting
Predicted targets for miRNAs and their target sites
were analyzed using TargetScan [31], and miRanda [31].
For reporter assays, HEK293T cells were transiently
transfected with pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA
target expression vectors with wild-type or mutant target
sequence together with miRNA mimics/inhibitor and
mimics/inhibitor control. Cell extracts were prepared
48 h after transfection, and the ratio of Renilla to firefly
luciferase was measured with the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp, Madison, WI,
USA). Anti-E2F3 (ab50917, Abcam), anti-AXL (ab37861,
Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (Cell signaling, Danvers, MA,
USA) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used in Western
blotting and the protocols was described previously [32].

Immunohistochemistry
IHC was performed as previously described [33].
IHC staining was done using the standardized labeled
streptavidin biotin (LSAB) kit (DakoCytomation,
Carpinteria, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The slides were incubated with rabbit
polyclonal anti-E2F3 antibody (1:100 dilution, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-AXL antibody (1:100 dilution,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or mouse monoclonal
anti-Ki67 antibody (1:100 dilution, Dako, Carpinteria,
CA, USA). The intensity of proteins staining in the
LAD samples was scored as previously described [34].
Shortly, immunostaining was defined as “high” if the
immunoreactivity was observed in 10% or more of the
cells in paraffin sections; tumors with lower percentages of
immunoreactive cells showed “low” immunostaining.

SiRNA transfection and plasmids
Indicated siRNA, vectors and miR-432 mimics/
inhibitor transfections were carried out using
Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The sequences of siRNA targeting E2F3
and AXL are as following:E2F3 (sense strand:5ʹCUGGACCUCAAACUGUUAAUU-3ʹ; anti-sense strand:
5ʹ-UUAACAGU UUGAGGUCCAGUU-3ʹ); AXL (sense
strand:5ʹ-GGCUCUCCAAGAAGAUCUAU U-3ʹ; antisense strand: 5ʹ-UUAACAGUUUGAGGUCCAGUU-3ʹ);
Non-specific negative control siRNAs were also used
(sense strand: 5ʹ-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCA CG-3ʹ; antisense strand: 5ʹ-UAGAUCUUCUUGGAGAGCCUU-3ʹ).
The mock group was defined as the one supplemented with
the transfection reagent only. The wild-type and mutants
E2F3 3ʹ-UTR and AXL 3ʹ-UTR were generated on the
miR-432 target recognition sites (seed sequences). Both
the wild-type and mutated 3ʹ-UTRs of E2F3 and AXL gene
were cloned into the pmirGLO dual luciferase reporter
vector using SacI and Xho I restriction sites. The primer
sequences used were defined as follows: E2F3 forward
primer: CGAGCTCGTTATGCTTCGTGTGA, the reverse
primer: CCCTCGAGGGACTTAGCCAGGAGATGAA.
Mutant E2F3 forward primer: TTCCTACCTTCTTCCT
GGTTGAGAGTATCATGAAGTA, Mutant E2F3 reverse
primer: TACTTCATGATACTCTCAACCAGGAAGAAG
GTAGGAA. AXL forward primer: CGAGCTCGCTAG
ATCCTAAGGGTC; AXL reverse primer: CCCTCGAG
GGACTTTGGTGTCTCTAGTTA. Mutant AXL forword
primer: GATTCTAGATCAGATGCTGGTTGATTCTAG

Flow cytometry analysis
For cell cycle analysis, cells were transfected
as indicated and treated with 5 g/mL of aphidicolin
(Sigma-21 Aldrich, Munich, Germany) for additional 24 h.
After fixation, A549 and H1299 cells were stained with
1 ml propidium iodide (0.1 mg/ml with 0.1% TritonX-100)
and incubated in the dark for 30 min. The samples were
analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA).

In vivo assays
Male Balb/c athymic nude mice at 6 weeks of
age were carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of

Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as the mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) from at least three independent
experiments. The differences between groups were
analyzed using Student’s t test when only two groups
were compared or using a one-way ANOVA when more
than two groups were compared. Correlations between
miR-432 expression with clinicopathological parameters
were evaluated by the Spearman’s test. The Kaplan–Meier
method was applied for the analysis of follow-up data.
The differences were considered statistically significant at
p < 0.05. All analyses were performed using GraphPad
software version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, CA).
