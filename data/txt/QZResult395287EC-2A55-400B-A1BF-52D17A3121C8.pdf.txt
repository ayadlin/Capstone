ABSTRACT
Gamabufotalin (CS-6), a main active compound isolated from Chinese medicine
Chansu, has been shown to strongly inhibit cancer cell growth and inflammatory
response. However, its effects on angiogenesis have not been known yet. Here, we
sought to determine the biological effects of CS-6 on signaling mechanisms during
angiogenesis. Our present results fully demonstrate that CS-6 could significantly
inhibit VEGF triggered HUVECs proliferation, migration, invasion and tubulogenesis
in vitro and blocked vascularization in Matrigel plugs impregnated in C57/BL6 mice as
well as reduced vessel density in human lung tumor xenograft implanted in nude mice.
Computer simulations revealed that CS-6 interacted with the ATP-binding sites of
VEGFR-2 using molecular docking. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that
CS-6 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 kinase and suppressed the
activity of VEGFR-2-mediated signaling cascades. Therefore, our studies demonstrated
that CS-6 inhibited angiogenesis by inhibiting the activation of VEGFR-2 signaling
pathways and CS-6 could be a potential candidate in angiogenesis-related disease
therapy.

they can transform into an active proliferative state if
stimulated by angiogenic factors from the tumors, then
grow, migrate and form new blood vessels, which offer
oxygen and nutrients to the tumors. Inducing angiogenesis
is one of the hallmarks of cancer. New blood vessels
infiltrate tumors, supplying them with oxygen and
nutrients, and offer a route for tumor metastasis. Studies
have shown that inhibition of ECs growth can block tumor
angiogenesis effectively [5–7]. Moreover, agents that
prevent the growth of a tumor’s blood vessels facilitate
the regression or dormancy of established tumors and antiangiogenesis treatment has been an extremely promising

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis is a complex process which includes
endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation, migration, basement
membrane degeneration and new tube formation. It
is required for a variety of physiologic processes like
development and reproduction. However, angiogenesis
also plays a vital role in the growth and spread of cancer
as an adequate blood supply, which is necessary for tumor
growth and invasion in normal tissues [1–4]. It is known
that endothelial cells are normally in a highly quiescent
state, and crucial to maintain vascular homeostasis. But

form of cancer therapy [8]. Therefore, inhibiting
angiogenesis may be an effective method for inhibiting
tumor growth and metastasis.
Angiogenesis is tightly controlled by the balance
of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF)
and angiogenin, etc [9]. Imbalanced pro-angiogenesis
stimulation would trigger pathologically angiogenic
diseases such as ischemic heart failure as well as cancer
progression. Among the pro-angiogenic factors, VEGF is
well known to play an important part in tumor biology and
more specifically, in the process of tumor angiogenesis,
as its expression has been detected in various malignant
human tumors, like breast, ovary, kidney, urinary
bladder, brain, lung and gastrointestinal tract tumors
[10]. VEGF is a family composed of five isoforms
denominated VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D
and placental growth factor (PlGF). Each of these factors
exerts its activity through binding to three high-affinity
transmembrane receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and
VEGFR3), and then promote angiogenesis through its
ability to stimulate the growth, migration and invasion
of endothelial cells [11–15]. Current evidence suggests
that the interaction between VEGF and VEGFR-1(Flt1)
plays a minor role in angiogenesis, while VEGFR-2 (Flk1/
KDR: VEGFR-2 also known as KDR in human and Flk1
in mouse) mediates the major angiogenic function of
VEGF [16, 17]. VEGFR-2 is strongly auto-phosphorylated
in tumors by elevated VEGF expression [18]. VEGF
binds to specific transmembrane receptors on ECs and
lymphatic vessels in endothelial cell [19, 20]. VEGFR-2
signaling activation induces the phosphorylation of
various downstream signal transduction mediators,
including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR,
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which
ultimately control processes critical to angiogenesis
such as endothelial cell proliferation, migration and
tubulogenesis [21–24]. Therefore, VEGF and VEGFR-2
become potential molecular targets for anti-angiogenic
tumor therapy. Several approaches have been taken to
block VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling pathways, such as
inhibition of endogenous VEGF release and prevention of
VEGF from binding to VEGFR-2 [25].
In recent years, some studies have revealed that
natural products which exist in the traditional Chinese
medicines [26], have the potential properties in treating
different types of cancers. Toad venom (called “Chansu”
in China) is a product of the skin gland of toads such
as Bufo bufo gargarizans etc [27, 28], which has
been widely used as a cardiotonic, diuretic, anodyne
and hemostatic agent [29]. Chansu has been used as
significant anticancer agents, amending the life quality
of cancer patients [30]. Recent experimental studies have
demonstrated that Chansu and its active compounds

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exhibit significant anti-tumor activity via the inhibition
of cell proliferation, induction of cell differentiation
and apoptosis, disruption of the cell cycle, inhibition
of angiogenesis, reversal of multidrug resistance, and
regulation of the immune response [31]. A previous
study suggests that Chansu could induce apoptosis of
cancer cells, such as human gastric cancer and bladder
cancer cells [32, 33]. Gamabufotalin (CS-6), a major
bufadienolide isolated from Chansu, had the high
content of 1.75%-5%, and significant anti-tumor activity.
It has been found that it is used for anti-inflammatory,
acesodyne and anti-neoplasti. Our previous studies also
found that CS-6 suppressed human lung cancer A549
cell proliferation, migration and invasion [34]. However,
potential influence of CS-6 in endothelial angiogenic
activity is totally unknown.
In this study, we have investigated the effects of
gamabufotalin (CS-6) on angiogenesis and characterized
the underlying molecular mechanisms. The antiangiogenesis properties of CS-6 were evaluated in vitro
using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
proliferation, migration and tube formation assays, ex vivo
by aortic ring assay and in vivo by matrigel plug assay
mouse models. Our results exhibited that CS-6 inhibited
VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in endothelial cells, which
suggesting that CS-6 could be used as a potential antiangiogenesis agent that targets VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling
pathways.

RESULTS
CS-6 inhibits VEGF-induced cell proliferation
of HUVECs
As an importance of proliferation for endothelial
angiogenesis and tumor growth [35], we firstly
investigated the influence of CS-6 (Fig. 1A) in human
endothelial cells proliferation. After treatment for
HUVECs with a range of CS-6 (0, 1, 10, 25, 50 and 75 nM)
for 12 h and 24 h and cell viability was determined by
MTT assay. The results revealed CS-6 has mild inhibition
for HUVECs proliferation and showed no obvious
cytotoxicity at low concentration (Fig. 1B).
We further determined whether CS-6 inhibited
VEGF-induced HUVECs cell growth using MTT assay. As
shown in Fig. 1C, the number of HUVECs stimulated with
VEGF for 24 h and 48 h increased about 1.25 folds and 1.9
folds, respectively. These results showed that CS-6 could
inhibit VEGF-induced cell growth in a dose-dependent
and time-dependent manner; however we observed
a greater inhibition by the CS-6 in VEGF stimulated
HUVECs proliferation in comparison with absence of
VEGF (Fig. 1C). Taken together, our data showed that
CS-6 was a potent inhibitor of VEGF-activated endothelial
cell proliferation.

CS-6 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2E). These results
suggest that CS-6 inhibited VEGF triggered HUVECs
motility by affecting cofilin activity and cell stress fibre
formation.

It is well appreciated the great contribution
of VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis in regulating endothelial
mitogenesis as well as migration [39]. Previous studies
indicated that blockage of VEGFR-2 activity could
significantly limit tumoral neo-angiogenesis process
[40]. Considering the CS-6 antagonizing VEGF
induced angiogenic effects, we assess the influence of
CS-6 on VEGF triggered VEGFR2 phosphorylation
and as data shown in Fig. 5A. As shown in Fig. 5A,
the addition of exogenous VEGF induced VEGFR-2
phosphorylation in two different phosphorylation sites
(Tyr951 and Tyr1175), and VEGFR-2 phosphorylation
at both Tyr951 and Tyr1175 was specifically suppressed
by treatment with CS-6 without affecting the overall
VEGFR-2 expression level. As expected, CS-6 limited
VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in a dosedependent manner. We hypothesized that CS-6 might
bind to VEGFR-2 and subsequently affect the interaction
between VEGF and VEGFR-2. To verify this possibility,
next, the computer docking simulations of the interaction
of CS-6 with VEGFR-2 were carried out. Molecular
docking studies predicted that CS-6 would bind at the
ATP binding site of VEGFR-2. As shown in Fig. 5C (a),
CS-6 forms five hydrogen bonds with the ATP binding
pocket of the VEGFR-2 kinase domain. The CO group
at the lactonic ring of CS-6 forms a hydrogen bond with
the backbone NH of Cys917. The OH group at the C14
position forms strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone
at Cxc1045 and Lys 866 simultaneously. Moreover, 3-OH
accepts two hydrogen bonds with the CO and NH residues
of Phe843. The result of MOLCAD surface modeling
indicated that the lactonic ring of CS-6 extends into the
deep hydrophobic cavity of the ATP-binding pocket of
VEGFR-2 (Fig. 5C, b). Moreover, we carried out CoIP experiment to further explore whether CS-6 could
interfere with the basis for VEGF-VEGFR-2 interaction.
As shown in Fig. 5B, both VEGF and VEGFR-2 were
detected in the resulting precipitates, indicating that
VEGF was associated with VEGFR-2. The expression of
phosphorTyr1175-VEGFR-2 was obviously reduced with the
treatment of CS-6, which was consistent with the result of
Western blotting analysis (Fig. 5B). These results showed
that CS-6 had little effect on VEGF-VEGFR-2 interaction,
but suppressed the activation of VEGFR-2.

CS-6 suppresses VEGF-induced anti-apoptosis
of HUVECs
Consistent with the findings of other investigators
that VEGF caused a marked decrease in the apoptosis of
HUVECs induced by serum deprivation, as indicated by
a VEGF-dependent decrease in cell-surface annexin V
binding [36]. We next investigated the effects of CS-6 on
VEGF caused anti-apoptosis in HUVECs using Annexin
V/propidium iodide assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
experimental group stimulated with VEGF decreased
the apoptosis of HUVECs induced by serum deprivation
from 8.6% in control cells to 4.3%, however, co-treated
with indicated doses CS-6 and VEGF can dramatically
increase cell apoptosis in HUVECs compared with VEGF
group, which suggests that CS-6 inhibits VEGF-induced
anti-apoptosis. We also detected the expression of three
key pro-apoptotic proteins (PARP and caspase-3/9), as
well as Bcl-2 and Bax protein by Western blot analysis.
CS-6 could markedly increase the expression levels of
the cleaved caspase-3/9 and PARP proteins, and reduce
the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax as compared with the VEGF group
(Fig. 3B).

CS-6 inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis
in vitro and ex vivo
One of the important steps during neo-angiogenesis
is the formation and merging of tubes produced by
endothelial cells forming a complex network of vessels
and capillaries [37, 38]. Furthermore, we examined
whether CS-6 inhibited VEGF-induced HUVECs tube
formation using an in vitro angiogenesis tube formation
assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, HUVECs were placed on the
surface of Matrigel, and VEGF (50 ng/mL) significantly
enhanced (p<0.001) the endothelial capillary like
structures comparing with solvent treated cells. However,
the VEGF effects were blocked by CS-6 treatment in the
doses indicated. These data indicated that CS-6 would
efficiently impair VEGF induced tube formation in
HUVECs.
We further examined the VEGF also induced
endothelial cell sprouting in a modified spheroid assay;
however, this response was significantly impaired by
CS-6 in endothelial cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, capillary
formation assay was carried out through mouse dorsal
aortas in ex vivo. After nine days of culture in matrigel, we
observed a significant increase in endothelial sprouts from
VEGF treated mouse aorta rings, while the microvessel
sprouting was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by
CS-6 treatment (Fig. 4C).

and MAPK pathways, which are critical for VEGF/
VEGFR-2-mediated angiogenesis. To be specific,
p-Erk1/2 and p-p38 were enhanced by VEGF treatment
while the expression level of Erk1/2 and p38 remained
unchanged, and CS-6 inhibited the phosphorylation of
Erk1/2 and p38 without affecting total Erk1/2 and p38
expression levels. CS-6 also reduces phosphorylation
levels of Akt at Ser473, which is a well-known
downstream target of VEGFR-2, however, has no effect
on total Akt level. Moreover, the action of CS-6 on PI3K
p85 was also examined.
Furthermore, in order to verify the anti-angiogenesis
effect of CS-6 is via VEGFR2, we next knocked down
VEGFR2 by siRNA, and performed endothelial
cell spheroids sprouting assay. As shown in Fig. 5E,
knockdown of VEGFR2 by siRNA considerably inhibited
endothelial cell sprouting in sol group and VEGF group
compared with non-siRNA knockdown in a modified
spheroid assay, however, there was no obvious difference
in CS-6-treatment group. These data indicated that the
anti-angiogenesis effect of CS-6 was through VEGFR2 in
HUVECs.

Taken all together, our results showed that
gamabufotalin (CS-6) exerted its anti-angiogenic effect
by suppressing VEGFR-2 activation.

DISCUSSION
Our previous study showed that gamabufotalin
(CS-6), in the nanomolar range, markedly reduced
cell proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells [34].
However, little is known about the inhibitory effects
of CS-6 on angiogenesis and associated molecular
mechanism. Angiogenesis is important for tumor growth,
maintenance and invasion. Tumor growth is initially
fed by nearby blood vessels, and new blood vessels
are required to support the growth when the tumor size
exceeds a certain size [42]. Therefore, Neo-angiogenesis
is the critical step in the development and progression of
most of the human cancers, and anti-angiogenic therapy
of cancer treatment is a new method for cancer treatment.
In previous study, we found that CS-6 reduced
cell growth in several human lung cancer cell lines
(IC50 was about 55 nM), while had no adverse effect on
human normal lung cell line (HLF cells). The interesting
observation may suggest that CS-6 would be more
favor to affect tumor cell viability, while whether or
not it potentially influencing endothelial angiogenesis
during tumor development is totally unknown. Herein,
we presented in current study that CS-6 showed minor
inhibitory effects (IC50 was more than 200 nM) on
HUVECs, a similar phenomena observed in previous
tests of normal human lung cells; however, CS-6 would
remarkably inhibit VEGF induced endothelial growth,
suggesting it may interact VEGF signaling as well
corresponding endothelial bio-function. Indeed, we found
that CS-6 could inhibit angiogenesis in vitro, ex vivo and
in vivo, and suppress key steps related to angiogenesis,
including proliferation, survival, migration and
angiogenesis in endothelial cells. However, we noticed
the anti-angiogenic effective doses of CS-6 among cell
cultures (10, 25 and 50 nM), aortic tissue cultures (500
and 1000 nM) as well animal levels (1000 and 5000 nM)
are different, which may be resulted from varied growth
environments or complex background. In order to exclude
the possibility that toxicity of CS-6 would give raise to
false positive phenomenon on endothelial angiogenesis,
we well controlled these issues. For example, the doses
of CS-6 used in cell cultures were no clear toxic effects
determined by MTT assay; in aortic ring tissue cultures,
we did not observed CS-6 increased apoptotic endothelial
cells by PI staining. Further investigation showed that
CS-6 inhibited angiogenesis via suppressing of VEGFinduced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and activation by
targeting the ATP-binding site of VEGFR-2. Here, to the
best of our knowledge, it is the first time to reveal that
CS-6 inhibits angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.

CS-6 inhibits VEGF-induced blood vessel
formation in mice
To confirm our findings in vivo, we assess the
impacts of CS-6 on endothelial angiogenesis in lung
cancer xenografts model as well as martrigel plugs.
model. Our previous study has shown that CS-6 inhibited
the growth of lung cancer xenografts in nude mice [34].
Herein, we further examined the vessel density in lung
cancer tissue sections visualized using VE-cadherin
staining (Red) under immunofluorescent microscope.
We chose VE-cadherin because of its modulation of
angiogenesis [41], and its expression could reflect the
microvessel density in the tissues. Direct inhibition of VEcadherin function could impact other signaling functions
such as modulation of VEGF receptor signaling. As shown
in Fig. 6A, the micro-vessel density identified by VEcadherin staining was significantly decreased with CS-6
treatment, as compared with the vehicle group. However,
we could not exclude possibility that the CS-6 treatment
impaired vessel density in the human xenograft was due to
the tumor suppressive role of CS-6. To clarify this issue,
we further applied matrigel plug assay. After 7 days,
matrigel plugs containing VEGF excised from mice were
dark red and filled with blood vessels. In contrast, matrigel
plugs containing both VEGF and CS-6 were light yellow.
The group treated with 5 μM CS-6 was nearly transparent
(Fig. 6B). We then used FITC-isolectin and DAPI to
stain and quantify the number of functional vessels in the
matrigel plugs. As shown in Fig. 6C, fewer vessels were
observed in the matrigel plugs treated with both VEGF
and CS-6 than in those plugs treated with VEGF alone.
These results indicate that CS-6 can significantly inhibit
angiogenesis in vivo.

It has been well documented that Cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), as one of the VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling
client proteins, plays a central role in the modulation
of angiogenesis, and our previous study found CS-6
suppressed COX-2 expression in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells. Therefore, we investigate whether
CS-6 inhibit angiogenesis was associated COX-2
expression. We discovered CS-6 would not affect COX2 expression in HUVECs in basal culture condition;
however, it was able to specifically reduce VEGFinduced elevation of COX-2 in endothelial cells (Data not
shown). It demonstrated CS-6 performs clearly different

mechanism in regulating COX-2 expression in endothelial
cell as a downstream event of VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling
with the transcriptional regulation in NSCLC.
Tumor growth depends on angiogenesis and antiangiogenic therapy is a new therapeutic approach for
cancer treatment. Previous research indicates that VEGF/
VEGFR-2 signaling pathway is the main cascade involved
in angiogenesis growth, and Erk1/2 and PI3K/Akt
pathways could regulate VEGF expression [43]. VEGFR-2
activation stimulates complex signaling networks with
distinct and overlapping functions, including MAPK
and PI3K/Akt pathways, which play important roles in

vascular endothelial cell growth, survival and migration.
In this study, we showed that CS-6 suppressed PI3K/
Akt and MAPK signaling pathways through inhibiting
VEGFR-2 activation by targeting the ATP-binding site.
VEGF and its high-affinity receptor VEGFR-2
are the most widely studied factors in angiogenesis.
Targeting of VEGFR-2 is an intriguing strategy in the
anti-angiogenic therapy of tumors [44], which is essential
for the functions of vascular endothelial cells. Thus,
we studied whether CS-6 could inhibit VEGF-induced
VEGFR-2 activation. In the present study, CS-6 was
shown to inhibit VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation
of VEGFR-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover,
computational docking showed that CS-6 occupied
the deep hydrophobic pocket in the ATP-binding site
of VEGFR-2. In this modeling analysis, five hydroxyl
groups bound to the ATP-binding pocket of VEGFR-2
via forming five hydrogen bonds. The CO motif at the
lactonic ring of CS-6 forms hydrogen bond with Cys917
of the hinge region of VEGFR-2 [45]. Residue Cys917
is a crucial amino acid for ligand reorganization and
binding on the ATP site as reported. The hydroxyl group
at the C-14 position of cs6 bound to the ATP-binding
pocket of VEGFR-2 via forming two hydrogen bonds
with residues Lys866 and Cxc1045 of the polar region.
These hydrogen bond interactions were important for
improvement the binding affinity of CS-6 to VEGFR-2
[46]. The additional hydrogen bond interactions of CS-6
with Phe843 stabilized its occupation of the hydrophobic
pocket of VEGFR-2. These above data suggest that CS-6
may inhibit angiogenesis by targeting VEGFR-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
Gamabufotalin (CS-6) was isolated from ChanSu in
our lab, which was secreted from the postauricular and
skin glands of Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor [34]. In our
study, CS-6 was dissolved in DMSO as a 100 μM stock
solution and diluted in the relevant assay media and kept
at −20°C. CS-6 was diluted in culture medium to obtain
the desired concentration, which was stable in the dilution
with DMSO concentration less than 1‰.

Cell proliferation assay
HUVECs viability was measured by MTT assay.
Briefly, HUVECs were seeded at 8 × 103 cells/well in 96well plates, and allowed to adhere to obtain 80% confluent
monolayer. The medium was replaced with normal growth
medium containing CS-6 (0, 1, 10, 25, 50 and 75 nM).
After 12 h or 24 h incubation, the growth of cells was
measured at 490 nm using an EnSpire® Multimode
Plate Reade (Perkin Elmer, USA). The effect of CS-6
on VEGF-induced cell viability was measured by MTT
assay. HUVECs (6 × 103 cells/well) were respectively
treated with or without VEGF (50 ng/mL) or various
concentration of CS-6 (0, 10, 25 and 50 nM) for 24 h and
48 h, and then cell growth was measured. In control cells,
equivalent amount of DMSO was added as vehicle. The
number of viable cells was presented relative to untreated
controls.

Wound healing migration assay

sprouts were evaluated by measuring the cumulative
length of all capillary like sprouts using a Leica
DM14000B microscope. At least 5 randomly selected
spheroids per experimental group and experiment were
analyzed. And sprout length was measured with Image J
software.

HUVECs were allowed to grow into full confluence
in 6-well plates. A line of HUVECs was then scraped
away in each well using a pipette tip after 6h of serum
starvation. Subsequently, cells were washed twice to
remove detached cells. Fresh M199 medium containing
different concentrations of CS-6 (0, 10, 25 and 50 nM)
or vehicle, with or without 50 ng/mL VEGF was added
to the scratched monolayers. Images were taken using a
Leica DM 14000B microscope after 12 h incubation. The
migrated cells were observed from three randomly chosen
fields and quantified by manual counting. Inhibition
percentage was expressed as percentage of the untreated
cells (100%).

Aortic ring assay
Aorta from C57/BL6 mice were removed, cleaned
and approximate 1mm aortic rings were embedded in
a collagen gel (collagen type I, BD Biosciences) in a
48 well plate , After gel polymerization, DMEM/F12
medium (HyClone) supplemented with 2.5% mouse
serum. Additional VEGF (50 ng/mL) and CS-6 (500
nM and 1000 nM) were added and the endothelial
sprouts were allowed to develop over 9 days. Thereafter,
the samples were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde) and
endothelial cells were visualized using FITC-Lectin
(Sigma) staining under immunofluorescent microscope.
The results were the means calculated from five replicates
of each experiment.

Endothelial cell transwell invasion assay
The motility of HUVECs was performed in 24-well
transwell plates [48]. The upper surface of polycarbonate
filters with 8 μm pores was coated with 75 μL Matrigel
(Matrigel: M199=1:3, without growth factors) and
incubated for 0.5 h at 37°C for gelling. Then, Cells were
seeded into the upper chambers at a density of 5 × 104 cells
per chamber, the bottom chamber were filled with 600 μL
M199 with 10% FBS supplemented with VEGF (50 ng/
mL) or vehicle. Both top and bottom chamber contained
the same concentrations of CS-6. After 24 h incubation,
non-invasive cells on the upper membrane surfaces were
removed by wiping with cotton swabs. Invaded cells were
fixed with methanol and stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet
Staining Solution. The membrane was dried in the air.
Images were taken using a Leica DM 14000B microscope.
Cell invasion counted in five independent areas per
membrane. The results were the means calculated from
five replicates of each experiment.

Matrigel plug assay
All animals were maintained, and animal
experiments were done in SPF Laboratory Animal Center
at Dalian Medical University. The animals used in this
research were 6 weeks old male C57/BL6 mice (three
mice per group). Matrigel (0.5 mL/plug) containing
250 ng VEGF and 80 units heparin with various
concentrations of CS-6 (1 or 5 μM) were injected (S.C.)
into near the axillary fossa of mice. Matrigel mixed with
medium alone was used as a negative control. After 9
days of implantation, the matrigel plugs were removed
and the surrounding tissues were trimmed. The matrigel
plugs were embedded with O.C.T. Compound (Sakura
Finetek USA, Inc.). Ten-micron sections were stained
by FITC-Lectin (Sigma) staining. The number of blood
vessels in high power field (HPF, magnification) was
counted under immunofluorescent microscope. The
results were the means calculated from five replicates
of each experiment.

Tube formation assay
HUVECs [1 × 104 in 50 μL M199 medium with
0.1% BSA containing CS-6 (0, 10, 25, 50 nM)] were
seeded on Ibitreat angiogenesis slides (Ibidi, Martinsried,
Germany) pre-coated with 10 μL Matrigel, and the
formation of tubular like structure was recorded by a Leica
DM14000B microscope at 6 hours or 24 hours.

Microvessel density assay by VE-cadherin
staining

Endothelial cell spheroids sprouting assay

Human lung xenografts samples were from our
previous study [34]. 4μm sections were stained with VEcadherin (1:200, Santa Cruz, sc-6458) and DAPI (1:5000).
The endothelial staining was photographed under
immunofluorescent microscope and vessel density was
evaluated by Image J software. The results were shown as
Mean ± SD from at least 5 tumor samples for each group.
The tumor sections were from three treatment groups that
each contained five mice.

Spheroids were generated by gravity as described
[47]. Subsequently, spheroids were harvested by 5 min
centrifugation at 1000 rpm and embedded into a collagen
gel (containing collagen (1 mg/mL); 1x M199 (sigma);
0.22% NaHCO3) with pH at 7.4 adjusted by 0.1 N NaOH.
The spheroid-containing gel was rapidly transferred
into a 24-well plate and allowed to polymerize at 37°C
incubators for 30 min, M199 medium with or without
VEGF and CS-6 was applied on top of the gel. Spheroids

Molecular modeling

Actin filaments were stained by phalloidin-FITC
for 20 min, and nuclei were detected by DAPI. For
phosphorcofilin immunofluorescence, cells were blocked
with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h. After washing three
times with PBS, cells were incubated with antibody
against phospho-cofilin overnight at 4°C, and then with
secondary antibodies for another 1 h at room temperature.
Next, cell nuclei were stained by DAPI for 5 min. The
slides were examined with a Leica DM 14000B confocal
microscope.

Docking studies were performed to explore
the potential binding interactions between CS-6 and
VEGFR-2. The compound CS-6 was optimized using
the semi-empirical PM3 method with the Polak-Ribie‘re
conjugate gradient algorithm with an RMS gradient
of 0.001 kcal mol−1 Å−1 as convergence criterion. The
optimized structure was further docked into the active site
of VEGFR-2 (PDB Code: 1YWN). The crystallographic
ligand was extracted from the active site, and the residues
within a 6.5 Å radius around the VEGFR-2 molecule were
defined as the active site. The Surflex-Dock program was
used for the docking calculations with default parameters.
MOLCAD surfaces were generated for visualizing the
binding mode of the docked protein–ligand complexes.

Western blotting
To determine the effects of CS-6 on VEGFR-2dependent signaling cascade, starved HUVECs were
treated with CS-6 for 6 h, followed by 50ng/mL VEGF165
treatments for 1 h. Cells were lysed with an appropriate
cold lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China)
supplemented with proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma,
USA). Protein concentrations were determined using a
BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China).
Proteins (50 μg) were applied to 8% to 12% SDSPAGE gels and transferred onto a PVDF membrance
(Millipore, USA). The membranes were incubated with
specific primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected
using an enhanced chemiluminescence method. Bands
were normalized with GAPDH or β-actin as an internal
control. Similar experiments were performed at least
three times.

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
In order to determine the effect of CS-6 on the
interaction between VEGFR-2 and VEGF, HUVECs
were incubated in M199 with 0.5% FBS for 6 h followed
by treating with CS-6 for 4 h, followed by 50 ng/mL
VEGF165 treatments for 1 h. Briefly, cell extract proteins
(500 μg) were pre-cleared by adding 1 μg normal rabbit
IgG and 40 μL protein A/G-Agarose beads. Together,
they were incubated at 4°C for 1 h with gentle agitation
and centrifuge. The supernatants were collected and
incubated with a specific rabbit anti-VEGFR-2 antibody
at 4°C overnight with gentle rotary agitation. The immune
complexes were pulled down by protein A/G agarose
beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed with
ice-cold PBS buffer containing proteinase inhibitor for
3 times. After final wash, the immune complexes were
released by boiling in 2 × electrophoresis sample buffer
for 5 min, followed by western blotting analysis with
rabbit anti-VEGFR-2, rabbit anti-phosphoTyr1175-VEGFR-2
and mouse anti-VEGF antibodies.

Statistical analysis
Data are represented as mean ± SD obtained
for at least three independent experiments. Statistical
significance was determined by one-way ANOVA.
P<0.05 was considered to be a statistically significant
difference. SPSS 17.0 software was used for all
statistical analysis. The mean density of the interest
bands (where mentioned) was determined using Scion
Image software.

Cell apoptosis analysis
Cell apoptosis analyses were carried out by
fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). After treatment,
the cells were harvested by 0.25% trypsin and washed by
PBS buffer and then stained simultaneously with FITClabeled annexin V and PI. Stained cells were analyzed
using FACS Accuri C6.

CONCLUSION
We demonstrated for the first time that CS-6 as
a natural bufadienolide, exhibited the significant antiangiogenesis effect by inhibiting proliferation, migration,
invasion, tube formation and enhancing apoptosis
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a dosedependent manner. Moreover, its molecular mechanisms
inhibiting angiogenesis are mainly mediated through
suppressing the VEGF/VEGFR-2-mediated signaling
cascades by targeting ATP binding site, inactivating PI3K/
Akt and MAPK pathways. From the above, these findings
strongly demonstrate that CS-6 could serve as a potential
candidate for anti-angiogenic therapy and a potent
inhibitor of VEGFR-2-activated.

F-actin staining and immunofluorescence
analysis
HUVECs were seeded onto coverslips in a 6-well
plate. The cells were treated with or without 50 μM
CS-6 for 1h and then were stimulated with 50 ng/mL
VEGF for 15min. After that, the cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and then permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature.
