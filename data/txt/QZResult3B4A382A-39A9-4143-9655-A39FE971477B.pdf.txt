ABSTRACT
Recent evidence suggests that glutamate signaling plays an important role
in cancer. Riluzole is a glutamate release inhibitor and FDA-approved drug for the
treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It has been investigated as an inhibitor
of cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis with the intention of repurposing it for the
treatment of cancer. Riluzole is thought to act by indirectly inhibiting glutamate
signaling. However, the specific effects of riluzole in breast cancer cells are not well
understood. In this study, the anti-cancer effects of riluzole were explored in a panel
of breast cancer cell lines in comparison to the metabotropic glutamate receptor
1-specific inhibitor BAY 36-7620. While both drugs inhibited breast cancer cell
proliferation, there were distinct functional effects suggesting that riluzole action
may be metabotropic glutamate receptor 1-independent. Riluzole induced mitotic
arrest independent of oxidative stress while BAY 36-7620 had no measurable effect on
mitosis. BAY 36-7620 had a more pronounced and significant effect on DNA damage
than riluzole. Riluzole altered cellular metabolism as demonstrated by changes in
oxidative phosphorylation and cellular metabolite levels. These results provide a
better understanding of the functional action of riluzole in the treatment of breast
cancer.

strategy. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated
ion channels and contain four classes of receptors (AMPA,
NMDA, kainate, and delta receptors). Metabotropic
glutamate receptors, a family of seven-transmembrane G
protein-coupled receptors, are divided into three groups
based on sequence homology and functional similarities.
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1), a member of
group I, regulates synaptic signaling in the CNS. At least
four GRM1 variants (mGluR1a, b, d, and g) have been
detected due to alternative splicing of the gene transcript,
and they encode for proteins with 1195, 906, 908, and
887 amino acids, respectively. All variants share the first

INTRODUCTION
Although glutamate signaling was initially
characterized in central nervous system (CNS)
development and synaptic transmission, its importance
in tumorigenesis in multiple organs is becoming better
defined [1–6]. Breast, melanoma, and prostate cancer
cell lines and human prostate tumors have been shown
to release glutamate [7, 8] as well as express glutamate
receptors [9]. Efforts have focused on targeting
ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors and
their downstream pathways as an anti-cancer therapeutic

886 N-terminal amino acids but have distinct C-terminal
regions.
Though GRM1 was initially functionally
characterized in CNS biology, its importance in
tumorigenesis in organ systems outside of the CNS has
become better defined. GRM1 was first recognized for
its oncogenic potential after a transgenic mouse model
presented with spontaneous melanomas [10]. This resulted
because of a transgene insertion into intron 3 of GRM1
leading to ectopic GRM1 expression. Activation of GRM1
by its natural ligand glutamate or glutamate receptor
agonists alters its interactions with G proteins. These
interactions lead to stimulation of second messengers and
induction of protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase
C (PLC) and intracellular calcium release with resultant
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and Akt pathways.
As the drug riluzole blocks glutamate release
[11, 12], it indirectly affects glutamate signaling by
both autocrine and paracrine actions. In vitro data with
melanoma cells suggest that riluzole causes increased
intracellular glutamate levels under glutamate and
glutamine-free conditions [13]. Exchange of intracellular
glutamate for extracellular cystine occurs through the
action of the x-C-type transporter (xCT). As the precursor
of intracellular cysteine, cystine is necessary to replenish
glutathione. Thus, it follows that riluzole treatment could
lead to increased oxidative stress, DNA damage, and
cell death. Similar mechanisms have not been evaluated
for the noncompetitive GRM1 inhibitor BAY 36-7620
where BAY 36-7620-induced receptor inhibition results
in reduced glutamate release [14]. Therefore, if the
functional mechanism of both drugs is through inhibition
of glutamate release and glutamate signaling through
GRM1, then functional effects would also be similar.
Both riluzole and BAY 36-7620 negatively regulate
the MAPK and Akt signaling pathways in melanoma cell
lines, effectively inhibiting cell growth, proliferation, and
invasion [14–16]. A phase 0/I trial of riluzole in patients
with stage III/IV melanoma demonstrated a correlation
between reduced extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK) and Akt phosphorylation with reduction in tumor
size [17]. Additionally, combined riluzole and ionizing
radiation treatment in GRM1-expressing melanoma cell
lines and melanoma xenografts in mice yielded synergistic
suppression of cell growth and tumor progression as
compared to radiation alone [18, 19].
Growing evidence supports the role of glutamate
signaling in breast cancer. Consistent with higher GRM1
expression in malignant as compared to normal prostate
tissue [20], a significantly higher fraction of human breast
tumors express GRM1 as compared to normal breast tissue
[1]. Moreover, treatment of estrogen receptor positive
(ER+) MCF-7 xenografts with riluzole alone and with
an Akt inhibitor suppresses tumor growth in vivo [21].
Others have also shown that pharmacologic modulation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

glutamate signaling in ER negative, progesterone receptor
negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) negative breast cancer cells induces apoptosis,
inhibits angiogenesis, and reduces tumor cell growth in
vitro and in vivo [4–6]. These data suggest that riluzole
may hold promise as a novel therapeutic agent for the
treatment of cancer including all molecular subtypes of
breast cancer [1, 4-6, 21].
The cellular and molecular consequences of
pharmacologic modulation of glutamate signaling
pathways have not yet been fully elucidated in the setting
of breast cancer. Nor is the functional target of riluzole
fully understood. For example, glutamate plays a critical
role in cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic disruption
of glutamate levels, e.g. through altered conversion to
α-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle, can subsequently
alter cell bioenergetics, biochemical equilibrium,
and metabolic activity affecting cancer cell survival.
However, the potential role of riluzole in altering cancer
cell metabolism is currently unknown. Moreover, riluzole
effects may be tissue-specific due to differing molecular
alterations and pathway dysregulation. Therefore, a study
was undertaken to investigate the functional actions of
riluzole, in comparison to the known noncompetitive
GRM1 inhibitor BAY 36-7620, on a molecularly diverse
panel of breast cancer cells. This panel of breast cancer
cell lines was treated with each glutamate signaling
modulator, and the functional effects on cell proliferation,
gene expression, cell cycle alterations, DNA damage, and
cell metabolism were evaluated.

RESULTS
Breast cancer cell lines express GRM1
ER positive and negative breast cancer cell lines
were evaluated for GRM1 expression by Western blot
(Figure 1). Each cell line expressed GRM1 but expression
was variable across this molecularly distinct set of cell
lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and BT-549 had high
expression of GRM1; T-47D, BT-474, and Hs578T had
low expression (Table 1).

Riluzole and BAY 36-7620 inhibit breast cancer
cell growth
GRM1 has previously been reported to play a role
in breast cancer cell growth and proliferation [1, 4]. To
determine the effects of these drugs on cell growth, ER+
and ER- breast cancer cell lines were treated with either
riluzole or BAY 36-7620 for 72 h. Both drugs inhibited
the number of viable cells in all cell lines (Figure 2A and
2B). IC50 values for riluzole and BAY 36-7620 ranged
from 19.0-62.4 μM and 15.7-41.0 μM, respectively
(Table 1). BT-474, Hs578T, and BT-549 cells were the
most sensitive to both drugs while MDA-MB-231 cells

were the least sensitive. BAY 36-7620 at the highest
concentrations completely inhibited cell growth. At the
highest concentrations evaluated, riluzole inhibited cell
growth by 70-90% compared to control.

altered by either drug to better understand their mechanism
of action. These cell lines were included to compare cells
with a range of sensitivity to riluzole or BAY 36-7620 with
BT-549 being the most sensitive and MCF-7 being the least
sensitive. As BT-549 and BT-474 cells are more sensitive
to cell death by both drugs, these cell lines were treated
for 24 h, whereas the less sensitive MCF-7 cells were
treated for 48 h. Overall, riluzole or BAY 36-7620 induced
similar gene signature profiles for each of the three cell
lines as compared to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control
(Figure 4A). However, differential expression signatures
were observed for riluzole as compared to BAY 36-7620.
For example, BAY 36-7620, but not riluzole, induced the
cholesterol biosynthesis gene signature in MCF-7 and
BT-474 cells. Expression signatures for cell cycle genes
showed significant decreases in gene expression by both
drugs in comparison to DMSO control in MCF-7 and BT549 cell lines (Figure 4A and 4B, Supplementary Table
1). There are trends of activation of oncogenic pathways
such as signatures for hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha
(HIF1-α), RAS, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) and alteration of
tumor suppressor pathways such as signatures for p53 and
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). There is also
a trend toward inactivation of the Myc targets signature
which is consistent with the observed reduction in cell
proliferation (Figure 3). Regarding metabolic signatures,
a trend toward up-regulation of TFEB targets is observed

Treatment with riluzole or BAY 36-7620 inhibits
cell proliferation
Since both drugs reduced cell number, their effect on
proliferation was determined as measured by 5-ethynyl2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation. The percentage of
proliferating cells was decreased in each breast cancer
cell line by riluzole or BAY 36-7620 (Figure 3). However,
no association between the anti-proliferative effect of
riluzole or BAY 36-7620 and GRM1 levels was observed.
T-47D, BT-474, and BT-549 cells were significantly
more sensitive to BAY 36-7620 than to riluzole at the
concentration evaluated suggesting that BAY 36-7620 has
a more potent effect on cell proliferation. Notably, the low
GRM1-expressors were still very sensitive to riluzole or
BAY 36-7620 implying that there may be off-target effects
for each drug.

Riluzole and BAY 36-7620 alter gene expression
signatures in cell cycle and oncogenic pathways
Gene expression analysis of MCF-7, BT-474, and
BT-549 cells was done to identify gene sets in pathways

and UACC930 (GRM1 C-terminal truncation) melanoma cells were included as a positive and negative control, respectively, for GRM1
expression at the predicted molecular weight (MW) of 132 kilodaltons (kDa). β-actin served as a loading control.

in MCF-7 cells treated with riluzole and BT-549 cells
treated with either drug, suggesting induction of lysosomal
biogenesis and activation of autophagy. Riluzole increased
the cell migration gene signature in MCF-7 cells but
decreased it in BT-549 cells. It is important to note that
differences in gene expression profiles across cell lines
may be due to cell line heterogeneity. BT-474 cells are
HER2+ and may be under higher replicative stress
which may contribute to the variability in a subset of the
expression profiles between cell lines.
Gene microarray results were validated using
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on
a subset of genes found to be up- or down-regulated. A
set of cell cycle regulated genes (CDKN1A, CDKN2C,
CCNE2) were validated since both riluzole and BAY 36-

7620 induced alterations in expression signatures for cell
cycle genes and because of the previously observed effects
of riluzole on G2/M arrest [21]. Additionally, SLC7A11
gene expression was validated as this gene encodes for the
glutamate antiporter xCT. Finally, expression of ASNS, a
gene that encodes for the metabolic enzyme asparagine
synthetase, was confirmed as glutamate is an important
metabolic factor. Comparison between microarray analysis
and qRT-PCR showed that the direction of change in
gene expression was concordant among all genes tested
in BT-549 and BT-474 cells and several genes in MCF7 cells (Figure 4B and 4C, Supplementary Table 2,
Supplementary Figure 1). However, the fold changes that
were dissimilar between the two methods may be, in part,
due to inherent differences between the methods.

Riluzole more strongly induces G2/M cell cycle
arrest than BAY 36-7620

histone H3 was utilized as a marker of mitosis. Riluzole
significantly increased the number of phospho-H3 stained
cells compared to control in all cell lines suggesting
that riluzole induced mitotic arrest (Figure 6A and 6B).
In contrast, BAY 36-7620 exhibited variable cell linedependent effects. BAY 36-7620 significantly decreased
the number of phospho-H3 stained cells in MCF-7, T-47D
and BT-549 cells while a modest increase was observed in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6A and 6B).
Breast cancer cells treated with riluzole or BAY 367620 were also investigated for changes in known markers
for mitosis. Riluzole significantly decreased phosphocdc2 in MCF-7, T-47D, Hs578T, and BT-549 cells and
significantly increased cyclin B1 in Hs578T cells with
a trend toward increase in T-47D, BT-474, and BT-549
cells (Figure 6C, Supplementary Figure 2). This supports
a role for riluzole in induction of mitotic arrest. BAY 367620 only decreased phospho-cdc2 in MCF-7, T-47D,
Hs578T, and BT-549 cells at higher, more cytotoxic
concentrations and did not increase cyclin B levels (Figure
6C, Supplementary Figure 2). The effects of riluzole on
phospho-H3, phospho-cdc2, and cyclin B1 suggest that
riluzole induces mitotic arrest within G2/M arrest whereas

Effects of riluzole and BAY 36-7620 on cell cycle
distribution were investigated. Each breast cancer cell line
treated with riluzole showed a significant dose- and timedependent induction of G2/M arrest (Figure 5). BT-474
and BT-549 cells were most sensitive to riluzole with an
increase in the sub G1 population as early as 48 h and 24
h respectively (Figure 5E and 5I). BAY 36-7620 induced
a more modest G2/M arrest in T-47D, BT-474, MDAMB-231, and BT-549 cell lines (Figure 5D-5J) but had no
effect in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5A and 5B) as compared to
riluzole. Although both riluzole and BAY 36-7620 inhibited
proliferation, more pronounced G2/M arrest by riluzole
may implicate other targets beyond those of BAY 36-7620.

Riluzole but not BAY 36-7620 induces mitotic
arrest in breast cancer cells

treatment induces G2 arrest or mitotic arrest in breast
cancer cells, the fraction of cells with phosphorylation of

BAY 36-7620 had a minimal effect on both G2/M arrest
and more specifically mitotic arrest.

Riluzole-induced cell cycle arrest is independent
of oxidative stress

DNA damage is observed after treatment with
BAY 36-7620

It has been hypothesized that riluzole induces
oxidative stress due to reduced antiport of glutamate
and cystine via xCT, leading to depletion of glutathione
stores then DNA damage in melanoma cells [24]. To
evaluate if riluzole or BAY 36-7620 increased oxidative
stress in breast cancer cells, levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and total intracellular glutathione (GSH)
were evaluated. BAY 36-7620 significantly increased
ROS in T-47D and BT-474 ER+ breast cancer cell
lines, while riluzole resulted in significantly increased
ROS only in BT-474 cells (Figure 8A). Although the
increase in ROS by BAY 36-7620 was not statistically
significant in MCF-7 cells, the trend was similar to the
other two ER+ cell lines. When comparing the two
drugs, the increase in ROS was significantly higher with
BAY 36-7620 as compared with riluzole. Neither drug
significantly increased ROS in ER- cells. Interestingly,

DNA damage is known to result in G2/M arrest
within the cell cycle [22, 23]. To determine whether riluzole
or BAY 36-7620 induces DNA damage as a potential
cause of G2/M arrest, phosphorylation of histone H2AX
(γ-H2AX) was evaluated as a well-described marker of
DNA damage, specifically DNA double strand breaks. All
breast cancer cell lines treated with either riluzole or BAY
36-7620 had an increased percentage of cells positive for
γ-H2AX foci as detected by immunofluorescence (Figure
7A). However, BAY 36-7620 induced a significantly more
robust H2AX phosphorylation than riluzole. Increased
γ-H2AX nuclear foci after drug treatment can be seen in
representative images from an ER+ (MCF-7) and ER(MDA-MB-231) cell line (Figure 7B).

Figure 6: Riluzole induces mitotic arrest in breast cancer cells. ER+ (A) and ER- (B) breast cancer cells were treated with 50

μM riluzole or 50 μM BAY 36-7620 for 48 h. Cells were stained with an antibody specific to phospho-histone H3 at Ser10 (phospho-H3) as
a marker for mitosis and detected by flow cytometry. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. *P < 0.05 compared to DMSO control. **P <

cycle arrest in MCF-7, T-47D, BT-474, and BT-549 cells
suggesting that riluzole exerts its effect independent of
ROS generation (Figure 8D).

there was a modest decrease in ROS in MDA-MB-231
treated with BAY 36-7620 and Hs578T ER- cell lines
treated with either riluzole or BAY 36-7620. Total
glutathione (GSH) levels decreased after riluzole or
BAY 36-7620 treatment in BT-474 and Hs578T cells
while no significant effect was observed in the other cell
lines (Figure 8B). Both cell lines have relatively low
GRM1 protein levels suggesting that drug treatment may
affect other glutamate receptor targets.
To determine whether riluzole-mediated cell cycle
arrest is dependent on induction of oxidative stress, cells
were pretreated with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine
(NAC). As a positive control for ROS, MCF-7 cells
were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This led to
induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest which was prevented
by pretreatment with NAC (Figure 8C). However, NAC
pretreatment did not prevent riluzole-induced G2/M cell

Riluzole alters cellular metabolism
Riluzole has been shown to alter intracellular
glutamate levels. As glutamate is a critical component of
the citric acid cycle, metabolic alterations were evaluated
as a possible contributor to riluzole-induced cell cycle
arrest. BT-474 cells were used because this cell line
is particularly sensitive to riluzole with respect to cell
cycle arrest compared to other cell lines tested. Oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) was evaluated at short and long
time intervals as a measure of oxidative phosphorylation
in riluzole-treated cells. OCR was unchanged after 4
h treatment, but levels of oxidative phosphorylation

significantly decreased after 24 h riluzole treatment
compared to control suggesting that riluzole inhibits
oxidative metabolism in this breast cancer cell line (Figure
9A). To investigate the immediate effect of riluzole on
oxidative phosphorylation, BT-474 cells were treated with
riluzole followed by real-time detection of OCR at short
intervals. Riluzole induced an immediate reduction in
OCR and inhibition of return to basal OCR levels over the
time frame evaluated as compared to control (Figure 9B).
To identify which key metabolic pathways were
altered, water-soluble metabolites from riluzole-treated
BT-474 cells were measured by liquid chromatography–
mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Cells treated with riluzole
have a significantly altered metabolic profile, i.e.
riluzole induced a greater than two-fold increase in the
cellular levels of several nucleotides and nucleosides
(Supplementary Table 3). Intermediary nucleoside levels
are the most significantly increased upon riluzole treatment
suggesting altered purine and pyrimidine catabolism
(Figure 9C and 9D). Furthermore, N-carbamoyl-aspartate,
an intermediate in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, was the

only metabolite with significantly reduced levels upon
riluzole treatment suggesting riluzole may inhibit de novo
pyrimidine synthesis.

DISCUSSION
Incorporation of riluzole into breast cancer treatment
paradigms has been hampered by a limited understanding
of its mechanism of action. In this study, a pharmacologic
approach was undertaken to investigate the antitumor
effects of riluzole in a panel of human breast cancer cell
lines and compared to the effects of the known glutamate
receptor antagonist BAY 36-7620. Treatment with either
drug produced cell line-dependent effects on markers for
proliferation, cell cycle, and DNA damage. Both drugs
inhibited cell growth and cell number while altering
expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and
oncogenic pathways. While riluzole and BAY 36-7620
both induce cell death, they have differential effects within
cell cycle. Whereas riluzole induced cell death with mitotic
arrest, BAY 36-7620 caused cell death without substantial

changes in the cell including decreased oxidative
phosphorylation and alteration of cellular metabolite levels
suggesting a novel role for riluzole in cell metabolism.
Some cell lines showed differential sensitivity to either
riluzole or BAY 36-7620. These data support distinct druginduced mechanisms of cell cycle inhibition leading to cell
death.
Riluzole-induced DNA damage in breast cancer cell
lines was variable and cell line-specific, an observation
consistent with that in melanoma cells [24]. However,
BAY 36-7620 had a significantly more robust effect as
compared to riluzole. Genomic variability between breast
cancer cell lines may influence susceptibility to riluzole.
One such area of speculation includes TP53 mutational
status or HER2 status that place cells under replicative
stress. Riluzole did not induce DNA damage in MCF7 cells (TP53 wildtype) whereas moderate induction of
DNA damage occurred in the majority of TP53 mutant cell

lines. In contrast, BAY 36-7620 had a more universal DNA
damaging effect on all cell lines tested, again suggesting a
distinct mechanism from riluzole. Interestingly, riluzoleinduced mitotic arrest was more prominent in TP53mutated cell lines as compared to TP53 wildtype MCF-7
cells suggesting that loss of p53 checkpoint activity may
lead to mitotic catastrophe in TP53 mutant cells. Given
the paucity of TP53 wildtype breast cancer cell lines, this
relationship is difficult to confirm. Further exploration
of the role of p53 may enlighten any potential role in
response to riluzole. In addition to TP53 mutations,
alterations in other genes involved in the DNA damage
response or other pathways may also sensitize cells to
riluzole-induced DNA damage. For example, BT-474
cells have alterations in BRCA2, ATM, and PARP1 that
may predispose these cells to increased DNA damage by
riluzole. Also, BT-474 cells are Her2 overexpressing and
have a higher mitotic rate which may induce replicative
stress upon treatment with riluzole. Further exploration

of drug response in genetically engineered cell lines may
help to better delineate these relationships.
While others have found correlations between
riluzole-induced DNA damage and GRM1 expression
in melanoma cell lines [24], there was no apparent
correlation between GRM1 level and drug response to
riluzole in these breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, riluzole
was still effective in cell lines with the lowest GRM1
expression suggesting that riluzole may affect non-GRM1
targets. Similarly, Speyer et al. [25] found that genetically
altering GRM1 expression in breast cancer cells did not
affect response to riluzole. These data and that by others
are consistent with the hypothesis that riluzole may have
effects that are independent of direct signaling through
GRM1. Neither data eliminate a possible role for other
glutamate receptors as mediators of riluzole response in
these cell lines and would require further study.
Others have shown that riluzole alters redox
homeostasis as a mechanism for DNA damage and cell
death in melanoma cells in vitro [24]. Increased ROS and
reduced GSH were observed in a subset of riluzole-treated
breast cancer cell lines suggesting alteration of the redox
state of some cell lines. However, the antioxidant NAC
was unable to inhibit riluzole-induced cell cycle arrest
suggesting that either these two events are not coupled or
that DNA damage occurs as a later event. While riluzole
induced oxidative stress, this seemed to be independent of
its effect on cell cycle in breast cancer cells.
Riluzole has been shown to indirectly inhibit GRM1
activity in melanoma [13]. The data presented here suggest
that there are distinct drug-specific effects between riluzole
and BAY 36-7620 in breast cancer cells. Further, these
data are consistent with effects that may be independent
of direct signaling through GRM1. These effects include
altered oxidative metabolism and levels of cellular
metabolites. Riluzole effect on other glutamate receptors
or pathways regulated by glutamate cannot be ruled out.
However, ammonia levels, which can be produced by
glutamate metabolism, were unchanged by riluzole (data
not shown) suggesting that it does not induce ammonia
toxicity as its mechanism of action. As other pathways are
glutamate-dependent, including but not limited to amino
acid biosynthesis and lipid synthesis, additional research
into the effects of riluzole on these pathways is warranted.
Riluzole also altered precursors or derivatives of
nucleotides that compose DNA. As such, altered DNA
biosynthesis pathways remain a possible target. It has
been shown that incorporation of precursor nucleotides in
DNA leads to stalled replication forks and ultimately cell
cycle arrest and death [26]. Alternatively, an increase in
nucleotide catabolism may not be a direct effect of riluzole
treatment, but a consequence of mitotic arrest. Riluzoleinduced mitotic arrest shifts the cell population towards
an increase in the fraction of cells in G2/M. Cells in G2/M
may increase the catabolism of nucleotides that are not
further needed for DNA synthesis. The observed increase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in nucleotide/nucleoside levels may reflect cell cyclespecific differences.
Riluzole has been studied in Phase II clinical
trials for the treatment of patients with stage III and IV
melanoma with 42% of patients exhibiting stable disease
[27]. As an FDA-approved drug for other indications,
riluzole could be quickly moved into trials for the
treatment of breast cancer based on its antitumor effects
in preclinical models. Understanding the mechanistic
effects provides a rationale to explore the use of riluzole
alone or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies.
Breast cancer subtypes with high replicative stress (e.g.
TP53 mutation, MYC amplification, high mitotic index)
or those with DNA repair defects (e.g. triple negative
breast cancers, BRCA-related breast cancers) may
represent markers for more suitable patient selection for
riluzole-based regimens. However, this would require
additional biomarker evaluation to determine association
with riluzole sensitivity. Based on this study and others,
further development of riluzole and direct glutamate
signaling modulators for preclinical and clinical studies
is warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
MCF-7, T-47D, BT-474, MDA-MB-231, Hs578T,
and BT-549 breast cancer cell lines (Charles River
Laboratories, Inc, New York, NY; ATCC, Manassas, VA)
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) plus 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All cell lines were
authenticated by the Gene Expression and Genotyping
Core Facility at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary
Center for Biotechnology Research using the established
STR profiling system.

Reagents and antibodies
Riluzole hydrochloride (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol,
UK) and BAY 36-7620 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK)
were dissolved in DMSO. GRM1 primary antibody is
specific to the C-terminal region of human GRM1α and
was used at a dilution of 1:2000 for Western blotting
(catalog number 36350002; Novus Biologicals, Littleton,
CO). Additional primary antibodies for Western blotting
or immunofluorescence include monoclonal anti-ß-actin
clone AC-15 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); phosphocdc2 (Tyr15), cyclin B1, phospho-histone H2AX (Ser139)
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Primary antibodies for
flow cytometry include phospho-histone H3 (Ser10)
rabbit monoclonal (Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate), histone
H3 rabbit monoclonal (Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugate),

rabbit monoclonal IgG isotype control (Alexa Fluor® 488
conjugate), rabbit monoclonal IgG isotype control (Alexa
Fluor® 647 conjugate) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA).

MCF-7 cells were treated with 50 μM riluzole or
BAY 36-7620 for 48h. BT-474 and BT-549 cells were
treated for 24h due to rapid entry of cells into subG1.
Total RNA was purified with RNeasy mini kit following
manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Germantown, MD).
RNA was subjected to DNase treatment to remove
contaminating DNA. The Human Genome U133A 2.0
Array was used to measure gene expression changes
from drug treatment compared to DMSO control. Three
independent replicates were used for each condition.
For analysis, raw CEL files were processed using the
justRMA function in R Bioconductor, obtaining log2
expression values. Gene expression signatures were
analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis [28],
obtaining a quantification of the statistical significance
for upregulation (P+) or downregulation (P-) for each
signature and sample pair. A sample was said to have a
signature significantly upregulated if P+ < 0.05 (red),
significantly downregulated if P- < 0.05 (blue), and no
significant change otherwise (black). For microarray
validation, RNA from cells treated with DMSO, 50 μM
riluzole, or 50 μM BAY 36-7620 was reverse transcribed
using the Taqman Reverse Transcription kit following
manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Pre-designed Taqman assays for genes
validated were used to perform quantitative PCR on the
complementary DNA. The RPLP0 gene was used as a
housekeeping gene control. Results are shown as relative
fold change of gene expression compared to DMSO
control treatment using the delta delta Ct method.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 and 3
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and centrifugation at
12,000 X g for 15 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford protein assay reagent (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Lysates were separated by 4-20%
gradient sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions.
Protein was transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride
(PVDF) membrane. Membranes were incubated overnight
at 4°C with primary antibody followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. Enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent was added to the
membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce
Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL). Chemiluminescence
was detected on the ChemiDoc™ Imaging System, and
densitometry was performed using the Image Lab software
(Bio-rad, Hercules, CA)

Drug sensitivity assay
Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and allowed to
attach overnight. Cells were then treated with increasing
concentrations of drug. After 72h of drug treatment,
MTS reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added and
cells were incubated at 37°C for 2-4 h. Absorbance was
measured at 490 nm using a Wallac 1420 Victor3 plate
reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Viability was
expressed as a percentage of control by dividing the
absorbance of each treated sample by the average of the
untreated controls.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells grown overnight were then treated with drug
for 48 and 72 h. All cells were collected by trypsinization
and cell number was determined using the Vi-CELL Cell
Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN).
Single cell suspensions with equal cell number were
prepared. Cells were fixed with absolute ethanol and
incubated overnight at -20°C then stained with 10 μg/ml
propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cell
cycle distribution was assessed by flow cytometry and
analyzed using CXP software (Cytomics FC 500 Series;
Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN).

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 6 well plates and allowed to
attach overnight. Cells were then treated with drug for
72 h. EdU was added at a final concentration of 10 μM
at 48 h drug treatment. Cell number was determined
using the Vi-CELL Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman
Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Equal cell numbers were fixed,
permeabilized, and stained according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Click-iT® EdU Alexa Fluor® 488 Flow
Cytometry Assay Kit; Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY). Percentage of proliferating cells was assessed by
flow cytometry at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.
Cells without EdU labeling were used as a negative
control for proper gating conditions. Data were analyzed
using CXP software (Cytomics FC 500 Series; Beckman
Coulter, Indianapolis, IN).

Histone H3 phosphorylation
Cells were grown overnight and then treated with
drug for 48 and 72 h. Cell number was determined using
the Vi-CELL Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter,
Indianapolis, IN). Paraformaldehyde was added to suspended
cells to a final concentration of 4% for 10 min at 37°C. Cells

for 30 min, and then washed twice with incubation buffer
(5 mg/ml of BSA in PBS). Cells were co-stained for 1 h
with phospho-histone H3 (Alexa Fluor® 488) and histone H3
(Alexa Fluor® 647) antibodies, evaluated by flow cytometry,
and analyzed using CXP software. Unstained and single
stained controls were used to gate the cells.

growth media overnight in XF24 plates then replaced with
DMEM without sodium bicarbonate or FBS and incubated
for 1 h. OCR measurements were taken at time 0, then
every 15 min after injection of DMSO or 50 μM riluzole.

γ-H2AX immunofluorescence

BT-474 cells were treated with DMSO or 50 μM
riluzole for 24 h. Water-soluble metabolites were extracted
and analyzed by LC/MS as previously described [29].
Metabolite measurements were normalized to cell number.

Cellular metabolite analysis by LC/MS

Cells were grown in chamber slides and then treated
with drug for 24 h. Paraformaldehyde was added to cells
to a final concentration of 4%. Cells were permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Primary antibody
to γ-H2AX was added to cells in 5% goat serum in PBS
(blocking buffer) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated secondary
antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h. Cells were mounted
with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) nuclear stain
and visualized using the Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescent
microscope. Cells positive for γ-H2AX foci were counted
from four independent fields.

Statistical analysis
All graphical data are represented as mean +/- standard
deviation (SD). For riluzole or BAY 36-7620 treatments,
unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to calculate
the P value of the difference between control (DMSO) and
treated cells from three independent experiments where
a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. For comparison of riluzole and BAY 36-7620,
one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's
multiple comparison test was used to calculate statistical
significance between groups. For comparison of cellular
metabolite levels between control and riluzole, t-test with
Bonferroni correction was used where a P value of less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection
Single cell suspensions of 24 h drug-treated
cells were incubated with CELLROX green reagent
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 45 min at
37°C. Oxidation-induced fluorescence was detected
by flow cytometry as a measure of ROS and corrected
for background autofluorescence. For ROS protection
experiments, cells were pretreated with 5 mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h
followed by treatment with drug.
