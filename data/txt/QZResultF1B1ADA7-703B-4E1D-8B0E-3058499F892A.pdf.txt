Abstract
Commonly used antitumor agents, such as DNA topoisomerase I/II poisons, kill cancer cells by creating nonrepairable
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). To repair DSBs, error-free
homologous recombination (HR), and/or error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) are activated. These processes
involve the phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase–related kinase
family of serine/threonine enzymes: ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-related for HR, and DNAdependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) for
NHEJ. Alterations in these repair processes can cause drug/
radiation resistance and increased genomic instability. BLapachone (B-lap; also known as ARQ 501), currently in
phase II clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer,
causes a novel caspase- and p53-independent cell death in
cancer cells overexpressing NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). NQO1 catalyzes a futile oxidoreduction of
B-lap leading to reactive oxygen species generation, DNA
breaks, ;-H2AX foci formation, and hyperactivation of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, which is required for cell
death. Here, we report that B-lap exposure results in NQO1dependent activation of the MRE11-Rad50-Nbs-1 complex. In
addition, ATM serine 1981, DNA-PKcs threonine 2609, and
Chk1 serine 345 phosphorylation were noted; indicative of
simultaneous HR and NHEJ activation. However, inhibition
of NHEJ, but not HR, by genetic or chemical means
potentiated B-lap lethality. These studies give insight into
the mechanism by which B-lap radiosensitizes cancer cells
and suggest that NHEJ is a potent target for enhancing the
therapeutic efficacy of B-lap alone or in combination with
other agents in cancer cells that express elevated NQO1
levels. [Cancer Res 2007;67(14):6936–45]

Introduction
Many cancer chemotherapeutic agents, such as ionizing
radiation (IR), and DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic compounds
cause cell death by creating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs; refs.
1, 2). DSBs can occur from endogenously produced reactive oxygen
species (ROS) or conversion of single-strand breaks (SSBs) to DSBs
by advancing replication forks (3). Although cells maintain the

capability to survive low levels of DNA damage, as little as one
nonrepaired DSB can be lethal (4).
Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end
joining (NHEJ) are two distinct, yet complementary, mechanisms
for mammalian DSB repair that can interact simultaneously at DSB
sites (5–7). Essential to both HR and NHEJ is the activation of one or
all three related phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase–like kinases (PI3K) in
response to DNA damage (7). Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) are associated with HR and are
typically activated during S-G2 phase by DNA breaks (e.g., ATM) or
after replication fork arrest (e.g., ATR activation). In contrast, DNAprotein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs; part of the DNA-PK
complex including the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer) is involved in NHEJ
that operates throughout the cell cycle in response to DSBs. These
kinases operate as transducer proteins, relaying and amplifying
damage signals to mediator proteins. A common substrate of all
PI3Ks is the histone variant, H2AX. Formation of phosphorylated
H2AX (g-H2AX) is a sensitive and early marker of DSBs (8, 9). Shortly
after DSB detection and PI3K activation, H2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine 139 (g-H2AX) in a 2-Mb region surrounding the
break. Microscopically, this phosphorylation event occurs on a
multitude of H2AX molecules leading to foci that are visible when
labeled with an antibody specific for g-H2AX. g-H2AX foci facilitate
the recruitment of DNA damage–regulating protein complexes to
the sites of damage (10), whereas g-H2AX dephosphorylation assists
repair (11). The MRE11/Rad50/Nbs-1 (MRN) complex serves as the
initial protein complex to participate in both NHEJ and HR repair
pathways (12). In NHEJ, the MRN complex modifies DSB ends by its
endonuclease and exonuclease activity (13). In HR, the complex acts
as an exonuclease to produce 3¶ single-strand overhangs bound by
Rad52 (12).
h-Lapachone (h-lap; also known as ARQ 501) is currently in phase
II clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in
combination with gemcitabine.4 h-Lap is a novel antitumor agent
that is bioactivated by the two-electron oxidoreductase, NAD(P)H
quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1; EC 1.6.99.2). Because NQO1
is highly expressed in many human cancers (e.g., pancreatic, breast,
lung, and prostate cancers), it is an attractive target for selective
cancer chemotherapy by h-lap alone or with IR (14–16).
h-Lap–induced cell death is triggered by the NQO1-dependent
oxidoreduction of h-lap (14), resulting in a futile cycling wherein
h-lap is reduced to an unstable hydroquinone that spontaneously
reverts to its parent structure using two oxygen molecules (17).
As a result, ROS are generated causing DNA damage, g-H2AX foci
formation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) hyperactivation, and subsequent loss of ATP and NAD+ (18). h-Lap–induced cell

death was unique in that PARP-1 and p53 proteolysis occurred
concomitant with A-calpain activation (17). h-Lap–mediated cell
death exhibited classic features of apoptosis (e.g., DNA condensation
and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end
labeling–positive cells), but was not dependent on typical apoptotic
mediators, such as p53, Bax/Bak, or caspases (19).
To date, few studies explored the contribution of DSB repair in
h-lap–induced cell death. We showed that h-lap caused DNA
damage, g-H2AX focus formation and PARP-1 hyperactivation
selectively in NQO1-expressing (NQO1+) cells (18). We therefore
investigated whether h-lap exposure of NQO1+ cancer cells activated HR and/or NHEJ, and explored the extent to which these
repair systems influenced cellular sensitivity. Various model cell
systems with altered ATM, ATR, or DNA-PKcs functions, as well
as use of selective kinase inhibitors were used. h-Lap caused a
delayed (10–15 min) dose-dependent activation of the MRN
complex, as well as ATM, DNA-PKcs, and ATR compared with
IR. Importantly, only inhibition of DNA-PKcs enhanced h-lap
potency, indicating a predominant role for NHEJ in DSB repair,
and resistance of cancer cells to this agent. These results suggest
the combinatorial use of NHEJ inhibitors to enhance h-lap
cytotoxicity for the treatment of human cancers that express
elevated NQO1 levels.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. h-Lap was synthesized by Dr. William G. Bornmann (M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), dissolved in DMSO at 40 mmol/L,
and the concentration was verified by spectrophotometry (18). Hoechst
33258, etoposide, and dicoumarol were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO). The DNA-PKcs inhibitor, Nu7026 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)-benzo[h]chroomen-4-one), and ATM/ATR kinase inhibitor (AAI) were obtained from
Calbiochem. They were dissolved in DMSO and used at 10 Amol/L unless
otherwise stated. 2-Morpholin-4-yl-6-thianthren-1-yl-pyran-4-one (KU55933) was synthesized by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals Ltd., dissolved in
DMSO, and used at 10 Amol/L.
Cell culture. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were maintained and used as
described (14). Human MO59K and MO59J cells, proficient and deficient in
both DNA-PK activity and p350 protein, respectively (20), were obtained
from Dr. Joan Turner (University of Alberta). U2OS-derived stable cell lines
that conditionally regulate wild-type (WT) or kinase-dead ATR (KD-ATR)
levels by doxycycline were generously provided by Drs. Paul Nghiem and
Stuart L. Schreiber (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; ref. 21).
Recombinant ATM was stably expressed in immortalized human A-T cells
using an episomal expression vector (22) and designated: A-T cells
(ATM / ) and A-T cells ectopically expressing ATM (ATM+/+). MO59K,
MO59J, ATM / , and ATM+/+ cells were stably infected using a puromycinselectable pLPCX retroviral vector alone or one containing the NQO1 cDNA
packaged in Phoenix-Ampho cells (23). Uninfected cells were removed by
puromycin selection (0.5 Ag/mL). However, all experiments were done
without selection. NQO1 expression was evaluated in all cells as described
(14). All cells were grown in high glucose-containing DMEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) or tetracycline-free FBS (U2OS cells), 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL)
at 37jC in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified atmosphere (24). All tissue
culture components were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were free of
Mycoplasma contamination.
Relative survival assays. Relative survival assays were done as described
(14). MCF-7, MO59K, and MO59J cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 Amol/L
Nu7026 or KU-55933 before cotreatment with h-lap at the indicated doses for
2 to 4 h. After h-lap treatment, medium containing Nu7026 or KU-55933
alone was added and then removed after 16 h. Drug-free medium was added
and survival was assessed after 6 days. U2OS WT or KD-ATR cells were
treated with 1 Ag/mL doxycycline 48 h before treatment with various h-lap

www.aacrjournals.org

doses, with or without dicoumarol (40 Amol/L) for 2 to 4 h, then replaced
with drug-free medium. Prior studies using h-lap showed that relative
survival assays correlated directly with colony-forming ability (14). Data were
expressed as means FSE for treated versus control from separate triplicate
experiments, and comparisons were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s
t test for paired samples.
Cell irradiation. For UV light C (UVC) exposures, U2OS WT and KDATR culture medium were removed, and then placed uncovered under a UV
lamp emitting primarily 254 nm radiation ( fluency rate of 2.2 J/m2/s). After
exposure, medium was replaced and cultures incubated for various times.
Other cells were treated with 10 Amol/L h-lap or 500 Amol/L H2O2 and
harvested for immunoblotting 2 h after treatment. For IR, cells were
irradiated using a 137Cs source as described and analyzed for foci formation
(see below; ref. 25).
Immunoblotting. Western blots were prepared as described (19) with
modifications. To examine Chk1, whole-cell extracts were prepared using
lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% NP40, 10 AL/mL protease inhibitor mixture, and
1 mmol/L sodium metavanadate]. Total a-Chk-1 and the a-phospho-Ser345
Chk-1 (Chk1-pSer345) antibody were used at a dilution of 1:100 (Cell
Signaling Technology) and a-tubulin was used at a dilution of 1:5,000
(Calbiochem). An NQO1 antibody was generously provided to us by Dr.
David Ross (University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO) and
used at a 1:2,000 dilution (26).
Confocal microscopy. MCF-7 cells were treated with 1 to 5 Amol/L
h-lap for various times with or without pretreatment and cotreatment with
Nu7026, KU-55933, or DMSO. As a positive control for DSB damage
responses, cells were irradiated with 5 Gy and fixed 15 min later. After
treatment, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) and incubated with
primary antibodies: a-MRE11, a-Rad50 (GeneTex), a-Nbs-1 phospho-Ser343
(Nbs-1-p; Abcam), a-ATM phospho-Ser1981, a-DNA-PKcs phospho-Thr2609
(Rockland), or a-g-H2AX (Trevigen; Upstate) overnight at 4jC at 1:100 to
500 dilutions. Alexa Fluor fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular
Probes) were added for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were visualized by
Hoechst 33258 staining at 1:3,000 dilution. Confocal images were collected
using a 63 numerical aperture 1.4 oil immersion planapochromat
objective at 488 and 594 nm from argon/HeNe1 lasers, respectively, using
a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. All Hoescht 33258-stained nuclear
images were collected using a Coherent Mira-F-V5-XW-220 Ti-Sapphire laser
tuned at 750 nm. Images shown were representative of experiments done
at least thrice. The average number of foci/A slice was calculated as means
FSE by counting z30 cells from three independent experiments. Student’s
t tests were used for comparison.
Alkaline and neutral comet assays. Single-cell gel electrophoretic
comet assays were done under alkaline or neutral conditions (18). MCF-7
cells were treated with 5 Amol/L h-lap, 100 Amol/L etoposide,
500 Amol/L H2O2, or vehicle alone and harvested at various times. For
neutral comet assays, after cellular lysis, slides were immersed in neutral
buffer [1  Tris-borate EDTA (pH 7.0)] for 60 min at room temperature in
the dark. Each data point represents the average of 100 cells FSE, and data
are representative of experiments done in duplicate.

Results
MRN complex activation by B-lap. Previously, we showed that
exposure of NQO1-expressing cancer cells to h-lap caused ROS
and DNA damage, measured by alkaline comet assays and
g-H2AX formation (18). Furthermore, activation of the MRN
complex following h-lap exposure was recently reported in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27). We wanted to determine if, and
which, DSB repair pathways were activated in response to h-lap
by examining MRN complex recruitment. Although the true
nature of damage-induced foci has not been elucidated, these
protein complexes are suggested to be a visual indication of DNA
repair centers (10). Because the MRN complex is central to both

HR and NHEJ, we examined foci formation in MCF-7 cells after
various times of h-lap exposure. Mock- or h-lap–treated cells
were stained with antibodies complementary to MRE-11, Rad50,
and phosphorylated Ser343 Nbs-1 (Nbs-1-p). Increases in the
organized localization of MRE-11 and Rad50 were observed in the
nuclei of h-lap–treated cells at 15 min and foci persisted >60 min
(Fig. 1A and B). Similarly, Nbs-1-p nuclear foci were visible
beginning 15 min after drug exposure, with similar kinetics as
g-H2AX (Fig. 1A and B); both proteins are downstream targets of
ATM activation (28). MRN complex foci were not visible prior to
15 min h-lap exposure (data not shown). Foci formation
was delayed compared with foci observed after IR exposure, in
which prior studies have shown g-H2AX foci formation within
1 to 5 min post-IR (29). Interestingly, with IR-treated cells MRN
foci randomly appeared throughout the nucleus, whereas with
h-lap–treated cells all components of the MRN formed foci that
were predominantly perinuclear (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A–
C). The appearance of perinuclear MRN foci is consistent with the
fact that NQO1 is largely cytoplasmic (30) and where ROS would
diffuse into the nucleus, leading to SSBs. SSBs may then be
converted to DSBs at a later time, thereby explaining the delayed
activation of the MRN complex.

Dose-dependent activation of ATM and DNA-PK after B-lap
treatment. Because the MRN complex was recruited after exposure
to h-lap, we examined cells for activation of ATM, a HR-associated
PI3K. After interacting with a DSB, ATM undergoes autophosphorylation at serine 1981, causing dissociation of the ATM homodimer
(31). Activated ATM monomers phosphorylate numerous downstream proteins, including Nbs-1 (28). To test for ATM activation,
MCF-7 cells were mock-treated or exposed to various h-lap doses.
Fixed cells were stained with a serine 1981 phosphospecific antibody
to ATM (ATM-pSer1981). ATM activation occurred in a dosedependent manner after h-lap treatment. h-Lap doses (0–3 Amol/L)
resulted in few activated ATM molecules, consistent with low levels
of DNA damage detected at these doses (Supplementary Fig. S2A;
Fig. 2A). In contrast, lethal doses of h-lap (z4 Amol/L) caused
considerable ATM activation with an f8-fold increase in the number
of foci per cell, corresponding to the net increase in total damage
(Supplementary Fig. S2A; Fig. 2A and C). These data suggest that the
accumulation of large numbers of h-lap–induced SSBs lead to DSBs
that, in turn, activate the canonical HR DSB repair pathway involving
MRN and ATM.
Due to the cell cycle independence of NQO1-mediated
bioactivation of h-lap (24) and generation of DNA damage, we

examined DNA-PK activation, as it functions in a cell cycle–
independent manner (19). Prior work indicated that DNA-PKcs was
autophosphorylated at Thr2609 (DNA-PKcs-pThr2609) in vivo in
response to IR, and DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 colocalizes with g-H2AX
after damage (32, 33). MCF-7 cells were mock-treated or exposed to
1 to 5 Amol/L h-lap for 30 min. Similar to ATM activation, DNAPKcs-pThr2609 foci formed in a dose-dependent manner. Nontoxic
h-lap doses caused few (z2 foci/cell) DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 foci
over background, whereas lethal doses led to increases in DNA-

which time samples were fixed and probed with antibodies to phosphorylated
ATM at Ser1981 (ATM-pSer1981 ; A) or phosphorylated DNA-PKcs at Thr2609
(DNA-Pkcs-pThr2609 ; B) and visualized by confocal microscopy. C, MCF-7
cells were treated with 0 to 5 Amol/L h-lap for 30 min; fixed; and probed for

PKcs-pThr2609 foci that colocalized with g-H2AX (ref. 32; Fig. 2B;
Supplementary Fig. S2B). Importantly, at 3 Amol/L h-lap (fLD50
for MCF-7 cells), DNA-PKcs was significantly activated (9 F 0.2 foci
per cell) whereas ATM and g-H2AX were not as robustly activated
(3.9 foci per cell F1.98 and 3.0 foci per cell F0.12, respectively).
These data suggest that both HR and NHEJ are activated after h-lap
exposure, but the predominant DNA repair pathway activated is
NHEJ (Fig. 2C).
NHEJ is necessary for B-lap–induced cell death. Due to the
robust DNA-PK activation after h-lap exposure, we examined the
consequences of its inhibition on lethality. Glioblastoma cell lines,
MO59K, containing DNA-PKcs and MO59J cells lacking DNA-PKcs,
were used (34). These cells lacked NQO1 and were resistant to
h-lap. After isolating NQO1-expressing pooled variants, MO59K
(MO59K-NQ+) and MO59J (MO59J-NQ+) cells had NQO1 enzymatic
activities of 790 F 20 and 690 F 10 Amol/cytochrome c reduced/Ag
protein, respectively. MO59J-NQ+ and MO59K-NQ+ were mock treated
or exposed to various h-lap doses for 2 h, with or without dicoumarol
cotreatment (a selective NQO1 inhibitor). DNA-PKcs–deficient
MO59J-NQ+ cells were significantly more sensitive to h-lap than their
DNA-PKcs–proficient counterparts, MO59K-NQ+ cells (Fig. 3A).
MO59J-NQ+ cells required doses of f5 Amol/L h-lap to elicit cell
death, whereas MO59K-NQ+ cells were resistant, with only 30%
cytotoxicity by 12 Amol/L h-lap. In both cell lines, cytotoxicity was
abrogated by inhibiting NQO1 activity with 40 Amol/L dicoumarol
(Fig. 3A). To assess DNA-PKcs functionality, we pretreated both
MO59J-NQ+ and MO59K-NQ+ cells with a DNA-PKcs selective
inhibitor Nu7026 before h-lap exposure. Nu7026 is a potent radiosensitizer in both proliferating and quiescent cells (35). As anticipated, Nu7026 had little effect on h-lap–induced cell death in MO59JNQ+ cells because they are devoid of DNA-PKcs activity. In contrast, Nu7026 significantly sensitized MO59K-NQ+ cells to h-lap
(Fig. 3B). Treatment with Nu7026 and 12 Amol/L h-lap resulted in
an f80 F 3% reduction in survival versus f5 F 1% loss of survival
in MO59K-NQ+ cells that were pretreated with vehicle (Fig. 3B).
To confirm that DNA-PK was essential in resistance to h-lap–
induced cell death, MCF-7 cells were treated with sublethal doses
of h-lap with or without pretreatment and cotreatment with
30 Amol/L Nu7026 for 2 h and relative survival was determined.
h-Lap doses V2 Amol/L had little to no cytotoxicity alone,
whereas h-lap doses 2.5 Amol/L and higher caused significant
lethality. When MCF-7 cells were treated with Nu7026 and h-lap,
lethality was potentiated (Fig. 3C). Significant differences in cell
death were noted at 2 to 2.5 Amol/L h-lap, where cotreatment
with otherwise nontoxic doses of Nu7026 and h-lap resulted in a
>80% reduction in survival compared with cells treated with h-lap
alone (Fig. 3C). To confirm that DNA-PKcs and not ATM was
important in h-lap–induced cell death, MCF-7 cells were treated
with 5 Amol/L h-lap alone with or without pretreatment and
cotreatment with 30 Amol/L Nu7026. Effects on DNA-PKcs versus
ATM foci formation were then assessed. After 30 min of h-lap
exposure, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies to
both DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 and ATM-pSer1981 and the average
number of foci per cell were examined by confocal microscopy.
h-Lap–treated MCF-7 cells resulted in 14 F 0.1 DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 foci per cell, which was reduced to 3 F 1 foci per cell
after Nu7026 coadministration (Fig. 3D). ATM-pSer1981 foci were
not altered after Nu7026 and h-lap treatment versus h-lap alone
(5 F 3 versus 5 F 0.7, respectively), indicating that DNA-PKcs
was the predominate PI3K inhibited after treatment with Nu7026
(Fig. 3D).

Figure 3. Loss of DNA-PKcs activity potentiates h-lap–induced cell death. A to C, cell death was examined using relative survival assays in NQO1-containing cells.
A, MO59K-NQ+ (DNA-PKcs positive) and MO59J-NQ+ (DNA-PKcs negative) cells were treated with varying doses of h-lap alone or in combination with 40 Amol/L
dicoumarol (DIC ) for 2 h. After drug exposure, media were removed and drug-free medium was added. Cells were then allowed to grow for an additional 6 d and relative
survival, based on DNA content, was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining as described in Materials and Methods. B, loss of DNA-PKcs kinase activity sensitizes
MO59K-NQ+ cells to h-lap. Relative survival assays using MO59K-NQ+ and MO59J-NQ+ pretreated and cotreated with the DNA-PKcs inhibitor Nu7026
(10 Amol/L) for 1 h before treatment with varying doses of h-lap for 2 h. C, inhibition of DNA-PKcs with Nu7026 potentiates h-lap–induced cell death in NQO1+
MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were treated with sublethal to lethal doses of h-lap alone with or without pretreatment and cotreatment with 30 Amol/L Nu7026 for 2 h.
Differences were compared using two-tailed Student’s t test. Groups having *P V 0.05 and **P V 0.001 values compared with h-lap alone are indicated. D,
Nu7026 inhibits DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 but not ATM-pSer1981. MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 Amol/L h-lap with or without pretreatment and cotreatment with 30 Amol/L
Nu7026 for 30 min. After treatment, cells were fixed and probed with antibodies to DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 and ATM-pSer1981 and foci were visualized by confocal
microscopy. Quantitation of the average number of foci per cell for at least 60 cells per treatment group. Columns, mean; bars, SE. Student’s t test for paired samples,

after h-lap treatment. Immunoblot analyses of PAR and a-tubulin protein levels from whole-cell extracts from MO59J-NQ+ and MO59K-NQ+ cells that were mock treated
or treated with 5 or 12 Amol/L h-lap and harvested after 30 min. Relative PAR levels were determined by densitometry analyses using a-tubulin loading controls by
NIH ImageJ wherein controls were set to 1.0. Columns, means; bars, SE. AU, arbitrary units.

We previously showed that h-lap–induced cell death was
mediated by PARP-1 hyperactivation (18). Because a deficiency
in DNA-PKcs potentiated h-lap–induced cell death, we examined
whether NHEJ inhibition was accompanied by PARP-1 hyperactivation at sublethal doses of h-lap. PARP-1 is associated with
both SSB and DSB repair. After binding to DNA breaks, PARP-1

converts h-NAD+ into polymers of branched or linear poly(ADPribose) (PAR) units and attaches them to various nuclear
proteins, including PARP-1 itself as part of its autoregulation
(36). MO59J-NQ+ and MO59K-NQ+ cells were treated with various
doses of h-lap and cell extracts prepared at 20 min posttreatment. Lethal doses of h-lap in MO59J-NQ+ cells resulted in

considerable PAR accumulation, whereas the same dose that was
nontoxic to MO59K-NQ+ cells resulted in little PAR accumulation
(Fig. 3E). Increasing levels of PAR polymers were noted in the
MO59K-NQ+ cells with increasing (z5 Amol/L) h-lap doses
(Fig. 3E). Treatment of h-lap-exposed MCF-7 cells with Nu7026,
but not with the ATM and ATR inhibitors (KU55933 and AAI),
resulted in PAR formation (data not shown).
HR-associated PI3K ATM is not necessary for B-lap–induced
cell death. Because ATM autophosphorylation was observed after
h-lap treatment in NQO1-proficient cancer cells, we investigated
whether loss of ATM would alter h-lap–mediated lethality. Isogenic
NQO1+ human immortalized fibroblasts from A-T patients deficient
in ATM (ATM / ) or proficient via ectopic ATM expression
(ATM+/+) were used (22). ATM+/+ and ATM / cells were mock
treated or exposed to various h-lap doses with or without
dicoumarol for 4 h. There was no observable difference in h-lap–
induced lethality between NQO1-proficient ATM+/+ or ATM /
cells, and both cells were protected from lethality by dicoumarol
(Fig. 4A).
To corroborate these findings, MCF-7 cells were mock treated or
exposed to various doses of h-lap in the presence or absence of the
ATM kinase inhibitor, KU55933, or the general ATM/ATR inhibitor,
AAI, for 2 or 4 h (37). KU55933 inhibited ATM-pSer1981 after h-lap or
IR treatments, but did not inhibit NQO1 (Fig. 3D; data not shown).
Although weak ATM activation was observed after sublethal doses of
h-lap, inhibition of ATM by KU55933 or AAI had little effect on h-lap–
induced lethality of Figs. 2A and 4B–C.
ATR activation after B-lap exposure. HR can also be
mediated by ATR, which is recruited to ssDNA regions, arising

due to replication fork arrest or during the processing of bulky
lesions, such as UV photoproducts (38). We reasoned that h-lap
could generate ROS-induced SSBs, causing replication fork
stalling. Thus, we examined whether ATR activation occurred in
response to h-lap by using a set of stable cell lines derived from
U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma). These cells are wild-type for
p53, have an intact G1 DNA-damage checkpoint, and allow the
doxycycline-inducible expression of either wild-type ATR or a
dominant-negative (kinase-dead) ATR point mutant (21). ATR
activation was confirmed by monitoring Chk1-pSer345 levels in
WT U2OS cells after exposure to UVC or h-lap (Fig. 5A). Chk1pSer345 was muted in U2OS KD-ATR cells after either UVC or hlap exposures (Fig. 5A). Importantly, neither expression of WT
ATR or inhibition of ATR by KD-ATR affected the survival of
NQO1+ U2OS cells after h-lap exposure (Fig. 5B). Administration
of dicoumarol abrogated h-lap–induced lethality in both cell lines
(Fig. 5B).
To confirm our findings that HR was not necessary for h-lap–
induced cell death, we treated MCF-7 cells with AAI, an inhibitor of
both ATM and ATR, before h-lap exposure. Inhibition of both
enzymes was not sufficient to enhance h-lap–mediated cytotoxicity
compared with the 80% enhancement observed after inhibition of
DNA-PKcs (Figs. 3C and 4C). These data indicate that ATR
signaling is activated after h-lap exposure, but that it is not a
predominant factor required for survival.
h-Lap–induced ATR activation and PARP-1 hyperactivation
suggested that this compound caused extensive SSBs, whereas
MRN, ATM, and DNA-PK foci formation indicated delayed DSB
formation. Neutral and alkaline comet assays were done to

elucidate the type(s) of breaks created in NQO1-proficient human
cancer cells after h-lap exposure. Sublethal doses of h-lap
resulted in no detectable DNA strand breakage over time,
consistent with their survival (Supplementary Fig. S3; ref. 18).
In contrast, lethal doses of h-lap resulted in significant total DNA
breaks, occurring immediately after drug exposure at levels
surpassing breaks created after 500 Amol/L H2O2 (Fig. 5C). Prior
data showed that ROS formation and DNA damage were detected
within V5 min after h-lap addition (18). The amount of DNA
strand breaks increased over time after 5 Amol/L h-lap
treatment, suggesting that the lethal event may be related to
the total amount of DNA breaks generated.5 Interestingly, when
cells were analyzed using neutral conditions, little to no DSBs
were detected, in contrast to etoposide (ETO) treatment (Fig. 5C).
As expected, H2O2 treatment caused few DSBs, similar to damage
observed after h-lap exposure (Fig. 5C). The formation of DNA
breaks after h-lap treatment was NQO1-dependent because
dicoumarol prevented damage (18). These studies indicate that

the majority of DNA damage caused by the NQO1-mediated
metabolism of h-lap was SSBs, consistent with the genesis of
‘‘long-lived’’ ROS (e.g., H2O2).

Discussion
h-Lap, a natural product-based antitumor agent, elicits a unique
cell death pathway selectively in cancer cells that express elevated
NQO1 levels. The drug is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for
the treatment of pancreatic as well as other cancers.4 We recently
showed that h-lap–induced cell death was dependent on PARP-1
hyperactivation, but not on typical apoptotic mediators, such
as p53, Bax/Bak or caspases (17). Data from others suggested that
h-lap does not cause DNA damage (39). However, we recently
showed that h-lap–induced cell death was initiated by the NQO1dependent generation of ROS, subsequent formation of DNA
damage, and calcium-dependent PARP-1 hyperactivation. Once
stimulated, PARP-1 hyperactivation depletes ATP/NAD+ pools
inhibiting DNA repair. Therefore, once a threshold level of DNA
breaks are formed, PARP-1 hyperactivation appears to be the
dominant factor, dictating downstream events leading to cell death
(Fig. 6A; ref. 18). Because reaching the threshold level of DNA
breaks required to hyperactivate PARP-1 is critical for the lethality
of this drug, understanding the mechanism(s) by which cells resist

this threshold (e.g., amplified DNA repair) is important for
improving its efficacy.
To determine the repair pathways activated by h-lap, we
examined a number of proteins involved in DSB repair, due to
their very rapid and specific localization and modification at
DSBs (10). We noted delayed, h-lap–induced MRN complex
activation and DNA damage with respect to IR (Figs. 1A and B
and 5; Supplementary Fig. S1). Simultaneously, we noted the
activation of ATM and DNA-PK as monitored by their autophosphorylation products, which only occurred in NQO1-expressing
cells (Figs. 2A–C; Supplementary Fig. S4). Although low levels of
g-H2AX and DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 foci were evident in NQO1deficient cells, this may be due to the metabolism of this quinone by
one-electron oxidoreductases, such as NADPH cytochrome P-450
or b5R reductases (40). Overall, however, these data support a role
for NQO1 in amplifying the lethal effects of h-lap via its twoelectron oxidoreduction (Supplementary Fig. S4). Activation of
ATM, DNA-PK, and the MRN complex were dose-dependent
(Figs. 1 and 2). Evidence from our laboratory suggested that this
may be due to a minimal threshold of DNA damage created
after h-lap treatment, after which point the cell is committed to
death via PARP-1 hyperactivation.5
DNA-PKcs plays a direct role in DSB repair by acting as a key
component of NHEJ because defects in kinase activity result in
radiosensitivity (34). Because NHEJ is the primary mechanism by
which mammalian cells repair DSBs, we tested the hypothesis that
NHEJ was not only activated after h-lap treatment, but necessary
to protect cells from h-lap–induced lethality at sublethal doses. We
noted an f2-fold increase in the number of DNA-PKcs-pThr2609
versus ATM-pSer1981–induced foci after h-lap exposure (Fig. 2C).
Further examination of MO59K-NQ+ and MO59J-NQ+ cells revealed
that NHEJ was essential for survival of cells after h-lap treatment
(Fig. 3A). Importantly, cotreatment of cells with h-lap + Nu7026, a
DNA-PKcs inhibitor, sensitized MO59K-NQ+ cells as well as MCF-7
cells (Fig. 3B and C), indicating a major role for NHEJ in repair of
h-lap–induced DNA damage.
To determine if NHEJ inhibition enhanced PARP-1–mediated
cell death at otherwise sublethal h-lap doses, we examined PAR
accumulation in MO59J-NQ+ and MO59K-NQ+ cells. In DNAPKcs–deficient MO59J-NQ+ cells, doses of h-lap z5 Amol/L alone

caused significant PAR modification (Fig. 3E). However, the
proficiency of NHEJ in MO59K-NQ+ cells muted PAR accumulation, consistent with its role as a cellular resistance factor in
h-lap–induced lethality (Fig. 3E). Coadministration of Nu7026 in
MCF-7 cells converted sublethal h-lap doses into a cytotoxic
event accompanied by the accumulation of PAR polymers not
seen with ATM or ATR inhibitors (Figs. 3C and 4B and C; and
data not shown). These data indicate that interruption of NHEJ
during h-lap treatment commits cells to PARP-1–mediated cell
death (Fig. 6; ref. 18). A relationship between DNA-PK and PARP-1
has been established, and inhibition of both proteins increased
net DSB over time after chemically induced damage (41, 42).
Thus, combining h-lap and NHEJ inhibitors would be an ideal
‘‘two-hit’’ cancer therapy, by inhibiting mechanistically diverse
DNA repair enzymes and thereby retarding DSB rejoining.
In addition to DNA-PKcs-pThr2609, ATM-pSer1981 was also
noted after h-lap treatment (Fig. 2A). Although there is some
discrepancy as to the exact role ATM plays in HR, it does play a
pivotal role in general damage signaling, cell cycle regulation, and
the slow component of DSB repair (43–45). After IR, A-T cells
fail to show recovery from damage, and experiments using
reverse genetics failed to see potentiation in cell death arising
from the conditional loss of RAD54 in ATM / cells, suggesting
an inherent HR defect in ATM / cells (46). An interplay between
ATM and DNA-PKcs may be important for the proper initiation
of DSB signaling and processing of DSBs to ensure repair and
maintenance of genomic integrity after damage (47). Using cells
deficient in ATM, we tested whether the loss of ATM, and
therefore, HR-mediated repair, would alter h-lap–mediated cell
death similar to that observed with NHEJ loss. Data from our
studies revealed no significant difference between ATM+/+ and
ATM / cells in terms of h-lap sensitivity (Fig. 4A). Studies using
KU55933 corroborated these findings, as inhibition of ATM did
not augment lethality in h-lap–treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4B). The
dose of KU55933 used in these studies was sufficient to inhibit
ATM-pSer1981 after IR or h-lap–induced DNA damage (Fig. 3D).
Interestingly, inhibition of ATM-pSer1981 by this inhibitor also
abrogated DNA-PKcs-pThr2609, as recently noted by Chen et al.
(47), supporting a role for ATM in DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 in
response to DNA damage (Fig. 3D). In contrast, inhibition of

Figure 6. Model of h-lap–induced cell
death after lethal and sublethal doses.
A, h-lap–induced cell death at lethal doses
is PARP-1 dominated. h-Lap–mediated
metabolism by NQO1 generates ROS that
cause SSBs. Extensive SSBs cause
hyperactivation of PARP-1 and subsequent
NAD+ and ATP loss, which inhibits DNA
repair and causes cell death. B, nonlethal
doses of h-lap are converted to lethal
events via DNA-PK inhibition. At sublethal
doses of compound, repairable amounts of
SSBs are generated, some of which may
be converted to DSBs possibly via
replication fork arrest. This causes the
activation of members of the PI3K family of
kinases, ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs.
However, only NHEJ seems to be the
primary repair pathway needed to resolve
DSBs after drug treatment, as only
inhibition of DNA-PKcs by either chemical
(Nu7026) or genetic (DNA-PKcs / )
means potentiated the toxicity of sublethal
doses of h-lap leading to PARP-1–
mediated cell death.

DNA-PKcs with Nu7026 blocked ATM-mediated DNA-PKcspThr2609 (Fig. 3D). These data suggested that ATM-mediated
DNA-PKcs-pThr2609 was a component of an amplification
scheme, whereby autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Thr2609
was required before signal amplification via ATM.
ATR is recruited by ATR-interacting protein to replication
protein A–coated ssDNA that accumulates at stalled DNA
replication forks or is generated by processing initial DNA damage
(28). Thus, ATR activation in response to h-lap exposure may be
consistent with stalled replication forks and could indicate the
formation of DSBs from SSBs in response to h-lap exposure
(48, 49). The primary lesions generated after h-lap exposure were
SSBs (Fig. 5C). The lack of detectable DSBs could be the result of
the low sensitivity of neutral comet assays compared with gH2AX–induced foci formation to detect minor DSBs populations.
Importantly, formation of g H2AX, as well as activation of MRN,
ATM, DNA PK, and ATR appeared in a delayed manner with
respect to initial SSBs (<5 min versus 10–15 min, respectively;
ref. 18). These data support the hypothesis that DSBs are formed as
a secondary DNA lesion after initial SSBs were generated,
likely resulting from stalled replication forks (Fig. 6).
Nevertheless, ATR signaling does not seem to be a factor in h-lap
resistance. Using U2OS KD-ATR and WT-ATR, we showed an
increase in Chk1-pSer345 after UVC, as well as after h-lap treatment, that was muted in the presence of doxycycline, which
increased dominant-negative ATR expression (Fig. 5A). Total levels
of Chk1 and NQO1 were relatively unchanged under doxycycline
treatment (data not shown). U2OS KD-ATR cells treated with or
without doxycycline showed no enhanced h-lap toxicity (Fig. 5B).

Furthermore, addition of AAI had no apparent effect on h-lap–
induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, neither ATM
nor ATR seem to play major roles as resistance factors in h-lap
lethality.
Currently used cancer chemotherapeutic agents function
primarily as nonselective inducers of DSBs in highly proliferative
cells. A major problem with many of these agents is their lack of
selectivity, in which both normal and cancerous tissues are
targeted. In contrast, h-lap, which is currently under investigation
in phase I/II clinical trials, selectively targets cancer cells that
express elevated NQO1 levels, resulting in DNA damage and cell
death mediated by PARP-1 (18). Here, we show that in addition to
SSB-induced DNA repair pathways, h-lap activates various DSB
repair pathways. In particular, NHEJ was a key factor in the survival
of cells exposed to h-lap, because inhibition of NHEJ causes PARP1–mediated cell death after treatment or sublethal doses of
h-lap. In summary, these data warrant the combinatorial use of
h-lap with inhibitors of NHEJ thereby increasing the therapeutic
efficacy of this compound by targeting two distinct repair
mechanisms, NHEJ and PARP-1.
