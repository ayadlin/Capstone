ABSTRACT
Cancer cells up-regulate cell stress pathways, including the protein chaperone
Hsp90. Increases in Hsp90 are believed “buffer” mutant protein activities necessary
for cancer phenotypes. Activation of the cell stress pathway also alters the
transcriptional landscape of cells in ways that are critical for cancer progression.
However, it is unclear when and how the cell stress pathway is de-regulated during
cancer progression. Here we report that mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) found in colorectal cancer activate cell stress pathways in mouse intestinal crypt
cells, prior to loss of heterozygosity at APC or to the appearance of canonical intestinal
cancer markers. Hsp90 levels are elevated in normal APC heterozygote crypt cells and
further elevated in non-cancer cells adjacent to dysplasias, suggesting that the Hsp90
stress pathway marks the “cancer-field” effect. Expression of mutant APC in normal
human epithelial cells is sufficient to activate a cell stress pathway via perturbations
in microtubule dynamics. Inhibition of microtubule dynamics is sufficient to activate an
Hsf1-dependent increase in gene transcription and protein levels. We suggest that the
early activation of this Hsf1 dependent cell stress pathway by mono-allelic mutations
in APC can affect cell programming in a way that contributes to cancer onset.

associated co-chaperones also play a more general role in
coping with proteomic stress that arises from amplified
genes, increases in chromosome ploidy, or deregulation
of transcriptional regulators [9–12]. The need to maintain
multiple protein networks involved in signaling and cell
survival may further contribute to the proteomic stress
experienced by cancer cells. Thus, cancer cells may have
a large number of Hsp90 targets, an idea supported by the
complexity of the Hsp90-interactome [13–16], and by the
finding that a larger percentage of Hsp90 is in an active
conformation in cancer cells [17–19].
Although Hsp90 is the best studied downstream
target of the heat shock response, its levels and the
expression of a large number of stress respsonsive genes
are under control of the master transcriptional regulator,
HSF1. Recent work has revealed that HSF1, and by
extension its network of regulated genes, plays a critical
role in cancer onset and progression. This is strikingly
demonstrated in studies that have deleted HSF1 from mice
carrying cancer-promoting mutations [6, 20–23]. Loss of
HSF1 in p53-/- mice reduces the incidence of lymphomas

INTRODUCTION
The heat shock response is part of larger network
of pathways that responds to cell stress and that plays an
essential, conserved role in cellular adaptation following
perturbations to cell homeostasis. A variety of studies
indicate that cancer cells depend on a similar adaptive
response [1, 2]. Indeed, cells lacking HSF1, the master
transcriptional regulator of the heat shock pathway, are
refractory to transformation by variety of oncogenes
[1, 3]. These findings suggest a role for the heat shock
pathway in cancer initiation or progression. Although
the exact mechanisms by which the heat shock pathway
aids in oncogenic transformation remain unclear, one
possibility is that increases in heat shock proteins (HSPs),
such as Hsp90, contribute to the proteomic stability.
Hsp90 has been proposed to act as a “buffer” to maintain
the activity of mutated oncogenes. Support for this idea
comes from the ability of Hps90 to interact with and
stabilize a wide-range of oncogenic proteins (e.g., v-Src
and Raf) [2, 4–8]. Evidence suggests that Hsp90 and

and animals instead succumb to sarcomas and carcinomas
[1, 19]. In contrast, Ras activation induces HSF1 and
loss of HSF1 delays tumor formation [1, 3, 24–27]. The
distinct roles of HSF1 in specific cancers suggest that its
targets vary depending on the genetic context of the cell.
Support for this idea comes from the finding that HSF1
interacts with distinct sets of promoters in the context of
heat shock response as compared to the conditions in a
malignant cancer cell [4, 6, 28]. The implication is that
the heat shock pathway and HSF1 responds differentially
to evolving cellular conditions and that chronic activation
of this pathway may allow cells to adapt to a cancer state.
We will refer to the activation of this HSF1 dependent
transcriptional response as part of a larger cellular stress
response, or pathway.
The necessity of the HSF1 cell stress pathway in
carcinogenesis is clear. However, the upstream triggers
that activate it and when activation is required during
carcinogenesis are not well understood [9, 29]. One
hypothesis is that cell stress pathway activation is triggered
in response to a single, initiating mutation in a cancer
pathway. This possibility is consistent with cell stress
and cell senescence induced by oncogenic mutations and
the ability of HSF1 to repress senescence [13, 15, 16, 30,
31]. This hypothesis predicts that cancer driver mutations
will result in chronic activation of the HSF1 cell stress
pathway prior to cancer onset to allow cells to tolerate
additional genomic instability and thus contribute to cancer
progression. As a first test of these predictions, we focused
on driver mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) tumor suppressor that contribute to both familial
and sporadic human colorectal cancer [17, 19, 32].
APC mutants most frequently give rise to truncated
proteins that we have previously shown to dominantly
inhibit microtubule dynamics, resulting in chromosome
segregation errors [19, 20, 22, 28]. Mitotic errors were
also observed in the otherwise normal intestinal crypt
cells of APCMin/+ mice, arguing that microtubule dynamics
are perturbed due to a single mutant allele of APC [19,
33]. APCMin/+ mice develop adenomas (or dysplasias) in
the small intestine, which exhibit loss of heterozygosity
at APC and an elevation in β-catenin levels, consistent
with proposed progression of human colorectal tumors
[24–27, 34]. We tested the possibility that a monoallelic
mutation at APC is sufficient to activate the heat shock
pathway, possibly by inhibiting microtubule dynamics. We
found that Hsp90 levels are elevated both in abnormally
organized crypts (i.e, dysplasias) that have undergone
LOH as well as in histologically normal tissue adjacent
to the dysplasia. Remarkably, the majority of normal
intestinal crypt cells from APCMin/+ mice have elevated
Hsp90 compared to wild type intestinal cells. Significantly,
we found that in vitro expression of APC mutants, or
direct perturbations of microtubule dynamics, activate
a cell stress response, arguing for a direct link between
APC mutants, microtubule dynamics and the cell stress

program. The findings argue that a single cancer-associated
mutation can activate a cell stress pathway in a way mimics
the phenotype of mature cancer cells in otherwise normal
cells, thus anticipating the cancer cell state.

RESULTS
Hsp90 is elevated in APCMin/+ crypts prior to
cancer onset
To assess the temporal relationship between cell
stress pathway activation and cancer onset, we analyzed the
levels of Hsp90 in three regions in APCMin/+ mice that are
representative of discreet disease states: (i) dysplastic regions
are associated with early cancer and characterized by cell
expansion, disorganized columnar epithelium, increases in
β-catenin and loss of full length APC (Figure 1A–1B, arrow);
(ii) regions adjacent to dysplasias, usually within 1–20 cell
equivalents that appear otherwise normal (e.g., normal
levels of β-catenin; Figure 1A–1B, arrowhead); (iii) normal
intestinal crypts found approximately 10 crypt distances away
from any dysplasia. Consistent with expectations, dysplastic
regions exhibited elevated levels of β-catenin as compared
to normal adjacent tissue (Figure 1A) and the absence of full
length APC, as detected with a carboxy terminal antibody
that does not recognized the Min mutant protein [28, 35, 36]
(Figure 1B, see large arrowhead). In adjacent serial sections,
we found that Hsp90 levels are dramatically elevated
within dysplastic tissues (1.5-fold increase; Figure 1C), as
compared to histologically normal intestinal crypts from
the same animal. Unexpectedly, we found that Hsp90 levels
are equally elevated in a subset of normal cells adjacent to
dysplastic tissues (Figure 1C, see small arrowheads). These
were judged to be non-cancer cells based on the low levels
of β-catenin and normal apical localization of full length
APC (Figure 1D, see small arrowheads). Additionally,
histological analysis showed no evidence of altered cell
morphology or invasion into the normal region from the
dysplasia, nor was there evidence of inflammatory infiltrate
(Figure 1E). In total, 60% of the dysplasias analyzed
(n = 25) (Figure 2A, representative H&E image) showed
regions of elevated Hsp90 in dysplasia adjacent cells with
low levels of β-catenin (Figure 2B (see arrows), Figure
2C). In contrast, cells in regions of normal intestine distal
from dysplasias (> 10 crypts away, Figure 2D) exhibited
uniform and lower levels of Hsp90 and β-catenin (Figure
2E and 2F). Quantification of Hsp90 fluorescence
intensities in dysplasias compared to normal cells adjacent
to dysplasias showed no significant difference in levels,
yet these levels were 1.5-fold greater than in normal cells
greater than 10 crypts away (Figure 2G). Consistent
with previous reports, we could not detect Hsp70 signal
above background in normal cells in the small intestine
and there was no detectable increase in staining in
dysplastic tissue ([22, 29]; data not shown, see Discussion).
We conclude that Hsp90 is up-regulated prior to malignant

levels (green). D. An overlay of β-Catenin and cAPC staining is shown in red and green, respectively. Small arrows denote regions of

tumor formation in pre-cancerous dysplastic regions as
well as in neighboring, non-cancer cells. Although we
cannot rule out that the change in normal cells is caused by
secreted signals from the nearby dysplasia, the fact that not
all normal cells exhibit elevated Hsp90 argues for an intrinsic
cell change.
One possibility is that the APCMin mutation is
directly linked to the elevated levels of Hsp90 found in
both normal and dysplastic intestinal cells. To test this idea,
we compared levels of Hsp90 in normal crypts in wild
type (i.e., APC+/+) and APCMin/+ intestines. To ensure that
we analyzed non-dysplastic crypts in APCMin/+ intestines,
we selected histologically normal regions with low levels
of β-catenin that express full length APC (Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure 1). We found elevated levels of
Hsp90 in all histologically normal crypt and villus cells in
APCMin/+ compared to wild type intestines (Figure 3B, 3C),
albeit at lower than levels found in dysplastic tissue. To
summarize, Hsp90 levels are found in three distinct tiers
in mouse small intestinal cells (Figure 3D). Compared to
the baseline levels of Hsp90 found in APC+/+ intestines,
there is a 1.5-fold increase in Hsp90 in otherwise normal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

APCMin/+ crypt cells prior to loss of heterozygosity at
APC and another 1.5-fold increase in dysplastic cells
or in cells adjacent to the dysplasia (a total of a 3-fold
increase; Figure 3D). The magnitude of Hps90 increase is
significant and comparable to in vivo studies of a variety
of cancers and other physiological stresses [6, 30, 31]}.
The association of elevated Hsp90 with the APCMin allele
prior to cancer onset, supports the idea that APC mutations
are directly responsible for activating cell stress pathways
prior to cancer onset.

APC mutants that inhibit microtubule dynamics
activate a cell stress response
Min mice, as in the majority of human colorectal
cancers, express a monoallelic APC mutation that
encodes for a truncated protein and this single allele is
sufficient to drive the formation of intestinal adenomas
[32, 37]. We have previously shown that truncating
APC mutations found in human colorectal cancers
(e.g., APC1–1450; expressing the first 1450 amino acids)
dominantly inhibit microtubule dynamics by forming

a hetero-oligmoer with full length APC that inhibits the
activity of the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB1
[19, 22, 23, 28]. We confirmed the effect of APC1–1450
on microtubules in a normal diploid epithelial cell line
(hTERT-RPE) by expressing APC1–1450, thus mimicking the
APC heterozygous state. We found that microtubules were
less organized in hTERT-RPE cells expressing APC1–1450
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and that EB1 was observed more consistently along the
length of microtubules, as opposed to strictly in comets at
microtubule plus ends. This change is consistent with there
being fewer growing microtubules (see Supplementary
Figure 2A–2B) and thus altered microtubule dynamics
[33, 38]. To test if the changes in microtubule dynamics
induced byAPC1–1450 also activates the cell stress pathway,

we measured Hsp90 levels by immunofluorescence
using pan-Hsp90 antibodies. Measurements 72 hours
post-transfection showed that expression of APC1–1450
significantly increases Hsp90 levels in the cytosol and
the nucleus compared to control transfection (~48%
increase; compare Figure 4A, 4B and 4E). Similarly, we

also found that levels of the cytosolic chaperone, Hsp27,
are increased after expression of APC1–1450 compared to
control transfection (~29% increase; Figure 4C, 4D and
4F). To verify the changes in protein levels observed by
fluorescence microscopy, we performed immunoblots.
We found both Hsp90 alpha, Hsp90 beta, and Hsp27 were

elevated in cells expressing APC1–1450 compared to control
transfections (Figure 4G). The increase in Hsp levels was
reproducible and are consistent with increases observed
after acute heat stress in mammalian cells and with
exposure of hTERT-RPE cells to heat stress (~1.5–2.0-fold
increase, Figure 4H; unpublished results and [34, 39]). In
contrast, Hsp70 and β-catenin levels remain unaffected
under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 3A and 3C).
Significantly, we also observed an increase in Hsp27
phosphorylation at S82, an activating modification that
has been shown to be sensitive to changes in microtubule
dynamics (Figure 4G, [35, 36, 40–42]).
To test whether APC1–1450 activates the cell stress
pathway via inhibition of microtubule dynamics, we used
an allele with a second mutation in the oligomerization
domain, APC58–1450. APC58–1450 fails to interact with full
length APC and thus does not inhibit microtubule dynamics
[22, 43, 44]. We reasoned that if the increase in HSP levels
induced by APC1–1450 is mediated through a dominant
alteration in microtubule dynamics, transfection of APC58–
1450
should no longer increase HSP expression. Consistent
with this prediction, expression of APC58–1450 failed to
increase levels of Hsp90 alpha, Hsp90 beta, and Hsp27,
as well as Hsp27 S82 phosphoyrlation (Figure 4G). Based
on these results we conclude that APC1–1450 is sufficient to
dominantly activate an arm of the cell stress pathway that
may be specific to cancer (see Discussion), possibly by
inhibiting microtubule dynamics through the EB1 pathway.

the levels of Hsp27 in the cytosol that was confirmed
by immunoblot, although the magnitude of the increase
varied between experiments (Figure 5H–5L and 5M). The
increase in the levels of phosphorylated Hsp27 is similar to
that observed after expression of APC1–1450 and consistent
the idea that changes in microtubule dynamics activate a
p38-stress kinase pathway (Figure 5L). Addition of 1uM
nocodazole resulted in a complete depolymerization of the
microtubule array (Figure 5F) but did not further increase
the levels of Hsp90 (Figure 5C, 5G and 5L). In contrast,
Hsp27 levels further increase when the microtubule
network is completely disrupted (i.e, 1 uM nocodazole,
Figure 5J and 5K). Together, these findings argue that this
cell stress pathway responds to subtle perturbations in
microtubule dynamics. Finally, we confirmed that Hsp70
and β-catenin levels were not affected under any of these
conditions; we therefore conclude that APC mutants
trigger a stress response, distinct from a classic heat shock
response, largely through the inhibition of microtubule
dynamics (Supplementary Figure 3B and 3C).
The range and magnitude of changes in Hsp90 and
Hsp27 as well as the specificity of the response raise the
possibility that decreases in microtubule dynamics leads
to an HSF1-dependent change in gene transcription, akin
to that observed in cancer cells [6, 28]. We tested this
possibility using the HSF1 inhibitor, KRIBB11. KRIBB11
interferes with the ability of HSF1 to recruit transcriptional
elongation factors and prevents stress induced increase in
HSP gene transcription [37, 45–48]. Co-incubation of cells
with 10nM nocodazole with KRIBB11 completely blocked
the increase in Hsp90 and Hsp27 compared to control cells
(Figure 5L and 5M). Consistent with the specific action of
KRIBB11, Hsp27 p-S82 levels were not affected, indicating
that phosphorylation is upstream of HSF1 activity. Together,
these results support a pathway whereby APC mutants alter
microtubule dynamics that in turn increase HSF1 activity
and activate a global cell stress response.

Inhibition of microtubule dynamics is sufficient
to activate the cell stress response
It is possible that this arm of the cell stress pathway
responds to subtle changes in filament dynamics or to
gross perturbations in the organization of the microtubule
network, or to both. Consistent with a role for filament
dynamics and with our previous work, we found that
siRNA of EB1, the microtubule plus-end binding protein
inhibited by APC1–1450 is sufficient to activate the cell stress
pathway. Both Hsp90 and Hsp27 levels are increased
relative to control and Hsp27 p38-kinase modification
increases (see Supplementary Figure 2C–2E, p-S82). To
further address the role of microtubule dynamics in cell
stress pathway activation, we used either micromolar
or nanomolar concentrations of the microtubule poison,
nocodazole to differentially perturb microtubule function.
In hTERT-RPE cells treated with DMSO as a control,
Hsp90 distributes evenly between the cytosol and nucleus
and microtubules form a robust interphase array (Figure
5A and 5D). As expected, treatment of hTERT-RPE cells
with 10nM nocodazole for 12 hours to inhibit filament
dynamics left the microtubule network intact (Figure 5E).
Significantly, these conditions gave rise to a consistently
observed 3-fold increase in the levels of cytoplasmic and
nuclear Hsp90 that was confirmed by immunoblot (Figure
5B, 5G, 5L and 5M). We also observed an increase in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

APC mutants and inhibition of microtubule
dynamics induce Hsf1 activation
Hsf1 regulation is complex but is thought to
involve the stress induced de-repression of the Hsf1
monomer state leading to the formation of Hsf1
trimers, followed by nuclear enrichment and a series of
less well-understood post-translational modifications
[23, 49]. To assess the activation state of Hsf1 under
conditions where microtubule dynamics are inhibited,
we used immunofluorescence to characterize its nuclear
localization. We first tested hTERT-RPE cells expressing
APC1–1450. In control transfections, we observed low levels
of nuclear Hsf1 (Figure 6A). However, in cells expressing
APC1–1450 we observed a significant increase in the levels
of Hsf1 in the nucleus (Figure 6B and 6D). Importantly,
in cells expressing APC58–1450, the double mutant that fails
to inhibit microtubule dynamics, nuclear levels of Hsf1

did not increase, a result that is consistent with the failure
of this mutant to elevate levels of Hsp90 and Hsp27.
Treatment of cells with siRNA against EB1 or low dose
nocodazole (10 nM) to inhibit microtubule dynamics both
resulted in elevated levels of nuclear Hsf1 (Supplementary
Figure 4A and 4B).
As a direct test of Hsf1 activity on target genes,
we analyzed mRNA levels of Hsp90 and Hsp27 using
quantitative PCR in hTERT-RPE cells. We observed
a significant increase in Hsp90 and Hsp27 transcripts
in cells expressing APC1–1450 or treated with low dose
(10 nM) nocodazole (Figure 6E and 6F), consistent with
the magnitude of change previously reported during
heat shock pathway activation [38, 50, 51]. In contrast,
siRNA of EB1 resulted in detectable, but not statistically
significant, increases in HSP transcripts (Supplementary
Figure 4C). This finding is consistent with the less robust
increase in HSP protein levels observed after siRNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

against EB1. We conclude that inhibition of microtubule
dynamics through low dose nocodazole treatment,
or expression of APC1–1450, is sufficient to increase
transcription and expression of Hsp90 and Hsp27 through
the activation and nuclear localization of Hsf1.
The relationship between Hsf1 and cancer initiation
led us to examine the behavior of Hsf1 in intestinal
epithelial cells in APCMin/+ animals. Unfortunately, we
were unable to reliably observe Hsf1 using fluorescence
microscopy; however, immunocytochemistry allowed us to
correlate the relative levels of nuclear Hsf1 with β-catenin
and Hsp90 using serial tissue sections. Dysplastic regions
were identified by elevated levels of β-catenin (Figure 7A).
Using adjacent sections, we observed clear nuclear
enrichment of Hsf1 in cells associated with high levels
of both β-catenin and Hsp90 (Figure 7B–7C and inset 1).
Importantly, in normal cells adjacent to the dysplasia with
high levels of Hsp90, but normal levels of β-catenin, we

also found clear evidence of nuclear Hsf1 (Figure 7A–7C,

generally lower levels of nuclear Hsf1 (Figure 7A–7C,

Hsf1 drives the increases in HSPs observed in normal cells
carrying a single mutation in APC and that these changes
are preserved during cancer progression.

cells and is further activated in cells adjacent to or within
regions that have experienced loss of full length APC. We
establish that chronic inhibition of microtubule dynamics
represents the underlying mechanism that links APC
mutants to an HSF1-dependent cell stress response that
is distinct from the canonical heat shock response. The
action of a monoallelic mutation of APC to induce global
changes in otherwise normal cells raises the possibility
that HSF1-mediated changes act early in cancer onset.
Cancer onset is largely attributed to the presence of
so-called driver mutations identified in studies of mature
tumors that can, when introduced into normal cells,
induce the changes required for cancer initiation [39, 52–
55]. However, the molecular details that accompany the
transition of normal cells to cancer cells remain unclear.
One idea is that early changes in normal cells lead to a
“permissive” environment that precedes cancer cell

DISCUSSION
We have identified a novel link between a
cancer driver mutation in the tumor suppressor gene,
adenomatous polyposis coli, and the activation of a cell
stress pathway, a state that precedes cancer in the intestine
but also anticipates the mature cancer phenotype found
in carcinomas. In APCMin/+ intestines we find that the a cell
stress pathway is activated in histologically normal crypt

transformation. The “cancer field effect”, for example,
posits that there are molecular genetic changes found in
histologically normal cells that border and precede cancer
cell transformation that contribute to oncogenesis [40–
42]. Our results implicate Hsp90 as a novel marker of the
cancer field effect. Hsp90 levels are clearly elevated in
cells that border the small dysplastic lesions defined by
their loss of APC and increase in β-catenin (see Figures
1 and 2). Changes in these border cells might be induced
by neighboring cancer cells or could by cell autonomous
changes, potentially brought on through increased
genome instability [43, 44]. We favor the idea that the
Hsp90 increase is independent of nearby cancer cells, as
Hsp90 levels are already elevated in normal crypt cells
quite far from the nearest dysplastic lesion (see Figure
3). It is possible that increases in Hsp90 are linked to the
chromosome instability previously shown to occur in
cells expressing the APCMin mutation [28]. However, the
incidence of mitotic errors is much less frequent than the
incidence of cells with elevated Hsp90. In addition, our
in vitro work suggests that Hsp90 levels increase due to
cytoskeletal perturbations and not to genomic damage.
We favor the idea that Hsp90 may be a common marker
of cells in the cancer field and that the activation of the
cell stress pathways precedes genomic instability, possibly
providing a “buffer” to mutations that arise later or to
proteomic stress caused by aneuploidy as suggested by
Lindquist and colleauges [45–48].
The activation of cell stress pathways is an
evolutionarily conserved response to changes in cellular
homeostasis typically studied after exogenous insults, such
as heat shock. There is also evidence that HSPs provide
important functions for cells in response to intrinsic signal
transduction pathways. For example, the p38-stress kinase
is activated downstream of growth factors and targets
Hsp27 to help stabilize actin filaments [49]. Studies
of endothelial barrier function have implicated Hsp90
in regulating the Hsp27 response following activation
of signaling pathways or drug treatments that induce
microtubule depolymerization [50, 51]. These studies
and others have provided evidence for cross-talk between
microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton, perhaps most
relevant is the interaction between EB1, APC and Rho to
regulate actin polymerization through formins [52–55].
Although the details underlying these interactions are
far from clear, it is apparent that microtubule dynamics
impact actin organization that in turn triggers Hsp27 in
a regulatory circuit that likely includes the Hsp90 and
Hsf1. Thus, perturbation of microtubule dynamics by the
clinically relevant APC truncated proteins may trigger a
large network of signals that alter microtubules, actin and
ultimately nuclear activities that change the transcriptional
landscape. We speculate that chronic activation of such
pathways provides a survival advantage in evolving
pre-cancer cells as secondary genomic alterations
accumulate (e.g., loss of hetrozygostiy at APC). Additional

characterization of the pathways affected by APC mutants
and the downstream changes will be critical in assessing
the validity of such a model.
Hsf1 is the master regulator of the heat shock
response and our findings argue that APC mutants
associated with human colorectal cancer activate Hsf1. We
find an increase in mRNA from HSP genes that regulated
by Hsf1 and chemical inhibition of Hsf1 prevents the
accumulation of HSPs after inhibition of microtubule
dynamics in vitro. Remarkably, any of the conditions used
to inhibit microtubule dynamics also causes an enrichment
of Hsf1 in the nucleus of RPE-hTERT cells. Although
the nuclear enrichment is required for its transcriptional
activity, the regulatory scheme for Hsf1 nuclear import
and transcription indicates that an inactive pool of Hsf1
can be imported into the nucleus, arguing that nuclear
import and transcription are separable [2, 56]. This may
explain why siRNA against EB1 causes Hsf1 to become
enriched in the nucleus without a corresponding increase
in HSP mRNA. One potential outcome of Hsf1 activation
is that cells with chronic perturbations in microtubule
dynamics will have increased levels of HSPs; this may
provide for a more robust environment that can support
malignant transformation events. In this case, increases
in Hsp90 may serve to stabilize active Ras mutants or
may prevent p53 activation, steps that presumably must
occur at some frequency for intestinal cancers to develop
[1, 57]. Alternatively, Hsf1 may have more direct role
in deregulating cell growth and division pathways that
contribute to inappropriate cell division. Mendillo and
colleagues showed that in cancer cells, Hsf1 targets
promoters that are distinct from those it binds to after heat
shock. A dramatic case in point is the gene encoding for
Hsp70. In cancer cells, Hsp70 mRNA and Hsf1 binding at
the promoter is low compared to other regions, suggesting
a distinct Hsf1-mediated transcriptional program [2, 5–8].
We also find that Hsp70 does not respond to mutations in
APC or inhibition of microtubule dynamics, suggesting
this response is more akin to the Hsf1-mediated cancer
program than a canonical heat shock program. Thus,
a single APC mutant may induce an Hsf1 program that
anticipates cancer.
In summary, this work sheds light on a novel
pathway that links APC mutants found in cancers to early
activation of a cell stress pathway, that target a network
of genes and proteins that have a well-established role
in modulating cell fate. The important implication is
that early activation of this cell stress network may aid
the transition of a normal cell into a cancer cell, one that
continues to evolve malignant phenotypes. Significantly,
this work also provides a novel set of biomarkers to
expand our definition of potentially cancer prone tissue.
Our findings help establish a novel path to explore the
changes that precede cancer cell transformation and how
cell stress pathways contribute to cancer initiation and
progression.

secondary goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680CW and goat anti
mouse IRDye 800CW 1:10, 000 (Licor, Lincoln, NE) were
use according the manufactures directions. Images were
collected using a Licor Odyssey system. Signal intensities
were measured using ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.
gov/ij/). and analyzed using statistical analysis software
as outlined below.

Cell culture, transfection, siRNA, and inhibitor
treatments
Human hTERT-RPE cell lines, obtained from ATCC,
were grown in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum,
sodium pyruvate, GlutaMAX, and Penicillin/Streptomycin
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), with media changed
every 2–3 days.
For transfection experiments, a CMV-driven
13-myc-APC1–1450 plasmid was constructed as previously
described (Caldwell and Kaplan, 2007). RPE cells were
plated to approximately 80% confluence in 6-well culture
dishes and allowed to grow overnight under standard
growth conditions. Cells were then transfected with
13-myc-APC1–1450, or control plasmid, using Mirus (Mirus
Bio, Madison, WI) transfection reagent according to the
manufacturers instructions. Cells were harvested for
immunoblot or immunofluorescence 48–72 hours posttransfection.
For siRNA experiments, cells were split into
6-well culture dishes, then grown overnight under
standard conditions in OptiMEM media (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The next day a custom
EB1 siRNA, sequence GUGAAAUUCCAAGCUAA
GCdTdT (GE Heathcare Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO),
was prepared to the indicated final concentration per well
in Oligofectamine (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturers instructions. The cultures
were grown overnight, FBS was then added to a final
concentration of 5%, and the cultures were then allowed
to grow an additional 48 hours under standard conditions
before harvesting for immunofluorescence or western
blotting.
For nocodazole experiments, hTERT-RPE cells were
plated to approximately 60% confluency in 6-well culture
dishes and allowed to grow overnight under standard
growth conditions. Nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO), or DMSO vehicle control, was added at the indicated
concentration and cells were harvested 12 hours posttreatment. For Hsf1 inhibition experiments, KRIBB11
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), or a DMSO vehicle
control, were added alone at indicated concentrations, or
simultaneously with nocodazole, and harvested 12 hours
post-treatment.

Mouse tissues
Wild-type and Min mouse tissues were obtained in
accordance with approved UC Davis Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee protocols as previously described
[18, 28]. Mouse small intestinal tissues were harvested
from 20-week old mice and genotyped. Intestinal
tissues were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde and paraffin
embedded. A total of 9 genotyped mice were used for each
experiment (4 wild type and 5 Min heterozygotes).

Immunofluoresence of cell culture and tissue
samples
Cell lines were plated on ethanol rinsed cover slips,
then cultured as described above. The cells were grown
overnight, media removed, and rinsed in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2 then fixed for 20 minutes
in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at 37°C as previously
described [6, 21, 23, 58].
Five micron tissue sections were cut from paraffin
embedded mouse intestine. The cut sections were then
deparaffinized using three xylene washes and three ethanol
washes (100%, 95%, 70% ethanol, respectively), then
rinsed in tap water for five minutes. Antigen retrieval was
conducted in 10mM Citrate Buffer with 0.1% tween for 30
minutes at 95C. Tissues were then treated with hydrogen
peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase treatment, if
3, 3′ diaminobenzadine staining was to be conducted, or
sections were blocked and stained for immunofluorescence
as described above. For 3, 3′ diaminobenzidine staining
the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit was used according
to manufacturers directions (Vector Laboratories Inc.,
Burlingame, CA).
For cell culture and mouse tissue staining
experiments, rabbit anti-pan Hsp90 was used at 1:100
(Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), mouse anti-βcatenin at 1:200 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), rabbit
anti-cAPC at 1:100 (Produced in-house as previously
described (Caldwell and Kaplan, 2007) diluted in
