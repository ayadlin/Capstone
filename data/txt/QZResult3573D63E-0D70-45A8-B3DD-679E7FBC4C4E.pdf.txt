BACKGROUND: Interferon-a is a cytokine that has demonstrated activity in patients with supratentorial gliomas, but
its ideal dose and schedule of administration is unknown. Studies suggest that low-dose, continuous exposure is
more efficacious than intermittent, high doses. The authors performed a phase 2 study of recombinant interferon
a-2b with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG-IntronV) in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a
population with dismal survival despite decades of clinical investigation. The primary objective was to compare 2year survival with a historic cohort that received radiation therapy alone. METHODS: Patients received weekly subcutaneous PEG-IntronV at a dose of 0.3 lg/kg beginning 2 to 10 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy until
they developed disease progression. Patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically at regular intervals. Serum and urine were assayed for biomarkers before each cycle. Quality-of-life (QOL) evaluations were administered at
baseline and before every other cycle of therapy to the parents of patients ages 6 to 18 years. RESULTS: Thirty-two
patients (median age, 5.3 years; range, 1.8-14.8 years) were enrolled and received a median of 7 cycles of therapy
(range, from 1 cycle to 70 cycles). PEG-IntronV was well tolerated, and no decrease in QOL scores was noted in the
subset of patients tested. The 2-year survival rate was 14%, which was not significantly improved compared with the
historic cohort. However, the median time to progression was 7.8 months, which compared favorably with recent trials
reporting a time to progression of 5 months in a similar population. CONCLUSIONS: Although low-dose PEG-IntronV
therapy did not significantly improve 2-year survival in children with DIPG compared with an historic control populaC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) account for up to 80% of brainstem tumors in the pediatric population,1
and an estimated 300 children are diagnosed in the United States each year. Because of the tenuous location of these
tumors, surgical resection is not possible, and the mainstay of treatment is radiation therapy. The majority of patients
(approximately 75%) initially will improve clinically with radiation therapy, but tumor control is short-lived. Adjuvant
chemotherapy has not significantly improved outcomes. Recent Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) trials2,3
have demonstrated an expected median progression-free survival (PFS) of <5 months in a homogeneously defined population of children with DIPG (personal communication, James Boyett). Two most recent national consortia trials (Children’s Oncology Group trial COG ACNS0126 and Children’s Cancer Group trial CCG-9941) reported mean (standard
deviation) 1-year overall survival (OS) rates of 40%  6.5% and 32%  6%, respectively,4 confirming the absence of progress in improving outcome and emphasizing the need for new approaches to therapy.
The interferons (IFNs) are a family of glycoproteins with antiproliferative, antiviral, and immune-modulating
effects.5-7 Clinical studies using a, b, and c IFNs in patients with malignant brain tumors, including brainstem gliomas,
have been performed with reported response rates of up to 40%.8-10 Despite the various clinical studies performed using
IFNs, the ideal route of administration, schedule, and dose necessary to produce maximum antitumor effects remain

unknown. IFN traditionally has been administered intravenously at high doses (3,000,000 U/m2, 2-3 times
weekly), but significant side effects, including neurotoxicity, have limited its use.8 In a follow-up study of pediatric
patients with brainstem glioma who received intravenous
recombinant b-IFN during hyperfractionated radiation
therapy, 13 of 32 patients (41%) required dose modifications because of hepatic or hematologic toxicity.11
A recent in vitro study compared high-dose administration versus frequent low-dose administration of IFNa-2a.12 Frequent low-dose administration produced more
significant inhibition of angiogenesis-regulating genes, tumor vascularization, and tumor growth compared with
the higher intermittent dose schedule.12 These effects
were lost at higher doses, suggesting that metronomic
administration of IFNs may have a more robust antitumor effect.
A covalent conjugate of recombinant IFN a-2b with
monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG-IntronV) has
received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with hepatitis C at a dose
of 1 lg/kg per week. Pegylation increases the biologic
half-life of the compound, enabling once weekly administration and reducing the peaks and troughs in IFN a-2b
blood levels. Maximum serum concentrations of PEGIntronV occur between 15 and 44 hours after dosing and
are sustained for up to 72 hours.13
We performed a study administering weekly dosing
of PEG-IntronV as a means of establishing continuous
low-dose levels of IFN in children with DIPG. The dose
selected was the human equivalent of the IFN a2a dose
with greatest observed antitumor activity used in the study
by Slaton et al.12 Our primary objectives were to determine its tolerability and to compare the 2-year survival of
children with DIPG who received weekly low-dose PEGIntronV after standard radiation therapy versus historic
controls who received radiation therapy alone. Secondary
objectives of this trial included determination of the time
to progression, exploration of potential biomarkers, and
evaluation of quality of life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients aged 21 years with a DIPG who received radiation only and no prior chemotherapy or radiosensitizers
were eligible. For this study, DIPG was defined as a diffuse intrinsic tumor on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) with the epicenter presumed to be in the pons, a

3608

signal abnormality involving 50% of the pons on the
T2-weighted sequence at diagnosis, involvement of the
ventral pons, and no primary exophytic component.
Patients with known or suspected neurofibromatosis type
1 were excluded. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 3; adequate
hematologic function defined as an absolute neutrophil
count >1000/mm3, hemoglobin >8 g/dL, and platelet
count >100,000/mm3; adequate renal function defined
as a normal, age-adjusted creatinine level or creatinine
clearance 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; and adequate hepatic
function defined as a total bilirubin level 2.0 times the
upper limit of normal, direct bilirubin within normal limits, and an alanine aminotransferase level <2.5 times the
upper limit of normal. Patients had to be on a stable or
decreasing dose of steroids for 1 week before study
entry. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board, and continuing approval was maintained throughout the study. All patients or their legal guardians signed a
document of informed consent, and verbal assent was
obtained from patients when appropriate.
Study Design
R
Treatment with PEG-IntronV was initiated 2 to 10 weeks
after completion of radiation therapy. Each cycle of therR
apy consisted of 0.3 lg/kg PEG-IntronV administered
subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks. Initially, patients were
instructed to receive premedication with acetaminophen
or ibuprofen, but this was omitted later because of an abR
sence of PEG-IntronV side effects. Treatment with PEGR
V
Intron continued until patients developed unacceptable
toxicity or disease progression. Disease progression was
defined radiographically as the presence of new areas of
tumor or an increase 25% in tumor size, defined clinically as worsening neurologic symptoms despite an
increase in steroids, or worsening neurologic symptoms
with any increase in tumor size. Attempts were made
using proton spectroscopy, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron
emission tomography imaging, and steroid trials to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumor progression in children with worsening neurologic symptoms and debatable
findings on MRI.
R
Dosing of PEG-IntronV was held for any grade 3 or
4 nonhematologic toxicity probably or definitely attribR
uted to PEG-IntronV, with the exception of fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and rigors. If a toxicity did not return to
R
grade 1 within 14 days, then PEG-IntronV was discontinued. If the toxicity returned to grade 1 within 14
days, then the patient was permitted to restart PEG-

IntronV at 50% of the dose (ie, 0.15 lg/kg once weekly)
and to remain at that dose. If the toxicity recurred and was
attributable to PEG-IntronV, then no further PEGIntronV was given. Patients who had hematologic toxicity
defined as an absolute neutrophil count <500 for 5
consecutive days or who required platelet transfusions on
>2 days of any 1 cycle for platelet counts <50,000/lL
discontinued PEG-IntronV therapy. Patients who discontinued PEG-IntronV therapy remained on study for endpoint analysis only.

Patient Evaluation
Patients received a monthly physical examination, including a detailed neurologic examination. A complete blood
count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum
total bilirubin, and alanine aminotransferase levels were
obtained at baseline and weekly during the first cycle. If no
laboratory toxicity grade >1 was observed during the first
cycle, then a complete blood count was performed every 2
weeks on subsequent cycles and as clinically indicated.
Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, uric acid, and urinalysis
were evaluated before each cycle and as clinically indicated. Serum and urine were assayed for both basic fibroblast factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) levels before the start of each new cycle (ie,
every 28 days). Parents of children ages 6 to 18 years with
DIPG completed the Impact of Pediatric Illness (IPI)
Scale14 to assess quality of life (QOL) at baseline and every
other cycle. This scale measures 4 domains: daily activities, medical/physical status, emotional functioning, and
cognitive problems. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert
scale, and higher scores indicate better QOL.
Radiographic Response Assessment
Standard MRI scans to determine disease status were
obtained before cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, every other month
thereafter, and when clinically indicated. Brain MRI scans
included proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion-weighted, dynamic-enhanced, and
dynamic susceptibility MR sequences when possible.
Biomarker Analysis
Patient specimens were collected and immediately stored
at 80 C until assayed. Samples were thawed on wet ice
3 hours before assay. Serum/urine bFGF-1 and matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were completed according to
manufacturer protocols (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,

Cancer

Minn). Samples were plated onto 96-well plates in duplicate, and conjugated secondary antibody was added. The
substrate solution (H202/tetramethylbenzidine) was then
administered for 30 minutes, and the reaction subsequently was quenched with sulfuric acid. Plates were read
at an absorbance of 450 nm on a Victor 3 plate reader
(Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass). The extrapolated absorbance was analyzed using Masterplex Readerfit ELISA software (Hitachi, Waltham, Mass), and the concentration
was determined following a 4 Parameter Logistic curve fit
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. VEGF
levels in serum and urine specimens were measured using
an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay according to
the manufacturer protocol (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Md). Samples were assayed in 96-well plates,
incubated with antihuman-VEGF antibody, and read
with an MSD Sector imager (Meso Scale Discovery).
Concentrations were determined using a 4 Parameter
Logistic curve fit. Urinary biomarker values were normalized for creatinine levels obtained using the Bayer DCA
2000þ Analyzer (Bayer Healthcare, Elkhart, Ind) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of this trial was to compare the survival of patients who received radiation therapy followed by
R
PEG-IntronV versus an historic cohort of patients who
received radiation alone. On the basis of a literature review
from 1980 to 2000, the median survival for children who
received radiation therapy only was approximately 11
months, and the 2-year survival rate was <20%.15-17 A
1-tailed exact binomial test of p ¼ 0.2 at the 0.1 significance
level was used for analysis. With a sample size of 32 patients,
the power to distinguish a 2-year survival rate of 40% (H1)
from the historic control rate of 20% (H0) was 88%. OS
was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of
death. Analyses of toxicity and tolerability were descriptive.
Evaluations for the secondary objectives were
planned for all patients, although neuropsychological testing was not performed if the patient was ill. Total mean
parent IPI Scale scores were compared from baseline to
precycle 3 using repeated-measures analyses of variance.

administration of PEG-IntronV. This was amended later
to administer as needed, as most families were not administering acetaminophen or ibuprofen because of the lack
of PEG-IntronV toxicity. There were no grade 4 toxicities
attributed to PEG-IntronV. Twenty episodes of grade 3
toxicities at least possibly attributed to PEG-IntronV therapy were reported, including asymptomatic laboratory
abnormalities (neutropenia, n ¼ 11; leukopenia, n ¼ 1;
lymphopenia, n ¼ 2; and elevated alanine aminotransferase, n ¼ 1), fever (n ¼ 1), cranial neuropathy (n ¼ 2), and

years at diagnosis. The majority of patients began radiation within 6 weeks of becoming symptomatic; 1 patient
who was diagnosed with DIPG as an incidental finding
deferred radiation therapy for 5 months, at which time
she was symptomatic. Another patient had an abnormal
MRI scan with a ‘‘lacy signal abnormality’’ in the pons 3.5
years before enrolling on study; his symptoms at that time
were headaches and vertigo. Because the radiographic and
clinical features were atypical for DIPG, he was not
treated at the time and was followed by imaging. His tumor progressed 3.5 years later both clinically and radiographically, evolving into a typical radiographic
appearance for DIPG. He began radiation therapy within
1 month of progression.
Overall, the median time from end of radiation to
enrollment on protocol was 38 days (range, 15-64 days).
Six patients had an increase in tumor size between diagnosis and their first postradiation scan, before starting PEGIntronV. Eighteen patients remained on steroids at the

The overall 2-year survival rate from diagnosis was

IntronV. The median time to progression from diagnosis
was 235 days, and the median OS from diagnosis was 351
days. The Kaplan-Meier OS estimate (standard error) at
1-year was 0.4643  0.0918 (Figure 1). With the 2 outlying patients (ie, those who delayed the start of radiation)

the median OS remained 351 days, and the Kaplan-Meier

Biomarkers
Serial serum and urine samples were available for 27
patients. We used a stepwise threshold analysis to evaluate
whether biomarkers could be used as markers of treatment
futility. Because VEGF and bFGF are 2 presumptive
effector molecules for IFN a-2b therapy, we initially used
a threshold of 2.2 pg/mg for normalized urinary VEGF
and 6.0 pg/mL for serum bFGF. By using these thresholds, 17 patients had VEGF values >2.2 pg/mg and
bFGF values >6.0 pg/mL, and each of these patients

progressed before 2 years. In the remaining 10 patients,
using a threshold for serum MMP-9 of 5 ng/mL after the
first cycle of therapy, 4 additional patients failed within 2
years. Of the remaining 6 patients, those 4 patients with a
low initial VEGF and bFGF values and a nonrising
MMP-9 value survived for >2 years.
Quality-of-Life Analysis
Of the 32 children enrolled, 11 were in the age range for
the IPI Scale and received a baseline QOL assessment. Of
these patients, 3 were not evaluated before cycle 3 because
R
of scheduling issues, and 1 discontinued PEG-IntronV
because of progressive disease; therefore, precycle 3 evaluations were completed on 7 patients. The mean age of
these patients at baseline was 9.4 years (range, 7.5-12.3
years). Total mean scores improved significantly from
baseline to the precycle 3 assessment (baseline, from 3.59
to 3.89 [precycle 3]; F ¼ 6.51; p ¼ .0434), suggesting an
early improvement in QOL over the first 2 months of the
study. Four patients had an improvement in their mean
total score (scores increased by 0.5 standard deviation),
3 had stable scores, and none of the 7 patients’ mean total
scores declined by 0.5 standard deviation.

DISCUSSION
Although IFNs have several effects on the growth and proliferation of cells and have demonstrated variable activity
against gliomas in clinical trials, the ideal dose, schedule,
and type of IFN for antiglioma activity have not been identified. In the current clinical trial evaluating continuous,
low-dose exposure of IFN a-2b in children with DIPG,
our results indicate that PEG-IntronV administered as
monotherapy after radiation therapy was not effective in
significantly improving 2-year survival compared with our
defined historic cohort of children who received radiation
only. However, compared with more recent trials that had
a similarly defined patient populations, our results suggest
that the time to progression may be prolonged.
The historic control cohort initially defined in this
protocol was based on a literature review that spanned the
period when routine use of MRI scans was increasing and
when subsets of brainstem gliomas were being defined.17
Although brainstem tumors are now recognized as a heterogeneous group of tumors with some subsets, such as focal
or primary exophytic, that have superior outcomes compared with diffuse intrinsic lesions,18 many clinical trials
performed within the historic period did not distinguish
these tumors. Consequently, the median survival and the
R

Cancer

July 15, 2012

OS of the historic cohort may be erroneously high. Our
results compare favorably with more recent clinical studies
of defined DIPG populations, including the ACNS0126
trial, which reported a 2-year OS rate of 3.6%  2.5%,4
and the series of recent PBTC clinical trials, in which the
estimated time to progression from diagnosis was <5
months. Two patients had a somewhat atypical course, in
that they delayed radiation therapy after initial diagnosis,
as indicated in Table 2. However, those patients met criteria for the diagnosis of DIPG and, at the time they began
radiation therapy, followed a typical course. One of these
patients died of disease 17 months after beginning radiation therapy for DIPG. The other remained alive 34
months after radiation therapy but had progressive disease
identified <2 years from diagnosis. This suggests that,
although the preradiation course was prolonged, once the
patients required standard treatment for their DIPG, they
followed a more typical course.
The current study highlights the difficulties and limitations of performing clinical trials in children with
DIPG. In addition to a limited historic cohort, several
restrictions exist, including the lack of a tissue diagnosis
and absence of a standard definition of progression. The
small number of patients makes it difficult to complete
trials quickly and to detect modest improvements in outcome. Evaluating response to therapy for patients with
brain tumors, particularly DIPG, also is challenging,
because MRI cannot clearly distinguish tumor progression from the effects of treatment. This is made even more
complicated when evaluating noncytotoxic agents, including those with an unclear or multipronged mechanism of
action, such as the IFNs.
The antitumor mechanism of action of IFNs is not
fully understood. The IFNs are involved in the control of
cell function and replication. The type I IFNs, IFN-a and
IFN-b, are negative regulators of cell growth and can modify cell differentiation.19 They inhibit mitotic activity,
block transition from the G0/G1 phase into the S phase of
the cell cycle, and suppress expression of receptors for certain growth factors.20-23 They down-regulate the expression of proangiogenic molecules including, bFGF,
interleukin 8, MMP-2 and MMP-912;and chronic systemic administration has produced regression of vascular
tumors.24-26 The type I IFNs also play a role in tumor
immunosurveillance.27 Impaired IFN-a production has
been associated with an increased risk of cancer and an
increased rate of tumor growth in mouse glioma models.28
To date, no blood or tissue biomarker has been identified that reliably predicts response to treatment or

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PEGIntronV administered to children with DIPG after radiation therapy does not improve 2-year OS compared with
an historic control population. However, patients on this
study had prolonged time to progression compared with a
contemporary, similarly defined population, and no significant adverse effect on QOL was observed in the small
number of patients evaluated. Thus, PEG-IntronV may
not be adequate as monotherapy, but its use in combination studies may be appropriate.

reflects response to antiangiogenic agents, although several potential candidates are under investigation. Evaluations of blood and urine markers rather than tissue
markers are more appropriate for the DIPG population
because of the inability to sample tumor tissue. VEGF,
bFGF, and MMPs have demonstrated prognostic value in
different tumor types.29 It was reported previously that
urinary VEGF levels are predictive of outcome in cancer
patients who receive radiation therapy,30 and bFGF levels
in urine have been correlated with disease status in cancer
patients.31 IFN a-2b inhibits angiogenic factor expression
by decreasing production.32 An intriguing finding in our
current study was the use of early biomarkers to identify
long-term survivors. Although the number of patients was
small, 4 of 6 patients who had low urine VEGF, low serum bFGF levels, and a nonrising MMP-9 level survived
for 2 years; whereas no patient with a high urine VEGF
level, a high serum bFGF level, or a rising MMP-9 level
was a long-term survivor. Thus, a combination of biomarkers may be useful in identifying patients who may
respond to IFN a-2b therapy.
The current clinical trial demonstrates the tolerability of PEG-IntronV in this patient population. This was
not unexpected, because we used a dose much lower than
the FDA-approved dose of PEG-IntronV. Although the
QOL results should be interpreted with caution because
of the limited number of patients evaluated, and although
improved QOL scores may be related at least in part to
symptomatic improvement from radiation therapy, a detrimental effect on QOL was not observed in any patient
assessed. This is in marked contrast to prior studies of
IFNs that demonstrated significant toxicities, resulting in
dose reduction or discontinuation.10,11,33
