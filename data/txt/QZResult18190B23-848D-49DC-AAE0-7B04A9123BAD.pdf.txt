ABSTRACT
The immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) mutational status is
a strong determinant of remission duration in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
The aim of this work was to compare the multidrug resistance (MDR) signature of
IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL cells, identifying biochemical and molecular targets
potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention.
We found that the mevalonate pathway-dependent Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/
RhoA kinase signaling cascades, and the downstream HIF-1α/P-glycoprotein axis
were more active in IGHV unmutated than in mutated cells, leading to a constitutive
protection from doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. The constitutive MDR phenotype
of IGHV unmutated cells was partially dependent on B cell receptor signaling, as
shown by the inhibitory effect exerted by ibrutinib. Stromal cells further protected
IGHV unmutated cells from doxorubicin by upregulating Ras/ERK1–2, RhoA/RhoA
kinase, Akt, HIF-1α and P-glycoprotein activities. Mevalonate pathway inhibition
with simvastatin abrogated these signaling pathways and reversed the resistance of
IGHV unmutated cells to doxorubicin, also counteracting the protective effect exerted
by stromal cells. Similar results were obtained via the targeted inhibition of the
downstream molecules ERK1–2, RhoA kinase and HIF-1α.
Therefore, targeting the mevalonate pathway and its downstream signaling cascades
is a promising strategy to circumvent the MDR signature of IGHV unmutated CLL cells.

cells display inferior survival rates [1, 2] and shorter complete
remission duration than IGHV mutated (M) patients [3].

from spontaneous apoptosis and drug-induced cytotoxicity.

signals for their survival [4]. However, whether IGHV M
and UM CLL cells differ for their ex vivo susceptibility to
chemotherapy is controversial [5, 6].
Results from clinical trials have shown that
fludarabine, even when used as a single agent, induced
higher remission rates than other chemotherapies, such
as CAP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone)
or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
prednisone), in previously untreated CLL patients [7,
8]. However, the reasons accounting for the lower
effectiveness of anthracycline-containing regimens in CLL
remain largely unexplored.
One of the main mechanisms of chemoresistance
is the overexpression of membrane transporters which
actively extrude chemotherapy drugs, a process called
multidrug resistance (MDR). Anthracyclines, such as
doxorubicin (Doxo), are substrates of one of the best
characterized drug efflux pump, the P-glycoprotein (Pgp/
ABCB1), which is encoded by the MDR1 gene [9].
Pgp activity is directly related to the amount of
cell cholesterol in the plasma membrane [10], and its
expression is regulated by the transcription factor hypoxiainducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), whose activation
is dependent on Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase
signaling pathways [11].
All these pathways are under the control of the
mevalonate (Mev) pathway, a highly conserved metabolic
cascade which produces sterols, such as cholesterol,
and isoprenoids, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)
and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). The latter
are necessary for the isoprenylation of Ras and RhoA
GTPases, and for the activation of their downstream
signaling pathways [12].
The Mev pathway can be pharmacologically
inhibited using statins (e.g. simvastatin, SIM) or amino­
bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid, ZA) [13], and we
have already shown that ZA can restore the sensitivity of
MDR positive (MDR+) solid tumor cell lines to Doxo [14].
CLL cells carrying IGHV UM genes have
significantly higher levels of Mev pathway activity, which
are thought amenable to pharmacological manipulation
by SIM and ZA [15]. It is currently unknown whether
the higher activity of the Mev pathway in IGHV UM
cells translates into a MDR+ phenotype, and whether the
targeted inhibition of the Mev pathway or downstream
signaling can eventually counteract the MDR+ signature
of CLL cells.
The aim of this study was twofold: 1) to
characterize the MDR status of IGHV M and UM
cells, by evaluating the activity of Ras/ERK1–2,
RhoA/RhoA kinases, and HIF-1α/Pgp axis under basal
conditions and after exposure to SCs; 2) to determine
whether targeting the Mev pathway and its downstream
signaling eventually restores the sensitivity of MDR+
CLL cells to Doxo.

The Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase
signaling pathways and the HIF-1α/Pgp axis are
more active in IGHV UM than M CLL cells
The activity of Ras- and RhoA-dependent
signaling pathways was analyzed in IGHV M and UM
CLL cells (>90% pure as described below) after ex
vivo culture for 24 hours. Both type of cells exhibited
detectable amounts of non-isoprenylated cytosolic Ras
and unphosphorylated ERK1–2, but only IGHV UM cells
showed high intracellular levels of the Ras GTP-bound
active form and the Ras-downstream effector kinase
phospho-ERK1–2 (Figure 1A, left), in keeping with their
accelerated Mev pathway activity [15]. Similarly, the
amount of active GTP-bound RhoA and the activity of
the downstream RhoA kinase were significantly higher in
IGHV UM than M cells (p always = 0.001) (Figure 1A,
right).
Both ERK1–2 and RhoA kinase phosphorylate
and activate the transcription factor HIF-1α [16, 17].
Accordingly, the activation of Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/
RhoA kinase signalling pathways in IGHV UM cells led
to the phosphorylation of HIF-1α (Supplementary Figure
S1) and to the increase of its transcriptional activity, as
shown by the significantly higher amounts of nuclear
HIF-1α bound to its specific DNA target sequence (p =
0.002) (Figure 1B, left). As a consequence, IGHV UM
cells showed higher MDR1 mRNA expression (Figure 1B,
right) and lower Doxo accumulation than IGHV M cells (p
always = 0.001) (Figure 1C).
In agreement with our previous data [4], both
untreated IGHV M and UM cells showed high levels of
viability after ex vivo culture for 48 hours, whereas Doxo
treatment induced a significant decrease of viability in
IGHV M compared to UM CLL cells (p = 0.001) (Figure
1D and Supplementary Figure S2).

The constitutive MDR phenotype of IGHV UM
cells depends on BCR signaling and is further
upregulated by SC-mediated extrinsic signals
IGHV UM cells display an increased signaling
through the B cell receptor (BCR) compared to IGHV M
cells [18]. To study the effect of BCR signaling on Mevregulated pathways and MDR phenotype we incubated
IGHV M and UM cells with anti-IgM antibody, in the
presence or absence of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)
inhibitor ibrutinib. Anti-IgM-mediated BCR stimulation
did not increase the baseline production of cholesterol
and FPP (Figure 2A), the amount of GTP-bound
RhoA and the activity of RhoA kinase (Figure 2B), the
transcriptional activity of HIF-1α and the expression of
its target gene MDR1 (Figure 2C) in both IGHV M and
UM cells. Of note, ibrutinib-mediated BCR inhibition

Figure 1: The Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling pathways and the HIF-1α/Pgp axis are more active in
IGHV UM than M CLL cells. The activity of the Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling cascades and the HIF-1α/Pgp axis

were measured in CLL cells isolated from the peripheral blood of IGHV M and UM patients after 24-hour ex vivo culture. A. Ras and
ERK1–2 kinase activities were measured by Western Blot (WB) (left side). IGHV UM cells have a higher expression of the active forms of
Ras (Ras GTP) and ERK1–2 (pERK1–2), than IGHV M cells. Results are from 3 representative experiments for both M and UM patients
(UPN, unique patient number). RhoA GTP and RhoA Kinase activities were measured by ELISA assays (right side). IGHV UM cells have
higher activities of RhoA GTP and RhoA Kinase compared to M cells (*p = 0.001). B. HIF-1α activity and MDR1 mRNA expression. IGHV
UM cells have higher HIF-1α activity compared to M cells (*p = 0.002) after 24 hours of culture. At the same time-point, significantly
higher MDR1 levels were observed in IGHV UM cells than in M cells (*p = 0.001). C. Intracellular Doxo accumulation. Significantly lower
concentrations of Doxo were detected after 48-hour ex vivo exposure in IGHV UM than in M cells (*p = 0.001). D. Viability of CD19+/
CD5+ cells was determined by Annexin-V (Ann-V) staining and cytofluorimetric analysis after 48-hour Doxo exposure. IGHV UM cells
showed higher levels of viability than M cells (*p = 0.001). Results are from 7 experiments for both M and UM patients. In all panels, bars
represent mean values ± SEM.

SIM effectively reverses the MDR phenotype
of IGHV UM cells and restores Doxo-induced
cytotoxicity

significantly decreased the constitutively higher levels of
cholesterol and FPP production, RhoA and RhoA kinase
activity, HIF-1α transcriptional activity and MDR1
expression in IGHV UM cells (p always ≤ 0.05), whereas
it did not affect the Mev pathway and Mev-regulated
signaling in IGHV M cells.
SCs are known to confer a chemoresistant phenotype
to CLL cells [19–21]. Therefore, we also sought whether
IGHV M and UM cells co-cultured with the murine
stromal cell line M2–10B4 upregulated the Mev pathway
and the RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling pathways. IGHV M
and UM cells showed high and comparable levels of cell
viability after 24-hour ex vivo culture, both in the presence
and in the absence of SCs (data not shown). After exposure
to M2–10B4 SCs, the production of cholesterol and FPP
(Figure 3A), the amount of GTP-bound RhoA and the
activity of RhoA kinase (Figure 3B), the transcriptional
activity of HIF-1α, and the expression of its target gene
MDR1 (Figure 3C) were significantly increased in IGHV
UM but not in M CLL cells (p always ≤ 0.03).

We next examined whether SIM, which switches off
the Mev pathway downstream to the rate-controlling enzyme
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, was effective in
reversing the MDR phenotype of IGHV UM cells.
In IGHV UM cells, SIM significantly reduced
cholesterol and FPP production (p always ≤ 0.05) (Figure 4A),
the amounts of GTP-bound Ras and phospho-ERK1–2 kinases
(Figure 4B), the amounts of GTP-bound RhoA and the activity
of RhoA kinase (Figure 4C), also abrogating the upregulating
effect exerted by M2–10B4 SCs (p always ≤ 0.0005).
This SIM-mediated inhibition of the Mev pathway
and downstream signaling pathways was paralleled by a
lower HIF-1α phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S3)
and a statistically significant decrease in HIF-1α activity and
MDR1 expression in IGHV UM cells, both in the presence
or absence of SCs (p always < 0.003) (Figure 5A, 5B). Thus,

SIM significantly increased the accumulation of intracellular
Doxo, even in the presence of SCs (p always ≤ 0.002) (Figure
5C). The SIM-induced increase in Doxo accumulation
determined an enhanced cytotoxic death of IGHV UM cells
after exposure to the combination SIM+Doxo for 48 hours (p
≤ 0.0001). Interestingly, SIM was also effective in reversing
the protective effect exerted by M2–10B4 SCs (p ≤ 0.0001)
(Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure S4).

and also in IGHV UM cells cultured with M2–10B4 SCs (p
≤ 0.03) (Supplementary Figure S5A, S5B). Moreover, ZA
was effective in reducing the amount of the active GTPbound form of Ras and phospho-ERK1–2, even in the
presence of the M2–10B4 SCs (Supplementary Figure S5C,
S5D). Similarly, the exposure of IGHV UM cells to ZA
significantly reduced the amount of the active GTP-bound
form of RhoA and the activity of the downstream RhoA
kinase, irrespective of the presence or absence of SCs (p
always ≤ 0.01) (Supplementary Figure S5E, S5F).
The inhibition of Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/RhoA
kinase signaling was paralleled by a reduction of HIF1α phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S6), and
a significant decrease in HIF-1α activity and MDR1
expression in the presence or absence of SCs (p always ≤
0.05) (Supplementary Figure S7A, S7B).

SIM effectively abrogates SC-induced Akt
upregulation in IGHV UM cells
We next examined the effect of another Mev pathway
inhibitor, ZA, which switches off the pathway downstream
to FPP-synthase. ZA significantly abrogated cholesterol and
FPP synthesis in IGHV UM cells cultured alone (p ≤ 0.05),

Figure 2: Ibrutinib inhibits the Mev pathway activity, the RhoA/RhoA kinase cascade and the HIF-1α/Pgp axis in
IGHV UM but not in IGHV M cells. IGHV M and UM cells were stimulated for 24 hours with anti-IgM (10 μg/well) in the absence

or presence of 30-minute pre-incubation with ibrutinib (1 μM). A. Cholesterol and FPP production. Anti-IgM stimulation did not increase
cholesterol and FPP production in IGHV M and UM cells. IgM+ibrutinib significantly reduced the levels of cholesterol and FPP in IGHV
UM cells (*p = 0.04 and *p = 0.05, respectively). B. RhoA and RhoA kinase activity. Anti-IgM stimulation had no effect on RhoA-GTP
expression and RhoA kinase activity in IGHV M and UM cells. The amount of GTP-bound RhoA and the activity of the RhoA kinase were
significantly reduced by IgM+ibrutinib in IGHV UM cells (*p = 0.0015 and *p = 0.0021, respectively), but not in IGHV M cells. C. HIF-1α
activity and MDR1 expression. Anti-IgM stimulation did not increase HIF-1α activity and MDR1 expression in IGHV M and UM cells.
The activity of HIF-1α and MDR1 expression were significantly reduced by IgM+ibrutinib in IGHV UM cells (*p = 0.01 and *p = 0.0012,
respectively), but not in IGHV M cells. In all panels, bars represent mean values ± SEM of side-by-side experiments performed in replicates.

Unlike SIM, ZA was unable to increase Doxo
accumulation and Doxo-induced cytotoxicity in IGHV
UM cells cultured in the presence or in the absence of
M2–10B4 SCs (Supplementary Figure S7C, S7D).
To further elucidate the difference between ZA
and SIM, we also evaluated the effects on Akt and NFkB, which are well-known pro-survival factors for CLL
cells [22]. The baseline activity of Akt, but not that of NFkB, was significantly higher in IGHV UM than M cells
(p ≤0.001) (Figure 6A, 6B). The same results were
confirmed by evaluating the expression of the active
phosphorylated form of Akt and the nuclear translocation
of the NF-kB components p50 and p65 by western blot
analyses (Supplementary Figure S8A, S8B).
Akt activity was further upregulated by the presence
of M2–10B4 SCs (Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure
S9A), whereas NF-kB activity was not, as previously
reported [4]. ZA significantly increased Akt activity in
IGHV UM cells (p ≤ 0.009), and this effect was particularly
evident when ZA and SCs were used in combination (p
≤ 0.03) (Supplementary Figure S9A). Of note, ZA also
increased NF-kB activity in IGHV UM cells, both in the
absence and in the presence of SCs (p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.04,
respectively) (Supplementary Figure S9B). Unlike ZA, SIM

reduced the baseline Akt and NF-kB activities (p ≤ 0.02),
and significantly abrogated the SC-induced up-regulation
of Akt and NF-kB activity (p ≤ 0.03; Figure 6C, 6D), Akt
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S8C) and NF-kB
nuclear translocation (Supplementary Figure S8D).

Specific inhibitors of ERK1–2, RhoA kinase
and HIF-1α reverse the MDR phenotype of
IGHV UM cells
We also tested the activity of specific inhibitors
targeting ERK1–2 kinases (PD98059, PD), RhoA kinase
(Y27632, Y276) and HIF-1α (YC-1) in IGHV UM cells
cultured alone or in the presence of SCs. Of note, the three
inhibitors, as well as the upstream Mev pathway inhibitor
SIM, had no impact on SCs viability after 48 hours of
culture and did not increase the cytotoxic activity of Doxo
toward SCs (Supplementary Figure S10).
In IGHV UM CLL cells, PD and Y276 markedly
reduced HIF-1α phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure
S11). Moreover, PD, Y276 and YC-1 reduced HIF-1α
activity (Figure 7A) and MDR1 expression (Figure 7B),
and increased intracellular Doxo accumulation (p always
≤ 0.0048) (Figure 7C) and Doxo-mediated cytotoxicity

Figure 3: SCs upregulate the Mev pathway activity, the RhoA/RhoA kinase cascade and the HIF-1α/Pgp axis in IGHV
UM but not in IGHV M CLL cells. The production of cholesterol and FPP A. the amount of GTP-bound RhoA and the activity of the
RhoA kinase B. the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α and the expression of the MDR1 gene C. were higher in IGHV UM cells cultured for
24 hours with M2–10B4 SCs compared to IGHV UM cells cultured alone (*p always ≤ 0.002). SCs did not have a significant impact on the
activity of the Mev pathway and downstream molecules in IGHV M cells. In all panels, bars represent mean values ± SEM of side-by-side
experiments performed in replicates.

alone or in the presence of the murine stromal cell line M2–10B4, were exposed to 1 μM SIM. A. Cholesterol and FPP production. The
amount of cholesterol and FPP produced by IGHV UM cells was significantly increased after 24-hour co-culture with SCs (p = 0.007 and
p = 0.009, respectively). SIM significantly reduced the levels of cholesterol and FPP in IGHV UM cells both in the absence (p = 0.04 and
p = 0.05, respectively) and in the presence (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively) of M2–10B4 SCs. B. Ras and ERK1–2 kinase activity.
Co-culture with M2–10B4 SCs increased the levels of Ras-GTP and phospho-ERK1–2 kinase. SIM reduced the expression of the active

representative experiments (UPN, unique patient number). C. RhoA and RhoA kinase activity. Twenty four-hour co-culture with M2–10B4
SCs significantly increased the levels of expression of RhoA GTP and RhoA Kinase (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0024, respectively). The
expression of RhoA-GTP and RhoA kinase was significantly reduced by SIM, both in the absence (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively)
and in the presence (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) of SCs. In panels A and C results are from 8 side-by-side experiments. Box

Doxo extrusion and enhanced survival compared with
IGHV M cells. The MDR signature of IGHV UM cells is
at least partially dependent on BCR signaling, as shown
by the inhibitory effect exerted by ibrutinib on the Mev
pathway and Mev-regulated signaling.
The constitutive MDR features of IGHV UM cells
are further exacerbated by the incubation with SCs, which
stimulates the Mev pathway and its downstream signaling
cascades. Mev pathway manipulation with SIM, and
specific ERK1–2, RhoA kinase or HIF-1α inhibitors reset
the chemosensitivity of IGHV UM cells to the same levels
of IGHV M cells, and neutralize the MDR-enhancing
effect operated by SCs.
A role for MDR1 in CLL chemoresistance has
previously been suggested by the association of Pgp
expression with IGHV UM genes and poor prognosis
cytogenetics [23]. Our data confirm that the MDR1
gene, which is a primary transcriptional target of HIF-1α
[24, 25], is constitutively more expressed in IGHV UM
than in M cells. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription
factor composed of an oxygen-induced HIF-1α and a

(p ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 7D and Supplementary Figure S12–
S13) in IGHV UM cells, both in the absence and in the
presence of SCs.
These results provided the proof-in-principle that
inhibition of the Ras/ERK1–2/HIF-1α and RhoA/RhoA
kinase/HIF-1α cascades, and the down-regulation of
MDR1 gene expression and Pgp activity are mechanisms
exploited by SIM to restore the chemosensitivity of
MDR+ IGHV UM cells.

DISCUSSION
This study shows that IGHV UM cells are endowed
with a MDR phenotype which grants them a greater
resistance to Doxo-induced cytotoxicity compared with
IGHV M cells. Mechanistic insights have shown that
IGHV UM cells, according to their accelerated Mev
pathway activity [15], had significantly higher activity of
the Mev-regulated Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase
signaling cascades, increased HIF-1α phosphorylation
and activity, higher MDR1 gene expression, very effective

cytotoxicity. IGHV UM cells, cultured alone or in the presence of the murine stromal cell line M2–10B4, were exposed to 1 μM SIM.

A. HIF-1α activity. The activity of HIF-1α was significantly increased by 24-hour co-culture with M2–10B4 SCs (p = 0.0007). SIM
significantly reduced HIF-1α activity in IGHV UM cells, both in the absence (p = 0.003) and in the presence (p < 0.0001) of M2–10B4
SCs. B. MDR1 expression. Co-culture with M2–10B4 SCs significantly increased the levels of expression of MDR1 in IGHV UM cells (p
< 0.0001). After 24-hour exposure to SIM, a significant decrease in MDR1 expression was observed in IGHV UM cells, both in the absence
(p < 0.0001) and in the presence (p < 0.0001) of SCs. C. Doxo intracellular accumulation. The amount of intracellular Doxo in IGHV UM
cells was significantly reduced by co-culture with M2–10B4 SCs (p = 0.010). SIM significantly increased 48-hour Doxo accumulation in
IGHV UM cells cultured alone (p = 0.0026) or in the presence of SCs (p = 0.0002). D. Percentage of CD19+/CD5+ viable cells. IGHV
UM cells were exposed to 1 μM Doxo, 1 μM SIM, and the combination SIM+Doxo for 48 hours, both in the absence and in the presence
of M2–10B4 SCs. Cell viability was determined by Ann-V staining and cytofluorimetric analysis on CD19+/CD5+ cells. No decrease in
viability was observed when IGHV UM cells were exposed to SIM and Doxo used alone (91% ± 2% and 90% ± 1% of CD19+/CD5+
viable cells, respectively). By contrast, a significant reduction in cell viability was induced by the combination SIM+Doxo, both in the
absence (19, 5% ± 7% CD19+/CD5+ viable cells, p < 0.0001) and in the presence (10% ± 3% CD19+/CD5+ viable cells, p < 0.0001) of

constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit. During hypoxia,
HIF-1α is positively regulated by the activation of the
RhoA-dependent signaling cascade [16]. Under nonhypoxic conditions, the expression and transcriptional
activity of HIF-1α are regulated by growth factors and
cytokines through the activation of kinase pathways,
such as the Ras/ERK1–2 and the PI3k/Akt pathways
[17]. Unlike their normal counterparts, CLL cells express
HIF-1α even under normoxia [26], and its transcriptional
activity regulates CLL cells survival by inducing the
expression of growth factors, such as VEGF, and the
cytokines macrophage migration-inhibition factor (MIF)
and midkine [26–28]. This is the first report showing
that HIF-1α activity is significantly higher in IGHV UM
than in M cells, due to the higher activity of the upstream
Ras/ERK1–2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling cascades
in these cells. The MDR signature of IGHV UM cells is
partially dependent on their tonic BCR signaling, as shown
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by the inhibitory effect exerted by ibrutinib but the lack of
stimulatory effect exerted by anti-IgM.
Differently from anti-IgM-mediated BCR stimulation,
SCs exposure further increase the activity of Ras/ERK1–2
and RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling pathways and HIF-1α
in IGHV UM cells. As a result, the target gene MDR1 is
over-expressed, Doxo is more efficiently extruded and
IGHV UM cells are further protected from Doxo-induced
cytotoxicity. SCs are known to confer chemoresistance to
CLL cells. One of the main players of the SC-induced MDR
is the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, which is known to activate
the signal transducers ERK1–2 and Akt, and trigger LFA1
affinity to the integrin ICAM-1, through a RhoA-mediated
mechanism [29]. It is already known that the BCR signaling
modulates the activity of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, in fact
the blockade of the BCR signaling with a BTK inhibitor
decreases the migration of CXCR4-expressing CLL cells
toward CXCL12 produced by SCs [30].

Figure 6: SIM effectively counteracts SC-induced Akt upregulation in IGHV UM cells. IGHV UM cells had constitutive

higher levels of Akt activity (p < 0.001) compared to IGHV M cells A. By contrast, there was no difference in baseline NF-kB activity
between IGHV M and UM cells B. The Akt activity was further upregulated by the co-culture of IGHV UM cells with M2–10B4 SCs
(p < 0.0001). SIM reduced baseline levels of Akt activity (p = 0.0082), and significantly counteracted SC-induced Akt upregulation
(p = 0.0004) C. NF-kB activity was not upregulated by SCs, but it was significantly reduced by SIM exposure, both in the absence (p = 0.02)
or presence of SCs (p = 0.034) D. In panels A and B bars represent mean values ± SEM. In panels C and D results are from 8 side-by-side
experiments, and box and whiskers plot represent median values, first and third quartiles, and minimum and maximum values for each

The Mev pathway and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis
may reciprocally affect their activity, as shown by at least
two observations: 1) for optimal signaling CXCR4 must be
incorporated into membrane lipid rafts, whose formation
require membrane cholesterol, and which orchestrate the
interaction of the small GTPases Rac and Rho with their
downstream transducers [31]; 2) hypercholesterolemia
induces the secretion of CXCL12 and drives the migration
of CD19+/CXCR4+ B lymphocytes from the bone marrow
to the peripheral blood by interfering with the CXCL12/
CXCR4 axis [32]. Further studies aiming at elucidating the
connections between the Mev pathway and the CXCL12/
CXCR4 axis in CLL are currently ongoing in our laboratory.
Statins and aminobisphosphonates, by targeting
key enzymes in the Mev pathway, cause the intracellular
deprivation of isoprenoid moieties such as FPP and
GGPP, thus preventing Ras and RhoA prenylation and the
activation of their downstream signaling pathways [33].
We have recently reported that ZA effectively interrupts
Ras- and RhoA-dependent downstream signalling
pathways, abrogates Pgp expression, and restores Doxoinduced cytotoxicity in MDR+ human cancer cell lines
derived from solid tumors [14]. In CLL, ZA was not an
ideal chemosensitizing agent since it inhibited Ras/ERK1–
2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling pathways, HIF-1α
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity, and MDR1 expression, but did not increase Doxoinduced cytotoxicity. By contrast, SIM was effective in
reversing the resistance of IGHV UM cells to Doxo, also
in the presence of the protective effect exerted by SCs.
This different efficacy was due to a stronger ability of SIM
to increase the intracellular amount of Doxo, especially in
the presence of SCs, but also to a differential regulatory
effect exerted by the two compounds on the pro-survival
factors Akt and NF-kB. We have already reported
that ZA induces the activation of NF-kB in tumorassociated macrophages, reverting their phenotype from
tumor-permissive into tumoricidal cells [34]. A similar
upregulation of the Akt/NF-kB pathway was observed in
IGHV UM cells after ZA, but not after SIM exposure. This
at least partially accounted for a ZA-mediated pro-survival
activity which most likely prevailed on the death signals
triggered by Doxo.
Among the chemo-sensitizing agents that we have
tested, statins are the best candidate for clinical translation,
since they are commonly used in the clinical practice as
cholesterol-lowering agents. Previous data have shown that
SIM, although potently effective in blocking the proliferation
and inducing apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro [35–37], is not
capable of significantly reducing the tumor burden when
administered as a single agent in previously untreated

Figure 7: Specific inhibitors of RhoA, ERK1–2 and HIF-1α effectively reverse the MDR phenotype of IGHV UM
cells. IGHV UM cells were left untreated or treated with the ERK1–2 kinase inhibitor PD (10 μM), the RhoA kinase inhibitor Y276 (10

μM) and the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 (10 μM), both in the absence and in the presence of M2–10B4 SCs. A. HIF-1α activity. Co-culture with
M2–10B4 SCs significantly increased the activity of HIF-1α (p = 0.0014). PD, Y276 and YC-1 significantly reduced the activity of HIF1α in IGHV UM cells after 24 hours of culture, both in the absence (p always ≤ 0.0048) and in the presence (p always ≤ 0.0052) of SCs.
B. MDR1 expression. Twenty four-hour co-culture with M2–10B4 SCs significantly increased the expression of MDR1 in IGHV UM cells
(p < 0, 0001). After PD, Y276 and YC-1 treatment a significant decrease in MDR1 expression was observed in IGHV UM cells cultured
alone (p always ≤ 0.001) and in the presence of SCs (p always ≤ 0.0001). C. Doxo intracellular accumulation. Intracellular Doxo was
significantly lower in IGHV UM cells cultured with SCs than in IGHV UM cells cultured alone (p = 0.02). After 48-hour exposure to PD,
Y276 and YC-1, Doxo accumulation was significantly increased, both in the absence (p always ≤ 0.003) and in the presence of M2–10B4
SCs (p always ≤ 0.0012). D. Percentage of CD19+/CD5+ viable cells. IGHV UM cells were exposed to 1 μM Doxo, used alone and in
combination with each inhibitor (i.e. PD+Doxo, Y276+Doxo, YC-1+Doxo), both in the absence and in the presence of the M2–10B4 SCs.
Cell viability was determined by Ann-V staining and cytofluorimetric analysis on CD19+/CD5+ cells after 48-hours of culture. Doxo alone,
as well as the three inhibitors used as single agents, did not induce a decrease in cell viability. By contrast, the combinations PD+Doxo,
Y276+Doxo and YC-1+Doxo significantly reduced the viability of IGHV UM cells both in the absence and in the presence (p always <
0.0001) of SCs. In panels A–D results are from 7 side-by-side experiments. Box and whiskers plot represent median values, first and third
quartiles, and minimum and maximum values for each dataset.

CLL patients [37]. By contrast, statins effectively increase
the susceptibility of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant
CLL and lymphoma cells to dexamethasone and cytotoxic
drugs [38], even synergizing with purine analogs to induce
apoptosis of CLL cells [35]. Schmidmaier et al. have already
reported that the Mev pathway and the downstream RhoA/
RhoA kinase signaling pathway mediate SC-induced MDR,
and that targeting of this pathway by SIM may improve
the efficacy of anti-myeloma therapies by reduction of SCinduced MDR [39]. The same authors showed in a phase II
clinical trial that SIM could overcome MDR in refractory
myeloma receiving chemotherapy with bortezomib or
bendamustine [40]. In the CLL setting, Chae et al. recently
reported data on a retrospective analysis showing that
the use of statin and aspirin is associated with improved
outcome in CLL patients receiving salvage fludarabine,
cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) chemotherapy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[41], providing the rationale for a prospective study aimed
at evaluating the effects of statins in CLL patients receiving
chemoimmunotherapy. Since none of the drugs included in
the FCR regimen are substrates of the Pgp, further studies
aimed at determining the role and mechanism of action of
statins in chemo-sensitizing CLL cells are warranted.
Doxo accumulation as a read-out assay to test Pgp
activity could be considered a limitation of our study, due
to previous data showing that the addition of anthracyclines
to alkylating agents did not improve the clinical outcome of
CLL patients [8]. More recently, however, the addition of
mitoxantrone or epirubicine to fludarabine-based regimens
has been shown to improve response rates [42–44]. Skribek
et al. have reported that anthracyclines can have direct
cytotoxic effects on CLL cells in vitro irrespectively to
age, clinical stage or cytogenetic markers like del(17p)
[45]. These observations and our data are strong incentives
29841

Oncotarget

to reconsider the therapeutic potential of anthracyclines in
CLL, especially when used in combination with chemosensitizing agents targeting the Mev pathway such as
statins, to treat specific subsets of high-risk CLL patients
(e.g. IGHV UM patients). Moreover, the chemo-sensitizing
effects that we observed by targeting ERK1–2 and RhoA
kinase, as well as the transcription factor HIF-1α, in
addition to providing a confirmatory evidence about the
mechanistic role played by these pathways in the MDR+
phenotype of IGHV UM cells, opens new perspectives on
innovative targets amenable to therapeutic interventions.
Interestingly, recent data have shown that Pgp may
be involved in the decreased anti-cancer efficiency and
modified pharmacological properties of novel targeted
agents, such as imatinib [46] and second-generation
tyrosine kinase inhibitors [47]. Therefore, the study of Pgp
activity and its modulation might have a broad impact in
the current era of targeted therapies, providing important
information on the pharmacokinetic and the anti-cancer
effects of these novel agents.

SIM and Y276 were purchased from Calbiochem (San
Diego, CA, USA). When not otherwise specified, all the
other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

Culture and co-culture conditions
CLL cells were cultured in 24-well plates (Costar,
Cambridge, MA, USA) (106 cells/well) at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 humidified incubator. The standard culture medium
was RPMI 1640 (Euroclone, Milano, Italy) supplemented
with 10% FCS (Euroclone), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
For co-culture experiments, the M2–10B4 murine
SCs were harvested through Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich,
Milano, Italy) digestion and plated (150 × 103 cells/well)
in complete culture medium for 24 hours. CLL cells (1 ×
106 cells/well) were added to the culture the following day.
In selected experiments, IGHV M and UM CLL cells were
exposed to ZA 1 μM, SIM 1 μM, ERK1–2 kinase inhibitor
PD 10 μM, HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 10 μM, RhoA kinase
inhibitor Y276 10 μM, in the absence and in the presence
of Doxo 1 μM. In selected experiments, CLL cells (5 × 106
cells/well) were pre-incubated in complete RPMI medium
with or without ibrutinib (1 μM) for 30 minutes at 37°C,
and then stimulated for 24 hours with 10 μg/well antiIgM polyclonal goat F(ab’)2 (Southern Biotechnologies
Birmingham, AL, USA) immobilized on 24-wells plates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected
from 63 untreated CLL patients between March 2008
and November 2012 after informed consent. Patient
demographics and clinical characteristics are reported in
Supplementary Table S1. CLL was defined by clinical
examination, PB cell count and immunophenotypic
criteria. Tumor IGHV rearrangements were amplified
starting from genomic DNA and sequences with deviations
of < 2% or ≥ 2% from the germline IGHV sequence were
considered IGHV UM or M as previously reported [48].

Mev pathway activity
After 24 hours of culture, 1 × 106 CLL cells were
incubated for another 24 hours with 1 μCi of [3H]acetate
(3600 mCi/mmol; Amersham International, Piscataway,
NJ, USA) to measure the intracellular synthesis of
cholesterol and FPP. Lipids were extracted in methanol/
hexane, resolved by thin layer chromatography and
quantified by liquid scintillation counting as reported
in [15]. According to the titration curve, the results are
expressed as fmol/1 × 106 cells.

Cell purification and cell lines
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
IGHV M and UM patients were isolated from fresh samples
by density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Histopaque, PAA
Laboratories GmbH, Linz, Austria). PBMC were used
without further manipulation when they contained more
than 90% of CLL cells (CD19+/CD5+). When CLL cells
were ≤ 90% they were purified by negative selection using
a Magnetic Bead-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS®) with a
B Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, Bologna, Italy).
In selected experiments, the murine marrow-derived
stromal cell line M2–10B4 (ATCC # CRL-1972) was used.

Ras and RhoA activity
To evaluate Ras and RhoA activity, their GTP-bound
fraction, taken as an index of the G-protein activation [49],
was measured after 24 hours of culture. Ras-GTP was detected
in a pull-down assay as previously reported [50]; RhoA-GTP
binding was measured with the G-LISA RhoA Activation
Assay Biochem Kit (Cytoskeleton Inc, Denver, CO, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each set
of experiments a titration curve was prepared using serial
dilution of the RhoA-GTP positive control of the kit. Data are
expressed as U absorbance/mg cell proteins (U mg/prot).

Chemicals
Electrophoresis reagents were obtained from BioRad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA). The protein
content of cell lysates was assessed with the bicinchoninic
acid kit from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO, USA).
ZA was a kind gift from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland).

RhoA kinase activity
RhoA kinase activity was measured after 24 hours of
culture on 2 × 106 cells with the CycLex Rho Kinase Assay
29842

Oncotarget

Kit (CycLex Co., Nagano, Japan), as already described
[50]. For each set of experiments a titration curve was set
using serial dilution of recombinant RhoA kinase (Rock2,
MBL Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Data are expressed as U
absorbance/mg cell proteins (U mg/prot).

was performed comparing the MDR1 PCR product with the
GAPDH product, used as a housekeeping gene, with the
Bio-Rad Software Gene Expression Quantitation (Bio-Rad).

Western blot (WB)

NF-kB activity was measured on 10 μg nuclear
extracts using the TransAM Flexi NF-kB Family assay
kit (Active Motif), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To assess the procedure specificity, a
competition assay was performed by adding an excess
(20 pmol) of the probe containing the NF-kB consensus
sequence to the positive control nuclear extracts provided
by the kit.
Akt activity was measured on 2 × 106 cells with the
CycLex Akt/PKB Kinase Assay/Inhibitor screening kit
(CycLex Co.) in 96-well plates pre-coated with the Akt
substrate AkTide-2T, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The titration curve was prepared using serial
dilutions of recombinant Akt (CycLex Co.).
NF-kB and Akt activity are expressed as U
absorbance/mg cell proteins (U mg/prot).

NF-kB and Akt activity

After 24 hours of culture 2 × 106 cells were lysed
in MLB buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, 750 mM NaCl, 1%
v/v NP40, 10% v/v glycerol, 50 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
EDTA, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin,
10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5), sonicated
(with two bursts of 10 s; Labsonic sonicator, Sartorius
Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne Cedex, France), and
centrifuged at 13000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Ten μg cell
lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride membrane sheets (Immobilon-P,
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and probed with the
following antibodies: anti phospho-(Thr202/Tyr204,
Thr185/Tyr187)-ERK1–2 (Millipore); anti-ERK1–2
(Millipore); anti-phospho-(Ser473)-Akt (Millipore);
anti-Akt (Millipore); anti- glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH, used as control of equal protein
loading; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), followed by the secondary peroxidase-conjugated
antibodies (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).

Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation
To evaluate the activity of Pgp the intracellular
accumulation of the Pgp substrate Doxo was measured.
To this aim, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with 1 μM Doxo
cultured alone or in presence of inhibitors for 48 hours;
intracellular Doxo was measured spectrofluorimetrically, at
excitation and emission wavelengths of 475 and 553 nm, as
reported earlier [50]. A blank was prepared in the absence
of cells in each set of experiments, and its fluorescence was
subtracted from that measured in each sample. Fluorescence
was converted in nmol Doxo/mg cell proteins (nmol/mg
prot) using a previously prepared calibration curve.

HIF-1α activity
Nuclear proteins from 2 × 106 cells were extracted
after 24-hour culture using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active
Motif, Rixensart, Belgium), and quantified. The activity
of HIF-1α was assessed on 10 μg nuclear extracts using
the TransAM™ HIF-1α Transcription Factor Assay Kit
(Active Motif), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
To assess the procedure specificity, a competition assay
was performed by adding an excess (20 pmol) of HIF-1α
consensus oligonucleotide to nuclear extracts derived from
CLL cells. Data are expressed as U absorbance/mg cell
proteins (U mg/prot).

Quantification of apoptotic and viable cells
After 48 hours of culture, cells were harvested,
washed in PBS and stained with anti-CD19 PerCP
(Beckman Coulter, Milano, Italy) and anti-CD5 APC
(Dako SpA, Milano, Italy) monoclonal antibodies.
The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by
Annexin-V (Ann-V) staining with the MEBCYTOApoptosis Kit (MBL Medical and Biological Laboratories,
Naka-ku Nagoya, Japan). Flow cytometry was performed
with a FACSCalibur and CELLQuest software (Becton
Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA).

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
After 24 hours of ex vivo culture, total RNA was
extracted from 1 × 106 cells and reverse-transcribed
using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RT-PCR was carried
out using IQ− SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
sequences of MDR1 primers were 5′-TGCTGGAGCGG
TTCTACG-3′, 5′-ATAGGCAATGTTCTCAGCAATG-3′.
The sequences of GAPDH primers were 5′-GA
AGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′,
5′-CATGGTGGAAT
CATATTGGAA-3′. The relative expression of each sample

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the SigmaStat
3.5 software (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and
with GraphPad Prism version 5.01 for Windows (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). All datasets were evaluated
with a normality test: data with Gaussian or approximately
