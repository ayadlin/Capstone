BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to report the rates of disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and
overall survival after low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy (PB). METHODS. Data from 1006 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who received LDR-PB and underwent implantation on or before October 23, 2003 were extracted from a prospective
database on November 11, 2011. The selected patients had low-risk (58%) or intermediate-risk (42%) disease according to National
Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. The Phoenix threshold was used to define biochemical relapse. Sixty-five percent of patients
received 3 months of neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and 3 months of concomitant ADT. Univariate and multivariate analyses are reported in relation to patient, tumor, and treatment variables. RESULTS. The median follow-up was 7.5 years. By
using Fine and Gray competing risks analysis, the 5-year and 10-year actuarial DFS rates were 96.7% (95% confidence interval, 95.2%97.7%) and 94.1% (95% confidence interval, 92%-95.6%), respectively. When applied to the whole cohort, none of the usual prognostic
variables, including dose metrics, were correlated with DFS. However, in both univariate and multivariate models, increasing dose was
the only covariate that correlated with improved DFS for the subset of men (N ¼ 348) who did not receive ADT (P ¼ .043). The actuarial 10-year CSS rate was 99.1% (95% confidence interval, 97.3%-99.7%). The overall survival rate was 93.8% at 5 years (95% confidence
interval, 92%-95.1%) and 83.5% at 10 years (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-86.6%). Only age at implantation (P ¼ .0001) was correlated with overall survival in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS. In a consecutive cohort of 1006 men with National Comprehensive
Cancer Network low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, the actuarial rate of recurrent disease after LDR-PB was approxiC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Comparative health outcomes research can help inform public debate, as well as individual decision makers, by revealing
the real-world utility of medical interventions; however, it requires large sample sizes, adequate follow-up, and patients
whose demographics and pretreatment prognostic factors are known and relevant to those at risk.1 Comprehensive population-based outcomes databases are ideal resources for this type of research. Herein, we describe the results from such a
database in which patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated in a universal access, publicly
funded, low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy (PB) program founded in 1997 by radiation oncologists and medical
physicists at the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA).
The BCCA LDR-PB program is provincial in scope, with multiple practitioners working in 5 regional cancer centers
using uniform, but evolving, evidence-based eligibility criteria and treatment protocols based on the Seattle ‘‘preplan’’
experience combined with a manual planning algorithm that was developed in-house. From its onset, the program

incorporated comprehensive prospective data entry, conducted regular peer-review and quality-assurance activities, and later developed formal training and certification
procedures.2
In a previous article,3 we presented the disease-free
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) endpoints for the
same cohort. Although excellent outcomes were reported
in that study, the median follow-up was relatively short at
4.5 years from the date of implantation. In this update,
the median follow-up was 7.5 years (maximum, 13 years).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Treatment Protocol

The BCCA PB database contains patient, tumor, treatment, and outcomes data on more than 4000 consecutive
LDR-PB implantations. The current analysis consists of
all patients who received LDR-PB on or before October
23, 2003 (N ¼ 1006). All patients received 0.424 U iodine-125 (NIST99, model 6711; Oncura, Arlington
Heights, Ill) prescribed to 144 gray (Gy) as a minimum
peripheral dose. RAPIDStrand (Oncura) was used for all
peripheral needles, incorporating the majority of seeds
(>85%) in 679 of implantations (67.5%); the remainder
employed exclusively loose sources, a practice that was discontinued after 361 implantations. No patients received
supplemental external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT).
Although 42% of this cohort had intermediate-risk
disease according to National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) stratification guidelines, at the time
these implantations were performed, our eligibility
criteria excluded men with pretreatment prostate-specific
antigen (iPSA) levels >15 ng/mL as well as men with
both an iPSA >10 ng/mL and a Gleason sum of 7.
Moreover, all men with either a Gleason sum of 7 or an
iPSA >10 ng/mL received 3 months of neoadjuvant
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and 3 months of
concomitant ADT, as previously described.3,4 In
addition, 272 of 586 low-risk patients (46.4%) received
the same regimen of ADT either for size reduction or
because they had started on ADT before referral to
radiation oncology. For the sake of consistency, when possible, the latter group received the same regimen of
neoadjuvant and concomitant ADT.
Follow-Up

All patients were offered cancer center-based follow-up
with clinic visits at 6 weeks, every 6 months for 4 or 5
years, and every 12 to 24 months thereafter. Nevertheless,
according to protocol, PSA and testosterone values continued to be measured and recorded every 6 months.

Defining Oncologic Endpoints

The ‘‘nadir þ 2 ng/mL’’ PSA threshold (Phoenix definition) was use to define biochemical relapse. DFS was
defined as the absence of biochemical, clinical, histologic,
or imaging evidence of recurrent or persistent prostate
cancer and not having received any secondary treatment
for prostate cancer at any time after implantation. Like in
our previous reports, patients with early rises in PSA (PSA
‘‘bounces’’) that triggered the Phoenix definition were not
considered relapses in the final analysis if subsequent PSA
values declined to <0.5 ng/mL without intervention.3,4
Mortality data were derived from the provincial
death registry. Patients who died were scored as ‘‘dead of/
with disease’’ (DO/WD) if they were not disease-free (as
defined above) on the date of death regardless of the
cause(s) of death listed in the registry. Note that all deaths
that were categorized as DO/WD were recorded as events
in estimating cause-specific survival (CSS); this method of
scoring CSS tends to overestimate cause-specific mortality, but it insures that disease-related mortality is not
underestimated. Patients who died and were considered
‘‘disease-free’’ (as defined above) at the time of death were
scored ‘‘dead no evidence of disease’’ (DNED) and were
censored at date of death for actuarial analyses of DFS and
CSS.
Univariate and Multivariate Analyses

Actuarial DFS and CSS rates and their respective 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the competing risks method of Fine and Gray.5 Actuarial rates of
OS ware estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
The Fine and Gray method5 also was used in univariate analysis for DFS. The following variables were included:
patient age at implantation, NCCN risk group, Gleason
sum, iPSA (with log10 transform to obtain a more Gaussian
distribution of iPSA values), receipt of ADT, clinical stage,
the percentage of positive cores (PPC), the consecutive
order of implantation, the minimum dose received by 90%
of the postimplantation prostate volume (D90), and the
percentage of the postimplantation prostate volume that
received 144 Gy (V100).
A multivariate Fine and Gray model (backward:conditional) was used for DFS. The model included the following categorical variables: receipt of ADT, Gleason
sum, clinical stage, and the following continuous variables: age at implantation, consecutive implantation number, log10 iPSA, PPC, and D90 or V100 (the dose metrics
were tested separately, because they are strongly correlated). For OS, multivariate analysis using a Cox model
(backward:conditional) included the same variables with

statistical package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; available at: http://www.r-project.

RESULTS
Disease-Free Survival

Forty-nine men (4.9%) have developed recurrent disease,
resulting in actuarial DFS estimates of 96.7% at 5 years
(95% CI, 95.2%-97.7%) and 94.1% at 10 years (95%
CI, 92%-95.6%) (Table 1, Fig. 1). At the time of data
extraction, the median follow-up was 7.5 years; 392 men
(39%) had been followed for 8 years, and 145 men
(14%) had been followed for 10 years. With 1 exception
(see Patterns of Failure, below), all patients who developed clinical, pathologic, or imaging evidence of recurrent
cancer also had antecedent or simultaneous biochemical
recurrence using the Phoenix definition. It is noteworthy
that post-treatment PSA values were exceptionally low by
EBRT standards; for example, at follow-up times 96
months, the median PSA for nonrelapsing patients was
0.02 ng/mL (mean, 0.05 ng/mL; range, 0.01-0.3 ng/mL).

had the same actuarial DFS as the non-ADT subgroup (P
¼ .550), as illustrated in Figure 2.
Analyzing the entire cohort, none of the prognostic
variables entered in the univariate or multivariate models
were predictive of DFS, although log iPSA had a strong
trend (P ¼ .057) (Table 3). However, when the analysis
was restricted to the non-ADT subgroup, decreasing
V100 and D90 values were each predictive of an increased
risk of disease recurrence in both univariate and multivariate models (P ¼ .043) (Table 3).
To further explore the dose response, D90 cutoff
points of 130 Gy, 140 Gy, 150 Gy, 160 Gy, 170 Gy, and
180 Gy were tested using a Fine and Gray competing risks
analysis. In the non-ADT subgroup, all of the tested dose
cutoff points demonstrated trends that correlated
increased D90 values with improved DFS, but none
reached statistical significance. The lowest P value (P ¼
.1200) was observed using a cutoff point of 130 Gy (see
Fig. 3a). No significant or nonsignificant trends were
observed linking D90 to DFS for the ADT subset or the
entire cohort. Figure 3b illustrates the Fine and Gray analysis of the ADT subgroup using a D90 cutoff point of
130 Gy (P ¼ .9100).

average of 4.2 years older at the time of implantation
(69.1 years) than the patients who remained alive (64.9

log iPSA (P ¼ .0282) was added to age at implantation (P

were significant for OS in the non-ADT subgroup in univariate or multivariate models. Similar to our previous
studies,3,4 we did not detect a statistically significant correlation linking protocol ADT and differences in all-cause
mortality (see Table 5, Fig. 4).
Patterns of Failure

The site of first recurrence was established in 19 of 49
patients, including 8 who had clinical and/or histologic
evidence of local relapse and 11 who had lymph node or
distant metastatic relapse. The site of first recurrence was
unknown in 30 patients who had biochemical relapse
(61%), and all 30 had a normal digital rectal examination
and either a normal postimplantation biopsy (N ¼ 12) or
no biopsy (N ¼ 18, including 7 who also had no imaging
studies). One individual underwent transurethral prostatic resection (TUPR) to relieve a stricture >10 years
postimplantation, and the operative specimen revealed
persistent/recurrent prostate cancer. Before the TUPR,
that patient’s PSA was unusually high at 0.83 ng/mL, but
it was well short of triggering the Phoenix threshold, and
recurrent cancer was not suspected preoperatively.
Follow-Up and Frequency of Prostate-Specific
Antigen Measurement

Overall compliance with follow-up has been excellent.
Only 20 patients (2%) had no follow-up PSA values availCancer

able, and the median number of postimplantation PSA
values was 11 (mean  standard deviation, 10.6  4.5
PSA values; range, 1-36 PSA values). Figure 5 compares
the actual number of postimplantation PSA values with
the expected number if compliance with institutional protocol (every 6 months) had been perfect. By 5 years of follow-up, the expected number of PSA values is 10, and an
average of 8 values were recorded. Compliance diminished somewhat with length follow-up, such that, by 10
years, an average of 14 PSA values per patient were
recorded, whereas the expected number is 20 PSA values.
Compared with disease-free patients, relapsed
patients have disproportionately numerous follow-up
PSA values as a result of surveillance bias, whereby
patients who have postimplantation PSA values that
appear worrisome for recurrence tend to experience a
sharply increased frequency of PSA measurements, and
those with established relapse often have frequent PSA
measurements to monitor the effects of secondary treatment. For these reasons patients with relapse were
excluded from this part of the analysis.
DISCUSSION
The current data are unusual in presenting a consecutive
cohort of uniformly treated men who received LDR-PB
in a universal access, nonfee-for-service model of health
care delivery. Most important, the data demonstrate excellent rates of DFS at 5 years and 10 years and unusually
low follow-up PSA values among nonrelapsing patients,
suggesting that long-term outcomes will be similar to the
10-year results and those reported by Seattle, which now

has follow-up exceeding 15 years.6 However, these observations lead to other questions.
Was Treatment Necessary?

No single-arm study can hope to answer this question,
but it is worth exploring its implications. In this cohort,
the crude rate of disease recurrence was 4.9% at a median
follow-up of 7.5 years, and the actuarial estimate of disease recurrence at 10 years was just 5.9%. Given these low
rates after a relatively long follow-up, we conclude that
the patients in this cohort had a very low (<5%) incidence
of occult lymph node or distant metastatic disease before
implantation. In this sense, the patients were well selected
to benefit from effective local therapy. Conversely, it
seems increasingly unlikely that early radical intervention
1542

improves OS for men with favorable-risk prostate cancer,7
and new strategies are emerging based on active surveillance or on focal therapies that promise less treatmentrelated morbidity.8,9
Although new approaches and changes are welcome
in oncology, men seeking guidance today need reliable
benchmarks for conventional therapies by which to judge
variations and alternatives. Therefore, we contend that the
results of this cohort are relevant to newly diagnosed
patients and to practitioners who provide therapy advice
in today’s era of widespread PSA screening. It is noteworthy that only 30% of this cohort would have been eligible
for active surveillance using contemporary criteria established by the international Prostate Cancer Research
International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol.10
Their median age was 66 years; and, with rare exceptions,
operating room protocol restricted implantation recipients to those with American Society of Anesthesiologists
risk class 1 and class 2 disease; this careful selection has
resulted in a median survival that is predicted to exceed 20
years from the date of implantation. Furthermore, 24% of
patients in the cohort had a Gleason sum of 7, 14% had
an iPSA >10 ng/mL, 55% had T2 disease, and 27% had
50% positive cores (Table 2). Therefore, it is reasonable
to speculate that some men in this cohort may have been
spared metastatic disease along with the associated need
for prolonged systemic therapy or potentially morbid radical salvage procedures after less effective forms of local
therapy.
Are Biochemical Endpoints Appropriate?

Because most recurrence events in this cohort (61%) were
defined by biochemical parameters only, this is a relevant
question. In our view, biochemical endpoints are reliable
surrogates for disease recurrence provided the data are
derived from large samples with regular PSA testing and
long post-treatment follow-up. Furthermore, the Phoenix
definition provides a multiply validated failure endpoint
that is correlated with diminished OS in both intermediate-risk and high-risk patients11 after EBRT. The current
study also confirms the sensitivity of the Phoenix definition, because there was only 1 patient with a known clinical or pathologic cancer recurrence in this cohort who did
not also trigger the Phoenix definition of biochemical recurrence (see Patterns of Failure, above).
Why Are None of the Typical Prognostic
Variables Significant?

In our previous reports,3,4 receipt of ADT and iPSA were
predictive of DFS in multivariate analysis, but neither of
these prognostic variables reached statistical significance

in the updated univariate and multivariate models. In
contrast, this update confirms our previously reported3,4
lack of an obvious dose response for the widely accepted
whole prostate dose metrics D90 and V100. The absence
of an apparent dose response probably is explained by the
existence of a threshold dose above which local tumor
eradication is almost certain. Apparently, as discussed in
detail in a previous report,12 this threshold dose is not well
captured by the traditional dose metrics D90 and V100
when applied to our data set, which can be explained in
part by 4 factors: 1) the consistent receipt of neoadjuvant
and concomitant ADT by all patients with a Gleason sum
of 7 or an iPSA >10 ng/mL; 2) relatively uniform, highquality implants from the onset of the program (just 13%
of all implantations in this cohort had D90 values <130
Gy; data not shown); 3) a planning philosophy that delivers a confluent 150% prescription dose to the periphery of
the prostate; and 4) the deliberate use of extraprostatic
seeds to provide dose coverage beyond the prostate
boundary without increasing the central dose.12
What Is the Role of Androgen-Deprivation
Therapy?

The value of ADT for high-risk disease is established13;
however the use, duration, and timing of ADT in men
with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease remain controversial.14,15 At the time our initial protocol was developed (1997), the purported value of adjuvant ADT was in
ascendancy, and clinicians were skeptical about the efficacy of LDR-PB, particularly in men with intermediaterisk disease. Accordingly, mandatory, short-course ADT
was built into our protocol, and nearly 66% of the men in
1544

Figure 5. This scatter plot illustrates the number of follow-up
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values as a function of time
since implantation. The dashed line indicates the expected
number of PSA values if compliance with protocol-specified
frequency (every 6 months) had been perfect. The solid trend
line is fitted to the actual data.

this cohort received it, including all those with a Gleason
sum of 7 or an iPSA >10 ng/mL (Table 2). Consequently,
this cohort has no meaningful comparison group of intermediate-risk patients without ADT, because only 3% of
intermediate-risk patients did not receive ADT (Table 2).
Recognizing this important limitation, the data presented
here suggests that the use of protocol ADT may have
improved the DFS outcomes by partially compensating
for dose deficiencies, because increasing D90 and V100
were only predictive of improved DFS in the non-ADT
subgroup (see Table 3, Fig. 3a,b). It is interesting to note
that the use of protocol ADT in this population has not
resulted in a significant decrement in OS that some studies have reported.16 Note that our LDR-PB program discontinued mandatory ADT as of February 2005;
therefore, future analyses of larger data sets will provide an
opportunity to explore the therapeutic value of shortcourse ADT when combined with LDR-PB as well as the
long-term effect of short-term ADT on OS.
Is Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy the
Gold Standard for Radiation Therapy?

By using matched pair analysis, we previously demonstrated that LDR-PB is much more effective than standard-dose EBRT (median dose, 68 Gy), although it carries
no greater risk of serious complications.17 Comparisons
with the literature suggest that PB also is more effective
than dose-escalated EBRT.18 Finally, the success of a local
therapy must be judged by its inverse: namely, local failure. Unless the false-negative rate is very high in
Cancer

Prostate Brachytherapy 10-Year Outcomes/Morris et al

postimplantation biopsies, our results suggest that the rate
of local persistent/recurrent disease in this cohort must be
less than 3% and possibly much less than 3% (see Patterns
of Failure, above).
However, these results need to be interpreted with
caution, because they apply only to a specific subtype of
permanent LDR-PB and may or may not generalize to
other brachytherapy techniques and protocols, which
comprise a broad menu. Furthermore, oncologic outcomes, even confining comparisons to patients who
receive iodine-125 LDR-PB, appear to vary substantially
among centers.19-26
Can These Results Be Compared With Surgery?

Ideally, we would either compare these data with population-based DFS after radical prostatectomy in clinically
staged patients, or there would be adequately powered
randomized trials to address the issue of which treatment
provides the best disease control. Unfortunately, such
data do not exist. The single published randomized trial
comparing LDR-PB with radical prostatectomy27
included only 200 men and produced equivalent results
in terms of DFS at 5 years, although a somewhat greater
incidence of adverse effects after radical prostatectomy
was reported. A recent systematic literature review of biochemical outcomes suggests that LDR-PB may be more
effective than surgery in terms of biochemical
endpoints.28
Surgery and radiotherapy tend to use different definitions of biochemical relapse, which compromises comparison. But this is not always the case. In a previous
study,29 using a >0.4-ng/mL threshold for both interventions, we demonstrated that the actual biochemical relapse
rate after LDR-PB in a large, consecutive cohort treated at
BCCA was only half that predicted by the widely used
Kattan nomogram if the same men had undergone surgery by experienced surgeons operating in high-volume
centers (7% vs 13% actuarial at 5 years; P < .003).
Shortcomings of the Current Study

During the era in which these men received treatment,
only NCCN low-risk and selected (so-called ‘‘low-tier’’)
intermediate-risk patients were eligible for LDR-PB by
BCCA policy, as mentioned above. ‘‘High-tier’’ intermediate-risk patients only became eligible outside of a trial
setting in February 2009. We expect that this high-tier
subgroup will experience more distant recurrence events
after brachytherapy, but the effect on local control, in our
opinion, is less predictable.
Despite its status as a population-based, consecutive
cohort, our study carries some of the limitations of singleCancer

institution series, in that patients are not necessarily representative of other regions in which differences in population risk profile, comorbidities, Gleason scoring, and
screening behavior may influence outcomes as much or
more than treatment. Finally, the adverse effects of prostate cancer treatment are vitally important in treatment
recommendations. In terms of prevalence and incidence,
the treatment-related toxicity in the BCCA LDR-PB program has been comparable to that reported by other centers for urinary bladder, lower bowel, and erectile
function.30-33
In conclusion, these population-based data provide
credible evidence that LDR-PB is capable of delivering
unsurpassed DFS and local control for the risk strata
examined when used as a single modality or in combination with short-course ADT. It is perhaps noteworthy that
these results were achieved in a nonfee-for-service, universal access medical environment in which multiple practitioners receive specific training; adhere to consistent,
evidence-based eligibility criteria; and apply uniform, but
evolving, treatment protocols and planning algorithms.
