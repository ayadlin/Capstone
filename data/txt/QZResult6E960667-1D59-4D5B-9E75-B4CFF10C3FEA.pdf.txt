Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In cancer cells, genetic alterations can activate proto-oncogenes, thereby contributing to
tumorigenesis. However, the protein products of oncogenes are sometimes over-expressed without
alteration of the proto-oncogene. Helping to explain this phenomenon, we found that when compared
to similarly proliferating non-transformed cell lines, cancer cell lines often expressed substantial
amounts of mRNA isoforms with shorter 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). These shorter isoforms
usually resulted from alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). The APA had functional
consequences, with the shorter mRNA isoforms exhibiting increased stability and typically
producing ten-fold more protein, in part through the loss of microRNA-mediated repression.
Moreover, expression of the shorter mRNA isoform of the proto-oncogene IGF2BP1/IMP-1 led to
far more oncogenic transformation than did expression of the full-length, annotated mRNA. The high
incidence of APA in cancer cells, with consequent loss of 3′UTR repressive elements, suggests a
pervasive role for APA in oncogene activation without genetic alteration.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Oncogene activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Mammalian genomes
contain proto-oncogenes that function to regulate normal cell proliferation and differentiation.
In cancer cells, these genes frequently have been activated—sometimes by a mutation that
changes the encoded proteins and other times by a mutation that increases the expression of
the gene. The increased expression can occur through several mechanisms, including gene
amplifications that increase copy number and chromosomal translocations that replace the
original promoter with a much more active one (Bishop, 1991; Rowley, 2001).
A recently recognized mechanism of oncogene activation is the loss of microRNA (miRNA)
complementary sites (Mayr et al., 2007; Lee and Dutta, 2007). miRNAs specify
posttranscriptional repression by pairing to short sites in mRNA targets, usually in 3′UTRs
(Bartel, 2009). In the case of HMGA2 activation, chromosomal translocations swap the
HMGA2 3′UTR for that of another gene, which results in loss of complementary sites for the

let-7 miRNA and escape from repression (Mayr et al., 2007; Lee and Dutta, 2007). In principle,
point substitutions or other lesions that disrupt individual target sites or that shorten the 3′UTR
through premature cleavage and polyadenylation could have the same effect (Majoros and
Ohler, 2007). Hinting at this possibility are events associated with a more aggressive subgroup
of mantle cell lymphomas. Mantle cell lymphomas are characterized by the t(11;14)(q13;q32)
translocation, which brings Cyclin D1 near the highly active immunoglobulin heavy chain gene
promoter, leading to Cyclin D1 overexpression. In a subset of mantle cell lymphomas a second
alteration of Cyclin D1, the shortening of its 3′UTR, which might relieve miRNA-directed
repression, leads to an additional 1.6-fold increase in Cyclin D1 expression and correlates with
both increased proliferation of the lymphoma cells and decreased overall survival of patients
(Rosenwald et al., 2003). The reasons for 3′UTR shortening are unknown in a third of cases,
but in the remaining cases either genomic deletions encompass much of the 3′UTR or point
substitutions create premature cleavage and polyadenylation signals (Wiestner et al., 2007).
For some cases in which DNA lesions are not found, the Cyclin D1 3′UTR might be shortened
through alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA).

Cleavage and polyadenylation is required for the maturation of most mRNA transcripts
(Proudfoot, 1991; Colgan and Manley, 1997). The pre-mRNA is cleaved 10–30 nt after the
polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA and variants thereof) and an untemplated poly(A) tract is
added. Although a strong polyadenylation signal usually is located at the 3′ end of the 3′UTR,
nearly all genes have additional polyadenylation signals in their 3′UTRs, with about half of
human genes possessing conserved APA signals with usage supported by expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) (Tian et al., 2005). Use of APA signals often eliminates large parts of the 3′UTR,
enabling escape from the stronger regulatory potential of longer 3′UTRs. Besides miRNA
regulation, the lost regulatory sequences in the 3′UTR can influence mRNA nuclear export and
cytoplasmic localization, as well as non-miRNA-mediated changes in mRNA stability and
translational efficiency (Moore, 2005). Alternative mRNAs that differ in their 3′UTRs can exist
in different tissues or developmental stages, and studies have shown that these mRNA isoforms
can have different stability or translational activity (Miyamoto et al., 1996; Takagaki et al.,
1996; Edwalds-Gilbert et al., 1997; Lutz, 2008). Over 30 years ago, stimulation of lymphocytes
was shown to increase both RNA polyadenylation and the rate of protein synthesis, without a
change in the rate of transcription (Coleman et al., 1974; Hauser et al., 1978). Recently, a
genome-wide study identified shorter 3′UTRs in activated T cells compared to resting T cells,
and found that in general shorter 3′UTRs were associated with cell proliferation (Sandberg et
al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We set out to explore the possibility that APA might be a mechanism by which genes can
escape miRNA-mediated repression in cancer. We found that shorter 3′UTRs were indeed
associated with tumor cells, over and above the association expected from their proliferative
state. Reporter assays and immunoblots revealed the functional consequences of APA, showing
that the shorter transcripts produced substantially more protein than did their full-length
counterparts, in part through escape of miRNA-mediated targeting. Moreover, expressing the
shorter but not the full-length isoform of the proto-oncogene Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA
binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1/IMP-1/CRD-BP/ZBP-1) led to oncogenic transformation,
illustrating that loss of repressive 3′UTR elements through APA can promote the oncogenic
phenotype.

Results
Shorter 3′UTRs are associated with transformation
To find altered mRNA length and abundance, we used Northern blots probing RNA from 27
cancer cell lines from different tissues. The cell lines were derived from sarcomas and breast,
lung and colon cancers, and compared to immortalized non-transformed epithelial cell lines

and normal corresponding tissues. We chose to analyze 23 genes. Gene function was not
considered when selecting these genes. One criterion for selecting a gene was that there were
potential APA signals in the 3′UTR. AAUAAA is the canonical polyadenylation signal, but
variants of this signal, including AUUAAA, AAGAAA, UAUAAA, AGUAAA are also used.
These variants are used less often as the polyadenylation signal for the longest isoform but
more often as proximal polyadenylation signals (Tian et al., 2005). When including these
variants, nearly every gene had potential APA signals, and thus this criterion imposed only a
minor constraint. The other selection criterion was that the mRNA have strong potential for
miRNA regulation, as predicted by TargetScan (version 4.2, (Lewis et al., 2005; Grimson et
al., 2007). With one exception (IMP-3), mRNAs with at least two sites to a single miRNA were
chosen (Table 1). Reasoning that the miRNAs would be relevant only if expressed in the cancer
cell lines, we considered only widely expressed miRNAs (e.g., let-7, miR-15/16 and
miR-103/107) and confirmed their expression in the cell lines by Northern blots (Figure S1).
For example, we investigated the top ten predicted targets of let-7.

Sixteen of the 23 candidate genes were expressed in the cell lines. In nine of these 16, more
than one mRNA isoform was detected (Figures 1A and S2). To investigate if the difference in
mRNA length was due to APA, 3′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed.
For three of the nine genes with multiple isoforms, the differences in mRNA lengths were due
to alternative splicing (data not shown), but for the other six, the differences were due to APA
(Figure 1B). For the shorter mRNA isoforms of these six genes, the canonical AAUAAA signal
was used in three cases, the variant AAGAAA in three cases, the variant AUUAAA in two
cases, and in the other two cases the signals were clustered (AAGAAAAAUAAA), making it
difficult to assign which one was used (Figure 1B). Thirty percent of these signals (all
AAUAAA) were conserved at the orthologous position in all four mammals examined (human,
mouse, rat and dog), and in many of the other cases signals were present at non-orthologous
positions. The most 3′ located polyadenylation signal was always AAUAAA and always
conserved at the orthologous position.
GU- or U-rich sequences are often found downstream of functional cleavage and
polyadenylation signals and are important for signal recognition (Proudfoot, 1991; Colgan and
Manley, 1997). Indeed, examining composition of the 200 nucleotides surrounding the
functional proximal polyadenylation signals and comparing it with that of the nucleotides
surrounding the apparently nonfunctional polyadenylation signals in the genes for which only
the full-length mRNA isoform was detected revealed an over-representation of U-rich
sequences within 50 nt downstream of the functional poly(A) signals (p = 0.02; Figure S3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The genes with alternative isoforms included Cyclin D1, DICER1 and RAB10, which were
expressed in all samples, and IMP-1, Cyclin D2 and FGF2, which were expressed in at least
a third of the samples. The shorter mRNAs usually were detectable in normal tissues but more
prominent in cancer lines (Figures 1A and S2). The bands of the longest and the shortest mRNA
isoform were quantified to determine the expression ratio. Comparing the ratios between the
cell lines and their normal corresponding tissues revealed that a majority of the cell lines
expressed a higher fraction of the shorter mRNA isoform (p <10−3) (Figure 2A, purple). These
results concurred with those of Sandberg et al. (2008), who associated shorter 3′UTRs with a
proliferative state. However, the previous study did not distinguish between cancer cell lines
and non-transformed proliferating cells. When making this distinction for the lines used in our
study, higher amounts of shorter mRNAs were detected significantly more often in cancer cell
lines than in non-transformed cell lines (p <10−4), indicating that shorter mRNAs are associated
with transformation even more than they are associated with proliferation (Figure 2B). Indeed,
no significant difference was found between the non-transformed cell lines compared with
normal tissues (p = 0.35; Figure 2B).

One possibility raised by our findings was that APA-mediated shortening of 3′UTRs is a cancerassociated phenomenon, without any association with proliferation after accounting for the
association with cellular transformation. Alternatively, a more global analysis might still reveal
an association with proliferation. To address this issue, we revisited the dataset of Sandberg et
al. (2008), who analyzed array data across a broad panel of mammalian cell lines and tissues
for differences in both proliferation and 3′UTR length. They created a tandem UTR length
index (TLI) to assess aggregate expression of extended 3′UTR regions relative to overall geneexpression levels, and correlated this UTR-length measurement with a gene-signature-based
measure of cellular proliferation, called the proliferation index, across a panel of 135 samples.
These samples included 22 cancer cell lines, one cancer sample, five non-transformed cell
lines, ten samples derived from blood cells and 97 tissues. After subgrouping their data based
on these sample types (Figure 2C), we confirmed that even after excluding the cancer lines,
proliferation influenced 3′UTR length: Stimulation of blood cells, including T cells, B cells
and monocytes, significantly reduced 3′UTR length when compared to their unstimulated
counterparts (p = 0.04) or normal tissues (p = 0.005), and non-transformed cell lines also had
shorter 3′UTRs than normal tissues (p = 0.02; Figure 2D). But most strikingly, the cancer cell
lines had the shortest 3′UTRs (Figures 2C and 2D, red), which were significantly shorter than
the 3′UTRs of non-transformed cell lines (p = 0.007) despite comparable proliferation indices
(p = 0.6). This analysis extending our Northern blot results from a limited number of genes to
a genome-wide scale confirmed that shorter 3′UTRs are associated with transformation over
and above the association expected from their proliferative state.
Shorter mRNAs have greater stability and produce more protein
What might be the functional consequence of shorter 3′UTRs? In all cases investigated,
predicted miRNA target sites were lost in the shorter isoform (Figure 1B). Because miRNAs
often destabilize their target mRNAs (Bartel, 2009), the stabilities of the longer and the shorter
mRNAs were examined in nine cell lines from diverse tissues for three genes with the most
robust mRNA Northern signals (IMP-1, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D2). Cells were treated with
Actinomycin D to inhibit transcription, total RNA was collected, and the decay of the mRNA
isoforms was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Across different tissues and different
genes, the shorter mRNA was on average 2.6-times more stable than was the longer mRNA
(Table 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to mRNA destabilization, miRNAs can also direct translational repression of their
target mRNAs, which adds to their impact on protein output (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et
al., 1993; Filipowicz et al., 2008). To investigate if different amounts of protein were produced
from the shorter and the longer isoforms, we used reporter assays. Both the short and the long
3′UTR isoforms of IMP-1, Cyclin D2, and DICER1 were each cloned downstream of a
luciferase reporter gene. To ensure that each long isoform was expressed, for these reporters
all the proximal polyadenylation signals that were functional (as detected by 3′ RACE) were
mutated (Figure 1B). A strong poly(A) signal from SV40 virus was added downstream of the
endogenous polyadenylation signal of the short isoform, as well as that of the long isoform, to
ensure both isoforms were expressed as intended. Luciferase reporter gene expression was
measured for all three genes in 16 cell lines from different tissues. For all genes in all the cell
lines tested, the shorter mRNA isoform produced more protein (Figure 3). The protein
expression derived from the shorter mRNA was 1.6–42-fold higher than that from the longer
mRNA (IMP-1 median, 8.0 fold; DICER1 median, 5.5 fold; Cyclin D2 median, 14.8 fold;
average difference overall, 10 fold).
Contribution of miRNA regulation on differential protein expression levels
Although the greater mRNA destabilization and translational repression observed for the longer
isoforms was consistent with regulation by the miRNAs expressed endogenously within the

cell lines, other types of posttranscriptional repression lost in the shorter isoforms also might
have explained some or all of the observed differences. To begin to determine the impact of
miRNA regulation on protein expression, we mutated the miRNA complementary sites for the
miRNAs with the highest number of sites. The five let-7 sites in the IMP-1 3′UTR, the six sites
for miR-103/107 in the DICER1 3′UTR and the three sites for miR-15/16 in the Cyclin D2 3′
UTR were mutated in the context of the long isoform (Figure 1B), and luciferase activity was
examined, comparing activity from reporters with intact sites with that from those with mutant
sites. Loss of these miRNA sites led to expression increases of 1.0–1.8 fold across 16 cell lines
from various tissues (IMP-1 median, 1.4, range, 1.0–1.6; Cyclin D2 median, 1.3, range, 1.1–
1.8; DICER1 median, 1.2, range, 1.0–1.5)—rather modest effects when considering the number
of sites mutated (Figures 4A–4C). When the endogenous miRNAs were supplemented by
transfecting more of the cognate miRNAs, the reporter gene expression differences increased
up to 3.3 fold (data not shown), implying regulatory potential beyond that mediated by the
miRNAs at their endogenous levels and suggesting that the variability in response to the
endogenous miRNAs might depend on expression levels of the cognate miRNAs. Quantitative
Northern blots of miRNAs across the cell lines showed that, overall, let-7 levels were the
highest, miR-15/16 levels were intermediate, and miR-103/107 levels were about 5 times lower
than those of let-7 (Figure S1). In addition to its six miR-103/107 sites, the DICER1 3′UTR
has two let-7 sites. Mutating these sites led to a median expression increase of 1.3 (range 1.0–
1.8 fold), which was higher than that of mutating the six miR-103/107 sites, consistent with
the idea that let-7, based on its higher expression, might have been more effective in these cells
(Figure 4D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To find additional miRNAs endogenously expressed in these cell lines and to measure the
relative expression of the miRNAs examined, we profiled the miRNAs by high-throughput
sequencing. The let-7 miRNA family was either the highest or the second highest sequenced
family in the investigated cell lines (with the exception of HEK293 cells where it ranked eighth
highest) and corresponded to 3.3%–34% (median, 16.8%) of all miRNA sequencing reads in
the cells (Table S1). Consistent with the Northern blots, miR-103/107 was sequenced less
frequently, ranking 3–16 of all miRNA families expressed in these cells and corresponding to
0.74%–5.8% of the reads (median, 2.4%). Considering the expression levels of the different
miRNAs in the different cell types, variability in miRNA expression explained a significant
fraction of the variability in reporter expression (r2 = 0.20, p = 0.001, Figure S4). By taking
this correlation into account and extrapolating to the other miRNA sites (conserved and
nonconserved) predicted by TargetScan to match coexpressed miRNAs, we estimated the
maximum repression attributable to miRNAs to range from 1.9–4.1 fold for the three 3′UTRs
in the 12 cell lines with profiled miRNAs (IMP-1 median, 2.8, range, 2.5–3.5; DICER1 median,
2.7, range, 1.9–3.2; Cyclin D2 median, 2.4, range, 1.9–4.1; Figure S4 and Table S2). These
rough estimates were typically lower than the average increases in luciferase reporter gene
expression for the short 3′UTR in these 12 lines (IMP-1, 7.7 fold, DICER1: 6.6 fold, Cyclin
D2: 15.3 fold). Thus, loss of miRNA regulation appears to account for a quarter to two-thirds
of the increase in protein-expression levels observed with the short 3′UTRs. In 20–40% of the
cell lines (dependent on the gene investigated) loss of miRNA regulation might even explain
all the difference in protein expression. However, for the majority of cell lines miRNA
regulation explained only a part of the difference in protein expression between the short and
the long mRNAs, indicating a net repressive effect of other regulatory phenomena lost in the
shorter UTRs as a consequence of APA.
Impact of 3′UTR sequence versus 3′UTR length
One explanation for the repression not attributable to miRNA targeting might be the length of
the mRNA itself. The difference in length between the shorter and the longer mRNA isoforms
was substantial (IMP-1, 6.3 kb, or 71% of the mRNA; DICER1, 4.3 kb, or 42% of the mRNA;

Cyclin D2, 3.5 kb, or 54% of the mRNA). Shorter mRNAs might more readily form a closedloop structure, which enhances translation, as shown recently in yeast (Amrani et al., 2008).
To find out if the length or specific sequences within the longer mRNA were responsible for
the difference in luciferase activity, the reverse complement (rc) of the UTR segment present
in the long but not the short IMP-1 mRNA isoform was cloned downstream the short 3′UTR,
while disrupting the proximal poly(A) signal. In four of the 15 cell lines tested, the short and
rc reporters had comparable protein production, which averaged 4-times higher than that from
a reporter with the long 3′UTR, suggesting that repressive sequences recognized by transacting factors present preferentially in these cell lines specify translational repression or mRNA
destabilization (Figure 4E). In the other cell lines, however, expression of the rc construct led
to intermediate gene expression. Although 3′UTR length might have some influence on gene
expression in these cell lines, our results for the other four lines speak against this as a general
phenomenon in human cells.
The shorter Cyclin D2 mRNA leads to more cells in S phase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Having found that the shorter mRNA isoforms were more stable and led to higher protein
expression, we wanted to test if there might be a phenotypic consequence of expressing the
shorter rather than the longer isoform. For Cyclin D2, we expressed either the full-length
mRNA or its shorter isoform in breast cancer cell lines. Cyclin D2 is not expressed
endogenously in these cell lines because of promoter hypermethylation(Evron et al., 2001). In
MCF7 cells, we observed an effect on the cell-cycle profile, with a lower fraction of cells in
G1 accompanied by a higher fraction of cells that had entered S phase (Figure 5A), which was
concordant with the function of Cyclin D2 in overcoming the G1/S checkpoint (Lukas et al.,
1995). This effect was significantly greater in cells expressing the short mRNA of Cyclin D2
compared with those expressing the long mRNA, and correlated with Cyclin D2 mRNA and
protein expression in these cells (Figure S5).
The shorter IMP-1 mRNA is oncogenic

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

IMP-1 is an RNA-binding protein that is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, including
those of the breast, lung and colon, where it potentially plays a role in stabilizating several
target mRNAs, including c-myc, β-catenin and β-TrCP1 (Ross et al., 1997; Doyle et al.,
1998; Nielsen et al., 1999; Noubissi et al., 2006). To learn the relative effects of the IMP-1
isoforms, we assayed colony formation in soft-agar after transducing cells with retroviral
vectors expressing either the short or long mRNA isoform. Expressing the full-length IMP-1
isoform (with mutations designed to prevent APA) produced a number of colonies comparable
to that of expressing the empty vector (p = 0.09), whereas expressing the short isoform greatly
promoted cell transformation (p = 0.002, Figure 5B). Much of this transformation was
attributable to loss of miRNA targeting, in that mutating the let-7 sites significantly enhanced
transformation from the long isoform (p = 0.002) and correlated with IMP-1 mRNA and protein
expression in these cells (Figure S6). The shorter isoform was not only able to transform
fibroblasts but also human breast epithelial cell lines (Figure S7). Taken together, our results
indicate that APA associated with cancer cells can activate an oncogene, thereby potentially
contributing to the pathogenesis of cancer.

Discussion
Recent reports propose that a change in 3′UTR length by means of APA is a coordinated
mechanism for altering expression of many genes during T cell activation (Sandberg et al.,
2008), neuronal activation (Flavell et al., 2008) or embryonic development (Ji et al., 2009).
For a better understanding of gene regulation, it will be important to identify additional cellular,
developmental and disease states that lead to increased use of proximal APA signals. We
observed shorter 3′UTRs in cancer cell lines compared with non-transformed cell lines, despite

similar proliferation rates of the transformed and non-transformed lines, thereby linking 3′UTR
shortening with oncogenic transformation even more than with cellular proliferation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Many proto-oncogenes play roles in proliferation and differentiation of normal cells and must
be highly regulated to prevent malignant transformation. In normal cells, the full-length,
annotated transcripts were expressed and presumably responsible for normal proto-oncogene
function, but in cancer cells, substantially more shorter isoforms were also expressed, which
typically differed from the full-length mRNAs only in the length of their 3′UTRs. Our reporter
assays and immunoblots revealed that the APA-mediated 3′UTR shortening can have striking
functional consequences in the cancer cell lines, with the shorter mRNA isoforms typically
producing ten-times more protein. These results suggested that the cancer-associated
shortening of 3′UTRs could activate oncogenes, thereby reinforcing the transformed state. In
support of this hypothesis, we found that the shorter IMP-1 isoform promoted oncogenic
transformation far more efficiently than did the longer one.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The oncogenic potential of IMP-1 was previously demonstrated using a transgenic mouse
model with IMP-1 under the promoter of whey acidic protein, which is induced in mammary
epithelial cells in pregnant and lactating female mice (Tessier et al., 2004). The construct
overexpressing IMP-1 in these mice contained only the first 288 nt of the 6.3 kb annotated 3′
UTR. Our results, which showed both that cancer cells endogenously express a shorter isoform
with a 369-nt 3′UTR (with the orthologous mouse isoform estimated to have a 336-nt 3′UTR)
and that this shorter isoform is the one that was oncogenic, support the in vivo relevance of the
previous transgenic model.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Part of the IMP-1 oncogene activation observed in our soft-agar assays was explained by escape
of the shorter isoform from miRNA-mediated repression. Since the discovery of miRNAs in
mammalian cells, much has been learned about their roles in tumorigenesis. Some miRNAs,
including the miR-17~92 cluster are amplified in human cancers and act as oncogenes when
overexpressed in mice (Ota et al., 2004; He et al., 2005). Others, including miR-15/16, miR-34
and the let-7 miRNAs, are deleted or downregulated in cancers and are reported to act as tumorsuppressor genes (Calin et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2005; Mayr et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007;
He et al., 2007). These miRNAs playing tumor-suppressor roles can do so only when their
targets retain the cognate regulatory sites. Thus, another important mechanism for oncogenic
transformation is the loss of miRNA sites in the mRNAs of oncogenes. This loss can occur
through genetic aberrations, such as the translocations that abrogate let-7 repression of the
HMGA2 oncogene (Mayr et al., 2007; Lee and Dutta, 2007). Our results uncovered an
epigenetic mechanism (using the broader sense of the word “epigenetic”) that achieved the
same effect: oncogenes can escape miRNA-mediated repression through 3′UTR shortening
due to the APA prevalent in cancer cells. Our data suggests that this epigenetic mechanism is
more prevalent than is the genetic one because cancer cells had the shortest UTRs as indicated
by their low TLI (a transcriptome-wide index), and APA generated the different transcripts in
over a third of the expressed genes examined in detail.
Escape from miRNA-mediated repression explained only part of the upregulation conferred
by APA. In addition to miRNAs, AU-rich or GU-rich elements can specify repression (Chen
and Shyu, 1995; Vlasova et al., 2008), but a search of the tested 3′UTRs did not reveal these
elements. Thus, our results implicated additional, as-yet-undefined regulatory elements in these
3′UTRs. Interestingly, the net effect of these elements was never activating—whenever an
effect was observed, it was repressive. Although activating regulatory elements undoubtedly
occur in some 3′UTRs and the net effect of all RNA elements might be activating in some 3′
UTRs or cell types, our results support the idea that regulatory phenomena acting on 3′UTRs
are generally repressive. This conclusion holds despite the bias in selecting for study 3′UTRs
with multiple sites to coexpressed miRNAs, because even after all those sites were mutated,

we still observed only repression. The overall repressive character of 3′UTRs could help
explain why nearly all successful transgenic mouse models of tumorigenesis overexpress
oncogenes missing large segments of their annotated 3′UTRs (Ruther et al., 1987; Fedele et
al., 2002; Primrose and Twyman, 2006). As with IMP-1, our results indicate that these models
expressing shorter versions of the mRNA are more biologically relevant than might have been
anticipated when they were first generated.

One of the most interesting open questions regarding APA in cancer cells is, what mechanism
underlies the recognition and increased utilization of proximal polyadenylation signals? In the
sequence surrounding the proximal polyadenylation sites we never found point mutations that
would have changed the strength of the polyadenylation signal, with the caveat that by 3′ RACE
we investigated only the sequences upstream of the cleavage sites. Although mutations
downstream of the cleavage sites cannot be excluded, we hypothesize that differential
expression of trans-acting factors explains the use of proximal polyadenylation sites in cancer
cells. Factors that might influence the choice of polyadenylation signal include limiting
components of the polyadenylation machinery, RNA-binding proteins that bind in the vicinity
of the proximal signal and influence recognition by the polyadenylation machinery (Takagaki
et al., 1996; Martincic et al., 1998; Veraldi et al., 2001; Lutz, 2008; Wang et al., 2008), and
perhaps factors that influence transcriptional elongation rate(Kornblihtt, 2005). To begin to
identify such factors, we examined published array data comparing breast cancer cells with a
breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A (Hoeflich et al., 2009). A survey of the constitutive
components of the polyadenylation machinery and other candidates from the literature revealed
several that were significantly upregulated in the cancer lines (Figure S8). These included the
mRNAs of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 1 (CPSF1) and cleavage stimulation
factor 2 (CSTF2), which recognize the poly(A) signal and accessory sequences including the
downstream G/U-rich sequence, respectively, raising the intriguing possibility that an increase
of these factors might help increase utilization of sub-optimal proximal poly(A) signals in
cancer cells.

We imagine a complex scenario in which some trans-acting factors act globally, some act tissue
specifically, and some act gene specifically, with the combinatorial expression of all the
different trans-acting factors determining the probability of using each proximal
polyadenylation signal. The observation of higher amounts of shorter mRNAs in cancer cells
compared with normal cells, with no examples of the reverse for any of the genes and cell types
studied, suggested a role for globally acting factors. That some cell lines showed high amounts
of shorter transcripts for all genes investigated further implicated the role of globally acting
factors. Nonetheless, the differences observed for different genes in different cell types
suggested a role for additional factors acting more specifically. Such complexity could explain
the differential impact of different oncogenes in different tissues. Indeed, some of the genes
for which we did not observe alternative mRNAs are known oncogenes in tissues not included
in our panel of cell lines (ARID3B in neuroblastomas, MYB and PLAG1 in hematological
malignancies). Perhaps shorter mRNA transcripts might be found in the tissues where these
genes have oncogenic effects. Moreover, the prospect of some factors acting more specifically
opens the possibility for exceptions to the trend of shorter isoforms expressed preferentially in
cancer cells. Combinatorial use of tissue-specific and gene-specific trans-acting factors could
for some genes (most intriguingly, for tumor-suppressor genes) lead to higher amounts of
shorter mRNAs in normal cells rather than in cancer cells.
The prevalence of APA in cancer lines brought to the fore the question of what influence it
might have on oncogenes, and our results for IMP-1 supported the idea that APA was activating.
However, APA creates shorter, less repressed isoforms of more than just known oncogenes,
as illustrated for DICER1. Because some of these genes likely act in opposition to oncogenes,
the net functional significance of APA in cancer cells is unknown, and in principle could even

be tumor suppressive. During both normal development and cancer development there is often
a dichotomy of cell proliferation and differentiation (Derynck and Wagner, 1995). The
association of APA with cell proliferation suggests that it might represent a coordinated geneexpression program that antagonizes differentiation during normal development. Accordingly,
we propose that cancer cells coopt and exaggerate this proliferation/de-differentiation program
with the net effect of enhanced tumorigenesis.
Our observations that the shorter mRNAs were found in transformed cells and that expression
of the shorter mRNA of IMP-1 (and presumably other oncogenes) can lead to transformation
suggests a APA-mediated feed-forward loop in cancer that might lead to a more aggressive
phenotype. This proposal is in agreement with the report on mantle cell lymphomas, in which
the patients that have shorter Cyclin D1 3′UTRs have the worst prognosis (Rosenwald et al.,
2003; Wiestner et al., 2007). However, when this process of generating shorter mRNAs would
start and whether APA might play a role in early tumorigenesis is unclear. In general, shorter
mRNAs were not observed in non-transformed cell lines, which usually already have one hit
towards cancer but are not yet fully transformed. Perhaps if an early lesion activates a signaling
pathway that is able to change the expression of a key trans-acting factor, then APA would
contribute to early steps in oncogenesis.

Oncogenes are reported to be overexpressed in human tumors much more frequently than
genetic lesions are detected at these loci. Our results could explain some of this discrepancy,
because overexpression of oncogenes due to APA-mediated shortening of mRNA transcripts
was a widespread phenomenon in the cancer cells investigated. The epigenetic nature of this
mechanism for oncogene activation suggests that it can be reversed, perhaps providing a new
strategy for cancer treatment.

Experimental procedures
Northern blots
Total RNA was isolated using Tri-reagent (Ambion). miRNAs were detected as described,
loading 20 μg per lane (Mayr et al., 2007). mRNA was detected using a protocol adapted from
Cold Spring Harbour Protocols (Sambrook et al., 2006), loading in each lane 1.5–2 μg
polyadenylated RNA purified from total RNA with Oligotex (Qiagen).
mRNA stability
Cell lines were treated with Actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), and after 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours total
RNA was isolated and analyzed on Northern blots.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

3′ RACE
This protocol was adapted from Cold Spring Harbour Protocols (Sambrook et al., 2006). 1 μg
total RNA was used to generate cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions using TAP as a primer. The first PCR was done
with a gene-specific forward primer and AP as reverse primer. Nested PCR was done with a
nested gene-specific forward primer and MAP as reverse primer. The PCR product from the
nested PCR was separated on an agarose gel, cloned and sequenced. If only full-length mRNAs
were found by 3′ RACE, Northern blots were reprobed with different probes in the ORF to
find alternatively spliced isoforms.
Luciferase assays
Luciferase assays were performed as described (Mayr et al., 2007). To account for differences
in plasmid preparations, values for each wild-type reporter were normalized to those for its
cognate mutant-site reporter by using values from cells that lacked or expressed the relevant

Small RNA cloning
Small RNAs were cloned and analyzed as described previously (Grimson et al., 2008). The
miRNA cloning data have been deposited at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
repository (GSE16579).
Cell cycle analysis by FACS
Cells were plated at comparable densities, harvested after 48h, fixed with ethanol and stained
with propidium iodide (50μg/ml) and RNase A (40U/ml) and DNA content was measured on
a FACS Calibur HTS (Becton Dickinson). The percentage of diploid cells in G1, S and G2
were analyzed by ModFitLT V3.1.
Soft-agar assay
Soft-agar assays were performed as described (Mayr et al., 2007).
Statistics

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the difference between several independent
subgroups. Mann Whitney test was applied to analyze the difference between two independent
supgroups. The Wilcoxon test was used to make pairwise comparisons using SPSS 14.0.

(A) Quantification of alternative mRNA isoforms. Expression ratio of shortest to longest
mRNA isoform from Figures 1A and S2 was normalized to that of the corresponding normal
tissue and shown as log2 values. For the sarcoma cell lines no normal tissue was available,
therefore the values were normalized to the median of expression of all normal tissues.
IMP-1 was not expressed in any of the normal tissues, and thus IMP-1 ratios were normalized
to that of HEK293, because for the other genes examined the expression ratios of the mRNA
isoforms in HEK293 cells were similar to those of the normal tissues. FGF2 was not expressed
in normal breast tissue; therefore FGF2 ratios of the breast cell lines were normalized to that
MCF10A, a non-transformed breast epithelial line, whose expression ratio of short and long
mRNA isoforms resembled that of normal breast tissue for the other genes analyzed. Ratios
used for normalization are shaded grey; those with a higher fraction of shorter isoform are
purple; those with a lower fraction of shorter isoform are shaded light blue, and cases without
detectable mRNA are blank. Cells and tissues are color-coded as in Figure 1A.
(B) Distributions of alternative mRNAs for cancer cells and non-transformed cells. Plotted are
the values from Figure 2A, which are the expression ratios of shorter to longer mRNA isoforms,
normalized to the corresponding normal tissue. The value for Cyclin D1 in the breast cancer
cell line MB453, which was 8.5 (log2), is not included because a deletion encompassing the 3′
UTR is responsible for the shorter mRNA (Lebwohl et al., 1994). For non-transformed cell
lines, the distribution is not significantly displaced from zero (p = 0.35), indicating similar
ratios of shorter to longer mRNA isoforms as the normal tissues. For cancer cell lines, the ratio
is significantly displaced from both zero (p <10−4) and the distribution for non-transformed
cell lines (p <10−4), indicating increased ratios of the shorter isoforms.

two let-7 sites (long-mut-let-7) or both the two let-7 sites and the six miR-103/107 sites (longmut-all).
(E) Influence of the length of the IMP-1 3′UTR on protein expression. The reverse complement
(rc) of the difference between the shortest and the full-length mRNA isoforms of IMP-1 was
cloned downstream the shortest 3′UTR, while mutating the proximal poly(A) signal.

Expression of the reporter possessing the shortest 3′UTR and of that also possessing the rc,
each normalized to expression of the reporter containing the full-length isoform. The number
of transfections is shown (n = 9, performed in three independent experiments, each with three
transfections of each reporter), with error bars indicating standard deviation.

(A) The short mRNA isoform of Cyclin D2 increases the fraction of cells in S phase. For MCF7
cells stably transduced with retroviral vectors, the percentage of cells that were in G1 and S
phase were measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Plotted is the
mean (± s.d.) of three independent experiments.
(B) The short mRNA isoform of IMP-1 promotes oncogenic transformation. For NIH3T3 cells
stably transduced with retroviral vectors, the percentage that yielded colonies after 28 days
was plotted (median, horizontal line; 25th through 75th percentile, box; range, error bars; outlier,
*; n = 18 from six independent experiments, each in triplicate). The vectors expressed either
the long mRNA isoform of IMP-1 with mutations designed to prevent APA but retaining intact
let-7 sites (IMP-1-long-wt) or the analogous long mRNA isoform with mutant let-7 sites
(IMP-1-long-mut) or the shortest mRNA isoform of IMP-1 (IMP-1-short).
