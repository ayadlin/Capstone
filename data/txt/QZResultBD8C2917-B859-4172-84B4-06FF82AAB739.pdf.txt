ABSTRACT
Stem cell-like colon cancer cells (SCCs) pose a major challenge in colon cancer
treatment because of their resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Oncolytic
virus-based therapy has shown promising results in uncured cancer patients; however,
its effects on SCCs are not well studied yet. Here, we engineered a cancer-favoring
oncolytic vaccinia virus (CVV) as a potent biotherapeutic and investigated its therapeutic
efficacy in terms of killing SCCs. CVV is an evolved Wyeth strain vaccinia virus (EVV)
lacking the viral thymidine kinase. SCC models were established using human or
mouse colon cancer spheres, which continuously expressed stemness markers. The
cancer-favoring characteristics and different cytotoxic pathways for killing cancer
cells successfully overrode general drug resistance, thereby killing colon cancer cells
regardless of the presence of SCCs. Subcutaneously injected HT29 spheres showed
lower growth in CVV-treated models than in 5-Fu-treated models. Intraperitoneally
injected CT26 spheres induced tumor masses in the abdominal region. CVV-treated
groups showed higher survival rates and smaller tumor mass formation, compared to
5-Fu-treated groups. Interestingly, the combined treatment of CVV with 5-Fu showed
improved survival rates and complete suppression of tumor mass. The CVV developed
in this study, thus, effectively suppresses SCCs, which can be synergistically enhanced
by simultaneous treatment with the anticancer drug 5-Fu. Our novel CVV is highly
advantageous as a next-generation therapeutic for treating colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

malignant tumors even though CSCs constitute a minor
population in tumors. Drug resistance and tumor recurrence
after the initial response to chemo- or radiotherapy may
be due to the survival of CSCs within the original tumor.
Therefore, SCCs pose a considerable challenge and are
considered the next target in colon cancer treatment.
Genetic engineering of viruses provides unprecedented
opportunities for various biomedical applications, including
drug/gene delivery, tissue engineering, targeting cancer,
and/or cancer imaging [4–11]. Oncolytic viruses (OVs)
are unique biomaterials having merits over conventional
anticancer reagents in terms of their tumor selectivity and
ability to lyse cancer cells. Tumor selectivity is usually
introduced by genetic engineering, which attenuates

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, with
a mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 individuals per year) of
approximately 14% worldwide. Among the various types
of cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC) has a relatively poor
prognosis and is diagnosed as the third most common cancer
in men and the second in women in 2012 [1, 2]. Despite
advances in anticancer drug development, most CRCs
are resistant to conventional cancer therapy. This poor
responsiveness to chemo- and/or radiotherapy might be
attributed to stem cell-like colon cancer cells (SCCs) [3]. It is
generally accepted that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are capable
of self-renewal and have the exclusive ability to reproduce

viral replication in normal cells. In our previous study,
clinically applied JX-594 conferred tumor selectivity via
viral thymidine kinase (vTK) inactivation because vaccinia
virus has evolved to replicate in EGFR pathway-activated
cells, which are usually cancer cells with high cellular TK
levels [10, 12–14]. Thus, OVs can selectively infect and
replicate in cancer cells. OVs are replication competent;
thus, the infectious progeny generated by OV replication
in tumor cells can expand to kill the tumor mass, whereas
OV rarely harms normal cells. OV-based therapy in actual
clinical settings began over a century ago, demonstrating the
effectiveness of OVs in cancer treatment [13, 15–17]. Among
them, vaccinia virus-based therapy is well tolerated and
has shown relatively low side effects: minor and expected
controllable toxicity and no evidence of uncontrolled or
latent infection, or unexpected disease occurrence [18].
Despite the above proven efficacy of OVs in
cancer cells/tissues in clinical settings, the effects of
OVs on SCCs need to be investigated further. Herein,
we engineered a cancer-favoring oncolytic vaccinia virus
(CVV) and investigated its effects on CRC in terms of
killing SCCs. We hypothesized that the cancer-favoring
characteristics, cancer cell selectivity, and cancer cell
infectivity mediated by vaccinia virus differ from those
of conventional anti-cancer drugs; thus they may help
suppress the growth of SCCs.

units (pfu) virus/mouse because CVV may have a higher
replication rate than the WT virus or EVV. The infectious
dose of the WT or JX594 viruses used in a previous
in vivo study was more than 107 pfu [14]. As expected, CVV
infection exhibited better results than WT or EVV, even with
a single injection at the low dose of 106 pfu/mouse.
The higher anti-cancer efficacy of CVV in colon
cancer cells is due to its greater selectivity (cancer-favoring
characteristics via evolution and TK deletion). To test
the tumor selectivity and safety for normal tissues, tumor
tissues and normal tissues (kidney, liver, spleen, lung, heart,
brain, colon, stomach, and testis) were harvested at 2 weeks
after intraperitoneal injection of HT29 cells into nude mice,
and virus titers in each tissue (pfu/mg) confirmed that
selective infection of tumor tissues occurred (Figure 1D).
We found marginal viral replication (~5 pfu/mg) in normal
kidney and liver tissues, and no viral replication in normal
spleen, lung, and colon tissues in the biodistribution data,
which was is marked contrast with viral titers found
in tumor tissues (~106 pfu/mg). The higher toxicity of
CVV in cancer cells than in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs), used as normal cells might be ascribed to its higher
infectivity in CRC cell lines (Figure 1E), and the fact that
the CVV infectivity was much lower than that in cancer cell
lines. The reason why we found viral replication in MEF
cell lines, but not in normal tissues, in the biodistribution
data may be because selectivity can be generally measured
only when a virus has the option to infect either normal or
tumor tissues. Within MEF cells, viral replication should
occur in normal cells (given no other choice) by utilizing
the replication properties of the cell lines. Therefore, higher
infectivity in cancer cell lines than that in normal cells can
explain why CVV selectively distributed to tumor tissues.
To demonstrate the cancer-favoring and oncolytic potency
of CVV in colon cancer, a panel of CRC cell lines (HT-29,
DLD-1, HCT-116, SNU4, SNU5, and/or Lovo) was tested.
Following infection, CVV showed higher toxicity than the
WT virus in the various CRC cell lines (Figure 2).

RESULTS
CVV selectively infects and kills various CRC
cell lines better than VR1536
CVV was generated by replacing the vTK gene from
a naturally evolved cancer-favoring Wyeth strain vaccinia
virus (EVV) strain [19] with the green fluorescence protein
gene (Figure 1A). EVV was constructed from the Wyeth
strain of vaccinia virus to achieve the cancer-favoring
property and then isolated and characterized by repeated
replication and tumor tissue lysis [19]. EVV was isolated
from the blood of a vaccinia virus-injected VX2 tumor
animal model when the tumor size became reduced and
started to release viruses into the serum. Previously, we
found that EVV had superior tumor selectivity compared
with the wild type (WT) virus and other engineered vaccinia
viruses [19]. CVV may work highly effectively compared
to other type of virus. Replication efficacy generally reflects
the antitumor activity and was examined in CT26 cells
(Figure 1B). Viral replication assay results showed that CVV
deficient of vTk showed lower infection at 24 h, but showed
higher replication rates subsequently, compared to EVV
and the WT virus. A lower initial replication of CVV likely
resulted from vTk deficiency, where higher replication rates
of CVV in Tk-activated host cancer cell lines are attributable
to its higher tumor selectivity. Enhanced suppression of
colon tumors by CVV treatment, compared to PBS, WT,
or EVV administration, was confirmed in an in vivo CT26
xenograft model (Figure 1C). We used 106 plaque-forming

CVV might overcome resistance observed in
stem cell-like cancer cell populations
CVV infection showed greater toxicity than that of
the anti-colon cancer drug CPT11 in CRCs (HT29, LOVO,
DLD-1, and HCT-116), as shown in Figure 3A. The units
used for CVV and CPT11 treatment are the multiplicity
of infection (MOI) and the micromolar concentration,
respectively. Although a direct comparison of the viral
MOI and CPT11 concentration is impossible, it is safe
to assume that the virus concentration used was much
lower than CPT11 concentration used when considering
their approximate molar concentrations. In addition, all
of the cell lines tested showed resistance to CPT11, even
up to doses of ~10 μM (Figure 3A). We then analyzed
the percentage of the CD133+/CD44+ double-positive cell
population, which represents SCCs, and its relation to drug
resistance. The population of SCCs is shown in Figure 3B

(left panel). The percent viability of each CRC after CVV
infection (MOI = 10) or CPT treatment (10 μM) is shown
in the right panel of Figure 3B. Interestingly, the percentage
of the CD133+/CD44+ population appeared to be related
with CPT11 resistance, whereby the CD133+ population
seemed to majorly confer the percentage of CD133+/CD44+
SCCs and, thus, drug resistance. In terms of the percent
cell viability of CPT11-treated HCT-116 cells, we observed
fluctuations in the WST-1 results, which exceeded 100%
compared to the viability of untreated cells (Figure 3A).
The observation of elevated cell viability of HCT-116
cells (over 100%) after the 72 h-treatment may have been
because WST-1 measures dehydrogenase activity, which
is generally elevated in cancer stem cells. We expect that
higher SCC populations remaining after CPT11 treatment
would give an enhanced signal, resulting in measured cell
viabilities of over 100%. The cytotoxicity of CVV towards
CPT11-resistant cells may overcome the stem cell-like
cancer cell population. The relative expression of ABCG2

also demonstrated the relationship between drug resistance
and the SCC population (Figure 3B bottom). Thus, CPT11
resistance might be related to the SCC population and
ABCG2 expression, whereas CVV showed dose-dependent
responses regardless of the SCC population, suggesting that
our CVV might overcome drug resistance originating from
the stem cell-like colon cancer cell population.

Stem cell-like colon cancer cells have sphereforming ability and highly tumorigenic, but are
more susceptible to CVV than to CPT11
Three-dimensional sphere cultures of tumor cells
lead to the enrichment of CSC populations [20]. To
confirm the relationship between sphere-forming ability
and cell stemness, CD133+/CD44+ and CD133−/CD44−
HT29 cells were analyzed after fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) and compared with unsorted HT29 cells.
As expected, double-positive (CD133+/CD44+) HT29 cells

showed better sphere-forming ability than did CD133−/
CD44− cells (Figure 4A). The sphere size of CD133+/CD44+
cells increased compared to CD133−/CD44− over sequential
days in culture. Immunostaining of HT29 spheres confirmed
that they expressed stemness marker proteins (Figure 4B).
When 5–7-day-old cultured spheres were dissociated
and re-cultured in stem cell media, HT29 spheres could
be formed repeatedly up to 6 or more times in sequential
sphere cultures. In addition, repeated sphere formation/
dissociation did not impair the sphere-forming ability or
stemness gene expression for up to 6 days (Figure 4C),
demonstrating that sphere formation contributes to the
characteristics of stemness of cancer cells. Different
numbers of monolayer-cultured and sphere-cultured
HT29 cells (5 × 103, 1 × 104, and 5 × 104) were injected
subcutaneously into Balb/c nude mice, after which
their tumorigenicity (Figure S1A) and tumor volumes
(Figure S1B) were examined As expected, HT29 spheres
showed characteristics of SCCs in a mouse in vivo model,
as earlier tumor formation and larger tumor volumes were
observed with the group injected sphere-cultured cell than
the group administered monolayer-cultured cell.

and harvested them after an additional 3 days in culture.
Monolayer-cultured HT29 cells (mono HT29) and spherecultured HT29 cells (sphere HT29) were also harvested.
Live cells (1 × 106), including mono HT29s, sphere HT29s,
sphere HT29s treated with 5-Fu (sphere HT29s+5-Fu),
and HT29s infected with CVV (sphere HT29s+CVV),
were injected subcutaneously into Balb/c nude mice,
and tumor growth from the injected surviving cells was
examined after treatment (Figure 5). As expected, animals
injected with HT29 spheres having the characteristics
of SCCs showed earlier and larger tumor growth versus
animals injected with monolayer-cultured cells. Animals
with surviving HT29 sphere cells after CVV treatment
showed attenuated tumor growth resulting from successful
killing of stem cell-like cells by CVV, whereas surviving
HT29 sphere cells following 5-Fu treatment did not
(Figure 5A & 5B). FACS analysis (Figure 5C, left panel)
and real-time PCR results (Figure 5C, right panel) showed
that the CD133+/CD44+ double-positive cell population
increased or decreased after 5-Fu or CVV treatment,
respectively, suggesting that CVV infection could kill stem
cell-like HT29 cells more so that 5-Fu treatment. Thus,
surviving cells after 5-Fu treatment showed much higher
levels of SCC marker expression. Therefore, cancerfavoring natural and engineered vaccinia viruses have
more powerful cancer selectivity and higher cytotoxicity.
The underlying mechanism, however, differs from that
of anticancer drugs, thereby obviating the problem of
resistance.

cancer cells by CVV may overcome anticancer
drug-resistance in SCCs
We then cultured HT29 spheres for 5 days, treated
them with 0.1 μM Fluorouracil (5-Fu) or CVV (MOI = 0.1),

internal peritoneal regions were examined. Intraperitoneally
injected sphere-cultured CT26 cells spread into the liver

the abdomen (in the PBS model). Interestingly, no tumor

induced apoptosis only in the tumor mass (Figure 6C).
The results showed that SCCs can respond better to CVV
than the anticancer drugs CPT11 or 5-Fu, particularly for
longer periods. We propose that this might be because
anticancer drugs are sufficiently cytotoxic to kill general
cancer cells, and thus, better results in the short-term are
exhibited. However, resistant SCCs can eventually emerge,
although the effect of CVV infection can override the effect
of resistance to anticancer drugs (Figure 7).

eradicate CSCs is expected to markedly improve clinical
outcomes. The most common way of identifying and
isolating CSCs is based on cell surface marker expression
using cell-separation methods, such as flow cytometry,
magnetic sorting, or FACS. Surface markers for different
types of CSCs in brain [28], breast [29], ovarian [30],
colon [20, 31], lung [32], head and neck [33], pancreas
[34], and liver cancers [35] have been identified. Other
ways to identify CSCs include detecting the expression of
transcription factors and various cytoplasmic and nuclear
proteins, and/or determining functional properties such as
DNA-label retention, dye-efflux properties, or enzymatic
metabolism. However, no single marker can define CSCs,
but the combined use of multiple markers now offers the
potential to identify and define CSCs. Indeed, CSCs share
many characteristics with normal stem cells [36]; therefore,
developing specific agents for targeting and killing CSCs
warrants further research.
Recently, OV-based therapy has attracted attention
because it shows promising results in terms of cancer
selectivity and safety in clinical trials [37–40]. OVs possess
cancer selectivity and efficiently kill cancers because
(i) OVs utilize the EGFR pathway, which is activated in
cancerous cells; (ii) elevated TK in cancer cells promotes
enhanced replication of vTk-deleted OVs; (iii) OV kills
cancer by replicating within the cancer, so that it can be

DISCUSSION
SCCs are tumorigenic and are responsible for the
malignancy and drug resistance of colon cancer cells even
though SCC populations constitute only 0.1–10% of all
tumor cells [21]. The rare subset of cancer cells having
“stem-like” features, namely, CSCs, possess natural
quiescence and a high level of drug efflux transporters,
leading to their low sensitivity to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, compared with normal tumor cells [21–24].
Therefore, the concept has emerged that CSCs represent an
important challenge in the understanding of anticancer drug
resistance, cancer recurrence, and metastasis [25], as well
as CRC treatment. The available conventional therapeutic
agents primarily eliminate the bulk of tumors, but do not
affect CSCs [26, 27]. Therefore, the ability to target and

xenograft models of 106 live monolayer-cultured HT29 cells (mono HT29), sphere-cultured HT29 cells (sphere HT29), sphere HT29 cells
treated with 5-Fu, and HT29 cells treated with CVV showed that CVV can attenuate tumor growth and successfully kill stem cell-like cells
(n = 6–8; *p < 0.05 vs. mono HT29, t test; scale bar = 1 cm). (C) The CD133+/CD44+ double-positive SCCs population (left panel) and realtime PCR results (right panel) show that CVV can highly suppress stem cell-like HT29 cells compared to 5-Fu treatment (n = 3, *p < 0.05).

effectively used at lower concentrations to stop replication
when all the host cancer cells are lysed; and (iv) cancer
cells lysed by an OV can release debris containing tumor
antigens, which triggers the immune system and leads to
cytotoxic T-cell activation and cell-mediated immunity
[41]. Although encouraging results from clinical trials are
beginning to accumulate, the efficacy of using OVs for

SCCs has not been well understood thus far. OVs can be
ideal candidates, as opposed to directly targeting agents for
CSCs, because they are cytotoxic and are not subject to the
typical mechanisms of drug resistance, such as drug-efflux
pumps and defective apoptotic signaling, which suggests
that OVs might be effective against CSCs, including SCCs
[42, 43].

cancer-favoring selectivity and cytotoxicity, thereby enabling it to successfully override drug resistance and/or other limitations of currently
developed targeted therapies in terms of killing colon cancer cells, regardless of the presence of SCCs, because of its cancer-favoring
characteristics and the different cytotoxic pathway used to kill cancer cells.

In this study, efforts were made to develop CVV, a
cancer-favoring oncolytic vaccinia virus, by first evolving
vaccinia virus from the tumor mass and then inactivating
the vTk gene. We next investigated its therapeutic efficacy
in terms of killing SCCs. When applied to various CRC
cell lines, CVV could selectively infect and kill host cells
more efficiently than the wild-type vaccinia virus VR1536.
However, most cells showed anticancer drug resistance,
which is associated with SCC populations and are related
with ABCG2 expression. SCC models were established
by constructing colon cancer sphere cell lines, which
have higher tumorigenicity and can continuously express
stemness markers. As expected, sphere cells remained
susceptible to CVV, but not to chemodrugs. Our CVV also
selectively killed tumor cells in an in vivo mouse model.
Tumor xenografts induced by subcutaneous injection with
HT26 spheres that survived after pretreatment with PBS,
CVV, or 5-Fu showed significantly suppressed tumor
growth, only with CVV treatment. Interestingly, 5-Fu
showed an early response in intraperitoneally injected CT26
mice in terms of suppressing tumor masses and increasing
the survival rates of treated mice, but it was surpassed by
CVV 24 at days post-treatment. Our data also showed that
CVV eventually exhibited greater anti-tumor efficacy,
even after a single, low-dose injection (106 pfu/mouse).
Combined treatment with CVV and 5-Fu further improved
survival rates and led to complete suppression of tumor
mass production in the abdomen. We ascribe this finding
to the early effect of 5-Fu, followed by the late effect of
CVV owing to its replication and mild effect in cancerous
tissue. The early effect of 5-Fu can kill bulk cancer cells,
but SCCs can retain resistance. This issue, however, was
counteracted by CVV. Furthermore, the immune reaction
conferred by cancer cells lysed by CVV may also contribute
to the relatively long-lasting effect of suppressing CSCs.

(Daegu, Korea). The anticancer drugs CPT11 and 5-Fu
were purchased from Sigma Korea (Yongin, Korea).

Sphere formation
Single cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM/
F12 (Welgene) containing 1 × B27 supplement (Invitrogen,
Waltham, MA), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, and
10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (PeproTech,
Rocky Hill, NJ). Primary spheres were derived by plating
50,000 to 100,000 single cells per well into 6-well ultralow attachment dishes (Corning, Corning, NY). Dishes
were cultivated for 7 days prior to in vivo cell injection.

Cell proliferation (cytotoxicity) assay
Cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well
plates. After 1 day, cells were treated with an anticancer
drug or OV at the desired concentration in serum-free media
for 2 h. Then, the media were replaced with normal culture
media. After a 72-h treatment, cell viability was assessed
using the WST Cell Proliferation Assay (EzCytotox,
ITSBIO, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The absorbance of each sample at 450 nm
was measured using a microplate reader. The reference
wavelength used was 680 nm.

Replication assay
Viral replication was quantified using a standard
plaque assay. Cells were plated at 40,000 cells in 24-well
flat-bottom plates in 1 ml of media and incubated at 37°C.
Cells were infected with the virus of interest (WT, EVV,
or CVV) at an MOI of 0.1. Cell lysates were harvested
daily for 3 days and viruses were released by 3 cycles of
freezing and thawing of the cell lysates. Serial dilutions
of each sample were used to infect U2OS cells at 80%
confluency in 6-well plates, and viral titers were determined
by counting viral plaques.

CONCLUSION
The CVV developed in this study can effectively
and selectively infect and replicate in SCCs because it
favors cancer cells and is not affected by drug-resistance
pathways. We conclude that this CVV effectively
suppressed SCCs, which can be synergistically enhanced
by co-treatment with 5-Fu.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). RNA purity was verified by measuring the
ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (A260/280). The
first strand of cDNA was synthesized with 2 μg of total
RNA using the PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Takara Korea, Seoul, Korea), and 1 μL of the cDNA was
used for each PCR mixture containing SYBR-Green qPCR
mix (Roche, BASEL, Switzerland). Real-time PCR was
performed using a LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System
(Roche). The reaction mixtures were subjected to a 40-cycle
amplification at 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C
for 25 s. Relative mRNA expression levels of the selected
genes were normalized to beta-actin mRNA expression and
quantified using the 2−∆∆Ct method. The sequences of the
primers used are shown in Table 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The human colon cancer cells lines HT29, Lovo,
DLD-1, and HCT116, and the mouse colon cancer cell
line CT26 were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank
(Seoul, Korea) and the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and
100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin under standard
conditions of 37°C, 5% CO2, and a humidified atmosphere.

twice per week in the subcutaneous injection model. The
tumor volume was calculated according to the following
formula: tumor volume (mm3) = L × W2/2, where L is
the tumor length and W is the tumor width. The animals
in the intraperitoneal injection model were divided into
4 groups, which received intraperitoneal injection of PBS,
5-Fu (25 mg/kg, 3 times a week), CVV (1 × 106 pfu/mouse,
once a week), and 5-Fu (25 mg/kg, 3 times a week) plus
CVV (106 pfu/mouse, once a week). Mouse survival was
monitored daily during the experimental period. At 4 weeks
post-injection, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were
immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.

FACS analysis and cell sorting were performed using
a FACSCanto II and FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ), respectively. FACS data were
analyzed using FACS Diva software (BD). Antibodies to
the following proteins were used: FITC-conjugated CD44
(MACS, Miltenyi Biotech Korea, Seoul, Korea) and PEconjugated CD133 (BD). FACS gates were established
by staining with isotype-matched PE or FITC conjugated
antibodies (BD).

Immunofluorescence staining

H & E staining and TUNEL assay

Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for fluorescence staining. Samples were permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding was
blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Invitrogen). Staining
was performed using unlabeled primary antibodies and
fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. Stained
samples were examined by fluorescence confocal
microscopy (Olympus IX7; Hicksville, NY).

To assay tumor generation and morphological
characteristics, frozen tumor sections were used for H&E
staining. Images were acquired using an Olympus confocal
microscope. The TUNEL assay was performed on paraffinembedded sections. Commercially available reagents
(DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System; Promega,
Madison, WI) were used to perform the TUNEL analysis.
