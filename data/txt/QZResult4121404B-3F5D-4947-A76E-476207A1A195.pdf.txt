Abstract
Tumors may be initiated and maintained by a cellular
subcomponent that displays stem cell properties. We have
used the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase as assessed by
the ALDEFLUOR assay to isolate and characterize cancer stem
cell (CSC) populations in 33 cell lines derived from normal and
malignant mammary tissue. Twenty-three of the 33 cell lines
contained an ALDEFLUOR-positive population that displayed
stem cell properties in vitro and in NOD/SCID xenografts.
Gene expression profiling identified a 413-gene CSC profile
that included genes known to play a role in stem cell function,
as well as genes such as CXCR1/IL-8RA not previously known
to play such a role. Recombinant interleukin-8 (IL-8)
increased mammosphere formation and the ALDEFLUORpositive population in breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we show
that ALDEFLUOR-positive cells are responsible for mediating
metastasis. These studies confirm the hierarchical organization of immortalized cell lines, establish techniques that
can facilitate the characterization of regulatory pathways
of CSCs, and identify potential stem cell markers and
therapeutic targets. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1302–13]

Introduction
The evolution of a normal cell into a fully transformed one
requires the deregulation of multiple cellular processes (1, 2).
According to classic models of carcinogenesis, these events can
occur in any cell. In contrast, the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis
holds that the preferential targets of oncogenic transformation are
tissue stem or early progenitor cells that have acquired self-renewal
potential (3–6). These tumor-initiating cells or CSCs, in turn, are
characterized by their ability to undergo self-renewal, a process
that drives tumorigenesis and differentiation, which contributes to
tumor cellular heterogeneity. Recent evidence supporting the CSC
hypothesis has been generated using xenografts of primary human
tumors. These studies have suggested that tumors are composed of

a cellular hierarchy driven by the CSC component. In addition,
recent data suggest that immortalized cell lines derived from both
murine and human tissues may also contain a cellular population
displaying stem cell properties. Most of these studies have been
based on in vitro properties, including clonogenic potential, sphere
formation, and multilineage differentiation potential (7–10). More
limited studies using functional transplantation of immortalized
cell lines in xenografts have also suggested the existence of such a
hierarchy. These studies have generally used Hoechst dye exclusion
to identify the so-called side population (SP; refs. 7, 9, 11). In
addition, cell surface markers defined using primary tumor
xenografts, such as CD44 and CD133, have also been used to
identify similar populations in established cell lines (7, 8). However,
the limitations of these techniques have precluded their application across a wide variety of cell lines representing the molecular
heterogeneity of tumors such as breast cancer. In addition, a
crucial question remains as to whether the stem cell components
of cell lines represent a valid model for CSC biology.
To provide more definitive evidence for the existence of CSC
populations within breast cancer cell lines, we have studied the
expression of the stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) in a series of 33 cell lines derived from human breast
cancers and nontransformed breast cells. ALDH is a detoxifying
enzyme responsible for the oxidation of intracellular aldehydes and
is thought to play a role in stem cell differentiation through
metabolism of retinal to retinoic acid (12). ALDH activity, as
assessed by the fluorescent ALDEFLUOR assay, has been successfully used to isolate CSCs in multiple myeloma and acute myeloid
leukemia, as well as from brain tumors (13, 14). We recently showed
that ALDH activity can be used to isolate a subpopulation of cells
that display stem cell properties from normal human breast tissue
and breast carcinomas (15). We now show that the majority of
breast cancer cell lines contain an ALDEFLUOR-positive population with a distinct molecular profile that displays CSC properties.
These studies have important implications for the interpretation of
data using cell lines and suggest that these lines may be useful for
elucidating CSC regulatory pathways.

S. Ethier6 (SUM44, SUM52, SUM149, SUM159, SUM185, SUM190, SUM225,
SUM229), V.J. Möbus (BrCa-MZ-01), and V. Catros (S68). All BCLs tested
were derived from carcinomas, except for MCF10A, which is derived from
fibrocystic disease, and the HMEC-derived 184A1, which was derived from
normal mammary tissue. The cell lines were grown using the recommended
culture conditions (Supplementary Table S1). All experiments were done
with subconfluent cells in the exponential phase of growth.
ALDEFLUOR assay and separation of the ALDH-positive population
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. ALDH activity was assessed in 33
BCLs representing the main molecular subtypes of human breast cancer.
The ALDEFLUOR kit (StemCell Technologies) was used to isolate the
population with high ALDH enzymatic activity using a FACStarPLUS
(Becton Dickinson), as previously described (15). Briefly, cells were
incubated in ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing ALDH substrate
(1 Amol/L per 1  106 cells). In each experiment, a sample of cells was
stained under identical conditions with 50 mmol/L of diethylaminobenzaldehyde, a specific ALDH inhibitor, as negative control. The sorting gates
were established using propidium iodide–stained cells for viability. Before
RNA profiling or NOD/SCID mice injection, the purity of sorted populations
was checked using double sorting of 10,000 ALDEFLUOR-positive and
ALDEFLUOR-negative cells in BrCa-MZ-01 and SUM159 cell lines. For both
cell lines, sorted ALDEFLUOR-positive populations contained >98% of
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells and no ALDEFLUOR-positive cells were detected
in the ALDEFLUOR-negative population.
Tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice. Tumorigenicity of ALDELFUORpositive, ALDELFUOR-negative, and unseparated SUM159, MDA-MB-453,
and BrCa-MZ-01 cells was assessed in NOD/SCID mice. Fat pads were
prepared as described (15).
Anchorage-independent culture. ALDEFLUOR-positive, ALDELFUORnegative, and unseparated cells from 184A1, SUM149, and SUM159 were
plated as single cells in ultralow attachment plates (Corning) at low density
(5,000 viable cells/mL). Cells were grown in serum-free mammary epithelial
basal medium (Cambrex Bio Science) for 3 to 7 d, as described (16). The
capacity of cells to form spheres was quantified after treatment with different
doses of interleukin-8 (IL-8; GenWay Biotech) added to the medium.
RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from frozen ALDEFLUORpositive and ALDEFLUOR-negative cells using DNA/RNA All Prep Maxi kit,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Sample & Assay
Technologies). Eight BCLs were used for transcriptional analysis: 184A1,
BrCa-MZ-01, HCC1954, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-7, SUM149, and
SUM159. RNA integrity was controlled by denaturing formaldehyde agarose
gel electrophoresis and microanalysis (Agilent Bioanalyzer).
Gene expression profiling with DNA microarrays. Gene expression
analyses used Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 human oligonucleotide microarrays
containing over 47,000 transcripts and variants, including 38,500 wellcharacterized human genes. Preparation of cRNA, hybridizations, washes,
and detection were done as recommended by the supplier.7 Expression data
were analyzed by the robust multichip average (RMA) method in R using
Bioconductor and associated packages (17), as described (18). RMA did
background adjustment, quantile normalization, and summarization of 11
oligonucleotides per gene.
Before analysis, a filtering process removed from the data set genes with
low and poorly measured expression as defined by expression value inferior
to 100 units in all the 16 samples, retaining 25,285 genes/ESTs. A second
filter, based on the intensity of SD, was applied for unsupervised analyses to
exclude genes showing low expression variation across the analyses. SD was
calculated on log2-transformed data, in which lowest values were first
floored to a minimal value of 100 units, i.e., the background intensity,
retaining 13,550 genes/ESTs with SD superior to 0.5. An unsupervised
analysis was done on 16 ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative
cells on 13,550 genes. Before hierarchical clustering, filtered data were log2transformed and submitted to the Cluster program (19) using data mediancentered on genes, Pearson correlation as similarity metric, and centroid

linkage clustering. Results were displayed using the TreeView program (19).
To identify and rank genes discriminating ALDEFLUOR-positive and
ALDEFLUOR-negative populations, a Mann-Whitney U test was applied to
the 25,285 genes/ESTs and false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct
the multiple testing hypothesis (see Supplementary Table S2 for complete
data set). The classification power of the discriminator signature was
illustrated by classifying samples by hierarchical clustering. A leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV) was applied to estimate the accuracy of
prediction of the identified molecular signatures and the validity of
supervised analysis; each sample was excluded one by one and classified
with the linear discriminant analysis (20) by using model defined on the
nonexcluded samples.
Real-time reverse transcription–PCR. After ALDEFLUOR-positive and
ALDEFLUOR-negative populations from different cell lines were sorted, total
RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) and used for real-time
quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (qRT-PCR) assays in an ABI PRISM
7900HT sequence detection system with 384-well block module and
automation accessory (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes for
the Taqman system were selected from the Applied Biosystems website.8
The sequences of the PCR primer pairs and fluorogenic probes used
are available on the Applied Biosystems website (CXCR1 assay
ID: Hs_00174146_mi, FBXO21 assay ID: Hs_00372141_mi, NFYA assay ID:
Hs_00953589_mi, NOTCH2 assay ID: Hs_01050719_mi, RAD51L1 assay ID:
Hs00172522_mi, TBP assay ID: Hs_00427620_mi). The relative expression
mRNA level of CXCR1, FBXO21, NFYA, NOTCH2, RAD51L1 was computed with
respect to the internal standard TBP gene to normalize for variations in the
quality of RNA and the amount of input cDNA, as described previously (21).
Invasion assay. Assays were done in triplicate in transwell chambers with
8-Am pore polycarbonate filter inserts for 12-well plates (Corning). Filters
were coated with 30 AL of ice-cold 1:6 basement membrane extract (Matrigel,
BD Bioscience) in DMEM/F12 incubated 1 h at 37jC. Cells were added to the
upper chamber in 200 AL of serum-free medium. For the invasion assay,
5,000 cells were seeded on the Matrigel-coated filters and the lower chamber
was filled with 600 AL of medium supplemented with 10% human serum
(Cambrex) or with 600 AL of serum-free medium supplemented with IL-8 (100
ng/mL). After 48 h of incubation, the cells on the underside of the filter
were counted using light microscopy. Relative invasion was normalized to
the unseparated corresponding cell lines under serum condition.
Lentivirus infection. For luciferase gene transduction, 70% confluent
cells from HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, and SUM159 were incubated overnight
with a 1:3 precipitated mixture of lentiviral supernatants Lenti-LUC-VSVG
(Vector Core) in culture medium. On the following day, the cells were
harvested by trypsin/EDTA and subcultured at a ratio of 1:6. After 1 wk of
incubation, cells were sorted according to the ALDEFLUOR phenotype, and
luciferase expression was verified in each sorted population (ALDEFLUORpositive and ALDEFLUOR-negative) by adding 2 AL D-luciferin 0.0003%
(Promega) in the culture medium and counting photon flux by device
camera system (Xenogen; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Intracardiac inoculation. Six-week-old NOD/SCID mice were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane/air mixture and injected in the left ventricle of the
heart with 100,000 cells in 100 AL of sterile Dulbecco’s PBS lacking Ca2+ and
Mg2+. For each of the three cell lines (HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, SUM159) and
for each population (ALDEFLUOR-positive, ALDEFLUOR-negative, and
unsorted), three animals were injected.
Bioluminescence detection. Baseline bioluminescence was assessed
before inoculation and each week thereafter inoculations. Mice were
anesthetized with a 2% isofluorane/air mixture and given a single i.p. dose
of 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (Promega) in PBS. For photon flux counting, we
used a charge-coupled device camera system (Xenogen) with a nose-cone
isofluorane delivery system and heated stage for maintaining body
temperature. Results were analyzed after 2 to 12 min of exposure using
Living Image software provided with the Xenogen imaging system. Signal
intensity was quantified as the sum of all detected photon flux counts within

Normalized photon flux represents the ratio of the photon flux detected each
week after inoculations and the photon flux detected before inoculation.
Statistical analysis. Results are presented as the mean F SD for at least
three repeated individual experiments for each group. Statistical analyses
used the SPSS software (version 10.0.5). Correlations between sample groups
and molecular variables were calculated with the Fisher’s exact test or the
one-way ANOVA for independent samples. A P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
The majority of BCLs contain an ALDEFLUOR-positive
population. We used the ALDEFLUOR assay (15) to isolate CSC
from 33 BCLs representing the diverse molecular subtypes and

features of breast cancer (ref. 18; Supplementary Fig. S2). As shown
in Fig. 1A, 23 of the 33 cell lines contained an ALDEFLUOR-positive
cell population that ranged from 0.2 to nearly 100%. All 16 basal/
mesenchymal BCLs contained an ALDEFLUOR-positive population, whereas 7 of the 12 luminal BCLs did not contain any
detectable ALDEFLUOR-positive cells (P = 0.0006, Fischer’s exact
test; Fig. 1B).
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells have tumorsphere-forming
capacity. We have previously reported that mammary epithelial
stem and progenitor cells are able to survive and proliferate in
anchorage-independent conditions and form floating spherical
colonies that we termed mammospheres (16). Data from breast
tumors, as well as cell lines, have shown that cancer stem-like cells
or cancer-initiating cells can also be isolated and propagated as

mRNA expression levels. A, the dendrogram of samples represents overall similarities in gene expression profiles. Two large groups of samples are evidenced by
clustering. Name of cell lines is colored as follows: blue for luminal (n = 12), red for basal (n = 10), brown for mesenchymal (n = 6) cell lines according to the correlation
of expression profile of each cell line with each Ross and Perou centroid (i.e., molecular subtype). Five cell lines were not attributed any subtype (name in gray ). The ER,
ERBB2, and ALDEFLUOR status of BCLs are represented according to a color ladder (for ER and ERBB2 status, negative, white; positive, black; unavailable, oblique
feature; for ALDEFLUOR status, a color scale shown at the bottom of the dendrogram relates the percentage of ALDELFUOR-positive cells found in each BCL).
B, comparison of the ALDEFLUOR status with the molecular subtypes of BCLs revealed a strong correlation between the basal/mesenchymal subtypes and the
presence of ALDEFLUOR-positive cells (P = 0.0006).

‘‘tumorspheres’’ in similar assays (22). All mammosphere-initiating
cells in the normal human mammary gland are contained within
the ALDEFLUOR-positive population (15). To characterize the
ALDEFLUOR-positive population from BCLs, we compared the
ability of ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative populations from 184A1, SUM149, and SUM159 to form tumorspheres. In
each cell line, the ALDEFLUOR-positive population showed
increased tumorsphere-forming capacity compared with ALDEFLUOR-negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
ALDEFLUOR-positive BCL cells have CSC properties in vivo.
To determine the hierarchical organization of BCL, we analyzed the
stem cell properties of the ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUORnegative populations of MDA-MB-453, SUM159, and BrCa-MZ-01
cell lines. The ALDEFLUOR-positive populations of these three
BCLs constituted between 3.54 F 1.73% and 5.49 F 3.36% of the
total cell populations (Supplementary Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 2A
and B, the size and latency of tumor formation correlated with the
number of ALDEFLUOR-positive cells injected. Remarkably, 500
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells from MDA-MB-453 and 1,000 ALDEFLUOR-positive cells from SUM159 were able to form tumors. The
tumor-generating capacity was maintained through serial passages
demonstrating the self-renewal capacity of these cells. In contrast,
ALDEFLUOR-negative cells failed to generate tumors, although
limited growth was produced when 50,000 ALDEFLUOR-negative
MDA-MB-453 cells were injected (Supplementary Table S3). H&E

staining of the fat pad sections confirmed that tumors formed by
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells contained malignant cells, whereas only
residual Matrigel, apoptotic cells, and mouse tissue were seen at
the sites of ALDELFUOR-negative cell injections (Fig. 2C and D).
Consistent with the ALDEFLUOR-positive population having CSC
characteristics, tumors generated by this population recapitulated
the phenotypic heterogeneity of the initial tumor, with a similar
ratio of ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). This indicates that ALDEFLUOR-positive
cells were able to self-renew, generating ALDEFLUOR-positive cells,
and were able to differentiate, generating ALDEFLUOR-negative
cells.
When BrCa-MZ-01 cells were separated into ALDEFLUORpositive and ALDEFLUOR-negative components, both were capable
of tumor generation. Tumors generated by the ALDEFLUORpositive population consisted of both ALDEFLUOR-positive and
ALDEFLUOR-negative cells recapitulating the phenotypic heterogeneity of the initial tumor (Supplementary Fig. S5). In contrast,
tumors generated by ALDEFLUOR-negative cells gave rise to slowly
growing tumors containing only ALDEFLUOR-negative cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5F and G). In contrast to the ability of
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells to be serially transplanted, serial
passages of ALDEFLUOR-negative tumors produced decreasing
tumor growth with no growth after three passages. This suggests
that the ALDEFLUOR-positive component of the BrCa-MZ-01 cells

NOTE: The 28 up-regulated genes in ALDEFLUOR-positive population (top) and the 42 down-regulated genes in ALDEFLUOR-positive population
(bottom), common between the 413-gene and the 49-gene signatures (Supplementary Table S2). They are grouped together according to a common
biological function and ranked according to their discriminating score (DS). DS was calculated for each gene as DS = (M1 M2) / (S1 + S2), wherein M1
and S1 respectively represent mean and SD of expression levels of the gene in subgroup 1 and M2 and S2 in subgroup 2. Because of multiple hypotheses
testing, confidence levels were estimated by 100 iterative random permutations of samples as previously described with a false positive rate of 1/1.000
(50). Underlined genes are cited in the text (Results and Discussion).
*Follows the name of genes found in the 49-gene signature.

contain cells with stem cell properties, whereas the ALDEFLUORnegative cells contain progenitor cells able to undergo limited
growth but not self-renewal.
Gene expression profiling of ALDELFUOR-positive and
ALDELFUOR-negative cell populations. To determine whether
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells isolated from different BCLs expressed
a common set of CSC genes, we analyzed ALDEFLUOR-positive
and ALDEFLUOR-negative cell populations isolated from eight
BCLs (184A1, BrCa-MZ-01, HCC1954, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453,
SK-BR-7, SUM49, and SUM159) by using Affymetrix whole-genome
oligonucleotide microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering,
applied to the 16 samples and the 13,550 filtered genes/ESTs, did
not separate ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative
populations (not shown). Instead, ALDEFLUOR-positive and
ALDEFLUOR-negative populations clustered with the parental cell
line. This suggests that the differences in mRNA transcripts
between clonal cell lines supersede differences between ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative cells. This further
suggests that only a limited number of genes are differentially
expressed between putative CSCs and their progeny.
To determine which genes discriminated ALDEFLUOR-positive
and ALDEFLUOR-negative populations, the Mann-Whitney U test
was applied to all genes but those with low and poorly measured
expression, i.e., 25,285 probe sets. This test identified and ranked,
after FDR correction, 413 genes/ESTs that discriminated the
ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative cell populations.
The 28 overexpressed genes corresponding to unique genes and the
most frequently underexpressed genes are shown in Table 1 (top
and bottom). The classification power of this discriminating
signature was illustrated by classifying the 16 ALDEFLUOR-positive

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

and ALDEFLUOR-negative samples with the 413 differentially
expressed genes/ESTs. Hierarchical clustering ranked 15 of the 16
samples (Supplementary Fig. S6).
A number of genes known to play a role in stem cell biology were
up-regulated in the ALDEFLUOR-positive populations (Table 1,
top), including NFYA, NOTCH2, PCNX, RBM15, ST3GAL3, and
TPRXL. Other genes encode proteins that have putative or
uncharacterized role in stem cell function, such as ARID1B,
RAD51L1, and the chemokine receptor CXCR1/IL-8RA (23). Genes
underexpressed in the ALDEFLUOR-positive population are
involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis, RNA splicing, and
mitochondrial metabolism.
To increase the stringency of analysis, we raised the threshold of
the Mann-Whitney analysis to the 0.5 risk and obtained a list of 49
genes/ESTs that discriminated ALDELFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative populations (Table 1, genes with asterisk). With
this list, all of the ALDEFLUOR-positive cells, except from SK-BR-7,
clustered together (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Among these 49
genes/ESTS, 45 corresponded to identified unique genes; only 3 of
these 45 were overexpressed in the ALDEFLUOR-positive group
whereas 42 were underexpressed. Characterized overexpressed
genes code for an F-box protein FBXO21 and CXCR1/IL-8RA.
Underexpressed genes include those coding for mitochondrial
ribosomal proteins (MRPL41, MRPL42, MRPL47, MRPL54, MRPS23,
IMMP1L), and differentiation (NACA) and pre-mRNA splicing
factors (LSM3, pre-mRNA processing factor PRPF39, and PRPF4B).
LOOCV at 0.5% risk estimated the accuracy of prediction of the
identifier molecular signature, and 88% of the samples were
predicted in the right class with this CSC signature confirming the
supervised analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7B and C).

qRT-PCR assessment confirmed a significant increase of
CXCR1 and FBXO21 in ALDEFLUOR-positive cells. We performed
qRT-PCR analysis of five discriminator genes overexpressed in
ALDEFLUOR-positive populations (CXCR1/IL-8RA, FBXO21, NFYA,
NOTCH2, and RAD51L1). Three cell lines used in the profiling
analysis (BrCa-MZ-01, MDA-MB-453, SUM159) and two additional
luminal cell lines (MCF7, S68) were sorted by ALDEFLUOR assay, and
ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative populations were
processed separately for qRT-PCR analysis. The qRT-PCR expression
level of CXCR1 and FBXO21 are presented in Fig. 3A and B. Analyses
of NFYA, NOTCH2, and RAD51L1 are presented in Supplementary
Fig. S8. Gene expression levels measured by qRT-PCR confirmed the
results obtained using DNA microarrays with an increase of CXCR1
and FBXO21 mRNA level in the ALDEFLUOR-positive population
compared with the ALDEFLUOR-negative population (P < 0.05).
IL-8 promotes CSC self-renewal. Our profiling studies
suggested that the IL-8 receptor CXCR1/IL-8RA was consistently
expressed in the ALDEFLUOR-positive cell population. To confirm
this association, we measured the protein expression of CXCR1/
IL-8RA by flow cytometry in ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative populations. The ALDEFLUOR-positive and
ALDEFLUOR-negative populations from four different cell lines
were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, fixed, and
stained with a CXCR1 monoclonal antibody labeled with
phycoerythrin. ALDEFLUOR-positive cells were highly enriched
in CXCR1-positive cells compared with the ALDEFLUOR-negative
populations (Supplementary Fig. S9).

To determine whether IL-8 signaling is important in stem cell
function, we treated four BCLs with human recombinant IL-8 and
determined its effect on the CSC population, as measured by the
formation of tumorspheres and by ALDH enzymatic activity. As
shown in Fig. 4A, addition of IL-8 increased the formation of
primary and secondary tumorspheres in a dose-dependent manner.
Furthermore, IL-8 increased the ALDEFLUOR-positive population
in a dose-dependent manner in each of the four BCLs analyzed
(Fig. 4B). This illustrates the power of the CSC signature to identify
pathways that may play a role in the stem cell function.
The IL8/CXCR1 axis is involved in CSC invasion. The IL8/
CXCR1 axis has been reported to play a role in CSC invasion (24, 25).
We first used a Matrigel invasion assay, using serum as attractant,
to examine the ability of ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUORnegative cell populations from three different cell lines (HCC1954,
MDA-MB-453, SUM159) to invade. As shown in Fig. 5A, ALDEFLUOR-positive cells showed 6-fold to 20-fold higher invasion
through Matrigel than the ALDEFLUOR-negative population (P <
0.01). When used as a chemoattractant, IL-8 (100 ng/mL) increased
invasion of the ALDEFLUOR-positive cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A). In
contrast to its effects on ALDEFLUOR-positive cells, IL-8 did not
have any effect on the invasive capacity of ALDELFLUOR-negative
cells. These results indicate that CSCs exhibited invasive behavior
and, furthermore, that IL-8 facilitates this process.
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells have increased metastatic
potential. It has been proposed that CSCs play a crucial role in
cancer metastasis (26, 27). The above experiments showed that

qRT-PCR. A and B, to confirm our gene expression
results, we measured in a set of five breast cancer cell lines
sorted for the ALDEFLUOR phenotype the expression of
five discriminator genes overexpressed in ALDEFLUORpositive populations (CXCR1/IL-8RA, FBXO21, NFYA,
NOTCH2, and RAD51L1) by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR
expression levels of CXCR1 and FBXO21 are presented
here and the ones of NFYA, NOTCH2 , and RAD51L1 are
presented in Supplementary Fig. S8. Gene expression
levels measured by qRT-PCR confirm the results obtained
using DNA microarrays with an increase of CXCR1 and
FBXO21 mRNA level in the ALDEFLUOR-positive
population compared with the ALDEFLUOR-negative
population (P < 0.05).

ALDEFLUOR-positive cells have increased invasive capacity
compared with ALDEFLUOR-negative cells. To determine the
relationship between ALDEFLUOR positivity and metastatic
capacity, we infected HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, and SUM159 with
a luciferase lentivirus reporter system. Luciferase-infected cells
were sorted using the ALDEFLUOR assay and introduced to NOD/
SCID mice by intracardiac injection. A suspension of 100,000 cells
from each population was injected, and metastasis was assessed by
bioluminescent imaging. Mice inoculated with ALDEFLUORpositive cells developed metastases at different sites and displayed
a higher photon flux emission than mice inoculated with
unseparated cells, which developed no more than one metastasis
per mouse, or mice inoculated with ALDEFLUOR-negative cells,
which developed only occasional metastases limited to lymph nodes
(Fig. 5B and C and Supplementary Fig. S10). Histologic sections
confirmed the presence of metastases at these sites (Fig. 5C).
Thus, the metastatic capacity of BCLs is predominantly mediated
by CSCs contained in the ALDEFLUOR-positive population.

Discussion
The hypothesis that tumors are organized in a cellular hierarchy
driven by CSCs has fundamental implications for cancer biology, as
well as clinical implications for the early detection, prevention, and
treatment of cancer. Evidence for CSCs has largely relied on
primary and early passage xenograft models (28, 29). However, the
success of establishing breast tumor xenograft has been low
particularly for certain molecular subtypes. In contrast to primary
tumors, cell lines are available in unlimited quantities and provide
only carcinomatous populations for molecular analysis without

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

normal tissue and stroma. In breast cancer, a large number of
immortalized cell lines have been produced, which represent the
different molecular subtypes found in primary human breast
cancers (2, 18). However, a fundamental question remains as to
how closely these cell lines are able to recapitulate the biology of
human breast cancer.
In vivo evidence for stem cells in cell lines. Recent studies have
suggested that although cell lines may be clonally derived, they
contain a cellular hierarchy representing different stages of cellular
differentiation. Several studies have used markers, such as CD44+/
CD24 to identify CSC within breast cancer cell lines. However,
their utility is limited by the observation that, frequently, a large
percentage of cells within a cell line express these putative stem cell
markers. For example, >90% of cells in basal breast cancer cell lines
display the CD44+/CD24 phenotype. Indeed, the CD44+/CD24
phenotype did not isolate the tumorigenic population of these cell
lines (8). An alternative approach has been to use the SP from cell
lines. However, functional studies using Hoechst staining are limited
by the toxicity of this agent (30). There is also evidence that the
functional stem cell activity is not contained within the SP (31).
ALDH activity assessed by the ALDEFLUOR assay isolates cells
with stem cell properties from various cancers (13). We show here
that 23 of 33 BCLs (predominantly basal cell lines) contain an
ALDEFLUOR-positive population. Lack of an ALDEFLUOR-positive
population in some luminal BCLs may indicate that these luminal
BCLs are derived from ALDEFLUOR-negative progenitor cells.
We used in vivo assays in NOD/SCID mice to show the stem cell
properties of the ALDEFLUOR-positive populations. Self-renewal
was shown by serial passage in NOD/SCID mice, and differentiation was shown by the ability of ALDEFLUOR-positive but not

Figure 5. ALDEFLUOR-positive cells display increased metastatic potential. A, the IL-8/CXCR1 axis is involved in CSC invasion. The role of the IL-8/CXCR1 axis in
invasion was assessed by a Matrigel invasion assay using serum or IL-8 as attractant for three different cell lines (HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, SUM159). ALDEFLUORpositive cells were 6-fold to 20-fold more invasive than ALDEFLUOR-negative cells (P < 0.01). When using IL-8 (100 ng/mL) as attractant, we observed a significant
increase of ALDEFLUOR-positive cells invading through Matrigel compared with serum as attractant (P < 0.05). In contrast, IL-8 had no effect on the invasive capacity
of the ALDEFLUOR-negative population. B and C, the ALDEFLUOR-positive population displayed increased metastatic potential. Ba–c, quantification of the
normalized photon flux measured at weekly intervals after inoculation of 100,000 luciferase-infected cells from each group (ALDEFLUOR-positive, ALDEFLUORnegative, unseparated). Mice inoculated with ALDEFLUOR-positive cells developed several metastasis localized at different sites (bone, muscle, lung, soft tissue) and
displayed a higher photon flux emission than mice inoculated with unseparated cells, which developed no more than one metastasis per mouse. In contrast, mice
inoculated with ALDEFLUOR-negative cells developed only an occasional small metastasis, which was limited to lymph nodes. C, histologic confirmation, by H&E

ALDEFLUOR-negative cells to regenerate the cellular heterogeneity
of the initial tumor.
A breast CSC signature. Utilizing eight BCLs, we identified 413
genes whose expression discriminates ALDEFLUOR-positive and
ALDEFLUOR-negative cells. This signature contained a number of
genes known to play a role in stem cell biology. Genes overexpressed in the ALDEFLUOR-positive population include NOTCH2
(Notch homologue 2), which regulates self-renewal and differentiation of mammary stem cells (16, 32); NFYA, known to regulate
self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells (33); pecanex
homologue PCNX, RBM15/OTT, which plays a pleiotropic role in
hematopoietic stem cells (34) and affects myeloid differentiation
via NOTCH signaling (35); and homeobox-like factor TPRXL
involved in embryonic development, ST3GAL3, which codes for a
stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 synthase, associated with fetal
development and renal and gastric carcinogenesis (36). Notably,
stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 protein (SSEA-4) is expressed in
stem cell populations, such as CXCR4+/CD133+/CD34+/lin stem
cells in human cord blood and quiescent mammary stem cells (37).
Genes underexpressed in the ALDEFLUOR-positive population
are involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial

www.aacrjournals.org

oxidation. They include genes coding for nascent polypeptideassociated complex a subunit NACA, programmed death proteins
PDCD5 and PDCD10, mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPL41,
which induces apoptosis through P53-dependent and P53-independent manner via BCL2 and caspases, and proteins involved in
mitochondrial processes, such as oxidative phosphorylation
(NDUFA2, ATP5J2, IMMP1L) and protein synthesis in the
mitochondrion (MRPL42, MRPL47, MRPL54, MRPS23). Downregulation of apoptotic genes in CSCs may play a role in the
resistance of these cells to radiation and chemotherapy (38).
ALDH1A1 was not identified as a differentially expressed gene in
the ALDEFLUOR-positive signature. However, examination of gene
expression profile of individual BCLs revealed that, although some
showed differential expression of ALDH1A1 in the ALDEFLUORpositive population, others showed differential expression of
ALDH1A3, a different ALDH isoform in this population. This
suggests that the expression of different ALDH isoforms could
contribute to the ALDEFLUOR-positive phenotype.
From chemokines to stemokines. The expression of CXCR1, a
receptor for IL-8, is increased in a variety of cancers (39, 40).
Although IL-8 expression is associated with ER-negative breast

cancer (41), this chemokine has not previously been reported to
play a role in stem cell function. Its implication in the regulation of
growth and metastasis is well-established in androgen-independent
prostate cancer (42). Furthermore, the expression level of IL-8 is
associated with tumorigenicity and metastasis through vascular
endothelial growth factor production and angiogenesis (43, 44). We
validated the gene expression data in three ways. First, qRT-PCR
analysis confirmed a significant increase of CXCR1 mRNA in
ALDEFLUOR-positive populations from cell lines both included
and not included in profiling analysis. Second, we showed, using
flow cytometry, that CXCR1-containing cells were found exclusively
within the ALDEFLUOR-positive population. Third, recombinant
IL-8 increased mammosphere formation and the percentage of
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells in BCLs. The IL-8/CXCR1 axis may,
thus, regulate mammary stem cell proliferation or self-renewal.
Because endothelial and stromal cells secrete IL-8, this chemokine
may play a role in mediating interactions between tumor stem cells
and the tumor microenvironment.
Recent studies have suggested a role for interleukins/chemokines in the regulation of CSCs (45, 46). This includes a role for IL-6
in breast CSCs and IL-4 in mediating chemoresistance of colon
CSCs (46–48). These factors may be involved in the association
between inflammation and cancer. This also includes a role for
CCL5 (RANTES), a chemokine secreted by mesenchymal stem cells,
which acts as a paracrine factor to enhance breast cancer cell
motility, invasion, and metastasis (45).
The roots of metastasis. CSCs may be responsible for
mediating tumor metastasis. A link between CSC and metastasis

was first suggested with the identification of stem cell genes in an
11-gene signature generated using comparative profiles of metastatic and primary tumors in a transgenic mouse model of prostate
cancer and in cancer patients (49). This signature was also a
powerful predictor of disease recurrence, death after therapy, and
distant metastasis in a variety of cancer types. We have shown that
ALDEFLUOR-positive cells are more metastatic than ALDEFLUORnegative cells and that IL-8, previously reported to play a role in
tumor metastasis, promotes the invasion and chemotaxis of CSCs,
which preferentially express the IL-8 receptor CXCR1. The ability to
isolate metastatic CSC from cell lines should facilitate studies of
the molecular mechanisms by which CSCs mediate tumor
metastasis.
