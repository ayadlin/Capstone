BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are rational
targets for therapy in hepatocellular cancer (HCC). METHODS: Patients with histologically proven HCC and not amenable to curative or liver directed therapy were included in this 2-stage phase 2 trial. Eligibility included an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 and Child’s Pugh score of A or B, and 1 prior
systemic therapy. Patients received erlotinib 150 mg daily and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 every 28
days. Objective tumor response was the primary end point. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with advanced HCC
(median age, 60 years) were enrolled in this multi-institutional study. The proportion of patients with Child’s A
classification was 74%. One patient had a confirmed partial response and 11 (48%) achieved stable disease. Median
time to disease progression was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-7.1). Median survival time was 9.5
months (95% CI, 7.1-17.1). Grade 3 toxicities included rash, hypertension, fatigue, and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: In this
trial, erlotinib combined with bevacizumab had minimal activity in patients with advanced HCC based on
objective response and progression-free survival. The role of targeting EGFR and VEGF in HCC needs further

INTRODUCTION

Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the most common primary neoplasm of the liver, accounting for approximately
half a million deaths annually worldwide.1 The rising incidence in the United States, as well as in other parts of the western
world and Japan, is largely attributed to a significant increase in the prevalence of hepatitis C-related chronic liver disease.2
Choice of treatment for patients with HCC largely depends on the stage of the disease, presence or absence of chronic liver
disease, and degree of hepatic dysfunction. Unfortunately, most patients with HCC are not candidates for curative treatments because of large and multicentric tumors, macrovascular invasion, or extrahepatic spread at the time of diagnosis.
Conventional cytotoxic therapy has been disappointing and associated with significant toxicity.3,4
Among the most prominent pathologic and radiologic features of HCC in addition to its multicentricity is its hypervascularity and early invasion of vascular structures. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most potent and
specific of angiogenic growth factors, and its expression is increased in surgical specimens of HCC compared with nontumoral liver tissue.5-8 The degree of VEGF expression has also been shown to increase according to disease stage and
histologic tumor grade.9-11
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands EGF and TGF-alpha are important in cell proliferation, as
well as motility, adhesion, invasion, survival, and angiogenesis.12 EGFR is actively expressed in human hepatoma cell
lines, and EGF is a potent mitogen in these cells.13-15 There is also an increased coexpression of TGF-alpha and EGFR

that occurs frequently in human HCC. In addition,
evidence supports a role for hepatitis C virus (HCV) core
proteins to directly activate the MAP kinase cascade downstream of EGFR and to prolong its activity in response to
mitogenic stimuli in HCV-infected liver cells.16
The multiplicity and complexity of molecular aberrations in HCC necessitates a rational multitargeted
approach in therapy. In addition to the VEGF-VEGFR
pathway, other signaling molecules may be considered as
rational targets for new drug development in HCC. The
role of EGFR in HCC’s pathogenesis and the early
clinical reports of the potential benefit of targeting
EGFR-mediated signaling prompted further development of this class of agents in HCC. The studies by Philip
et al17 and Thomas et al18 demonstrated a potential benefit for erlotinib in disease stabilization in patients with
advanced HCC. The early reports of single-agent bevacizumab inducing regression of vascularity and tumor
growth in advanced HCC19 were proof of principle in targeting VEGF in HCC. The current study was therefore
built on experiences from these pilot trials in advanced
HCC that tested single-agent activities of either erlotinib
or bevacizumab. In addition to the multitargeted
approach using bevacizumab with erlotinib, there was
evidence from preclinical models to support an antiangiogenic effect by targeting the EGFR pathway that would
potentiate the effect of bevacizumab.26
Taken together, preclinical evidence on the role of
EGFR and VEGF/VEGFR in the pathogenesis of HCC
and the early reports of activities of anti-EGFR17,18 and
anti-VEGF/VEGFR19,20 drugs in patients with advanced
HCC provided a rationale for investigating the dual inhibition of angiogenesis and EGFR as a multitargeted treatment in patients with advanced HCC. The primary
objective of this study was to evaluate the response rate of
the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients
with advanced HCC in a multi-institutional setting.

there should have been >6 weeks since that therapy with
indicator lesion(s) outside the area of treatment or, if the
only indicator lesion was within the treatment area, there
must have been definite evidence of disease progression.
Patients must have completed any prior major surgery
(eg, laparotomy) 4 weeks prior to registration and
minor surgery (eg, insertion of indwelling vascular device)
2 weeks prior to registration and recovered from all
surgery-related complications. Eligibility included the following laboratory parameters: absolute neutrophil count
1500/lL, platelet count 75,000/mm3, total serum bilirubin level  upper limit of normal range (ULN), serum
albumin 2.5 g/dL, serum AST/ALT 2.5  ULN,
alkaline phosphatase 5 ULN, INR 1.2, and serum creatinine <2 mg/dL. Excluded from the study were patients
who received prior treatment with either an anti-VEGF/
VEGFR or anti-EGFR drug or who had another malignancy with the exceptions of adequately treated basal cell
or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or
adequately treated stage 1 or 2 cancer from which the
patient was in complete remission. Patients were also
excluded if they received prior radioembolization when
liver only target lesions were present or if they had a history of a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic
attack <6 months prior to registration, uncontrolled
hypertension, unstable angina pectoris within 6 months,
symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction 6 months prior to registration, serious uncontrolled
cardiac arrhythmias, or gastrointestinal bleeding that
required procedural intervention (eg, variceal banding)
within 3 months prior to registration. No active bleeding
or pathologic conditions that carried a high risk of bleeding (eg, tumor involving major vessels, gastroesophageal
ulceration, or esophageal varices) were allowed. The institutional human investigation review boards of all participating institutions approved the study, and all patients
provided a signed informed consent.

Treatment
Bevacizumab 10 mg/Kg was administered intravenously
on days 1 and 15. Erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily was
administered on a continuous basis. Treatment cycles

any of the drugs for any reason, the cycle days continued
to be counted as if the drug(s) were administered. Only
the dose of erlotinib was modified for toxicity to 100 mg
or 50 mg per day. Patients in whom one agent was held
continued to receive the other agent. Treatment was

continued until disease progression, undue toxicity, or
consent withdrawal by the patient. Subjects were withdrawn from the study if they failed to recover to grade 0-1
or tolerable grade 2 (or within 1 grade of pretreatment
toxicity) from a treatment-related toxicity within 14 days
or they experienced agent-related adverse events requiring
dose modification despite 2 previous dose reductions.
Disease Assessment
Objective response to therapy was assessed using the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).21 Measurable disease was defined as one or
more lesions whose longest diameter could be accurately
measured as >2.0 cm. Computerized tomography (CT)
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure response to therapy and repeated every 8 weeks,
unless clinically indicated. Total disappearance of target
lesions constituted a complete response (CR), whereas a
minimum of a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest
diameter (LD) of the lesions was classified as a partial
response (PR). New lesions or a 20% increase in the sum
of the LDs of the target lesions was considered progressive
disease (PD). Otherwise, patients were classified as having
stable disease (SD). Patients were reevaluated for disease
status after a minimum of 4 weeks of achieving a CR or
PR to confirm the assessment. Similarly, an SD was reassessed at a minimum interval of 8 weeks. Patients with
global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease
progression at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions, were considered to
have PD due to symptomatic deterioration.
Time to progression (TTP) was calculated from
study entry to disease progression. Time to death (ie, survival) was calculated from the date of study entry to death
or last contact. Time to treatment failure was defined to
be the time from the date of registration to the date at
which the patient was removed from treatment.
Toxicity Assessment
All patients who underwent protocol-based therapy were
considered eligible for toxicity assessment. Evaluations
were based on at least once per cycle clinical assessments
and graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3.0.
Statistical Methods
The primary end point of the study was objective
response. The point estimate of the success rate was calcu-

2426

lated as the number of successes (CR þ PR) divided by
the number of evaluable patients, with a confidence interval (CI) calculated by the method of Duffy and Santner.22
All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who signed a
consent form, began treatment, and had at least 1 postbaseline disease assessment were evaluable for response.
The largest success proportion considered ineffective was
10% (ie, Ha: P  10%), whereas the smallest success proportion considered effective was 25% (ie, Ha: P  25%).
The decision criteria for the efficacy of this treatment
strategy in this patient population were based on a Flemming22 phase 2 study design with a planned interim analysis. If 9 successes were observed in 50 evaluable patients,
this dual-agent strategy warranted further studies in larger
groups of patients. The planned interim analysis occurred
at the time the 21st patient became evaluable. Here, at
most 2 observed successes would close the trial due to
insufficient evidence of activity. Six successes were considered sufficient evidence of activity to recommend further
testing in larger groups of patients. This study design
yielded 87% power at .06 level of significance to detect a
success rate of at least 25% if the true success rate was at
most 10%. Secondary end points included adverse events
associated with the study therapy, time to disease progression, duration of response, and time to treatment failure.
The distributions of survival time, time to progression,
and time to treatment failure were estimated using the
method of Kaplan-Meier. Two-sided P-values .05 were
considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between October 2006 and March 2008, 27 patients with
advanced HCC were accrued onto the study by the 6
membership institutions. Baseline patient characteristics
are presented in Table 1. A majority of patients were male
(74%) and white (78%) with a median age of 60 years
(range, 36-79 years). Twenty (74%) patients had Child’s
Pugh Classification A (vs B). Sixteen (59%) patients had
ECOG PS of 0. Twelve (44%) patients received prior surgery related to their tumor, 7 (26%) received liver directed
therapy (transarterial chemoembolization [TACE] in 6
patients, and TACE and cryoablation in 1 patient), and
1 (4%) received systemic therapy (CCI-779). Fifty-six
percent of patients had a history of chronic liver disease,
and the majority had HCV infection. Seventy percent
of patients had distant metastases including liver

Primary Efficacy End Point
The primary end point of this study was objective
response using the RECIST (Table 2). Twenty-three
(85%) patients were evaluable for objective response
assessment. Four patients were inevaluable because they
were off the study prior to first radiologic evaluation for
objective response. One patient, a 68-year-old white
female, demonstrated a PR with reduction of serum
a-fetoprotein levels after 3 cycles, which was confirmed at
the next disease assessment; thereafter, treatment was concluded during the 10th cycle due to grade 3 diarrhea that
was poorly controlled. The estimated success rate based
on this number of confirmed responses was 5% (95% CI,
0%-23%). Eleven (48%; 95% CI, 27%-69%) and 11
(48%; 95% CI, 27%-69%) patients had a best response
of either stable disease or disease progression, respectively.
Secondary Efficacy End Points
Twenty-one (78%) patients experienced disease progression. Sites of progression included liver (9 patients), lung
(7 patients), lymph nodes (4 patients), abdominal mass (1
patient), bone (1 patient), brain (1 patient), and other (2
patients). Median time to disease progression was 3.0
months (95% CI, 1.8-7.1 months). Forty-five percent,
35%, and 15% of patients were progression free at 4, 6,
and 9 months, respectively. Eighty-five percent, 73%, and
58% of patients were alive after 4, 6, and 9 months,
respectively. Median survival was 9.5 months (95%CI,
7.1-17.1) with a median follow-up of 23.4 months (range,
1.8-29.1 months). The distributions of time to progression and overall survival are shown in Figure 1. Five of the
patients died without documentation of progressive disease, and the other patient remained alive without
progression.
Treatment Administration
Twenty-seven patients completed a total of 108 cycles of
treatment (median, 2 cycles; range, 1-12 cycles). Patients
received a median of 72% (range, 21%-108%) of the
planned dose of erlotinib, with 11 patients having 14
cycles of dose reductions. Bevacizumab was held in 4
patients for 6 cycles and 10 patients for 13 cycles on days
1 and 15, respectively. Erlotinib was held during 20 cycles
in 16 patients. The estimated time to treatment failure

was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.8-4.6 months). Events precluding further study treatment included disease progression (59%), adverse reactions (15%), refusal (11%), and

discretion [2 patients]).
Toxicity
All patients were evaluable for adverse event analysis
(Table 3). The maximum grade of treatment-related
adverse events was 3 and experienced by 15 (58%) of
patients. The most common toxicities included (grade
1/2/3): rash (6/8/6 patients), hypertension (3/4/1

patients). A 79-year-old white female died of acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia that was considered unrelated to the study drugs, occurring day 81 during the
treatment cycle, after having received full bevacizumab
and 75% of planned erlotinib.

DISCUSSION
The majority of patients with HCC present with incurable disease with a median survival of <1 year because of
lack of effective systemic therapies. Recognition of the
hypervascular nature of HCC stimulated the search for
antiangiogenesis strategies against this disease. The only
drug that has proven to prolong survival in a prospective
randomized phase 3 setting (SHARP and Asia-Pacific
trials) is sorafenib, which targets VEGFR and Raf
kinase.24,25 The efficacy of sorafenib underscored the
potential benefits of targeting the VEGF/VEGFR pathway in HCC as a platform for further development of
targeted therapies. Nevertheless, the modest benefit that
was demonstrated indicated the need to develop further
therapies targeting other signaling pathways known to be
activated in this disease.
Results of this study demonstrated lack of an apparent clinically useful antitumor activity for the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab as measured by
RECIST and time to disease progression. The response
rate of 4% and the time to progression of 3.0 months
were within the range of what was seen with erlotinib
alone17 and inferior to that of bevacizumab.19 One challenge to the interpretation of the results of this study is the
choice of the primary end point that was used in the
design of this trial. It is well recognized that objective
response is difficult to determine with certainty in HCC
and hence may be an inadequate surrogate for survival.
The lack of a relation between improvement in tumor
shrinkage and prolongation of survival was confirmed by
the randomized phase 3 trails of sorafenib. However, the
progression-free survival was significantly improved with
sorafenib when compared with placebo, suggesting that it
may be a better surrogate for overall survival. In the
current study, progression-free survival of 3.0 months was
similar to the placebo arm of the SHARP trial and was
significantly lower than that reported for bevacizumab
single-agent experience.19
The results of this study, when put in the context of
reported outcomes of other studies, highlight the issues of
patient selection in a disease with marked heterogeneity in
etiologic factors. The marked heterogeneity in eligibility

criteria, especially with respect to tumor burden and background liver disease, coupled by the lack of standard clinical practices with respect to the use of systemic agents in
relation to liver directed therapies challenges the ability to
extrapolate results from one study to another. In this
respect, results of this study must be put in the context of
a study recently reported by Thomas et al27 from MD
Anderson Cancer Center using a similar dose and schedule of the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab and
also with the outcome of the SHARP and Asia-Pacific

trials discussed previously. The reported objective
response rate of 25%, median progression-free survival of
9 months, and median survival time of 15.7 months in
the MD Anderson Cancer Center study were superior to
what was seen in the current study. A 110-patient phase 2
randomized trial (NCT00881751) is now ongoing, testing sorafenib versus bevacizumab and erlotinib. Unlike
the MD Anderson Cancer Center single institution experience, the current study has the advantage of being a multicenter study with a population of patients more similar
to what is seen at cancer centers throughout the US. The
differences in outcome may also be explained by higher
proportion of patients with Child’s A disease (87.5% vs
74%) and extrahepatic disease (69% vs 78%) in the MD
Anderson Cancer Center study. Another major difference
between the 2 studies is the higher percentage of patients
with HCV infection compared with the MD Anderson
Cancer Center population (37% vs 25%). There is some
evidence to indicate activation of the Raf/MEK/Erk pathway downstream of EGFR by HCV16 that may reduce the
benefit of erlotinib in HCV-infected patients. It is noteworthy that an unplanned analysis of the SHARP data
suggested an improvement in survival in the HCV subgroup when compared with the overall study population
by using sorafenib that inhibits the Raf kinase.
In conclusion, this multicenter phase 2 study did
not demonstrate a signal of activity for the combination of
bevacizumab and erlotinib that may be considered clinically worthwhile in patients with advanced HCC. Further
work must be undertaken to determine the role of combined anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF/VEGFR treatment
