Abstract:
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common, usually lethal disease with
a median survival of only ~15 months. It has proven resistant in clinical trials
to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel that are highly effective in vitro,
presumably because of impaired drug delivery across the tumor’s blood-brain barrier
(BBB). In an effort to increase paclitaxel delivery across the tumor BBB, we linked
the drug to a novel filomicelle nanocarrier made with biodegradable poly(ethyleneglycol)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone-r-D,L-lactide) and used precisely collimated
radiation therapy (RT) to disrupt the tumor BBB’s permeability in an orthotopic mouse
model of GBM. Using a non-invasive bioluminescent imaging technique to assess
tumor burden and response to therapy in our model, we demonstrated that the drugloaded nanocarrier (DLN) alone was ineffective against stereotactically implanted
intracranial tumors yet was highly effective against GBM cells in culture and in tumors
implanted into the flanks of mice. When targeted cranial RT was used to modulate
the tumor BBB, the paclitaxel-loaded nanocarriers became effective against the
intracranial tumors. Focused cranial RT improved DLN delivery into the intracranial
tumors, significantly improving therapeutic outcomes. Tumor growth was delayed
or halted, and survival was extended by >50% (p<0.05) compared to the results
obtained with either RT or the DLN alone. Combinations of RT and chemotherapeutic
agents linked to nanocarriers would appear to be an area for future investigations
that could enhance outcomes in the treatment of human GBM.

INTRODUCTION

due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) –
specifically the BBB within the tumor. Modulation of both
drug delivery and the integrity of the BBB thus represent
promising strategies for enhancing treatment efficacy.
Solid tumors often have vascular systems that are
leaky and have impaired blood flow compared to the
circulation through normal tissue. Structural characteristics
of tumor vascularity such as increased tortuosity,
irregular shape and dilation of blood vessels coupled
with endothelial fenestrations result in leakage of blood
plasma macromolecules and drugs into tumor tissue. The
extravasation of these plasma macromolecules into tumors
and their concentration and retention within the tumor is
a phenomenon referred to as the enhanced permeability

Over 20,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [1]. Standard treatment
usually consists of surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and
temozolomide chemotherapy, but median survival is only
about 14.6 months [2]. Given these unsatisfactory results,
new therapeutic approaches are clearly needed. Although
other chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel (Taxol)
are even more effective against GBM cells in vitro than
temozolomide [3], they have been found to be clinically
ineffective against GBM [4]. The limited efficacy of
such drugs has been attributed to an inability to achieve
therapeutic concentrations of these drugs in the tumor

in pre-clinical models with some success, including the
use of focused ultrasound as well as vascular-active
agents like TNF-alpha that appear to preferentially
enhance tumor-BBB disruption to facilitate the delivery
of chemotherapeutics [7, 10, 20]. Another such approach
is targeted radiation therapy (RT) which offers an ideal
solution for focally disrupting the tumor BBB while
minimizing disruption of the adjacent normal brain’s BBB
as RT directed at intracranial targets modulates the BBB
with specificity by causing endothelial cell dysfunction
only within the radiation portal [21-27].
RT targeting of tumors has become increasingly
precise in recent years with rapid advances in imaging,
computer modeling, beam generation, and conformal
dose delivery. The safety record of RT also spans many
decades; most patients with solid malignancies now
undergo RT at some point during their treatment, resulting
in cure or therapeutic response in both primary and
metastatic tumors. For intracranial tumors such as GBM,
RT has become a mainstay of treatment. Surprisingly,
strategies that exploit RT’s impact on brain tumor BBB
permeability in order to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs remain largely under-explored [22, 28].	
To investigate the potential advantages of cranial
RT to increase the potency of DLN in the treatment of
brain tumors, we used a novel mouse-based model of
human GBM to evaluate the relative efficacy of combined
modality treatment with RT plus a nanocarrier filomicelle
loaded with paclitaxel compared to single modality
treatment with either RT, drug loaded nanocarrier, or
the nanocarrier without paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is an ideal
therapeutic agent for such a trial. It is insoluble in water,
widely used against many cancers, and is even more
efficacious against GBM in vitro than temozolomide [3],
yet it is ineffective in vivo against intracranial tumors both
in animal models and in clinical trials of patients who also
received RT, presumably due to the inability of the drug
in its free form to penetrate the tumor BBB [4, 29-32].
The poor response of brain tumors to paclitaxel alone in
vivo ensures that any response to the paclitaxel-loaded
nanopolymer could not be ascribed to dissociation of the
paclitaxel from the nanocarrier or to degradation of the
carrier.
We had previously reported the efficacy of a
paclitaxel-linked filomicelle nanocarrier for treating
mice with subcutaneous tumor implants derived from
a lung cancer cell line [11], but for experiments using
human-derived GBM cells implanted into the brain we
used a new, even more flexible, less crystalline OCLA
filomicelle nanocarrier linked to paclitaxel (Fig. 1A, 1B,
Suppl. Fig. 1, and Suppl. Text). Based on our previous
work [11], we expected that this new nanocarrier would be
more effective at avoiding clearance by the mononuclear
phagocytic system than more rigid nanocarriers, thus
prolonging the serum half-life of the drug which would
increase its potential for diffusion through a tumor BBB

and retention (EPR) effect [5, 6]. The EPR effect is the
basis, for example, of preferential uptake of gadolinium
contrast agents into tumors compared to normal brain
tissue, as observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The anatomical and physiological factors promoting the
EPR effect that lead to increased extravasation of drugs
and macromolecules from the serum into tumors are not
uniformly distributed throughout tumors [7, 8]. The EPR
effect is often maximal at core regions within a tumor,
regions frequently characterized by necrosis, while the
EPR effect is diminished at the peripheral zones of a
tumor. These peripheral areas may contain many viable
cancer cells and are also the regions where the tumor BBB
is most likely to remain intact.
A novel approach to maximize EPR-driven
concentration of chemotherapeutic agents within tumors
is utilization of drug-loaded nanocarriers (DLNs) that
stably incorporate drug molecules [9, 10]. These agents
offer the potential to increase drug delivery into tumors
by either reducing drug clearance/excretion to increase
the drug’s serum half-life or by enhancing permeability
of the nanocarrier-drug combination through the tumor’s
abnormal endothelium compared to the permeability of the
drug alone.
One class of recently developed DLN is filomicelles
that are filamentous, polymeric self-assemblies that can
incorporate paclitaxel. Filomicelles avoid rapid clearance
by the mononuclear phagocytic system of the liver and
spleen, causing an increase in the serum half-life of the
drug [11, 12]. Flexibility of the filaments was shown to be
important in reducing drug clearance, and the crystalline
rigidity of past polymer assemblies is suppressed in these
filomicelles with novel hydrophilic-linked-hydrophobic
block copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide)-blockpoly(ε-caprolactone-random-D,L-lactide) (OCLA) that
randomize the packing in the hydrophobic, polyester core.
In subcutaneous tumor xenografts, this reduction in drug
clearance has been shown to maximize drug delivery to
the tumors with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy [11].
Filomicelles have been shown to flow through
the brain vasculature, but like other DLN they do not
penetrate the BBB [13]. Therefore, targeted disruption
of the tumor’s BBB to increase DLN permeability might
enhance the effectiveness of these and other DLNs for
treating intracranial tumors. Conventional approaches
for transiently disrupting the BBB before delivery of
chemotherapy, such as efflux transporter inhibitors,
bradykinins, intra-arterial infusions of osmotic disruption
agents (e.g. mannitol), and convection-enhanced delivery
mechanisms [14-19], lack specificity for tumor-associated
vasculature. Non-targeted disruption of the BBB with
these agents is likely to facilitate accumulation of drugs
into the normal brain, resulting in potentially serious
normal tissue complications limiting the dose that can be
used for treatments [14-18]. Several approaches for more
targeted disruption of the tumor-BBB are being studied

disrupted by RT.
For our mouse model, we implanted human-derived
U251 GBM cells. This cell line was selected because
previous reports demonstrated that implants of these cells
retain numerous characteristics frequently observed in
human GBM tumors [33], including necrosis, regions
of hypoxia, increased vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), HIF-1α expression and tumor invasiveness [3337].
We evaluated the response of implanted tumors to
the paclitaxel-loaded filomicelle both with and without
RT using serial bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of GBM
cells to track tumor growth and response to treatment.
The treatment response was also serially assessed using
clinically relevant measures such as body weight and
overall survival. We quantified RT-modulation of the BBB
via extravasation of Evans Blue dye, immunoglobulin
(IgG), and DLN from the systemic circulation [14, 15,
38-40]. As controls, we also examined the effect of RT
alone and the effect of the nanocarrier linked only to an
inert, near-infrared (IR) dye that had demonstrated no antitumor activity in previous experiments [11].

detectable in live mice via bioluminescent imaging (BLI)
(Suppl. Fig. 2B) [47]. Sacrificed mice were assessed by
fluorescent microscopy or hematoxylin and eosin staining
(Suppl. Fig. 2C-E) that confirmed that the established
tumors recapitulated many of the key features associated
with glioblastoma, such as necrosis, regions of hypoxia,
increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
and HIF-1α expression (Suppl. Fig 3) as previously
reported by Radaelli et al [35]. We also saw evidence of
tumor invasiveness (Suppl. Fig 7) with our mouse model
consistent with the findings of others [35-37]. We further
confirmed both in vitro and in vivo that the intensity of
the bioluminescent signal was directly proportional to
the number of viable luciferase-expressing GBM cells
and to the physical dimensions of the tumor. Higher BLI
signal correlated well with increased tumor cell burden
(Suppl. Fig. 4-5 and data not shown) [34]. These studies
established that our animal model of GBM recapitulated
clinical features of human tumors yet was amenable to
serial non-invasive imaging.
Nanocarriers with paclitaxel are effective against
GBM cells in culture and in flank xenografts but not
against intracranial GBM tumors
Before assessing the efficacy of combined modality
therapy with radiation plus DNL against GBM, we
performed pilot studies to measure the efficacy of DLN
alone against GBM cells in culture as well as against cells
grown as xenografts in either the flank or the brain. We
chose to incorporate paclitaxel into the DLN because this
chemotherapy was effective against GBM cells in culture
but is reportedly unable to penetrate the BBB.
Both free paclitaxel and paclitaxel-loaded
filomicelles reduced the in vitro viability of U251, U251GFP-Luc, and other GBM cells to a similar degree when
normalized to an equivalent dose of free paclitaxel (Fig.
1C, Suppl. Table 1).
After cell culture studies confirmed the potential
anti-GBM efficacy of our DLN, we tested its efficacy
against U251-GFP-Luc tumors established either in the
flank or orthotopic intracranial tumors. Tumors implanted

RESULTS
Mouse model of human GBM suitable for serial
imaging
Our studies used human GBM cells that retain
numerous characteristics frequently observed in tumors
from patients [33, 35-37]. In order to track the growth
of these cells serially and to distinguish them from
host tissues of the mouse, a lentivirus containing genes
for luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was
transduced into and stably expressed in U251 cells
(Suppl. Fig. 2A). These “U251-GFP-Luc” cells were
injected into the brains of mice via stereotactic techniques,
and the resultant tumors and their growth were readily

following completion of RT, mice were perfused with 10% formalin followed by sectioning and imaging of the brains under microscopy
for IgG extravasation out of the systemic circulation. Increased IgG extravasation was evident at 11 and 21 days after RT compared
to the un-irradiated controls but was muted by 35 days after RT. The IgG is detected as dark brown regions of staining, representing

RT revealed significantly increased fluorescent signal in the irradiated brain tumors at 24 and 72 hours compared to the mock irradiated
brain tumors (p<0.05), indicating increased tumor-BBB disruption induced by radiation. (H) Increased BBB disruption within the brain
tumor corresponded to the radiation therapy field. Higher magnification images show that targeted radiation therapy (RT) considerably
enhanced BBB permeability beyond that pre-existing within regions of the brain tumor. The dashed box delineates the RT field, within

at either site grew at identical rates and were amenable
to serial bioluminescent imaging (Table 1, Suppl. Fig.
5). We treated flank and brain tumors with nanocarrier
alone without paclitaxel (“Control”) or nanocarrier loaded
with paclitaxel. The Control treatment did not impede
the growth of either flank or intracranial tumors. DLN
was effective against flank tumors, almost completely
abrogating the growth of these tumors for the duration of
the experiment (Fig. 1D). In contrast to the flank tumors,
the intracranial tumors showed much less response to
the administered DLN. Intracranial tumors continued to
grow robustly despite DLN, with a tumor growth delay
of less than one week (Fig. 1E). Moreover, there was no
significant difference in the overall survival of the animals
with intracranial tumors treated with DLN alone compared
with control animals.
This difference in response to DLN according to
tumor location was observed even though intracranial
and flank implants had similar cellular growth rates
and protein expression profiles. We confirmed that both
flank and intracranial tumors contained highly similar
protein expression via a novel mass spectrometry analysis
algorithm that selects and quantifies only tryptic peptides
derived specifically from the human proteome [48]. Twofold or larger differences in human protein abundance
between flank tumors and brain tumors were very
uncommon, found in only 5 of 162 human proteins, or
3.1% of the detectable proteome. Specifically, the flank
tumors were found to have more extracellular matrix,
adhesion, and cytoskeletal proteins, which is not surprising
given the collagenous nature of subcutaneous sites (Suppl.
Fig. 6).
These results, taken together, suggest that DLN is
effective against GBM cells both in culture and when these
cells are grown as flank tumors, but DLN is ineffective
against the same tumor when it is located within the brain,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

probably due to the limited permeability of the DLN
through the tumor-BBB.

Targeted radiation therapy disrupts the bloodbrain barrier of the brain tumor
MRI studies in patients have suggested that RT
can disrupt tumor-associated BBB integrity [21]. To
confirm this effect in a mouse-based brain tumor model,
we assayed changes in the integrity of the BBB using
two established and complementary measures of BBB
integrity, the extravasation of Evans Blue (EB) dye and
immunoglobulin G (IgG) [39, 40]. EB can be readily
visualized under ambient light or fluorescence with high
signal intensity over background (Suppl. Fig. 7), but EB
must be infused into the animal immediately prior to
sacrifice. In contrast, IgG is a normal constituent of serum
and is not normally detected in large amounts in the brain.
Consequently, the detection of high levels of IgG in the
brain indicates extravasation from the systemic circulation
through defects in the BBB.
The extravasation of EB and IgG after irradiation
of the brain is shown in Fig. 2A. The right cerebral
hemispheres of healthy nude mice were irradiated
with 20 Gy in a single fraction (a dose employed in
stereotactic hypofractionated radiation therapy), followed
by assessment for EB and IgG extravasation 24 hours
later. The irradiated brains showed substantial EB and
IgG extravasation, while mock-irradiated control brains
showed no extravasation. Fractionated RT also produced
an increase in EB extravasation, with more extravasation
seen at higher doses (Fig. 2B).
We next investigated whether RT also affects
the BBB within brain tumors. We targeted orthotopic
GBM tumors in mice, followed by assessment for IgG

Figure 3: When combined with targeted radiation therapy, DLN has enhanced efficacy against intracranial human

extravasation (Fig. 2C). After exposure to RT, brain
tumor-bearing regions showed large increases in IgG
extravasation, often to a degree greater than that seen in
irradiated normal brain tissue (note in Fig. 2C the diffuse,
substantial IgG staining in tumor after RT in comparison
with the focal peri-vascular IgG staining after radiation in
normal brain seen in Fig. 2A).
The increased permeability of the tumor-associated
BBB induced by targeted RT was durable. Increased IgG
extravasation in irradiated tumors was still very evident
at 11 and 21 days after RT, and it was reduced but still
detectable by 35 days after RT (Fig. 2C). These results
in mice indicate that targeted RT efficiently disrupts the
tumor-associated BBB, corroborating previously reported
RT-induced modulation of the tumor BBB in patients.

presence of sporadic foci of BBB perturbation known to
exist within brain tumors (also shown in Suppl. Fig. 7). In
contrast, the brains of mice that had undergone SAARP
irradiation showed intense extravasation of nanocarrierdye within the radiation portal that encompassed the brain
tumor while showing no increase in fluorescent signal
in the unirradiated portions of the brain (Fig. 2H). The
increased extravasation of fluorescent dye into brain
tumors after targeted RT was therefore consistent with
experiments showing similarly increased extravasation of
IgG within brain tumors after RT. As an additional test,
the fluorescent signal of other tissues and organs from
both the brain-irradiated and mock-irradiated mice were
compared; these were all found to have similarly low
signal intensities that were much smaller than the high
signals observed in the irradiated brain and tumor (data
not shown). These experiments together indicate that
targeted cranial irradiation can significantly increase BBB
permeability within brain tumors, leading to significantly
greater extravasation and penetration of the filomicelle
nanocarrier into the tumors.

Radiation therapy increases extravasation of
nanocarrier into intracranial tumors
To assess whether the RT-induced increase in brain
tumor BBB permeability would facilitate the deposition
of larger concentrations of the filomicelle nanocarrier
within tumors (Fig. 2D), we administered the nanocarrier
loaded not with paclitaxel but with a marker consisting
of a hydrophobic, near-infrared fluorescent dye (“DiR”,
1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’Tetramethylindotricarbocya
nine iodide) amenable to in vivo fluorescent imaging in
live mice. We first confirmed that the incorporation of the
dye did not affect the half-life of the nanocarrier in the
circulation; the nanocarrier-dye assembly remained readily
detectable in the blood 24 hours after tail vein injection
(Fig. 2E). We then administered the nanocarrier-dye to
mice implanted with brain tumors that had undergone
fractionated cranial irradiation or mock irradiation. We
targeted the anterior portion of the brain containing the
tumor using the highly collimated, precise radiation
therapy achievable with a novel custom-designed cranialand body-restraint system in conjunction with the Small
Animal Radiation Research Platform (SAARP) (Fig.
2F, Suppl. Fig. 8). These mice subsequently underwent
serial in vivo fluorescent imaging to detect the dye marker
attached to the nanocarrier.
The mice whose brain tumors received targeted
cranial irradiation showed more than a five-fold increase
above the signal detected in the tumors of mice who
were mock-irradiated (p<0.05) (Fig. 2G). The increased
dye signal appeared in their tumors by 24 hours after
irradiation with further intensification by 72 hours. To
confirm the accurate targeting of the cranial radiation,
and that the radiation increased focal extravasation of
the nanocarrier-dye conjugate, the mice were euthanized,
and their brains were excised and immediately subjected
to fluorescent imaging. Brains containing tumors that
were mock-irradiated showed only a small degree of
nanocarrier-dye extravasation, presumably due to the

Radiation therapy plus DLN suppresses brain
tumor growth and prolongs survival
We next sought to test the efficacy of nanocarriers
loaded with a chemotherapeutic agent in irradiated brain
tumors. Mice implanted with brain tumors were treated
either with RT alone to the whole brain (3 Gy daily x 4
days) or RT combined with paclitaxel-loaded nanocarrier
(RT + DLN). Both RT and RT + DLN were effective in
slowing intracranial tumor growth, but the combination
treatment was significantly more effective than RT alone
as assessed by bioluminescence imaging (p<0.05) (Fig.
3A-3B).
We found the DLN was well-tolerated by the
mice, even when administered in combination with RT.
The most clinically relevant endpoint is survival, which
reflects tumor control but is also affected by any potential
complications of treatment. Mice treated with the RT +
DLN continued to eat and maintain body weight until
tumor progression reached a lethal threshold. The mean
and median overall survival of mice with intracranial
tumors treated with RT + DLN was superior to mice
receiving RT alone or DLN alone (mean: 35 vs. 23 vs.
18 days; median: 34 vs. 21 vs. 18 days, respectively,
p<0.001 for all comparisons) (Fig. 3C, Suppl. Fig. 9).
The addition of RT to DLN treatment therefore resulted
in an improvement in median survival of >50% compared
to animals that received RT or DLN alone. Furthermore,
mice treated with combined RT and DLN successfully
maintained body weight (Suppl. Tables 2-3). These
experiments together indicate that the combination of
DLN with targeted cranial radiation results in improved
survival.

While these results were encouraging, we
investigated whether the efficacy of combined modality
therapy could be further improved by increasing the
dose of paclitaxel incorporated into the nanocarrier and
simultaneously optimizing radiation treatment techniques
to a level of sophistication more closely resembling that
which is administered to patients. Brain tumors are often
treated with stereotactic techniques in which the tumor is
delineated via pretreatment imaging, and fiducial markers
or specialized hardware are used to mark the location
of the tumor to ensure the highest degree of accuracy
and reproducibility in targeting with RT. We therefore
constructed for the mice a version of head-frames
employed for stereotactic radiation therapy consisting of a
plastic bed with Teflon screws that insert into the external
acoustic meatus of the mouse. This novel, non-traumatic
restraint simultaneously minimized head rotation and
maximized positional reproducibility (Fig. 2F, Supp.
Fig. 8) [34]. This setup integrated into the SARRP and
allowed us to perform cone-beam CT for target delineation
before each radiation therapy administration [49]. These
techniques together enabled us to target brain tumors
with a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility. We
coupled these more sophisticated RT treatments with
the use of hiDLN, our preparation of the nanocarrier
that delivered 48% of the daily maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel [43], or 9.55 mg/
kg, given as 1 mL IP treatments, rather than the 29% of
MTD delivered in earlier experiments. We found that the
optimized radiation therapy techniques, even with the
higher dose of paclitaxel, were well-tolerated by the mice.
Many of the treated mice gained weight during treatment
compared to their pre-treatment weight, presumably
because of tumor regression and because of reduced
toxicity from radiation therapy as improved radiation
therapy targeting resulted in greater sparing of normal
tissues such as the oropharyngeal mucosa.
By optimizing both radiation therapy techniques
and DLN paclitaxel dosing, we achieved the greatest
overall effect. This combination of radiation therapy and
hiDLN now resulted in median survivals that were more
than double the survivals of animals receiving RT alone
(p<0.05) (Fig. 3D). Moreover, a majority of mice treated
with the combined (RT+hiDLN) treatment remained alive
and thriving at the end of the experiment with no evidence
of residual brain tumor. In contrast, all mice treated with
RT alone died. These results together support the efficacy
of combined modality therapy using targeted radiation
therapy to disrupt the tumor BBB to facilitate greater DLN
penetration into tumors, resulting in improved treatment
efficacy compared to the results achieved with either RT
or DLN alone.

GBM or brain metastases remains a particularly difficult
therapeutic challenge. The blood-brain barrier prevents
accumulation of potentially harmful chemicals, such
as chemotherapy, within the central nervous system
and therefore helps protect against adverse effects on
cognition and other critical functions. The portion of the
BBB that is within intracranial tumors likewise impedes
the accumulation of therapeutic levels of chemotherapy
and attempts to identify new chemotherapeutic agents that
can effectively penetrate the tumor-BBB are still ongoing
[16, 50, 51]. A recent animal study of experimental brain
metastases from human breast cancer cells found that
although most metastases showed some degree of tumor
BBB permeability compromise, the concentrations of
paclitaxel or doxorubicin accumulated within these brain
metastases were <15% of that achieved in extracranial
metastases [52]. Consequently, the tumor BBB impedes
the accumulation of therapeutic concentrations of both
of these agents thereby limiting their effectiveness for
treating intracranial tumors.
The presence of a structural barrier within the
brain impeding the accumulation of therapeutic levels
of drug likely helps explain why chemotherapy agents
such as paclitaxel, which are lethal against GBM cells
in vitro, fail to improve outcomes in patients with brain
malignancies when tested in clinical trials [4]. Our results,
as well as those of Lockman et al., indicate that although
the vasculature within an intracranial tumor is partially
permeable to macromolecules as evidenced by limited
extravasation of IgG in orthotopic tumor xenografts
[52], this partial permeability is insufficient to allow
accumulation of therapeutic levels of drug. We therefore
pursued a dual approach towards improving therapeutic
efficacy: using a drug delivery vehicle that enhances
circulation time and drug retention in tumors while using
radiation to increase the permeability of the tumor BBB to
the chemotherapeutic agent.
Nanopolymer therapeutics represent a novel
and expanding class of drug delivery systems that are
currently showing great promise. Such agents can often
be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally and
can incorporate many anticancer drugs. Customized
configurations of shape, size, and composition of the
nanocarrier can substantially influence the in vivo
performance of the therapeutics. The OCLA developed
here is a new PEG-based block copolymer that randomizes
lactic acid and caprolactone in the hydrophobic chain
(Fig. 1A) to minimize pure polyester crystallinity and
glassiness [41] that, in turn, tend to limit drug loading
and make the filomicelles more rigid. Flexibility fosters
circulation of filomicelles for days longer than smaller,
more spherical assemblies of the same composition
[29]. This increased serum half-life facilitates diffusion
of the drug-loaded carrier into solid extracranial tumors
that lack a permeability barrier analogous to the bloodbrain barrier while enhancing drug retention within the

tumors to increase treatment efficacy. The blood-brain
barrier effectively limits the enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effect, explaining why DLN that
are effective against extracranial tumors are ineffective
against intracranial tumors. For this series of experiments,
we chose a microns-long filomicelle nanocarrier whose
flexibility increases serum half-life but whose larger size
makes it even less likely to permeate through an intact
blood-brain barrier than smaller nanocarriers so that any
increased extravasation of DLN observed after RT can be
ascribed to disruption of BBB permeability by RT. 	
We chose an orthotopic U251 tumor model for these
studies because in our experience, and in the experience
of other labs, this model recapitulates many of the key
features of clinical GBM, including rapid growth, necrosis,
hypoxia, increased VEGF expression, and invasive growth
[33-37], although we acknowledge that any implantable
mouse model for GBM has inherent limitations. We
considered using an endogenous GBM model, but we felt
that the orthotopic model had distinct advantages because
it allowed us to grow tumors of consistent size and
anatomic location so that we could stratify mice evenly
to different treatment groups and deliver the same focal,
stereotactic radiation to each tumor. The heterogeneous
anatomic locations and different sizes of endogenous
tumors would have been confounding factors for our
survival studies. Our novel technique for precise, imageguided treatment of mouse brain tumors using the Small
Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP) microirradiator and our home-built stereotactic restrainer, an
approach closer to clinical radiation treatment methods
than previously reported in the mouse literature [34],
required reproducible tumors to ensure that radiation
treatment plans would be identical so that RT toxicity
and integral dose to critical brain structures would be
equivalent across all treatment stratifications.
We specifically chose paclitaxel to load in the
nanocarrier rather than temozolomide, the current
treatment of choice for clinical GBM, because there is
evidence that paclitaxel is more potent in vitro against
GBM [3] and because in its free form it has relatively
poor penetration of the tumor BBB even when combined
with radiation, accounting for the disappointing outcomes
in a Phase II clinical trial of RT + paclitaxel vs. RT alone
for GBM [4]. Testing a drug like paclitaxel that has
poor tumor BBB penetration in its free form, even with
RT, allowed us to conclude that any treatment benefit
was likely derived from enhanced delivery of paclitaxel
across the tumor BBB as a result of the nanocarrier, rather
than dissociation of the drug from the nanocarrier or
degradation of the nanocarrier.
We employed the filomicelle DLN loaded with
paclitaxel that previous work has shown to enhance the
duration of systemic circulation and EPR. In previous
experiments, the empty nanocarrier was very well
tolerated with no ill effects observed in nude mice and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

no increase in apoptosis observed in xenograft tumors or
in key normal tissues like the heart, lung, liver, spleen,
and kidney compared to mice injected with equivalent
volumes of normal saline [11]. There was also no antitumor treatment effect observed for the empty nanocarrier
[11]. The nanocarrier loaded with paclitaxel had a
significantly higher MTD than free paclitaxel in nude
mice and demonstrated greater tumor specificity with
less apoptosis observed in normal organs compared to
free paclitaxel [11]. This agent proved to be safe in our
experiments with almost no discernible toxicity noted in
treated animals despite daily administration of amounts
approaching levels at which 50% of animals treated with
free paclitaxel alone would be expected to show morbidity.
Compared to the efficacy of paclitaxel-loaded DLN
for treating extracranial tumors, we found that paclitaxelloaded DLN had insufficient effect on intracranial
orthotopic tumors to be considered as a treatment for
GBM or metastatic disease. Mice treated with the
drug-loaded nanocarrier had only a minimal, transient
reduction in the growth of their intracranial tumors and
only a modestly improved survival compared to control
animals receiving nanocarrier without paclitaxel. These
observations suggested that the DLN could not, by itself,
effectively penetrate through the intracranial tumor BBB.
Prior work has suggested that radiation therapy
could disrupt the BBB, including the tumor BBB [21].
We hypothesized that radiation-induced disruption of the
tumor BBB might enhance permeation and retention of
vascular-delivered therapeutic reagents within the targeted
tumor. We confirmed that this was indeed the case, through
both in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Radiation therapy
(RT) by itself disrupted the tumor BBB at doses that were
well-tolerated by the animals as shown by the increased
extravasation of fluorescent dye-loaded nanocarrier into
brain tumors following RT. In our experiments, mice
treated with RT + dye-loaded nanocarrier had equivalent
outcomes to those treated with RT alone, mirroring the
findings of Vinchon-Petit et al. that the empty nanocarrier
has very low toxicity and no intrinsic treatment effect [53].
We subsequently showed that the combination of
RT and paclitaxel-loaded DLN resulted in a therapeutic
response that was significantly better than the results
achieved with either RT or paclitaxel-loaded DLN alone.
In our preclinical study, the median overall survival of
subjects treated with the combination of RT + DLN was
improved over RT alone by 13 days. This extended survival
represents an increase over RT alone of approximately
61%. To put this into the appropriate clinical context,
temozolomide, the most important new drug to enter the
armamentarium against GBM in the last 10 years, when
combined with radiation results in an increase in survival
duration of only ~21% over RT alone in GBM patients [2].
When we optimized our radiation techniques to enhance
conformality of dose delivery with the tumor target and
we increased the dose of paclitaxel integrated into the
73

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 64-79

DLN, we observed additional improvements in survival.
A majority of the animals treated with optimized radiation
therapy techniques and hiDLN remained alive at the end
of the experiment with no detectable signs of tumor. We
further note that the animals tolerated this combination
of targeted RT and hiDLN remarkably well. Despite the
presence of advanced tumors, all mice tolerated repeated
administrations of DLN without discernible toxicities or
weight loss.
These results together indicate that targeted RT can
usefully serve as a modulator of tumor BBB permeability
to enhance therapeutic drug delivery to intracranial
tumors such as GBM. Furthermore, the increased serum
half-life and EPR properties of DLN result in enhanced
accumulation of therapeutic anticancer drugs within
the irradiated intracranial tumor once the tumor BBB is
breached. While clinical trials would clearly be required
to establish the safety of DLN formulations in patients
when combined with radiation, these observations are
encouraging. The success of DLN combined with RT
against bulky, non-resected tumors in mice suggests
that similar therapeutic approaches might have a future
role in the treatment of intracranial neoplasms such as
GBM whose prognosis is notoriously grim with current
treatment options. The outcome of such clinical trials
to test the efficacy and safety of exciting new agents
that include drug-loaded nanocarriers would be eagerly
awaited by patients and healthcare providers alike.

intracranial xenograft tumors in nude mice.

In vitro Analysis of Tumor Cell Luminescence
Transduced cells were trypsinized, washed with
PBS, counted with a Coulter counter, and plated at halving
dilutions in the wells of a 24-well plate. An identical
corresponding dilution series of unmodified cells was
plated as a negative control. Four hours after plating,
a saturating dose of D-luciferin was added to each cell
sample, and luminescent signals were recorded using the
IVIS Lumina system.

Polymer Synthesis and Preparation of Filomicelle
Paclitaxel-loaded Nanocarrier
The flexible filomicelles consist of a degradable
diblock copolymer that is synthesized by ring-opening
polymerization of the hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide)
ε-caprolactone using D,L-lactide and methoxy terminated
poly(ethylene oxide) as a macro initiator and stannous
octoate as catalyst. Briefly, freshly distilled ε-caprolactone
(2.5 g, 0.0219 mol), 2000g/mol of poly(ethylene oxide)
(PEO), D,L-lactide, and stannous octoate (15 mg, 3.7 x
10-5 moles) were weighed out in a flamed and nitrogendried ampule. The ampule was sealed and placed in an
oven pre-equilibrated to 140ºC, and the polymerization
reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 hours. The
reaction was terminated after cooling the ampule to room
temperature.
A solvent evaporation method was then used to
generate the filomicelles, which were combined with
paclitaxel in methanol, dialyzed against PBS and filtered
by extrusion to remove any paclitaxel aggregates to
generate the drug-loaded nanocarrier formulation. For
preparation of our standard concentration of DLN, the
polymer concentration was 4 mg/ml and paclitaxel was
added to achieve polymer/paclitaxel weight-to-weight
(w/w) ratio of 20:1. We also prepared a more concentrated
nanocarrier-paclitaxel solution (hiDLN) starting with
a polymer concentration of 20 mg/ml with paclitaxel
added to achieve a w/w ratio of 32:1. Increased addition
of paclitaxel does not lead to better loading because of
precipitation of polymer and paclitaxel.
Detailed information on the synthesis, purification,
and analysis of the paclitaxel-loaded nanocarrier is
provided in the Supplemental Section and can also be
found in previous publications [11, 41].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All experiments with animals were performed
in accordance with IACUC guidelines according to an
IACUC-approved protocol, and all surgical procedures
were conducted according to current institutional
guidelines for animal experiments.

Modification of Tumor Cells for Stable Expression
of Firefly Luciferase & GFP
The human-derived GBM tumor cell line U251
was transduced with a lentiviral construct (pGreenFire,
purchased from System Biosciences) containing the firefly
luciferase gene and the green fluorescent protein (GFP)
gene under the control of an SFFV (spleen focus-forming
virus) promoter. 200,000 cells were plated and washed
with PBS. Thawed viral particles in 250 µL Dulbecco’s
Modification of Eagle’s medium (DMEM) were added
to the cells. Cells were allowed to incubate for 72 hours.
After transfection, supernatant with virus was collected
and passed through a 22 nm filter. The filtered supernatant
was used to infect the target U251 cells. The transduced
U251 cells were sorted twice with flow cytometry to select
the top 1% of cells based on fluorescence for propagation
in culture and for implantation as subcutaneous or

Intracranial Implantation of Tumor cells
We used an orthotopic model system to ensure that
the mice in the different treatment groups had similar brain
tumors. All tumors were implanted into the right side of
74

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 64-79

placed on their abdomen with their limbs symmetrically
arranged such that their feet were pointed cephalad.
Once a mouse was sufficiently anesthetized so that no
response was elicited from a light pinch of the rear foot,
the site of injection was cleaned with alcohol. Using
aseptic technique, an injection of 100 microliters of a
cell suspension containing 2 x 106 tumor cells along with
DMEM media was administered using a 26 gauge 5/8”
needle into each site. No closure was necessary.

the brain, were sufficiently large to approximate the tumor
burden observed in GBM patients without being so large
that the animals would expire before treatment effects
could be ascertained, and were placed in a location and
limited to a size that could be precisely radiated using
the image-guided Small Animal Radiation Research
Platform micro-irradiator (SARRP). The uniformity of
the brain tumors was designed to ensure that RT toxicity
and the integral dose to critical brain structures would be
equivalent in the various treatment groups [34, 42].
Nude athymic NCr mice (nu/nu) at 6 weeks of age
were obtained from the NCI. One hour prior to intracranial
implantation the mice were weighed and pre-medicated
with a subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/ kg of meloxicam in
saline to control for post-operative pain and inflammation.
The mice were anesthetized with an IP injection of
ketamine/xylazine at doses of 140mg/kg and 10mg/kg
respectively. Once the anesthesia extinguished the mouse’s
response to light pinching of the rear foot, the mouse
was positioned in a stereotactic device (Stoelting Digital
Just for Mice Stereotactic Instrument) for improved
immobilization of the animal and to enhance the precision
of the intracranial implantation. The mouse’s temperature
was monitored throughout the surgery with a rectal probe
and maintained at 37°C with feedback control to a heating
plate positioned underneath the animal. An ophthalmic
ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent drying. Using
aseptic technique, the top of the head was swabbed with
betadine, and a small, 0.75 cm longitudinal incision was
made through the scalp to expose the skull. Using the
stereotactic armature, a small hole was drilled using the
Foredom Microdrill with a 0.45 mm burr at the injection
site at coordinates 2 mm posterior and 1.5 mm lateral to
the bregma in the right cerebral hemisphere. Through this
aperture, a stereotactically-guided syringe with a 30 gauge
flat bevel needle (Hamilton Syringe) delivered in sterile
fashion approximately 300,000 luciferase/GFP-expressing
U251 human-derived brain tumor cells in 6 microliters of
DMEM media 2.5 mm deep within the brain parenchyma
at an injection rate of 0.5 µL/minute using the Automated
Injector Pump by Harvard Apparatus [42]. After injection,
the needle was left in the brain for a period of 2 minutes
and then slowly withdrawn. The incision was closed with
bone wax, the skin re-approximated with glue, and the
animal was moved to a heated pad for the post-operative
recovery.

Radiation Therapy
For each control and treatment group, mice were
evenly divided based on pre-treatment weight and
maximum bioluminescent signal intensity. Mice were
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine at doses of 140 mg/
kg and 10mg/kg respectively, and then individually mockirradiated or irradiated in either a Mark I cesium irradiator
(J. L. Shepherd, San Fernando, CA) or the Small Animal
Radiation Research Platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl, Surrey,
United Kingdom), at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min. For mice
irradiated using the cesium irradiator, each mouse was
fitted with a lead shield that exposed only the desired
target before being placed in the irradiator. Radiation
was administered with a unidirectional beam for a predetermined length of time corresponding to the desired
dosage. Unless otherwise stated, the radiation dose was 3
Gy/fraction administered once daily for four days.
Mice treated with optimized radiation techniques
were treated in a custom-made plastic mouse bed equipped
with a stereotactic head immobilizer that integrated with
the SARRP [34]. The anatomy of the skull and brain was
imaged with the SARRP’s onboard cone-beam CT. The
location of the tumor was determined by bioluminescent
imaging, and the skull was tattooed to define the beam’s
location. All these techniques helped ensure day-today reproducibility and precise delivery of the radiation
therapy [34].
In experiments to test the efficacy of paclitaxelloaded nanobiopolymer combined with fractionated
radiation therapy, the standard concentration of DLN was
given as a 1 mL intraperitoneal (IP) injection every other
day for 17 days beginning on day 1 of radiation. Mice in
the RT alone group received IP injections of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) of equal volume. Mice received up
to 29% of the daily maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IP
paclitaxel [43], or 5.89 mg/kg, per treatment. This dose
was approximately equivalent to 26% of the human MTD
as determined in a Phase II trial of GBM using concurrent
RT and free paclitaxel [4]. Overall survival was calculated
based on death or sustained loss of >20% of pre-treatment
weight, an IUCAC guideline for mandated euthanasia.
Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed using the
SPSS Software program.
A second experiment tested the efficacy of
RT+hiDLN vs. RT alone against intracranial tumors. Mice

Flank Implantation of Tumor cells
Flank injections of U251 cells identical to the
cells used for the intracranial injections were performed.
Mice were injected subcutaneously with tumor cells at a
site superficial to the scapulae bilaterally and superficial
and medial to the hip joints bilaterally. The mice were
anesthetized with an IP injection of ketamine/xylazine at
doses of 140mg/kg and 10mg/kg respectively and then

in the RT+hiDLN group were given 1 mL IP injections
of the more concentrated hiDLN every other day for 34
days (17 total treatments) beginning on day 1 of radiation.
Mice in the radiation alone group received IP injections
of PBS of equal volume. RT+hiDLN mice received 48%
of the daily MTD of intraperitoneal paclitaxel, or 9.55
mg/kg per treatment. This dose was roughly equivalent
to 42% of the human MTD from a study of GBM patients
undergoing concurrent treatment with free paclitaxel and
RT [4].

the left ventricle, and PBS was continuously infused. A
separate incision was made in the right atrium to allow
drainage of blood and replacement with 1xPBS. The
infusion was continued until the circulating fluid was clear.
After perfusion, the whole brain tissue was dissected,
removed, and post-fixed in 10% formalin overnight. The
following morning, the brain was placed in 30% sucrose
for 3 days, and transferred to isopentane until frozen
(stored in a -80°C freezer). Coronal tissue was sectioned
at 20 μm intervals slices with a cryostat (Microm HM 505
E), stained, and photographed using light microscopy and
fluorescence microscopy set to the red channel for Evans
Blue visualization. Immunostaining for the extravasation
of IgG immunoglobulin as a measure of BBB permeability
was performed by opening the mouse’s chest cavity
and pumping a continuous infusion of 1xPBS into the
left ventricle through an 18 gauge needle as described
above, followed by perfusion with 10% neutral buffered
formalin. The brain was removed and processed as above.
Sections were stained with anti-mouse IgG antibodies
(1:200 concentration), using horseradish peroxidasestreptavidin (1:400 concentration) and diaminobenzidine
for visualization. Stained sections were imaged using light
microscopy.

Bioluminescent Imaging
Mice were imaged using the IVIS Lumina II
bioluminescence imaging system beginning 1 week
after tumor injection. The mice were anesthetized by IP
injection with ketamine/xylazine (140mg/kg / 10mg/kg).
Once fully anesthetized, the mice received a subcutaneous
injection of 60 microliters of pharmaceutical-grade
D-luciferin (50 mg/mL) which freely crosses the BBB
[44]. Imaging via the IVIS system commenced at 5
minutes after the luciferin injection was delivered. The
mice were repeatedly imaged over a span of 30 minutes
to determine the maximum luminescence intensity in
photons/second, a surrogate marker for the size of the
tumor(s). IVIS imaging was repeated at least weekly to
measure tumor size. All bioimaging studies followed the
IACUC-approved guidelines for the Optical Imaging
Facility. After imaging acquisition, a volume of interest
(VOI) was drawn around each tumor and a background
VOI was drawn on the animal in an area known to
be free of tumor to generate a background-corrected
bioluminescence flux value for each tumor at each given
time point. The maximum background-corrected value
for that tumor during the 30 minute imaging session
was used as the maximum bioluminescent value. The
bioluminescence of tumors was tracked over time using
a measure termed “fold”, which was defined as: [current
max BLI signal] / [initial pre-treatment max BLI signal]
[45, 46].

DiR near-infrared
experiments

nanocarrier

To determine if RT facilitated extravasation of
the nanocarrier across the tumor BBB, we linked the
nanocarrier to DiR, a near-infrared fluorescent dye with
absorption of 748 nm and emission of 780 nm, using
the same protocol used for encapsulating paclitaxel
in the nanocarrier. Mice implanted intracranially with
U251-GFP-Luc cells according to our protocol were
stratified according to their BLI tumor signal intensity
and randomized to receive either mock irradiation (n=3)
or focal irradiation to their tumor implants to a dose of
12 Gy in 4 daily fractions of 3 Gy/fraction (n=4). 10 days
after RT, the mice were injected intravenously via tail
vein with 250 µL of the dye-loaded nanocarrier solution.
A third group of previously untreated mice without
tumors received an equal volume of PBS via tail vein
injection while a fourth group of previously untreated
mice without tumors received an equal volume of the
dye-loaded nanocarrier. In vivo and ex vivo near-infrared
fluorescence imaging of the brains of all of these mice was
performed using the LiCor Pearl imaging system using
the 800 nm wavelength setting. Mice were anesthetized in
the usual manner prior to imaging. In vivo brain imaging
was performed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after
injection of the dye-loaded nanocarrier or PBS. At 72
hours after injection, the brains were harvested, washed
in PBS, and imaged ex vivo using the LiCor Pearl.
Fluorescent signal intensity was assessed quantitatively by

Assays of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity
Blood-brain integrity was assessed by extravasation
of immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Evans Blue dye (EB), a
large molecular weight (961 Da) dye [39, 40]. For EB
assays, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine
and then given a tail vein injection of 2% Evans Blue dye
mixed in 1xPBS (4 ml/kg body weight, Sigma, E2129)
using a 26G 5/8” needle. The Evans Blue was allowed to
circulate for 5 hours before the mouse was re-anesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine. The circulating un-extravasated
EB was then removed by continuous perfusion. This was
accomplished by opening the chest cavity and exposing
the heart. An 18 gauge needle was carefully inserted into
