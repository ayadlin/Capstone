ABSTRACT
Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) by promoter methylation
can be an early event in the multi-step process of carcinogenesis. Human chromosome
3 contains clusters of TSGs involved in many cancer types including nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC), the most common cancer in Southern China. Among ten candidate
TSGs identified in chromosome 3 using NotI microarray, ITGA9 and WNT7A could
be validated. 5′-aza-2′ deoxycytidine treatment restored the expression of ITGA9
and WNT7A in two NPC cell lines. Immunostaining showed strong expression of
these genes in the membrane and cytoplasm of adjacent control nasopharyngeal
epithelium cells, while they were weakly expressed in NPC tumor cells. The ITGA9
promoter showed marked differentially methylation between tumor and control tissue,
whereas no differentially methylation could be detected for the WNT7A promoter. The
expression level of ITGA9 in NPC tumors was downregulated 4.9-fold, compared to
the expression in control. ITGA9 methylation was detected by methylation specific
PCR (MSP) in 56% of EBV positive NPC- cases with 100% specificity. Taken together,
this suggests that ITGA9 might be a TSG in NPC that is involved in tumor cell biology.
The possibility of using ITGA9 methylation as a marker for early detection of NPC
should further be explored.

presentation, epidemiology, and histopathology are
different from typical squamous cell carcinomas of
the head and neck [2]. NPC has a marked ethnic and
geographic distribution. Specifically, its most common
form, WHO type III is highly prevalent in Southern

and shows a close to 100% prevalence of Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) in the tumor cells [3–7]. Regardless of the
geographic distribution, NPC is suggested to result from
the contribution and interplay of at least three distinctly
different factors including environmental, genetic as well
as EBV infection [8].
NPC patients in stages I and II of the disease
have a significantly longer overall survival compared
with those in stages III and IV. The five-year
survival rate for stage III or IV patients is only around
40 to 50%, while it can be as high as 95% for stage I or II
patients [9–11]. Because of non-specific local symptoms
and the inconvenience of full clinical examination of the
nasopharynx, approximately 70% of NPC patients are only
diagnosed when the tumor has reached an advanced stage
with a poor prognosis [3, 10, 12]. Thus, early diagnosis
of NPC is essential to achieve satisfactory treatment
outcome. Finding biomarkers for detection of NPC at
an early stage and monitoring recurrent tumor would
contribute significantly to improve survival and guide
the choice of subsequent therapy, particularly in the high
incidence regions.
Changes in DNA methylation play an important role
in both normal development and differentiation as well
as cancer and several other diseases [13]. Alterations in
DNA methylation with resulting aberrant activation of
oncogenes or inactivation of certain TSGs is a key event
in cancer development [14, 15]. It has recently been
suggested that cancer can be initiated by an epigenetic
process before any mutations [16]. These TSGs were
shown to be involved in fundamental pathways, such
as apoptosis, DNA damage repair, tumor invasion
and metastasis, cell cycle control and intracellular
adhesion [17]. Silencing of potential TSGs by aberrant
methylation of CpG-rich promoter regions seems to be a
key mechanism in NPC carcinogenesis [18–20]. It might
be useful as a powerful means for the early diagnosis of
NPC [21, 22]. The establishment of methylation based
techniques for the early diagnosis of cancer will increase
the chances for treatment and improve the survival rate.
Several approaches that allow high-throughput
analyses of multiple CpG-rich regions in gene promoters
were recently developed, including methylation specific
oligonucleotide microarrays, restriction landmark genomic
scanning, and differential methylation hybridization [23–27].
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and cytogenetic studies earlier
showed that frequent changes in chromosome 3 are
common in many tumors, harboring several TSGs [28].
A NotI microarray developed by our group provides
another possibility to search for methylation related genes
in chromosome 3 [29]. The main idea of the approach is
that the NotI restriction enzyme cuts only unmethylated
CpG pairs inside the recognition sequence of the enzyme
(5′-GCGGCCGC-3′). Only a small fraction (0.1–0.5%)
of the human genome contains NotI restriction sites,
often located to CpG-islands [30]. Thus by using NMAs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(glass microarrays with attached NotI-sequence tagged
DNA fragments) we could compare the methylation status
of control and malignant cells at the genomic level.
In this study, using chromosome 3 NMA, 188  putative
TSGs were examined in NPC tumors and cell lines, and by
subsequent analysis ITGA9- and WNT7A- control regions
were shown to be hypermethylated and downregulated.

RESULTS
Screening for potentially methylated genes in
NPC using NotI microarrays
NotI microarrays were performed to screen the
potentially methylated genes in chromosome 3 in NPC.
Genomic DNA from three NPC tumor biopsies (T9, T10
and T18), two control nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues (N1
and N2), three NPC cell lines (CNE1, TWO3 and C666–1)
and one control nasopharyngeal epithelium derived cell line
NP69 were used for this screening. Ten genes (ALDH1L1,
BCL6, EPHB3, FGD5, FGF12, ITGA9, NUDT16P, RBSP3,
WNT7A and ZIC4) were identified showing reduced signal
in NPC samples as compared to control samples suggesting
methylation or deletion of these genes in NPC (Table 1). To
investigate the methylation status of these genes and possible
correlation with gene downregulation, methylation specific
PCR (MSP) and quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR)
were then performed. On the basis of the correlations
found between the MSP and Q-PCR results two genes
i.e. ITGA9 and WNT7A were selected for further validation
and investigation.

Demethylation and restoration ITGA9 and
WNT7A expression in NPC cell lines by
demethylating reagent 5′-aza-C
To investigate whether demethylating reagent
5′-aza-C could demethylate ITGA9 and WNT7A
promoters, NPC C666–1, CNE1, TWO3 cell lines and
control nasopharyngeal epithelium derived cell line NP69
were treated with 10 μM of the 5′-aza-C for 96 h, and
then MSP was performed to detect methylation status
of ITGA9 and WNT7A. It was observed that the CpGrich regions in the promoter of ITGA9 and WNT7A were
demethylated in NPC cell lines after 5′-aza-C treatment
by MSP, compared with untreated cells (Figure 1A & 2A).
A comparison of ITGA9 expression in NP69 and
C666–1 cell lines showed that the expression level of
ITGA9 mRNA was downregulated in NPC C666–1
(6.4 ± 0.1 fold) as compared to control cell line
(Figure 1B).
Furthermore Q-PCR was then performed to detect
ITGA9 and WNT7A mRNA expression (Figure 2C & 2D)
in 5′-aza-C treated and untreated NPC CNE1 and TWO3
cell lines. The expression level of ITGA9 mRNA was
upregulated in NPC CNE1 and TWO3 after 5′-aza-C

of WNT7A was also upregulated in NPC CNE1 and
TWO3 after 5′-aza-C treatment (3.1 ± 0.2 fold; 5.6 ± 0.1

Thus demethylating reagent 5′-aza-C could restore
the expression of ITGA9 and WNT7A in NPC cell
lines. This suggests that the downregulation of
ITGA9 and WNT7A in NPC cell lines could be due to
hypermethylation of promoters of these genes and not
because of deletion of these genes in these cell lines.

Hypermethylation of ITGA9 and
WNT7A in NPC

Two sub regions with high density CpGs
in the ITGA9 control region were analyzed with
pyrosequencing of the bisulfite converted tissue DNA.
Two pyrosequencing assays (Pyro-S1 and Pyro-S2)
targeted two different sets of CpGs that were located
in the same region that was subjected to the sequencing
of the clones derived from bisulfite converted DNAs as
shown (Figure 4A). Pyro-S1 contained four CpGs. Three
out of the four CpGs in pyro-S1 and all three CpGs
covered by pyro-S2 overlapped with the CpGs used for
sequencing the bisulfite converted DNA driven clones.
Five biopsies (NPC-547, NPC-562, NPC-581, NPC-586
and NPC-587) and two control nasopharyngeal epithelia
biopsies (NNE-1 and NNE-2) were sequenced with this
method (Figure 6). The majority of the CpGs in ITGA9
gene promoter were partially methylated in all the NPC
samples, while they were unmethylated in the control
samples.

The methylation status of ITGA9 and WNT7A
promoters in NPC tumor biopsy samples was investigated
by sequencing of clones after bisulfite conversion.
A CpG-rich region in the promoter of ITGA9 gene was
investigated (Figure 4A). This region containing 11 CpG
sites and was sequenced in nine NPC biopsies (NPC-1,
NPC-2, NPC-5, NPC-6, NPC-547, NPC-562, NPC-581,
NPC-586 and NPC-587) and six control nasopharyngeal
epithelia biopsy (NNE-1, NNE-2, NNE-3, NNE-7,
NNE-10 and NNE-20) (Figure 4B). This CpG-rich region
in ITGA9 promoter was partially methylated in all NPC
samples, whereas only a few CpG sites were partially
methylated in the control samples. To investigate the
methylation status of WNT7A, sequencing of the clones
derived from bisulfite converted DNA was performed at a
CpG-rich region in its promoter (Figure 5A). This region
contained 84 CpG sites. Four NPC biopsies (NPC-1,
NPC-2, NPC-5 and NPC-6) and three control
nasopharyngeal epithelia biopsy (NNE-3, NNE-7 and
NNE-10) were sequenced (Figure 5B). This CpG-rich
region was partially methylated in the four NPC samples.
There was virtually no methylation in the two control
samples (NNE-3 and NNE-10) while one control sample
(NNE-7) showed some methylation at several CpG sites.
Taken together these results suggested that particularly
ITGA9 could be a candidate TSG in NPC worthy of
further analysis.

ITGA9 in NPC tumors and in control epithelial tissues

MSP in 56% (20/36) of NPC DNA samples with 100%
specificity (0/18 of non-cancerous control; Figure 8A).
WNT7A methylation was detected by MSP in 69%
(25/36) of NPC DNA samples with 83% specificity
(3 out of 18 in non-cancerous control; Figure 8B). These
results suggest that ITGA9 could be a TSG in NPC and
promoter hypermethylation could be one mechanism for
ITGA9 downregulation in NPC. This might also suggest
that ITGA9 could be used as an early detection marker
for NPC.

DISCUSSION

in NPC [36]. This region was shown to contain several
TSGs [28, 37–39]. This suggests that inactivation of
certain TSGs on chromosome 3 by mutations or epigenetic
modifications might play a critical role in NPC [40].
In NPC, a vast number of TSGs are silenced
by epigenetic mechanisms, primarily by promoter
hypermethylation [41, 42]. It is highly interesting that
EBV-infection is associated with extensive DNA methylation
in EBV carrying malignancies, also recently demonstrated
in EBV-associated gastric cancer [42, 43]. A comprehensive
knowledge of hypermethylated and downregulated TSGs is
not only important for the development of clinical strategies
of NPC prevention and therapy, but hypermethylated TSGs
can also be used as diagnostic biomarkers for NPC risk
assessment, early detection and prognosis [41]. Many key
TSGs for instance p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) that are
frequently reported to be mutated in 50% of all other tumors
have been shown to be wild-type in NPC [44, 45]. p16 and
Ras association domain family member 1A (RASSF1A)
were the first TSGs that were reported to be hypermethylated

NPC shows several unique features among tumors;
its regional very high incidence in Southern China and
surrounding countries and its strong association with
EBV [31]. The effort has been intense to identify possible
susceptibility genes and regional environmental factors, as
well as to understand the role of EBV in NPC pathogenesis.
Integration of these facts will help in developing prevention,
improving diagnosis and treatment [32].
The development of NPC involves the accumulation
of multiple genetic changes affecting certain tumor
suppressor genes (TSG) or oncogenes thus promoting the
clonal evolution of the neoplastic cell, like in many other
cancers [33]. TSGs are suggested to play a key role in
the transformation of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells into
malignant ones [19, 34, 35]. Similarities of patterns in the
chromosomal abnormalities have been reported in the NPC
from different geographical regions [33]. Chromosome
3p21.3 was the first tumor suppressive region mapped

in NPC [46, 47]. Expression of p53 has also been reported to
be deregulated by ubiquitination because of the methylation
dependent silencing of UCHL1 - a TSG in NPC [48].
Furthermore hypermethylation of several other TSGs such as
retinoic acid receptor β2 (RARβ2), death-associated protein
kinase (DAPK), deleted in lung and esophageal cancer 1
(DLEC1) has also been reported in NPC [41, 49–51].
Our established approach was tested here, namely
NotI microarray which is a screening method for
aberrantly methylated CpG-rich regions in the DNA
using methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. It was
applied to chromosome 3, which is one of the regions
always affected in NPC as well as in many other epithelial
cancers [52, 53]. With this screening, ten high scoring
candidate genes were identified of which ITGA9 was
verified to be methylated and downregulated in NPC
tissue samples and NPC cell lines at mRNA and protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels, which correlated to methylation status of its
control regions. Methylation of ITGA9 gene promoter was
observed in NPC tumor biopsies despite the challenge of
contamination by normal stromal tissue. It suggests that
ITGA9 gene potentially could have important functions in
tumor tissue organization and its epigenetic inactivation
appears to be a major mechanism for its loss of expression
in NPC.
The ITGA9 gene is located in the 3p21.3–22.2
segment of chromosome 3 [54, 55] and encodes an
integrin subunit, α9. This is a 1035 amino acid polypeptide
with a large N-terminal extracellular domain with seven
conserved repeats, a transmembrane segment and a
short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The α9 subunit forms
heterodimers only with the β1 chain forming a unique
integrin, α9β1, widely expressed in the human airway
epithelial cells, and binding to a variety of ligands [56].

The α9β1 integrin receptor plays an integral role in
different signal transduction pathways controlling cellular
proliferation and differentiation. Integrin α9β1 has been
reported to mediate cell migration in glioblastoma [57].
In ITGA9 knockout mice, abnormal proliferation and
differentiation of keratinocytes suggest its role in these
cellular processes [58]. The role of ITGA9 and its ligands
in NPC development deserve further investigation.
Downregulation of ITGA9 has been reported in
human papilloma virus associated head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma [59], non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
[60, 61], leukoplakia, lichen planus, and oral squamous
cell carcinoma [62, 63]. Hypermethylation of ITGA9 was
found in tumor samples from breast, kidney, cervix, ovary,
lung, prostate [30], colorectal cancer [64], hepatocellular
carcinoma [65] and premalignant cervical lesions [66].
In another study hypermethylation of ITGA9 at its first
intron has been reported to be the major mechanism for its
downregulation in breast cancer [67]. Our data is consistent
with these findings. Mutations in ITGA9 are a less frequent
event while its downregulation is considered to be more
important in tumorigenesis [68]. However in contrast to the
downregulation of ITGA9 in some cancers it has also been
found to be abundantly expressed in small cell lung cancers
(SCLC) primary tumors and cell lines where it has been
suggested to play a role in metastasis, in the progression to
more malignant phenotypes [69] and to poor survival [70].
Similarly integrin α9β1 expression in breast cancer has also
been reported to be associated with poor patient survival,
increased cell migration and invasion in the breast cancer
cell lines [71].
It is interesting to compare results of this study with
the work of Law et al [72]. They investigated methylation
pattern of chromosome 3 genes in NPC cell lines, and
they described five genes (FBLN2, TMEM45A, ZIC4,
GPR149 and ETV5) as epigenetically regulated. We were
unable to find these genes to be differentially methylated
in NPC samples. This could be because we used NPC
tissue samples together with NPC cell lines for the initial
screening using NMA on chromosome 3.
We have recently evaluated the potential use of ITGA9
methylation as one of the markers in a multiplex methylation
specific PCR assay designed for the early diagnosis of NPC
patients from different ethnic and geographic backgrounds.
The results show that the assay could identify 91% (58/64)
NPC patients with 90% specificity (18/20) [73]. Our results
strongly suggest that in depth studies should be pursued to
understand the functional role of ITGA9 downregulation in
the development of NPC.

definitely be verified and they were EBV negative.
Paraffin sections from 20 cases of untreated NPC,
and 10 control nasopharyngeal tissues were collected at

both NPC tumor tissue and control epithelial tissue, also
had been sampled at the Sun-Yat-Sen University Cancer
Center (Guangzhou, China) histopathology bank. This
study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee
of Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou,
China (Reference number: YP-2009175) and the regional
ethics committee of the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden (Reference number: 00-302).
NPC DNA samples from 36 EBV positive
pathology-verified NPC patients and 18 normal volun­
teers were obtained from Institut Pasteur du Maroc,
Casablanca,  Morocco in the year 2011 (ethical approval:
No. 00-302, Stockholm, Sweden and 2010-02-15,

regions. The primers used for bisulfite sequencing of
ITGA9 and WNT7A were designed using Methprimer [78]
online software and are shown in Table 2. PCR products
were purified using Invisorb® Spin DNA Extraction Kit
(Invitek, Cat#: 1020110200). The purified PCR products
were cloned in E.coli TOP10 using CloneJET PCR
Cloning Kit (Fermentas, Cat#: K1231). Clones were
sequenced using pJET1.2 reverse sequencing primer,
24-mer (Fermentas, Cat#: SO511), a BigDye Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Cat#: PN4337035) and 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). The manufacturers’ recommendations were
followed during all the steps for bisulfite sequencing.

DNA conversion by bisulfite treatment
DNA samples from NPC patients and controls
were processed for bisulfite conversion using EZ DNA
Methylation Kit (ZymoResearch, Cat#: D5001) following
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Five hundred ng of
genomic DNA was used as starting material for bisulfite
modification.

5′-aza-C treatment
NPC cell lines CNE1, TWO3, C666–1 and normal
nasopharyngeal epithelium derived cell line NP69 were
seeded at 2 × 105 per well in six-well plates and – after
24 hours - cultured with 10 μM 5′-aza-C (Sigma-Aldrich).
The medium with the added drug was replaced every
24 hour. After four days treatment, DNA was isolated
for measuring the methylation status by MSP, and RNA
for evaluating restoration of gene expression by Q-PCR,
comparing with medium control.

Pyrosequencing of bisulfite converted DNA
Two subsets of CpGs within or close to the ITGA9promoter region sequenced from the clones (above;
Figure 4) were used for pyrosequencing after bisulfiteconversion. For pyrosequencing DNAs from same set
of NPC tissue and NNE samples were used as in the
sequencing of clones. They included five NPC tumors
and two control nasopharyngeal epithelial biopsies.
The bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed according
to the Pyrosequencing Assay Design Software v2.0
(QIAGEN), details of employed sequences are provided
in Table  2. Two μl of bisulfite modified genomic DNA
(∼20  ng) was used as a template in PCRs performed
with the PyroMark PCR kit (QIAGEN, Cat#: 978703)
following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
A melting temperature of 58°C was used for both the
assays. PCR amplifications were performed in 50 μl
volumes. The entire PCR product, 4 μM of the respective
sequencing primer and 2 μl of streptavidin sepharose highperformance beads (GE Healthcare, Cat#: 17-113-01),
were used for bisulfite pyrosequencing performed with
the PSQ 96 ID system with enzymes and substrates from
the PyroMark Gold Q96 reagent kit (QIAGEN, Cat#:
972804). PyroMark Q96 ID software 2.5.8.15 (QIAGEN)
was used for data analysis.

Q-PCR assays
The first-strand cDNA was used as template for
measuring the expression levels of ITGA9 and WNT7A
by mRNA quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) with the
SYBR Green I chemistry (Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix, CAT#: 4367659, ABI Inc.). GAPDH was
used as internal control. Melting temperature for Q-PCR
was 55.5°C, 58°C and 51.5°C for ITGA9, WNT7A and
GAPDH respectively. The primer sequences used for
Q-PCR are shown in Table 2. The relative expression
level was determined as 2-ΔΔCt. Data are presented as the
expression level relative to the calibrator control sample.

Immunostaining
Primary antibodies against ITGA9 (1:100
dilution; Cat#: sc-68864, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.) and WNT7A (1:250 dilution; Cat#: HPA015719,
Atlas   Antibodies) were used. Briefly, tissue sections
were de-waxed, incubated with hydrogen peroxide
for 10 minutes, incubated in retrieval buffer solution
for antigen recovery, blocked with normal serum for
10 minutes and incubated with a primary antibody for
60 minutes, followed by detection using a Catalyzed Signal
Amplification Kit (DAKO); signals were visualized using
diaminobenzidine. Non-immune goat or rabbit serum was
substituted for the primary antibody as a negative control.

Methylation specific PCR (MSP)
The sequences of PCR primers specific for
methylated ITGA9 and WNT7A [79] and the primers
for β-ACTIN that served as a quality control to amplify
bisulfite-converted DNA without distinguishing between
methylated and unmethylated CpGs are given in Table 2.
For PCR reaction, 4 μl of bisulfite-modified DNA (40 ng)
was added in a final volume of 25 μl of PCR mixture
containing 1.8× PCR buffer, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 pmol
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, primers (100 pmol each per
reaction) and one unit of Taq Platinum (Invitrogen). PCR
amplifications were performed at 95°C for 3 min, followed
by 4 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for
45 s, which was then followed by 28 amplification cycles
at 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 45 s.

Sequencing of clones derived from bisulfite
converted DNA
Bisulfite modified DNA was subjected to PCR with
primers flanking the targeted methylation-specific PCR
