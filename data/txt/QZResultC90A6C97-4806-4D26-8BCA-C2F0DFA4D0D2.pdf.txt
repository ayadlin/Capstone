Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise the majority of the tumor bulk of pancreatic
adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Current efforts to eradicate these tumors focus predominantly on
targeting the proliferation of rapidly growing cancer epithelial cells. We know that this is largely
ineffective with resistance arising in most tumors following exposure to chemotherapy. Despite the
long-standing recognition of the prominence of CAFs in PDAC, the effect of chemotherapy on
CAFs and how they may contribute to drug resistance in neighboring cancer cells is not well
characterized. Here we show that CAFs exposed to chemotherapy play an active role in regulating
the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. We found that CAFs are intrinsically resistant to
gemcitabine, the chemotherapeutic standard of care for PDAC. Further, CAFs exposed to
gemcitabine significantly increase the release of extracellular vesicles called exosomes. These
exosomes increased chemoresistance-inducing factor, Snail, in recipient epithelial cells and
promote proliferation and drug resistance. Finally, treatment of gemcitabine-exposed CAFs with
an inhibitor of exosome release, GW4869, significantly reduces survival in co-cultured epithelial
cells, signifying an important role of CAF exosomes in chemotherapeutic drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 7%
(1). PDAC is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States
and is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030 (2).
The poor prognosis of the disease is associated with late detection, aggressive tumor biology,
and poor response to available therapies. Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog, is the standard
chemotherapeutic agent for adjuvant therapy of resectable PDAC and a commonly used
agent in other treatment settings, including neoadjuvant treatment of borderline resectable
PDAC and palliative treatment of metastatic PDAC. Despite gemcitabine being one of the
most commonly used, single chemotherapeutic agents in pancreatic cancer, response rates
are poor. The vast majority of patients (74%) receiving adjuvant gemcitabine eventually
show tumor recurrence (3). This dismal prognosis shows an urgent need for greater
understanding of the complete biology of PDAC in order to develop effective therapeutic
strategies.

Current therapies focus predominantly on targeting the proliferation of the rapidly growing
epithelial cancer cells. However, many cells types, including supporting cells called
fibroblasts, contribute to the microenvironment surrounding cancer cells. Remarkably, the
majority of the tumor bulk of PDACs consists of fibroblasts (4). Fibroblasts may inhibit or
foster tumor development (5). They were previously believed to serve merely a passive role
in PDAC drug resistance, impeding drug delivery by physically blocking cytotoxic
chemotherapeutics from reaching their target epithelial cells (6, 7). This led to the
development of fibroblast-depleting therapies. Unfortunately, these therapies showed either
very small increases in survival (8) or more aggressive tumors (9). These results show a need
to better understand how fibroblasts react to chemotherapy and how they may contribute to
drug resistance, instead of merely depleting fibroblasts, in order to devise effective treatment
strategies.

Recent studies have shown that exosomes, secreted membrane vesicles that range in size
from 30–100 nm in diameter (10, 11), released from fibroblasts have been found to increase
invasive behavior (12) and therapy resistance pathways (13) in breast cancer cells. Exosomes
contain mRNA, DNA, proteins, and are enriched with miRNA (14). Several studies have
shown that exosomal-derived miRNAs promote metastases (15) and enhance endothelial cell
migration (16). Yet no studies have examined the effect(s) of exosomes derived from
fibroblasts exposed to chemotherapy.
In this study, we show that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are innately chemoresistant
and play an active role in regulating the chemoresistance of cancer cells. CAFs exposed to

gemcitabine dramatically increase the release of exosomes that increased cell proliferation
and survival in recipient epithelial cancer cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the
expression of Snail (SNAI1) as well as the Snail target, microRNA-146a, was increased in
the exosomes of gemcitabine-treated CAFs. Furthermore, suppressing CAF exosome release
in vitro reduced Snail expression in co-cultured epithelial cancer cells and reduced survival
of drug-resistant cancer cells, suggesting that blocking exosome communication may be a
promising new therapeutic strategy for patients receiving gemcitabine-based treatment
regimens.

RESULTS
Pancreatic Fibroblasts are Innately Chemoresistant

Author Manuscript

We first compared the innate drug resistance of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cell lines
created from patient-derived tumor samples with that of epithelial cancer cell lines. Patientderived fibroblasts were grown out of tumor samples obtained from patients who had
undergone surgical resection. The CAFs displayed an elongated, mesenchymal morphology,
and stained positively for fibroblast markers vimentin and α-SMA (17) (Figure 1a).
Sequencing revealed no KRAS mutation, indicating that these CAF cell lines were truly of
fibroblast origin (Supplementary Figure S1). CAFs and normal fibroblasts had greater
survival rates than chemoresistant epithelial cells (PANC1) and chemosensitive epithelial
cells (L3.6) when treated with the same dosage of the chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine
(GEM) (Figure 1b). Having shown that CAFs are resistant to GEM, we next assessed if the
increased survival of CAFs exposed to GEM could be a result of CAFs undergoing
senescence and not incorporating the drug. Therefore, we analyzed cell proliferation of
GEM-treated CAFs and epithelial cells. The most chemoresistant CAF cell line, CAF1, also
retained the most proliferation during GEM treatment, while the second leading resistant
CAF cell line, CAF2, showed dramatically decreased proliferation (Figure 1c). To further
elucidate the role of proliferation on chemoresistance, we compared the survival rate of
CAFs and epithelial cells with similar proliferation rates (CAF2 and PANC1 cell lines,
respectively). Although CAF2 and PANC1 cells both demonstrate a relatively low
proliferation rate following exposure to GEM, CAF2 cells still showed more than a 2-fold
higher cell survival rate compared to PANC1 cells following GEM treatment (Figure 1d).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that fibroblasts have an innate resistance to GEM
instead of a growth-dependent resistance mechanism.
Pancreatic CAF-Conditioned Media Increases Proliferation and Survival of Epithelial
Cancer Cells

Author Manuscript

Considering the important role of cell extrinsic factors on cell growth and survival, we next
assessed whether factors secreted by the innately chemoresistant fibroblasts could affect
proliferation and survival of epithelial cancer cells. We first determined the effect CAFconditioned media had on the proliferation of chemosensitive L3.6 cells. An equivalent
number of L3.6 or CAF cells were plated and incubated in DMEM for 24 hours.
Conditioned cell media from either the L3.6 or the CAF cells was then transferred onto
recipient L3.6 cells each day for six days. CAF-conditioned media increased proliferation of
L3.6 cells by more than 50% compared to L3.6-conditioned media (Figure 2a–b). Having

demonstrated that media from GEM-resistant CAF cells could increase the proliferation of
GEM-sensitive L3.6 cells, we next assessed if this effect was CAF specific or if GEMresistant epithelial cancer cells could also elicit this change in proliferation. We observed
that conditioned media from the chemoresistant PANC1 epithelial cancer cell line did not
elicit a significant increase in proliferation (Supplementary Figure S2). Next, we determined
if CAF-conditioned media also affected the chemoresistance of epithelial cells. L3.6 cells
were grown in either L3.6 or CAF cell-conditioned media for 6 days then treated with
100nM gemcitabine for 3 days, and cell survival was assessed. We observed that L3.6 cells
grown in CAF-conditioned media and subsequently treated with gemcitabine showed a
significant increase in cell survival compared to L3.6 cells grown in L3.6 conditioned media
(Figure 2c–d). Taken together, these data show that CAF-secreted factors affect proliferation
and drug resistance of epithelial cancer cells.

Gemcitabine Increases CAF Exosome Secretion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that can serve as important intercellular regulators of
many oncogenic properties (18). Given that CAF-conditioned media regulates proliferation
and drug resistance of epithelial cancer cells, we asked whether CAF-derived exosomes
might contribute to this effect. First, exosomes were purified from the conditioned media of
CAF cells and their size and structure was confirmed using transmission electron
microscopy as well as particle size analysis. Particles ranged from ~20nm to ~80nm in
diameter, indicative of exosomes (19), and immunoblotting of purified exosomes revealed
expression of CD81, a known exosome marker (20) (Figure 3a; Supplementary Figure S3).
We next assessed the effect gemcitabine treatment had on exosome release in CAFs.
Samples obtained from the media of gemcitabine-treated CAFs displayed a more intense
CD81 band by immunoblotting than untreated CAFs, suggesting a greater number of
exosomes were present in the media of GEM treated CAFs (Figure 3a). To investigate this
further, CAFs were transduced with a lentiviral vector that allowed the visualization of
exosomes by labeling CD63, a known exosome marker (20), with Green Fluorescent Protein
(GFP). Upon gemcitabine treatment, CAFs displayed increased levels of GFP expression
(Figure 3b–c), suggesting that GEM treatment caused augmented levels of CD63 expression,
potentially from increased exosome production. To confirm this possibility, conditioned
media was collected from untreated and gemcitabine treated CAF cell lines and epithelial
pancreatic cancer cell lines, and the number of exosomes was quantified. While all cell lines
increased exosome secretion upon gemcitabine treatment, pancreatic CAFs and wild type
fibroblasts displayed the largest increase in exosome release, significantly increasing the
amount of exosomes found in the media more than 7-fold following gemcitabine treatment
(Figure 3d). Having shown that gemcitabine caused increased exosome release from CAF
cell lines, we next assessed if this effect was observed in CAFs treated with nab-paclitaxel,
an agent that is now commonly used along with gemcitabine (8). CAFs treated with nabpaclitaxel also showed a significant increase in released exosomes compared to untreated
controls, but to a lesser extent than the release observed following gemcitabine treatment
(Supplementary Figure S4). These data reveal that CAFs increase exosome secretion during
chemotherapy treatment.

CAF Exosomes Increase Proliferation and Survival of Cancer Epithelial Cells

Author Manuscript

To determine if these exosomes released by gemcitabine-treated CAFs could affect epithelial
cell behavior we first tested if epithelial cells could naturally take up CAF-derived
exosomes. We collected media from CAFs transduced with a GFP-CD63 lentivirus (GFPCD63-CAFs). This media was incubated on L3.6 cells for 48 hours, and the cells were
imaged. We observed that L3.6 cells, as well as several other PDAC cell lines, cultured with
media from GFP-CD63-CAFs were positive for GFP-expression, indicative of exosome
uptake (21) (Figure 4a; Supplementary Figure S5).

Author Manuscript

Having confirmed that epithelial cells could uptake CAF-derived exosomes, we next studied
the effect gemcitabine-treated CAF exosomes have on cell behavior in recipient cells.
Equivalent numbers of CAFs were plated in exosome free media and then treated with PBS
or 1µM gemcitabine for the same duration of time. Exosomes were then isolated from the
CAF cell conditioned media and added to the epithelial cancer cell lines. Exosomes derived
from gemcitabine-treated (GT) CAFs significantly increased epithelial cell proliferation and
chemoresistance more than exosomes derived from untreated CAFs (Supplementary Figure
S6). Therefore, we further assessed the role of GT-CAF-derived exosomes in regulating
epithelial cell proliferation and chemoresistance in both chemosensitive and chemoresistant
PDAC cell lines. GT-CAF exosomes increased both proliferation (Figure 4b) and survival
(Figure 4c) of chemosensitive epithelial L3.6 cells. In contrast, exosomes from GTchemoresistant-epithelial-PANC1 cell exosomes did not elicit the same response (Figure 4b–
c). Further, GT-CAF exosomes also increased proliferation and survival of chemoresistant
PANC1 and AsPC1 cells (Figure 4d–e). Thus, these data indicate that exosomes released by
gemcitabine-treated CAFs are capable of increasing proliferation and survival in recipient
epithelial cells.

Pancreatic CAFs Alter Snail and miR-146a Expression during Gemcitabine Treatment

Author Manuscript

Prompted by these results, we next sought to investigate the molecular mechanism
responsible for the ability of exosomes derived from gemcitabine-treated CAFs to increase
proliferation and survival in recipient epithelial cells. To elucidate this, we first sought to
determine how pancreatic fibroblasts are innately chemoresistant. CAFs were treated with
gemcitabine, and the expression levels of miRNAs were analyzed via miRNA-Seq. We
observed that fibroblasts showed a marked increase in microRNA-146a (miR-146a)
expression following gemcitabine treatment (Supplementary Table S1). To further
investigate this, we utilized RT-PCR to determine the expression of miR-146a in CAFs
treated with gemcitabine compared to untreated CAFs. Gemcitabine-treated CAFs
demonstrated significantly higher expression of miR-146a compared to untreated CAFs
(Figure 5a). miR-146a is directly regulated by the promoter binding transcription factor,
Snail, which promotes chemoresistance, EMT, and metastasis (22). Therefore, we
investigated if gemcitabine treatment of CAFs caused increased expression of Snail. Indeed,
gemcitabine exposure also increased Snail expression in CAFs (Figure 5a). Furthermore,
knockdown of Snail expression using siRNA caused downregulation of miR-146a
expression in CAFs (Figure 5b). These data establish a gemcitabine-induced upregulation of
the Snail pathway in CAFs.

Gemcitabine Increases the Secretion of Both miR-146a And Snail through Pancreatic CAF
Exosomes
Since GEM upregulates Snail and miR-146a expression in PDAC CAFs and GT-CAF
exosomes increase proliferation and survival in epithelial cells, we next investigated if Snail
and miR-146a could be delivered to cells through GT-CAF exosomes. Since exosomes
contain both microRNAs and mRNA (14) we first tested if both miR-146a and Snail mRNA
were increased in GT-CAF-derived exosomes. We observed that gemcitabine treatment
increased the amount of both miR-146a and Snail mRNA in CAF-derived exosomes (Figure
5c). Furthermore, the addition of GT-CAF exosomes to epithelial cell media also increased
the levels of Snail mRNA (Figure 5d) and miR-146a (Figure 5e) within recipient
chemosensitive and chemoresistant epithelial cells. Thus, our data reveal that exosomes
produced by gemcitabine-treated CAFs augment Snail and miR-146a levels in epithelial
cells.

Blocking CAF Exosome Secretion Reduces PDAC Cell Survival

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Having shown that chemotherapy treatment of CAFs causes the increased secretion of
chemoresistance-inducing exosomes, and increased cell survival, we next assessed whether
blocking exosome secretion would sensitize PDAC cells to gemcitabine. First, we assessed
whether physically removing exosomes from CAF-condition media would affect its ability
to increase cell survival in epithelial cells following exposure to gemcitabine. AsPC1 cells
were cultured in CAF-conditioned and exosome-depleted CAF-conditioned media.
Exosome-depleted conditioned media was spun down at 120,000× g to pellet exosomes
without depleting the media of proteins. We observed that culturing AsPC1 cells in CAFconditioned media, compared to AsPC1-conditioned media, led to greater survival rate
during GEM treatment; however, this survival rate was significantly reduced when exosomes
in CAF-conditioned media were removed (Figure 6a). Having shown that physically
removing exosomes from CAF-conditioned media reduced its ability to increase
chemoresistance, we next sought to determine if a compound that pharmacologically blocks
exosome secretion would elicit the same effect. Therefore, the drug, GW4869, which blocks
exosome secretion (23), was utilized to block CAF exosome release in vitro and determine
its impact on epithelial cell survival. First, we determined if GW4869 could successfully
block exosome secretion in CAFs. We found that GW4869 decreased CAF exosome
secretion by ~70% in vitro in both untreated and gemcitabine treated CAFs (Figure 6b).
Furthermore, we found that depletion of exosomes from CAF-conditioned media, using
GW4869 treatment or centrifugation, significantly reduced expression of both Snail (Figure
6c) and miR-146a (Figure 6d) in recipient epithelial cells receiving the CAF-conditioned
media. Next, we utilized co-culture studies to assess if GW4869 treatment of CAFs would
affect cell survival in recipient epithelial cells. CAFs were plated on permeable inserts above
chemoresistant or chemosensitive epithelial cells. While cells co-cultured with CAFs
showed a significantly increased survival rate following exposure to gemcitabine, blocking
CAF exosome secretion using GW4869 treatment significantly reduced this survival benefit
in multiple cell lines (Figure 6c; Supplementary Figure S7).
Lastly, we utilized a subcutaneous model to determine the effect of blocking exosome
secretion with GW4869 on tumor growth in vivo. CAFs and AsPC1 cells were

subcutaneously implanted into NOD/SCID mice and treated with PBS (control),
gemcitabine, or GW4869 alongside gemcitabine (100mg/kg body weight) twice weekly for
two weeks. Tumors of control mice and mice treated with gemcitabine steadily increased in
size over time, while tumors of mice given combination therapy (GW4869 and gemcitabine)
remained relatively the same size, displaying significantly reduced growth rate 10 days after
treatment compared to control (Supplementary Figure S8). Taken together, these data
suggest that GT-CAF derived exosomes are a key regulator of PDAC cell chemoresistance;
however, blocking exosome release may circumvent increased chemoresistance caused by
exosome-mediated signaling (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

In this study, we show that exosomes from CAFs exposed to chemotherapy are critical
regulators of epithelial cancer cell proliferation and survival. We first established that CAFs
are innately resistant to gemcitabine. Next, we determined that CAF-conditioned media
supported epithelial cell growth and survival during gemcitabine treatment. More
importantly, we demonstrate that gemcitabine-treated CAFs prolifically secrete exosomes
that contain chemoresistance-promoting factors like mRNA and microRNA to recipient
epithelial cells. miR-146a levels were highly increased in CAFs during gemcitabine
treatment and found within these exosomes, along with mRNA of its upstream transcription
factor, Snail. PDAC epithelial cells treated with gemcitabine-treated CAF exosomes
displayed increased levels of Snail mRNA, increased proliferation, and increased
chemoresistance. Finally, reduction of exosome release suppressed the chemoresistance
promoting abilities of CAF cells.

Gemcitabine is the standard of care for adjuvant therapy of resectable PDAC and is still one
of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents used in combination therapy. However,
74% of patients receiving adjuvant gemcitabine eventually relapse (3). Moreover,
gemcitabine has already proven to be a paradoxical drug as it not only promotes Snail
expression, but also triggers NFκB activation, CXCR4 expression, induction of reactive
oxygen species, upregulation of cancer-stem cell markers and AKT activity. Together, these
undesired side effects lead to increased chemoresistance and cell motility (24–28). We show
a previously unknown tumor-promoting side effect of gemcitabine treatment. In our study
we observe that gemcitabine treatment causes CAFs to greatly increase the secretion of
chemoresistance-promoting exosomes. This evidence suggests that gemcitabine may
promote chemoresistance through both cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic mechanisms.
Gemcitabine was previously shown to upregulate expression of the transcription factor Snail
in PDAC cancer cells (29). Inhibiting Snail suppresses tumor growth, metastasis, and
chemoresistance in many cancers, including PDAC (29, 30). Our data, showing gemcitabine
increases Snail expression in pancreatic CAFs, provides new evidence that Snail plays a role
in mediating chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer fibroblasts in addition to pancreatic
cancer epithelial cells. Further, our data showing that gemcitabine induces hypersecretion of
Snail mRNA through exosomes is a previously unknown potential mechanism of cellextrinsic chemoresistance.

Recent studies show oncogenic exosomes can promote invasion (12), deliver oncogenic
DNA to normal cells (31), increase drug resistance of cancer cells (32, 33), and can prime
distant organs for metastasis (34–36). Recent data show that that exosomes from cancerassociated fibroblast play a role in promoting chemoresistance in colorectal and breast
cancer cells (32, 33). In our study, we show new evidence that gemcitabine treatment of
cancer-associated fibroblasts causes increased release of chemoresistance promoting
exosomes. Based on evidence that the tumor bulk in PDAC is comprised mostly of
fibroblasts (4), it is possible that the role of CAF-derived exosomes may be even more
important in pancreatic cancer than other cancers. Our data supports the exploration of using
exosome secretion inhibitors in combination with currently approved therapeutic regimens
to combat chemoresistance. GW4869 was shown to greatly diminish CAF exosome
secretion as well as alleviate chemoresistance in co-cultured cancer cells in vitro and
contributed to suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Further in vivo studies are needed to fully
explore the potential benefit of using GW4869 to increase efficacy of combination
treatments. This would include testing GW4869 and various chemotherapy combinations on
autochthonous PDAC mouse models and monitoring tumor growth and survival.
In conclusion, we show that fibroblasts exposed to chemotherapy play an active role in
promoting proliferation and chemoresistance of cancer cells through exosome signaling. The
role of exosomes in PDAC chemoresistance is an area that requires much elucidation.
Currently available therapeutic regimens may have greater efficacy when treatments
designed to inhibit exosome secretion are utilized.

Cells were authenticated by IDEXX RADIL™ and were found to be mycoplasma free and
did not genetically match any cell line in the DSMZ database. Cells used in experiments
ranged from passage 2–10. Fibroblast nomenclature was reduced for purposes of simplicity
with “CAF1” referring to UH1301-63 cells, “CAF2”referring to UH1303-02 cells, and
“CAF3” referring to UH1303-49 cells. SC00A5 cells are wild-type pancreatic fibroblasts
purchased from VitroBioPharma. Cells were grown in culture according to standard

Exosome Collection, Detection, and Quantification

Author Manuscript

Collection—Cells were grown in exosome-free media. Media from cells was collected,
cells were washed with 3ml PBS, and PBS was collected. Media and PBS together was spun
down at 1,200 RPM for 5 minutes, supernatant was spun down at 16,500× g for 20 minutes,
and exosomes in supernatant were isolated with the ExoQuick-TC™ system according to
System Bioscience’s protocol: https://www.systembio.com/downloads/
Manual_ExoTC_WEB.pdf. Exosome pellets were resuspended PBS.
Transmission Electron Microscopy—Exosomal protein was measured via a BCA
assay, and 10µg exosomes were placed on copper grid. Exosomes were wicked off to create
a thin layer prior to addition of a thin layer of 2% uranyl acetate in water. Grids were
allowed to dry overnight, and TEM performed the next day
Particle Size Analysis—Exosomes were resuspended in PBS and particle sizes were
measured using the Beckman Coulture® Delsa™ Nano S Particle Analyzer which uses the
Brownian motion of particles and dynamic light scattering to measure particle diameters.

Western Blot—Exosomes were isolated with ExoQuick-TC™ from 20ml of cellconditioned media and protein blotting was performed according to the manufacture’s
protocol and standard procedures: https://www.systembio.com/downloads/
Manual_ExoTC_WEB.pdf.

Author Manuscript

Quantification—Exosomes were quantified using light transmission spectroscopy, as
previously described (38) measuring number of particles 30–150nm in diameter. For relative
quantification exosome pellets were resuspended in 200µl PBS and incubated with 10µM
CFSE at 37°C for 2 hours. Relative fluorescent units were measured via the Molecular
Devices SpectraMax® M3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. Total corrected cell fluorescence
used to quantify CD63-GFP labeled cells was obtained using ImageJ, wherein corrected
total cell fluorescence=integrated density-(area of fluorescent cells × mean of background
fluorescence)
In Vitro Exosome Transfer, Media Transfer, and Co-culture
Exosome Treatment—Cells were plated at 500,000 cells/flask in exosome-free media
and were either treated with 1µM gemcitabine or PBS for 4 days. Exosome pellets were
collected with ExoQuickTC (see protocol link above) and resuspended in 400µl PBS.
Recipient cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with new media and10µl exosomes
per day for 6 days.

Media Transfer—Both donor and recipient cells were plated at 60,000 cells per well in 6
well plates, the donor media was spun down at 1,200 RPM for 5 minutes, and the
supernatant was transferred to recipient cells each day for 6 days. Cells were then treated
with gemcitabine or PBS for 3 days prior to cell quantification. In studies with AsPC1 cells,
CAFs and AsPC1 cells were plated at one million cells cells/flask in exosome free media
and conditioned media was collected and spun down at either 16,500× g for 20 minutes or
16,500× g for 20 minutes as well as 120,000× g for 70 minutes to deplete the media of
exosomes without depletion of proteins. Cells were grown in conditioned media for four
days, treating with new conditioned media each day, then treated with 1µM gemcitabine for
three days while in conditioned media prior to quantification of live cells.

Author Manuscript

Co-culture—Cells were plated in a 12-well plate and on 12-well Transwell® polyester
permeable supports (Corning) with 0.4µm pore size. Cells were co-cultured for 3–6 days
while cells on the permeable support were treated with GW4869 (20µM) or DMSO, and
then cells below the support were treated with gemcitabine (100nM–1µM) for 3 days prior to
quantification of live cells. The number of cells plated per well and concentration of
gemcitabine used was dependent upon the previously determined chemosensitivity of the
cell lines (39) and cell proliferation rate. Cells on permeable supports were treated with
20µM GW4869 or DMSO once every 3 days. Permeable supports of the control group
received either media alone or media + GW4869. Epithelial cells treated with CD63-GFPlabelled CAF-conditioned media were incubated in new conditioned media each day for two
days prior to washing the cells and imaging. CD63-GFP CAFs were grown in phenol red
free media for 24 hours, media was spun at 16,500× g for 20 minutes, and supernatant was
placed onto recipient cells.

Statistical Analyses

Author Manuscript

Five biological replicated were utilized in MTT assays. Six biological replicates were used
in mouse studies. All other studies utilized three biological replicates. RT-PCR experiments
also utilized three technical replicates. Sample sizes were determined to ensure adequate
power to detect a pre-specified effect size when applicable based on previously generated
data. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance was
calculated via Microsoft Excel using a Student t test (one-sided) or ANOVA as appropriate.
Data generated displayed normal distribution with similar variances, and analysis was
performed assuming equal variances. * Denotes p-value<0.05 **denotes p-value<0.01

Figure 7.

Schematic overview of CAF exosome signaling during gemcitabine treatment. Gemcitabine
treatment leads to upregulation of Snail and miR-146a as well as exosome secretion in CAFs
that could lead to increased cell proliferation, tumor growth, and chemoresistance of
adjacent cancer epithelial cells. GW4869 suppresses exosome release and therefore
exosomal transfer of Snail and miR-146a.
