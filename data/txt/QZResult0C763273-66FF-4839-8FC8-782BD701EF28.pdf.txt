Abstract
Down Syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. It
occurs in approximately 1/750 live births and presents with many clinical phenotypes including a
reduced incidence of solid tumours1,2. Recent work using the Ts65Dn model of DS, that has

orthologs of approximately 50% of the genes on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), has suggested
that three copies of the ETS23 or Down Syndrome candidate region 1 (DSCR1) genes4 (a
previously known suppressor of angiogenesis5,6) is sufficient to inhibit tumour growth. We have
used the Tc1 transchromosomic mouse model of DS9 to dissect the contribution of extra copies of
genes on Hsa21 to tumour angiogenesis. This mouse expresses approximately 81% of Hsa21
genes but not the human DSCR1 region (Supplementary Fig. 1). We transplanted B16F0 and
Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumour cells into Tc1 mice and showed that growth of these
tumours was reduced substantially when compared to wild-type littermate controls. Furthermore,
tumour angiogenesis was repressed significantly in Tc1 mice. In particular, in vitro and in vivo
angiogenic responses to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were inhibited. Examination
of the genes on the segment of Hsa21 in Tc1 mice identified putative anti-angiogenic genes
(ADAMTS17,8 and ERG9) and novel endothelial cell-specific genes10, never shown before to be
involved in angiogenesis (JAM-B11 and PTTG1IP) that, when overexpressed, are responsible for
the inhibition of angiogenic responses to VEGF. Three copies of these genes within the stromal
compartment reduced tumour angiogenesis providing an explanation for the reduced tumour
growth in DS. Furthermore, we anticipate that, in addition to the candidate genes that we show to
be involved in the repression of angiogenesis, the Tc1 mouse model of DS will likely allow for the
identification of other endothelial-specific anti-angiogenic targets relevant to a broad spectrum of
cancer patients.
Down Syndrome, or trisomy 21, is responsible for developmental abnormalities, mental
retardation, cardiovascular defects and dementia1. As well as these phenotypes, which have
been well documented in DS, three independent studies have drawn attention to the fact that
malignant solid tumours are under-represented when compared to age- and sex-matched
individuals from the general population1,2,12. This phenotype is likely due to “gene dosage”
effects i.e. an extra copy of Hsa21 leads to higher levels of gene product that protect DS
individuals from solid tumour growth.

Orthology to Hsa21 is found on three mouse chromosomes: Mmu16, Mmu17 and Mmu10,
with 29 genes found on Hsa21 not being represented in the mouse (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Early transgenic mouse models, including the Ts65Dn model which contains orthologs of up
to only 50% of the genes located on Hsa21, have been used to study the reduced solid
tumour malignancies3. However, the contribution of trisomy 21 specifically to angiogenesis,
a process essential for solid tumour growth was not possible to examine in this system since
all cells, including both the tumour cells and stromal cells, were potentially trisomic. We
used the Tc1 mouse model of DS that has 81% of Hsa21 genes, but lacks duplication of 29
genes including DSCR1, to test specifically the effect of this additional segment of
chromosome 21 on tumour neovascularisation (Supplementary Fig. 1).
To demonstrate whether Tc1 mice were protected from solid tumour growth, we examined
the growth of B16F0 and LLC tumour xenografts. Tumour growth of both B16F0 and LLC
was significantly repressed in Tc1 mice when compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 1a).
Additionally, LLC tumour growth kinetics were significantly slower in Tc1 mice especially
at larger tumour sizes which require neovascularisation rather than vessel co-option13
(Supplementary Fig. 2). To confirm this phenotype was not the result of a disproportionate
increase of Mmu 10, 16 and 17 relative to the ploidy of the tumour cells, we examined the
chromosomes in the B16F0 and LLC cell lines. Mmu 10, 16 and 17 were found to be correct
relative to the ploidy (Supplementary Fig. 3). These observations confirm that three copies
of chromosome 21 genes suppress the growth of tumours through reduced tumour
neoangiogenesis.
To address specifically the contribution of tumour angiogenesis to this phenotype, the
tumour vasculature was examined. The additional Hsa21 fragment in Tc1 mice induced a

significant and substantial decrease in tumour blood vessel density in both B16F0 and LLC
tumours when compared to tumours grown in wild-type littermate controls (Fig. 1b).
Dextran-FITC perfused blood vessel numbers were decreased also in Tc1 mouse tumours
(Fig. 1c). In contrast, examination of blood vessel density in unchallenged skin and other
organs from wild-type control and Tc1 mice showed no difference between the genotypes
(Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that pathological angiogenesis, but not
normal blood vessel density, is negatively affected by the Hsa21 fragment. In addition, the
growth of Tc1 endothelial cells was not affected by the additional Hsa21 fragment14
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Furthermore, the differences in tumour vascularity were not due to
differences in immune-cell infiltration between the genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 6) and
the contribution of Tc1-bone marrow derived cells to tumour growth was not apparent
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Taken together, our data from Tc1 mice suggest that it is the
presence of an additional copy of a fragment of Hsa21, within blood vessels, that inhibits
solid tumour growth and, importantly, represses tumour angiogenesis.
To assess whether the decreased tumour angiogenesis observed in the Tc1 mice was due to
reduced sensitivity to VEGF, we performed in vivo growth factor-induced angiogenesis
assays. VEGF-mediated neovascularisation was reduced significantly in the Tc1 mice when
compared with littermate controls (Fig. 2a). PBS-treatment resulted in similar baseline
angiogenic responses in both genotypes (data not shown). In addition to the lack of in vivo
angiogenesis, Tc1 aortic rings were also unresponsive to VEGF-stimulation when compared
with VEGF-treated wild-type controls. Baseline responses to PBS were not affected in the
Tc1 aortic rings indicating further that an additional copy of the fragment of Hsa21
specifically suppresses VEGF-induced neovascularisation (Fig. 2b).

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a major pro-angiogenic growth
factor receptor15. VEGF, via VEGFR2, induces ERK1/2 (p42/p44) phosphorylation and
mediates endothelial cell activation during angiogenesis and inhibition of VEGFR2 or the
ERK1/2 pathway reduces VEGF-mediated angiogenic responses16. ERK1/2 phosphorylation
was reduced specifically in response to VEGF, but not basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), in Tc1 endothelial cells when compared with wild-type controls and in VEGFstimulated primary cells isolated from individuals with DS (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary
Fig. 8). This specific response to VEGF focused our attention on VEGFR2.
Although other molecules, such as DYRK1A, have been reported to be upstream of ERK
signalling17, and may contribute to the decreased ERK-phosphorylation in response to
VEGF, we show that surface levels, but not total levels, of VEGFR2 are substantially
increased in Tc1 endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Interestingly, after VEGF
stimulation the surface levels of VEGFR2 remain consistently higher on Tc1 endothelial
cells than on control cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c). This discrepancy between total VEGFR2
and surface VEGFR2 levels identifies that Tc1 endothelial cells have lower cytoplasmic
levels of VEGFR2. Indeed, immunofluorescence examination of endothelial cells in culture
show that stimulation of wild-type cells with VEGF induced an apparent internalisation of
phosphorylated VEGFR2 that was not present in Tc1 endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig.
9c). The phosphorylated VEGFR2 in Tc1 endothelial cells appeared to be restricted at the
cell surface after VEGF-stimulation. Although beyond the scope of the study, it is tempting
to speculate that defects in VEGFR2 subcellular localisation are relevant to the repressed
angiogenesis in Tc1 mice and provide a novel aspect to the regulation of angiogenesis in
DS18,19.
We identified several putative anti-tumourigenic, anti-angiogenic and endothelial cellspecific genes expressed on Hsa21 in the Tc1 mice likely to be responsible for the decreased
angiogenic responses. These included ETS2, a transcription factor whose overexpression

reduces tumour growth in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS and other models3,20 but not yet
linked with angiogenesis; ADAMTS1, a protease known to inhibit angiogenesis7,8,21; three
endothelial cell-specific Hsa21 genes: ERG, a transcription factor implicated in endothelial
tube formation and angiogenesis9, JAM-B a cell–cell adhesion molecule not yet implicated
in angiogenesis or tumourigenesis and PTTG1IP, which is overexpressed in cancers but also
not yet linked to angiogenesis. All mouse transcripts were expressed in Tc1 and wild-type
endothelial cells and human transcripts only in the Tc1 endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig.
10a, 10b). To test whether three copies of any of these candidate genes negatively affected
angiogenesis, we first observed the effects of depleting individual human transcripts by
RNAi on VEGF-mediated microvessel sprouting in aortic ring assays (Fig. 3). Knockdown
of the human transcripts and protein in Tc1 endothelial cells was confirmed by RTPCR and
Western blot analysis and no detectable effects on mouse orthologs were observed (Fig. 3a
and Supplementary Fig. 11). Wild-type aortic rings stimulated with VEGF showed a
significant increase in microvessel sprouting that was not affected by treatment with
scrambled (Scr) or the human-specific siRNAs against ETS2, ERG, ADAMTS1, JAM-B or
PTTG1IP (Fig. 3b). This was expected since these aortic rings lacked any human genes and
acted as a control. In contrast, Tc1 aortic rings did not show enhanced microvessel sprouting
in response to VEGF-stimulation with or without Scr-siRNA transfection (Fig. 3c).
However, using human-specific siRNAs to deplete one out of three copies of ERG,
ADAMTS1, JAM-B or PTTG1IP transcripts (effectively recreating wild-type copy numbers
for each gene) was sufficient to restore VEGF-mediated microvessel sprouting to VEGFtreated wild-type levels. Depletion of one out of three copies of ETS2 did not induce a
significant increase in microvessel sprouting in response to VEGF (Fig. 3c) suggesting that
vascular ETS2 is not involved in this response. In contrast, data from Sussan et al.3 suggest
that ETS2 is involved in the growth of spontaneous intestinal tumours in APCmin mice.
Taken together these data suggest that the effect of ETS2 is in the non-stromal tumour cell
compartment. Indeed, ETS2 has been reported to be responsible for different biological
responses in different cell types22,23,24. Our data provide an example of how the xenograft
model used in the Tc1 mice enables us to dissect the role of genes in the tumour and stromal
compartment.

To further test the gene-dosage effect of the remaining candidate genes we used mousespecific siRNAs to deplete two out of three transcript copies in Tc1 aortic rings. Using
RTPCR we showed that mouse-specific siRNAs for the candidate genes Erg, Adamts1, Jamb and Pttg1ip effectively depleted mouse transcripts in Tc1 endothelial cells (Fig. 4a). As in
Figure 3c, VEGF-treatment of Tc1 aortic rings that were either untransfected or transfected
with Scr-siRNA did not induce an increase in microvessel sprouting over untreated control
aortic rings. In contrast, targeting the mouse Adamts1, Jam-b or Pttg1ip transcripts by
siRNA promoted VEGF-mediated microvessel sprouting over and above Scr-siRNA treated
controls. Depleting two out of three copies of these transcripts (effectively reducing the copy
number of each gene from three to one) is sufficient to promote VEGF-mediated
microvessel sprouting (Fig. 4b). Together, our data show that for Adamts1, Jam-b and
Pttg1ip one or two copies of the transcript is sufficient to restore normal levels of VEGFmediated vessel sprouting, suggesting that a gene dosage effect is mediating the repressed
angiogenic phenotype in the Tc1 mice. In contrast depleting two out of three copies of the
Erg gene did not affect VEGF-mediated vessel sprouting suggesting that two copies of this
transcript are required for normal angiogenic responses.
In addition, an antibody against mouse JAM-B was injected into B16F0 tumour-burdened,
Tc1 mice. Intraperitoneal administration of this antibody increased significantly tumour size
and blood vessel density in Tc1 mice when compared with control-IgG injected Tc1 controls
(Fig. 4c). To provide direct evidence of a gene-dosage effect of JAM-B on angiogenesis we
compared angiogenesis in wild-type mice (2 copies of JAM-B) with JAM-B heterozygous

mice (1 copy of JAM-B). JAM-B-heterozygous mouse tissue showed approximately a half
the levels of JAM-B (Supplementary Fig. 12). B16F0 tumour size and blood vessel density
was increased significantly in JAM-B-heterozygous mice when compared with wild-type
mice (Fig. 4d, e). Furthermore, aortic rings from JAM-B-heterozygous mice showed a
significant increase in VEGF-mediated aortic vessel sprouting (Fig. 4f). Finally, we
compared VEGF-induced angiogenesis ex vivo using aortae isolated from wild-type and
ADAMTS1-heterozygous mice. Once again, our data showed a gene-dosage effect of
ADAMTS1 on angiogenesis and corroborate previous findings where genetic ablation of
ADAMTS1 enhances angiogenesis25 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Together, these results
confirm that one extra copy of the candidate genes on Hsa21 can provide an anti-angiogenic
effect.
Our work establishes a novel finding that three copies of individual genes in the stromal
compartment can confer a repressed tumour angiogenic phenotype in the Tc1 mouse model
of DS, supporting the notion of a ‘gene-dosage’ effect, for some genes, protecting DS
individuals from solid tumour growth1,2. In particular, VEGF-mediated angiogenic
processes are inhibited by the addition of a fragment of Hsa21 in the Tc1 mice. Our data
demonstrate that individual depletion either of JAM-B, ADAMTS1, ERG or PTTG1IP, but
not ETS2, is sufficient to restore normal angiogenic responses to VEGF. This implies that
three copies of JAM-B, ADAMTS1, ERG and PTTG1IP genes, and probably others that we
have not tested, need to be present for the overall inhibitory effect. The transchromosomic
system used in our study has a unique advantage in allowing species-specific silencing of
the third gene copy, leading to a rapid genetic dissection and pinpointing of the causative
trisomic genes. Although beyond the scope of our present study, our results imply that JAMB, ADAMTS1, ERG and PTTG1IP, but not ETS2, are upstream of a common signalling
pathway in the control of angiogenic responses.

Although we a see a similar phenotype in the Tc1 mice as Baek et al4, the mechanisms of
this regulation are likely to be different since the DSCR1 region is triplicated in the TS65Dn
mice, but expressed at normal levels in the Tc1 mice. Because of this, changes in DSCR1
mediated signalling via calcineurin are unlikely to be affected in the Tc1 mice. Indeed,
although the overexpression of DSCR1 has been shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis,
overexpression of the same gene is also thought to contribute to several pathological
defects26 suggesting that manipulation of DSCR1 downstream signalling may have limited
anti-angiogenic therapeutic potential. In contrast, our studies not only confirmed the
function of known anti-angiogenic genes on Hsa21 but, moreover, identified and tested
novel endothelial-specific genes that are anti-angiogenic when overexpressed. Our data
highlights the importance of ADAMTS1, JAM-B, PTTG1IP and other, potentially novel,
genes in controlling tumour angiogenesis. Furthermore, we have identified JAM-B and
PTTG1IP as new anti-angiogenic mediators.
Our study reveals that repression of angiogenesis by addition of a fragment of Hsa21 in DS
models can direct the discovery of novel anti-angiogenic targets, which have the potential of
being exploited pharmacologically for the development of effective gene therapy for treating
cancer.

Methods
Mice
Tc(Hsa21)1TybEmcf (Tc1) mice were generated by crossing Tc1 females with (129S8 ×
B6)F1 males9. Experiments were carried out using male JAM-B heterozygous, Tc1 and
wild-type littermate mice aged 2-4 months.

In vivo tumour assays

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

1×106 B16F0 melanoma cells or 0.5×106 Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected
subcutaneously into the scruff of test and control mice and were measured and processed for
histological analysis after 12 or 10 days of growth respectively as described previously45.
For the LLC tumour kinetic experiment, 0.5×106 Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells were
injected subcutaneously into the flank of Tc1 and wild-type littermate control mice and
tumour volume, v, was calculated by palpation (using the formula v = 0.5 × (l × w2) where l
= tumour length and w = tumour width) every 2 days up to day 16.
The anti-JAM-B antibody (clone JB4.2) was developed in Beat A. Imhof’s laboratory
(University of Geneva, Switzerland) and will be described elsewhere. For JAM-B blocking
experiments, 100 μg of JB4.2 was injected intraperitoneally every 3 days into tumourburdened Tc1 and wild-type mice. On day 12 tumours were measured and processed for
histological analysis.
Subcutaneous angiogenesis assay
Assays were performed as described previously46. Sponges were implanted into the flanks
of age- and sex-matched Tc1 and wild-type littermate control mice and the following day
the sponges were injected directly with either VEGF (10 ng final concentration) or PBS as a
control, every 3 days up to 14 days. On day 14 the sponges were harvested and fixed for
immunostaining for blood vessel examination.
Western blot analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Wild-type and Tc1 primary endothelial cells were plated into 6 or 10 cm dishes and grown
in MLEC-medium to 70 % confluence. The medium was removed and the dishes were
washed twice with PBS followed by lysis with RIPA or 1× modified sample buffer (3 %
SDS, 60 mM sucrose, 65 mM Tris-HCl, pH6.8). For phosphorylation studies, the cells were
incubated for 4 h in serum free Optimem after which half the dishes were treated with 30 ng/
ml VEGF or 30 ng/ml bFGF for 5 min at 37°C. The remainder were left untreated. The cell
lysates were sonicated briefly, centrifuged and the supernatant collected for Western blot
analysis. 30-100 μg protein for each protein sample was loaded onto 8-12 % gels and
Western blot analysis was performed. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody at
4°C (VEGFR2/phospho-VEGFR2, ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 all from Cell Signaling
Technology, UK). Anti-ADAMTS1 antibody was a kind gift from Luisa Iruela-Arispe,
UCLA. Anti-PTTG1IP antibody was raised in rabbits against the human PTTG1IP protein.
Anti-JAM-B antibody was kindly provided by Beat A. Imhof, University of Geneva). This
was followed by 1 h incubation with the relevant secondary-HRP conjugated antibody.
Aortic ring assay
This assay was performed as described previously45. Briefly, aortae were isolated from Tc1
and wild-type littermate controls, sliced into rings and serum-starved overnight in Optimem.
Aortic rings were embedded in a collagen matrix and cultured in the presence of VEGF (30
ng/ml), bFGF (30ng/ml) or PBS as a negative control or 10% foetal calf serum as a positive
control. For RNAi studies, aortic rings were transfected with various siRNAs (Dharmacon)
prior to embedding in collagen. Angiogenic sprouts were counted up to 7 days after
embedding. To confirm gene knockdown whole aortic rings were transfected with RNAi for
48 h. RNA was extracted from the aortae using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, reverse
transcribed and the resulting cDNA was used for RT-PCR analysis.

Figure 1. Tumour angiogenesis is restricted in Tc1 mice

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

a, B16F0 and LLC tumour size was reduced significantly in the Tc1 mice. Representative
tumour images are given. n=20 per group. b, Blood vessel density was reduced significantly
in tumours from Tc1 mice. Representative staining for endomucin in tumour sections is
given. n=5-10 per group. c, Perfusion of tumour blood vessels in Tc1 mice was reduced
when compared with wild-type (wt) controls. Graph shows mean number of dextran-FITC
perfused blood vessels. Arrow heads, perfused vessels; arrows, non-perfused vessels. d,
Blood vessel density was similar in unchallenged skin of wild-type (wt) and Tc1 mice. n=5
per group. **P<0.05, *P<0.01, ns=not statistically significant. Scale bars: 10 mm (a); 100
μm (b). All values are means ± SEM.

Figure 2. VEGF-mediated angiogenic responses are inhibited in Tc1 mice

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

a, VEGF-stimulated neovascularisation into subcutaneously implanted sponges, quantified
by numbers of endomucin positive blood vessels, was decreased in Tc1 mice compared with
wild-type (wt) mice. n=20 per group. b, VEGF-induced vessel sprouting ex vivo from Tc1
aortic rings was inhibited. Representative images of aortic ring sprouts are given. n=6-12
aortic rings per test. *=aortic ring, arrows = microvessel sprouts. c, Phospho-ERK1 (pp44)
was increased in wild-type (wt) but not in Tc1 primary endothelial cells stimulated with
VEGF. d, Phospho-ERK1 (pp44) was increased in normal human cells stimulated with
VEGF but not in DS cells. *P<0.01, **P<0.05, ns=not statistically significant. Scale bars:
100 μm (a); 500 μm (b). All values are means ± SEM.

Figure 3. Reduction of copy number of candidate genes from three to two can rescue the
angiogenic defect in Tc1 mice

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

a, siRNA depletion of the candidate human genes inhibited human transcript expression
levels (left panel) but not mouse transcript expression levels (right panel). b, Nontransfected (NT) wild-type (wt) aortic rings treated with VEGF (+) enhanced microvessel
sprouting compared with untreated aortic rings (−). Scrambled (Scr) siRNA or human
specific siRNAs did not alter VEGF-mediated microvessel sprouting. c, Non-transfected
(NT) and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected Tc1 aortic rings did not respond to VEGF (+).
Transfection with human specific siRNAs, except ETS2, effectively restoring expression of
two copies of the genes, increased VEGF-mediated vessel sprouting. n=20-40 aortic rings
per test. Black bars: wild-type, white bars: Tc1. **P<0.005, ns=not statistically significant.
All values are means ± SEM.

Figure 4. Reduction of copy number from three to one and rescues the angiogenic defect in Tc1
mice

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

a, siRNA depletion of the mouse candidate genes inhibited mouse endothelial transcript
expression levels. b, Non-transfected (NT) and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected Tc1
aortic rings did not sprout in response to VEGF (+). Transfection with Adamts1, Jam-b and
Pttg1ip siRNA, effectively generating one copy of the genes, increased VEGF-mediated
vessel sprouting. Transfection with Erg siRNA had no effect on VEGF-mediated
microvessel sprouting. n=20-40 aortic rings per test. c, Administration of the anti-mouse
JAM-B antibody (JB4.2) to tumour-burdened Tc1 mice enhanced tumour growth and blood
vessel density. *P<0.005, **P<0.001, ns=not statistically significant. d, Tumour volume was
increased in JAM-B +/− mice. *P<0.05. e, Tumour blood vessel density was increased in
JAM-B +/− mice. *P<0.05. f, VEGF-mediated microvessel sprouting was increased in JAMB +/− aortic rings. n=24-68 aortic rings per genotype per test. Scale bars 100μm. *P<0.05,
**P<0.005. All values are mean±SEM.
