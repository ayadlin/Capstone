Abstract
Administration of high-dose interleukin-2 (HDIL-2) has durable antitumor effects in 5% to 10% of patients with
melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. However, treatment is often limited by side effects, including reversible,
multiorgan dysfunction characterized by a cytokine-induced systemic autophagic syndrome. Here, we hypothesized that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine would enhance IL-2 immunotherapeutic efﬁcacy and limit
toxicity. In an advanced murine metastatic liver tumor model, IL-2 inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent
fashion. These antitumor effects were signiﬁcantly enhanced upon addition of chloroquine. The combination of
IL-2 with chloroquine increased long-term survival, decreased toxicity associated with vascular leakage, and
enhanced immune cell proliferation and inﬁltration in the liver and spleen. HDIL-2 alone increased serum levels of
HMGB1, IFN-g, IL-6, and IL-18 and also induced autophagy within the liver and translocation of HMGB1 from the
nucleus to the cytosol in hepatocytes, effects that were inhibited by combined administration with chloroquine. In
tumor cells, chloroquine increased autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II levels inhibited oxidative phosphorylation
and ATP production and promoted apoptosis, which was associated with increased Annexin-Vþ/propidium
iodide (PI) cells, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Taken together,
our ﬁndings provide a novel clinical strategy to enhance the efﬁcacy of HDIL-2 immunotherapy for patients with
cancer. Cancer Res; 72(11); 2791–801. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Two decades ago, recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) received
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cancer and subsequently
of patients with melanoma. High-dose IL-2 (HDIL-2) administration is associated with an objective 25% response rate in
patients with kidney cancer, as reported in the recently completed IL-2 SELECT trial (1). Almost 20% of these patients
survive more than 5 years (2–4). Attempts to improve the
response rate and/or limit toxicity of IL-2 administration by
inhibiting TNF, iNOS, or VEGF have failed. Combination with
IFN-a administration did not improve outcome appreciably (2,
3). Other efforts including vaccination (5), adoptive cellular
therapies (6), and CTLA-4 inhibition (7, 8) are associated with
both increased efﬁcacy and toxicity. HDIL-2 administration

remains the only agent with proven efﬁcacy in producing
durable complete and partial responses in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC; ref. 9).
The greatest limitation of IL-2 treatment has been the
associated side effects including hypotension as well as cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, cerebral, pulmonary, and hepatic
toxicity. These adverse effects are occasionally life threatening,
and treatment is usually restricted to specialized centers, often
resulting in early discontinuation or interruption of treatment
(10, 11). The precise mechanism mediating these side effects
has not been clear. We have proposed that IL-2 toxicity is due to
a cytokine-induced systemic autophagic syndrome. Recently,
several cytokines including type II IFN and TGF-b have been
shown to induce autophagy (12). We hypothesized that the
systemic syndrome associated with IL-2 treatment was related
to cytokine-induced autophagy and temporally limited tissue
dysfunction. The use of the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine
could limit toxicity and thereby enhance efﬁcacy.
Autophagy is a tightly regulated catabolic process involving
the degradation of cellular components through the lysosomal
machinery and plays a central role in cell growth, development,
and homeostasis (13). The role of autophagy in cancer is
complex and context dependent. In normal tissues, autophagy
is an important tumor suppressor pathway that limits oxidative stress and tissue damage that can promote cancer initiation during periods of excessive apoptotic cell death and
inﬂammation. Autophagy, however, also supports cellular
metabolism that has the potential to aid the growth of

advanced tumors with increased metabolic demands following
an "autophagic switch" (14) in developing tumors. In an
established tumor, cells are exposed to perpetual hypoxia,
acidosis, and nutrient deprivation. Increased autophagic ﬂux
enables adaptation to the hypoxic and nutrient-limited microenvironment. Increased autophagy is observed clinically in
late-stage colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, hepatoma,
and malignant glioma (15–19). Enhanced immune responses
to tumors have been observed when hypoxia-induced autophagy is inhibited by chloroquine treatment (20). Autophagy
promotes metastasis in some circumstances, enhancing tumor
cell ﬁtness in response to environmental stress (21).
Several studies have suggested that autophagy may act as a
protective mechanism in tumor cells in which cell death is
induced by chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy
(20, 22–25). Targeting autophagy has increased the antitumor
effects of individuals anticancer therapies in preclinical trials
(13). There has been very limited exploration of autophagy
inhibition therapy in combination with biologic therapy
(20, 26).
Chloroquine was used for many years as an antimalarial but
is now used most commonly in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It inhibits
autophagy by blocking acidiﬁcation of the lysosome, preventing fusion with the autophagosome (23). This results in
decreased degradation of autophagosomes, eventuating in
either apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Chloroquine has extensive biologic effects, inhibiting cellular proliferation and/or
inducing apoptosis in human and murine tumor cell lines
(24, 27). Induction of apoptosis is associated with the loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c,
activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP.
In vivo, chloroquine signiﬁcantly inhibits 4T1 colorectal cancer
growth and metastasis in murine models and induces apoptosis within the tumor microenvironment (28). Studies of
human (24, 29) and murine cancer cell lines (30) suggest that
chloroquine may exert signiﬁcant antitumor activity by inhibiting the induction of autophagy following cancer therapy.
We hypothesized that inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine in combination with HDIL-2 treatment would increase
antitumor effects and promote survival when compared with
IL-2 administration alone, enabling more effective expansion
and function of immune cells.

Materials and Methods
Animals and tumor cell lines
Female C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) mice, 8- to 10-week-old, were
purchased from Taconic. Animals were maintained in a speciﬁc pathogen-free facility at the University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute (Pittsburgh, PA) and used in accordance with
institutional and NIH guidelines. MC38 murine colorectal
carcinoma and Panc02 adenocarcinoma cells (C57BL/6 syngeneic) were purchased from The American Type Culture
Collection. Renca renal cell cancer and B16 melanoma cell
lines were gifts from Dr. W. Storkus at the University of
Pittsburgh. All these cell lines were authenticated using genomic proﬁling in March 2012 (IDEXX Radil Cell Check). Cells

were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM) medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS,
2 mmol/l L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, and 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate.
Liver metastasis model
Liver metastases were obtained by direct portal injection of
tumor cells as described previously (31). Brieﬂy, mice were
anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg, NLS animal Health) and xylazine (10 mg/kg,
NLS animal Health). The portal vein was exposed through a
small midline incision. A total of 2  105 luciferase-transfected
tumor cells suspended in 200 mL normal saline were injected.
The incision is closed with vicryl suture. Seven days following
tumor inoculation, mice were randomized into 6 groups and
received their ﬁrst bioluminescence imaging (BLI) measurement, then started receiving intraperitoneal injection of rIL-2
with or without combination of chloroquine. Clinical grade rIL2 was a kind gift of Prometheus Laboratories Inc. Untreated
control mice (UT) were injected with a comparable amount of
normal saline on the same schedule. Tumor burden was
assessed with the IVIS bioluminescence image described later.
Blood was collected by direct intracardiac puncture and
spleens and livers were harvested for electron microscopy,
confocal imaging, and isolation of immune cells.
Luciferase transfection of tumor cells and BLI
Stably transduced tumor cells expressing the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene were generated by lentiviral transfection of the pGL4
Luciferase Reporter Vector (Promega) and selected with puromycin. Growth characteristics and phenotype of the transfected cells were compared with the parental strain in vitro to
verify the absence of any effects secondary to retroviral insertion. Before imaging, mice were anesthetized by isoﬂurane
(Wester Veterinary) inhalation followed by intraperitoneal
injection of luciferin (300 mg/kg; Caliper Life Sciences). After
waiting 8 minutes to allow proper distribution of luciferin, the
mice were imaged with an IVIS 200 system (Xenogen Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Living
Image software (Xenogen) was used to analyze the resultant
data. Regions of interest were manually selected and quantiﬁcation is reported as the average of photon ﬂux within regions
of interest. The BLI signal is represented as photons/s/cm2/Sr.
Isolation of nonparenchymal cells and ﬂow cytometry
Mouse livers were minced and digested with 1% collagenase
(Sigma) solution at 37 C for 30 minutes. To obtain adequate
numbers of nonparenchymal cells, livers from 3 to 5 animals
were combined from each treatment group. The nonparenchymal cells were then isolated by centrifugation over a Percoll
gradient (Sigma Chemical Co.). Cell surface antigen expression
was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACScan)
using ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or phycoerythrin
(PE)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against mouse CD11c,
CD14, CD19, CD4, CD8, Gr-1, and NK1.1 (all from BD Pharmingen). Appropriate isotype and species-matched irrelevant
monoclonal antibodies were used as controls.

Inhibition of IL-2–Induced Autophagy Prolongs Survival

Serum cytokine determination
Blood was collected from direct intracardiac puncture at
individual intervals following tumor inoculation. Serum was
used to measure HMGB1 (Shinotest), IL-6, IL-18, and IFN-g
(R&D) levels by ELISA.
Detection of apoptosis
MC38 tumor cells (2  105/mL) were cultured in 24-well
plates and treated with chloroquine for 4 or 24 hours. Cells
were then harvested and stained with Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI; BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative analysis was conducted by
ﬂow cytometry, with 10,000 events acquired from each
sample.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining
A portion of each lobe of the liver was embedded in OCT
Compound (Miles), frozen, and stored at 80 C. Cryostat
sections (8 mm) were used for immunoﬂuorescent evaluation. In vitro, tumor cells were cultured in 8-chamber slides,
treated with 100 to 200 mmol/L chloroquine for 4 and 24
hours, ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 minutes,
and prepared for immunoﬂuorescent staining. The following
primary monoclonal antibodies were used: rabbit antihuman HMGB1 (R&D) and rabbit anti-LC3 (Novus Biologicals Inc.), rabbit-TOM-20 and mouse anti-cytochrome c
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Slides were incubated with
the primary antibody overnight at 4 C. Following 3 washes in
PBS, slides were incubated with ﬂuorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 minutes followed by Hoechst
nuclear staining. Negative controls included staining with
the corresponding isotype for each antibody and staining
with secondary antibody alone. Positive controls included
immunostaining of known positive tissues.
Protein blot analysis
Whole-cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and
transferred to 0.2 mm nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with primary
antibodies speciﬁc for cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling), caspase3, (Assay designs Inc.), LC-3 (Novus Biologicals), cytochrome c
(Santa Cruz), and b-actin (Sigma). After incubation with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at
25 C, membranes were developed with the SuperSignal West
Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and exposed to ﬁlm.
ImageJ was used to quantify the bands.
Statistical analyses
Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using the Student t test,
Mann–Whitney U test, or ANOVA when appropriate with SPSS
16.0 (SPSS) or Spotﬁre DecisionSite (Tibco). A P value less than
0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. All experiments reported here
were repeated at least 2 or 3 times with similar results with
representative ﬁndings presented.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; refs. 32, 33), ATP
quantiﬁcation, and XF Bioenergetic Assay were used and are
described in Supplementary Materials.

Results
Chloroquine, in combination with HDIL-2, promotes
profound antitumor effects, enhancing murine survival
in a liver metastasis model
In preliminary experiments, we conﬁrmed that rIL-2 inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. S1) in a murine liver metastasis tumor model that we
have developed. Although administration of 600,000 IU per
mouse rIL-2 twice a day can inhibit tumor growth, many of
these mice subsequently progress (Fig. 1A and B). Administration of high-dose rIL-2 resulted in life-threatening systemic
toxicity, which precluded administration of higher doses. We
hypothesized that these adverse effects may be related to the
widespread induction of systemic autophagy. Therefore, we
sought to determine the effects of administration of autophagy
inhibitor agent chloroquine both alone and in combination
with IL-2, in a hepatic metastatic tumor model.
Mice received 2  105 luciferase-labeled mouse colorectal
cancer MC38 cells via portal vein injection. Seven days later,
they were randomly divided into 6 groups that received vehicle
control (UT), chloroquine alone 50mg/kg/d for 30 days, rIL-2
60,000 (low-dose IL-2, LDIL-2) or 600,000 IU per mouse (HDIL2), twice a day for 5 day, with or without combination of
chloroquine. Tumor growth was measured by BLI (Fig. 1A and
B) and survival of mice was determined (Fig. 1D and Table 1).
We found that 50 mg/kg chloroquine alone only had a modest
but insigniﬁcant effect in inhibiting tumor growth (P ¼ 0.44). In
the UT control group, median survival was 31 days and the
longest survival time was 55 days. IL-2 administration inhibited
tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Low-dose IL-2
only modestly inhibited, whereas HDIL-2 signiﬁcantly inhibited, tumor growth, prolonging the resultant survival time (P <
0.01). The median survival in the HDIL-2 group was 135 days
and 44.4% of animals were tumor free, surviving longer than
150 days.
A dramatic effect on tumor growth was noted when chloroquine was administered in combination with HDIL-2.
Although BLI revealed visible tumors in all 5 mice on day 7
before treatment in the liver (Fig. 1A and B), after 5 days of
HDIL-2 and chloroquine combination treatment, only one
mouse developed tumor whereas the others were completely
eradicated (90% of animals) and survived without tumor for
more than 150 days (Table 1). Comparing the survival curves in
these 2 groups reveals a signiﬁcant difference (P ¼ 0.024). These
results suggest that the combination strategy of HDIL-2 and
chloroquine was extraordinarily effective with almost complete
elimination of tumors (Fig. 1A). Similar antitumor effects of IL-2
were observed with treatment of the pancreatic cancer cell line
Panc02 in the hepatic tumor model (Supplementary Fig. S2) as
well as the Renca tumor in BALB/c mice (Supplementary Fig.
S3). The B16 melanoma pulmonary metastases model was not
susceptible to IL-2 alone (as shown previously by us and others)
or in combination with chloroquine (data not shown).
In the clinic, one of the primary adverse effects of HDIL-2
therapy is the vascular leak syndrome resulting in ﬂuid retention associated with increased body weight. To assess HDIL-2
toxicity, murine body weight was measured before and every

loss, administration of HDIL-2 increased body weight, and
this effect was prevented by combination with chloroquine
(p < 0.05; Fig. 1C). Serum chemistry analysis suggested that
600,000IU IL-2 twice a day did not result in signiﬁcant liver
or kidney dysfunction (Supplementary Table S1), unlike that
observed in patients.

tumor cells. Translocation from the nucleus into the cytosol is
associated with release of HMGB1 into the serum (33). Systemic release of HMGB1 may be related to the induction of
systemic autophagy within tissues or cells, which are in turn
associated with the toxicity of HDIL-2. We assessed HMGB1
distribution in situ in the liver as well as its serum level. Two
hours following the last dose of HDIL-2 treatment (day 12
following tumor inoculation), liver tissues and serum were
harvested. HMGB1 distribution, in vivo, and liver tissue immunoﬂuorescent staining showed that HMGB1 was present predominately in the nuclei of hepatocytes in untreated animals,
as we have previously reported (31), but primarily located in
the cytosol of hepatocytes in HDIL-2–treated animals with an

HMGB1 staining void within nuclei. Combination of chloroquine prevented HMGB1 translocation (Fig. 2A). This result is
consistent with the change of HMGB1 serum levels in mice
under different treatments. When compared with sham animals, tumor injection temporarily increases serum HMGB1
levels within 24 hours following tumor intraportal delivery,
which then returns to normal levels (31). When compared with
the UT control group, serum HMGB1 levels were signiﬁcantly
increased in animals receiving HDIL-2 treatment (p < 0.05; Fig.
2B). Conversely, combinations of chloroquine with IL-2 significantly decreased HMGB1 serum levels when compared with
HDIL-2 alone (p < 0.05). These results suggest that chloroquine
may limit HDIL-2–induced HMGB1 release thereby decreasing
the associated systemic toxicity. Chloroquine administration
alone did not change the serum levels of HMGB1.

Similar results were observed with other inﬂammatory
cytokines. Compared with untreated control, HDIL-2 signiﬁcantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-18, and IFN-g in the serum.
Administration of chloroquine inhibited levels of all cytokines
except IL-18, which increased slightly. Thus the "cytokine
storm" associated with the systemic toxicity of HDIL-2 were
at least partially inhibited by chloroquine administration.
HDIL-2 signiﬁcantly enhances immune cell proliferation
and inﬁltration within the liver and spleen
Two hours following the last dose of HDIL-2 injection twice
daily for 5 days, liver nonparenchymal cells and splenocytes
were isolated, counted, and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Consistent with our previous study, intrahepatic leukocyte numbers and splenocyte numbers were not changed following

intraportal infusion of MC38 tumor cells (31) but signiﬁcantly
increased by administration of HDIL-2. Flow cytometric analysis suggested that HDIL-2 signiﬁcantly increased CD11cþ,
CD4þ, CD8þ, and CD11bþ cells (Fig. 3A, p < 0.004). Combination of IL-2 and chloroquine further enhanced this effect. There
was also a modest elevation of Gr-1þ/CD11bþ cells and CD4þ/
CD25þ cells as well as CD8þ cells (p < 0.05, Fig. 3B).
HDIL-2 administration induces profound mitochondrial
changes and heightened autophagy
To assess the systemic effects of HDIL-2, (1.5  106 IU IL-2
twice a day) was administered and liver and kidney tissues
from individual groups of mice were harvested and processed
for TEM. When compared with UT animals, hepatocyte mitochondria from IL-2–treated mice had disrupted outer mitochondrial membranes and absent or disordered mitochondrial
cristae. This could be a consequence of membrane provision to
rapidly generate autophagosomes as has been reported in the
setting of starvation (34) or a reaction to toxic reactive oxygen
species generated during IL-2–induced stress. Increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surrounding the altered mitochondria
were also visualized. The ultrastructure of the kidney proximal
and distal tubule cells from both control and treated mice
appeared normal (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, liver and kidney

tissue lysates were collected from tumor-bearing mice that
received IL-2 alone or in combination with chloroquine on the
day following the last dose of IL-2. HDIL-2 treatment increased
the apparent level of autophagic ﬂux with enhanced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the liver but not within the kidney
tissue lysates, suggesting resistance of some tissues to the
induction of autophagy. Chloroquine blocks the formation of
autolysosomes, inhibiting the ﬁnal steps of the autophagic
process (35). Administration of chloroquine further enhances
LC3-I/II levels in both groups of mice receiving chloroquine
alone or in combination with IL-2. Enhancement of visualized
autophagic vacuoles (termed autophagosomes) in treated
animals were not observed (Fig. 4B).

Chloroquine inhibits autophagic ﬂux in tumor cells
To determine whether chloroquine causes a similar effect on
tumor cells, LC3 punctae were assessed in both MC38 and
Panc02 cells. When compared with the untreated controls,
chloroquine-treated tumor cells exhibited intense LC3 punctae
by immunoﬂuorescent staining (Fig. 5A). Under TEM, tumor
cells appeared to have lost visible mitochondria and rough
endoplasmic reticulum while accumulating autophagic
vacuoles within the cytosol (Fig. 5B). To conﬁrm these immune
cytochemical observations, Western blottings were carried out
on whole-cell lysates collected at 4 hours following treatment
with either 100 or 200 mmol/L chloroquine and the level of LC3-

Inhibition of IL-2–Induced Autophagy Prolongs Survival

Figure 5. Chloroquine (CQ) inhibits
autophagy in tumor cells in vitro.
MC38 and Panc02 tumor cells were
cultured and treated with 100 or 200
mmol/L chloroquine for 4 hours
respectively. A, immunoﬂuorescent
staining was carried out for LC3
(green), actin (phalloidin, red), and
nuclei (DAPI, blue). Chloroquine
increased LC3 punctae in both MC38
and Panc02 cells. B, ultrastructure of
tumor cells was observed under
TEM. An accumulation of
autophagosomes (arrow) were
observed in chloroquine-treated
cells. C, Western blot analysis for

I and LC3-II assessed. A dose-dependent increase of LC3-II was
observed in both MC38 and Panc02 cells (Fig. 5C). These results
suggest that chloroquine induces accumulation of autophagic
vacuole, inhibiting autophagic ﬂux in both tumor cell lines.
Chloroquine treatment alters tumor cell metabolism
With TEM, in addition to accumulated autophagic vacuoles,
we also found altered mitochondria that disrupted outer
membrane and disordered mitochondrial cristae (arrow) in
chloroquine-treated tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). This
suggested that chloroquine may alter tumor cell metabolism.
Cells synthesize ATP solely through 2 pathways, mitochondrial
respiration (oxidative phosphorylation, OXPHOS) and glycolysis. OXPHOS is more efﬁcient, accounting for 90% of the ATP
synthesized within normal cells. According to the Warburg
hypothesis (36), tumor cells are surprisingly more dependent
on glycolysis even in the presence of adequate oxygen and
nutrients. In ATP production studies, blockade of glycolysis
with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) in MC38 and Panc02 tumor
cells signiﬁcantly diminished ATP levels but did not change
when OXPHOS was blocked by oligomycin and rotenone
(Supplementary Fig. S5). This has been attributed to both the
need for substrate for anabolism and cell division (37) as well as
the requirement of more rapid ATP generation by glycolysis in
the setting of cell stress.
To show that chloroquine alters tumor cell metabolism, an
XF bioenergetic assay system was used to explore the effects of
chloroquine treatment on the bioenergetic phenotype of MC38
tumor cells by real-time monitoring of mitochondrial respiration in which OXPHOS is measured by oxygen consumption
rate (OCR) whereas glycolysis is measured by the generation of
lactate and the consequent extracellular acidiﬁcation rate
(ECAR). MC38 cells were exposed to 100 mmol/L chloroquine
for 4 hours, after which the effects of successive addition of
oligomycin, FCCP, 2-DG, and rotenone, OXPHOS, and glycolysis rates were measured in real time. Chloroquine signiﬁ-

cantly decreased baseline OCR in a dose-dependent fashion
(Fig. 6A and B) but had no effect on baseline ECAR (data not
shown). The addition of the complex V inhibitor, oligomycin,
resulted in similar decrease in OCR with or without chloroquine addition. The mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP, restored
OXPHOS to levels above the baseline. 2-DG is a glucose
analogue that inhibits hexokinase, the ﬁrst enzyme in the
glycolysis pathway, converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Blockade of glycolysis by addition of 2-DG raised OCR
slightly within control tumor cells because of OXPHOS compensation whereas the presence of chloroquine inhibited this
effect. Addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone signiﬁcantly decreased both OCR and ECAR. These studies show that
chloroquine decreases both OXPHOS and glycolysis within
MC38 tumor cells, promoting a metabolic death. The agent
ethyl pyruvate, which we have shown has antitumor activity
and limits HMGB1 release, increased OXPHOS (Supplementary
Fig. S6), suggesting that the OXPHOS decrease is not a generalizable phenomenon attributable to antitumor compounds.
As OXPHOS and glycolysis constitute the sole energy source
of tumor cells, ATP levels were measured in the presence or
absence of chloroquine. We found that ATP levels were
markedly diminished following a short-term increase that may
have resulted from compensatory increases in OXPHOS
(Fig. 6C).
Chloroquine treatment induces tumor cell apoptosis
Chloroquine directly inhibits CT26 proliferation by inducing
apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (24). We showed that
chloroquine inhibits MC38 and Panc02 cell proliferation and
survival. The role of autophagy in tumor cell survival has not
been elucidated completely, and the relationship between
autophagy and apoptosis is complex, but in general, they are
regulated reciprocally, with inhibitors of autophagy promoting
apoptosis, perhaps by modulating mitochondrial pathways or
mitophagy. Our ﬁndings indicate that chloroquine inhibits

cells was also observed by both Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescent staining (Fig. 7C and D). In aggregate, autophagy
inhibition is indeed associated with induction of apoptosis in
these cells.

In the development of modern immunotherapy, experimentation in animal models has played an important role in
advancing clinical trials in patients (38). Interestingly, the ﬁrst
murine tumor models used to show potent antitumor activity
of IL-2 were methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas with
essentially no antitumor activity in humans with sarcomas.
Similarly, although renal cancer and melanoma are the primary
targets in humans, murine models show low activity of IL-2
alone in the Renca tumor model (although improved with the
addition of IL-12 or IL-18) and with the nonimmunogenic
murine melanoma, B16. It is perhaps best to consider, for many
of these long-term cultured tumors, that the most important
measure is of intrinsic immunogenicity rather than the tissue
of origin. The liver is the primary site for metastasis in many
epithelial tumors and, when unresectable, is associated with a
high mortality rate. An hepatic model seems to more closely
emulate metastases when compared with subcutaneous
metastasis models (31). In this study, we established a reliable
hepatic metastatic colorectal cancer model in mice using the
intraportal route for injection. Using luciferase-labeled MC38
cells, enhanced tracking and better visualization of tumor
growth is noted, allowing excellent correlation with data from
pathologic examination and gross measurement of tumor bulk.
This animal model permits sensitive detection and follow-up of
hepatic metastases in vivo, allowing us to observe long-term
antitumor effects of HDIL-2 immunotherapy and conduct
mechanistic studies.
Although the precise mechanism(s) by which IL-2 mediates
its anticancer effects is not fully understood, it is largely
believed that it is affected by enhanced delivery to and activation of cytolytic effectors within tumor sites. Notwithstanding the presence of immune effectors, effective elimination of
cancer often does not ensue, and the resistance has largely
been attributed to effector dysfunction mediated by "exhaustion" (39) or the suppressive inﬂuences mediated by regulatory
T cells (Treg; ref. 40) or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (41).
We have shown that one of the major mechanisms of resistance resides in the target cells' enhanced autophagy and
resistance to apoptosis (42). Here, we reported that administration of the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine promotes
substantial long-term antitumor effects when coupled with
administration of IL-2. We also showed that IL-2 administration, in addition, causes not only release of HMGB1, a potent
inducer of endogenous (33) and exogenous (43) autophagy, but
also electron micrographic changes consistent with enhanced
autophagy.
As a prototypic damage-associated molecular pattern
(DAMP) molecule, HMGB1 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many inﬂammatory states released following tissue
damage or injury, and is found in the serum-including cancer
(38–42) as well as other settings. In this model, we found that

Inhibition of IL-2–Induced Autophagy Prolongs Survival

Figure 7. Chloroquine (CQ) induces tumor cell apoptosis associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Tumor cells were cultured in the
presence of 100 or 200 mmol/L chloroquine for 4 or 24 hours before harvest. A, tumor cells exposed to 100 mmol/L chloroquine for 4 hours and stained with
Annexin-V/PI were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. B, Western blot analysis for cleaved PARP (C-PARP), cleaved caspase-3 showing a dose-dependent increase
in apoptosis of MC38 and Panc02 tumor cells treated with chloroquine. Numbers presented below each ﬁgure represent cleaved caspase-3/actin or
cleaved PARP/actin ratio. Results shown are representative of 3 experiments. C, protein from mitochondria and cytosol of chloroquine-treated MC38
cells were analyzed for cytochrome c (Cyto-c) by Western blot analysis, which showed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol.
Cells untreated or under serum starvation were used as controls. Numbers presented below each represent Cyto-c/actin ratios. Results shown are
representative of one of 3 experiments. D, MC38 cells were treated with 100 mmol/L chloroquine for 24 hours then stained with cytochrome c (green),
TOM-20 (mitochondrial marker, red), and Hoechst (blue). Chloroquine treatment increases cytochrome c release.

HMGB1 was released following HDIL-2 treatment and levels
in the serum decreased following chloroquine treatment. We
consider HMGB1 to be a likely candidate factor promoting
the development of the systemic autophagic syndrome.
Chloroquine has been used for over half a century in humans
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, HIV and malaria. Chloroquine inhibits autophagy by blocking acidiﬁcation of
the lysosome, preventing fusion with the autophagosome (23).
In a stressed cell, dependent on autophagy, this last step when
blocked results in increased generation of autophagosomes,
eventually undergoing either apoptotic or necrotic cell death.
Recently, several studies have shown that chloroquine has
extensive biologic effects, inhibiting cellular proliferation
and/or inducing apoptosis in human and murine tumor cell
lines such as the erythroleukemia K562 cells, breast cancer
Bcap-37 cells (44), lung cancer A549 cells (27), ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, melanoma cells, C6 glioma cells
(35), and mouse 4T1 cells. Autophagy inhibitors by themselves
are unlikely to have signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt, as only a
small fraction of the tumor cells are under metabolic stress
at a given time point. When combined with other chemotherapy agents, chloroquine enhanced cisplatin's cytotoxic
effect and induced apoptosis by increasing the levels of
intracellular misfolded proteins. In human cancer cell lines
(24, 29) and murine models (30), chloroquine may exert
signiﬁcant antitumor activity by inhibiting the induction of

www.aacrjournals.org

autophagy following cancer therapy. Chloroquine enhances
chemotherapy and radiation sensitivity in clinical trials, the
potential mechanisms underlying this enhancement are still
unclear (45). Although Noman and colleagues (20) have
recently shown that chloroquine administration promotes
the effectiveness of antitumor vaccines in a murine model,
ours is the ﬁrst demonstration that it enhances the effectiveness of a cytokine therapy. Here, we also show that
chloroquine limits autophagic vesicle degradation in vitro
in two murine tumor cell lines. (Fig. 5).
We showed that chloroquine not only limited autophagy but
also enhanced tumor cell apoptosis (Fig. 7). Induction of
apoptosis was associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of
caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. In vivo, chloroquine signiﬁcantly inhibited 4T1 tumor growth and metastasis in murine models and induced apoptosis in the tumor
microenvironment (28). Autophagy also plays an important
role in the effector–target interactions of cytotoxic cells and
can confer a survival advantage for tumor cells targeted for
cytotoxic cell killing. Autophagy may contribute to tumor
resistance and perhaps to the toxicity observed during IL-2
cancer therapy (46). Our results suggest that inhibition of
autophagy with chloroquine in combination with HDIL-2
treatment can increase the antitumor effects and increase
survival when compared with IL-2 treatment alone.

Liang et al.

Several studies have suggested that autophagy may act as a
protective mechanism in tumor cells in which cell death is
induced by drugs, and that inhibition of autophagy provides
antitumor effects alone (22–24) or synergistic effect with such
drugs (25). The role of metabolism in cancer is increasingly
being appreciated (47). With the notion that conventional
OXPHOS is suppressed, replenishing anapleurotic production
of Krebs cycle substrates, enabling anabolism, and cell division
is necessary in stressed cells. Enhanced autophagy promotes
degradation of intracellular substrates and allows generation
of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids that can promote and
enable subsequent replication. Here, we show that chloroquine
(but not ethyl pyruvate) has the additional role of diminishing
OXPHOS and limiting ATP production. This too may be part of
the mechanism important in enhancing susceptibility in combination with IL-2 therapy.
Further work must evaluate the precise immunologic
mechanisms operative in the IL-2 and chloroquine combination (Supplementary Fig. S7), deﬁning which immune effectors
(T cells or natural killer cells or both) have their activity
promoted, whether autophagic inhibition limits immune reactivity through effects on dendritic cells, and deﬁne the precise
role of HMGB1 in some of the biologic changes that we have
shown. To that end, we recently created ﬂoxed HMGB1 mice
and are testing its elimination in pancreas, dendritic cells, and
natural killer cells. Recent studies (48, 49) suggest that autophagy is required for the immunogenic release of ATP from dying
tumor cells, and increased extracellular ATP release improves
the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy when autophagy is disabled.
Further understanding of the complex biologic roles of metabolism, autophagy, and immune effectors will allow development of more effective and less toxic regimens for patients with
cancer. We have initiated a clinical protocol to test the delivery
of IL-2 with the chloroquine congener hydroxychloroquine

in patients with advanced renal cell cancer based on these
ﬁndings and our recent observations that IL-2 activated lymphocytes can themselves promote autophagy (50).
