Abstract
The potency of Abelson (ABL) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) has been demonstrated. However, ABL TKI resistance can
develop. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a combination therapy including
rigosertib (ON 01910.Na), a polo-like kinase (PLK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitor, and ABL TKIs. A 72-h rigosertib treatment was found to inhibit cell
growth, induce apoptosis, reduce phosphorylation of the breakpoint cluster region-c
(BCR)-ABL and its substrate Crk-L, and increase the activities of caspase 3 and poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This combination therapy also exerted a synergistic
inhibitory effect on Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cell proliferation and
reduced the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L while increasing that of cleaved
PARP and the H2A.X histone. Rigosertib also potently inhibited the growth of ABL
TKI-resistant cells, and cotreatment with ABL TKIs and rigosertib induced higher
cytotoxicity. These results indicate that rigosertib treatment may be a powerful
strategy against ABL TKI-resistant cells and could enhance the cytotoxic effects of
ABL TKIs.

Introduction

Although the majority of patients with CML-CP
achieve impressive clinical responses, increasing evidence
of acquired resistance to TKIs has been documented [8].
In particular, the T315I mutation seems to be the most
frequently observed resistance mechanism after dasatinib
treatment [9]. The TKI ponatinib is also effective for
patients with heavily pretreated resistant CML and for
one third of patients with accelerated phase (AP) or blastic
phase (BP) CML [10]. In the Ph-positive ALL and CML
Evaluation (PACE) trial, ponatinib inhibited the growth of
leukemia cells, including those harboring T315I mutants
[11]. Although ponatinib was developed as a BCR-ABL
inhibitor, recent studies have identified novel compound
mutations that cause resistance to ponatinib [12, 13],
indicating that mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain
may confer resistance to ABL TKIs. Moreover, ABL TKIs
cannot eradicate leukemia stem cells [14]. Therefore,
alternative strategies are needed to improve the outcomes
of patients with CML.
Mitosis is the key event of cell cycle, and polo-like
kinase (PLK) is a pivotal regulator of mitosis as well as

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated
with the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which is a
translocation of the Abelson (ABL)1 oncogene on
chromosome 9 with a breakpoint cluster region (BCR) on
chromosome 22 and is designated t(9;22) [1]. This fusion
gene encodes the chimeric oncogenic fusion protein BCRABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Imatinib,
an orally available ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI),
effectively induces cytogenic remission in patients with
CML [2]. Despite the efficacy of imatinib, some patients
develop resistance to ABL TKI therapy. Primary or
secondary resistance to imatinib has been reported to
occur in approximately 40% of patients with CML in the
chronic phase (CML-CP) [3]. Second-generation ABL
TKIs such as nilotinib or dasatinib have been shown to
induce major cytogenetic responses in approximately 50%
of patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML [4, 5]
and are currently used clinically as first-line therapies for
newly diagnosed CML [6, 7].

cytokinesis [15]. Five members of the PLK family have
been discovered in humans. PLK1, which is mainly
expressed during the late G2 and M phase, regulates
various stage of mitosis. This protein contains a highly
conserved N-terminal protein kinase domain and a
C-terminal polo box domain (PBD), which is required for
docking to other targets. PLK1 is also highly expressed
in a broad spectrum of tumors, and its expression level
correlates with poor prognosis in patients. Therefore,
high PLK1 levels are a marker of cellular proliferation in
cancers such as leukemia [16, 17].
Rigosertib, also known as ON0190.Na, is a benzyl
sulfone analogue and an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)noncompetitive, multitargeted inhibitor [18]. Rigosertib
inhibits both PLK1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) and has been investigated in clinical trials against
solid tumors and hematological malignancies such as

myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [19, 20]. Herein, we
have investigated the effects of rigosertib against Phpositive leukemia cells. We have also investigated whether
co-treatment with ABL TKIs and rigosertib would increase
cytotoxicity against Ph-positive primary leukemia cells.

Results

PLK1 is up-regulated in many human tumors,
including hematological malignancies [17]. Therefore,
we first examined PLK1 expression in Ph-positive

leukemia cell lines and primary samples as well as
cluster of differentiation (CD) 34-positive CML samples
(Figure 1A). As rigosertib is a potent PLK1 and PI3K
inhibitor, we examined its efficacy against Ph-positive
leukemia cells. Incubation for 72 h with the indicated
concentrations of rigosertib decreased growth (Figure
1B) and increased apoptosis in K562 cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1C). Immunoblotting revealed
reduced phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and its downstream
substrate Crk-L but increased caspase 3 and PARP activity
after rigosertib treatment (Figure 1D). We also observed
increased H2A.X histone phosphorylation after treatment
with rigosertib. Patients with resistance to imatinib
therapy harbor the T315I mutation [8], and we, therefore,
evaluated the efficacy of rigosertib against T315I-mutant
Ba/F3 cells. Cell growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner after a 72-h treatment with rigosertib (Figure
1E). In an immunoblot analysis, rigosertib treatment
reduced the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L and
increased both the caspase and PARP activity levels, as
well as H2A.X phosphorylation (Figure 1F).

TKI-resistant

To investigate whether rigosertib could sensitize
ABL TKI-resistant cells to ABL TKIs, a cell growth assay
was performed using Ba/F3 ponatinib-resistant (Ba/F3
ponatinib-R) cells and nilotinib-resistant K562 (K562
nilotinib-R) cells. We found that treatment with rigosertib
reduced the growth of these cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3A). We also observed increased apoptosis
(Figure 3B) and activation of caspase 3 and PARP (Figure
3C) in Ba/F3 ponatinib-R cells following rigosertib
treatment; in contrast, rigosertib reduced ABL and Crk-L
phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Further,
we investigated the efficacy of ponatinib and rigosertib
against ponatinib-resistant Ba/F3 cells. Although ponatinib
treatment did not increase the activity of PARP, cotreatment with ponatinib and rigosertib inhibited cell
growth (Figure 3D) and increased PARP cleavage, caspase
3 activity, and H2A.X phosphorylation (Figure 3E). We
further examined the efficacy of rigosertib against K562
nilotinib-R cells and found that this agent decreased
cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3F).
Rigosertib treatment also reduced the phosphorylation
of BCR-ABL and Crk-L while increasing the activities
of caspase 3 and PARP (Figure 3G). We further observed
increased cytotoxicity and reduced phosphorylation
of BCR-ABL and Crk-L following co-treatment with
nilotinib and rigosertib (Figures 3H, 3I). These results
indicate that rigosertib increases the cytotoxicity of ABL
TKIs against ABL TKI-resistant cells.

Co-treatment with ABL TKIs and rigosertib
increased cytotoxicity against Ph-positive cell lines
We tested the effect of a combination of rigosertib
(0, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 nM) and imatinib (0, 100,
500 nM, and 1 µM) on Ph-positive K562 cells. The
combination of the two drugs decreased the proliferation
of K562 cells more than each drug alone (Figure 2A).
Additionally, combined treatment with imatinib and
rigosertib led to apoptosis at a higher rate than with each
drug alone (Figure 2B). Immunoblot analysis revealed
that phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L decreased
whereas caspase 3 and PARP activities increased following
co-treatment with imatinib and rigosertib (Figure 2C) and
that H2A.X phosphorylation also increased. Furthermore,
the combination of imatinib and rigosertib down-regulated
the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell
leukemia (Mcl)-1. T315I mutant cells are resistant to
second-generation ABL TKIs. We found that co-treatment
with ponatinib and rigosertib decreased the proliferation
of T315I mutant cells (Figure 2D). A two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) revealed that these drugs acted in a
synergistic manner (Figure 2A, 2D). Combined treatment
with ponatinib and rigosertib also increased apoptosis
in T315I mutant cells (Figure 2E), and immunoblotting
revealed decreased phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and
Crk-L and increased caspase 3 and PARP activities (Figure
2F) along with increased H2A.X phosphorylation. These
results suggest that rigosertib enhances ABL TKI-induced
cytotoxicity against Ph-positive leukemia cells.

PLK1 knockdown induces cytotoxicity against
Ph-positive leukemia cells
We investigated the inhibitory effects of PLK1 on
Ph-positive leukemia cells by examining the effects of
PLK1 siRNA knockdown in K562 cells. Immunoblot
analysis revealed that PLK1 expression was completely
inhibited (Figure 4A). Subsequently, we observed inhibited
growth inhibition in these PLK1 siRNA-transfected cells
(Figure 4B) and greater imatinib-mediated inhibition in the
PLK1 siRNA-transfected K562 cells relative to the control
siRNA-transfected cells. We also observed increased
apoptosis in the PLK1 siRNA-transfected cells following
treatment with imatinib (Figure 4C). Immunoblot analysis
revealed increased PARP activity following imatinib
treatment in the PLK1 siRNA-transfected K562 cells
(Figure 4D). These results indicate that PLK1 knockdown
increased the sensitivity of these cells to ABL TKI.

regulator of mitotic progression [15]. In this study, we
demonstrated that PLK1 protein was abundantly expressed
in Ph-positive leukemia and CD34-positive primary CML
cells. These observations support the use of PLK1 as a
therapeutic target.
Because PLK1 expression is increased in CD34positive CML stem cells (Figure 1A), PLK inhibition may
eradicate these cells. We demonstrated that one PLK1
inhibitor, rigosertib, could induce H2A.X phosphorylation
in Ph-positive leukemia cells (Figures 1D, 1F). H2A.X

events that results in DNA damage [21]. Therefore,
rigosertib may induce an early chromatin modification
event following DNA damage and fragmentation. Our data
also demonstrated that PLK1 inhibition synergistically
enhanced sensitivity to ABL TKIs in Ph-positive cells. In
cancer cells, PLK1 depletion has been shown to inhibit
cell proliferation [22], perturb spindle assembly, prolong
mitotic arrest, and induce apoptosis. In this study, we also
confirmed that siRNA-induced PLK1 depletion inhibited
cell growth, increased apoptosis, and enhanced the
efficacy of ABL TKI (Figure 4C).
Rigosertib is a small molecule that induces mitotic
arrest, and we showed that rigosertib alone could induce
dose-dependent cytotoxicity in ABL TKI-resistant cell
lines. In contrast, no response was observed in ABL TKIresistant cells even after 72 h of treatment with ABL
TKIs such as nilotinib and ponatinib, when administered

alone. Other studies have reported that rigosertib alone
induces apoptosis in hematological cancer cells [23].
We demonstrated that co-treatment with ABL TKIs and
rigosertib inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis,
activated caspase-3, and altered the expression of Mcl-1
(Figure 2C).
ABL TKI-resistant patients have a poor prognosis.
Accordingly, we investigated the efficacy of rigosertib
against ABL TKI-resistant cell lines. Rigosertib is
currently being investigated in clinical trials and has
shown promising results when administered alone or as
part of a combination therapy [24]. Other PLK inhibitors
have also been investigated [25]. PLK1 inhibition by a
combination of rigosertib and ABL TKIs offers a novel
targeted anti-tumor therapy for patients with Ph-positive
leukemia.

PLK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with
Ph-positive leukemia. We also provide new information
regarding the efficacy of combined treatment with the
PLK inhibitor rigosertib and a potent ABL TKI against
ABL TKI-resistant leukemia cells.

PLK1-targeting siRNA was purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-36277). K562 cells
were transfected with PLK1 or control siRNA via
electroporation as described previously [29].

Materials and Methods

Cell viability assays
The viability of Ph-positive cells treated with
rigosertib alone or in combination with imatinib,
nilotinib, or ponatinib was measured via trypan blue
exclusion or staining with a cell counting kit solution
(Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan) followed by photometric
measurements at A450 nm to determine cell viability. The
experiments were performed in triplicate.

Ethics statement
Peripheral blood samples were collected from
patients with CML and Ph-positive leukemia after
obtaining written informed consent. The Institutional
Review Board of the Tokyo Medical University approved
this study in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Apoptosis assay

Ph-positive cell lines and patient cells

Apoptosis of the Ph-positive cell lines was assayed
using previously described methods [30]. The experiments
were performed in triplicate.

The Ph-positive leukemia cell line (K562) was
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). K562 nilotinib-R [26], a
T315I mutant Ph-positive ALL cell line (SK-9) [27], Ba/
F3 ponatinib-R [13], and T315I mutant Ba/F3 cells [28]
were established previously. All cell lines were cultured
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Fresh
peripheral blood samples were collected in heparinized
tubes from patients after obtaining informed consent.
Mononuclear cells were separated from blood using
LymphoSepare
(Immuno-Biological
Laboratories,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). These cells were used
immediately or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until used.

Immunoblotting
Immunoblot analysis was performed according
to previously described methods [31]. Ph-positive
cell lines or patient cells were incubated with the
indicated concentrations of ABL TKI or rigosertib for
the indicated time periods. Following the indicated
treatments, cells were harvested and lysed by sonication
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer.
Protein lysate concentrations were measured using a
protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
USA). Equal amounts of proteins were loaded on 4%–
20% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were
probed with the primary antibodies of interest at the
appropriate dilutions for 2 h at room temperature.
Blots were developed using an Amersham enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) plus kit (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK). The experiments with Ph-positive cell
lines were performed thrice independently.

Reagents
Rigosertib and ponatinib were purchased from
MedKoo Biosciences (Chapel Hill, NC, USA), and
imatinib and nilotinib were provided by Novartis Pharma
AG (Basel, Switzerland). Stock solutions of rigosertib,
nilotinib, and ponatinib were prepared in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). Imatinib was dissolved in distilled
water, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C. Anti-phospho ABL,
phospho Crk-L, cleaved caspase 3, and PARP antibodies
(Abs) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA,
USA). Anti-phosphohistone H2A.X and Crk-L Abs were
obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). ABL,
PLK1, and Mcl-1 Abs were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Other reagents
were obtained from Sigma chemical company (St. Louis,
MO, USA).
