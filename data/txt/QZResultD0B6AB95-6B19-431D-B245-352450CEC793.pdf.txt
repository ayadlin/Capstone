Abstract
Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is becoming indispensable to
the study of transgene expression during development and, in
many in vivo models of disease such as cancer, for high
throughput drug screening in vitro. Because reaction of
D-luciferin with firefly luciferase ( fLuc) produces photons of
sufficiently long wavelength to permit imaging in intact
animals, use of this substrate and enzyme pair has become
the method of choice for performing BLI in vivo. We now show
that expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family
transporter ABCG2/BCRP affects BLI signal output from the
substrate D-luciferin. In vitro studies show that D-luciferin is a
substrate for ABCG2/BCRP but not for the MDR1 P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/Pgp), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/
ABCC1), or multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2/ABCC2).
D-Luciferin uptake within cells is shown to be modulated by
ABC transporter inhibitors, including the potent and selective
ABCG2/BCRP inhibitor fumitremorgin C. Images of xenografts
engineered to express transgenic ABCG2/BCRP, as well as
xenografts derived from the human prostate cancer cell line
22Rv1 that naturally express ABCG2/BCRP, show that ABCG2/
BCRP expression and function within regions of interest
substantially influence D-luciferin–dependent bioluminescent
output in vivo. These findings highlight the need to consider
ABCG2/BCRP effects during D-luciferin–based BLI and suggest
novel high throughput methods for identifying new ABCG2/
BCRP inhibitors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9389–97]

Introduction
Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is the most widely used method
to measure transgene expression in vivo (1–4). Although originally
developed as a way to detect bacterial pathogens in living hosts, the
technique has been extended to monitoring tumor growth and
therapeutic response, measuring protein-protein interactions,
observing the trafficking and proliferation of immune and stem
cells, and as a method to study gene expression patterns (5).
The pharmaceutical industry has begun incorporating BLI into its
drug development programs routinely (6). The method relies upon
the administration of D-luciferin, or another suitable substrate, to

cultured cells or to an animal harboring cells engineered to express
luciferase. The most commonly used enzyme-substrate pair is
firefly luciferase ( fLuc) and D-luciferin. Upon oxidation by fLuc,
D-luciferin emits photons of a sufficiently long wavelength that they
are capable of traversing living tissue and can be detected by a
cooled CCD camera to generate an image. Its application to high
throughput screening and imaging of cell functions in intact
animals makes the technique particularly versatile and attractive.
BLI is exquisitely sensitive and specific due, in part, to the lack
of background noise with which fluorescence imaging is often
fraught, enabling the quantification of small changes in light
output magnitude and the visualization of as few as 1,000 cells
deep within a living mouse (3).
However, unlike fluorescence imaging, BLI is a complex process
that requires the presence of ATP and oxygen and generates a
signal that can only purport to be directly related to the amount of
luciferase present when the enzyme is limiting and substrate is in
excess. The readout from BLI is necessarily downstream from a
series of physiologic and cellular events. First, substrate must reach
the cytoplasm of cells, a process that may be attenuated if the
luciferase substrate serves also as a substrate for a membranebound pump, such as those produced by the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) family. Thus, experimental agents that unknowingly
modulate substrate access to luciferase-expressing cells might
alter BLI output independent of changes in luciferase activity. For
example, coelenterazine is a substrate for the MDR1 P-glycoprotein
pump (ABCB1/Pgp), as well as for Renilla luciferase (rLuc),
necessitating an understanding of how experimental conditions
influence ABCB1/Pgp activity in cells undergoing rLuc imaging (7).
Our recent efforts to apply fLuc to study several new inhibitors of
the tumor promoting hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway led us to
uncover that BLI using D-luciferin as a substrate is influenced
substantially by cell expression of the ABC transporter family
member ABCG2/BCRP. We show that changes in ABCG2/BCRP
expression and function alter D-luciferin–dependent BLI output
independent of luciferase expression modulation in intact cells and
in vivo. These findings reveal new cautions and potential
applications for BLI in living cells and tissues.

Figure 1. BLI signal in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells is enhanced by treatment with HhAntag-691, a known Hh pathway inhibitor. A, 22Rv1 cells stably transfected
with the Gli trifusion reporter (22Rv1/Gli-tri) were transiently transfected with expression vectors coding for either Gli1, a Gli transcription enhancer, with Gli3, a Gli
transcription suppressor, or both. Cell extracts assayed for fLuc expression reveal that reporter expression is Hh pathway dependent, i.e., stimulated by Gli1 and
suppressed by Gli3. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. B, 22Rv1/Gli-tri cells were treated with the Hh pathway inhibitor HhAntag-691. Luciferase assays done on cell
extracts show that HhAntag-691 inhibits Gli-tri expression in a concentration-dependent manner. 22Rv1/Gli-tri cells were treated with increasing concentrations
of HhAntag-691 for 2 d before the luciferase assay. Points, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. C, BLI of intact 22Rv1/Gli-tri cells treated with HhAntag-691 as in (B ) shows a
concentration-dependent increase in signal intensity. Top, representative plate of cells imaged; bottom : quantification of BLI. The reading in each well at 2 d was
normalized to the reading of the same well before addition of HhAntag-691. Points, mean (n = 4); bars, SE. D, 22Rv1/Gli-tri cell extracts were mixed with different
concentrations of HhAntag-691 before quantification of fLuc activity. The presence of HhAntag-691 in cell extracts does not interfere with the fLuc signal. Points, mean
(n = 3); bars, SE.

BCRP-expressing cells (10). HhAntag-691 was kindly provided by
Genentech, Inc. (11, 12).
Construction of reporter plasmids. fLuc-mRFP-HSV1–truncated
sr39tk ( fLuc-mrfp-ttk) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV-tri)
was a generous gift of Dr. S. Sam Gambhir (Stanford University) and was
prepared as previously described (13). A unique ligation strategy involving
three DNA fragments was used to generate the plasmid with the fLucmrfp-ttk gene under the control of eight tandem minimal Gli-binding sites
(Gli-tri). The fLuc-mrfp-ttk gene fragment (3.38 kb) was obtained from
CMV-tri by cutting with NheI and NotI. The 8x-Gli promoter (0.6 kb) was
derived from pGl3b/8XGli-lc-luc, kindly provided by Dr. Phillip Beachy
(Johns Hopkins University), cut with KpnI and NheI (14), and the backbone
(4.6 kb) carrying a G418 selection marker was from pGlow-TOPO-p53-1F by
cutting with NotI and KpnI. The DNA fragments were purified with QIAGEN
gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and then ligated. Gli-tri plasmids were
prepared from transformants from the ligation product and confirmed by
restriction digestion and sequencing.
Cell culture. The human prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1 was cultured in
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),

30 mg/L Na2CO3, 45 mg/L glucose, 0.1 mmol/L HEPES, and 0.01 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were cultured
in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS; HEK-293 cells
were cultured in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. All
cultures were maintained at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air
incubator.
Transfection. Transient transfection was done with Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Pharmaceuticals) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 22Rv1 cells stably transfected with CMV-tri or Gli-tri were
selected in 1.5 mg/mL G418.
Reverse transcription–PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy

fLuc assay. Cell extracts were prepared from 22Rv1 cells using passive
lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the
luciferase assay was done using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
BLI of cell lines. 22Rv1 stable transfectants were plated into 24-well
plates at the density of 3  105 per well. MDCK and HEK-293 cell lines were
transiently transfected with CMV-tri for 2 days and then plated into 24-well
plates at the same density. The following day, before imaging, each well was
changed into fresh medium containing drugs at indicated concentrations.
D-Luciferin was then added to a final concentration of 150 Ag/mL according
to the manufacturer’s (Xenogen Corp.) recommendation, and imaging
commenced immediately. BLI was done with the IVIS 200 small animal
imaging system (Xenogen Corp.). Acquisition times varied depending on
signal intensity.
In vitro [3H]penciclovir uptake assay. 22Rv1/CMV-tri cells were plated
into 12-well plates at the density of 1  106 per well. The following day, cells
were changed into fresh medium containing 1.0 ACi/mL [3H]penciclovir
(Moravek Biochemicals and Radiochemicals) with or without 5 Amol/L
fumitremorgin C, and incubated for 0, 1, and 3 h at 37jC. After incubation,

cells were washed with cold PBS four times, lysed in 250 AL 1 passive lysis
buffer (Promega), and then counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Model
LS6500, Beckman Coulter, Inc.).
In vivo BLI. Animal protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins
University Animal Care and Use Committee. HEK-293 cells with or without
ABCG2/BCRP overexpression were transiently transfected with CMV-tri for
2 days, then 1  106 cells of each were implanted s.c. into 6-week-old
female nude mice. Animals were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane during
imaging. BLI was done with the IVIS 200 small animal imaging system
(Xenogen Corp.). Within 1 to 4 days, mice were injected i.p. with D-luciferin
(150 mg/kg) and imaged every few minutes for >1 h. Fumitremorgin C
was injected by tail vein (25 mg/kg) at one point during the imaging time
course, and imaging continued thereafter. 22Rv1/CMV-tri stable cells
were implanted s.c. into mice (5  106 cells per site). When the tumors
became palpable, osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 1007D, Durect Corp.) with a
0.5 AL/h infusion rate loaded with D-luciferin (50 mg/mL) were implanted
s.c. into the contralateral side of the mice. The next day mice were subjected
to BLI, then fumitremorgin C or vehicle was injected by tail vein (25 mg/kg),
and imaging continued thereafter.
Data analysis. LivingImage (Xenogen Corp.) and IGOR (Wavemetrics)
image analysis software were used to superimpose and analyze the
corresponding gray scale photographs and false color BLI images. Signal

Figure 3. D-Luciferin is a substrate of ABCG2/BCRP. A, HEK-293 cells stably transfected with wt ABCG2/BCRP, empty vector, or mutant ABCG2/BCRP (T10 or G2)
were transiently transfected with CMV-tri and imaged in the presence of different ABC transporter inhibitors as indicated. A, shown are bioluminescent images of
cell culture plates and a corresponding schematic of inhibitors and their concentrations. B, quantification of the imaging experiment shown in (A ). Fumitremorgin C,
a potent and specific inhibitor of ABCG2/BCRP, enhances the BLI signal in cells expressing transgenic wt ABCG2/BCRP and has no effect on control cells. The
effect of fumitremorgin C is minimal in cells expressing the T10 and G2 ABCG2/BCRP mutants. Verapamil and indomethacin show mild signal enhancement, whereas
no effect was seen with doxorubicin or colchicine (Col ). Imaging was done within 2 min of adding D-luciferin to cultures. All readings were normalized to the condition
with no drug added with this baseline reading set at 1 arbitrary unit. Fumitremorgin C increased the BLI signal f3-fold at concentrations of 1 to 5 Amol/L in cells
expressing wt ABCG2/BCRP. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE.

intensities of regions of interests were defined manually. Light intensities of
the regions of interests were expressed as total flux (photons per second).

Results
Discordance of fLuc reporter function in live cells and cell
extracts. Toward our goal of imaging the pharmacologic
modulation of Hh pathway activity in vivo, we constructed a triple
modality imaging reporter consisting of the trifusion reporter gene
that produces fLuc, red fluorescent protein (RFP), and a mutated
form of herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (sr39ttk) under
transcriptional control of the Gli promoter (13). 22Rv1 prostate
cancer cells stably transfected with the Gli trifusion construct were
established by selection with G418 (designated 22Rv1/Gli-tri). The
effects of well-defined modulators of Gli promoter activity

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

validated Gli trifusion reporter function in these cells (14, 15).
When transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing Gli1, a
positive regulator of Gli promoter activity, 22Rv1/Gli-tri cells
showed an f18-fold increase in fLuc reporter expression by fLuc
assay of cell extracts (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, expressing Gli3, a
negative regulator of the Gli promoter function, substantially
inhibited fLuc expression in Gli1-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). These
results confirmed physiologic patterns of Gli trifusion reporter
expression regulation in the 22Rv1/Gli-tri cell line.
We examined the effect of HhAntag-691, a novel, clinically
translatable Hh pathway inhibitor, on luciferase activity in the
22Rv1/Gli-tri cells (11, 16, 17). 22Rv1/Gli-tri cells were treated with
HhAntag-691 (0.3–20 Amol/L) in 0.5% FBS containing medium for
48 h. Live cells were then subjected to BLI, and cell extracts were
obtained and assayed for fLuc activity, both using D-luciferin as a
substrate. As expected and consistent with its known inhibitory
action on Smoothened, an Hh pathway member upstream of Gli,

D-Luciferin

HhAntag-691 was found to inhibit Gli-fLuc activity when the
reporter assay was done on the cell extracts (Fig. 1B). Paradoxically,
HhAntag-691 potently stimulated the bioluminescence signal in a
dose-dependent manner when assayed in live, intact cells (Fig. 1C).
We initially hypothesized that these disparate results might be
explained by a direct effect of HhAntag-691 on the fLuc reaction
because the cytoplasmic concentration of HhAntag-691 might have
been higher during BLI of live cells than in the assayed cell extracts.
However, we found that HhAntag-691 had no direct effect on light
generation when added directly to 22Rv1/Gli-tri cell extracts before
quantifying fLuc activity (Fig. 1D). That this paradoxical increase in
Gli-fLuc activity in response to HhAntag-691 was only detectable in
intact cells coupled with the observation that the BLI signal
intensity was found to be dependent upon the concentration of
D-luciferin (Supplementary Fig. S1 online) suggested that HhAntag691 might increase intracellular D-luciferase substrate levels

and ABCG2/BCRP

potentially through a D-luciferin cell surface transport system,
such as an ABC transporter. To test this hypothesis, we initially
used 22Rv1 cells engineered to express the fLuc-RFP-sr39ttk
reporter under transcriptional control of the CMV promoter
(22Rv1/CMV-tri) to enable high and constitutive reporter gene
expression. HhAntag-691 enhanced the BLI signal in 22Rv1/CMVtri cells in the same way as in 22Rv1/Gli-tri cells (data not shown).
Thus, the effect of HhAntag-691 was specific to D-luciferin–based
BLI and independent of Gli promoter function.
ABC transporter inhibitors alter D-luciferin–dependent
BLI. We examined the effects of several ABC transporter
inhibitors on D-luciferin–dependent BLI in intact 22Rv1/CMVtri cells. These included verapamil and doxorubicin for ABCB1/
Pgp inhibition, indomethacin for ABCC [multidrug resistance
protein (MRP)] inhibition, and fumitremorgin C for ABCG2/
BCRP inhibition (18–21). Bioluminescence images were obtained

Figure 4. D-Luciferin is not a substrate of Pgp, MRP1, or MRP2. BLI was done on MDCK cells stably transfected with Pgp (A), MRP1 (B ), or MRP2 (C ) and
transiently transfected with CMV-tri as described in Fig. 3. Doses of ABC transporter inhibitor are indicated. Neither fumitremorgin C, verapamil, indomethacin, nor
doxorubicin altered the signal output from cells expressing these ABC transporters. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE.

immediately and every few minutes for up to 2 h after the
addition of D-luciferin to obtain the kinetics of the inhibitor
effects. Verapamil, indomethacin, and fumitremorgin C enhanced
the fLuc-mediated BLI signal in 22Rv1/CMV-tri cells similar to the
effect of HhAntag-691 in the 22Rv1/Gli-tri and 22Rv1/CMV-tri
cells (Fig. 2). Doxorubicin had no effect. Enhancement of BLI
signal by HhAntag-691, verapamil, indomethacin, and fumitremorgin C occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Verapamil and fumitremorgin C showed the strongest enhancement ( fumitremorgin C > verapamil), up to more than double the
BLI signal at the highest concentrations tested (50 Amol/L for
verapamil and 5 Amol/L for fumitremorgin C) compared with
control. These results were consistent with D-luciferin being a
substrate for an ABC transporter that pumps D-luciferin out of
cells under baseline conditions.
The three components of the fusion protein that are encoded by
the trifusion reporter system as a single transcript, i.e., fLuc, RFP,
and sr39ttk, are expressed equally despite the different locations of
their coding regions with respect to the CMV promoter (13). To test
whether the signal enhancement seen using BLI with cells treated
with fumitremorgin C was unique to BLI, we also studied the effect
of fumitremorgin C on the uptake of [3H]penciclovir in vitro.
[3H]penciclovir uptake probes the function of the sr39ttk
component of the trifusion reporter (22). We showed that
fumitremorgin C had a small inhibitory effect on radiotracer
uptake in 22Rv1/CMV-tri cells after either 1 or 3 h of incubation
with [3H]penciclovir (Supplementary Fig. S2 online). Confinement
of the signal enhancement effect of fumitremorgin C to the BLI
component of the trifusion reporter supports a mechanism that
is independent of the reporter and likely due to the ability of
D-luciferin to gain access to (intracellular) fLuc.
D-Luciferin is a specific ABCG2/BCRP substrate. We examined which of the ABC transporters were responsible for the
diminished cellular uptake of D-luciferin. Reverse transcription–
PCR was used to identify the ABC transporters expressed by 22Rv1
cells. Transcripts for multiple ABC transporters, including ABCB1/
Pgp, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and ABCG2/BCRP, were identified
(Supplementary Fig. S3 online). We examined the effects of ABC
transporter inhibitors on quantitative fLuc-mediated BLI in cell
lines engineered to stably express specific ABC transporters. Cells
engineered to express wild-type (wt) ABCG2/BCRP or mutant
ABCG2/BCRP transporters T10 (R482T) and G2 (R482G) were
transiently transfected with the CMV trifusion reporter and then
seeded into 24-well plates for imaging in the presence or absence of
transporter inhibitors (10). Mutation at amino acid 482 alters the
substrate specificity of ABCG2/BCRP dramatically. For example,
HEK-293 cells transfected with the mutant ABCG2/BCRP T10 were
71-fold less sensitive to the Pgp substrate doxorubicin but those
transfected with the wt transporter were only 3-fold less sensitive
(10). Fumitremorgin C enhanced the BLI signal 3-fold within cells
expressing transgenic wt ABCG2/BCRP within 10 min of adding
D-luciferin. Fumitremorgin C had no effect on control-transfected
cells that did not express the ABCG2/BCRP transgene (Fig. 3).
Verapamil and indomethacin, which most potently inhibit ABCB1/
Pgp and MRP (ABCC), respectively, generated only mild signal
enhancement in the ABCG2/BCRP overexpressing cells. Verapamil,
indomethacin, and fumitremorgin C only minimally enhanced BLI
in cells engineered to express the mutant ABCG2/BCRP transporters T10 and G2 (Fig. 3). In contrast to cells overexpressing wt
ABCG2/BCRP, fumitremorgin C had no effect on the BLI output in
cells overexpressing ABCB1/Pgp, MRP1, or MRP2. To show that the

respectively) of immunocompromised (nude) mice. A, a representative mouse

tumor before fumitremorgin C injection and then increased f4-fold after
fumitremorgin C injection to levels comparable to the control tumor. Data are
representative of results from four separate animals.

ABC transporters that were overexpressed were functional, we did
a calcein AM dye uptake assay (Supplementary Fig. S4 online;
ref. 23). Similarly, verapamil, indomethacin, and doxorubicin did
not alter light output in cells overexpressing these ABC transporters (Fig. 4; doxorubicin data not shown). These multiple, complementary findings show that D-luciferin is a specific substrate
for ABCG2/BCRP and suggest that pharmacologic transporter
inhibition enhances BLI by increasing the cytoplasmic concentrations of this luciferase substrate.
ABCG2/BCRP transporter activity alters D-luciferin–dependent BLI in vivo. We asked if modulating ABCG2/BCRP activity
alters D-luciferin–dependent BLI in vivo. Wt HEK-293 cells and
ABCG2/BCRP-overexpressing HEK-293 cells were initially transfected with the CMV-trifusion reporter plasmid expression vector
(Supplementary Fig. S5 online). Each cell line was then implanted
s.c. into opposite flanks of immunocompromised mice. One to four
days later, animals were imaged sequentially after the administration of D-luciferin before and after a single dose of fumitremorgin C
(25 mg/kg i.v.). Before fumitremorgin C administration, the BLI
signal emitted from the ABCG2/BCRP overexpressing xenografts
was significantly lower than that from wt xenografts. After
fumitremorgin C administration, the BLI signal from the ABCG2/

BCRP xenografts increased about 2-fold to 10-fold, compared
with the wt xenografts (n = 4). In the representative mouse shown
in Fig. 5, the signal from the ABCG2/BCRP-overexpressing tumor
(left flank) was only f30% of that from the wt control tumor
(right flank) before fumitremorgin C administration, and its signal
increased f4-fold after fumitremorgin C administration. The
control xenografts also showed a small increase in BLI signal after
fumitremorgin C administration, but the magnitude change (f30%
increase) was substantially lower than that observed in xenografts
engineered to express wt ABCG2/BCRP. We extended these
findings in the ABCG2/BCRP transgenic xenografts further by
testing if fumitremorgin C modulates the light output from 22Rv1
prostate carcinoma xenografts established in immunocompromised mice (Fig. 6). In these experiments, fumitremorgin C
(or vehicle control) was given to mice receiving a preestablished
continuous infusion of D-luciferin (24). Compared with vehicletreated mice (n = 4), fumitremorgin C induced f3-fold gradual
increase in BLI signal within 30 min after injection, and the
intensity of BLI was either maintained or increased further over the
next 30 min of imaging.

Discussion
We show in this report that the benzothiazoyl thiazole fLuc
substrate D-luciferin is also a substrate for the ABC transporter
ABCG2/BCRP and that ABCG2/BCRP activity influences BLI in
intact cells and tissues. We also show that ABCG2/BCRP inhibitors
can enhance BLI in ABCG2/BCRP-expressing target tissues in vivo.
These findings have important implications for in vivo molecular

and ABCG2/BCRP

BLI, which is rapidly becoming a standard method for measuring
gene expression changes in normal tissues, cancer, and specific cell
populations, such as stem cells, many of which express ABCG2/
BCRP (25, 26).
Our findings are consistent with those of Pichler et al. who
previously found that D-luciferin is not a substrate for ABCB1/Pgp
(7). However, they reported in that study that coelenterazine,
another important although less commonly used luciferase
substrate ( for rLuc), is a substrate for ABCB1/Pgp. But rLuc and
coelenterazine are not used for imaging in vivo due to low
quantum yield, instability of coelenterazine in plasma, and poor
tissue penetration of emitted photons (27, 28). fLuc is the standard
in vivo molecular imaging reporter, and an industry is rapidly
developing around its use with D-luciferin as a substrate. In fact,
D-luciferin is the nearly exclusive substrate for in vitro cell-based
assays using BLI as well.
Together, our findings and those of Pichler at al. indicate that
ABCB1/Pgp and ABCG2/BCRP activity must be considered when
luciferase imaging using coelenterazine or D-luciferin as substrates,
respectively, is applied to intact cells or tissues. Failure to do so
could result in inadvertently attributing relative differences in
bioluminescence output to differences in luciferase reporter
expression when differences in substrate transport might more
appropriately be implicated. Some unexpected results in the
literature may also be explained, in part, by the influence of
ABCG2/BCRP on BLI. For example, the difference in the kinetics of
photon emission from orthotopic compared with heterotopic brain
tumor xenografts may be due to the presence of ABCG2/BCRP at
the blood-brain barrier rather than low levels of fLuc expression in

Figure 6. The specific ABCG2/BCRP inhibitor
fumitremorgin C enhances BLI signal from 22Rv1 tumors
in vivo . 22Rv1 cells stably transfected with CMV-tri were
implanted s.c. into the right flank of mice and allowed to
form small tumors. Osmotic minipumps implanted s.c. into
the left side of the mice were used to deliver D-luciferin
continuously (25 Ag/h), and imaging was performed before
and after a single i.v. injection of fumitremorgin C or
vehicle. A, representative images of the same two mice,
before (left ) and 30 min after fumitremorgin C or vehicle
injection (right ). B, time course of quantitative BLI before
and after fumitremorgin C or vehicle injection. BLI signal
increased gradually by f2-fold after fumitremorgin C
administration in contrast to signal from the mouse treated
with vehicle, which remained relatively unchanged. Arrows
indicate fumitremorgin C and vehicle injection times.
Data are representative of results from four separate
animals.

target cells within the central nervous system, as suggested by
Burgos et al. (29, 30). Perhaps an even more salient example can be
found in Zhang et al. (31). In that study, a transgenic ( for fLuc)
reporter mouse model was established to study transcriptional
regulation of the human CYP3A4 gene by placing fLuc under the
control of the CYP3A4 promoter. fLuc-luciferin BLI was used to
compare relative levels of CYP3A4 expression in different organs
and organ-specific CYP3A4 induction by drugs. Based on our
findings and the fact that ABCG2/BCRP expression is not uniform
throughout the mouse but differs considerably between organs and
is gender dependent (32), the organ-specific expression based on
the reported BLI may be inaccurate. Seven CYP3A4 inducers were
then tested in this in vivo model, and the induction responses
based on BLI were reported. Several of the compounds tested,
including the compound that provided the greatest BLI output,
could be ABCG2/BCRP inhibitors or substrates. Many CYP3A4
inducers concurrently serve as modulators of MDR pumps (33, 34).
Specifically, one of the active compounds in the paper, nifedipine, is
an ABCG2/BCRP inhibitor (35).
Because ABCG2/BCRP is widely expressed and its known
substrates are structurally diverse, ABCG2/BCRP has become an
important target for pharmacologic manipulation in efforts to
overcome drug resistance in anticancer therapy and to enhance
delivery of agents to the central nervous system (30, 36–39). The
emerging importance of this relatively recently described ABC
transporter is likely to intensify efforts to develop new, nontoxic
inhibitors with therapeutic potential, in some cases via the
application of high-throughput screens (40). That D-luciferin is a
substrate for ABCG2/BCRP could facilitate the screening for new
ABCG2/BCRP inhibitors. For example, BLI ‘‘reporter mice’’ have
been generated and could provide an organ-specific, in vivo

readout of ABCG2/BCRP modulation by various compounds (41). A
high-throughput cellular assay for compounds that modulate
ABCG2/BCRP can be readily developed based on BLI techniques
similar to those used by us in this report. A BLI-based drug
screening method would have distinct advantages over current
fluorescent assays. Our findings also predict that BLI with fLuc
could be applied to screen rapidly for ABCG2/BCRP functional
mutations. Whereas D-luciferin proved to be a substrate of wt
ABCG2/BCRP, single amino acid changes (R482T and R482G)
within the transporter change the BLI output enhancement in
response to various inhibitors. This suggests that BLI could provide
a very sensitive readout on minor, i.e., single amino acid, changes
that alter transporter function.
In summary, we have shown that D-luciferin is a substrate for
ABCG2/BCRP and that changes in the activity of this transporter
can substantially alter cell-based or in vivo BLI end points
independent of other physiologic processes or molecular pathways
specifically under investigation. Thus, ABCG2/BCRP expression
and function must be considered in studies that rely on BLI with Dluciferin as a substrate in intact cells or tissues. Our findings also
establish the feasibility of developing BLI-based high-throughput
screens to identify novel modulators of ABCG2/BCRP for future
testing in cancer and other disorders.
