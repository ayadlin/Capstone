Abstract
Mutated KRAS (KRAS ) is a fundamental driver in the majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Using an
inducible mouse model of KRAS -driven PDAC, we compared
KRAS genetic extinction with pharmacologic inhibition of
MEK1 in tumor spheres and in vivo. KRAS ablation blocked
proliferation and induced apoptosis, whereas MEK1 inhibition
exerted cytostatic effects. Proteomic analysis evidenced that
MEK1 inhibition was accompanied by a sustained activation
of the PI3K–AKT–MTOR pathway and by the activation of AXL,
PDGFRa, and HER1–2 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
expressed in a large proportion of human PDAC samples
analyzed. Although single inhibition of each RTK alone or plus
MEK1 inhibitors was ineffective, a combination of inhibitors
targeting all three coactivated RTKs and MEK1 was needed to

inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in both mouse and
human low-passage PDAC cultures. Importantly, constitutive
AKT activation, which may mimic the fraction of AKT2-ampliﬁed PDAC, was able to bypass the induction of apoptosis
caused by KRAS ablation, highlighting a potential inherent
resistance mechanism that may inform the clinical application
of MEK inhibitor therapy. This study suggests that combinatorial-targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer must be informed
by the activation state of each putative driver in a given
treatment context. In addition, our work may offer explanative
and predictive power in understanding why inhibitors of EGFR
signaling fail in PDAC treatment and how drug resistance
mechanisms may arise in strategies to directly target KRAS.

survive more than 5 years (1). Only a small fraction of cases
present with local disease and are eligible for potentially curative
surgical resection; whereas, the remaining patients possess locally
advanced or metastatic disease and receive systemic and palliative
therapies. The treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PDAC
with gemcitabine and radiation provides modest survival beneﬁt,
and recent clinical trials show further marginal improvement with
combination of 5-ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or with nab-paclitaxel (2,3).
Oncogenic mutation of KRAS is a signature molecular event in
PDAC and functions as a key driver of disease initiation and
maintenance in approximately 90% of cases (4). Targeting oncogenic KRAS represents an ideal therapeutic strategy, although
attempts to target KRAS directly have thus far failed, whereas
farnesyltransferase inhibitors have shown no clinical beneﬁt (5).
Indeed targeting KRAS (or other structurally related family members) remains one of the biggest challenges in oncology (5) and
has inspired a large scale NCI-directed effort (6,7). Inhibition of
KRAS downstream effectors might in principle achieve similar
results, and attempts have been made to target the MAPK signaling
cascade and the PI3K–AKT–MTOR signaling pathway in multiple
cancer subtypes. Combinatorial inhibition of these two critical
effector pathways has resulted in favorable therapeutic outcomes
in multiple preclinical studies in mutant RAS-driven tumor

models (8,9); however, recent clinical data showed that these
combination therapies are associated with toxicities that might
ultimately limit the feasibility of this approach (10). A multitude
of alternative targeted therapy regimens have been clinically tested
for the treatment of PDAC and, apart from the statistically
signiﬁcant albeit minimal effects seen with EGFR inhibitors, none
has provided a clear clinical beneﬁts (11). Moreover, despite the
frequent overexpression of EGFR in KRAS-driven PDAC and the
essentiality of EGFR for tumor establishment (12), the therapeutic
beneﬁts of EGFR inhibition alone or in combination with gemcitabine remain very modest (13).
Here, we use a conditional genetically engineered mouse model
(GEMM) of PDAC engineered with pancreas-speciﬁc inducible
mutant KRAS (KRASG12D) allele to evaluate signaling pathway
patterns emerging with either genetic abrogation of KRASG12D or
pharmacologic inhibition of MEK1 in vivo or in vitro. As 2D-cultured
cancer cell lines are poorly predictive of in vivo responses to pharmacologic inhibition (14), we use a 3D culture system of primary
tumor-derived spheres as well as in in vivo tumor testing. We show
that MEK1 inhibition activates a network of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) that may limit the efﬁcacy of single anti–RTK-based
therapies alone or in combination with MEK1 inhibitors. Furthermore, activation of AXL, which is highly expressed in our inducible
KRASG12D GEMM as well as in a signiﬁcant number of clinical PDAC
samples, might limit the beneﬁts of MEK1–EGFR inhibitor combination treatments currently undergoing clinical testing.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
iKRAS cells were derived from P48 CRE_TetO-LSL-KRAS
G12D_Rosa-rtTA_p53ﬂ/þ, tumor-bearing mice (15). Tumors were
minced and digested in collagenase IV and dispase (4 mg/mL) for
1 hour at 37 C on an orbital shaker and subsequently ﬁltered
through a 40 mmol/L nylon cell strainer. For conventional tissue
culture, cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with
10% FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
For 3D tissue culture, cells were maintained in low-attachment
plates in stem cell medium (MEBM; Lonza) supplemented with 2
mmol/L glutamine (Invitrogen), B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL
hEGF (PeproTech), 20 ng/mL hFGF (PeproTech), 5 mg/mL hInsulin (Roche), 0.5 mmol/L hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 100
mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 mg/mL heparin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Methocult M3134 (STEMCELL Technologies)
was added to stem cell medium (ﬁnal concentration 0.8%) to
keep tumor cells growing as clonal spheres (16). MIA PaCa-2 and
Panc1 cells were obtained from the ATCC.
Cell viability
To determine viability of cells grown in 3D conditions, cells
embedded in methylcellulose-based semisolid media were
exposed to 1 mmol/L calcein (Life Technologies), incubated for
30 minutes, and quantiﬁed through ImageXpress velos (Molecular Devices) apparatus. Alternatively, cells were collected through
centrifugation, trypsinized, stained in 1X Annexin V buffer with
Annexin V–phycoerythrin and 7AAD (BD Biosciences) for 5
minutes at room temperature and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Animal studies
Animal studies were conducted according to IACUC guidelines.
For allograft and xenograft establishment, 5  104 iKRAS cells or

2  106 PATC cells were suspended in 200 mL of 50% HBSS, 50%
growth factor reduced Matrigel and injected s.c. in the right ﬂank of
nude mice. Tumor volume was assessed using caliper measurements and calculated according to the standard formula: length/2
 width2. AZD6244, BEZ235, lapatinib, and imatinib were administered through oral gavage, whereas AXLi was administered by i.p.
injection. The drugs were dissolved in the following vehicles:
(i) AZD6244 and lapatinib, 10% methylcellulose, 2% tween 20;
(ii) BEZ235, 50% 2 methylpyrrolidone, 50% PEG300; (iii) imatinib, sterile PBS; and (iv) AXLi, 10% DMSO, 90% PEG300.
Reverse phase protein array
The reverse phase protein array (RPPA) protein expression
proﬁles were generated by the MD Anderson RPPA core facility
following standard protocols (17). More information can be
found at http://www.mdanderson.org/education-and-research/
resources-for-professionals/scientiﬁc-resources/core-facilitiesand-services/functional-proteomics-rppa-core/index.html. The
RPPA dilution curves were ﬁtted with a logistic model from the
SuperCurve R-package (18,19), and RPPA data were normalized
by protein loading. Normalized log2-transformed data were used
for further statistical analyses. Differential expression between
two conditions was calculated using the Student t test and multiple conditions with one-way ANOVA with custom R-scripts. Raw
P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the
Benjamini–Hochberg correction (FDR), and protein changes were
considered signiﬁcant when FDR was less than 10%.
Western blot analysis
Whole-cell extracts were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer
apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).
After incubation with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (10 mmol/L Tris,
pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 60 minutes,
the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (see
Supplementary Material for detailed antibodies list) at 4 C overnight. Membranes were washed three times for 10 minutes and
incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were washed with
TBST three times and developed after ECL-based chemiluminescence reaction through ﬁlm exposure.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed tumors were dehydrated and parafﬁn-embedded according to standard procedures. Slices (5 mm) were cut
using a microtome, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen unmasking by heating at 95 C for 30 minutes with a commercially
available antigen unmasking solution (Citra Plus—Biogenex).
Slices were subsequently incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide
for 15 minutes, incubated with primary antibodies, washed,
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed,
and developed through DAB incubation. Slices were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.
Real-time PCR
cDNAs were synthesized from RNA through reverse transcription with a commercially available kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed by
a TAQMAN-based reaction by using the following sets of Invitrogen primers and probes: growth arrest–speciﬁc 6 (GAS6; mmol/L
00490378_m1), PDGFA (mmol/L 01205760_m1), PDGFB

Relative mRNA quantities were calculated using the comparative
DDCt method.
Lentivirus production
A semiconﬂuent 15-cm plate of HEK293T was transfected
with 30 mg of pHAGE plasmid and a mixture of the packaging–encoding vectors PMD2.G (9 mg) and pCMVDR-8.74
(19.5 mg). Virus-containing media were collected 72 hours posttransfection and ﬁltered; the virus was concentrated through
ultracentrifugation.

Results
Pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK signaling provides limited
antitumor impact relative to genetic extinction of KRASG12D
To evaluate changes in cell signaling upon genetic ablation of
KRASG12D, we derived tumor cell lines from our previously
characterized GEMM model harboring an inducible KRASG12D
allele (P48 CRE_TetO-LSL-KRAS G12D_Rosa-rtTA_ p53ﬂ/þ, hereafter referred to as iKRAS cells; ref. 15). In this system, a doxycycline-inducible promoter controls the expression of the constitutively active KRASG12D allele such that addition or removal
of doxycycline induces or represses gene expression, respectively,
with the consequent induction and subsequent regression of very
aggressive established tumors. In addition, cells isolated from
explanted tumors readily reformed tumors upon transplantation
in recipient mice in the presence of doxycycline. As previously
described (15), genetic extinction of KRASG12D upon doxycycline removal resulted in rapid tumor regression that was accompanied by dramatic induction of apoptosis and arrest of cell
proliferation, demonstrating that KRASG12D is required for
tumor maintenance (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). In
contrast, extinction of KRASG12D upon doxycyline withdrawal
in iKRAS cells maintained in standard 2D culture conditions did
not exhibit antiproliferative or apoptotic phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. S2). The poor correlation of 2D models with the
in vivo setting prompted the development of a 3D culture model
in which iKRAS cells clonally proliferate and form tumor spheres
only in the presence of doxycycline, and removal of doxycycline
precipitates robust proliferative arrest and apoptosis as observed
in vivo (Fig. 1C and D). We speculated that this 3D culture system
may better predict antitumor responses to various drug
treatments.
As KRASG12D is undruggable, signiﬁcant effort has focused on
dampening its signaling cascade. To determine which pharmacologic treatment(s) most closely recapitulate the signaling events
and the phenotypic consequences of KRASG12D ablation observed
in our iKRAS model, we treated iKRAS cells kept in the presence
of doxycycline with the MEK1 inhibitor AZD6244 at a dose (2
mmol/L) capable of inhibiting ERK phosphorylation to an extent
comparable with what is observed upon 48 hours of doxycycline
withdrawal (Fig. 1A). Although AZD6244 treatment signiﬁcantly
inhibited cell proliferation, there was a notable lack of cell death
(Fig. 1C and D). To conduct parallel in vivo studies, mice carrying
iKRAS-derived subcutaneous allograft were divided into three
groups: continued doxycycline administration, doxycycline withdrawal, or continued doxycycline administration plus AZD6244
at 100 mg/kg/d, a dose that achieves the highest pharmacologic
pathway repression. Similar to the 3D model, we observed complete tumor regression upon doxycycline withdrawal, but only

blunted tumor growth with AZD6244 treatment (Fig. 1E). Correspondingly, immunohistochemical analysis of tumors following doxycycline withdrawal conﬁrmed robust inhibition of
cell proliferation (Ki67) and induction of apoptosis (cleaved
caspase-3) compared with reduced cell proliferation and no
apoptosis with AZD6244 treatment. Of note, inhibition of ERK
phosphorylation was similar in AZD6244-treated and KRASablated tumors (Fig. 1F).
KRASG12D ablation results in coextinction of MAPK and
PI3K–AKT–MTOR signaling, whereas MEK inhibition results
in extinction of MAPK signaling with concomitant activation
of AKT
We next audited signaling pathways to potentially identify
differentially regulated signaling events that may underlie the
distinct biologic phenotypes of KRASG12D extinction versus
AZD6244 treatment. To that end, we performed an RPPA analysis
of lysates derived from three independent iKRAS lines cultured in
the presence of doxycyline, after doxycycline withdrawal, or
doxycycline plus AZD6244 treatment (2 mmol/L). The heatmap
(Fig. 2A) reveals that multiple effectors of the PI3K–AKT–MTOR
signaling pathway showed differential regulation in the setting of
KRASG12D extinction versus MEK inhibition. Speciﬁcally,
KRASG12D extinction showed dramatic repression of PI3K–
AKT–MTOR targets: phospho-PRAS40, phospho-GSK alpha/beta,
and phospho MTOR relative to KRASG12D–expressing cells,
whereas MEK inhibition resulted in a partial attenuation of these
signaling components. Conversely, KRASG12D ablation or MEK
inhibitor treatment induced robust and minor accumulations of
FOXO3a, respectively. Notably, ERK phosphorylation on Thr202
and Tyr204 and RAS–MAPK-regulated phosphorylation of
ribosomal protein S6 on Ser235 and Ser236 (20) were similarly inhibited by KRASG12D ablation or MEK inhibitor treatment. Immunohistochemistry analysis conﬁrmed comparable
signaling changes in treated tumors (Fig. 2B). Moreover, Western blot analysis of iKRAS cells cultured with doxycyline, after
doxycycline withdrawal, or doxycycline plus AZD6244 treatment
(2 mmol/L) evidenced a robust increment in phospho-AKT
at Thr308 and Ser473 in AZD6244-treated samples whereas
KRASG12D ablation caused a time-dependent reduction of phospho
AKT levels (Fig. 2C).
To assess whether the differential PI3K–AKT–MTOR activation
status observed upon KRASG12D ablation versus MEK inhibition
may be responsible for the different tumor response, we established iKRAS-derived allografts and treated them with AZD6244
(100 mg/kg/d) and/or BEZ235 (40 mg/kg/d; a dual PI3K-MTOR
inhibitor). Inhibition of the MAPK signaling arm or PI3K–AKT–
MTOR arms alone provided minimal antitumor beneﬁt, whereas
concurrent inhibition of both effector pathways exerted robust
antitumor efﬁcacy mimicking the phenotypic changes observed
upon KRASG12D ablation (Fig. 2D).
Both KRASG12D ablation and MEK inhibition activate EGFR,
HER2, PDGFRa, and AXL
It has been shown that MEK inhibition results in hyperactivation of the erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog
(ERBB) RTKs (21), which could explain the increase in
AKT phosphorylation observed upon MEK1 inhibitor treatment. Phospho-RTK analyses performed on resected iKRASderived tumors showed detectable basal levels of phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRa)

in KRASG12D-expressing tumors, as well as a robust increase in
phosphorylation of EGFR, human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2), and P-AXL upon either AZD6244 treatment
or doxycycline withdrawal (Fig. 3A). To determine whether
increased RTK activation resulted from increased expression of
the RTKs or their ligands, we analyzed protein lysates and cDNA
from iKRAS cells. We found that RTK activation was the result
of both, as KRAS ablation increased expression of PDGFRa and
AXL, as well as the PDGFR ligands PDGFa, PDGFb, PDGFc, and
the AXL ligand GAS6 (Fig. 3B and C and Supplementary Fig.
S4). In contrast, none of the EGFR family ligands assessed
showed an increased expression (data not shown).

1094 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

Diverse mechanisms may be responsible for the RTK activation observed in response to MEK inhibition. In particular, it has
been shown that AZD6244 treatment inhibits an MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 that prevents receptor
dimerization and activation (21), whereas a more broad transcriptional RTK activation occurs due to inhibition of c-myc
(22). Because AXL levels were elevated upon KRASG12D ablation, we postulated that c-myc may negatively regulate AXL
expression. As expected, both ablation of KRASG12D and MEK
inhibitor treatment repressed c-myc expression, and knockdown
of c-myc in iKRAS lines resulted in increased AXL expression
(Fig. 3D and E).

RTKs drive redundant signaling to the PI3K–AKT–MTOR
pathway
To assess the effect on signaling modulation of each RTK
activated upon MEK inhibition, we performed RPPA analysis on
iKRAS cells exposed to single RTK inhibitors as well as their
different combinations with or without AZD6244 treatment. To
inhibit each RTK, we used the dual EGFR–HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, the PDGFRa inhibitor imatinib, and the novel AXL inhibitor
CH5451098 (hereafter referred to as AXLi; ref. 23). AXLi showed
superior selectivity and potency over other available AXL inhibitors, and we extensively evaluated its in vivo safety and pharmacokinetics (Supplementary Figs. S6, S7, and S8). RPPA proﬁles
(Fig. 4A) from single or combined RTK inhibitor–treated iKRAS
cells showed no signiﬁcant impact on protein or phosphoprotein
abundance of members of the PI3K–AKT–MTOR signaling pathway compared with untreated controls. This is consistent with our
observations that in basal, untreated conditions, iKRAS cells show
minimal RTK activation and support the view that the inhibitors
used in the present study are "on target" and are delivered at
appropriate doses to extinguish MEK inhibitor–mediated RTK

www.aacrjournals.org

activation (Supplementary Fig. S9). Moreover, no off-pathway
effects were detected in cells lacking RTK activation. In contrast,
combined treatment with RTK inhibitors and AZD6244 showed a
signiﬁcant impact on proteins and phosphoproteins of the PI3K–
AKT–MTOR signaling pathway only when AZD6244 was combined with all three RTK inhibitors, which produced pathway
inhibition analogous to that observed upon KRASG12D ablation.
To conﬁrm our results in vivo, we evaluated the levels of phosphoS6 kinase as a marker of the activity of the PI3K–AKT–MTOR
pathway in tumors treated with AXLi (30 mg/kg/d), imatinib
(100 mg/kg/d), or lapatinib (100 mg/kg/d) alone or in combination with AZD6244 (100 mg/kg/d) for 5 days. Consistent with the
RPPA data, neither treatment with a single RTK inhibitor nor
with combined single RTK and MEK inhibitors affected P-S6
levels (Fig. 4B), thus conﬁrming our earlier conclusion that
diverse RTKs drive redundant inputs to the PI3K–AKT–MTOR
signaling pathway. Ultimately, an analysis of AKT phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig. 4C and D) further validated
our ﬁndings that single RTK inhibition does not affect the
MEK1-mediated feedback loop of activation of the PI3K

signaling pathway and, conversely, this feedback is abrogated
only when coextinction of multiple RTKs is enabled.
Inhibition of multiple RTKs is required to synergize with MEK
inhibition and to induce antitumor activity
Because each RTK independently sustains the activity of the
PI3K–AKT–MTOR signaling pathway, we sought to evaluate the
therapeutic potential of anti-RTK therapy alone or in combination
with MEK inhibition. In vitro treatment of iKRAS cells evidenced
that none of the RTK inhibitors alone or in combination significantly inhibited growth of iKRAS tumor spheres (Fig. 5A), suggesting that KRASG12D-driven tumors may not require RTK signaling for their growth and survival. Moreover, concomitant
treatment of iKRAS cells with AZD6244 and any single RTK
inhibitor did not potentiate the activity of AZD6244. Conversely,
a robust inhibitory effect was observed when AZD6244 was
combined with lapatinib and AXLi, imatinib and AXLi, or even
more effectively when AZD6244 was combined with all three
RTK inhibitors concurrently (Fig. 5A). To validate these ﬁndings
in vivo, we treated iKRAS tumor-bearing mice with combinations
of AXLi (30 mg/kg/d), imatinib (100 mg/kg/d) or lapatinib (100
mg/kg/d), and AZD6244 (100 mg/kg/d). These experiments
conﬁrmed our in vitro ﬁndings that coextinction of MEK and of

1096 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

the RTKs activated by MEK inhibition was required to achieve
substantial tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 5B).
To address the human relevance of our ﬁndings, we treated
xenografts derived from a human primary PDAC-harboring
mutant KRAS (hereafter named PATC) with vehicle or AZD6244
(100 mg/kg/d) for 5 days and proﬁled RTK activation status in
tumor-derived lysates. MEK inhibition induced a modest increase
in P-AXL levels compared with vehicle-treated tumors, and a
robust increase of EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). We then
treated cells with lapatinib, AXLi, or their combination alone or
in addition to AZD6244 2 mmol/L to determine whether coextinction of multiple RTKs is necessary to induce anti-spherogenic
responses. Consistent with previous ﬁndings in our murine model
of PDAC, only coinhibition of AXL and EGFR along with MEK
inhibitor treatment signiﬁcantly repressed the spherogenic activity of PATC cells (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that inhibiting the
RTKs whose activation is induced by MEK inhibition may be
required for the development of an MEK inhibitor treatment
regimen.
There have been several reports of RTK overexpression in
human PDAC tissues (12,24–26), prompting analysis of EGFR,
AXL, and PDGFRa levels in a tissue microarray (TMA) containing
136 untreated PDAC cases. All three RTKs were moderately or

strong for AXL and 47.8% moderate and 23.3% strong for
PDGFRa; Fig. 5F), supporting the possibility that a relevant
fraction of PDAC tumors basally express determinants of resistance to MEK1 inhibition.
Constitutive AKT activation prevents tumor regression upon
KRASG12D ablation
Our data demonstrate that a number of RTKs are upregulated
upon MEK inhibition, and that each is able to sustain PI3K–
AKT–MTOR activation. To determine whether constitutive activation of PI3K–AKT–MTOR signaling can rescue KRASG12D
dependence, we derived allografts from iKRAS cells transduced
with either GFP or a constitutively active myristylated AKT
(myr-AKT; Fig. 6A). Both GFP- and myr-AKT–expressing iKRAS
cells formed tumors with analogous kinetics, indicating that
AKT hyperactivation does not provide an additional growth
advantage. However, upon doxycycline withdrawal, GFP-transduced tumors underwent rapid and robust regression, whereas
AKT-transduced tumors showed arrested growth but no significant reduction in tumor volume (Fig. 6C). Immunohistochemical analysis of the phosphorylation status of S6 and eIF4Ebinding protein 1 (4EBP1) in tumors upon KRASG12D ablation
conﬁrmed the maintenance of pathway activity in myr-AKT–
expressing tumors (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate that AKT

www.aacrjournals.org

activation, although unable to overcome dependency on
mutated KRAS for tumor growth, is sufﬁcient to promote tumor
maintenance, thereby facilitating eventual escape mechanisms.
Our data further support the conclusion that the limited
antitumor activity observed upon MAPK inhibition is likely
caused by MEK inhibition–mediated AKT activation.
Ten to 20% of PDAC tumors carry gain/ampliﬁcation of AKT2
(27,28), and we hypothesized that this subset of tumors may be
insensitive to KRASG12D ablation. To test this hypothesis, we used
MIA PaCa-2 and PANC1 cells, which both harbor mutant KRAS,
but only the latter has ampliﬁcation of 19q13 encompassing the
AKT2 locus (29). Both cell lines were transduced with an inducible
anti-KRAS shRNA to allow KRAS ablation, and MEK was inhibited
with 2 mmol/L AZD6244. In MIA PaCa-2 cells, KRAS knockdown
did not increase phospho-AKT levels above the low basal levels
observed, in contrast with a marked accumulation of phosphoAKT upon MEK inhibition (analogous to what we previously
observed in our murine model; Fig. 6D). Conversely, PANC1 cells
presented with basally elevated levels of total AKT and phosphoAKT, neither of which was further increased upon either KRAS
knockdown or MEK inhibition, suggesting that, in this cell line,
AKT2 ampliﬁcation drives constitutive activity of the pathway.
KRAS knockdown induced apoptosis only in the MIA PaCa-2 cell
line (Fig. 6E), supporting the contention that tumors harboring
AKT2 ampliﬁcation are intrinsically independent from mutant
KRAS for maintenance.

Discussion
In contrast with other driver oncogenes such as mutated BRAF
or EGFR, effective therapies that directly target mutated KRAS are
still unavailable; therefore, attempts to affect KRAS-driven tumors
largely depend on an improved understanding of the key effector
pathways required for tumor maintenance downstream of KRAS.
Unfortunately, clinical studies have shown that abrogation of the
MAPK effector pathway alone through MEK inhibitors in KRASdriven tumors fails to achieve clinical responses (30,31). Accordingly, we failed to see a robust therapeutic response upon MEK
inhibition in our murine model of PDAC, whereas ablation of
KRASG12D resulted in visibly complete tumor regression, thus
underscoring the utility of this model to deeply characterize KRAS
effectors. Through comparative analyses of genetic KRASG12D
ablation versus MEK inhibition, we identiﬁed differentially regulated key effectors. Speciﬁcally, in agreement with previous
reports (32,33), the sole inhibition of MEK1 promoted the
activation of the PI3K pathway whereas KRAS ablation profoundly inhibited both PI3K–AKT–MTOR and MAPK signaling, further
emphasizing the need to simultaneously inhibit both pathways to
yield a robust antitumor response such as was observed upon
KRAS ablation in our iKRAS murine model. Despite numerous
previous reports of promising therapeutic efﬁcacy from various
combinations of inhibitors of these two pathways (8,9,34), an
emerging set of clinical data have shown that these combinations
are poorly tolerated, thus limiting their utility (10).
It has been established in multiple tumor models that MEK
inhibition engages feedback loops that promote hyperactivation
of the PI3K–AKT–MTOR pathway through the recruitment of

1098 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

diverse RTKs, including AXL and PDGFRa (21,22,35). Diverse
feedback circuits have been described, including the MTORC1mediated recruitment of insulin receptor kinase (36,37) and the
MEK inhibition–mediated hyperactivation of the ERBB receptors
EGFR, HER2, and ERBB3 (21,38). Moreover MEK inhibition–
mediated RTK activation was observed in both RAS-mutant and
RAS-wt tumor models, indicating that such adaptive response is
not unique to mutant RAS-driven tumors (21,22,35). Both of
these RTK-mediated feedback loops activate the PI3K pathway,
and thereby represent valuable "druggable" therapeutic opportunities that may afford lower toxicity than MEK–PI3K inhibitor
combinations. However, although a variety of preclinical studies
in diverse tumor models have reported promising antitumor
activity by cotargeting of MEK and ERBB receptors (39–41), a
recent clinical study of combined therapy with AZD6244 and the
anti-EGFR drug erlotinib in patients with chemotherapy-refractory pancreatic cancer reported that antitumor activity was only
achieved in a subset of patients (42).
We proﬁled RTK activation and therapeutic responses to targeting the RTK-mediated feedback loops in our murine model.
Surprisingly, we observed that RTK activation occurs both upon
KRASG12D ablation and MEK inhibition, although in the former
this event fails to induce AKT hyperactivation or to promote
tumor maintenance, suggesting that continuous KRASG12D signaling is required to promote RTK-mediated activation of the
PI3K pathway. Importantly, the RTK activation we observed
included not only HER1–2, but also the TAM receptor AXL as
well as PDGFRa. Moreover, the mechanism of activation of AXL
and PDGFRa involves both upregulation of the RTK itself as well

as transcriptional upregulation of their ligands, suggesting that,
upon MEK inhibition, tumor cells possess the ability to engage
autonomous regulatory circuits rather than relying solely on the
supply of growth factors from the microenvironment.
To evaluate the contribution of each RTK activated upon
MEK inhibitor treatment, we tested whether inhibition of any
one RTK exerted dominant control over prosurvival pathway
activation, which may help elucidate strategies for targeted
therapy combinations. These efforts included extensive characterization of a novel AXL inhibitor with unprecedented
selectivity and potency compared with all others previously
described. We showed that inhibition of any single RTK activated by MEK inhibitor treatment did not yield antitumor
efﬁcacy above that achieved with the MEK inhibitor alone.
Rather, concomitant inhibition of all of the diverse RTKs
activated upon MEK inhibition was required to yield synergistic
effects with MEK inhibition in both our iKRAS murine model,
as well as in an MEK inhibitor–treated model derived from
human primary PDAC. This result has profound clinical relevance, as it underscores the need for personalized therapy
combinations based on a rational coextinction strategy versus
blind enrollment into trials that combine an MEK inhibitor
with a single RTK inhibitor. Moreover, consistent with previous
reports, we found detectable AXL and PDGFRa expression in a
number of human PDAC samples (24–26), suggesting that
many patients present with tumors that may be easily resistant
to MEK–HER inhibitor combinations. Furthermore, our data
are in line with previous evidence that activation of AXL and
PDGFRa can drive resistance to anti-EGFR treatment (43,44)
and, in the case of AXL, to anti-MEK1 therapy (45,46). Prote-

omic proﬁling of iKRAS cells upon MEK inhibition and treatment with single or multiple RTK inhibitors showed that each
RTK can independently sustain hyperactivity of the PI3K pathway mediated by MEK inhibition.
Given the striking dominance of the PI3K signaling pathway
activation in tumor maintenance, we asked whether a fraction of
PDAC-harboring genomic aberrations driving constitutive activation of this pathway such as AKT2 ampliﬁcation, which occurs
in 10% to 20% of PDACs (27,28), may render this subset of
patients insensitive not only to MEK–RTK inhibitors, but also to
continuous KRAS signaling. Indeed, constitutive activation of the
PI3K–AKT pathway prevented tumor regression upon KRAS ablation and, furthermore, cell lines harboring AKT2 ampliﬁcation
manifested resistance not only to MEK inhibition, but also to
genetic abrogation of KRAS.
Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that combinatorial MEK–
RTK-targeted therapies may have limited impact without careful
patients stratiﬁcation to therapy combinations based on an individual's oncogenome and on the activation state of signal transduction pathways at time of treatment. On the basis of this, a
personalized therapy strategy that accounts for the genomic
aberrations driving constitutive activity of the PI3K signaling
pathway, as well as a deep analysis of feedback circuits engaged
by MEK inhibition, is more likely to result in positive clinical
outcomes than random assignment to combination therapies to
inhibit MEK and a single RTK. An improved and comprehensive
understanding of these and additional mechanisms that allow
survival of tumors cells despite suppression of mutant KRASmediated signaling (16,47) will deﬁne possibly deﬁnitive therapeutic strategies.
