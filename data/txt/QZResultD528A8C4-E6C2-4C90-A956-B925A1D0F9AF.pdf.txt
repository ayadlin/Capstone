Abstract
Lipogenesis inhibition was reported to induce apoptosis and repress proliferation
of cancer cells while barely affecting normal cells. Lipins exhibit dual function as
enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and
as co-transcriptional regulators. Thus, they are able to regulate lipid homeostasis at
several nodal points. Here, we show that lipin-1 is up-regulated in several cancer cell
lines and overexpressed in 50 % of high grade prostate cancers. The proliferation
of prostate and breast cancer cells, but not of non-tumorigenic cells, was repressed
upon lipin-1 knock-down. Lipin-1 depletion also decreased cancer cell migration
through RhoA activation. Lipin-1 silencing did not significantly affect global lipid
synthesis but enhanced the cellular concentration of phosphatidic acid. In parallel,
autophagy was induced while AKT and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation were
repressed. We also observed a compensatory regulation between lipin-1 and lipin-2
and demonstrated that their co-silencing aggravates the phenotype induced by
lipin-1 silencing alone. Most interestingly, lipin-1 depletion or lipins inhibition with
propranolol sensitized cancer cells to rapamycin. These data indicate that lipin-1
controls main cellular processes involved in cancer progression and that its targeting,
alone or in combination with other treatments, could open new avenues in anticancer
therapy.

Introduction

crucial processes necessary for cell transformation such
as migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis [2].
Finally, lipids are also required for protein modifications
that critically regulate their functions and are involved
in protein and organelle turnover through autophagy
regulation [2]. Thus, the various roles of lipids make
them essential components of the cellular machinery
regulating the phenotype of cancer cells. Since the pivotal
observation that Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) is a potential
target for anticancer therapy [3], much effort has been
devoted to targeting key enzymes of lipid biosynthesis.
Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by pharmacological tools
or targeting key enzymes with siRNA results in inhibition
of cancer cell proliferation or cell death [4-7].
Although lipid homeostasis deregulation is observed

Alterations of various metabolic pathways are
frequently noticed in cancer cells. Among them, the most
documented is increased glucose consumption through
aerobic glycolysis known as the “Warburg effect”.
However, other metabolic processes, such as protein,
nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis, are also deregulated in
cancer cells [1]. This metabolic reprogramming is needed
to meet the increased requirements of highly proliferating
cancer cells for energy and building blocks. In the case of
lipids, their increased biosynthetic rate provides material
required for cell membranes formation and energy storage.
In addition, lipids play also significant roles as signaling
molecules. The alteration of their abundance can affect

in many different cancer types, it is especially critical in
prostate cancer where the classical “glycolysis-switch”
is not observed [8]. Targeting key enzymes of lipid
biosynthesis appears therefore as a promising approach
to fight prostate cancer [9]. However, numerous enzymes
are involved in lipid biosynthesis and the specific role of
many of them during cancer progression is still unknown
[10]. This is the case for lipin-1, one of the three members
of the lipins family. Lipin-1 is involved in the regulation of
triglyceride and phospholipid biosynthesis by catalyzing
the dephosphorylation of phosphatidate into diacylglycerol
(DAG) [11]. It acts also as a co-regulator of transcription
and, as such, can up-regulate fatty acids uptake and
oxidation, TCA cycle and mitochondrial metabolism
genes. Thus, due to its dual function as enzyme and cotranscriptional regulator, lipin-1 is able to regulate lipid
homeostasis at several nodal points [12]. Very recently,
it was also described as being involved in the late phase
of autophagy [13], a key cellular function contributing to
cancer progression in a context-dependent manner [14].
Here, we show that lipin-1expression is increased
in various cancer cell types both in vitro and in vivo in

human prostate tumor samples. The specific inhibition of
lipin-1 in prostate and breast cancer cells demonstrates
its critical importance for cell proliferation and migration
through deregulation of several intracellular signaling
pathways. This study demonstrates for the first time that
the targeting of lipin-1 is a potential new anti-cancer
strategy that could be used alone or in combination with
drugs like rapamycin.

Results
Expression of lipin-1 in cancer	
We previously identified lipin-1 by microarray as
a Rac1-regulated gene in the prostate adenocarcinoma
cell line PC-3 (personal observation). This regulation
was validated here at the protein level by silencing Rac1
with two different siRNA that resulted in lipin-1 downregulation (Fig.1A). RT-qPCR measurements indicate that
Rac1 silencing significantly decreased (δδCt of -0.9) the

Fig.1: Lipin-1 expression is increased in various cancer cell lines and in prostate cancer samples. (A) Lipin-1 is positively
regulated by Rac1. 48 h after transfection with two different siRNA targeting Rac1 (siRac1(1) and siRac1(2)), with a control siRNA (Scr)
or without sirna (mock) PC-3 cells were lysed and analysed by immuno-blotting with specific antibodies to lipin-1, Rac1 and Erk1/2. (B)
Lipin-1 is highly expressed in various cancer cell lines as compared to fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Fibroblasts (FIBRO), endothelial
cells (LT2), A2058, Hs578T, MCF7 and HT1080 cells were lysed and analysed by immuno-blotting with specific antibodies to lipin-1 and
Erk1,2. (C) Lipin-1 is highly expressed in the most aggressive prostatic cancer cell lines. PNT1A, LnCaP, C4-2B and PC-3 cells were lysed
and analyzed by immuno-blotting with specific antibodies to lipin-1 and Erk1,2. (D) Representative images of sections of normal human
prostate (up) and of high grade prostate adenocarcinoma positive for anti-lipin-1 labelling (down) are shown. The 19 normal prostate tissues
tested were negative while 16 out of 30 high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas were labelled with anti-lipin-1 antibodies. Bars = 50 µm.

lipin-1 gene expression confirming that this regulation
occurred, at least partly, at the transcriptional level. As
Rac1 is frequently over-expressed or over-activated in
cancers [15-18], we reasoned that lipin-1 might also be
over-expressed in various cancer cell lines as compared
to normal skin fibroblasts or endothelial cells (Fig.1B and
1C). Its expression was stronger in the highly tumorigenic
PC-3 and C4-2B prostatic cell lines than in the low- or
non-tumorigenic prostatic cells (LnCaP and PNT1A,
respectively). Lipin-1 was also found highly expressed
in prostatic cancers in vivo since 16 out of 30 high-grade
human prostate adenocarcinomas were stained with antilipin-1 antibodies. By contrast, the 19 tested normal

prostate tissues were all negative. As illustrated in Fig.1D,
the staining was observed only in epithelial cells and never
in stromal cells and was almost exclusively cytoplasmic.

Lipin-1 silencing repressed cell proliferation in
cancer cells
Lipin-1 was silenced by RNAi to evaluate its
importance for cell phenotype. As observed by Western
blot analysis, lipin-1 expression was strongly repressed
after transfection with specific siRNA in all cell types
tested in the proliferation assay (Fig.2). This inhibition
lasted for at least 4 days and started to recover at day 5

Fig.2: Lipin-1 silencing repressed proliferation of prostate adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells (PC3 and Hs578T) but not proliferation of normal prostate epithelial cells (PNT1A) and human fibroblasts (FIBRO).
Immediately after transfection with a control siRNA (Scr) or with a siRNA targeting lipin-1 (siLipin1(1) or siLipin1(2)) cells were seeded in
24-well plates and collected at the indicated times. The DNA content of each well was measured as described in “Materials and Methods”.

Lipin-1 silencing represses PC-3 cells migration
through RhoA activation

post-transfection (Supplemental Fig. 1). Lipin-1 inhibition
did not affect PC-3 cell survival, as assessed by apoptosis
measurements (Supplemental Fig. 2), but repressed their
proliferation rate as assessed by DNA measurements
and cell counting (Fig.2A and Supplemental Fig.3).
This effect was not limited to PC-3 cells as silencing of
lipin-1 in breast adenocarcinoma cells (Hs578T) also
reduced significantly their proliferation rate (Fig. 2B).
Despite an efficient silencing of lipin-1, control cells
(normal human skin fibroblasts and the non-tumorigenic
prostatic cell line PNT1A) were not affected by lipin-1
repression suggesting that non-tumorigenic cells are less
sensitive to lipin-1 depletion (Fig.2C and Fig.2D). The
second lipin-1 siRNA that is more efficient in silencing
lipin-1 tends also to be more efficient in reducing cancer
cell proliferation (compare Fig.2A to Fig.2E and Fig.2B
to Fig.2F). A similar repression of proliferation of PC-3
cells was also observed in lipid-free medium suggesting
that extracellular lipids are not involved in this process
(Supplemental Fig.4).

To further evaluate the relevance of the silencing of
lipin-1 on cellular functions involved in tumorigenesis,
we evaluated its effect on the migratory properties of
PC-3 cells. In a scratch wound healing assay, lipin-1
silencing decreased the migration of PC-3 cells (Fig.3).
As RhoGTPases are key regulators of cellular migration
[19], the level of the active form of RhoA and Rac1 was
measured by mean of a pull-down assay. We observed
that the activity of RhoA was increased following lipin-1
silencing (Fig.4A) while the activity of Rac1 was not
significantly altered (Fig.4B). As we previously reported
that an excess of RhoA activity can repress migration of
PC-3 cells [20], a simultaneous repression of lipin-1 and
RhoA was performed. As illustrated in Figure 4C, both
proteins were efficiently silenced and the repression of cell
migration due to lipin-1 silencing was abolished (Fig.4D).
RhoA silencing alone did not affect the migration rate,
indicating that the reversal of the inhibitory effect of
lipin-1 silencing is not due to a nonspecific increase of

the migration rate (Fig.4D). By contrast, the depletion of
RhoA did not reverse the effect of lipin-1 silencing on
proliferation (Supplemental Fig.5).

Lipin-1 has emerged as a crucial lipid regulator
acting either as an enzyme or a co-regulator of
transcription [12]. The silencing of lipin-1 did neither
significantly affect the whole lipid synthesis nor

a siRNA targeting RhoA (scr+siA1) or with a siRNA targeting lipin-1 and a siRNA targeting RhoA (siLipin1+siRhoA), cells were processed
for the wound healing assay as described in “Materials and Methods”. An aliquot of the cell suspension was seeded in a dish and collected
48 h after transfection for western blot analysis with specific antibodies to lipin-1, RhoA and Erk1/2 to control the efficiency of silencing

triglyceride concentration nor the expression of fatty
acid synthase but increased the cellular concentration of
phosphatidic acid (PA) (Supplemental Fig.6). By contrast,
it repressed the mRNA expression of ATP citrate lyase
(Supplemental Fig.6), a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes
the generation of acetyl-CoA from citrate and is overexpressed in several types of cancers [6]. A decreased
phosphorylation of AKT and of ribosomal protein S6 was
also observed upon lipin-1 silencing (Fig.5A and Fig.5B).
Autophagy is often induced in cancer cells in order to
maintain a high metabolic rate [14]. We observed that the
repression of lipin-1 induced an accumulation of LC3-II

while p62/SQSTM1 level was not altered (Fig.5C) and
the amount of LC3-II further increased in the presence
of the lysosomal inhibitor E64d (Fig.5D). Moreover,
cells expressing a double tagged LC3 (RFP-GFP-LC3)
and silenced or not for lipin-1 displayed comparable
percentages of autophagosomes (Fig.5E and Fig.5F),
suggesting that the accumulation of LC3-II is not due
to a blockage of autophagosome maturation. These data
support an enhanced autophagic flux following lipin-1
silencing that could help cells to counteract the negative
effect of lipin-1 down-regulation.

were transfected with the indicated siRNA. (A-D) 48 hours after transfection, cells were processed for Western blotting and analyzed with

Manipulation of lipin-1 amount induced a
compensatory regulation of lipin-2

(Supplemental Fig.7). On the reverse, over-expression of
lipin-1 by clones expressing lipin-1 (PC-3/TR/Lipin1) in
a doxycycline-dependent way induced a compensatory
down-regulation of lipin-2. This effect depends on the
catalytic activity of lipin-1 since over-expression of the
phosphatase-dead mutant lipin-1D678E does not influence
the level of lipin-2. The low level of lipin-3 expression
relative to that of lipin-1 and lipin-2 (~10 fold lower)
as evaluated by RT-qPCR and the lack of compensatory
mechanism with the two other lipins [21] motivated us to
not further investigate lipin-3 here.

A reciprocal regulation between lipin-1 and -2, but
not lipin-3, was recently reported [21]. As lipin-1 and
lipin-2 share common functions, an increased lipin-2
expression could partly rescue lipin-1 silencing. As
illustrated in Figure 6A, silencing of lipin-1 induced
an increased expression of lipin-2 in PC-3 cells. This
regulation was also observed in Hs578T cells but not in
human fibroblasts or in control prostatic PNT1A cells

Fig.6: Compensatory regulation between lipin-1 and -2 affects PC-3 phenotype. (A) There is a compensatory regulation of

lipin-2 protein level following modulation of lipin-1 protein level that is dependent on lipin-1 activity. 48 hours after transfection of the
indicated siRNA in PC-3 cells or after induction (+dox) of the expression of lipin-1 (in PC-3/TR/lipin1) or of the expression of inactive
lipin-1 (in PC-3/TR/lipin-1DE), cells were lysed and analyzsed results of three independent experiments. (B) The inhibition of proliferation
mediated by lipin-1 silencing was enhanced following co-silencing of lipin-2. Immediately after transfection with 20 (Scr) or 40 (Scr[2X])

each well was measured as described in “Materials and Methods”. The insert shows Western blot analysis of cell lysates collected 48 h after
transfection with the indicated siRNA with specific antibodies to lipin-1, lipin-2 and Erk1/2. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01 and ***: p< 0.001 as

Lipin-1 and lipin-2 cooperate to regulate cell
proliferation but not cell migration

(Supplemental Fig.8). Altogether, these data demonstrate
that lipin-1 and lipin-2 are both involved in the control of
tumoral cells proliferation but that only lipin-1 regulates
cell migration.

In order to investigate the consequences of the
compensatory increased level of lipin-2 following lipin-1
silencing, we targeted also lipin-2 through RNAi (insert,
Fig.6B). The double silencing of lipin-1 and lipin-2
was very efficient and inhibited cell proliferation more
strongly than the lipin-1 silencing alone, which shows
that lipin-2 can partially compensate for the lack of lipin-1
in this model. By contrast, the inhibition of migration of
PC-3 cells was not affected by the depletion of lipin-2

cells to rapamycin treatment

migration (Fig.7A and Fig.7B). Propranolol also
repressed AKT and S6 protein phosphorylation (Fig.8A
and Fig.8B). An accumulation of LC3-II was also noted
upon propranolol treatment but, on the contrary to lipin-1
silencing, it induced an accumulation of p62 suggesting
a blockage in the late phases of autophagy (Fig.8C and
Fig.8D). This discrepancy with lipin-1 silencing alone is
most likely due to the fact that propranolol completely
inhibits all lipins while specific lipin-1 depletion
with siRNA causes induction of lipin-2. As a whole,
pharmacological inhibition of lipins confirmed their role
in the regulation of the cell phenotype.

Rapamycin is a widely used anti-cancer agent.
However, when used alone, it has often limited effects
mainly due to the loss of negative feedback loops in
cancer cells leading to reactivation of AKT and ribosomal
protein S6. As we observed that phosphorylation of AKT
and ribosomal protein S6 were decreased following
lipin-1 silencing, we hypothesized that lipin-1 silencing
could potentiate the anti-proliferative effect of rapamycin
on cancer cells. A preliminary experiment showed that

Discussion

rapamycin treatment of PC-3 cells in a range of 10 nM
to 1 µM induced a similar repression of proliferation. In
the following experiments, concentrations of 20 and 50
nM of rapamycin were used and gave similar results.
Only the data with the 50 nM concentration are shown.
While rapamycin treatment of PC-3 (Fig.9A and Fig.9C)
and Hs578T cells (Fig.9B) reduced their proliferation rate
by about 60 %, the combination of rapamycin treatment
with lipin-1 silencing almost completely suppressed their
proliferative capacities. Pharmacological concentrations
of propranolol, alone or in association with rapamycin,
also repressed cell proliferation by 40 or almost 100 %,
respectively (Fig.9D) which further demonstrated the
synergistic effect of targeting these two pathways. The
potentiation of the effect of rapamycin by propranolol was
confirmed by direct cell counting (Supplemental Fig.9).

Deregulation of lipid metabolism in various
cancer types makes it an attractive target for anti-cancer
therapies. A first strategy to limit fatty acid availability
would consist in inhibiting lipid synthesis [10]. This
approach was largely used in recent research and led to the
identification of several key enzymes for which targeting
affected cancer cell proliferation and survival. Based on
these data, specific inhibitors have been developed and
are currently being tested in clinic (reviewed by [4-7]).
Fatty acids level can also be decreased by enhancing their
degradation, increasing their storage or blocking their
release from storage. In the lipid storage pathway, lipin-1
is one of the least studied enzymes in cancerogenesis
[10]. We identified lipin-1 as a Rac1 regulated gene,
probably through mTORC1 activation [25] that, in turn,
regulates positively SREBP1 [26], a transcription factor

involved in lipin-1 gene expression [27]. Via mTORC1,
Rac1 could also regulate lipin-1 phosphorylation and,
consequently, its activity and its localization [28]. The
high expression of lipin-1 in various cancer cell lines as
well as its over-expression noticed in about 50 % of high
grade prostate cancer samples prompted us to characterize
its role in cancer cell phenotype. Most of our study was
performed with prostate cancer cells as this type of cancer
is especially dependent on an enhanced lipid metabolism
[29]. In addition, lipin-1 depletion strongly inhibited
cancer cells proliferation while it had only limited effect
on non-cancerous cells. This is a key point for the clinical
relevance of the targeting of this protein. The inhibition
of lipin-1 did not significantly affect whole lipid synthesis
and FASN expression. Lipin-1 is expected to regulate
FASN expression through the inhibition of SREBP1
activity. However, in our model, this transcriptional
function of lipin-1 is likely repressed as lipin-1 seems
highly phosphorylated by a mTOR-dependent pathway
(Supplemental Fig.10A), a modification reported to
prevent its entry into the nucleus [30]. This is in line
with our observations showing that lipin-1 is exclusively
located in the cytoplasm and never in the nucleus of
high-grade adenocarcinoma cells in tumor samples. In
prostate cancer cells, lipin-1 silencing is correlated with
PA accumulation and reduced proliferation, while many
reports indicate that increased concentration of PA is often
correlated with a proliferative phenotype (for review see
[31]). However, these data are not contradictory when
considering the mechanisms leading to the increased
intracellular levels of PA. When high concentration results
from the stimulation of its synthesis (via phospholipase D,
lysophosphatidic acid acetyltransferase or diacylglycerol
kinase), it induces an increased proliferation rate. In
our model, accumulation is due to a decrease in its
conversion into DAG, which affects both PA- and DAGdependent signaling pathways and further impairs the
production of phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine,
phosphatidylcholine, …) used as building blocks for
cell membranes. This mechanism has been proposed to
explain the induction of cell death in U937 cells by a semispecific inhibitor targeting lipin-1 [32]. It has been shown
that lipin-1 is induced in culture conditions where PA is
up-regulated such as serum withdrawal (Supplemental
Fig.10B and [33]) or hypoxia [34, 35] but also in response
to exogenous PA (Supplemental Fig.10C) likely to
regulate lipid homeostasis. Thus, lipin-1 depletion is likely
to trigger both an imbalance between lipid species and a
decrease in nutrient availability that might explain the
decreased phosphorylation of AKT and ribosomal protein
S6 and the increase in autophagy required to fuel the cells
with building blocks and energy. Importantly, the loss of
lipin-1 was recently reported to inhibit the clearance of
autophagy in muscle cells [13]. However, this process
does not seem to operate in prostate cancer cells depleted
in lipin-1. The enhanced level of LC3-II noticed upon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lipin-1 silencing was not associated with an up-regulation
of p62/SQSTM1. In addition, we did not observe any
accumulation of autophagosomes at the expense of
autolysosomes. This discrepancy is likely related to our
experimental model in which lipin-1 depletion is partially
compensated by lipin-2 over-expression. This hypothesis
is further supported by the observation that propranolol,
a pharmacological molecule that completely inhibits
all lipins, also induced both LC3II and p62/SQSTM1
accumulation in PC-3 cells.
The inhibition of cell migration following lipin-1
silencing further enhanced the relevance of lipin-1 to
tumorigenesis. Here, we have demonstrated that this effect
is related to an increased activation of RhoA, a data in
agreement with previous report from our research group
and others demonstrating that an increased activation of
RhoA is sufficient to repress PC-3 cell migration [20, 36].
This RhoA activation in lipin-1-depleted cells could be
related to the increased concentration of PA which can
activate the sphingosine kinase-1 to produce sphingosine1-phosphate [37], a lipid mediator able to enhance RhoA
activity [38], and to inhibit migration of various tumor
cells including PC-3 [36, 38].
It was recently reported that lipin-1 depletion results
in a reciprocal increase in lipin-2 but not lipin-3 expression
[21]. A similar regulation was also observed here in
prostate cancer cells suggesting that this mechanism is
widespread. We further showed that overexpression of
lipin-1 represses lipin-2 expression and that this feedback
dynamic compensation is dependent on the catalytic
activity of lipin-1, a mechanism that has to be taken into
account in any strategy aiming at targeting lipins.
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is over-activated in
several cancers including prostate cancers [39] and much
effort has been devoted to its inhibition. Inhibition of the
mTOR complex 1 with rapamycin or its analogs exerts an
anti-tumoral activity in tumor cell lines and therapeutic
response has been reported for some cancers [40-42].
However, in numerous cancer types including prostate
cancer, mTOR complex 1 inhibition by rapamycin had
a limited therapeutic efficacy in part due to the loss of
negative feedback loops leading to the activation of AKT
by TORC2 [43]. To overcome this resistance, rapamycin
has been successfully combined with other drugs such
as aromatase inhibitors [44] or HDAC inhibitors [4548]. Thus, the identification of proteins whose silencing
synergizes with mTOR inhibition to decrease tumor
growth is of particular interest [49]. The inhibition of AKT
and ribosomal protein S6 activation following lipin-1
silencing was the rationale to associate lipin-1 siRNA and
rapamycin treatment. Since our data demonstrated that
lipin-1 silencing sensitizes prostate and breast cancer cells
to rapamycin, we then verified whether pharmacological
inhibition of lipins activity could be considered as a
potential therapeutic option or not. Propranolol was
initially used as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. It

later on found to be a potent inhibitor of lipins activity.
Used alone, it recapitulates most of the effects of lipin-1
silencing on PC-3 cells phenotype. Most interestingly,
it fully sensitizes PC-3 cells to rapamycin treatment,
similarly to what was observed by using a siRNA targeting
lipin-1. Thus, our data opens the way to new anti-cancer
strategies, especially by providing the rationale to combine
two well-known molecules in human therapy, propranolol
and rapamycin, for the treatment of cancer.

21-nucleotides
long
siRNAs
chemically
synthesized, desalted, deprotected and PAGE purified
were from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). The
sequences of the siRNAs targeting RhoA (siRhoA),
Rac1 (siRac1 and siRac1#2) and of the control siRNA
(siScr) were described and validated previously [20,
52]. The sequences of siRNA used for repressing
lipin-1 or lipin-2 expression were the followings:
siLipin1#1 (5’-GAAUGGAAUGCCAGCUGAATT-3’
and
5’-UUCAGCUGGCAUUCCAUUCTT-3’),
siLipin-1#2 (5’-GAGAGAUGACAACAUGAACTT-3’
and 5’-GUUCAUGUUGUCAUCUCUCTT-3’) and
siLipin-2 (5’-GAUGGCAGCUAUCAGUGUUTT-3’ and
5’-AACACUGAUAGCUGCCAUCTT-3’). Each pair
of oligoribonucleotides was annealed at a concentration
of 20 μM in 50 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5. siRNA transfection was carried out as
previously described [53]. Briefly, calcium phosphatemediated transfection was performed overnight (14-16 h)
on subconfluent cells at a final concentration of 20 nM
siRNA. Cells were washed twice with PBS and once with
complete medium, this last step being defined as time 0
post-transfection. Cells were lysed for Western blot or RTqPCR analysis 48 hours post-transfection.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE lysis buffer
and proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF
Transfer Membrane (NEN Life Science Products).
Membranes were then blocked for 1 hour with 3 % dry
milk in PBS-0.05 % Tween 20 and incubated for 4 h
with the diluted primary antibody. Membranes were then
washed three times, incubated in the diluted secondary
horseradish peroxydase-conjugated antibody for 1 h,
and revealed by chemoluminescence using the ECL kit
(Amersham Biosciences) and X-ray film exposure. The
membranes were re-probed with anti-Erk1/2 antibodies to
control protein loading.

Immunohistochemistry
This protocol was established based on
manufacturer’s instructions. Human prostate carcinoma
paraffin embedded sections (5 µm) were dewaxed and
rehydrated using the following successive baths: 8 min in
xylol, 4 min in xylol, 2 min in 100 % ethanol, 2 min in
95 % ethanol, 2 min in 70 % ethanol and 2 min in H2O.
Antigen retrieval was performed by heating samples in
REALtm Retrieval Solution (Dako) at 120°C for 5 min.
After cooling, endogenous peroxydases were inhibited

using 3 % H2O2 during 20 min at room temperature (RT).
Background staining was reduced by incubating the slides
in 10 % FBS/PBS for 30 min at RT. Sections were then
subsequently incubated with the primary anti-lipin-1
antibody (dilution 1/100) for 1 h at RT then with the biotin
conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1/400) during 45
min and then with HRP conjugated streptavidin (dilution
1/400) during 30 min at RT. Staining was revealed using
AEC+ High Sensitivity Chromogen (Dako) and sections
were counterstained with haematoxylin.

a “Optional Volumetric Flow Sensor” able to measure the
volume over the entire acquisition time.

Migration assay
PC-3 cells were seeded (3x104 cells per well) into
sterile Culture-Insert (#80209, ibidi). After 24 h the
inserts were removed revealing a gap of 500 µm width
in the cell monolayer. This was defined as the 0 h time
of the assay. Phase-contrast micrographs of the gap were
taken, at two random positions for each assay, at time
0 h and after 16 h using Nikon TiS microscope with a
Clara High Resolution CCD camera (Andor), halogen
Fiber Illuminator Intensilight, CFI Plan Fluor DL 10X
0.30 objective (Nikon) and controlled by NIS-Elements
software (Nikon). The surface of the remaining gaps was
measured using NIS-Elements software (Nikon) and the
covered surface was calculated by subtracting the 16 h gap
from the 0 h gap. Bar = 250 µm.

Lipid synthesis, triglycerides and phosphatidic
acid concentration measurements
Rates of lipid synthesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation
were assessed in PC-3 cells 24 h after transfection with the
indicated siRNA. The lipid assay was based on the method
of Lin and collaborators [54] with some modifications.
Briefly, 24 h after transfection, PC-3 cells were incubated
with [3H]acetate (2 μCi/ml; Perkin Elmer; used as a
metabolic precursor of lipids) during 24 h Lipids were
extracted using the chloroform–methanol method, and
lipid radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation
(Lipoluma; Lumac). Triglycerides and phosphatidic acid
content were measured in cells 48 h after transfection
with the indicated siRNA. Lipids were extracted using
the chloroform-methanol method. Triglycerides were
measured by using a a colorimetric assay (Sigma, TR0100)
and the phosphatidic acid content by using a fluorometric
assay kit (Cayman chemical, 700240) following the
instructions of the manufacturer.

GTPase activity assay
The assay was carried out as previously described
[53, 57]. Briefly, cells were chilled on ice and lysed in
ice-cold buffer containing 1 % Triton X-100, 25 mM
HEPES pH; 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 4 % glycerol, 0.1 mM
AEBSF, 4 µg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged for
6 min at 16000 g. Supernatants were immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until used. An
aliquot of each supernatant collected before freezing was
denatured in SDS-PAGE lysis buffer to measure the total
RhoGTPase content by Western blotting. For pull-down
assays, supernatants were incubated for 30 min with 30
µg of GST-PBD protein containing the Cdc42 and Rac
binding region of PAK-1B or 30 µg of GST-RBD protein
containing the RhoA binding region of Rhotekin both
affinity linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads
were washed 4 times in lysis buffer and boiled in 60 µl
SDS-PAGE lysis buffer.

Proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 24 wells costar plates
immediately after transfection with siRNA and collected
at different time points to determine the DNA content by
a fluorimetric technique [55] as previously described [56].
Briefly, cell layers were rinsed three times with saline and
homogenized in PBS by sonication (20 s/well). 100 µl
of each sample were transferred into a 96 well plate and
supplemented with 100 µl of bisbenzimide solution (200
µg/ml bisbenzimide, 4 M NaCl, 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH;
7.4). In each plate a standard curve of DNA (from 2 µg
to .03 µg) was included. The plate was mixed 5 min and
fluorescence was read in a microplate spectrofluorometer
SpectraMax Gemini XS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and
an emission wavelength of 460 nm.
For cell counting, cells were seeded in 12 wells
costar plates immediately after transfection with siRNA.
Cells were detached at different time points with 2.5 %
trypsin-EDTA, pelleted and suspended in 300 µL of PBS.
Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACSVerse (405
nm, 488 nm, 633 nm, walk-away system) equipped with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Real time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from siRNA-transfected
cells using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche
Molecular Biochemical). 1 µg of total RNA was reversed
transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen). Real time qPCR was performed in a final
volume of 20 µl containing 2 µl of cDNA (corresponding
to 10 ng of total RNA for Lipin-1, Lipin-2, Lipin-3, FASN,
ACLY and MAGL amplification and corresponding to 0.1
ng of total RNA for GAPDH amplification), 300 nM of
each primer and 10 µl of the qPCR MasterMix Plus for
SYBR® green (Eurogentec) in the StepOneTM Real-Time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Halle, Belgium). The

using ImageJ software. Micrographs of the cells were
acquired in several focal planes and the analysis performed
on the stacked images. Puncta structures mCherry-positive
and expressing or not EGFP were quantified in more than
50 cells per condition. The proportion of autophagosomes
was expressed as the percent of puncta with both colors.

Generation of PC-3 clones overexpressing
Lipin-1 or Lipin-1D678E under the dependence
of doxycycline

Cell survival and apoptosis

The entire coding sequence of human Lipin-1
was amplified by RT-PCR (forward oligonucleotide
5’-cacacagaattcgcgccgctcggtgcagacca-3’,
reverse
oligonucleotide
5’-cacacactcgagtggcaagaggctgcttgggaca-3’) and cloned
into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen)
(pcDNA4/TO/Lipin1) and sequenced. The mutant
Lipin1D678E was generated using a two-step PCR and
two anti-complementary oligonucleotides possessing a
point mutation (underlined in the sequences) as compared
to the wild type sequence. Two overlapping fragments
covering the entire coding sequence were first amplified
from the pcDNA4/TO/Lipin1 using the following pairs of
primers: 5’-cacacagaattcgcgccgctcggtgcagacca-3’ and 5’gtcccatcaatctcagaaatgatgactttatcatccca-3’ (for the 5’PCR
product) and 5’-cacacactcgagtggcaagaggctgcttgggaca-3’
and 5’- CATCATTTCTGAGATTGATGGGACAATTAC
CAGATCA -3’ (for the3’PCR product). These two
fragments were then mixed in equal amount, denatured,
annealed and elongated before PCR amplification
(using 5’-cacacagaattcgcgccgctcggtgcagacca-3’ and
5’-cacacactcgagtggcaagaggctgcttgggaca-3’ as forward and
reverse primers). The final full size and mutated product
was then digested, cloned into the pcDNA4/TO (pcDNA4/
TO/Lipin1D678E) and sequenced to verify the presence
of the mutation. Clones of PC-3 cells expressing a high
level of tetracycline repressor (PC-3/TR) were previously
described [52]. They were transfected with pcDNA4/
TO/Lipin1 or pcDNA4/TO/Lipin1D678E and selected
in medium supplemented with 1 µg/ml blasticidin + 200
µg/ml zeocinTM. Several clones overexpressing lipin-1 or
lipin-1D678E in a doxycycline-dependent way (PC-3/TR/
Lipin1, PC-3/TR/Lipin1D678E) were isolated and used in
this study.

Cell survival and apoptosis were evaluated by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting after annexin V–
FITC and Propidium Iodide staining. Adherent cells
were detached with 2.5 % trypsin-EDTA, pelleted and
suspended in Annexin binding buffer (Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection kit, Sigma) and incubated for 15
min with Annexin V-FITC (270 ng/ml) and Propidium
Iodide (1.1 µg/ml). Flow cytometry was performed on a
FACSCanto II double LASER flow cytometer (UV, 488
nm, 633 nm) (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed
using FACSDiva Software (BD Biosciences).
