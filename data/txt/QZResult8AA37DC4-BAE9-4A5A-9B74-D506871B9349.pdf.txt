ABSTRACT
The current gold standard for prostate cancer treatment is androgen deprivation
therapy and antiandrogenic agents. However, adverse cardiovascular events including
heart failure can limit therapeutic use. Istaroxime, which combines Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA)
inhibition with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) stimulation,
has recently shown promising anti-neoplastic effects in prostate cancer (PC) models
and may also improve cardiac function. Considering the promising anticancer effects of
istaroxime, we aimed to assess its functional effects on human myocardium.
Results: Istaroxime and strophanthidin elicited dose-dependent positive inotropic
effects with a decline in developed force at supraphysiological concentrations in
human atrial, nonfailing, and failing ventricular (ToF) myocardium. Diastolic force
and RT50% did not change after exposure to both drugs. The maximal developed force
in our in-vitro model of heart failure (ToF) was significantly higher after istaroxime
administration. Such a difference did not occur in atrial or nonfailing ventricular
trabeculae and was not applicable to the diastolic force.
Materials and Methods: Human atrial and ventricular trabeculae were isolated from
nonfailing hearts and hearts of infants with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), which were used as
an in-vitro model of heart failure. The samples were electrically stimulated and treated
with increasing concentrations of istaroxime and strophanthidin (10 nM–1 µM). Systolic
and diastolic force development and relaxation parameters (RT50%) were analyzed.
Conclusions: Combined NKA inhibition/SERCA2a stimulation increases
contractility in atrial, nonfailing, and failing myocardium. Considering that heart
failure is a potential side effect of current PC treatments, especially in elderly patients,
istaroxime might combine beneficial cardiac and anti-cancer properties.

INTRODUCTION

Although istaroxime may not make it to market
as a HF drug, it continues to show potential as an anticancer drug. Istaroxime showed promising anti-neoplastic
effects in the cell lines of 9 different types of cancer and a
reduction of tumor growth in vivo in PC xenograft models.
Furthermore, the authors of this study identified a putative
crosstalk between the inhibition of NKA and membranebound androgen receptor and down-stream signaling
[17]. This data fits well with the results of previous
studies, which demonstrated that NKA inhibitors have a
strong anti-neoplastic potential [18–20]. Of note, HF and
PC share risk factors such as age and hyperlipidaemia
[21, 22]. Since the cardiovascular complications of current
androgen deprivation therapeutics can significantly limit
their usage, evaluating the cardiovascular safety profiles
of newly developed drugs is essential.
Therefore, we tested the functional effects of
istaroxime on human nonfailing atrial and ventricular
myocardium and a unique in-vitro model of heart failure
with diastolic dysfunction. This model is especially
valuable considering that impaired relaxation is a
common condition in many elderly patients who have
HF with preserved ejection fraction. For comparison, we
performed experiments with the same conditions using
the NKA inhibitor strophanthidin, as previous studies
have already determined its functional impact on human
myocardium [23].

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common malignant
disease in elderly men in western countries [1]. There
has been an increase in the availability of diagnostic
tools for PC, such as prostate-specific-antigen-based
screening tests, and advancements in therapeutics that
have resulted in a decline in the total number of fatal PC
rates [2]. Despite the improvements in both diagnosing
and treating the disease, it is still associated with moderate
mortality rates, partially attributed to stable rates of fatal
PC in younger men [3]. A study using the “Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)” data of the
United States found that PC accounts for approximately
19% of all newly diagnosed cases of cancer in men and
approximately 8% of all deaths due to cancer in men
in 2017 [1]. The study also reported a median age at
time of diagnosis of 66 years and a median age at time
of death of 80 years, underlining the age-associated
nature of this disease [4]. The current gold-standard
conservative approach for PC is androgen deprivation
therapy, which is used as an adjunctive treatment strategy
in localized high-risk PC or as a continuous treatment for
metastatic PC patients. In addition, novel antiandrogens
(enzalutamide) and androgen biosynthesis inhibitors
(abiraterone) are approved in the setting of metastatic PC
before and after docetaxel chemotherapy. Furthermore,
these agents are currently being investigated in clinical
trials for their efficacy in a non-metastatic PC setting [5].
However, increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such
as coronary artery diseases, acute myocardial infarction
and heart failure (HF), are reported as limiting side effects
and contraindications for some of these drugs. This may
significantly limit their therapeutic use [6–10].
Istaroxime, a novel drug originally developed
for treating HF, received attention for its potential antineoplastic effects. Istaroxime inhibits Na+-K+-ATPase
(NKA), like strophanthidin, and exerts additional
stimulatory effects on the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum
Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a). It has exhibited lusitropic
and inotropic properties in experimental and early clinical
studies [11]. Preclinical studies and clinical trials indicate
that combining SERCA2a activation and NKA inhibition
may increase contractility and facilitate active relaxation,
improving systolic as well as diastolic heart function, both
of which would be beneficial effects in the treatment of
chronic HF [12, 13]. Early data from human studies have
shown that istaroxime increases systolic blood pressure,
decreases heart rate, decreases pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure, and possibly improves diastolic function without
increasing myocardial oxygen consumption or causing
a significant change in ischemic or arrhythmic events
[13–16]. However, larger clinical trials with the purpose of
exploring the clinical usage of istaroxime in HF were never
performed, thus guideline-based indications do not exist.

RESULTS
Functional effects of istaroxime and
strophanthidin in human atrial myocardium
We assessed the effects of NKA inhibition alone
(strophanthidin; n = 13 trabeculae) versus NKA inhibition
combined with SERCA stimulation (istaroxime; n = 8
trabeculae) on developed force in human atrial trabeculae.
Increasing concentrations of strophanthidin increased the
developed force with a maximum effect at 0.1 µM. The
developed force declined further as the concentration
was increased. Similarly, increasing concentrations of
istaroxime (black circles) produced a positive inotropic
effect with a maximum effect at 0.3 µM and subsequent
force decline at higher concentrations (Figure 1A). Both
strophanthidin and istaroxime slightly increased diastolic
force compared to baseline in a dose-dependent manner
with comparable kinetics of the curves (Figure 1B).
Next, we performed force-frequency relationship (FFR)
experiments by increasing stimulation frequencies
stepwise (0.5–3.0Hz) before and after incubation with
either istaroxime or strophantidin. FFR results are shown
in the supplement (Supplementary Figure 1A–1D).
Similar effects between strophanthidin and istaroxime
could be observed. No arrhythmic events were detected
for istaroxime or strophanthidin in any of the experiments

reveal any significant differences between istaroxime and
strophanthidin in dose response relationship (DRR) or

dependent and comparable manner. Maximum effect on
systolic force was seen at 0.3 µM for both substances.
Developed force declined as the concentration was
increased up to 1 µM. Figure 1D shows the effect of
strophanthidin and istaroxime on diastolic force. Both
substances showed a dose-dependent increase in diastolic
force compared to baseline with comparable kinetics of
the curves. Results from the FFR in ventricular nonfailing
human myocardium are presented in the supplement
(Supplementary Figure 2A–2D). As observed in the
FFR protocol in atrial trabeculae, strophanthidin and
istaroxime exerted similar effects and no arrhythmic
events could be detected for istaroxime or strophanthidin
in any experiments. Consistent with the findings in atrial
myocardium, the RT50% was not different between

Functional effects of istaroxime and
strophanthidin in human nonfailing ventricular

Next, we investigated the effects of istaroxime and
strophanthidin in isolated ventricular trabeculae from
human nonfailing donor hearts. Analogous to our findings
in atrial trabeculae, strophanthidin (n = 9 trabeculae)
and istaroxime (n = 9 trabeculae) increased developed
force in ventricular trabeculae (Figure 1C) in a dose-

force between drugs in neither atrial (Figure 3A–3B) nor
nonfailing ventricular (Figure 3C–3D) trabeculae. The
same analyses were performed on data obtained from FFR
experiments. Increasing stimulation frequencies did not
reveal any significant differences between istaroxime and
strophanthidin on maximal developed force, diastolic force
or RT50% in atrial or nonfailing ventricular myocardium
(Supplementary Figure 4A–4F). Thus, istaroxime
exerts stronger maximal positive inotropic effects than
strophanthidin in failing ventricular myocardium.

Functional effects of istaroxime and
strophanthidin in failing ventricular myocardium
from patients diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot
After testing the effects of istaroxime and
strophanthidin in atrial and ventricular nonfailing
trabeculae, we had the unique opportunity to measure
inotropic response in failing ventricular trabeculae
isolated from patients diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot
(ToF). ToF is the most frequent cyanotic congenital
heart defect. The anatomic abnormalities of ToF, such
as interventricular communication, subpulmonary
stenosis, biventricular origin of the aortic valve, and right
ventricular hypertrophy cause right ventricular restrictive
physiology and impaired relaxation [24, 25]. Figure 2
shows the effects of istaroxime (n = 11 trabeculae) versus
strophanthidin (n = 8 trabeculae) on developed force
(Figure 2A), diastolic force (Figure 2B) and RT50%
(Figure 2C). Both substances exhibited dose-dependent
positive inotropic effects with a maximal inotropic
effect at 0.3 µM. Consistent with our findings from
nonfailing atrium and ventricle, continuing to increase the
concentration reversed the effects of both substances in
the failing myocardium. Diastolic force (Figure 2B) and
RT50% (Figure 2C) did not change with istaroxime or
strophanthidin administration. An FFR protocol was not
performed since the number of acquired trabeculae from
the ToF tissue was too little for an experimental series. No
arrhythmic events were observed in any of the experiments
performed using failing ventricular myocardium.

DISCUSSION
Our major findings are: (1) istaroxime has positive
inotropic effects in human atrial, human nonfailing
ventricular, and human failing ventricular myocardium;
(2) istaroxime and strophanthidin show comparable effects
with respect to dose response (DRR) and force-frequency
relationship (FFR); (3) istaroxime has stronger maximal
positive inotropic effects than strophanthidin in failing
human myocardium.

Functional and toxic effects of istaroxime and
strophanthidin in human myocardium
The DRR that was performed to compare the effects
of strophanthidin and istaroxime on the developed force in
human atrial, nonfailing ventricular, and failing ventricular
trabeculae (ToF) showed that increased concentrations of
istaroxime as well as strophanthidin resulted in a positive
inotropic response. Supraphysiological concentrations
of istaroxime and strophanthidin exhibited a toxic effect
causing a decline in developed force. These results are
similar to what has previously been reported on the effects
of istaroxime in murine ventricular myocytes, where cell
shortening (inotropy) was investigated in a concentrationdependent fashion [26]. Chronic istaroxime has also
been shown to improve cardiac function and heart rate
variability in hamster cardiomyopathy models [27]. In
our study, both istaroxime and strophanthidin slightly
increased diastolic force in a dose-dependent manner
compared to baseline with comparable curve kinetics in
atrial and nonfailing ventricular myocardium. Overall,
strophanthidin and istaroxime had similar functional
effects in human atrial, nonfailing and failing ventricular
myocardium. The similarities in the DRR and FFR were
unexpected, especially when considering the mechanistic
effects of istaroxime [28], and taking into account the fact
that istaroxime is significantly less pro-arrhythmic than
digoxin [26]. In our experiments, neither strophanthidin
nor istaroxime treatment resulted in any detected
arrhythmic events, even at high concentrations of both
substances and high Ca2+ concentrations (2.5 mM) used
in all experiments. This data implicates a comparable
safety profile for istaroxime with respect to other NKA
inhibitors.

Istaroxime exerts stronger maximal positive
inotropic effects than strophanthidin in failing
myocardium (ToF)
In order to better compare the inotropic effects
caused by strophanthidin and istaroxime, we used the
data from the DRR for atrial, nonfailing ventricular, and
failing ventricular trabeculae to focus on the maximal
developed force, regardless of the concentration at which
the maximum was reached. Figure 3 shows box plots of
the maximal developed force and of the corresponding
diastolic force, respectively. The analysis revealed a
significant difference in the respective influence of
istaroxime and strophanthidin on maximal developed
force in failing hearts (Figure 3E). The maximal developed
force in failing trabeculae was significantly higher in
the istaroxime group than in the strophanthidin group
(283% ± 26% of baseline vs. 186% ± 21% of baseline,
p = 0.009). The diastolic force measured at the time
of maximal developed force did not differ between
istaroxime and strophanthidin (Figure 3F). We did not
observe significant differences in the maximal developed

both compounds is mediated through NKA inhibition,
with subsequent increase of intracellular Ca2+. Our
findings in atrial and nonfailing ventricular myocardium
suggest istaroxime and strophanthidin inhibit the NKA
to a similar extent. The exact extent of NKA inhibition
by istaroxime compared to strophanthidin has never
been quantified. Since ToF is a condition with impaired
relaxation and restrictive right ventricular physiology
[25, 29], we can only speculate that the additional
SERCA2a stimulation by istaroxime in a setting of
impaired relaxation is responsible for a more pronounced
increase in maximal developed force. We conclude that in
our in-vitro model of HF, istaroxime has stronger maximal
positive inotropic effects than strophanthidin. This is in
line with the results of experiments using a canine model
of acute myocardial infarction where istaroxime had a
greater effect on contractility than dobutamine and also
improved relaxation, while dobutamine did not [30].
Our in-vitro DRR findings further complement the
findings from the HORIZON-HF trial, where istaroxime
was tested in acute heart failure syndromes using a
comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular function
in addition to hemodynamic measurements [31]. Other
studies performed in dogs with advanced heart failure
showed istaroxime significantly increased LV ejection
fraction in a dose-dependent manner. In addition,
istaroxime significantly reduced LV end-diastolic pressure
and end-diastolic wall stress [15]. The latter effect
contradicts with our findings. Another phase 1–2 doseescalating study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
istaroxime suggested that istaroxime is potentially useful
in the treatment of HF [32]. We found only one report on
the effects of istaroxime using myocardial trabeculae from
patients undergoing cardiac transplantation [33]. In that
study, istaroxime (100 nM - 1.0 µM) increased developed
tension and twitch kinetics in a dose-dependent manner
while stimulating SERCA2a activity in sarcoplasmic
reticulum microsomes at physiological free calcium
concentrations. Istaroxime is currently the only compound
available that stimulates SERCA2a activity and produces
a luso-inotropic effect in HF [33].

(ESC) heart failure guidelines [36]. NKA inhibitors
may provide additional help in treatment with a class of
recommendation IIb and a level of evidence B. This low
class of recommendation is due to the potential harmful
effects of digoxin for women [37] and controversial
reported effects in meta-analysis for both digoxin and
digitoxin [38–40]. In summary, NKA inhibition does not
lower mortality but does seem to lower the incidence of
decompensation of heart failure and the hospitalization
rate for heart failure. Of note, istaroxime is not currently
featured as an established approach in the ESC guidelines
for heart failure. However, the reported negative effects
for women caused by the NKA inhibitor digoxin are not an
issue in terms of its use as a PC treatment. Keeping in mind
that HF can develop as a side effect of hormonal therapy
in PC, the additional use of inotropes could be beneficial.
Moreover, istaroxime itself exerts PC inhibiting effects.
The median age of PC patients at time of diagnosis is
66 years. HF patients, especially those diagnosed with
Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF),
are also usually at an advanced age [41]. HFpEF
accounts for about 50% of all cases of HF [42–44] and
its prevalence relative to Heart Failure with reduced
Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is growing by 10% per decade
[44]. The vast majority of published reports assessing
the effects of istaroxime focused on preclinical HFrEF
models and HFrEF patients. We tested istaroxime in a
novel in-vitro HF model with diastolic impairment, which
is a hallmark of HFpEF, and demonstrated that istaroxime
exerts stronger maximal inotropic effects compared to
strophanthidin.
The presented information suggests that istaroxime
has the potential to be a beneficial add-on therapy for
PC, exerting direct anti-cancer effects and counteracting
potential side effects of the basic therapy with respect to
toxic effects at supraphysiological concentrations.

Limitations and strengths of the study
Compared to established animal models that mimic
heart failure, our HF model is not a classic experimental
model of heart failure with preserved or reduced
ejection fraction. However, the use of human tissue for
all experiments enhances the translational nature of our
findings. The study is clearly limited by the small number
of ToF patients as a source of failing ventricular trabeculae,
resulting in a rather small number of experiments.
We did not directly dissect the inhibitory effect
on the NKA from the stimulatory effect on SERCA2a.
However via comparison to the NKA inhibitor
strophanthidin, which has no known SERCA2a
stimulatory effect, our results suggest that SERCA2a
stimulation plays a role. To the best of our knowledge, no
study has attempted to determine which SERCA isoform is
primarily expressed in ventricular ToF myocardium. This
is relevant since istaroxime is effective on the SERCA2a

NKA inhibition in heart failure and potential
link to prostate cancer
Classical inotropic agents, such as beta1-adrenergic
agonists, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors and Ca2+
sensitizers improve HF symptoms and hemodynamics
by increasing the levels of free intracellular Ca2+ and
thus contractility, but also increase myocardial oxygen
demand and exert arrhythmogenic effects [34]. Despite
the acute hemodynamic benefits, these inotropes play no
role in the management of chronic advanced HF due to
inherent adverse side-effect profiles [11, 15, 35]. Instead,
a very well established protocol of therapeutic escalation

isoform in the presence of phospholamban, but not on the
SERCA1 alone [45].
On the other hand, the strength of this study is that it
was performed in human tissue and carefully assessed the
effects of istaroxime and strophanthidin in atrial, nonfailing,
and failing ventricular myocardium. Our HF model is of
high value, yet no single model can entirely reflect the
complexity of heart failure as a clinical syndrome.

For each separate group (atrium, nonfailing
ventricle, failing ventricle), we performed a repeated
measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA) with all data
rank transformed. P-values for contrasts were corrected
for multiple comparisons according to Bonferroni.
Differences in maximum were assessed with the Wilcoxon
rank sum test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All computations were done using
IBM SPSS Statistics (Release 21.0.0.0 2012. Armonk,
NY, USA). Detailed statistical analysis is provided in the
supplement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We assessed three different types of human cardiac
tissue: right atrial appendages, nonfailing left ventricles,
and right ventricles from infants diagnosed with Tetralogy
of Fallot (ToF). The ToF tissue served as a heart failure
model.

CONCLUSIONS
This is the first report of the functional effects of
istaroxime on human myocardium under conditions
similar to HF. We found close similarities between
istaroxime and strophanthidin in their effect on systolic
force, diastolic force, and relaxation time in nonfailing
tissue. However, using ToF as a model of heart failure,
istaroxime showed stronger maximal positive inotropic
effects than strophanthidin. Combining our in-vitro
results with potential PC inhibiting effects, istaroxime
may provide a new therapeutic option for conservative
management of PC that counteracts harmful side effects of
current therapy strategies and merits further investigation
of its clinical use.

Human myocardium and trabeculae preparation
Right atrial appendages were obtained from
hearts of patients (n = 22 patients) undergoing cardiac
surgery for aortocoronary bypass or valve replacement.
Left ventricular trabeculae were obtained from human
nonfailing donor hearts (n = 8 hearts) that were not
suitable for transplantation. ToF right ventricular tissue,
which was considered the failing sample, was obtained
during the surgical reconstruction procedure of the right
ventricular outflow tract (n = 9 patients). The study was
approved by the local ethics committee and patients gave
informed written consent. Endocardial trabeculae were
prepared in cardioprotective solution, as described in the
supplement.

concentrations of either istaroxime or strophanthidin
(10 nM to 1 µM). After 30 minutes of incubation and
reaching steady-state conditions, developed force,
diastolic force, and RT50% were recorded. Then the
next concentration step was performed. Moreover, we
performed FFR by increasing stimulation frequency
stepwise from 0.5 Hz to 3.0 Hz. Upon reaching a

was repeated in the presence of 0.1 µM istaroxime or
