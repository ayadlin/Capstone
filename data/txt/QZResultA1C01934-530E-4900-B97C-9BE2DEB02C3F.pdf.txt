Abstract
Taxol chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic options
for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
However, the working mechanisms for Taxol are not fully
understood. Here, we showed that treatment of 22Rv1, a PTENpositive CRPC cell line, with paclitaxel and its semisynthetic
analogue docetaxel decreases expression of the androgen receptor (AR)–activated genes prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
and Nkx3.1 but increases expression of the AR repression gene
maspin, suggesting that Taxol treatment inhibits AR activity.
This was further supported by the observation that the activity of AR luciferase reporter genes was inhibited by paclitaxel.
In contrast, paclitaxel treatment failed to inhibit AR activity
in the PTEN-null CRPC cell line C4-2. However, pretreatment
of C4-2 cells with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor
LY294002 restored paclitaxel inhibition of the AR. Treatment
of 22Rv1 xenografts in mice with docetaxel induced mitotic
arrest and a decrease in PSA expression in tumor cells adjacent to vascular vessels. We further showed that paclitaxel
induces nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, a known AR suppressive nuclear factor, and increases the association of
FOXO1 with AR proteins in the nucleus. FOXO1 knockdown
with small interfering RNA attenuated the inhibitory effect
of paclitaxel on AR transcriptional activity, expression of
PSA and Nkx3.1, and cell survival. These data reveal a previously uncharacterized, FOXO1-mediated, AR-inhibitory effect
of Taxol in CRPC cells that may play an important role in
Taxol-mediated inhibition of CRPC growth. [Cancer Res 2009;
69(21):8386–94]

Introduction
The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Because prostate cancer
cells rely on androgens for proliferation and survival, androgen
deprivation therapy is currently a standard treatment for advanced, metastatic prostate cancer. However, the effectiveness of
androgen deprivation therapy is temporary, and tumors in the
majority of patients eventually relapse and evolve into castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC), from which most patients die
(1, 2). Paradoxically, increasing evidence from both in vitro and

in vivo studies suggest that prostate cancer at this stage is still
dependent on the AR for growth and survival (3, 4). This notion
is further supported by the recent findings that although serum
testosterone levels are known to be significantly reduced following androgen deprivation therapy, intraprostatic androgens are
reproducibly detected at concentrations sufficient to activate the
AR (5). It is believed that such residual levels of intraprostatic
androgens following androgen deprivation therapy are essential
for continuous growth of CRPC cells, stressing that the AR remains
the major target for the treatment of CRPC.
Improving and optimizing therapeutic strategies for men with
CRPC is one of the most challenging aspects of prostate cancer
management today. Until recently, treatment options for such patients were limited and chemotherapy, in particular, provided response rates in the order of only 6%. Lately, however, due to recent
success in the development of less toxic regimens, including Taxol
(paclitaxel and docetaxel), and effective markers for tumor response, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), chemotherapy
can now be used to induce a regression in CRPC after failure of
androgen deprivation therapy. Randomized clinical trials have
shown that, in addition to the improvement of the overall survival
rate, treatment of CRPC patients with docetaxel/paclitaxel plus
prednisone or estramustine resulted in at least 50% decline in
PSA in 50% of the patients (6–8). Docetaxel is now approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients
with CRPC. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the Taxolinduced decline of serum PSA are not entirely clear.
Multiple mechanisms have been elucidated for Taxol-mediated
chemotherapy of human cancers. First, these compounds are
known to inhibit the depolymerization of microtubules and thereby block the exit from mitosis and ultimately promote apoptotic
cell death (9). They have also been shown to kill cancerous cells
by inducing phosphorylation and inhibition of the antiapoptotic
protein Bcl-2 (10). Moreover, several studies have shown that paclitaxel induces apoptosis of breast and ovarian cancer cells by inducing nuclear localization of FOXO transcription factors and
upregulation of their target gene Bim (11–13). Most recently, it
has been shown that activation of FOXO1 inhibits androgen-independent activation of the AR and that this effect of FOXO1 requires
its localization in the nucleus (14). In the present study, we sought
to test the hypothesis that Taxol inhibits AR activity via the nuclear
function of FOXO1. We showed that treatment of 22Rv1 CRPC cells
with Taxol inhibits AR activity and this effect of Taxol is mediated
primarily by increased association of FOXO1 with AR proteins.

Taxol Inhibits AR Activity

Figure 1. Paclitaxel negatively regulates
survival and expression of AR targeted
genes in 22Rv1 CRPC cells. A, effect of
paclitaxel on apoptosis. 22Rv1 cells were
treated with different concentrations of
paclitaxel. After 48 h of treatment, cells
were harvested, fixed, and stained
with propidium iodide and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis was
done and sub-G1 cells were considered
dead. B and C, effect of paclitaxel on
expression of AR target genes. 22Rv1 cells
were treated with different concentrations
of paclitaxel. After 48 h of treatment, cells
were harvested for mRNA and protein
analysis. The expression levels of PSA,
Nkx3.1, and maspin mRNA were examined
by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis (B,
top). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase mRNA was used as an
internal control (B, top). The level of the AR
protein was assessed by Western blot
(B, bottom). The relative mean mRNA
expression level of AR regulated genes
was measured by quantitative real-time
RT-PCR in triplicate. Expression levels are
relative to vehicle treatment, which was
arbitrarily set to 1 (C).

Type Culture Collection. The C4-2 cell line was purchased from UroCor. All
cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone), 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 100 units/mL penicillin.
Plasmids, small interfering RNAs, and chemicals. The expression
vector for FLAG-FOXO1 was described previously (15). The PSA luciferase
reporter (PSA-Luc) that contains ∼5.8-kb genomic fragment from the promoter of the PSA gene and the luciferase reporter construct containing
three copies of the androgen-responsive element (ARE) derived from the
PSA gene (3×ARE-Luc) were obtained from C.Y. Young. The Renilla luciferase reporter vector was purchased from Promega. The FOXO1 gene-specific
small interfering RNA (siRNA; 5′-CCAGAUGCCUAUACAAACA-3′) and nonspecific control siRNA (5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′) were purchased
from Dharmacon. Paclitaxel and docetaxel were purchased from SigmaAldrich. LY294002 was obtained from Invitrogen.
Cell transfection and luciferase reporter assay. Transient transfection of prostate cancer cells was done by electroporation as described
(16). Transfection efficiencies (∼75-90%) were routinely achieved. For siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with 200 pmol siGenome siRNAs
specific for FOXO1 and nonspecific control siRNA. For luciferase reporter
assays, cells were transfected with plasmids for PSA-Luc or 3×ARE-Luc firefly and Renilla luciferase reporter genes. At 24 h after transfection, cells
were treated with paclitaxel. After 48 h of treatment, cells were harvested
and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured
using a dual luciferase kit (Promega). Renilla luciferase activities of cells
were used as internal control.

Reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Total
cellular RNAs were isolated from Taxol- or mock-treated prostate cancer
cells or grafts using Trizol (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were synthesized using
SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was done using
primers specific for PSA (forward 5′-AGGCCTTCCCTGTACACCAA-3′ and
reverse 5′-GTCTTGGCCTGGTCATTTCC-3′), Nkx3.1 (forward 5′GTACCTGTCAGCCCCTGAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGAGAGCTGCTTTCGCTTAG-3′), maspin (forward 5′-CCCTATGCAAAGGAATTGGA-3′ and reverse
5′-CAAAGTGGCCATCTGTGAGA-3′), AR (forward 5′-TGTCCATCTTGTCGTCTTCG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGTCAGCTTCTGGGTTGTC-3′),
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′).
PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide (0.5 μg/mL). For the quantitative real-time PCR, expression levels of genes examined were determined using a SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) on an iCycler iQ platform (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were carried out in triplicate and gene expression levels were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase.
Nuclear extraction, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and
antibodies. Nuclear extraction was done as described (17). Protein immunoprecipitations were carried out using an immunoprecipitation kit (Roche
Applied Science) as described (15), and immunoblotting was done as described (15). The antibodies used were anti-FOXO1 and anti-FOXO1-S256-p
(Cell Signaling Technology); anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich); anti-Bim

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. 22Rv1 cells were transfected
with FLAG-tagged wild-type FOXO1. At 24 h after transfection, cells were
treated with or without paclitaxel for 48 h. Cells were crosslinked with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 min, harvested, lysed in chromatin immunoprecipitation lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0, and 1×
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)], and sonicated to produce soluble chromatin with the genomic DNA at an average size of 400 to 1,000 bp.
The soluble chromatin was precleared by incubation with sheared salmon
sperm DNA. One portion of the supernatant was used as a DNA input control, and the remainder was incubated with mouse IgG or M2 antibody
overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed successively
with wash buffer [300 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 2.7 mmol/L
KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% deoxycholate] and Tris-EDTA. The bound
protein-DNA immunocomplexes were eluted three times with 35 μL chromatin immunoprecipitation elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3)
and de-crosslinked at 65°C for 4 h. The DNA was extracted with a PCR
purification kit (Invitrogen) and subjected to PCR amplification using the
primers specific for the region surrounding the ARE in the PSA promoter
(forward 5′-TCTGCCTTTGTCCCCTAGAT-3′ and reverse 5′-AACCTTCATTCCCCAGGACT-3′). The PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose
gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The effect of paclitaxel on the association of FOXO1 with the PSA promoter was also quantified by real-time
PCR. Ct values of immunoprecipitated samples were normalized to the
corresponding value for input.
Apoptotic cell death assay and cell viability assay. 22Rv1 cells were
treated with different concentrations of paclitaxel. At 48 h after treatment,
cells were collected and washed with 1× PBS. After fixation with 70% ethanol, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and stained with a solution containing 20 mg/mL propidium iodide and 50 mg/mL RNase A. Cells were
incubated for 30 min at room temperature and sub-G1 cells were measured
by flow cytometry using FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Cell viability assay
was done as described (14).
Caspase-3 activity measurement. The activity of caspase-3 was measured by Caspase-3/CPP32 Colorimetric Protease Assay (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 50 μL chilled lysis buffer and incubated on ice
for 10 min. Cellular proteins (100 μg) were diluted in 50 μL lysis buffer and
50 μL reaction buffer (containing 10 mmol/L DTT). Five microliters of the
4 mmol/L DEVD-pNA substrate (200 μmol/L final concentration) were
added, and the reaction was carried out at 37°C for 2 h in the dark. The
results were recorded in a microplate reader at 405 nm.
Xenografting and immunohistochemistry. Eight-week-old male nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice bred through the
BC Cancer Research Centre (BC Cancer Agency) were used in the experiments. 22Rv1 cells were grafted under renal capsule in nonobese diabetic/

severe combined immunodeficient mice as described (18). After 4 weeks of
grafting, mice were treated with docetaxel via i.p. injection at a dose of 15
mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15. Control mice were sham treated with saline at
the same schedule. At 24 h after the last treatment, mice were sacrificed
and 22Rv1 renal grafts were collected. One portion of each graft was snap
frozen for RNA extraction and the rest was fixed in formalin and paraffin
embedded for histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses as described (19). The mouse anti-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the mouse
anti-human PSA antibody (DAKO) was used for immunohistochemical
staining. All sections used for immunohistochemistry were lightly counterstained with 5% (w/v) Harris hematoxylin.
Statistics. Experiments were carried out with three or more replicates.
Statistical analyses were done by Student's t test. P values < 0.05 are considered significant.

Results
Taxol inhibits AR transcriptional activity in 22Rv1 CRPC
cells. Clinical studies show that administration of paclitaxel or
docetaxel decreases serum levels of PSA in patients with CRPC
(6–8). To test the possibility that Taxol-induced decrease in PSA
levels could be due to the inhibition of AR, we examined the effect
of Taxol on expression of several AR-regulated genes in 22Rv1, a
CRPC cell line that expresses both AR and PSA (20). Treatment
of 22Rv1 cells with paclitaxel induced apoptosis in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1A). As shown by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR), paclitaxel treatment decreased expression of AR transactivated genes PSA and Nkx3.1 at the mRNA level (Fig. 1B). No change
was found in expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting that decreased expression of
AR target genes is not likely mediated by paclitaxel-induced apo‐
ptotic cell death but may be mediated by specific inhibition of AR
activity by paclitaxel. This notion is further supported by the observation that paclitaxel treatment increased expression of the
AR-repressed gene maspin in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B).
These results were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR
(Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in 22Rv1 cells treated with
docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To further explore whether paclitaxel inhibits AR activity in prostate cancer cells, we examined the effect of paclitaxel on AR transcriptional activity using PSA promoter-based luciferase reporter
assays. Paclitaxel treatment decreased promoter activity of the
PSA gene in 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 2A). Importantly, treatment of 22Rv1

cells with paclitaxel also inhibited the activity of a composite AR
reporter gene (3×ARE-Luc) that contains three copies of the ARE
from the PSA proximal promoter (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on PSA promoter activity is mediated
through the AR. Thus, we conclude that Taxol can inhibit AR transcriptional activity in 22Rv1 cells in culture. Notably, little or no
change in AR protein levels was observed in 22Rv1 cells treated with
1 nmol/L paclitaxel for 48 h (Fig. 1B). Under the same conditions,
however, expression of PSA and Nkx3.1 increased and maspin
expression increased in comparison with mock-treated cells
(Fig. 1B and C). Similarly, treatment of 22Rv1 cells with 2.5 nmol/L
docetaxel resulted in a marked decrease in expression of PSA
and Nkx3.1 but increase in expression of maspin (Supplementary
Fig. S1A), whereas no change in AR protein levels was observed
under this condition (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These data indicate
that Taxol-induced inhibition of AR activity is not simply caused by
reduced AR protein levels.

AR activity under in vivo conditions. 22Rv1 cells were grafted under the renal capsule of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Because paclitaxel and docetaxel had a
similar inhibitory effect on AR activity in prostate cancer cells

in vitro (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1) and docetaxel is an approved chemotherapeutic agent for CRPC patients in the clinic,
docetaxel was chosen for in vivo studies. After 4 weeks of grafting, mice were treated with docetaxel via i.p. injection at a dose
of 15 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15. Control mice were mock treated with saline at the same schedule. At 24 h after the last treatment, mice were sacrificed. The docetaxel-treated grafts (n = 8)
or mock-treated grafts (n = 6) were collected. Real-time RT-PCR
analysis with total RNA isolated from the entire frozen tissue
showed that there was a slight, but not significant, decrease in
expression of PSA mRNA in grafts treated with docetaxel relative
to those mock-treated grafts (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Similar
analysis showed that there was only a modest, but not significant,
increase in maspin expression in grafts treated with docetaxel
in comparison with those treated with saline (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Analysis with the same RNA samples showed that no
significant change in AR mRNA levels was observed in tumors
treated with docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S2B). However, histologic analysis revealed that mitotic figures (abnormal microtubular bundles) were readily detected in tumor cells aligned with
vascular vessels in xenografts treated with docetaxel but not with
saline (Fig. 3A). In agreement with these observations, an apparent
decrease in expression of AR and PSA proteins was detected in cells

surrounding blood vessels in docetaxel-treated xenografts in comparison with sham-treated counterparts (Fig. 3B and C). These data
indicate that the therapeutic effect of docetaxel, as indicated by the
mitotic arrest, is correlated with decreased expression of PSA in
tumor cells adjacent to vascular vessels but not in the entire tumor.

Paclitaxel induces expression and nuclear localization of
FOXO1 protein and increases its association with the AR in
prostate cancer cells. To define the molecular mechanism by
which Taxol promotes the inhibition of AR activity, we focused
our attention on FOXO1 due to the following reasons: (a) paclitaxel

Figure 4. Paclitaxel induces expression and nuclear localization of the FOXO1 protein and increases its interaction with AR in 22Rv1 cells. A, paclitaxel elevates
FOXO1 protein level in 22Rv1 cells. 22Rv1 cells were treated with different concentrations of paclitaxel. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Cells were
lysed and whole-cell lysates (W.C.E.) were used for analysis of expression of FOXO1, Bim, and AR proteins by immunoblotting (IB). ERK2 was used as a loading
control. The number underneath each band in the immunoblot indicates the relative intensity of the corresponding band (the same analysis can be seen in B). B,
paclitaxel induces the accumulation of FOXO1 protein in the nucleus of 22Rv1 cells. 22Rv1 cells were treated with 1.0 nmol/L paclitaxel. At the indicated time points,
cells were harvested and nuclear fractions were then analyzed for expression of FOXO1 by immunoblotting. 14-3-3ζ and Sam68 were employed as markers for
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. C.E., cytosolic extraction; N.E., nuclear extraction. Ponceau S staining was used to monitor equal loading of
different nuclear extractions. C, paclitaxel increases the association of FOXO1 with AR proteins in the nucleus. 22Rv1 cells were treated with paclitaxel (1 nmol/L) for
24 h. Nuclear fractions were lysed and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with an anti-AR antibody or nonspecific IgG. Immunoprecipitants
were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against FOXO1 and AR. The relative intensity of the band for immunoprecipitated FOXO1 was first normalized with
the intensity of the AR band and then normalized against each other. For input FOXO1, the number underneath each band indicates the relative intensity of the
corresponding band. D, paclitaxel increases the association of FOXO1 with the PSA promoter. 22Rv1 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type FOXO1.
At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with paclitaxel and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was done. Top, representative ethidium bromide–stained

induces increased expression and nuclear localization of FOXO
proteins in breast and ovarian cancer cells (11–13) and (b) FOXO1
functions as a potent repressor of the AR in the nucleus (14). Treatment of 22Rv1 cells with 1 nmol/L paclitaxel resulted in a modest
but reproducible increase in FOXO1 protein as shown by Western
blot analysis with whole-cell lysates (Fig. 4A). FOXO1 expression
markedly increased in cells treated with a high dose (2.5 nmol/L)
of paclitaxel (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, expression of the proapoptotic
gene Bim, a transcriptional target of FOXO1, markedly increased
following paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 4A). Similar to the results seen

www.aacrjournals.org

in 22Rv1 cells treated with docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S1B), little or no change in the levels of AR proteins was detected in cells
treated with paclitaxel for 24 h (Fig. 4A). In contrast, treatment of
paclitaxel longer than 24 h resulted in a moderate decrease in AR
levels (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with the results observed from
animal studies (Fig. 3C). Further analysis showed that paclitaxel
promotes accumulation of the FOXO1 protein in the nucleus
(Fig. 4B). Because FOXO1 inhibition of the AR requires nuclear localization of FOXO1 (14) and this inhibition appears to be mediated by their interaction (21), we sought to determine whether

paclitaxel treatment increases the association between FOXO1 and
AR proteins in the nucleus. As shown by coimmunoprecipitation
assay, more FOXO1 proteins were detected in the AR complex in
paclitaxel-treated cells relative to the mock-treated cells (Fig. 4C).
Paclitaxel treatment failed to increase the interaction of AR proteins with the ectopically expressed nuclear form of FOXO1 (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that increased association of
FOXO1 with the AR is likely due to the increased expression and
nuclear localization of FOXO1 proteins induced by paclitaxel.
Moreover, consistent with a previous report (21), FOXO1 was detected on the promoter of the PSA gene in paclitaxel-untreated
cells as shown by both regular and real-time PCR (Fig. 4D). Importantly, more FOXO1 proteins were detected in the PSA promoter in
paclitaxel-treated cells in comparison with mock-treated cells
(Fig. 4D). Thus, paclitaxel treatment elevates the level of FOXO1
protein in the nucleus and increases the association of FOXO1 with
the AR protein and the PSA promoter in 22Rv1 cells.
Paclitaxel inhibition of the AR is mediated by FOXO1. Next,
we sought to determine whether paclitaxel-induced expression of
FOXO1 and FOXO1-AR association play a causal role in its inhibition
of the AR. The FOXO1 gene was knocked down by a FOXO1-specific
siRNA in 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 5A). As shown by real-time RT-PCR, paclitaxel-induced inhibition of PSA and Nkx3.1 expression was completely abolished in cells treated with the FOXO1-specific siRNA
(Fig. 5A). Although paclitaxel induced a significant reduction in
AR transcriptional activity in cells transfected nonspecific siRNA,
this effect was abrogated in cells transfected with FOXO1 siRNA
(Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that paclitaxel-induced inhibition
of AR activity is mediated by FOXO1. Consistently, paclitaxelinduced apoptosis of 22Rv1 cells was significantly diminished
by knockdown of endogenous FOXO1 (Fig. 5C). This result was
further confirmed by measuring the caspase-3 activity in 22Rv1 cells
treated with control or FOXO1-specific siRNA in the presence of
paclitaxel (Fig. 5D). Thus, FOXO1 not only contributes to paclitaxelinduced AR inhibition but also plays an important role in paclitaxelmediated apoptosis of CRPC cells.
AR-inhibitory effect of paclitaxel is suspended in PTENmutated C4-2 CRPC cells. We showed previously that FOXO1 inhibition of the AR requires the nuclear localization of FOXO1 (14).
It has been well established that loss of PTEN results in Akt activation, which leads to phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of FOXO proteins (22). Given that accumulation of the
FOXO1 protein in the nucleus is important for paclitaxel-induced
inhibition of the AR (Figs. 4 and 5), we hypothesized that inactivation of PTEN would abolish paclitaxel inhibition of the AR in prostate cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of
paclitaxel on PSA expression in PTEN-mutated LNCaP cells. Paclitaxel treatment failed to decrease PSA expression in this cell line
as shown by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4).
As shown in Fig. 6A (lane 1 versus lane 2), paclitaxel treatment
also failed to inhibit AR transcriptional activity in C4-2 cells, a
castration-resistant metastatic cell line that was originally derived from LNCaP cells through serial xenografting in castrated
mice (23). Similar to the previous report in Cos-7 cells (24), inhibition of Akt by treatment of C4-2 cells with the phosphoinositide 3kinase inhibitor LY294002 decreased AR transcriptional activity
(Fig. 6A). LY294002 inhibition of Akt was evident by loss of FOXO1
phosphorylation at serine 256 residue (Fig. 6A), a known Akt phosphorylation site (22). Importantly, paclitaxel treatment resulted in a
significant reduction in AR transcriptional activity in C4-2 cells pretreated with LY294002 in comparison with cells treated with

LY294002 alone (Fig. 6A). This effect was reversed by knockdown
of endogenous FOXO1 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, treatment of C4-2 cells
with paclitaxel alone failed to decrease the cell viability (Fig. 6B).
As expected, LY294002 treatment resulted in a marked inhibition

Figure 6. C4-2 cells are refractory to paclitaxel-induced inhibition of AR activity
and loss of cell viability. A, C4-2 cells were transfected with nonspecific siRNA
or FOXO1 siRNA in combination with 3×ARE-Luc and the Renilla luciferase
reporter gene. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 1 nmol/L
paclitaxel and/or LY294002. After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested for
measurement of luciferase activity. Protein expression was analyzed by
immunoblotting using antibodies against FOXO1, phospho-FOXO1 at S256
(FOXO1-S256-p), and AR. ERK2 was used as a loading control. B, C4-2 cells
were transfected with siRNAs and treated with paclitaxel and LY294002 as in

Taxol Inhibits AR Activity

of cell viability (Fig. 6B). Importantly, paclitaxel treatment also
significantly decreased the viability of C4-2 cells when they were
pretreated with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor and this
effect was largely diminished by FOXO1 knockdown (Fig. 6B). Together, these data suggest that deregulation of the PTEN/FOXO1
pathway may play an important role in development of Taxol resistance in CRPC.

Discussion
Taxol is the first chemotherapy agent that increases the survival
of patients with CRPC and hence has been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CRPC (1, 6–8).
In addition, the effectiveness of this chemotherapeutic agent is further manifested by at least 50% decline of serum PSA in half of the
CRPC patients (7). Although the Taxol-induced decline in PSA level
can be explained by the general effect of tumor regression, in the
present study, we identified the inhibition of AR activity as a novel
mechanism of Taxol chemotherapy in CRPC. We provide evidence
that both paclitaxel and docetaxel treatment resulted in a decrease
in expression of AR transactivated genes, including PSA and
Nkx3.1, in PTEN-positive 22Rv1 cells. The finding that expression
of the AR repression gene maspin markedly increased following
paclitaxel and docetaxel treatment further supports the conclusion
that decreased expression of AR transactivated genes is not solely
caused by Taxol-induced cell death but also through the inhibition
of AR transcriptional activity.
The finding from cell culture studies is further supported by observations in animals. Cell-based analysis in tumor tissues indicates that docetaxel treatment not only causes cell cycle arrest
at mitosis in tumor cells adjacent to blood vessels but also decreases PSA expression in similar cell populations. These findings
suggest that Taxol can also inhibit AR function under in vivo conditions. It is worth noting that the antitumor and anti-AR activities
of docetaxel were primarily detected in tumor cells immediately
next to vascular vessels. These findings suggest that the drug bioavailability may be a critical factor that needs to be considered for
better therapeutic effect of Taxol in vivo.
Our data further show that Taxol-induced inhibition of the AR is
mediated by the nuclear factor FOXO1. Similar to the findings in
breast and ovarian cancer cells (11–13), paclitaxel treatment induces increased expression and nuclear localization of FOXO1 in
22Rv1 CRPC cells. The molecular mechanism underlying Taxol-

induced expression of FOXO1 in these types of cancer cells is
unknown at present and further investigation is warranted. In
addition, this study shows that, following paclitaxel treatment, increased amounts of FOXO1 proteins were found to be associated
with the AR and the PSA promoter. As reported (14, 21, 25, 26),
FOXO1 functions as a potent repressor of the AR and this function
of FOXO1 requires nuclear localization of FOXO1 (14). Thus, it is
conceivable that treatment of CRPC cells with Taxol inhibits AR
activity by inducing nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 and increasing association of FOXO1 with the AR. In line with these findings,
we further unraveled that there was no inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on AR activity in PTEN-mutated androgen-dependent LNCaP
cell line and its androgen-refractory derivative C4-2. However, this
can be reversed by the pretreatment of cells with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Thus, our findings suggest that
the functional PTEN/FOXO1 pathway is an important factor in determining the anti-AR and antitumor efficacy of Taxol in prostate
cancer.
In summary, our studies show for the first time that Taxol inhibits the AR activity in CRPC cells in culture and in animals. Mechanistically, we show that the AR-inhibitory effect of Taxol is
mediated by accumulation of FOXO1 proteins in the nucleus and
increased interaction between FOXO1 and the AR. Given that the
tumor suppressor gene PTEN, a key upstream regulator of FOXO1,
is often mutated or deleted in advanced CRPC (27), deregulation of
the PTEN/FOXO1 pathway may play an important role in the development of Taxol resistance in prostate cancer.
