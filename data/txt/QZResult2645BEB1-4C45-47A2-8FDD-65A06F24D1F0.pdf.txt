Abstract
microRNA expression profiling plays an emerging role in cancer classification and identification of therapeutic
strategies. In this study, we have evaluated the benefits of a joint microRNA–mRNA analysis in breast cancer.
Matched mRNA and microRNA global expression profiling was conducted in a well-annotated cohort of 207
cases with complete 10-year follow-up. Penalized Cox regression including microRNA expression, mRNA
expression, and clinical covariates was used to identify microRNAs associated with distant relapse-free survival
(DRFS) that provide independent prognostic information, and are not simply surrogates of previously identified
prognostic covariates. Penalized regression was chosen to prevent overfitting. Furthermore, microRNA–mRNA
relationships were explored by global expression analysis, and exploited to validate results in several published
cohorts (n ¼ 592 with DRFS, n ¼ 1,050 with recurrence-free survival).
Four microRNAs were independently associated with DRFS in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (3 novel and 1
known; miR-128a) and 6 in ER-negative (5 novel and 1 known; miR-210) cases. Of the latter, miR-342, -27b, and
-150 were prognostic also in triple receptor-negative tumors. Coordinated expression of predicted target genes
and prognostic microRNAs strengthened these results, most significantly for miR-210, -128a, and -27b, whose
targets were prognostic in meta-analysis of several cohorts. In addition, miR-210 and -128a showed coordinated
expression with their cognate pri-microRNAs, which were themselves prognostic in independent cohorts.
Our integrated microRNA–mRNA global profiling approach has identified microRNAs independently associated with prognosis in breast cancer. Furthermore, it has validated known and predicted microRNA–target
interactions, and elucidated their association with key pathways that could represent novel therapeutic targets.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with treatment
resistance a consequence of pathologic and genomic characteristics. mRNA expression profiling in clinical cohorts has
led to identification of functional pathways with roles in
tumor progression and collections of genes (gene signatures)
associated with disease outcome (1), some of which are now
approved by Food and Drug Administration for clinical use,
such as MammaPrint and OncotypeDX.

microRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules regulating
cell function both at transcriptional and posttranscriptional
levels which open up a new area of prognostic marker research
complementary to established transcriptional gene signature
or traditional marker studies (2). A study by Blenkiron and
colleagues of 93 breast cancers identified several human
microRNAs associated with intrinsic breast cancer subtype
(3). Another recent study of 38 breast cancers (4) selected 12
microRNAs associated with clinicopathologic variables for
analysis in a cohort of 261 breast cancers. Among these, 4
(miR-7, -128a, -210, and -516-3p) were prognostic, miR-210
having been previously identified (5).
However, integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA
global expression profiles has yet to be explored in prognostic
studies. Such analyses have the potential not only to identify
microRNAs that are independent prognostic factors, but also
to elucidate microRNA function in vivo, and identify interactions between microRNAs and targeted mRNAs for enhanced
marker and therapeutic target discovery. Thus, we conducted
comprehensive microRNA and mRNA expression profiling
in a large, well-annotated cohort of 207 early-invasive breast
cancers.

prognostic covariates, a Cox regression for distant relapse-free
survival (DRFS) was carried out, including all microRNAs,
clinical covariates and gene signatures. Penalized least-square
minimization with variable selection and regularization was
used to prevent overfitting.
To investigate the functional role of prognostic microRNAs,
relationships between host genes (pri-microRNAs), mature
microRNAs, and cognate target mRNAs were examined by
global expression analysis. Finally, findings were confirmed by
2 further independent analyses. First, pri-microRNA (upstream
of microRNA expression) and genes in the microRNA processing
machinery were analyzed. In addition, expression of target
genes, reflecting the functional effect downstream of microRNA
expression, was considered. Prognostic significance of both
analyses was assessed in published cohorts (n > 1,000 cases).

Materials and Methods
Patient characteristics
A retrospective series of 219 patients with early primary
breast cancer was considered (5); extended demographics are
provided in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary
Information. Informed consent was obtained for each subject.
Clinical investigations were conducted after approval by the
local research ethics committee and in accordance with the
ethical principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Main endpoint was DRFS.
mRNA and microRNA profiling
Matched microRNA and mRNA profiling was successfully
obtained from 207 of 219 samples by using Illumina Human
RefSeq-8 and miRNAv1 arrays (see Supplementary Information). Data have been submitted to GEO (6), superSeries
GSE22220. In addition, Affymetrix U133A-B/plus2 array data
from previously published breast cancer cohorts were analyzed [Supplementary Table S2, n ¼ 1,050 with recurrence-free
survival (RFS), n ¼ 592 with RFS outcome].
Statistical methods
Workflow with study design is provided in Supplementary
Figure S1. Analyses were implemented and carried out in
R v2.9.0, and Sweave (7) was used for Automatic Generation of
Reports.
Penalized regression allows identification of microRNAs
whose expression is prognostic, or associated with a clinicopathologic factor, independently from other covariates. Genomic
datasets are characterized by a greater number of variables than
samples and high structure. Therefore, we used L1- and L2penalized regression to enable efficient variable selection and
encourage a grouping effect (8). Penalization parameters were
optimized by cross-validation, and leave-one-out was used to test
the models. Penalized Cox regression was carried out in 2 steps:
1. microRNAs associated with DRFS were selected by using
penalized Cox regression including all microRNAs on the
array [Supplementary Information, Equation (SM1)].
2. Selected microRNAs were analyzed further to assess
whether they were prognostic independently from

5636

known clinicopathologic factors. Covariates considered
were microRNA expression, clinical factors, treatment,
and gene signatures of biological processes [Supplementary Information, Equation (SM2)].
Only microRNAs selected by both steps were considered
independently prognostic of DRFS.
Penalized linear regression analysis was used to study
association of microRNA expression with clinicopathologic
factors [Supplementary Information, Equation (SM3)].
Meta-analysis of published cohorts was carried out as
previously described (9); datasets are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 and selection criteria are provided in
Supplementary Information.
Global expression analysis of microRNA–target
relationship
An extremely small number of microRNA targets have been
validated previously, thus analyses of microRNA–target relationship relies on in silico predictions. Simultaneous use of
multiple prediction algorithms has been suggested (10), and to
avoid bias resulting from underlying correlations we considered the union of all predicted targets from 6 major algorithms
(further details in Supplementary Information). We expected
that if a microRNA were functional, a significant proportion of
its predicted targets would be downregulated. Because of the
challenges involved, the following 3 methods were compared:
1. Cumulative relative risk (RR) plots. All transcripts present
on the array were ranked on the basis of the correlation of
their expression with that of the microRNA under study.
The RR was defined as the probability of observing, at each
correlation level, a given number of predicted targets
among genes whose expression is inversely correlated
with that of the microRNA, with respect to genes with
positive correlation [Supplementary Information, Equation (SM4)]. If targets are regulated by the microRNA, RR >
1. These plots were also used to study association of
microRNA targets with clinical factors [Supplementary
Information, Equations (SM5) and (SM6)].
2. Predicted target signature (PTSign) score. In each sample,
the inverse of the weighted average expression of all
predicted targets was calculated. Weights were the in
silico prediction scores [Supplementary Information,
Equation (SM7)].
3. Regulatory effect (RE) score. For each sample, transcripts
were ranked by their expression level. The difference of
the average rank between microRNA target and nontarget transcripts was calculated as described in (11).
High PTSign or RE scores indicate global target downregulation.

A 2-step Cox analysis accounting for clinical, pathologic,
and molecular features was used (Fig. 1; Supplementary
Fig. S2). Specifically, prognostic microRNAs were first selected

Integrated mRNA and microRNA Analysis in Breast Cancer

Figure 1. microRNAs independently prognostic of DRFS in breast cancer (n ¼ 207). Prognostic microRNAs were selected by 2-step penalized Cox regression
(see Materials and Methods). A–C, first a model including all microRNAs (x-axis) was considered (full results in Supplementary Fig. S2A). Heat maps display the
cross-validated model at each leave-one-out iteration (y-axis) for analyses in all 207 (A), 82 ER (B), and 90 ERþ Tamoxifen-treated (C) samples. Similar models
are clustered (standard correlation). Color reflects the HR (logged and rescaled per column, see bar). microRNAs that were selected in at least 5% of iterations
are shown. Consistently selected microRNAs (>95% iterations) were further analyzed by a Cox model including clinicopathologic factors and gene expression
signatures (D–G). microRNAs consistently significant in this model were considered prognostic and are indicated with an asterisk (red, not known; black,
previously known to be prognostic). Summary results are shown for ERþ Tamoxifen-treated (D) and ER (F) samples (full results in Supplementary Fig. S2C–E).
miR-768-3p is in parenthesis as it was retired from miRBase. Kaplan–Meier plots of prognostic microRNA signature in ERþ (E) and ER (G) cases are also
shown. Expression of each prognostic microRNA (asterisks from D and F, respectively) was ranked. In each case, the mean rank of poor prognosis microRNAs
was subtracted from that of good prognosis microRNAs to provide a nonparametric summary score. Cases were categorized as high and low risk by median
value of this score. Box plots of the microRNA ranked expression in the 2 groups show median, quartiles, and range.

in a penalized Cox analysis where all microRNAs were tested
simultaneously within the same model. Selected microRNAs
were then assessed to test prognostic capability independent
from clinical covariates [patient age, tumor size and grade,
nodal involvement, estrogen receptor (ER) status, Tamoxifen
and Chemotherapy treatment] and key biological processes as
measured by gene expression signatures derived from large
cancer cohort studies. Specifically, these were proliferation,
ESR1 and HER2 signaling (12, 13), hypoxia (9), stem cell (14),
invasion, immune response, and apoptosis (13).
This method identified 3 novel and 1 known (miR-128a)
prognostic microRNA in ERþ breast cancer, and 5 novel and
1 known (miR-210) in ER breast cancer (Fig. 1). Specifically,
high miR-767-3p, -128a, and/or -769-3p expression was
associated with poor prognosis, and high miR-135a with
good prognosis in ERþ cases; high miR-27b, -144, and/or -210
was associated with poor prognosis, and high miR-342, -150,
and/or -30c with good prognosis in ER cases. Full results
are reported in Supplementary Figure S2A–G. Three further
microRNAs, miR-29c, -642 (high values, good prognosis), and
-548d (high values, poor prognosis) were identified in an
analysis including all samples (Supplementary Fig. S2C). An
analysis including intrinsic subtype classification (Supplementary Table S1) produced similar results (data not
shown); however, because the stability of this classification
has been recently questioned (15) we have used the HER2/

www.aacrjournals.org

ER/proliferation signature classification for the main analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2C–E).
The above analysis confirmed 2 known prognostic microRNAs from previous studies (miR-210 and -128a); however,
miR-7 and -516-3p, also prognostic in a previous study (4),
could not be confirmed. In our study, miR-7 was associated
with DRFS in univariate Cox analysis but not in a model
including all microRNAs, suggesting that this microRNA is not
an independent prognostic factor, whereas miR-516-3p was
not significantly associated with DRFS.
Also, real-time PCR was carried out to measure expressions
of 4 prognostic microRNAs, miR-210, miR-342, miR-144 and
miR-27b, relative to 3 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) controls
(Supplementary Information). Strength of correlation between
real-time PCR and arrays results varied but was significant for
all 4 microRNAs (P < 0.0001 in all cases); analysis with nonnormalized CT values produced similar results (see Supplementary Information for discussion on PCR normalization).
microRNA signatures divided patients efficiently into good
and poor prognosis groups when either a simple median split
(Fig. 1E and G) or clustering with Bayesian Information
Criterion (Supplementary Fig. S2F) were considered, and
importantly they performed well when tested on the leftout cases (Supplementary Fig. S2B and G). Among microRNAs
prognostic in ER samples, 5 (miR-150, -342, good prognosis;
and miR-210, -144, -27b, poor prognosis) were also prognostic

Integrated mRNA and microRNA Analysis in Breast Cancer

Figure 2. Biological processes and clinicopathologic factors associated with prognostic microRNAs. Expression signatures derived from large-scale analysis
of cancer datasets were used as surrogate markers of biological processes; samples were ranked from lowest to highest as measured by summary scores of
these signatures. microRNAs prognostic in ERþ (A) and ER (B) cases are shown. Association between expression of each microRNA (y-axis) with
clinicopathologic variables and gene signatures (x-axis) was obtained by using penalized linear regression. Heat maps illustrate the microRNA association with
signature/clinical variable in the cross-validated model (see bar). Red, covariate levels high, microRNA expression high; blue, opposite. C, scatter plots with
examples of significant associations. MicroRNA expression (x-axis) and covariate (y-axis) are plotted with a second covariate shown as color stratification.
Linear fits and Spearman's rank correlation are shown in the 2 strata. HS up, Hypoxia Signature Score above median; HS down, below median; Nþ, nodal

in univariate analysis of triple negative (TRN) breast cancers
(n ¼ 37, see legend of Supplementary Table S1). miR-342, -27b,
and -150 were also significant in a Cox analysis of this group
including clinicopathologic factors and gene signatures (Supplementary Fig. S2H).
Otherindependent prognosticfactors werenumberof positive
nodes(SupplementaryFig.S2C–E)andtumorgrade(Supplementary Fig. S2C). In agreement with previous studies (9, 13), proliferation and hypoxia signatures were prognostic in ERþ cases
(Supplementary Fig. S2E); hypoxia, invasion, and immune
response signatures in ER cases (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Crucially, microRNAs identified by our analysis were prognosticallyindependentofthesesignatures(SupplementaryFig.S2C–E).
Prognostic microRNA clusters
miR-767-3p (prognostic in ERþ cases), and miR-27b and miR144 (prognostic in ER cases) are part of microRNA clusters.
Analysis of clustered microRNAs revealed that miR-451, clustered with miR-144, was significantly associated with good
prognosis in ERþ cases (Supplementary Table S3), suggesting
an independent role for these 2 clustered microRNAs in ERþ and
ER tumors. Conversely, the miR-24/27/23 cluster was consistently associated with poor prognosis, with all but one microRNA
of this family (miR-27a/b, -23a/b, -24; but not -189) significantly
associated with DRFS in univariate analysis of all cases, and all
microRNAs but one (miR-23b) significant in analysis of ER

cases (Supplementary Table S3). However, none of them was
associated with prognosis in ERþ cases, providing evidence that
this family plays a specific role in ER breast cancer.
Transcriptional regulation of microRNAs and analysis
of pri-microRNA in independent cohorts
We investigated whether prognostic microRNAs and their
pri-microRNAs showed coordinated expression, and studied
the prognostic potential of pri-microRNAs in independent
cohorts (n ¼ 1,050 with RFS, n ¼ 592 with DRFS information;
for further details on these cohorts see Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table S2). Initially, transcripts
containing pri-microRNA for 6 prognostic microRNAs could
be mapped to the arrays and their expression found to be
significantly correlated with that of the mature microRNA
in our series (Spearman's rank correlation test P < 0.05,
microRNAs are listed in Table 1). This suggests transcriptional
regulation of these microRNAs in breast cancer, rather than
modulation of the mature microRNA due to changes in
processing. Among these, pri-miR-128a, 210, -29c, -342, and
-548d showed significant association with prognosis in metaanalysis of the independent cohorts and a concordant effect
with respect to the microRNA prognostic analysis in Figure 1;
specifically, pri-miR-128a, -210, -342, and -548d were significant for DRFS, and -128a, -210, -27b, -342, and -548d were
significant for RFS (Table 1).

Association of prognostic microRNAs with processes
critical for breast cancer biology
microRNA association with clinicopathologic factors was
studied by multiple penalized linear regression (Fig. 2A and B).
This confirmed, for example, the previously reported hypoxia
regulation of miR-210 (Fig. 2C), but suggested that miR-210
expression is also associated with proliferation, ER positivity,
grade, and nodal invasion (Fig. 2B and C). Interestingly,
associations with hypoxia and proliferation were significant
after accounting for grade and ER status (Fig. 2B and C). This
highlights the usefulness of testing associations simultaneously by including clinical and molecular covariates in
the same regression model. miR-128a was found to be associated with ER positivity, both as measured by IHC and ESR1
expression signature (Fig. 2A). Among the newly discovered
prognostic microRNAs, a reported role for miR-150 in immunity (16) agrees with an association with immune response
signature in our dataset (Fig. 2C). miR-135a was inversely
correlated with the proliferation signature, in agreement with
reports of negative regulation of cell growth in Hodgkin's
lymphoma (17). Finally, miR-27b was associated with the
invasion signature (Fig. 2B), in agreement with its reported
ability to promote invasion and angiogenesis (18).
A recent study in 20 inflammatory breast cancers (IBC; ref.
19), one of the most aggressive forms of locally advanced
breast cancer, identified microRNAs belonging to families
miR-29 (-29a), -30 (-30b), and -342 as downregulated in IBC.
This agrees with our findings of expression of microRNAs in
these families (miR-29c, -30c, -342) being associated with good
prognosis. In the same study, miR-548a-5p was found upregulated in IBC, in agreement with high expression of the miR548 family being associated with poor prognosis (-548d).
Target expression is consistent with regulatory effect
of prognostic microRNAs
Downregulation of predicted target transcript was observed
by using cumulative RR plots for all prognostic microRNAs,
with miR-128a, -144, and -210 providing the most consistent
and significant results (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Furthermore, microRNA association with clinicopathologic
factors (Fig. 2) was reflected by coordinated downregulation
of cognate target mRNAs (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S3). The
most significant were miR-210 and -144 targets, strongly
underexpressed in highly proliferative tumors (Fig. 3). In 3
cases (miR-144, -210, and -769-3p), results could be confirmed
consistently by both PTsign- and RE-score methods (Supplementary Table S4); however, PTsign and RE scores were
strongly correlated for all microRNAs [P << 0.00001 for all
microRNAs, correlation coefficient range: (0.7–0.95)]. Contrary
to RR plots, these measure inhibition of target expression
irrespective of amount of downregulation.
A global analysis of microRNA targets reveals pathways
dysregulated in cancer
A pathway analysis revealed that a number of downregulated predicted targets, greater than that expected by
chance, were implicated in pathways which have important
roles in direct tumor growth and metastasis (Supplementary

would lead to induction of these pathways (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). For example, downregulated targets included
MAPK8 and MAPK14 ((miR-144 and miR-27b targets, respectively), which can be proapoptotic under stress conditions
(20); SPRY2 (miR-128a target) in the FGF receptor signaling
pathway, which has a major role in inhibiting tyrosine
kinases (21); and tumor suppressor genes PTEN and FOXO1
(miR-144 and -128a targets). miR-27b predicted targets in
the metabotropic glutamate receptor pathway, namely
GRIN3A, GRM6, and GRIA4, and voltage-dependent L-type
calcium channel subunit, were consistently downregulated.
Their association with neuronal cell death under hypoxic
stress (22) suggests a new potential mechanism by which
cancer cells escape death under stress. Recently, mutations
in this pathway were reported as the commonest mutations
in melanoma (23). Wnt antagonists such as miR-144 predicted target SRFP1, and targets involved in angiogenesis
such as Frizzled4 were also among downregulated predicted

targets, where excessive Frizzled4 has been associated with
disrupted embryonic vasculature (24).
In TRN cancers, several signaling pathways related with
miR-150 predicted targets were found upregulated in poor
prognosis cases including Akt2, insulin receptor, ErbB3, S6
kinase, MAP kinase pathways, and stress response kinase JNK,
as well as downstream protease MMP-13 (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). miR-342 predicted target RRM2 was also upregulated
in this group (Supplementary Fig. S4B). RRM2 is a target for
several inhibitors of proliferation that affect cells in S-phase,
and would be compatible with the high proliferation rate of
TRN cancer (6). Similar pattern was observed for miR-342
target glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthase, a critical component
of glycolysis (25) to which inhibitors are currently being
developed; and TLE-1, a downstream component of notch
signaling (26), that is already recognized to be activated in
TRN cancers.

Validation of prognostic microRNAs using target
expression in the present and independent cohorts
We focused on prognostic microRNAs showing consistent and significant association with downregulation of
cognate target transcripts. Among these, miR-210, -128,
and -27b predicted targets were prognostic for DRFS
and RFS, both when using cumulative RR (Supplementary
Fig. S5) and summary scores in meta-analysis of published
cohort studies (Fig. 4A–F). Furthermore, tumors with concomitant microRNA overexpression and target underexpression had significantly worse prognosis, whereas the
opposite was true for cases with low microRNA levels and
high target expression (Fig. 4G–I).
We also conducted a single target analysis for experimentally derived miR-210 targets (Supplementary Fig. S4E). Three
of 5 targets showing most significant downregulation, namely
ISCU, CBX7, and IGF1R, were significantly associated with

DRFS; specifically, low levels were associated with poor prognosis (Supplementary Fig. S4E). This suggests that novel targets
can be confirmed with this approach. To further assess this
potential we assessed protein expression by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for a predicted target with suitable
commercial antibody available. NFE2L2 (alias NRF2) was
chosen as top ranking downregulated predicted target of
miR-144, novel prognostic microRNAs showing evidence of
coordinated downregulation of target mRNAs (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S4). IHC was done on 137 cases (Supplementary
Information); staining was predominantly cytoplasmic with
minimal stromal positivity (Supplementary Fig. S6). Tumors
with weak protein and mRNA expression showed significantly
higher miR-144 expression than tumors with consistently high
NFE2L2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S6). This was true only
in ER cases (Supplementary Fig. S6D and E), miR-144 being
prognostic only in ER tumors (Fig. 1) in agreement. Low
NFE2L2 IHC product score (IPS) was associated with worse
DRFS (univariate Cox HR ¼ 0.64, P ¼ 0.18; IPS ranked and
normalized between 0 and 1); in agreement with NFE2L2 acting
as a tumor suppressor (23). Furthermore, tumors with concomitant miR-144 overexpression and NFE2L2 underexpression had significantly worse prognosis, whereas the opposite
was true for cases with low miR-144 levels and high NFE2L2
expression (Supplementary Fig. S6F).
microRNAs are prognostic independent of expression
of microRNA-processing genes
We found that the expression of some, but not all, primicroRNAs was correlated with that of the mature micro-

RNAs. Thus, we investigated whether microRNA-processing
genes might have a role in regulation of mature microRNA
levels. We tested the prognostic significance of several
processing genes. High expression of transport gene exportin 5 (XPO5) and RISC complex genes EIF2C2 and EIF2C3
were significantly associated with poor prognosis, whereas
high expression of DICER genes DICER1 and TARBP1, and
RISC complex gene EIF2C4 were associated with good
prognosis (Table 2). Of these, expression of XPO5 showed
a significant correlation with mature microRNA expression
both for the ER and ERþ microRNA prognostic signatures
(Fig. 5A and B), whereas EIF2C2 and EIF2C3 showed correlation only with the ER microRNA prognostic signature.
However, in all cases fold expression changes were very
small (Fig. 5A and B). When samples were stratified by low
and high risk, based on microRNA signature and expression
of processing genes, the effect of the latter was never
significant (Fig. 5C–F). A Cox analysis including single
prognostic microRNAs and processing genes showed that
in all cases, mature microRNA expression was significantly
independent of the expression of the processing genes
(Supplementary Table S5). Overall, these results suggest
that the expression profile and prognostic significance of
these microRNAs is due to regulation of their transcription
rather than differential processing. For miR-128a, -210, -342,
and -548d, this is also confirmed by the prognostic significance of their pri-microRNA expression in independent
cohorts (Table 1).
Interestingly, EIF2C2 (AGO2) expression in our samples,
although mildly differential, was always very high (Fig. 5),

thus allowing mature microRNAs to modulate target gene
expression. This is particularly important in view of recent
work (11) suggesting that AGO expression is mandatory for
an effect of microRNAs on the expression profiles of tumor
samples.

Discussion
In this study, microRNAs that are independently prognostic
for DRFS were identified and validated by integrated analysis
of microRNA and mRNA profiling. Nine microRNAs were
found prognostic in ERþ and ER breast cancer, 3 of which
remained significant in the clinically challenging TRN group.
Our findings regarding mature miR-210 and miR-128a expression confirm previous findings of a smaller study (4). Multiple
penalized linear regression revealed that prognostic microRNAs are associated with key biological processes in
breast cancer, such as proliferation (miR-135a), hypoxia

www.aacrjournals.org

(miR-210, -342), invasion (miR-27b), and immune response
(miR-150). However, these microRNAs are prognostic independent of gene expression signatures of these processes. This
highlights the importance of considering both microRNA and
transcript expression data in prognostic studies.
Several microRNAs previously linked with breast cancer
subtype or progression in experimental models were not
identified as independently prognostic. This agrees with previous results from prognostic studies (4, 27); reasons could
include discrepancy of assays and/or the importance of
microRNA expression in specific cell populations which would
not appear in whole tumor sample analyses. However, it also
highlights the need to differentiate between biomarkers of
tumor presence and prognostic biomarkers, and identify
factors carrying information independently rather than surrogates of known prognostic covariates.
To examine whether microRNAs might be prognostic due
to regulatory effects on cognate targets, associations between

microRNAs and predicted targets were studied by global
expression analysis. This is challenging, as the microRNA–
mRNA interaction network is complex and the effect on each
individual mRNA is often small. Nevertheless, prognostic miR128a, -27b, and -210 showed evidence of cognate target downregulation, and expression of their targets was prognostic in
meta-analysis of several cohorts (Fig. 4). Furthermore, combined use of microRNA and target expression identified cases
with the poorest prognosis, suggesting that a combined score
could reflect not only expression but also functionality of the
microRNA.
Prognostic microRNAs could be used not only to select
patients for specific interventions, but also to define therapeutic approaches. To this end, functional validation of
microRNA targets is needed to elucidate the role of microRNAs in cancer. In this respect, analysis of microRNA–
mRNA relationships in clinical datasets could assist in target
prioritization, and cohorts such as the present one will be a
useful resource for future validation studies. Prognostic
microRNAs were found to regulate a wide range of previously poorly investigated pathways that may be related to
cancer progression and potential candidates for therapy,
such as RRM2 and TLE-1 in TRN breast cancers. A validated
example was miR-210 target ISCU (iron-sulfur cluster scaffold homolog), which was downregulated in samples with
high miR-210 levels, and whose underexpression was associated with both hypoxia and poor prognosis. ISCU plays an
important role in mitochondrial respiration and DNA repair
(28, 29). Tumors with high miR-210 might be for example
more susceptible to DNA damaging agents combined
with DNA repair inhibitors. Importantly, ISCU could not
be identified in traditional supervised gene expression prognostic analyses.
An additional benefit of merging microRNA and mRNA data
was that coordinate expression of microRNAs and precursorcontaining pri-microRNAs, and expression of microRNA-processing genes could be explored. As this analysis suggested
that several prognostic microRNAs are regulated at the tran-

scriptional level rather than through changes in RNA processing mechanisms (Fig. 5), pri-microRNA data (Table 1) could
be used for the validation of our findings in cohorts for which
only mRNA profiling is available. The most striking results
were for miR-210 and -128a, where coordinated expression of
pri-microRNA (upstream of microRNA expression), mature
microRNA and predicted targets was observed. Expression of
each one of these components was found to be prognostic.
In conclusion, this is the first large study integrating microRNA and mRNA global profiles in human breast cancer. Prognostic microRNAs in ERþ and ER breast cancer were
identified, and regulatory action on target transcripts shown.
These results elucidated potential novel therapeutic targets,
and could also be exploited to validate findings in independent
cohorts. Our approach consistently validated known microRNA–target interactions, and may therefore be broadly applicable to other biologically and clinically heterogeneous diseases.
