Abstract
The effects of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA/VEGF) and its receptors on endothelial cells function have
been studied extensively, but their effects on tumor cells
are less well deÔ¨Åned. Studies of human colorectal cancer
cells where the VEGF gene has been deleted suggest an
intracellular role of VEGF as a cell survival factor. In this
study, we investigated the role of intracrine VEGF signaling
in colorectal cancer cell survival. In human colorectal cancer
cells, RNAi-mediated depletion of VEGF decreased cell survival and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy. Unbiased
reverse phase protein array studies and subsequent validation experiments indicated that impaired cell survival was

a consequence of disrupted AKT and ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1)
signaling, as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation. Inhibition of paracrine or autocrine VEGF signaling had no
effect on phospho-AKT or phospho-ERK1/2 levels, indicating that VEGF mediates cell survival via an intracellular mechanism. Notably, RNAi-mediated depletion of
VEGF receptor VEGFR1/FLT1 replicated the effects of VEGF
depletion on phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK1/2 levels.
Together, these studies show how VEGF functions as an
intracrine survival factor in colorectal cancer cells, demonstrating its distinct role in colorectal cancer cell survival.

Introduction

contrary to early expectations, these therapeutic approaches
have led to only modest patient beneÔ¨Åt, with rare exceptions,
such as therapy for renal cell carcinoma (6).Thus, it is essential
to enhance our understanding of the role of VEGF in tumor
biology to improve upon current therapies targeting this
essential protein.
Although VEGF and its receptors have been well characterized on endothelial cells, the roles of VEGF and its receptors
in tumor cells are poorly understood. Our previous studies
demonstrated the presence and function of VEGFRs in and on
human colorectal cancer cells (7‚Äì10). Others (11) have
shown that an intracellular VEGF axis might function in
breast cancer cells to mediate cell survival. Prior studies from
our laboratory have demonstrated that VEGF functions as a
prosurvival factor in colorectal cancer cells and has a novel
intracrine role that is distinct from its canonical paracrine or
autocrine roles in angiogenesis (12). A better understanding
of intracrine VEGF signaling is required to determine if
targeting intracellular VEGF could be more effective than
current methods that target the function of extracellular VEGF
on membrane-bound VEGFRs.
In the present study, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of intracrine VEGF signaling in mediating colorectal cancer cell survival. Our Ô¨Åndings clearly demonstrate that the depletion of intracellular VEGF decreases the
activation of multiple signaling proteins that act as prosurvival
or proliferation factors and that these effects are modulated by
the activity of a VEGF-regulated tyrosine phosphatase. These
Ô¨Åndings provide mechanistic evidence for a novel and previously unidentiÔ¨Åed intracellular role of VEGF and support a
paradigm shift in our understanding of VEGF's role in intracrine-mediated cancer cell survival.

The VEGF family of ligands (VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D) and the
placenta growth factor are key mediators of tumor angiogenesis.
Interactions of these factors with three tyrosine kinase receptors
(VEGFR-1, -2, and -3) and two coreceptors [neuropilin (NRP)-1
and -2] have all been well characterized on endothelial cells (1,
2). The role of VEGF in vascular development is best demonstrated by the fact that heterozygous deletion of VEGF is
embryonic lethal, primarily due to impaired formation of
vascular structures (3, 4). VEGF-targeted therapies are used
to treat a variety of cancers, including colorectal cancer, renal
cell carcinoma, non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and glioblastoma. At present, all FDAapproved antiangiogenic therapies use antibodies/traps to
inhibit VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR interactions or by inhibiting the activity
of the VEGFRs. These approaches were developed based on the
premise that VEGF-VEGFR signaling occurs in either a paracrine or autocrine fashion on endothelial cells (5). However,

Intracrine VEGF Mediates Survival Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Cells

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116, SW480, and HT29
(from ATCC) and HCP-1 (generated in our laboratory as
described previously; ref. 13), were cultured as described previously (12, 13). All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem
repeat analyses at the Characterized Cell Line Core facility at MD
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) at the start and during the
study.
Reagents
Reagents used were Recombinant human VEGF-A165 (R&D
Systems, Inc.), VEGFR-1 antibody (18F1; ImClone Systems),
SU5416 (Sigma-Aldrich), pazopanib (Selleck chemicals), Bevacizumab (Bev), and Ô¨Çuorouracil (5FU; MDACC pharmacy).
Western blotting
Western blotting experiments were performed as described in
ref. 12. All cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Approximately 50 to 100 mg proteins were analyzed to get
clearly visible bands. All antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Data.
MTT assay
In vitro cell growth was assessed using a MTT assay (Sigma).
BrieÔ¨Çy, colorectal cancer cells were transfected with the required
siRNAs for 24 hours and then replated into 96-well plates at 3,000
cells per well in 200 mL media. The cells were further incubated for
72 hours with or without Ô¨Çuorouracil (1 mg/mL for HT29 cells; 2
mg/mL for HCT116 and SW480 cells) followed by MTT assays
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
siRNA knockdown
VEGF was depleted in colorectal cancer cells using a mixture of
three different siRNAs targeting all isoforms of human VEGF.
Similarly, VEGFR1 was depleted by a mixture of two siRNAs
targeting the N-terminus of VEGFR1 mRNA. (All siRNA sequences
are in Supplementary Data.) A validated nontargeting siRNA
(control siRNA) was obtained from Sigma. The siRNA knockdown was performed in regular cell culture medium containing
10% FBS without antibiotics using the Lipofectamine 2000 siRNA
transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured with Minimal
Essential Media supplemented with 1% FBS and antibiotics.
Forty-eight hours later, supernatant media were collected and
assayed for VEGF depletion, or cells were lysed and lysates were
used to assay for levels of different proteins and in reverse phase
protein array (RPPA) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) arrays.
RPPA analyses
RPPA analyses were performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center's Functional Proteomics RPPA Core facility. BrieÔ¨Çy, serial
dilutions of cell lysates were prepared following requisite treatments of colorectal cancer cells and arrayed on nitrocellulosecoated slides. Heatmaps were generated in Cluster 3.0 (http://
www.eisenlab.org/eisen/) as a hierarchical cluster using Pearson
correlation and a center metric.

www.aacrjournals.org

RTK arrays
Changes in various RTKs were assayed using the Human
Phospho-RTK Array Kit (R&D Systems), which can unbiasedly
measure changes in a panel of about 50 RTKs. BrieÔ¨Çy, colorectal
cancer cell lysates were incubated with the membranes from the
RTK array Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The
membranes were then washed and treated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 2 hours, and the reacting protein signals
were detected by exposing the membranes to autoradiography
Ô¨Ålms using chemiluminescence substrates. Multiple exposures
were taken and analyzed for changes in phospho-RTK levels.
Immunoprecipitation
Colorectal cancer cells stably expressing Myc-tagged VEGF165
were transiently transfected with empty vector or a plasmid
expressing FLAG-tagged VEGFR1. After 48 hours, cell lysates were
prepared and were incubated with either EZ View Red anti-FLAG
Gel or EZ View Red anti-Myc Gel (Sigma) for 14 to 16 hours at
4 C. Following three washes with RIPA buffer, the bound proteins
were eluted by boiling the lysates in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.
The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.
Phosphatase treatments
Colorectal cancer cells were transfected with VEGF-targeting
siRNAs; 16 hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by
MEM with 1% FBS and antibiotics, and the cells were further
incubated for approximately 30 hours. Then, the cells were treated
with either 4 nmol/L okadaic acid or 100 mmol/L Na3VO4 for
approximately 16 hours. The cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and examined for levels
of various phospho-proteins. Untreated and control siRNA‚Äìtransfected cells were used as controls.
Treatment with antiangiogenic agents or recombinant VEGF
Colorectal cancer cells were treated with bevacizumab
(250 mg/mL; ref. 12), pazopanib (10 nmol/L; ref. 14), SU5416
(10 mmol/L; ref. 15), and 18F1 (20 mg/mL; ref. 8) for 14 to 16
hours and lysed to measure levels of various proteins. Cells
grown in media containing 1% FBS were also treated with 20
ng/mL of recombinant VEGF for 5 to 30 minutes as required
and assayed for alterations in signaling proteins.
Image analyses
Autoradiographs of Western blots were scanned, and the resulting TIFF images were analyzed using the ImageJ software program
(http://imagej.nih.gov/ij). Band intensities were determined after
subtracting background and selecting and plotting lanes for the
required bands using the "Analyze" option. For measuring "spot"
intensities in the RTK array, the "Oval" selection macro was used
to draw circles large enough to cover the spots and measure their
intensities. Intensities of areas without antigen reaction on the
same scanned images using same-sized circles were measured as
background and subtracted from all intensity measurements.
ImmunoÔ¨Çuorescence
BrieÔ¨Çy, colorectal cancer cells were grown on chamber slides
and Ô¨Åxed with 2% PFA in PBS. Following permeabilization in PBS
with 1% Tween 20 and 3X washes with TBST, slides were blocked
in 8% Ô¨Åsh gelatin in TBST (blocking buffer). After 3X washes in
TBST, slides were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted

in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were
then washed again as above and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature.
Stained cells were then visualized using a confocal microscope
with a 60 oil objective, and images were taken with a CCD
camera. DNA was visualized by staining with DAPI.
Graphical and statistical analyses
All graphical calculations and numerical data plotting were
performed using Excel (Microsoft). All data are expressed as mean
 standard errors. The statistical signiÔ¨Åcance of differences
between different experimental groups was determined by the
Student t test, and P values less than 0.05 were considered
signiÔ¨Åcant.

Results
VEGF depletion in colorectal cancer cells reduces cell survival
and enhances chemosensitivity
In our previous studies, we investigated the effects of VEGF
signaling in colorectal cancer cells by studying different colorectal
cancer cells with homozygous deletion of VEGF genes (12).
However, the effects of this depletion were subject to possible
alterations in compensatory pathways, as is observed frequently
in most studies involving the deletion of important genes. In the
present study, therefore, to assess the effects on colorectal cancer
cells that were truly due to VEGF depletion alone, we performed
all experiments with VEGF-depleted cells soon after VEGF knockdown with siRNA (i.e., 72 to 96 hours following transfection). We
initially designed three different siRNAs that target all VEGF
isoforms; the combination of these three siRNAs appeared to
elicit a stronger reduction of VEGF in multiple colorectal cancer
cells than any of the three siRNAs individually (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Transfection with this siRNA mixture led to strong and
consistent decreases in the levels of all VEGF isoforms in different
colorectal cancer cell lines, whereas transfection with a validated
nontargeting control siRNA did not (Fig. 1A). HCT116, SW480,
and HT29 colorectal cancer cells with siRNA-induced VEGF
depletion had reduced proliferation (Fig. 1B) and increased
apoptosis (Fig. 1C) compared with controls. 5FU treatment
increased apoptosis in all colorectal cancer cell lines. However,
VEGF depletion increased the cytotoxicity of 5FU compared with
5FU treatment alone (Fig. 1B and C). Bevacizumab treatment to
inhibit paracrine/autocrine signaling did not reduce cell growth or
alter chemosensitivity in the same colorectal cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). The effects of this acute VEGF depletion in
colorectal cancer cells (i.e., reduced survival and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy) were similar to those observed in colorectal cancer cells with somatic VEGF knockout, as described
previously (12). These observations clearly indicate that VEGF is
an intracrine/intracellular survival factor in colorectal cancer cells.

full-length proteins did on the same blot, equal proteins were loaded in two
different gels and assayed for either full-length or cleaved proteins
with their speciÔ¨Åc antibodies. One representative a-tubulin blot (loading
control) is shown.

VEGF depletion reduces the activity of cell survival molecules
To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which VEGF
depletion affects colorectal cancer cell survival, we used an unbiased approach to identify alterations in signaling molecules that
are important to cell survival. Screening HCT116 cells by RPPA,
which detects changes in approximately 150 signaling proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S3A), identiÔ¨Åed AKT and ERK1/2 as having
measurable decreases in their phosphorylation levels in response
to acute VEGF depletion (Fig. 2A). The decrease in AKT phos-

phorylation (50%) was of greater magnitude (2 fold) compared with twice that in phospho-ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(25% decrease; Fig. 2A). These preliminary screening results
were veriÔ¨Åed in HCT116, SW480, and HT29 colorectal cancer cell
lines; all cell lines studied demonstrated a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in
pAKT Ser473, as well as decreases in pERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204 in
response to VEGF depletion (Fig. 2B). [Note: Although we found
pERK1/2 levels were diminished with VEGF depletion in multiple

experiments (Fig. 2B), the effects were not as robust as for pAKT
in all experiments. Thus, we assume that the effects on cell growth
are most likely due to changes in pAKT levels with smaller
contributions from pERK1/2.] Similar effects were observed in
other colorectal cancer cell lines, including CaCo2, RKO, and
HCP1 [a cell line newly isolated in our laboratory (13)] following
VEGF depletion by siRNA treatment (data not shown), indicating
a common VEGF-mediated regulation of prosurvival signaling in
colorectal cancer cell lines.
The initial RPPA analysis of HCT116 cells also demonstrated
alterations in the phosphorylation levels of PRAS40 and 70S6K,
which are downstream of the AKT pathway (Supplementary Fig
S3). To validate the effects of VEGF depletion on AKT signaling, we
assessed representative downstream molecules in the AKT signaling pathway that are involved in apoptosis and proliferation. We
found signiÔ¨Åcant reductions in phosphorylation levels of BAD,
PRAS40, and 70S6K in HCT116 and SW480 cell lines following
VEGF depletion, whereas such reductions were minimal in HT29
cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that the effects of VEGF on colorectal
cancer cell survival are mediated mostly through the prosurvival
molecule AKT.
VEGF regulates AKT by an intracellular mechanism
To deÔ¨Ånitively determine whether the effects of VEGF depletion
on AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation occur through a novel
intracellular activity of VEGF, rather than through the paracrine/autocrine signaling described in endothelial cells, we treated
colorectal cancer cells with bevacizumab, an antibody that inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors on the cell surface (1). The
pAKT and pERK1/2 levels of the bevacizumab-treated colorectal
cancer cells were no different from those of the untreated colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 3A). This indicated that the inhibition of
extracellular VEGF-VEGFR1/R2 binding did not correlate to the
effects of VEGF depletion that were most likely due to intracellular
events.
Others have reported that bevacizumab does not inhibit VEGFNRP1/2 binding (16, 17). Thus, VEGF depletion may affect
colorectal cancer cell survival through a VEGF-NRP signaling
cascade that is perturbed in the absence of VEGF but not affected
by bevacizumab. To test this possibility, we incubated colorectal
cancer cells treated with VEGF siRNAs in the presence of recombinant VEGF, which can bind to NRP1/2 on the colorectal cancer
cell surface, and assessed the cells for rescue of pAKT levels. Adding
recombinant VEGF to the cell culture media failed to increase the
cells' levels of pAKT (Fig. 3B), clearly demonstrating that VEGF
exerts its effects on various signaling molecules through a novel
intracellular mechanism. Control siRNA‚Äìtreated colorectal cancer
cells exposed to recombinant VEGF also failed to demonstrate any
signiÔ¨Åcant increase in pAKT or pERK1/2 (Fig. 3B) levels, suggesting that VEGF, as a paracrine factor, has limited effects on these
cells.
VEGFR1 depletion reduces pAKT levels in colorectal cancer cells
Most of VEGF's known effects are mediated through its binding
to its receptors or coreceptors on cell membranes (1, 2, 18).
Because the effects of VEGF depletion on prosurvival molecules
appeared to be independent of cell membrane VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR/
NRP interactions, we sought to determine whether the intracellular signaling of VEGF required its interaction with intracellular
VEGFRs. Indeed, depleting VEGFR1 in HCT116 cells decreased
pAKT and pERK1/2 levels (Fig. 4A). We also found signiÔ¨Åcant

studies have also demonstrated a complex pseudogene-mediated

that were very similar to the effects of VEGF depletion. As
expected, inhibiting VEGF-VEGFR1 binding on cell membranes
with bevacizumab or a VEGFR1-binding antibody (18F1) did not
alter pAKT or pERK1/2 levels compared with those in untreated
control colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, inhibition
of the kinase function of VEGFR1 by pazopanib or SU5416 also
had no effect on pAKT or pERK1/2 levels (Fig. 4C). [All the
reagents were tested for efÔ¨Åcacy by measuring their effects on
VEGFR1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4).] Together,
these data indicate that intracellular VEGFR1 plays an important
role in the intracellular VEGF-mediated regulation of pAKT and
pERK1/2 that is independent of its kinase activity. Similar results
were also obtained in experiments with SW480 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). VEGFR1 is alternately spliced to produce a
secreted version of VEGFR1, soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1; ref. 19),
that lacks both of the membrane binding and kinase domains, but
has very strong binding afÔ¨Ånity for VEGF. To determine if colorectal cancer cells expressed sVEGFR1 and if this protein could
possibly form a complex with VEGF intracellularly, we analyzed
cell lysates from different colorectal cancer cells for the presence of

Intracrine VEGF Mediates Survival Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Cells

expression, but does not modify its function, effects of the
VEGFR1 pseudogene on VEGF/VEGFR1 intracrine signaling
were not further studied. Since our previous studies showed that
colorectal cancer cells express very low to nondetectable levels of
VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 (8, 12), VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR2 and VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR3
interactions were not investigated in the present study.
VEGF and VEGFR1 interact intracellularly
To determine whether VEGF and VEGFR1 interact to form a
receptor‚Äìligand complex, we performed coimmunoprecipitation
experiments. As most antibodies against VEGF or VEGFR1 are
weak, have bindings sites possibly hindering VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR interactions, and have cross-reactivity to other proteins, as is observed
in Western blots, these experiments were performed with epitopetagged recombinant proteins. HCT116 cells stably expressing
Myc-tagged VEGF165 (Myc-VEGF) were transiently transfected
with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged VEGFR1 (FLAG-VEGFR1).
Empty vector‚Äìtransfected HCT116 cells expressing Myc-VEGF and
FLAG-VEGFR1‚Äìtransfected HCT116 cells not expressing MycVEGF were used as controls. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that VEGFR1 and VEGF interact and form a complex in
colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S7). To
determine whether this interaction was intracellular, rather than
occurring on the cell membrane, we performed similar coimmunoprecipitation experiments with and without bevacizumab.
FLAG-VEGFR1 coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-VEGF in both
untreated HCT116 cells and HCT116 cells treated with bevacizumab for extended periods (16 hours; Fig. 4D). As prolonged
bevacizumab treatment should inhibit any VEGF-VEGFR1 binding at the cell surface, these observations strongly support the
formation of an intracellular VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR1 complex.
We also performed immunostaining of colorectal cancer
cells to visualize intracellular localization of VEGF and VEGFR1
(Fig. 5). Using antibodies speciÔ¨Åc to VEGF (rabbit polyclonal),
VEGFR1 (mouse monoclonal), and Lamin B (goat polyclonal),
we performed confocal microscopy and obtained images.
Both VEGF and VEGFR1 were observed in the cytoplasm and
also on the nuclear membrane (Fig. 5). Some intranuclear
localization of both proteins was also observed (Fig. 5). These
observations are consistent with our studies that indicate the
presence of both VEGF and VEGFR1 in both cytoplasm and the
nucleus by Western blotting of fractionated protein extracts
(data not shown). The strongest colocalization of VEGF and
VEGFR1 was observed on and near the nuclear membrane,
although cytoplasmic colocalization was also observed.
We used a different set of antibodies (bevacizumab: anti-VEGF,
rabbit polyclonal anti-VEGFR1 and goat polyclonal anti-Lamin
B) to perform similar immunostaining and found very
similar results (Supplementary Fig. S8), thus validating our
observations.
A tyrosine phosphatase mediates VEGF's regulation of pAKT
and pERK1/2
Activation of AKT through a VEGF-VEGFR1 signaling pathway in hepatic stellate cells (21) or through VEGF-VEGFR2
signaling in endothelial cells (22) has been reported previously.
These signaling events are initiated through ligand‚Äìreceptor
interactions on the cell membrane. However, we sought to
identify the mechanism by which intracellular VEGF signaling
regulates AKT phosphorylation. There are two possible
mechanisms that explain reduced pAKT levels in colorectal

www.aacrjournals.org

cancer cells with VEGF depletion: (i) the activation of a
VEGF-regulated phosphatase causes pAKT to be dephosphorylated at a higher rate, and (ii) the VEGF-mediated regulation of
upstream signaling factors inhibits AKT phosphorylation
(shown pictorially in Supplementary Fig. S9). To identify the
mechanism by which VEGF regulates AKT phosphorylation, we
incubated colorectal cancer cells treated with VEGF siRNAs in
the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and assayed for rescued
pAKT levels. Inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatases by
okadaic acid did not rescue pAKT levels in VEGF-depleted cells
to the levels in cells with normal VEGF (Fig. 6). However,
treating VEGF-depleted cells with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, Na3VO4, rescued pAKT levels to similar or higher than that
observed in cells with normal levels of VEGF (Fig. 6). pERK1/2
levels appeared to be rescued by both the serine/threonine
phosphatase inhibitor and the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor
(Fig. 6). Because a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and not a
serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor rescued AKT phosphorylation at the serine 473 residue, it clearly indicates that the
VEGF-mediated activation of a serine/threonine phosphatase
is not responsible for decreased pAKT. However, this Ô¨Ånding
did raise the possibility that pAKT levels may be regulated by
the inactivation of upstream signaling molecules, e.g., RTKs,
which can in turn be regulated by the activity of tyrosine
phosphatases.
VEGF depletion affects the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs
Tumor cells express a variety of RTKs on their cell surface. It is
possible that VEGF-mediated regulation of one or multiple RTKs
can lead to altered pAKT levels in colorectal cancer cells. We took
an unbiased approach to determine whether VEGF depletion
inactivates single or multiple RTKs in colorectal cancer cells.
Protein lysates from colorectal cancer cells treated with control
siRNA and VEGF siRNA were analyzed on a human phospho-RTK
array that enables detection of the phosphorylation status of
approximately 50 phospho-RTKs. The phosphorylation levels
of multiple RTKs in VEGF siRNA‚Äìtreated HCT116 cells were
signiÔ¨Åcantly different from those in control siRNA‚Äìtreated cells
(Fig. 7A and B). Reduced phosphorylation in EGFR, c-MET, MSPR, IR, c-RET, AXL, and DTK receptors was observed in the VEGFdepleted HCT116 cells (Fig. 7A and B). Similar effects were
observed in SW480 cells, which had lower levels of phosphorylated EGFR, IR, and DTK (Supplementary Fig. S10). Alterations in
a variety of RTKs in colorectal cancer cells indicated that VEGF
depletion has a broad and signiÔ¨Åcant effect on cell signaling. We
further validated these observations by measuring the levels of
phosphorylated EGFR and c-MET individually in HCT116 cells
treated with either control siRNA or VEGF siRNA (Fig. 7C; Supplementary Fig. S10). To further validate our hypothesis that
VEGF depletion enhances the activity of one or more tyrosine
phosphatases, we treated colorectal cancer cells with Na3VO4 and
assayed for rescue of pEGFR and pc-MET levels (Fig. 6C). If VEGF
depletion inhibited RTK phosphorylation, Na3VO4 treatment
would not signiÔ¨Åcantly increase phosphorylated RTK levels. However, if phosphorylation of RTKs is not affected, but VEGF depletion enhances phosphatase activity, Na3VO4 treatment would
easily rescue phosphorylated RTKs to normal or higher than
normal levels. Na3VO4 treatment signiÔ¨Åcantly increased pEGFR
and pc-MET levels in VEGF-depleted cells, supporting a mechanism involving a VEGF-mediated phosphatase (Fig. 7C). Similar
results were also obtained for SW480 cells (Supplementary

Overexpression of RTKs rescues reduced pAKT levels in

Overexpression of RTKs could possibly rescue the effects of
increased phosphatase activity in VEGF-depleted colorectal cancer
cells. To test this hypothesis, HCT116 and SW480 cells were
doubly transfected with VEGF siRNAs and FLAG-tagged EGFR
plasmids. FLAG-EGFR‚Äìexpressing cells had higher pEGFR and
increased pAKT levels compared with empty vector controls in
VEGF-depleted colorectal cancer cells validating our previous
observations (Supplementary Fig. S11).

Discussion
The biology behind tumor-derived VEGF's regulation of the
functions of endothelial cells and the tumor vasculature has been
well characterized (1, 18, 23). However, the roles and effects of
VEGF signaling in or on tumor cells are still not well understood.
Multiple studies indicate that VEGF has a direct effect on the
survival and growth of a variety of cancer cells (24‚Äì28), mostly
through an autocrine signaling mechanism. Lee and colleagues
(11) showed that the depletion of VEGF or VEGFR1 in breast
cancer cells resulted in reduced tumor cell survival and postulated
that VEGF functions as an intracellular autocrine or "intracrine"
survival factor. Our previous study using VEGF-deÔ¨Åcient human

Intracrine VEGF Mediates Survival Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Cells

Figure 6.
Intracellular VEGF signaling is mediated through a tyrosine phosphatase. Levels of total and phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2 were measured in HCT116, SW480, and
HT29 cells transfected with control siRNA (Con siRNA) or VEGF siRNA and then treated with okadaic acid (4 nmol/L) or Na3VO4 (100 mmol/L) for 16 hours.

colorectal cancer cell lines generated by genetic deletion (29)
showed that VEGF acts as a survival factor for human colorectal
cancer cells (12). These effects were not mediated in an autocrine
or paracrine fashion, suggesting that VEGF has an intracrine
function in colorectal cancer cells.
In this study, we present further evidence for the novel
intracrine signaling pathway regulated by intracellular VEGF
and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cell survival.
Depletion of VEGF by siRNAs recapitulated the effects of
somatic VEGF depletion in colorectal cancer cells, i.e., reduced
survival and enhanced chemosensitivity, suggesting that VEGF
depletion combined with chemotherapy may prove beneÔ¨Åcial
to patients where conventional therapy, including VEGF-targeted therapies, has failed. RPPA analyses and validation
experiments indicated that VEGF depletion reduced the activity
of survival molecules AKT and ERK1/2. These pathways were
unaffected when colorectal cancer cells were treated with antibodies inhibiting VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR interactions or with VEGFR
kinase inhibitors. In addition, supplementing the media of
VEGF siRNA‚Äìtreated colorectal cancer cells with recombinant
VEGF also failed to rescue the effects of VEGF depletion on AKT
and ERK1/2.
Interestingly, we found that tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors,
rather than Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors, rescued effects of
VEGF depletion on AKT. Through unbiased assays, we also
show that phosphorylation of multiple RTKs is decreased
in VEGF-depleted colorectal cancer cells in comparison with
colorectal cancer cells with normal VEGF levels. Treating VEGFdepleted colorectal cancer cells with a tyrosine phosphatase
inhibitor rescued the reduced phosphorylation of the RTKs.
Based on our Ô¨Åndings, we propose that VEGF depletion activates a tyrosine phosphatase to reduce activity of multiple
RTKs, which in turn leads to reduced activity of AKT and
ERK1/2, resulting in decreased cell survival and enhanced
chemosensitivity (Fig. 7). Future studies, including identiÔ¨Åcation of the phosphatase and depletion of the phosphatase, are
required to elucidate the mechanism underlying VEGF/VEGFR's
role in cell survival.

www.aacrjournals.org

Another key Ô¨Ånding from our study is that VEGFR1 depletion, similar to VEGF depletion, reduces pAKT levels. Inhibition
of VEGF-VEGFR1 binding by bevacizumab or 18F1, or targeting
the kinase activity using two different receptor kinase inhibitors, failed to produce similar effects. Also, in vitro immunoprecipitation experiments indicated the intracellular formation
of a VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR1 complex. These observations strongly suggest that a VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR1 complex is functional in the intracrine signaling mechanism. The possibility of a VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR1
intracellular complex has been postulated before in breast
cancer cells (11). A separate study in mouse skin tumors also
indicated that VEGF-VEGFR1 is required for tumor cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner (30). Put together, these
Ô¨Åndings strongly support a VEGF-VEGFR1‚Äìmediated intracrine
signaling in multiple cancer types and suggest a new kinaseindependent function for VEGFR1 in regulating signaling pathways in cancer cell survival. However, to better understand the
role of VEGFR1 in this intracrine signaling process, studies
using kinase-dead mutants of VEGFR1 and identifying possible
interacting partners are warranted.
The discovery of VEGF's importance in angiogenesis, a process
essential to tumor growth (31), led to VEGF's importance as a
therapeutic target. Although targeting VEGF has proven effective
against certain tumor types, such as renal cell carcinoma (32, 33),
the overall beneÔ¨Åts of blocking VEGF signaling have not been as
beneÔ¨Åcial as initially expected (6, 23, 34‚Äì36), and multiple
mechanisms of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy have been proposed (5, 37, 38). However, understanding the mechanisms of
intracrine VEGF signaling and its effects on tumor cell survival
presents new possibilities for targeting VEGF not only in tumor
cells but also in endothelial cells that are susceptible to the
depletion of intracellular VEGF (39). Such targeting can be
achieved with advances in the delivery of VEGF-targeting siRNAs
using liposomal formulations. One such study targeting VEGF
and kinesin spindle protein in human patients has shown some
interesting Ô¨Åndings, including a patient with a complete response
to therapy (40). In fact, Ô¨Åndings from our studies (12) suggest that
inhibiting intracrine VEGF signaling would have maximum beneÔ¨Åt when combined with chemotherapy.

The roles of VEGF-VEGFR signaling and the effects of inhibiting
VEGF and/or VEGFR in various cancers are quite complex. Some
recent studies of glioblastoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors in mouse models have indicated that antiangiogenesis
therapy may induce tumor invasiveness and increase metastasis
(41, 42). Similar results have been observed in human breast
cancer cells in mice (43). However, the implications of these
studies in humans are not well understood. These effects were
shown to result from increased c-MET activation due to VEGF
blockade (42, 44), where blocking paracrine VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR2
interaction inactivated the PTP1B phosphatase to increase pcMET levels (44). Inversely, our Ô¨Åndings suggest that an intracellular VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR1 complex interacts and inactivates an as-yet
unidentiÔ¨Åed tyrosine phosphatase in colorectal cancer cells.
Depletion of either VEGF or VEGFR1 results in activation of this
phosphatase, resulting in reduced RTK activation. Our previous
studies (8, 12) indicate that colorectal cancer cells predominantly
express VEGFR1 in contrast to VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. Also,
our studies and the previous study in breast cancer cells (11)
indicate that VEGFR1 is mostly intracellular and found in
both, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. ImmunoÔ¨Çuorescence and
colocalization studies indicate that most of the VEGF and VEGFR1
interaction is at the nuclear membrane and in other parts of the
cytoplasm. However, based on the functional consequences
(reduction of RTK, AKT activity), we hypothesize that the intracellular signaling is mainly due to the cytoplasmic or perinuclear
VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR1 complexes. Based on these Ô¨Åndings, intracellular
VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR1 complexes and VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR2 complexes
formed at cell membrane appear to have opposing effects on
RTK activation and thus on cell viability and migration. Thus,
the VEGF receptor status and their location in the tumor cells
may dictate the function of VEGF signaling and their effects on
tumor cells.
In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism of intracrine VEGF signaling that mediates the survival of colorectal
cancer cells. This study also demonstrates that antiangiogenic
therapies targeting VEGF‚ÄìVEGFR interactions on the cell membrane or inhibiting VEGFR kinase activity do not affect colorectal
cancer cell survival through the mechanisms by which targeting
VEGF inside the cell does. Depleting intracellular VEGF appears to
effectively induce colorectal cancer cell death and enhance the
efÔ¨Åcacy of chemotherapy and thus provides new opportunities to
therapeutically manipulate the VEGF-dependent survival of these
cells.
