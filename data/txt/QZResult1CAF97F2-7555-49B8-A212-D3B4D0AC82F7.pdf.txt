Abstract
Tumor permeability is a critical determinant of drug delivery
and sensitivity, but systematic methods to identify factors that
perform permeability barrier functions in the tumor microenvironment are not yet available. Multicellular tumor spheroids
have become tractable in vitro models to study the impact of a
three-dimensional (3D) environment on cellular behavior. In
this study, we characterized the spheroid-forming potential of
cancer cells and correlated the resulting spheroid morphologies
with genetic information to identify conserved cellular processes associated with spheroid structure. Spheroids generated
from 100 different cancer cell lines were classiﬁed into four
distinct groups based on morphology. In particular, round
and compact spheroids exhibited highly hypoxic inner cores
and permeability barriers against anticancer drugs. Through

systematic and correlative analysis, we reveal JAK–STAT signaling as one of the signature pathways activated in round spheroids. Accordingly, STAT3 inhibition in spheroids generated
from the established cancer cells and primary glioblastoma
patient–derived cells altered the rounded morphology and
increased drug sensitivity. Furthermore, combined administration of the STAT3 inhibitor and 5-ﬂuorouracil to a mouse
xenograft model markedly reduced tumor growth compared
with monotherapy. Collectively, our ﬁndings demonstrate the
ability to integrate 3D culture and genetic proﬁling to determine the factors underlying the integrity of the permeability
barrier in the tumor microenvironment, and may help to
identify and exploit novel mechanisms of drug resistance.

Introduction

critical for permeability barrier. However, the methods to evaluate the physical characteristics of tumors are limited. The
classical two-dimensional (2D) cell culture system is not appropriate as it does not well reﬂect the architecture of tumors in vivo.
Although animal models can be used, they are time consuming,
difﬁcult to control, and inconvenient to monitor physical environment of tumors (6).
As tumor morphology is predominantly determined by cell–
cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions (7, 8) involving
adhesion molecules and receptors (9, 10), the morphology and
architecture of solid tumors is better reﬂected in three-dimensional (3D) culture than in monolayer culture (11, 12). The
classical 3D culture model is multicellular spheroids, which are
formed by self-assembly induced by cell–cell and cell–matrix
interactions. Multicellular spheroids possess architecture resembling the structural and functional features of tumor tissue (12).
For example, conditions of hypoxia and low nutrient concentration are generated in their core regions because of limited
diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to their interiors (13, 14). In
addition, heterogeneous cell populations are spontaneously
induced in cancer spheroids by nutrient gradients (15). Adapting to metabolic insufﬁciency, the core cells of spheroid become
quiescent and resistant to apoptosis (16, 17). Because of their
tumor tissue–like characteristics, tumor spheroids have become
increasingly attractive models to investigate cancer pathophysiology and develop antitumor therapeutics (18). In this work, we
have employed the structural characteristics of tumor spheroids

The hyperproliferation of cancer cells can generate tight cell–
cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions that are responsible for permeability barrier to oxygen, nutrition, and drug (1, 2).
As this microenvironment would affect cancer cell growth and
drug resistance (3–5), it is important to identify the factors

and genetic proﬁles of cancer cells to identify signal pathways
that could be implicated for the determination of tumor permeability and selected STAT3 as a target for further in-depth
studies. We validated its signiﬁcance for the determination of
tumor permeability using cancer patient–derived primary cells
and in vivo tumor model.

HCC-1195, HCC-15, HCC-1588, HCC-2108, and HCC-44 cell
lines were obtained from Korean Cell Line Bank, and the others
cell lines were obtained from ATCC. All cell lines, obtained 2 years
ago, were authenticated by SNP ﬁngerprinting and used within 20
passages. Cells were cultured in 10% FBS-containing media,
including DMEM, RPMI1640, Minimum Essential Medium, and
Eagle Minimum Essential Medium (Hyclone).
GBM patient–derived primary cell culture
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient–derived primary
cell clones were obtained from GBM patients who had brain
surgery at the Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) in
accordance with the appropriate Institutional Review Boards.
Dissociated GBM cells were cultured on the laminin (SigmaAldrich)-coated ﬂasks. GBM patient–derived primary cells were
cultured in neurobasal media with N2 and B27 supplements
(0.5, Invitrogen) and human recombinant basic ﬁbroblast
growth factor and EGF (25 ng/mL, R&D Systems; refs. 19, 20).
Genetic proﬁles were used to select molecular signatures, contributing to the separation of the spheroid types. The GEO
accession numbers for the gene expression and comparative
genomic hybridization data used in this article are GSE42670
and GSE58401.
3D cell culture
The 2D cultured cells prior to the third passage were dissociated
to single cells by Accumax (Millipore) and seeded to Lipidurecoated 3D culture plate (NOF Corporation). Spheroid morphology was monitored by bright-ﬁeld function of ﬂuorescence
microscopy (Nikon C1). Live images of spheroid formation were
acquired in 10-minute interval snapshots. These images were
taken in 5% CO2 incubator by using the bright-ﬁeld function of
Juli smart ﬂuorescence cell analyzer (Digital Bio Technology)
equipped with a 10 objective lens for 36 hours. The growth
rate was determined by counting the spheroid cell number at the
indicated day. Spheroids (2,000 cells seeded per well) were
incubated with Accumax for 30 minutes to get single cells. The
number of dissociated single cells was counted with disposable
hemocytometer C-Chip (INCYTO).
Hypoxia assay
The hypoxic region inside the spheroid was detected by the
hypoxia probe, LOX-1 (Scivax), as described previously (21).
Brieﬂy, the spheroid was cultured for 5 or 6 days and then treated
with 2 mmol/L LOX-1 for 24 hours. Red-phosphorescence was

Results
Validation of multicellular cancer spheroid
To generate tumor spheroids, we used a low-attachment plate
that was coated with 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine
(MPC). As MPC has the same structure as phosphatidylcholine
polar bases of cell membrane, it simulates human cell membrane–like surface (22). Cancer cells were ﬁrst cultured in 2D
culture plate to generate sufﬁcient cell numbers. After two rounds
of subculture, the cells were transferred to the 3D culture plate to
induce spheroid formation. After spheroid formation, the medium was changed every 3 days and the spheroids were monitored
for 1 to 4 weeks. We validated our spheroid culture system using
non–small cell lung cancer H1650 cells. The spheroid formation
and culture were observed by bright-ﬁeld function of live cell
imaging and ﬂuorescence microscopy EMCCD, respectively.
Spheroid size increased for 9 days and was sustained up to 30
days while the core region became dense (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). Cell proliferation rate was signiﬁcantly slower in spheroids
than in monolayer culture system (doubling time of 3 and 1.5
days, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1B). To determine whether there was a correlation between spheroid size and seeded cell
number, different quantities of cells were seeded and the sizes of
resulting spheroids were determined after 6-day incubation.
Spheroid size and seeded cell number showed positive correlation
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). The cells inside of the spheroids may
become hypoxic due to their 3D structure (15). To monitor
hypoxic conditions, we extracted proteins from spheroid cells
and performed immunoblotting to detect the presence of hypoxia
markers such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1a; ref. 23) and
HSP70 (24), as well as E-cadherin which mediates cell–cell
contact (8). We found that the expression levels of these three
proteins were signiﬁcantly increased in spheroids. In the same
condition, the levels of EGFR were decreased in 3D cells as
expected (25) whereas those of GAPDH were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S1D). We further conﬁrmed hypoxic status by
detecting the increase of HIF1a and VEGF mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
To further investigate whether hypoxic conditions existed in the
internal core region, we incubated spheroids grown for 5 days
with a spheroid permeable hypoxia probe, LOX-1 (21) for 24
hours, and monitored the staining of LOX-1 by ﬂuorescence
microscopy. The LOX-1 signal was observed in spheroids but not
in LOX-1 untreated and monolayer culture (Supplementary
Fig. S1F). Despite hypoxic conditions, the internal structures of
the cancer spheroids were populated with viable cells when the
cells were checked after 6-day incubation (Supplementary Fig.
S1G). These results demonstrate that the culture system used in
this study generates typical cancer spheroids.

Morphologic classiﬁcation and characteristics of cancer
spheroids
Using this culture system, we examined 100 different human
cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A) and classiﬁed them on the basis of
spheroid morphology using bright-ﬁeld function of ﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). The
cancer cells (1,000 cells/well) became spheroids with the
diameter from 200 to 1,000 mm after 6-day incubation. From
the 100 tested cancer cell lines, we classiﬁed 91 cell lines into
three distinct groups: round (R, 50 cases), mass (M, 14 cases),
and aggregate-type (A, 27 cases; Fig. 1C). Nine cancer cell lines
failed to form spheroids (N type). To monitor spheroid organization and cell–cell adhesion, we used F-actin staining as they
are critical for cellular structure and tight junctions (26). The Rtype cell lines generated round and compact spheroids with
tight cell–cell adhesion, whereas the M-type cells formed the
spheroids of unstructured outline with moderate cell–cell
adhesion. The A-type cells showed a distinct aggregate-like
morphology with weak cell–cell interactions (Fig. 1D). The

R- and M-type cells generated organized spheroids at early time,
whereas the A-type cells showed disorganized aggregation
(Supplementary Movies S1A–S1C).
To determine a relationship between cell proliferation rate and
spheroid morphology, we compared the proliferation rates of
three representative lung cancer cells (H226: R-type, H460: Mtype, A549: A-type) between 2D and 3D culture systems. Although
the growth rate of R-type H226 and M-type H460 cells were the
lowest and highest in both culture systems, respectively, the
growth rate of the A-type A549 cells was signiﬁcantly reduced in
3D culture system (Fig. 1E; Supplementary Fig. S2A). As tight cellto-cell interaction induces pericellular hypoxia (27), hypoxia
status was determined to check the correlation between spheroid
morphology and cell-to-cell interaction. We used LOX-1 staining
to measure the hypoxia in the interiors of the 5-day cultured
spheroids. Signiﬁcantly higher LOX-1 staining was observed in the
R-type spheroids compared with the two other types (Fig. 1F;
Supplementary Fig. S2B). In the 2D culture system, none of the
tested cancer cell lines displayed a hypoxia signal based on LOX-1

ﬂuorescence microscopy. P value was determined by
one-way ANOVA.  , P < 0.01.

staining (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The two colon cancer cell
lines, LoVo and SW480, formed the R- and A-type spheroids,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2D). We detected elevated
mRNA levels of HIF1a and VEGF in the 3D spheroids compared
with those in the 2D cultured LoVo, but not SW480, cells (Supplementary Fig. S2E and S2F). We further compared cell proliferation and hypoxia in the 2D and 3D systems of nine different
cancer cell lines (lung cancer: H441, H23, Calu-6; colon cancer:
LoVo, SW480, Colo205; GBM: LN18, U251MG, U251E4). The Mtype (H23 and U251MG) and R-type spheroids (H441, LoVo, and
LN18) showed the highest proliferation rate and hypoxia status,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). These results suggest
that the R-type spheroids generate hypoxic condition within their
lumens due to tight cell–cell interaction.
We also measured drug permeability of spheroids as an independent indicator for the compactness of spheroids. Cell–cell
interaction may form a diffusion barrier that would affect the
delivery of anticancer drugs to the interiors of solid tumors (28,
29). Using three lung cancer cell lines (H226: R-type, H460: Mtype, A549: A-type), which are representative of the different
spheroid types, we compared the effective doses of four known
antitumor drugs [5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU), SN-38, sorafenib, and 17AAG) in 2D and 3D culture conditions. As 2D and 3D culture
systems have different cell proliferation rates and structures, we
used different conditions to determine drug sensitivity. In the 2D
culture system, the cells were incubated with drugs for 1.5 days
and the cell viability was monitored by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) assay of the cell lysates. In this condition, all three tested
cell lines showed similar drug sensitivity. Then, the cells were
cultured in a 3D plate for 4 days and incubated with drugs for an
additional 3 days and cell viability was determined as above. The
spheroids of H226 cells showed higher resistance to all of the
tested drugs compared with those of the two other cells (Table 1).
To see whether this difference is generally applicable, we used an
additional nine different cancer cell lines to compare drug sensitivity. Among the tested cell lines, the R-type spheroids (H441,
LoVo, and LN18) showed higher resistance to drugs (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Thus, all the results suggest that the R-type spheroids would build up higher physical barrier to drugs due to tighter
cell–cell adhesion.
Association of genetic proﬁles with spheroid morphology
To see whether the genetic characteristics of cell lines are related
to spheroid morphology, we obtained gene expression, mutation,
and copy number variation (CNV) data for the 70 tested cancer
Table 1. The IC50 values of four different anticancer drugs (5-FU, SN-38,
sorafenib, and 17-AAG) were determined in 2D and 3D cancer cells (H226, H460,
and A549 lung cancer cell lines)

cells (30, 11, 21, and 8 cell lines for R-, M-, A-, and N-types,
respectively) from the database of Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(30). Among a total of 22,285 genes, we identiﬁed 2,202 genes
that signiﬁcantly [P < 0.05 for variable importance on the projection (VIP)] correlated with the four types of spheroids using
multiblock partial least square-discriminant analysis (MPLS-DA).
These 2,202 genes were then characterized by the mRNA abundance, mutations, and CNV, for 926, 65, and 1,333 genes,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Of these 2,202 genes, we
focused on 560 genes that showed either high or low abundance
of mRNA expression, mutations, and CNV (313, 32, and 229
genes, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4D). The MPLS-DA
model revealed that these signatures could stratify the 70 tested
cancer cells into the four different types of spheroids (Fig. 2A)
using six latent variables (LV; Supplementary Table S2), with a
prediction accuracy of larger than 90% (Supplementary Fig. S4E)
and misclassiﬁcation error of less than 10%, during leave-oneout-cross-validations (Supplementary Fig. S4F). The block contribution in MPLS indicated that among the three types of molecular signatures, mRNA and CNV data signiﬁcantly contributed to
the ability of stratifying cancer cells into the different spheroid
classes (Supplementary Fig. S4G). Although the genetic proﬁles
are well separated by spheroid morphology, they are not always
correlated with the results of pharmacodynamics (31) because the
drug sensitivity can be varied depending on experimental conditions. To avoid the potential variation resulting from experimental conditions, we applied a different drug treatment condition
that is adjusted to 2D and 3D culture systems but used the same
cell viability assay.
We hypothesized that the molecular signatures for the 560
genes represent cellular processes or pathways crucial for the
characteristics of the spheroids. Thus, we identiﬁed cellular
processes signiﬁcantly (P < 0.1) represented by the 560 signature genes by enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology Biological Processes (GOBP) using the DAVID software (32; Fig.
2B). The results showed that molecular signatures of the R-type
spheroids were implicated in cellular processes relating to cell
proliferation (regulation of cell proliferation and DNA replication) and defense response (T-cell receptor and JAK–STAT
signaling). The M- and A-type spheroids were characterized by
the MAPK pathway/DNA damage responses and by ion transport/neurologic process, respectively. We then reconstructed
network models delineating these cellular processes, using
only the genes showing spheroid-type speciﬁc molecular signatures. The network deﬁned by the R-type spheroid signatures
revealed high expression of mRNAs and CNV for cell surface
molecules (CD53 and CD79B), cytokine–cytokine receptors
(IL3/4/13, CSF2, IL3RA, and IL19A), and secreted molecules
(F5, ADIPOR1, SPOCK2, and CMA1), which activate JAK–
STAT, T-cell receptor, small GTPase-mediated, and cell
cycle–related signaling pathways and their downstream transcriptional regulators (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S5A).
The network deﬁned by the M-type spheroid signatures showed
high expression of mRNA and CNV for molecules related to
Integrin, Notch, and ERBB–MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting association with cytoskeleton organization and proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The network deﬁned by A-type
spheroid signatures showed high expression of mRNA and CNV
in genes implicated with neurologic system–related processes
such as GRIN2D, a neurotransmitter receptor, its downstream
signaling pathway (RGS12/16, GNAI3, and PTGS2), and

STAT3 as a Factor for Tumor Permeability Barrier

CACNA16, a calcium transporter (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
These networks suggest a set of cellular processes or signaling
pathways that could be involved in determining spheroid
morphology.
JAK–STAT pathway involved in round-type spheroid
We then investigated whether one of the signaling pathways
suggested above would be functionally involved in spheroid
morphology. We focused our attention to the JAK–STAT pathway,
which was suggested as one of the signature pathways for R-type
spheroids (Fig. 2C). Although STAT3 is known to enhance the
antiapoptotic protein expression (33), prevent the cell-cycle arrest
(34), and correlate with poor clinical prognosis (35, 36), it is not
yet known whether STAT3 is involved in the physical characteristics of solid tumors. When we compared the expression and
activation of STAT3 among the three cell lines representing
different spheroid types, we found that total and phosphorylated
STAT3 (T709) levels were higher in the R-type H226 cells than in
the two other cell lines. In addition, the levels of cadherins and
CD44, the membrane proteins for cell–cell interaction, were also
higher in the R-type H226 cells (Fig. 3A). To test whether the
inhibition of STAT3 would change the morphology of the R-type
spheroids, we treated the R-type H226 and H441 cells with
AG490, a JAK2-speciﬁc inhibitor, and monitored changes in
spheroid morphology. After 3-day incubation with AG490, the
outer layers of the spheroids were loosened (Supplementary
Fig. S6A), and their lumens showed reduced hypoxic condition
(Fig. 3B). The AG490-treated spheroids of H226 cells also
decreased the levels of cadherins and CD44 as well as the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 (Fig. 3C).
As the R-type spheroids showed higher resistance to anticancer
drugs, we tested whether AG490 treatment would enhance anticancer drug sensitivity by improving drug penetration. First, we
monitored the signiﬁcance of the JAK–STAT pathway in drug
penetration using bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation
(BiFC) system that detects the rapamycin-induced interaction
between FKBP12 and FRB domain of mTOR (37, 38). We fused
complementary fragments of Venus ﬂuorescence protein to the Cterminal ends of FKBP12 and FRB. Rapamycin-induced association between FKBP12 and FRB would be detected by restoration of
functional Venus ﬂuorescence. The ﬂuorescence intensity resulting from the rapamycin-dependent association of the two fusion
proteins was increased in the spheroids treated with AG490 and
rapamycin (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S6B and S6C). As the
effect of rapamycin is usually indicated by the phosphorylation of
S6K, we also monitored whether S6K phosphorylation is affected
by AG490 treatment. The cotreatment of AG490 and rapamycin
signiﬁcantly reduced phosphorylation of S6K (Supplementary
Fig. S6D). Second, we directly measured drug penetration in
spheroids by LC/MS-MS analysis as previously described (39),

using 17-AAG as a testing drug as it showed unique peak in
LC/MS-MS analysis. After 2-day preincubation with AG490, we
treated H226 spheroids with 17-AAG for 5 hours. The concentration of 17-AAG in the spheroids was increased 2.2-fold by
AG490 treatment (Fig. 3E).
To determine the signiﬁcance of the JAK–STAT pathway for
tumor permeability, we treated H226 spheroids with 5-FU and
17-AAG (showing weak cytotoxicity in R-type spheroids; see Table
1) alone or in combination with AG490, and examined how
AG490 treatment affects the cytotoxicity of the two drugs. The
treatment of 5-FU and 17-AAG with AG490 enhanced the cell
death to 43% and 54%, respectively, whereas 5-FU and 17-AAG
alone induced the cell death to 10% and 15%, respectively
(Fig. 3F). Although the inhibition of STAT3 itself might induce
autophagy-mediated cell death that could also reduce the permeability barrier (40), cell death was not observed with STAT3
inhibition in our culture system. Taken together, these data
suggest the importance of the JAK–STAT pathway for determination of the R-type spheroids and tumor permeability.
Validation of JAK–STAT pathway in drug sensitivity of patientderived spheroids
To further validate our analysis, we obtained primary cells from
9 different GBM patients that were previously reported (19, 20),
and classiﬁed them on the basis of spheroid morphology. The
patient-derived cells also formed one of the three different spheroid morphology types (Fig. 4A, the numbers represent patients'
identiﬁcation). We analyzed gene expression and CNV data from
these cells and identiﬁed 1,831 genes that signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05
for VIP) correlated with the four types of spheroids using MPLS in
mRNA abundance and CNV (for 1,572 and 301 genes, respectively). Among the 186 genes with the R type–speciﬁc molecular
signatures (Supplementary Fig. S4A), 36 genes showed mRNA

patient–derived R-type spheroids (Supplementary Fig. S7A and

(Fig. 4B). We then examined the relationships between the 36
genes and the JAK–STAT signature (7 R type–speciﬁc genes related
to JAK–STAT pathway) from cell lines. To this end, we identiﬁed
the overlapping genes between the two gene sets and then evaluated the signiﬁcance of the overlapping genes using the hypergeometric test. The 36 genes and their interactors included 2 and 6
of the 7 genes related to the JAK–STAT pathway, respectively (P ¼

speciﬁc network (Fig. 2C) revealed the two overlapping genes (IL3
and IL13), the links of 12 genes related to the JAK–STAT pathway

36 genes in the downstream target genes of JAK–STAT pathway
including TNFSF11, PATZ1, WDR6, CDT1, and TLK1 (Supplementary Fig. S7D). All these data suggest that the 36-gene signature from patient-derived R-type spheroids was closely linked to
JAK–STAT signature identiﬁed from the cell lines. To conﬁrm this
possibility, we determined the activation of STAT3 among different patient-derived cancer cells and found that STAT3 was highly
activated in the R-type GBM spheroids (Fig. 4C). When we treated
these spheroids with AG490, the R-type morphology was changed
to a more loose structure (Fig. 4D) with the decrease of phosphorylated STAT3 (Fig. 4E). To see whether the inhibition of
STAT3 would sensitize the cancer cells to 5-FU, we treated the 047
cancer cells with either 5-FU or AG490 or both, and monitored cell
death. We found that the cytotoxicity of 5-FU was greatly
enhanced by the combined treatment with AG490 (Fig. 4F).

In vivo validation of JAK–STAT pathway in drug sensitivity
The signiﬁcance of the JAK–STAT pathway in drug sensitivity of
tumors was also tested in mouse xenograft model using H1650
cells that forms R-type spheroids with hyperactivated STAT3 and
shows drug resistance in vivo (41). The mice were treated with 5-FU
or AG490 alone, and 5-FU plus AG490 as described in Materials
and Methods, and their effect on tumor growth was monitored.
Treatment with 5-FU suppressed tumor growth, whereas AG490
had little effect (Fig. 5A). Combination of 5-FU with AG490
further reduced tumor growth. None of these treatments inﬂuenced body weight (Supplementary Fig. S8A). When tumor
weights were compared after sacriﬁcing the mice, similar results
were obtained (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S8B). The effect of
chemicals on cell–cell adhesion was examined by Western blotting with cell adhesion markers such as EpCAM and E-cadherin.

Both markers were signiﬁcantly suppressed by the combined
treatment of AG490 and 5-FU in two independent samples (Fig.
5C). We also compared cell death of the isolated tumor tissues
using TUNEL staining and found signiﬁcantly increased apoptosis
in the tumor tissues treated with 5-FU and AG490 (Fig. 5D). The
histologic analysis also showed that the tumors treated with
AG490 and 5-FU showed signiﬁcantly loosened tissue structure
(Fig. 5E).

Discussion
This work demonstrates that 100 different cancer cells could be
classiﬁed into four distinct 3D morphology types, suggesting that
the analysis of spheroid morphology could be a simple but
reliable way to predict tumor permeability. However, considering
genetic heterogeneity within each morphology type, genetic anal-

www.aacrjournals.org

ysis of cancer cells might be necessary to identify the signaling
pathways contributing to speciﬁc morphology. The permeability
barrier provides a condition to induce intratumoral heterogeneity
of cancer cells as the cells would have different microenvironments for nutrition and oxygen availability. For instance, cells in
the inner core of tumors with tight cell–cell adhesions would face
hypoxia and nutrition shortage due to high diffusion barrier of
external cells (3, 29). Meanwhile, these cells may acquire mutations or epigenetic changes allowing them to survive these harsh
conditions (2, 42).
In our experiments, spheroid morphology did not show tissue
dependency, suggesting that genes involved in tissue differentiation would not be the predominant determinants for spheroid
morphology. Systematic analysis of the genetic proﬁles suggested
the group of genes distinct for the four different types of spheroids.
Among the four types of tumor spheroids, the round type showed

the most compact structure with the highest degree of drug
resistance. They showed unique genetic signatures including the
JAK–STAT signaling pathway. In this context, STAT3 activates the
NF-kB pathway through direct interaction with RELA in the
nucleus of cancer cells, leading to the enhancement of cell proliferation, survival, and invasion (43). Constitutively, active
STAT3 has been observed in a variety of human cancers (44).
Besides, it has been shown to upregulate EpCAM and CD44, the
membrane proteins associated with cell–cell adhesion (45),
implying a potential role of STAT3 in the determination of tumor
structure and morphology. We found that inhibition of STAT3
rendered the round type more permeable to drug penetration,
supporting the functional signiﬁcance of STAT3 in tumor permeability although the causal relationship of STAT3 to the determination of tumor permeability is not completely clear at this
moment. STAT3 is also known to confer resistance against hypoxia (43). As the round-type spheroids would generate hypoxic
conditions due to the compact adhesion of the cells, the activation
of STAT3 would be helpful for the survival of the cancer cells under
hypoxic conditions. In monolayer cell conditions, the potential
ability to mediate the physical properties of tumors cannot be
easily detected. Therefore, combined analysis of tumor spheroids
with genetic proﬁles can help to identify new therapeutic targets,

1052 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

and also to understand the physical context of known targets in an
environment simulating different tumor types.
Morphologic analysis of tumor spheroids can also be
explored for clinical application and drug discovery. Much
effort has been invested to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance of tumors to anticancer drugs.
One well-known form of resistance is to extrude drugs from
cells by plasma membrane-transport proteins (46). For drug
resistance that falls outside of this category, tumors can become
resistant as a consequence of mutations of genes encoding
intracellular targets and affecting associated pathways. These
mutations can affect the drug–target interactions or induce
compensatory pathways (47). Another potential mechanism
for drug resistance that is more relevant to this study is the
permeability barrier to drugs. Although many key mediators in
cell proliferation and death have been intensively tested for
therapeutic potential, the factors implicated for the physical
properties of solid tumors are less explored. To design an
effective therapeutic strategy, the physical environment of the
tumor structure should also be taken into account. Combined
analysis of spheroid morphology and genetic proﬁles could be
an effective way to discover new therapeutic targets and to
design an efﬁcient therapeutic strategy for cancer patients.
