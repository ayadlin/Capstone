ABSTRACT
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is up-regulated in thyroid cancer and small molecule
FAK scaffolding inhibitor, Y15, was shown to decrease cancer growth in vitro and in
vivo. We sought to test the effectiveness of Y15 in thyroid cancer cell lines, profile
gene expression with Y15 compared with clinical trial FAK inhibitor PF-04554878,
and use Y15 in novel drug combinations. Cell viability was decreased in a dose
dependent manner in four thyroid cancer cell lines with Y15 and with higher doses
in PF-04554878. Y397 FAK and total FAK were decreased with Y15 and decreased
less with PF-04554878. Detachment and necrosis were increased in a dose-dependent
manner in all cell lines with Y15. Clonogenicity was decreased in a dose-dependent
manner for both Y15 and PF-04554878. We compared gene profiles between papillary
thyroid cell lines, TPC1, BCPAP and K1, and 380, 109, and 74 genes were significantly
>2-fold changed with Y15 treatment, respectively. Common up-regulated genes were
involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, transcription and heat shock; down-regulated genes
were involved in cell cycle, cell-to-cell interactions, and cancer stem cell markers.
We also compared gene profiles of TT cells treated with Y15 versus PF-04554878.
Y15 caused 144 genes to change over 4 fold and PF-04554878 caused 208 gene
changes >4-fold (p<0.05). Among genes changed 4 fold, 11 were shared between
the treatments, including those involved in metabolism, cell cycle, migration and
transcription. Y15 demonstrated synergy with PF-04554878 in TT cells and also
synergy with Cabozantinib, Sorafenib, Pazopanib, and strong synergy with Sunitinib
in resistant K1 cells. This report revealed the biological effect of Y15 inhibitor,
detected the unique and common gene signature profiles in response to Y15 in 4
different thyroid cancer cell lines, demonstrated differential response changes with
Y15 and PF-04554878 treatment, and showed the synergy of Y15 with PF-04554878,

cancer cases diagnosed are papillary or follicular thyroid
carcinomas, which are derived from thyroid follicular
epithelial cells. About 5% of cases are medullary thyroid

cancers are anaplastic, a dedifferentiated tumor, or tumors
of non-thyroid origin, such as sarcoma and lymphoma.
Papillary thyroid cancer is usually treated with total
thyroidectomy, with or without lymphadenectomy. If
the tumor takes up iodine, radioactive iodine can be
used to destroy any remaining tumor, but there are no
chemotherapeutic or directed therapies used regularly.
Early stages of medullary thyroid cancer are treated
similarly, but due to its aggressiveness, aggressive
treatment with lymphadenectomy and radiation is done
more frequently [2]. Additionally, advanced medullary
cancer can now be treated with adjuvant targeted therapies:
recently FDA approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
Vandetanib and Cabozantinib [3]. There are also drugs
undergoing clinical trials to treat thyroid cancer: Sorafenib,
Pazopanib, and Sunitinib. All three of these drugs inhibit
VEGFR-1, -2, -3, and PDGFR-β. In addition, Sorafenib
also inhibits Raf-1 and B-Raf; Pazopanib also inhibits
FGFR-1, -3, c-kit and c-fms; and Sunitinib also inhibits
RET. These are similar to the approved drugs: Vandetanib
which targets RET, VEGFR, and EGFR; and Cabozantinib
which also inhibits RET and VEGFR2 and additionally
inhibits c-met [4]. While thyroid cancer can be curable
with resection of low stage tumors, especially papillary
thyroid cancer, new treatments are needed for advanced
differentiated cancers with radioiodine resistance.
In order to overcome the current radioiodine
resistance within thyroid cancer, identifying and targeting
other proteins of interest may work in tandem to effectively
treat thyroid cancer. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is one
of these targets. FAK is expressed in all cells at a low
basal level, however it is significantly overexpressed in a
majority of solid tumors, including papillary carcinomas,
with even higher levels of expression in metastatic
tumors [5]. The focal adhesion complexes where FAK
resides not only helps tether the cell to the extracellular
matrix, but also is a hub for signal transduction, mediated
by FAK. FAK’s autophosphorylation site at Y397 allows
for the binding of Src, PI3 kinase, Grb-7, Shc, and other
SH2 domain containing proteins. The binding of Src to
the phosphorylated Y397 leads to downstream signaling
and mediates the further phosphorylation of FAK [6].
Activation of FAK results in increased cell survival,
motility, and proliferation, leading to angiogenesis,
metastasis, and invasion of tumors. FAK is therefore
identified as a promising cancer drug target.
One FAK inhibitor, PF-04554878, is in a
phase I clinical trial for ovarian cancer (clinical trial
#NCT01778803) [7]. Recently a FAK autophosphorylation
inhibitor was identified: 1,2,4,5-Benzenetetraamine
tetrahyrdrochloride (called Y15) [8]. Y15 treatment
in vitro resulted in decreased cell viability, increased
detachment, and increased apoptosis in colon cancer
cells [9], breast cancer cells, and melanoma [8]. Y15 was
also tested in vivo using colon cancer cell lines and
caused decreased tumor growth. It also demonstrated an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enhancement in tumor growth inhibition when combined
with 5-FU and oxaliplatin [9]. The mechanism by which
Y15 affects thyroid cells is still unknown although other
tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to be effective.
In this report, we compared the effect of Y15 in different
thyroid cancer cell lines, compared gene expression
in three papillary thyroid cell lines in response to Y15
and also compared the effect of Y15 and PF-04554878
inhibitors in a medullary cell line, TT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
The thyroid cancer cell lines: TPC1, TT and
BCPAP were maintained according to protocol in RPMI
plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (37 °C, in 5% CO2). K1 was maintained in a
2:1:1 ratio of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle, Ham’s F-12, and
MCDB 105 mediums plus 2mM Glutamine, %10 FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Antibodies
Monoclonal (clone 4.47) anti-FAK antibody
(Millipore) and polyclonal anti-phospho-Tyr397
FAK antibody (Enzo) were used to detect total and
phosphorylated FAK. Monoclonal GAPDH antibody
was used for a loading control (Invitrogen). Secondary
mouse (from sheep) and rabbit (from donkey) horseradish
peroxidase linked IgG (GE Healthcare UK Unlimited)
were used for the secondary antibodies.

Small molecule inhibitors
1,2,4,5-Benzenetetraamine tetrahyrdrochloride (Y15)
is an allosteric FAK inhibitor and was ordered from Sigma.
Y15 was dissolved in 1× PBS at a concentration of 25 mM
and stored at −20 °C. Pazopanib, Sunitinib, and Sorafenib
were ordered from LC Laboratories and reconstituted in
DMSO at a concentration of 25mM. Cabozantinib was
ordered from Selleck Chem and solubilized in DMSO at
25mM. PF-04554878 was obtained from Adooq Bioscience
and dissolved in DMSO to concentration of 25mM.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed with 1× PBS and collected by
trypsinization. Collected cells were incubated on ice
in lysis buffer [50 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol] with protease inhibitors
(10  μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL PMSF, 1 μg/mL
aprotinin, 1 mM sodium vanadate and 5 mM sodium
fluoride) for 30 min. Lysed cells were spun in a
centrifuge to collect protein samples which were stored

at −80 °C. Protein samples (15 μg) were separated using
electrophoresis and transferred onto an Immobilon-P
PVDF membrane (Millipore), then incubated for one hour
in 1% BSA/0.01% Tween-20 in PBS. The membranes
were washed three times with 0.01% Tween-20 in PBS
and then were incubated with primary antibody for one
hour. The membranes were again washed three times with
0.01% Tween-20 in PBS before and after being incubated
in secondary antibody for one hour. The membranes
were then developed with Western Lightning PlusECL Enhanced Luminol Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer).
Photoshop and Illustrator were used to prepare images
from scanned films.

One hundred millimeter plates were seeded with TPC1,
K1, BCPAP and TT cells at a concentration of 1 × 10^6
cells in normal growth media. After overnight incubation,
plates were treated with one of several doses of Y15 or
left untreated. After another 24 h of incubation, cells
were collected with trypsin, and following centrifugation,
were washed with 1× PBS. Again, cells were centrifuged,
PBS was removed and cells were resuspended in binding
buffer and filtered through BD mesh tubes. Annexin V and
7-AAD were added to the solution, vortexed and incubated
for 15 minutes in the dark. Binding buffer was added and
the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 hour.

IC50 Curve Calculation

Viability

GraphPad Prism 6 software was used to graph
cell viability data. Raw data was matched to nonlinear
regression dynamic fitting curves for dose inhibition.
Statistical analyses were done using this program and
inhibitory concentration at 50% were calculated using 3 or
4 parameter variable slope log inhibitor response curves.

Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (10,000 cells
per well in 100 μL of medium plus 10% FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin). Twenty-four hours following
inhibitor treatment, 20 μL of Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) was added to
each well. After two hours of incubation with reagent and
the plate was read with the Gen 5 1.07 microplate reader at
490 nm. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.

Microarray Assay
Microarray assay was used to detect the changes
in gene expression between cell lines and with Y15 and
PF-04554878 treatment. One hundred millimeter plates
were seeded with 1x106 cells of TT cells. After incubating
24 hours to allow cell attachment the plates were treated
with 10 μM Y15 and 10 μM PF-04554878 in duplicate and
two plates were left untreated. The plates were allowed to
incubate for 24 hours and then the cells were collected.
The cells were submitted for gene expression profiling
to the gene microarray facility. HumanRef 8 whole
genome gene expression array and direct hybridization
assay (Illumina) was used to derive cDNA from 500ng
total RNA. The Ambion Illumina Total Prep RNA
Amplification Kit (Ambion) was used to make biotinlabeled cRNA via in vitro transcription of the cDNA.
Illumina HumanRef-8 v3 Bead Chips were made through
labeling and hybridizing probes at 58° C overnight and
then the fluorescence of each probe was measured; the
Bead Chips were analyzed with the Illumina Bead Array.
The data were entered into the NCBI Database with GEO
accession numbers GSE55619 and GSE55603.

Clonogenicity
Two 6-well plates were seeded with TPC1 and
K1 cells at a concentration of 500 cells per well in 2 mL
of media. BCPAP cells were plated at 1500 cells and 2mL
of media per well. After overnight incubation (37 °C,
5% CO2), each well was treated with a different Y15 doses
and left to incubate. After 14 days the media was aspirated
from each well and a solution of 1% methylene blue and
50% methanol was added. The cells were incubated in this
solution for 30 minutes to fixate and stain them. The colony
number in each well was counted in duplicate plates.

Detachment
Six-well plates were seeded with TPC1, K1, BCPAP
and TT cells in respective media at a concentration of
2 × 10^6 and allowed to incubate overnight to attach
to the plate. After 24 hours, each well was treated with
a specific Y15 dose. After an additional 24 hours, the
media from each well was collected and the number of
unattached cells in each well was counted three times with
a hemocytometer. The attached cells were collected with
trypsinization and counted in the same manner. For each
treatment condition the average percent of detached cells
was calculated by dividing the number of detached cells
by the number of total (attached plus detached) cells.

Bioinformatics and Statistical Analysis
The microarray data were analyzed by the R-based
Bioconductor package. The expression intensity
was converted to a log2 scale and then the Quantile
normalization algorithm was used to normalize;
according to the lumi model. Next, the limma program
was used to calculate the degree of expression for
each gene. A  significant difference in gene expression
was represented by p-value <0.05 and fold change at
least 1.2.

Apoptosis
Apoptosis assay was done with PE Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD) to identify apoptotic nuclei.

Statistics

cell line Y15 inhibited pY397 and total FAK expression
in a dose-dependent manner. TT was the most sensitive
cell line with effective inhibition of pY397 expression
by 3 μM Y15 (Figure 2A). TPC1 cells had inhibition of
phosphorylated FAK and total FAK expression at 30 μM
Y15 (Figure 2B). K1 had Y397-FAK and FAK inhibition
at 50 μM (Figure 2C) and BCPAP had inhibition of pY397
and FAK expression levels at 40 μM Y15 (Figure 2D).
Thus, Y15 decreased pY397 and total FAK levels in a
dose-dependent manner, most in the medullary thyroid
cancer cell line and to a lesser extent in the papillary
thyroid cancer cell lines.
We also tested the effect of the Pfizer inhibitor
PF-04554878 (now VS-6063) on thyroid cancer cell lines
to compare with Y15 inhibitor. In TT, TPC1, K1, and
BCPAP cells PF04554878 did not change the expression
of Y397 FAK and FAK as much as Y15 (Figure 2E). Thus,
PF-04554878 had less effect on Y397 FAK and FAK
expression compared to Y15 inhibitor.

Student’s t-test in Excel was used to calculate
p-values for determining statistical significance between
values for MTS, detachment, and apoptosis assays.
Threshold for p-value was set to <0.05.

RESULTS
Thyroid cancer cells expressed variable levels of
total and phosphorylated FAK, which decreased
with Y15 treatment
At first, we compared the level of expression of
FAK in untreated thyroid cancer cell lines (Figure 1). The
medullary cell line, TT, had comparatively low levels
of total FAK but a high level of phosphorylated FAK at
tyrosine 397 (pY397). In the papillary cell lines, TPC1
had high levels of total FAK, but even higher expression
of pY397 FAK. K1, another papillary cell line, had
intermediate expression of both FAK and pY397 FAK
and BCPAP, also a papillary cell line, had lower levels
of total FAK and intermediate expression of Y397, which
was the lowest expression of Y397 among all the cell lines
(Figure 1). Thus, all thyroid cell lines expressed variable
(intermediate and high) levels of Y397-FAK and FAK.
In order to investigate the effect of Y15 on
autophosphorylated and total FAK expression Western
blotting was performed with Y397-FAK and FAK
antibodies in TPC1, BCPAP, K1 and TT cell lines. In each

Y15 inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent
manner in all thyroid cancer cell lines
Next we evaluated the effect of FAK inhibitor,
Y15, on cell viability. MTS assay was completed using
a range of Y15 doses on all cell lines (TT, K1, BCPAP,
and TPC1, respectively).Y15 inhibited cell viability in
a dose-dependent manner across all thyroid cell lines
evaluated (Figure 3A). The medullary cell line, TT, was
most sensitive, with significant inhibition of viability after

Figure 2: Y15 decreased pY397 FAK and FAK expression in a dose-dependent manner in thyroid cancer cell
lines. Western blot demonstrated Y15 decreased expression of phosphorylated and total FAK in four thyroid cancer cell lines in a dosedependent manner. (A) In medullary cell line TT Y397-FAK expression effectively decreased at 3 μM with Y15 treatment. In papillary cell
lines expression of Y397-FAK and FAK is also decreased by Y15: in TPC1 at 30 μM (B), in K1 at 50 μM (C), and in BCPAP at 40 μM (D).
(E) PF-04554878 decreased less pY397 FAK and FAK expression than Y15. PF-04554878 decreased Y397 FAK/FAK expression in TT,
TPC1, K1, or BCPAP cell lines less than Y15 inhibitor.

3 μM Y15 treatment, compared to untreated cells (p<0.05).
Papillary cell line, K1, also demonstrated statistically
significant inhibition of viability when treated with Y15
above 3 μM dose, but only showed small decreases with
higher doses. BCPAP and TPC1 cell viabilities were
significantly inhibited with Y15 treatment at the 5 and
6 μM dose, respectively. In conclusion, Y15 inhibited
viability in all four thyroid cancer cell lines in a dosedependent manner.
IC50 values of each cell line were calculated as
described in Materials and Methods and are shown in
Figure 3B (Figure 3B). IC50 values allow determination
of sensitivity by cell viability of these cells to Y15: in
decreasing sensitivity order TT, TPC1, BCPAP, and K1
that was consistent with decreased Y397-FAK levels by
Y15 in these cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In addition we tested cell viability with
PF-04554878 in MTS assays with the same four cell
lines (Figure 3C). PF-04554878 decreased cell viability
in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines, but in
most cell lines at higher doses compared with Y15
treatment. IC50 concentrations were also calculated for
PF-04554878. IC50 values for TT was 1.98, TPC1
was 23.04, K1 was 10.34 and BCPAP was >50 μM
(Figure 3B). TPC1 and BCPAP cell lines were more
resistant to PF-04554878 than Y15 and decreased Y397FAK less with PF-04554878 than Y15 (Figure 2E).
Thus, TPC1 and BCPAP thyroid cell lines are more
sensitive to Y15 than to PF-04554878 inhibitor, K1 cells
are more sensitive to PF-04554878, and TT cells have
similar sensitivities to both inhibitor suggesting different
mechanisms of both inhibitors.

Y15 increased detachment in each cell line in a
dose-dependent manner

Y15 decreased clonogenicity in papillary thyroid
cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner

In order to understand the mechanism of Y15 and
its role on FAK function in thyroid cells, the detachment
assays were completed with Y15 treatment. Each cell
line was treated with an increasing concentration of
Y15 and detachment of these cells was evaluated. All
cell lines demonstrated increased detachment with
Y15 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4).
The medullary cell line, TT, was most sensitive to Y15
treatment with >90% detachment at over 5 μM Y15,
which is consistent with low IC50 concentration and
Y397-FAK in response to Y15. The papillary cell lines;
BCPAP, K1 and TPC1; had >90% detachment at higher
doses: 50-100 μM. In summary, Y15 caused effective
dose-dependent detachment in all thyroid cancer cell
lines.

To further evaluate the effect of FAK inhibition on
the papillary thyroid cell lines (K1, BCPAP and TPC1),
clonogenicity assay was performed with Y15 treatment.
Y15 caused decreased colony formation in each cell line
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A). K1 demonstrated
the least response, with over 50% colony inhibition at
8 μM Y15, which is consistent with this cell line having
the highest IC50 value by MTS assay. BCPAP was the cell
line that showed the most response with inhibition of over
50% of colonies at 3 μM Y15. TPC1 cells demonstrated
a response in between, with over 50% inhibition of
colonies at 5 μM Y15. The colony counts were graphed to
better visualize the difference between the three cell lines
(Figure 5B). Thus, Y15 caused dose-dependent decrease of
colony formation in all papillary thyroid cancer cell lines.

In addition, we tested the effect of PF-04554878
inhibitor on clonogenicity in TPC1 and K1 papillary
thyroid cancer cells. In both cell lines PF-04554878
decreased colony growth. Complete colony inhibition
was found in 6 μM and 8 μM in TPC1 and K1, respectively
(Figure 5C). Thus, PF inhibitor also effectively dosedependently decreased colony formation in papillary
thyroid cancer cell lines.

50 μM 86%, 76.9%, and 68.7% necrosis, respectively
compared to minimal levels in untreated control cells
(0.82%, 1.61%, and 0.38%) (Figure 6B). Thus, Y15
caused a dose-dependent increase in cell death in all
thyroid cell lines.

Y15 treatment increased necrosis in papillary
and medullary thyroid cancer cell lines

In order to detect and compare gene changes in
response to Y15 treatment between cell lines, microarray
assay was performed in untreated and Y15 treated
papillary thyroid cell lines. The heat map of significant
gene changes by Y15 in TPC1, BCPAP and K1 cell
lines are shown in Figure 7A (Figure 7A). Distinct gene
changes over two-fold were found in TPC1, BCPAP,
and K1 cell lines with Y15 treatment as seen in the heat
maps (Figure 7B). The overlap between genes changed
was relatively small with only 13 genes changed over
two-fold that were changed in TPC1, BCPAP and
K1. The gene expression changes in response to Y15
common among TPC1, BCPAP, and K1 cell lines are
shown in Table  S1. The unique genes significantly
changed in Y15 treated TPC1 cells are listed in
Table  S2. Similarly, genes significantly changed in
Y15-treated K1 and BCPAP cells are listed in Table S3

Papillary thyroid cancer cell lines have common
and unique gene changes in response to Y15

Next, we analyzed cell death effects of Y15 in
thyroid cancer cell lines by Annexin staining. Cells were
treated with increasing doses of Y15 and apoptosis assay
was performed with Annexin V/7AAD staining by flow
cytometry. The necrosis increased in a dose dependent
manner. As demonstrated previously in the MTS assay,
the medullary cell line, TT, was most sensitive to
Y15 treatment as seen in the lower doses of Y15 that
were used. These results demonstrated an increase
of cell death even at the lowest dose of Y15 (5 μM),
inducing cell death in 45.33% of TT cells (Figure 6A).
Conversely, the three papillary cell lines, TPC1, BCPAP,
and K1, when treated with higher concentrations of Y15
induced statistically significant, p <0.05, necrosis at

found at 50 μM doses in TPC1, BCPAP, and K1. *p<0.05 by Student’s t-test.

Y15 induced gene changes distinct from those
induced by PF-04554878

and Table S4. Conversely there were 317, 59, and 36
specific genes changed over two-fold in each TPC1,
BCPAP, and K1 respectively. There were significantly
less genes changed over four-fold in these treatment
groups with 44, 2, and 3 genes changed in each TPC1,
BCPAP, and K1 respectively and 5 genes shared among
two out of three cell lines (Figure 7C). To validate the
gene changes detected in the microarray study, RTPCR (Figure 7D) and Western blotting (Figure 7E)
was used with several genes. The increased heat-shock
HSPA1B gene expression was detected by microarray
and RT-PCR. HSPA1B was found to change 3.7 fold
with Y15 treatment by RT-PCR validating the 1.5
fold increase by microarray analysis (Figure 7D). The
decreased expression of BIRC5, encoding survivin, in
TT and BCPAP cells with Y15 was found by microarray
and was validated by Western blotting (Figure 7E).
Decreased expression of THBS1 and CD44, a cancer
stem cell marker, in TPC1 and BCPAP cells with Y15
that were detected by microarray were also validated
by Western blotting (Figure 7E, left and middle panels).
Additionally unchanged or not significantly changed
expression of THBS1 and CD44 expression with Y15
in resistant K1 cells were found by microarray and were
also detected and validated with Western blot (Figure
7E, right panels). Thus, we validated gene expression
levels and detected common and unique gene changes
in all three cell lines in response to Y15 (Supplemental
Tables 1-4).

Since Y15 and PF-04554878 had similar
sensitivities in TT cells by MTT assay, but different
levels of Y397FAK and FAK expression in response
to these inhibitors (Figure 2E), we used microarray
analysis to analyze the differences in gene expression
in response to two inhibitors. We performed microarray
gene expression profiling study in TT cells treated with
Y15 and PF-04554878, as well as untreated cells, and
compared the gene expression profiles. Gene changes
within each treatment group overall are shown in a

with Cabozantinib, Sorafenib, Pazopanib, and Sunitinib
at low doses. Bliss synergism with combination index of
0.43 was detected with 5 μM Y15 and 10 μM Cabozantinib
(Figure  9A). 5 μM Y15 and 5 μM Sorafenib produced
synergy with combination index of 0.86 (Figure 9B).
Synergism was found with very low doses of 1 μM
Y15 with 1 μM Pazopanib and combination index 0.73
(Figure 9C). With slightly higher doses strong synergy was
found with 20 μM Y15 with 20 μM Sunitinib; combination
index was 0.07 Sunitinib (Figure 9D). At lower doses
of Y15 at 10 μM and 1 μM Sunitinib also demonstrated
strong synergy; combination index was 0.14 (Figure 9D).
These combination indexes indicate that Y15 with
Sunitinib has very strong synergism, with Pazopanib has
moderate synergism, with Cabozantinib has synergism,
and with Sorafenib has slight synergism.

Y15 demonstrated synergism in resistant

other targeted therapeutics approved for clinical trials
(Sorafenib, Pazopanib and Sunitinib) in this cell line [4].
To investigate the combinatorial effect of Y15 with a drug
approved for clinical metastatic thyroid cancer treatment,
Cabozantinib was tested with Y15 [10]. MTS assay in the

DISCUSSION

In each cell line pY397 FAK expression decreased with
Y15 treatment in a dose-dependent manner, but to different
degrees, consistent with data in colon cancer [9]. The
medullary cell line TT was most sensitive to pY397 FAK
expression inhibition with Y15. The papillary cell line
BCPAP was the least sensitive and papillary cell lines K1
and TPC1 were intermediately sensitive to Y15 treatment.
Conversely, PF-04554878 did not as significantly decrease
pY397 FAK expression in these cell lines, compared with
Y15. This is in contrast with the previously published
research on PF-04554878, in which pY397 FAK
expression was significantly decreased with the drug in
ovarian cancer cell lines [12]. We observed decreased
AKT in response to PF-04554878 that can be explored
in thyroid cancer cells in the future. Our micro-array
study demonstrated several cross-linked pathways with
AKT, affected by PF04554878 inhibitor. This indicates
PF-04554878 is likely working through a different
mechanism in thyroid cancer cell lines and this previously
undescribed mechanism is causing resistance to treatment.

FAK has previously been shown to be up-regulated
in many cancers, including thyroid [11]. Our lab previously
showed FAK inhibition through drug Y15 decreases cell
viability, clonogenicity and tumor growth in colon cancer
and breast cancer cells. Due to the association of greater
FAK overexpression with more aggressive thyroid tumors,
FAK inhibition is a viable therapeutic strategy, especially
in more aggressive phenotypes [11]. In this study we
for the first time showed the role of FAK inhibitor Y15
in thyroid cancer and compared our results between cell
lines. Compared with breast and colon cancer cells [8, 9],
the medullary cell line was more sensitive to Y15 and
combination treatment. The papillary cell lines were more
resistant to Y15 than colon cancer cells, but more sensitive
than breast cancer cells. This demonstrates that Y15 is
effective in both sensitive and drug resistant cell lines.
In each thyroid cancer cell line FAK and Y397
phosphorylated FAK were expressed in different levels.

We have demonstrated that in thyroid cancer cell lines
PF-04554878 does not decrease pY397 FAK and FAK
as significantly as in other cancers and this is associated
with higher resistance of thyroid cancer cell lines to
PF-04554878. In addition, the PF-04554878 inhibitor can
work more effectively in cancer stem cells and in 3-D
conditions, as was observed by other authors [12]. This
can be explored in future studies in thyroid cancer cells.
The degree to which each papillary thyroid cancer
cell line decreased in cell viability with Y15 treatment
was correlated with the levels of pY397 FAK. The higher
decreased level of Y397-FAK and FAK correlated to a
higher sensitivity to Y15 treatment. Therefore, TT was
the most sensitive and K1 the least, with BCPAP and
TPC1 showing intermediate inhibition of cell viability
with Y15. Because our small molecule inhibitor targets
the Y397 phosphorylation site, it is consistent that it
would cause more of an effect with a relatively higher
amount of phosphorylated FAK. The medullary cell
line was highly sensitive to both Y15 and PF-04554878
suggesting different signaling versus papillary cell lines in
this type of thyroid cancer. Two out of the three papillary
cell lines, TPC1 and BCPAP, were more sensitive to Y15
than PF-04554878; the last papillary cell line, K1, was
more sensitive to PF-04554878. This indicates the two
FAK inhibitors effect cancer cells through a different
mechanism. Y15 was also shown to increase detachment
and decrease clonogenicity in each cell line in a dosedependent manner. PF-04554878 decreased clonogenicity
in two papillary thyroid cancer cell lines to a greater
degree than Y15. This can be explained by a slower shortterm mechanism of action for PF-04554878 that does not
show as much effect in 24 hour experiments, but appears
in a two week clonogenicity assay.
The mechanism by which Y15 exerted these effects
was shown to be through a combination of apoptosis and
necrosis. Necrosis was detected at the highest doses, but
a lower highest dose likely would have shown continued
increase in apoptosis. Likely at the highest dose, the
necrosis is induced as was shown in breast cancer cell
line BT474 [8]. Y15 increased detachment and decrease
clonogenicity through an apoptotic mechanism in colon
cancer, as we found here in thyroid cancer [9]. Thus,
Y15 can work through apoptosis/necrosis in thyroid
cancer cells.
To investigate the mechanism of Y15 in the
papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines a microarray
gene profile was obtained and compared between cell
lines. There were some gene overlaps between genes
changed with Y15 in the three cell lines, but none over
4-fold in all three lines. This indicates that each cell
line has different protective mechanisms in response
to Y15 treatment or the common responses induce
small gene changes. BCPAP, TPC1, and K1 cell lines
are genetically distinct cell lines from papillary thyroid
tumors with varying mutations [13]. For example,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BCPAP has BRAF and p53 mutations. K1 has the
same BRAF mutation as BCPAP cell line, a PI3KCA
mutation, and a different p53 mutation [14]. TPC1
has the RET/PTC1 rearrangement and does not share
any mutations with the other papillary cell lines [14].
Different mutations can explain different significant
gene changes with Y15 in these cell lines. There were
genes involved in the cell cycle that were up-regulated,
including ASNS and GDF15 as well as genes involved
in apoptosis, including PPP1R15A and BEX2. These
gene changes could explain the apoptotic mechanism
of Y15. Also multiple genes involved in mitosis were
down regulated including ASPM, CENPA, and CENPF,
consistent with previously shown role of FAK in the
nucleus [15]. Interestingly HAS3, the gene encoding
hyaluronan synthase 3, was down-regulated 2.04 fold
by Y15 in TPC1 cells. Previously it was shown that dual
FAK and HAS3 inhibition caused synergistic inhibition
of colon cancer cell viability [16]. The down-regulation
of HAS3 by Y15 confirms that these work though an
overlapping mechanism.
A member of the heat shock family, HSPAIB, was
up-regulated 3.32 fold in TPC1 cells. Heat shock proteins
are a major part of the stress response and were previously
also found to be increased with Y15 treatment in colon
cancer cells [16]. This indicates heat shock proteins are
also involved in avoiding apoptosis in the TPC1 cell line,
possibly as a mechanism of resistance to drug treatment.
In the K1 cell line, numerous chemokine ligands were upregulated with Y15 treatment. Chemokine ligands have
been shown to be increased during the development of
papillary thyroid tumors [17]. The K1 cell line has shown
increased resistance to Y15 treatment and up-regulation
of chemokine ligands is likely an indication of activating
a tumorigenic response to counteract treatment. In the
BCPAP cell line, many genes involved in inflammation
and the immune response were up-regulated. One of these,
IL1B, has been shown to increase CCL2 in follicular
thyroid carcinoma, leading to lymph node metastasis [18].
Up-regulation of these genes likely indicates resistance to
Y15 treatment and targeting these pathways in addition to
Y15 could lead to an increased response and will be tested
in subsequent studies.
To compare and contrast the mechanisms of action
for Y15 and PF-04554878 we identified common and
specific genes changed by both in the medullary thyroid TT
cell line. Multiple kinesins were down-regulated by both
drugs, including KIF11, KIF20A, and KIF 4A. Kinesins
are involved in multiple cellular processes, including
mitosis and intracellular transport, and drugs targeting
kinesins are in clinical trials for treatment of cancer [19].
Multiple kinesins are involved in the development of
cancer, including KIF11 and KIF4A, which were downregulated by both FAK inhibitors. The kinesin pathway
could be one mechanism through which PF-04554878 and
Y15 interact to synergistically inhibit thyroid cancer.

Both Y15 and PF-04554878 also up-regulated
encoding of AEN, apoptosis enhancing nuclease, in TT
cells; Y15 by two-fold and PF-04554878 by three-fold.
AEN is directly induced by p53 and subsequently acts
to induce apoptosis [20]. Up-regulation of AEN by Y15
and PF-04554878 explains both the apoptotic mechanism
through which Y15 works and the synergism with
PF-04554878 on cell viability. Gene changes of AEN and
the kinesin family could indicate the mechanism through
which Y15 causes its effects on cells and through which it
synergizes with PF-04554878.
Also among genes involved in apoptosis,
GADD45A, GADD45B, and GADD45G, were
up-regulated with Y15 in the TT cell line. These genes
were up-regulated significantly 2.73 to 3.42  times,
while they were not changed significantly with
PF-04554878 treatment. GADD45G is similarly decreased
in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and expression of the
gene induces apoptosis [20]. GADD45 proteins activate
the JUN pathway as a stress response and regulate cell
growth and apoptosis [21]. Our findings were consistent
with this as we found JUN to also be increased with Y15
treatment 7.77 fold. This supports Y15 working through an
apoptotic mechanism and control of cell death represents
an effective treatment strategy.
The expression of BIRC5 gene that encodes survivin
was decreased with Y15 treatment. BIRC5 was decreased
0.49-fold in Y15 treated TT cells, while it was statistically
significantly increased 1.26-fold by PF-04554878.
Survivin is expressed highly in thyroid cancer tumors and
associated with metastasis and a worse prognosis [22].
Survivin blocks both the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
and the death receptor pathway for an anti-apoptotic
effect. Again, this indicates Y15 works through multiple
genes that PF-04554878 does not to induce apoptosis.
These genes changes signify Y15 and PF-04554878 work
through a distinct mechanism, but the similar classes of
genes changed and shared genes could explain the synergy
with combination of the drugs.
We also demonstrated synergy of Y15 and
PF-04554878 in TT cells. PF-04554878, now known
as Defactinib, is currently undergoing clinical trials in
multiple cancers including mesothelioma, ovarian and
lung. PF-04554878 was shown to decrease tumor volume
in a chemotherapy-resistant ovarian tumor model through
decreased AKT and YB-1 phosphorylation [12]. FAK is
also involved in the AKT survival pathway that is downstream of the Y397 site and this is a possible mechanism
for the synergistic effect on thyroid cancer of Y15 and
PF-04554878. The detected differences among Y15 and
PF-04554878 inhibitors and common genes by microarray
expression also can explain the synergistic effect.
In this report, for the first time, synergy was
demonstrated with Y15 and Cabozantinib, Sorafenib,
Pazopanib, and Sunitinib in the most resistant cell
line, K1. Papillary thyroid cancer cell line K1 has a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BRAF mutation, a PI3KCA mutation, and a p53 mutation
[14]. The presence of a BRAF mutation confers a worse
prognosis in patients, correlating our finding of resistance
to Y15 [4]. These targeted drugs Cabozantinib, Sorafenib,
Pazopanib, and Sunitinib all inhibit VEGFR, among other
tyrosine kinases. FAK and VEGFR both interact with
integrins and Src and FAK inhibition prevents vascular
permeability induced by VEGFR [21], therefore it would
be expected that drugs targeting VEGFR would synergize
with a FAK inhibitor.
This study indicates that FAK inhibition through
Y15 causes dose-dependent decreases in cell viability,
clonogenicity, and attachment through an apoptotic and
necrotic mechanism that synergizes with current and
investigational therapeutics and this inhibition is related
to the relative amount of active FAK in each cell line.
The study identified common and unique pathways in
response to Y15 in three cell lines and detected differences
and common pathways between Y15 and PF-04554878
inhibitor. Future experiments are needed to further
characterize the mechanism through which Y15 causes its
apoptotic effects.
