rising. Unresectable or metastatic HCC carries a poor prognosis, and systemic
therapy with cytotoxic agents provides marginal benefit. Because of the poor
track record of systemic therapy in HCC, there has been a sense of nihilism for
this disease in the oncology community for decades. However, with the arrival of

advanced HCC. In this review, I have attempted to
summarize concisely the current status of molecularly targeted agents that are under clinical development in advanced HCC.

Key Pathways in Hepatocarcinogenesis Defining the
Targets
Improved understanding of the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis, coupled with the arrival of many
newly developed, molecularly targeted agents, has
provided the opportunity to study some of these
novel agents in advanced HCC. Among the key pathways in carcinogenesis proposed by Hanahan and
Weinberg,7 alterations are observed in nearly every
carcinogenic pathway in HCC. Several excellent
reviews have summarized the state of knowledge of
the most common and important molecular aberrations in HCC.8–11 There are several perceived challenges in assessing the relevant molecular targets in
HCC. First, despite many aberrant alterations observed in HCC, it remains difficult to assess which
pathway is pathogonomotic for HCC. Second, it is
well known that HCC is heterogeneous and has dif-

ferent underlying etiologies. Therefore, it is conceivable that the relevant significance of molecular
alterations may differ depending on the underlying
risk factors. Third, the animal models used to study
HCC, in general, have limitations, in that they cannot
recapitulate many of the key features observed in
human hepatocarcinogenesis. Last, many of the molecular changes observed in HCC may be attributed
to underlying cirrhosis or to dysplastic nodules. Of
all the newly developed, molecularly targeted agents,
those that target angiogenesis and epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) pathways have gained
the most experience in advanced HCC and are the
focus of this review (Fig. 1).

Antivascular Endothelial Growth Factor/Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Agents
Tumor angiogenesis is a complex and dynamic process involving factors that are essential for the development of new tumor blood vessels, tumor growth,
and metastasis. HCCs are vascular tumors, and
increased levels of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and microvessel density have been

252

observed.12–15 High VEGF expression has been associated with inferior survival.16–18 Therefore, inhibition
of angiogenesis represents a potential therapeutic
target in HCC, and several antiangiogenic agents
have entered clinical studies in HCC.

Phase III Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment
Randomized Protocol Trial

Sorafenib
Given the complex, diverse signaling pathways
involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, molecularly targeted agents that have multiple modes of action and
thereby target multiple signaling pathways/effectors
concurrently appear to be very attractive. Sorafenib
(BAY 43-9006; Nexavar, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, West
Haven, Conn) is an oral multikinase inhibitor that
blocks tumor cell proliferation by targeting the Raf/
mitgen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signalregulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) signaling pathway
and exerts an antiangiogenic effect by targeting the
tyrosine kinases (TKs) VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2),
VEGFR-3, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
b (PDGFR-b).19,20 In preclinical models, evidence of
dose-dependent activity against a wide range of tumor types, including HCC, was observed.20,21 Sorafenib exhibited growth-inhibitory effects, induction of
apoptosis, and down-regulation of the antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1 through an Raf/MEK/ERK-independent
mechanism. In tumor xenograft models, sorafenib
inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner; and, at a dose of 100 mg/kg, it produced partial
tumor regression in 50% of treated mice.
In a phase 2 study in patients with advanced,
inoperable HCC (n 5 137), single-agent sorafenib
given at a dose of 400 mg twice daily induced a partial response (PR) in 2.2% of patients, a minor
response in 5.8% of patients, and stable disease (SD)
that lasted 4 months in 34% of patients.22 In that
study, the median time to progression (TTP) was 4.2
months, and the median OS was 9.2 months. Tumor
necrosis was observed in some patients with
increased tumor size. Sorafenib was fairly tolerated.
Grade 3 and 4 drug-related toxicities included fatigue
(9.5%), diarrhea (8%), and hand-foot skin reaction
(5.1%). Treatment was discontinued because of
adverse events in only 7% of patients. In a small
group of patients (n 5 33), pretreatment tumor
phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels were correlated
with the TTP and patients who had tumors that
expressed more intense pERK staining had a longer
TTP. Whether this marker will prove to be predictive
of response needs to be validated in future larger
studies.
Encouraged by the strong rationale for the mechanism of action of sorafenib, preclinical data indicating its action against HCC, and early evidence of

antitumor activity from the phase 2 study, the international, phase 3, placebo-controlled ‘Sorafenib HCC
Assessment Randomized Protocol’ (SHARP) trial was
conducted.6 For that study, 602 patients with
advanced HCC who had received no prior systemic
therapy were evaluated and randomized to receive
either sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (n 5 299) or placebo (n 5 303). The key eligibility criteria included
biopsy-proven HCC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status from 0 to 2, ChildPugh Class A cirrhosis, the presence of measurable
disease, and the receipt no prior regimen. The primary objectives of the study were OS and the time to
symptomatic progression, which were determined by
using the Functional Assessment in Cancer Hepatobiliary Symptom Index Time to Symptom Progression
(FSHI-8-TSP) scoring system. The secondary objective was time to tumor progression. The study had
an impressive accrual rate and completed enrollment
within 13 months. Of the patients enrolled, approximately 50% had either hepatitis C virus or hepatitis
B virus as underlying etiology, and 26% had alcoholrelated cirrhosis. Patients with underlying Child-Pugh
Class A cirrhosis accounted for 95% and 98% of
patients in the sorafenib and placebo groups, respectively. On the basis of the presentation at the 2007
Annual Meeting of the ASCO, the efficacy data are
summarized in Table 1. Similar to prior phase 2 experience, only 7 patients (2.3%) achieved a PR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) in the sorafenib arm. The median
OS was 46 weeks in sorafenib-treated patients compared with 34 weeks in patients who received pla-

Sorafenib and Targeted Agents in HCC/Zhu

cebo, indicating a 44% increase in OS (hazard ratio,
0.69; P 5 .00058). The median TTP was 24 weeks in
sorafenib-treated patients compared with 12 weeks
in patients who received placebo, indicating a 73%
prolongation in the TTP (hazards ratio, 0.58;
P 5 .000007).
Sorafenib represents the first agent that has
shown improved OS benefits in patients with
advanced HCC, and it has validated the use of molecularly targeted agents in this disease. Several unusual aspects of study design were used in the
SHARP trial. The control arm used best supportive
care, which would have been difficult for enrollment
in the U.S., as reflected by the low accrual rate in
North America of only 9%. In addition to OS, the
study used another primary endpoint of the time to
symptomatic progression, which had not been validated in HCC in prior studies and did not reach statistical difference in the SHARP study. Patients were
continued on treatment until both radiographic progression and progression according to the FSHI-8TSP were achieved. Because symptomatic progression was defined by using an instrument that had
not been validated, this may have resulted in some
patients remaining on the study for a longer time
than would have been the case if a more standard
endpoint of radiographic progression alone had been
used. The toxicity profiles seemed to be more favorable than prior experience with sorafenib in other
studies, raising concern regarding toxicity grading
and compliance. In addition, until the final publication of the study, we still are waiting for the ongoing
analyses and clarification of some aspects of the
study. Given the seemingly balanced number of
patients with SD in both arms and the low response
rate according to RECIST criteria, it would be informative to know how many patients have achieved
minor responses in both arms. The numbers of
patients requiring dose reduction of sorafenib were
not presented. No information on the changes in serum a-fetoprotein levels was provided, raising the
ongoing debate regarding the value of this marker in
HCC. Despite these limitations, the SHARP study
does establish the first new standard for the treatment of advanced HCC.
However, it also leaves several unanswered questions and presents new challenges in this field.
Because most patients enrolled had underlying
Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis, it remains uncertain
what would be the relative safety and tolerability for
sorafenib in patients with worsening underlying cirrhosis. What are the molecular and clinical predictors
of clinical benefits of sorafenib? What are the potential mechanisms of action that lead to the sorafenib-

253

mediated clinical benefits? Is this because of the
VEGFR blockage or inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling pathway? How should we incorporate quality-of-life and symptomatic improvement assessment
in future studies? Would sorafenib be beneficial in
the adjuvant setting after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), surgical resection, or liver transplantation? How do we
rationally combine other biologic and cytotoxic
agents with sorafenib to further improve efficacy?

Sunitinib
Sunitinib (SU11248, Sutent; Pfizer, Inc., New York,
NY) is a rationally designed small molecule that inhibits members of the split-kinase domain family of receptor TKs (RTKs) including VEGFR types 1 and 2
(fms-related TK 1 [FLT1] and the FLK1 kinase insert
domain receptor [FLK1/KDR]); PDGFR-a and PDGFR-b,
the stem cell factor receptor c-KIT, and the FLT3 and
RET kinases.23–25 Inhibition of these RTKs blocks signal transduction, thereby affecting many of the processes involved in tumor growth, progression,
metastasis, and angiogenesis.7 Preclinical studies in
various tumor cell lines have demonstrated that the
antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib are mediated
through VEGFR and PDGFR-b, and sunitinib also has
a direct antitumor effect through KIT and Flt3 in diseases in which these pathways are biologically relevant.26,27 Preclinical models have indicated a more
potent angiogenic effect through the inhibition of
both VEGFR on endothelial cells and PDGFR on pericytes compared with the inactivation of endothelial
cells alone.28 Clinically, sunitinib has good oral bioavailability, linear pharmacokinetics, and a prolonged
half-life for the parent compound SU11248 (approximately 40 hours) and its active N-desethyl metabolite SU012662 (approximately 80 hours). Sunitinib
has been approved for the treatment of renal cell
carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor
and has shown antitumor activity in several other
malignancies.
Two independent phase 2 studies have examined
the tolerability and efficacy of sunitinib in patients
with advanced HCC. We treated patients with
advanced HCC by using sunitinib at 37.5 mg orally
once daily on a standard 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off
regimen (6-weeks cycle).29 The primary endpoint of
the study was progression-free survival (PFS). Of the
26 patients enrolled, 1 patient had a PR response of
10 months’ duration, and an additional 10 patients
(38.5%) had SD that lasted 12 weeks. The median
PFS in this cohort was 4.1 months. We also assessed
changes in angiogenic parameters, including tumor
permeability, using dynamic contrast-enhanced mag-

netic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and plasma
angiogenic markers measured by enzyme-linked
immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) and Meso-Scale
Discovery multiplex ELISA. Tumor permeability
(Ktrans) decreased by an average of 38% after 2
weeks of treatment with sunitinib among the 20
patients who were analyzed. The majority of patients
had decreased levels of soluble VEGFR2 and
increased placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF
levels from baseline to Day 15 after sunitinib treatment. Sunitinib administered at this dose schedule
can be given safely, with close monitoring, to the
majority of patients with advanced HCC. Adverse
events generally were manageable, and the most
common adverse events included neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of transaminases, fatigue, and skin rash.
In another European/Asian phase 2 study, sunitinib was administered at a dose of 50 mg daily for 4
weeks every 6 weeks to patients with unresectable
HCC.30 The primary endpoint of the study was the
overall response rate according to RECIST criteria. Of
the 37 patients enrolled, 1 patient had a confirmed
PR, and 39% of patients had SD as their best
response. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia (43%), neutropenia (24%), central nervous
system symptoms (24%), asthenia (22%), and hemorrhage (14%). Dose reductions were required in 27%
of patients. Four patients developed grade 5 events,
including ascites, edema, bleeding, drowsiness, and
hepatic encephalopathy. Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) data do not suggest any differences in
drug exposure between patients with underlying
Child-Pugh Class A or Class B cirrhosis.
It is interesting to note that tumor necrosis was
observed in a significant number of patients after
sunitinib treatment in both studies. How to quantify
the degree of tumor necrosis and to assess whether
tumor necrosis indeed correlates with clinical efficacy remain to be defined in future studies. On the

basis of the preliminary experience, sunitinib appears
to have more toxicities and side effects in patients
with HCC compared with prior experiences in other
tumor types. How to define the optimal tolerable
treatment dose schedule, select the right population
to treat, and confirm the efficacy of sunitinib in
larger studies remain some of the challenges in
future development of this agent in HCC.

Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc., South San
Francisco, Calif), a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, has emerged as an
important therapeutic agent in several malignancies.31 In addition to its direct antiangiogenic effects,
bevacizumab may enhance chemotherapy administration by ‘‘normalizing’’ tumor vasculature and
decreasing the elevated interstitial pressure in
tumors.32,33 Several studies have explored the use of
bevacizumab either as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic or molecularly targeted agents in
patients with advanced HCC (Table 2).
Schwartz et al. reported their preliminary experience using single-agent bevacizumab in HCC in a
phase 1 study.34 Two dosages of bevacizumab, 5 mg/
kg and 10 mg/kg administered intravenously once
every 2 weeks, were tested in patients with HCC who
had no overt extrahepatic metastases or invasion of
major blood vessels. Of the initial 25 patients who
were evaluable for efficacy, 2 patients had a PR, and
18 patients had SD. The median TTP was 6.5 months
(range, 3.9–24.2 months). Malka et al. recently
reported their early experience using bevacizumab as
a single agent in HCC in a phase 2 study.35 Among
the 24 patients who were evaluable for efficacy, 3
patients (12.5%) had a PR, and 7 patients (29%) had
SD that lasted at least 16 weeks.
The combination of bevacizumab with cytotoxic
agents also was evaluated in 3 phase 2 studies. We
completed a phase 2 study using bevacizumab in

Sorafenib and Targeted Agents in HCC/Zhu

combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
(GEMOX-B) in patients with advanced HCC.36 For
Cycle 1 (14 days), bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/
kg was administered intravenously alone on Day 1.
For Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles (28 days), bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg was administered
on Days 1 and 15, and gemcitabine at a dose of
1000 mg/m2 was delivered intravenously as a doserate infusion at 10 mg/m2/minute followed by oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m2 as a 2-hour intravenous
infusion on Days 2 and 16 of every cycle. This regimen had moderate antitumor activity in HCC with
an overall response rate of 20% in evaluable patients.
An additional 27% of patients had SD with a median
duration of 9 months (range, 4.5–13.7 months). The
median OS was 9.6 months, the median PFS was 5.3
months, and the PFS rate at 3 months and 6 months
approached 70% and 48%, respectively. Sun et al.
recently reported their experience of using bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced HCC.37 In a 21-day
cycle, bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) and oxaliplatin (130
mg/m2) were administered intravenously on Day 1,
and capecitabine (825 mg/m2, twice daily) was administered on Days 1 through 14. Of the evaluable
patients, 3 patients (11%) had a PR, and 21 patients
had SD (78%). The mean PFS was 5.4 months, and
the PFS rates at 3 months and 6 months were 70%,
and 40%, respectively. In another early report, the
combination of bevacizumab and capecitabine was
evaluated in a phase 2 study.38 Capecitabine was
given at a dose of 800 mg/m2 orally twice daily on
Days 1 through 14, and bevacizumab was given at a
dose of 7.5 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 of each
21-day cycle. Of the 25 patients who were evaluable
for efficacy and safety, the overall response rate was
16% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.5–36.1%),
and the disease control rate (complete response
[CR] 1 PR 1 SD) was 60% (95% CI, 38.7–78.9%). The
median OS was 10.7 months (95% CI, 5.3–14.7
months), and the median PFS was 4.1 months (95%
CI, 1.6–6.2 months). The PFS rates at 3 months and 6
months were 64% (95% CI, 45.2–82.8%) and 34%
(95% CI, 15.1–53.2%), respectively.
Thomas et al. reported their early phase 2 experience using the combination of bevacizumab and
erlotinib in patients with advanced HCC.39 Bevacizumab was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously
once every 14 days, and erlotinib was given at a dose
of 150 mg orally daily. Of the 34 patients who were
evaluable for efficacy, 1 patient had a confirmed CR,
and 6 patients had a PR, for a 21% response rate.
The median PFS was 9 months, and the median OS
19 months. The encouraging results from that early

255

study should be confirmed cautiously by an independent study in the future.
Despite the initial safety concerns for bevacizumab use in this population, in particular the risks for
gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombosis, the safety
profiles from the phase 2 studies described above
appeared to be favorable overall. Bevacizumabrelated side effects, including hypertension, bleeding,
and proteinuria, were observed and generally were
manageable. Rare occurrence of small bowel perforation was encountered. Early changes of bevacizumab-induced alterations in angiogenic parameters,
including computed tomography perfusion and DCEMRI scan parameters and circulating endothelial
cells (CECs), also were observed. However, whether
changes in any of these parameters correlate with
treatment response and clinical efficacy remains to
be explored in future studies. On the basis of the
phase 1 and 2 study experiences detailed above, bevacizumab appears to have antitumor activity in HCC
either as a single agent or in combination with other
cytotoxic agents or erlotinib with tolerable safety
profiles. However, because of the nonrandomized
nature, small sample size, and patient selection bias
inherent in single-arm studies, the relative contributions, if any, from chemotherapy regimens (either
GEMOX, capecitabine, or capecitabine-oxaliplatin) or
erlotinib remain unknown and warrant further investigations. Whether bevacizumab eventually will prove
to be beneficial and how it compares with sorafenib
will require additional assessment and validation in
future large, randomized phase 2/3 studies.

AZD2171
AZD2171 (cediranib; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals,
U.K.) is a potent, oral, pan-VEGFR TK inhibitor with
activity against PDGFRs and c-Kit. AZD2171 is a
potent inhibitor of both KDR (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] <0.002 lM) and Flt-1 (IC50 5 0.005
lM) and demonstrates activity against c-kit,
PDGFRb, and Flt-4 at nanomolar concentrations.40
Alberts et al. reported their early experience of the
toxicity and efficacy of AZD2171 from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group phase 2 study in
patients with advanced HCC.41 AZD2171 was given
at a dose of 45 mg orally once daily using a 28-day
treatment cycle. Twenty-eight patients have been
accrued, and 19 patients were evaluable for toxicity.
Of these, 16 patients (84%) developed grade 3 toxicity. Fatigue, hypertension, and anorexia accounted
for the majority of adverse events. Despite a lack of
grade 4 events, a high rate of refusal of further treatment was encountered and apparently was related to
the high rate of grade 3 fatigue. Patients received a

PTK787
PTK787/ZK222584 (Vatalanib; Novartis, East Hanover,
NJ) is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that targets all
known VEGFR TKs, including VEGFR-1/flt-1, VEGFR2/KDR, and VEGFR-3/Flt-4, PDGFR, and c-kit, with a
higher selectivity for VEGFR-2.42,43 Koch et al.
reported the early experience of an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of PTK787 administered
once daily at a dose from 750 mg to 1250 mg in
patients with unresectable HCC.44 Patients were stratified into 3 groups with mild, moderate, and severe
hepatic dysfunction, respectively, based on total bilirubin and aspartate/alanine aminotransferase levels.
The maximal tolerated dose of PTK787 was defined
as 750 mg daily. Among the patients in all 3 groups,
18 patients were evaluable for efficacy. No CR or PR
was observed. Nine patients had a best response of
SD, and 9 patients had progressive disease.
Anti-EGFR Agents
Increasing evidence has highlighted the importance
of EGFR/human EGFR1 (EGFR/HER1) and its ligands
EGF and transforming growth factor-a (TGF-a) in
hepatocarcinogenesis. The expression of several EGF
family members, specifically EGF, TGF-a, and heparin binding-EGF, as well as the EGFR, has been
described in several HCC cell lines and in tissue.45–50
Morimitsu et al. examined the expression of TGF-a
and its receptor, EGFR, in HCC and adjacent nontumorous livers from 25 Japanese patients using
immunohistochemistry.51 TGF-a was detected in 24
of 25 HCCs (96%) and in 23 of 24 (96%) available adjacent nontumorous livers. EGFR was detected in 16

of 25 HCCs (64%) and in 17 of 24 (71%) adjacent
nontumorous liver tissues. Studies have supported
the theory of an autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine
mechanism of TGF-a and EGFR/HER1 on the proliferation of human HCC.52 Multiple strategies to target
EGFR signaling pathways have been developed, and
2 classes of anti-EGFR agents have established clinical activity in cancer: monoclonal antibodies, which
competitively inhibit extracellular endogenous ligand
binding, and small molecules, which inhibit the intracellular TK domain.

EGFR TK inhibitors
Two phase 2 clinical studies have evaluated the
safety and efficacy of erlotinib (Tarceva) given at a
dose of 150 mg daily in patients with advanced HCC
(Table 3).53,54 In the study by Philip et al., 3 of 38
patients (9%) had a PR, and 12 patients (32%) were
progression free at 6 months.53 The median OS for
this cohort was 13 months. In another report by
Thomas et al., 17 of 40 patients (43%) achieved PFS
at 16 weeks, and the PFS rate at 24 weeks was 28%.54
No PR or CR was observed in this study. The median
time to failure, which was defined as either disease
progression or death, was 13.3 weeks. The median
OS was 25.0 weeks (95% CI, 17.9–42.3 weeks) from
the date erlotinib therapy was initiated. In Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group Study E1203, gefitinib
given at 250 mg daily was examined in a single-arm
phase 2 study.55 A 2-stage design was used, and 31
patients were accrued to the first stage. One patient
had a PR, and 7 patients had SD. The median PFS
was 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.5–3.9 months), and the
median OS was 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.4–8.9 months).
The criterion for second-stage accrual was not met,
and the authors concluded that gefitinib as a single
agent was not active in patients with advanced HCC.
Lapatinib, a selective dual inhibitor of both EGFR
and HER-2/NEU TKs, also demonstrated modest ac-

tivity in HCC in a preliminary report.56 Among the
first 17 patients with advanced HCC, 2 patients had
a confirmed PR, and an additional 8 patients had SD.
However, the PFS was only 2.3 months in this cohort.

Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR
Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against
EGFR, was tested in 2 phase 2 studies in patients
with advanced HCC.57 In our study, 30 patients with
advanced HCC were enrolled. The initial dose of
cetuximab was 400 mg/m2 given intravenously followed by weekly intravenous infusions at 250 mg/
m.2 No responses were observed. Five patients had
SD (median time, 4.2 months; range, 2.8–4.2
months). The median OS was 9.6 months (95% CI,
4.3–12.1 months), and the median PFS was 1.4
months (95% CI, 1.2–2.6 months). Cetuximab trough
concentrations were not altered notably in patients
with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Class A and CTP
Class B cirrhosis. Gruenwald et al. reported their preliminary experience of cetuximab in a similarly
designed study in patients with HCC.58 Of the 32
patients who were enrolled, 27 patients were evaluable for efficacy. No responses were observed, and
the median TTP for all patients was 8 weeks.
The combination of cetuximab with GEMOX was
evaluated in a phase 2 study.59 All patients received
cetuximab at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 followed
by 250 mg/m2 weekly, gemcitabine at a dose of 1000
mg/m2 on Day 1, and oxaliplatin at a dose of 100
mg/m2 on Day 2 repeated every 14 days until disease
progression or limiting toxicity. Of the 43 patients
who were enrolled, 35 patients were evaluable for efficacy with a response rate of 23%. Given the known
antitumor activity of GEMOX in prior phase 2 studies
and the lack of activity of cetuximab as a single
agent, the relative contribution of cetuximab to this
regimen remains to be defined.
Challenges in HCC Clinical Trial Design in the
Post-Sorafenib Era
The SHARP study has established sorafenib as the
new reference standard for the treatment of
advanced HCC. Because of this important study, it
has sparked more interest in the development of
other agents in HCC. In addition, it has generated
further challenges in future trial designs. Several
potential phase 2/3 study designs in advanced HCC
are illustrated in Figure 2. The tested new agent/regimen can be compared directly with sorafenib or the
combination of the tested agent and sorafenib can
be compared with sorafenib alone, and the new
agent/regimen can be tested in the sorafenib-refrac-

tory population. Because of the aggressive nature of
HCC and underlying cirrhosis, we should continue to
focus on testing the promising agents/regimens in
patients who have relatively preserved hepatic function and good performance status. Because most
patients who have HCC have underlying cirrhosis
with impaired hepatic function, we should assess the
safety and toxicity profiles of the newer agents/regimens carefully in this population. We should continue with our efforts to develop and validate an
HCC-specific quality-of-life measurement. The efficacy and safety profiles of any new agents/regimens
should be examined vigorously in phase 2, preferably
in randomized phase 2 studies, before rushing for
large phase 3 studies, to ensure the optimal use of
patient resources. While testing the newer molecularly targeted agents in HCC, it is imperative to
incorporate imaging studies and surrogate markers
in an attempt to understand the potential mechanisms of action of these agents.

Future Directions
Despite the important, positive results of improved
OS with sorafenib in the SHARP study, the benefits
are modest. Therefore, developing more effective systemic therapies for patients with HCC remains a
challenge. Future research should continue to unravel the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis and to
identify key relevant molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. We should have a better understanding of the clinical and molecular predictors of
sorafenib-mediated clinical benefits and mechanisms
of resistance. The development and approval of other

258

molecularly targeted agents in this disease should be
expedited. The role of sorafenib and other promising
agents should be examined in the adjuvant setting
after RFA, TACE, surgical resection, or selective settings in liver transplantation in an attempt to
improve further the outcomes of these patients.
Hopefully, we will continue to witness meaningful
progress for the development of molecularly targeted
agents in HCC in the coming years.
