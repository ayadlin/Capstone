BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before chemoradiation therapy (CRT) may improve outcomes for
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, but optimal management remains controversial, and prior reports
have limited follow-up. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with unresectable (n ¼ 46) or borderline resectable
(n ¼ 24) locally advanced pancreatic cancer were treated with CRT from 2005 to 2009. Patients typically received
50.4 grays in 28 fractions (91%) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil (84%) or capecitabine (14%). Forty patients received
CRT alone, and 30 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT for a median of 4 months, typically gemcitabine (93%). All patients without progression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were offered CRT. RESULTS: Median
follow-up was 14.2 months (range, 3-57 months). Fifty-three percent of patients in the CRT group versus 83% in the
neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group had unresectable tumors at diagnosis; after completion of CRT, 20% of
patients in both groups underwent resection. Compared with CRT alone, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT
group demonstrated improved median overall survival (OS; 18.7 vs 12.4 months; P ¼ .02) and progression-free survival
(11.4 vs 6.7 months; P ¼ .02). On multivariate analysis, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (adjusted hazard ratio
[HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.87; P ¼ .02) and surgical resection (adjusted HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.85; P ¼ .02) were
associated with increased OS. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy confers a significant
OS advantage by allowing the selection of patients who will derive greatest benefit from CRT. Median survival with

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with 5-year survival rates of
<5%.1 Surgical resection, which offers the best chance at long-term survival, is feasible in only 10% to 20% of patients.
Nearly half of all patients with pancreatic cancer have metastatic disease at presentation that is radiographically apparent,
and the remaining 30% to 40% of patients present with localized but unresectable disease, which is considered locally
advanced pancreatic cancer. However, even patients with apparently localized disease have a high rate of occult metastases,
with staging laparoscopy studies demonstrating that up to 30% of patients harbor metastatic peritoneal disease that is
undetectable by imaging.2
Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer are commonly treated with upfront chemoradiation therapy (CRT)
in the United States, based on the results of 2 randomized trials by the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group demonstrating superior survival to either chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone.3,4 However, prognosis remains dismal, as patients
with locally advanced pancreatic cancer have a median survival of only 8 to 12 months. Many locally advanced pancreatic

cancer patients develop detectable metastatic disease
shortly after completion of CRT, having thus been
exposed to the acute toxicities of a time-intensive local
therapy presumably without deriving substantial benefit
from the treatment.
The more recent Fédération Francophone de la
Cancérologie Digestive randomized trial highlighted the
importance of systemic therapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer, demonstrating that gemcitabine monotherapy resulted in superior survival for patients with locally
advanced pancreatic cancer compared with sequential
therapy with CRT followed by maintenance gemcitabine.5 Whereas that study added controversy regarding
the benefit of CRT in locally advanced pancreatic cancer,
a contemporaneous report published by the European
Groupe Cooperateur Multidisciplinaire en Oncologie
revealed that locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients
who did not progress after receipt of initial gemcitabine
and went on to receive CRT had significantly longer overall survival (OS) than those who received chemotherapy
alone (15 vs 11.7 months; P ¼ .0009).6 The European
Groupe Cooperateur Multidisciplinaire en Oncologie
study thus suggested that although systemic therapy was
certainly important, there was a subgroup of patients who
may derive a survival benefit from the addition of CRT.
These evolving data led to a gradual shift in management practices for locally advanced pancreatic cancer at
our institution, with more patients receiving upfront gemcitabine-based chemotherapy before CRT. Given that the
optimal management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer remains debated, the aim of our study was to evaluate
outcomes of locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients
treated with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy before
CRT, in a contemporary cohort with long-term followup. In this series, we focus on locally advanced pancreatic
cancer patients who ultimately received CRT, and have
not included patients who may have received initial chemotherapy but did not go on to receive CRT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Seventy consecutive patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer received curative-intent CRT at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2005 and
November 2009. Patient charts were reviewed to collect
baseline data on age, sex, clinical presentation, diagnosis
date, performance status (PS), medical history, and staging information (Table 1). No patients were excluded

from analysis. This investigation was approved by the
institutional review board.
Staging Evaluation
All patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team
including medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists.
Patients underwent pancreatic protocol computed tomography (CT) including an arterial phase, early venous
phase, and delayed venous phase, with thin cuts and coronal reformats, for evaluation of the primary pancreatic
tumor. Tumors involving the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery, or occluding the superior mesenteric vein
or splenoportal confluence, were considered categorically
unresectable. Tumors without complete vessel encasement but with substantial vascular encroachment were
considered borderline resectable, per the surgical oncologist. Tumors considered either unresectable or borderline
resectable, without detectable metastases, were included
for analysis, given that both fall within the spectrum of
locally advanced pancreatic cancer and actual resectability
within these 2 groups is challenging to predict preoperatively. Patients also underwent chest CT and evaluation of
serum tumor markers carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen, and 50% underwent staging
laparoscopy.
Initial Treatment
Among the 70 patients, 30 patients received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy before CRT, whereas the remaining 40
patients received CRT alone (Table 2). Patients in the
neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group received
neoadjuvant gemcitabine in 93% of cases; gemcitabine
monotherapy was generally given as a cycle of 1000 mg/
m2 per week for 3 weeks, then 1 week off. At our institution, all locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients without distant progression on restaging CT scans after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 2, are offered
CRT. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
assessed based on the attending radiologist’s report for the
restaging CT and not according to prespecified response
criteria.
Most patients (64 of 70; 91%) received the median
radiation therapy (RT) dose of 50.4 grays (Gy) in 1.8-Gy
daily fractions, using either 3-dimensional RT (n ¼ 9;
13%) or intensity-modulated RT (n ¼ 61; 87%). The primary tumor plus regional lymph nodes were targeted in
all patients. Concurrent chemotherapy given with RT
included continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil (n ¼ 59;

cal examination, serum marker assessment, and CT imaging. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of
diagnosis to the first event or last known confirmed date
of disease-free status. At progression, patients received
individualized treatment that typically included further
systemic therapy. The primary endpoint was OS, and secondary endpoints were local recurrence, distant metastasis, and progression-free survival (PFS).
Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize clinical
characteristics of the study cohort, stratified by receipt of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Fisher exact test was used to

Original Article

compare categorical variables, and nonparametric k-sample test was used to compare median values of continuous
variables. Actuarial estimates of OS were calculated by the
Kaplan-Meier method7 and compared with log-rank test.
Factors tested in a univariate analysis for association with
survival included patient age, sex, weight loss, tumor location, resectability status at diagnosis, carbohydrate antigen
19-9 at diagnosis and after CRT, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and surgical resection. Cox proportional hazards8
multivariate analysis was used to analyze factors associated
with OS and PFS. All analyses were performed in Stata
11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex). All tests were
2-sided, and P values .05 were considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Median age among all patients was 63 years, and 51%
were male (Table 1). Most patients presented with abdominal or back pain (71%), jaundice (51%), and weight
loss (76%), with a median weight loss of 5.4 kg at diagnosis. Thirty percent carried a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus,
and 97% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Half of all patients
underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings as part of initial staging, including more patients in
the CRT group than the neoadjuvant chemotherapy
before CRT group (65% vs 30%; P ¼ .10). More patients
in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group than
the CRT group were deemed categorically unresectable at
diagnosis (83% vs 53%; P ¼ .01), which was the only significant difference in baseline characteristics between
these groups.
Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
In the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group,
patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for a median
of 4.0 months (range, 1-12 months; Table 2). Partial
response was observed among 30% of patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group, with 63%
having no discernible radiographic response on restaging
imaging before CRT.
Toxicity of Chemoradiation
In the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group,
13% (n ¼ 4) developed grade 3 or higher acute toxicity
requiring hospital admission during chemoradiation, for
diarrhea (n ¼ 1), fever (n ¼ 2), and 5-fluorouracil mucositis (n ¼ 1), compared with 33% (n ¼ 13) in the CRT
group, which was predominantly because of nausea and

3030

dehydration (n ¼ 4) or biliary stent obstruction (n ¼ 4).
Approximately equal numbers of patients between groups
required a treatment break during CRT (27% for neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT, 28% for CRT), for a
median of 5 days. Median weight loss during CRT was
2.7 kg versus 4.5 kg and chemotherapy dose was reduced
during CRT among 17% versus 25% of patients, among
those in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT
group versus CRT group, respectively.
Management After Chemoradiation
After completion of chemoradiation, greater than half of
all patients (53%; 37 of 70) were brought to surgery, with
38% (14 of 37) of these patients undergoing resection
(Table 3). Overall, 20% percent of patients in both treatment groups (n ¼ 6 for neoadjuvant chemotherapy before
CRT, n ¼ 8 for CRT) were able to undergo resection. Of
the 14 patients who underwent resection, 6 patients
(43%; n ¼ 3 in each group) initially had been considered
categorically unresectable before treatment, and the
remaining 8 patients had been considered borderline resectable. Eleven of these 14 patients (79%) had uninvolved surgical margins after resection. For patients whose
tumors were found to be unresectable at surgery, intraoperative RT (IORT) was given; approximately 25% of
patients in both groups received IORT to a median dose
of 17 Gy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT) or 20
Gy (CRT). Adjuvant chemotherapy was received by 40%
of patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT
group, versus 53% in the CRT group, and was gemcitabine based in nearly all cases.
Disease Recurrence and Survival
Median follow-up among all patients was 14.2 months
(range, 3-57 months); no patients were lost to follow-up.
Median OS among all patients was 14.0 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 12.3-16.2 months), and median
PFS was 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.0-10.8 months). Estimated OS at year 1 was 63% (95% CI, 50%-73%) and at
year 2 was 18% (95% CI, 9%-28%). At last follow-up, 57
of the patients (81%) had died, all but 1 from pancreatic
cancer.
Local progression after receiving chemoradiation
occurred among 25% of patients in the CRT group versus
23% of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT
group. Among patients who progressed locally, median
time to progression was 6.4 months (range, 0.2-9.0
months) among CRT patients and 4.1 months (range,
0.6-8.1 months) among neoadjuvant chemotherapy

was 8.3 versus 14.7 months (P ¼ .001).
Predictors of Survival
Significant factors predicting OS and PFS on univariate
and multivariate analyses are shown in Table 4. On multivariate analysis, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.87; P

CI, 0.17-0.85; P ¼ .02) were independently associated
with increased OS. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (adjusted
HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.70; P ¼ .001) and surgical
resection (adjusted HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.56; P ¼
.001) were also associated with increased PFS, whereas
carbohydrate antigen 19-9 value (continuous) after CRT
(adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.29; P ¼ .045) was
associated with decreased PFS.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report long-term outcomes among consecutive patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
who received curative-intent CRT at our institution in the
modern era, and found that gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT was independently associated with a striking increase in OS, similar to the
increase in OS seen with surgical resection.9 Specifically,
the median OS of 18.7 months among patients receiving
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was >6 months longer than
among those not receiving this therapy, just as patients
who underwent resection in our series had a median OS
of 19.4 months, >6 months longer than for those not
receiving resection. These results are particularly notable
given that patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy
before CRT group had significantly more locally
advanced disease, with 83% having categorically unresectable disease at diagnosis compared with 53% in the CRT
group (P ¼ .01). Given that most patients with locally
advanced pancreatic cancer remain unresectable, our findings highlight that neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a means
of selecting patients to receive subsequent CRT may represent 1 of the more promising current approaches for
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
The apparent benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
in locally advanced pancreatic cancer is that it may help
identify patients who have biologically aggressive and presumably occult metastatic disease at presentation. Because
CRT represents a time- and resource-intensive treatment
with significant rates of short-term morbidity, it is important to select patients for CRT who will actually derive
benefit from this locoregional therapy. Whereas the 2

Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group trials demonstrated
a survival benefit for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who received CRT, the recent Fédération
Francophone de la Cancérologie Digestive randomized
trial5 has added controversy regarding the precise role of
CRT for these patients. In that trial, sequential therapy
with CRT followed by maintenance gemcitabine for
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer resulted
in survival inferior to that of patients treated with gemcitabine alone. The RT dose (60 Gy) in that study was higher
than what is typically delivered in conventionally fractionated RT courses, and the concurrent chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) was also nonstandard,
with high rates of treatment-related toxicity. Nonetheless,
the Fédération Francophone de la Cancérologie Digestive
trial demonstrates the need to appropriately select locally
advanced pancreatic cancer patients who may benefit from
CRT, and the biological staging that is afforded by neoadjuvant chemotherapy represents what appears to be a
remarkably effective selection tool. In addition, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve subsequent outcomes
after CRT through effects on the primary tumor,10
including reducing tumor size, and merits further study.
Two prior investigations of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT in locally advanced pancreatic cancer
have demonstrated that sequential therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT may be promising,
although they reported limited follow-up or were in the
context of pooled phase 2-3 data. The European Groupe
Cooperateur Multidisciplinaire en Oncologie study retrospectively examined outcomes of locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients enrolled in 4 prospective trials
investigating different chemotherapeutic regimens, specif-

ically gemcitabine plus either oxaliplatin or 5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin, followed by standard consolidative CRT given
at the discretion of the investigator.6 Results indicated
superior survival for patients receiving neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy compared with those receiving
CRT alone, with median OS in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group of 15 months, although the
length of follow-up was not reported. Patients in this series
had been selected for enrollment on a prospective trial,
and all received doublet chemotherapy, which may limit
the generalizability of their conclusions to comparison
with our data. In addition, a report from The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center published after the
European Groupe Cooperateur Multidisciplinaire en
Oncologie study demonstrated a survival advantage with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT, with the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group having a median
OS of 11.9 months.11 Most patients received doublet neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a more hypofractionated RT
course of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Given that the median
follow-up was only 5.5 months in that study, it is possible
that with longer patient follow-up, median OS would
have been closer to the 18.7 months seen in our data.
Approximately 1=3 of the locally advanced pancreatic
cancer patients in our series were considered borderline resectable at diagnosis, which is variously defined but typically includes locally invasive disease that does not as
extensively involve the vasculature, with shorter segments
of vessel encasement and occlusion or less circumferential
involvement.12 In addition, CT-based staging often
underestimates the true extent of disease found at surgery.13 At our institution, these patients are often considered for preoperative therapy including CRT with or

without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, given that it may
facilitate resection with negative margins.14 We found
that preoperative designation as unresectable versus borderline resectable was not particularly useful in predicting
which patients would be resected, with nearly half of the
patients (6 of 14) who underwent resection having been
initially deemed categorically unresectable. In addition,
our multivariate analysis did not suggest that resectability
status at diagnosis was prognostic for survival. Interestingly, both groups had a favorable 20% resection rate after initial therapy, although significantly more patients in
the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT group had
radiographically unresectable disease at diagnosis. At our
institution, we frequently offer IORT for locally
advanced pancreatic cancer patients found to be unresectable at the time of surgical exploration,15 and although
the option of IORT may in theory increase the likelihood
of a patient with questionably resectable disease going to
the operating room, in practice we found that only 1 of
the 14 patients (7%) who underwent resection was
brought to surgery for the purposes of IORT but had
unexpectedly resectable disease (data not shown). In general, our data would support inclusion of both borderline
resectable and unresectable tumors for consideration of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT, echoing recent
neoadjuvant strategies for patients with clearly resectable16 or borderline resectable17-19 disease.
The primary limitation to our study is that we could
not prospectively capture all the patients with locally
advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer who
started on chemotherapy and later progressed before getting CRT. As outlined, the goal of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer is to allow
for the appropriate selection of patients to receive subsequent CRT. This clearly represents a selection bias. However, all locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients are not
equally suitable to receive CRT, typically based on increasing age or decreased PS,20 and thus there will always be
some degree of selection based on clinical factors in determining appropriate therapy, unless subjects are evaluated
in a prospective trial. It is our practice to offer CRT to all
locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients with an
ECOG PS of 0 to 2 who have not progressed during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our intent in comparing the 2
groups is to highlight the difference in survival at a major
academic cancer center with a long history of pancreatic
cancer clinical research. Given the cost and toxicity of chemoradiation20,21 as well as the unclear efficacy advantage
of immediate chemoradiation,5,22 our results suggest that

3034

locally advanced and borderline resectable patients should
be offered chemotherapy before chemoradiation.
In addition to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy
approach we have described, several other treatment strategies for locally advanced pancreatic cancer continue to
evolve, in an effort to improve survival outcomes. RT
dose intensification is 1 approach, including stereotactic
body RT techniques delivering very high RT doses in a
small number of treatments, with a recent report demonstrating favorable survival when neoadjuvant gemcitabine
was followed by stereotactic body RT for nonprogressors.23 Alternatively, targeted agents including bevacizumab, erlotinib, gefitinib, sorafenib, and cetuximab have
been introduced in the neoadjuvant or concurrent CRT
setting, typically in combination with cytotoxic agents.2430
To date, these approaches appear safe, although some
have shown increased gastrointestinal toxicity, and longer
follow-up is required to determine long-term efficacy.
Several standard cytotoxic agents have also been
used alone or in combination, but with limited success to
date.31-36 However, a recent preplanned interim analysis
of a randomized phase 3 trial by Conroy et al has demonstrated a significant survival improvement with FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, irinotecan, and
oxaliplatin) compared with gemcitabine among metastatic pancreatic cancer patients,37 and there is interest in
evaluating responses to this regimen in the setting of
locally advanced pancreatic cancer.38 Ongoing follow-up
of these multiple treatment approaches will be required to
determine the optimal therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer moving forward.
In summary, with long follow-up we have observed
that a strategy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before CRT
for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer offers
a significant OS advantage similar to that seen with surgical resection. This appears to be a promising approach for
selection of patients who will derive the most benefit from
CRT, and prospective validation is warranted.
