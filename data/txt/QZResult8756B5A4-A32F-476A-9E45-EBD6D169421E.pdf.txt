Are High Drug Prices for Hematologic Malignancies Justified?
A Critical Analysis
Jagpreet Chhatwal, PhD1; Michael Mathisen, PharmD2; and Hagop Kantarjian, MD3

In the past 15 years, treatment outcomes for hematologic malignancies have improved substantially. However, drug prices have also
increased drastically. This commentary examines the value of the treatment of hematologic malignancies at current prices in the
United States through a reanalysis of a systematic review evaluating 29 studies of 9 treatments for 4 hematologic malignancies.
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated on the basis of drug prices in the United States in 2014. Sixty-three percent of the studies (15 of 24) had ICERs higher than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), the benchmark widely used by
health economists to define cost-effectiveness. In studies evaluating the current standard-of-care treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia, the ICERs for tyrosine kinase inhibitors versus hydroxyurea or interferon ranged from $210,000 to $426,000/QALY. The lower
ICER values were mostly obtained from 11 studies evaluating rituximab, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
1997 (ICER range, $37,000-$69,000/QALY). In conclusion, the costs of the majority of new treatments for hematologic cancers are

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 15 years, cancer drug prices have risen drastically. The average price of a cancer drug was $5000 to $10,000
before 2000 and increased to more than $100,000 in 2012.1,2 In that year, 12 of the 13 drugs approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for cancer indications were priced higher than $100,000. In 2014, almost every new cancer drug
approved had a price range between $120,000 and $170,000.
During the same period, the average household income decreased approximately 8% to a median of $52,000.3
Recent trends in insurance coverage have shifted a significant burden of the cost of care to patients, with out-of-pocket
expenses of approximately 20% to 30% for specialty drugs.4 Cancer is estimated to affect 1 in 3 individuals in their lifetime. Many individuals and families will thus face a common, potentially catastrophic situation of a cancer diagnosis
within the family and the need for a cancer treatment, for which the out-of-pocket expense will be approximately $25,000
to 30,000, more than half the average household income. This is more significant for senior citizens, who are disproportionately more affected by cancer and have a lower average income.5
Advances in the understanding of cancer pathophysiologies and in therapies have improved the prognosis for many
cancers and particularly for hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma. However, medical experts have questioned the value of these drugs at their current high prices.6 In a recent systematic review, Saret et al7 assessed the value of innovation in hematologic malignancies by identifying 29 studies published from 1996 to 2012 with the Tufts Medical Center CEA Registry (https://research.tufts-nemc.org/cear4/). These
included 9 treatments (interferon-a, alemtuzumab, bendamustine, thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, dasatinib,
imatinib, and rituximab) for 4 hematologic cancers: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The authors concluded that innovative treatments for hematologic malignancies provide reasonable value for the money in the United States.

High Drug Prices for Hematologic Malignancies/Chhatwal et al

The analysis was based on the costs of the drugs in
past years, which were substantially lower than the current
prices, on studies conducted within and outside the
United States, and on a combination of heterogeneous
cost-effectiveness analyses of different hematologic cancers. Our objective was to update the outcomes of the 29
cost-effectiveness studies through the use of current drug
costs and revisit the conclusions.

the money. For example, the United Kingdom typically
uses £30,000/QALY, and Canada uses $50,000/QALY.10
Although no such threshold exists in the United States,
the majority of the published studies use $50,000/QALY.
Therefore, with the aforementioned metric, we can conclude that drug B is cost-effective in comparison with
drug A, and additional resources spent on drug B provide
a good value for the money.

HOW IS TREATMENT VALUE ANALYZED?
We first describe cost-effectiveness analysis, a commonly
used approach to assess the value of a treatment. Costeffectiveness analysis assesses the incremental benefits and
costs of an intervention in comparison with the old or
existing intervention. A special case of cost-effectiveness
analysis is cost-utility analysis, in which the health benefits
(ie, effects) are typically measured in terms of qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs).8,9 Because these measures
were used in the analysis by Saret et al7 and are critical to
understanding the results and conclusions, we detail them
next in simple terms.
QALY determines both the quality and quantity of
life lived. The quality of life is typically determined by
health state weights, where 1 represents perfect health and
0 represents death. For example, 5 years lived in a perfectly health state will be counted as 5 QALYs (ie, 5 3
1.0), whereas 5 years lived in a morbid condition with a
50% reduction in a patient’s quality of life will result in
2.5 QALYs (ie, 5 3 0.5).
Cost-effectiveness is typically expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the ratio of the
change in costs to the change in effects (eg, QALYs). For
example, consider existing drug A, which results in total
costs of $50,000 (which includes the costs of managing
adverse events) over a patient’s lifetime and in a total of 8.5
QALYs. Suppose new drug B, which costs more and
improves survival, becomes available. The use of drug B
results in total costs of $100,000 and 10.5 QALYs. The
ICER of drug B is calculated as the ratio of $50,000 (ie,
$100,000 – $50,000) to 2.0 (ie, 10.5 – 8.5), which is equal
to $25,000. The ICER value is used to determine whether
a new intervention is cost-effective in comparison with an
existing one. The ICER tells how much more is spent to
gain 1 additional QALY (in this case, $25,000/QALY).
Most developed countries consider a well-defined
willingness-to-pay threshold, which indicates how much
of a maximum price a payer is willing to pay to gain an
additional QALY. If the ICER of an intervention is below
the willingness-to-pay threshold, the intervention is
deemed cost-effective; that is, it provides a good value for

REANALYSIS OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS
STUDIES
Saret et al7 evaluated the 29 studies listed in Table 1.11-39
They addressed the cost-effectiveness of drugs approved
between 1986 and 2006 (median year of Food and Drug
Administration approval, 2001) in studies published
between 1995 and 2012 (median year of publication,
2006). Notably, 21 of the 29 analyzed studies (72%) were
industry-funded; 24 of 29 (83%) were conducted before
2011; and 18 of the 29 studies (62%) were conducted
outside the United States (United Kingdom, Canada,
France, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Norway) and used
the price of drugs in the year of the study in the particular
geographic area.7
The primary concern with the analysis7 is the price
of the treatment used to measure cost-effectiveness and
reach conclusions. In the analysis, the authors did not
adjust for the updated drug costs from the year of the original modeling study. For example, the ICER related to
imatinib from the studies published in 2001 and 2005
was based on the price of imatinib in the United States in
2001 ($26,000 per year of therapy) and the price of imatinib in the United Kingdom in 2005 ($50,000 per year of
therapy). However, the price of imatinib in 2014 was
$132,000 per year of therapy (average wholesale price
from RED BOOK [accessed January 15, 2015]). The drug
prices from past years should not be used to justify cancer
drug prices in 2014.
Second, the price of the drug from countries outside the United States was used to justify a reasonable
treatment value in the United States. The prices of cancer drugs are 20% to 70% lower in Canada and European countries in comparison with the United States
(Table 2).40 Eighteen of the 29 studies were performed
outside the United States. Non-US cost-effectiveness
analyses may not reflect cancer drug prices in the
United States.
In our analysis, we updated the ICERs of these studies by using the US drug prices in 2014. We excluded 9
studies31-39 for the following reasons: 1) 3 studies compared interferon-a with hydroxyurea or the addition of

details for recalculating the ICER in 2014.39 We were left
with 20 studies and 24 cost-effectiveness analyses.
We updated the ICERs of each study by 1 of 2
methods. With the first method, we updated the
ICERs with the reported sensitivity analysis of drug
costs in the original cost-effectiveness study. For
example, if the original study reported ICERs at lower
and upper values of drug costs, we used the linear
relation between ICERs and drug costs to find the
updated ICER at 2014 drug costs. Alternatively, we
Cancer

October 1, 2015

updated the reported total cost of treatment from the
published decision analytic model with 2014 drug
costs and recalculated the ICERs. We converted nonUS currencies to US dollars with the historic
exchange rates appropriate for each study. Finally, we
updated all costs to 2014 with the Consumer Price
Index.41
Table 1 shows the reported ICERs and the recalculated ICERs in dollars per QALY as the real treatment values in 2014. As shown in Figure 1, the ICERs (dollars per
QALY) in 2014 were mostly several-fold higher than
those calculated in the original studies. For example, in
the 5 CML studies, the ICER values for tyrosine kinase
inhibitors versus hydroxyurea or interferon ranged from
$210,000 to $426,000/QALY and exceeded the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/
QALY. The only exception was the comparison of dasatinib with imatinib (800 mg daily) for CML salvage, but
the comparator was an artificially expensive one (double
the standard dose of imatinib) that is not considered a reasonable treatment by some CML experts. Figure 2 shows
that 63% (15 of 24) of the studies had ICERs higher than
$50,000/QALY. Most of the lower ICER values were
from 11 of the 20 studies analyzing rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1997 (18 years ago) and that is
expected to have a historically low established price and
consequently a lower ICER value.

We also carefully scrutinized the potential bias
related to industry-funded studies. Two industrysponsored studies compared bortezomib with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone or with dexamethasone
alone.17,18 The 2 analyses used data from the same multiinstitutional studies. The first, sponsored by Johnson &
Johnson (the bortezomib drug company), concluded that
bortezomib provided a good treatment value in comparison with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (although not
in comparison with dexamethasone alone, the actual
standard of care). In contrast, using the same clinical data,
the second analysis, sponsored by Celgene (the lenalidomide drug company), reached the conclusion that lenalidomide/dexamethasone provided a good treatment value
in comparison with bortezomib. On the basis of the provided data, we could not calculate the ICER for lenalidomide versus dexamethasone. This highlights the fact that
industry-funded studies may have a significant bias related
to the choice of the study design, selection of comparators,
methodology, and clinical assumptions.42
In their analysis,7 Saret et al. combined the results of
29 studies and presented a median ICER. Their simplified
approach ignored the heterogeneity in underlying disease
progression, patient characteristics, modeling assumptions, and so forth. For example, operator-dependent
assumptions such as health-related quality-of-life of the
model states (eg, 0.6 vs 0.8) can influence QALYs and
ICERs drastically. Similarly, the choice of comparators in
the cost-effectiveness analysis is an important factor (eg,
comparing tyrosine kinase inhibitors with hydroxyurea or
interferon or comparing dasatinib with imatinib at 400 or
800 mg daily). In contrast to meta-analyses of clinical trials and observational studies, no standards exist for combining cost-effectiveness results in a systematic way.
Therefore, a conclusion based on a median ICER of stud3376

ies that does not account for heterogeneous factors could
be misleading. The median ICER value could be perceived to be lower if the analysis included many studies of
a lower priced drug (rituximab in this case: 11 of the 20
evaluable studies). If newer therapies are considered (eg,
tyrosine kinase inhibitors for CML, lenalidomide/bortezomib for myeloma, B-cell receptors inhibitors for CLL,
and checkpoint inhibitors), then all the individual ICER
values but one far exceed the accepted $50,000/QALY
(Table 1). Several recently published studies of newer
treatments for hematologic cancers reflect the high prices
of such novel treatments.43-46

DISCUSSION
Saret et al7 concluded that “innovative treatments for hematologic malignancies may provide reasonable value for
money.” The authors cautioned that their analysis
included a limited number of studies, some older drugs,
and a mixture of industry-funded and non–industryfunded studies. In further discussions, they clarified that
the cost-effectiveness ratios may have changed over time
because of the increase in drug prices. Despite these caveats, the study was interpreted in several medical news
outlets to support the notion that high drug prices for hematologic malignancies are justified because they offer
high treatment value.47,48 Because the analysis used the
older drug prices in the particular year and geographic
area of each study, the conclusions may not justify the
high current cancer drug prices in the United States
today.
Our analysis accounted for these issues and reached
different conclusions: the current prices of the majority of
the drugs used to treat hematologic malignancies are not
justified. The estimated ICERs (dollars per QALY) of
most studies published until 2012 far exceeded a good
treatment value. Our conclusions are different because we
used the current drug prices and accounted for the price
differences between the United States and elsewhere.
With today’s costs, the drug prices far exceed their treatment values and should, therefore, be scrutinized.
We agree that the debates in health care costs should
consider the value of breakthrough drugs, not just the
costs. With the metric commonly used in health economics, the high drug prices are not justified. It is worth noting that the studies on which the analysis of Saret et al7
and our re-analysis were based did not include any new
drugs or studies after 2012. Our search identified several
recent studies in which the ICERs of drugs far exceeded
the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of
Cancer

High Drug Prices for Hematologic Malignancies/Chhatwal et al

$50,000/QALY,43-46 and this is in line with our
conclusions.
The reasons behind the significant rise in cancer
drug prices may be traced to the Medicare Reform Act of
2003, in which legislation was inserted that prevented
Medicare from negotiating drug prices, and to the added
legislation of Medicare Part D, which requires Medicare
to pay for all such oral drugs.49 This left drug companies
as the sole decision makers on how high to price a novel
treatment or how much to increase the annual price of
older therapies. This situation translated into significant
increases in drug company revenues since 2006 when the
legislature was implemented.50 A study by Howard et al51
showed that cancer drug prices have increased by an average of $8500 per year over the past 15 years, and the initial
drug price in the United States serves as the starting bargaining point for insurance companies in the United
States and for health care entities outside the United
States. The same study reported that the cost of drugs for
each additional year lived, after adjustments for inflation,
increased from $54,000 in 1995 to $207,000 in 2013.
Therefore, regulations on the cost of new treatments, as
commonly performed in almost all other developed countries, will make health care more affordable for patients
and providers in the United States.
High drug costs also have direct implications for
patients. Studies have shown that 10% to 20% of
patients cannot afford the treatments and decide either
not to take them or to compromise them.52,53 Patients
are faced with the hard choice of using their financial
resources to prolong their lives or foregoing the treatment to save money for other family necessities (food,
education, and housing). With the ever rising cost of
cancer treatment, we could soon reach a point at which
our health care system can no longer timely treat all
patients with cancer, as is currently the case with hepatitis C drugs.54
In our analysis, which disregarded drugs of little or
no use today (interferon-a and alemtuzumab), the drugs
offering good treatment value were rituximab and bendamustine. Rituximab was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1997 (18 years ago) and is expected to
be even less expensive today. Still, its ICER ranged from
$37,000 to $69,000/QALY (with 1 high exception of
$406,000/QALY). Bendamustine, an alkylating agent
available in East Germany since the 1950s and revitalized
for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, showed a reasonable treatment value. This left in the analysis only the
tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CML and
the 2 myeloma drugs lenalidomide and bortezomib, all of

with the older standard of care. A recent wave of new and
promising drugs for hematologic malignancies is of concern because of their high prices, which were not considered in the current analysis. These include the new
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (bosutinib and ponatinib) and
omacetaxine for CML, the new B cell receptor inhibitors
for CLL and lymphoma (ibrutinib and idelalisib), the
new monoclonal antibodies for lymphoid malignancies
(ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, and blinatumomab), the
new-generation immunomodulatory inhibitory derivatives and proteasome inhibitors for myeloma, and the new
checkpoint inhibitors.
An issue with economic analyses (unrelated to this
study) is the operative-dependent assumptions, which can
be subjective and depend on the particular investigators’
interests. Modeling and data assumptions can vary significantly. These include the value assigned to quality of life
in a particular year of life, the price and duration of an
intervention, the price of complications of an intervention
(eg, related to hospitalization), the price and need of additional interventions caused by these complications, and
other factors. For example, the morbidity factor for a year
lived can be valued as 0.6 or 0.8 according to subjective
assumptions, and this would make a drastic difference in
the calculated ICER value. This highlights the issue of
whether these measures could be standardized more
objectively.
Borrowing from the experience in human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, we realize that such patients can now live a
normal life span but require daily therapy with drugs
that cost $10,000 to 18,000 per year. In essence, patients
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome pay less than
$20,000 per year lived. Many new therapies for cancer
are following the trend of daily oral therapies for a lifetime.55 However, in cancer, therapies have staggering
costs of more than $120,000 per year lived; this is an expensive endeavor not affordable by many patients with
cancer, including the well-insured. Efforts should continue to develop cancer policies that make cancer therapies available and affordable to all. Cancer drugs with
lower prices will have significantly better and stable market penetration, and this will allow many more patients
to live longer on therapies and thus increase longer term
drug company profits.56 In essence, drug companies will
do good and do well.
