Abstract

Author Manuscript

Alkyltransferase-like proteins (ATLs) share functional motifs with the cancer chemotherapy target
O6-alkylguanine DNA-alkyltransferase (AGT) and paradoxically protect cells from the biological
effects of DNA alkylation damage, despite lacking the AGT reactive cysteine and alkyltransferase
activity. Here we determine S. pombe ATL structures without and with damaged DNA containing
endogenous lesion O6-methylguanine or cigarette smoke-derived O6-4-(3-pyridyl)-4oxobutylguanine. These results reveal non-enzymatic DNA nucleotide flipping plus increased
DNA distortion and binding pocket size compared to AGT. Our analysis of lesion-binding site
conservation identifies new ATLs in sea anemone and ancestral archaea, indicating ATL
interactions are ancestral to present-day repair pathways in all domains of life. Genetic
connections to XPG and ERCC1 in S. pombe homologs Rad13 and Swi10 and biochemical
interactions with UvrA and UvrC combined with structural results reveal that ATLs sculpt
alkylated DNA to create a genetic and structural intersection of base damage processing with
nucleotide excision repair.

Author Manuscript

DNA O6-alkylguanine lesions are mutagenic and cytotoxic: they mis-pair during replication
with thymine, resulting in G:C to A:T transition mutations1–4. Human O6-alkylguanine
DNA lesions are repaired by O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), also known as
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which transfers guanine O6-alkyl
adducts to its reactive cysteine reversing damage1. This prevents mutations but resists
alkylating chemotherapies2,5. Active site -PCHRV- motif Cys1456,7 plus Arg128 and
Tyr114 nucleotide rotating residues are conserved from bacterial to human AGTs1,2,8.
Human AGT (hAGT) structures alone9,10 and with small molecule9 or DNA11,12
substrates showed how AGT promotes resistance to anticancer therapies by directly
reversing DNA guanine alkylation damage.2

Author Manuscript

Recently bacterial and yeast proteins with sequence similarity to the AGT DNA-binding
domain were identified with the Cys alkyl acceptor replaced by tryptophan, alanine, or
another residue,13 and hence named alkyltransferase-like proteins (ATLs). ATLs from S.
pombe (Atl1) and E. coli (eAtl) inhibit O6-methylguanine (O6-mG) repair by hAGT14,15.
eAtl also binds abasic site-containing dsDNA,16 and Atl1 binds ssDNA containing O6methyl-, O6-benzyl-, O6-(4-bromothenyl)- or O6-hydroxyethyl-guanine. Yet, ATLs do not
cleave the alkyl group, base, or oligonucleotide near the lesion14,15, and eAtl Trp to Cys
mutation does not restore alkyltransferase activity14. As S. pombe and T. thermophilus lack
AGT, and inactivation of their ATL genes, atl1 and TTHA1564, respectively15,17, reduces
their alkylation damage resistance, ATLs protect against biological effects of DNA
alkylation damage by an undefined mechanism.
Tight binding affinities16,17 for and inability to repair14,15 O6-alkyl lesions implied ATLs
are damage sensors or act in nucleotide excision repair (NER)13,15, which excises bulky,
DNA-distorting lesions. However, lack of structures, persuasive evidence, or specific
mechanism has obscured how ATL ameliorates DNA damage effects. To clarify this

protection, we combined structural, biochemical, and genetic experiments on Atl1 from the
fission yeast S. pombe. Our results reveal ATL binding generates a stable complex that
sculpts alkylated DNA base damage for NER pathway entry.

Atl1 structure and lesion binding

Author Manuscript

To characterize Atl1-DNA damage interactions, we crystallized and solved structures to 2.0,
2.7, and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively, for Atl1 alone (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1)
and in complex with oligonucleotides containing either O6-mG (Fig. 1b, d and
Supplementary Table 1) or O6-4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylguanine (O6-pobG) (Fig. 1c and
Supplementary Table 1), a bulky and toxicologically-relevant adduct18. Atl1 shares the
hAGT catalytic domain fold (superposition root mean square difference = 1.6 Å) (Fig. 1a),
including residues required for AGT activity, DNA-binding, and nucleotide flipping. Yet,
Atl1 specifically lacks AGT’s active site Cys and Asn hinge that couples helix-turn-helix
(HTH) DNA binding and active site motifs (Fig. 1a).

Author Manuscript

Atl1 flips both O6-mG (Fig. 1b, d) and O6-pobG (Fig. 1c) into a pocket containing PWHRV- motif Trp56, consistent with fluorescence measured flipping for a base opposite
an AP site in eAtl16 and for O6-mG in TTHA156417. Atl1 displays no AGT activity,15
suggesting nucleotide flipping is a switch for pathway activation, not catalysis. To our
knowledge, Atl1 (Fig. 1b–d), eAtl16, and TTHA156417 are among the first reported nonenzymatic DNA-binding proteins that flip nucleotides. Our Atl1 structures show ATL
rotates nucleotides into a specificity pocket. Arg39 intercalates the DNA base stack (Fig. 1d)
and hydrogen bonds the orphaned cytosine, thereby stabilizing the extra-helical
alkylguanine. Trp56, rather than AGT Cys, is evident in electron density omit maps (Fig.
1a), acting in hydrophobic packing with the alkyl group (Fig. 1c, d). Arg69 guanidinium
stacks against the alkylguanine base in a cation-π interaction (Fig. 1d).
Alkylguanine base side and main chain hydrogen bonds are conserved from Atl1 to AGT,
but the Atl1 lesion-binding pocket is ~three times larger (Supplementary Table 2). Loop
residues 65–73 define one wall of the alkyl-binding pocket, adopting a conformation further
from the protein core than in AGT, thereby enlarging the pocket (Fig. 1a and Fig. 2a). Also,
lesion-binding pocket Lys45-Pro55 cap is ~5.3 Å further out than the comparable AGT
Pro140 (Cα to Cα distance) that interacts with larger alkyl groups9,11,12. Moreover, ATL
Ile71 replaces AGT Tyr158, which would clash with the Atl1 Trp56 side chain in its DNAbound, closed position.

Author Manuscript

Atl1’s larger cavity explains its broad lesion range that includes O6-benzyl-, O6-(4bromothenyl)- or O6-hydroxyethyl-guanine. In the O6-pobG-DNA complex structure, the
pob group is wedged between Pro50 and Trp56, making only these hydrophobic protein
interactions (Fig. 1c). No major changes in lesion-binding site, or DNA conformation occur
between O6-mG- and O6-pobG-bound Atl1. Pob would push against the active (or binding)
site loop in the smaller AGT active site, explaining why AGT repairs pob lesions at a
decreased rate compared to O6-mG19. Pob adopts a conformation incompatible with smaller
E. coli AGT (Ada-C and Ogt) active site pockets, consistent with its poor repair by Ada-C
and Ogt20 and need for ATLs for bulky adducts in organisms like E. coli.

Atl1 DNA-binding
Like AGT, Atl1 uses an HTH motif to bind the DNA minor groove (Fig. 1b and Fig. 2a). All
damaged-strand contacts are to alkylguanine and two 3’-adjacent nucleotide phosphate
groups (Fig. 2d). DNA binding site loop (Ser67 and Lys70) and loop (Thr92 and Ser93)
residues form DNA contacts not found in AGT. Atl1 DNA-binding buries ~1050 Å2 versus
788 Å2 of AGT buried surface area, consistent with tighter DNA binding16,17.

Author Manuscript

Atl1 bends DNA by ~45° (Fig. 2a), whereas AGT only bends DNA ~30°11. Atl1 achieves
greater DNA bending through synergistic N-terminus and binding site loop actions. The
Atl1 N-terminal helix extends outward more than the corresponding AGT helix, which
follows a loop leading toward the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1a and Fig. 2a). This N-terminal
extension pushes against the phosphate backbone of the complementary strand opposite the
flipped nucleotide. Moreover, the binding site loop acts as a gate that switches between
“open” (Fig. 2b) and “closed” (Fig. 2c) conformations of free and DNA-bound Atl1,
respectively, with flanking glycines suggesting flexibility. This “gating” action was
proposed in AGT computational simulations21, but not seen in crystal structures11,12. The
Atl1 binding site loop open-to-closed conformational switch appears suitable to play an
active role in signalling by shifting covering Arg and Ile side chains to expose the Cterminal loop for possible intermolecular interactions.

Author Manuscript

If the closed, bent ATL-DNA complex is a platform for repair protein recognition, then we
expect the complex to be stable; yet, KD was estimated by gel-shift as only 0.41 µM for
TTHA1564 with O6-mG17. To test binding affinity, we measured Atl1 binding and
dissociation to and from oligonucleotides containing O6-mG, O6-pobG, or abasic site by
surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 3a). Atl1 binding to oligonucleotides containing alkylG was
0.02–0.3 nM, but binding to abasic site dsDNA was low and/or transient (Fig. 3a). Langmuir
fit with mass transfer limitation indicates kass = 1.21×10−7±0.20×10−7 M−1s−1; kdiss = 0.004
± 0.0006 s−1 and KD = 0.35 ± 0.04 nM for O6-mG and kass = 2.20×10−7± 0.56×10−7
M−1s−1; kdiss = 0.0003 ± 0.00002 s−1 and KD = 0.016 ± 0.004 nM for O6-pobG. Thus, while
“on” rates were similar for both lesions, the “off” rate for pob oligonucleotide was slower:
higher affinity (KD) for the pob oligonucleotide shows larger O6-alkyl groups are
accommodated stably.

Author Manuscript

We also measured Atl1 binding to methylated double-strand oligonucleotides by gel-shift
(Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3) and verified saturated
complex stoichiometries by sedimentation equilibrium analysis (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Table 3). Dominant complexes for 13-mer oligonucleotides in solution have 1:1
stoichiometry (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Table 3), consistent with our crystal structures,
whereas 16-mers form 2:1 limiting complexes (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary
Table 3) and 26-mers form 3:1 limiting complexes (Supplementary Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Table 3). Saturated Atl1-nonmethylated DNA complex is formed without
intermediate accumulation, suggesting cooperative binding to nonmethylated DNA. DNAs
containing O6-mG form 1:1 complexes before proceeding to saturation in an additional
concerted step, suggesting specific binding to O6-mG sites precedes build-up of cooperative
assembly, consistent with the open-to-closed switch and a binding site size of ~8 bp. This

differs from AGT’s binding site size of 4 bp/protein22, possibly due to AGT's added Nterminal domain and the open-to-closed switch (not seen in AGT) that exposes the Cterminal loop.

Atl1 connections to NER
ATLs tightly bind oligonucleotides containing O6-alkylguanine and switch conformation to
expose the C-terminal loop, suggesting ATL-DNA complex binding partners are possible, in
vivo. In fact, NER protein UvrA interacts with TTHA156417. Similarly, far-western analysis
reveals eAtl interacts with E. coli NER proteins UvrA and UvrC in vitro (Fig. 4a). E. coli
DNA repair helicase IV (HelD) is also a potential eAtl binding partner16. Interestingly, S.
pombe Atl1 interacts with E. coli UvrA in vitro (Fig. 4b), suggesting ATLs conserve
features across species for NER recognition.

Author Manuscript

Strikingly, increased spontaneous mutation rate of Δrad13 cells is suppressed to wild-type
levels by additional Atl1 inactivation (Fig. 4c bottom). This effect is not due to decreased
cell survival, as all mutants tested here are viable (Supplementary Fig. 3). Clonogenic assays
also revealed Atl1 is epistatic with S. pombe Swi10 (Fig. 4f), but not Rhp14 (Fig. 4g) or
Rad2 (Fig. 4h) (homologs of human ERCC1, XPA and Fen-1, respectively), for MNNG
toxicity. The non-epistatic relationship between Atl1 and Rhp14 suggests Rhp14 has an
NER-independent function in response to MNNG, consistent with Rhp14 responses to other
DNA damaging agents (R.K. and O.F., unpublished data). As Rad2 plays a role in longpatch base excision repair (BER)24 and the alternative UV excision repair25, lack of
epistasis between atl1 and rad2 implies the two proteins work in different pathways. Rad13
and swi10 mutant phenotypes may reflect build-up of stable hard-to-repair ATL-complex
intermediates in the absence of these NER proteins, suggesting ATL-DNA complexes may
block alternative repair. Similarly, Atl1 protects E. coli cells against MNNG-induced
alkylation damage (Supplementary Table 4). Thus, both microbial and eukaryotic genetic
evidence suggests ATL bridges DNA-alkylation base damage responses to NER.

Author Manuscript

Author Manuscript

To test for Atl1 functional genetic interactions with the NER pathway in fission yeast, we
analyzed S. pombe atl1 and rad13 (NER pathway XPG endonuclease human homolog which
cuts 3' of DNA lesions23) single and double deletants. We measured Atl1’s ability to protect
cells from MNNG-induced and spontaneous mutations (Fig. 4c–e). MNNG sensitivity of
Δatl1 cells was complemented by a plasmid harbouring atl1 (Supplementary Fig. 2),
indicating observed cellular phenotypes are due to atl1 deletion. Atl1 inactivation causes ~9fold increased reversion rate of the ade6-485 mutation, similar to the Δrad13 mutant (Fig. 4c
top). The MNNG-induced mutation rate is not further increased in the Δatl1 Δrad13 double
mutant, revealing an epistatic relationship between Atl1 and Rad13 (Fig. 4c top). These
results are supported by spot tests (Fig. 4d) and clonogenic assays (Fig. 4e) indicating Atl1
and Rad13 are also epistatic for MNNG toxicity.

Identification of novel ATLs
To see if our structures may characterize other ATLs, we mapped sequence conservation of
197 ATL sequences based upon the Atl1 structure (Supplementary Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Fig. 5). For all ATLs, the most conserved residues line the lesion-binding

pocket or act in DNA binding in our structures, suggesting our Atl1 structures are
paradigmatic for ATLs.

Author Manuscript

Significantly, our structure-based sequence analyses helped us identify here the first ATL
from any multicellular organism, the recently sequenced starlet sea anemone Nematostella
vectensis26 plus two archaeal ATLs from Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum27 and
Nanoarchaeum equitans28, ancestral to the two established phyla of archaea (Genbank
accession numbers XM_001618690, YP_001736655, and NP_963633, respectively;
Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 6). We verified N. vectensis ATL blocks
alkyltransferase activity of hAGT (Supplementary Fig. 7), confirming it is an ATL. The N.
vectensis genome, which aided in genome characterization of the long-extinct last common
ancestor of all eumetazoans, is surprisingly more similar to vertebrates than fruit flies or
nematodes26. Therefore, existence of ATL in this multi-cellular eukaryote, plus yeast,
bacteria, and ancestral archaea shows ATL is present in all three domains of life and argues
ATL was common to evolutionary branches before complex eukaryotes. This discovery
suggests higher eukaryotes and mammals will either have an ATL or have lost or replaced it
with an analogous protein.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Alkylated DNA base damage is classically repaired by direct damage reversal proteins or by
lesion-specific DNA glycosylases, which excise modified bases to create abasic sites and
initiate the BER pathway29. These base repair processes differ from the versatile NER
removal of bulky, unrelated, helix distorting lesions by excising a lesion-containing DNA
patch30. Our combined results reveal a general mechanism for ATL to bind weakly
distorting O6-alkylguanine lesions and recruit NER proteins (Fig. 5). We propose ATL
binding sculpts alkylguanine into a bulky lesion that is channeled into the NER pathway,
explaining NER-mediated repair of O6-alkylguanine lesions31–33.

Author Manuscript

ATL may be an unrecognized NER element, with analogues in many organisms, that targets
endogenous alkylation damage to NER nucleases. In higher eukaryotes, the NER
transcription-coupled repair (TCR) sub-pathway engages downstream damage recognition
components of global genome repair (GGR), to effect lesion removal from the transcribed
strand34. The NER GGR sub-pathway is initiated by XPC recognition of bulky lesions and,
like TCR, results in damage removal by incision on either side of the lesion35. As the O6mG lesion is insufficient to block transcription36, ATL binding may stall RNA polymerase
to initiate TCR and/or promote lesion processing analogously to DDB2 of mammalian GGR.
Atl1-DNA contacts are with the damaged strand, similar to DDB237, consistent with
possible undamaged strand binding by fission yeast XPC homologues Rhp41 or Rhp42, as
shown for S. cerevisiae XPC orthologue, Rad438.
ATLs are not alkyltransferases14,15,17 or glycosylases14,15, but inhibit AGT14,15
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Lack of epistasis for MNNG-induced cell killing between atl1 and
rad2 shows ATL is not a long-patch BER or alternative UV excision repair protein. Yet,
ATL damage recognition resembles AGT and BER glycosylases rather than NER proteins:
positive channel for lesion-binding and 180° nucleotide flipping, which allow protein

handoffs without release of toxic and mutagenic DNA intermediates, a hallmark of BER and
recombination repair pathways39–43.

Author Manuscript

ATL binding targets base damage to NER, showing how proteins that bind damage, but do
not repair it, may redirect lesion processing.44 First, ATL binds base damage analogously to
AGT and BER glycosylases2,45, but presents damage to NER similarly to DDB2. Second,
in some organisms ATL can block AGT O6-alkylguanine damage recognition and redirect
base repair to NER, constituting a crosstalk pathway connection,44 as proposed for
AGT33,46, and recently for eATL20. Third, ATL redirects endogenous damage from other
repair pathways to NER, as Δrad13 mutator is rescued in Δatl1 Δrad13. Fourth, ancestral
archaeal ATL’s are ATL-Endo V fusions, suggesting ATL and Endo V act together in a
coordinated pathway47 with BER nuclease Endo V serving a possible XPG-like function in
these organisms, as AGT-Endo V fusion proteins retain both activities48. By the Rosetta
Stone evolution hypothesis for protein interactions47, ATL-Endo V fusions imply ATL
provides a primordial connection joining BER and NER. Indeed, recent structures of
EndoV49 and NER complex DDB1-DDB237 support such an ancient BER-NER connection
by revealing a mutual, wedge-based binding mechanism50. Thus, non-enzymatic nucleotide
flipping emerges as a surprisingly general mechanism to channel specific base damage into
the general damage NER pathway by handoff from a non-enzymatic complex.

Methods Summary
Atl1 purification, crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection, and structural refinement

Author Manuscript

C-terminally 6x-His tagged Atl1 was expressed in JM109 cells and purified over Ni-NTA
agarose and Superdex 75 columns. Atl1:O6-mG- and Atl1:O6-pobG-DNA complexes were
prepared at a 1.5:1 DNA:protein molar ratio. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor
diffusion. Diffraction data were collected at ALS beamline 12.3.1 for Atl1 and at SSRL
beamline 11-1 for Atl1:O6-mG and Atl1:O6-pobG DNA complexes, and were processed
with HKL2000. Structures were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser, using a
modified wild-type Ada-C (PDB code 1SFE) as a search model for Atl1, and the refined
Atl1 structure as a search model for Atl1:DNA complexes. Crystallographic refinement was
done with Crystallography & NMR System (CNS), and Xfit was used for manual model
building.
DNA binding by Atl

Author Manuscript

Oligonucleotide-Atl1 interactions were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay
using standard methods and by surface plasmon resonance with biotinylated O6-mG-, O6pobG-, or AP-site-containing or control oligonucleotides immobilized on a streptavidincoated surface of a Biacore SA chip and serial dilutions of Atl1 applied to the cell. DNA
complex stoichiometries formed under protein saturation conditions were established by
sedimentation equilibrium analysis.
Other biochemical assays
AGT inhibition assays performed as described previously. Far western analyses performed
