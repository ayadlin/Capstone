Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The discovery of millions of PIWI–interacting RNAs revealed a fascinating and unanticipated
dimension of biology. The PIWI–piRNA pathway has been commonly perceived as germline–
specific, even though the somatic function of PIWI proteins was documented when they were first
discovered. Recent studies have begun to re–explore this pathway in somatic cells in diverse
organisms, particularly lower eukaryotes. These studies have illustrated the multifaceted somatic
functions of the pathway not only in transposon silencing but also in genome rearrangement and
epigenetic programming, with biological roles in stem–cell function, whole–body regeneration,
memory and possibly cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The discoveries of small non-coding RNAs, including PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs),
have significantly expanded the RNA world. piRNAs are generally 24–32 nucleotides in
length and bind specifically to the PIWI subfamily of Argonaute proteins. Piwi was
originally discovered in Drosophila1, in which it functions in germline stem-cell
maintenance and self-renewal2. For clarity, we use PIWIs to refer collectively to PIWI
proteins, whereas Piwi refers to the individual protein. Although piRNAs were discovered
and formally defined in mammalian systems in 2006 as small non-coding RNAs that
specifically interact with PIWIs3-6, cloning of piRNAs in Drosophila7-9 revealed that they
include a previously discovered class of small non-coding RNAs called repeat-associated
RNAs (rasiRNAs)10,11. Since 2006, the PIWI–piRNA field has rapidly advanced, with a
focus on the germ line, in which PIWIs and piRNAs are enriched and PIWI mutations lead
to a profound infertility phenotype12-14. Indeed, the name PIWI comes from the original
mutant phenotype P-element-induced wimpy testis1. The best-known role of the PIWI–
piRNA pathway in the germ line is in transposon silencing, because piRNAs map largely to
transposable elements9, with PIWI depletion leading to a drastic increase in transposon
messenger RNA expression15.
Despite the germline focus, since their discovery, PIWIs’ somatic function has long been
documented. Initial work on the Drosophila gene piwi, the first identified member that

defines the Argonaute gene family, determined that its germline function depends on the
somatic cells of the gonad2. Recently, significant insight into the somatic function of the
PIWI–piRNA pathway has come from the ovarian somatic cells of Drosophila. In addition,
groundbreaking work in lower eukaryotes has demonstrated a conserved function for PIWIs
and their associated piRNAs in somatic tissues — particularly in stem cells. In this Review,
we focus on the role of the PIWI–piRNA pathway in the soma of diverse organisms, from
basal eukaryotes to humans. We begin by looking at PIWI expression and piRNA biogenesis
in somatic tissues, and then illustrate how the PIWI–piRNA pathway exerts diverse
functions, including epigenetic regulation, transposon silencing, genome rearrangement and
developmental regulation. Through this Review we hope to illustrate a broader role for the
PIWI–piRNA pathway in the soma.

Expression of PIWIs and piRNAs in somatic tissues

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PIWIs are expressed in organisms from sponges to humans. This expression occurs in
remarkably diverse cell types, ranging from naive pluripotent stem cells to differentiated
somatic cells, with most somatic expression related to various totipotent and pluripotent
stem cells16-24 (Table 1). Several studies have demonstrated an essential stem-cell function
for PIWIs. One interesting example comes from planarian stem cells. piwi genes are
expressed in planarian totipotent stem cells, called neoblasts, that can repopulate all somatic
and germline lineages. Planarians have an unusual regenerative capability, in which
neoblasts are responsible for maintaining and regenerating all tissues. PIWIs play a crucial
part in the neoblast lineage, as illustrated by the two phenotypic consequences of
knockdown of mRNAs encoding PIWIs: first, animals are incapable of body-part
regeneration; and second, failure of tissue maintenance ultimately results in death21.
Furthermore, piRNA-like small RNAs, which depend on PIWIs for their biogenesis, have
been identified in planaria. These RNAs are not germline-restricted, because ablation of the
germ line by nanos mRNA knockdown does not affect piRNA-like RNA production21,22. In
addition, RNA interference (RNAi) experiments in ascidians have demonstrated the
requirement for PIWIs in whole-body regeneration (discussed later)23,24.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although substantial work has described PIWI expression beyond the germ line of lower
eukaryotes, the somatic function of PIWIs was first characterized in somatic cells of the
Drosophila ovary. The Drosophila Piwi protein is expressed in all somatic cells within the
ovary and in early somatic cells of the testis2,25. Outside the gonad, Piwi binds to polytene
chromosomes of the salivary gland26. Emerging and unexpected evidence shows that PIWIs
function outside the gonad, particularly in the Drosophila head. The first genetic evidence
showed that piwi mutation leads to position effect variegation in the expression of the eye
colour gene white in a clonal fashion8,26. This suggests the possibility of cell-autonomous
Piwi function in the eye. Direct molecular evidence came from a more recent study in which
two Drosophila PIWIs, Argonaute-3 and Aubergine, which were once thought to be
germline-specific, showed region-specific expression in the brain, with their mutation
leading to transposon upregulation in fly heads27. Interestingly, piRNA-like small RNAs
mapping to transposons and heterochromatin are detectable in the Drosophila head on
depletion of the RNAi effector Argonaute-2 (ref. 28). A recent publication has shown that
all Drosophila PIWIs are expressed during early embryogenesis and that depletion of

maternal Drosophila PIWIs results in profound chromosomal and mitotic defects, thus
establishing a crucial function for PIWIs in the earliest stage of somatic development29.
Together with the work on basal eukaryotes, studies in Drosophila highlight the existence
and function of PIWIs in somatic tissues. Although somatic PIWIs clearly function in
Drosophila, it remains a mystery whether piRNAs are generated outside the gonad, because
some of the most studied piRNA biogenesis factors are not robustly expressed in nongonadal somatic tissue (discussed later).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In light of the above findings, an important question remains: are PIWIs present in
mammalian somatic tissues? There are four human PIWIs: HIWI (also known as PIWIL1),
HILI (also known as PIWIL2), HIWI2 (also known as PIWIL4) and HIWI3 (also known as
PIWIL3). HIWI is expressed in haematopoietic stem cells but not in their differentiated
progeny. Although this once led to the suggestion that HIWI might be involved in the
stemness of these stem cells30, a powerful genetic experiment in which all three mouse Piwi
genes were knocked out showed no detectable effect on haematopoiesis. Thus, PIWI
expression in haematopoietic stem cells may not have any functional implication or PIWI
function is redundant with other proteins, possibly Argonaute subfamily proteins31. With
regards to human health, many studies demonstrate PIWI expression in a wide variety of
human cancers; however, these data are at best correlative and it is too early to tell whether
PIWIs have any role in cancer (discussed later)32-36.
The expression of PIWIs in mammalian somatic tissues implies the potential existence of
somatic piRNAs. One study provided evidence of piRNA expression in diverse somatic
tissues of both the mouse and macaque37. However, the lack of appropriate negative
controls combined with a small library size make it difficult to differentiate between true
piRNA expression and contamination during library preparation. Indeed, this study might be
a cautionary tale describing the challenges in the search for mammalian somatic piRNAs.
Further work will help to determine whether piRNAs are expressed outside the germ line in
mammals. Perhaps malignant tissues are good sites to begin the search given the expression
of PIWIs in cancer.

piRNA biogenesis in the Drosophila ovarian soma
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our mechanistic understanding of somatic piRNA biogenesis comes from recent work in the
somatic follicle cells of the Drosophila ovary. piRNAs in the ovarian soma are generated by
a Piwi-dependent mechanism through the primary piRNA biogenesis pathway38,39. This
process is independent of the other two Drosophila PIWIs, Aubergine and Argonaute-3,
which function as a piRNA amplification loop in the germline cells (known as secondary
piRNA biogenesis). In the primary piRNA biogenesis pathway, long piRNA precursors are
transcribed from specific genomic loci known as piRNA clusters, cleaved and modified in
the cytoplasm, and then transported into the nucleus in complex with Piwi (Fig. 1). Ovarian
soma-specific piRNAs are transcribed from two main loci. The flamenco locus contains
transposon remnants and encodes a long single-stranded piRNA precursor that is antisense
to flamenco’s component transposons. Precursors generated from the flamenco locus target
transposons of the gypsy family of long terminal repeat (LTR) transposons, including gypsy,
ZAM and idefix38. Another ovarian soma-specific locus, traffic jam, has two functions: the 3′

UTR of its transcript is a substrate for somatic piRNA production, whereas its protein
product drives Piwi expression in ovarian somatic cells39.

It is unclear how long single-stranded piRNA precursors are exported from the nucleus and
how these precursors are initially processed into smaller fragments in the cytoplasm. One
proposed, but unproven, candidate for piRNA 5′ end determination is Zucchini, an outer
mitochondrial membrane protein with single-strand-specific endonuclease activity in vitro40.
In Drosophila, the maturing precursor then enters the perinuclear Yb body41-43, an ovarian
soma-specific cytoplasmic structure named after the Yb protein44. Although it is not yet
clear what occurs in the Yb body, several of its components are crucial for the processing of
piRNA precursors into mature piRNAs, and for subsequent Piwi nuclear localization. These
components include the helicase Armitage41-43 and the TUDOR-domain-containing protein
Vreteno44. Both Vreteno45 and Yb41,43 are needed for Piwi expression and/or stability.
Zucchini also functions in piRNA maturation. Knockdown of the mRNA encoding Zucchini
in a Drosophila ovarian somatic cell line leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of piRNAintermediate-like molecules46 and accumulation of Piwi in the Yb body; correspondingly,
nuclear Piwi is absent42. The mouse homologues of the above piRNA biogenesis factors,
including Zucchini47, Armitage48,49, Shutdown50,51 and Vreteno52 are crucial for piRNA
biogenesis in the testes, and male mutants are infertile, thus implying conservation of these
factors in piRNA biogenesis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, piRNAs are loaded onto Piwi in the cytoplasm through an uncharacterized step that is
independent of Piwi slicer activity and nuclear localization signal39,53. The co-chaperone
Shutdown, which is essential to piRNA biogenesis in both the ovarian soma and germ line,
may function in piRNA loading54. Ovarian somatic piRNAs contain a characteristic 5′ U,
but the mechanism generating this 5′ U bias is unknown. It is possible that Piwi itself
preferentially binds RNAs with 5′ U, as is the case for silkworm Piwi in vitro55. This might
authenticate and stabilize piRNA intermediates with 5′ U for further processing. An
unknown protein then trims the 3′ ends of the maturing piRNAs. The shared structure of
Argonaute family proteins suggests the possibility that piRNA length may be determined by
the number of bases protected within Piwi56-58. This also explains the characteristic size
profile of piRNAs bound by each of the three Drosophila PIWIs9. Mature piRNAs are then
2′-O-methylated by a conserved methyltransferase, Pimet59, perhaps to ensure their stability.
Finally, in an uncharacterized step, the Piwi–piRNA complex is imported into the nucleus to
exert its regulatory function.

Epigenetic regulation by the PIWI–piRNA pathway
Strong evidence indicates that Piwi and piRNAs play a crucial part in epigenetic regulation.
Pioneering work has shown that Piwi functions in the transcriptional silencing of Adh
transgene arrays, and small RNAs have been proposed to have a role in Piwi-mediated
silencing60. Piwi is a predominantly nuclear protein25 that localizes to salivary gland
polytene chromosomes in an RNA-dependent manner26, and co-localizes with known
epigenetic modifiers such as the Polycomb group proteins61. There is general agreement that
Piwi is required for appropriate histone methylation and transcriptional gene silencing, as
loss of Piwi in both germ line and soma leads to a decrease in the repressive methylation

mark on histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9)62-66, an increase in RNA Pol II occupancy63-65 and an
increase in nascent transcript60,63,66. Indeed, tissue-specific knockdown of Piwi in somatic
ovarian follicle cells implicates transcriptional repression as the dominant mode of
transposable element control in the soma66.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

What is the mechanism by which Piwi directs epigenetic modification? The answer to this
lies in piRNA, which probably guides Piwi to specific target sequences in the genome by
sequence complementarity63-66. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data from our
laboratory suggest that the Piwi–piRNA complex binds its genomic target in euchromatin
through a nascent transcript (often a long non-coding RNA), and in heterochromatin
predominantly through a direct piRNA-DNA interaction26,64. According to these results,
which await reproduction by other labs, the Piwi–piRNA complex then recruits epigenetic
factors such as HP1a and the histone methyltransferase Su(var)3-9 to exert their function
(Fig. 2). HP1a is a highly conserved chromatin factor whose N-terminal chromodomain
binds trimethylated H3K9 whereas the C-terminal chromoshadow domain dimerizes with
the same domain in another HP1a molecule and interacts with other proteins64. Piwi may
directly recruit HP1a26. HP1a may then recruit one of its well-characterized interactors,
Su(var)3-9, which is responsible for most H3K9 methylation in Drosophila64. Alternatively,
others have proposed that Piwi may first recruit a histone methyltransferase such as
Su(var)3-9 or Setdb1. The methyltransferase could establish H3K9 methylation and in turn
recruit HP1a; this possibility is supported by work in fission yeast67. In addition to these
core epigenetic factors, Asterix (also known as DmGTSF1), an upstream nuclear factor, is
required for Piwi-directed H3K9 methylation68-70. A recently identified downstream
effector of Piwi, Maelstrom, is not required for the establishment of H3K9 methylation but
is required for the transcriptional silencing of transposable elements63.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several studies have revealed unanticipated epigenetic gene regulation carried out by Piwi.
In Drosophila simulans, maternally deposited piRNAs against the retrotransposon tirant
initiated H3K9-mediated transcriptional gene silencing of this element in the somatic tissues
of developing embryos71. This study shows that maternal germline-derived piRNAs are
required for somatic epigenetic programming. A recent study expanded on this idea by
showing that both maternal and zygotic Piwi are required for establishment of
heterochromatin in non-gonadal somatic cells of the early embryo72. Interestingly, Piwitargeting of transposable elements for silencing means that those genes containing or in
proximity to transposable element sequences may be piRNA pathway targets. The presence
of a transposon or its remnants in an intron or in proximity to a gene correlates with
significant transcriptional repression63,69. Surprisingly, Piwi can also act as an epigenetic
activator. In Drosophila, Piwi establishes euchromatic features of chromosome 3R telomereassociated sequence (3R-TAS)8, and whole-genome studies have shown that Piwi binding
may enhance transcriptional activation marks in multiple regions64. In support of this
unexpected epigenetic function, a recent independent study confirmed that piwi mutant flies
have increased HP1a enrichment in regions, including 3R-TAS, in which Piwi is implicated
as an epigenetic activator72. How can Piwi-binding lead to transcriptional silencing in most
target sites, but activation in a small number of target sites? Perhaps Piwi interacts with
different partners and/or is influenced by the local chromatin micro-environment or its

sublocalization within the nucleus. Clearly, Piwi has many different roles in a variety of
cellular processes, and one challenge in the field is to unite or to further distinguish between
these many functions.

PIWI–piRNA pathway in genome rearrangement
Ciliates are single-celled organisms that possess remarkable nuclear dimorphism. They have
two distinct genomes: a somatic macronucleus that functions in vegetative growth and is
actively transcribed, and a transcriptionally silent germline micronucleus that functions in
the exchange of genetic information during sexual reproduction, known as conjugation.
Following conjugation and mitosis, the zygotic genome in one of the two micronuclei in
each daughter cell is extensively edited to create a new and partial somatic genome that
replaces the parental germline genome, in a process known as genome rearrangement or,
more appropriately, somatic elimination. During somatic elimination, repetitive sequences
are removed from the genome before polyploidization, thus preventing their transcription in
the resultant macronuclei73. Although other organisms have complex mechanisms for
transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing of transposable elements, the ciliates
simply delete such sequences from the somatic macronuclear genome.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Early studies in the ciliate Tetrahymena revealed that their Piwi orthologues are essential for
proper genome rearrangement and piRNA production. These piRNAs, termed scan RNAs in
the original literature, are derived from the micronucleus during conjugation. Importantly,
Tetrahymena piRNAs are distinct from those in other species as they are produced through a
Dicer-dependent mechanism from double-stranded RNA precursors74. In this sense, they are
more like endogenous small interfering RNAs75 (endo-siRNAs). After mating, the piRNAs
provide sequence-specificity to target germline-restricted regions in the developing somatic
macronucleus for elimination (Fig. 3)76; consequent histone methylation then groups these
sequences for collective deletion77. In the current model, for which there is strong evidence
in both Tetrahymena and Paramecium, long non-coding RNAs transcribed from the parental
somatic macronucleus act as sponges for germline-derived piRNAs. Thus, unbound piRNAs
specifically mark any non-somatic regions in the genome for elimination in the developing
daughter macronucleus78.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

By contrast, piRNAs in the ciliate Oxytricha complex with a Piwi orthologue, Otiwi1, to
mark somatic genes for retention during development of the somatic macronucleus. PIWIs
are so crucial to Oxytricha that on knockdown of the mRNA encoding Otiwi1 the organisms
do not survive after mating. Furthermore, injection of RNAs that target normally deleted
genes leads to their retention through multiple sexual generations79. This suggests that
genomic composition changes of the somatic macronucleus are heritable across multiple
generations. In Tetrahymena, the minority of the developing somatic genome is directed for
deletion, whereas in Oxytricha the minority of the developing somatic genome is directed
for retention. Although it is not known why these distantly related species solve this puzzle
of genome rearrangement in opposite ways, it is clear that each has evolved the most
efficient system with the fewest possible piRNA targets to direct the assembly of a complete
somatic macronuclear genome79.

PIWI–piRNA pathway in somatic development
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The PIWI–piRNA pathway has broad developmental functions in diverse organisms, from
memory in the sea slug Aplysia to whole-body regeneration in botryllids. In Aplysia, both
synaptic plasticity and associative memory formation require the PIWI–piRNA pathway.
Aplysia Piwi, in complex with piRNAs, responds to the neurotransmitter serotonin by
directing CpG methylation of the CREB2 promoter. CREB2 is a major inhibitor of memory
in Aplysia, so Piwi-mediated transcriptional silencing of CREB2 results in memory through
long-lasting, cell-wide enhancement of synaptic transmission80. The capacity of the PIWI–
piRNA pathway to epigenetically regulate genes is thus exerted in mature neurons to
promote cellular memory, emphasizing PIWI function in differentiated somatic tissue.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Colonial ascidians are chordates that are capable of whole-body regeneration. Remarkably,
the ascidian Botrylloides leachii can regenerate its entire body from any blood vessel
fragment containing only a few cells. This phenomenon depends on a population of Piwipositive cells present on the luminal side of the vascular epithelium. On RNAi knockdown
of the mRNA encoding Piwi, organisms cannot undergo whole-body regeneration23. In the
closely related Botryllus schlosseri, Piwi is also crucial for whole-body regeneration. Piwi
positive-cells, which contribute to both the germline and somatic lineages of future
generations, reside within the endostyle niche. B. schlosseri undergoes weekly asexual
growth, during which a population of Piwi-positive stem cells vacates the original endostyle
niche and migrates to the niche within the growing daughter organism before the parent
niche undergoes massive apoptosis. In this way, the stem-cell population efficiently
preserves itself over the course of the colony’s lifetime through migration to the offspring24.

Piwi suppresses phenotypic variation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The PIWI–piRNA pathway has a direct role in buffering against phenotypic variation, and
Piwi depletion in Drosophila results in new somatic defects in a random fashion and at low
frequency. Canalization, a term coined by Conrad Waddington in 1942 (ref. 81), describes
developmental robustness: the ability of a system to generate a single phenotype regardless
of genetic or environmental perturbations. The heat-shock protein Hsp90 is a crucial
chaperone in the suppression of phenotypic variation, that is, in canalization. Depletion of
Hsp90 generates diverse somatic phenotypic variants in species ranging from Arabidopsis82
to Drosophila83. These variants are heritable even in the absence of heat shock or other
forms of stress, and even on repletion of the wild-type Hsp90 levels in progeny, indicating
that the effect is not simply due to the chaperone function of Hsp90 during stress.
Drosophila Piwi forms a complex with Hsp90 and the heat-shock organizing protein, Hop,
in vivo to suppress phenotypic variation84.
This buffering of variation is probably accomplished through both genetic and epigenetic
mechanisms. Evidence for a genetic mechanism stems from a study in which Hsp90
depletion in Drosophila leads to defective transposable element silencing by the PIWI–
piRNA pathway. The resultant transposon-mediated mutagenesis may generate new
phenotypes85. However, the transposon mutagenesis hypothesis cannot explain the full
spectrum of canalization phenotypes. Although one copy of maternal piwi is sufficient for

transposon silencing, it is insufficient to suppress phenotypic variation84. In addition,
maternal epigenetic factors, such as the trithorax group of genes that maintain active
chromatin, also buffer against phenotypic variation in Drosophila86. These observations
indicate the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism in suppressing phenotypic variation.
With regards to the inheritance of such phenotypes, work in the Caenorhabditis elegans
germ line has shown that piRNAs induce transgenerational epigenetic inheritance87.
Regardless of the mechanism, the PIWI–piRNA pathway clearly functions to suppress
expression of new phenotypes and to maintain developmental robustness in Drosophila.

The uncertain meaning of PIWI in cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancer stem cells may help to explain resistance to cancer treatment and relapse after
treatment in certain forms of cancer. Thus, great interest exists in developing our
understanding of the basic biology of cancer stem cells and in identifying factors that drive
their stemness. A large number of studies document the ectopic expression of PIWIs in
cancers. This was first reported in seminoma, a testicular germ-cell tumour in which HIWI
was drastically overexpressed32. Related to this overexpression, HIWI mapped to a genomic
region linked to seminomas and non-seminomas. Since then, PIWI expression has been
shown in a variety of somatic cancers: HIWI is expressed in gastric cancer36,88, whereas
HILI is expressed in breast cancer, colon cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, renal cell
carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma33. Some early studies also suggested that PIWI
expression could be used as a prognostic marker35. In both hepatocellular carcinoma34 and
soft-tissue sarcoma35, tumour HIWI expression is associated with increased risk of tumourrelated death. The discovery of PIWI expression in diverse forms of human somatic cancers
opens up a promising area of research, especially given the well-established role of PIWIs in
stem-cell maintenance and self-renewal.
Consistent with this notion, HILI enrichment was reported in a cancer cell subpopulation
expressing the stemness factors OCT4 and NANOG89. In addition, a large variety of
embryonic and developmental genes are expressed in cancers. However, this does not
necessarily imply that they have a causative role in tumorigenesis. Such a conclusion will
need to be based on functional studies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At present, such functional studies are scarce. HILI overexpression in a fibroblast cell line
activates STAT3 and the antiapoptotic factor BCLX, suggesting that HILI might function as
an oncogene33. Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed that piwi mutation attenuates tumour
growth in a sensitized lethal (3) malignant brain tumour (l(3)mbt)-mutant background.
Other piRNA pathway genes were also upregulated in l(3)mbt tumours. These findings are
perhaps the strongest data available at present in correlating ectopic PIWI expression with
tumour growth90.
These preliminary mechanistic data are promising, but research on PIWIs in cancer remains
at an early stage and is primarily correlative. It is known that insertional mutagenesis by
LINE1 elements is common in human epithelial cancers91. Therefore, it is possible that
PIWIs are expressed in reaction to increased transposon activity in cancer, and thus act to
protect the genome. Perhaps an in vivo overexpression model would be a good starting point

to determine whether ectopic or overexpression of a PIWI protein can actually cause cancer,
or is merely a consequence of tumorigenesis. Without a doubt, more large-scale, systematic
research is needed before we can conclude whether or not human PIWIs have any role in
cancer.

Outstanding questions
PIWIs occupy the interface between stem-cell and small RNA biology. They serve diverse
roles in diverse tissues, from totipotent stem cells to totally differentiated cell types, from
the germ line to the soma. Tantalizing questions remain, including how broadly are PIWIs
and piRNAs expressed in mammalian somatic tissues? And, what is their function there, if
any? The mammalian soma awaits our rigorous interrogation. At a more fundamental level,
what are the molecular mechanisms by which Piwi regulates stemness? Conversely, what
exactly is Piwi doing in differentiated tissues? The lower eukaryotes, in which we are
making rapid progress on this topic, provide an excellent arena for these investigations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The reason underlying ectopic expression of PIWIs in many human cancers is still a
mystery. Do PIWIs have a role in cancer? If so, do PIWIs provoke dedifferentiation or lend
a competitive advantage by enhancing stemness or even as a reactive mechanism to suppress
transposition? Finally, are piRNAs ectopically expressed in cancers? If so, what is their
function? Answers to these questions will not only shed light on the function of PIWIs and
piRNAs but could also mark paths that are ripe for cancer research.

Figure 1. piRNA biogenesis in the Drosophila ovarian soma

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

piRNAs are generated from specific genomic loci known as piRNA clusters, which include
flamenco, the 5′ UTRs of mRNAs and traffic jam in the soma. The long single-stranded
piRNA precursor (red) is then exported from the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, the precursors
are processed into mature piRNAs. The precursors are cleaved by an unknown endonuclease
to generate their 5′ end, and transported into the perinuclear Yb body for further processing.
The precursors are loaded onto Piwi in a process that is dependent on Yb, Armitage (Armi)
and Vreteno. Overlapping proteins indicate protein–protein interaction. The co-chaperone
Shutdown plays an uncharacterized, but crucial, part in piRNA loading. The putative
endonuclease Zucchini (Zuc) is required for piRNA maturation and for nuclear localization
of Piwi. Subsequently, piRNAs are trimmed to the appropriate length by an unidentified
exonuclease and 2′-O-methylated at the piRNA 3′ end, rendering them more stable. The
Piwi–piRNA complex is then transported into the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin
state.

Figure 2. Piwi–piRNA mediated epigenetic regulation

Simplified illustrations of the currently proposed models of Piwi-mediated transcriptional
gene silencing. a, In heterochromatin, Piwi may be guided to its target sequences by the
complementarity of its bound piRNA (red) to genomic DNA. On binding, Piwi recruits the
epigenetic modifier HP1a that then recruits the major Drosophila histone methyltransferase
Su(var)3-9, which then deposits a methyl group on the unmethylated histone 3 lysine 9
(H3K9). Through an unknown mechanism, a critical mass of the H3K9 repressive chromatin
marks inhibits Pol II transcription, effectively silencing the Piwi–piRNA target. b, In
euchromatin, Piwi targets nascent transcripts (green) by piRNA sequence complementarity.
Subsequent to this, there are multiple working models. Piwi may directly recruit HP1a,
which in turn recruits a histone methyltransferase (Su(var)3-9 is shown) that then deposits
methyl groups on the unmethylated H3K9. Alternatively, Piwi may directly recruit the
histone methyltransferase, and subsequently HP1a may then bind the methylated H3K9.
Regardless of the mechanism, the net effect is that these repressive marks, in concert with
Maelstrom (not shown), inhibit RNA Pol II transcription.

Figure 3. Somatic genome rearrangement in ciliates

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Unicellular ciliates posses two nuclei: the germline micronucleus and the somatic
macronucleus. After mating, the developing macronucleus is extensively edited to remove
germline-specific sequences. The new mature somatic nucleus contains only genes needed
for somatic (vegetative) growth. The rest of the germline-specific genome (red boxes)
undergoes DNA elimination, an extraordinary method to purge the somatic genome of
repetitive sequences and transposons. This process, called somatic genome rearrangement,
differs between Tetrahymena and Oxytricha. a, Tetrahymena piRNAs (red lines) are
generated by the germ line, and target germline-specific sequences of the developing
somatic macronucleus for elimination. b, Oxytricha piRNAs (blue, orange and purple lines)
are generated by the parent somatic macronucleus, and direct the retention of somatic genes
in the mature somatic macronucleus (blue, orange and purple boxes).
