Abstract:

	
There is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes are involved in
triggering the sequence from chronic liver injury to liver fibrosis, ultimately leading to
liver cancer. In the last years this process has been recapitulated in a growing number
of different mouse models. However, it has remained unclear whether and how these
mouse models reflect the clinical reality of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
	
Research with animal models but also human liver specimens has indicated
that the NF-κB signaling pathway might withhold a crucial function in the
mediation of chronic hepatic inflammation and the transition to HCC in humans.
However, previous studies led to divergent and partly conflicting results with
regards to the functional role of NF-κB in hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we discuss
a new genetic mouse model for HCC, the liver-specific TAK1 knockout mouse,
which lacks the NF-κB activating kinase TAK1 specifically in parenchymal liver
cells. Molecular findings in this mouse model and their possible significance for
chemopreventive strategies against HCC are compared to other murine HCC models.

inflammation induced carcinogenesis, a process whose
molecular underpinnings have largely remained elusive.
Based on the wide range of these features, including
immunology, tumor biology, genetics, metabolomics,
cell biology etc., basic scientists from various research
fields have focused their interest on the examination of
animal HCC models. This will hopefully accelerate the
discovery of new molecular mechanisms involved in
hepatocarcinogenesis, subsequently leading to novel urgently needed - therapeutic strategies against HCC.
Only recently, small inhibitor molecules have
entered clinical practice to treat patients suffering from
HCC. As such, Sorafenib (Nexavar®) is one of the
new therapeutic agents that inhibit both pro-angiogenic
(VEGFR-1, -2, -3; PDGFR-β) and tumorigenic (RET,
Flt-3, c-Kit) receptor tyrosine kinases. Its efficacy in the
context of HCC treatment was demonstrated in two large
phase III clinical trials (SHARP and Asia-Pacific trial),
which were conducted in both Western and Asian countries
[5, 6]. Besides sorafenib, further therapeutic agents like

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the
most common primary carcinoma of the liver [1]. In most
instances, HCC arises in a setting of chronic inflammation
and subsequent liver fibrosis [2]. Besides chronic
alcohol consumption or drug abuse, autoimmunity or
the uptake of liver toxins (e.g. Aflatoxin B1), infections
with Hepatitis B- (HBV) and Hepatitis C-viruses (HCV)
represent the main risk-factors for hepatocarcinogenesis
[3, 4]. The world-wide spread of HBV and HCV not only
in developing but also in industrialized countries has led
to approximately 500 million people persistently infected
with HBV or HCV. This resulted in a strong rise in HCCincidence. Consequently, HCC is the 5th most common
cause for cancer related death world-wide; in some African
or Asian countries HCC is even the first common cause for
cancer related morbidity [3, 4]. In addition to its enormous
clinical relevance, its unique pathophysiological features
have made liver cancer research a field for studying
basic molecular and cellular events driving chronic

regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) are currently investigated for
their potential as anti-liver cancer therapeutics.
However, these new therapeutics “only” prolong
survival and are palliative, while substances that could be
used in an adjuvant setting are still lacking. In addition,
it has to be clearly stated that HCC represent a diverse
spectrum of cancers that will likely need - depending on
the tumor type and tumor stage - different therapeutic
strategies. In summary, systemic therapeutic options for
HCC treatment are currently limited, underlining the need
for new molecular targets. As outlined above, it has been
well established that chronic inflammation and fibrosis
precedes hepatocarcinogenesis. The eradication of the
most common cause of chronic hepatic inflammation
in humans (infection with HBV and HCV) is currently
unattainable. Therefore, identification of central
inflammatory signaling pathways that drive the transition
from chronic liver injury to dysplasia and HCC might
indeed open new possibilities for HCC-chemoprevention
in a setting of chronic hepatitis.
In order to gain a better functional insight into the
molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis, multiple
studies were performed using human HCC tissue. In
the last years, a collection of genetic and epigenetic
alterations, chromosomal aberrations, gene mutations and
altered molecular pathways was described [7]. As such,
chromosomal alterations could be attributed to certain
genes potentially involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, such
as c-Myc (8q), Cyclin A2 (4q), Cyclin D1 (11q), Rb1
(13q), AXIN1 (16p), p53 (17p), IGFR-II/M6PR (6q),
p16 (9p), E-Cadherin (16q), SOCS (16p), and PTEN
(10q) [7, 8]. Further, chromosomal alterations could be
described in HCC, of which amplifications of 1q (58%78%), 6p, 8q, 17q, and 20q, and deletions in 4q, 8p, 13q,
16q, and 17p represented the most frequent ones [9, 10].
However, in many cases it was difficult to assess whether
these alterations represented a correlative epiphenomenon
or if they were causally linked to HCC pathogenesis. In
the light of the apsects mentioned above animal-models
for HCC offer a unique possibility to study mechanistic
and cellular aspects of tumor biology, including genetics
of tumor initiation and promotion, tumor progression
and spreading (metastasis) in vivo. Moreover, animal
models also represent a valuable tool to pre-screen
various therapeutic compounds for their efficacy to inhibit
particular signaling pathways and prevent or decelerate
HCC development.
The fact that inflammatory stimuli promote HCC
development has been recapitulated in various rodent
models and indeed during the last decades different
models of chronic or acute liver damage induced
carcinogenesis (e.g. chemically or genetically) have
been established. One of the best studied chemically
induced HCC-models is the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)
induced liver carcinogenesis, which has been established
in rats and mice [11]. In mice, a single dose of DEN at
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the age of 2 weeks causes DNA-damage, subsequent
acute hepatitis, finally leading to HCC at approximately
8-10 months of age. The DEN rodent model withholds
several advantages: (1) it can easily be administered to
mice from different genetic backgrounds and of different
genotype, (2) it has a high HCC incidence and (3) is highly
reproducible [12]. Moreover, liver tumors from these
mice withhold important features of a malignant cancer,
since they metastasize in the lung. However, the primary
event in DEN-induced carcinogenesis is DNA-damage
leading to genetic mutations in an otherwise healthy
liver. This indicates that - although happening in the
context of acute liver damage - the sequence of primary
DNA-damage and secondary acute inflammation does
not quite reproduce the clinical reality of most patients,
which develop HCC on the basis of chronic hepatitis in
the absence of mutagens. Still, the DEN-rodent model has
revealed crucial molecular and cellular pathways involved
in the development of liver cancer and is a valuable tool
to investigate particular molecules for their potential in
inhibiting or promoting liver cancer formation [12-14].
In contrast to the DEN-rodent model, the Mdr2knockout mouse represents a prototype of a genetically
modified mouse model used to identify the pathways
responsible for chronic inflammation-induced liver
cancer. Mdr2-knockout mice lack a biliary transporter
protein denoted as multi-drug resistance gene 2 (mdr2)
leading to cholestatic hepatitis and liver cancer [15].
Tumor development in the Mdr2-knockout mice
progresses through distinct phases: inflammation,
dysplasia, dysplastic nodules, carcinoma and metastasis,
thus mimicking to some degree the formation of HCC
in humans [16]. A similar sequence of inflammation,
mild fibrosis, dysplasia and HCC formation is observed
in transgenic mice that overexpress the inflammatory
cytokines lymphotoxin a and b (LTab) in the liver
(AlbLTab) [17]. It was demonstrated that lymphotoxin
LTa, b and their receptor (LTbR) are upregulated in livers
of humans with HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC.
Subsequently, liver-specific LTab expression in mice
induced liver inflammation and HCC [17]. In this context
it is important to note that blockage of LTbR signaling
strongly reduced the incidence of chronic hepatitis as well
as abolished liver cancer [17].
The differences between the above mentioned
rodent HCC-models are reflected by distinct, activated
inflammatory signaling pathways leading to inflammation
and hepatocarcinogenesis. One of the most important
and best-studied inflammatory signaling cascades
involved is - indeed - the NF-kB pathway. NF-kB can
be activated by different stimuli like tumor necrosis
factor or Interleukin-1 and controls the transcription
of inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes [18]. One
important step in the activation of NF-kB is represented
by activation of a high-molecular-weight kinase complex,
the so-called IKK complex, consisting of two catalytic
374

How can this contradictory role of IKKb signaling
in HCC formation be reconciled? On the one hand IKKb
signaling might be required for hepatocytes to respond to
and survive carcinogenic stimuli and acute liver injury
(e.g. DEN exposure). On the other hand, IKKb signaling
might enable local chemokine expression by hepatocytes
subsequently leading to chronic inflammation and HCC
(e.g. like in the AlbLTab mouse model). Consistent with
this hypothesis is the finding that AlbLTab x Rag1-/- mice
were devoid of chronic hepatitis, hepatocyte or oval-cell
proliferation and failed to develop HCC.
Why could immune cells be essential for liver
tumorigenesis? One explanation would be that CD4+ or
CD8+ T-cells expressing inflammatory cytokines (e.g.
IL1b, TNF, IFNg) as well as cytolytic proteins (e.g.
Granzyme B) might contribute to hepatocyte cell death
and tissue remodeling and transformation, finally leading
to HCC [20]. Consequently, the role of NF-kB signaling
in hepatocarcinogenesis might depend on the mouse
model and the type or degree of liver inflammation and
injury [21].
To further dissect the role of NF-kB in
hepatocarcinogenesis we recently studied the roles of the
molecules NEMO and TAK1 in hepatocarcinogenesis
[22]. As mentioned above, both of these molecules
are involved in controlling the activation of NF-kB in

subunits, IKK1 (IKKa) and IKK2 (IKKb), as well as a
regulatory subunit called NEMO (IKKg). Upon activation
of this pathway by TNF, the IKK complex is recruited to
adaptor proteins like TRAF2 and RIP1 and is activated by
the kinase TAK1, so it can phosphorylate the inhibitory
protein IkBa and mediate nuclear translocation of NFkB (Fig. 1). In the DEN-rodent model, inhibition of NFkB by conditional liver specific deletion of IKK2 led to
increased liver-tumor formation [19], suggesting that the
proinflammatory NF-kB signaling pathway suppresses
hepatocarcinogenesis. In contrary, inhibition of the NFkB signaling in the Mdr2-knockout mouse led to a strong
decrease in hepatocarcinogenesis compared to mice
with proficient NF-kB signaling, arguing for a tumorpromoter-function of this pathway [16]. Similarly, lack of
NF-kB signaling strongly decreased chronic hepatitis and
prevented hepatocarciniogenesis in the LT ab liver-tumor
model, with the only difference that liver tumor formation
also occurred in the absence of TNFR1 [17]. The reason
for this obvious contradiction between the different
murine HCC models has not been solved, meaning that
it is presently not clear if NF-kB inhibition might be an
option for chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma
in humans. Possibly, suppression of NF-kB signaling
might be only beneficial for particular subtypes of human
HCC – but this will need further investigation.

which in turn phosphorylate IκBα, leading to his proteasomal degradation and releases NF-κB.

various cellular systems [22-24] and are important in
mediating inflammatory signaling pathways. Surprisingly,
conditional deletion of NEMO as well as TAK1 in
hepatocytes (referred to as NEMOLPC-KO and TAK1LPC-KO
mice) leads to spontaneous HCC-development in mice
(Fig. 2A). Hepatocarcinogenesis was preceded by hepatic
inflammation and liver cirrhosis which progresses through
distinct phases (hepatitis, liver fibrosis and dysplasia) to
HCC (Fig. 2B). These findings support the hypothesis that
at least some members of the NF-kB pathway function
as a tumor suppressors, and our further results suggested
that this mainly confers to IKK subunits and molecules
upstream of the IKK-complex. However, it is presently
unclear if these new genetic tumor models mirror any
entity of human HCC.
HCC of TAK1LPC-KO and NEMOLPC-KO mice
were investigated in further detail on genomic
and transcriptional level. Therefore, we compared
chromosomal aberrations in micro-dissected tumors of
TAK1LPC-KO and NEMOLPC-KO mice. Comparative genomic
hybridization analysis (aCGH) revealed that all liver
tumors seen in NEMOLPC-KO mice displayed chromosomal

amplifications in a more or less random manner (data
not shown). In contrast, TAK1LPC-KO mice displayed
defined chromosomal amplifications within certain hotspot-areas on chromosomes 4, 8 and 13 [22]. These
amplifications and deletions of chromosomal regions
ranged from 0.68 megabase (MB) to 151 MB in TAK1LPCKO
tumors and correlated with increased transcription of
certain oncogenes located within the respective amplified
chromosomal regions: Ntrk2, Net1 and Jun. These
findings suggest completely different pathomechanisms
of hepatocarcinogenesis between the TAK1- and NEMOmodels: Although both mice show a defective NF-kBactivation in hepatocytes, only one model is associated
with defined aberrations within certain chromosomal
loci, upregulation of particular oncogenes as well as
different histopathological features. This underlines that
currently unknown molecular pathways downstream
of TNF-associated molecules exist which might couple
inflammation with specific genetic alterations as the basis
for malignant transformation of hepatocytes. In this light,
the new TAK1 model might represent an attractive model
for a deeper understanding of these complex processes in

the future, which might lead to a new chemopreventive
strategy in patients with chronic hepatitis.
Given the rising number of genetic or chemical
murine HCC models, the question remains if all these
models are of significance for the understanding of human
hepatocarcinogenesis and which of these models reflect
which type of HCC in patients. This question could be
addressed by a more systematic approach to compare
specific molecular and genetic features between the
different murine HCC models. As such, chromosomal
aberrations in the various murine models, histopathology,
transcriptional and metabolic changes could be compared
at different stages of tumor initiation and promotion and
correlated with the development of HCC in cirrhotic
transformed livers. The same applies to signalome and
transcriptome analyses or the possible role of hepatic stem
cells during tumorigenesis.
The absence of a curative pharmacological treatment
approach for human HCC and the limitations of the present
molecular inhibitors in the palliative situation clearly
underline the need for the identification of novel target
molecules. The unique inflammation- carcinogenesis
sequence in HCC suggest that such specific inhibitors
against inflammatory signaling pathways may allow to
intercept the continious transition from chronic liver
injury to HCC. A systematic analysis of the various
available murine liver cancer models might be the basis
for the future identification of these potential targets and
might open the door to the successful chemoprevention
against liver cancer.
