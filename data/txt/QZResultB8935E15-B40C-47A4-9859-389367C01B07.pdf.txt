BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) has been adopted as a neoadjuvant regimen for muscle-invasive bladder cancer despite the lack of Level I evidence in this setting. METHODS: Data were collected using an electronic data-capture platform from 28
international centers. Eligible patients had clinical T-classification 2 (cT2) through cT4aN0M0 urothelial cancer of the bladder and
received neoadjuvant GC or methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, plus cisplatin (MVAC) before undergoing cystectomy. Logistic
regression was used to compute propensity scores as the predicted probabilities of patients being assigned to MVAC versus GC given
their baseline characteristics. These propensity scores were then included in a new logistic regression model to estimate an adjusted
odds ratio comparing the odds of attaining a pathologic complete response (pCR) between patients who received MVAC and those
who received GC. RESULTS: In total, 212 patients (146 patients in the GC cohort and 66 patients in the MVAC cohort) met criteria for
inclusion in the analysis. The majority of patients in the MVAC cohort (77%) received dose-dense MVAC. The median age of patients
was 63 years, they were predominantly men (74%), and they received a median of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The pCR
rate was 29% in the MVAC cohort and 31% in the GC cohort. There was no significant difference in the pCR rate when adjusted for
propensity scores between the 2 regimens (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-1.72; P 5.77). In an exploratory analysis
evaluating survival, the hazard ratio comparing hazard rates for MVAC versus GC adjusted for propensity scores was not statistically
significant (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-1.54; P 5.48). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received neoadjuvant GC
and MVAC achieved comparable pCR rates in the current analysis, providing evidence to support what has become routine practice.

Bladder Cancer Neoadjuvant Therapy/Galsky et al

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, approximately 330,000 patients are diagnosed
with bladder cancer each year, and 123,000 patients will die
of the disease.1 The standard management for patients with
muscle-invasive bladder cancer involves radical cystectomy
and pelvic lymph node dissection. Although this treatment
may be curative, a large proportion of patients will develop recurrence and will ultimately die of metastatic disease.2 Several
studies have explored the integration of perioperative chemotherapy in an attempt to eradicate micrometastatic disease
and improve the outcomes achieved with radical cystectomy
alone. Studies have been performed in both neoadjuvant and
adjuvant settings.3 The results from the latter trials generally
have been less compelling, largely as a result of flawed or
underpowered study designs or premature study closure.
However, 2 large randomized trials have demonstrated an
improvement in survival with the integration of neoadjuvant
cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, leading to the
adoption of this approach as a treatment standard.4,5
Despite the survival improvement established in
randomized trials with the use of neoadjuvant methotrexate,
vinblastine, doxorubicin, plus cisplatin (MVAC) or cisplatin,
methotrexate, plus vinblastine5 (CMV), concerns regarding
the balance between the toxicity and efficacy of these regimens has contributed, at least in part, to the poor uptake of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.4-6 In 2000, the results from a
randomized phase 3 trial were published comparing gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) with standard MVAC in patients
with metastatic bladder cancer.7,8 GC was associated with
similar efficacy compared with MVAC, albeit with less toxicity, leading to the adoption of this regimen as among the
most commonly used systemic treatments for patients with
metastatic disease.9 Pragmatically, yet in somewhat of a departure from the evidence-based oncology paradigm, the
results from that trial also have been used to justify the routine
use and integration into practice guidelines of neoadjuvant
GC, despite a lack of prospective randomized data in this setting.10-12 Given the historic difficulties of completing perioperative chemotherapy trials in muscle-invasive bladder cancer,
an adequately powered clinical trial to definitively address
whether neoadjuvant GC is comparable to the regimens supported by Level I evidence (MVAC and CMV) may never be
completed, and additional levels of evidence are needed to
support or refute what has become routine practice.

tive study with a primary objective of describing the patterns of care, management, and outcome of patients with
cancers of the urothelial tract (clinical T-classification 2
[cT2] disease or greater). RISC includes consecutive
patient series from 28 international centers between 2005
and 2012 (some centers included patient data over this
entire period, whereas others included data over a more
limited number of years). Uniform data fields, comprising
baseline characteristics, laboratory and pathology information, treatments, and outcomes, are collected using a
password-protected, secure, web-based, electronic datacapture tool. Training on data abstraction for RISC was
conducted for each participating site using a web-based
tutorial and a comprehensive study training manual.
Quality control consisted of a review of each data field by
the coordinating center (Icahn School of Medicine,
Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY) for missing and
inconsistent data, and data queries were subsequently
completed by each participating site. The study was
approved by the ethics committees at each participating
institution.
Patient inclusion criteria for the current analysis
included a diagnosis of cT2 through cT4aN0M0 urothelial cancer of the bladder. Patients with variant histologies
were included provided that transitional cell carcinoma
was the predominant histology. Patients were excluded if
they had not received any neoadjuvant chemotherapy or if
they had received treatment with regimens other than GC
or MVAC. Patients may have received MVAC in either a
standard or dose-dense fashion.13
Data abstracted for the current analysis included age
at the time of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy regimen, the number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor histology at the time of radical
cystectomy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, year of diagnosis, clinical tumor classification, race, ethnicity, sex, reason for stopping
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, time from last dose of chemotherapy until cystectomy, calculated creatinine clearance
using the Cockroft-Gault formula, pathologic response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and vital status. Detailed toxicity data are not collected in RISC because of the retrospective nature of the data collection.

The primary endpoint of the study was the pathologic
complete response (pCR) rate to neoadjuvant MVAC versus GC. A pCR was defined uniformly in RISC as less
than pathologic T1-classification (pT1) N0 disease at the
time of pathologic evaluation of the cystectomy specimen.
2587

Original Article

It is noteworthy that several studies assessing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer have
used this definition.14,15 Survival between the 2 groups
was analyzed as an exploratory endpoint.
Logistic regression was used to compute propensity
scores as the predicted probabilities of patients being
assigned to MVAC versus GC given their age, calculated
creatinine clearance, number of cycles of chemotherapy
received, pure versus mixed transitional cell carcinoma
histology, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, year of diagnosis, cT-classification, and
sex. These propensity scores were then included in a new
logistic regression model, which was used to estimate an
adjusted odds ratio comparing the odds of attaining a
pCR for patients who received MVAC versus GC.
A second analysis was conducted in which multiple
imputation methods were used to fill in missing data for
patients who had missing values for 1 or more variables
that were included in the propensity scores.16 Five data
sets containing observed and imputed data were constructed. A multivariable logistic regression model was
used to compute propensity scores using data from each
of the 5 data sets. These propensity scores were then
included in each of 5 new logistic regression models and
were used to estimate an adjusted odds ratios (and standard errors) for each of the 5 imputed data sets comparing
the odds of a pCR between patients who received MVAC
versus GC. Finally, the estimated parameters from each
data set were combined using PROC MIANALYZE in
the SAS statistical software program (SAS Institute, Inc,
Cary, NC) to produce an overall propensity scoreadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI).

RESULTS
Study Population

We identified 656 patients in the database who had
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2005 and
2012. Of these, 370 patients did not meet the inclusion
criteria, and an additional 74 patients had missing data.
The final data set was comprised of 212 patients (146 in
the GC cohort and 66 in the MVAC cohort). It is noteworthy that 51 of 66 patients in the MVAC cohort
received the dose-dense schedule of administration. The
full details of the reasons for inclusion and exclusion are
provided in Figure 1. A secondary analysis included all
286 patients (202 in the GC cohort and 84 in the MVAC
cohort) for whom missing patient data were imputed.
The patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
The median age of the cohort was 63 years, and the major2588

ity of patients were men. The median creatinine clearance
was significantly higher in patients who had received
MVAC. A greater proportion of patients in the MVAC
cohort had received treatment in recent years, probably
reflecting the dose-dense schedule of administration used.
Data pertaining to the number of lymph nodes retrieved
at the time of cystectomy were available only for a subset
of patients. In that subset, patients who received MVAC
had a higher number of lymph nodes removed compared
with those who received CG (n 5 55 patients in each
cohort; 21 lymph nodes vs 16 lymph nodes, respectively;
P 5 .0017).
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

The details of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration
are provided in Table 2. Both groups received a median of
3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The reasons for
treatment discontinuation and the times from completion
of chemotherapy to cystectomy were similar between the
2 cohorts. It is noteworthy that 111 patients received nonstandard regimens (characterized as regimens other than
CG and dose-dense or standard MVAC). These regimens
are summarized in Table 3.
pCR Rate

In the full cohort of 212 patients, 64 (30%) achieved a
pCR, including 45 of 146 patients (31%) who received
GC and 19 of 66 patients (29%) who received MVAC.
The pCR rate was subsequently adjusted for propensity
scores, as indicated in Table 4. There was no significant
difference in the odds of achieving a pCR with MVAC
versus GC (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.48-1.83;
P 5 .86). Similar results were obtained when multiple
imputation methods were used to fill in missing data for
patients who had missing values for 1 or more variables
(imputed odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.70-1.28;
P 5 .74).
Survival

In an exploratory analysis, there was no significant difference in the overall survival of patients who received neoadjuvant MVAC versus GC (Kaplan-Meier 25th
percentile: 35.5 months vs 26.8 months, respectively;
P 5 .17). The hazard ratio (HR) comparing hazard rates
for MVAC versus GC adjusted for propensity scores was
not statistically significant (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.401.54; P 5 .48) (Table 5). Similar results were obtained
when multiple imputation methods were used to fill in
missing data for patients who had missing values for 1 or
more variables (imputed HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.57-1.64;
P 5 .90).

DISCUSSION
Neoadjuvant GC has become a standard treatment
approach in muscle-invasive urothelial cancer of the bladder and is supported by practice guidelines, despite limited prospective, single-arm data and absent prospective,
randomized data in this clinical setting.10-12 The current
analysis, which is among the largest data sets to date
exploring treatment with neoadjuvant GC, demonstrates
similar pCR rates with neoadjuvant MVAC versus GC after adjusting for propensity scores.
A single published prospective study explored neoadjuvant GC in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.17 That
22-patient, single-arm, single-center study reported a
pCR rate of 26%. A 31-patient, multicenter, prospective
study of neoadjuvant GC administered using a dosedense schedule was recently presented in abstract form
and reported a pCR rate of 32% (95% CI, 16%-48%).18
Several prior retrospective analyses have reported pCR
rates and outcomes with neoadjuvant GC in muscleinvasive bladder cancer.14,15,19-22 The majority of those
prior analyses have been relatively small, singleinstitutional experiences. Nonetheless, with the exception
Cancer

of a single study, the pCR rates with neoadjuvant GC
reported in those prior analyses have been similar to those
reported in the current study.22,23 A few of the prior analyses also have reported comparisons of the pCR rate
between GC and MVAC but have done so by including
the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen as a variable in a
standard multivariate model rather than by using propensity scores and have involved relatively small
cohorts.20,21,24 Propensity scores are used to estimate the
effect of an intervention by accounting for the covariates
that predict the receipt of a particular intervention,
thereby reducing bias because of confounding variables.25
An advantage to using propensity scores, particularly for
small to moderate sized data sets, is that, by using a linear
combination of covariates for a single score, the treatment
groups can be balanced based on a large number of covariates.26 Thus, the propensity score attempts to create conditions similar to randomization to establish a causal
connection between the intervention and the outcome.
Furthermore, propensity scores allow investigators to
clearly define a treatment population in the presence of
treatment effect heterogeneity, which cannot be achieved

with conventional multivariable models, and also to check
the performance of the model by assessing covariate balance across treatment groups.27 The concordance between
estimates of treatment effect when using propensity scores
from observational studies and estimates derived from
randomized trials is of interest and has been explored in
prior analyses. Although several such studies have demonstrated concordance, these examples do not prove that a
propensity score approach is guaranteed to produce valid
estimates of treatment effect, but they do demonstrate
that it is possible to estimate treatment effects of an intervention using observational data similar to the effects that
would result from a randomized trial.28,29
Two single-arm, prospective studies have recently
reported promising activity with the administration of
neoadjuvant, dose-dense MVAC, with pT0 rates from
26% to 38%.30,31 A retrospective analysis of 80 consecutive patients who received dose-dense MVAC also generated consistent results.32 Indeed, several of the centers
involved in those studies contributed patient data to
RISC, accounting for the predominance of dose-dense
MVAC in our MVAC cohort. Although the majority of
patients (77%) received dose-dense MVAC in our analysis, no significant difference in the pCR rate was observed
between neoadjuvant GC and MVAC.

There are limitations to the current analysis. This
was a retrospective analysis and was subject to all of the
potential biases associated with such an approach. However, propensity score analysis was used in an attempt to
minimize potential bias caused by confounding variables.
Still, propensity scores cannot adjust for unknown (and
consequently unmeasured) confounding variables. In
addition, although important covariates like functional

status were included, detailed data on comorbidities were
not available. Furthermore, the duration of follow-up was
not consistent across centers, and precise data related to
relative dose intensity were not available. Although we
generated a data set from a large number of international
centers, only academic centers contributed data to RISC,
potentially impacting the generalizability of the findings.
An intermediate endpoint, the pCR rate, was used as the
primary endpoint of the analysis rather than progressionfree or overall survival. Although it has not been formally
established as a surrogate endpoint, the pCR rate has been
correlated with overall survival in several analyses that
included the specific definition of pCR rate used in the
current study.4,33 The pivotal trial comparing neoadjuvant MVAC followed by surgery versus surgery alone in
patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Southwest
Oncology Group trial SWOG 8710) demonstrated that
patients who had no residual disease at the time of surgery
(pT0) had a markedly improved overall survival compared with those who had >pT0 disease (HR, 2.51; 95%
Cancer

August 1, 2015

CI, 1.47-4.27; P 5 .0008).33 A correlation between the
pCR rate and clinical outcomes also was demonstrated in
previous analyses of neoadjuvant GC.23 Progression-free
survival data were not analyzed given the lack of uniform
follow-up in this retrospective cohort. Of 656 patients
retrieved in the initial query, 74 patients had missing data
for the variables used in the propensity score analysis.
However, imputation of missing values did not have an
impact on the primary results of the analysis. Although no
significant difference in the pCR rate was observed
between patients receiving MVAC versus GC, noninferiority of GC cannot be addressed in this retrospective
analysis. However, this would be a potential endpoint if a
prospective study addressing this clinical question were
feasible. Finally, the current analysis relied on investigator
review of pathology reports, and there was no central pathology review of cystectomy specimens.
The current analysis attempts to address a major dilemma in the clinical care of patients with bladder cancer:
that is, confirmation of a practice that has been adopted as

a setting in which an adequately powered, prospective,
randomized trial is unlikely to ever be completed. A
recently initiated Southwest Oncology Group trial
(SWOG 1314) is randomizing patients with muscleinvasive bladder cancer to neoadjuvant GC versus dosedense MVAC.34 However, that trial is not designed to
compare the 2 regimens but, rather, to determine the utility of a gene expression model-based biomarker approach
in predicting pCR. Other approaches, such as observational studies or pragmatic clinical trials, could be considered. However, in the absence of such studies, the results
of the current analysis provide additional evidence to support the use of GC in the neoadjuvant setting given the
similar pCR rate achieved compared with MVAC.
