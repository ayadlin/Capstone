Abstract
In cancer management, the cyclooxygenase (COX)–targeted
approach has shown great promise in anticancer therapeutics.
However, the use of COX-2 inhibitors has side effects and
health hazards; thus, targeting its major metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)–mediated signaling pathway might be a
rational approach for the next generation of cancer management. Recent studies on several in vitro and in vivo models
have revealed that elevated expression of COX-2 correlates
with prostate tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this study,
we have shown the in-depth molecular mechanism and the
PGE2 activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and
B3 integrin through E prostanoid 2 (EP2)–mediated and
EP4-mediated pathways, which lead to activator protein-1
(AP-1) activation. Moreover, PGE2 also induces activating
transcription factor-4 (ATF-4) activation and stimulates crosstalk between ATF-4 and AP-1, which is unidirectional toward
AP-1, which leads to the increased expressions of urokinasetype plasminogen activator and vascular endothelial growth
factor and, eventually, regulates prostate tumor cell motility.
In vivo Matrigel angiogenesis assay data revealed that PGE2
induces angiogenesis through EP2 and EP4. Human prostate
cancer specimen analysis also supported our in vitro and
in vivo studies. Our data suggest that targeting PGE2 signaling
pathway (i.e., blocking EP2 and EP4 receptors) might be a
rational therapeutic approach for overcoming the side effects
of COX-2 inhibitors and that this might be a novel strategy for
the next generation of prostate cancer management. [Cancer

Introduction
Treatment of cancer by chemotherapeutic agents is considered
one of the most effective approaches in cancer management in
recent times. Earlier reports have depicted that reduced apoptosis,
increased neovascularization, and immunosuppression are some of
the known consequences of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression, and each effect could have an important role in tumor
progression and angiogenesis (1). Several selective and nonselective
COX-2 inhibitors have been in use for the treatment of different
cancers, but many questions have arisen regarding their side effects
(2). Various studies have shown the correlation between COX-2
overexpression and enhanced production of prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) by cancer cells (3). It has been reported that the rate of
PGE2 conversion from arachidonic acid is almost 10-fold higher in
malignant prostatic tissues than in benign prostatic tissues (4).

Thus, the concerns regarding the safety of these COX-2 inhibitors,
as well as the identification of the more effective therapeutic
agents, prompted us to understand the downstream signaling
events regulated by PGE2 in prostate cancer, which might help to
develop new therapeutic approach in the treatment of prostate
cancer.
PGE2 interacts with the E prostanoid (EP) family of receptors,
which consist four different subtypes (EP1–EP4). The enhanced
expressions of EP2 and EP4 receptors have been shown in prostate
cancer, as well as in endothelial cells (5, 6). In this study, we have
examined the role of PGE2-mediated signaling during prostate
cancer progression and suggested that blocking the interaction
between PGE2 and its receptors, rather than global prostaglandin
synthesis by using specific COX-2 inhibitors, might circumvent
some of the adverse side effects. Recently, we have shown that the
chemokine-like protein, osteopontin, induces COX-2–dependent
PGE2-mediated prostate cancer progression (7). However, the
molecular mechanism by which PGE2 directly regulates prostate
cancer progression and angiogenesis is not well defined.
Previous studies have shown that PGE2 augments cyclic AMP
(cAMP) production (8), increases cellular growth, and regulates
differentiated cell functions by promoting the activation of cAMPdependent protein kinase A (PKA). The PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and
regulation of transcription via interaction between cAMP-response
elements with CREB are considered as the major pathways that
alter gene expression in cancer cells (9, 10). Earlier studies have
revealed that activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4; also called
CREB-2) regulates the expression of genes involved in oxidative
stress, amino acid synthesis, differentiation, metastasis, and
angiogenesis (11). It has been reported that the expression of
ATF-4 is induced by various external stimuli in cancer microenvironment and regulates various processes that control cancer
progression (11), but the function of ATF-4 in prostate cancer
progression remains unknown.
The overexpression of proteases often correlates with the
enhanced tumor cell invasion and metastasis by virtue of
degradation of extracellular matrix and basement membranes in
almost all malignancies, including prostate cancer (12, 13).
Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a protease, plays an
important role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis (14).
Increased expressions of uPA and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) have been reported in malignancies of various
organs including prostate (14, 15), and the increased expression of
these molecules is associated with an enhanced metastatic and
angiogenic potential and poor survival of patients (16). Earlier data
have shown that the response elements for activator protein 1
(AP-1) and ATF-4 are present in the promoter region of uPA and
VEGF (17–20). Although it has been reported that PGE2 plays a
crucial role in VEGF production in prostate cancer cells (21), the
molecular mechanism by which PGE2 regulates ATF-4/AP-1–
mediated uPA and VEGF expressions, which lead to prostate
tumor cell motility and in vivo angiogenesis, remains unknown.

PGE2-Dependent Tumor Progression and Angiogenesis

In this study, we have shown that PGE2 triggers mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK1/2 signaling through activation
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and augments
expression and activation of h3 integrin in prostate cancer cells.
Moreover, we have shown that PGE2 induces the activation of ATF4 and AP-1 via EGFR-MEK-ERK1/2 or h3 integrin–mediated
pathway, which ultimately leads to the increased expressions of
uPA and VEGF. Furthermore, we have observed that PGE2 regulates
endothelial cell motility and in vivo angiogenesis. Analysis of
human prostate clinical samples showed that the expression
profiles of EP2 and EP4 receptors correlated with levels of AP-1,
ATF-4, uPA, and VEGF. These data suggested that, at least in part,
PGE2 plays a crucial role in the oncogenesis and angiogenesis of
prostate cancer. Thus, targeting PGE2 receptor–mediated signaling
might be a potential approach for the improved prostate cancer
therapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection. Human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3,
DU-145, and LNCaP) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) was purchased from
Cambrex. COX-2 cDNA (Dr. Stephen Prescott, University of Utah), wild-type
(wt) and dominant-negative (dn) ATF-4 (wt, pEF/mATF-4; dn, pEF/mATF4M; Dr. Javed Alam, Yale University School of Medicine), and A Fos (Dr.
Charles Vinson, National Cancer Institute) were transfected in PC-3 cells
using Lipofectamine 2000.
Small interfering RNA. PC-3 cells were transfected with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets COX-2 (COX-2 siRNA,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), EP2 (ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool PTGER2; L005712-00), EP4 (siGENOME SMARTpool PTGER4; M-005714-00), human
integrin h3 (siGENOME SMARTpool ITGB3; M-004124-02), and control
siRNA (siGENOME nontargeting siRNA; D-001206-14-05 and ON-TARGET
plus nontargeting pool; D-001810-10-05; Dharmacon) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blot and EMSA. The Western blot and EMSA experiments were
performed as described earlier (7, 22).
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence studies were performed
using specific antibodies as described earlier (22, 23).
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry experiments were performed as
described (24).
Reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was isolated from PC-3 cells and
analyzed by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). The following primers
were used: uPA sense, 5¶-CAC GCA AGG GGA GAT GAA-3¶; uPA antisense,
5¶-ACA GCA TTT TGG TGG TGA CTT-3¶; VEGF sense, 5¶-CCT CCG AAA CCA
TGA ACT TT-3¶; VEGF antisense, 5¶-AGA GAT CTG GTT CCC GAA AC-3¶;
h-actin sense, 5¶-GGC ATC CTC ACC CTG AAG TA-3¶; h-actin antisense,
5¶-GGG GTG TTG AAG GTC TCA AA-3¶. The amplified cDNA fragments were
analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Cell migration and comigration assay. The migration and comigration
experiments were performed as described (22). Briefly, PC-3 cells, either
alone or individually transfected with dn ATF-4, dn c-Jun, and A-Fos or
pretreated with PKA inhibitor peptide, were added to the upper chamber of
the Boyden chamber. PGE2 was added in the upper chamber. For
comigration assay, PC-3 cells, either alone or transfected with COX-2 cDNA
or COX-2 siRNA, were used in the lower chamber. Endothelial (HUVEC)
cells, either alone or pretreated with EP2 (AH6809, Sigma) or EP4 (AH23848,
Sigma) receptor antagonist, were used in the upper chamber. The migrated
endothelial cells to the reverse side of the upper chamber were fixed and
stained with Giemsa and counted in three high-power fields under an
inverted microscope (Nikon). Data are represented as the average of three
counts F SE.
Wound assay. Wound assays were performed using PC-3 and endothelial
cells as described earlier (7). Wounds with a constant diameter were made.

PC-3 cells were treated with PGE2 alone or pretreated with EP2 or EP4
receptor antagonist or PKA inhibitor peptide, or transfected with dn ATF-4,
dn c-Jun, A-Fos and then treated with PGE2. In separate experiments,
endothelial cells were treated with PGE2 alone or pretreated with EP2 or
EP4 receptor antagonist and then treated with PGE2. After 12 h, wound
photographs were taken through a microscope (Nikon).
In vivo Matrigel plug assay. In vivo Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay
was carried out, as described previously (22). Briefly, Matrigel, either alone
or along with PGE2, was injected s.c. into the ventral groin region of male
athymic NMRI (nu/nu) mice. In separate experiments, PGE2 containing
Matrigel was mixed with EP2 or EP4 antagonist (30 Amol/L) and injected
into the mice. In another experiment, conditioned medium of PC-3 cells,
either nontransfected or transfected with COX-2 cDNA, was mixed with
Matrigel and injected into the mice. After 21 d, mice were sacrificed,
dissected out, and photographed. The Matrigel plugs were excised and used
for immunohistochemistry. The paraffin sections were immunostained with
anti-vWF (Chemicon), anti-CD31 (Chemicon), anti–phosphorylated p65,
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti–phosphorylated Akt (Santa Cruz) antibodies and visualized under confocal
microscope (Ziess).
Human prostate cancer specimen analysis. Specimens of different
Gleason grades and normal tissues of prostate were collected from a local
hospital with informed consent and analyzed by immunohistochemistry as
described (7). The expression profiles of EP2, EP4, ATF-4, c-Jun, c-Fos, uPA,
and VEGF were detected by immunohistochemistry using their specific
antibodies. Five specimens from each group [normal, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and malignant] were analyzed.
Statistical analysis. The data reported in cell migration, comigration,
in vivo Matrigel plug angiogenesis, and the clinical specimen analysis are
expressed as mean F SE. Statistical differences were determined by
Student’s t test. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. All bands
were analyzed densitometrically (Kodak Digital Science), and fold changes
were calculated. The in vivo angiogenesis and clinical specimen data were
quantified using the Image Pro Plus 6.0 Software (Nikon).

Results
PGE2 augments EP2/EP4-mediated EGFR/MAPK and B3
integrin activation in prostate cancer cells. To examine the
effect of PGE2 on EGFR, MEK, ERK1/2, and h3 integrin
phosphorylation, serum-starved PC-3 cells were treated with
PGE2 in a dose (0–1.0 Amol/L)–dependent and time (0–60
minutes)–dependent manner. The levels of phosphorylation of
these signaling molecules were analyzed by Western blot using
their phosphorylated-specific antibodies. The data indicated
that PGE2 induces phosphorylation of EGFR, MEK, ERK1/2, and
h3 integrin, and maximum phosphorylations were observed
between 10 and 15 minutes (Fig. 1A) with 0.5 Amol/L of
PGE2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, the effect of PGE2 on
the activation of these signaling molecules (EGFR, MEK, ERK, and
h3 integrin) was examined in other prostate cancer (DU-145 and
LNCaP) cells. The data showed significant phosphorylations of
these molecules in DU-145 compared with LNCaP cells in response
to PGE2 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Previous reports have shown
that PC-3 cells express higher levels of EP2 and EP4 receptors (21).
Therefore, to examine the involvement of EP2 and EP4 receptors in
PGE2-induced EGFR and h3 integrin phosphorylation, PC-3 cells
were pretreated with EP2 (AH6809) or EP4 (AH23848) receptor
antagonist in a dose-dependent manner (0–30 Amol/L) for 1 hour
and then treated with PGE2, and the levels of phosphorylated EGFR
and phosphorylated h3 integrin were analyzed by Western blot.
AH6809 or AH23848 at 30 Amol/L concentration showed maximum
inhibition of PGE2-induced EGFR and h3 integrin phosphorylation
(Fig. 1B, I and II). To examine whether EP2 and EP4 receptor

agonists mimic the effect of PGE2 and regulate the downstream
molecular events, PC-3 cells were treated with butaprost (EP2
agonist) and PGE1 alcohol (EP4 agonist) and phosphorylated EGFR
and phosphorylated h3 integrin were analyzed. The data showed
that both the agonists induce the phosphorylation of EGFR and h3
integrin (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). These data revealed that
PGE2 induces the phosphorylation of EGFR and h3 integrin
through EP2 and EP4 receptors–mediated process. Recently, it has
been reported that PGE2 induces h1 integrin expression in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells (25). To determine whether PGE2
regulates the expression of h3 integrin in prostate cancer cells, PC3 cells were treated with PGE2 for 12 hours and the expression of
h3 integrin was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). To determine
the roles of EP2 and EP4 receptors in PGE2-induced h3 integrin
expression, PC-3 cells were pretreated with AH6809 or AH23848
and then treated with PGE2, and expression of h3 integrin was
analyzed by immunofluorescence. The data showed that AH6809
and AH23848 suppressed the PGE2-induced h3 integrin expression,

indicating that EP2 and EP4 receptors play crucial roles in
regulating this process (Fig. 1D). These data suggested that PGE2
does not only stimulate EGFR and h3 integrin phosphorylation but
also induces the expression of h3 integrin via EP2/EP4 receptor–
mediated pathway.
EGFR and B3 integrin play crucial roles in PGE2-induced
AP-1 activation. Earlier studies have shown the role of AP-1 in
prostate cancer progression (26, 27). Activation of AP-1 involves the
increased expression or activation of Jun and Fos proteins (28–30).
To examine the effect of PGE2 on c-Fos and c-Jun expression/
activation, PC-3 cells were treated with PGE2, and expressions of cFos and phosphorylation of c-Jun were analyzed by Western blot
and immunofluorescence, whereas AP-1–DNA binding was performed by EMSA. The results revealed that PGE2 does not only
augment the expression of c-Fos and phosphorylation of c-Jun
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3A) but also stimulates the AP-1–
DNA binding (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Furthermore, to study the
role of EGFR/MAPK or h3 integrin on PGE2-induced AP-1

PGE2, and h3 integrin expression was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti–h3 integrin antibody. D, PC-3 cells were pretreated with AH6809 or AH23848 and then
treated with PGE2, and the level of h3 integrin was analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-h3 integrin antibody followed by staining with Cy2-conjugated IgG
(green ). Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (PI, red). All figures are representation of three experiments. Fold changes were calculated.

Figure 2. PGE2 induces EP2/EP4-mediated EGFR/MAPK or h3 integrin–dependent c-Fos expression and c-Jun phosphorylation and enhances colocalization of
ATF-4 with phosphorylated c-Jun. A, PC-3 cells were treated with 0.5 Amol/L of PGE2 for 0 to 150 min, and the levels of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun were detected
by Western blot. Total c-Jun and actin were used as loading controls. B, PC-3 cells were pretreated with PD98059 (MEK inhibitor; 40 Amol/L) or AG1478 (EGFR
inhibitor; 500 nmol/L) for 1 h and then treated with PGE2. c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun were analyzed by Western blot (I ). PC-3 cells were individually transfected
with h3 siRNA or control siRNA and then treated with PGE2, and the levels of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun were analyzed (II). C, PC-3 cells were treated with PGE2,
and the colocalization of phosphorylated c-Jun (stained with Cy2; green ) and ATF-4 (stained with Cy3; red ) was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Nuclei were
counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue ). D, ATF-4 regulates PGE2-induced expression of c-Fos and phosphorylation of c-Jun. PC-3 cells were
transfected with wt and dn ATF-4 and then treated with PGE2, and the levels of c-Fos, phosphorylated c-Jun, and c-Jun were analyzed by Western blot. All figures are

inhibitor) or AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor) or transfected with h3
integrin siRNA and expression of c-Fos and levels of the
phosphorylated c-Jun were analyzed by Western blot. The data
showed that inhibition of EGFR-MAPK pathway or downregulation of h3 integrin suppressed PGE2-induced c-Fos expression and c-Jun phosphorylation, indicating that PGE2 triggers
EGFR-MAPK and h3 integrin–mediated AP-1 activation (Fig. 2B,
I and II). Altogether, these results suggested that EGFR and h3
integrin play crucial roles in PGE2-induced AP-1 activation in PC-3
cells.

PGE2 stimulates ATF-4–dependent AP-1 activation. Elevated
expression of ATF-4 has been observed in various cancers
associated with enhanced malignancy (11). Recent findings have
shown that ATF-4 is also involved in the regulation of expression of
various oncogenic molecules and plays a crucial role in cancer
progression (11). Therefore, we have examined the expression of
ATF-4 in PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP cells by immunofluorescence.
The results showed the significant level of ATF-4 expression,
particularly in PC-3 and DU-145 cells (data not shown). To
investigate the role of PGE2 on ATF-4 activation, PC-3 cells were
treated with PGE2 and ATF-4 nuclear localization and DNA binding

Figure 3. PGE2 augments EP2/EP4 receptor–mediated ATF-4/AP-1–dependent uPA and VEGF expression in PC-3 cells. A, PC-3 cells were treated with 0.5 Amol/L
PGE2 for 0 to 24 h, and the levels of uPA and VEGF were detected by Western blot using their specific antibodies. Actin was used as loading control. B, cells

the levels of uPA, VEGF, EP2, and EP4 were analyzed by Western blot. Actin was used as loading control. D, roles of ATF-4 and AP-1 in PGE2-induced uPA and VEGF

were determined by immunofluorescence and EMSA. The data
indicated that PGE2 induces nuclear localization and DNA binding
of ATF-4 (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). Moreover, we have
observed the enhanced nuclear colocalization of ATF-4 with
phosphorylated c-Jun in response to PGE2 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore,
to explore the cross-talk between ATF-4 and AP-1, PC-3 cells were
individually transfected with wt or dn ATF-4, followed by treatment
with PGE2. The levels of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun
expressions were analyzed by Western blot. The data indicated
that wt ATF-4 enhances, whereas dn ATF-4 suppresses, PGE2induced c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun expression (Fig. 2D).
EMSA data further confirmed that ATF-4 regulates AP-1–DNA
binding in response to PGE2 (Supplementary Fig. S4C). However,
wt and dn c-Jun or A-Fos had no effect on PGE2-induced ATF-4–
DNA binding (data not shown), which further suggested that PGE2regulated cross-talk between ATF-4 and AP-1 is unidirectional
toward AP-1.
PGE2 induces EP2/EP4-mediated uPA and VEGF expressions
in prostate cancer cells. To examine the role of PGE2 on uPA and
VEGF expressions, PC-3 cells were treated with PGE2 in a timedependent (0–24 h) and dose-dependent (0–1.0 Amol/L) manner.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

The levels of uPA and VEGF were analyzed by Western blot. The
results indicated that PGE2 with 0.5 Amol/L concentration induced
maximum expressions of uPA and VEGF at f16 hours (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Fig. S5A). Similarly, PGE2 at 0.5 Amol/L concentration stimulated maximum uPA and VEGF expressions at mRNA
levels (Fig. 3B). The PGE2-induced uPA and VEGF expressions were
also detected in DU-145 and LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
The data indicated that PGE2 up-regulates uPA and VEGF
expressions, both at transcriptional and protein levels. Earlier
reports have indicated that COX-2 regulates PGE2 production in
prostate tumor cells (3). Therefore, to determine the role of tumorderived PGE2 on uPA and VEGF expressions, PC-3 cells were
transfected with COX-2 cDNA or COX-2 siRNA (COX-2i) and
expressions of uPA and VEGF were detected by Western blot. The
data showed that overexpression of COX-2 enhances, whereas
silencing of COX-2 suppresses, uPA and VEGF expressions
(Supplementary Fig. S5C), which further suggested that tumorderived PGE2 is also involved in the regulation of uPA and VEGF
expressions in these cells. To delineate the roles of EP2 and EP4
receptors in PGE2-induced uPA and VEGF expressions, PC-3 cells
were transfected with EP2 or EP4 siRNA (EP2i or EP4i) and then

treated with PGE2. The levels of uPA, VEGF, EP2, and EP4 were
analyzed by Western blot. The data indicated that silencing of EP2
or EP4 receptor suppresses PGE2-induced uPA and VEGF
expressions (Fig. 3C). Moreover, to examine the roles of ATF-4
and AP-1 on PGE2-induced uPA and VEGF expressions, PC-3 cells
were transfected with dn ATF-4 or dn c-Jun or A-Fos cDNA
construct and then treated with PGE2, and the levels of uPA and
VEGF were analyzed by Western blot. The data revealed that dn
ATF-4, dn c-Jun, or A-Fos suppressed PGE2-induced uPA and VEGF
expressions (Fig. 3D), demonstrating the roles of AP-1 and ATF-4 in
PGE2-induced uPA and VEGF expressions. Taken together, these
data indicated that both exogenous and tumor-derived PGE2
induced uPA and VEGF expressions via EP2 and EP4 receptors–
mediated ATF-4–dependent and AP-1–dependent pathway.
ATF-4 and AP-1 regulate PGE2-induced prostate tumor cell
motility. It has been reported that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory

drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors suppress invasiveness of
human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, and this effect
can be reversed by the addition of PGE2 (31). Although it has been
proposed that overexpression of COX-2/PGE2 may enhance the
invasive properties of tumors (3), leading to increase in tumor cell
migration, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not
well defined. Therefore, to delineate the molecular mechanism of
PGE2-regulated tumor cell migration, PC-3 cells were either
individually transfected with dn ATF-4, dn c-Jun, and A-Fos or
pretreated with AH6809, AH23848, and PKA inhibitor peptide and
then treated with PGE2, and wound migration assay was
performed. These data showed that antagonists of EP2 and EP4
receptors, PKA inhibitor peptide, dn ATF-4, dn c-Jun, and A Fos
significantly suppressed PGE2-induced tumor cell migration
(Fig. 4A, I and II). The roles of these molecules in PGE2-mediated
PC-3 cell migration were further confirmed by migration assay

were taken at 0 and 12 h (I and II ). B, PGE2 controls Akt and p65, NF-nB phosphorylation in endothelial (HUVEC) cells. HUVEC were treated with PGE2 for 0 to

pretreated with AH6809 or AH23848 and then treated with PGE2. The levels of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated p65 were analyzed by Western blot. Total Akt
and p65 were used as control. Data represent three experiments exhibiting similar results. Fold changes were calculated.

using Boyden chamber (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Taken together,
the results showed that PGE2 regulates ATF-4/AP-1–dependent
prostate tumor cell motility through interaction with EP2 and EP4
receptors.
PGE2 induces EP2/EP4-mediated Akt/NF-KB activation in
endothelial cells, tumor-endothelial cell interaction, and
angiogenesis. NF-nB regulates the expression of various factors
that control endothelial and tumor cell motility and invasion (32).
The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt is an important component in the migratory and prosurvival signaling pathways (33).
Therefore, to examine the effect of PGE2 on the activation of NF-nB
and Akt, endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with PGE2 in a
time-dependent manner and the levels of phosphorylated Akt and
phosphorylated p65 and NF-nB were analyzed by Western blot. The
data showed that PGE2 induces the phosphorylations of Akt and
p65 in these cells (Fig. 4B). To examine the role of EP2 or EP4
receptor on PGE2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and p65, HUVEC
were pretreated with AH6809 and AH23848 and then treated with
PGE2, and the levels of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated
p65 were analyzed. The data showed that EP2 and EP4 receptor
antagonists suppressed PGE2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and
p65, suggesting that EP2 and EP4 play crucial roles in this process
(Fig. 4C). To examine the roles of EP2 and EP4 on PGE2-mediated
endothelial cell motility, wound migration assay was performed.
The data indicated that EP2, as well as EP4 receptor antagonists,
suppressed PGE2-induced endothelial cell motility (Supplementary
Fig. S6B).
Various studies have indicated that overexpression of COX-2 and
PGE2 correlates with tumor angiogenesis (3, 7, 34). To determine
the role of tumor-derived PGE2 on endothelial cell motility, direct
comigration assay was performed. PC-3 cells, either alone or
transfected with wt COX-2 cDNA or COX-2 siRNA, were used in the
lower chamber, whereas HUVEC, either alone or pretreated with
EP2 or EP4 receptor antagonist, were used in the upper chamber.
In separate experiments, PGE2 was used in the lower chamber as
positive control. The endothelial cells migrated toward the reverse
side of the upper chamber were stained with Giemsa, photographed, counted, and represented in the form of a bar graph
(Fig. 5A). The data revealed that overexpression of COX-2
significantly enhanced, whereas silencing COX-2 or antagonists of
EP2 or EP4 receptor drastically suppressed, endothelial cell motility
toward tumor cells, suggesting that tumor-derived PGE2 plays a
crucial role in this process (Fig. 5A).
To examine the effect of PGE2 on in vivo tumor angiogenesis,
Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay was performed. Accordingly,
PGE2 was mixed with growth factor depleted Matrigel alone or
along with EP2 or EP4 receptor antagonists and Matrigel and
injected into the nude mice. After the termination of the
experiments, Matrigel plugs were photographed and analyzed by
immunohistochemistry using anti-CD31, anti-vWF, anti–phosphorylated p65, and anti–phosphorylated Akt antibodies. The
results showed that PGE2-induced angiogenesis was inhibited by
EP2 or EP4 receptor antagonist (Fig. 5B). The expressions of vWF
and CD31 (endothelial cell markers) and phosphorylations of
p65, NF-nB, and Akt were higher in PGE2-treated plugs compared
with the plugs developed with EP2 and EP4 receptor antagonists
(Fig. 5B). In other experiments, conditioned medium of PC-3 cells,
either nontransfected or transfected with COX-2 cDNA, was mixed
with Matrigel and injected into the mice. The Matrigel plugs
generated from the conditioned medium of COX-2 overexpressing
PC-3 cells showed enhanced tumor angiogenesis compared with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

the conditioned medium of PC-3 cells alone, suggesting that
tumor-derived PGE2 plays a crucial role in regulating tumor
angiogenesis (data not shown). The PGE2-induced angiogenesis
(vWF positivity) was analyzed and represented in the form of a
bar graph (Fig. 5B). These data showed that PGE2-induced EP2
and EP4 receptors mediated angiogenesis via NF-nB and Aktdependent pathway and further suggested that both EP2 and EP4
receptors might play important roles in regulating PGE2-induced
tumor angiogenesis.
Correlation between expression profiles of EP2 and EP4

in prostate tumor progression. Our in vitro and in vivo data
prompted us to examine the expression profiles of various
oncogenic and angiogenic molecules in human prostate cancer
specimens by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the
expression levels of ATF-4, c-Jun, c-Fos, uPA, and VEGF were higher
in malignant tumors compared with normal and PIN specimens,
which further correlated with the enhanced expressions of EP2 and
EP4 in human prostate cancer specimens (Fig. 6A). The expressions
of these molecules were quantified and represented in the form of a
bar graph (Fig. 6A).

Discussion
Prostate cancer is considered as one of the most lethal disease
for men in the United States and other parts of the world. To date,
treatments like androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy
are two of the major approaches known to increase survival of
patients with metastatic prostate cancer; however, some side
effects have been observed in patients undergoing these therapies
(2, 35). Therefore, identification of novel prognostic marker and
development of new therapeutic strategies could be the most
promising approaches in the next generation of prostate cancer
management.
Recently, several studies have shown the correlation between
overexpression of COX-2 with prostate tumorigenesis; however, the
molecular mechanism underlying COX-2–induced prostate cancer
progression and angiogenesis is still not well understood. Although
various reports have revealed the relationship between the elevated
levels of PGE2 with malignant cancers (3), the molecular
mechanism underlying PGE2-mediated prostate tumor progression
is still the subject of intense investigation. In this study, we have
shown the in-depth molecular mechanism underlying PGE2induced tumor cell motility and angiogenesis in prostate cancer
via EP2 and EP4 receptor–dependent pathway.
EGFR and MAPK-mediated activation of transcription factor AP1 has been reported as one of the crucial signaling cascade that
affects tumor cell motility in various cancers, including the
malignancies in prostate (36). Elevated expression of EGFR has
been observed in higher grades of prostate cancer, which further
correlate with poor clinical prognosis (37, 38). Earlier studies
reported that activation of EGFR in response to PGE2 leads to the
phosphorylation of ERK, which, in turn, regulates downstream
signaling events (36, 39). Moreover, it has also been observed that
PGE2 transactivates EGFR, which ultimately influences cell
migration, proliferation, and invasiveness in different cancer
models (36, 39, 40). In this paper, we have shown that PGE2
induces the activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling cascade in
prostate cancer cells. Recently, Wang and colleagues have shown
that among different PGE2 receptors, EP2 and EP4 predominantly
express PC-3 cells in androgen-independent prostate cancer (21).

PGE2-Dependent Tumor Progression and Angiogenesis

Here, we have shown that blocking of both PGE2 receptors (EP2
and EP4) by their specific antagonists curbs the PGE2-mediated
activation of EGFR and downstreams signaling cascades, which
ultimately suppress the prostate tumor cell motility.
Integrin h3 has been shown to play critical roles in several
distinct processes, such as tumor growth, metastasis, and
angiogenesis in various cancers, including prostate cancer
(41–43). Phosphorylation of h3 integrin is essential for the
activation of small GTP-binding proteins (Rho family), and
activation of Rho is necessary for invasion and migration in a
wide variety of cell types (44). Previous studies have indicated that
integrins control activation of AP-1 in prostate cancer cells (26).
Furthermore, earlier reports have shown that overexpression of h3
integrin correlates with enhanced metastatic phenotype in LNCaP
cells (42). Moreover, it has been observed that stromal cell derived
factor-1 transiently increased the expression and activation of h3
integrin in prostate cancer cells, which in turn augmented the
aggressiveness of prostate cancer (43). In this study, we have

reported that PGE2 induces the expression and phosphorylation of
h3 integrin in PC-3 cells. The EP2 and EP4 receptor antagonists
suppressed PGE2-induced expression and phosphorylation of h3
integrin, which further showed the involvement of both these
receptors in this process. Silencing of h3 integrin expression by its
specific siRNA suppresses PGE2-induced AP-1 activation, suggesting that PGE2 via EP2/EP4 controls AP-1 activation through h3
integrin–mediated pathway. Chen and colleagues have shown that
arachidonic acid regulates PGE2-mediated PKA-dependent expression of c-fos in PC-3 cells (5). In this study, we have shown the
molecular mechanism, at least in part, whereby PGE2 via EGFRERK or h3 integrin–mediated pathway augments the expression of
c-Fos and phosphorylation of c-Jun, which ultimately regulates
AP-1 activation in prostate cancer cells.
Previous data showed that ATF-4 forms heterodimers with either
c-Fos or c-Jun subunit of AP-1 and regulates the activation of AP-1
(45). In this study, we have shown that PGE2 augments ATF-4
activation, controls the interaction between ATF-4 and phosphor-

Figure 5. A, PGE2 regulates migration of endothelial cells toward the tumor cells. HUVEC, either alone or pretreated with EP2 or EP4 receptor antagonist, were used in
the upper chamber, whereas PC-3 cells, either alone or transfected with wt COX-2 cDNA or COX-2 siRNA, were used in the lower chamber. In separate experiments,
PGE2 was used in the lower chamber as positive control. The endothelial cells migrated toward the reverse side of the upper chamber were stained with Giemsa,
photographed, counted in 3 hpf, and represented in the form of a bar graph (*, P < 0.004; **, P < 0.015). B, PGE2 regulates EP2/EP4 receptor–dependent angiogenesis
in Matrigel plug assay. PGE2 alone or along with AH6809 or AH23848 was mixed with Matrigel and injected s.c. in male athymic nude mice (NMRI, nu/nu). After 21 d,
mice were sacrificed and Matrigel plugs were photographed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-CD31, anti-vWF, anti–phosphorylated p65, and
anti–phosphorylated Akt antibodies. CD31 was stained with Cy2-conjugated IgG (green ), whereas vWF, phosphorylated p65, and phosphorylated Akt were stained with
Cy3-conjugated IgG (red). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue ). The vWF-positive staining was quantified by Image Pro Plus 6.0 Software and represented graphically.

Figure 6. Expression profiles of EP2, EP4, ATF-4, c-Jun, c-Fos, uPA, and VEGF in human prostate cancer specimens and their correlation with human prostate cancer
progression in different pathologic grades. A, the levels of EP2, EP4, ATF-4, c-Jun, c-Fos, uPA, and VEGF were detected by immunohistochemical studies using their
specific antibodies. EP2, EP4, ATF-4, c-Jun, c-Fos, and uPA were stained with Cy3-conjugated IgG (red ). VEGF was stained with Cy2-conjugated IgG (green ).
Sections stained with anti-rabbit IgG were used as control. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue ). The expression profiles were quantified by Image Pro Plus 6.0

ylated c-Jun, and regulates ATF-4–dependent AP-1 activation in
prostate cancer cells.
uPA and its receptor uPAR-mediated signaling has been
implicated in tumor cell invasion, survival, and metastasis in a
variety of cancers including prostate (20). Both uPA and uPAR are
expressed at higher levels in malignant prostate tissues than in
benign and normal prostate tissues (20). VEGF acts as one of the
key proangiogenic factor responsible for neovascularization in
cancer cells (46). Previous studies have indicated that inhibition of
VEGF expression is a critical step in arresting prostate tumor
growth and progression (47, 48). In this study, we have shown
in-depth molecular mechanism underlying PGE2-induced EP2/EP4mediated expression of uPA and VEGF via activation of AP-1 and
ATF-4, which eventually affects tumor cell motility and angiogenesis. Moreover, our data revealed that inhibition of tumor-derived
PGE2 by COX-2 siRNA suppressed uPA and VEGF expression,
suggesting that PGE2, both tumor-derived and exogenous, regulates
this process in prostate cancer cells.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

Angiogenesis is one of the most crucial steps in the
development of tumor. The proliferation and migration of
endothelial cells play crucial roles in the regulation of tumorassociated angiogenesis (49). We have shown that PGE2 induces
the phosphorylation of Akt and NF-nB, p65 in endothelial
cells. Moreover, both exogenous and tumor-derived PGE2 augments endothelial cell motility, and blocking of endothelial EP2
and EP4 receptors by their antagonists suppresses endothelial
cell motility toward tumor cells. In vivo Matrigel plug
angiogenesis assay showed that PGE2 induces angiogenesis
whereas blocking EP2 and EP4 receptors suppressed this effect,
indicating that PGE2 augments EP2/EP4-mediated in vivo
angiogenesis. Our data also revealed that tumor-derived PGE2
induces tumor angiogenesis. Taken together, these results showed
that PGE2 via EP2/EP4 receptor promotes in vivo angiogenesis
through activation of Akt and NF-nB, suggesting that PGE2 plays
an important role in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis.
Furthermore, prostate tumor clinical specimen analysis data also

corroborated with in vitro and in vivo findings, indicating higher
levels of uPA and VEGF expression in malignant prostate tumors
compared with normal and PIN tissues, which further correlated
with the enhanced expression levels of ATF-4, c-Fos, c-Jun, EP2,
and EP4. These data provide, at least in part, the molecular basis
by which PGE2 controls downstream signaling cascades and
leads to the expression of various oncogenic and angiogenic
molecules that ultimately regulate the prostate cancer progression and angiogenesis (Fig. 6B). Thus, targeting PGE2 by
interfering its interaction with EP2 and EP4 receptors might be
an alternative therapeutics that may aid in the rational design of
therapeutic strategy for the next generation of prostate cancer
treatment.
