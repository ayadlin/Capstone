ABSTRACT
The Hippo signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, apoptosis,
differentiation, and development. Major effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway
include the transcriptional co-activators Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and WW
domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (TAZ). The transcriptional
activities of YAP and TAZ are affected by interactions with proteins from many diverse
signaling pathways as well as responses to the external environment. High YAP and
TAZ activity has been observed in many cancer types, and functional dysregulation
of Hippo signaling enhances the oncogenic properties of YAP and TAZ and promotes
cancer development. Many biological elements, including mechanical strain on the
cell, cell polarity/adhesion molecules, other signaling pathways (e.g., G-proteincoupled receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, Wnt, Notch, and transforming
growth factor β/bone morphogenic protein), and cellular metabolic status, can
promote oncogenesis through synergistic association with components of the Hippo
signaling pathway. Here, we review the signaling networks that interact with the
Hippo signaling pathway and discuss the potential of using drugs that inhibit YAP and
TAZ activity for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HIPPO
SIGNALING PATHWAY

The Hippo signaling pathway plays a crucial
role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and
development. The phosphorylation cascades of Hippo
core components (Hpo, Sav, Wts, and Mats in Drosophila
and Mst1/2, Sav1, Lats1/2, and Mob1a/b in mammals)
inhibit the activation of transcriptional co-activators
Yorkie (Yki), YAP, and TAZ (Figure 1A). YAP and TAZ
are major effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. They
function as transcription factors along with TEAD (TEA
domain family member) in the nucleus, which increases
expression of such target genes as Ctgf, Cyr61, AXL, and
Survivin (Figure 1B). The phosphorylation of YAP and
TAZ and activation of Lats kinase are regulated by multiple
mechanisms. Many biological pathways and factors have
been shown to affect the activity of the Hippo signaling
pathway beyond the simple phosphorylation of YAP and
TAZ by core components. We review the history and current
understanding of the function and regulation of the Hippo
signaling pathway and discuss some unresolved issues.

Two decades ago, loss of the Warts (Wts) gene
in Drosophila was shown to cause dramatic cell
overproliferation and various developmental defects [1, 2].
Following this report, some groups showed that defects of
the Salvador (Sav) [3, 4], Hippo (Hpo) [5–9], and Mats
[10] genes resulted in an increase in tissue growth and
impairment of apoptosis. All of these signaling molecules
are directly involved in the Hippo signaling pathway,
which depends on a phosphorylation cascade (Figure 1A).
Yki was identified as a transcriptional co-activator and
downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway in
Drosophila [11]. Subsequent studies identified mammalian
orthologs of pathway components and confirmed that this
pathway is well conserved in mammals.
Because Yki, YAP, and TAZ cannot bind to DNA,
they need to bind to another transcription factor that
interacts with DNA directly. In Drosophila, Scalloped
(Sd) binding to Yki increases the transcriptional activity of

Sd [12]. Sd belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved
proteins that are characterized by the presence of a TEA/
ATTS (Transcriptional Enhancer Activator/AbaA, TEC1 p,
TEF-1 Sequence) DNA-binding domain. The mammalian
orthologs of Sd, TEAD family transcription factors
(TEAD1-4), are key YAP interaction partners (Figure 1B).
TEAD or Sd bind specifically to a consensus motif (GTIIC
and Sph sequence, TGGAATGT or ACATTCCA) and
activate transcription in vivo [13]. While expression of
TEAD or YAP causes marked cell-cycle progression and
inhibits differentiation in neural progenitor cells, their loss
of function results in an increase in apoptosis [12, 14, 15].
TEAD-binding-deficient YAP (S94A mutant) mimics YAP
knockout phenotypes in the skin and heart [16, 17].
In mammals, the five consensus HXRXXS
motifs in YAP (S61, S109, S127, S164, and S381) are
phosphorylated by Lats kinase. Although all of these are
phosphorylated in vivo, S127 and S381 are regarded as
the critical sites related to increased oncogenic activity.
S127 phosphorylation results in 14-3-3 binding and
cytoplasmic sequestration. S381 phosphorylation induces
the subsequent phosphorylation of S384 and S387 by
CK1δ/ε. These phosphorylated phosphodegrons recruit
the SCFbeta-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, which ultimately leads
to YAP degradation [18].

demonstrated, several proteins have recently been found
to regulate Hippo core components in less direct fashion,
bypassing the linear kinase modules to activate YAP and
TAZ. These studies have shown that mechanical cues, cell
polarity/adhesion molecules, other signaling pathways,
and cellular metabolic status can regulate YAP and TAZ
activity.

Cytoskeleton modulators
The growth of normal cells in culture systems
halts when they physically encounter other cells.
YAP is inhibited by cell-cell contact (i.e., a high cell
density) through Hippo signaling pathway activation,
and overexpression of YAP can overcome cell-contact
inhibition and promote cell proliferation [19].
The rigidity and cell geometry of the extracellular
matrix (ECM) regulate YAP and TAZ activity (Figure 2A).
While cells cultured on rigid hydrogels exhibit high YAP
and TAZ activity with a broader cell-ECM contact area,
culture on soft matrices inhibits YAP and TAZ activity
resulting in a smaller cell-ECM contact area [20].
These results suggest that YAP and TAZ sense external
mechanical cues and regulate cell proliferation based
on proper cellular microenvironments. Cell attachment
or detachment to the ECM leads to dramatic actin and
microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization and YAP
dephosphorylation or phosphorylation, respectively. The
actin cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs latrunculin B and
cytochalasin D inhibit YAP activation in response to cell
attachment to the ECM (Figure 2A). Disruption of the

of YAP and TAZ by Hippo core components has been

Figure 1: Regulation of YAP activity by Hippo core components. A. The phosphorylation cascades of Hippo core components

reduce the activation of the transcriptional co-activator YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 and recruits
SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, which ultimately leads to YAP degradation. B. Impaired or attenuated activity of Hippo core components
results in the dephosphorylation of YAP and translocation of YAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In the nucleus, YAP cannot bind to
DNA directly and TEAD family transcription factors, which are characterized by the presence of a TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain, are
key partners of YAP for DNA binding and transcriptional activation.

Figure 2: Bi-directional interactions between Hippo and other signaling pathways. A. Modulation of the actin cytoskeleton

affects YAP activity. Extracellular matrix stiffness, cell geometry, cell-cell contacts, and F-actin-modulated proteins regulate YAP and TAZ
activity. Rho family small GTPases play a key role in actin cytoskeleton organization. LPA- and S1P-activated Gα12/13-protein-coupled
receptors inhibit Lats1/2 kinase activity, whereas glucagon- and epinephrine-activated Gαs-protein-coupled receptors stimulate Lats1/2
kinase activity. Gαq/11 protein can either activate or inhibit YAP activity. B. In mammals, apical domain protein NF2 and Kibra act as
upstream regulators of Hippo core components. To activate the Hippo signaling pathway, NF2 and Kibra may require Tao-1 kinase activity.

with Mst and Lats kinase through Sav, and these complexes induce YAP-S127 phosphorylation. Epidermal growth factor-mediated
PI3K activation triggers the dissociation of PDK1 and Hippo core components that fail to promote YAP phosphorylation. Nuclear YAP
and TAZ promote SHP2-dependent dephosphorylation of parafibromin. The phosphorylated parafibromin interacts with β-catenin and
activates Wnt target gene transcription. However, cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ inhibit the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin as integral
components of the Wnt signaling pathway. TAZ, YAP, SMAD2/3, and TEAD physically interact in the nucleus and share a transcriptional
program. D. Glucose deprivation leads to AMOTL1 phosphorylation by AMPK. Phosphorylated AMOTL1 is more stabilized and promotes
YAP-S127 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. AMPK also inhibits the transcriptional activity of YAP through direct phosphorylation.
The mevalonate pathway can promote Rho GTPase activity through geranylgeranylation, thus enhancing YAP and TAZ activity. Under
hypoxic conditions, a positive feedback loop may be established to enhance HIF1, YAP, and TAZ activity.

actin cytoskeleton induces Lats kinase activity through
activation of protein kinase A (PKA) [21]. In Drosophila,
extra F-actin formation through the loss of capping
proteins led to overgrowth in imaginal discs through
the inhibition of Hippo signaling activity [22, 23]. In
mammals, depletion of the actin-destabilizing proteins
Cofilin, CapZ, and Gelsolin increases F-actin stability and
YAP/TAZ activity, even at high cell density [24].
Rho family small guanosine triphosphatases
(GTPases) play a key role in actin cytoskeleton
organization (Figure 2A). The specific Rho GTPase
inhibitor botulinum toxin C3 blocked YAP activation in
response to cell attachment. Moreover, the G-proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) ligands lysophosphatidic acid
and sphingosine 1-phosphophate inhibited Lats1/2 kinase
through Gα12/13-protein-coupled receptors. In contrast,
glucagon and epinephrine, which stimulate Gαs-proteincoupled receptors, activated Lats1/2 [25, 26]. Depletion
of Rho GTPase activator AKAP13 attenuates YAP and
TAZ activity by inhibiting organization of the actin
cytoskeleton, which occurs independently of Lats activity
in human embryonic stem cells [27].
Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein found on the
intracellular side of the plasma membrane and involved in
cytoskeletal tension. Spectrin acts as a tumor suppressor
and upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway
in Drosophila. Spectrin downregulation led to the
phosphorylation of regulatory light chain of myosin II by
Rho-associated protein kinase, resulting in the generation
of contractile tension and Yki activation [28, 29].
Mechanical force appears to change cytoskeletal
organization in a context-dependent manner and to
modulate YAP activity. In Drosophila, Ajuba LIM protein
binds to α-catenin and Wts at adherens junctions under
conditions of high cytoskeletal tension and then inhibits
Wts activity [30]. Mechanical stimuli can also activate
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to a JNKdependent increase in LIMD1, which then binds and
inhibits Lats1 kinase [31].

Another report showed that Mer and neurofibromatosis
type II (NF2; mammalian ortholog) anchor Wts and Lats
to the plasma membrane, in turn promoting Wts and Lats
phosphorylation by Hpo and Mst in an actin-mediated
manner [41]. The immunoglobulin domain-containing
cell adhesion molecule Echinoid (Ed) interacts with and
stabilizes Sav at adherens junctions to activate Hpo [42].
Loss of Ed results in tissue overgrowth via high Yki
activity in Drosophila.
In mammals, angiomotin (AMOT) family proteins
inhibit YAP and TAZ activity via direct binding at tight
junctions independently of YAP and TAZ phosphorylation
status [43–45] (Figure 2B). α-Catenin is involved in
tumor suppression and cell density sensing. This protein
negatively regulates YAP by forming a complex with 143-3 and inhibiting the access of PP2A phosphatase for
YAP dephosphorylation at adherens junctions [16]. Nonreceptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase 14 (PTPN14) is
located at adherens junctions and binds to YAP. Under high
cell density conditions, YAP is sequestered and inhibited
by PTPN14 in the cytoplasm [46–48]. Scribble is localized
at the basolateral domain of the cell membrane and where
it suppresses tumorigenesis by forming a complex with
Mst1/2, Lats1/2, and TAZ and thus inhibiting TAZ
activity [49]. Scribble also acts downstream of the tumor
suppressor LKB1 and microtubule affinity-regulating
kinase (MARK) to activate the Hippo signaling pathway
[50].
Although several lines of evidence indicate that the
modulation of cell polarity/adhesion molecules influences
Hippo core components and YAP and TAZ activity, their
relationship may be mostly indirect. Additional studies are
required to define the link between cell polarity/adhesion
molecules and the Hippo signaling pathway.

Other signaling pathways that interact with the
Hippo signaling pathway
The Hippo signaling pathway is integrated
upstream or downstream of other biological processes.
The prominent signaling pathways related to the Hippo
signaling pathway are GPCR, epidermal growth factor
(EGF), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming
growth factor β (TGFβ), Wnt, and Notch signaling
pathways (Figure 2A and 2C).
GPCR signaling has been implicated in almost every
aspect of the physiological regulation of Hippo signaling
(Figure 2A). As mentioned above, the activation of Gα12/13
stimulates YAP and TAZ activity by inhibiting Lats1/2
kinase [26, 51], and the activation of Gαs activates Lats1/2
kinase activity [26]. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP), a second messenger of Gαs, activates protein
kinase A (PKA). Activated PKA activates Lats kinase by
inhibition of Rho GTPases [21, 52]. Gαq/11 can activate
protein kinase C (PKC), which can either activate or inhibit
YAP activity, dependent on the isoforms of PKC [53].

Cell polarity/adhesion molecules
In Drosophila, Merlin (Mer), Expanded (Ex),
Kibra, and Crumbs interact with the cytoskeleton at the
apical domain of the cell. The FERM domain proteins
Mer and Ex control proliferation and apoptosis through
Hippo signaling activity [32]. The WW domain protein
Kibra forms a complex with Mer and Ex and acts
upstream of the Hippo core components to activate Hippo
signaling in Drosophila [33–35] (Figure 2B). The apical
transmembrane protein Crumbs is important for apicalbasal polarity and binds with Ex to induce proper Hippo
signaling activity [36–38]. The connection between Mer/
Ex/Kibra and the Hippo signaling pathway may be needed
for Tao-1 kinase activity. Tao-1 phosphorylates Hpo at
Thr195 in Drosophila and Mst in mammals [39, 40].

Treatment with an EGF ligand induces PI3-kinase
(PI3K)–phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1)
axis activation and inhibits Hippo core components
independently of AKT (Figure 2C). In confluent or serumstarved cells, PDK1 binds to Mst and Lats kinase through
Sav, inducing YAP S127 phosphorylation. Epidermal
growth factor-mediated PI3K activation triggers the
dissociation of PDK1 and Hippo core components that fail
to promote YAP phosphorylation [54]. EGFR signaling
also promotes Ajuba phosphorylation through the Ras–
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Phosphorylated
Ajuba binds to Lats and Sav and inhibits Hippo core
component activity [55]. PI3K activation promotes TAZ
stabilization, which is dependent on AKT [56]. The EGFR
ligands amphiregulin (AREG) [57] and epiregulin (EREG)
[58] may be transcriptional or downstream targets of YAP
and TAZ. These findings suggest a positive feedback
loop and intimate crosstalk between the EGF and Hippo
signaling pathways.
TGFβ and BMP signaling acts as a ligand-induced
transcriptional activator or repressor of responsive
target genes that act through the SMAD (Sma and Madrelated family) protein complex [59] (Figure 2C). TGFβ
stimulates TAZ to bind heteromeric Smad2/3-4 complexes,
and the loss of TAZ results in a failure of Smad2/3-4
complexes to accumulate in the nucleus [60]. TAZ, YAP,
TGFβ-activated Smad2/3, and TEAD physically bind to
each other in the nucleus, and a genome-wide analysis
revealed that they share a pro-tumorigenic transcriptional
program [61]. YAP, TAZ, TEAD, Smad2/3, and Oct4
complexes suppress the transcription of a mesendodermal
marker that inhibits differentiation in human embryonic
stem cells [62]. YAP and TAZ activate TGFβ and Smad
signaling in Mob1-deficient mouse liver, and these
mice develop liver cancer, combined hepatocellular and
cholangiocarcinomas, and intrahepatic cholangiocellular
carcinomas [63]. Activated YAP/TAZ-TEAD bind the
Tgfβ2 locus and increase transcription levels of Tgfβ2 in
Lats1/2-deficient hepatoblasts and embryonic liver. Loss
of Lats kinase activity promotes a lineage specification
from hepatoblast to biliary epithelial cell but not to
hepatocyte differentiation [64]. YAP also supports BMP–
Smad1/5/8-dependent transcription. Receptor-activated
Smad1 is phosphorylated by CDK8/9, which promotes
Smad transcription action through the recruitment of
YAP to the phosphorylated linker sites [65]. BMP4, a
TGFβ superfamily growth factor, is a TAZ-dependent
transcriptional target that promotes Smad1/5/8-mediated
signaling in mammary epithelial cells [66].
Hippo and Wnt signaling reciprocally regulate each
other’s activity through a variety of mechanisms (Figure
2C). First, nuclear YAP and TAZ promote the nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin, which in turn activates Wnt
signaling. SHP2, a ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine
phosphatase, physically binds to YAP and TAZ. YAP and
TAZ stimulate the nuclear translocation of SHP2, which in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

turn dephosphorylates parafibromin. The dephosphorylated
parafibromin–β-catenin complex activates Wnt target gene
transcription [67]. Second, cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ that
are displaced from the nucleus by phosphorylation events
are integral components of the Wnt destruction complex
(Axin, GSK3, and β-TrCP) and promote the proteasomal
degradation of β-catenin in the absence of Wnt activation
[68–70]. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is known as a
negative regulator of β-catenin and important as a scaffold
protein that activates Lats and Sav1. GSK3β and Axin2
are needed to facilitate Hippo signaling [71]. Cytoplasmic
YAP and TAZ interact with Disheveled (DVL) and block
DVL-dependent Wnt transcriptional activity [72]. Third,
alternative Rho GTPase-dependent Wnt signaling can
activate YAP and TAZ activity by inhibiting Lats kinase
activity. Among the target genes of YAP and TAZ are
secreted canonical Wnt inhibitor genes that inhibit the
expression of β-catenin/TCF target genes [73]. Crosstalk
between the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways in
intestinal tissue is clear, but more studies may be needed
to verify whether the correlation between them is positive
or negative and whether such a correlation exists in other
organs or tissues beyond the intestine.
YAP/TEAD complex directly regulates the
transcription of Jag1 [74] and Notch2 [75, 76]. Other
Notch components and Notch target genes are elevated
by YAP activation in mouse liver [76]. During ductal
reactions and biliary regeneration in liver, the activation
of Jag1-Notch2-mediated Notch signaling is important for
the differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells into biliaryspecific cells [77, 78]. YAP also promotes proliferation but
prevents differentiation in satellite cells (myogenic stem
cells in skeletal muscle) via Notch [79, 80]. However,
Mob1-deficient mice exhibit elevated Jagged1 but not
Notch2 or Hes1 despite YAP activation [63]. It is still
unclear whether YAP transcriptional activity directly leads
to Notch signaling activation in diverse situations.

Cellular metabolic status affects Hippo signaling
In response to energy deprivation, cell growth
and proliferation are inhibited, and YAP and TAZ
activity decreases (Figure 2D). Energy stress induced by
2-deoxy-D-glucose, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
ribonucleotide and Metformin activates AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK), which directly phosphorylates
angiomotin-like 1 (AMOTL1). Phosphorylated AMOTL1
promotes YAP-S127 phosphorylation and nuclear
exclusion in a Lats kinase-dependent manner [81]. AMPK
also inhibits the transcriptional activity of YAP-TEAD
by directly phosphorylating YAP S61 [82] and the TEAD
binding motif YAP S94 [83]. High YAP transcriptional
activity enhances glucose-transporter 3 (GLUT3)
transcription, promoting glycolysis, and YAP and GLUT3
expression is positively correlated in human cancers [82].
A sufficient glucose supply can activate YAP and TAZ

activity and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), a glycolytic
enzyme, mediates glucose-induced YAP- and TAZ-TEAD
interactions [84].
Under hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor
1 (HIF1) is rapidly accumulated, and the transcriptional
activity of HIF1 is elevated in response to changes
in available oxygen in the cellular environment. The
hypoxia-induced HIF1 transcriptional target genes include
TAZ and ubiquitin ligase SIAH1/2, which is required for
the ubiquitination and degradation of Lats2 kinase [85,
86] (Figure 2D). YAP also binds to and stabilizes HIF1
[86], and a positive feedback loop may be established
to enhance HIF1 and YAP/TAZ activity under hypoxic
conditions.
The mevalonate pathway produces numerous
essential metabolic biomolecules, such as cholesterol,
steroid hormones, and vitamin K from acetyl-coenzyme
A (CoA) [87]. An inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxyl3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase converts
HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, causing marked
cytoplasmic accumulation of YAP and TAZ (Figure
2D). Mevalonic acid is a precursor of geranylgeranyl
pyrophosphate, which promotes Gβγ protein and Rho
GTPase activity though geranylgeranylation, enhancing
YAP and TAZ activity [88, 89]. Mevalonate-mediated
YAP and TAZ activation increases the expression of the
receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM),
contributing to the tumorigenesis and metastasis of many
tumors [90].

cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct hamartoma [97–99].
Hepatocyte- and intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion
of Sav1 leads to increase of hepatic progenitor cells and
intestinal progenitor cells, respectively [100, 101]. Various
types of tumor arise in hypomorphic Mob1 mouse [102],
and phenotypes of liver-specific Mob1-deficient mice are
similar to Lats1/2-knockout liver [63]. Because, in many
cases, dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway and
increased YAP/TAZ activity induce expansion of tissuespecific stem/progenitor cells which eventually leads to
development of cancer, uncovering the physiological roles
of the Hippo signaling pathway and YAP/TAZ in a tissue
homeostasis and cancer stem cells would be helpful for
cancer therapy.
The correlation between Hippo signaling and
cancer is not the same in all tissues or cells. For example,
the epidermis of mice with skin-specific deletion of
Mst1/2 or Lats1/2 shows no abnormality and YAP-S127
phosphorylation is not increased [16]. Also, no kidney
defects or YAP activation are seen after deletion of
Mst1/2 or Sav1 [103]. Thus, YAP activity is not always
elevated by restriction of Hippo core components.
Meanwhile, there is a case in which oncogenic phenotype
does not occur in spite of the activation of YAP. Intestinal
epithelial cell-specific YAP transgenic expression leads
to rapid loss of intestinal crypts and inhibition of Wntmediated intestinal regeneration [72]. These results
suggest that the Hippo signaling pathway and YAP/TAZ
have different tissue- or cell-type-specific physiological
roles.
Although the dysregulation of YAP has been
reported in many types of cancer, little is known about
the contributions of mutations of Hippo signaling
pathway genes. Data from the Catalogue of Somatic
Mutation in Cancer (COSMIC) census show that Hippo
pathway genes, with the exception of NF2 and TAZ,
are not cancer-related genes [104]. Although recent
studies have reported that some mutations of YAP,
Lats1/2, GPCRs, NF2, and TAZ are related to the
development of cancer [105], it is still unclear why
the mutations in Hippo signaling pathway genes are so
rare, when considering that YAP and TAZ activation
is so frequently observed in a broad range of human
cancers. One possibility is that YAP and TAZ activation
is affected by other signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt
[106], TGFβ-BMP [107], Notch [108], EGFR [109],
and GPCR [110]) that frequently harbor oncogenic
mutations. The activation of these other signaling
pathways is correlated with the immunohistochemical
detection of nuclear YAP and TAZ in tumor tissues [63,
74, 111–113]. In addition, mutations of Hippo signaling
pathway genes and crosstalk with other aberrant
signaling pathways may result in the development of
cancer. Further investigation is required to define the
major oncogenic sources that cause YAP and TAZ
activation in various tumor types.

Hippo signaling and cancer
Elevated YAP and TAZ activity induce hyperplasia,
dysplasia, and tumors in a number of mouse models. YAPinducible transgenic mice show irregular expansion in
liver tissue and undifferentiated intestinal progenitor cells
[91]. YAP induces transcription of cell-cycle regulator
Cyclin E and IAP / BCL2 family proteins in Drosophila,
and Cyclin D and BclXL expression levels are correlated
with YAP expression levels in human colorectal cancers
[91, 92]. YAP also assures cells ongoing proliferation after
radiation. Radiation resistance conferred by YAP induces
genomic instability and complicates radiation therapy for
cancer patients [93]. Thus, YAP activation confers potent
cell proliferation capacity and resistance to apoptosis
which can eventually lead to cancer development. In
addition, TAZ stimulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition through transcriptional activation of ZEB1/2
[94, 95].
Deletion of Hippo core component genes can also
cause hyperplasia or expansion of specific cell types.
In the liver-specific Lats1/2-knockout mouse, liver is
filled with highly proliferated immature biliary epithelial
cells [64]. Deletion of Sav1, Mst1/2, or Lats2 promotes
cardiomyocyte proliferation at the embryonic stage
[96]. Mst1/2 deletion causes hepatocellular carcinoma,

to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in a Kras (G12D) cancer
model [122]. The function of transcriptional co-activator
YAP/TAZ are primarily mediated by other transcription
factors, such as TEADs, SMADs, and RUNX. Thus,
disrupting the interaction with its partner transcription factor
could inhibit YAP/TAZ’s oncogenic activity. The structural
information of YAP-TEAD complex is well established [123–
125]. YAP has an N-terminal TEAD-binding domain, and
point mutations of M89A, R89A, L91A, S94A, F95A and
F96A of the twisted-coil region of YAP strongly diminished
YAP-TEAD activity in vitro [123]. Lentiviral expression of
YAP fragment 86-100, which weakly interacts with TEAD,
has no significant effect on the YAP-TEAD activity [123].
The TDU domains of VGLL4, a natural antagonist of YAP,
compete with YAP for TEAD4 binding. Inhibitor peptide
derived from the TDU domain potently suppresses tumor
growth in vitro and in vivo [126]. Further investigation will
be needed to design YAP inhibitors based on the YAP-TEAD
structure to selectively inhibit YAP-induced tumorigenesis.
In high-throughput screening, Verteporfin, a small
molecule that belongs to the porphyrin family, was
identified as an inhibitor of YAP-TEAD interactions
(Table 1). Treatment with Verteporfin inhibited YAPinduced liver overgrowth in NF2/Merlin inactivation
[127]. Many researchers have discovered numerous small
molecules that can regulate Hippo and YAP upstream
components through the GPCR, Rho, cAMP, F-actin,
EGFR, and mevalonate pathways (Table 1). These small
molecules inhibit the transcriptional activation by YAP
and TAZ in mice and cultured cancer cell systems and may
be applicable as anti-cancer drug candidates.

As discussed above, the Hippo signaling pathway
is interconnected with other biological processes that
promote tumor formation and development. YAP and
TAZ activity is high in many cancer types, which
suggests that Hippo signaling components are potential
targets for cancer therapy. The Hippo core kinases
Mst1/2 and Lats1/2 are the most attractive therapeutic
targets. However, Mst1/2 and Lats1/2 kinases are tumor
suppressive, and their activity is low in many cancer types,
unlike most oncogenic kinases, such as Src, Abl, Raf, and
Akt, which are activated by mutations and involved in
tumorigenesis [114]. Therefore, agonists that can enhance
the Hippo core kinase activity are required for developing
anti-cancer drugs.
Recently, YAP was identified as a key survival
input that mediates resistance by acting parallel to other
known pathways in cancer progression. YAP silencing
enhanced the response to RAF and MEK inhibitor in a
wide spectrum of BRAF-mutated cancer cell lines, and
patients who have BRAF-mutated tumors with lower YAP
expression respond better to treatment with RAF and MEK
inhibitor [115, 116]. Increased actin cytoskeleton tension
is accompanied by activation of YAP/TAZ in BRAFmutated melanoma which acquires resistance to RAF
and MEK inhibitor. Suppression of actin cytoskeleton
assembly and tension inhibits both YAP/TAZ activation
and BRAF inhibitor resistance [117]. In addition, colon
cancer cell lines with elevated YAP activity are resistant to
5-fluorouracil[118], and breast cancer cell lines expressing
activated TAZ are more resistant to doxorubicin/paclitaxel
[49] and taxol treatment [119]. However, the mechanism
by which chemotherapy elevates YAP/TAZ activity is not
clear, and further investigation is needed to address how
activated YAP/TAZ confers chemotherapy resistance to
cells as well as to clarify the oncogenic properties of YAP/
TAZ.
The direct inhibition of YAP and TAZ oncoproteins
is also a therapeutic target for anti-cancer treatment.
Heterozygous and homozygous deletion of YAP dramatically
suppresses tumorigenesis in LKB1-, Mob1-, and NF2deficient liver [50, 63, 120], Mst1/2-deficient phenotypes in
the small intestine and colon [121], and the early progression

DISCUSSION
Hippo core components and YAP and TAZ activity
are regulated by a variety of mechanisms. A number of
studies have reported that the Hippo signaling pathway is
associated with cellular mechanical strain, cell polarity/
adhesion molecules, other signaling pathways (e.g., GPCR,
EGFR, Wnt, Notch, and TGFβ/BMP), and cellular metabolic
status. Dysregulation of Hippo signaling generally results in
aberrant YAP and TAZ transcriptional activity that enhances
their oncogenic properties. High YAP and TAZ activity has
been detected in many types of cancer, but genetic mutations
of Hippo core components, YAP, or TAZ are rarely found.

This implies that aberrant activation of the Hippo signaling
pathway may be insufficient for cancer formation in vivo.
Activation of YAP and TAZ may be triggered by other
biological processes that are vulnerable to oncogenic
mutations and increases in the transcription of genes that
are related to oncogenic processes. Understanding the
synergistic effects between the Hippo signaling pathway and
other biological processes that result in tumorigenesis could
facilitate the development of new anti-cancer drugs.
