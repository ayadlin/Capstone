Abstract
Nicotine, one of the major components in tobacco, is at high
concentrations in the bloodstream of cigarette smokers.
However, the mechanisms of how nicotine affects tumor
development and whether nicotine is a potential carcinogen
for malignancies induced by secondhand smoking are not fully
understood yet. Here, we investigate the signaling pathways by
which nicotine potentiates tumorigenesis in human mammary
epithelial-like MCF10A or cancerous MCF7 cells. We show that
human MCF10A and MCF7 cells both express four subunits of
nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The treatment of
these cells with nicotine enhances the activity of protein
kinase C (PKC) A without altering the expression level of this
kinase. Nicotine also stimulates [3H]thymidine incorporation
into the genome of these cells as well as forces serum-starved
cells to enter S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in growth
promotion. Importantly, on nicotine treatment, the mobility
of MCF10A and MCF7 cells is enhanced, which can be blocked
by the addition of nAChR or PKC inhibitor. Experiments using
small interfering RNA knockdown or ectopic expression of
cdc42 showed that cdc42 functions as a downstream effector
of PKC and is crucial in the regulation of nicotine-mediated
migratory activity in the cells. Together, our findings suggest
that nicotine, through interacting with its receptor, initiates a
signaling cascade that involves PKC and cdc42 and consequently promotes migration in mammary epithelial or tumor
cells. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8473–81]

Introduction
Tobacco contains various components, of which many are
carcinogenic and/or mutagenic (1, 2). Although studies have linked
cigarette smoking with various onsets of human malignancies, little
is known about how secondhand smoking promotes tumor
development or causes the onset of cancer. Nicotine has been
identified as one of the important constituents of tobacco (3).
Through interacting with nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR),
nicotine functions either on the motor end plate of muscle or at the
central nervous system responsible for tobacco addiction (4–6).
Recently, it has been recognized that nicotine is able to activate
various intracellular signaling pathways in nonneuronal cells,
indicating that nicotine may possess a function for tumor
promotion (7–11). After engaging its receptor, nicotine rapidly

activates mitogenic-related, intracellular signaling pathways in
endothelial cells or keratinocytes (11, 12). Emerging evidence
showed that nicotine potently induces secretion of different types
of calpain from lung cancer cells, which then promotes cleavage of
various substrates in the extracellular matrix to facilitate
metastasis and tumor progression (10).
nAChR is composed of nine a subunits (a2–a10) and two h
subunits (h2 and h4; refs. 13, 14). The receptor is expressed on the
surface of various nonneuronal cells, such as lung epithelial cells,
keratinocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (7–14). On the
surface of these cells, the a3, a5, a7, a9, h2, and h4 subunits are
expressed. Among the subunits, a3, a5, h2, and h4 form
heteromeric channels in different combinations (11, 15–18). The
homomeric channel often is composed by several a7 or a9
subunits. These heteromeric or homomeric channels are highly
Ca2+ permeable, which allow releases of Ca2+ from intracellular
stores to the cytosol of cells (19, 20). In human epidermal cells, the
interaction of nicotine and its receptor has been shown to activate
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase C (PKC),
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and Rac/cdc42 that are
often involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and
invasion (11, 21, 22). The activation of nicotine receptor is able to
activate Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase/ERK signaling (11). Recently,
it has also been reported recently that on the ligation of nAChR by
nicotine, the tyrosine kinase Janus-activated kinase-2 and transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT) 3 in macrophages are activated (22).
PKC consists of more than 12 different isoforms of proteinserine/threonine kinases that are important components of
phospholipase-coupled growth factor receptor signaling pathways
(23–26). The enzymatic activities of PKC isoforms are regulated
by diacylglycerol (DAG) or Ca2+, which divides these kinases into
three subclasses: DAG-dependent (PKCy, PKCq, PKCu, and
PKCA), DAG/Ca2+-dependent (PKCa, PKChI, and PKChII), and
atypical (PKC~, PKCE, and PKCH ) isoforms. These isoforms have
different tissue distributions and are involved in different
biological processes, including cell growth, migration, apoptosis,
and differentiation (23–26). In the bloodstream of smokers,
nicotine is found to be at pharmacologic concentrations of 90 to
1,000 nmol/L, which is able to activate PKC in cultured human
or murine lung cancer cells (7, 27). The activation of PKC is
responsible for Bcl-2 phosphorylation, which, in turn, antagonizes drug-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells (27). It has
been reported that nicotine can elicit the activity of Ras or Raf-1
(9, 11, 28). In addition, studies have shown that Akt was
phosphorylated in the lungs of nicotine-treated mice and in
human lung cancer tissues derived from smokers (29). All these
observations suggest that nicotine is able to promote prosurvival
activity in cells and is important for tumorigenesis.

Cancer Research

Cell migration or tumor metastasis is a crucial process in tumor
development. Numerous factors play a role in the regulation of this
process, which includes growth factors, kinases, phosphatases, as
well as extracellular matrix components. Growth-related receptors,
when activated by corresponding ligands, contribute to cell
proliferation and migratory or invasive capacity of cells. After
recruiting downstream effectors, growth-related receptors often
exert their functions by organizing their downstream effectors,
such as PKC, PI3K, or cdc42, to initiate signaling cascades, which
affect various biological processes, including cell migration and
cancer cell invasion (30–35). Nicotine has been shown to induce
the phosphorylation of different subtypes of calpains, resulting in
enhanced cell migration or, more specifically, lung cancer
metastasis (10, 33).
Although numerous studies indicated the role of nicotine
exposure in tumor promotion, little is known about the effect of
nicotine on breast tumor development, especially on the metastatic
process of breast cancer. Here, we showed that four different
subunits of nAChRs were expressed in MCF10A and MCF7 cells,
and the expression of these subunits was not affected by nicotine
exposure. However, the treatment with nicotine augmented the
activity of PKC in these cells. Although nicotine stimulated DNA
synthesis as well as the S-phase entry of these cells under serumstarved conditions, the suppression of PKC activity did not
significantly block the growth-promoting effects of nicotine.
Furthermore, nicotine exposure induced both ‘‘normal’’ mammary
epithelial and mammary cancer cells to migrate under serumstarved conditions, which could be suppressed by either nAChR or
PKC inhibitor. Acting as a downstream effector of PKC, cdc42 was
identified as a major effector in this nicotine-mediated action to
promote migratory activity. Together, our investigation suggests
that nicotine mobilizes PKC and cdc42 signaling in both normal
mammary epithelial and mammary cancer cells to promote cell
migratory activity.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Nicotine and the nAChR inhibitor mecamylamine hydrochloride (MCA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. The PKC inhibitor
12-(2-cyanoethyl)-6,7,12,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-5H-indolo(2,3-a)pyr)pyrrolo(3,4-c)-carbazole (GO6976) was obtained from EMD Chemicals, Inc.
The anti-PKC antibody was purchased from BD PharMingen. Wortmannin
and UO16 were obtained form Cell Signaling Technology (Calbiochem).
Cell culture and transfection. Human breast cancer MCF10A and
MCF7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
MCF10A cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5%
donor horse serum, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 Ag/mL
insulin, 0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, and antibiotics.
MCF7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS, 4 mmol/L
L-glutamine, and antibiotics.
cdc42 was inserted into MSCV retroviral vector and subsequently
transiently infected into the cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were
chemically synthesized and inserted into a lentiviral vector. The vector
carrying targeted siRNA sequence was introduced into the cells. The
antisense strand siRNA was targeted against GTPase using 21-nucleotide
sequences 5¶-AAGAAGTCAAGCATTTCTGTC-3¶ for RhoA, 5¶-AAGATAACTCACCACTGTCCA-3¶ for cdc42, and 5¶-AAGTTCTTAATTTGCTTTTCC-3¶ for
Rac1 (34).
PCR and real-time PCR. Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cells
with or without treatments using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the
protocol provided by the manufacturer. Primers for the genes encoding the
subunits of nAChR were designed with the assistance of the Primer Express
software (Applied Biosystems). For real-time PCR, the gene expression was
normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the control.

PKC enzymatic assay. After various treatments, cells were lysed in the
lysis buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% NP40, 20 mmol/L MgCl2, 150
mmol/L NaCl]. The lysates were normalized for protein concentration. The
equal amount of total proteins was immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCa
antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for PKCa activity
using a PKC enzymatic kit (Millipore). Briefly, the immunoprecipitates were
mixed with the substrate cocktail, the inhibitor cocktail, and the lipid
activator in microcentrifuge tubes. After adding Mg2+/ATP cocktail
containing [g-32P]ATP, the samples were incubated at 30jC for 10 min
and then spotted on P81 phosphocellulose papers. The radioactivity of the
32
P-incorporating substrate was measured by a scintillation counter.
[3H]thymidine incorporation. MCF10A or MCF7 cells were grown in
Petri dishes until 60% to 70% confluence. Controls and treated cells were
done in triplicate. The cells were cultured in the medium containing 0.5%
serum for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were grown in the medium
containing 0.5% or 10% serum plus 4 ACi/mL of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without nicotine treatment. The cells were
labeled for 4 h at 37jC. After precipitation with cold 10% trichloroacetic
acid, the cells were dissolved in 0.5 mL of 0.1 mol/L NaOH overnight at 4jC.
The amount of radioactivity in each sample was counted using a
scintillation machine.
Cell proliferation assay. The cells (2  105) were plated in 12-well
plates and cultured in the medium containing 0.5% serum, which is
designated as day 1. Subsequently, cells treated with or without nicotine or
refed with 10% serum were grown for another 4 d. The numbers of viable
cells were determined by trypan blue staining and counted daily using a
hemocytometer.
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle distribution of DNA content was measured
using a flow cytometer as described (35). The cells, after the treatments,
were fixed in 65% DMEM and 35% ethanol for 2 to 4 h at 4jC and stained
with propidium iodide. Subsequently, the DNA profiles were analyzed using
CellQuest software.
Cell migration and invasion assay. Following various treatments, cell
migration was analyzed using Boyden cell migration assay plates (Neuro
Probe, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Untreated or
treated cells were labeled with Dil-labeled acetylated low-density lipoprotein (10 Ag/mL) for 4 h. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in phenol
red–free medium at 10,000/25 AL. Each experiment was performed in
triplicate and three separate experiments were performed in each
experimental group.
Monolayer wound-healing assay. Cells were seeded and allowed to
grow to 90% confluent. A cell scraper was used to wipe away the cell
monolayer on one side of the start line that had been drawn on the bottom
of the plate. Wounded monolayer was washed four times with the medium
to remove cell debris. Cells were then treated. Twenty-four hours later, the
wounded areas were photographed at various time points with the
assistance of the landmarks drawn on the undersurface of the plate.
Experimental lung metastasis assay. MCF7 cells (1  106) were
injected into the tail veins of nude mice. A group of 15 mice was
peritoneally injected with nicotine (30 Ag/mouse) every 2 d (36). Another
group of the same numbers of mice was left untreated. Five mice from each
group were sacrificed at 3 and 4 wk after tumor cell injection. The lung
tissues were isolated and slides were prepared. After staining with H&E, the
approximate number of foci of blue-stained metastatic tumor cells present
in the lung was estimated with an Olympus dissecting microscope. The
scoring system was used to score the degree of metastasis based on the
estimated counts: , no blue cells; +, about 1 to 50 blue cells; ++, about 50 to
100 blue cells; +++, about 100 to 200 blue cells (36).
Immunoblotting. Following treatments, cell lysates were prepared and
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gels. Membranes were incubated
with the designated primary antibody (1:1,000 for all antibodies) overnight
in a cold room at 4jC. Bound primary antibodies were reacted with
corresponding second antibodies for 2 h and detected by chemiluminescence.
Statistical analysis. Three to five independent repeats were conducted
in all experiments. Error bars represent these repeats. A Student’s t test was
used and a P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Migration Promotion of Breast Cells by Nicotine

Results
Activation of PKC by nicotine treatment in breast epithelial
and cancer cell lines. It is known that nAChRs are expressed on
the surface not only of neuronal cells but also of lung epithelia and
vascular endothelial cells, through which nicotine affects various
biological or pathobiological processes, including angiogenesis,
ischemia, or growth promotion (7–12). To explore whether
nicotine could influence breast cancer development, the gene
expression of nAChRs in normal breast epithelial-like MCF10A
cells and breast cancer MCF7 cells was examined using PCR
technique. Total mRNAs from these cells were isolated, and
subsequently, the gene expression of each nAChR subunit was
analyzed (Fig. 1A). The results from PCR revealed that nAChR a5,
a7, a9, and h4 were consistently expressed in both cells. The
expressions of the genes of other nAChR subunits were
undetectable in these cells (data not shown). To determine
whether nicotine could stimulate nAChR expression, the cells
were treated with nicotine and the levels of nAChR a5, a7, a9, and
h4 expression were measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 1B). The
amount of the gene expression of each nAChR subunit in
untreated cells was similar as that in treated cells.
Nicotine exposure has been shown to rapidly increase ERK
activation as well as serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3.
Studies also showed that nicotine is able to stimulate PI3K/Akt and

Ras/Raf pathways (21, 22). We previously showed that nicotine
treatment up-regulates PKC activity in mouse lung epithelial cells
(9, 28). It has been reported that nicotine receptor engagement
correlates well with the migration promotion of human lung cancer
cell, in which PKC plays a crucial role (10). Because the phorbol
ester and calcium-dependent isoforms of PKC are predominantly
expressed in many types of cells and their activity is involved in
growth promotion (23–26), the expression of PKCa in MCF7 or
MCF10A cells with regard to nicotine treatment was first examined
by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). A similar level of PKCa expression
was recognized by the antibody in both breast cancer cell lines with
or without the treatment, indicating that nicotine plays no role in
the expression of this kinase. To determine whether nicotine
treatment affects PKCa activity, the kinase activity was measured
using a PKC-specific kinase activity assay (Fig. 2B). After growing
the cells in the medium containing 0.5% serum for 24 h, a basal
activity of this kinase was detected in MCF7 and MCF10A cells
(Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 6). In contrast, the kinase activity was
dramatically increased after nicotine exposure under serumstarved conditions (about 4- to 5-fold; Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 7) or
refed with 10% serum (about 5- to 6-fold; Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 9).
The addition of MCA (a nAChR inhibitor) abrogated the induction
of PKCa activity mediated by nicotine in serum-starved cells
(Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 8) but had no negative effects on the cells
refed with serum (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 10). The expression and
activity of other PKC isoforms in nicotine-treated cells did not
change in comparison with that in untreated cells (data not
shown). Therefore, the data suggest that nicotine, through its
receptor, activates PKCa in these breast cells.
Effect of nicotine engagement on breast cancer growth.
Emerging evidence shows the potential growth-promoting activity
rendered by nicotine (21, 22). Increase in cell proliferation is a crucial
step in tumorigenesis. Therefore, we used [3H]thymidine incorporation assay to test if nicotine treatment has an effect on DNA uptake
in MCF7 (Fig. 3A, left) and MCF10A (Fig. 3B, right) cells. After
growing in the medium containing 0.5% serum for 48 h, MCF7 and
MCF10A cells were treated with nicotine under serum-starved
conditions or after refeeding with 10% serum in the presence of
[3H]thymidine. Subsequently, rates of DNA synthesis were measured.
Under serum-depleted conditions, little [3H]thymidine incorporation
was observed in either MCF7 or MCF10A cells (Fig. 3A, left and right,
lane 1). A moderate amount of [3H]thymidine (about 2- to 3-fold)
was incorporated in nicotine-treated cells under serum-starved
conditions (Fig. 3A, left and right, lane 2). The higher rate of
[3H]thymidine intake (4- to 5-fold) was seen in the cells refed with
10% serum (Fig. 3A, left and right, lane 3). However, the addition of
nicotine and 10% serum into starved cells caused an even greater
increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation into their genomes (about
5- to 6-fold; Fig. 3A, left and right, lane 4). We further determined the
role of nAChR or PKC in nicotine-mediated DNA synthesis
promotion. The addition of MCA or GO6976 blocked [3H]thymidine
incorporation in nicotine-treated MCF7 and MCF10A cells (Fig. 3A,
left and right, lanes 5 and 6). The effect of nicotine on cell
proliferation was confirmed by the assay for cell growth. After 24 h of
serum starvation, MCF7 or MCF10A cells were grown in the medium
containing 0.5% or 10% serum or with nicotine or for 4 consecutive
days (Fig. 3B). The cells exposed to nicotine, such as those cultured
in the growth medium, were consistently dividing in the medium
lacking serum over the testing period.
Next, we tested if nicotine was able to promote cell cycle
progression in the cells. After serum depletion for 24 h, MCF10A

Figure 2. PKC activation in nicotine-treated MCF cells. A, the cells were treated with nicotine (0.5 Amol/L) for 30 min, and cell lysates were extracted for immunoblotting
analysis. h-Actin was used to determine equal loading of total protein per lane. B, after nicotine treatment in the presence or absence of MCA (50 nmol/L), the
cells were harvested and lysates were prepared for PKCa activity assay. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD.

and MCF7 cells were stimulated with nicotine for 4 h and cell cycle
analysis was performed to measure the percentage of the cells in
the S phase (Fig. 3C and D). Under serum depletion, there were in
general very low percentages of MCF10A and MCF7 cells in the cell
cycle beyond S phase (<4%; Fig. 3D, lanes 1 and 4). In contrast,
nicotine exposure caused a more than 2-fold increase in the Sphase population of both MCF10A and MCF7 cells in comparison
with untreated controls (Fig. 3D, lanes 2 and 5). After refeeding
with 10% serum, the percentage of both cells in the S phase was
increased to f3-fold, as expected (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 6). Together,
the data indicate that nicotine partially mimics mitogenic
stimulation and promotes cell cycle progression or proliferation
in MCF10A or MCF7 cells.
Nicotine treatment promotes the migratory activity of
MCF10A and MCF7 cells. Growth factors, such as EGF or
insulin-like growth factor, stimulate not only cell proliferation but
also migration. Nicotine is able to activate various intracellular
signaling pathways that promote cell growth or survival (21, 22). We
further examined whether nicotine exposure affects migration of
MCF breast cells using the Boyden chamber and cell wound-healing
assays. The Boyden chamber assay revealed that the migration
phenomenon in MCF10A or MCF7 cells was undetectable when
growing in the medium containing 0.5% serum (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and
7). The addition of nicotine, under serum-depleted conditions,
increased the number of the migratory cells (>2-fold; Fig. 4A, lanes 2
and 8), the magnitudes of which are similar as those refed with 10%
serum (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 9). The addition of GO6976 dramatically
suppressed the nicotine-induced migratory activity in serumstarved MCF10A and MCF7 cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 10), but the
inhibition of PI3K/Akt by wortmannin (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 11) or
MAP/ERK signaling by UO16 (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 12) had no effect
on the promotion of migration mediated by nicotine. Collectively,
the data indicate that nicotine, through mobilizing PKC signaling
pathway, promotes migration in the breast cancer cells.
We then tested the effect of nicotine on MCF7 cell migration using
a wound-healing assay (Fig. 4B). MCF7 cells were unable to migrate

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

under serum-starved conditions. Following nicotine treatment, the
starved cells displayed a high capacity to migrate to the wounded
area. However, in the presence of MCA or GO6976, the migration
mediated by nicotine was completely suppressed. The addition of
UO16 had no effect on nicotine-induced MCF7 cell migration.
Consistently, the treatment with wortmannin to block PI3K/Akt
signaling did not affect nicotine-induced wound healing (data not
shown). Together, the data strongly suggest that nicotine, like growth
factors, functions through its receptor and governs multiple downstream pathways. Among these signaling pathways, PKC seems to be
involved in the regulation of the activity of cell migration.
To further test whether nicotine is able to promote metastasis,
experimental lung metastasis assay was performed, which has been
used frequently to detect micrometastases (36–38). MCF7 cells that
are known to be poorly metastatic or invasive in nude mice (36–38)
were used. After injecting MCF7 cells into the tail veins of nude
mice, a group of mice was peritoneally injected with nicotine every
2 days for 28 days and another group with the same amount of
mice was left untreated. Subsequently, a metastatic phenotype was
examined in the lungs harvested from mice treated with nicotine
for 21 and 28 days or from untreated mice (Table 1). Four weeks
after tumor cell injection, there were abundant blue-stained tumor
cells deposited around vessels in the lung from nicotine-treated
mouse (Fig. 4C). In comparison, there was no micrometastasis in
the lungs of mice without the administration of nicotine. Thus, the
in vivo data further support the notion that nicotine facilitates the
process of tumor metastasis.
cdc42 functions as a downstream effector of PKC to
promote the migratory activity mediated by nicotine. GTPases
have been reported to act downstream of PKC to regulate cell
adhesion or migration (34). Therefore, it led us to explore the
involvement of GTPases in nicotine-induced migratory promotion.
To evaluate the individual role of each GTPase, the expression of
RhoA, Rac1, and cdc42 and the inhibition of their expression by
siRNAs were first examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A and B).
MCF7 cells express RhoA, Rac1, and cdc42. After introducing the

corresponding siRNAs into MCF7 cells, the levels of protein
expressions of these GTPases were dramatically suppressed (6- to
8-fold). The expression of cdc42 in MCF10A cells, after the
introduction of siRNA-cdc42, was also examined and the amount
of the protein was reduced (f7-fold) in comparison with the
control.
Before testing the effect of these GTPases on nicotine-induced
migratory activity, cdc42 was ectopically expressed in MCF7 or
MCF10A cells (Fig. 5C). A significant increased amount of
exogenous cdc42 (f4-fold) was detected by the antibody in both
cells. Subsequently, Boyden chamber assays were then conducted
(Fig. 5D). The suppression of cdc42 by siRNA dramatically blocked
the nicotine-induced migration in serum-starved MCF7 cells
(Fig. 5D, left, lane 4). The introduction of siRNA into the cells to
suppress either RhoA or Rac1 did not affect nicotine-mediated
migratory activity (Fig. 5B, left, lanes 5 and 6). Transient
overexpression of cdc42 in MCF7 cells further augmented the
magnitude of nicotine-mediated migratory activity (Fig. 5B, left,
lane 7). Because the inhibitory effect of cdc42 siRNA on migration
was similar as that occurred after treatment with the PKC inhibitor
GO6976 (comparing Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 8), it indicates that both
molecules are involved in this nicotine-mediated action. To
determine the possible linear relationship between PKC and
cdc42, serum-starved MCF7 cells with transient overexpression of
cdc42 were treated with nicotine in the presence of GO6976 and

then subjected to the Boyden chamber assay. The suppression of
PKC dramatically suppressed the nicotine-mediated migratory
effect of the cells regardless of the augmented expression of cdc42
(Fig. 5B, left, lane 8). The similar results were obtained from
MCF10A cells (Fig. 5B, right). Overall, the data suggest that cdc42
participates in nicotine-mediated migration and its activation
depends on the existence or activity of PKC.

Discussion
Tobacco smoke has been implicated in the promotion of the
onset of not only lung cancer but also malignancies in various
other organs (1–3). Increasing incidences of human cancers caused
by secondhand smoking have drawn a lot of attention for the needs
to understand the etiology of the malignancies induced by such
environmental smoking pollution. Nicotine is originally thought to
be mainly responsible for tobacco addiction. However, many
studies now reveal that this tobacco component is able to
modulate various key biological activities in nonneuronal tissues
(7–12). In particular, nicotine has been shown to promote survival
of many cell types, including keratinocytes and head or neck tumor
cells (11, 39). Through associating with nicotine receptor, nicotine
has been shown to modulate the expressions of a diverse set of
genes, the products of which are involved in the regulation of gene
transcription, RNA processing, and protein modification (21). In

Figure 4. Acceleration of cell migration and wound
healing by nicotine exposure. A, after culturing in the
medium containing 0.5% serum for 24 h, cells were
untreated (lanes 1 and 7 ) or treated with nicotine
(lanes 2 and 8 ), 10% serum (lanes 3 and 9), nicotine plus
GO6976 (lanes 4 and 10 ), nicotine plus wortmannin
(lanes 5 and 11), and nicotine plus UO16 (lanes 6 and 12).
Cells then were labeled with 10 Ag/mL Dil-labeled
acetylated low-density lipoprotein for 4 h at 37jC.
Subsequently, cells were loaded in Boyden chamber and
incubated overnight. The migratory cells at the bottom
wells were measured by fluorescence. Columns, mean of

lung cancer, studies indicate that nicotine exposure facilitates the
spread of the cancer in the body (10, 33). In the process of tumor
promotion, nicotine has been shown to stimulate phosphorylation
of A-calpains and m-calpains to enhance proteolytic activity and
further to accelerate cell invasion (10, 33). Therefore, nicotine
exposure seems to be able to promote not only cancer cell survival
but also tumor metastasis.
Here, our study shows that human breast cancer MCF10A and
MCF7 cells, like lung epithelial cells or keratinocytes, express at
least four subunits of nAChR. Based on the similarity of the
expression patterns of nAChR subunits in human breast cancer cells
and cells from other types of tumors, we have examined the effect of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

nicotine in regulation of cell migration as well as on growth. We
showed in this study that nicotine exposure is moderately mitogenic
in serum-starved MCF10A and MCF7 cells. Furthermore, nicotine
treatment, via stimulating PKC and cdc42 signaling cascade,
promotes cell migration and invasion as measured by the Boyden
chamber and wound-healing assays. This nicotine-mediated
migratory activity requires the engagement of nicotine receptor.
Therefore, from the experiments using human breast cancer cell
lines, we conclude that one way for nicotine to promote breast
tumor development may be through potentiating metastasis.
Cell surface growth factors and adhesion molecules are often
involved in regulation of mitogenesis and metastasis that are

critical steps during tumor development. It has been shown that
the addition of nicotine mobilizes Ras and its downstream
signaling pathways in mouse lung epithelial cells, resulting in the
up-regulation of cyclin D1 and subsequent entry of cell cycle
following G1 stimulation (9). Furthermore, on nicotine exposure,

the lung cells were unable to arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle,
which renders the cells a genetic background for the establishment
of genetic instability (28). Our current study using breast epitheliallike or cancer cell lines again shows that nicotine is able to
mobilize multiple intracellular signaling pathways to modulate

growth- or survival-related activities. Through binding to the
receptor, nicotine disrupts the G1 restriction point induced by
serum starvation and, at the same time, stimulates cell migration
or invasion. It is possible that nicotine, after binding to its receptor,
recruits angiogenic or migration-related factors to the surface of
cells and creates a high concentration of ligands near the receptor
for the potentiation of cell migration. In such a cross-talk between
nicotine receptor and angiogenic receptors, nicotine promotes
interactions of intracellular angiogenic factors and their receptors.
Our study also showed that nicotine has a profound effect on cell
proliferation after the cells were refed with the growth medium
containing 10% serum (Fig. 2A). It is also conceivable that nicotine
synergizes with growth factor receptor-induced pathways, which
often occur in the cooperation between vascular endothelial
growth factor and other growth factors (40–42).
PKC has been reported to regulate the expression or structural
change of cytoskeleton-associated proteins, which further affects
cytoskeleton reorganization and cell invasion (34, 43, 44). On
mitogenic stimulation, PKC, acting as a second messenger,
associates with the plasma membrane and then transmits signals
to downstream effectors, including GTPases (34, 43, 44). In human
endothelial cells, cdc42 has been shown to function downstream
of PKC for reorganization of stress fibers after exposing to a stress
environment (34). In this study, we showed that the suppression
of PKC or cdc42 blocks nicotine-mediated migratory activity in
breast cancer cells. The overexpression of cdc42 is able to further
enhance the migration. In contrast, although cdc42 was overexpressed, there were a few migratory cells after PKC activation is
inhibited. Given the fact that PKC activation occurs at the early
stage and the plasma membrane level on various stimulations
and GTPases often function as intracellular effectors, our data
suggest that PKC and cdc42 work in a linear signaling
relationship to transduce the signals initiated by nicotine to
accelerate cell migration.
Many growth factors and their downstream effectors are
aberrantly activated or overexpressed, which contribute to growth
deregulation in cancer. It has been reported that the addition of
nicotine increases EGF receptor (EGFR) expression in colon cells
(14). Therefore, it is possible that nicotine could elevate the
sensitivity of breast epithelial or cancer cells to growth factors and
subsequently promote cell proliferation and metastasis. Because it

is known that src is responsible for the phosphorylation of both
EGFR and nAChR, it would be interesting to determine if src acts
as a mediator to transmit the signals elicited by nicotine to EGFR
pathway.
MCF10A is a spontaneously immortalized but nontransformed
human mammary epithelial cell line derived from the breast tissue
of a patient with fibrocystic changes (45). MCF10A cells have been
considered as normal breast epithelial cells because these cells
cannot grow in soft agar and are dependent on growth factors and
hormones in the cultured medium for growth and survival (45).
Our investigations show that the mammary epithelial MCF10A
cells, like MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, express the same subunits
of nAChR, and nicotine treatment does not alter the expression
pattern of each subunit. The magnitudes of growth and migratory
promotion by nicotine in these two cell lines are very similar.
Moreover, both PKC and cdc42 are involved in nicotine-induced
cell migration. Thus, the data suggest that the same machinery in
these two different cell lines is used by nicotine to enhance the
migratory or proliferation activity.
In summary, we have shown that nicotine treatment can
stimulate human breast epithelial-like MCF10A as well as cancer
MCF7 cells to proliferate, migrate, and wound heal. Metastasis
plays a critical role in the process of tumorigenesis. The results also
provided an insight into how nicotine potentiates cell migration in
normal breast epithelial or cancer cells. Overall, our study provides
evidence to suggest that nicotine is a possible component for the
initiation of breast cancer induced by secondhand smoking. The
present investigation also warrants a caution for the clinical use of
nicotine to relieve chronic pain or aid in the cessation of cigarette
smoking.
