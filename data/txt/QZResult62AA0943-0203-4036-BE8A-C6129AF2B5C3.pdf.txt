BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection improves outcomes for patients with early-stage non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). To the authors’ knowledge, there are no published prospective trials to date of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical
resection administered exclusively in older patients. In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant
chemotherapy in older patients in a Veterans Health Administration cohort. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgical resection for
American Joint Committee on Cancer stages IB to III NSCLC between 2001 and 2011 were analyzed. Data regarding patient demographics and comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and primary treatment were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups based
on age at diagnosis: those aged <70 years and those aged 70 years. The primary exposure was use of adjuvant chemotherapy. A
Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the significance of patient characteristics. Survival curves were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method and group comparisons were performed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: The analysis included 7593
patients who underwent surgical resection for stage IB to stage III NSCLC. Among these, 2897 patients (38%) were aged 70 years.
The percentage of older patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy was approximately one-half that of younger patients who did
so (15.3% vs 31.6%; P<.0001). Carboplatin-based doublets were used most often in all patients (64.6%). Both younger patients (hazard
ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.86) and older patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.92) were found
to have a lower risk of death with receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients derive a similar magnitude of
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy as younger patients and therefore adjuvant chemotherapy should not be withheld based on age
alone. Cancer 2015;121:2578-85. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

INTRODUCTION
The standard of care for patients with early-stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is surgical resection. However, despite complete resection, a substantial percentage of patients with NSCLC will experience disease recurrence.1,2 As a consequence, the 5-year survival rate for patients with early-stage NSCLC after complete surgical resection ranges from 45%
to 70%.2-9
Studies conducted in the last decade have provided evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection
improves outcomes for patients with resected stages II and IIIA disease and selected patients with stage I (large tumor size)
NSCLC.10-14 A recent meta-analysis of these newer trials,15 which included 5 trials and 4584 patients, found a benefit for
adjuvant chemotherapy. The magnitude of benefit was an 11% reduction in the risk of death and an absolute survival benefit of approximately 5% at 5 years. Another meta-analysis based on 34 trials and 8447 patients found a benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery alone, with a 4% absolute increase in survival at 5 years (64% vs 60%).16
Similarly, in a database analysis of patients treated within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an 18% decreased risk of death after surgical resection in patients with stages IB to IIIA
NSCLC.17
With a median age at diagnosis of 70 years, NSCLC results in a significant disease burden among the elderly.18 To
the best of our knowledge, there are no prospective trials of adjuvant chemotherapy limited to older patients published to
date. Among patients enrolled on clinical trials, which are open to patients of any age, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy appear to be maintained among the elderly.19 However, <10% of patients enrolled on these trials were aged 70 years

and therefore the strength of this finding is limited. In the
current study, we sought to evaluate the relative efficacy of
adjuvant chemotherapy in older patients compared with
younger patients in a Veterans Health Administration
cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a population-based retrospective study using
patient data within the US Veterans Health Administration. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the Durham VA Medical Center.
Study Population and Data Sources

The study population consisted of patients diagnosed
with stages IB to III NSCLC between January 1, 2001
and December 31, 2011 who underwent surgical resection. The following patients were excluded from the analysis: those with unknown surgery date, those with receipt
of chemotherapy within the 4 months before surgery,
those with receipt of radiotherapy within 4 months before
or after surgery, and those who died 30 days after
surgery.
The national VA Central Cancer Registry and the
VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) were queried to
obtain data for the current analysis. The VA Central Cancer Registry contains all patients diagnosed with and/or
treated for cancer in the VA health care system20 and was
used to identify the cohort of patients who met the inclusion criteria. Data regarding patient demographics, tumor
characteristics, and primary treatment were collected.
Registry data were linked to several databases in the
CDW, which is a repository of clinical and administrative
data that is updated daily. The CDW databases were used
to obtain pharmacy, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses,
and vital status data.
Exposures and Outcomes

The primary exposure was use of adjuvant chemotherapy,
defined as the administration of chemotherapy within 4
months after surgical resection. Pharmacy data from the
Decision Support System databases were used to identify
patients receiving chemotherapy, including the drug and
date of administration. Clinical and demographic factors
assessed included age at diagnosis, race (white, black, and
other/unknown), diagnosis time period (2001-2003,
2004-2005, 2006-2008, and 2009-2011), stage of disease
at the time of diagnosis (stage IB, II, or III) based on the
sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging system, marital status (unmarried, married, or
unknown), and number of comorbidities. These time
Cancer

intervals were chosen due to the natural history of the
administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected
lung cancer based on the release of data from the positive
adjuvant clinical trials from 2004 through 2005. Accurate
information regarding the drugs received was available
only for those patients diagnosed through 2008 and therefore analysis based on the type of adjuvant chemotherapy
received was restricted to the period between 2001 and
2008.
Information regarding preexisting conditions was
obtained from inpatient and outpatient administrative
data. The Charlson comorbidity index was used to classify
these comorbidities.21 This index captures many illnesses
considered to be contraindications to the administration
of chemotherapy.
Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome.
Mortality was determined by the date of death in the Veterans Administration Vital Status File, which incorporates
information from the Veterans Administration, Medicare,
and the Social Security Administration. The accuracy of
vital status from this source is comparable to the National
Death Index.22 Mortality was assessed from the date of diagnosis through July 1, 2013 (censor date).
Statistical Analysis

Demographic and clinical characteristics and patterns of
adjuvant chemotherapy use according to patient age at the
time of diagnosis were analyzed using descriptive statistics
(frequencies for categorical variables and means and
medians for continuous variables). Distributions of the
receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy based on age were compared using the chi-square test. OS was calculated as the
number of years between the date of diagnosis and either
the date of death or the censor date. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the significance of demographic and clinical
characteristics.
Patients were divided into 2 groups based on age at
diagnosis: those aged <70 years and those aged 70 years.
The 2 treatment comparisons were adjuvant chemotherapy versus no adjuvant chemotherapy and carboplatinbased versus cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for
the subset of patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2008
and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. OS curves were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and group
comparisons were performed using the log-rank test. All
significance tests were 2-sided and P values <.05 were
considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were
conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The data set included information regarding 33,860
patients diagnosed with stage IB to stage III NSCLC from
2001 to 2011. Of these patients, 7593 underwent surgical
resection as their initial treatment for NSCLC. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 6.69 years. Of the
7593 patients who underwent surgical resection, 4696
(62%) were aged <70 years and 2897 (38%) were aged
70 years. Most patients were white (83.8%) and unmarried (52%) and had stage IB disease (52%). The demographic data are presented in Table 1.
When the cohort of patients undergoing surgical
resection was evaluated based on age, a higher percentage
of older patients (70 years) compared with younger
patients (<70 years) were white (87.4% vs 81.5%;
P<.0001), married (53.9% vs 44.9%; P<.0001), and
2580

former smokers (59.2% vs 33%; P<.0001) and had
squamous cell carcinoma (43.8% vs 39.2%). A greater
percentage of older patients had stage IB disease and correspondingly a lower percentage of patients with stage III
disease and a greater percentage of older patients had a
higher Charlson comorbidity score (3) compared with
younger patients.
The percentage of older patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy was approximately one-half that of
younger patients who did so (15.3% vs 31.6%;
P<.0001). Analysis of the stage-wise distribution of
receipt of chemotherapy revealed that within the younger
cohort, 17.7% of patients with stage IB disease, 44.1% of
patients with stage II disease, and 46.1% of patients with
stage III disease received adjuvant chemotherapy. Among
older patients, the corresponding percentages were 7.1%,
24.5%, and 27.8%, respectively.
When survival of the entire cohort was evaluated by
age, there was a progressive decrease in the risk of death
observed in the latter time periods compared with the period between 2001 and 2003 in both older and younger
patients, regardless of the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Among the younger patients, compared with the
cohort diagnosed between 2001 and 2003, the relative
risk of death was 0.82 (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.73-0.91), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66-0.81), and 0.67
(95% CI, 0.60-0.76), respectively, for patients diagnosed
between 2004 and 2005, 2006 and 2008, and 2009 and
2011 after adjusting for race, marital status, stage of disease, and number of comorbidities. The corresponding
values in the older patients were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.871.10), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78-0.99), and 0.82 (95% CI,
0.71-0.94), respectively. There was no evidence of stage
shift over time (data not shown).
The percentage of patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy between 2001 and 2003 was 9.3% in the
younger patients and 4.5% in the older patients. This percentage increased by 27.8% in the younger patients and
by 16.0% in the older patients between 2001 and 2003
and 2009 and 2011.
There was an association between receipt of adjuvant
chemotherapy and longer survival that was noted to be of
similar magnitude in both older and younger patients
(Figure 1). Younger patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a 21% lower risk of death (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.86), whereas older patients
had a 19% lower risk of death (HR, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.71-0.92) (Table 2). However, when different time periods were evaluated separately, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy in the older patients was found to be statistically

significantly associated with longer survival only for
the period between 2004 and 2005. Similarly, when
the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated
by stage of disease, although there was a lower risk of
death with adjuvant chemotherapy noted in all stages
of disease, this finding was statistically significant only
in stage IB and stage II disease for older patients and
stages II and III disease for younger patients. The
maximum reduction in the risk of death was observed
in patients with stage II disease, with a 28% decrease
observed in both in the younger and the older patient
population (HR of 0.72 [95% CI, 0.62-0.85] for
younger patients and HR of 0.72 [95% CI, 0.570.91] for older patients) (Table 2).
Among patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy between 2001 and 2008 (1235 patients), 71 patients
aged <70 years (7.6%) and 24 patients aged 70 years
(8.1%) received single-agent chemotherapy. Carboplatinbased doublets were used most often in all patients
(64.6%), whereas only 25.1% of patients received
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, compared with
younger patients, a larger percentage of patients aged 70
Cancer

years received carboplatin-based chemotherapy (72% vs
62.3%; P<.0001) (Table 3).
OS was analyzed based on the type of adjuvant
chemotherapy in a subset of the cohort in the current
study, namely those patients diagnosed between 2001 and
2008. Cisplatin-based therapy was associated with a similar risk of dying compared with carboplatin-based chemotherapy in the younger patients (HR for cisplatin-based
therapy, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83-1.25). In older patients,
there was a nonsignificant 12% decreased risk of death
noted with cisplatin-based therapy (HR, 0.88; 95% CI,
0.59-1.30).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is one of the largest
population-based studies evaluating the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection of early-stage
NSCLC in older patients published to date. The main
findings of this study are that although a much smaller
population of older patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, older patients appeared to enjoy a similar magnitude
of benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with

younger patients. These benefits persisted after adjustment for stage of disease, race, marital status, comorbidity
(as calculated by the Charlson comorbidity index), and
era of diagnosis.
In this cohort, only 444 of 2897 patients aged
70 years (15.3%) received any adjuvant chemotherapy. These figures are similar to those reported in a
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare
database analysis of the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients aged >65 years.23 In this analysis, of
the 3324 eligible patients with NSCLC, only 684
(21%) received platinum-based chemotherapy. In the
current study cohort, of the 296 older patients for
whom details regarding the type of adjuvant chemotherapy were available, 263 patients (88.9%) received
platinum-based chemotherapy. Not surprisingly, only a
minority of older patients (16.9%) received cisplatinbased chemotherapy.
The outcomes noted in the current analysis are similar to those found in previous studies evaluating the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy by patient age. A large
meta-analysis of 14 randomized studies24 demonstrated
that the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not
impacted by the patient’s age. However, a major drawback
of this study was that it included trials that evaluated
agents that are no longer used today. More recent studies,
including a retrospective subset analysis of the JBR.10
study25 that used cisplatin and vinorelbine after surgical
resection of patients with stage IB and II NSCLC, evaluated this topic for a modern third-generation chemotherapy combination. This retrospective analysis found
that older patients received lower cumulative doses of the
2 agents secondary to issues with tolerability.25 However,
despite this finding, the benefit observed with adjuvant
chemotherapy in the older patients was similar to that
noted among younger patients. Fruh et al analyzed the
effects of age on cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy
2582

2004 Through 2005

using patient-level data from the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin
Evaluation (LACE) meta-analysis.26 In this analysis, they
found that older patients (70 years) received lower total
cisplatin doses compared with younger patients (<65
years) and those considered to be in the middle age category (65-69 years). They found that there were no significant differences in either OS or event-free survival among
the 3 age groups studied. Unfortunately, we were not able
to assess the amount of chemotherapy received in the
current study cohort.
Two recent population-based analyses demonstrated
similar findings.23,27 In a Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results-Medicare database analysis of 3759
patients aged >65 years, patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy had a significantly better OS (HR, 0.80;
95% CI, 0.72 to 0.89) and 5-year adjusted survival rates
(35% [95% CI, 32%-39%] vs 27% [95% CI, 25%29%]) compared with those who did not receive adjuvant
therapy.23 In the second analysis, Cuffe et al reviewed the
survival of older patients between the periods 2001
through 2003 and 2004 through 2006.27 They found that
the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in the older patients
increased from 3.3% (between 2001-2003) to 16.2%
(between 2004-2006). The 4-year survival rate for
patients aged 70 years increased significantly (47.1% in
the period 2001-2003 vs 49.9% in the period 2004-2006;
P 5.01). We found that the percentage of older patients
who received adjuvant chemotherapy actually decreased
between 2006 and 2008 (16.6%) compared with the period between 2004 and 2005 (20.6%) before increasing to
20.5% in 2009 through 2011. We believe that this may
have in part accounted for the lack of statistical significance in the benefit observed with adjuvant chemotherapy
in the latter time periods. Taken together, these results
suggest that older patients do benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy and should not be denied such treatment based
solely on age.

An interesting finding in the current analysis was
that a greater percentage of older patients had a lower
pathologic stage of disease (stage IB) at the time of diagnosis compared with younger patients (56.3% vs 49.4%).
Conversely, a lower percentage of older patients had both
stage II disease (25.1% vs 30%) and stage III disease (18%
vs 20.6%) (P<.0001). These findings are similar to previous registry-based reports in the literature. In an analysis
of the Centralized Cancer Patient Data System, O’Rourke
et al found that a higher percentage of patients aged 75
years had localized disease when compared with patients
aged 54 years (25.4% vs 15.3%).28 In another analysis,
the percentage of patients with local stage disease was
higher among those aged 75 to 84 years compared with
those aged 55 years (39% vs 26%).29 This was associated with a decline in the rate of advanced disease in the
older patients (41% vs 46%).
One of the explanations suggested for this finding
has been that older patients undergo a less complete or
aggressive staging evaluation,28 but the current study findings in a population of patients who underwent surgical
staging suggest otherwise. A more plausible explanation
may be that older patients generally have more frequent
physician visits, thereby leading to earlier detection.28
Another hypothesis may be a change in the aggressiveness
of lung cancer with increasing age.
There appears to be no difference in outcomes based
on the platinum agent used in adjuvant chemotherapy.

When compared with carboplatin, cisplatin-based therapy
appeared to have no apparent survival advantage,
although the point estimate of the HR indicated an
improved survival in older patients.
The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using a cisplatin-based doublet for adjuvant chemotherapy and recommend using
carboplatin-based regimens only for those patients who are
believed not to be candidates for cisplatin.30 These recommendations are based on multiple phase 3 trials that compared cisplatin-based doublets with observation after
surgical resection.11,12,31 A large meta-analysis of these trials, the LACE meta-analysis,15 included 5 trials and 4584
patients and found a benefit for chemotherapy with regard
to both OS (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96 [P 5.005]) and
disease-free survival (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91
[P 5 .001]), leading to the recommendation to use
cisplatin-based therapy. In what to our knowledge is the
only trial to use carboplatin (Cancer and Leukemia Group
B 9633),13 treatment was limited to patients with resected
stage IB disease only. Although the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel was associated with a 17% decrease in
the risk of death, this finding did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64-1.08 [P 5.12]). It is interesting to note that in the LACE meta-analysis, there was no
significant survival advantage observed for cisplatin-based
chemotherapy among patients with stage IB disease either
(HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78-1.10).15
A major advantage to the current study is its large
sample size of patients treated at various facilities with a
single-payer system, thereby providing a real-world view
of the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy. The main limitations of the current study include the absence of data
regarding performance status, which is an important factor that guides the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy. In an effort to minimize the influence of
patients who were in poor health and therefore had a
worse overall prognosis, we excluded those patients who
died within 30 days after surgery and those who received
radiotherapy and adjusted outcomes based on comorbidity score. We were not able to capture the use of adjuvant
chemotherapy outside the VA system. In addition, given
the nature of the VA health care system, access to care is
not a major concern and therefore closer follow-up is
more likely. This is especially important in older
patients, who are more likely to experience adverse
effects of chemotherapy.19,25 In addition, the vast majority of the patients in the current study were males, which
is not surprising considering that this was a VA cohort.
Therefore, the generalizability of these results to other
2583

Original Article

populations, including females, needs to be considered.
The type of adjuvant chemotherapy used was available
only for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2008;
however, we do not believe that this significantly
impacted the interpretation of the current study
findings.
A smaller percentage of older patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for early-stage NSCLC.
Among patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy in
the current study, older patients appeared to derive a similar magnitude of survival benefit with adjuvant platinumbased chemotherapy as younger patients after surgical
resection of early-stage NSCLC. Chemotherapy with
carboplatin-based doublets appears to provide a similar
survival advantage as cisplatin-based doublet therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should not be denied to older
patients based on age alone.
