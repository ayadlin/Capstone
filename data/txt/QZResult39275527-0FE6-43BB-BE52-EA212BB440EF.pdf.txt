BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable B-cell malignancy, and patients with this disease have the poorest prognosis among all patients with B-cell lymphomas. The signaling pathways that trigger MCL escape from immune surveillance are
unclear. Because Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiate innate and adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens, the authors
investigated the impact of TLR signaling in MCL cells. METHODS: TLR expression was examined in MCL cell lines and in primary
tumors. The examination focused on TLR4 and its ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on MCL cells and their function on MCL proliferation and immune evasion. RESULTS: MCL cells expressed multiple TLRs, and TLR4 was among the highest expressed molecules. The
activation of TLR4 signaling in MCL cells by LPS induced MCL proliferation and up-regulated the secretion of cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). LPS-pretreated MCL cells inhibited the proliferation and cytolytic
activity of T cells by secreted IL-10 and VEGF, and neutralizing antibodies against these cytokines restored their functions. Similar
results were observed in TLR4-positive/myeloid differentiation 88 (MyD88)-positive primary lymphoma cells but not in TLR4-positive/MyD88-negative primary lymphoma cells from patients with MCL. Knockdown of TLR4 on MCL cells abrogated the effect of LPS
on MCL cells in term of cell growth or secretion of the cytokines and evasion of the immune system. CONCLUSIONS: The current
results indicated that TLR4 signaling triggers a cascade that leads to MCL growth and evasion from immune surveillance. Thus, TLR4

INTRODUCTION
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable B-cell neoplasm that constitutes about 6% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.1 It
is characterized by a specific t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, leading to the overexpression of cyclin D1.2 Most patients
manifest with advanced-stage disease at initial diagnosis, and the prognosis is poorest among patients with B-cell lymphoma, with a short median survival of approximately 3 to 5 years.3,4 Although progress has been made in MCL treatment
in the past decade, persistent remissions usually are not achieved, and the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory
MCL is still challenging. Therefore, new insights into the biology of MCL and novel treatment options are needed to
improve the clinical outcome in MCL patients.
Dysregulated chronic inflammation can cause oncogenesis and often provides growth and angiogenic factors, which
enhance proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells.5 Many of these events are mediated by direct recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).6 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are type-I transmembrane receptors that are composed of an ectodomain with leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic domain called the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)
domain.6 TLRs directly recognize a series of PAMPs, including foreign pathogens from bacteria, virus, and fungi; induce
the release of inflammatory cytokines; and link innate and adaptive immune responses.7,8 Recently it was reported that,
TLRs, which normally have expression restricted to immune cells or nonimmune cells, also are expressed in tumors and
play important roles in tumor biology.9,10 In pituitary tumors and glioblastoma, the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide

(LPS) inhibited the growth of TLR4-positive tumor
cells11 and induced antitumor effects.12 Another study
demonstrated that the activation of TLR4 on tumor cells
in vitro inhibited subsequent tumor growth in vivo in a
rat prostate cancer model and in a B16 murine melanoma
model.13 However, phase 2 clinical trials in lung cancer
indicated that the administration of LPS did not have any
antitumor effects.14 Conversely, other evidence indicated
that triggering of TLR4 on human myeloma and ovarian
cancer promotes tumor proliferation and induces chemoresistance.15-17 Activation of TLR5 by flagellin reportedly
suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth in breast
cancer18 but promotes the proliferation of gastric cancer
cells.19 Therefore, the functional roles of TLR signaling in
cancer cells remain to be further elucidated. The objective
of the current study was to investigate the role of TLRs
and their signaling in MCL cells. We observed that TLRs,
especially TLR4, were highly expressed on human MCL
cells and that TLR4 signaling was functional in the cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Cell Lines

The sources of primary MCL cells for this study included
bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples
obtained from patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed
MCL after obtaining their informed consent. Among
these samples, 7 bone marrow aspirates were derived from
4 patients with newly diagnosed MCL and 3 patients with
relapsed MCL who had bone marrow involvement. Samples of peripheral blood that contained leukemic MCL
cells were collected from 5 patients with relapsed MCL
who also had bone marrow involvement. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation, and MCL cells were isolated

using anti-B-lymphocyte antigen (anticluster of differentiation 19 [anti-CD19]) magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi
Biotec, Auburn, Calif). Purified MCL cells were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until use. Four human MCL
lines (SP53, Mino, Granta 519 [G519], and Jeko-1;
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va) were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma Chemical
Company, St. Louis, Mo) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, Ga),
penicillin (100 U/mL; Sigma Chemical Company), and
streptomycin (100 lg/mL; Sigma Chemical Company).
The bone marrow stromal cell line S17 was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Eric Davis (The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex) and used in
coculture with primary MCL cells to sustain their survival
ex vivo.
RNA Isolation: Reverse TranscriptasePolymerase Chain Reaction

The cells were lysed, and total RNAs were isolated from
the cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia,
Calif) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Combinational DNAs were generated using the M-MuLV Reverse
Transcription System (Fermentas Inc., Hanover, Md) and
then were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The TLR primers that we used are listed in Table 1. PCR
conditions consisted of 35 cycles at 94 C for 30 seconds,
55 C for 40 seconds, and 72 C for 50 seconds for denaturing, annealing, and extension, respectively, followed by an
extension at 72 C for 7 minutes. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control. The PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels.
Flow Cytometry

Phycoerythrin-labeled antihuman TLR4 and isotypematched control antibody were obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, Calif). Data were acquired with a

TLR4 Short-Hairpin RNA Transfection
of Tumor Cells by Lentivirus

MCL cells were transfected using human TLR4 or control
short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) according to the
manufacturerâ€™s protocol to knockdown TLR4 expression
in the cells. In this study, these untreated cells were
divided into wild-type (wt) cells, control shRNA-transfected cells, and TLR4-specific shRNA-transfected cells,
respectively.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-Carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-Sulfophenyl)-2H-Tetrazolium
Assay

Cells (1  104/100 lL per well) were seeded into 96-well,
flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning,
NY) and cultured for 4 days. Primary MCL cells were
cocultured with the irradiated bone marrow stromal cell
line S17. LPS (0-1000 ng/mL; InvivoGen; San Diego,
Calif) was added to the culture. At the end of each
treatment, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)
reagent (Promega, Fitchburg, Wis) was added to the culture medium for 2 hours, and the absorption was qualified
using an automatic microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski,
Vt) at 490 nm.
Preparation of Tumor-Cell Culture Medium

MCL cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 complete medium with or without LPS stimulation. Forty-eight hours
later, supernatants were harvested, filtered, and concentrated 10-fold using an Amicon Ultra Filter (Millipore,
Bedford, Mass). Concentrated tumor-cell culture medium (TCCM) was divided into aliquots and stored at
80 C until use. Medium control was prepared from
freshly prepared RPMI-1640 complete medium in a manner similar to that used for TCCM preparation.
Western Blot Analysis

Western blot analysis was used to detect protein expression in MCL cells, as described previously.20 Antihuman
myeloid differentiation 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor jB
(NF-jB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the p38 mitogen activated
protein kinase (p38), protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), p-JNK, p-ERK, p-NF-jB, and p-Akt
(all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass),
TLR4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and b-actin (Sigma
Chemical Company) monoclonal antibodies were used.

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for interleukin 6
(IL-6), IL-10, IL-18, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b)
were used to measure the secreted cytokines. Cell culture
supernatants were collected on day 2, and the amounts of
secreted IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, VEGF, and TGF-b in the
supernatants were quantified using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Rockland, Md).
T-Cell Proliferation Assay

Allogeneic CD3-positive T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy
donors using magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec,
Cambridge, Mass). CD3-positive T cells were labeled
with 56-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFSE) (5 lM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) for 10
minutes at 37 C. After washing, T cells (1  105/100 lL
per well) were seeded into 96-well, U-bottomed tissue culture plates (Corning Inc.) for 5 days in 5% CO2 in Aim-V
medium supplemented with 10% pooled human AB serum (T-cell medium). T cells were activated with antiCD3 and CD28 antibodies. Medium or TCCM from
MCL cells were added to the cultures. Flow cytometric
analysis was used to detect the dilution of CFSE.
Generation of Tumor-Reactive, AlloantigenSpecific, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Lines and
Cytotoxicity Assay

Allogeneic CD3-positive T cells were cocultured in T-cell
medium with irradiated SP53 or G519-wt, respectively.
After 7 days of coculture, CD3-positive T cells were harvested and restimulated with newly irradiated tumor cells.
The cultures were fed with fresh T-cell medium containing recombinant IL-2 (10 IU/mL), IL-7 (5 ng/mL), and
IL-15 (5 ng/mL; all from R&D Systems). After at least 4
repeated cycles of in vitro restimulation, T-cell lines were
generated. The T-cell lines were expanded in T-cell medium that contained recombinant IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15
for 2 weeks and were subjected to functional tests. A
standard, 4-hour chromium-51 release assay was performed to measure cytolytic activity of the T-cell lines
with target cells, including the stimulatory MCL cell lines
SP53 and G519, and primary tumor cells isolated from
patients with MCL, as described previously.20
Statistical Analysis

The Student t test was used to compare various experimental groups. A P value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Unless otherwise indicated, the values
provided are means and standard deviations (SDs).

Figure 1. The expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is illustrated in human mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines (SP53, Jeko-1,
Mino, and Granta 519 [G519]) and in primary MCL cells. (A) Polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed mRNA expression of
TLR1 through TLR10. GAPDH indicates glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. (B) Western blot analysis revealed protein
expression of TLR1 through TLR10 and of myeloid differentiation 88 (MyD88) in MCL cell lines and primary tumor cells from 4
patients (PT1, PT2, PT3, and PT4). Flow cytometric analysis revealed (C) surface TLR4 expression in 4 MCL lines and in control
stromal S17 cells and (D) TLR4 expression in primary tumor cells from 11 patients with MCL and in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and B cells from 7 healthy donors (PT).

RESULTS
Toll-Like Receptors Are Expressed on Human
Mantle Cell Lymphoma Cells

We first analyzed the expression of TLR1-10 in human primary MCL cells and cell lines by reverse transcriptase (RT)PCR. Surprisingly, all tested MCL cells expressed multiple
TLRs (Fig. 1A). We focused our study on TLR4, because it
has a high level of mRNA expression among all TLRs.
Consistent with the RT-PCR results, Western blot analysis
(Fig. 1B) and flow cytometry (Fig. 1C-D) also revealed that
total and surface TLR4 proteins were present in human
MCL cell lines and primary MCL cells from 11 patients,
whereas the bone marrow stromal cell line S17 expressed little TLR4 surface protein. The levels of TLR4 were significantly higher in primary MCL cells than in normal
PBMCs (P < .01) (Fig. 1D) or B cells (P < .01). An important contributing protein in the TLR4 signaling cascade,
MyD88, also was expressed in MCL cell lines and in 2 of 4
primary cells from patients with MCL (Fig. 1B). The widespread expression of TLR4 on human MCL cells indicated
that TLR4 signaling may play a role in tumor biology.
TLR4-Specific Ligand Lipopolysaccharide
Promotes Proliferation of Human Mantle Cell
Lymphoma Cells

Next, we examined whether TLR4 signaling was functional in human MCL cells. Upon stimulation with
TLR4 ligand LPS at different concentrations, the proliferCancer

ation of SP53, Jeko-1, Mino, and G519 cells was
increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). LPS also
promoted the proliferation of TLR4-positive/MyD88positive primary MCL cells but not TLR4-positive/
MyD88-negative primary MCL cells (P < .01 compared
with medium control) (Fig. 2B). However, LPS did not
increase the proliferation of S17 cells or normal PBMCs
from blood donors (Fig. 2C).
To confirm the role of TLR4 in LPS-induced MCL
proliferation, we knocked down tlr4 gene expression in
SP53 and G519 cells by using TLR4-specific shRNA lentiviral particles. Upon transfection, TLR4-specific shRNA
reduced the expression of TLR4 total protein (Fig. 2D) and
surface protein (Fig. 2E) by 78% in SP53 cells and by 66%
in G519 cells, respectively, whereas the control shRNA did
not. SP53-knockdown and G519-knockdown cell lines had
a reduced response to LPS stimulation compared with
shRNA control cells (from P < .05 to P < .01) (Fig. 2F).

of Inflammatory Cytokines by Mantle Cell

We next investigated whether TLR4 signaling in MCL
could activate the expression of cytokines. It is noteworthy
that LPS stimulation significantly up-regulated the secretion of IL-6, IL-10, and VEGF in MCL cell lines (P <
.01) (Fig. 3A) and in TLR4-positive/MyD88-positive primary MCL cells (P < .01) (Fig. 3B, Patient 1), but not in

TCCM, because the addition of LPS to control medium
did not inhibit T-cell proliferation (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, although TCCM from unstimulated wild-type or
TLR4-knockdown MCL cells displayed similar inhibitory activities, TCCM from LPS-stimulated TLR4knockdown MCL cells had a much weaker inhibitory
effect on T-cell proliferation compared with TCCM
from LPS-stimulated wild-type or control cells (P <
.05) (Fig. 5A). These results further confirmed that LPS
contamination in TCCM was not responsible for inhibited T-cell proliferation. Collectively, these findings
indicated that the suppression of T-cell proliferation was
induced by soluble factors in TCCM of unstimulated
MCL cells and LPS-stimulated MCL cells dependent on
788

TLR4 and MyD88 signaling. Because we demonstrated
that MCL cells secreted IL-6, IL-10, and VEGF and
that LPS up-regulated their secretion through TLR4 on
MCL cells, neutralizing antibodies against these cytokines were used. Figure 5D indicates that neutralizing
IL-10 or VEGF partially reversed the inhibition of Tcell proliferation by LPS-stimulated TCCM. Furthermore, the combination of both antibodies to neutralize
IL-10 and VEGF further reduced the inhibition of Tcell proliferation by LPS-stimulated TCCM. IL-6 had
no effect on the inhibition of T-cell proliferation,
because the addition of IL-6â€“neutralizing antibodies to
LPS-stimulated TCCM did not increase T-cell proliferation (data not shown). These findings indicated that

(200 ng/mL) for 24 hours before the assay. An effector-to-target ratio of 10:1 was used. A single asterisk indicates P < .05; double asterisks, P < .01.

MCL cells inhibited T-cell response by secreting the
cytokines, and LPS-stimulated MCL cells had a stronger
inhibitory effect on T-cell response.
Next, we explored whether the activation of MCL
TLR4 affected the sensitivity of cells to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) attack. MCL-reactive allogeneic T-cell
lines were generated by coculturing CD3-positive T cells
with irradiated wild-type or primary MCL cells and were
assayed for their cytolytic activity against their target cells.
The killing of LPS-stimulated (wild-type or vector control) MCL cells was inhibited significantly compared with
that of unstimulated MCL cells (P < .01), as illustrated in
Figure 6A; however, the killing of LPS-stimulated or
unstimulated TLR4-knockdown MCL cells was not different. Similarly, LPS-stimulated, TLR4-positive/
MyD88-positive primary MCL cells, but not TLR4-positive/MyD88-negative primary MCL cells, were more resistant to the killing by T cells (P < .01 compared with
unstimulated cells) (Fig. 6B). Neutralizing antibodies
against IL-10, or VEGF, or a combination of both could
partially reverse LPS-induced inhibition of the killing of
MCL cells by T cells (from P < .05 to P < .01 compared
with LPS-stimulated and control immunoglobulin Gtreated cells), as illustrated in Figure 6C. These results
indicated that LPS-stimulated MCL cells were less sensitive to the killing of tumor-reactive CTLs.
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates that TLR4 expressed on
MCL cells may contribute to tumor progression. We
demonstrated that MCL cells expressed multiple TLRs,

used the LPS ligand of TLR4 to explore the activity of
TLR4 signaling in MCL cells. Our results indicate that
the activation of TLR4 by LPS in MCL cells induces proliferation in MCL cell lines and in TLR4-positive/
MyD88-positive primary MCL cells, but not in TLR4positive/MyD88-negative primary MCL cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TLR4 in MCL cells retarded LPSinduced tumor cell growth.
In the tumor microenvironment, tumor-derived factors, including IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, and TGF-b, may bias
the induction of immune response and lead to a state of
tolerance against tumors.21 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the immune-modulatory enzyme IDO is an
important mediator of immune evasion.22 It also has been
reported that IL-18, a new member of the IL-1 cytokine
super family, plays an important role in immune
responses.23 In our study, MCL cells produced IL-6, IL10, and VEGF; and the activation of TLR4 signaling in
MCL cells up-regulated the secretion of these cytokines.
However, IDO, TGF-b, or IL-18 secretion was not
detected in MCL supernatants, and LPS stimulation
could not induce their secretion. These cytokines may
contribute to the inhibition of T-cell response induced by
LPS-pretreated MCL cells.
Because the current findings suggested that TLR4
ligand LPS may facilitate MCL cell evasion of the immune
surveillance, we also examined the effects of LPS-pretreated MCL cells in T-cell proliferation and CTL function. The results indicated that T-cell proliferation
induced by anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies was inhibited
in TCCM of unstimulated MCL cells and more so in
TCCM of LPS-stimulated MCL cells. Furthermore, LPS789

pretreated MCL cells were more resistant than untreated
cells to CTL-mediated killing. Neutralizing antibodies
against IL-10 and/or VEGF could partially restore T-cell
proliferation or CTL cytolytic activity. Similarly, knocking
down TLR4 on MCL cells could also partially restore their
sensitivity to CTLs. The inhibition of T-cell proliferation
and CTL function by LPS-stimulated MCL cells also was
observed in TLR4-positive/MyD88-positive primary
MCL cells, but not in TLR4-positive/MyD88-negative
primary MCL cells. Taken together, these findings suggest
that TLR4 ligand activation may facilitate MCL cell evasion of immune surveillance, which is MyD88-dependent.
Recent studies have indicated that TLRs play a role
in carcinogenesis, but different TLRs may play different
roles, having either antitumor or protumor activities.24,25
Similar to our findings in MCL, He et al demonstrated
that TLR4 signaling promoted immune escape of human
lung cancers,26 and Szajnik et al demonstrated that TLR4
signaling induced by LPS or paclitaxel supported ovarian
cancer progression and chemoresistance.15 However,
Nunez et al reported that TLR4-activated tumor cells produced interferon-b and enhanced induction of the antitumor immune response.27 The discrepancy between these
observations is not obvious but may be attributed to tumor heterogeneity and the secretion of immunosuppressive (IL-10 and VEGF) or proimmune (interferon-b)
cytokines upon TLR4 signaling in the tumors.
In conclusion, our current results indicate that MCL
cells express TLRs and that recurrent bacterial infections
in patients may activate MCL-associated TLR4 through
LPS, which promotes tumor growth and shields MCL
cells from immune surveillance. Therefore, TLR4 signaling molecules may be novel therapeutic targets for cancer
therapy in patients with MCL. It is noteworthy that targeting TLR4 signaling through the TLR4 Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-derived decoy peptides has been
developed.28 Sheedy et al demonstrated that targeting of
the proinflammatory tumor suppressor PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) by microRNA-21 may negatively
regulate TLR4.29 Lysakova-Devine et al demonstrated
that a viral inhibitory peptide of TLR4 specifically inhibited TLR4 by directly targeting MyD88 adaptor-like and
TIR-domainâ€“containing, adapter-inducing interferon-b
(TRIF)-related adaptor molecules.30 Tang et al also identified negative regulation of TLR4 through targeting of
the key adaptor molecule MyD88 by microRNA-155.31
