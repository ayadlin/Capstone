ABSTRACT
Melanoma is a recalcitrant disease in need of transformative therapuetics.
The present study used a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) nudemouse model of melanoma with a BRAF-V600E mutation to determine the efficacy
of temozolomide (TEM) combined with tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium
A1-R. A melanoma obtained from the right chest wall of a patient was grown
orthotopically in the right chest wall of nude mice to establish a PDOX model. Two
weeks after implantation, 40 PDOX nude mice were divided into 4 groups: G1,
control without treatment (n = 10); G2, TEM (25 mg/kg, administrated orally daily
for 14 consecutive days, n = 10); G3, S. typhimurium A1-R (5 × 107 CFU/100 μl,
i.v., once a week for 2 weeks, n = 10); G4, TEM combined with S. typhimurium
A1-R (25 mg/kg, administrated orally daily for 14 consecutive days and 5 × 107
CFU/100 μl, i.v., once a week for 2 weeks, respectively, n = 10). Tumor sizes were
measured with calipers twice a week. On day 14 from initiation of treatment, all
treatments significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to untreated control (TEM:
p < 0.0001; S. typhimurium A1-R: p < 0.0001; TEM combined with S. typhimurium
A1-R: p < 0.0001). TEM combined with S. typhimurium A1-R was significantly
more effective than either S. typhimurium A1-R (p = 0.0004) alone or TEM alone
(p = 0.0017). TEM combined with S. typhimurium A1-R could regress the melanoma
in the PDOX model and has important future clinical potential for melanoma patients.

INTRODUCTION

a first-line chemotherapy for melanoma but with limited
efficacy [1–5]. Although recently-developed immunotherapy has extended survival to some extent, the 5-year
survival rate has not significantly increased [1–5]. There
is still no cure for stage III and IV melanoma due to drug
resistance, tumor heterogeneity and an immune-suppressed
tumor microenvironment [5]. Therefore, more effective
approaches to melanoma treatment are needed.

Melanoma becomes a recalcitrant cancer when
it metastasizes to regional lymph nodes, with a 5-year
survival rate of 29% and 7% when it metastasizes to organs
[1]. Dacarbazine and cisplatinum have been used to treat
melanoma with limited efficacy [1–5]. Temozolomide
(TEM) is an alkylating agent, had been widely used as

Clinically-relevant mouse models of melanoma
could permit evaluation of tailor-made therapy based
on the patient-derived tumor. Our laboratory pioneered
the patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) nude
mouse model with the technique of surgical orthotopic
implantation (SOI), including pancreatic [6–9], breast
[10], ovarian [11], lung [12], cervical [13], colon [14–16],
stomach [17], sarcoma [18–22], and melanoma [23].
The tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R
(S. typhimurium A1-R), developed by our laboratory
[24], is auxotrophic for Leu-Arg, which prevents it from
mounting a continuous infection in normal tissues. S.
typhimurium A1-R was effective against primary and
metastatic tumors as monotherapy in nude mouse models
of major cancers including prostate [25, 26], breast
[27– 29], lung [30, 31], pancreatic [8, 32–35], ovarian
[36, 37] stomach [38], and cervical cancer [39], as well
as sarcoma cell lines [40–42] and glioma [43, 44], all of
which are highly aggressive tumor models. In addition, S.
typhimurium A1-R was effective against patient-derived
orthotopic models of pancreatic cancer [8, 35], sarcoma
[20–22] and melanoma [23].
In a previous study, we used the PDOX model of
melanoma to test sensitivity to three molecularly-targeted
drugs and one standard chemotherapeutic. A melanoma
with a BRAF-V600E mutation was resected from the
right chest wall of a patient. The melanoma was grown
orthotopically in the right chest wall of nude mice to
establish a PDOX model. Trametinib (TRA), a MEK
inhibitor caused tumor regression. In contrast, another
MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib (COB), slowed but did not
arrest growth or cause regression of the melanoma. TEM
could slow but not arrest tumor growth or cause regression.
Vemrafenib (VEM), which targets the BRAF-V600E
mutation would be considered to be a strong candidate for
VEM as first-line therapy, was not effective. These results
demonstrated the powerful precision of the PDOX model
for cancer therapy, not achievable by genomic analysis
alone [45].
The combination of S. typhimurium A1-R and
cisplatinum (CDDP), both at low-dose, also significantly
suppressed the growth of another melanoma PDOX with
less side effects than high-dose CDDP monotherapy [23].
In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of S.
typhimurium A1-R alone and in combination with TEM
on a PDOX model for melanoma with the BRAF-V600E
mutation.

A1-R (p = 0.0004) and TEM alone (p = 0.0017) and
regressed the tumor. There was no significant difference
between the efficacy of S. typhimurium A1-R and TEM
on the melanoma PDOX (p = 0.5205) (Figures 1, 2). The
relative body weight on day 14 compared with day 0 did
not significantly differ between each treatment group
(Figure 3).
Confocal microscopy showed that the S.
typhimurium A1-R could directly target the melanoma
PDOX (Figure 4) and cause tumor necrosis (Figure 5).
The histology of the original patient tumor and the
untreated PDOX tumor were similar, containing the same
types of cells. However, nests of cancer cells were seen
in the original, but not in the PDOX. Also, the original
tumor was slightly melanotic, but the PDOX tumor did not
appear to contain melanin [45].
TEM, an alkylating agent, had been widely used
as a standard chemotherapy for melanoma. Currently,
several molecular targeting agents or immunotherapy are
often the first line for melanoma treatment. However, not
all melanomas have mutations that are targeted by these
new agents and not all patients with these mutations are
responsive to these drugs [1].
We previously showed with the present melanoma
PDOX that TRA, a MEK inhibitor, was very active and
could arrest this tumor, but that COB, another MEK
inhibitor, could not arrest the melanoma PDOX. In addition,
we showed the VEM was inactive against this melanoma
PDOX [45], even though it targets the BRAF-V600E
mutation in this melanoma [46].
Despite progress in melanoma therapy, there is still
no cure for stage III and IV disease due to drug resistance,
tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment [1–5]. In addition, the presence of
melanin appears to interfere with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy of this recalcitrant disease [3]. The present
results demonstrate the potential of S. typhimurium A1-R
to significantly increase the efficacy of first-line melanoma
therapy, TEM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Athymic nu/nu nude mice (AntiCancer Inc., San
Diego, CA), 4–6 weeks old, were used in this study.
All mouse surgical procedures and imaging were
performed with the animals anesthetized by subcutaneous
injection of a ketamine mixture (0.02 ml solution of
20 mg/kg ketamine, 15.2 mg/kg xylazine, and 0.48 mg/kg
acepromazine maleate). The response of animals during
surgery was monitored to ensure adequate depth of
anesthesia. The animals were observed on a daily basis
and humanely sacrificed by CO2 inhalation if they met the
following humane endpoint criteria: severe tumor burden
(more than 20 mm in diameter), prostration, significant

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
All treatments significantly inhibited tumor growth
compared to untreated control (TEM: p < 0.0001;
S. typhimurium A1-R: p < 0.0001; TEM combined
with S. typhimurium A1-R: p < 0.0001) on day 14 after
initiation. TEM combined with S. typhimurium A1-R was
significantly more effective than both S. typhimurium

of 5 × 107 CFU S. typhimurium A1-R in 100 μl PBS was
administered to each mouse [25–27].

Patient-derived tumor

Treatment study design in the PDOX model of
melanoma

A 75-year-old female patient diagnosed with a
melanoma of the right chest wall. The tumor was resected
in the Department of Surgery, University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA). Written informed consent was
provided by the patient, and the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) of UCLA approved this experiment [45].

PDOX mouse models were randomized into four
groups of 10 mice each: untreated control (n = 10);
treated with TEM (25 mg/kg, administrated orally
daily for 14 consecutive days, n = 10) [1]; treated with
S. typhimurium A1-R (5 × 107 CFU/100 μl, i.v., once a
week for 2 weeks, n = 10); treated with TEM (25 mg/kg,
administrated orally daily for 14 consecutive days)
combined with S. typhimurium A1-R (5 × 107 CFU/100 μl,
i.v., once a week for 2 weeks, n = 10). Tumor length and
width were measured twice a week. Tumor volume was
calculated with the following formula: Tumor volume
(mm3) = length (mm) × width (mm) × width (mm) × 1/2.
Data are presented as mean ± SD. The tumor volume ratio
is defined at the tumor volume at any given time point
relative to the initial tumor volume.

Establishment of PDOX models of melanoma by
surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI)
A fresh sample of the melanoma of the patient was
obtained and transported immediately to the laboratory
at AntiCancer, Inc., on wet ice. The sample was cut
into 5-mm fragments and implanted subcutaneously
in nude mice. After three weeks, the subcutaneouslyimplanted tumors grew to more than 10 mm in diameter.
The subcutaneously-grown tumors were then harvested
and cut into small fragments (3 mm3). After nude mice
were anesthetized with the ketamine solution described
above, a 5-mm skin incision was made on the right chest
into the chest wall, which was split to make space for
the melanoma tissue fragment. A single tumor fragment
was implanted orthotopically into the space to establish
the PDOX model. The wound was closed with a 6–0
nylon suture (Ethilon, Ethicon, Inc., NJ, USA) [45].

Confocal microscopy
The FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan) was used for high-resolution imaging. Fluorescence
images were obtained using the 20×/0.50 UPlan FLN and
40×/1.3 oil Olympus UPLAN FLN objectives [47].

Histological examination

Preparation and administration of
S. typhimurium A1-R

Fresh tumor samples were ﬁxed in 10% formalin
and embedded in parafﬁn before sectioning and staining.
Tissue sections (5 μm) were deparafﬁnized in xylene and
rehydrated in an ethanol series. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining was performed according to standard
protocols. Histological examination was performed with a
BHS System Microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). Images were acquired with INFINITY ANALYZE
software (Lumenera Corporation, Ottawa, Canada) [20].

GFP-expressing S. typhimurium A1-R bacteria
(AntiCancer Inc.,) were grown overnight on LB medium
(Fisher Sci., Hanover Park, IL, USA) and then diluted
1:10 in LB medium. Bacteria were harvested at late-log
phase, washed with PBS, and then diluted in PBS. S.
typhimurium A1-R was injected intravenously. A total

Statistical analysis
JMP version 11.0 was used for all statistical
analyses. Significant differences for continuous variables
were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Line
graphs expressed average values and error bar showed SD.
A probability value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

CONCLUSIONS
The combination of TEM and S. typhimurium A1-R
was more effective than each mono-therapy for melanoma
in a PDOX mouse model and could regress the tumor. This
treatment strategy has important future clinical application,
which possibly can be realized in the near future.
Previously-developed concepts and strategies of
highly-selective tumor targeting can take advantage of
molecular targeting of tumors, including tissue-selective
therapy which focuses on unique differences between
normal and tumor tissues [48–53].
