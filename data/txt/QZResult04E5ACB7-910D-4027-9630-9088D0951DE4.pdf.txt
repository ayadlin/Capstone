The epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of tyrosine kinase
receptors consists of four receptors (EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and
ErbB4) and more than a dozen ligands (2, 3). Ligand binding to the
extracellular domain of the receptor results in the activation of
the receptor (4). The activated receptor can dimerize with other
EGFRs followed by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the
receptors (5).
EGFR is one of the most frequently overexpressed proteins in
various cancers including lung cancer, and signaling through this
receptor has been known to cause tumor progression as well as
resistance to different treatments (6–8). Therefore, EGFR has
become an attractive target for various treatment strategies. The
two most commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR
are gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774).
Erlotinib and gefitinib are tailored drugs that compete with ATP
for the ATP-binding site on the EGFR and thereby prevent
phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling molecules
involved in cell proliferation and tumor growth. Gefitinib was the
first oral EGFR inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, various trials using
gefitinib showed that this drug did not significantly prolong
survival in the overall study population (9).
In contrast to gefitinib, erlotinib has shown antitumor activity in
patients with advanced NSCLC who have failed all prior treatment
regimens (10). Erlotinib was also superior to placebo with respect
to progression-free survival and objective response rate (11).
However, overall response rates have been relatively disappointing
(10–15%) in studies that examine all NSCLC patients collectively
(12). It is a possibility that not all patients with lung cancer are
suitable for erlotinib treatment, and that patients should be
selected for this treatment. Various variables have been suggested
in order to identify the patients that respond to erlotinib such as
type of the tumor, smoking history, gender, and ethnicity (13, 14).
Despite this, response rates are not as promising as expected.
Expression and mutation status of the EGFR has also been used to
predict response, and it has been reported that patients expressing
high amounts of the EGFR show better response to erlotinib (12).
Furthermore, the presence of specific mutations centered around
the ATP binding domain of the receptor has been shown to
significantly increase the response to gefitinib treatment in
patients with lung cancer (15, 16).
However, analysis of the expression of EGFR and the presence of
mutations requires a tumor biopsy, which is not possible to get in
all situations. Thus, there is a need to develop noninvasive methods
that can identify the subset of patients which are most likely to
benefit from erlotinib treatment.
The first prerequisite for a tailored drug to be effective is the
binding of the drug with its target. This depends on two major

Abstract
Erlotinib (Tarceva) targets the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), which is commonly overexpressed in human
cancers, including lung cancer. We show that erlotinib can be
labeled with [11C] by reacting the normethyl precursor with
[11C]-methyl iodide. By using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay, two lung
cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI358) were shown to be less
sensitive to erlotinib compared with the lung cancer cell line
HCC827. This correlated with higher expression and activity of
the EGFR in HCC827 cells as compared with the less sensitive
cell lines. Micro–positron emission tomography (PET) and
biodistribution of erlotinib was performed with [11C]-erlotinib
in nude mice bearing xenografts of A549, NCI358, and HCC827
cells. Dynamic micro-PET showed that HCC827 tumors had
the highest [11C]-erlotinib uptake and retained the activity
significantly longer as compared with A549 and NCI358
tumors. Biodistribution of [11C]-erlotinib in the xenograft
models of lung cancer showed the highest accumulation in the
liver. In mice carrying the sensitive cancer cells, the
accumulation of [11C]-erlotinib was higher in tumors than in
the other organs. In contrast, the drug accumulated to a
comparable extent in tumors from the less sensitive cancer
cells and the other organs. Uptake of [11C]-erlotinib in the
tumors was 1.6%, 0.7%, and 3.7% (percentage of injected
dose/g), in A549, NCI358, and HCC827 cells, respectively. We
show for the first time that [11C]-erlotinib identifies erlotinibsensitive tumors. These results pave the road for studies
examining the benefit of [11C]-erlotinib PET in patients with
lung tumors or other tumors overexpressing EGFR. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of all cancer deaths (1),
but despite much effort, it is still difficult to predict the response
and clinical outcome of the disease. Various treatment strategies,
such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have been used
for the treatment of patients with lung cancer. In recent years, new
treatment strategies targeting the epidermal growth factor
receptors (EGFR) have been developed.

96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega), a colorimetric
method for determining the number of viable cells. Experiments were

factors (a) the presence of the target in the tumor and (b) delivery
of the drug to the target. Hence, it is important to examine these
factors for the selection of patients best-suited for tailored drugs.
Unfortunately, traditional methods of studying kinetics of drugtarget interaction are laborious and are not always possible with
the clinical material available. Positron emission tomography (PET)
has been used to follow the tumor response indirectly by measuring the metabolic activity using [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose in
the tumors (17–19). The major challenge with this method is that
the high metabolic activity can also be found in other situations
such as inflammation, which can produce false-positive results (20).
Other strategies such as labeled peptides and antibodies as
radiotracers for PET have been used for the diagnosis of the
disease or prediction of the response. However, due to the relatively
large size and unfavorable receptor binding kinetics compared with
systemic clearance of the drug, imaging with these molecules has
been hampered (21, 22).
The smaller size and faster systemic clearance of tailored drugs
provides a unique opportunity to examine the interaction between
the drug and its target EGFR in vivo. It has also been shown that
labeling of gefitinib with [11C] was possible (23). Therefore, PET
imaging with labeled erlotinib may prove to be a useful noninvasive
method to screen patients who will respond to erlotinib treatment.
In this study, we have labeled erlotinib with [11C] and have
evaluated it as a potential radiotracer for the identification of
tumors in mice carrying either sensitive or less sensitive xenografts.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. Human lung cancer cell lines, A549, NCI358,
and HCC827 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
The HCC827 has a high expression of the EGFR and harbors an in-frame
deletion mutation (delE746-A750) in exon 19 (24). Cells were grown in
DMEM cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 (v/v). Erlotinib
hydrochloride and its precursor were provided by OSI Pharmaceuticals.
Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described before
(25). Briefly, lung cancer cells were cultured and harvested at f80% to
90% confluence, the cell pellet was disrupted on ice for 30 min in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and cleared by centrifugation as
described by Schooler and Wiley (26). Protein concentration was
determined with a bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce Chemical). Equal
amounts of protein (25 Ag) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resolved
proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and
blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST solution. The blots were
incubated with specific primary and secondary antibodies according to the
data sheet provided by the manufacturers. Immunoreactive bands were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody used for Western blotting analysis were p-EGFR (Tyr1173,

sodium dihydrogenphosphate) before injection onto a semi-prep HPLC
column (Waters XTerra 5my C18 ODB, 150  19 mm) with online UV
detection (280 nm) and radiodetection. The fraction corresponding to
[O -methyl-11C]-erlotinib was collected and transferred to a rotary
evaporator, where it was evaporated to near-dryness (100jC under vacuum).
The product was reformulated in sterile saline (9 mL) and 100% sterile
ethanol (1 mL) and passed through a sterile 0.22 Am filter into a sterile vial.
Analytical HPLC (Phenomenex Synergi FUSION 4 Am RP-80, 250  4.6 mm,
50% acetonitrile, 50% 70 mmol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate) showed
the product to have <95% radiochemical purity and to have a specific
activity in the range of 20 to 100 GBq/Amol.
Lung cancer xenografts and in vivo biodistribution studies with
[11C]-erlotinib. The animal experiments were approved by the Danish
Animal Experiments Inspectorate. Female BALB/cA nude mice (C.Cg/
AnBomTac-Foxnnu; Taconic, Ltd.), approximately 8 weeks old, were used for
the study. The mice were housed in plastic cages (Tecniplast) under
pathogen-free conditions with a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule and fed
standard chow (Altromin no. 1324) and water ad libitum.
Lung cancer cells were harvested in log phase and were inoculated in
the left shoulder subcutaneously. Twenty million cells from each cell line
in 200 AL ice-cold PBS were injected per site per animal using a 27gauge 1/2 mL syringe. By 4 to 5 weeks, tumors were growing
exponentially and were f1 cm in diameter. Xenografts were randomly
selected for biodistribution and 15 to 20 MBq of [11C]-erlotinib were
injected in each animal model (A549, n = 3; NCI358, n = 3; and HCC827,
n = 2) via the lateral tail vein. One hour after injection, animals were
sacrificed and the major organs, tumors and blood were weighed and
analyzed by a Packard Cobra II g-counter (Canberra) and the percentage
of injected dose per organ per gram (% DPG) were calculated from the
tissue count.
Micro-PET imaging with [11C]-erlotinib in lung cancer xenografts.
Dynamic micro-PET imaging was performed on lung cancer xenografts for
90 min using a Concorde R4 micro-PET scanner with spatial resolution of
2 mm (Concorde Microsystems). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane
and placed in a polyvinyl chloride tube cut in half longitudinally. Mouse and
holder were then positioned in the cavity of the micro-PET scanner. Mice
were injected with 10 to 15 MBq of [11C]-erlotinib via the lateral tail vein.
Immediately after injection, mice underwent scanning for 90 min while
being kept sedated with 1.5% to 2% isoflurane. Body temperature was
maintained by a feedback-regulated light bulb connected to a rectal
thermo-probe. The frame duration was defined as 8  15, 4  30, 2  60,
2  120, 4  300 and 6  600 s frames. Images were reconstructed from raw
data by Fourier rebinning and two-dimensional filtered back projection,
resulting in 63 transverse and 128 coronal and sagittal sections with a
thickness of 1.2, 0.85, and 0.85 mm, respectively. The images were
reconstructed with three-dimensional filtered back projection with a ramp
filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.5 pixels 1. No post-filtering or smoothing
of the images was performed during or after reconstruction. The PET
images were analyzed with the Acquisition Sinogram and Image Processing
software that accompanies the Concorde micro-PET. Regions of interest
were manually drawn by creating a volume of interest in the central area of
the tumor and a reference area. A time-activity curve was plotted for the
tumor and the reference area.

Results
Erlotinib sensitivity to lung cancer cell lines related to the
expression of EGFR. We analyzed three lung cancer cell lines for
their sensitivity to erlotinib. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay showed a significant decrease in the proliferation of HCC827 cells by erlotinib
treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the A549 and
NCI358 cells were less sensitive to erlotinib treatment as
concentrations of erlotinib up to 6 Amol/L did not result in a
significant decrease in proliferation (Fig. 2A). All cell lines were
cultured in replicates of five wells and experiments were repeated

(3,000 cells), and NCI358 and HCC827 (5,000 cells). Twenty-four hours after
seeding, cells were treated with 0.5 to 6 Amol/L erlotinib or with vehicle for
48 h.
Labeling of erlotinib. Synthesis of [11C]-erlotinib (Fig. 1) was
accomplished by reacting 6-O-desmethyl-erlotinib (OSI 420) with [11C]methyl iodide in dimethyl formamide for 5 min at 120jC, using NaH as the
supporting base. The reaction mixture was diluted with high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) eluent (46% ethanol, 54% 70 mmol/L

at least thrice. The data is presented as the percentage of control
cells (cells treated with vehicle).
Analysis of EGFR expression by Western blotting showed a high
expression of active (phosphorylated) and total EGFR in the
sensitive HCC827 cells as compared with the less sensitive A549
and NCI358 cells (Fig. 2B).
Micro-PET imaging with [11C]-erlotinib in lung cancer
xenografts. Dynamic micro-PET imaging was performed on each
tumor model for 90 min after tracer injection (Fig. 3). Tumor is
marked by an arrow and a high level of uptake was seen in
HCC827 xenografts (Fig. 3C), whereas no significant uptake was
observed in the A549 and NCI358 xenografts (Fig. 3A and B,
respectively). Furthermore, time-activity curves for tumor and
reference area showed that only in the HCC827 xenograft was
the activity higher in the tumor than in the reference area
throughout the measurement period of 90 min (Fig. 3F). The
activity was also sustained for a longer time in the HCC827
tumors as compared with the A549 and NCI358 tumors (Fig. 3D
and E, respectively).
In vivo biodistribution of [11C]-erlotinib in xenografts.
Biodistribution studies were performed 1 h after injection in xeno-

grafts bearing A549 (n = 3), NCI358 (n = 3), and HCC827 (n = 2)
lung cancer cells. In all xenograft models, the liver took up the
highest amount of activity. In mice xenografts with HCC827 cells,
the activity in the tumor was higher than in the other organs
measured (apart from the liver), whereas this was not observed
when the mice were xenografted with A549 and NCI358 cells
(Fig. 4). Tumor accumulation was calculated as 1.62% (F0.47%),
0.69% (F0.11%), and 3.66% (F0.14%) of the injected dose per gram
in A549, NCI358, and HCC827 cells, respectively. Table 1 shows the
biodistribution of [11C]-erlotinib in all major tissues and all
tumors examined in this study. Comparison of the accumulation
of [11C]-erlotinib in tumors show a significantly higher activity in
HCC827 compared with A549 (P < 0.05) or NCI358 (P < 0.005),
whereas no significant (P > 0.05) difference was observed in the
accumulation of activity between A549 and NCI358 (Fig. 5).

Discussion
The data presented in this study show for the first time the
feasibility of labeling erlotinib and using [11C]-erlotinib as a

Identification of Lung Tumors by [11C]-Labeled Erlotinib

radiotracer. Our results show that [11C]-erlotinib can be used to
identify erlotinib-sensitive tumors.
Three human lung cancer cell lines expressing low (A549 and
NCI358) and high (HCC827) EGFR were selected for this study.
A549 and HCC827 have been characterized as less sensitive and
sensitive cell lines, respectively, to treatment with gefitinib (27),
which is another EGFR inhibitor with a similar mechanism of
action as erlotinib. In agreement with the data on gefitinib
sensitivity, a significant decrease in proliferation of HCC827 cells
was observed in a dose-dependent manner, whereas A549 was less
sensitive to erlotinib treatment and so was the NCI358 cell line.
To evaluate the efficiency of [11C]-erlotinib as a radiotracer,
micro-PET scanning on xenografts bearing A549, NCI358, and
HCC827 lung cancer cells was performed. This showed that
xenografts from the erlotinib-sensitive HCC827 cells could be
visualized by micro-PET scanning, whereas xenografts from A549
and NCI358 cells could not. This result was confirmed by
biodistribution analysis that showed a higher uptake of [11C]erlotinib in HCC827 cells as compared with the A549 and NCI358
cells. It is important to note that HCC827 cells have both a high
expression of EGFR and also harbor an in-frame deletion mutation
(delE746-A750) in exon 19. The presence of this mutation is
believed to further increase the sensitivity of the HCC827 cells to
erlotinib treatment (24), although the exact mechanism of this
increased sensitivity is not fully known. Interestingly, our results
obtained from the time-activity curves showed a sustained activity
in HCC827 tumors compared with the reference area. It is therefore
possible that the presence of this sensitizing mutation might
increase the binding of the drug with its target and thereby more
efficiently inhibit signaling through EGFR. However, from our data,
we cannot conclude whether it is the elevated expression or the
mutation that causes the accumulation of erlotinib in the tumor.
Nevertheless, our data show that [11C]-erlotinib accumulates in the
tumor that responds to erlotinib treatment.
For biodistribution studies, activity was analyzed in the major
organs 1 hour after [11C]-erlotinib injection. As expected, the liver
showed the highest uptake of the drug as it is the major organ of
erlotinib metabolism (28). Interestingly, very little or no activity was
measured in the brain. The result is in agreement with previous
data indicating that the normal brain expresses low EGFR (29).
Therefore, low uptake of [11C]-erlotinib in the brain offers
considerable promise for this radiotracer in identifying primary
or metastatic brain tumors expressing the EGFR with minimal
background. Such tumors have previously been shown to respond
to erlotinib (30, 31) and it is therefore very likely that the tumors
accumulate the drug.

In conclusion, we have developed a method for radiosynthesis of
[11C]-erlotinib and evaluated it as a new radiotracer for the
identification of tumors sensitive to erlotinib treatment. Our results
suggest that [11C]-erlotinib can be used as a noninvasive and rapid
method for the identification of erlotinib-responding tumors.
