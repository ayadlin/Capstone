ABSTRACT
The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has emerged as an
important target for cancer treatment. HDN-1, an epipolythiopiperazine-2, 5-diones
(ETPs) compound, was here identified as a new Hsp90 inhibitor. HDN-1 bound directly
to C-terminus of Hsp90α, resulting in a potential conformational change that interfered
with the binding of 17-AAG and novobiocin to Hsp90α. In contrast, association of
17-AAG, novobiocin or ATP with Hsp90α did not prevent the binding HDN-1 to Hsp90α.
HDN-1 in combination with 17-AAG exhibited an enhanced inhibitory effect on nonsmall lung cancer cell proliferation. Molecular docking analyses revealed that HDN-1
bound to Hsp90α at C-terminal 526–570 region. In addition, HDN-1 degraded multiple
oncoproteins and promoted EGF-induced wild type and mutated EGFR downregulation.
Notably, chaetocin, used as a SUV39H1 inhibitor with similar structure to HDN-1,
bound to Hsp90 and degraded Hsp90 client proteins and SUV39H1 as did HDN-1.
These results indicate that HDN-1 and chaetocin are inhibitors of Hsp90 and that
SUV39H1 is a novel client protein of Hsp90.

and degradation and activating them. These oncoproteins
include EGFR, Akt, cyclinD1, BCR-ABL, ERB-B2, CRAF,
BRAF, MET, VEGFR, FLT3, androgen and estrogen
receptors, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α [5, 6].
Inhibition of Hsp90 induces apoptosis through inhibition
of the multiple growth signalings [7], and Hsp90 has been
recognized as a crucial facilitator of oncogene addiction and
cancer cell survival and has emerged as an important target
in cancer therapeutics [8, 9].
Hsp90 forms a homodimer and each monomer
contains three flexibly linked regions, an N-terminal
domain (1–275 aa), middle domain (275–444 aa), and
a C-terminal domain (444–677 aa) [10, 11]. N-terminal
domain binds to ATP, co-chaperones, and potentially
client proteins. Middle domain, which contains a
catalytic arginine required for the ATPase activity,
binds to co-chaperones and is thought to be the major

INTRODUCTION
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an evolutionarily
conserved molecular chaperone. Human Hsp90 has four
human isoforms. The two cytosolic isoforms in mammalian
cells include the major, inducible Hsp90α and the minor,
constitutively expressed, Hsp90β [1]. Hsp90 participates in
stabilizing and activating more than 200 proteins, referred
to as Hsp90 ‘clients’. Many of Hsp90 client proteins are
essential for cell signaling and adaptive responses to stress
[2, 3]. Importantly, some Hsp90 clients are bona fide
oncoproteins, linked to all six hallmarks of cancer as defined
by Hanahan and Weinberg, and inhibitor of Hsp90 was
seemed to be able to simultaneously affect all six hallmarks
of cancer [4]. Hsp90 is frequently upregulated in many solid
tumors and hematological malignancies, protecting an array
of mutated and overexpressed oncoproteins from misfolding

client-protein binding domain. C-terminal domain
contains a second ATP-binding site and the major
dimerization interface, which makes Hsp90 a constitutive
dimer. The C-terminus is a highly conserved MEEVD
motif, which binds to TPR-containing co-chaperones
[2]. Early attempts of drug development concentrated
on blocking ATP binding at the N-terminal domain of
Hsp90. Two natural products, geldanamycin (GA) and
radiciol, and other synthetic small-molecule inhibitors,
such as 17-AAG, IPI-504, KF58333, AUY922A,
BIIB021, and SNX2112, have been shown to possess
anti-proliferative activity and target the ATP-binding
site in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90. Up to now,
13 Hsp90 inhibitors representing multiple drug classes
are undergoing clinical evaluation, and many more
compounds are in pre-clinical development [9]. However,
human clinical trials involving these Hsp90 N-terminal
inhibitors revealed that most of these inhibitors exhibit
unfavorable toxicity profiles and tendency to induce
expression of cytoprotective Hsp70 proteins [5, 12].
Because of the growing understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the function of Hsp90 in malignant
transformation, C-terminal/middle domains of Hsp90
inhibitor, co-chaperone/Hsp90 interactions inhibitors,
client/Hsp90 associations, and cell surface Hsp90
inhibitors have now been under investigation [13, 14].
Epipolythiopiperazine-2, 5-diones (ETPs) constitute
an important class of biologically active compounds,
characterized by a bridged polysulfide piperazine ring.
HDN-1 (Figure 1) is a novel ETPs obtained from the
antarctic fungus Oidiodendron truncatum GW3–13,
which was isolated from the soil under lichens near to the
Great Wall station (Chinese Antarctic station). HDN- 1
has significant cytotoxic activities against various human
cancer cell lines [15]. Our preliminary studies revealed
that HDN-1 simultaneously inhibited various proteins
expression, which suggested that HDN-1 is a new
Hsp90 inhibitor. In the present study, we investigated the

relationship between HDN-1 and Hsp90, and examined
the effect of HDN-1 on Hsp90 regulation compared with
that exhibited by the N-terminal inhibitor 17-AAG and
C-terminal inhibitor novobiocin. Our results demonstrated
that HDN-1 is a novel C-terminal inhibitor of Hsp90. In
addition, we revealed that chaetocin functions as inhibitor
of Hsp90 and SUV39H1 is a new client protein of Hsp90.

RESULTS
HDN-1 binds to Hsp90α
To investigate whether HDN-1 directly binds to
Hsp90α, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
to determine the interaction between HDN-1 and
Hsp90α, which was biotinylated and immobilized onto a
streptavidin-coated sensor chip. As shown in Figure 2A,
typical sensorgrams of the interaction between HDN-1
and Hsp90α were obtained at 30, 15, 7.5 and 1.8 μM of
HDN-1. The dissociation constant (Kd values) of HDN-1
was 14.6 μM, indicating that HDN-1 binds to Hsp90α with
moderate affinity. To identify the binding site of HDN-1,
we injected 17-AAG, novobiocin or ATP over the chip
before or after HDN-1 inclusion. We found that HDN-1
was able to associate with Hsp90α that was pre-bounded
with 17-AAG (Figure 2B), novobiocin (Figure 2C) or ATP
(Figure 2D). In contrast, a pre-association of HDN-1 with
Hsp90α reduced the binding of Hsp90α to novobiocin
(Figure 2C) or ATP (Figure 2D). These results strongly
suggest that HDN-1 binds to Hsp90α in a manner different
from 17-AAG, novobiocin and ATP. The binding HDN-1 to
Hsp90α may alter Hsp90α conformation that prevents the
access of Hsp90α to 17-AAG, novobiocin and ATP.

HDN-1 binds to C-terminus of Hsp90α
To determine the region of Hsp90α that binds to
HND-1, we used competitive inhibition assay based

on fluorescence polarization. We found that N-terminal
Hsp90α inhibitor 17-AAG competed with GA to bind
to full-length Hsp90α (IC50; 0.298 μM) (Table 1). In
contrast, HDN-1 did not affect GA’s binding to Hsp90
even at 10 μM concentration. These results suggested
that HDN-1 and 17-AAG bind to different regions of
Hsp90α or the binding of HDN-1 to Hsp90α alters the
Hsp90α structure that prevents the binding of 17-AAG.
Given that the conformational changes of proteins
could lead to different proteolytic fingerprintings [14],
we performed proteolytic fingerprinting assay with
purified full-length Hsp90α proteins. Hsp90α protein
was incubated with 17-AAG or HDN-1 followed by
limited trypsin digestion, the fragments containing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the C-terminal domain of Hsp90α were detected by an
antibody specifically recognizing epitopes within the
C-terminus. As shown in Figure 3A, Hsp90α incubation
with HDN-1 generated a 50 kDa C-terminal fragment.
In contrast, this fragment was not detected after
17-AAG incubation. These results implicated that
HDN-1 interacts with the C-terminal domain of Hsp90α
and affects its degradation by trypsin.
The combination of C-terminal and N-terminal Hsp90
inhibitor may induce enhancing effects [16, 17]. We next
examined the effects of 17-AAG (100, 200, 300 nM) and
HDN-1 (100, 200 nM), either alone or in combination, on
growth inhibition of H1975 non-small cell lung cancer cells
by the MTT assay (The Q value was calculated according to

Jin’s formula [18]). As shown in Table 2, co-treatment with
17-AAG and HDN-1 greatly enhanced the cell proliferation
inhibition in a dosage-dependent manner compared to
the treatment with 17-AAG or HDN-1 alone (Q value
were greater than 0.85), suggesting that HDN-1 binds to
C-terminus of Hsp90. This finding was further supported
by SPR spectroscopy with recombinant C-terminal Hsp90
fragment (535–732aa) of human Hsp90α immobilized onto
chip. Figure 3B shows that HDN-1 was able to bind to
C-terminus of Hsp90α with the Kd value of 201 μM.
To predict the potential binding site of HDN-1,
we performed molecular docking analyses. As shown
in Figure 3C and 3D, HDN-1 was able to dock into
C-terminus of Hsp90α. The hydroxyl groups in the HDN-1
molecule formed two hydrogen bonds (< 3.0 Å) with
residues Glu529 and Lys564, and the rest of the molecule
were stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Lys526,
Phe528, Lys537, Arg540, Ile544, Tyr569, and Lys570.

These results suggest that HDN-1 binds to a novel site
different from the reported bind sites of Hsp90α N-terminal
and C-terminal inhibitors [14], and this novel binding site
is probably at 526–570 region of Hsp90α (Figure 3E).

HDN-1 induces degradation of multiple
oncoproteins
We first tested the growth inhibitory effect of HDN-1
on three non-small cell lung cancer cell lines H1975,
HCC827 and A549. HDN-1 inhibited the proliferation
of these cancer cell lines with an IC50 of 0.22, 0.54, and
1.06 μM, respectively (Table 3). We showed that H1975
cells, which contain T790M mutation were resistant to
conventional EGFR inhibitors, were sensitive to HDN-1
treatment. The Hsp90 chaperone complex regulates many
client oncoproteins that play key roles in tumor formation
and progression [3, 4, 5]. Therefore, we next examined

whether HDN-1 induced degradation of Hsp90 client
oncoproteins. We found that HDN-1 treatment reduced
the expression levels of EGFR, Stat3, Akt, and Erk, and
their active phosphorylated forms and downregulated the
expression of Raf and Cyclin D1 in H1975, HCC827, and
A549 cells, in dosage- (Figure 4A–4C) and time- (Figure
4D–4F) dependent manners. These results suggested
that binding of HDN-1 to Hsp90 resulted in inhibition of
Hsp90 activity and induced degradation of many client
oncoproteins. Intriguingly, we noticed that HDN-1 did
not obviously affect Hsp70 expression as did 17-AAG
(Figure 4A–4C). It is reported that increase of Hsp70 is a
striking feature induced by Hsp90 N-terminal inhibitors,
such as 17-AAG [12], while Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors
do not regulate Hsp70 expression [19]. Thus, our results
are consistent with the previous reports and further support
that HDN-1 is an Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitor.
Solid tumors typically exhibit regions of poor
oxygen supply or hypoxia, and the HIF-1α regulates
an adaptive response to hypoxia. HIF-1α expression
has been correlated with resistance to radiation and
chemotherapy as well as poor clinical prognosis. Since
HIF-1α is a client protein of Hsp90 [20], we speculated
that HIF-1α expression is regulated by HDN-1. As
expected, HIF-1α was degraded after cells were exposed
to HDN-1 under CoCl2-induced hypoxia (Figure 4G, top
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

panel) or under 5% CO2 and 2% O2 condition (Figure 4G,
bottom panel).
Hsp90 client proteins may response to Hsp90
inhibitors differently. We next compared the sensitivity
of different client proteins to HDN-1 and 17-AAG.
We observed that some client proteins including Abl,
p-Stat3, and Erk were more sensitive to HDN-1 than
17-AAG, while others, such as EGFR and Akt, were more
susceptible to 17-AAG than to HDN-1 (Figure 4H). One
possible explanation is that HDN-1 is an Hsp90 C-terminal
inhibitor and it may have a different selectivity of client
proteins compared with N-terminal inhibitor 17-AAG.

HDN-1 promotes ligand-induced EGFR downregulation
In response to ligand stimulation, EGFR undergoes
a process of desensitization involving endocytosis,
ubiquitination, and lysosomal degradation, which is called
ligand-induced receptor downregulation (LIRD). However,
LIRD was impaired in EGFR mutant-expressing cells. It
is reported that Hsp90 impaired Cbl-mediated receptor
downregulation, and inhibition of Hsp90 function restores
LIRD [21]. To further evaluate the effect of HDN-1
on EGFR degradation, we examined EGFR levels in the
cells treated with EGF for 1 to 5 h. In A549 cells with

wild-type EGFR, EGFR level was markedly reduced
after EGF stimulation for 1 h. In contrast, H1975 and
HCC827 cells with EGFR mutant maintained EGFR levels
upon EGF stimulation (Figure 5A). Of interest, HDN-1
treatment largely reduces the EGFR levels in EGFtreated A549, H1975 and HCC827 cells in dosage- and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

time- dependent manners (Figure 5B). This suggested that
HDN-1 facilitated EGF-induced EGFR downregulation
independent of the EGFR mutation status.
Phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr1045 creates a
major docking site for the adaptor protein c-Cbl, leading

types of lung cancer cells in dosage- and time-dependent

level of EGFR ubiquitination in A549 cells (Figure 5D).
All these results suggested that HDN-1 promotes
EGFR endocytosis and degradation through inhibition
of Hsp90.

of HDN-1. The molecular docking analyses showed that
chaetocin bound to Hsp90 with the same binding sites and
interaction pattern as did HDN-1 (Figure 6C). Furthermore,
chaetocin degraded client proteins, such as EGFR, p-EGFR,
Akt, p-Akt, and Cyclin D1, at a dose similar to HDN-1
(Figure 6D). Notably, the level of SUV39H1 was found to
decline upon chaetocin and HDN-1 treatment (Figure 6E).
These results revealed that chaetocin is an inhibitor of
Hsp90 and suggested that Hsp90 inhibition contribute to the
inhibition on SUV39H1 and that SUV39H1 is a new client
protein of Hsp90.

Chaetocin binds to and inhibits Hsp90
HDN-1 is an analogue of chaetocin (Figure 6A),
which is a fungal mycotoxin with histone methyltransferase
SUV39H1 inhibitory activity [23]. To determine whether
chaetocin also acts as an Hsp90 inhibitor, we determined
chaetocin-Hsp90 binding and Hsp90 activity after chaetocin
treatment. As shown in Figure 6B, chaetocin bound to Hsp90
with Kd values at 16.8 μM, which is close to the Kd values

DISCUSSION
Hsp90 has been intensively targeted for cancer
treatment. Here, we identified HDN-1 and chaetocin as
novel C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors. Chaetocin was regarded
as an inhibitor of SUV39H1 histone methyltrans­ferase.

Our results support that chaetocin has previously unknown
function to bind to Hsp90 and to inhibit Hsp90 activity.
Hsp90α is reported to be essential to the survival of
cancer cells, and the expression of Hsp90α is associated
with different stress factors and leads to tumor progression,
invasion and metastasis [24]. To investigate whether HDN-1
interacts with Hsp90α, we performed SPR analysis and
showed that HDN-1 bound to the full-length and the
C-terminus of Hsp90α with moderate affinity at Kd values
of 14.6 and 201 μM, respectively. These affinities are higher
than those of the current C-terminal inhibitors. Novobiocin,
a C-terminal inhibitor used in cancer therapy, binds weakly
to the C-terminus of ATP binding site (660–680 aa) of
Hsp90α at approximately 3.3 mM [25, 26]. It is reported
that 17-AAG binds to the ATP binding site (34–124 aa) of
Hsp90 [27]. The binding of 17-AAG, novobiocin, and ATP
to Hsp90α did not affect the association of HDN-1 with
Hsp90α. However, HDN-1’s binding to Hsp90α impairs the
subsequent binding of 17-AAG and novobiocin, suggesting
that HDN-1 induced conformational changes of Hsp90α
that affects the access of other inhibitors. These findings
were supported by proteolytic fingerprinting analyses
showing that HDN-1 induced a distinct pattern of Hsp90
digestion to that induced by 17-AAG.
Csermely and his co-workers have reported that
the C-terminal site becomes available for binding only
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

after occupancy of the N-terminal site, and both the
N- and C-terminal chaperone sites may contribute to
Hsp90α function as chaperones [29]. Combination of
novobiocin and GA had enhancing effects on proliferation
inhibition and apoptosis induction of leukemia cells
[30, 31]. In line with these reports, HDN-1 was found to
have enhancing effect in combination with 17-AAG, an
N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitor. The binding of HDN-1 to the
C-terminal region of Hsp90α was further supported by
molecular docking analyses, showing that 526–570 domain
of Hsp90α with two hydrogen bonds binding at Glu529
and Lys564 is the interaction interface. It is reported that
the Hsp90 C-terminus does not exhibit ATPase activity and
is involved in the conformational rearrangement of Hsp90α
upon ATP binding. The ATPase activity of Hsp90, which
leads to a conformational change of the entire homodimer,
is dependent upon the Hsp90 C-terminal region to trap the
nucleotide during the ATPase cycle [32]. We found that
ATP did not interfere HDN-1-Hsp90 binding measured
by SPR spectroscopy while HDN-1 exhibited no effect on
Hsp90α ATPase activity (data not shown). These results
support that the binding of HDN-1 to Hsp90α is different
from current C-terminal inhibitors, such as novobiocin,
cisplatin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which
bind to the Hsp90 C-terminal domain and interferes with
nucleotide binding.

the initial responses of EGFR-mutant tumors to smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, resistance universally
emerges over time. Acquired resistance has been associated
with a second somatic mutation, resulting in a threonineto-methionine substitution at position 790 (T790M) of
EGFR. It have been reported that EGFR mutants depend on
Hsp90 for stability. Crucial targets of Hsp90-active drugs
vary in different cell types, and Hsp90 is permissive for
the development of mutant EGFR-dependent lung cancers,
these kinase domain mutants are degraded by Hsp90
inhibitors [20, 33]. Evaluation of the effects of HDN-1 on
three NSCLC cell lines expressing wild type EGFR (A549),
exon 19 deletions EGFR (HCC827), or T790M EGFR
(H1975) showed that HDN-1 exhibited stronger inhibitory
activity in the two cell lines with EGFR mutation than the
cells with wild type EGFR. Importantly, HDN-1 degrades
multiple client proteins, such as EGFR, Stat3, Akt, Erk, Raf,
Cyclin D1, and HIF, all of which have been reported to be
oncoproteins to promote cancer development. These results
indicate that HDN-1 not only interacts with Hsp90, but also
inhibit the cellular functions of Hsp90.
Inhibition of Hsp90 by targeting its N-terminus
but not its C-terminus is often compensated by increased
expression of Hsp70 as well as other heat shock proteins
[12]. HDN-1, unlike 17-AAG, did not upregulate the
expression of Hsp70, further supporting that HDN-1 is
an Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitor. Furthermore, we found
some client proteins including Abl, p-Stat3, Erk were
more sensitive to HDN-1, while others, such as EGFR,
Akt, p-Akt, p-Erk, were more sensitive to 17-AAG. These
results suggest that inhibitors for the N-terminus and
C-terminus have distinct effect on the selected degradation
of Hsp90 client protein.
In normal tissues, the temporal and spatial distribution
of extracellular growth factors determines the quantity and
quality of intracellular signals. Once activated by stimulation,
EGFR initiates both positive and negative processes that
convey signals to downstream pathways via the interaction
with adaptor proteins and remove receptors from the cell
surface. In the latter case, the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases
plays a major role in ligand-dependent ubiquitination of
many receptor tyrosine kinases [16]. EGFR activation results
in the binding of Cbl to EGFR Tyr1045 for LIRD, and this
EGFR downregulation was impaired in EGFR mutantexpressing cells. Hsp90 was detected in immunoprecipitates
of EGFR and may contribute to the resistance of EGFR
mutants to LIRD; hence, Hsp90 inhibitor would reverse
the resistance [34]. Indeed, our studies showed that HDN-1
increased EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1045 and promoted
Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination and LIRD. These results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

underscore the potential of HDN-1 to overcome the resistance
of tumor cells to EGFR inhibitors.
HDN-1 is analogue of chaetocin, which was
previously identified as a specific inhibitor of histone
methyltransferase SUV39H1 [35]. However, another report
shows that chaetocin was a nonspecific SUV39H1 inhibitor
[36]. Here, we found that chaetocin inhibited multiple client
proteins of Hsp90, which is unlikely due to the inhibition
of SUV39H1. SUV39H1 specifically methylates K9 of
histone H3 (H3K9me3) in the promoter regions of genes,
leading to repression of genes and inhibition of cell cycle
progression and cell proliferation. Downregulation of
H3K9me3 has been observed in several types of human
cancers (such as colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung
cancer), which arise from either the deficiency of H3K9
methyltransferases or elevated activity or expression of
H3K9 demethylases [37]. We demonstrated that chaetocin
was inhibitors of Hsp90 and reduced SUV39H1 expression,
suggesting that SUV39H1 is a new client protein of Hsp90
and chaetocin inhibits SUV39H1 by inhibiting Hsp90mediated SUV39H1 stability.
In conclusion, we demonstrate HDN-1 is a novel
inhibitor of Hsp90, binding to the 526–570 regions in the
C-terminus, but not to the second ATP binding site. In
addition, our results support that chaetocin is an inhibitor
of Hsp90 and regulates SUV39H1 stability. As novel
inhibitors of C-terminus of Hsp90, HDN-1 and chaetocin
are promising anticancer compounds.

METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The H1975 and HCC827 cell lines were purchased
from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% FBS. The A549 cell line was maintained in
F12K medium containing 10% FBS. HDN-1 was provided
by School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University
of China; Chaetocin, 17-AAG and TPCK-treated trypsin
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; FITC-GA was
purchased from Enzo Life Science. Hsp90α, C-Hsp90α,
and EGF were from Abcam and Pepro Tech. Antibodies to
detect EGFR, p-EGFR (Tyr1068), Akt, p-Akt, Erk, p-Erk,
HIF-1α, p-EGFR (Tyr1045) and ubiquitination were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies to
detect Stat3, p-Stat3, Raf, and CyclinD1 were purchased
from Enzo Life Science. Primary antibody against
SUV39H1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell viability assay
A modified tetrazolium salt assay was used to
measure the inhibition of cancer cell growth. Cancer
cells were plated into a 96-well microtiter plate
containing 0.1 ml of growth media/well for 24 h, then
were incubated with HDN-1 at indicated concentrations
5271

Oncotarget

dissolved in DMSO for 72 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) was added
to each well of a 96-well plate. After 4 h incubation,
the formazan product was dissolved and quantitated
spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 560 nm.
Percent viability of each sample was calculated from
the A560 values as follows: % viability = (A560 nm
sample / A560 nm DMSO-treated cells × 100). The IC50
was defined as the concentration that gave rise to 50%
inhibition of cell viability.

into Hsp90α-immobilized chip and the RU values were
recorded in succession for indicated time, then these
compounds were replaced by 50 μM HDN-1, and RU
values were recorded unceasingly. Similar experiments
were conversely performed and RU values were recorded.
For C-terminal Hsp90α, the human purified C-Hsp90α was
biotinylated using NHS-LCLC-biotin. Superstreptavidin
biosensors were coated in a solution containing 10 μg/ml
of biotinylated protein for 5 min at 30°C. A duplicate set
of sensors was incubated in an assay buffer (1 × kinetics
buffer of ForteBio’s Inc.) with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide
without protein for use as a background binding control.
Both sets of sensors were blocked with a solution of
5 μM biocytin for 60 s at 30°C. Binding of samples
(31.25–500 μM) to coated and uncoated reference sensors
was measured over 60 s. Data analysis on the ForteBio’s
Octet RED96 instrument were performed using a double
reference subtraction (sample and sensor references) in the
ForteBio’s data analysis software. The analysis accounts
for non-specific binding, background and signal drift and
minimizes well based and sensor variability.

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
analysis
Cells were incubated with HDN-1 at indicated
concentrations and time, then washed with PBS twice,
disrupted on ice for 30 min in loading buffer, and boiled
for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined with
BCA reagent. Equal amounts of protein in cell lysates
were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes,
immunoblotted with indicated primary and secondary
antibodies, and detected by chemiluminescence with
the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents
(PIERCE). The antibodies of following proteins were
used: EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr1068), Akt,
phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), MAPK, phosphorylated
MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), ubiquitin, Hsp70, β-Actin; Abl,
Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3 (Ser727), Raf-1, cyclin D1.
For immunoprecipitation assay, cell lysate protein was
incubated overnight at 4°C with the designated antibody
and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences)
was added overnight while rocking. Precipitates were
washed three times with lysis buffer and once with PBS,
resuspended in 2 × loading buffer, and resolved by SDSPAGE followed by immunoblot analysis.

Proteolytic fingerprinting
Proteolytic fingerprinting assay was conducted as
described previously [38]. Briefly, Hsp90α (0.6 μg) was
incubated with HDN-1 (0.2 mM) or 17-AAG (0.2 mM)
in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) at 37°C for 5 min. The
samples were digested on ice with TPCK-treated trypsin,
which selectively cleaves peptide bonds C-terminal to
lysine and arginine residues, for 6 min at the concentration
of 30 and 150 μg/ml. The reactions were terminated by
adding SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 3–5
min. The digested products were analyzed by Western
blotting with Hsp90 (AC88) antibody.

Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR)

Analysis of drug combination studies

SPR analysis was carried out with a ProteOn
XPR36 instrument (Bio-Rad) or ForteBio’s Octet RED96
to determine binding of various molecules to full length
Hsp90α or C-terminal Hsp90α. For full length Hsp90α,
Hsp90α was coupled to the surface of a GLH sensor chip
using amine coupling. The coupling has been performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Binding
experiments were performed with multiple concentrations
of HDN-1 and chaetocin running over the surface of the
chip at 25°C, at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min in PBS-T
(10 mM Phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and 0.005%
Tween20 [v/v]). The sensor chip surface was regenerated
using 0.85% H3PO4. Changes in mass due to the binding
response were recorded as resonance units (RU). To
obtain the dissociation constant (Kd), these responses
were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model by nonlinear
regression using the BiaEvaluation 4.1 software program.
For interplay of HDN-1 with other molecules, 50 μM
17-AAG, 50 μM novobiocin, or 100 μM ATP was injected
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

H1975 cell were seeded in triplicate in 96-well
plates and treated with HDN-1 or 17-AAG alone or
with the combination of HDN-1 and 17-AAG at the
indicated doses. MTT assays were performed after 72 h of
treatment. The Q (value) was calculated according to Jin’s
formula: Q = Ea+b/(Ea+Eb−Ea × Eb). Ea+b represented the
inhibition rate of drug combination, Ea and Eb represented
the inhibition rate of drug A and B alone, respectively.
Q (value) = 0.85–1.15 stands for additivity, Q (value) >
1.15–2.0 stands for synergism, and Q (value) < 0.85–0.55
stands for antagonism [18].

Fluorescence polarization assays
Fluorescence polarization assays were performed
under the following conditions: each 96-well plate contained
200 nM FITC-GA, Hsp90α (30 nM), and tested inhibitor
(initial stock in DMSO) in a final volume of 100 μl. For each
5272

Oncotarget

assay, background wells (buffer only), tracer controls (free,
FITC-GA only), and bound GA controls (fluorescent GA in
the presence of Hsp90) were included on each assay plate.
The fraction of tracer bound to Hsp90 was correlated to the
mP value and plotted against log10 values of competitor
concentrations. The HDN-1 and 17-AAG concentrations
at which 50% of bound GA was displaced was obtained
by fitting the data. Fluorescence intensity measurements
were obtained using a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). The excitation and emission wavelengths
were 485 nm and 530 nm, respectively.

Three-dimensional structure building and all
modeling were performed using the SYBYL-X 1.10
(Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) Program Package [39]
installed on a FOUNDER Wenxiang E520 workstation
running the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (version 5) operating
system. Energy minimization was performed using Powell
optimization in the presence of the Tripos force field with a
convergence criterion of 0.05 kcal/mol•Å and then assigned
with the Gasteiger-Hückel charges. The 3D structures of
Hsp90 (PDB: 2CGE) [40] was taken from the Research
Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data
Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). Following the receptor’s
preparation, all hydrogen bonds were added and the side
chain amides in all Asn and Gln oriented to maximize
hydrogen bonding. Minimization was performed for 100
iterations using the AMBER FF99 force field [41] rflexDock Program interfaced with SYBYL-X was used to dock
HDN-1 and chaetocin in the active sites of Hsp90.
