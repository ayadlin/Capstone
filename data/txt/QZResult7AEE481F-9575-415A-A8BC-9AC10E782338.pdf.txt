Abstract
Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, has cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models.
It has been shown to downregulate the levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) in rodents. The purpose of
the study was to assess its safety, pharmacokinetics, and effects on circulating levels of IGF-I and IGF-binding
protein-3 (IGFBP-3) after repeated dosing. Forty healthy volunteers ingested resveratrol at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 g
daily for 29 days. Levels of resveratrol and its metabolites were measured by high performance liquid chromatography-UV in plasma obtained before and up to 24 hours after a dose between days 21 and 28. IGF-I and
IGFBP-3 were measured by ELISA in plasma taken predosing and on day 29. Resveratrol was safe, but the 2.5
and 5 g doses caused mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms. Resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4′-Oglucuronide, and resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide were major plasma metabolites. Maximal plasma levels and
areas under the concentration versus time curve for the metabolites dramatically exceeded those for resveratrol, in the case of areas under the concentration versus time curve, by up to 20.3-fold. Compared with predosing values, the ingestion of resveratrol caused a decrease in circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (P < 0.04 for
both), respectively, in all volunteers. The decrease was most marked at the 2.5 g dose level. The results suggest
that repeated administration of high doses of resveratrol generates micromolar concentrations of parent and
much higher levels of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in the plasma. The observed decrease in circulating
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 might contribute to cancer chemopreventive activity. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9003–11. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Resveratrol, a polyphenol which occurs in red grapes and
red wine, has been shown to prevent cancer, or delay its
onset, in a variety of rodent models of carcinogenesis (1, 2).
Resveratrol can also retard parameters linked to aging and
acts as a calorie-restriction mimetic in mice (3, 4), important
findings in the light of emerging evidence of a possible association between calorie restriction and anticarcinogenesis
(5). The abundance of information on biochemical effects
of resveratrol in cultured cells potentially linked to anticarciAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Cancer Biomarkers and Prevention Group,

nogenesis (6) contrasts with a scarcity of studies in humans.
Published human studies typically employed single doses of
up to 25 mg of resveratrol, mostly as a constituent of wine,
grapefruit juice, or grape extract (7). Reports on trials of
resveratrol in humans after single (8, 9) or multiple daily
doses of up to 600 mg/d administered over 2 or 3 days (10,
11) suggest that it is safe under the tested conditions. The
pharmacodynamic properties of resveratrol after repeated
dosing in humans have hitherto not been described.
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling system,
which consists of IGFs, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP), and
IGF receptors, crucially influences malignant development.
IGFs possess potent antiapoptotic and mitogenic properties
(12, 13) and affect cell differentiation, neoplastic transformation, and metastasis (13–15). The IGF system is regulated by
IGFBPs, prominently IGFBP-3, which bind IGFs in the extracellular milieu with high affinity and specificity, thus reducing circulating levels of IGFs. Several studies suggest a direct
relationship between the levels of IGF-I, and an inverse relationship between the levels of IGFBP-3, and risk of colorectal,
prostate, breast, or lung cancer (16). Individuals suffering
from acromegaly, a somatic disease associated with increased IGF-I, have an elevated risk of colorectal cancer
(17). IGF-I has also been suggested to contribute to the development of adenomatous polyps (18). The anticarcinogenic

activity of dietary restriction in preclinical models of carcinogenicity is thought to be mediated, at least in part, via reduction of circulating IGF-I (19). Modulation of the IGF system
has been proposed as a mechanism by which certain agents,
for example 9-cis-retinoic acid, might prevent cancer (20).
Resveratrol lowered circulating IGF-I in diabetic mice on a
high-calorie diet (3) and in prostate tumor tissue of TRAMP
mice (21), a genetic model of prostate carcinogenesis.
Information on the effect of resveratrol on IGFBP-3 has not
been provided in these two studies.
The potential of resveratrol as a cancer chemopreventive
agent and/or calorie-restriction mimetic in humans is a
topic of considerable interest (2, 5), but potential biomarkers of its efficacy, such as levels of components of the
IGF signaling pathway, in humans are virtually unknown.
We conducted a trial of repeat high-dose resveratrol in
healthy volunteers with the aim of exploring its safety,
the pharmacokinetics of parent agent and its major metabolites, and the effect of resveratrol on circulating levels of
IGF-I and IGFBP-3.

Materials and Methods
Volunteers
Healthy volunteers (55% male, 65% Caucasian, 15% Asian,
12.5% Afro-Caribbean or biracial, 7.5% Hispanic) were recruited into the study at either the Universities of Leicester
(United Kingdom) or Michigan (United States) and gave
written informed consent. Eligibility criteria included
willingness to abstain from ingestion of large quantities of
resveratrol-containing foods. Exclusion criteria included
chronic medications including vitamins (except for oral or
depot contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy).
The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (web site
address: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) as NCT 00098969. It
was reviewed and approved by the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland Research Ethics Committee (Nottingham, United Kingdom), and the University of Michigan
Institutional Review Board (IRBMED, Ann Arbor, MI) and
conducted in accordance with the applicable guidelines
on Good Clinical Practice. At the predosing screening visit,
the volunteer's medical history was recorded including
regular/occasional use of medication and vitamins. Four
subjects, who terminated intervention prematurely, were
replaced, so that overall 40 individuals, 10 per dose level,
completed the intervention. Mean and range (in brackets)
of ages and body mass indices for the four different dosing
groups were as follows: age (in years)—0.5 g, 35 (20–49); 1.0
g, 36 (20–58); 2.5 g, 37 (24–51); 5.0 g, 42 (21–73); body mass
index (in kg/m2)—0.5 g, 27.5 (20.0–42.4); 1.0 g, 25.2 (18.6–
39.4); 2.5 g, 26.3 (19.3–39.0); and 5.0 g, 25.4 (19.2–32.8).
The values did not differ significantly between dose groups.
Study design and resveratrol dose
Study participants ingested uncoated immediate-release
caplets manufactured to good manufacturing practice standards by Pharmascience, Inc. Caplets contained 500 mg of
chemically synthesized resveratrol. The stability of the for-

9004

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

mulation was tested according to good manufacturing practice stipulations. Participants were recruited sequentially to
four dose levels of resveratrol (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 g) and instructed to ingest the appropriate dose between 7:00 and 9:00
a.m. daily for 29 days. Participants completed a form after
each dose and were evaluated on a weekly basis for adverse
events and compliance with dosing. An adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 was
attributed to resveratrol by the site study team on the basis
of detailed description of symptoms, their duration and other
pertinent factors (medication, food intake). Volunteers were
recruited to the next dose level when the absence of unacceptable toxicity in the final participant on the previous dose
level had been established within a 14-day waiting period.
Sample preparation and high performance liquid
chromatography analysis
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of resveratrol
and its metabolites were collected prior to resveratrol administration (predose) on day 1, and at predose and 0.25, 1.0, 1.5,
5, 12, and 24 hours postdose on a day between the 21st and
the 28th day of dosing. Blood samples were collected into
lithium-heparinized tubes from which plasma was obtained
and stored at −80°C until analysis.
Sample preparation, which entailed the extraction of
acidified plasma with methanol, and high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)-UV analysis for quantification of
resveratrol and its metabolites were performed as described
previously (9, 22). Separation was achieved on a Waters
Atlantis C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm 3 μm; Waters) in
combination with a Waters Atlantic C 18 guard column
(4.6 mm × 20 mm, 3 μm). Quantitation of resveratrol using
a gradient HPLC-UV system (Waters Alliance 2695; Waters,
Corp.) was performed as described before, and the method
has been validated in terms of interday and intraday variability, recovery, accuracy, and precision (22). The retention time
of resveratrol was 18.6 minutes, its lower limit of detection
was 5 ng/mL. As authentic resveratrol metabolites were not
available in sufficient quantities as reference materials, metabolite amounts were calculated as “resveratrol equivalents,” on
the assumption that recovery characteristics and relationship
between peak area ratio and concentration were the same as
for the parent resveratrol. Authentic resveratrol-3-O-sulfate
(also provided by Pharmascience), resveratrol-4′-O-sulfate,
resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, and resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide
became available during the course of the study by inhouse synthesis, permitting HPLC peak identification, so
that resveratrol metabolites could be identified by cochromatography. Metabolite identity was confirmed by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with selected
reaction monitoring, operated in negative ion mode using an
Agilent 1100 series HPLC with in-line Applied Biosystems/
MDS SCIEX API 2000 ion spray triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) under chromatographic
conditions described previously (9, 22). Definitive isomer
identification was not possible for resveratrol disulfate
and resveratrol sulfate glucuronide.

Pharmacokinetics and IGF Axis Modulation by Resveratrol

Determination of IGF-I and IGFBP-3
Blood samples to assay IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were obtained,
following overnight fasting, before the first dose and before
the last dose of resveratrol on day 29, or in the case of three
individuals who ingested resveratrol for an additional day or
two, on days 30 or 31. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations in
serum were determined using ELISA kits DG100 and BAF675,
respectively (R&D Systems), with predosing and postdosing
samples from each person analyzed on the same 96-well
plate. Assays for both species were performed in parallel,
and serum samples were analyzed in triplicate, standards
in duplicate. The IGF-I assay includes a step which releases
IGF-I from binding proteins. Assays were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer and blinded with
respect to subject. Samples were stable over the period elapsing between collection of predose and postdose blood when
stored at −80°C, as illustrated by comparing samples analyzed fresh and after 3 months of storage, which showed a
variation of <5%.
Pharmacokinetic parameters
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
for resveratrol and its metabolites using a noncompartmental
approach: Cmax = maximal plasma concentration over the
collection period; Cav = average plasma concentration over
the collection period; Tmax = time of Cmax; T1/2 = apparent
first-order elimination half-life calculated as ln(2) / λz (λz =
apparent first-order elimination constant calculated from
semi-log plot of plasma concentration versus time curve);
AUClast = area under the plasma concentration versus time
curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration above
the limit of quantitation, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal
method. Apparent total body clearance (CL/F) and apparent
volume of distribution (V/F) for resveratrol were calculated
as dose/AUC and dose / (λz × AUC), respectively.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, coefficient of variation,
median) were calculated for plasma concentrations of resveratrol and its metabolites. Geometric mean and coefficient of
variation values were calculated for concentrations and
derived pharmacokinetic parameters using R v.2.9.2 (open
source implementation of S statistical programming language;
Bell Laboratories) on MS Windows and Linux. The proportionality between Cmax or AUC and dose for resveratrol was
evaluated using the power model and confidence interval approaches as described by Chow and Liu (23) omitting results
for the 0.5 g dose, as many of the plasma concentration values
at this dose were near or below the limit of quantitation.
Differences between preintervention and postintervention
IGF protein levels in study volunteers (preintervention minus
postintervention levels) were subjected to statistical evaluation using Student's paired t test with the “Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences” software. The test compares the
mean of the differences between preintervention and postintervention values with zero; P < 0.05 values indicate that the
difference between preintervention and postintervention was
significantly different from zero.

Results
Safety of resveratrol
Healthy volunteers received resveratrol daily for 29 days at
daily doses of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 g. Resveratrol was safe, as
borne out by the lack of serious adverse reactions detected
by clinical, biochemical, or hematologic analyses during the
study and study follow-up. Of the total 44 volunteers who received resveratrol, including those who terminated the intervention prematurely, 28 reported one or more adverse events
while on the study. Seven of these individuals were on the
0.5 g dose, four on the 1.0 g dose, eight on the 2.5 g dose,
and nine on the 5.0 g dose. Table 1 describes the nature of
only those adverse events deemed to be possibly or probably
associated with resveratrol intake. The majority of events
reported by the volunteers on the two highest dose levels
(2.5 and 5.0 g) were gastrointestinal symptoms, including
nausea, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Most
of these events were mild (severity grade 1, NCI CTCAE v.4.0),
although four participants on the 2.5 and 5.0 g doses presented with nausea and/or diarrhea of moderate severity
(grade 2). The gastrointestinal side effects commenced after

2 to 4 days of the intervention and occurred 30 minutes to 1
hour after resveratrol ingestion. Symptoms, which tended to
improve throughout the day and return after the following
dose, resolved within 2 days of completing the 29-day course.
There was no weight loss in any participant, and all volunteers maintained normal performance status throughout the
study period.
Pharmacokinetics of resveratrol and its metabolites
Plasma from 40 volunteers was collected at multiple
time points after resveratrol ingestion on a day between
the 21st and the 28th day of intervention, and analyzed for
the presence of parent agent and metabolites. As reported
previously in volunteers after a single dose of resveratrol (9),
parent resveratrol, and six metabolic conjugates, resveratrol3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4′-O-sulfate, resveratrol disulfate,
resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide, and
a resveratrol sulfate glucuronide, were identified by HPLC-UV
cochromatography with authentic reference material and/or
HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry in volunteers' plasma
(results not shown). The most abundant circulating resveratrol
metabolite was resveratrol-3-O-sulfate.
Plasma concentrations of resveratrol and its three major metabolites, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide,
and resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, were measured by HPLC-UV,
and plasma concentration versus time curves are shown
in Fig. 1. Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from these plots
are summarized in Table 2. Resveratrol was rapidly absorbed
yielding peak concentrations (C max ) at 1 hour postdose.
The mean average plasma concentration (Cav) and Cmax values
of parent resveratrol across the four dose levels ranged
from 0.04 to 0.55 nmol/mL and 0.19 to 4.24 nmol/mL, respec-

tively. The corresponding concentrations of the major resveratrol conjugates exceeded those of their parent molecule by
factors of between 3.8 and 16.5 for Cav and between 2.4 and
12.9 for Cmax. Of the metabolites, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate displayed the greatest Cav and Cmax values, ranging from 0.5 to
6.1 nmol/mL and from 2.5 to 18.3 nmol/mL, respectively, across
the four doses. The plasma elimination half-lives varied
between 4.77 and 9.70 hours for resveratrol and between
3.09 and 8.14 hours for the major metabolites. The mean values
for the AUClast for resveratrol were 175 ng × h/mL at the lowest,
and 4,097 ng × h/mL at the highest dose. The respective AUClast
values at these doses for resveratrol-3-O-sulfate were 20.3- and
9.49-fold higher, those for resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide 7.61and 4.88-fold higher, and those for resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide
5.00- and 5.39-fold higher, than the AUCs for resveratrol (Table
2). The apparent total body clearances and apparent volumes
of distribution for resveratrol are consistent with its rapid
metabolism and low bioavailability (Table 3). When plotted
versus dose, mean Cmax and AUC values for resveratrol and
its metabolites increased with dose in a manner grossly proportional to dose (Fig. 2). This relationship was analyzed statistically (23) for parent resveratrol, and the analysis supported
dose proportionality for Cmax and AUC at the 1.0 to 5.0 g
dose levels.
Effect of resveratrol on circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in plasma samples obtained on
day 29 were compared with those taken just prior to the first
dose of resveratrol. Consumption of resveratrol reduced IGFI and IGFBP-3 levels weakly, albeit significantly, when results
from all trial participants were combined. Mean differences
between preintervention and postintervention levels, 95%

IGFBP-3 in the individual volunteers. In those on the 2.5 g
dose, levels of IGF-I were most prominently and consistently
reduced (Fig. 3), with a difference between preintervention
and postintervention IGF-I levels (in ng/mL) of 29.6 (95% confidence interval, 21.5–37.8; P < 0.001). IGF-I levels were not significantly affected in volunteers on the 0.5 or 1.0 g doses. Mean
IGFBP-3 concentrations in individuals on the 1.0 or 2.5 g doses
of resveratrol were also significantly reduced by resveratrol.
The differences between preintervention and postintervention
IGFBP-3 levels with 95% confidence intervals (both in ng/mL)
and P values were 279 (62–496; P = 0.03) for the 1.0 g dose and
210 (49–372; P = 0.03) for the 2.5 g dose (Fig. 3). The ratio IGFI/IGFBP-3 for the 2.5 g dose cohort was also strongly reduced
(data not shown). At 5 g, resveratrol failed to affect the IGF
system significantly.

Discussion
In this report, we describe the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol after repeated oral administration of high doses and
define potential pharmacodynamic end points pertinent to

optimize future long-term intervention studies of resveratrol.
Doses of up to 5 g given daily for 29 days were safe, although
the two highest doses used here (2.5 and 5 g) caused gastrointestinal symptoms of mild to moderate severity. On the basis
of these findings, we would tentatively recommend that in future intervention studies of resveratrol the daily dose should
perhaps not exceed 1.0 g. The highest dose generated circulating peak levels of the parent agent which approached concentrations reported to cause pharmacologic activity in cells
in vitro (24). Circulating levels of its major metabolites, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide, and resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, were much higher, in the case of the
sulfate, the highest dose yielded a mean Cmax of 18.3 μmol/L.
These results are important in light of the suspicion that resveratrol metabolites may contribute to the pharmacologic
activity of the parent agent (2). Experimental evidence to support this notion is scarce, but recent publications suggests that
resveratrol sulfate conjugates could induce quinone reductase
and inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes, nitric oxide production,

9008

and NFκB induction in cells in vitro (25, 26). It is not known
whether resveratrol metabolites can engage estrogenic effects,
a property which the parent agent is suspected to possess (27),
although this notion has been disputed (28). Although the
Cmax and AUC values described here for resveratrol and its metabolites after multiple resveratrol doses are similar to those
reported previously after single dose resveratrol at levels identical to those used here (9), there are subtle differences (Fig. 4).
In the case of the 0.5 g dose, the Cmax values for resveratrol-3O-sulfate and the two monoglucuronides after repeat resveratrol were 50% to 60% of those after a single dose, consistent
with multiple administration of resveratrol at this dose causing inhibition of its metabolic conjugation or augmentation of
metabolite elimination. In contrast, after the 5 g dose, the Cmax
values for parent resveratrol and the two resveratrol glucuronides after multiple dosing were approximately double those
after single dose resveratrol, indicative of accumulation of parent and glucuronides. After multiple administration of the 5 g
dose, the AUC values for resveratrol and its metabolites were
higher than those observed after single dosing; however, these
differences did not reach significance levels (results not
shown). Although the design of the study does not allow delineation of steady state, it is conceivable that steady state was
achieved. Given that the time to steady state is three to five
half-lives, and the half-life of resveratrol administered once
daily was 4.8 to 9.7 hours, approximately 15 hours to 2 days
would be required to attain steady-state. It needs to be
stressed that the dosing regime was not optimized in this
study, and a shorter dosing interval might have been used to
increase the steady state concentrations and maintain levels
within a narrower range. Likewise, sustained release formulations of resveratrol might possess pharmacokinetic properties
superior to those of the caplet formulation used in this study.
However, it is pertinent to point out that in a recent phase 1
study in colorectal cancer patients who ingested 0.5 or 1.0 g of
the same resveratrol formulation used here daily for 7 days,
resveratrol was still present at concentrations of between 8.3
and 674 nmol/g tissue in surgically resected colon tissue beyond ∼6 hours after the last dose (29). This means that for
the prevention of colorectal malignancies by resveratrol, the
once daily dosing schedule used in the present investigation
might well be sufficient. The results suggest that repeated
consumption of resveratrol may decrease circulating levels
of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. These observations render IGF proteins
potential biomarkers of pharmacologic activity of resveratrol
in humans. The reduction of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 by resveratrol
did not follow a linear dose-response relationship at the dose
range tested here. Although the effect of resveratrol was not
significant at the lowest (0.5 g) or highest (5.0 g) doses, significant decreases were observed at the medium dose of 2.5 g.
Unconventional dose-pharmacologic response relationships
have been described for resveratrol before. For example, in a
murine model of aorta repair in vivo, resveratrol at 10 mg/kg
increased both endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in
injured arteries and the number of endothelial progenitor cells
in the circulation, although such responses were not elicited
by 50 mg/kg (30). It needs to be emphasized that the current
study only hints at the possibility that high-dose resveratrol

Pharmacokinetics and IGF Axis Modulation by Resveratrol

could depress circulating levels of IGF proteins, and these observations need to be corroborated in long-term studies with
larger numbers of participants. If IGF protein modulation is
indeed found to be a genuine property of resveratrol, its
consumption for years—rather than weeks—may profoundly
affect IGF axis signaling. The findings reported here for resveratrol have to be interpreted in the light of the importance of
the IGF system for the development of malignancies. High levels of IGF-I have been causally associated with risk of several
cancers (16), so that the ability to decrease IGF-I, which we
have shown here may be achieved in humans by resveratrol,
constitutes an anticarcinogenic mechanism. Intervention
with 9-cis-retinoic acid for 3 months decreased circulating
IGF-I in former smokers (20). Reduction in IGF-I is often
the corollary of elevation of IGFBP-3 concentrations, which
sequester IGF-I and decrease its bioavailability and thus its
interaction with IGF receptors by which it engages mitogenic
and antiapoptotic actions. The results presented here show
that exposure to resveratrol did not elevate IGFBP-3 levels
in humans, rather there was some reduction. It is difficult
to interpret this finding in terms of contribution to the
mechanisms by which resveratrol may exert chemoprevention. Circulating levels of IGFBP-3 are now thought to be
directly associated with an increased risk of common cancers,
albeit associations are modest and vary between sites

(31, 32). On the basis of these insights, one may argue that
the resveratrol-induced decrease in circulating IGFBP-3, like
the decrease in IGF-I, may constitute an anticarcinogenic
event.
Importantly, the ingestion of resveratrol for 29 days neither significantly affected circulating levels of prostaglandin
E2, reflecting perturbation of the arachidonic acid cascade,
nor influence leukocyte levels of the malondialdehyde-DNA
adduct M1dG, reflecting DNA oxidation, in a plausible and
consistent fashion (results not shown). The effects of resveratrol on the levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, prostaglandin E2, or
M1dG in individuals were not correlated with any of the
pharmacokinetic parameters.
In summary, resveratrol has been shown here to be safe
after 29 daily doses of 0.5 to 5 g. There was a hint of pharmacodynamic activity in terms of effect on circulating IGF protein levels at the 2.5 g dose level, which engendered a mean
plasma peak level of 1.45 μmol/L. Future studies should establish whether resveratrol could also modulate the IGF axis
when given for periods exceeding 29 days at doses below
those eliciting gastrointestinal symptoms, and elucidate the
mechanisms involved. Resveratrol is representative of a
group of diet-derived putative cancer chemopreventive
agents encompassing, among others, curcumin, tea polyphenols, and apigenin, which have attracted a lot of interest in

5.0 g daily for 28 d. Results of the statistical analysis by paired t test, i.e., mean differences between preintervention and postintervention levels
(preintervention minus postintervention values in ng/mL), 95% confidence intervals (in parentheses) and P values, are shown for each group of
10 individuals below the graphs. Negative values signify an increase rather than a decrease in levels. Blood samples were taken just prior to the first dose of
resveratrol and on day 29.

the cancer chemoprevention community. The interest stems
from the fact that these agents can engage a plethora of
intriguing anticarcinogenic mechanisms in cellular studies
in vitro, although hardly any of these processes have hitherto
been explored as potential efficacy biomarkers in humans.
The indication described here that resveratrol affects the
IGF axis hints at the possibility that IGF-I and/or IGFBP-3
may serve as potential markers of chemopreventive efficacy
when these dietary agents are eventually evaluated in definitive clinical chemoprevention studies.
