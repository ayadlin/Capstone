SUMMARY
Activating mutations in Gαq proteins, which form the a subunit of certain heterotrimeric G
proteins, drive uveal melanoma oncogenesis by triggering multiple downstream signaling
pathways, including PLC/PKC, Rho/Rac, and YAP. Here we show that the small GTPase ARF6
acts as a proximal node of oncogenic Gαq signaling to induce all of these downstream pathways
as well as β-catenin signaling. ARF6 activates these diverse pathways through a common
mechanism—the trafficking of GNAQ and β-catenin from the plasma membrane to cytoplasmic
vesicles and the nucleus, respectively. Blocking ARF6 with a small molecule reduces uveal
melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a mouse model, confirming the functional
relevance of this pathway and suggesting a therapeutic strategy for Gα-mediated diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Mutations that confer constitutive activity to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or Gα
proteins have been identified in numerous diseases, including human cancers (Dorsam and
Gutkind, 2007; Marinissen and Gutkind, 2001; O'Hayre et al., 2014; O'Hayre et al., 2013),
McCune-Albright syndrome (Weinstein et al., 1991), and Sturge-Weber syndrome
(Nakashima et al., 2014; Shirley et al., 2013). One such disease is uveal melanoma in which
over 80% of tumors harbor an oncogenic activating mutation in either of two Gαq class
(Gαq) proteins: GNAQ and GNA11 (Van Raamsdonk et al., 2009; Van Raamsdonk et al.,
2010).

Author Manuscript

Uveal melanoma is the most common primary ocular malignancy, and there are no effective
treatments for metastatic forms of this disease. The discovery of oncogenic GNAQ and
GNA11 mutations in uveal melanoma has led to the identification of multiple downstream
signaling pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic purposes (Shoushtari and Carvajal,
2014). These signaling pathways include phospholipase C-b (PLC-β)/protein kinase C
(PKC) and Rac1/RhoA, which lead to the activation of ERK, p38, JNK, and YAP and
subsequent AP-1- and YAP/TEAD-mediated transcription (Feng et al., 2014; Khalili et al.,
2012; Vaque et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012b; Yu et al., 2014). However, it has been unclear
how activating mutations in Gαq proteins exert their control over these divergent
downstream pathways and whether activated Gαq proteins govern additional oncogenic
pathways.

Author Manuscript

The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) (Kahn and Gilman, 1984) is an
attractive candidate for being an effector of Gαq signaling. ARF6 is activated by a variety of
different ARF-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs), depending on the
stimulating factor or cell type. Heterologous expression studies in HEK293T cells have
suggested that activated Gαq proteins associate with various ARF-GEFs, which leads to the
activation of ARF6 (Giguere et al., 2006; Laroche et al., 2007). Other studies have shown
the crucial role ARF6 plays in invasion, metastasis, and proliferation of several different
types of cancers (Grossmann et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009;
Morishige et al., 2008; Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009). ARF6 is a critical mediator of
endocytosis and the recycling of multiple membrane receptors, including GPCRs and
cadherin-catenin complexes (Chen et al., 2003; D'Souza-Schorey et al., 1995; HunzickerDunn et al., 2002; Palacios et al., 2001). We recently demonstrated that in human cutaneous
melanoma cells, WNT5A-stimulation of the GPCR FZD4 activates ARF6, which promotes
the trafficking of β-catenin from its N-cadherin-bound membrane form to the nucleus where
it stimulates TCF-mediated transcription (Grossmann et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

In this study, we investigate the role of ARF6 as a mediator of all known oncogenic
signaling pathways that are controlled by activating GNAQ mutations. The mechanism of
ARF6 action is examined by determining whether it regulates GNAQ and β-catenin
trafficking in uveal melanoma cells. We also assess the efficacy of targeting ARF6 for
therapeutic purposes in a murine orthotopic xenograft model of human uveal melanoma.
Finally, we seek to provide a mechanistic framework for studying other cancers harboring

activating Gα mutations and an alternative approach for identifying therapeutic targets for
these cancers.

RESULTS
Oncogenic GNAQ promotes ARF6 activation to control the proliferation of uveal melanoma
cells

We investigated whether ARF6 might also be important in cancers harboring somatic
activating mutations of Gαq based on the reported role of ARF6 in several cancers
(Grossmann et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009; Morishige et al.,
2008; Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009) and studies showing that Gαq proteins can activate
or signal through ARF6 (Bose et al., 2001; Giguere et al., 2006; Laroche et al., 2007). We
first examined ARF6 protein levels in human uveal melanomas that carried activating
mutations in either GNAQ or GNA11. ARF6 protein levels were on average 1.7-fold higher
in uveal melanomas than in normal choroid melanocytes isolated from eyes that were
surgically removed due to uveal melanoma (Figure S1A). We next tested whether GNAQ in
Mel92.1 and Mel202 uveal melanoma cells was required for ARF6 activation. Mel202 and
Mel92.1 cells carry GNAQQ209L, the most common activating mutation in GNAQ
(Griewank et al., 2012; Van Raamsdonk et al., 2009). The levels of ARF6-GTP were
measured following GNAQ knockdown using two different siRNAs. Each knockdown
reduced ARF-GTP levels by greater than 50% compared to a negative control siRNA that
lacks homology to any known mammalian gene (Figure 1A). Consistent with these results,
HEK293T cells transfected with vectors expressing GNAQQ209L exhibited elevated levels of
ARF6-GTP whereas those cells expressing wild-type GNAQ did not (Figure S1B).
Knockdown of GNAQ in cultured uveal melanoma cells has been shown to inhibit cell
growth (Van Raamsdonk et al., 2009). To determine if this inhibition is ARF6 dependent, we
compared growth parameters between uveal melanoma cells transfected with siRNAs
directed against ARF6 or GNAQ. Knockdown of ARF6 or GNAQ in both Mel92.1 and
Mel202 cells caused similar reductions in cell proliferation and anchorage-independent
colony growth (Figure 1B–1D). These results demonstrate a central role for ARF6 in
oncogenic GNAQ-mediated cell proliferation.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether ARF6 activation can rescue reduced GNAQ expression, we expressed
constitutively active ARF6 (ARF6Q67L) in Mel202 cells while knocking down GNAQ
expression. Both cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony growth were partially
rescued by constitutively active ARF6 when GNAQ expression was knocked down (Figure
S1C–S1E), suggesting that the activation of ARF6 may serve to enhance oncogenic GNAQ
signaling, not replace it. Constitutively active ARF6 may act through the residual GNAQ
present following GNAQ knockdown to partially rescue the function of GNAQ.
GNAQ acts through ARF6 to orchestrate multiple downstream signaling pathways
Signaling pathways stimulated by oncogenic GNAQ include those mediated by PLC-PKC
and Rac/Rho (Feng et al., 2014; Vaque et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012a; Yu et al., 2014).
Knockdown of either ARF6 or GNAQ in uveal melanoma cells resulted in a significant
reduction in PLC activity ranging from 24% to 80% inhibition when using a

phosphoinositide turnover assay (Figure 2A). Consistent with this reduction in PLC activity,
the level of phosphorylated myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (p-MARCKS), a
substrate of PKC, was decreased by ARF6 knockdown (Figures 2B and S2A). Knockdown
of ARF6 or GNAQ also significantly reduced the levels of Rac1-GTP/RhoA-GTP and their
downstream readouts, phosphorylated ERK, p38, JNK, and c-jun (Figures 2C–2E and S2B–
S2G). The reduction of c-jun phosphorylation resulted in decreased AP-1 transcriptional
activity (Figure 2F).

Author Manuscript

Oncogenic GNAQ enhances nuclear YAP activation through Rac1/RhoA, implicating YAP
as a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma (Feng et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014).
Silencing ARF6 or GNAQ inhibited by 60% the nuclear localization of YAP in uveal
melanoma cells, as detected by immunocytofluorescence and subcellular fractionation/
immunoblotting (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2H). mRNA levels of the YAP target genes CYR61
and CTGF were also reduced in Mel92.1 and Mel202 cells in which ARF6 was knocked
down (Figure 2I).

Author Manuscript

The finding that ARF6 is an effector of oncogenic GNAQ that activates multiple signaling
pathways suggested that constitutively active ARF6 (ARF6Q67L) would also activate these
same pathways. Ectopic expression of ARF6Q67L or GNAQQ209L in HEK293T cells induced
the PLC-PKC and MAPK pathways, including the activation of ERK, p38, JNK, and c-jun
and the increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity, YAP nuclear accumulation, and YAPmediated transcription (Figure S2I–S2N). These results show that ARF6 is both necessary
and sufficient, at least in cells expressing endogenous wild-type Gαq proteins, to mediate
GNAQ activity and thus serves as a critical signaling node. However, based on the partial
functional rescue that we achieved with constitutively active ARF6 following GNAQ
knockdown in uveal melanoma cells and previous reports showing that Gαq proteins
directly bind to and activate PLC-β1 (Berstein et al., 1992; Blank et al., 1991), we propose
that activated ARF6 enhances GNAQ signaling and cannot entirely replace it.
GNAQQ209L-activated ARF6 induces β-catenin signaling by increasing β-catenin trafficking
from the plasma membrane to the nucleus

Author Manuscript

Activating mutations in β-catenin are found in many human cancers (Clevers, 2006). Our
previous work showed that in a model of cutaneous melanoma, WNT5A–activated ARF6
promotes the relocalization of β-catenin from the membrane to the nucleus to induce βcatenin-mediated transcription and cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Grossmann et al.,
2013). We therefore examined whether the oncogenic GNAQ-activated ARF6 also increased
the translocation of β-catenin from the membrane to the nucleus in uveal melanoma cells.
Knocking down GNAQ or ARF6 in uveal melanoma cells resulted in an increase in the
membrane pool of β-catenin and a corresponding decrease in the cytosolic and nuclear
pools, as shown by both immunocytofluorescence and subcellular fractionation analyses
(Figure 3A and 3B). These treatments also significantly reduced luciferase activity in a
7TFP-mediated luciferase reporter assay (a measure of β-catenin-mediated transcription)
(Figure 3C). Knockdown of GNAQ and ARF6 did not alter total β-catenin protein levels
(Figure S3A), suggesting that the mechanism that controls β-catenin intracellular
localization by GNAQQ209L-activated ARF6 is independent of the mechanism of β-catenin

stabilization by WNTs. In HEK293T cells, ectopic expression of ARF6Q67L or GNAQQ209L
decreased the membrane pool of β-catenin and concomitantly increased the cytosolic and
nuclear pools of β-catenin (Figure S3B). These same active forms of ARF6 and GNAQ also
increased the activity of a β-catenin responsive luciferase reporter (Figure S3C). Together,
these results show that an oncogenic Gαq protein induces β-catenin signaling and that it
does so through the activation of its effector ARF6, which promotes the relocalization of βcatenin from the plasma membrane to the nucleus.

Author Manuscript

Other investigators have shown that ERK activation induces casein kinase-2 (CK2)-mediated
phosphorylation of α-catenin, which destabilizes adherens junctions and releases β-catenin
from cadherins (Ji et al., 2009; Pellon-Cardenas et al., 2013), and that this activation can be
induced by ARF6 in epithelial cells (Pellon-Cardenas et al., 2013). To determine whether a
similar mechanism drives β-catenin release in uveal melanoma cells, we knocked down
CK2α (the catalytic subunit) and determined the intracellular location of β-catenin by
subcellular fractionation. CK2α knockdown simultaneously increased β-catenin in the
membrane fraction and decreased its localization to the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure
S3D), suggesting that a similar ERK-CK2-α-catenin mechanism may control β-catenin
release from cadherins in uveal melanoma cells.

Author Manuscript

β-catenin signaling can increase cell proliferation in some cancer cells (Clevers, 2006; Reya
and Clevers, 2005). To determine whether β-catenin signaling in uveal melanoma cells
influences cell proliferation, we exposed Mel92.1 and Mel202 cells to two different
inhibitors of β-catenin signaling, XAV-939 and IWR-1-endo (Chen et al., 2009; Huang et al.,
2009). After 72 hours of treatment, both XAV939 and IWR-1-endo inhibited cell
proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with a GI50 (50% growth inhibition) of
around 3 µM and 10 µM, respectively, in both cell lines (Figure S3E). These results suggest
that GNAQQ209L-ARF6-mediated β-catenin signaling plays a role in uveal melanoma cell
proliferation.
Oncogenic GNAQ forms a complex with GEP100 to activate ARF6

Author Manuscript

We next sought to identify the ARF-GEF responsible for oncogenic GNAQ-mediated ARF6
activation. ARNO and GEP100 are known ARF6-GEFs in endothelial cells and in multiple
cancer cells (Grossmann et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2012; Morishige et al., 2008; Zhu et al.,
2012), and both ARF-GEFs are expressed in human uveal melanoma tissues (Figure S4A).
Knockdown of GEP100 (Figure 4A), but not ARNO (Figure S4B), reduced ARF6-GTP
levels by 60% in uveal melanoma cells. Knockdown of GEP100 resulted in 50% inhibition
of cell proliferation and 80% inhibition in anchorage-independent colony growth (Figure 4B
and 4C), mimicking the cellular phenotypes of ARF6 knockdown. Similar to the silencing of
ARF6 and GNAQ, knockdown of GEP100 also inhibited PLC-PKC, Rac1/RhoA, YAP, and
β-catenin signaling, as evidenced by decreased activation of the downstream effectors and
reduced nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of YAP and β-catenin (Figures
S4C–S4L). We hypothesized that oncogenic GNAQ and GEP100 might form a complex that
activates ARF6 in uveal melanoma cells, because such complexes have been shown to occur
following ectopic expression of Gαq and GEP100 in HEK293T cells (Giguere et al., 2006;
Laroche et al., 2007). Immunoprecipitation of GNAQ from uveal melanoma cells harboring

the activating mutation co-precipitated GEP100 (Figure 4D), suggesting the existence of a

ARF6 exerts its effect on constitutive GNAQ signaling by controlling GNAQQ209L
intracellular localization

Author Manuscript

ARF6 has a known role in endocytosis of GPCRs (Chen et al., 2003; Hunzicker-Dunn et al.,
2002), and GPCRs and Gα proteins are known to traffic between the plasma membrane and
early endosomes (Calebiro et al., 2009; Ferrandon et al., 2009; Hynes et al., 2004; Irannejad
et al., 2013; Scarselli and Donaldson, 2009; Van Dyke, 2004; Zheng et al., 2004). To
examine whether ARF6 might control activated GNAQ signaling through a similar protein
trafficking mechanism, we knocked down ARF6 in Mel92.1 and Mel202 cells and assessed
intracellular localization of GNAQ using both immunocytofluorescence and cell
fractionation analysis. Upon ARF6 silencing, there was an increase in GNAQ localized to
the plasma membrane with a concomitant reduction of GNAQ in the cytosol and
cytoplasmic vesicles (Figure 5). GEP100 knockdown likewise exhibited a shift of GNAQ
localization from the cytosol and cytoplasmic vesicles to the plasma membrane (Figure S5A
and S5B). Silencing of other human ARF family members did not cause appreciable
intracellular relocalization of GNAQ (Figure S5C), thus suggesting that this function is
specific to ARF6. Cumulatively, these results suggest that activated ARF6 directs GNAQ to
the cytoplasmic vesicles, leading to an increase in signaling of downstream oncogenic
pathways.
NAV-2729, a direct inhibitor of ARF6, mimics ARF6 knockdown in cell function assays

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our finding that ARF6 acts as an immediate downstream effector of the uveal melanoma
GNAQ/GEP100 complex that controls all of the currently recognized signaling pathways
governed by oncogenic Gαq compelled us to investigate whether chemical inhibitors of
ARF6 activation might provide an effective pharmacologic treatment of uveal melanoma. To
our knowledge, no direct inhibitors of ARF6 have been published or are commercially
available. Therefore, ARF-GEF inhibitors, such as SecinH3, have been used as surrogates
for ARF6 inhibition in past studies (Hafner et al., 2006; Grossmann et al., 2013). However,
ARNO, a target for SecinH3 inhibition, promotes epidermal growth factor receptor
activation independent of its ARF-GEF activity (Bill et al., 2010), so inhibiting ARF-GEFs
rather than ARF6 directly could lead to off-target effects. Therefore, it is imperative to find
direct ARF6 inhibitors that can reduce these unintended consequences. To identify such
inhibitors, a high throughput screen (HTS) based on a fluorometric biochemical assay was
devised to identify chemically tractable, reversible, allosteric inhibitors that target ARF6
directly (Figures 6A and S6A–S6C). The requirement for an allosteric, non-nucleotidecompetitive mode of action was dictated by intracellular concentrations of GTP, which are
approximately 100 µM. A comparative evaluation of more than 20 chemical series and
singleton HTS hits from the DIVERSet-EXP collection (Chuprina et al., 2010) of
approximately 50,000 compounds (ChemBridge) identified the pyrazolopyrimidinone
compound NAV-2729 (Figures 6B and S6) as the most promising ARF6 chemical probe
candidate. This compound was selected for further evaluation based on the following
properties: i) low micromolar potency with IC50 values of 1.0 µM and 3.4 µM determined
using fluorometric and orthogonal radiometric ARF6 nucleotide exchange assays,

respectively (Figure 6C); ii) direct inhibition of ARF6 as evidenced by nearly equipotent
inhibitory effects towards spontaneous and ARF-GEF-catalyzed ARF6 nucleotide exchange
(Figure 6D); iii) a non-nucleotide competitive mechanism supported by the lack of
dependence of inhibitory potency on the nucleotide concentration (Figure 6E); iv) high
selectivity as evidenced by the lack of inhibitory effects for all other human ARF family
members, as well as other small GTPases, such as RhoA, Rac1, H-Ras, and Cdc42 at
NAV-2729 concentrations up to 50 µM (Figure S6D–S6K); v) reversible inhibition (Figure
6F); and vi) overall chemical tractability including apparent lack of commonly recognized
reactive and “frequent hitter” functionalities (Baell and Holloway, 2010).

Author Manuscript

The proposed direct inhibitory mechanism of NAV-2729 agrees well with the results of
molecular docking studies using a structural homology model of the ARF6/ARF-GEF
complex (Figure 6G). The model predicts association of NAV-2729 with ARF6 in its GEFbinding area, which does not overlap with the nucleotide-binding pocket. A hydrogen bond
between the inhibitor carbonyl group and ε-amino group of ARF6 Lys58 residue, as well as
the interaction of its nitrophenyl moiety with a hydrophobic pocket formed by aromatic side
chains of ARF6 residues Phe47, Trp62, Trp74, and Tyr77 make major contributions to the
inhibitor binding energy (Figure S6L). Most importantly, NAV-2729 exhibited a spectrum of
biological activities in uveal melanoma cells that are predicted for an ARF6 inhibitor.
Treatment of Mel92.1 and Mel202 cells with NAV-2729 inhibited ARF6 activation (Figure
6H) and mimicked ARF6 and GEP100 knockdown by driving GNAQ from the cytoplasmic
vesicles to the plasma membrane (Figure 6I and 6J) and reducing anchorage-independent
colony growth (Figure 6K). NAV-2729 also blocked all of the known downstream signaling
pathways of oncogenic GNAQ, including PLC/PKC, Rho/Rac, YAP, and β-catenin (Figure
7).

ARF6 is a potential therapeutic target for oncogenic GNAQ-driven tumors

Author Manuscript

The finding that the activation state of ARF6 regulates multiple oncogenic GNAQ signaling
pathways by controlling the intracellular localization of GNAQQ209L suggested that ARF6
may be a viable therapeutic target for GNAQ-mediated tumorigenesis. We tested this
hypothesis in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of uveal melanoma. Stable uveal
melanoma cells expressing either short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) directed against ARF6 or a
non-specific control sequence were generated by lentiviral infection of Mel202 cells. These
cells were injected into the posterior vitreous chamber of the eyes of immunocompromised
nude mice. Tumor incidence and size were markedly decreased in mice injected with
Mel202 cells expressing ARF6 shRNA compared to mice injected with cells expressing
control shRNA (Figure 8A and 8B). Systemic treatment by intraperitoneal injection of the
direct ARF6 inhibitor NAV-2729 also significantly reduced uveal melanoma tumor
establishment and growth in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model (Figure 8C and 8D). No
signs of toxicity were observed in these studies or in other studies in which the drug was
used at the same dosage (Figure S7, Tables S1–S3). Collectively, these results suggest that
the pharmacological inhibition of ARF6 may represent an effective therapeutic approach to
the treatment of uveal melanoma and possibly other cancers driven by activating Gα
mutations.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Activated oncogenes such as Gα proteins or members of the RAS superfamily of GTPases
act through central signaling nodes that subsequently trigger multiple molecular events that
together induce cancer initiation and invasion (O'Hayre et al., 2014; Pylayeva-Gupta et al.,
2011). Previous studies have shown that activating mutations in either GNAQ or GNA11
promote PLC/PCK and Rac/Rho signaling, leading to both the activation of ERK, p38, JNK,
and YAP and subsequent AP-1- and YAP/TEAD-mediated transcription (Feng et al., 2014;
Vaque et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012b; Yu et al., 2014). In the present study, we have expanded
the number of signaling pathways that are known to be regulated by an activated Gαq
protein to include an ARF6-β-catenin pathway in which activated ARF6 promotes the
release and subsequent translocation of membrane-bound β-catenin to the nucleus where it
induces transcription. By employing biochemical and cellular assays and a newly identified
small molecule inhibitor, we also show that a GNAQQ209L-GEP100 complex activates
ARF6, which functions as an immediate downstream effector to induce the PLC/PKC and
Rho/Rac signaling pathways that lead to AP-1 and YAP/TEAD-mediated transcription
(Figure 8E). Thus, the activation of ARF6 controls all of the currently known oncogenic
pathways mediated by Gαq activating mutations.

Author Manuscript

Our data suggest that activated ARF6 controls GNAQ and β-catenin signaling by regulating
protein trafficking between intracellular compartments. Oncogenic GNAQ forms a protein
complex with GEP100, which activates ARF6 to promote the redistribution of cell surface
GNAQ to cytoplasmic vesicles. GNAQ signaling appears to primarily occur in these
vesicles, because knockdown of ARF6 or GEP100 or chemical inhibition of ARF6 induces
the relocalization of GNAQ from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane with a concomitant
decrease in signaling of all GNAQ-mediated pathways. Palmitoylation of GNAQ may
contribute to its association with cellular membranes (Wedegaertner et al., 1993). Although
signaling from G proteins such as Gα and RAS proteins have traditionally been thought to
occur only at the plasma membrane, more recent studies have challenged this view,
suggesting that signaling can also derive from cytoplasmic vesicles (Calebiro et al., 2009;
Fehrenbacher et al., 2009; Ferrandon et al., 2009; Hancock, 2003; Hynes et al., 2004;
Irannejad et al., 2013; Irannejad and von Zastrow, 2014; Scarselli and Donaldson, 2009; Van
Dyke, 2004; Vilardaga et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2004). Our data agree with these recent
studies but unexpectedly suggest that most of the signaling from active GNAQ in uveal
melanoma emanates from cytoplasmic vesicles rather than the plasma membrane. These
results, coupled with previous work suggesting that maximal oncogenic H-RAS signaling
requires endocytosis and endocytic recycling (Roy et al., 2002), suggest that the intracellular
location of an oncogene may determine its level of activity and that blocking the trafficking
of an oncogene to its primary signaling center may effectively diminish its activity. In the
case of GNAQ and H-RAS, the primary signaling center appears to be in cytoplasmic
vesicles. The activation of ARF6 by oncogenic GNAQ also leads to the release of β-catenin
from the plasma membrane and its subsequent transportation to the nucleus where it induces
gene transcription and helps to promote uveal melanoma cell proliferation. This result is
consistent with our previous study in cutaneous melanoma, which demonstrated a similar

relocalization of β-catenin and increased β-catenin-mediated transcription following
stimulation of the FZD4/LRP6 co-receptor complex with WNT5A (Grossmann et al., 2013).
Our discovery that ARF6 is an immediate downstream effector of the GNAQQ209L-GEP100
complex suggests that targeting ARF6 with a single small molecule may inhibit all of the
currently known Gαq-mediated oncogenic signaling pathways. The necessity and
sufficiency of ARF6 activation in orchestrating activated Gαq oncogenic signaling also
reveals a strategy to blunt cancer initiation and progression, not just tumor invasion and
metastasis. We provide evidence that ARF6 is an actionable node suitable for further
development as a therapeutic target by identifying a direct inhibitor of ARF6 that reduces
tumor establishment and growth in a xenograft model of uveal melanoma.

Uveal melanoma is a devastating cancer and serves as the prototype for activated Gα
protein-mediated cancers. Current treatment relies on surgery and radiation for localized
disease, but there is no effective systemic therapy for advanced disease (Harbour, 2012). The
identification of ARF6 as a signaling partner of GNAQ, offers a target for treatment
regimens that has implications extending beyond Gαq proteins and uveal melanoma to other
cancers harboring activated Gα oncogenes, such as pancreatic and biliary cancers (O'Hayre
et al., 2013). Directly targeting certain oncogenes, e.g., activated RAS GTPase, has been
challenging (Spiegel et al., 2014; Stephen et al., 2014), although recent advances have been
made (Lim et al., 2014; Ostrem et al., 2013). Approaches that individually inhibit each arm
of an activated oncogenic pathway have been adopted but are inefficient, spurring interest in
combination trials as an alternate approach (Thompson, 2013). By illuminating how a
specific activated Gα oncogene orchestrates multiple divergent downstream signaling arms
through a single effector, our work suggests that targeting such primary nodal points in the
signaling pathways of other GTPases could provide an effective method for combatting
oncogenesis and tumor establishment.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Detailed protocols for each of the sections below can be found in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures section of Supplemental Information.
Cell lines, proliferation assay, and anchorage-independent colony growth assay

Author Manuscript

Mel92.1 and Mel202 uveal melanoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293T cells were purchased from ATCC and
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cell proliferation assays were
performed using CyQUANT (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Anchorage-independent colony growth was quantified by the CytoSelect 96-Well Cell
Transformation Assay (Cell Biolabs) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA interference, plasmids, transfections, lentiviral transduction, and qRT-PCR
siRNA duplexes (20 nmol) were transfected into uveal melanoma cells using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The coding regions for GNAQ and GNAQQ209L (Missouri S&T
cDNA Resource Center) were cloned into pcDNA3.1 for N-terminal MYC-tagging.
HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). Mel202 cells were

transduced with lentiviruses expressing ARF6 shRNA (Sigma) and selected for stable
expression. Rescue experiments were performed as described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures. qRT-PCR was performed with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT and QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen).
ARF6/RhoA/Rac1 pull-downs, immunoblots, immunoprecipitation, cell fractionation, PLC
assay, luciferase assay, and immunofluorescence staining

Author Manuscript

ARF6-GTP pull-downs were performed with Arf6 Activation Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs) and
Rac1/RhoA-GTP pull-downs were prepared with Rac1 Activation Assay Kit/RhoA
Activation Assay Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (Grossmann et al., 2013). For
immunoblotting, primary antibodies were diluted in 5% NFDM or 5% BSA in PBS or TBS
plus 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plasma membrane or total membrane
fraction was isolated with Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Abcam) and cytosolic/
nuclear fractions were prepared with NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents
(Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All antibodies for
immunoblots, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytofluorescence staining are listed in table
format in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Scanning densitometry was used for
immunoblot quantification. β-catenin- and AP-1-mediated transcriptional activities in uveal
melanoma cells were assayed using lentivirally transduced cells that stably express the
TOPflash-based 7TFP luciferase reporter (Addgene) (Fuerer and Nusse, 2010) or AP-1
luciferase reporter (QIAGEN). PLC activity was determined using phosphoinositide
turnover assay as described by others (Vaque et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

For immunofluorescence staining studies, Mel202 and Mel92.1 cells were transfected with
ARF6, GNAQ, and control siRNAs and later fixed with formalin and then thoroughly
washed with TBS. The fixed cells were treated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in
TBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Saponin. Cells were washed and secondary Alexafluorconjugated secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were
washed, DAPI anti-Fade medium was added, and randomly selected fields were imaged at
1200x on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope.
Human uveal melanoma patient samples
These studies were done in accordance with a protocol approved by the University of Miami
Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Primary
human uveal melanoma samples were collected at the time of enucleation as previously
described (Onken et al., 2007).

collected and treated for histology by a board certified pathologist who was blinded to
treatment groups.
Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification
His-tagged proteins were purified from bacterial cultures to apparent homogeneity as
described (Grossmann et al., 2013). ARF6 was converted to the GDP-bound form.
Toxicity Studies
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Fluorometric Nucleotide Exchange Assay

Author Manuscript

GDP to GTP exchange on ARF6 and other small GTPases was monitored in a 96-well
format high-throughput screen (HTS) using GTP-BODIPY FL (Life Technologies) by
measuring increases in fluorescence intensity on a plate reader (excitation 490 nm and
emission 520 nm). A DIVERSet-EXP library of compounds (ChemBridge) was used at 10
µM. The selectivity panel included 8 other N-terminally-tagged small GTPases that were
produced in-house or purchased from Cytoskeleton.
Radiometric Nucleotide Exchange Assay
HTS hits were confirmed using radiometric assay for ARF6 nucleotide exchange in an assay
mix similar to the used in the fluorometric nucleotide exchange assay, except that 50 nM
[35S]-GTPγS (2µCi/ml) replaced GTP-BODIPY FL.
Synthetic Methods

Author Manuscript

See Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Molecular Modeling
Molecular modeling was performed using program package ICM-Pro (MolSoft, LLS, San
Diego, CA) with the crystal structure of ARF1 (18–181)-GDP—ARNO—brefeldin A
(Protein Data Bank ID 1S9D) (Renault et al., 2003) being used as a template to build the
ARF6 (14–175) structures.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0f. t-tests, multiple
comparisons tests, nonparametric tests, and 95% confidence intervals were employed as
appropriate.

Highlights
•

ARF6 is an immediate downstream effector of an activated GNAQ/
GEP100 complex

•

ARF6 acts as a node for all downstream signaling pathways induced by
oncogenic GNAQ

•

Maximal signaling occurs when GNAQ is shuttled to cytoplasmic
vesicles

•

Targeting nodes such as ARF6 provide an approach for treating
recalcitrant cancers

SIGNIFICANCE
Activating mutations in G proteins, such as Gαq and RAS, drive oncogenesis in many
cancers by triggering multiple downstream signaling pathways. However, these G
proteins have proven elusive to therapeutic targeting and therefore most efforts have
targeted each divergent pathway individually, thereby blocking only a subset of the
critical pathways. We found that oncogenic GNAQ, a Gαq protein, induces its multiple
signaling pathways through a single node—the small GTPase ARF6. Blocking ARF6
with a small molecule inhibitor reduces tumorigenesis in a mouse model of uveal
melanoma. These results suggest that targeting proximal signaling nodes, rather than their
upstream oncogenes or multiple downstream effectors, may be an effective strategy for
treating cancers driven by recalcitrant oncogenes.
