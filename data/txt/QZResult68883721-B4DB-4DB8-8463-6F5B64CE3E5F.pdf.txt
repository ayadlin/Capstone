ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, controlling
angiogenesis is a promising strategy in cancer treatment. However, thus farther
severe side effects of anti-angiogenic drugs have been rather demonstrated,
stimulating interest in seeking novel targets of anti-angiogenesis. Neurokinin
receptors, also known as tachykinin receptors, are usually considered as drug targets
due to diverse physiological functions and their tractability. Although Neurokinin B,
the selective natural agonist of neurokinin-3 receptor, have been shown to exhibit
anti-angiogenesis activity, the effect and mechanism of neurokinin-3 receptormediated angiogenesis still remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated
that [Mephe7]NKB, an analogue of NKB, possess significant anti-angiogenic effect on
CAM. Furthermore, by introducing the tumor angiogenesis homing sequence (NGR),
we designed and synthesized two novel agonist analogues of NK3R, NK3R-A1 and
NK3R-A2. Both of the two analogues exhibit more efficient anti-migration effect on
HUVECs by activating NK3R in vitro, and showed potent antitumor activities with no
significant side effects in vivo. Taken together, our results illuminated that NK3R
might be a potential novel target for the anti-angiogenesis therapy. Notably, NK3R-A1
might be used as a template for the development of the anti-tumor drugs on the basis
of the anti-angiogenesis strategy.

INTRODUCTION

inhibitors or occur severe side effect, such as bleeding
and chemoresistance [4–7]. The limitation of current antiangiogenic strategies stimulate our interests in finding
novel targets for anti-angiogenesis therapy.
Tachykinin receptors, known as neurokinin (NK)
receptors, are usually considered therapeutically important
due to diverse physiological functions and their tractability
as drug targets [8, 9]. Neurokinin B (NKB), the most
potent natural agonist ligand for NK3 receptor (NK3R),
has been reported to play a vital role in many potentially
life threatening disease. Pal et al. demonstrated that
NKB could target endothelium via a multi-component
mechanism to oppose vascular remodeling and act as an
endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor [10]. Thus, we proposed
a hypothesis that NK3R might function as a potential

Since the importance of angiogenesis in tumor
development has been recognized over decades [1],
interest in the therapeutic potential of anti-angiogenic
treatments has continued to grow [2]. The most
validated anti-angiogenic strategies act on the VEGF
axis, blocking VEGF directly with the neutralizing
antibody bevacizumab or the aflibercept (VEGF trap),
or indirectly with low-molecular-weight tyrosine kinase
VEGF receptor inhibitors (e.g., sunitinib, sorafenib, and
pazopanib) [3]. Nonetheless, clinical applications have
not got the expected results, only a fraction of cancer
patients show benefit as tumors evolve mechanisms of
resistance or are refractory toward VEGF (receptor)

novel target for the anti-angiogenesis therapy through the
interactions with agonist and analogues of NK3R.
Agonist binding to the receptor is a critical key in
initiating signaling and triggering effects, therefore the
declaration of structural features of the agonists not only
can reveal the molecular basis of receptor activation but
also will help in rational design of novel therapeutics. The
pharmacology of the NK3R is less well characterized in
comparison of NK1 and NK2 receptors. Several agonists
derived for the NK3R have been obtained by modification
of the primary structure of NKB [11]. [MePhe7]NKB, a
classical synthetic agonist, has been used extensively to
study the role of NK3R and [Gly6]NKB[3-10] has been
used to facilitate the study of putative NK3R antagonists
[12, 13]. Studies with chimeric NK1/NK3 receptors have
identified that the carboxyl terminal domain, part of the
third extracellular loop and the seventh transmembrane
region of the NK3R, is important for NKB binding [14].
Therefore, in order to maintain maximal binding stability
and reinforce the affinity with the NK3R, we kept the
NKB[4-10] motif and replaced Val7 with MePhe7.
On the other hand, we considered to bring in
additional motif to reinforce tumor targeting effect of
analogues of NK3R agonist. A critical component of
molecular targeting is the identification of a marker, for
instance angiogenic or “activated” endothelium. Novel
markers of angiogenic endothelium and their ligands have
been identified by various phage display experiments in
tumor models. NGR (Asn-Gly-Arg) have been shown to
home specifically to tumor vessels in tumor xenograft
bearing mice [15]. In addition, NGR conjugated peptides
showed a greater anti-tumor effect than uncoupled drugs
[16, 17]. The vascular address for NGR has been identified
as CD13/APN (aminopeptidase N, also named CD13),
which was found to be target for anti-cancerous therapy
because of its functional association with the growth
of different human cancers. APN could function as the
dominating receptor for the NGR peptide motif and this
receptor is expressed exclusively on the endothelial cells
of tumor vessels in the subsequent research [18–20].
In particular, NGR and Cysteine-asparagine–glycine–
arginine-cysteine (CNGRC), which was derived from
NGR peptide, have been proven to be useful for delivering
cytotoxic drugs, proapoptotic peptides, and tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF) to tumor vasculature.
Here, our result showed that the agonist of NK3R,
[MePhe7]NKB, could elicit significant anti-angiogenic
effect in vitro and in vivo. Two novel analogues,
NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2, were designed by coupling
the targeting anti-tumor motif NGR/CNGRC and the
NK3R high affinity binding sequence with a glycinyglycine (GG) bridge to impart peptide flexibility and
minimize potential steric interactions that would prevent
binding. Further functional assay indicated that the NK3R
analogues exhibit more efficient anti-migration effect than
[MePhe7]NKB on HUVECs by activating NK3R in vitro,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and showed no significant side effects on potent antitumor
activities in vivo. Taken together, our results illuminated
that NK3R might be a potential novel target for the antiangiogenesis therapy. Notably, the modified molecular
modeling of the most effective analogue, NK3R-A1,
might provide novel insight into the development of antitumor drugs on the basis of the anti-angiogenesis strategy.

RESULTS
The anti-angiogenic effect mediated by activating
NK3R on CAM
CAM assays were conducted to access whether
NKB possess the anti-angiogenic property through its
putative receptor, NK3R. Compared to the controls,
1μM of NKB significantly reduced vascular density
and bed area to 38.6% and 20.9%, respectively
(Figure 1A–1C). [Gly6]NKB [3–10], selective antagonist of
NK3R, was used for antagonism assay. We found [Gly6]NKB
[3-10] could dramatically antagonize the effects of NKB
to reduce the density of capillary and bed area of the
chorioallantois microvessels, while showed no effects
alone (Figure 1A, 1D–1E). Our results suggested that NKB
possess the anti-angiogenic effect through activating NK3R.

Selective agonist analogues of NK3R exert antiangiogenic property on CAM through NK3R
To examine if NK3R could be an effective target for
anti-angiogenic strategy, one efficient agonist of NK3R,
[MePhe7]NKB and two novel designed analogues of NK3R
agonist, NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2 were estimated in CAM
assay (Figure 2A). [MePhe7]NKB inhibited the expansion
of the microvasculature by ~30% at a dose of 50 nM
(Figure 2B–2C). Meanwhile, 100 nM of NK3R-A1
and NK3R-A2 remarkably reduced vascular density to
48.4% and 31.6%, and vascular bed area descended to
53.8% and 30.7%, compare to PBS control, respectively
(Figure 2D–2E). As we demonstrated earlier, the antiangiogenic effect of NKB was triggered through NK3R. By
pre-treatment with [Gly6]NKB[3-10], the anti-angiogenic
effects of [MePhe7]NKB and two novel designed
analogues, were all blocked on CAM in vascular densities
and bed areas (Figure 2F–2G). These results indicated that
NK3R interaction with all three peptides appear to mediate
the blockade of angiogenesis in the CAM assay.
To confirm that our designed peptides indeed
possess the property of anti-angiogenesis, especially for
neovascularization at microscopic level on histological
sections, we further performed gelatin sponge-CAM assay
(shown in Figure 2H). Treating with 50 nM [MePhe7]NKB,
100 nM NK3R-A1 or100 nM NK3R-A2 respectively, the
number of new vessels were decreased dramatically. The
antagonist of NK3R, [Gly6]NKB[3-10], which did not
exhibit obvious anti-angiogenic effect alone, was found

to antagonize the anti-angiogenic effects of [MePhe7]
NKB, NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2. All the data confirmed
that [MePhe7]NKB and our novel designed peptides,
NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2, can induce the suppression of
neovascularization in the NK3R-dependent manner.

HUVECs that were treated with [MePhe7]NKB, NK3R-A1
and NK3R-A2 for 24 hours (Data not shown).
In contrast, the peptides exhibit significant affect
on the migration ability of HUVECs. Figure 3A–3B
shows the results of the migration of HUVECs toward a
pseudo-wound inflicted on a monolayer of cells at 0- and
24-hours, respectively. The results revealed that NK3R
agonist analogues significantly decrease the closure rate
of the wounded area. At around 24 hs post wounding,
> 50% of the wounded areas still remain unclosed of the
NK3R-A1 or NK3R-A2 treated group (Figure 3A–3B), while
the wound area of control group nearly complete closed.
In parallel, anti-migration effects of peptides were
further demonstrated in Transwell migration assay. At
12 hours after seeding, the numbers of migrated HUVECs

NK3R-A1, NK3R-A2 and [MePhe7]NKB could
suppress the migration of HUVECs in vitro
We next detected the anti-angiogenic effect of peptides
in vitro. Given the importance of proliferation and mobility of
HUVECs for neovascularization, MTT, wound healing and
Transwell migration assays were conducted to further explore
the effects of the peptides on HUVECs. In MTT assay, there
is no markedly inhibition effects on the proliferation of

of NK3R-A1 or NK3R-A2 (5 μM) treated group were
4- and 9-fold less than the control group, respectively
(Figure 3C–3E). All the results elucidated that NK3R-A1,
NK3R-A2 and [MePhe7]NKB possessed the property of antimigration in vitro, and two NK3R agonists analogues showed
profound inhibitory effect than that of [MePhe7]NKB.

suggest that NK3R is crucial for the anti-angiogenic
activity of the peptides, which means NK3R might be the
main target of these testing peptides to drive the function
of anti-angiogenesis.

Antitumor activity of the agonist analogues in
S180 sarcoma-bearing BALB/c mice

NK3R antagonist [Gly6]NKB[3-10] could
antagonize the anti-angiogenic effect induced by
the analogues in vitro

To characterize the in vivo anti-angiogenic activities
of the agonist analogues against tumor, S180 sarcoma
cells were harvested in BALB/c mice and antitumor
properties were analyzed. Experimental results indicated
that tumor volume gap between peptides treated and NS
control animals progressively increased. And at the end
of the experiment, tumor volume of peptides treated
groups were over 2 times smaller than those of the
control, which illustrated that three agonist analogues of
NK3R did counteract the tumor growth in S180 tumorbearing mice without markedly changes of body weight
(Figure 5A–5C). As shown in Figure 5D–5E, the tumor
weights of the peptides-treated groups were significantly
decreased as compared to the negative control. The
IHC staining results (Figure 5F–5G) showed that the
microvessel density (MVD) of stained tissues were overtly
decreased than that of negative control, which illustrated
that the peptides possess anti-angiogenesis activity in vivo.
In sum, all the results indicated that both NK3R-A1 and

[Gly6]NKB[3-10], specific antagonist of NK3R,
was used to further declare the mechanism of the antiangiogenesis effects of the tested peptides. The closure
of the wound areas of cells that treated with [Gly6]
NKB[3-10] 1 hour before adding NK3R-A1 or NK3R-A2
were nearly complete, reached to ~90% after 24 hours
(Figure 4A–4C). Moreover, the anti-migration activity of
[MePhe7]NKB was also significantly suppressed by [Gly6]
NKB[3-10] (Figure 4A and 4D).
The antagonist of NK3R countervailed the inhibition
effect of all agonist analogues of NK3R, which was able to
be further verified in Transwell migration assay. Pretreated
with [Gly6]NKB[3-10] 1h before adding either NK3R-A1,
NK3R-A2 or [MePhe7]NKB, the number of migrated cells
dramatically increased than that of the [Gly6]NKB[3-10]
non-treated group (Figure 4E–4H). These findings strongly

Our findings suggested that NK3R might be a novel
potential target for the anti-angiogenesis strategy. The
anti-angiogenic peptide NK3R-A1 could be used as an
template for the development of novel anti-tumor drugs.
Tumor angiogenesis is a complicated process
that perturbed the balance between pro-angiogenic and
anti-angiogenic mechanisms [21]. During the last three
decades, numerous cytokines have been proven to be
crucial for tumor related angiogenesis through mediating

DISCUSSION
In our present work, we proposed a tactics to
design analogues of NK3R agonist which has the antiangiogenesis activity targeting to the blood vessels of
tumors. The results demonstrated that the anti-angiogenic

vasculogenesis, angiogenic remodeling, angiogenic
sprouting, and vascular permeability, VEGF is wellknown among them [22, 23]. However, with the deepening
of the investigations, some limitations of VEGFrelated antibodies have been exposed. Bevacizumab in
combination with bolus-IFL chemotherapy could increase
the risk of suffering gastrointestinal perforation [24].
Ebos JM et al. showed that sunitinib, the VEGFR/PDGFR
kinase inhibitor, could accelerate metastatic tumor growth
and decrease overall survival in mice after receiving short-

term therapy in various metastasis assays [25]. Thus, it
is essential to find some novel targets to extend the antiangiogenic strategy.
NK3R, member of tachykinins receptors, is a class
A GPCR preferentially activated by NKB peptide, which
together with senktide (a synthetic peptide) are the only
known potent and selective agonists of NK3R [26].
Numerous studies indicated that the function of NK3R
related to tachykinins exert a plethora of biological effects,
including smooth muscle contraction and relaxation,

vasodilatation, secretion, activation of the immune
system, pain transmission and neurogenic inflammation,
and are implicated in a broad range of CNS disorders
[27, 28]. Here, we described further evidence that NKB
could function as an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor.
Our results also provided novel evidence that the antiangiogenesis of NKB and its analogues were elicited by
activating NK3R, suggesting that NK3R might be a novel
potential target for anti-angiogenesis therapeutics.
[MePhe7]NKB, another efficient active agonist
of NK3R by replacing Val7 of NKB with MePhe, has
been utilized in our investigation. We demonstrated that
[MePhe7]NKB which exert even more efficient antiangiogenic effect compared with NKB on CAM assay
and gelatin sponge-CAM assay. And the corresponding
competitive assay we performed using the antagonist
of NK3R, [Gly6]NKB[3-10], showed that it almost
completely antagonize the effects of both peptides. In
consideration that NKB[4-10], which has been found to be
the minimum active sequence of NKB [29], also elicited
significant anti-angiogenesis effect in CAM assay (data
not shown), [MePhe7]NKB[4-10] was therefore singled
out for the designation of these two agonist analogues of
NK3R, NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2.
In addition, due to the NK3R is widely distribution,
it is necessary to restrict the target selectivity of NK3R and

its analogues to the tumor angiogenesis area. Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) and Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR)are two peptide motifs
have been well characterized with known recognition sites
among various peptides identified through phage-display
to target the tumor vessels of a mouse model. NGR was
found to bind the aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) receptor
isoform that is upregulated in tumor vasculature, and shows
a three-fold higher specificity than the RGD peptide toward
tumor area [19, 20]. In addition, as an endothelial cellsurface receptor of NGR sequence, APN is concentrated on
the apical surface of forming blood vessels and is absent
or barely detectable in established blood vessels [30].
Colombo and co-workers have confirmed the affinity to its
receptor and antitumor activity of linear peptide CNGRC
could be lower than that of cyclic peptide c(CNGRC),
demonstrating that the disulfide bridge constraint was vital
for stabilizing the bent conformation and for increasing the
tumor targeting efficiency [31]. With these advantages, the
NGR peptide-based drug delivery and imaging studies have
been an emerging strategy in anticancer research [32, 33].
To extend the function of NK3R agonists serving
as a valid inhibitor of angiogenesis with the selectivity
targeting property to the tumor related angiogenesis
site, two endothelial cells targeting sequence, NGR and
CNGRC, were used to construct novel anti-angiogenic
peptide analogues. A GG bridge were utilized to couple

the two functional motifs including the tumor vascular
recognition sequence NGR or CNGRC, and the antiangiogenesis sequence of NK3R agonist to impart peptide
flexibility and minimize potential steric interactions that
would prevent binding [17]. Our results of in vitro and
CAM assay indicated that the designed two peptides
approximately retain the function of [MePhe7]NKB and
showed even more visible anti-angiogenic effects in vitro
experiments, which might embody the GG bridge linker
maintain the structure of two functional domains. Our
results in vivo showed that all peptides showed potent
antitumor effects without severe toxic effect that which
suggested by the finding that the body weight of peptides
treated mice did not significantly altered. Meanwhile,
NK3R-A1 exert more overt anti-tumor effect than that
of NK3R-A2 and [MePhe7]NKB, suggesting that agonist
analogues of NK3R conjugated with NGR motifs indeed
have an advantage over [MePhe7]NKB on anti-tumor
effects and the disulfide bridge of c(CNGRC) might not
be well established, more pharmacokinetics experiments
are ongoing.

In conclusion, these results indicated that the
complex of NGR or CNGRC and the NK3R agonist
are successful for eliciting anti-angiogenic effect. They
might open a new gate leading to the anti-angiogenesis
targeting therapy. Otherwise, our competition assays also
demonstrated the anti-angiogenesis activities of peptides
are depending on the activation of NK3R. Our work also
proved that NGR-GG-DFF(MeF)GLM- NH2 could serve
as a novel valued template for the development of antiangiogenesis drug against cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

flank (day 0). Seventy-two hours after inoculation, forty mice with S180 cells were randomly divided into eight groups. Peptides were
continuously administrated intravenously by tails for 14 days (0.1 ml/10 g, once a day): group 1 with NS (negative control), group 2 with
cyclophosphamide (CTX, positive control), groups 3 and 4 were injected with peptide [MePhe7]NKB (0.2 and 1 mg/kg, respectively),
groups 5 and 6 were injected with peptide NK3R-A1 (0.2 and 1 mg/kg, respectively), groups 7 and 8 were injected with peptide NK3R-A2
(0.2 and 1 mg/kg, respectively). All mice were sacrificed after 24 h of the last administration, and the tumor tissues were excised and
weighed. (B) The growth curves of the tumor were recorded with a caliper and the tumor volume was measured every two day according to

antagonist, [Gly6]NKB[3-10], was administrated 1 hour
before adding agonists. Images of migrated cells were
taken using an inverted microscope at 100 × magnification
after every 6h of incubation in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2 at 37°C. The pictures were taken from three
randomly selected fields and analyzed by Image J.

Animals and cell lines
Female BALB/c mice, aged 5–8 weeks (18 ± 2 g),
were purchased from Henan Academy of Medical and
Pharmaceutical Science (Certificate No. SCXK (Yu)
2011–0010, Henan, China). The animals had free access to
food and water in cages that were maintained in a pathogenfree environment (24 ± 0.8°C, humidity of 55 ± 5%)
with a 12 hours light/dark cycle. All animal experimental
procedures were approved by Zhengzhou University
committee for animal experiments. Human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and murine sarcoma
S180 cell line were maintained in our laboratory. All cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, USA) with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Transwell migration assay
The Transwell migration assay is a commonly
used test to assess the migratory response of endothelial
cells to angiogenic inducers or inhibitors. The effect
of peptides [MePhe7]NKB, NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2
(1, 5, 25, 100 μM) on HUVECs migration was performed
using a Transwell system (BD, USA) with pore size of
8.0 μm as described previously [34]. Five random views
of successfully migrated cells were photographed and
quantified under an inverted microscope. The competitive
antagonism assay was conducted by using [Gly6]NKB[3-10].

Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay

Cell viability assay

The CAM assay was carried out as described with
slight modifications according to the procedure described
by Le Noble FA et al previously [35]. 1 μM of [Gly6]
NKB[3-10] were added to eggs 1 hour before adding the
agonist to validate the anti-angiogenic role of peptides.
Pictures were disposed with picture soft (NIS-Elements
Basic Research, Nikon Corporation, Japan). The antiangiogenesis effect was calculated using the following
equation : [( Vessel Number of CAM treated by drug/
(Vessel number of CAM treated by PBS)] ×100% = %
relative rate of vascular density. [(Vessel area of CAM
treated by drug/(Vessel area of CAM treated by PBS)]
×100% = % relative rate of vascular area.

HUVECs were used to evaluate the effects
of different concentrations of peptides [MePhe7]
NKB, NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2. The effects of
peptides (5, 25, 100 μM) on cell proliferation were
determined by a quantitative colorimetric assay with
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT).

The gelatin sponge –CAM assay
The gelatin sponge-CAM assay was performed as
previously described by Ritabbi D [36]. Briefly, sterilized
gelatin sponges (Fukang Medical Devices Co. Ltd, Guilin,
China) containing peptides were implanted onto CAM on
day 8 of incubation. Embryos and membranes were fixed
and cut in ovo after 48 h treated with peptides. Samples
were sent to Servicebio Technology Company (Wuhan,
China) to conduct special staining. The stained CAM
tissues were observed by an inverted microscope (400 ×).

The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Mice Treatment
The bearing mice model of S180 cells were
performed following the protocol described previously [37].
Mice were injected (i.h.) with 2 × 106 S180 cells at day 0. 24
hours later, [MePhe7]NKB, NK3R-A1 and NK3R-A2 (0.2
or 1 mg/kg/d) was administered by the intravenous (i.v.)
route for 14 days. Mice were administered Normal Saline
(NS) or CTX (25 mg/kg/d; Sigma-Aldrich, Rome, Italy) as
negative control and positive control, respectively. Positive
control group were i.v. administered 25 mg/kg/d for two
weeks. The tumor volumes were monitored every two days,
and primary tumor volumes were calculated by the formula
V = a × b2/2, where “a” is the longest dimension parallel
to the skin surface and “b” is the dimension perpendicular
to “a” and parallel to the surface. All mice were sacrificed
after 24 hours of the last administration, and the tumor
tissues were excised and weighed.

Immunohistochemical staining
The anti-CD31 antibody (bs-0195R) was purchased
from Bioss Company (Beijing, China) and used according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tumor tissues were
sent to pathology of Zhengzhou Yihe hospital to stain. The
stained sample tissues were observed under an inverted
microscope (200 ×) using the method of Weidner [38].

Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean ± SEM. The statistical
significances of difference between each group were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Statistical differences were presented at probability levels
of *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
