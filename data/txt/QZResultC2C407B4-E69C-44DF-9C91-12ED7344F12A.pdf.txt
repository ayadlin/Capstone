Abstract
PTPN6 (SHP1) is a tyrosine phosphatase that negatively controls the activity of
multiple signaling pathways including STAT signaling, however role of mutated PTPN6
is not much known. Here we investigated whether PTPN6 might also be a potential
target for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and performed Sanger sequencing
of the PTPN6 gene. We have identified missense mutations within PTPN6 (N225K and
A550V) in 5% (2/38) of DLBCL tumors. Site directed mutagenesis was performed
to mutate wild type (WT) PTPN6 and stable cell lines were generated by lentiviral
transduction of PTPN6WT, PTPN6N225K and PTPN6A550V constructs, and effects of WT
or mutated PTPN6 on STAT3 signaling were analyzed. WT PTPN6 dephosphorylated
STAT3, but had no effect on STAT1, STAT5 or STAT6 phosphorylation. Both PTPN6
mutants were unable to inhibit constitutive, as well as cytokines induced STAT3
activation. Both PTPN6 mutants also demonstrated reduced tyrosine phosphatase
activity and exhibited enhanced STAT3 transactivation activity. Intriguingly, a lack
of direct binding between STAT3 and WT or mutated PTPN6 was observed. However,
compared to WT PTPN6, cells expressing PTPN6 mutants exhibited increased
binding between JAK3 and PTPN6 suggesting a more dynamic interaction of PTPN6
with upstream regulators of STAT3. Consistent with this notion, both the mutants
demonstrated increased resistance to JAK3 inhibitor, WHIP-154 relative to WT
PTPN6. Overall, this is the first study, which demonstrates that N225K and A550V
PTPN6 mutations cause loss-of-function leading to JAK3 mediated deregulation of
STAT3 pathway and uncovers a mechanism that tumor cells can use to control PTPN6
substrate specificity.

activation of the catalytic domain and the subsequent
dephosphorylation of the substrate.[5] Loss of function of
PTPN6 in murine models has been previously described
as a driver of autoimmune diseases.[6-8] Motheaten mice
carrying the autosomal recessive motheaten (Ptpn6me) and
viable motheaten (Ptpn6me-v) mutations were shown to
develop immunodeficiency and several pathophysiological
abnormalities.[7-9] In this study we investigated
PTPN6 mutations in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and
characterized their role in deregulation of STAT3 signaling

PTPN6, also known as SHP1, is a ubiquitously
expressed SH2 domain-containing PTP.[1-3] In humans,
the PTPN6 gene is encoded by 17 exons and has 2
promoter regions.[4] PTPN6 1A (or P1) is the longer
region and is expressed primarily in non-hematopoietic
cells, whereas the shorter region, PTPN6 1B (or P2)
is expressed only in cells of hematopoietic lineage.
[1, 2, 4] PTPN6 contains two Src-homology 2 domains

accounting for about 30% of newly diagnosed cases in
the United States.[10] Although most patients achieve
complete remission in response to the current frontline
therapy, R-CHOP, approximately 40% of patients fail to
respond to initial treatment and eventually die of disease.
[11] So far, many signal transduction pathways have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of DLBCL such as the BCR
signaling, [12] NF-κB [13], [14] and mTOR pathways.
Furthermore, high expression of STAT3 protein in DLBCL
tumors as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has
been associated with unfavorable outcome in some, [15]
but not all studies.[16-18] In addition, previous studies
have demonstrated deregulation of JAK/STAT3 signaling
in DLBCL.[16, 19, 20].
The mechanism of aberrant STAT3 activation
in cancer is not well understood. Several potential
causes have been suggested and studied including
deregulated cytokine secretion (e.g. IL-10), [21] gain
of function mutations, [22-24] and loss of negative
regulators of JAK/STAT signaling such as SOCS1[2527] and protein tyrosine phosphatases.[28, 29] Protein
tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) are important enzymes that
negatively regulate the activity of multiple signaling
pathways downstream of tyrosine kinases including the
Janus kinases.[1, 30, 31] However, the role of PTPN6
mutations in the regulation of STAT signaling has not
previously been described in DLBCL. The present study
was designed to evaluate the functional significance of
PTPN6 mutations on STAT signaling.

mutations did not affect expression or stability of PTPN6
at the protein level (Figure 1B). Interestingly, both mutants
demonstrated reduction of tyrosine phosphatase activity as
compared to PTPN6WT (Figure 1C), suggesting that these
PTPN6 mutations are loss of function mutations.

As tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for
STAT signaling and since PTPs are important negative
regulators of the pathway, [32] we examined the effect of
PTPN6N225K and PTPN6A550V mutations on STAT1, STAT3,
STAT5 and STAT6 constitutive phosphorylation in stably
transfected PTPN6 mutant and WT cell lines. Western
blot analysis showed that while overexpression of WT
PTPN6 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation as compared to
cells with empty vector, cells expressing PTPN6 mutants
maintained STAT3 phosphorylation comparable to the

Results
Identification of PTPN6 mutations in DLBCL
tumors
To identify the PTPN6 mutations, DNA from 38
DLBCL tumor samples was sequenced bidirectionally.
All exons of PTPN6 gene were amplified and analyzed
by Sanger sequencing. Two novel heterozygous missense
mutations were identified in 2 separate patient tumors. The
first mutation was located in exon 7 and resulted in an
Asparagine to Lysine substitution at codon 225 (N225K).
The second missense mutation found, in exon 15, resulted
in Alanine to Valine substitution at codon 550 (A550V)
(Figure 1A). The locations of the N225K and A550V
mutations are depicted in the modular structure of the
PTPN6 gene (S1). Alignment analysis showed that the
human N225 asparagine and the A550 alanine amino acids
of the PTPN6 protein differ among various species (S1).
In order to elucidate the functional significance of
these mutations, site directed mutagenesis of PTPN6WT
was performed. Lentiviral vectors pLEX-PTPN6WT,
pLEX-PTPN6N225K and pLEX-PTPN6A550V were

with IFN-α, IL-2, IL-6 or IL-10 resulted in decreased
phosphorylation of STAT3 but not STAT5 as compared

Interestingly, neither STAT3 nor STAT5 phosphorylation

changed in cells expressing PTPN6 mutants in response to
cytokine treatments as compared to cells transduced with

indicate that PTPN6 mutations, N225K or A550V can
deregulate STAT3 phosphorylation in cancer cells.

immunoprecipitates. As shown in Figure 3A, we could
not detect STAT3 in PTPN6 immunoprecipitates from
cells expressing either PTPN6 mutants or WT constructs
(Figure 3A). These results suggest lack of direct physical
interaction between PTPN6 and STAT3. While our
results overruled a direct interaction between STAT3 and
PTPN6, PTPN6 may potentially regulate STAT3 activity
by interacting with upstream JAK kinases such as JAK1,
JAK2 and JAK3. In order to detect association between
PTPN6 and the JAK proteins, we co-immunoprecipitated
JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 from the cells overexpressing WT

PTPN6 acts as a negative regulator of intracellular
signaling by inhibiting the recruitment of transmembrane
receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.[34]
To investigate whether PTPN6 and STAT3 physically
interact, we pulled down PTPN6 from HEK293T cells
overexpressing PTPN6WT, PTPN6N225K and PTPN6A550V
and assessed the presence of STAT3 in PTPN6

Bcl-2, survivin, Mcl-1 and c-Myc are important
downstream targets of STAT3.[35] We sought to determine
whether PTPN6 mutations could affect expression of these
STAT3 targets. Overexpression of WT PTPN6 inhibited
the protein levels of Mcl-1 and survivin but no effect on
Bcl-2 and c-Myc (Figure 5B-5C). On the other hand Mcl-1
and survivin levels were not decreased in PTPN6 mutants
overexpressing cells (Figure 5B-5C). Additionally,
overexpression of WT PTPN6 slightly protected against
cell proliferation as compared to the vector alone,
however overexpression of PTPN6 mutants promoted
cell proliferation (Figure 5D). Taken together these results
indicate that via disrupting phosphatase activity of PTPN6,
genetic mutations in PTPN6 potentiate oncogenic effects
of STAT3.

or mutant PTPN6 and assessed the presence of PTPN6. In
WT PTPN6 expressing cells, PTPN6 binding was detected
only in JAK3 immunoprecipitates, but not in JAK1 or
JAK2 immunoprecipitates. Moreover, the PTPN6 mutants
tend to bind with high affinity with JAK3 as compared
to WT PTPN6, a low affinity binding of PTPN6 mutants
was also observed with JAK1 or JAK2 (Figure 3B).
Overall, these data demonstrate that the ability of PTPN6
to dephosphorylate STAT3 is mediated by an increased
physical interaction with JAK3 kinase. Enhanced binding
observed between JAK3 and PTPN6 mutants may
potentially arise from lack of PTPN6 enzymatic activity
required for changes in the JAK-STAT signaling complex
(Figure 3B).

Discussion
To further improve the clinical outcomes in DLBCL,
current research is aimed on increasing the understanding
of the pathophysiology of this disease by focusing on
the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
pathogenesis of lymphoma. STAT3 deregulation is
shown to be present in 35-40% of DLBCL cases.[16, 36]
The approval of the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib
in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms[37] has
increased investigations as to whether inhibiting JAK/
STAT signaling will be effective in DLBCL. Herein, we
demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in protein
tyrosine phosphatase PTPN6, a negative regulator of JAK/
STAT pathway, [3, 30, 38, 39] leads to deregulated STAT3
signaling and accumulation of proto-oncogenes that are
direct downstream targets of STAT3. Epigenetic silencing
of PTPN6, either due to DNA methylation or histone
modification, as a contributive factor for deregulated
JAK/STAT signaling has been previously described in
various hematologic malignancies.[27, 28, 40] However,
the role of PTPN6 mutations in DLBCL remains unclear.
In the present study, we found 2 heterozygous missense
mutations in the PTPN6 gene. N225K and A550V
mutations were identified in 2 separate patient tumors
from a set of 38 DLBCL tumors (2/38; 5.2%), indicating
that PTPN6 mutations in DLBCL tumors are uncommon.
Interestingly, both mutations demonstrated
decreased tyrosine phosphatase activity as compared
to WT PTPN6, suggesting that both mutations are
loss of function mutations. The presence of decreased
phosphatase activity in PTPN6 mutations raised the
question of whether those mutations play a role in
JAK/STAT3 deregulation. Consistent with previous
reports, PTPN6WT was able to dephosphorylate basal
level of tyrosine of STAT3, [40-42] while N225K and
A550V mutations were shown to decrease the ability
of PTPN6 to suppress constitutive pSTAT3 levels. The
same pattern was observed after IFN-α, IL-2, IL-6 and
IL-10 stimulation. A study recently demonstrated the

The JAK/STAT pathway is considered a promising
target in DLBCL and several other types of cancer, and
many JAK kinase inhibitors are being tested in clinic. To
determine whether PTPN6 modulates cellular sensitivity
to pharmacological inhibitors of JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3
kinases, we treated 293T cells expressing WT or mutant
PTPN6 with various concentrations of the Ruxolitinib
(JAK1/JAK2 selective inhibitor), SAR302503 (a JAK2
specific inhibitor) or WHI-P154 (JAK3 specific inhibitor).
Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors Ruxolitinib
and SAR302503 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3
in cells expressing WT PTPN6 or mutants (Figure 4A4B). Treatment with the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P154
completely suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation only
in cells expressing WT PTPN6 cells at all the various
concentrations tested. In contrast, a dose dependent effect
of WHI-P154 on STAT3 phosphorylation was observed
in cells expressing PTPN6 mutants, and complete
dephosphorylation was observed at 3-5 fold higher
concentrations of WHI-P154, suggesting that loss of
PTPN6 activity due to mutations may cause resistance to
the JAK3 inhibition (Figure 4C).

assays were carried out. As demonstrated in Figure 5A,
compared to WT PTPN6, which significantly decreased
transactivation activity of STAT3, PTPN6 mutants had
only moderate decline in STAT3 transactivation activity,
which is relatively more evident in cells transfected with
PTPN6A550V cells (Figure 5A).

important role of PTPN6 as a negative regulator of STAT3
phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation with
IL-6. The same study, also demonstrated the decreased
ability of PTPN6 to dephosphorylate STAT3 in motheaten mice (me/+ and me/me phenotypes).[42] Although
PTPN6 was also shown to inactivate the JAK/STAT
pathway by dephosphorylation of the JAK kinases, [43]
the physical association between STAT3 and PTPN6
has not been illustrated before. In view of the tyrosine
phosphatase property of PTPN6, a possible additional
mechanism through which PTPN6 dephosphorylates
STAT3 is direct inactivation using STAT proteins as
substrates. Our findings, however, suggest that binding
between PTPN6 and STAT3 does not exist and these data
come in contrast with a previous hypothesis by Paling et
al. [44] Han et al. [45] demonstrated that loss of PTPN6
enhances JAK3/STAT3 interaction in ALK + anaplastic
large-cell lymphoma. By performing immunoprecipitation
studies, we found that direct interaction of JAK3 with
PTPN6 was enhanced in PTPN6 mutants as compared to
WT PTPN6. Our finding is consistent with recent study
demonstrated that PTPN6 has increased affinity towards
phosphorylated JAK kinases.[46] Taken together with our
data, we propose that PTPN6 regulates STAT3 signaling
through deactivation of the upstream modulators such as
JAK3 kinase.
The proto-oncogenic role of constitutively active
STAT3 in tumor growth and invasion occurs due to
transcription of genes related to tumor cell survival.
[47, 48] Persistent activation of STAT3 in tumor cells
participates in the expression and regulation of genes
involved in controlling apoptosis such as Mcl-1, Bcl2, survivin and c-Myc.[35, 49] The inhibitory effect
of PTPN6WT on Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and survivin is already
known.[45] Consistently, our results imply that while
overexpression of PTPN6WT via inhibition of STAT3
suppresses levels of Mcl-1 and survivin, mutant PTPN6
results in accumulation of these proteins. The promising
results of Ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis and
the emerging relevance of the JAK-STAT pathway in
DLBCL pathogenesis, has led to an ongoing clinical trial
in patients with relapsed DLBCL and T-cell lymphoma
(Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT01431209). In the
studies reported here, we sought to address the question
whether PTPN6 mutations affect response to Ruxolitinib
and other JAK kinase inhibitors. Of importance, and
contrary to WT PTPN6, PTPN6 mutants were slightly
resistant to JAK3 inhibition. In summary, this study
provides evidence that N225K and A550V mutations
in PTPN6 are able to cause loss-of-function of PTPN6
leading to increased binding to JAK3 kinase and resulted
in STAT3 deregulation and accumulation of survivin and
Mcl-1.
