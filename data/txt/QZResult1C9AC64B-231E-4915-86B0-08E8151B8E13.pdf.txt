Abstract
Dysregulation of MYC expression is a hallmark of cancer, but
the development of agents that target MYC has remained challenging. The oncogenic MUC1-C transmembrane protein is, like
MYC, aberrantly expressed in diverse human cancers. The present
studies demonstrate that MUC1-C induces MYC expression in
KRAS mutant non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, an effect
that can be suppressed by targeting MUC1-C via shRNA silencing,
CRISPR editing, or pharmacologic inhibition with GO-203.
MUC1-C activated the WNT/b-catenin (CTNNB1) pathway and
promoted occupancy of MUC1-C/b-catenin/TCF4 complexes on
the MYC promoter. MUC1-C also promoted the recruitment of
the p300 histone acetylase (EP300) and, in turn, induced histone
H3 acetylation and activation of MYC gene transcription. We also

show that targeting MUC1-C decreased the expression of key MYC
target genes essential for the growth and survival of NSCLC cells,
such as TERT and CDK4. Based on these results, we found that the
combination of GO-203 and the BET bromodomain inhibitor
JQ1, which targets MYC transcription, synergistically suppressed
MYC expression and cell survival in vitro as well as tumor xenograft
growth. Furthermore, MUC1 expression signiﬁcantly correlated with that of MYC and its target genes in human KRAS
mutant NSCLC tumors. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest
a therapeutic approach for targeting MYC-dependent cancers
and provide the framework for the ongoing clinical studies
addressing the efﬁcacy of MUC1-C inhibition in solid tumors.

Introduction

mutant, designated OmoMyc, eradicates KRAS-driven non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in mice (6, 11). Induction of a dominantnegative MYC allele in a KRAS-dependent mouse model of lung
cancer has also demonstrated the effectiveness of inhibiting MYC
function (12). In addition, BET bromodomain inhibition with JQ1
is effective against transgenic mouse models of NSCLC expressing
mutant KRAS (13). These ﬁndings have provided support for the
notion that MYC is an attractive target for the treatment of KRAS
mutant NSCLC.
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane heterodimeric protein
that is aberrantly expressed in over 80% of NSCLCs (14). Moreover, aberrant expression of MUC1 in NSCLC is associated with
poor disease-free and overall survival (14–16). MUC1 consists of
an extracellular N-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) that contains
glycosylated tandem repeats, which are characteristic of the mucin
family (17). MUC1-N forms a complex with the transmembrane
MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C; ref. 17). MUC1-C includes
an intrinsically disordered 72 amino acid cytoplasmic domain
that is phosphorylated by diverse kinases and interacts with
various effectors that have been linked to transformation (18).
In this way, the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain activates the WNT/
b-catenin pathway by binding directly to b-catenin (19). In
turn, MUC1-C stabilizes b-catenin and promotes the induction
of certain WNT target genes, such as cyclin D1 (20, 21). The
MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain contains a CQC motif that is
necessary for MUC1-C homodimerization and function (22,
23). Notably, expression of MUC1-C with a CQC!AQA mutation inhibits anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity
of cancer cells, indicating that the AQA mutant functions as
a dominant-negative for transformation (22, 24). Accordingly,
cell-penetrating peptides, such as GO-203, have been developed

MYC functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor that
activates a cellular program of genes contributing to the control
of cell growth, metabolism, protein synthesis, and survival (1, 2).
Dysregulation of MYC expression occurs in diverse human cancers
(3) and is sufﬁcient to confer tumorigenesis in transgenic mouse
models (4). MYC is also of importance for tumor maintenance as
evidenced by tumor regressions in response to MYC downregulation (5) or treatment with an inhibitor of MYC heterodimerization
(6). Moreover, targeting MYC expression with the bromodomain
and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 is active
against models of multiple myeloma (7), leukemia (8), and NUT
midline carcinoma (9). Other studies have provided evidence for
the dependence of mutant KRAS tumors on MYC signaling (10). In
this context, inducible expression of the dominant-negative MYC

MUC1-C Activates MYC Signaling in KRAS Mutant NSCLC

to target the MUC1-C CQC motif and block MUC1-C–mediated
activation of growth and survival pathways in NSCLC cells (25).
In addition, targeting MUC1-C in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells with
GO-203 and other approaches, such as silencing, have shown that
MUC1-C drives the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
confers stemness (26).
The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C activates MYC
gene transcription in mutant KRAS NSCLC cells. Targeting MUC1C thus suppresses MYC expression and the induction of key MYC
target genes, such as hTERT and CDK4. We further show that (i)
treatment of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells with GO-203 is synergistic
with the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in targeting MYC
activation and survival, and (ii) the GO-203/JQ1 combination
is signiﬁcantly more active than GO-203 or JQ1 alone in inhibiting growth of tumor xenografts and downregulating MYC levels in
vivo. In support of these results, analysis of datasets from KRAS
mutant NSCLC tumors demonstrated a signiﬁcant correlation
between MUC1 and MYC expression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human A549/KRAS(G12S), H460/KRAS(Q61H), H358/KRAS
(G12C), H441/KRAS(G12V), H2009/KRAS(G12A), H1975/
EGFR(L858R/T790M), PC9GR/EGFR(delE746_A750), and
H838s(mutant p53) NSCLC cells (ATCC) were grown in
RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS (HI-FBS), 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. Cells were infected with lentiviral
vectors expressing a scrambled control shRNA (CshRNA; Sigma)
or a MUC1 shRNA (MUC1shRNA, Sigma; ref. 26). Cells stably
expressing MUC1-C or MUC1-C(CQC!AQA) were generated as
described (26). Cells were treated with the MUC1-C inhibitor
peptide GO-203 or a control peptide CP-2 (25).
MUC1 silencing by CRISPR editing
The knockdown of MUC1 expression by CRISPR/cas9 was
achieved as described (27). The sgRNAs targeting the ﬁrst exon
of the MUC1 gene were cloned into a lenti-CRISPR plasmid
(Genome Engineering Production Group, Harvard Medical
School). The viral vectors were produced in HEK293T cells as
previously described (28). Cells were transduced with the vectors
and cultured in the presence of puromycin. Single cell clones were
selected by limiting dilution.
Immunoblot analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared in NP-40 lysis buffer and
analyzed by immunoblotting with anti–MUC1-C (LabVision),
anti-MYC (Abcam), anti–b-actin (Sigma), anti-CDK4 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-cyclin D1 (NeoMarkers), anti–phosphoRb, and anti-Rb (BD Biosciences) as described (28). Immune
complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase secondary
antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen).
cDNAs were synthesized from 1 mg RNA using the High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). The diluted
cDNAs were ampliﬁed using the SYBR green qPCR assay Kit with
the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems).
Primers used for detection of MYC, MUC1, CDK4, hTERT, and
GAPDH mRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Promoter-reporter assays
Cells growing in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.5 mg of
TOPFlash (Addgene), pGL3 basic vector (Promega), or pGL3MYC-Luc promoter vector (29) and SV-40-Renilla-Luc in the
presence of Superfect (Qiagen). The pGL3-pMYC-Luc vector was
also mutated using the QuickChange II Kit (Agilent Technologies). At 48 hours after transfection, the cells were lysed in passive
lysis buffer. Lysates were analyzed with the Dual-Luciferase assay
kit (Promega).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Soluble chromatin was prepared from 2 to 3  106 cells as
described (30) and precipitated with anti-TCF4 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or a control nonimmune IgG. For re-chromatin
immunoprecipitation (re-ChIP) assays, TCF4 complexes from the
primary ChIP were released and re-immunoprecipitated with
anti–MUC1-C (NeoMarkers), anti–b-catenin (Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and antiacetyl histone H3 (Millipore) as described (21). The SYBR Green
qPCR Kit was used for the qPCR analyses with the ABI Prism 7000
Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for the
MYC promoter and control GAPDH region are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Relative fold enrichment was calculated as
described (21).
Colony formation assays
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 hours and then treated
with GO-203 each day and/or with JQ1 every 3 days. After 10 days,
the cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol.
Colonies >25 cells were counted in triplicate wells.
Determination of IC50 values and survival analysis
Cells were seeded on 96-well plates in 100 mL growth medium
at a density of 1,000 to 2,000 cells per well. After 24 hours, the cells
were exposed to GO-203 and/or JQ1 for an additional 72 hours.
Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo One Solution
(Promega). Triplicate wells for each treatment were analyzed, and
each experiment was performed three times. The IC50 was determined by nonlinear regression of the dose-response data using
Prism 5.0 for Mac OSX (GraphPad Software). Cells were exposed
to 1:1 ratios of the respective IC50 values for GO-203 and JQ1 at 1/
4  IC50, 1/2  IC50, 1  IC50, 2  IC50, and 4  IC50. Assessment
of synergy was performed using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). The
combination index (CI) was calculated to assess synergism (CI <
1) or antagonism (CI > 1).
NSCLC tumor xenograft treatment studies
Six-week-old female NCR nu/nu mice were injected with 3 
106 H460 cells subcutaneously in the ﬂank. When the tumors
reached approximately 150 mm3, the mice were pair-matched
into four groups of 5 mice each and were treated with (i) control
vehicle, (ii) 12 mg/kg GO-203 administered i.p. each day, (iii) 50
mg/kg JQ1 administered i.p. each day, or (iv) both GO-203 and
JQ1 administered i.p. each day. Tumor volumes were calculated
using the formula V ¼ L  W2/2, where L and W are the larger and
smaller diameters, respectively.
Analysis of NSCLC databases
Clinical datasets of lung adenocarcinoma patients with corresponding KRAS and EGFR mutation status were downloaded
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession numbers

from the PCR-based MYC target gene array. Gene expression
values were calculated relative to the median value of KRAS
wild-type tumors. Multiple probe set IDs for a given gene were
averaged for each patient sample after normalization to obtain a
representative expression value for each gene. Heatmaps were
created by hierarchical clustering via Ward's method to display
gene expression patterns. Statistical analysis and clustering were
performed using JMP 9.0 (SAS Institute).

Results
Targeting MUC1 downregulates MYC expression
To determine whether MUC1-C contributes to MYC regulation,
we ﬁrst studied the effects of targeting MUC1-C in KRAS mutant
A549 lung cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Partial suppression of MUC1-C
with a MUC1 shRNA was associated with downregulation of MYC

1540 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

levels (Fig. 1A, left). Similar results were obtained in KRAS mutant
H460 lung cancer cells (Fig. 1A, right). To extend these studies,
silencing MUC1-C with CRISPR genome editing also suppressed
MYC expression in A549 and H460 cells (Figs. 1B, left and right).
Moreover, silencing MUC1-C in KRAS mutant H441 (Supplementary Fig. S1A), H358 (Supplementary Fig. S1B), and H2009
(Supplementary Fig. S1C) cells was associated with suppression
of MYC. Intriguingly, however, targeting MUC1-C in EGFR
mutant H1975 and PC9 NSCLC cells, which also express both
MUC1-C and MYC (Supplementary Fig. S2A), had no apparent
effect on MYC levels (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C), indicating that MUC1-C selectively promotes MYC expression in KRAS
mutant lung cancer cells. The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain
contains a CQC motif that is necessary for MUC1-C homodimerization and function (Fig. 1C; refs. 22, 23). Accordingly, the cellpenetrating peptide, designated GO-203, was developed to block
the MUC1-C CQC motif in lung and other carcinoma cells

(Fig. 1C; refs. 18, 25). Notably, treatment of A549 and H460 cells
with GO-203, but not the control peptide CP-2, was associated
with downregulation of MYC (Fig. 1D and E). By contrast,
targeting MUC1-C with GO-203 in H838s NSCLC cells (KRAS
and EGFR wild-type; p53 mutant) had little if any effect on MYC
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2D, left and right). A549 cells
were also stably transduced to express MUC1-C or the MUC1-C
(AQA) mutant (Fig. 1F). Overexpression of MUC1-C was associated with a marked increase in MYC levels (Fig. 1F). In addition,
expression of the MUC1-C(AQA) mutant resulted in suppression
of MYC as compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1F). These
ﬁndings collectively supported the premise that MUC1-C activates MYC expression.
MUC1-C drives MYC transcription
To deﬁne in part the mechanism by which MUC1-C contributes
to MYC regulation, we assessed the effects of silencing MUC1-C
on MYC mRNA levels. Downregulation of MUC1-C in A549 cells
with shRNA was associated with suppression of MYC transcripts
as determined by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A, left). Similar results were
obtained with A549 cells, in which MUC1-C was silenced with
CRISPR editing (Fig. 2A, right). Moreover, silencing MUC1-C in
H460 cells with either approach resulted in downregulation of

www.aacrjournals.org

MYC mRNA levels (Fig. 2B, left and right). To determine whether
MUC1-C activates the MYC promoter, we transfected cells to
express a Del4 pMYC-Luc reporter that contains a TCF4 binding
element (TBE) upstream of the MYC transcription start site (Fig.
2C). Using this approach, we found that targeting MUC1-C in
A549 cells suppresses MYC promoter activation (Fig. 2D). Similar
results were obtained when H460 cells were transfected to express
pMYC-Luc (Fig. 2E). To conﬁrm these results, we overexpressed
MUC1-C in H460/CRISPR cells in a "rescue" experiment, which
showed induction of pMYC-Luc activity and MYC expression (Fig.
2F, left and right). Similar results were obtained when A549/
CRISPR cells were rescued with MUC1-C (Supplementary Fig. S3,
left and right), indicating that MUC1-C induces MYC expression
at least in part at the transcriptional level.
MUC1-C activates the MYC promoter through the TBE
MUC1-C has been linked to activation of the WNT/b-catenin
pathway (18). Moreover, MYC is a downstream effector of WNT/
b-catenin signaling (1). Accordingly, we ﬁrst asked if targeting
MUC1-C in A549 cells affects activation of the TOPFlash reporter,
which is driven by b-catenin/TCF4 complexes (31). Here, we
found that silencing MUC1-C signiﬁcantly decreases TOPFlash
activity (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained in H460 cells

occupies the MYC promoter in complexes with MUC1-C and
b-catenin (Fig. 4A). Silencing MUC1-C in A549 cells had little if
any effect on TCF4 occupancy, but in re-ChIP assays was associated with signiﬁcant decreases in both MUC1-C and b-catenin
(Fig. 4B). In the absence of b-catenin, TCF4 recruits corepressors,
such as HDAC1 (32, 33). By contrast, the interaction between
TCF4 and b-catenin displaces corepressors and promotes recruitment of the p300 histone acetyltransferase and coactivator (34,
35). In concert with those ﬁndings, silencing MUC1-C was associated with a signiﬁcant decrease in p300 occupancy on the MYC
promoter in A549 (Fig. 4C) and H460 (Fig. 4D) cells. Moreover,
silencing MUC1-C was associated with a marked decrease in
histone H3 acetylation of the MYC promoter (Fig. 4E and F).

silenced for MUC1-C (Fig. 3B), indicating that MUC1-C activates
the WNT/b-catenin pathway in these NSCLC cells. To determine
whether MUC1-C drives the MYC promoter through WNT/b-catenin signaling, we assessed the effects of mutating the TBE (Fig.
3C). Using this approach, we found that the TBE mutation
markedly decreases pMYC-Luc activity in A549 (Fig. 3D) and
H460 (Fig. 3E) cells, indicating that MUC1-C induces MYC gene
expression through activation of the WNT/b-catenin/TCF4
pathway.
MUC1-C occupies the MYC promoter
Previous work demonstrated that MUC1-C binds directly to
b-catenin (19, 20) and forms a complex with b-catenin/TCF4 on
the cyclin D promoter (21). In the present studies, ChIP analysis of
the MYC promoter in A549 cells conﬁrmed TCF4 occupancy (Fig.
4A). Moreover, the results of re-ChIP assays showed that TCF4

Silencing MUC1-C downregulates MYC target genes
To assess the effects of silencing MUC1-C on MYC-induced
transcription, we analyzed MYC target gene expression in cells
using a commercially available PCR array. Other MYC family
members (MYCN, MYCL) and MAX are also represented in this
array. Interestingly and in addition to MYC, marked suppression
of MYCN and MYCL mRNAs was observed in the response of
A549 cells to MUC1-C silencing (Fig. 5A). Moreover, we found
downregulation of MAX expression (Fig. 5A). Among others,
suppression of the MYC target genes, hTERT (36) and CDK4
(37), was also detected in the A549/MUC1shRNA cells (Fig. 5A).
Similar results were obtained when analyzing the effects of
MUC1-C silencing in H460 cells (Fig. 5B). To conﬁrm these
ﬁndings, at least in part, we found that silencing MUC1-C is
associated with suppression of hTERT (Fig. 5C, left and right) and
CDK4 (Fig. 5D, left and right) mRNA levels. And, in concert with
these results, we found that silencing MUC1-C results in downregulation of CDK4 protein and phosphorylation of its downstream target Rb (Fig. 5E, left and right).
Targeting MUC1-C is synergistic with JQ1 in the treatment of
KRAS mutant NSCLC cells
The JQ1 BET bromodomain inhibitor was the ﬁrst agent that
was found to suppress MYC transcription (7). Based on these and
the present ﬁndings, we investigated whether combining GO-203
with JQ1 is effective against KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. Accordingly, we ﬁrst deﬁned the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations
of these agents when used alone in the treatment of A549 cells and
then performed an isobologram analysis. The results obtained
demonstrated a synergistic interaction (Fig. 6A). Determination
of the CI values at ED50, ED75, and ED90 demonstrated that the
GO-203/JQ1 combination is synergistic (Supplementary Table
S3A). Similar results were obtained when H460 cells were treated
with GO-203 and JQ1 (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table S3B);
however, there was no evidence for synergy when H1975 (Supplementary Table S3C) or PC9GR (Supplementary Table S3D)
cells were exposed to these agents. Treatment of A549 (Fig. 6C)
and H460 (Fig. 6D) cells with synergistic combinations was also
more effective in suppressing clonogenic survival than that
obtained with GO-203 or JQ1 alone. We similarly found that
treatment of A549 cells with a synergistic combination of GO203/JQ1 results in more pronounced suppression of MYC mRNA
(Fig. 6E, left) and protein (Fig. 6E, right) levels than that obtained
with GO-203 or JQ1 alone. Moreover, in experiments with H460
cells, combining GO-203 and JQ1 was more effective in suppressing MYC expression (Fig. 6F, left and right) than either agent
alone. To extend this analysis, treatment of established H460

tumor xenografts further showed that the GO-203/JQ1 combination is signiﬁcantly more active than GO-203 or JQ1 alone in
inhibiting tumor growth and downregulating MYC levels (Fig.
6G, left and right).
MYC-dependent gene expression in human KRAS mutant lung
cancers
Our experimental results obtained from cell-based and mouse
models lend support to a functional association of MUC1-C with
MYC in KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas. However, there is
no evidence that MUC1-C is linked to expression of MYC-dependent target genes in patients with lung cancer. We therefore
investigated the expression of MYC target genes in clinical datasets
of KRAS wild-type and mutant lung adenocarcinomas. Microarray
analysis of 82 MYC-dependent genes obtained from the PCRbased MYC array identiﬁed approximately 40% of patients with
overexpression of MYC target genes (Fig. 7A). We examined
overexpression of MYC-dependent genes as a function of KRAS
mutation status. The results demonstrate a signiﬁcantly higher
incidence of KRAS mutations in tumors with elevated levels of
MYC target gene expression (64% vs. 18%, P ¼ 0.0008, two-tailed
Fisher exact test, Fig. 7A). In addition, tumors bearing KRAS
mutations signiﬁcantly overexpressed the MYC gene (P ¼
0.0060, two-tailed t test) as compared with KRAS wild-type
tumors (Fig. 7B). In contrast, EGFR mutant tumors demonstrated
reduced levels of MYC expression as compared with EGFR wildtype tumors (Fig. 7C). In an independent clinical dataset of lung
adenocarcinomas, we conﬁrmed an association between MYCdependent target gene expression and KRAS mutations (Fig. 7D).
Importantly, we found a strong correlation between MUC1 and
MYC gene expression values in KRAS mutant tumors (Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient, r ¼ 0.75, P ¼ 0.0052), but not in KRAS
wild-type tumors (r ¼ 0.25, P ¼ 0.21). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas
overexpress MYC and MYC-dependent genes and support a role
for MUC1 in driving MYC expression in KRAS mutant tumors.

Discussion
NSCLCs that harbor an oncogenic KRAS mutation are often
resistant to conventional and targeted agents (38). In addition,
inhibitors of activated KRAS have been clinically ineffective to
date, supporting the need for identifying agents that block downstream KRAS signaling pathways. Previous work showed that
targeting MUC1-C in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells is associated
with decreases in self-renewal and tumorigenicity; however, the
mechanism(s) responsible for these responses was unclear (26).
The present studies provide new insights into the function of
MUC1-C in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells by demonstrating that
targeting MUC1-C is associated with downregulation of MYC
expression. MYC is of functional importance in orchestrating

transcriptional pathways that regulate cell-cycle progression,
metabolism, survival, and stemness (1, 39, 40). Therefore, the
effects of targeting MUC1-C on self-renewal of KRAS mutant
NSCLC cells can be attributable, at least in part, to suppression
of MYC signaling. Notably, we have used multiple approaches for
targeting MUC1-C that include (i) silencing with MUC1 shRNA
and with CRISPR editing, and (ii) treatment with the GO-203
inhibitor. Using these different experimental conditions, diverse
KRAS mutant NSCLC cells responded with MYC downregulation,
providing convincing support for a MUC1-C!MYC pathway. By
contrast and interestingly, targeting MUC1-C in NSCLC cells
harboring EGFR mutations had little if any effect on MYC expression, indicating that the link between MUC1-C and MYC in
NSCLC may be limited to the KRAS mutant setting.
The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain is largely an intrinsically
disordered protein (41), which is often found in effectors at

regulatory nodes that integrate posttranslational signaling
mechanisms (42). In this regard, the MUC1-C cytoplasmic
domain interacts with multiple kinases and transcription factors
that have been linked to growth, survival, and transformation
(18). In the present studies, we found that MUC1-C drives MYC
gene transcription by activation of the WNT/b-catenin pathway.
The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain contains a motif with homology to sequences found in E-cadherin and APC that function as
b-catenin binding sites (19, 43). The MUC1-C cytoplasmic
domain thereby binds directly to b-catenin Armadillo repeats
and, in turn, blocks GSK3b-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of b-catenin (20). MUC1-C also interacts with the TCF4
transcription factor and promotes the formation of b-catenin/
TCF4 complexes on WNT target genes (21). In concert with this
model, we found that MUC1-C occupies the MYC promoter with
TCF4 in NSCLC cells. In addition, MUC1-C increased occupancy

of b-catenin on the MYC promoter and thereby contributed to the
recruitment of the p300 histone acetylase coactivator with induction of MYC gene transcription. These ﬁndings thus support a
model in which MUC1-C directly activates the MYC promoter in a
complex with b-catenin/TCF4. MUC1 has been linked to activation of the WNT/b-catenin pathway in certain cancer types (18),
however, to our knowledge, not previously in NSCLC cells. In
addition, certain studies in breast cancer cells have shown that
targeting MUC1 is associated with upregulation of MYC expression (44). Thus, the demonstration that MUC1-C drives MYC by a
b-catenin–mediated mechanism in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells is
of particular interest given their dependence on MYC for survival.
The MYC target gene network is estimated to comprise about
15% of all human genes that are subject to both MYC-induced
activation and repression (45). To assess the effects of targeting
MUC1-C on MYC target genes, we used a commercially available
array that also included MYCN, MYCL, and MAX. Surprisingly, we
found that targeting MUC1-C is associated with downregulation

1546 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

of these genes, indicating that MUC1-C regulates all of the MYC
family members, as well as MAX, the requisite binding partner for
MYC-mediated transactivation (1). Using the same array, we
found that targeting MUC1-C results in the upregulation and
suppression of a number of different MYC target genes. For the
present studies, we conﬁrmed that targeting MUC1-C downregulates hTERT expression, based on the importance of this catalytic
subunit of telomerase in maintaining telomere length and extending the life span of cells (46). Moreover, and concert with activated
RAS and MYC, hTERT is an essential effector in models of
transforming primary human cells (47). We also conﬁrmed that
targeting MUC1-C results in suppression of CDK4, a MYC target
gene that is essential for cell-cycle progression (39). In addition,
CDK4 is of importance for the growth and survival of NSCLC cells
expressing mutant KRAS (48). And, like hTERT, ectopic expression
of CDK4 has been associated with immortalization of primary
human cells (47). These ﬁndings and the signiﬁcant correlation
between MUC1 and MYC expression identiﬁed in datasets from

MUC1-C Activates MYC Signaling in KRAS Mutant NSCLC

KRAS mutant NSCLC tumors thus support the notion that MUC1C drives MYC and thereby MYC target genes that are of importance
for transformation.
Dysregulation of MYC expression is observed at high frequency
in NSCLC and diverse other cancer types, supporting MYC as a
highly attractive target (49). Blocking MYC/MAX heterodimerization with Omomyc in KRAS-driven lung cancer in mice has further
validated MYC as a target with an acceptable therapeutic index
(11). Moreover, treatment of a transgenic mouse KRAS mutant
NSCLC model with JQ1 has shown that targeting MYC by BET
bromodomain inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy
(13). The present studies demonstrate that targeting MUC1-C
with GO-203 is another potential approach for suppressing MYC
expression. Accordingly and based on the ﬁndings that GO-203
and JQ1 inhibit MYC transcription by distinct mechanisms, we
investigated the potential for combining these agents. Indeed, our
studies show that combining GO-203 and JQ1 is synergistic in
inhibiting growth and that GO-203 potentiates the inhibitory
effects of JQ1 on MYC expression. The GO-203/JQ1 combination
was also more effective in inhibiting growth of H460 tumor
xenografts than either agent alone. The BET bromodomain inhibitors GSK525762 and TEN-010 are being evaluated in phase I
clinical trials. Moreover, a phase I trial of GO-203 has been
completed in patients with refractory solid tumors and has been
formulated in nanoparticles for assessing the effectiveness of this
agent in treating NSCLC (50). Based on the present results,
subsequent studies that assess the activity of GO-203 with BET
bromodomain inhibitors could be potentially informative in the

setting of KRAS mutant NSCLC and possibly other MYC-dependent cancers.
