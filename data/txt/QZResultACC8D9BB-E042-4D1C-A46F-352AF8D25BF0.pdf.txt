ABSTRACT
As the development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has become an issue of concern, identification of
the mechanisms responsible has become an urgent priority. However, for research
purposes, it is not easy to obtain tumor samples from patients with EGFR mutationpositive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has relapsed after treatment with
EGFR-TKIs. Here, using digital PCR assay as an alternative and noninvasive method,
we examined plasma and tumor samples from patients with relapsed NSCLC to
establish the inter-relationships existing among T790M mutation, activating EGFR
mutations, HER2 amplification, and MET amplification. Paired samples of tumor and
blood were obtained from a total of 18 patients with NSCLC after they had developed
resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment, and the mechanisms of resistance were analyzed
by digital PCR. Digital PCR analysis of T790M mutation in plasma had a sensitivity of
81.8% and specificity of 85.7%, the overall concordance between plasma and tissue
samples being 83.3%. MET gene copy number gain in tumor DNA was observed by
digital PCR in three patients, of whom one exhibited positivity for MET amplification
by FISH, whereas no patient demonstrated MET and HER2 copy number gain in plasma
DNA. Digital PCR analysis of plasma is feasible and accurate for detection of T790M
mutation in NSCLC that becomes resistant to treatment with EGFR-TKIs.

mutation-positive NSCLC typically show good responses
to EGFR-TKIs, resistance eventually develops after 9 to
14 months. Several mechanisms of acquired resistance to
EGFR TKIs have been identified, including a second-site
point mutation that substitutes methionine for threonine
at position 790 (T790M) in the EGFR, amplification
of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) protooncogene and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2), and small-cell lung cancer transformation
[8–10]. The most common event responsible for resistance
is acquisition of the T790M mutation, which occurs in over

INTRODUCTION
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading
cause of cancer death worldwide [1]. Recent therapeutic
strategies for NSCLC have focused on the development
of molecular targeted therapies. Somatic mutations in the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been
identified as a major determinant of the clinical response
to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFRTKIs) such as gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib in individuals
with NSCLC [2–7]. Although patients with EGFR

50% of patients who initially respond to EGFR-TKIs [8].
Current clinical approaches for overcoming resistance
to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC include the use of mutantselective inhibitors of EGFR, a combination of cetuximab
and afatinib, and a combination of EGFR-TKI with a drug
inhibiting a resistance pathway, for example erlotinib used
together with a MET inhibitor [10–14].
Although tumor samples are required for studying
the mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs, it is difficult
to obtain such samples from patients with NSCLC who
have acquired such resistance. The level of tumor cell-free
DNA (cfDNA) in plasma specimens is reportedly higher in
patients with lung cancer than in those without cancer [15].
Here, we evaluated the application of digital PCR analysis
to plasma samples as an alternative and non-invasive
method for investigating the mechanisms of resistance
to EGFR-TKIs, including T790M resistance mutation
and amplification of MET and HER2, in comparison with
results obtained using tumor samples.

Ten T790M mutations were detected from all
18 plasma specimens, whereas 11 T790M mutations were
found in the paired tumor samples (Table 2). Notably,
one patient with plasma cfDNA T790M mutation had no
T790M mutation in the corresponding tumor DNA sample,
and two patients with T790M mutations in tumor DNA
specimens had no T790M mutation in the corresponding
plasma. The sensitivity and specificity of digital PCR
analysis for T790M mutation in plasma was 81.8% and
85.7%, respectively, and the overall concordance between
plasma and tumor samples was 83.3% (15/18). The
correlation between T790M mutations detected in the
plasma and tumor samples is summarized in Table 3.

Detection of MET and HER2 copy number
Analysis of tumor samples confirmed a gain of
the MET copy number in three patients. However, FISH
analysis demonstrated MET amplification in only one
patient (Case 9), and no patients showed an increase of
the MET copy number in plasma. HER2 copy number gain
in the tumor and cfDNA were analyzed by digital PCR.
However, no copy number gain was detected in any of the
18 cases (data not shown).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics and efficacy of
EGFR-TKI treatment
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Among
the 18 patients, 16 were female and 2 were male. Seven
patients had E746-A750 deletion in exon 19, 10 had
L858R point mutation in exon 21, and one had a minor
mutation involving S752-I759 deletion in exon 19. One
patient received elrotinib and the others received gefitinib
as initial EGFR-TKI treatment. The EGFR-TKI treatment
was provided as the first-line chemotherapy in 13 patients,
the second line in three, the third line in one, and the fourth
line in one. The overall rate of response to initial EGFRTKI treatment was 72.2%, with a median progression-free
survival 11.7 months. Tumor specimens after acquisition
of resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment were derived from
the primary lung lesion in 7 patients, pleural effusion
in 8, lymph node metastasis in 2, and pericardial effusion
in one.

DISCUSSION
In this study using digital PCR assay as an
alternative and non-invasive method for examining
plasma and tumor samples, we investigated correlations
among T790M mutation, activating EGFR mutations,
HER2 amplification, and MET amplification in patients
with NSCLC relapse after treatment with EGFR-TKIs.
Although previous studies have examined various
techniques for non-invasive detection of EGFR mutations
in NSCLC patients, such as amplification refractory
mutation systems, denaturing high-performance liquid
chromatography, multi-threaded electronic polymerase
chain reaction, and direct sequencing, the results have
been inconclusive, with sensitivities ranging from 43.1%
to 81.2% [16–23]. Yung et al. demonstrated that digital
PCR analysis had a high sensitivity of 91.7% for detection
of EGFR mutation in plasma samples [24], suggesting
that it would be a promising method for T790M analysis
of plasma cfDNA. Digital PCR is both a qualitative and
quantitative method, being capable of detecting genetic
alterations with a high specificity of up to 0.001% [25].
It has been reported that digital PCR analysis has high
sensitivity and a high detection ratio in comparison
with an allele-specific PCR technique such as scorpionARMS [26]. Given the high rates of false negativity for
EGFR mutation in plasma cfDNA [27], we investigated the

Consistency of primary activating EGFR
mutation between tumor and plasma
The results relating to the consistency of primary
active EGFR mutation status with tumor and plasma
cfDNA are shown in Table 2 and summarized in Table 3.
One patient (Case 1) who had a minor mutation involving
S752-I759 deletion in exon 19 was not evaluable. Of the
remaining 17 patients, 15 had detectable activating EGFR
mutation in the tumor, whereas 10 patients exhibited this
in the plasma cfDNA. All mutation types in these patients
were consistent with the primary EGFR mutation status
detected before treatment.

utility of digital PCR analysis as a highly sensitive assay
for clarifying the mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
Although other researchers have investigated the detection
of T790M mutant alleles in plasma cfDNA, they mostly
focused on factors predictive of EGFR-TKI treatment
outcome, such as monitoring of T790M mutation [28–31].
In this study, we found that digital PCR analysis of T790M
mutation in plasma had a high sensitivity of 81.8% and
a specificity of 85.7%, and that the overall concordance
between plasma and tissue samples was 83.3%. Using a
highly accurate method of digital PCR analysis, our study
demonstrated relatively high concordance with previous
studies that had investigated EGFR mutation status in
pre-treatment samples [16–23]. These results suggest that
digital PCR may be a feasible and clinically applicable
method for detection of T790M mutation in plasma
cfDNA. As far as we are aware, no previous study has

demonstrated a significant correlation of T790M mutation
between tumor samples and plasma cfDNA in individuals
with EGFR-mutant NSCLC that has acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs. Recently, third-generation EGFR-TKIs have
yielded promising results in patients with EGFR-mutation
positive NSCLC resistant to existing EGFR-TKIs [11,
12]. These new drugs were designed to inhibit  both the
activating EGFR mutation in patients with NSCLC as
well as the T790M resistance mutation, and showed a
high positive response rate to T790M mutation-positive
NSCLC of approximately 60% in phase I clinical trials
[32]. Although it is necessary to accurately identify
T790M mutation-positive patients for proper use of these
drugs, there are untestable patients such as those in whom
tumor lesions cannot be acquired safely, or those who do
not consent to re-biopsy. Given the high sensitivity and
specificity of T790M detection in plasma samples, digital

PCR analysis for T790M may be a promising approach for
EGFR mutant NSCLC that has relapsed after EGFR-TKI
treatment.
We also analyzed the plasma cfDNA of primary
activating EGFR mutation, which had been detected
previously in tumors before EGFR-TKI treatment, in
matched samples obtained after acquisition of resistance
to EGFR-TKI. Our results revealed that primary activating
EGFR mutation in plasma had a sensitivity of 66.7%,
which was relatively low in comparison to those in

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

previous studies that had examined EGFR mutations in
pre-treatment plasma [24], and those for the T790M
mutation in the present study. One possible explanation for
these discrepancies may be tumor mutational heterogeneity.
Several previous studies of NSCLC have demonstrated a
discrepancy of EGFR mutation status between the primary
tumor and the corresponding metastatic lesions [33–35],
and it has been suggested that the EGFR mutation status in
the latter may be more associated with favorable efficacy
of EGFR-TKI treatment than that in the former  [35].

T790M mutation
Plasma

One patient who had a minor mutation involving S752-I759 deletion in exon 19 was not evaluated for primary EGFR
mutation.
Discordance of EGFR mutation status has also been
reported even among different parts of a primary lung
tumor in any given individual [36, 37]. Additionally,
Graziano P et al. have reported the co-presence of lesions
positive for T790M mutation with lesions that are negative
in the same patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC after
development of resistance to EGFR-TKIs [38]. Although
T790M mutation was previously thought to be acquired
secondarily upon exposure to EGFR-TKI, recent studies
have shown that subclones harboring T790M pre-exist
in NSCLC patients even before EGFR-TKI treatment
[39, 40]. It has been hypothesized that EGFR-TKI
treatment may cause selection of cells harboring T790M
mutation, even though they may represent only a small
subclone of cancer cells upon initiation of treatment,
consequently leading to EGFR-TKI resistance as a
result of selective increase of such T790M clones [40].
T790M mutations exists as dominant clones in about
50% of patients with acquired resistance, and subclonal
populations of EGFR mutant tumor cells with or without
the T790M mutation can coexist in EGFR mutant NSCLC
that has acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. A tumor
sample obtained using only a single biopsy may not
necessarily reflect the dominant properties of the tumor,
and the primary activating EGFR mutation appears
to represent the non-dominant tumor clone in patients
with EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC. Indeed, primary
activating EGFR mutations in plasma were not detected
in third part of cases, even though they were detected in
tumor re-biopsy samples. This mutational heterogeneity
of tumors might account for the inconsistency between
analysis of the primary active mutation and T790M
mutation in identical paired samples, suggesting that
analysis of blood samples mirrors the dominant properties
of the tumor. Our results indicating that plasma samples
can be used to detect T790M mutation may provide some
patients with an opportunity to receive third-generation
EGFR-TKIs.

The MET and HER2 genes have been reported one
of the mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs
[9, 10]. Although some studies have investigated HER2
amplification in plasma cfDNA from patients with breast
cancer [41–43], no previous study has focused on MET
and HER2 in plasma of NSCLC patients. Therefore, in
the present study, we attempted to detect MET and HER2
amplifications in both tumor and plasma samples. Our
analysis of tumor samples using digital PCR confirmed
MET copy number gain in three patients. However,
FISH analysis demonstrated only one patient with
MET amplification, and none of the patients had a gain
in MET copy number on the basis of plasma samples.
Both MET gene copy number amplification and T790M
mutation were detected in case 16. Both genes of these
genes are considered to be exclusively involved in the
mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs, and these
results suggest intratumonal heterogeneity such as the
co-presence of clones with MET copy number gain and
T790M mutation. The discrepancy between MET copy
number gain and T790M mutation in the same case was
considered attributable to differences in the detection
sensitivity of the assays. Whereas T790M mutation is
defined on the basis of detection of positivity for the
mutant allele, MET copy number gain is defined by the
degree of copy number gain relative to the reference gene.
Therefore, admixing of normal cells would influence the
detection of MET copy number gain, unlike detection of
T790M mutation. Although our results did not allow us
to conclude whether digital PCR is helpful for detection
of MET and HER2 amplification in plasma samples, we
believe that a further large-scale study might clarify this
issue.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that digital
PCR analysis of T790M mutation in plasma samples
had high sensitivity and specificity in NSCLC patients
with resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Although our study was
retrospective in nature and had a relatively small sample

size, our results suggest that digital PCR to detect T790M
mutation in plasma samples could be an alternative and
non-invasive method for patients with EGFR-positive
NSCLC resistance to first- or second-generation EGFRTKIs, especially patients from whom tumor lesions can
be collected safely. In the future, plasma cfDNA may
become a standard detection modality for analysis of
EGFR mutations including T790M mutation.

30 s and 58°C for 90 s, followed by enzyme deactivation
at 98°C for 10 min. After thermal cycling, the plates were
transferred to a Droplet reader. The digital PCR data were
analyzed using the QuantaSoft analytical software package
(Bio-Rad). We have used control plasmids encoding wildtype EGFR, E746-A750 deletion, L858R, and a T790M
mutant as a control. The assay has been validated to detect
mutant variants at a level of 0.032%.
The cutoff values for DNA derived from the FFPE
specimens were determined using data for mutationnegative FFPE samples. The average and standard
deviation (SD) for EGFR E746-A750 deletion, L858R,
and T790M mutant copy number in 21 FFPE samples
were calculated. The average copy number for negative
samples plus 3SD was used as the cut-off value for each
mutation site; the higher value of either, the average plus
3SD or three copies was used as the cut-off value. The cutoff values were set at 6.0 copies for EGFR E746-A750,
4.0 copies for EGFR L858R, and 22.0 copies for EGFR
T790M. The cut-off values for DNA derived from
plasma or frozen samples were determined using data for
10 normal DNA samples. The cut-off values were set at
3.0 copies for EGFR E746-A750, L858R, and T790M.
MET and HER2 gene copy numbers were normalized
against RPP30 and EFTUD2, respectively. Normal
genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the
normal control (two copies). The cut-off values were set at
5.0 copies for MET and HER2 copy number gain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively screened 152 consecutive EGFR
mutation-positive NSCLC patients who had received
EGFR-TKI treatment at Kurume University Hospital
between 2007 and 2014. Among these patients, both tumor
specimens and blood samples were obtained from 18 with
appropriate tumor DNA after acquisition of resistance to
EGFR-TKI treatment.
The present study was conducted in accordance with
the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kurume
University Hospital.

Sample collection and processing
We used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections
or fresh frozen samples of tumors after acquisition of
resistance to treatment with EGFR-TKIs. For plasma
samples, 7 to 10 mL of peripheral blood was collected in
heparin-coated tubes from patients after they had acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. Plasma was removed
by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15 min within two hours
of collection and stored at −80°C until DNA extraction.
Plasma DNA was purified using a QIAamp Circulating
Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA
was stored at 4°C until analysis.

Digital PCR analysis
Mutant allele frequency was measured using the
QX100 Droplet Digital PCR System in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). The primers and probes for detecting EGFR
E746-A750 deletion, L858R, and T790M were purchased
from Bio-Rad. The PCR reaction was performed using
the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 min,
40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s and 55°C for 60 s, followed by
enzyme deactivation at 98°C for 10 min. For MET copy
number assay, the primer sequences were: MET forward,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization for MET
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was
performed to determine the MET copy number in FFPE
tumor specimens using a c-Met/CEN7p Dual Color
FISH Probe (GSP Laboratory, Kawasaki, Japan), where
CEN7p is the centromeric region of chromosome 7p.
After screening of all sections, images of tumor cells
were captured and recorded, and the signals for at
least 50  random nuclei were counted for an area in
which individual cells were recognized in each of at
least 10  representative images. Nuclei with a disrupted
boundary were excluded from the analysis. Gene
