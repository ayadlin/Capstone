Abstract
Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates protection against a
wide variety of toxic insults to cells, including cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Many lung cancer cells
harbor a mutation in either Nrf2 or its inhibitor Keap1 resulting in permanent activation of Nrf2 and
chemoresistance. In this study, we sought to examine whether this attribute could be exploited in cancer
suicide gene therapy by using a lentiviral (LV) vector expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK/
GCV) under the regulation of antioxidant response element (ARE), a cis-acting enhancer sequence that binds
Nrf2. In human lung adenocarcinoma cells in which Nrf2 is constitutively overexpressed, ARE activity was found
to be high under basal conditions. In this setting, ARE-HSV-TK was more effective than a vector in which HSV-TK
expression was driven by a constitutively active promoter. In a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer, suicide gene
therapy with LV-ARE-TK/GCV was effective compared with LV-PGK-TK/GCV in reducing tumor size. We
conclude that ARE-regulated HSV-TK/GCV therapy offers a promising approach for suicide cancer gene therapy
in cells with high constitutive ARE activity, permitting a greater degree of therapeutic targeting to those cells.

Introduction
Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production and
disposal of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays an important
role in carcinogenesis due to mutations in DNA, proteins, and
lipids caused by ROS (1). Importantly, many carcinogens act as
reactive electrophilic intermediates. On the other hand, the
effect of various anticancer drugs is based on ROS-mediated
apoptosis (2). Many cancers have developed resistance against
anticancer drugs, and in drug-resistant cancer cells the expression of many self-defence genes, such as antioxidant and phase
II detoxifying enzymes as well as drug efﬂux proteins is
increased (3–6).
The Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)–nuclear
factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), NFE2L2 pathway is
the major sensor of endogenous and environmental oxidant

and electrophile stress. Nrf2 is a member of the Cap'n'Collar
basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors, and
it recognizes the antioxidant response element (ARE) sequence
in the regulatory regions of target genes. In basal conditions,
Nrf2 is located in the cytoplasm and is repressed by the Keap1
dimer, which facilitates proteasomal degradation of Nrf2
through the Cullin3-Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase complex. On exposure to inducing agents, the interaction of Keap1 with Nrf2 is
interrupted so that Keap1 no longer is able to direct Nrf2 to
proteasomal degradation, and therefore Nrf2 stabilizes and
translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to ARE as
a heterodimer with small Maf proteins, and drives the expression of large number of ARE-regulated genes (7, 8). These genes
encode, for example, antioxidant and phase II detoxiﬁcation
enzymes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1),
glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1;
ref. 9). Nrf2 has also been shown to regulate the expression
of some efﬂux proteins, such as multidrug resistance proteins
(10, 11).
Nrf2 has long been recognized as the key mediator of cancer
chemoprevention (12, 13). Several chemopreventive agents,
such as dithiolethiones and isothiocyanates, have been shown
to exert their actions via Nrf2 activation, and some of these
agents, such as oltipratz and sulforaphane, have entered
clinical trials. In addition, Nrf2-deﬁcient mice are more susceptible to chemical-induced carcinogenesis (7, 14). However,
it has been recently discovered that Nrf2 not only protects
against cancer development but can also protect cancer cells
against chemotherapeutic agents thereby providing advantage
for cancer growth (15). Of note, it has been reported that Nrf2 is

overexpressed in several lung cancer cell lines and patient
samples, and this is mainly due to mutations in NFE2L2 or
KEAP1 genes. This has led to a notion that enhanced ARE
activity is in part responsible for the development of chemoresistance and that inhibition of the Nrf2 signaling pathway
could be beneﬁcial in certain cancers (16–19).
Suicide gene therapy is widely used in cancer gene therapy.
One of the most common suicide gene therapy systems is based
on thymidine kinase (TK) gene of the herpes simplex virus
(HSV). When thymidine kinase is transferred into cancer
cells and cells are treated with a prodrug ganciclovir (GCV),
ganciclovir is metabolized to ganciclovir-monophosphate.
Monophosphorylated ganciclovir is further phosphorylated by
cellular kinases into a triphosphate form, which is toxic to cells,
leading to death of not only tumor cells containing transferred
thymidine kinase gene but also the neighboring cells due to the
bystander effect (20). To enhance the tumor selectivity of the
system, several natural or synthetic enhancer-promoters have
been used to drive thymidine kinase expression. For example,
systems inducible by hypoxia, radiation, and oxidative stress
have been developed and successfully applied to tumor xenograft models (21–23).
The notion that ARE activity is constitutively high in certain
cancer cell types, prompted us to study whether this attribute
could be exploited in HSV-TK/GCV gene therapy by using the
ARE element to drive the transgene expression. Here, we show
that ARE-regulated HSV-TK/GCV therapy is effective both in
vitro and in vivo in A549 lung cancer cells, which have high
constitutive ARE activity due to mutations in Keap1 protein.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
All the cell lines used were purchased from The American
Type Culture Collection between years 2001 and 2010 and were
systematically validated for the expression of speciﬁc marker
genes, such as NFE2L2 and KEAP1. Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) FBS (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma).
Human bronchiolar pulmonary adenocarcinoma NCI-H441
cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% sodium-pyruvate (Sigma), 1% HEPES
(Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Bronchiolar Beas2B
cells were maintained in Bronchial Epithelial Cell Growth
Medium (Lonza) and were cultured in precoated [0.01 mg/mL
ﬁbronectin (Sigma), 0.03 mg/mL bovine collagen type I (Cultrex), and 0.01 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in HBSS
(Sigma)] plates.
DNA sample collection and sequencing
Beas2B and NCI-H441 cells were lysed to nuclear extraction
buffer (10 mmol/L Tris pH 7.4, 10 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40) and centrifuged for 5 minutes, 1,500  g, at
þ4 C to collect the nuclei. The nuclei were lysed to SDS lysis
buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 8.1)
and the samples were sonicated for 5 minutes (30–30 seconds
cycles) using Bioruptor UCD-200 instrument (Diagenode) and
centrifuged full speed for 10 minutes at more than 4 C. DNA

was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (JETquick, GENOMED) according to the kit protocol.
All coding exons for KEAP1 and exon2 for NFE2L2 were
ampliﬁed by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase
(M0530S, New England Bio Labs) and appropriate primers
from 2 recent publications (18, 24). Primers were synthesized
by TAG Copenhagen. PCR products were puriﬁed and analyzed
by sequencing at the DNA Sequencing Facility of the A.I.
Virtanen Institute, University of Eastern Finland (Kuopio,
Finland).
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich).
One microgram of the RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by
High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using relative standard curve
method (StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR systems, Applied Biosystems) with speciﬁc Assays-on-Demand target mixtures for
Nrf2 (Hs00232352_m1, Applied Biosystems) and Keap1
(Hs00202227_m1, Applied Biosystems).
Western blotting
Cells were lysed and protein concentrations were measured
with the BCA Kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were used
for electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane, blocked o/n in more than 4 C with 5% nonfat dry
milk in TBS-Tween, and incubated for 2 hours in room
temperature or o/n in þ4 C with the primary rabbit polyclonal
Nrf2 antibody (sc-13032, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), with the
rabbit polyclonal Keap1 antibody (cat. # 1050, Proteintech
Europe) or with the rabbit polyclonal b-actin antibody
(#4967L, Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were detected by
incubating the blots with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and by using ECL Plus
Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) with
Typhoon 9400 (GE Healthcare). Images were processed with
ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare).
Lentiviral constructs
The cloning of third generation lentiviral vectors, which
express the luciferase reporter gene under minimal SV-40
promoter (LV-control) or minimal SV-40 promoter together
with 4 AREs from human GCL modiﬁer subunit (LV-ARE-luc)
have been described elsewhere (25). Lentiviral ARE-TK (LVARE-TK) was cloned similarly but the luciferase gene was
replaced with HSV-TK (Fig. 3A). For cloning thymidine kinase
under constitutively active human phosphoglycerate kinase
(hPGK) promoter expressing lentiviral vector (LV-PGK-TK),
thymidine kinase gene from pUC-TGL-TK (26) was cloned to
pENTR-221 (Invitrogen) and further from this plasmid to the
lentiviral backbone using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen).
The lentiviral vector containing no transgene was used as a
control vector (empty virus) in MTT assays and in vivo (25).
Third generation lentiviruses were produced (27) and the
titer was assessed by HIV p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer). To test the
transduction efﬁciency, the construct expressing GFP under
hPGK promoter was used (28).

ARE-Regulated Lentiviral HSV-TK/GCV Gene Therapy

Luciferase assays
For the luciferase assay, 20,000 to 30,000 cells were plated
on black 96-well view plates (PerkinElmer). The transduction efﬁciency was assessed by transducing cells with GFP
expressing lentivirus and ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis as in ref. (28). Multiplicities of infection
(MOI) that yielded similar number of GFP-positive cells in
FACS analysis (85%) were used for transduction. For
Beas2B and A549 cells MOI 10 and for NCI-H441 MOI 20
were used to transduce with LV-control or LV-ARE-luc
constructs. Forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with
50 to 200 mmol/L diethylmaleate (DEM, Sigma), 50 to 100
mmol/L tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ, Sigma), 100 mmol/L
ganciclovir (Roche), or 100 to 500 nmol/L doxorubicin
(Sigma), and 16 hours later, luciferase assay was conducted
with Britelite Reporter Assay System (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Results were normalized to protein measured with the BCA kit. All data are
depicted relative to luciferase activity of LV-control.
Lentiviral HSV-TK/GCV therapy in vitro
A total of 20,000 to 30,000 cells were plated on 96-well
plates, and cells were transduced with empty virus, LV-ARETK or LV-PGK-TK. The next day, medium was changed and
24 hours later, cells were treated with 10 to 100 mmol/L
ganciclovir. Ganciclovir treatment was repeated 2 days later.
Five days after the ﬁrst ganciclovir treatment, the cell
survival was measured using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation-assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturers' instructions. When DEM was used in experiments, it was given 24 hours after transduction in 50 mmol/L
concentration together with ganciclovir and was repeated
with the ganciclovir treatment. Similarly, doxorubicin was
given 24 hours after the ﬁrst ganciclovir treatment using 1 to
500 nmol/L concentration, and again together with ganciclovir 48 hours later.
Lentiviral HSV-TK/GCV therapy in vivo
A549 cells were seeded on 10-cm plates and transduced with
empty virus, LV-ARE-TK or LV-PGK-TK using MOI 10 and
grown until near conﬂuent. Cells were washed once with PBS
(Sigma), trypsinized (Sigma), and pelleted by centrifugation.
Cell pellets were washed with Optimem (Gibco) and ﬁnally
suspended in a small volume of Optimem. Three million cells
were injected in 50 mL volume subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of
7-weeks old male NMRI nu/nu mice (Charles River). Two
tumors were injected per mouse. After 1 week, when the tumor
sizes were approximately 15 to 25 mm3, mice were given
ganciclovir (Roche) 50 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice
a day for 2 weeks. Control groups were injected with 0.9% NaCl.
Tumor sizes were measured twice a week, and tumor volumes
were calculated as 4/3  p  (a/2  b/2  c/2) in which a, b,
and c are tumor width, length, and height, respectively. After
ganciclovir treatment, mice were followed for additional 7
days, and were then sacriﬁced. All mice were kept in the
National Laboratory Animal Centre (Kuopio, Finland), and
the experimental procedure was approved by the National
Animal Experiment Board (Finland).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad
Prism Software. (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Statistical signiﬁcance of in vitro data was evaluated by paired t test and
for in vivo data 2-way ANOVA post hoc was used. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Results are expressed as
mean  SEM.

Results
Status of Keap1 and Nrf2 in Beas2B, NCI-H441 and
A549 cells
Recently, it has been shown that the transcription factor
Nrf2 is overexpressed in several lung cancer cell lines (16–
19). In A549 cells, a Gly!Cys amino acid change at the ﬁrst
Kelch domain of Keap1 (amino acid position 333) has been
identiﬁed (18), inhibiting Keap1 function and rendering Nrf2
overactive. The sequence of NFE2L2 has been shown to be
wild-type in A549 cells (24). The KEAP1 gene in Beas2B has
been found to be wild-type (18), but the sequence of NFE2L2
in these cells and both genes in NCI-H441 are not known. All
identiﬁed cancer mutations for NFE2L2 are clustered in
exon 2 in sites that are critical for the binding of Nrf2 to
Keap1 (29). Therefore, only exon 2 was sequenced in Beas2B
and NCI-H441 cells and was found to be wild-type in both
cell lines. The locations for KEAP1 mutations are more
evenly distributed throughout the gene, and the whole
KEAP1 gene was sequenced in NCI-H441. In NCI-H441,
KEAP1 exon 4 contained a synonymous substitution in
codon 471, which had no impact on the amino acid sequence
[CTC (Leu) ! CTG (Leu)].
Keap1 expression has been suggested to be regulated via
epigenetic mechanisms in human lung cancer cells and tissues
(30, 31). We therefore also assessed the mRNA and protein
expression of both Nrf2 and Keap1 in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 1A–E).
There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in Nrf2
mRNA expression between different cell lines (Fig. 1A), whereas Keap1 mRNA was signiﬁcantly lower in NCI-H441 cells in
comparison with Beas2B and A549 cells (Fig. 1B). In line with
previous reports (18, 32), Nrf2 protein is increased in comparison with Beas2B and NCI-H441 cells (Fig. 1C and E), whereas
the lowest Keap1 protein levels were found in A549 cells (Fig.
1D and F).
Basal and inducible ARE activities in Beas2B, NCI-H441,
and A549 cells
We then sought to evaluate the basal ARE activities in
Beas2B, A549, and NCI-H441, by transducing cells with the
LV-control or with the LV-ARE-luc reporter construct (Fig. 2A;
ref. 25). A549 cell line had the highest ARE activity, 26-fold
higher than the LV-control, whereas NCI-H441 cell line had the
lowest activity having only 2-fold increase in luciferase activity
in comparison with LV-control (Fig. 2B). The Beas2B control
cells had 5-fold ARE activity compared with LV-control.
Next, we examined whether it would be possible to further
increase the ARE activity in A549, NCI-H441, and Beas2B cells
by using Nrf2 activators tBHQ and DEM. The inducible ARE
activity was measured by transducing cells with either LVcontrol or LV-ARE-luc reporter construct, and by treating the

ARE-regulated HSV-TK/GCV therapy is effective in A549
and NCI-H441 cell lines in vitro
Inasmuch as in A549 cells, the constitutive ARE activity
was high, and in NCI-H441 cells, the ARE activity was highly
inducible by Nrf2 activators, we next assessed whether AREregulated vectors could be used to target suicide gene
therapy into lung cancer cells. To study this, we used an
established prodrug activating HSV-TK/GCV gene therapy
approach that has been successfully used to treat non–small
cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo (33, 34). To this end, we
cloned thymidine kinase into LV-ARE-luc by displacing
luciferase reporter gene with the HSV-TK gene (Fig. 3A),
and the vector was used to study the effect of ARE-regulated
HSV-TK/GCV therapy in vitro in A549 and in NCI-H441 cell
lines. Cells were transduced with an empty lentivirus containing no transgene (empty virus) or LV-ARE-TK. Two days

cells with different concentrations of DEM and tBHQ (Fig. 2C–
E). In A549 cells, in which the basal ARE activity was very high,
it was not increased by Nrf2 activators any further (Fig. 2E). In
contrast, in both Beas2B and NCI-H441 cells, in which the ARE
activity was low in basal conditions, the activity was increased
by both DEM and tBHQ (Fig. 2C and D).
We also examined the effect of ganciclovir and doxorubicin,
which were used in subsequent experiments, on ARE activity in
A549 and NCI-H441 cells. It was found that neither ganciclovir
nor doxorubicin had an effect on ARE activity in either cell line
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

after transduction cells were incubated with different concentrations of ganciclovir for 5 days, and the cell survival was
measured with the MTT assay. There was a concentrationdependent reduction of viability in LV-ARE-TK–transduced
A549 cells (Fig. 3B). With 100 mmol/L ganciclovir, less than
10% of cells were viable at the end of the study. Ganciclovir
treatment did not affect the viability of nontransduced cells
or cells transduced with empty virus (Fig. 3B).
In NCI-H441 cells, on the other hand, in which the basal ARE
activity is lower, LV-ARE-TK/GCV therapy was not as effective
as in A549 cells. Even after 100 mmol/L ganciclovir treatment,
almost 40% of cells were still viable (Fig. 3C).
ARE-regulated HSV-TK/GCV suicide therapy is more
efﬁcient than constitutive HSV-TK/GCV therapy in A549
cells but not in NCI-H441 cells in vitro
To compare the efﬁcacy of ARE-regulated HSV-TK/GCV
therapy with constitutive HSV-TK/GCV therapy, A549 cells or
NCI-H441 cells were transduced either with LV-ARE-TK or
with lentiviral vector expressing HSV-TK under the constitutively active hPGK promoter and treated as previously
described. In A549 cells, LV-ARE-TK was equally effective with
low ganciclovir concentrations and signiﬁcantly more effective
with higher concentrations than LV-PGK-TK (Fig. 3D).
In contrast, constitutive LV-PGK-TK/GCV therapy was
signiﬁcantly more effective than ARE-regulated TK/GCV therapy with all ganciclovir concentrations used in NCI-H441 cells
(Fig. 3E).

vector (LV-control) used to study ARE activity. The ARE construct contains 4 AREs from human GCL modiﬁer subunit, minimal SV40 promoter and
luciferase reporter gene, whereas the control has the minimal SV40 promoter and luciferase reporter gene only. B, basal ARE activities in each cell line
were measured by transducing cells with LV-control or LV-ARE-luc vectors, and luciferase activities were measured 48 hours later. Results were
normalized to protein and are presented as fold increase in luciferase activity in LV-ARE-luc versus LV-control, n ¼ 4, mean  SEM. C–E, for measuring
inducible ARE-activities Beas2B (C), NCI-H441 (D), and A549 (E) cells were transduced with LV-control or LV-ARE-luc vectors. DEM or tBHQ were
added to the culture medium 24 hours after transduction. Luciferase activities were measured the next day and were normalized to proteins. The data are
depicted relative to luciferase activity of nontreated cells transduced with LV-control, mean  SEM, n ¼ 4–6.

The combination of LV-ARE-TK/GCV therapy with DEM
in NCI-H441 cells or doxorubicin in A549 cells enhanced
the effect of LV-ARE-TK/GCV therapy
Because in NCI-H441 cells the ARE activity was highly
inducible with DEM and tBHQ, we next examined whether
50 mmol/L DEM could be used to increase the effect of AREregulated HSV-TK/GCV therapy. There was a small but signiﬁcant (with 10 mmol/L ganciclovir P ¼ 0.0451, with 50
mmol/L ganciclovir P ¼ 0.0197) increase in cytotoxicity when
10 or 50 mmol/L ganciclovir was used together with 50 mmol/L
DEM as compared with ganciclovir treatment alone, but no
further effect was seen when DEM was used together with 100
mmol/L ganciclovir (Fig. 4A).
In addition, we evaluated the efﬁcacy of doxorubicin chemotherapy combined with ARE-regulated TK/GCV suicide
therapy in A549 cells (Fig. 4B). Although doxorubicin has been
shown to increase cellular ROS formation (35), it did not
increase the ARE activity, assessed by the luciferase assay
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Doxorubicin at concentrations

in vivo using subcutaneous tumor model in NMRI nu/nu mice.
A549 cells were transduced with empty virus, LV-PGK-TK or
LV-ARE-TK, collected and injected subcutaneously into the
ﬂanks of nude NMRI nu/nu mice, 2 tumors per mouse. After 1
week, when tumors were approximately 20 mm3, ganciclovir
was injected i.p. twice a day 50 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Mice
were followed for another week and then sacriﬁced. In both
control groups (nontransduced cells and empty virus–transduced cells) tumors grew faster than in other groups in which
thymidine kinase was expressed (Fig. 5A and B). Interestingly,
LV-ARE-TK alone without ganciclovir caused a signiﬁcant
reduction of tumor growth in comparison with LV-PGKTK–transduced tumors (Fig. 5B), presumably because of the
high expression of transgene that occupies the transcriptional
and translational machinery, thus causing cytostasis. However,
the tumors were statistically signiﬁcantly smaller in size in
both LV-PGK-TK and LV-ARE-TK in mice receiving ganciclovir
in comparison with respective saline controls from day 17
onwards, and by day 28, there were no visible tumors left. In all
other groups, there were clearly visible tumors at the end of the
study.

with empty lentiviral vector containing no transgene (empty virus) or LV-ARE-TK vector using MOI 10. After 48 hours, ganciclovir was added to cell
culture medium and cells were incubated in the presence of ganciclovir for 5 days. Cell viability was measured with the MTT assay and is depicted as

enzymes and other prosurvival genes plays a pivotal role in
cancer chemoresistance (36). The growing list of cancer types
in which the Keap1–Nrf2 system has been shown to be
hyperactive includes lung (24), gall bladder (37), pancreatic
(38), hepatocellular (39), ovarian (40), and prostate (41) cancers. This is either due to mutations in KEAP1 or NFE2L2 genes,
accumulation of proteins that disrupt the Keap1–Nrf2 interaction, such as p62, or Keap1 promoter methylation resulting
in reduced Keap1 expression (reviewed in ref. 29). In A549 lung
cancer cells, both Keap1 promoter hypermethylation (30, 42)
and a point mutation in the Nrf2 interacting domain in KEAP1
(43) have been found. In this study, we sought to examine
whether dysregulation of the Keap1–Nrf2 system could be
exploited to therapeutic advantage by using the Nrf2-driven
ARE-element to drive the expression of the HSV-TK suicide
gene. The data presented herein show the feasibility and
efﬁcacy of such approach in cancer gene therapy.
Ideally, cancer gene therapy should affect only the cancerous
tissue having minimal or no effect on healthy and dividing cells.
Transcriptional targeting is one of the approaches in which the
selectivity is improved by using promoter elements that are
primarily active in cancer cells. With respect to gene therapy
using the HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene approach, tumor microenvironment-speciﬁc promoters that have been used for this
purpose include hypoxia response elements derived from the

6232

Cancer Res; 72(23) December 1, 2012

VEGF gene (44) and the glucose responsive hexokinase II
promoter (45). In addition, redox-responsive DNA motifs have
been used to regulate the HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene therapy in
cancer cells that have higher ROS levels than healthy cells (23).
ROS are produced also in normally dividing cells as a byproduct of cellular metabolism, but their production as well as
the activity of ROS-responsive promoters is increased in certain malignant cells, by 2- to 3-fold in comparison with healthy
cells assessed by the luciferase reporter assay (23). Similarly,
Nrf2 is broadly expressed also in healthy cells, but dysregulation of its activity results in a substantially higher basal activity
in A549 cells in comparison with Beas2B and NCI-H441 cells
(Fig. 1B), sufﬁcient to confer speciﬁcity to this treatment.
Remarkably, ARE-driven HSV-TK was more effective than
constitutively active PGK promoter in reducing viability in
HSV-TK/GCV gene therapy (Fig. 3D) in A549 cells in vitro,
showing the efﬁcacy of this approach. In vivo, both PGK-TK and
ARE-TK were equally effective, as the response to treatment
was complete in both groups treated with ganciclovir, with
complete disappearance of tumors in both groups by day 28.
In addition to the use of ARE in the regulation of transgene
expression in cells with high basal ARE activity, ARE-driven
vectors could be potentially used as an inducible vector system
regulated by Nrf2 activators. With respect to cancer, it is
interesting to note that certain anticancer agents (46) and

activity in our setting (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D) nor
effect on cell viability in control cells (Fig. 4B), substantially
enhanced the cytotoxic effect of ARE-HSV-TK (Fig. 4B). As
single agent cancer therapies often result in drug resistance
and are therefore less likely to be curative than combination
strategies targeting multiple pathways (48, 49), the synergistic
effect of the combination of doxorubicin with the ARE-HSV-TK
is therefore encouraging and suggests that this combination
could be used to enhance therapeutic efﬁcacy.
In conclusion, we have shown that ARE-regulated HSV-TK/
GCV therapy is a powerful option for cancer treatment in
cells with high constitutive Nrf2 expression. Furthermore,

ionizing radiation (47) cause a modest but measureable
increase in ARE activity, thus providing a possibility that
chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy could also be used
to boost the efﬁcacy of ARE-HSV-TK/GCV therapy. However,
in NCI-H441 cells in which the basal ARE activity is low but
highly inducible by commonly used ARE-activators DEM and
tBHQ, as assessed by the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 2C),
DEM treatment did not substantially enhance toxicity of the
ARE-HSV-TK/GCV therapy (Fig. 4A). Although it is possible
that factors, such as the selection of the inducing agent and
timing of administration were not optimal to maximize the
efﬁcacy of ARE-driven HSV-TK expression, it is unlikely that
the inducible ARE activation could be effectively used in vivo.
However, doxorubicin, which on its own had no impact on ARE
