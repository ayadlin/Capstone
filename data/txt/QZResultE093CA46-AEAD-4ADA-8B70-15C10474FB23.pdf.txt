BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves prostate cancer outcomes in specific clinical settings,
but is associated with adverse effects, including cardiac complications and possibly thromboembolic complications.
The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of ADT on thromboembolic events (TEs) in a populationbased cohort. METHODS: In the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results–Medicare database, we identified
men older than 65 who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1999 and 2005. Medical or surgical ADT was identified by Medicare claims for gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or bilateral orchiectomy at
any time following diagnosis. TEs included deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial embolism. The
impact of ADT on the risk of any TE and on total number of events was estimated, controlling for patient and tumor
characteristics. RESULTS: Of 154,611 patients with prostate cancer, 58,466 (38%) received ADT. During a median follow-up of 52 months, 15,950 men had at least 1 TE, including 8829 (55%) who had ADT and 7121 (45%) with no ADT.
ADT was associated with increased risk of a TE (adjusted hazard ratio ¼ 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-1.61; P <
.0001), and duration of ADT was associated with the total number of events (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort, ADT was associated with increased risk of a TE, and longer durations of ADT were associated
with more TEs. Men with intermediate- and low-risk prostate cancer should be assessed for TE risk factors before

starting ADT and counseled regarding the risks and benefits of this therapy. Cancer 2012;118:3397-406. V

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men, with more than 200,000 new cases in the United States in
2010.1 The majority of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer have localized disease and a favorable prognosis.2 Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or bilateral orchiectomy, is
widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer. The use of ADT has increased steadily in the last 2 decades among men
with all stages and grades of tumor, and primary ADT is the second most common treatment for men with localized prostate cancer.3,4 Its efficacy is clearly supported in men with metastatic disease.5 However, the benefit of ADT is less clear in
the nonmetastatic setting. Evidence from randomized trials supports the use of ADT in patients with high-risk localized
prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy.4 The role of ADT in the setting of intermediate- and low-risk prostate cancer, however, is not well defined.
For every prostate cancer patient considering ADT, the potential benefits of treatment must be weighed
against the risks. Men taking ADT often experience hormonal side effects such as hot flashes, loss of libido, and
erectile dysfunction.6,7 ADT is also associated with more serious adverse effects, including skeletal fractures, cardiovascular disease, insulin insensitivity, increased fat mass, and impaired cognition.8-11 Limited evidence also
suggests a relationship between ADT and thromboembolic complications such as deep venous thrombosis
(DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial embolism (AE).12 Thromboembolic events (TEs), while

treatable, are also potentially life-threatening. If men
taking ADT for prostate cancer are at increased risk
of thromboembolic disease, this risk must be considered when weighing the potential benefits and harms
of treatments. Our objective was to estimate the
impact of androgen deprivation on TEs in a population-based cohort of men with nonmetastatic prostate
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
The primary data source was the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare database, which links information
from the SEER cancer registry program with Medicare
claims and enrollment records. The SEER program collects data from 17 population-based cancer registries in
selected states and metropolitan areas covering 26% of the
US population. Medicare is the primary health insurer for
97% of Americans aged 65 years and older, and covers
inpatient hospital care (Part A) and outpatient care and
physician services (Part B). For all incident cancers, the
SEER registries collect information regarding site and
extent of disease, first course of cancer-directed therapy,
and sociodemographic characteristics, with active followup for vital status and cause of death.13 Compared with
the population of all US adults aged 65 years and older,
the SEER-Medicare population has a similar age and sex
distribution but has more residents of urban and affluent
areas and a smaller proportion of nonwhite individuals.13
The SEER-Medicare files were used in accordance with a
data-use agreement from NCI, and the study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Study Cohort
We identified all cases of nonmetastatic prostate cancer in
the SEER-Medicare database diagnosed between 1999
and 2005. The cohort was restricted to patients aged
66 years or older and who had been enrolled in Parts A
and B of Medicare for at least 1 year before diagnosis,
because information from the year prior to diagnosis was
necessary for estimating comorbidity. Patients diagnosed
only at the time of death were excluded, as were patients
who participated in a Medicare managed care plan at the
time of diagnosis or any time thereafter. Men who had
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis were excluded,
based on clinical extent-of-disease information in SEER.

Treatment
Medical and surgical ADT were identified by Current
Procedural Terminology codes for GnRH agonists and
bilateral orchiectomy in Medicare claims at any time after
diagnosis. Duration of ADT was categorized as <1 year,
1 to <3 years, and 3 years, based on the interval between
first and last claim for GnRH agonist. Surgical ADT was
included in the category of longest ADT duration
(3 years). Other prostate cancer treatments identified in
Medicare claims included surgery and radiation therapy
(see codes in Appendix ).
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was a TE, identified in Medicare
claims by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th
revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes for DVT, PE, or AE.
When a patient had a single claim with multiple diagnosis
codes indicating PE and 1 of either DVT or AE, the event
was classified as a PE. If a claim indicated both DVT and
AE without PE, the event was classified as an AE. For
analysis of the cumulative number of events per patient,
unique events were defined as those occurring at least
6 months apart.
Covariates
We examined several characteristics hypothesized to predict receipt of ADT or risk of TE and potentially confound the relationship between the two. Demographic
characteristics from SEER included age at diagnosis, race,
marital status, urban/rural location, and median income
in the census tract of residence. Disease characteristics
included clinical tumor stage, Gleason score, prostate
serum antigen level, and lymph node involvement.
Comorbidity was estimated using a modification of the
Charlson comorbidity index based on inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims in the year before prostate cancer diagnosis.14,15 We also identified patients at elevated
risk for TEs based on the presence of a diagnosis code for
stroke, ischemic heart disease, or a TE in the year prior to
cancer diagnosis.
Statistical Analysis
Unadjusted associations between exposure to ADT and
patient characteristics were examined using chi-squared
statistics. The impact of ADT on the risk of any TE was
evaluated in a time-to-event framework, where the time
origin was the date of prostate cancer diagnosis, and
patients who did not have an event were censored at the
time of death or end of follow-up. Multivariable Cox

proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the
impact of ADT on TEs, controlling for demographic, disease, and health characteristics. In regression analysis,
receipt of ADT and other treatments were analyzed as
time-dependent variables, with exposure to each treatment
identified at the time of the first Medicare claim for that
treatment. Hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals
(CIs), and 2-sided P values were estimated for each covariate. We performed stratified analyses to assess whether the
relationship between ADT exposure and the risk of a TE
varied by age at diagnosis, disease stage, grade or type of
ADT. We also repeated the analysis separating venous TEs
(PE and DVT) from arterial TEs (AE).
We examined the impact of duration of ADT on
both time to first TE and total number of TEs. In both
analyses, duration of ADT was categorized as <1 year, 1
to <3 years, or 3 years, based on the interval between
first and last claim for ADT. In the time-to-event framework, ADT duration was treated as a time-dependent
characteristic, varying for each patient based on his cumulative months of ADT exposure at each month, and the

3400

impact of ADT duration was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. The impact of
ADT on the total number of TEs was estimated using
multivariable negative binomial regression, stratified by
total cumulative ADT exposure. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC). Results are reported in adherence with STROBE
(Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology) guidelines.16

RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics
The study cohort included 154,611 men diagnosed with
nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1999 and 2005, of
whom 58,466 (38%) received ADT. In men who had
ADT, the median time from prostate cancer diagnosis to
initiation of ADT was 1.3 months, and 83% of those who
received ADT initiated therapy within 6 months of diagnosis. Men who received ADT were older and more likely
to live in nonmetropolitan areas and areas with lower

median income than men not receiving ADT (Table 1).
They also had higher clinical stage and Gleason score,
greater comorbidity, and were more likely to have an elevated risk for a TE due to a diagnosis of stroke, ischemic
heart disease, or TE in the year before cancer diagnosis.
Men who had ADT were also more likely to have received
radiation at some point after diagnosis. Only 2% of men
who received any ADT underwent orchiectomy. Among
the 57,009 men who had medical ADT, 56% received
ADT for <1 year, 26% for 1 to <3 years, and 19% for 3
years or more. The median number of Medicare claims
for GnRH agonist therapy was 2, 7, and 14 in each of
these categories, respectively.
Thromboembolic Events
During a median follow-up of 52 months, 15,950 men
(10.3%) had at least 1 TE, including 8829 (15%) of those
who had ADT and 7121 (7%) of those with no ADT
(Table 2). In men with a TE, 30% had more than 1 event,
and half of all TEs were DVTs. Approximately one-fourth
of all events were associated with an inpatient hospital
stay. At 4 years after diagnosis, TE-free survival was 87%
in men who had ADT and 94% in those who did not
(log-rank P < .0001). Controlling for patient and tumor
characteristics, comorbidity, and other cancer treatment,
exposure to ADT increased the risk of a TE by more than
50% (adjusted HR ¼ 1.56; 95% CI, 1.50 to 1.61; P <
.0001). The risk of a TE was also significantly increased
among older men, black men, those who received surgery
or radiation therapy, those with greater comorbidity, and
men who had had a diagnosis of stroke, ischemic heart
disease, or a TE in the year prior to cancer diagnosis
(Table 3).
ADT had a similar impact on the risk of a TE in
men younger than 75 years of age at diagnosis (adjusted
HR ¼ 1.54; 95% CI, 1.46-1.62) and in men aged 75 and
older (adjusted HR ¼ 1.59; 95% CI, 1.51-1.67). Results
were also similar when the cohort was stratified by prognosis. ADT increased the risk of a TE ADT increased the

Cancer

July 1, 2012

risk of a TE by 55% (95% CI, 1.49-1.60) in men with a
low risk of disease progression (clinical stage T2 and
Gleason score 6) and by 83% (95% CI, 1.71-1.96) in
men with a higher risk of disease progression (stage >T2
or Gleason score >6).
Patients who had surgical rather than medical ADT
should have the highest risk for TEs, because these
patients are exposed to constant castrate levels of androgen. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the
impact of ADT on the risk of a TE was greater in men
who had orchiectomy (adjusted HR compared with no
ADT ¼ 1.97; 95% CI, 1.72-2.26) than in men who had
androgen suppression by GnRH agonist (adjusted HR
compared with no ADT ¼ 1.54; 95% CI, 1.49-1.60).
ADT exposure was associated with both venous and arterial TEs, although the magnitude of the relationship was
somewhat attenuated when these endpoints were analyzed
separately. Controlling for other factors, ADT increased
the risk of a DVT or PE by 27% (95% CI, 1.21-1.32),
whereas it increased the risk of an AE by 18% (95% CI,
1.10-1.32).
Duration of ADT exposure was associated with both
the risk of a first TE and the total number of TEs
(Figure 1). Cumulative ADT exposure of <1 year increased
the risk of TE by 40% (95% CI, 1.33-1.45), 1 to <3 years
of ADT increased the risk by 66% (95% CI, 1.57-1.75),
and 3 or more years of ADT doubled the risk (95% CI,
1.90-2.19), compared with no ADT, controlling for
patient and disease characteristics, comorbidity, and other
cancer treatment (Figure 1A). The incidence rate ratio for
the impact of ADT on total number of TEs varied from
2.05 (95% CI, 1.89-2.23) in men exposed to <1 year of
ADT to 2.94 (95% CI, 2.61-3.32) in those with  3 years
of ADT or bilateral orchiectomy (Figure 1B).

with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, we found that ADT

was associated with the risk of TEs. Men exposed to ADT,
defined as GnRH agonist therapy or bilateral orchiectomy, had a greater risk of any TE after controlling for
demographic and disease characteristics and other cancer
treatments. Moreover, the risk of any TE and the total
number of TEs both increased with longer durations of
ADT.
Our results reinforce the findings of several prior
studies. In another population-based study using the
Swedish National Prostate Cancer Registry, men with
advanced prostate cancer had an increased risk of TEs
compared to a matched group of men without prostate
cancer.12 Among the men with prostate cancer, those
receiving primary ADT had the highest risk of venous
thrombosis.
The association of androgen deprivation with
increased risk of TEs has also been investigated in
other clinical settings. GnRH agonists have been associated with adverse metabolic effects, including
increased fat mass and decreased insulin sensitivity.17-19
In addition, androgen deprivation from GnRH agonist
therapy or orchiectomy has been associated with an
increased risk of developing diabetes.9,20 The impact of
these adverse physiologic effects can alter serum lipoproteins and lead to obesity and increased arterial stiffness which may increase the risk of TEs.21 In
preliminary experimental studies, the androgen receptor
on megakaryocytic cells has been shown to regulate
platelet activation, and androgen has been shown to inhibit arterial thrombosis.22,23

Figure 1. (A) The adjusted impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) duration on risk of first TE is shown, with ADT duration
analyzed as a time-dependent characteristic, varying for each patient based on his cumulative months of ADT exposure at each
month. Men who had surgical ADT were assumed to have continuous ADT exposure from the time of orchiectomy. Each category
of ADT duration was compared with no ADT. (B) The adjusted impact of ADT on total number of TEs is shown, estimated with
negative binomial regression, stratified by total cumulative ADT exposure. Men who had surgical ADT were included in the group
with 3 or more years of ADT exposure. Each category of ADT duration was compared with no ADT. All incidence rate ratios were
significant at the 0.0001 level.

In addition to ADT, both malignancy itself and host
factors have been associated with increased risk of thromboembolic disease.24-28 TEs are also common complications after surgical intervention, affecting 0.5% to 40% of
patients in the perioperative period.29 Although we could
not observe disease recurrences in the SEER-Medicare
data set, we excluded patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis and we controlled for important tumor characteristics, including clinical stage, histological grade,
preoperative prostate serum antigen level, and lymph
node status; patient characteristics such as age, general
comorbidity, and specific conditions associated with
thromboembolic disease; and other cancer treatments
including surgery. Adjusting for all of these factors, ADT
had an independent effect on the risk of thromboembolic
complications, increasing the risk of any event as well as
the total number of events. Death due to prostate cancer
was observed in fewer than 5% of patients who had a TE,
suggesting that tumor progression was unlikely to confound
the relationship between ADT and TE in this cohort.
The benefit of ADT, and thus the benefit/risk tradeoff, varies by disease severity. Men with high-risk prostate
cancer, defined by multifactorial risk prediction algorithms, have a significantly greater likelihood of biochemical relapse compared with those with more favorable
disease characteristics. Several randomized clinical trials
have demonstrated that ADT improves disease-specific
survival in men with high-risk prostate cancer who were
treated with radiation therapy.30-33 However, subgroup
analyses suggest no statistically significant survival benefit

in patients with low-risk disease.34 In men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer, ADT improves prognosis,
but survival differences appear to be mitigated by a
patient’s level of comorbidities.34 In patients treated
with radical prostatectomy, neoadjuvant ADT may
decrease the rate of positive surgical margins, but it has
not been shown to improve disease-free or overall survival.35 Separate from its effect on survival, the impact
of ADT on quality of life may be mixed. In a population-based sample of men with localized prostate cancer who received neither surgery nor radiation therapy,
those treated with ADT reported greater satisfaction
with their treatment decision, but greater physical discomfort than men who had no ADT.36
Even when the benefits of ADT are likely to outweigh the risks, the optimal duration of therapy is
uncertain. One randomized trial found greater overall
survival with 36 months of ADT compared with 6
months in men with high-risk prostate cancer who were
treated with radiation therapy.37 However, a pooled
analysis of patients enrolled in 3 randomized trials and
treated with long-term or short-term ADT and radiation therapy concluded that a longer duration of ADT
was not associated with improved survival.38 Moreover,
in a randomized trial of radiation therapy with or without ADT, patients who received long-term ADT had a
higher rate of noncancer deaths than patients on shortterm ADT.39
Our findings are relevant to individual patients, and
they also have important implications for public health

and the economic burden of prostate cancer. Although
prostate cancer accounts for a substantial fraction of new
cancer cases and deaths each year, most men are diagnosed at an early stage with a favorable prognosis. More
than 45% of patients will die of causes other than prostate cancer, and TEs are the second most common cause
of death among all patients with cancer.40,41 In 1999,
ADT was given to half of all prostate cancer patients and
accounted for one-third of Medicare expenditures for
prostate cancer treatment.3 However, use of ADT
appears sensitive to the level of reimbursement for physicians. Two studies showed a substantial decline in use after Medicare payments for ADT administration were
reduced.42,43
Several limitations of our analysis should be noted.
In this observational study, our findings demonstrate an
association between ADT and TEs, but we are limited in
our ability to infer causality. Although we were able to
control for numerous potential confounders, we could
not control for smoking history or body mass index,
which are 2 factors associated with thromboembolic complications. We also had no information regarding patient
preferences or physician recommendations for treatment,
or other factors which may be associated with both receipt
of ADT and with the underlying risk of TE. During the
years of our study, we could not identify another potential
confounder, oral anticoagulant therapy, in Medicare
claims. Finally, our results may not be generalizable to
patients with prostate cancer who are younger than 66
years of age.

Our results add to an expanding body of literature
that suggests concerns regarding ADT are warranted,
and the results emphasize the importance of identifying
those men at highest risk for complications and implementing strategies to prevent treatment-related morbidity. The implications of these findings prompt several
recommendations for patients with prostate cancer and
their physicians. First, men considering ADT should be
assessed for TE risk factors, such as obesity, smoking,
prolonged immobility, and personal history of stroke or
TEs, before starting therapy. Second, for men who initiate ADT, they and their physicians need to be aware of
and vigilant for thromboembolic complications. Most
importantly, the treatment decision-making process
should include a careful discussion, tailored to the individual patient based on his health and the characteristics
of his disease, of the expected benefits and potential
harms of ADT and other treatment options.
