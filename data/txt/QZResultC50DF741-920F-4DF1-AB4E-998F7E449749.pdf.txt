ABSTRACT
Hyperactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways and
chronic inflammation are common characteristics of oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC). Previously, we reported that OSCC cells secrete interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β),
which promotes the proliferation of the oral premalignant cell line, DOK, and stimulates
DOK and OSCC cells to produce the chemokine CXCL1. CXCL1 functions through CXCR2,
a G protein-coupled receptor that transactivates EGFR in ovarian and lung cancers.
We hypothesized that IL-1β transactivates EGFR through the CXCL1–CXCR2 axis in
OSCC. In this study, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR is crucial
for the IL-1β-mediated proliferation and subsequent bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
incorporation of DOK cells because the EGFR inhibitors AG1478 and erlotinib inhibit
these abilities in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of IL-1β instantly enhanced
CXCL1 expression and secretion (within 15 min) in the DOK and OSCC cell lines.
Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR was significantly enhanced in DOK
(1 h) and OSCC (20 min) cell lines after IL-1β treatment, and both cell lines were
inhibited on the addition of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). CXCL1 treatment
resulted in EGFR phosphorylation, whereas the knockdown of CXCL1 expression
by lentivirus-mediated shRNA or the addition of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002
dramatically reduced IL-1β-mediated EGFR phosphorylation and proliferation of
DOK cells. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-1β or CXCL1 markedly inhibited the
constitutive or IL-1β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in OSCC cells. IL1β transactivates EGFR through the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis, revealing a novel molecular
network in OSCC that is associated with autocrine IL-1β and EGFR signaling.

identified as a salivary biomarker for OSCC detection [4].
Consistent with this, in our previous study, we identified
that an increased IL-1β level was associated with the
increased severity of oral malignant transformation
in a mouse OSCC model [5]. In addition, we showed
that OSCC cell lines secrete a substantial amount of
IL-1β, which promotes tumor proliferation in an
autocrine manner. However, the mechanisms underlying
IL-1β-triggered OSCC proliferation have not been fully
elucidated.

INTRODUCTION
Among head and neck cancers (HNCs), oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) the sixth most common
cancer and is a rapidly growing health problem. Late
prognosis, lymph node metastasis, and recurrence lead
to a particularly poor 5-year survival rate [1]. Chronic
inflammation augments the initiation, promotion, and
progression of OSCC [2, 3]. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β),
a critical mediator of chronic inflammation, has been

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known
as ErbB1 or HER1) overexpression or activation is another
condition associated with OSCC. EGFR overexpression
has been reported in more than 80% of OSCCs [6, 7] and
occurs at the initial stage of carcinogenesis. EGFR is a
transmembrane glycoprotein with a cytoplasmic domain
that exhibits tyrosine kinase activity [8]. By regulating
downstream pathways, EGFR is vital for proliferation,
migration, and angiogenesis [9]. Shin et al. reported that
EGFR expression increases as the oral tissue progresses
from normal mucosa to hyperplasia to dysplasia, and
eventually to SCC [10]. Mak et al. demonstrated that a
high EGFR expression was observed in oral premalignant
(OPM) lesions, and EGFR gene copy number in OPM
cells is higher than that in normal mucosa [11]. In a study
cohort of 145 patients with OPM lesions, a high EGFR
expression was associated with increased oral cancer risk and
reduced time to oral cancer, suggesting a promoting role of
EGFR in oral malignant transformation and the prognostic
implication of EGFR expression [12]. In addition, activation
of EGFR signalling is associated with tumor aggression
events, such as metastasis and chemotherapy resistance,
and is a poor prognostic biomarker in oral cancer [13, 14].
Accordingly, EGFR is a promising target for treating oral
cancer. Cetuximab (erbitux) is a chimeric human-murine
anti-EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody and currently
approved in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
However, the overall increased response of adding cetuximab
to radiotherapy or chemotherapy is generally not higher than
20% [17, 18], and only few patients exhibit a long-term
response. The response on using cetuximab as a single agent
is lower than 13% response, and only a short-term response
(2–3 m) was observed [18]. Understanding the mechanism of
intrinsic EGFR activation in OSCC may help to identify new
molecular targets for treatment.
Previously, we showed that IL-1β activated an
oncogenic cytokine network in DOK cell line and TW2.6
OSCC cell lines by stimulating IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL1
production [5]. CXCL1 is a chemokine acting as an
oncogenic factor in several cancers, such as prostate cancer,
melanomas, and gliomas [19–21]. CXCL1 selectively binds
to CXCR2, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has
been shown to transactivate EGFR in ovarian cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer [22–24]. We hypothesize that IL-1β can
modulate EGFR activation through IL-1β-dependent CXCL1
expression which promotes carcinogenesis. To examine
our hypothesis, in this study, we investigated the effect of
IL-1β on EGFR activation and CXCL1 production in OSCC.

with OSCC. Previously, we demonstrated that DOK cells
treated with IL-1β (1 ng/mL) for 7 days (DOK-1β) exhibit
enhanced proliferative properties and Akt phosphorylation
[5]. The Akt pathway is one of the EGFR downstream
pathways strongly associated with cell proliferation;
therefore, we examined whether EGFR activities
were involved in IL-1β-mediated DOK proliferation.
As depicted in Figure 1A and 1C, increased DOK-1β
proliferation was confirmed on performing BrdU and
MTT assays, respectively. DOK-1β cells exhibited a dosedependent reduction on BrdU incorporation when cultured
with increasing doses of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) AG14778 (10 and 20 μM) and erlotinib (0.1 and 0.2
μM) (Figure 1B). The inhibitory effect of AG14778 and
erlotinib on the proliferative properties of DOK-1β cells
was confirmed using the MTT assay (Figure 1D). These
results suggested that activation of the EGFR signaling
pathway is involved in the IL-1β-mediated proliferation
of DOK cells.

IL-1β transactivates EGFR and stimulates
CXCL1 expression in DOK and OSCC cell lines
To examine whether IL-1β induces EGFR
activation, we performed western blotting analysis for
tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in DOK and OSCC
cells after IL-1β treatment. As shown in Figure 2A, a
marked increase in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was
observed in DOK cells 1 hour after IL-1β addition. EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-1β increased
significantly above basal levels in the TW2.6 and OC3
cells at 20 and 10 minutes, respectively. In both OSCC
cell lines, IL-1β-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
further increased at 40 minutes (Figure  2A). Notably,
intrinsic EGFR activation was more intense in the
OC3 cells, in which IL-1β secretion is high, than in
the TW2.6 cells, in which IL-1β secretion is low [5].
To verify the inductive effect of IL-1β in EGFR activation,
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation of DOK and OC3 cells
was measured after a 2-h preincubation with 0.5 μg/mL
of IL-1Ra followed by IL-1β treatment for 40 minutes.
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-1β
was markedly inhibited by the IL-1Ra in DOK and OC3
cells (Figure 2B). This suggests that EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation in response to IL-1β is primarily
governed by IL-1 receptor signaling.
To investigate whether IL-1β induces EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation through CXCL1-CXCR2
axis, we examined the effect of IL-1β on the CXCL1
expression and secretion. We measured the CXCL1
mRNA expression in DOK, TW2.6, and OC3 cells within
40 min after IL-1β (1 ng/mL) addition. In the DOK cells,
upregulated CXCL1 expression was observed 20 and
40 minutes after IL-1β addition (Figure 3A). CXCL1
expression was markedly upregulated in IL-1β-treated
TW2.6 and OC3 cells immediately after IL-1β addition

5 × 103 (MTT assay) cells per well on 96-well plates. The next day, cells were treated with DMSO (controls), AG1478, and erlotinib at the
indicated concentrations. After a 4-hour treatment, cells were cultured in a normal growth medium, and proliferation assays were performed
either after 1 day of treatment, using the BrdU assay, or after 2 and 5 days of treatment, using the MTT assay. Data are expressed as mean
± SD of three independent experiments, where each experiment has been performed in six replicates. *P ≤ 0.01 versus untreated controls.

(5 min after addition) and a gradual increase was further
observed (Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, IL-1β
induced CXCL1 expression in a dose-dependent manner
and was inhibited by IL-1Ra (2-h preincubation with 0.5
μg/mL of IL-1Ra, Figure 3C). CXCL1 belongs to a group
of highly secreted proteins. DOK, TW2.6, and OC3 cell
supernatants were analyzed using ELISA for CXCL1
protein secretion after 15 min incubation with 1 ng/mL of
IL-1β with or without pretreatment with 0.5 μg/mL of IL1Ra. As shown in Figure 3D, IL-1β markedly upregulated
CXCL1 protein secretion in TW2.6 and OC3 cells (15 min
after addition). In the DOK cells, the CXCL1 secretion
after IL-1β addition was unchanged at 15 minutes but
increased significantly at 30 minutes. These results are
consistent with our previous observations, in which the
EGFR phosphorylation in the TW2.6 and OC3 cells
significantly increased 20 minutes after IL-1β addition;
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

however, no significant increase was observed until 40 and
60 minutes in the DOK cells (Figure 2A). Preincubation
with IL-1Ra resulted in a drastically reduced CXCL1
secretion in all cell types. Overall, these data suggest that
IL-1β stimulates CXCL1 expression and secretion in DOK
and OSCC cells and, in turn, transactivates EGFR through
the CXCL1–CXCR2 axis.

Expression of IL-1β, CXCL1, and CXCR2
in OSCC
In our previous study [5], we demonstrated IL-1β
upregulation in mouse OSCC. If IL-1β could induce
CXCL1 production in vivo, CXCL1 and IL-1β may
be coexpressed in OSCC biopsies. We thus examined
whether CXCL1 was expressed in IL-1β-positive OSCC.
We surveyed the publicly available microarray studies

in the Oncomine database (www.oncomine.org) and
observed that IL-1β and CXCL1 were upregulated in
tumor samples compared with normal tongue and normal
buccal mucosa samples (P < 0.001 for both) (Figure 4A)
[25, 26]. Immunohistochemical examination and
quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were conducted.
We observed that IL-1β and CXCL1 coexpressed in
mouse OSCC samples (Figure 4B) and human OSCC
cell lines (Figure 4C). Notably, both IL-1β and CXCL1
were undetectable in normal mouse oral tissues (data
not shown). Supporting this finding, DOK cell line
expressed lower IL-1β and CXCL1 levels than the
other OSCC cell lines tested (Figure 4C). To determine
CXCR2 expression in OSCC cells, quantitative RT-PCR,
immunofluorescent staining, and western blot analysis
and were performed. Our data indicated that CXCR2
mRNA was expressed in all the cell lines examined
(Figure 4C), and CXCR2 proteins were detected in DOK,
TW2.6, and OC3 cells (Figure 4D). Results from western
blotting identified that CXCR2 presents in cytoplasmic
membrane of TW2.6 and OC3 cells (Figure 4E). Overall,
these results not only support IL-1β-induced CXCL1
expression but also suggest that CXCL1 could exert its
activity of EGFR transactivation by binding to CXCR2
in DOK and OSCC cells.

To investigate the role of the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis
in IL-1β-mediated EGFR activation, we examine whether
CXCL1 induces EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in DOK and
TW2.6 cells. In the DOK cells, an increased (approximately
1.5-fold high) EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was observed
at 15 min and further EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was
observed at 120 min (Figure 5A). In the TW2.6 cells, a
reduction in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was observed
at 5 min, followed by a gradual induction of approximately
3-fold at 120 min (Figure 5B).
We then investigated whether CXCL1 contributed to
IL-1β-mediated proliferation. DOK cells were infected with
lentivirus carrying a CXCL1-targeting shRNA (shCXCL1)
or nontargeting vector control (shCtrl) construct expressing
a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and puromycin resistant
gene. Cells were treated with puromycin for at least 2
weeks to ensure that the majority of cells (up to 95%)
expressed the lentivirus constructs, which were assessed by
GFP expression (Supplementary Figure S1A). Reduction
in CXCL1mRNA expression and protein secretion
were verified (Supplementary Figures S1B and S1C,

respectively). The proliferation of nontargeting control
cells (DOK-shCtrl) was slightly higher on IL-1β (1 ng/mL)
addition than that of the uninfected (DOK) cells, whereas
the inhibition of CXCL1 expression (DOK-shCXCL1)
markedly reduced IL-1β-mediated DOK proliferation to
35% and 68% on day 4 and day 6, respectively, compared
with the DOK-shCtrl cell proliferation after IL-1β addition
(Figure 6A). Consistent with the MTT assay results, the
BrdU assay revealed that, the BrdU incorporation rates in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the DOK and DOK-shCtrl cells were significantly increased
in response to IL-1β treatment (Figure 6B). In the presence
of IL-1β, the BrdU incorporation rate in the DOK-shCXCL1
cells was lower than that in the DOK-shCtrl and DOK cells.
In the absence of IL-1β (untreated), no significant difference
was observed in the BrdU incorporation rate among the
DOK-shCXCL1, DOK-shCtrl, and DOK cells (Figure 6B).
These results indicated that CXCL1 contributed to IL-1βmediated proliferation of DOK cells.

were used as molecular markers for CM+C and Nu fractions, respectively.

CXCL1-CXCR2 axis is required for IL-1βmediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation

control cells. These results indicated that CXCL1 was
involved in the IL-1β-mediated phosphorylation of
EGFR. We then used the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002
to determine whether CXCL1 functions through CXCR2
to regulate IL-1β-mediated EGFR phosphorylation.
TW2.6, an OSCC cell line with a relatively low level
of endogenous IL-1β, was pretreated with SB225002
(200 nM) for 20 min, followed by IL-1β treatment for
20 min before EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation analysis.
As shown in Figure 7B, the TW2.6 cells treated with
SB225002 exhibited a 45% reduction in IL-1β-mediated
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas EGF-induced
EGFR phosphorylation was unaffected by SB225002
treatment, indicating that CXCR2 was involved in
IL-1β-mediated EGFR phosphorylation but not in that

We showed that both CXCL1 and CXCR2 were
expressed in DOK and OSCC cells (Figures 4C–4E), and
CXCL1 could induce EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
(Figure 5). Therefore, we next investigated whether the
CXCL1-CXCR2 axis was responsible for IL-1β-mediated
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in DOK and OSCC cells.
As shown in Figure 7A, lentivirus shRNA significantly
inhibited IL-1β-induced CXCL1 expression. This reduction
resulted in a significant reduction in the basal level and
IL-1β-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas
IL-1β-induced EGFR phosphorylation and CXCL1
expression remained markedly high in the nontargeting

induced by EGF. The OC3 cells, which highly secrete
IL-1β, were preincubated with SB225002 (200 nM) for
20 min before estimating EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
by western blotting. As shown in Figure 7C, the constitutive
EGFR phosphorylation of OC3 cells was significantly
inhibited by SB225002, suggesting that CXCR2 signaling
contributes to the intrinsic EGFR activation of this
IL-1β-secreting cell line. EGF increased the phosphorylation
of EGFR by 1.9- ± 0.2-fold compared with that at the
basal level. Preincubation of SB225002 reduced EGFR
phosphorylation in EGF-treated OC3 cells, which might
be possibly because of IL-1β-mediated constitutive
EGFR phosphorylation inhibition by SB225002. Overall,
these results suggested that the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis
was responsible for the IL-1β-mediated EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation in DOK cells and OSCC.
To confirm the role of IL-1β and CXCL1 in
the EGFR activation of OSCC, we inhibited their
biological activities by using neutralizing antibodies to
examine the effect of these molecules on EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation. OC3 or TW2.6 cells were incubated with
neutralizing antibodies against IL-1β, CXCL1, or both for
4 hours. Subsequently, TW2.6 cells alone were treated
with IL-1β (1 ng/mL) for 30 minutes. The incubation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

neutralizing antibodies against IL-1β (20 or 40 μg/mL)
or CXCL1 (1.5 or 3 μg/mL) in the high IL-1β-secreting
OC3 cells inhibited constitutive EGFR phosphorylation
in a dose-dependent manner, and the combined use of
two antibodies was more effective than that of a single
antibody in inhibiting constitutive EGFR phosphorylation
(Figure 8A). In the high CXCL1-secreting TW2.6 cells
(Figure 4C), the incubation of neutralizing antibodies
against CXCL1 (5 μg/mL) inhibited the IL-1β-mediated
EGFR phosphorylation significantly, and the neutralizing
antibodies against IL-1β (50 μg/mL), alone or in
combination with anti-CXCL1 (5 μg/mL), inhibited IL1β-mediated EGFR phosphorylation (Figure 8B). These
results suggested that IL-1β and CXCL1 contribute to
constitutive and IL-1β-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR
in OC3 and TW2.6 cells, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Chronic inflammation is associated with the
development of OSCC. We previously identified that IL1β secretion is high in OSCC cells, and IL-1β is involved
in the initial and late stages of oral malignancy [5]. In this
study, we showed that IL-1β induces CXCL1 production,

which in turn activates EGFR through CXCR2, causing a
proliferative response of oral premalignant cells (Figure 9).
Our findings revealed a novel oncogenic pathway for
OSCC-associated risk factors. In this cancer-promoting
process, IL-1β and CXCL1-CXCR2 have crucial regulating
roles in integrating inflammation stimuli and an EGFR
signaling cascade. The CXCL1-CXCR2 axis may serve
as a transmitter to transduce the inflammasome-derived
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IL-1β signal into the signal network modulated by EGFR.
Because of the involvement of dysregulated EGFR
signaling and an inflammatory microenvironment in oral
tumorigenesis, converging these 2 oncogenic events has a
profound effect on the etiology of OSCC and the clinical
management of this cancer.
As a crucial determiner of inflammation, the
biological processes of IL-1β secretion are tightly regulated.

Both activating NF-κB and inflammasomes are essential
for the production of IL-1β [27, 28]. An inflammasome
is formed by multiprotein complex including pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) which sense and respond
to conserved pathogen motifs and endogenous molecules
released upon cell damage or stress [27]. Thus, according
to our findings, a broad spectrum of pathogens or molecules
recognized by the PRRs could induce the EGFR signaling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cascade through trigger IL-1β production, and such that the
cascade exerts its tumor-promoting role. Our previous work
demonstrated that NNK induces IL-1β production in OSCC
cells [5]. Lemjabbar et al provided supporting evidence for
our hypothesis [29]. Their work associated EGFR signal
transactivation with increased cell proliferation in human
lung carcinoma in response to cigarette smoking. According
to our findings, cigarette smoking could possibly induce

observed in human cancer. Transactivation of EGFR by
GPCR agonists has been demonstrated in HNCS cell lines
by Gschwind et al [30]. CXCR2 is activated by cancerpromoting IL-8 and CXCL1 and could transactivate EGFR
in ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer [22–24].
This receptor has been shown to be widely expressed
in patients with OSCC [39] and has been reported to be
crucial for aggressive phenotypes of this cancer [31–33].
Our data demonstrate that CXCR2 contributes to IL-1βmediated EGFR transactivation in OSCC and may provide
an explanation for the oncogenic effect of CXCR2 in
this cancer. Additionally, increasing evidence shows a
direct correlation between aberrant GPCR signaling and
the onset of hyperproliferative disorders [30, 34, 35]. As
increased proliferation may be a critical initiation step
in carcinogenesis, the promoting effect of IL-1β on the
proliferation of DOK cells is meaningful to oral malignant
transformation. We showed that the IL-1β-mediated EGFR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transactivation involving the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis was
implicated in DOK proliferation in the presence of IL-1β
(Figure 1 and 6). These results suggest that the CXCL1CXCR2 axis-targeting therapy could be considered a
prevention strategy for patients with chronic inflammatory
oral lesions from developing OSCC.
In the OC3 cell line, following the strong IL1β-induced activation within 40 minutes, the EGFR
phosphorylation attenuated 60 minutes after IL-1β
addition (Supplementary Figure S2), and the CXCL1
levels remained high simultaneously. This trend may be
explained by a negative feedback regulation mechanism
of EGFR in this cell line. Er et al., [36] reported that Aktmediated endocytic trafficking of EGFR for promoting its
degradation is likely to be a common feedback mechanism
for terminating EGFR signaling and reducing receptor
abundance. In our previous study [5], IL-1β stimulated
Akt activation in DOK and OSCC cells, thus facilitating a
negative feedback regulation mechanism. In addition, some
other negative regulators of EGFR may be induced by the
strong activation of its downstream signaling pathways.
Wang et al. [37] demonstrated that PHLDA2 was robustly
induced by the EGFR signaling pathways, and PHLDA2
mediates a negative feedback loop, inhibiting the activation
of EGFR and Akt. The regulation network of EGFR in OC3

cells warrants further investigation. CXCL1 expression is
markedly upregulated by MAPK/ERK signaling in human
decidua [38]. This finding is consistent with that of our
study, in which the intrinsic and IL-1β-induced-CXCL1
expression was abolished by the MAPK inhibitor U0126
in DOK and TW2.6 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A).
Furthermore, intrinsic phosphorylated Erk1/2 were higher
in the TW2.6 cells than in the OC3 cells (Supplementary
Figure S3B), and this may have resulted in the high
CXCL1 expression in TW2.6 cells, despite lower IL-1β
levels in the TW2.6 cells than in the OC3 cells (Figure 4C).
Therefore, although the IL-1β antibodies neutralized IL1β in the culture medium and suppressed IL-1β-induced
CXCL1 production, the tyrosine phosphorylation of
EGFR stimulated by the intrinsic activated CXCL1CXCR2 axis remains substantial in the TW2.6 cells
(Figure 8B). Furthermore, SB225002 or neutralizing
antibodies against CXCL1 reduced IL-1β-mediated EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation more efficiently compared with
IL-1β antibodies (Figures 7B and 8B). These findings
imply that a CXCL1–CXCR2 axis-targeted drug may
overcome EGFR activation more efficiently compared
with an IL-1β-targeted regimen under therapeutic
intervention. In mammalian cells, at least seven ligands
for EGFR have been identified: EGF, TGF-α, HB-EGF,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

amphiregulin, betacellulin, epigen, and epiregullin. HBEGF is synthesized in a soluble, membrane-anchored form
(pro-HB-EGF) and binds to EGFR through ectodomain
shedding. Takenobu et al. [39] reported that IL-1β triggered
ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF in vero cells. This
mechanism may occur in OSCC cells and explain why the
CXCR2 inhibitor SB225002 cannot completely inhibit IL1β-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Figure 7B).
Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that EGFlike growth factors other than HB-EGF can be induced by
IL-1β and can account for the prolonged EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation after SB225002 treatment.
EGFR is considered a suitable drug target for OSCC
treatment because the majority of OSCC cells overexpressed
EGFR [40], and high EGFR tumor levels are associated
with poor clinical outcomes [41]. However, several clinical
trials on EGFR-targeted therapies, including EGFR-directed
antibodies and TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib,
have reported that only a small subset of patients with OSCC
responded to these treatments [42–44]. Several resistance
mechanisms to EGFR inhibitors are clinically validated in
lung and colon cancers and are likely applicable to OSCC.
These recognized resistance mechanisms to EGFR-targeted
therapies may be classified into four categories [45]: target
modification, an EGFR mutation to a drug-resistant state.

RNA extraction and real-time quantitative
PCR (qPCR)

In several patients with non-small cell lung cancer, resistance
develops through an acquired activating EGFR mutation,
T790M [46]; oncogenic shift or accessory pathway activation
[47], such as MET amplification, KRAS activation, and
PI3K-Akt pathway mutations; PIK3CA mutations have been
associated with resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal
antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancers.
PIK3CA mutations were identified in up to 57.1% of OSCC
lines and 16.7% of OSCC tumors [49]; and impairment of
the apoptotic pathway essential for EGFR TKI-mediated
apoptosis, such as germline BIM deletion [50], histological
transformation, or an epithelial–mesenchymal transition
[51]. Current clinical approaches to overcome resistance in
lung adenocarcinoma are the use of irreversible and mutantselective EGFR inhibitors, and combining an EGFR inhibitor
with a drug targeting a resistance pathway, such as the
combination of erlotinib and an MET inhibitor. According
to our model, upregulated IL-1β and CXCL1 expression
may provide a rationale for constitutive EGFR activation
frequently observed in OSCC, and, therefore, IL-1β and
CXCL1 are promising molecular markers for identifying
OSCC patients who respond to EGFR-targeted therapy.
In addition, a combination of EGFR TKIs with a regimen
targeting the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis may be a promising
therapeutic strategy for OSCC patients with over-expressed
EGFR.
Future investigation must aim at identifying the
molecules responsible for EGFR transactivation caused
by CXCR2 in OSCC. Because evidence indicates
the importance of EGFR signal transactivation and
inflammation in this malignancy, fully elucidating these
signaling mechanisms will provide further insight into oral
carcinogenesis, and the components involved represent
promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

Extraction of cellular total RNA, synthesis of
cDNA from total RNA and qPCR were performed as
previously described [5, 53]. The primer sequences for
qPCR are as follows: 5′-TCCTGCATCCCCCATAGTTA-3
(forward) and 5′-CTTCAGGAACAGCCACCAGT-3′ for
human CXCL1; 5′-GAGGCACAGTGAAGACATCG-3′
(forward) and 5′-GCTGGGCTTTTCACCTGTAG-3′for
human CXCR2; and 5′-CCAACCGCGAGAAGATGA-3′
(forward) and 5′-CCAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAG-3′ for
β-actin (ACTB). The primer sequences for human proIL-1β were as previously described [5].

Knockdown of CXCL1
For knockdown of CXCL1 expression, we
purchased GIPZ lentivirus particles carrying shRNA
specifically targeting CXCL1 from Dharmacon. To cell
infection, 50% confluent of DOK cells were incubated
with lentivirus for 6 hour, and the medium containing
puromycin (5 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was replaced to
select stable cell pools for at least 2 weeks before usage.
Cells infected with lentivirus with empty vector (shCtrl)
were used as controls.

MTT proliferation assay

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were seeded at 1 × 103 per well on 96-well
plates. 10 μl of MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide], 5 mg/ml, SigmaAldrich) was added to each well at indicated time; the
cells were further incubated for 4 hour at 37°C and then
subcultured in the medium with 100 μl of DMSO. The
absorbance at 540 nm was measured on a micro ELISA
reader (Bio-Rad).

Chemicals

BrU cell proliferation assay

AG1478, Erlotinib, and SB225002 were purchased
from ApexBio, Biovision, and Enzo Life Science,
respectively. Recombinant human IL-1β, CXCL1, and IL1Ra was purchased from R&D System. Western blotting
analysis was performed using antibodies against human
EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) (Y1068) (Cell
Signaling). Neutralizing antibodies experiments were
performed using antibodies against human IL-1β (Acris
Antibodies) and human CXCL1 (RayBiotech).

Cells were seeded in five replicates in 96-well plates
at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. After adhesion, cells
were cultured in a standard culture medium or treated
with indicated concentrations of AG1478 or erlotinib or
vehicle alone as control for 4 hours. Cell proliferation was
evaluated by measuring BrU incorporation during DNA
synthesis according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Merck Millipore). BrDU incorporation was measured
using chemiluminescence (absorbance: 450 nm).

Immunohistochemistry
The tongue tissues were fixed overnight in formalin,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm thickness.
Sections were deparaffined and rehydrated using a
xylene-alcohol series protocol. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched using 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxidemethanol (1:1 v/v) solution at room temperature for 10
minutes. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed
in citrate buffer(0.01 M, pH6.0) at pressure cooker (Cell
Marque) to expose antigen for 15 min. Sections were then
incubated overnight at 4°C with either of the following
primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-1β (1:500,
Abcam) and rabbit polyclonal anti-CXCL1 (1:1000,
Abcam). A peroxidase-conjugated polymer reagent
(REAL™ EnVision™ Detection System, DAKO) with a
diaminobenzidine (DAB, DAKO) chromogen was then
used to develop the stain. Sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin and then dehydrated and mounted.
Controls consisted of omission of the primary antibody.
