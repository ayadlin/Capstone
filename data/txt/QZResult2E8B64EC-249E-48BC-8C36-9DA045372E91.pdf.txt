New Developments in Mammalian Target of
Rapamycin Inhibitors for the Treatment of
Sarcoma
Mark Agulnik, MD

Although sarcomas account for a small portion of solid malignancies, currently, there are few treatment options for
sarcomas, particularly for advanced disease. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine protein
kinase in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine/threonine protein kinase Akt signaling pathway, has an important
role in the regulation of protein synthesis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metabolism. Alterations of the mTOR
signaling pathway are common in malignancies, including several types of sarcoma. Therefore, mTOR is a potentially
important therapeutic target in these diseases. Rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) are effective anticancer agents
in a broad range of preclinical models. Clinical trials with these agents alone and in combination with other anticancer
agents, including chemotherapy and targeted therapies, have demonstrated potential clinical benefit in several types
of sarcoma. The evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies supports further study of mTOR-targeting rapaC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Sarcomas are a group of heterogeneous tumors that originate from mesenchymal tissue. In the United States, sarcomas account for approximately 1% of all adult solid malignancies and approximately 15% of pediatric cancers.1 In 2010,
an estimated 13,170 new cases of soft tissue and bone sarcomas were diagnosed, resulting in 5380 deaths in the United
States.2,3 Currently, few options exist for the treatment of sarcomas. Standard therapy includes surgery, chemotherapy,
and radiotherapy; the most frequently used treatment for advanced disease is chemotherapy with anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin), alkylating agents (eg, ifosfamide and dacarbazine), and platinum compounds (eg, cisplatin and carboplatin), or
combinations of these agents.4 Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a unique subtype of soft tissue sarcoma (STS)
and can be treated with surgery and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib and sunitinib; the primary therapy
for advanced metastatic/unresectable GIST is imatinib.1
Aberrant activity in several molecular pathways has been linked to the pathogenesis of various sarcoma subtypes.
Mahalingam et al recently published an in-depth review of the molecular alterations in sarcomas, which include the upregulation or mutational activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (KIT, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor [IGF-1R],
epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], and platelet-derived growth factor receptor) and members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/threonine protein kinase Akt (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway; loss or
deletions of tumor suppressor genes (eg, retinoblastoma, p53, and phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN]); increased
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway expression and angiogenesis; mutations, amplification, or overexpression of oncogenes (eg, the v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog [c-Myc], Ras, and the v-src sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog [Src]); and dysregulation of apoptosis through B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2

(Bcl-2) overexpression.4 The characterization of these molecular pathways has led to the development of novel targeted biologic therapies as treatment options.
Mammalian target of rapamycin, a serine/threonine
kinase that has a pivotal role in the control of cell growth,
metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell survival through
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, is considered an important target for anticancer drug development.5-8 Although
sirolimus (rapamycin), the first mTOR inhibitor discovered, initially was developed as an immunosuppressive
agent, preclinical studies in both in vitro and xenograft
models have demonstrated that sirolimus inhibits the
growth of several murine and human cancer cell lines.9
On the basis of these results, further studies have examined the potential role of sirolimus as an anticancer agent.
Derivatives of rapamycin with improved pharmacokinetics and reduced immunosuppressive effects have been
developed (ie, temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus) and currently are under clinical investigation.9,10
This article briefly describes the mTOR pathway and its
role in cancer and reviews data from preclinical and clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors, specifically those being
investigated in sarcoma.
The Mammalian Target of Rapamycin
Pathway
Mammalian target of rapamycin is a member of the PI3Kkinase related kinase superfamily.11,12 Human mTOR
exists in 2 different multiprotein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), consisting of mTOR, mTOR complex
subunit LST8 (mLST8), and regulatory-associated protein
of mTOR (raptor); and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2),
composed of mTOR, mLST8, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (rictor), and mammalian stress-activated
protein kinase-interacting protein 1 (mSin1).12 Of the 2
complexes, mTORC1 has been studied more extensively
and reportedly regulates most mTOR effects on protein
synthesis and gene expression associated with cell growth,
metabolism, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell survival. The role of mTORC2 is less understood, but reports
suggest that mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt in the PI3K/
Akt pathway and regulates the organization of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 1).6-8,13,14 The activity of mTOR is regulated by
growth factors and their receptors, which transmit signals
through the PI3K/Akt and Ras pathways.9 Members of the
EGFR family (eg, EGFR, human epidermal growth factor
2), IGF, and VEGF receptors stimulate mTOR activity
through the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ras
homolog enriched in brain.9 Signals generated by these

receptors are regulated by PTEN, which inhibits PI3K signaling; neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1), a tumor suppressor that reduces Ras activity; and tuberous sclerosis
complex (TSC1) and TSC2, which form a complex to
block the activation of mTOR.11 The activity of mTOR
also is regulated by cellular stress—when intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels are depleted, the adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase is activated
through the tumor suppressor LKB1 (serine threonine kinase 11). Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase subsequently activates another tumor suppressor,
TSC1/TSC2, thereby leading to mTOR inactivation.10,14
The activation of mTOR stimulates at least 2 downstream effectors: 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP-1)/4E-BP2 and ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 and 2, which function in translational control to regulate mammalian cell
size.15 Mammalian target of rapamycin signaling leads to
the expression of several proteins12,16-18: c-MYC, cyclin
D, and ornithine decarboxylase, which is involved in the
G1 to S transition during cell proliferation7; hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), which is involved with metabolism and angiogenesis19,20; VEGF and fibroblast
growth factor (FGF), which also are associated with
angiogenesis19,20; ribosomal proteins, poly(A)-binding
protein, and elongation factors, which are part of the cellular translational machinery involved in protein synthesis
and ultimately cell growth17,18,21; and the growth factor
IGF-2.12,22 Because of the complex network of downstream effects linked to the activation of mTOR, dysregulation of the pathway is linked to several malignancies.9
Mammalian Target of Rapamycin
Up-Regulation and Down-Regulation
in Sarcoma
Abnormal mTOR activity, including the dysregulation of
members of its pathway (such as growth factor receptors
and tumor suppressors),9 has been documented in several
tumor types, including colorectal, lung, and breast
cancers.21,23 Overexpression of growth factor receptors
or mutation of their associated receptor tyrosine kinases leads to increased signaling through the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway. In some sarcoma subtypes, specifically rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, Ewing
sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and osteosarcoma, members of the epidermal growth factor family (including
IGF-1R and its ligands, IGF-1 and IGF-2) reportedly
are overexpressed.12,24-26 The up-regulation of other
receptor tyrosine kinases, such as FGF receptor and
EGFR, also have been reported in Ewing sarcoma,

of the tumor suppressors TSC1/TSC2 and NF1 are associated with both benign sarcoma-like tumors, such as
angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, rhabdomyomas, neurofibromas, hamartomas, and schwannomas, and malignant sarcomas, such as malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors.14,29-32 Because of the key
role of mTOR in regulating these pathways, the inhibition of mTOR has become a desirable therapeutic option
in the treatment of cancer.

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Inhibitors
Under Investigation in Cancer Treatment
Several mTOR inhibitors currently are under investigation for possible therapeutic use in the treatment of cancer, including sarcomas. These include sirolimus and its
analogs temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus.
Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is the prototype
mTOR inhibitor—it is a natural compound that initially
was approved as an immunosuppressant for organ transplantation but also is known for its antifungal and

anticancer activities.10,33,34 In cancer, sirolimus may alter
the composition and/or conformation of the multiprotein
mTOR complexes and allosterically block access of substrates to the mTOR kinase domain by binding to the kinase domain of mTOR.10 This causes an inhibition of cell
proliferation by arresting cells in the G1 phase and inducing apoptosis in selected models.10 However, initially, it
was speculated that the ability to use sirolimus at effective
doses as an anticancer agent would be hindered by reports
of poor aqueous solubility and chemical stability.5 In an
effort to improve on the natural sirolimus product, novel
analogs have been created.34 Temsirolimus, a prodrug of
sirolimus, is a selective binding inhibitor of mTOR that
acts on a variety of tumor cells, in particular those with a
PTEN deletion.35,36 Everolimus, an orally available
mTOR inhibitor with greater solubility than sirolimus,
was developed in an attempt to improve the pharmacokinetic characteristics of sirolimus, particularly to increase
oral bioavailability.37 Ridaforolimus is a nonprodrug analog of sirolimus with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including solubility, stability, and bioavailability.
Only temsirolimus (Torisel; Pfizer, New York, NY)
and everolimus (Afinitor; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ)
have Food and Drug Administration-approved indications in oncology for the treatment of advanced renal cell
carcinoma.38,39 Although sirolimus is currently not indicated for the treatment of cancer, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend its use
for the treatment of angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis as well as perivascular epithelioid cell
tumors.1 Ridaforolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus
are being investigated for use in sarcoma treatment.22,40
There are ongoing phase 2 trials for sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus; also, a phase 3 trial
for ridaforolimus as maintenance therapy in sarcoma has
completed enrollment.

coma, rhabdomyosarcoma), have demonstrated the
therapeutic potential of sirolimus in combination with cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide or vincristine.44
Temsirolimus (CCI-779)

In murine xenograft models of rhabdomyosarcoma
cell lines (Rh30 and RD), treatment with temsirolimus
was effective in inhibiting tumor growth.45 The antitumor activity of temsirolimus was associated with a reduction of HIF-1a levels and VEGF protein expression and
with decreased microvessel density in Rh30-derived and
RD-derived tumors, demonstrating suppressed tumor
growth through an antiangiogenic mechanism. Treatment
with a single 20-mg/kg dose of temsirolimus suppressed
the phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1, indicating the inhibition of mTOR activity. In another study that used a
rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 mouse xenograft model, a high
correlation coefficient was reported between decreases in
phosphorylation of threonine residue 70 (Thr70) of 4EBP1 and tumor growth inhibition with temsirolimus.35
These results suggest that decreases in Thr70 phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 may be a useful surrogate marker for
determining inhibition of mTOR activity in tumors.
Everolimus (RAD001)

Everolimus has demonstrated antiproliferative activity against several tumor cell lines and in a broad range of
human tumor xenografts.46-53 In a mouse model of
human GIST, everolimus inhibited translational response
and cell proliferation in tumor lesions.54 By virtue of its
ability to induce cell cycle arrest, these results suggest that
everolimus is potentially useful in the treatment of
patients with imatinib-resistant GIST. Treatment with
everolimus also decelerated tumor growth and prolonged
life span in a mouse model of leiomyosarcoma.55
Ridaforolimus (AP23573, MK-8669)

Preclinical Studies
Sirolimus

Sirolimus has demonstrated ability to inhibit the
growth of B16 melanoma, P388 leukemia, MiaPaCa-2
cells, and Panc-1 human pancreatic carcinoma in xenograft models.41,42 Results from the Pediatric Preclinical
Testing Program have indicated that sirolimus has broad
antitumor activity against in vivo panels of childhood
tumors, with noteworthy activity in select sarcoma and
acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts.43 In addition,
recent data from this program, which examined in vivo
solid tumor models, including sarcomas (Ewing, osteosar-

Studies of ridaforolimus in human xenograft models
of various tumor cell lines (prostate, breast, pancreas,
lung, and colon) have demonstrated potent inhibition of
tumor growth.56 Ridaforolimus also reduced the rate of
cell proliferation in vitro in a panel of 11 sarcoma and 6
endometrial cell lines and inhibited the rate of tumor
growth in a leiomyosarcoma xenograft model.57 In
another study, sarcoma and endometrial cancer cell lines
were treated in vitro with combinations of drugs that
included ridaforolimus to determine their antagonistic,
additive, or synergistic effects on cell growth.58 The combination of ridaforolimus and doxorubicin demonstrated

1489

Review Article

at least an additive inhibitory effect in 4 sarcoma cell lines.
The combination of ridaforolimus with doxorubicin, carboplatin, or paclitaxel as well as the triple combination of
carboplatin, paclitaxel, and ridaforolimus had additive
effects on 3 endometrial cell lines. Additive growth inhibition of all sarcoma and endometrial cancer cell lines also
was observed when ridaforolimus was combined with 2deoxyglucose, a metabolic inhibitor.
Phase 1 Studies
The design of phase 1 studies of mTOR inhibitors generally has followed that of phase 1 studies for cytotoxic
agents, including the determination of safety and tolerability and definition of the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD).

phase 1 study examining an oral formulation of temsirolimus in patients with advanced cancer (N ¼ 24) reported
an MTD of 75 mg once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks.
The most common treatment-related adverse events
(AEs) were mucositis, rash/maculopapular rash, and
asthenia.66
Other ongoing phase 1 trials are evaluating the combination of intravenous temsirolimus with sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid
tumors67; valproic acid in young patients with relapsed
neuroblastoma, bone sarcoma, or STS68; vinorelbine for
advanced solid tumors, including uterine sarcoma69; liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent sarcoma70;
and irinotecan for patients with refractory sarcomas.71
Everolimus

Sirolimus

In patients (N ¼ 21) with solid tumors (eg, sarcoma,
pancreatic, colorectal, hepatocellular, and neuroendocrine
tumors), the MTD of oral sirolimus was 6 mg daily.59 No
objective responses were observed, but 10 patients
achieved stable disease (SD). Results from that study indicated that drug exposure increased in proportion to dose
and that the pharmacokinetic profile of sirolimus was
comparable to that in transplantation studies. These
results suggest that, in contrast to previous reports, sirolimus is sufficiently absorbed and, thus, may be an effective
mTOR inhibitor for cancer therapy.59 Currently, phase 1
studies are evaluating oral sirolimus for the treatment of
patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related
Kaposi sarcoma60 and in combination with bevacizumab
for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.61 Finally, a
phase 1 study is assessing nanoparticle albumin-boundrapamycin (ABI-009) in patients with advanced solid
tumors, including sarcoma.62,63
Temsirolimus

In a phase 1 trial, intravenous temsirolimus was
administered to patients (N ¼ 63) with advanced cancer
(eg, solid tumors, including sarcomas or lymphomas).
The MTD was 15 mg/m2 daily for 5 days every 2 weeks
for patients who had received extensive previous anticancer treatment and 19 mg/m2 daily for 5 days every 2
weeks for minimally pretreated patients.64 In another
study, patients (N ¼ 24) who received a weekly intravenous temsirolimus dose (7.5-220 mg/m2) demonstrated
antitumor activity; confirmed partial responses (PRs)
were evident in 2 patients, and minor responses were
reported in 2 additional patients.65 Furthermore, another

1490

Two studies were conducted in patients with
advanced tumors (eg, colorectal, nonsmall cell lung, pancreas, and breast) who were unresponsive to standard therapy. In 1 trial, oral everolimus was tolerated by patients
(N ¼ 55) at a dose of 10 mg daily or 50 mg per week;
whereas, in the other trial, oral everolimus was tolerated
by patients (N ¼ 92) at doses up to 10 mg daily and 70
mg per week.72,73 The results demonstrated that everolimus is dose dependent and that continuous daily dosing
produced more profound mTOR inhibition than weekly
dosing. Those studies also demonstrated a clinical benefit
with oral everolimus: In 1 study, a clinical benefit was
observed in 4 patients; and, in the second study, PRs were
observed in 4 patients, and 12 patients remained progression-free for 6 months.72,73 Moreover, an ongoing
study is evaluating oral everolimus in combination with
vatalanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with
advanced solid tumors.74 In pediatric patients, a phase 1
trial has investigated oral everolimus for the treatment of
recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including STS,75
whereas other trials (phase 2) are planned to further evaluate treatment of advanced sarcoma.76,77
Ridaforolimus

Two phase 1 studies examined patients with solid
malignancies (eg, STS, renal cell carcinoma, nonsmall cell
lung carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder) using the intravenous formulation of ridaforolimus.78,79 In 1 trial, in patients (N ¼ 32) who received at
least 1 dose of ridaforolimus (3-28 mg daily), the MTD
for ridaforolimus was 18.75 mg intravenously once daily
for 5 consecutive days every 2 weeks.78 Among the
patients who were evaluated for tumor response, 22

achieved SD or a PR; all patients with sarcoma and renal
cell carcinoma experienced a PR, SD, or a minor response
that lasted for >3 months. In the other trial, in patients
(N ¼ 46) who received various doses of ridaforolimus
(6.25-225 mg daily), the MTD was 75 mg per week.79 Of
30 patients who were evaluable for response to daily ridaforolimus treatment, 22 achieved SD, and 7 had a best
overall response to disease progression. On the basis of
these results, the dose recommended for phase 2 trials was
12.5 mg intravenously once daily for 5 days every other
week.11
Oral regimens of ridaforolimus also have been
examined in patients (N ¼ 147) with advanced metastatic
solid tumors refractory to standard therapy.80 A ridaforolimus dose of 40 mg once daily for 5 days each week demonstrated antitumor activity consistent with the
intravenous formulation.80 Clinical benefit (defined as
SD for >16 weeks, a PR, or complete response [CR]) was
observed with all regimens in patients with several types of
sarcomas and a variety of carcinomas; 36 patients (24.5%)
achieved a clinical benefit, including 23 patients with sarcoma (15.6%). In the group that received ridaforolimus
40 mg once daily for 5 days each week (n ¼ 24), 3 of 13
patients (23%) with sarcomas achieved a clinical benefit,
and 2 of 13 patients (15.4%) achieved a PR. The 6-month
progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 29%, and the me-

regimens.80 The intravenous formulation of ridaforolimus also has been investigated in pediatric patients with
advanced solid tumors.81
Other phase 1 trials have examined intravenous ridaforolimus in combination with paclitaxel (a cytotoxic
agent) for the treatment of taxane-sensitive solid tumors82
and oral ridaforolimus in combination with bevacizumab
(a monoclonal antibody that blocks VEGF-A) for patients
with advanced cancers.83 Currently, oral ridaforolimus is
being studied in combination with standard chemotherapy for STS.84
Phase 2 Studies
Sirolimus

A phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label trial investigated the treatment of angiomyolipoma, a benign renal
neoplasm rich in fat, muscle, and blood vessels, with sirolimus in patients (N ¼ 25) with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Table 1).86 The results indicated
that oral sirolimus reduced the volume of renal angiomyolipomas, and tumors regressed during therapy but generally increased in volume after cessation of treatment. The
majority of patients experienced an AE, and 5 patients
experienced serious AEs (SAEs) while taking sirolimus. In
another phase 2 trial, oral sirolimus was evaluated in

1491

Review Article

patients with complicated vascular anomalies, including
Kaposi-form hemangioendotheliomas.90 Finally, an
ongoing phase 2 trial is examining oral sirolimus in combination with cyclophosphamide for the treatment of
advanced sarcoma.91
Temsirolimus

A multicenter, phase 2 study evaluated weekly intravenous temsirolimus in chemotherapy-naive patients
(N ¼ 41) with advanced metastatic STS but failed to
meet its clinical endpoints. Among 38 evaluable patients,
2 patients achieved a confirmed PR, including 1 patient
with fibrosarcoma and another patient with leiomyosarcoma (Table 1).86 The median time to progression was
estimated at 2 months (95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.5
months). Most patients experienced AEs, with 43% of
patients experiencing grade 3/4 events at least possibly
related to treatment. Although these results indicate that
treatment with temsirolimus alone does not seem to be a
promising therapy for patients with advanced STS, it is
important to note that the study endpoint was a confirmed tumor response to treatment, defined as a CR or
PR on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart.86
The exclusion of SD in the assessment of treatment outcome resulted in a lower treatment response rate compared with other trials in sarcoma that evaluated other
clinical endpoints, such as clinical benefit response, which
incorporates SD. Another phase 2 trial examined intravenous temsirolimus in 52 pediatric patients with recurrent/
refractory neuroblastoma, high-grade glioma, or rhabdomyosarcoma.92 Preliminary data from that trial indicated
that 2 patients (1 neuroblastoma, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma)
achieved a PR at 12 weeks and that 11 patients achieved
SD that lasted for 12 weeks.92 Although the trial failed
to meet its endpoint of tumor response (at least 2 patients
in a subgroup needed to experience objective responses
once 12 patients in that group had been enrolled), the
responses observed and the clinical benefit attained by
some patients suggest that further assessment may be
warranted.
Several ongoing phase 2 trials are evaluating the benefit of intravenous temsirolimus in patients with various
subtypes of sarcoma. Temsirolimus is being investigated
as a single agent in patients with STS or GIST93 as well as
patients with recurrent or persistent uterine cancer.94
Also, temsirolimus is being evaluated in combination
studies with vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide in
patients with recurrent or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma,95 and with selumetinib, a mitogen-activated pro-

1492

tein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, in patients with
metastatic, recurrent, or locally advanced unresectable
STS.93
Everolimus

The oral agent everolimus has been studied as a
combination therapy in a phase 2 trial in patients with
imatinib-resistant GIST. All patients received everolimus
(2.5 mg daily) and imatinib (600 mg daily) (Table 1).87
Patients were enrolled in 2 strata: those who progressed after first-line treatment with oral imatinib and those who
progressed after imatinib and other therapies (most
patients received oral sunitinib as second-line treatment).
Of the 28 patients in the study who failed prior treatment
with imatinib, 23 were evaluable, and 4 of those patients
(17.4%) were progression-free at 4 months. In addition,
47 patients enrolled in the trial had failed treatment with
first-line imatinib and second-line sunitinib; among the
35 patients who were evaluable, 13 (37.1%) were progression-free at 4 months. Most patients reported AEs: Sixtyseven percent experienced grade 3 or 4 AEs, and 48%
experienced SAEs. These results suggest that patients with
GIST may benefit from combined treatment in case of
first-line and second-line treatment failure. In another
phase 2 study, everolimus was studied in patients with
STS or bone sarcoma, but limited clinical efficacy was
observed (CR/PR or SD rate, 20%). The most common
AEs were skin toxicity, mucositis, and fatigue; serious AEs
included pneumonitis and anemia.96
Everolimus is being investigated in 2 other phase 2
trials: 1) a multicenter, triple-arm trial investigating everolimus monotherapy in patients with progressive or metastatic STS or bone sarcoma and in patients with GIST
who failed treatment with first-line oral imatinib or second-line oral sunitinib97; and 2) a single-arm, open-label
monotherapy trial in patients with resectable STS of the
extremities or the retroperitoneum.98 An ongoing phase
2/3 trial is further evaluating the benefit of combined
treatment with everolimus and oral imatinib in patients
with progressive GIST.99
Ridaforolimus

In a phase 2, open-label, nonrandomized trial,
patients with advanced sarcomas (N ¼ 212) received a
12.5-mg intravenous dose of ridaforolimus administered
daily for 5 days every 2 weeks (Table 1).89 The overall rate

histiocytoma) and 3 patients who had an unconfirmed PR
(1 osteosarcoma, 1 small round cell desmoplastic sarcoma,
and 1 unclassifiable STS). The median overall survival
(OS) was 40 weeks. The use of clinical benefit response to
assess treatment outcome produced a higher treatment
response rate compared with the temsirolimus trial
described above, which used the confirmed objective
response rate. Appropriate clinical trial endpoints to evaluate treatment outcomes in sarcoma have not been fully
established and are a current topic of debate. All patients
reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE, and 21 SAEs
were reported as at least possibly related to treatment in
20 patients. An ongoing phase 2 study is designed to assess
the benefit of oral ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic bone or STS.100
Phase 3 Studies
On the basis of results from the phase 1 oral study in metastatic solid tumors and the phase 2 intravenous study in
sarcoma, an oral formulation of ridaforolimus at a dose of
40 mg once daily 5 times per week was selected for testing
in a large phase 3 study in patients with sarcoma. The Sarcoma Multicenter Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy of
Ridaforolimus (SUCCEED) trial was designed to determine whether oral ridaforolimus can be used to maintain
disease stability in the metastatic setting.101 The multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized, phase 3 trial was planned to evaluate 650
patients with metastatic sarcoma who have had favorable
outcomes (eg, SD, PR, or CR) to first-line, second-line,
or third-line chemotherapy. The primary outcome measure is PFS; secondary efficacy endpoints include OS, best
target lesion response, improvement in symptoms, and
safety and tolerability (Fig. 2).101 Top-line data recently
presented from the SUCCEED trial demonstrate that
treatment with oral ridaforolimus resulted in a 28%
reduction (P ¼ .0001) in the risk of progression compared
with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.72) and a statistically significant 21% (3.1 week) improvement in median PFS (ridaforolimus vs placebo, 17.7 weeks vs 14.6 weeks).89 In a
preliminary analysis based on 313 events, the median OS
with ridaforolimus was 88.0 weeks versus 78.7 weeks in
the placebo group. The incidence of stomatitis (52%) and
other AEs was higher with ridaforolimus than with placebo; these findings were consistent with safety data
reported for other mTOR inhibitors. Although additional
data on secondary endpoints are pending, including
updated OS data, these initial results for using ridaforolimus in the treatment of STS seem promising.

Safety and Tolerability in Phase 2 and 3 Trials
Table 2 summarizes safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies
of the mTOR inhibitors in patients with advanced metastatic sarcomas (temsirolimus, ridaforolimus), imatinibresistant GIST (everolimus in combination with imatinib), or angiomyolipomas (sirolimus).85-89 The most
common AEs reported for at least 2 mTOR inhibitors
include mouth ulcers (characterized as apthous ulcers,
mucositis, or stomatitis), diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, and
nausea. Mucositis/stomatitis is the most common doselimiting toxicity of these agents; the inflammation of the
oral mucosa associated with mTOR inhibitors is distinct
from conventional mucositis and appears to have a different underlying mechanism.102 In addition to oral-related
side effects, other mTOR class-specific AEs of clinical
relevance include metabolic/laboratory abnormalities—
such as hyperlipidemia and hypokalemia—skin disorders,
and pneumonitis.85,89 Severe or grade 3/4 AEs reported
across multiple studies with mTOR inhibitors include
stomatitis, vomiting, fatigue, anemia, and hypokalemia.

Future Prospects
Recent in vitro evidence has indicated that pretreating sarcoma cells with an IGF-1R antibody blocks rapamycininduced feedback activation of Akt, thereby leading to
enhanced cytotoxicity.11 On the basis of this evidence, a
phase 1 study using a combination of oral everolimus and
intravenous figitumumab, an antibody to IGF-1R, in
patients with advanced sarcomas demonstrated that 83%
of patients who were evaluable for a response achieved
SD.103 Similarly, another phase 1 study currently is evaluating oral ridaforolimus in combination with intravenous
dalotuzumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody
that also blocks IGF-1R, in patients with advanced solid
tumors.104 Intravenous temsirolimus also is being studied
in a phase 2 trial in combination with intravenous cixutumumab, another monoclonal antibody to IGF-1R, for the
treatment of sarcomas, including recurrent STS or bone
sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.105,106 Several orally available, novel ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors currently
are in phase 1 and 2 trials, including NVP-BEZ235
(Novartis), a dual PI3K/mTOR modulator that blocks
the dysfunctional activation of the PI3K pathway and
induces G1 arrest,107 and the PI3K inhibitors XL765
(Exelixis) and XL147.5 Although the benefit observed
with current mTOR inhibitors seems to be primarily in
maintaining SD, the second generation of mTOR inhibitors currently being developed may have the potential to
produce higher objective tumor response rates.
In conclusion, currently, a very limited number of
treatment options exist for sarcomas. Mammalian target
of rapamycin, a serine/threonine kinase, has a pivotal role
in controlling cell growth, metabolism, cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and cell survival. Dysregulation of mTORassociated signaling pathways has been observed in several

1494

malignancies, including sarcomas. Consequently, the
mTOR pathway is considered an important target for
anticancer drug development. Clinical studies of mTOR
inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging results across a
broad range of tumor types and present promising treatment options, particularly for patients with advanced sarcoma, whose tumors are challenging to treat. Classspecific AEs observed with mTOR inhibitors include
mild-to-moderate mouth ulcers (described as either stomatitis, mucositis, or aphthouse-like), skin rash/erythema,
and some metabolic abnormalities. The mTOR inhibitors
currently under clinical investigation for use in the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic sarcoma
include sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus, all of which have demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile and antitumor activity in a variety of sarcoma
subtypes.
