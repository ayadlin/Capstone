ABSTRACT
We aimed to identify clinical predictors of long-term response to abiraterone
(defined as >12 months drug exposure) in a retrospective cohort of metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated in post-docetaxel setting at 24
Italian centers. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the association

between clinical features and the duration of drug exposure. Results were expressed
as hazard ratios (HR) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 143
patients met the inclusion criteria. Their median age was 73 years, median Gleason
score 8 and median abiraterone exposure 20 months. At the univariate analysis, a
significant correlation with the duration of abiraterone exposure was found for Gleason
score (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.96; p=0.012), PSA (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18; p=0.08)
and lactic dehydrogenase levels (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.46; p=0.027), while the
association between lower alkaline phosphatase levels and treatment duration was
marginally significant (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.16; p=0.074). Only PSA and Gleason
score were predictive of long-term treatment duration in the multivariate analysis. No
other clinical factors resulted to be predictive of sustained response to abiraterone,
including metastatic disease at diagnosis and visceral disease, suggesting that all
subgroups of patients may derive a substantial clinical benefit from abiraterone
treatment. These findings need to be validated in prospective, larger studies.

score was 8 (range 3-10). The majority of patients (89%)
had bone metastases only, and 28% had synchronous
metastases at diagnosis. Median serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels before starting abiraterone
were 38 ng/dL (range 0.45-1339 ng/dL), 98.5 U/L
(range 36-1778 U/L) and 269.5 U/L (range 113-1119
U/L), respectively. Patients received a median of 3 prior
lines (interquartile range [IQR] 2-4) of therapy before
starting abiraterone, including chemotherapy (86%).
The main reasons for treatment failure before starting
abiraterone included PSA progression (33%), both PSA
andradiological progression (55%) and radiological
progression only (12%).
Median follow-up was 34.6 months and median
duration of abiraterone treatment was 19.8 months (IQR
14.3-29.4 months) (Figure 1). At the time of analysis, 34
(24%) patients were still receiving abiraterone. In the
remaining patients (72%) treatment was discontinued
due to disease progression, while 31 (23%) had died. The
treatment was well tolerated. The only adverse events
which were reported were grade 1 (G1) hypokalemia
(5%), G1-G2 asthenia (17%; G1, 14% and G2, 3%), G2
anemia (5%), G1 mucositis (5%) and G1 diarrhea (3%).
No G3-G4 adverse events were reported.
PSA response ≥50% was observed in 80% of
patients (n=114), with a disease control rate of 88%
(n=126).
Three predictors were significantly associated with
the duration of abiraterone treatment: Gleason score
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.96, p=0.012),
PSA (the relative hazard function was time varying as
reported in Table 2, p=0.001; unit=100 ng/dL) and LDH
(HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.46, p=0.027; unit=100 U/L). The
association between ALP and abiraterone exposure did not
quite reach statistical significance (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.991.16; p=0.074; unit=100 U/L). While increasing levels of
circulating tumor biomarkers (PSA, ALP and LDH) were
associated with increased risk of abiraterone interruption,
a high Gleason score was found to predict decreased risk
of progression. No statistically significant association with

INTRODUCTION
Treatment options for metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC) have expanded considerably over
the last few years, but how to select the most appropriate
drug for each patient in order to obtain maximum benefit
from the available therapies still remains unclear. Although
recent studies have shown that molecular biomarkers such
as androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) or ERG gene
status hold promise as potential predictors of response [1–3],
at present there are no validated predictive biomarkers able
to inform clinicians on best treatment selection for mCRPC
patients [4]. Therefore, in clinical practice treatment
strategies are decided empirically by taking into account
mainly patient- and disease-related characteristics, as well
as the risk-benefit ratio and the safety profile of the available
drugs. AR axis-targeted therapies have become the mainstay
of treatment in metastatic CRPC, both in chemotherapynaïve patients and in those progressing after docetaxel.
Abiraterone, a selective inhibitor of CYP17, was the first
available drug in this class and has been widely used in
Europe since its approval in 2011. In the registration trial
COU-AA-301, treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone
significantly increased median overall survival compared
with placebo (15.8 vs 11.2 months, HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.640.86; p<0.0001) in mCRPC patients previously treated with
docetaxel, with a median duration of abiraterone exposure
of 7.4 months [5].
In this study we retrospectively analyzed clinical
records of men with mCRPC who had received abiraterone
post-docetaxel in routine clinical settings in Italy, with the
aim to identify potential clinical predictors of long-term
response to abiraterone, by defining long-term responders
as those patients receiving this drug for >12 months.

RESULTS
We identified 143 patients who met the inclusion
criteria and were evaluated. Demographic and clinical
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Median age
was 73 years (range 47-87 years) and median Gleason

observed also in patients with unfavorable prognostic
features such as high Gleason score, synchronous
metastases at diagnosis or visceral disease.
A feature that sets our study apart from other similar
investigations is the fact that we looked for potential
clinical predictors of long-term response to abiraterone
by focusing on a cohort of patients with a duration of
drug exposure longer than expected (as compared with
published data), rather than searching for factors that
might help discriminate between responders and non/poor
responders. The cut-off point of 12 months for definition
of long-term response was arbitrarily selected based on
the median abiraterone exposure of 7.4 months (range 0.225.6) reported in the pivotal abiraterone COU-AA-301
study in chemotherapy-treated patients [5].
A significant association with the duration of
drug exposure was found for Gleason score, PSA and

DISCUSSION
The most significant finding of this study is the
considerable proportion of heavily pre-treated mCRPC
patients who achieved, in a routine oncology practice
setting, a relevant clinical benefit with abiraterone.
The duration of response exceeded, in many cases, two
years (median 20 months). This long-term response was

LDH levels before starting treatment, with a marginally
significant association for ALP. The correlation between
rising levels of circulating tumor biomarkers and poorer
response were not surprising, given that PSA, LDH and
ALP are known prognostic factors for survival in CRPC
across a wide range of therapies, or in the absence of
life-prolonging treatments [6–9]. Unexpectedly, a higher
Gleason score was found to correlate to longer drug
exposure. This association, however, has been documented
in other studies, where high Gleason score was found to
be predictive of sustained treatment response in docetaxel
trials [10, 11] but not in the “new hormonal compounds”
trials. In a recent retrospective analysis of the COUAA-301 and COU-AA-302 trials by Fizazi et al [12],
initial Gleason score was not predictive of response to
abiraterone in either chemotherapy naïve or post-docetaxel
patients, as no significant difference in treatment benefits
was found between patients with a Gleason score of < 8
versus ≥ 8.
No other potential predictors of long-term
response emerged from our analysis. In particular, the
presence of synchronous metastases at diagnosis and
visceral disease were not associated with a less favorable
outcome (although only 8.4% of patients had visceral
metastases in our cohort). The lack of a significant
association between presence of visceral metastases
and radiological progression or survival has been
observed in other recent retrospective studies in patients
treated with AR-targeted therapies [13, 14]. These
findings are in keeping with the results of subgroup

and exploratory post-hoc analyses of the COU-AA-301
trial and suggest that all subgroups of patients are likely
to derive at least some clinical benefit (not excluding
the possibility of a long-term benefit) from abiraterone
treatment, irrespective of unfavorable baseline clinical
characteristics [5, 15]. Furthermore, most of our patients
had skeletal metastases only, and they might well
represent ideal candidates for abiraterone treatment,
as suggested by recent data documenting direct bone
anabolic and anti-resorptive effects of this drug both in
vitro and in CRPC patients [16].
Our study had limitations that need to be taken
into account when interpreting the results, including
the retrospective design and the relatively small
patient population. The lack of a control group of
early refractory patients did not allow to discriminate
between early refractory and long responding patients.
Moreover, we evaluated outcome based on abiraterone
exposure time rather than using standardized outcome
measures such as overall survival (OS) or progressionfree survival (PFS).
Several biomarkers have been recently proposed
as potential predictors of treatment response in
mCRPC, including tumor-associated genetic profiling
parameters from biopsies, circulating biomarkers,
imaging data and clinical variables. AR-V7 has been
linked to primary resistance to either abiraterone
or enzalutamide, and monitoring AR-V7 status in
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) over the course of
treatment may predict sensitivity or resistance to AR-

targeted agents [1, 2]. Analysis of AR-modulated ERG
expression in archival tumor biopsies from patients
enrolled in the COU-AA-302 trial showed that ERG
gene fusion expression (2+ Edel cancers), previously
considered as unfavorable prognostic factor for
survival, was associated with the greatest clinical
benefit from abiraterone treatment [17]. Imaging
biomarkers may also assist in therapeutic monitoring
and outcome prediction, as suggested by the results of
a pilot study on the use of 18-F fluorocholine positron
emission tomography/computed tomography (FCHPET/CT) in early evaluation of abiraterone response
in the post-docetaxel setting [18]. Nevertheless, the
lack of standardization, the limited availability and
the cost of the newer imaging modalities are still
an issue. Among circulating biomarkers, CTCs and
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR, a manifestation of
tumor-promoting inflammation) have been shown to
be prognostic in many cancer types and are receiving
much attention in the context of mCRPC [6, 19]. A
biomarker panel based on CTCs count and LDH was
shown to meet the Prentice criteria as a surrogate for
OS in the COU-AA-301 trial, and validation studies
are ongoing [20]. On the other hand, preliminary data
suggest that a 30% decline in CTCs levels 4 weeks
after treatment initiation from baseline may predict
treatment response to abiraterone or chemotherapy
in patients with mCRPC [21]. In a cohort of mCRPC

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients treated with abiraterone in a Canadian study
(53% post-docetaxel), Leibowitz-Amit et al. identified
a composite score derived from the sum of baseline
NLR and the extent of metastatic spread as a predictor
of PSA response [22]. Preliminary data have also shown
that an increase in NLR persisting during enzalutamide
treatment in chemotherapy-treated mCRPC patients
may predict a poor response to enzalutamide [23].
Retrospective analysis of the Temporary
Authorization for Use programme in France showed that
PSA decrease at 3 months was a predictive factor for
abiraterone treatment duration [24]. In our experience
we could not explore this correlation because of
different timepoints for PSA evaluation. Among clinical
biomarkers, the duration of previous androgen-deprivation
therapy (ADT) response, or time to CRPC, has received
much attention as a potential predictor of response to the
new AR-targeted therapies. In a retrospective study in 61
mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone post-docetaxel,
Ashfar et al. identified three independent predictors of
OS: hemoglobin levels, ECOG-PS at starting abiraterone,
and duration of response to primary androgen-deprivation
therapy [13]. Similarly, time to CRPC ≥12 months and
ECOG-PS score 0-1 were associated with improved PFS
in a cohort of 173 patients treated with enzalutamide,
abiraterone or other hormonal therapies at two French
cancer centers [14]. The duration of previous hormonal
therapy resulted to be associated with better OS also in the

abiraterone-treated cohort (n=306) of the aforementioned
Temporary Authorization for Use study [24]. Furthermore,
time to development of CRPC was identified as the
strongest predictor of PSA response, PSA-PFS and OS
also when AR-targeted therapies were used in a second
line setting, as reported in a retrospective study evaluating
the outcome of 126 patients treated with sequential
abiraterone and enzalutamide [25]. Other studies, however,
failed to identify a significant association between duration
of previous androgen-deprivation therapy and response to
subsequent AR-targeted treatments (including the cited
investigation by Leibowitz-Amit et al.) [22]. In our study,
data about the duration of previous hormonal treatment
were not always available for analysis and therefore we
could not explore this factor.
It should be emphasized that none of the biomarkers
so far investigated have yet been validated as predictors of
treatment response [4, 6].
In conclusion, our retrospective analysis in patient
with mCRPC, mostly treated in post-docetaxel setting,
showed that high Gleason score, lower PSA and LDH
levels before starting abiraterone were significantly
associated with long-term abiraterone exposure (a
marginal significance being found for lower ALP). We
failed to identify more specific clinical factors predictive
of sustained response to this drug, suggesting that all
suitable patients may receive abiraterone therapy on
the basis of clinical or tumor-related characteristics.
Prospective studies in larger patient populations are
needed to confirm our findings.

(PSA progression only or radiological progression),
M-staging at diagnosis, sites of metastases, PSA response
rates and objective response (in men with measurable
disease). The study endpoint was the time from the start
of abiraterone treatment to abiraterone interruption from
any cause. Patients’ data were collected for retrospective
analysis in April 2015.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize
demographic and clinical features (median, IQR
and range for continuous variables, absolute and
percentage frequencies for categorical variables). The
Cox proportional hazards model was used to detect
and estimate the statistical association between the
patients’ demographic-clinical features and the duration
of abiraterone exposure; the hazard ratio (HR) was used
as population parameter and the Wald test statistic was
used to test H0: HR = 0. All statistical tests were twosided and statistical significance was detected at the
5% probability level (p-value<0.05). For each predictor
the assumption of proportional hazard was tested using
a Cox’s model with a constant and linear term in time.
For each continuous predictor associated to abiraterone
treatment duration the best thresholds were identified
using the CART methodology [26], with regression trees
being generated by means of the Recursive Partitioning
and Regression Trees (Rpart) package. Each tree was
pruned back in order to avoid data overfitting and the tree
size that minimized the cross-validated error was chosen.
At least one threshold was mandatory. A backward
elimination Cox regression procedure at 0.05 level was
used to identify the strongest predictors of abiraterone
treatment duration.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
survival functions. The inverse Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate median follow-up; patients still
receiving abiraterone at the time of the last contact were
right censored.
Apart from CART methodology, the statistical
analysis was performed using the SAS software (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA), version 9.2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with histologically confirmed mCRPC who
were treated with abiraterone for >12 months at 24 Italian
cancer centers from October 2011 to July 2014 were
retrospectively identified. Clinical records were collected
and the following demographic and clinical parameters
were analyzed: age at initial abiraterone exposure, duration
of abiraterone treatment, number and type of previous
anticancer therapies, serum levels of PSA, ALP and LDH
before starting abiraterone, Gleason score at diagnosis,
type of disease progression before starting abiraterone
