Acute and Late Onset Cognitive Dysfunction
Associated With Chemotherapy in Women
With Breast Cancer
Jeffrey S. Wefel, PhD1; Angele K. Saleeba, PhD1; Aman U. Buzdar, MD2; and Christina A. Meyers, PhD1

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports cognitive dysfunction associated with standard dose chemotherapy in
breast cancer survivors. We determined the incidence, nature, and chronicity of cognitive dysfunction in a prospective longitudinal randomized phase 3 treatment trial for patients with T1-3, N0-1, M0 breast cancer receiving 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with or without paclitaxel. METHODS: Forty-two patients underwent a
neuropsychological evaluation including measures of cognition, mood, and quality of life. Patients were scheduled to
be assessed before chemotherapy, during and shortly after chemotherapy, and 1 year after completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Before chemotherapy, 21% (9 of 42) evidenced cognitive dysfunction. In the acute interval, 65% (24 of
37) demonstrated cognitive decline. At the long-term evaluation, 61% (17 of 28) evidenced cognitive decline after cessation of treatment. Within this group of patients, 71% (12 of 17) evidenced continuous decline from the acute interval,
and, notably, 29% (5 of 17) evidenced new delayed cognitive decline. Cognitive decline was most common in the
domains of learning and memory, executive function, and processing speed. Cognitive decline was not associated
with mood or other measured clinical or demographic characteristics, but late decline may be associated with baseline level of performance. CONCLUSIONS: Standard dose systemic chemotherapy is associated with decline in cognitive function during and shortly after completion of chemotherapy. In addition, delayed cognitive dysfunction
occurred in a large proportion of patients. These findings are consistent with a developing body of translational animal research demonstrating both acute and delayed structural brain changes as well as functional changes associC 2010 American

Reduced recurrence and improved survival has been reported for women with primary breast cancer who receive sys-

temic chemotherapy.1 However, breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are known to be at risk for adverse side
effects such as bone marrow suppression, nausea, and cardiotoxicity.2 The incidence of neurotoxicity is less well known
and the traditional definition of neurotoxicity does not address the full range of central nervous system sequelae associated
with chemotherapy.
‘‘Neurotoxicity’’ is often defined as peripheral neuropathy or encephalopathy.3 Unfortunately, the neuropsychological manifestations of neurotoxicity such as memory loss are not as well described in the literature. 5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC), with or without paclitaxel, is a commonly used regimen for the treatment of breast
cancer. FAC has been associated with neutropenia, secondary leukemia, and transient encephalopathy.4-7 Although little
is known regarding the neuropsychological effects of this regimen, more is known about the individual agents. Acute and
delayed neurotoxic reactions including encephalopathy characterized by confusion, disorientation, and higher order cognitive deficits have been associated with 5-fluorouracil.8,9 Paclitaxel stabilizes the polymerized form of microtubules,
which leads to large numbers of microtubules aggregated in unusual arrays and degeneration of the nerve axon.10,11
Although this axonopathy is well described for peripheral nerve injury, central nervous system axons are also at risk and
acute encephalopathy after paclitaxel has been described.12-14

Breast cancer survivors are concerned about the possible cognitive sequelae (coined ‘‘chemobrain’’) associated
with chemotherapies. Women with breast cancer represent a growing group of cancer survivors who frequently
want to return to their occupational, scholastic, or familial
activities, which rely heavily on the integrity of their cognitive functioning, highlighting the need to clearly understand the impact of chemotherapy on the brain.
Longitudinal prospective trials incorporating assessment of cognitive function have generally reported
between 20% and 61% of women with breast cancer demonstrate alterations in cognitive function after receiving
standard dose chemotherapy.15-22 Methodologically, the
inclusion of a pretreatment baseline is critical as several
studies have demonstrated that up to a third of women
evidence cognitive dysfunction before administration of
systemic chemotherapeutic agents.17,18,20,23,24
The following study reports the results of a prospective randomized longitudinal trial that included examination of the incidence, nature, and chronicity of cognitive
dysfunction in breast cancer patients treated with standard
dose adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients received an evaluation of their cognitive function, affective status, and quality of life (QOL) before treatment, during, and shortly
after treatment, and again at a late follow-up point after
treatment to monitor for any persistent or delayed cognitive sequelae.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients were recruited in conjunction with a randomized
phase 3 trial approved by the Institutional Review Board
of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.25 Patients with histologically confirmed invasive but
noninflammatory carcinoma of the breast were eligible.
All patients who met initial screening criteria and conCancer

sented to participate in the trial were consecutively registered into the protocol for evaluation. All patients had no
evidence of metastatic disease, were at least 18 years old,
completed 8 or more years of formal education, and were
fluent English speakers. No patient had a prior history of
other primary cancer, previous exposure to chemotherapy,
prior or current neurologic or psychiatric disorders, or
used substances active in the central nervous system that
were thought to affect cognition (eg, narcotics, steroids)
within 3 weeks before testing.
Patients were evaluated with a battery of standardized cognitive tests, mood measures, and a QOL questionnaire (Table 1) according to the study schema
depicted in Figure 1. Cognitive testing was conducted at
baseline and then on average 2.9 months (standard deviation ‘‘SD’’ ¼ 0.59), 7.0 months (SD, 1.4), and 13.1
months (SD ¼ 2.8) after baseline. Neuropsychological
tests were selected based on their sensitivity and suitability

for a brief assessment that could be repeated with minimal
practice effects and patient fatigue. Alternate forms were
used to minimize practice effects when possible.
Eighty-five patients met screening criteria for participation. Forty-three patients were not enrolled in the trial
for the following reasons: unable to contact (n ¼ 21),
time constraints (n ¼ 10), travel limitations (n ¼ 4), previous psychiatric illness (n ¼ 4), non-English speaker (n
¼ 3), and <8 years education (n ¼ 2). Forty-two patients
were contacted, consented, and underwent neuropsychological evaluation before beginning systemic therapy.

Statistical Analysis
Published normative data that adjusts for age, education,
and gender where appropriate were used to convert
patients’ raw cognitive test scores to standardized scores (z
scores; mean, 0; SD, 1) to facilitate comparisons among
measures. Each patient’s baseline cognitive function was
operationally defined as impaired (OCFI-I) or not
impaired (OCFI-NI) using a 2-part criterion that has
been previously described.23 By using curves based on the
binomial probability distribution,26 it was determined
that in a battery of 6 independent tests, approximately
12% of the population would perform 2 SDs below the
mean on a single measure and 5% of the population
would perform 1.5 SDs below the mean on 2 measures.
Thus, if the incidence of OCFI-I was equal to or greater
than the more conservative estimate of 12%, then it was
considered significant.
Longitudinal data analysis was performed using a
practice effect adjusted27 Reliable Change Index (RCI).28
Because the inherent error in test scores is known for tests
with published test-retest reliability, a change in score that
is clinically, as well as statistically meaningful, can be
determined. The RCI was used to determine the frequency of change in cognitive function between each
assessment (i.e., Baseline to Acute and Acute to Late). The
published study from which the RCI was determined is
listed for each test in Table 1.
Spearman’s rho correlations were performed
between mood and standardized cognitive measures at
each time point. Independent sample t tests and chisquare analyses were conducted to determine whether
there were differences between impaired and nonimpaired
patients at baseline on measures of QOL, mood, demographic, or clinical characteristics. Similar analyses,
including baseline cognitive impairment status, were conducted to examine differences between patients classified
as evidencing acute and late cognitive decline and those
classified as nondecliners. All analyses used an alpha level
of P.01 to establish statistical significance.

RESULTS
Baseline Interval
At baseline, 21% (n ¼ 9/42) were classified as OCFI-I (3
patients were impaired on a single test and 6 patients were
impaired on 2 or more tests). On average, OCFI-I
patients exhibited impairment on 2.1 tests, while OCFINI patients were impaired on 0.1 measures, which was
significantly different (t [40] ¼ 9.97; P<.0001). Measures

of psychomotor processing speed and executive function
showed impairment that exceeded the a priori defined
expected rates; whereas a measure of learning and memory
approached significance (Fig. 2). The Trail Making Test
(TMT) and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)
Total Recall identified 100% (9 of 9) of patients classified
as OCFI-I at baseline.
Self-report of depressive (Beck Depression Inventory ‘‘BDI’’) or anxious (State Trait Anxiety Inventory
‘‘STAIS’’) symptomatology were not significantly correlated with any cognitive test at baseline. There were no
significant differences between OCFI-I and OCFI-NI
patients in self-reported QOL at baseline. OCFI-I
patients were older than OCFI-NI patients (t [40] ¼ 3.31;
P<.005; mean in years SD, 55.9  7.5 and 46.8  7.2,
respectively). OCFI-I patients did not differ from OCFINI patients in education, menopausal status, hormone
replacement therapy history, or tumor stage (stage I and
IIA tumors were grouped and compared with stage IIB
and IIIA or IIIB tumors). Patients (29) who underwent
surgery before the baseline evaluation were no more likely
to be classified as OCFI-I than those who had not under-

gone surgery. The number of days between surgery and
the first testing was not significantly different between
OCFI-I and OCFI-NI patients. The proportion of
patients that completed each therapy at each time point is
listed in Table 3.
Acute Interval
Differences in cognitive function between patients
randomized to the FAC-only study arm versus
paclitaxel þ FAC study arm could not be evaluated as
only 8 subjects were randomized to the FAC-only study
arm and underwent neuropsychological evaluation.
Because of the small sample size, patients in both arms of
the study were combined for longitudinal analysis of cognitive functioning. Three patients never returned for follow-up evaluation for the following reasons: unable to
reschedule (2) and treated in another state (1). Two
patients were evaluated at baseline and at the long-term
postchemotherapy time point (both received therapy out
of the state or country). Thus, 37 patients were seen at
least once during or shortly after chemotherapy and were
available for longitudinal analysis. For patients evaluated
at both time points in the acute interval, if either of the
evaluations met criteria for decline, then they were considered to have declined. In these cases, the evaluation with
evidence of decline was used to examine changes from the
acute to late time point.
Approximately 65% (24 of 37) demonstrated an
acute decline in cognitive function during or shortly after
completion of chemotherapy (mean months since completion of chemotherapy, 1.6; SD, 1.2). For patients who
declined on treatment, none subsequently improved at
the evaluation shortly after chemotherapy. Thirty-eight
percent (9 of 14) declined on 1 measure, 58% (14 of 24)
declined on 2 measures, and 4% (1 of 24) declined on 3
measures. Figure 3 shows the frequency of acute changes
for each cognitive test. The HVLT and TMT identified

evidence late cognitive decline relative to their acute interval testing. Of these, 73% (8 of 11) declined in the acute
interval and were largely stable with no evidence of significant improvement (with the exception of 2 patients who
demonstrated improvement on the memory test alone);
whereas 27% (3 of 11) did not decline at any time point.
The vast majority (94%) of patients (16 of 17) exhibiting
late decline did so on 1 test. Improvement was rare in the
late interval; the TMT and HVLT again identified 94%
of patients with late decline. Figure 4 shows the pattern of
late emerging changes on each cognitive test.
There was a trend for those who declined at the late
evaluation to have been impaired at baseline. There was
no association with late decline and demographic/clinical
characteristics. Only 18% (3 of 17) of patients who evidenced late decline were on hormonal therapy (ie, tamoxifen) at the time of the evaluation, and no nondecliners
were on hormonal therapy. Similarly, only 18% (3 of 17)
patients who evidenced late decline were randomized to
the FAC-only study arm compared with 9% (1 of 11)
nondecliners. There was no significant difference between
late decliners and nondecliners in self-reported ability to
work. Table 4 provides a summary of the mean standardized test performance at each time point.

Late Interval
Approximately 13 months after the baseline evaluation
and 7.7 months (SD, 3.1) after completion of chemotherapy, 76% (28 of 37) patients who were evaluated during
or shortly after completion of chemotherapy underwent a
late post-treatment evaluation. Four patients who evidenced acute cognitive decline did not return for a late
evaluation for the following reasons: no show (2), treatment discontinued because of side effects including cognitive dysfunction (1), and development of metastatic
disease (1). Five patients who did not acutely decline were
not evaluated post-treatment for the following reasons: no
show (3), treatment discontinued because of side effects
including cognitive dysfunction (1) and development of
recurrent breast cancer (1). Approximately 61% (17 of
28) of patients who returned for the late evaluation demonstrated cognitive decline relative to their test performance during the acute interval. Of these patients, 71% (12
of 17) demonstrated both acute and late cognitive decline
(ie, continued decline), whereas 29% (5 of 17) demonstrated new onset cognitive decline that was not present in
the acute interval. Approximately 39% (11 of 28) did not

OCFI-NI patients on any other clinical, mood, or demographic variable. The domains most commonly affected
included learning and memory, executive function, and
processing speed. The incidence of OCFI-I is very similar
to that reported in several other studies that assessed pretreatment cognitive function.17,20,23 This finding underscores the importance of designing studies with a
pretreatment baseline evaluation. Cross-sectional studies
assessing the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction posttreatment are prone to an unacceptably high error rate.15
Acute decline in cognitive function during and/or
shortly after chemotherapy occurred in 65% of patients.
The most common domains affected included learning
and memory, executive function, and processing speed.
The incidence and pattern of acute decline is consistent
with our previous longitudinal trial.15 There were no differences between patients with acute decline versus those
that did not decline on any clinical, mood, or demographic variable. Baseline impairment status was not a risk
factor for acute decline.
Late cognitive decline occurred in 61% of patients,
with approximately 30% of these patients demonstrating
new onset, delayed cognitive dysfunction that was not
present earlier. Learning and memory declined most frequently at the late evaluation, with less frequent declines
in executive function and processing speed. There were no
differences between patients evidencing late decline versus
those that did not decline on any clinical, mood, or demographic variable. However, there was an intriguing trend
for baseline impairment status to be related to late decline.
All patients (7 of 7) who were classified as impaired at
baseline were subsequently classified as demonstrating late
decline; whereas only 48% (10 of 21) of patients nonimpaired at baseline were subsequently classified as demonstrating late decline. This suggests that pretreatment

Cancer

cognitive impairment may be related to increased risk for
cognitive dysfunction that does not recover or emerges in
the late postchemotherapy epoch. It is possible that baseline impairment reflects diminished brain/cognitive
reserve.57 The effect of this diathesis may not become differentially evident during and shortly after chemotherapy
when the adverse effects of these therapies may potentially
be overshadowed by stronger acute biological alterations
(eg, encephalopathy, anemia, neutropenia, proinflammatory cytokine cascades).4-14 However, in the postchemotherapy period, the impact of diminished brain/cognitive
reserve may play a greater role in the vulnerability of the
failure to fully recover from acute treatment related
changes in cognition and/or development of late cognitive
decline. Given the marginal significance of this finding in
a small sample, this will clearly need to be replicated in
future studies.
The improvements on a measure of auditory attention (Digit Span) and graphomotor speed (Digit Symbol)
that were evident at the acute evaluation tended to dissipate at the late evaluation. The significance of these findings is unclear. Notably, despite improvements in
attention, learning and memory performance declined
suggesting that these cognitive processes may be differentially affected. In addition, other measures requiring
graphomotor processing speed (TMTA and TMTB)
showed a consistent pattern of decline in both the acute
and late period.
Acute decline has been reported by several investigators that have longitudinally studied women with breast
cancer that received a fluorouracil-containing treatment
regimen.16-18,22,54,55 The prevalence rates of cognitive
decline have generally ranged from 20% to 55% in studies16,29 reporting results using RCI or standardized regression-based methodologies. Most studies, like the current

3353

Original Article

study, have not found an association between changes in
mood and changes in cognition. Declines in memory, executive function, and processing speed are most frequently
identified. However, the pattern and incidence of cognitive dysfunction is not always consistent between studies.
Potential reasons for this have been previously described29
and include inclusion of heterogeneous treatment regimens and patient populations, and application of incongruous criteria and/or statistical methods to determine
cognitive outcomes. Differences in the cognitive tests used
in different studies have also likely contributed significantly to discrepant findings. For example, different tests
of learning and memory have been used, frequently without alternate forms to reduce practice effects.1618,20,22,29,54,55
In the current trial, we used a learning and
memory test with alternate forms and found declines in
learning and memory to be the most common adverse
effect. Studies that did not use memory tests with alternate
forms may have underestimated the degree of cognitive
decline.56
Differences in control groups also likely contribute
to differences in reported rates of cognitive impairment
and cognitive decline. We used published normative data
from healthy controls in this study. When modeling
change over time (eg, when using RCI methodologies),
the RCI value will depend on the sample used to establish
this value. By using a common published control sample
(ie, normative studies) all investigators can compare their
data with a similar RCI value. Using only local control
samples will result in a variety of RCI values that will hamper comparisons across studies. Published normative data
from healthy controls usually contain larger sample sizes
that are likely to provide a better estimate of the population parameter under investigation (eg, memory). However, one must always balance this against potential
sample differences (eg, sociodemographic factors such as
age) that are related to the parameter under study and
may differ significantly between the study population and
the control population. Local control samples may afford
greater precision in measuring changes over time because
of consistency in test-retest intervals. However, although
some studies report practice effect differences based on
follow-up interval,30 others have found limited impact in
domains of cognition such as memory.31-34 Nevertheless,
studies in this area may benefit by obtaining both a large
matched local control sample and using tests with published normative data to benefit from the merits of both
approaches. On the basis of the results of this study, investigators may wish to consider using the HVLT-Revised

3354

and TMT as a component of their assessment batteries,
given their demonstrated relative sensitivity in this population, availability of alternate forms for the memory measure to diminish practice effects, good psychometric
properties and available population normative data.
This study replicates the findings from our previous
longitudinal trial in women with breast cancer receiving
FAC-based chemotherapy in which we observed frequent
acute decline in cognitive function that often did not
improve in the year after completion of chemotherapy.15
However, in the current study, we additionally observed
progressive and delayed cognitive decline that does not
appear to be attributable to other interventions (eg, chest
wall radiation or hormonal therapy) or progressive or metastatic disease. This is very concerning as clinical lore has
suggested that treatment-related cognitive dysfunction
should dissipate over time.
Recent preclinical animal models are helping define
potential mechanisms underlying chemotherapy-induced
cognitive dysfunction.35-43 Mice treated with fluorouracil
and methotrexate demonstrated acute deficits on cognitive tasks that assess the integrity of hippocampal and
frontal lobe function.37 Recently, it has been reported
that mice given clinically relevant doses of 5-fluorouracil
demonstrated both acute inflammation and vascular
injury, followed by delayed damage to myelinated tracts
in the brain.38 The acute inflammation and vascular
injury was transient and found primarily in the subventricular zone, dentate gyrus and corpus collosum, all of
which are critical for normal cognitive function. The
delayed effects included increased apoptosis, suppression
of proliferation in double-cortinþ neuronal progenitors
and oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte progenitor cells as
well as progressive loss of Olig2þ cells. Delayed damage
to myelinated tracts would be predicted to result in
diminished learning and memory, executive function, and
processing speed. The predicted pattern of cognitive dysfunction and the progressive and late emerging toxicity
caused by 5-fluorouracil in the animal model corresponds
with our observations in this study.
As the survivorship community continues to grow
and more cancer patients are at risk for both acute and
delayed cognitive decline, it is critical to understand the
pathophysiologic mechanisms. Clinical and translational
research using neuropsychological tests, imaging techniques, biomarkers, and animal models are essential to
accelerate our understanding of these toxicities, identify
at-risk subgroups, and develop intervention and neuroprotective strategies. Future neuropsychological studies

would benefit from examining larger samples of homogeneously treated patients to replicate these findings and to
determine whether these adverse effects are specific to certain chemotherapeutic regimens. Extending the postchemotherapy follow-up interval to at least 1 year is clearly
warranted and will help inform patients and clinicians
about critical survivorship issues.
