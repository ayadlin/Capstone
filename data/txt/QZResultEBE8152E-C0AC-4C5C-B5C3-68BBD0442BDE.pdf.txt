ABSTRACT
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy derived from the epithelial
cells of the nasopharynx. Although a combination of radiotherapy with chemotherapy
is effective for therapy, relapse and metastasis after remission remain major causes of
mortality. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is believed to be one of causes of NPC development.
We demonstrated previously that EBV reactivation is important for the carcinogenesis
of NPC. We sought, therefore, to determine whether EBV reactivation can be a target
for retardation of relapse of NPC. After screening, we found luteolin is able to inhibit
EBV reactivation. It inhibited EBV lytic protein expression and repressed the promoter
activities of two major immediate-early genes, Zta and Rta. Furthermore, luteolin
was shown to reduce genomic instability induced by recurrent EBV reactivation in
NPC cells. EBV reactivation-induced NPC cell proliferation and migration, as well as
matrigel invasiveness, were also repressed by luteolin treatment. Tumorigenicity
in mice, induced by EBV reactivation, was decreased profoundly following luteolin
administration. Together, these results suggest that inhibition of EBV reactivation is
a novel approach to prevent the relapse of NPC.

chemotherapy, the survival rate has increased significantly
[3–5]. However, relapse and metastasis after remission
remain major causes of mortality. Prevention of relapse
and metastasis seems to be the most important issue in the
study of NPC.
EBV, a member of the herpesviruses, has a linear
double-stranded DNA genome of around 170 kb. The
replication cycle includes latent and lytic stages and the
switch from latency to the lytic cycle is known as reactivation
[6, 7]. EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C and LP and LMPs 1, 2A
and 2B are expressed during latency. Upon reactivation to
the lytic cycle, the immediate early genes Zta and Rta are
expressed first, followed by the early genes (DNase, DNA
polymerase, thymidine kinase, etc.) and late genes (VCA and
MA, etc) [8]. Elevation of antibodies against EBV lytic gene
products has been considered as a marker of EBV reactivation
in vivo [9–11]. The infection is ubiquitous in most human
populations, with no obvious symptoms. This virus has been

INTRODUCTION
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy
derived from the epithelial cells of the post-nasal cavity
and has a unique geographic and ethnic distribution.
Although rare worldwide, it is prevalent in areas such as
southern China, Southeast Asia, northeast India, North
Africa and among the native population of Canada and
Alaska. There are an estimated 80,000 new cases per year
(0.7% of all cancers), less than 1 per 100,000 globally
[1]. The 5 years survival rate is 60%; treatment at early
stages of disease leads to a good 5-year survival rate (8095%) but not for late stage disease (40-50%). NPC is
markedly radiosensitive and radiotherapy is the primary
mode of treatment; however, chemoradiotherapy has been
shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone for advanced
NPC patients [2]. Recently, with the improvement in
combination of radiotherapy provided by neoadjuvant

shown to be the etiological agent of infectious mononucleosis
and is associated with many human malignancies, including
African Burkitt’s lymphoma and NPC [8].
EBV infection, consumption of nitroso-compounds
and genetic factors are considered to play important
roles in the carcinogenesis of NPC [12, 13]. Elevation of
antibodies against EBV in NPC patients and the presence
of the EBV genome and expression of EBV genes in NPC
tissues indicate the close association of EBV infection with
NPC [14–20]. Individuals with higher levels of antibodies
against EBV tend to have a high risk of NPC development
[19]. Recent epidemiological studies indicated that
fluctuation of antibodies to EBV occurs prior to the
onset of NPC [21, 22]. These results suggest that EBV
may contribute to the initiation of NPC. To elucidate the
role of EBV in the initiation of NPC, a model system of
EBV infection and reactivation in normal nasopharyngeal
epithelial cells is required urgently. Unfortunately, there is
no such model system available at this time.
Through years of studies, it was proposed that
latent EBV infection contributes to the development of
NPC after the high grade pre-invasive dysplasia [23].
Among the EBV latent proteins, latent membrane protein
1 (LMP1) is considered to make the most significant
contribution to the development of NPC. In addition to the
induction of genome instability [24–27], it has been shown
that LMP1 induces matrix metalloproteinase 1 to increase
metastasis, and interleukin-8 to increase angiogenesis, of
NPC [28–30]. One of the most interesting features is that
LMP1 induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1-α) and
this subsequently contributes to the increased expression
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [31].
Further study indicated the up-regulation of HIF1α is
through Siah1 to down-regulate prolyl hydroxylases 1
and 3 [32]. More strikingly, LMP1 was found to promote
NPC progression through increased levels of HIF1α in the
exosomes of NPC cells [33]. The pathogenic role of LMP1
in NPC has been reviewed recently [34].
In our laboratory, we have established the EBVpositive NPC cell lines, NA and HA [35] from the EBVnegative NPC line TW01, derived from an NPC patient
in Taiwan [36]. Because most NPC can be treated with
remission by radio-chemotherapy, NA, HA and TW01
cells are considered as residual EBV-positive and –
negative NPC cells after remission and may be informative
regarding the relapse of NPC. Using these cells as a model
system, we could investigate the role of EBV infection in
the carcinogenesis of NPC cells.
Genomic instability is one of the hallmarks of cancer
[37]. We found that recurrent EBV reactivation contributes
much more profoundly than latent infection to the
genomic instability and tumorigenesis of NPC cells [38].
We demonstrated further that the expression of EBV lytic
genes contributes to the genomic instability of NPC cells
[39–41]. In particular, recurrent expression of BALF3, a
homologue of terminase, does not induce cytotoxicity but
mediates genomic instability and progressive malignancy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[41]. These results suggest the importance of lytic
infection, probably abortive, for the relapse of NPC. We
therefore asked whether EBV reactivation can be a target
for the prevention or retardation of relapse of NPC.
Recently the “nutraceutical” concept has become
prominent. Scientific evidence has shown that vegetables
and fruits contain phytochemicals, such as polyphenols,
terpenes and alkaloids, that may provide substantial health
benefits, other than basic nutrition [42]. Epidemiological
studies indicate that populations that consume foods rich in
vegetables and fruits have a lower incidence of cancers [43].
Lycopenes from tomatoes and vitamin D have been shown
to be useful for the treatment of prostate cancers [44–46].
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are also considered
as potential cancer therapeutic agents and some are the
subjects of clinical trials [47]. In a region of China with a
high-risk for NPC, inhabitants living in a particular area with
a low NPC prevalence have a lower potential for endogenous
nitrosation, suggesting the presence of nitrosation inhibitors
in their diet [48]. It is worthwhile to seek more and better
natural products for NPC prevention. These results led us
to look for natural compounds which may prevent EBV
reactivation in NPC cells in order to find dietary supplements
which may be useful for the prevention of EBV reactivation
and subsequent NPC relapse after remission.
After extensive screening, we focused on luteolin, a
member of a group of dietary flavonoids found abundantly
in medicinal herbs, fruits and vegetables (e.g. parsley,
green peppers, citrus, celery and chamomile). Luteolin is
known to be a good free radical scavenger and inducer of
tumor apoptosis [49] and also has valuable effects in cancer
prevention and therapies [50]. It has been reported to have
good effects in anti-angiogenesis, anti-metastasis, antiinflammation and estrogenic regulation, and to regulate
many signaling pathways [51, 52]. However, although a few
studies have been published, the question whether luteolin
has anti-viral activity is less well understood [53, 54].
In this study, using the NPC cell lines NA and HA,
luteolin is shown to inhibit EBV reactivation significantly by
suppressing the promoter activities of two immediate-early
genes, Zta and Rta. Furthermore, we found that luteolin
treatment not only suppressed EBV reactivation but also
reduced genomic instability and repressed the tumorigenic
features induced by repeated EBV reactivation in vitro and
in vivo, suggesting that inhibition of EBV reactivation is a
novel target to overcome the relapse of NPC.

RESULTS
The cytotoxicity of luteolin to NPC cells,
determined by WST-1 assay
Luteolin is a flavone with a classic flavonoid
2-phenylchromene-4-one ring structure (Figure 1). NA
and another EBV-infected NPC cell line, HA, were
used to address the question whether luteolin can inhibit
EBV lytic reactivation. First, we sought to determine

the cytotoxicity of luteolin to NA, HA and their parental
TW01 and HONE-1 cells, to rule out any effect of cellular
toxicity. Each cell line was cultured in 96-well plates
and, after plating, various concentrations of luteolin
were administered for 24 hr or 48 hr to determine its
cytotoxicity by WST-1 assay. The values of half maximum
of cytotoxicity concentration 50 (CC50) for 48 hr treatment
of NA and TW01 were 124 and 115 μM, while the values
for HA and HONE-1 were 78 μM and 68 μM (data not
shown). Taken together, we determined that the CC50 value
of luteolin was 68 to 272 μM for 24 and 48 hrs, which
is similar to that in other epithelial cancer cells [54, 55].
Thus we chose 1~50 μM as our working concentrations
for further studies.

After induction or stimulation, the first lytic EBV
proteins to be expressed are the immediate early proteins,
Zta and Rta, followed by numerous early and late proteins,
and subsequently the release of infectious virions. To
investigate whether luteolin induces EBV into the lytic
cycle, NA cells were plated for 24 hr and then the cells were
treated with various concentrations of luteolin. After 25 or
49 hr, cell extracts were harvested for western analysis. As
expected, luteolin did not induce expression of the lytic
proteins Zta, Rta, EAD and DNase after treatment for 25
and 49 hr, shown in the left panels of Figure 2a, suggesting

subjected to western blotting. Various concentrations of luteolin were added to the cells for 25 hr to detect enhancement of reactivation. Cell
lysates were collected for western blotting. For detection of inhibition of reactivation, the cells were pre-treated with various concentrations
of luteolin for 1 hr, then TPA (40 ng/ml) and SB (3 mM) co-treatment was used for EBV induction. After 24 and 48 hr of incubation, cell
lysates were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against EBV Zta, Rta, EAD, DNase and GAPDH.

that it could not induce the EBV lytic cycle in NA cells.
To avoid the possibility of cell specificity, another EBVpositive cell line, HA, was examined using the same
procedure and with a similar result: luteolin treatment also
did not induce EBV reactivation in HA cells (left panels,
Figure 2b). Next, we tried to determine whether luteolin can
block EBV reactivation from latency. For NA and HA cells,
TPA+SB (TS) treatment is a common inducer of EBV lytic
reactivation and can activate EBV effectively and induce
significant expression of lytic proteins [35]. Moreover,
detection of lytic protein expression is a sensitive method
for evaluating EBV reactivation [35]. In order to ensure
more effective luteolin treatment, NA and HA cells were
pre-incubated with various concentrations of luteolin for 1
hr prior to treatment with TPA (40 ng/ml) and SB (3 mM).
After further incubation for 24 or 48 hr, cell extracts were
collected for the detection of lytic proteins by western blot
analysis. As shown in the right-hand panels of Figure 2a,
TPA+SB treatment induced the expression of the EBV
lytic proteins Zta, Rta, EAD and DNase without luteolin
treatment. Meanwhile, the expression of EBV lytic proteins
was reduced slightly following treatment with 1 and 5
μM luteolin for 24 and 48 hr induction, and decreased
significantly with 5 μM luteolin for 24 hr and 10 μM for
48 hr induction. Lytic protein expression was undetectable
following treatment with 20 and 50 μM luteolin for 24
and 48 hr after induction (Figure 2a). In HA cells, luteolin
inhibited lytic protein expression significantly with 10 μM
treatment for 24 hr and 50 μM for 48 hr, which were higher

concentrations than used for the treatment of NA cells (right
panels, Figure 2b). Luteolin inhibited all detectable EBV
lytic protein expression completely at 50 μM, which was
similar to the treatment of NA cells (right panels, Figure 2b).
Similarly, luteolin had an inhibitory effect on the expression
of EBV lytic proteins after induction in C666-1 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1a). Taken together, these results
suggest that the flavonoid luteolin cannot induce EBV into
the lytic cycle but, rather, inhibited EBV entry into the lytic
cycle in EBV-positive cells.

Luteolin decreases the populations of EADexpressing cells, monitored by flow cytometric
analysis
Next, we examined the inhibition of EBV lytic
reactivation by luteolin and detected EAD expression
in NA and HA cells using flow cytometric analysis after
luteolin treatment, with and without TS induction. NA and
HA cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of
luteolin for 1 hr, then co-treated with TPA (40 ng/ml)/SB
(3 mM). After 48 hr induction, the cells were collected
for detection of EAD by flow cytometric analysis. The
percentage of EAD expressing cells was estimated to
determine the amount of EBV lytic reactivation. For NA
cells with 48 hr induction by TS, the population of EADpositive cells was 52% without luteolin treatment, while
it was 25% and 8% after treatment with 10 μM and 20
μM luteolin, respectively (Figure 3a). Meanwhile, 50%

antibody against EBV EAD. TS: TPA+SB; TS-Lut10 μM: TPA+SB+luteolin (10 μM); TS-Lut20 μM: TPA+SB+luteolin (20 μM).

of HA cells expressed EAD after TS induction without
luteolin treatment (Figure 3b), lower than NA cells (52%).
The percentages of HA cells expressing EAD were 44%
and 4% following treatment with10 and 20 μM luteolin,
respectively (Figure 3b). These results provide further
evidence that luteolin can inhibit the EBV lytic cycle.

showed that all values were at background levels
(Figure 4a, upper panel).
Furthermore, we used SB alone to induce EBV
reactivation and tried to analyze this phenomenon in detail.
For SB induction, the result was that SB-induced Zp and
Rp activities were similar to induction by TS (Figure 4a,
lower panel, 0 μM). Even so, luteolin repressed Zp and
Rp activities gradually with increasing concentrations
(Figure 4a, lower panel, 0-50 μM), compared to the mock
control, following SB induction.
To avoid the influence of endogenous EBV in NA
cells, we used the parental TW01 cells for the analysis,
as described above. The relative folds of Zp and Rp
activities were lower than those in NA cells following
TS induction (Figure 4b). Similarly, regardless of the
treatment (TS or SB), luciferase activities of Zp and Rp
were repressed gradually by increasing concentrations of
luteolin (Figure 4b), suggesting that luteolin can inhibit Zp
and Rp activities following chemical induction.

Luteolin represses the transcriptional activities
of Zp and Rp
Because the activities of the Zta and Rta promoters
(Zp and Rp) are crucial for initiation of the EBV lytic
cycle, we sought to determine whether luteolin can inhibit
their transcriptional activities using a transient transfection
assay. NA cells were transfected with Zp (pZp-Luc) or
Rp (pRp-Luc) firefly luciferase reporter plasmid for 3
hr. Subsequently, the cells were treated with various
amounts of luteolin for 1 hr followed by TS induction for
24 hr. Luciferase activity was subsequently determined
as described in Material and Methods. As expected, for
the positive control, the luciferase activities of Zp and Rp
both increased over 15-fold after TS induction, compared
to the mock-transfected control (Figure 4a, upper panel, 0
μM). At the same time, the luciferase activities of Zp and
Rp were gradually repressed by increasing concentrations
of luteolin (Figure 4a, upper panel). Co-treatment with
TS and 50 μM luteolin reduced the activities of Zp and
Rp to the mock-transfected control level, meanwhile,
transfection of NA cells with the empty vector PGL2

Inhibition of recurrent EBV reactivation by
luteolin decreased reactivation-induced genomic
instability in NA cells
EBV reactivation has been shown to be important
for tumorigenesis. In our previous study, we showed
that recurrent EBV reactivation leads to more profound
genomic instability and tumorigenesis than seen during
EBV latency, implying that EBV reactivation may be

1 hr, and then different methods (TS(TPA+SB) and SB only) were used to induce EBV into the lytic cycle. After induction for 24 hr, cells
lysates were collected for measurement of luciferase activity. The mean and standard deviation of each sample was calculated based on
duplicates from at least two independent experiments.

a potential target against tumorigenesis [38, 56]. Based
on these observations, we postulated that inhibition of
the EBV lytic reactivation by luteolin could repress
reactivation-induced genomic instability and malignancy.
To test this hypothesis, we modified the culture system
to carry out repeated reactivation combined with luteolin
administration to examine the impact of inhibition of EBV
reactivation on genomic instability and the malignant
characteristics of NA cells (Figure 5). The EBV-positive
cell line NA and its parental EBV-negative cell line TW01
were included in parallel to compare the effects between
treatment with inducers (TS) alone (in TW01 cells) and
chemical-induced EBV reactivation (in NA cells). MN
formation was determined for the alteration of genomic
instability. As shown in Figure 6a, TW01 cells after one
passage (TW01-P1) with 20 μl luteolin treatment did not
increase the extent of MN formation. If the cells in the
TW01-P1 group were treated with TS, slightly increased
formation of MN was observed; however, no significant
difference could be detected in the extent of MN formation
under TS and luteolin co-treatment (Figure 6a). On the
other hand, in EBV-positive NA cells after one passage
(NA-P1), although luteolin alone did not inhibit the
formation of MN, it repressed TS-induced MN formation
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6a). In the TW01
cells after 10 passages (TW01-P10), similar to the
TW01-P1 group, low levels of MN formation occurred,
regardless of the types of chemical treatment (Figure 6b).

This result indicated that, without the impact of EBV, a
subtle increase in MN formation was induced in NPC
cells following TS treatment, which was similar to our
previous observations [38, 56]. Moreover, NA cells after
10 passages with TS treatment (NA-P10) exhibited a
more profound increase than the NA-P1 group in terms
of the formation of MN, revealing that recurrent EBV
reactivation caused accumulation of MN, compared to
the mock control (Figure 6b). Furthermore, increasing
amounts of luteolin could repress the formation of MN
gradually, in both the NA-P1 and NA-P10 groups (Figure
6b). Similarly, luteolin inhibited MN formation after TS
induction in C666-1 cells and HA cells (Supplementary
Figures S1b and S1d). These results suggest that luteolin
can effectively repress the formation of MN induced by
EBV reactivation.

Luteolin inhibits cell proliferation induced by
recurrent EBV reactivation
An increase in cell proliferation is a common feature
of carcinogenic cells. To determine whether luteolin can
suppress cell proliferation triggered by recurrent EBV
reactivation, a WST-1 assay was performed to detect the
survival rate of NA and TW01 cells treated by repeated
TS induction, without or with luteolin. For NA cells, the
TS treatment group exhibited accelerated cell proliferation
compared to the mock control; however, this decreased

Figure 5: Representative illustration of recurrent chemical treatment of NPC cells. Cells were mock or treated repeatedly
with the chemicals indicated. The cells at the beginning of this procedure were defined as passage 0 cells (P0). After seeding, the cells were
treated with luteolin for 1 hr or not, followed by treatment with TPA (40 ng/ml) and SB (3 mM). After incubation for 24 hr, the cells were
allowed to recover by incubation with fresh medium for a further 48 hr. These resulting cells were defined as passage 1 cells (P1). The
procedure was repeated for 10 times. “Pn” represents treated NPC cells, where n means the passage number of the cells. TS, Lut10 and

gradually with luteolin treatment (Figure 7a). On the other
hand, there was no obvious change among the groups of
TW01 cells (Figure 7b). These results suggested that
luteolin can inhibit cell proliferation induced by repeated
EBV reactivation.

of NPC cells, repeated EBV reactivation was carried
out without and with luteolin treatment for analysis of
the tumorigenic phenotypes, including cell migration,
cell invasion and spheroid formation. EBV-positive NA
cells under recurrent TS induction were subjected to cell
migration assays and the degrees of migration increased
significantly compared to the mock control, however,
this decreased following treatment with luteolin (Figure
8a and 8b). This migration inhibition was not seen in
TW01 cells treated with luteolin (Figure 8a and 8b). In
addition, invasion of NA cells was accelerated in the
group undergoing repeated TS induction and this was
repressed when luteolin was added (Figure 9a and 9b).
This inhibition of invasion also was not seen using TW01
cells treated with luteolin (Figure 9a and 9b).

The tumorigenic properties of NPC cells,
induced by EBV reactivation, were repressed
with luteolin treatment
In addition to genomic instability, EBV
reactivation increased a number of tumorigenic
properties in NPC cells, including cell migration, cell
invasion and spheroid formation [57]. To determine
whether luteolin could inhibit these malignant properties

Inhibition of EBV reactivation by luteolin
represses tumor growth in a mouse model

Cancer cells are present in three-dimensional
structures in vivo. The formation of multicellular spheroids
mimics a tissue-like architecture and exhibits cell-cell
contact with intercellular adhesion. Here, in our spheroid
formation assay, the TS-treated NA cells formed larger
spheroids than the mock control but spheroid formation
was repressed after addition of luteolin. However, a
similar phenomenon could not be demonstrated in TW01
cells (Figure 10a and 10b). Interestingly, little inhibition
of migration and invasiveness was detectable in NA and
TW01 cells treated with luteolin alone but this effect was
not statically significant (Figures 8 and 9).

Based on the observation that treatment with
luteolin dramatically decreased the tumorigenic properties
of NPC cells, induced by recurrent EBV reactivation, we
sought to determine whether luteolin repressed tumor
growth induced by repeated EBV reactivation in a mouse
model (Figure 11a). We first tried to establish the mouse
model of EBV reactivation with chemical induction
in NA cells. NA cells (2 x 106 cells) were inoculated
subcutaneously into SCID mice. After tumor appearance

for 4 weeks, the mice were separated into several
groups and SB, SB+luteolin, TS and TS+luteolin were
administered intraperitoneally every 3 or 4 days (Figure
11a). The tumors were harvested after two further weeks
of development and analyzed for Zta and EAD expression
to detect EBV reactivation. With no obvious toxicity in
terms of mouse body weights (Figure 11b), the tumors
from SB and TS–treated mice had significant expression
of EBV lytic proteins; however, protein expression was
repressed in the luteolin-treated mice (Figure 11c). After

successful establishment of the mouse model of EBV
reactivation, tumorigenicity experiments were carried out
to determine whether luteolin could repress reactivation–
induced tumor growth. NA and TW01 cells (2 x 106 cells)
were inoculated subcutaneously into SCID mice. After
tumor appearance, mice implanted with NA and TW01
cells were separated into several groups and were injected
intraperitoneally with mock-treatment (water control),
SB or SB+luteolin every 3 or 4 days, as described above
(Figure 11a). The tumors were harvested after two further

weeks of development for analysis of their growth. In
NA-injected mice, we found tumor growth was enhanced
after SB administration; however, this was inhibited by
luteolin treatment (Figure 11d, left panel and 11e, upper
panel). In addition, tumor growth in the SB-treated
group was increased with NA cells, but not TW01 cells,
at 28-day after SB treatment, compared to the mock
control, suggesting EBV reactivation plays a causative
role in the tumorigenisis of NPC cells in vivo (Figure
11e). Collectively, these results indicate that luteolin has
a suppressive effect on NPC tumorigenesis in the mouse
model by inhibition of EBV reactivation.

course, a monoclonal tumor may develop after polyclonal
B-cell proliferation [59]. The association of high rate
malignant tumor occurrence with immunosuppression
in renal homotransplantation was reported by TE Starzl
after observation from 1962 to 1964 [60]. Subsequent
reports corroborated this finding [61, 62]. Elevation of
antibodies against EBV was found in patient sera [63]
and EBV was detected in the oropharyngeal secretions
[64]. Further studies indicated the disease may also be
caused by EBV reinfection [65] or primary infection
[66]. Treatment with acyclovir suppressed polyclonal
B-cell proliferation [67] and PTLD [68], indicating
that EBV reactivation plays an important role in these
disorders. It was suggested that cytotoxic T cells against
EBV-infected B cells were suppressed in renal transplant
recipients after immunosuppression [69]. Withdrawal of
immunosuppression was found to render the regression
of PTLD, supporting the crucial role of cellular immunity
in the development of PTLD [70]. With the development

DISCUSSION
EBV has been associated with many human
malignancies, although how it contributes to
carcinogenesis is largely unknown [8]. The contribution
of the lytic genes of EBV has been the most extensively
studied in the etiology of EBV-induced posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV-PTLD) after solid
organ transplantation (reviewed in [58]). In the clinical

EBV lytic genes to the oncogenesis of PTLD. BZLF1
was shown to be important in the development of LCL
tumors in SCID mice through induction of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [72]. BZLF1 also
was found to enhance the tumor formation by BZLF1deleted LCL in SCID mice, through increased expression
of IL-6 and IL-10 [73]. A humanized mouse model
containing human CD34 cells (hematopoietic cells),
thymus and liver tissues provided evidence that host
cellular immunity contributes to the suppression of
development of LPD [74]. Using superlytic (SL) mutants
and OKT3 and anti-CD3 antibodies, a further study
supported the contributions of EBV lytic infection and
human cellular immunity to the development of LPC
[75]. It was suggested that horizontal transmission of
EBV may be important for PTLD formation and lytic
EBV may contribute through paracrine effects and/or
immunosuppression [74]. Similarly, reactivation of EBV
was found to contribute to the tumorigenesis of NPC
cells [38]. In this study, we wanted to determine whether
reactivation of EBV can be a target in the management
of NPC after remission.

For the contribution of lytic EBV genes to NPC
tumorigenesis, we found chemical induced reactivation of
EBV can promote genome instability and tumor formation
in SCID mice [38, 56, 76]. In this study, we screened out
the flavonoid luteolin as a viral inhibitor to block latent
EBV entry into the lytic cycle. We demonstrated that
appropriate doses of luteolin can inhibit the expression
of EBV lytic proteins through repression of Zp and Rp
activities (Figures 2-4), suggesting that luteolin is a
promising agent for inhibiting the initial stage of latent
EBV transition to lytic reactivation. Furthermore, we
also found that luteolin treatment blocked the formation
of MN and several tumorigenic properties of NPC cells
(Figures 7-10). In a newly established mouse model,
luteolin repressed reactivation-induced tumor formation
(Figure 11), suggesting that luteolin can repress NPC
tumorigenesis by inhibiting EBV reactivation.
“Antimicrobial adjuvant therapy” has been
proposed recently to treat virus-related cancers
and cancer-associated infections. Targeting cancerrelated viruses with antiviral agents is currently used
in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas [77],

HHV8-associated cancers [78] and hematopoietic
cancers [79], and this has yielded some compelling
data to support their clinical use in combination with
traditional therapies. Several anti-EBV or induction-lytic

strategies have been proposed for the treatment of EBVrelated malignancies [80–91]. Based on our previous
studies, the EBV lytic cycle was found to be crucial to
the tumorigenesis of NPC cells and some lytic proteins

MATERIALS AND METHODS

are known to have mutagenic or carcinogenic properties
[38–41]. Taking EBV reactivation as an oncotarget, it is
worth considering retarding or repressing the recurrence
of NPC using natural products.
Luteolin is a flavonoid found in our diet, albeit
in relatively low amounts (<1 mg/day) [50, 52].
Epidemiological studies have revealed an inverse
correlation between luteolin consumption and the risk
of some cancers [92–95]. Furthermore, luteolin has
been shown to have significant anti-carcinogenic effects
through induction of anti-oxidation, anti-proliferation and
apoptosis via multiple signaling pathways, in vitro and
in vivo [52, 96]. Luteolin has been shown to block Akt
phosphorylation in TNF-α induced murine non-carcinoma
intestinal epithelial cells [97]. Luteolin also has inhibitory
effects in MAPK/ERK signaling and the PI3-K cascade
[98, 99]. In our laboratory, we found luteolin can repress
phosphorylation of the ERK, p38, JNK and PKC pathways
in NA cells (data not shown). Of note, blocking of the Akt,
MAPK/ERK or PI3K pathways was shown to be important
in preventing EBV reactivation [100, 101], suggesting
inhibition of these signals by luteolin may contribute to its
anti-viral and anti-cancer properties.
In investigating its modes of action, luteolin
was found to cause significant inhibition of Zp and
Rp activities (Figure 4). The mechanism is similar to
EGCG and andrographolide, which also inhibit Zp and
Rp activities [102, 103]. On the contrary, curcumin and
retinoid acid inhibit Zp [104] and moronic acid inhibits Rp
activity [105]. In addition, SFN inhibits EBV reactivation
by interfering with Rta transactivity [106]. Because Zp
activation is the most important step in EBV reactivation
in B cells, whereas Rp activation is critical in epithelial
cells, compounds inhibiting both promoter activities,
e.g. luteolin and EGCG, have better potential for clinical
application. In addition, we found that luteolin blocks
EBV reactivation by repressing the Zta and Rta promoter
activities, disrupting Sp1 binding (data not shown). These
functions will provide more potential for anti-cancer and
anti-viral therapy.
In summary, we show that luteolin inhibits EBV
reactivation by repressing the promoter activities of
Zp and Rp. Furthermore, through inhibition of EBV
reactivation, luteolin decreases viral reactivationinduced genomic instability and malignant features,
such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
spheroid formation. Luteolin also represses tumor
growth in a mouse model. We propose here that EBV
reactivation may be a novel target for prevention or
retardation of NPC relapse and luteolin may provide
a new solution to the drug-resistance problem and
have potential as a lead for drug development. It also
provides an alternative choice for antiviral therapy and
prevention.

Compounds and antibodies
Luteolin
and
the
induction
agents,
12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-1,3-acetate (TPA) and
sodium butyrate(SB), were purchased from SigmaAldrich Co. Antibodies used in this study include antiEBV Rta 467 (unpublished), anti-BMRF1 (EAD) 88A9
[107], anti-EBV Zta 4F10, anti-DNase 311H [108], antiβ-actin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and anti-GAPDH (SigmaAldrich Co.).

Cell lines
TW01 is a human EBV-negative NPC cell
line established from a Taiwanese NPC patient [36].
HONE-1 is another human EBV-negative NPC cell line,
from a Chinese NPC patient [109]. NA and HA cells, are
EBV converted cells obtained by co-culture of rAkata
cells and TW01 and HONE-1 cells, respectively, and
were selected by G418 (Sigma-Aldrich Co) treatment
[35]. All of the above cell lines and their derivatives were
maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).
C666-1 is a NPC cell lines derived from an NPC xenograft
of southern Chinese origin [110]. It is maintained in
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% FCS.

EBV induction by TPA plus SB and luteolin
administration
The EBV-positive NPC cell lines (NA and HA) were
seeded for 24 hr before carrying out the experiments. To
determine whether luteolin can inhibit EBV reactivation,
the cells were pre-treated for 1 hr with various
concentrations of luteolin. TPA (40 ng/ml) and SB (3 mM)
were added subsequently to co-treat to the cells for EBV
induction. After 24 or 48 hr incubation, the cells and their
extracts were collected for further studies.

Flow cytometric analysis
To determine the number of cells which switched
into the lytic cycle, cells were treated as indicated,
harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were
permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 4% FBS and
incubated with anti-EAD antibody (dilution 1:10) for 2
hr at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-mouse
IgG rhodamine-conjugated antibody for 1 hr and then
washed and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Each
experiment was in duplicate with 10,000 cells.

Transfection and analysis of luciferase reporter
activity

Cell migration assay
Cell migration assays were carried out using
the Oris system, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Platypus Technologies). Briefly, the
cells were seeded in 96-well plates with Oris stoppers
and then incubated for 24 hr. The stoppers were then
removed and the cells were incubated for a further
24 hr to permit cell migration. Finally, the cells
were analyzed with PI staining and photographed by
microscopy (Olympus). The closure of the cell-free
zone was detected by Image J software (National
Institute of Health). The cell migration was presented
as the percentage of closure calculated using the
following equation: [(pre-migration)area-(migration)area/
(pre-migration)area]x100. The results of at least three
independent experiments were used to calculate the
mean and standard deviation.

The construction of the Zp and Rp reporter plasmids
has been described in previous reports [76, 106, 111]. Zp and
Rp reporter plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, NA or TW01 cells were seeded (2x105/
well) for Zp and Rp activation by TPA/SB. The Zp or Rp
plasmid, mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen), was incubated for
20 min, then added to the culture wells containing the
cells. After 3 hr transfection, luteolin was added or not for
pre-treatment for 1 hr, and then TPA (40 ng/ml) plus SB
(3 mM) or SB (3 mM) alone were added to induce EBV
into the lytic cycle. After induction for 24 hr, the cells were
lysed in 50 μl HEPES buffer (0.1M HEPES, pH 7.8, 1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2) and 25 μl of
the lysates were combined with 25 μl of Luciferase Assay
Reagent II (Promega) for 10 min incubation. Finally, the
luciferase activity was measured using a luminescence
counter (Packard). Each lysate sample was quantified for
the expression of β-actin to control for variation in the
amount of sample (data not shown). The mean and standard
deviation of each sample were calculated from three
independent experiments in duplicate.

In vivo tumorigenesis model
Six-week-old SCID mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with NA cells (2 x 106 cells) and
examined over 4 weeks for tumor appearance. When the
tumor size reached approximately 0.5 cm in diameter,
the mice were separated into groups, each containing
three mice. The 1st group served as the control. The
2nd, 3rd and 4th groups received 0.6, 1.2 mg/kg SB
and 0.6 mg/kg SB plus 1 mg/kg TPA, respectively,
delivered by IP injection every 3 or 4 days. The 5th
and 6th groups received 40 mg/kg of luteolin, delivered
by IP injection every 3 or 4 days, before treatment
with the inducers. Two weeks later, the animals were
sacrificed and the tumors were excised and extracted
to examine the expressions of EBV lytic proteins. For
in vivo tumorigenesis assays, mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with NA cells for 4 weeks and, when
the tumor size reached approximately 0.5 cm in
diameter, the mice were separated into three groups,
each containing six mice. The 1st group served as the
control, the 2nd group received 0.6 mg/kg SB, delivered
by IP injection every 3 or 4 days, the 3rd group received
40 mg/kg of luteolin, delivered by IP injection every 3
or 4 days, before the treatment with the inducers. The
health of the mice and tumor sizes were monitored 3
or 4 days and the diameters of tumors were measured
using calipers. Two weeks later, the animals were
sacrificed and the tumors were excised for measurement
and weighing.

Determination of MN formation
Detection of MN formation was carried out as
described previously [24]. The cells under repeated
treatment with inducers combined with or without
luteolin were seeded onto coverslips to adhere. After 24 h
incubation, the culture medium was removed and the cells
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
pH7.4). The cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15
min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were stained
with Hoechst. (0.2 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) for 15 minutes. Micronuclei were judged using a
fluorescence microscope.

Cell proliferation assay
The cytotoxicity of luteolin to each cell line was
determined by WST-1 assay (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, NA and TW01 cells
(5×103 cells/well) and HA and HONE-1 cells (1×104
cells/well) were cultured in 96 well plates for 24 hr and
48 hr. Various concentrations of luteolin (0, 1, 5, 10, 20,
50 and 100 μM) were incubated with the cells for 24 or
48 hr and the cytotoxicity was analyzed by WST-1 assay.
The fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader
(Infinite M200, Tecan). The half maximum of cytotoxicity
concentration (CC50) was defined as the concentration of
luteolin which killed 50% of the cells. The results of at
least three independent experiments were used to calculate
the mean and standard deviation.

Spheroid assay
Cells were seeded into non-coating 10 cm-plates
to maintain their suspension and incubated at 37°C
for 7 days. After incubation, the spheroids sizes were
photographed and their sizes determined using Image J
software.
