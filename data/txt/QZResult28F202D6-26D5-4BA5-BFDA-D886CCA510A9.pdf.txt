Abstract
The ErbB family of receptors is overexpressed in numerous
human tumors. Overexpression correlates with poor prognosis
and resistance to therapy. Use of ErbB-specific antibodies to
the receptors (Herceptin or Erbitux) or ErbB-specific smallmolecule inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity
(Iressa or Tarceva) has shown clinical efficacy in several solid
tumors. An alternative method of affecting ErbB-initiated
tumor growth and survival is to block sheddase activity.
Sheddase activity is responsible for cleavage of multiple ErbB
ligands and receptors, a necessary step in availability of the
soluble, active form of the ligand and a constitutively activated
ligand-independent receptor. This sheddase activity is attributed to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of
proteins. ADAM 10 is the main sheddase of epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and HER-2/neu cleavage, whereas ADAM17 is
required for cleavage of additional EGF receptor (EGFR)
ligands (transforming growth factor-A, amphiregulin, heregulin, heparin binding EGF-like ligand). This study has shown
that addition of INCB3619, a potent inhibitor of ADAM10 and
ADAM17, reduces in vitro HER-2/neu and amphiregulin
shedding, confirming that it interferes with both HER-2/neu
and EGFR ligand cleavage. Combining INCB3619 with a
lapatinib-like dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2/neu kinases
resulted in synergistic growth inhibition in MCF-7 and HER-2/
neu–transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Combining
the INCB7839 second-generation sheddase inhibitor with lapatinib prevented the growth of HER-2/neu–positive BT474-SC1
human breast cancer xenografts in vivo. These results suggest
that there may be an additional clinical benefit of combining
agents that target the ErbB pathways at multiple points.

Introduction
The ErbB family of receptors is made up of four members, the
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR; ErbB1/HER1),
ErbB2/HER2-neu, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4. When their
appropriate ligands, e.g., EGF, transforming growth factor-a
(TGF-a), heparin binding EGF-like ligand (HB-EGF), amphiregulin,
heregulin, or betacellulin (1–3), bind to the receptor ectodomain,
formation of homodimers or heterodimers between family

members occurs (1, 3, 4). HER-2/neu is the preferred partner for
heterodimerization following ligand binding (1, 5, 6). This
homodimer and heterodimer formation triggers activation of
numerous downstream pathways, e.g., the RAS/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways
(1, 4), making ErbB family members important regulators of growth
and survival.
Cancer cells often produce and secrete growth factors as well as
express their corresponding receptors, allowing for stimulation of
cell growth through autocrine mechanisms (1, 7–10). This
coexpression of ErbB receptors and ligands correlates with
aggressive disease and poor prognosis in several tumor types
(1, 10–13). Overexpression also often confers resistance to chemotherapies and antihormonal cancer treatments. This has made
them attractive targets for the treatment of EGFR and HER-2/neu–
overexpressing tumors. Current treatments consist of antibodies
that directly bind to specific receptors, e.g., trastuzumab (Herceptin) and cetuximab (Erbitux), or inhibitors that interfere with
signaling of the receptor by blocking receptor kinase activity, e.g.,
erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa).
Lapatinib is a potent reversible inhibitor of both EGFR and HER2/neu tyrosine kinases (14). It is relatively specific for these kinases
and results in cytostatic or cytotoxic effects, depending on tumor
cell type (14, 15). Lapatinib exposure causes decreased phosphorylation of EGFR and HER-2/neu in vitro and in vivo (14–16). It also
causes decreased phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2 and Akt and
decreased expression of cyclin D, downstream effectors of cell
proliferation and survival pathways (14–16).
Compared with monoclonal antibodies (mAb), which target
epitopes on the extracellular domain (ECD), small molecules, such
as lapatinib, exert effects intracellularly. mAbs have limited effects
in the presence of mutated and/or truncated forms of the
receptors. In addition, constitutively activated receptors cannot
be affected by mAbs.
ErbB ligands must be cleaved to be released in the soluble form
capable of activating ErbB signaling (1). ErbB receptors are also
subject to cleavage, resulting in constitutively activated ligandindependent signaling (3, 17). Cleavage of the HER-2/neu receptor
liberates the ectodomain (ECD), leaving the remaining, constitutively active p95 membrane bound portion (3, 18). As with
overexpression of tumor HER-2/neu levels, elevated HER-2/neu
ECD in serum has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis
and reduced effectiveness of some therapies in cancer patients
(3, 18, 19).
Sheddase is an enzymatic activity attributed to the ADAM
(a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of proteins that is
involved in the ectodomain cleavage of ErbB ligands and receptors

(3, 20, 21). ADAM17 has been suggested to be the major ErbB ligand
sheddase, with a role in the cleavage of multiple ligands, e.g.,
TGF-a, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin (1, 3, 21, 22). ADAM17 has been
found to be up-regulated in a number of tumor types, including
breast and non–small cell lung cancer, where it is required for
HER3 and EGFR signaling (1, 23). ADAM10, however, is believed to
be the main sheddase of EGF and betacellulin in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (1, 3, 21) and is at least one of the sheddases responsible
for HER-2/neu cleavage (3). Small interfering RNAs that selectively
inhibit ADAM10 expression have been shown to reduce HER-2/neu
shedding (3).
Sheddase inhibitors are potent small-molecule inhibitors of
ADAM10 and ADAM17 that prevent ErbB ligand and receptor
cleavage, thereby preventing availability of multiple ligands,
activation of the ligand/receptor complex, and subsequent cellular
growth and survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
combination of a sheddase inhibitor and HER-2/neu–directed
therapies on the growth of human breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Materials. The HER-2/neu–transfected MCF-7 cell line, MCF/18, was
supplied by Genentech, Inc. Human breast cancer cell line BT-474 was
obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection. INCB3619
was a gift from Incyte Corporation. The HER-2/neu ELISA kit was a gift
from Oncogene Science. The HER-2/neu ELISA is a sandwich enzyme
immunoassay that uses a mouse monoclonal antibody for capture and a
different biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically detects
the extracellular domain of human HER-2/neu protein. GW2974, the dual
lapatinib-like inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2/neu, was produced by
GlaxoSmithKline and purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Lapatinib used for
animal studies was synthesized by the Incyte Chemistry Department.
Cell growth experiments. The MCF-7 cells were grown in high glucose
DMEM and MCF/18 cells were maintained in a 50:50 mix of Ham’s medium
and high glucose DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine. Both cell lines
were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in 5% CO2
at 37jC. G418 was added to the MCF/18 cell medium to support continued
transfection. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 20,000 per well
and incubated overnight to allow attachment. Cells were treated with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

various concentrations of INCB3619 (0.25–40 Amol/L) and/or GW2974
(0.025–1 Amol/L). As a control, cells were treated with corresponding
concentrations of DMSO, the solvent for both agents. The cells were
incubated for an additional 3 d, and the cell number was determined using
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Each
single dose and combination was done in triplicate in each assay. Percent of
control was normalized to control (untreated) cells (100% growth).
Statistical analysis. Synergism of the growth-inhibitory effects was
determined using Biosoft CalcuSyn software. This program calculated
the combination index (CI) equation based on the equation of Chou-Talalay
(24, 25).
HER-2/neu shedding experiments. HER-2/neu–transfected MCF-7
cells were plated in 75-cm2 flasks at a concentration of 750,000 cells per
flask. After an overnight incubation to allow attachment, INCB3619 or the
corresponding amount of DMSO (control) was added and an additional 3 d
incubation was done. The supernatant was then centrifuged to remove
cellular debris and measurement of HER-2/neu shedding was done using a
HER-2/neu ELISA kit specific for the ectodomain of human HER-2/neu
(Oncogene Science). The supernatant was incubated in microwell plates to
allow binding of the antigen by the capture antibody immobilized on the
surface of the wells. The immobilized antigen reacted with a detector
antibody. The antigen/detector antibody was measured by binding it with
a streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase conjugate, which catalyzed the conversion of the chromogenic substrate o-phenylenediamine into a colored
product. Quantitation of HER-2/neu is done by reading the absorbance at
490 nm on a microplate reader.
Amphiregulin shedding experiments. MCF-7 cells were seeded at
20,000 per well in 96-well plates in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum and
allowed to adhere overnight in 5% CO2 at 37jC. The following morning,
the cells were pretreated with various concentrations of INCB3619
(100 nmol/L–10 Amol/L) for 10 min. As a control, cells were treated with
corresponding concentrations of DMSO. The cells were then stimulated
with 1 Amol/L phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem) for 2 h;
supernatants were harvested and assayed for amphiregulin levels using an
amphiregulin-specific ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell signaling experiments. MCF/18 cells were treated as described
above for the cell growth experiments. After 3 d, supernatants were
removed, cell extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysis for the
presence of phosphorylated ERK, AKT, and HER-3 was done as described
previously (1).

Inhibition with EGFR/HER-2 and ADAM Protease Inhibitors

Animal Studies
Animals. Female athymic mice (CD-1 nu/nu, 8–12 wk old) were obtained
from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Animals were housed in a barrier
facility fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care, International. All of the procedures were
conducted in accordance with the USPHS Policy on Humane Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and with Incyte Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines.
Efficacy study. When mice were 7 to 8 wk old, each mouse was
inoculated with 1  107 BT-474 cells in 0.2 mL of medium s.c. The
treatments were started when the tumor size reached f200 mm3.
INCB007839 was dosed with mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet) implanted s.c.
and lapatinib was administered orally twice daily. Lapatinib was
administered by oral gavage to ensure that the animals received the
compound. Tumor sizes were measured twice weekly in two dimensions
using a caliper, and the volume is presented in mm3 using the formula:
V = 0.5a  b 2, where a and b are the long and short diameters of the tumor,
respectively. Tumor growth delay was measured as time (days) for the
treated group to reach an arbitrary tumor size of 1,000 mm3. Responses
were designated as complete remission when tumor volume decreased in

size to the point of being undetectable (<3 mm  3 mm) and as partial
remission when tumor volume decreased to <50% of its starting volume.

Results
Combination of a sheddase inhibitor and a dual EGFR/HER2/neu tyrosine kinase inhibitor on the in vitro growth of
human breast cancer cells. Because overexpression of HER-2/neu
confers poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy and
hormonal therapy, and because sheddase inhibitors interfere with
the cleavage of the HER-2/neu receptor, we chose to examine the
effects of the sheddase inhibitor in combination with the dual
EGFR/HER-2/neu inhibitor on the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell
line (low HER-2/neu expression) and the HER-2/neu–transfected
MCF-7 cell line (MCF/18). Using both cell lines enabled us to
determine if the sheddase inhibitor alone or in combination had
a differential effect depending on HER-2/neu expression. The
addition of the lapatinib-like dual EGFR/HER-2/neu inhibitor
(GW2974; 0.5–1 Amol/L) to MCF-7 and HER-2/neu–transfected

MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (MCF/18) resulted in dosedependent growth inhibition (15–47% and 33–48% inhibition,
respectively). INCB3619 is a potent sheddase inhibitor of ADAM10
and ADAM17 (Fig. 1). Exposure to INCB3619 alone at concentrations of 10 to 30 Amol/L resulted in minimal growth inhibition
in the MCF-7 and MCF/18 cell lines (21% and 0–14%, respectively).
Exposure to the combination of GW2974 and INCB3619 resulted in
synergistic growth inhibition in the MCF-7 and HER-2/neu–
overexpressing MCF/18 cells (Fig. 2) as confirmed by isobologram
analysis (Table 1). Sequencing INCB3619 and GW2974 dosages
(either agent given 6 hours, 24 hours, or 3 days before exposure to
the other agent) did not increase the synergy beyond what was
observed when the agents were added simultaneously (data not
shown).
The combination was tested further on the MCF/18 cells at
lower concentrations of INCB3619 (0.25–10 Amol/L). At these
doses, INCB3619 did not produce growth inhibition as a single
agent. When this low dose was combined with GW2974, synergism
of growth inhibition was again observed (data not shown).
Combination of a sheddase inhibitor and a dual EGFR/HER2/neu tyrosine kinase inhibitor on the in vitro signaling of
human breast cancer cells. Because we could show that
INCB3619 and GW2974 showed synergistic growth inhibition of
MCF/18 cells, we examined their effects alone and in combination
on several signaling pathways, including ERK, AKT, and HER-3.
MCF/18 cells were treated with the compounds for 3 days as
described above. INCB3619 is stable for at least 3 days with no
evidence of breakdown under these cell culture conditions (data
not shown). Cell extracts were then prepared and analyzed by
Western blot for levels of phosphorylated ERK, AKT, and HER-3.
As shown in Fig. 3, INCB3619, when tested alone, showed no
significant inhibition of signaling at the concentrations tested
whereas GW2974 treatment resulted in a partial decrease in the
phosphorylated levels of all three proteins. However, exposure to
the combination of GW2974 and INCB3619 resulted in a marked
decrease in the levels of phosphorylated ERK, AKT, and HER-3

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

beyond what occurred following treatment with GW2974 alone. No
effects of compound treatment on total protein levels were
observed. Similar effects on ERK, AKT, and HER-3 signaling were
also observed in BT-474 cells exposed to INCB3619 and lapatinib
(data not shown).
Effects of INCB3619 on in vitro HER-2/neu and amphiregulin shedding. To assess whether the INCB3619 sheddase
inhibitor has a direct effect on cleavage of the HER-2/neu receptor,
the quantity of HER-2/neu shed from breast cancer cells after
exposure to the sheddase inhibitor was measured. Supernatant from
HER-2/neu–overexpressing MCF/18 cells exposed to 10 Amol/L
INCB3619 for 24 hours or 3 days was collected and tested in a HER-2/
neu–specific ELISA for quantitation of HER-2/neu protein (ng/mL).
At 24 hours, there was no reduction in the percentage of HER-2
shedding from cells exposed to 10 Amol/L of INCB3619 compared
with cells exposed to DMSO (control). At 3 days, a 41% reduction in
HER-2/neu shedding was observed. Increasing the dose of INCB3619
to 25 Amol/L did not result in a greater reduction in HER-2/neu
shedding (Fig. 4A) after 3 days of exposure.
Because we had previously shown that INCB3619 could inhibit
EGFR ligand shedding in a non–small cell lung cell line (1), we also
examined the effects of the compound on EGFR ligand shedding in
the MCF-7 breast cell line. In agreement with previous reports,
MCF7 cells were shown to shed the EGFR ligand, amphiregulin,
into the medium following PMA stimulation (Fig. 4B). Treatment of
cells with various concentrations of INCB3619 dose dependently
blocked amphiregulin shedding with >80% inhibition observed at
the 10 Amol/L concentration. Therefore, consistent with what has
been observed in other cell lines, INCB3619 can reduce shedding of
both HER2/neu and EGFR ligands in the MCF7 cell system.
These effects of INCB3619 on soluble ligand and receptor levels
seem to result from sheddase inhibition rather than to a change in
cell number in the assay systems used due to compound toxicity.
Amphiregulin shedding was measured in a 2-hour assay in
which any change in cell number would not be expected. For the

HER-2/neu shedding experiments, cells were exposed to 10 Amol/L
of INCB3619, a dose shown above not to affect cell number in
HER-2/neu–transfected MCF-7 cells. It should also be noted
that although the HER-2/neu ELISA measures full-length receptor
(185 kDa) as well as the ectodomain (f105 kDa) in cell
supernatants, any contribution of full-length HER-2/neu being
released from toxicity-induced cell lysis would, if anything, increase
the total HER-2/neu measured, masking the reduction of cleaved
HER-2/neu observed with INCB3619 and resulting in an underestimate of the effects of the compound. In addition, we confirmed
by Western blot analysis in BT-474 cells that INCB3619 only blocks
release of the cleaved form of HER-2/neu (data not shown).

human breast cancer xenografts were established as described in
Materials and Methods. We chose this cell line for the in vivo

experiments because it is easily established in animal models, it is a
HER-2/neu–positive cell line, and, as noted earlier, HER-3 and
other downstream proteins are affected in a manner similar to that
observed in the HER-2/neu–transfected MCF-7 cells. Because the
clinical candidate ADAM protease inhibitor, INCB7839, has better
pharmacokinetics than INCB3619 (data not shown) and because
they have identical specificity profiles and behave identically in
multiple in vitro systems, we chose to use INCB7839 for our in vivo
assays. Lapatinib was used at a dose shown to block HER-2/neu
phosphorylation but below the maximum tolerated dose. INCB7839
was administered at a dose capable of achieving steady-state levels
of 500 nmol/L to 1 Amol/L in plasma. This concentration was
previously determined to be above the IC50 for HER-2/neu and
EGFR ligand shedding. Treatment with (a) the INCB7839 sheddase
inhibitor or (b) lapatinib alone resulted in a decrease in mean
tumor volume compared with animals treated with the vehicle.
Treatment with the combination of INCB7839 and lapatinib,
however, resulted in complete prevention of the increase in mean
tumor volume (Fig. 5). Together, these results suggest that

combination of a sheddase inhibitor with a dual EGFR/HER-2 TKI
can synergistically inhibit the growth of HER-2–expressing tumors
both in vitro and in vivo.

Discussion
The ErbB family of proteins has become a target of particular
interest due to its importance in the proliferation and survival of
human tumors. Many human tumors overexpress EGFR and/or
HER-2/neu (3, 26), which correlates with more aggressive tumors,
poor prognosis, and resistance to therapy.
ErbB inhibitors either in the form of antibodies to the receptors or
small-molecule inhibitors that block receptor tyrosine kinase activity
have become established treatments for several solid tumors. For the
ErbB receptors and their ligands to trigger the cascade of events
leading to downstream growth and survival pathway signaling, the
soluble form of the ligand must be available or the receptor must be
constitutively active (3, 17). Both of these requirements are achieved
through cleavage of the ErbB ligands or receptors.
The ADAM family of proteins (sheddases) is involved in the
cleavage of the ErbB ligands and receptors. ADAM17 has been
suggested to be the major ErbB ligand sheddase and is required for
EGFR signaling (1). A correlation has been reported between ADAM17
overexpression and EGFR activation in human breast cancers (1, 23).
ADAM10 is believed to be an important sheddase responsible for EGF
and HER-2/neu cleavage (1, 3, 21). Sheddase inhibitors are smallmolecule inhibitors of ADAM proteases that prevent ErbB ligand and
receptor cleavage. INCB3619, a potent inhibitor of ADAM10 and
ADAM17, potentiates the effect of subsaturating concentrations of
trastuzumab (Herceptin) on in vitro cell growth, as well as ERK and
Akt phosphorylation (3). In addition, it inhibits gefitinib (Iressa)–
resistant HER3 signaling and enhances gefitinib inhibition of EGFR
signaling in non–small cell lung cancer (1).
In this study, exposure to 10 Amol/L INCB3619 reduced HER-2/
neu shedding in HER-2/neu–transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells
in vitro by 41% and reduced amphiregulin shedding in MCF-7 cells
by >80%. Increasing the dose to 25 Amol/L did not further decrease
HER-2/neu shedding. This finding confirms that INCB3619
interferes with the cleavage of both the HER-2/neu receptor and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

EGFR ligands. It has previously been reported that INCB3619
inhibits HER-2/neu shedding from cell lines like BT-474, which
endogenously express the receptor, with a potency of f25 nmol/L
(18). The higher amount of compound required to inhibit HER-2/
neu shedding reported here may result from MCF18 cells being a
HER-2/neu–transfected cell line. It is possible that additional
enzymes may be involved in the processing of transfected proteins
that are not normally responsible for the shedding of endogenous
protein.
Functionally, the combination of a sheddase inhibitor (INCB3619)
and a lapatinib-like compound (GW2974) resulted in synergistic
growth inhibition in both MCF-7 and HER-2/neu–transfected MCF7 breast cancer cells in vitro. Synergy was observed at the lowest
doses of INCB3619 tested (250 nmol/L–10 Amol/L). The combination of INCB3619 and GW2974 also resulted in decreased levels of
phosphorylated ERK, AKT, and HER-3, signaling pathways known to
be important for tumor cell growth. In addition, the combination of
a sheddase inhibitor with a dual EGFR/HER-2/neu–targeted
therapy (lapatinib) resulted in complete growth inhibition in a
BT474-SC1 human breast cancer xenograft model. This observation
confirms Liu’s finding in the same xenograft model that INCB3619
potentiates the effect of subsaturating concentrations of trastuzumab (Herceptin) on cell growth (18). In combination with
trastuzumab, it also augments the proapoptotic and antiproliferative in vitro effects of paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic taxane, in
HER-2/neu–overexpressing breast cancer cells (18).
A possible explanation for these results is that addition of a
sheddase inhibitor to another HER-2/neu–targeted therapy may
result in more complete inhibition of the HER-2/neu pathway than
either alone. A second possible reason for the ability of a sheddase
inhibitor to potentiate the effects of other HER-2/neu inhibitors is
because of its ability to affect all members of the ErbB family,
including HER3. The PI3K/Akt pathway is driven primarily through
transphosphorylation of the kinase-inactive HER3 (27–29). HER3
signaling persists despite continued HER family–targeted therapy
and suppression of EGFR and HER-2/neu (27). This resistance to
HER3 signaling and subsequent PI3K/Akt effects on tumor growth
and survival may explain resistance to therapies like trastuzumab
(Herceptin), gefitinib, and lapatinib. It has already been reported
that INCB3619 inhibits gefitinib-resistant HER3 signaling in non–
small cell lung cancer (1).
In summary, sheddase inhibition prevents the cleavage of EGFR
ligands and HER-2/neu receptors, thereby preventing availability of
the ligand and receptors for activation of the ligand/receptor
complexes and subsequent activity of downstream growth and
survival pathways. Addition of a sheddase inhibitor to lapatinib or
Herceptin results in synergistic antitumor activity and should be
explored as a possible therapeutic approach to enhancing current
ErbB-targeted therapies.
