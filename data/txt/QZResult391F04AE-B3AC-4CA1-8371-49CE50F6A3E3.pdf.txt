BACKGROUND: The treatment for prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure after local therapy remains controversial. Peripheral androgen blockade using a combination of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and an antiandrogen may allow control of the prostatespecific antigen (PSA). Because testosterone levels are not suppressed, this approach may be associated with less morbidity than
conventional gonadal androgen suppression. METHODS: All patients had undergone previous definitive local therapy and had evidence of a rising PSA >1ng/mL, with no evidence of recurrent disease. Patients received both finasteride, 5 mg orally per day, and flutamide, 250 mg orally 3 a day. Patients were followed for a PSA response and quality of life assessment. RESULTS: Ninety-nine of
101 accrued patients were eligible. A 80% PSA decline was seen in 96 (96%) patients. The median time to PSA progression was 85
months. With a median follow-up of 10 years, the median survival time had not been reached, and the 5-year overall survival rate was
87%. Toxicity was mild, with 18 patients stopping for toxicity; 15 had diarrhea, 4 had gynecomastia, and 3 had transaminase elevation.
Baseline Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate Module and Treatment Outcome Index scores decreased by 5 points
each at 6 months after enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the finasteride/flutamide combination is feasible, and results in
PSA declines of 80% in 96% of patients with serologic progression after definitive local therapy. There were no unexpected toxicities, and the change in quality of life was mild. Further evaluation of this or a similar regimen in a controlled clinical trial is warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 1 in 3 men treated for clinically localized prostate cancer will develop recurrent disease, most commonly
demonstrating a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA), termed serologic progression.1,2 The treatment of such early recurrences remains controversial. Several salvage local therapies, such as radical prostatectomy for radiation therapy failures,3
salvage radiotherapy for surgery failures,4 and the use of other local therapeutic approaches such as cryotherapy5 have been
used in selected patient populations. Another common approach is the use of systemic therapy. The most active systemic
therapy, with a response rate of >90%,6 is testosterone-lowering treatments, termed androgen deprivation therapy

(ADT). However, such therapy may have a myriad of side
effects, such as hot flashes, loss of muscle and bone mass,
depression, mood swings, loss of mental acuity, and
decreased libido.7 More recently, the potential adverse
effect on glucose homeostasis and cardiac events have
been raised as concerns.8,9 Furthermore, the survival benefit of such therapy remains unproven.6 Because patients
with PSA only recurrences after definitive local therapy
are not necessarily destined to die of their disease, they are
excellent candidates for therapy that may have lower toxicity, while retaining the potential to control their disease.
Alternatives to gonadal androgen ablation have been
investigated. Some therapies, such as 5-alpha reductase
inhibitors, may affect prostate cancer cells by blocking the
conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, thereby
lowering dihydrotestosterone levels in the cells.10
Currently available 5-alpha reductase inhibitors include
finasteride, which inhibits only 1 isoenzyme, or dutasteride; this inhibits both of the 2 isoenzymes that humans
possess to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.
Finasteride monotherapy has been shown to have some
activity in the prevention of prostate cancer,11,12 but
appears to be inactive in treating metastatic disease.13 Its
role in prostate cancer patients with serologic progression
is unproven.
Antiandrogens are a class of drugs that bind the
androgen receptor, thereby inhibiting its activation by
androgens. Drugs of this class include flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide. Bicalutamide has been studied
in the adjuvant setting after local therapy, where its use
delayed time to PSA recurrence, but had no impact on
overall survival.14 As monotherapy in the metastatic
setting, these agents are inferior to ADT.15 However,
several pilot trials have shown that the addition of
antiandrogens to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (termed
peripheral androgen blockade because systemic testosterone levels are not lowered) may have useful activity in
the control of prostate cancer.16-18 Furthermore, these
pilot trials suggested that peripheral androgen blockade
is well tolerated and potentially less morbid than ADT.
On the basis of these data, beginning in 1998, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) undertook a
phase 2 study of the finasteride/flutamide combination
as peripheral androgen blockade in patients with serologic progression after definitive local therapy, with the
intent of evaluating an approach for this group of
patients that was potentially better tolerated than ADT.
At the time this study was designed, the only 5-alphareductase inhibitor available was finasteride, and the
4140

finasteride/bicalutamide combination had not yet been
tested. Although launched in 1998, this study has not
been previously reported because of the long-term
survival of these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The study population consisted of patients with localized
prostate cancer treated with either a radical prostatectomy
or external beam radiation therapy. This treatment had to
be completed at least 1 year but not >10 years before
enrollment. No more than 6 months of any hormonal
therapy could have been received as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Patients had to have a PSA level of 1 ng/
mL, but 10 ng/mL, with evidence of a rise of at least 1
ng/mL above their nadir, confirmed by at least 1 additional PSA level at least 1 week later. At the time this study
was launched, there was little appreciation of the prognostic value of PSA doubling time, so this pretreatment variable was not assessed. No patient could have had
hormonal therapy within 12 months of registration, and
in particular no 5a-reductase inhibitor therapy within
2 years of protocol treatment was permitted. Patients
could not be on corticosteroids above standard replacement doses and could not have undergone an orchiectomy, and no previous cytotoxic chemotherapy for
prostate cancer was allowed. Patients were required to
have a computed tomography scan of the abdomen and
pelvis and a bone scan showing no evidence of metastatic
disease and no evidence of recurrent or persistent local
disease on digital rectal exam. An Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2
was required. Finally, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
creatinine, and bilirubin 2 the upper limits of normal
were also required at trial entry.
Study Design

The study was approved by the Executive Committee of
the CALGB, and by the institutional review boards of
each participating site. All patients provided written,
informed consent. Therapy consisted of a combination of
finasteride at 5 mg orally daily and flutamide 250 mg
orally 3 a day. Blood tests to monitor liver function,
PSA, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were obtained once per month for the
first 3 months, then every 3 months for 3 visits, and every
6 months thereafter. Toxicity was assessed at these time
points and graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria version 2. Progression was defined as the development

of metastatic disease on scan, recurrence of local disease
on scan or physical exam, or PSA progression. Dose
adjustments required by the study included removal of
patients from study treatment for grade 2 elevation of
AST or ALT. Grade 2 diarrhea resulted in a decrease
of flutamide to half dose (125 mg orally 3 per day), with
discontinuation of the flutamide if there was a recurrence
of grade 2 diarrhea on reduced doses. To prevent gynecomastia, prophylactic breast irradiation was encouraged,
but not mandated.
After progressive disease was noted, flutamide was
discontinued, and patients remained on finasteride, to
monitor for a potential antiandrogen withdrawal
response. After further progression on finasteride monotherapy, treatment with combined androgen blockade,
consisting of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
(LHRH) agonist and either bicalutamide or nilutamide,
was undertaken.
Quality of Life

Quality of life (QOL) was measured primarily by using
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate
Module (FACT-P) instrument.19 This was supplemented
with additional questions focusing specifically on sexual
functioning adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study
Sexual Problems Scale.20 Patients completed the questionnaire at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.
Endpoints

This trial was designed before the development of consensus criteria by the PSA Working Group. In this trial, a
response was defined as a PSA decline of 80%. Because
patients had no evidence of metastatic disease on study
entry, routine follow-up scans were not required, but
documentation of metastatic disease on scans obtained
for cause was considered to meet criteria for progression.
Progression by PSA criteria was defined in the protocol as
a rise of 4 ng/mL or 50% above the nadir, whichever
was greater. The nadir was considered the lowest PSA level
while on protocol therapy. An elevated confirmatory PSA
at least 1 week later was also required for progression.
Statistical Design and Data Analysis

The primary endpoint of this study was time to PSA progression. Sample size computation was based on the primary endpoint. The null hypothesis was that the median
time to PSA progression was 18 months, with the
alternative hypothesis being that the median time to PSA
failure would be 26 months.
The target sample size was 100 patients. The normal
approximation to the exact exponential test was used for
sample size computation, and the following assumptions

were made: a 2-sided type I error rate ¼ 0.05, power of at
least 80%, an accrual rate of 4 patients/month over a 24month accrual period, an 18-month follow-up period,
and the time to PSA progression following an exponential
distribution.
At the time the protocol for this study was written,
very little was known about the natural history of patients
experiencing biochemical failure after local therapy for
prostate cancer. The present study represents 1 of the first
cooperative group studies in this disease state. A median
time to progression of 18 months was assumed based on
the PFS results of SWOG 8894, a study of bilateral orchiectomy with or without flutamide in patients with
untreated metastatic prostate cancer.21 In retrospect, these
calculations should have been based on the subset with
minimal disease, which still represented a more advanced
disease group than the men in our study.
The primary interest in the QOL analysis was the
change in the total score of the FACT-P between baseline
and month 6 during treatment with the combination of
finasteride and flutamide. In particular, the study was
designed to detect a small to medium change in the
FACT-P at month 6 relative to baseline, specifically a
standardized mean change of 0.34, at the .05 level of significance (2-tailed) with 80% power. This change was
prospectively defined as reflecting a small to medium
change.
The Kaplan-Meier product-limit approach was used
to estimate the time to PSA progression, prostate cancerspecific survival, time to metastases, and overall survival
time distributions. Prostate cancer-specific survival was
defined as the time interval between study entry and the
time of death from prostate cancer. Overall survival was
defined as the time interval between study entry and date
of death from any cause. Time to metastases was defined
as the interval between study entry and date of initial
metastases. Metastatic disease was defined as recurrence
on exam, scan, or biopsy. Descriptive statistics were used
to summarize the toxicity data.
The change of QOL measures over time against
baseline was evaluated using a generalized linear model
with the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method.
The empirical variance estimates from the GEE analysis
take the correlation of multiple measures of QOL scales
over time into account and form the basis of testing the
change of QOL measures after receiving treatment. In the
GEE analyses, only patients who provided all 3 QOL
assessments are included. Assessment time is the only
covariate included in modeling, and an unspecified correlation structure is chosen. For continuous scores of the

Patient registration and data collection were
managed by the CALGB Statistical Center. Data quality
was ensured by careful review of data by CALGB Statistical Center staff and by the study chairperson. Statistical
analyses were performed by CALGB statisticians. As part
of the quality assurance program of the CALGB, members
of the Audit Committee visit all participating institutions
at least once every 3 years to review source documents.
The auditors verify compliance with federal regulations
and protocol requirements, including those pertaining to
eligibility, treatment, adverse events, tumor response, and
outcome in a sample of protocols at each institution. Such
on-site review of medical records was performed for 49 of
the 101 (49%) patients enrolled in this study.
RESULTS
Patients

A total of 101 patients were enrolled onto this study from
October 1998 through July 2001. One patient was found
to be ineligible, and 1 patient never started protocol therapy. Long-term outcome results are based on the 99
patients treated. Patient demographic and clinical data are

summarized in Table 1. The enrollment data indicate a
typical group of patients who developed an elevated PSA
after local therapy for this time period. Sixty-six percent of
the patients had undergone primary therapy consisting of
radical prostatectomy, whereas 71% had received prior
radiotherapy, mostly as secondary or salvage therapy.
Median PSA at time of enrollment was 3.8 (range, 1.09.9). These patients were largely asymptomatic, with only
10% taking an analgesic for any reason. Their performance status was high, with 76% being ECOG 0, and their
laboratory parameters such as hemoglobin (median, 14.7
g/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (median, 72.5 IU/L)
reflected their low systemic tumor burden. Gleason score
was assessed locally; 78% of patients had a Gleason score
of 7. Per eligibility criteria, no patient had evidence of
metastatic disease or grossly apparent locally recurrent or
persistent disease.
Clinical Outcomes

Nearly all patients met the predefined criteria for a PSA
response, with a decline in PSA level of 80% observed

declines of 77%, 73%, and 38%, which were not confirmed. Seventy-three percent of enrolled patients
achieved an undetectable PSA value (<0.2 ng/mL).

nadir value was 3.2 months. The median PSA progression-free survival was 85 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 70-106), and the 5-year PSA progression-free
survival rate was 65% (Fig. 1, Top). With 10 years of follow-up, the median survival time had not been reached,
and the 5-year overall survival rate was 87% (Fig. 1,

Bottom). The 5-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate
was 95.7% (95% CI, 89.0-98.4). The 5-year metastasisfree rate was 97.5 % (95% CI, 90.2-99.4).
An exploratory analysis based on baseline Gleason
score was performed. The median time to PSA progression or death for patients with baseline Gleason sum 8 to
10 was 67 months (95% CI, 32-86), compared with
104 months (95% CI, 70-119) for patients with Gleason
sum <8.
Patient Disposition

Patient disposition is summarized in Figure 2. Of 99 eligible patients, 22 remain on therapy. Of the 77 patients off
protocol treatment, 43 patients have died. Of these, 13
deaths were attributed to progressive prostate cancer.
Other causes of death included 5 patients (12% of all
deaths and 5% of all patients) who experienced cardiac
events or events that were potentially cardiac in nature
while on protocol treatment. This included 2 patients
with congestive heart failure and/or ischemia, 1 with
cardiopulmonary arrest, 1 with cardiac symptoms in the
setting of pneumonia, and 1 with sudden death. Two
patients developed myelodysplasia. One patient each died
from metastatic lung and colon cancer, which were diagnosed after starting therapy. Other causes of death
included Alzheimer disease, respiratory distress, stroke,
and an accidental fall. Seventeen patients had unknown
causes of death.
Reasons for removal from protocol therapy include
toxicity (18 patients), progressive disease (21 patients),
and withdrawal of consent (9 patients). The major toxicities that led to patient removal from treatment (vide
infra) include toxicities that were expected, such as
diarrhea, elevation of liver enzymes, and gynecomastia.
Response to Subsequent Hormonal Therapy

At the time of protocol-defined progression, patients
underwent flutamide withdrawal, and upon further progression were placed on combined androgen blockade
(CAB) with an LHRH agonist and a different antiandrogen than flutamide. Outcome data from these maneuvers
were incomplete because of 22 patients remaining on their
original treatment and several other patients being taken
off trial before progression. However, of the 21 patients to
date who have been taken off flutamide because of progression, 2 (14%) had a withdrawal response, as measured
by a 50% decrease in serum PSA. Nineteen of 27
patients (70%) subsequently treated with CAB sustained
a PSA response of 50%. Six men received CAB without
waiting for a flutamide withdrawal response. The

DISCUSSION
The appropriate therapy for patients with serologic progression after definitive local therapy remains unknown.
Local salvage therapy clearly has a role in selected patients.
Recently, the PSA doubling time (PSADT) has been used
as a means to distinguish between patients who might
benefit from additional local therapy versus those who
might benefit from systemic therapy.23,24 ADT has been
widely used in patients with serologic progression, but
appears to be associated with toxicities with long-term
use, and has not been shown to prolong survival. It was in
this context that CALGB 9782 was launched, as a means
of evaluating a regimen with the potential for efficacy, but
diminished toxicity.
This trial of peripheral androgen blockade has demonstrated that this approach is feasible, active, and durable. Although the entry criteria developed for this trial
predated an understanding of the important prognostic
importance of PSADT, this was nevertheless a carefully
defined group, with PSA values between 1 and 10 ng/mL,
no evidence of metastatic disease, and very limited prior
hormonal exposure. This group of patients experienced

Overall, QOL as measured by the FACT-P

Index (P < .0001). Cella et al22 demonstrated that 5- to
7-point changes on the total FACT scores and Treatment
Outcome Index scores are clinically meaningful. By this
criterion, clinically meaningful changes were seen on the
total FACT-P and the Treatment Outcome Index scores.
Examination of the sexual functioning items revealed significant improvements over time in the ability to relax
and enjoy sexual activity (Table 3; P ¼ .0255) and to
become sexually aroused (Table 3; P ¼ .0005).

declines in PSA of 80% in 96% of the patients, with
73% of such patients developing an undetectable PSA,
defined as values <0.2 ng/mL. Furthermore, these
patients had a rapid decline in their PSA levels, reaching
nadir values at a median time of 3.2 months. Although
direct comparisons with historical data related to ADT are
problematic, and the correlation of survival with PSA
declines because of hormone therapy remains to be proven
for this group of patients, the initial PSA declines in
response to peripheral androgen blockade in these patients
compares favorably with other reported hormonal
maneuvers.21,25
The PSA declines observed appeared to be durable,
with only 21 of 97 eligible patients (22%) having progressed through this therapy at a median follow-up of
10 years. The survival of this group of patients appears
robust, with 87% alive after 5 years, and median survival
not reached at 10 years of follow-up. However, the true
impact of this therapy cannot be ascertained, because a
significant proportion of men with serologic progression
will not necessarily die from prostate cancer.26
Interestingly, after progression, the majority of
patients responded to additional hormonal maneuvers.
Although the exact response proportion to antiandrogen
withdrawal (AAWD) in the absence of ongoing gonadal
androgen ablation has not been carefully tested, it is of interest to note that an AAWD response was seen in 14% of
the patients in the current study, which is comparable to
the response rate reported with AAWD in patients simultaneously treated with orchiectomy or an LHRH agonist
and an antiandrogen.27-30 Furthermore, 70% of patients
treated with salvage LHRH agonist therapy had subsequent PSA responses, suggesting that initial response to
peripheral androgen blockade may not compromise
subsequent sensitivity to ADT. The durability of these
subsequent PSA declines after salvage gonadal ablation is
not known.
Importantly, the apparent disease control achieved
with this regimen was not at the expense of significant
toxicity. Overall, this regimen was extremely well tolerated. As expected, some gastrointestinal toxicity was seen,
which was attributed to flutamide. Fifteen patients developed diarrhea, which led to dose reductions or removal
from protocol therapy. Three patients had transaminase
elevation sufficient to stop therapy. Nearly half of the
patients developed grade 1 or 2 gynecomastia or breast
tenderness. This led to the withdrawal of consent in 4
patients. Although further follow-up is required, 5 potential cardiac deaths have been observed in 99 patients (5%)
while on treatment, with no clear treatment-associated

cardiac events noted. Although the exact incidence and
relationship of cardiac events with ADT continues to be
debated, it was reassuring that relatively few cardiac events
were observed.
One of the potential advantages of peripheral androgen blockade is the ability to preserve potency. Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients enrolled in this study
rated their ability to have or maintain an erection as poor
at baseline. Perhaps this is attributable to the median age
of 71 years as well as the relative lack of potency-sparing
local therapeutic approaches being undertaken at the time
most of these patients were treated. Therefore, preservation of potency could not be reliably measured.
The decrease in QOL at the 6-month assessment
appears to be driven by changes in physical and functional well-being. Importantly, no significant changes
were seen in emotional or social family well-being.
Interestingly, patients reported improvement in the
ability to relax and enjoy sexual activity and to become
sexually aroused. As a group, the men rated their ability
to have or maintain an erection as poor at baseline;
therefore, it is not surprising that no improvement during therapy was seen in the ability to have or maintain
an erection. This pattern suggests that the men were
able to find alternate ways of enjoying sexual intimacy
with their partners. An important question for future
research is to determine whether men who have no or
minimal erectile dysfunction before treatment would be
able to maintain erectile function with peripheral androgen blockade.
In summary, peripheral androgen blockade with
flutamide and finasteride has activity and minimal toxicity
in prostate cancer patients with serologic progression.
Although the patients enrolled on this trial appeared to
have outstanding and durable control of their cancer,
while avoiding the toxicity and expense of ADT, this trial
was noncomparative, and therefore it is difficult to be sure
of the effectiveness of such therapy without a control
group. Other treatment options for patients who qualified
for this protocol include ADT with gonadal androgen
ablation, as well as close observation. The results of a
randomized trial of intermittent androgen suppression
compared with continuous androgen suppression in
nearly the same population of men recently described similar survival rates between the 2 groups.31 The men in the
intermittent arm, of whom 35% fully recovered their testosterone, reported higher QOL scores. The largest
reported analysis of observation of men with biochemical
recurrence after prostatectomy was recently updated.32

any additional therapies after surgery reported a median
metastasis-free survival (MFS) of 10 years. Their 5-year
MFS of 67% compares to our 5-year 97% metastasis-free
rate. Future studies in this group of men will benefit from
further defining those with low-, intermediate-, and highrisk disease using contemporary risk calculations and
perhaps yet to be defined biomarkers. With this in mind,
further evaluation of the combination of flutamide and
finasteride or a similar regimen in a controlled clinical
trial is warranted.
