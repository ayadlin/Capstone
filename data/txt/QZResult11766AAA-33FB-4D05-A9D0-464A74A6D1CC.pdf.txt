ABSTRACT
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease, in which the lining of the colon
becomes inflamed and develops ulcers leading to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal
bleeding. The extent of these symptoms depends on disease severity. The protein
arginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes converts peptidyl-Arginine to peptidylCitrulline through citrullination. PADs are dysregulated, with abnormal citrullination
in many diseases, including UC and colorectal cancer (CRC). We have developed the
small molecule, pan-PAD inhibitor, Chlor-amidine (Cl-amidine), with multiple goals,
including treating UC and preventing CRC. Building off our recent results showing
that: 1) Cl-amidine suppresses colitis in vivo in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse
model; and 2) Cl-amidine induces microRNA (miR)-16 in vitro causing cell cycle arrest,
we tested the hypothesis that Cl-amidine can prevent tumorigenesis and that miR-16
induction, by Cl-amidine, may be involved in vivo. Consistent with our hypothesis,
we present evidence that Cl-amidine, delivered in the drinking water, prevents colon
tumorigenesis in our mouse model of colitis-associated CRC where mice are given
carcinogenic azoxymethane (AOM), followed by multiple cycles of 2% DSS to induce
colitis. To begin identifying mechanisms, we examined the effects of Cl-amidine on
miR-16. Results show miR-16 suppression during the colitis-to-cancer sequence in
colon epithelial cells, which was rescued by drinking Cl-amidine. Likewise, Ki67 and
cellular proliferation targets of miR-16 (Cyclins D1 and E1) were suppressed by Clamidine. The decrease in cell proliferation markers and increase in tumor suppressor
miRNA expression potentially define a mechanism of how Cl-amidine is suppressing
tumorigenesis in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

[1]. The probability of developing CRC increases yearly
once UC develops, with up to an approximate 20%
incidence after 30 years [1, 2]. Current treatment options
help to treat the symptoms, prevent flares, and heal the
damaged colon; however, the treatment outcomes are
often marginal, patients become refractory, and there are
dangerous adverse side effects. Therefore, we continue to
investigate novel therapies showing reduced toxicity and
more substantial efficacy in treating UC and preventing
CRC.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing
inflammatory bowel disease that affects millions of
people worldwide and causes symptoms of abdominal
pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Due to the chronic
inflammatory state of UC, which causes cyclical oxidative
stress and leads to DNA damage, patients with UC are
at a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC)

Tumor incidence (the number of mice per group with tumors) is shown alongside the percentage of mice with tumors.
The average number of tumors per mouse (tumor multiplicity) is shown and is also divided based on size (<1 mm and

in vitro [14-17]. Based on these precedents, we tested the
hypothesis that Cl-amidine can prevent tumorigenesis in
the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
mouse model of colitis-associated CRC. Mechanistic
insight is also gained by examining the levels of miRNA
changes during this process.

The protein arginine deiminase (PAD) family of
enzymes converts peptidyl-Arginine to peptidyl-Citrulline
through a process called ‘citrullination’ [3]. There are five
isozymes found in mammals (PAD1-4 and 6), with 7095% homology in their amino acid sequence [4]. The PAD
isozymes are encoded by a cluster of homologous genes
found on Chromosome 1 in humans [4, 5]. Citrullination
can affect protein-protein interactions, hydrogen bond
formation, and protein structure due to the shift from
the positively charged peptidyl-Arginine to the neutral
peptidyl-Citrulline [5]. At physiological activity levels,
PADs regulate many cell signaling pathways including
differentiation, apoptosis, and gene transcription [6].
However, over the past decade, it is becoming increasingly
apparent that aberrant PAD activity is involved in many
human inflammatory diseases such as: rheumatoid
arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis [3,
7-10]. Concerning our study, PADs, especially PAD4, are
found to be dysregulated in UC and CRC [11-14]. In UC
and other chronic inflammatory, autoimmune diseases, it
is thought that the accumulation of citrullinated proteins is
what leads to an abnormal immune response that further
exacerbates the inflammatory response [6].
We have developed a novel, small molecule
inhibitor of PADs, named N-α-benzoyl-N5-(2-chloro1-iminoethyl)-L-ornithine amide or Chlor-amidine (Clamidine). Cl-amidine prevents citrullination by covalently
modifying a conserved cysteine residue in the active site
of the PADs, causing irreversible inactivation of the
enzyme [6]. Cl-amidine is an excellent candidate drug
for our CRC prevention studies because it: 1) exhibits
little toxicity at doses we use here in vitro and in vivo; 2)
displays no immunosuppressive effects in multiple disease
models associated with PAD dysregulation; 3) effectively
suppresses colitis in mice when given by oral gavage; and
4) increases tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA) levels

RESULTS

AOM/DSS-induced

To ensure that 2% DSS was effectively causing
colitis in the treated mice, we determined the histology
score of four euthanized mice (per group) at day 35.
In Figure 1B, histology scores for ulceration and
inflammation indicate that the AOM + DSS only group
does have a significantly higher score than the AOM only
group. As expected at this time point, despite the varying
severity of colitis in the treatment groups, none of the mice
had developed tumors.
At day 70, mice were euthanized, and we recorded
the number mice with tumors (Table 1) and the average
number of tumors per mouse in each group (Figure 2A;
tumor multiplicity). We also measured the size of each
tumor (Table 1) and captured representative images
of the methylene blue stained colons (Figure 2B). No
tumors were found in the control AOM only mice and,
as predicted, the AOM + DSS only group (Group 2: 2.8
± 0.68 tumors/animal) had the highest tumor multiplicity.
Mice treated with Cl-amidine (Group 3: 0.07 ± 0.07
tumors/animal; Group 4: 0.67 ± 0.23 tumors/animal) had
significantly reduced tumor multiplicity than the AOM
+ DSS only group. Interestingly, there was a significant

difference in tumor multiplicity (p < 0.05) between the
Cl-amidine treated groups where the higher dosage group
(Group 4: 0.25 mg/mL Cl-amidine) had a higher tumor
multiplicity than the lower dosage group (Group 3: 0.05
mg/mL Cl-amidine). Although at this point we are unable
to explain this observation, perhaps a certain basal level
of citrullination is necessary to carry out functions, such
as apoptosis. Since the citrullination of proteins involved
in apoptosis (e.g. vimentin, nucleophosmin, nuclear lamin
C) facilitates the process of apoptosis [18-21], the higher
dose of Cl-amidine may be inhibiting the citrullination
necessary for the progression of apoptosis and aiding
in the development of tumors, thus accounting for the
increased tumor incidence. Nevertheless, the overall
results from this model show for the first time that Clamidine is capable of preventing tumorigenesis associated
with chronic colitis.

We have previously shown that Cl-amidine increases
miR-16 expression in a p53-dependent manner resulting
in a cell cycle arrest in vitro [17]. Since the inhibition
of cell proliferation is a goal of many anti-cancer drug
therapies, we hypothesized that Cl-amidine is preventing
tumorigenesis by increasing miR-16 expression in vivo.
To test this, we measured miR-16 expression levels in
isolated colon epithelial (CD45-) cells at day 35 (see
methods). We chose to investigate the miR-16 expression
levels at the day 35 time point because we were interested
in the mechanism preventing tumorigenesis at day 70.

in the epithelial cells. Consistent with our previously
published in vitro data [17] and our current hypothesis,
miR-16 expression in the AOM + DSS only group was
significantly lower than the AOM only group and both
Cl-amidine treated groups. Furthermore, the lower level
of miR-16 expression in epithelial cells from the higher
dosage group (0.25 mg/mL Cl-amidine), compared to the
lower dosage group (0.05 mg/mL Cl-amidine), is highly
suggestive of a direct correlation between the expression
level of miR-16 and tumor incidence; however, the cause
of this variability between Cl-amidine treatment groups is
currently unknown.

miR-16 has multiple cell proliferation targets, such
as Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1; supporting the premise that
it is a tumor suppressor miRNA [17, 22-25]. If miR16 expression is increased with Cl-amidine treatment
(Figure 3), then we expect to see the downregulation of
these cell proliferation targets of miR-16. Indeed, we
confirmed that protein expression of Cyclins D1 and E1
was suppressed in the Cl-amidine treated groups when
compared to the AOM + DSS only group (Figures 4A and
4B). To further verify the repression of cell proliferation
in the mice treated with Cl-amidine, we performed IHC
staining for the cell proliferation marker, Ki67, in colons

DISCUSSION
In this study, we provide evidence that Cl-amidine,
a small molecule inhibitor of PADs, administered to
mice in drinking water suppresses colitis (Figure 1)
and tumorigenesis (Figure 2; Table 1). To uncover the
mechanism by which Cl-amidine is acting, we revealed
that Cl-amidine increases miR-16 expression in colon
epithelial cells (Figure 3). Likewise, Cl-amidine treatment
decreases protein expression of the miR-16 targets,
Cyclins D1 and E1, and the cell proliferation marker,
Ki67 (Figure 4). Figure 5 depicts the unique mechanism
by which Cl-amidine prevents the tumorigenesis of CRC
in our mouse model.
PADs are calcium-dependent. Therefore, they are
usually inactive under physiological levels (10-8 to 10-6 M);
and only activating during certain events (i.e. apoptosis
and terminal epidermal differentiation) where calcium
levels are above physiological concentrations [5, 18].
Interestingly, and important to this study, patients with
active Crohn’s disease or UC have moderately higher
Ca2+ levels than healthy controls [26]. Not surprisingly,
then, citrullination (the post-translationally modified
product of active PADs) is elevated in colitis [27]. During
apoptosis and terminal epidermal differentiation, PADs are
found to citrullinate structural proteins, such as vimentin
and filaggrin, causing partial unfolding of the proteins
[5, 18]. The citrullination of these structural proteins
promotes the overall degradation of the cells during cell
death. PADs, specifically PAD4, have also been found
to regulate gene expression [28-33]. Many of the genes
that the PADs regulate are involved in the progression
of the p53 pathway, including ING4, p300, and HDAC2
[30-32]. With the involvement of PADs in pathways
that are crucial for proper cell growth and cell death, it
is readily apparent that aberrant PAD activity can lead to
deleterious consequences (e.g. abnormal DNA damage
repair response, protein misfolding, protein inactivation).
Additionally, citrullination controls the expression
of tumor suppressing miRNAs. miRNAs are regulators of
genes that control various cell signaling processes, such as
cell proliferation, apoptosis and stress response [34]. As
a result of an inflammatory response, such as that of UC,
miRNAs can be altered and expression levels can fluctuate
[35]. Although other miRNAs have been found associated
with either mouse or human UC, we focused here on
miR-16 because our previous in vitro data showed that
Cl-amidine induces miR-16 expression and decreases the
expression of several miR-16 targets (i.e. Cyclins D1, D2,
D3, E1, and CDK6) involved in the progression through
the cell cycle [17]. Likewise, miR-16 is found at lower
levels in CRC than in normal tissue [36]. One prospective
pathway through which Cl-amidine may be upregulating
miR-16 expression levels involves the tumor suppressor

Figure 5: Proposed mechanism of action for Clamidine preventing CRC. As evidenced in the results
produced in this manuscript, Cl-amidine upregulates miR-16
expression in mice through PAD inhibition. At this point, the
cell proliferation targets (Cyclin D1 and E1) of miR-16 are
downregulated, accounting for the decreased tumorigenesis
found at the endpoint of our study.

collected at day 35 (Figure 4C). In the colons collected
at day 35, the IRS of the AOM + DSS only groups were
significantly higher than the control AOM only groups
(Figure 4A-4C). For Cyclin D1 and Ki-67 stained colon
sections, the lower dose Cl-amidine group (0.05 mg/
mL) had a lower IRS than the AOM + DSS only group;
however, the group receiving 0.25 mg/mL Cl-amidine was
not significantly lower. Interestingly, the IRS values of
Cyclin D1 and Ki67 staining at day 35 revealed a similar
trend to the tumor incidence and miR-16 expression
levels in colon epithelial cells. For Cyclin E1 stained
colon sections, the groups treated with Cl-amidine both
had lower IRS values than the AOM + DSS only group,
but the lower dose Cl-amidine group (0.05 mg/mL) was
not significantly less. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that Cl-amidine is suppressing tumorigenesis
in our mouse model by inhibiting cell proliferation via

p53. p53 boosts the post-transcriptional maturation of
miR-16 and Cl-amidine is found to increase miR-16
expression in a p53-dependent manner in vitro [17, 37-39].
In summary, we have shown that Cl-amidine
suppresses colitis and, in this current study, suppresses
tumorigenesis in mice given Cl-amidine dosages in
drinking water [14]. Our current in vivo study is a
substantial extension of our previous mechanistic
in vitro data and suggests that increased miR-16
expression in mice treated with Cl-amidine results
in decreased tumor formation [17]. When miR-16
is downregulated, this relieves its inhibition of cell
proliferative targets, like Cyclin D1 and E1. Because our
results demonstrate that Cl-amidine can suppress these
targets of miR-16, this verifies the activity of miR-16
throughout our model. These findings display a significant
development in our knowledge of in vivo mechanisms
by which PAD inhibition can suppress colon cancer.
Future studies will explore the mechanism(s) by which
Cl-amidine is increasing miR-16 expression and will
determine optimum dosages for preventing tumorigenesis.
Overall, this study presents Cl-amidine as a viable cancer
preventative therapy against colitis-associated colorectal
cancer and provides an innovative mechanism of action
involving the upregulation of miR-16, ultimately
leading to decreased cell proliferation and prevention of
tumorigenesis in vivo.

0.05 mg/mL and 0.25 mg/mL Cl-amidine, respectively,
daily in the drinking water beginning at day 14 and ending
at day 70.
0.05 mg/mL and 0.25 mg/mL, which is the
equivalent of 10 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day per mouse,
respectively; or the human daily equivalent of 48.6 mg
and 243 mg, respectively. Calculations are as follows:
assuming an average mouse weighs 25 g and drinks
approximately 5 mL per day, then 0.25 mg / 25 g x 1000
g / 1 kg = 10 mg/kg daily. The human equivalent dose
(HED, mg/kg) = animal dose (mg/kg) x [Animal Km
/ Human Km] [41]. The HED (mg/kg) for mouse = 10
mg/kg x [3/37] = 0.81 mg/kg. Therefore, assuming an
adult human weighs approximately 60 kg on average,
the human equivalent is 0.81 mg/kg x 60 kg = 48.6 mg
daily. Using the same equations, the 0.25 mg/mL mouse
dosage is approximately the equivalent of 243 mg daily for
humans. We chose these doses because our previous work
has shown that 5 - 75 mg/kg/mouse per day was effective
in a dose-responsive manner at suppressing DSS-induced
colitis in mice [14]. Since 5 mg/kg/day was only modestly
effective, and 75 mg/kg/day is the Maximal Tolerable
Dose, we wanted to investigate the potency of multiple
doses within this range [14, 15]. Thus we chose 0.05
mg/mL and 0.25 mg/mL delivered in the drinking water.
We reasoned Cl-amidine would work better delivered in
the drinking water because Cl-amidine has a short halflife in vivo [15]. Therefore delivering the same amount
throughout the day over a long period of time (in water)
versus a bolus amount (oral gavage) would be a better
method with short-life compounds. We also determined
that Cl-amidine is stable in DSS-spiked water for 48
h (data not shown) and the mice drink approximately
the same amount of water daily regardless of treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1).
At day 35, after 1.5 cycles of DSS, 10 mice from
each group (1- 4) were euthanized to ensure that the DSS
was effective and for further analysis. Colons from each
mouse were removed, cut longitudinally, and washed with
1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The colons from four
mice from each group were Swiss-rolled, fixed in 10%
buffered formalin overnight, paraffin embedded, and then
sectioned for histopathology/immunohistochemistry. The
colons from the remaining six mice/group were incubated
in 10% fetal calf serum/5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)/Ca2+/Mg2+ free PBS for 15 min. Colons
were then shaken gently for 10 sec and the single cell
suspension, consisting of epithelial and inflammatory
cells, collected in the supernatant. Inflammatory cells were
separated from epithelial cells using CD45+ magnetic
microbeads that select for the inflammatory cells,
according to kit instructions (mouse CD45+ MicroBeads,
Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). These separated cells were
immediately processed for miRNA analysis to avoid any
breakdown of the RNA integrity.
At day 70, the remaining 15 mice from each of

mg/kg) was injected into each mouse via intraperitoneal

2-4 began cycles of 2% DSS (MP Biomedicals, Solon,
OH; m.w. 36 000 -50 000) given in the drinking water
for 70 days. Groups 2-4 were subjected to three cycles,
each consisting of one week with 2% DSS in the water
followed by two weeks of normal drinking water. The DSS
cycles were aimed to simulate the active inflammatory and
remission states of UC. Groups 3 and 4 were administered

the groups were euthanized. Colons were removed,
cut longitudinally, and washed with 1x PBS. Tumor
incidence and size were recorded for each colon. Colons
from each group were processed for histopathology/
immunohistochemistry in the same manner as the colons
harvested at day 35.

Paraffin-embedded sections of mouse colonic tissue
were incubated (4˚C) in Cyclin D1 (Rabbit monoclonal,
cat# TA307019, diluted 1:100, Origene, Rockville,
MD), Cyclin E1 (rabbit polyclonal, cat# TA311853,
diluted 1:1000, Origene, Rockville, MD), and anti-Ki67

Pierce, Rockford, IL) primary antibodies by slow rocking
overnight with Antibody Amplifier (ProHisto, Columbia,
SC) to ensure even and reproducible staining. Samples
were then processed using the EnVision+ System HRP kits
(DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) according to kit instructions.
The chromagen, diaminobenzidine, was added and
then the samples were counterstained with methyl
green. Stained tissues were objectively scored based on
two criteria: 1) percentage of tissue stained, and 2) the
staining intensity. The percentage of tissue stained was
scored on a scale of 0-5: 0 (0% positive staining), 1 ( <
10%), 2 (11-25%), 3 (26%-50%), 4 (51%-80%), or 5 ( >
80%). Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0-3: 0
(Negative staining), 1 (Weak), 2 (Moderate), or 3 (Strong).
Scores from each criteria were multiplied to get the final
immunoreactivity score (IRS).

Quantification of inflammation
Colons prepared for histopathology were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Sectioned H&E
stained samples were examined microscopically and
scored as previously described [14]. Briefly, the histology
score for a sample was determined by adding the scores
for inflammation severity, inflammation extent, and crypt
damage; then, multiplying by the score for percent area
involvement. The inflammation severity was scored
on a scale of 0-3: 0 (no inflammation), 1 (minimal), 2
(moderate), and 3 (severe). Inflammation extent was
scored on a scale of 0-3: 0 (no inflammation), 1 (mucosa
only), 2 (mucosa and submucosa), and 3 (transmural).
Crypt damage was scored on a scale of 0-4: 0 (no crypt
damage), 1 (one-third of crypt damaged), 2 (two-thirds
damaged), 3 (crypts lost and surface epithelium intact),
and 4 (crypts lost and surface epithelium lost). Percent
area involvement was scored on a scale of 0-4: 0 (0%
involvement), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), and
4 (76-100%). The minimum possible score is 0 and the
maximum possible score is 40.

Mean differences between groups were compared by
one-way ANOVA with Scheffe multiple comparison tests.
The p-value chosen for significance in this study was 0.05.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Total miRNA was extracted from separated
inflammatory (CD45+) and epithelial (CD45-) cells
according to miRNeasy Mini Kit instructions (Qiagen).
RNA concentration and stability were measured by
the Nanodrop 2000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). 10
ng of total RNA were used to make cDNA using the
TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to kit instructions.
We also used hsa-miRNA-16 primers for miR-16 detection
and small nuclear protein RNU6B (U6) for normalization
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative RealTime PCR to measure miR-16 and U6 was performed
using the TaqMan miRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) with the 7300 PCR Assay System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative fold
change (FC) of miR-16 expression, as compared to U6
expression, was determined based on the comparative
threshold cycles (Ct) of miR-16 and U6. All samples were
analyzed in triplicate.
