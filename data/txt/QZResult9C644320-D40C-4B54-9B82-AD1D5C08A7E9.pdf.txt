ABSTRACT
About 50–70% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive and
most of them are sensitive to endocrine therapy including tamoxifen. However, one
third of these patients will eventually develop resistance and relapse. We found that
the expression of miR-15a and miR-16 were significantly decreased in tamoxifen
resistant ER positive breast cancer cell lines. Exogenous expression of miR-15a/16
mimics re-sensitized resistant cells to tamoxifen by inhibiting Cyclin E1 and B cell
lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) to induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis respectively. Further,
we identified that a repressive member of E2F family, E2F7, was responsible for
the suppression of miR-15a/16 cluster by competing with E2F1 for E2F binding site
at the promoter of their host gene DLEU2. Moreover, high expression of E2F7 is
correlated with high risk of relapse and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients
receiving tamoxifen treatment. Together, our results suggest that overexpression
of E2F7 represses miR-15a/16 and then increases Cyclin E1 and Bcl-2 that result in
tamoxifen resistance. E2F7 may be a valuable prognostic marker and a therapeutic
target of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain
tamoxifen resistance, including loss of ERα expression [3]
and cross-talk between ER and receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling [4, 5]. Because of the complexity of tamoxifen
resistance, the underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood yet. Recent studies reported that abnormal
expression of miRNAs plays a role in tamoxifen resistance.
For instance, it was shown that up-regulated miR-221/222
induced tamoxifen resistance by targeting p27 [6];
miR-451 was responsible for resistance to tamoxifen
by targeting 14-3-3 zeta [7]; re-expression of miR-375
reversed both tamoxifen resistance and EMT phenotypes
[8]. MiR-15a/16 cluster, located at chromosomal region
13q14 and frequently deleted in cancer, are important

INTRODUCTION
Oestrogen signaling plays a central role in female
physiology through its effects on critical cellular
processes, including cell proliferation and survival.
ERα is the main receptor of oestrogen in breast tissues.
About 50-70% of breast cancer patients are classified as
ERα positive and interference with ERα signaling has
been an effective treatment strategy for over a century
[1]. Tamoxifen has been the most widely used endocrine
therapy in ERα positive breast cancer patients for more
than 30 years [2]. However, one-third of ERα tumors will
eventually develop resistance and relapse, presenting a
huge challenge for the cure of breast cancer.

miRNAs that act as tumor suppressors in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other malignancies
[9, 10]. It was reported that exogenous expression of
HER2∆16, a mutant form of HER2 in MCF7 cells,
suppressed miR-15a/16 and induced endocrine resistance
[11]. However, the mechanism is unclear and whether
miR-15a/16 have a role in the tamoxifen resistance of
HER2-negative ERα-positive cancers remains unknown.
The E2F family of transcription factors (E2F 1-8)
is known to regulate genes involved in cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis. E2F1-3 are known to be
transcription activators, while other family members,
including E2F7, are known as transcription repressors.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (CHIP-seq)
analysis revealed that E2F7 binds preferentially to the
genomic sites closely resemble the E2F consensus site
[12]. Some reports have linked abnormal expression
of E2F7 with cancer, for instance, increased E2F7
expression in cutaneous SCC [13] and its decreased
expression in ovarian cancer [14]. However, the link
between abnormal expression of E2F7 and breast cancer
remain unclear.
In the current study, we found that miR-15a/16
were down-regulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
cells. Exogenous expression of miR-15a/16 in tamoxifen
resistant cells induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by
inhibiting Cyclin E1 and Bcl-2. Further, we identified
that elevated E2F7 was responsible for transcriptional
repression of miR-15a/16 cluster in tamoxifen-resistant
breast cancer cells. Silencing E2F7 re-sensitizes breast
cancer cells to tamoxifen through up-regulation of miR15a/16. Finally, using several publicly available datasets,
we found that high E2F7 expression is associated with
higher relapse rate and poor prognosis of breast cancer
patients receiving tamoxifen treatment.

became MCF7-Resistant (MCF7-Re) and T47D resistant
(T47D-  Re) cells. To verify tamoxifen resistance of
MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cells, we performed MTT assay
to measure cell proliferation. The viability of MCF7-Re
and T47D-Re cells in the presence of 1 μM tamoxifen
was significantly higher than that of their Parental
cells (Figure 1A, Figure  S2A). Further, the induced
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of MCF7-Re cells under
1-4 μM tamoxifen were also significantly lower than
that of MCF7-Pa cells (Figures 1B, 1C). These data
demonstrated that the MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cell lines,
cultured by long time exposure to tamoxifen, acquired
resistance to tamoxifen.

Suppressed expression of miR-15a/16 causes
tamoxifen resistance of MCF7-Re and
T47D-Re cells
Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 3.0 microarray was
used to examine the miRNAs differentially expressed
between MCF7-Pa and MCF7-Re cells. With a cut-off
value of 2 fold increase or decrease, 18 miRNAs were
down-regulated and 15 were up-regulated (Table 1).
Down-regulated mature miRNAs were validated by
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Figure S1). To
identify the miRNAs that are responsible for tamoxifen
resistance, miRNA mimics of the 18 down-regulated
miRNAs were used for functional screening. The results
indicated that transfection of miR-15a (p < 0.001) and
miR-497 (p < 0.05) mimics re-sensitized MCF7-Re
cells to tamoxifen treatment (Figure 1D). Interestingly,
miR-15a and miR-497 belong to the miR-15a miRNA
family and have similar sequences. We further found
that most of the miR-15a family members, including
miR-497, miR-195, miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-15b,
were significantly down-regulated in MCF7-Re cells
(Figure  1E). Exogenous expression of those miRNAs
could re-sensitize MCF-Re cells to tamoxifen at different
extent (Figure 1F).
Among miR-15a family miRNAs, miR-15a/16 were
highly efficient to restore tamoxifen sensitivity and were
transcribed from the same cluster. In another tamoxifen
resistant ER positive cell line (T47D-Re), miR-15a/16
were also significantly down-regulated compared with
T47D-Pa cells (Figure S2B). Transfection of miR-15a/16
mimics reduced viability of MCF7-Re and T47D-Re
cells (Figure 1G, Figure S2C) and induced cell cycle
arrest (Figure 1I, Figure S2D) and apoptosis (Figure 1J,
Figure S2E) under tamoxifen treatment. On the other
hand, silencing miR-15a/16 expression by antisense
oligos (ASOs) reduced tamoxifen sensitivity of MCF7Pa cells (Figure 1H). Together, these data indicated that
miR-15a/16 were suppressed in tamoxifen resistant breast
cancer cells, and exogenous expression of miR-15a/16
mimics re-sensitized resistant cells to tamoxifen.

RESULTS
ERα positive breast cancer cells with long-term
exposure to tamoxifen acquired resistance to
tamoxifen- induced proliferation inhibition and
apoptosis
In order to develop an in vitro model of tamoxifen
resistance, we developed a tamoxifen resistant cell line
model similar to previous studies [15,16]. ERα positive
and tamoxifen sensitive breast cancer cell lines MCF7
and T47D were cultured in phenol-free media supplied
with charcoal-stripped bovine serum (cFBS) and exposed
to increased concentration of tamoxifen up to 1 μM
for 1 year. Tamoxifen inhibits MCF7 cell proliferation
by inducing G1/G0 arrest of cell cycle and causes cell
death [17, 18]. But after one year exposure of tamoxifen,
MCF7 parental (MCF7-Pa) cells and T47D parental
(T47D-Pa) cells acquired resistance to tamoxifen, and

MiR-15a/16 reduce tamoxifen resistance by
inhibiting Bcl-2 and Cyclin E1

miR-15a/16 in regulating tamoxifen sensitivity. We found
that both Bcl-2 and Cyclin E1 protein expression were
up-regulated in MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cells (Figure 2A,
Figure S3A). Transfection with mimics of miR-15a and
miR-16 reduced Bcl-2 and cyclin E1 protein expression in
MCF7-Re cells (Figure 2B), while miR-15a and miR-16
ASOs increased Bcl-2 and Cyclin E1 expression in MCF7Pa cells (Figure 2C).
To further evaluate whether miR-15a/16-inhibited
expression of Cyclin E1 and Bcl-2 is responsible for
tamoxifen resistance, we co-transfected MCF7-Re cells
with mimics of miR-15a or miR-16 and a pcDNA6B vector

Previous studies showed that Bcl-2 [9, 11] and Cyclin
E1 [19] were target genes of miR-15a/16. Bcl-2 is an
important player in multidrug resistance in different types
of cancer and miR-15a/16 were shown to induce apoptosis
by targeting Bcl-2 in CLL [20]. It was also reported that
high expression of Cyclin E1 was a strong predictor of
endocrine therapy failure in human breast cancer [21].
In light of the previous findings, we examined
whether Bcl-2 and Cyclin E1 were the functional targets of

carrying Bcl-2 coding sequence (CDS) or Cyclin E1 CDS.
Western blotting demonstrated that co-transfection of
pcDNA6B vectors carrying Bcl-2 or Cyclin E1 expression
cassette restored the protein expression of Bcl-2 or Cyclin
E1 respectively. (Figure 2D). Moreover, restoring Bcl-2
or Cyclin E1 expression in MCF7-Re cells transfected
with miR15a/16 mimics recapitulated tamoxifan-resistant
phenotype of MCF7-Re cells, including enhanced
proliferation (Figure 2E), reduced cell cycle arrest
(Figure 2F) and reduced apoptosis (Figure 2G). Moreover,
re-expression of both Bcl-2 and Cyclin E1 almost fully
restored tamoxifen-resistance (Figure 2E–2G) when miR15a/16 mimics were co-transfected, suggesting Bcl-2
and Cyclin E1 work synergistically to confer tamoxifen
resistance in breast cancer cells, but not being redundant to
each other. Together, these results demonstrate that miR15a/16 re-sensitize tamoxifen resistant cells to tamoxifen
by targeting Bcl-2 and Cyclin E1.

transcriptional activities. This result suggested the
presence of key regulatory elements between −150bp to
+132 bp of the promoter. Indeed, a consensus E2F binding
sequence was found in this region using TFSEARCH
(http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) [22]
(Figure 3D). Furthermore, mutation of this E2F binding
site significantly decreased the transcription activity in
MCF7-Pa (p < 0.001) and MCF7-Re (p < 0.05) cells to
different extents (Figure 3E). This is in agreement with the
findings that the promoter is more actively transcribed in
MCF7-Pa cells than in MCF-Re cells.
E2F1 has been reported to stimulate miR-15a/16
cluster expression in osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and
lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1299 by binding to the
same site of DLEU2 promoter [19]. Similar to these
findings, we showed that silencing E2F1 indeed decreased
the expression of mature miR-15a/16, pri-miR-15a/16 and
DLEU2 in MCF7-Pa cells (Figure S4 A.B). However, we
found that the protein level of E2F1 was similar between
MCF7-Re cells and MCF7-Pa cells (Figure 3F/3G),
suggesting the existence of another regulator.
It is known that E2F family members share very
similar DNA binding sequence, but their functions are
widely different and the regulation between E2F genes is
very complex [23]. Previous study demonstrated that E2F6
can repress gene transcription by interacting with E2F1
[34]. Therefore, we examined whether other E2F family
members participate in the transcriptional regulation
of miR-15a/16 cluster. Several activators (E2F1, E2F2,
E2F3a) were significantly up-regulated in MCF7-Re
cells than MCF7-Pa cells, while the only significantly
differentially expressed repressor was E2F7 (Figure 3F).
Western blot confirmed that E2F7 protein expression is
significantly up-regulated in MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cells
than their parent cells (Figure 3G, Figure S3B). Knocking
down of E2F7 by siRNAs restored the wild type DLEU2
promoter activity (Figure 3H) and up-regulated the
expression of mature miR-15a/16, pri-miR-15a/16 and
DLEU2 (Figure 3I, Figure S3C).
Choromatin immunoprecipitaion (ChIP) of DLEU2
promoter followed by qPCR was performed to examine
whether E2F1 and E2F7 bound to DLEU2 promoter.
Interestingly, the amount of E2F1 at E2F binding site in
DLEU2 promoter was significantly reduced in MCF7-Re
and T47D-Re cells, compared to their parent cells, while
E2F7 presence was significantly increased at the same
E2F binding site (Figure 3J, Figure S3D). This suggested
that in tamoxifen resistant cells, up-regulated E2F7
effectively competed with E2F1 for the E2F binding
site located at DLEU2 promoter, and transcriptionally
silenced DLEU2-miR-15b/16 expression. To further
validate this hypothesis, we knocked down E2F7 in
MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cells by siRNAs. Indeed,
silencing E2F7 in MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cells
significantly enhanced E2F1 binding at DLEU2 promoter
(Figure 3K, Figure S3E).

MiR-15a/16 cluster is transcriptionally inhibited
in tamoxifen resistant cells
The miR-15a and miR-16 cluster resides at
chromosome 13q14.3, a genomic region that is frequently
deleted in CLL and a subset of mantle cell lymphoma
[9, 10]. Nevertheless, deletion of this region is rare in
breast cancer patients [11]. MiR-15a and miR-16 are
encoded within an intronic region of the non-coding
DLEU2 gene in human and share the same promoter of
DLEU2. To explore how miR-15a/16 are down-regulated
in tamoxifen resistant cells, we measured the expression
of the primary transcript (pri-miR-15a/16) and DLEU2
in MCF7-Pa and MCF7-Re cells. Both of them were
significantly down-regulated at a similar ratio in MCF7-Re
(Figure 3A). Pri-miR-15a/16 and DLEU2 were also downregulated in T47D-Re cells compared with T47D-Pa cells
(Figure  S2B). Furthermore, the transcriptional activity
of DLEU2 promoter is significantly down-regulated in
MCF7-Re cells detected by luciferase reporter assay
(Figure 3B). These results indicated that miR-15a/16
cluster is transcriptionally inhibited in MCF7-Re cells.

E2F7 suppresses miR-15a/16 expression by
competing with E2F1
Transcription factors are the most important
regulators of transcription. Therefore, we investigated
which transcription factor is responsible for the downregulation of miR-15a/16 cluster. To narrow down the
targets, we constructed a series of sequentially deleted
DLEU2 promoters from −1755 ~ +320 to +132 ~ +320,
relative to transcription start site (TSS) (GRCh37/
hg13:50,656,139). The transcriptional activity of
+132 ~ +320 constructs was significantly decreased
compared with that of −150 ~ +320 (Figure 3C), whereas
other truncated promoter constructs showed similar

In conclusion, E2F7 is up-regulated in tamoxifen
resistant cells and repressed miR-15a/16 cluster expression

DLEU2 promoter.

(SCC), and could suppress proliferation and apoptotic
responses. Inhibition of E2F7 in a SCC cell line sensitized
the cells to UV-induced apoptosis and doxorubicin
induced apoptosis [13]. However, another study
indicated that down-regulation of E2F7 may contribute to
mechanisms underlying platinum resistance in 77 ovarian
cancer patients [14]. The expression and function of E2F7
in breast cancer patients especially the relationship with
tamoxifen resistance has never been reported.
To determine the role of E2F7 significance in
clinical specimen, we analyzed a publicly available
mRNA microarray dataset (GSE22219) [24, 25]. In this
dataset, ERα positive breast cancer patients (n = 134)
were treated with tamoxifen for 5 years and followed up
for 10 years. E2F7 expression was significantly higher in
the patients that had relapsed within 10-years follow-up
(n = 49) than in patients that had not relapsed (n = 85)
(p = 0.0001, Figure 5A). We also conducted a KaplanMeier survival analysis with samples dichotomized into
2 groups with E2F7 expression levels less than or equal
to median (n = 67) and levels more than median (n = 67).
The result indicated that higher expression of E2F7 is
significantly associated with poor distant relapse free
survival (p = 0.003, Figure 5B).

Silencing of E2F7 in tamoxifen resistant cells
re-sensitizes cells to tamoxifen
To investigate the effect of high E2F7 expression
in tamoxifen resistant cells, we silenced E2F7 by siRNAs
in MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cells. Bcl-2 and Cyclin
E1 protein expression were decreased after silencing of
E2F7 (Figure 4A, Figure S5A). In agreement, silencing
E2F7 re-sensitized MCF7-Re to tamoxifen, shown by
cell viability (Figure 4B, Figure S5B), cell cycle arrest
(Figure 4C, Figure S5C) and cell apoptosis (Figure 4D,
Figure S5D). These data indicated that highly expressed
E2F7 is key to tamoxifen resistance of cells.

Higher expression of E2F7 is significantly
correlated with poor prognosis and higher risk of
relapse in tamoxifen treated patients
Previous study identified that E2F7 was
overexpressed in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas

Next, we evaluated the correlation of E2F7
expression with clinic pathological status of the 134
patients analyzed in Figure 5A (Table 2). No significant
correlation was observed between E2F7 mRNA level and

age, tumor size, lymph node metastasis. However, E2F7
expression was significantly associated with tumor grade
(p = 0.041) and strongly associated with distant relapse

DISCUSSION

serve as an independent prognostic factor of distant
relapse free survival time for those 134 patients in a
multivariate Cox regression analysis of all the available
clinic pathological factors of the GSE22219 dataset
(p = 0.0033, HR=2.51 95% CI: 1.36-4.64, Figure 5C).
To further validate the prognostic value of E2F7
expression in a large population of breast cancer patients
receiving tamoxifen, we did a meta-analysis of all the
publicly available datasets that have complete survival
data and clearly indicated the use of tamoxifen. Five
datasets (GSE6532-plus2, GSE6532-U133B [26],
GSE9195 [27], GSE3494 [28], GSE58644 [29]), together
with GSE22219, were chosen after screening GEO and
ArrayExpress websites. Some other datasets were not
chosen because their microarray had no E2F7 probe or
the qualified patients were less than 30. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis of each dataset indicated that E2F7 high
expression is significantly associated with poor relapse
free survival after tamoxifen treatment in 3 of 6 datasets
(p < 0.05, Figure 5B, Figure S6). The result of fixed
effect model (p < 0.0001, HR = 1.83, 95%CI: 1.38-2.45)
and random effect model (p = 0.0008, HR = 1.87, 95%
CI: 1.30-2.71) of meta-analysis all indicated a significant
prognostic impact of the E2F7 expression in a total of 696
tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients (Figure 5D).
In conclusion, high E2F7 expression is significantly
correlated with relapse risk and relapse free survival in a
large population and may serve as an independent prognostic
factor in breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen.

In this study, we developed two in vitro tamoxifen
resistant cell lines and performed a miRNA expression
profile - functional screening on MCF7 cell line. We
identified two down-regulated and functionally relevant
miRNAs, miR-15a and miR-497. Interestingly, miR15a and miR-497 belong to the same family. Our further
investigation indicated that most of miR-15a family
members, especially miR-15a/16, were reduced in the
MCF7-Re cells and exogenous overexpression of miR15a/16 re-sensitized MCF7-Re and T47D-Re cells to
tamoxifen by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Those function were largely dependent on Bcl-2 and
Cyclin E1, which were associated with tamoxifen
resistance in previous studies [30, 31].
MiR-15a/16 are known to act as tumor suppressors
by targeting multiple oncogenes. MiR-15a/16 were
frequently deleted in CLL [32] and their downregulation
has been reported in a variety of cancers, such as pituitary
adenomas, and prostate carcinoma [33]. Exogenous
expression of these miRNAs inhibited cell proliferation,
promoted apoptosis, and suppressed tumorigenicity
both in vitro and in vivo [9]. However, in most cancers,
mechanisms underlying the downregulation of miR15a/16 cluster remained illusive. Investigation of the
upstream mechanisms how miR-15a/16 cluster is silenced
is important for developing appropriate targets or drugs to
overcome problems such as tamoxifen resistance. We now

found that E2F7 was responsible for the repression of miR15a/16 cluster by competing with E2F1 for binding to the
promoter of miR-15a/16 host gene DLEU2 in tamoxifen
resistant breast cancer cells. It was also reported that
E2F6 inhibited the expression of Apaf-1 via competing
with E2F1 for the E2F-consensus site of Apaf-1 promoter
in K562 cells [34]. Our study provides another evidence
for the mechanism that repressive E2Fs could inhibit the
transcription of E2F target genes by directly competing
with active E2Fs.
Development of more specific biomarkers that
predict therapeutic response to tamoxifen therapy is one of
the major challenges for the successful treatment of breast
cancer [1]. Re-analysis of microarray data is a powerful
method to study the association between gene expression
levels and clinic-pathological parameters in published
datasets [35]. After re-analyzing E2F7 mRNA expression
data in all 134 ER positive patients of GSE22219 dataset,
we found that highly expressed E2F7 is significantly
associated with high risk of relapse and E2F7 expression
level can serve as an independent prognostic indicator.
Additionally, meta-analysis of 696 tamoxifen-treated
patients from multiple datasets strongly suggests that high
expression of E2F7 is significantly associated with poor
prognosis after tamoxifen therapy. This data corroborated
that E2F7 may be an independent prognosis indicator in
ER positive breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen.
In summary, we found that miR-15a/16 are critical
in tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer. Further analysis
of its targets and upstream regulatory mechanism showed
that highly expressed E2F7 represses miR-15a/16
expression, which then up-regulates Bcl-2 and Cyclin
E1 to induce tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer cells.
Analysis of multiple independent datasets indicated
that E2F7 is significantly associated with the prognosis
of breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen. High
expression of E2F7 may be developed as an independent
marker for poor prognosis in breast cancer patients
receiving tamoxifen and targeting E2F7 could be an
effective strategy to overcome tamoxifen resistance.

reported studies [15, 16]. Before transfection and analysis,
parent cells and tamoxifen resistant cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium without phenol red supplemented
with 5% cFBS and without tamoxifen at least 4 days.
All of the cell lines were maintained in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
4-hydroxytamoxifen was purchased from SigmaAldrich (MO, USA) and dissolved in ethanol. MiRNA
mimics, miRNA ASO and siRNAs were purchased from
RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). The siRNA sequences
targeting to E2F7 and E2F1 in this study were chosen from
previous report [36].

MiRNA microarray analysis
Affymetrix® GeneChip® miRNA Array 3.0 was
conducted to detect the expression of miRNAs in MCF7-Pa
and MCF7-Re cells. After cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
without phenol red supplemented with 5% cFBS and without
tamoxifen, total RNA was harvested using TRIzol® reagent
(Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA extraction and miRNA profile detection
was provided by CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China).
Raw data were analyzed using expression console software
version 1.2 using default analysis settings and RMA as
normalization method. MiRNAs with values above the
cutoff of 10 in all samples were chosen for data analysis.
Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified through
Fold Change filtering. Microarray data were deposited to
GEO database with the accession code GSE66607.

Cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle assay
Cells transfected with miRNA mimics or
ASOs or siRNAs and treated with 1 uM tamoxifen
for 3 or 4 days.  Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,
5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). Cells for
apoptosis were harvested and stained with Annexin V-PI
apoptosis kit (Multisciences Biotech, Hangzhou, China)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. For cell cycle
analysis, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol
for one night and stained with propidium iodide (PI).
Apoptosis and cell cycle were detected using Accuri™ C6
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). The fractions
of cells in each phase of cell cycle (G0/G1, S and G2/M,
as indicated as % cells) were determined using Flowjo 7.6
cell cycle analysis software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The human breast cancer MCF7 and T47D cell line
was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). MCF7-Pa cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 40U/ml insulin. T47D-Pa cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Tamoxifen resistant
sublines (MCF7-Re and T47D-Re) were maintained in
1640 medium without phenol red (Life Technologies,
USA) supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS
(cFBS) (HyClone, USA) and 1 uM 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) according to previous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

purchased from ProteinTech (Wuhan, China). All blots were
detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
with ChemiDoc™ XRS+ imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA,
USA). Images were analyzed with Image Lab™ Software
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA).

Construction of plasmids and Luciferase
activity assay

Data were presented in terms of means and standard
errors for at least three separate experiments. Two tail
Student’s t test was used to compare two treatment groups.
Graph Pad Prism version 5 (GraphPad software Inc., CA,
USA) was used for statistical analysis. The results were
considered statistically significant when p is less than 0.05.

Statistical analysis

Potential upstream promoter regions of DLEU2
were amplified using PCR and cloned into the pGL3-basic
vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously
[37]. A series of deleted promoter fragment and E2F
binding site mutant promoter fragment were amplified
using PCR and cloned into the pGL3-basic vector [37].
Dual luciferase reporter assay was performed using Dualluciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison,
WI) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Analysis of patient data
A dataset with 134 ER positive patients who were
treated with tamoxifen for 5 years and have complete
10 years follow-up information was obtained from the
NCBI GEO database (GEO Accession GSE22219).
The expression of E2F7 mRNA expression values were
obtained from processed data and were compared between
patients who had relapsed after surgery using two tail
Student’s t test. 134 ER positive patients were equally
divided into two groups based on the E2F7 mRNA level
and Kaplan-Meier survival curve was carried out in Graph
Pad prism software and between groups comparison was
performed using the log-rank test. A chi-square test was
used to analyze the association between E2F7 mRNA
expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics,
the result was shown in table 2. The survival data were
then evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox
regression model on MedCalc software for windows,
version 14.12.0 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium)
as described previously [38]. Significant prognostic
parameters (p < 0.05) were used to evaluate in multivariate
Cox regression model.
The meta-analyses were carried out using the
publicly available statistical computing language
R (version R-3.1.1) as described previously [17]. Briefly,
696 patients of 6 independent datasets were involved
after a comprehensive search in available databases.
Hazard ratio (HR) of every dataset was calculated on
MedCalc software independently. E2F7 expression
level was defined by the probe set intensity and if there
were two probe sets match the E2F7 mRNA in one
microarray platform, we took the average value of the
two probe sets. Fixed effect models and random effects
models of the R package “meta” were used based on
parameter estimates of log HRs in Cox models and their
SEs [39]. Results were visualized with forest plots, in
which parameter estimates of all single studies and the
pooled estimates along with their confidence intervals
are plotted on top of each other. Adjustment for multiple
testing was conducted with the method of Benjamini and
Hochberg [40].

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)
The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life
Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The reverse transcription was performed
using transcriptase (Life Technologies, USA), and the
real-time PCR was performed in a LightCycler480 System
using a SYBR Premix ExTaq kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan).
Bulge-Loop™ miRNA qPCR Primer Sets purchased from
RioboBio (Guangzhou, China) were used in the mature
miRNA reverse transcription and qPCR. U6 small nuclear
RNA was used as an internal control.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay
CHIP and following qPCR were performed using
Agarose ChIP Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, California,
USA) or ChIP-IT® Express Enzymatic CHIP Kit (Active
Motif, Carlsbad, USA) according to manufacturers’
instructions. Chip-grade primary antibodies against E2F7
(Santa Cruz biotechnology, USA) and E2F1 (Cell Signaling
Technology, MA, USA) were used in the chip experiments
and a normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz biotechnology,
USA) was served as a negative control. DLEU2 promoter
chip promoter: F. GCGGGGTTGGCTCTAACGAAT;
R. GGTTATCCTGTCTCTCCCGCT

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [37]. The β-actin antibody (ProteinTech, Wuhan,
China), Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz biotechnology, USA), Cyclin E1
(Santa Cruz biotechnology, USA), E2F1 (Cell Signaling
Technology, MA, USA), E2F7 (Santa Cruz biotechnology,
USA) were all used according to the manufacturers’
instructions. HRP-cojugated secondary antibodies were
