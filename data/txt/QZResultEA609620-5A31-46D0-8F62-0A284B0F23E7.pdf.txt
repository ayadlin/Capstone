BACKGROUND: With advances in oncologic treatment, cosmesis after mastectomy has assumed a pivotal role in
patient and provider decision making. Multiple studies have confirmed the safety of both chemotherapy before
breast surgery and immediate reconstruction. Little has been written about the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
on decisions about reconstruction. METHODS: The authors identified 665 patients with stage I through III breast
cancer who received chemotherapy and underwent mastectomy at Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women’s Cancer Center
from 1997 to 2007. By using multivariate logistic regression, reconstruction rates were compared between patients
who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n ¼ 180) and patients who underwent mastectomy before chemotherapy
(n ¼ 485). The rate of postoperative complications after mastectomy was determined for patients who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not. RESULTS: Reconstruction was performed immediately
in 44% of patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy but in only 23% of those who did. Twenty-one
percent of neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients and 14% of adjuvant-only chemotherapy recipients underwent
delayed reconstruction. After controlling for age, receipt of radiotherapy, and disease stage, neoadjuvant recipients
were less likely to undergo immediate reconstruction (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37, 0.87)
but were no more likely to undergo delayed reconstruction (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.75, 2.20). Surgical complications occurred in 30% of neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients and in 31% of adjuvant chemotherapy recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are less likely to
undergo immediate reconstruction and are no more likely to undergo delayed reconstruction than patients who

With advances in oncologic treatment, cosmesis after breast surgery has assumed a pivotal role in patient and provider
decision making. Reconstruction, once was delayed for months after surgery, has proven oncologically sound and presents
little additional risk of morbiditywhether autologous or prostheticwhen undertaken simultaneously with primary
breast surgery. 1-3 By avoiding an additional procedure and achieving an immediate improvement in cosmetic result, the
advantages for patients, both psychological and financial, have made immediate reconstruction a desired option
for many.4-6
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also has become a critical component of modern breast cancer care. By reducing tumor
burden in both the breast and the axilla, women may achieve complete resections with less extensive operations.7,8 To
date, randomized controlled trials have reported equivalent recurrence rates, disease-free survival rates, and overall survival
rates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.7,9 In addition, neoadjuvant therapy has both prognostic
and prescriptive value. Treatment response is predictive of long-term survival, whereas nonresponse may inform future
chemotherapy choices.8,10
However, despite their independent advantages, little is known about how decisions for neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and immediate reconstruction influence each other when used concurrently.11 Although it has been demonstrated that

apprehensions about delays in adjuvant treatment after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immediate reconstruction
are largely unwarranted,12 the interaction between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the receipt of reconstruction is
not well-described. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
is 1 of several clinical scenarios in which individual surgeon preference may have an impact on the timing of
reconstruction. In the current study, we sought to characterize how neoadjuvant chemotherapy influenced the use
of immediate breast reconstruction in a cohort of patients
from a large tertiary cancer center with a multiprovider,
multipractice, multisite plastics and reconstructive referral
network. We hypothesized that patients who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy would be less likely to
undergo immediate reconstruction after controlling for
other clinical characteristics, possibly because of complications during chemotherapy or treatment fatigue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Identification of Cohort and Data Abstraction
The Breast Oncology Center at Dana-Farber/Brigham &
Women’s Cancer Center includes surgical oncologists,
medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists,
pathologists, and plastic surgeons, among others, in a
large, multidisciplinary care team. Patients are referred to
1 of 12 plastic surgeons at the discretion of the breast surgical oncologist after initial consultation. The decision for
referral is individually based; patients with advanced
breast cancer may be candidates for breast reconstruction.
These plastic surgeons represent 3 different practices at
2 different hospitals; therefore, the approach to reconstruction is heterogeneous at our institution.
We identified 791 patients with stage I through III
breast cancer who received chemotherapy and underwent
mastectomy at Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women’s
Cancer Center between 1997 and 2007. Eighty-one
patients were excluded secondary to unclear details
regarding either the timing of their chemotherapy, the
timing of their surgery, and/or the laterality of their disease. We identified variables concerning demographics
(age, race, marital status), overall health (body mass index
[BMI], smoking status, number of comorbidities, presence of diabetes, premastectomy clinical status), disease
status (stage, tumor size, presence of lymph node metastases, estrogen receptor [ER]/progesterone receptor [PR]/
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [Her-2] status), and treatment (start and end dates for chemotherapy
regimen, use of radiation therapy, use of hormone therapy,

2834

surgical procedures, and procedure dates) from our internally maintained, prospectively collected database.
Recipients of neoadjuvant therapy underwent an
additional chart review to obtain detailed information on
the development of complications during neoadjuvant
therapy (inpatient admission, neutropenic fever, infectious complications, other severe side effects), the operation (mastectomy type, timing of reconstruction), and the
development of surgical complications (seroma requiring
drainage, hematoma, surgical site infection, dehiscence/
open wound, skin necrosis, flap failure/loss, thromboembolism) within 60 days of mastectomy. A similar
chart review was performed for the adjuvant-only group
to confirm the operative history (presence/absence
and timing of reconstruction) and the development of any
60-day postmastectomy surgical complications.
Patients with simultaneous bilateral cancer (n ¼ 23),
who had not undergone mastectomy with the intention of
curing a primary cancer (n ¼ 14), who were men (n ¼ 3),
and who had received atypical chemotherapy regimens
(eg, bone marrow transplantation; n ¼ 5) were excluded,
leaving a final sample of 485 recipients of adjuvant
therapy only and 180 recipients of neoadjuvant therapy
(N ¼ 665).

Data Analysis
Variables

Several variables were dichotomized based on a
priori judgment and/or to increase power: These included
marital status (single/divorced/widowed vs married),
smoking status (never/past smoker vs current smoker),
number of comorbidities (0-1 vs  2), lymph node (N)
metastasis (N0 vs  N1), tumor (T) classification (tumor
in situ [Tis]-T2 vs  T3), neoadjuvant complications
(none vs any), mastectomy type (skin sparing vs simple/
modified radical), reconstruction type (autologous
flap vs implant/tissue expander), and surgical complications (none vs any). Race was dichotomized (white
vs nonwhite) for the multivariate analyses only; all race/
ethnicity groups are included in the tables, reflecting univariate analyses. Age (< 50 years, 50-70 years,  70 years)
and BMI (underweight [< 18.5 kg/m2], normal [18.5-25
kg/m2], overweight [25-30 kg/m2], or obese [ 30 kg/
m2]) were categorized in univariate analyses for ease
of display and were retained as continuous variables for
multivariate analyses. Length of neoadjuvant therapy
was calculated in days and was retained as a continuous
variable for all analyses.

Timing of Chemotherapy & Reconstruction/Hu et al

There were 2 primary outcomes: receipt of immediate reconstruction (vs delayed/no reconstruction) and,
among patients who did not undergo immediate reconstruction, delayed reconstruction (vs no reconstruction).
The primary predictor of interest was treatment with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We controlled for other
covariates of clinical significance, as described above.
Univariate analyses

Recipients of neoadjuvant and adjuvant-only
chemotherapy were compared first by using the Fisher
exact and, where appropriate (age group, weight, preprocedure clinical status, stage), the Mantel-Haenszel
chi-square test for trend. Recipients of immediate reconstruction (n ¼ 256) were compared with recipients of
nonimmediate (delayed or no) reconstruction (n ¼ 409)
using the Fisher exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel chisquare test. The same analyses were repeated for the
subgroup that did not undergo immediate reconstruction
to identify univariate predictors of undergoing delayed
reconstruction (n ¼ 106) versus no reconstruction (n ¼
303). Additional variables (the development of neoadjuvant complications, length of neoadjuvant therapy)
were evaluated for their impact on the receipt of
immediate reconstruction in the neoadjuvant population
alone. Finally, patients who developed surgical complications were compared with those who did not using the
Fisher exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test.
Multivariate analyses

Multivariate logistic regressions for both outcome
comparisons (immediate vs delayed/no reconstruction,
delayed vs no reconstruction) and the development of surgical complications were performed next using covariates
that were of a priori interest and that had been significant
in univariate analyses. Remaining covariates of interest
were forced back into the model to check for confounding, which was defined as a change > 20% in the odds
ratio (OR) for any other covariate. By using the ASSESS
statement in SAS Proc Genmod (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC), a goodness-of-fit test statistic based on the sum of
the residuals was checked for both logistic regression
models.13 All analyses were performed using SAS version
9.1. Significance was set at a 2-sided P value of .05.

RESULTS
The majority of patients in our population were aged <
50 years, white, married, not overweight, nonsmokers,
and had few comorbidities. Table 1 lists the characteristics
Cancer

of our study population according to our main predictor
of interest: receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered as follows:
doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (17.8%), doxorubicin/
cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel (32.8%), paclitaxel (9.4%),
and other (40%). Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for
both the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and the
adjuvant chemotherapy group are provided in Table 1.
Transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous (TRAM)
flaps were the most commonly performed type of reconstruction (44.8%) followed by tissue expanders (30.4%),
latissimus dorsi flaps with implants (10.2%), latissimus
dorsi flaps alone (5.3%), immediate implants (5.0%),
deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps (3.9%), and free
flaps (0.6%). Alloderm was used in 72.7% of the tissue
expanders, in 50% of the immediate implants, and in
6.8% of the TRAM flaps.
Results of the univariate analysis predicting immediate reconstruction are provided in Table 2. Recipients of
neoadjuvant therapy were less likely to undergo immediate reconstruction (16.4% vs 33.7%; P < .01). Immediate
reconstruction was associated with younger patients (aged
< 50 years: 65.6% vs 51.3%; P < .01), higher preprocedural functional status (full activity: 81.6% vs 72.4%; P ¼
.01), less aggressive disease (stage I: 25.8% vs 12.2%; P <
.01;  T3: 12.6% vs 28.6%; P < .01;  N1: 57.4% vs
72.6%; P < .01), low or normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/
m2: 59.2% vs 50.7%; P ¼ .03), nonreceipt of radiotherapy (55.7% vs 30.1%; P < .01), and adjuvant chemotherapy type (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide: 42.6% vs
30.8%; other: 19.5% vs 23.5%; P ¼ .01). Among neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients, length of neoadjuvant
therapy (82.8 days vs 86.7 days; P ¼ .41) and the rate of
complications during neoadjuvant therapy (38.1% vs
39.9%; P ¼ .86) were similar for those who did and did
not undergo immediate reconstruction.
In the remaining patients (those who did not
undergo immediate reconstruction), delayed reconstruction was predicted only by younger age (< 50 years:
74.5% vs 43.2%; P < .01), lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2:
67.4% vs 45.3%; P < .01), and the lack of diabetes
(99.1% vs 93.4%; P ¼ .02). All other covariates were nonsignificant on univariate analysis.
Patients who developed surgical complications
tended to be older (aged  50 years: 53.6% vs 38.4%;
P < .01) and overweight/obese (BMI  25: 56.9% vs
41.2%; P < .01). Patients who underwent more extensive
surgery (reconstruction at the time of mastectomy) tended
to experience complications more frequently, as expected:

In the 60 days after mastectomy.
‘‘Any’’ is not the sum of all complications; some patients developed more
than 1 complication.

b

37.1% of patients who underwent immediate reconstruction developed postmastectomy complications compared
with only 24.5% of patients who underwent delayed
reconstruction and 27.7% of patients who did not
undergo reconstruction (P ¼ .02). Of those who underwent reconstruction, the complication rate was higher
among those who received autogenous tissue flaps than
those who received expanders or implants (39.7% vs
21.9%; P < .01). The receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with the development of
postmastectomy complications, as indicated in Table 3.
This result did not change when the analysis was stratified
by timing of reconstruction. After undergoing mastectomy alone, 28.3% of patients who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy developed a complication compared with
26.2% of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy
only (P ¼ .72). With the addition of immediate reconstruction, these rates increased to 35.7% and 37.4%,
respectively, but remained statistically similar across
groups (P ¼ 1.00).
After controlling for age, disease stage, and the
receipt of radiotherapy, the receipt of neoadjuvant therapy
reduced the odds of undergoing immediate
reconstruction by more than half (adjusted OR, 0.57;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.87; P < .01). The
adjusted predicted probability of undergoing immediate
reconstruction in recipients of neoadjuvant therapy was
0.28 (95% CI, 0.21-0.36), compared with 0.40 (95% CI,
0.36-0.45) in patients receiving only adjuvant therapy.
Among the remaining patients who did not undergo
immediate reconstruction, multivariate regression produced only 2 significant predictors of the receipt of

2838

delayed reconstruction: younger age (adjusted OR, 0.93/
year; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96; P < .01) and lower BMI (0.90/
point; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95; P < .01). After controlling for
those covariates, receipt of neoadjuvant therapy was no
longer a significant predictor of undergoing delayed
reconstruction (adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.75-2.20;
P ¼ .36). The goodness-of-fit test produced P values of
.724 (for the immediate vs delayed/no reconstruction)
and .506 (for delayed vs no reconstruction), suggesting
that these logistic regression models are appropriate.
The multivariate model predicting surgical complications contained 4 significant covariates. Each year of
age increased the adjusted odds of developing a complication by 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01-1.05; P < .01). Similarly,
with each point increase in BMI, the adjusted odds
increased by 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P < .01). Compared with patients who had smaller tumors, patients
who had  T3 tumors had an adjusted OR of 1.06
(95% CI, 1.03-2.51; P ¼ .03). Immediate reconstruction, as expected, had the largest impact, with an
adjusted OR of 2.08 (95% CI, 1.4-3.05; P < .01).
Receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was nonsignificant (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.65-1.52; P ¼ .96).

DISCUSSION
Research has confirmed the safety and efficacy of both
neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone7-10 and immediate
reconstruction alone1-3,12,14-18, but data addressing both
concurrently are limited. In 1 study of 22 patients with
locally advanced (stage IIB or III) cancer who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent immediate
reconstruction, there was no delay in adjuvant treatment,
but the perioperative morbidity rate was 14%.19 Another
series of 31 patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
immediate TRAM flap reconstruction demonstrated an
adjuvant treatment delay of 6% and a postoperative
complication rate of 55%.20 In 48 other patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent
immediate reconstruction, the mean time between surgery
and adjuvant chemotherapy was 26 days.16 Azzawi et al
did not observe any differences in the time to adjuvant
therapy or in failure, reoperation, or minor complication
rates between recipients and nonrecipients of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in a single surgeon’s immediate breast
reconstruction population.21 Similarly, in the study by
Warren Peled et al, a cohort of 57 neoadjuvant and 41
adjuvant-only chemotherapy recipients demonstrated
no differences in reoperation, skin necrosis, implant/

expander/flap loss, seroma, or ventral hernia rates after
immediate reconstruction.11 All of those studies had small
sample sizes, few included a comparison with delayed or
no reconstruction16 or adjuvant-only chemotherapy,11,21
and none adequately addressed both the timing of reconstruction and the timing of chemotherapy simultaneously.
Current practices in the timing of reconstruction
seem to vary according to disease stage and provider/institutional philosophies about the risks associated with the
administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant
chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Some centers
favor postponing all reconstructions if postmastectomy
radiation therapy is likely,22 such that patients who
eventually do not require radiation are forced to endure a
delay and to forgo a skin-sparing mastectomy.23 Others
routinely perform immediate reconstruction despite the
need for radiation,21,24 which may have an impact on
both the quality of radiation delivery and the esthetic
outcome.25,26 At The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center, Kronowitz and colleagues have
pioneered the delayed-immediate approach, in which
patients with stage II (and select patients with stage I)
disease who desire reconstruction undergo immediate tissue expander placement followed either by reconstruction
within 2 weeks if radiation is not required or by deflation
(immediately before delivery), reinflation (2 weeks after
delivery), and delayed reconstruction (within 3 months of
delivery) if radiation is required. Receipt of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is yet another consideration within this
algorithm; for patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the expander is left inflated for the 4-week to 6week period between mastectomy and radiation.23,27
Although these reports all contribute to our understanding about the appropriate times at which reconstruction
should be offered to breast cancer patients, none characterize the frequency of actual receipt.
Our study revealed that recipients of neoadjuvant
therapy are less likely to undergo immediate reconstruction, even after controlling for age, disease stage, and
receipt of radiotherapy. Accounting for these variables,
the average neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipient has a
28% chance of undergoing immediate reconstruction
compared with 40% for the average patient who receives
only adjuvant chemotherapy. These neoadjuvant recipients, however, are not more likely to progress to delayed
reconstruction. Only younger age and lower BMI seem
to predict delayed reconstruction among patients who
do not undergo immediate reconstruction. Because
Alderman et al observed an increased likelihood of delay

Cancer

in the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
higher BMI who underwent immediate reconstruction,14
delayed reconstruction appears to be a prudent choice in
this population. However, our results demonstrate a
diminishing likelihood of undergoing delayed reconstruction with increasing BMI. Patient or surgeon preference
may contribute to these findings. Another explanation
may be treatment fatigue; neoadjuvant chemotherapy
recipients already have submitted themselves to additional
weeks of an exhausting therapy before mastectomy and,
thus, may be less willing to schedule an additional elective
operation. Future research should address this issue.
The failure to demonstrate a statistically significant
increase in delayed reconstruction procedures among neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients also may be an issue of
power. We would have needed 916 neoadjuvant recipients and 2618 adjuvant recipients to detect our observed
OR of 1.29 with 80% power (and a ¼ .05), assuming a
similar study and a similar ratio of neoadjuvant-to-adjuvant chemotherapy recipients.
Contrary to our hypothesis, immediate reconstruction is not predicted by the length of neoadjuvant therapy
(as a measure of delay) or by complications during neoadjuvant therapy. However, our chart reviewers noted
qualitatively that many patients who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy either planned to undergo or demonstrated
an interest in undergoing delayed reconstruction at
presentation, but they experienced a range of social and/or
medical complications (eg, divorce, death of a loved one,
loss of family income, development of a second primary
cancer, chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy) that
seemingly precluded eventual reconstruction. Again,
treatment fatigue may be an important issue to investigate. Because >95% of our patients received adjuvant
chemotherapy, we cannot address the potential role
played by adjuvant chemotherapy (compared with no
adjuvant chemotherapy) in this cohort.
In our study, the rate of complications in patients
who underwent reconstruction after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 37.1%, which was higher than the
26.9% rate among patients who underwent mastectomy
alone. This trend is consistent with prior work17,28 and is
not surprising, as the addition of a reconstruction necessarily makes any procedure more extensive. Our rates
compare favorably with those reported elsewhere. Fiftyfive percent of the 31 patients reported by Deutsch et al
developed a complication after receiving neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and undergoing immediate TRAM
reconstruction.20 The Michigan Breast Reconstruction

2839

Original Article

Outcome Study, which includes 23 plastic surgeons at 12
centers, reported a complication rate of 45.4%.28 Thirtyone percent of the 163 patients reported by Warren Peled
et al who underwent immediate reconstruction developed
a complication that required a return to the operating
room.11 In a cohort of 62 patients who underwent
immediate reconstruction, Mortensen et al reported that
22.3% experienced complications.17 Similarly, Furey et al
documented a complication rate of 27.8% in 36 patients
who underwent immediate reconstruction and received
adjuvant chemotherapy.29
Factors that predispose patients to the development
of postoperative complications are important to investigate, as low-risk patients may be targeted for immediate,
rather than delayed, reconstruction. The only factors that
we identified as predictive of surgical complications in our
neoadjuvant population were age, tumor size, and BMI.
Weight has been correlated previously with postoperative
complications. Alderman et al calculated an 8% increase
in risk with each additional point in BMI.28 Chang et al
estimated that a BMI 25 kg/m2 doubled the incidence
of both flap and donor site complications in free TRAM
reconstructions, even after controlling for the receipt of
preoperative radiotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.30 We did not observe that smoking was related significantly to the development of complications; however,
the number of smokers was limited to 16 within our neoadjuvant cohort. The existing data on the effect of smoking is conflicting. Both Alderman et al28 and Deutsch
et al20 failed to observe any significant differences in complication rates between smokers and nonsmokers; however, Chang et al31 demonstrated an increase in
mastectomy skin flap necrosis, abdominal flap necrosis,
and hernia among free TRAM flap recipients. The occurrence of mastectomy skin flap necrosis was accentuated
when the reconstruction was timed to coincide with the
mastectomy; hence, the group at The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center advocates delaying these
reconstructions in active smokers.31
This work represents a single-institution experience;
therefore, generalizability is a concern. Because the DanaFarber Cancer Institute is a large, comprehensive cancer
center associated with a tertiary care institution, the
availability and use of certain services (eg, plastic/reconstructive surgery) may differ from that of the general
community. The most predictive factor of undergoing
reconstruction is documentation of a patient-provider
discussion regarding reconstruction,32 and surgeons who
have high clinical breast surgery volumes and who work in

2840

cancer centers are known to have higher referral rates to
plastic surgery for breast reconstruction.33 Our work may
be subject to reviewer subjectivity, a problem inherent to
chart review, although we believe we minimized this
problem by standardizing variable definitions (eg, infectious complication during neoadjuvant chemotherapy
required antibiotic administration) using physicians with
clinical surgical experience as reviewers and adjudicating
disputes with a breast surgical oncologist.
We were unable to capture any events that were not
documented in the electronic medical records. If, for example, a patient was seen for a chemotherapy-related or postoperative complication at another hospital, then we would
not have been able to identify it unless it was mentioned explicitly by a Dana-Farber provider in a note filed within the
defined neoadjuvant chemotherapy or 60-day postmastectomy periods. Therefore, our estimates of complication and
reconstruction rates are potentially biased in a conservative
direction. However, because our reviewers indicated that
these notes were exceptionally thorough, with detailed
weekly assessments that frequently incorporated medical
and social events external to the system, we believe the effect
of said bias is likely minimal.
We have demonstrated that women who receive
neoadjuvant chemotherapy are significantly less likely to
undergo immediate reconstruction and are no more likely
to undergo delayed reconstruction than patients who
undergo mastectomy before they receive chemotherapy.
This phenomenon does not appear to be the result of
neoadjuvant-related complications. It will be important
to investigate other measures of treatment fatigue for both
adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients.
Considering the recent expansion of the neoadjuvant
population (as criteria for neoadjuvant treatment are
broadened) and the importance of cosmesis in quality of
life, patients and providers alike are in need of this type of
evidence regarding the interaction between medical,
surgical, and radiation therapies in the treatment of breast
cancer. Further research is needed to corroborate and
build upon our findings.
