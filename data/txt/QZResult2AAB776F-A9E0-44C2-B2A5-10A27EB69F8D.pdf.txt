ABSTRACT
We performed proteomic studies using the GRP78 chaperone-inhibitor drug AR12 (OSU-03012) as bait. Multiple additional chaperone and chaperone-associated
proteins were shown to interact with AR-12, including: GRP75, HSP75, BAG2; HSP27;
ULK-1; and thioredoxin. AR-12 down-regulated in situ immuno-fluorescence detection
of ATP binding chaperones using antibodies directed against the NH2-termini of the
proteins but only weakly reduced detection using antibodies directed against the
central and COOH portions of the proteins. Traditional SDS-PAGE and western blotting
assessment methods did not exhibit any alterations in chaperone detection. AR-12
altered the sub-cellular distribution of chaperone proteins, abolishing their punctate
speckled patterning concomitant with changes in protein co-localization. AR-12
inhibited chaperone ATPase activity, which was enhanced by sildenafil; inhibited
chaperone – chaperone and chaperone – client interactions; and docked in silico
with the ATPase domains of HSP90 and of HSP70. AR-12 combined with sildenafil
in a GRP78 plus HSP27 –dependent fashion to profoundly activate an eIF2α/ATF4/
CHOP/Beclin1 pathway in parallel with inactivating mTOR and increasing ATG13
phosphorylation, collectively resulting in formation of punctate toxic autophagosomes.
Over-expression of [GRP78 and HSP27] prevented: AR-12 –induced activation of ER
stress signaling and maintained mTOR activity; AR-12 –mediated down-regulation
of thioredoxin, MCL-1 and c-FLIP-s; and preserved tumor cell viability. Thus the
inhibition of chaperone protein functions by AR-12 and by multi-kinase inhibitors
very likely explains why these agents have anti-tumor effects in multiple genetically
diverse tumor cell types.

INTRODUCTION

greater amounts of cellular protein than non-transformed
cells. e.g. multiple myeloma cells. Thus some chaperone
proteins, e.g. HSP90, have been the target for many
developmental therapeutic chemists and also tumor cell
biology researchers. In the field of virology, chaperone
proteins, particularly GRP78 have also been recognized as
playing essential roles in the life cycles of both DNA and
RNA viruses [10, 11]. Based on the fact our cancer biology
data with chaperones and OSU-03012 was congruent with
the wider literature exploring the roles of chaperones in
virus biology, we recently performed studies to determine
whether OSU-03012 could alter virus reproduction
in vitro. Using OSU-03012 or using the multi-kinase
inhibitors sorafenib (Nexavar) and pazopanib (Votrient)
we determined that the expression of multiple chaperones
was rapidly reduced following drug treatment; effects that
were magnified by sildenafil [12, 13]. Using molecular
tools we proved that the down-regulation of GRP78 was
an essential property of these drugs in preventing virus
reproduction.
The present studies were initiated to determine
whether OSU-03012 or sorafenib or pazopanib altered the
expression/localization of additional chaperone proteins and
to identify novel targets of OSU-03012 using a proteomics
approach. Novel targets from the mass spectrometry studies
were then tested as OSU-03012 targets in vitro and whether
such targets regulated tumor cell biology.

In 2005 the Dent laboratory published studies
which strongly argued that the PDK-1 inhibitor OSU03012 (licensed by Arno Therapeutics from Ohio State
University and called AR-12) was not primarily acting
as a PDK-1 inhibitor to radio-sensitize tumor cells [1, 2].
In 2006 we demonstrated that the primary mechanism
by which AR-12 killed tumor cells was via the PKRlike endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) -dependent
induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling and
a toxic form of autophagy which through mitochondrial
dysfunction with the release of both cytochrome c and AIF
and a necroptotic form of cell death [3].
Follow-on studies then linked the effects of AR-12
on tumor cell biology to regulation of the chaperone
proteins HSP90, GRP78 and HSP70 [4]. It was observed
that AR-12 reduced the protein levels of HSP90 and
GRP78 but stimulated HSP70 expression in a PERKdependent fashion, as measured using the standard
techniques of SDS PAGE and western immuno-blotting.
Others independently confirmed our findings regarding
AR-12 and the induction of cytotoxic ER stress [5].
Finally, as AR-12 down-regulates the PERK inhibitory
chaperone GRP78, and as the induction of toxic autophagy
was PERK dependent, we investigated the role of reduced
GRP78 expression caused by AR-12 in the regulation
of drug toxicity. AR-12 did not alter the transcription of
GRP78 to any significant extent but instead destabilized
the GRP78 protein itself, considerably reducing its halflife as assessed by western blotting from > 24 hours to
approximately 10 hours [6]. Over-expression of GRP78
prevented AR-12 induced PERK activation; autophagy
induction, and tumor cell killing.
Our studies published in 2014 and 2015 using AR-12
have further emphasized the importance of chaperones and
particularly GRP78 in the cell biology effects of OSU03012 (AR-12). We discovered that phosphodiesterase 5
inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis)
synergized with OSU-03012 to kill a wide variety of
tumor cells through enhanced PERK-dependent ER
stress and autophagy, as well as through activation of
the death receptor CD95 (FAS-R) [7]. Similar data
were also obtained with the parent drug of OSU-03012,
celecoxib, and also with the multi-kinase inhibitors
sorafenib, regorafenib and pazopanib [8, 9]. Our in vitro
and animal based studies are now two open clinical
trials; in all solid tumor patients (NCT02466802) where
patients are receiving increasing once daily (QD) dosing
with regorafenib and sildenafil; in recurrent glioblastoma
patients (NCT01817751) where they receive sorafenib,
sildenafil and valproate twice daily (BID).
Multiple chaperone proteins play essential roles
in maintaining protein stability and cell signaling, most
particularly in tumor cells which generally express much

RESULTS
Treatment of HuH7 hepatoma or HT1080 sarcoma
cells with OSU-03012 +/− sildenafil or sorafenib +/−
sildenafil resulted in a rapid dose- and time-dependent
reduction in the detection of the ATP binding and ATPase
competent chaperone proteins HSP90, GRP78 and HSP70
in fixed in situ cells as judged using immuno-fluorescence
with 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X100 for cell permeabilization
from a Hermes WiScan wide field microscope (Figure 1A
and 1B). Similar changes in the apparent levels of
HSP90, GRP78 and HSP70 were also obtained using
immuno-fluorescence in the primary human glioblastoma
isolates GBM5 (PDGFRα+) and GBM12 (mutant active
full length ERBB1) (Figure 1C). Expression of dominant
negative eIF2α blocked OSU-03012 –induced expression
of LC3 and Beclin1 (Figure 1D). We have previously
published that OSU-03012 and [OSU-03012 + sildenafil]
kills tumor cells through a PERK-dependent form of
toxic autophagy [3]. In contrast to the altered detection /
expression levels of chaperone proteins in Figure 1A–1D
using in situ immuno-fluorescence staining, the detection
of the kinases ERK2 and JNK1 which are of course also
ATP binding proteins with ATPase activity, were not
altered by any of drug treatments at this time as judged
using either immuno-fluorescence or SDS PAGE followed
by traditional western blotting (Figure 2A).

Using antibodies raised against different epitopes
within HSP90 and GRP78 we observed that treatment of
cells with OSU-03012 reduced the immuno-fluorescence
detection of GRP78 and HSP90 with antibodies raised
against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues
270–300 in human GRP78 and against synthetic peptides
surrounding E289 of human HSP90; the standard
antibodies we have used to detect these proteins in
multiple other manuscripts. We also observed reduced
immuno-fluorescence using antibodies that were generated
to recognize epitopes even nearer the NH2-termini of both
proteins (Figure 2B). However, using antibodies generated
against sequences in the central region, i.e. G584 in
GRP78 and between residues 535–732 in HSP90; or in
the COOH-termini, i.e. residues 603–617 in GRP78 and
near the TPR acceptor site dimerization residues MEEVD
in HSP90, modest to no alterations in the immunofluorescence signal was observed.
Using siRNA knock-down or protein overexpression we validated that our antibodies to these
chaperones were specifically reacting with their targets
(Figure 2C and 2D panels to the left). In contrast to our

data with the protein kinases ERK2 and JNK1, where data
obtained from immuno-fluorescence and SDS PAGE/
western blotting were congruent, the detection of HSP90,
GRP78 and HSP70 chaperone expression by immunofluorescence and SDS PAGE / western blotting using the
same antibodies at the 6h time point were not in agreement
(Figure 2D panels to the right; cf Figure 1A–1D).
Previously, using SDS PAGE / western blotting we
had demonstrated that OSU-03012 destabilizes GRP78
protein resulting in a half-life reduction from > 24 h to
~10 h despite modestly increasing GRP78 promoter
activity [6]. Thus to the naked eye a substantial decline
in GRP78 levels, as assessed by western blotting, only
became evident 6-12h after OSU-03012 exposure. This
contrasts with the present immuno-fluorescence and
western blot data in Figures 1A–1D and 2A–2D where
OSU-03012 as a single agent dramatically reduces the
immuno-fluorescence detection of HSP90, GRP78 and
HSP70 within 6h but does not alter the signal detected by
western blotting. As some types of cellular membrane are
not permeabilized by Triton X-100 we examined immunofluorescence staining in fixed cells after they had been

OSU-03012 (0–3.0 µM) and/or sildenafil (2 µM) for 2 h after which cells were fixed in place and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X100.
Immuno-fluorescence was performed to detect the expression levels of GRP78, HSP70 and HSP90. The relative fluorescence intensity
value from 40 different cells from each condition was determined using Hermes system software (+/− SEM). (C) GBM5 and GBM12 cells

permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X100. Immuno-fluorescence was performed to detect the expression levels of GRP78, HSP70 and HSP90.
(D) As indicated, GBM5, GBM6 and GBM12 cells were transfected with either an empty vector plasmid (CMV) or a plasmid to express
dominant negative eIF2α S51A. Twenty four h after transfection cells were treated with vehicle, OSU-03012 (2.0 µM) and/or sildenafil
(2 µM) for 6 h after which cells were fixed in place and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X100. Immuno-fluorescence was performed to
detect the expression levels of LC3 (ATG8) and Beclin1 (ATG6).

treated with β-cyclodextrin or with CHAPS. Treatment
of cells with drugs followed by fixing and membrane
permeabilization with 10 mM β-cyclodextrin or 1% (w/v)
CHAPS did not alter the apparent observed decline in
HSP90, GRP78, HSP70 and HSP27 levels as determined
by immuno-fluorescence (data not shown). This data,
together with our detection data using antibodies raised
against different epitopes in the chaperone proteins
suggests that the tertiary structure of chaperone proteins
may be rapidly altered by OSU-03012. Moreover, these
data indicate that standard western blotting techniques
involving denaturation are not optimal for detailed studies
of how chaperone structure may vary in cells upon drug
exposure.
We next sought to determine whether other cellular
proteins, including those in the wider chaperone super-

family, interacted with OSU-03012. As a proteomics
collaborator was not available at Massey Cancer Center
we collaborated with colleagues at the NIH. At least four
chaperone family proteins were co-precipitated by OSU03012 (Figure 3A). Two protein kinases and two proteins
that regulate cellular redox status were also identified.
Based on these discoveries we performed additional
immuno-fluorescence studies to determine the impact of
OSU-03012 and of sorafenib on the expression and/or
phosphorylation and localization of these proteins. The
expression of the small chaperone HSP27, which lacks an
ATP binding site, was reduced by both OSU-03012 and by
sorafenib, with our immuno-fluorescence data in general
agreement with data generated via standard western
blotting (Figure 3B). Based on 60X magnification images
of the cells, HSP27 appeared to be both widely distributed

and HSP90, using antibodies that recognize epitopes in the NH2-terminus; COOH-terminus; and in the middle of the proteins, as well as
our previously utilized “usual” antibody. (C) Left: GBM5 cells were transfected with a scrambled siRNA molecule or siRNA molecules
to knock down the expression of BAG2, GRP75, HSP75, HSP27 or GRP78. Twenty four h after transfection cells were fixed in place and

in the cytosol and also in globular particulate formations
in vehicle treated cells, whereas drug treatments abolished
any particulate chaperone staining. In drug-dose-response
studies OSU-03012 at a concentration of 1 µM was able to
reduce HSP27 detection levels in three glioblastoma cell
isolates within 3 h (Figure 3C). Using antibodies raised
against different epitopes within HSP27 we observed that
treatment of cells with OSU-03012 reduced the immunofluorescence detection of HSP27 with an antibody that was
raised against full-length HSP27 protein, i.e. our “usual”
antibody; no precise epitope provided by the supplier, and
antibodies that recognize the central region of the protein,
i.e. amino acids 32–108, and a synthetic peptide raised
against the COOH-terminus of the protein (Figure 3D).
However, using an antibody specifically generated against
the NH2-terminus of the HSP27 protein, residues 2–12,
no apparent drug-induced alteration in the immunofluorescence signal was observed.

OSU-03012 and [OSU-03012 + sildenafil]
treatment very modestly enhanced the stoichiometry of
p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Figure 3E). OSU-03012
as a single agent increased the stoichiometry of HSP27
phosphorylation at Serine 15, but not at Serine 78 or
at Serine 82; i.e. total expression of HSP27 declined
whereas HSP27 phosphorylation did not alter, hence the
stoichiometry of HSP27 phosphorylation rose. Our data
also argues that Serine 78 phosphorylation declined after
sildenafil exposure. Of particular note were the side-byside comparisons of AKT Threonine 308 phosphorylation
and mTOR Serine 2448 phosphorylation. As we have
previously shown for AKT Threonine 308 phosphorylation
in these glioblastoma cells, OSU-03012 as a single agent
had little to no obvious effect on T308 phosphorylation
levels (Figure 3E). In contrast, OSU-03012 as a
single agent strongly reduced mTOR Serine 2448
phosphorylation. Thus our data argues that OSU-03012

plates, cells were fixed in place and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X100. Immuno-fluorescence was performed to detect the expression
level of HSP27 presented at 10X and 60X magnification; (b) cells were lysed with bromophenol blue buffer and subjected to SDS PAGE
followed by immuno-blotting to detect the expression level of HSP27. (C) GBM5, GBM6 and GBM12 cells were treated with vehicle,

Triton X100. Immuno-fluorescence was performed to detect the expression level of HSP27, using antibodies that recognize epitopes in
the NH2-terminus; COOH-terminus; and in the middle of the protein, as well as our previously used “usual” antibody. (E) GBM5 and

and the phosphorylation levels of AKT T308; p38 MAPK; mTOR S2448; HSP27 S15; HSP27 S78; and HSP27 S82.

causes a greater degree of mTOR dephosphorylation
when compared to its more modest effect on AKT
dephosphorylation, implying that the regulation of mTOR
activity by the drug is likely to be more biologically
important than that of AKT.
We next examined the other two chaperone proteins
shown to interact with OSU-03012 in Figure 3A; HSP75
and GRP75 (Figure 4A and 4B). The expression of both
HSP75 and GRP75 was reduced by treatment with OSU03012 or with sorafenib. Based on 60X magnification
images of the cells, HSP75 appeared to be both widely
distributed in the cytosol and also to have peri-nuclear
staining in vehicle treated cells, whereas drug treatments
abolished any peri-nuclear staining (Figure 4A and 4C).
BCL-2 associated athanogene (BAG) proteins are
chaperone regulator/adaptor molecules that compete
with the protein HIP for binding to the ATPase domain of
HSP70 family chaperones, including HSP70, and regulate
the trafficking of misfolded proteins to the proteasome or
to autophagy. In our proteomic studies the protein BAG2
associated with OSU-03012, and both OSU-03012 and
sorafenib reduced BAG2 protein expression (Figure 5A).
In addition, treatment of cells with OSU-03012 or
sorafenib altered the granular/punctate staining of BAG2
with its localization becoming more uniform. There are
two other members of the BAG family, BAG1 and BAG3.

Treatment of cells with OSU-03012 or sorafenib also
reduced BAG1 and BAG3 protein expression (Figure 5B
and 5C). The protein HSC70 interacting protein (HIP),
together with BAG proteins regulates the ATPase activity
and chaperone function of HSP70 family chaperones.
OSU-03012, but not sorafenib, reduced HIP expression
(Figure 5D).
In protein-protein co-localization studies, where
red staining overlapping green staining co-localizes to
generate a yellow fluorescent signal, we noted that OSU03012 reduced the co-localization of BAG2 and HSP70
and of HSP27 and HSP70 in GBM cells (reduced yellow
staining; increased individual green and red staining)
(Figure 6A and 6B). In a manner similar to the BAG
proteins and HIP for HSP70; the protein AhA1 regulates
the ATP loading of HSP90. Treatment of cells with OSU03012/sorafenib with or without sildenafil modestly
reduced the detection of AhA1 by immuno-fluorescence
(Figure 6C). In co-localization studies we noted that OSU03012 treatment reduced the co-localization of AhA1 and
HSP90 in GBM cells (reduced yellow staining; increased
green and red staining), with the AhA1 and HSP90
association in punctate bodies decreased by drug exposure
(Figure 6D).
HSP90 function, in addition to being regulated by
AhA1, is also controlled by the essential co-chaperone

CDC37. CDC37 facilitates HSP90 chaperoning of cyclin
dependent kinases, IκB kinases and eIF2α kinases, and
is itself phosphorylated on Serine 13 by casein kinase 2
[23, 24]. Serine 13 phosphorylation stabilizes CDC37 into
a more compact conformation with enhanced secondary
structure and in yeast models mutation of this site causes
severe growth deficiency and reduced expression of
multiple CDC37 client proteins. In co-localization studies
we noted that OSU-03012 after a 6h treatment reduced the
total expression and the co-localization of CDC37 with
HSP90 in GBM cells (reduced yellow staining; increased
green and red staining) (Figure 7A). Treatment of cells
with [OSU-03012 + sildenafil] or [pazopanib + sildenafil]
for 2 h did not alter total CDC37 expression but decreased
CDC37 Serine 13 phosphorylation levels (Figure 7B).
We then performed additional analyses on other
chaperone proteins, also at 60X magnification, to
determine whether the localization of the chaperone
in the cell was being altered following [OSU-03012
+ sildenafil] treatment. In vehicle treated glioma cells
HSP90 and GRP78 were localized in multiple small
punctate bodies, whose staining was markedly reduced
6h after [OSU-03012 + sildenafil] treatment (Figure 8A
and 8B). In contrast, HSP70 and HSP40 localization
was not altered by drug exposure (Figure 8C and 8D).

Mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHSP70) staining in vehicle
control cells exhibited a dense mackerel staining pattern as
would be expected for mitochondrial localization which
was dramatically altered after [OSU-03012 + sildenafil]
exposure such that mitochondrial HSP70 staining occurred
in very long vermiform projections (Figure 9A). In a
manner reminiscent of the staining for mitochondrial
HSP70, HSP60 and HSP10 protein staining also
became more diffuse and vermiform after [OSU-03012
+ sildenafil] exposure (Figure 9B and 9C). Very similar
chaperone immuno-fluorescence data have been recently
previously published by the Dent laboratory when treating
tumor cells with [sorafenib + sildenafil] [22].
We next determined whether sorafenib, pazopanib
and the sulfonamide analogue of OSU-03012 (AR-12),
called AR-13, also altered our ability to detect HSP90,
GRP78 and HSP27 by in situ immuno-fluorescence.
As was previously observed for OSU-03012, sorafenib/
pazopanib/AR-13 reduced the immuno-fluorescence
detection of HSP90, HSP70 and GSP78 using an NH2terminal specific antibody but not using antibodies
directed against epitopes in the middle and COOHterminal portions of the proteins (Figure 10). As a
single agent, regorafenib was ineffective at changing the
immuno-fluorescence detection of the NH2-termini of

HSP90, HSP70 or GRP78 (Figures 10 and 11A). Upon
examination of other chaperone proteins we also observed
that sorafenib and pazopanib could reduce the detection of
native proteins by immuno-fluorescence, an effect largely
not present in cells treated with regorafenib (Figure 11B).
In a dose-dependent fashion [OSU-03012 + sildenafil]
reduced the expression of HSPH1/p105 and a protein it
chaperones, c-MYC (Figure 12A). AR-13 and sildenafil
also reduced the total expression and co-localization of
p105 and c-MYC. In immuno-precipitates, [OSU-03012
+ sildenafil] reduced the co-precipitation of c-MYC with
p105 and of p105 with c-MYC (Figure 12B).
As heat shock proteins co-precipitated with OSU03012 in our proteomic studies, we investigated whether
OSU-03012 altered chaperone ATPase activity. We
transformed bacteria with a plasmid to make a GST fusion
protein of the NH2-terminal portion of HSP90; the domain
that contains the ATP binding site and ATPase activity of
the chaperone. Equal portions of the NH2-terminal portion
of HSP90 were subjected to ATPase activity analyses.
OSU-03012 reduced chaperone ATPase activity, as
measured on the isolated purified NH2-terminal HSP90GST protein fragment in vitro with an IC50 of ~200 nM

in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP substrate (Figure 13A).
Similar data were obtained with the multi-kinase inhibitor
sorafenib and with the multi-kinase inhibitor pazopanib,
but not the fluorinated analogue of sorafenib, regorafenib,
or the parent compound of OSU-03012, celecoxib.
Remarkably, AR-13 inhibited HSP90 chaperone ATPase
activity, with an IC50 of ~40 nM. We then expressed
tagged forms of HSP90 and HSP70 in eukaryotic cells,
with cells treated for 1h with either vehicle or sildenafil.
Equal portions of HSP90 and HSP70 were subjected to
ATPase activity analyses. We found that equal quantities
HSP90 and HSP70 proteins isolated using their engineered
tags from sildenafil treated cells unexpectedly had near
identical ATPase activities than those from vehicle control
treated cells (Figure 13B and 13C). As was previously
observed for bacterial expressed HSP90 ATPase activity;
the ATPase activities of eukaryotic synthesized HSP90
and HSP70 were also inhibited by OSU-03012, sorafenib
and pazopanib; but were not inhibited by regorafenib.
For OSU-03012, sildenafil enhanced its inhibitory effects
against both the HSP90 and HSP70 ATPase activities.
For sorafenib, sildenafil enhanced its inhibitory effects
against both the HSP90 and HSP70 ATPase activities.

For pazopanib, sildenafil did not further enhance its
potent inhibition of the HSP90 ATPase but did enhance
its inhibitory effect against the HSP70 ATPase. Pazopanib
was a more potent inhibitor of the HSP90 ATPase activity
than sorafenib whereas sorafenib was a more potent
inhibitor of the HSP70 ATPase activity than pazopanib. For
regorafenib, sildenafil did not enhance its HSP90 ATPase
inhibitory activity but did enhance its inhibitory properties
against the HSP70 ATPase. Perhaps most interestingly,
the novel analogue AR-13 inhibited the ATPase activities
associated with the HSP90 and the HSP70 chaperone
complexes more efficaciously than it did the bacterial
synthesized NH2-terminal portion of HSP90.
Based on the fact that sorafenib and pazopanib are
well-known to be multi-S/T/Y kinase inhibitors we wished
to prove or refute whether other tyrosine kinase inhibitors
of disparate structures could also inhibit chaperone
ATPase activities. Neither the second generation
ERBB1/2/4 suicide inhibitor afatinib nor the Janus kinase
1 and 2 inhibitor ruxolitinib could inhibit the ATPase
activities associated with HSP90 or HSP70 (Figure 14A).
Nevertheless, treatment of cells with [ruxolitinib +
afatinib] combined for 6 h did reduce the detection
by in situ immuno-fluorescence of the NH2-termini of
HSP90 and HSP70 (Figure 14B). These findings argue
that ruxolitinib and afatinib may (somehow) interact with
HSP90 and HSP70 so as to alter the tertiary conformation
of their NH2-termini without impacting on chaperone
ATPase function. i.e. conformation change and ATPase
inhibition effects may be separate events.

In parallel sets of immuno-precipitates from cells
expressing only endogenous levels of HSP90, GRP78 and
HSP70 we determined whether OSU-03012, sorafenib,
pazopanib or AR-13 could alter the composition of coprecipitating chaperone and other associated proteins. The
amount of HSP90, HSP27 and BAG2 in HSP70 immunoprecipitates was reduced by OSU-03012 (Figure S1A).
The amount of PERK and WASF3 in GRP78 immunoprecipitates was reduced by OSU-03012. The amount
of AhA1 in HSP90 immuno-precipitates was reduced
by OSU-03012. Of particular note, less HSP70 coprecipitated with HSP90 in the presence of OSU-03012
that was also associated with reduced HSP70 mobility
on SDS PAGE, an effect usually indicative of increased
protein phosphorylation. Similar effects were observed
when HSP27 was co-precipitated with HSP90, with
HSP27 showing reduced SDS PAGE mobility in cells
treated with OSU-03012 again suggestive of increased
phosphorylation. In cells treated with pazopanib or with
AR-13 immuno-precipitation of HSP90, GRP78, HSP70
or HSP27 revealed that the levels of co-precipitating
HSP90, GRP78, HSP70 or HSP27 was considerably
reduced by each drug (Figure S1B and S1C).
We next determined the impact of OSU-03012 on
the elution profile from a gel filtration column of native
chaperone protein complex. As a traditional protein
biochemist was not available at Massey Cancer Center, we
collaborated with a colleague in Australia. HeLa cells were
pre-treated for 20 min with OSU-03012 then lysed, and
clarified lysates subjected to gel filtration in the presence

of vehicle control or OSU-03012. Treatment of cell lysates
with OSU-03012 resulted in the chaperone protein HSP27
eluting in lower molecular weight complexes compared
to the chaperone elution in vehicle control treated lysates
(Figure S2). n.b. there also appeared to be less overall detection of the HSP27 protein itself following gel
filtration after OSU-03012 treatment compared to vehicle
control, with very similar blotting detection level for the
protein loading controls on each piece of nitrocellulose.
As a molecular modeling in silico collaborator was
not available at Massey Cancer Center we performed
studies with colleagues at Augusta University. In the
absence of crystallographic or spectroscopic data, docking,
using Autodock Vina, was done to predict the binding mode
of OSU-03012 to HSP90 [16–31] (Figure S3A–S3C).
Docking of OSU-03012 against an ensemble of structures
derived by molecular dynamics (NAMD 2.10) from the
high-resolution structure of the NH2-terminal domain of
human HSP90 in complex with the ATP analog ACP (PDB
ref code 3T10) yields two plausible poses. In the first pose,
the purine binding pocket is filled by the phenanthroline
group of OSU-03012, with the long axis oriented parallel
to the surface of the protein. There is also a hydrophobic
interaction between the CF3 group and the aromatic ring
of Tyr139. The protonated amino group in the sidechain
interacts with several hydrophilic residues in the α-helix
flanking the ATP binding site, either Ser50 or Asp54. In
the second pose the long axis of the phenanthroline group

is oriented orthogonal to the protein surface. The CF3
group makes a hydrophobic contact with the sidechain of
Ile110, and the amino group shows similar interactions
between Ser50 or Asp54 as in the first pose.
To understand why treatment of cells with OSU03012 resulted in reduced immuno-detection of the NH2terminal domain of HSP90 we performed accelerated MD
of the complex between HSP90 (NH2-terminal domain
only) and OSU-03012. Starting from the first pose, within
a short span of simulated time (30 ns) the phenanthroline
group flips to an orthogonal orientation to adopt the
second pose. The amino group is seen to interact with
several other residues besides Ser50 and Asp54, notably
Asp102. A similar simulation was done with apo-HSP90.
Comparing between the conformations the protein is seen
to adopt with and without ligand, it can be seen that while
the conformation of the β-sheets at the back of the ATP
binding pocket remains nearly unchanged, the positions
of the α-helices are very different. We also determined the
distance groups of the OSU-03012 ligand and residues of
HSP90 from the MD simulation. In Figure S3D we present
data showing the distances between the amino group of
OSU-03012 and residues S50, D54 and D102 of HSP90.
In Figure S3E we present data showing the distances
between the trifluoromethyl group of OSU-03012 and
residues I110 and Y138 of HSP90. These structural
alterations may account for the differences in chaperone
reactivity using antibodies with NH2-terminal epitopes.

We next determined whether OSU-03012 could
dock into HSP70. The nucleotide-bound structure of
HSP70 is tightly closed, but there are structures of HSP70
in complex with nucleotide exchange factors, where the
subdomains are enveloping the ADP less tightly. We
applied artificial forces to the model to move the atoms
to match a target structure, and we did the docking along
the way from the starting structure to the target. The most
plausible pose is attached; Figure S4A, and is just from the
docking. The data presented in Figure S4B has the ATP
super-imposed.  The phenanthrene group of OSU-03012
is in the nucleotide binding pocked (the arginine residues
in this pocket may form cation-pi interactions), the -CF3
group forms hydrophobic interactions with one of the two
tyrosine residues nearby, and the amino group in the sidechain interacts with the serine residues that would bind to
the phosphate groups of ATP.
We have published several manuscripts
demonstrating that low concentrations of OSU-03012
(AR-12) kills tumor cells, and that this effect is enhanced
by the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil. Based on our prior
studies in this manuscript, we next determined the relative
potency side-by-side of tumor cell killing by OSU-03012
and by AR-13. (Figure S5). AR-13 and OSU-03012
had similar dose-dependent abilities to kill GBM6 and
GBM12 cells. However, when combined with sildenafil,
AR-13 was significantly more capable of causing tumor
cell death than OSU-03012, with concentrations as low as
100 nM causing > 50% tumor cell death. Thus, we next

determined whether our drug treatments altered chaperone
– chaperone co-localization in cells in situ using antibodies
for detection whose signal did not show alterations
in signal strength after drug exposure. Regorafenib,
sorafenib, pazopanib, AR-13 and OSU-03012 reduced
the interactions between HSP70 and HSP27; HSP60 and
HSP10; and GRP78 and GRP94 (Figure S6). Regorafenib
did not alter the co-localization of HSP90 and HSP70.
Sorafenib, pazopanib, AR-13 and OSU-03012 all modified
the interaction between HSP90 and HSP70 reducing the
numbers of punctate sites of co-localization as well as
increasing sites of punctate staining that were green or red,
not co-localized yellow.
In Figure 3A we demonstrated that two protein
kinases associated with OSU-03012; ULK-1 and PLK4.
The protein kinase ULK-1 is considered to be an essential
gate-keeper kinase for the regulation of autophagosome
formation, and whose activity is negatively regulated by
Serine 757 phosphorylation by the kinase mTOR [32, 33].
This is of particular interest to us as we know that
induction of a toxic form of autophagy plays a central role
in OSU-03012 lethality. OSU-03012 or sorafenib reduced
the phosphorylation of mTOR at Serine 2448, indicative of
mTOR inactivation (Figure S7A). Reduced mTOR S2448
phosphorylation correlated with reduced phosphorylation
of ULK-1 at an accepted site of mTOR phosphorylation,
Serine 757, as well as appearing to reduce the total
expression of ULK-1 protein, which collectively in
turn correlated with increased phosphorylation of the

autophagosome formation regulatory protein ATG13 at
Serine 318 [33–35].
Serine 318 phosphorylation of ATG13 facilitates,
together with other protein-protein interaction events,
autophagosome formation. When we examined cells
at 60X magnification to determine the localization of
ULK-1 and ULK-1 S757 phospho-protein we noted a
strong peri-nuclear localization and phosphorylation
of ULK-1 (Figure S7B). Drug treatments, particularly
those containing OSU-03012, demonstrated a marked
reduction in the peri-nuclear staining of both ULK1 and ULK-1 S757. Downstream of ULK-1 we also
explored the impact of our drug treatments at 60X on
the localization and phosphorylation of ATGATG13
S318. In vehicle or drug treated cells ATG13 protein
was detected throughout the cell (Figure S7C).
Drug treatments, particularly those containing OSU-03012,
increased the levels of peri-nuclear staining ULK-1 S757
concomitant with observation of increased and more
intense punctate staining of phospho-ATG13 S318; the
punctate staining was reminiscent of autophagosome
vesicles detected using expression of an LC3-GFP protein.
Transfection of GBM12 cells to express GRP78 both
reduced basal phosphorylation levels and prevented the
drug-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α and ATG13,
but did not prevent drug-induced dephosphorylation of
mTOR (Figure S7D). Transfection of GBM12 cells to
express HSP27 prevented OSU-03012/sorafenib single
agent -induced phosphorylation of eIF2α and ATG13, and
prevented the OSU-03012/sorafenib single agent -induced
dephosphorylation of mTOR (Figure S7D).

We next performed immuno-fluorescence protein
co-localization studies to determine whether phosphoATG13 S318 or HSP27 / GRP78 / HSP90 co-localized
with the autophagosome vesicle protein LC3 (ATG8) after
drug exposure. Treatment of GBM5 and GBM12 cells for
3 h with OSU-03012 or [OSU-03012 + sildenafil] caused
phospho-ATG13 S318 or HSP27 to co-localize with LC3
in punctate bodies (Figure S8A). Treatment of GBM5
and GBM12 cells for 3h with OSU-03012 or [OSU03012 + sildenafil] caused GRP78 to co-localize with the
autophagosome vesicle marker protein LC3 (Figure S8B).
In contrast, HSP90 and LC3 did not co-associate prior
to or after drug exposure. Thus we conclude it is the
combined dysregulation of both GRP78 and HSP27
that is required for drug-induced promotion of the toxic
autophagy signal.
In addition to ULK-1, another protein kinase was
detected in our mass spectrometry proteomic screen; Pololike kinase 4 (PLK4). PLK4 is localized in the nucleus
where it is thought to regulate centriole biology within
centrosomes during DNA synthesis. PLK4 interacts with
the kinase BuBR1 which is localized in the kinetochore
and BuBR1 associates with the scaffold protein BUB3
which collectively regulate the mitotic spindle checkpoint.
Treatment of cells with OSU-03012 or sorafenib, with or
without sildenafil, did not significantly alter PLK4, BUB3
or BuBR1 expression (data not shown).
Our screen identified several proteins involved
in reactive oxygen species detoxification: peroredoxin
and thioredoxin. Thioredoxin is a well-known client of
HSP90 and is also known to associate with peroredoxin,

using antibodies that recognize epitopes in the NH2-terminus; COOH-terminus; and in the middle of the proteins.

presumably in a large chaperone complex [36–38]. HSP27
maintains thioredoxin reductase expression activity which
is vital to maintain thioredoxin as a reactive oxygen species
detoxification enzyme. Treatment of cells with drugs
modestly reduced the levels of peroredoxin (Figure S9A).
Treatment of cells with OSU-03012 or with sildenafil
(which generates both ROS and RNS) strongly lowered
thioredoxin expression. Prior studies from our group have
shown that agents which quench reactive oxygen species
levels, such as N-acetyl cysteine, reduce the ability of
OSU-03012 to kill tumor cells. Transfection of GBM cells
with a plasmid to express a wild type thioredoxin protein
suppressed the induction of reactive oxygen species caused
by OSU-03012 treatment, and transfection to express a
mutant inactive form of the protein caused a prolonged
high level of ROS (Figure S9B). Forty eight hours after
drug treatment, over-expression of thioredoxin had
suppressed OSU-03012 killing whereas over-expression
of the mutant protein strongly promoted drug-induced
cell death (Figure S9C). Over-expression of HSP27 or of
GRP78, maintained thioredoxin expression in the face of
both drug combination treatments (Figure S9D).
We over-expressed chaperone proteins and
determined their relative impact on the ability of our drug
combinations to induce tumor cell death over 24 h. Overexpression of HSP90, GRP78 or of [GRP78 + HSP27]
or of [HSP70 + HSP27] significantly protected tumor
cells from exposure to the toxic drug combinations
(Figure S10A). Over-expression of all chaperones, alone
or in combination, to some extent maintained expression

of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and TRX after drug combination
exposure (Figure S10B). Thus by inhibiting the functions
of multiple chaperones our drug combinations reduce the
expression of multiple cyto-protective proteins (TRX,
c-FLIP-s, MCL-1, BCL-XL); facilitate the inactivation of
cyto-protective signaling pathways (mTOR); and facilitate
the activation of cyto-toxic pathways (PERK-eIF2α).

DISCUSSION
At present OSU-03012 ( AR-12) has obtained
the orphan designation for cryptoccosis and tularaemia
in Europe, and the licensee of OSU-03012, Arno
Therapeutics, has entered into a cooperative research
and development agreement with the US Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases for AR-12.
Ourselves and others have shown that OSU-03012
(AR-12) has anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in
many model systems as well as having anti-viral and
anti-bacterial properties against organisms as diverse as
Mumps, Measles, Influenza, Ebola, Marburg, and panantibiotic resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhea and
Klebsiella pneumoniae. Indeed, over the last 10 years
we have published multiple manuscripts detailing the
cellular targets of OSU-03012 (AR-12). The “big-picture”
conclusions we had previously made concerning the
biology of the drug prior to the present manuscript were
that OSU-03012 (AR-12) kills tumor cells selectively
over non-transformed cells and does so by primarily
inactivating and down-regulating the chaperone GRP78

which causes a prolonged intense endoplasmic reticulum
stress response leading to high levels of autophagy flux,
mitochondrial dysfunction and an apparent necroptotic
form of tumor cell death.
The present studies extend our knowledge to
encompass proteomic analyses of AR-12 interacting
proteins, demonstrating that multiple other chaperones
and chaperone regulatory proteins interact with the drug
in a manner which permits drug-dependent precipitation
of those proteins. The most notable novel chaperone found
to associate with AR-12, albeit indirectly due to its lack
of a purine binding domain, and explain its mechanism
of action, was HSP27. AR-12 was originally proposed
to exhibit anti-tumor activity through inhibition of the
enzyme PDK-1 within the PI3K pathway, a mechanism
which we largely disproved in 2005 and 2006. In 2014
and earlier in 2015 we proposed that one reason AR-12
may have been thought to be a PDK-1 inhibitor was
because cell surface GRP78 had been shown to play
an intimate role in maintaining PI3K / PDK-1/AKT
activity, and we discovered that AR-12 very rapidly

caused breakdown of cell surface GRP78 [39–42]. Our
present data demonstrating AR-12 mediated reductions
in HSP27 expression and changes in its localization,
including in autophagosomes, further strengthens this
argument as several groups have shown that HSP27
plays a key chaperone function in facilitating PI3K/AKT
activation, which in turn provides a potent downstream
anti-apoptotic signal in its own right, and through mTOR
an anti-autophagy signal [43, 44]. That AR-12 targets
multiple chaperone proteins whose clients play essential
roles in maintaining anti-apoptotic signaling through
the PI3K pathway strongly supports the use of AR-12 at
the very least as a cancer therapeutic index modulator to
enhance the effectiveness of standard of care therapies,
and in the case of our data, glioblastoma multiforme. Prior
studies from the Dent laboratory have demonstrated in
PDX orthotopic animal models of GBM that OSU-03012
can prolong animal survival and radio-sensitize tumors
resulting in a further prolongation of survival [6].
The role of HSP27 in the regulation of other PI3K
pathway regulated processes also connects our prior

to determine the co-precipitation of HSPH1/p105 with c-MYC and of c-MYC with HSPH1/p105.

studies with AR-12 to the new data in this manuscript
[43–50]. As GRP78 and HSP27 both act to maintain PI3K
/ AKT signaling they also could be thought to very likely
play a key role in the regulation of the PI3K-regulated
kinase mTOR. Our present data strongly argues that
regulation of mTOR function by HSP27 may be of greater
importance from a therapeutic standpoint than modulation
of AKT. Under conditions of nutrient surplus or growth
factor stimulation mTOR is active and both enhances cell
proliferation and mobility but also suppresses catabolic
processes such as macro-autophagy through inhibitory
phosphorylation of ULK-1 (known as ATG-1 in yeast). We
noted that AR-12 reduced the phosphorylation of mTOR
at S2448, to a much greater extent than that of AKT
T308, indicative of reduced mTOR kinase activity, which
correlated with reduced phosphorylation of the inhibitory
mTOR phosphorylation site in ULK-1, Serine 757. ULK-1
activation concomitant with Serine 757 dephosphorylation
was demonstrated by increased ATG13 phosphorylation

at Serine 318, a site known to be targeted by ULK-1.
Thus combined loss of GRP78 and HSP27 facilitates
a reduction in mTOR activity which in turn promotes
ULK-1 –dependent ATG13 phosphorylation and hence
autophagosome formation.
In previous work we had linked AR-12 effects at
increasing autophagosome formation to reduced GRP78
expression and in parallel the activation of PERK and
elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling. In
transformed rodent fibroblasts, AR-12 increased the
expression of Beclin1 and LC3 in a PERK dependent
manner, in general agreement with the present data in
human tumor cells showing that dominant negative eIF2
alpha also suppressed AR-12 –induced expression of the
autophagy regulatory, and autophagy facilitating proteins,
Beclin1 and LC3. Furthermore, in this manuscript we
demonstrated that AR-12 causes the co-localization of

Figure 13: Sildenafil enhances the ATPase inhibitory effects of regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, AR-13 and OSU03012. (A) A GST-HSP90 NH2-terminal fragment containing the ATP binding domain of the chaperone was synthesized in E. coli and

purified from other bacterial proteins using glutathione sepharose. The GST-HSP90 NH2-terminal fragment protein was not eluted off the
sepharose beads. Equal portions of beads were immediately aliquoted into individual wells in a 96 well plate. Beads were resuspended
in kinase reaction buffer containing vehicle control; OSU-03012; sorafenib tosylate; regorafenib; pazopanib; AR-13; celecoxib (30 nM;
100 nM; 300 nM; 1 µM) in triplicate, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was started by addition of ATP-lite substrate. The
plate was removed from the incubator and placed into a Vector 3 plate reader to determine the luminescence of the reactions under each
treatment condition (n = 3 (× 3) +/− SEM). (B and C) GBM12 cells were transfected with a plasmid to express HSP70-GFP or to express
FLAG-tagged HSP90. Twenty four h after transfection cells were treated with vehicle control or sildenafil (2 µM) for 1 h. Chaperone
proteins were immuno-precipitated using their tags in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Equal portions of precipitate sepharose beads
were immediately aliquoted into individual wells in a 96 well plate. Beads were resuspended in ATPase reaction buffer containing vehicle
control; OSU-03012; sorafenib tosylate; regorafenib; pazopanib; AR-13; (30 nM; 100 nM; 300 nM; 1 µM) in triplicate, and incubated for
30 min at 37°C. The reaction was started by addition of ATP-lite substrate. The plate was removed from the incubator and placed into a

previous work and the present studies argue that by
modulating the function of the chaperones GRP78 and
HSP27, regardless of the many other chaperones we also
now know are effected by the drug, AR-12 promotes toxic
autophagosome formation in tumor cells through two
distinct mechanisms and thus this is why the catabolic
process is associated with OSU-03012 –induced cell death.
HSP27 biology is also regulated by protein
phosphorylation, with the p38 MAPK pathway causing
increased phosphorylation at Serine 15, Serine 78 and
Serine 82 in the chaperone [43–50]. Others have shown
these modifications lead to the basal state high molecular
weight oligomer complexes of HSP27 (> 700 kDa)
disassociating into low molecular weight tetramers
and dimers (~ 50 kDa) [45]. In the present studies
we discovered that AR-12 caused the high molecular
weight HSP27 complexes visible at 60X magnification
to dissociate, which correlated with only modest levels
of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and increased HSP27
phosphorylation at Serine 15, but not at Serine 78, and
marginally at Serine 82 only in GBM12 cells. It is known
that Serine to Aspartic acid phospho-mimicking HSP27
mutants have a decreased oligomer size, enhanced
chaperone activity with in parallel an elevated binding
capability of destabilized lysozyme. Very recent data
from Jovcevski et al. has also demonstrated that the
HSP27-S15D and HSP27-S78D/S82D proteins form

large disperse complexes when compared with wild type
HSP27, with a shift toward smaller oligomeric species
[45]. The chaperoning activity of all single HSP27
mutants was equivalent in the assays of Jovceski et al,
as was the case for the double HSP27 mutant proteins,
arguing that no single phospho-serine residue has a
predominant role in regulating the chaperone activity of
HSP27. i.e. the cumulative acquisition of one, then two,
then three phosphorylations regulates the degree of HSP27
oligomerization. Thus through both p38 MAPK signaling,
as well as through a more direct interaction through
HSP70 detected through proteomics and co-immunoprecipitation, AR-12 modulates HSP27 biology.
Our data sets determining chaperone expression
levels using immuno-fluorescence and western blotting
were very often discordant. This was in contrast to our data
with non-chaperone proteins that bound ATP and could
hydrolyze ATP, i.e. ERK2 and JNK1. The expression and
localization of nuclear localized PLK-4 and its chaperones
was not altered by AR-12 or sorafenib. One possibility
we explored for our data set differences was that upon
treatment of cells with AR-12 (or sorafenib) chaperones
were becoming localized inside vesicles that could not
be solubilized with a 0.5% solution of Triton X100.
Thus we performed studies using the complex former
β-cyclodextrin, which additionally solubilizes Triton X100
resistant sphingolipid membranes, as well as with CHAPS,

Figure 14: Afatinib nor ruxolitinib have ATPase inhibitory effects against HSP90 or HSP70. (A) GBM12 cells were

transfected with a plasmid to express HSP70-GFP or to express FLAG-tagged HSP90. Twenty four h after transfection chaperone proteins
were immuno-precipitated using their tags. Equal portions of precipitate sepharose beads were immediately aliquoted into individual wells
in a 96 well plate. Beads were resuspended in ATPase reaction buffer containing vehicle control; ruxolitinib; or afatinib (500 nM; 1000 nM;
1500 nM; 2 µM) in triplicate, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was started by addition of ATP-lite substrate. The plate was
removed from the incubator and placed into a Vector 3 plate reader to determine the luminescence of the reactions under each treatment
condition (n = 3 (× 3) +/− SEM). (B) GBM12 cells were treated with vehicle or [afatinib (1 µM) and ruxolitinib (1 µM)] for 6 h. Cells were
fixed in place and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X100. Immuno-fluorescence was performed to detect the expression levels of HSP70
and of HSP90 using antibodies raised to detect the NH2-termini and COOH termini of the proteins.

a detergent used when lysing cells and isolating the active
conformations of the BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)
proteins BAX and BAK. Neither detergent altered the
immuno-fluorescence staining pattern of chaperones that
was observed when using Triton X100. This argues against
the hypothesis that OSU-03012 –induced localization
changes into locations that prevent immuno-detection are
occurring.
More obviously, when using antibodies raised
against epitopes in different portions of HSP90, HSP70,
HSP27 and GRP78 we also observed discordant data,
using immuno-fluorescence detection. Antibodies raised
against the ATP-binding NH2-terminal domains of
HSP90, HSP70 and GRP78 demonstrated that OSU-03012
treatment reduced immuno-fluorescence detection whereas
those antibodies raised against central and COOHterminal epitopes remained constant or exhibited more
modest declines in detection. Our data using bacterial
and eukaryotic expressed chaperones also strongly
argued that OSU-03012 was interacting with chaperone
proteins through the ATP binding site within their ATPase
domain. At this point it is also important to consider
additional proteomic data, where a number of other ATP,
GTP and nucleotide binding proteins were identified in
our proteomic screen using OSU-03012, though notably
not PDK-1 (Figure S11). Some of the proteins listed in
Figure S11 are known to have chaperone partners, such
as HSP90 and RAS proteins [51]. That so many proteins
in the proteomic screen with AR-12 either bind ATP/
GTP/nucleotides, together with our in silico docking data,
tends to argue that AR-12 is able to interact with some
conserved structural portion of a purine binding site n.b.
no pyrimidine specific binding protein was identified.
Thus our present findings suggest that AR-12 treatment
modifies the tertiary structure of ATP binding chaperones
to such an extent that NH2-terminal antibody recognition
epitopes become lost when examining the native protein
and only become available for detection again after boiling
in SDS and detection by western blot.
The chemical structures of OSU-03012 (AR-12);
celecoxib; sorafenib; regorafenib; pazopanib; and AR-13
are presented in Figure S12, alongside those of guanosine,
adenosine, cytidine, thymidine and uridine. That the
inclusion of a single fluorine atom in sorafenib, which results
in the drug regorafenib, should so significantly reduce the
HSP90 ATPase inhibiting effect of the drug argues that the
additional fluorine atom either induces a steric clash or alters
the conformation of the ring system so much as to prevent
chaperone association. Our initial exploratory ATPase
studies used OSU-03012, sorafenib and regorafenib. To
our surprise we then discovered that pazopanib was a more
potent ATPase inhibitor than OSU-03012, whereas celecoxib
was found to be a very poor ATPase inhibitor. When we
compared the structures of OSU-03012, its parent drug
celecoxib, sorafenib and pazopanib we noted that sorafenib,
OSU-03012 and pazopanib all contained complex extended
long ring structures including nitrogen atoms in the ring
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

systems, as observed for nucleotides (dashed green circles).
Both pazopanib and celecoxib contain sulfone moieties
(dashed red circles). Thus a priori to any experiment we
predicted, based on its structure including portions of the
other ATPase inhibitors that the novel compound AR-13
would be an HSP90 ATPase inhibitor. We subsequently
discovered that AR-13 was significantly more potent at
inhibiting chaperone ATPase activity than either pazopanib
or OSU-03012. AR-13 is, in essence, the drug celecoxib
with a phenanthrene group in place of the p-tolyl group.
(dashed purple circles). As AR-13 is a significantly better
HSP90 and HSP70 ATPase inhibitor than celecoxib we thus
conclude that the phenanthrene system in AR-12 and in
AR-13 is essential for their enhanced biological activities
toward HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone ATPase activities
compared to their parent compound celecoxib.
As our studies were nearing completion a molecular
modeling group in India published computer generated
structures of OSU-03012 interacting with the ATPase sites
of GRP78 and HSP70 [52]. These studies focused on polar
hydrogen bonding interactions between OSU-03012 and the
chaperone proteins, ignoring any hydrophobic interaction
through the phenanthrene group. Based on the modeled
energies of association/dissociation of OSU-03012 with
the chaperones these authors concluded that OSU-03012
would not alter the conformation of the HSP70 or GRP78
chaperone proteins. Our data examining the NH2, middle and
COOH portions of HSP90 shows that this chaperone does
alter its 3-dimensional structure, of the NH2-terminus, in
response to OSU-03012 exposure, and our data comparing
the ATPase inhibitory effects of our compounds localized the
long hydrophobic three ring C6 structure as a key molecular
motif for chaperone inhibition. Based on in silico docking
studies we found that OSU-03012 could associate with the
HSP90 hydrophobic purine pockets of these chaperones.
Studies beyond the remit of this manuscript will be required
to fully model the association of AR-12 with purine binding
sites in chaperone and other proteins.

live/dead assay reagent added and cells incubated for 10
min before the reagent was removed. Cells were imaged
in a Hermes WiScan instrument under 10× magnification.
Green cells = viable; yellow/red cells = dying/dead. The

Methods

Preparation of biotin-AR-12

Protein detection

The strategy used to covalently link biotin to AR-12
exploited structure-activity relationships established by
the Chen laboratory. Briefly, a biotin-linker arm conjugate
(NHS-PEG12-biotin) was added to a region of the
compound that was not associated with biological activity;
its relatively long length was selected to minimize potential
interference with the compound’s active sites.
The linker arm has this structure:

Proteomic/mass spectrometry procedures

Cell treatments, SDS-PAGE and Western
blot analysis. Cells were treated with various drug
concentrations, as indicated in the figure legends. SDSPAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described
in references [6–9]. For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting,
cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/cm2 and treated with
drugs at the indicated concentrations and after the
indicated time of treatment, lysed in whole-cell lysis
buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol,
1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue), and the
samples were boiled for 30 minutes. The boiled samples
were loaded onto 10–14% SDS-PAGE and electrophoresis
was run overnight (10–100 μg/lane based on the gel size).
Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto 0.22-μm
nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with various primary
antibodies against different proteins. Antibodies used
include: HSP90 (E289) (Cell Signaling); HSP90 (#2928)
(Abcam); HSP90 (ab195575) Abcam; HSP90 3G3 (13495)

with pre-equilibrated Glutathione Sepharose 4B (2 ml of
a 50% Sepharose slurry is mixed with 100 ml of clarified
bacterial sonicate). The Sepharose slurry was gently
rotated in a cold room for 30 min. The slurry mixture was
centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min) and the supernatant
discarded. The Glutathione Sepharose was washed with
10 bead volumes of 1X PBS. The Sepharose slurry was
centrifuged (5,000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant
discarded. The Sepharose beads were washed three times.
Chaperone ATPase activity using the ATPlite 1step kit
(PerkinElmer) was determined using GST-NH2 terminal
HSP90 still linked to the Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads.
The Sepharose beads were equilibrated in the reaction
buffer provided by the manufacturer for 30 min with
gentle mixing, and the beads recovered by centrifugation.
The beads were then resuspended 1:1 with reaction buffer.
To each well of a 96 well plate was added 50 µl of bead
slurry and 50 µl of substrate buffer solution containing
vehicle control or drug to achieve the desired final drug
concentrations. The reactions were started using a multichannel pipette delivering 50 µl of reconstituted reagent to
each well. The plate was placed in foil in an orbital shaker
at 37°C for 15 min. The plate was removed, centrifuged
to remove floating Sepharose beads, and 100 µl of the
supernatant from each well placed into a new well in
another 96 well plate. The light emitted from each well/
treatment condition was quantified using a Vector 3 plate
reader (n = 3 of three studies +/− SEM).

Cultured SKBR3 HER2+ human mammary
carcinoma cells were extracted after 24 h in serum
free medium with ice cold buffer containing non-ionic
detergent (Triton X100), protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Lysates were cleared of insoluble material
by centrifugation. Supernatants were “pre-cleared” of
molecules that bind non-specifically to streptavidin
(SA) coated beads by incubating with SA-beads for 30
min at 4°C and subsequently removing the beads by
centrifugation. Supernatant samples resulting from this
step were then incubated with biotin-AR-12 in the presence
or absence of excess AR-12 for 2 h at 4°C. SA-beads
were then added for an additional 2 h at 4°C before capture
by centrifugation, repeated washing with non-ionic
detergent buffer and extraction with boiling Laemmli SDSPAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDSPAGE and bands were visualized using Ponceau S. Bands
present in the biotin-AR-12 samples that were not found
in the samples incubated with excess unlabeled AR-12
were excised from the gel, rinsed to remove Ponceau S
and digested with trypsin. Eluted tryptic peptides were
separated by nanotrap- and C18-column HPLC coupled
to online analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nLCESI-MS/MS) on an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped
with a nanospray ion source using conventional techniques
(Laboratory of Proteomic and Analytical Technologies,
Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research,
National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). The resulting
MS/MS spectra were searched against the human IPI
database to derive probable peptide amino acid sequence,
protein/gene identities and statistical confidence values
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

Assessment of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species
generation
GBM12 cells were transfected with empty vector
(CMV) or with plasmids to express wild type thioredoxin
(TRX) or a mutant inactive thioredoxin (mTRX), and
24 h after transfection cells were re-plated into 96-well
plates. Cells were treated with 1 µM OSU-03012 for the
indicated periods. Fifteen minutes before isolation, cells
were incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (dihydro-DCF; Invitrogen) (5 μM), which is
non-fluorescent in its dihydro form but upon reaction with
reactive oxygen (ROS)/nitrogen species becomes highly
fluorescent. Dihydro-DCF is sensitive to oxidation by
hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite directly and hydrogen
peroxide in the presence of a peroxidase. Fluorescence
measurements were obtained 15 min after OSU-03012
addition with a Vector 3 plate reader. Data are presented
corrected for baseline fluorescence of dye at each time
point. Each time point represents the mean of six data
points.

Isolation of GST-NH2 terminal HSP90 from
bacteria and the measurement of its ATPase
activity
E. coli BL21 [F–, ompT, hsdS (rB, mB ), gal] were
transformed with a plasmid to express a fusion protein of
the NH2-terminal portion of HSP90 fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) (purchased from Addgene). Bacteria
were grown at 24°C with shaking until the A600 reached
0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM
and the incubation continued for an additional 6 hours.
Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation and stored on
ice. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of ice-cold
1X PBS per ml of culture. The re-suspended cells were
mechanically disrupted using a probe sonicator, on ice,
in short 5 second bursts. Triton X-100 was added to a
final concentration of 1% (v/v) followed by 30 minutes
of gentle shaking to aid in solubilization of the fusion
protein. Bacterial debris and denatured proteins were
removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.
The supernatant was removed and immediately mixed

Gel filtration of HeLa cell lysates
HeLa cells were grown in 25 cm2 flasks were
exposed to AR-12 or sorafenib (both, 5 µM) or DMSO
control for 20 mins. Media was removed and cells washed
with PBS containing 5 µM of drug (or equivalent volume

of DMSO) two times. Cells were lysed with 1% Triton
X-100 in PBS containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Pierce) and 5 µM of drug or equivalent volume
of DMSO as a control. Samples were vortexed and then
incubated at 4°C for 30 mins on ice. Samples were
centrifuged (20,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C) and supernatants
collected and stored at 4°C until they were subjected to gel
filtration. A Superdex 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) was
pre-equilibrated with buffer (PBS) containing 5 µM drug
or equivalent volume of DMSO at 0.5 ml/min. 200 μg
of total protein was loaded onto the column (100 µl of
sample) and proteins eluted with buffer at 0.5 ml/min.
Fractions of 1 ml were collected as they eluted from the
column. Those fractions containing protein (8–23) were
collected and initially stored on ice. To each fraction, 250 µl
of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added to a final
concentration of 10% (w/v) to precipitate the proteins;
each fraction was mixed vigorously and then incubated on
ice overnight. Samples were then centrifuged (20,000 × g,
20 min, 4°C), the supernatant discarded and the protein
pellet washed twice with cold acetone followed each time
by additional centrifugations. Samples were then left to
air-dry prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

Molecular dynamics
The model system for HSP90 was built using
VMD. For the model, the coordinates of human HSP90
in complex with ACP (PDB refcode 3T10) were used.
The protein was inserted into a cubic water box of size
80 * 80 * 80 Å3. The whole system consisted of
47971 atoms. For MD simulations, NAMD 2.10 was
used. Ligand and protein were restrained to their
original positions and the system was equilibrated at
constant temperature and pressure (300 K, 1 atm, NPT
ensemble) for 0.5 ns. Simulations were done using
the CHARMM36 force-field in combination with
the CGenFF forcefield where needed. Then 5 ns of
production MD was performed. Docking (Autodock
Vina) was done against conformations extracted from
this run. Initial CGenFF-compatible parameters for
the AR-12 were derived using the CGenFF website
and subsequently optimized. Subsequently, 50 ns of
accelerated MD with Generalized Born Implicit Solvent
(GBIS) for both HSP90 in complex with AR-12 and apoHSP90 was performed [25–41].
