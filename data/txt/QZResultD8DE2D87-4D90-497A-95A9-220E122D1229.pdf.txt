ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic, has been used as an anti-neoplastic drug for
almost 60 years. However, the mechanism(s) by which anthracyclines cause irreversible
myocardial injury remains unclear. In order to delineate possible molecular signals involved
in the myocardial toxicity, we assessed candidate genes using mRNA expression profiling
in the doxorubicin-treated rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cell line. In the study, it was confirmed
that myogenin, an important transcriptional factor for muscle terminal differentiation, was
significantly reduced by doxorubicin in a dose-dependent manner using both RT-PCR and
western blot analyses. Also, it was identified that the doxorubicin-reduced myogenin gene
level could not be rescued by most cardio-protectants. Furthermore, it was demonstrated
how the signaling of the decreased myogenin expression by doxorubicin was altered
at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels. Based on these
findings, a working model was proposed for relieving doxorubicin-associated myocardial
toxicity by down-regulating miR-328 expression and increasing voltage-gated calcium
channel β1 expression, which is a repressor of myogenin gene regulation. In summary,
this study provides several lines of evidence indicating that myogenin is the target for
doxorubicin-induced cardio-toxicity and a novel therapeutic strategy for doxorubicin
clinical applications based on the regulatory mechanisms of myogenin expression.

topoisomerase 2β (Top 2β) is identified as the primary
mediator for the anthracycline-induced toxic effects on
cardiac myocytes [5, 6], the pathogenic mechanisms
responsible for anthracycline cardio-toxicity have not
been fully elucidated. In a rare situation, the onset of
cardio-toxicity may be delayed as many as 10–15 years
after the cessation of chemotherapy.
Despite the predominant role of reactive oxidative
species (ROS) in DXR-induced cardio-toxicity is certain,
many of potential protectants do not appear to affect the

INTRODUCTION
Doxorubicin (DXR), an anthracycline antibiotic
from Streptomyces peucetius, has been used as an
anti-neoplastic drug for almost 60 years to treat several
solid tumors and malignant hematological diseases [1].
Its therapeutic use to gain more wild acceptance has
been hampered by toxicities, such as hematopoietic
suppression, nausea, vomiting, extravasation and
alopecia, yet the most feared cardio-toxicity [2–4]. While

production of free radicals but rather alter the cellular
response to ROS [7–9]. Because no biomarker during
DXR chemotherapy has been validated as a surrogate
end point for clinically important cardiovascular disease,
there is no effective approach that fully prevents or even
treats DXR-associated cardio-toxicity. Presently, the
measurement of cardiac enzymes or humoral factors,
such as troponin I and T and B-type natriuretic peptide,
are supplementary to detect early signs of DXR-induced
cardio-toxicity, as they are not specific for DXR-induced
damage. Thus, there remains an urgent need for methods
to detect early signs of cardiac deterioration or subsequent
cardiovascular events related to DXR treatment.
The use of cardio-protective drugs is an alternative
approach to reduce the cardio-toxicity of DXR. However,
the pharmacological and clinical attempts of cardioprotective drugs to reduce the cardio-toxicity of DXR
have had little success. Thus far, dexrazoxane is the only
approved drug co-administered with DXR for preventing
DXR-induced cardiac damage. Its mechanisms of action
involve to chelate free iron, to displace iron from DXRiron complexes, or to prevent DXR from binding to
the topisomerase 2β complex [6, 10]. Recently, many
compounds including carvedilol, dexamethasone,
resveratrol and berberine have been reported to possess
cardio-protective activities [11–14]. But, it is still
uncertain whether these drugs are useful for DXR toxicity.

properties of skeletal muscle [16]. H9c2 cells cultured
in lower serum conditions and/or treated with atRA
(retinoic acid) differentiate from myoblasts into myotubes
[17]. Here, we first induced H9C2 cell differentiation by
reducing the serum concentration to 1% or combination
with atRA. We then observed the morphological changes.
The cell morphology changed into a spindle shape
with 1% FBS or the combined condition (Figure 1a).
The differentiation status was examined in the S phase
population and confirmed the significant decrease of this
phase using flow-cytometry analysis (data not shown).
We further collected the total RNAs and then analyzed
the mRNA expression profiling using the Rat OneArray
method (Phalanx Biotech Group, Taiwan, ROC). In this
analysis, we found that 1% FBS significantly induced
troponin I and myogenin, and atRA further induced
MLC 2v and Myo D1 (Figure 1b). We reconfirmed
the differentiation status of H9c2 cells, including
myogenin, MLC-2v and Oct-4 [18–20], and the selected
mRNAs expression profiling using the RT-PCR analysis
(Figure 1c).
We further analyzed the effect of DXR on the
mRNA expression levels of our selected genes, including
myogenin, using the Rat OneArray method (Figure 2a).
The myogenin and Myo D1 mRNAs were reduced when
the concentration of DXR was increased, which was
confirmed by the RT-PCR analysis (Figure 2a and 2b).
The dose-dependent effects of DXR on p53, p21 and
DNA damage (γH2A.x) proteins were consistent with
previous studies [21]. The abundance of the myogenin
protein was consistently and significantly suppressed by
DXR treatment (Figure 2c). We found that the abundance
of p53 proteins was increased by DXR, possibly,
mediated through the ubiquitin-dependent stability [22],
whereas this was inconsistent with its mRNA expression
trend. The switch from autophagy (LC3II) to apoptosis
(cleaved PARP) was observed for the higher DXR
concentration.

While a variety of mechanisms are involved in
anthracycline cardio-toxicity, it is important to develop
a resembling cell-based model to study DXR-induced
cardio-toxicity in vitro. Although H9c2 cells lack the
typical organization and dense packing of adult cardiomyocytes [15, 16], they share some characteristics of
differentiated cardiac cells. In the study, mRNA array
profiling and H9c2 cell model were used to identify
myogenin as a primary protein responded to DXR
treatment. The reductive effect of DXR on myogenin
expression was investigated at transcriptional, p
­osttranscriptional, translational and post-translational levels
to depict the molecular signaling of DXR toxicity. Since
the decreased micro RNA-328 (miR-328) expression may
play a role in DXR-induced cardio-toxicity, a potential
model for the protection of DXR-induced cardiotoxicity via repression of miR-328 mediated CACNb1
(voltage-gated calcium channel β1)-dependent myogenin
gene expression was proposed.

Cardio-protective drugs do not prevent the
decrease in myogenin expression caused by DXR
Although the use of cardio-protective drugs is an
alternative approach to reduce the cardio-toxicity of DXR,
pharmacological and clinical attempts to reduce the cardiotoxicity of DXR have had little success thus far [5, 6, 12].
Isoproterenol (ISO) is a non-selective beta-adrenergic
agonist used for the treatment of bradycardia and heart
block. Phenylephrine (PE) is a selective α1-adrenergic
receptor agonist used primarily as a decongestant, as
an agent to dilate the pupil and as an agent to increase
blood pressure. ISO and PE may relieve DXR-induced
cardio-toxicity. In addition, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a
precursor in the formation of the antioxidant glutathione in
the body, and its thiol group confers antioxidant effects and
is able to reduce free radicals. We used NAC to examine

the effect of free radicals on the decreased myogenin
expression because of the primary role of ROS in DXRinduced cardio-toxicity. Here, we treated H9c2 cells with
10 μM ISO, 10 μM PE and 1 mM NAC based on our
dose-course results (data not shown) and then analyzed
the effects on myogenin expression. ISO and PE, but not
NAC, increased the abundance of the myogenin protein,
but not the mRNA (Figure 3a and 3b, compare lanes 1, 4,
7 and 10). PE prevented the decrease in myogenin protein
caused by the lower concentration of DXR, whereas ISO
did not (Figure 3b). NAC potentiated the effect of DXRdependent myogenin protein repression, but enhanced the
effects on the cyclin B1, ATF3, cleaved PARP and γH2A.x
proteins (Figure 3b and data not shown). We observed that
NAC potentiated the subG1 population induced by 1 μM
DXR and reduced the population in S phase (Figure 3c).
The reduction of the S phase population was also observed
when H9c2 cells were treated with ISO and PE.

Act D inhibits transcription because it binds DNA
at the transcription initiation complex and prevents the
elongation of the RNA chain by RNA polymerase [23].
CHX is a de novo protein biosynthesis inhibitor and
exerts its effect by interfering with the translocation step
in protein synthesis, thus blocking translational elongation
[24]. Act D and CHX were used to elucidate the effect
of DXR on the transcriptional stage or/and translational
stage (Figure 4). Here, Act D was useful to determine the
mRNA stability of the selected genes. The p53 and control
GAPDH mRNAs were stable; however, the majority of
the mRNAs were labile, particularly MyoD1 and p21
(Figure 4a). The suppression effect of DXR on myogenin
mRNA was alleviated in with Act D treatment. The Act

protein expression levels were consistent with the effect
of Act D at the transcriptional stage (Figure 4b). Higher
concentrations of DXR also had similar Act D effects on
the p53 gene and protein. The decrease of the myogenin
gene and protein by DXR were prevented by Act D,
suggesting that the regulatory mechanism is primarily
at the transcriptional stage. We found that the myogenin
protein was unstable. The p53 and p21 proteins were also
unstable when the H9c2 cells were treated with CHX. Our
flow cytometry analysis was consistent with the so-called
DXR dose effect, such that a lower dose (0.1 μg) induced
G2/M and a higher dose (0.5 μg) induced apoptosis
(Figure 4c, vehicle). For the combination of DXR with
Act D or CHX, higher amounts of DXR predominantly
determined the cell cycle at the G1, S and G2/M phases
(Figure 4c). Based on the subG1 population, Act D
induced apoptosis and suppressed higher amounts of

DXR-induced apoptosis. CHX reduced apoptosis in H9c2
cells, with or without the addition of DXR (Figure 4c).
We constructed an expression vector for myogenin
to investigate the regulatory mechanism of DXR. First, our
data demonstrated that myogenin localized to the nucleus
via the EGFP expression vector and DXR had no apparent
effect on its subcellular localization (Figure 5a). Next,
we transiently transfected the indicated serial amount of
HA-fused myogenin and examined the decreased effect
of DXR on the exogenous myogenin mRNA and protein
in H9c2 cells. Our data demonstrated that exogenous
myogenin mRNAs were dose-dependent, and DXR
selectively depleted the endogenous myogenin mRNA, but
not the exogenous myogenin mRNA (Figure 5b, compare
lanes 1 and 7 in 18 cycles of PCR). Therefore, we further
determined whether DXR directly suppresses myogenin
promoter activity. Our data show that DXR did repress the

manner (Figure 5c).
In contrast to the effect on the transcriptional level
(Figure 5b), DXR depleted the endogenous and exogenous
myogenin proteins (Figure 6a). We further verified the
protein degradation pathway of DXR-induced myogenin
using the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in H9c2 cells.
The myogenin and p53 proteins were more stable in

the pretreated MG132-H9c2 cells (Figure 6b, compare
lanes 4–6 to lanes 1–3). DXR significantly decreased
the myogenin proteins, but MG132 partially prevented
this decrease (Figure 6b, compare lanes 4–6 to 10–12),
suggesting that DXR may down-regulate myogenin proteins
via mechanisms other than the proteasome-degradation
pathway. In addition, the stabilization of p53 proteins was
observed for the MG132 and DXR treatment conditions,

[25]. Our myogenin promoter reporter assays were
consistent with the suppressive effect of Twist proteins
on this promoter activity in H9c2 cells (Figure 7a).
Our western blotting data further demonstrated that
overexpressing Twist decreased the level of myogenin
protein and its effect on the myogenin promoter activity
(Figure 7b). If Twist proteins are involved in the repression
of myogenin in the presence of DXR, then the expression

should increase with DXR treatment. Our data showed
that the level of the Twist protein was decreased after the
depletion of myogenin proteins in DXR-treated H9c2 cells
(Figure 7c, lane 4), and the p53 protein was induced at this
point. We knocked-down the myogenin gene to examine
the relationship between myogenin and Twist. Our data
demonstrated that the endogenous myogenin protein
reduced the abundance of the Twist protein (Figure 7d).
Because Twist proteins do not play an important role
in the decreased myogenin expression caused by DXR,
we further examined other potential candidates involved
in this process. MiR-186, HuR and CACNb1 may
mediate myogenin expression through different pathways
[26–28]. Here, we first analyzed the miR profile using
the rat miR OneArray kit and found 22 up-regulated and
17 down-regulated miRNAs for 1 μM DXR compared
to the vehicle treatment (Table 1). Unfortunately, we did
not identify miR-186. The 22 up-regulated miRNAs were
not involved in myogenin mRNA stability or translation.
Next, we examined the effect of DXR on HuR protein

expression, which remained constant levels (Figure 8a,
left panel). In contrast, exogenously overexpressed HuR
significantly decreased the abundance of the myogenin
protein (Figure 8b, compare lanes 1 and 2). Recently,
Dr. Delbono’s laboratory demonstrated that CACNb1
suppresses myogenin gene expression in mouse progenitor
cells [28]. However, we demonstrated that DXR or
exogenously overexpressed HuR proteins did not increase
the abundance of the CACNb1 proteins.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies support the effector role of many
myogenic transcriptional factors, including Myo D1, in
DXR-induced cardio-toxicity [29, 30]. However, these
myogenic transcriptional factors are mainly involved
during the early stage. Myo D1 and myogenin have distinct
regulatory roles at a similar set of target genes. Myogenin
activity is a pivot point for the irreversible commitment to
terminal differentiation. For these late genes, myogenin

does not bind efficiently without Myo D1; however,
transcriptional activation requires the combined activity of
Myo D1 and myogenin. Therefore, the role of myogenin
in mediating terminal differentiation is, in part, to enhance
the expression of a subset of genes previously initiated by
Myo D1. Recently, studies from Dr. Phylactou’s laboratory
reveal an important role for myogenin in maintaining
terminal muscle cell differentiation and suggest a novel
mechanism by which muscle cells may be reactivated
through its down-regulation [31]. Here, our study is the
first to demonstrate that DXR modulates the myogenin
gene mediated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional,
translational and post-translational levels. In addition,
several miRs were also modulated by DXR based on
our miRNA analysis profile (Table 1), such as miR-328.
A study by Dr. Yang’s laboratory revealed that CACNb1
was the target of miR-328, which was suppressed by
DXR [32], and Dr. Delbono’s laboratory demonstrated
that CACNb1 suppresses myogenin gene expression in
mouse progenitor cells [28]. We subsequently proposed
the possible involvement of CACNb1 via the suppression
of miR-328 expression to down-regulate myogenin gene
expression in rat cardio-myocytes. The functional role
of HuR in myogenin regulation will be further addressed
because of the significant reduction of the myogenin
protein by exogenous HuR (Figure 8b). This further
understanding of the target of DXR-induced cardiotoxicity will help us to identify cardio-protective agents.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The mechanism of action of DXR is dependent
on its concentration and remains a matter of debate
[33, 34]. Our current results in cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells
were consistent with previous studies demonstrating
that at the senescence-inducing concentration (0.1 μM),
DXR induced more DNA damage, as measured by
phosphorylation of γ-H2A.X, (0.5 μM) than at the
apoptosis-inducing concentration (1 μM) in human
cervical carcinoma cells or other cells. The expression
level of p21 correlates with the activation by p53 at low
DXR concentrations, but not at high concentrations.
ROS has a predominant role in DXR-induced cardiotoxicity and the only FDA-approved free iron chelator is
dexrazoxane [35]. NAC did not prevent the decrease in
myogenin gene and protein expression caused by DXR
in this study. Many studies suggest that ROS and iron
become toxic as a result of reactions that extend beyond
canonical oxidative damage [36, 37]. Therefore, it is to
characterize the relationship between ROS and myogenin
expression upon DXR treatment.
Myogenin is essential during differentiation [20, 29].
Downregulation of endogenous myogenin gene expression
in muscle cells can lead to the reversal of muscle cell
differentiation and the creation of mononucleated cells.
MyoD and Myf5 are unable to substitute for the function
of myogenin during differentiation [30]. There are many
factors involved in the regulation of myogenin gene
expression, such as HuR, Twist, CACNb1, miR-186
37452

and miR-328 [25–28, 32]. The mechanisms involved in
myogenin reduction during heart failure are not completely
understood. In cell culture, myogenin expression is
suppressed in differentiating myocytes treated with tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a cytokine that commonly
increases during heart failure. Additionally, TNF-α is
a major inducer of chronic inflammation and ROS and
is abundant under conditions of chronic inflammation.
A recent study by Dr. Baba’s laboratory demonstrated
that miR-328 expression was markedly suppressed in
gastric cancer cells treated with H2O2, but not TNF-α
[38]. Combined with these findings, the suppression of
myogenin by TNF-αis either independent of the miR328-CACNb1 signaling in myocytes or the selectivity of
the miR-328 target depends on the cell-type. However,
the suppression of miR-328 by ROS is not the primary
mechanism because NAC did not affect the abundance of
myogenin in this study.
DXR induced cardiomyocyte atrophy, which
was alleviated by the proteasome inhibitor, MG132,
indicating a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome system
in DXR-induced atrophy [3, 39]. Our data indicate that
MG132 prevent the DXR induced decrease in myogenin
protein in H9c2 cells, suggesting that myogenin may
play a role in DXR-induced atrophy. Recent studies
demonstrate that Twist and miR-168 both suppress
myogenin gene expression [25, 27]. In this study, the
involvement of Twist and miR-168 in the DXR-induced
myogenin decrease in H9c2 cells was ruled out. However,
Dr. Yang’s laboratory showed that CACNb1 is the
target of miR-328, and Dr. Delbono’s laboratory further
demonstrated that CACNb1 suppresses myogenin gene
expression mediated through the binding of CACNb1 to
the myogenin promoter in mouse progenitor cells [28, 32].
In addition, a recent study demonstrates modulation of
the L-type calcium channel expression during retinoic
acid-induced differentiation of H9c2 cells [17]. Therefore,
we will have the chance to correlate the linkage of
miR-328-dependent CACNB1 signaling with the depletion
of myogenin proteins to determine the mechanism of
DXR-induced cardio-toxicity in the future.
The discovery of widespread functions of miRs has
increased the complexity of gene-regulatory processes
and networks, in both the cardiovascular system and
cardiovascular diseases [40]. Mechanistically, miRs
regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level
at the 3′-UTR by inhibiting the translation of protein
from the mRNA or by promoting the degradation of
mRNA. One of the challenges for the future use of
miR-based therapies arises from the fact that many
miRs modulate multiple target genes (100 or more)
involved in multiple cellular processes. Although the
repressive effects of any individual miR on a single
target might be subtle, the combinatorial effects of a
miR on multiple mRNA targets within a regulatory
network can profoundly change the output of a pathway.

Using the TargetScan website to predict human miR-328
targets, human myogenin was identified as a potential
target; however, rat myogenin is not its target because
of its distinctive 3′-UTR sequences, GGGCCAA and
GGGCAA (data not shown). Dr. Yang demonstrated that
CACNB1 was a target for miR-328, but there was no
supporting data from the TargetScan analysis. Here, we
propose that the DXR-induced decrease of myogenin is
mediated through transcriptional repression by CACNb1,
which is induced by the downregulation of miR-328 by
DXR in rat cardiomyocytes. It is important to elucidate
the detailed regulatory mechanism of miR-328 and its
targets under various pathophysiological conditions, such
as atrial fibrillation.
In summary, the results of this study identify
myogenin as a new DXR-induced cardio-toxicity
target and indicate that it is transcriptionally, posttranscriptionally, translationally, and post-translationally
regulated. Furthermore, HuR and miR-328-dependent
CACNB1 signaling are potentially involved in the
depletion of the myogenin gene and protein by DXR in
rat cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the regulation of myogenin
expression may represent a novel therapeutic target for
DXR clinical applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and chemicals
H9c2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% or 1%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen, CA, USA). All-trans retinoic acid (atRA),
DXR, actinomycin D (Act D), cycloheximide (CHX),
isoproterenol (ISO), phenylephrine (PE) and N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(MO, USA).

Messenger RNA and miRNA expression profiling
Total RNAs were extracted from H9c2 cells using
the TRIsure (Bioline Reagents, London, UK) reagent and
were was sent to the Phalanx Biotech Group (HsinChu,
Taiwan, ROC) for their mRNA expression profiling service
using the Rat OneArray method and for their miRNA
expression profiling service using the Mouse and Rat miRNA
OneArray. The RNA quantity and purity was assessed using
a NanoDrop ND-1000. The pass criteria for the absorbance
ratios are established at A260/A280 ≥ 1.8 and A260/A230
≥ 1.5, indicating acceptable RNA purity. The RIN values
were ascertained using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano assay
to determine the RNA integrity. The pass criteria for the
RIN value were established at ≥6, indicating acceptable
RNA integrity. gDNA contamination was evaluated by gel
electrophoresis. The data analysis was performed with the
Rosetta Resolver® System (Rosetta Biosoftware, WA, USA).

individual total proteins because the renilla internal
control system was downregulated by DXR and Twist
in H9c2 cells. The luciferase activities are shown as the
mean and deviation from the mean of two transfected
sets as previously described [41].

Myogenin was constructed by inserting the fulllength PCR fragments into the pSG5.HA and pEGFP
vectors via the EcoRI-XhoI and EcoRI-SalI restriction
sites, respectively. Twist and HuR were constructed by
inserting the full-length PCR fragments into the pSG5.
HA vector via the EcoRI-XhoI restriction sites. The
reporter myogenin(−2000/+33)-LUC was constructed by
inserting the appropriate PCR fragments into the pGL3LUC reporter plasmid via the KpnI-XhoI restriction
sites. The cells in each well (6- or 24-well plate) were
transfected with jetPEI (PolyPlus-transfection, Illkirch,
France) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
total DNA was adjusted to 2.0 μg (6-well) or 1.0 μg
(24-well) with the addition of empty pSG5.HA vector.
