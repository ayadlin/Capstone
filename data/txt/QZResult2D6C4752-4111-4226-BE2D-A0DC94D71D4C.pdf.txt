ABSTRACT
Bradykinin is a well-known endogenous vasoactive peptide. The present study
investigated the bradykinin receptor expression in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor
cells and the potential role of bradykinin in regulating cell cycling progression and
mobility. It was found that mRNA and protein of bradykinin type 2 receptors, but
not bradykinin type 1 receptors, were abundant in cultured human cardiac c-Kit+
progenitor cells. Bradykinin (1-10 nM) stimulated cell growth and migration in a
concentration-dependent manner. The increase of cell proliferation was related to
promoting G0/G1 transition into G2/M and S phase. Western blots revealed that
bradykinin significantly increased pAkt and pERK1/2 as well as cyclin D1, which
were countered by HOE140 (an antagonist of bradykinin type 2 receptors) or by
silencing bradykinin type 2 receptors. The increase of pAkt, pERK1/2 and cyclin D1
by bradykinin was prevented by the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002, the PLC inhibitors
U73122 and neomycin, and/or the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine and the MAPK inhibitor
PD98059. Our results demonstrate the novel information that bradykinin promotes
cell cycling progression and migration in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells via
activating PI3K, PLC, PKC, cyclin D1, pERK1/2, and pAkt.

INTRODUCTION

through the activation of the two types of bradykinin
receptors, B1Rs and B2Rs [10]. Previous studies have
demonstrated that bradykinin increases cell proliferation
in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells [11], canine
corneal epithelial cells [12], rabbit corneal fibroblasts [13],
rat aortic vascular smooth cells, and amoeboid migration
of cancer cells [14]. Bradykinin has been reported to be
cardioprotective [15-17]; however, it is unknown whether
cell cycling progression and migration of cardiac c-Kit+
progenitor cells are involved in bradykinin-induced
cardioprotection. The present study was therefore
designed to determine the expression of bradykinin
receptors in cultured human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor
cells and to investigate whether/how cell growth and
mobility are regulated by bradykinin. Our results showed
that B2Rs, but not B1Rs, were present in human cardiac
c-Kit+ progenitor cells. Bradykinin enhanced cell cycling
progression and migration by increasing cyclin D1, pAkt
and pERK1/2 via activating B2Rs.

Cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells can potentially
differentiate into at least three main cardiac cells, i.e.
myocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial
cells [1], and are therefore believed to be a viable cell
source of cell-based therapeutic strategy for treating
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in animal models
[2-4] and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy [5-8].
It is generally recognized that stem cells from implanted
or residential source must migrate to the injured site
before they can proliferate then differentiate into cardiac
myocytes and/or endothelial cells to repair the damaged
myocardial tissue [9]. Therefore, proliferation and
migration of cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells are essential
in myocardial repair. However, regulation of cell cycling
progression and migration is not fully understood in
human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells.
Bradykinin is a principal active agent of tissue
kinin-kallikrein system and exerts its major effects

cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells

Effects of bradykinin on cell cycling progression
in human cardiac c-kit+ progenitor cells

Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein of B1Rs
and B2Rs were determined in human cardiac c-Kit+
progenitor cells using RT-PCR and Western blotting
analysis, respectively. Figure 1A shows that mRNA
expression of B2Rs, but not B1Rs, was present in human
cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells. Protein expression of
B2Rs was confirmed with Western blot analysis. As
controls, mRNAs and proteins of both B1Rs and B2Rs
were expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
treated with interleukin 1β (IL-1β) 1 ng/ml for 24 h. These

Figure 1B shows images of cultured human cardiac
c-Kit+ progenitor cells in the absence and presence
of bradykinin or bradykinin plus the B2R antagonist
HOE140. The cell density was clearly increased with
bradykinin (3 and 10 nM) incubation (48 h), but not
with bradykinin plus HOE140 (30 nM), suggesting that
bradykinin may stimulate cell proliferation in human
cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells.
The effects of bradykinin on cell proliferation and
cell cycling progression were further analyzed. Figure 1C

shows the percentage of cell proliferation determined with
MTT method in the presence of different concentrations
of bradykinin. Bradykinin at 0.3 -10 nM (48 h incubation)
increased cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent
manner. Significant proliferation enhancement was
observed at 1, 3 and 10 nM (n = 6, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01
vs. control), and the effect was reversed by the B2R
antagonist HOE140 (P < 0.05 vs. 10 nM bradykinin), and
the effect was time-dependent (Figure 1D).
The effect of bradykinin on proliferation of human
cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells was confirmed by BrdU
incorporation assay (Figure 2A). BrdU positive cells were
increased with bradykinin incubation. Figure 2B shows
that cell number with BrdU positive nuclei was increased
by bradykinin at 0.3-10 nM. The cells with BrdU positive
nuclei were 29.8% in control, and increased to 40.6%
with 10 nM bradykinin (n = 6, P < 0.01), and the effect
was countered by co-application of the B2Rs antagonist
HOE140 (30 nM, n = 6, P < 0.01 vs. bradykinin).
The effect of bradykinin on cell cycle progression
was determined with flow cytometry in human c-Kit+
progenitor cells. Figure 2C shows the representative
flow cytometry graphs with cell cycle distribution in
cells treated with vehicle (control), 10 nM bradykinin,
and bradykinin plus 30 nM HOE140 for 48 h. The
number of cells in G0/G1 phase was reduced, while the
number of cells in G2/M and S-phase were increased by

bradykinin and the effects were reversed in cells treated
with both bradykinin and HOE140. Figure 2D illustrates
the percentage of cycling progression phases in cells
treated with vehicle or 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 nM bradykinin
or 10 nM bradykinin plus 30 nM HOE140. Bradykinin
reduced the proportion of cells at G0/G1 boundary in a
concentration-dependent manner. The proportion of G0/
G1 boundary was decreased from 79.6±0.6% in control to
71.5±1.5% in cells treated with 10 nM bradykinin (n = 6,
P < 0.01 vs. control), while the cell proportion of S-phase
was increased from 10.8±0.6% in control to 14.5±1.3 %
(P < 0.05 vs. control). These effects were reversed by the
B2R antagonist HOE140 (P < 0.01 vs. 10 nM bradykinin).
These results suggest that bradykinin enhances the
proliferation of human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells via
activating B2Rs by promoting the G0/G1 boundary to S
phase.

Effect of bradykinin on migration of human
cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells
To determine whether bradykinin increases cell
migration in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells, wound
healing and chemotaxis assays were conducted in cells
treated with different concentrations of bradykinin. Figure
3A shows the wound healing images in cells treated with
vehicle, 10 nM bradykinin or the B2R antagonist HOE140

cells is illustrated in Figure 3D. The cell migration, as in
wound-healing assay, was increased by bradykinin in a

regulation of cell cycling progression and
migration

c-Kit+ progenitor cells.
The effects of bradykinin on cell migration were
determined with wound healing assay (Figure 6A and 6B)
and transwell assay (Figure 6C and 6D) in cells transfected
with 40 nM B2R siRNA molecules. Cells migration to the
acellular area or the lower membrane surface of transwell
was increased by bradykinin in human cardiac c-Kit+
progenitor cells transfected with control siRNA (P <
0.01), but not in cells transfected with B2R siRNA. These
results indicate that cell migration induced by bradykinin
is mediated by B2Rs in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor
cells.

To determine the signal molecules involved in
bradykinin regulation of cell cycling progression and
migration, the molecules related to cell mobility and cell
cycling progression were determined in human cardiac
c-Kit+ progenitor cells. Figure 7 illustrates the Western
blot analysis for the survival kinase pAkt, the mitogenactivated protein kinase pERK1/2, and the cell cyclingrelated proteins cyclin D1 and cyclin E in human cardiac

c-Kit+ progenitor cells treated with different concentrations
of bradykinin. It is interesting to note that pAkt (Ser473),
pERK1/2, and cyclin D1, but not cyclin E were increased
by bradykinin in a concentration-dependent manner. The
increase of these kinases by bradykinin was fully reversed
in cells treated with the B2R antagonist HOE140 (n = 3,
P < 0.01 vs. bradykinin alone). These results suggest that
activation of pAkt, pERK1/2 and cyclin D1 are involved
in regulation of cell proliferation and/or migration by
bradykinin via activating B2Rs.
The signal molecular involvement of bradykinin
in increasing cell proliferation and migration was
further determined in cells transfected with B2R siRNA
molecules. Figure 8 shows that bradykinin-induced
increase of pAkt, pERK1/2 and cyclin D1 was seen in
cells transfected with control siRNA (n = 3, P < 0.01 vs.
control), but not in cells transfected with B2R siRNA.
These results confirm that bradykinin simulation of cell

proliferation and migration is mediated by B2Rs followed
by activation of pAkt, pERK1/2 and cyclin D1.
It has been reported that PLC, PI3K, PKC, and
MAPK kinase mediate the activation of pAkt, pERK1/2
and/or cyclin D [18-21]. To investigate whether this
is the case in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells,
we determined the effects of bradykinin on pAkt,
pERK1/2 and cyclin D in cells treated with the PLC
inhibitors U73122 (5 µM) and neomycin (50 µM), the
PI3K antagonist LY294002 (10 µM), the PKC inhibitor
chelerythrine (2 µM), and the MAPK kinase inhibitor
PD98059 (10 µM). Figure 9 illustrates the effects of these
inhibitors/antagonists on pAkt, pERK1/2 or cyclin D1
in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells treated with 10
nM bradykinin. The increase of pAkt by bradykinin was
reduced by U73122, neomycin and LY294002, but not
chelerythrine or PD98059 (Figure 9A), while bradykinininduced increase of pERK1/2 (Figure 9B) and cyclin

D1 (Figure 9C) was decreased by U73122, neomycin,
LY294002, chelerythrine or PD98059. These results
suggest that PLC and PI3K are involved in bradykinininduced increase of pAkt, and PLC, PI3K, PKC, and
MAPK kinase are involved in the increase of pERK1/2
and cyclin D1 by bradykinin.
The effect of signaling inhibitors on cell
proliferation was confirmed in human cardiac c-Kit+
progenitor cells. Figure 9D illustrates the percent changes
in cell proliferation induced by bradykinin in the absence

µM PD98059. The bradykinin-induced proliferation was
fully countered in cells treated with U73122, neomycin,
LY294002, chelerythrine or PD98059. These results
further support the notion that PLC, PI3K, PKC, and

conditioning, and therefore exerts cardioprotection against
ischemia/reperfusion injury [17, 32]. It is believed that
bradykinin acts as an endogenous protective factor that
reduces infarct size and improves post-ischemic contractile
function [15, 33]. However, little is known about the role
of bradykinin in long-term cardiac repair and myocardial
remodeling after myocardial ischemia and/or ischemia/
reperfusion injury. In this study, we found that bradykinin
increased cell cycling progression by promoting G0/
G1 boundary cells to S phase, and also stimulated cell
migration in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells.
The effects were inhibited in cells with treatment of the
B2R antagonist HOE140 or with B2Rs silenced. These
results indicate that bradykinin-induced increase of cell
cycling progression and migration of cardiac c-Kit+
progenitor cells is mediated by B2Rs; however, whether
this may participate in long-term myocardial repair and/
or remodeling remains to be studied in vivo in the future.
Earlier studies demonstrated that bradykinin
displays a wide range of biological activities in different
tissues, including regulation of mitogenesis in several
cell types [34]. The mitogenic effect of bradykinin
mediated by G protein-coupled B2Rs involving MEK/
MAPK is observed in epithelial breast cancer cells
[35], bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells [36], and also
human renal carcinoma A498 cells [37]. Bradykinin acts
as a proliferative agent in MCF-7 cells by activating
intracellular pathways including PKC, pAkt and
pERK1/2 [38]. In this study, we demonstrated in cultured
human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells that bradykinininduced increase of pAkt can be decreased by the PLC
inhibitors U73122 and neomycin and the PI3K antagonist
LY294002; the increase of pERK1/2 and cyclin D1 can be
prevented by U73122, neomycin, LY294002, and the PKC
inhibitor chelerythrine and the MAPK kinase inhibitor
PD98059, which supports the notion that the activation
of PI3K, PLC, PKC, MAPK, pAkt and/or pERK1/2 and
cyclin D1 are involved in bradykinin-induced increase of
cell cycling progression and mobility in human cardiac
c-Kit+ progenitor cells.
Collectively, the present study demonstrates the
novel information that bradykinin has mitogenic and
mobility effects in human c-Kit+ progenitor cells via
activating B2Rs. The activation of the G-protein-coupled
receptors B2Rs promotes cell cycling progression and
migration by activating PI3K, PLC, PKC, MAPK,
followed by the elevation of pAkt and/or pERK1/2 and
cyclin D1 levels. However, how bradykinin-mediated B2R
activation mediates these pathways and their correlation
remains to be further elucidated in the future.

DISCUSSION
It is generally recognized that bradykinin is
generated by the kinin-kallikrein system. In the plasma
bradykinin is produced by activating hageman factor
(Factor XII), then converting prekallikrein into kallikrein
to cleave high molecular weight kininogen to release the
kinin. It is also produced locally within tissues during
insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or acute
inflammation where kininogen is cleaved by cellular
proteases (chymase, tryptase, etc.) of mast cells and
basophils to liberate bradykinin [22, 23]. Bradykinin is
rapidly degraded by endopeptidases, mainly angiotensin
converting enzymes carboxypeptidase N and neutral
endopeptidase, inside the tissues [24]. Bradykinin exerts
its physiological effects via two types of G-protein
coupled receptors known as B1Rs and B2Rs [25]. B2Rs
are widely expressed in the heart, brain and spinal cord
tissues while the inducible B1Rs are mainly expressed in
these organs/tissues under pathophysiological conditions
[26, 27]. In the present study, we demonstrated that B2Rs,
but not B1Rs (which are expressed in IL-1β-stimulated
human umbilical vein endothelial cells), are constitutively
expressed in human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells.
Human cardiac progenitor/stem cells are a potential
cell source for myocardial repair/regeneration in patients
with ischemic cardiomyopathy [5-8]. However, the
cellular biology/physiology of these cells is not fully
understood. Our previous studies reported ion channel
expression and their roles in regulating cell proliferation
and migration [28-30]. In this study, we demonstrated that
bradykinin also mediates proliferation and migration of
human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells via activating B2Rs.
Bradykinin increases the heart tolerance for
myocardial ischemia by activating B2Rs [31]. The
increasing evidence suggests that bradykinin mediates
the ischemic postconditioning and remote ischemic

was amplified by a DNA thermal cycler (Mycycler, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in a 25-μL reaction
mixture containing recommended concentrations of PCR
components. The amplification was performed under the
following conditions: the mixture was initially denatured
at 94°C for 2 min, then amplified by 30-35 repeating
cycles (denaturation at 94oC for 45 s, annealing at 60
o
C for 45 s, extension at 72 oC for 1 min), followed by
a final extension at 72 oC for 5 min. The PCR products
were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel, and
the amplified cDNA bands were visualized by ethidium
bromide staining. The bands images were captured by
Chemi-Genius Bio Imaging System (Cambridge, UK).

Reagents
Alpha-MEM, EGF, bFGF, propidium iodide (PI),
and RNAase A were purchased from Invitrogen (Hong
Kong, China). HOE140, 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine
(BrdU), and mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody
were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO USA). Rabbit
polyclonal anti-Akt, anti-pAkt(Ser473), anti-ERK1/2
and anti-pERK1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling
(Danvers, MA, USA). Mouse monoclonal anti-BDKRB2
antibody was from Millipore (Merck Millipore, Germany).
B2R siRNA, mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin D1, mouse
monoclonal anti-cyclin E, HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit or rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody were products of
Santa-Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Transwell permeable support polycarbonate membrane
and other cell culture flasks and plates were purchased
from Corning Inc. (NY, USA).

Cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was determined using 3-(4,
5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) and 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU)
incorporation assay as described previously [40, 41].
For MTT assays, cells were plated into 96-well plates at
a density of ~3000 cells/well in 200 μL normal culture
medium for 12 h. Different concentrations of bradykinin
with or without HOE140 in α-MEM with 1% FBS were
added into each well. After incubation for 48 h, 10 µL PBS
buffered MTT (5 mg/mL) stock solution was applied to
each well. Then the plates were incubated for additional
4 h. The medium was discarded, and 100 µL dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) was added to each well. After
the formazan crystals were dissolved, the optical density
(OD) values (wave-lengths: test 570 nm; reference, 630
nm) of the samples were read on a μQuant microplate
spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT).
The percentage of OD values relative to vehicle control
was used to indicate the changes in cell proliferation as
shown in Figure 1D, Figure 5A and Figure 9D. For siRNA
transfection, cells were transfected with corresponding
siRNA molecules using Lipofectamine 2000 for 48-60 h
before 10 nM bradykinin was applied for incubation.
For BrdU incorporation assay, approximately 5×l0
4
cells were seeded to a 6-well plate containing a cover
glass. After a 12 h culture, the cells were incubated in a
medium containing 1% FBS and different concentrations
of bradykinin, and then 30 µg/mL BrdU was added for
24 h. Afterward, the cells were washed for 3 times in
PBS and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min
at room temperature. Cells were washed for 3 times
with PBS buffer and incubated in 2 M HCl for 15 min.
After 3 additional washes with PBS buffer, 0.01% Triton
X-100 in PBS was used. After blocking with 2% BSA
for 1 h, cells were incubated with a primary monoclonal
anti-BrdU antibody (1:200) overnight at 4oC, and then

Cell culture
Human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells were
isolated from human atrial specimens obtained from
patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. The
tissue collection was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Hong Kong University with informed consent as
described previously [28-30, 39]. The human cardiac
c-Kit+ progenitor cells (passages 3-8) were cultured at
37oC in 5% CO2 in Alpha-modified Eagle’s medium
(α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100
U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 5 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (EGF), and 5 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF). When cells grew to 80% - 90% confluence,
cells were harvested and plated onto 24-well plates for
transwell assays, 96-well plates for MTT assays, and
6-well plates for wound healing assays, western blots,
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and flow cytometry.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
The total RNA was extracted with TRIzol isolation
system as described previously [39]. Reverse transcription
(RT) was performed with the RT system (Takara Biotech,
Dalian China) in a 20-μL reaction system. After the RT
procedure, the cDNA was used for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Primer sequences
of human genes were: GAPDH primers, forward
5’-AACAGCGACACCCACTCCTC-3’ and reverse
5’-GAGGGGAGATTCAGTGTGGT-3’,
BDKRB1
primers, forward 5’-TGCCAACATTTATCATCTCC-3’

washed and incubated with a secondary FITC-conjugated
antibody (1:800) under dark conditions for 60 min at
room temperature. Propidium iodide (PI) (5 μg/mL) with
RNAase was used for staining the cell nucleus for 15 min.
Finally, images of the cells were taken with a confocal
microscope (Leica TCS SP5II, Germany) and BrdU
positive cells were counted for statistical analysis.

upper surface of the membrane were scraped off by cotton
swabs. The migrated cells on the lower surface of the
membrane were counted in 5-8 representative fields under
a microscope.

Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis

Western blot was performed as previously described
[42]. Briefly, cells were lysed with a modified RIPA buffer
with various protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was
determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell lysates were
mixed with sample buffer and denatured by heating to
95oC for 5 min. Samples were resolved via SDS-PAGE
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris Buffer Saline
with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) then probed with primary
antibodies (1:1000-2000) at 4oC overnight with agitation.
After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated
with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse
secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilutions in TBST at room
temperature for 1 hr. Membranes were washed again with
TBST then processed onto x-ray films using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system. The relative band
intensities were measured by quantitative scanning
densitometer and image analysis software.

Western blot analysis

Cell cycle distribution of human cardiac c-Kit+
progenitor cells was determined using a ﬂow cytometer
(FC500, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Brieﬂy, the cells
were detached using 0.25% trypsin, washed with PBS,
and ﬁxed with ice-cold ethanol (70%) overnight at
4oC. Ethanol was removed by centrifugation, and cell
pellets were washed with PBS. Cells were incubated
in a propidium iodide/PBS staining buffer (20 μg/mL
propidium iodide, 10 μg/mL RNaseA, and 0.1% Triton
X-100) at 37oC for 30 min. Data were collected using Cell
Quest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and
the percentages of G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase cells were
calculated with MODFIT LT software (BD Biosciences).

Cell migration

RNA interference

The cell mobility was determined using a woundhealing assay and a transwell assay [29]. Briefly,
human cardiac c-Kit+ progenitor cells with or without
transfecting corresponding siRNA were cultured to a
confluent monolayer, and then scraped with a 200 μL
pipette tip to produce acellular area for wound-healing
observation. The cells were immediately washed with
PBS, and then incubated with a culture medium containing
1% FBS and different concentrations of bradykinin or
bradykinin plus HOE140 for 8 h. The defined areas of
the wound gap were photographed under a phase contrast
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The migrated cells
on the images were counted to assess cell mobility under
different treatments.
Transwell assay was performed using a modified
Boyden chamber with 8 μm pore polycarbonate
membranes to examine the potential effect of bradykinin
on cell migration. The chambers were pre-coated with 600
µL serum-free medium for at least 1 h. After removing
pre-coating medium, around 5000 cells with or without
siRNA transfection were plated into the upper chamber
with 200 µL medium containing 1% FBS, and 600 µL
medium with 1% FBS and different concentrations of
bradykinin was maintained in the lower chamber. The
plates were incubated at 37oC in 5% CO2 for 8 h. Then the
chambers were washed three times with PBS, fixed with
formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and stained
with crystal violet for 15 min. After washing thoroughly
with PBS to remove the dye, non-migrated cells on the

Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules targeting
human B2R mRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. This siRNA is target-specific 19- to 25nt siRNA designed to knock down mRNA expression as
previously described [29, 39]. Human cardiac c-Kit+ cells
at 60 - 80% confluence in 96-well plates or 6-well plates
were transfected with siRNA molecules at 10-40 nM using
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The silencer
negative control siRNA, which has no known target in
human genomes, was applied as negative control. 48 to
72 h after transfection, cells were treated with/without 10
nM bradykinin then used for determining B2R mRNA and
protein expression, cell proliferation, cell cycle assay, as
well as migration assays or western blot for determining
signaling pathway.

Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean ± S.E.M. Unpaired
Student’s t-tests were used as appropriate to evaluate the
statistical significance of differences between two group
means, and one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-test
was used for multiple comparisons. Values of P < 0.05
were considered statistically significance.
