Inhibitors in Lung Cancer Cells

Abstract
Cancer cells with active drug efflux capability are multidrug resistant and pose a significant obstacle for
the efficacy of chemotherapy. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that high drug efflux cancer cells (HDECC)
may be selectively enriched with stem-like cancer cells, which are believed to be the cause for tumor initiation and recurrence. There is a great need for therapeutic reagents that are capable of eliminating HDECCs.
We developed an image-based high-content screening (HCS) system to specifically identify and analyze the
HDECC population in lung cancer cells. Using the system, we screened 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds that identified 12 potent HDECC inhibitors. It is shown that these inhibitors are able to overcome
multidrug resistance (MDR) and sensitize HDECCs to chemotherapeutic drugs, or directly reduce the tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells possibly by affecting stem-like cancer cells. The HCS system we established
provides a new approach for identifying therapeutic reagents overcoming MDR. The compounds identified
by the screening may potentially be used as potential adjuvant to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
drugs. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7723–33. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Multidrug-resistant cancer cells often survive chemotherapy and lead to tumor relapse. One of the most common
mechanisms underlying multidrug resistance (MDR) is drug
efflux, mediated by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters overexpressed on the cell membrane, which act as
efflux pumps to transport the drugs outwards (1, 2). Overcoming MDR by inhibiting the ABC transporters has been
unsuccessful, with three generations of inhibitors developed
and subjected to clinical trials but few significant advances
made (3–5). Intolerable side effects were frequently observed
as a result of the multiple pharmacologic activities of the
inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic interactions were often induced
that limited the clearance and metabolism of the coadministered chemotherapeutic drugs (5). These results suggest that
direct inhibition of ABC transporters may not be the ideal
strategy to combat MDR and alternative approaches are
needed to eliminate the drug efflux cancer cells.
A large degree of heterogeneity has been observed in the
drug efflux capability for cancer cells within the same tumor.

Eliminating the cells with high drug efflux capability is particularly important, as they are more likely to survive chemotherapy and lead to tumor relapse. More interestingly,
substantial evidences from many independent labs suggest
that the high drug efflux cancer cell (HDECC) population
may be highly enriched for stem-like cancer cells (6–14),
which are believed to be the cause of tumor initiation, propagation, and recurrence (15–17). Therefore, therapeutic treatment eliminating HDECCs may help to remove stem-like
cancer cells and prevent tumor relapse. This further highlights the importance of the development of therapeutic reagent specifically targeting HDECCs.
Drug discovery on HDECCs has been impeded by the lack
of appropriate high-throughput techniques. HDECCs have
been identified and isolated by flow cytometry, mostly using
the side population (SP) technique (18). However, the application of the flow cytometry approach in high-throughput
studies is restrictive, as it requires cumbersome single-cell
dissociation and the throughput of the instrument itself is
rather low. To date, there is no report of high-throughput
studies using the SP technique. On the other hand, recently,
automated image analysis aided by high-performance computing has enabled rapid advances in the development of
high-throughput image-based assays (19–22). Considering
that the fluorescence variance indicating HDECCs in SP
technique can be readily detected by fluorescence microscopy,
we sought to develop a new assay to identify and analyze
HDECCs based on fluorescence images. Compared with flow
cytometry, the image-based assay can be carried out directly
on attached live cells so that high throughput is easily
achievable with a regular automated fluorescence microscope. Direct visualization of the cellular phenotype also permits more comprehensive measurements of the responses to

perturbations, and the measurements can be performed specifically on single cells of interest (22). Moreover, considering
the wide availability of fluorescence microscopes, development of such image-based assay will greatly accelerate related research by allowing faster and cheaper collection of
high-throughput data, which may lead to novel treatment
against MDR or even cancer stem cells.
In this study, we first established a high-content screening
(HCS; ref. 23) system based on an image-based assay, which
can identify and analyze HDECCs. Using the system, we
screened 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds for their
effect on the prevalence of HDECCs in lung cancer cells. The
screening successfully identified compounds capable of turning HDECCs into non-HDECCs by removing their drug efflux
capability, and we named them HDECC inhibitors. It is
shown that these inhibitors can significantly enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs or reduce the tumorigenicity of cancer cells. These results support a correlation of the
HDECC population with stem-like cancer cells and suggest
that better therapeutic effect may be achieved by removing
the population. The compounds identified not only have the
potential to be used as drugs to improve chemotherapy efficacy but also provide insight into the possible mechanism
underlying the biology of HDECCs.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and compounds
All the cell lines were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C
in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, and they were used
within 10 passages for <6 months after receipt. Cell lines
were characterized by ATCC by morphology check, growth
curve analysis, and short tandem repeat DNA profiling. After
receipt, cells were confirmed to be free from Mycoplasma
contamination using the Mycoplasma Detection kit (Roche
Applied Science). Library of pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Image-based assay
Cancer cells were first incubated with 5 μg/mL Hoechst
33342 for 90 minutes at 37°C to stain the cell nuclei. Fluorescence images were taken using a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter to measure the intensity of each nucleus. After
that, verapamil was added to the medium to a final concentration of 50 μmol/L to block the efflux pump, and the fluorescence intensities of the nuclei were monitored for 30
minutes by time-lapse imaging. The experiments were carried out on an Olympus FV1000 microscope. Images were
taken using an Olympus UPlanFL 4×/0.13 PhP objective
and analyzed with a customized DCellIQ software with details described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Flow cytometry
Cells were treated with indicated compound for 48 hours
and subjected to SP analysis using the methods described
by Goodell and colleagues (18) with modifications. Briefly,

7724

cells were dissociated with trypsin-EDTA to single cells and
resuspended at 1×106/mL in prewarmed DMEM with 2% FBS
and 10 mmol/L HEPES. They were stained with 5 μg/mL
Hoechst 33342 for 90 minutes at 37°C, then washed with icecold HBSS with 2% FBS and 10 mmol/L HEPES once, and resuspended in the same buffer with 2 μg/mL propidium iodide
to gate viable cells. The cells were filtered through a 40-μm cell
strainer to obtain single-cell suspension before they were
sorted by flow cytometry. Analysis and sorting were done on
a MoFlo cell sorter (Dako). The Hoechst 33342 dye was excited
at 357 nm, and its fluorescence was analyzed under dual wavelength of 402 to 446 nm (blue) and 650 to 670 nm (red).
Cytotoxicity assay
SP cells isolated by flow cytometry were counted and seeded in 96-well plate at 2 × 104 per well. Cells were allowed to
recover for 24 hours before the assay. To test the cytotoxicity
of the compound alone, cells were treated with 5 μmol/L of
the indicated compound. For in vitro chemotherapy efficiency
test, cells were treated with four different chemotherapeutic
drugs at the following concentrations: cisplatin, 100 μmol/L;
etoposide, 100 μmol/L; doxorubicin, 20 μmol/L; paclitaxel,
400 nmol/L, with indicated compound at 5 μmol/L or vehicle
(0.05% DMSO). Cell viability was measured 48 hours later
using colorimetric MTS cell proliferation assay (CellTiter 96
Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega).
Absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate
reader (FluoStar Optima). Background was corrected using
an empty well as a control. Cytotoxicity was calculated as
follows:

Tumor xenograft
Animals were purchased from Charles River, and experiments were carried out in accordance with the institutional
guidelines for the use of laboratory animals. For the tumorigenesis study, tumors were formed by s.c. injecting cancer
cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. NCI H460 cells were treated with the indicated
compound at 5 μmol/L or vehicle (0.05% DMSO) for 48
hours. They were dissociated to single cells by trypsin-EDTA
and resuspended in PBS for injection. Groups of mice were
inoculated with 5 × 105, 5 × 104, or 5 × 103 cells in 100 μL
volume. Tumor growth was monitored every 2 days. Animals
were sacrificed after 4 months or until the tumor grow to
>2.0 cm in diameter.
For the chemo-combination treatment study, tumors
were formed by s.c. injecting 1 × 105 NCI H460 cells into
the flank of nu/nu mouse. Treatment was started when
the tumors developed to ∼5 mm in diameter. Compound
was injected i.p. for three times every 2 days. From the day
of second compound administration, cisplatin (3 mg/kg) was
injected i.p. for three times every 2 days. The day of first
cisplatin administration was designated day 0, and tumor
sizes were measured every 2 days thereafter. Tumor volume
was calculated by the formula 0.52 × length × width2. Most

In vitro colony formation assay
Purified SP cells were treated with indicated compound.
They were then plated at clonal density (1,250 per well) in
the flat-bottomed 24-well plate. Culture medium contained
0.35% agarose to immobilize the cells. The numbers of clones
formed were counted after 2 weeks.
Statistical data analysis and EC50 curve fitting
Data were presented as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by two-tailed t test and power analysis
using Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft). P values of

Results
HDECCs can be identified by fluorescence microscopy
Similar to SP assay, we used Hoechst dye as an indicator
to measure the drug efflux from cancer cells. The assay was
first tested on NCI H460 lung cancer cells, which have been
shown to contain SP cells that are enriched with stem-like
cancer cells (11). After incubating the cells with 5 μg/mL
Hoechst 33342 for 90 minutes, a few dye-resistant cells were
detected as indicated by the significantly lower intensity of

the nuclei (Fig. 1A, 0 min). To verify that the low fluorescence is caused by drug efflux and exclude all other possibilities, 50 μmol/L verapamil was added to the medium to
block the efflux pump in the presence of Hoechst dye. The
treatment significantly increased the intensities of the dyeresistant cells to almost normal level within 30 minutes
(Fig. 1A). In this approach, HDECCs were identified with
high confidence by microscopy. Using the assay, HDECCs
were detected in 11 cell lines we tested, including 8 lung cancer cell lines, 2 breast cancer cell lines, and 1 prostate cancer
cell line (Table 1).

Drug Screening on HDECCs

To accurately measure the percentage of HDECCs, fluorescence images were taken under a low-magnification 4× objective so that a large number of cells (∼4,000) could be
analyzed. For NCI H460 cells, statistical analysis showed that
the result had normal distribution with an average of 1.3%
and a half-width of <0.5 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). To test

whether the accuracy is capable to identify HDECC effectors, SP-free cells were prepared by removing the SP cells
using flow cytometry to mimic the effect of HDECC inhibitors. This significantly reduced the HDECC percentage to
0.05%, and our assay predictably detected it (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). This confirmed that the HDECCs we identified

were equivalent to SP and the image-based assay had the
capability to identify inhibitors on them.
Automated image analysis enables the image-based
assay for HCS study
Regular automated fluorescence microscopes typically can
acquire >10,000 images per day; the factor that limits the
throughput of the image-based assay is now often the ability
to process the massive image data generated (32, 33). To
overcome the limit, we developed image analysis program
to automatically identify HDECCs. The image stack was first
aligned to correct the displacements of frames due to the
drift of microscope. Cells were then detected and segmented
in each image using algorithms implemented in DCellIQ software (32, 33). Then, the cells were registered to quantify the
fluorescence variation (see Supplementary Materials and
Methods for details). Through the automated quantification,
HDECCs were distinguished from non-HDECCs as shown in
Fig. 1B. Due to the marked discrepancy observed between the
two populations, we simplified image analysis to use only
two images to identify HDECCs so that the assay was greatly
accelerated (Fig. 1C). Dull cells (initial fluorescence intensity
<2/3 average) significantly brightened by verapamil treatment (ΔF >50% after 10 minutes) were designated as
HDECCs. The parameters were arbitrarily set and optimized,
as there is no quantitative definition of HDECCs or SP. Our
results presented later showed that with the parameters, the
image-based assay result is consistent with SP analysis. With
the program, HDECCs were automatically identified and
counted after image acquisition (Fig. 1D), so that >1,000 conditions (twelve 96-well plates) can be screened daily with a
regular fluorescence microscope. This made the system feasible to conduct HCS studies.
LOPAC screening identifies HDECC inhibitors
Screening was carried out on LOPAC library, which contains 1,280 latest compounds representing all major target
classes (34, 35), to identify inhibitors that can markedly reduce the number of HDECCs in NCI H460 cells. Cells were

7728

Cancer Res; 70(19) October 1, 2010

treated with 5 μmol/L of the compound for 48 hours. To
exclude ABC transporter inhibitors and identify effectors
inhibiting HDECCs through other mechanisms, cells were
then extensively washed to remove the binding compound
before the assay (Fig. 2A). Consequently, none of the known
inhibitors (e.g., verapamil and cyclosporin A) was identified
as screening hit, although they can markedly reduce
HDECCs if the cells were not washed (data not shown).
The screening was carried out in 96-well plate format with
a minimum of three replicates. Reproducibility was confirmed by Pearson correlation analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). The suitability of the system for high-throughput
screening was also confirmed by Z′-factor test (36). Due to
the lack of known HDECC inhibitor, positive controls were
prepared by either removing SP cells using flow cytometry
or treating cells with 5 μmol/L ABC transporter inhibitor
verapamil for 48 hours and then performing the assay without washing. Z′-factors were above 0.5 using both positive
controls as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2B.
Significant cytotoxicity was observed for 76 (5.9%) compounds in the screening. The cytotoxicity caused >50% reduction of total cell numbers in these wells over the time
course of the assay. Cells treated with these compounds also
appeared to be granule and detached from plate. The images,
before and after verapamil treatment, could not be aligned as
a result of the mobility of the detached cells. Therefore, these
compounds were excluded from further analysis. Twelve potent inhibitors were identified in the screening when the
threshold for selection of hits was set at 5 SD from the mean
(Fig. 2B, red circles). These compounds and their known
protein targets are listed in Table 2. To further exclude
the possibility that these inhibitors simply block pump
function, assays were carried out to measure HDECCs following a short-term compound treatment for 30 minutes.
None of the 12 inhibitors caused significant reduction (P >
0.05) of HDECCs in this condition (Supplementary Fig. S3),
confirming that the effects were achieved through long-term
cellular mechanism (possibly transcriptional) instead of
acutely blocking pumps. To verify the primary screening hits,

dose-response experiments were carried out and the EC50 values were calculated (Fig. 2C). The result showed that these
inhibitors can achieve the inhibitive effect at comparable or
lower concentrations than compounds selectively killing
P-glycoprotein–overexpressed MDR cells such as NSC73306

(37, 38). None of the inhibitors had significant effect on the
cell viability or proliferation until 10 μmol/L (Fig. 2C), excluding the possibility that the reduction of HDECC percentage
was caused by the increase of non-HDECCs. The time-lapse
imaging capability of the image-based assay also allowed us

to test whether the inhibitors can directly kill HDECCs. The
result showed that HDECCs survived the treatment of all the
12 inhibitors based on bright-field inspection. However, their
drug efflux capability was significantly impaired by the treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). Overall, the screening identified 12 nontoxic compounds that can potently inhibit the
drug efflux capability of HDECCs through mechanism other
than blocking ABC transporters.
When the threshold for selection of hits was lowered to 3
SD from the mean, additional 12 compounds were identified
as screening hits. Many of the effective compounds share the
same protein targets (e.g., three inhibitors are dopamine receptor antagonists). It is surprising that the effects of the
compounds on lung cancer cells are achieved through
neurotransmitter receptors. However, our Western blot result showed that indeed D1 and D2 dopamine receptors were
expressed in the lung cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The exact molecular mechanism underlying the compound effects still remains to be studied. Interestingly, the screening
also identified five compounds that can markedly increase
the HDECC percentage by >5-fold, such as retinoic acid and
its analogue TTNPB (Fig. 2B, blue squares). A complete list
of the screening results is shown in Supplementary Table S1.

SP analysis was carried out to further validate the assay
and confirm screening hits. NCI H460 cells were treated with
5 μmol/L of the compound for 48 hours and sorted by flow
cytometry. A representative dot plot from triplet experiment
for each inhibitor is shown in Supplementary Fig. S6. The average percentage of SP cells was normalized (control set as 1)
and plotted in Fig. 2D. Significant inhibition of SP was
achieved for all the inhibitors except Kenpaullone, for which
large variation among experiments was observed. This strongly supported that the HDECCs identified by the image-based

assay were identical to SP and the system we established can
be used reliably to identify inhibitors on them.
HDECC inhibitors increase the efficacy of
chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo
HDECCs are significant obstacles for chemotherapy as
they cause MDR. We next tested whether the inhibitors
may help to overcome this obstacle by sensitizing HDECCs
to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our result first showed that indeed HDECCs were significantly more resistant to four commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, etoposide,
doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) compared with the unsorted
whole cancer cell population (Supplementary Fig. S7; ref.
11). Nine of the 12 inhibitors successfully reversed the drug
resistance and enabled much more HDECCs to be killed
in vitro (Fig. 3A) by the coadministered chemotherapeutic
drugs. When these compounds were administered alone,
no significant cytotoxicity was observed on the HDECCs
purified as SP cells (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with the
time-lapse cell tracking results (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The sensitization effect was universal for the four structurally
dissimilar and functionally divergent drugs, confirming the
capability of the inhibitors to remove MDR. This result suggests that the reported system may provide a new tool for
drug discovery to treat MDR, which has been a major goal
for cancer biologists for decades (5).
The nine compounds that can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in vitro were further tested in vivo using a xenografted animal model. Compounds were administered in
combination with cisplatin at dosages indicated in Materials
and Methods. Animals that received fiduxosin hydrochloride
became moribund so that the experiment was terminated according to institutional animal use guideline. No significant effects were observed for six compounds (Supplementary Fig. S8)
compared with animals receiving cisplatin treatment alone. The

Drug Screening on HDECCs

remaining two compounds (PRL-3 inhibitor I and fluspirilene)
significantly enhanced the chemotherapy efficacy, which further inhibited tumor growth compared with cisplatin alone
(P < 0.05 after day 8 for PRL-3 inhibitor I and after day 10
for fluspirilene; Fig. 3C).
HDECC inhibitors reduce the tumorigenicity of lung
cancer cells
In light of the evidences that HDECCs may be highly enriched with stem-like cancer cells, we sought to test whether
the HDECC inhibitors can also inhibit stem-like cancer cells.
Animal transplant experiments were carried out to assess the
in vivo tumor formation ability of NCI H460 cells after compound treatment in vitro for 48 hours. For control cells treated with DMSO, all the injections result in tumor formation
when >5 × 104 cells were injected, and most (five of six) injections formed tumor at 5 × 103 cells per dosage. When the
cells were treated with the inhibitors, no significant effects
were observed for eight compounds (Table 3). Interestingly,
four of the compounds (fluphenazine dihydrochloride, fluspirilene, PRL-3 inhibitor I, and DMCM) decreased the tumor
formation incidence when 5 × 103 cells were injected. None of
the reduction was complete because the treated cells still
formed tumors in some injections. However, compared with
the groups of compounds that did not show effect, the reductions caused by these four inhibitors were statistically significant (Table 3). These compounds were also shown to be
able to reduce the colony formation capability of purified
SP cells in vitro by the agarose colony formation assay (Supplementary Fig. S9). These results suggest that the four compounds may directly interfere with the function of stem-like
cancer cells. The results also support that there is direct correlation between the HDECC population and the stem-like
cancer cell population, which has been controversial, although it is supported by more and more emerging evidence.
Fluphenazine dihydrochloride and DMCM were not effective
in the above-mentioned in vivo chemo-combination treatment study. This is possibly caused by limited compound
accessibility to tumor cells in vivo or poor pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics of the compounds, which remain to
be studied.

Discussion
In this study, we developed an image-based assay to specifically analyze the HDECC population in cancer cells. The
assay can be easily adopted for high-throughput studies
using a regular automated fluorescence microscope. This capability was shown by a screening on the LOPAC library,
which successfully identified 12 compounds that can potently inhibit HDECCs in lung cancer cells. Our study focused on
lung cancer cells, but the assay can also be performed on
adherent cancer cells of other origins (Table 1).
The nature of HDECCs is still unclear. Many recent studies
showed that they are more tumorigenic when injected into
immunodeficient mice, suggesting that they are selectively
enriched with stem-like cancer cells (6–14). Whether there
is correlation between the two cell populations remains con-

www.aacrjournals.org

troversial, and our results that four compounds inhibiting
HDECCs reduced the tumorigenicity of cancer cells provided
new evidence for this correlation. Moreover, several proteins
targeted by the inhibitors identified in this work have been
shown by independent studies to play key roles in stem-like
cancer cells. One of the targets, PRL-3, has been associated
with tumorigenesis and metastasis by many studies (39, 40).
Compounds modulating the other target, dopamine receptor,
can potently inhibit the growth of cancerous neural progenitor cells (35). These evidences support an effect of the HDECC
inhibitors on stem-like cancer cells and a relationship between HDECCs and stem-like cancer cells. However, it should
be noted that none of the inhibition of tumorigenicity was
complete, possibly because the two cell populations are not
identical, although highly overlapping. Drug screening on
cancer stem cells is challenging due to the rarity of these cells
as well as their instability in culture such that few advances
have been made thus far (41), and the current reported system may provide a new angle for cancer stem cell research
and drug discovery.
In addition to their correlation with stem-like cancer cells,
HDECCs represent a major obstacle for chemotherapy as
they cause MDR. Traditionally, development of drugs to overcome resistance has been done on induced resistant cell lines
generated by continuous or pulsed exposure to drugs (42, 43).
However, such induced cells often are associated with
changes that are partly characteristic of resistance to certain
drugs instead of MDR (44). We adopted a different approach
by selectively studying an intrinsic MDR cell population in
the context of the whole cancer cell population. Nine compounds were identified by the reported HCS system that
can nonspecifically enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
drugs in vitro, and two of them were further shown to be also
effective in vivo (Fig. 3), highlighting its potential for MDR
drug discovery. However, MDR can be caused by a huge variety of transporters and many of them may not be revealed
by the Hoechst efflux assay, as well as mechanisms other
than drug efflux (5), so that ineffective compounds may be
identified in our screening. Indeed, three inhibitors failed
to improve chemotherapy efficacy either in vitro or in vivo,
although they were able to reduce Hoechst efflux. Nevertheless, most inhibitors identified significantly improved the
efficacy for all the chemotherapy drugs we tested at least
in vitro, suggesting that Hoechst efflux may be used as an effective indicator for MDR. None of the effective inhibitors kill
HDECCs directly, and our system was able to identify these
nontoxic effectors because the image-based approach allowed more comprehensive measurement of the responses
to perturbance than simple viability assay. Our study focused
on drug efflux and cell viability, but actually a complete morphology phenotype profile can be generated from the images
(22), which may greatly facilitate related mechanism study in
the future.
High-throughput compound library screening usually
identifies effectors that result in desired phenotype without
revealing their mechanism. In the absence of the knowledge,
it is hard to predict the therapeutic potential of the compounds as they may be associated with severe side effects.

For this concern, we used LOPAC library, of which the
compound has been extensively characterized with known
protein-substrate interactions. Such approach may not only
allow quick translation of the screening result to clinical
application but also reveal the “chemical genetics” (45) to
provide insight into the related molecular mechanisms. The
latter potential is shown by the consistency of our screening
results with previous reports on individual protein targets,
like the aforementioned roles of dopamine receptor and
PRL-3 for stem-like cancer cells. Reduction of HDECC by
the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) inhibitor
PQ401 is also consistent with previous reports that IGF-IR
inhibition may sensitize lung cancer cells to chemotherapy
(46), suggesting a key role of IGF-IR for MDR. The finding
that retinoic acid can significantly increase HDECC is surprising, but retinoic acid has long been noticed to be able
to induce the expression of MDR genes and cause drug resistance (47, 48), although it has been used clinically for leukemia treatment to induce stem cell differentiation. Other

mechanisms, such as the reduction of tumorigenicity
by DMCM, are unclear and need to be further investigated.
With a more complete library with most major signaling
pathways targeted by multiple structurally divergent chemicals, such chemical genetics approach would help to reveal
the whole repertoire of signaling pathways underlying
HDECCs.
