BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare and lethal disease with few therapeutic options. Preclinical data suggest that the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway could be involved in its progression. METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial recruited
chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced BTC displaying a wild-type (WT) KRAS status. Patients were randomized to gemcitabine
(1000 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) with (arm A) or without (arm B) panitumumab (6 mg/kg) for up to 12 cycles. The primary endpoint
was progression-free survival (PFS) analyzed in an intention-to-treat fashion. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients (45 in arm A and 44 in arm
B) were enrolled between June 2010 and September 2013. After a median follow-up of 10.1 months, the median PFS was 5.3 months
(95% confidence interval, 3.3-7.2 months) in arm A and 4.4 months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.2 months) in arm B (P 5.27). No
survival differences were observed: the median overall survival was 9.9 months in arm A and 10.2 months in arm B (P 5.42). In a subgroup analysis, no differences in PFS according to the site of the primary tumor were observed; patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with panitumumab may have had a survival benefit in comparison with the control group (15.1 vs 11.8 months,
P 5.13). As for safety, skin toxicity was the main adverse event in arm A (80% of the patients). A higher incidence of diarrhea (55.5%
vs 31.8%), mucositis (22.2% vs 13.6%), and constipation (24.4% vs 15.9%) was seen in arm A. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the

INTRODUCTION
Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors that include intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHC), and gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GBC). BTCs are rare in Western countries but
extremely lethal1; only a small percentage of patients are diagnosed with early-stage, resectable disease, and patients who
undergo an operation have a high risk of recurrence, with 5-year survival rates in the range of 20% to 40%.2
As for the metastatic or unresectable stage, palliative chemotherapy is, to date, the mainstay of treatment. Cisplatin
plus gemcitabine is considered the first-line standard of care according to Valle et alâ€™s ABC-02 trial.3 Compared with gemcitabine alone, the combination therapy yielded an advantage both in progression-free survival (PFS; 8.0 vs 5.0 months,
P < .001) and in overall survival (OS; 11.7 vs 8.1 months, P < .001).
Oxaliplatin is widely used in clinical practice instead of cisplatin: the safety profile of the gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
(GEMOX) regimen and the good response rates strongly suggest that it is reasonable to replace the standard schedule with
GEMOX.4,5

GEMOX and Panitumumab in WT KRAS BTC/Leone et al

Preclinical data have suggested the involvement of
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway in
BTC pathogenesis. EGFR is often overexpressed in this
disease, and in some cases, activating mutations have been
detected.6,7 Initial phase 2 studies using anti-EGFRâ€“
targeted agents have shown promising results8 and have
paved the way to randomized trials.
Panitumumab (Vectibix; Amgen) is a fully human
immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody against EGFR
and was initially approved for metastatic colorectal cancer
with wild-type (WT) KRAS on exon 2.
On the basis of this knowledge, we designed this
randomized phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy of
GEMOX chemotherapy plus panitumumab as a first-line
treatment for patients with WT KRAS advanced BTC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We designed a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1)
phase 2 study with the aim of evaluating the clinical activity of the combination of panitumumab with GEMOX
chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for unresectable
and metastatic BTC.
We recruited patients across 12 Italian university
hospitals and cancer institutes. The protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at each participating institution, and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The main inclusion criteria of the protocol were as
follows:
 Histologically or cytologically documented unresectable or metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma either at
diagnosis or as a relapse after surgery.
 WT KRAS status (defined as no mutations in exon 2,
codons 12-13) determined for the primary or metastatic
tumor. Analyses were performed at each participating
institution on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue with
validated assays such as polymerase chain reaction and
Sanger sequencing. Tumor samples were then collected
and centralized at our center to widen the assessment of
other key gene expression or mutations, which could
act as possible predictive markers of response or resistance. RAS, BRAF, and PI3KCA testing was performed
with a mass spectrometry technique (matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight method;
Sequenom).
 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2.
 Adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function.

Patients with previous exposure to systemic treatment, either chemotherapy or targeted agents, were
excluded, as were patients who had serious comorbidities
or were unable to fulfill the protocol requirements. All
patients provided written, informed consent.
Once enrolled, eligible subjects were randomized
through a computed system with permuted-block randomization and stratified according to the ECOG PS (0-1 vs 2)
and the site of the primary tumor (IHC vs EHC and GBC).
Because this was an open-label study, participants, investigators, and trial staff were made aware of treatment allocations.
Patients in both arms received gemcitabine at
1000 mg/m2 on day 1 and oxaliplatin at 100 mg/m2 on
day 2 of each 2-week cycle.
Patients who were assigned to arm A also received
panitumumab at 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each 2-week cycle.
Each patient was treated for a maximum of 12 cycles
or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
patientâ€™s refusal. Patients in the experimental arm without
tumor progression at the end of chemotherapy (12 completed GEMOX cycles or interruption for unacceptable
toxicity from chemotherapy) had the option of continuing panitumumab at 6 mg/kg once every 2 weeks until tumor progression or toxicity.
Subjects were evaluated for tumor progression every
8 6 1 weeks. The tumor response assessment was performed by the investigator with version 1.1 of the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
The study was designed to have PFS as the primary
endpoint; this was defined as the time from randomization
to evidence of progression (RECIST 1.1), death, or the last
radiographic assessment in the absence of a PFS event. The
secondary endpoints were the objective response rate
(ORR; RECIST 1.1), OS, and safety (National Cancer
Instituteâ€™s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 3.0, with the exception of skin toxicity).
We assumed a median PFS time for the control arm
(GEMOX) of 6 months9 and a median PFS for the experimental arm panitumumab gemcitabine oxaliplatin (PGEMOX) of 10 months. This would correspond to a hazard ratio of 0.60. For a specified a value of .10 and a
power (1 â€“ b) of 80%, 74 accumulated events were
required for the log-rank test.
Accounting for a 10% loss to follow-up in both
arms and a follow-up time of 12 months, we found that a
total sample of 88 patients was required to yield the necessary number of events in case of a constant accrual rate.
The log-rank analysis was stratified by the ECOG PS (0-1
vs 2) and the site of the primary tumor (IHC vs EHC and
GBC).

The time to endpoint events was estimated with
Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the log-rank test (pooled over
strata) was used to compare data between treatment
groups with an intention-to-treat approach. Safety results
were compared with the Yates chi-square test. Data were
analyzed with IBM-SPSS Statistics 20.
RESULTS
A total of 89 patients were enrolled in the study between
June 2010 and September 2013, with 45 patients randomly assigned to arm A and 44 patients assigned to arm
B. All subjects received at least 1 cycle of treatment, with a
median number of 7 cycles administered in each arm.
Overall, 27 patients completed the treatment plan of 12
cycles: 12 in the P-GEMOX group and 15 in the
GEMOX group. Nine patients in arm A then received
maintenance with panitumumab until toxicity or disease
progression (range, 1-28 cycles). The reasons for discontinuing treatment in the remaining subjects included radiological progressive disease (30 patients), clinical
progressive disease (8 patients), adverse events (8
576

patients), death (5 patients), medical decision (5 patients),
consent withdrawal (5 patients), and lack of compliance
(1 patient). A total of 84 patients were evaluable for their
response according to RECIST 1.1. Radiological restaging was missing for 5 patients (1 in arm A and 4 in arm B)
because of clinical progressive disease (3 patients), an
adverse event (1 patient), or death (1 patient) before the
first assessment (Fig. 1).
In the overall population, the median age at the time
of randomization was 64.1 years (range, 36.8-78.5 years),
and the percentage of females was higher (64%). Almost
half of the patients (47.1%) were diagnosed with IHC,
whereas 31.4% were diagnosed with GBC, and 21.3%
were diagnosed with EHC. Patients were mostly metastatic (84.2%) and had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (98.8%).
The baseline levels of tumor marker carbohydrate antigen
19-9 and alkaline phosphatase were 79 IU/L (range, 060,000 IU/L) and 187 IU/L (range, 52-1254 IU/L),
respectively. The baseline characteristics were globally
well balanced between the study groups and are shown in
Table 1.

After a median follow-up of 10.1 months, at the
time of the final analysis, 86 PFS events were observed.
The median PFS was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-7.2 months) in arm A and 4.4 months (95%
CI, 2.6-6.2 months) in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95%
CI, 0.51-1.21; log-rank test P 5 .27; Fig. 2A). No differences in OS were observed, with a median OS of 9.9
months (95% CI, 5.4-14.3 months) in arm A and 10.2
months (95% CI, 6.4-13.9 months) in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.53-1.3; P 5 .42; Fig. 2B).
Among the evaluable patients, the response rate was
26.6% in arm A and 18.1% in arm B, and the diseasecontrol rate was 75.5% and 68.1%, respectively (chisquare P 5 .99). One patient from each group achieved a
complete response. Responses in each arm are shown in
Table 2.
We performed subgroup analyses as specified in the
protocol; this entailed analyzing the survival variables
according to the site of the primary tumor (IHC vs EHC
and GBC), which was also a stratification factor. The median number of cycles was 8 in the IHC group and 6 in
the EHC-GBC group.
In the intention-to-treat population, the median
PFS for the 42 IHC patients was 5.7 months (95% CI,
2.7-8.7 months) in arm A and 6.2 months (95% CI, 3.19.2 months) in arm B (Fig. 2C). The median PFS for the
EHC and GBC patients was 4.9 months (95% CI, 2.47.4 months) in arm A and 3.8 months (95% CI, 2.3-5.3
months) in arm B (Fig. 2D).

However, IHC patients exposed to panitumumab
had an improvement in OS of 3.3 months in comparison
with the control group, but this was not statistically significant (15.1 vs 11.8 months; P 5 .13; Fig. 2E). We
explored any potential explanation for this survival
advantage in IHC patients despite similar PFS. In this
subgroup, the median number of cycles was 6 (range,
3-12) in the P-GEMOX group and 11 (range, 2-12) in
the GEMOX group, with more patients in the standard
arm completing the preplanned 12-cycle treatment (10
patients in the GEMOX group vs 6 patients in the
P-GEMOX group). Moreover, we could not demonstrate
any significant difference in the causes of the end of treatment, occurrence of adverse events, second-line treatments, or surgery between the arms (data not shown).
We also conducted a post hoc analysis for patients
who were WT for KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PI3KCA.
Only 56 of 89 samples could be analyzed, and among
these, we found 3 patients with BRAF V600E mutations,
2 with NRAS mutations (A146S and Q61R), and 2 with
PI3KCA E545K mutations. Patients with mutations were
equally distributed between the study arms. No difference
in PFS or OS was seen in quadruple WT patients treated
with panitumumab. Survival results are summarized in
Table 3.
We collected all adverse events and serious adverse
events from randomization to the end-of-treatment visit.
Treatment was generally well tolerated in both arms, and
the safety profile of panitumumab was consistent with
that observed for other panitumumab-based combinations. As anticipated, skin toxicity was the main adverse
event in the P-GEMOX arm and affected up to 80% of
the patients: conjunctivitis (11.1%) and ungueal toxicity
(20%) were also increased. Neurotoxicity and constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms were equally common in both groups, although a higher incidence of
diarrhea (55.5% vs 31.8%, chi-square P 5 .04), mucositis
(22.2 vs 13.7%, P 5 .61), constipation (24.4% vs 15.9%,
P 5 .46), hypomagnesemia (15.5% vs 2.2%, P 5 .06),
and hypokalemia (22.2% vs 4.5%, P 5 .03) was seen in
patients treated with panitumumab. Previous experience
with panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy
in a neoadjuvant setting, for which pathological data were
also available, did not lead us to anticipate considerable
hepatic toxicity10; nevertheless, we noticed a higher incidence of transaminase increases (P 5 .16) and cholestasis
(P 5 .67) in arm A (nonsignificant), which might be a
specific feature of tumors prone to cholestasis such as
BTC. Patients with EHC-GBC had an incidence of transaminitis, cholestasis, and cholangitis similar to that of

DISCUSSION
Our results show that the addition of panitumumab to
GEMOX chemotherapy for WT KRAS biliary cancer,
though generally well tolerated, results in a marginal, nonsignificant improvement in PFS.
These results are consistent with recent randomized
studies and provide additional evidence of the marginal
role of anti-EGFR therapy in BTC.
At the time of the trialâ€™s design, a strong preclinical
rationale suggested the effectiveness of an EGFR inhibitor
in BTC, and a few case reports and initial data from a
phase 2 study of GEMOX and cetuximab were also promising. More recently, the results of several studies conducted worldwide with either monoclonal antibodies or
kinase inhibitors have been published. Nonrandomized
phase 2 studies have shown an ORR of up to 63% or a
median OS of up to 20.3 months.8,11-15 However, in 2

randomized phase 2 studies of GEMOX with or without
cetuximab, anti-EGFR therapy only marginally improved
PFS and ORR, with no impact on OS in both European16
and Asian populations.17 Similarly disappointing results
were obtained with a different approach to EGFR inhibition. In a phase 3 trial, erlotinib, added to GEMOX in an
Asian population, was able to demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement only in ORR and a trend toward
better survival in the experimental arm.18 In this study,
cholangiocarcinoma patients obtained a statistically significant advantage in PFS from the treatment with erlotinib plus GEMOX (5.9 months) in comparison with those
treated with GEMOX alone (3 months).
In our population, all patients had WT KRAS on
exon 2 as a result of a key inclusion criterion. At the time
of the trialâ€™s design, because of the strong preclinical evidence of EGFR involvement in BTC, this was a reasonable hypothesis both for KRASâ€™s biological function within
the EGFR pathway and for its predictive role in colorectal
cancer patients treated with panitumumab or cetuximab.
This rationale is partially supported by published results.
In particular, Hezel et al15 observed the best results in
terms of OS and PFS (20.3 and 10.6 months, respectively) in WT KRAS patients along with a very high ORR
(45%). As for randomized trials, some retrospective data
are available from studies by Malka et al16 and Lee et al,18
but because of the low percentage of samples analyzed, the
predictive value of KRAS and BRAF mutations and EGFR
overexpression is inconclusive. In a trial by Chen et al,17
patients were stratified by the presence of the KRAS mutation, and an advantage for WT patients was observed
regardless of the treatment received; this envisages a prog580

nostic, rather than predictive, role. These studies are summarized in Table 5.
In a subgroup analysis, we reported a possible
improvement in OS only for patients with IHC treated
with panitumumab. The reason for this finding is difficult
to interpret because of the lack of statistical significance.
However, other studies have also shown a trend toward
better outcomes for IHC patients treated with antiEGFRâ€“targeted agents.17,18 Is there any underlying biology that could explain why patients with IHC may benefit
from EGFR inhibition? Our findings themselves do not
justify the design of a new randomized clinical trial in this
setting of patients; however, we think that data from available studies should be put together to draw more solid
conclusions.
It is likely that the complexity of activated pathways
in malignant cholangiocytes does not fit the paradigms of
efficacy that have been built up for other diseases. Could
there be a benefit of anti-EGFR treatment that was not
immediately evident, even with selecting the patients as
we did? In our population, a deeper analysis of downstream EGFR effectors has not produced meaningful
results. If we think about the differences in etiology, the
different behaviors according to tumor site, the molecular
subtypes of BTC, and the recent discovery of new driving
pathways, we get a picture of a rare and very heterogeneous disease. Therefore, it is difficult to identify a subset of
patients for whom anti-EGFRâ€“targeted agents could have
an impact on the natural history of the disease.
Because data have been obtained from many similar
studies, a pooled analysis of the results could help in identifying the patients who may benefit from anti-EGFR

therapy. Until then, the history of anti-EGFR therapy in
BTC does not deserve further investigations, and we have
to explore alternative strategies for future trials for such a
rare and varied disease.
