BACKGROUND. This retrospective, single-center study assessed the feasibility, outcome, and late side effects of the treatment of immunocompetent patients with
primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) at the authors’ institution.

METHODS. All 72 consecutive patients diagnosed with PCNSL between January
1994 and February 2005 were scheduled to receive high-dose methotrexate
(HDMTX)-based chemotherapy.

performance score (KPS) was 70. Twelve patients did not receive HDMTX-based
chemotherapy because of poor physical condition or renal insufficiency. Of the
followed with whole-brain irradiation. Of 54 patients who were evaluable for
response, 35 (65%) responded (52% with a complete response and 13% with a
partial response), and 19 patients (35%) did not. At a median follow-up of 58.7
months, the median progression-free survival was 9 months and the median
overall survival (OAS) was 41.4 months. According to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognosis score, patients could be divided into 3
groups with significantly different OAS: 52.9 months for patients aged <50 years,
42.4 months for patients aged 50 years and with a KPS >70, and 5.2 months for
patients aged 50 years and with a KPS <70 (P 5 .009, log-rank test).

CONCLUSIONS. Promising long-term results could be achieved with HDMTXbased chemotherapy in patients with PCNSL in this monocenter study. The
MSKCC score proved useful for predicting survival. Cancer 2008;112:1812–20.

rimary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and primary
intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) in immunocompetent patients are
rare variants of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma exclusively
involving the brain, leptomeninges, eyes, or spinal cord.
The prognosis is poor when the disease is treated with wholebrain irradiation (WBI) alone. Improved outcome has been reported
with the introduction of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX)-based
chemotherapy as first-line treatment, with or without WBI, in
numerous phase 2 trials.1 However, these optimistic results have
failed to translate into a comparable population-based survival benefit according to analyses of cancer registries.2,3 Moreover, markedly
inferior results have been found in retrospective British and German
single-center analyses4,5 and a multicenter German trial with 28 participating institutions.6 A positive patient selection with respect to
age, performance status, and other established prognostic factors as

well as the experience of single centers, specialized
in the treatment of PCNSL, may have been responsible for the favorable outcome reported in many published phase 2 studies.
Age and performance status are unanimously
accepted as powerful prognostic factors independent
of therapeutic choice in PCNSL,7–9 although additional predictors of response and survival such as
lactate dehydrogenase serum level, cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) protein level, and involvement of the
deep brain structures have been identified.10 Based
on our own findings in the setting of a large multicenter trial,6 survival in PCNSL is also correlated
with chemotherapy response and the treating institution’s experience. Recently, a prognostic score for
PCNSL patients was proposed by the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), based on
age and Karnofsky performance score (KPS).9 In the
current analysis, we provide long-term data regarding
our patient collective and attempt to validate the
MSKCC score.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All consecutive patients diagnosed with PCNSL or
PIOL between January 1994 and February 2005 at the
study institution were included in this retrospective
study. A diagnosis of cerebral or ocular lymphoma
had to be primarily confirmed histologically by
tumor biopsy and/or cytologically from the CSF or
aqueous in the case of leptomeningeal or ocular
involvement. In rare cases in which biopsy was not
feasible or inconclusive, a strong suspicion of PCNSL
based on radiomorphologic and clinical features after
the exclusion of other conditions was accepted if
treatment was initiated accordingly. All patients had
a staging evaluation before treatment that included
contrast-enhanced cerebral computed tomography
(CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans of the brain with gadolinium, CT of the chest/
abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, creatinine
clearance, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
testing. An eye examination was performed only in
patients with ocular symptoms.
We intended to treat all patients with HDMTXbased chemotherapy. Two regimens were used:
between January 1994 and April 2000, HDMTX (at a
dose of 1.5 g/m2 intravenously [iv] over 24 hours on
Day 2) combined with carmustine (at a dose of 80
mg/m2 iv on Day 1), and procarbazine (at a dose of
100 mg/m2 orally on Days 1–8), was repeated every 4
weeks (BMPD-Protocol),4 and between May 2000 and
February 2005 HDMTX monotherapy (at a dose of 4
g/m2 iv over 4 hours on Day 1), was repeated every 2

1813

weeks for a maximum of 6 courses. In 1 patient,
HDMTX was combined with ifosfamide (at a dose of
2 g/m2 iv over 3 hours on Days 3–5) for the last
3 courses, and 1 patient received 2 consolidating
courses of high-dose cytarabine (23 3 g/m2 iv on
Days 1 and 2) after achieving a complete response to
HDMTX. All patients also received dexamethasone at
a dose of 33 8 mg/day in the first course, and thereafter only if clinically indicated. The HDMTX dose
was adjusted to the patient’s creatinine clearance.11
All patients were followed longitudinally with
surveillance MRI or CT scans and neurologic examinations at regular intervals: Treatment response was
evaluated after the first and third BMPD treatment
course, after the third and sixth course of HDMTX
monotherapy, and every 3 months in the first year,
every 4 months in the second year, and every 6
months thereafter. Additional neuroradiologic evaluation was performed on clinical suspicion.
For late neurotoxicity evaluation, all patients
alive with no evidence of lymphoma were assessed
for brain atrophy and leukoencephalopathy based on
their most recent MRI scans by 1 of 2 experienced
neuroradiologists. Moreover, in addition to a complete neurologic examination, each patient and/or
his or her caregiver was asked about concentration
impairment, memory and orientation deficits, the
presence of ataxia and incontinence, the need for
help, and fitness for work, according to a specially
developed questionnaire.12 Cognitive deficits were
quantified as: 2 (absent), 1 (mild) 11 (moderate),
and 111 (severely compromised), and ataxia was
quantified as 2 (normal, no ataxia), 1 (mild ataxia),
and 11 (severe ataxia). The need for care was quantified as 2 (none), 1 (occasional), 11 (frequent), and
111 (permanent).
For statistical analysis, patient characteristics
were grouped according to previously published
prognostic factors: age 50 years and >50 years, age
60 years and >60 years, and age as a continuous
variable; KPS 70 and <70; 0 to 1 lesion and >1
lesion; and superficial and deep lesion location. In
addition, the MSKCC prognosis score, based on age
and KPS, was validated. Response to first treatment
was evaluated according to International Primary CNS
Lymphoma Study Group (IPCG) criteria13 and
grouped into ‘responders’ (complete response [CR]
and partial response [PR]) and ‘nonresponders’ (stable
or progressive disease) for statistical analysis. An elevated CSF cell count was defined as >5 cells/lL.14
Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time
from histologic diagnosis to first documentation of
disease progression on imaging or death from any
cause in patients responding (CR and PR) to first

therapy, progression-free survival (PFS) was defined
as the time from histologic diagnosis to first documentation of disease progression on imaging or
death from lymphoma in all patients, and overall
survival (OAS) was defined as the time from beginning of treatment to death from any cause, according
to the standardized response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.15 Depending on response to first
treatment, OAS was evaluated using the landmark
method, which defines the treatment response for a
specific timepoint (3 months) and only those
patients alive at this timepoint were included in the
analysis. This avoids potential bias because patients
with complete remission usually survive at least until
assessment of remission.16 Time periods for OAS and
EFS were calculated in months with 1-decimalpoint
accuracy; symptom duration before diagnosis was
measured in days.
EFS, PFS, and OAS were estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method.17 Group comparisons were
made using the log-rank test.18 The independent
prognostic value of variables was analyzed by Cox
stepwise regression model.19 The level of significance
was .05 (2-sided). In the current study, hazards ratios
of at least 2.5 could be detected with a power of at
least 80%. Commercially available statistical software
was used (SPSS for Windows, release 14.0; SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Seventy-two patients with a median age of 62 years
(range, 16–87 years) and a median KPS of 80%
(range, 10–100; mean 73%) were identified. Thirty of
these patients were pooled from 2 prospective studies, 13 of whom had been published previously.6 All
patients had parenchymal brain involvement except
for 2 patients with isolated intraocular lymphoma
and 2 patients with isolated meningeal lymphoma.
Concomitant ocular involvement was detected by slit
lamp examination in 2 of 12 patients examined. The
median symptom duration before diagnosis was 30
days (range, 1–400 days) (n 5 51). Six of 34 patients
(18%) in whom CSF analysis was performed had
cytomorphologic evidence of lymphoma cells. The
median cell count in the CSF was 6 (range, 0–237)
and the median protein level (n 5 23) was 760 mg/L
(range, 190–1990 mg/L). Patient characteristics are
given in Table 1.

apy and 19 in combination with other cytostatics (1
each in combination with ifosfamide and high-dose
cytarabine, and 17 patients in combination with carmustine and procarbazine). Twelve patients did not
receive HDMTX-based chemotherapy because of
poor physical condition or renal insufficiency; 4
received chemotherapy protocols without methotrexate (eg, topotecan or ifosfamide monotherapy), 3
received steroids only, and 5 were primarily treated
with WBI. In patients receiving HDMTX-based chemotherapy, 9 in addition received WBI as part of their
initial treatment.
Fifty-four of 69 patients receiving treatment
other than steroids only were evaluable for response
to first treatment. Thirty-five patients (65%) responded (52% with a CR and 13% with a PR), and
19 patients (35%) were nonresponders (5% with
stable disease [SD] and 30% with progressive disease
[PD]). Fifteen patients could not be evaluated for
response because of complete lymphoma resection
(n 5 3 patients), early deterioration and death without response evaluation (n 5 2 patients), or loss to
follow-up (n 5 10 patients).
In the subgroup treated with HDMTX alone, 20
of 34 patients (59%) responded (7 patients were not
evaluable) compared with 11 of 16 patients (69%) in
the subgroup treated with HDMTX-based combination chemotherapy (3 patients were not evaluable).

evaluation was performed. The details are presented
in Figure 1.

Overall Survival
The median follow-up was 58.7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 48.8–68.6 months). The median OAS for the entire whole study population was
41.4 months (95% CI, 32.3–50.6 months) (Fig. 2) and
was 42.5 months (95% CI, 38.2–46.8 months) for the
60 patients treated with HDMTX-based chemotherapy, 42.5 months (95% CI, 38–47 months) for patients
treated with HDMTX alone, and 41.4 months (95%
CI, 14.2–68.6 months) for those treated with an
HDMTX combination regimen. The median OAS for
patients not treated with HDMTX was 7.3 months
(95% CI, 0–15.4 months) and was 1.2 months for
those treated with steroids alone, 10.9 months for
those treated with alternative chemotherapy regimens, and 8.8 months for those treated with WBI
alone.
At last follow-up, 22 patients (31%) were alive
and 4 patients (6%) were lost to follow-up. Forty-six
patients (64%) died; the cause of death was evaluable
in 35 patients, was the result of PCNSL in 28 patients
(80%), from acute toxicity in 1 patient, a late treatment-related neurotoxicity in 4 patients (11%), and
other causes (heart failure and pulmonary embolism)

in 2 patients. Eleven of the surviving patients (50%)
were aged <60 years at the time of diagnosis.
The median overall survival of patients aged 60
years (n 5 31) was 45 months (95% CI, 38.7–51.3
months), which was significantly longer than that of
patients aged >60 years (n 5 41), which was 24.3
months (95% CI, 0–57.5 months) (P 5 .014, log-rank).

As nearly significant difference (P 5 .055) was found
between the survival of patients aged <50 years
(n 5 12) versus those aged 50 years (n 5 60), presumably because of the small number of patients.
Significant differences were observed when age was
tested as a continuous variable (P 5 .01). The median
OAS for patients with a KPS 70 (n 5 43) was 42.4
months (95% CI, 37–47.8 months), and was 6.2
months for patients with a KPS <70 (n 5 17) (95%
CI, 0–32.8 months) (P 5 .046, log-rank).
Forty-nine patients (30 treated with HDMTX
monotherapy, 15 treated with HDMTX combination
protocol, 3 treated with WBI only, and 1 patient treated with a regimen that did not contain HDMTX)
were evaluable for survival according to response to
first-line treatment (landmark method) after the
exclusion of 23 patients (3 of whom were treated
with steroids only, 3 of whom were treated with complete lymphoma resection, 7 of whom had early
death within 3 months of diagnosis, and 10 of whom
were lost to follow-up). The median OAS for patients
responding to first-line treatment (CR or PR; n 5 34)
was 45 months (95% CI, 39.1–50.9 months), and that
for patients without a response (SD or PD, n 5 15)
was 18 months (95% CI, 6 months to 30 months)
(P 5 .04, log-rank).
On multivariate analysis, age (as dichotomous
variable) and response to first-line treatment were
found to be the only independent prognostic factors
for OAS. No statistically significant difference in OAS
was noted for sex, number of lesions (0 or 1 vs >1),
location of the lesion (superficial vs deep), extent of
biopsy (no biopsy or stereotactic biopsy vs open
resection), or CSF cell count.
When the MSKCC score was used, significant differences between the 3 groups were found. The OAS
was 52.9 months (95% CI, 29.3–76.5 months) for
patients aged <50 years (n 5 12), 42.4 months (95%
CI, 30.8–54 months) for patients aged 50 years and
with a KPS 70 (n 5 34), and 5.2 months (95% CI,
2.4–8 months) for patients 50 years and with a KPS
<70 (n 5 15) (P 5 .009; log-rank test) (Fig. 3).

Long-term Survivors (>60 Months)
Eight patients (3 women and 5 men) with a median
age of 48 years (range, 19–76 years) and a median
KPS of 80 (range, 40–100) had survived 60 months
at the time of last follow-up. Of these patients, only
1 died of progressing lymphoma after 63.3 months,
and 1 patient was lost to follow-up after 66 months.
Six patients received initial HDMTX monotherapy and 2 patients HDMTX-based combination treatment. Two of these patients received WBI as part of
their initial therapy. Five patients developed disease

with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 1
(n 5 34) had a median overall survival of 42.4 months (95% CI, 30–854
months), and patients aged 50 years and with an ECOG performance score

recurrence at a median of 5 months (range, 3–39.7
months) after the initial diagnosis and all had prolonged (23.6–63 months; median, 57.9 months) survival after salvage therapy (WBI in 2 patients,
topotecan in 3 patients, and high-dose chemotherapy
with carmustine and thiotepa followed by autologous
stem cell transplantation in 1 patient). Of 7 patients
with complete follow-up data, 5 patients developed
treatment-related neurotoxicity.

Recurrence
Sixty of 72 patients (83%) experienced disease recurrence or progression (including death by any cause)
regardless of initial treatment response. Of the 35
patients responding to first-line treatment, 28 developed disease recurrence or progression (including
death by any cause), with a median EFS of 30.7
months (95% CI, 13.7–47.7 months). After the exclusion of patients with an unknown cause of death, 64
evaluable patients had a median PFS of 9 months
(95% CI, 3.7–14.3 months) (Fig. 4). No statistically
significant difference was found for either EFS or PFS
with respect to age or KPS.
Of 35 patients with initial response, 17 had an
isolated cerebral recurrence, 1 has an isolated intra-

ocular recurrence, 1 had a concomitant systemic and
cerebral recurrence, and 1 had an isolated systemic
recurrence. Both patients with PIOL developed cerebral disease recurrence. On the whole, systemic recurrence occurred in 4 patients (simultaneously in
the testes and kidney, and in the bones, stomach,
and lung/thoracic wall in 1 patient each).
Thirty-nine of 42 patients (93%) with disease
progression or recurrence (patients treated with steroids only, patients with unknown or unrelated death,
and patients with early death [3 months] were
excluded) received salvage therapy; 10 received WBI,
1 underwent orchiectomy, and 28 were treated with
chemotherapy alone (topotecan, high-dose cytarabine, ifosfamide, procarbazine, vincristine, or lomustine). Among the 28 patients treated with
chemotherapy at the time of first disease recurrence
or progression, 8 achieved a CR, 1 achieved a PR, 17
developed disease progression, and 1 died during
treatment (missing data for 1 patient). When WBI
was used as salvage treatment at the time of first disease recurrence, the median survival time (from
initiation of WBI until death) was 19.7 months
(range, 0.5–49.6 months) (n 5 10). When it was used
at the time of second disease recurrence, the median
survival was 5 months (range, 1.3–62 months)
(n 5 7). The median survival from the initiation of
salvage therapy was 13.5 months (range, 0–63
months). Twenty-eight patients received third-line
and consecutive treatments up to 7 treatment lines.

1817

Neurotoxicity
Seventeen of 20 patients who were alive without evidence of lymphoma 20.5 to 84 months after diagnosis were evaluated for late neurotoxicity, whereas 3
patients were not available for testing (Table 2). In
this patient subgroup, there were 9 women and 8
men with a median age of 56 years (range, 16–76
years) and a median initial KPS of 90 (range, 50–100).
Radiologic signs of neurotoxicity were detected on
the most recent MRI in 14 of these patients. According to the results of the questionnaire used, cognitive
deficits with impairment of concentration, memory,
and orientation were present in 11 patients, ataxia in
6 patients (no data available for 1 patient), and
incontinence in 1 patient. Seven of 11 patients who
worked before the diagnosis of PCNSL did not return
to work, and 8 patients needed care to varying
degrees, including a patient with persistent hemiparesis caused by lymphoma. On the whole, there was
a good correlation between the presence of radiologic and clinical abnormalities. Five of the 11 patients
with clinical signs of late neurotoxicity have received
WBI either initially or during the course of disease.

DISCUSSION
The current retrospective analysis provides a review of
all immunocompetent patients with newly diagnosed
PCNSL treated at our institution in the era of
HDMTX-based chemotherapy. The reported data refer
to an intent-to-treat population regardless of therapy
actually received. The only bias applying to the selection of patients is the referral bias, because patients in
smaller community hospitals might not have received
biopsy or not have been referred to our institution
because of poor physical condition. However, with a
median age of 62 years, a median KPS of 70, and 24%
of patients with a lower KPS, our cohort represents a
typical PCNSL population with regard to the most important prognostic factors. Several authors have retrospectively assessed the outcomes of PCNSL patients
from single institutions or based on multicenter (registry) data. In Table 3, single-center studies including
HDMTX as part of the primary therapy in >50% of all
patients are presented together with the current study.
The comparison of treatment in these trials and their
results appears to underscore the role of HDMTX as
part of the initial therapy and the importance of
adhering to therapy protocols in PCNSL patients
whenever possible.
Thirteen of our patients were treated within a
multicenter trial, with 56 patients treated at 28 German institutions. A median overall survival of only
11.5 months was found in this study, although the

entire study population was not negatively selected
with regard to patient age or performance status.6
However, the HDMTX infusion time of 24 hours
might have been suboptimal, according to more
recent findings concerning the use of methotrexate
in PCNSL.21,22 Similar results have been reported in
other multicenter analyses with a median OAS of 9
months and 17 months, respectively.2,3 This is most
likely because of a relatively small proportion of
patients treated with HDMTX (at a dose of >1 g/m2)
in these trials and supports our previous conclusion
that PCNSL patients should preferably be managed
at highly experienced centers.
We found younger age and response to first
treatment to be significantly associated with survival,
a finding that is consistent with previously published
prognostic factors. However, the 3 prognosis classes
created by MSKCC9 distinguished outcome with
higher statistical significance than any single prognostic factor both on univariate and multivariate
analysis. Thus, the current study data provide an
external validation of the MSKCC score. It is interesting to note that, with 52.9 months, the median OAS
of class 1 in our cohort was inferior to that of class 1
patients from MSKCC at a median of 102 months,
most likely supporting the front-line use of more intensive therapy regimens, including intraventricular
chemotherapy and WBI in younger patients, as is
usually practiced at the MSKCC.
With a long median follow-up of nearly 5 years,
we identified 8 long-term survivors (>60 months).
Two of them received chemotherapy followed by
WBI, and 6 patients had chemotherapy only as their
initial treatment. It is interesting to note that 5 of
them developed disease recurrence after a median of
5 months and were alive at a median of 58 months

after salvage therapy; 2 patients had been treated
with WBI, 2 patients had been treated with chemotherapy including topotecan, and 1 patient received
high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell
support (n 5 1). These findings emphasize that, with
adequate salvage therapy, long-term survival can be
achieved in patients with PCNSL, even in those
patients who develop early disease recurrence after
first-line treatment. At the time of disease recurrence,
not only WBI, but also an increasing number of cytostatic agents can be used successfully with a chance
of long-term survival, emphasizing the role of drugs
other than MTX in the management of PCNSL.
The relatively short PFS noted in the current
study may reflect the use of mild therapy regimens
as first-line treatment and the deferral of radiotherapy in the majority of patients. However, because of
effective salvage therapy, the high rate of initial treatment failure did not translate into inferior survival.
This is in line with previously published studies
deliberately deferring WBI at the expense of overall
response and failure-free survival but without compromising OAS.8,23
Late neurotoxicity is a potentially devastating
complication in PCNSL, particularly in older patients
and after intensive therapy.8 Unfortunately, to our
knowledge, well-conducted studies with a long-term
follow-up assessing cognitive status in patients after
different therapy modalities are lacking. Moreover,
psychometric tests established for other conditions
were not feasible in this study. Thus, we decided to
evaluate radiologic changes and clinical symptoms
most likely attributable to neurotoxicity using a specially designed questionnaire.11 With this method,
the risk of late neurotoxicity is likely underestimated
compared with prospective neuropsychologic testing.

The high frequency of late neurotoxicity and the correlation of clinical and radiologic findings in our study
are comparable to findings from studies with shorter
follow-up.5 Remarkably, in the group evaluated for
late neurotoxicity, 5 of 11 patients with clinical signs
of neurotoxicity received WBI compared with none of
6 patients without such deficits. The median age was
similar in both groups (57 years and 55 years, respectively). All 4 patients whose death was related to late
neurotoxicity had previously been treated with radiotherapy, 3 of them as part of their initial therapy. Conversely, of the 12 patients treated with chemotherapy
only (median age of 57 years), 4 patients had memory
deficits and 2 considerable deficits of concentration,
memory, and orientation. These findings highlight the
problem of late neurotoxicity in PCNSL and support
the deferral of radiotherapy as long as possible, particularly in elderly patients.
In conclusion, the mature data of the current
study demonstrate that a relatively moderate
HDMTX-based chemotherapy can result in prolonged survival and most likely cure, even in older
patients and those with early disease recurrence.
However, the probability of late neurotoxicity with
prolonged survival is considerable. Our results
underscore the importance of treating PCNSL
patients preferably at experienced institutions.
