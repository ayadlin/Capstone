ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal brain tumor associated with only 12%
median survival rate of patients. Despite the development of advanced surgical, radiation
or use of combinations of anti-cancer drugs, treatment for glioblastoma patients is still a
challenge. The major contributing factor in glioblastoma progression and resistive nature
is its ability to evade the immune surveillance. Hence, modulating the immune system
in glioblastoma tumors could be an important strategy for anticancer therapeutics.
Penfluridol, an antipsychotic drug has been shown to have anti-cancer properties in
our recently published studies. The present study evaluates the immune response of
penfluridol in glioblastoma tumors. Our results demonstrated that penfluridol treatment
significantly suppressed glioblastoma tumor growth. Our current results demonstrated
about 72% suppression of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with penfluridol
treatment in mouse bearing U87MG glioblastoma tumors. MDSCs are known to increase
regulatory T cells (Treg), which are immunosuppressive in nature and suppresses M1
macrophages that are tumor suppressive in nature. Our results also showed suppression
of regulatory T cells as well as elevation of M1 macrophages with penfluridol treatment by
58% and 57% respectively. Decrease in CCL4 as well as IFNγ with penfluridol treatment
was also observed indicating decrease in overall tumor inflammation. This is the first
report demonstrating immune modulations by penfluridol treatment associated with
glioblastoma tumor growth suppression prompting further investigation to establish
penfluridol as a treatment option for glioblastoma patients.

which play a critical role in glioblastoma tumor progression
and metastasis [2-4]. MDSCs are a heterogeneous group of
cells and are a major component of tumor microenvironment.
MDSCs, generated in bone marrow and in host bearing
tumors, migrate to lymphoid organs and tumors, and support
the formation of tumor microenvironment [5]. Acquired
resistance to chemotherapy is difficult to overcome during
cancer treatment. Induction and expansion of MDSCs play a
critical role in chemoresistance [6]. Currently, glioblastoma is

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a tumor that arises from
astrocytes [1]. Astrocytes are star shaped cells and are known
to support brain tissue. Glioblastoma tumors are highly
malignant and aggressive in nature because cells divide
quickly and are supported by a large network of blood vessels
providing nutrients [1]. Malignant glioblastoma is highly
infiltrated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),

difficult to manage by conventional chemotherapies. Hence,
new treatment option for glioblastoma is indispensable.
Like MDSCs, regulatory T cells (Treg) are also a part
of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [7]. The
association of regulatory T cells in overall poor prognosis of
several neoplasms has been established [8]. In addition, recent
studies demonstrated that MDSCs can also induce regulatory
T cells [9]. On the other hand, macrophages have critical role
in cancer progression, and play a key role in inflammation and
cancer [10]. Tumor-associated macrophages facilitate neoplastic
transformation as well as promote signaling cascades for
metastasis [11]. MDSCs and macrophages are present in most
solid tumors and play a critical role in overall inflammation and
immunosuppressive activity [12]. Cross-talk between MDSCs
and macrophages promote tumor prognosis by affecting antitumor immunity [12]. The resulting chronic inflammation can
predispose to cancer [13]. Several anti-inflammatory drugs have
been shown to have an anti-cancer effect [14]. Interestingly,
Baune et.al has demonstrated in a study that antipsychotic drugs
have an anti-inflammatory effect [15].
Penfluridol, an antipsychotic drug has been
demonstrated by us to inhibit the growth of metastatic
breast tumors in brain [16]. In another study, we observed
that penfluridol significantly suppresses the growth of
various glioblastoma tumor cells in vitro and in vivo [17].
In the current study, we evaluated immune consequences
of penfluridol treatment associated with inhibiting
glioblastoma tumor growth.
Our results show substantial growth suppression
of glioblastoma tumors and MDSC levels by penfluridol
treatment. In addition, penfluridol treatment reduced Tregs
and enhanced M1 macrophages. This is the first report of
immune modulation by penfluridol treatment associated
with suppression of glioblastoma tumor growth.

of MDSCs are also known to regulate stem cells like
characteristics in tumors. We used CD11b and Gr1 markers
to analyze mouse MDSCs after treatment of mice with
10mg/kg penfluridol by oral gavage everyday till day
48. Blood from control and penfluridol treated mice was
collected and PBMCs were separated. MDSCs were
analyzed by gating on forward and side scattered profile
of the cells using flow cytometer. We observed a 72%
reduction of mouse MDSCs with penfluridol treatment
(Figure 1D). This observation indicated that penfluridol
treatment suppressed MDSCs, which play a significant role
in promoting tumor growth.

Modulation in spleen weight with penfluridol
treatment
The spleen is a peripheral immune organ and plays a
critical role in regulating the immune system of the body.
Shrinkage of spleen as well as inhibition of spleen cell
proliferation has been observed in late stage tumors where
the immune system is suppressed [18, 19]. Our results
showed that the average weight of spleens in mice treated
with penfluridol was modestly increased as compared to
the spleens from control mice (Figure 2A-2B), indicating
that penfluridol may have increased splenic cells
proliferation, which correlate with inhibition of tumor
growth associated with immune system.

Suppression of regulatory T cells by penfluridol
treatment

To determine the efficacy of penfluridol in inhibiting
the growth of glioblastoma, U87MG glioblastoma cells
were implanted subcutaneously on both flanks of athymic
nude mice. Once each mouse attained about 70-100mm3
tumors, mice were randomly divided into two groups.
Control mice received vehicle only whereas the treatment
group of mice received 10mg/kg penfluridol everyday by
oral gavage. The experiment was terminated at day 48 due
to excessive tumor burden in control mice. After 48 days
of penfluridol treatment, glioblastoma tumor growth was
suppressed by 65% (Figure 1A-1C).

Translation of mouse data to human fails due to
significant differences in mouse and human immune
systems. In order to confirm effects of penfluridol treatment
on human immune system, we injected 40 x 106 human
PBMCs (isolated from human blood) intraperitoneally in
SCID-NOD mice. A week after human PBMC injection,
each mouse was injected with 1 x 106 U87MG glioblastoma
cells subcutaneously. Penfluridol 10mg/kg was administered
to mice everyday by oral gavage once tumor volume
reached around 70-100 mm3, whereas the control group of
mice received vehicle only. The experiment was terminated
at day 40 due to excessive tumor burden in the control
group of mice. After termination of the experiment, PBMCs
were collected from the blood of control and penfluridol
treated mice and double stained with FoxP3 and CD4
antibodies for regulatory T cells (Treg). Our results show
that penfluridol treatment reduced regulatory T cells (Treg)
by 58%, indicating an increase in immune surveillance in
mice bearing human tumors (Figure 3).

single cell suspension using a tumor dissociation kit and
gentle MACS Dissociator. Single cell suspension from
control and penfluridol treated tumors were processed
and analyzed after double staining with CD86 and IL12
antibodies for antigens present on M1 macrophages. M1

macrophages are known to be involved in tumor growth
suppression [20]. Our results demonstrated that penfluridol
treatment resulted in a 57% increase of M1 macrophages
as compared to control tumors (Figure 4A). Interestingly,
we did not observe any change in the cells stained with
CD88 expression, a marker of macrophages [21].

Penfluridol suppressed tumor inflammation

[22, 23]. Our results demonstrated that penfluridol
treatment resulted in 54% and 49% reduction of CCL4 and
IFNγ respectively, indicating suppression of inflammation
in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 5A-5B).

As chronic inflammation plays a significant role in
tumor progression, we decided to analyze inflammatory
markers in the tumor microenvironment after penfluridol
treatment. Subcutaneously implanted U87MG tumors
from SCID-NOD mice injected with human PBMCs were
examined for inflammatory markers after terminating
the experiment. Tumors obtained from control and
penfluridol treated mice were lysed and ELISA assay
was performed for IFNγ and CCL4. IFNγ and CCL4
are known to play critical roles in tumor progression

DISCUSSION
Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest cancers.
Currently, radiation and chemotherapy are the available
treatments for glioblastoma, however, glioblastoma
cells are radioresistant and chemoresistant leading

to reoccurrence after conventional therapy [24]. The
immune system’s natural ability to recognize and kill
abnormal cells in the body may prevent development of
cancer. However, cancer cells evade immune response by
inducing several immune cells that can suppress natural
defense of the body [25]. Tumor progression has long been
associated with chronic inflammatory microenvironment
and infiltration of MDSCs [26]. MDSCs infiltration of
the tumor microenvironment has also been associated
with glioblastoma stem cells characteristics [27]. In
addition, glioblastoma progression is connected with
immunosuppression driven by elevation in Treg and
MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment [26]. Elevated
Treg in peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment has
been associated with tumor progression. Temozolomide, an
FDA approved drug against glioblastoma has been known
to reduce circulating Treg further increasing the activity
of cytotoxic T cells against tumors [28, 29]. Furthermore,
macrophages are known to be associated with MDSCs
and involved in inflammation and immunosuppressive
effects in the tumor microenvironment [12]. Overall,
glioblastoma tumors create an immunosuppressive
environment and engage several pathways to evade innate
immune surveillance.
In our previous study, we demonstrated that
penfluridol treatment significantly suppressed the growth
of metastatic breast tumors in brain [16]. Our results
from another study showed that 10mg/kg penfluridol
everyday by oral gavage suppressed the growth of

glioblastoma tumors in a subcutaneous and intracranial
model [17]. In the current study, we evaluated immune
modulations after treatment with penfluridol. Several lines
of evidence have suggested that chronic inflammation
predisposes to cancer [13]. Our results demonstrated
that oral administration of 10mg/kg penfluridol everyday
for 48 days reduced mouse MDSCs by 72%. Generally,
chemotherapy is associated with immune suppression
in the patients. Polysaccharides, such as ginseng, when
used in combination with anti-cancer drugs was shown to
improve drug induced immunosuppression [30]. Beneficial
effect of polysaccharide in combination with anti-cancer
drugs was associated with increase in spleen weight and
stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation [30]. Similarly to
these studies, we also observed a minor increase in spleen
weight with penfluridol treatment indicating increased
splenic activity and immune stimulation, which may have
led to enhanced immune surveillance to inhibit tumor
growth.
Different animal models are used to mimic human
disease, however, in most of the cases, translation of
mouse data to human fails due to significant differences
between mouse and human immune systems [31].
We therefore evaluated the effect of penfluridol in
glioblastoma tumors by injecting human PBMCs in SCIDNOD mice prior to human tumor implantation. MDSCs
inhibit adaptive immunity of the body by inducing Treg
cells [32]. Treg cells are CD4+ T cells with elevated
FOXP3 and are known to suppress innate immune

cells were injected i.p. in 100 μL PBS in SCID-NOD mice. The treatment group received 10mg/kg penfluridol by oral gavage everyday;
control mice received vehicle alone. Modulation of regulatory T (Treg) cells was monitored by immunostaining and fluorescence cytometry
to determine the effects of penfluridol. Values were plotted as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t test.

responses [33]. Our results showed that penfluridol
treatment by oral gavage reduced Treg cells in SCIDNOD mouse injected with human PBMCs. Macrophages,
primarily M1 and M2, subtypes are a major source
of inflammatory cytokines. M1 macrophages secrete
interleukin 12 (IL-12) that helps in generation of T helper
1 (TH-1) adaptive immunity to directly induce cytotoxic
effects in tumor cells [34]. M2 macrophages are immune
suppressive in nature, contribute to matrix remodeling and

hence support tumor growth [35]. M1 macrophages are
characterized by high expression of CD86 and IL-12 [36].
In our study, we observed that tumor growth suppression
by penfluridol treatment was associated with increased
M1 macrophages, which may have led to induction of
cytotoxic effect in tumor cells.
Inflammation has long been associated with
tumor growth [37]. It plays critical role in modulating
immune surveillance and hence altered response to

tumors in SCID-NOD mice were removed from control and penfluridol treated mice at day 40. Tumors were processed and suspended

therapy. Infiltrating macrophages have been established
as the critical component of inflammation during tumor
progression. It has also been established that CCL4
plays a crucial role in macrophage-mediated tumorigenic
signaling [22]. In our current study, we observed that
penfluridol treatment reduced infiltrating human CCL4 in
the tumor microenvironment by 54% in SCID-NOD mice
injected with human PBMCs. Under certain conditions,

IFNγ plays critical role in anti-tumor host immunity and
supports tumor growth [23]. In a few clinical trials, IFNγ
treatment negatively affected patients outcome whereas in
other trials, it provided positive effect in cancer patients
[23]. Thus IFNγ has been established to have dual role:
one as a hallmark of anti-tumor immunity and another to
support tumor growth by immune escape phenomena, a
mechanism mediated through PD-L-1 expression [23].

were lysed and protein concentration was estimated in different control and penfluridol treated tumor lysate. Equal amount of protein was

Interestingly, we observed that penfluridol significantly
suppressed human IFNγ in the tumor microenvironment
in SCID-NOD mice injected with human PBMCs and
implanted with human U87MG glioblastoma tumors.
In summary, suppression of GBM tumor growth
correlated with reduction of immune suppressive
cells (Treg and MDSC), an increase of tumor killing
macrophages (M1), and reduction of markers of
chronic inflammation (CCL4 and IFNγ) in the tumor
microenvironment. We suggest that immune enhancement
may have been involved in inhibition of tumor growth
of glioblastoma. This is the first report, demonstrating
immune modulation with penfluridol treatment associated
with glioblastoma tumor growth inhibition. An imbalance
in the immune system during tumor progression is
associated with chemoresistant tumors and our study lays
the foundation of effective treatment for glioblastoma by
immune modulation. Our study further supports future
clinical development of immunotherapies to suppress
glioblastoma and preclinical investigation of combining
temozolomide and penfluridol and other immune
modulatory agents to attempt to eliminate glioblastoma.

which was further diluted in water/PEG300/ethanol/2%
acetic acid in 8:3:0.13:1 v/v [38]. Tumor volume was
measured twice a week till day 48 by using vernier caliper
and as described by us before [16, 39]. At day 48, mice
were humanely sacrificed and tumors were removed.
The results of this experiment have been published by us
recently [17]. A part of the tumor from this experiment
was used for current study.

PBMC collection from mouse blood and flow
cytometric analysis
To evaluate the effect of penfluridol treatment
on immune cells, blood was collected from control
and treatment group. The blood collected from each
mouse by cardiac puncture was diluted 10 fold with
RBC lysis buffer and incubated for 15 minutes at room
temperature on a shaker. RBC lysis step was repeated in
case complete lysis not achieved. After lysis of RBCs,
cells were washed with PBS followed by a second
washing with FACS buffer (2% heat inactivated fetal
bovine serum and 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) in PBS) as described before by us [40].
PBMC from each mouse were equally divided into two
groups. Each set of cells was re-suspended in an equal
volume of FACS buffer. CD11b Gr-1 FoxP3, CD4,
CD86, IL12 and CD88 antibodies were purchased
from Miltenyi Biotech. The samples were first blocked
using blocking reagent for 15 minutes at 4˚C in dark.
After blocking, cells were washed and suspended
in FACS buffer. After suspension in FACS buffer,
appropriate antibodies were added and samples were
incubated for 30 minutes on ice in dark. The samples
were then washed and re-suspended in 300μL of FACS
buffer. Accuri C6 flow cytometer software was used to
analyze the effect of penfluridol treatment on MDSCs,
regulatory T cells (Treg) and macrophages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Experiments in mice were conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards and according to approved
protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC), Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center, Amarillo, Texas.

Cell culture
U87MG glioblastoma cells used in this study
were purchased from ATCC and maintained in EMEM
supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% PSN. Cells used in
the experiments were within twenty passages after receipts
or resuscitation.

Human PBMC isolation from buffy coat
Healthy human buffy cones from anonymous
donors were obtained from Coffee Memorial Blood
Bank, Amarillo, TX. Samples from each buffy cone
were diluted with PBS to make final volume of 50ml.
Diluted samples were divided into two tubes with 25ml
each, after which, 15ml PBS was further added. Samples
were gently layered over 10-15ml Ficoll-Paque reagent
(GE Lifesciences) as described by us before [40].
Samples were gently centrifuged for 40minutes at 400
x g maintaining 20˚C temperature and without applying
any brakes. A clear band of PBMCs was observed at
the interface of Ficoll and plasma, and this band was
collected. The collected PBMCs were washed with PBS
and incubated at 37°C with red blood cell (RBC) lysis
buffer. The cells were then centrifuged, washed with PBS
and collected.

U87MG subcutaneous implantation
4-6 week old female athymic nude mice were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Livermore, CA).
IACUC approved the use of athymic nude mice. All the
experiments were performed under the strict compliance
and regulations. As described by us previously, 100µL cell
suspension containing 1x106 U87MG cells in 1:1 mixture
of PBS and matrigel were implanted in both flanks of
mice. Mice were divided into two groups with 5 mice in
each group once tumor volume reached around 70-100
mm3. Group I served as control and received the vehicle
only whereas group II received 10mg/kg/day penfluridol
by oral gavage. Penfluridol was purchased from SigmaAldrich and stock of penfluridol was made in DMSO
