BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was the first agent to demonstrate improved survival in previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma in a phase 3 trial (MDX010-20). Ipilimumab produced a characteristic spectrum of immune-related adverse events
(irAEs) of special interest, consistent with its immune-based mechanism of action. METHODS: In MDX010-20, 676 previously treated
patients were randomized 3:1:1 to receive ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus the glycoprotein 100 melanoma antigen vaccine (gp100), ipilimumab 3 mg/kg þ placebo, or gp100 vaccine þ placebo. For the current report, the authors conducted a detailed analysis of the time
to onset and resolution of irAEs associated with ipilimumab therapy. RESULTS: Grade 2 through 5 irAEs generally developed during
the induction phase of treatment (0-12 weeks). Most, including grade 3/4 irAEs, were reversible when managed with treatment guidelines using vigilant monitoring and corticosteroids. The median time to resolution (to grade 1 or 0 or to the grade at baseline) of irAEs
that had an onset during the induction phase was approximately 6 weeks for grade 2 through 4 irAEs and 8 weeks for grade 3 and 4
irAEs. Across the entire study duration, most grade 2 through 4 irAEs resolved within 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Most ipilimumabassociated irAEs, including grade 3/4 symptoms, developed within 12 weeks of initial dosing and resolved within 12 weeks of onset.

INTRODUCTION
Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), was the
first agent to demonstrate a survival benefit in previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma in a phase 3 trial.1 In
the MDX010-20 trial, induction treatment with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy significantly improved overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio for death compared with the glycoprotein 100 melanoma antigen [gp100] alone, 0.66; P ¼ .003).
Rates of OS in the ipilimumab group and the gp100 group were 45.6% and 25.3% at 12 months and 23.5% and 13.7%
at 24 months, respectively.1 On the basis of that study, ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for patients with metastatic melanoma and by the European Commission for previously treated patients
with metastatic melanoma.
CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation and proliferation that acts to limit immune responses and
dampen autoimmunity.2,3 CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated immunomodulatory effect
to enhance tumor-specific immune responses, but it also removes CTLA-4-mediated protection from autoimmunity,
resulting in increased or excessive immune activity (Fig. 1). Consequently, ipilimumab treatment typically induces drugrelated adverse events (AEs) of special interest that potentially have immune-related etiologies, classified in MDX010-20
and herein as immune-related AEs (irAEs). During phase 2 trials of ipilimumab, these most commonly comprised gastrointestinal (GI), skin, endocrine, or liver toxicities.2,4
Most irAEs are grade 1 or 2 and can be managed using protocol-specific treatment guidelines; however, early diagnosis,
vigilant follow-up, and appropriate management, including the use of systemic, high-dose corticosteroids, are essential to
minimize life-threatening complications of these side-effects. It is important for oncologists to become familiar with ipilimumab irAEs in both the type and the timing of their development so that published algorithms can be applied effectively.

Figure 1. The mechanism of action of ipilimumab is illustrated.

Herein, we present a detailed safety analysis of data from
the phase 3 MDX010-20 study, specifically regarding patterns of development and resolution of irAEs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Full details of the study design, inclusion and exclusion
criteria, and treatment have been published previously
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00094653).1 Briefly, in
total, 676 patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma who had received previous treatment with 1 or
more regimens of dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, carboplatin, or interleukin-2 were randomized 3:1:1
to receive ipilimumab þ gp100 peptide vaccine
(n ¼ 403), ipilimumab alone (n ¼ 137), or gp100 alone
(n ¼ 136). Ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg was administered every
3 weeks for up to 4 treatments (induction). Patients could
be retreated upon disease progression with their original
treatment if they had stable disease of 6 months’ duration (from baseline) or if they had a confirmed objective
response, no grade 3 irAEs that precluded further ipilimumab dosing, and no grade 4 toxicity.
AEs were graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 3.0. Characterization of AEs as immunerelated required the investigator to consider the event
treatment-related and for it to be included in a preassembled list of AEs with known inflammatory etiology.
Protocol-defined management of irAEs included the
1676

administration of corticosteroids (orally or intravenously),
a delay in a scheduled dose, or discontinuation of therapy.
Doses were delayed in the case of nondermatologic grade
2 irAEs until the event improved to grade 1 or lower; if
the event did not improve to grade 1 or lower, then treatment was discontinued permanently. Patients discontinued treatment if they experienced any nonskin-related
grade 3 AEs considered to be related to ipilimumab
treatment (with the exception of potentially reversible
grade <4 inflammation or endocrinopathies in which
clinical symptoms could be controlled with appropriate
hormone-replacement therapy) or if they had any
grade 4 AEs.1,5
Analyses were performed to evaluate the time to
onset and resolution of irAEs reported during the induction phase (from the day of the first dose to the day before
retreatment or 70 days after the last induction dose,
whichever came first) or for the entire study duration
(from the day of the first dose to 70 days after the last
dose, regardless of treatment phase). Here, we primarily
focus on those patients who received the subsequently
approved induction regimen of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses.

acute respiratory distress syndrome [n ¼ 1]).

(80%) had a treatment-related AE, and 80 of those patients
(61%) reported an irAE of any grade (Table 1), as previously reported by Hodi et al.1 The respective results for
patients who received ipilimumab plus gp100 were 338
patients (89%) with treatment-related AEs and 221
patients (58%) with irAEs. Most irAEs were grade 1 or 2,
although some life-threatening irAEs were observed, and
approximately 10% to 15% of ipilimumab-treated patients
reported grade 3/4 events. Among all 643 patients, it
appeared that 14 deaths were related to the study drugs
(2.2%), of which half were associated with irAEs, comprising bowel perforation (n ¼ 1) and liver failure (n ¼ 1) for
ipilimumab monotherapy; and colitis and septicemia
(n ¼ 1); bowel perforation/inflammatory colitis, bowel
perforation, or multiorgan failure/peritonitis (n ¼ 3);
and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n ¼ 1) for combined
ipilimumab plus gp100. Details of these 7 patients are
provided below.
Case 1

A woman aged 77 years had grade 3 diarrhea, colitis,
fever, and neutrophilia before the planned fourth induction dose of ipilimumab monotherapy, which was postponed. After the failure of broad spectrum antibiotics to
resolve the symptoms, intravenous corticosteroids were
initiated, leading to a rapid improvement in symptoms.
The patient was discharged 3 days later on a nontapering
oral daily dose of 65 mg prednisone. Ipilimumab was discontinued because of disease progression, and the patient
started treatment with temozolomide plus continued oral
corticosteroid therapy. Approximately 6 weeks later, the
patient was readmitted to hospital with abdominal pain,
Cancer

dehydration, and acute sigmoid diverticulitis, which
resolved after supportive care, antibiotics, and a decrease
in steroid dose. The patient started treatment with dacarbazine but was subsequently readmitted with a perforated
bowel. This was 136 days after the last ipilimumab dose
and 2 months after the last documented use of steroids,
with no complaints of diarrhea or constipation in the
meantime. The patient was given palliative support and
died 3 days later.
Case 2

A man aged 62 years who had widely metastatic disease to the spleen, liver, stomach, lymph nodes, and soft
tissue was admitted to hospital 24 days after receiving his
first dose of ipilimumab monotherapy with worsening
liver and renal function, pain, and dehydration. He was
treated for sepsis associated with multiorgan failure and
possible tumor lysis syndrome. Despite broad spectrum
antibiotics, intubation, and intensive support, he died the
next day.
Case 3

Shortly after his third dose of ipilimumab plus
gp100, a man aged 70 years developed diarrhea that was
unresponsive to atropine plus diphenoxylate and oral
budesonide. Three weeks later, acute colitis was confirmed by biopsy. The patient was admitted to hospital
with ongoing diarrhea and dehydration, and intravenous
corticosteroids were initiated. After being discharged after
5 days with oral prednisone and budesonide, the patient
was readmitted 2 days later with recurrent bloody diarrhea
and findings suggestive of a lacunar stroke. Intravenous
1677

corticosteroids were reinitiated; and, after receiving treatment for steroid-induced complications and testosterone
deficiency, the patient was discharged. Less than 2 weeks
later, the patient had grade 3 diarrhea and was subsequently readmitted with fever and lethargy because of
Escherichia coli septicemia. He was treated with antibiotics
and supportive care and died approximately 1 week later.
Case 4

A woman aged 58 years experienced grade 1 diarrhea
and vomiting after receiving 4 doses of ipilimumab plus
gp100. The diarrhea was treated with atropine and diphenoxylate; however, the patient presented to an emergency
room approximately 3 weeks later with rectal bleeding.
Although intravenous corticosteroids and appropriate
fluid and blood resuscitation were provided, the patient
did not inform the attending staff of her involvement in
the study; therefore, protocol-specific irAE management
was not initiated. Five days after hospitalization, acute colitis and pneumoperitoneum were confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. The patient underwent total colectomy
and ileostomy for pancolitis, perforation, and acute peritonitis; and an ulcerated melanoma lesion invading the
retroperitoneal muscles was resected. However, the
patient further deteriorated and died 3 days later.
Case 5

A man aged 59 years who already was hospitalized
and was being treated for pain and constipation with dexamethasone and gabapentin became acutely ill with fever,
vomiting, and acute renal failure shortly after receiving his
second dose of ipilimumab plus gp100. The patient
remained hypotensive despite fluid replacement and had
free air identified under the diaphragm on chest x-ray. He
died the following day as a result of bowel perforation.
Case 6

A man aged 69 years was receiving symptomatic
treatment for diarrhea, having completed his induction
therapy with ipilimumab plus gp100. Afterward, he presented with dysphagia and 5 or 6 bloody movements per
day. Although immediate hospitalization was refused, the
patient was admitted to hospital the next day, and rehydration and intravenous dexamethasone were initiated.
An emergency laparotomy identified purulent, malodorous ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis with involvement of the sigmoid colon and ileum associated with
ischemic colon and a sigmoid perforation. Sigmoid pathology revealed ulcerating colitis and perforation and
infiltrates of an epitheloid cell neoplasm on the serous
1678

membrane. The patient died the following day of multiorgan failure because of peritonitis.
Case 7

After completing his induction treatment with ipilimumab plus gp100, a man aged 62 years developed progressive neurologic symptoms. After hospitalization, he
developed dyspnea and, on electromyography, demonstrated distal and proximal axonal disturbances consistent
with Guillain-Barre syndrome. High-dose intravenous
immunoglobulin was initiated; but, after a transient
improvement, dyspnea worsened, and the patient subsequently died from respiratory failure.
Types of Immune-Related Adverse Events

Overall, among all ipilimumab-treated patients, irAEs
most frequently affected the skin and GI tract. Skin-related
irAEs of any grade were reported in 209 of 511 patients
(41%) and most commonly included pruritus, rash, and erythema. GI disorders were reported by 160 of 511 patients
(31%) and most commonly included diarrhea and colitis.
Endocrine disorders were the third most commonly
reported irAE, with 25 of 511 ipilimumab-treated patients
(5%) having an irAE of any grade. Of these, 5 patients who
received ipilimumab monotherapy had 1 or more grade 3/
4 event, the details of which are provided in Table 2.
Time to Onset and Resolution of ImmuneRelated Adverse Events

The vast majority of irAEs, including grade 3/4 events,
developed during the induction period, ie, within 12
weeks of initial dosing, with a median time to resolution
of 6 to 8 weeks (Table 3). Among 94 patients who
remained alive 2 years after the start of on-study treatment
(54, 24, and 16 patients in the ipilimumab plus gp100,
ipilimumab monotherapy, and gp100 monotherapy
groups, respectively) 5 patients (9.3%), 1 patient (4.2%),
and 1 patient (6.3%), respectively, reported an irAE >70
days after their last dose of study drug. All were grade 1 or
2 in severity (vitiligo, hypothyroidism, diarrhea, proctitis,
low blood testosterone, and hypogonadism), with the
exception of 1 patient in the ipilimumab plus gp100
group who experienced grade 3 colitis on day 147 that
recovered with residual effects.
The frequency of irAEs observed among 40
retreated patients in the MDX010-20 trial was similar to
that observed during their initial treatment. Overall, irAEs
were reported by 15 of 29 patients (51.7%) in the ipilimumab plus gp100 arm, 7 of 9 patients (77.8%) in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm, and 1 of 2 patients (50%) in
the gp100 arm.

Management of Immune-Related Adverse
Events

Most irAEs, including grade 3/4 events, were managed successfully according to protocol treatment guidelines,
including careful monitoring and the early receipt of corticosteroids. Nearly all treated patients (625 of 643; 97.2%)
received at least 1 concomitant medication during the study
(Table 4). Overall, analgesics were reported as concomitant
medication for 50% of patients in each treatment group.
Among the commonly reported concomitant medications,
antiemetics and antacids were received by a similar proportion of patients across treatment groups, whereas antibacterials, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and antidiarrheals
were received by more patients in the ipilimumab-treated
groups than patients in the gp100-treated groups. The
overall rate of receipt of systemic corticosteroids in the 2
ipilimumab treatment groups was approximately 10%
greater than in the gp100 group. Likewise, antihistamines
were frequently received for the management of skin symptoms, such as rash and pruritis.
A post hoc clinical review of patients with grade 3
GI or liver irAEs was performed, comprising 35 patients
(24 who received ipilimumab plus gp100, 10 who
received ipilimumab monotherapy, and 1 who received
gp100) who had at least 1 GI irAE and 8 patients (4 who
received ipilimumab plus gp100, 1 who received ipilimumab monotherapy, and 3 who received gp100) who had at

least 1 hepatic event. Among those who had a GI event,
75% received steroid therapy within 10 days of event onset,
15% received steroid treatment more than 10 days after
event onset, and approximately 10% (4 patients) received
no steroid treatment. Only 5 patients required the addition
of infliximab, an antibody against tumor necrosis factor-a,
to manage the GI irAE, and all 5 demonstrated some
improvement upon intervention. The rate of steroid treatment was lower for hepatic events than for GI events, and
only 3 of 8 patients received steroid treatment (all within
10 days). However, the presence of liver metastases at baseline in 4 of these patients may have complicated decisionmaking regarding the use of steroids for hepatic events.
DISCUSSION
Immune-related adverse events are mechanism-based
events that occur with ipilimuma; they most commonly
affect the skin and GI tract, and, less commonly, they
affect the liver, endocrine system, and nervous system.
Most irAEs in MDX010-20 were low grade, although
some were life-threatening. Of 14 treatment-related
deaths, 7 were considered attributable to immune-based
mechanisms and were characterized as irAEs.1 With the
1680

exception of case 2, which was difficult to clearly attribute
to ipilimumab, and the patient with Guillain-Barre syndrome, all patients who died after receiving ipilimumab
had severe GI events; most commonly colitis.
There is no evidence that bowel involvement in
patients with melanoma increases the likelihood that colitis,
especially dose-limiting colitis, will occur after receiving ipilimumab. Major issues that predispose patients to a worse
outcome when colitis occurs, and must be considered by the
treating oncologist, include prolonged time to reporting of
the symptoms, exacerbation of grade 1 or 2 diarrhea after
each dose, not holding a scheduled dose when grade 2 diarrhea is still present, and noncompliance with antidiarrheal
instruction and regimens. The key to handling ipilimumabassociated colitis is rapid and timely intervention mediated
by a high level of communication between staff and patients.
In at least 2 of the deaths resulting from colitis, there
was a delay of 3 weeks from the onset of symptoms to the
initiation of steroid treatment. In a retrospective analysis
of 836 patients who received ipilimumab at doses of 3
mg/kg or 10 mg/kg within clinical trials, the initiation of
steroid treatment within 5 days of the onset of enterocolitis symptoms led to faster resolution than when steroid

Figure 2. The proposed time course of typical immune-related
adverse events during treatment with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg is
illustrated (see Weber JS, Kahler KC, Hauschild A. Management of immune-related adverse events and kinetics of
response with ipilimumab. J Clin Oncol. 2012;30:2691-269713).

treatment was delayed for more than 5 days.6 These findings highlight the importance of 1) monitoring patients
for GI signs and symptoms from the moment ipilimumab
treatment is initiated, 2) careful and continuous monitoring for life-threatening side effects beyond the initial treatment period, and 3) involving a multidisciplinary team of
specialists, including gastroenterologists, to consult and
advise on appropriate patient management.
Immune-related adverse events that affect the endocrine system also are worthy of discussion, because they pose
significant difficulties in terms of management. Hypophysitis is the second most common high-grade or dose-limiting
irAE. It can result in profound symptomatology and is easily
reversible with proper treatment. However, endocrinopathies often masquerade as nonspecific conditions ascribed to
other causes. In these patients, appropriate medical intervention may be delayed or misguided. Therefore, the inclusion
of an endocrinologist in the multidisciplinary management
of patients who receive ipilimumab is warranted.
Most irAEs related to ipilimumab were manageable
using protocol-specific treatment guidelines, which rely on
prompt intervention and the use of oral and/or parenteral
corticosteroids. Steroids do not seem to interfere with ipilimumab efficacy once an irAE has occurred7-9; however, the
reasons for this are not well understood. Steroids are potent
immunosuppressive drugs that are generally withheld from
cancer patients who are receiving immunotherapy because
of concerns that they may inhibit immune-mediated tumor
regression.10,11 When a glucocorticoid known to deplete
lymphocytes was administered to mice receiving immunotherapy, however, it had no effect on T-cell-mediated tumor regression.10 Steroids have diverse effects involving
different components of the immune system; including
some that are immune-enhancing, such as the inhibition of
immune-activated cell death.10 Therefore, although steroid

treatment could abrogate or down-modulate an immune
response to ipilimumab, it is possible the response will not
be entirely inhibited.10,12
Onset of the majority of irAEs occurred during the
12-week induction phase of treatment, consistent with
the results from other ipilimumab studies (Tables 3, 5;
Fig. 2). Previous work suggests that irAEs may have a
characteristic pattern of onset, which is consistent among
patients who received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (Table 5, Fig. 2).13,14 In patients who
received ipilimumab 10 mg/kg, irAEs affecting the skin
typically were observed after an average of 3 to 4 weeks,
effects involving the GI tract and liver were observed after
6 or 7 weeks, and endocrine events were observed after 9
weeks.14,15 Skin and endocrine disorders appear to be the
most persistent, whereas GI symptoms are the quickest to
resolve despite also being the most likely to result in complications if uncontrolled (through bowel perforation and
peritonitis or obstruction). The late onset of some irAEs
compared with others is currently unexplained. A recent
study with ipilimumab indicated an association between
clinical response, a dermatologic irAE, and clonal expansion of Melan-A–specific T cells.16 Because Melan-A is an
antigen shared by melanoma cells and normal melanocytes, and because the naive T-cell repertoire in humans
contains Melan-A–specific clonal precursors, this may
explain why skin toxicity arises before other irAEs and
supports the hypothesis that ipilimumab breaks peripheral tolerance to both tumor and self-antigens.
The etiology for GI toxicity is less clear. It has been
demonstrated that ipilimumab produces a unique pattern
of dysregulation of GI mucosal immunity distinct from
that reported in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis,
although the precise mechanisms for this are unknown.17
Given the well documented involvement of regulatory T
cells in gut immune homeostasis and the role of CTLA-4
in regulatory T-cell function in the GI microenvironment,18 it is possible that, by blocking CTLA-4,

ipilimumab also inhibits the tolerogenic effects of regulatory T cells in the GI tract, resulting in immune-mediated
inflammation. This may explain the longer time to onset
of GI irAEs compared with skin toxicity as well as the
more rapid resolution.
Less frequent events (for example, endocrine irAEs)
tend to take longer to develop and then persist. In an adjuvant trial of 75 patients with melanoma who received with
ipilimumab, 11 patients had grade 2 or 3 hypophysitis
that required replacement corticosteroids. Six patients
required treatment for at least 2 years, including 1 patient
who remained symptom-free with 5 years of corticosteroid therapy. It is noteworthy that 3 of those patients were
weaned from systemic steroids, indicating that a requirement for steroid therapy resulting from ipilimumabrelated endocrinopathies need not be permanent.19
Although most patients develop only mild-to-moderate irAEs, careful follow-up and early intervention are
advised to address any symptoms and to prevent potentially serious complications. When historic safety data
from early clinical studies of ipilimumab were compared
with data from later studies, for example, the incidence of
bowel perforation decreased from 0.9% to 0.5%, and the
decline was attributed to the implementation and consistent use of treatment guidelines for irAE management and
to the increasing experience of practitioners.15,20
Although the data from this analysis fit with observations from phase 2 and other studies, they require confirmation from larger analyses and/or clinical observation
during more widespread use of ipilimumab. Physicians,
practitioners, and oncology nurses must exercise vigilance
to ensure that patients who receive ipilimumab are well
informed and educated so they can report symptoms
promptly; this is essential to prevent potentially lifethreatening complications from irAEs.
