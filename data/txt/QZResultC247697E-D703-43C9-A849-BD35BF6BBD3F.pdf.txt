BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer is curable in the majority of men, and persisting treatment toxicity is a concern. The
authors report a cross-sectional study of the long-term effects of chemotherapy (C) on neurologic function and
development of Raynaud phenomenon. METHODS: Seven hundred thirty-nine patients who were treated between
1982 and 1992 gave consent to enter the study. Patients were classified according to the receipt of C (n ¼ 384) or no
C (n ¼ 355). Patients completed a general health questionnaire and a quality-of-life form (the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life C30 questionnaire with testicular module). Symptom scores of
3 or 4 were considered clinically significant. Patients were assessed in the clinic, and clinical history was used to diagnose Raynaud phenomenon (RP) and tinnitus. Examinations included peripheral nerve function testing for light touch
and vibration sense. Five hundred seventy-seven patients underwent audiometry. RESULTS: On physician assessment,
peripheral neuropathy and RP were more common after C (21.7% vs 9.1% [P<.001] and 20.3% vs 1.7% [P<.001],
respectively). Similar results were obtained for symptom scores (12.5% vs 5.5% [P ¼ .002] and 9.7% vs 3.7% [P<.001],
respectively). On multivariate analysis, for peripheral neuropathy, the significant predictors were cisplatin dose, carboplatin dose, and age. For RP, the significant predictor was bleomycin. Significant differences in hearing thresholds
were noted at 8000 hertz only and, on multivariate analysis, were related to age, cisplatin dose, and vincristine dose.
Auditory symptom scores did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: With long-term follow-up, peripheral neuropathy and RP remained detectable in approximately 20% of patients and caused significant symptoms in 10% of
patients. Detectable effects on high frequency remained but caused little symptomatic problem. These effects perC 2010 American Cancer
sisted and were related to the cumulative chemotherapy dose. Cancer 2010;116:2322–31. V

KEYWORDS: testicular cancer, late treatment toxicity, chemotherapy, quality of life, cisplatin, carboplatin, bleomycin,

With the development of multiagent, cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, the majority of patients with testicular cancer are cured. Because this is a malignancy that typically affects young men in their 20s and 30s, the potential for long-term
toxicity after treatment is of particular concern. Late treatment-related morbidity because of peripheral neuropathy (PN),
hearing impairment, and Raynaud phenomenon (RP) arising from persisting neurologic and small vessel damage has been
well recognized to occur in an estimated 20% to 40% of patients who receive chemotherapy.1 However, published data are
derived predominantly from patients who received combined cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB), and few longterm data are available for current regimens, which rarely incorporate vinblastine. Therefore, replacement of vinca alkaloids
with etoposide in modern regimens (such as combined bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP]) might be expected to
reduce the prevalence of such late toxicity. We investigated the long-term neurologic and small vessel morbidity in survivors
as part of a wide-ranging, cross-sectional study of patients who were treated at our institution between 1982 and 1992.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study methodology has been reported previously.2 In
brief, 1200 patients who were residents of the United
Kingdom, were registered with a diagnosis of germ cell tumor at the Royal Marsden Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust between 1982 and 1992, and
completed treatment at least 5 years previously were eligible for entry. Of these, 739 patients with testicular cancer
were recruited and provided their written consent to enter
the study. An additional 402 patients were lost to followup or were not seen during the study time frame, and 59
patients declined to enter the study. Patients initially were
classified into 4 groups according to treatment received after orchidectomy: surveillance (S), radiotherapy (RT),
chemotherapy (C), and both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (C-RT). The toxicities under current investigation related primarily to chemotherapy; therefore, the S
and RT-only groups were combined to act as a reference
population to the C and C-RT groups.
Patients completed a general health questionnaire
and a quality-of-life form (the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 with testicular module). Symptom scores
for RP, PN, difficulty hearing, and tinnitus were taken
from the testicular module, and scores of 3 or 4 were
regarded as significant. Patients underwent clinical assessment. To ensure clinical relevance, provocative tests for
RP were not used: RP was diagnosed on the basis of the
description of clear, cold-related, peripheral discomfort
and skin color change, and patients also were asked about
the presence of tinnitus. Neurologic examination was performed and included a peripheral nerve function test for
light touch and vibration sense using a 128-megahertz
tuning fork. Five hundred seventy-seven patients underwent audiometry with hearing thresholds in each ear
measured at 1000 hertz (Hz), 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and
8000 Hz. The mean thresholds between the 2 ears at each
level were calculated, and hearing was regarded as abnormal if the mean threshold was above the World Health
Organization-defined upper normal limit of 25 decibels
(dB).
Information on received chemotherapy was
extracted from hospital notes and pharmacy records. If
patients received more than 1 regime, then the cumulative
doses of cisplatin (mg/m2), carboplatin (area under the
concentration time curve [AUC]), bleomycin (1000 IU),
vincristine (mg), and vinblastine (mg/kg) were estimated
by adding the dose prescribed per cycle for all schedules
received by each individual. Unless documented other-

wise, we assumed that no dose reductions were made and
that the prescribed dose was in accordance with accepted
protocols. To facilitate the assessment of interactions
between agents, patients who received chemotherapy also
were subgrouped according to the receipt of combinations
that contained cisplatin, cisplatin plus vincristine, cisplatin plus vinblastine, cisplatin and both vinca alkaloids, or
none of the above.
Statistical Methods
Information collected at the clinic visit, questionnaire information, treatment information (including cumulative
drug doses), and audiometry results were entered onto the
Bob Champion Unit research database. Comparisons
were made between the chemotherapy and no-chemotherapy treatment groups. Categorical data were examined
using the chi-square test, and nonparametric continuous
variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test
and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Predictors of dichotomous
variables were analyzed using stepwise logistic regression
analysis, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) are presented. Substitution for missing
results was not performed. The threshold for statistical
significance was P ¼ .05, and all P values are 2-sided and
are uncorrected for multiple testing. The study was undertaken with approval from the local research ethics committee (Ethics Committee no. 1387).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Informed consent was provided by 739 patients. Details
of demographic and clinical characteristics are provided in
Table 1. The NC group (n ¼ 355) had received either
postorchidectomy surveillance (n ¼ 181) or RT (n ¼
174). The chemotherapy-treated population (n ¼ 384)
comprised 293 patients who received chemotherapy only
and 91 patients who received a combination of both
chemotherapy and RT. There were no differences in
smoking history, the presence of hypertension, or low serum magnesium levels between groups. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was present in only 4 patients at the time
of the study visit, although glucose screening was not performed as part of the study protocol. Those who received
chemotherapy were significantly younger at the first treatment and the time of study assessment by approximately
3 years. It was at least 3 years since the last treatment for
all patients, and only 11 patients had follow-up of <5
years.

Chemotherapy was cisplatin-based in 66% of both
the C group and the C-RT group (Table 2). Carboplatin
also was received by 52 of the cisplatin-treated patients,
predominantly in the context of a cisplatin-based salvage
regimen after initial carboplatin-based treatment or
through the use of both platinum agents as initial treatment. All patients who received either vinca alkaloid were
coprescribed cisplatin. The receipt of either vincristine or
vinblastine was more prevalent in the C-RT group. Of the
333 patients who received bleomycin, it was combined
with carboplatin (J) and etoposide (JEB) in 79 patients
and with a cisplatin-based regimen in the remaining
patients. It was possible to calculate the received doses of
cisplatin, carboplatin, vinblastine, vincristine, and bleomycin in 379 of 384 patients who received chemotherapy
(Table 3). Chemotherapy records were insufficient to
determine the regimens received in 2 patients and were
insufficient to calculate cumulative doses of the drugs
received in another 3 patients. Twenty-one patients who
received chemotherapy developed recurrent disease after
completing the initial treatment regimen, including 15
patients in the C-RT group. The regimen at the time of
disease recurrence was bleomycin, vincristine, and cisplatin (BOP) either alone (n ¼ 4 patients), or in combination
with BEP (BOPBEP; n ¼ 10 patients) or cisplatin plus
BOPBEP (CBOPBEP; n ¼ 2 patients), or followed by an
ifosphamide regimen (n ¼ 2 patients). One patient
received combination chemotherapy followed by high-

2324

dose carboplatin plus etoposide at the time of disease
recurrence.
Peripheral Neuropathy
An objective assessment of PN was performed in 730
patients, and 679 patients participated in a subjective
quality-of-life assessment: Those results are presented in
Table 4. Both means of assessment demonstrated an
excess of PN among those who received chemotherapy
(objective assessment: 21.7% vs 9.1%; P<.001; subjective
assessment: 12.5% vs 5.5%; P ¼ .002). In patients with
PN, the prescribed dose of all chemotherapy agents was
significantly higher than in patients without PN. Cisplatin dose increments of 200 mg/m2 (OR, 1.91; 95% CI,
1.61-2.26; P<.001) carboplatin dose increments of an
AUC of 10 (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.043-1.529) and age at
the time of the study (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.08;
P<.001) were the only significant predictors of persisting
neuropathy in regression analysis (Table 5). The prevalence of PN on clinical examination increased with cisplatin dose; and, after patients received doses >201 mg/m2,
the proportion of patients with high symptom scores and
objective evidence of PN more than doubled compared
with the proportion of patients who received lower cisplatin doses or alternative treatment strategies. At lower doses
of cisplatin, equivalent to those received with 2 cycles of
adjuvant treatment, toxicity appeared to differ little from
that among the reference no-chemotherapy population

regimens was comparable that after patients received a cisplatin-bleomycin and exceeded the levels observed after
nonbleomycin regimens (22.4%, 25.3%, and 2.1%,

2326

respectively). Although few patients received very high
doses of bleomycin (>540,000 IU), the prevalence of RP
increased with the cumulative bleomycin dose when
assessed by both diagnostic history and severe symptom
scores and appeared to plateau at doses >180,000 IU,
equivalent to the dose received after 3 cycles of BEP
(Table 8).
Hearing
Audiometry was performed in 577 patients. When
the C group was compared with the NC group, a
statistically significant difference was observed at
8000 Hz only, with median average thresholds of 25
dB and 30 dB, respectively (P<.01) (Table 9). Those
who had audiometry did not differ from the remainder of the assessed cohort in all factors other than in
marginally longer follow-up (10.8 years vs 9.72 years
in those who did not have audiometry (P ¼ .001),
which seems unlikely to account for the observed difference. A trend toward a difference in hearing difficulty symptom scores, but not in tinnitus, was
observed between the 2 groups (Table 4).
Regression analysis identified age, cisplatin dose,
and vincristine dose as significant predictors of having a reduced hearing threshold at 8000 Hz (Table
10). Subdivision of the C group according to the cumulative cisplatin dose revealed an increasing number
of patients with abnormal thresholds (>25 dB)
among those who received higher cumulative cisplatin
or vincristine doses (Tables 11 and 12). At this frequency, average thresholds increased significantly with
cisplatin dose (P<.001) (Fig. 1). The reporting of

DISCUSSION
With long-term data from 384 patients who received
chemotherapy, to our knowledge, this is the largest study
to assess the prevalence of these late toxicities to date,
and the duration of follow-up indicates that these effects
are persistent. Previous assessments have not included
patients who received noncisplatin-containing regimens,
and long-term data predominantly followed treatment
with PVB, which rarely would be used in current protocols and accounted for only 8% of the patients who
received chemotherapy in the current study. Comparison of chemotherapy-treated patients with a reference
surveillance and RT-treated population provides some
reassurance that the outcomes observed relate to chemotherapy rather than to other patient or tumor-related
factors.
RP, diagnosed from a history of characteristic skin
color changes and discomfort in response to the cold, is a
well recognized complication after chemotherapy treatment for germ cell tumors. Vinblastine and bleomycin
have been identified the most consistently as risk factors
for RP, and long-term data are derived predominantly
from series of men who received PVB in which 35% to
45% of patients had persisting RP after 3 or 4 cycles.3-8
The proposed mechanisms for this include direct vascular
toxicity with evidence of endothelial dysfunction that persists after chemotherapy,9 although abnormal sympathetic
arterial vasoconstrictor response because of neurotoxicity
also has been suggested.5,8 Substituting etoposide for vinblastine to avoid synergism with bleomycin may reduce
the risk and is supported by data from a small series with
longer follow-up.3 Although, in the current study, only a
small proportion of patients received vinblastine, we
observed clear evidence of excess RP at a mean follow-up

of 10 years in those who received any chemotherapy
(20.3% vs 1.7%; P<.01). The prevalence of severe subjective toxicity was lower, but the differences were significant. In primary RP, it is recognized that only 12% of
those affected report severe attacks10; therefore, the lower
levels of grade 3 or 4 toxicity we observed, compared with
the objective assessment, do not seem surprising and are
consistent with previous data in this group of patients.
On regression analysis, the bleomycin dose was the
only independent predictor of RP. Moreover, the comparable levels of RP after both carboplatin-based and cisplatin-based regimens support the finding that this is the
critical risk factor. In the current study, objective evidence
of RP was observed in 25% of patients at 10 years after cumulative bleomycin doses >180,000 IU. This is in accordance with prospectively collected quality-of-life data
after 3 to 4 cycles of BEP indicating that clinically significant RP peaked at 6 months before reducing to 24% at 2
years.7 Our data suggest that this effect persists with longer follow-up. However, we observed that, at lower cumulative doses, equivalent to those received after 2 cycles of
adjuvant BEP, the subjective experience of RP differed little from that in the reference population despite objective
evidence in 13% of patients. An association with smoking
history or hypertension was not supported by our data.
The use of infusional bleomycin may reduce the risk of
RP3; however, limitations of our chemotherapy records
means that we were unable to comment on this within
this study.

Cisplatin-related ototoxicity, which is believed to be
a direct consequence of damage to the outer hair cells in
the organ of Corti, results in high-frequency hearing loss
and tinnitus.1 Although the prevalence of ototoxicity
varies according to diagnostic criteria used, symptoms of
tinnitus and hearing impairment reportedly persist in
>20% of patients who receive platinum-based chemotherapy, and high-frequency loss on objective testing is
observed more frequently in these individuals.7,11-13 For
the whole group, objective hearing differences were significant at 8000 Hz only, and a trend toward persisting
severe symptomatic detriment was observed. The importance of the cumulative cisplatin dose as a predictor for
neurotoxicity is supported by our data in which both an
abnormal threshold at 8000 Hz and grade 3 or 4 tinnitus
were related to the dose received. Differences in grade 3 or
4 hearing loss did not reach significance, potentially
reflecting the lower ranges required for hearing speech at
which no audiometric losses were observed. Previous data
suggest that persisting symptoms are experienced by 25%
and 60% of patients who receive cumulative cisplatin
doses >400 mg/m2 and >600 mg/m2, respectively.13
Our symptom data indicate that the experience of severe
auditory toxicity, in fact, is lower and that approximately
10% of patients report grade 3 or 4 symptoms at cumulative doses <800 mg/m2. The sharp rise after doses >800
mg/m2 should be interpreted cautiously, because very few
patients received these cumulative doses. Like in other series, we confirmed that audiometric abnormalities at high
frequencies are present more frequently than severe symptoms. However, the relevance of this for many patients is

questionable given the small impact on quality of life that
we observed. All hearing outcomes for those who received
carboplatin-based regimens were comparable to the outcomes for those who did not receive chemotherapy.
Regression analysis identified vincristine dose and
age at the time of the study, in addition to cisplatin dose,
as significant predictors for having an average hearing
threshold >25 dB at 8000 Hz. Presbyacusis may produce
similar audiometric abnormalities; however, we note that
the mean age at follow-up was in the middle 40s, and no
patients in the C group were even marginally older; thus,
it is unlikely that differences in age alone accounted for
our findings. Data from the 83 chemotherapy-treated
patients previously identified vincristine as factor that
potentiates cisplatin ototoxicity.13 Although patients who
received vincristine in our study were few and generally
also had received higher cumulative cisplatin doses, our
data confirm this association with both agents.
Both the vinca alkaloids and cisplatin may cause paresthesias and disturbances of joint position and vibration
sense in those who are treated.1 Although it is recognized,
neuropathy usually is regarded as an infrequent long-term
sequelae of carboplatin.14,15 It is believed that cisplatin
accumulation within the dorsal root ganglia, causing
direct nerve damage, is the main mechanism of toxicity,
although laboratory evidence suggests that cisplatininduced endothelial cell apoptosis causing microvascular
disruption and ischemia may be important.16 In those
who receive both drugs, the symptoms of PN reportedly
persist in 25% to 70% of patients4,17; and, after 3 to 4
cycles of BEP, 22% of survivors report significant

symptoms at 2 years.7 Our data indicated that the effects
persist with clinical evidence of a neurologic deficit in
21.7% of patients who received chemotherapy compared
with 9.1% in the no-chemotherapy group. The prevalence
of both persisting, objective evidence of PN and significant symptom detriment increased significantly with cisplatin dose, affecting 30% of patients and 15% to 18% of
patients, respectively, at doses >400 mg/m2 at 10 years;
however, approximately 50% of this occurred at lower cumulative doses. We also identified carboplatin as a significant predictor of persisting PN on regression analysis;
however, we are unable to comment on any clear risk
threshold. PN would be expected to be more prevalent in
an older population; therefore, it is not surprising that age
also was a significant variable in regression analysis. Only
4 patients had a diagnosis of comorbid diabetes at the

2330

time of their study visit and, thus, could not be included
meaningfully in our analysis. The presence of significant
numbers of patients with occult diabetes would be
unlikely given the age range of the study population; however, it is a limitation of our study that screening for this
potential confounder was not included in the study
design.
It has not been reported that single-dose intensity
influences the experience of PN after chemotherapy for
patients with germ cell tumors; however, randomized data
from other tumor sites suggests that both total-dose intensity and single-dose intensity may be predictive.18 Cisplatin scheduling also may influence ototoxicity, and
prospective quality-of-life data suggest that 3-day regimens may cause more symptomatic ototoxicity than
5-day BEP.7 A shortcoming of the current study is our

inability to confirm the potential impact of different
scheduling strategies on persisting neurotoxicity. A further limitation is the absence of pretreatment information, in particular regarding symptom status and
audiology. Confounding factors, such as preexisting
symptoms, may have influenced decisions on therapeutic
strategy, in particular curtailing the use of cisplatin in
selected patients. Potentially, this may have diluted the
true prevalence of late chemotherapy toxicity compared
with the reference population.
In conclusion, bleomycin is the key predictor of RP
and persists in 25% of patients who receive cumulative
doses equivalent to 3 cycles of BEP, although significant
toxicity is experienced less frequently. Overall, detectable
effects of chemotherapy on high-frequency hearing
thresholds are present and are predicted by the receipt of
cisplatin and vincristine but appear to cause little impact
on symptom scores compared with a no-chemotherapy
population. Like with ototoxicity, the cumulative cisplatin dose is an important predictor of neuropathy, with evidence on examination in 30% of patients and a significant
quality-of-life detriment in 18% of patients after cumulative doses 400 mg/m2. These cisplatin and bleomycin
effects persist with long-term follow-up.
