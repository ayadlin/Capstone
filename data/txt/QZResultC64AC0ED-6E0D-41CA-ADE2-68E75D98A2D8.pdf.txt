Abstract
The nearly universal recurrence of glioblastoma (GBM) is
driven in part by a treatment-resistant subpopulation of GBM
stem cells (GSC). To identify improved therapeutic possibilities, we combined the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib with a
novel small molecule, CBL0137, which inhibits FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), a histone chaperone complex
predominantly expressed in undifferentiated cells. Lapatinib
and CBL0137 synergistically inhibited the proliferation of
patient-derived GBM cells. Compared with non–stem tumor
cells (NSTC) enriched from the same specimens, the GSCs were
extremely sensitive to CBL0137 monotherapy or FACT knockdown. FACT expression was elevated in GSCs compared with
matched NSTCs and decreased in GSCs upon differentiation.
Acute exposure of GSCs to CBL0137 increased asymmetric cell

division, decreased GSC marker expression, and decreased the
capacity of GSCs to form tumor spheres in vitro and to initiate
tumors in vivo. Oral administration of CBL0137 to mice bearing orthotopic GBM prolonged their survival. Knockdown of
FACT reduced the expression of genes encoding several core
stem cell transcription factors (SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and
OLIG2), and FACT occupied the promoters of these genes.
FACT expression was elevated in GBM tumors compared with
non-neoplastic brain tissues, portended a worse prognosis, and
positively correlated with GSC markers and stem cell gene
expression signatures. Preferential targeting of GSCs by
CBL0137 and synergy with EGFR inhibitors support the development of clinical trials combining these two agents in GBM.

Introduction

Therefore, there is an urgent need for new, effective therapies. In
the majority of GBMs, aberrant ampliﬁcation, an in frame deletion (e.g., EGFRvIII), or mutation of the EGFR has been identiﬁed
(3, 4). The high frequency of EGFR aberrations has generated
considerable interest in using EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI), which have provided signiﬁcantly increased progressionfree survival in other cancers, such as non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC; ref. 5). Nevertheless, the promising results in preclinical
studies have failed to translate into improved outcomes in the
clinic (6–10). One of the proposed mechanisms of resistance to
EGFR TKIs is the compensatory upregulation of related ERBB
family members in GBM cells with stem-like properties (11).
Numerous studies provided evidence of a hierarchal organization within GBMs, commonly termed the cancer stem cell (CSC)
hypothesis. CSCs are less susceptible to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and are more capable of initiating secondary tumor
formation in transplantation assays when compared with non–
stem tumor cells (NSTC) from the same tumors (12–14). Similarly to normal stem cell populations, CSCs self-renew, differentiate, and express many of the same core transcription factors
(14). For GBM, several cell-surface markers, including CD133,
CD44, CD15, EGFR, L1CAM, and integrin a6, are used to enrich
for stem cell populations, known as GBM stem cells (GSC; refs.14,
15). The contribution of GSCs to tumor recurrence following
therapeutic intervention necessitates new strategies to target and
eradicate this cell population in GBM.

Despite the use of aggressive, multimodal treatments for glioblastoma (GBM), the median time to tumor recurrence is 6.9
months, and the median patient survival is 14 months (1, 2).

Targeting GBM Stem Cells through FACT by CBL0137

FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) is a histone chaperone that aids transcriptional elongation by the disassembly
and reassembly of nucleosomes, thereby allowing the passage
of RNA polymerase II through chromatin during transcription
(16). Recently, FACT was found to play a role in maintaining
cells in an undifferentiated state by being part of a stem cell–
like gene expression signature (17). FACT is also highly
expressed in high-grade, poorly differentiated cancers and portends worse survival in these tumors (18). Targeting FACT with
a novel class of small-molecule inhibitors, termed curaxins (19,
20), has been tested in a number of cancers, including NSCLC
(21), pancreatic cancer (22), breast cancer (23), and neuroblastoma (24). Curaxins comprise a novel class of carbazolebased anticancer compounds, discovered as functional analogues of quinacrine, a 9-aminoacridine derivative used originally as an antimalarial drug (19). More recently, both quinacrine
and curaxins were found to harbor antitumor activity by
targeting FACT, which subsequently leads to inhibition of
NF-kB–dependent transcription (19, 20). We have previously
shown that quinacrine treatment can overcome resistance to
the EGFR TKI erlotinib in NSCLC by targeting FACT and
inhibiting NF-kB (21). We now investigate the use of CBL0137,
a curaxin currently undergoing multicenter phase I clinical
trials in metastatic or unresectable advanced solid neoplasms
or refractory lymphomas (NCT01905228), in GBM. We treated
patient-derived GBM specimens, maintained as xenografts,
with the combination of CBL0137 and lapatinib. In particular,
we tested the impact of CBL0137 on GSCs, deﬁned as CD133positive (CD133þ) cells, in comparison with NSTCs, or CD133negative (CD133) cells, and the potential role of FACT in
maintaining the stem cell phenotype of GSCs.

tech). All cells were cultured at 37 C at 5% CO2 and utilized in
under ﬁve passages. CD133þ were cultured in Neurobasal media
(Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), basic FGF
(10 ng/mL; R&D Systems), EGF (10 ng/mL; R&D Systems),
L-glutamine (2 mmol/L; Invitrogen), and sodium pyruvate
(1 mmol/L; Invitrogen). CD133 cells were cultured in DMEM
with 10% FBS. CD133þ and CD133 cells in cell proliferation
assays (IncuCyte) were maintained in growth factor–free Neurobasal medium (supplemented with the above components except
for growth factors). Unsorted bulk tumor cells were cultured in
supplemented Neurobasal media mixed with DMEM with 10%
FBS at a 1:1 ratio.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay (Promega). The combination index (CI) was assessed
by CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc.; ref. 27). For apoptosis,
at 48 hours, caspase 3/7 activity was measured by CaspaseGlo 3/7
Assay (Promega). Alternatively, cell conﬂuence was monitored
every hour for up to 4 days using the IncuCyte ZOOM live cell
imaging system (Essen BioScience), which enables noninvasive,
continuous, and direct evaluation of cell numbers and growth
using live cell time-lapse microscopy.
Flow cytometric analysis and sorting
Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS Aria II Cell Sorter
(BD Biosciences). To enrich for CD133þ cells, single cells were
labeled with a phycoerythin-conjugated monoclonal antibody
against CD133 (CD133/1, AC133; Miltenyi Biotec). Dead cells
were eliminated by DAPI staining (1 mg/mL, added immediately
prior to sorting).

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Lapatinib was obtained from Selleck Chemicals (# S2111).
CBL0137 was provided by Incuron, LLC. For immunoblotting,
mouse b-actin antibody (# A5316) was from Sigma; rabbit GFAP
antibody (# Z0334) was from Dako; rabbit histone H3 (#4499)
was from Cell Signaling Technology; mouse OLIG2 (# ab56643)
antibody was from Abcam; rabbit SOX2 antibody (# A301-741)
was from Bethyl Laboratories; and mouse SSRP1 antibody
(# 609701) was from BioLegend. For immunoﬂuorescence
assays, mouse CD133/1 (#W6B3C1) antibody was from Miltenyi Biotec.
Isolation and culture of CD133-positive GSCs
Primary patient-derived brain tumor patient specimens were
obtained in compliance with Institutional Review Board–
approved protocol. Known tumor grade and available cytogenetic
information (relevant to pathologic classiﬁcation) for each specimen have been previously published (13, 25, 26). Cells were
authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis by the Duke
University DNA Analysis Facility. EGFR ampliﬁcation status (%
cells positive for polysomy) is as follows: 3691 (83%), 08-387
(WT), 3565 (unknown), 4121 (WT, 48% of cells have loss of EGFR
locus), CW718 (unknown), and 4302 (62%). The specimens were
maintained as subcutaneous xenografts in the ﬂanks of NOD scid
gamma (NSG) mice. Tumors cells were dissociated using a papain
dissociation system (Worthington Biochemical). CD133þ cells
were enriched by magnetic-activated cell sorting (Miltenyi Bio-

Limiting dilution assay and sphere formation
GSCs were plated using FACS sorting into 96-well plates at 1, 5,
10, 20, or 50 cells/well in supplemented Neurobasal medium.
After 14 days, wells were scored for the presence of at least one
tumor sphere. Estimated stem cell frequency was calculated using
extreme limiting dilution analysis (28).
Mitotic cell collection and analysis
GSCs were treated with vehicle, 300 nmol/L CBL0137, or 3
mmol/L lapatinib for 9 hours. Collection of mitotic pairs and
quantiﬁcation of asymmetry were performed as previously
described (29) and detailed in Supplementary Materials.
Lentiviral transduction
Lentiviral plasmids encode shRNAs targeting GFP, SSRP1
(TRCN0000019270, "#1"; TRCN0000019272, "#2"), or SUPT16H
(SPT16) (TRCN0000001258250, "#2", TRCN00000001260250,
"#4").
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and
reversed transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript Reverse
Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). Real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler 480 Instrument II using the SYBR
Green Master Mix (Roche). Gene-speciﬁc primers are described in
Supplementary Materials.

Foundation Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and
conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals. For intracranial implantation studies, 10
 103 viable GSCs were implanted into the left striate nucleus of 4to 6-month-old NSG mice. Mice were monitored daily for neurological impairment, at which time they were sacriﬁced. For in
vivo treatment, 7 days after intracranial implantation of GSCs,
DMSO or CBL0137 (0.5 mg/mL) was added to drinking water and
replaced every 7 days.
Bioinformatics and statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using Graphpad Prism 5
unless otherwise stated. Results are represented by mean  SD.

Results
GBM cells are resistant to lapatinib but sensitive to CBL0137
alone and CBL0137 plus lapatinib
Previously, we reported that the combination of erlotinib
with quinacrine, a curaxin predecessor, is synergistic in NSCLC
(21). CBL0137 is a second-generation FACT inhibitor and more
potent than quinacrine (20). Importantly, in orthotopic xenograft models of GBM, CBL0137 achieves effective CNS penetration, as evidenced by its high concentration in normal brain
tissues in mice (383 mmol/L at 0.5 hours after i.v. injection of
70 mg/kg CBL0137) and steadily decreases with time to 9
mmol/L at 24 hours, which is still 30 times above its in vitro
IC50 of 300 nmol/L against GBM cells (Supplementary Fig. S1);
further, its concentration in tumors was elevated in comparison
with normal brain tissues (36). In these models, CBL0137 has
also been shown to signiﬁcantly prolong the survival of tumorbearing mice (37).
We performed a longitudinal drug treatment experiment with
lapatinib alone, CBL0137 alone, or both in unsorted cells from
several patient-derived GBM tumor specimens and a non-neoplastic brain specimen (Fig. 1). There was little or no effect of
lapatinib in inhibiting tumor cell growth. Importantly, treatment
with CBL0137 alone or in combination with lapatinib was highly
effective in inhibiting cell proliferation in all three tumor
specimens.

added. Cell conﬂuence was monitored
by the IncuCyte ZOOM System every
hour thereafter and normalized to
vehicle-treated wells.

Prolonged exposure to CBL0137 preferentially kills GSCs over
NSTCs and synergizes with lapatinib
We sorted GBM patient tumor specimens into GSCs and NSTCs
based on CD133 (13, 25, 26) and then tested for differences in
sensitivity to CBL0137 between GSCs and NSTCs. Sorting purity
was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting for the independent stem cell
marker OLIG2 (14), present only in the CD133þ cells, or glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes and
more differentiated cells (15), expressed only in the CD133
cells (Fig. 2A).
In all three patient-derived tumor specimens, both GSCs and
NSTCs were highly sensitive to CBL0137, with IC50s ranging
between 100 and 600 nmol/L (Fig. 2B); whereas IC50s for lapatinib were between 1 and 6 mmol/L, approximately 10-fold higher
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). EGFR expression and ampliﬁcation
status in the CD133þ and CD133 population are indicated in the
Method section and Supplementary Fig. S2B, respectively.
To evaluate synergy between lapatinib and CBL0137, we combined them at a molar ratio of 10 to 1, based on their IC50s, and
repeated the dose-response experiments. GSCs were more sensitive to the combination compared with NSTCs; in fact, the
combination was able to reduce the IC50 of CBL0137 for GSCs
to values below 100 nmol/L (Fig. 2B). The degrees of synergism

www.aacrjournals.org

were quantiﬁed using Chou and Talalay's median-drug effect
analysis method (27). The combination of lapatinib and
CBL0137 was synergistic in all three patient-derived tumor specimens, regardless of their CD133 status, when combined at 10:1
ratios, as indicated by CIs below 1.0 (Fig. 2C).
To conﬁrm the above ﬁndings, we treated GSCs or NSTCs
with 300 nmol/L CBL0137, 3 mmol/L lapatinib, or CBL0137
plus lapatinib, and monitored cell conﬂuence over time using
live-cell microscopy (IncuCyte Zoom). CBL0137 or lapatinib
signiﬁcantly decreased cell proliferation of GSCs compared
with that of NSTCs, and combination treatment completely
inhibited cell proliferation in GSCs but not NSTCs (Fig. 2D).
Consistently, signiﬁcantly more apoptosis was detected in
GSCs compared with NSTCs treated with the same doses of
CBL0137 (Fig. 3A).
CBL0137 preferentially kills GSCs over NSTCs by targeting
FACT
Curaxins were shown to induce chromatin trapping of FACT, a
dimer of SSRP1 and SPT16 (20). Consistently, we observed that
CBL0137 depleted FACT from the soluble nucleoplasmic fraction
and led to its accumulation in the insoluble chromatin fraction
(Fig. 3B), which indicates FACT inhibition (20, 22). Importantly,

were transduced with lentiviral
vectors bearing puromycin resistance

efﬁciency was evaluated by
immunoblotting of SSRP1. F, following
puromycin selection, equal numbers
of GSCs and NSTCs transduced with
shRNAs against SSRP1 or shGFP were
plated and assayed for cell viability
normalized to the values for shGFP.

we observed signiﬁcantly higher protein levels of the FACT subunits in GSCs compared with NSTCs in untreated cells, which was
validated in three independent specimens (Fig. 3C). This was
supported by higher SSRP1 mRNA expression in independent
specimens from a transcriptome proﬁling of CD133þ versus
CD133 GBM cells (Fig. 3D; ref. 38).
To test whether the increased sensitivity to CBL0137 might
be due to a higher expression and reliance on FACT in GSCs
than in NSTCs, we transduced them with two different shRNAs
to SSRP1 or scrambled shRNA and assayed cell viability. Consistent with our hypothesis, depletion of SSRP1 signiﬁcantly
decreased cell viability in the GSCs compared with the NSTCs
(Fig. 3E and F).
Acute exposure to CBL0137 attenuates GSCs self-renewal and
tumor initiation
A hallmark of tumor-initiating cells is their ability to form a
tumorsphere from a single cell in vitro (14). We assessed whether
CBL0137 affects the ability of GSCs to form tumorspheres in an in
vitro extreme limiting dilution assay, which permits quantiﬁed
estimation of stem-like cell frequencies (28). We exposed GSCs to
vehicle, 300 nmol/L, or 600 nmol/L of CBL0137 for 24 hours.
Cells were then washed and plated at densities of 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50
cells per well. CBL0137 markedly decreased self-renewal of the
GSCs based on evaluation of tumorsphere formation 14 days later
(Fig. 4A).

2436 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

To examine whether CBL0137 treatment has an impact on
tumor initiation and survival of tumor-bearing animals in vivo, we
pretreated GSCs with vehicle or CBL0137 and intracranially
implanted viable cells into immunocompromised mice. Exposure
of GSCs to low-dose CBL0137 (300 nmol/L) for 24 hours ex vivo
prior to xenografting was sufﬁcient to increase latency in tumor
initiation and prolonged survival (Fig. 4B). Of note, whenever we
examined the impact of CBL0137 on stem cell phenotypes, we
chose a time-point of 24 hours or less for treatment with 300
nmol/L CBL0137 based on our analysis of cell viability in
CD133þ cells, which showed no immediate or delayed cell death
compared with vehicle (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating the
decrease in overall stemness was not due to a decrease in viability.
To evaluate in vivo efﬁcacy, mice with intracranially implanted
GSCs were given DMSO or CBL0137 in their drinking water (at
libitum, 0.5 mg/mL). Treatment with CBL0137 signiﬁcantly prolonged survival (Fig. 4C).
Acute exposure to CBL0137 decreases CD133 cell-surface
expression and increases asymmetric cell division in GSCs
To further explore the impact of CBL0137 on GSC phenotypes,
we treated GSCs with 300 nmol/L CBL0137 and analyzed the
expression of CD133 in the viable population. We observed a
decline in CD133 levels with drug treatment compared with
vehicle (Fig. 5A). Recently, GSCs have been shown to undergo
predominantly symmetric rather than asymmetric cell division at

the single-cell level (29). Asymmetric cell division is an important
mechanism by which normal stem cells maintain a constant stem
cell population and also generate differentiated progeny, whereas
symmetric cell division has been proposed to occur at a higher
frequency in tumors to amplify the fraction of CSCs (39). We
hypothesized that a switch from symmetric to asymmetric cell
division could account for the decrease in CD133þ cells. To this
end, we exposed GSCs to vehicle or CBL0137 (300 nmol/L) for 9
hours, collected mitotic cells, and then measured the frequencies

of symmetric and asymmetric cell division by quantifying the

dividing daughter cells (% deviation). Similarly to previous
reports (29), asymmetric cell division was a rare event in the
GSCs we examined (6% in the vehicle control). CBL0137 treatment signiﬁcantly increased the frequency of asymmetric cell
division in GSCs to 18% (Fig. 5B–D). As a positive control, we
observed a similar but less signiﬁcant effect when we exposed the
cells to 10% FBS, an agent commonly used to differentiate GSCs

GSCs. A, GSCs in suspension were
treated with DMSO or 300 nmol/L
CBL0137 for 24 or 48 hours, and then
stained with DAPI, isotype control, or
an anti–CD133-PE antibody. CD133
expression was subsequently
analyzed by FACS within the DAPInegative populations. B, following
release from 15 hours of thymidine

(Supplementary Fig. S4). Our ﬁnding suggests that CBL0137 can
shift the balance from symmetric cell division to asymmetric cell
division, implying increased differentiation, leading to a decrease
in the frequency of CD133þ cells among the GSCs.
FACT is involved in the expression of regulatory stem cell
transcription factors
We measured the expression of the stem cell markers SOX2,
OCT4, NANOG, and OLIG2 following suppression of FACT
expression in GSCs (12–15). Knockdown of SSRP1 signiﬁcantly
reduced the levels of these mRNAs (Fig. 6A). This was corroborated when we overexpressed the essential dimerization domain
of SSRP1 (SSRP1 DD), a dominant-negative derivative of FACT
that prevents the dimerization of endogenous SSRP1 and SPT16
(40), and observed a reduction in the expression of SOX2, OCT4,
NANOG, OLIG2, and NES (Fig. 6B). Further, using chromatin
immunoprecipitation, we found that FACT binds to the promoters of the SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG genes (Fig. 6C) in GSCs,
further implicating its potential role in regulating the expression
of these genes. Consistently, using SOX2 as a surrogate stemness
marker, we detected a dose-dependent reduction of SOX2 protein
levels in GSCs treated with CBL0137 (Fig. 6D).

2438 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

To explore whether FACT expression correlates with the differentiation status of GSCs, we treated them with 10% FBS to induce
differentiation. In response to serum, OLIG2 decreased rapidly
while GFAP increased (Fig. 6E). Importantly, SSRP1 expression
also decreased with differentiation.
FACT is elevated in GBMs compared with normal brain tissues,
and its level correlates with survival and GSC gene signatures
Gill and colleagues (41) recently performed an RNA-seq analysis of GBM samples from radiographically guided biopsies (n ¼
39) versus non-neoplastic brain (n ¼ 17; GSE9612). Comparing
SSRP1 and SPT16 gene expression between these two groups, we
found a markedly elevated FACT expression in GBM compared
with non-neoplastic brain tissues (Fig. 7A). Moreover, analysis of
GBM patient survival data from NIH's Repository for Molecular
Brain Neoplastic Data (REMBRANDT; ref. 42) showed that upregulation of SSRP1 expression (>80th percentile, n ¼ 36), compared with low expression (n ¼ 133), is signiﬁcantly associated
with worse survival (Fig. 7B). In addition, SSRP1 and SPT16
expression is positively correlated with well-established cancer
stem cell markers: SOX2, OCT4, and NESTIN in the contrastenhanced gliomas (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, there is no positive

Targeting GBM Stem Cells through FACT by CBL0137

ref. 31). Data from samples with high SSRP1 (>75 percentile, n
¼ 107) or low SSRP1 expression (<25 percentile, n ¼ 227) were
input into the GSEA tool (30) to analyze for enrichment of gene
sets that are associated with stem cell identities (32–35). A
positive normalized enrichment score reﬂects the degree to which
genes positively correlated with the high SSRP1 phenotype are
overrepresented in the gene sets analyzed, and is normalized to
the size of the gene sets. Genes positively correlated with high
SSRP1 expression were signiﬁcantly enriched in gene signatures
associated with stemness (Fig. 7D, GSE57872). None of the 56
stem cell–related gene sets analyzed were signiﬁcantly enriched in
samples with the low SSRP1 phenotype.
Taken together, our data support the efﬁcacy of CBL0137
against GSCs and strongly suggest the importance of FACT in
maintaining a stem cell phenotype in GBM, offering preclinical
insight into targeting the stem cell–like neoplastic population and
possibly reducing tumor recurrence.

Discussion

Figure 6.
FACT is involved in the expression of regulatory stem cell transcription
factors. A and B, the expression of SSRP1, SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, OLIG2, and
NES mRNA, normalized to 18S rRNA, in GSCs transduced with shGFP or two
different shRNAs against SSRP1 (A), or SSRP1 DD (SSRP1 dimerization
domain) vs. vector control (B), was measured using qPCR. C, ChIP was
performed in GSCs by using an antibody against SSRP1 or mouse IgG and
subsequent qPCR analysis of the promoters of the SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4
genes. D, GSCs were plated onto Geltrex-coated plates and treated with 0,
300, 600, or 1,200 nmol/L CBL0137 for 24 hours. Changes in the levels of
SOX2 were detected by immunoblotting. E, GSCs were plated onto Geltrexprecoated plates and exposed to 10% FBS-containing media for 0, 2, 4,
or 6 days. Changes in the levels of SSRP1, OLIG2, and GFAP over the course of
6 days of serum differentiation were evaluated by immunoblotting.

correlation between the expression of FACT and the GSC markers
in the non-neoplastic brain tissues (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Furthermore, because the existence of GSCs in GBMs reﬂects
intratumoral heterogeneity, we examined RNA-seq data from 430
primary single-cell glioblastoma transcriptomes (GSE57872;

www.aacrjournals.org

To date, no targeted therapy against GBM has been successfully
translated into improved survival. For instance, anti-EGFR therapies, such as erlotinib and lapatinib, have failed to reproduce in
GBM the success seen in the treatment of NSCLC (8–10). The
standard-of-care treatment in GBM, extensive surgical resection
followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy (mostly temozolomide), may allow treatment-resistant GSCs to survive. Hence,
tumor recurrence after initial eradication has been attributed to
GSCs due to their inherent or acquired resistance to therapy, e.g.,
elevated DNA damage repair activity and aberrations in apoptotic
pathways (12–15, 43). To identify a drug combination to overcome resistance to lapatinib, we examined CBL0137, previously
shown to have anticancer activity in multiple tumor types (18–
24). CBL0137 was also shown to accumulate to high levels in
normal brain tissues and even more so in brain tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1 and ref. 36), and to signiﬁcantly increase survival
in orthotopic GBM preclinical models (37).
We discovered a biphasic impact of CBL0137 on GSC: prolonged treatment with CBL0137 preferentially impairs the viability of GSCs over NSTCs by targeting FACT, whereas acute
exposure compromises crucial stem cell phenotypes, including
expression of stem cell markers, capacity for self-renewal, and in
vivo tumor initiation. We also showed higher FACT expression in
GSCs compared with NSTCs, both in our own panel of patient
specimens and in external, independent datasets, and that FACT
expression correlates with stem cell gene signatures in patient
samples. We are aware of the limitations and controversies
surrounding the use of CD133 as a GSC marker. Nevertheless,
for the particular models that we use, we have validated the
functional segregation of tumor sphere formation and in vivo
tumor initiation using CD133 sorting (12, 25, 26). In addition, we
showed that sorting with CD133 was sufﬁcient to segregate the
GBM cells into those predominantly expressing GSC but not
differentiation markers, or vice versa.
Our observation that FACT depletion reduces expression of the
core stem cell transcription factors SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and
OLIG2 points to its possible regulatory role in stem cell transcriptional programming (44). A recent ChIP-seq experiment performed in human ﬁbrosarcoma cells showed an enrichment of
SSRP1 at transcription factor genes, e.g., OCT4, which are involved

Targeting GBM Stem Cells through FACT by CBL0137

in embryonic development or highly expressed in poorly differentiated cancers (18).
Our ﬁnding that exposure to CBL0137 switches GSCs from a
symmetric to an asymmetric mode of cell division and reduces
CD133 expression suggests that CBL0137 reduces the CD133þ
GSC population by promoting a switch toward asymmetric cell
division. Certain oncogenes in cancer stem cells disrupt the tightly
regulated asymmetric mode of cell division in normal stem cells
by promoting symmetric cell division and thereby uncontrolled
expansion of stem cells (39). Therefore, FACT could play a role in
sustaining the generation of the GSC population within the tumor
and thus permitting the progressive development of cancer.
A recent pancreatic cancer study using CD24Hi/CD44Hi as CSC
markers showed that CBL0137 decreased their numbers in vitro
and that SSRP1 was more highly expressed in this population
compared with the CD24Lo/CD44Lo population (22). Our study,
in addition to demonstrating increased FACT expression in
CD133þ GSCs compared with CD133 NSTCs, demonstrate not
only the ability of CBL0137 to kill GSCs, but also how this effect
was more marked compared with that in matched NSTCs. Furthermore, the novelty and signiﬁcance of our study lie in our
ﬁndings that CBL0137 treatment or FACT depletion affects several
deﬁning characteristics of cancer stem cells (14, 15): in vitro selfrenewal capacity, in vivo tumor-initiating capacity, expression of
core stem cell transcription factors, and propensity to undergo
asymmetric cell division, which in turn potentially drives differentiation into NSTCs. In addition, we showed synergy between
CBL0137 and lapatinib, illustrating the potential of combining
FACT-targeting agents and EGFR TKIs to improve treatment
outcome of the latter. We investigated EGFR protein levels
between the CD133þ and CD133 populations (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). It is difﬁcult to make a conclusion regarding drug
synergies based on EGFR immunoblot data alone especially in
light of the dual targeting of lapatinib to HER2 and the reported
elevation of HER2 in GSCs (11). Follow-up studies could include
manipulation of these receptors in both GSCs and NSTCs to better
understand the difference in drug sensitivity between the GSCs
and NSTCs as well as elucidation of the mechanism behind the
synergy. Nonetheless, our studies highlight the novel indication
of CBL0137 for GBM.
Therefore, this is the ﬁrst comprehensive study that not only
holds promising translational potential by showing the novel,
preferential targeting of cancer stem cells by CBL0137, but also
elucidates FACT's role in regulating crucial cancer stem cell–
deﬁning functions by detailed mechanistic investigations.
CBL0137 is currently undergoing multicenter phase I clinical
trials in advanced or metastatic solid tumors and lymphomas
(NCT01905228), and has been shown to signiﬁcantly prolong
survival alone or in combination with temozolomide, the current
standard-of-care treatment in GBM, in orthotopic preclinical

models (37). One promising approach would be to use GSCtargeting therapy prior to or simultaneously with tumor-eradicating radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which effectively kills
NSTCs but to which GSCs are largely resistant (12, 13, 45), to
prevent tumor recurrence by also eradicating GSCs. Another
important avenue to explore is combination treatment with
CBL0137 and single-agent pathway inhibitors, e.g., PDGF, mTOR,
VEGF, which showed promising preclinical efﬁcacy but modest
survival beneﬁts in patients (46). Our novel ﬁnding of preferential
targeting of GSCs through FACT and the ready availability of a
drug that effectively sustains its inhibition presents a highly
translatable and targeted therapeutic approach that can be
exploited clinically in GBM.
