BACKGROUND: Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in
which the upper aerodigestive tract is the most commonly involved site. To date, optimal treatment strategies and prognosis for
patients with ENKTL have not been fully defined. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
safety profiles of first-line combined gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and L-asparaginase (GELOX) followed by involved-field radiation therapy for patients with stage IE/IIE ENKTL. The primary endpoints were the complete response rate, the objective response rate, and
toxicities. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL were enrolled and completed the entire course of treatment. At the end of treatment, the overall response rate was
96.3%, including 20 patients (74.1%) who attained a complete response and 6 patients (22.2%) who attained a partial response. No
patients developed disease progression during therapy. Grade 1 and 2 toxicities were frequent during GELOX, but grade 3 and 4 toxicities were few, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. At a median follow-up of 27.37 months, 7 patients (25.9%) experienced
disease progression, and 4 of those patients died of disease. The rates of 2-year overall and progression-free survival were both 86%,
and patients who attained a complete response at the end of treatment had significantly longer progression-free survival (P ¼ .012)
and overall survival (P ¼ .021) than patients who did not attain a complete response. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated
that GELOX followed by involved-field radiation therapy can be an effective and feasible treatment strategy for patients with stage
IE/IIE ENKTL of the upper aerodigestive tract. These results will require further investigation in larger prospective trials. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) is a distinct subtype of natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma. Although it is uncommon in western countries, it makes up 5% to 10% of all lymphomas in the Chinese population.1 ENKTL can present with either nasal or extranasal involvement, and the upper aerodigestive tract is the most
frequently involved site.2,3 Because ENKTL is a recently recognized, distinct clinicopathologic entity in the World Health
Organization classification,4 to date, optimal treatment strategies for ENKTL and the prognosis for patients with the disease have not been fully defined. For patients with localized nasal disease, radiation therapy (RT) is widely administered,
because the response is rapid: RT produces complete response (CR) rates of up to 70%.5-7 However, approximately 50%
of patients who receive RT alone experience local relapse, and systemic failure reportedly occurs in approximately 25% of
patients.5 Therefore, the addition of chemotherapy is emphasized to reduce the risk of recurrence.8-12 Chemotherapy is
essential for advanced stages of nasal and extranasal ENKTL. However, treatment outcomes with conventional cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy are dismal, and >60% of patients have resistant disease.10-13 The high incidence of resistance to conventional chemotherapy with this subtype of lymphoma may be
related to overexpression of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) gene, with an increase in the amount of P-glycoprotein in

GELOX in the Treatment of ENKTL/Wang et al

NK/T-cell lymphoma cells.14 P-glycoprotein can actively
export doxorubicin and vincristine, the prime components of the CHOP regimen, leading to inferior treatment
outcomes. Recently, more and more novel regimens have
emerged with promising results, especially L-asparaginase–based regimens like combined dexamethasone,
methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide
(SMILE)15 and combined asparaginase, methotrexate,
and dexamethasone (AspaMetDex).16 Although high
response rate can be attained with SMILE, the toxicities
are nearly unacceptable. Whether the AspaMetDex regimen can achieve superior results in initial treatment needs
to be investigated in additional clinical trials. A gemcitabine and oxaliplatin salvage regimen has been proven
effective for patients with refractory or relapsed B-cell
lymphoma.17 Thus, we designed an induction chemotherapy regimen that consisted of combined gemcitabine,
oxaliplatin, and L-asparaginase (GELOX), all agents that
are not affected by P-glycoprotein. In addition, we added
involved-field RT (IFRT). The objective of this singlecenter, prospective study was to investigate the efficacy
and safety of GELOX followed by IFRT for the treatment
of stage IE/IIE ENKTL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

From January 2008 to July 2011, 35 patients with
ENKTL were admitted to the Department of Hematological Oncology, including 8 patients with stage III/IV disease, and all of these patients received GELOX as
induction chemotherapy. Of these, 27 patients with newly
diagnosed stage I and II ENKTL were enrolled in this
study. The primary site of all patients was the upper aerodigestive tract. All patients signed a written informed consent form before enrollment, and the study was approved
by the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center Research
Ethics Board. The inclusion criteria for this study were as
follows: 1) a biopsy-proven diagnosis of ENKTL; 2)
patients who were previously untreated; 3) Ann Arbor
stage IE through IIE disease; 4) adequate hematologic
function (eg, hemoglobin 90 g/L, absolute neutrophil
count >1.5  109/L, and platelet count >100  109/L),
renal function (eg, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL and creatinine clearance 50 mL/minute), and hepatic function
(eg, total bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal
and aspartate and alanine transaminase levels 3 times
the upper limit of normal); and 5) an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2. The diagnosis was made according to the presence of histologic
characteristics and immunophenotypes consistent with

ENKTL.4 Exclusion criteria included previous or concomitant malignancies and any coexisting medical problems that could cause poor compliance with the study
protocol. Other subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and
ENKTL with primary sites other than the upper aerodigestive tract were excluded.
Patients were staged based on the Ann Arbor staging
system, and International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores
were calculated based on demographic characteristics;
physical examination; routine blood tests; computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis;
magnetic resonance imaging studies of the head and neck;
and bilateral bone marrow aspiration or biopsy. Positron
emission tomography-CT scans, bone marrow EpsteinBarr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) staining, and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA blood levels were not routine staging investigations in the current study.
Treatment Protocol

The GELOX regimen consisted of gemcitabine (1000
mg/m2 as an intravenous drip on days 1 and 8), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 as an intravenous drip on day 1), and Lasparaginase (6000 IU/m2 daily as an intravenous drip on
days 1-7). The treatment cycle was repeated every 21 days.
Before the administration of L-asparaginase, an intradermal skin test was performed with 50 IU L-asparaginase
dissolved in 1 mL normal saline. After 1 hour, if no
obvious rash, erythema, pruritis, or other allergic reaction
occurred, then the patients received intravenous L-asparaginase 6000 IU/m2. Patients who experienced hypersensitivity to L-asparaginase received pegaspargase instead;
and, according to the dose intensity (ie, the dose of effective drug administered per unit of time [in mg/m2 per
week]), the GELOX regimen was modified as follows:
gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2 as an intravenous drip on day
1), oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2 as an intravenous drip on day
1), and pegaspargase (2500 IU/m2 daily as an intramuscular injection on day 1) repeated every 14 days. In the
GELOX regimen, the dose intensity of gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin was 667 mg/m2 per week and 43 mg/m2 per
week, respectively; and it was 625 mg/m2 per week and
42.5 mg/m2 per week, respectively, for the pegaspargasecontaining regimen). During chemotherapy intervals,
patients with hematologic toxicities who had a peripheral
white blood cell count <2.0  109/L received granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (5 lg/kg daily) until neutrophil recovery. Patients received the chemotherapy
regimens only if their the absolute neutrophil count was
1.5  109/L and their platelet count was 75  109/L
before each cycle. If patients developed grade 4
349

Original Article

hematologic toxicity, then the doses of all chemotherapy
drugs were reduced by 20% in all subsequent cycles. After
at least 2 cycles of GELOX, patients were referred for
IFRT. Then, they received GELOX for 2 to 4 cycles
within 1 week after the completion of IFRT, resulting in a
maximum total of 6 cycles of GELOX. Second-line chemotherapy was received by patients who suffered from progressive disease during GELOX chemotherapy. Primary
IFRT was delivered using 6-MeV linear accelerator using
3-dimensional conformal treatment planning. The IFRT
dose was 56 grays (Gy) in 28 fractions, with 2 Gy a day
and 5 fractions each week. We defined the clinical target
volume of limited stage IE disease as the bilateral nasal
cavity, bilateral ethmoid sinuses, and ipsilateral maxillary
sinus; and the clinical target volume extended to involved
tissues for patients who had extensive stage IE disease. For
patients who had stage IIE disease, the clinical target volume also included the bilateral cervical lymph node area.
Response and Safety Assessments

Tumor response was assessed after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy or before and after RT on the basis of standardized response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.18
After the completion of therapy, patients were evaluated
by their oncologists in the outpatient department. The
follow-up frequency after treatment was every 2 months
in the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 3
years, and annually thereafter. Each follow-up visit
included a physical examination, routine blood tests, and
a CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the involved
area for each patient. The primary endpoints were toxicity
and the response rate (the proportion of patients who
achieved a CR and a partial response [PR]). All adverse
effects after chemotherapy were graded based on version
3.0 of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria of Adverse Events. Secondary endpoints were
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
PFS was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date
of disease progression and was censored at the date of the
last follow-up visit. OS was calculated from the date of
diagnosis to the date of death from any cause and was
censored at the date of the last follow-up visit.
Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics
18.0 software (Apache Software Foundation, Forest Hill,
Md). Survival functions were estimated using the KaplanMeier method and were compared using the log-rank test.
Differences between the results from comparative tests were
considered significant if the 2-sided P value was <.05.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Characteristics of all patients are provided in Table 1. Tumor immunophenotypic analysis indicated that all 27
patients had CD56-positive disease, and 25 patients
(92.6%) had cytoplasmic CD3-positive status. T-cell intracellular antigen was expressed in all 27 patients
(100%). Among the 24 patients had in situ hybridization
analysis of EBV RNA, all 24 (100%) were positive for
EBER. In this cohort of 27 patients with ENKTL, 16
patients (59.3%) were men. The mean patient age was 47
years (range, 21-74 years), and 4 patients (14.8%) were
aged >60 years. B symptoms were present in 10 patients
(37%), and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were
increased in only 3 patients (11.1%). Locoregional lymph
nodes were involved in 11 patients (40.7%). The distribution of IPI score included 22 patients (81.5%) with an IPI
score of 0 and 5 patients (18.5%) with an IPI score of 1.
Response to Treatment

All patients with stage IE/IIE disease received at least 2
cycles of GELOX followed by IFRT. In total, 138 cycles

of GELOX treatment were administered, and the median
number of cycles per patient was 6 for the entire group
(range, 2-6 cycles per patients). After 2 cycles of GELOX,
there were 15 CRs (55.6%), 10 PRs (37%), and 2 patients
had stable disease (7.4%). All patients responded to chemotherapy, and no patient experienced disease progression
during chemotherapy. IFRT was received by all patients
and was delivered as scheduled after at least 2 cycles of
chemotherapy. After IFRT, the CR rate increased to
66.7% (18 of 27 patients), the PR rate was 29.6% (8 of
27 patients), and only 1 patient (3.7%) retained stable disease. At the end of treatment, the objective response rate
was 96.3%, which included 20 patients (74.1%) who had
a CR and 6 patients who had a PR (22.2%). No patients
suffered from disease progression during therapy. Table 2
indicates that there was no significant difference in treatment outcomes between the L-asparaginase–containing
regimen and the pegaspargase-containing regimen.
Eight patients with stage III/IV disease received
GELOX off study. Two patients were lost to follow-up after the first cycle of treatment. Of the remaining 6 patients
(2 with stage III disease and 4 with stage IV disease; 6-8

cycles of GELOX were received), 2 patients attained a CR
after 4 cycles of GELOX, 3 patients attained a PR at the
end of treatment, and 1 patient had progressive disease after the first cycle of GELOX that was successfully salvaged
with infusional etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin
with bolus cyclophosphamide (the EPOCH regimen). After a median follow-up of 10.84 months (range, 3.1427.21 months), 2 patients died 3.14 months and 7.80
months after the start of treatment, and the remaining 4
patients remained alive without disease progression.
Toxicity

The adverse effects of GELOX are summarized in Table
3. Grade 1 and 2 toxicities were frequent during GELOX
treatment. The major side effects were leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, liver dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, and dysfunction of blood
coagulation. In total, 24 patients developed a decrease in
fibrinogen, which was treated with fresh-frozen plasma
and cryoprecipitate. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were few.
Five patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Three of 27 patients (11.1%) had a delay in

chemotherapy because of an abnormal liver function test
(grade 3 in 1 patient and grade 2 in 2 patients). A diabetic
individual (1 of 27 patients; 3.7%) refused L-asparaginase
therapy after 2 cycles of GELOX (this patient received
only gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in the subsequent 4
cycles of chemotherapy) because of uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Seven patients had a positive reaction to the Lasparaginase skin test, but pegaspargase was well tolerated
in all of them. Grade 1 and 2 mucositis and dermatitis
were frequent during IFRT, and the rates of grade 3
mucositis and dermatitis were 14.8% and 11.1%, respectively. No patient developed grade 4 adverse effects during
IFRT. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Relapse and Survival

At a median follow-up of 27.37 months (range, 2.8648.69 months), 7 of 27 patients (25.9%) experienced disease progression at a median of 22.93 months (range,
5.03-29.01 months), and 4 of those patients died of disease at a median of 19.22 months (range, 5.03-28.85
months). Figure 1 indicates that the 2-year OS rate and
the 2-year PFS rate were both 86%. Three patients developed distant progression during follow-up, including 1
patient who experienced a relapse in his lung and 2 who
developed liver metastasis. All 3 of these died after failure
of the salvage treatment. Local progression was observed
in 4 patients, including 1 patient who had a relapse in the
submandibular lymph nodes, 1 patient who had a relapse
in the left maxillary sinus within his prior radiation field,
and 2 patients who had relapses in the nasal cavity. After
disease progression, patients received either combined
ifosfamide, etoposide, and methotrexate (IMVP-16) or
352

combined dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and
cisplatin (DHAP) chemotherapy as salvage treatment. Figure 2 demonstrates that the patients who had a CR at the
end of treatment had significantly longer PFS (P ¼ .012)
and OS (P ¼ .021) than patients who did not have a CR.
DISCUSSION
In this pilot study, we explored frontline treatment with
nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy, including gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and L-asparaginase (GELOX), followed by IFRT for the treatment of patients with stage
IE/IIE nasal ENKTL. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, gemcitabine is considered a promising substitute for cytarabine because of its greater single-drug activity, good safety
features, and synergistic effect with platinum complexes.19-21 Moreover, oxaliplatin is also an effective drug
in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and its single-drug activity
can reach an objective response rate of 27% to 40%.22
When gemcitabine and oxaliplatin were used in combination, a promising synergistic effect was observed in vitro
and in clinical studies with lymphoma.19,23 L-asparaginase has a special anticancer mechanism. It can hydrolyze
and exhaust serum asparagines in NK/T-cell lymphoma
cells, which cannot synthesize L-asparagines by themselves, and finally produces an anticancer effect.24 Previous studies have demonstrated that L-asparaginase–based
chemotherapy regimens produced outstanding response
rates in patients with refractory or relapsed ENKTL.25
The GELOX regimen takes advantage of the combination
of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and L-asparaginase, all of
which are nonanthracycline drugs that demonstrated significant activity and nonoverlapping toxicity in previous

studies. In the current study, using GELOX, we achieved
a satisfactory response rate with acceptable toxicity.
RT is an important treatment modality for ENKTL
and is useful to control locoregional disease. The 5-year
OS rate ranged from 37.9% to 66% in patients with stage
IE through IIE disease who received IFRT alone,26-28
which was attributed to local relapse and distant progression after RT. Because of the high systemic failure rate after RT, combined chemotherapy plus RT is the mainstay
of treatment. However, in previous studies, anthracyclinebased chemotherapy like CHOP followed by RT resulted
in a CR rate of 58%, and scheduled RT was received by
only 35% of patients because of early progression.10 As an
historical control, 125 patients at our center who had
stage I through II ENKTL with good IPI scores (0-1)
received with CHOP plus IFRT; after induction chemotherapy with CHOP, their CR rate was 31.8%, which
increased to 69.6% after RT; the 2-year OS and PFS rates
were 60.2% and 49.1%, respectively (unpublished data).
In our current study, the CR rate at the end of treatment
was 74.1%, which is higher than the rates reported in the
previous study that used anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by RT.10 It is noteworthy that all but of 2
patients (92.6%) in our current study responded to chemotherapy, and the remaining 2 patients achieved disease
control after 2 cycles of GELOX. None of these patients
experienced disease progression during chemotherapy;
thus, the planned RT was delivered on time for all
patients. Moreover, the 2-year OS rate and the 2-year PFS
rate both were 86.0% in our study, which is significantly
higher than our historical control data, indicating that
Cancer

January 15, 2013

GELOX chemotherapy was more active than anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The frontline use of ‘‘sandwich’’ L-asparaginase, vincristine, and prednisone with
RT, which also is a nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy
regimen, produced a response rate of 88.5%, which
included an 80.8% CR rate and a 7.7% PR rate in patients
with newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKTL.29 This CR
rate was comparable to that in our current study, but our
objective response rate was slightly higher. However, 3 of
26 patients (11.5%) progressed during sandwich L-asparaginase, vincristine, and prednisone treatment; and no
patients in our study experienced such progression. Compared with the results from another study that used doseintensified CHOP followed by RT,30 our distant relapse
rate was lower (11.1% vs 29.4%, respectively). Therefore,
our treatment strategy with GELOX and IFRT may
reduce local relapse and systemic relapse. At a median follow-up of 27.37 months, only 7 of our 27 patients
(25.9%) experienced disease progression. Although the
follow-up in our study was relatively short, the recurrence
peak did not appear 2 years after the completion of treatment. This demonstrates the efficacy of GELOX and indicates that RT should be added to these nonanthracyclinebased chemotherapy regimens.
Although grade 1 and 2 toxicities were frequent during GELOX, grades 3 and 4 toxicities were few. The most
common adverse effects, such as liver dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, and dysfunction of blood coagulation, can
be well controlled by supportive treatments. It is important to note that 7 patients (25.9%) had positive results
from the L-asparaginase skin test, and pegaspargase was
353

Original Article

used instead, which resulted in similar rates of CR, 2-year
OS, and 2-year PFS. However, the sample size was too
small in the pegaspargase-containing arm; thus, further
trials comparing these 2 regimens are required. Because Lasparaginase is a nonhuman protein, antibody response
results not only in anaphylactic and other immunologic
side effects but also in inactivation of the product.31
Pegaspargase, the monoethoxypolyethylene glycol succinimidyl conjugate of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase, has
decreased immunogenicity and has a longer half-life than
L-asparaginase,32 and it maintains asparagine depletion
equivalent to higher doses and prolonged administration
of the native preparations. Thus, if antibodies to L-asparaginase are detected in patients who previously received
L-asparaginase therapy or if patients exhibit hypersensitivity to L-asparaginase, then L-asparaginase may be
switched to pegaspargase. The hematologic toxicities in
our study were much milder than those reported with the
CHOP and SMILE regimens.15 During the study period,
no thrombosis occurred in our patients. However, thrombosis is a known adverse event of asparaginase; thus,
patients must be monitored closely for thrombosis during
follow-up and in subsequent trials.
An analysis of EBV DNA was not included in our
study. However, more and more studies have indicated
that the plasma EBV DNA load at presentation is associated with clinical disease stage and treatment response,33
and patients with a high EBV DNA load have a poorer
prognosis (the 3-year OS rates were 42.9% and 94.4% in
patients with positive and negative plasma EBV DNA status, respectively; P ¼ .0009).34 Thus, our study protocol
will be modified to include an analysis of EBV DNA, and
we suggest it should be included in subsequent trials that
investigate NK/T-cell lymphoma to evaluate the role of
EBV DNA detection for uniformly treated patients. Thus,
we conclude that GELOX followed by IFRT can be a feasible and effective treatment strategy for patients with stage
IE through IIE upper aerodigestive tract ENKTL and
requires further investigation in larger prospective trials.
