ABSTRACT
Malignant melanoma requires precise resection in order to avoid metastatic
recurrence. We report here that the telomerase-dependent, green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-containing adenovirus OBP-401 could label malignant melanoma with GFP
in situ in orthotopic mouse models. OBP-401-based fluorescence-guided surgery
(FGS) resulted in the complete resection of malignant melanoma in the orthotopic
models, where conventional bright-light surgery (BLS) could not. High-dose
administration of OBP-401 enabled FGS without residual cancer cells or recurrence,
due to its dual effect of cancer-cell labeling with GFP and killing.

strategies. We previously developed a curative strategy
for FGS of GBM using high-dose OBP-401 to selectively
label GBM with GFP. OBP-401-based FGS enabled
curative resection of GBM without recurrence for at least
150 days, compared to less than 30 days with BLS [6].
OBP-401-based FGS resulted in superior resection
of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) in an orthotopic nude mouse
model, compared to BLS. High-dose OBP-401 enabled
FGS without residual sarcoma cells or local or metastatic
recurrence, due to its dual effect of cancer-cell labeling
with GFP and killing. High-dose OBP-401 based-FGS
improved disease-free survival as well as preserved
muscle function compared with BLS [7].
OBP-401 was used to label the cancer cells of a
pancreatic cancer patient-derived orthotopic xenograft
(PDOX) nude mouse model. The PDOX was previously
grown in a red fluorescent protein (RFP) transgenic mouse
that stably labeled the PDOX stroma cells bright red. The
color-coded PDOX model enabled FGS to completely
resect the pancreatic tumors including stroma. Dualcolored FGS significantly prevented local recurrence,

INTRODUCTION
Despite recent advances, the current therapeutic
approaches in melanoma are not satisfactory and intensive
research in this area is still required [1].
Cancer surgery requires precise identification
of tumor margins. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)
fluorescence can intensely illuminate even single cells
in vivo [2, 3]. Introducing and selectively activating
the GFP gene in tumors in vivo was made possible by
the development of OBP-401, a telomerase-dependent,
replication-competent adenovirus expressing GFP. In an
intraperitoneal nude mouse model of disseminated human
colon cancer, fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) enabled
resection of tumor nodules labeled with GFP by OBP-401
[4]. Recurrent tumor nodules brightly expressed GFP,
indicating that initial OBP-401-GFP labeling of peritoneal
disease was genetically stable [5].
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the
most invasive of cancers and is not totally resectable
using standard bright-light surgery (BLS) or current FGS

which bright-light surgery or single-color FGS could
not. FGS, with color-coded cancer and stroma cells
has important potential for improving the outcome of
recalcitrant-cancer surgery [8].
OBP-401-FGS of tumors in the lung enabled complete
lung tumor resection with no residual fluorescent tumor [9].
OBP-401 tumor illumination enabled effective FGS
of an orthotopic mouse model of human osteosarcoma
model as well as eradication of residual osteosarcoma
cells after BLS. OBP-401-FGS significantly inhibited
local recurrence and lung metastasis after surgery thereby
prolonging survival [10].
In the present report, we demonstrate that OBP-401
GFP labeling in situ enables precise FGS of malignant
melanoma without recurrence.

Supplementary Figure S2B). OBP-401 conferred GFP
fluorescence of the orthotopic melanoma which was
sufficiently bright to perform complete resection using the
OV100 whole body imaging system (Figure 2B). Tumor
imaging showed that OBP-401 GFP labeling co-localized
with tumor RFP fluorescence (Figure 2B, 2C). OBP401-GFP-targeted FGS resulted in no detectable residual
melanoma cells (Figure 2B, 2D).

OBP-401-FGS of malignant melanoma using
a hand-held portable fluorescence imaging
system
OBP-401-GFP targeting enabled the use of the
Dino-Lite hand-held portable fluorescence imager [11]
for FGS (Figure 3). OBP-401-GFP labeling for four days
made the tumor margin much clearer than under brightlight (Figure 3A). Using the Dino-Lite, the tumor margin
was clearly visualized enabling complete resection of
the malignant melanoma (Figure 4B, Supplementary
Movie S1). Fluorescence imaging showed that there
were no residual cancer cells after OBP-401 FGS of
malignant melanoma with the Dino-Lite (Figures 3, 4).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
OBP-401 targets malignant melanoma cell lines
with GFP in vitro
Time-course imaging demonstrated that OBP-401
labeled RFP-expressing Mel526, FEMX1, LOMVIXI,
MV3 malignant melanoma cells with GFP (Figure 1A).
GFP fluorescence, after OBP-401 targeting of Mel526,
FEMX1, LOMVIXI, MV3 cells, became stronger each
day from day 2 to day 7 (Figure 1A, 1B).

OBP-401-FGS targets residual melanoma cells
in the orthotopic model after BLS and enables
complete resection
OBP-401 was intratumorally injected 3 days
before BLS of FEMX1-RFP melanoma growing in the
femoral skin (Supplementary Figure 3). OBP-401 enabled
detection of the residual cancer cells at the single cell level
in the surgical bed after BLS using a whole body imaging
system (OV100) (Figure 4A). After OBP-401-FGS, there
were no detectable residual cancer cells (Figure 4B, 4C).
OBP-401 delineated the precise margins between cancer
and normal tissue. OBP-401 enabled determination
whether there were residual cancer cells at the singlecell level after FGS using confocal microscopy (FV1000)
(Figure 4D, 4E).

Orthotopic malignant melanoma model
An orthotopic malignant melanoma tumor model was
established with FEMX1-RFP cells implanted in the femoral
skin where FEMX1-RFP cells produced a nodular tumor
(Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B). The orthotopicallygrowing malignant melanoma cells invaded the quadriceps
femoris muscle and metastasized to lymph nodes similar
to the clinical course of melanoma (Supplementary Figure
S1C). Tumor growth was visualized by RFP fluorescence
(Supplementary Figure S1C).

Bright-light surgery results in residual
melanoma cells in the orthotopic model

High-dose OBP-401 kills melanoma cells
growing orthotopically in vivo, thereby enabling
minimal surgery

We performed bright-light surgery (BLS) on the
orthotopic malignant melanoma model (Figure 2A,
Supplementary Figure S2A). Due to inability to clearly
visualize the tumor margins, extensive RFP-expressing
malignant melanoma cells remained after BLS (Figure
2A, 2D).

High-dose OBP-401 targeted and killed Mel526RFP, FEMX1-RFP, LOMVIXI-RFP, MV3-RFP cells in
a dose-dependent manner in vitro (Figure 5). Therefore,
we determined whether high-dose OBP-401 (2×108
PFU)FGS enabled minimally-invasive surgery of
melanoma compared with BLS or low-dose FGS. Highdose OBP-401 injected i.t. significantly reduced the size
of tumors compared with untreated control tumors or
low-dose OBP-401 (Figure 6A, 6B). The surgical area
necessary for high-dose OBP-401 FGS was smaller than
that for BLS or low-dose OBP-401 FGS (Figure 6C, 6D).

was less than that by BLS or low-dose OBP-401 FGS due
to the cytotoxic effects of OBP-401 (Figure 6E).

Labeling tumors with OBP-401 for FGS has none of
the weaknesses of non-genetic labeling, particularly loss
of label over time and limited expression of the marker
used for labeling. OBP-401 may be a general method for
labeling tumors that express telomerase, which are the vast
majority, that could have broad application for FGS.
A Phase I clinical trial of i.t. injection of OBP301, the parent of OBP-401, in patients with advanced
solid tumors was well tolerated [12]. Melanoma occurs
intracutaneously, and therefore OBP-401 could be directly
delivered and be tested in the clinic in the near future.
Concepts and strategies of highly-selective tumor
targeting that were previously developed [13–17] can take
advantage of adenoviral targeting of tumors, including

OBP-401 based FGS resulted in
recurrence-free surgery
Fluorescence imaging showed that eight of twelve
mice that underwent BLS had RFP-expressing local
recurrences (Figure 7A, 7D and 7E). In contrast, there was
no local recurrence in twelve mice which received lowdose OBP-401-FGS (Figure 7B, 7D and 7E). Moreover,
there was also no local recurrence in ten mice which
received minimal surgery after high-dose administration
of OBP-401 (Figure 7C, 7D and 7E) (Table 1).

tissue-selective therapy which focuses on unique
properties of normal and tumor tissues [13, 15, 18]. OBP401 can possibly overcome de-differentiation of a tumor
leading to resistance to targeted chemotherapy, because the
targeted protein or pathway may no longer be expressed
[18], since OBP-401 does not depend on such targets
[15], but depends only on telomerase expression which
is expected to be stable in cancer cells. OBP-401 may
also be effectively combined with teratogens which could
selectively effect cancer cells that are dedifferentiated [14].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since OBP-401 can decoy quiescent cancer cells to begin
to cycle [19], OBP-401 could be effectively combined
with agents which selectively target proliferating cancer
cells [16], where normal cells are protected by agents
which induce wild type p53 [17].
Other fluorescence methods of labeling tumors are
also available. Fluorescence labeling at long wavelengths,
such as near infrared (NIR), enables potential greater
depth of visualization of the label, but such non-genetic
methods will not label recurrent tumors [20].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

OBP-401 based fluorescence-guided surgery
(OBP-401-FGS)

GFP-expressing telomerase-specific adenovirus

All animal procedures were performed under
anesthesia using s.c. administration of a ketamine mixture
[10 μl ketamine HCl, 7.6 μl xylazine, 2.4 μl acepromazine
maleate, and 10 μl PBS]. Orthotopic melanoma labeled
with GFP by OBP-401 was observed with noninvasive
fluorescence imaging using the OV100 Small Animal
Imaging System (Olympus) [22]. OBP-401 FGS was
performed using either the OV100 or a Dino-Lite hand-held
fluorescence scope (Dino-Lite digital camera, AM4113TGFBW Dino-Lite Premier; AnMo Electronics Corp.,
Hsinchu, Taiwan) [11]. After surgery, the presence of cancer
cells was observed with the OV100 and Dino-Lite. If there
were residual cancer cells, an additional resection was
performed [7].

In OBP-401, the promoter element of the human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene drives the
expression of E1A and E1B genes, linked to an internal
ribosome entry site, for selective replication only in cancer
cells. The GFP gene is driven by the CMV promoter
inserted in OBP-401 [21].

Cell line and cell culture
Red fluorescent protein-expressing human
malignant melanoma cell lines Mel526-RFP, FEMXRFP, LOMVIXI-RFP, and MV3-RFP (AntiCancer, Inc.,
San Diego, CA) were maintained and cultured in DMEM
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5%
penicillin/streptomycin.

Statistical analysis
Data are shown as means ± SD. For comparison
between two groups, significant differences were
determined using the Student’s t-test. For comparison
of more than two groups, statistical significance was
determined with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by a Bonferroni multiple group comparison test.
Pearson chi-square analysis was used to compare the rate
of local recurrence between BLS and OBP-401-FGS.
Statistical analysis for disease-free survival and over-all
survival was performed using the Kaplan-Meier test along
with log-rank test. Pearson chi-square analysis was used
to evaluate the rate of local recurrence and lung metastasis
between BLS and OBP-401-FGS. P values of < 0.05 were
considered significant.

In vitro imaging
Time-course imaging of OBP-401-GFP labeling
of melanoma cell lines was performed with an FV1000
confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).

Animal experiments
Athymic (nu/nu) nude mice (AntiCancer, Inc., San
Diego, CA) were kept in a barrier facility under HEPA
filtration. Mice were fed with autoclaved laboratory rodent
diet (Tecklad LM-485, Western Research Products).
All animal studies were conducted in accordance with
the principles and procedures outlined in the National
Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals under Assurance Number A3873– 01.
