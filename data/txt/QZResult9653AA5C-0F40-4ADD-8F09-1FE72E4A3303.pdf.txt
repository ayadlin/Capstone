Abstract
The p75NTR acts as a tumor suppressor in the prostate, but its
expression is lost as prostate cancer progresses and is minimal
in established prostate cancer cell lines such as PC-3, DU-145,
and LNCaP. Previously, we showed that treatment with
R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen induced p75NTR expression in
PC-3 and DU-145 cells leading to p75NTR-mediated decreased
survival. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which these
drugs induce p75NTR expression. We show that the observed
increase in p75NTR protein due to R-flurbiprofen and
ibuprofen treatment was accompanied by an increase in
p75NTR mRNA, and this increase in mRNA was the result of
increased mRNA stability and not by an up-regulation of
transcription. In addition, we show that treatment with
R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen led to sustained activation of
the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
Furthermore, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway with the
p38 MAPK–specific inhibitor SB202190 or by small interfering
RNA (siRNA) knockdown of p38 MAPK protein prevented
induction of p75NTR by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. We also
observed that siRNA knockdown of MAPK-activated protein
kinase (MK)-2 and MK3, the kinases downstream of p38 MAPK
that are responsible for the mRNA stabilizing effects of the
p38 MAPK pathway, also prevented an induction of p75NTR
by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. Finally, we identify the
RNA stabilizing protein HuR and the posttranscriptional
regulator eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E as two
possible mechanisms by which the p38 MAPK pathway may
increase p75NTR expression. Collectively, the data suggest that
R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen induce p75NTR expression by
increased mRNA stability that is mediated through the p38
MAPK pathway. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11402–10]

Introduction
The p75NTR (neurotrophin receptor) is a member of the tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily that share a conserved
intracellular death domain capable of inducing apoptosis and
suppressing growth (1, 2). It binds neurotrophin ligands with
similar affinity; however, unlike other members of the TNF receptor
superfamily, it is able to induce apoptosis and suppress growth in
the unbound state (3–8). p75NTR has been shown to act as a tumor
suppressor in the prostate (5, 7, 9). However, whereas normal

prostate epithelial cells express high levels of p75NTR , expression is
lost as prostate cancer progresses (10). In addition, although the
gene remains intact, expression is very low in metastatic prostate
cancer cell lines PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP (10). Exogenous
reexpression of p75NTR in PC-3 cells led to increased apoptosis,
reduced proliferation, and a decreased ability of these cells to form
tumors in mice, thus indicating potential for treatments that result
in the reexpression of p75NTR in prostate tumor cells (5, 7–9, 11).
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are typically used to
relieve inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity;
however, many of these drugs seem to possess anticancer activity
that is independent of their COX inhibitory activity (12).
Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen are members of the aryl propionic
acid class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also referred to
as profens, and have shown anticancer activity in the prostate.
For example, treatment with the enantiomer R-flurbiprofen, which
lacks COX inhibitory activity, was able to slow progression of
prostate cancer in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse
prostate mouse (13). In addition, long-term ibuprofen use has been
associated with decreased prostate cancer risk, and treatment of
prostate cancer cells with ibuprofen resulted in decreased survival
(14–16). Recently, we showed that treatment of PC-3 and DU-145
prostate cancer cells with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen resulted in a
strong induction of p75NTR , which led to p75NTR-mediated
apoptosis and decreased survival (17). The results of this study
were significant because they showed that p75NTR expression is
inducible, and that drugs which induce p75NTR in prostate cancer
cells have therapeutic potential.
The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is
activated in response to cell stresses and external stimuli such as
heat, UV light, osmotic shock, and inflammatory cytokines (18).
It mediates various cellular processes including apoptosis,
senescence, inflammation, and tumorigenesis through decreased
p38 MAPK activity, which has been associated with tumor
progression (18–20). In addition, p38 MAPK has been strongly
implicated as a regulator of mRNA stability (18, 21, 22). p38 MAPK
is activated through phosphorylation by upstream kinases MAPK
kinase kinase (MKK)-3 and MKK6 and, on activation, phosphorylates a number of downstream targets (18). Among these targets
are the kinases MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK)-2 and MK3,
which have been shown to be responsible for mediating the effects
of the p38 MAPK pathway on mRNA stability (21, 23).
In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which the
profens, R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen, induce p75NTR expression in
PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We showed that
induction of p75NTR protein expression corresponded to increased
p75NTR mRNA levels that were due to increased mRNA stability and
not to an up-regulation of transcription. In addition, we showed
that R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen treatment led to sustained
activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and that this pathway was
necessary for induction of p75NTR expression.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, culture conditions, and reagents. PC-3 and DU-145 cells,
the only two prostate tumor cell lines included in the NIH Developmental
Therapeutics Program anticancer drug discovery program, and the
androgen receptor–responsive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells were
purchased from the tissue culture core facility of the Georgetown University
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and maintained as previously
described (17).
Ibuprofen (Sigma Chemical Co.) and R-flurbiprofen (Myriad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) were dissolved in DMSO and used at final concentrations of
0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mmol/L. Actinomycin D (Tocris Bioscience) and
SB202190 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in DMSO and used at final
concentrations of 5 Ag/mL and 20 Amol/L, respectively.
Reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done with the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR
System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) using equal
amounts of RNA according to the following program: 47jC for 30 min; 94jC
for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94jC for 1 min, 60jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 1 min;
and 72jC for 5 min. Primers for p75NTR and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were described previously (17).
Immunoblot analysis. Lysates were prepared as described previously
(11). Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared with a nuclear
extract kit (Active Motif). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were done as
described previously (17). The following primary antibodies were used:
mouse monoclonal anti-p75NTR (Millipore; 1:2,000); rabbit polyclonal
antibodies to phosphorylated p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, p38a, phosphorylated
MK2, MK2, phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E), and eIF4E (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000); rabbit polyclonal
anti-HuR (Millipore; 1:1,000); mouse monoclonal anti-p38h (Zymed
Laboratories) and anti-MK3 (Affinity BioReagents; 2 Ag/mL); mouse
monoclonal anti-Hu protein (Abcam, Inc.; 1:1,000); mouse monoclonal
anti–a-tubulin and rabbit polyclonal anti–lamin B1 (Abcam; 1:3,000); and
mouse monoclonal anti–h-actin (Sigma; 1:5,000). Goat anti-mouse and goat
anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (BioRad Laboratories) were used at 1:3,000. Membranes used for detection of
phosphorylated p38 MAPK, MK2, or eIF4E were subsequently stripped and
reprobed for total p38 MAPK, MK2, or eIF4E, respectively.
Small interfering RNA transfection. Cells were transfected for 72 h with
nontargeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) or siRNA specific for p38a
(J-003512-20), p38h (J-003972-11), MK2 (J-003516-11), MK3 (J-005014-07), or
HuR (J-003773-08; Dharmacon RNA Technologies) at final concentrations of
100 nmol/L according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfection reagent
DharmaFECT 1 was used for DU-145 cells and DharmaFECT 2 was used for
PC-3 and LNCaP cells (Dharmacon).
Luciferase assay. PC-3, DU-145, and A875 cells were cotransfected with
either the pGL3-2.1 kb p75NTR promoter-luciferase construct (gift from Emil
Bogenmann, Children’s Hospital, Los Angeles, CA) or empty vector and the
Renilla luciferase reporter vector phRL-TK (Promega) using GeneJammer
transfection reagent (Stratagene) for 48 h. Following transfection, PC-3
and DU-145 cells were treated with 2 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen, 2 mmol/L
ibuprofen, or DMSO vehicle control for 24 h, whereas A875 cells were
treated with isotonic medium (320 mosm/L) or hypoosmotic medium
(160 mosm/L) prepared by a 1:1 dilution of complete medium with water.
Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega) and normalized to the empty vector and Renilla luciferase
activity.
Immunoprecipitation RT-PCR. Equal numbers of treated cells were
collected, washed in cold PBS, and incubated on ice for 30 min in 1 mL of
lysis buffer (1% Igepal Ca-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS)
containing 10 Ag/mL Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma) and 100 units of
RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) per sample. Samples were then centrifuged at
10,000  g for 15 min at 4jC. Ten micrograms of HuR antibody (Millipore)
were added to the supernatant of each sample, with the exception of the
negative controls, and samples were rocked at 4jC for 30 min. Fifty
microliters of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies)

www.aacrjournals.org

were added to each sample, and samples were rocked at 4jC for 30 min.
Samples were centrifuged at 2,000  g for 2 min at 4jC, the supernatant
was discarded, and the beads were washed eight times with 1 mL of lysis
buffer. RNA was isolated from the beads using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacture’s protocol. RT-PCR was done as described
above for determination of p75NTR mRNA level using equal volumes of RNA
and 32 cycles of PCR.

Results
R-Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen increase p75NTR mRNA level.
To determine the mechanism by which the profens, R-flurbiprofen
and ibuprofen, induce p75NTR expression in PC-3 and DU-145
human prostate cancer cell lines, we first compared the levels
of p75NTR protein and mRNA following treatment with various
concentrations of each profen (Fig. 1A). There was a strong
correlation between p75NTR protein and mRNA, indicating that
increased mRNA levels are responsible for the induction of p75NTR
protein by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. A strong increase in
p75NTR protein and mRNA levels was observed in PC-3 cells following treatment with 0.5 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen and 1.0 mmol/L
ibuprofen, and in DU-145 cells with 1.0 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen
and 2.0 mmol/L ibuprofen. Therefore, in subsequent experiments,
we used 2.0 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen because at
this concentration, each of these profens induced high levels of
p75NTR in both cell types. The level of p75NTR mRNA was also
determined at various time points following profen treatment,
and an induction was first observed within 2 to 4 h of treatment
(Fig. 1B). We also compared levels of p75NTR protein and mRNA
in the androgen-responsive LNCaP cell line following treatment
with several concentrations of ibuprofen, and again observed a
strong correlation between p75NTR protein and mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In addition, we observed a similar time course
for induction of p75NTR mRNA in LNCaP cells treated with
ibuprofen (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
R-Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen increase p75NTR mRNA
stability. Because the amount of transcript in a cell is a function
of the rate of transcription and the rate of degradation, the
observed increase in p75NTR mRNA in PC-3 and DU-145 cells
following R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen treatment must be due to
either an up-regulation of transcriptional activity or a decrease in
the rate of degradation of the p75NTR transcript, or both. Thus, we
examined transcriptional activity and mRNA stability following
treatment with profens. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were transfected
with a p75NTR promoter-luciferase construct followed by treatment
with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen, and promoter activity was
compared with DMSO control–treated cells (Fig. 2A). Treatment
with profens did not result in a significant change in p75NTR
promoter activity, suggesting that the increase in mRNA was not
due to transcriptional up-regulation of the p75NTR gene. Previously,
p75NTR promoter activity was shown to be up-regulated in the
A875 melanoma cell line on exposure to hypoosmotic medium (24).
Therefore, to show that the p75NTR promoter-luciferase construct
was functional, we transfected A875 cells with the construct and
compared luciferase activity in cells exposed to isotonic versus
hypoosmotic medium. Consistent with previously published data,
treatment with hypoosmotic medium resulted in 17-fold increased
p75NTR promoter activity (Fig. 2A; ref. 24). Therefore, increased
levels of p75NTR mRNA and protein in PC-3 and DU-145 cells
treated with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen were not a consequence of
changed transcriptional activity.

Figure 1. A, p75NTR mRNA and protein levels following R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen treatment. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were treated with 0 to 2 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen
or ibuprofen for 24 h. Cell lysates were collected and equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with an antibody to p75NTR
or h-actin (b-act) for the loading control. Alternatively, RNA was isolated from PC-3 and DU-145 cells after 24 h of R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen treatment, and p75NTR and
GAPDH mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. B, time course induction of p75NTR mRNA levels. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were treated with 2 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen
or ibuprofen for 0, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h. RNA was isolated at each time point and levels of p75NTR and GAPDH were determined by RT-PCR.

The stability of the p75NTR transcript was determined with the
transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. PC-3 and DU-145 cells
were treated with R-flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, or DMSO for 8 h
followed by the addition of actinomycin D. p75NTR mRNA level was
determined by RT-PCR at several time points following actinomycin D addition (Fig. 2B and C). The majority of p75NTR mRNA from
DMSO control–treated PC-3 and DU-145 cells was degraded within
2 and 4 h, respectively. In contrast, p75NTR mRNA was still present
at high levels in profen-treated cells 12 h following the addition of
actinomycin D. Therefore, profen treatment strongly enhanced
p75NTR mRNA stability but did not influence transcription,
suggesting that increased mRNA stability is responsible for the
induction of p75NTR expression by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen
(Fig. 2). We also observed an increase in p75NTR mRNA stability
in LNCaP cells treated with ibuprofen relative to DMSO control–
treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D).
R-Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen activate the p38 MAPK
pathway. The p38 MAPK pathway has been strongly implicated
in the stabilization of several mRNAs through the downstream
kinases MK2 and MK3, which are activated upon phosphorylation
by p38 MAPK (21, 23). p38 MAPK is also activated by phosphorylation. Therefore, we determined the phosphorylation status of p38
MAPK and MK2 at several time points in PC-3 and DU-145 cells
following treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen and in LNCaP
cells following treatment with ibuprofen (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). In all cases, profen treatment led to sustained activa-

tion of the p38 MAPK pathway, which could be observed even 8 h
after treatment of each cell line.
The p38 MAPK pathway is involved in the induction of
p75NTR by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. Increased p75NTR
mRNA stability seems to be the mechanism by which Rflurbiprofen and ibuprofen induce p75NTR expression, and these
drugs activate the p38 MAPK pathway, which is known to be
involved in mRNA stabilization. Pretreatment of PC-3 and DU-145
cells with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 followed by treatment
with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen prevented an induction of p75NTR ,
indicating that p38 MAPK is involved in profen-mediated induction
of p75NTR (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the role of the p38 MAPK
pathway in profen-mediated induction of p75NTR , we also used p38
MAPK siRNA to specifically knock down p38 MAPK protein. There
are two ubiquitously expressed isoforms of p38 MAPK, p38a and
p38h, which are capable of phosphorylating MK2 and MK3
(18, 23, 25). PC-3 and DU-145 cells were transfected with
nontargeting siRNA, p38a siRNA, p38h siRNA, or siRNAs for
p38a and p38h together. The efficacy and specificity of the siRNAs
were determined by Western blot (Fig. 4A). Transfection of cells
with p38a siRNA or p38a and p38h siRNAs together before profen
treatment prevented an induction of p75NTR relative to untransfected cells or cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA (Fig. 4B).
Transfection with p38h siRNA alone was less effective in
preventing induction of p75NTR than transfection with p38a siRNA.
Because the p38h isoform seems to be expressed at much lower

levels than p38a, it is not surprising that knockdown of p38h alone
only modestly affected induction of p75NTR because p38a was still
present. Expression of p38a was also much greater than that of
p38h in LNCaP cells (not shown), and consistently, induction of
p75NTR by ibuprofen was prevented in LNCaP cells transfected with
p38a siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Because the MK2 and MK3 kinases are downstream of p38
MAPK and have both been shown to mediate mRNA stabilization,
we used siRNA for MK2 and MK3 to determine if they are involved
in the induction of p75NTR by R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen. PC-3 and
DU-145 cells were transfected with nontargeting siRNA, MK2
siRNA, MK3 siRNA, or siRNAs for MK2 and MK3 in combination.
The efficacy and specificity of these siRNAs were tested in PC-3 and
DU-145 cells by Western blot (Fig. 5A). Transfection with MK2
siRNA or MK3 siRNA separately before profen treatment resulted
in decreased induction of p75NTR (Fig. 5B). However, transfection
with MK2 siRNA and MK3 siRNA together, resulting in the
simultaneous knockdown of both proteins, was more effective in
preventing induction of p75NTR by R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen than

knockdown of MK2 or MK3 separately (Fig. 5B). This is consistent
with previous observations that MK2 and MK3 are activated in
parallel by p38 MAPK, have similar substrates, and are both
strongly expressed in PC-3 and DU-145 cells (Fig. 5A; refs. 23, 25).
Likewise, in LNCaP cells, simultaneous siRNA knockdown of
MK2 and MK3 was successful in preventing induction of p75NTR
expression by ibuprofen (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
p75NTR mRNA is a target of the RNA stabilizing protein HuR.
The HuR is an RNA binding protein that enhances the stability of
target mRNAs (26, 27). It has been shown that activation of the p38
MAPK pathway results in the translocation of HuR from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm where it binds to the 3¶-untranslated regions (UTR)
of various mRNAs containing a core AUUUA sequence (20, 28–31).
The p75NTR transcript contains two AUUUA sites in the 3¶-UTR,
suggesting HuR binding as a possible mechanism by which Rflurbiprofen and ibuprofen may stabilize p75NTR mRNA. RFlurbiprofen– and ibuprofen-treated cells exhibited modestly
increased levels of cytoplasmic HuR (Fig. 6A). In addition, siRNA
knockdown of HuR protein before profen treatment of PC-3 and

DU-145 cells partially prevented induction of p75NTR relative to
untransfected or nontargeting siRNA–transfected cells, suggesting
that HuR is involved in the induction of p75NTR by R-flurbiprofen
and ibuprofen (Fig. 6B). Similarly, transfection of LNCaP cells with
HuR siRNA before ibuprofen treatment was effective in preventing
increased p75NTR expression (Supplementary Fig. S2C). HuR
belongs to the embryonic lethal abnormal vision family of proteins,
which also includes HuB, HuC, and HuD, all RNA stabilizing
proteins that are typically expressed in neurons (32). Whereas HuR
expression was detected in PC-3 and DU-145 cells (Fig. 6A),
expression of the other family members could not be detected
(not shown), indicating that they most likely do not participate in
profen-mediated induction of p75NTR. A direct interaction between
the HuR protein and the p75NTR transcript was shown by an
immunoprecipitation RT-PCR assay. Lysates of profen-treated PC-3
and DU-145 cells were immunoprecipitated with, or without, an
HuR antibody and RNA was isolated from the immunoprecipitated
beads, followed by RT-PCR for p75NTR mRNA. PC-3 and DU-145 cells
treated with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen showed a direct interaction
between HuR and p75NTR mRNA, whereas DMSO control–treated
cells did not (Fig. 6C). In addition, p75NTR mRNA was not detected
in samples from cells treated with ibuprofen but not incubated with
the HuR antibody, indicating that the p75NTR mRNA detected in the
treated samples was not nonspecific (Fig. 6C).
R-Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen increase phosphorylation of
eIF4E. Although HuR seems to bind to the p75NTR transcript upon
profen treatment, the inhibition of p75NTR induction in the

presence of a substantial HuR knockdown was modest. This result
suggests that there are additional mechanisms involved in the
induction of p75NTR by the p38 MAPK pathway. eIF4E is a downstream, indirect target of p38 MAPK and is involved in several
mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation including translation
initiation through 5¶-cap binding, mRNA nuclear export, and mRNA
stability (33, 34). We examined eIF4E phosphorylation following
profen treatment in untransfected, nontargeting siRNA–transfected, and p38a siRNA–transfected PC-3 and DU-145 cells. RFlurbiprofen and ibuprofen treatment resulted in increased
phosphorylated eIF4E levels in both cell types, and the increase
was inhibited to varying degrees in the p38a siRNA–transfected
cells (Fig. 6D). These results identify eIF4E phosphorylation as
another mechanism through which the p38 MAPK pathway may
regulate p75NTR expression.

Discussion
The p75NTR exhibits tumor suppressor activity in prostate cancer
cells, which is mediated through an intracellular death domain
capable of inducing apoptosis and suppressing growth (2, 5, 7, 9).
However, p75NTR expression is progressively lost in organ confined
prostate cancer and is minimal in established metastatic prostate
cancer cell lines (10). Significantly, our recent observations that the
profens, R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen, induced reexpression of
p75NTR protein levels causal of p75NTR-dependent decreased
survival of prostate cancer cells has stimulated an investigation

increased mRNA levels. This indicated that profen treatment

influenced either the rate of mRNA degradation or the rate at

inhibitor actinomycin D revealed a strong increase in p75NTR
mRNA stability in cells treated with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen.
Previously, our investigation of the mechanism by which several
prostate cancer cell lines lose expression of p75NTR showed that
although p75NTR is actively transcribed at levels comparable to the
high-expressing A875 melanoma cell line, the prostate cancer cells
contain <1% of the p75NTR mRNA found in A875 cells (10).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

Furthermore, transfection of prostate cancer cells with full-length
p75NTR cDNA led to very modest p75NTR protein expression,
whereas transfection with p75NTR cDNA lacking most of the 3¶-UTR
resulted in high protein expression. This suggested that although
p75NTR is transcribed at a high level, prostate cancer cells have very
little mRNA or protein due to increased mRNA instability that is
mediated through the 3¶-UTR. Interestingly, the p75NTR 3¶-UTR is

f2 kb long, which is about four times the length of the average
human 3¶-UTR (35). It has been suggested that increased 3¶-UTR
length provides increased potential for posttranscriptional regulation through the 3¶-UTR (35). Therefore, it seems likely that
R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen are able to induce p75NTR expression
by modulating the stability of the transcript and that mRNA
stability is an important determinant in regulating the expression
level of p75NTR protein.
Because induction of p75NTR by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen
treatment seemed to be largely due to increased mRNA stability, we
examined activity of the p38 MAPK pathway, which is considered
an important regulator of mRNA stability (18, 21, 22). p38 MAPK
is activated by phosphorylation, and R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen
caused increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation within 5 min of
treatment. Increased activation was still noticeable 8 h following
treatment. Because pretreatment with the p38 MAPK selective
inhibitor SB202190 or siRNA knockdown of p38 MAPK before
profen treatment prevented an induction of p75NTR , it seems that
the p38 MAPK pathway was involved in regulating profenmediated induction of p75NTR. The data suggest that activation
of the p38 MAPK pathway is the primary mechanism responsible
for increased p75NTR expression. However, inhibition of p38 MAPK
did not always result in complete inhibition of p75NTR induction,
and this may be due to participation of additional pathways.
R-Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen induced activation of the kinase
MK2, which is directly downstream of p38 MAPK. MK2 and the
closely related MK3 are known to be responsible for mediating the
mRNA stabilizing effects of the p38 MAPK pathway (22, 23). They
are activated with similar kinetics, are able to compensate for one
another, have similar substrates, and lead to stabilization of the
same group of transcripts in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS;
refs. 23, 25). Not surprisingly, siRNA knockdown of MK2 and MK3
together was more effective in preventing induction of p75NTR by
R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen than knockdown of either MK2 or MK3
separately, indicating that p38 MAPK is able to induce p75NTR by
acting through both MK2 and MK3.
Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway seems to be responsible for
R-flurbiprofen– and ibuprofen-mediated induction of p75NTR in
prostate cancer cells. Significantly, there is an accumulating body of
evidence linking p38 MAPK to tumor suppression. For example,
inactivation of p38 MAPK, inactivation of the p38 MAPK activating
kinases MKK3 and MKK6, and overexpression of the p38 MAPK
phosphatase Wip1 are associated with increased tumorigenesis
(36, 37). In addition, Wip1 was found to be amplified in primary
breast tumors (36, 37). The tumor suppressor p53 is a direct
substrate of p38 MAPK and is therefore one way in which p38
MAPK exerts its tumor-suppressing effects (18, 21, 36). However,
p53 is inactivated by mutation in roughly half of all cancers (38).
This is also the case for PC-3 cells, which are p53-null, and for
DU-145 cells, which express mutated p53 (39). Here, we identify
induction of p75NTR expression as a novel mechanism by which p38
MAPK may achieve tumor suppressor activity. This may be
applicable to other cancer types in addition to prostate cancer.
For example, we previously showed that ibuprofen up-regulates
p75NTR in bladder cancer cells, which resulted in p75NTR-mediated
apoptosis (40). In addition, basic fibroblast growth factor treatment
resulted in the p38 MAPK–dependent death of Ewing’s sarcoma
family of tumor cells and was associated with induction of p75NTR
that was prevented in the presence of a p38 MAPK selective
inhibitor (41). Interestingly, p38 MAPK and p75NTR have many
overlapping roles in addition to induction of apoptosis and tumor

www.aacrjournals.org

suppression. For example, both are involved in the regulation of
inflammation as well as response to brain injury (18, 24, 42–45).
Therefore, it is possible that p38 MAPK achieves these roles, in
part, by increasing expression of p75NTR. Consistent with this
hypothesis is the observation that LPS, which leads to the
stabilization of several transcripts through the p38 MAPK/MK2
pathway, also induces p75NTR expression (23, 46, 47).
One mechanism by which the p38 MAPK pathway has been
shown to stabilize target transcripts involves the RNA binding
protein HuR (22, 29–31). HuR is the only RNA binding protein
repeatedly shown to stabilize transcripts containing the AUUUA
sequence (22, 31). Its ability to stabilize target mRNAs is linked to
its subcellular localization, and activation of p38 MAPK and MK2
has been shown to cause translocation of HuR from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm, resulting in increased mRNA stability of a number
p38 MAPK regulated genes (22, 29–31). The human p75NTR
transcript contains AUUUA sites located in the 3¶-UTR at positions
2,946 and 3,124, and these are conserved in rat and mouse,
suggesting that they may be involved in the regulation of p75NTR
expression. We showed that treatment with R-flurbiprofen or
ibuprofen resulted in the binding of HuR to the p75NTR transcript,
and a modest increase in the cytoplasmic level of HuR was
observed following profen treatment. However, siRNA knockdown
of HuR before profen treatment only partially prevented an
induction of p75NTR. These data suggest that binding of HuR to
the p75NTR transcript is not the sole mechanism responsible for
increased p75NTR expression. This is not surprising given the
elaborate picture of mRNA regulation that is emerging. Recent data
suggest that posttrascriptional regulation of gene expression occurs
through a plethora of RNA binding proteins that control the
splicing, nuclear export, stability, localization, translation, and
degradation of transcripts, often through specific sequential or
structural elements located in the untranslated regions (48, 49).
Therefore, given the exceptionally long 3¶-UTR of the p75NTR
transcript, it is probable that other RNA binding proteins regulate
expression as well, and this area requires further investigation. To
provide insight into additional mechanisms through which the p38
MAPK pathway may influence p75NTR mRNA stability, we examined
phosphorylation of eIF4E. eIF4E is phosphorylated by kinases
downstream of p38 MAPK (33). It is most well known as a 5¶-cap
binding protein involved in translation initiation. However, recent
data suggest that it regulates gene expression at several levels (34).
Interestingly, an increase in eIF4E activity is not associated with
an increase in global translation, but rather translation of only a
subset of transcripts (34). In addition, eIF4E has been shown to
control the nuclear export of a different subset of transcripts (34).
Finally, eIF4E is linked to control of mRNA stability in that removal
of the 5¶-cap is a key step in mRNA degradation, and competition
between eIF4E and decapping enzymes has been shown (50). We
show that profen treatment increases the level of phosphorylated
eIF4E, and this seems to occur, at least partially, through the p38
MAPK pathway because the increase in phosphorylation is
substantially inhibited in the presence of p38 MAPK siRNA.
Therefore, these data identify modulation of eIF4E activity as
another mechanism by which the p38 MAPK pathway may control
posttranscriptional events in response to profen treatment.
In this study, we show for the first time that R-flurbiprofen and
ibuprofen activate the p38 MAPK pathway in prostate cancer cells
and that this pathway is necessary for induction of the p75NTR
tumor suppressor by these drugs. This mechanism of induction
occurs in both androgen-independent PC-3 and DU-145 cells as

well as androgen-responsive LNCaP cells. Retrospective epidemiologic studies have shown that certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, reduce the incidence of prostate
cancer (15, 16). Numerous recent studies have provided compelling
evidence that inhibition of cancer cell growth by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can occur through COX-independent mechanisms that have yet to be fully elucidated (12, 13, 17, 40). The
enantiomer R-flurbiprofen lacks COX inhibitory activity, indicating
that the activation of p38 MAPK and subsequent induction of
p75NTR is a COX-independent mechanism by which these profens
can achieve anticancer activity in the prostate (13). Because p38
MAPK is activated within 5 min of profen treatment, it is likely that
R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen are interacting with signaling
