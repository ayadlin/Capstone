Abstract
Hypoxia is a dynamic feature of the tumor microenvironment
that contributes to drug resistance and cancer progression.
We previously showed that components of the unfolded
protein response (UPR), elicited by endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress, are also activated by hypoxia in vitro and in vivo
animal and human patient tumors. Here, we report that ER
stressors, such as thapsigargin or the clinically used proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, exhibit significantly higher cytotoxicity toward hypoxic compared with normoxic tumor cells,
which is accompanied by enhanced activation of UPR effectors
in vitro and UPR reporter activity in vivo. Treatment of cells
with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, which relieves
ER load, ameliorated this enhanced cytotoxicity, indicating
that the increased cytotoxicity is ER stress–dependent. The
mode of cell death was cell type–dependent, because DLD1
colorectal carcinoma cells exhibited enhanced apoptosis,
whereas HeLa cervical carcinoma cells activated autophagy,
blocked apoptosis, and eventually led to necrosis. Pharmacologic or genetic ablation of autophagy increased the levels of
apoptosis. These results show that hypoxic tumor cells, which
are generally more resistant to genotoxic agents, are hypersensitive to proteasome inhibitors and suggest that combining
bortezomib with therapies that target the normoxic fraction of
human tumors can lead to more effective tumor control.

Introduction
Tumor hypoxia, or fluctuating regions of low oxygen tension, is
an important feature of the tumor microenvironment that is
known to promote cancer progression, decrease response to
therapy, and predict poor overall patient survival (1). Hypoxic
tumor cells activate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)–dependent and
HIF-independent survival mechanisms that promote adaptation to
low oxygen availability (2, 3). Previous work from our laboratory
and others showed that cells respond to hypoxic stress by
phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF2a, thereby
reducing global translation rates (4–7). The eIF2a phosphorylation
at Ser51 under hypoxia is dependent upon the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) kinase PERK (4, 7) and was found to occur

independently of HIF-1a status, as HIF-1a / mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEF) exhibited similar levels of eIF2a phosphorylation
as HIF-1a+/+ MEFs (4).
This rapid and reversible inhibition of protein synthesis under
hypoxia not only leads to energy conservation, by reducing the
quantity of proteins being made that require folding within the ER
(8), but also up-regulates gene products involved in the recovery
from ER stress, such as protein chaperones and others, promoting
amino acid sufficiency and redox homeostasis (6, 9). Some of the
effects of PERK activation are mediated by activating transcription
factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor translationally up-regulated
by ER stress in an eIF2a phosphorylation–dependent manner (8).
This PERK-eIF2a-ATF4 pathway is one arm of a larger, coordinated
ER stress program, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR).
In addition to PERK, UPR signaling is mediated by two other ER
transmembrane proteins: IRE1 and ATF6. Upon ER stress, active
IRE1 processes XBP-1 mRNA, removing a 26-nucleotide intron to
generate a spliced XBP-1 mRNA encoding the functional XBP-1
transcription factor (10, 11). Together, these pathways coordinately
up-regulate transcription of UPR target genes, such as the ER
chaperone BiP/GFP78, and proteins involved in ER-associated
degradation (ERAD), which aid in restoring ER homeostasis.
However, IRE1 and another UPR target, CHOP, are also involved
in ER stress–induced apoptosis (12). Thus, the UPR, while activated
as a prosurvival response under moderate or intermittent ER stress,
can also lead to cell death under conditions of severe or chronic
stress (8).
The ERAD system shuttles misfolded proteins from the ER
lumen to the cytosol, where they become ubiquitinated and
degraded by the 26S proteasome (13). Bortezomib (PS-341;
Velcade), a highly selective and reversible inhibitor of the 26S
proteasome approved for clinical use against multiple myeloma,
is in clinical trials as a single agent or in combination with
chemotherapeutics against other solid tumor malignancies (14).
The mechanisms involved in its anticancer activity are still being
elucidated, but evidence suggests that it is in part due to the
altered degradation of key regulatory proteins, such as InB (15).
More recently, bortezomib was shown to induce ER stress–
dependent and ER-dependent apoptosis by blocking the ERAD
system, thereby promoting the accumulation of misfolded
proteins in the ER that induce proteotoxicity and cell death
(13, 16–19).
Several studies have established that the UPR is activated in
human tumors and that disruption of the UPR inhibits tumor
growth. GRP78/BiP, a major ER chaperone protein that negatively
regulates UPR activation, is up-regulated in many human tumors,
confers drug resistance, promotes angiogenesis, and correlates with
malignancy (20–22). Results from our laboratory showed that cells
with a compromised PERK-eIF2a pathway are more sensitive to

hypoxic stress in vitro and grow smaller tumors in vivo, suggesting
that this pathway is important for hypoxia tolerance in growing
tumors (9). Moreover, ATF4 levels are increased by hypoxia in a
HIF-independent manner and up-regulated near necrotic areas in
human tumors (9, 23, 24). Romero-Ramirez and colleagues showed
that the IRE1–XBP-1 pathway is also critical for surviving hypoxic
stress in vitro and, more importantly, for optimal tumor growth
in vivo (25). Whereas one attractive approach to target the UPR in
tumors is to develop inhibitors against its critical effectors (e.g.,
against PERK or IRE1), we postulated that another approach could
take advantage of its prodeath activity under extreme or prolonged
stress.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. DLD1 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells,
HeLa human cervical adenocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture
Collection, ATCC), HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and PERK MEFs
were maintained in DMEM. HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC)
were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium. All media were supplemented
with penicillin, streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and L-glutamine
(2 mmol/L). Bortezomib (Velcade; PS-341; Millennium Pharmaceuticals),
thapsigargin, staurosporine, MG132, cycloheximide, chloroquine, and
etoposide (Sigma) were dissolved in DMSO and stored at 20jC.
Hypoxia treatments. Cells were placed in an In vivo 400 Hypoxia
Workstation (Biotrace, Inc.) for the times indicated. Cells were sustained as
indicated at severe hypoxia (<0.2% O2, 5% CO2, 10% H2) or moderate
hypoxia (1% O2, 5% CO2). Oxygen concentrations were verified using the
OxyLite pO2 E-series probe (Oxford Optronix).
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as previously
described (4). Primary antibodies used are detailed in the supplementary
material.

Nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation. Isolating nuclear protein was
performed as described in the supporting information. Nuclear protein
(40–70 Ag) was analyzed by immunoblotting for ATF4, CHOP, and XBP-1.
Detecting XBP-1 splicing by reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA
was isolated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA
was generated from 2 Ag RNA using AMV-reverse transcriptase (Promega).
XBP-1 was amplified by PCR, as described in the supplementary material.
Bioluminescence experiments. HT1080 cells or PERK MEFs stably
expressing the ATF4-luciferase construct were treated as indicated, washed
with 1  PBS, and lysed (30 min, 24jC) in 400 AL 1  reporter lysis buffer
(Promega). Lysates (100 AL) were mixed with an equal volume of luciferase
substrate (Promega) and assayed using a luminometer. CB17-SCID mice
were injected SQ with 0.5 to 2  106 HT1080-CMV-luc cells on the left flank
and HT1080-ATF4-luc cells on the right flank and allowed to grow for 2 to
3 wk. Mice were then injected i.p. with vehicle or bortezomib (1 mg/kg),
and 8 h later, optical bioluminescence imaging was performed using the
IVIS-100 system (Xenogen). Mice were imaged for 1 to 4 min per acquisition
scan. Signal intensities were analyzed using Living Image software
(Xenogen). Quantification based on five untreated mice and four treated
mice in two experiments. Average tumor volume was 1,808 F 321 mm3
(HT1080-CMV-luc) and 1,311 F 293 mm3 (HT1080-ATF4-luc).
Small interfering RNA transfections. Beclin1 or nontargeting negative
control small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 50 nmol/L, Dharmacon) were
transfected into HeLa cells (1  106 per plate) using siPORT NeoFX
(Ambion). At 30 h posttransfection, the cells were treated as indicated,
harvested for immunoblots, or plated for clonogenic survival assays.
Clonogenic survival assays. Cells were plated in 6-cm diameter dishes
at three different densities (100, 300, and 1,000 per plate) and exposed to
normoxic or hypoxic conditions (0–1% O2) before treatment with vehicle
(DMSO) or different concentrations of thapsigargin, etoposide, MG132, or
bortezomib for the indicated times. For the cycloheximide experiments,
cycloheximide (1 Ag/mL) was added at the same time as the various doses
of bortezomib. Then, the drug/medium was removed, and the cells were

with a 0.4% solution of crystal violet. Colonies with >50 cells were counted.
Plating efficiencies were determined for each treatment and normalized to
controls. Error bars represent SE.
Analysis of autophagy and necrosis. Acridine orange staining and
electron microscopy for analysis of autophagy and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) detection assay and HMGB1 isolation for analysis of necrosis were
performed, as described in the supplementary material.
GFP-LC3 transfections. HeLa cells were transfected with 0.4 Ag
pcDNA3.1/GFP-LC3 plasmid using Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS reagent
(Invitrogen), and at 24 h posttransfection, cells were treated for 4 h with
DMSO, bortezomib, or chloroquine under normoxic or hypoxic conditions.
The cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1:1,000, 5 min, room
temperature), rinsed with 1  PBS, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde
(15 min, room temperature), and mounted on glass slides with hardening
gel. Images were obtained using a Nikon epifluorescence microscope at
60 magnification.

Results
Hypoxia sensitizes human tumor cells to the ER stressor
thapsigargin. Tumor hypoxia increases cellular resistance to
various chemotherapeutic agents (1).We hypothesized that hypoxic
cells would be hypersensitive to agents that induce ER stress.
To test this, we compared the cytotoxic effects of thapsigargin, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of the SERCA pump, on normoxic and

www.aacrjournals.org

hypoxic tumor cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, HeLa cells preexposed to
hypoxia (<0.2% O2) were significantly more sensitive to low doses of
thapsigargin compared with normoxic cells. In contrast, etoposide,
a genotoxic chemotherapeutic agent, was less effective in killing
tumor cells under hypoxia (Fig. 1B). The preferential sensitivity to
thapsigargin was also evident under more moderate hypoxic
conditions (1% O2; Supplementary Fig. S1A). This response was not
cell type–specific, as hypoxic HT29 colorectal cells were also more
sensitive to thapsigargin compared with their normoxic counterparts (data not shown). These results suggested that hypoxic tumor
cells are preferentially sensitive to pharmacologic ER stressors.
Hypoxic tumor cells are preferentially sensitive to the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Although a potent UPR
activator, thapsigargin has a narrow therapeutic window because
it is also highly toxic toward normal, untransformed cells (26).
Therefore, its clinical potential is limited. Conversely, the dipeptide
boronic acid proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341; Velcade),
which was shown to induce ER stress in human tumor cells, is in
clinical use (14, 16–19). Whereas Veschini and colleagues reported
that endothelial cells (human umbilical vascular endothelial cells)
are sensitive to bortezomib (27), its toxicity toward hypoxic tumor
cells has not been examined. Low nanomolar concentrations of
bortezomib induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins
under both normoxia and hypoxia, indicating that bortezomib
inhibited 26S proteasome activity to the same extent (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Similar to the results obtained with thapsigargin,

hypoxic HeLa cells were significantly more sensitive to bortezomib
compared with normoxic cells (Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Fig. S1B). A similar response was seen in DLD1 colorectal
carcinoma cells treated with bortezomib (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1B). Moreover, hypoxic DLD1 cells were also hypersensitive to another proteasome inhibitor, MG132, compared with
normoxic cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D), indicating that this
increased sensitivity was not due to nonspecific effects of
bortezomib. These results show that hypoxic tumor cells are more
sensitive to proteasome inhibition and suggest that the enhanced
cytotoxicity may be due to the overactivation of ER stress–
dependent pathways.
UPR signaling is enhanced in hypoxic tumor cells treated
with bortezomib. Although it has been reported that bortezomib
can induce the UPR in solid tumor cell lines (17–19), other studies
have shown that it compromised UPR activation in myeloma cells
(16). To assess the effect of hypoxia and bortezomib on the UPR, we
analyzed the induction of UPR targets ATF4, CHOP, and XBP-1.
Under normoxic conditions, bortezomib induced eIF2a phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Hypoxia alone induced eIF2a phosphorylation, and although this
phosphorylation was not enhanced with bortezomib, the levels of
the downstream targets ATF4 and CHOP, which accumulate in an
eIF2a phosphorylation–dependent manner, were enhanced with
the combined treatment (Fig. 2A). Thapsigargin treatment also
induced a robust accumulation of ATF4 and CHOP. A higher
concentration of thapsigargin was used compared with treatment
in the clonogenic assay experiments (Fig. 1), because the duration
of the treatments here was substantially shorter and we wanted to

12 h before treatment with DMSO or bortezomib for 24 h. Staurosporine (STS ;

avoid any toxicity by this agent. Whereas the reason for the
maximal induction of eIF2a phosphorylation by the combined
stress is unclear, it is likely due to the activation of the GADD34PP1 negative feedback loop responsible for dephosphorylating
eIF2a, which may limit further phosphorylation of eIF2a (28, 29).
To assess the activity of the IRE1-dependent UPR pathway under
these conditions, we examined XBP-1 mRNA splicing and the
accumulation of the active XBP-1 protein. Bortezomib alone led to
an accumulation of the spliced XBP-1 mRNA in a dose-dependent
manner, as detected by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR;
Supplementary Fig. S2B-C). XBP-1 mRNA splicing was induced by
hypoxia alone; however, the amount of spliced XBP-1 mRNA was
not further enhanced by the addition of bortezomib, indicating a
binary ‘‘on-off ’’ rather than a graded response to hypoxia.
The spliced mRNA encodes for the larger functional XBP-1 (XBP1376aa) transcription factor, which can be distinguished from the
nonfunctional protein (XBP-1261aa) encoded by the unprocessed
XBP-1 mRNA by their difference in electrophoretic mobilities (10).
In HeLa cells treated with bortezomib under normoxic conditions,
only at the higher doses were both forms of XBP-1 protein detected
(Fig. 2B). The accumulation of the XBP-1261aa protein in the
presence of bortezomib suggests that this form was stabilized in
the absence of a functional proteasome. Hypoxia alone induced the
expression of XBP-1376aa , which was further enhanced by
bortezomib, suggesting that all available spliced XBP-1 mRNAs
being processed are translated into active transcription factor.
Altogether, these results show that bortezomib hyperactivates both
the PERK and IRE1 arms of the UPR in hypoxic tumor cells.
Bortezomib treatment increases UPR reporter gene activity
in vitro and in vivo. We further examined the effects of

bortezomib using an ATF4-luciferase reporter in vitro and in vivo.
HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were stably transfected with a luciferase
reporter gene fused to the 5’-untranslated region of ATF4, which
confers translational up-regulation to any 5’-fused heterologous
reporter gene under conditions of ER stress in a PERK-dependent
manner (Supplementary Fig. S3). Bortezomib induced a dosedependent and time-dependent increase in ATF4-luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2C). We also tested whether bortezomib could
activate the reporter in an in vivo tumor model by using the ATF4luciferase expressing HT1080 cells to grow tumor xenografts in
nude mice. All tumors exhibited a basal level of ATF4-luciferase
reporter activity, likely reflecting activation by ER stress produced
by the tumor microenvironment. However, the tumors treated with
bortezomib showed an increase in bioluminescence after 8 hours
compared with the vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 2D), demonstrating
that bortezomib enhanced the ATF4-luciferase reporter activity
in vivo. These results suggest that bortezomib can further increase
the levels of ER stress produced by the tumor microenvironment.
Ameliorating ER stress protects hypoxic tumor cells from
bortezomib. The results, thus far, suggested that the enhanced
cytotoxicity produced by the combination of hypoxia and
bortezomib induced levels of ER stress incompatible with tumor
cell survival. Therefore, we hypothesized that amelioration of
ER protein load should reduce the cytotoxicity of the combined
treatment. We examined the effects of cycloheximide, previously
shown to decrease ER stress by reducing the overall levels of client
proteins in the ER (30), on XBP-1 mRNA splicing under the
combined treatment. Cycloheximide blocked IRE1-dependent
XBP-1 splicing in HeLa cells by both individual treatments, as well
as their combination (Fig. 3A). More importantly, cycloheximide
significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect of bortezomib in HeLa

cells (Fig. 3B). This effect was more pronounced under hypoxic
conditions, indicating the overall amount of ER stress produced by
the combination of limited oxygen availability and proteasome
inhibition led to increased lethality to tumor cells.
To further examine the role of increased ER stress in the
enhanced sensitivity of tumor cells to the combined effects of
hypoxia and bortezomib, we exposed cells lacking a functional UPR
to the combination treatment. PERK / MEFs are more sensitive
to ER stressors, including thapsigargin and hypoxia, compared with
PERK+/+ MEFs (4, 30, 31). PERK / MEFs were more sensitive to
the combination of hypoxia and bortezomib compared with MEFs
with wild-type PERK function (Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating
that the cytotoxicity of bortezomib to hypoxic cells resulted from
the high levels of ER stress generated, being incompatible with cell
survival.
Hypoxic tumor cells treated with bortezomib undergo
apoptosis and autophagy. To further investigate the mechanism
of cell death under hypoxia and bortezomib, we analyzed the
expression of apoptotic markers in DLD1 and HeLa cells. In DLD1
cells, bortezomib induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP; Fig. 4A) and processing of caspase-4 (Supplementary
Fig. S5A), which has been implicated in ER stress–induced
apoptosis (32). This activity was enhanced under hypoxia. In HeLa
cells, bortezomib induced similar processing of PARP, caspase-3,
and caspase-4. Surprisingly, the processing of PARP and caspase-3
in HeLa cells was completely abolished under severe or moderate
hypoxia (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S5B), suggesting that
preexposure to hypoxia blocked apoptosis induced by bortezomib
downstream of caspase-4 but upstream of caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage. This lack of terminal apoptosis was also supported by
the fact that bortezomib did not significantly enhance the sub-G1

control siRNA, were treated 30-h posttransfection as in B. Staurosporine (STS ; 1 Amol/L, 4 h) was used as a control. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies
specific for Beclin1, cleaved PARP, and h-actin (loading control).

population (Supplementary Fig. S5C) in hypoxic HeLa cells. These
results suggested that, although the combined effects of hypoxia
and bortezomib led to increased cell death in several tumor cell
types, the mode of cell death induced by the combined treatment
was cell type–dependent.
Previous work in yeast (33, 34) and mammalian cells (35, 36)
established that ER stress can activate autophagy, a highly
conserved lysosome-dependent mechanism for degrading intracellular constituents. It has been proposed that autophagy, as a
prosurvival mechanism under short-term nutrient deprivation,
can counteract apoptotic mechanisms and that the inhibition of
autophagy makes cells more susceptible to stress-induced apoptosis (37). Interestingly, hypoxic HeLa cells treated with bortezomib
had more and larger cytoplasmic vacuoles compared with similarly
treated normoxic HeLa cells, suggesting that autophagy was
occurring under these conditions (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The
LC3-II protein, processed from the phosphatidylethanolamine
conjugation of LC3-I, translocates to the autophagosome membrane and is used as a marker of autophagy (38). GFP-LC3
remained mostly cytoplasmic in HeLa cells treated with DMSO or
bortezomib alone, whereas it seemed more punctate in hypoxic
HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). HeLa cells treated under hypoxia with
chloroquine, an agent known to increase the lysosomal pH and
allow for LC3-II accumulation, exhibited a strong punctate pattern,
indicating that most of the GFP-LC3 was incorporated into
autophagosome membranes. A similar pattern of GFP-LC3 was
seen in the hypoxic HeLa cells treated with bortezomib. Electron
microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S6B) confirmed that the vesicles
formed in hypoxic HeLa cells treated with 20 nmol/L bortezomib
exhibited the classical double-membrane morphology characteristic of autophagosomes. To quantitate the level of autophagy under
these conditions, we analyzed the intensity of acridine orange
staining in normoxic and hypoxic HeLa cells treated with
bortezomib. Whereas bortezomib alone increased the intensity of

acridine orange staining, the levels under hypoxia were further
enhanced with bortezomib (Fig. 5B).
To test if HeLa cells activate autophagy as a survival response
under low oxygen and proteasome inhibition, we blocked
autophagy with pharmacologic and genetic ablation. HeLa cells
treated during the last 4 hours of bortezomib treatment with
chloroquine, which inhibits the progression of autophagy (39),
led to increased levels of cleaved PARP in hypoxic cells (Fig. 5C),
indicating that blocking autophagy under the combined treatment
led to enhanced apoptosis. Knockdown of Beclin1, an important
regulator of autophagy (40), by siRNA in hypoxic HeLa cells treated
with bortezomib, resulted in increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 5D).
However, overall clonogenic survival was not substantially altered
(Supplementary Fig. S6C), suggesting that hypoxic HeLa cells
activated autophagy as an adaptive response that initially blocked
bortezomib-induced apoptosis but did not ultimately prevent
cell death.
Hypoxic HeLa cells treated with bortezomib undergo
necrosis. Previous works suggested that necrosis, yet another
form of cell death, may be triggered by metabolic stress under
conditions of defective apoptosis or prolonged autophagy (37).
Therefore, we analyzed the extracellular activity of LDH and levels
of HMGB1, two markers of necrosis. LDH, a cytoplasmic enzyme,
and HMGB1, a chromatin-binding protein, are released into the
extracellular space under conditions that compromise the integrity
of the plasma membrane (41). Although there was very low
LDH activity detected in the media of HeLa cells treated with
bortezomib under normoxic conditions, it was increased in
bortezomib-treated hypoxic cells (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, bortezomib enhanced the levels of HMGB1 in the extracellular media of
hypoxic HeLa cells compared with normoxic cells (Fig. 6B),
suggesting that the increase in HeLa cell lethality induced by the
combination of bortezomib and hypoxia correlated with enhanced
necrosis.

Proteasome Inhibitors as Hypoxic Cytotoxins

Discussion
We have investigated the effects of combining ER stressors with
the physiologic stress of hypoxia on tumor cells. Although we found
that hypoxia and bortezomib individually induce ER stress by
allowing unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER, combining
these stresses together enhances UPR activity and cytototoxicity
against solid tumor cells. Importantly, reducing the protein burden
on the ER with cycloheximide alleviates not only UPR signaling
but also the cytotoxicity of either stress alone and in combination,
suggesting that the severe toxicity of hypoxia and bortezomib
combined is induced by the increased amount of ER stress
generated. Interestingly, the mechanism of clonogenic cell death is
different in the two tumor cell types tested. In DLD1 cells, the ER
stress generated by hypoxia and bortezomib induced significant
ER-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 6C, top). However, HeLa cells
responded to the combined treatment by robust activation of
autophagy, which blocked apoptosis and eventually led to necrotic
cell death (Fig. 6C, bottom). It is possible that some tumor cells,
like DLD1, either have a lower apoptotic threshold or have more
rapid kinetics of apoptosis, compared with cells like HeLa, in which
the combined treatment leads to autophagy.
Whereas several studies have now established that proteasome
inhibitors activate UPR, there are reports suggesting that they may
compromise UPR signaling. Lee and colleagues reported the
sensitivity of myeloma cells to proteasome inhibition was in part
due to disrupted IRE1-mediated signaling (16). Similarly, MG132
did not appreciably activate IRE1 or ATF6 in MEFs but led to
GCN2-dependent eIF2a phosphorylation and reduced rates of
translation (42). Our results show that solid tumor cells, treated
with bortezomib under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, upregulated the PERK and IRE-dependent arms of the UPR (Fig. 2).
These apparent differences likely reflect variations in the UPR
pathways in the cell types used (e.g., multiple myeloma versus
cervical or colorectal carcinoma) or the treatment durations and
doses of the proteasome inhibitors. In our study, we examined the
effects of bortezomib at low physiologic doses, which have been
reported to exist in the plasma of bortezomib-treated patients.
Interestingly, in agreement with the report by Lee and colleagues,
we also observed up-regulation of unspliced XBP-1 protein by
bortezomib treatment, which could inhibit spliced XBP-1 (16).
However, under hypoxic conditions, XBP-1 splicing was complete
and no accumulation of the smaller XBP-1 protein was evident,
suggesting that the combination of bortezomib and hypoxia led
to UPR overactivation.
Autophagy can provide a survival advantage for tumor cells in
regions of metabolic stress, such as in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (37, 43). Because autophagy is generally viewed as a
prosurvival mechanism and an impediment to chemotherapy, our
findings suggest that it may be possible to overcome this prosurvival
pathway induced by hypoxia and ‘‘push’’ hypoxic tumor cells into
necrosis by overactivating ER stress–dependent mechanisms. It
will be interesting to test the combined effects of bortezomib and
autophagy inhibitors like chloroquine in vivo, which we predict
will show even greater cytotoxicity toward hypoxic tumor cells.
The precise mechanism of hypoxia-induced, ER-dependent
cell death is still unknown. One potential player may be the
proapoptotic protein CHOP. In agreement with other reports
(18, 19), CHOP was induced by bortezomib, hypoxia, and the
combined treatment. However, markers of terminal apoptosis were
not detected in HeLa cells under the combination treatment, even
in the presence of CHOP, suggesting that autophagy may also be

www.aacrjournals.org

able to block the prodeath functions of CHOP. Caspase-4 is also
activated by the IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 complex, which is induced
upon ER stress (44). Indeed, others have reported that bortezomib
can induce phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH2-kinase (18), which is
also involved in proteasome inhibition–induced autophagy and
important for tumor cell survival after ER stress (36, 45). Although
our results point to enhanced ER stress–induced events in tumor
cells under the combined stresses of hypoxia and proteasome
inhibition, we cannot exclude the possibility that other non–ERdependent pathways may also be involved. For example, some of
cytotoxic effects of bortezomib toward hypoxic tumor cells could
be due to the inhibition of nuclear factor-nB via InB stabilization
(15). However, our findings that thapsigargin, an ER stressor with
a different mode of action from proteasome inhibitors, exhibits
similarly preferential cytotoxicity toward hypoxic tumor cells
supports the notion that the combined cytotoxicity occurs through
an ER stress–dependent mechanism.
A recent report by Shin and colleagues indicates that bortezomib,
despite increasing HIF-1a levels, actually inhibited HIF-1a transcriptional activity by enhancing the interaction with the factorinhibiting HIF (46). These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects
of bortezomib on angiogenesis and increased cell death may involve
the inhibition of HIF-1a activity. Although we cannot rule out a
role for HIF-1a inhibition in increasing bortezomib-induced
lethality toward hypoxic tumor cells, it is unlikely that this
mechanism plays a significant role in this response for the following
reasons. First, as mentioned earlier, UPR activation under hypoxia
was found to occur independently of HIF-1a status, as HIF-1a /
MEFs exhibited similar levels of eIF2a phosphorylation as HIF-1a+/+
MEFs (4). Second, thapsigargin, an ER stressor that does not inhibit
HIF-1a levels or activity, shows a similar synergy with hypoxia as
bortezomib. Third, it has been shown that HIF-1a plays little, if any,
role in promoting epithelial cell survival under stringent hypoxic
conditions. The fact that thapsigargin causes ER stress by a different
mechanism than bortezomib and also preferentially kills hypoxic
tumor cells argues against a HIF-mediated role in this response,
at least in the epithelial cell lines tested.
Currently, tumor hypoxia represents a significant clinical
problem. However, the reliance of hypoxic tumor cells on a
functional UPR may provide a unique therapeutic opportunity.
Indeed, the concept of hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity has received
significant attention, and one such hypoxia-selective agent,
tirapazamine, is in late-phase clinical trials (1). One approach to
target the UPR in tumors is to develop inhibitors that would
compromise UPR signaling via PERK, IRE1, or molecular
chaperones like GRP78/BiP (47, 48), and screening of small
molecule libraries is under way by several groups.4 Our findings
suggest a second approach for targeting the UPR in hypoxic tumor
cells, which relies on a clinically used agent to hyperactivate the
UPR in hypoxic cells. As only a fraction of a patient’s tumor is
hypoxic at any given time, administering low doses of an ER
stressor, such as bortezomib, is unlikely to eradicate the bulk of the
tumor and provide efficient tumor control. However, we propose
that the significance of our findings lie in the opportunity to
incorporate bortezomib with other modalities like radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, which preferentially target normoxic tumor
cells with the expectation that killing the hypoxic cells will allow
for more effective tumor control and longer overall patient survival.
