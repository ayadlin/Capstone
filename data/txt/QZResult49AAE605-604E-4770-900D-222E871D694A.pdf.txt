ABSTRACT
Treg-induced immunosuppression is now recognized as a key element in enabling
tumors to escape immune-mediated destruction. Although topical TLR7 therapies
such as imiquimod have been proved successful in the treatment of dermatological
malignancy and a number of conditions beyond the FDA-approved indications, the
mechanism behind the effect of TLR7 on effector T cell and Treg cell function in cancer
immunosurveillance is still not well understood. Here, we found that Loxoribin, one of
the TLR7 ligands, could inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models of colon cancer and
lung cancer, and these anti-tumor effects of Loxoribin were mediated by promoting
CD4+T cell proliferation and reversing Treg-mediated suppression via dendritic cells
(DCs). However, deprivation of IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody abrogated the
ability of Loxoribin-treated DCs, which reversed the Treg cell-mediated suppression.
Furthermore, adoptive transfer of Loxoribin-treated DCs inhibited the tumor growth
in vivo. Thus, this study links TLR7 signaling to the functional control of effector T
cells and Treg cells and identifies Loxoribin as a new therapeutic strategy in cancer
treatment, which may offer new opportunities to improve the outcome of cancer
immunotherapy.

Increased proportions of CD4+CD25+Treg cells
have been observed in patients with different types of
cancer; thus, how to eliminate the suppressive function
of Treg cells is a key question in cancer immunotherapy
[6, 7]. Many strategies have been explored to block the
suppressive function of Tregs in cancer patients [8, 9]. Tolllike receptors (TLRs) are pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) that participate in the regulation of
immune responses [10–12]. They are broadly expressed
in various immunocytes, especially in innate cells such as
dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages [13, 14]. Recent
studies have demonstrated that TLRs can directly or
indirectly regulate the suppressive activity of Treg cells
[10, 15]. In 2003, Chandrashekhar Pasare and Ruslan
Medzhitov first demonstrated that LPS, the ligand of
TLR4, could interact with TLR4 that was expressed on the

INTRODUCTION
Tumor-induced immunosuppression is now
recognized as a key element in enabling tumors to
escape immune-mediated destruction [1, 2]. It is now
evident that immune responses in cancer are negatively
regulated by immunosuppressive cells, mainly T
regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs) [3–5]. They are largely responsible for
inhibiting host T-cell activity against tumor associated
antigens and consequently impair the effectiveness of
anti-cancer immunotherapeutic approaches. Therefore,
approaches aiming to reduce the deleterious effects of
these immunosuppressive cells may increase the success
of various immunotherapeutic modalities in cancer
patients.

surface of DCs and subsequently activated MyD88 signal
pathway, thus releasing the suppressive function of Tregs
on conventional CD4+T cells [16–19]. Pam3Cys-SK4, the
ligand of TLR2, could directly function on Tregs, and made
the Tregs lose the suppressive function [20–22]. Recently,
Peng and his colleagues found that Poly(G), the ligand
of TLR8, could directly function on Tregs and decrease
their suppressive activity on CD4+T cells [23]. Thus, TLRs
ligands may be potential immunotherapeutic reagents to
cancer patients. Actually, imiquimod, a TLR7/TLR8 ligand,
is a widely used topical immune response modifier, which
is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
treatment for external genital warts, actinic keratoses
(AKs), and superficial basal cell carcinomas (sBCCs)
[24, 25]. By triggering cytokine production such as IFN-γ,
imiquimod enhances the ability of antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) to present viral or tumor antigens to reactive T cells
and amplifies Th1-mediated immune response [24, 26].
Because there are a number of cell types that express either
TLR7 or receptors for cytokines induced by imiquimod,
this agent has broad-reaching, direct and indirect effects
in the skin as well as the related skin immune system [24].
Thus, imiquimod has been demonstrated to be useful in
the treatment of a number of conditions beyond the FDAapproved indications [24]. However, the effect of TLR7 on
Treg cell function in cancer immunosurveillance is still not
well understood [27, 28].
In this study, we found that Loxoribin, one of the
TLR7 ligands, could inhibit tumor growth in vivo in both
colon cancer and lung cancer xenograft models, and
these antitumor effects of Loxoribin were mediated by
promoting CD4+T cell proliferation and reversing Tregmediated suppression via DCs. However, deprivation of
IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody abrogated the ability
of DCs to reverse the Treg cell-mediated suppression,
restoring CD4+CD25−T cell proliferation to near normal
levels. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of Loxoribin-treated
DCs inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, this
study links TLR7 signaling to the functional control
of Treg cells and identifies Loxoribin as a new
therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment, which may offer
new opportunities to improve the outcome of cancer
immunotherapy by administration of TLR7 agonist.

days later, when tumors were palpable, mice were then
intraperitonealy (i.p) injected with Loxoribin, which were
repeated twice a week. As shown in Figure 1A and Figure
1B, CT-26 cells and LLC cells showed progressive growth
but were inhibited by Loxoribin. After 28 days, mice
were euthanized and the tumor weights were measured.
The average weight of the CT-26-tumors or LLC-tumors
was significantly less than that of the Loxoribin-treated
counterparts (Figure 1C, P < 0.01). These results indicate
that TLR7 ligand Loxoribin inhibits tumor growth in vivo.

The anti-tumor effect of Loxoribin is elicited by
rendering CD4+CD25−T cells refractory to the
suppressive effect of Treg cells
We next investigated the mechanism behind the antitumor effect of Loxoribin. To define whether Loxoribin has
a direct tumoricidal effect on CT-26 cells, we first detected
the expression of TLR7 in CT-26 and LLC cells. No TLR7
expression was detected, using RT-PCR, in CT-26 and
LLC cells (data not shown). In a WST assay, Loxoribin
treatment did not affect CT26 and LLC cell proliferation,
indicating that the anti-tumor effect of Loxoribin is not
mediated by its direct tumoricidal activity (Figure 2A–2B).
To further determine whether Loxoribin activates innate
immune cells to induce tumor remission, we inoculated
CT-26 and LLC cells into SCID mice that have an intact
innate system but lack T or B cells. When tumors were
palpable, mice were i.p. injected with Loxoribin twice a
week. CT-26 and LLC cells grew progressively in SCID
mice, and Loxoribin treatment did not inhibit the tumor
growth (Figure 2C–2D), indicating that the antitumor
effect of Loxoribin is not elicited via its innate immune
cell activation either. To investigate whether TLR7 ligand
has an effect on the suppressive functions of Tregs, we
next purified naïve CD4+CD25−T cells, CD4+CD25+
(regulatory) T cells and DCs by magnetic-activated cell
sorting from wild type mice and tumor-bearing mice.
Then, CD4+CD25−T cells and CD4+CD25+Treg cells were
co-cultured with irradiated DCs in anti-CD3/anti-CD28
coated plate. We found that Tregs from both wild type and
tumor-bearing mice profoundly suppressed CD4+CD25−T
cell proliferation as assayed by incorporation of tritiated
thymidine (Figure 2E–2F). However, Tregs from both
Loxoribin-treated tumor-bearing mice failed to suppress
the CD4+CD25−T cell proliferation. Thus, the anti-tumor
effect of Loxoribin is elicited via rendering CD4+CD25−T
cells refractory to the suppressive effect of Treg cells.

on the T cell proliferation ex vivo. Naïve CD4+CD25−T
cells, CD4+CD25+Treg cells or DCs were first cultured
in the presence or absence of Loxoribin, respectively. As
shown in Figure 3A, Loxoribin did not directly induce
proliferation of CD4+CD25−T cells, CD4+CD25+Treg
cells or DCs. We further determined whether this effect
was dependent on the cell-cell communication, as shown
in Figure 3B, a significantly increased proliferation was
observed in CD4+CD25−T cells or CD4+CD25+Tregs
co-cultured with DCs in the presence of Loxoribin, while
addition of Loxoribin had no effect on proliferation when
CD4+CD25−T cells and CD4+CD25+Treg cells were cocultured together. These results suggest that Loxoribin
may function on DCs to promote CD4+CD25−T cell
and CD4+CD25+Treg proliferation. To verify this possi­
bility, CD4+CD25−T cells, CD4+CD25+Tregs or DCs were
purified from both wild-type and TLR7−/− mice, and
co-cultured with different combinations of either wild-type
or TLR7−/− T cell subsets in the presence of irradiated

TLR7−/− DCs. We found that deficiency of TLR7 in the
CD4+CD25−T cells or CD4+CD25+Treg cells did not affect
the promotion function of Loxoribin on the proliferation of
CD4+CD25−Tcells or CD4+CD25+Treg cells (Figure 3B).
However, when CD4+CD25−T cells or CD4+CD25+Treg
cells were combined with TLR7−/− DCs, Loxoribin had
no observable effects on cell proliferation (Figure 3B).
Collectively, these results indicate that the proliferationpromoting function of Loxoribin on CD4+CD25−T cells or
CD4+CD25+Tregs is meditated by DCs.

Ligation of TLR7 onto DCs reverses Treg cellmediated suppression
Given that ligation of TLR7 onto DCs promotes
CD4+T cell proliferation and renders these responder T cells
refractory to the suppression of Tregs, the other possibility
is that Loxoribin-treated DCs may directly reverse Tregmediated suppressive function. We therefore determined

Taken together, these results suggest that ligation of TLR7
onto DCs is important for abrogating CD4+CD25+Treg cellmediated suppression.

that expression of CD80, CD86 and MHC II in DCs were
not affected by Loxoribin (Figure 5A), which suggest that
Loxoribin does not affect the maturation of DCs. Then we
determined whether these effects needed cell-cell contact.
Loxoribin-treated DCs were co-cultured with CD4+CD25−T
cells and CD4+CD25+Tregs in a trans-well culture system.
As shown in Figure 5, Loxoribin-treated DCs reversed the
Treg cell-mediated suppression, restoring CD4+CD25−T
cell proliferation to a near-normal level, suggesting that
one or some cytokines secreted by Loxoribin-stimulated
DCs act on CD4+CD25−T cells and make them refractory

to the suppression of Treg cells. To explore which soluble
factor or factors is or are pivotal to this refractoriness, we
measured the cytokine production of Loxoribin-treated
DCs by ELISA. We found that although TNF-α and IL-10
were higher in Loxoribin-treated DCs culture supernatant,
increase of IL-6 was much dramatic (Figure 5B). We next
added IL-6 instead of Loxoribin into the culture system,
and found that the IL-6 reversed the suppressive function
of Tregs. However, neutralization of IL-6 with IL-6
neutralizing antibody abrogated the ability of DCs to reverse
suppression (Figure 5C). Therefore, IL-6 plays a critical role
in the TLR7-mediated block of suppression of Tregs by DCs.

These suggest that Loxoribin-treated DCs can impair Tregs’
suppressive function and enhance the killing ability of
CD4 /CD8 to tumor in vivo.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated that i.p
administration of the TLR7 agonist Loxoribin leads to
tumor regression in two tumor models, i.e. a colorectal
cancer model and a LLC tumor model. TLRs are
important molecules in the regulation of innate and
adaptive immunity. TLR7 agonists have been shown to
promote DCs maturation, improve T-cell priming and
activate innate immune cells such as NK and NKT cells
[25, 29–31]. However, the precise mechanism by which
Loxoribin induces the antitumor response is unclear.
Here, we found that CT-26 and LLC cells did not express
TLR7, and the Loxoribin-mediated antitumor effect did
not include a direct tumoricidal activity, nor did it activate
innate immune cells, suggesting a mechanism of action
involved in host adaptive immune responses.
Treg cells are increased in cancer and are an obstacle
for immune surveillance and immune therapy of cancer
[32, 33]. Approaches that aim to break through such an
obstacle would be beneficial to the treatment of cancer
patients, by means of eliminating CD4+CD25+Treg cells
with a specific antibody [34, 35]. However, this approach
may not efficiently eliminate Treg cells, and it depletes on
both Treg cells and activated effector cells, as the CD25
marker is positive in both Treg cells and all activated
T cells [36, 37]. Recent findings have demonstrated
that TLRs and their ligands play important roles in the
regulation of suppressive function of Tregs [38, 39]. LPS,
the ligand of TLR4, can interact with TLR4 expressed by

Loxoribin-treated DCs inhibit tumor growth
in vivo
To determine the importance of TLR7 expression
in DCs in Loxoribin-triggered antitumor immunity
in vivo, we purified CD4+CD8−T cells, CD4−CD8+T
cells and CD4+CD25+Treg cells, and mixed them with
Loxoribin-treated or non-treated DCs from wild type
mice as indicated, and then injected them into tumor cell
bearing mice. Tumor size was monitored twice a week.
As showed in Figure 6, we found that CT-26 cells (Figure
6A) and LLC cells (Figure 6B) showed progressive growth
but were inhibited when co-injected with autologous
CD4+CD8−T cells or CD4−CD8+T cells. However, when
CD4+CD25+Tregs were adoptively transferred into mice,
tumor cells again grew progressively and more rapidly
than in mice receiving CD4+CD8− or CD4−CD8+T cells
alone. In contrast, tumor growth was significantly inhibited
in mice adoptive transferred with Loxoribin-treated DCs,
compared with that in mice adoptive transferred with Tregs
and CD4+CD8− or CD4−CD8+T cells (Figure 6A–6B).

were mixed with Loxoribin-treated or non-treated DCs and then injected i.v into tumor cell transplanted mice. Tumor growth was monitored
twice a week. Data are representative of three independent experiments.

DCs and subsequently activate MyD88 signal pathway to
release the suppressive function of Tregs on conventional
CD4+T cells [38, 40, 41]. Both TLR2 ligand Pam3CysSK4 and TLR8 ligand Poly(G) can directly act on Tregs
and reverse its suppressive function on CD4+T cells [23,
42, 43]. In the present study, we show that TLR7 activation
by Loxoribin induces tumor regression in vivo, and these
anti-tumor effects are mediated by promoting CD4+T cell
proliferation and reversing Treg-mediated suppression.
The findings presented here uncover a novel mechanism
linking TLR7 signaling to the modulation of effector cells
and the Tregs’ function.
TLRs control activation of the innate and adaptive
immune responses, which is generally produced by
inducing the maturation of DCs [44, 45]. How Loxoribin
signals regulate the suppressive function of Treg cells
remains unknown. In this study, we found that Loxoribin
could promote the proliferation of CD4+T cells and made
Tregs lose the suppressive function only in the presence of
DCs. However, these effects of Loxoribin were mediated
neither by induction of DCs maturation nor by direct
cell-cell contact. Previous study has shown that TLR
stimulation, such as LPS, and CpG, induces DCs to secrete
cytokines, including IL-6, that render CD4+ effector cells
refractory to Treg cell-mediated suppression [20, 41, 46].
Bourquin et al have reported that an agonist of TLR7
may also promote antitumor T-cell responses through
the induction of multiple type-1 cytokines such as IFNα,
IFNγ and IL-12 [47, 48]. A recent report has also shown
that activation of splenic DCs by TLR7 ligand decreases
the number of Tregs, leading to a reduced and less-stable
Foxp3 expression and impaired suppressive function [49].
Foxp3 plays important role in the suppressive function of
regulatory T cells. In our study, we have tried to verify
whether the expression of Foxp3 was changed followed
by TLR7 ligand Loxoribin treatment by using Foxp3-GFP
report mice. Unfortunately, we found that Tregs cultured
with untreated DCs or Tregs cultured alone also lose some
expression of Foxp3 after 3 days in vitro culture. We are
trying to figure out why the Foxp3 is not stable in vitro,
and did not present these data in the current manuscript. In
our study, we shown that TLR7 ligand Loxoribin triggered
stronger IL-6 response in DC/T/Treg cells co-culture,
the loss of suppressive function of Treg cells caused by
Loxoribin in the co-culture system could be reproduced
by supernatants of Loxoribin-treated DCs or IL-6, but not
by supernatants of untreated or Loxoribin-treated DCs
that had been pretreated with IL-6 neutralizing antibody
against IL-6. Although other potential mechanisms that
mediate the Loxoribin-mediated anti-tumor effects cannot
be excluded, our results suggest that IL-6 produced by
Loxoribin-treated DCs in the co-culture system is largely
responsible for the reversal of Treg-mediated suppression.
Taken together, Loxoribin treatment leads to tumor
regression, and the underlying mechanism involves

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

modulation of the CD4+T cell proliferation and the
suppressive activity of Tregs via DCs in a TLR7-dependent
manner. In the light of our observation of the therapeutic
potential of Loxoribin in colon cancer and lung cancer,
TLR7 therapy may be important for human cancer, and
TLR7 ligands and their analogs could be immunotherapeutic
modalities in cancer patients in the future.

Tumour xenograft model and tumorigenicity
assay
BALB/c, C57BL/6 or SCID mice were s.c. injected
with CT-26 or LLC tumor cells. Tumor growth was
monitored twice a week, and tumor volume was assessed
by measuring tumor size with digital calipers using the
following formula: volume = ab2π/6. For treatment, 5 days
after tumor cell inoculation, mice were administered i.p
with Loxoribin (400 μg/mouse) or PBS twice a week. In
the experiment of DCs treatment, BALB/c or C57BL/6
mice were s.c. injected with CT-26 or LLC tumor cells.
Five days after tumor cell inoculation, CD4+CD8−T cells,
CD4−CD8+T cells and CD4+CD25+Tregs were mixed
with Loxoribin-treated or non-treated DCs and then i.v.
injected into tumor cell bearing mice. Tumor growth was
monitored weekly and tumor volume was assessed.
