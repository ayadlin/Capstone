ABSTRACT
Resistance to chemotherapy is a major limitation of cancer treatments with
several molecular mechanisms involved, in particular altered local drug metabolism
and detoxification process. The role of drug metabolism and clearance system has
not been satisfactorily investigated in Multiple Myeloma (MM), a malignant plasma
cell cancer for which a majority of patients escapes treatment. The expression of
350 genes encoding for uptake carriers, xenobiotic receptors, phase I and II Drug
Metabolizing Enzymes (DMEs) and efflux transporters was interrogated in MM
cells (MMCs) of newly-diagnosed patients in relation to their event free survival.
MMCs of patients with a favourable outcome have an increased expression of genes
coding for xenobiotic receptors (RXRα, LXR, CAR and FXR) and accordingly of their
gene targets, influx transporters and phase I/II DMEs. On the contrary, MMCs of
patients with unfavourable outcome displayed a global down regulation of genes
coding for xenobiotic receptors and the downstream detoxification genes but had a
high expression of genes coding for ARNT and Nrf2 pathways and ABC transporters.
Altogether, these data suggests ARNT and Nrf2 pathways could be involved in MM
primary resistance and that targeting RXRα, PXR, LXR and FXR through agonists could
open new perspectives to alleviate or reverse MM drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

advances have been made, the current treatment regimens
do not cure the majority of patients who repeatedly
relapse until they succumb to the disease [3]. Resistance
to chemotherapy is a major hurdle limiting the efficacy of
MM treatment. Anticancer drugs resistance can be innate
–primary- or acquired over time following exposure to
the drug and involves diverse molecular mechanisms,
in particular, altered local drug metabolism and
detoxification process is a major barrier that lies between

Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma
cell disease accounting for approximately 10% of
haematological malignancies, with 25,000 new patients
per year in the EU and a median survival of five years
[1]. The disease develops primarily in the bone marrow
and is associated with end organ damages including bone
lesions, renal failure and anaemia [2]. Although significant

chemotherapeutic agents and their intended curative
potential [4,5].
Drug metabolism and clearance (DMC) system is
a defense system that imports, sensors, inactivates and
excretes chemicals (xenobiotics) from a variety of sources
including dietary components, environmental pollutants
and drugs that can profoundly impair the structure and
function of cells and tissues. After drug uptake, DMC
system proceeds through enzymatic conversion of
xenobiotics into more water-soluble metabolites that
are better effluxed from the cell through membrane
transporters and discharged into urinary and biliary
systems [6,7].
Drug sensing is mediated by members of the
superfamily of nuclear receptors including Pregnane
X Receptor (PXR, NR1I2), Constitutive Androstane
Receptor (CAR, NR1I3), Liver X Receptor (LXR, NR1H3)
and the Farnesol X Receptor (FXR, NR1H4) as well as
some cytosolic ligand-activated transcription factors, i.e.,
Hepatocyte Nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), Nuclear factorerythroid 2p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Hypoxia inducing
factors (HIF1α, HIF3 α), Metal transcription factors
(MTF1, MTF2) and the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR).
Theses xenobiotic receptors coordinately regulate the
defense against nearly all xenochemicals and often share
common properties particularly broad ligand specificity
and diverse often-overlapping spectra of target genes [6,8].
After xenobiotic binding, these receptors translocate
to the nucleus and govern the tandem expression of
genes encoding for phase I and II Drug Metabolizing
Enzymes (DMEs) and transporters. Phase I DMEs consist
primarily of oxidases, reductases and dehydrogenases
that detoxify xenobiotics by introducing, modifying or
unmasking a polar functional group into xenobiotics,
respectively. Cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) are the main
Phase I DMEs detoxifying a vast number of xenobiotics,
including 80% of drugs used in clinic [9,10]. Phase II
DMEs subsequently conjugate highly polar endogenous
ligands (glutathione, sulfate, glucoronide, amino-acid,
methyl and acetyl) to phase I metabolites of xenobiotics,
giving rise to more hydrophilic compounds, which can be
excreted out of the cell. Glutathione S-transferases (GST),
UDP-glucoronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferases
(SULT) constitute the major routes of conjugation [11,12].
Both parental xenobiotics and their metabolites can finally
be exported out of the cell through xenobiotic transporters
(Phase III), which mediate translocation of chemicals into
and out of cells. Drug transporters constitute a superfamily
of specialized proteins that span cell membrane bilayers
and mediate translocation of chemicals into and out
of cells. Depending on the source of energy, these
transporters belong either to the family of ATP binding
cassette (ABC) transporters that utilizes ATP hydrolysisgenerated energy or to the subfamilies of Solute
Carriers (SLC) driven by an exchange or cotransport of
intracellular and/or extracellular ions with the substrate.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ABC transporters comprise seven families with about
20 carriers involved in drug transport and mediate only
unidirectional efflux. The SLC comprise 52 families with
many drug carriers involved in both drug uptake (Phase
0) and efflux. The role of these xenobiotic transporters
is crucial, dictating the circulating and cellular levels of
drugs and subsequently their cytotoxic/therapeutic effects
[13,14].
Unsurprisingly, DMC system has been demonstrated
to compromise the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy
and lead to treatment failure through promoting the
metabolism and the elimination of chemotherapeutic
agents. Much attention has been directed toward the role of
ABC transporters since numerous studies have established
a causative link between high expression of ABC proteins
and worse clinical outcome and refractory disease [15].
Similarly, the expression of phase I / II DMEs have also
been proved to modulate chemotherapeutic efficacy [5].
More recently, several studies have thus shown that the
activation of PXR, AhR, Nrf2, HIF1α or PPARs play a
critical role in altering the therapeutic response through
reducing active drug concentration within tumor cells
[4,16]. Meanwhile, emerging evidences suggest that
the activation of DMC system in response to cancer
drugs could also enhance chemosensitivity. As such, the
drug biotransformation through phase I DMEs does not
always yield pharmacologically inactive metabolites and
could instead produce highly active toxic metabolites
in a common process referred to as bioactivation [17].
Moreover, xenobiotic receptors functions are tissue/
context-specific manner and their activation in different
cancer settings have been reported to be pro-apoptotic,
anti-proliferative and antitumoral [18].
Despite the relevance of DMC process for the
effectiveness or failure of chemotherapy, its contribution
to MM pathology and prognosis have been poorly
investigated with much concern given to the study of
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of phase I and
II enzymes, transporters and some xenobiotic receptors
genes [19]. To this end, we have looked for the expression
of 350 genes encoding for uptake carriers, xenobiotic
receptors, phase I/II DMEs and efflux transporters in
MM cells (MMCs) of patients with newly diagnosed
MM, in relation with their clinical outcome (relapse
and survival). This study shows that MMCs of patients
with a better survival are metabolically competent and
display an increased expression of genes coding for
several xenobiotic receptors and their downstream target
genes among influx and efflux transporters and phase I/
II DMEs. On the other hand, MMCs of patients with
poor outcome exhibit global down regulation of DMC
genes but overexpressed genes coding for Nrf2 and ARNT
pathways and several members of ABC transporter family
suggesting that Nrf2 and ARNT pathways are likely to be
key players of MM primary resistance.

RESULTS

as indicated in the Methods section. DMC score ranged
from -10.79 to 15.97 in the 206 MMCs of the patients
of the HM cohort and the higher the DMC score is, the
worse the outcome is. Running an unsupervised clustering
of the 40 prognostic DMC genes along the 206 patients
ranked according to increasing DMC score, genes were
split into 2 clusters: a cluster comprising bad prognostic
genes mainly overexpressed in MMCs with the highest
DMC scores (bad prognosis) and a second cluster with
the good prognostic ones overexpressed in MMCs with
the lowest DMC scores (good prognosis). MMCs with
intermediate DMC scores variably expressed both bad and
good prognosis DMC genes (Figure 1). To delineate these
3 patient groups, a k-means clustering (3 groups, 200 runs)
was used splitting patients into a low DMC score group
comprising 43% of the patients (‑10.79 ≤ DMC score <
-0.673), an intermediate DMC score group (40% of the
patients, ‑0.673 ≤ DMC score < 4.24) and a high DMC
score group (17% of the patients, 4.24 ≤ DMC score <
15.97) (Figure 1).
As illustrated in Figure 2, patients of the HM cohort
from the 3 DMC groups had different EFS and Overall
Survival (OS). The median EFS were 12.9, 32 and 47.6
months for the high, intermediate and low DMC score
groups, respectively (P = 5.2 x 10-12) (Figure 2). The
median OS was 32.9 months for the high DMC score
group and not reached for both intermediate and low DMC
score groups (P = 9.4 x 10‑5, Figure 2).
Using the cutoff points designed with the HM cohort
(- 0.673 and 4.24), patients of the independent UAMSTT2 cohort were similarly split into high, intermediate and
low DMC score groups comprising 12.5, 34% and 53.5%

40 Drug Metabolism and Clearance genes are
prognostic to EFS in MM patients
The expression of 40 genes among a consensus list
of 350 genes coding for DMC system (Supplementary
Table S1) was found to be prognostic for Event Free
Survival (EFS) in patients of the HM cohort using a Cox
analysis. Fourteen genes were associated with a good
prognosis and 26 with a bad one. The 14 good prognostic
genes encode for 4 xenobiotic receptors (RXRα, HNF1α,
MTF1 and FXR), 4 phase I DMEs (CYP46A1, CYP1B1,
NQO2, XHD), 2 phase II DMEs (SAT1, BAAT) and 4
SLC members (SLC2A1, SLC2A3, SLC22A4, SLC22A15)
(Table 1). The 26 bad prognostic genes encode for 12
transporters (including 7 members of ABC family ABCB1, ABCB2, ABCB10, ABCD1, ABCD2, ABCE1,
ABCF3 - and 4 members of SLC family - SLC38A5,
SLC16A1, SLCO5A1 and SLC19A2), the Aryl hydrocarbon
Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT), MTF2 and Keap1the cytosolic regulator of Nrf2 (Table 2).

patients of two independent cohorts into three

OS. We looked for a differential expression of all 350
DMC genes between these groups. The intermediate
DMC group was not considered because MMCs of these
patients variably expressed both good and bad prognosis
DMC genes. Using a SAM supervised analysis (2 fold
change, FDR ≤ 0.05), 101 of the 350 DMC genes had an
increased expression in low DMC score MMCs (good
prognosis group) and only 14 in high DMC score MMCs
(bad prognosis group) (Tables 3 and 4). The 101 genes
whose expression is increased in the low DMC score
group include genes coding for 7 xenobiotic receptors,
particularly FXR (4.5-fold increase), HIF3α (4.1-fold
increase), HNF4 α (4-fold increase), CAR (3.1-fold
increase), MTF1 (2.7-fold increase). These 101 low DMC
score group genes include 30 of the known 47 CYP genes
including members of the CYP2 (CYP2B6, CYP2C9,
CYP2E1 and CYP2D6) and CYP3 families (CYP3A4,

CYP3A5 and CYP3A7), 19 genes coding for SLC members
and 11 genes for ABC transporters (Table 3). The 14 genes
whose expression is up-regulated in the high DMC score
group comprise genes coding for the ARNT transcription
factor, Keap1 the co-regulator of Nrf2, 3 ABC members
(ABCD3, ABCE1, ABCB2/TAP1), 1 SLC member
(SLC16A1) and 1 CYP450 (CYP20A1) (Table 4).
As illustrated by the supervised clustering of the
expression of these 115 genes in MMCs of patients of
the HM cohort ranked according to increasing DMC
score (Figure 4), this data emphasizes that MMCs of
the low DMC score group have higher abilities for
biotransformation and detoxification of xenobiotics
including drugs with regard to the high expression of a
majority of xenobiotic receptors and of their downstream
target genes (30% of DMC genes overexpressed)
compared to MMCs of the high DMC score group
(only 5% of DMC genes overexpressed). This is further
evidenced by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis which
reveals an enrichment of genes coding for PXR/CAR
pathways in the low DMC group and for Nrf2 pathway
in the high DMC group (data not shown). In addition, the
expression of PXR/CAR target genes was higher in low
DMC score MMCs compared to high DMC score ones
and the reverse for Nrf2 target genes (Figures 5A and 5B).

genes (variance ≥ 100) using a SAM supervised analysis
(fold change ≥ 2, FDR ≤ 0.05, 1000 permutations) in
MMCs of patients with low versus high DMC score (good
versus bad prognosis). 2026 genes had their expression
up regulated in low DMC score MMCs and 544 in high
DMC score ones. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, low
DMC score MMCs showed an enrichment for pathways of
the DMC system including LXR, PXR, FXR, Cytochrome
P450 pathways, together with an enrichment for cytokine
pathways (hyper cytokinemia, hyper chemiohinema and
atherosclerosis signaling pathways) with TREM1, STAT3,
Rel A, CREB and ILβ as upstream regulators (Figure
6A). High DMC score MMCs displayed prominently an
enrichment for DNA Replication, Damage and Repair,
Mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress response
pathways (Figure 6B). Using the C2 Kegg collection
(c2.cp.kegg.v.4.0) of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) software, two modules of gene sets were enriched
in high DMC score MMCs, the first one includes oxidative
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein
response and proteasome deregulation with ubiquitin
mediated proteolysis (Parkinson’s disease, Oxidative
Phosphorylation, Alzheimer disease, proteasome,
Huntington disease) and the second module includes DNA
repair, mismatch repair and base excision repair gene sets.
The low DMC score MMCs showed enrichment for drug
and xenobiotic metabolism, cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction, retinol and lipid metabolism and calcium
signaling pathways.

PXR, CAR, LXR and FXR activation may confer

good clinical outcome, harvested prior to any treatment,
overexpressed genes coding for several xenobiotic
receptors (LXR, CAR, FXR and RXRA), and accordingly
their downstream target genes coding for DMC actors
(phase I/II DMEs, uptake and efflux transporters). On the
contrary, MMCs of patients with bad outcome bear global
down regulation of DMC system but highly expressed
genes coding for the ARNT and Nrf2 pathways together
with several members of ABC transporters suggesting a
key role of these gene products in primary drug resistance
of MM cells.

The overexpression of genes coding for the main
actors of the DMC system in MMCs of patients with a
good outcome could appear somewhat surprising given
the well established role of DMEs and transporters to
promote the metabolism, elimination and detoxification
of chemotherapeutic drugs leading to reduced therapeutic
effectiveness and treatment failure. However, emerging
reports have demonstrated that xenobiotic receptors as
well as their transcriptional targets among DMEs and
drug carriers could confer, in a context-dependent manner,
either drug resistance or drug sensitivity.

RXRα

inhibition of clonogenic MM growth, MM tumor initiating
cells in vitro and in vivo [28].

RXRα (RXRA), − whose gene expression in
MMCs is a good prognostic marker - is the permissive
combinatory partner for PXR, CAR, LXR, and FXR
heterodimerization and nuclear translocation after ligand
binding. Its activation has been previously associated with
good prognosis in different cancers and RXRα synthetic
ligands, the rexinoids, have shown promising antitumor
activity in preclinical and clinical studies in different
cancer types [20]. In particular, bexarotene, a synthetic
rexinoid, approved by FDA was found to induce a 50%
overall inhibitory response in patients with refractory or
persistent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and to improve the
overall survival [21]. Several studies have demonstrated
that RXRA antitumor activity is attributable to enhanced
apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and increased sensitivity to
several chemotherapeutic drugs through down regulation
of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway [22,23].

SLC transporters
A possible explanation of the transcriptomic profile
with high drug metabolism and detoxification abilities
in MMCs of patients with good outcome is likely due to
the fact that high xenobiotic receptors expression trigger
upregulation of uptake transporters, the SLC members.
Indeed, in those low DMC score MMCs, the expression of
19 SLC members was up regulated, suggesting that drugs
might enter more efficiently into MMCs and induce cancer
cell death. On the contrary, in high DMC score MMCs,
the low expression of xenobiotic receptors and associated
low expression of these intake transporters could lead to
reduced drug internalization and chemotherapy inefficacy.
In particular, low DMC score MMCs highly expressed
genes coding for SLC7 family, SLC22 or SLC10, which
are crucial for drug uptake [14], [7,29]. Moreover,
SLC7A7 is a major influx transporter of melphalan [30,31],
a main drug used to treat MM patients of the HM cohort
used in this study. Previous work has shown that downregulation of SLC7A7 reduced the Melphalan uptake by
58% and toxicity by 3.5-fold in hematopoietic tumor
cells [32]. Further, Agnelli et al (2011) also reported that
a high expression of SLC7A7 gene in MMCs positively
correlated with a better prognosis [33].

PXR
PXR pathway is one of the major xenobiotic
signalling cascades enriched in MMCs of low DMC
score patients with good outcome. PXR is a major
coordinator of the detoxification process; but its role
in tumor cells is somehow controversial since PXR
functions in a tissue-specific and/or ligand-promoter
dependent manner and could play a key role in
chemoresistance or chemosensitivity. The role of PXR in
promoting chemoresistance is well documented in breast,
endometrial, prostate, ovarian colon and colorectal [16].
However, others studies have shown that PXR could
have anticancer activities, independently of its role in the
DMC system, in colon, liver and breast cancers [24,25].
As such, in addition to its master role in drug metabolism
regulation, PXR is thought to modulate cancer cell
resistance or sensitivity through the control of several
cellular processes including regulation of genes involved
in cell proliferation, metastasis, pro-apoptosis, antiapoptosis and endocrine homeostasis as well as regulation
of the oxidative stress response [18,26,27].

CYP450
The high expression of 30 out of the 47 known
CYP450 coding genes in low DMC score MMCs could be
an additional mechanism, which explains the association
of active xenobiotic/drug metabolism in MMCs to
favourable patients’ outcome. Although CYP450 generally
leads to increased elimination of drugs and subsequently
to therapeutic failure, an increase in CYP450 can also
trigger drug biotransformation, generate more cytotoxic
intermediate metabolites and have therapeutic benefit.
This is particularly true for some drugs used in the
treatment of the patients enrolled in this study, including
Cyclophosphamide and Thalidomide. Cyclophosphamide,
a nitrogen mustard alkylating prodrug, requires metabolic
activation and undergoes CYP2B6/CYP2C9 mediated
oxidation to induce DNA damage and cell death in target
cancer cells [34,35].

LXR
In addition to PXR pathway, LXR pathway is also
enriched in low DMC score MMCs. LXR, activated by
naturally occurring oxysterols, small lipophilic molecules
and xenochemicals, act as cholesterol sensors to regulate
the transcription of gene products that control intracellular
cholesterol homeostasis through biosynthesis, catabolism
and transport. The role of LXR in cancer drugs response
has not been investigated. However, recently, it have
demonstrated that activation of LXR pathway induces
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ABC transporters
Low DMC score MMCs highly expressed genes
coding for ABC transporters but these are exclusively
members of ABCA and ABCC subfamilies. Conversely,
high DMC score MMCs overexpressed genes encoding
6442

Oncotarget

for members of ABCB, ABCD, ABCDE and ABCF
families. Several studies have reported the role of some
ABC transporters in MM drug resistance, mainly that of
ABCB1/MDR1/PgP [36-38]. However, a clinical trial with
a potent and specific inhibitor to ABCB1 (Zosuquidar)
did not show any benefit in progression free or overall
survival suggesting additional transporters or mechanisms
are involved in conferring drug resistance [39]. Our data
suggest that several ABC transporters are involved in
the primary drug resistance phenotype, which could
justify at least in part the limited therapeutic success of
monotargeted therapies and imply, in accordance with
previous studies, that ABC transporter family could exhibit
a high degree of functional redundancy [40,41]. Moreover,
our data strongly suggest that in cancer drug resistant
or sensitive phenotype, more concern should be given
to the ratio of efflux (ABC transporters) versus influx
transporters (SLC transporters) rather than considering
efflux proteins solely.
Although MMCs of patients with bad outcome
display a global down regulation of DMC genes
expression, they overexpressed genes coding for ARNT or
Nrf2 pathways.

II DMEs and drug transporters. For several decades, AhR/
ARNT pathway has been studied largely because of its
critical role in immunosuppression and as major regulator
of xenobiotic-induced carcinogenesis [10]. Early studies
have demonstrated a major role for the AhR in malignant
B cell transformation including B lymphomas, leukaemia
and multiple myeloma among other cancers [45]. More
recently, increasing epidemiological and experimental
data provided substantial support that AhR presumably
activated by endogenous ligand(s) plays an important
role in tumor promotion and progression [46]. As such,
AhR was found to be over-expressed and constitutively
active in a variety of cancers and its nuclear expression
is frequently associated with bad prognosis and advanced
histological grade [47,48]. In particular, many studies
demonstrated elevated AhR levels and constitutive activity
in a variety of cancer cell lines and B lineage malignancies
including lymphomas, myelomas and T cell leukemia [45].
Microarray analysis of 1,036 human cancer cell lines
revealed a significant role of AhR in myelomas and other
B lineage cancer subtypes among other cancers [49]. In
cancer cells, AhR is though to promote cell proliferation,
cell motility and migration and oxidative stress through
cross talk with ER, NFkB, p53 and Nrf2 pathways [50,51].
Using acute myeloid leukaemia cells, recent
data pointed out increased antioxidants enzymes and
Nrf2 transcripts and elevated intracellular glutathione
concentration after ARNT up regulation [52]. Further,
it have been demonstrated that the knockdown of
ARNT in cancer cells reduced proliferation rate and the
transformation ability and enhanced cisplatin-induced
apoptosis [53].

ARNT
ARNT also designated as hypoxia-inducible factor
HIF-1β, is a major transcription factor up regulated in high
DMC score MMCs. ARNT serves as binding partner for
several bHLH members and plays a key role in two distinct
cellular signalling pathways – the AhR and HIF pathways activated in response to environment stimulations and also
largely involved in cancer cell biology. The HIF pathway
mediates cellular adaptive responses to reduced oxygen
supply. Under sufficient oxygen supply (normoxia), HIF1α
is degraded after ubiquitination; under hypoxia, HIF1α
accumulates, heterodimerizes with ARNT and translocates
to the nucleus. The HIF1α/ARNT complex mediates
the transcription of numerous target genes mediating
adaptive response to low oxygen tension. HIF signalling
has been shown to contribute to tumor progression by
promoting invasion/metastasis, metabolic alterations and
the induction of angiogenesis in numerous cancer types.
HIF1α expression has been reported in about 35% of
CD138+ cells isolated from MM patient’s samples [42].
In preclinical studies, the inhibition of HIF1α has been
shown to enhance the sensitivity to melphalan and early
down-regulation of HIF1α expression has been reported
in MM cell lines sensitive to bortezomib and lenalidomide
[42-44].
AhR, the second heterodimerization partner for
ARNT, is a chemosensor responsive signalling cascade
to a set of environmentally common immunosuppressive
chemicals. After ligand binding, AhR undergoes a
conformational change, forms a heterodimer with ARNT
and activates the transcription of a wide range of phase I/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Nrf2
The second major pathway found up regulated in
the high DMC score group with the worst prognosis is
Nrf2 signalling cascade. Nrf2 is at the crossroad between
drug metabolism and oxidative stress responses. This
was further confirmed by data from Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis and GSEA analysis underlining oxidative stress
as major component of high DMC score group signature.
In unstressed cells, Nrf2 is bound to Keap1,
ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasome. Upon
electrophilic stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1,
translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription
of genes coding for redox balancing proteins (hemeoxygenase1), phase II detoxifying genes and drug
transporters [54]. Growing evidences suggest that
a Nrf2 constitutive up-regulation is associated with
cancer development, progression and resistance to
chemotherapy [55-58]. Constitutive activation of Nrf2
is a major advantage for cancer cell for detoxification
of ROS associated with cell cycle and growth. The
oncogenes K-Ras, B-Raf, and Myc can stimulate Nrf2 gene
transcription in cancer cells, leading to a reduction in the
6443

Oncotarget

intracellular ROS level and the promotion of oncogenesis.
Interestingly, elevated activity of Nrf2 in cancer cells
has been shown to decrease their sensitivity to common
chemotherapeutic agents. This is particularly true for the
proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, a major line of MM
treatment. In vitro and in clinical studies showed high
expression of Nrf2 associated with poor responsiveness
to Bortezomib treatment [59,60]. In accordance with
other reports, our data underlined a key role of oxidative
stress in MM prognosis with the involvement with several
signalling pathways related to redox homeostasis [61-65].
The current study shows that the genes coding for
xenobiotic receptors and their downstream DMC target
genes are overexpressed in MMCs of patients with
good outcome and only those coding for ARNT or Nrf2
pathways in MMCs of patients with poor outcome. Above
all, these data suggest that selectively targeting upstream
regulators of the major PXR, FXR, LXR and Nrf2 pathways
using a subset of synthetic antagonists or agonists for
those xenobiotic receptors could provide a promising
strategy to improve the efficacy of treatment in MM. A
fine understanding of the DMC system in MM biology
will help improving the use of drugs currently used in
MM.

Identification of prognostic Drug Metabolism and
Clearance genes (DMC genes) and DMC score
building
Based on the review of literature and databases[69],
a consensus list of 350 human genes coding for xenobiotic
receptors and co-regulators (29 genes), phase I DMEs (107
genes), phase II DMEs (90 genes) and uptake and efflux
transporters (124 genes) was selected. The corresponding
Affymetrix probe sets and gene ontology description are
listed in the Supplemental Table S1. When several probe
sets were available for a same gene, the probe set with the
highest variance was chosen.
Genes whose expression in MMCs could predict for
patients’ Event Free Survival (EFS) were identified using
a univariate Cox Model. A prognostic Drug Metabolism
and Clearance score (termed DMC score) was built by
computing the mean of the standardized Affymetrix
signals of the prognostic genes weighted by their Cox
Beta Coefficient. Then patients were ranked according to
increased DMC score and split into 3 groups according to
their expression of the prognostic DMC genes in MMCs
using the k-means function.

METHODS
Patient samples and gene expression data

Data Analysis

206 patients with newly-diagnosed MM were
enrolled in the current study after written informed
consent at the University hospitals of Heidelberg
(Germany) or Montpellier (France) (HM cohort).
These patients underwent frontline induction treatment
with Dexamethasone and various drugs, high-dose
chemotherapy with 200 mg/m2 Melphalan and autologous
stem cell transplantation according or in analogy to the
GMMG-HD3-trial[66]. At relapse, various treatments
regimens were applied including Bortezomib and
immunomodulatory drugs (Thalidomide, Lenalidomide,
Pomalidomide).
Bone marrow was harvested at diagnosis, MMCs
were purified, gene expression profiling (GEP) assayed
using Affymetrix U133 2.0 plus microarrays, and data
normalized using the MAS5 Affymetrix algorithm with
a scaling factor of 500 as described previously[67]. The
.CEL and MAS5 files are deposited in the Array Express
public database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)
under accession number E-MTAB-362.
Publicly available MAS5 normalized GEP data
(GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, accession
number GSE2658) from purified MMCs of a cohort of
345 patients were also used. These patients were treated
with total therapy 2 protocol (UAMS-TT2 cohort) at the

The analyses were done with R (http://www.rproject.org/) and Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.
org/) softwares. Survival curves were plotted using
the Kaplan-Meier method. Gene expression data were
visualized using Cluster (v2.11) and Tree View (v1.6,
Eisen laboratory, Berkeley, USA). Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) software was carried out using a false
discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) with at least 5 genes for one
pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed
using the GSEA Software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/
gsea/index.jsp, Broad Institute, Cambridge, USA), and
the collections for canonical pathways (c2.cp.kegg) or
transcription factor targets (C3.tft).
