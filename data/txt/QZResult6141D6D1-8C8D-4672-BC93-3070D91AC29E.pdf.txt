Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs have been involved in the pathogenesis of different types of cancer, however their
function in pituitary tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-dependent
protein kinase (PKA)-defective pituitaries occasionally form aggressive growth-hormone (GH)producing pituitary tumors in the background of hyperplasia caused by haploinsufficiency of the
PKA’s main regulatory subunit, PRKAR1A. The molecular basis for this development remains
unknown. We have identified a 17-microRNA signature of pituitary tumors formed in the
background of hyperplasia (caused in half of the cases by PRKAR1A-mutations). We selected two
microRNAs on the basis of their functional screen analysis: inhibition of miR-26b expression and
up-regulation of miR-128 suppressed the colony formation ability and invasiveness of pituitary
tumor cells. Furthermore, we identified that miR-26b and miR-128 affected pituitary tumor cell
behavior through regulation of their direct targets, PTEN and BMI1, respectively. In addition, we
found that miR-128 through BMI1 direct binding on the PTEN promoter affected PTEN
expression levels and AKT activity in the pituitary tumor cells. Taken together, we have identified
a microRNA signature for GH-producing pituitary tumors and found that miR-26b and miR-128
regulate the activity of the PTEN-AKT pathway in these tumors. This is the first suggestion of the
possible involvement of microRNAs regulating the PTEN-AKT pathway in GH-producing
pituitary tumor formation in the context of hyperplasia or due to germline PRKAR1A defects.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non coding RNAs of 19 to 25 nucleotides that negatively
regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They target messenger RNA
(mRNA) in a sequence-specific manner, inducing translational repression or mRNA
degradation, depending on the degree of complementarity between miRNAs and 3`UTR
region of their targets (1). Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs have distinct
expression patterns among tissues and cells at different differentiation stages. Furthermore,
several studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in different processes including
differentiation metabolism cell growth and apoptosis (2), both in animals and plants.
Increasing evidence indicates that several miRNAs are directly involved in the pathogenesis
of several human cancers, including lung cancer (3), breast cancer (4), colon cancer (5),
Burkitt lymphoma (6) and thyroid cancer (7). Moreover, recent studies revealed that
deregulation of miRNAs were responsible for endocrine carcinogenesis, including
pancreatic, parathyroid and pituitary tumors (8, 9).
Most of the pituitary tumors are benign neoplasms; they account for 10%–15% of all
intracranial tumors (10). These tumors often release pituitary hormones such as the growth
hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and β-subunit
derivatives such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
and luteinizing hormone (LH). What starts the formation of these tumors remains unknown;
equally unclear is what makes these benign lesions acquire an aggressive behavior and
spread through local invasion, despite the fact that they technically remain “benign” as they
almost never develop distal metastases (11).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several deregulated miRNAs have been involved not only in pituitary cell proliferation and
apoptosis, but also in neoplastic transformation (11). Recently, Bottoni et al., showed that
miR-15a and miR-16 were expressed at lower levels in GH-and PRL-secreting pituitary
adenomas compared with normal pituitary tissue, were inversely correlated with tumor
diameter, and were directly correlated with secretion of the antineoplastic cytokine p43 (12).
In addition, miR-132, miR-128a, miR-16 and let-7 expression have been found to be downregulated in pituitary adenomas relative to normal tissues (13). Amaral et al. identified that
miR-145, miR-21, miR-141, let-7a, miR-150, miR-15a, miR-16 and miR-143 levels were
suppressed in ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors relative to normal pituitary tissues (14).
Collectively, all these data strongly suggest that miRNAs could potentially play an essential
role as central regulators of pituitary tumorigenesis and could be potentially useful as
clinical markers
We studied a relatively unique setting in pituitary tumor formation, GH-producing tumors
that develop in the setting of somatomammotroph hyperplasia. Mostly this happens in the
context cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-defective glands but not

exclusively. Patients with a germline mutation that leads to haploinsufficiency of the PKA’s
type 1A regulatory subunit, PRKAR1A, develop invariably GH-producing cell hyperplasia
(15). However, only 15% or less of these patients form an adenoma after a series of genomic
events involving chromosomal translocations, deletions and amplifications that are unusual
for benign tumors (15, 16). Consequently, these tumors like others developing in the context
of GH-producing cell hyperplasia (i.e. in McCune-Albright syndrome and in other sporadic
cases) tend to be aggressive and relatively resistant to medical therapies (17, 18). Cells from
PRKAR1A-defective tumors cultured in vitro are relatively dedifferentiated and
pluripotential, expressing both somatomammotroph features (GH and PRL) and β-subunit
and its mature derivative hormones (TSH, LH and FSH) (18, 19).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In our patients, we identified a novel microRNA-gene network regulating their tumor
formation. Specifically, we found 17 microRNAs to be differentially expressed between
their pituitary tumors and normal tissues. MicroRNA screen analysis revealed that
suppression of miR-26b, which was the top up-regulated microRNA in pituitary tumors, and
up-regulation of miR-128, which was the top down-regulated microRNA in pituitary tumors,
suppressed the colony formation ability and invasiveness of pituitary tumor cells. We
identified that miR-26b and miR-128 controlled the pituitary cell properties through
regulation of their direct targets, PTEN and BMI1, respectively. Interestingly, miR-128
through BMI1 binding on the PTEN promoter affected PTEN expression levels in pituitary
tumor cells. This is the first demonstration of the involvement of microRNAs and the PTENAKT pathway in GH-producing pituitary tumor formation in the context of hyperplasia or
due to germline PRKAR1A defects.

Results
MicroRNA signature of GH-producing pituitary tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We identified 17 microRNAs to be differentially expressed between tumors and normal
pituitary tissue (Figure 1a). Specifically, we identified 5 microRNAs (miR-26b, miR-26a,
miR-212, miR-107, miR-103) to be up-regulated and 12 microRNAs (miR-125b, miR-141,
miR-144, miR-164, miR-145, miR-143, miR-15b, miR-16, let-7b, let-7a3, miR-128) to be
down-regulated in pituitary tumors relative to normal tissues. The microRNA array data
were validated by performing microRNA real-time PCR analysis (Figure 1b). Both analyses
revealed that miR-26b (~6-fold) and miR-212 (~4-fold) were the top two up-regulated
microRNAs while let-7a3 (~6-fold) and miR-128 (~7.5-fold) were the top two downregulated microRNAs in tumors relative to control tissues, suggesting their potential role in
pituitary tumor formation
MiR-26b and miR-128 regulate the tumorigenicity and invasiveness of pituitary cells
To assess the functional role of these differentially expressed microRNAs, we tested
whether inhibition of up-regulated microRNAs or overexpression of down-regulated
microRNAs affect the tumorigenicity and invasiveness of pituitary cancer cells. Specifically,
AtT-20 pituitary cancer cells were transfected with antisense microRNAs for the five upregulated microRNAs and with microRNA mimics for the twelve down-regulated
microRNAs and tested their ability to form colonies in soft agar (Figure 2a). We found that

the inhibitors against miR-26b and miR-26a and the overexpression of miR-128 inhibited
>60% the ability of AtT-20 cells to form colonies in soft agar. In addition, we examined the
effects of the differentially expressed microRNAs on pituitary cancer cell invasiveness. We
transfected AtT-20 cells with antisense microRNAs for the five up-regulated microRNAs
and with microRNA mimics for the twelve down-regulated microRNAs for 24h and then
cells were seeded in matrigel invasion plates. After 16h (total 40h from the initiation of the
experiment), we examined the invasive ability of these transfected cells (Figure 2b). We
identified that inhibition of miR-26b and miR-26a and overexpression of miR-128 and
miR-186 suppressed >60% the invasive ability of AtT-20 cells (Figure 2c). These data
revealed that inhibition of miR-26b and overexpression of miR-128 control more efficiently
the tumorigenicity and invasiveness of AtT-20 pituitary tumor cells. Interestingly, miR-26b
is the highest up-regulated microRNA while miR-128 is the top down-regulated microRNA
in human pituitary tumors relative to normal tissues
Identification of miR-26b and miR-128 direct gene targets

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We were interested in identifying miR-26b and miR-128 down-stream direct targets.
Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the top three identified direct gene targets according
different criteria (described in materials and methods) were PTGS2, PTEN and HMGA1 for
miR-26b and MAPK14, PLK2 and BMI1 for miR-128 (Table 1). Due to the fact that
microRNAs frequently act as negative regulators of gene expression, we were interested in
identifying if there is an inverse correlation between the microRNAs and these predicted
direct gene targets. Thus, we tested the mRNA expression levels of these potential gene
targets and identified an inverse correlation between miR-26b and PTEN (down-regulated)
and between miR-128 and BMI1 (up-regulated) in our pituitary tumors (Figure 3a).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify whether miR-26b and miR-128 regulate directly PTEN and BMI1, respectively,
through binding in their 3’UTRs (Figure 3b), we performed luciferase assay. Specifically the
3’UTRs of PTEN and BMI1 were cloned under luciferase, and luciferase activity was
measured after overexpression of miR-26b and miR-128, respectively. We found that
miR-26b overexpression inhibited >60% PTEN luciferase activity while miR-128
overexpression inhibited 85% of BMI1 luciferase activity, validating the direct interactions
between miR-26b and PTEN and miR-128 and BMI1 (Figure 3c). Furthermore,
overexpression of miR-26b blocked >50% PTEN mRNA levels while miR-128
overexpression blocked >90% BMI1 mRNA levels (Figure 3d). All these data suggest that
miR-26b regulates directly PTEN expression levels while miR-128 regulates directly BMI1
expression levels in pituitary tumor cells.
MiR-26b and miR-128 control pituitary tumor formation and cell invasiveness through
regulation of their direct targets
We were interested in studying if the effects of miR-26b and miR-128 on the ability of
pituitary cells to form colonies in soft agar and to invade were mediated by PTEN and BMI1,
respectively. Inhibition of miR-26b resulted in suppression of colony growth; this
suppression was blocked when PTEN was knocked down by siRNA against PTEN (Figure
4a). In addition, inhibition of miR-128 increased the ability of pituitary cells to form
colonies in soft agar; inhibition of BMI1 by siRNA blocked this effect. We got similar data

when we tested the invasiveness of these cells in the same experimental conditions (Figure
4b), suggesting that miR-26b and miR-128 regulate the invasiveness and colony formation
of AtT-20 cells through regulation of their direct downstream targets.
MiR-26b and miR-128 regulate PTEN-AKT pathway in pituitary AtT-20 cells
We were interested in testing if there is any synergy between miR-26b and miR-128
affecting pituitary tumor formation and/or progression. We found that the combination of
inhibition of miR-26b and up-regulation of miR-128 had a more potent effect on suppressing
colony formation and invasiveness of AtT-20 cells (Figures 5a, b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Due to the fact that inhibition of miR-26b and up-regulation of miR-128 had very similar
effects on AtT-20 cells, we examined if there was a molecular link between miR-26/PTEN
and miR-128/BMI1 signaling pathways. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that BMI1 is
a transcriptional suppressor of PTEN expression levels in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (20).
Thus, we examined if BMI1 regulated the expression of PTEN in pituitary AtT-20 cells by
performing chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with an antibody against BMI1
followed by PCR analysis in the promoter region of PTEN in AtT-20 cells (Figure 5c). We
found that inhibition of miR-128 resulted in increased expression of BMI1 in AtT-20 cells.
Then, we tested PTEN mRNA levels by real-time PCR analysis. We identified that
inhibition of miR-128 resulted in suppression of PTEN mRNA levels in AtT-20 cells
(Figure 5d). The combination of inhibition of miR-128 and overexpression of miR-26b
blocked even more effectively PTEN mRNA levels. Overall, these data suggested that both
miR-128 (through BMI1 binding) and miR-26b (directly) regulated PTEN expression levels
in pituitary AtT-20 cells. It is well known that PTEN is a negative regulator of the AKT
signaling pathway in multiple cancers. We found that inhibition of miR-128 and
overexpression of miR-26b resulted in increased AKT activity (S473 phosphorylation
levels) in AtT-20 cells (Figure 5e). These data suggested that miR-128 and miR-26b
regulate PTEN-AKT pathway in pituitary cancer. To examine the role of the miR-128/
miR-26/PTEN-AKT axis in our pituitary tumors, we studied the effects of miR-128 and/or
miR-26b in the presence or absence of PTEN. We identified that suppression of PTEN
expression by siRNA, blocked the inhibitory effects on colony formation and invasiveness
of miR-26b down-regulation and miR-128 up-regulation in AtT-20 cells (Figure 5f),
suggesting that the miR-26b and miR-128 function in these cells depended on PTEN-AKT
pathway activation.
The miR-26b/miR-128/PTEN pathway in the GH-producing pituitary tumors
We finally tested in the human tumors we studied here the expression levels of the different
members of the signaling pathway that we identified above. We found an inverse correlation
between miR-26b and PTEN (r=−0.8431), miR-128 and BMI1 (r=−0.8725) and miR-128
and PTEN (r=−0.7236) (Figure 6a).
Thus, overall, in this study we have identified a novel signaling pathway (Figure 6b).
Specifically, we found that miR-26b is highly up-regulated while miR-128 is highly downregulated in GH-producing pituitary tumors developing from somatomammotroph
hyperplasia. MiR-26b increased levels suppressed directly PTEN expression while miR-128

low levels resulted in the up-regulation of its direct target BMI1. Furthermore, we identified
that BMI1 binds in the promoter area of PTEN and suppresses its expression resulting in
activation of the AKT kinase.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the past few years, several miRNAs have been implicated in various human cancers. Both
losses and gains of miRNAs function have been shown to contribute to cancer development
through different mechanisms. To characterize the microRNAome of pituitary oncogenesis,
initially we analyzed microRNA expression levels in a unique setting, that of relatively
aggressive GH-producing tumors, developing in the context of pituitary
somatomammotroph hyperplasia. We found 17 microRNAs differentially expressed, and
among them, two that ended up being involved in the same pathway controlling PTEN/AKT
signaling. MiR-26 and miR-212 were the top up-regulated miRNAs while miR-16, let-7a3
and miR-128 were the top down-regulated miRNAs in the studied pituitary tumors relative
to normal tissues. Previous studies have linked these microRNAs with the pathogenesis of
different types of cancer through regulation of key gene targets. Specifically, miR-15 and
miR-16 have been found to act as tumor suppressors through regulation of the anti-apoptotic
BCL2 (21). In addition, let-7 family members are down-regulated in different cancer types
and directly target several oncogenes such as KRAS, HMGA2 and IL-6 (22–24).
Furthermore, miR-26 suppresses tumorigenesis in c-Myc-driven B lymphoma cells (25) and
is located on chromosome 3p21.3 which is frequently deleted in small cell lung carcinomas,
renal cell carcinomas, and breast carcinomas (26). Recently, miR-212 down-regulation has
been found to be involved in lung cancer response to chemotherapy (26). Furthermore,
Incoronato et al. suggested that miR-212 acts as a tumor suppressor through direct
regulation of anti-apoptotic protein PED (27). All these data suggest that the deregulated
microRNAs in pituitary tumors are also involved in the pathogenesis of other cancer types.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Computational and molecular analyses revealed that miR-26b and miR-128 regulate the
expression levels of PTEN and BMI1. PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumor
suppressor genes in human cancers, leading to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway and increased cell survival and oncogenesis (28–30). Numerous reports suggest
that the transcriptional role of PTEN lies at a key position in a complex network of tumor
suppressor and oncogenes that regulate cellular transformation. Specifically, stress kinase
pathways such as MEKK4 and JNK promote resistance to apoptosis, suppressing PTEN
transcription activity by direct binding of NF-κB to the PTEN promoter (31). Similarly,
deregulation of BMI-1 has been found to alter cell proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and
stem cell self-renewal (32–35) and correlated with the invasive and metastatic phenotype of
several human cancer types (36–38). Furthermore, BMI-1 is a member of the Polycomb
group (PcG) family of proteins (35).The PcG proteins function within distinct multi-subunit
complexes and epigenetically regulate gene expression by altering chromatin states at
specific promoters (35, 37).
Our analysis identified that miR-128 which targets BMI1 expression also affected PTEN
expression levels. Interestingly, we found that BMI1 binds in the promoter region of PTEN,

suppressing its expression levels. Consistent with our data, a previous study has shown that
BMI1 represses PTEN by binding to the PTEN promoter locus (20).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Overall, microRNAs and transcription factors play a critical regulatory role in tumor
formation and/or progression. Like transcription factors, microRNAs are trans-acting
molecules that interact with a number of other regulatory elements. They, thus, generate a
complex grid of communications between signaling pathways (39) that are uncovered only
after studies like the one reported here. In this investigation, the unexpected involvement of
the PTEN-AKT pathway in GH-producing pituitary tumors was uncovered. These finding
should be followed by additional research and the potential use of PTEN-AKT-targeting
molecules in vivo and in vitro that may lead to new therapies for patients with aggressive
GH-producing pituitary tumors.

Seven human pituitary tumors and 5 normal pituitary tissues were collected, the latter from
unidentified human cadavers. All normal tissues were examined histologically for any
lesions prior to use in this experiment and screened negative for all genes that the 7 tumors
were screened for (see below). Tissue from all patients was collected at surgery under
research protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Eunice Kennedy
Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Tissues from
these patients and the normal control tissues have been used in our previous studies (15, 16,
18, 19, 40–42) and their histology and clinical cases have been extensively presented (15,
16, 18, 19, 42). All tumors met the criteria for GH-producing tumors surrounded by
hyperplasia (15, 18, 43) and also stained positively for both PRL and GH, which identified
them of being of the somatomammotroph lineage. All tumors with PRKAR1A mutations
displayed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the PRKAR1A locus on 17q22-24 (15, 40, 42,
44). All tumor samples were sequenced for activating mutations in the GNAS gene and were
found to be negative (40). In addition to PRKAR1A (42, 44), all peripheral DNA samples of
the patients were sequenced for the AIP, MEN1, CDKN1B, and CDKN2C genes and were
found to be negative for any coding sequence mutations (40). The case of patient #2 has
been published as a single patient report (45); he was also sequenced for PTEN mutations
with negative results. Cells from patient #5’s tumor were the ones studied in vitro previously
(19). Patients #2, #4, #6 and #7 had no PRKAR1A mutations; patients #1, #3, and #5 carried
the c.491_492delTG/p.Val164fsX4, c.693insT/p.Arg232X, and c.693insT/p.Arg232X (same
as #1, but from unrelated family) mutations, respectively. These mutations lead to nonsense
mRNA-mediated decay (NMD) of the mutant allele and, thus, in combination with the LOH
of the normal allele lead to no expression of the PRKAR1A gene in pituitary tumor tissues,
as we have demonstrated elsewhere (42, 44).

MicroRNA Real-Time PCR Analysis
We validated our results with real time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the
miRvana qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit and qRT-PCR primer sets, according to the

Colony Formation Assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AtT-20 pituitary cancer cells (purchased by ATCC) were transfected with 50nM antisense
microRNAs (as-miR-26b, as-miR-26a, miR-128, as-miR-212, as-miR-107, as-miR-103) for
the five up-regulated microRNAs and with 50nM microRNA mimics (miR-125b, miR-141,
miR-144, miR-164, miR-145, miR-143, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-186, let-7b, let-7a3,
miR-128) for the twelve down-regulated microRNAs for 48h. Then, samples in triplicate of
105 cells were mixed 4:1 (v/v) with 2.0% agarose in growth medium for a final
concentration of 0.4% agarose. The cell mixture was plated on top of a solidified layer of
0.5% agarose in growth medium. Cells were fed every 6 to 7 days with growth medium
containing 0.4% agarose. The number of colonies was counted after 20 days. The
experiment was repeated thrice and the statistical significance was calculated using
Student’s t test.
Invasion Assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AtT-20 cells were transfected with 50nM antisense microRNAs (as-miR-26b, as-miR-26a,
miR-128, as-miR-212, as-miR-107, as-miR-103) for the five up-regulated microRNAs and
with 50nM microRNA mimics (miR-125b, miR-141, miR-144, miR-164, miR145, miR-143,
miR-15b, miR-16, miR-186, let-7b, let-7a3, miR-128) for the twelve down-regulated
microRNAs for 24h. Invasion of matrigel has been conducted by using standardized
conditions with BDBioCoat growth factor reduced MATRIGEL invasion chambers
(PharMingen). Assays were conducted according to manufacturer’s protocol, by using 10%
FBS as chemoattractant. Non-invading cells on the top side of the membrane were removed
while invading cells were fixed and stained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI,
Vector Laboratories Inc.), 16h post seeding. In all assays, 10 fields per insert were scored
and SD was measured. The experiment was repeated thrice and the statistical significance
was calculated using Student’s t test.
MicroRNA Target Prediction Methods
We used three databases to detect the putative microRNA gene-targets: miRBase (http//
microrna.sanger.ac.uk), miRanda (http:/www.microrna.org) and Target scan version 4.2
(http://www.targetscan.org/index.html) databases. Then, we selected the commonly
predicted microRNA targets from the three databases and those that were conserved in other
species, aiming to the higher biological significance of our results. Studies were then
planned according to known pathway interactions per micro-RNA family (20–23).

(PTEN 3’UTR in pEZX-MT01 vector or BMI1 3’UTR in pEZX-MT01 vector) (200 ng) and
1 ng of the pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase construct (for normalization) were co-transfected
per well. Cell extracts were prepared 24h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was
measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI, USA).

ELISA assay for AKT S473 phosphorylation status
AtT-20 cells were treated with 50nm of miR-NC, as-miR-NC, as-miR-128 and/or miR-26b
for 48h, the cells were lysed and AKT S473 phosphorylation status was measured by an
ELISA immunoassay kit (cat no. KCB887, R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis
A two-sample t test was done for experiments described above. Experiments were done at
least in triplicate, and a mean was calculated. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
