ABSTRACT
Purpose: Preclinical tumor models show that chemotherapy has immune
modulatory properties which can be exploited in the context of immunotherapy.
The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and immunogenicity
of combinations of such an immunomodulatory chemotherapeutic agent with
immunotherapy, p53 synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine and Pegintron (IFN-α) in
patients with platinum-resistant p53-positive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
Experimental design: This is a phase 1/2 trial in which patients sequential 6 cycles
of gemcitabine (1000 mg/kg2 iv; n = 3), gemcitabine with Pegintron before and after the
first gemcitabine cycle (Pegintron 1 μg/kg sc; n = 6), and gemcitabine and Pegintron
combined with p53 SLP vaccine (0.3 mg/peptide, 9 peptides; n = 6). At baseline, 22
days after the 2nd and 6th cycle, blood was collected for immunomonitoring. Toxicity,
CA-125, and radiologic response were evaluated after 3 and 6 cycles of chemotherapy.
Results: None of the patients enrolled experienced dose-limiting toxicity. Predominant
grade 3/4 toxicities were nausea/vomiting and dyspnea. Grade 1/2 toxicities consisted
of fatigue (78%) and Pegintron-related flu-like symptoms (72%). Gemcitabine reduced
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (p = 0.0005) and increased immune-supportive M1
macrophages (p = 0.04). Combination of gemcitabine and Pegintron stimulated higher
frequencies of circulating proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells but not regulatory T-cells.
All vaccinated patients showed strong vaccine-induced p53-specific T-cell responses.
Conclusion: Combination of gemcitabine, the immune modulator Pegintron and
therapeutic peptide vaccination is a viable approach in the development of combined
chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens to treat cancer.

INTRODUCTION

responses, but did not improve clinical responses [23].
In colorectal cancer patients the combination of this p53
SLP vaccine with IFN-α on the injection site resulted in
enhanced inflammation as well as stronger and better
type 1 cytokine polarized p53-specific CD4+ and CD8+
T-cell responses [24]. IFN-α is known to induce the
full maturation of dendritic cells, to improve crosspresentation of tumor antigens and to enhance survival
of activated T-cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor
response [25–30]. In preclinical mouse experiments, no
tolerance of CD4+ T-cells to wt p53 was demonstrable
[31, 32] and such CD4+ T-cells enhanced the anti-tumor
effect of tumor-specific CD8+ T-cells [31].
Here, we studied the feasibility and
immunogenicity to treat patients with platinum-resistant
p53-positive ovarian cancer using combinatorial
regimens in which p53 SLP vaccination and Pegintron
(IFN-α) were administrated before and after the
first cycle of gemcitabine. Analysis of the effect of
these compounds on the patient’s immune system
revealed a reduction in MDSC, an increase in both M1
macrophages and activated T-cells, as well as a strong
reactivity against the p53 SLP vaccine.

Ovarian cancer has a dismal prognosis, with a
5-years survival of 30% [1, 2]. These cancer patients
are treated with platinum-based chemotherapy but the
majority develops recurrences and ultimately die because
of treatment failure, indicating that other treatment
strategies are warranted. Cancer immunotherapy has been
shown to be an effective treatment modality in metastatic
cancer, however, clinical efficacy is often delayed and
only observed in a part of the treated cancer patients [3],
including those with ovarian cancer [4, 5]. Epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC) is likely to benefit from T-cell-based
immunotherapy as it was observed that strong infiltration
with CD8+ T-cells is correlated with enhanced survival
and response to chemotherapy [6, 7]. Unfortunately, the
EOC microenvironment is known to restrain the cytotoxic
activity of effector lymphocytes in a direct fashion [8, 9]
as well as indirectly by favoring the accumulation of
regulatory T-cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSC) and M2 macrophages [10–12], associated
with suppression of tumor immunity and treatment failures
[13]. The path to clinical success in patients with EOC
thus requires a strategy that increases the frequency and
activity of antitumor T-cells while eliminating suppressive
immune cells and providing enough time for a fully
developed antitumor response, hence treatment should
start as early as possible.
In the last decade, platinum-resistant EOC patients
are often treated with gemcitabine as it has single agent
activity and a favorable safety profile [14]. Interestingly,
gemcitabine not only has direct anti-tumor effects but
has also been shown to eliminate MDSCs and Tregs
in preclinical tumor models [15–18]. In addition, we
showed that gemcitabine delayed tumor growth and
synergized with therapeutic vaccination for the eradication
of established tumors in a murine tumor model [19].
Altogether, in preclinical studies gemcitabine could
not only be successfully combined with therapeutic
vaccination but it also deleted two types of immune
suppressive cells playing a role in EOC.
Based on these preclinical data we hypothesized
whether it was possible to combine gemcitabine with
therapeutic vaccination and interferon alpha (IFN-α)
in patients. In this study, we chose to use the p53
Synthetic Long Peptide vaccine (P53 SLP) to strengthen
the tumor-specific immune response [20]. The p53
protein is overexpressed in about half of the ovarian
cancer patients and known to activate spontaneous
T-cell responses in these patients [21]. Previously,
administration of the p53 SLP vaccine in patients
with ovarian cancer was feasible, safe and showed to
induce p53-specific T-cell responses [22]. Treatment
with a low dose of cyclophosphamide to temporary
decrease the number of Tregs, given before p53 SLP
vaccination further increased the p53-specific immune

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study
if they were at least 18 years of age, had platinumresistant ovarian cancer with immunohistochemically
confirmed ‘mutant’ p53-expression pattern, defined as
a strong nuclear staining in more than 75% of the tumor
cells, had measurable disease (RECIST 1.1) or elevated
CA-125 > 2 times the upper limit. Patients also had to
have a WHO performance score of 0–2 and adequate
bone marrow function (WBC ≥3.0 × 109/L, neutrophils
≥ 1.5 × 109/L, platelets ≥100 × 109/L), liver function
(bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (UNL) range,
ALAT and/or ASAT ≤2.5 × UNL, Alkaline Phosphatase
≤5 × UNL) and renal function (calculated creatinine
clearance ≥50 mL/min). Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients. Patients were excluded
from the study when they had a malignancy within
the previous 5 years (with exception of a history of a
previous basal cell carcinoma of the skin or pre-invasive
carcinoma of the cervix), serious other diseases, known
hypersensitivity to any of the components of the
treatment, were pregnant or lactating or had any medical
or psychological condition which in the opinion of the
investigator would not permit the patient to complete
the study or sign meaningful informed consent. The
study was ethically approved by the Central Committee
on Research Involving Human Subjects in The Hague,
The Netherlands (NL34041.000.10) and registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NTC01639885).

Study objectives

Treatment schedule

Primary objective was to determine the feasibility
and immunogenicity of the combination of gemcitabine
and interferon alpha-2b with or without p53 SLP. To
assess the primary endpoint of feasibility, the incidence
and severity of all adverse events, vital parameters and
changes in blood chemistry and hematology parameters
were determined. Toxicity was measured using the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03
(CTCAEv4.03). Relationship to treatment was evaluated
for all adverse events. At each visit, patients were
assessed by physical examination, vital signs, toxicity
and complete blood count with differential and serum
biochemistry. The immunogenicity was determined
by assessment of the induction of p53-specific T-cells
following treatment. Secondary endpoints were
assessment of the effect of chemo-immunotherapy
on the immune system and the relationship between
anti-tumor immunity and clinical outcome. The effect
on the immune system was measured by an array
of immunologic assays as described below (see:
immunomonitoring). Tumor response to treatment was
evaluated according to gynecological cancer intergroup
(GCIG) criteria [33] by combining serum CA-125 levels
obtained at every visit with computerized tomography
(CT) performed within three weeks after third and sixth
cycle of chemotherapy and evaluated according to
RECIST criteria 1.1 [34].

This was an open-label, multi-center, sequential
trial. All patients received standard chemotherapy, 6
cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 iv (d1, 8, 15; every
4 weeks). Patients were sequentially treated in three
groups: the first three patients received gemcitabine
alone, the following six patients received gemcitabine and
IFN-α 2b s.c. (Pegintron 1 μg/kg, Schering-Plough, The
Netherlands) 7 days prior and 22 days after to the first
infusion of gemcitabine . The last cohort of six patients
received gemcitabine, Pegintron and additionally p53 SLP
vaccine (0.3 mg.peptide) in the same treatment schedule
(Figure 1). The Pegintron as well as the vaccination were
injected in the upper arm; Pegintron was injected within 10
centimeters proximity to the vaccination site. At baseline,
day 22 of second cycle gemcitabine and at the end of
the study, blood was drawn for immune-monitoring. To
evaluate the impact of treatment on the immune system
at least 5 evaluable patients (defined by a blood sample
taken before and after treatment) were required in every
intervention group.

Vaccine
The p53 SLP vaccine consisted of 9 synthetic
25–30 amino acids long overlapping peptides, spanning
amino acids 70–235 of the wt-p53 protein. Peptides
were prepared at the GMP facility of the Department

Figure 1: Study scheme. This study consisted of three treatment groups: 1. 3 patients receiving only gemcitabine; 2. 6 patients receiving

gemcitabine and Pegintron; 3. 6 patients receiving gemcitabine, Pegintron and p53 SLP. Before, after 2 cycles and after the last cycle, blood
was drawn for immunomonitoring. Tumor assessment was performed at baseline, after 3 and after 6 cycles. *Pegintron was given 7 days
prior to the first dose of gemcitabine and day 22 (Group 2). **The combination Pegintron and p53 SLP® 7 days prior to the first dose of

of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology at the LUMC. At
the day of immunization the peptides (0.3 mg/peptide)
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final
concentration 20%) admixed with 20 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.5) and emulsified with an equal volume of
Montanide ISA-51 (Seppic). At the day of vaccination, the
vaccine was prepared as previously described [24]. The
vaccine (2.7 mL) was administered subcutaneously in the
upper arm.

The plates were read by automated ELISPOT reader
(BioSys, Karben, Germany) according to guidelines as
published [36]. Specific spots (mean number of spots in
the test wells minus the mean number of spots plus 2x
standard deviation (STD) in medium only control wells)
of at least 1 in 10,000 PBMCs is considered a positive
antigen-specific T-cell response. A vaccine-induced
response was defined as at least a 3-fold increase in
response after vaccination compared with the baseline
sample.

Expression of p53

Analysis of lymphocyte proliferation assay

The expression of p53 by ovarian tumor cells was
determined in the available paraffin-embedded metastatic
tissue of the vaccinated patients by standard two-step
indirect immunohistochemical staining as described
previously [20]. Strong nuclear expression of p53 in ≥75%
of the tumor cells was considered positive.

The proliferative capacity of T-cells to mitogenic
stimulation was analyzed as described previously [20].
The mean plus 3x STD of 4 medium control wells was
used as cut-off value. The stimulation index (SI) was
calculated by dividing the mean of test wells by that
of the control wells. A positive response was defined
as SI ≥ 3.

Immunomonitoring

Antigen presenting cell capacity

We acknowledge the concept of the Minimal
Information About T-cell Assays (MIATA) reporting
framework for human T-cell assays [35].

PBMCs were tested in a mixed lymphocyte reaction
(MLR) to evaluate the antigen presenting capacity as
described before [24].

Cell samples

Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry

Venous blood (80 cmL) samples were drawn prior
to vaccination, three weeks after the second chemotherapy
cycle and at the end of study (three weeks after the
sixth cycle of chemotherapy or if previously stopped
at end of study). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) and blood serum were isolated and stored as
described previously [24]. To compare patient’s immune
characteristics with healthy donors, blood of six agematched healthy donors was collected, processed and
stored identically.

The immune cell composition of PBMCs was
analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously [37].
Gating strategies are shown in Supplementary Figure S1.
In short, a million cells were spin down and afterwards,
1mL lysisbuffer was added for 1 minute. After addition
of 9 mL IMDM + 10% fetal cow serum (FCS), cells were
centrifuged and staining was performed in PBS/0·5%
BSA. Fc-receptor was blocked 10 minutes on ice by
adding 50 μl PBS/0·5% BSA/10% FCS. Cells were
incubated for 30 minutes with a mixture of the following
antibodies: CD1a (FITC, clone HI149 – BD, Breda,
The Netherlands), CD3 (Pacific Blue, clone UCHT1

Enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay
PBMCs prior to and post vaccination were thawed
at the same time and subjected to the assay as described
previously [24]. Briefly, a set of six pools of long
overlapping peptides, indicated by the first and last amino
acid in the p53 protein, was used for the screening of T-cell
responses: p53.1: 1–78; p53.2: 70–115; p53.3: 102–155;
p53.4: 142–203; p53.5: 190–248; and p53.6: 241–393.
Peptide pools p53.2 to p53.5 represented the sequence
in the p53 protein included in the vaccine, whereas the
other two peptide pools p53.1 and p53.6 represented the
remaining and flanking parts of p53. As a positive control,
recall antigen mixture, the memory response mix (MRM),
was taken along. Memory Response Mix (MRM; stock
4 ×), consisting of tetanus toxoid (0.06 LF/mL; National
Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven,
The Netherlands), mycobacterium tuberculosis sonicate

for Windows; SPSS, Inc). The Mann-Whitney test and
the Fisher’s exact test were used to evaluate differences
in patient characteristics at different time points. The
relationship between anti-tumor immunity and clinical
outcome was determined using t-test and correlation tests
(Pearson/Spearman). Survival curves were calculated
using Kaplan-Meier method. Because this is a dosefinding, hypothesizing generating study, the data is not
corrected for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Eighteen patients (median age 61 years, range
51–69) were enrolled between January 2010 and
March 2013 in two Dutch hospitals (Leiden University
medical Center (LUMC) and University Medical
Center Groningen (UMCG). Patient characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The mean time from diagnosis until
inclusion was 31.4 months with a median of 2 (range
1–5) previous chemotherapy lines. Five patients ended
the study before the second blood acquisition was
achieved due to progression of disease. To determine
the impact of treatment on the immune system in every
therapy group, three more patients (C16, C17 and
C18) were enrolled in the second group (gemcitabine
+ Pegintron). One patient (C08) received only one
injection of Pegintron because of adverse events (flulike symptoms grade 2) and one patient (C12) received
only one vaccination and Pegintron injection, due to
adverse events (redness of arm >10 cm and flu-like
symptoms grade 2; Table 2).

Determination of cytokines
IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-12p70 Inflammatory
cytometric bead array (CBA, BD Biosciences) was used to
determine cytokines and concentration (in pg/mL) present
in supernatant of above described assays according to the
manufacturer’s instructions [32].
Laboratory environment
The immunomonitoring assays were performed in
the laboratory of the department of Medical Oncology
(LUMC) that operates under research conditions,
externally and internally audited with respect to
immunomonitoring, following SOPs, with pre-established
definitions of positive responses and using trained staff.
This laboratory has participated in all proficiency panels
of the CIMT Immunoguiding Program (CIP; of which
SHvdB and MW are steering committee members; http://
www.cimt.eu/workgroups/cip/) to validate its SOPs as
well as many of the proficiency panels of the USA-based
Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium (CIC of the Cancer
Research Institute).

Safety and tolerability
Adverse events
All adverse events are depicted in Table 2A. Nine
patients (50%) showed grade 3 or 4 adverse events
(Table 2A). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events
were nausea/vomiting (22%) and dyspnea (17%). Four
patients were admitted to the hospital because of severe
nausea and vomiting. One patient had severe abdominal
pain (unknown cause) which resolved spontaneously.
Three patients had severe dyspnea due to their disease
of which one had progressive disease and two could
continue treatment after drainage of pleural fluid. The
non-neutropenia fever was due to a nephrodrain induced
Klebsiella pneumonia. No significant changes between the
different treatment groups were found. One patient of the
control group presented with a severe hypokalemia; in the
group of gemcitabine combined with Pegintron one patient
suffered from a grade 3 hyperkalemia.
The majority of patients experienced fatigue during
treatment (78%), flu-like symptoms (72%) and nausea/

Statistical analysis
Based on our previous studies [20, 22], a sample
size of six patients in each intervention group was
sufficient to measure p53-specific reactions and the
effect on Pegintron. No further power calculation was
performed, since this was an exploratory study. For each
individual immune-modulatory assay, a positive response
is predefined per assay and described previously.
Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS (version 20

hours after injection of Pegintron in 12 of 13 patients.
All other systemic adverse events occurring in > 15%
of all patients are summarized in Table 2A and did not
significantly differ between the treatment groups. All
patients who received the p53 SLP vaccine developed
grade 1–2 local skin reactions with redness and induration
at the injection sites (Table 2B). This toxicity was
long-lasting because 82% of the vaccination sites still
were swollen and red (grade 1–2; Example shown in
Supplementary Figure S2) after 2 months.

at baseline when compared to healthy donors but not
affected by the treatment. Figure 2 shows the effect on all
patients; Figure 3 shows the effect divided per treatment
group. To get more insight in the effect of treatment on
different subsets of the myeloid cell compartment, we
analyzed the different subsets of MDSCs (HLA-DRmyeloid cells) and macrophages (HLA-DR+ myeloid
cells). A classification of myeloid cell types based on our
gating strategy (Supplementary Figure S1b) is shown in
Supplementary Figure S3. Interestingly, the percentage
of total HLA-DR + myeloid cells was increased upon
treatment (p = 0.04; Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure S4),
reflected by increases in CD11b+CD14+CD11c+CD163−
CD16−CD206− macrophages (macrophage type 6;
potentially M1 macrophages; p = 0.04), but not of
CD11b+CD14+CD11c+CD163+CD16−CD206− macro
phages (macrophage type 8; suppressive M2-like
macrophages; Figure 2E, 2F, Supplementary Figure
S4). Concomitantly, an explicit decline in HLA-DRmyeloid cells (p = 0.0003) was observed (Figure 2G, 2H,
Supplementary Figure S4), in particular that of CD14−
CD15−CD11b+CD33−CD34−CD124− (MDSC type 36;
MDSC definition 10; p = 0.0005) in all treatment groups.
The observed changes were found in all treatment groups
(Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that these
effects are gemcitabine mediated.

Clinical outcome
A median of three gemcitabine cycles
was administered (range 1 to 6). Fourteen patients did not
complete all 6 chemotherapy cycles due to prog­ression
of disease. Based on CT-scan, a partial response (PR)
was observed in two patients, stable disease (SD) in four
patients and progressive disease (PD) in 10 patients. Two
patients did not have a second CT-scan due to clinical PD.
Outcome established by CA-125 levels resulted in one
complete remission, three PR, two SD and six patients
with PD. In five patients, CA-125 was not available, in
one patient CA-125 was not evaluable.

Immunogenicity
Gemcitabine reduces MDSCs and increases M1, but
not M2 macrophages

Gemcitabine/Pegintron/p53 SLP treatment induces
profound T-cell activation and increases in Activated
T-cell/regulatory T cell ratios

In order to investigate the immunological effects of
this triple treatment regimen, we studied the changes in
phenotype of different immune cells. Although patients
displayed lower frequencies of total number of T-cells and
higher frequencies of CD25posCD127lowFoxP3pos Tregs at
baseline compared to healthy subjects, no changes in the
frequencies of B cells, T-cells and Tregs were observed in
response to the treatment. The total frequency of myeloid
cells, defined by CD45+CD3-CD19- cells, was higher

In addition, the effect of treatment on the
activation status of T-cells was studied. No changes
in expression of CTLA-4 and CD45RA expression
were observed in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and Tregs
following treatment (not shown). Ki67 expression was
detected in CD4+ Tregs, CD4+ non-Tregs and CD8+
T-cells, with Tregs displaying the highest percentages.
Upon treatment Ki67 expression was significantly

Pegintron treatment group, two patients displayed
a modest response after 2 cycles of treatment. P53specific T-cell responses were detectable in all p53 SLP
vaccinated patients after treatment (p = 0.03; Figure 6A,
Supplementary Figure S6). The general T-cell response,
i.e. the recall response to influenza virus M1 peptides as
well as to a mix of bacterial antigens (MRM), showed a
non-significant increase in reactivity in patients treated
with gemcitabine and Pegintron, irrespective of p53
vaccination (Figure 6B). Interestingly, the magnitude of
the swelling of the injection site was correlated with more

and TNF-α rather than IL-4 or IL-5 (Supplementary
Figure S7B). Neither the amount of cytokines produced
nor the balance between the cytokines changed
during treatment. In addition, there were no changes
in the capacity of circulating antigen presenting
cells to stimulate allogeneic lymphocyte reactions
(Supplementary Figure S7C).

DISCUSSION
Patients with platinum-resistant p53-positive ovarian
cancer were treated with gemcitabine, gemcitabine with
Pegintron, or a combination of gemcitabine, Pegintron
and p53 SLP vaccine. The combination treatments were
safe, feasible and had immune stimulatory effects. Our
results show that gemcitabine treatment resulted in a
reduction of immune-suppressive MDSCs and an increase
in immune-stimulating M1 macrophages. Furthermore,
the combination of gemcitabine and Pegintron stimulated
higher frequencies of circulating proliferating T-cells but

Cytokine production and antigen presentation does not
change upon treatment
The capacity of T-cells to proliferate upon
antigenic stimulation was analyzed before and after
treatment (Supplementary Figure S7A). Based on the
amounts of cytokines secreted, the patients displayed a

not Tregs. Moreover, all vaccinated patients showed a
strong vaccine-induced p53-specific T-cell response.
We observed eleven grade 3/4 adverse events, most
likely due to chemotherapy and/or Pegintron. To address
the role of the combination of gemcitabine with Pegintron
in bone marrow depletion would have required a group
of patients treated with chemotherapy and vaccination
only but such a group was not included because of the
beneficial immunological effects of Pegintron on the
T-cell response induced by the p53 SLP vaccine [24].
Pegintron-specific adverse events were flu-like symptoms
reported within 24 hours after administration, but all were
well manageable. Specific adverse events caused by the
vaccine treatment were local redness and induration at
the injection site which did not exceed grade 2 reactions.
The observed skin reactions are in accordance with our
previous study in which Pegintron was combined with the
p53 SLP vaccine [24], and probably the result of a strong
IFN-α potentiated (18–20, 27–29) immune response to
the vaccine. This notion is strengthened by the explicit
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

correlation between the size of the injection site (Figure
4D) and the response measured by ELISPOT (Figure 4A),
as well as the presence of circulating Ki67+ T-cells in
patients treated with gemcitabine and Pegintron (Figure 3).
Several mouse studies showed that gemcitabine
is able to eliminate MDSCs and Tregs [15–18]. We are
the first to show in humans that gemcitabine treatment
decreases MDSC, in particular the CD11b+, HLADRlow (MDSC 10) population in humans (p = 0.0005).
In addition, we showed that gemcitabine treatment
resulted in an increase in M1 macrophages (p = 0.04) but
importantly not in immune-suppressive M2 macrophages.
Previously, it was shown that the population of circulating
CD4+ Tregs displayed a higher proportion of ki67+ cells
than non-Treg CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells [18]. Our
study shows similar data on ki67 expression by T-cells.
Of note, the small population study size makes the
interpretation of the immunological data prone to false
positive findings but it is encouraging to see that our data
confirms the earlier findings in mouse models and patients

ELISPOT (p = 0.02), measured by linear regression (r = 0.87).

Furthermore, it was shown that gemcitabine treatment
depleted the majority of the Ki67+ cells, when measured
1–2 days after treatment, thereby disproportionally
affecting Tregs [18]. We analyzed blood samples 7–14
days after gemcitabine treatment and although we did
not observe a decrease in the frequency of Ki67 + T-cells
at that time point, a significant increase in Ki67+ CD4+
and CD8+ T-cells was detected, which was not mirrored
by the CD4 + Treg population. This resulted in increased
Ki67 + T-cell over Ki67+ Treg ratio’s, sustaining the
notion that gemcitabine may affect Tregs more than other
T-cells in humans even after the immediate effect of the
drug has worn off.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Previous studies have shown that p53 SLP vaccination
induced p53-specific T-cell responses in ovarian cancer
patients [22] and that the combination with Pegintron
resulted in stronger immune responses [24]. Here, the
combination of Pegintron and p53 SLP resulted in a strong
immune response reflected by the local vaccine site reactions
and the T-cell response against the vaccine peptides as
measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Compared to previous
studies, concurrent administration of at least two cycles of
gemcitabine does not affect p53-specific T-cell reactivity.
Potentially this is also true for 6 cycles of gemcitabine but
the number of patients tested at that point was too low for
firm conclusions. It is important to emphasize that in the
32240

Oncotarget

current study, there is no separate group combining p53 SLP
vaccination with chemotherapy alone to study the influence
of Pegintron on the p53-specific reactivity.
The combination of gemcitabine and IFN-α was
shown to act synergistically in inhibiting tumor cell
proliferation in a mouse model for pancreatic cancer
[38, 39]. In a dose-finding phase 1 trial, Fuxius et al [40]
combined gemcitabine at maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
1000 mg/m2 with IFN-α-2b 3 × weekly (MTD 5 × 106 IU)
for 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest (28-day
cycles) in patients with solid tumors, including one patient
with ovarian cancer. This dose of IFNα is much higher
than what we have used because our primary goal was to
boost the immune response. The regimen was safe and
associated with clinical data worth further investigations.
Unfortunately, no immune monitoring was performed that
would allow further comparison with our study.
This is a small dose finding study, and therefore
underpowered to demonstrate efficacy in this challenging
populationHowever, this study showed that gemcitabine
treatment, immune modulation with Pegintron and
therapeutic vaccination is a well-tolerated approach in
the development of combined chemo-immunotherapeutic
regimens to treat cancer. Gemcitabine may be administered
as part of the standard of care, such as in this study, but can
also be used in combination with T-cell stimulatory based
immunotherapeutic strategies for its ability to decrease the
number of immune suppressive in future studies.
