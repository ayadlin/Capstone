Abstract
The TMPRSS2/ERG (T/E) fusion gene is present and thought to be an oncogenic driver of approximately half of
all prostate cancers. Fusion of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 promoter to the ERG oncogene results in
constitutive high level expression of ERG which promotes prostate cancer invasion and proliferation. Here, we
report the characterization of multiple alternatively spliced T/E fusion gene isoforms which have differential
effects on invasion and proliferation. We found that T/E fusion gene isoforms differentially increase NF-kB–
mediated transcription, which may explain in part the differences in biological activities of the T/E fusion
isoforms. This increased activity is due to phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 on Ser536. Tissue microarray
immunochemistry revealed that p65 phospho-Ser536 is present in the majority of prostate cancers where it
is associated with ERG protein expression. The T/E fusion gene isoforms differentially increase expression of a
number of NF-kB associated genes including PAR1, CCL2, FOS, TLR3, and TLR4 (Toll-like receptor). TLR4
activation is known to promote p65 Ser536 phosphorylation and knockdown of TLR4 with shRNA decreases
Ser536 phosphorylation in T/E fusion gene expressing cells. TLR4 can be activated by proteins in the tumor
microenvironment and lipopolysacharide from Gram () bacteria. Our findings suggest that bacterial infection
of the prostate and/or endogenous microenvironment proteins may promote progression of high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and/or prostate cancers that express the T/E fusion gene, where the NFkB pathway might be targeted as a rational therapeutic approach. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1325–33. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The discovery of recurrent fusion of the androgen-regulated
TMPRSS2 gene to the ETS transcription factors (1), particularly the ERG gene, in the majority of prostate cancer (PCa)
lesions, has led to intensive study of the biological and clinical
consequences of these rearrangements in PCa. The TMPRSS2/
ERG (T/E) fusion gene is by far the most common fusion gene
and is present in 40% to 60% of PCas (2, 3). In all cases, the
TMPRSS2 promoter and one or more TMPRSS2 50 exons are
juxtaposed to the ERG exons, with deletion of the ERG
promoter. Therefore, the fusion transcripts are under the
control of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 promoter, resulting in the constitutive high level expression of ERG fusion

transcripts in the neoplastic prostatic epithelium bearing this
fusion gene. ERG shares a conserved 85 amino acid DNAbinding domain with other ETS factors, which are generally
oncogenic and promote tumor progression in a number of
malignancies.
There is significant heterogeneity in the structures of the T/E
fusion transcripts, both at the 50 end of the mRNA (2, 3) and
downstream ERG coding exons (4). We previously characterized 8 fusion isoforms based on the fusion junction structure
(3). The most common transcript contains the TMPRSS2 exon
1 fused to ERG exon 4, which we have designated as the type III
isoform (3). This variant is expressed in the vast majority (80%–
90%) of fusion gene expressing PCa, either alone or in combination with other isoforms. Translation would have to arise
from an internal ATG codon because the native ERG ATG is
absent and would thus give rise to a slightly truncated ERG
protein. Of particular interest is an isoform in which TMPRSS2
exon 2 is fused with ERG exon 4 (designated type VI). This
variant was present in 26% of the cases with T/E fusion gene
expression (3). For this isoform, the in-frame fusion results in a
true fusion protein containing the first 5 amino acids of the
TMPRSS2 gene fused to a slightly truncated ERG protein. We
found that expression of this isoform is associated with
aggressive disease. Subsequent studies have shown that the
type VI isoform enhances proliferation and invasion of immortalized prostatic epithelial cells to a greater extent than the type
III isoform, consistent with the clinical associations (4). In

addition, we have identified multiple alternative splicing exons
of ERG by cloning and sequencing of the fusion gene transcripts
(4). In particular, alternative splicing leading to inclusion or
exclusion of a 72-bp exon (genomic exon 11) is common. We
have shown that the presence of this 72-bp exon significantly
enhances proliferation and invasion of immortalized prostate
epithelial cells when compared with mRNAs with the same 50
structure that lack this exon. Thus alternative splicing of the 50
region and the coding exons of the T/E fusion gene, as well as
the ratio of the various isoforms, can impact the biological
activities of the fusion gene.
The T/E fusion gene can promote PCa invasion and to a
lesser extent proliferation and decrease differentiation via
several known pathways such as urokinase-type plasminogen
activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and C-myc
that have previously been implicated in PCa initiation and
progression (5–8). Here, we report that NF-kB transcriptional
activity is increased by T/E fusions. The NF-kB pathway
activation is associated with aggressive clinical behavior in
PCa (9). Phosphorylation of p65 has been shown by many
groups to enhance p65 transcriptional activity (10). We have
found that T/E fusion type isoforms enhance NF-kB transcriptional activity 3-fold in prostatic epithelial cells. Significantly
increased phosphorylation of the NF-kB p65 subunit on Ser536
was observed in stably selected PNT1a cells expressing T/E
fusion isoforms whereas VCaP cells with stable knockdown of
the T/E fusion gene by shRNA show a marked decrease in p65
Ser536 phosphorylation. Using immunohistochemistry, we
have found that p65 phospho-Ser536 is present in the majority
of PCa tissues and its expression is associated with expression
of the ERG protein. Further investigation revealed upregulation
of several genes related to NF-kB pathway by the fusion gene,
including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The TLR4 protein can
activate the NF-kB pathway and increase p65 Ser536 phosphorylation when activated (11, 12). We verified upregulation
of TLR-4 mRNA by T/E fusions and decreased p65 phosphoSer536 in PNT1a cells expressing the T/E fusion was seen when
TLR4 was knocked down. Thus, the NF-kB pathway is activated
by phosphorylation via TLR4 activation in fusion gene expressing cells, linking the expression of this common fusion gene to
a key pathway in PCa progression which can potentially be
activated by bacterial lipopolysacharide (LPS) and/or tumor
microenvironment proteins.

Western blotting
Anti-p65 and anti-phos-p65 Ser536 (both from Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1,000 dilution for Western
blotting using procedures described previously (13). Antib-actin control was performed as described previously (13).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry of VCaP orthotopic tumors was
performed using a rabbit polyclonal p65 anti-phosphoSer536 from Abgent Inc. (AP3178a) as described previously
(14). Slides were scanned and photographed using a Nikon
Eclipse E400 microscope connected with Nuance Multispectral Imaging System at 200 magnification with 3.3 megapixel
resolution. Images were saved as JPEG files with 6 to 8 images
were taken for each slide, covering the entire tumor area. All
staining signals are localized to cell nuclei. The numerical
value for percent stained (PS) is determined by using Image
software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

Cell culture
PNT1a cells were maintained in the RPMI with 10% FBS.
HEK293T cells and Cos7 cells were maintained in DMEM
medium with 10% FBS.

Protein subcellular localization
Cos7 cells were cultured in 4-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek)
and transfected with NF-kB p65 along with T/E fusions type
IIIþ72 or VIþ72, which have the V5 tag (4), or control vector
(pCMV-Tag2B). Cells were fixed 48 hours after transfection
with 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes and incubated with 0.5%
bovine serum albumin for 30 minutes. Antibodies (anti-V5
from Invitrogen, anti-p65, and anti-phospho-Ser536 from Cell
Signaling) were applied to cells overnight at 4 C. Fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (1:500 dilution) was used for detection of fusion
proteins, and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITCconjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 dilution) was used
for total p65 or phospho-Ser536 p65 staining. Both secondary
antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. For
nuclear staining, 1 mL of mounting solution was applied with
DAPI (Vectashield, Vector) following manufacturer's instructions. Slides were mounted and observed under Nikon Eclipse
E400 microscope connected with Nuance Multispectral Imaging System. Cells with positive fluorescence staining in 10
random fields at 200 magnification field were counted. This
experiment was repeated twice.

Transfection and NF-kB reporter assays
Transient transfection was conducted in triplicate in 24well plates as described previously (13). The NF-kB luciferase
reporter vector was obtained from Stratagene (Cat 219077,
PathDetect, Stratagene). Luciferase activity was determined
on triplicate samples and each experiment was repeated at
least 3 times.

Tissue microarrays
PCa tissue microarrays have been described previously
(15–18). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described
above for the VCaP tumors. Arrays stained with anti-phosphoSer536 were scanned and staining quantitated using a multiplicative staining index of intensity (0–3) and extent
(0–3) of staining yielding a 10-point staining index (0–9) as

day, medium containing 20 mmol/L PS1145 (Sigma Aldrich,
P6624) were added to the wells in treatment group. Cells
were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter counter at
different time points in triplicate. The experiment was
repeated twice.

described in previous publications (15–18). The arrays were
also stained with anti-ERG antibody as described by Park and
colleagues (19). Cancer nuclei were scored as positive or
negative and cancers were considered positive if ERG staining
was seen in cancer cells in any tissue core. In almost all cases
in which positive staining was seen it involved the majority of
cancer cells in all cores. No staining of benign epithelial nuclei
was identified although strong staining of endothelial cells
was noted as described previously (19) which was useful as an
internal positive control.
NF-kB signaling pathway PCR array
Human NF-kB Signaling Pathway PCR Array from SA
Biosciences was used to analyze cDNAs from PNT1a cells
overexpressing T/E fusion type IIIþ72, type VIþ72 or vector
control following the manufacturer's protocol. Individual PCR
primer pair mixes for gene F2R, FOS, TLR3, TLR4, and CCL2
were purchased from SA Biosciences and were used for
quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR as described previously (20). This experiment was repeated twice.
shRNA against TLR4
Two shRNAs targeting TLR4 were purchased from Open
Biosystems, [V2LHS_171352 (shRNAa) and V2LHS_171350
(shRNAb)]. Negative control shRNA was also purchased from
Open Biosystems. Cells were transfected with shRNA plasmids
against TLR4 or negative control shRNA as described previously
(21). TLR4 mRNA levels were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR
as described above. This experiment was repeated twice.

Results
Upregulation of NF-kB transcriptional activities by T/E
fusion isoforms
To explore mechanisms by which T/E fusions affect PCa
initiation and progression, we performed a series of luciferase
reporter assays with a variety of reporter constructs and T/E
fusion gene constructs (data not shown). Among the promoters tested, NF-kB transcriptional activities were the most
highly upregulated. Briefly, we transiently transfected a composite NF-kB promoter construct linked to a luciferase reporter gene into the immortalized normal prostate epithelial
PNT1a cell line with the plasmids expressing the IIIþ72 fusion
gene isoform, the VIþ72 isoform, control empty vector plasmid or VIþ72 deletion constructs missing key ERG domains.
The type IIIþ72 and VIþ72 isoforms enhanced NF-kB transcription more than 2-fold and approximately 3-fold, respectively, compared with the control plasmid at 24 hours after
transfection (Fig. 1) and this difference was statistically significant from control for both fusion gene isoforms (P < 0.02;
t test). Similar results were seen at 8 to 72 hours after
transfection (data not shown). Control transfections with
VIþ72 expression constructs with deletion of the ETS or
CAE domain had activities that were even lower than control
(Fig. 1), suggesting a possible dominant-negative activity
directed against basal ERG expressed in PNT1a cells. Similar
results were seen in 293T cells, although the induction was
more robust (Supplementary Fig. S1).

PNT1a cells were transiently cotransfected with a NF-kB reporter
construct and plasmids expressing the IIIþ72 T/E fusion gene, the VIþ72
T/E fusion gene, the type VIþ72 expression construct with deletion of the
ETS or central activation (CAE) domains and vector controls (CON). Wells
were transfected in triplicate and the experiment was repeated 3 times. SD
are shown. Both the type III þ72 and VIþ72 expression constructs were
statistically significantly increased over controls (P ¼ 0.02 and P ¼ 0.004,
respectively, t test; indicated by asterisks).

Induction of p65 phospho-Ser536 by T/E fusion
isoforms
Phosphorylation of p65 has been shown to enhance p65
transcriptional activity and phosphorylation at Ser536 regulates NF-kB p65 activation, nuclear localization, protein–
protein interactions, and transcriptional activity (10, 22, 23).
We therefore examined phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 in
stably selected PNT1a cells expressing T/E fusion gene isoforms. Both fusion gene expressing cell lines displayed significantly increased phosphorylation of the NF-kB p65 subunit
on Ser536 (Fig. 2A) with unchanged total p65 protein. Of note,
the VIþ72 cell line had a higher level of p65 phospho-Ser536
than cells expressing the IIIþ72 isoform. VCaP cells with
stable knockdown of the T/E fusion gene by ShRNA that
we have generated previously (see ref. 4) showed a marked
decrease in levels of p65 phospho-Ser536. In previous studies,
we used these shRNA and vector control VCaP cell lines for
tumor progression studies following orthotopic injection and
shown decreased tumor progression in shRNA expressing cells
(4). We performed immunohistochemistry on 9 VCaP orthotopic tumors with stable knockdown of the fusion gene versus
10 vector controls using anti-p65 phospho-Ser536 antibody
and quantitated percentage of cells with positive nuclear
staining in each tumor. The tumors with stable T/E fusion
knockdown had a significantly lower p65 phospho-Ser536
staining percentage by image analysis (36.9% vs. 48.8%; P <
0.002; t test). All staining was nuclear, with no cytoplasmic
staining. Of note, VCaP cells, the only PCa cell line that
expresses the T/E fusion gene, is also the only PCa cell line
that expresses significant levels of Ser536 phosphorylated p65
(Fig. 2B). Therefore, T/E fusions enhance NF-kB activities
through increased phosphorylation at the p65 Ser536 site.

labeling techniques. The inactive form of NF-kB is localized in
the cytoplasm and mainly consists of multiple subunits
including the DNA-binding p50 and p65 subunits and an
inhibitory subunit Ikb, which is bound to p65 and masks
the nuclear localization sequence and its release initiates the
activation of NF-kB and its subsequent translocation to the
nucleus. Cos7 cells were transfected with NF-kB p65 along
with T/E fusions type IIIþ72 or VIþ72, which have a V5 tag (4),
or control vector (pCMV-Tag2B). FITC-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody was used for detection of fusion
proteins, and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was
used for total p65 or phospho-Ser536 p65 staining. As
expected, T/E fusion isoforms were seen exclusively in the
nucleus with similar total expression level for each fusion type
(data not shown). A similar number of cells with total nuclear
p65 staining was observed in both fusion groups and the
control group (Fig. 2C). A significantly higher number of p65
phospho-Ser536 expressing cells were found following
cotransfection with fusion gene expressing constructs compared with the control group (Fig. 2D).
Expression of NF-kB p65 phospho-Ser536 in PCa
To determine whether NF-kB p65 Ser536 phosphorylation
is relevant to human PCa, we carried out an immunohistochemical analysis of 371 clinically localized PCas using tissue
microarrays. Expression was quantitated as described previously (15–18, 24–27) based on a multiplicative index of the
average staining intensity (0–3) and extent of staining (1–3) in
the cores yielding a 10-point staining index (0–9). Examples of
strong (index 9), moderate (index 6), weak (index 3), and no
(index 0) staining are shown in Figure 3A. The mean staining
index was 4.5 and 85% of cancers showed some staining (i.e.,
>0). NF-kB p65 Ser536 phosphorylation was weakly correlated
with Gleason score (r2 ¼ 0.122; P ¼ 0.02) but not with other
pathologic variables. Compared with cancers with no expression, cancers with p65 phospho-Ser536 had a significantly
decreased time to recurrence (P ¼ 0.005; log rank) as shown in
the Kaplan–Meier plot in Figure 3B. Cox regression was
significant by univariate (HR ¼ 3.83, 95% CI: 1.41–10.43; P
¼ 0.0086) and multivariate (HR ¼ 3.64, 95% CI: 1.13–11.73; P ¼
0.03) analysis. Thus, the presence p65 Ser536 phosphorylation
is common in PCa and influences clinical outcome.
We next explored the association of NF-kB p65 Ser536
phosphorylation expression in PCa with the expression of
ERG using the protocol described by Park and colleagues (19)
to detect ERG expression by immunohistochemistry in the
same tissue microarray analyzed for p65 phospho-Ser536
expression. The presence of any level of ERG expression in
tumor cells as detected by this antibody is highly correlated
with the presence of the T/E fusion gene (19). We therefore
dichotomized staining into positive and negative for ERG.
Overall, 364 of 371 cancers informative for p65 phosphoSer536 staining could also be evaluated for ERG expression.
In the vast majority of cases, ERG staining was strong and in
all cases was confined to cancer nuclei, with no staining of
benign epithelium. Strong staining of endothelial cells was
noted as described previously (19), which represents expression of endogenous ERG in these cells. A total of 164 cases

were positive, representing 45% of evaluable cases, consistent
with prior reported rates of T/E fusion gene expression in
surgically treated PCa. ERG-positive cancers tended to have a
shorter time to recurrence following radical prostatectomy
(Supplementary Fig. S2), but the difference between ERG-

www.aacrjournals.org

positive and -negative cases was not statistically significant
(P ¼ .312; log rank). We then compared the expression index
for p65 phospho-Ser536 in fusion gene–positive and fusion
gene–negative cases. The expression index was significantly
higher in ERG expressing PCa (mean ¼ 5.29, median ¼ 6.0)
versus ERG-negative PCa (mean ¼ 3.98, median ¼ 3.0) by
Mann–Whitney test (P < 0.001). Of note, there was no significant difference in the matched benign prostate tissues
from ERG-positive and -negative cancers in p65 phosphoSer536 expression. We also examined the fraction of cases that
were ERG positive at various levels of p65 phospho-Ser536
expression. As seen in Figure 3C, the percentage of ERGpositive cases was only 17% in cases with no p65 phosphoSer536 staining (staining index 0) and this increased to 60% in
cases with strong staining (index 7–9). The differences seen
were highly statistically significant (P < 0.001, c2). To confirm
the reproducibility of the NF-kB phospho-Ser536 scoring
system when grouped in this manner, a second observer
scored 270 individual tissue cores. Only 4 of 270 cores had
a difference in scoring that resulted in change from one
scoring group to another, indicating that this scoring system
is highly reproducible. Overall, the data strongly support the
concept that ERG can significantly enhance phosphorylation
of p65 at Ser536 in vivo, although other factors clearly play a
role because ERG-negative cases do have phosphorylation at
this site, although at significantly lower levels. We then
analyzed recurrence-free survival on 4 groups of cases
grouped by p65 phospho-Ser536 and ERG expression status.
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The ERG-positive and -negative cases
that did not express p65 phospho-Ser536 were not statistically
significantly different than each other. Among the cases
expressing phospho-Ser536, the ERG-positive cases tended
to have earlier recurrence than the ERG-negative cases,
although this difference was not statistically significant (P
¼ 0.34, log rank). The phospho-Ser536–positive/ERG-positive
cases recurred earlier than both groups of phospho-Ser536
negative cases (P ¼ 0.047 and 0.025, log rank). These data
indicate that NF-kB Ser536 phosphorylation as a result of ERG
expression impacts disease aggressiveness.
NF-kB pathway inhibition decreases proliferation
of VCaP cells
To confirm the importance of the NF-kB pathway in ERG
expressing PCa cell lines, we treated VCaP cells with PS1145,
an inhibitor of IKK (28). As shown in Figure 4, PS1145 significantly inhibited VCaP proliferation (P < 0.001, day 7, t test),
confirming that NF-kB pathway plays an important role in
proliferation in PCa cells expressing the T/E fusion gene.
Genes in NF-kB pathway upregulated by T/E fusion
isoforms
To further explore the activation of the NF-kB pathway by
the fusion isoforms, we used a SuperArray NF-kB PCR Array to
analyze RNAs from vector control PNT1a cells and stably
transfected PNT1a cells expressing the IIIþ72 or VIþ72 isoforms. Genes which were upregulated by 3-fold or more in one
or both fusion gene expressing cells lines were then confirmed
using standard quantitative RT-PCR. Results are shown in

Increased NF-kB p65 phospho-Ser536 by T/E fusion
isoforms is mediated through TLR4
Because the overexpression of T/E fusion isoforms can
upregulate TLR4 expression and there is evidence that TLR4
can increase phosphorylation of p65 Ser536 when activated
(11,12), we hypothesized that NF-kB transcription activated by
T/E fusions is mediated through TLR4 pathway. Therefore, we
carried out a knockdown experiment to determine whether

p65 phospho-Ser536 level can be affected by decreased TLR4
expression in fusion gene expressing cells. We tested 2 ShRNA
plasmids targeting TLR4 in PNT1a cells expressing the type
VIþ72 isoform, which showed the highest TLR4 expression at
RNA level, by transient transfection. The knockdown efficiencies for the 2 shRNA plasmids are 53% and 40%, respectively, by
quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6A). Dramatically decreased p65
phospho-Ser536 was seen in both transfectants by Western
blot (Fig. 6B). Therefore, our in vitro data support our hypothesis that NF-kB p65 phospho-Ser536 upregulation by T/E
fusion isoforms is mediated at least in part through TLR4.

We report here for the first time that T/E fusion isoforms can
activate NF-kB transcriptional activity through increased p65
Ser536 phosphorylation. Clinical and preclinical observations
have shown that NF-kB plays an important role in PCa growth,
survival, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and metastatic progression (29–33). To date, investigations in PCa have focused on
expression and translocation of p50/p65 subunits. Our data
indicate that p65 phosphorylation also plays a role in modulating PCa progression and is increased in fusion gene expressing cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that TLR4 plays an
important role in increasing p65 Ser536 phosphorylation in
fusion gene expressing cells. Of note, ETS factor binding sites

Activation of NF-kB by TMPRSS2/ERG Fusion Isoforms via TLR4

in the TLR4 promoter may play an important role of TLR4
mRNA expression (34), raising the possibility that TLR4 may be
a direct target of the T/E fusion gene.
TLR4 is well known for its role in immune cells, in particular, its significant role in response to LPS produced by Gram
() bacteria (11). DU145 and PC3 PCa cell lines also express
TLR4 (35, 36). Knockdown of TLR4 in PC3 cells with siRNA
significantly decreased invasion, survival, and tumorigenicity
(35). Finally, it has been shown that specific sequence variants
of TLR4 are associated with risk of PCa (37). TLR4 is a potent
regulator of NF-kB signaling and has been shown to increase
p65 Ser536 phosphorylation when activated (11, 12). It should
be noted that although TLR4 is activated by LPS, it can also be
activated by endogenous ligands, such as hyaluronic acid,
fibronectin, and heparin sulfate (38), which are abundant in
the tumor microenvironment. It has been suggested that
activation of TLR4 by LPS released from infection of the
prostate by Gram () bacteria may promote tumorigenicity
(39). Symptomatic prostatitis occurs in approximately 10% of
men whereas the prevalence of asymptomatic prostatitis in
unknown. There is a correlation between inflammation and
the detection of bacterial RNA in the PCa tissues (40). Whether
endogenous ligands or LPS or both activate TLR4 in fusion
gene expressing cells is an important question. If LPS does
indeed play a role, this is clinically important in that it
indicates that a potentially treatable infectious process may
promote PCa initiation and/or progression.
TLR3 is also increased in response to fusion gene expression. TLR3 is expressed by both LNCaP and PC3 cell lines (41).
TLR3 responds to dsRNA or poly I:C (12). Of note, activation of
TLR3 can activate NF-kB and MAPK but can also induce
apoptosis and has been shown to do so in LNCaP cells (41).
Thus, it is possible that the observed induction of TLR3 may be
exploited therapeutically in PCa if indeed TLR3 activation
induces apoptosis rather than tumor promotion. Such direct
antitumor effects would synergize with the known ability of
dsRNA to promote antitumor immunity (42).
PAR1 (thrombin receptor) is a G-protein coupled receptor
that has previously been shown to be overexpressed in human
PCa (43,44) and is among the genes we found to be upregulated. Of note, PAR1 is strongly expressed and biologically
active in VCaP cells (44). PAR1 is activated by thrombin and
Factor 10a. The uPA pathway and MMPs (upregulated by the
T/E fusion gene) can enhance PAR1 activation by enhancing
thrombin formation in the tumor microenvironment. PAR1
can activate NF-kB in PCa cells (43) as well other cell types.
Interestingly, a functional ETS element has been shown to be
present at position 506 in the PAR1 promoter (45), raising the
possibility that PAR1 may be direct transcriptional target of
the T/E fusion gene protein.

CCL2 (MCP-1) is a chemokine which is a potent regulator of
PCa cell migration and proliferation and acts, at least in part,
via activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway (46) and is a
well-known direct transcriptional target of NF-kB (47). CCL2
is expressed by endothelial cells within the tumor microenvironment but can also be expressed by tumor cells directly (48).
Of note, VCaP cells express CCL2 and secrete it into the media
(48). Furthermore, the CCL2 receptor, CCR2, is expressed by
PCa cells (48). CCL2 has been shown to significantly enhance
growth of PCa bone metastases, the most common site of PCa
metastasis and may act synergistically with PAR1 (see above)
to promote migration (49).
Finally, we noted a significant upregulation of FOS by the T/
E fusion gene. c-JUN is upregulated by the fusion gene and cJUN can bind c-FOS. It is known that AP-1 can synergize with
NF-kB to promote expression of specific target genes including proangiogenic genes such as interleukin (IL)-8 and VEGF
(50). Thus, increased FOS expression may enhance the tumor
promoting activities of the NF-kB pathway.
In summary, our study has identified a unique mechanism
by which T/E fusion genes contribute to PCa tumorigenesis by
upregulating the NF-kB pathway. We hypothesize that in a
subset of PCa, T/E fusions can upregulate TLR4, and then
activated TLR4 increases NF-kB transcriptional activities,
resulting in expression of genes favoring tumor cell growth
and invasion. This process can be enhanced by exposure of
fusion gene expressing cells to Gram () bacteria, which
releases LPS, and/or exposure to endogenous proteins in
the tumor microenvironment. These findings have implications for prevention and treatment of PCa by treatment Gram
() prostatic infections and targeting the NF-kB pathway.
