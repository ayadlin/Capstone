ABSTRACT
There is strong evidence that stromal cells promote drug resistance of cancer.
Here, we show that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and carcinoma-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) desensitize ERα-positive breast cancer cells to the anti-estrogen
fulvestrant. In search for the mechanism, we found that MSCs and CAFs similarly
increased the activity of the PI3K/AKT and the JAK/STAT3 pathways and upregulated
the expression of integrin β1, IGF1R, HIF1α, CAIX and Bcl-3 in MCF-7 cells. Further
analyses revealed that MSCs and CAFs coordinately induce these changes by
triggering the downregulation of IGFBP5. Loss of IGFBP5 in MCF-7 cells was an
early and long-lasting event in response to MSCs and CAFs and was accompanied
by growth stimulation both in the absence and presence of fulvestrant. The growthstimulatory effect in the absence of fulvestrant could be attributed to PI3K/AKT
pathway activation and could be mimicked by insulin. The growth-promoting effect
in the presence of fulvestrant depended upon the upregulation of Bcl-3. By cRNA
microarray analysis we identified additional IGFBP5 targets, of which two (KLHL4 and
SEPP1) were inversely regulated by IGFBP5 and Bcl-3. BT474 cells also responded
to stromal cells by downregulating IGFBP5 and upregulating the P-AKT, Bcl-3 and
IGF1R levels, whereas T47D cells did not show any of these responses. In conclusion,
our data suggest that, by targeting IGFBP5 expression in ERα-positive breast cancer
cells, such as MCF-7 cells, MSCs and CAFs are able to orchestrate a variety of events,
particularly activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, upregulation of Bcl-3 expression
and desensitization to anti-estrogen.

INTRODUCTION

aromatase inhibitors (endocrine therapy). SERM (selective
estrogen receptor modulator)-like anti-estrogens, such as
tamoxifen, act by blocking ERα activity, SERDs (selective
estrogen receptor downregulators), such as fulvestrant,
additionally downregulate ERα expression. Aromatase
inhibitors interfere with ERα activity by inhibiting
estrogen synthesis, thereby causing estrogen deficiency.
Anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors significantly reduce
breast cancer mortality of patients suffering from ERαpositive, but not ERα-negative breast cancer confirming
the selectivity of these drugs [3]. The success of endocrine
therapies, however, is limited by resistance to these
drugs (endocrine resistance), either pre-existing (intrinsic

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in
women and the leading cause of cancer death in women
world-wide [1]. As a heterogeneous disease breast
cancer can be divided into subgroups either based
on immunochemical or gene expression analysis [2].
Immunochemically, the ERα (estrogen receptor α)-positive
breast cancer, the most common breast cancer subtype, can
be distinguished from Her2 (human epidermal receptor
2)-positive and triple negative breast cancers (negative for
ERα, Her2 and progesterone receptor). ERα-positive breast
cancers can selectively be treated with anti-estrogens or

resistance) or developed in the course of treatment
(acquired resistance) [4, 5].
Acquired resistance can be facilitated by the tumor
stroma [6–8]. Both, extracellular matrix and stromal
cells are able to protect cancer cells against drugs. The
carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF), an important
component of the tumor stroma and involved in tumor
progression, plays a major role in the acquisition of drug
resistance [9]. CAFs, a type of activated fibroblasts, can
be generated from different cell types, among which is the
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) [10]. MSCs are commonly
residing in the bone marrow and are attracted to wounds
and cancer lesions [11, 12]. Once having entered a cancer
lesion, they start interacting with the tumor cells, which
most often leads to cancer progression. Like CAFs,
MSCs have found to contribute to the acquisition of drug
resistance [8, 13].
There are many mechanisms described that could
lead to endocrine resistance [4, 5]. Often, this involves the
activation of the survival pathway PI3K (phosphoinositol3-kinase)/AKT [14]. Also the activation of the Ras/Raf/
MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway can be protective against ERαdirected drugs. The activation of either pathway can
lead to phosphorylation of ERα, allowing ERα to act
independently of estrogen. Both pathways are commonly
activated through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
[15]. Of the RTKs, IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1
receptor) may be of particular importance for endocrine
resistance, as it interacts with ERα [16] and its agonist
IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) shares with ERα the
ability to down-regulate critical growth repressor genes
[17]. Regulation of IGF1R activity is complex and is not
only controlled by its ligands IGF-1 and −2, but also by
the IGF inhibitors IGFBP1-6 (IGF binding proteins 1–6)
[15]. Interestingly, of these inhibitors, IGFBP2 has been
shown to regulate ERα activity [18]. Of note, IGFBPs can
also act in an IGF-independent manner [19]. E.g., IGFBP5
has been reported to increase survival of MCF-7 cells in
nutrient-poor conditions [20].
Besides RTKs, integrins, such as integrin β1, are
typical activators of PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK1/
ERK1/2 pathways [21] and have also been linked to
endocrine resistance [8]. Also the NFκB (nuclear factor
of κB) pathway, which interferes with ERα activity
in multiple ways [22, 23], has been implicated in the
acquisition of endocrine resistance [24, 25]. Specifically,
Bcl-3 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 3), a member of the
atypical IκB family and regulator of NFκB activity in the
nucleus [26, 27], has been shown to promote proliferation
of MCF-7 cells under estrogen deficiency [28]. Bcl-3 is
also linked to breast cancer metastasis [29].
CAFs have been shown to induce resistance to
the SERM tamoxifen by activating the PI3K/AKT and/
or Ras/Raf/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathways [30, 31], though
other mechanisms have also been reported, which include
synthesis of estrogen by CAFs [32] or secretion of ketone
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bodies and lactate by autophagic CAFs [33]. Little is
known about the mechanisms by which MSCs induce
resistance to ERα-targeting drugs. One report shows that
higher expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) may
be linked to the ability of MSCs to support growth of
ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells under estrogen
deficiency [34].
We explored the possibility that MSCs and CAFs
may interfere with the SERD-like anti-estrogen fulvestrant
(ICI 182,780), which also downregulates ERα protein
levels. We found that either stromal cell type promoted
growth of ERα-positive breast cancer cells, such as MCF7 cells, in the presence of fulvestrant. Searching for the
underlying mechanism, we identified Bcl-3 as a major
mediator of protection against fulvestrant and found that
Bcl-3 was regulated by MSCs and CAFs along with other
proteins and phospho-proteins in a coordinated manner
through IGFBP5.

RESULTS
MSCs and CAFs promote resistance of MCF-7
cells to the anti-estrogen fulvestrant
To show that the anti-estrogen fulvestrant interferes
with the activity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we
examined the effects of fulvestrant on cell growth, on the
expression of selected proteins, on spheroid formation
and on expression of mesenchymal and stem cell
markers. The incubation of MCF-7 cells with fulvestrant
at a final concentration of 100 nM for six days strongly
reduced growth of individual clones in clonogenic assays
(Figure 1A). Along with it, the protein expression of the
proliferation marker Ki67 substantially decreased (Figure
1B). Also, as expected, fulvestrant diminished the protein
level of ERα (Figure 1B). Furthermore, fulvestrant
downregulated P-AKT and P-ERK1/2 levels (Figure 1B)
suggesting that fulvestrant exerts an inhibitory effect on
the PI3K/AKT- and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathways.
Fulvestrant also interfered with cell aggregation in 3D
suspension cultures and led to the generation of smaller
spheroids (Figure 1C). In addition, fulvestrant significantly
induced the RNA expression of the mesenchymal proteins
vimentin, fibronectin and ACTA2 (α-smooth muscle
actin) und induced the expression of a couple of stem cell
markers, such as PROCR, ABCG2 (ATP binding cassette
subfamily G2) and ALDH3A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase
3 family, member A1) (Figure 1D) while reducing the
expression of the stem cell marker CD44. This may
suggest that fulvestrant promotes the expansion of a pool
of cells of a more mesenchymal phenotype, which may be
more resistant to fulvestrant.
Next, we studied the effects of MSCs and CAFs on
MCF-7 growth in the presence and absence of fulvestrant.
When MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with MSCs at a ratio
of 10:1 for five days and compared to MCF-7 cells grown

alone, average colony size was significantly increased in
the presence, but not in the absence of fulvestrant (Figure
1E). Growing MCF-7 cells in growth medium that contains
20% conditioned medium from MSCs (20% MSCCM) or from CAFs (20% CAF-CM) had similar strong
promoting effects on the growth of individual colonies
in the presence of fulvestrant (Figure 1E). Unlike MSCs,
20% MSC-CM or 20% CAF-CM had also some moderate
effects on colony growth in the absence of fulvestrant. In
a different set of experiments with an ATP-based growth
assay, cell growth was monitored after cells had been
seeded at higher cell density that prevented the formation
of individual colonies, but still left sufficient space for
cell growth over a growth period of five days. Also under
these conditions, CAF-CM was able to strongly increase
cell growth in the presence of fulvestrant, but failed to
promote growth or even reduced growth in the absence of
fulvestrant (Figure 1F).
We next sought to analyze whether stromal cells also
affect spheroid formation. We found that 20% CAFCM increases the size of spheroids both in the presence
and absence of fulvestrant (Figure 1G). However, these
effects did not seem to be the result of increased MCF7 cell growth. It rather seemed that CAF-CM causes the
MCF-7 cells in the spheroids to be more loosely packed
(Figure 1G) This may be the result of a reduced cell-cell
contact as was found in spheroids that MCF-7 cells had
formed in the presence of MSCs [35]. Next, we examined
whether CAF-CM affected the expression of mesenchymal
and stem cell markers. Of the selected markers, only
fibronectin-1 showed increased RNA levels upon treatment
with CAF-CM both in the presence and absence of
fulvestrant (Figure 1H). In the absence of fulvestrant, also
the expression of ALDH3A1 was increased by CAF-CM.
Collectively, these data suggest that MSCs and
CAFs secrete certain factors that protect MCF-7 cells from
the growth-inhibitory effect of fulvestrant. Since most of
the selected mesenchymal and stem cell markers were not
affected by CAF-CM, it is unlikely that the stroma cellinduced protective effect against fulvestrant is mediated
by an increase in the stem/progenitor cell pool of the
MCF-7 cells.

resistance and/or deregulation of ERα activity [14, 16, 17,
21, 28, 36, 37]. To study the activities of the four pathways
we determined the phospho-protein levels of AKT,
ERK1/2, STAT3 and the plasma-membrane level of the
hypoxia-regulated protein CAIX (carbon anhydrase) [38]
by Western blot analysis. To mimic potential effects on the
PI3K/AKT- and the Ras/Raf/MEK1/ERK1/2- pathways
by stromal cells we used insulin, shown to induce these
pathways in MCF-7 cells [39]. To recapitulate potential
stromal cell effects on the hypoxia-regulated pathway we
used the hypoxia-mimetic agent CoCl2.
We found that a 3-day-incubation of MCF-7 cells
with 20% MSC- or 20% CAF-CM similarly increased
phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3, while having no
effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2A). Both
CMs also increased plasma membrane abundance of
CAIX. As shown with CAF-CM, also the level of CAIXregulator HIF1α (hypoxia inducible factor 1α) was
raised (Figure 2B). This suggests that MSC- and CAFCM activate the PI3K/AKT-, the JAK2/STAT3- and the
hypoxia-regulated pathway, whereas it had no effect on
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway. However, limiting
the duration of incubation with CAF-CM to overnight
led to an increase in the P-ERK1/2 levels (Supplementary
Figure S1) suggesting that the activation of the Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK1/2 pathway by stromal cell CM is temporary.
MSC- and CAF-CM also increased the plasma membrane
levels of IGF1R and integrin β1 and the nuclear protein
level of Bcl-3 (Figure 2A). Of note, the two Bcl-3-specific
protein bands likely correspond to a phosphorylated and
the non-phosphorylated form of Bcl-3, of which both are
able to regulate transcription [40]. Insulin could mimic
the effect of MSC- and CAF-CM on P-AKT and integrin
β1 (Figure 2A). Also, like stromal cell-CM, insulin
induced a temporary increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure S1). However, unlike stromal cellCM, insulin did not modulate the levels of P-STAT3, Bcl3, IGF1R and CAIX (Figure 2A). The hypoxia-mimetic
agent CoCl2, that strongly induced the expression of HIF1α
protein und CAIX in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2B), shared
with insulin the ability to increase the integrin β1 level
and also, like insulin, had no effect on Bcl-3 expression
(Figure 2C). However, unlike insulin, CoCl2 recapitulated
the effect of MSC- and CAF-CM on CAIX, P-STAT3,
IGF1R expression, while having no effect on P-AKT
(Figure 2C). Consequently, when combined, insulin and
CoCl2 could mimic most of the effects of MSC- and CAFCM. The only two tested stroma cell-responsive proteins
whose expression remained unchanged in response to a
combined treatment with insulin and CoCl2 were Bcl-3
and IGF1R.
To test whether Bcl-3 and IGF1R expression are
linked, we downregulated Bcl-3 by a Bcl-3-specific
siRNA (siBcl3). In fact, siBcl3 attenuated the effect of
CAF-CM on the expression of IGF1R and also on that
of CAIX, while it strongly increased the integrin β1 level

MSC- and CAF-CM interfere with the activities
of signaling pathways and the expression of
proteins involved in drug resistance
To identify the mechanism that underlies the
MSC/CAF-induced fulvestrant resistance, we examined
the expression of a number of proteins, integrin β1,
IGF1R and Bcl-3, and the activities of a number of
signaling pathways, the PI3K/AKT-, the Ras/Raf/MEK1/
ERK1/2-pathways, the JAK2 (janus kinase 2)/STAT3
(signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and
the hypoxia-regulated pathway. All these proteins and
signaling pathways have been associated with drug

Figure 2: MSC- and CAF-CM upregulate the activities of signaling pathways and expression of proteins relevant in
the acquisition of drug resistance. Western blot analyses of the indicated proteins and phospho-proteins were performed after MCF-

7 cells were incubated with insulin, 100 μM CoCl2, insulin plus CoCl2 (ins./CoCl2), MSC- or CAF-CM and/or transfected with siBcl3,
siSTAT3 or with the control siRNA siLuc. Depending on the cellular location of the protein or phospho-protein, either the cytosolic (CE),
nuclear (NE) or plasma membrane (PM) extract was used for the analysis A–C, E. For the visualization of the HIF1α protein, whole
cell extracts (WCE) were prepared by lysing cells in RIPA buffer B. To check for equal loading of plasma membrane proteins, proteins
remaining in the gel after blotting were stained with Coomassie Blue (Coom.).

(Figure 2D). This suggests that stromal cells induce the
expression of IGF1R and also CAIX by upregulating the
Bcl-3 level. Since STAT3 can regulate Bcl-3 expression
in prostate cancer [41], we wondered whether STAT3
and Bcl-3 expression are also linked in MCF-7 cells.
However, knock-down of STAT3 by a STAT3-specific
siRNA (siSTAT3) only slightly reduced CAF-CM-induced
Bcl-3 expression and, with it, also weakly diminished the
levels of IGF1R and CAIX (Figure 2E). Hence, activation
of STAT3 by stromal cell CM is unlikely to be the major
cause for CM-induced Bcl-3 expression, although it may
contribute to it.

In addition, the suppressive effect of CAF-CM on IGFBP5
levels was long-lasting.
To analyze whether downregulation of IGFBP5 is
sufficient to induce the observed effects of MSCs and
CAFs on MCF-7 cells, MCF-7 cells were treated with an
IGFBP5-specific siRNA (siIGFBP5). siIGFBP5 decreased
IGFBP5 levels by ~4-fold, which was comparable to the
decline in IGFBP5 expression as observed in response to
CAF-CM (Figure 4A). Of note, siSTAT3 had no effect on
IGFBP5 expression suggesting that stromal cell-induced
activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway is not responsible
for the downregulation of the IGFBP5 level. A comparison
of the effects of siIGFBP5 and CAF-CM revealed that
siIGFBP5 was as effective as CAF-CM to upregulate
the levels of P-AKT, Bcl-3 and CAIX (Figure 4B). In
addition, siIGFBP5 slightly increased the levels of IGF1R
and P-STAT3, whereas siIGFBP5 alone failed to modulate
the expression of integrin β1. Interestingly, treatment of
MCF-7 cells with both CAF-CM and siIGFBP5, which
reduced IGFBP5 expression to ~7% of its original level
(Figure 4A), generated the highest levels of Bcl-3, IGF1R,
CAIX, integrin β1 and P-STAT3 (Figure 4B). These
data suggest that stromal cells can induce most of the
observed effects on signaling pathway activity and protein
expression by simply downregulating IGFBP5 expression.

MSCs and CAFs coordinately modulate
signaling pathways and protein expression by
downregulating the IGFBP5 level
Next we analyzed the involvement of the IGF1Rdependent signal pathway in the MSC- and CAFinduced effects for two reasons. One, MSC- and CAFCM upregulated the IGF1R level along with the P-AKT
level. Two, blockage of IGF1R-dependent signaling by
the IGF1R-specific inhibitor PQ401 strongly reduced
the phosphorylation status of AKT (Supplementary
Figure S1). suggesting that IGF1R is a major driver of
the PI3K/AKT pathway in MCF-7 cells. IGF1R activity
is regulated by its activators IGF1 and 2 and by the IGFbinding proteins IGFBP1-6 which regulate the activity of
the IGFs. Besides their IGF-dependent activities, IGFBPs
also show IGF-independent effects [19]. Therefore, in
theory, by modulating IGFBP expression, stromal cells
could modulate IGF-dependent and -independent effects
at the same time. Hence, we analyzed whether CAF-CM is
able to induce changes in the expression of any of the IGFs
and the IGFBPs by quantitative RT-PCR. We also included
IGFBP7 in our analysis, since IGFBP7 was shown to bind
to IGF1R and to block its activation by IGFs [42]. When
we incubated MCF-7 cells with increasing amounts of
CAF-CM (1, 5 and 20%), the mRNA level of IGF2, which
showed higher basal levels than IGF1 (data not shown),
increased up to ~15-fold (Figure 3A). Of the IGFBPs,
IGFBP5, 6 and 7 showed a dose-dependent decline in their
expression in response to CAF-CM, whereas the level of
IGFBP3 increased in the presence of CAF-CM (Figure
3B). Of all IGFBPs, IGFBP5 was expressed at the highest
basal level in MCF-7 cells, followed by IGFBP4 and
IGFBP2 (data not shown). The other four IGFBPs were
much less abundant with IGFBP1 showing the lowest
(barely detectable) expression. Therefore, of all CAF-CMinduced changes in IGFBP expression, the changes in the
IGFBP5 levels should be most relevant for IGF1R activity.
Hence, we focused our further analysis on IGFBP5. We
found that the change in the IGFBP5 level by CAF-CM
was an early event. Four hours of incubation of MCF7 cells with CAF-CM was sufficient to bring IGFBP5
expression down to ~50% of its original level (Figure 3C).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Bcl-3 is involved in stromal cell-induced
fulvestrant resistance
The strong effect of siIGFBP5 on the Bcl-3 level
prompted us to further analyze the link between IGFBP5
and Bcl-3 expression. First, we wanted to confirm
that MSCs also downregulate the IGFBP5 level while
upregulating that of Bcl-3. For this, we used two MSC
isolates and either co-cultured MSCs with MCF-7 cells
in a ratio of 1:50 or added 20% MSC-CM to the MCF-7
cells. Under all conditions, both MSC isolates significantly
downregulated IGFBP5 RNA expression and, at the same
time, upregulated the Bcl-3 RNA level (Figure 4C). We
next compared IGFBP5 levels with those of Bcl-3 in 76
RNA samples isolated from MCF-7 cells either treated
with CAF-CM (closed circles, N = 32) or left untreated
(open circles, N = 44). The data suggest an exponential,
inverse correlation between the expression of both genes
such that changes in IGFBP5 expression have the most
profound effects on Bcl-3 expression when IGFBP5 levels
are low (Figure 4D). The hypothesis that IGFBP5 and
Bcl-3 expression are linked is further supported by the
observation that CAF-CM modulated Bcl-3 mRNA and
protein expression early (Figure 4E, 4F), just as seen with
IGFBP5 (Figure 3C).
Having established that downregulation of IGFBP5
allows MSCs and CAFs to coordinate a number of events,
we explored the possibility that a decline in the IGFBP5
level also affects colony growth of MCF-7 cells. By using
siIGFBP5, we found that a decrease in IGFBP5 expression

resulted in an increase in average colony size both in the
absence and presence of fulvestrant (Figure 5A). To check
whether the PI3K/AKT pathway was responsible for
these effects, we repeated the experiments with insulin.
While insulin was able to significantly increase average
colony growth in the absence of fulvestrant, it failed to

do so in the presence of fulvestrant (Figure 5B). This
suggests that the effect of siIGFBP5 on growth in the
presence of fulvestrant was not caused by the activation
of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Next, we tested whether Bcl-3
may affect MCF-7 cell growth. Strikingly, siBcl-3 did not
significantly alter cell growth in the absence of fulvestrant,

but selectively reduced growth in the presence of
fulvestrant, most profoundly in the presence of CAF-CM
(Figure 5C). This suggests that the increased expression of
Bcl-3 caused by stromal cell-induced downregulation of
IGFBP5 is at least partially responsible for stromal cellmediated fulvestrant resistance.

that of IGFBP5 (Figure 6A, 6C) and showed an inverse
correlation to that of Bcl-3 (Figure 6B, 6D). As a control
we used KLK11. This stromal cell-regulated gene was
neither affected by siIGFBP5 nor by siBcl-3 (Table 1).
Nor did the expression of this gene show any correlation
with the expression of IGFBP5 or Bcl-3 (Figure 6E, 6F).
These data suggest that two MSC/CAF-regulated
genes, KLHL4 and SEPP1, are inversely regulated by
IGFBP5 and Bcl-3.

Downregulation of IGFBP5 has an impact on the
expression of stromal cell-regulated genes
We next sought to identify stromal cell-regulated
MCF-7 cell genes that are inversely regulated by IGFBP5
and Bcl-3. For this reason, we performed two sets of
independent cRNA microarray experiments comparing
the transcripts of MCF-7/MSC co-cultures (ratio: 50
to  1) with those in MCF-7 cells alone. The expression
of a total of 253 mRNA species was changed by ≥2-fold
in the presence of MSCs (Supplementary Table S2). Of
these, 18 mRNA species showed reduced expression in
the MCF-7/MSC co-cultures. The much higher number
of upregulated RNA species could at least partly be
explained by the presence of MSC-derived RNAs, such
as PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1)-specific,
ZEB-1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1)-specific
or CD90-specific RNAs, that are strongly expressed
in MSCs, but weakly or not expressed in MCF-7 cells
(data not shown). For further analysis, we focussed on
the RNAs that showed lower expression in the MCF-7/
MSC co-cultures, since, in theory, they should derive from
MCF-7 cells. Of the 18 downregulated mRNA species, 17
coded for known genes. For 13 of these 17 genes MSCdependent changes could be confirmed by Q-RT-PCR
assays. Of these 13 genes, two genes (CDSN and CALCR)
showed very low expression and were therefore excluded
from further analysis. The remaining 11 genes are listed
in Table 1. Nine of these genes were also downregulated
in MCF-7/MSC co-cultures when cells were kept in 3D
suspension cultures that led to spheroid formation. Ten
of these genes showed also reduced expression in MCF7/MSC co-cultures when MSCs and MCF-7 cells were
separated by a 0.4 μm filter that prevented direct cell-cell
contact, but allowed paracrine effects. MSC-CM induced
the level of nine of these genes, while CAF-CM reduced
the expression of all eleven genes. Interestingly, most of
these genes were also responsive to insulin and CoCl2.
Collectively, these data suggest that these eleven
genes are regulated by MSCs and CAFs through soluble
factors that these stromal cells secret, just as was found for
the stroma cell-mediated regulation of IGFBP5 and Bcl-3.
Examining the expression of these genes in the
presence of siIGFBP5 and siBcl3, we found that two
genes (SEPP1 and KLHL4) were inversely regulated
by siIGFBP5 and siBcl3. Like stromal cells, siIGFBP5
significantly downregulated the expression of these two
genes, while siBcl3 upregulated their levels. Moreover,
the expression of KLHL4 and SEPP1 correlated well with

Stromal cell-induced downregulation of IGFBP5
in other breast cancer cells
We next examined whether stromal cells may be
able to modulate signal pathway activities and protein
expression also in other ERα-positive breast cancer cell
lines (BT474 and T47D) in a similar way as in MCF-7
cells and whether they may also affect cell growth in the
presence of fulvestrant. As seen with MCF-7 cells, BT474
cells responded to CAF-CM by a significant decrease in
the IGFBP5 RNA expression and a significant rise in the
Bcl-3 RNA level (Figure 7A). CAF-CM also increased
Bcl-3 protein expression and upregulated the levels of the
P-AKT and P-STAT3 (Figure 7B). However, in contrast to
MCF-7 cells, BT474 cells failed to increase the expression
of integrin β1 and IGF1R in response to CAF-CM. Of
note, insulin also failed to increase the integrin β1 level
in BT474 cells (data not shown). By being much higher in
BT474 cells than in MCF-7 cells, the level of integrin β1
may have already reached its maximum value in its basal
state. It is also noteworthy that the CAIX protein could not
be detected by Western blot analysis, even when cells were
treated with CoCl2 (data not shown). In an ATP-based
growth assay, CAF-CM significantly promoted BT474
growth in the presence of fulvestrant, though the effect
was less pronounced than that seen with MCF-7 cells.
Importantly, no effect of CAF-CM could be observed on
BT474 cell growth in the absence of this drug (Figure 7C).
Of note, clonogenic assay could not be performed with
BT474 cells, since BT474 cells did not survive when
seeded at low density.
Collectively, these data indicate that BT474 cells
behave similar to MCF-7 cells in terms of their responses
to CAF-CM. Like MCF-7 cells, BT474 cells show higher
growth activity in the presence of fulvestrant, lower
expression of IGFBP5, higher levels of Bcl-3 and an
increase in the PI3K/AKT pathway activity suggesting
that CAF-CM induces these changes in both cell lines
through the same mechanism.
In contrast to BT474 and MCF-7 cells, T47D cells
were quite unresponsive to CAF-CM in terms of changes
in protein expression and pathway activities (Figure
7D, 7E). CAF-CM only increased the P-STAT3 levels
in T47D cells (Figure 7E). Of note, Bcl-3 protein could
not be detected (data not shown). To check whether the
PI3K/AKT and HIF1α/CAIX pathways are functional in

T47D cells, we treated these cells with insulin and CoCl2.
Insulin and CoCl2 were able to raise the P-AKT level or
CAIX level, respectively, (Figure 7F) demonstrating that
the failure of CAF-CM to induce insulin- and CoCl2-like
effects in T47D cells was not due to unresponsiveness of
the PI3K/AKT and HIF1α/CAIX pathways. In ATP- and
colony growth assays, CAF-CM showed a promoting
effect on T47D cell growth irrespective of whether
fulvestrant was present or not (Figure 7G, 7H).
The data obtained with T47D cells suggest that the
responses of ERα-positive breast cancer cells to stromal
cells can differ.

of these agents. We present evidence that stromal cells
induce all of these changes by downregulating IGFBP5
expression. Downregulation of IGFBP5 also contributed
to the activation of STAT3. It seems therefore that, by
downregulating IGFBP5, MSCs and CAFs coordinately
induce a wide range of changes in breast cancer cells.
Since some changes as induced by IGFBP5
downregulation could be mimicked by insulin, some by
CoCl2 and others neither by insulin nor CoCl2, it is likely
that IGFBP5 fulfills several different functions in breast
cancer cells. Besides its classical function as a regulator
of IGF-dependent IGF1R activation [44], IGF1Rindependent actions of IGFBP5 have been described [19].
E.g., it has been shown that, by binding to integrin α2/
β1, IGFBP5 is able to regulate cell adhesion, migration
and survival of MCF-7 cells [20]. This activity did not
require the N-terminal domain, which is responsible for
its IGF1R-depending action, but the C-terminal domain,
which interacts with heparin. The notion that the N- and
C-terminal domains of IGFBP5 have different functions is
also supported by a study that showed that the N-terminal
domain blocks proliferation of osteosarcoma cells and
induces apoptosis, whereas the C-terminal domain inhibits
migration and invasion [45]. In addition, the C-terminal
domain contains a nuclear localization sequence allowing
IGFBP5 to fulfill functions in the nucleus [46]. IGF1Rindependent functions of IGFBP5 have also been found invivo studies [47] just further substantiating the hypothesis
that at least two independent activities of IGFBP5 exist.
Downregulation of IGFBP5 by siIGFBP5 resulted in
increased cellular growth both in the presence and absence
of fulvestrant. The effect of siIGFBP5 on cell growth in
the absence of fulvestrant could be mediated by its insulinlike effect on P-AKT, since insulin was able to foster cell
growth in absence, but not in the presence of fulvestrant.
The effect of siIGFBP5 on cell growth in the presence of
fulvestrant is likely mediated by upregulation of Bcl-3
expression, since siBcl-3 specifically attenuated cellular
growth in the presence of fulvestrant, while showing
no effect on growth in its absence. Hence, Bcl-3 may
protect ERα-positive breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7
cells, against fulvestrant. In line with this hypothesis, a
previous study on MCF-7 cells grown in ovariectomized
mice showed that estrogen deficiency was linked to higher
Bcl-3 expression [28]. In this study, along with the higher
expression of Bcl-3, a higher DNA-binding activity of
NFκB was observed. By binding to p50/p50 and p52/
p52 NFκB homodimers, Bcl-3 is thought to increase
NFκB activity [27]. Thus, by upregulating Bcl-3 levels in
ERα-positive breast cancer cells, MSCs and CAFs may
pave the way towards an NFκB-dependent growth under
conditions where ERα is not functional. Interestingly,
NFκB activation does not only protect against loss of
ERα function, but also promotes growth of Her2-positive
breast cancer cells in the presence of a Her2 inhibitor [48]
suggesting that NFκB activation is a general option for

The expression of Bcl-3 is associated with
an unfavorable outcome of endocrinally treated
breast cancer patients with ERα/
PR-positive tumors
We next sought to analyze whether Bcl-3 is
associated with the outcome of breast cancer patients
that suffered from ERα/PR-positive tumors and received
endocrine treatment. For this reason, we performed an
in-silico analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier-Plotter
available
under
http://kmplot.com/analysis/index.
php?p=service&default=true which is based on data
published by Gyorffy et al. [43]. The selected criteria
(ERα+/PR+/received endocrine treatment) were met by
a cohort of 229 patients. The analysis for this cohort
revealed that higher Bcl-3 mRNA levels were significantly
associated with a more unfavorable relapse-free survival
(Figure 8A). We also run the analysis for KLHL4 and
SEPP1, whose expression could be increased by siBcl-3
and showed an inverse correlation to that of Bcl-3. For
these two genes, higher mRNA levels correlated with
a better relapse-free survival (Figure 8B, 8C). While
the data for KLHL4 slightly missed the significance
level (p = 0.051) (Figure 8B), those for SEPP1 were
highly significant (Figure 8C). Collectively, these data
are consistent with the notion that Bcl-3 is involved in
endocrine resistance and that KLHL4 and SEPP1 are
negatively regulated by Bcl-3. The data might also suggest
that Bcl-3 mediates endocrine resistance at least partially
by downregulating KLHL4 and SEPP1.

DISCUSSION
The data presented here show that MSCs and CAFs
affect ERα-positive breast cancer cells in a similar way.
They promote cellular growth in the presence of the
anti-estrogen fulvestrant and change the activities of
the same signaling pathways and the expression of the
same proteins. Most of the changes in signaling pathway
activities and protein expression could be recapitulated
by combined treatment with insulin and CoCl2. Only
stromal cell-induced changes in IGF1R and Bcl-3
expression could not be mimicked by a combination

breast cancer cells to survive under conditions where the
major growth-permitting pathway is blocked. In line with
this notion, ERα-negative breast cancer cells are found to
be more dependent on NFκB activity for proliferation than
ERα-positive cells [49].
We could show that stromal cell-induced
downregulation of IGFBP5 expression and concomitant
upregulation of Bcl-3, IGF1R and P-AKT levels is not
only seen with MCF-7 cells, but also with BT474 cells.
This suggests that the observed changes as inflicted by
stromal cells are not limited to a specific cell line, but
of greater importance. On the other hand, the failure of
T47D cells to react this way upon exposure to stromal
cells indicates that breast cancer cells do not necessarily
respond to stromal cells by inducing changes in IGFBP5
and Bcl-3 expression. T47D cells expressed Bcl-3 protein
at non-detectable level as judged by Western blot analysis.
Hence, it is unlikely that Bcl-3 is involved in fulvestrant
resistance developed by T47D cells. In agreement with
this notion, recent data showed that T47D cells activate
Aurora kinase B to gain fulvestrant resistance [50].
How stromal cells downregulate IGFBP5 expression
in breast cancer cells has still to be determined. IGFBP5
expression has been reported to be positively regulated
by STAT3 in fibroblasts [51]. However, we did not find
an effect of siSTAT3 on the IGFBP5 level in MCF-7
cells (Figure 4A). Nor did siSTAT3 prevent the stromal
cell-induced effects on signaling pathways and protein
expression (Figure 2E). Hence, interleukin-6, the major
stromal-cell secreted stimulator of STAT3 activity
[52, 53], is unlikely to be responsible for IGFBP5
downregulation and its consequences. We also tested
SDF-1 (stromal cell derived factor-1) and other cytokines,
known to be secreted by stromal cells, for their ability
to downregulate IGFBP5, but so far we did not see any
effect. MSCs and CAFs also secret high amounts of PAI1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) (data not shown).
This protease inhibitor has several functions, including
a critical role in migration [54], which links this protein
to cancer progression [55]. To analyze its importance
for the stromal cell-induced effects, we eliminated PAI1 from CAF-CM by transfecting CAFs with a PAI-1specific siRNA, but did not find any evidence that this
treatment changes the ability of CAF-CM to induce
IGFBP5 downregulation in MCF-7 cells (data not shown).
Besides secreted proteins, microvesicles (exosomes and
shedding vesicles) as released by MSCs and CAFs [56,
57], might be responsible for the induction of IGFBP5
downregulation. In terms of shedding vesicles, we could
confirm that they are released by MSCs (data not shown).
We are currently studying their potential role in stromal
cell-induced IGFBP5 downregulation.
By a comparative gene expression analysis of
MCF-7 cells grown alone or in the presence of MSCs
we identified a number of genes whose expression is
downregulated in response to MSCs and CAFs. The
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels of approximately half of these genes were also
decreased by siIGFBP5. Of these genes, KLHL4 and
SEPP1 were upregulated by siBcl3. The expression of
these two genes changed along with the level of IGFBP5
in a linear fashion and inversely along with that of Bcl3.
This suggests that KLHL4 and SEPP1 can be regulated
through the IGFBP5/Bcl-3 axis. Interestingly, treatment of
MCF-7 cells with TNFα, which stimulates NFκB activity,
was found to downregulate SEPP1 [58] suggesting that
SEPP1 is an NFκB/Bcl-3 target at least in MCF-7 cells.
However, since downregulation of SEPP1 expression
could also be induced by insulin and CoCl2, NFκB/Bcl3 may act in concert with HIF1α and the PI3K/AKT
pathway, all activated by stromal cell-induced IGFBP5
downregulation. One way by which the PI3K/AKT
pathway could downregulate SEPP1 expression is by
inhibiting the activity of the forkhead box transcription
factor FoxO1A [59–61], a tumor suppressor protein shown
to activate SEPP1 transcription in hepatoma cells [59].
Interestingly, in in-silico survival analysis, we found a
correlation of higher Bcl-3 expression and lower KLHL4
and SEPP1 expression with unfavorable outcome of
endocrinally treated breast cancer patients that suffered
from a ERα+/PR+-tumor suggesting that not only Bcl-3
is linked to endocrine resistance, but also its target genes
KLHL4 and SEPP1.
In conclusion, our results suggest that MSCs and
CAFs are able to trigger downregulation of IGFBP5
expression in ERα-positive breast cancer cells, such as
MCF-7 cells, and, as a consequence, induce a number
of changes in signaling pathway activities and gene
expression (summarized in Figure 9). One of these
changes, the upregulation of Bcl-3 expression, is at least
partly responsible for the promoting effect of MSCs and
CAFs on the cellular growth in the presence of fulvestrant.
Our data also show that, even within the subgroup of
ERα-positive breast cancer, cancer cells may or may not
respond to MSCs and CAFs by downregulating IGFBP5
expression indicating that ERα-positive breast cancers are
a heterogeneous group also in respect to their interactions
with stromal cells.
Since Bcl-3 expression could be linked to
unfavorable prognosis of breast cancer patients that
received endocrine treatment, Bcl-3 may be a suitable
biomarker for predicting endocrine therapy response of
patients with ERα-/PR-positive breast cancers.

Figure 9: Proposed mechanism of stromal cell induced fulvestrant resistance. Factor(s) secreted by MSCs and CAFs lead to

a decline in the IGFBP5 expression. The reduced IGFBP5 level results in the release of IGFs from the IGF/IGFBP5 complex allowing IGF
to activate IGF1R, thereby activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Besides blocking IGF activity by this IGF-dependent function,
IGFBP5 also shows IGF-independent actions (e.g. as an intracellular protein). Through this IGF-independent action IGFBP5 likely keeps
Bcl-3 expression down. Consequently, when stromal cells downregulate IGFBP5 expression the Bcl-3 expression raises. This leads to
fulvestrant resistance and to changes in the expression of the Bcl-3 target genes IGF1R , KLHL4 and SEPP1.

(FCS, Pan Biotech) in the absence of antibiotics. Human
MSCs were kindly provided by J. Lützkendorf and L.
Müller. MSCs were isolated from human bone marrow and
propagated as described [35]. Breast cancer cell lines and
stromal cells were maintained in the same batch of serum.
To obtain conditioned medium (CM) from CAFs (CAFCM), cells were kept at 100% confluency for three days.
For MSC-CM, MSCs were kept at ~50% confluency for
three days (to prevent differentiation). To remove floating
cells and debris, CMs were centrifuged at 3000 rpm in
a Multifuge 3 (Heraeus) for 10 minutes. Unless stated

otherwise, for treatment with stromal cell CM, MSC- or
CAF-CM was mixed with growth medium 1+4, referred as
20% MSC-CM or 20% CAF-CM, respectively. Cells were
incubated with CM for 3 days. Co-culture experiments
were performed by mixing MCF-7 cells with MSCs in a
ratio of 10:1 or 50:1. In transwell experiments, MSCs were
separated from MCF-7 cells by a 0.4 μm pore membrane
(Greiner) with the MCF-7 cells grown on the bottom of the
well of a 6-well-plate and the MSCs attached to the upper
side of the membrane. Spheroid assays were performed
as described [35]. Based on data reported by Kirkegaard

Growth assays

et al. [64] cell were incubated with fulvestrant at a final
concentrations of 100 nM. Insulin, PQ401 and CoCl2 were
added to cells at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml (~90 μIU/
ml, as determined by insulin ELISA, Hölzel Diagnostika),
10 μM and 100 μM, respectively.
For spheroid formation in 3D suspension cultures,
cells were incubated on a layer of 2% Seakem GTG
agarose (dissolved in PBS) in 96-well plates at a density
of 5 × 103 cells/well for 3–4 days in the presence of
fulvestrant and/or CAF-CM or in the absence of both
agents. To measure the spheroid size, a picture was taken
by an AxioCam MRc 5 camera and the area displayed on
this picture measured by AxioVision R 4.5 software as
described previously [65].

To determine cell growth of individual clones,
cells were trypsinized, counted and seeded on a 10 cm
(Æ) petri dish (3 × 104 cells per dish) in 10 ml growth
medium. Cells were then incubated with MSC-CM,
CAF-CM or insulin and/or fulvestrant or left untreated
for five days. Cell growth of individual clones were
determined by measuring the size of each clone by using
an AxioCAM MRc5 camera and the AxioVision R 4.5
imaging software (Zeiss). Single cells were not counted.
For each condition, at least fifty individual clones were
randomly chosen and measured. In RNA interference
experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA and
incubated for two days before the clonogenic assay was
started.
To examine cell growth activity at higher cell
density an ATP-based assay (Vialight Plus Kit, Lonza)
was used. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 or 3
× 104 per well of a 24-well plate and incubated for 5 to 7
days in the presence of fulvestrant and/or CAF-CM or in
the absence of both. After removal of the growth medium,
cells were washed once with PBS and lysed by adding a
mixture of 100 μl PBS and 50 μl lysis buffer. Cell lysates
were cleared by microfugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min.
After 75 μl of the cleared lysate was mixed with 50 μl
luciferase stock solution, the mixture was incubated for
2 min at RT and luciferase activity measured in a Sirius
luminometer (Berthold).

Antibodies and reagents
For Western blot analysis, the following antibodies
were used (working dilutions are given in brackets).
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies: anti-P(S473)-AKT (1:2000,
D9E, Cell Signaling), anti-Bcl-3 (1:1000, C-14, Santa
Cruz), anti-P(Thr202, Tyr204)-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2
(both 1:2000, Cell Signaling), anti-ERα (1:2000, Santa
Cruz, HC-20), anti-IGF1Rβ (1:2000, Cell Signaling),
anti-P(Tyr705)-STAT3 (1:1000, D3A7, Cell Signaling)
and anti-STAT3 (1:1000, 79D7, Cell Signaling); rabbit
monoclonal antibodies: anti-integrin β1 (1:2000,
EPR1040Y, Abcam), anti-GAPDH (1:5000, Ambion)
and Ki67 (1: 2000, Epitomics, clone EPR3610); mouse
monoclonal antibodies: anti-(pan)AKT (1:1000, 40D4,
Cell Signaling), anti-E-cadherin (1:5000, BD Transduction
Lab.) and anti-HIF1α (1:1000, BD Transduction Lab.).
Anti-CAIX was kindly provided by S. Pastorekova.
Secondary antibody conjugates (anti-rabbit/anti-mouse
horse radish peroxidase, 1:2000) were purchased from
Cell Signaling.
Fulvestrant (LKT Laboratories) was purchased from
Biomol (Hamburg/Germany), PQ404 from Calbiochem
and recombinant human insulin was from Sigma-Aldrich.

Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative
(Q) PCR were carried out as described [66], except
that  the RNA isolation kit was from Roche and the
dNTP mix was from Qiagen. Briefly, cDNA synthesis
was done by using Superscript II (Invitrogen) by
starting from 1 μg total RNA. For Q-PCR, ABsolute
QPCR SYBR Green Fluorescein Mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Biosciences) was used. PCRs were run in a
BioRAD iCycler. Results were analyzed by iQ5 Optical
System software version 2.1. Relative RNA levels of
genes were calculated by the comparative Ct (2−∆∆Ct)
method by using GAPDH and HPRT as reference genes
for normalization. The primers used for Q-PCR are
listed in Supplementary Table S1.

RNA interference
Small interference (si)RNAs were purchased
from Eurofins MWG. Transfection was performed by
electroporation as described [66]. Briefly, cells were
trypsinized, washed once in RPMI medium, electroporated
by using a Bio-Rad GenePulserX-Cell at 250 V and 800 μF
and kept on ice for 30 min. Cells were then transferred
to a 6 or 10 cm (Æ) culture dish and incubated for two
days to allow the siRNA to downregulate the expression
of its target. The effect of the siRNA was confirmed by
Western blot and/or Q-RT-PCR analysis. The following
siRNAs (sense-strand) were used: siBcl3 (5′-UGG UCU
UCU CUC CGC AUC A-3′), siLuc (5′-CUU ACG CUG
AGU ACU UCG A-3′), siIGFBP5 (5′-GCA GAU CUG
UGA AUA UGA A-3′) and siSTAT3 (5′-GAA UCA CGC
CUU CUA CAG A-3′).

cRNA microarray analysis
In two independent experiments, 5 × 105 MCF-7
cells were seeded into the well of a 6-well plate alone
or together with 1 × 104 MSCs and grown for two days
before total RNA was isolated. After the RNA was qualitychecked by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, gene expression
analyses were performed by Miltenyi Biotec by using
Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays
8  × 60K. Briefly, cRNAs were generated from 100 ng

Protein extraction and western blot analysis
Protein extractions from the membraneous,
cytosolic and nuclear fractions and Western blot analysis
were carried out as described [66]. Briefly, after having
been scraped off the plate, cells were centrifuged and
resuspended in 400 μl buffer A (10 mM HEPES (pH
7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA) and
passed through a 20-gauge needle. Stepwise centrifugation
at 3000, 6500 and 13000 rpm in a microfuge was used
to obtain cytosolic, nuclear and membraneous protein
fractions. For nuclear or membraneous protein extraction,
the pellet was extracted in buffer C (20 mM HEPES
(pH 7.9), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
1 mM DTT) or buffer D (5 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mM
K-EDTA (pH 7.2), 1 mM DTT), respectively. For HIF1α
detection, whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared as
described [67]. Briefly, depending on cell density, cell
layers were incubated with 100–300 μl ice-cold RIPA
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% TritonX-100, 0.25%
deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail
(1:100) (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340) for 20 min and scraped
off from the plate. Lysates were cleared by microfugation
at full speed for 10 min.
Ten μg protein of each sample was separated on a
10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF
membrane (Millipore). After blocking the membrane in
2% skim milk (Applichem) dissolved in washing buffer
(10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA),
it was sequentially incubated with the primary antibody
and the secondary antibody in washing buffer containing
0.2% skim milk. Peroxidase activity was visualized by
chemoluminescence using ECLPlus and Hyperfilm ECL
(GE Healthcare).
