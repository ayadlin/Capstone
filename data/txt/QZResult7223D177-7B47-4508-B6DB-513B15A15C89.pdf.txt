BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence from observational studies has suggested that metformin may be beneficial in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, to the authors’ knowledge, none of these studies was conducted in a US population.
Because environmental factors such as Western diet and obesity are implicated in the causation of CRC, a large case-control study
was performed to assess the effects of metformin on the incidence of CRC in a US population. METHODS: MarketScan databases
were used to identify diabetic patients with CRC. A case was defined as having an incident diagnosis of CRC. Up to 2 controls
matched for age, sex, and geographical region were selected for each case. Metformin exposure was assessed by prescription tracking within the 12-month period before the index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for multiple potential confounders and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs). RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 55 years and 57 years,
respectively, in the control and case groups (P 5 1.0). Approximately 60% of the study participants were male and 40% were female
in each group. In the multivariable model, any metformin use was associated with a 15% reduction in the odds of CRC (AOR, 0.85;
95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.95 [P 5.007]). After adjusting for health care use, the beneficial effect of metformin was reduced to
12% (AOR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.00 [P 5.05]). The dose-response analyses demonstrated no significant association
with metformin dose, duration, or total exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of

INTRODUCTION
Cancer and diabetes are extremely prevalent diseases worldwide and are associated with substantial adverse health effects.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in females and the third most commonly diagnosed
cancer in males. Over 1.2 million incident cases and 608,700 deaths were recorded globally in 2008.1 At least 6 case-control
studies and 9 cohort studies to date have suggested that the relative risk of CRC is higher in patients with diabetes (predominantly type 2).2 A recent consensus statement by the American Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that there is a higher risk of CRC among patients with type 2 diabetes.3 Diabetes is believed to promote the
development of carcinogenesis through complex processes. These include hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and chronic
inflammation.3 Metformin is the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. An important clue to the actions of metformin was the discovery that metformin upregulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),4
which is a central regulator of cellular energy metabolism. Subsequent epidemiological studies linked metformin use to an
anticancer effect,5 which has led to great interest in repurposing metformin for cancer treatment and prevention.
Metformin is a generic, inexpensive, easily available drug that belongs to the biguanide class of agents. Its excellent
safety profile makes it an attractive anticancer drug. Metformin is mainly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus
but is also used in patients with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) and morbid obesity. Metformin causes its antihyperglycemic action by suppressing hepatic glucose output (inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis), thereby increasing
peripheral tissue (skeletal muscle and adipocytes) insulin sensitivity and decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose.6

Original Article

Metformin is usually well tolerated with infrequent gastrointestinal adverse effects such as diarrhea, flatulence,
and abdominal discomfort reported to be the major side
effects.7 Hypoglycemia is rare,8 and lactic acidosis is
extremely rare (0.03 cases per 1000 patient-years).6
There have been several observational studies from
Europe and Asia suggesting a reduced incidence of CRC as
well as other cancers including breast, lung, prostate, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer in patients with diabetes who are
being treated with metformin.9-13 Supporting these observations in humans, metformin has been shown to inhibit
growth and induce apoptosis in cell lines and animal models
for various cancers, including CRC.14,15 A recent prospective, randomized, clinical trial demonstrated a decrease in
the mean number of aberrant cryptic foci (a putative precursor lesion for CRC) in nondiabetic patients after 30 days of
treatment with metformin compared with placebo.16 There
is a growing body of evidence indicating that metformin’s
anticancer activity is mediated by both its cellular and systemic effects.17 The systemic effects of metformin are
mainly reductions in hyperglycemia that can potentially
counteract the Warburg effect (dependence of cancer cells
on glucose as predominant source of energy). The cellular
or direct effects are believed to involve activation of the
AMPK pathway,18-20 which can potentially counteract the
effects of hyperinsulinemia by systemic inhibition of growth
factors including glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF-1), IGF-1 receptor, IGF-binding protein, and leptin
(but an increase in adiponectin), eventually leading to the
inhibition of protein synthesis and reductions in cell growth
and proliferation.
Despite these observational studies and rationale, we
know of no large, retrospective, nationwide studies performed in the US population that examined metformin’s
potential effectiveness in reducing the incidence of CRC.
Furthermore, because environmental factors, especially
Western diet and obesity, are believed to play important
causal roles in the genesis of sporadic colon cancer, such a
study in a US population is warranted to address the
potential efficacy of metformin in this country.21 Therefore, we conducted a case-control study using the MarketScan databases to address this question in a US
population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Eligibility Criteria

The study was conducted using the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (Truven Health
Analytics, Ann Arbor, Mich). MarketScan is a longitudi1072

nal database that contains individual-level, deidentified
health insurance claims data from nearly 150 million individuals from all geographic areas of the United States. All
patients aged >18 years with diabetes mellitus who were
diagnosed with CRC from 2005 through 2010 were identified in the MarketScan database using International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) codes (diabetes mellitus: ICD-9 codes
250.0-250.9 and CRC: ICD-9 codes 153.0-153.9, 154.0,
154.1, and 154.8). To reduce the false-positive rate of
CRC cases, only patients with at least 2 claims of ICD-9
codes indicating CRC on different dates within a period
of 3 months were included. In addition, only patients
with continuous enrollment in the 12-month period
before the earliest CRC diagnosis date were included in
the current study to ensure completeness of the claims
data. The primary objective of the study was to assess the
odds of developing CRC among metformin users and
nonusers. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Chicago.
Cases and Controls

A case was defined as a patient with diabetes who had an
incident diagnosis of CRC. For the purpose of the current
study, a CRC case was considered to be incident if there
were no claims indicative of CRC in the previous year so
as to ensure metformin use before the development of
CRC. A control was defined as a patient with diabetes
without a diagnosis of CRC. The controls were identified
by first matching patients by age, sex, and geographical
region (ie, Northeast, North Central, South, West, and
unknown region) to a case, then by ascertaining those that
were enrolled within the same month as the month of diagnosis of the matching case, and finally by retaining only
those patients with 12-month continuous enrollment as
controls. Therefore, up to 2 controls individually matched
for age, sex, and geographical region were selected per
case.
Exposure Ascertainment

The exposure to metformin was estimated by tracking the
prescriptions within the 12 months before the index date.
The index date for cases was defined as the earliest date of
CRC diagnosis. Similarly, the index date for controls was
defined as the date of diagnosis of the case that was used to
find the matched controls. We gathered the dose and duration of metformin use for each study participant. The
exposure assessment in the year before the CRC diagnosis
ensured the inclusion of only incident cases of CRC to the
best extent possible for the current study.

Potential Confounders

We collected data regarding multiple potential confounders of patient-related variables and concurrent medications 12 months before the index date. The patientrelated variables for this purpose included obesity (ICD-9
codes 278.00 and 278.01), PCOD (ICD-9 code 256.4),
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (ICD-9 codes 556.0556.9, 555.0-555.2, and 555.9), coronary artery disease
(CAD) (ICD-9 codes 410.0-410.9, 414.0-414.4, 414.8,
414.9, and 429.2), age, sex, geographic region, and
comorbidity scores. The comorbidity scores were calculated using the modified Charlson algorithm available
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End ResultsMedicare Web site22 and revised to fit the data structure
in MarketScan. Medications being used concurrently
within the last year (including the index date) for which
statistical model adjustments were made included prescribed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

outpatient visits and the number of hospitalizations during the 12 months before the index date.
Statistical Analyses

The differences between the case and control groups with
regard to covariates were determined using the chi-square
or Student t test. In the primary analyses, the odds of
developing CRC for patients with diabetes who were
exposed to metformin and those not exposed to metformin was calculated. Conditional logistic regression was
used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), adjusting for patientrelated variables, concomitant medications, and health

care use. In the secondary analyses, we calculated the magnitude of effect of the dose, duration, and total exposure
of metformin on CRC risk. To study dose-response relationships, we collected data regarding the dose and duration of metformin for the study participants with at least 1
prescription claim for metformin within the past year. We
divided the duration of use into 4 quartiles (123 days,
124-240 days, 241-313 days, and 314 days) for statistical analyses. Similarly, the daily dose of metformin was divided into 4 quartiles (1000 mg, 1001-1500 mg, 15012000 mg, and 2001 mg) for statistical analyses. We also
calculated the total metformin exposure by multiplying
the metformin dose with duration of use. A P value was
considered to be statistically significant if the 2-sided P
value was .05. The data management was performed
using SAS statistical software (version 5.1; SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC) and all statistical analyses were performed
using STATA statistical software (version 12.0; StataCorp
LP, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Study Participants

The total number of study participants was 8046, with
2682 patients in the case group and 5364 individuals in the
control group. The mean age was 57 years and 55 years,
respectively, in the case and control groups (P 5 1.0).
There were 60% males and 40% females in each group.
Any metformin exposure was noted in 36.6% of patients in
the case group and 38.4% of those in the control group,
respectively. On univariate analysis, there were no significant differences observed in terms of age; sex; geographical
region; year of diagnosis; obesity; presence of PCOD; and
use of statins, metformin, SUs, TZD, and insulin. However, comorbidities, including IBD and CAD, and
NSAIDs use were significantly different between the 2
groups, with higher percentages noted in the case group
compared with the control group with the exception of
NSAID use (Table 1). The Charlson comorbidity index
was significantly higher in the control group but the number of hospital admissions and outpatient visits were significantly higher in the case group compared with controls
(Table 1).
Metformin and Odds of Developing CRC

In a multivariate model, any metformin use was associated
with a 15% reduced odds of CRC (AOR, 0.85; 95% CI,
0.76-0.95 [P 5 .007]) while controlling for all the patientrelated variables, concomitant medications, and Charlson
comorbidity index (Table 2). We found that PCOD, obesity, and use of statins and TZD demonstrated no

significant association with the odds of developing CRC,
whereas the Charlson comorbidity index and prescribed
NSAIDs were associated with a significantly decreased
odds of developing CRC. IBD, use of SUs, CAD, use of insulin, number of hospital admissions, and number of outpatient visits were associated with a significantly increased
odds of developing CRC (Table 2). Adjustment for health
care use in the multivariate model (besides all other covariates) resulted in 12% reduced odds of CRC with any metformin use (AOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00 [P 5.05])
compared with no metformin use (Table 3).
Dose-Response Analysis With Metformin

The mean and median duration of metformin intake was
218 days and 240 days, respectively. The mean and median metformin daily dose taken by study participants
was 1500 mg, whereas the mean and median metformin
total dose taken by study participants was 3,29,300 mg
and 3,02,000 mg, respectively. However, no significant
dose-response relationship was found between metformin dose, duration, or total exposure (dose 3 duration)
and odds of developing CRC (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
There is growing interest in exploring the role of metformin as a chemopreventive agent given the experimental
evidence in support of metformin as an anticancer
drug.15,23 In a large case-control study of patients with
diabetes, we found a 12% to 15% statistically significantly reduced risk of developing CRC with any metformin use. However, the dose-response analyses did not
demonstrate any significant relationship between dose,
duration, or total exposure of metformin and CRC.
Although a clear dose-response effect would have
Cancer

April 1, 2015

strengthened the findings of the current study, the lack
of a dose-response effect might be due to a threshold
effect achieved at the lowest dose. In this regard, Lee
et al, in another epidemiological study, found a
significantly reduced CRC risk at all dose levels of metformin (500 mg, 500-1000 mg, and 1000 mg) in female
metformin users (but not in male users).9 Similarly,
Tseng reported that the beneficial effect of metformin
becomes significant only after 3 years of use.24
We believe the current study is unique because to our
knowledge there are no prior studies to date addressing the
effectiveness of metformin in reducing the risk of CRC
among patients with diabetes in a US population. This population, moreover, has relatively distinct environmental risk
factors, especially Western diet and obesity. In addition, the
patient population in the current study was relatively
younger (median age of approximately 59 years; range, 1864 years) compared with median age at the time of CRC diagnosis in the United States (approximately 68 years).25 The
population of the current study was also relatively younger
compared with previously published studies (Table 5).9-11,24
There has been a consistent association reported
between diabetes and many cancers, including colon
cancer. As noted above, the key mechanisms linked to
cancer in a diabetic patient population are hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and chronic inflammation.3 In
the current analyses, insulin use was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of developing
CRC (AOR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.27-1.65 [P<.001]),
which supports the hypothesis that insulin may be
increasing CRC risk by promoting signaling through
IGF receptors, resulting in increased cell growth, proliferation, survival, and migration. Similarly, SUs, which
act by promoting insulin secretion, were also found to

be associated with an increased risk of CRC (AOR,
1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.31 [P 5 .02]).
In addition to diabetes, other chronic diseases found
to be associated with a higher incidence of CRC were IBD
(AOR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.14-3.34 [P 5.01]) and CAD
(AOR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.43-1.93 [P<.001]). This finding
might be related to common risk factors as well as common pathological changes observed in these diseases (eg,
chronic inflammation in the colon in patients with IBD
and systemic inflammation among patients with CAD).
Although we expected to find a higher incidence of CRC
in individuals with obesity and PCOD, we did not find
any significant association, which might be due to the
unexpected underreporting of obesity (with a prevalence
of approximately 4%) and PCOD (prevalence of <1%)
in the current study data set. The influence of these
comorbidities should be considered in future studies using
data sets with adequate representation of individuals
affected with obesity and PCOD. Last, an enormous body
of evidence has suggested that the use of aspirin/NSAIDs
is associated with a reduced risk of developing CRC.26-28
We evaluated the effect of prescribed NSAIDs and found
a 16% decreased odds of developing CRC (AOR, 0.84;
95% CI, 0.73-0.96 [P 5.01]). To the best of our knowledge, only 2 other studies in the current metformin literature controlled for aspirin/NSAID use but found no
1076

statistically significant association.24,29 Similarly, statins
are believed to decrease the incidence of CRC due to several of their pleiotropic effects (most importantly antiinflammatory properties).30 Although not statistically
significant, we found that the use of statins was associated
with a 9% lower odds of developing CRC (AOR, 0.91;
95% CI, 0.82-1.01 [P 5 .10]).
The results of the current study are similar to the
results of several other observational studies that were
conducted using either the Health Information Network
database of the United Kingdom or the Taiwanese
National Health Insurance database. In these studies,
metformin was associated with a statistically significant
reduction of 27% to 44% in the incidence of CRC
(except for one study that reported a 64% reduction) (Table 5).9-11,24,29,31 Despite these positive studies, 2 nested
case-control studies using the UK General Practice
Research Database found no effect of metformin on
CRC risk (Table 5).9-11,24,29,31 However, 3 large metaanalyses, including case-control and cohort studies, have
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the
risk (approximately 32%-37%) of developing CRC in
individuals receiving metformin compared with those not
receiving metformin with mild to moderate heterogeneity
(I2 index, 24%-44%).32-34 Collectively, these numerous
positive observational studies and meta-analyses suggest
Cancer

Metformin and Colorectal Cancer/Sehdev et al

that metformin use is associated with a reduction in the
incidence of CRC. However, the magnitude of beneficial
effect noted in the current study is much smaller than
that of the meta-analyses. There are at least 2 possible factors that might have contributed to this finding. First, the
current study had a relatively younger population, which
may have resulted in missing some CRC cases because
the cancer incidence increases with age. Second, the current study was comprised of a relatively healthier population as evidenced by the lower Charlson comorbidity
index (mean of 1.1 in cases and 1.47 in controls), which
also could have resulted in the underdiagnosis of CRC.
We emphasize that the current study has many
strengths. First, the large sample size provided sufficient
power to address the impact of metformin use on the risk
of developing CRC. Second, a computerized prescription
database was used for assessing exposure to the drugs of interest, thereby minimizing recall bias. Third, several steps
were taken to avoid misclassification bias, such as using a
stringent case definition (as described earlier) and studying only those patients with at least 12 months of continuous enrollment before the date of diagnosis. Fourth, we
controlled for many potential confounders including diseases and concomitant medications during the 12 months
before the date of diagnosis. Fifth, we adjusted for health
care use by estimating the number of outpatient visits and
hospital admissions. Disparities in health care use can
induce a potential bias in a case-control study. For example, if patients in the case group are using more health care
resources compared with the control group, this can erroneously result in better outcomes being reported in the
case group. This was true in the current study because the
case group used more health care resources. Thus, the
beneficial effect of metformin was reduced when we
adjusted for health care use (Table 3).
The major limitation of the current study is its retrospective study design, which limits the ability to control
for unknown potential confounders and sometimes
known confounders when the data are not available (data
such as race and body mass index are not available in the
MarketScan databases). It is possible that such confounders have affected the current study results. First, we were
unable to control for aspirin use because this is mainly
available as an over-the-counter drug in the United States
and therefore this information was not available in the
MarketScan databases. It is theoretically possible that the
beneficial effect of metformin observed in the current
study is partially driven by the higher use of over-thecounter aspirin in the case group. Individuals with CAD
are more likely to take aspirin. The univariate analysis of
Cancer

April 1, 2015

the data from the current study does demonstrate a higher
rate of CAD in the case group, which could suggest that a
higher percentage of individuals in the case group might
be taking aspirin. However, because we adjusted for CAD
in our multivariate model, it is unlikely that the results of
the current study merely reflect potential confounding by
aspirin. Second, it is possible that a higher healthconscious behavior such as screening colonoscopy is associated with increased metformin use. Therefore, it is possible that the reduced incidence of CRC noted in the case
group is due to a greater likelihood of adhering to cancer
screening guidelines among metformin users. However,
we could not adjust for screening colonoscopy in the current study because the guideline-recommended screening
interval for colonoscopy is every 5 to 10 years, and given
our study duration of only 1 year, we would have missed
many screening colonoscopies outside of our observation
period. However, we did adjust for overall health care use,
which indicated a higher rate of use of health care resources in the case group compared with the control group,
which reduced the beneficial effect of metformin (AOR,
0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00 [P 5 .05]). Therefore, it is possible that the current study results of a beneficial effect of
metformin are in part due to greater health-conscious
behavior in the case group compared with the control
group. Third, we could not adjust for lifestyle (diet and
exercise) and socioeconomic factors in the current analysis. However, we do not expect that these variables would
be significantly different enough between the 2 groups to
explain the findings of the current study. In addition, we
matched for age, sex, geographical region, and year of diagnosis that would have balanced these factors between
the case and control groups. Fourth, we could not adjust
for smoking and alcohol consumption because this information is not available in the MarketScan databases. Last,
the data from the current study were not linked to cancer
registries and therefore there could be ascertainment bias
in the incident cohort as identified from claims using
ICD-9 codes.
The results of the current study suggest that metformin may have a beneficial effect in reducing the
risk of CRC among patients with diabetes in the US
population. The magnitude of the effect we measured
is smaller than that presented in prior studies from
Asia and Europe. This may reflect the relatively
younger population in the current study and differences in adjustments for potential confounders among
different studies. Furthermore, due to the inherent nature of the design of the current study, a causal relationship cannot be established. Furthermore,
