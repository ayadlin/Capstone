Abstract
Nutlin-3a is a small-molecule antagonist of p53/MDM2 that is being explored as a treatment for sarcoma. In
this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of sarcomas to Nutlin-3a. In an ex
vivo tissue explant system, we found that TP53 pathway alterations (TP53 status, MDM2/MDM4 genomic
ampliﬁcation/mRNA overexpression, MDM2 SNP309, and TP53 SNP72) did not confer apoptotic or cytostatic
responses in sarcoma tissue biopsies (n ¼ 24). Unexpectedly, MDM2 status did not predict Nutlin-3a sensitivity.
RNA sequencing revealed that the global transcriptomic proﬁles of these sarcomas provided a more robust
prediction of apoptotic responses to Nutlin-3a. Expression proﬁling revealed a subset of TP53 target genes that
were transactivated speciﬁcally in sarcomas that were highly sensitive to Nutlin-3a. Of these target genes, the
GADD45A promoter region was shown to be hypermethylated in 82% of wild-type TP53 sarcomas that did not
respond to Nutlin-3a, thereby providing mechanistic insight into the innate ability of sarcomas to resist apoptotic
death following Nutlin-3a treatment. Collectively, our ﬁndings argue that the existing benchmark biomarker for
MDM2 antagonist efﬁcacy (MDM2 ampliﬁcation) should not be used to predict outcome but rather global gene
expression proﬁles and epigenetic status of sarcomas dictate their sensitivity to p53/MDM2 antagonists. Cancer

Introduction
Sarcomas constitute a heterogeneous group of bone and
soft tissue malignancies that account for approximately
15% of all pediatric and 1% of all adult cancers (1). Many
sarcoma subtypes are resistant to cytotoxic agents and even
for those subtypes that are chemosensitive, long-term
responders are rarely seen due to cumulative toxicity and
a therapeutic ceiling that has now been reached. Overall 5Authors' Afﬁliations: 1Sarcoma Research Group, Discipline of Medicine,

year survival rates for patients diagnosed with soft-tissue
sarcomas remains at 60%, highlighting the pressing need for
new targeted systemic therapies particularly for those
patients with recurrent or advanced disease. In parallel
with this, new approaches to better understand the biologic
predictors of patient response to these agents is critical and
remains the key enabler for us to be able to move away from
empiricism to a more targeted approach. In essence, the
implementation of genetic markers into treatment practices
will allow us to match the correct drug with the right
patient.
Detailed molecular analysis of the oncogenic pathways
involved in sarcomagenesis has revealed that the integrity of
the p53 tumor suppressor protein and its downstream
pathways remain largely intact in the majority of sarcomas
(2). A mechanism commonly used by these malignancies to
subvert the antitumor activity of p53 during sarcomagenesis
and disease progression is through ampliﬁcation or overexpression of MDM2, the principal ubiquitin ligase for p53
(3, 4). Such characteristics suggest that sarcomas are ideal
candidates for therapies that inhibit MDM2, thus reactivating the p53 pathway to subsequently drive apoptosis. To
date, the most clinically advanced MDM2 antagonist is
Nutlin-3a (RG7112, Hoffmann La Roche). Identiﬁed by Vassilev and colleagues, this cis-imidazoline molecule blocks
the hydrophobic p53-binding pocket of MDM2, resulting
in rapid stabilization of the biologically active p53 protein
(5).

Pishas et al.

The importance of MDM2 in sarcomagenesis has emanated from the observation that its gene ampliﬁcation is
present in more than 90% of well-/de-differentiated liposarcomas (6). Promising results from preclinical studies have
shown that sarcoma cell lines with MDM2 ampliﬁcation are
more sensitive to Nutlin-3a than non–MDM2-ampliﬁed cell
lines (7, 8). Thus, it has been much anticipated to evaluate
the clinical efﬁcacy of targeting MDM2 in MDM2-ampliﬁed
sarcomas. One of the earliest clinical trials of Nutlin
(RG7112) was recently conducted in 20 patients with sarcomas highly enriched for MDM2 ampliﬁcation (well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma). Surprisingly, a poor clinical
response rate was observed, with only one patient achieving
a partial response (9). So, does this mean that MDM2
inhibition is not an attractive therapeutic approach, or
alternatively have we overestimated the role that MDM2
ampliﬁcation plays in the response to MDM2 antagonists? A
clear answer to this question will be critical as new MDM2
inhibitors in addition to Nutlin (RG7112, RG7388), such as
MI-773/SAR405838 (Sanoﬁ) and JNJ-26854165 (Johnson &
Johnson) enter phase I clinical testing (10–12).
Using primary human sarcoma tissue biopsies from a broad
range of sarcoma subtypes with varying MDM2 status; this
study has re-evaluated the capacity for MDM2 ampliﬁcation as
a biomarker to identify those patients with sarcoma most likely
to respond to Nutlin-3a. We conclusively show that MDM2
genomic ampliﬁcation is a remarkably poor predicator of
Nutlin-3a sensitivity and subsequently used transcriptomic
approaches to identify more robust biomarkers for MDM2
antagonists.

Materials and Methods
Clinical material
Tumor specimens were collected from patients with sarcoma (n ¼ 24) undergoing surgical resection/core biopsy at three
clinical institutions; Royal Adelaide Hospital, Calvary Wakeﬁeld Hospital, and St. Andrew's Hospital between 2010 and
2012. Written informed consent was obtained from each
patient (RAH Protocol #100505). No patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 1 year before
tissue collection. Patients 6, 11, and 14 were previously
described in Pishas and colleagues (13).
Ex vivo tissue explant system
Tissue explant system was adapted from Singh and colleagues (14). Fresh tumor samples were collected immediately
following surgical excision, dissected into 1-mm3 pieces, and
explanted onto gelatine dental sponges (Spongostan, Johnson
& Johnson) immersed in RPMI-1640 media (PAA Laboratories),
supplemented with 5% FBS (Gibco), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Gibco), 0.11 mg/mL insulin (Gibco), 10 mg/mL hyrdrocortisone
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 antibiotic/antimycotic solution (100
units penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 0.25 mg/mL amphotericin B; Sigma-Aldrich). Explants were incubated with Nutlin3a (10 mmol/L) or vehicle control [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)]
in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at 37 C containing 5% CO2 and
collected 48 hours posttreatment. ()- Nutlin-3a was sourced
from Cayman Biochemicals.

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) sections were
deparafﬁnized and quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide (10
minutes) to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. After
citrate buffer (0.001 mol/L, pH 6.0) antigen retrieval, sections
were blocked with normal goat serum (20 minutes) and
immunolabeled with the following antibodies: activated caspase-3 (ab4051, 1:100, Abcam), Ki67 (ab16667, 1:100, Abcam),
and anti-human p53 (DO-7, 1:300, Dako) overnight at 4 C.
Sections were subsequently incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories)
or anti-mouse IgG (1:250, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes
at room temperature, followed by incubation with avidin/
biotin peroxidase complexes (Vector Laboratories) for an
additional 30 minutes. Immunocomplexes were visualized
using DAB (Invitrogen) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Digital images were acquired using a Nanozoomer Digital
Pathology Scanner, magniﬁcation of 40.
Total p53 protein expression was scored according to the
intensity and percentage of positive cells from four ﬁelds of
view. Staining intensity was scored: 1 ¼ not detectable, 2 ¼
weak, 3 ¼ moderate, and 4 ¼ strong. Percentage of positive
cells was scored: 1 ¼ 0%, 2 ¼ 1%–20%, 3 ¼ 21%–50%, and 4 ¼
>51%). p53 histoscore was calculated by multiplying intensity
scores with the extent of positivity scores.
TP53 and MDM2 genotype
Exons 2 to 11 of TP53 were sequenced using primers and
parameters listed in Supplementary Table S1. Sequencing
reactions were processed on an ABI Hitachi 3730 DNA analyzer. MDM2 SNP309 tumor genotype was determined as
previously described (15).
Real-time PCR analysis
Tissue samples were homogenized using a Miccra RT
homogenizer (ART-Labortechnik) with total RNA extracted
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), using on-column RNasefree DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcribing the total
RNA using random primers (Promega) and Moloney murine
leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (H_; Promega) as previously described (16). gDNA was extracted using DNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen), with copy number variation (CNV) determined using a previously described method (7) and normalized using the a-albumin (AFM) housekeeping gene. Realtime PCR reactions were processed and normalized as
previously described (17). Primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Expression microarray analysis
Expression proﬁling was conducted using Affymetrix
Human Gene 1.0 ST array as per manufacturer's protocol from
RNA extracted from 6 sarcoma patient samples (patients 1, 2, 9,
11, 14, and 22) treated with Nutlin-3a or vehicle control. Data
were processed by applying the RMA algorithm using Partex
Genomics Suite 6.5. Genes were ranked in order of criteria 1:
their magnitude of fold activation following Nutlin-3a treatment (vehicle control vs. Nutlin-3a treatment) averaged for all

cases and criteria 2: the correlation coefﬁcients between
increased gene activation by Nutlin-3a and percentage
increase of apoptotic cells induced by Nutlin-3a. The cumulative total of these 2 independently ranked criteria provided
the basis for the ﬁnal ranking of these genes. Microarray data
have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database
(GEO GSE48296).
RNA deep sequencing
Illumina TruSeq LT protocol was used to generate cDNA and
libraries. Nine individual samples were multiplexed and
sequenced on 2 HiSeq2000 sequencers (2  100 bp). Tumor
RNA from patients 1, 2, and 10 were sequenced at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF, Melbourne, Australia) with the remaining patient samples (patients 3, 5, 12, 13, 17,
and 23) sequenced at ACRF. This resulted in 41.5 to 80.1 million
fragments per sample, using the Illumina 2  100 bp end
protocol. Reads were mapped to the human genome (Version
hg19) with Tophat2 (Version 2.0.4, using bowtie2, mate-innerdist -20, mate-std-dev 180, UCSC splice junction gtf; ref. 18).
Gene expression was quantiﬁed using HTSeq (Version 0.5.3p9;
ref. 19) and log2-transformed after regularizing peaks containing no reads to one. Comparisons between samples using
hierarchical clustering (single linkage) and heatmaps were
carried out using Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient as the
basis for the distance measure to avoid any normalization
artifacts. However, after normalization of the samples using
the median of the top quartile, clustering based on Pearson's
correlation coefﬁcient yielded similar results. Variation
between technical repeats of the transcriptome of patient
10, sequenced at 2 different facilities, was minimal (Supplementary Fig. S1).
GADD45A methylation
GADD45A CpG methylation approximately 700 bp upstream
of the GADD45A transcriptional start site was analyzed as
previously described (20). Represented here is the methylation
of the ﬁrst CpG residue out of a string of 4 CpG residues
described in Perugini and colleagues (20). Consistent with
Perugini, methylation of this individual CpG residue was
representative of methylation across this site. gDNA extracted
from untreated sarcoma specimens or sarcoma cell lines was
submitted to AGRF for GADD45A promoter methylation analysis using Sequenom MassARRAY on bisulfate-converted
gDNA.
GADD45A overexpression
TC252 GADD45A–overexpressing cells were generated using
retroviral spin-infection as previously described (21).
Cell culture
Ewing sarcoma cell lines were maintained as previously
described (17) and supplied by G. Hamilton (University of
Vienna, Vienna, Austria; TC252), F. van Valen (Westf€alischeWilhelms-University, Germany; WE-68, VH-64), J. Sonnemann
(University Children's Hospital Jena, Germany; CADO-ES1),
and P. Ambros (St. Anna Children's Hospital, Austria; STAET1). Cell lines were not authenticated by our laboratory.

Cell-cycle and viability assays
For decitabine/Nutlin-3a synergy experiments, cells were
seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (2.5  104 cells per well) and
left to adhere overnight. Cells were pretreated with 0 to 1,000
nmol/L of 50 aza-20 deoxycytidine (decitabine; Calbiochem) for
24 hours before the addition of Nutlin-3a (0–10 mmol/L) for an
additional 24 hours. For apoptosis (7-amino-actinomycin-D)
and cell-cycle analysis (propidium iodide), cells were harvested
and processed (FACS Calibur ﬂow cytometer, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) as previously described
(17).
Statistical analysis
P values were calculated using Student t test using Graph
Pad Prism version 6.

Results
Nutlin-3a induces robust apoptosis in a subset of
sarcomas
To assess the biologic response of sarcoma tissue to Nutlin3a, tumor tissue was collected immediately following surgical
resection and treated ex vivo with Nutlin-3a (10 mmol/L) or
vehicle control for 48 hours (Fig. 1A and B). This concentration
of Nutlin-3a falls well within the range of saturating tissue
concentrations that can be achieved in mouse tissue (22). The
native tissue architecture, proliferative capacity, and cellular
integrity of the tumor were maintained throughout the treatment period (Fig. 1C). Clinical characteristics and histopathology of the 24 patients with sarcoma are outlined in Table 1.
Immunohistochemical analysis of explanted tissues for activated caspase-3, showed robust apoptotic responses (>25%
increase in apoptotic cells) in 3 of 24 (12.5%) sarcomas following Nutlin-3a treatment (Fig. 1D and E). The biologic
activity of Nutlin-3a was not restricted to speciﬁc sarcoma
histotypes, as these major responses were observed in tissues
from a myxoid liposarcoma (patient 1), Ewing sarcoma
(patient 2), and a chondrosarcoma (patient 3). Tissues were
additionally stained for Ki67 to assess the degree of cytostatic
responses induced by Nutlin-3a. A marked decrease in proliferating cells (>50%) compared with vehicle control was exhibited from patients 2, 9, 15, and 22 (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B). No correlation between apoptotic and cytostatic
responses following Nutlin-3a treatment were observed (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
MDM2 ampliﬁcation does not confer Nutlin-3a
sensitivity
In an effort to understand why sarcomas from patients 1, 2,
and 3 showed strong apoptotic responses, we conducted a
genetic study to assess the role of known TP53 pathway
alterations on Nutlin-3a sensitivity. Currently, MDM2 ampliﬁcation is the benchmark biomarker required for enhanced
apoptotic response (7, 8, 23). Genomic ampliﬁcation and
mRNA overexpression of MDM2 (deﬁned as >3-fold) was
detected in 6 of 24 (25%) sarcomas (Table 1). A positive
correlation between MDM2 genomic ampliﬁcation and mRNA
overexpression was observed (r2 ¼ 0.582; Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Surprisingly, neither MDM2 ampliﬁcation nor mRNA

observed. Furthermore, MDM2 ampliﬁcation was not observed

of 24 (83%) sarcomas were wild-type for TP53 (Table 1).
Although those sarcomas that underwent robust apoptosis in
response to Nutlin-3a were all wild-type TP53, no signiﬁcant
association between TP53 status and cellular response following Nutlin-3a treatment was observed (Figs. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3C). This suggests that although wild-type TP53
may be necessary for Nutlin-3a to induce an apoptotic
response, it is not useful as a stand-alone biomarker.
Finally, we assessed whether the sequence polymorphisms
TP53 SNP72, MDM2 SNP309, and MDM4 genomic ampliﬁcation/mRNA overexpression mediate Nutlin-3a sensitivity.
MDM2 SNP309 tumor genotypes were as follows: TT (58.3%),
TG (25.0%), and GG (16.7%). TP53 SNP72 tumor genotypes
were 17 of 24 (71%) arginine and 7 of 24 (29%) proline. No
signiﬁcant statistical association was observed between any
of these TP53 pathway alterations and cellular response
following Nutlin-3a treatment (Table 1, Fig. 2C and D,
Supplementary Fig. S3D and S3E).
The global transcriptomic proﬁle of sarcomas predicts
response to Nutlin-3a
Given that known genetic p53 pathway alterations were
poor predictive markers of Nutlin-3a efﬁcacy, RNA sequencing was used (in 9 sarcomas where sufﬁcient RNA was
available) to determine the basal gene expression proﬁles
of sarcomas within our cohort. Hierarchical clustering analysis of these transcriptomes showed that those sarcomas
that were highly sensitive to Nutlin-3a shared similar basal
gene expression proﬁles (Fig 3). Given that these 3 sarcomas
are of different histopathologic classiﬁcations, this suggests
that molecular subtyping of sarcomas may be a useful

approach to identify those patients with sarcoma most likely
to respond to Nutlin-3a.
Activation of the canonical p53 pathway correlates with
apoptotic responses
In an effort to deﬁne the downstream events induced by
Nutlin-3a, induction of p53 protein levels in response to Nutlin3a treatment was investigated through immunohistochemical
analysis. A signiﬁcant increase in p53 protein induction following Nutlin-3a treatment was observed in sarcomas undergoing apoptotic responses (P ¼ 0.006; Fig. 4A and B). In
contrast, p53 protein induction by Nutlin-3a was not an
indicator of cytostatic responses (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
activation of the canonical p53 pathway by Nutlin-3a in
sarcomas is speciﬁcally linked to apoptotic but not cytostatic
outcomes. Furthermore, moderate cytostatic responses (>20%
reduction in proliferating cells) were observed in 2 sarcomas
harboring TP53 mutations (patients 20 and 24), providing
additional evidence that the cytostatic capabilities of Nutlin3a may be mediated through a p53-independent pathway.
Given that canonical p53 pathway activation was signiﬁcantly associated with Nutlin-3a–induced apoptosis, gene
expression microarray analysis was used to identify downstream TP53 target genes that were speciﬁcally activated only
in those sarcomas that underwent signiﬁcant apoptosis following Nutlin-3a treatment. The top 7 genes are listed in Table
2 and includes 4 established TP53 target genes GADD45A,
BBC3, RPS27L, and pre-mir34A (26). GADD45A and BBC3
induction was validated through real-time PCR analysis and
was correlated with Nutlin-3a–induced apoptosis (r2 ¼ 0.566
and 0.418, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S4).

GADD45A methylation: a mechanism of Nutlin-3a
resistance
We next examined whether epigenetic silencing is a mechanism through which these p53 target genes were not activated
in sarcomas that did not respond to Nutlin-3a. Aberrant
proximal promoter methylation of GADD45A, approximately
700 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site, has been
reported in solid tumors (27–29) and hematological malignancies (20). GADD45A CpG promoter methylation was highly
prevalent in our cohort (0%–89% methylation; Fig. 5A). Hypermethylation was deﬁned as methylation exceeding the highest
level observed in 5 matching germline samples (>12%). Hypermethylation of GADD45A was absent from the 3 sarcomas in
which the strongest apoptotic responses to Nutlin-3a were
observed. In contrast, GADD45A hypermethylation was evident
in 14/17 (82%) of wild-type TP53 sarcomas that did not show
robust apoptosis to Nutlin-3a. Indeed, hypermethylation of
GADD45A was signiﬁcantly correlated with poor apoptotic
response following Nutlin-3a treatment (P ¼ 0.009), thus
providing a possible mechanism through which several sarcomas suppress the downstream apoptotic pathways of p53.
On the basis of histologic subtype, hypermethylation of
GADD45A was observed for all wild-type TP53 well-/de-differentiated liposarcomas, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, and myxoﬁbrosarcomas (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Interestingly, none of the mutant TP53 tumors showed evidence of
GADD45A promoter methylation, with methylation levels signiﬁcantly lower than wild-type TP53 tumors (P ¼ 0.042;
Supplementary Fig. S5B). We next assessed whether hypermethylation of GADD45A was a reﬂection of global tumor
hypermethylation. No correlation between GADD45A methylation and total global methylation (5-methylcytosine levels)
was observed, suggesting that GADD45A methylation was a
deﬁned event (Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D). Together,

www.aacrjournals.org

these results imply that epigenetic silencing of p53 target genes
such as GADD45A is one mechanism through which sarcomas
possess intrinsic resistance to Nutlin-3a.
Overexpression of GADD45A induces sarcoma apoptosis
We subsequently investigated whether reactivation of
GADD45A using the clinically approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine could enhance Nutlin-3a induced
apoptosis. GADD45A CpG methylation was observed in a panel
of 5 Ewing sarcoma cell lines but not in primary nonmalignant
human osteoblasts (Supplementary Fig. S6). TC252 cells (displaying the highest level of GADD45A CpG methylation) were
pretreated with decitabine for 24 hours before addition of
Nutlin-3a for a further 24 hours. Increased apoptosis was
observed when these 2 agents were combined (Fig. 5B) both
in TC252 cells and an additional GADD45A hypermethylated
cell line, STA-ET1. These ﬁndings provide a rationale for the
use of epigenetic-based antitumor agents to enhance Nutlin3a–induced apoptosis.
Given that GADD45A transactivation by Nutlin-3a was associated with apoptotic outcomes (Table 2), we explored the
biologic effects of induced GADD45A expression in sarcomas.
Retroviral-mediated ectopic expression of GADD45A in TC252
cells resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis (Fig. 5C),
which is consistent with previous studies showing a proapoptotic role for GADD45A (30–33). Colony formation assays
comparing control and GADD45A-overexpressing TC252 cells
plated at low density also showed an 82% reduction in the
number of discrete colonies formed, 10 days after seeding (P <
0.0001; Fig. 5D).

Substantial improvements in overall survival rates for most
patients with sarcoma have not been achieved particularly for

those with metastatic disease. Future progress will be dependent not on the discovery of new cytotoxic chemotherapeutics
but rather from the development of non-genotoxic targeted
therapies. The unique characteristic of sarcomas to retain
functional wild-type TP53 status suggests that sarcomas are
ideal candidates for targeted therapies that reactivate the TP53
pathway. The efﬁcacy of such agents will be contingent on the
identiﬁcation of biomarkers that can prospectively identify
patients most likely to respond to this novel therapeutic
approach.

To date, the in vitro study of immortalized cancer cell lines
has been the primary method used to examine the therapeutic
potential of p53-MDM2 antagonists. Such culture systems have
several limitations and do not accurately recapitulate the
complex genetic characteristics and cellular heterogeneity of
the original tumor from which the cell line was derived. To
circumvent these limitations, we used an ex vivo methodology
to directly assess the cellular response and clinical importance
of genetic and epigenetic determinants underlying sarcoma
apoptotic sensitivity to Nutlin-3a.

Our results show that restoration of the TP53 pathway
through Nutlin-3a effectively induces apoptotic and cytostatic
cellular fates in a subset of sarcoma biopsies that is not
dependent on histologic subtype. This is supported by several
preclinical in vitro and mouse xenograft studies, which showed
that Nutlin-3a can effectively activate the TP53 pathway,
resulting in cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma
(17, 34), liposarcoma (7), osteosarcoma (8), rhabdomyosarcoma (35), and synovial sarcoma (36).

The initial rationale for the development of MDM2
antagonists was for the targeted treatment of tumors with
almost universal MDM2 ampliﬁcation, such as well-/dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Several groups have shown
through cell culture and mouse xenograft studies that
MDM2 ampliﬁcation predisposes cells to undergo enhanced
apoptotic responses following Nutlin-3a treatment (7, 8, 23).
On the basis of these preclinical studies, it was presumed
that MDM2 ampliﬁcation is the key benchmark biomarker

required for Nutlin-3a sensitivity. Although genomic ampliﬁcation and/or mRNA overexpression of MDM2 was
observed in 25% of sarcomas in this study, strong apoptotic
responses were not elicited in any of these sarcomas following Nutlin-3a treatment. Furthermore, neither MDM2
ampliﬁcation nor overexpression was observed in any of
the 3 sarcomas in which the most robust apoptotic
responses were elicited (patients 1, 2, and 3). These results
are supported by a recent Nutlin (RG7112) early-phase
clinical study conducted in patients with well-/de-differentiated liposarcomas. Only one partial response was observed
in a patient harboring MDM2 ampliﬁcation (9). Taken
together our observations imply that MDM2 ampliﬁcation
is not signiﬁcantly associated with apoptotic outcomes
induced by Nutlin-3a and questions the use of MDM2
ampliﬁcation as a biomarker to guide patient recruitment
in clinical trials involving MDM2 antagonists.
In an effort to identify biomarkers that would better
predict Nutlin-3a sensitivity, gene expression array analysis
was undertaken to identify alterations in key downstream
TP53 target genes that drive apoptosis. We identiﬁed that
one of these target genes (GADD45A) was hypermethylated
in 82% (14 of 17) of wild-type TP53 sarcomas that did not
respond to Nutlin-3a. Indeed, absence of methylation was
signiﬁcantly correlated with apoptotic response following
Nutlin-3a treatment (P ¼ 0.0090). Interestingly, methylation
of GADD45A was not evident in any mutant TP53 tumors
supporting the hypothesis that inactivation of GADD45A
may be a central mechanism of innate resistance to p53induced apoptosis and is therefore not selected for in TP53mutant tumors. This is further supported by reports showing
that promoter methylation of GADD45A is associated with
poor overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia, a tumor
type in which TP53 mutations are infrequent (<10%;
refs. 20, 37, 38).
In addition to coordinating DNA excision repair and cellcycle regulation, growing evidence has implicated that
GADD45 proteins possess proapoptotic functions through
activation of the JNK/p38 signalling pathway (39, 40). Recently,
it has been reported that MDM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin
ligase for GADD45A. Enhanced association between MDM2
and RPS7 following arsenite treatment attenuated MDM2mediated GADD45A ubiquitination, resulting in GADD45A
protein stabilization and apoptosis (41). Interestingly, our
microarray analysis identiﬁed RPS27L, a direct TP53 target,
that modulates cell fate in response to genotoxic stress (42), to
be upregulated only in those sarcomas in which robust apoptotic responses were observed. RPS27L has been shown to be
translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm where it
colocalizes with MDM2 in response to p53-inducing signals
(43). Like RPL7, RPS27L is a physiologic substrate of MDM2 and
binds MDM2 via its central acidic domain (43, 44). Therefore,
it may be plausible for sarcomas in which enhanced apoptotic response was observed that Nutlin-3a exposure
induced the proapoptotic activity of GADD45A by blocking
its constitutive ubiquitination and degradation by enhancing the interaction between ribosomal proteins such as
RPS27L and MDM2. However, it is clear that further inves-

930

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

tigations are required to elucidate the role of GADD45A in
Nutlin-induced apoptosis.
Epigenetic alterations (hypermethylation of 50 regulatory
CpG genomic regions) have been implicated in the repression
and inactivation of cellular pathways that contribute to tumorigenesis such as those governing apoptosis. This is the ﬁrst
study to link GADD45A promoter methylation with innate
resistance to MDM2 antagonists. Indeed, treatment of
GADD45A hypermethylated sarcoma cell lines with decitabine
augmented the apoptotic potential of Nutlin-3a. Collectively,
our ﬁndings suggest that promoter methylation of GADD45A
represents a novel marker that could potentially be used to
stratify patients with sarcoma in future clinical trials and
provides a rationale for combining MDM2 antagonists with
demethylating agents in selected patients, a combinational
approach that has not been investigated in any disease type
before this study.
In summary, our ﬁndings provide a clear insight into the
current lack of understanding of predictive markers that
mediate Nutlin-3a sensitivity and offer a rationale to redeﬁne
the inclusion criteria for patient recruitment in clinical trials
involving MDM2 antagonists.
