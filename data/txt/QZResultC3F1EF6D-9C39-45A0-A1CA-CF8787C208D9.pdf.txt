BACKGROUND. Many patients with invasive urothelial cell cancer are poor candidates for cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and many are high risk for cystectomy.
Southwest Oncology Group Trial 8733 was designed to address treatment for
such patients.

METHODS. Eligible patients had primary or recurrent muscle-invasive disease
with transitional cell or squamous cell histology, a performance status from 0 to
2, no extrapelvic disease, a life expectancy >3 months, and adequate hematologic
function. The treating clinician assigned patients to operable or inoperable
groups. All patients received 2 cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at a dose of
1000 mg/m2 per day 3 4 starting concurrently with radiation at a dose of 200
centigrays per day 3 10 each cycle. After 2 cycles, operable patients with positive

tandard treatment for patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is
cystectomy. The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)
conducted a phase 3 trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cystectomy versus cystectomy alone.
The chemotherapy regimen consisted of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cisplatin (MVAC). This trial, S8710, demonstrated a
survival benefit for patients who received chemotherapy in addition to cystectomy.1 During the accrual
phase of the randomized trial, however, it was noted
that many otherwise eligible patients were either
poor surgical candidates or had impaired renal function and/or other comorbidities that made it difficult
to treat with cisplatin or to administer prolonged
general anesthesia for cystectomy. At that time, the
majority of combined modality approaches for bladder cancer included cisplatin. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
which generally is tolerated well when it is administered by 4-day continuous infusion, has no renal toxicity and is a radiosensitizer that has been used in
combination with radiation in cancers of the head
and neck, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and anus.
A phase I/II study2 of 34 patients with urothelial cancer of the bladder evaluated 5-FU and radiation in
both operable patients and inoperable patients. This
regimen had little toxicity and the complete response
(CR) rate was 81% with a 5-year survival rate of 64%.
Another small phase II trial of 20 patients also evaluated this combination.3 The CR rate in that trial was
74%, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 39%.
The SWOG sought to evaluate this approach further in patients who were poor surgical candidates or
who otherwise were ineligible to receive cisplatinbased neoadjuvant therapy on S8710. In those patients who potentially could withstand surgery,
cystectomy was performed only if there was persistent disease detected on biopsy after 2 cycles of
chemotherapy and radiation. In all other patients,
3 cycles of chemotherapy and radiation were administered. The current report describes the tolerability
of the regimen and the long-term outcome of these
patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
All patients were recruited from participating SWOG
institutions and had to have primary or recurrent
muscle-invasive disease with transitional cell or
squamous cell histology and could not be eligible for
the ongoing SWOG trial S8710 of cystectomy versus
MVAC followed by cystectomy. Pathologic review to
confirm the diagnosis and presence of muscle inva-

sion was performed by a single pathologist (W.A.S.).
A SWOG performance status of 0 to 2 (Karnofsky
score, 50–100), a life expectancy >3 months, and
adequate hematologic function were necessary. A
baseline computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis, a chest x-ray, and bone scans were required.
Patients with disease outside the pelvis were not eligible. Patients who had received prior pelvic radiation and those with pre-existing gastrointestinal
disorders, such as chronic diarrhea, malabsorption,
extensive diverticular disease, or inflammatory bowel
disease, also were ineligible. All patients signed
informed consent approved by the local institutional
review board.
At the time of initial registration, patients who
were considered operable candidates with tumors
classified as T2, T3, or T4 were assigned to the operable group. Patients with pelvic lymph node involvement, contraindications for cystectomy, or those who
refused surgery were placed in the inoperable group.
Descriptive information regarding transurethral bladder tumor resection (TURBT) status was collected.
The treatment schema is shown in Figure 1. After
completing baseline staging studies and registration,
patients were treated with 5-FU at a dose of
1000 mg/m2 per day (2000 mg maximum dose per
day) by continuous intravenous infusion on Days 1
through 4 and started concurrent radiation at a dose
of 200 centigrays (cGy) per day to the bladder and
pelvic lymph nodes. Treatments were delivered on
Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12 through a
4-field arrangement involving parallel, opposed anteroposterior/posteroanterior and right/left lateral portals encompassing the bladder as well as the
obturator, hypogastric, and external iliac lymph node
basins. This was followed by another cycle of the
same doses of chemotherapy and radiation beginning again on Day 22. Operable patients underwent
a cystoscopy with at least 3 deep biopsies within 3
weeks after completion of 40 grays of radiation at
approximately Week 8. After the biopsies, patients in
the operable group underwent a second registration.

Bladder-Sparing Option for High-Risk Patients/Higano et al.

The treatment course was based on pathologic findings. Patients who had persistent tumor were offered
cystectomy. Patients who had no evidence of tumor
received a third cycle of chemotherapy and radiation
rather than cystectomy. During the third cycle,
chemotherapy was administered as described above
and 400 cGy were delivered to the pelvis with a boost
of 1600 cGy delivered to the bladder with 1.5-cm
margins. Patients in the inoperable group received 3
consecutive cycles of chemotherapy and radiation as
described above for patients in the operable group,
with the third cycle starting on Day 43 and finishing
on Day 54. These patients underwent CT of the pelvis
and cystoscopy 2 months after the completion of
treatment (approximately Week 16) and were to
undergo biopsies as described above for patients in
the operable group. There was no second registration
for the inoperable group. Thereafter, follow-up for
both groups consisted of cystoscopy every 2 months
for the first year, every 3 months for the second year,
and every 6 months thereafter.
Dose modifications were based on laboratory
values at the time of planned chemotherapy administration and on interim nonhematologic toxicities of
the preceding cycle. 5-FU was administered at the
full dose if the absolute neutrophil count was 1500
3 106/L and the platelet count was 100,000 3 109/
L. If the absolute neutrophil count was <1500 3 106/
L but 1000 3 106/L or if the platelet count was
<100,000 3 109/L but 75,000 3 109/L, then the 5FU dose was reduced to 750 mg/m2. If the absolute
neutrophil count was <1000 3 106/L or the platelet
count was <75,000 3 109/L, then the chemotherapy
and radiation were held for 1 week, and the counts
were repeated. If the counts remained low, then
radiation was resumed without chemotherapy. All
toxicities were graded according to the Cancer Clinical Trials Common Toxicity Criteria. For patients
with grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity, stomatitis,
or skin toxicity, the chemotherapy was withheld in
subsequent cycles.

Statistical Considerations
Descriptive factors that were collected at the time of
registration were morphologic description (sessile vs
papillary) and the extent of removal of lesion(s)
(resected vs not resected) by TURBT. The primary
endpoint was to estimate the probability of a CR,
which was defined as a negative deep-muscle biopsy
(cytology alone was not adequate); complete radiographic regression of initially positive regional lymph
nodes, if applicable; and no new lesions. Secondary
endpoints were progression-free survival and overall
survival. If the tumor was resected completely by

2183

TURBT, then response criteria were not applicable
and disease progression was defined as a positive biopsy of the bladder; a regional or distant disease site;
or CT, bone scan, or plain film evidence of regional
or distant disease recurrence. If the tumor was not
resected completely by TURBT, then disease progression was defined as evidence of progression of the
primary tumor by cystoscopy or radiographically or
the development of new bladder lesions. Radiographic enlargement of prior adenopathy or the development of distant metastasis also constituted
progression. Progression-free survival was defined as
the time from registration until first evidence of disease progression or death from any cause. Overall
survival was defined the time from registration to
death from any cause. Patients were censored at
their last known contact date.
Separate accrual goals were set for the operable
and inoperable groups. For the operable group, a
true probability of attaining a CR 30% was of interest, whereas further investigation would not be pursued if the response probability was 10%. A 2-stage
design was used in which 2 responses observed in
the first 20 patients would enable the accrual of 20
additional patients. Eight or more responses observed in 40 patients would provide strong enough
evidence of treatment benefit to justify further study
of the regimen. For the inoperable group, a true
probability of attaining a CR 45% was of interest,
whereas a response probability 20% was not. The
inoperable group received an additional course of
treatment, hence the requirement of a higher
response rate. Twenty patients were to be accrued to
the first stage and if 3 or more responses were
observed, then an additional 15 patients were to be
accrued. Twelve or more responses observed in 35
patients would warrant further study.

RESULTS
From 1988 to 1997, 81 patients were recruited from
23 SWOG institutions. There were 24 eligible patients
and 9 ineligible patients in the operable group, and
there were 37 eligible patients and 11 ineligible
patients in the inoperable group. Patient characteristics and descriptive factors are listed in Table 1. Reasons for ineligibility in the operable group included
no evidence of muscle invasion on pathology review
(3 patients), prestudy biopsy performed >42 days
before registration (2 patients), prior pelvic radiation
(1 patient), missing initial prestudy forms (1 patient),
missing evidence of prestudy bone scan or chest xray (1 patient), and insufficient materials for pathology review (1 patient). Reasons for ineligibility in the

patients), and the presence of bone metastases at
registration (1 patient).

Response Data
Figure 2 summarizes the results for patients in the
operable group. Of 24 eligible patients in the operable group, 17 patients underwent pretreatment
TURBT and 7 patients did not. Of the 17 patients
who underwent TURBT, 6 patients achieved a complete resection and 11 patients had persistent disease. Response criteria could not be applied to the
6 patients who achieved complete resection with
TURBT. Of the 18 patients who had evaluable disease, 5 patients attained a CR (28%; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 10%–53%), 9 patients were stable,
1 patient developed disease progression, and
3 patients were not assessable because of early death
(1 patient), off study before biopsy (1 patient), and
insufficient data (1 patient), and we assumed that
they were nonresponders. Of the 17 patients in the
operable group who were eligible for postcystoscopy
registration, 6 patients had a positive biopsy, and
11 patients had a negative biopsy after 2 cycles of
therapy. Five of 6 patients who had positive biopsies

patients who had a negative biopsy was 28 months
compared with 8 months for patients who had a
positive biopsy (log-rank P 5 .004; curves not
shown). For all patients in the operable group, the
median progression-free survival was 10 months
(95% CI, 5–14 months), and the median overall survival was 18 months (95% CI, 7–28 months).
The response data for the inoperable group are
summarized in Figure 4. Of 37 eligible patients,
25 patients underwent pretherapy TURBT, and 2 of
those patients achieved complete resection of disease. Of 35 patients who were evaluable for response
(23 patients with persistent disease after TURBT
and 12 patients who did not undergo TURBT),
17 patients (49%) achieved a CR (95% CI, 31%–66%),
6 patients were stable, 2 patients developed disease
progression, and 10 patients were not assessable for
response (1 early death, 8 missing rebiopsies, and 1
with missing scans), and we assumed that they were
nonresponders. Figure 5 shows the Kaplan-Meier
progression-free and overall survival plots for this
group. The median progression-free survival for all
inoperable patients was 13 months (95% CI, 10–
17 months), and the median overall survival was
20 months (95% CI, 11–53 months). Stratifying by
CR status in the inoperable group, the median progression-free survival for non-CR responders was
9 months, and the median was 27 months for
patients who achieved a CR (log-rank P 5 .0003).

Entire Study Population
The median survival for all 61 eligible patients on
the entire trial was 19 months, and the Kaplan-Meier
estimated survival rate at 5 years was 28%. Of

58 deaths, the cause was coded in 34 patients. Death
in 25 patients was because of cancer, including
22 patients with bladder cancer, 1 patient with nonsmall cell lung cancer, and 2 patients who had either
bladder cancer and/or lung cancer. Two other
patients were known to have metastatic disease but
died of other causes (cardiac and lung). One patient
died of an aneurysm with a CR in the bladder but a
recurrence in the urethra. Three patients died of cardiac disease, and 3 patients died of other causes
without evidence of recurrent bladder cancer. The
cause of death could not be determined for an additional 24 patients.

Toxicities
There were no episodes of grade 4 or 5 toxicity in
any patients on this trial. In the operable group,
there was 1 episode of grade 3 granulocytopenia in
22 patients who received 2 cycles of chemotherapy
and radiation before cystoscopy and second registration. The most common toxicities were grade 1 diarrhea (16 patients), urinary urgency and frequency
(9 patients), stomatitis (7 patients), and fatigue
(6 patients). Of the 5 patients who underwent cystectomy, grade 1 anemia was reported in 1 patient,

2186

and there were no other toxicities reported. For the
11 patients who received a third cycle of chemotherapy and radiation, 4 patients experienced grade
3 toxicity, including diarrhea, urinary urgency and
frequency, dyspnea, and leukopenia.
In the inoperable group, 33 of 37 patients
received all 3 cycles of chemotherapy and radiation.
Fourteen patients experienced grade 3 toxicity as
their worst grade, and the most common were
dysuria (3 patients), diarrhea (2 patients), bladder
other (2 patients), and urinary urgency and frequency (2 patients).

DISCUSSION
This pilot study of patients who were not good candidates for MVAC and/or surgery or who refused surgery was designed to evaluate the tolerability and
response rate of 5-FU with radiation in this population of patients with multiple comorbidities. The
study clearly demonstrates that this therapy is tolerated well. All but 3 patients were followed until death,
and some patients lived for >10 years. The median
survival was 18 months in the operable group and 20
months in the inoperable group with 5-year overall
survival rates of 22% and 30%, respectively. The 5year survival rates for more contemporary series of
radiation therapy alone range from 20% to 40%.4–8
In another trial conducted by the SWOG, 56
patients who were not fit medically for surgery or
who refused surgery and had T2, T3, or T4 tumors;
NX, N0, N1, or N2 lymph node status; and metastasis-negative (M0) disease received cisplatin, 5-FU,
and radiation.9 Treatment was completed as planned
in 53% of those patients compared with 92% of
patients in our operable group and 100% of patients
in our inoperable group from the current study.
There were no treatment-related deaths in either
study; however, 45% of patients who were evaluable
for toxicity in the other study experienced grade 3 or
4 events after treatment with cisplatin, 5-FU, and
radiation compared with 28% in the current study. In
the other study, the estimated median survival with
treatment with cisplatin and 5-FU was 27 months,
and the overall survival rate at 5 years was 32%,
compared with a median survival of 19 months and
an overall 5-year survival rate of 28% with 5-FU and
radiation noted in the current trial.
We acknowledge that the current study had
many limitations. First, it was designed as a pilot
study to offer a bladder-sparing approach to
patients who had multiple comorbidities and
therefore were poor candidates for the available
SWOG trial evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy

with MVAC followed by cystectomy versus cystectomy alone. Because some patients in this category
otherwise were operable, whereas others clearly
were not, the study was complex and certainly
would not be the design of choice by contemporary standards. The study was not designed to compare bladder sparing with cystectomy or to
determine whether 5-FU with radiation was superior to radiation alone. Furthermore, it would have
been ideal to compare biopsy status after 2 cycles
of chemoradiotherapy in both the operable group
and the inoperable group to establish the pathologic response; however, patients in the inoperable
group generally were poor candidates for general
anesthesia. Consequently, even the required restaging biopsy, which was to be performed after treatment was complete, was not performed in many
patients. In this trial, there was no attempt to
evaluate bladder function and patient bother,
although the treatment appeared to be tolerated
extremely well by these patients with several other
comorbidities.
This trial was completed before conformal external-beam radiation or taxanes were available. Newer
drugs and improved radiation techniques, coupled
with a better selection of patients using prognostic
markers, currently may provide this population of
patients with reasonable, less invasive treatment
options. A recently reported phase 1 trial performed in
this same population of patients10 demonstrated that
gemcitabine and concurrent radiation is tolerated well.
Whether the addition of chemotherapy adds benefit to
radiation alone should be studied further in this population of patients who are not good surgical candidates, and the importance of preventing local disease
recurrence on quality of life should be addressed.
