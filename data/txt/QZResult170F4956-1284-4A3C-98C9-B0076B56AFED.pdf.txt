Regulatory T-cell Modulation Using Cyclophosphamide in
Vaccine Approaches: A Current Perspective
Dung T. Le and Elizabeth M. Jaffee

Abstract
Regulatory T cells (Treg) have become an important player in regulating anticancer immune responses. In fact,
published studies describe a correlation between tumor-inﬁltrating Tregs and poor prognosis. Once called
"suppressor T cells," these T cells evaded isolation because of a lack of known markers that distinguished them
from other T cells. However, the biology of these T cells is currently a major focus of immunologic research.
Markers have since been discovered that identify these T cells and provide insights into how these T cells are
regulated. Despite these advances, much needs to be learned about the subsets of Tregs and their speciﬁc roles in
regulating immune responses. In addition, speciﬁc agents that target Tregs are currently unavailable. Cyclophosphamide has emerged as a clinically feasible agent that can suppress Tregs and allow more effective
induction of antitumor immune responses. This review focuses on the use of cyclophosphamide in targeting Tregs
to augment cancer vaccine approaches. However, these principles can also be applied to other immunotherapy
strategies. Cancer Res; 72(14); 3439–44. 2012 AACR.

Introduction

Historical Perspective

Cancer vaccines have come of age, with the ﬁrst vaccine
approved for prostate cancer treatment. Yet, the survival
beneﬁt as a single agent is modest. Accumulating evidence
now supports multiple mechanisms of immune tolerance that
inhibit the most potent antitumor immune responses and
reinforce the use of a multipronged approach, which combines
agents that prime and expand the best tumor-speciﬁc T cells
with agents that target immune-suppressive factors. Combinatorial vaccination strategies are under development, testing
immune adjuvants that recruit and activate antigen-presenting cells (APC) and agents that provide additional activating
signals to APCs and T cells. Also under development are
antagonist antibodies that target inhibitory signaling pathways, promoting checkpoint blockade of signals that T cells
receive from APCs, tumors, and Tregs. However, currently no
agents speciﬁcally inhibit Tregs. Cyclophosphamide is the
agent used most extensively to inhibit Tregs, not only because
it is widely available and inexpensive, but increasing evidence
suggests that it has multiple immune-modifying properties.
Entire reviews have focused on this multifaceted aspect of
cyclophosphamide and have enumerated the vast number of
proposed mechanisms responsible for its immune properties.
This review focuses speciﬁcally on the use of cyclophosphamide to inhibit Tregs in the context of cancer vaccines.

Cyclophosphamide has many purported immune-modulatory mechanisms. Sistigu and colleagues recently reviewed
many mechanisms that include TH2/TH1 to TH17 shifts in
cytokine production, induction of TH17 cells, inhibition of
Tregs, enhancement of T-cell proliferation and survival, and
resetting of dendritic cell homeostasis (1, 2). However, the
earliest mechanism proposed was the inhibition of a population of suppressor T cells. These T cells were difﬁcult to isolate
because of the lack of a marker speciﬁc for this population until
the discovery of FOXP3, a transcriptional regulator of what are
now known as Tregs. Multiple subsets of Tregs, constitutive
and inducible, CD4þ and CD8þ, FoxP3þ and FoxP3, have
since been described in the context of malignancy. Most
studies associate the presence of CD4þCD25þFoxP3þ Tregs
in tumors with poor prognosis. This ﬁnding has been shown in
a number of cancers, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic
cancers (3–5). In some cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma,
Tregs in the tumor microenvironment have been associated
with improved clinical outcomes (6). More recent studies
suggest that it is T-effector (Teff)–Treg ratios that correlate
with effective antitumor responses (7). In fact, a natural
response to vaccination is the concurrent induction of Teffs
and Tregs. Thus, it is likely that the balance of these T-cell
subsets inﬂuences outcomes.
As early as 1974, Polak and Turk postulated that cyclophosphamide reversed immune tolerance in a guinea pig–
sensitization model through inhibition of a yet-to-be-identiﬁed suppressor T-cell population (8). Throughout the
1980s, experiments done by North and colleagues suggested
that cyclophosphamide augmented adoptive immunotherapy by inhibiting suppressor T cells. In 1988, Awwad and
North (9) published an article on the effects of cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg i.v.) in combination with passively

transferred tumor-sensitized T cells in a cyclophosphamideresistant tumor model. Adoptively transferred T cells were
administered 1 hour after cyclophosphamide. Because the
tumor was resistant to cyclophosphamide, this model suggested that cyclophosphamide's effects were through the
inhibition of suppressor T cells, rather than a direct effect on
tumor burden. That same year, Berd and Mastrangelo used a
regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 i.v.),
given 3 days prior to vaccination with autologous melanoma
cells admixed with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), to treat
patients with melanoma (10). Cyclophosphamide plus vaccine resulted in a decrease in the proportion of CD4þ T cells
expressing 2H4 (CD45), which they stated was an identiﬁer
of "inducers of suppression." The reduction did not become
apparent until day 28 and became statistically signiﬁcant on
day 49. Interestingly, they did not see an effect of cyclophosphamide on the suppressor population expressing the
interleukin-2 receptor (CD25).
Machiels and colleagues evaluated the potential of several
chemotherapies, including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
and paclitaxel, to potentiate the effects of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)–secreting wholecell vaccines in the HER-2/neu mouse model of mammary
cancers (11). They determined that both the dose and sequence
of drug administration in relation to vaccine delivery was
important in mediating enhancement of vaccine effects. Again,
the mechanism for cyclophosphamide's effect was not due to
direct cytolytic effect on cancer cells, but through cyclophosphamide's inﬂuence on immunity. When cyclophosphamide
was given at a dose range between 50 and 150 mg/kg 1 day prior
to vaccine, the combination controlled tumors more effectively
than either agent alone. The same treatment 7 days later was
ineffective. Higher doses of cyclophosphamide did not enhance
and often abrogated vaccine efﬁcacy. The improved efﬁcacy of
lower doses of cyclophosphamide supported that the antitumor effects were not mediated through cyclophosphamide's
cytolytic capacity. In these studies, cyclophosphamide was
shown to amplify the T-helper 1 neu-speciﬁc T-cell response.
In 2004, Ghiringhelli and colleagues (12) showed that a single
administration of cyclophosphamide at 25 to 30 mg/kg in rats
depleted CD4þCD25þ T cells and delayed the growth of colon
carcinomas. In addition, cyclophosphamide given prior to
tumor cells mixed with BCG resulted in complete regression
of tumors. Furthermore, cyclophosphamide induced a
decrease in the CD4þCD25þ/CD4þ splenic T-cell ratio in the
spleen resected 7 days after a single dose. This decrease was
also seen with methotrexate and anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody. In this model, the CD4þCD25þ/CD4þ ratio reached its
nadir at 7 days.
After Hori and colleagues (13) identiﬁed the transcription
factor FoxP3 as a key regulator in Treg development, reports
followed showing cyclophosphamide-mediated reductions in
FoxP3þ Tregs. Subsequent studies showed that, in addition to
cyclophosphamide's effect on decreasing Treg number, lowdose cyclophosphamide decreased the functionality of Tregs
(14). Lutsiak and colleagues (14) isolated Tregs from untreated
and cyclophosphamide-treated (2 mg intraperitoneally) mice
2 and 10 days after cyclophosphamide treatment and evaluated

3440

the Tregs in suppression assays. Cyclophosphamide-treated
Tregs had signiﬁcant impairment in their suppressive capacity,
which returned by day 10 after treatment. Cyclophosphamide
also interfered with homeostatic proliferation of Tregs,
increased their susceptibility to apoptosis, and decreased their
expression of suppression markers, including glucocorticoidinduced TNF receptor–related protein (GITR) and FoxP3.

Low- Versus High-Dose Cyclophosphamide
Depending on the dose administered, cyclophosphamide's
antitumor effects are either through immune potentiation or
direct cytolytic activity. In the HER2/neu mouse model, cyclophosphamide was most effective in enhancing vaccine effects
given at a dose range between 50 and 150 mg/kg (11). Higher
doses hampered vaccine-induced immunity by causing bone
marrow suppression. This ﬁnding was further supported by
Motoyoshi and colleagues, who showed that low- (20 mg/kg),
but not high-dose (200 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide selectively
suppressed CD4þCD25þ T-cell numbers, sparing conventional
CD4þ and CD8þ T cells and preventing murine hepatoma
growth (15). In the low-dose group, the decline in CD4þCD25þ
T cells was more profound and recovered more slowly than
CD4þ T cells, resulting in lower ratios of CD4þCD25þ/CD4þ
T cells for longer periods of time. In contrast, in the high-dose
group, all T-cell subsets and the ratio were severely decreased.
Low and high doses of cyclophosphamide were also compared
in immuncompetent and nude mice. Although low doses were
effective in treating tumors only in immunocompetent mice,
the high doses worked in immunocompetent and nude mice.
This ﬁnding suggested that low-dose cyclophosphamide contributes to antitumor immunity, whereas high-dose cyclophosphamide works solely through its cytotoxic effects. Low-dose
cyclophosphamide also resulted in higher intratumoral lymphocyte inﬁltration. Repletion of CD4þCD25þ T cells abolished
the antitumor effect of low-dose cyclophosphamide.
Emens and colleagues (16) conducted a trial in patients with
breast cancer to address the question of dosing. In this study,
an allogeneic, HER2-positive GM-CSF–secreting breast tumor
vaccine was given alone or in sequence with low-dose cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. The study used a factorial
design to identify the cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin
dose combination that maximized vaccine-induced immune
responses. The range of cyclophosphamide doses tested was
200 mg/m2 to 450 mg/m2. On the basis of the HER2/neu mouse
model, cyclophosphamide was given 1 day prior to vaccine at
the time of T-cell priming, and doxorubicin was given on day 7
at the time of T-cell expansion (11). Immune readouts included
assessment of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses
to HER2 human leukocyte antigen–class II–restricted peptides
and measurement of HER2 antibodies. The addition of 200
mg/m2 cyclophosphamide had no impact on the rate of DTH
development, but cyclophosphamide doses higher than 200
mg/m2 suppressed vaccine-induced DTH responses, compared with vaccine alone. Furthermore, induction of HER2speciﬁc humoral immunity was optimally enhanced at the
200-mg/m2 dose and decreased with higher cyclophosphamide
doses. Although this study assessed the combination of

Regulatory T-cell Modulation Using Cyclophosphamide

cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and not cyclophosphamide alone, the results suggest that cyclophosphamide doses
above 200 mg/m2 may abrogate immune responses induced by
vaccination and that the optimal cyclophosphamide dose for
enhancing vaccine-induced immunity in humans is 200 mg/m2
or lower. Lower doses were not tested in this study. However,
Greten and colleagues (17) evaluated single-agent cyclophosphamide doses of 150, 250, and 350 mg/m2 in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma and reported that the 2 lower doses
induced a decrease in the absolute and relative frequency of
Tregs in the blood of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,
and the 250 mg/m2 dose impaired suppressor function
and showed decreased Treg frequency out to day 71. Alphafetoprotein–speciﬁc T-cell responses were also induced in
the lower treatment arms (17). On the contrary, a previous
report testing an allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine in patients
identiﬁed 300 mg/m2 given 3 days prior to vaccine as the
optimal dose (18). The other doses tested were 150 mg/m2 and
75 mg/m2. However, the immune readout was the reduction in
peripheral CD8þCD11Bþ suppressor cells. A second melanoma
study evaluating the addition of melanoma-associated helper
peptides and cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2 i.v. 3 days prior to
a melanoma vaccine, concluded that cyclophosphamide did
not augment T-cell responses to that vaccine (19).
Given the ﬁndings in murine studies and the clinical trials
assessing actual effector responses, future studies should focus
on evaluation of the lower range of cyclophosphamide doses
typically used to inhibit Tregs (range, 150–1,000 mg/m2 i.v.).
Additional studies are needed to better understand the effects
of cyclophosphamide at lower doses.

Metronomic Oral Cyclophosphamide
Metronomic oral cyclophosphamide is administered in an
iterative low-dose fashion. Historically, low doses of chemotherapeutic agents have been given in this manner to inhibit
angiogenesis. The potential beneﬁt of an alternative way to
administer cyclophosphamide is that a lower, more continuous dosing schedule may allow for more effective and prolonged inhibition of Tregs, as most studies suggest that Treg
levels recover 7 to 10 days after i.v. administration. Ghiringhelli
and colleagues ﬁrst evaluated the effects of metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced solid tumors (20).
Patients received cyclophosphamide, 50 mg orally given twice
a day, 1 week on and 1 week off for 1 month or more. The
number of circulating CD4þCD25high Tregs in the 9 patients
studied were higher at baseline compared with numbers in
healthy volunteers. After 1 month of cyclophosphamide treatment, CD4þCD25high T cells were decreased both in percentage
(7.9%–3.1%) and absolute numbers (28.7–6.4 cells/mm3). The
decrease occurred in all patients. Of the 4 patients with
adequate samples for evaluation, the number of FoxP3þ cells
also decreased. This decrease was selective and did not occur
in other T- or natural killer (NK)–cell subsets.
Cyclophosphamide's effect on T-cell and NK-cell function
was also evaluated. In addition to Teff inhibition, Tregs inhibit
innate immunity by downregulating NK-cell proliferation and
function. NK-cell lytic activity was tested after 1 month of

www.aacrjournals.org

metronomic cyclophosphamide by determining the capacity of
patients' NK cells to kill NKG2D ligand-expressing K562 cells.
NK activity in patients receiving cyclophosphamide was
enhanced and restored to healthy volunteer levels. T-cell
proliferation was also tested using carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester–labeled peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, either untreated or depleted of CD25þ T cells, and then
cultured with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for stimulation. Cyclophosphamide treatment also restored T-cell proliferation.
Metronomic cyclophosphamide was also evaluated in
patients with breast cancer, in whom it has historically been
used for its antiangiogenic properties. Patients with breast
cancer treated with continuous low-dose cyclophosphamide
had a transient reduction in Tregs lasting 4 to 6 weeks (21).
Patients received cyclophosphamide, 50 mg orally daily for 3
months. Tregs were reduced within 14 days (3.0% vs. 5.1%),
remained decreased until day 42, and returned to pretreatment
levels by day 84. Interestingly, endogenous breast tumor–
reactive T cells were detected in 27% of patients before
cyclophosphamide treatment and increased to 73% on day 14,
80% on day 42, and 88% on day 84. A total of 58% of patients had
stable disease. An increase in breast tumor–reactive T cells was
associated with both stable disease and overall survival.
Although Ghiringhelli and colleagues observed diminished
functionality of Tregs at 30 days, suppressive function changes
were only tested at 84 days and were not seen in this study (20).
Despite a transient and minimal effect on Treg numbers and
function, metronomic cyclophosphamide stably increased
breast tumor–reactive T-cell responses.
The use of metronomic cyclophosphamide combined with
active immunotherapy has recently been reported (22).
Patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with 3
different regimens of low-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with an oncolytic adenovirus. Cyclophosphamide was
given either as oral metronomic (50 mg/day), a single i.v.
injection (1,000 mg), or both. Metronomic cyclophosphamide
was given starting 1 week before the adenovirus, and i.v.
cyclophosphamide was given 1 hour prior to the adenovirus.
The adenovirus was injected intratumorally. Metronomic
cyclophosphamide (oral and oral þ i.v.) decreased Tregs and
induced antitumor or antiviral responses. All cyclophosphamide regimens resulted in higher rates of disease control when
compared with the rates for the adenovirus vaccine only. The
metronomic groups were most effective in decreasing Treg
numbers. However, prior studies with i.v. cyclophosphamide
would have predicted recovery of Treg numbers at the 30-day
time point evaluated. In addition, the dose of 1,000 mg
(approximately 600 mg/m2) is higher than the one used in
many studies. The i.v. cyclophosphamide was administered
only 1 hour prior to adenovirus administration. This timing
may be appropriate, as the kinetics of the immune response
induced by virus-induced tumor lysis differ from that of
peripherally administered vaccines. Although it may be difﬁcult to directly extrapolate these data to other vaccine strategies, it is important to note that all cyclophosphamide groups
did better than the patients getting adenovirus vaccine alone.
Although numerically, the best progression-free survival and
overall survival were seen in the oral þ i.v. group, the study was

not powered to compare the clinical outcomes between the
different groups. Numerous studies are in progress, combining
metronomic cyclophosphamide with active vaccination strategies (ClinicalTrials.gov) for a variety of cancers. These studies
are incorporating a range of immune analyses. Results from
these studies will inﬂuence future trial designs.

Downstream Effects of Treg Inhibition
In parallel to studying the optimal cyclophosphamide dose,
schedule, and route of administration required to optimally
modify Tregs, studies are exploring the mechanisms by which
cyclophosphamide modulates antitumor immunity. Enhancement of NK- and T-cell lytic activity and proliferation were
described above. To further elaborate on the downstream
effects on the antitumor T-cell response, Ercolini and colleagues reported on another mechanism of cyclophosphamide-mediated vaccine enhancement (23). Using HER2/neu
mice, which are tolerized to neu-expressing tumors, they found
that cyclophosphamide inhibited Tregs by selectively depleting
the cycling population of CD4þCD25þ T cells. Tetramerbinding studies showed that cyclophosphamide pretreatment
allowed activation of high-avidity HER-2/neu-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells, comparable to those generated in the parental strain
in which HER-2/neu is immunogenic. The discovery that
latent pools of high-avidity tumor-speciﬁc T cells can exist in
a tolerized host gives further credence to the potential for
active immunization in cancer.
The concept that Treg inhibition may recruit higher-avidity
effector T cells was further evaluated in a clinical trial in
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, testing an allogeneic, GM-CSF–pancreatic cancer vaccine given alone or in
sequence with low-dose cyclophosphamide (24). The GM-CSF
vaccine given 1 day after cyclophosphamide resulted in higher
rates of mesothelin-speciﬁc T-cell responses that were also of

higher avidity than those observed in patients treated with
vaccine alone. In addition, higher avidity T-cell responses were
associated with prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival in a heavily treated patient population (4.3 vs. 2.3
months overall survival).
In subsequent studies in HER2/neu mice, cyclophosphamide
was shown to exert its effects speciﬁcally by depleting a
CD25low Treg effector/memory subpopulation, which resides
in the tumor microenvironment and preferentially suppresses
high-avidity HER-2/neu-speciﬁc T cells (25). Effector/memorylike CD4þFoxP3þ Tregs preferentially hone to nonlymphoid
and inﬂamed tissues and are the predominant cells that trafﬁc
into tumors. CD25low Tregs express an activated phenotype
with higher levels of ICOS, CD44, CTLA-4, GITR, b1 integrin,
LFA1, and CXCR3 and lower levels of CD62L. In contrast,
CD25high Tregs are predominantly a lymph-node–residing
population. As a result of cyclophosphamide's effects on the
CD25low Treg subset, adoptively transferred high-avidity
HER-/2neu-speciﬁc T cells from vaccine plus cyclophosphamide-treated HER2/neu mice expressed higher tumor-trafﬁcking integrins and CXCR3 levels than did the T cells from
the no-cyclophosphamide group. This effect was not seen on
low-avidity T cells. Speciﬁc targeting of the most relevant
Treg subsets that are both present in the tumor microenvironment and capable of suppressing high-avidity tumorspeciﬁc T cells is extremely relevant in cancer-bearing hosts.
Ongoing research dissecting the roles of Treg subpopulations will allow further reﬁnement in approaches targeting
these suppressor subsets (Fig. 1).

Key Findings
Key ﬁndings in the use of cyclophosphamide in targeting
Tregs include the following: (i) Low-dose cyclophosphamide
(i.v.) results in transiently decreased Treg frequencies;

preferentially inhibit Treg subsets that suppress high-avidity tumor-speciﬁc T cells has implications for cancer immunotherapy.

likely to follow. Future studies should evaluate cyclophosphamide's effects on Treg-to-T-cell ratios in tumors and on
downstream immune responses. These results may be more
accurate indicators of clinical outcomes than observing
changes in systemic Treg numbers. Finally, the identiﬁcation
of speciﬁc Treg subsets responsible for effector T-cell suppression should lead to the development of more speciﬁc drugs that
alter these populations, leaving in place populations that
suppress autoimmunity.
