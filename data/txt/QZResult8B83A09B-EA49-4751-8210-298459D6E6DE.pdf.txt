Abstract
Although androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors prolong survival in castrate-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC), resistance rapidly develops and is often associated with increased stress-activated molecular chaperones
like clusterin (CLU) and continued AR signaling. Because adaptive pathways activated by treatment facilitate
development of acquired resistance, cotargeting the stress response, activated by AR inhibition and mediated
through CLU, may create conditional lethality and improve outcomes. Here, we report that CLU is induced by AR
antagonism and silencing using MDV3100 and antisense, respectively, to become highly expressed in castrateand MDV3100-resistant tumors and cell lines. CLU, as well as AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signalosomes, increase in response to MDV3100-induced stress. Mechanistically, this stress response is
coordinated by a feed-forward loop involving p90rsk (RPS6KA)-mediated phosphoactivation of YB-1 with
subsequent induction of CLU. CLU inhibition repressed MDV3100-induced activation of AKT and MAPK
pathways. In addition, when combined with MDV3100, CLU knockdown accelerated AR degradation and
repressed AR transcriptional activity through mechanisms involving decreased YB-1–regulated expression of
the AR cochaperone, FKBP52. Cotargeting the AR (with MDV3100) and CLU (with OGX-011) synergistically
enhanced apoptotic rates over that seen with MDV3100 or OGX-011 monotherapy and delayed CRPC LNCaP
tumor and prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) progression in vivo. These data indicate that cotargeting adaptive
stress pathways activated by AR pathway inhibitors, and mediated through CLU, creates conditional lethality and
provides mechanistic and preclinical proof-of-principle to guide biologically rational combinatorial clinical trial
design. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5206–17. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths
among males in western countries (1). Although early-stage
disease is treated with curative surgery or radiotherapy, the
mainstay of treatment for locally advanced, recurrent or
metastatic prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT), which reduces serum testosterone to castrate levels and
suppresses androgen receptor (AR) activity. Despite high initial
response rates after ADT, progression to castrate-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) occurs within 3 years (2–4). The AR
is the principle driver of CRPC (5), and is supported by ADTactivated growth factor signaling pathways (6), survival genes

(7), and cytoprotective chaperone networks (8). Docetaxel (9)
was the ﬁrst therapy to prolong survival in CRPC, stratifying
the treatment landscape into pre and postchemotherapy
states. More recently, the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone (10)
and the AR antagonist MDV3100 (11) have prolonged survival
and are rapidly changing the CRPC treatment landscape.
Despite signiﬁcant responses (11, 12), these novel AR pathway
inhibitors activate redundant survival pathways that adaptively drive treatment resistance and recurrent CRPC progression.
Realization of the full potential of AR pathway inhibition will
require characterization of these stress-activated survival
responses and rational combinatorial cotargeting strategies
designed to abrogate them.
Molecular chaperones play central roles in stress responses
by maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating prosurvival signaling and transcriptional networks. Clusterin (CLU), a
stress-activated chaperone transcriptionally regulated by
HSF1 (13), YB-1 (14), and others (15), inhibits stress-induced
apoptosis by suppressing protein aggregation (16), p53-activating stress signals (17), and conformationally altered Bax
(17, 18) while enhancing AKT phosphorylation (19) and
transactivation of NF-kB and HSF-1 (13, 20). CLU is expressed
in many human cancers (21, 22), including prostate where it
increases following castration to become highly expressed in

Cotargeting Androgen Receptor and Clusterin for CRPC

CRPC (23). CLU overexpression confers treatment resistance
(24), whereas CLU inhibition potentiates activity of most
anticancer therapies in many preclinical models (25–27). The
CLU inhibitor, OGX-011 (custirsen, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals), is currently in phase III trials after a randomized phase
II study in CRPC reported 7-month gain in overall survival and
50% reduced death rate (HR ¼ 0.50) when combined with
docetaxel (28).
Because CLU is induced by treatment stress, including
castration (23, 24), and functions as a key mediator of the
stress response (13), we hypothesized that cotargeting the AR
and stress-response pathways mediated by CLU may create
conditional lethality and improve cancer control. This study
was set out to correlate MDV3100 treatment stress and resistance with CLU induction, identify pathways regulating CLU
activation, and deﬁne mechanisms by which CLU inhibition
potentiates anti-AR therapy in CRPC.

Materials and Methods
Prostate cancer cell lines and reagents
LNCaP and C4-2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. L.W.K.
Chung (1992, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tx) and
authenticated by whole-genome and whole-transcriptome
sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx in July 2009. PC3
cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and authenticated by ATCC's isoenzyme analysis. CRPC
and MDV3100-resistant tumors and cell lines were generated
(Supplementary Fig. S1) as previously described (29). Cycloheximide and MG-132 were purchased from Calbiochem, R1881
from PerkinElmer, and MDV3100 from Haoyuan Chemexpress
Co., Limited. Antibodies used are listed in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
CLU siRNA and antisense
CLU and control siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc., as previously described (13). Secondgeneration CLU antisense (OGX-011) and scrambled (ScrB)
oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with a 20 -O-(2-methoxy)ethyl
modiﬁcation were supplied by OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals,
whereas AR antisense were supplied by Isis Pharmaceuticals; these are described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. Prostate cells were treated with CLU and YB-1
siRNA or oligonucleotides, using protocols described previously (13, 14).
Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation
Total proteins were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and submitted to Western blot analysis as
previously described (30). For immunoprecipitation, total proteins were precleared with protein-G sepharose (Invitrogen
Life Technologies), immunoprecipitated with 2 mg anti-AR, and
Western blotted as previously described (30).
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells after 48 hours of
treatment using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Inc.) as previously reported (13). Primers (described in Supplementary Materials and Methods) were normalized to b-actin

levels as an internal standard, and the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method was used to calculate relative quantiﬁcation of
target mRNAs. Each assay was conducted in triplicate.
Immunoﬂuorescence
LNCaP cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with
CLU siRNA or ScrB control. Forty-eight hours posttransfection,
cells were treated with 10 mmol/L MDV3100  1 nmol/L R1881
for 6 hours. Immunoﬂuorescence was conducted as previously
reported (30). Photomicrographs were taken at 20 magniﬁcation using Zeiss Axioplan II ﬂuorescence microscope,
followed by analysis with imaging software (Northern Eclipse,
Empix Imaging, Inc.).
AR transcription activity
LNCaP, CRPC-V16D, and MR49C cells (29) were treated
with OGX-011 or ScrB control, CLU siRNA or Ctr siRNA and
then transfected with PSA-luciferase reporter (6,100–þ12)
or Probasin luciferase reporter along with Renilla plasmid as
previously described (30). All experiments were carried out in
triplicate wells and repeated 5 times using different preparations of plasmids.
Cell proliferation and cell-cycle assays
LNCaP, MR49C, and MR49F cells (Supplementary Fig. S1)
were transfected with CLU siRNA, OGX-011, or ScrB control,
and then treated with MDV3100 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
control 24 hours after transfection. After a time course exposure, cell growth was measured by crystal violet assay as
previously described (30). Detection and quantitation of apoptotic cell-cycle population were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry as
previously described (30). Each assay was done in triplicate 3
times.
Crystal violet assay was used to determine synergism of
combination therapy. LNCaP cells were treated with 10
nmol/L CLU or ScrB siRNA, or 500 nmol/L OGX-011 or ScrB
ODN, and 1 day later combined with indicated concentration of MDV3100 or DMSO for 48 hours. CalcuSyn software
was used to calculate the combination index (CI) at several
effective doses (CI ¼ 1; additive effect, CI < 1; synergy effect,
CI > 1; antagonistic effect).
Protein stability and degradation
To assess the effect of combination treatment on AR protein
stability, LNCaP cells were treated with OGX-011 or ScrB for 48
hours followed by RPMIþ5% FBS plus 10 mmol/L cycloheximide and 10 mmol/L MDV3100 for 2 to 6 or 16 hours and
Western blotted using AR and vinculin antibodies.
Animal treatment
Male athymic mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) were
injected subcutaneoulsy with 1  106 LNCaP cells suspended
in Matrigel. When tumors reached 150 mm3, and serum
prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) was more than 50 ng/mL,
mice were castrated. Once tumors progressed to CRPC, mice
were randomly assigned to 10 mg/kg MDV3100 daily plus
either 10 mg/kg OGX-011 or ScrB ODN intraperitoneally once
daily for 7 days and then 3 times per week thereafter. Each

Results
CLU is highly expressed in MDV3100-resistant xenografts
and cell lines
To understand the mechanisms of MDV3100 recurrence, we
developed LNCaP-derived MDV3100-resistant tumors and cell
lines (Kuruma and colleagues; Supplementary Fig. S1) and
conﬁrmed that CLU levels were increased by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 1A, left) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A,
middle and right; ref. 29). Elevated CLU was also observed in
most MDV3100-resistant cell lines derived from these xenografts (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that CLU increases with
MDV3100 resistance, similar to comparisons between castrate
sensitive and CRPC tumors (24).

cells, with parallel induction of CLU (Fig. 1D). These data
suggest that AR pathway inhibition by ADT, AR antagonism,
or antisense knockdown induces CLU in castrate-sensitive and
-resistant cells, possibly as an early adaptive response to ARinhibited stress.

AR pathway inhibition induces CLU
We used MDV3100 and AR antisense approaches to assess
effects of AR pathway inhibition on CLU induction in
MDV3100-sensitive and -resistant LNCaP cells. Similar to
bicalutamide and ADT using charcoal stripped serum (Supplementary Fig. S2), MDV3100 induces CLU in both a timeand dose-dependent manner in castrate-sensitive LNCaP
(Fig. 1C) and castrate-resistant C4-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3)
cells, in parallel with reduced AR activity as indicated by
decreased PSA expression. These data suggest that MDV3100
induces activation of CLU, similar to that seen with ﬁrst-line
ADT in castrate-sensitive tumors (24). To determine whether
CLU is also induced as a consequence of AR inhibition even in
MDV3100-resistant cells, AR-ASO targeting exon 1 and intron 1
of the AR were used. Both AR-ASO potently downregulate AR in
a dose-dependent and sequence-speciﬁc manner in MR49F

We next set out to deﬁne transcriptional regulation of CLU
induction following MDV3100 treatment stress. We recently
reported that CLU is upregulated via YB-1 after treatment stress
(14); YB-1 is stress-activated via phosphorylation by AKT and
p90RSK (a RPS6KA multigene family member; refs. 31, 32),
stimulating its nuclear translocation. Although MDV3100 has
been reported to activate AKT (33), we found that MDV3100
also induces a downstream effector of extracellular signal-

ERK pathways can activate YB-1 (31, 32), we hypothesized that
MDV3100 induces CLU upregulation via phosphoactivation
of YB-1. Figure 2A conﬁrms that MDV3100 increases downstream effectors of AKT (pS6K) and Erk (p90Rsk), accompanied
by increased phospho-YB-1 levels. YB-1 silencing abrogates
MDV3100-induced CLU expression at both the protein and

is mediated by YB-1. Because YB-1 can be phosphoactivated by

synergistically enhances the inhibitory effect of MDV3100 on
cell growth in LNCaP (Fig. 3B) as well as C4-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4, top), but not in AR-negative PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4, bottom). Flow cytometric analysis indicates that OGX-011 combined with MDV3100 signiﬁcantly (P <

shown by cleaved PARP and caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3C, right).
Collectively, these data indicate that OGX-011 synergistically
enhances MDV3100-induced apoptosis.
Combined MDV3100 plus OGX-011 synergistically delays
CRPC LNCaP tumor growth
We next evaluated the in vivo effects of cotargeting the AR
and stress response using combined OGX-011 and MDV3100 in
CRPC LNCaP model. Male nude mice bearing LNCaP xenografts were castrated when serum PSA reached 75 ng/mL and
followed until serum PSA and tumor growth rates increased

resistance. Mice were then randomly assigned for treatment
with MDV3100 plus either control (n ¼ 12) or OGX-011 (n ¼
12). At baseline, mean LNCaP tumor volume and serum PSA
levels were similar in both groups. OGX-011 signiﬁcantly
enhanced the antitumor effect of MDV3100, reducing mean
tumor volume from 1,600 to 650 mm3 by 12 weeks ( , P  0.05),
compared with control (Fig. 4A and C). Mean serum PSA levels
were also signiﬁcantly lower (4-fold) in the OGX-011þMDV3100 group compared with MDV3100þcontrol group (P <
0.001; Fig. 4B and D). Waterfall plots (Fig. 4C and D) illustrate
more frequent tumor volume, and serum PSA decreases in the
combination group. Overall survival (deﬁned as euthanasia for
tumor volume exceeding 10% of body weight) was signiﬁcantly
prolonged with combined MDV-3100þOGX-011 compared
with MDV3100þcontrol (90% vs. 30% at week 16, respectively;
P  0.05). These data show that cotargeting the AR and the
induced CLU-mediated stress response potentiates MDV3100
activity in a human CRPC xenograft model.

inhibited AR-regulated gene expression, which was maximally
reduced by combination therapy (Fig. 5B). In keeping with these
observations, immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 5C) and subcellular

cells (Supplementary Fig. S6, right) as well as in LAPC4 and
22RV1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7); these changes are seen at
the protein, but not mRNA levels (Fig. 6A, bottom) and
enhanced by MDV3100, suggesting that CLU knockdown in
combination with MDV3100 alters AR protein stability. The
effect of CLU silencing /þMDV3100 on AR biosynthesis using
cycloheximide was next evaluated. Both MDV3100 and CLU
siRNA induced rapid and profound decrease of AR 6 hours after
cyclohexamide, whereas this effect was seen after only 2 hours
when MDV3100 was combined with CLU knockdown (Fig. 6B).
These data suggest that CLU silencing and MDV3100, both
decrease AR protein turnover, but this effect is potentiated
when combined.
Protein ubiquitination and acetylation are important determinants of AR transcriptional activation (35, 36). AR forms a
heterodimer complex with Hsp90 to provide stability for
ligand-unbound AR; without Hsp90 binding, the AR is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (37, 38). We found
that MDV3100 increases AR-Hsp90 heterocomplex levels (Fig.
6C), consistent with prior reports that MDV3100 sequesters AR
in the cytoplasm (11), with decreased AR acetylation (Fig. 6C)
and AR transcriptional activity (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, CLU
knockdown profoundly decreases AR/Hsp90 heterocomplex
and AR acetylation levels (Fig. 6C). These data are consistent
with a view that the MDV3100-AR-Hsp90 heterocomplex
becomes more vulnerable to degradation under conditions of
CLU silencing. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132, abrogated
AR degradation under conditions of CLU knockdown plus
MDV3100 (Fig. 6D, left) with increased ubiquitinated AR levels
(Fig. 6D, middle and right). Collectively, these data suggest that
when CLU knockdown is combined with MDV3100, the AR is
deacetylated and ubiquitinated with accelerated proteasomemediated degradation.
CLU knockdown decreases levels of the molecular
cochaperone FKBP52
The preceding data indicate that MDV3100-sequestered, ARHsp90 cytoplasmic heterocomplexes, when combined with CLU
knockdown, are destabilized and lead to AR ubiquitination and
degradation with reduced AR nuclear translocation and activity. One explanation is that CLU inhibition may lower Hsp90
levels through its regulation of HSF-1 activity (13); however,
MDV3100 did not induce HSF-1 activity (Supplementary Fig.
S8), and combination therapy did not lower the levels of the
HSF-1–regulated gene, Hsp90 (Fig. 6C, input). These observations, along with data in Fig. 2, implicate YB-1, rather than HSF1, as the key stress-activated transcription factor mediating
MDV3100 increases of CLU. Because Hsp90 cooperates with
other cochaperones to stabilize client proteins, we initially used
an unbiased approach to identify AR-Hsp90 cochaperones
regulated by CLU. Gene proﬁling analysis from LNCaP and
PC-3 cells treated with control versus CLU siRNA indicated that
CLU expression correlated with the Hsp90 cochaperone
FKBP52 (Hsp56) and that CLU knockdown reduces FKBP52,
but not FKBP51 or Hsp90, protein levels while abrogating
MDV3100-induced phosphorylation of YB-1, pAKT, and p90Rsk
(Fig. 7A). To deﬁne how FKBP52 levels decrease under conditions of MDV3100-induced stress and CLU knockdown, we

5214

Cancer Res; 73(16) August 15, 2013

mined public databases and found that YB-1 binds to FKBP52
DNA with a high stringency of 12 in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on ChIP analysis (39). Western blotting conﬁrmed that YB-1 knockdown decreases FKBP52 expression
levels (Fig. 7B). To ascertain the role of FKBP52 in AR stability
under conditions of CLU silencing, FKBP52 was overexpressed
after CLU knockdown and AR expression was evaluated. Figure
7C shows that FKBP52 partially rescues AR from degradation
induced by CLU knockdown. FKBP52 overexpression also
partially restores PSA expression, indicating increased AR
activity when FKBP52 levels are restored under conditions of
CLU knockdown. These data suggest that CLU regulates the
stability of the AR–cochaperone complex by affecting FKBP52
levels. Although FKBP52 rescue can partially reverse CLU
knockdown effects on AR stability in the absence of MDV3100,
AR levels were not rescued when MDV3100 was present (Fig.
7C). These data deﬁne an MDV3100-induced feed-forward loop
involving pYB-1, p90rsk, CLU, and the AR cochaperone FKBP52
that collectively support AR stability, nuclear translocation, and
activation that may be cotargeted using OGX-011.

Discussion
Many strategies used to kill cancer cells induce stress and
redundant survival responses that promote survival and
emergence of treatment resistance, which is the underlying
basis for most cancer deaths. This therapeutic resistance
results from the Darwinian interplay of innate and adaptive
survival pathways activated by selective pressures of treatment. In prostate cancer, castration induces apoptosis and
clinical responses in most patients but also triggers progression to CRPC (2, 3). Similarly, newer AR pathway
inhibitors like abiraterone and MDV3100 prolong survival
but resistance develops in many initial responders (11,
12, 40). Disease progression frequently correlates with rising
PSA levels, indicating continued AR signaling and highlighting need for additional therapies targeting the molecular
basis of treatment-resistant CRPC. Deﬁning interactions
between the AR and redundant survival pathways will build
new combinatorial strategies that control progression and
improve outcomes.
Persistent AR signaling in CRPC can occur via AR ampliﬁcation or mutations, as well as altered levels of AR coactivators
or cochaperones (41–44). Another more dynamic mechanism
involves reciprocal feedback regulation between AR and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways whereby AR inhibition
activates AKT signaling by reducing the levels of the AKT
phosphatase PHLPP, and PI3K inhibition activates AR signaling by relieving feedback inhibition of HER kinases; inhibition
of one activates the other, thereby enhancing survival (33).
These insights guide design of combinatorial regimens cotargeting the AR pathway and AKT or Hsp chaperones Hsp90 and
Hsp27 (45).
Because AR pathway inhibition is known to induce stress
and CLU with reciprocal pathway activation of AKT (34),
targeting the stress response activated by AR pathway inhibitors is another combinatorial strategy. This study deﬁnes feedforward links between stress-induced YB-1 to CLU activation
in parallel with enhanced AKT and mitogen-activated protein

kinase (MAPK) signaling, which collectively support AR stability and activity during MDV3100 treatment. YB-1 and CLU
are both stress-activated survival chaperones functionally
associated with cancer treatment resistance (14). Under stress
conditions, YB-1 is phosphoactivated by AKT (31) and p90RSK
(32), stimulating its nuclear translocation and binding to target
promoters. Our ﬁndings identify p90RSK as the predominant
pathway increasing CLU expression after MDV3100 treatment,
whereas YB-1 knockdown abrogates MDV3100-induced CLU.
We previously reported that YB-1 transcriptionally enhances
CLU following treatment stress and CLU functions as a key
mediator of paclitaxel resistance in prostate cancer (14).
Together, these data suggest that MDV3100-induced CLU
occurs via p90RSK and YB-1 signaling pathway.
This stress-activated antiapoptotic function for CLU can lead
to resistance to many anticancer therapies. The CLU antisense
inhibitor, OGX-011, enhances cancer cell death in combination
with therapeutic stressors in many preclinical cancer models
(15). Phase III trials evaluating combined docetaxel plus OGX011 are underway in men with metastatic CRPC after randomized phase II studies reported a survival beneﬁt when OGX-011
was added to docetaxel (15). Although CLU inhibition can
enhance castration and delay time to CRPC in castrate-sensitive
xenografts (24, 46), MDV3100 now enables investigation of AR
pathway and CLU inhibition in CRPC models. In this study, we
show that CLU is induced by MDV3100 and AR knockdown in
MDV-sensitive and -resistant LNCaP cells, respectively, and that

CLU remained highly expressed in most MDV3100-resistant
xenografts and cell lines. Mechanistically, MDV3100-induced
cross-talk activation of AKT and MAPK pathways was repressed
when combined with OGX-011, and cotargeting AR and CLU
synergistically enhanced apoptotic rates over monotherapy.
Unexpectedly, we found that AR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation rates were accelerated when
MDV3100 was combined with CLU knockdown. Stress activation of YB-1 and MAPK was blunted with combined therapy,
resulting in decreased YB-1–regulated levels of FKBP52 (Hsp56),
which led to AR ubiquitination, proteasomal degradation and
decreased transcriptional activity beyond that observed with
MDV3100 monotherapy.
These results highlight a role for CLU in supporting YB-1–
mediated expression of other molecular chaperones under
context-dependent stress conditions, analogous to CLU-enhanced HSF-1–mediated transactivation of Hsp70 and Hsp27
after Hsp90 inhibition (13). HSF-1 and YB-1 orchestrate expression of other molecular chaperones involved in processes of
folding, trafﬁcking, and transcriptional activation of the AR. In
the absence of ligand, AR is predominately cytoplasmic, maintained in an inactive, but highly responsive state by a large
dynamic heterocomplex composed of Hsp90 and Hsp70, and
cochaperones like FKBP52. These Hsp-AR cochaperones support AR stability and activation (47, 48). Compared with the
ﬁrst-generation AR antagonist bicalutamide, which leads to AR
dissociation from its Hsp heterocomplex and does not inhibit

AR nuclear transport, MDV3100-bound AR remains cytoplasmic and complexed with Hsp90, which may increase AR
susceptibility to degradation under conditions of stress and
CLU suppression. MDV3100-induced changes in AR acetylation and/or conformation may render it dependent to other
cofactors in addition to FKBP52.
In summary, we deﬁne a stress-induced feed-forward loop
involving MDV3100-induced AKT and p90rsk, phosphoactivation of YB-1, and increased expression of CLU. CLU knockdown
abrogates MDV3100-induced activation of both AKT and
p90rsk, deﬁning another mechanism by which CLU inhibition
potentiates anti-AR therapy. Hence, cotargeting adaptive stress
pathways activated by AR pathway inhibitors, and mediated
through CLU, potentiate anti-AR activity by decreasing AR
expression levels and activity, as well as activation of cross-talk
signaling pathways induced by MDV3100. These results provide mechanistic and preclinical proof-of-principle to support
combinatorial clinical studies with MDV3100 and OGX-011.
