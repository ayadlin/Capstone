Abstract
RSK

The ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2), a member of the p90
(RSK) family of proteins, is a widely expressed serine/
threonine kinase that is activated by extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
1 in response to many growth factors and peptide hormones.
Its activation signaling enhances cell survival. However, the
roles of RSK2 in cell transformation have not yet been
elucidated. Here, we found that RSK2 is a critical serine/
threonine kinase for the regulation of cell transformation.
When cells were stimulated with tumor promoters, such as
epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylation of RSK was increased
within 5 min. Cell proliferation was suppressed in RSK2 /
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with RSK2+/+
MEFs. Moreover, RSK2 / MEFs accumulated at the G1 phase
of the cell cycle under normal cell culture conditions as well
as after stimulation with EGF or TPA. In the anchorageindependent cell transformation assay (soft agar), stable
expression of RSK2 in JB6 cells significantly enhanced colony
formation in either the presence or absence of tumor
promoters. Furthermore, knockdown of RSK2 with small
interfering RNA-RSK2 suppressed constitutively active Ras
(RasG12V)-induced foci formation in NIH3T3 cells. In addition,
kaempferol, an inhibitor of RSK2, suppressed EGF-induced
colony formation of JB6 Cl41 cells in soft agar, which was
associated with inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation
(Ser10). These results showed that RSK2 is a key regulator for
cell transformation induced by tumor promoters such as EGF
and TPA. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8104–12]

Introduction
The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are important
regulators of proliferation and oncogenesis (1, 2). The MAPK
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (3, 4) mediates the
90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK), which are a family of widely
expressed serine/threonine kinases that respond to many growth
factors, peptide hormones, and neurotransmitters (5, 6). When
activated, RSK2 is translocated to the nucleus, where it can
phosphorylate various nuclear proteins, including c-Fos, Elk-1,
histones, cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein (CREB;
refs. 7–11), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4; ref. 12), and p53 (13).

The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and phorbol ester, 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), are well-known tumor promotion agents used to study malignant transformation in cell and animal
models of cancer (14). Either of these two agents can induce activation
of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1; refs. 15, 16). When
treated with TPA or EGF, JB6 Cl41 skin epidermal cells show an
induction of AP-1 transcriptional activation in promotion-sensitive
(P+) phenotypes but not in promotion-resistant (P ) phenotypes (17).
Blocking AP-1 activation causes P+ cells to revert to the P phenotype,
indicating a unique requirement for AP-1 activation in TPA- or EGFinduced cell transformation (18).
Recent studies have indicated that RSK2 is involved in the
survival of neurons that have been treated with a survival growth
factor, brain-derived neutrophic factor, mediated through phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD (Ser112; ref. 19).
Moreover, RSK2 knockout mice display reduction of c-Fos–
dependent osteosarcoma formation through the regulation of
c-Fos protein stability (20). Furthermore, SL0101, a selective RSK2
inhibitor extracted from the tropical plant Forsteronia refracta, has
been shown to inhibit RSK2 activity and suppress proliferation of
MCF-7 breast cancer cells or LNCaP prostate cancer cells (21, 22).
Although RSK2 is believed to be involved in cancer cell
proliferation and osteosarcoma development (20–22), a role for
RSK2 in cell transformation induced by tumor promoters, such as
EGF or TPA, has not been reported.
Here, we showed that RSK2 is a key regulator for tumor
promoter–induced cell transformation. Ectopic expression of RSK2
in JB6 Cl41 cells caused increased proliferation as well as
anchorage-independent transformation. Furthermore, knockdown
of RSK2 by siRNA almost totally blocked foci formation in NIH3T3
cells. These results showed that RSK2 is a key regulator of cell
transformation induced by tumor promoters such as EGF or TPA.

Figure 1. RSK2 is regulated by tumor promoters such as EGF and TPA.
HaCat cells (1  106) were seeded into 10-cm dishes and then cultured
overnight. Cells were subsequently starved in 0.1% FBS-DMEM for 24 h and
then stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF (A) or 10 ng/mL TPA (B) and harvested at
the indicated time point. The proteins were extracted with NP40 cell lysis buffer

The annealed synthetic primers were then introduced following the
recommended protocols.1 The recombinant plasmids of pHisG-RSK2 and
psi-RSK2 were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA
sequencing.
Cell culture and transfections. HaCat, RSK2+/+, and RSK2 / mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; a generous gift from Dr. J.C. Bruning, Institute
for Genetics, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany)
were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and antibiotics at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator. JB6 Cl41 mouse skin
epidermal cells were cultured in 5% FBS-MEM. NIH3T3 cells were cultured
10% calf serum in DMEM. The cells were maintained by splitting at 90%
confluence and media were changed every 3 days. When cells reached 50%
to 60% confluence, transfection of the expression vectors was done using
LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s suggested
protocol.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay. To estimate cell proliferation, RSK2+/+
and RSK2 / MEFs were seeded (1  103) into 96-well plates in 100 AL
of 10% FBS-MEM and incubated in a 37jC, 5% CO2 incubator. JB6 Cl41
cells stably transfected with the mock vector or pHisG-RSK2 were seeded
(1  103) into 96-well plates in 100 AL of 5% FBS-MEM and incubated in a
37jC, 5% CO2 incubator. After culturing for 12 h, 20 AL of the CellTiter96
Aqueous One Solution (Promega) were added to each well and cells were

then incubated for 1 h at 37jC and 5% CO2. To stop the reaction, 25 AL of a 10%
SDS solution were added and absorbance was measured at 490 and 690 nm.
Anchorage-independent cell transformation assay. EGF- or TPAinduced cell transformation was investigated in mock or pHisG-RSK2 stably
transfected cells. In brief, cells (8  103/mL) were exposed to EGF (0.1–10 ng/mL)
or TPA (0.1–10 ng/mL) in 1 mL of 0.3% basal medium Eagle (BME) agar
containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained in a 37jC, 5% CO2 incubator
for 10 days (EGF) or 3 to 4 weeks (TPA), and the cell colonies were scored using a
microscope and the Image-Pro PLUS (version 4) computer software program
(Media Cybernetics) as described by Colburn et al. (23).
Focus-forming assay. Transformation of NIH3T3 cells was conducted
according to standard protocols (24). Cells were transiently transfected with
combinations of pcDNA3-H-RasG12V (50 ng), pHisG-RSK2 (450 ng), psi-RSK2
(450 ng) DNA, and pcDNA3-mock (compensation to achieve equal amount
of DNA) DNA and then cultured in 5% FBS-DMEM for 2 weeks. Foci were
fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted with a microscope
and the Image-Pro PLUS (version 4) software program.
Cell cycle analysis. RSK2+/+ or RSK2 / MEFs (2  105) were seeded
into 60-mm dishes and cultured for 36 h at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator. The
cell was starved for 24 h with 0.1% FBS-DMEM and then stimulated with
EGF (10 ng/mL) or TPA (10 ng/mL) for 12 h. The cells were harvested with
trypsin, fixed with ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and then
analyzed for cell cycle phase by flow cytometry.
In vitro kination assay. GST-NFAT3D4-261-365 or GST-CREB2 protein
was used for an in vitro kination assay with active RSK2 (Upstate
Biotechnology). Reactions were carried out at 30jC for 30 min in a mixture
containing 10 Amol/L unlabeled ATP and 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP and then
stopped by adding 6 SDS sample buffer. For the inhibitory effect of
kaempferol on RSK2 activity, we used 10 Amol/L unlabeled ATP and 10 ACi
[g-32P]ATP. Samples were boiled and then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and
visualized by autoradiography, Western blotting, or Coomassie blue
staining.
Western blotting. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were
resolved by the appropriate percentage SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were
incubated in blocking buffer and then probed with specific primary
antibodies against phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated RSK, total ERK,
total histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology), total RSK2, phosphorylated
histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), or h-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) and the
appropriate anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as the
secondary antibody. The Western blots were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences Corp.).
Extraction of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. To analyze histone
H3 phosphorylation, RSK2+/+, RSK2 / , and JB6 Cl41 cells were seeded in
10-cm dishes and cultured to about 90% to 95% confluence. The cells were
starved for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) either with or
without various concentrations of kaempferol over different times. The cells
were harvested and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted with
the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) following
the manufacturer’s suggested protocols. To obtain nuclear extracts
containing histone H3, the nuclear fractions were treated with 250 units
benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min on ice. Samples were mixed for 15 s
by vortex every 10 min and the supernatant fraction was recovered by
centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min at 4jC). The supernatant fraction was the
nuclear fraction containing histone proteins. To detect histone H3
phosphorylation (Ser10) and total histone H3 protein, 2 Ag of total nuclear
fraction protein were used for Western blot analysis.

Results
RSK is regulated by the tumor promoters EGF or TPA. The
MAPK signaling pathway not only promotes cell proliferation but
also mediates cell survival and is up-regulated in various cancer
cells (25). We hypothesized that RSK, which is an ERK downstream
serine/threonine protein kinase, might play a key role in cell
transformation. To examine whether RSK is regulated by tumor
promoters, such as EGF or TPA, HaCat cells were starved for

24 h with 0.1% FBS-DMEM and then stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL)
or TPA (10 ng/mL). Results indicated that phosphorylation and
activation of ERK were increased at 5 min, maintained to 60 min, and
decreased at 120 min after EGF or TPA treatment (Fig. 1A and B).
The phosphorylation of RSK was first detected at 5 min, gradually
increased to 120 min, and then decreased at 240 min after EGF or
TPA treatment (Fig. 1A and B). Total RSK protein level was also
increased in a time-dependent manner with EGF or TPA treatment
(Fig. 1A and B). Furthermore, the RSK2 protein level was increased
in a manner similar to ERK and RSK. These results indicated that
the tumor promoters EGF and TPA activated the ERK-RSK signaling
pathway, including RSK2.

RSK2 deficiency suppresses cell proliferation by causing
accumulation of cells at G1. The Ras-ERK signaling pathway
regulates cell survival (25) and the MAPK cascades are implicated
in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, growth and motility
(26, 27), as well as tumorigenesis (28). We hypothesized that RSK2
deficiency would affect cell proliferation. To examine this idea, we
confirmed the RSK2 protein level in RSK2+/+ and RSK2 / MEFs by
Western blot (Fig. 2A). The RSK2 protein was confirmed to be
absent in RSK2 / MEFs. Therefore, we analyzed proliferation in
cells cultured under normal conditions with 10% FBS. The results
indicated that RSK2 deficiency suppressed cell proliferation by
f41% compared with RSK2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2B). Moreover, we found

resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were hybridized with an RSK2 antibody and the appropriate secondary antibody
and then visualized using the ECL detection kit. Equal protein loading was confirmed using the h-actin antibody on the same membrane. B, RSK2+/+ and RSK2 /
MEFs were seeded (1  103 per well) into 96-well plates in 100 AL of 10% FBS-DMEM and proliferation was assessed using the CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution

that RSK2 / MEFs showed less cells in S phase and a greater
accumulation of cells in the G1-G0 phase of the cell cycle compared
with RSK2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2C). Stimulation with EGF or TPA resulted
in a stimulation of cells in S phase for RSK2+/+ MEFs but had no
effect on the cell cycle progression of RSK2 / MEFs (Fig. 2D).
These results clearly showed that RSK2 deficiency suppressed cell
proliferation because of an impaired G1-S cell cycle transition.
Ectopic expression of RSK2 induces anchorage-independent
cell transformation. The MAPK pathway controls the growth and

survival of a broad spectrum of human tumors. Mutations in Ras or
Raf result in activation of the MAPK pathway and are present in a
large percentage of solid tumors (25). As indicated above, RSK2
plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell cycle
regulation (Fig. 2). Therefore, we hypothesized that RSK2 might
play a key role in cell transformation. To examine this idea, we
established stably expressed RSK2 in JB6 Cl41 cells and analyzed
cell proliferation. The results showed that RSK2 expression
increased cell proliferation (Fig. 3A), which supported our previous

results (Fig. 2B). Mock or RSK2 stable cell lines were subjected to
the soft agar assay with stimulation by EGF (10 ng/mL) or TPA
(10 ng/mL) to assess cell transformation. Surprisingly, RSK2overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells showed about a 15-fold increase in
anchorage-independent colony formation even without EGF or
TPA stimulation compared with mock JB6 Cl41 stable cells (Fig. 3B
and C, top). Furthermore, EGF or TPA stimulation further increased
colony formation in soft agar in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B
and C, bottom). These results showed that RSK2 plays an important
role in cell transformation.
Knockdown of RSK2 blocks foci formation. To examine the
role of endogenous RSK2 in cell transformation, we designed siRNA
against RSK2 (si-RSK2) and a general scrambled mock control
(si-mock; Fig. 4A) for transfection into NIH3T3 cells. Western blot
results revealed that si-RSK2 down-regulated the endogenous RSK2
protein level by f85% (Fig. 4B). To test the effect of knocking
down RSK2 on constitutively active Ras (RasG12V )-induced cell
transformation, we transfected various combinations of the
expression vectors into NIH3T3 cells and then analyzed the effect
on foci formation. The results showed that, as expected, RasG12V
induced cell transformation in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4C, top right and

graph). Moreover, coexpression of RasG12V and RSK2 induced even
more foci formation in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4C, bottom left and
graph). Importantly, cotransfection of si-RSK2 with RasG12V or
RasG12V/RSK2 almost totally blocked foci formation in NIH3T3 cells
(Fig. 4C, bottom middle and right and graph). These results further
showed that RSK2 plays a key role in cell transformation. To
examine whether the inhibitory effect of RSK2 knockdown on foci
formation was related to a suppression of cell proliferation, we
established NIH3T3 cells stably expressing RasG12V or mock. The
mock or RasG12V stable cells were then reintroduced with si-mock
(mock/si-mock or Ras/si-mock) or si-RSK2 (mock/si-RSK2 or Ras/
si-RSK2), respectively, and cell proliferation was then analyzed. The
results indicated that si-RSK2 transfection into the mock stable cell
line (mock/si-RSK2) suppressed cell proliferation by f20%
compared with si-mock control cells (mock/si-mock; Fig. 4D).
Notably, RasG12V stable cells transfected with si-mock (Ras/simock) showed an increase in cell proliferation by f16% compared
with the mock stable cell line (mock/si-mock; Fig. 4D). However,
introducing si-RSK2 into RasG12V stable cells (Ras/si-RSK2)
suppressed cell proliferation to a level about the same as the
mock stable cell line (mock/si-mock; Fig. 4D). Taken together, we

in vitro. Active RSK2 (10 ng) was combined with GST-NFAT3-261-365 (2 Ag), 10 Amol/L unlabeled ATP, 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP, and the indicated dose of kaempferol. An
in vitro phosphorylation assay was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. Band density was measured using the ImageJ computer program and band

with 20 ng GST-CREB2, 10 Amol/L unlabeled ATP, 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP, and 7 Amol/L kaempferol. The kinase reaction was carried out as described in Materials
and Methods. The 32P radioisotope-labeled GST-CREB2 protein bands were visualized by autoradiography. C, kaempferol suppresses cell proliferation. JB6 Cl41 cells
(8  103) were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured for 12 h. The cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of kaempferol (0–60 Amol/L in DMSO)
and proliferation was determined using the CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution detection kit. Cell proliferation was estimated by reading absorbance (A490) at
24-h intervals up to 48 h. The quenching of chemical background for absorbance was obtained by subtracting the absorbance value of kaempferol-treated medium
without cells from the kaempferol-treated medium with cells. Points, mean of values obtained from six replicate experiments; bars, SD. Significant differences

reduction of cell transformation.
Kaempferol, an inhibitor of RSK2, suppresses cell proliferation and EGF-induced transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells.

on RSK2 kinase activity in vitro toward the NFAT3 protein, which is
a novel substrate of RSK2 (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 31). We found
that kaempferol inhibited RSK2 in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5A). Next to examine whether kaempferol has specificity for
RSKs, we constructed a GST-CREB2 fusion expression vector
(pGST-CREB2), which is a common substrate of RSKs (Supplementary Fig. S2). This was expressed in BL21 and partially purified
and then directly subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with RSK1,
RSK2, or RSK3 using [g-32P]ATP and 7 Amol/L kaempferol. This
concentration of kaempferol was shown to be effective in inhibiting
RSK2 activity by f50% (Fig. 5A and B, bottom) but had no effect on
RSK1 or RSK3 activity (Fig. 5B, top and middle). These results
indicated that kaempferol has a specific inhibitory effect on RSK2
at this concentration. The toxicity of kaempferol against JB6 Cl41

cells (8  104 per well in 96-well plates) was assessed over varying
periods. Results indicated that the highest concentration of
kaempferol (60 Amol/L) had no cytotoxic effect at 48 h after
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). Next to examine whether
kaempferol can inhibit cell proliferation, we analyzed cell proliferation with different doses of kaempferol over varying periods. The
results showed that kaempferol suppressed cell growth in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5C) and cell death was not
observed (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that doses of
kaempferol up to 60 Amol/L were not toxic but inhibited cell
proliferation. We next investigated the effect of kaempferol on EGFstimulated colony formation in the anchorage-independent cell
transformation assay. JB6 Cl41 cells were stimulated with EGF
(10 ng/mL) with or without a combination of different doses of
kaempferol for 10 days. The results showed that EGF and/or DMSO
alone had no effect on colony formation (Fig. 5D). On the other hand,
kaempferol had an inhibitory effect of f44% at 30 Amol/L and 75%
at 60 Amol/L concentrations (Fig. 5D, right and graph). These results
indicated that kaempferol suppressed cell proliferation as well as
EGF-induced cell transformation.
RSK2 is a key regulator of histone H3 phosphorylation. Our
previous studies indicated that RSK2 phosphorylated histone H3 at
Ser10 when induced by EGF or UVB (13). Furthermore, the
phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 was shown to be
indispensable for neoplastic cell transformation induced by EGF
(32). Therefore, we examined the inhibitory effect of kaempferol on
RSK2 by analyzing histone H3 phosphorylation (Ser10) in vivo.
Results confirmed that EGF induced histone H3 phosphorylation
(Ser10; Fig. 6A). Moreover, we found that EGF-induced histone H3
phosphorylation (Ser10) was inhibited by f50% by treatment with

Figure 6. Histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 is eliminated by inhibition of
RSK2. A, kaempferol inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10. JB6 Cl41
cells (1  106) were seeded into 10-cm dishes in 5% FBS-MEM and cultured until
cells reached 90% to 95% confluence. The cells were starved for 24 h in
0.1% FBS-MEM and then stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) for 15 min and
subsequently harvested. The nuclear and cytosolic fractions were extracted with
NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) following the
manufacturer’s suggested protocols. To extract histone proteins, the nuclear
fraction was treated with benzonase (250 units) for 30 min on ice and then the
supernatant fraction was recovered by centrifugation. The nuclear fraction
containing histone proteins was used for histone H3 detection and the cytosolic
fraction was used for detection of ERK by Western blotting as described in
Materials and Methods. Equal protein loading was confirmed using the h-actin
antibody on the same membrane. B, RSK2 knockdown suppresses EGFinduced histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10. NIH3T3 cells were transfected
with psi-mock or psi-RSK2, cultured and starved each for 24 h, and then
stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL). The cells were harvested at the indicated time
point and histone protein was extracted as described for (A ). Phosphorylated
and total histone H3 proteins were visualized from the nuclear fraction by
Western blotting using specific antibodies. The phosphorylated ERK, total ERK,
and total RSK2 proteins were visualized from the cytosolic fraction by Western
blotting with specific antibodies and equal protein loading was confirmed using
the h-actin antibody on the same membrane. C, RSK2 / MEFs contain lower
levels of the histone H3 protein. Histone proteins were extracted from RSK2+/+
and RSK2 / MEFs as described for (A). Total proteins (2 or 4 Ag) were resolved
by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and visualized using a
total histone H3 antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as described
in Materials and Methods. Equal protein loading was confirmed using the
h-actin antibody on the same membrane. D, RSK2 deficiency blocks
EGF-induced histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10. RSK2+/+ and RSK2 / MEFs
(1  106) were seeded into 10-cm dishes, cultured to about 90% to 95%
confluence, and subsequently starved in 0.1% FBS-DMEM for 24 h. The cells
were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) and harvested at the indicated time point,
and then histone proteins were extracted as described for (A). Western blotting
was conducted using 2 or 10 Ag of nuclear protein from RSK2+/+ and RSK2 /
MEFs as indicated. The levels of phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10) and total
histone H3 protein level were visualized by Western blot using specific antibodies
as described in Materials and Methods. Equal protein loading was confirmed
using the h-actin antibody on the same membrane.

RSK2-Mediated Cell Transformation

30 Amol/L kaempferol and was almost totally blocked at 60 Amol/L
kaempferol (Fig. 6A). However, phosphorylation of ERK induced by
EGF was not changed (Fig. 6A), indicating that kaempferol does
not affect the activity of ERK or ERK upstream kinases, including
EGF receptor (EGFR), Ras/Raf, or MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK). ERK is
an upstream MAPK of RSK2, which further suggests that
kaempferol specifically inhibits RSK2 activity. To examine whether
siRNA-RSK2 suppresses EGF-induced histone H3 phosphorylation
(Ser10), we introduced si-RSK2 into NIH3T3 cells and analyzed the
effect of knocking down RSK2 expression. The results indicated
that si-RSK2 transfection into cells suppressed EGF-induced
histone H3 phosphorylation (Ser10) as well as suppressing total
histone H3 protein levels (Fig. 6B) compared with si-mock cells.
However, total and phosphorylated ERK proteins were not changed
in either cell line, indicating that inhibition of EGF-induced histone
H3 phosphorylation in si-RSK2–transfected cells was a specific
effect of RSK2 knockdown (Fig. 6B). To test whether RSK2
deficiency affects total histone H3 level, we assessed total protein
level by Western blot in RSK2+/+ and RSK2 / MEFs. The results
indicated that histone H3 protein level was lower in RSK2 / MEFs
compared with RSK2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 6C). To analyze whether RSK2
deficiency can block EGF-induced histone H3 phosphorylation
(Ser10), we used 2 or 10 Ag of protein from a nuclear fraction from
RSK2+/+ MEFs or RSK2 / MEFs, respectively, for the Western blot
analysis. The results indicated that phosphorylation of histone H3
(Ser10) was very weak in RSK2 / MEFs, although five times more
protein was used compared with RSK2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 6D). Taken
together, these results provide strong evidence showing that RSK2
is a key regulator of EGF- or TPA-induced cell transformation,
which might be regulated through RSK2-mediated histone H3
phosphorylation at Ser10.

Discussion
Various environmental stimuli activate MAPK cascades, which
regulate many cellular responses that result in the transcriptional
activation of immediate-early response genes (IEG; ref. 33). The rapid
induction of IEG by external stimuli is associated with the delivery of
intracellular signals to transcription factors and cofactors at regulatory
elements as well as nucleosomes present both at the promoter and
within the transcribed region of genes (34). In particular, the Ras/ERK
pathway has a critical role in regulating cell proliferation, survival,
growth and motility (26, 27), and tumorigenesis (28).
The MAPKs comprise a family of proteins that mediate a series
of distinct signaling cascades, which are targeted by a multitude of
extracellular stimuli. Activated MAPKs translocate to the nucleus,
where they phosphorylate their target molecules, including various
transcription factors and histone H3 (35). Constitutive activation of
MAPK-related oncogenes, such as H-ras, increases the level of
phosphorylated H3 in mouse fibroblasts (36, 37). Several reports
have confirmed that the MAPK cascades are key players in the
nucleosomal response ending in the phosphorylation of H3 (Ser10)
and the activation of IEGs (37, 38). EGF and TPA were first reported
to induce H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 (38, 39) and Ser28 (40),
respectively, through the ERK pathway. Recently, we also found
that the p53 tumor suppressor protein is required for RSK2mediated histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 induced by EGF or
UVB stimulation (13). Moreover, we showed that knockdown of
histone H3 with siRNA inhibited EGF-induced cell transformation
in JB6 Cl41 cells (32). Notably, we found that overexpression of
mutant histone H3 (histone H3 S10A) in JB6 Cl41 cells inhibited

www.aacrjournals.org

EGF-induced cell transformation compared with cells overexpressing wild-type histone H3 (32).
Herein, our data indicated that RSK2 inhibition by gene knockout
suppressed cell proliferation (Fig. 2B) and overexpression of RSK2
induced cell proliferation as well as cell transformation (Fig. 3B and C)
through a Ras-dependent pathway (Fig. 4C). In contrast to overexpression, knockdown of RSK2 with siRNA inhibited Ras-induced
foci formation in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, kaempferol, a
chemical inhibitor of RSK2 (Fig. 5A), suppressed EGF-induced
transformation (Fig. 5D) as well as proliferation in JB6 Cl41 cells
(Fig. 5C). Very importantly, kaempferol also suppressed EGF-induced
histone H3 phosphorylation (Ser10; Fig. 6A). In addition, EGF-induced
phosphorylation of histone H3 was totally blocked in RSK2-null MEFs
(Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results indicate that RSK2 is a critical
regulator of cell transformation induced by tumor promoters, such as
EGF or TPA, and the effect is mediated through the phosphorylation of
histone H3 at Ser10 by RSK2.
Although the mechanism of RSK activation has been studied in
many research models, more progress is needed to understand the
biological roles of RSK2. Although several downstream substrates of
RSK2, including c-Fos, Elk-1, histones, CREB, ATF4, and p53, have
been identified (7–13), very little is known about the physiologic
function of RSK2 and especially its role in cell transformation.
Previously, we found that RSK2 overexpression in 293 cells induced
S-phase accumulation, indicating that RSK2 is also involved in the
G1-S transition (13). Moreover, dominant-negative CREB, which is a
downstream target of RSK2, induced G1 accumulation and then
stimulated apoptosis by attenuating DNA synthesis in response to
several activation signals, such as TPA, ionomycin, or concanavalin A
(41). In addition, the well-known downstream targets of RSK2 are
c-Fos, CREB, and histone H3. These proteins are involved in cell
proliferation as well as cell transformation (20, 32, 42). Our results
showed that knockdown of RSK2 by siRNA-RSK2 almost totally
suppressed focus formation in NIH3T3 cells and cell proliferation
was suppressed but to a lesser degree (Fig. 4C and D). Furthermore,
JB6 Cl41 cell transformation was inhibited more markedly by the
RSK2 inhibitor kaempferol than was cell proliferation in the same
cells (Fig. 5C and D). Kaempferol was shown to specifically inhibit
RSK2 but not RSK1 or RSK3. Previous docking studies using
computer modeling indicated that kaempferol can potentially form
hydrogen bonds with Thr210 in the RSK2 NH2-terminal ATP-binding
pocket (43). In addition, RSK2, which is phosphorylated and
activated by ERK, also phosphorylates histone H3 Ser10 (7, 8, 44,
45). We found that kaempferol did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 6A), indicating that ERKs, MEKs, Ras/Raf, and EGFR are not
targets. Overall, these results indicated that inhibition of cell
transformation mediated by suppressing RSK2 might be due to a
suppression of cell proliferation as well as a reduction of signaling to
downstream target transcription factors. RSK2 is thus a key
regulator of cell transformation induced by tumor promoters such
as EGF or TPA.
