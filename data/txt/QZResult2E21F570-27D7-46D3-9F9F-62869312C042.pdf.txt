Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The complexity of cancer has led to recent interest in polypharmacological approaches for
developing kinase-inhibitor drugs; however, optimal kinase-inhibition profiles remain difficult to
predict. Using a Ret-kinase-driven Drosophila model of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and
kinome-wide drug profiling, here we identify that AD57 rescues oncogenic Ret-induced lethality,
whereas related Ret inhibitors imparted reduced efficacy and enhanced toxicity. Drosophila
genetics and compound profiling defined three pathways accounting for the mechanistic basis of
efficacy and dose-limiting toxicity. Inhibition of Ret plus Raf, Src and S6K was required for
optimal animal survival, whereas inhibition of the ‘anti-target’ Tor led to toxicity owing to release
of negative feedback. Rational synthetic tailoring to eliminate Tor binding afforded AD80 and
AD81, compounds featuring balanced pathway inhibition, improved efficacy and low toxicity in
Drosophila and mammalian multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 models. Combining kinasefocused chemistry, kinome-wide profiling and Drosophila genetics provides a powerful systems
pharmacology approach towards developing compounds with a maximal therapeutic index.

The cellular kinase-signalling network is a major regulator of cancer progression. Kinasesignalling pathways are often involved in pathogenesis, and kinase mutations are common
and potent drivers of oncogenesis1–4. Targeting a single kinase has proven successful in
some cases; examples include drugs that inhibit BCR–ABL, as well as members of the
EGFR and RAF class of proteins5–7. However, results of this approach have been
mixed8–10. Difficulties include rapidly emerging resistance as well as considerable toxicity
that can limit dosing to levels that are insufficient for blocking tumour growth.
By contrast, most drugs approved for clinical use have multiple targets11–13. For many, or
perhaps most, ‘off-target’ activities contribute to the overall efficacy of a drug. Sorafenib
provides a recent example14: it was developed initially as an inhibitor of RAF kinase, but its

efficacy in renal and hepatocellular cancer was later attributed to inhibition of VEGFR2 and
PDGFR and potentially other targets15. Sorafenib highlights the therapeutic potential of
targeting multiple kinases but also the uncertainty and serendipity of phenotype-based
screening.
Most multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) patients have an autosomal-dominant
activating germline mutation in the RET (rearranged during transfection) receptor tyrosine
kinase that is necessary and probably sufficient to direct a series of transformation events
including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)16,17. To identify candidate compounds with
optimal polypharmacological profiles, we synthesized a panel of inhibitors with potency
against RET (a traditional target-based approach) that additionally target distinct
downstream kinases. We demonstrate how stepwise testing in Drosophila models of the
disease subtype MEN2B18 uncovered a spectrum of targets contributing to drug-induced
efficacy and toxicity. Our results present a new approach to rational drug development that
combines aspects of target- and phenotype-based drug discovery; it relies on whole-animal
screening to both explore the mechanism of a drug and identify an optimal
polypharmacological profile for suppressing tumours in vivo.

Identifying AD57 in a whole-animal Drosophila screen
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We previously reported a Drosophila MEN2B model in which an activating intracellular
mutated isoform of the Drosophila Ret orthologue (dRet) was targeted to the eye18. This
dRetMEN2B model proved useful for validating whole-animal efficacy of the kinase inhibitor
vandetanib (also known as ZD6474, Caprelsa)19, a drug recently approved for sporadic
MTC and for MTC arising in patients with MEN2 (ref. 20). To improve its utility for drug
screening, we developed a quantitative viability assay that uses the GAL4/upstream
activating system (UAS) to target oncogenic dRetMEN2B to multiple developing epithelial
tissues (Fig. 1a; T.K.D. et al., in preparation). Specifically, oncogene expression is driven by
the patched (ptc) promoter, which directs expression in a dynamic pattern including
developing epithelia (for example, wing, eye and leg) and other tissues21. We calibrated the
ptc>dRetMEN2B assay to permit 50% survival to pupariation and 0% survival to adulthood.
Oral administration of clinical kinase inhibitors22,23 resulted in weak (vandetanib), mild
(sunitinib) or stronger (sorafenib) rescue (Fig. 1b), validating our assay. Notably, sorafenib
rescued some animals to adulthood but did not considerably increase the proportion that
developed to pupariation, indicating some efficacy but also toxicity (reduced survival) at
optimal doses.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We developed and screened a library of polypharmacological compounds that target Ret in
addition to other classes of kinases24 (Supplementary fig. 1). One compound, AD57,
potently suppressed ptc > dRetMEN2B lethality in the larva, rescuing approximately 25% of
animals to adulthood (Fig. 1b, c). Rescued adults also showed complete suppression of
notum and scutellum defects that were observed in un-eclosed control pupae (Fig. 1c), and
were fully active and fertile. AD57 demonstrated both an improved efficacy and toxicity
profile in our assay compared with other kinase inhibitors (Fig. 1b).

AD57 exhibited improved activity compared to analogues
The overall structure of AD57-like compounds includes two fragments fused through a urea
linker (Fig. 1d). Shared features include a pyrazolopyrimidine core that functions as a mimic
of adenosine or hinge-binder and a hydrophobic element that binds within an allosteric
pocket of the kinase domain (Supplementary Fig. 1b). AD36, a close analogue of AD57,
contains a methylene group between the pyrazolopyrimidine ring and fused phenyl portion,
whereas the analogue AD58 does not contain the trifluoromethyl group (Fig. 1d). These
subtle structural changes led to substantial changes in biological activity; AD36 showed

some efficacy (increased numbers of pupae but no adults), whereas AD58 induced
considerable toxicity without detectable efficacy (fewer pupae and adults; Fig. 1b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These results demonstrate the sensitivity of whole-body phenotyping in Drosophila to detect
the effects of conservative structural differences between drug candidates. The difference
between AD36 and AD57 was particularly notable because both demonstrate similar
potency for Ret in vitro (Fig. 1d); indeed, our analysis of other kinase inhibitors indicated
that efficacy did not correlate solely with inhibition of Ret (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig.
2; data not shown). This suggested that targeting of additional kinases is necessary for the
biological efficacy of AD57.

AD57 suppressed dRetMEN2 transformation
We previously developed a wing-based assay for transformation and cell migration in which
the ptc-Gal4 driver directed oncogene expression in a stripe along the anterior–posterior
axis25. Adapting it to ptc > dRetMEN2B wings led to overproliferation, basal constriction and
cell migration away from the ptc domain (Fig. 2a; T.K.D. et al, in preparation). Oral
administration of AD57 blocked each of these phenotypes (Fig. 2a). Sorafenib, sunitinib and
vandetanib showed substantially weaker rescue (Fig. 1b; data not shown). We conclude that
oral administration of AD57 is particularly effective at suppressing dRet-mediated
transformation at doses that are non-toxic to the fly.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In standard mammalian RETMEN2 models, AD57 potently inhibited the viability of MEN2B
(MZ-CRC-1) and MEN2A (TT) patient-derived cell lines with a half-maximum inhibitory
concentration (IC50) that was several orders more potent than sorafenib, vandetanib, AD36
or AD58 (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). In a conventional mouse xenograft model, AD57
significantly suppressed TT-based tumour growth at a dose (20 mg kg−1) that demonstrated
no detectable toxicity as assessed by animal weights (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Together,
our data indicate that Drosophila in vivo assays provide a useful tool for identifying
compounds with improved in situ efficacy and toxicity profiles.

Erk and Src inhibition suppressed dRet signalling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our previous Drosophila genetic screens emphasized three major pathways for dRetMEN2Bmediated transformation: Ras/Raf, Src and glucose metabolism/PI3K18 (Fig. 2b; data not
shown). Furthermore, assessing AD57, AD36 and AD58 in a broad in vitro mammaliankinase panel indicated that small perturbations in the structure of AD57 led to considerable
changes in kinase selectivity (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Tables 1–3). For example, AD57 is
a potent inhibitor of the pathway-relevant human kinases BRAF, S6K (also known as
RPS6KB1),mTORand SRC (Fig. 2c). By comparison, AD58 is a much weaker inhibitor of
S6K and BRAF but is more potent against mTOR; AD36 is nearly inactive against mTOR,
S6K and SRC, potentially reflecting steric clash at the gatekeeper position (compare, for
example, ABL(T315I), EGFR(T790M) and RET(V804L); Supplementary Fig. 4). We
focused on effectors of RAS, PI3K and SRC, although other targeted pathways may also
contribute to compound activity.
We demonstrated previously that activation of Src is sufficient to direct many of the aspects
we observed within the ptc > dRetMEN2B domain25–27 and we explored its activity in situ.
Expressing ptc > dRetMEN2B led to high levels of activated phospho-Src at the basal
invading front of transformed cells (Fig. 2a). In addition to suppressing invasion, oral
administration of AD57 suppressed phospho-Src in basal regions of the wing epithelium
(Fig. 2a). Distinctions with AD36 and AD58 were instructive. AD36 failed to suppress the
invasion or basal migration of ptc > dRetMEN2B cells and, as predicted by our in vitro assay,
phospho-Src remained at high levels at the basal leading edge (Fig. 2a). Also as predicted,

AD58 suppressed basal phospho-Src accumulation, yet it failed to prevent invasion and
basal migration (Fig. 2a). These data support the view that Src inhibition contributes to
reducing invasion and basal migration, but suggest that other targets are also required.
Elevated Ras/Erk pathway activity leads to ectopic veins in the adult wing (for example, refs
28, 29). Expression of oncogenic dRet throughout the developing wing (765 > dRetMEN2B)
led to disruption of the overall adult wing pattern, including ectopic wing veins. Reducing
gene dosage of the erk orthologue rolled suppressed these phenotypes, confirming that wing
vein formation is dependent on Ras/Erk activity (Fig. 2d). dRetMEN2B-dependent wing
phenotypes were suppressed by AD57 (Fig. 2d); by contrast, vandetanib had little effect
(Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Notably, the ectopic wing vein phenotype was slightly but
consistently enhanced with AD58 treatment (Fig. 2d). This enhancement was suppressed by
removing a functional copy of erk (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5c), further indicating
that AD58 treatment actually increased Ras pathway signalling. These data raise the
possibility that AD58 toxicity was due to excess Ras pathway activity and that further
suppressing Ras pathway activity would improve the overall efficacy of AD57.

Unbalanced dTor inhibition promotes toxicity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AD58 directed substantial whole-animal toxicity when fed to ptc > dRetMEN2B or wild-type
flies (Figs 1a, 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 6), providing us with an opportunity to explore
aspects of AD drug-class toxicity. On the basis of in vitro kinase data, AD58 is a stronger
inhibitor of mTOR and a weaker inhibitor of RAF than AD57 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary
Fig. 4c). Recently, mTOR has been demonstrated to provide feedback inhibition of the RAS
pathway in mammals30,31. We therefore assessed whether the high toxicity observed for
AD58 was due in part to high inhibition of Drosophila target of rapamycin (dTor) coupled
with low inhibition of Raf, leading to hyperactivation of Drosophila Ras85D pathway
signalling throughout the animal.
Reducing dTor (ptc > dRetMEN2B, dTor−/+) dominantly suppressed the efficacy of AD57
and enhanced the toxicity of AD58 (Fig. 3a). Quantitative phenotypic assessment indicated
that AD58-induced toxicity was due primarily to an increase in proliferation (Fig. 3c, e).
Also, reducing the gene dosage of dTor enhanced the AD58-induced ectopic wing vein
formation (Fig. 3d) and suppressed efficacy of AD57 on wing vein patterning
(Supplementary Fig. 5b), indicating that reducing dTor increased Erk activity. Notably,
removing a genomic copy of the dTor target S6K suppressed AD58 toxicity (Fig. 3a),
indicating that S6K is independent of the dTor feedback loop.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also assessed whether reducing the activity of Drosophila Ras85D pathway components
could abrogate the effects of dTor inhibition. AD58-mediated toxicity in wild-type flies was
almost completely suppressed by co-feeding with the Raf inhibitor sorafenib or Mek
inhibitor AZD6244 (Fig. 3b). Combining AD58 with sorafenib also resulted in considerable
suppression of invasion and migration within ptc > dRetMEN2B wing discs (Fig. 3f).
Removing a genomic copy of erk/rolled considerably improved AD57 rescue (Fig. 3a).
Together, these data indicate that both AD57 and AD58 act to inhibit dTor activity, but that
failure of AD58 to suppress Raf kinase led to elevated Ras pathway activity. Elevated Erk,
in turn, led to poor efficacy against the tumour and high whole-body toxicity (see Fig. 5 for
pathway logic).

AD80 and AD81 demonstrated an improved profile
Together, our genetic and chemical data indicate that an optimal drug for MEN2B would
show activity against Ret, Src, S6K and Raf but limited activity against Tor. To test this
logic and potentially improve AD57, we developed a series of new AD-based analogues.

From our previously determined structure of AD57 in complex with c-Src we reasoned that
modifying the terminal phenyl group of AD57 would selectively perturb dTor binding
without altering inhibitory interactions with dRet, Raf, S6K or Src. We therefore generated
two compounds, AD80 andAD81, into which ortho-fluorine and para-chlorine groups were
respectively incorporated (Fig. 4a).
On the basis of their in vitro human kinase profiles, AD80 and AD81 inhibited RET, RAF,
SRC and S6K, with greatly reduced mTOR activity relative to AD57 and AD58 (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 7). Oral administration of either AD80 or AD81 resulted in a notable
70–90% of animals developing to adulthood in our Drosophila ptc > dRetMEN2B model, a
considerable improvement over the efficacy observed with AD57 and all other compounds
we have tested until now (Fig. 4b). Focusing on AD80, ectopic Src activation (Fig. 4c) and
wing vein pattern phenotypes (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 6b) were strongly suppressed,
indicating that Src and Ras activities were restored to normal levels. The result was
phenotypically normal ptc > dRetMEN2B adults, showing rescue that exceeded AD57 or
sorafenib, which yielded adults with some cuticle defects. Notably, although reducing erk
gene dosage (ptc > dRetMEN2B, erk−/+) in the fly considerably enhanced the efficacy of
AD57 and AD58 in viability assays, it did not alter efficacy of AD80 treatment (Fig. 4d).
This indicates that AD80 is optimal for Ras–Erk pathway inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The improved profile of AD80 also translated to mammalian MEN2 models. AD80 inhibited
proliferation of MZ-CRC-1 and TT thyroid cancer cells in culture, probably through the
induction of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 8). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated potent
downregulation of phosphorylated Ret and several downstream biomarkers within these
cells (Supplementary Fig. 9).AD80 also promoted enhanced tumour growth inhibition and
reduced body-weight modulation relative to vandetanib in a mouse xenograft model (Fig. 4f,
g and Supplementary Table 4).

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here we describe a systems pharmacology approach for cancer drug discovery that focuses
on whole-animal testing, chemistry and genetics to identify a single agent with an optimized
polypharmacological profile. Using a stepwise approach that combined genetics and
chemistry, we identified AD80 and AD81 as polypharmacological agents with an optimal
balance of activity against Ret, Raf, Src, Tor and S6K that show high efficacy with very low
toxicity (Fig. 5). Our studies indicate that these drugs may be an improvement over existing
compounds including vandetanib, a kinase inhibitor demonstrated by our group and others to
act on Ret-based tumorigenesis19,32 that has recently been approved for MTC patients.
Details of human tumours can differ substantially from Drosophila cancer models and
mouse xenografts, and the true predictive value of this approach must await further testing.
A related approach is to assess drug combinations; however, in addition to the increased cost
of clinically testing a mix of compounds, complex target-profile interactions and differing
pharmacokinetics can make executing clinical trials challenging.
The connection between the Tor and Ras pathways within the MEN2B model is reminiscent
of a general network motif termed an incoherent feed-forward loop33: here, dRetMEN2B
activates Ras but also represses Ras signalling by activating dTor. This network motif has
been identified within diverse contexts, including transcriptional and neuronal networks, as a
means to tune cellular responses to incoming signals33. Perhaps this motif will prove
common within cancer signalling networks, providing a useful place to search for other antitargets that limit the therapeutic benefits of kinase inhibitors.

METHODS
Inhibitor studies in flies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AZD6244 (Cal Biochem), sorafenib, sunitinib (LC Labs) and new AD-series drugs were
dissolved in DMSO buffer and then diluted in molten (~50 °C)-enriched fly food and left to
solidify at room temperature (25 °C) to yield the indicated final drug concentrations. 30–60
embryos of each genotype were raised on drug-containing food (500–1,000 µl) in 5-ml vials
until they matured as third-instar larvae (wing disc migration and invasion assay) or allowed
to proceed to adulthood (viability assay and wing vein quantification assay). Experiments
were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times.
Fly stocks, genetics and subcloning
Fly stocks were obtained from Bloomington stock centres and C. Pfleger (rolled1). UASdRetMEN2B flies were generated by ligating a partial EcoR1-digested glass multimerized
repeat–dRetMEN2B DNA fragment18 into EcoR1 site of pUAST vector. Transgenic flies
were generated by standard protocol.
Histology and antibodies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For wing disc invasion and migration analysis third-instar discs were staged and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence was performed as described34. Antibodies used
were anti-phospho-Src(Y418) (Invitrogen). AlexaFluor secondary antibodies were used for
all immunofluorescence experiments. Confocal imaging used a Leica DM5500 Q
microscope and image analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop.
MTT assays using cancer lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MZ-CRC-1 (MEN2B) and TT (MEN2A) cell lines were cultured in DMEM buffer and
Ham’s F12K media, respectively, supplemented with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
a penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics mix. Cells were grown in 75 cm2 sterile polystyrene
culture flasks to 80% confluency, trypsinized and re-seeded in equal aliquots into 96-well
plates. After 2 days and ~50% confluency, media was removed and replaced with DMSO or
drug-containing media. Cells were allowed to grow for another 6 days, after which the
thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed. Cell media was removed
and replaced with MTT-containing media (1 mg ml−1 final concentration) and cells were
allowed to grow at 37 °C for another 3.5 h. MTT media was removed and MTT precipitate
dissolved in 4 mM HCl, 0.1% NP40 in isopropanol, solvent by shaking for 1 h.
Spectrophotometric readings at 590 nm and 630 nm using a 96-well-plate reader were used
to establish growth and viability of cells. Each drug dose was tested in quadruplicates and
experiments repeated twice.
Western blotting of fly wing disc tissues
A total of ten third-instar discs of each treatment were dissolved in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease-inhibitor
cocktail and phosphatase-inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Total protein in each sample was
quantified using BIORAD protein assay. Samples were boiled, resolved on SDS–PAGE and
transferred by standard protocols. Membranes were stripped with SIGMA Restore stripping
buffer and re-probed with other antibodies to assess the signal under exactly the same
loading conditions. Antibodies used were from Cell Signaling Technology. Only phosphoSrc antibody was from Invitrogen.

Whole-mount imaging of fly notum and wings

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For fly notum images, after completion of the viability assay, un-eclosed pupae were
dissected out of their pupal cases, placed on double-sided tape and imaged under the Leica
MZ16F stereomicroscope. Eclosed adults were imaged similarly. For adult wing vein
analysis, wings from male flies were dissected and kept in 100% ethanol overnight, mounted
on slides in 80% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline solution and imaged by regular light
microscopy using a Leica DM5500 Q microscope.
Xenograft analysis
5×106 TT cells were injected subcutaneously into one flank of male nu nu mice. Mice
showing established growing tumours were separated into vehicle or drug-treatment groups.
A similar range of tumour sizes was selected for each experiment (vehicle versus AD57;
vehicle versus AD80 versus vandetanib). Vehicle, AD57 (20 mg kg−1), AD80 (30 mg kg−1)
or vandetanib (50 mg kg−1) were administered by oral gavage (per os) once daily, five times
a week. Tumour and body-weight measurements were performed three times per week.
Mouse experiments were carried out by Washington Biotechnology (accreditation no.
A192-01) according to the Public Health Services guideline, set forth by the Office for
Laboratory and Animal Welfare division of the National Institutes of Health.
Western blotting of cancer cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MZ-CRC-1 (MEN2B) and TT (MEN2A) cell lines were grown in 24-well plates in DMEM
buffer (+ 4.5 g l−1 glucose; without L-Glu and pyruvate) and Ham’s F12K (ATCC) media
respectively; each supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin and
streptomycin antibiotics. Cells were treated for 1 h with inhibitors or vehicle (0.1% DMSO).
After treatment, media was removed and cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then
lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (25mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
NP-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Cell lysates
were separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted for the indicated
proteins using commercial antibodies (all were from Cell Signaling Technology). For
measuring cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and cleaved caspase 3, cells were
treated identically with the following exceptions: cells were incubated with inhibitors for 72
h, causing a number of cells to become non-adherent. Both adherent and non-adherent cells
were combined before cell lysis and immunoblot analysis.
IC50 value measurements

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)–RET kinase domain fusion (Invitrogen) was
diluted in a mix containing phosphor-acceptor peptide (132 µM final concentration;
sequence: EAIYAAPFKKK), buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES 7.2, 40 ng BSA) and
varying concentrations of inhibitor. Reactions were initiated by addition of 100 µM cold
ATP supplemented with 5 µCi γ32P-ATP. After 15 min at room temperature, 2 µl of the
reactions (out of 25 µl total volume) were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper
(Whatman). Blots were washed at least 5 times over 1 h in 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid and
blots were then dried and transferred radioactive counts were measured by phosphorimaging
using a Typhoon Scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Quantification was conducted with
ImageQuant software and titration data were fit to a sigmoidal dose response to derive IC50
values in the Prism software package. Inhibitors were diluted threefold over a final
concentration range of 0.0005–100 µM to derive dose–response curves. Experiments were
completed three times to derive mean and standard error measurements. IC50 values for
KDR, SRC, ABL, C-RAF, mTOR, EGFR and AKT1 were determined similarly with the
following exceptions. Dephosphorylated casein was used as a substrate for mTOR
(Invitrogen). Inactive MEK1 (Millipore) was used as a substrate for C-RAF (Millipore).

Poly Glu-Tyr was used as the substrate for KDR (Invitrogen), EGFR (Invitrogen), SRC
(purified as previously described24) and ABL (purified as previously described24). Myelin
basic protein was used as a substrate for AKT1 (Invitrogen).
Kinase-inhibitor profiling
AD36, AD57, AD58, AD80 and AD81 were assayed by Invitrogen to derive percentage
inhibition of kinase activity. All compounds were screened at 1 µM and values are shown in
Supplementary Tables 1–3. Detailed procedures for kinase reactions, ATP concentrations
used and Z’-LYTE or Adapta assay formats are described in the SelectScreen Customer
Protocol (http://www.invitrogen.com/kinaseprofiling). Kinase-inhibition data for 1 µM
inhibitor of each of the clinical and tool compounds staurosporine, sunitinib, dasatinib,
pyrazolopyrimidine 2, gefitinib, imatinib, SB202190, erlotinib and BIRB796 were obtained
from Invitrogen (http://tools.invitrogen.com/content/sfs/brochures/
Activity_Assay_Kinase_Selectivity_Data.pdf). Clustering and visualization were performed
with Cluster 3.0 and Java TreeView (http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/

Figure 1. Screening for an optimal therapeutic index in a Drosophila MEN2B model yields a
polypharmacological kinase inhibitor

a, Suppression of dRetMEN2B-induced developmental block and whole-animal toxicity were
scored based on the number of embryos (n) that survived as pupae (x) and adults (y). b, Per
cent viability of control- or drug-treated flies determined for pupae (x per n) and adults (y
per n). AD57 emerged as the best single-agent hit from the screen. Asterisks indicate
significance comparing to control using Student’s t-test (P < 0.05 for adults in AD57 and
sorafenib treatments, and P < 0.05 for pupae for the rest). Error bars denote s.e.m. Total n of

bristles (asterisks) and scutellum defects (brackets); controls (+ dimethylsulphoxide
(DMSO)) died as un-eclosed adults. AD57 strongly suppressed whereas sorafenib (SF)
weakly suppressed these defects, yielding fully eclosed adults. Width of each wild-type
notum is ~0.75 mm. WT, wild type. d, Structure–activity relationships suggest that dRet
inhibition alone is insufficient to rescue MEN2B flies. IC50 values were determined against

Figure 2. Multiple-pathway inhibition by AD57 mitigates dRet-directed phenotypes

a, z-series confocal images of larval wing epithelia; virtual cross-section through tissue with
apical up. Control tissue shows apical phospho-Src (pSrc) expression (red) in the junctions.
ptc > dRetMEN2B wing cells (green fluorescent protein; GFP+) shifted basally (arrows) and
invaded below adjacent wild-type tissue; phospho-Src emerged at the basal invading front
(asterisks). These phenotypes were strongly suppressed by AD57 but not by AD36, AD58 or
vandetanib (VD). Apical–basal distance is ~45 µm; imaged with ×63 oil. b, Partial list of
signalling pathways activated by oncogenic dRetMEN2B. MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases.

Figure 3. Feedback downregulation of the Ras pathway through the anti-target Tor

a, Reducing dTor gene dosage decreased per cent viability of AD57- nd AD58-treated
dRetMEN2B flies (P < 0.05 comparing pupae (AD57, AD58) or adults (AD57)). Conversely,
reducing erk gene dosage enhanced survival of both (P < 0.05 comparing pupae (AD58) or
adults (AD57)). Treatment with a specific MEK inhibitor alone, AZD6244, in control (ptc >
dRetMEN2B) or erk−/+ flies did not rescue viability compared to AD57-treated flies,
suggesting its level of Ras pathway suppression is close to optimal (P>0.05 comparing
AZD6244 pupae). Reducing S6K (S6k−/+) partially mitigated toxicity from AD58 treatment.

Decreased viability of wild-type flies by AD58 was mitigated by co-administration of
sorafenib or AZD6244. Total n of 118, 47, 51 and 28 from left to right. c, Reducing dTor
strongly enhanced AD58-mediated invasion (asterisks, arrow) and excess proliferation. Top
panel, a lateral reconstruction; compare with Fig. 2a. Bottom panels represent an apical
view, constructed as a z-series overlay of confocal images spanning the full depth of the
wing disc epithelia. It shows how cells migrate from the ptc domain to distant sites (for
example, arrow, asterisks), a phenotype strongly enhanced in the presence of dTor−/+ plus
AD58. Top panel (GFP+) width is ~150 µm; imaged with ×63. Bottom right panel width
(GFP+) is ~150 µm; both bottom panels were imaged with ×40. d, Wing defects in ptc >
dRetMEN2B dTor−/+ adults were further enhanced by AD58. e, Quantification of ptc >
dRetMEN2B phenotypes. Invasion was established by scoring for single or groups of GFPlabelled cells that relocated away from the ptc boundary (Fig. 3c, asterisks). Basal migration
was scored as indentation of the apical surface (see Fig. 2a, arrows). Proliferation was
scored as significant widening of the ptc boundary. The number of wings analysed under
each condition is indicated in brackets. Reduced dTor increased proliferation in the presence
of AD58 as well as reducing survival; all aspects were improved by feeding AD57 whereas
increased invasion by feeding AD36 did not translate to reduced survival. f, Migration of
dRetMEN2B-transformed cells was blocked by co-treatment with AD58 plus sorafenib
(bottom). Treatment with similar doses of AD58 (top) or sorafenib alone (not shown) did not
suppress migration. Arrow indicates constriction of apical cell surface and asterisk indicates
basal invading front. Apical–basal distance is ~45 µm; imaged with ×63.

Figure 5. Differential polypharmacology and outcomes from the AD compounds

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Models to explain the AD series of compounds in dRetMEN2B transgenic flies. Pathway
components blocked by inhibitors have been boxed, with resulting flux indicated by orange
lines and arrows, and the incoherent feed-forward (i.f.f.) loop highlighted in blue. Grey
dashed lines indicate loss of dTor inhibition. Targets in black boxes contribute to efficacy
whereas inhibition of the anti-target dTor (red) leads to hyperactivation of the Ras pathway,
causing high toxicity in the MEN2 model. The polypharmacological profile of AD80 best
addresses the three key pathways, providing high drug efficacy and optimal therapeutic
index.
