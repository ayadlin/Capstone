Abstract
Cancer stem-like cells (CSC) have been widely studied, but their clinical relevance has yet to be established in
breast cancer. Here, we report the establishment of primary breast tumor–derived xenografts (PDX) that
encompass the main diversity of human breast cancer and retain the major clinicopathologic features of primary
tumors. Successful engraftment was correlated with the presence of ALDH1-positive CSCs, which predicted
prognosis in patients. The xenografts we developed showed a hierarchical cell organization of breast cancer with
the ALDH1-positive CSCs constituting the tumorigenic cell population. Analysis of gene expression from
functionally validated CSCs yielded a breast CSC signature and identiﬁed a core transcriptional program of
19 genes shared with murine embryonic, hematopoietic, and neural stem cells. This generalized stem cell program
allowed the identiﬁcation of potential CSC regulators, which were related mainly to metabolic processes. Using an
siRNA genetic screen designed to target the 19 genes, we validated the functional role of this stem cell program in
the regulation of breast CSC biology. Our work offers a proof of the functional importance of CSCs in breast cancer,
and it establishes the reliability of PDXs for use in developing personalized CSC therapies for patients with breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 73(24); 7290–300. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Heterogeneity is a limitation to cure breast cancer, overcome recurrences and metastases (1). A major cause of heterogeneity is the hierarchical cellular organization: that
endows a small, phenotypically distinct population of cancer
stem cells (CSC) with the capacity to support tumor growth,
metastasis and therapeutic resistance (2–11). Multiple pools of
stem cells have been identiﬁed within a tumor by different
means, including (12–14) mouse lineage tracing experiments
(15–17). To measure the capacity of a subset of tumor cells to
transfer a cancer, tumorigenesis assays with iso- or xenogenic

transplantation have been used for many years. They evaluate
both tumor-initiating and self-renewal capacities and are
widely used to assess CSC activity. They have shown that
leukemia and many solid tumors are organized along a hierarchical model (18–20). Orthotopic breast cancer xenografts
have been shown to keep the features of their corresponding
human tumors and to predict prognosis in patients (21). Yet,
the validity of xenotransplant assays for CSC studies has been
questioned. The use of highly immunodeﬁcient mice increases
the frequency of tumorigenic cells in certain types of cancers
such as melanoma (22, 23). Furthermore, this model tests the
potential of cells to form tumors, not their actual fate in the
tumor in which they are born, regardless of microenvironmental variables. Notwithstanding these issues, the CSC model
suggests that focusing attention and therapies on CSCs rather
than on non-CSCs may improve prognosis and help cure
cancer. However, both the clinical relevance and universality
of the CSC model remain to be ﬁrmly established in solid
tumors. An approach would be to show that features of CSCs,
but not of non-CSCs, inﬂuence clinical outcome. A recent study
has shown emerging evidence supports the idea that properties of leukemic stem cells (LSC) may be associated with
prognosis (24). Here, we report the establishment of a bank
of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from primary breast cancer (xenobank). We found that a xenograft retains the main
features of its cognate primary tumor and that successful

Clinical Relevance of Breast CSCs from PDXs

engraftment is correlated with the presence of CSCs in the
primary tumor and predicts prognosis in patients. We established the gene expression signatures (GES) of functionally
validated CSC populations (breast CSC-GES) and tested their
clinical relevance in patients with breast cancers. This functionally validated CSC population is correlated with survival
and expresses genes governing stem cell functions, supporting
a major prediction of the CSC model and opening further
promises for new anti-CSC therapies using valid preclinical
models.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
Samples of human origin and associated data were obtained
from the IPC/CRCM Tumour Bank that operates under authorization # AC-2007-33 granted by the French Ministry of
Research. Before scientiﬁc use of samples and data, patients
were appropriately informed and asked to consent in writing,
in compliance with French and European regulations. The
project was approved by the IPC Institutional Review Board.
Animal studies were approved by the INSERM ofﬁce for
Laboratory Animal Medicine.
Primary tumor samples
All tissue samples were collected prospectively at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes from January 2008 to June 2009. Samples
were obtained from fresh entire core biopsies or surgical
specimen. Tumoral cells content was evaluated under light
microscope: when it reached at least 70% of cells, the sample
was selected for study and for one part frozen in liquid nitrogen
and for another part directly processed for mice implantation.
All the histoclinical information of 74 different samples collected are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Patient's treatments followed the standard guidelines of our institute: 56
patients underwent anthracyclin-based chemotherapy, 59 irradiation, and 41 received hormone therapy.
Primary tumor processing and implantation
Human breast primary tumors obtained after surgery
were dissociated mechanically and enzymatically using collagenase/hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies) digestion
to generate single-cell suspension for the in vivo implantation. For each primary tumor dissociated, 1  106 cells were
implanted orthotopically in humanized cleared fat pads of
NSG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgnull) mice for establishing xenotransplants as previously described (Supplementary Information; ref. 19).
Flow cytometric analysis
The analysis was processed on single-cell suspension from
our PDXs obtained as described above. ALDEFLUOR kit
(StemCell Technologies) was used to isolate the population
with high ALDH enzymatic activity as previously described
(19). To eliminate cells of mouse origin from the PDXs, we used
staining with an anti-H2Kd antibody (BD Biosciences, 1:200, 20
minutes on ice) followed by staining with a secondary antibody
labeled with phycoerythrin (PE; Jackson Laboratories, 1:250, 20
minutes on ice).

Tumorigenicity assay
We evaluate the outgrowth potential of each population
(ALDEFLUOR-positive, ALDEFLUOR-negative, unselected)
sorted from three different PDXs (CRCM226 x, CRCM174 x,
CRCM168 x) and injected in cleared humanized fat pads of NSG
mice. We conducted serial passages in vivo, using limiting
dilutions of ALDEFLUOR-positive, -negative, and unselected
cells (50,000 cells; 5,000 cells; 3,000 cells; 500 cells; 300 cells). For
each PDX model and for each limiting dilutions, 10 fat pads
were injected. Each tumors generated with 500 sorted cells
were serially re-implanted three times and in 10 different fat
pads. Each mouse that present a tumor reaching a size of 10
mm was considered as a tumor-bearing mouse.
Immunohistochemistry
Expression of ALDH1, CD44/CD24, ER, ERBB2, Ki67, PR, and
p53 was studied by immunohistochemistry. The characteristics of the antibodies and experimental procedures are
described in the Supplementary Information.
DNA and RNA extraction
DNA and RNA were extracted from frozen primary tumor
samples, PDXs, and ALDEFLUOR-positive/-negative cells by
using the All prep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen) for
primary tumors and PDXs and the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen)
for ALDEFLUOR-sorted cells.
Gene expression analysis
Gene expression proﬁling was done with Affymetrix U133
Plus 2.0 human oligonucleotide microarrays. Preparation of
cRNA, hybridizations, washes, and detection were done as
previously described (25). See Supplementary Information for
further detailed description of gene expression array and
bioinformatics analysis.
Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH)
was applied to 75 samples (53 primary tumors and 22 PDXs,
including 19 early passages and 3 late passages) using highresolution 244 K CGH microarrays (Hu-244A, Agilent Technologies). See Supplementary Information for further detailed
description of gene expression array and bioinformatics analysis.
siRNA screen and ALDEFLUOR analysis
We use the SUM159 mesenchymal breast cancer cell line
(BCL) and S68 luminal BCL to conduct the siRNA screen. The
cell lines were grown using the recommended culture conditions (26). We have adapted a methodology to optimize the
reverse transfection of SUM159 and S68 cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Five thousand cells were plated
in triplicate in 96-well plates with 0.25 pmol of siRNA in 25 mL of
Opti-MEM I Medium. The ALDEFLUOR-positive population
was evaluated in triplicate at 72 hours after lipofection. We
have validated that CSCs and nontumorigenic cells were
equally transfected (data not shown). We miniaturized the
ALDEFLUOR assay for CSC-enriched population detection per
cell in 96-well plate. For each well, we used 0.25 mL of substrate
(BAAA) and 100 mL of ALDEFLUOR buffer. We used an

automated ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; LSR2) to
detect the ALDEFLUOR-positive population in each well. Each
experiment was controlled in 6-plicate using cells incubated
with 0.5 mL of DEAB. The mini siRNA library of 19 genes was
designed by Qiagen based on a published library siRNA that
have been shown in peer-reviewed publication to provide
effective gene silencing. We used 3 siRNAs per selected gene,
most likely in triplicates and considered as a "hit" each siRNA
construct that induces a variation of the number of ALDEFLUOR-positive cells over a threshold of 2-fold the CSC proportion detected in the control (BCLs infected with a MOCK
siRNA). Cell viability was evaluated using 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) staining.
siRNA screen and sphere formation efﬁciency analysis
We have conducted the siRNA screen with both BCLs
following the reverse transfection protocol described before.
Then, 72 hours after lipofection, BCLs were dissociated and
plated as single cells in ultra-low attachment plates (Corning,
www.sigmaaldrich.com) at low density (1,000 viable cells per
milliliter). Cells were grown as previously described (27). After
5 days of suspension culture, the capacity of cells to form tumor
spheres was quantiﬁed.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses used the SPSS software (version 10.0.5)
and are described in Supplementary Information.

Results
Generation of PDXs
We transplanted 74 fresh primary breast tumors from 71
different individuals into cleared and humanized mammary fat
pads of female NSG mice. All implanted tumors were from
primary tumor and not from metastasis. The 74 primary tumors
implanted cover the main histoclinical features met in an
unselected set of breast tumors (Supplementary Table S1).
Twenty PDXs were established of the 74 primary samples
transplanted with an engraftment rate of 27%. We successfully
maintained 13 PDXs through serial passages (transplantable
rate: 17.5%); 7 werelostbetween theﬁrst andthefourthpassages.
The average delay of growth of PDXs was 212 days (range, 77–
466). PDX growth kinetic (time to reach 10 mm) was stable or
accelerated with serial passages (Supplementary Fig. S1).
PDXs maintain the histologic and phenotypic features of
primary tumors
We compared histology, Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR)
grade, and pathologic phenotype (based on ERBB2, ER, PR,
Ki67, p53 protein expression) of PDXs with those of the cognate
primary tumors. We observed a striking preservation of the
main histological (Fig. 1A and B) and immunohistochemical
features (Table 1). Among the 20 PDXs, only the expression of
hormonal receptors [estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)] was lost in 4 PDXs of 11 compared with
their corresponding primary tumors. ERBB2 overexpression or
"triple-negative" phenotype was maintained in all the PDXs. All
the primary tumors that successfully engraft presented a high
grade (SBR grade  2), which was retained in PDXs. Concern-

ing p53 status, only one discordant case (CRCM274) was
observed with a gain of p53 overexpression in the PDXs.
PDXs maintain the genome proﬁle and retain the
molecular subtype of cognate primary tumors
In 18 paired primary tumors/PDXs, we determined the
genomic proﬁles according to DNA copy number alterations
(CNA; Supplementary Fig. S2). We observed an almost perfect
preservation of the genomic proﬁles in paired PDXs with a
correlation score of 0.81 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, late passages in
mice (CRCM168 X P11, CRCM226 X P10, CRCM237 X P8)
preserved a genomic proﬁle identical to early passages (P0 to
P2; Fig. 1D). We proﬁled 19 paired primary tumors/PDXs using
Affymetrix whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays and
determined the molecular subtypes by using the PAM50 predictor. Primary tumors from the 5 major molecular subtypes
successfully engraft with 1 luminal A, 4 luminal B, 4 ERBB2-like,
8 basal, and 2 normal-like. In 14 pairs of 19, the molecular
subtype of the PDXs was identical to that of the corresponding
primary tumor (Fig. 1C). CRCM214 PT and CRCM274 PT were
respectively of luminal B and luminal A subtypes, but their
paired PDXs lost expression of ER or PR and switched to an
ERBB2 subtype, without modiﬁcation of ERBB2 expression.
CRCM184 X and CRCM272 X were respectively of ERBB2 and
luminal B subtype, whereas the parental primary tumors were of
normal-like subtype; this is likely to be due to the dilution of
ERBB2- or ER-overexpressing cancer cells by abundant stromal
and normal breast tissue in the human samples (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Thus, our model of xenografts generally phenocopied
the major molecular features of the corresponding primary
tumors and maintained these features among passages.
PDXs present a hierarchical organization driven by a
CSC population
To evaluate the presence of a CSC population in our PDXs,
we used the ALDEFLUOR assay. We detected an ALDEFLUORpositive population in all tested xenografts, ranging from 0.2%
to 12.3% (average 3.88%) of the total cancer cell population
(Supplementary Fig. S4). ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative
cells isolated from 3 different PDXs were transplanted in
limited dilutions in recipient mice. The percentage of
tumor-bearing mice decreased with the number of injected
ALDEFLUOR-negative cells from 77% with 50,000 ALDEFLUOR-negative cells to 0% with 300 ALDEFLUOR-negative
cells, whereas 100% of mice injected with ALDEFLUOR-positive cells developed tumors, even with 300 cells only (Fig. 2A).
The breast CSC frequency as determined by limiting dilution
analysis (LDA) in vivo was higher in the ALDEFLUOR-positive
cell population [1:1; conﬁdence interval (CI), 1–697] than in the
ALDEFLUOR-negative cell population (1:14,038; CI, 7,007–
28,126; P ¼ 2.13e18) or the unselected cell population
(1:1572; CI, 880–2,806; P ¼ 3.08e06; Supplementary Table
S2). Moreover, tumor growth rates were higher in tumors
generated from ALDEFLUOR-positive population than in
tumors generated from ALDEFLUOR-negative or unsorted
populations (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore,
only ALDEFLUOR-positive cells were able to regenerate both
ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative cells along passages,

showing that they are able to self-renew and differentiate (Fig.
2C). The tumorigenic potential of the ALDEFLUOR-negative
population was lost with passages, whereas it was maintained
in the ALDEFLUOR-positive population, suggesting that the
ALDEFLUOR-negative population contains cells that have
proliferation potential but lack self-renewal ability (Fig. 2D).
Thus, our PDXs retained a hierarchical organization with an
ALDEFLUOR-positive CSC population that initiates and maintains tumor growth.
Histologic grade and ALDH1-positive CSC content of
primary tumors predict engraftment
The clinical relevance of PDX models is suggested by the
good correlation between success in engraftment and survival
of patients (21). In our series, we thus ﬁrst questioned whether

engraftment was associated with clinical outcome. Only 4% of
primary tumors that failed to engraft versus 34% of primary
tumors that did developed metastasis within the ﬁrst 3 years of
follow-up (log-rank test, P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 2E). Moreover, among
the different histoclinical parameters associated with metastasis-free survival (MFS), only positive axillary lymph node (pN)
and primary tumor engraftment were independent factors
associated with MFS (Supplementary Fig. S6). This observation
conﬁrms that primary tumor engraftment is strongly correlated with disease evolution. However, the factors that inﬂuence tumor engraftment are not known. In our series, engraftment was not correlated with the type of sample (core biopsy or
surgical sample) used for primary injection (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Among the different histoclinical and molecular
factors tested (Supplementary Fig. S8), engraftment was

kinetics for all PDX models and all limited dilutions are represented in Supplementary Fig. S5. For each PDX model tested, the ALDEFLUORpositive population recreated the native cellular heterogeneity and gave rise to ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative cells, as shown in C for CRCM168
x (similar results were observed for CRCM226 x and CRCM174 x). The outgrowth potential of the ALDEFLUOR-positive population was maintained within
three serial passages, whereas it was lost at passage 2 for the ALDEFLUOR-negative population (D). Data represent mean  SD. E, successful

Figure 3. Identiﬁcation of a "common" stem cell core transcriptional program (CE-4SC) associated with clinical outcome. A, supervised analysis identiﬁed a
breast BCSC-GES. Gene expression proﬁles of ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative populations, isolated from 5 PDXs, were compared: 837 genes
were identiﬁed as differentially expressed between CSCs and non-CSCs and are represented on hierarchical clustering. B, to determine the pathways
associated with the BCSC-GES, we ran Ingenuity Pathway Analysis using Ingenuity software. Bar plot represents enrichment for each of the network
components identiﬁed, where the strength of the association is represented by the log (P). C, Kaplan–Meier MFS curves according to BCSC-GES

corresponding to the common 19 genes of 4 stemness GES. The overlap of the 4 GES is represented with a Venn diagram. The 19 common genes (named
CE-4SC) are listed.

15 of the 20 (75%) engrafters were ALDH1-positive (P ¼
7.2e5; Fig. 2I). In contrast, the presence of CD44þ/CD24
cells in primary tumors was not associated with engraftment
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Using multivariate analysis with Cox
proportional model, only SBR grade and ALDH1 expression
were independent factors associated with successful engraftment (Fig. 2J). These results conﬁrm the correlation between
patient's outcome, the capacity for a primary tumor to be
xenografted, and the presence of ALDH1-positive CSCs. They
further suggest that the molecular machinery governing CSC
properties is likely to inﬂuence clinical outcome.

tions from 8 different PDXs. Signiﬁcance Analysis of Microarrays analysis identiﬁed 837 genes as differentially expressed
[false discovery rate (FDR) ¼ 0.05]—hereafter designated as the
breast CSC gene expression signature (BCSC-GES)—between
the ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative populations (Fig. 3A,
Supplementary Table S3). To determine whether genes overexpressed in ALDEFLUOR-positive cells were commonly
enriched in known corresponding signaling pathways, we ran
a gene ontology analysis (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S4).
Among the different pathways identiﬁed, several play a role in
stem cell biology (BRCA1, p53, SHH, and retinoic pathways),
supporting the potential stem cell nature of our BCSC-GES.
The remaining pathways were associated with 2 main cell
functions (Supplementary Figs. S10 and S11): cell-cycle control
and especially the G1–S checkpoint controlling a crucial step
for cell fate decision (28) and DNA damage repair.

Clinical Relevance of Breast CSCs from PDXs

BCSC-GES is associated with poor prognosis in breast
cancer
We studied the correlation between the BCSC-GES and
histoclinical data using 13 clinically annotated gene expression
data sets corresponding to 2,609 patients (Supplementary
Table S5). On the basis of the BCSC-GES, the samples were
classiﬁed as "BCSC-like" (1,443 samples) or "non–BCSC-like"
(1,196 samples). Correlations were found between these two
classes and all histoclinical features except patient's age and
histological type: as compared with "non–BCSC-like" samples,
"BCSC-like" samples were more frequently SBR grade 3, with a
TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) phenotype and axillary
lymph node metastasis (Table S6). The prognostic value
regarding MFS was tested within the 1,642 patients with
available follow-up (8 of 13 datasets). The 5-year MFS rate
was 70% (95% CI, 67–74) in the "BCSC-like" group and 80% (95%
CI, 77–83) in the "non–BCSC-like" group (P ¼ 5.5e04, log-rank
test; Fig. 3C). In multivariate analysis, all these variables
remained signiﬁcant, including the BCSC-GES–based classiﬁcation (P ¼ 0.027; HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04–1.87; Fig. 3D), suggesting that our BCSC-GES determined in our PDXs was independently associated with prognosis in primary breast cancer.
Identiﬁcation of a "common" stem cell core
transcriptional program
To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern
stem cell intrinsic functions, we searched for common expression patterns between our 837-gene BCSC-GES and 3 stemness
GES deﬁned from embryonic, neural, and hematopoietic stem
cells (29). Enrichment test was signiﬁcant with each of the
tested stemness GES and the core stemness GES (3SC) deﬁned
by Ramalho-Santos and colleagues (Supplementary Table
SV7). In contrast, no enrichment was found between our
BCSC-GES and the 65-gene signature identiﬁed to be upregulated in differentiated cells. A total of 19 genes were common to
the 4 stem cell signatures (BCSC, ESC, HSC, NSC; Fig. 3E). These
leading genes were called the core-enriched 4SC genes (CE4SC). We then derived a metagene classiﬁer based on the
combined expression of these 19 genes and determined its
prognostic relevance in our public data set of 1,642 patients
with breast cancer. On the basis of the metagene, 2 classes of
patients were deﬁned and associated with different MFS
(Supplementary Fig. S12): the CE-4SC–positive class (733
patients) displayed a 67% 5-year MFS rate (95% CI, 64–71)
and the CE-4SC–negative class (909 patients) displayed an 81%
5-year MFS rate (95% CI, 78–83; P ¼ 4.8E- 06, log-rank test). In
multivariate analysis, the CE-4SC signature kept its independent prognostic value (Supplementary Fig. S12). Collectively,
these data indicate that our "common" stem cell transcriptional program inﬂuences patient outcome and represent a
short list of genes to identify key CSC regulators.
The "common" stem cell core transcriptional program
functionally regulates CSC self-renewal and
differentiation
Overall, the 19 CE-4SC genes are poorly characterized but
might be preferentially active in CSCs as compared with the
bulk of tumor cells and represent candidates for CSC targeting.

www.aacrjournals.org

Using the SUM159 mesenchymal BCL, we conducted a screening of an RNA interference library specially designed to block
the expression of these 19 genes. We used 3 independent siRNA
sequences per gene (57 siRNA constructs) and evaluated the
effect of single gene knockdown (KD) on the breast CSC
population using a miniaturized ALDEFLUOR assay in 96-well
plates. Among the 19 genes, the knockdown of 14 genes
signiﬁcantly modiﬁed the ratio CSC/non-CSC (Fig. 4A). Within
these 14 genes, 2 groups were identiﬁed. In the ﬁrst group of 5
genes (ACAT2, CBR3, DTYMK, NDUFAF1, PHTF2), the CSC
population decreased when gene expression was knocked
down. Conversely, in the second group of 10 genes (ACAT2,
FCF1, GFER, GCLM, KLHL7, MDFIC, MRPS10, MSH2, RAD23B,
UMPS), the CSC population signiﬁcantly increased. To validate
this observation, we tested the effect of the 57 siRNAs on tumor
sphere formation efﬁciency (SFE). SFE is an in vitro assay used
as a surrogate method to evaluate the proportion of CSCs. We
observed a strong correlation between modiﬁcation of the
ALDEFLUOR-positive/ALDEFLUOR-negative ratio and the
SFE after gene knockdown (r ¼ 0.826; CI, 0.72–0.89; P ¼
4.4e15; Fig. 4B). To conﬁrm these results, we screened our
siRNA library using the luminal BCL S68. We observed similar
results in the two BCLs analyzed (P ¼ 0.003), with 13 of 19 genes
with comparable effect after the gene knockdown on the
ALDEFLUOR-positive population (Supplementary Fig. S13).
We never observed an opposite effect of a speciﬁc gene
knockdown in the 2 BCLs and only 5 genes (EIF4EBP1, FCF1,
GCLM, KLHL7, SEC23IP) presented a restricted effect in one
BCL when gene expression was knocked down. The results on
the ALDEFLUOR-phenotype obtained in S68 were similarly
validated using SFE assay (r ¼ 0.79; CI, 0.61–0.87; P ¼ 6.3e10;
Supplementary Fig. S14). These results represent a ﬁrst validation of the functional role of our CE-4SC signature in the
regulation of breast CSC biology with genes that may be
implicated either in self-renewal program or in differentiation
process.

Discussion
We established a bank of serially transplantable, orthotopic
xenografts of primary breast cancers in humanized mouse fat
pad. The PDXs maintained the main histologic, phenotypical,
and molecular features of the cognate primary tumors as
shown before in other PDX models (21, 30). We show that the
xenografts maintain the same hierarchical organization as the
primary tumors, with CSCs able to self-renew and differentiate.
Our ﬁndings have 3 important implications for breast cancer
understanding and treatment.
First, our study contributes to the deﬁnition of CSCs. As
pointed out in the report of "The Year 2011 Working Conference on CSCs," despite the deep clinical implications of the CSC
model, CSC investigation has been hampered both by a lack of
consistency in the terms used for these cells and by how they
are deﬁned (31). Whereas the phenotypic deﬁnition (CD44þ/
CD24/low or ALDEFLUOR-positive cells for breast CSCs) can
restrain the population to a subset of CSCs, a functional
deﬁnition based on tumor-initiating or tumor-maintaining
properties seems more appropriate. Xenograft assays outlined

using the variation of the ALDEFLUOR-positive population as read out. Each siRNA construct that induced a variation in the number of ALDEFLUOR-positive
cells over a threshold of 2-fold the CSC proportion detected in the control was considered as a hit. Eighteen hits were identiﬁed, corresponding to 14 unique
genes, with green siRNA constructs that reduced signiﬁcantly the CSC population and red siRNA constructs that increased signiﬁcantly the CSC
population. B, comparison of CSC variation after gene knockdown by ALDEFLUOR phenotyping (right) and tumor SFE (left) using the 57 siRNAs. Results for

a population of cells in an operational rather than in a
conceptual context, based on tumor-initiating or tumor-maintaining properties, recapitulation of the entire tumoral heterogeneity. The paradigm of xenograft assay as a gold standard
to evaluate CSC activity has also been challenged as the ability
of a subpopulation of tumor cells to generate a tumor in the
mouse might reﬂect the permissivity of these cells for a speciﬁc
environment (22, 32). In that context, we questioned the
clinical relevance of the xenograft assay. We showed that
primary breast tumors that generate PDXs have more
ALDH1-positive cells (CSCs) and are more prone to form
metastasis in patients than tumors that failed to graft. We
showed that tumor engraftment is an independent prognostic
factor, as strong as lymph node invasion to predict metastasis.
Our study establishes a direct link between primary tumor
engraftment, functionally deﬁned breast CSCs, and patient's
clinical outcome, suggesting that CSCs are not artifacts of the
experimental PDX model but reﬂect intrinsic tumor biology.
Second, we show that the molecular machinery that governs
CSCs is clinically relevant. This crucial issue has been shown in
acute myeloid leukemia, where a functionally deﬁned LSC or
HSC signature is correlated with disease outcome (24). In
breast, an "invasiveness" gene signature generated by comparing CD44þ/CD24/low breast cancer cells with that of normal
breast epithelium is associated with disease outcome (33) and

7298

Cancer Res; 73(24) December 15, 2013

a CD44þ cell signature that contains stem cell markers is
correlated with decreased survival in patients (34). Furthermore, a normal mammary stem cell signature predicts breast
cancer biologic and molecular features, and high-grade tumors
contain more CSCs than low-grade tumors (35). Yet, the
potential link between functionally deﬁned CSCs and engraftment has never been described so far. This approach provides a
paradigm for assessing both the identity and clinical relevance
of CSCs from breast cancer and other solid tumors. Importantly, because our ﬁndings support CSC clinical relevance, it
suggests that therapies targeting CSCs would improve survival
outcome and that xenograft models based on primary breast
CSC engraftment can be crucial in the preclinical evaluation of
new cancer drugs.
Third, the identiﬁcation of shared transcriptional proﬁles in
CSCs and ESC/HSC/NSC suggests that common genes have a
role in establishing and maintaining the stem cell state and
that these shared determinants of stemness inﬂuence clinical
outcome. We identiﬁed a "common" stem cell core transcriptional program. This core of genes common to 4 stem cell gene
expression signatures contains genes implicated in oxidative
phosphorylation, detoxiﬁcation, lipid metabolism, and genomic stability. Some of these genes encode drug resistance
enzymes (UMPS; ref. 36) or cell-cycle regulators through P27
function (GFER; refs. 37, 38). Metabolic alterations in tumor

cells are thought to be important for the tumor phenotype and
evolution and to affect response to therapy (39). In embryonic,
neural, normal, and tumoral breast tissues, stem/progenitor
cells contain lower level of reactive oxygen species than their
more mature progeny, sustaining their relative resistance to
radiation (40, 41). In leukemia, oxidative phosphorylation
triggers genomic instability and is a putative mechanism
explaining relapse after tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment
(42, 43). Noteworthy, aldehyde dehydrogenase, a hallmark of
embryonic, normal adult tissue and CSCs, oxidizes aldehydes
to the corresponding carboxylic acids (44). Furthermore, we
recently identiﬁed the importance of mevalonate metabolism
in the P27-dependent regulation of breast CSCs (45). Our
ﬁndings reinforce recent literature data and suggest that
metabolic therapies anti-CSCs might be a new therapeutic
approach to cure cancer. These novel results however need
further validation.

cell subpopulation that sustains tumor growth and development could help design new therapeutic strategies to cure
cancer. In breast cancer, use of PDXs that mimic human tumor
is increasing to capture tumor heterogeneity and elaborate the
best therapeutic strategy for patients (46, 47). The clinical
relevance of PDXs studies for CSCs in breast cancer suggests
that this model is reliable to test anti-CSC therapies. If conﬁrmed, our data indicate the importance of developing CSC
biomarkers and will move forward a new era of accelerated
transfer for personalized cancer therapy into clinics.
