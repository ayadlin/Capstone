ABSTRACT
We demonstrate that model-based unsupervised learning can uniquely
discriminate single-cell subpopulations by their gene expression distributions, which
in turn allow us to identify specific genes for focused functional studies. This method
was applied to MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with the antidiabetic drug
metformin, which is being repurposed for treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.
Unsupervised learning identified a cluster of metformin-treated cells characterized by
a significant suppression of 230 genes (p-value < 2E-16). This analysis corroborates
known studies of metformin action: a) pathway analysis indicated known mechanisms
related to metformin action, including the citric acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative
phosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction (p-value < 1E-9); b) 70% of these
230 genes were functionally implicated in metformin response; c) among remaining
lesser functionally-studied genes for metformin-response was CDC42, down-regulated
in breast cancer treated with metformin. However, CDC42’s mechanisms in metformin
response remained unclear. Our functional studies showed that CDC42 was involved in
metformin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and cell migration mediated through
an AMPK-independent mechanism. Our results points to 230 genes that might serve
as metformin response signatures, which needs to be tested in patients treated with
metformin and, further investigation of CDC42 and AMPK-independence’s role in
metformin's anticancer mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

aggregate view of the cells in a tissue sample, scRNAseq can simultaneously measure the expression level
of the entire genome in all of the individual cells of the
sample, allowing the characterization of all cell types and
states present [1]. In this work we utilized the benefits of
scRNA-seq to gain insights into metformin’s molecular
mechanisms in MDA-MB231 triple-negative breast cancer

The emergence of high-throughput, single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has allowed investigators
for the first time to determine levels of gene expression
in hundreds of individual cells simultaneously [1]. In

cells. Triple negative is the molecular subtype of breast
cancer for which no highly effective targeted therapy
currently exists [2]. Metformin is the most commonly used
drug for reducing hyperglycemia in patients with type 2
diabetes [3], but is being repurposed for the prevention
and treatment of cancer.
Evidence from in vitro and retrospective studies
[4] suggests that metformin inhibits the growth of triplenegative breast cancer. Multiple mechanisms, including
5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase
AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms,
have been suggested for the metformin effect in cancer
treatment [5, 6]. However, the therapeutic effect of
metformin in the treatment and prevention of TNBC
remains unclear [7, 8], and there are no pharmacogenomic
biomarkers for selecting responsive patients.
Our first preliminary analysis of homogenous
MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells without
metformin treatment demonstrated that distribution of gene
expression in a cell was best described by a combination of
distributions (mixtures). Next, we observed that metformin
response is not uniform across all cells, because we found
some cells whose distributions of gene expressions were
altered differently. To further investigate this non-uniform
response to metformin, we used mixture-model-based
single-cell analysis (MiMoSA) [9], driven by mixturemodel-based unsupervised learning, to infer single-cell
subpopulations (clusters of cells) based on differences
in their distributions, which can be used to drive focused
functional studies. We used unsupervised learning in this
work because of the lack of prior knowledge on gene
expression distribution that characterizes metformin’s
response in triple-negative breast cancer.
To identify cells with altered gene expression
distributions, MiMoSA inferred three clusters of cells,
and in one of them, we observed a group of 230 genes
that were significantly down-regulated (p-value < 0.0006)
during metformin treatment which was sufficient to
pursue with bioinformatics approaches such as pathway
analysis. Several enriched metabolic pathways associated
with metformin response such as the citric acid (TCA)
cycle and respiratory electron transport, oxidative
phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction were also
associated with 230 these genes. In the 230 genes on
these mentioned pathways, nearly 70% of the genes had
multiple functional evidence of anti-cancer mechanisms
and offered little novelty in helping us understand
metformin’s mechanisms in triple-negative breast cancer
[10, 11]. Remaining genes with lesser functional evidence
comprised 24 genes. Included among these 24 genes was
CDC42. CDC42 is known for its effect on cell proliferation
and cell migration. It has been shown to be involved in the
metformin effect on neuroblastoma, and has been found to
be significantly down-regulated in breast cancer patients
treated with metformin [12, 13]. However, mechanisms
by which CDC42 might influence metformin response in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

breast cancer remain unknown. Therefore, we performed
functional characterization of CDC42 in the context of
its role in metformin response in TNBC. Our functional
studies found that CDC42 was involved in metformininduced inhibition of cell proliferation and cell migration
mediated through an AMPK-independent mechanism, a
novel mechanism for metformin’s anti-metastatic action.
This work highlights the benefits of scRNA-seq
and the ability of model-based unsupervised learning
to identify biologically significant, yet subtle effects of
metformin via the suppression of 230 genes in only 6 cells.

RESULTS
Sequencing data characteristics
Cells were treated with 1-mM metformin for 72 hours
before RNA was isolated for single-cell sequencing.
Duplicate assays were performed for baseline and postmetformin treatment. Therefore, we sequenced 192 cells
at baseline and 192 after metformin treatment, referred
to subsequently as baseline cells and metformin-treated
cells, respectively. After quality control was performed
with MAP-RSeq [14], the initial analysis was conducted
on normalized gene expression data. The sequencing data
showed that 20% of the genes had a reads-per-kilobaseper-million mapped reads (RPKM) measure greater than
32 (a heuristic for an acceptable gene expression level to
indicate that the gene is expressed [14]) in 80% or more
of the cells. In the baseline and metformin-treated data
sets, 20 and 18 out of 192 cells, respectively, had total
gene counts under one million, as shown in Figure 1A,
and were excluded from the study. The probability density
function (PDF) of gene expression within each cell showed
mixtures, as illustrated in Figure 1C. This observation was
expected, since not all genes are expected to be uniformly
expressed. In addition, the PDF of gene expression also
had mixtures, as shown in Figure 1D. We observed that
90% of the information in the PDF was contained in at
least two mixtures of the genes. Further, 80% of the genes
in both baseline and metformin-treated cells were not
expressed in at least 90% of the cells. We chose to study
the top fifth percentile of genes (1,170 genes) that were
expressed in at least 90% of the cells and were also among
those with the highest variance.

Baseline and metformin-treated cells
To spatially visualize the baseline and metformintreated cell populations, we combined the two cell
populations and projected them onto the first two principal
components (which accounted for 97% of the observed
variability) from principal component analysis (PCA),
as shown in Figure 1B. We observed that in both cell
populations, a group of cells was predisposed to a different
behavior (right half of the plot) and that metformin-treated

than did baseline cells (spatial separation between baseline
and metformin-treated cells).

analysis showed such dramatic changes in gene expression
across clusters.

Pathway-network analysis

Clusters in baseline and metformin-treated cells

We performed network analysis with 230 genes that
were observed to be down regulated in one metformin
cluster (cluster M2) and upregulated in all other metformin
and baseline clusters, as shown in Figure 2B. The 230
gene network was enriched with 15 ribosomal proteins, 8
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthases, H+ transporting,
mitochondrial complex proteins, 6 cytochrome c oxidases,
and 9 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)
dehydrogenases. Pathway analysis of the 230 gene
network consisted of several enriched metabolic pathways
(FDR < 0.005), including the citric acid (TCA) cycle and
respiratory electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation,
mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurological disease
pathways (listed in Supplementary Table 2). The majority
of the genes (69%) listed in Supplementary Table 2 were
associated with more than two pathways (as shown in
Supplementary Table 1) and were supported by multiple
literature evidences in the Reactome [15] and KEGG
[16] databases. Since, our goal was to identify novel key
regulators involved in regulation of metformin treatment
in breast cancer, we selected 24 genes for further analysis,
genes that are present in the list of significant pathways
(bolded and highlighted in Supplementary Table 2), genes
that have less experimental evidence showing gene-gene
interactions, or genes for which the mechanisms involved
transcription regulation are not well understood in the
context of metformin treatment. Among these 24 genes,
TALDO1, PRPS2, PTGES3, RRM2, DAD1, PAICS,
PARK7, RPL36AL, SRP14, SSR2, CDC42 have been
shown to be down regulated in the presence of metformin
in a rat hepatoma line and breast cancer cells [17, 18].
In addition, CDC42, has also been shown to be
down-regulated in breast cancer patients treated with
metformin. However, the exact mechanism involved in
regulation of CDC42 in response to metformin treatment
is not yet known, thereby making it a candidate for our
functional studies.

For the baseline cells, MiMoSA identified two
clusters, B1 and B2, which contained 158 and 20 cells,
respectively. A visualization of these clusters along the
first two principal components is shown in Figure 1E.
We observed that the two clusters behaved similarly, with
very little variation in their average expression levels for
all genes except for those few that were differentially
expressed between the two clusters. This observation
indicated that the baseline cells were from a homogenous
cell population.
For the metformin-treated cells, MiMoSA identified
three clusters, M1, M2, and M3, which contained 160, 6,
and 12 cells, respectively. The three clusters are shown
projected along the first two principal components in
Figure 1F. Clusters M1 and M3 behaved similarly with
respect to average gene expression, with slightly higher
expression levels in cluster M1. However, cluster M2
was significantly different from clusters M1 and M3
through its spatial separation from M1 and M3, as shown
in Figure 1F. Using hierarchical clustering, we were able
to obtain the same clusters in metformin-treated cells
(Supplementary Section 1).

Differentially expressed genes
We analyzed all five clusters together to determine
specific patterns that might maximize the heterogeneity.
We found that 230 genes (Supplementary Table 2) were
expressed with RPKM greater than 32 in all clusters of
both data sets (B1, B2, M1, and M3) except for cluster
M2 in metformin-treated cells, in which these genes were
completely suppressed. Figure 2A shows the complete
down-regulation of these 230 genes in cluster M2
compared with all other cells in clusters B1, B2, M1, and
M3; the width of the shaded region of the plot is set to
one standard deviation, and we see that the variation of
gene expression for each of the 230 genes in these cells is
very small (Figure 2A). To test the statistical significance
of the expression values for these 230 genes in M2 in
comparison with all other clusters, we performed a MannWhitney U-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test),
where all expression values of these 230 genes in M2
were compared with their expression values in all other
clusters. The p-value of this observation for the 230 genes
in M2 was 0.00552 (p-value of 0.00076 in the KS-test),
making it statistically highly significant. Therefore, at the
0.05 significance level, we rejected the null hypothesis
and concluded that the expression levels of the 230 genes
in M2 and in the other clusters belonged to different
populations. No other combination of genes from cluster

Metformin inhibits expression of CDC42
CDC42 is a ubiquitously expressed small guanosine
triphosphatase (GTPase). It is known to regulate the
dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton and membrane
trafficking for physiologic processes, such as cell
proliferation, mortality, polarity, cytokinesis, and cell
growth. Deregulation of CDC42 can alter the normal
function of cells and has been associated with cancer
development and tumor metastasis [19]. Metformin has
been shown to inhibit cell migration and metastasis,
possibly through its inhibition of EMT and cancer stem
cells [20–22]. TNBC is exquisitely sensitive to metformin

treatment. Mechanistically, metformin dampens TGF-β
signaling, resulting in abrogation of EMT. Further,
metformin can also reduce migration and invasion
of mesenchymal stem-like cells [23]. It is not known
whether or how CDC42 might be involved in metformininduced cellular phenotypes, especially the inhibition
of cell migration, so we performed functional studies to
pursue the possible mechanism(s) involved in CDC42’s
contribution to metformin effect in these cells.

As a first step, we confirmed metformin’s effect on
the down regulation of CDC42. Specifically, we determined
CDC42 expression levels in human MDA-MB-231 triplenegative breast cancer cells before and after metformin
exposure and observed a striking down regulation of CDC42
expression in the presence of metformin (Figure 3A).
To further confirm that this phenomenon was not celltype-specific, we also used SU86, a pancreatic cancer cell
line, and repeated the experiment (Figure 3A, left panel).

We observed a significant decrease in CDC42 mRNA
and protein levels in response to metformin (Figure 3A,
right panel). To determine whether metformin down
regulation of CDC42 at the transcriptional level depended
on AMPK, SU86 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside
(AICAR), an activator of AMPK (Figure 3B). Treatment
with AICAR did not significantly change CDC42
expression. We also performed knockdown of AMPKα1 and
AMPKα2 in those two cell lines. Knocking down AMPK did
not reverse metformin-induced down regulation of CDC42
expression. In fact, down regulation of AMPK also resulted
in decreased CDC42 expression (Figure 3B). Metformin
treatment can activate AMPK. If AMPK activation is
required for metformin-induced down regulation of CDC42,
we would have expected a reversal of CDC42 transcription
level after the down regulation of AMPK. Therefore, taken
together, these experiments suggested that metformininduced down regulation of CDC42 expression levels was
independent of AMPK activation, even though AMPK itself
can regulate CDC42 expression.

the effects of metformin on cell migration. Specifically, we
transfected CDC42 siRNA into SU86 and MDA-MB-231
cells and found that CDC42 knockdown decreased the
migration of both SU86 and MDA-MB-231 cells using a
wound-healing assay (Figure 4A). When a matrigel invasion
assay was used, knocking down of CDC42 also significantly
inhibited the invasion of SU86 and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 4B). Treatment of CDC42 knocked-down cells with
metformin showed a synergistic effect on the inhibition of
cell migration, indicating that CDC42 might contribute to
metformin-dependent inhibition of cell migration. This
possibility was confirmed when cells were transfected
with the wild type (WT), constitutively active (Q61L), and
dominant negative CDC42 (N17) plasmids (Figure 4C). The
inhibitory effect of metformin on migration was partially
reversed in cells transfected with WT or constitutively
active CDC42 (Q61L), whereas metformin consistently
elicited a greater inhibition of migration in cells transfected
with dominant negative CDC42 (N17). These results
suggest that metformin suppresses cancer cell migration
through a CDC42-mediated signaling pathway.
To determine how metformin affects CDC42 gene
transcription, we reviewed the list of 230 genes that
are differentially expressed in cluster M2 cells treated
with metformin. We chose all of those genes that are
known to be involved in transcription regulation. We
used a literature search to identify 34 candidate genes
that play a role in transcription regulation (Figure 5A).
Treatment with metformin led to significant changes
in the expression of several of those candidate genes in
SU86 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5B). We then
identified five candidate transcription regulators that
were consistently down regulated and one gene, ZFP64,
that was significantly up regulated in cell lines after
metformin treatment (Figure 5C). To determine whether
these genes might directly affect CDC42 expression, SU86
and MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected
with siRNAs targeting each of the six candidate genes.
Knockdown of deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminalinteracting protein 2 (DNTTIP2), histone acetyltransferase
1 (HAT1), transcription elongation factor B polypeptide
2 (TCEB2), and 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha (YWHAB)
decreased CDC42 gene transcription in SU86 cells,
whereas knockdown of HAT1, TCEB2, and YWHAB
decreased CDC42 gene transcription in MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 5D, upper panel); those results were also
confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 5D, lower
panel). These results suggest that metformin’s effect
on CDC42 transcription might be mediated through the
regulation of several transcription regulators, including
DNTTIP2, HAT1, TCEB2, and YWHAB.

Knockdown of CDC42 and treatment
with metformin reduces breast cancer cell
proliferation
We next investigated the effect of CDC42 on
metformin response and cancer cell proliferation using
both MTS assay and BrdU labeling [24]. It was shown
previously that inhibition of CDC42 can decrease cancer
cell proliferation [25] and that metformin can inhibit
cell proliferation. We found that overexpression of
wild type (WT) CDC42 can reverse the decrease in cell
proliferation observed after metformin treatment when
compared with empty vector transfected cells treated
with metformin using both MTS assay and BrdU labeling
assay (Figure  3C–3D, left panel). Overexpression of a
constitutively active CDC42 (Q61L) construct showed
a similar effect on cell proliferation in the presence of
metformin (Figure 3C–3D, middle panel). However,
overexpression of a dominant negative CDC42 (N17)
construct did not reverse the metformin-induced inhibition
of cell proliferation (Figure 3C–3D, right panel). These
results indicate that metformin-mediated growth inhibition
involves CDC42.

Metformin inhibits migration and invasion of
cancer cells by inhibiting CDC42
Recent studies have demonstrated that metformin
can block invasion and metastasis for several types of
cancers [26–30]. However, the underlying mechanism is
not well understood. CDC42 plays a key role in regulating
actin dynamics [31–33] and promotes the transendothelial
migration of cancer cells [34]. We set out to determine
whether CDC42 might be an important factor in mediating

cells (clusters) that otherwise would have been missed
with bulk sequencing methods. However, with limited
samples for analysis and the presence of noise, novel
methods are needed to analyze single-cell data; further,
in most cases, the methods need to be tailored to specific
data characteristics.
In this study, we applied a data-driven unsupervised
analysis approach, in which the clustering problem was
driven by the distribution of gene expression profiles of
the cells to identify candidate genes for functional analysis
[9]. That helped identify a unique cluster of only 6 cells
that showed the most dramatic effect in the expression
of 230 genes that were down regulated after exposure
to metformin. Focusing on the subset of the 230 genes
that was related to known metformin and breast cancer
pathways with sufficient statistical significance, we found
that 24 genes were less studied (present only in one
one pathway with FDR < 0.005) Included among these
24 genes was CDC42, down-regulated in breast cancer
treated with metformin. Functional studies revealed this
gene to be involved in metformin inhibition of triplenegative breast cancer cell migration. This result combines
a novel method of unsupervised learning analysis that
allowed us to decide on choosing CDC42 as a candidate
for functional studies. An extensive functional evaluation
of the method’s findings provides novel insights into the
role of CDC42 in metformin response.
In our study, we used the model-based unsupervised
learning method to solve a machine-learning problem
defined as follows: cells are the data samples, and genes
are the features; gene-expression behavior in samples will
be used to infer cell types. One common observation in all
extant work on scRNA-seq analysis is the high-dimensional
nature of the problem. In our study, by combining two
assays for each dataset, we have a total of 192 cells
(data samples) in our analysis to infer cell heterogeneity
using 23,398 genes (features). Thus, the number of data
samples is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than
the number of features that are used to differentiate the
samples, making single-cell analysis a high-dimensional
problem. Further, by excluding genes that either are not
expressed or show similar expression across all samples,
earlier work has found that only a small number of genes
may contribute to cell heterogeneity [35–37].
To reduce the number of genes used to infer cell
heterogeneity, we chose the top fifth percentile of the
expressed genes with highest variance. This reduced the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ratio of the number of genes to the number of cells by
at least one order of magnitude while still capturing 95%
of the expression variability in two principal components.
We found no significant difference in either the raw
counts or the natural log-transformed data in terms of
results. However, we decided to present our results using
raw RPKM measures, for two reasons. First, the idea
behind using the two principal components to project the
results was that genes with maximum variability drive
the separation of the points in lower-dimensional space.
Second, the first two principal components accounted for
96.5% and 0.5% of the observed variability, indicating that
only a few genes were driving variability in the dataset.
Hence, using the raw RPKM measure would offer a larger
divergence of the cells’ PDF than a log transformation of
the RPKM measures would.
The top 5% high-variance genes all have over one
million sequence reads. As shown in Figure 1A, we found
that a fraction of cells had sequencing depths of under one
million reads and excluded them from our study. While
there is significant interest in the single-cell research
community in determining the optimum sequencing depth
per cell for analyses, there is still no standard available to
decide the optimal sequencing coverage. Several studies
have shown that low sequencing depth also allows for
the identification of subpopulations of cells [38–40].
However, there is also evidence that one million reads
suffices to study single cells and that higher sequencing
depth is preferred when studying subtle differences among
cells [41, 42]. With these findings, we justified a higher
sequencing depth because we wanted to seek subtle
variation that metformin introduces in cells. Hence in this
work, we decided that a sequencing depth of one million
reads was a reasonable threshold for this work.
In this work, we assumed that without loss in
generality, the distributions of clusters were finite
Gaussian mixture models with exponential distributions.
This choice of clustering method augurs well for our
observation that gene expressions in our data for a large
population of cells (~100 cells) had mixtures in their
distributions and provided the best model fits for Gaussian
mixture models (GMM) with varying volume and equal
shape (See Supplementary Figure 1). Using the estimated
means and variance of the mixture model, we generated
10,000 random samples. To test whether the PDF of the
generated samples was statistically close to the PDF
from the data, we performed a Mann-Whitney U-test. For
27206

Oncotarget

illustration, we arbitrarily chose a cell, and for this cell
the p-value from the test was 0.7406. At a significance
level of 0.05, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that
the gene expression of the cell chosen and the generated
expression levels from the estimated mixture model were
drawn from identical populations; the result can also be

visually verified by comparing the PDFs in Supplementary
Figure 1. Thus, we made this work truly data-driven by
allowing the clustering to be determined by distributions
in the data instead of by distances or densities. The use of
distances or densities might require stricter assumptions
with regard to data characteristics (e.g., normality) and

will not guarantee consistent answers if the feature space
and its associated variability are large.
By comparing the clusters of cells from MiMoSA,
we identified 230 genes that were significantly down
regulated in one cluster (M2) of metformin-treated cells
but were uniformly well expressed in all other clusters
(p-value of 0.00552), as shown in Figure 2A. This finding
raised the question of whether these 230 genes might
be markers for metformin sensitivity in triple-negative
breast cancer cells. Metformin has been used to treat
type 2 diabetes for decades, but its antitumor effects
were not recognized until recently. Regulation of the
AMPK pathway is thought to be a major mechanism of
metformin’s antitumor activity [6]. Metformin-induced
inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation leads to elevated
levels of cellular AMP, which activates the energy sensor
AMPK [43]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates the
tuberous sclerosis complex (an inhibitor of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR)), leading to the up regulation
of its activity and subsequent mTOR inhibition and
tumor suppression [44]. Despite increasing knowledge
about metformin’s anticancer mechanisms, the exact
mechanisms responsible for these actions remain unclear.
In follow-up functional analyses, we selected one
of the 230 genes that we found to be down regulated
by M2: CDC42, a major player in actin dynamics that
is also down regulated in breast cancer patients treated
with metformin. Metformin has been shown to inhibit
cell migration and tumor metastasis [26–30]. One
mechanism involves metformin inhibition of cancer stem
cells [45, 46]. We therefore also examined a number
of mesenchymal markers described previously [47],
including SOX2, CD44, CD24, CD133, ALDH, OCT-4,
FN1, SNAI2, VIM, FOXC2, MMP2, MMP3, CDH1,
and DSP, at the mRNA level in all clusters. All of these
genes except VIM and CD44 were suppressed in all
clusters (baseline and metformin-treated cells); VIM and
CD44 were equally expressed in all three clusters without
any differential behavior among the clusters, either at
baseline or metformin-treated cells. Our results suggested
additional mechanisms by which metformin might have an
effect on cell proliferation and cell migration, mechanisms
that are not entirely dependent on AMPK activation.
AMPK activation was not required for metformin-induced
down regulation of CDC42 expression (Figure 3B).
However, AMPK could up-regulate CDC42 expression,
since knockdown of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 dramatically
reduced CDC42 level (Figure 3B). We did not observe
any increase or other change in CDC42 level in the
presence of AICAR, a known AMPK activator, probably
because of the very high baseline level of CDC42. These
observations together, the non-AMPK-dependent effect
on the down regulation of CDC42 by metformin was a
major determinant of CDC42’s effect on cell proliferation
and cell migration. The reason was that metformin’s

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ability to inhibit cell proliferation and cell migration was
increased when CDC42 expression was down regulated
(Figure 3C–3D, Figure 4). Furthermore, we found that the
regulation of CDC42 expression by metformin occurred,
at least in part, through the regulation of a series of genes
involved in transcription regulation, including DNTTIP2,
TCEB2, and YWHAB (Figure 5). DNTTIP2 is involved
in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription [48].
HAT1 is a type B histone acetyltransferase involved in the
rapid acetylation of newly synthesized histones. Evidence
suggests that HAT1 moderates the nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) response by regulating the transcription factor
promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) [49]. TCEB2,
a subunit of the transcription factor B (SIII) complex, is
known to activate elongation by RNA polymerase II [50],
and YWHAB acts as a coactivator for several transcription
factors, including Peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) [51].
Notably, several studies demonstrate that
metformin is beneficial for neurodegenerative disease
such as Alzheimer′s disease and Huntington’s disease
[52, 53]. Recently, several studies also reported the
neuroprotective effect of metformin in Parkinson’s
disease model [54, 55]. Energy metabolism disturbance
and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease [56]. Interestingly,
our pathway analysis of the 230 genes revealed pathways
related to Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and
Alzheimer’s disease with over 20 genes in each pathway
(Supplementary Table 1). These pathways are deregulated
in cluster 2 post metformin treatment, suggesting
metformin may play a role in neurodegenerative disease.
However, further studies are needed in order to determine
whether metformin’s effect on neurodegenerative disease
contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin in the
treatment and prevention of TNBC.
In summary, MiMoSA identified cluster M2,
which contained only six cells that showed significantly
differential gene expression with plausible biological
significance after exposure to metformin. In all engineering
and applied-statistics practices, such clusters are generally
discarded as outliers. Thus, it is possible that this is the kind
of subtle-yet-important cell behavior that we can pursue
using a combination of single-cell sequencing technology
and data-driven unsupervised learning methods. Our results
also provide a series of metformin exposure genes. This
230 gene signature needs to be further validated in other
cell lines and clinical samples. We understand that gene
expression has tissue specificity; therefore, it is important
to determine the effect of metformin on these genes in
different cells or tissue types. Our study also has provided
novel insights into the metformin effect on CDC42 through
the regulation of a series of transcription factors. Future
studies should identify how these transcription regulators
influence CDC42 gene expression. The relationship

could also be tested further using clinical samples and by
determining metformin outcomes.

Network analysis was performed using Cytoscape
[60], NetworkAnalyzer [61], and the Reactome database
[62] functional interaction (FI) feature. Linker genes were
included in the network analysis. Through the Reactome
database, and based on information obtained from the
literature or on data evidence, these linker genes were
connected in the network with the gene set we were
investigating. Network parameters, such as number of
edges for each node, neighborhood connectivity, and
degree of connections for each node, were obtained to
determine the size of the node in the network. The size of
the node in the network indicates the degree of connection
with other genes. Hence, the size of the nodes in the
network indicates the gene connectivity. The pathway
enrichment analysis method in Cytoscape was applied
to identify pathways enriched in the network. Gene
annotations were obtained using the UCSC refFlat file.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Human triple-negative breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231 and pancreatic cancer cell line SU86 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in
L-15 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
SU86 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium containing 10% FBS.

Experimental setup and data generation
The primary dataset included 384 scRNA-seq
samples from MDA-MB-231 cells, half of which had
been exposed to metformin. Specifically, MDA-MB-231
cells were plated into 6-well plates (6 × 104 cells per well)
and incubated for 24 hours; half were then exposed to
1 mmol/L metformin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Fresh medium and drug were replaced daily; after 5 days,
cells were resuspended and single cells immediately
captured with the Fluidigm C1 system. Two independent
MDA-MB-231 batches were used, and 96 untreated cells
(control) and 96 metformin-treated cells were captured
from each. Cells from the two independent batches were
captured on two different C1 machines in an orthogonal
design. Sequencing libraries were prepared with the
standard Fluidigm protocol based on SMARTer chemistry
and Illumina Nextera XT. RNA sequencing of 100-bp
paired-end reads was done on an Illumina HiSeq, with an
average of 4.9 million reads/cell.

Mixture model-based single-cell analysis
(MiMoSA)
As the best fit for the mixtures in our data was
Gaussian mixture models (GMM), we used MiMoSA
to cluster the cells so that the method makes use of the
GMM. The MiMoSA workflow uses a model-based
clustering algorithm tailored for data that exhibit mixed
Gaussian distributions in the PDFs [9]. The workflow is
divided into two stages, as illustrated in Figure 1G and 1H.
Stage 1 (Figure 1G): Inputs to this step are the
baseline and metformin-treated RPKM measures from the
MAP-RSeq workflow. [Step i] Remove cells with low gene
counts: We remove cells from the analysis if they have
a total gene count under one million. This allows us to
study cells with high sequencing depth and quality. [Step
ii] Eliminate genes with low variance: The goal here is to
understand the mechanism of metformin in breast cancer
cells. Thus, to observe metformin’s action, we wanted
to capture the maximum variability in gene expression
introduced by metformin in comparison with baseline
cells. We observed that 80% of the genes were found with
low expression (with RPKM less than 32), consistent
with the existing literature, and hence it made sense to
remove these genes from the analysis. In this work, we
chose genes that were in the top fifth percentile of variance
observed across the whole genome. This reduced the
number of genes we used for clustering cells from 23,398
to 1,170. We output the cells with the reduced set of genes
to Stage 2 of MiMoSA.
Stage 2 (Figure 1H): All computations in stage 2 are
performed with an existing R package called MCLUST
[63]. The MCLUST package performs model-based
clustering that makes use of the Gaussian mixture models,
and uses an expectation-maximization algorithm to learn
the model parameters. MCLUST has been widely used

Data preprocessing
Raw Fastq files for 384 RNA-seq single cells
were obtained and processed through the MAP-RSeq
workflow [14] to obtain binary alignment map (BAM)
files, summary alignment statistics, and quality control
visualizations of mapped reads for each single cell. Pairedend RNA-seq reads were aligned using TopHat [57] to the
human genome build NCBI 37.1, which corresponds to
the hg19 human genome assembly from the University of
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC; [58]). Total reads, mapped
reads, unmapped reads, and junction reads were obtained
for each single cell to identify samples with no cells or
low reads. We removed 19 and 15 samples with a total
count of < 1 million reads from further analysis in baseline
and metformin-treated cells, respectively, and the average
total reads in baseline and metformin-treated cells were
3.10 million and 3.02 million, respectively. The geneexpression count data for single cells was obtained using
HTSeq software [59].

The optimal number of clusters is chosen based on the
Bayesian information criteria (BIC) plot: it is the number
at which the scree plot for BIC against the increasing
number of clusters starts to see an asymptotic convergence.
MCLUST outputs a data structure that contains the cluster
label for each data sample (cell), among other clustering
parameters.

siRNA SMARTpool or nontargeting negative control
(Dharmacon) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection
reagent.
The CDC42 plasmids that included WT, N17
(dominant negative), or Q61L (constitutively active)
constructs were gifts from Dr. Daniel Billadeau, Mayo
Clinic Rochester. Plasmids were transfected with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
(qRT-PCR)

MTS cytotoxicity and cell proliferation assay
Metformin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Milwaukee, WI, USA). Drugs were dissolved in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and aliquots of stock
solutions were frozen at −80°C. Cytotoxicity assays
were performed in triplicate at each drug concentration.
Specifically, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates and
mixed with siRNA-complex consisting of 20–50 nmol of
specific siGENOME siRNA SMARTpool or nontargeting
negative control (Dharmacon) and the Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX transfection reagent [64]. After 24 hours,
cells were treated with 10 μL of metformin at final
concentrations of 0, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25,
50, and 100 mmol/L. After incubation for an additional
72 hours, 20 μL of CellTiter 96® Aqueous Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay solution (Promega Corporation,
Madison, WI, USA) was added to each well. Plates were
read in a Safire2 plate reader (Tecan AG, Switzerland) [65].
The MTS assay was used to determine whether
metformin altered cell proliferation. Cells were transfected
with specific siRNA or plasmids for 24 h; 104 cells were
plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and then treated
with metformin or vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)). MTS assays were performed at 0, 24, 48, 72,
96, 120, and 144 hours after metformin treatment.
Cell proliferation was also measured using the
BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Specifically, 5000 cells per well were plated on a 96well plate in triplicate for each of three independent
experiments. SU86 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with CDC42 plasmids, and then treated
with 1–5 mM metformin for 24, 48, and 96 hours. Cell
proliferation was assayed relative to day 0 using the
BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay Kit after incubation with
bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, BrdU)
for 2 h. Cells were then fixed with a fixing solution
for 30 min and subjected to immunostaining with a
monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody and an HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody. After adding substrate of theTMB
(tetramethyl-benzidine) peroxidase to the cells, the cells
were incubated for 30 min in the dark and the stop solution
was added to terminate the reaction. Absorbance was read
at 450 nm using in a Safire2 microplate reader (Tecan AG,
Switzerland).

Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells with
the QIAGEN RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc.,  Valencia, CA,
USA), followed by qRT-PCR performed with the onestep Brilliant SYBR Green qRT-PCR master mix kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Specifically, primers
purchased from QIAGEN were used to perform qRT-PCR
with the Stratagene Mx3005P™ real-time PCR detection
system (Stratagene). All experiments were performed in
triplicate with GAPDH as an internal control. Reversetranscribed Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene)
was used to generate a standard curve. Control reactions
lacked the RNA template.

Western blot analysis
MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed with the CelLytic
M Cell Lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Cell lysate was subjected to electrophoresis
on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, followed by transfer to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk at
room temperature for 1 h and then probed with primary
antibodies against CDC42 at a 1:1,000 dilution (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and β-actin at a 1:1,000
dilution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Protein
bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).

Transient transfection and RNA interference
Specific siGENOME siRNA SMARTpool® reagents
against a given gene as well as a negative control,
siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA, were purchased from
Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO, USA). A second CDC42
siRNA was purchased from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA,
USA). MDA-MB-231 and SU86 cell lines were used to
perform the siRNA knockdown studies. The Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) was used for siRNA reverse or forward
transfection. Specifically, cells were seeded into 96-well
plates or 6-well plates and mixed with siRNA-complex
consisting of 20–50 nmol of specific siGENOME

SU86 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in a
6-well plate and grown to confluent monolayers. Next,
cells were cultured in medium without FBS for 12 h. A
200-µL pipette tip was drawn across the center of the well
to produce a wound area and washed twice with serumfree medium to remove detached cells. Cells were then
treated with a medium containing different concentrations
of metformin (1 or 10 mM) and 1% FBS. (1% FBS permits
cell survival but not cell proliferation.) Subsequently,
images of the wound-healing process were photographed
digitally (×10) at 0, 24, and 48 h. Each value was an
average value derived from three randomly selected fields.

Cell invasion assay using staining
An invasion assay was performed using 24-well
Transwell units with 8-μm-pore-size polycarbonate
inserts. Cells were cultured in serum-free medium for
24 h. The polycarbonate membranes were cultured at 37°C
for 1 h. A cell suspension (100 µL of 1 × 105 cells/mL in
serum-free medium) containing metformin or vehicle was
added into the inner cup of a 24-well Transwell chamber,
which had been coated with 50 µL of Matrigel™ (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). 650 μL of culture
medium containing 10% FBS was added into the lower
compartment as a chemoattractant. After incubation for
24 h, non-invading cells were removed from the upper
surface by gentle rubbing with a cotton-tipped swab. Cells
that had migrated through the Matrigel and the 8-µm-pore
membrane were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
The lower filter was used to count cell numbers in five
random fields under the microscope. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate.
