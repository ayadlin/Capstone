Abstract
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive and incurable subtype of B-cell non–Hodgkin lymphomas.
Although patients often respond initially to ﬁrst-line treatment with chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibodies,
relapse and decreased response to further lines of treatment eventually occurs. Harnessing the immune system to
elicit its exquisite speciﬁcity and long-lasting protection might provide sustained MCL immunity that could
potentially eradicate residual malignant cells responsible for disease relapse. Here, we show that genetic or
pharmacologic disruption of Stat3 in malignant B cells augments their immunogenicity leading to better
activation of antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ T cells and restoration of responsiveness of tolerized T cells. In addition,
treatment of MCL-bearing mice with a speciﬁc Stat3 inhibitor resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation in
malignant B cells and anti-lymphoma immunity in vivo. Our ﬁndings therefore indicate that Stat3 inhibition may
represent a therapeutic strategy to overcome tolerance to tumor antigens and elicit a strong immunity against
MCL and other B-cell malignancies. Cancer Res; 72(17); 4440–8. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Previous studies in murine models of B-cell lymphoma
indicate that generation of effective anti-lymphoma immunity
requires (i) conversion of bone marrow–derived antigen-presenting cells (APC) from a noninﬂammatory (or tolerogenic)
status into inﬂammatory APCs that trigger effective T-cell
responses (1, 2) and (ii) augmentation of the APC function of
the malignant B cells (3). Therapeutic strategies endowed with
the ability of fulﬁlling both requirements might not only lead to
successful eradication of B-cell tumors but also to a longlasting immunity, and the latter is a desirable effect for certain
B-cell malignancies characterized by their high tendency to
relapse.
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is the prototype of a B-cell
malignancy in which relapse is the major challenge to overcome. In spite of a good initial response to ﬁrst-line treatment
with chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibodies, almost all
patients with MCL will eventually relapse, becoming less
responsive to further lines of treatment and ultimately will
succumb to their disease (4, 5). Given these sobering characteristics, MCL has one of the worst prognoses among all BAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Malignant Hematology, 2Drug

cell non–Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL; ref. 6). As such, novel
non–cross-resistant treatment modalities capable of improving the response rate and more importantly able of sustaining
these responses are greatly needed for patients with MCL.
Several lines of evidence point to manipulation of the
immune system as an enticing non–cross-resistant therapeutic
strategy for MCL. The demonstration that immune cells are
able to kill chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells (7, 8) together
with the ﬁndings that T-cell responses can be elicited in
vaccinated patients with MCL (9), and the encouraging
responses observed in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL
treated with immunomodulatory drugs (10, 11) suggest that
harnessing the immune system and, in particular, eliciting its
exquisite speciﬁcity and long-lasting protection might lead to
sustained immune responses in MCL (12).
Given the above rationale, a signiﬁcant effort has been
devoted to identify molecular target(s) capable of inﬂuencing
inﬂammatory pathways in APCs as well as in malignant B cells.
Stats are cytoplasmic transcription factors that are key mediators of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways (13).
One of the members of the Stat family, Stat3, has emerged as a
negative regulator of inﬂammatory responses in a variety of
immune cells (14–16). For instance, we have previously shown
that pharmacologic or genetic disruption of Stat3 in APCs
resulted in diminished production of the anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine IL-10, enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules, and increased release of proinﬂammatory mediators
leading to augmentation of the function of these cells to
effectively prime T cells and restore the responsiveness of
anergic CD4þ T cells (17). These observations prompted us
to ask whether targeting Stat3 in malignant B cells might also
inﬂuence the immunogenicity and inﬂammatory status of

Stat3 Inhibition In B-cell Lymphoma

these cells and whether such an effect might unleash effective
antitumor immune responses in a murine model of MCL.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Six-week-old male BALB/c (H-2d) and C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice
were obtained from the NIH (Frederick, MD). Male BALB/c
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) or C57BL/6 SCID
mice, aged 6 weeks, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice expressing an ab Tcell receptor speciﬁc for amino acids 110 to 120 from inﬂuenza
hemagglutinin presented by I-Ed were a gift by H. von Boehmer
(18). TCR transgenic mice (OT-II) expressing an ab TCRspeciﬁc for peptide 323–339 from ovalbumin (OVA) presented
by MHC class II and I-Ab (19) were provided by Dr. W. Heath
(The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research,
Victoria, Australia). All experiments involving the use of mice
were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of South
Florida College Of Medicine (Tampa, FL).
Tumor cells
Murine A20 lymphoma cells (H-2d) and human JEKO MCL
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. A20 lymphoma cells expressing HA (Hemagglutinin
inﬂuenza) as a model tumor antigen were selected and
grown in vitro as previously described (20). FC-muMCL1
cell line (H-2b) was derived from a tumor-explanted, 1-yearold Bcl-1 transgenic mice injected with pristane intraperitoneally (i.p.; ref. 21). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 15% FBS. All cell lines were
evaluated by ﬂow cytometry for characterization before
experimentation. For in vivo experiments, cells were washed
3 times in sterile Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and
then 1  106 A20 or 5  106 FC-muMCL1 cells were injected either subcutaneously or i.p. into BALB/c or C57BL/6
mice, respectively.
Reagents
LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5, L-2880) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. CPA-7 was provided by S. Sebti (H. Lee Mofﬁtt
Cancer Center, Tampa, FL). CPA-7 was ﬁrst reconstituted in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then further diluted in culture
medium for in vitro or in HBSS for in vivo use.
Transfection of tumor cells
A20 B cells were transfected with either a dominant-negative
variant of Stat3, Stat3b (22, 23), or Stat3c, a mutant form of
Stat3 that is constitutively activated without tyrosine phosphorylation (24). Transfections were conducted via electroporation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).
Brieﬂy, A20 B cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS,
then resuspended at the concentration of 1  107/0.3 mL in
PBS and transferred into an electroporation cuvette. Then, 15
mg of either GFP, Stat3b GFP DNA, or PBS was added and cells
were subjected to a high-voltage electrical pulse of deﬁned
magnitude and length as per manufacturer's instructions. A
similar procedure was followed to transfect A20 cells with a

www.aacrjournals.org

Stat3c expression vector or control vector. Inhibition of Stat3 in
JEKO human MCL was accomplished with siRNA speciﬁc for
Stat3 using Amaxa Nucleofector methodology per manufacturer's protocol (Dharmacon).
Isolation of malignant B cells in vivo
Mice were sacriﬁced and tumor nodules were carefully
dissected from their livers. Tumors were gently mashed in
tissue culture plates and cells were transferred to a conical tube
and washed twice in RPMI-1640. Cells were cultured for 3 hours
at 37 C, 5% CO2, and nonadherent cells were collected for
further experiments.
Immunoblotting
Whole-cell lysates were prepared using modiﬁed radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. Fifty micrograms of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (Millipore) membranes and
incubated overnight with primary antibodies, followed by
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
(Pierce) and ﬁnally, proteins were visualized with a Chemiluminescent Detection Kit (Pierce). Primary antibodies
against phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705), phospho-AKT, and phospho-p42/44 MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-Stat3 and anti-AKT antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase was purchased from Sigma
(Sigma-Aldrich).
In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic inhibition of Stat3
CPA-7 is a platinum-containing compound that disrupts
Stat3 DNA-binding activity, but not Stat5 nor Stat1 in malignant cells (25). For in vitro studies, FC-muMCL1 cells were
treated with CPA-7 alone (30–1,000 nmol/L) or in combination
with LPS (2 mg/mL), and their ability to present cognate
peptide to antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ T cells was determined as
described under In vitro antigen presentation studies. For in
vivo studies, FC-muMCL1 or A20 tumor–bearing mice were
given CPA-7 i.v. at the dose of 5 mg/kg every 3 days as
previously described (26).
In vivo generation of anergized CD4 T cells
Brieﬂy, 2.5  106 CD4þ transgenic T cells speciﬁc for an MHC
class II epitope of HA were injected i.v. into A20HA lymphoma–
bearing mice. Twenty-one days after T-cell transfer, animals
were sacriﬁced and anergized T cells were reisolated from their
spleens as previously described (20). Cytokine production by
reisolated clonotypic CD4þ T cells in response to HA
peptide110–120 presented by A20 B cells was determined as
described under antigen presentation studies.
For induction of antigen-speciﬁc T-cell tolerance in H-2b
tumor–bearing mice, a similar experimental approach was
used, the only difference being that 1  106 anti-OVA CD4þ
transgenic T cells (OT-II) were transferred into animals bearing
an ovalbumin-expressing tumor (B16OVA). Fourteen days
after T-cell transfer, animals were sacriﬁced and anergized
OT-II cells were reisolated from their spleens (17). Cytokine
production by OT-II cells in response to OVA peptide323–339

presented by FC-muMCL1 cells was determined as described
below.
In vitro antigen presentation studies
A20 or FC-muMCL1 cells (1  105 per well) were cultured
with 5  104 puriﬁed naive or tolerized antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ T
cells in the presence or absence of cognate peptide (either
synthetic HA peptide110–120 SFERFEIFPKE for studies with A20
B cells or OVA peptide323–339, ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR for
studies with FC-muMCL1 cells; American Peptide Company)
After 48 hours, supernatants were collected and assayed for IL2 and IFN-g production by ELISA (R&D Systems). Values for T
cells cultured in media alone were routinely less than 10% of
the values for antigen-stimulated T cells.
Flow cytometric analysis
FC-muMCL1 cells were stained with phycoerythrin (PE)
anti-CD5 (53–7.3; BD Bioscience), PE-Cy7 anti-CD19 (1D3; BD
Bioscience), and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate anti-cyclin D1
(DCS-6, Millipore) antibodies. The expression of B7.1, B7.2,
CD40, and MHC class I and II in FC-muMCL1 and A20 B cells
was determined using speciﬁc antibodies (16-10A1, GL1, 1C10,
28-14-8, M5/114.15.2; eBiosience). Fifty thousand gated events
were collected on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Statistical analysis
A 2-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the magnitudes of
cytokine production by clonotypic T cells. Differences in
survival were assessed with the log-rank test.

Results
Genetic manipulation of Stat3 signaling in malignant B
cells inﬂuences antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses in vitro
First, we asked whether genetic manipulation of Stat3 in A20
lymphoma B cells could inﬂuence their intrinsic antigen-presenting capabilities and the responsiveness of antigen-speciﬁc
CD4þ T cells. To inhibit Stat3 in A20 cells, we used a dominantnegative variant of Stat3, Stat3b (22). A20 cells were transfected
with Stat3b (A20-Stat3b) and then cultured in vitro with
syngeneic naive CD4þ T cells speciﬁc for an MHC class II
restricted epitope of HA in the presence or absence of cognate
HA-peptide. As shown in Fig. 1 (left), clonotypic T cells
encountering HA-peptide on A20-Stat3b cells displayed a
signiﬁcantly enhanced production of IL-2 (Fig. 1A) and IFNg (Fig. 1B), relative to those T cells encountering cognate
peptide on either nontransfected (None), mock-transfected
(Mock), or GFP-transfected (GFP) A20 B cells.
In previous studies, we have shown that adoptive transfer of
naive anti-HA transgenic CD4þ T cells into mice bearing A20 B
cell lymphoma, expressing HA as a model tumor antigen
(A20HA), resulted in the induction of antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ
T-cell tolerance. In this system, reisolated T cells from lymphoma-bearing mice were found to be anergic by their failure
to be primed in vivo as well as by their diminished IL-2 and IFNg production in response to in vitro restimulation with cognate
HA-peptide (20). However, as shown in Fig. 1 (right), in vitro

Figure 1. Disruption of Stat3 in malignant B cells augments antigenþ
speciﬁc CD4 T-cell responses. A20 B cells were untransfected (None),
mock transfected (Mock), or transiently transfected with GFP or Stat3b
GFP expression vector. Then, 1  105 transfected or control cells were
incubated with either 5  104 naive (left) or tolerized anti-HA CD4þ T cells
isolated from the spleen of A20HA-bearing mice (right) in the presence of
12.5 mg of HA peptide110–120 SFERFEIFPKE. After 48 hours, supernatants
were collected and assayed for IL-2 (A and C) and IFN-g (B and D) by
ELISA. Values represent mean  SE of triplicate cultures and are
representative of 3 independent experiments ( , P < 0.05 statistically
signiﬁcant for the difference in cytokine production).

incubation of these same tumor-anergized T cells with A20Stat3b lymphoma cells resulted in restoration of T-cell responsiveness to cognate HA-antigen. Indeed, presentation of HApeptide by A20-Stat3b triggered IL-2 (Fig. 1C) and IFN-g
production by tolerant CD4þ T cells (Fig. 1D). In sharp contrast, anergic T cells encountering HA antigen on nontransfected, mock-transfected, or GFP-transfected A20 B cells
remained unresponsive.
Given the above ﬁndings, we next asked whether an opposite
effect would be observed when Stat3 is overexpressed in
malignant B cells. A20 cells were therefore transfected with
Stat3c, a mutant form of Stat3 that is constitutively activated
without tyrosine phosphorylation (24). Unlike naive anti-HA
CD4þ T cells that produce IL-2 and IFN-g in response to
cognate antigen presented by control A20 B cells (Fig. 2A and
B, non-transfected or PC-DNA transfected), CD4þ T cells
cultured with A20-Stat3c cells were rendered unresponsive
given their minimal production of IL-2 (Fig. 2A, Stat3c) and
inability to produce IFN-g in response to cognate antigen (Fig.
2B, Stat3c). Taken together, genetic manipulation of Stat3 in
A20 B cells determines the functional outcome of antigenspeciﬁc T cells and points to Stat3 inhibition as an enticing
approach to overcome T-cell anergy.
Pharmacologic inhibition of Stat3 in murine B-cell
lymphomas augments APC function
Given that inhibition of Stat3 in malignant B cells induces
better activation of antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ T cells and restores
the responsiveness of tolerized T cells, we asked next whether
this positive effect was due to the augmentation of the APC

function of malignant B cells. Therefore, the expression of MHC
and costimulatory molecules was determined in A20 B cells
treated in vitro with CPA-7, a platinum-containing Stat3-speciﬁc inhibitor (25). As shown in Fig. 3, CPA-7–treated A20 B
cells displayed elevated expression of the costimulatory molecules B7.1, B7.2, and CD40. No signiﬁcant changes in the
expression of MHC class I or II molecules were observed
among untreated or CPA-7–treated malignant B cells (data
not shown). However, the expression of MHC class I and II were
increased in A20 cells treated with CPA-7 plus LPS in comparison with cells treated with LPS alone (data not shown).
Recently, Smith and colleagues have developed a murine
model of MCL by injecting pristane i.p. into 1-year-old Bcl-1
transgenic mice (Em-cyclin D1).In these animals, the pattern of
disease consists of diffuse adenopathy, splenomegaly, bone
marrow inﬁltration as well as lung, kidney, and periportal
hepatic inﬁltration. Analysis of tumor explants revealed malignant B cells that coexpress cyclin D1, CD20, and CD5, but lack
expression of CD23, ﬁndings reminiscent of human MCL (21).
A cell line, FC-muMCL1, has been derived from one of these
lymphoma explants and phenotypic analysis conﬁrmed that
they express cyclin D1, CD19, and CD5 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore,

all C57BL/6 mice challenged with 5  106 FC-muMCL1 given
either subcutaneously (black circle) or i.p. (open circle) developed tumors and showed decreased survival (Fig. 4B). In mice
challenged subcutaneously, tumor nodules developed by day
21. Intraperitoneal injection of MCL cells resulted in the
development of ascites by day 30 and at necropsy we found
enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes as well
as tumor nodules in the peritoneum and small bowel (data not
shown).
Next, we determined the in vitro effects of CPA-7 upon FCmuMCL1 cells. First, CPA-7 did not affect the viability or
proliferation of malignant B cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Second, we assessed whether FC-muMCL1 cells can present
cognate antigen to antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ T cells and if so,
whether this intrinsic APC function can be enhanced by CPA-7.
Given the background of FC-muMCL1 cells (H-2b), we assessed
their ability to present ovalbumin peptide to transgenic CD4þ
T cells expressing a abTCR speciﬁc for OVA peptide323–339 (19).
First, anti-OVA CD4þ T cells encountering cognate antigen on
untreated MCL cells (ovalbumin peptide) or in LPS-treated
MCL cells (LPSþOVA) produced IL-2 (Fig. 4C, left) and IFN-g
(Fig. 4C, right) indicative of the ability of murine MCL cells to
present antigen to CD4þ T cells in vitro. This intrinsic APC
function was enhanced following exposure of MCL cells to LPS
in the presence of increasing concentrations of Stat3 inhibitor.
Indeed, CPA-7–treated MCL cells triggered an increased production of IL-2 and IFN-g by CD4þ T cells (Fig 4C; CPA-7þLPS).
Importantly, anergized anti-OVA CD4þ T cells cultured in
vitro with CPA-7–treated FC-muMCL1 cells regained their
ability to produce IFN-g in response to cognate ovalbumin
peptide (Fig. 4D, CPA-7þLPS). In contrast, anergized T cells
encountering ovalbumin peptide on untreated MCL cells
(OVA) or in cells treated with LPSþOVA peptide (in the
absence of CPA-7) remained unresponsive (Fig. 4D). Finally,
reminiscent of our observations in CPA-7–treated A20 B cells,
FC-muMCL cells treated with CPA-7 also displayed enhanced
expression of the costimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2
relative to untreated cells (Fig. 4E). However, no changes in
the expression of CD40 was observed in CPA-7–treated cells
relative to controls (data not shown). Taken together, treatment of murine MCL cells with CPA-7 augments their immunogenicity resulting in enhanced activation of naive CD4þ T

cells.
In vivo inhibition of Stat3 delays progression of murine
B-cell lymphomas
Next, we determined whether CPA-7 inhibits Stat3 signaling
in malignant B cells in vivo. Previous studies have shown that
CPA-7 induces in vivo antitumor responses when used at the
dose of 5 mg/kg given i.v. every 3 days (16). We therefore
injected 5  106 FC-muMCL1 cells i.p. into C57BL/6 mice and
21 days later, animals were treated (or not) with 5 mg/kg of
CPA-7 given i.v. on days þ21, þ24, and þ27. Two days later (day
þ29), animals were sacriﬁced and tumor nodules were dissected from their livers. As shown in Fig. 5A, a decrease in
phospho-Stat3 expression was observed in malignant B cells
isolated from MCL-bearing mice treated with CPA-7. No such
effect was observed in untreated tumor-bearing mice or animals treated with vehicle control. Of note, less tumor burden
was observed in CPA-7–treated mice. These results prompted

4444

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

us to determine the in vivo anti-MCL effect of CPA-7 in a larger
group of animals. C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 5  106
FC-muMCL1 cells given subcutaneously. Half of the mice
received vehicle control and the other half received CPA-7
(5 mg/kg/i.v. every 3 days, starting on day þ5 after tumor
challenge). Unlike untreated MCL-bearing mice, which rapidly
developed tumors (Fig. 5B, solid line), mice treated with CPA-7
had a signiﬁcant delay in MCL tumor growth (Fig. 5B, dashed
line). Of note, analysis of immune cells inﬁltrating MCL lymphoma nodules revealed no differences in intratumoral T-cell
recruitment (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, BALB/c mice
challenged with 1  106 A20 lymphoma cells subcutaneously
and then treated with CPA-7 (same dose and frequency as in
the MCL model) rejected this B-cell tumor (Fig. 5C, dashed
line). No such rejection was observed in A20 B cell lymphomabearing mice given vehicle control (Fig. 5C, solid line). Therefore, in vivo treatment of lymphoma-bearing mice with CPA-7
resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation in malignant B
cells and a strong anti-lymphoma effect.

Stat3 Inhibition In B-cell Lymphoma

Figure 5. In vivo treatment with CPA-7 results in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation in malignant B cells and an anti-lymphoma effect. A, 5  10 FC-muMCL1
cells were injected i.p. into C57BL/6 mice. Twenty-one days later, animals were treated or not treated with 5 mg/kg of CPA-7 given i.v. every 3 days (days þ21,
þ24, and þ27). On day þ29, animals were sacriﬁced and tumor nodules were carefully dissected from their livers. Malignant B cells were then isolated and
the expression of phopho-Stat3 was determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-p-Stat3 (Tyr705) antibody. Shown is a representative of 2
experiments with similar results. B, C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 10) were challenged with 5  106 FC-muMCL1 cells given subcutaneously in the right leg. Half the mice
were then treated with CPA-7 (5 mg/kg) given i.v. every 3 days, starting on day þ5 after tumor challenge (dashed line). The other half of the mice received
vehicle control (solid line). Tumor volumes were calculated (length  width  width  1/2) from measurements as indicated. Two independent
experiments were carried with similar results. C, BALB/c mice (n ¼ 10) were challenged with 1  106 A20 lymphoma cells given subcutaneously in the right leg.
Half the mice were treated with CPA-7 (dash line) and the other half with vehicle control (solid line) as indicated in B. Animals were monitored for the
development of tumor and tumor volumes measured on days indicated. Two independent experiments were carried out with similar results (P < 0.01).

The in vivo antitumor effect of CPA-7 requires an intact
adaptive immune system
Previous studies have shown that disruption of Stat3 in
malignant cells, including MCL cells, resulted in the induction
of apoptosis (27, 28). As such, the in vivo antitumor effect
observed in CPA-7–treated lymphoma-bearing mice (Fig. 5)
could be a reﬂection of a direct effect of this drug upon tumor cells themselves rather than immune effects triggered by
Stat3 inhibition. To address this question, C57BL/6 SCID mice
(Fig. 6A) or BALB/c-SCID mice (Fig. 6B) were challenged with
5  106 FC-muMCL1 cells or 1  106 A20 lymphoma cells given
subcutaneously, respectively. Then, half the mice in each group
were treated with CPA-7 (5 mg/kg every 3 days, starting on day
þ5 after tumor challenge) and the other half received vehicle
control. Unlike immunocompetent lymphoma-bearing mice

treated with CPA-7 in which a strong antitumor effect was
clearly shown (Fig. 5B and C), such an antitumor effect was not
observed in immunodeﬁcient animals treated with CPA-7.
Indeed, no difference in the kinetics of tumor growth was
observed among untreated or CPA-7–treated lymphoma-bearing SCID mice (Fig. 6A and B, MCL and A20, respectively). To
rule out the possibility that CPA-7 might not be affecting its
tumor target in SCID mice, we determined the expression of pSTAT3 in malignant B cells isolated from tumor nodules of
untreated and CPA-7–treated SCID mice. As shown in Fig. 6C,
in vivo treatment with CPA-7 resulted in decreased p-Stat3
expression, an effect that was more pronounced in A20 lymphoma cells. These results indicate that the antitumor effect of
CPA-7 requires an intact adaptive immune system and points
to the immunologic rather than the nonimmunologic

the expression of phopho-Stat3 was determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-p-Stat3 (Tyr705) antibody. Two independent experiments were
carried out with similar results.

antitumor effects of this Stat3 inhibitor, as playing a dominant
role in its in vivo anti-lymphoma activity.
CPA-7 inhibits Stat3 in human MCL
Next, we determined whether CPA-7 would also inhibit Stat3
in human MCL cells. As shown in Fig. 7, p-Stat3 was diminished
in JEKO cells treated in vitro with CPA-7. This inhibition was
speciﬁc as other signaling pathways such as phospho-MAPK or
phospho-AKT were not affected in MCL cells treated with even
higher doses of CPA-7 (30 mmol). The selectivity of this agent is
further highlighted by the demonstration that the phenotype
displayed by CPA-7–treated JEKO cells is recapitulated in cells
in which Stat3 was knocked down using speciﬁc Stat3 siRNA
(Fig. 7, right). Of note, in vitro culture of CPA-7–treated human
JEKO cells with allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells also resulted in enhanced IL-2 and IFN-g production
by T cells as determined by ELISPOT assay (data not shown).
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that genetic or pharmacologic
disruption of Stat3 in malignant B cells increased their immunogenicity leading to augmentation of antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ
T-cell function and restoration of responsiveness of tolerized T
cells. These ﬁndings expand the previously known proinﬂammatory effects of Stat3 inhibition upon other immune cells
such as bone marrow–derived APCs (17, 29, 30). This unique
property of Stat3 inhibition to inﬂuence the inﬂammatory
status of both the malignant B cell as well as the APC points
to pharmacologic inhibition of this signaling pathway as an
appealing strategy to overcome tolerance to tumor antigens
and elicit a strong antitumor immunity.

In the in vivo immune response against B-cell lymphomas, it
is likely that both malignant cells themselves as well as bone
marrow–derived APCs present tumor antigens to antigenspeciﬁc CD4þ T cells. B-cell lymphomas are the transformed
counterparts of cells endowed with antigen-presenting capabilities. Normal B lymphocytes have long been known to
interact with CD4þ T cells during physiologic immune
responses in a process that involves presentation of peptide
MHC class II complexes, along with costimulatory signals to
antigen-speciﬁc T cells (31, 32). Like normal B cells, malignant
B cells also express MHC class I and II molecules and low but
inducible levels of adhesion and costimulatory molecules
(1, 33, 34). In spite of these intrinsic properties, it is quite
paradoxical that B-cell malignancies fail to be eliminated in the
very same compartment lymph nodes where tumor antigen–
speciﬁc T-cell responses are initiated.
Several factors might account for the failure of malignant B
cells to properly activate T cells in vivo. First, their expression of
MHC molecules, costimulatory molecules, and/or adhesion
molecules that participate in T-cell priming might not be
sufﬁcient to trigger full T-cell activation. This "state" of partial
T-cell activation, in the absence of additional signals capable of
sustaining this initial response and/or in the presence of
dominant suppressive mechanisms, might be followed instead
by a state of T-cell anergy (1, 35). Among the active suppressive
mechanisms, the ability of malignant B cells to induce T-cell
immunologic synapse dysfunction (36) together with the ability
of bone marrow–derived APCs to create a tolerogenic environment that favors T-cell anergy over T-cell activation (37–39)
have gained particular attention. It is plausible therefore that
the combination of these mechanisms would be conducive to
T-cell unresponsiveness, a barrier that needs to be overcome if
effective immunity against B-cell tumors is to be generated.
In the past several years, a number of therapeutic
approaches have sought to improve the antigen-presenting
capabilities of malignant B cells by either genetically modifying
these cells to enforce the expression of adhesion and costimulatory molecules as well as proinﬂammatory cytokines (40–
43), or by repairing a dysfunctional T-cell immunologic synapse with immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide (36).
Other approaches have focused instead on the induction of
inﬂammatory APCs as a strategy to improve cross-presentation of tumor antigens to antigen-speciﬁc T cells (3, 44).
Although each of these approaches induced productive
immune responses, the duration and magnitude of these
effects were transient and not strong enough to fully eradicate
systemic lymphoma. A potential explanation for their limited
success is that they have targeted either the malignant B cell or
the APC, but not both, and as such, they were unable to fully
overcome tolerogenic mechanisms in cancer. Therefore, from a
therapeutic perspective, it would be desirable to ﬁnd novel
approaches with the dual ability of enhancing the antigenpresenting function of malignant B cells and inducing inﬂammatory APCs displaying enhanced cross-presentation of tumor
antigens to antigen-speciﬁc T cells.
Inhibition of Stat3 signaling represents a novel strategy given
its known ability to inﬂuence the inﬂammatory status of the
APC (17, 29, 45) and, as shown here, to augment the APC

Stat3 Inhibition In B-cell Lymphoma

function of malignant B cells. Indeed, treatment of malignant B
cells with CPA-7 rendered these cells better activators of
antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ T cells and capable of restoring the
responsiveness of tolerant T cells isolated from lymphomabearing mice. In addition to these in vitro effects, treatment of
MCL-bearing mice with CPA-7 decreased Stat3 phosphorylation in tumor cells and resulted in protective immunity. Of note,
the lack of antitumor activity in immunodeﬁcient mice treated
with CPA-7 points to the effects of Stat3 inhibition upon
immune cells as being essential for effective lymphoma eradication in vivo. It should be mentioned that our in vivo results in
SCID mice are at odds with the results reported by Wang and
colleagues who treated SCID mice bearing human SP53 or
Grant 519 MCL cells with Atiprimod, a compound known to
inhibit Stat3 (27). Unlike our study, SCID mice treated with
Atipromid had signiﬁcantly less tumor burden compared with
control mice, pointing to a direct antitumor effect of this
compound upon MCL cells. Several differences between their
study and ours might explain these seemingly divergent outcomes. First, unlike CPA-7, which mainly inhibits Stat3 without
affecting other signaling pathways in human MCL (Fig. 7),
Atipromid is a less selective inhibitor of Stat3 as it also activates
c-jun-NH2-kinase and inhibits NF-kB, an important survival
pathway that is constituvely activated in MCL. It is plausible,
therefore, that the antitumor effect observed in their study
could be related to the targeting of pathway(s) other than Stat3.
Second, in our in vivo studies, mice were challenged with
murine MCL cells, whereas in their study, SCID mice were challenged with human MCL cells. Third, there were also differences in the dose and frequency of in vivo administration of
CPA-7 and Atipromid (CPA-7: 5 mg/kg/i.v. every 3 days, starting
on day þ5 after tumor challenge vs. Atipromid: 25 mg/kg/i.p.
daily for 6 days starting 3–4 weeks after tumor challenge).
Our demonstration that Stat3 inhibition is an effective
strategy in a murine model of MCL provides the framework
for its future combination with agents able to repair defective
T-cell immunologic synapse, such as lenalidomide, or as
adjuvants to lymphoma vaccines. Furthermore, our ﬁndings,
together with the demonstration that Stat3 is constitutively
activated in human MCL cells (46, 47), provide the basis for
evaluating the clinical efﬁcacy of Stat3 inhibition in human
MCL. Of note, inhibition of Stat3 in tumor cells displaying
aberrant activation of this pathway has been shown to result in
"inﬂammatory death", a process associated with release of
proinﬂammatory mediators that could amplify ongoing anti-

tumor immune responses also triggered by the effects of Stat3
inhibition upon APCs and other immune cells (26, 48). This
proinﬂammatory environment generated by Stat3 inhibition is
further enhanced by the inability of malignant B cells and
immune cells to produce IL-10 in the absence of intact Stat3
signaling (15, 17). Such a lack of production of IL-10 has the
dual advantage of not only diminishing the generation of an
immunosuppressive environment but also depriving malignant B cells of an important survival factor (49, 50).
Taken together, the dual effects of Stat3 inhibition upon
both the malignant B cells as well as immune cells triggers a
positive loop of proinﬂammatory events that likely generates
an activating rather than a tolerogenic environment in the
lymph nodes, which might be ultimately conducive to effective
antilymphoma immunity. Such a unique property of Stat3
inhibition makes this approach suitable for future evaluation
in human MCL and other B-cell malignancies, either alone or in
combination with lenalidomide, or as an adjuvant to therapeutic vaccines.
