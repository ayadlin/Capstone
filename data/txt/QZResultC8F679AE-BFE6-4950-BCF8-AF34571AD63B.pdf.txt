Leukemia is the most common pediatric cancer. Despite great progress in the development of curative therapy, leukemia remains a
leading cause of death from disease in childhood, and survivors are at life-long risk of complications of treatment. New agents are
needed to further increase cure rates and decrease treatment-associated toxicities. The complex biology and aggressive nature of
childhood leukemia, coupled with the relatively small patient population available for study, pose specific challenges to the development of new therapies. In this review, the authors discuss strategies and initiatives designed to improve access to new agents in the

INTRODUCTION
Leukemia is the most common malignancy of childhood, representing approximately 25% of cancers diagnosed in children aged <20 years.1 Although survival rates have improved dramatically over the past several decades, leukemia remains
No.1 of the leading causes of death from disease in children. In addition, the majority of those who are cured are at risk of
short-term and long-term complications of therapy.2-9 Thus, there is a need to develop safe and effective new treatments
to increase the cure rate for children with high-risk disease, optimize therapy for children with low-risk disease, and minimize associated toxicities.
There are many challenges that serve to impede the development of new therapies for children with leukemia. These
include the multiple phenotypic and molecular subtypes, the commonly aggressive nature of relapse with rapid disease
progression, and the complex array of medical comorbidities frequently encountered in individuals with relapsed/refractory leukemia. Compounding these difficulties are the growing numbers of novel therapeutics in the face of the relatively
small numbers of patients available for study. Despite the many common clinical and biologic features of leukemias in
children and adults, there are important differences that must be considered with regard to pediatric therapeutic development. For example, there is marked age-related variation in the frequency of specific genotypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).10 Similarly, drugs used to treat leukemia may have variable effects based on age-associated pharmacokinetic
and pharmacogenetic variation with impact on efficacy and toxicity.2,7,9,11-13 The high cost of new agent development in
the context of the limited pediatric market and the possible need for a different oral formulation for young children pose
additional deterrents for the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, testing new agents in a high-risk pediatric leukemia
patient population is extremely complex, challenging, and resource intensive. In addition, new drugs often need to be
tested not only as single agents but also in combination, which further complicates and extends clinical development. In
this review, we discuss strategies and initiatives designed to improve access to new agents and to speed the development of
new therapies for pediatric leukemia.
Biologic and Preclinical Studies

Critical to new drug development in the era of molecularly targeted oncologic therapy are biologic and preclinical studies
designed to define “druggable” targets and pathways. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established 2 programs to
specifically foster preclinical study of childhood cancer in support of new agent development.

Effective Treatments (TARGET) Program (available at:

epigenomic approaches to facilitate the discovery of
new molecular targets for childhood cancers; and

at: http://pptp.nchresearch.org/; accessed August 30, 2014),
which is an initiative that uses well characterized xenograft
mouse models and cell lines for preclinical testing to facilitate new drug selection for study in phase 1 clinical trials.14
As examples of some initial successes, the TARGET
program identified new genetic alterations in high-risk
ALL, including IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) deletion, Janus kinase (JAK) mutation, cytokine receptorlike factor 2 (CRLF2) rearrangement, and Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph)-like subtype, which could lead to the
identification of new targeted treatment strategies.15-23
The potential relevance of preclinical studies was exemplified by the PPTP study of dasatinib (Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), which induced complete remissions (CRs) in Ph-positive ALL murine xenograft models.24 In a phase 1 trial, this agent exhibited
substantial activity in Ph-positive ALL and chronic myeloid leukemia.25,26 Further evidence of the possible clinical importance of such studies is illustrated by the
successful use of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson
murine leukemia virus (BCR-ABL) kinase inhibitor imatinib (Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) in a child who had Phlike ALL that was resistant to chemotherapy.27

These approaches need to be further validated and
all data carefully analyzed in relation to clinical results.
Misinterpretation and low reproducibility of preclinical
data are common and can result in the termination of oncology drug development.28,29 It is important that the
predictive power of in vitro and animal model testing for
drug screening should never be assumed. For example,
although aurora kinase inhibitors have demonstrated activity in various preclinical cancer models,30-32 clinical
trial results in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
have been disappointing.33 The lack of activity in patients
may be caused in part by the much longer doubling time
for cancer cells in humans compared with the doubling
times for in vitro cell lines and xenograft models.33
Clinical Studies
Early phase clinical trial groups

The international pediatric oncology community has
worked together effectively through multicenter clinical
trial consortia, the first of which was formed in 1955 (available at: www.childrensoncologygroup.org; accessed August
30, 2014). By treating children in carefully designed and
executed clinical studies, the cure rate for childhood ALL
has increased from about 10% fifty years ago to approximately 90% today.34 Several pediatric early phase clinical
trial consortia have been established that are helping to
advance the development of new therapies for children
with leukemias (Table 1). The member institutions of these
early phase clinical trial groups comprise large premier academic pediatric oncology centers working closely together

to rapidly test new agents in childhood cancer. Because
most of the members participate in the large cooperative
groups, the trials conducted by these consortia often provide data in support of subsequent phase 2 and 3 studies.
Selecting agents for pediatric clinical trials

New therapies are almost always studied first in relapsed/
refractory patients for whom there are no standard therapies available. Because most pediatric leukemia patients
are cured by frontline chemotherapy, there are only about
600 first relapse cases annually in the United States.1 Typically, phase 1 studies require an average of 20 to 40
patients to complete35; and, currently, there are more
than 380 new agents and more than 600 first-in-class
medicines in various stages of study for hematologic
malignancies.36 Selected agents that have recently been
tested in pediatric leukemias are listed in Tables 2 and 3.
Unlike many patients with solid tumors who may be able

to move from one phase 1 trial to another, children with
leukemia often progress rapidly and become ineligible for
subsequent study. How to strategically choose and prioritize agents for study from the large array of available therapies and potential targets remains a great challenge. There
are limitations to selecting agents purely on the basis of
target identification and/or preclinical data, as discussed
above, although this is commonly used as a starting point.
Loong and Siu listed the favorable characteristics for a
drug to enter phase 1 testing,62 including:
 Robust, reproducible preclinical data verified in multiple models by independent resources;
 Established correlative biology studies that can be used
as biomarkers of efficacy and resistance; and
 Potentially better efficacy and/or safety profile compared with licensed drugs with similar mechanisms of
action that justify clinical testing.

New Agents for Childhood Leukemia/Sun et al

Even if all of these criteria are adhered to, there are
not enough pediatric patients with leukemia to study all
such agents. Thus, the portfolio of available agents should
be strategically examined and prioritized to determine
which should be tested and in what order.
It is noteworthy that, based on historic experience,
most candidate agents fail and disappear from further development. In a recent study of drug development data
from 835 companies covering the years from 2003 to
2011, the success rate for oncology drugs was the lowest
among all diseases: only 1 in 15 drugs that entered a phase
1 trial achieved US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval.63 Investing scarce pediatric patients in
trials of agents for which the future supply is uncertain
may prove to be futile and wasteful. To reduce this risk,
assessment of whether to continue or abandon agent development should be determined as rapidly as possible
based on early results, positive or negative, and ongoing
consideration of the security of drug supply.
To deal with many of the challenges noted above
and to increase the likelihood that an agent will be active,
have an acceptable toxicity profile, and ultimately be
developed for commercial use, many drugs are selected for
study in children only after they have undergone initial
evaluation in adults. Although, by definition, this leads to
a delay in pediatric development, in many cases, this
approach improves the chances of successful pediatric development and long-term availability for use in children.
Phase 1 trial design

Among the challenges to conducting phase 1 trials in pediatric leukemia, as discussed above, are the limited number of patients and, thus, the limited amount of
information that can inform the selection of a best dose
and schedule. The most prevalent phase 1 design is the
standard 3 1 3 design,64 but alternative designs have
been developed and studied.65,66 One recently popular
alternative, the rolling 6 design,67 has been incorporated
into many COG and Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia and Lymphoma (TACL) phase 1 trials.
It is a modification to the standard 3 1 3 design in an
attempt to shorten the duration of the phase 1 trial. The
main difference is that patients are continually accrued
based on the data available at the time of enrollment to
allow up to 6 patients on a given dose cohort. Compared
with the standard 3 1 3 cohort design, the length of time
that studies are suspended to accrual is reduced67; the
trial duration, on average, is somewhat shorter; and the
number of patients required, on average, is larger, with
statistical properties equivalent to those of the 3 1 3

design.68 Continuous reassessment designs have also
been used in pediatric studies.69 Phase 1 studies, of necessity, are small in patient numbers and, hence, imprecise.
Although certain designs may be somewhat more precise
or efficient in identifying a maximum-tolerated dose for
specific situations, these differences will not be large, and
there is no uniformly “best design” for use in all scenarios. Hence, it is important to screen agents rigorously in
preclinical studies and also to extract as much information as possible about the efficacy of agents from phase 1
studies.
When trials in adults have already been completed,
one approach to shorten the time it takes to conduct a pediatric phase 1 trial is to use limited dose levels based on
the adult recommended phase 2 dose.70 In that regard,
limiting pediatric phase 1 trials to the study of no more
than 4 dose levels at 0.7 times, 1.0 times, 1.3 times, and
1.6 times the adult maximum-tolerated dose has been
proposed as a method for significantly shortening the
study timeline without compromising the outcome.
It is noteworthy that parallel, rather than sequential,
studies in adults and children have been conducted in an
effort to shorten the lag time to pediatric investigations.
For example, pediatric and adult phase 1 studies of clofarabine (Sanofi US, Bridgewater, Conn) were conducted
simultaneously. In that instance, a modified 3 1 3 design
was used in the pediatric study in anticipation of slower
accrual, such that children were allowed to enter at 1 dose
level below the determined safe dose level for adults to
speed dose escalation.66 Similarly, an accelerated titration
design has been incorporated into some pediatric phase 1
studies in an attempt to shorten the dose-escalation time,
speed trial completion, and reduce the number of undertreated patients.35 This approach was used in a pediatric
phase 1 trial of moxetumomab pasudotox (MedImmune,
Gaithersburg, Md), which was conducted in parallel with
adult studies.71
Increasingly, early phase trials are incorporating correlative biologic studies aimed to identify and assess biomarkers for target validation.72 When a new compound
has a well characterized molecular target and compelling
preclinical data in a biologically defined patient population, it may be justified to enroll the specific subpopulation in phase 1 trials to probe for an early signal about the
possible response.62 The right “stuff”73 (ie, the right drug,
target, and patient population) could be tested as early as a
phase 1 trial. For example, the TACL consortium recently
completed a phase 1 study testing the FLT3 inhibitor
AC220 in combination with chemotherapy in childhood
leukemia. Because a small subset of patients with pediatric
1931

Review Article

ALL (those with mixed lineage leukemia [MLL] rearrangement or hyperdiploid with >50 chromosomes) has
had over-expression of FLT3 identified and has responded
to FLT3 inhibitors in vitro,74 these 2 ALL subtypes also
were included in the phase 1 trial, and this upfront enrichment strategy enhanced accrual and biomarker
evaluation.75
The traditional approach to testing single agents can
be problematic for patient accrual in childhood leukemia.
Historically, single-agent phase 1 trials often have
reported CR rates below 10%,76 whereas multiagent
chemotherapy regimens have reported CR rates of
approximately 25% to 40% in the setting of multiply
relapsed ALL and acute myeloid leukemia.73,77,78 Physicians, patients, and families may be hesitant to enroll onto
single-agent trials. For example, a phase 2 trial of the antiCD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (Genzyme
Corporation, Cambridge, Mass) in children with relapsed
ALL conducted by the COG was closed prematurely
because of poor accrual.53 Because many new agents have
completed phase 1 evaluation in adults before conducting
tests in children, the TACL consortium encourages the
study of new agents on multiagent “backbone” chemotherapy regimens. This approach may reduce the difficulties in enrollment for and completion of early phase
leukemia trials, because the backbone chemotherapy regimen offers the possibility of additional disease control
even if a CR is not achieved. This approach is also clinically relevant, because any active, novel agent is likely to
be used eventually in the context of multiagent chemotherapy. Carefully defining the toxicity profile of the
novel agent in the background of a combination regimen
is both challenging and important. A proposed approach
is to compare the observed adverse events against the
expected safety profile for the backbone alone while also
considering the known toxicities uniquely associated with
the new and standard agents.79
Funding clinical trials

New drug development is costly. The average estimated
cost to bring an oncology drug to market is approximately
$1 billion US dollars.80,81 In contrast, funding from the
NCI for childhood leukemia in fiscal year 2013 was
approximately $77 million US dollars (available at: www.
nih.gov; accessed June 1, 2014). The financial market for
pediatric oncology is very small. Each year, the number of
children diagnosed with leukemia is a tiny fraction of the
number of patients diagnosed with the more common
adult cancers. Thus, from the standpoint of the for-profit
industry, it is not practical to develop new agents specifi1932

cally for pediatric diseases. Pediatric oncology relies heavily on a “codevelopment” model of agents that share
similar pathways or targets in cancers of adulthood and
childhood. For example, the anti-CD22 immunotoxin
moxetumomab pasudotox is very active in hairy cell leukemia, a disease encountered only in adult populations.82
Because CD22 is expressed in almost all childhood Blineage ALL, this agent is now being tested in children
with relapsed ALL (NCT00659425 and NCT02227108;
available at: clinicaltrials.gov; accessed December 31,
2014).46 Similarly, crizotinib (Pfizer, New York, NY),
now approved by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer, is being tested in ALK-positive neuroblastoma
(NCT00939770; available at: clinicaltrials.gov; accessed
December 31, 2014). Such agents are much less likely to
be developed in the absence of an indication for adults.
Identifying an industrial collaborator is even more difficult for agents that have a limited patent duration. Consequently, it is recommended that pediatric trials begin
early in the development process, although sponsors commonly wait until the medical oncology indications and
market are defined.
US Federal Agency Initiatives

The US government has recognized the challenges in pediatric drug development. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine
and the National Research Council of the National Academies issued a report: Making Better Drugs for Children
with Cancer.83 That report made 3 primary recommendations designed to reduce the delays in pediatric testing of
new cancer drugs under development for adult cancers:
1. A new public-private partnership, involving government, industry, academic, and other research institutions, advocacy groups, philanthropies, and others,
should be formed to lead pediatric cancer drug discovery and development;
2. The NCI should assume responsibility as the developer
of last resort for agents that demonstrate promise only
in children if companies decide not to proceed with
full-scale development; and
3. The pharmaceutical industry, NCI, and FDA should
act to reduce the delay in beginning pediatric clinical
studies of agents in development for adult cancers.
In an example of the success of this approach, in
2009, the NCI allocated $8 million to produce a 2-year
supply of the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody ch14.18
based on results from a phase 3 clinical trial in neuroblastoma.84 Through the NCI’s Biopharmaceutical

Development Program, sufficient product was manufactured to treat patients with neuroblastoma as a transition

Additional federal initiatives have been designed to
improve access to new agents and to accelerate pediatric
drug research:
 The Pediatric Oncology Subcommittee of the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (available at: http://
www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/; accessed June 1,
2014) is an advisory committee that holds annual public meetings to discuss issues related to the development
of pediatric oncology drugs and provides guidance to
facilitate pediatric studies; and
 ClinicalTrials.gov (available at: https://clinicaltrials.

registry and database of results from publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants
conducted around the world that provides public access
to clinical trials information, including negative results
that may be a low priority for publication.
In addition, several legislative acts have been passed
to accelerate pediatric drug development:
 The Orphan Drug Act was passed in 1983 to give financial incentives to stimulate the development of products
for rare diseases85 and has led to an increasing number of
pediatric marketing approvals over the past decade86
with modest impact in childhood leukemia. Under the
Act, clofarabine and asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi
(Cigna, Bloomfield, Conn) have been approved as
orphan drugs in pediatrics. It is noteworthy that these
also are the only oncology drugs that have been approved
for pediatric indications in advance of adult approvals.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA),
which was signed into law in 2002, is a program that
directs the FDA to request pediatric studies from sponsors to address public health needs in children. If the
sponsor fulfills the request, then the FDA will grant an
additional 6 months of exclusivity on the drug. However, this is a voluntary program, and the incentives do
not apply to biologic agents like immunotherapy drugs,
generic agents, or off-patent drugs.87
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which was
enacted in 2003, gives the FDA the authority to require
pediatric studies of drugs or biologics when other
approaches are insufficient to ensure safety and efficacy
in children. PREA is triggered and a pediatric assessment is required when sponsors file a New Drug
Application.87

 The Creating Hope Act, which was passed in 2012,
expands the cost-neutral FDA Priority Review Voucher
program for rare pediatric diseases, including childhood
cancer.88 When a company develops a drug exclusively
for a pediatric rare disease, if qualified, the company
can obtain a voucher that can be used to obtain priority
review for another product, which could decrease the
target time for FDA review from 10 to 6 months.89
The BPCA and PREA, which were signed into law
permanently in 2012, have greatly accelerated pediatric
drug development. They require that drug companies
submit pediatric plans at the end of phase 2 trials.90 However, it is noteworthy that the PREA applies to drugs
developed for diseases that occur in both children and
adults, and it does not address pediatric-specific conditions (eg, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia).
Access to Investigational Drugs Outside of a
Clinical Trial (Single-Patient/Compassionate
Use)

Expanded access, also sometimes known as
“compassionate use,” is mechanism for providing an
investigational drug outside of a clinical trial to treat a
patient with a serious or immediately life-threatening disease.37 This allows the occasional use of an investigational
agent for patients who do not meet protocol eligibility criteria. For example, the first pediatric use of the anti-CD3/
anti-CD19, bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab
(Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif) was through a compassionate use mechanism in Germany for 3 children with
relapsed ALL after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. The agent reportedly was well tolerated
and induced minimal residual disease-negative CRs.43
That experience provided further rationale for and fostered additional interest in pediatric trials of this agent.
Conclusions

Through the coordinated and collective efforts of the
global pediatric oncology community, survival rates for
children with leukemia have improved greatly over the
past 5 decades. Further progress will require continued
investment in preclinical research, because new oncology
drug development is very much biologically driven. This
has proven true in the case of small-molecule kinase inhibitors like imatinib91 and has demonstrated great potential
based on the initial studies of cellular immunotherapy,
such as CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.38,39 New technologies like next-generation sequencing will need to be carefully analyzed and validated as they
1933

are used to identify novel agents to target specific pathways or molecules.
Agents should be prioritized for study based on all
available data, and phase 1 trials should be designed to
efficiently accrue; probe for response signals; and, whenever possible, incorporate biologic studies for target validation, optimum biologic dosing assessment, and the
elucidation of mechanisms of resistance. If a new agent
appears to be too toxic and/or ineffective, then trials
should be quickly halted and negative results published.
Multicenter clinical trials greatly facilitate patient
access and accrual. Collaboration between pediatric clinical trial consortia in North America, Europe, and Australia has further fostered pediatric oncology drug
development. The expansion of global collaborations to
other regions, such as Asia and South America, should further increase access to novel agents for children with leukemia, although associated regulatory hurdles will need to
be overcome. With the anticipated continued rise in the
cost of drug development, partnerships between academia, governmental agencies, industry, philanthropic
organizations, and advocacy groups will assume an
increasingly important role.
