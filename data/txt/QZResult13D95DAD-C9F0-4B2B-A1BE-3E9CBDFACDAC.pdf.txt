ABSTRACT:
We previously reported MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase) as
a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer. MELK was also reported to be highly
upregulated in multiple types of human cancer. It was implied to play indispensable
roles in cancer cell survival and indicated its involvement in the maintenance of
tumor-initiating cells. We conducted a high-throughput screening of a compound
library followed by structure-activity relationship studies, and successfully obtained
a highly potent MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 with IC50 of 0.41 nM. OTSSP167 inhibited
the phosphorylation of PSMA1 (proteasome subunit alpha type 1) and DBNL (drebrinlike), which we identified as novel MELK substrates and are important for stem-cell
characteristics and invasiveness. The compound suppressed mammosphere formation
of breast cancer cells and exhibited significant tumor growth suppression in xenograft
studies using breast, lung, prostate, and pancreas cancer cell lines in mice by both
intravenous and oral administration. This MELK inhibitor should be a promising
compound possibly to suppress the growth of tumor-initiating cells and be applied
for treatment of a wide range of human cancer.

INTRODUCTION

HER-2, estrogen receptor, or progesterone receptor[6],
no effective targeted therapy is presently available[5, 7].
Hence, the development of novel targeted drugs for such
patients is urgently awaited.
We identified maternal embryonic leucine zipper
kinase (MELK), that is a member of the AMPK serine/
threonine kinase family and is involved in the mammalian
embryonic development[8], to be a promising drug
target molecule for breast cancer[9]. MELK was also
overexpressed in various types of human cancer including
TNBC and its expression was hardly detectable in
normal tissues except the testis[9-11]. In addition to
the involvement in cancer cell growth, MELK was also
reported its critical roles in formation or maintenance of

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy
among women worldwide[1]. More than 1.3 million
patients are newly diagnosed with breast cancer each
year, and over 400,000 patients died of the disease[2].
Treatments acting on molecular targets such as estrogen
receptor or HER-2 for breast cancer have successfully
improved the mortality rate, but a subset of the patients
can still have little benefit with these therapies[3, 4].
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the breast
cancer subtypes, develops more frequently in younger
women and is known to be more aggressive with poor
prognosis[5]. Since TNBC does not expresses either of

cancer stem cells[12, 13], that have the ability to selfrenew and differentiate. Emerging evidence indicated
that the cancer stem cells are resistant to chemotherapy
and radiation therapy, and are associated with the cancer
relapse[14, 15]. Thus, targeting cancer stem cell is
considered as a novel strategy for cancer treatment[16,
17]. The mechanisms how cancer cells acquired these
abilities are not yet understood, but recent studies
indicated that MELK is one of the marker molecules to
characterize cancer stem cells in tumor, such as breast
cancer and glioblastoma[13, 18]. Thus, targeting MELK
could be an effective strategy to treat multiple types of
human cancer.
In this study, we report development of a smallmolecule MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 that can selectively
and effectively inhibit MELK kinase activity. Our in vitro
and in vivo studies also imply that OTSSP167 significantly
suppresses mammosphere formation of breast cancer
cells as well as the growth of human cancer-derived
xenografts in mice, implying that OTSSP167 has great
potential to apply as a novel therapeutics for cancer in
a MELK-dependent manner. Furthermore, to verify the
molecular mechanism of this MELK-specific inhibitor, we
demonstrate identification of new substrates of MELK and
inhibitory effect of the compound on activities of these
molecules in breast cancer cells.

value of 0.41 nM (see Supplementary Methods for the
compound synthesis and the kinase assay). OTSSP167
has a 1,5-naphthyridine core with methylketone at
the
3-position,
trans-4-((dimethylamino)methyl)
cyclohexylamino at the 4-position, and 3,5-dichloro-4hydroxyphenyl at the 6-position of the core.

RESULTS

We subsequently investigated in vivo anti-tumor
effect of OTSSP167 by a xenograft model using MDAMB-231 cells (MELK-positive, triple-negative breast
cancer cells). The compound was administered to mice
bearing xenografts for 14 days after the tumor size
reached about 100 mm3. The tumor size was measured
as a surrogate marker of drug response (tumor growth
inhibition (TGI)). Intravenous administration of
OTSSP167 at 20 mg/kg once every two days resulted in
TGI of 73% (Fig 3A). Since the bioavailability of this
compound was expected to be very high (data not shown),
we attempted oral administration of this compound. The
oral administration at 10 mg/kg once a day revealed TGI of
72% (Fig 3B). Due to the strong growth-suppressive effect
on various cancer cell lines, we further investigated in vivo
growth-suppressive effect using cancer cell lines of other
types and found significant tumor growth suppression by
OTSSP167 for multiple cancer types in dose-dependent
manners with no or a little body-weight loss (Fig 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). For example, mice carrying
A549 (lung cancer) xenografts that were treated with 1,
5, and 10 mg/kg once a day of OTSSP167 by intravenous
administration revealed TGI of 51, 91, and 108%,
respectively (Fig 3C) and those by oral administration of
5 and 10 mg/kg once a day revealed TGI of 95 and 124%,
respectively (Fig 3D). In addition, we examined DU145
(prostate cancer) and MIAPaCa-2 (pancreatic cancer)
xenograft models by oral administration of 10 mg/kg once
a day, and observed TGI of 106 and 87%, respectively (Fig

Growth suppressive effect of OTSSP167 in
various cancer types
Since MELK was reported to be overexpressed
in other types of human cancer in addition to breast
cancer[9, 10], we examined the growth inhibitory effect
of OTSSP167 on the growth of various cancer cell lines.
In vitro anti-proliferative assay using A549 (lung), T47D
(breast), DU4475 (breast), and 22Rv1 (prostate) cancer
cells, in which MELK was highly expressed, revealed IC50
values of 6.7, 4.3, 2.3, and 6.0 nM, respectively (Fig 2AD). On the other hand, HT1197 (bladder) cancer cells, in
which MELK expression was hardly detectable, revealed
IC50 value of 97 nM (Fig 2E), clearly implying the MELKdependent growth-inhibition effect of this compound.

High-through put screening to identify MELKspecific inhibitor
To obtain small-molecule MELK inhibitors, we
first conducted high-throughput screening of a library
consisting of 108,269 compounds. Each compound was
screened at a single concentration of 30 μM against
MELK using the IMAP assay[19] optimized for the highthroughput low-volume 384-well format assays (see
Supplementary Methods). The inhibition activity was
measured by percent of inhibition of the MELK kinase
activity relative to control. The average and standard
deviation of the percent inhibition were 0.87% and
9.07%, respectively. A total of 597 compounds revealed
the MELK kinase inhibitory activity by 37.1% or higher.
After validation by dose-response analysis, a quinoline
derivative (compound 1 in Fig 1A) was confirmed to
inhibit the MELK activity with the half-maximum
inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 4.8 μM. To develop
high-affinity MELK inhibitors, we performed an intensive
structure-activity relationship study on the basis of the
structure of compound 1, and obtained novel compounds
with various degrees of MELK inhibitory activity. Among
them, the compound OTSSP167 (Fig 1B) was identified
as one of the most effective MELK inhibitor with IC50

3E and F). To further validate the MELK-specific in vivo
tumor suppressive effect, we examined PC-14 lung cancer
cells in which MELK expression was hardly detectable
(Fig 3G). Oral administration of 10 mg/kg OTSSP167
once a day for 14 days showed no tumor growth
suppressive effect on PC-14 xenografts (Fig 3H), further
supporting the MELK-dependent antitumor activity of
OTSSP167.

DBNL is known to be an actin-binding adaptor
protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and
endocytosis[20-22]. To characterize the biological
function of DBNL in human cancer, we first examined
in vivo phosphorylation status of DBNL by western blot
analysis using BT549 cells treated with Okadaic acid that
can inhibit the phosphatase activity[23]. We introduced
either or both of MELK and DBNL expression vectors
into the cells, and detected the significant elevation of
DBNL phosphorylation in the cells trasnfected with both
expression vectors, compared with the cells transfected
with either of the genes or the mock vector (Fig 5A). In
addition, to identify the phosphorylation sites of DBNL
by MELK, we performed mass spectrometry analysis
in the presence or absence of MELK, and identified
and confirmed Ser269 as a candidate phophorlylation
site as shown in Fig 5B; the substitution of Ser269
of DBNL with an alanine completely diminished the
phosphorylation by MELK, while that of Thr270 with an
alanine showed no effect on the phosphorylation status.
Subsequently, immunocytochemical analysis revealed
drastic enhancement of membrane ruffling of the cells that
were co-transfected with both DBNL and MELK (Fig 5C).
Since membrane ruffling is related to tumor cell mobility
and cancer metastasis[24], we performed Matrigel
invasion assay (Fig 5D) and observed significantly higher
invasiveness of the cells overexpressing both DBNL and
MELK than the control cells or those overexpressing
either of the two genes.

OTSSP167 inhibits the phosphorylation of novel
MELK substrates
To further characterize the molecular mechanism of
MELK overexpression in mammary carcinogenesis and
validate the functional consequence of small molecule
inhibitor against MELK, we further investigated MELK
substrates. Using the MELK recombinant protein, we
performed in vitro kinase assay in combination with
2D-PAGE and identified multiple candidate spots which
appeared in a MELK-specific manner. We analyzed these
spots by mass spectrometry and confirmed drebrin-like
(DBNL) and proteasome subunit alpha type 1 (PSMA1)
to be MELK substrates by in vitro kinase assay using
their recombinant proteins as shown in Fig 4A. We
subsequently performed in vitro kinase assay with these
two substrates to confirm the phosphorylation-inhibitory
effect of OTSSP167. As shown in Fig 4B, addition of
this compound in an in vitro kinase assay significantly
suppressed the phosphorylation levels of DBNL and
PSMA1, further supporting strong inhibitory effect of this
compound on the MELK activity.

through the high-throughput screening. The subsequent structure-activity relationship study led to the synthesis of a highly potent MELK

OTSSP167 suppresses mammosphere formation
through the inhibition of PSMA1 phosphorylation

expression that is well known as one of the stem cell
markers while that of kinase-dead MELK (D150A)
did not. Moreover, in mammosphere formation assay
using MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the cells that were
treated with OTSSP167 revealed stronger inhibition
in its mammosphere formation than in the growth of
adherent cells (Fig 6D), suggesting that OTSSP167 is
likely to suppress effectively the growth of cancer stem
cells. Interestingly, overexpression of PSMA1 was
reported to play critical roles in hematopoietic stem
progenitor cells[26]. Hence, we investigated possible
involvement of PSMA1 phosphorylation by MELK in
the maintenance of cancer stem cell characteristics. We
performed mammosphere formation assay using MCF7 cells which transiently over-expressed PSMA1 with
either wild-type MELK or kinase-dead MELK, and found
co-overexpression of PSMA1 and wild-type MELK
strongly enhanced sphere formation, compared with the
parental MCF-7 cells or those transfected with PSMA1
or PSMA1+ kinase-dead MELK (Fig 6E). Concordantly,
the depletion of PSMA1 or MELK expression in MDAMB-231 cells using siRNA significantly suppressed the
formation of mammosphere (Fig 6F). Taken together,
these results suggest that OTSSP167 suppressed
mammosphere formation of cancer stem cells through the
reduction of phosphorylated PSMA1 by inhibition of the
MELK activity.

PSMA1 is a subunit of the proteasome complex
and was reported to be upregulated in breast cancer
cells[25]. To examine the biological effect of MELK
on PSMA1, we trasnfected either or both of MELK and
PSMA1 into BT549 cells, and found the increase of the
PSMA1 protein when PSMA1 was co-transfected with
MELK, compared with the cells transfected with PSMA1
alone (Fig 6A). In concordance with this result, when
we knocked-down MELK in T47D cells using siRNA,
the amount of PSMA1 protein was drastically reduced,
compared with the parental cells or the cells treated with
control siRNA (Fig 6A), while the amount of PSMA1
transcript was unchanged (Fig 6B). These results have
indicated that MELK possibly stabilizes PSMA1 protein
through its phosphorylation. Since the knockdown of
PSMA1 expression suppressed the proliferation of cancer
cells (data not shown), the PSMA1 is also considered
to be essential for survival of cancer cells. Previous
studies suggested contribution of MELK in cancer stem
cells due to its high level of expression in cancer stem
cell populations (ex, CD133-positive glioblastoma cells)
[10, 12, 13]. Our results in Fig 6C also revealed that
upregulation of MELK promoted the mammosphere
formation of breast cancer cells and induced the Otc3/4

DISCUSSION

cancers without no or a little body-weight loss at the
effective doses. The experiment using the MELK-negative
cancer cells supported the MELK-dependent growth
suppressive effect of OTSSP167 on cancer cells.
In parallel, to further characterize biological
mechanisms of the MELK-signaling pathway and verify
the mode of action of the MELK inhibitor OTSSP167,
we screened novel MELK substrates and identified two
possible candidate molecules, DBNL and PSMA1. DBNL
is a member of the debrin/Abp1 family of actin-binding
proteins and is a component of the immunological synapse
that regulates T-cell activation[34]. Although there was no
evidence of DNBL involvement in human carcinogenesis,
our data have indicated that the phosphorylation of
DBNL by MELK is likely to promote cancer cell
invasiveness, and probably lead to tumor recurrence and
poor prognosis[35]. We also found that MELK could
phosphorylate Ser269 on DBNL. Since the phosphrylation
of this site was reported to be critical to bind to 14-3-3
proteins[36] that has important roles in the regulation
of numerous cellular signaling pathways like cell cycle
regulation or apoptosis[37], we suspect that MELK might
promote cell growth and mobility of cancer cells through
the regulation of the DBNL-14-3-3 signaling pathway.
The other substrate, PSMA1, is one of the
components of the 20S core structure of proteasome
complex that is important to regulate the concentration
of intracellular proteins and remove misfolded proteins
through degrading them[38]. The function of PSMA1 itself
was not well understood, however, its phosphorylation
might affect the assembly of the proteasome complex[39].
A recent study suggested that enhancement of the
proteasome assembly and activity could play crucial roles
in the maintenance of human embryonic stem cells[40].
We also investigated the biological characteristics of
PSMA1 in cancer cells, and found that PSMA1 was
stabilized by the phosphorylation in MELK overexpressing

After a great success of Imatinib in the treatment
of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), many scientists
and industries have been focusing on the development
of drugs targeting on cancer-specific molecules[27].
Protein kinases are considered as attractive therapeutic
targets for development of anti-cancer drugs because
they play critical roles in growth-signaling pathways
in cancer cells[28-31]. However, development of an
inhibitor(s) which specifically suppresses target kinase
activity is not so easy because most of kinase inhibitors
are type 1 inhibitor which recognizes an ATP-pocket
highly conserved across kinases and competes with ATP.
These structural conservation leads to the unexpected
cross-reactivity, in some cases yielding unexpected and
unfavorable side effects[28, 32]. For discovering new
kinase inhibitors with high effectiveness and minimum
toxicity, the combination of identification of appropriate
target molecules coupled with advanced drug-development
tools including analogue synthesis, structure-informed
design and fragment-based assembly is essential[28, 33].
To develop MELK-specific inhibitors in this
study, we conducted the high-throughput screening for
identification of hit compounds and subsequent intensive
structure-activity informed study, and finally developed
OTSSP167 which effectively inhibited the MELK kinase
activity with IC50 of 0.41 nM. We then investigated the
effect of OTSSP167 on the formation of mammosphere,
one of the characteristics of breast cancer stem cells since
MELK was reported as a key molecule for cancer stemcell formation/maintenance[13]. Our results showed
that OTSSP167 inhibited mammosphere formation in a
dose-dependent manner and also revealed strong growthsuppressive effect on various types of human cancer
xenograft including breast, pancreas, prostate and lung

selective MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 could suppress the
phosphorylation of these two MELK substrates, and has
the in vitro and in vivo growth suppressive effect on cancer
cells, implicating a great potential of this MELK inhibitor
to apply to treatment of various types of human cancer.

cells and that coexistence of PSMA1 and MELK enhanced
the formation of mammosphere. Interestingly, the number
of mammosphere was significantly decreased in the cells
in which PSMA1 expression was knocked down by siRNA
for PSMA1. Our data imply that OTSSP167 possibly
suppressed mammosphere formation through the reduction
of PSMA1 protein.
In summary, we have demonstrated that MELK
plays crucial roles in cancer progression and/or stem cell

much stronger than that in the cells in which only DBNL was transfected. (B) Identification of phosphorylated sites by in vitro kinase assay.
Amino acid substituted mutants of DBNL were generated and used for in vitro kinase assay. Phosphorylated band of DBNL in which a serine
269 was substituted with an alanine (S269A) was completely diminished, while that of DBNL in which a threonine 270 was substituted
with an alanine (T270A) was unchanged. wt; wild-type. Closed arrows indicate phosphorylated DBNL. (C) Immunocytochemical analysis
of cells overexpressing DBNL with/without MELK. MCF-7 cells in which both MELK and DBNL were over-expressed shows a strongly
enhanced membrane-ruffling pattern (Red; DBNL, Green; MELK, Blue; DAPI) which is indicated by white arrow. (D) MCF-7 cells
over-expressing DBNL revealed elevated cell invasiveness in the presence of MELK. The number of invaded cells on Y-axis indicates
the average cell number of migration, that was counted by microscopic observation (*p=0.009, **p=0.0209, student’s t-test). Error bars

Figure 6: PSMA1 enhanced the mammosphere formation through the phosphorylation by MELK. (A, B) PSMA1

protein was stabilized through the phosphorylation by MELK in breast cancer cells (A) although transcriptional level of PSMA1 was
unchanged in the cells in which MELK expression was knocked down (B). (C) Wild-type MELK (MELK-wt) or kinase-dead mutant
MELK (MELK-150A) expression vector was transfected into MCF-7 cells which were seeded onto an ultra-low attachment culture plate.
The formation of mammosphere was enhanced in cells in which MELK-wt was transiently introduced than those transfected with mock
vector or MELK-150A. The expression levels of one of cancer stem cell markers, Oct3/4, are shown. The cells which transiently overexpressed MELK-wt induced Oct3/4 expression while those transfected with mock vector or MELK-150A revealed no Oct3/4 expression.
(D) OTSSP167 suppressed more significantly the formation of mammosphere than the growth of attached MCF-7 cells. The cells were
plated onto ultra-low attachment culture plate or normal culture plate without or with OTSSP167 of given concentrations (*p<0.05,
student’s t-test). (E) The MCF-7 cells in which both PSMA1 and wild-type MELK (MELK wt) were co-overexpressed revealed higher
number of mammosphere formation than the parental MCF-7 cells or those transfected with PSMA1 alone or PSMA1 + kinase-dead MELK
(MELK D150A) (*p<0.0001, student’s t-test). (F) The mammosphere formation of MDA-MB-231 cells, in which PSMA1 was knocked
down, was suppressed (**p<0.05, student’s t-test). Absorbance measured at 490 nm is indicated using that at 630 nm as a reference with
a microplate reader. Error bars represent means ± SD of triplicates for experiments D-F.

MELK wild-type and kinase-dead mutant (D150A)
plasmids were constructed previously[9]. To construct
vectors designed to express DBNL (NM_001014436.2)
or PSMA1 (NM_002786.3), the entire coding
sequences were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into
the pcDNA3.1-myc-his or pCAGGSnHc expression
vector. We carried out site-directed mutagenesis PCR
to generate DBNL substituted mutants (S269A and
T270A) with a QuickChange site-directed Mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were transfected using
Fugene6 (for NIH3T3) or FugeneHD (for human breast
cancer cell lines) (Roche) according to the supplier’s
recommendations. For knockdown experiments, cells
were transfected with oligo siRNA using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The target sequences of oligo siRNAs
were as follows: 5’-GACAUCCUAUCUAGCUGCA-3’
for MELK; 5’-CAGAUACCAACACAACGAU-3’ for
PSMA1; 5’-GGTGCTGGCTCTGAGCACA-3’ for
DBNL; 5′-TTGAAGCAGCACGACUUCUUC-3′ and
5′-TTGAAGAAGUCGUGCUGCUUC-3′ for siEGFP.

partial recombinant MELK protein (264-601 amino acids
of MELK) as an immunogen by the methods as described
previously[41]. For immunocytochemistry, MCF-7 cells
were seeded onto glass slide-chamber and transfected with
expression vector(s) as described above. After 48 hours
of incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for
1 min at room temperature. Non-specific binding was
blocked by treatment with PBS containing 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature.
Cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature
with anti-HA or anti-DBNL antibody diluted at 1:200
by PBS containing 3% BSA. After washing with PBS,
cells were stained by Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary
antibody (Invitrogen) for 60 min at room temperature,
and visualized with Spectral Confocal Scanning Systems
(Leica).
In vivo phosphorylation assay
DBNL expression vector was transfected into cells
with or without MELK expression vector. After 48 hours
of incubation, cells were treated with 100 nM Okadaic
acid (Calbiochem) and incubated for 6 hours. The cells
were lysed after the treatment with Okadaic acid and the
lysed samples were loaded into 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The
proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane
(GE Healthcare). The membrane was incubated with antiDBNL antibody (Abnova) or anti-β-actin (ACTB) (SigmaAldrich). ACTB served as a loading control.

Recombinant proteins and in vitro kinase assay for
substrate screening
MELK recombinant protein was generated as
described previously[9]. The full coding sequence of each
of MELK substrate candidates was amplified by RT-PCR
and cloned into the pGEX6p-1 vector (GE Healthcare).
The GST-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed
in BL21 codon-plus RIL competent cells (Stratagene)
and purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE
Healthcare) according to the supplier’s instructions.
The GST-tag was removed by PreScission protease (GE
Healthcare) according to the supplier’s instructions. For
in vitro kinase assay, MELK recombinant protein (0.4 μg)
was mixed with 5 μg of each substrate in 20 μl of kinase
buffer containing 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH), 10 mM DTT,
40 mM NaF, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA with 50 μM
cold-ATP and 10 Ci of [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare) for 30
min at 30 oC. The reaction was terminated by addition of
SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to SDSPAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed with
intensifying screens at room temperature. OTSSP167
(final concentration of 10 nM) was dissolved in DMSO
and added to kinase buffer before the incubation.

Matrigel invasion assay and mammosphere formation
assay
NIH3T3 cells transfected with plasmids expressing
MELK (pCAGGSnHc-MELK), DBNL (pcDNA3.1-MycHis-DBNL) or both were grown to near confluence in
DMEM containing 10% FBS. After the incubation of 24
hours, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed
in DMEM without addition of serum, and suspended in
serum-free DMEM. The cells (1x104 cells) were seeded
onto the Matrigel matrix chamber (BD Biosciences) and
incubated for 22 hours.The cells invading to Matrigel
were stained by Giemsa (Merck) and counted. For sphere
formation assay, 1x103 cells of MCF-7 cells which
transiently over-expressed wild-type MELK, kinase-dead
MELK, PMSA1, PSMA1 and wild-type MELK, or PMSA
and kinase-dead MELK were seeded onto Ultra-Low
attachment plate (Corning). For knockdown experiments,
MDA-MB-231 cells (1x103 cells) which seeded onto
Ultra-Low attachment plate were transfected with oligo
siRNA for EGFP, MELK or PSMA1 as described above.
For examination of sphere formation under treatment
of MELK inhibitor OTSSP167, 1x103 MCF-7 cells
were seeded with 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, or 0.16 μM of
OTSSP167, respectively. DMSO alone was used as a
control. Following incubation for two weeks, cell viability
was measured by using Cell-counting kit-8 (DOJINDO).

Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing
protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Calbiochem). The proteins were separated by
electrophoresis using 10% or 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes
were incubated with the first antibody, respectively: antiPSMA1 antibody (Epitomics), anti-DBNL antibody, antiMyc (Santa Cruz Biothechnology), anti-HA (Roche), antiOct3/4 (Santa Cruz Biothechnology) or anti-ACTB. We
generated mouse anti-MELK monoclonal antibodies using

Author contributions

In vivo xenograft study
MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the
mammary fat pads of NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice
(Charles River Laboratory). A549, MIAPaCa-2 and PC14 cells (1 x 107 cells) were injected subcutaneously in the
left flank of female BALB/cSLC-nu/nu mice (Japan SLC,
Inc.). DU145 cells were injected subcutaneously in the
left flank of male BALB/cSLC-nu/nu mice (Japan SLC,
Inc.). When MDA-MB-231, A549, DU145, MIAPaCa-2,
and PC-14 xenografts had reached an average volume of
100, 210, 110, 250, and 250 mm3, respectively, animals
were randomized into groups of 6 mice (except for PC14, for which groups of 3 mice were used). For oral
administration, compounds were prepared in a vehicle
of 0.5% methylcellulose and given by oral garbage
at the indicated dose and schedule. For intravenous
administration, compounds were formulated in 5%
glucose and injected into the tail vein. An administration
volume of 10 ml per kg of body weight was used for both
administration routes. Concentrations were indicated in
main text and Figures. Tumor volumes were determined
every other day using a caliper. The results were converted
to tumor volume (mm3) by the formula length x width2
x 1/2. The weight of the mice was determined as an
indicator of tolerability on the same days. The animal
experiments using A549 xenografts were conducted by
contract with KAC Co., Ltd. (Shiga, Japan) in accordance
with their Institutional Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. The other animal experiments were
conducted at OncoTherapy Science, Inc. in accordance
with their Institutional Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was
calculated according to the formula {1 – (T – T0) / (C –
C0)}×100, where T and T0 are the mean tumor volumes at
day 14 and day 0, respectively, for the experimental group,
and C – C0 are those for the vehicle control group.
