Incidence in a Large United States Cohort

Abstract
HMG-coA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, account for the great majority of cholesterollowering drug use. However, little is known about the association between long-term statin use and incidence of
most types of cancers. We examined the association between long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs,
predominantly statins, and the incidence of ten common cancers, as well as overall cancer incidence, among
133,255 participants (60,059 men and 73,196 women) in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort during
the period from 1997 to 2007. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks
(RR). Current use status and duration of use were updated during follow-up using information from biennial
follow-up questionnaires. Current use of cholesterol-lowering drugs for five or more years was not associated with
overall cancer incidence (RR ¼ 0.97, 95% CI ¼ 0.92–1.03), or incidence of prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, bladder,
renal cell, or pancreatic cancer but was associated with lower risk of melanoma (RR ¼ 0.79, 95% CI ¼ 0.66–0.96),
endometrial cancer (RR ¼ 0.65, 95% CI ¼ 0.45–0.94), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; RR ¼ 0.74, 95% CI ¼ 0.62–
0.89). These results suggest that long-term use of statins is unlikely to substantially increase or decrease overall
cancer risk. However, associations between long-term statin use and risk of endometrial cancer, melanoma, and
NHL deserve further investigation. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1763–71. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
HMG-coA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, were introduced in the United States in 1987 and rapidly
became the most commonly used type of cholesterol-lowering
medication (1, 2). By 1997, statins accounted for approximately 86% of cholesterol-lowering drug use in the United
States (2). Statins are used by an estimated 24 million adults in
the United States alone (3) and are proven to reduce risk of
cardiovascular disease (4). Because statins are often used
indefinitely, the prevalence of long-term use is likely to
increase over time. It has been hypothesized that statin use
could reduce risk of certain cancers given that they inhibit
carcinogenesis in a variety of rodent models (5) and have some
anti-inflammatory effects in humans (6–8). However, it should
also be noted that for many types of cancer, adverse effects of
long-term statin use cannot be ruled out on the basis of
currently available evidence.
A meta-analysis of data from randomized trials designed to
examine cardiovascular outcomes found no association
between statin use and overall cancer incidence or incidence
of colorectal, breast, lung, or prostate cancer (9). However,

these trials are not well suited to address the potential effects
of long-term use on cancer incidence because of relatively
short intervention and follow-up periods. Observational studies that examined associations between long-term use (typically defined as more than 4 or 5 years) and cancer incidence
generally do not support associations with the incidence of
breast, colorectal, or overall prostate cancer (10). However,
very few studies have examined associations between longterm use and incidence of other cancers.
The most comprehensive study of long-term statin use and
cancer to date is an analysis of computerized pharmacy data
from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in northern California that examined risk of more than 25 types of
cancers (11). Among women, there were no associations
between 5 years or more of statin use and incidence of any
type of cancer. Among men, 5 years or more of statin use was
associated with slightly higher overall cancer incidence (RR ¼
1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17), due in part to a statistically significant
increase in bladder cancer incidence. Limitations of the Kaiser
Permanente analysis included the absence of information on
potential confounders, including smoking and obesity, and
limited statistical power for less common cancers. In addition,
most statin prescriptions in the Kaiser Permanente analysis
were for lovastatin, the earliest commercially available statin,
which was largely replaced in the United States by more
potent statins in the mid-1990s (2).
We examined the association between long-term use of
cholesterol-lowering drugs and incidence of 10 common
cancers among participants in the Cancer Prevention
Study-II (CPS-II) Nutrition Cohort. The CPS-II Nutrition
Cohort is well-suited to examine this association due to a

relatively high prevalence of long-term use, regularly updated
information on use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, and detailed
information on many potential confounders.

Materials and Methods
Study cohort
Men (n ¼ 60,059) and women (n ¼ 73,196) in this analysis
were participants in the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective
study of cancer incidence in the United States established in
1992 and described in detail elsewhere (12). The Emory
University Institutional Review Board approves all aspects
of the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort. At enrollment in 1992 or 1993,
participants completed a mailed self-administered questionnaire including information on demographic, medical, and
lifestyle factors. Follow-up questionnaires to update exposure
information and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers were
sent in 1997 and every 2 years thereafter. The response rate for
each follow-up questionnaire was at least 88%.
Follow-up for this analysis began on the date of completion
of the 1997 questionnaire, rather than at enrollment into the
cohort in 1992 or 1993, because data from retail pharmacies in
the United States indicate that statins accounted for approximately 86% of cholesterol-lowering drug use in 1997, compared
with 62% in 1992 (2). A total of 65,047 men and 78,747 women
from the Nutrition Cohort completed the standard version of
the 1997 questionnaire, which included questions on use of
cholesterol-lowering drugs. All analyses excluded participants
who provided incomplete or uninterpretable information on
use of cholesterol-lowering drugs (n ¼ 3,759), smoking status
(n ¼ 2,824), or who were lost to follow-up because they did not
return any of the follow-up questionnaires (n ¼ 3,956). For
analyses of each cancer, participants with a history of that type
of cancer were excluded. Analyses of endometrial cancer
excluded an additional 28,943 women who had had a hysterectomy at baseline and also censored women who subsequently reported a hysterectomy.
Ascertainment of cancer cases
Of the 15,839 first cancers included in this analysis, 13,497
were initially identified by self-report on the follow-up questionnaires and were subsequently verified by obtaining medical records or through linkage with state cancer registries
when complete medical records could not be obtained (12).
Ascertainment of cancer by self-report is estimated to have a
sensitivity of 93% in the Nutrition Cohort (13). An additional
2,342 cases of cancer were identified through linkage with the
National Death Index (14), of which 1,875 were verified
through subsequent linkage with state cancer registries. Analyses of specific cancer sites also included some cases that
were the first occurrence of cancer at that site, but were not
first cancers. Analyses did not include in situ prostate, colorectal, and cervical cancers, but it did include in situ cancers at
other sites.
Assessment of use of cholesterol-lowering drugs
The 1997 questionnaire asked participants to report
whether they had taken any "cholesterol-lowering drugs"

1764

regularly during the past year, and provided as examples
the brand names for 4 statins commonly used at that time
(lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin; ref. 2), as
well as the brand names for the fibrate drug, gemfibrozil, and
the bile-acid binding resin, cholestyramine. Although this
question did not distinguish between statins and nonstatin
cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins accounted for approximately 86% of cholesterol-lowering drug use in the United
States by 1997 (2) The 1999, 2001, and 2003 follow-up questionnaires included a similar question about use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. A more detailed question about type and
dose of cholesterol-lowering drug was included on the 2005
questionnaire. In 2005, 93% of all users of cholesterol-lowering
drugs reported using a statin. Information on use of cholesterol-lowering drugs before the start of follow-up for this
analysis was available from the 1992 questionnaire, which
included a question similar to that on the 1997 questionnaire.
We considered use of cholesterol-lowering drugs to be a
reasonable surrogate measure for use of statins because,
during the study time period, statins accounted for the great
majority of cholesterol-lowering drug use.
Statistical analysis
Use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was categorized as never,
former, or current, using a time-dependent variable initially
defined by use in 1997 and updated by use reported in 1999,
2001, 2003, and 2005. Use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was
relatively consistent over time. Among participants with
complete data on use of cholesterol-lowering drugs in both
1997 and 1999, 91% of current users in 1997 reported current
use in 1999, and 90% of never users in 1997 reported no use in
1999. Therefore, if a participant did not provide information
on use of cholesterol-lowering drugs on a follow-up questionnaire, they retained the same status (never, former, or
current use) reported on the immediately preceding questionnaire approximately 2 years earlier. Participants who did
not provide information on use of cholesterol-lowering drugs
on 2 consecutive questionnaires were censored from further
follow-up. Current users were further categorized as having
less than 5 years of use and 5 or more years of use, based on
use reported on previous questionnaires. Specifically, participants were categorized as current users of 5 or more years
during the 1997–1999 follow-up interval if they reported
current use in both 1992 and 1997; during the 1999–2001
follow-up interval if they reported current use in 1992, 1997,
and 1999; and during subsequent follow-up intervals if they
reported current use on the 3 immediately preceding questionnaires (e.g., reported current use in 1997, 1999, and 2001
for the 2001–2003 follow-up interval).
Cox proportional hazards regression models (15) were used
to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for incident cancer. Follow-up time for Cox models began
on the date of completion of the 1997 questionnaire. All
models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, smoking
status, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID,
including aspirin) in 1992, use of NSAIDs in 1997, body mass
index (BMI), physical activity, and history of elevated cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Models for

prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer were also adjusted for
history of PSA testing, history of mammography, and history
of colorectal endoscopy, respectively, using time-dependent
variables and updated information from follow-up questionnaires. History of PSA testing was categorized as never, in the
last 2 years, more than 2 years ago, or unknown. Those that
reported having PSA testing in the last 2 years were further
categorized on indication for PSA testing (routine or for
symptoms). History of mammography was categorized as
never, in the last 2 years, more than 2 years ago, or unknown.
History of colorectal endoscopy was categorized as never or
ever. Models including women were also adjusted for hormone therapy use categorized as never, current estrogen,
former estrogen, current estrogen and progesterone, former
estrogen and progesterone, or unknown or other type. Age was
adjusted for using the stratified Cox procedure (16) with one
year strata. Unless otherwise noted previously, all covariates
were based on status in 1997 and were modeled using the
categories shown in Table 1. Further adjustment for alcohol
use and geographic region had negligible effects on results and
these factors were not included in final models.
Cross-product terms between long-term use of cholesterollowering drugs and follow-up time (continuous) were modeled to examine whether the association between long-term
use and incidence of each cancer varied by follow-up time.
Multiplicative interaction terms between long-term use and
continuous variables for attained age and BMI, and categorical
variables for sex, smoking status (never, current, or former),
NSAID use (< 15, or  15 pills per month in 1997), and history
of other cancer were also modeled. Because this analysis
includes a considerable number of different cancer outcomes,
these interactions were considered noteworthy only if P < 0.01.
All P values are 2-sided.

Results
Participants in this analysis were predominantly white
and over age 60 at baseline, regardless of use of cholesterollowering drugs (Table 1). Among women, current long-term
users of cholesterol-lowering drugs (hereafter referred to
simply as long-term users) were more likely than never users
to have a lower level of education. Among men, long-term
users were more likely than never users to be former
smokers. Nearly all long-term users reported having been
told by a physician that they had elevated cholesterol,
although many never users also had a history of elevated
cholesterol. Long-term users were more likely than never
users to be overweight or obese, to have a history of diabetes,
heart disease, or hypertension, and to take at least 30 NSAID
pills a month, likely reflecting daily use of aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular disease. At baseline in 1997,
approximately 20.8% of men and 15.2% of women included
in this analysis reported current use of cholesterol-lowering
drugs. By 2005, this prevalence had increased to approximately 52.9% among men and 40.3% among women.
Long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was not associated with overall cancer incidence or with risk of prostate,
breast, colorectal, lung, bladder, pancreatic, or renal cell

cancer but was associated with statistically significantly lower
risks of melanoma (P ¼ 0.02), endometrial cancer (P ¼ 0.02),
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P < 0.001; Table 2). Shorter-term
use of cholesterol-lowering drugs also was associated with
lower risk of NHL. Results for NHL shown in Table 2 are based
on a broad definition of NHL recently recommended for
epidemiologic research by the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (17). This definition includes lymphocytic leukemias, multiple myeloma, and plasma cell tumors
other than multiple myeloma. Using a narrower definition of
NHL that does not include these cancers, the RR associated
with long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was 0.76
(95% CI 0.62–0.93). Because statin use has been reported to be
associated with lower risk of advanced prostate cancer in
several studies (10), including a previous analysis of the CPS-II
Nutrition Cohort (18), we examined results specifically for
advanced prostate cancer (stage III or IV (19)). Long-term use
of cholesterol-lowering drugs was not associated with a
statistically significant reduction in risk of advanced prostate
cancer.
No notable interactions between long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and potential effect modifiers (follow-up
time, attained age, BMI, smoking status, NSAID use, or history
of other cancer) were observed in analyses of any of the cancer
outcomes examined.
Results were similar in analyses examining 7 years or more
of cholesterol-lowering drug use, rather than 5 years or more.
Compared with never use, use of cholesterol-lowering drugs
for 7 years or more was not significantly associated with
overall cancer incidence or with risk of prostate, breast,
colorectal, lung, bladder, pancreatic, or renal cell cancer
but was associated with lower risk of melanoma (RR ¼
0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.88), endometrial cancer (RR ¼ 0.53, 95%
CI 0.32–0.87), and NHL (RR ¼ 0.77, 95% CI 0.62–0.94). There
were insufficient numbers to examine longer duration use.
In analyses by NHL subtype, point estimates for RR for longterm use were below 1 for all NHL subtypes except follicular
lymphoma (Table 3).

Discussion
In this large prospective study, long-term use of cholesterollowering drugs, predominantly statins, was not associated
with overall cancer incidence, or with incidence of most
common cancers. However, long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated with lower incidence of melanoma,
endometrial cancer, and NHL.
Our null result with respect to long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and overall cancer incidence is generally consistent with results from an analysis of computerized
pharmacy data from Kaiser Permanente (11), to our knowledge the only previous study of this association. Long-term
statin use was not associated with overall cancer incidence
among women in the Kaiser Permanente analysis but was
associated with a small increase in incidence among men
(RR ¼ 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17). It is possible that the higher
overall cancer incidence observed among men in that study
was due to confounding by smoking. RR for 4 common

Externally adjusted results for overall cancer incidence were
not reported.
Our null results with respect to long-term use and risk of
prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer are consistent with
results from most previous studies of long-term use of statins.
Of studies that included at least 20 cases of breast (11, 21–24),
prostate (11, 18, 24–28), or colorectal cancer (11, 29–32), with 4
or more years of use, only 2 (26, 29) reported a statistically
significant reduction in risk.
Few previous studies examined the association between
long-term statin use and risk of bladder, renal cell, pancreatic, or lung cancer. For bladder cancer, our null results for
long-term use differ from those of the Kaiser Permanente
analysis (11), the only previous study of this association,
which showed a statistically significantly higher risk for men,
and a similar, though not statistically significantly, higher
risk for women. Our null results for long-term use and risk of
renal cell, pancreatic, and lung cancer are consistent with
results from the Kaiser Permanente analysis. However, use of
statins for more than 4 years was associated with a highly
statistically significant and approximately 80% reduced risk
of both pancreatic and lung cancer in analyses of a large
Veteran's Administration database (33, 34). However, the
reduced risk associated with long-term use observed in these
analyses is difficult to interpret and may have been largely an
artifact of differential classification of exposure. Duration of
use for cases was based on prescriptions received between
1998 and diagnosis date (between 1998 and 2004), whereas
duration of use for controls appears to have been based
on all prescriptions received during the 1998–2004 study
period.
Long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated
with lower risk of endometrial cancer and melanoma in our
study. These results should be interpreted cautiously as
epidemiologic support for an association between statin

www.aacrjournals.org

use and these cancers is limited. With respect to endometrial
cancer, statin use was associated with lower risk of endometrial cancer in one study (35), but not in 4 other studies (11, 24,
36, 37), including the Kaiser Permanente analysis (11), the only
previous study to examine long-term use. With respect to
melanoma, use of higher doses of statins was associated with
lower risk in an analysis of a Veteran's Administration pharmacy database (38). However, no association was observed in
an analysis of a large English pharmacy database (39) or in the
Kaiser Permanente analysis, the only previous study to examine long-term use (11). The lower risk of endometrial cancer
and melanoma associated with long-term use in our study
could be due to chance. Additional studies that specifically
examine long-term use would be useful to confirm or refute
our results.
Use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated with
modestly reduced risk of NHL in our study, consistent with
some (40–42) but not all (11, 24, 43) other studies. The
definition of NHL used in most of these previous studies
did not include lymphocytic leukemias or multiple myeloma,
with the exception of the EPI-LYMPH study, which examined
all lymphoid neoplasms. Ever use of statins was associated
with statistically significantly lower risk of NHL in the 3 largest
(40–42) of the 5 case–control studies published to date (24,
40–43). In the largest of these, a European case–control study
(EPI-LYMPH) including 2,362 cases, odds ratio for lymphoma
were 0.6 (95% CI 0.5–0.8) for ever use and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3–1.2)
for long-term use ( 6 years; ref. 42). However, ever use of
statins was not associated with NHL in a smaller United States
case–control study (24) and was associated with higher risk of
NHL in a Japanese case–control study (43). In the Kaiser
Permanente analysis, the only other prospective analysis, risk
of NHL was not associated with either short-term use or longterm use (for long-term use, RR ¼ 1.0, 95% CI 0.7–1.5 in men
based on 32 cases in long-term users, RR ¼ 1.2, 95% CI 0.8–1.8
in women, 25 cases in long-term users; ref. 11). Reasons for
these differing results are not clear.
Our analyses by subtype of NHL were limited by small
numbers. However, evidence of an association between longterm use and lower risk appeared strongest for diffuse large

Small lymphocytic leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and marginal zone lymphomas,
whereas there was no suggestion of lower risk for follicular
lymphoma. It is possible that the anti-inflammatory effects
of statins (6, 7) could be more relevant for DLBCL and
marginal zone lymphoma than for follicular lymphoma. Both
systemic autoimmune diseases and an established inflammation-related polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) gene are more strongly associated with DLBCL and
marginal zone lymphoma than with follicular lymphoma
(44–46).
The suggestion of an association between long-term use of
cholesterol-lowering drugs and lower risk of multiple myeloma in our study (RR ¼ 0.7, 95% CI 0.5–1.1) is consistent with
results of previous studies. Ever use of statins was associated
with significantly lower risk of multiple myeloma in a Connecticut case–control study (OR ¼ 0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.8; ref 47)
and the EPI-LYMPH study (OR ¼ 0.5, 95% CI 0.2–1.0; ref. 42).
Neither of these studies reported results for long-term use. In
the Kaiser Permanente analysis, long-term statin use (5
years) was associated with RR of 0.8 (95% CI 0.4–1.6) among
men and 0.3 (95% CI 0.1–1.2) among women (11).
Possible reasons for the association between use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and lower risk of NHL observed in
our study include chance, reverse causation, and causation.
Chance appears unlikely to entirely explain this association
given the low P value associated with long-term use (P <
0.001) and the fact that inverse associations were observed
in some previous studies of NHL. Reverse causation is a
possibility, as undiagnosed NHL could have lowered
cholesterol levels, reducing the need to initiate cholesterol-lowering therapy, and ultimately resulting in cholesterol-lowering drug use being associated with an apparent
reduction in risk of NHL. The possibility that lymphoma
progression could reduce cholesterol levels is suggested by
results from a large cardiovascular disease trial (48) where
low cholesterol was associated with significantly higher risk

www.aacrjournals.org

of mortality from lymphoid cancers within 5 years of blood
draw but not during later years of follow-up. However, if
undiagnosed lymphoma reduced the need to initiate cholesterol-lowering therapy, any resulting reduction in risk
would be expected to be stronger for short-term use of
cholesterol-lowering drugs (use initiated close to diagnosis)
than for long-term use. In our results, the reduction in risk of
NHL appeared slightly weaker for short-term use than for
long-term use. In addition, risk of NHL remained significantly reduced even for those who had used cholesterollowering drugs for 7 or more years. A causal association
between use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and NHL is
biologically plausible. Statins have been shown to inhibit
lymphoma in mouse models (49–51). Statins also have antiinflammatory effects, demonstrated by substantial reductions in C-reactive protein (a marker of systemic inflammation) at clinically used doses (6–8), that could be relevant
given the role of chronic inflammation in NHL etiology (52).
It should be noted that a 20% to 30% reduction in RR of
NHL would probably not be considered sufficient to influence clinical decisions about statin use for people at average
risk of this cancer. However, a modest reduction in RR of
NHL might be a clinically significant benefit for people at
high risk, such as some individuals with Sj€
ogren's syndrome,
an autoimmune disease which has been associated with a
2- to 18-fold increased risk of developing NHL (45, 53–55). In
addition, a modest reduction in RR of multiple myeloma
might be a clinically significant benefit for people with
monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS),
which is associated with a substantial risk of progression to
multiple myeloma (56). A small case–control study did not
find an association between statin use and progression to
multiple myeloma or related lymphoid malignancies among
MGUS patients but included only 15 cases of multiple
myeloma who had used statins (57). Information on the
association between statin use and risk of NHL remains

quite limited. Additional detailed observational analyses of
statin use and risk of NHL, particularly in people at high risk,
could provide useful further information about the potential
role of statins in prevention of NHL. However, randomized
trials would ultimately be needed to provide definitive
results.
Strengths of this study include its prospective design and
relatively large size. Our study included approximately twice
as many cases of cancer with long-term exposure to cholesterol-lowering drugs as the only previous analysis to comprehensively examine the association between long-term use of
cholesterol-lowering drugs and cancer risk (11). In addition,
unlike most previous prospective analyses, we were able to
adjust results for many potentially important confounders,
including history of comorbidities, smoking, and obesity,
although information on these factors was self-reported.
Limitations of this study include the fact that use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was self-reported and was used as a
surrogate measure for use of statins. If use of cholesterollowering drugs other than statins is not associated with risk of
the cancers examined, our results may underestimate associations with statin use. For example, if long-term statin use
was associated with a 20% lower risk of a cancer, but only 90%

of long-term users of cholesterol-lowering drugs in this analysis were truly long-term statin users, we would have
observed only an 18% lower risk of that cancer (0.2 multiplied
by 0.9). Finally, we were unable to examine if risk varied by
drug type or dose.
Results from this large prospective study suggest that longterm statin use does not increase risk of common cancers,
providing some reassurance about the safety of long-term
statin use with respect to cancer. The observed associations
between long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and
lower risk of NHL, endometrial cancer, and melanoma require
replication, ideally from large prospective studies with
detailed information on drug type, duration, and dose.
