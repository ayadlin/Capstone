ABSTRACT
The activity of the M isoform of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor
(MITF-M) has been attributed to regulation of differentiation, proliferation, survival
and senescence of melanoma cells. MITF expression was shown to be antagonized by
the activation of transcription factor NF-κB. Parthenolide, an inhibitor of NF-κB, has
not been yet reported to affect MITF-M expression. Our results obtained in patientderived melanoma cell populations indicate that parthenolide efficiently decreases
the MITF-M level. This is neither dependent on p65/NF-κB signaling nor RAF/MEK/
ERK pathway activity as inhibition of MEK by GSK1120212 (trametinib) and induction
of ERK1/2 activity by parthenolide itself do not interfere with parthenolide-triggered
depletion of MITF-M in both wild-type BRAF and BRAFV600E melanoma populations.
Parthenolide activity is not prevented by inhibitors of caspases, proteasomal and
lysosomal pathways. As parthenolide reduces MITF-M transcript level and HDAC1
protein level, parthenolide-activated depletion of MITF-M protein may be considered
as a result of transcriptional regulation, however, the influence of parthenolide on
other elements of a dynamic control over MITF-M cannot be ruled out. Parthenolide
induces diverse effects in melanoma cells, from death to senescence. The mode of
the response to parthenolide is bound to the molecular characteristics of melanoma
cells, particularly to the basal MITF-M expression level but other cell-autonomous
differences such as NF-κB activity and MCL-1 level might also contribute. Our data
suggest that parthenolide can be developed as a drug used in combination therapy
against melanoma when simultaneous inhibition of MITF-M, NF-κB and HDAC1 is
needed.

MITF is listed among attractive therapeutic oncotargets
[3, 7]. MITF-M is a melanocyte-specific master regulator
that has a critical role in the pathogenesis of melanoma and
hyperpigmented disorders [8–12]. MITF-M regulation is
complex and the exact mechanisms that determine MITF
expression and activity remain incompletely understood
[12–14]. MITF’s contribution to phenotypic heterogeneity
and plasticity of melanoma is considered as an important
part of reduced sensitivity to the BRAF/MEK/ERK
pathway inhibition [2, 7, 15].

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer.
Although immunotherapies and selective inhibitors of
the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway have improved outcomes
for patients with advanced melanoma, the majority of
melanomas either are intrinsically resistant or develop
resistance after initial response [1–3]. This provides a strong
rationale for combination therapies [2, 4]. To improve
the current understanding of melanoma cell response to
therapies, diverse studies have been initiated to analyze
the genetic landscape determining an effective clinical
response [2, 5, 6]. Novel therapies are in development and

in various cancers [16], remaining normal cells unaffected
[17, 18]. Interestingly, PN shows activity against cancer
stem-like cells [16, 18–21], and acts as a chemopreventive
agent in a UVB-induced skin cancer model [22]. The major
activity of PN is to inactivate specific proteins by forming
a covalent bond between α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety
of PN and sulfhydryl groups within proteins [23], and to
increase intracellular concentrations of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) [17, 24]. PN was first identified as nuclear
factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitor [23] that can directly inhibit
the p65 subunit [25], and it is still used as NF-κB inhibitor
in a variety of studies [26, 27]. PN can also interfere with
AP-1 [28] and STAT signaling [29] and induces activation
of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [30]. PN enhances p53
activity by promoting the ubiquitination of mouse double
minute 2 homolog (MDM2) [31] and depletes histone
deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) protein [32]. We and others have
already shown diverse activities of PN in melanoma cells.
In melanoma cell lines, A375, 1205Lu and WM793, PN
inhibits proliferation and adhesion, induces cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis and reduces constitutive and induced
NF-κB activity [33, 34]. In SK-MEL-28 cells, PN rapidly
induces ROS, and activates extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and NADPH oxidase [35]. In patientderived melanospheres, it reduces the frequency of ATPbinding cassette, sub-family B, member 5 (ABCB5)positive cells and clonogenic capacity [19]. The influence
of PN on MITF-M has not been yet studied.
MITF-M expression in melanocytes and melanoma
cells was shown to be suppressed by multiple inhibitors
of HDAC1 [36]. As PN can inhibit HDAC1 in breast and
colon carcinoma cells [32], we hypothesized that MITF-M
level might be also diminished by PN in melanoma cells.
However, it was also possible that PN could elevate the
MITF level because it is an inhibitor of NF-κB and the
gene expression reciprocity between NF-κB and MITF
was reported in melanoma cell lines as modulating
intrinsic sensitivity of melanomas to inhibitors of the
BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway [37]. Therefore, we sought
to clarify the influence of PN on MITF in NF-κBlow and
NF-κBhigh populations. To limit off-target effects, we did
not modify cells genetically but instead we have chosen
patient-derived melanoma populations with originally
distinct molecular characteristics: (i) BRAFWT, MITFMhigh/NF-κBlow, (ii) BRAFV600E, MITF-Mhigh/NF-κBhigh, (iii)
BRAFV600E, MITF-Mlow/NF-κBhigh.

characteristics than serum-containing medium [38, 39,
40]. Three of them, DMBC11, DMBC12 and DMBC21
harbored mutation in BRAF (BRAFV600E), the most highly
recurrent genetic aberration in melanoma [41] (Figure 1A).
DMBC17 and DMBC21 were slow-cycling populations
and their doubling time was above 60 hours, whereas
doubling time of DMBC11 and DMBC12 populations was
about 20-24 hours (Figure 1B).
MITF-M transcript was present in slow-cycling
populations DMBC17 and DMBC21 at the level similar to
that in melanocytes (NHEM), whereas MITF-M expression
in DMBC11 and DMBC12 populations showing a high
proliferation rate was very low as in A375 cells (Figure 1C).
The most substantial difference between tested populations
was observed in the basal level of MITF-M protein, which
migrates as a doublet and it has lower molecular weight
than other non-melanocyte-specific isoforms (Figure
1D). Concerning MITF-M activity, MITF-M-dependent
pigmentation-related genes, TYR and MLANA, were
expressed in DMBC17 and DMBC21 populations at
similar levels as in melanocytes (NHEM) (Figure 1E). This
indicates that DMBC17 and DMBC21 cell populations
were highly heterogeneous and besides cycling cells they
contained a large fraction of differentiated melanoma cells,
which is further confirmed in Figure 2A. In DMBC11
and DMBC12 cells the expression of these genes was
several hundred fold lower than in NHEM (Figure 1E).
Thus, we had four melanoma patient-derived populations
with different characteristics: (1) DMBC17: BRAFWT,
MITF-Mhigh, slow-cycling, highly differentiated,
(2) DMBC21: BRAFV600E, MITF-Mhigh, slow-cycling,
highly differentiated and (3,4) DMBC11 and DMBC12:
BRAFV600E, MITF-Mlow, fast-cycling, less differentiated.

PN reduces the percentage of melanoma cells
expressing MITF at high level
First, the influence of PN on the percentage of MITF
(total)-positive cells was assessed using flow cytometry. At
this stage of the study it was not clear whether PN would
increase or reduce the percentage of MITFhigh melanoma
cells. After 20 hours, PN at 10 μM and 20 μM markedly
reduced the percentage of cells expressing MITF at high
level (not shown). More interestingly, this diminution was
already visible after 4 hours (Figure 2A). Changes in the
percentages of Melan-A-positive cells induced by PN were
much lower (Figure 2A). Since MITF was substantially
reduced by PN treatment, results for only one of MITFMlow populations (DMBC12) were included.

RESULTS
Patient-derived melanoma populations exert
different doubling rate and basal expression of
MITF/MITF-M and MITF-dependent genes

PN decreases MITF-M protein level in the
nucleus and cytoplasm of melanoma cells

Four patient-derived melanoma populations were
grown in stem cell medium (SCM) as we have previously
shown that this medium better preserves the parent tumor

As the MITF antibody used in the flow cytometry
detects all isoforms of MITF, the influence of PN on
MITF-M isoform was subsequently assessed using Western

PN-induced MITF-M depletion is proteasome-,
lysosome- and caspase-independent

blotting. MITF-M, a protein with a molecular weight
between 50 and 65 kDa depending on its posttranslational
modifications [12], was almost completely depleted by
20 μM PN in MITF-Mhigh populations after 24 hours, and
similar effects were induced already after 4 hours (Figure
2B). PN eradicated MITF-M protein both in nucleus and
cytoplasm as shown for MITF-Mhigh DMBC21 population
(Figure 2C). We also noted that the inverse correlation
between the level of MITF-M and phosphorylated p65
(NF-κB subunit) is not always true as we had DMBC21
cells that were MITF-Mhigh/NF-κBhigh. Moreover, PN
simultaneously reduced the level of both MITF-M and
phosphorylated p65 (Figure 2B).

The minimal time necessary for a substantial
reduction of MITF-M protein level was determined
(Figure 3A). MITF-M was rapidly reduced by 20 μM PN
and already after 30 minutes first signs of protein depletion
were detected, and after 4 hours almost no MITF-M was
left. The phosphorylated p65 was completely eradicated
already after 30 minutes further supporting the notion
that MITF-M level does not inversely depend on NF-κB
signaling (Figure 3A). Several mechanisms might be
considered as responsible for MITF-M depletion. First, we

investigated whether PN could induce ERK1/2 activity,
which might contribute to the proteosomal degradation
of MITF-M [42, 43]. When the membrane showing
time-dependent depletion of MITF-M in DMBC21
cells was immunoblotted for phosphorylated ERK1/2,
the activity of ERK1 and ERK2 was increased by PN
also in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3A). When
levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were assessed in

untreated melanoma cells, it appeared that melanoma
cell populations differed in basal levels of active ERK1/2
(Figure 3B), and ERK1/2high populations, DMBC12 and
DMBC17 expressed MITF-M at either very low or high
levels, respectively. Therefore, it was rather unlikely
that ERK1/2 activity was responsible for MITF-M
level. To further confirm this conclusion, the activation
of ERK1/2 was blocked by GSK1120212 (trametinib,

TRA), an inhibitor of MEK. As expected, TRA at 0.5
μM used alone completely inhibited phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 but did not affect MITF-M level (Figure 3C).
In combination with PN, TRA did not prevent PN from
action, and a full eradication of MITF-M was observed

in MITF-Mhigh populations, DMBC17 and DMBC21
(Figure 3C). MITF-M depletion was observed even when
ERK1/2 activity was first blocked with TRA and then PN
was added. This clearly indicates that ERK1/2 was not
involved in PN-induced MITF-M depletion.

min) or caspase inhibitors (50 μM zDEVD or 50 μM zVAD; 30 min) and 20 μM PN was added for additional 4 hours. MCL-1 was used as
a control of BOR-triggered inhibition of proteasomal turnover, PARP as a control of caspase inhibition. Equal loading was confirmed by
β-actin or ERK1/2. Representative results are shown.

MITF-M proteasomal degradation can be triggered
by ERK1/2- [42] but also by glycogen synthase kinase
3 (GSK3)-dependent MITF-M phosphorylation [44].
To investigate contribution of proteasomal degradation
to PN-induced MITF-M depletion, 0.1 μM bortezomib
(BOR) was used but it did not prevent PN-induced
downregulation of MITF-M (Figure 3D). To rule out
the possibility that the lysosomal pathway is involved
in the PN-induced loss of MITF-M, chloroquine (CQ), a
lysosomal inhibitor was used. Chloroquine did not affect
MITF-M level and did not interfere with PN-induced
MITF-M depletion. As cleavage of MITF-M by caspases
has been shown and interestingly, it generates fragment of
MITF-M endowed with a proapoptotic activity [45], we
sought to investigate whether caspases were responsible
for PN-stimulated MITF-M degradation. Pretreatment
with a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk or caspase-3

inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk did not affect PN-induced
depletion of MITF-M (Figure 3E).

PN reduces MITF-M transcript and HDAC1
protein level
As we excluded PN-induced degradation of MITF-M
protein along any of known pathways, we next analyzed
PN influence on MITF transcript level. qRT-PCR revealed
that 20 μM PN substantially reduced mRNA levels of MITF
and its M isoform in MITF-Mhigh populations DMBC21
(Figure 4A) and DMBC17 (not shown), whereas these
transcripts expressed at low levels already in untreated
DMBC12 cells (Figure 1C), remained unaffected by PN
treatment (Figure 4A). Of note, the post-PN transcript level
of MITF-M in DMBC21 population was still 3-fold higher
than in DMBC12 population (not shown).

Previously, PN was shown to specifically inhibit
HDAC1 in breast cancer cells [32]. Moreover, inhibition
of HDAC1 was reported as the mechanism of MITF
downregulation in melanoma [36]. Using vorinostat
(VOR), an inhibitor of HDAC1 activity, we confirmed
that MITF-M is down-regulated by HDAC1 inhibition
also in MITF-Mhigh DMBC21 cell population (Figure
4B). The kinetics of PN-induced HDAC1 inhibition for
DMBC21 cells is shown in Figure 4C, top. The faster
migrating band showing the degradation product [46], was
already present after 30 min with 20 μM PN (Figure 4C,
top). HDAC1 cleavage was also observed in other three

melanoma populations treated with 20 μM PN for 4 hours
(not shown). The prolonged incubation with 10 μM PN
caused complete disappearance of HDAC1 protein in all
tested populations (Figure 4C, bottom).

PN reduces proliferation, viability and
clonogenic capacity of melanoma populations
PN inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death
displayed by an accumulation of cells in subG1 (Figure
5A, 5B and 5C). Induction of cell death was more efficient
in DMBC12 population than in slow-cycling MITF-Mhigh

DMBC21 population (Figure 5C). We have previously
shown that PN induces apoptosis in melanoma cells [33,
34]. In the present study, poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase
(PARP) cleavage, a marker of apoptosis induction, was
observed, and again it was more substantial in DMBC12
population than in DMBC17 and DMBC21 (Figure 5D).
Exposure to PN for 4 hours was also long enough to
markedly reduce a colony formation ability measured in
soft agar after 3 weeks (Figure 5E).

β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity at acidic pH (Figure
6B) as shown for DMBC21 population. Similar results
were obtained for DMBC17 population (not included).
In contrast, not much stronger staining intensity was
apparent in PN-treated MITF-Mlow DMBC12 cells than
in control cells (bars in Figure 6B). Thus, induction of
senescence was accompanied by MITF-M depletion only
in MITF-Mhigh melanoma cells. Of note, the basal activity
of senescence-associated β-galactosidase was much lower
in DMBC12 cells than in DMBC21 cells, and incubation
with its substrate had to be prolonged from 4 hours
(DMBC21) to 22 hours (DMBC12). Searching for other
cell-autonomous differences which might account for
lack of PN-induced senescence in DMBC12 population,
we examined basal MCL-1 level in untreated melanoma
cells. MCL-1 was already shown to reduce susceptibility
of cancer cells to drug-induced senescence [47]. MITFMhigh populations, DMBC21 and DMBC17 had low levels
of MCL-1, which might create the conditions suitable
for PN-induced senescence, whereas high level of MCL1 protein in DMBC11 and DMBC12 populations might

PN increases senescence in MITF-Mhigh
melanoma cell populations
MITF-M depletion induces either senescence or
apoptosis depending on the cellular background [12]. As
PN was less efficient in triggering apoptosis in MITFMhigh populations, DMBC21 and DMBC17, we assessed
whether it induced senescence. Indeed, 20 μM PN induced
the hallmarks of senescence, such as (1) the enlargement
of cells and increase in cell granularity already after
22 hours (Figure 6A), and (2) senescence-associated

restrict induction of senescence (Figure 6C). Of note,
the expression of MCL-1 in DMBC21 cells was not
deficient as this protein was accumulated in the presence
of bortezomib (Figure 3E).

MITF-M and NF-κB might induce senescence without
triggering these deleterious effects, which might be
beneficial for melanoma therapy. Chemotherapy-induced
senescence was reported to be inhibited by MCL-1 [47].
Our results showing that senescence can be efficiently
induced only in MCL-1low melanoma cells support this
finding.
PN was reported to specifically deplete HDAC1
protein in breast cancer cells without affecting other class
I/II HDACs [32]. Our study has shown for the first time
that PN can markedly decrease the HDAC1 level also
in melanoma. MITF-M expression was already reported
to be suppressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells
by several HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), and this MITF
depletion did not reduce melanocyte viability [36, 60].
Moreover, combined treatment with MAPK pathway
and HDAC inhibitors suppressed MITF expression and
melanoma resistance offering a novel clinical strategy
to achieve more durable control of some BRAFV600E
melanomas [60]. Furthermore, a phase I clinical study of
HDAC inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) with ipilimumab
with unresectable III/IV melanoma is currently recruiting
participants
(ClinicalTrials.gov;
NCT02032810).
Although the mechanisms of MITF downregulation by
HDACi are poorly understood, they probably involve the
interference with upstream transcriptional regulator(s) of
MITF-M. Expression, stability and activity of MITF-M
are dynamically controlled on multiple levels by several
pathways, whose activities are determined by genetic
background and the microenvironment-dependent
physiological context [11, 12, 13]. In the present study,
PN downregulates MITF-M expression level similarly to
vorinostat, an HDAC1 inhibitor, and regardless of RAS/
RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activity status. This effect
is observed in both wild type BRAF and BRAFV600E,
and inhibition of MEK by GSK1120212 (trametinib)
and induction of ERK1/2 activity by PN itself do not
interfere with PN-triggered depletion of MITF-M.
Several studies indicate the close relationship between
WNT/β-catenin signaling and MITF-M expression and
stability [44, 52, 61]. We have reported previously that
the microenvironment-driven suppression of the WNT/
β-catenin pathway is accompanied by downregulation
of MITF in MITFhigh patient-derived melanoma cell
populations [38]. Interestingly, the basal expression
of LEF1, one of the MITF-M upstream regulators and
effector of WNT signaling, was much higher in MITFMhigh than in MITF-Mlow populations, and PN markedly
reduced the mRNA level of LEF1 (not shown). As we
excluded the influence of PN on proteasomal turnover or
caspase-mediated MITF-M degradation, further studies
are needed to delineate the mechanism(s) responsible for
PN-driven MITF-M downregulation.
Our findings that PN efficiently reduces the
levels of MITF-M and HDAC1 in melanoma cells,
especially when combined with the previous results

DISCUSSION
MITF-M is a transcription factor specific for
melanocytes and melanoma [8, 10, 12]. NF-κB is
constitutively activated in many tumors [48, 49], and
is involved in the cross talk with several transcription
factors determining the cellular fate in response to
stress [50]. The reduction of MITF expression has been
reported as the result of the stimulation of melanoma cells
with interleukin-1α or 1β suggesting that this process is
NF-κB-dependent [51]. Moreover, the gene expression
reciprocity between NF-κB and MITF in melanoma and
a transition between phenotypes MITF-Mhigh/NF-κBlow
and MITF-Mlow/NF-κBhigh as a part of melanoma plasticity
in response to therapies targeting the BRAF/MEK/ERK
pathway have been proposed [37]. The hypothesis of
opposing regulatory networks operating through these two
transcription factors prompted us to investigate the effect
of PN, an inhibitor of NF-κB [16], on MITF-M expression
in melanoma cells. Our results demonstrate, however, that
PN very efficiently depletes MITF-M, both in the nucleus
and in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, existence of the cell
population that has MITF-Mhigh/NF-κBhigh phenotype
(DMBC21) indicates that NF-κB not always antagonizes
MITF expression in BRAFV600E-mutant melanomas. As (i)
there was no tight inverse correlation between the level of
MITF-M and phosphorylated p65 in untreated melanoma
cells, and (ii) PN simultaneously reduced levels of both
MITF-M and phosphorylated p65, a suppressive role of
the NF-κB signaling on MITF-M protein level seems not
plausible, at least for some melanomas. There are other
examples of drugs simultaneously reducing MITF and NFκB activities in melanoma cells [52, 53].
Senescence is recognized as an important process in
the context of aging, wound healing and tumor suppression
[54, 55]. In response to BRAFV600E mutation, melanocytes
form growth-arrested nevi that are characterized by
expression of several markers of senescence [56]. In
BRAFV600E melanoma cells, vemurafenib induces features
of senescence in addition to apoptosis [57]. In the present
study, the induction of senescence by PN coincides with
inhibition of MITF-M in MITF-Mhigh cells, whereas cell
death was more efficiently induced in MITF-Mlow cells.
MITF suppression was already reported as accompanying
a lineage-specific senescence program in melanoma
cells [58]. It was also shown that cellular senescence is
associated with activation of NF-κB, which mediates
the proinvasive capacity of the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP), and downregulation of NFκB can reduce proinvasive properties of this secretome
[59]. Thus, PN by simultaneous downregulation of

on its inhibitory effect on NF-κB activity, might have
important implications for the clinics. PN exerts, however,
low solubility and bioavailability as shown in a phase I
dose escalation trial [62]. It was demonstrated that the
solubility could be improved by using the fumarate salt
of dimethyloamino parthenolide (DMAPT) [63, 64].
Another direction is to develop an efficient PN delivery
system for cancer treatment and the work is ongoing [65].
But it should be also considered that this natural drug
has been used for centuries as a bioactive component of
feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) to treat fever, migraine,
rheumatoid arthritis and menstrual irregularities, and in
this form is efficient and of low toxicity. Therefore, the
present study strongly suggests that PN/feverfew could
be considered as a part of prophylactic treatment or
combined treatment when simultaneous inhibition of NFκB, MITF-M and HDAC1 is needed. As targeting NF-κB
enhances response to RAF inhibitors [66] and targeting
MITF along with HDAC prevents cAMP/MITF-driven
resistance to MAPK-pathway inhibitors [60], PN might
be considered as a part of combined therapy for melanoma
patients with BRAFV600E-driven melanomas.

MITF protein levels vary between melanoma
specimens [67], which is also reflected in the present
study performed in patient-derived populations. Both
high and low MITF-M expression levels have been linked
with melanoma development. Alterations in the MITF-M
level have been shown to induce changes in melanoma
phenotype and function [13]. Inter- and intraindividual
heterogeneity of melanomas results in the differential
response to drugs [2, 68]. Our previous and present studies
provide evidence that the character and intensity of cellular
effects of PN can be diverse in different melanomas,
and MITF-M level can be one of the determinants. The
outcome of treatment with PN, cell death or senescence,
might also depend on other molecules crucial for
melanoma proliferation and survival such as MCL-1,
and therefore melanoma tumors have to be molecularly
characterized to select appropriate drugs for combined
treatment. Taken together, the results of the present study
provide data for a model (Figure 7) in which the possible
pleiotropic effects of PN are narrowed by the molecular
context exhibited in the present study as MITF-M and NFκB levels. PN-induced inhibition of HDAC1 seems to be a
common mechanism for all melanomas.

Figure 7: Schematic model of parthenolide (PN) activity in MITF-Mhigh and MITF-Mlow patient-derived melanoma cell
populations. The present results clearly indicate that PN decreases MITF-M on the transcript and protein levels in MITF-Mhigh melanoma

cell populations. Independently on the basal MITF-M expression level, PN inhibits the activity of p65/NF-κB and decreases HDAC1 level.
Considering previous reports showing the MITF-M dependence on HDAC1 activity [36, 60] and PN capacity to suppress HDAC1 [32], we
hypothesize that PN might influence the MITF-M level by inhibition of HDAC1. Diverse cellular effects of PN treatment are predefined
by molecular characteristics of melanoma cell populations. In MITF-Mhigh melanoma cells either NF-κBhigh or NF-κBlow (blue background)
PN induces cellular senescence with minor cytotoxic effects, while in MITF-Mlow populations (light red background) cell death is the
dominant cellular outcome. Other cell-autonomous differences e.g., in the MCL-1 might also contribute. PN can be developed as a part of
combination therapy against melanoma when simultaneous inhibition of MITF-M, NF-κB and HDAC1 is needed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

along with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (BD
Pharmingen). Typically, 30,000 cells/sample were
analyzed. Appropriate isotype controls were used. To
exclude dead cells from the analysis, LIVE/DEAD®
Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) was
used. Acquisition was performed using FACSVerse flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using BD Cell
Quest software.

Drugs and chemicals
Parthenolide (PN) was purchased from Biomol,
Z-VAD-fmk from Promega (Madison, WI), Z-DEVDfmk from BD Biosciences, chloroquine (CQ) from
Sigma-Aldrich, bortezomib (BOR), vorinostat (VOR) and
trametinib (TRA) from Selleck Chemicals LLC. Chemical
structure of PN was prepared in ChemOffice 15.0.

Cell cycle analysis
Melanoma cells were treated with PN for 24 h. Cells
were collected and fixed with 70% (w/v) ethanol at -20°C.
After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in PI
Staining Buffer containing RNase (Becton Dickinson).
Following incubation for 30 min at room temperature,
cells were analysed using a FACSVerse flow cytometer.
ModFit LT 3.0 software (Verify Software) was used to
calculate the percentages in each cell cycle phase and
FACSuite software (BD Biosciences) to calculate the
percentages of cells in subG1.

Tumor tissues
Melanoma specimens were obtained during
surgical procedures. Permission was granted by Ethical
Commission of Medical University of Lodz, and all
patients consented to participate in the study.

In vitro cell culture
Cells from tumor samples were isolated as
described previously [69]. Briefly, tumor fragments were
minced and incubated in Hank’s balanced salt solution
(Sigma-Aldrich) with 3 mmol/l calcium chloride, 1
mg/ml collagenase IV and 10 μg/ml DNase I at 37°C.
Isolated cells were grown for one day in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then,
they were cultured in stem cell medium (SCM), consisting
of DMEM/F12 low osmolality medium (Lonza), B-27
supplement (Gibco), growth factors: 10 ng/ml bFGF and
20 ng/ml EGF (BD Biosciences), insulin (10 μg/ml),
heparin (1 ng/ml) and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin,
100 μg/ml streptomycin). Medium was exchanged twice
a week.

Preparation of cell lysates/fractions and
immunoblotting
Preparation of cell lysates and immunodetection
were described previously [70]. Briefly, melanoma cells
were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH
8.0, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with freshly
added protease and phosphatase inhibitors. To obtain
cellular fractions, cells were homogenized in hypotonic
buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10
mM KCl, 0.2 mM PMSF and 0.5 mM DTT and cytosolic
fraction was separated from nuclei that were lysed in
RIPA buffer. Cell lysates and fractions were diluted in 2x
Laemmli buffer and protein samples (15 μg each) were
loaded on standard 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The
proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P PVDF
membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated in a
blocking solution: 5% nonfat milk in PBS-Tween 0.05%
or 5% phosphoBLOCKER (Cell Biolabs) in PBS-Tween
0.05%. Primary antibodies detecting PARP, MCL-1,
HDAC1, lamin B were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
MITF, p-p65 (Ser536), p65, p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204),
ERK1/2 from Cell Signaling Technology. BRAFV600E
antibodies recognizing V600E-mutated, but not wild-type
BRAF were from Biomol. Quantitative analysis of the
results was performed by using NIH ImageJ software.

Viability assay
Viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining
according to standard procedures and analyzed using a
FACSVerse flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Acid phosphatase activity (APA) assay
To assess relative changes in the viable cell
number, the activity of acid phosphatase was measured
colorimetrically [69]. Doubling time (DT) was calculated
using the formula: DT = (t – t0)log2 / (logA – logA0),
in which t and t0 are the times at which the cells were
assessed and A and A0 are the absorbance at times t and t0,
respectively.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)

Flow cytometry analysis of MITF- and
Melan-A-positive cells

Total RNA isolation and qRT-PCR were described
previously [71]. Briefly, RNA was isolated and purified
using Total RNA Isolation kit (A&A Biotechnology).
cDNA was subsequently synthesized by using random

The following antibodies were used: anti-MITF
(Abcam) along with APC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Melan-A (DAKO)

primers (Promega) and SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The amplification was
performed by using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR 2x Master
Mix (Kapa Biosystems) and Rotor-Gene 3000 Real-Time
DNA analysis system (Corbett Research). RPS17 was used
as a reference gene. The relative mRNA expression was
calculated based on the expression ratio of the target gene
versus reference gene, and correction of amplification
efficiency of the individual transcripts was included as
described by Pfaffl [72]. Sequences of primers used in
qRT-PCR were shown elsewhere [38].
