ABSTRACT
The second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) dasatinib is a clinically
approved drug for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as Ph+ acute lymphoblastic
leukemia. In addition to its antileukemic effects, dasatinib was shown to impact on
normal hematopoiesis and cells of the immune system.
Due to the fact that the murine in vivo studies so far have not been performed
in a chronic-phase CML model under steady-state conditions, our aim was to study
the hematopoietic effects of dasatinib (20 mg/kg p.o.) in BCR-ABL expressing
SCLtTAxBCR-ABL double transgenic (dtg) mice. Dasatinib robustly antagonized the
CML phenotype in vivo in our transgenic mouse model, and this effect included both
mature and immature cell populations. However, similar to patients with CML, the
fraction of LinnegSca-1+KIT+CD48negCD150+ hematopoietic stem cells was not reduced
by dasatinib treatment, suggesting that these cells are not oncogene-addicted.
Moreover, we observed differential effects of dasatinib in these animals as compared
to wild-type (wt) animals: while granulocytes were significantly reduced in dtg
animals, they were increased in wt mice. And Ter119+ erythrocytic and B220+ B cells
were increased in dtg mice but decreased in wt mice. Finally, while dasatinib induced
a shift from CD49b/NK1.1 positive NK cells from the bone marrow to the spleen in wt
animals, there was no change in dtg mice. In conclusion, the present mouse model
provides a useful tool to study mechanisms of TKI resistance and dasatinib-associated
beneficial effects and adverse events.

trials for other cancers. Dasatinib has been shown to exert
marked effects on the normal hematopoietic system [1–3].
In vitro, dasatinib induces immunosuppression by targeting
key kinases of the immune system such as Lyn and
Brutons’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), thereby inhibiting B- and
T cell signaling [4]. Furthermore, several studies showed
an immunomodulatory effect of dasatinb, including

INTRODUCTION
Dasatinib is a second-generation ABL tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI), approved for the treatment of
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and BCR-ABL-positive

multitarget specificity, it is also being tested in clinical

mobilization of natural killer (NK) cells and enhanced
NK cell cytotoxicity, both of which were not seen with
imatinib or nilotinib [5–8]. The immunomodulatory
function of dasatinib and the activation of large granular
lymphocytes (LGLs) were shown to be associated
with a better outcome, being associated with increased
cytogenetic and molecular remissions [7, 9]. A correlation
between LGL lymphocytosis and the development of
autoimmune symptoms such as pleural effusions and
colitis has been postulated [10]. Pleural effusions were
more likely induced by accumulation of lymphocytes than
by fluid retention alone [11].
Several studies have addressed the influence of
dasatinib on non-malignant hematopoietic cells. Schade
et al and Blake et al demonstrated that dasatinib inhibits
T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction, resulting in
reduced proliferation and cytokine production but not
apoptosis of T cells, if dasatinib is constantly present
[12, 13]. Conversely, dasatinib induced apoptosis in
human B-lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood or
bone marrow, resulting in a strong reduction of B cells
[2]. Through off-target inhibition of Btk, this reduction
also resulted in reduced memory B cell numbers and
impairment of the B cell response in dasatinib-treated
patients [14]. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo data of
dasatinib treatment can differ significantly in T cell but
also NK cell differentiation and activation, due to the
short half-life of the TKI in plasma in comparison to the
endured presence in cell culture [15, 16].
We studied the hematopoietic effects of dasatinib
in BCR-ABL expressing SCLtTAxBCR-ABL double
transgenic (dtg) mice [17]. This model allows the analysis
of dasatinib-induced effects on mature blood and immune
cells as well as on hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells in BCR-ABL expressing and control mice. In
wild-type mice, dasatinib had been shown to transiently
activate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and induce the
proliferation of HSCs and a loss of lineage-committed
progenitor cells, and this was associated with increases
of stem cell factor (SCF) serum levels [18]. Given that
our previous studies had demonstrated that BCR-ABL
induces an increase of Lin-Sca-1+Kit+ (LSK) cells and
granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GMPs) [17],
we now studied how dasatinib influences the proliferation
and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells. Moreover, with our observation that BCR-ABL
expression leads to a strong decrease of B220+ B cells
in the bone marrow and the spleen [19], and with the
evidence by Oksvold and colleagues shown that dasatinib
induces apoptosis in normal B cells [2], we studied how
dasatinib affects B- and T cells as well as NK cells in a
CML in vivo model (both in a steady-state setting or after
transplantation of BCR-ABL positive bone marrow stem
cells). Finally, we studied whether dasatinib is able to
reverse the BCR-ABL induced CML phenotype, including
organ infiltration by myeloid cells, splenomegaly, and
bone marrow stem and progenitor cell expansion.

Dasatinib-induced changes of the
immunophenotype in wild-type mice
In this study, we evaluated the effect of dasatinib
on different cell types in bone marrow (BM), spleen and
peripheral blood (PB) by FACS analysis. An overview of
the different mice and treatment schedules is depicted in
Supplementary Figure 1.
We analyzed the immunophenotype in BM and
spleen of 8 week old FVB/N wt mice treated for 14 days
with 5 or 20 mg/kg dasatinib compared to vehicle control
(5% DMSO in citrate buffer). The concentrations where
based on previous in vivo experiments [12, 20]. The last
dosing of dasatinib was performed on the day before the
final analysis. Flow cytometry measurements revealed a
significant increase of Gr1 positive granulocytes in the BM
and spleen that was associated with a significant reduction
of the fraction of lymphocytes (Figure 1A). This was due
to a significant increase of CD11b positive cells with high
coexpression of Gr1 (mature granulocytes; 1.8- and 5.6fold in BM and spleen, resp.) but not low Gr1 coexpression
(immature granulocytes) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, this was
only seen with the higher dose (20 mg/kg) but not the lower
dose (5 mg/kg) of dasatinib.
Both doses of dasatinib significantly increased
CD41+ megakaryocytic cells in the spleen as well as
with 5 mg/kg dasatinib in the BM, while the fraction
of these cells was significantly reduced in the BM
with 20 mg/kg dasatinib (Figure 1C). The fraction of
Ter119+ erythroid cells was significantly decreased
in BM and spleen after 20 mg/kg dasatinib treatment
(Figure 1C).
Spleen weight was slightly, but significantly reduced
with the higher but not the lower dose of dasatinib (Figure
1D). Higher doses of dasatinib (20 mg/kg) induced a
significant decrease of the fraction of B220+ B lymphocytes
in the BM and spleen, while lower doses did not (Figure 1E).
Furthermore, the fraction of CD4+ T cells was significantly
reduced in the BM, while CD3+ and CD8+ cells were not
changed (Figure 1E), and there were no changes of CD3+,
CD4+, or CD8+ cells in the spleen (Supplementary Table
1A). The ratio between CD4 and CD8 positive CD3+ cells
was not altered (data not shown). Finally, dasatinib (only 20
mg/kg shown) induced a significant increase of the fraction
of NK1.1/CD49b double positive NK cells in the spleen
but a decrease in the BM, suggesting mobilization of NK
cells from the BM to the spleen (Figure 1F). Analysis of
lymphocytes for the expression of CD49b and NK1.1 alone,
demonstrated a significant reduction of CD49b+ lymphocytes
after 20 mg/kg dasatinib in the BM and a similar trend for
NK1.1+ cells (Supplementary Figure 2A–2B). There was
no difference between male and female mice regarding the
response to dasatinib (data not shown).
Based on the more pronounced effects of the higher
dose of dasatinib (20 mg/kg) and in order to optimize

treatment (Supplementary Table 1B). Analysis of CD49b+
lymphocytes showed an increase in the BM of dtg mice
that were significantly reduced after dasatinib treatment
(Supplementary Figure 3B). In the spleen, no changes were
seen in CD49b+ lymphocytes (data not shown).

Dasatinib prolongs survival of transgenic
BCR-ABL expressing mice and reverses BCRABL induced changes but does not induce
lymphocytosis

As different studies showed an immunomodulatory
effect of dasatinib in patients with CML and we detected
an increase of NK cells in the spleen of wt animals, we
tested dasatinib in our CML mouse model.
For our experimental setup, we induced primary
donor FVB/N CD45.1+ SCLtTA single transgenic (stg)
and SCLtTAxBCR-ABL double transgenic (dtg) animals
for 7 days (withdrawal of tetracycline) prior to BM
isolation and transplantation into irradiated mice. This
transplantation model allows for the detection of cellintrinsic effects of BCR-ABL positive cells. As expected,
immunophenotyping of the pooled bone marrow showed
an increase of the fraction of granulocytes in the dtg donor
mice (Supplementary Figure 3A). After 9 days of dasatinib
or vehicle treatment, we sacrificed the mice for analysis
(controls: n=6/group, stg dasa: n=5, dtg dasa: n=3). Due
to the transplantation, we detected high percentages of
granulocytes in the BM of BCR-ABL positive as well as
stg animals (Figure 2A). The fraction of Gr1+ cells was
increased in the spleen of dtg vs control mice, but there
was no change with dasatinib (Figure 2A). The fraction of
total lymphocytes in the BM and the spleen of transplanted
mice was slightly decreased in BCR-ABL positive mice, but
was not significantly affected by dasatinib (Figure 2A). The
fraction of CD41+ cells (megakaryocytes) in the BM was
not altered by either BCR-ABL expression nor affected by
dasatinib (Figure 2B). However, in the spleen, the fraction
of CD41+ cells was more than 2-fold elevated in dtg mice,
but this effect was not reversed by dasatinib (Figure 2B).
As described before, the fraction of Ter119+ erythroid
cells was decreased in the BM of BCR-ABL positive mice
and reversed by dasatinib (even though this did not reach
statistical significance), while there was no significant BCRABL induced change of Ter119+ cells in the spleen; yet, the
fraction of these cells was increased in the spleen of BCRABL positive but not control mice (Figure 2B).
The BM of BCR-ABL expressing mice showed a
significant decrease of the fraction of B220+ B cells, and this
effect was reverted by dasatinib (Figure 2C). Interestingly,
while the fraction of B220+ cells was also reduced in the
spleen of BCR-ABL positive mice, dasatinib treatment did
not revert this effect in the spleen (Figure 2C).
BCR-ABL positive mice showed a significant increase
in the fraction of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the BM,
and this effect was reversed by dasatinib (Figure 2C). No
significant differences in the fraction of CD3+, CD4+, and
CD8+ T cells were observed in the spleen after dasatinib

Since the transplantation procedure used for
the previous experiments may have altered some of
the dasatinib-induced effects due to the prolonged
manifestation of complete hematopoiesis, we additionally
assessed the influence of dasatinib treatment under steadystate conditions (without the need for BM transplantation).
For these experiments, we induced the expression of BCRABL in double transgenic (dtg) mice at day 1 and treated
these mice with control vehicle or 20 mg/kg dasatinib
starting at day 2.
Dasatinib significantly prolonged the survival of
BCR-ABL positive (dtg) mice (Figure 3A). Based on these
results, we again induced the expression of BCR-ABL
directly in primary dtg animals and started the gavage after 1
day without tetracycline with 20 mg/kg dasatinib or vehicle
control and analyzed the mice after 7 days of treatment (n=4/
group). The last dosing was 1 hour before the analysis. In
these BCR-ABL positive mice, dasatinib induced a reduction
of the fraction of Gr1+ cells in spleen, peripheral blood
(PB) (both significant) and BM (non-significant) (Figure
3B). Conversely, there was a dasatinib-induced increase of
total lymphocytes (as assessed by FSClo and SSClo profile),
particularly in the BM (Figure 3B). When analyzing
different subsets of Gr1+ cells, dasatinib most strongly
reduced the fraction of Gr1 high (mature) granulocytic cells
in the spleen (with a similar trend in BM), while the effect in
Gr1 low (more immature) granulocytes was less pronounced
(Figure 3c). As in wild-type animals (Figure 1C), dasatinib
reduced the fraction of CD41+ cells in the BM (no change
in spleen or PB) (Figure 3D). However, different from wildtype mice (Figure 1C), dasatinib increased the fraction of
Ter119+ cells in the BM (no significant change in spleen or
PB) (Figure 3D).
The fraction of B220+ B cells was strongly increased
in BM and spleen (Figure 3E) as seen in the transplantation
setting, both indicative of a reversal of BCR-ABL induced
suppression of B cells. The fraction of CD3+, CD4+, and
CD8+ cells in BM and spleen was reduced by dasatinib
(Figure 3E; changes significant from CD3+ and CD8+
cells). Analysis of the spleen weight revealed a clinically
relevant 34% decrease (Figure 3F), which did not reach
statistical significance, possibly due to the short time
course of treatment. There was no consistent change of
CD49b/NK1.1 double positive NK cells in the presence of
dasatinib (Figure 3G), but analysis of CD49b and NK1.1

that was not seen when gated on all living cells (data not
shown). Differential cell counts of the BM confirmed
our FACS data by showing a significant increase in
lymphocytes and a significant decrease of monocytes,
as well as a (non-significant) reduction of myelocytes
and promyelocytes (Figure 3H). Single transgenic (stg)
animals were treated as a control cohort (n=5 per group)
and were analyzed after administration of dasatinib for
11 times, applying the last dose 1 hour before the final
analysis (Supplementary Table 3).

were associated with a favorable outcome of the patients
with increased cytogenetic and molecular remission [7, 9,
23]. Therefore, we analyzed whether dasatinib treatment
was associated with such adverse events or signs for the
latter in the mice studied. Gross pathology analysis did not
show any clinically relevant pleural effusion.
Evaluation of lung histologies was performed by
measurements of the thickness of muscularis propria of
lung arteries and height of bronchus epithelium as depicted
in Figure 5. We analyzed three vessels/bronchi per mouse
at three different positions and calculated the mean values
per lung. In our transplantation model, we saw a slight
reduction in thickness in both, muscularis media and
bronchial epithelium in the dasatinib treated stg but not dtg
mice, however, this did not reach statistical significance
(Figure 5A). This was confirmed in the primary transgenic
mice (without transplantation) which also showed no
significant change in arterial vessels or bronchus epithelia
thickness after dasatinib treatment (Figure 5B).
There was no dasatinib-induced colitis evident
in our mouse model, at least during the short course of
dasatinib treatment. In colon mucosa, no changes between
the two groups could be seen, but cytochemical NACE
staining of the small intestine revealed an infiltration
within the epithelium and less in the lamina propria by
granulocytes in the BCR-ABL expressing mice, which
was decreased after treatment with dasatinib (Figure 6).

Dasatinib induced changes in the stem and
progenitor compartment of BCR-ABL
expressing mice
CML is a stem cell disorder with expression of
BCR-ABL in various hematopoietic lineages that is
mimicked in the SCLtTAxBCR-ABL mouse model. The
percentage of Lin-Kit+Sca-1+ (LSK) cells, which are
enriched for HSCs, was shown to be increased in induced
dtg mice, as well as an expanded GMP (granulocytemacrophage progenitor) pool, presumably resulting in
neutrophilia, as described [17]. We analyzed the stem and
progenitor compartment of our dtg animals after 7 days
of dasatinib treatment. The gating strategy was adapted
from [21] and is depicted in Figure 4A. There was a
significant decrease of the fraction of LSK cells as well
as the multipotent progenitor-1 (MPP1) population in the
dasatinib treated animals (Figure 4B). Interestingly, this
was associated with a significant increase in the fraction of
phenotypic LT-HSCs (long-term hematopoietic stem cells)
compartment, suggesting that these most immature HSCs
were spared by dasatinib (Figure 4B). The short term-HSC
(ST-HSC) and MPP2 populations were not significantly
altered (Figure 4B). The analysis of the myeloid
progenitor cells demonstrated a significant increase in the
fraction of MEPs (megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors)
by dasatinib, while GMPs and CMPs (common myeloid
progenitor) fractions were reduced by dasatinib although
this did not reach significance. We confirmed reduction of
BCR-ABL kinase activity by Western blotting of lysates
generated from unfractionated BM or spleen cells of the
dtg mice described in Figure 3, with phosphorylation
levels of STAT5 and Crkl being strongly reduced by
dasatinib treatment (Figure 4C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report in vivo effects of dasatinib on
the cellular composition of the hematopoietic and immune
system in wild-type mice as well as in a tetracyclineinducible transgenic mouse model of BCR-ABL positive
CML-like disease. We analyzed dasatinib-induced effects
by flow cytometry in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen
under steady-state conditions as well as after bone
marrow transplantation. Furthermore, we conducted flow
cytometry analysis of stem- and progenitor cells in the BM
of BCR-ABL expressing mice treated with dasatinib or
vehicle control and performed histopathology to evaluate
effects on the BM, spleen, lung and intestine.
Dasatinib has been previously shown to inhibit
neutrophil function in vitro and in vivo in mice, but
effects of dasatinib on neutrophil counts were not
reported [24]. We found that 20 mg/kg of dasatinib
increased granulocytic cells in normal experimental mice
(Figure 1A). Yet, in BCR-ABL positive mice, dasatinib
decreased granulocytic cells. This discrepancy may have
been due to efficient inhibition of BCR-ABL positive
granulocytic cells by dasatinib but failure to induce nonleukemic granulocytes due to insufficient residual normal
hematopoiesis. In fact, this is very reminiscent of patients
with newly-diagnosed CML, where dasatinib causes
neutropenia. As described previously [17], BCR-ABL
expression in our transgenic mice induced a decrease of

of patients with CML, dasatinib treatment has been
associated, among other signs and symptoms, with adverse

high expression of c-kit and low Sca-1 expression (MPs). Further differentiation was done by staining for CD34 and CD16/32. MEPs

Ter-119 positive erythropoietic cells. Similar to the results
in the granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineage, there
was a pronounced effect of dasatinib on the BCR-ABL
expressing cells, with a recovery of Ter-119 cells in the
BM and spleen. This was due to recovered erythropoietic
cell production after dasatinib treatment, as shown by the
observed MEP increase in the BM (Figure 4B). Previous
studies demonstrated a KIT-induced inhibition of the first
steps of erythroblast differentiation that can be restored by
dasatinib, additionally explaining our findings [25].
Analysis of the lymphocytes of wild-type mice
revealed a decrease of B220+ B cells upon 20 mg/kg
dasatinib treatment, consistent with previous studies that
had shown this to be associated with apoptosis of mature
B cells and a differentiation block in the immature B
cell population [2]. Lower doses may efficiently inhibit
B cell development through inhibition of B cell receptor
signaling but may not be sufficient to induce apoptosis
[26]. B cell depletion in our BCR-ABL expressing mice
was reversed by dasatinib, which is in keeping with a
BCR-ABL mediated block in B cell differentiation [27]
as well as induction of apoptosis of BCR-ABL positive
lymphoid cells [28].

In patients, a clonal expansion of cytotoxic T and
NK cells was observed during dasatinib treatment that was
associated with better therapy response and autoimmunelike adverse reactions [7]. It was hypothesized that the
inhibition of immunoregulatory kinases by dasatinib
may activate a reversible immune reactivity resulting
in good clinical response. These effects were reported
to be concurrent with large granular lymphocyte (LGL)
lymphocytosis in the majority of cases [10]. This LGL
lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood (PB) was not
detected in our transgenic mouse model within 7 days of
dasatinib treatment (data not shown), but onset of LGL
lymphocytosis varied between one and eight months after
initiation of dasatinib therapy in patients [10]. FACS
analysis of BM and spleen of dasatinib-treated wt animals
revealed a reduction of CD4 positive T cells in the BM
after 14 days, while the CD3 and CD8 positive cells were
not affected. These results are in line with the finding
that T cell proliferation was inhibited by dasatinib in a
dose-dependent manner in an in vivo mixed lymphocyte
reaction experiment after adoptive transfer of donor
CD4+ T cells in allogenic donors [12]. There was a strong
increase in the fraction of T cells in the BM and spleen

of granulocytes in the folds of the small intestine of dtg (double transgenic) mice was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (NACE
staining). Dasatinib treatment of dtg mice strongly reduced the amount of granuloytic infiltration. Scale bar: 250 μm and 50 μm.

of BCR-ABL mice, both under steady-state conditions
and after BM transplantation, which was antagonized
by dasatinib treatment (Figure 2C and 3E). Previous
studies demonstrated a reduced amount of NK cells, as
well as functional defects of NK cells in CML patients
at diagnosis [29, 30]. Interestingly, in wt mice, dasatinib
led to a decrease of NK1.1/CD49b double positive cells
in the BM but an increase in the spleen, suggesting that
it enhanced migration of these cells from the BM to
the spleen. However, dasatinib treatment of BCR-ABL
positive mice did not significantly alter NK cells. With a
link between LGL lymphocytosis and cytomegalovirus
(CMV) reactivation having been established in CML
patients [5], this may not have been mimicked in our BCRABL mice due to breeding in isolated ventilated cages.
Dasatinib efficiently normalized the LSK, MEP, CMP and
GMP fractions in BCR-ABL positive mice with associated
normalizations of Gr1+ and Ter119+ cell populations.
However, phenotypic LT-HSCs were spared by dasatinib
and their fraction increased. This finding closely reflects
reports in CML patients and patient-derived immature
CD34+CD38- cells that CML stem cells are spared by
treatment with TKIs, including dasatinib [28, 31, 32].
To evaluate the occurrence of dasatinib-associated
pleural effusion, pulmonary artery hypertension, or colitis,
we analyzed the effects on different organs, focusing on the
lung and the small intestine, but no evidence for dasatinib
induced alterations of the lung or colon were observed.
This may have been due to the short duration of dasatinib
treatment or to fundamental differences in murine and
human immune effects. Nevertheless, dasatinib strongly
counteracted BCR-ABL induced granulocytic infiltration
of the small intestinal mucosa (Figure 6).
In conclusion, we demonstrate that dasatinib
strongly antagonizes BCR-ABL induced effects in vivo
in a transgenic mouse model of chronic phase-CML,
but had differential effects on hematopoiesis in wt
mice. Short-term exposure to dasatinib did not induce
significant LGL lymphocytosis, pleural effusion or signs
of pulmonary artery hypertension. This mouse model is
useful to investigate short-term effects of dasatinib and
TKI resistance but may also be utilized for assessment of
the mechanisms of long-term effects of CML treatment.

of BCR-ABL is induced by withdrawal of tetracycline from
the drinking water.
Using 8 week old FVB/N wild-type animals
purchased from Janvier Labs (France) that were male/
female and age matched, two doses of dasatinib were
tested, with 5 mg/kg vs. 20 mg/kg dasatinib (provided
by Bristol-Myers Squibb) being administered by oral
gavage for 14 days. For transplantation experiments,
bone marrow (BM) of 4 mice that had been offset from
tetracycline for seven days, was pooled and transplanted
1x106 cells (2.5x105 BCR-ABL positive cells; 7.5x105
single-transgenic control cells) into irradiated (10 Gy)
FVB/N CD45.2+ recipient mice. Afterwards, the disease
phenotype was assessed by regular blood counts and
flow-cytometric analysis for Gr1/CD11b+ cells. After 15
weeks of induction, oral gavage treatment with 20 mg/
kg dasatinb or control vehicle (80 mM citric acid stock
solution (pH 2.1) in 80 mM citrate buffer (pH 3.1)) was
begun and performed for 10 days. The SCLtTAxBCRABL mouse strain expresses CD45.1, therefore allowing
distinction between donor (CD45.1) and recipient
(CD45.2) hematopoiesis.
In another approach BCR-ABL, expression was
induced in single-transgenic (stg) control and doubletransgenic (dtg) BCR-ABL positive animals, and the mice
were treated daily with 20 mg/kg dasatinib for survival
analysis. In another cohort of mice, the effect of dasatinb
in dtg mice was analyzed after 7 days of treatment.
All animal experiments were approved by the
local authorities of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
(Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz
NRW).

Dasatinib treatment
Two different batches of dasatinib obtained from
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) were used. For the first
experiment, dasatinib was dissolved in DMSO, diluted in
80 mM citrate buffer (pH 3.1), and used in comparison
with citrate buffer with 5% DMSO (vehicle control). The
other batch was prepared as a 30 mg/ml stock solution by
sonication in 80 mM citric acid stock solution (pH 2.1).
This stock was renewed every five days and diluted daily
in 80 mM citrate buffer (pH 3.1) before dosing. Dasatinib
was applied once daily with 5 or 20 mg/kg or citrate buffer
vehicle by oral gavage. Both batches produced comparable
results.

cells were lysed with ammonium-chloride-potassium
buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 1 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.3) prior to incubation with the appropriate
FACS antibodies. The following antibodies were used for
the phenotyping of the immune cells by FACS analysis:
Gr1, CD45.1, B220, CD4, CD11b, CD8, Ter-119, CD3,
NK1.1 (Biolegend, Fell, Germany), CD41 (eBioscience,
Frankfurt, Germany), CD49b (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg,
Germany). 1x106 cells were stained for 15 minutes on ice
and washed with PBS/FCS.
For stem- and progenitor cell analysis, cells were
stained for lineage positive cells with tricolor- or PECy5 labeled CD4, CD8a, B220 (life technologies,
Germany) CD3 (BD Bioscience), Gr1, Ter-119, CD11b
(Biolegend). Lineage negative cells were further
characterized by CD48, CD150, c-kit (Biolegend) and
Sca-1 (biotin labeled first antibody and streptavidin PeCy7 labeled secondary antibody, BD Bioscience) for
the stem cell compartment, and CD127, c-kit, CD34
(Biolegend), CD16/32 (BD Bioscience) and Sca-1
for progenitor staining. FACS measurements were
conducted with a FACS Gallios (Beckman Coulter,
Krefeld, Germany) and analyzed with Kaluza Software
(Version 1.3) or FlowJo (Version 10).

GraphPadPrism software was used for the statistical
analysis. The two-tailed Student’s t-test or WilcoxonMann-Whitney-test were performed, defining significant
differences as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Mean
and standard deviation (SD) are indicated.
