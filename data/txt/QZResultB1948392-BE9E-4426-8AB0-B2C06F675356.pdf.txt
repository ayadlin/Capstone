Killing Tumor Cells Through Their
Surface b2-Microglobulin or Major
Histocompatibility Complex Class I
Molecules
Jing Yang, PhD and Qing Yi, MD, PhD

Targeted antibody-based therapy has been used successfully to treat cancers. Recent studies have demonstrated
that tumor cells treated with antibodies specific for b2-microglobulin (b2M) or major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I molecules undergo apoptosis in vitro and in vivo (mouse models). Antibodies against b2M or MHC class
I induce tumor cell apoptosis by 1) recruiting MHC class I molecules to lipid rafts and activating LYN kinase and the
signal-transducing enzyme phospholipase C-c2-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and 2) expelling interleukin 6 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors out of lipid rafts and inhibiting the growth and survival factor-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-related kinase pathways.
Consequently, mitochondrial integrity is compromised, and the caspase-9-dependent cascade is activated in treated
tumor cells. However, although b2M and MHC class I are expressed on normal hematopoietic cells, which is a potential
safety concern, the monoclonal antibodies were selective to tumor cells and did not damage normal cells in vitro or
in human-like mouse models. These findings suggest that targeting b2M or MHC class I by using antibodies or other
agents offers a potential therapeutic approach for b2M/MHC class I-expressing malignancies. Cancer 2010;116:1638–

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules consist of a 45-kD a-chain that contains domain a1,

domain a2, immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain a3, and an 11.6-kD light chain called b2-microglobulin (b2M). The
a1 and a2 domains of the a-chain are polymorphic. Their polymorphisms frequently occur in 3 hypervariable regions
that form the antigen-binding cleft or peptide-binding region, which is recognized by the T-cell receptor on CD8-positive T lymphocytes. Domain a3 contains a conserved, 7-amino-acid loop that binds with CD8 molecules.1,2 b2M is a
nonglycosylated polypeptide composed of 100 amino acids. Its best characterized function is to interact with and stabilize the tertiary structure of the a-chain.3 Because it is associated noncovalently with the a-chain, it can be exchanged
with the circulating form of b2M, which is present at low levels in serum, urine, and other body fluids under
physiologic conditions.4
b2M/MHC class I molecules are present on almost all normal nucleated cells and on most tumor cells, although the
levels of expression may differ among different cells.5 Although some solid tumors express a low density of b2M/MHC
class I molecules on their surface6,7 to escape host immune surveillance,8,9 overexpression of b2M/MHC class I molecules
also has been reported on other tumors, including hematologic malignancies.10 Thus, these molecules are potential targets
of antibody-based therapy for b2M/MHC class I-positive tumors.11,12

Killing Tumor Cells by MHC Class 1/Yang and Yi

MHC Class I as Signaling Molecules
MHC class I molecules are important signal-transducing
molecules involved in the finely tuned regulation of
immune responses. Ligation of MHC class I molecules on
T and B cells by immobilized antibodies or secondary
cross-linking triggers signal transduction, which is
involved in responses ranging from anergy and apoptosis
to cell proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production.13-17 Cross-linking MHC class I activates several
intracellular signaling pathways, including 1) phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases, leading to a rise in the intracellular free calcium concentration; 2) activation of the Janus
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription
(JAK/STAT) pathway, resulting in STAT3 activation;
and 3) up-regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K), leading to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation.13-17 However, it remains unclear which part of
MHC class I molecules transmits the signals. The cytoplasmic domain of the MHC class I a-chain has a tyrosine
320 residue, which can be phosphorylated and forms a
signaling motif. However, previous studies have demonstrated that deletion of all but the 4 proximal amino acids
from the cytoplasmic tail does not alter their signal-transduction capabilities,18 and truncated molecules still are
able to synergize with CD3, CD2, or CD28 to initiate IL2 production.19,20 Conversely, others have demonstrated
that MHC class I molecules are associated physically with
some hormone or growth factor receptors, such as insulin
receptor, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), IL-2 receptor, IL4 receptor, and glucagon receptors on cell surfaces,21-26
suggesting that MHC class I-induced signaling may be
transmitted through these receptors. Taken together,
these findings indicate that, in addition to antigen presentation, MHC class I molecules or their components play
an important role in the regulation of immune responses
through MHC class I-mediated signaling.
MHC Class I Molecules as Inducers of
Cell Apoptosis
In past decades, antibodies that target surface MHC class
I molecules on various cell types were generated and investigated. Genestier et al reported that 2 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (mouse MoAb90 and rat YTH862) that
bind epitopes of the a1 domain of the a-chain induced
apoptosis in activated, but not resting, T lymphocytes27
and CD40-activated B lymphocytes.28 Another MoAb, a
rat MoAb RE2 that bound with the a2 domain of the achain, induced apoptosis in activated murine lymphocytes

that involved caspase cascade and PI3K activation.29
Others reported that a murine MoAb (5H7) specific for
the a3 domain, but not for other MoAbs (TI2599, a3 domain-specific; W6/32, binding with both a2 and a3),
could induce growth inhibition and apoptosis of B-cell–
derived tumor cell lines.30,31 However, secondary crosslinking of the MoAb was required, because only plasticimmobilized, but not soluble, 5H7 MoAb was able to kill
the cells.30,31
Antibodies Against Surface b2M Are
Therapeutic Against Hematologic
Malignancies
Elevated levels of circulating b2M, present in patients who
have hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma,32 lymphomas,33 and leukemias,34 are 1 of several
important predictive factors in these patients that may
indicate aggressive disease and a poor prognosis.35 Previous studies have demonstrated that release of b2M into
surrounding tissues may contribute to the induction of
bone absorption in patients with myeloma36 by inducing
osteoclast formation. In addition, b2M may induce osteoblast secretion of IL-637 and promote fibroblast production of matrix metalloproteinase 1,38 both of which
support tumor growth and bone destruction. Thus, the
findings indicate that targeting b2M may help control tumor growth and bone destruction in these malignancies.
Our recent studies indicated that anti-b2M MoAbs
induce programmed death of hematologic malignant
cells.39 We used a commercially available anti-b2M
MoAb B2 and MoAbs D1 and E6 made in our own laboratory and demonstrated that these MoAbs have potent in
vitro tumoricidal activity against all 14 b2M/MHC class
I-expressing multiple myeloma, Burkitt lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, T-cell, and myelogenous leukemia cell
lines that were tested and against primary tumor cells isolated from patients with myeloma. Tumor cell death
occurred rapidly without the need for exogenous immunologic effector mechanisms or secondary cross-linking.
Although the expression of b2M on normal hematopoietic
cells is a potential safety concern, the MoAbs seemed to be
selective to tumor-transformed cells and did not induce
apoptosis of normal cells, including T and B lymphocytes
and CD34-positive bone marrow stem cells. Furthermore, the MoAbs were able to kill myeloma cells selectively without damaging normal stromal cells in their
cocultures. After binding to the cell surface, the MoAbs
mediated the internalization and down-modulation of
surface b2M and MHC class I molecules. The MoAbs

1639

Review Article

induced cell death by up-regulating Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death (Bad) and Bcl-2-associated X protein
(Bax) expression, inducing phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and
decreasing phosphorylation of Bad, all of which compromised mitochondrial integrity, leading to cytochrome c
release into cytosol and activation of the caspase-9-dependent cascade. Inhibitors of pan-caspases or caspase-9,
but not of caspase-8, prevented anti-b2M MoAb-mediated tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, the knockdown of
surface b2M by b2M-specific small inhibitory RNAs
decreased the expression of MHC class I molecules on tumor cells and consequently abrogated apoptosis of tumor
cells induced by the MoAbs. Furthermore, our studies
demonstrated that anti-b2M MoAbs also are active and
therapeutic in vivo. After subcutaneous or intraperitoneal
injections, the MoAbs significantly reduced tumor burdens and retarded tumor growth in xenografted severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice with human
myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia cell lines and in
SCID-hu mice that were inoculated with primary myeloma cells isolated from patients. These findings indicate
that anti-b2M MoAbs are a potential novel therapeutic
approach to treating hematologic malignancies that
express surface b2M/MHC class I molecules.
For future clinical application of the MoAbs as a
therapeutic agent, a major concern is whether anti-b2M
MoAbs will be therapeutic and safe for treating cancer
patients in whom every tissue expresses low densities of
MHC class I molecules and elevated levels of soluble b2M
are present. To address this concern, we recently developed and used a myeloma-human leukemic antigen-A2
(HLA-A2)-transgenic nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID
mouse model.40 The mice were transgenic for HLA-A2 achain but not for human b2M. However, with established
myeloma, all murine tissues expressed human HLA-A2
and b2M, and high levels of circulating human b2M,
which are observed in most patients with myeloma, were
detected, indicating that myeloma-derived human b2M
forms mature MHC class I molecules with the HLA-A2
a-chain on murine cells. Moreover, the human MHC
class I molecules on murine cells are functional. We
observed that anti-b2M MoAbs effectively suppressed
myeloma growth in these mice, activated caspase-9 and
caspase-3, and induced myeloma cell apoptosis in vivo.
Although the MoAbs can be detected on different organs,
including the heart, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney, no tissue damage or cell apoptosis or associated caspase activation was observed in the mice.40 Moreover, treatment
with anti-b2M MoAbs did not change the body weight of

1640

the mice or impair the implanted human bones in SCIDhu mice.39
We also evaluated whether the therapeutic effects of
the MoAbs would be compromised by b2M/MHC class
I-expressing normal cells by using in vitro cocultures that
contained myeloma cells and 5-fold more b2M/MHC
class I-expressing normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs). We observed that anti-b2M MoAbs killed
myeloma cells with the same efficiency whether or not
they were surrounded and outnumbered by normal cells
expressing human b2M/MHC class I. In addition,
although bone marrow stromal cells, such as osteoclasts,
promote tumor growth and protect myeloma cells from
apoptosis in vitro, MoAb-induced myeloma cell apoptosis
was not protected in the cocultures with osteoclasts.39
Furthermore, the addition of higher molar concentrations
of soluble b2M (50-100 lg/mL), which were 3-fold to
10-fold higher than concentrations in patients with myeloma, in the culture of myeloma cells did not abrogate
the apoptosis-inducing effects of the MoAbs on myeloma.39 These findings strongly suggest that anti-b2M
MoAbs may be efficacious and that their therapeutic
effects in cancer patients may not be compromised by
tissue-expressed and soluble b2M.
We have carefully examined the potential toxicity of
anti-b2M MoAbs on normal hematopoietic cells. Normal
PBMCs, resting and activated CD3-positive T cells and
CD19-positive B cells, CD16-positive natural killer (NK)
cells, and bone marrow CD34-positive stem cells were
treated with the MoAbs and were resistant to the MoAbinduced apoptosis.39 However, Smith et al reported that
treatment with 5H7, a MoAb specific for the a3 domain
of MHC class I molecules, caused suppression of T cellmediated cellular immunity in vivo.31 To investigate the
possibility that anti-b2M MoAbs would trigger potential
immunologic consequences by binding to and blocking
MHC class I on normal cells, we examined whether the
MoAbs could induce NK cells to kill normal cells coated
with the MoAbs in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that NK cells did not lyse PBMCs that were pretreated with or without the MoAb or IgG1. However,
these NK cells efficiently killed K562 cells. Furthermore,
no cell apoptosis or tissue damage was observed in human
bone marrow tissues after immunohistochemical examination of human marrow cells from SCID-hu mice in
which anti-b2M MoAb and, subsequently, purified
human NK cells were injected directly into the implanted
human bones.39 Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo
toxicity data from humanized mouse models provide

strong evidence that targeting b2M using MoAbs would
have limited direct toxicity if this approach were translated into a therapeutic strategy despite the ubiquitous
expression of b2M and class I MHC on the majority of tissues. However, there is a possibility that, by blocking b2M
or MHC class I molecules, these MoAbs could inhibit
MHC class I antigen presentation and induce immunosuppression. This possibility needs to be investigated.
Similar results have been reported from other
MoAb-based therapies for cancers, such as anti-EGFR
MoAbs, including cetuximab, panitummab, and matuzumab.41,42 Anti-EGFR MoAbs effectively eradicate tumor
cells and are used currently in the treatment of several
solid cancers.41 Like human b2M/MHC class I molecules,
EGFR is widely expressed by normal cells of epithelial,
mesenchymal, and neuronal origin,41 and anti-EGFR
MoAbs still have low toxicity on these normal cells. This
may be caused in part by overexpression of the antigens in
tumor cells,39,41 because our results and studies by others
have indicated that myeloma cells express significantly
higher levels of surface b2M than normal cells.39,43 In
addition, the ability of MoAbs to cross-link b2M/MHC
class I molecules and MoAb-mediated intracellular signaling pathways may be different on normal cells, which may
contribute to normal cell resistance to MoAb-induced apoptosis. Indeed, our studies demonstrated that the MoAbs
did not recruit MHC class I molecules to lipid rafts or
activate the downstream apoptotic signaling pathways in
normal B cells.39 Nevertheless, because this is an important issue for future clinical application, further study will
be needed to examine the potential toxicity in nonhuman
primates using humanized MoAbs against b2M or MHC
class I molecules.
In addition to naturally generated MoAbs, Sekimoto and colleagues recently developed a recombinant,
single-chain Fv diabody (2D7-DB) specific to the a2 domain of HLA-A and demonstrated that 2D7-DB specifically induced myeloma cell death in the bone marrow
environment.44 The diabody rapidly induced Rho-mediated actin aggregation in a caspase-independent death
pathway in myeloma cells without damaging normal bone
marrow cells. Furthermore, the diabody synergized with
interferon-c and chemotherapy drugs (melphalan or bortezomib) in killing myeloma cells.44 It is noteworthy that
the single-chain diabody lacks an Fc fragment, so that it
cannot bind or activate immune effector molecules or cells
such as complements or NK cells, and it will not be able
to damage normal cells by mediating complement-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular cyto-

toxicity. Thus, targeting surface b2M/MHC class I
molecules may be a novel therapeutic approach against
hematologic malignancies.
Antibodies Against Surface b2M Induce
Apoptosis in Solid Tumors
The overexpression of surface b2M/MHC class I molecules also was detected in some types of solid tumors,
including prostate cancer,43 renal cell carcinoma,45,46 gastrointestinal cancer,47 lung cancer, and breast cancer.48,49
Previous studies have indicated that increased b2M
expression linked to increased tumor growth and
enhanced migration and invasion of breast cancer, lung
cancer, and renal cell carcinoma45 and surface b2M can be
regarded as a signaling and growth-promoting factor for
prostate cancer and cancer-associated bone metastasis.43,50 It is noteworthy that both polyclonal antibodies
and MoAbs specific for surface b2M had strong tumoricidal activity in prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma.51
The treatment of several renal cell carcinoma lines with
anti-b2M antibodies strongly suppressed the growth and
induced apoptosis of these cells in vitro in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner.52 In addition, Huang
and colleagues demonstrated that the downstream signaling pathways of surface b2M/MHC class I directly regulate the expression of androgen receptor, a prostate cancer
survival factor, and its target gene prostate-specific antigen
in prostate cancer.53 Anti-b2M antibodies inhibited the
growth and induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by
interrupting b2M-mediated androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen expression.53 These studies indicate
that targeting surface b2M also may be a novel and promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of b2M/MHC
class I-positive solid tumors.
Ligation of b2M/MHC Class I With Antibodies
Activates Apoptotic Pathways Through Lipid
Rafts in Tumor Cells
Studies have demonstrated that b2M/MHC class I molecules possess the ability to regulate receptor-mediated
transmembrane signal transduction.11,54,55 Ligation of
b2M/MHC class I molecules with antibodies induced
clustering, capping, and internalization of MHC class I
molecules and activation of several intracellular signaling
pathways in normal cells.13-17 Consequently, phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases led to a rise in the concentration
of intracellular free calcium, activation of the JAK/
STAT3 pathway,13 and up-regulated the activity of PI3K
and JNK.17 In tumor cells, ligation of MHC class I

molecules with specific antibodies induced apoptotic signaling pathways by stimulating the phosphorylation of
the kinases apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK),
mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), and mitogen-activated
protein (MAP)/extracellular response kinase kinase 1
(MEKK1); up-regulating MAP kinase kinase 4/7
(MKK4/7) activity; and activating JNK. In vitro pretreatment of cells with JNK inhibitor completely abrogated
anti-b2M MoAb-induced apoptosis, and injection of JNK
inhibitor in vivo reduced MoAb-mediated tumoricidal
effects on established tumor cells in SCID mouse models.
Moreover, anti-b2M MoAbs disrupted IL-6-stimulated or
IGF-1-stimulated Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in myeloma cells.39,55 Different from Fas/
Fas ligand-induced caspase-8 activation, treatment of

1642

tumor cells with anti-b2M MoAbs compromised
mitochondrial integrity and activated caspase-9-dependent apoptotic cascades.39,56,57
Our studies also have implicated lipid rafts as important mediators for anti-b2M MoAb-induced apoptosis in
tumor cells. Lipid rafts, which are cholesterol-enriched
and glycosphingolipid-enriched dynamic patches in the
plasma membrane of cells, organize plasma membrane
into functional units. Accumulating evidence has suggested that lipid rafts act as platforms to transduce signals
into cells for various functions58 and are involved in antiMHC class II and anti-CD20 MoAb-induced apoptosis
of tumor cells.59,60 Under physiologic conditions, some
MHC class II molecules are present in lipid rafts, and
more of the molecules are located within lipid rafts after
treatment with anti-MHC class II MoAbs. Such relocalization of MHC class II molecules seems to be critical for
anti-HLA-DR MoAb-mediated tumor cell apoptosis.
Nagy and Mooney demonstrated that MHC class II-specific MoAbs mediated signaling events and pathologic
changes on tumor cells by recruiting MHC class II molecules into lipid rafts and localizing actin and protein kinase C (PKC) to the rafts, which, in turn, activated PKC
and its potential targets, leading to tumor cell apoptosis.61
Different from MHC class II molecules, MHC class I
molecules are present outside lipid rafts under physiologic
conditions. However, after treatment with anti-b2M
MoAbs, MHC class I molecules on myeloma cells were
recruited into lipid rafts, leading to the activation of src
family tyrosine Lyn kinase and phospholipase C c2.39 In
contrast, neither MHC class I molecules nor Lyn were
associated with lipid rafts in normal B cells that were
treated with or without anti-b2M MoAbs, which may
explain in part the selectivity of anti-b2M MoAbs against
malignant cells but not normal cells. In addition, anti-b2M
MoAbs also affected the raft distribution of growth factor
receptors in tumor cells. It has been reported that growth
and survival factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-1, stimulate
growth signaling and confer protection against chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis caused by the translocation of
their receptors into lipid rafts.62 We observed that anti-b2M
MoAb binding to surface b2M/MHC class I molecules not
only recruits MHC class I molecules into lipid rafts but also
expels growth factor (IL-6 and IGF-1) receptors out of lipid
rafts,56 thereby disrupting their signaling pathways. Myeloma cells that were treated with methyl-b-cyclodextrin, an
agent that disrupts the structure of lipid rafts in the cell membrane, no longer were sensitive to anti-b2M MoAb-induced
apoptosis. These observations further confirm the association

and importance of MHC class I and lipid rafts in anti-b2M
MoAb-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells (Fig. 1).
Summary and Conclusions
Taken together, the current review indicates that antibodies against b2M/MHC class I molecules exhibited tumoricidal activity against several tumor cell lines through
surface b2M/MHC class I molecules and their associated
proapoptotic signaling pathways in preclinical studies.
Targeting b2M/MHC class I molecules has significant
advantages in the treatment of b2M/MHC class I-expressing tumors, because these MoAbs had remarkably strong
tumoricidal activities and were effective in killing all
b2M/MHC class I-expressing hematologic malignant cells
examined without the need for exogenous immunologic
effector mechanisms. The MoAbs were able to kill chemotherapy-refractory myeloma in vitro and, more noteworthy, led to tumor regression in xenograft mouse models
of myeloma and other hematologic cancers without
damaging normal cells and tissues. Furthermore, their
therapeutic efficacy was not counteracted by the high concentrations of soluble b2M and tissue-expressing b2M/
MHC class I. Although the animal models that we
reviewed suggest that normal cells expressing MHC class I
and soluble b2M do not significantly impair the efficacy
of anti-b2M antibodies, this still may limit application of
this therapeutic strategy in patients who have high levels
of circulating b2M. The potential for immunosuppression
caused by the blockade of surface b2M or MHC class I
molecules requires further study before this approach can
be translated into a clinical strategy.
