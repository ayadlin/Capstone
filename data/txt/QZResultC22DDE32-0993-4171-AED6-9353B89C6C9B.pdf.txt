ABSTRACT:
The promise of PARP-inhibitors(PARPis) in the management of epithelial
ovarian cancer(EOC) is tempered by the fact that approximately 50% of patients
with homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors do not respond well to
these agents. Combination of PARPis with agents that inhibit HR may represent
an effective strategy to enhance their activity in HR-proficient tumors. Using a
bioinformatics approach, we identified that heat shock protein 90 inhibitors(HSP90i)
may suppress HR and thus revert HR-proficient to HR-deficient tumors. Analysis
of publicly available gene expression data showed that exposure of HR-proficient
breast cancer cell lines to HSP90i 17-AAG(17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)
downregulated HR, ATM and Fanconi Anemia pathways. In HR-proficient EOC cells,
17-AAG suppressed HR as assessed using the RAD51 foci formation assay and this was
further confirmed using the Direct Repeat-GFP reporter assay. Furthermore, 17-AAG
downregulated BRCA1 and/or RAD51 protein levels, and induced significantly more
γH2AX activation in combination with olaparib compared to olaparib alone. Finally,
sublethal concentrations of 17-AAG sensitized HR-proficient EOC lines to olaparib
and carboplatin but did not affect sensitivity of the HR-deficient OVCAR8 line arguing
that the 17-AAG mediated sensitization is dependent on suppression of HR. These
results provide a preclinical rationale for using a combination of olaparib/17-AAG in
HR-proficient EOC.

INTRODUCTION

sensitive to platinum analogues and other cytotoxic drugs
that induce double strand DNA breaks which are normally
repaired by HR. These tumors are also highly sensitive to
poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPis), a novel
class of anticancer agents, which exhibit synthetic lethality
in tumors with defective HR pathway [3-5]. PARPis have
shown striking activity in HR-deficient EOC tumors both
in the presence [6-8] and in the absence of BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutations [9, 10]. Of these agents, olaparib has
been the most widely studied PARPi and is currently in the

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized
by frequent genetic and epigenetic alterations in gene
members of the homologous recombination (HR)
DNA repair pathway. In particular, approximately
50% of high grade serous cancers harbor molecular
alterations in the HR pathway which include germline
and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations in 15% and 6-7% of
them respectively [1, 2]. HR deficient tumors are highly

most advanced stage of clinical development [6, 7, 9-11].
The promise of PARP inhibitors in the management
of EOC is tempered by the fact that HR-proficient EOCs
do not respond well to these agents, suggesting that the
remaining approximately 50% of EOC patients (i.e. those
without HR alterations) do not benefit from this novel
class of drugs. Combination of PARPis with agents that
inhibit HR may represent an effective strategy to enhance
activity of PARPis in HR proficient tumors and thus
potentially expand use of these agents beyond patients
with HR deficient EOCs.
In order to identify candidate agents that may
directly or indirectly inhibit HR, we used the Connectivity
Map, a reference collection of gene expression signatures
that have been generated by exposing cultured human
cell lines to a variety of small molecule drugs[12, 13].
By matching gene expression signatures of disease
states or physiological processes with gene expression
signatures of small molecule drugs, the Connectivity Map
has successfully unraveled novel functional associations

between small molecules sharing a mechanism of action,
chemicals and physiological processes, and diseases
and drugs. Here, we report that, using the Connectivity
Map we identified heat shock protein 90 inhibitors
(HSP90i) as candidate drugs that suppress HR, and then
confirmed experimentally that an HSP90i 17-AAG[14,
15] suppresses HR pathway, and enhances sensitivity to
platinum and PARPis in HR proficient ovarian cancer
cells.

RESULTS
Connectivity Map identifies HSP90is as candidate
compounds that suppress HR
We queried a previously developed gene expression
signature of BRCAness[16] to the Connectivity Map in
order to identify matching gene expression signatures
of small molecule drugs (Figure 1A). Because of the

potential association of the BRCAness gene expression
signature with defective HR, we hypothesized that drugs
identified via the Connectivity Map whose gene expression
signatures are similar to the BRCAness signature may be
functionally associated with induction of defective HR and
thus reversion of HR proficient to HR deficient tumors.
Application of the top performing genes of the
BRCAness signature to the Connectivity Map identified
a number of interesting compounds (Figure 1B) with
high connectivity scores across several cell lines included
in the Connectivity Map (Figure 1C). Of note, the two
highest performing compounds, which were consistently
identified using various cut-offs for the top performing
genes of BRCAness signature, were geldanamycin and
alvespimycin, both HSP90 inhibitors. This finding raised
the possibility of a functional relationship between HSP90
inhibition and induction of deficient HR. In this regard,
as predicted by the Connectivity Map, we hypothesized
that these agents might enhance PARPi and platinum
sensitivity by suppressing HR (either directly or indirectly)
thereby suggesting that HSP90is may have an off-target
class effect involving the HR pathway.

the expression levels of several genes of these pathways
were decreased upon exposure to 17-AAG (Table 1).
Conversely, in the HR deficient (MBA-MD-436, HCC1937 and UACC3199) breast cancer cell lines, 17-AAG
did not significantly affect any of these pathways (p value
non significant for all 3 aforementioned pathways).

Sublethal concentrations of 17-AAG suppress HR
in HR proficient ovarian cancer cell lines
RAD51 is involved in HR, and formation of nuclear
RAD51 foci after IR has been used as a surrogate of
effective HR DNA repair. We evaluated the functional
impact of 17-AAG on HR in HR proficient ovarian cancer
cell lines using the RAD51 foci formation after ionizing
radiation (IR) assay. As shown in Figure 2A-2D, sublethal
concentrations of 17-AAG (as determined by 17-AAG
dose response curves that were obtained for each ovarian
cancer cell line, Supplementary Figure 1) had a significant
impact on RAD51 foci after IR causing approximately
70% reduction in foci formation in 36M2 and SKOV3
cells.
To further confirm the results of the RAD51 foci
formation assay we used the Direct Repeat-GFP (DRGFP) reporter system previously developed to assay HR
in mammalian cells [17, 18]. DR-GFP is an integrated
fluorescence-based reporter that allows for the efficient
quantification of HR at a single, targeted DSB by flow
cytometry or immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown
in Figure 2E, 17-AAG diminished HR-mediated DSB
repair in a dose dependent fashion.

17-AAG downregulates HR pathway and gene
expression in HR proficient but not HR deficient
cells
Given that the Connectivity Map identified HSP90is
as candidate agents that suppress HR, we evaluated
whether the transcriptional response to HSP90is affects
HR pathway and HR pathway genes in cancer cell lines.
We queried GEO for publicly available gene expression
data of response to HSP90is and identified one microarray
dataset assessing the transcriptional response of breast
cancer cell lines to HSP90i 17-AAG (17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin). 17-AAG is an HSP90 inhibitor
that has been evaluated in clinical trials in various
malignancies, and is currently in the most advanced stage
of clinical development of all HSP90is. Furthermore,
unlike geldanamycin, it is not hepatotoxic and is therefore
appropriate for clinical use.
This microarray dataset included gene expression
data of the HR proficient (Hs578T, MCF-7, MDAMB-157, T47D and MDA-MB-231) and HR deficient
(MBA-MD-436, HCC-1937 and UACC3199) breast
cancer cell lines exposed to 17-AAG or control. We
assessed 17-AAG induced changes in the expression
levels of genes of the HR pathway both at an individual
gene level and at a global pathway level.
Strikingly, in the HR proficient breast cancer cell
lines, pathway analysis revealed that exposure to 17-AAG
statistically significantly downregulated HR (p<0.005),
ATM (p=0.015) signaling and Fanconi Anemia (p<0.005)
pathways, which are involved in repair of double strand
breaks and interstrand crosslinks (Table 1). Furthermore,

17-AAG downregulates RAD51 and/or BRCA1
protein levels in ovarian cancer cells
We evaluated whether 17-AAG downregulates HR
pathway genes in HR proficient ovarian cancer cell lines
as predicted by the microarray data in the breast cancer
cell lines (Table 1). For this purpose, we performed
Western blot of two representative HR pathway genes,
RAD51 and BRCA1 that were found to be downregulated
upon exposure to 17-AAG in HR proficient cells (Table 1).
As shown in Figure 3A, 17-AAG downregulated protein
levels of BRCA1 and RAD51 in 36M2 and RAD51 alone
in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines.

Sublethal concentrations of 17-AAG combined
with olaparib induce γH2AX activation more than
olaparib alone in ovarian cancer cells
Having demonstrated that 17-AAG functionally
inhibits HR, we determined whether 17-AAG could
sensitize ovarian cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of
PARPi olaparib. We first assessed γH2Ax activation which

is a surrogate of DNA damage and a marker of cytotoxicity
of ovarian cancer cells. Specifically, we examined whether
γH2AX expression was enhanced by the combination of
17-AAG and olaparib compared to olaparib alone. As
shown in Figure 3B, we confirmed enhanced γH2AX
expression in the HR proficient ovarian cancer cells 36M2
and SKOV3 treated with sublethal concentrations of 17AAG in combination with olaparib compared to olaparib
alone.

that 17-AAG also enhanced sensitivity to the combination
of olaparib and carboplatin. Of note, for both OVCAR5
and 36M2 cells, we were able to detect significant killing
with very low olaparib and carboplatin doses, i.e. as low
as 2.5uM (Supplementary Figure 2).

17-AAG sensitizes HR proficient ovarian cancer
cell lines to olaparib and carboplatin in vitro

We previously showed that 17-AAG suppresses
HR and enhances sensitivity of HR proficient cell lines
to olaparib and carboplatin. In order to evaluate the effect
of 17-AAG in HR deficient ovarian cancer cells, we used
the OVCAR8 cell line which harbors almost undetectable
levels of BRCA1 protein (Figure 5A) and very low levels
of BRCA1 transcript (Figure 5B) compared to 36M2
ovarian cancer line. As shown in Figure 5C, sublethal
concentrations of 17-AAG did not sensitize OVCAR8
cells to olaparib or carboplatin.

17-AAG does not sensitize HR deficient OVCAR8
cell line to olaparib and carboplatin in vitro

In order to assess whether 17-AAG induces
sensitivity to olaparib we used only sublethal doses of
17-AAG as determined in the dose responses curves in
each cell line (Supplementary Figure 1). As shown in
Figure 4A, sublethal concentrations of 17-AAG were
associated with increased sensitivity of HR proficient
cell lines SKOV3, OVCAR5 and 36M2 cells to olaparib.
Furthermore, exposure of these HR proficient ovarian
cancer cell lines to sublethal concentrations of 17-AAG
also enhanced sensitivity to carboplatin (Figure 4B).
Finally, viability assays with a combination of three drugs,
olaparib, carboplatin, and 17-AAG, in HR-proficient
ovarian cancer cell lines (36M2 and OVCAR5) showed

DISCUSSION
Although platinum analogues and PARPis exhibit
striking activity in HR deficient EOCs, HR proficient
tumors do not respond well to these agents. Furthermore,

acquired resistance to PARPis in HR deficient EOCs
frequently occurs via restoration of HR; for example,
BRCA1/2-mutated EOCs become HR proficient via
secondary BRCA1/2 mutations that restore BRCA1/2
function and lead to PARPi and platinum resistance [1923]. Therefore, combination of PARPis with agents that
inhibit HR may represent an effective strategy to enhance
activity of PARPis in EOCs that are HR proficient either
at baseline or at the time of development of platinum or
PARPi resistance. In this regard, CDK1 inhibitors and
PI3K inhibitors, which inhibit HR, have been shown to
sensitize HR proficient cells to PARP inhibitors [24, 25].
In this study, we used a unique bioinformatics
approach to identify novel candidate agents that have the
potential to suppress HR and thus revert HR proficient
to HR deficient tumors. Application of our previously
developed, publicly available, BRCAness signature to the
Connectivity Map consistently identified HSP90is as the
highest performing compounds, thus raising the possibility
of a functional relationship between HSP90 inhibition and
induction of HR deficiency. To test this hypothesis, we
first accessed publicly available microarray data of the
transcriptional response of cancer cell lines to the HSP90i
17-AAG, and found that exposure to 17-AAG statistically
significantly downregulated HR, ATM and Fanconi
Anemia signaling pathways both at the level of the
pathway and at the level of individual genes. Interestingly,
this effect was only evident in the HR-proficient but not
in HR-deficient breast cancer cells. We then confirmed
experimentally that 17-AAG functionally suppressed HR
pathway using both the DR-GFP reporter and RAD51
foci formation assays after IR. Of note, even sublethal
concentrations of 17-AAG had a significant functional
impact on HR causing approximately 70% reduction in
RAD51 foci formation in HR proficient ovarian cancer
cell lines. Importantly, 17-AAG decreased BRCA1 and
RAD51 protein levels in HR proficient EOC cells.
Given that 17-AAG suppressed HR, we assessed
whether 17-AAG would sensitize EOC cells to platinum
and PARPis. Indeed, we showed that the combination of
sublethal concentrations of 17-AAG with olaparib induced
greater DNA damage (assessed by γH2AX expression)
compared to olaparib alone. Furthermore, sublethal
concentrations of 17-AAG enhanced cytotoxicity of HR
proficient EOC cells to carboplatin and olaparib. Of note,
17-AAG also enhanced sensitivity to the combination
of olaparib and carboplatin inducing significant killing
even with very low olaparib and carboplatin doses
(Supplementary Figure 2). Conversely, 17-AAG did not
enhance cytotoxicity of the HR deficient OVCAR8 cell
line to carboplatin and olaparib. This finding strongly
suggests that the 17-AAG induced sensitization to olaparib
and carboplatin is related to suppression of HR and not due
to another (HR-independent) mechanism. Although our
data suggest that 17-AAG suppresses HR and sensitizes
to olaparib and carboplatin in vitro, we would like to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recognize that 17-AAG-induced sensitization to platinum
and PARP-inhibitors need to be further confirmed using
in vivo models.
It is important to underscore that the 17-AAG doses
of 10-100nM that were used in our experiments were
sublethal in the ovarian cancer cell lines employed in our
study although they are reportedly fully cytostatic in other
settings (Ref. 26-28). One reason may be because HSP90inhibitors induce HSP70 (a known pharmacodynamic
marker of 17-AAG therapy) which bears anti-apoptotic
effects [26-28]. Therefore, 17-AAG may exert dual effects
on cell death that is cell-context-dependent and dependent
on drug combinations [26].
In conclusion, sublethal concentrations of the
HSP90i 17-AAG suppress HR and enhance sensitivity
of HR proficient ovarian cancer cells to platinum and
PARPis. These results provide a preclinical rationale
for using a combination of 17-AAG and olaparib and/
or carboplatin in EOCs that are HR proficient either at
baseline or at the time of development of platinum or
PARPi resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Connectivity Map Analysis
We used our previously developed, publicly
available, gene expression signature of BRCAness[16]
which assigned tumors as having a BRCAness phenotype
(BRCAlike-BL) versus not (non-BRCAlike-NBL). In
order to identify matching gene expression signatures
of small molecule drugs, we queried the Connectivity
Map using the top performing genes of the BRCAness
signature, i.e. those that were most upregulated and
downregulated in BL versus NBL tumors using various
cutoffs for differential expression of these genes (i.e. 2
fold, 1.66 fold and 1.5 fold). Small molecule drugs that
were consistently identified via the Connectivity Map
across all cut-offs were then selected for experimental
validation as candidate suppressors of the HR pathway.
Details of the Connectivity Map dataset and analytics are
provided elsewhere [12, 13].

Microarray data analysis
We accessed Agilent-014850 Whole Human
Genome Microarray expression data of 17-AAG treated
breast cancer cell lines[29] that were publicly available in
GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus, accession #23209). Raw
data were imported and analyzed using BRB-ArrayTools
Version: 4.2.0 - Beta_2 (Biometrics Research Branch,
National Cancer Institute). In order to assess whether the
gene expression profiles of control and 17-AAG treated
breast cancer cell lines were enriched for specific pathways
