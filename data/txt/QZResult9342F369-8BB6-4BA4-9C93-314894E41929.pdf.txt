Abstract
Immunotherapy with rituximab alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy has significantly improved the
treatment outcome of B-cell lymphoma patients. Nevertheless, a subpopulation of patients does not respond
to rituximab. The reason for treatment failure as well as the exact mechanism of action is still uncertain. The
function of rituximab has long been associated with the partitioning of CD20 molecules to membrane microdomains. Here, we show that concomitant antifungal treatment with itraconazole impairs the rituximab antilymphoma effect both in vitro and in vivo. At the molecular level, recruitment of CD20 to lipid rafts is inhibited
in the presence of itraconazole. Furthermore, calcium influx, which is crucial for rituximab-mediated cell
death, was nearly completely abolished by itraconazole treatment. In contrast, the antifungal drug caspofungin
did not inhibit CD20 recruitment to lipid rafts, nor did it affect calcium influx or the cytotoxic effect of
rituximab. The finding that itraconazole also abolished the cytotoxic effects of other therapeutic antibodies
directed against lipid raft–associated molecules (i.e., CD20 and CD52) but not those against the non–raftassociated molecule CD33 further supported our proposed mechanism of action. Our results argue that
concomitant medications must be adjusted carefully to achieve optimal antitumor effects with monoclonal
antibodies. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4292–6. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab directed
against the cell surface molecule CD20 of mature B cells
has been proved to be successful in the treatment of a variety
of B-cell malignancies (1, 2). Rituximab has been shown to
induce cell killing via antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (3), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC;
ref. 4), and the induction of apoptosis (5). On the molecular
level, membrane microdomains have been shown to be
associated with the function of rituximab. Binding of rituximab causes a rapid redistribution of CD20 molecules to
detergent-resistant membranes termed lipid rafts (6).
These specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane
are highly enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (7).
It is well documented that patients with hematologic malignancies have a high risk of developing invasive fungal infections. The higher risk is attributed to host defense
impairment due to intensive cytotoxic and immunosuppresAuthors' Affiliations: 1Third Medical Department and 2Department of

sive therapies. Candida spp. have been the main cause of invasive fungal infections. As early treatment initiation in patients
with invasive fungal infections has a profound effect on mortality rates, different antifungal treatment strategies like prophylaxis and empirical and preemptive treatment have been
developed. Azoles are the most broadly used antifungal drugs
inhibiting the sterol 14α-demethylase activity and blocking
sterol biosynthesis, which is lethal in unicellular organisms
(8). In animals, it has been shown that azoles lower endogenous cholesterol synthesis (9). As lipid rafts consist of sphingolipids and cholesterol and lipid rafts have been shown to be
crucial for rituximab-induced cell death, we asked whether rituximab exhibits its full anti-lymphoma effect in the presence
of azoles. Indeed, here we show that rituximab-mediated cell
death is impaired in the presence of itraconazole both in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, antifungal treatment with itraconazole only affects targeted treatment against raft-associated molecules (CD20 and CD52) but not against the non–raft-associated
molecule CD33. This suggests the importance of the molecular
event of raft recruitment for the full anti-lymphoma effect of the
mAbs rituximab and alemtuzumab.

from Janssen-Cilag, anti-CD20 from Novocastra (UK), and anti-CD52 and anti-CD33 mAbs from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Inhibition of functional rafts using
methyl-β-cyclodextrine or itraconazole
Cells were incubated for 30 minutes with 10 mmol/L
methyl-β-cyclodextrine (MβCD; Sigma) and for 1 hour with
itraconazole or caspofungin. After addition of rituximab, cells
were incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C and lysed, and then
raft fractions were prepared (10).
Rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity assay
For rituximab-mediated cell death (apoptosis and CDC), 1 × 106
cells were resuspended in culture medium with 10% human
serum (non–heat inactivated) with or without 100 μg/mL rituximab at 37°C for 24 hours. Dead and viable cells were discriminated by Annexin/propidium iodide (PI) staining (11).
Purification of raft fractions and Western blotting
Purification of raft fractions has been described (10).
Ca2+ influx
SUDHL4 cells were loaded with Fluo-3AM (4 μmol/L) and
seeded in a poly-D-lysine–coated microtiter plate. After 1hour incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed twice in assay
buffer and analyzed. Rituximab was then added and, immediately, quantitative changes in the intracellular Ca2+ were
monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (12).
Xenotransplants
Six- to eight-week-old female immunodeficient mice (CD17 scid) were obtained from Charles River. Lymphoma cells
(10 × 107) suspended in sterile PBS (100 μL) were injected s.c.
into the right shoulder region. Mice with similar tumor sizes
(∼100 mm2) were selected and randomized to treatment
groups (five mice per group). Mice were treated with 250
μg rituximab weekly i.v. or left untreated. A loading dose of
itraconazole (100 μg) was administered i.v. before rituximab
was injected. Then, itraconazole was given p.o. (20 mg/kg;
ref. 13). Animals were monitored for general appearance
and tumor volume. Mice were killed if tumors caused discomfort. All animal experiments were authorized by a regional government agency (Regierung von Oberbayern, license
no. 55.2-1-54-2531-52-07).

Results
Antifungal therapy with itraconazole, but not
caspofungin, impairs rituximab-mediated cell death
through inhibition of CD20 raft recruitment
The mAb rituximab has been shown to effectively eradicate CD20-positive lymphoma cells both in vitro and in vivo.
To test whether rituximab-mediated cell death was affected
by itraconazole, we incubated the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line SUDHL4 with rituximab in the presence or absence of itraconazole. Treatment with rituximab induced
cell death in about 60% of the lymphoma cells. This effect

www.aacrjournals.org

was mainly due to CDC. In the presence of heat-inactivated
serum, the anti-lymphoma effect of rituximab was only 20%
to 30% (data not shown). The rituximab anti-lymphoma effect
was almost completely abolished in the presence of itraconazole, but not by the antifungal drug caspofungin (Fig. 1A). The
attenuated effect of rituximab in the presence of itraconazole
was highly statistically significant (Fig. 1B). As rituximab
binding results in CD20 raft recruitment necessary for its cytotoxic effect, we next asked whether the impaired response
to rituximab in the presence of itraconazole was due to differences in CD20 raft recruitment. To this aim, lipid rafts were
isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown previously, rituximab treatment resulted in immediate CD20 raft
recruitment (4, 11). MβCD, which inhibits the formation of
functional lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion, was used as
a control. CD20 raft recruitment was observed neither in
the presence of MβCD nor in the presence of itraconazole
(Fig. 1C). We confirmed these data using another lymphoma
cell line, Nceb (data not shown).
Translocation of CD20 into lipid rafts has been shown to
be crucial for calcium influx and apoptosis (12). Therefore,
we next tested the rituximab-induced calcium flux in the
absence and presence of itraconazole. Indeed, calcium flux
was almost completely abolished in the presence of itraconazole but not caspofungin (Fig. 1D), indicating that concomitant medication with itraconazole critically interferes with
the rituximab-mediated anti-lymphoma effect.
Itraconazole impairs rituximab-induced lymphoma
control in vivo
To test whether a sufficient concentration of itraconazole
that is able to impair rituximab-mediated cell death would be
achieved in vivo, we used a xenograft mouse model. Lymphoma cells were inoculated s.c. After measurable tumors were
visible, mice were left untreated or treated with rituximab or
with a combination of rituximab and itraconazole. In mice
treated with rituximab, no lymphoma growth for more than
2 weeks was observed. In contrast, untreated mice developed
a rapid progression of the lymphoma with a 3-fold increase in
size within 18 days. Most importantly, in mice that were treated with rituximab in the presence of itraconazole, rituximab
failed to prevent tumor growth, indicating that the concentration was sufficient to antagonize the rituximab anti-lymphoma effect (Fig. 2). The differences in tumor growth were
statistically significant (Fig. 2), showing that concomitant
medication with itraconazole has to be reconsidered in conjunction with rituximab treatment. Of note, CDC induced by
rituximab in vitro in the presence of mouse serum was significantly lower (<50%) compared with human serum (data not
shown). Therefore, the in vivo effect in the xenograft mouse
model may underestimate the effect of rituximab in humans.
Only antibody treatment against raft-associated
molecules is impaired by itraconazole
The importance of lipid raft recruitment has been shown for
several receptors including the antigen B- and T-cell receptors
(14, 15). In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, alemtuzumab, a mAb directed against CD52, induces cell death

Itraconazole Impairs Antibody Treatment

in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, not only rituximab but also
alemtuzumab was affected by itraconazole. Finally, we
present the underlying mechanism of how azoles interfere
with anticancer drugs (i.e., mAbs). Of note, only mAbs that
lead to lipid raft recruitment are affected by itraconazole.
Therefore, these data have significant clinical implications
for the treatment of patients with mAbs and might help in
the use of these drugs without losing their efficacy by concomitant medication. Importantly, the antifungal drug caspofungin did not affect lipid raft recruitment, Ca2+ influx,
or the rituximab anti-lymphoma effect. This finding is remarkable because another antifungal drug, nystatin, a polyene, is well known to inhibit functional lipid rafts (17).
Therefore, in contrast to polyene and azole antifungal drugs,

were injected s.c. into the right shoulder region of immunodeficient mice

and randomized to treatment groups (five mice per group). Mice were
treated with 250 μg rituximab weekly i.v. or left untreated. A loading

through a lipid raft–dependent mechanism (16). To test
whether the effect of itraconazole was a general phenomenon
or only affecting rituximab-mediated cell death, we treated
Jurkat lymphoma cells with alemtuzumab in the presence or
absence of itraconazole. Indeed, itraconazole impaired
alemtuzumab-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, treatment with alemtuzumab resulted in a rapid recruitment of CD52 to lipid microdomains
(Fig. 3B), indicating the importance of the molecular event.
In contrast, gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a humanized antiCD33 mAb that is used in the therapy of patients with acute
myeloid leukemia. Fungal infections are a major problem in
these patients. Therefore, a possible interaction of gemtuzumab and itraconazole would be of great clinical relevance. Interestingly, in contrast to rituximab and alemtuzumab, the
anti-leukemic function of gemtuzumab was not affected by
itraconazole (Fig. 3A). Importantly, no CD33 recruitment to
lipid rafts was observed after anti-CD33 mAb treatment (Fig. 3B).
This further supports our proposed mechanism of action that
itraconazole inhibits the segregation of raft-associated molecules to lipid microdomains after treatment with mAbs. However, as this anti-CD33 antibody is linked to a derivative of
calicheamicin, a potent cytotoxic antibiotic, we cannot rule
out that the cytotoxic effects of therapeutic antibodies directed against lipid raft–associated molecules would be less impaired by itraconazole if these antibodies were linked to toxins.

Discussion
In the present study, we show that rituximab-mediated
cell death is impaired in the presence of itraconazole both

the echinocandine caspofungin is the only antifungal drug
that does not affect rituximab-induced cell death. Based
on our in vitro studies, the use of caspofungin offers an easy
solution to circumvent the problem of drug interference
with rituximab in case a simultaneous antifungal therapy
is necessary.
Of course, not every patient receiving rituximab also needs
antifungal therapy. However, besides the standard R-CHOP
immunochemotherapies, rituximab is also given together
with chemotherapy as conditioning therapy for patients with
recurrent lymphoma who receive autologous hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation and for patients with CD20-positive
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For these patients, antifungal
prophylaxis with azoles is recommended (18). Therefore, the
scenario of a concomitant therapy of azoles and rituximab is
not frequent but common.
Recently, the fact that concomitant medication may influence rituximab treatment has been shown. Statins impaired
rituximab-induced anti-lymphoma effect by inducing a conformational change of CD20 (19). This led to an impaired
binding of anti-CD20 mAb. However, no functional data were
presented that the anti-lymphoma effect was impaired.
Therefore, it is unclear from this study whether statins exhibit an anti-rituximab effect in vivo or whether further mAbs
are affected by statins. In a recent prospective cohort
analysis, no interference of statins with rituximab in vivo
was observed (20). Therefore, the effect of this study is still
unclear. We now show that itraconazole severely impairs the
function of the mAb rituximab both in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, alemtuzumab was also affected in the presence
of the antifungal drug. Therefore, it seems that our finding

that azoles inhibit the effect of mAbs that are directed
against raft-associated molecules is a general phenomenon
rather than an antibody-specific effect.
During the past few years, progress has been made in the
treatment of several malignant diseases. This progress is
mainly due to the development of targeted therapies with
mAbs and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The number of mAbs
as well as kinase inhibitors is steadily increasing. Defining
the mechanism of how mAbs are affected by concomitant
medication is so important especially because not all mAbs
are affected by azoles. Therefore, these data have significant
clinical implications for the treatment with mAbs and might
help in the use of these drugs without losing their efficacy by
concomitant medication.
