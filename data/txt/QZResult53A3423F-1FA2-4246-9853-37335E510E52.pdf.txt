Abstract
The constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is frequently
detected in most types of human cancer where it plays important roles in survival, drug resistance, angiogenesis, and other functions. Targeting constitutive STAT3 signaling is thus an attractive therapeutic approach
for these cancers. We have recently developed novel small-molecule STAT3 inhibitors, known as FLLL31 and
FLLL32, which are derived from curcumin (the primary bioactive compound of turmeric). These compounds
are designed to bind selectively to Janus kinase 2 and the STAT3 Src homology-2 domain, which serve crucial
roles in STAT3 dimerization and signal transduction. Here we show that FLLL31 and FLLL32 are effective
inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation, DNA-binding activity, and transactivation in vitro, leading to the impediment of multiple oncogenic processes and the induction of apoptosis in pancreatic and breast cancer cell
lines. FLLL31 and FLLL32 also inhibit colony formation in soft agar and cell invasion and exhibit synergy with
the anticancer drug doxorubicin against breast cancer cells. In addition, we show that FLLL32 can inhibit the
induction of STAT3 phosphorylation by IFNα and interleukin-6 in breast cancer cells. We also show that
administration of FLLL32 can inhibit tumor growth and vascularity in chicken embryo xenografts as well
as substantially reduce tumor volumes in mouse xenografts. Our findings highlight the potential of these
new compounds and their efficacy in targeting pancreatic and breast cancers that exhibit constitutive STAT3
signaling. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2445–54. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The American Cancer Society estimated that more than
200,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer and more than
40,000 deaths are expected among women in the United
States per year. In women, breast cancer remains the second
most fatal form of cancer after lung cancer. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most serious of cancers. According to the
American Cancer Society, there are an estimated 42,470
new cases and 35,240 deaths from pancreatic cancer in the
United States in 2009. The prognosis is generally regarded as

poor and the overall survival rate of all stages is less than 1%
at 5 years, with most patients dying within 1 year. There is a
critical need to develop more effective treatments for pancreatic and breast cancers.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
is a member of a family of latent cytosolic transcription factors whose activation is contingent on the phosphorylation
of a conserved tyrosine residue (Y705) by upstream kinases
such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2; ref. 1). This event promotes the
dimerization of STAT3 monomers via their Src homology-2
(SH2) domains, rendering them in a transcriptionally active
conformation (2). Persistent activation of the JAK2/STAT3
signaling pathway has been documented in a wide range of
human solid and blood cancers and is commonly associated
with a worse prognosis (3, 4). Among the cancer-promoting
activities ascribed to persistent STAT3 signaling are those involved with cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, host
immune evasion, and resistance to apoptosis (5, 6). Interference with the STAT3 signaling pathway in cancer cells, such
as by antisense oligonucleotides and dominant-negative
STAT3 mutants, has been shown to result in growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis (7–10). Although STAT3
serves critical and necessary roles in early embryogenesis, its
presence in the majority of normal adult cell types is largely
dispensable, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy

(11–13). Numerous strategies have since been used to inhibit
constitutive STAT3 signaling in cancerous cells. The selective
inhibition of JAK2 can prevent STAT3 phosphorylation and
dimerization, and several JAK2 inhibitors including AG490,
WP1066, and SD-1029 have been reported in recent literature
(14–16). The necessity of an intact SH2 domain also makes
it a rational target for the disruption of STAT3 signaling
(17). Peptide-based SH2 inhibitors have previously been described, but they are hindered by limited cell permeability,
poor in vivo stability, and the potential for immunogenicity
(18, 19). The development of nonpeptide small-molecule SH2
inhibitors, such as Stattic, STA-21, and S3I-201, has also been
recently reported (17, 20, 21).
In conjunction with our collaborators, we have developed
and evaluated a series of novel nonpeptide JAK2/SH2 inhibitors based on the structure of the plant phytochemical
known as curcumin. Curcumin is the bioactive component
of Curcuma longa and the subject of extensive research due
to its broad spectrum of biologically beneficial activities and
its relative safety in large dosages (22, 23). The complex
chemistry of curcumin allows it to inhibit multiple oncogenic
processes, including those associated with the JAK2/STAT3
pathway (24). Poor bioavailability limits the use of curcumin
as a cancer therapeutic agent, but it is potentially useful as
a lead compound for the development of new JAK2/STAT3
inhibitors (25). In our initial testing, two of our compounds
in particular, designated FLLL31 and FLLL32, were found to
be especially potent at inhibiting the viability of breast and
pancreatic cancer cells that feature constitutively activated
STAT3, thus warranting a closer look at their antitumor
properties. Here we report our findings on the growthsuppressive activities of FLLL31 and FLLL32, their efficacy
in inhibiting constitutive STAT3 signaling in vitro, and the
effects of FLLL32 on the processes of tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, BXPC-3,
HPAC, and SW1990), breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-453), WI-38 normal
human lung fibroblasts, and human embryonic kidney
(HEK)-293 cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. These cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SUM159 breast cancer cells were obtained from Dr. Max S. Wicha (University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and normal human bladder smooth muscle
cells (BdsMC) were purchased from Lonza Walkersville, Inc.
SUM159 and HMEC were cultured in Ham's F12 containing
5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 μg/mL insulin, 1 μg/mL
hydrocortisone, and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor.
The BdsMC were cultured in medium recommended by the
protocol from Lonza Walkersville. Human pancreatic duct
epithelial cells (HPDE) were provided by Dr. Ming-Sound
Tsao (Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and maintained in CnT-07CF epidermal
keratinocyte medium supplemented with 0.07 mmol/L CaCl2.

JAK2 and STAT3 SH2 inhibitors. FLLL31, FLLL32,
and WP1066 (16), a JAK2 inhibitor, were synthesized in
Dr. Pui-Kai Li's laboratory. JAK2 inhibitors AG490 (15) and
SD-1029 (14) and STAT3 SH2 inhibitors S3I-201 (21) and Stattic (20) were purchased from Calbiochem. Curcumin was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Western blot analysis. Cancer cells were treated with
these agents or DMSO for 24 h. For IFNα and interleukin-6
(IL-6) treatments, MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells were serum starved for 24 h. The cells were pretreated with FLLL32
(10 μmol/L) for 2 h and 50 ng/mL of IFNα or IL-6 were then
added for 30 min before the cells were collected. Membranes
were probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of antibodies (Cell Signaling Tech.) against phospho-specific STAT3 (hereafter
referred to as P-STAT3; tyrosine 705), extracellular signal–
regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2; threonine 202/tyrosine 204),
AKT (serine 473), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR;
tyrosine 1068), p70S6K (threonine 389), protein kinase C-δ
(PKC-δ; threonine 505), Src (tyrosine 416), mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR; serine 2448), cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), cleaved caspase-3, cyclin D, Bcl-2, survivin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). Membranes were analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescence Plus reagents and scanned with the Storm
Scanner (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). Integrated
densities of the P-STAT3 (Y705), STAT3, cleaved caspase-3,
and GAPDH bands in Western blots were quantified using
ImageJ software. The integrated densities of the P-STAT3,
STAT3, and cleaved caspase-3 bands were individually normalized to the GAPDH band for each cancer cell line using
ImageJ software. The relatively reduced or increased levels of
P-STAT3, STAT3, and cleaved caspase-3 were compared with
the DMSO control, which was set as 1.00.
JAK2 and other human kinase activity assays. JAK2
kinase activity was assessed with the HTScan JAK2 Kinase
Assay Kit per manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling Technologies). The possible effects of FLLL32 on the other 10
purified human protein kinases were determined by using
a Kinase Profiler Assay (Reaction Biology Corp.).
STAT3 DNA-binding and STAT3-dependent transcriptional luciferase activity assays. Following treatment with
FLLL31, FLLL32, curcumin, or DMSO for 24 h, nuclear extracts
of cells were analyzed for STAT3 and STAT1 DNA binding activities in triplicates using TransFactor Universal STAT3- and
STAT1-specific kits following the manufacturer's protocol
(Clontech, Inc.). To assess transcriptional activity, MDA-MB231 cells were stably transfected with the pLucTKS3 luciferase
reporter, which contains seven copies of the STAT3 binding
site in a thymidine kinase minimal promoter (26). The cells
were harvested in reporter lysis buffer after 24 h of treatment.
Luciferase activity is expressed as counts per second per microgram of protein. Luciferase activity is presented relative to
a pLucTKS3-transfected sample treated with DMSO, arbitrarily set at 100%. The results of the luciferase assay represent the
averages from three independent experiments.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RNA was collected
from MDA-MB-231 and PANC-1 cells with RNeasy kits
(Qiagen) after 24 h of treatment with FLLL31, FLLL32, and

curcumin. cDNA was generated from 500-ng samples of RNA
using Omniscript RT (Qiagen). Primer sequences and source
information can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
MTT cell viability assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates
(3,000 per well) in triplicate and then treated with 0.5 to
5 μmol/L of FLLL31 or FLLL32 or with 0.5 to 30 μmol/L of curcumin (Sigma) for 72 h. MTT (Sigma; 25 μL) was added to each
sample and incubated for 3.5 h. Then, 100 μL of N,N-dimethylformamide solubilization solution were added to each well.
The absorbance at 450 nm was read the following day. Halfmaximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined
using Sigma Plot 9.0 software (Systat Software, Inc.).
Soft-agar colony formation assay. A 0.6% agar gel with
10% FBS in DMEM was prepared and added to a six-well culture dish as a base agar. MDA-MB-231 cells (5,000 per well)
were plated in 0.4% agar gel with 10% FBS in DMEM supplemented with curcumin, FLLL31, or FLLL32 on top of the base
agar and allowed to grow for 2 wk. Colonies were stained
with MTT dye. Numbers were normalized as a percentage
of colonies formed in DMSO treatment. The results represent
the averages from three independent experiments.
Cell invasion assay. Cell invasiveness was evaluated with
the InnoCyte Laminin-Based 96-Well Cell Invasion Assay
per manufacturer's instructions (EMD Biosciences). In brief,
5 × 104 MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in a laminin-coated
cell culture insert in serum-free DMEM and treated with
1 μmol/L of DMSO, FLLL31, FLLL32, or curcumin. Cells were
allowed to migrate/invade the laminin layer in the presence
of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant

for 24 h. Invading cells were stained with Calcein-AM and
detected with a fluorimeter. The data were normalized as
relative fluorescent units (RFU) per 104 cells. Results are from
three independent experiments and compared as a percentage of the RFU of the DMSO-treated controls.
Transfection with constitutive active STAT3. HEK293
cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with a vector
that encodes constitutive STAT3 (STAT3-C), which is tagged
with a FLAG epitope (27). The second day, cells were treated
with FLLL32 or DMSO. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
harvested for Western blot analysis.
Mouse xenografts. All animal studies were conducted in
accordance with the standard procedures approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital. MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells (1 × 10 7 in Matrigel) were
implanted s.c. into the flank region of 4- to 5-wk-old female
athymic nude mice. After tumors developed (12 d), the mice
were randomized into two groups and treated with 50 mg/kg
FLLL32 or DMSO (five mice per group) i.p. daily for 19 d.
Tumor growth was determined by measuring the major (L)
and minor (W) diameter with a caliper. The tumor volume
was calculated according to the following formula: tumor
volume = 0.5236 × L × W2.
Chorioallantoic membrane xenograft assay. The procedure used was a modification of a previously published
procedure (28). Fertile leghorn chicken eggs (CBT Farms)
were incubated until 10 DI. The sample size was 8 to 14
embryos from two separate experiments. PANC-1 cells

Figure 2. FLLL31 and FLLL32 are potent inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (A) and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer
cells (B) were treated with 2.5 and 5 μmol/L of FLLL31 and FLLL32 for 24 h. The integrated densities of P-STAT3, STAT3, and cleaved caspase-3

caspase-3 were normalized to the DMSO control, which was set as 1.00. C, HMEC and HPDE normal human mammary and pancreatic cells tolerate
relatively high dosages of FLLL31 and FLLL32 with no evidence of caspase-3 cleavage. D, FLLL32 inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation in IFNα-stimulated
MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. The phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 is unimpaired. Western blot analysis was analyzed as described in
Materials and Methods.

(250,000 in inert extracellular matrix) were implanted just
under the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Four and
48 h after tumor implantation, a maximal tolerated dose
of 5 mg/kg gemcitabine (ChemieTek), 25 mg/kg FLLL32, or
solvent (DMSO in sterile water for injection) was placed onto
the chorion. Four days after tumor implantation, CAMs were
fixed as described (28). Images were captured at ×6.25
magnification using a bright-field dissecting microscope
(Wild M400 Photomakroscop) connected to a cooled camera
(QImaging). The number of vessels surrounding the tumor
was manually counted, and the size of the tumor determined
using NIH ImageJ densitometry software.
Determination of combinatorial effects. The ability
of doxorubicin, FLLL31, and FLLL32 to act in a synergistic
manner with regard to growth inhibition was determined
as described by Chou and colleagues (29). Calcusyn software
(Biosoft) was used to determine the combinational index (CI)
for each concentration of drug mixture used. A CI value of
<1 represents a case where synergism of doxorubicin, FLLL31,
and FLLL32 was present. CI values of 1 and >1 represent
additive and antagonistic effects, respectively.

Results
The JAK2/SH2 inhibitors FLLL31 and FLLL32. FLLL31
and FLLL32 are diketone analogues of curcumin (Fig. 1A).
The central β-dicarbonyl moiety of curcumin is subject to
keto-enol tautomerization, which is hypothesized to influence its target selectivity and by virtue of its biological activity.6 By replacing the two hydrogen atoms on the central
carbon of curcumin with geminal dimethyl substituents
(FLLL31) or a spiro-cyclohexyl ring (FLLL32), the ability
of curcumin to enolize is eliminated. These modifications
are also predicted to better interact with key binding sites
of JAK2 and the SH2 dimerization domain of STAT3 than
the keto-enol form of curcumin (Fig. 1B). In addition, FLLL31
and FLLL32 feature 3,4-dimethoxy substituents to mimic
those of dimethoxycurcumin, a curcumin analogue that
has been shown to have increased stability, higher plasma

concentration, and greater efficacy against cancer cells than
standard curcumin (30, 31).
FLLL31 and FLLL32 inhibit JAK2 kinase activity. JAK2
serves as a docking site for the SH2 domain of STAT3 monomers. The subsequent JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of
STAT3 activates the transcription factor, promoting its
dimerization (32, 33). We evaluated the ability of FLLL31
and FLLL32 to inhibit JAK2 kinase activity. In our comparisons, 5 μmol/L of FLLL31 and FLLL32 significantly inhibited
JAK2 kinase activity (P < 0.05) over a DMSO control, resulting
in approximately 60% and 75% reductions in activity, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, our compounds
were more effective than previously characterized JAK2 inhibitors, such as AG490 and WP1066, and curcumin itself.
FLLL31 and FLLL32 downregulate STAT3 phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity. To examine the efficacy of
FLLL31 and FLLL32 in inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation, a
panel of breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines known to express high endogenous levels of constitutively activated
STAT3 were used. FLLL31 and FLLL32 effectively reduced
levels of P-STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 breast and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 2). We observed similar results
in SK-Br-3, MDA-MB-468, and SUM159 breast cancer cells
and in HPAC, BXPC-3, and SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells
(Supplementary Figs. S2A–C and S3A–C, respectively). The
expression of STAT3 target genes, such as cyclin D1, survivin,
and Bcl-2 (3, 34, 35), was likewise downregulated, and neither
compound had appreciable inhibitory effects on the expression or phosphorylation status of other kinases and transcription factors such as ERK1/2, mTOR, PKC-δ, p70S6K,
AKT, and Src (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Increased levels
of P-ERK1/2 were observed in a few cancer cell lines on
FLLL31 and FLLL32 treatment. Decreases in P-STAT3 were
concomitant with increased cleavage of procaspase-3 and
PARP, one of the immediate substrates of this effector caspase.

We further examined whether FLLL32 inhibits the activity
of other human kinases using a kinase profile assay. FLLL32
exhibits little inhibition (IC50 >100 μmol/L) on tyrosine kinases, containing SH2 or both SH2 and SH3 domains and
other protein kinases such as AKT2, cyclin-dependent kinase-2/cyclin D1, EGFR, ErbB2/HER2, and Met (Supplementary Table S2). These results support the specificity of
FLLL32 to inhibit STAT3.
To support that induction of apoptosis is through inhibition of endogenous STAT3, we transiently expressed a known
constitutively active STAT3, STAT3-C (27), in cancer cells.
We rationalize that if FLLL32 induces apoptosis through
inhibition of endogenous STAT3, the restoration of STAT3
activity by transfected STAT3-C should rescue FLLL32mediated apoptosis. We chose to focus on FLLL32 in this
experiment instead of FLLL31 because, based on the computer modeling and free binding energy, FLLL32 is more
selective for STAT3 (Fig. 1) and is our leading compound
to target STAT3. Our results show that the expression of
STAT3-C can rescue the induction of apoptosis evidenced
by cleaved caspase-3 in HEK293 cancer cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4). These results provide additional support that induction of apoptosis by FLLL32 is through the endogenous
STAT3 protein in cancer cells.
Furthermore, the induction of apoptosis was limited to the
cancer cells because concentrations of FLLL31 and FLLL32
as high as 10 μmol/L were unable to induce caspase-3 cleavage in HMEC or HPDE cells, which represent normal breast
and pancreatic cells, respectively (Fig. 2C). Additional normal
cell lines, such as WI-38 lung and BdsMC bladder cells,
likewise showed no evidence of apoptosis following FLLL31
and FLLL32 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). We also
found that the STAT3 phosphorylation levels were low, and
FLLL32 treatment slightly induced STAT3 phosphorylation
levels in WI-38 and BdsMC cells (Supplementary Fig. S5)

Figure 3. A, FLLL31 and FLLL32 reduce the ability of STAT3 to bind DNA in nuclear extracts isolated from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and PANC-1
pancreatic cancer cells. B, FLLL31- and FLLL32-mediated decreases in STAT3 DNA-binding activity correlate with increases in STAT1 DNA-binding
activity in MDA-MB-231 cells.

but reduced STAT3 phosphorylation levels in HMEC cells
(data not shown). The selectivity of our compounds for
STAT3 inhibition was evident when compared with closely
related proteins, such as STAT1 and STAT2. The addition
of IFNα resulted in robust phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2,
and STAT3 (Fig. 2D). Pretreatment of these cells with FLLL32
effectively inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 specifically
but had no effect on the extent of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation. FLLL32 was similarly able to block induction of
P-STAT3 in MDA-MB-453 by IL-6 (Supplementary Fig. S6).
We then examined the ability of STAT3 to bind DNA in
breast and pancreatic cancer cells following treatment with
FLLL31 and FLLL32. Levels of STAT3 DNA-binding activity
dropped sharply in MDA-MB-231 and PANC-1 cells following
FLLL31 and FLLL32 treatment, decreases that were significantly lower than those elicited by equimolar concentrations of curcumin (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in MDA-MB-468
and HPAC (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). It is again important to note that these effects were specific to STAT3 DNAbinding activity. STAT1 DNA-binding activity was not only unimpaired but actually slightly enhanced by FLLL31 and FLLL32
(Fig. 3B), which may have important consequences given the
proapoptotic and antiproliferative activities of STAT1 (36, 37).

FLLL31 and FLLL32 are potent inhibitors of STAT3mediated gene transcription. We next assessed the effects
of FLLL31 and FLLL32 on STAT3 transcriptional activity with
luciferase assays. Due to its high endogenous levels of
P-STAT3, the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was chosen for stable transfection with pLucTKS3 (Fig. 4A). We
found that both FLLL31 and FLLL32 reduced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent fashion following 24 hours of treatment (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the extents of these reductions
were significantly greater than those induced by comparable
dosages of curcumin (P < 0.05).
To further confirm these observations, we then looked at
the expression of several STAT3 target genes, such as cyclin
D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, survivin, and VEGF (34, 35). In MDA-MB-231
(Fig. 4C) and PANC-1 (Fig. 4D) cancer cells, FLLL31 and FLLL32
visibly reduced the expression of the STAT3 target genes over a
DMSO control and equimolar concentrations of curcumin.
FLLL31 and FLLL32 inhibit cell viability and cell invasion
and generate synergy with doxorubicin. After establishing
the efficacy of FLLL31 and FLLL32 as selective JAK2/STAT3
inhibitors, we compared their growth-suppressive activities
to those produced by previously reported inhibitors, including the aforementioned JAK2 inhibitors WP1066, SD-1029,

Figure 4. FLLL31 and FLLL32 inhibit STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation. A, pLucTKS3 luciferase reporter construct. B, STAT3-mediated
expression of luciferase activity is inhibited by FLLL31 and FLLL32 to a greater extent than that with curcumin. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (C)
and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells (D) show decreased expression of STAT3 downstream target genes following treatment with FLLL31 and FLLL32.
RNA was collected and reverse transcription-PCR reactions were done.

and AG490 and the STAT3 SH2 inhibitors Stattic and S3I201. The IC50 values calculated for each compound and cell
line are summarized in Supplementary Table S3. In our
comparisons, FLLL31 and FLLL32 showed better growthsuppressive activity relative to the other compounds, performing similarly with respect to one another in each of
the cell lines tested.
We next looked at the effect that FLLL31 and FLLL32 had
on the anchorage-independent growth and invasive capacity of the MDA-MB-231 cell line. We assessed anchorageindependent growth with soft-agar colony formation assays
(38). As expected, FLLL31 and FLLL32 were both found to
inhibit the formation of MDA-MB-231 colonies, each reducing
overall colony numbers by approximately 40% over that of
curcumin (Fig. 5A).
We also determined what effects FLLL31 and FLLL32 had
on the invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231, which has been reported to have a highly metastatic phenotype (39). Consistent
with our prior observations, FLLL31 and FLLL32 substantially
reduced the invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 over curcumin,
which had comparatively minimal effect (Fig. 5B).
We also examined whether FLLL31 or FLLL32 could act in
an additive or synergistic manner with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin. We found that 100 to
400 nmol/L dosages of doxorubicin acted in a synergistic
fashion with a 5,000 nmol/L dose of FLLL31 or FLLL32
(Fig. 5C and D, respectively) in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, resulting in a significant decrease in cell viability
over either agent acting alone (P < 0.05).

FLLL32 suppresses tumor growth and vascularization in vivo. Mouse xenograft experiments were then done
to gauge the antitumor effects of our compounds in an
in vivo system. We shifted our focus to FLLL32 for these
experiments due to its higher predictive binding energy
to JAK2 and STAT3 SH2 than FLLL31 (data not shown).
The administration of FLLL32 resulted in significantly
reduced tumor burdens in the MDA-MB-231 xenografted
mice relative to their DMSO-treated counterparts (Fig. 6A).
Western blots done with tumor tissue samples harvested
from these mice also showed decreases in total levels of
STAT3 phosphorylation.
We next examined whether FLLL32 would affect tumor
growth and vascularity in a chicken embryo CAM human
tumor xenograft model (ref. 28; Fig. 6B–D). It was found
that gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapeutic agent for
treatment of pancreatic cancer, reduced both tumor volume
(Fig. 6C) and tumor vascularity (Fig. 6D) as compared with
untreated embryos, but these decreases were statistically
insignificant. FLLL32 administration resulted in a significant
reduction in both tumor volume (Fig. 6C) and tumor vascularity (Fig. 6D) in the CAM xenograft assay.

Discussion
In the United States alone, breast and pancreatic cancers
are estimated to have caused approximately 40,170
and 35,240 deaths, respectively, for the year ending in
2009 (40). The present work was prompted by the following

observations: a large percentage of pancreatic and breast
cancers feature aberrantly activated STAT3 (3); approaches
that selectively target constitutive STAT3 signaling have been
shown to be effective at inhibiting cancer-associated processes and cancer cell viability (34, 41); and curcumin, a natural plant polyphenol, displays some capacity for inhibiting
STAT3 without the dose-limiting toxicities inherent to other
cancer therapeutic agents (22, 42, 43). Herein we investigated
the effects of two novel curcumin-based compounds, designated FLLL31 and FLLL32, against breast and pancreatic cancers in both in vitro and in vivo systems.
FLLL31 and FLLL32 differ with respect to other curcumin
analogues in that they were designed to preferentially interact with both the SH2 domain of STAT3 and its upstream

activator, the JAK2 kinase. As our data can attest, this strategy produced potent and selective inhibitors of the STAT3
signaling pathway. The merits of targeting STAT3 as a potential cancer therapy have been thoroughly investigated, and a
growing body of evidence has shown that the inhibition
of constitutively active STAT3 leads to impaired survival
and proliferation (3, 34). The ability of curcumin to inhibit
the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was one of many factors that made
it a desirable choice for a lead compound. In addition to its
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, curcumin also has
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (44). Although
we have yet to evaluate FLLL31 and FLLL32 in these other
regards, their close structural similarity to curcumin suggests
that they may share its pleiotropic nature.

Novel Curcumin Analogues Target JAK2/STAT3

In this report, we have shown that FLLL31 and FLLL32 are
effective JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors, and in our analysis, each
had higher efficacy against pancreatic and breast cancer cell
viability than currently available commercial JAK2 and
STAT3 inhibitors as well as curcumin. Moreover, FLLL31
and FLLL32 are selective for their intended targets, JAK2
and STAT3. FLLL31 and FLLL32 did not inhibit STAT1
DNA-binding activity or the phosphorylation of mTOR,
p70S6K, ERK1/2, AKT, EGFR, and Src. FLLL32 also had little
effect on the kinase activity of five tyrosine kinases containing SH2 and/or SH3 domains and five other protein kinases.
The ability of FLLL31 and FLLL32 to generate synergy with
doxorubicin in breast cancer cells suggests that a combination of FLLL31 or FLLL32 with doxorubicin may be more
effective to treat cancer patients than either drug alone. In
addition, the capacity of FLLL32 to inhibit tumor growth
and vascularity in a chicken embryo CAM model using
PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells suggests that FLLL32 may
have the potential to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in cancer
patients. Furthermore, FLLL32 is capable of suppressing
tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer (Fig. 6A)
and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer (data not shown) xenografts
in mouse tumor models. These results provide supportive
evidence that FLLL32 may be effective in suppressing pancreatic and breast tumor cell growth in cancer patients with
constitutive STAT3 signaling.
Although both FLLL31 and FLLL32 inhibit JAK2 and
STAT3, FLLL31 is better by eliminating the enol form, thus
enhancing effective inhibition concentration, while FLLL32
gains additional binding interactions and is more selective
to STAT3 and JAK2 than FLLL31. FLLL32 has a docking free
energy −8.5 kcal/mol of binding to STAT3 SH2, compared to

FLLL31 with a docking free energy −8.1 kcal/mol. For binding
to JAK2, FLLL32 has a docking free energy −10.3 kcal/mol, compared to FLLL31 with a docking free energy −9.6 kcal/mol.
To our knowledge, FLLL32 is the first small molecular inhibitor
that was designed from curcumin to target both JAK2 and
STAT3 SH2 domain. The basic requirements for potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agents require them to be effective against tumor cells in vitro and in mouse tumor models
in vivo, relatively nontoxic to the normal cells, and have better
bioavailability. Our present investigation of FLLL32 suggests
that this small molecule meets many of these criteria, and
its further evaluation and optimization may yield even more
effective antitumor agents in the future.
