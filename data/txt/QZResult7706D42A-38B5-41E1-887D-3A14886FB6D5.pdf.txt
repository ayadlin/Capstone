ABSTRACT
Prolonged exposure to oxidative stress causes Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and
significantly impairs pulmonary function. Previously we have demonstrated that
mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathological factor in hyperoxic ALI. While it is
known that hyperoxia induces the production of stable, but toxic 4-hydroxynonenal
(4-HNE) molecule, it is unknown how the reactive aldehyde disrupts mitochondrial
function. Our previous in vivo study indicated that exposure to hyperoxia significantly
increases 4-HNE-Protein adducts, as well as levels of MDA in total lung homogenates.
Based on the in vivo studies, we explored the effects of 4-HNE in human small
airway epithelial cells (SAECs). Human SAECs treated with 25 μM of 4-HNE showed a
significant decrease in cellular viability and increased caspase-3 activity. Moreover,
4-HNE treated SAECs showed impaired mitochondrial function and energy production
indicated by reduced ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and aconitase
activity. This was followed by a significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen
consumption and depletion of the reserve capacity. The direct effect of 4-HNE on
the mitochondrial respiratory chain was confirmed using Rotenone. Furthermore,
SAECs treated with 25 μM 4-HNE showed a time-dependent depletion of total
Thioredoxin (Trx) proteins and Trx activity. Taken together, our results indicate that
4-HNE induces cellular and mitochondrial dysfunction in human SAECs, leading to an
impaired endogenous antioxidant response.

INTRODUCTION

[5]. In response to hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress,
physiological 4-HNE levels are measured to be less than
20 ng/mg protein [2]. 4-HNE can additionally induce
protein dysfunction by forming adducts with lysine,
histidine, and cysteine residues, as well as generating
stable Michael addition products and disulfide bonds [5,
6]. These detrimental reactions further lead to 4-HNEinduced cellular apoptosis and death [7, 8].
Previously, we have demonstrated that hyperoxia
induces ROS production in mice and affects lung
mitochondrial morphology [9]. ROS production is
well known to enhance lipid peroxidation reactions,
damaging proteins within the mitochondrial respiratory
chain and reducing oxygen consumption rate [8, 10-12].

Hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI) triggers cellular
damage and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that
interfere with the cell’s intrinsic antioxidant responses
[1-3]. During oxidative stress, the cell will undergo lipid
peroxidation reactions, in which destructive oxidized
by-products are produced, such as 4-hydroxynonenal
(4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) [4]. 4-HNE is
an endogenous α,β-unsaturated hydroxyalkenal that is
produced in a concentration range of 0.1-3 µM under
physiological conditions [5]. However, under oxidative
stressful conditions, the concentration of 4-HNE that
accumulates in membranes ranges from 10 µM to 5 mM

Interestingly, it has been shown that Thioredoxin (Trx)
protein systems mediate protection against oxidative
stress induced by hyperoxic lung injury in mice and
are critical for cellular survival [13, 14]. Trx proteins
endogenously protect and reinstate oxidized cellular
proteins, and can perform enzymatic reduction processes,
acting as a proteasome response that reduces disulfide
protein bonds formed by thiol redox reactions [1417]. Trx system proteins ensure proper protein folding,
mediate transcription factor redox reactions, and maintain
mitochondrial membrane potential, all important defensive
responses to oxidative stress [13, 17]. However, Trx serves
as a prime target for 4-HNE because these proteins contain
thiol-disulfide bonds composed of cysteine residues [10,
13, 16, 18].
Thus far, the effects of 4-HNE have not been
explored in human SAECs. SAECs have an important
role in the lungs as they serve as a barrier to external
pathogens and mediate normal immune function [19].
SAEC cells are also vulnerable to oxidative stress,
serving as a critical cell type that should be protected [20,
21]. Hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress is an important
model that reproduces the pulmonary-specific damaging
effects of ALI, as it disrupts epithelial and endothelial
barriers, and generates the release of toxic molecules
and pro-inflammatory mediators [1]. Prolonged exposure
to oxygen fractions (FO2) of 0.8 or greater are shown to
induce respiratory distress in small animal models as well
as pulmonary edema and proliferative fibrosis in lower
order primate models [1]. The link between mechanically
supplied oxygen and HALI appeared in the 1960s and
progressed when studies demonstrated increases in tissue
inflammation and ROS release, which is associated with
cellular damage and a secondary inflammatory response
to ROS from the activation of macrophages, platelets, and
neutrophils [1]. Thus, hyperoxia provides a basis on which
to investigate the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease and
cellular damage.
We first measured the formation of 4-HNE-Protein
adducts and MDA levels in total lung homogenates
in mice exposed to hyperoxia. This was followed by
an in vitro study using human SAECs to characterize
the effects of 4-HNE and determine its functionality.
We demonstrate an elevation of 4-HNE in SAECs and
predict that mitochondrial function will be reduced.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that Trx proteins will be
modified in the presence of 4-HNE, impairing an ROSmediated protective response present in mitochondria.
Our results indicate that 4-HNE decreases human SAEC
viability with an increase in cleaved caspase-3 activity.
4-HNE augmented the production of mitochondrial
ROS, followed by a reduction in mitochondrial oxygen
consumption. Mitochondrial membrane potential and
enzymatic processes were directly affected by 4-HNE.
4-HNE was also shown to inhibit mitochondrial
antioxidant mechanisms by depleting total Trx and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibiting Trx activity, further contributing to cellular
dysfunction and death. Supplemental oxygen therapy is
commonly administered to patients suffering from hypoxia
and a range of diseases; thus, they are susceptible to lung
oxygen toxicity [22-24]. Therefore, this study aims to
provide insight into promising alternative therapeutic
applications that reduce 4-HNE effects on human SAECs
during hyperoxic lung injury.

RESULTS
Hyperoxia induces the formation of 4-HNEprotein adducts
Oxidative stress causes cellular and molecular
dysfunction [21, 22, 25]. Exposure to hyperoxia stimulates
the production of lipid-peroxidation by-products, such
as 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and MDA [4, 5]. To
investigate whether hyperoxia induces elevated 4-HNE
levels, we first measured the production of 4-HNE-Protein
adducts in mice. Mice (N = 6) were exposed to normoxia
and hyperoxia for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Compared to room
air (normoxia), mice exposed to prolonged hyperoxia
showed a significant increase in the levels of 4-HNEProtein adducts (Figure 1A). Hyperoxia exposure for 24
h did not show a significant difference in 4-HNE-ProteinAdducts relative to the control. However, exposure to
48 h hyperoxia resulted in a 2-fold increase of 4-HNEProtein-adducts, whereas at 72 h post-hyperoxia exposure,
there was a 4 fold increase in 4-HNE-Protein-adducts
(Figure 1A). The dose-dependent response indicates that
prolonged hyperoxia exposure and oxidative stress leads to
post-translational protein modification, impairing normal
cellular processes. Furthermore, we measured MDA
(nmol/g protein) levels in mice total lung homogenates
under the same exposure conditions as 4-HNE (Figure 1B).
The results show that prolonged exposure to hyperoxia
for 72 h significantly increased MDA levels 2.7-fold,
compared to normoxia. Conversely, hyperoxia exposure
for 24 and 48 h did not result in significant MDA levels.
These results suggest the production of toxic peroxidized
lipids in response to hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress.

4-HNE induces cellular dysfunction
4-HNE is highly cytotoxic and serves as an indicator
of oxidative stress [4, 5, 11]. Next, we investigated the
functional relevance of 4-HNE in human SAECs. SAECs
were investigated since epithelial cells are vulnerable
to oxidative damage and permeability of the epithelial
membrane barrier can lead to the entry of external
pathogens and impairment of the release of regulatory
immune factors. Deregulation of SAEC viability was
assessed by MTT Cellular Proliferation Assay. SAECs

were treated with 5, 10, 25 μM of 4-HNE, and compared
to vehicle controls (Figure 2A). There was a dosedependent decrease in SAEC viability when exposed
to 4-HNE which is an indicator of cellular dysfunction.
There was significant 2 fold decrease in cellular viability
in SAECs exposed to 25 μM 4-HNE, when compared to
vehicle-treated controls. We further examined cellular
viability by using a Trypan blue exclusion assay. SAECs
were treated with the same chemical conditions as in the
MTT assay. SAECs treated with 5 μM 4-HNE did not
show a significant difference in cell damage (Figure 2B).
However, there was a significant decrease in cell viability
at 10 and 25 μM 4-HNE. A 3.2-fold decrease in viability
was observed with 25 μM 4-HNE. Caspase-3 plays a
critical role in the execution of apoptosis and thus serves as
a marker for apoptosis activation [26]. Cleaved caspase-3
activity was shown to be increased after 10 µM 4-HNE;
however a significant 2.4-fold increase in caspase-3
activity was found with 25 µM 4-HNE treatment (Figure
2C). Taken together, these results indicate that 4-HNE
causes cellular dysfunction by decreasing metabolic
activity and inducing cell death related mechanisms.

4-HNE and the increase in concentration of 4-HNE lead
to a further reduction in ATP levels. A significant 1.8 and 3
fold decrease in ATP levels was observed in response to 10
and 25 μM 4-HNE, respectively. Our results suggest that
4-HNE mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and impairs
the synthesis of ATP. We further assessed mitochondrial
activity by Aconitase assay (Figure 3B). Aconitase is
an enzyme involved in the mitochondrial TCA cycle, a
sequence of reactions that is essential for biochemical
pathways and ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation
[27, 28]. SAECs were treated with 5, 10, and 25 μM of
4-HNE and compared to vehicle-treated control cells, and
assayed for Aconitase activity. Treatment with 4-HNE
produced a significant reduction in Aconitase activity
in a concentration dependent response (Figure 3B).
Compared to the vehicle-treated control, SAECs treated
with 5 μM 4-HNE showed a 30% decrease in Aconitase
activity, while treatment with 10 μM or 25 μM lead to
a 60% decrease and 80% decrease in Aconitase activity,
respectively. These results further confirm 4-HNE-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction and support our findings of
decreased ATP levels.

4-HNE

ATP is a critical form of cellular energy produced
during mitochondrial respiration [11]. Oxidative stress
increases the concentration of reactive oxygen species
and lipid peroxidation by-products, thereby inhibiting
mitochondrial respiration [6, 11]. We therefore further
investigated SAEC mitochondrial function in the
presence of 4-HNE. ATP levels were measured in SAECs
treated with 5, 10, 25 μM of 4-HNE, and compared to
vehicle-treated control cells (Figure 3A). A concentration
dependent response was observed after treatment with

In the presence of 4-HNE, a cell must respond to
an increased energy demand, due to a stressful cellular
environment [8, 11]. To determine whether 4-HNE
impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate OCR,
we measured basal, non-ATP linked, maximal, and nonmitochondrial OCR (pmol/O2/min) within SAECs (Figure
4A-4D). Each reaction was tested with 25 μM of 4-HNE
and compared to a control, since our previous experiments
(Figure 2A-2B) showed that 25 μM 4-HNE elicited the

greatest response in SAECs. Basal OCR was significantly
decreased in response to 4-HNE, as compared to the
controls (Figure 4A). After the addition of oligomycin,
non-ATP OCR was measured and did not show significant
differences between 4-HNE and the control, indicating
the dependence of 4-HNE on mitochondrial ATP synthase
(Figure 4B). Maximal mitochondrial respiration was
induced by addition of FCCP to determine the reserve
capacity. Compared to the control, 4-HNE significantly
lowered the maximal mitochondrial OCR more than
2-fold, signifying that 4-HNE depletes additional reserved
mitochondrial energy (Figure 4C). Non-mitochondrial
respiration was assessed with antimycin A (AA) treatment.
Control and 4-HNE measurements did not differ with
response to OCR (Figure 4D), suggesting 4-HNE effects
are not significantly associated with non-mitochondrial
OCR. These results indicate that 4-HNE has a direct role
in reducing the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration.

To assess whether 4-HNE affected mitochondrial
membrane protein function, JC-1 mitochondrial staining
was utilized. We then analyzed mitochondrial membrane
potential as an indicator of apoptosis and damage by
live cell imaging analysis (Figure 5A-5D). A reduction
in membrane potential results in diffusion of the dye
from the mitochondria and a red to green fluorescence
change [9]. SAECs were treated with 10, 30, and 100
μM 4-HNE and compared to vehicle (0.1% ethanol)
control cells. Vehicle-treated cells and cells treated with
10 µM 4-HNE show red JC-1 aggregates, represented
by arrows in Figure 5A-5B. Treatment with 30 and
100 μM 4-HNE resulted in formation of green JC-1
monomeric aggregates indicating a progressive reduction
in membrane potential or depolarization, with arrows
in Figure 5B-5D indicating higher green fluorescence.
These results indicate that 4-HNE disrupts mitochondrial
membrane potential, causing mitochondrial dysfunction.

decrease proportional to an increase in 4-HNE treatment
(30-100 µM 4-HNE) relative to 10 µM or vehicle (0.1%

support the reduction in ATP levels and impairment of
mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in 4-HNE-treated
SAECs.

cells produced a negligible amount of ROS, whereas
exposure to 5 μM 4-HNE resulted in a 19% increase in
ROS activity, at 10μM there was a 59% increase in ROS
and at 25μM, it reached a 92% increase in ROS. These
results validate that 4-HNE contributes to the production
of ROS and cellular damage. We further investigated the
origin of 4-HNE generated ROS (Figure 6B). Previously,
we found that SAECs treated with 25 μM showed the
greatest increase in total ROS. We used this concentration
for all subsequent experiments. SAECs were also treated
with a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial electron
transport chain complex 1 ROS production (Rotenone),
as well as inhibitors for alternative cytoplasmic sources
of ROS production, namely oxidative xanthine oxidase
(Allopurinol) and NADPH-oxidase (Apocynin). Addition
of Allopurinol and Apocynin significantly increased ROS
production, as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Addition
of Rotenone yielded ROS production similar to vehicletreated control and a significant difference was observed
in comparison to Allopurinol and Apocynin treatment.
Therefore, only Rotenone reduced 4-HNE-mediated
ROS production, suggesting that the process is specific
to mitochondrial respiration, which is further supported
by the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential

Generation of mitochondrial ROS is produced in
response to 4-HNE
During oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species
accumulate due to the inability of the cell to detoxify
them, leading to the production of oxygenated species
that can react with protein, inducing cellular damage and
effecting energy production [10, 18]. Since our results
confirm that 4-HNE inhibits mitochondrial oxygen
consumption, we investigated the production of total ROS
within SAECs in the presence of 4-HNE. SAECs were
treated with 5, 10, 25 μM of 4-HNE and compared to
vehicle-treated cells (Figure 6A). All tested concentrations
of 4-HNE produced significant increases in ROS activity,
when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Vehicle

provide strong evidence that 4-HNE structurally modifies
Trx by targeting cysteine residues, ultimately impacting
Trx functionality.

Time dependent Trx depletion and activity
suppression by 4-HNE

DISCUSSION

Trx proteins provide protection during oxidative
stress, due to their antioxidant properties [15]. However,
4-HNE is known to target disulfide bonds, a hallmark
of thyroxine containing proteins [13, 16]. To further
explain the process by which 4-HNE induces cellular
and mitochondrial damage, we measured total Trx in
SAECs. SAECs were treated with 25μM 4-HNE and total
Trx was measured at 10, 20, 30, and 60 min (Figure 7A).
Compared to vehicle-treated controls, our results indicate
a significant 40% reduction of total Trx at 30 min, as well
as 60% reduction in total Trx at 60 min. Although total Trx
was similar to baseline conditions at 10 min, exposure to
4-HNE over time further reduced total Trx. These results
suggest that 4-HNE modifies Trx proteins and impairs
their function within the cell. We additionally investigated
Trx activity in SAECs. Cells were similarly treated with
25 μM 4-HNE and compared to vehicle-treated controls.
Total Trx activity was measured at 10, 20, 30, and 60 min
time intervals (Figure 7B). There was a time-dependent
decrease in Trx activity in response to 4-HNE indicative
of protein modification. Trx activity was significantly
lowered by 44% at 20 min, with an additional suppression
of 63% at 30 min. After 1 h Trx activity decreased by
80% relative to the vehicle-treated controls. Our results

Oxidative stress mediated by the production of
ROS and 4-HNE is associated with the pathogenesis of
lung disease, such as acute lung injury [29]. Although
4-HNE is endogenously produced and metabolized,
under oxidative stress the intrinsic cellular detoxifying
responses become overwhelmed and oxidized lipids
begin to accumulate, inducing cellular injury [6, 12, 30].
Furthermore, it is known that antioxidants, such as Trx
proteins, serve a protective role by responding to oxidants
and directly reducing oxidized species [13, 14]. However,
the accumulation of reactive lipid by-products impairs the
mitochondrial capacity to compensate for the increased
energy demand [8]. Consequently, the relation between
hyperoxia, 4-HNE and mitochondrial dysfunction warrants
further investigation in order to ameliorate mechanisms of
lung injury.
We investigated the effects of hyperoxic conditions
in vivo and found significant increases in 4-HNE mediated
protein modification of mice lung tissue after prolonged
exposure time of 48 and 72 hours. Previously we have
shown that hyperoxic conditions result in alveolar protein
leak, pulmonary edema, and increased lung ceramide
levels, representative of the damaging responses in acute
lung injury [31]. In vivo studies have shown that induced

caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis. Previously, we have
shown in vivo a suppression of caspase-3 levels in response
to the deletion of NLRP3, involved in inflammasome
activation, which attenuated hyperoxia-induced oxidative
damage [26]. Furthermore, inflammatory responses,
including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, are
also associated with proapoptotic molecules (i.e. BAX
or BCL-2 associated protein) and cell death induced by
hyperoxic lung injury [31]. In response to the production
of reactive aldehydes, epithelial cells can experience
an aggregation of leukocytes to the lung airspaces,
subsequently promoting an increase in inflammation [8,
37]. 4-HNE has been shown to induce the expression of
inflammatory factors, such as COX-2, and regulate the
transcription factor NF-kB which further stimulates the
expression of inflammatory cytokines [36, 38, 39]. Thus,
4-HNE is associated with various processes of cellular
dysfunction and tissue damage, and can contribute to the
pathogenesis of disease.
It has been well established that oxidative
stress and the generation of reactive aldehydes affect
mitochondrial function [11, 21]. Necessary processes
of mitochondria, such as oxygen consumption and ATP
synthesis become impaired when compensating for the
increased energy demand during oxidative stress [40].
Our current findings also support impaired mitochondrial
function by reduced ATP levels, Aconitase activity
and mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibited
mitochondrial OCR and reserve capacity. Reduction
of ATP levels suggest incapacity of SAECs to meet
energy demands and decreased respiration efficiency.
Furthermore, the ability of SAECs to detoxify 4-HNE
is diminished since these processes require energy as
well [8]. Damage to mitochondrial membrane protein is
devastating for cellular survival since the mitochondrial
respiratory chain (complexes I-V) is essential for ATP

hyperoxic conditions by direct mechanisms (i.e. treatment
with 4-HNE) or by secondary mechanisms (e.g. cardiac
inhibition), stimulate the production of 4-HNE-Protein
adducts [10, 11]. Ultimately, protein modification will
disrupt the normal functioning of cells, impairing their
ability to mediate the response to oxidative stress and
ROS production [4]. Inability of proteins to function
at desirable capacity will contribute to overall cellular
dysfunction and death. Additionally, we have shown an
increase in MDA levels in mice lung homogenates after 72
h. The concentration of 4-HNE-protein adducts and MDA
have been shown to be highly correlated in samples of
human plasma/serum obtained from obese patients, when
compared to controls, signifying that these molecules
serve as biomarkers for oxidative stress [4].
For the first time, we provide evidence of the
damaging effects of 4-HNE in human SAECs, which have
been understudied. In response to hyperoxic lung injury
and additional pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epithelial
cells are vulnerable to damage [32]. The function of these
cells is essential for preserving the pathway for air to and
from the alveoli, and combatting inhaled environmental
particulate matter and pathogens [19, 32, 33]; thus, they
serve a critical role in protecting against lung injury.
Results of our cell viability assays demonstrate 4-HNEinduced SAEC dysfunction. Oxidative stress is known
to promote mechanisms of cellular dysfunction, such
as DNA fragmentation, ATP depletion, rupture of the
cell membrane, as well as apoptosis [7, 9]. Stimulation
of apoptosis signaling and pro-apoptotic pathways, such
as p53, is known to be induced by various oxidants and
4-HNE [3, 27, 34, 35]. Lipid peroxidation reactions
compromise cellular membrane integrity and can mediate
apoptosis [36], which is supported by our findings of
reduced cellular viability and increased activity of cleaved

reducing equivalents [9, 40]. Mitochondrial reserve
capacity is considered to be exceptionally important
when responding to stress, acting as an additional
mechanism in which energy demands can be met, and
if exhausted will contribute to protein modification and
cell death. This is reinforced by our findings of 4-HNEProtein adducts and reduced cellular viability [8, 40].
Consequently, 4-HNE inhibits mitochondrial respiration,
suggestive of its role in impairing mitochondrial function,
and inducing apoptosis and cellular death. Furthermore,
addition of ROS inhibitors to SAECs revealed specificity
of ROS production to the mitochondrial respiratory chain
complex I. Previous studies corroborate that 4-HNE
mediated ROS release is associated with mitochondrial
respiratory chain complex 1 [41]. Generation of ROS by
mitochondrial membrane protein complex I can easily
affect mitochondrial function since these oxidized species
do not have to be transported from the cytosol [41, 42].
Evidence of the attenuation of ROS production in response
to rotenone has been provided previously, which further
indicates that respiratory complex 1 is a major source of
ROS release [42]. Conversely, other studies suggest that
the release of mitochondrial ROS was induced in cells
treated with rotenone [43]. However, these studies did not
specifically study hyperoxia or 4-HNE induced oxidative
stress. This may suggest that further research is required
to elucidate the exact mechanisms of rotenone regarding
ROS release and 4-HNE, and the possibility that rotenone
is mediated by other processes or molecules.
To counteract mitochondrial ROS, we investigated
the effects of 4-HNE on Trx proteins in SAECs. Total
Trx and Trx activity was found to be reduced in a timedependent response, suggesting protein modification.
In response to hyperoxic lung injury, it has been
demonstrated that higher expressions of Trx-dependent
mechanisms provide resistance to hyperoxia [13]. Trx
proteins, such as mitochondrial Trx2 can metabolize
reactive hydrogen peroxide species, providing an
antioxidant response [14]. In agreement with other
studies, induced oxidative stress by 4-HNE caused cell
death, yet Trx2 served a protective role by maintaining
mitochondrial function and cell viability, while also
inhibiting Hsp70 expression, a protein upregulated in
response to oxidative stress [17]. Intracellular loss of
Trx levels in our results indicate that ubiquitination and
proteasome degradation may be involved in cellular and
mitochondrial damage mediated by 4-HNE. This supports
previous research on protein degradation by 4-HNE,
which show that enzyme functionality becomes inhibited
and protein conformation can potentially be altered in the
presence of 4-HNE [4]. Our current findings of 4-HNEProtein adduct formation additionally supports 4-HNE
mediated protein degradation. Therefore, inhibition of
Trx functionality supports our findings of reduced cellular
function, ATP levels, oxygen consumption, and increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mitochondrial ROS production.
In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first
time that 4-HNE elicits damaging effects on human
SAECs. We show that hyperoxic conditions increased the
production of 4-HNE-Protein adducts and MDA levels,
signifying their importance as biomarkers of oxidative
stress. 4-HNE was shown to reduce SAEC viability
and upregulate cleaved caspase-3 activity, a marker of
apoptosis. Mitochondrial function was impaired, which
reduced oxygen consumption, Aconitase activity, and
mitochondrial reserve capacity. JC-1 staining indicated
reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in response
to 4-HNE. SAEC total ROS production was increased in
the presence of 4-HNE and shown to be associated with
mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Furthermore,
4-HNE inhibited the activity of total Trx proteins,
suggesting binding by 4-HNE, and further impairing
mitochondrial protective antioxidant properties. Because
oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of
many diseases and lung epithelial cells are particularly
susceptible to oxidative cellular injury [22], targeting
4-HNE in SAECs may provide a novel therapeutic
approach to ameliorate hyperoxic lung injury. Taken
together, our results signify the importance of remediating
4-HNE induced oxidative cellular and mitochondrial
damage within SAECs, in order to maintain intrinsic
biological function for cellular survival.

experiment, every 3 hours. Cells were incubated for an
additional hour to perform cell viability assays and JC-1
staining.

Reagents

Cell viability assays

Cell culture growth media, fetal bovine serum (FBS),
and buffers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.
(Grand Island, NY) or Lonza (Walkersville, MD). 4-HNE
was purchased from (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann
Arbor, MI). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma
(St Louis, MO). A BCA assay kit was used to determine

MTT
[3,-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay was used to assess
cell viability, according to methods previously described
[37, 44]. Briefly, SAECs were treated with 5, 10, and
25 μM 4-HNE, then incubated for 1 hour. Cells were
then treated with yellow MTT (0.5 mg/ml) per well and
incubated for 2 hours at 37oC. Medium was removed, and
resultant purple formazan crystals were dissolved in 250μl
DMSO. Absorbance of formazan products was measured
at 570nm. Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay protocol was
described previously [45]. SAECs were treated with 5, 10,
and 25 μM 4-HNE, then incubated for 1 hour. Cells were
then treated with Trypan blue dye (0.04% in PBS) after
exposure to H2O2 for 1 hour, placed on a hemocytometer to
determine cell count, and examined by light microscopy.
Viable and dead (blue) cells were counted out of a total of
200 cells, with results expressed as percentage of viable
cells.

Measurement of 4-HNE-Protein adducts and
MDA levels
4-HNE Protein adducts and MDA levels were
measured in mice to determine whether toxic lipid
peroxidation aldehydes would be produced in response to
hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress. C57BL/6J mice (N =
6) were exposed to normoxia, as well as hyperoxia for
24, 48, and 72 hours. Lungs were isolated and perfused
with cold 0.9% NaCl with 0.1% glucose, 30 mM HEPES,
6mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 0.07 mg/ml
penicillin G, 0.07 mg/ml EGTA, and 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), as previously described [9]. Homogenates were
then centrifuged at 3,000g for 10 min at 4oC and 200 µL
of the supernatant was removed. 4-HNE-Protein adduct
levels were measured by an OxiSelect HNE-His Adduct
ELISA kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Cell
Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA). On a 96-well plate, protein
samples and standards (10 µg/ml) were absorbed for 2
hrs at 37oC. Protein was probed with anti-HNE Histidine
(His) antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase
secondary antibody. Protein levels were compared with a
standard curve produced from HNE-BSA standards. MDA
levels were measured in mice lung homogenates with a
Lipid Peroxidation (MDA) Assay Kit (Colorimetric/
Fluorometric) ab118970 (abcam, Cambridge, MA), after
washing with cold PBS. MDA levels were also compared
with a MDA standard curve, prepared from MDA
Standard.

Determination of caspase-3 activity
Cleaved Caspase-3 activity was measured in
SAECs treated with 5-25 µM 4-HNE and assessed using
a colorimetric assay kit (R&D systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA), as per manufacturer’s guidelines. Caspase-3
colorimetric substrate, DEV-pNA, was used to perform the
enzymatic reaction in 96 well plates at 37oC, as previously
described [46]. Caspase activity was determined by using
a micro-plate reader.

Quantification of percent ATP levels
SAECs were treated with 5, 10, and 25 μM 4-HNE
and compared to control cells that were treated with
vehicle (0.1% ethanol). Percent ATP levels were measured
using a bioluminescent assay (Berthold Systems,
Aliquippa, PA) with recombinant firefly luciferase and its
substrate D-luciferin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as
described previously [25]. Light produced was detected by
a luminometer (Berthold Systems, Aliquippa, PA).

Cell culture

Aconitase assay

SAECs were maintained in SABM medium
(Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10%
FBS, Penicillin (100 u/ml) Streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and
Clonetics SAGM SingleQuots (Lonza) at 37oC in a 5%
CO2 humidified incubator, in order to maintain adequate
cell growth. Cultured cells deemed confluent were treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Mitochondrial Aconitase activity was determined in
cell lysates using an Aconitase Assay kit (OxisResearch,
Foster City, CA), according to manufacturer’s instructions
and methods previously described elsewhere [27, 28].

Aconitase activity was represented in μU/min/mg of
mitochondrial protein. Conversion of citrate into isocitrate
was determined by measuring absorbance at 340 nm for 30
min at 37oC, and monitoring NADPH production.

oxidation of the cell permeable fluorescent probe 2’,
7’-Dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) to
2’, 7’-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) by ROS was
measured. Cells were treated with 10 μM DCFH-DA for
30 min in the absence of light at room temperature, as
previously described [27]. Fluorescence intensity was
proportional to the ROS levels within the cell cytosol
and compared to a DCF standard curve. A fluorescence
microplate reader was used to measure absorbance at
480 nm excitation and 530 nm emission. Inhibitors,
1mM apocynin, 100 μM allopurinol and 1 μM rotenone,
were added to study their effects within SEACs and the
mitochondria.

Oxygen consumption rate
Bioenergetic parameters were evaluated by using
XF analysis (Seahorse Biosciences, Chicopee, MA), as
previously described [8, 40]. Briefly, one hour before
assay measurements were taken, culture medium was
removed and replaced with unbuffered Dulbecco’s
modified Eagles/ medium (pH 7.4). After baseline oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) measurements (pmol/O2/min),
oligomycin (1 μg/ml), FCCP (1μM), and antimycin A
(10 μM) were injected consecutively through Seahorse
Flux Pak cartridges and documented after each injection.
Oligomycin was used to measure non-ATP linked OCR,
FCCP was used to determine maximal mitochondrial
respiration, and antimycin A was used to measure nonmitochondrial OCR.

Trx quantification
Trx levels were quantified using an Enzyme Linked
Immunoassay (ELISA) kit (Cedarlane Laboratories,
Burlington, NC), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, lung protein extracts was immobilized on a 96well plate, then blocked for 1 hour at room temperature
with blocking buffer and 0.05% Tween 20. Plates were
washed with Tris-buffered saline and phosphate buffered
saline, containing 0.05% Tween 20. Antigen was probed
with primary monoclonal anti-HNE antibody (Alpha
Diagnostic Intl, San Antonio, TX) diluted 1000 fold.

Mitochondrial JC-1 staining
SAECs were maintained in SABM medium
(Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS, Penicillin (100
u/ml) Streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and Clonetics SAGM
SingleQuots (Lonza) at 37oC in a 5% CO2 humidified
incubator. The cells were plated at a density of 2 X 105
cells/ml in a 12 mm Nunc glass bottom dish (Thermo
Scientific). The cells were treated with different
concentration of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (10-100 µM)
or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) at 37oC for 15 min. Following
washes, cells were incubated with 10 µg/ml of JC-1
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) at 37oC for 15 min and
cells were washed three times and placed in the constituted
medium. We performed live cell imaging using 3i Spinning
disk confocal microscope (Olympus, Pittsburgh, PA). The
monomer was excited by 488 nm argon-ion laser, whereas
the J-aggregate forms were excited selectively using the
568 argon-krypton laser line. Polarized mitochondria
were visualized as punctate orange red fluorescence. On
depolarization, the fluorescence changed from orange
red to green. The images were processed using Adobe
Photoshop CS6. Magnification = 60X. Image J software
was used to quantify JC-1 aggregates, with mean intensity
expressed as Arbitrary Units.

Determination of Trx activity
Trx activity was determined enzymatically in
cultured cells, according to methods described elsewhere
[47, 48], including TrxR activity for comparison. 100 μl
of 10.1% Triton X-100/PBS was used to induce cell lysis
and a 5 μl aliquot was analyzed for protein concentration
using BioRad protein assay (Hercules, CA), with bovine
serum albumin (BSA) included as the standard. Protein
was combined with 137 μl of reaction mixture [0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM NADPH, and 75
nM rat TR]. Insulin-reducing assay was used, according
to methods previously described, to determine Trx activity
[48]. The reaction was evaluated by spectrophotometric
analysis, recording the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm
each 30 seconds in a 5 minute time span, to monitor the
oxidation of NADPH. The control samples were subjected
to the same treatment, except in the absence of insulin.
ΔA340 of control samples were subtracted from the ΔA340 of
each experimental sample. Calculated values were plotted
on a standard curve to determine the absolute amounts of
Trx in the cell extract.

Measurement of Total ROS

Statistical analysis

ROS production (hydroxyl, peroxyl, other
ROS) was evaluated in SAECs by using an OxiSelect
Intracellular ROS Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San
Diego, CA). Cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and
