ABSTRACT
ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease Domain 10) affects the
pathophysiology of various cancers, and we had shown that inhibition of ADAM10
sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. ADAM10 is activated in response
to calcium influx, and here we examined if calcium channel blockers (CCB) would
impede ADAM10 activation and affect biology of pancreatic cancer cells. We find
that the CCB, fendiline, significantly reduces proliferation, migration, invasion, and
anchorage independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells. This was associated with
ADAM10 inhibition and its localization at the actin-rich membrane protrusions.
Further, fendiline-treated cells formed cadherin-catenin positive tight adherens
junctions and elicited defective protein trafficking and recycling. Furthermore, the
expression of β-catenin target genes, cyclinD1, c-Myc and CD44, were significantly
decreased, suggesting that fendiline might prevent cell proliferation and migration by
inhibiting ADAM10 function, cadherin proteolysis and stabilization of cadherin-catenin
interaction at the plasma membrane. This will subsequently diminish β-catenin
intracellular signaling and repress TCF/LEF target gene expression. Supporting
this notion, RNAi-directed downregulation of ADAM10 in cancer cells decreased the
expression of cyclinD1, c-Myc and CD44. Furthermore, analysis of human pancreatic
tumor tissue microarrays and lysates showed elevated levels of ADAM10, suggesting
that aberrant activation of ADAM10 plays a fundamental role in growth and metastasis
of PDACs and inhibiting this pathway might be a viable strategy to combat PDACs.

INTRODUCTION

nucleoside analog gemcitabine remains the standard drug
for chemotherapy but it increases patient survival only
marginally [2] and use of newly developed combinatorial
therapies have been overshadowed by toxicity issues
thereby emphasizing the need for better treatment
strategies [3-6].

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the United States and shows
less than 6% survival rate according to the Facts and

It has been found that inhibition of L-type and
store operated calcium entry (SOCE) associated channels
abrogates proliferation and invasion of cancer cells,
implying that calcium influx might contribute to cancer
progression and metastasis [7-15]. Studies in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells have shown that
expression of the SOCE-associated ORAI1 and STIM1
is associated with gemcitabine-resistance and their
downregulation increases sensitivity to gemcitabine [16].
Another study has shown that the L-type calcium channel
blocker (CCB) fendiline inhibits cancer cell proliferation,
specifically in cells expressing mutant K-Ras, by altering
K-Ras cellular distribution and downstream signaling
[17]. Furthermore, the L-type CCBs, nifedipine, diltiazem
and verapamil, have been shown to inhibit cancer cell
proliferation by altering calcium activated potassium
channels in PDAC cells [18]. Altogether, these data
suggest that inclusion of CCBs would potentially prevent
aberrant calcium signaling and inhibit proliferation and
drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells.	
Recent studies from our lab have shown that
inhibition of ADAM10 enhances sensitivity of cancer
cells to gemcitabine [19]. ADAM10 is a sheddase that
cleaves ectodomains of transmembrane proteins such
as E-cadherins, N-cadherins, Notch, CD44 and amyloid
precursor protein (APP), which play a significant role in
proliferation, migration, invasion or stemness of cancer
cells [20-37]. Since ADAM10 is activated in response to
calcium influx [38, 39], we hypothesized that inhibition
of calcium influx would abrogate ADAM10 activation
and negate the oncogenic properties of PDAC cells.
Furthermore, a search of the Total Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) portal showed that calcium channel subunits are
altered in human PDACs, emphasizing the importance of
aberrant calcium signaling in pancreatic cancer initiation
and/or progression. Here we examined whether the
established CCBs interfere with ADAM10 signaling and
oncogenicity in PDAC cells. While the CCBs elicited an
inhibitory effect on proliferation and invasion of cancer
cells the concentrations required to see significant effect
varied considerably. Among the CCBs fendiline and
the SOCE inhibitor, SKF96365, showed the best results
at a reasonably low concentration and since fendiline
is already approved for treatment of angina in patients,
we carried out additional studies using this agent. Our
results show that fendiline treatment led to the formation
of cadherin-catenin positive tight adherens junctions,
reduced expression of β-catenin target genes and defective
vesicular trafficking and recycling of ADAM10 and its
substrates to the plasma membrane. Downregulation
of ADAM10 using specific siRNAs showed inhibition
of cyclinD1, c-Myc and CD44, a few of the β-cateninTCF/LEF targets implying the significance of ADAM10
signaling in expression of these proliferation associated
proteins. Furthermore, supporting the importance of
ADAM10 in pancreatic cancer, we found that expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of ADAM10 is enhanced in primary PDAC tissues and
TMAs. PDACs also showed enhanced expression of
c-Myc, suggesting that ADAM10 activation and β-cateninTCF signaling might be responsible for the increased
expression of c-Myc and targeting specific calciumdependent signaling mechanisms that are altered in PDAC
might be a viable strategy for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer. Since many of the L-type CCBs are clinically
used for treatment of various cardiac abnormalities, an
elucidation of their potential role in inhibition of cancer
cell growth and invasion will enable the repurposing of
these agents to combat PDAC.

RESULTS
Calcium channel blockers induce cytotoxicity in
pancreatic cancer cells
Since the calcium channel blockers that we are
interested in are known to elicit their effect by acting
as an antagonist of voltage gated calcium influx or
store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), we searched
the Total Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) portal for
alterations in these channels in PDAC [40-42]. The data
showed that human PDACs show alterations in L-type
(CACNA1S, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1F)
T-type (CACNA1G, CACNA1H, CACNA1I), R-type
(CACNA1E), N-type (CACNA1B) and P/Q-type
(CACNA1A) calcium channel subunits, as well as the
SOCE-associated ORAI3 and STIM1 (Figure 1A). This
suggests that aberrancies in calcium signaling might play a
role in PDAC initiation and progression and that inhibition
of calcium influx might prevent cancer growth. To test the
effect of calcium channel inhibition, we performed studies
on PDAC cell lines treated with or without CCBs. We
treated MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 cells with L-type calcium
channel blockers such as fendiline, nifedipine, verapapmil,
diltiazem, isradipine, or the SOCE inhibitor SKF96365,
which is known to inhibit STIM1 and voltage gated
calcium channels. The reason for choosing Panc1 and
MiaPaCa2 is that our earlier studies have shown that these
two cell lines exhibit mesenchymal characteristics and are
more resistant to treatment with gemcitabine compared
to CD18 cells, which is epithelial in nature [19]. Studies
using 1µM to 100µm of the various CCBs showed that
most of them reduced cell viability only at relatively
high concentrations (50-100µM) except for fendiline and
SKF96365, which showed significant effects at 15µM
and 10µM, respectively (Figure 1B and 1C). The exact
nature of the different voltage gated calcium channels
expressed by Panc1 or MiaPaCa2 cells are unknown.
Studies by others have shown that Panc1 cells express
the L-type calcium channel subunit CACNA1C (Cav1.2)
[43] and MiaPaCa2 express T-type calcium channels [44].

Also, studies using both L-type (verapamil, diltiazem
and nifedipine) and T-type (phenytoin) calcium channel
antagonists have shown anti-proliferative effects on these
cancer cells implying that they express voltage gated
calcium channels [7, 18]. Since we observed best results
with fendiline, which has been approved for treatment of
angina in cardiac patients [45, 46], we performed further
studies using this calcium channel antagonist.

effectively inhibit cell proliferation as compared to
15µM of the drug used in Panc1 cells (Figure 1D and
1E). Western blotting using an antibody to cleaved PARP
showed that cells treated with fendiline show increased
PARP cleavage in MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 cells, indicative
of apoptosis (Figure 1F and 1G), whereas nifedipine had
only a minimal effect; we did not observe any increase in
PARP cleavage upon co-treatment of cells with fendiline
and gemcitabine, indicating that these two drugs do not
show additive or synergistic effects. All together, these
data suggest that fendiline exerts significant cytotoxic
effects on pancreatic cancer cells and would potentially
be beneficial as a single agent or in combination with other
chemotherapeutic drugs in treating pancreatic cancers that
do not respond to gemcitabine therapy.
These results show that although CCBs induce
cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells, their efficacy vary
significantly. The L-type CCBs we tested belong to the
dihydropyridine (eg: nifedipine and isradipine), nondihydropyridine (phenylalkylamines, eg: fendiline and
verapamil) or benzothiazepine (diltiazem) class. Fendiline
is a lipophilic calcium antagonist and is shown to bind both
calcium channels and calmodulin with similar affinities
[45]. Although fendiline elicits similar potencies as
nifedipine and verapamil under certain situations, chronic
exposure to fendiline has been shown to enhance its antianginal effect, indicating that these drugs act differently.
It is possible that this effect of fendiline is brought about
by either a calmodulin-mediated mechanism or through
its stabilization by incorporation in to the membrane lipid
bilayer [47].

Fendiline enhances cytotoxicity and inhibits
proliferation of cancer cells
To determine if the CCBs enhance sensitivity of
cancer cells to gemcitabine, MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 cells
were treated with 15µM fendiline, 15µM nifedipine,
100ng/ml gemcitabine or a combination of these drugs for
24h, and cell viability was assessed. Nifedipine at 15µM
did not have any effect by itself or in combination with
gemcitabine. At the same time, treatment of cells with
fendiline induced significant cytotoxicity but co-treatment
with gemcitabine and fendiline did not have an added
cytotoxic effect, suggesting that fendiline is capable of
inducing significant cytotoxicity by itself (data not shown).
To assess whether fendiline or nifedipine affects cell
proliferation, BrdU incorporation assays were performed.
Analysis of Panc1 and MiaPaCa2 cells treated with 15µM
fendiline or nifedipine for 24h showed that fendiline could
significantly inhibit the proliferation of both cell types,
whereas nifedipine at this concentration was ineffective.
MiaPaCa2 was found to be more susceptible to fendiline
than Panc1, since 7.5µM fendiline was sufficient to

Fendiline treatment induces G1 arrest in
pancreatic cancer cells

that treatment of MiaPaCa2 (Figure 2A, 2B and 2E) and
Panc1 (Figure 2C, 2D and 2F) cells with fendiline for 24h
resulted in significant enrichment of cells in the G1 phase.
There was a corresponding reduction in the number of
cells in S and G2 phases, suggesting a G1/S arrest (Figure
2E and 2F). These results, along with the data from BrdU
incorporation studies suggest that fendiline inhibits PDAC
cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest.

Since BrdU analysis showed reduced cell
proliferation upon fendiline treatment, we performed
propidium iodide staining followed by FACS analysis to
assess changes in the cell cycle. Cells were trypsinized and
cultured for 24h prior to treatment for 24h. It was found

with fendiline drastically reduces the invasion of cells,
compared to untreated controls (Figure 3C); invasion
was also abolished in MiaPaCa2 cells (data not shown).
To examine migration, a wound-healing assay was
performed on Panc1 or MiaPaCa2 (data not shown) cells
grown to confluence in 12 well dishes. Cells were treated
with or without fendiline and wound area was measured
within 30min. after making the wound, and after 12h

and 24h. Data presented in Figure 3D and 3E show that
fendiline treatment significantly reduced the migration, as
measured by the percentage of the uncovered wound area
in comparison to the initial area of the wound measured
at 30min. These results support the anti-proliferative and
anti-invasive effects of fendiline on pancreatic cancer
cells.

Fendiline promotes tight cadherin-catenin
positive adherens junction formation and inhibits
expression of β-catenin target genes

Given the reduction in the levels of β-catenin
upon fendiline treatment, additional experiments were
conducted to assess the expression of β-catenin target
genes. β-catenin is known to interact with T-cell factor
(TCF) / Lymphoid-enhancing factor (LEF) family of
transcription factors to induce gene expression [22, 5053]. Western blotting conducted on MiaPaCa2 and Panc1
cells showed that expression of the β-catenin targets cyclin D1, c-Myc and CD44 - was reduced upon fendiline
treatment (Figure 5A-5F). These results agree with the
enhanced membrane stabilization and reduced nuclear
localization of β-catenin in fendiline treated cells. This
also indicates that fendiline affects multiple aspects of
pancreatic cancer cell biology, including signaling events
mediated by β-catenin.

Pancreatic cancer cells are known to undergo EMT
(Epithelial to mesenchymal transition), which promotes
their invasive and metastatic potential [48, 49]. Western
blot analysis have shown that Panc1 cells express
N-Cadherin [19]; fendiline treatment did not significantly
increase the expression of E-cadherin in MiaPaCa2 or
Panc1 cells as analyzed by real time PCR (data not shown).
This indicates that the reduced migration might not be
brought about by enhanced expression of E-cadherin.
To assess whether fendiline affects cellular distribution
of N-cadherin, we performed immunostaining analysis
on Panc1 cells; for all the immunostaining analyses we
chose these cells due to their flat morphology compared to
MiaPaCa2 cells. Cells were treated with 15µM fendiline
for 24h, fixed and analyzed using N-cadherin and β-catenin
antibodies. Results showed enhanced co-localization of
N-cadherin with β-catenin at the membranes and at the
adherens junctions, with a concomitant reduction in the
intracellular levels of β-catenin (Figure 4), indicative
of stabilization of the catenin at the adherens junctions.
Fendiline treated wells showed a significant reduction in
cell number and the cells appeared to form tight adhesion
between adjacent cells, suggesting that, in addition to
inhibition of proliferation, fendiline enhances intercellular
adhesions, contributing to reduced migration and invasion.

Fendiline affects cellular distribution and function
of ADAM10
To determine if fendiline affects the levels or
distribution of ADAM10, immunocytochemistry as well
as western blotting was done on Panc1 cells. Since we
observed an increase in the levels of N-cadherin at the
adherens junctions (Figure 4B), Panc1 cells were treated
with or without 15µM fendiline for 24h and co-stained
with N-cadherin and ADAM10 antibodies. ADAM10 was
heavily localized at the plasma membrane protrusions in
untreated cells, indicative of its role in cell detachment and
migration (arrows in Figure 6A, top panel). N-cadherin

were treated with or without fendiline 15µM and immunostained using N-Cadherin and β-catenin antibodies. Alexa Fluor 488 and 594

were used as secondary antibodies and Hoechst was used for nuclear staining. Cells treated with fendiline showed enhanced colocalization
of cadherin and catenin at the adherens junctions (arrow heads in bottom rows). Magnification: 63X.

staining was reduced in the areas of strong ADAM10
localization, possibly due to proteolytic processing of
N-cadherin by ADAM10. Fendiline treatment reduced the
localization of ADAM10 at the leading edges of the cells
and increased the levels of N-cadherin at the intercellular
adherens junctions (arrowheads in Figure 6A bottom
panel). This indicates that fendiline-mediated inhibition of
ADAM10 interferes with cadherin cleavage and stabilizes
its membrane association.
Since membrane protrusions are regions of dynamic
actin reorganization that contribute to cell motility and
migration [54], association of ADAM10 with these
leading edges suggests that it might play a role in ECM
dissolution, cell detachment and movement. To confirm
that ADAM10 indeed associates with the ruffles at
the membrane protrusions, cells were treated with or
without fendiline for 24h and co-stained with Alexa
Fluor 488-labeled Phalloidin and ADAM10 antibodies
(Figure 6B). ADAM10 showed strong staining at the
actin-rich dorsal and ventral ruffles at the membrane
protrusions (arrows in Figure 6B) and this association
was significantly reduced by fendiline. This suggests that

fendiline treatment leads to the inhibition of ADAM10
localization at the cell membrane, compromising its
function as a sheddase and abrogating ECM degradation,
cell migration and invasion.
Our published studies have shown that ADAM10
inactivation is associated with generation of an ~85kDa
fragment of the protease [19]; as shown in Figure 6C, cells
treated with fendiline showed generation of the ~85kDa
ADAM10 fragment, indicative of its inactivation. The
results described so far suggest that fendiline inhibits
ADAM10 function, increases cadherin association at the
cell membrane, and enhances cadherin-catenin positive
adherens junction formation, with a corresponding
decrease in nuclear levels of β-catenin. Since ADAM10
is known to enhance ectodomain shedding of cadherins,
these results suggest that fendiline inhibits β-catenin
signaling by interfering with ADAM10 mediated cadherin
cleavage and release of β-catenin. To test this possibility,
and to determine whether ADAM10 affects β-catenin
signaling, we downregulated ADAM10 in MiaPaCa2 by
transfecting an ADAM10 siRNA; cells transfected with a
non-targeting siRNA served as control. After confirming

well as CD44, all of which showed reduction in ADAM10
depleted cells, indicating that ADAM10 regulates catenindependent intracellular signaling in the cancer cells.

is a transmembrane protein, which is cleaved by α, β
and γ-seceretases to generate fragments with variable
cellular functions [55-57]. Since fendiline seems to
inhibit ADAM10, and because APP is known to play
a role in PDAC cell proliferation [19], we examined if
cells treated with fendiline show alterations in APP.
Immunostaining analysis on Panc1 cells showed that
fendiline treatment led to the accumulation of APP in
large intracellular vesicles, which were positive for EEA1,
an early endosomal marker (Figure 7A). There was also
increased co-localization of APP with Rab7 (Figure 7B)
but not with Rab11 (Figure 7C), which is a late endosomal
marker that is involved in membrane fusion or exocytosis

Fendiline interferes with intracellular protein
sorting and recycling
Our studies have shown that inhibition of ADAM10,
which is established as the -secretase that constitutively
cleaves APP, interferes with APP proteolysis [19]. APP

slight shift (slower migration) in the C-terminal fragment in fendiline treated samples, which confirms the increased processing of APP by
β-secretase rather than α-seceratse (ADAM10) (3rd and 4th panels in E and F). Reprobe of the blot with actin was performed to determine
protein loading on the blots. G. and H. Analysis of Panc1 cells using the lipophilic FM 1-43 FX dye shows accumulation of enlarged

fendiline affects endosomal protein sorting, and inhibits
vesicular trafficking and recycling of APP to the plasma
membrane. At the molecular level, intracellular levels of
full length APP (APPFL) were elevated in fendiline treated
cells, indicative of reduced exocytosis (Figure 7E and 7F).

associated with the plasma membrane by α-secretase [58,
59]. Analysis of APP by western blot using 6E10 antibody
showed an increase in the β-secretase cleaved C-terminal
fragment of APP, namely cAPPβ, which is recognized by
6E10 antibodies (Figure 7E and 7F). This altered APP
processing was further confirmed by western blot analysis
using a C-terminal APP antibody, which showed a slight
shift in migration of the C-terminal fragment (labeled
cAPP), indicative of altered processing and generation of
C99 (β-secretase cleaved C-terminal fragment) versus C83
(α-secretase cleaved C-terminal fragment).
To confirm the effect of fendiline on endosomal
vesicle formation and sorting, Panc1 cells were stained
with FM1-43FX, a membrane probe for activity-dependent
vesicle cycling [60]. Fluorescence microscopy of cells
incubated with FM1-43FX and treated with fendiline for
6h showed a significant increase in the number and size of
FM1-43 positive intracellular vesicles (Figure 7G and 7H).
This provides additional support to the contention that
fendiline affects endosomal sorting and recycling, leading
to the altered cellular distribution and accumulation of
APP in the intracellular vesicles.

significantly higher levels of the ~60kDa mature
ADAM10 protein (Figure 8F and 8J), and comparable
levels of GAPDH (Figure 8G). Since treatment with CCB
and ADAM10 downregulation reduce c-Myc levels, it is
possible that the increase in c-Myc observed in pancreatic
cancer tissue samples is at least partly brought about by
enhanced calcium signaling and/or ADAM10 activation.
Furthermore, TCGA data portal (Figure 8K) shows that
human PDACs exhibit amplifications and mutations
in ADAM10, MYC, VIM (vimentin), CD44, CCND1
(CyclinD1) and CTNNB1 (β-catenin), implying the
importance of interfering with the signaling associated
with these in prevention of pancreatic cancer.

DISCUSSION
While many CCBs are routinely used to treat
cardiac diseases, their role as anti-cancer agents is far less
understood. The results presented here show that the CCB
fendiline can manipulate the biology of pancreatic cancer
cells by affecting the cellular distribution of the proteolytic
enzyme ADAM10 and its substrates. The biological
function of ADAM10 as an α-secretase that cleaves APP
[26, 28] as well as cadherins, notch and CD44 is well
established [21-25, 27, 29]. An inhibition of ADAM10
is expected to abrogate cancer growth and metastasis by
interfering with the substrate proteolysis and function
[61, 62]. We find that fendiline-mediated inhibition of
ADAM10 at the membrane protrusions compromises its
enzymatic function at the cell surface, rendering it unable
to cleave cadherins, which in turn promotes cell adhesion
and tight adherens junction formation. This enhances
the cadherin-catenin association and stabilization of the
adherens junctions, with a subsequent reduction in the
levels of β-catenin and TCF/LEF-dependent cyclin D1,
c-Myc and CD44 expression. The finding that ADAM10
downregulation significantly reduces the expression of
these β-catenin target genes demonstrates the effectiveness
of inhibiting ADAM10 activity to combat cancer.
Furthermore, it is known that expression of ADAM10 is
also regulated by β-catenin/TCF-dependent signaling [63],
thereby implying a positive feed-back regulation of tumor
growth by this protease and emphasizing the importance
of inhibiting ADAM10 in inhibition of cancer progression.
.
Analysis of human PDAC samples show that
expression of both ADAM10 and c-Myc are elevated in
PDACs. Our studies show that treatment with fendiline
and knockdown of ADAM10 inhibit cyclin D1, CD44 and
c-Myc expression, raising the possibility that expression
and activation of these three proteins in PDACs may be
a reflection of aberrant calcium signaling and ADAM10
activation. Studies in breast cancer cells have shown that
expression and activity of c-Myc is regulated by ORAI3
[64], which is upregulated in PDACs (TCGA data, Figure
1A). Further, treatment of cancer cells with SKF96365

PDAC human samples show increased expression
of ADAM10
Since ADAM10 appears to affect cell proliferation
and migration, we examined if ADAM10 is altered in
PDACs. Towards this, we analyzed ADAM10 levels
by immunohistochemistry in human PDAC tissue
microarrays that contained duplicate samples representing
normal pancreas, islet cell tumor, and Stage I, II and III
adenocarcinomas with regional or distant metastasis.
ADAM10 was elevated in the tumor samples, with grade I
adenocarcinoma showing a significant increase (p=0.016);
Grade II and III tumors showed an increase, which did
not reach significance (Figure 8A-8C). This suggests that
ADAM10 activation might play a role in tumor initiation,
subsequently enhancing proteolysis of substrates that
could promote tumor progression and metastasis.
Additionally, we analyzed the levels of vimentin
(Figure 8D and 8H) and c-Myc (Figure 8E and 8I) in
tumors from 21 PDAC patients, or normal pancreas
form 5 patients by western blotting; their expression
was significantly elevated in PDAC compared to
normal tissues. Additionally, these samples also showed

islet cell tumor and Grade I, II and III PDAC tissue samples were immunostained using an ADAM10 antibody A. and intensity of the
stained sections were measured by Dr. Coppola, Senior Pathologist at Moffitt Cancer Center. The stain was semiquantitatively scored based
on the intensity of the stain as negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2) and strong (3). In all cases at least 34% of the tumor was positive, which
is shown in B. The bargraph in C. shows that ADAM10 levels are increased in tumor tissues, with Grade 1 tumors showing a significant
increase. D.-J. Expression of vimentin, c-Myc and ADAM10 are significantly increased in PDAC: PDAC tissue samples and samples from
normal pancreas were analyzed by western blot using vimentin (D. and H.), c-Myc (E. and I.) and ADAM10 (F. and J.) antibodies and
blots were reprobed with GAPDH antibody for normalization of proteins. K. Graph plotted using the data derived from TCGA portal show
that PDAC human samples show increased alterations, especially amplification and/or mutation, in ADAM10, β-catenin (CTNNB1), cyclin
D1 (CCND1), CD44, Myc (MYC) and vimentin (VIM). L. Proposed signaling mechanisms by which calcium dysregulation enhances
ADAM10-mediated tumor progression: Based on our data with fendiline we hypothesize that calcium influx induces ADAM10 activation,
leading to enhanced cadherin cleavage, release of β-catenin, its nuclear translocation and activation of TCF/LEF containing promoters.
This enhances expression of genes associated with proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition and metastasis of cancers such as
c-Myc, cyclin D1 and CD44. Additionally, β-catenin/TCF signaling has been shown to enhance ADAM10 expression thereby playing a
feed-forward role in ADAM10-mediated downstream signaling and promotion of oncogenic cycle. In addition to this indirect activation
of β-catenin-TCF signaling, ADAM10-mediated cleavage of substrates such as cadherins and CD44 allow detachment of cell-cell and
cell-substratum adhesions, migration and invasion of cancer cells. Our data indicate that inhibitors of calcium channels prevent ADAM10dependent signaling and expression of c-Myc, cyclin D1 and CD44, by stabilizing cadherin-catenin interaction at the cell membrane,
enhancing adherens junction formation, subsequently reducing p-catenin-TCF/LEF signaling and target gene expression.

showed reduced viability of cancer cells (Figure 1B and
1C) supporting a role for store operated calcium entry
in cancer cell survival and proliferation. These results
suggest that targeting the altered calcium signaling impairs
tumor growth by interfering with expression or function of
tumor promoting proteins, such as c-Myc, ADAM10 and
β-catenin. Whether specific calcium channels on cancer
cells are modulated by fendiline or whether it brings about
the effects through interfering with a calcium-dependent
or independent pathway is unclear. Since fendiline is
known to have antagonistic effects on calmodulin, it is
quite possible that a calmodulin-dependent mechanism is
abrogated upon treatment of cancer cells with fendiline.
Furthermore, fendiline has been shown to interfere
with K-Ras cellular distribution and function in various
cancer cells [17]. Our studies show that, in addition to
the β-catenin-TCF/LEF-dependent target gene regulation,
fendiline also interferes with the vesicular trafficking,
recycling and membrane targeting of ADAM10 and its
substrates. Calcium influx has been shown to play a role
in Rab-dependent vesicle recycling, membrane docking
and exocytosis of proteins [65]. Here we demonstrate that
Panc1 cells treated with fendiline show APP accumulation
in the EEA1 and Rab7 positive early and late endosomes,
respectively, but not in the Rab11 positive recycling and
exocytosis-associated endosomes, indicative of defective
recycling and membrane targeting of APP. Similar
results were seen with another substrate of ADAM10,
namely Notch (data not presented here). The inhibition of
membrane targeting interferes with the cellular functions
of APP and Notch, which includes signaling associated
with enhanced growth, EMT, migration, invasion and
stemness of cancer cells [19, 34, 66-68]. Studies have
shown that ADAM10 recycling and membrane targeting
is regulated by the small GTPase Rab14 [69]. Therefore,
it is possible that the defective membrane association of
ADAM10 in fendiline treated cells is brought about by an
inhibition of the Rab14-dependent recycling machinery.
This suggests that one of the mechanisms by which
aberrant calcium signaling enhances cancer cell growth
and metastasis could be through enhanced Rab-mediated
recruitment of ADAM10 and its substrates to the plasma
membrane, where ADAM10 actively cleaves its substrates,
such as cadherins, CD44, Notch and APP, to promote
growth, EMT, migration, invasion and metastasis of
cancer cells. Fendiline treatment led to defective recycling
of endocytosed vesicles and accumulation of membranetargeted proteins in the early endosomes. Thus, it appears
that, in addition to interfering with β-catenin-TCF/LEF
signaling and target gene expression, fendiline exerts its
effects by interfering with small GTPases involved in
protein trafficking and recycling, leading to enhanced
accumulation of proteins in the trans-Golgi network,
thereby causing cytotoxicity and cell death in cancer cells.
All together, the data presented here show that
calcium dysregulation induces cancer cell proliferation,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

migration and invasion through activation of ADAM10,
which is a novel and innovative finding in pancreatic
cancer (Figure 8L, schematic). Treatment with fendiline
prevents ADAM10 activation, and cadherin-catenin
signaling and TCF/LEF-dependent gene expression as
well as protein sorting and recycling. Although the various
calcium channel blockers showed differential efficacy,
establishment of fendiline as an effective agent, might
open new avenues to combat PDACs, either alone, or in
combination with other therapeutic agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, reagents and transfections
The cells lines (MiaPaCa2 and Panc1) and the
culturing conditions were described previously [19].
Fendiline.HCl and Nifedipine were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA), Diltiazem.
HCl, Isradipine, SKF96365.HCl and Gemcitabine.HCl
(Gemzar) were purchased from Tocris (Minneapolis,
MN). Control non-targeted siRNAs and ADAM10-specific
siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX) and transfected into MiaPaCa2 cells as per
our published protocol [19].

Western blotting and antibodies
The antibody details (company, catalog number,
species, and dilution) are provided in Table 1. Cells were
treated with the drugs at the indicated concentrations,
washed with PBS, followed by lysis in 1X RIPA buffer
(150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS and 100mM Tris, pH 8.0) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 1mM sodium
fluoride, 1mM sodium orthovanadate and 1mM PMSF.
In the case of PDAC tissue samples homogenization was
carried out using an electric homogenizer in RIPA lysis
buffer. Protein estimation was performed against a BSA
standard using the Pierce 660 reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). 20µg protein was loaded on a
12% SDS-PAGE gel and western blot analysis was carried
out as described previously [19].

Cell toxicity assay
Thiazoyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) was used for the cytotoxicity assay,
following our established protocols [19]. Briefly, 3000
Panc1 or MiaPaCa2 cells in 100µl complete medium
were plated per well in a 96 well plate for 24h and treated
with various calcium channel blockers at concentrations
ranging from 1M to 100µM for an additional 24h. Where
35943

indicated, gemcitabine was used at a concentration of
100ng/ml. At the end of the incubation MTT was added to
the wells at a final concentration of 1mg/ml and incubated
for 2h and the purple formazan crystals formed were
solubilized in 100µl of isopropanol containing 4mM HCl
and 0.1% NP-40 and OD was measured at 540nm.

Cells were plated in 8-chamber slides and treated
with the indicated concentrations of drugs for 24h followed
by labeling with BrdU for 1h at 37ºC and analyzed using
the BrdU labeling kit from Roche (Indianapolis, IN),
following the manufacturer’s protocol. BrdU stained
slides were mounted using Fluro-Gel and analyzed using
Zeiss AxioImager for brightfield microscopy. Proliferation
in response to treatment was measured as percent BrdU
positive cells from the total number of observed cells in
the chamber.

Immunocytochemistry
Panc1 cells were plated in 8-chamber slides and
treated with fendiline for 24h and staining was carried
out following the established protocols [70]. Secondary
antibodies used included anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 or
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488. For staining of actin we
used Alexa Fluor 488-labeled phalloidin (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Slides were mounted using Fuoro-Gel
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Zeiss Axioimager (Carl Zeiss
Microimaging GmbH, Gottingen, Germany) was used to
observe the slides and analysis was done using Axiovision
Rel 4.8 software.

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry
Propidium Iodide (PI) staining followed by Flow
cytometry was used to analyze the effect of drugs on cell
cycle progression, using our previously published protocol
[55]. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and grown for 24hr
and treated with the indicated doses of fendiline for an
additional 24h, trypsinized and washed twice with PBS
and fixed with 70% ethanol. Cells were stored at -20ºC
for at least 24h, washed twice with PBS and resuspended
in 1ml of 1X PBS containing 0.1% triton X-100, 40µg/
ml RNase and 20µg/ml propidium iodide followed by
30min incubation at room temperature. PI stained cells
were analyzed on BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and cell cycle analysis was
performed using the Modfit LT program.

Analysis of endosomal recycling using FM
lipophilic dye
FM 1-43FX was purchased from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA) and staining was performed following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells plated onto
poly-lysine coated 8 chamber slides were treated with
5µg/ml FM 1-43FX dye diluted with medium for 5min.,
and washed and replenished with culture medium with
or without fendiline for 6h. At the end of the incubation
the cells were washed, fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde
for 10min., washed with PBS and mounted using FluoroGel prior to analysis with a Zeiss Axioimager using
AxioVision Rel 4.8 software.

Migration assay
Migration assay was performed following the
established protocol [71, 72]. Briefly, Panc1 cells were
allowed to grow to confluence in a 12 well dish, serum
starved for 24h and scratch wound was made using a
200µl yellow tip. Cells were replenished with medium
containing DMSO (vehicle control) or fendiline 15µM and
images of the wound area were taken at 30min., 12h and
24h, at a marked region. Percent migration was calculated
based on the cell free area measured at 12h and 24h in
relation to that measured at 30min.

Colony formation assay
To determine the effect of drugs on anchorage
independent growth of cells, soft agar assays were
performed as described previously [19]. Briefly, a 0.6%
sterile agar in growth medium was added to 12-well plate
and allowed to solidify at room temperature for 30min.,
which formed the base layer. For the top layer, growth
medium containing 5 000 cells along with the indicated
drug concentrations were mixed with the 3% agar solution
to obtain a final concentration of 0.3% agar and layered
over the base layer in each well. The wells were re-fed
with drug containing media once a week to prevent drying
and at the end of 2.5 weeks, the colonies were visualized
by staining with MTT at a final concentration of 1mg/ml
for 4h at 37°C.

Boyden chamber assay
Panc1 cells were pre-treated with or without
fendiline at the indicated concentrations for 2h and
10,000 cells were plated on to the Boyden chamber
insert (Thermo Fisher Scientific) placed in the chamber
containing DMEM with 20% serum in the presence or
absence of the drug. Cells were allowed to migrate for 4-6
hours and fixed with paraformaldehyde. Cells from the top
of the chamber inserts were removed using a Q-tip and the
migrated cells were stained using hematoxylin or Hoechst,

The PDAC tissue array was purchased from amsbio
(Cambridge, MA). The slides contained duplicate samples
representing normal tissue, islet cell tumor, and Stage I,
II, III adenocarcinoma with regional or distant metastasis.
Immunohistochemistry was performed following our
established protocols [73]. Briefly, slides were heated at
600C and sequentially passed through Xylene, ethanol

10mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 at 950C for 10min. for
antigen retrieval, and incubated for 20min. in methanol
containing 0.5% H2O2 to quench non-specific peroxidase
activity. Slides were incubated with 10% normal goat
serum in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 to block
non-specific antibody binding and incubated overnight
at 40C with 1:1000 dilution of ADAM10 antibody. Slides
were then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody
for 1h followed by ABC reagent, as described by the
manufacturer’s protocol (Vector laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) and were developed using the DAB kit from Vector
lab. Slides were analyzed and quantified by Dr. Coppola,
at Moffitt Cancer Center. The stain was semiquantitatively
scored based on the intensity as negative (0), weak (1),
moderate (2) and strong (3). In all cases at least 34% of the
tumor was positive for ADAM10.
