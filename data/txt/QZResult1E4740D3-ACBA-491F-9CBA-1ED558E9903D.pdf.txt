BACKGROUND: Low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) of the ovary is a rare tumor that is distinct from its high-grade
counterpart. The objective of this study was to determine whether patient demographic factors and clinical treatment
histories affected survival in a population of women with LGSC. METHODS: A review of patients who had pathologically confirmed LGSC of the ovary diagnosed between 1977 and 2009 was performed. Abstracted data included
medical and social histories, anthropometric measurements, and details about diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.
Statistical analyses included Fisher exact tests, Cox proportional hazards models, and the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The study sample included 194 patients who had a median follow-up of 60.9 months (range, 1-383
months). In multivariate analyses, smoking had a negative association with both overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.92; P ¼ .04) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.002.96; P ¼ .05). The median OS was shorter in current smokers than in former/never smokers (48.0 months vs 79.9
months; P ¼ .002). PFS also was predicted by year of diagnosis >1994 (HR, 1.74; P ¼ .01). Although the difference was
not statistically significant, hormone consolidation appeared to be associated with better OS (HR, 0.15; P ¼ .06) and
better PFS (HR, 0.44; P ¼ .07). A smaller proportion of the patients who received hormone consolidation experienced
disease recurrence compared with the patients who did not receive hormone consolidation (66.7% vs 87.6%; P ¼ .07).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking was associated negatively with survival outcomes in women with LGSC of the ovary,
whereas consolidation treatment with hormone antagonists demonstrated a protective associative trend with
survival. Both lifestyle modification and innovative treatment plans should be considered in this group of patients.

KEYWORDS: low-grade serous carcinoma, smoking, hormone consolidation, survival, ovarian cancer.

In 2004, Malpica et al1 described a new 2-tier system for grading ovarian serous carcinoma as either high-grade or lowgrade based primarily on the degree of nuclear atypia. Since then, both clinical and molecular evidence has accumulated in
support of this distinction. Molecularly, low-grade tumors lack the activated pathways for cellular proliferation and cellcycle progression observed in high-grade lesions.2 Whereas mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are common in
high-grade serous carcinoma, mutations in the proto-oncogenes v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1
(BRAF) and K-ras are encountered more frequently in its low-grade counterpart.3,4 In addition, low-grade serous tumors
more highly express both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR),5 suggesting that hormone-antagonistic
agents may be of use in the treatment of this disease.
Clinically, patients with low-grade disease are diagnosed at a much younger age and have substantially longer overall
survival than patients with high-grade serous carcinoma.6 Low-grade carcinoma also is relatively chemoresistant, not only
to up-front agents but also in the setting of recurrent disease.7,8 In 2006, Gershenson et al6 reported on a cohort of 112
patients with stage II, III, and IV low-grade serous carcinoma from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
and identified clinical factors that affected outcome. Persistent disease after primary chemotherapy was associated with a
>3-fold increase in the risk of death and a 2-fold increase in the risk of progression, independent of disease stage and the

presence of residual disease after primary surgery.6 Those
authors also noted that age >45 years at diagnosis was
associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS).6
To date, little research has been done to investigate
the patient-specific factors that may contribute to survival
outcomes among women with low-grade disease. To our
knowledge, possible associations between survival and
medical comorbidities, social habits, and body mass index
(BMI), for example, have not been studied. Because the
life expectancies in these patients are predictably long,
identifying factors that affect survival may permit the initiation of lifestyle modifications aimed at optimizing outcomes. Considering these factors in relation to treatment
practices is important, because the physician is expected
to address all of these factors in developing a plan of care.
To this end, the objective of the current study was to estimate whether patient demographic and clinical factors
affected both PFS and overall survival (OS) in a historic
cohort of women with low-grade serous carcinoma of the
ovary.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After we received approval from The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board,
281 gynecologic oncology patients who were diagnosed
with low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary between
1977 and 2009 and were treated at MD Anderson Cancer
Center were identified, and their medical records were
reviewed. Patients who were diagnosed with International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade 1
or 2 disease before the description of low-grade serous carcinoma in 2004 had their pathology reports reviewed by a
group of gynecologic pathologists at our institution to
determine whether their tumors met low-grade criteria.
Patients with serous tumors of low malignant potential,
nonserous histology, or nonovarian primary tumors
(including primary peritoneal tumors) were excluded
along with patients who had never undergone debulking
surgery.
Abstracted historic data included age at diagnosis,
race/ethnicity, anthropometric measurements, past medical history, and social history. Age was recorded categorically in 5-year intervals for analysis, resulting in 12
distinct age groups. Patient race was classified as either
white or nonwhite. To account for the potential confounding effect of ascites, BMI was calculated using
height and weight measurements that were obtained
within 8 weeks after primary surgical intervention. Spe-

cific medical comorbidities ascertained included diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, history of myocardial infarction,
history of cerebrovascular accident, and presence of other
pre-existing cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease). Medical comorbidities were
classified categorically as either present or absent. Smoking and alcohol use also were classified as categorical variables, and patients were designated as current users, former
users, or never users.
Treatment information was collected and included
date of diagnosis, surgical procedures performed, disease
stage, and presence of residual disease after debulking (2
cm vs <2 cm). Although, by modern convention, residual
disease >1 cm is associated with poorer overall outcomes,
cytoreductive surgeries were considered ‘‘optimal’’ if there
was <2 cm of residual tumor for more than a decade during the study interval. To maintain consistency, we used
this 2-cm cutoff to determine the presence of residual disease. Hormone receptor status (positive or negative), adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation treatments, the use of
consolidation regimens, recurrences, and dates of last follow-up also were recorded. Patients were classified as either alive or dead at last contact, and mortality was not
disease-specific. The year of diagnosis was included to
account for potential temporal bias associated with changing practice patterns, and patients were classified into 1 of
2 groups segregated by the median year of the study interval (1994). This year was selected because it coincided
with an increased use of taxanes at our institution. Consolidation therapy was defined as receipt of hormone
treatment at the completion of adjuvant therapy for
patients who were without evidence of disease (negative
physical examination and negative radiographic imaging;
or, if such data were not available, then a negative secondlook surgery) at the conclusion of primary therapy. Maintenance therapy was defined as receipt of hormone therapy at the completion of primary chemotherapy for
patients who had stable, persistent disease on physical examination and/or imaging studies but did not demonstrate evidence of disease progression. OS was measured
from the time of diagnosis until the date of death or last
contact. PFS was measured from the time of diagnosis
until clinical recurrence of disease, or disease progression
through a first-line chemotherapeutic agent, or as the time
from diagnosis to last follow-up if the patient did not develop recurrent disease. The date of clinical recurrence/
progression was defined as the day on which new findings
on physical examination were evident, the date

radiographic imaging demonstrated a new or larger lesion,
or the date a new therapy was initiated.
Statistical analyses were performed using the
STATA (version 10.0; Stata Corp. College Station, Tex)
and SPSS (version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) software
packages. Summary statistics were generated to describe
the patient cohort. The student t test was used to compare
groups on continuous variables. Chi-square tests (or the
Fisher exact test when appropriate) were used to analyze
associations between categorical variables. Linear regression analyses were performed to estimate associations
between continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney test
was used for nonparametric comparisons. Univariate and
multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, the logrank test, and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to
assess survival outcomes. To avoid inadvertently eliminating potential confounding factors that affected survival,
stepwise backwards multivariate regression analyses
included covariates with P values  .25 from the univariate models. All tests were 2-sided, and P values < .05 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Two-hundred eighty-one patients with low-grade serous
carcinoma of the ovary were identified during the study
interval. Of these, 194 patients met inclusion criteria.
Patient demographics are presented in Table 1. The mean
age of patients at diagnosis was 44.9 years, and the median
follow-up for the entire study group was 60.9 months
(range, 1-383 months). For patients who were alive at last
contact (n ¼ 76), the median follow-up also was 64.5
months (mean, 78.4 months; range, 2-230 months). The
majority of patients were Caucasian, which was consistent
with the racial demographics at our institution. Anthropometric data were available for 137 patients. Of these,
25 patients (18.2%) had a BMI 30 kg/m2. Twenty percent of patients had at least 1 major medical comorbidity,
and more than half had reported no history of smoking or
alcohol consumption. Surgical management varied by
patient; 164 patients (84.5%) underwent oophorectomy,
and 148 patients (76.3%) underwent hysterectomy.
Thirty women (15.5%) had >2 cm of residual disease at
the conclusion of primary surgery, and 175 women
(91.8%) had stage III or IV disease. When immunostaining was performed, tumors were ER-positive in 44 of 49
women (89.8%) and PR-positive in 25 of 45 women
(55.6%). The majority of patients (191 of 194; 98.5%)
received platinum treatment, and 121 patients (62.4%)

received adjuvant taxane therapy. Thirty-two patients
(16.5%) received additional consolidation treatment after
adjuvant chemotherapy, and 50 patients (25.7%) received
maintenance therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients eventually experienced recurrent or progressive disease after all
primary therapies were completed.
Table 2 summarizes the univariate analysis of factors
that affected OS. Because the effects from former smoking
on outcome were similar to those from not smoking, we
combined these 2 groups and designated smoking status
as ‘‘current smoker yes’’ versus ‘‘current smoker no’’ for
the final analyses. The same approach was used for data
on alcohol consumption. Current smoking (hazard ratio
[HR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-3.34; P
¼ .002), comorbidities (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.04-2.33; P
¼ .03), and a BMI 35 kg/m2 (HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.195.38; P ¼ .02) were associated significantly with a greater
likelihood of dying. Hormone treatment received after
primary chemotherapy also was associated significantly
with OS (P ¼ .017); specifically, hormone consolidation
was associated with a decreased likelihood of dying (HR,
0.13; 95% CI, 0.018-0.94; P ¼ .04).
In the multivariate model for OS, current smoking
(HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.03-2.92; P ¼ .04) retained a significant association with shorter survival. The median OS
was 79.9 months for never/former smokers versus 48.0
months for current smokers (P ¼ .002). A Kaplan-Meier
curve for OS by smoking status is depicted in Figure 1.
Current smokers were diagnosed with disease at a significantly younger age than never/former smokers (mean age,
37.0 years vs 45.1 years; P ¼ .01), whereas a greater proportion of never/former smokers had medical comorbidities (24% vs 4.5%; P ¼ .05). More current smokers were
diagnosed with disease before 1994 (50% vs 28.7%; P ¼
.04), whereas more former/never smokers had received
treatment with a taxane (68.3% vs 45%; P ¼ .04). The
proportions of suboptimal debulking (22% of nonsmokers vs 31% of smokers; P ¼ .60) and recurrence
(85% of nonsmokers vs 91% of smokers; P ¼ .52) did not
differ by smoking status. Hormone treatment after primary chemotherapy also was associated significantly with
survival (log-rank P ¼ .028). Although the difference was
not statistically significant in a multivariate setting, compared with women who did not receive any hormone
treatment after primary chemotherapy, data suggested a
protective effect for hormone consolidation (HR, 0.146;
95% CI, 0.02-1.05; P ¼ .056).
PFS was analyzed using the same group of variables.
Several variables demonstrated statistically significant

maintenance vs consolidation, Fig. 2) In addition, the
proportion of women who experienced disease recurrence
or progression was lower in the hormone consolidation
cohort compared with women who did not receive hormone consolidation (66.7% vs 87.6%; P ¼ .07).
Because of the improvement in PFS observed among
women who received hormone consolidation, this subset
of patients was evaluated further. Only 9 women had data
readily available on length of hormone consolidation
treatment, and the characteristics of these women are
described in Table 4. The median length of hormone consolidation treatment was 16.8 months (range, 4.9-70.8
months). ER/PR staining was positive in the tumors from
Patients 1 and 8, and no other patients had hormone receptor assessment performed. The majority of women
who discontinued hormone consolidation therapy either
developed recurrent disease or decided to discontinue
treatment for unspecified reasons. Compared with
women who had no evidence of disease and did not
receive hormone consolidation, PFS was longer in the
women who received hormone consolidation (30.1

Figure 2. Progression-free survival (PFS) is illustrated by hormone treatment after adjuvant chemotherapy. These are PFS
curves for patients who received hormone consolidation, hormone maintenance, and no hormone treatment at the completion of adjuvant cytotoxic therapy. Patients who received
hormone consolidation (n ¼ 9) had a significantly longer PFS
compared with patients who received hormone maintenance
(n ¼ 15; median PFS, 76.4 months vs 22.9 months; log-rank
pairwise P ¼ .03) and longer PFS compared with patients
who received no hormone treatment (n ¼ 170), although the
difference was not statistically significant (median PFS, 76.4
months vs 18.7 months; log-rank pairwise P ¼ .07).

OS was not reached in the hormone consolidation group,
comparing the median OS between these women and
those who had no evidence of disease but did not receive
hormone consolidation was not possible. However, survival curves suggested that hormone consolidation
afforded an OS advantage (log-rank P ¼ .07).

DISCUSSION
Low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary is a unique tumor that is distinguished from high-grade serous carcinoma by differences in both its associated molecular
changes and its natural clinical course. Since the introduction of the 2-tier system,1 low-grade serous carcinoma has
been characterized distinctly by younger median age at diagnosis and prolonged OS.6 In the current study, we
investigated the adverse effects of smoking and the protective effects of hormone antagonism on survival in a population of patients with this disease.

The association between smoking and survival in
patients with ovarian cancer has been debated, and there
is little consensus regarding its true effects. In a large, prospective, population-based study, it was noted that neither
smoking status at diagnosis nor daily cigarette consumption was associated with survival outcomes in women with
epithelial ovarian cancer.9 However, in that report, there
was no distinction made between tumors of differing
grades or histologies. Other studies have suggested that
current cigarette use at the time of ovarian cancer diagnosis increases the risk of death by as much as 65%.10,11
Although those investigations adjusted for such variables
as tumor histology, stage, chemotherapy, and grade, the
grading systems did not follow the 2-tier system or FIGO
grading criteria, which makes their conclusions difficult
to interpret.
Interpreting the results from the current investigation emphasizes the question of whether or not the effect
of smoking is tumor-related; and, given the associations
between smoking and both PFS and OS, either one may
be true. From a general medical standpoint, smoking has
numerous detrimental effects, including impairment of
fasting glucose and an increased risk for non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction.12,13 In women, smoking has been
associated with a reduction in overall life expectancy up to
7.7 years, and greater proportions of smokers experience
lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.14
Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that continued exposure to cigarettes may be a detriment to systems other
than those affected by the primary malignancy.
However, it has been demonstrated that smoking exposure significantly affects the biology of cancer cells.
Dasgupta et al15 reported that, after exposure to nicotine,
breast and lung cancer cell lines demonstrated a downregulation of E-cadherin and b-catenin with a concomitant up-regulation of vimentin, suggesting that nicotine
promotes phenotypic changes consistent with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Nicotine specifically has
been associated strongly with increased angiogenesis as
well, namely, by stimulating increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).16,17 It also has
been demonstrated that the human VEGF gene has an
estrogen-responsive element18 and that, in malignancies
of the human reproductive tract, VEGF messenger RNA
expression is regulated by estrogen.19 In tumors like lowgrade serous carcinoma, the majority of which demonstrate hormone sensitivity, it is possible that the stimulatory effects of estrogen and nicotine may be additive with
respect to tumor growth and angiogenesis. If this

3747

hypothesis holds true, then both antiangiogenic therapy
and hormone antagonists may prove to be effective therapies in this setting.
Treatment with hormone consolidation afforded an
extension in PFS for our cohort of patients. The increased
disease-free interval observed among women who received
hormone consolidation is important, especially because
patients with low-grade serous carcinoma are relatively
young. Consolidation with agents that have comparatively
fewer side effects than cytotoxic therapy may afford
patients an interval of time with a high quality of life during which they can continue to work and maintain their
functional and social well being.
Because of the rarity of low-grade serous carcinoma,
few studies have investigated the success of hormones in
the overall treatment algorithm. In 1989, Kavanagh et
al20 reported a prospective trial of 18 patients with refractory or persistent epithelial ovarian cancer who received
subcutaneous leuprolide therapy. Six of those patients had
FIGO grade 1 disease. Although the study was performed
before implementation of the current 2-tier system, lowgrade and FIGO grade 1 histologies probably are comparable. Of the 6 patients, 3 had partial responses, and 2 had
stabilization of disease.20 In contrast, only 1 response was
observed among patients who had high-grade lesions. The
treatment was well tolerated, and only mild side effects
(pedal edema, hot flashes, mild nausea) were noted in
<33% of patients.
It is important to consider why the patients who
received consolidation were selected for such therapy,
because this may be an inherent selection bias that affected
the outcomes between groups. To date, there are no official recommendations for the use of consolidation treatments in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. In
fact, randomized phase 3 studies have failed to document
any significant change in OS when cytotoxic consolidation
is administered,21 and in only 1 study did prolonged treatment with paclitaxel produce an improvement in PFS.22
In none of these studies was a subset analysis performed to
evaluate survival by tumor grade. With no grade-specific
criteria to triage patients for consolidation or no further
treatment after adjuvant chemotherapy, it is up to the individual physician to determine whether the patient should
proceed with consolidation. However, if the assumption is
made that patients deemed to have the best overall prognosis are those who do not receive consolidation, then our
finding that patients who received hormone consolidation
had longer PFS than those who did not receive consolidation suggests that, regardless of the treating physician’s bias

3748

about anticipated patient outcome, consolidation with a
hormone antagonist may be beneficial.
There are expected limitations to our conclusions
because this was a retrospective study. The long study
interval, incomplete patient information, various treatments for both primary and recurrent disease, the inability
to definitively assess cause of death, and misclassification
bias all are factors that may confound interpretation of
these data. In addition, the assumption that smoking at
the time of diagnosis correlates with continued smoking
throughout the disease course and the inability to quantify
smoking exposure makes definitive associations difficult.
However, because of the rarity of low-grade serous ovarian
carcinoma, hypothesis-generating data like these are important to delineate areas for future study. The potential
for collaborative prospective trials based on retrospective
data continues to grow as more oncologists recognize the
unique nature of this disease.
Low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary is a unique
tumor that should be considered independent for the purposes of patient counseling and management. Here, we
demonstrated 2 significant findings: Smoking has a negative impact on both OS and PFS, and consolidation therapy with hormone antagonists may prolong the diseasefree interval after adjuvant chemotherapy. These data
present the gynecologic oncologist with opportunities
both to consider the molecular aberrations induced by
smoking and to design patient interventions aimed at
reducing the risk of negative health effects associated with
tobacco use. In addition, the data highlight the potential
benefit of modifying current practice algorithms for lowgrade serous carcinoma to more regularly use noncytotoxic, antihormone medications. Ultimately, a multifaceted approach in women with low-grade serous ovarian
carcinoma that addresses both modifiable factors and
alternatives to cytotoxic therapies should continue to be
studied to maximally optimize patient outcomes.
