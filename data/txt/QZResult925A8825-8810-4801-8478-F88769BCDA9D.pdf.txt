Abstract
Basal levels of endogenously generated oxidative DNA
modifications such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) are
present in apparently all mammalian cells, but their relevance
for the generation of spontaneous cancers remains to be
established. Both the 8-oxoG levels and the resulting spontaneous mutations are increased in the livers of Csbm/m/Ogg1 /
mice, which are deficient in the repair of 8-oxoG. In order
to determine the consequences of these additional oxidative
DNA modifications and mutations and thus assess the tumor
initiating potency of this type of endogenous DNA damage,
we treated Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice and repair-proficient controls with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 (0.025%
ad libitum), a potent inducer of liver cell proliferation. The
treatment did not generate any additional oxidative DNA
damage; the elevated levels of 8-oxoG in the Csbm/m/Ogg1 /
mice even decreased. Also, the spontaneous mutation frequencies observed in the lacI gene of BigBlue Csbm/m/Ogg1 /
mice, which were f3-fold higher than in the repair-proficient
mice, declined by 39% under the treatment, whereas the
frequencies in the livers of the repair-proficient animals
remained unchanged. Preneoplastic lesions (staining positive
or negative for glucose-6-phoshatase) developed in the livers
of both wild-type and Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice after 30 weeks.
Both the numbers and the total volumes of the lesions were
f6-fold higher in the repair-deficient mice than in the wildtype mice. The results indicate that spontaneous mutations
generated from endogenous oxidative DNA base damage
efficiently translate into increased tumorigenesis when cell
proliferation is stimulated. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5156–61]

Introduction
There is good evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generated during normal cellular oxygen metabolism are an
important source of endogenous DNA damage and that the
resulting oxidative DNA modifications contribute to the spontaneous mutation rates. Therefore, oxidative DNA modifications have
been suspected to contribute to the aging process, several agerelated degenerative diseases, and the formation of cancer (1, 2).
The recent generation of mice that are defective in the repair of
oxidative DNA modifications has provided a promising strategy to

determine the potency of endogenously generated oxidative base
DNA modifications to act as initiators of carcinogenesis (3). Thus,
Ogg1 / mice, which are defective in the repair glycosylase OGG1
that removes oxidative purine modifications such as 7,8-dihydro8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) from the genome, accumulate higher levels
of 8-oxoG in the liver than wild-type mice (4–6). These result in
elevated spontaneous mutation frequencies, mostly G:C to T:A
transversions characteristic for 8-oxoG (4, 5). The accumulation of
the oxidative purine modifications and of the resulting mutations
are even more pronounced in Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice,3 which
additionally lack a back-up repair mechanism for this type of
damage mediated by Cockayne syndrome B protein (8, 9). The CSB
deficiency alone has no significant effect on the basal levels of
oxidative base modifications and on the spontaneous mutation
rates (8–10).
In spite of the elevated oxidative damage in Ogg1 / and
Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice, no increased incidence of liver tumors was
observed; multiple tumor formation in various organs occurred
only when the defective removal of 8-oxoG was combined with a
defect in MYH, a mismatch repair protein that removes adenine
when mispaired with 8-oxoG (11). This could mean that the
observed levels of oxidative DNA base damage and the resulting
point mutations have a low inherent tumor-initiating potential.
Alternatively, the low level of cell proliferation in uncompromised
livers could be the decisive factor that prevents tumor formation
in repair-deficient animals.
In order to test this assumption and to assess the initiating
potential of a defined level of endogenously generated oxidative
DNA base damage and the associated mutation frequencies, we
treated wild-type and repair-deficient Csbm/m/Ogg1 / animals
with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643. In rats and mice,
peroxisome proliferators are strong inducers of liver cell proliferation and inhibitors of apoptosis. Chronic administration results in
liver hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and tumor formation (12, 13). In
two-stage initiation/promotion experiments, WY-14,643 acts as a
potent tumor-promoting agent in rodent liver (14, 15). There are
some indications that ROS generation is involved in these effects,
in particular because the peroxisomal acyl-CoA-oxidase (ACOX1),
an enzyme strongly induced by peroxisome proliferators, is known
to produce ROS as by-products (16–19). Although no direct
mutagenic effects of WY-14,643 were observed (20), ROS have
been hypothesized to generate oxidative DNA damage and thus
contribute to carcinogenesis (16–18, 21).

The defect in the Csb gene of the mice used in this study is indicated as Csbm/m
rather than Csb / because Csb is severely truncated, but not completely missing (7).

Tumor Initiation by Endogenous Oxidative DNA Damage

Mechanistically, most or all of the biochemical and carcinogenic
effects of the peroxisome proliferators have been attributed to a
direct activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptora (PPARa), a ligand-activated transcription factor (22). Thus,
PPARa / mice are resistant to WY-14,643–mediated cell proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis (23).
The results described in this report indicate that the peroxisome
proliferator WY-14,643 does not generate oxidative DNA modifications, but promotes the hepatocarcinogenesis of spontaneously
initiated cells. Under exposure to WY-14,643, the elevated spontaneous mutation frequency in the livers caused by a relatively low
level of additional endogenously generated oxidative DNA base
modifications (8-oxoG residues) gives rise to a several-fold higher
yield of preneoplastic (enzyme-altered) lesions. This correlation of
oxidative DNA damage levels, spontaneous mutations, and early
markers of tumorigenesis supports the notion that endogenously
generated ROS are quite potent initiators of carcinogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Treatment of mice. C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice were purchased from
Charles River. Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice were bred from Ogg1 / mice (4)
and Csbm/m mice (7) as described previously (9). The generation of Csbm/m/
Ogg1 / mice carrying the bacterial lacI gene (BigBlue mice) and of repairproficient comparisons, which were used for mutation analyses, has also
been described (8). The mice were housed up to five per cage under a 12 h
light and 12 h dark cycle. Water and a special laboratory chow (Altromin),
containing 0.025% WY-14,643 [4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthioacetic acid] if indicated, were given ad libitum up to 250 days. For shortterm treatments (1 or 4 days) WY-14,643 (100 mg/kg of body weight) was
administered in an olive oil vehicle by gavage.
Quantification of ACOX1 expression. The expression of the peroxisomal enzyme ACOX1 in Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice was monitored using a
noncompetitive reverse transcription-PCR as described by Ringhoffer et al.
(24). RNA was isolated from untreated (control) and WY-14,643–treated
livers using a RNeasy Mini-Kit (Qiagen). Primers used for the amplification
of the Acox1 gene with Taq polymerase (Peqlab) were 5¶-TGC CGA GCC
AGC GTA TCC and 5¶-CAC AGC GTT GGG GCG AGT CA. An amplification
of the GAPDH gene (primers, 5¶-CGT CTT CAC CAC CAT GGA GA and 5¶CGG CCA TCA CGC CAC AGT TT) was carried out for the calibration of
the amounts of cDNA. The PCR products were separated in an agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide, and the color intensity of the products was
quantified.
Isolation of hepatocytes. For determination of oxidative DNA
modifications, hepatocytes were isolated from untreated and WY-14,643–
treated wild-type and Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice by a modified two-step
collagenase perfusion technique as described previously (25). Briefly, the
liver was perfused in situ via the vena portae for 15 min with an EGTAcontaining buffer at 37jC. The perfusion was continued with a collagenase
buffer for up to 30 min. After perfusion, the liver was removed, the
hepatocytes carefully dissociated in a suspension buffer and the suspension
filtered through gauze (100 Am pore size). Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation (10 min at 15  g ) and resuspended in fresh suspension
buffer twice (25). The viability of the hepatocytes was determined by trypan
blue (4 g/L) exclusion and ranged from f60% to 70%, independent of the
genotype and treatment with WY-14,643.
Quantification of oxidative DNA modifications. Oxidative DNA
modifications were determined by an alkaline elution protocol (26) with
modifications (27, 28). The number of hepatocytes to each filter was
5  105, corresponding to f10 Ag of DNA. The sum of modifications
sensitive to Fpg protein and single-strand breaks was determined following
incubation of the cellular DNA for 60 min at 37jC with 1 Ag/mL of Fpg
protein immediately after cell lysis. Under these conditions, the incision by
the enzyme at sensitive DNA modifications was shown to be completed
(28). The number of modifications incised by the Fpg protein was obtained

www.aacrjournals.org

by subtraction of the number of single-strand breaks observed in parallel
incubations without enzyme.
Quantification of mutations in the lacI gene of transgenic BigBlue
mice. The assay was done with slight modifications according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (29, 30) as described previously (8). Two
Csbm/m/Ogg1 / animals and two repair-competent controls carrying the
Escherichia coli lacI gene as a target for mutagenesis (31) were treated at
the age of 5 months with WY-14,643 as described above. Livers were quickfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70jC. High molecular weight
DNA was isolated from the livers with a RecoverEase DNA Isolation Kit
(Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The lacI gene was
then rescued from DNA via in vitro packaging into bacteriophages of whom
up to 30,000 (29) were plated overnight with E. coli in the presence of X-gal
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl h-D-galactopyranoside). Color control mutants
(CM0, CM1, CM2, and CM3) with different color intensities were plated in
parallel as an internal control. Per animal, f300,000 plaque-forming units
were plated and mutation frequencies were calculated by dividing the
number of mutants by the number of totally screened plaque-forming units.
Enzyme histochemistry and stereological evaluation. Frozen sections
were taken from each liver and stained enzyme-histochemically for glucose6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) activity (32). G-6-Pase–altered lesions were
quantified by means of a computer-assisted digitizer system (33). The
volume fraction of enzyme-altered tissue in liver and the number of lesions
per unit of liver were calculated using standard stereological techniques.
Statistical analyses. Volume fractions and the number of preneoplastic
lesions were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for non-Gaussian
distributions. Mutation frequencies were compared assuming a binomial
distribution of mutations. Statistical significance was calculated using
Fisher exact test.

Results
WY-14,643 induces liver growth in wild-type and Csbm/m/
Ogg1 / mice. Wild-type and Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice aged 5 months
at the time of examination were treated with the peroxisome
proliferator WY-14,643. For acute treatments (1 or 4 days) the
compound was administered by gavage (100 mg/kg body weight
per day). For longer treatments, the dose of 0.025% WY-14,643 in
the diet (ad libitum) was chosen, which was tolerated for up to
35 weeks in earlier studies (34). In accordance with those findings,
the treatment of wild-type and Csbm/m/Ogg1 / animals up to
250 days did not show a general retardation in weight gain
compared with untreated animals (Fig. 1).
The potency of WY-14,643 to induce liver growth was measured
as a ratio between liver and body weight. The increase in liver
weight started directly after the administration of the drug and
reached a plateau at an f3-fold increased liver-to-body weight
after 14 days (Fig. 2A). The two genotypes responded quantitatively
very similarly. The determination of the mRNA levels of the
peroxisomal ACOX1 using a noncompetitive reverse transcriptionPCR revealed a strong increase of the expression of the gene after
1 day of treatment (Fig. 2B). The 7-fold induction observed in
the Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice is similar to the induction factors
previously reported for wild-type mice under the same feeding
conditions (35).
The serum variables observed after 250 days of treatment with
WY-14,643 and in untreated control mice are summarized in
Table 1. The basal levels in the untreated wild-type and Csbm/m/
Ogg1 / mice were similar, and very similar responses to the
chronic WY-14,643 exposure were observed in wild-type and
Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice. The serum concentrations of liver enzymes
(alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline
phosphatase, and glutamate lactate dehydrogenase) were strongly
increased, whereas concentrations of bilirubin and serum protein

were unchanged. The influence of the peroxisome proliferator on
the lipid metabolism is reflected by a moderate increase of total
serum cholesterol and a decrease of triglycerides.
WY-14,643 does not generate oxidative DNA damage. We
quantified the levels of oxidative purine modifications (8-oxoG) in
the DNA of primary hepatocytes isolated by liver perfusion from
treated and untreated animals with a modified alkaline elution
technique in combination with the bacterial Fpg protein as a
probe. The latter enzyme is the functional bacterial analogue of the
mammalian OGG1 protein and recognizes 8-oxoG and some other
oxidized purine bases, e.g., formamidopyrimidines, in DNA (36).
According to present knowledge, all modifications recognized by
OGG1 (and therefore accumulating in consequence of an Ogg1
deficiency) are also substrates of Fpg.
The levels of oxidative DNA modifications sensitive to Fpg in
untreated and WY-14,643–treated mice are shown in Fig. 3A. In
accordance with previous observations (9), the steady-state levels
of oxidative DNA modifications in the livers of untreated Csbm/m/
Ogg1 / mice were 2-fold higher than in those from wild-type
animals. During treatment with WY-14,643, no changes in the levels
of oxidative DNA modifications were observed in wild-type
animals. In the repair-deficient Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice, a timedependent decrease of the steady-state levels of oxidative DNA
modifications was detected. The decrease may reflect a dilution of
the accumulated oxidative base damage by cell proliferation,
assuming that newly synthesized DNA contains only few oxidized
purine residues, due to the action of the murine MTH1 protein that
hydrolyses oxidized 8-oxo-dGTP into 8-oxo-dGMP in the nucleotide
pool. No such dilution effect is observed in the repair-proficient
wild-type cells, probably because the repair rate in these cells is
much higher than the proliferation rate, so that the reduction of
the damage level by dilution has little influence (9).

WY-14,643 does not increase the mutation frequency in vivo.
To analyze the influence of the peroxisome proliferator on the
mutation frequencies in the livers, Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice and
repair-proficient (heterozygous) controls carrying the bacterial lacI
gene (BigBlue mice) were treated for 3 weeks with the peroxisome
proliferator WY-14,643, and f300,000 plaque-forming units from
multiple sample preparations were analyzed for mutations.
As shown in Fig. 3B, the mutation frequency in the livers of
untreated Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice was 3-fold higher than in the
repair-proficient controls (P < 0.005; ref. 8). Although no significant
change of the mutation frequency was observed after 3 weeks of
WY-14,643 treatment in the wild-type mice, the mutation frequency
in the livers of Csbm/m/Ogg1 / was reduced by f39%. The
decrease is statistically of only moderate significance (P = 0.074).
Because mutations cannot disappear, a decrease would indicate
that the induced cell proliferation predominantly affects a
subgroup of hepatocytes (e.g., hepatocellular stem cells) with lower
than average levels of accumulated mutations.
WY-14,643 induces preneoplastic lesions in Csbm/m/Ogg1 /
mice more efficiently than in wild-type mice. As an early and
sensitive indicator for tumor formation, preneoplastic lesions ( foci
of cells staining positive or negative for G-6-Pase) were quantified
in liver cross-sections at various time points after starting the
treatment with WY-14,643 (37). The fraction of liver tissue occupied
by G-6-Pase–deficient lesions was determined. In addition, the
number of lesions per cubic centimeter of liver tissue was
calculated by standard stereology from data on the size
distribution of two-dimensional transections through G-6-Pase–
deficient lesions (33). Although the livers of both wild-type and
Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice were virtually free of enzyme-altered foci
until day 176 of treatment, lesions staining either positive or

gavage (100 mg/kg body weight) or administered for longer time periods with
the laboratory chow (0.025%) ad libitum . At necroscopy, the body and liver
weights of the animals were determined and the liver weight relative to the body
weight (%) was calculated. B, influence of WY-14,643 treatment on gene

determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. For determination of
the induction factor (relative increase compared with untreated control animals;
right ), the ACOX1 mRNA levels were normalized for equal expression of
GAPDH.

The total volume fraction occupied by the foci (Fig. 5B) was also
higher in the repair-deficient mice, although the difference was less
significant (P = 0.04 at day 211 and P = 0.186 at day 250 according

very large basophilic tumor was detected in one of the wild-type

because of its different biology.

First, the results contribute to our mechanistic understanding of
tumor formation by peroxisome proliferators. In spite of a strong
induction of the peroxisomal ACOX1 (Fig. 2B), an established
source of hydrogen peroxide, treatment with WY-14,643 neither
generated oxidative DNA damage nor mutations (Fig. 3), which
would be detectable in Csbm/m/Ogg1 / mice with high sensitivity.
ROS, either generated by ACOX1 in the peroxisomes or by other
mechanisms such as by stimulation of neighboring Kupffer cells
(38), apparently do not reach the nuclear DNA. Tumors occurring
during peroxisome proliferator treatment, therefore, most probably
result from promotional (epigenetic) effects on spontaneously
initiated cells. Whether ROS play a role for these epigenetic effects
remains to be established.
The absence of oxidative DNA damage generated by WY-14,643
in mice also means that the reported absence of ACOX1 induction
in humans treated with peroxisome proliferators ( fibrates) for
hyperlipidemia (39) does not automatically exclude an associated
tumor risk. The induction of hyperplasia, which is mechanistically
poorly understood, seems to be more relevant for carcinogenesis
under the influence of peroxisome proliferators. Although both the
therapeutic effects and the stimulation of cell proliferation seem to
be mediated by the activation of the PPARa-receptor in the liver,
there are indications that the latter effect is less pronounced in
humans than in rodents (40).
Second, the results allow a correlation between elevated levels
of endogenously generated oxidative DNA base modification,
increased spontaneous mutation frequencies, and the initiation
of carcinogenesis. Thus, <0.4 additional oxidative purine modifications per million base pairs in the livers of mice (Fig. 3A) are
associated with a 3-fold increased spontaneous mutation frequency
in the (nontranscribed) lacI gene (Fig. 3B) and translate into a
6-fold higher number of preneoplastic foci after treatment with a
tumor promoter (Fig. 5). Thus, the tumor-initiating potency of the

additionally accumulated oxidative mutations (mostly GC to TA
transversions) seems to be as high as that of the mostly other types
of spontaneous mutations, which are responsible for the preneoplastic lesions in the repair-proficient animals.
It seems unlikely that the recently shown effects of CSB on gene
expression observed after UV-C irradiation (41) play a significant
role for the tumor promotion by the peroxisome proliferator
because the liver weight gain indicates a very similar response of
Csbm/m/Ogg1 / and wild-type mice (Fig. 2A).
According to the current knowledge of the substrate specificity
of the repair glycosylase OGG1, the accumulating endogenous
DNA modifications could be 8-oxoG and Fapy-G, although the
recognition of other (unknown) types of oxidative purine modifications by OGG1 cannot be completely excluded. The spontaneous
mutation spectrum observed in the Ogg1 / and Csbm/m/Ogg1 /
mice (4, 5, 8) suggests that only 8-oxoG is relevant as accumulating
premutagenic lesion, other substrates of OGG1 are either not
generated or lack a mutagenic potential or are rapidly repaired by
back-up mechanisms. The level of additional oxidative purine
modifications that is actually responsible for the increased
mutation frequency and the elevated levels of preneoplastic foci
is probably even lower than the level of Fpg-sensitive modifications
determined in the analysis because the levels have been shown to
increase with age (6), and most of the mutations might have been
generated early in development when the liver cell proliferation
was still high. Several other factors have to be considered when the
three end points are related to each other. Thus, the measured
increase of oxidative purine modifications is an average for the
whole genome and could be different from that in the lacI gene
and the genes relevant for malignant transformation. Also,
potential sources of errors in the determination of absolute levels

of damage by alkaline elution must be considered, as discussed
previously (28, 42). The factor by which mutation frequencies
increase in response to a given number of additional unrepaired
8-oxoG residues may also differ within the genome. It is also not
clear whether a given number of unrepaired 8-oxoG residues
causes the same number of mutations in wild-type and in Csbm/m/
Ogg1 / mice, as would be required for an extrapolation of the
observed consequences to the basal levels of Fpg-sensitive
modifications observed in wild-type mice.
Despite these limitations, the results indicate a pronounced
tumor-initiating potential of spontaneous mutations that result
from unrepaired endogenous oxidative base modifications, in
particular, 8-oxoG. Our results confirm the classic notion that
additional mutations inevitably result in an increased tumor risk if
promotion (in particular cell proliferation) is sufficient. Further
studies may allow a comparison with other types of endogenous
DNA modifications as well as with exogenously generated
modifications and mutations.
