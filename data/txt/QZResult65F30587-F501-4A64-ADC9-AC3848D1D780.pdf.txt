ABSTRACT
Current challenge in oncology is to establish the concept of personalized medicine
in clinical practice. In this context, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents
clinical, histological and molecular heterogeneity, being one of the most genomically
diverse of all cancers. Recent advances added Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) as a predictive biomarker for patients with advanced NSCLC. In tumors with
activating EGFR mutations, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are indicated as firstline treatment, although restricted to a very small target population. In this context,
cofilin-1 (a cytosolic protein involved with actin dynamics) has been widely studied
as a biomarker of an aggressive phenotype in tumors, and overexpression of cofilin-1
is associated with cisplatin resistance and poor prognosis in NSCLC. Here, we gather
information about the predictive potential of cofilin-1 and reviewed the crosstalk
between cofilin-1/EGFR pathways. We aimed to highlight new perspectives of how
these interactions might affect cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. We propose that cofilin-1
quantification in clinical samples in combination with presence/absence of EGFR
mutation could be used to select patients that would benefit from TKI’s treatment.
This information is of paramount importance and could result in a possibility of guiding
more effective treatments to NSCLC patients.

INTRODUCTION

profile, correlated with clinical factors, would improve
clinical outcomes, as measured by response rate, survival
and safety [4]. Furthermore, to guarantee that patients
can access personalized medicine, a new paradigm has
evolved, the “P4” (standing for predictive, preventive,
personalized and participatory medicine), based on
scientific, organizational and wellness strategies. Thus, to
achieve that, oncology will have to move from a reactive
to a proactive discipline [5].
This approach has good application to
heterogeneous disorders, such as lung cancer whose
development and manifestation vary greatly from
patient to patient. Lung cancer is a disease with clinical,
histological and molecular heterogeneity, remaining one

[1]. Classification into subpopulations differed by their
susceptibility to a particular disease and response to
a specific treatment allows therapeutic intervention to
be focused on patients who will greatly benefit from it,
sparing those who will not [2].
For cancer therapeutics, the use of specific
characteristics of mutational status and deregulated
pathways of tumor itself might help to prevent, diagnose
and treat the disease [3]. The central hypothesis is that

of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide
[6]. The lethality of this disease can be attributed to late
diagnosis (hindering the possibility for surgical treatment),
resistance to chemotherapy treatments and emerging
of complications in advanced stages [7]. Additionally,
traditional lung cancer chemotherapy is not curative
and provides limited benefits, with average survival of
less than one year. Nevertheless, we faced a decade of
significant advances in the identification of key driver
events in lung carcinogenesis and target lung cancer
therapies [8]. The most prevalent type of lung cancer is
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is also described
as one of the most genomically diverse of all cancers [9].
This feature imposes a great challenge for prevention
and treatment strategies, but at the same time provides a
number of opportunities for intervention by ungrouping
NSCLC into a variety of molecularly defined subsets
[4, 6]. In view of such challenges, finding biomarkers
that could overcome these obstacles and group patients
according to optimal responsiveness and efficacy, would
lead to a better treatment and management.
Recent advances added EGFR (Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor) and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma
Kinase) as biomarkers that should be tested for in patients
with advanced lung cancer. For tumors with activating
EGFR mutations (e.g.: L858R and E746-A750del), EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) (such as gefitinib,
erlotinib, and afatinib) are indicated as first-line treatment
[10]. Although this treatment is already in clinical practice,
there is still controversy about its effect on patients overall
survival (OS); in addition, it seems to be very restricted to
a target population composed primarily of non-smoking
women with adenocarcinoma [11].
In this context, cofilin-1 – a small protein of
18 kDa – has been widely studied as a biomarker of a
more aggressive phenotype of different types of cancer
such as breast, gastrointestinal and NSCLC [12-14].
The comprehension of its association with EGFR and
relation with conventional alkylating agent-based therapy
resistance, could help to discriminate and increase the
suitable population to TKI’s treatment. Here, we gather
information about cofilin-1 therapeutic prediction potential
and review the crosstalk between cofilin-1 and EGFR
pathways, highlighting new perspectives of how these
interactions might affect cisplatin resistance in NSCLC.

cellular situations, such as apoptosis induced by oxidants
[16] and intracellular rods formation in neurodegenerative
diseases [17-19].
Over the last 20 years, several studies have pointed
cofilin-1 as an important protein in aggressive cancer cell
behavior, due to its involvement in the coordination of
tumor cell migration and invasion [12, 20-24]. There are
four important mechanisms that regulate the activation
status of cofilin-1: (1) its dephosphorylation at Ser3; (2)
its release from phosphatidylinositol­-4,5­bisphosphate
(PtdIns(4,5)P2); (3) its release from cortactin; and (4)
regulation by oxidation/reduction of one of its four
cysteins residues [16]. Dephosphorylation of cofilin-1
at Ser3 was the first activation mechanism to be well
characterized. Slingshot (SSH) was shown to be a major
phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating cofilin-1
at Ser3, and chronophin (CIN) was recently identified as
a cofilin-1 ­specific phosphatase. In addition, the serinephosphatases PP1 and PP2A can also dephosphorylate
cofilin-1 at Ser3. On the other hand, LIMK1 and
LIMK2 as well as TES kinase 1 (TESK1) and TESK2
phosphorylate cofilin-1 at Ser3 in vivo. LIMK1/2 are the
most well studied kinases and have been proposed to be
the dominant kinase in the regulation of actin dynamics
by mediating cofilin-1 inactivation. Cofilin-1 can still be
inactivated by its interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the
plasma membrane. This follows a general mechanism
whereby membrane lipids have been shown to bind
various actin regulatory proteins. In migrating cells, the
hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 can release cofilin-1 from
its inhibitory interaction with the membrane lipids,
resulting in the local activation of F-­actin filament
severing, protrusion and cell polarity. Finally, the binding
of cofilin-1 to the actin regulatory protein cortactin also
negatively regulates cofilin-1 activity, and this mechanism
seems to be specific to invadopodia formation [12, 25, 26].
Deregulations of such pathways, favoring tumorigenesis,
have been described in some extension for different
types of carcinomas, like breast, oral, ovarian, prostate,
melanoma and gastrointestinal cancer, indicating a strong
prognostic correlation [12, 13, 27-31].
Regarding NSCLC, a series of correlational
studies using meta-analysis of microarray data showed
that mRNA level of CFL1 in NSCLC can discriminate
between good and bad prognosis, in which tumors
with high expression of CFL1 are associated with low
overall survival (OS) [14, 32]. This microarray data
was validated in a retrospective NSCLC cohort by a
semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry method [33].
Meta-analysis of other independent cohorts microarray
data also corroborates that cofilin-1 has a prognostic
capability, indicating that patients with higher levels of
this protein are more likely to be at the poorer outcome
group (Figure 1). In these works, however, the relation of
cofilin-1’s expression with a more aggressive phenotype
of tumors was attributed to its classical activity upon actin

cytoskeleton modulation, related to improved migration
and invasion capacity in cancer cells, as reviewed recently
[26]. Moreover, NSCLC cell lines with high cofilin-1
immunocontent have high invasive potential and were
found to be resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin treatment
(compounds that are gold-standard drugs used in NSCLC
patient management), indicating that cofilin-1 might also
present a predictive aspect to be explored [14].
Hints of a possible role of cofilin-1 in the cellular
resistance against alkylating agents have been described
in cisplatin/carboplatin resistant ovarian cell lines almost
10 years ago [34]. Regarding NSCLC, available data
from pre-clinical studies point to the same direction [14,
35, 36]. Analysis of microarray data in a drug screening
cell panel (NCI60 cell panel) of 118 chemotherapeutic
compounds showed that CFL1 mRNA level is correlated
with resistance against 21 of 30 alkylating agents (such
as cisplatin and carboplatin) tested [14]. High levels of
cofilin-1 were found in cisplatin-resistant A549 NCSLC
cells and A549 cells transiently overexpressing CFL1
plasmid present an increased in GI50 value for cisplatin
[36]. Wei and collaborators also found high levels of
cofilin-1 in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell lines using
proteomics studies [35]. These studies support the idea that
high level of cofilin-1 correlates with cisplatin resistance.
Several mechanisms account for the cisplatinresistant phenotype of tumor cells. Most described are
drug reduced uptake/increased efflux (mediated mainly
by the plasma membrane copper transporter CTR1,

copper-extruding P-type ATPases ATP7A/ATP7B, and
members of the ABC family of transporters MRP and
MDR), increased inactivation (by GSH/γ-GCS/GST and
metallothioneins), and increased repair capacity of DNA
lesions (mediated by members of the nucleotide excision
repair pathway such as ERCC1 or by the machinery
for homologous recombination BRCA1/BRCA2) [37].
Cisplatin cytotoxic is described by its interaction with
nucleophilic sites in N7 position of purines in DNA,
forming DNA-protein interactions, inter and intrastrands crosslinks and DNA adducts [38], which are
the main lesions responsible for cell death [39]. More
than 90% of cisplatin-DNA adducts result in crosslinks
1.2 d (GpG) intra-strands, which modifies the three
dimensional structure of the DNA molecule, enabling
this site for several proteins recognition. These proteins
include damage recognition components of the mismatch
repair (MMR) complex, such as group 1 and 2 proteins
of non-histone high mobility group of proteins (HMG1
and HMG2), proteins related to nucleotide excision repair
(NER), among others [38, 40]. In this scenario, the precise
mechanism that leads to cisplatin resistance is not well
established. Cofilin-1 presents a nuclear localization signal
in its primary structure and can translocate into the nucleus
under specific chemical or physical stimuli (Figure 1) [41,
42]. These information hints the possibility that cofilin-1
could have a nuclear role in supporting the DNA repair
system.
Although these data could potentially impact an

to these events remain to be answered. A sine qua non

signaling network has an interactive nature, being one
of the most deregulated molecular pathways found in
human cancer. The major pathways downstream EGFR
activation are Ras/Raf/MEK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK2/
STAT3 and PLC-gamma/PKC [43-45]. All these pathways
are important for tumor growth, progression and survival.
Besides that, EGFR at different subcellular location
has different functions and overlapping signals [45].
Therefore, various strategies of targeting EGFR or its
family members have been developed and are in different
phases of clinical trials [46]. However, feedback and
crosstalk circuits between signaling pathways could limit
the selection of one driven gene mutation for treatment
with a matching drug. This underlines the difficulty of
using a single marker to predict patient susceptibility to
a particular disease and response to a specific treatment.
Another important factor of tumor aggressiveness is

EGFR: a biological marker in clinical practice
The EGF receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB
family of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) greatly known
for its involvement with pro-tumorigenic pathways
[43]. EGFR, or HER1, is one of a family of epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptors that also includes ErbB2/
HER-2, ErbB3/HER-3, and ErbB4/HER-4. Binding of
its ligands result in conformational change of EGFR,
homodimerization or heterodimerization with other
members of the receptor family, and autophosphorylation

intersections. Different local stimuli may result in cofilin-1 modulation through EGFR activation. Downstream EGFR pathways may
activate cofilin-1 through dephosphorylation by SSH1 and release of cortactin and PIP2 bounds by intracellular pH alteration; also, it may
result in cofilin-1 inactivation by LIMK activity. Cofilin-1 and EGFR may also translocate into nucleus in response to external stimuli,
indicating a possibility of related mechanisms of drug resistance.

the potential cell migration and ability to leave primary
tumor sites. In this aspect, EGF has been shown to be an
important chemotactic molecule both in physiological
and in pathological situations [47]. In fact, in MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells, PI3K and PLC-gamma
pathways indeed promote migration [48]. Thus, research
to identify active pathways downstream EGFR activation

combination therapies striking several critical points

pore complex (NPC) to shuttle EGFR from the outer
nuclear membrane (ONM) to the inner nuclear membrane
(INM) [63, 64]. Once EGFR is inside the nucleus, it may
display four major functions: i) promote gene regulation
(an independent kinase activity of EGFR), acting as a
co-factor and increasing expression of target genes, like
iNOS, COX-2, c-Myc, cyclins and others, contributing
to several malignant phenotypes of human cancers; ii)
phosphorylates proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
promoting its stability and contributing to cell proliferation
and DNA repair (an activity dependent of its kinase
activity); iii) interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase
(DNA-PK) and enhances the DNA repair machinery; iv)
co-localizes with γH2AX complex, enabling chromatin
relaxation for DNA repair process [65, 66]. Therefore,
it is not surprising that a growing body of evidence has
demonstrated a strong association between nuclear EGFR
and resistance to chemotherapy/radiotherapy in tumors.
It has been reported that cisplatin stimuli can induce
EGFR activity and downstream events and this process is
ligand-independent [67]. Regarding cisplatin resistance,
murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts cells treated with cisplatin
had an increasing in nuclear EGFR associated with DNAPKs, which contributed to cisplatin resistance [61]. This
involvement of nuclear EGFR and DNA-PK enhancing
DNA repair and cisplatin resistance was also demonstrated
in human tumor cell lines [68]. Moreover, nuclear EGFR
was correlated with shorter progression-free survival
in early NSCLC stage [69]. This association with poor
prognosis is in accordance with the fact that nuclear EGFR
activity was related to tumor radio and chemoresistance.
However, it is not yet clear how nuclear EGFR affects TKI
and antibodies target therapies.
On the other hand, nuclear translocation of cofilin-1
was first described in 1987 by Nishida and collaborators
in mouse fibroblast cell line C3H-2K stimulationed with
10% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or heat shock at
42-43°C for 60 minutes [70]. Afterward, studies have
shown that cofilin-1 nuclear translocation upon such
stimuli requires dephosphorylation at serine-3 domain to
expose its nuclear localization signal (NLS). Moreover,
cofilin-1 seems to play an important role in cellular stress
contexts by leading monomeric actin (G-actin) inside the
nucleus, since G-actin does not have NLS [41, 71-73].
For example, Sotiropoulos and colleagues showed that
monomeric actin is able to inhibit SRF (serum response
factor)-dependent gene transcription activation inside the
nucleus [74]. However, cofilin-1 appears to have functions
besides actin translocation when inside the nucleus.
Indeed, studies have pointed a direct role of cofilin-1 in
modulation of transcription independently of actin [73,
75]. Additionally, the regulation of cofilin-1 inside the
nucleus may also contribute to phenotype changes, since
nuclear LIMK enhances human breast cancer progression
[76]. Hence, the roles cofilin-1 may play inside the nucleus
are still a prospect for further studies. Likewise, there

Cytosolic and nuclear crosstalks between Cofilin-1
and EGFR pathways
There is an intense crosstalk between EGFR and
cofilin-1 pathways, as summarized in Figure 2. Indeed,
EGFR downstream routes indirectly regulate all of the
described cofilin-1 activation/inactivation mechanisms.
Cofilin-1’s major kinase, LIMK1, is modulated via
EGFR-PI3K route. PI3K activates small Rho GTPases
such as Rac and CDC42, which mediate activation of
p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and Rho-dependent
protein kinase 1 (ROCK1). Afterwards, these kinases
phosphorylate, and activate LIMK [50-53]. On the
other hand, cofilin-1 dephosphorylation by SSH1 may
also be modulated downstream EGFR [54]. As Kligys
and collaborators have demonstrated, SSH1 activation
occurs via Rac1 in keratinocytes [55]. Moreover, it is
well established that EGFR signaling activates Rac1
[56]. Therefore, EGFR pathway can modulate the
phosphorylation (and so the activation) state of cofilin-1.
Another intersection between EGFR and cofilin-1
pathways is via PLC gamma activation followed by
PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, an important mechanism of local
cofilin-1 mobilization [25, 57]. Lastly, tyr phosphorylation
of cortactin by Arg kinase, which is activated downstream
of EGFR, regulates the interaction between the Na+-H+
exchanger 1 (NHE1) and cortactin. NHE1 increases the
intracellular pH, which induces the release of cortactinbound cofilin-1 [58, 59]. Therefore, EGFR pathway plays
a pivotal role over cofilin-1 activity states in response
to different cellular stimuli, leading to several ways to
modulate cell adaptation either in pathological as well as
physiological situations.
Nuclear localization of EGFR was first observed
more than two decades ago in hepatocytes [60]. Only
recently, however, the nuclear translocation of this
protein was shown to be induced by several stimuli,
such as EGF, ionizing radiation and cisplatin treatment
[61]. Activation of EGFR results in its endocytosis and
interaction with importin β1 via its tripartite nuclear
localization sequence [62]. Moreover, EGFR undergoes to
nucleus via a retrograde trafficking from Golgi apparatus
to ER. Once embedded into the ER membrane, EGFR and
importin β1 interface with nucleoporins in the nuclear

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DECLARATION

FUTURE

The authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of
interest to declare.

Considering the information gathered here, it seems
clear that cofilin-1 regulation and functions are closely
related to EGFR activity. However, some evidences allow
the assumption of a greater extent of these interactions.
EGFR functions inside the nucleus have been subject
of intense study, leading to many possible roles of its
translocation upon several stimuli [77]. As presented
in figure 2, cisplatin is one of these stimuli, which may
lead to nuclear EGFR translocation in tumor cells and
resistance to treatment, as result of an enhanced DNA
repair [62]. In this same scenario, we have described
a positive correlation between cofilin-1 expression
and cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cell lines [14, 36].
Considering these facts, could cofilin-1 be affecting EGFR
translocation to the nucleus? Indeed, cofilin-1 signaling
plays a pivotal role in the regulation of efficient EGFR
vesicular trafficking in invasive tumor cell [78, 79].
Since cofilin-1 has a nuclear location signal (NLS)
and may enter into nucleus, as presented in figure 1C,
would its activity be restricted to EGFR vesicular
trafficking? Could nuclear cofilin-1 also play a direct
role in the resistance mechanism to platinum compound?
Dopie and colleagues have shown that actin constantly
shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus and they assign
to cofilin-1 the role of regulating this continuous steadystate actin flow [73]. Based on this, cofilin-1 could be
necessary to maintain a pool of actin inside the nucleus
thus maintaining a “nuclearskeleton” of actin. This
could contribute to the transcriptional action of EGFR
within the nucleus. On the other hand, cofilin-1, as well
as EGFR, can act directly on transcription. According to
Obrdlik and Percipalle, cofilin-1 is a key regulator of pol II
transcription and its interaction with actin would facilitate
the association of transcription machinery with actively
transcribed genes [75].
Therefore, seems that cofilin-1 and EGFR pathways
are closely related in driving the resistance machinery
to cisplatin. Further studies that could evaluate colocalization and activity of cofilin-1 and EGFR in cancer
cells would help to elucidate how exactly they are working
together towards resistance behavior against cisplatin
treatment. Given that increased expression of cofilin-1 is
directly related to cisplatin resistance, we propose that its
quantification could be used in association with presence/
absence of EGFR mutation to guide which patients would
benefit better from TKI’s treatment. Moreover, studies
associating both variables with patient´s outcome could
better elucidate this relationship. This information is of
paramount importance and may, ultimately, result in a
possibility of guiding more effective treatments to NSCLC
