BACKGROUND: The pegylated form of interferon-a-2a (PegIFNa2a) in combination with imatinib has demonstrated a molecular
improvement in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the appropriate dose of
PegIFNa2a has not been established to date. METHODS: In the French SPIRIT trial, the authors compared 2 initial doses of
PegIFNa2a, taking into account an amendment that recommended reducing that dose from 90 lg/week to 45 lg/week because
of toxicities. Accordingly, 2 subgroups of patients were identified: the PegIFN90 group (171 patients who were treated with the
90-lg/week dose) and the PegIFN45 group (50 patients who were treated with the 45-lg/week dose). Both groups were compared
for toxicity and efficacy. RESULTS: PegIFNa2a at a dose of 90 lg/week resulted in a rate of 54% of grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity
compared with 27% with the dose of 45 lg/week (P <.001), leading to discontinuation rates of 40% and 10%, respectively, before 6
months. The dose reduction did not significantly affect the efficacy of the combination. By 12 months, the cumulative molecular
response rates (ie, BCR-ABL/abl  0.01 [IS: molecular responses graded as molecular response 4 (MR4)]) were 14% and 25%, respectively, for the subgroup treated with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and the PegIFN90 subgroup. After the amendment, the MR4 rates
were 10% and 28%, respectively, for the subgroup treated with imatinib at the 400-mg dose and PegIFN45 subgroup (P <.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that in combination with imatinib, the efficient dose of PegIFNa2a

INTRODUCTION
Interferon (IFN)-based regimens were the gold standard in the treatment of patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid
leukemia (CP CML)1 before the introduction of imatinib.2
The phase 3 International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) was a trial comparing imatinib at a
dose of 400 mg daily with interferon-a (IFNa) plus low-dose cytarabine, and demonstrated that imatinib was better tolerated.3,4 In addition, imatinib induced higher complete hematological response and complete cytogenetic response rates
that resulted in longer progression-free survival than IFNa. In addition, a comparison with IFNa-treated historical controls indicated a significant survival advantage with imatinib.5 Thus, imatinib was registered for the first-line therapy for
patients with CP CML.
Despite the advent of a second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that have led to significantly improved
molecular responses and a decreased rate of disease progression,6,7 imatinib may still play a role in the frontline treatment
of patients with CP CML. To improve on the results obtained with imatinib, various groups have explored the combination of imatinib with pegylated forms of IFNa-2a (PegIFNa2a) or INFa-2b (PegIFNa2b).8-10
However, to the best of our knowledge, the appropriate dose of PegIFNa in these strategies has not been clearly
established. The initial planned dose of 90 lg/week of PegIFNa2a in the French SPIRIT trial resulted in a substantial rate

of treatment discontinuation because of toxicity. Thus, to
improve the tolerability of the combination, the initial
dose of PegIFNa was reduced to 45 lg/week. The current
analysis focused on the tolerability and efficacy of the
reduced dose of PegIFNa compared with the initial
planned dose of 90 lg/week.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

The SPIRIT trial is a multicenter, open-label, prospective
trial designed to compare 4 treatment arms: imatinib at a
dose of 400 mg daily versus imatinib at a dose of 600 mg
daily versus imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily plus cytarabine versus imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily plus PegIFNa2a at an initial dose of 90 lg/week. An interim analysis
of the first 634 patients based on a molecular response
(MR) (ie, MR4 5 BCR-ABL/ABL ratio of  0.01)
(a 5 85%; b 5 10%) at 1 year from randomization has
been planned to select the best experimental arm for further comparison with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg. The
rate of MR4 at 12 months was significantly higher with
the combination of imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and
PegIFNa2a (30%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
23%-37%) compared with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg
alone (14%; 95% CI, 9%-21%) (P 5 .001). At 24
months, the corresponding rates of MR4 were 38% (95%
CI, 30%-46%) and 21% (95% CI, 15%-28%), respectively (P 5 .001). Major molecular responses (MMRs)
and undetectable molecular residual disease were also
most frequent with the combination of imatinib and
PegIFNa2a.8 Based on these results and as recommended
by the Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board,
the CML French Group stopped accrual into the treatment arms of imatinib at a dose of 600 mg and imatinib
at a dose of 400 mg plus cytarabine and additional
patients were randomized within the treatment arm of
imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and PegIFNa2a plus cytarabine arms.
Although the combination arm with PegIFNa2a
resulted in significantly higher rate of MRs, a high degree
of hematologic toxicity was also recorded.8 For this reason, an amendment was proposed to reduce the initiating
dose of PegIFNa2a to 45 lg/week. In December 2010,
the closing date of accrual to the SPIRIT trial, 789
patients were included, 221 of whom were assigned to
receive imatinib plus PegIFNa and 223 of whom were
assigned to imatinib at a dose of 400 mg monotherapy.
The endpoints reported herein are rates of MR,
safety, and tolerability. Molecular biology was centralized

and blood samples were collected before the initiation of
the assigned treatment and every 3 months thereafter.
Adverse events were recorded and graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). A MMR was defined
as a decrease in the ratio of BCR-ABL transcripts to ABL
transcripts of < 0.1% (corresponding to a reduction of
3 log units from the standardized baseline level). A MR4
was defined as a decrease in the ratio of BCR-ABL transcripts to ABL transcripts of  0.01% (corresponding to a
reduction of 4 log units from the standardized baseline
level [ie MR4]).11
All patients provided written consent before randomization. The trial was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was
reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the
Poitou-Charentes area (registered at Clinical trial.gov:
NCT00219739).
Patient Characteristics and Treatment

Considering the date of the amendment as August 2009,
2 subsets of patients were identified. Before the amendment, 171 patients received PegIFNa2a at the dose of 90
lg/week (PegIFN90 group) whereas after the amendment, 50 patients were included with a dose of 45 lg
weekly (PegIFN45 group). There was no significant difference in patient distribution noted according to age
(median age of 51 years and 48 years, respectively, for the
PegIFN90 and PegIFN45 groups), sex ratio (1.9 in both
groups), and distribution according to Sokal risk score
(low risk, 38% and 52%, respectively; intermediate risk,
40% and 36%, respectively; and high risk, 22% and 12%,
respectively, for the PegIFN90 and PegIFN45 groups).
During the second part of the protocol, the initial
PegIFNa2a dose was 45 lg administered once a week. After
2 months of treatment with the combination of PegIFNa2a
at a dose of 45 lg plus imatinib at a dose of 400 mg, the
weekly dose of PegIFNa2a could be increased to 90 lg per
weekly injection if the leukocyte count was consistently > 3000/mm2, the neutrophil count was consistently > 1500/mm2, and the platelet count was
consistently > 100,000/mm2, and if nonhematological tolerance permitted it. It was estimated that of the 2 antileukemia
agents, imatinib was likely the most effective. We therefore
attempted to prescribe it continuously during the protocol.
RESULTS
Tolerability and Compliance

The most predominant adverse event was hematologic
toxicity, mainly neutropenia (Table 1). However, grade 3

to 4 neutropenia, which had accounted for 54% of the
toxicities noted with the PegIFN90 treatment, was significantly reduced after the amendment (27% with
PegIFN45; P < .001). The dose reduction was found to
have no significant impact on the other adverse events. It
is interesting to note that the neuropsychiatric syndrome
was overestimated in Table 1 because it encompasses
depression, chronic fatigue, and insomnia. However, the
recognized depression accounts for 2% to 3%. The better
tolerability noted with PegIFN45 allowed for longer
delivery of PegIFNa2a in this subgroup of patients.
Indeed, in this latter subgroup, only 10% of patients permanently discontinued PegIFNa2a before 6 months compared with 40% in the PegIFN90 subgroup. No patients
permanently withdrew from treatment with imatinib during this same period of time because of toxicity.
Treatment Doses and Management of the
Patients

During the first 52 weeks from randomization, the median
weekly doses of PegIFNa2a before and after the amendment were 51 lg and 40 lg, respectively. The median dose
of imatinib was similar before and after the amendment.
The management of the patients did not differ after the
amendment. According to the trial, it was permissible to
increase the dose of PegIFNa2a to a weekly injection of
90 lg for patients assigned to the PegIFN45 group. During
the trial, 4 patients increased their dose for only a short period of time and returned to the 45-lg/week dose because
of hematological and liver toxicities.
Efficacy

Figures 1 and 2{FIGS 1 and 2} show the cumulative incidence of MMR and MR4 rates by 12 months.
The MMR rates at 6 months were 36.3% (95% CI,
29.1%-49.3%) and 36% (95% CI, 22.0%-50.8%),
4286

respectively, before and after the amendment. The corresponding MR4 rates at 6 months were 9.9% (95% CI,
5.9%-15.4%) and 10% (95% CI, 3.3%-21.8%), respectively. Finally for 222 patients, imatinib at a dose of 400
mg alone resulted in fewer responses at 6 months, with an
MMR and MR4 rate of 19.3% (95% CI, 14.3%-25.0%)
and 5.8% (95% CI, 3.1%-0.7%), respectively.
By 12 months, the cumulative MMR rates for
patients receiving imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and those
receiving PegIFN90 were 36% and 54%, respectively
(P < .001 overall). These differences remained highly significant after the amendment, with the response rates
being 38% and 60%, respectively, for the subgroups
receiving imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and PegIFN45
(P < .0001 overall) (Fig. 1).
The cumulative MR4 rates were also found to be significantly higher with the combination arms compared
with the monotherapy arms. By 12 months, the cumulative MR4 rates were 14% and 25%, respectively, for imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and PegIFN90 (P < .0001
overall). After the amendment, the MR4 rates were 10%
and 28%, respectively, for imatinib at 400 mg and
PegIFN45 and remained statistically significantly different (P < .0001 overall) (Fig. 2). When the MMR and
MR4 response rates by 12 months were adjusted on the
Sokal risk score, the results were still significant
(P < .0001 ). It is interesting to note that no statistically
significant difference was observed in the progression-free
survival rate within the 2 subgroups.
DISCUSSION
CML has long been regarded as a leukemia that could be
one of the most accessible to immunotherapy and therefore IFN appears to be a reasonable therapeutic approach
in the context of immunoreactivity. IFN is an immunomodulating agent that has demonstrated activity in CML

for selected groups of patients who achieved durable cytogenetic responses. However, despite these clinical
responses, the use of IFN has been limited because of
unacceptable toxicity. Moreover, the recent success of
TKIs such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib has completely changed the therapeutic strategy for patients with
CML. However, there are clinical and laboratory data
indicating that TKIs given alone are not curable treatment
for patients with CML.12-15 Because of the immunological and cellular effects of IFN and its activity in normal
and leukemic stem cells,16,17 the reintroduction of IFN in
the therapeutic management of patients with CML is currently under study.18-20 Toxicity is one factor among
others than can hamper the efficacy of a drug because it
impairs adherence to the treatment.20,21 The combination
of a 40-kilodalton molecule of polyethylene glycol connected to IFNa2a or 2b allows for the formation of a new
type of IFN with improved properties of absorption and
prolonged effects, which allow the injection to be administered once a week. In a study demonstrating the superiority of PegIFNa2a, it was suggested that the starting dose
of PegIFNa as a single agent should be 180 lg/week.22 In
the French SPIRIT trial, despite the initial dose of PegIFNa2a of 90 lg weekly before the amendment, hematologic toxicity was recorded within the PegIFNa arm (68%
of patients with toxicities of all grades, including 54%
with grade 3-grade 4), leading to a rate of40% of permanent discontinuation of PegIFNa. A relation between the
dose of PegIFNa and toxicity was also established in 2
other studies combining imatinib and PegIFNa2b. In the
phase 2 Italian GIMEMA single-arm study, the intended
doses of PegIFNa2b of 50 lg/week, 100 lg/week, and
150 lg/week in combination with imatinib were too high
and resulted in PegIFNa being discontinued before 12
months in 60% of the 76 patients enrolled.9 The Nordic
trial10 randomized patients to imatinib plus PegIFNa2b
(n 5 56 patients) versus imatinib alone (n 5 56 patients)
after the achievement of a complete hematologic response
with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily. In this study, the
grade 3 to 4 neutropenia prompted an amendment that
recommended reducing the initial planned dose from
50 lg/week to 30 lg/week. According to tolerability, this
latter dose could be increased to 50 lg/week or further
reduced to 15 lg/week. Permanent discontinuation of
PegIFNa2b occurred in 61% of patients before 38 weeks.
The median administered dose of PegIFNa2b was
42 lg/week in 22 patients who did not discontinue the
treatment. This median dose is close to what was observed
in the current study with PegIFNa2a before the amendment
(51 lg/week) and after the amendment (40 lg/week). It is
4288

interesting to note that in the GIMEMA study, the average
dose of PegIFNa2b was 33 lg/week. It was suggested in the
SPIRIT trial8 that the duration of treatment with PegIFNa
could affect the rates of MMR. Among patients who had
been treated for < 4 months with PegIFNa, the rate of
MMR was 48% versus 82% for those who received PegIFNa2a for > 12 months. Likewise, in the Nordic study, the
MMR rates increased significantly with the duration of
PegIFNa2b administration: when administered for < 12
weeks, the MMR rate was 67% versus 91% when the agent
was administered for > 12 weeks.10 In the current study,
the low dose of 45 lg/week allowed for the longer delivery
of PegIFNa2a at the time of the analysis, with 90% of
patients receiving the drug for at least 6 months, eventually
resulting in the same rate of MMR and MR4 compared
with the starting dose of 90 lg/week. Within the limitation
of this small number of patients, the data from the current
study appear to support the use of PegIFNa2a at a dose of
45 lg/week when combined with imatinib.
Conclusions

In the 4 European study groups that have reported on
IFN in combination with imatinib to date, only PegIFNa2a and PegIFNa2b were found to have an additional
impact on the treatment of patients with CML.8-10,19
Based on the data reported herein, we conclude that the
starting dose of PegIFNa2a of 45 lg weekly is more
appropriate when it is combined with imatinib at a dose
of 400 mg/day.
This low dose is two times less toxic, although as
effective compared with the higher starting dose in combination with imatinib. In the long run, it is expected that
the entailed longer delivery will result in a higher rate of
undetectable residual disease.
