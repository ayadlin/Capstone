Intratumoral heterogeneity within individual breast tumors is a well-known phenomenon that may
contribute to drug resistance. This heterogeneity is dependent on several factors, such as types of
oncogenic drivers and tumor precursor cells. The purpose of our study was to engineer a mouse
mammary tumor model with intratumoral heterogeneity by using defined genetic perturbations. To
achieve this, we used mice with knockout (−/−) of Ink4a/Arf, a tumor suppressor locus; these mice
are known to be susceptible to non-mammary tumors such as fibrosarcoma. To induce mammary
tumors, we retrovirally introduced an oncogene, HRAS(G12V), into Ink4a/Arf−/− mammary cells
in vitro, and those cells were inoculated into syngeneic mice mammary fat pads. We observed
100% tumorigenesis. The tumors formed were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor, and HER2. Further, they had pathological features similar to those of human triplenegative breast cancer (e.g. pushing borders, central necrosis). The tumors were found to be
heterogeneous and included two subpopulations: CD49f− quiescent cells and CD49f+ cells.
Contrary to our expectation, CD49f− quiescent cells had high tumor-initiating potential and
CD49f+ cells had relatively low tumor-initiating potential. Gene expression analysis revealed that
CD49f− quiescent cells overexpressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-driving genes,
reminiscent of tumor-initiating cells and claudin-low breast cancer. Our animal model with
intratumoral heterogeneity, derived from defined genetic perturbations, allows us to test novel

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Tumors are heterogeneous in various ways, including their pathology, transcriptional and
immunophenotypic profiles, and genetic makeup. Recent advancement in array technologies
allows us to understand intertumoral heterogeneity (heterogeneity between tumors) through
genome-wide analyses—e.g., oligonucleotide microarray analysis and array complementary
genomic hybridization (CGH) (1, 2).

Author Manuscript

Similar distinctions are seen in intratumoral heterogeneity (heterogeneity within a tumor), a
leading area of interest in cancer research during the last decade (3). One facet through
which to understand intratumoral heterogeneity is cellular heterogeneity, alternatively
referred to as cancer stem cell (CSC) hierarchy (4): the concept that cells have differing
capacities to initiate tumors. Accumulating evidence in the CSC research field shows that
intratumoral heterogeneity is consistent for specific tumor types and can be defined with
tumor type-specific CSC markers (e.g. human breast cancer CSC, CD4+ CD24−/low(5, 6);
human glioblastoma CSC, CD13+ (7)). However, there are also some exceptions to observed
CSC hierarchy. For example, CD133− glioblastoma cells can initiate tumors under certain
conditions (8). Furthermore, in a study of genetically engineered mouse mammary tumor
models, the CSC fractions of each model had distinct cell surface marker profiles (9–11).
Given that in each genetically engineered mouse, mammary tumorigenesis occurs through
genetic perturbation (i.e. trans- or knockout genes), intratumoral heterogeneity is also
assumed to be affected by those perturbations. Clinically, this intratumoral heterogeneity
could result in a lack of tumor response to many novel targeted therapies (6, 12). A mouse
mammary tumor model with intratumoral heterogeneity induced by defined genetic changes
would enable us to understand what is contributing to resistance to certain targeted
therapies. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether intratumoral
heterogeneity could be observed in our mouse mammary tumor model.

Ink4a/Arf is a tumor suppressive locus and transcribes p16Ink4a and p19Arf in response to
physiological stresses such as oncogenic stress and oxidative stress, then consequently
elicits apoptosis or senescence in non-cancer cells (13). Previous studies on genetic
engineering mouse models showed that knockout of Ink4a/Arf didn’t increase an incidence
of mammary tumors (14). Meanwhile, Ink4a/Arf−/− did accelerate tumor relapses in a druginducible mammary tumor model, which had similar pathological features to triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of human breast cancers (15). Therefore, we assumed that
Ink4a/Arf−/− is a suitable genetic background to induce mammary tumors with an additional
oncogene, which allows us to mimic human breast cancer and to observe intratumoral
heterogeneity in those models. In order to achieve this, we first treated Ink4a/Arf−/− mice

mammary cells with oncogenic HRAS(G12V) in vitro (16). We picked this oncogene
because the RAS pathway is activated by transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase activation
in many breast cancers although mutated HRAS is not commonly observed in breast cancer
(17, 18).
The HRAS(G12V)-transformed cells formed tumors in 100% of the mice when injected into
syngeneic mice. These tumors were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor,
and HER2 and similar to human TNBC. Further testing revealed that our new animal model
does observe intratumoral cellular heterogeneity that is defined by the expression level of
integrin α6 (CD49f), a putative marker of human and mouse mammary CSCs (11, 19).

HRAS(G12V) transformed Ink4a/Arf−/− mouse mammary cells formed lethal tumors in vivo

Author Manuscript

As previously reported, we had never seen naturally occurring mammary tumors from
Ink4a/Arf−/− mice (14). Therefore, to induce mammary tumors, we added another oncogenic
event to Ink4a/Arf−/− mouse mammary cells. Applying in vitro retroviral gene transfer
methods, we used Ink4a/Arf−/− mammosphere cells as target cells to be transformed (Fig. 1).
The formation of cell masses called mammospheres is a well-established method for
purifying primitive MECs (19, 20). We confirmed that mammosphere cells were almost all
composed of lineage-negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The lineage-negative cells
fully committed to luminal or basal epithelial cell lineages in a mutually exclusive manner
(Supplementary Fig. S1B) and to a milk-producing cell lineage under prolactin stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Having thus confirmed that mammospheres were composed of
primitive mammary epithelial cells (MECs), we then retrovirally introduced an oncogene
HRAS(G12V) and a mock control into Ink4a/Arf−/− or Ink4a/Arf+/+ mammosphere cells in
vitro. We chose HRAS(G12V) as a candidate oncogenic driver because of the robustness for
transforming epithelial cells into tumors and a potential role in human TNBC.

Author Manuscript

Next, mammosphere-derived cells, either retrovirus-infected or not-infected, were
inoculated into mammary fat pads of syngeneic recipient mice (Fig. 1). Infection ratios were
comparable for each combination, with a range of 10.2–12.2% (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Using this method, tumors developed only from Ink4a/Arf−/− MECs with HRAS(G12V) but
not with mock control, neither from Ink4a/Arf+/+ MECs with HRAS(G12V) (Fig. 2A, B). In
Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V)-driven tumors, overexpression of HRAS was confirmed at
protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S3, S4), and overexpressed HRAS
expectedly had mutation at codon12, synonymized as G12V (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig.
S5). Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V)-driven tumors emerged within a month in all cases and
were fatal. Thus, Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V) constitute a robust genetic combination for
inducing tumors in MECs in vivo.
HRAS(G12V) and Ink4a/Arf−/− induced mammary tumors were pathologically similar to
human triple-negative breast cancer

staining (Fig. 2C), suggesting that they are highly proliferative and comprised of epithelial-

derived mucus-producing cells_ENREF_17. The tumors had pathological characteristics of
human TNBC—pushing borders and central necrosis (Fig. 2C) (21)—and were composed of
spindle-shaped cells. Furthermore, induced tumors locally invaded adjacent organs, such as
the vertebrae, peritoneum, and intestinum, and spontaneously metastasized to the lung and
liver (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

In immunohistochemical analyses, keratin 14 and keratin 18, which are expressed in basal
and luminal MECs (22), were patchy positive (Fig. 2F), suggesting intratumoral
heterogeneity in cell lineages (basal or luminal). Meanwhile, E-cadherin was negative.
Vimentin and SMA, markers of mesenchymal cells, were not expressed in the tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S6) (23, 24). Those three markers’ status is not exactly as seen in
human TNBC (25). However, we could assume that the induced tumors lost epithelial
characteristics but did not fully acquire a mesenchymal phenotype yet in the process of
tumorigenesis.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), a downstream of ras, were highly
phosphorylated; in contrast, EGFR, an upstream of ras, was not expressed at all (Fig. 2F).
Finally, these tumors were negative for ER, PR, and HER2 (Fig. 2E), which allowed us to
determine these tumors as triple negative tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that
Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V) transformed the mouse MECs to triple-negative mammary
tumors, which shared core characteristics of human TNBC.
Comparison of molecular features of induced mouse mammary tumors and human TNBC
by microarray analysis

Author Manuscript

We then analyzed the molecular features of this tumorigenesis along with Ink4a/Arf−/− and
HRAS(G12V). To this end, we used Ink4a/Arf+/+ mammospheres and tumorospheres,
mammospheres from Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V) induced tumors, as phenotypic
representations of non-tumor and tumor. We then compared gene expression between
Ink4a/Arf+/+ mammospheres and tumorospheres (Fig. 3A). We identified 185 overexpressed
genes in the tumorospheres; all of these genes had human orthologues (false discovery rates
≤1.00E-07). We named this gene set “Ink4a/Arf−/− plus HRAS(G12V)-driven genes” and
analyzed it using IPA, Ingenuity’s knowledge-based pathway analysis software (26).
Leading pathways that were involved were biosynthesis of steroids, cell cycle–related (ATM
signaling and G1/S checkpoint regulation), and interferon response–related (activation of
IRF by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors and interferon signaling) (Fig. 3B).

Author Manuscript

Given that induced tumors had some pathological findings similar to those of human TNBC,
we next analyzed the correlation between the Ink4a/Arf−/− plus HRAS(G12V)-driven genes
and human TNBC. We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of human
breast cancer clinical data sets Transbig (27) and Wang (28) using Ink4a/Arf−/− plus
HRAS(G12V)-driven genes (Fig. 3C). Through this clustering, we identified two gene
clusters that were highly correlated (correlation>0.4) with human TNBC samples: cell cycle
genes and interferon response genes (Supplementary Table S1). To confirm that these gene
sets truly reflect the intrinsic aggressiveness of human TNBC, we analyzed their prognostic
significance by using another human breast cancer data set, the Mainz data set (29). Then,
only the cell cycle metagene had a significant prognostic impact; the interferon response

metagene did not (Supplementary Fig. S7). Thus, we can conclude that Ink4a/Arf−/− plus
HRAS(G12V)-driven tumors have at least a common molecular feature with human TNBC,
which can be functionally annotated as proliferation or cell-cycle related.
Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V)-driven tumors had intratumoral heterogeneity: highly
tumorigenic CD49f− quiescent cells and low-tumorigenic CD49f+ cells

Author Manuscript

We next evaluated intratumoral heterogeneity by assessing expression levels of tumorinitiating cell (TIC) markers. We analyzed the expression levels of candidate TIC markers
CD29, CD24, CD49f, and CD44 in induced tumors, and, as a control, in primary MECs (5,
10, 11, 19, 30, 31) (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Fig. S8). Further, we characterized cell surface
markers CD61 and Sca1, markers of mouse mammary progenitor cells (9, 11, 32), in the
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8). In comparison with primary MECs, in the induced tumors
there were fewer CD24+ cells and more CD49f+ and CD44+ cells. In contrast, CD29 was
positive in both primary MECs and tumors. Meanwhile, Sca1 and CD61 were positive in
almost all tumor cells. We then performed a tumor cell inoculation assay in a limiting
dilution manner with regard to each fraction (positive and negative) of each marker. CD29
was excluded because of its small range of expression. Lin+ cell–depleted GFP+
(Lin−GFP+) cells were sorted according to the expression level of each marker (CD44−,
CD44+, CD24−, CD24+, CD49f−, and CD49f+) (Fig. 4A, B, and C), then inoculated into
mammary fat pads of C57BL/6J mice at doses of 2,000, 500, 100, and 20 cells (Table 1).
Unexpectedly, the tumor incidence from CD49f− cells was much higher than that from
CD49f+ cells or the other subpopulations at 100-cell inoculation. The higher tumor
incidence from CD49f− cells was inconsistent with previous reports that TICs can be
enriched among CD49f+ cells (11, 19).

Author Manuscript

To better understand this phenomenon, there are two approaches. The first is to identify
another positive TIC marker, and the second is to further analyze the CD49f− fraction to
clarify the intratumoral heterogeneity in this model. We chose the latter approach and
evaluated the cell cycle status of the CD49f− fraction. The presence of quiescent TICs has
been proposed for some tumors, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (33). We hypothesized
that tumor incidence from CD49f− cells was attributable to quiescent tumor cells. To test
this hypothesis, we further fractionated the CD49f− cell population into CD49f− quiescent
and CD49f− dividing cells (Fig. 4D) by staining with Hoechst 33342 and pyronin Y;
quiescent cells were identified by Hoechst-Redlow and pyronin Ylow staining, and dividing
cells, by Hoechst-Redhigh and pyronin Yhigh staining (33). We inoculated the subfractions
into recipient mice. As expected, CD49f− quiescent cells had higher tumorigenic activity
than did CD49f− dividing cells (Table 1).

Next, to understand this intratumoral heterogeneity at the molecular level, we performed
expression analysis among the two subfractions: highly tumorigenic cells (CD49f−
quiescent) and cells with relatively low tumorigenicity (CD49f+). We sorted these paired
fractions from a sequential series of three tumors. The genome-wide expression was
compared by paired t-test between CD49f− quiescent cells and CD49f+ cells. Then, 106

overexpressed genes (false discovery rate <9.34E-04) and 93 underexpressed genes (false
discovery rate <9.88E-04) in CD49f− quiescent cells were analyzed with IPA pathway
analysis software to understand their biological significance (Fig. 5A, B and Supplementary
Table S2). The key components of overexpressed genes in CD49f− quiescent cells were
collagen family proteins, MMP2, integrin-αVβ3, and ITGB5, which were annotated as the
cellular assembly and organization network in IPA network analysis (Fig. 5C). Interestingly,
CD49f− quiescent cells also overexpressed Thy1.1 (Supplementary Table S2), a marker of
TICs in Wnt transgenic mouse mammary tumors (11). This finding suggests that we might
further purify TICs with Thy1.1. Among underexpressed genes in CD49f− quiescent cells, as
expected, cell cycle–driving genes were significantly downregulated (Fig. 5B).

Author Manuscript

Canonical pathway analysis is another knowledge-based output style of IPA; it elucidates
the bioprocesses of a gene set of interest. Through this analysis, overexpressed genes in
CD49f− quiescent cells were shown to be highly correlated with the bioprocess of hepatic
stellate cell activation (Fig. 5A) (34–36), which is known to make hepatic stellate cells
trans-differentiate to myofibroblast cells and results in liver fibrosis due to accumulation of
collagen. Further, most of the components in this bioprocess are closely related to epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CD49f− quiescent cells overexpressed several kinds of
collagens, a hallmark of EMT. Those collagens and their upstream molecules, such as TGFβ, IGF-1, and endothelin receptor type A, were also overexpressed in CD49f− quiescent cells
(Supplementary Fig. S9) (35).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Through genetic manipulation of mouse mammary cells in vitro and subsequent inoculation
into recipient mice, we successfully induced the mouse TNBC model with a unique
intratumoral heterogeneity, represented by both CD49f− quiescent TICs and CD49f+ nonTICs. We were able to induce mammary tumors from Ink4a/Arf−/− mouse mammary cells
with HRAS(G12V) that have such intratumoral heterogeneity.
Previously reported mouse mammary tumor models produced spindle cell tumors in
reproducible ratios; about 50% of p53-null mouse mammary tumors are spindle cell tumors
although those tumors are molecularly heterogeneous (37, 38). The resultant tumor
phenotype of our Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V) model was similar to the phenotype of the
spindle cell tumor model, recently called “EMT-type tumor” model (23), which also has
triple-negative receptor features. The EMT-type phenotype in our model was relatively
consistent or homogeneous, suggesting that Ink4a/Arf−/− plus HRAS(G12V) strongly dictated
this phenotype.

Author Manuscript

The populations of cells that were most tumorigenic varied in mouse mammary tumor
models with intratumoral heterogeneity. In MMTV-Wnt transgenic mice, luminal
progenitor-like CD61+ tumor cells had relatively higher tumorigenic activity than that of
CD61− tumor cells (9). In contrast, in a p53-null mouse mammary tumor model, mammary
stem cell-like CD29highCD24high tumor cells had the highest tumorigenic activity (10).
Combined with our data, these reports suggest that intratumoral heterogeneity partially
depends on the type of genetic perturbation that drives the tumors.

Our model’s unique intratumoral heterogeneity, whereby CD49f− quiescent cells had much
higher tumorigenicity compared to CD49f+ cells, however, is inconsistent with the findings
from known mouse mammary tumor models. In the previously reported models, CD49f+
cells had relatively higher tumor-initiating potential than did CD49f− cells, a pattern
reminiscent of the profile of normal mammary stem cells (11, 30). The impact of the cell of
origin on this intratumoral heterogeneity in the present model is unknown, however, we may
at least infer that Ink4a/Arf−/− plus HRAS(G12V) is sufficient to perturb stem-cell hierarchy
in the axis of CD49f expression. In fact, this was the case in BRCA1-deficient plus p53+/−
mouse mammary tumor model. In that model, when BRCA1 was enforced to be deleted in
luminal progenitor cells, CD24− cells were revealed as TICs, which is inconsistent to normal
stem cell hierarchy in mouse mammary glands; mouse mammary stem cells are CD24+.
Together with our finding, certain oncogenic factors are supposed to have an impact even
for changing stem cell hierarchy in occurred tumors. Consequently, this notion has been
turned on the reason why we refer CD49f− quiescent cells as TICs but not cancer stem cells,
and rather designate intratumoral heterogeneity than CSC hierarchy.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We molecularly delineated this intratumoral heterogeneity by comparing the gene
expression of CD49f− quiescent TICs and CD49f+ non-TICs. This molecular heterogeneity
was represented by EMT-related genes, a pattern that was annotated as the hepatic fibrosis
bioprocess in IPA analysis. The representative components of EMT-related genes include
TGF-β, IGF-1, and MMP2 (39). Those are also the key components expressed in the
claudin-low subtype in human breast cancers. This subtype was discovered through
unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of human and mouse mammary tumor panels
(40). It expressed lower levels of E-cadherin and tight junction proteins, including claudin 3,
and is thought to be a subtype of TNBC (41). The claudin-low gene signature, which defines
the claudin-low subtype, was enriched in TICs and treatment-resistant residual tumor cells;
these cells are putative molecular targets (12). Interestingly, in our model, TICs shared some
molecular features with those of the human claudin-low subtype, although our TIC cell
surface markers were analogous to neither those of human breast cancer nor those of other
mouse mammary tumor models.
In summary, we induced intratumorally heterogenous, highly proliferative triple-negative
mouse mammary tumors with the genetic combination of Ink4a/Arf−/− and HRAS(G12V).
Although, as with other mouse models, this model still has the technical gap of the cell of
origin being unknown, the recapitulated intratumoral heterogeneity, represented by the
components of the claudin-low gene signature, allows us to identify molecular features of
TICs. Further, our model may offer us the opportunity to develop drugs that can target the
RAS-mediated pathway (e.g. MEK inhibitor, ADZ6244) (42) or TICs.

We dissected mammary glands from 6- to 7-week-old female mice and tumors in recipient
mice. After mincing with scissors, the tissue was digested with collagenase and
hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies) in DMEM/F12 (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal
calf serum (FCS), 5 μg ml−1 insulin, and 20 ng ml−1 epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 3 to
4 hr at 37 °C. After vortexing and lysis of the red blood cells in NH4Cl, we sequentially
digested the resulting organoid suspension with 0.25% trypsin (2 min, 37 °C) and then with
5 mg ml−1 dispase and 0.1 mg ml−1 DNase (Sigma) (2 min). We obtained a single-cell
suspension by filtration through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon). The methods for in vitro
cellular assay are described in the Supplementary Methods.
Retroviral gene transfer

pMX-HRAS(G12V)-IRES-GFP or pMXs-IRES-GFP (mock plasmid) were transfected into
Plat-E retrovirus packaging cells using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche) (45). pMXsIRES-GFP was kindly provided by T. Kitamura. Virus particle–containing supernatants
were centrifuged, and virus pellets were reconstituted with floating culture medium,
DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF) (PeproTech), 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and
100 μg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO). Single suspended cells, derived from collected primary
mammospheres using 40-μm cell strainers, were placed in virus-containing medium and
plated into Ultra-Low Attachment dishes (Corning). To this end, the secondary
mammospheres that contains retrovirus-infected cells were formed.
Antibodies
The following antibodies against mouse antigens were purchased from eBioscience: CD24APC, CD29-APC, CD49f-APC, CD44-APC, Sca1-biotin, CD61-biotin, CD45-biotin,
CD31-biotin, and TER119-biotin. We also obtained antibodies against HRAS (Clone C-20;
Santa Cruz), phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling), milk (Nordic Immunological Laboratories),
keratin 14 (Covance), keratin 18 (Progen Biotechnik), E-cadherin (BD Phamingen), smooth
muscle actin (SMA; Abcam), and vimentin (Sigma). Streptavidin APC and streptavidin
APC-eFluor 780 were purchased from eBioscience. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary

Cell labeling, flow cytometry, and sorting
To analyze the cell-cycle status, cells were first stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 at 37 °C
for 30 min, followed by 1 μg/ml pyronin Y at 37 °C for 30 min. Antibody incubations were
performed at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 μg ml−1 propidium iodide
before analysis. Data analysis was performed on the single, live cell gate using Flowjo

Paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and
subjected to antigen retrieval by boiling in 10 mM citrate buffer for 15 min before blocking.
After blocking, we incubated the sections sequentially with the primary antibodies,
biotinylated secondary antibodies (mouse-specific and rabbit-specific), ready-to-use
Vectastain avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex (ABC)
reagent (Vector Laboratories), and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAKO); finally, we
counterstained with hematoxylin. For mammospheres, we spun mammospheres onto glass
slides with a Cytospin 4 centrifuge (Shandon, Thermo). The cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, then, incubated with 0.2% Triton X100 in PBS for 5 minutes, and
blocked with goat serum for 30 min. Following procedures commencing primary antibody
reaction were performed as previously described (46).
RT-PCR and mutation analysis

We extract whole RNAs from alive sample cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and performed
reverse transcription reactions with SuperScript III and the oligo (dT)20 primer (Invitrogen).
PCR was perfomed with NavaTaq Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen). Sequences of
gene specific primers were as followings: HRAS, 5′GAGACCCTGTAGGAGGACC and
3′CATCAGGAGGGTTCAGCTTC; GAPDH,
5′TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC and

We purified total RNAs from mammospheres, tumorospheres (tumor-derived
mammospheres), and sorted cell populations with Trizol and prepared them using a
NucleoSpin RNA XS kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. We quantified RNAs using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer
and ascertained RNA quality with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). We
labeled 5 to 10 ng total RNAs and prepared biotinylated complementary RNAs according to
the standard Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetrix).
After fragmentation, we hybridized cRNA to a GeneChipMouse 430 2.0 Genome Array for
16 hr at 45 °C. After washing, we stained the chips in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450
and scanned them using an Affymetrix scanner. Un-normalized summary probe profiles,
with associated probe annotation, were output from Affymetrix GeneChip Operating
Software, version 1.04.
