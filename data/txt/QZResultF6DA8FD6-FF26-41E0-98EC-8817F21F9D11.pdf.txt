Abstract
3,3′-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is an anticancer agent that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through
unknown mechanisms. Here, we report that DIM can selectively induce proteasome-mediated degradation
of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8) without affecting the class II
HDAC proteins. DIM induced downregulation of class I HDACs in human colon cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo in tumor xenografts. HDAC depletion relieved HDAC-mediated transcriptional inhibition of
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1 and p27KIP2, significantly increasing their expression
and triggering cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, HDAC depletion was associated with an induction of DNA damage that triggered apoptosis. Our findings indicate that DIM acts
to selectively target the degradation of class I HDACs. Cancer Res; 70(2); 646–54. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Acetylation and deacetylation of the lysine residues on the
histone proteins play a key role in the regulation of gene transcription (1). Whereas histone acetyltransferases catalyze the
acetylation of histones and relax the chromatin to increase
the accessibility of transcription factors to the promoters of
the target genes, histone deacetylases (HDAC) remove the acetyl group from histones and repress transcription (2). Eighteen
mammalian HDACs have been identified and they are classified into four groups (3): class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2,
HDAC3, and HDAC8) have homology to the yeast protein
Rpd3, class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7,
HDAC9, and HDAC10) have homology to yeast HDAC Had-1,
class III HDACs (SIRT1–SIRT7) have homology to yeast Sir2
gene, and class IV HDAC (HDAC11) does not have sufficient
homology with both class I and class II HDACs. Class I HDACs
are often overexpressed in various types of cancers, comparing
with the corresponding normal tissues, and their overexpression is correlated with a poor prognosis (4–6). In contrast, the
expression of class II HDACs is associated with a better prognosis especially in non–small cell lung cancer and cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma. To target the HDAC enzymes, various smallmolecule inhibitors have been developed and they have been
shown to induce differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis

in cancer cells (7–9). Among the most potent HDAC inhibitors,
vorinostat [suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)] has been
approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
(10). Other HDAC inhibitors are subjects of extensive clinical
evaluations at various stages for treatment of different types
of cancers (11–13). Many of these HDAC inhibitors (such as
vorinostat) are broad-spectrum inhibitors and inhibit both
class I and class II HDACs, whereas a few are class I–specific
inhibitors (14).
3,3′-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is an anticancer agent naturally formed during the autolytic breakdown of glucobrassicin, which is present in food plants of the Brassica genus,
including broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower
(15). The antitumor activity of DIM was linked to the downregulation of androgen receptor (16) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (17) in prostate cancer cells. DIM
was also shown to inhibit mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase
and induce p21(Cip1/Waf1) expression in breast cancer cells
(18). Inhibition of AKT signaling and FLICE-like inhibitory
protein by DIM was reported in cholangiocarcinoma cells
(19), whereas inactivation of NF-κB (20) and downregulation
of survivin were shown in breast cancer cells treated with
DIM (21). DIM also inhibits angiogenesis and invasion by repressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and
urokinase-type plasminogen activator (22). However, it is still
not clear how these different effects of DIM eventually lead to
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
We have recently shown that DIM can enhance the antitumor activity of butyrate (a HDAC inhibitor) in a mouse
model of colon cancer (23). In this report, we find that
DIM selectively induces proteasome-mediated degradation
of the class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8)
in colon cancer cells. Downregulation of HDACs represents a
novel mechanism underlying the ability of DIM to induce cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis.

subcloned into a pCEP4-Flag vector to express Flag-tagged
proteins. Plasmids expressing Flag-tagged HDAC1 and
HDAC3 were obtained from Dr. Ed Seto's lab (H. Lee Moffitt
Cancer Center, Tampa, FL).
Tumor xenografts in nude mice. Six- to 8-wk-old female
nude mice (nu/nu) were purchased from Charles River. The
mice were maintained in sterile conditions using the IVC System from Innovive following the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of North Dakota
State University. Tumor xenografts were established by s.c. injection of 2 × 106 HT-29 cells in the flank area of the mice.
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% NP40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS). Complete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche) was added to lysis buffer before use. Protein
concentration was determined by detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were subjected to SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The
membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS overnight
and incubated with primary antibody and subsequently with
appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody. Signals were developed with enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and exposure to X-ray
films. Image digitization and quantification were performed

HDAC proteins were isolated from the cells using the ubiquitin
affinity resin of the Ubiquitin Enrichment kit from Pierce.
HDAC proteins were detected by Western blotting with antiFlag antibody.
Real-time PCR. The mRNA expression was measured by
real-time PCR using Taqman Gene Expression assays from Applied Biosystems. Total RNA was isolated from HT-29 cells
using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (5 μg) was used in reverse transcription reaction. The cDNAs were used as templates to perform PCR on an Applied Biosystems 7500
Real-time PCR System following the manufacturer's protocol.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using the
ChIP assay kit from Millipore following the supplied protocol. Immunoprecipitations were performed using antiHDAC1, anti-HDAC2, anti-HDAC3, anti-H3, anti–acetyl-H3,
or control IgG antibodies. PCR was performed with the primers designed from the sequences of the CDKN1A/WAF1/
CIP1 promoter (5′-GTGGCTCTGATTGGCTTTCTG-3′ and
5′-CTGAAAACAGGCAGCCCAAG-3′) and CDKN1B/KIP1 promoter (5′-GAGGCGGCGCGCTCGGGAAC-3′ and 5′-AGGGAGGCTGACGAAGAAGA-3′).
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed

the manufacturer's protocol.
Immunofluorescence staining. Cells grown in Lab-Tek II
chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) were washed with PBS and
fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The fixed
cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were
blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and
incubated with anti–phospho-KAP1 (S824) antibody (1:400
dilution) overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed and incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) at
1:250 dilution for 1 h at room temperature and counterstained with propidium iodide to visualize the nuclei. Cells
that were positive for KAP1 phosphorylation were counted
under a fluorescence microscope.
Comet assay. DNA damage was detected by Comet assay
using the Comet Assay kit from Trevigen. Alkaline electrophoresis was done at pH >13 (200 mmol/L NaOH, 1 mmol/L
EDTA). Images were taken with a fluorescence microscope
and analyzed with the CometScore software (TriTek).
Cross-linking study. DSS was dissolved in DMSO at
25 mmol/L concentration. Before protein isolation for
Western blot, cells were treated with 1 mmol/L DSS in PBS
for 30 min at 37°C. The stop solution (1 mol/L Tris; pH 7.5)
was then added to a final concentration of 10 mmol/L and
incubated for 15 min. Total protein was isolated and Western
blot was performed as described above.
Detection of apoptosis. The Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS
kit (Roche) was used to detect apoptosis following the manufacturer's protocol. This assay determines apoptosis by

of anti–histone-biotin and anti–DNA-peroxidase. The amount
of peroxidase retained in the immunocomplex was photometrically determined with ABTS as the substrate. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm.

Results
DIM selectively decreases the protein levels of the class I
HDACs. We have recently shown that DIM can enhance the
antitumor activity of HDAC inhibitor butyrate (23). To determine if DIM has a direct effect on the levels of HDAC proteins, we performed Western blot analysis on colon cancer
HT-29 cells treated with various doses of DIM. As shown in
Fig. 1A, exposure to DIM selectively decreased the levels of
class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3). However,
DIM had no effect on the levels of the class II HDACs
(HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, and HDAC7) or the class III
HDACs (SIRT2; Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1B; data not
shown). We have examined the effects of DIM on another
colon cancer cell line, SW620. DIM decreased the levels of
the class I HDACs in SW620 cells but had no effects on the
class II HDACs (Fig. 1B). The other class I HDAC, HDAC8,
was not expressed in HT-29 or SW620 cells. In HCT-116 colon cancer cells, DIM induced a significant decrease in the
levels of all four class I HDACs, including HDAC8 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). To determine if the effect of DIM on the
HDACs can be applied in general to other colon cancer cell
lines, we repeated the experiment using RKO and LS174T
cells. DIM was able to downregulate the class I HDACs in
all these colon cancer cell lines (data not shown). Because
both HT-29 and SW620 cells express mutant p53, the effects
of DIM on the HDAC proteins seem to be p53 independent.
Importantly, we found that DIM was able to downregulate
both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in vivo in HT-29 xenografts in nude
mice (Fig. 1C). DIM treatment did not decrease HDAC3 in the
tumor xenografts, reflecting a more complicated environment in the in vivo situation. Previously, it has been shown
that an oral dose of 250 mg/kg of DIM produced plasma
DIM concentration of 19 μg/mL in mice, which equals to

648

Cancer Res; 70(2) January 15, 2010

∼77 μmol/L (24). We did not observe any toxicity to the mice
even at the highest dose used (300 mg/kg/d).
Downregulation of HDACs by DIM is a result of proteasomal degradation. To understand the mechanism of DIMinduced decrease of the HDAC proteins, we first determined
if DIM could affect the mRNA expression of the HDACs. Using real-time PCR analysis, we found that treatment with
DIM had only minimal effect (causing ∼20% decreases) on
the levels of the mRNAs of class I HDACs (Fig. 2A). On the
other hand, DIM treatment did not inhibit the translation of
the mRNAs of the class I HDACs (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
We next examined if the proteasome-mediated protein degradation was involved in the downregulation of HDACs after
DIM treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment with DIM in
the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 did not result in the decrease of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 proteins.
DIM treatment also induced a decrease in the level of histone
H3 protein in HT-29 cells, which was also blocked by MG-132
(Fig. 2B). In contrast, cotreatment of HT-29 cells with a
broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD had no effects on
DIM-induced decreases in the HDACs and histone H3 protein (Fig. 2C), indicating that the decreases of these proteins
were not the result of the activation of apoptosis. Furthermore, by isolating ubiquitin-modified proteins in DIM-treated
cells, we showed that DIM treatment significantly induced
the formation of the ubiquitin-labeled HDAC1, HDAC2,
HDAC3, and HDAC8 (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Thus, ubiquitylation of the class I HDACs is involved in
the proteasome-mediated degradation of these proteins. It
has been shown that the E2 ubiquitin conjugase Ubc8 and
the E3 ubiquitin ligase RLIM are involved in the protein degradation of HDAC2 (25). However, we did not detect the expression of Ubc8 in HT-29 cells (data not shown) and RLIM
expression was not affected by DIM treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Furthermore, we observed a decrease of the
interaction between RLIM and HDAC2 after DIM treatment,
indicating that RLIM may not act as the E3 ubiquitin ligase
for HDAC2 in this situation (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Recently, a genome-wide screening identified HR23B as a critical factor for HDAC inhibitor–induced apoptosis (26). HR23B

shuttles ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. However,
we did not observe an induction of HR23B by DIM in HT-29
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Degradation of HDACs by DIM activates p21 and p27 expression. The class I HDACs have been linked to the transcriptional repression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)
inhibitor p21 (27), and the HDAC inhibitors have been
shown to induce cell cycle arrest by activating the expression of p21 and p27 (28, 29). We hypothesize that DIMinduced depletion of the class I HDACs can activate the
expression of p21 and p27 because the HDAC repression
on the promoters of these genes will be removed. As shown
in Fig. 3A, we found that treatment with DIM had induced
significant increases in the protein levels of both p21 and
p27 in HT-29 cells. Notably, DIM also induced p21 expression in vivo in the HT-29 xenografts in nude mice (Fig. 5B).
DIM had no effects on p27 in the tumor xenografts (data
not shown). To determine if the increase of p21 and p27
expression occurred at transcription level, we used real-time
PCR to measure the mRNA levels of p21 and p27 in HT-29
cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, exposure to DIM resulted in ∼10-

fold increase in the p21 mRNA and ∼23% increase in p27
mRNA expression. The global effects of DIM-induced HDAC
depletion on cellular histone acetylation were examined by
Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, whereas DIM
caused a decrease in the total protein level of histone H3,
the percentage of acetylated H3 was increased by about
20% to 25%. More importantly, we examined the effects of
DIM on the levels of HDAC proteins bound to the p21 and
p27 promoters in HT-29 cells. Using ChIP assays, we found
that DIM caused significant decreases (if not a complete
loss) in the levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 associated
with the p21 and p27 promoters (Fig. 3C and D). Whereas
DIM also induced a decrease in the amount of total histone
H3 bound to the p21 and p27 promoters, the relative levels
of acetylated H3 over total H3 on the p21 and p27 promoters
were increased by 2.49- and 31-fold, respectively (Fig. 3C and
D). The discrepancy between the effects of DIM on H3 acetylation within the p21 and p27 promoters and DIM-induced
p21 and p27 expression levels indicates that histone acetylation is not the only factor regulating the expression of these
genes. Other factors may also regulate the expression of p21

DIM-induced depletion of HDAC proteins.
DIM induces G2 cell cycle arrest. p21 and p27 can arrest
cells at both the G1 and G2 phases (30–33). The effects of DIM

on p21 and p27 expression led us to further examine how cell
cycle regulatory proteins and cell cycle progression itself
were affected by DIM treatment. Comparing with HDAC inhibitor SAHA, DIM had different effects on the protein levels
of cyclins and cdks (Fig. 4A). Whereas DIM significantly

decreased the levels of cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and cyclin D3,
SAHA did not affect the expression of these proteins. Both
DIM and SAHA decreased cdk4 expression without significantly affecting the level of cdk6 (Fig. 4A). We found that
DIM induced a G2-phase cell cycle arrest in HT-29 cells
(Fig. 4B). Whereas SAHA induced a G1-phase cell cycle arrest,
the combination of DIM and SAHA induced a more significant G2-phase arrest than when DIM was used alone
(Fig. 4B). SAHA was known to induce G1 or G2-M arrests
depending on the concentrations used (34).
DIM treatment causes DNA damage. Studies in the embryonic fibroblasts from HDAC3 knockout mouse have
shown that depletion of HDAC3 can cause DNA damage that
is associated with defective DNA double-strand break repair
(35). We hypothesize that by depleting all class I HDACs,
DIM can cause DNA damage in colon cancer cells. Phosphorylated H2AX (also named as γH2AX) has been used as a reliable indicator to measure DNA double-strand breaks (36).
We found that treatment with DIM caused a significant increase in the levels of γH2AX protein (Fig. 5A, left). To further
confirm the occurrence of DNA damage after DIM treatment,
we examined an additional marker of DNA damage response.
KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein) is phosphorylated on Ser824
in response to DNA damage, which relaxes the chromatin
(37). Using immunofluorescence staining, we observed a significant increase in the number of cells positively stained
with anti–phospho-KAP1 antibody in response to DIM treatment (Fig. 5A, right). Induction of γH2AX expression was also

observed in vivo in HT-29 xenografts in nude mice after DIM
treatment (Fig. 5B). We determined the time courses of DIMinduced HDAC degradation and found that the decrease of
HDACs occurred ∼24 hours ahead of the appearance of
γH2AX (Fig. 5C). Using quantitative Comet assay, we measured the time course of DIM-induced DNA damage. As
shown in Fig. 5D, the appearance of DNA damage in cells correlated with the decrease of the levels of the HDAC proteins.
DIM induces apoptosis and enhances HDAC inhibitor–
induced apoptosis. Because DIM caused significant
decreases in the levels of HDAC proteins as well as DNA
damage, we reasoned that DIM could induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells and enhance the effects of HDAC inhibitors
on HDAC inhibition and induction of apoptosis. We found
that treatment with DIM alone induced apoptosis in HT-29
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Pretreatment
with low dose of DIM also significantly enhanced SAHA-induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells (Fig. 6B, left). Similarly, DIM
treatment significantly potentiated apoptosis induced by another HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (Fig. 6B, right). Using
the CalcuSyn software, we showed that the combinations
of DIM/SAHA and DIM/trichostatin A were synergistic (combination index < 1) in apoptosis induction at most doses
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). A combination of low doses of
DIM and SAHA treatment triggered the formation of dimerized proapoptotic protein Bak (Fig. 6C), representing the activated Bak (38, 39). The dimerization of Bak was not seen in
cells treated with either DIM or SAHA alone. We also found

that caspase-7 and caspase-9 were activated by the DIM/
SAHA combination treatment (indicated by the appearance
of cleaved caspase-7 and cleaved caspase-9) but not by the
individual agent alone (Fig. 6D). To determine the role of
downregulation of individual HDAC protein in the enhancement of SAHA-induced apoptosis, we knocked down the individual class I HDAC protein in HCT-116 cell by small
interfering RNA (siRNA; Supplementary Fig. S3B) and analyzed the effects of siRNA knockdown on responses to SAHA.
Knockdown of HDAC2 or HDAC3 by siRNA exhibited most
significant enhancement of SAHA-induced apoptosis in these
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). The data suggest that DIMinduced degradation of the class I HDACs (especially HDAC2
and HDAC3) can directly enhance the activity of a HDAC inhibitor in apoptosis induction.

Discussion
DIM has been intensively evaluated as an antitumor agent
in various types of cancers (40). However, the mechanism of
its activity in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis has not
been defined. In this study, we show that DIM selectively induces proteasomal degradation of the class I HDACs
(HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8). Downregulation of
the HDACs by DIM not only activates the expression of

p21 and p27 to cause cell cycle arrest but also induces
DNA damage to trigger apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Thus,
our data establish a mechanistic basis for the antitumor activity of DIM. Because the cells used in our experiments express mutant p53, our results also provide a mechanism for
the p53-independent activation of p21 and p27 by DIM. Reduction of the levels of the HDAC proteins that are bound to
the p21 and p27 promoters derepresses the transcription of
these genes.
It is recently reported that DIM induces p21 expression by
inhibiting the mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase and causing
oxidative stress in human breast cancer cells (18). We did
observe increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
in DIM-treated HT-29 cells, which was suppressed by coincubation with antioxidants (vitamin E plus vitamin C).
However, the antioxidants did not block DIM-mediated
downregulation of the class I HDACs or the induction of
γH2AX and p21 (Supplementary Fig. S2C), indicating
that ROS production was not a critical mechanism in these
cells.
The HDAC inhibitors act by inhibiting the catalytic activity
of HDAC enzymes. These agents are often broad-spectrum
inhibitors that target many of the class I, II, and IV HDAC
isoforms (e.g., vorinostat, panobinostat, and belinostat).
In contrast, DIM selectively induces protein degradation
of the class I HDACs. Very few agents have ever been found

Figure 6. DIM induces apoptosis and enhances HDAC inhibitor–induced apoptosis. A, HT-29 cells were treated with various doses of DIM for 24 h.
Apoptosis was analyzed using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit as described in Materials and Methods. B, HT-29 cells were treated with or without
20 μmol/L of DIM for 24 h followed by various doses of SAHA or trichostatin A (TSA) for additional 24 h. Apoptosis was analyzed as described in A.
The average results from three independent experiments were shown. C, DIM/SAHA treatment induced Bak activation. HT-29 cells were treated with
20 μmol/L DIM for 24 h, 2 μmol/L SAHA for 24 h, or 20 μmol/L DIM for 24 h followed by 2 μmol/L SAHA for additional 24 h. Bak dimerization was detected
by cross-linking experiments as described in Materials and Methods. Protein lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. D, HT-29 cells were treated
as described in C, and Western blot was performed using the indicated antibodies.

DIM Induces HDAC Degradation

to possess this type of activity (i.e., inducing HDAC degradation). Whereas valproic acid was shown to induce HDAC2
degradation (25), tumor necrosis factor-α was reported to deplete HDAC1 (41). However, these agents only cause the degradation of a single HDAC enzyme but not the rest of class I
HDACs. In comparison, DIM selectively induces the degradation of all class I HDACs. Class I HDACs are often overexpressed in various types of cancers, and the elevation of
these proteins correlates with a poor prognosis. On the other
hand, the expression of the class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5,
HDAC6, HDAC7, and HDAC10) is associated with a better
prognosis (14). This suggests that class II HDACs should be
avoided in therapy targeting the HDAC enzymes. By selectively targeting class I HDACs for degradation, DIM offers an
advantage over the pan-HDAC inhibitors in cancer treatment.
HDACs are components of high–molecular weight multisubunit complexes of corepressor proteins that are recruited
by transcription factors to the promoters to regulate gene expression. DIM-induced degradation of the class I HDACs will
result in a disruption of the protein-protein interactions
among the HDACs and other proteins in these corepressor
complexes. Such effects could not be achieved by HDAC inhibitors, which may not significantly affect the protein inter-

actions. Because of this, DIM may produce different
antitumor activities from those of the HDAC inhibitors.
