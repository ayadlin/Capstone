ABSTRACT
Aerobic glycolysis (production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen)
is a hallmark of cancer. Fenofibrate is a lipid-lowering drug and an agonist of the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). We found that FF inhibited
glycolysis in a PPARα-dependent manner in glioblastoma cells. Fenofibrate inhibited
the transcriptional activity of NF-κB/RelA and also disrupted its association with
hypoxia inducible factor1 alpha (HIF1α), which is required for the binding of NF-κB/
RelA to the PKM promoter and PKM2 expression. High ratios of PKM2/PKM1 promote
glycolysis and inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, thus favoring aerobic glycolysis.
Fenofibrate decreased the PKM2/PKM1 ratio and caused mitochondrial damage. Given
that fenofibrate is a widely used non-toxic drug, we suggest its use in patients with
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

hnRNPI), hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2, alternatively splice
transcripts of the PKM gene and facilitate the generation
of PKM2 [7]. Furthermore, NF-κB/RelA upregulates PKM
transcription, depending on its interaction with HIF1α [8].
Expression of PKM2 is critical for cancer cell growth,
including glioblastoma [9]. Switching from PKM2 to
PKM1 in human lung cancer cells reduced the ability to
form tumors in nude mouse xenografts [10].
The nuclear factor kappa enhancer-binding protein
(NF-κB) family is composed of structurally homologous
transcription factors, including NF-κB1 (p50 and its
precursor, p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor, p100),
RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel [11]. All five family members
have a Rel homology domain that is responsible for DNA
binding and dimerization between different or identical
family members, leading to homomeric or heteromeric
binding of the subunits. In an inactive state, NF-κB is
sequestered in the cytoplasm as homomeric or heteromeric
and IκB subunits. In response to stimulation, NF-κB,
predominantly the p65/p50 dimer, is released from binding
to IκB and transfers to the nucleus and then binds to a
specific consensus sequence in the DNA, which results in
gene transcription [12]. Activation of NF-κB is associated
poor survival [13].

INTRODUCTION
The metabolism of tumor cells is characterized by
elevated glucose uptake and lactate production even in the
presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as “Warburg
effect” or “aerobic glycolysis” [1, 2].
As the rate-limiting final step of glycolysis,
Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme (PK) catalyzes the conversion
of phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) to pyruvate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
[3]. Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM1) and
Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) are two
isoforms of PK. PKM1 and PKM2 exclusively contain
exon 9 and exon 10, respectively, and are both encoded
by the PKM gene using the same promoter [4]. The
single exon difference endows the enzymes with distinct
expression patterns and functions. PKM2 is expressed
in embryonic, proliferating, and cancer cells, whereas
PKM1 is expressed in normal differentiated tissues. High
ratios of PKM2/PKM1 promote glycolysis but inhibit
oxidative phosphorylation [5, 6]. To ensure a high ratio
of PKM2/PKM1 in cancer cells, three heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) proteins, including
polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB, also known as

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
α (PPARα) is a nuclear receptor, which belongs to the
superfamily of steroid hormone receptors [14]. PPARα
has anti-inflammatory properties due to inhibition of NFκB/RelA [15]. Fenofibrate (FF) is a ligand of PPARα, has
been shown to exert interesting anticancer properties [16,
17], which is rapidly converted to fenofibric acid (FA) in
vivo by tissue and plasma esterases before entering the
cell [18]. Wilk et al. reported that FF induced metabolic
catastrophe and glioblastoma cell death involving the
AMPK-mTOR-autophagy pathway [19].
Here we show that FF not only inhibits glucose
uptake and lactate production but also induces mitochon­
drial damage in human glioblastoma cells. FF also causes
NF-κB/RelA-dependent downregulation of PKM2
expression, depending on PPARα.

that FF significantly inhibited glycolysis in a dose-dependent
manner (25–100 μM). Next, we also explored whether
PPARα is involved in its anti-glycolysis action. GW9662,
a synthetic PPARγ inhibitor, also blocks PPARα at higher
concentrations (10 μM) [20]. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S1, FF increased PPARα transcriptional activity in a
dose-dependent manner and GW9662 significantly decreased
PPARα transcriptional activity. Then ECAR in the presence
of FF (FF100) and GW9662 (10 μM) was tested in U87 and
U251 glioblastoma cells. The results indicated that the action
of FF on glioblastoma cell glycolysis is PPARα dependent
(Figure 1B).

NF-κB/RelA transcriptionally induces PKM2
The PKM promoter, containing NF-κB/RelAbinding sites, was cloned into the luciferase reporter
plasmid pGL3 (Figure 2A). The plasmid was cotransfected with the RelA overexpression plasmid alone
or in combination with sh-HIF1α in U87 and U251
glioblastoma cells. Results in Figure 2B and Figure 2C
demonstrate that the overexpression of NF-κB/RelA
enhanced the activity of luciferase construction in
the presence of HIF1α, which was consistent with the
findings of a previous study [8]. The HnRNP protein
family could alternatively splice transcripts of the
PKM gene. We checked the effect of NF-κB/RelA on

REULTS
FF suppresses glioblastoma cells glycolysis
We determined the effect of FF on glycolysis of
U87 and U251 glioblastoma cells using the XF analyzer to
perform glycolysis stress test assays. Both glioblastoma cell
lines were treated FF at different concentrations including
0 μM (Con), 25 μM (FF25), 50 μM (FF50), and 100 μM
(FF100) for 48 h. The results shown in Figure 1A indicate

the expression of PKM1, PKM2, hnRNPΙ, hnRNPA1,
and hnRNPA2 in U87 and U251 glioblastoma cells.
Western blot analysis depicted in Figure 2D revealed
that the expression level of PKM2 was remarkably
increased, whereas that of PKM1 was slightly increased.
On the other hand, the HnRNPs protein level was
not significantly affected by RelA overexpression.
Furthermore, NF-κB/RelA obviously promoted
glioblastoma cell glycolysis depending on PKM2
(Figure 2E) but not PKM1 (data not shown).

Following this, to determine whether NF-κB/RelA
is responsible for FF-mediated anti-glycolysis in
glioblastoma cells, we performed glycolysis stress test
assays. The results in Figure 3F demonstrated that NFκB/RelA overexpression obviously reversed FF-induced
inhibition of glycolysis. Interestingly, the PKM2
protein level was remarkably attenuated, whereas the
expression of PKM1 did not change (Figure 3D). FFinduced suppression of hnRNPA1 and hnRNPΙ may
contribute to this interesting result (Figure 3E).

NF-κB/RelA is involved in FF-induced inhibition
of glycolysis

FF promotes mitochondrial damage
High ratios of PKM1/PKM2 elevate the glucose
flux into oxidative phosphorylation and then enhance O2
consumption. Although FF significantly reversed ratios of
PKM2/PKM1 in the glioblastoma cells, O2 consumption
was incredibly reduced (Figure 4). The ultrastructural
morphology of mitochondria in glioblastoma cell was
observed by a routine TEM (Figure 5). TEM images
showed that FF promoted mitochondrial structural
damage, including mitochondrial swelling and disruptions
or integration of mitochondrial crest, compared with the
control group, which may lead to their dysfunction.

It has been reported that PPARα interacts with
RelA and the interaction region contains RHD, which
mediates DNA binding [15]. In glioblastoma cells, the
interaction of PPARα and RelA only appeared in the
cytoplasm. Treatment with FF (FF100) significantly
promoted the interaction of PPARα and RelA in the
cytoplasm (Figure 3A). FF-mediated activation of
PPARα not only notably suppressed NF-κB/RelA
transcriptional activity but also promoted the separation
of NF-κB/RelA and HIF1α (Figure 3B and Figure 3C).

dose-related manner depending on PPARα activation. The
role of NF-κB activation during inflammatory response
has been intensively studied [26]. PPARα represses
inflammatory genes that can be ascribed to the PPARα
antagonistic action against NF-κB/RelA [15]. Furthermore,
NF-κB/RelA is implicated in many hallmarks of cancer,
including proliferation, prevention of apoptosis, and
promotion of angiogenesis and metastasis [27, 28]. NF-κB/
RelA promotes aerobic glycolysis through transcriptional
activation of Glut3 [29] and PKM2 [8]. In the present
study, FF inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-κB/
RelA and dissociated RelA and HIF1α, which is required
for the binding of NF-κB/RelA to the PKM promoter and
PKM2 expression. In addition, NF-κB/RelA-dependent
PKM transcription acts in coordination with splicing of premRNA, which is mediated by FF-induced downregulation
of hnRNPA1 and hnRNPΙ, leading to reduced expression
of PKM2 but not PKM1. Thus, NF-κB/RelA-PKM2 is
involved in FF-induced inhibition of glycolysis.
The high ratio of PKM1/PKM2 favors oxidative
phosphorylation and enhances O2 consumption
[5]. Mitochondria produce ATP through oxidative
phosphorylation [30]. FF increased the ratio of PKM1/
PKM2, unimaginably accompanied with the reduction
of O2 consumption. Previous studies have shown that the
agents including FF hampered mitochondrial respiration
[31, 32]. In our study, FF damaged mitochondria. Scatena
et al. suggested possible molecular mechanisms (ROS
generation) of mitochondrial impairment [33].
GBM is characterized by rapid growth, resistance
to radio- and chemotherapy and relentless invasion of
the central nervous system, and it remains practically
incurable [34]. NF-κB/RelA is a potential target for

Considering the remarkable anti-glioblastoma
effects of FF in vitro, we extended our investigation to test
if FF could attenuate glioblastoma growth in vivo using
nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging showed inhibition
of the tumor growth in FF-treated group compared
with the control group (Figure 6A). We also evaluated
PPARα, RelA, PKM1/2 and hnRNPs protein expression
by Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in a nude mouse
glioma xenograft model to study the correlation among
them. The results in Figure 6B revealed that the nuclear
expression level of PPARα was increased and that of RelA
was decreased. PKM2, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPΙ expression
was significantly decreased, whereas PKM1 and hnRNPA2
had no obvious change. These results in vivo and vitro
provide demonstration of the role of FF in the regulation
of the PPARα/ RelA/PKM2 pathway in glioma (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
Proliferating cancer cells require not only ATP but
also large amounts of glucose carbons for macromolecular
synthesis [21]. Therefore, cancer cells metabolize glucose
by glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation even
when oxygen is abundant, which has been termed aerobic
glycolysis [1].
Fenofibrate (FF) is used to treat hyperlipidemia
and hypercholesterolemia [22]. FF has antiproliferative,
antimetastatic, and pro-apoptotic effects in tumors
of neuroectodermal origin, including melanoma,
medulloblastoma, and glioblastoma [23–25]. In our study,
we confirmed that FF inhibits glioblastoma glycolysis in a

NF-κB/RelA transcription factor assay

Immunohistochemistry staining

After FF treatment, nuclear proteins were extracted
using the Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Fractionation Kit
(KenGEN, China). Equal amounts of protein were used to
determine NF-κB/RelA transcriptional activity depending
on the NF-κB/RelA Transcription Factor Assay (Abcam,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The
absorbance was determined using a microplate reader
(Bio-Rad, USA) at 450-nm wavelength.

Paraffin-embedded xenograft tumor sections were
incubated with diluted primary antibodies against PPARα,
RelA, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, hnRNPΙ, PKM2 and PKM1
overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the sections were incubated
with a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution,
Gene Tech, China) at room temperature for 1 h and then
the sections were incubated with ABC-peroxidase for
1 h, washed with PBS and stained with diaminobenzidine
for 5 min, counterstained with hematoxylin (Gene Tech,
China). Six randomly selected visual fields per section were
examined by light microscope to evaluate the expression
of PPARα, RelA, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, hnRNPΙ, PKM2
and PKM1. Sections with no labeling or with fewer than
5% labeled cells were scored as 0. Sections with 5%–30%
of cells labeled were scored as 1, with 31%–70% of cells
labeled as 2, and with labeling of ≥71% as 3. The staining
intensity was scored similarly, with 0 used for negative
staining, 1 for weakly positive, 2 for moderately positive,
and 3 for strongly positive. The scores for the percentage of
positive tumor cells and for the staining intensity were added
to generate an immunoreactive score for each specimen. The
product of the quantity and intensity scores were calculated
such that a final score of 0–1 indicated negative expression
(−), 2–3 indicated weak expression (+), 4–5 indicated
moderate expression (++), and 6 indicated strong expression
(+++). Each sample was examined separately and scored by
2 pathologists. Cases with discrepancies in the scores were
discussed to reach a consensus.

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
Co-IP is an effective means of quantifying protein–
protein interactions in cells. First, subcellular fractionation
was applied to separate cytoplasmic and nuclear
proteins using the Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Fractionation
Kit (KenGEN, China). Following this, equal amounts
of nuclear/cytoplasmic proteins were labeled using
anti-PPARα (Abcam, USA) or anti-RelA (CST, USA)
following overnight incubation at 4°C. The protein–
antibody immunoprecipitates were collected by protein
A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz, USA). Following the final
wash, the samples with 1 × SDS were boiled. The PPARα
and RelA proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.

Western blot analysis
All proteins were extracted after lysing cells in RIPA
lysis buffer (KenGEN, China). Equal amounts of protein
were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Thermo
Scientific, USA). Membranes were blocked for 2 h with
5% nonfat milk and then incubated at room temperature
with primary antibody, followed by incubation with a
secondary antibody for 2 h. Immunoblot analysis used the
following primary antibodies: PPARα (1:1000; Abcam,
USA); hnRNPA1 (1:1000; Abcam, USA); hnRNPA2
(1:1000; Abcam, USA); hnRNPΙ (1:5000; Abcam, USA);
RelA (1:1000; CST, USA); HIF1α (1: 200; Santa Cruz,
USA); PKM2 (1:1000; CST, USA); PKM1 (1:1000;
SIGMA, USA); and β-actin (1:1000; CST, USA).

Statistical analysis
Results are provided as means ± standard deviations
(SDs) of at least three independent experiments. Statistical
comparisons were made using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and Student’s t-tests (two-tailed) with
an SPSS 13.0 software package. P-values of < 0.5 were
considered significant.
