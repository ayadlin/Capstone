Abstract
We have reported previously low expression of death receptors
for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) in fresh isolates and tissue sections of melanoma. This seemed to correlate with relative resistance of
freshly isolated melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
We show in this study that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress inducer, tunicamycin, selectively up-regulated the cell
surface expression of TRAIL-R2, but not other members of the
TNF receptor family, and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in cultured melanoma cells and fresh melanoma isolates.
Tunicamycin-mediated sensitization of melanoma cells to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis was associated with increased
activation of the caspase cascade and reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and was inhibited by a recombinant
TRAIL-R2/Fc chimeric protein. Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 on
the melanoma cell surface was associated with increased
transcription of TRAIL-R2 and its total protein levels. Two
signaling pathways of the ER stress-induced unfolded protein
response mediated by inositol-requiring transmembrane
kinase and endonuclease 1A (IRE1A) and activation of
transcription factor 6 (ATF6), respectively, seemed to be
involved. In one melanoma line, there was clear evidence of
activation of the IRE1A pathway, and small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown of IRE1A substantially reduced the upregulation of TRAIL-R2. Similarly, there was evidence for the
activation of the ATF6 pathway, and siRNA knockdown of
ATF6 had a delayed effect on TRAIL-R2 expression in one but
not another melanoma cell line. Moreover, the transcription
factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein
seemed to be involved in the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by
tunicamycin, but its role varied between different melanoma
lines. Taken together, our results suggest that agents that
induce ER stress may enhance TRAIL-R2 expression and
increase the therapeutic response to TRAIL in melanoma.

selective cytotoxicity against malignancies (1–3). The potential
significance of TRAIL as an anticancer agent has been supported
by studies in animal models showing selective toxicity to human
tumor xenografts but not normal tissues (4, 5). Induction of
apoptosis by TRAIL is mediated by its interaction with two death
domain–containing receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. This, in
turn, orchestrates the assembly of the death-inducing signaling
complex that contains adapter components such as Fas-associated
death domain that activates initiator caspases, caspase-8 and
caspase-10, leading eventually to the activation of effector caspases
such as caspase-3 and apoptosis (1–3).
We have previously shown that the sensitivity of cultured
melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is, in general,
correlated with the levels of the cell surface expression of TRAIL
death receptors, in particular, TRAIL-R2 (6, 7). Subsequent studies
showed that fresh melanoma isolates are relatively resistant to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis due to low levels of TRAIL-death
receptor expression (8). Moreover, melanoma cells selected for
TRAIL resistance by prolonged exposure to TRAIL express substantially reduced levels of TRAIL-R2 on their surface (9, 10).
Studies on melanoma tissue sections revealed that reduced TRAILR2 expression is associated with disease progression and a poor
prognosis (11). Taken together, these studies indicate that
melanoma may not respond to treatment with TRAIL unless given
with agents that increase the cell surface expression of TRAIL
death receptors, in particular, TRAIL-R2.
The cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the
unfolded protein response (UPR), consists of three distinct yet
coordinated signaling pathways initiated, respectively, by inositolrequiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1a (IRE1a),
activation of transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and protein kinase-like
ER kinase (PERK; refs. 12–14). As an adaptive response, the UPR
is activated to alleviate the stress condition imposed on the ER
and is orchestrated by transcriptional activation of multiple genes
mediated by IRE1a and ATF6, a general decrease in translation
initiation, and selective translation of specific mRNAs mediated by
PERK (12–14). However, if the stress on ER remains unresolved,
prolonged activation of the UPR can lead to apoptosis (12–14).
Tunicamycin, a naturally occurring antibiotic that induces ER
stress by inhibiting the first step in the biosynthesis of N-linked
oligosaccharides in cells (15), was reported to sensitize human
colon and prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via the
up-regulation of TRAIL-R1 and/or TRAIL-R2 (16, 17). However, a
potential role of the UPR in the regulation of TRAIL death receptor
expression by ER stress inducers has not been fully studied. In
addition, the effect of ER stress on the expression of TRAIL death
receptors in melanoma cells remains unknown.
In the present report, we show that tunicamycin selectively
up-regulated the cell surface expression of TRAIL-R2 and enhanced

Tunicamycin Sensitizes Melanoma to TRAIL

TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cultured melanoma cells and fresh
melanoma isolates. Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 expression on the
cell surface was associated with enhanced TRAIL-R2 gene transcription and elevated TRAIL-R2 total protein levels. We show, for
the first time, that the IRE1a- and ATF6-mediated signaling pathways of the UPR contribute to the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by
tunicamycin in melanoma cells in a cell line–dependent manner.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human melanoma cell lines Mel-RM, MM200, IgR3, Mel-CV,
Me4405, Sk-Mel-28, and Mel-FH have been described previously and were
cultured in DMEM containing 5% FCS (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories; refs. 6, 18). Melanocytes were kindly provided by Dr. P. Parsons
(Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia) and
cultured in medium supplied by Clonetics (Edward Kellar). Human
umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were kindly supplied by D.
Clark (Transplantation Unit, John Hunter Hospital, Australia) and were
cultured as described elsewhere (19). The cell line of human embryonic
fibroblasts, FLOW 2000, was cultured in DMEM containing 5% FCS as
described previously (20).
Fresh melanoma isolates. Isolation of melanoma cells from fresh
surgical specimens was carried out as described previously (8).
Antibodies, recombinant proteins, and other reagents. Tunicamycin
was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.. It was dissolved in DMSO to
make up a stock solution of 1 mmol/L. Recombinant human TRAIL and
the TRAIL-R2/Fc chimera were supplied by Immunex. The mouse
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, TRAIL-R3,
TRAIL-R4, Fas, TNF-R1, and TNF-R2 were also supplied by Immunex. The
cell-permeable general caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH 2F
(z-VAD-fmk) and the caspase-8–specific inhibitor Z-lle-Glu(Ome)Thr-Asp(Ome)-CH2F (z-IETD-fmk) were purchased from Calbiochem.
The rabbit polyclonal Abs against caspase-3 and caspase-8 were from
Stressgen. The mouse mAbs against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
and Bid were from PharMingen. The rabbit mAbs against immunoglobulin-binding protein (Bip), eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a),
phosphorylated eIF2a, x-box–binding protein 1 (XBP1), IRE1a, ATF6,
PERK, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein
(CHOP), were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Isotype control
Abs used were the ID4.5 [mouse immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) mAb against
Salmonella typhi supplied by Dr. L. Ashman (Institute for Medical and
Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia), the 107.3 mouse IgG1 mAb
purchased from PharMingen, and rabbit IgG from Sigma Chemical Co.
Flow cytometry. Immunostaining on intact and permeabilized cells was
carried out as described previously (6, 18). Analysis was carried out using a
Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer.
Apoptosis. Quantitation of apoptotic cells by measurement of sub-G1
DNA content using the propidium iodide method was carried out as
described elsewhere (6, 18).
Mitochondrial membrane potential (#8m). Melanoma cells were
seeded at 1  105 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to reach
exponential growth for 24 h before treatment. Changes in DCm were
studied by staining the cells with the cationic dye, JC-1, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes) as described previously
(9, 21).
Confocal microscopy. Melanoma cells seeded onto glass coverslips
were subject to formaldehyde fixation before indirect immunofluorescent
staining. Primary antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 488–
conjugated anti-mouse Ig, and the Golgi apparatus was decorated using
Alexa Fluor 594–labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; Invitrogen). After
staining, coverslips were mounted with SlowFade Gold medium (Invitrogen), and confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 scanner
fitted to an Axiovert 100M microscope. Alexa-488 images were acquired
using a BP500-550 IR filter with excitation at 488 nm using an argon laser.
Alexa-594 images were acquired using a LP560 filter with excitation at
543 nm using a helium neon laser. Dual-color analysis was done with

www.aacrjournals.org

appropriate single-color controls with individual channels recorded
sequentially. Instrument settings were adjusted to obtain minimal saturated
pixels, and where semiquantitative comparisons were done, the settings
were kept constant.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was carried out as
described previously (9, 21). Labeled bands were detected by Immun-Star
HRP Chemiluminescent Kit, and images were captured, and the intensity
of the bands was quantitated with the Bio-Rad VersaDoc image system
(Bio-Rad).
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated with spin or vacuum (SV) total
RNA isolation system (Promega). Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out
using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) transcriptase and Oligo d(T),
and the resulting cDNA products were used as templates for real-time PCR
assays. Real-time PCR was done using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems). For TRAIL-R2, 25 AL mixture was
used for reaction, which contains 5 AL cDNA sample (0.5–1 Ag/AL), 300
nmol/L forward primers for TRAIL-R2 (CGCTGCACCAGGTGTGATT), 300
nmol/L reverse primers for TRAIL-R2 (GTGCCGGCTTCGCACTGACA),
200 nmol/L probes for TRAIL-R2 (6FAM-CCCTGCACCACGACCAGAAACACAG-TAMRA), and 9 mmol/L MgCI2. After incubation at 50jC for 2 min
followed by 95jC for 10 min, the reaction was carried out for 45 cycles of
the following: 95jC for 15 s and 60.6jC for 45 s. For TRAIL-R1, assay-ondemand for TRAIL-R1 (Assay ID: Hs01560092-g1) was used according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of cDNA for h-actin
was included as a control. The threshold cycle value (C t) was normalized
against h-actin cycle numbers. The relative abundance of mRNA expression
of a control sample was arbitrarily designated as 1, and the values of the
relative abundance of mRNA of other samples were calculated accordingly.
Small interfering RNA. Melanoma cells were seeded at 3.5  104 cells
per well in 24-well plates and allowed to reach f50% confluence on the
day of transfection. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs used
were obtained as the siGENOME SMARTpool reagents (Dharmacon),
the siGENOME SMARTpool IRE1a (M-004951-01-0010), the siGENOME
SMARTpool ATF6 (M-009917-01-0010), the siGENOME SMARTpool CHOP
(M-004819-01-0010). The nontargeting siRNA control, SiConTRolNontargeting SiRNA pool (D-001206-13-20) was also obtained from Dharmacon.
Cells were transfected with 50–100 nmol/L siRNA in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen)
with 5% FCS using the OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s transfection protocol. Efficiency of siRNA was measured by Western blot analysis 24 h after transfection.

Results
Tunicamycin selectively up-regulates TRAIL-R2 on the
melanoma cell surface. In the search for agents that increase
TRAIL death receptor expression on the melanoma cell surface,
we found that the ER stress inducer tunicamycin markedly
up-regulated the cell surface expression of TRAIL-R2 in both MelRM and MM200 cells, with a significant increase being detected at
16 h, and further increases at 24 and 36 h after exposure to the
compound (Fig. 1A and B). In contrast, tunicamycin did not induce
any change in the expression of the other TNF receptor family
members, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, Fas, TNF-R1, and TNFR2 on the cell surface; neither did it cause up-regulation of TRAILR2 on the surface of normal cells, including melanocytes,
fibroblasts, and HUVECs (Fig. 1A and C, and data not shown).
Studies on a panel of melanoma cell lines revealed that tunicamycin
could up-regulate TRAIL-R2 on the cell surface in all but Sk-Mel-110
(Fig. 1C).
Up-regulation of the cell surface expression of TRAIL-R2 in
melanoma cells by tunicamycin was confirmed in studies using
confocal microscopy (Fig. 1D). As was reported before (22), TRAILR2 in melanoma cells was predominantly located in the Golgi
network with a small proportion of the protein being detected
on the cell surface before treatment. However, after exposure to

tunicamycin for 24 h, there was a marked increase in the cell
surface expression of TRAIL-R2.
Tunicamycin sensitizes melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. To study if up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin
results in increased sensitivity of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, we treated Mel-RM and MM200 cells with tunicamycin
at 3 Amol/L for 16 h before the addition of TRAIL (200 ng/mL) for
a further 24 h. Figure 2A shows that tunicamycin alone did not
induce significant apoptosis, whereas TRAIL induced apoptosis
in 31.2% of Mel-RM and 46.5% of MM200 cells. As expected,
pretreatment with tunicamycin markedly enhanced TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in both cell lines (Fig. 2A). In association with this, pretreatment with tunicamycin enhanced TRAIL-induced activation
of caspase-8 and Bid, reduction in DCm, activation of caspase-3,
and cleavage of its substrate PARP (Fig. 2B).

The role of up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 in the sensitization of
melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by tunicamycin was
further studied by the inhibition of the interaction between TRAIL
and TRAIL-R2 using a TRAIL-2/Fc chimeric protein. Figure 2C
shows that the TRAIL-R2/Fc chimera significantly inhibited TRAILinduced apoptosis in the absence or presence of tunicamycin.
Similarly, tunicamycin-mediated sensitization of melanoma cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was blocked by either the general
caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk or the caspase-8–specific inhibitor
z-IETD-fmk (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results indicate that
the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 expression on the cell surface is
responsible for the sensitization of melanoma cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis by tunicamycin.
Tunicamycin-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
was confirmed in a large panel of melanoma cell lines as shown in

tunicamycin up-regulates TRAIL-R2 expression in melanoma cells,
we quantitated TRAIL-R2 mRNA expression in Mel-RM and MM200
cells before and after exposure to the compound for varying
intervals. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with tunicamycin upregulated the levels of TRAIL-R2 mRNA in both cell lines with a
marked increase being observed at 16 h and further increases at
24 and 36 h. In contrast, there was no alteration in the levels of
TRAIL-R1 mRNA after exposure to tunicamycin (Fig. 3A).
We next studied if the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 mRNA leads to
increased TRAIL-R2 total protein levels by measuring TRAIL-R2
expression in permeabilized Mel-RM and MM200 cells in flow
cytometry. Figure 3B shows that tunicamycin induced a marked
increase in the levels of the TRAIL-R2 total protein with a similar
kinetics to that of the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 mRNA (Fig. 3A).
However, it was of note that the levels of the TRAIL-R2 total
protein experienced a transient decrease at early stages after
exposure to tunicamycin at 6 h in both cell lines. Up-regulation of
the TRAIL-R2 total protein levels by tunicamycin was confirmed by
Western blot analysis of TRAIL-R2 expression in whole cell lysates
from Mel-RM and MM200 cells treated with tunicamycin for
varying intervals (Fig. 3C).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

The role of the IRE1A-mediated signaling pathway of the
UPR in up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin in
melanoma cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, exposure of either MelRM or MM200 cells to tunicamycin resulted in the up-regulation of
the ER chaperone protein Bip, induction of the UPR effector XBP1,
phosphorylation of the translation initiator eIF2a increases in
the expression of the UPR transducers, IRE1a and ATF6, and
appearance of the cleaved form of ATF6 (12–14). Moreover, another
UPR transducer, PERK was phosphorylated as evidenced by the
appearance of an extra band with reduced electrophoretic motility,
which corresponds to phosphorylated PERK (23). These observations confirmed that treatment with tunicamycin initiated the UPR
in both cell lines. However, the changes in XBP1, IRE1a, ATF6, and
PERK occurred more rapidly and were more pronounced in MelRM than in MM200 cells.
To elucidate if any of the UPR signaling pathways plays a role in
the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin in melanoma
cells, we silenced the UPR transducer IRE1a by transfecting an
IRE1a-specific siRNA construct into Mel-RM and MM200 cells. As
shown in Fig. 4B, siRNA knockdown of IRE1a markedly inhibited
its basal expression and its up-regulation by tunicamycin in both
cell lines. Figure 4C shows that the inhibition of IRE1a efficiently
blocked the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin in Mel-RM
cells, which could be observed at either 16 or 36 h after treatment
with tunicamycin. However, IRE1a siRNA had no effect on
tunicamycin-mediated up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 in MM200 cells
(Fig. 4C).
The role of the ATF6-mediated signaling pathway of the UPR
in the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin in melanoma
cells. We also examined if the ATF6-mediated signaling pathway of
the UPR plays a role in tunicamycin-mediated up-regulation of
TRAIL-R2 in melanoma cells by transfecting an ATF6-specific
siRNA construct into Mel-RM and MM200 cells. As shown in
Fig. 4B, siRNA knockdown of ATF6 significantly reduced its
expression levels as either the native p90 form or as the cleaved
p50 form in cells before and after treatment with tunicamycin.
Figure 4D shows that the inhibition of ATF6 blocked up-regulation
of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin in Mel-RM cells. However, the inhibitory effect could only be observed by 36 h after exposure to the
compound, whereas at 16 h, the increase was minimally affected.
Similar to the inhibition of IRE1a, inhibition of ATF6 by siRNA had
no effect on tunicamycin-induced up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 in
MM200 cells (Fig. 4D).
CHOP is involved in the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by
tunicamycin in melanoma cells. We studied the expression of the
transcription factor CHOP, which is also a UPR effector (12–14), in
Mel-RM and MM200 cells before and after treatment with
tunicamycin. As shown in Fig. 5A, CHOP was constitutively
expressed at relatively high levels in both cell lines, but surprisingly,
was not up-regulated by tunicamycin. Instead, treatment with
tunicamycin resulted in a marked decrease in CHOP expression.
To clarify a potential role of CHOP in the up-regulation of
TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin, we inhibited CHOP by transiently
transfecting a CHOP siRNA construct into Mel-RM and MM200
cells. Figure 5B shows that siRNA knockdown of CHOP significantly
inhibited its expression in both cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5C, the
CHOP siRNA moderately inhibited the increase in TRAIL-R2 at
16 h after treatment with tunicamycin. However, by 36 h, the
increase in TRAIL-R2 expression in MM200 cells was markedly
reduced with the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) being
approximately the same as that in cells without treatment with

time periods were subjected to Western blot analysis. The data shown are representative of three individual experiments. B, knockdown of IRE1a and ATF6 by
siRNA decreases the levels of expression of IRE1a and ATF6, respectively, in the absence or presence of tunicamycin. Mel-RM and MM200 cells were transfected with

Tunicamycin Sensitizes Melanoma to TRAIL

the effect of tunicamycin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in fresh
melanoma isolates is accounted for by the increase in TRAIL-R2
expression on the cell surface.

Discussion
The present study shows that tunicamycin, a naturally occurring
antibiotic that induces ER stress by inhibition of glycosylation (15),
can potently enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cultured
melanoma cell lines and fresh melanoma isolates by selectively
up-regulating TRAIL-R2 on the cell surface. We show, for the first
time, that the IRE1a- and ATF6-mediated signaling pathways of
the UPR contribute to the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 in a cell
line–dependent manner.
Although TRAIL seems to be a promising candidate for cancer
therapeutics (1–5), our past studies indicated that fresh isolates of
melanoma and melanoma in tissue sections frequently had low
TRAIL death receptor expression and, therefore, may be unresponsive to TRAIL (8, 11). However, unlike studies in many other
solid cancers, in which TRAIL death receptors could be upregulated by other therapeutic drugs (24–27), we have not found
these to increase TRAIL death receptor expression in melanoma.
Agents tested have included DNA-damaging agents, microtubulintargeting agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
inhibitors (ref. 21, and data not shown). The ability of tunicamycin
to up-regulate TRAIL-R2 in melanoma is therefore of particular
interest. Importantly, up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin
seemed to be highly selective. This is because tunicamycin did not
up-regulate the expression of the other TNF receptor family
members, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R3, and TRAIL-R4, TNF-R1 and TNFR2, and Fas. Moreover, tunicamycin did not up-regulate TRAIL-R2
expression in normal cells, including melanocytes, fibroblasts, and
HUVECs. This melanoma-specific selectivity of tunicamycin in the
up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 would be an advantage for its potential
clinical use.
Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin was associated with
enhanced apoptotic signaling induced by TRAIL. This was
evidenced by increased activation of caspase-8 and Bid, reduction
in DCm, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of its substrate
PARP. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 are the major initiator and effector
caspase, respectively, in TRAIL-induced apoptosis of melanoma
cells, whereas Bid is the essential mediator that links the death
receptor apoptotic pathway to the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway (27, 28–30). The latter is known to play an important
role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis of melanoma (7, 31). The finding
that a TRAIL-R2/Fc chimera or a caspase-8–specific inhibitor
efficiently blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the presence of
tunicamycin suggests that enhanced apoptotic signaling was due to
the increased interactions between TRAIL and TRAIL-R2.
Tunicamycin-mediated up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 on the
melanoma cell surface was associated with increased TRAIL-R2
gene transcription and elevated TRAIL-R2 total protein levels.
However, TRAIL-R2 total protein levels experienced a rapid but
transient decrease after exposure to tunicamycin. This may reflect
reduced initiation of translation that is the most immediate
response of the UPR to ER stress (14, 32). Indeed, the translation
initiator eIF2a was phosphorylated by tunicamycin in melanoma
cells. Similarly, a number of the UPR components, including the ER
chaperone protein Bip, the UPR effector XBP1, and the UPR
transducers PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6 were up-regulated/activated

www.aacrjournals.org

by tunicamycin (12–14). These results indicate that the UPR was
activated by tunicamycin in melanoma cells and suggest that the
increase in TRAIL-R2 gene transcription may be the outcome of
selective up-regulation of transcription of UPR target genes.
Both the IRE1a- and ATF6-mediated signaling pathways of the
UPR seemed to play roles in tunicamycin-mediated up-regulation of
TRAIL-R2 in Mel-RM cells as shown by the inhibition of TRAIL-R2
up-regulation when IRE1a or ATF6 was knocked down by siRNA.
IRE1a seemed particularly important in that inhibition IRE1a
markedly inhibited the increase in TRAIL-R2 even at a relatively
early stage (16 h) after treatment with tunicamycin. In contrast, the
inhibitory effect of ATF6 siRNA was only evident at 36 h. Both
IRE1a and ATF6 are ER membrane–localized proteins that act as
UPR transducers (12–14). On activation of the UPR, IRE1a displays
its RNase activity that cleaves XBP1 mRNA, generating a splicing
variant of XBP1 mRNA that encodes a potent transcription factor,
which in turn activates transcription of many UPR target genes.
ATF6 itself is a transcription factor that, on activation, relocates to
Golgi where it is cleaved into the smaller active form that activates
transcription of UPR target genes. It is conceivable that both the
effector of IRE1a, XBP1, and ATF6 may act directly or indirectly
via other transcription factors such as CHOP to activate transcription of TRAIL-R2 in Mel-RM cells (12–14).
It is unclear why IRE1a and ATF6 did not play a role in the upregulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin in MM200 cells. However,
tunicamycin treatment resulted in greater up-regulation of IRE1a
and ATF6 in Mel-RM than in MM200 cells, and XBP1 was just
above the detectable level in MM200 cells. It is therefore likely that
the IRE1a- and ATF6-mediated signaling pathways of the UPR
were less activated by tunicamycin in MM200 cells and, thus, did
not play a role in tunicamycin-mediated up-regulation of TRAILR2. Similarly, phosphorylation of PERK and its substrate eIF2a was
less in MM200 compared with Mel-RM cells. In addition to the
attenuation of translation, in general, the PERK-mediated pathway
of the UPR can cause selective promotion of translation of a small
subset of mRNAs, including the ATF4 mRNA (12–14, 32). The latter
encodes a transcription factor that activates transcription of UPR
target genes including CHOP, which has been shown to be
responsible for the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 induced by
tunicamycin in human prostate cancer cells (17).
A paradox arising from the current study was that CHOP was
constitutively expressed at relatively high levels, but was decreased
by tunicamycin in melanoma cells. Nevertheless, CHOP was
involved in the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 as shown by knockdown
experiments with CHOP siRNA. The TRAIL-R2 promoter is known
to contain a CHOP binding site, which was shown to play a role in
the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 upon the activation of the UPR
(17, 33). In Mel-RM cells, CHOP siRNA but not ATF6 siRNA blocked
tunicamycin-induced up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 at 16 h, suggesting
that CHOP may act independently of ATF6 in these cells. In MM200
cells, inhibition of IRE1a or ATF6 by siRNA did not block the
increase in TRAIL-R2 induced by tunicamycin, suggesting that the
up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by CHOP in these cells was independent
of IRE1a or ATF6. The high expression of CHOP in melanoma may
indicate that the UPR is constitutively activated in melanoma cells
as reported in other cancer cells (34–36). The decrease in CHOP
expression after tunicamycin treatment may be due to the
attenuation of translation during the UPR (33). Further studies
are needed to test this hypothesis.
Our finding that tunicamycin could sensitize fresh melanoma
isolates to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by the up-regulation of

TRAIL-R2 is of particular importance because it is known that fresh
melanoma isolates are relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis due to low levels of TRAIL death receptor expression
(8). This may reflect more closely the in-vivo status of TRAIL death
receptor expression in melanoma cells and their susceptibility to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, although tunicamycin alone
did not induce significant apoptosis in melanoma cells, it induced
varying degrees of apoptosis in normal cells, such as melanocytes,
fibroblasts, and HUVECs. These results suggest that careful
evaluation of low doses of tunicamycin or other ER stress–inducing
agents in combination with low concentrations of TRAIL is

however, to agents which may sensitize melanoma to TRAIL and
