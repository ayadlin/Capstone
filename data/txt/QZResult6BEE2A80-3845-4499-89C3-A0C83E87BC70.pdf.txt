Abstract
Epidemiologic and experimental data have led to increased interest in possible roles of biguanides in
cancer prevention and/or treatment. Prior studies suggest that the primary action of metformin is inhibition
of oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in reduced mitochondrial ATP production and activation of AMPK.
In vitro, this may lead to AMPK-dependent growth inhibition if AMPK and its effector pathways are intact or
to an energetic crisis if these are defective. We now show that the effect of exposure of several transformed
cell lines to metformin varies with carbon source: in the presence of glutamine and absence of glucose, a
75% decrease in cellular ATP and an 80% decrease in cell number is typical; in contrast, when glucose is
present, metformin exposure leads to increased glycolysis, with only a modest reduction in ATP level and
cell number. Overexpression of myc was associated with sensitization to the antiproliferative effects of
metformin, consistent with myc involvement in "glutamine addiction". Our results reveal previously
unrecognized factors that inﬂuence metformin sensitivity and suggest that metformin-induced increase in
glycolysis attenuates the antiproliferative effects of the compound. Cancer Res; 72(23); 6257–67. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Metformin is a partial inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (1, 2). By decreasing
mitochondrial ATP production, metformin activates the
AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis (3). When this pathway
is activated, energy-consuming processes such as protein
synthesis and fatty acid synthesis are downregulated, which
tends to lessen energetic stress but limits anabolic metabolism and proliferation (4–9). In cells with defective AMPK
signaling or effector pathways, metformin exposure decreases
oxidative phosphorylation without a compensatory decrease
in energy expenditure, leading to an energy crisis (10, 11).
Metformin is widely used in the treatment of type II diabetes
(12). In the special case of hepatocytes, energetic stress induced
by the compound leads to downregulation of gluconeogenesis
(13, 14), which represents energy export from the liver as
glucose. This, in turn, reduces the hyperglycemia of type II
diabetes, with secondary reduction in the hyperinsulinemia
seen in this condition (15). These systemic actions may contribute to the antineoplastic effects of metformin seen in some

in vivo models (10, 16). Cell autonomous actions, such as
those described in this paper, may also play critical roles in
antineoplastic actions of biguanides, provided adequate drug
concentrations are achieved in vivo.
Glucose and glutamine are major metabolic substrates for
cancer cells, providing a carbon source for generating ATP.
Glutamine also provides precursors for the synthesis of nucleic
acids, proteins, and lipids by replenishment of the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle intermediates via anaplerosis (17, 18). Oncogenic levels of myc induce a transcriptional program that
increases glutamine consumption and reliance on glutamine
as a bioenergetic substrate (19, 20).
Some pharmacoepidemiologic studies have suggested that
metformin may have antineoplastic activity (21–27) but others
have not supported this view (28–31). Similarly, some (10) but
not all (32) laboratory studies suggest that metformin has
antineoplastic activity. It is possible that these inconsistencies
may result from unrecognized genetic and/or metabolic characteristics of the tumor or the host that determine metformin
sensitivity. Prior work has identiﬁed host insulin levels (10),
LKB1 status (10), and expression of transport molecules for
metformin uptake (33) as candidate predictors of metformin
sensitivity. Here, we examined carbon source and myc expression as candidate predictive markers for antineoplastic activity
of metformin.

Medium (DMEM) without D-glucose, sodium pyruvate, and
L-glutamine were purchased from Wisent. HEPES was purchased from EMD chemicals. Anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448),
anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP; Ser235/236) and antib-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG,
and enhanced chemiluminescene (ECL) reagents were from
Pharmacia-Amersham.
Cell lines and culture conditions
MC38 colon carcinoma, a mouse tumor cell line derived from
a C57BL/6 mouse was generously donated by Dr. Pnina Brodt
(McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). TGR1 rat ﬁbroblasts, isogenic HO15.19 cells with targeted disruption of both
alleles of c-Myc, and HOmyc cells in which c-Myc expression has
been restored in the knockout cells (34) were kindly provided by
Dr. John Sedivy (Brown University, Providence, RI) and maintained with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL
gentamycin at 37 C and 5% CO2. The mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts were generously donated by Dr. Wilson Miller (McGill
University) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and 100 U/mL gentamycin at 37 C and 5% CO2. The cell
line P493-6 (generously donated by Dr. Chi Van Dang (Abraham
Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA)
was established by stable transfection of EREB2-5 cells with
the construct pmyc-tet (35, 36). Cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL gentamycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Wisent). For repression of myc,
0.1 mg/mL tetracycline was added to the culture medium. To
reinduce myc, cells were washed 3 times with tetracycline-free,
prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10%
FBS (37). Uninduced cells (0 hours), which were arrested by
tetracycline for 72 hours, served as a control. The control cells
were washed similarly to the induced cells, except that tetracycline was present in all washing solutions. All experiments
were carried out in the absence of EBNA2 function (without
estrogen; ref. 36).
Cell treatments
Cells were plated in 96-well plate (3,500 cells/well), 12-well
plate (105 cells/well), 6-well plate (3  105 cells/well), or in
10-cm petri dish (1.5  106 cells) for 24 hours. Medium
was changed for fresh medium containing either glucose
or glutamine (20 or 5 mmol/L) or both in the absence or
presence of metformin (5 mmol/L) for another 12, 48, or
72 hours depending on the experiment. After treatment,
supernatant was collected and stored at 80 C until use and
cells were trypsinized and counted (Trypan blue exclusion)
for extraction or colorimetric assays. Other treatments
included increasing concentrations of carbon source with
or without metformin. All experiments were carried out at
least twice and each condition was in triplicates or 4
replicates.
Cell proliferation assay
We used the MTT (Sigma Chemical) assay to determine
the effects of various carbon sources and metformin on
cell growth (cell viability). After appropriate treatment time

(48 hours), MTT was added to a ﬁnal concentration of
1 mg/mL, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 3
hours at 37 C. The resulting crystals were dissolved in 0.04%
HCl in isopropanol and the absorbance was read at 562 nm.
Triplicates were used for each treatment, and each experiment was repeated twice. Cell proliferation in presence of
various concentrations of glucose and glutamine was also
evaluated by 0.4% Trypan blue exclusion cell counting.
Duplicates were used for each condition and the experiment was repeated 3 times (38). A Bromodeoxuridine Assay
Kit (Calbiochem) was also used to assess proliferation. The
kit was used as per the manufacturer's instructions, with
2  105 cells per well.
ATP measurement
Cellular ATP levels were measured using the Invitrogen ATP
Determination Kit A22066, (Invitrogen). Cells were treated in
5% FBS DMEM in the absence or presence metformin and
under various substrate conditions, for 48 hours. The kit was
used as per the manufacturer's instructions with 2  105 cells
per well. Measurements were done in triplicate.
Measurements of glucose consumption
Cells were cultured in complete medium with 10% FBS. After
24 hours, the complete medium was replaced with test medium in the absence or presence of metformin. Cells were
incubated for 48 hours and the culture medium was then
collected and analyzed for measurement of glucose and lactate
concentrations using colorimetric kits according to manufacturer's instructions. Glucose levels were determined using a
Glucose assay kit (Eton Bioscience, Inc.). Results were indexed
to cell-free media and to the number of cells.
Lactate production assay
Lactate levels were determined in 10 mL culture medium
collected from treated cells and results were standardized
with the number of cells. Lactate was calculated using a Lactate
Kit (BioVision, Inc.).
Cellular respiration
Cells were rinsed, trypsinized, and spun twice at 1,200 rpm
for 5 minutes, the ﬁnal pellet was resuspended in DMEM, 5%
dialyzed FBS, 25 mmol/L HEPES with either 20 mmol/L
glucose or glutamine. Oxygen consumption was measured by
a Clarke type electrode (Rank Brothers) using 4  106 cells/mL
at 37 C. Total respiration was assessed without the presence
of any inhibitors. Nonmitochondrial respiration was measured
using myxothiazol (12 mg/1  106 cells) and subtracted from
the baseline respiration rate.
NADþ/NADH quantiﬁcation
Cellular NADþ and NADH levels were measured using the
NADþ/NADH Quantiﬁcation Kit, (BioVision). Cells were
treated in 5% FBS DMEM in the absence or presence of
metformin and under various substrate conditions for 48
hours. The kit was used as per the manufacturer's instructions with 2  105 cells per well. Measurements were done in
triplicate.

Metformin, Carbon Source, and Myc

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and
lysed in 100 to 400 mL lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris HCl
(pH 7.5)], 150 mmol/L NaCL, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L b-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, and Complete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail Tablet from Roche Diagnostic. Cell debris were
removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 minutes
at 4 C. Following the assay for total protein (Bio-Rad),
clariﬁed protein lysates from each experimental condition
(40–50 mg) were boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to
electrophoresis in denaturing 10% SDS-PAGE. Separated
proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and
after blocking, the membranes were probed with antibodies
of interest. In some cases, developed blots were stripped in
stripping buffer [62 mmol/L Tris HCL (pH 6.8), 100 mmol/L
b-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS] to conﬁrm equal protein loading. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and
anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies. The
position of proteins was visualized using the enhanced
chemiluminescene reagent ECL.

vs. inhibition by metformin in glutamine and glucose-containing media, 20%, P ¼ 0.0007).
To conﬁrm these results, which were determined by MTT
assay, we counted Trypan blue excluding MC38 cells (Fig. 1C),
and the same trends were observed (inhibition by meformin
in 20 mmol/L glucose, 12% vs. inhibition by metformin in
20 mmol/L glutamine, 89%, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, similar
effects of metformin were seen with the Trypan blue exclusion
assay when glucose and glutamine were provided at physiologic concentrations (5 mmol/L) rather than those conventionally used in tissue culture media (20 mmol/L; results not
shown). To further conﬁrm and establish the generality of
this observation, mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts were studied
using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and physiologic
glucose and glutamine concentrations (Fig. 1D). Again, metformin was a better growth inhibitor in media with 5 mmol/L
glutamine than media with 5 mmol/L glucose not only in
terms of absolute decrease in viable cells, but also in terms of
percentage growth inhibition relative to control (inhibition
by meformin in glucose containing media, 0% vs. inhibition
by metformin in glutamine-only media, 94%, P < 0.0001).

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SEM. The distribution of
variables was tested for normality. The signiﬁcance of differences between paired or unpaired sets of values was assessed
using GLM or Mixed Procedures. Two-way and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the effects of
different variables. In addition, Least-squares means post hoc
for multiple unpaired comparisons of means (LSMEANS statement with Bonferroni correction) was applied. All statistical
analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis System
software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute), with P values < 0.05 considered signiﬁcant.

Results and Discussion

Effect of metformin on mTOR signaling as a function of
carbon source
Our previous ﬁndings showed that in vitro, metformin, like
rapamycin, decreases mTOR phosphorylation and prevents
phosphorylation of S6K1 (8, 10, 39), consistent with the previously described role of AMPK activation as an inhibitor of
mTOR (7). In our MC38 cell experimental system, glutamine
availability was associated with increased mTOR activation,
as expected (40). While metformin attenuated mTOR activity
when cells were grown in glucose alone or both nutrients to
a slight degree, it drastically repressed mTOR activity when
cells were grown in glutamine. Similarly, metformin inhibited
phosphorylation of S6RP, a downstream effector of mTOR, in
cells provided with glutamine, as shown in Fig. 2.

Carbon source inﬂuences the antiproliferative effect of
metformin
We measured proliferation of MC38 colon carcinoma cells
grown in increasing concentrations of glucose, glutamine, or
both glucose and glutamine. Proliferation was considerably
higher when media contained glutamine as compared to
growth under the glucose-only condition (proliferation in
20 mmol/L glutamine, 0.71  0.04 arbitrary units (AU) vs.
proliferation in 20 mmol/L glucose, 0.22  0.08 AU, P < 0.0001;
ref. Fig. 1A). Following 48-hour exposure, we observed that
metformin (5 mmol/L) had no signiﬁcant inhibitory activity for
cells growing in glucose, but inhibited cells using glutamine as
a carbon source (inhibition by meformin in glucose containing
media, 7% vs. inhibition by metformin in glutamine-only
media, 78%, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B). Furthermore, increasing
concentrations of glutamine in the absence of glucose did
not diminish the inhibitory effects of metformin, as shown
in Fig. 1B. When both glucose and glutamine were present, the
inhibitory activity of metformin was intermediate between
the glucose-only and glutamine-only conditions, but increasing glucose concentrations did attenuate the metformin effect
(inhibition by meformin in glutamine containing media, 78%

Effect of metformin on ATP level, glucose consumption,
lactate production, and NADþ/NADH ratio as a function
of carbon source
Having established that metformin is a more effective
growth inhibitor when MC38 cells use glutamine rather than
glucose as a fuel, we examined additional metabolic end
points. Figure 3A shows a signiﬁcant drop (75%) in ATP
level when cells in glutamine-only media were exposed to
metformin, whereas a metformin-induced decrease in ATP
level was not observed when glucose was available. As metformin inhibits mitochondrial ATP production (2), this is in
keeping with the fact that the use of glutamine to generate
ATP is more dependent on functional mitochondria than
the use of glucose, because glucose can provide ATP via
glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, but generation of
ATP from glutamine requires the TCA cycle and oxidative
phosphorylation.
Glucose consumption (P < 0.0001) and lactate production
increased (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B and C) when MC38 cells with
access to glucose were exposed to metformin in the presence
or absence of glutamine. This is consistent with a decrease in

metformin, indicating that in these cells glutamine is not
converted into pyruvate and then to malate to produce
lactate.
When both glutamine and glucose are present, lactate
production is substantially less than in the glucose-only
condition. This is observed in both the presence or absence
of metformin (lactate production in media with both glucose
and glutamine, 10.08  0.08 nmol/106 cells/48 hours vs.
glucose-only media, 39.24  2.78 nmol/106 cells/48 hours,

vs. glucose-only media in the presence of metformin, 56.96 
0.61 nmol/106 cells/48 hours, P ¼ 0.0005). This provides
further evidence that glutamine availability leads to reduced
glycolysis.
A metformin-induced decline in the NADþ/NADH ratio was
only observed in the absence of glucose (41.06% decline in
NADþ/NADH ratio in the glutamine-only condition, P ¼
0.0045 vs. a 0% decline in conditions where glucose was
available; Fig. 3D). This is in keeping with the inhibition of
complex I by metformin, with accumulation of NADH. This
effect of metformin is attenuated in the presence of glucose;
under these conditions, increased lactic acid production by
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) consumes NADH but further
analysis will be of interest as the increased glycolysis induced
by metformin would also be expected to increase NADH
generation by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In
the absence of glucose, no lactic acid is produced, indicating
minimal reductive metabolism of pyruvate to lactate by LDH,
with reduced generation of NADþ.

myc overexpression leads to sensitization to
metformin
In the context of prior evidence that glutamine uptake
and metabolism are increased by myc (41) and our observation that glutamine use sensitizes cells to metformin, we
examined the inﬂuence of myc on metformin action. We
used TGR-1 Rat1 ﬁbroblasts expressing physiologic levels of
myc (designated Myc þ/þ), the isogenic myc null HO15.19
cell line (designated Myc /), and the isogenic HOmyc
cell line, which overexpressed myc (designated Myc þþþ).
The highest proliferation was seen in the Myc þþþ cell
line using glutamine as a carbon source, consistent with
evidence that oncogenic levels of myc lead to glutamine
addiction (ref. 40; Fig. 4A).
We observed that as myc levels decrease, proliferation when
glutamine was the carbon source also declined (Myc þþþ,
1.50  106 vs. Myc þ/þ, 0.97  106, P ¼ 0.0049), whereas myc
level had no effect on proliferation when glucose was the
carbon source. While myc has been reported to increase glycolysis and LDH expression (42) as well as glutamine use (40),
this observation suggests that functionally, the effect of myc
on glutamine use is dominant.
To better understand the relation between myc expression
and metformin inhibition, a more physiologic replete media
consisting of 5 mmol/L glucose and 5 mmol/L glutamine was
used and myc expression was varied (Fig. 4B). BrdUrd incorporation measurements revealed that even in media where
both glucose and glutamine are available, metformin reduced
proliferation to the greatest degree when myc was overexpressed (% inhibition for Myc þþþ cells, 62%, P < 0.0001,%

Figure 3. Effect of metformin on ATP level, glucose consumption, lactate production, and NADþ/NADH ratio as a function of carbon source. MC38 colon
cancer cells were cultured in 20 mmol/L glucose, 20 mmol/L glutamine, or both in the presence or absence of metformin (5 mmol/L) for 48 hours. A, ATP
levels. Exposure to metformin (5 mmol/L) resulted in a decrease (75%) in ATP level in the glutamine-only condition, whereas this decline in ATP level
was not observed in the glucose-only condition. B, glucose consumption. Metformin exposure also led to an increase in glucose consumption
consistent with an increase in glycolysis. Less glucose was consumed when cells were exposed to both nutrients in the presence or absence of
metformin (P < 0.0001). C, lactate production. Metformin exposure resulted in an increase in lactate production when cells were either grown on glucose
or both nutrients (P < 0.0001). Lactate was not detected when cells were exposed to glutamine either in the presence or absence of metformin.
D, NADþ/NADH ratios. Metformin exposure resulted in a 41.06% decrease (P ¼ 0.0045) in NADþ/NADH ratio. This decline was not observed in

inhibition for Myc þ/þ cells, 14% P ¼ NS). The fact that
metformin decreased proliferation in myc-overexpressing
cells growing in replete media and glutamine-only media, but
not in the glucose-only media, suggests that when myc is
overexpressed, the inhibitory effects of metformin are related
to glutamine metabolism.
Effect of metformin on glucose consumption and lactate
production as a function of carbon source and myc
expression
Previous reports have shown that c-myc upregulates the
expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), phosphofructokinase, and enolase A as well as directly regulating LDH-A
(35, 37, 43, 44). We therefore carried out experiments to
determine if varying myc expression inﬂuences the effects
of metformin on glucose consumption and lactate production. Figure 5A shows that metformin increases glucose
consumption when cells were grown in media without glutamine, and that the amount of glucose consumed on metformin
exposure varied signiﬁcantly with myc expression level (glu-

cose consumed in glucose-only media on metformin exposure
for Myc þþþ cells, 27.43 mmol/L/106 cells/48 hours vs. for
Myc þ/þ cells, 10.54 mmol/L/106 cells/48 hours vs. for Myc
/ cells, 2.67 mmol/L/106 cells/48 hours; P < 0.0001 for all
comparisons). myc expression was associated with both higher
fold increase in glucose consumption (3-fold) and higher
absolute glucose consumption levels on metformin exposure
(1.5-fold). Similar trends were seen in the amount of lactate
produced (Fig. 5B). The high amount of lactate released in
conditions where glucose was the only carbon source available
indicates that a considerable amount of pyruvate generated
from glucose through glycolysis does not support oxidative
phosphorylation but is instead reduced to lactate.
In cell lines expressing myc, in the presence of both glucose
and glutamine, the increase in glucose consumption on metformin exposure was not as marked as in the absence of
glutamine (% increase in glucose consumed on metformin
exposure in glucose and glutamine, 69% vs. glucose-only,
300%) in keeping with some residual glutamine use for ATP
production despite the presence of metformin.

Effect of metformin on ATP level and oxygen
consumption as a function of carbon source and myc
expression
We observed higher baseline ATP concentrations when
MC38 cells were grown on glutamine as compared with
glucose, independent of myc status (3-fold higher in glutamine compared with glucose in Myc þþþ and 2.25-fold higher
in Myc /; Fig. 6A). As discussed previously, a substantial
amount of lactate is released from cells when glucose is the
only carbon source (Fig. 5B). Thus, much of the pyruvate
generated from glucose by glycolysis does not contribute to
energy generated by oxidative phosphorylation. However,
when cells are provided with only glutamine, no lactate is
produced and glutamine carbon is all available for oxidative
phosphorylation, explaining the high amounts of ATP and
oxygen consumption (see below) generated in this condition.
Previous reports have showed that biguanides reduce
mitochondrial ATP production (1, 2). Following 48 hours
metformin exposure (5 mmol/L), we observed a substantial
decrease (95%) in cellular ATP levels when cells were grown
in glutamine-only media (20 mmol/L), regardless of myc
expression, as shown in Fig. 6A. In contrast, little decrease in
ATP level was detected when cells were grown on glucose-only
media (20 mmol/L), 25% decrease in Myc þþþ cells and no
decrease in Myc / cells. These results suggest that increased
ATP production via glycolysis represents a mechanism that
partially compensates for the metformin-associated decrease

in ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation, and that
this mechanism operates when cells have access to glucose.
To better understand the relevance of carbon source to
oxidative phosphorylation as a function of myc status and
metformin exposure, oxygen consumption was measured as
myc status and carbon source were varied in the presence or
absence of metformin. Figure 6B shows that the basal level of
oxygen consumption was consistently higher when cells were
using glutamine rather than glucose as a carbon source
provided myc was expressed (Myc / cells, 1.3-fold P ¼ NS;
Myc þ/þ cells, 1.8-fold P ¼ 0.0097; Myc þþþ cells, 1.8-fold P ¼
0.0011). The observation that lactate was not released when
cells were grown on glutamine, yet oxygen consumption and
ATP levels remained high, suggests that when glutamine is the
only carbon source provided, cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation to supply their energy needs. When cells were grown in
glucose-only media, metformin decreased oxygen consumption (P < 0.0001) but this had minimal effect on ATP levels,
in keeping with a high contribution of glycolysis to ATP
generation. This is also in keeping with the metformin induced
increase in glucose consumption and lactate production
under these conditions. Cells in glutamine-only media also
displayed decreased oxygen consumption on metformin
exposure, in keeping with an important decrease in ATP
production by oxidative phosphorylation, but in this case
an increase in glycolysis is not possible and a major decline
in ATP is observed. This supports the hypothesis that ATP

provided by glycolysis protects against metformin-induced
energy stress, consistent with a prior report showing enhanced
ATP depletion when metformin was combined with 2-deoxyglucose, a glycolysis inhibitor (45). The lowest oxygen consumption was observed in cells that had glucose available
for glycolysis, and overexpressed myc, with metformin exposure. This is plausible as these conditions favor maximal
glycolysis.
Metformin sensitization in a tetracycline repressible myc
expression model
Finally, to further investigate the relationship between myc
expression and the antiproliferative effect of metformin, we
used the cell line P493-6 carrying a conditional, tetracyclineregulated myc (36). Figure 7 shows that in the presence of
both glucose and glutamine at physiologic concentrations
(5 mmol/L), the cells overexpressing the myc oncogene (tetra-

cycline absent) were signiﬁcantly inhibited by metformin (37%
inhibition, P ¼ 0.02), whereas cells with low levels of myc
(tetracycline present) were not affected, consistent with our
prior observation that high levels of myc expression sensitize
cells to metformin inhibition.
There is increasing interest in developing cancer therapies
that target energy metabolism as compared with current
drugs that target signal transduction or function as cytotoxic
agents. Many strategies have been proposed (46) and metformin, widely used in treatment of diabetes, as well as other
biguanides, deserve investigation in this context (9). There
may be speciﬁc situations where metformin-induced decline
in circulating insulin level leads to antineoplastic effects, but
this may be restricted to patients who are hyperinsulinemic
at baseline, as small variations of insulin levels within the
normal range are of uncertain biologic signiﬁcance. The present study provides novel information concerning separate

ther increase the substantial rates of glycolysis and lactate
production in cancer cells, but inhibit their proliferation. Our
data suggest that the increase in glycolysis represents compensation to the metformin-induced decrease in oxidative
phosphorylation. This attenuates but does not eliminate metformin-induced energy stress. It is of interest to contrast the
metabolic effects of metformin to those recently described
with PTEN overexpression. PTEN elevation decreased glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in
reduced cell proliferation (47), whereas metformin increases
glycolysis and reduces oxidative phosphorylation but also
leads to a decline in proliferation.
Oxidation of glutamine carbon in the mitochondria is a
major source of energy for proliferating cells (48, 49). Our
ﬁndings, using various experimental systems, show that overexpression of myc, previously shown to be associated with
increased glutamine use (40), increases sensitivity to metformin. This ﬁnding identiﬁes myc overexpressing tumors as
particularly attractive targets for biguanides such as metformin, either alone or in combination with pharmacologic
strategies to inhibit glycolysis.
The use of drugs that induce energy stress in the treatment of those cancers that have genetic alterations that
decrease tolerance to such stress is an attractive therapeutic
concept. However, careful attention needs to be given to
