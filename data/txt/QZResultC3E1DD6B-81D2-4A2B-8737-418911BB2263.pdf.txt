ABSTRACT
Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 immunologic checkpoint with monoclonal antibodies
has provided unprecedented results in cancer treatment in the recent years.
Development of chemical inhibitors for this pathway lags the antibody development
because of insufficient structural information. The first nonpeptidic chemical inhibitors
that target the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have only been recently disclosed by BristolMyers Squibb. Here, we show that these small-molecule compounds bind directly to
PD-L1 and that they potently block PD-1 binding. Structural studies reveal a dimeric
protein complex with a single small molecule which stabilizes the dimer thus occluding
the PD-1 interaction surface of PD-L1s. The small-molecule interaction “hot spots” on
PD-L1 surfaces suggest approaches for the PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist drug discovery.

INTRODUCTION

the combined anti-cancer treatment in 2011 [3]. Even
more encouraging results were more recently obtained
for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, antibodies targeting
the programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1)
immune checkpoint. The tumor responses in clinical
trials in melanoma were impressive enough to merit
the accelerated approval of these antibodies in 2014
[2] [6-7] [http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/­Newsroom/
PressAnnouncements/ucm436534.htm]. Moreover, in
2015, after demonstrating unprecedented results in clinical
trial in the metastatic squamous NSCLC, nivolumab has
gained FDA acceptance in this indication, becoming the
first monotherapy in more than 15 years to demonstrate
proven superior overall survival compared to the standard
of care [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/
ApprovedDrugs/ucm436566.htm]. Numerous further
clinical trials are currently in progress [8].
Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is also feasible
by targeting PD-L1. Objective responses were observed
in melanoma, NSCLC and certain other solid tumors in

Cancer cells avoid immune surveillance by
overexpressing negative immunologic regulators. In
normal conditions these regulators provide checkpoints
that restrain the immune system against targeting selfantigens. However, when overproduced by cancer cells,
they protect those cells against hosts’ immune system.
Even more, such interactions result in the exhaustion (loss
of function) of the antigen-specific effector T-cells. The
immunosuppressive environment created in these ways
permits the cancer cells to proliferate unrestrained. The
reversal of these effects by blocking the interaction of the
negative immunologic regulators on cancer cells, or by
blocking their receptors on immune effector cells, should
in principle help to eliminate cancer [recent reviews:
1-5]. Indeed, the proof-of-concept was established
with the hope-rising results of clinical trials evaluating
ipilimumab, an antibody blocking the immune checkpoint
receptor CTLA-4, resulting in the FDA acceptance for

the phase I clinical trial evaluating monoclonal antibody
BMS-936559 (MDX1105) [9]. Similar encouraging
results were obtained with MEDI4736 antibody in
NSCLC patients [10]. The third anti-PD-L1 antibody
currently evaluated in clinics, MPDL3280A, demonstrated
positive results in melanoma, NSCLC and genitourinary
cancers [11]. It was also granted an FDA breakthrough
designation for the metastatic urothelial bladder cancer
after demonstrating impressive results in the phase I trial
in which tumor shrinkage was observed in 43% of patients
[12]. Additional phase I and phase II trials of anti-PD-L1
antibodies are currently in progress [8].
Ongoing trials evaluating the PD-1 and PD-L1
targeting antibodies in multiple indications in cancer
portend further rapid development. Moreover, initial
results demonstrate association between PD-L1 status and
the response to the treatment [13]. A reliable biomarker
would likely result in further improvement in observed
response rates by rational patient selection. Overall, it is
currently expected that antibodies targeting immunologic
regulators will soon become a significant aspect of the
therapy within a variety of malignancies [8].
This impressive clinical development of the
antibodies that interfere with the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
is in contrast to the development of small-molecule
modulators for this interaction. Several low-molecular
weight immunomodulators targeting the PD-1/PDL1 signaling pathway were reported. These are based
on peptidomimetics [14-15] and macrocyclic peptides
[16]. More recently, in 2015, the 1,2,4-oxadiazole- and
1,2,4-thiadiazole-based inhibitors that contain an extensive
peptidic component have been proposed to suppress and/
or inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, although no
data supporting that action has been provided [17]. We
have tested several of the described peptidomimetic agents
and could show no direct binding to the target PD proteins,
suggesting that possibly other targets are involved. BristolMyers Squibb has recently disclosed the first entirely
nonpeptidic molecules which are claimed to be “useful as
inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 protein/protein interaction”,
although no detailed information was provided [18].
Clearly, progress of small molecule modulators of
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is lagging behind that of antibodies,
which is partially related to insufficient structural
information to guide rational design and development.
The structure of the complex of the murine PD-1 and
human PD-L1 revealed the overall binding mode for the
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction [19], but relatively low sequence
identity of human and murine orthologues limited the
relevance of this finding for drug design. The structures of
human PD-1 (PDB 3RRQ) and human PD-L1 (PDB 3BIS,
3FN3, 4Z18, 5C3T) have been determined, but those in
turn did not account for significant plasticity within the
human PD-1 upon complex formation demonstrated only
very recently by our structure of the fully human PD-1/
PD-L1 complex [20]. Although the above structures
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

provided a complete description of the interaction, the flat
surface of the protein-protein interface still complicates
drug design efforts in the absence of structural information
on the small-molecule inhibitors in complex with either
PD-1 or PD-L1 to guide further rational drug development.
Herein, we report characterization of the interaction
of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) compounds with the target
protein. We show that they act by directly binding to PDL1 and not PD-1 and effectively dissociate a preformed
PD-1/PD-L1 complex in vitro. We further show that they
inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by inducing PD-L1
dimerization through PD-1 interacting surface. We provide
the first crystal structures of a small-molecule inhibitors
bound to its target PD protein, in this case the PD-L1
dimer. Together with our biochemical data, the provided
insight into this protein-inhibitor interaction and detailed
definition of the binding site “hot spots” should facilitate
more dynamic progress in the development of the PD-1/
PD-L1 immune checkpoint modulators.

RESULTS
BMS-8 and BMS-202 bind to PD-L1 and
dissociate the human PD-1/PD-L1 complex in
NMR assays
The small-molecule PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors of
Bristol-Myers Squibb are based on the (2-methyl3-biphenylyl)methanol scaffold [18]. In the original
disclosure, the inhibition of the formation of PD-L1/
PD-1 protein/protein complex was demonstrated in a
homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay,
but mechanistic or structural features, including the actual
target protein, were not disclosed. We have synthesized
and tested four examples of their compounds with the
reported inhibition IC50 towards the PD-L1/PD-1 complex
in the range of 18 to 200 nM, the lowest IC50 values in the
series of about 200 compounds. The compounds that we
have studied are 8, 37, 202 and 242 in the patent, and these
are designated herein as BMS-8, BMS-37, BMS-202 and
BMS-242, respectively (Figure 1).
To unambiguously validate if these compounds bind
to PD-1 or PD-L1, we used NMR, a method that monitors
the direct binding of a small molecule to its target
protein [21-22]. We performed binary titrations, using
the “SAR-by-NMR” approach [21]. The method relies
on monitoring chemical shift perturbations in 2D 1H-15N
HMQC spectra of 15N-labeled proteins upon interaction
with tested ligands. The 15N labeled PD-L1 was titrated
with increasing amount of tested compound while the
1
H-15N signals were monitored using 2D HMQC NMR
experiment. Significant shifts in the correlation NMR
signals of PD-L1 upon addition of each tested compound
documented their direct binding to PD-L1 (Figure S1 and
30324

Oncotarget

S2). No significant shifts were observed upon titration
of the 15N labeled PD-1 with the tested compounds,
demonstrating their specificity for binding to PD-L1 (data
not shown).
The capability of BMS-202 to block the PD-1/PDL1 interaction was evaluated in the NMR based AIDA
assay. The assay monitors broadening of resonance
signals upon protein-protein complex formation related to
increased relaxation time of the higher molecular weight
entities [23-25]. To this end the 15N labeled PD-1 was
first titrated with the non-labeled PD-L1 until no further
changes in the linewidth of the 1H-15N resonance peaks
was observed as monitored by HMQC (Figure S3). In such
conditions the sample contained slight excess of PD-L1
over PD-1. The molecules formed a tight complex which
molecular weight was estimated at around 30 kDa based
on the relaxation time analysis. This corresponds well
with the calculated mass of a 1:1 complex (27.5 kDa).
Upon titration of this preformed complex with BMS-202
narrowing of 1H-15N signals was observed which provides
direct evidence of the complex dissociation.

of BMS-8 and BMS-202 towards PD-L1 and PD-L2
using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) [26].
DSF monitors thermal unfolding of the protein in the
presence of a fluorescent dye sensitive to the changes in
hydrophobicity (protein denaturation). Binding of smallmolecule ligands induces thermal stabilization of the target
protein which is proportional to compound affinity [27].
PD-L1 exhibited a relatively low melting temperature (Tm)
of 35.4oC (Figure S4A). BMS-8 stabilized the thermally
induced unfolding of PD-L1 by 9.4oC (Tm=44.8oC),
whereas BMS-202 by 13oC (Tm=48.4oC). PD-L2 was
characterized by a comparable melting temperature as
PD-L1 (38.2oC), however, neither BMS-8 nor BMS-202
significantly affected the Tm value (38.6oC and 35.6oC,
for BMS-8 and BMS-202, respectively) (Figure S4B).
These results further confirm the interaction of both tested
compounds with hPD-L1 and indicate that BMS-8 exhibits
lower affinity compared to BMS-202. Furthermore,
the presented data suggests that both compounds bind
specifically only to PD-L1, but not PD-L2.

complex with the target protein. The obtained crystals
diffracted to the 2.2 Å resolution (Table 1). Four protein
molecules found in the asymmetric unit are organized
into two dimers with one inhibitor molecule located at
the interface of each dimer (i.e. the stoichiometry of the
BMS-202 : PD-L1 in the complex is 1: 2, respectively)
(Figure 2A). No additional inhibitor molecules were found
within the structure. The protein dimer exhibits a pseudo
2-fold rotational symmetry around an axis parallel to the
long axis of the PD-L1 molecule. The inhibitor is located
roughly perpendicular to the dimer pseudo-symmetry
axis and its disposition does not follow the symmetry

of the dimer (Figure 2A). Both the binding site of the
inhibitor and the intermolecular interactions within the
dimer involve the PD-1 interaction surface of PD-L1,
providing a rationale of the mechanism of action of BMS202 (ie. dimerization related occlusion of PD-1 interaction
surface).
Both inhibitor molecules are well defined by the
electron density allowing unambiguous positioning of
all moieties (Figure S5). The inhibitor inserts deep into a
cylindrical, hydrophobic pocket created at the interface of
two monomers within the dimer (Figure 3 and Figure S6).

and restricted by the sidechain of ATyr56 on the opposite
side (the protein molecules are annotated by subscripts
A, B, C and D according to the chain arrangement in the
crystal structure; the inhibitor disposition is described here
based on AB dimer and is similar in CD dimer unless noted
otherwise). The 2-methylbiphenyl core of the inhibitor
anchors at the very bottom of the pocket (Figure 2B and
Figure S7). The distal phenyl ring within the biphenyl
creates a T-stacking interaction with the sidechain of
Tyr56 and is further stabilized by π-alkyl interactions with
A
the sidechains of AMet115 and BAla121. The orientation of
central methyl-phenyl ring is roughly related to that of the
distal ring by a pseudo glide plane through ring connecting
bond and roughly 45° to the ring planes. The major
interactions of the central ring involve the hydrophobic
interactions with AAla121 and BMet115. The methyl of this
ring provides additional interactions in a pocket formed
by AMet115, AAla121 and ATyr123 (Figure 2B and Figure
S7). Moreover the methyl group serves to turn the two

phenyl groups out of coplanarity to preorganize the ligand
binding conformation. The methoxy-pyridine moiety
provides a significant contribution to the compound
binding including π-π stacking with the ring of BTyr56
and a number of polar interactions with the A monomer
including the carbonyl-π interaction with the backbone
of AAla121, the anion-π interaction with the sidechain of
Asp122, a water-mediated lone-pair-π interaction with the
A
backbone of APhe19 and the water-mediated interactions
of the methoxyl group with the sidechains of AAsp122
and ALys124 and the backbone carbonyl of ATyr123.
The extended N-(2-aminoethyl)acetamide moiety of the
inhibitor provides additional electrostatic interactions, but
only with the A monomer (and corresponding C monomer
for the second inhibitor molecule contained in the
asymmetric unit). A water-mediated interaction with the
backbone carbonyl of APhe19 is observed for both inhibitor
molecules contained in the asymmetric unit, but further
interactions of the distal parts of the acetamide group

differ between the monomers. This is unrelated to crystal
packing since no symmetry related molecules locate near
the described moiety, but rather seems an effect of its
flexibility (evidenced by high temperature factors, Figure
S8C) and a solvent-exposed character of the binding site
in this region (the described inhibitor moiety interacts
with surface residues rather than within a defined pocket;
Figure 2B, Figure 3). In one of the dimers (AB) contained
in the asymmetric unit the acetamide moiety contributes
a hydrogen bond to the sidechain of ALys124 whereas in
the second dimer (CD) with that of CThr20. Overall, the
inhibitor-protein interaction is best described as bimodal,
spatially divided into hydrophobic and electrostatic parts
following the inhibitor bimodal design.

allowed unambiguous positioning of the inhibitor and all
the interacting residues. The asymmetric unit contains
two molecules of PD-L1 organized in a dimer identical
to that observed in the structure of PD-L1/BMS-202. A
single molecule of BMS-8 binds at the interface of the
dimer in a pocket almost identical to that found in PDL1/BMS-202 complex (Figure S8B). The disposition of
the buried part of BMS-8 is identical to that observed for
BMS-202 and the only differences are observed in the part
directed towards the solvent (Figure S8A). Overall, the
binding mode of the compound and geometry of PD-L1
dimer are identical in the structures containing BMS-8
and BMS-202 save for detailed interactions of the solvent
directed moieties. The fact that crystals of PD-L1/BMS-8
complex were obtained in different conditions and belong
to a different space group than those of PD-L1/BMS-202
strongly advocates that PD-L1 dimerization reflects a
specific mechanism of action of BMS compounds rather
than a crystallization artifact.

Crystal structure of PD-L1/BMS-8 complex

The crystal structure of PD-L1/BMS-202 complex
suggests that BMS-202 induces dimerization of PD-L1.
To assess if the observed dimerization is induced by

PD-L1 (Table 1). The crystal structure was solved at 2.3

action, we checked whether BMS-202 and BMS-8 induce
the PD-L1 dimerization in solution. To this end PD-L1
was characterized by size exclusion chromatography
in the presence and absence of tested compounds. ApoPD-L1 yielded a single peak corresponding to a protein
of molecular weight of 17 kDa, suggesting a monomeric
state of the apoprotein in solution. In the presence of
each compound the peak shifted to shorter retention time
corresponding to a protein of around 34 kDa, consistent
with a calculated molecular weight of a dimer (Figure S9).
This indicates the PD-L1 dimerization by both BMS-202
and BMS-8 in solution.
To further evaluate the presumed BMS compound
induced PD-L1 dimerization in solution, we titrated PDL1 with BMS-202, BMS-8, BMS-37 and BMS-242 while
monitoring the 1H resonance linewidth by NMR. In all
the cases, the well resolved narrow resonance peaks in
the aliphatic region of 1H NMR spectrum of apo-PD-L1
exhibited significant broadening upon addition of each

compound indicating significant increase in the molecular
weight of the complex (Figure S1B and S2). The molecular
weight of each complex estimated from relaxation time
analysis was around 30 kDa, which can only be explained
by the compound induced PD-L1 dimerization. Similar
resonance linewidth broadening was observed in the
1
H-15N HMQC spectra when the 15N-labeled PD-L1 was
titrated with BMS-202 (Figure S1A).
Overall, the NMR titration experiments support
the results obtained in gel filtration indicating that all
tested BMS compounds induce dimerization of PD-L1 in
solution and that such preformed dimeric state is reflected
by the crystal structures provided in this study.
Multiple hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions
stabilize the homodimer (Figure 2B and Figure S8B).
The interactions are discussed based on PD-L1/
BMS-202 structure, but are similar in PD-L1/BMS8 structure. The hydroxyl group of ATyr56 creates a 2.6
Å-long hydrogen bond and hydrophobic contacts with

(blue ribbon- model A, green surface – model B) was superposed with PD-L1 molecule (not shown) within PD-1/PD-L1 complex (PD-1
shown as red ribbon). Model B within PD-L1 dimer and PD-1 do not overlay perfectly (are shifted by around 10Å), but BMS-202 induced
dimerization of PD-L1 masks almost the entire PD-1 interaction surface thereby preventing PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Same is true for

Asp122 (graphical representation of the interactions is
presented in Figure S10 [28]). BAla121 creates a net of
hydrophobic interactions with ATyr56 and AIle54, which
at the same time interacts with BGly120 also utilizing
hydrophobic interactions. Ser117 in the APD-L1 and
PD-L1 molecules participate in the 2.9 Å hydrogen bond
B
and in the hydrophobic contacts, as the Ser117 residues
are located parallel to each other. Next, ATyr123 joins with
both BMet115 and BGlu58 using hydrophobic contacts
and hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl of BGlu58 and
hydroxyl of tyrosine. AArg113 builds a dense interaction
network consisting of a salt bridge, hydrogen bonding
and hydrophobic interactions with BGlu58 and BAsp61
and hydrophobic contacts with BGlu60 and BArg113 as
well. BArg113 residue also contributes a salt bridge and
hydrogen bonding with AAsp61 which creates next salt
bridge with BArg125. BTyr123 interacts with AGlu58 and
Met115 through hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen
A
bonds.

within this study promise dynamic progress in the field in
the near future.
Several low-molecular weight immunomodulators
targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway that are based on
peptidomimetics [14-15] and macrocyclic peptides [16]
were reported. We have tested several of the described
peptidomimetics. The results obtained by us did not
indicate binding to either of the PD proteins suggesting
that these compounds modulate the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
only indirectly (data not shown).
The first group of true small-molecule inhibitors
of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction was described by BristolMyers Squibb. The BMS inhibitors are derivatives of
(2-methyl-3-biphenylyl)methanol. The capability to block
the PD-1/PD-L1 complex formation was demonstrated in
the HTRF assay in the original disclosure, but no further
confirmatory data or structural information was provided
to date. Among their most potent examples, BMS-8 and
-202 inhibited the formation of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex
with the IC50 values of 0.146 and 0.018 µM, respectively.
Despite the fact that these compounds have poor druglike properties and as such are unlikely to become lead
structures, they serve well as a proof of principle that
targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction surface is feasible
not only with antibodies, but also with small molecules.
Therefore we attempted their detailed characterization in
this study. Most importantly, we wished to characterize the
hot spots and key interactions at the surface of the target
molecule to guide future rational design of more drug-like
inhibitors.
We demonstrated that BMS compounds bind to PDL1 and not PD-1 and presented direct confirmation by
NMR that in vitro BMS-8 and BMS-202 are capable of

DISCUSSION
Monoclonal antibodies targeting immunologic
checkpoints and especially the PD-1/PD-L1 axis provided
spectacular results in cancer therapy in the recent years
[recent reviews: 1-4]. Given the large number of ongoing
clinical trials this success will likely expand in the near
future. Development of small molecule inhibitors of
PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint is currently much behind that
of the antibodies, but first tool compounds have already
been disclosed. The number of announced commercial
programs within this novel segment of immunomodulatory
molecules and the detailed structural insight provided

upon PD-1 binding (Note the T-stacking interaction of Tyr56 with the distal phenyl moiety of the inhibitor. Similar for BMS-8 containing

Ala121 and Tyr123 forming an extended groove ideal
for accommodating hydrophobic moieties (Figure S6).
Presented herein new composite binding cleft does not
exclude possible use of the previously described single
“hot spots”, thereby creating novel possibilities for further
inhibitor design.
Interestingly, the inhibitor binding induces a small,
but significant rearrangement of the sidechains at the
surface of PD-L1 (compared to the apo-structure), which
is partly different to that induced by the PD-1 interaction.
In the case of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex, Tyr56 of PD-L1
is rotated and rearranged towards the PD-L1 core, while
the Tyr56 sidechain ring in PD-L1/BMS-202 complex is
considerably moved towards the inhibitor molecule thus
creating a T-stacking interaction with the benzyl moiety
of the latter (Figure 5). Similar rearrangement is observed
upon BMS-8 binding. This dynamic adjustment in PDL1 upon inhibitor binding provides further guidance for
the rational design of small-molecule binders to PD-L1.
Additionally, less pronounced adjustments include Ala18,
Thr20, Met115, Ser117 and Tyr123 residues in the close
vicinity of the inhibitor. Even though the compound does
not impose significant changes in the overall backbone
arrangement, minor rearrangements are visible in residues
distant to the inhibitor binding site including Pro24,
Asp61, His69, Glu71, Tyr81 and Arg113. These changes,
however, are most likely caused by the dimerization rather
than the small-molecule binding.
This study was performed using soluble distal
extracellular IgG like domain of PD-L1 which served
well to characterize protein surface accessible for targeting
with small molecule inhibitors. At the cell surface,
however, PD-L1 is constrained by being anchored at
the lipid bilayer. Overlay of the structure of full length
extracellular domain of PD-L1 containing both IgG like
domains on BMS-202 induced dimer and docking such
a complex at the lipid membrane demonstrates that
dimerization is sterically feasible at the cell surface (same
is true for BMS-8 containing dimer). This is owned to a
long spacer between the membrane and a relatively rigid
“core” of the extracellular domain of PD-L1, which linker
allows enough flexibility for the core to form a dimer
characterized by geometry observed in our structures
(Figure S11A).
The proteins used in this study were produced in
bacteria and as such lack glycosylation. We therefore
evaluated if mammalian glycosylation could preclude
BMS compound induced PD-L1 dimerization. The known
glycosylation sites on PD-L1 are shown in Figure S11B
and clearly do not sterically interfere with BMS-202
induced dimerization. This was expected since PD-L1
employs the same surface for dimerization and interaction
with PD-1. Any glycosylation preventing dimerization
would also preclude PD-1 binding.
Differential scanning fluorimetry employed here to
evaluate the BMS compound selectivity between PD-L1

dissociating the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction at stoichiometric
concentration, consistent with the estimated KD of the
PD-1/PD-L1 complex of 8 µM [29]. Quite unexpectedly,
however, the compounds induced dimerization of hPD-L1
in solution.
The presented crystal structures provide explanation
for the molecular mechanism of dimerization of PD-L1 and
the mechanism of inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 interaction.
The PD-L1 homodimer distantly resembles that of PD-1/
PD-L1 (both proteins are characterized by similar IgG
like fold [20] in that the two molecules of PD-L1 interact
via their PD-1 binding surfaces). Nevertheless, overlay
of the PD-L1 homodimer with the PD-1/PD-L1 dimer
demonstrates that the second PD-L1 molecule within the
homodimer does not fully corresponds to the orientation
of PD-1 (Figure 4A). In the respective structures, both
BMS-202 and BMS-8 are located at the center of the
homodimer filling a deep hydrophobic pocket contributing
multiple additional interactions between the monomers.
The compounds interact with both PD-L1 molecules using
hydrophobic surfaces physiologically involved in the
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This provides the rationale for
the activity of BMS compounds in dissociating the PD-1/
PD-L1 complex. Not only the inhibitor partially covers
the PD-1 binding site in each PD-L1 molecule within the
complex, but the interaction of the two monomers fully
occludes the PD-1 binding surface thus preventing the
interaction with PD-1. Furthermore, neither BMS-202 nor
BMS-8 induce changes in the overall protein fold, so that
the arrangement of PD-L1 backbone remains the same as
in the apo-form and in the PD-1/PD-L1 complex (Figure
4B).
The most important finding of this study is in
unambiguous definition of the druggable “hot spots”
[30-32] at the surface of PD-L1 suitable for targeting
with low-molecular weight inhibitors. Even though
the atomic resolution structures of PD-L1 [19] [33]
and recently its complex with PD-1 [20] have been
published by others and our group providing directions
for rational inhibitor design, the large, relatively flat
interaction surface significantly complicated the task.
Based on the analysis of the structure of the PD-1/PDL1 complex, we have recently proposed the three likely
hot spots [20], but only the structures reported in this
study allowed to confirm the suitability of those for the
design of small molecule inhibitors and defined particular
interactions (pharmacophore) which should be explored.
Importantly, these “hot spots” can likely be targeted by
the compounds that not necessarily induce dimerization.
Our study redefines the previously proposed sites and
allows pinpointing PD-L1 residues important for the
inhibitor binding with higher accuracy. As shown by the
present crystal structures, BMS-202 and BMS-8 each
target two of the previously described hot spots, which
now may be treated as a single continuous interaction
area. This target space consists of Tyr56, Met115, Ile116,

and PD-L2 demonstrated that both BMS-8 and BMS-202
are specific for PD-L1. No crystal structure of the human
PD-L2 (hPD-L2) is available to date and only murine PDL2 (mPD-L2) extracellular domain was crystallized in
an apo form (PDB 3BOV) and in the complex with the
murine PD-1 (mPD-1; PDB 3BP5). To speculate on the
likely determinants of BMS compound specificity, we
created a homology model of hPD-L2 based on mPD-L2
structures. Both proteins contain a tryptophan residue
(Trp57 in hPD-L1 and Trp110 in mPD-L2) in the center of
the PD-1 interacting surfaces. However, the sidechain of
this residue in hPD-L1 is hidden inside hydrophobic core
of the protein (does not contribute to the interaction with
PD-1 or BMS-202), while the sidechain of corresponding
tryptophan in mPD-L2 is exposed to the solvent in the apo
structure and oriented towards the PD-1 core in mPD-1/
mPD-L2 complex. Since the amino acid sequence identity
of extracellular domains of hPD-L2 and mPD-L2 is
73% and both proteins contain tryptophan at equivalent
position (Ala-Trp-Asp-Tyr sequence in both proteins), it
is likely that the sidechain of Trp57 in hPD-L2 has the
same conformation as the corresponding tryptophan in
mPD-L2. The resulting different surface arrangement of
hPD-L1 and hPD-L2 at the binding site would explain the
specificity of BMS compounds for hPD-L1.
In conclusion, the presented data documents
structural determinants guiding the recognition of small
molecule inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by PD-L1.
The unambiguous definition of the molecular “hot spots”
at the surface of PD-L1 provides solid basis for future
development of immunomodulating small molecules
against cancer.

mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Solubilized fraction was clarified
by high speed centrifugation. hPD-L1 and hPD-L2 were
refolded by drop-wise dilution into 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0
containing 1 M L-Arg hydrochloride, 0.25 mM oxidized
glutathione and 0.25 mM reduced glutathione for hPD-L1
and 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 containing 1 M NDSB201, 0.2
M NaCl, 5 mM cysteamine and 0.5 mM cystamine for
hPD-L2. hPD-1 was refolded in similar manner in 0.1 M
Tris pH 8.0 containing 0.4 M L-Arg hydrochloride, 2 mM
EDTA, 5 mM cystamine and 0.5 mM cysteamine. After
refolding, the proteins were dialyzed 3 times against 10
mM Tris pH 8.0 containing 20 mM NaCl, and purified
by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 (GE
Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing 20 mM
NaCl. The purity and protein folding were evaluated by
SDS-PAGE and NMR, respectively.

Analytical size-exclusion chromatography
The oligomeric state of tested proteins was analyzed
by size exclusion chromatography. Superdex 75 10/30 HR
(GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with PBS pH 7.4 and
calibrated using globular proteins of known molecular
weight. Approximate molecular weight of apo-PD-L1 and
PD-L1-small molecule complex (3:1 compound : protein
molar ratio) were estimated using the calibration curve.

Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)
DSF analysis was performed according to Niesen
and colleagues [26]. In brief PD-L1 and PD-L2 (both
12.5 µM) were incubated alone, with BMS-202 or BMS8 (both at 37.5 µM) in the presence of SYPRO Orange
Dye (Life Technologies). Constant temperature gradient of
0.2°C/min was applied and changes in fluorescence were
monitored using real time thermocycler (BioRad). Melting
temperature (Tm) was estimated from the first derivative of
fluorescence intensity as a function of temperature.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression and purification of recombinant PDL1, PD-L2 and PD-1
The gene encoding human PD-L1 (amino acids
18-134) was cloned into the pET-21b, the gene encoding
human PD-L2 (20-220) was cloned into pET28a and that
of human PD-1 (33-150, Cys93 exchanged to serine) into
pET-24d. Proteins were expressed in the E. coli BL21
(DE3). Cells were cultured in LB at 37°C. The protein
production was induced with 1 mM IPTG at OD600 of 1.0
and the cells were cultured for additional 5h. For hPD1, after induction the temperature was lowered to 30°C.
Proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies which were
collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton
X-100, 10 mM EDTA and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
and once more with the same buffer with no detergent.
The inclusion bodies were stirred overnight in 50 mM
Tris pH 8.0 containing 6M GuHCl, 200 mM NaCl and 10

NMR methods
Uniform 15N labeling was obtained by expressing
the protein in the M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl
as the sole nitrogen source. Unlabeled proteins were
prepared as for crystallization. For NMR measurements
the buffer was exchanged by gel filtration to PBS pH 7.4
(PD-L1) or 25 mM sodium phosphate containing 100 mM
NaCl pH 6.4 (PD-1). 10% (v/v) of D2O was added to the
samples to provide lock signal. All spectra were recorded
at 300K using a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer.
Binding of the compounds was analyzed by titrating
the 15N-labeled PD-L1 (0.3 mM) and recording the 1H-15N
HMQC spectra prior and after addition of the compound.

/ PD-1 was evaluated using AIDA [25]. 15N-labeled PD-1
(0.2 mM) was slightly overtitrated with unlabeled PDL1. Compound was aliquoted into the resulting mixture.
During the experiment the 1H-15N signals were monitored
by HMQC experiment.
Changes in the oligomeric state of PD-L1 in the
presence of tested compounds were monitored by titration
of unlabeled PD-L1 (0.3 mM) while recording 1H spectra
prior and after addition of the compound. The approximate
molecular weights of protein populations present in the
sample were determined by analyzing the linewidth
(relaxation time) of well separated NMR signals.

pyridine-3-carbaldehyde,  3-bromo-4-((2-methyl-[1,1’biphenyl]-3-yl)methoxy)benzaldehyde and the final
compounds were prepared according to procedures
described in BMS patent [18] with minor modifications
(Figure S12). All reagents were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich and used without additional purification. NMR
spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 300 or 600 MHz
spectrometers (Figures S13-S16). All chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) in Hz. The
identity and purity of all compounds was additionally
analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
and HPLC.

Crystallization of PD-L1 in complex with BMS202 and BMS-8
Purified PD-L1 in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing
20 mM NaCl was mixed with BMS-202 or BMS-8 at
1:1 molar ratio. The complex was concentrated to 8 mg/
ml. Sitting drop vapor diffusion setup and commercially
available buffer sets were used to screen for crystallization
conditions. Initially obtained crystals were optimized
according to art. Diffraction-quality crystals of PD-L1/
BMS-202 complex were obtained at room temperature
from 0.01 M Tris pH 8.5 containing 0.30 M sodium
chloride and 27% (w/v) PEG 4000 while those of PD-L1/
BMS-8 complex from 0.2 M ammonium formate and 20%
(w/v) PEG 3350.

Structure determination and refinement
Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen
without additional cryoprotection. The diffraction data
was collected at the Helmholtz Centrum 14.1 beamline
at BESSY (Berlin, Germany) [34]. The data were
indexed and integrated using XDS [35-36] and scaled
and merged using Scala [37]. Molecular replacement
was calculated using Phaser [38]. The structure of the
recently solved human PD-L1 (PDB 5C3T) was used as
a probe [20]. The protein models were manually built
in the resulting electron density maps using Coot [39].
Restrained refinement was performed using Phenix [40]
and Refmac 5.0 [41]. Five percent of the reflections were
used for cross-validation analysis. The behavior of Rfree
was employed to monitor the refinement strategy. Inhibitor
model and restraints were prepared in eLBOW [42] and
introduced into the model at advanced stage of refinement
when electron density describing the ligand was clearly
visible. Water molecules were added using Coot and
manually inspected. Molecular graphics was prepared with
PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/).
