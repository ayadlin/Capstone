ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a poor prognosis, in part, due to the
therapy-recalcitrant nature of the disease. Loss of the CDK4/6 inhibitor CDKN2A is a
signature genetic event in PDA. Therefore, PDA may be amenable to treatment with
pharmaceutical CDK4/6 inhibitors. Surprisingly, response to CDK4/6 inhibition was
highly variable in PDA models, and was associated with differential suppression of RBregulated gene expression. Mitotic genes were repressed and FOXM1 was uniformly
attenuated; however, genes involved in DNA replication were uniquely suppressed
in sensitive models. Aberrant induction of Cyclin E1 was associated with resistance,
and knockdown demonstrated synergistic suppression of the cell cycle with CDK4/6
inhibition. Combination therapies are likely required for the effective treatment
of disease, and drug screening demonstrated additive/antagonistic interactions
with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Agents dependent on mitotic progression (taxanes/PLK1
inhibitors) were antagonized by CDK4/6 inhibition, while the response to 5-FU and
gemcitabine exhibited drug specific interactions. PI3K/MTOR and MEK inhibitors
potently cooperated with CDK4/6 inhibition. These agents were synergistic with
CDK4/6 inhibition, blocked the aberrant upregulation of Cyclin E1, and yielded potent
inhibition of tumor cell growth. Together, these data identify novel mechanisms of
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitions and provide a roadmap for combination therapies
in the treatment of PDA.

INTRODUCTION

of genetic alterations, some of which could be amenable
to targeted therapy. One of these alterations is the genetic
loss or epigenetic silencing of the CDKN2A tumor
suppressor [5-8].
The CDKN2A gene encodes the p16ink4a protein
that is a potent inhibitor of Cyclin Dependent Kinases 4
and 6 (CDK4/6). Physiologically, p16ink4a represents a
key barrier to oncogenic transformation, as it is induced
by oncogenic stress and leads to senescence in multiple
disease relevant settings [9]. In the context of PDA, it
has been hypothesized that p16ink4a loss is selected
for to enable the progression of KRAS mutated cells
[10-13]. Correspondingly, it has been shown that the
over-expression of p16ink4a is dominant to the effects

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a poor
prognosis with a 5-year survival of approximately 6%
[1-3]. The approved systemic therapies have a relatively
modest impact on survival, and PDA is considered a
therapy recalcitrant disease [1, 2, 4]. Interestingly, the
treatment of PDA has remained largely dependent on the
use of systemic chemotherapy regimens, and there are
basically no targeted approaches to treatment that exploit
the underlying genetic features of pancreatic cancer.
PDA is largely driven by oncogenic events (e.g. KRAS),
which historically are considered “non-actionable” from
a therapeutic perspective. However, PDA exhibits a range

of KRAS in cell culture models and is capable of reestablishing a senescence-like arrest in established cancer
models [14-17]. The only known functional target of
p16ink4a are the kinases CDK4 and CDK6 [9, 18-23].
p16ink4a-mediated arrest is selectively bypassed by
CDK4 mutations that disrupt the association with the
inhibitor [24, 25]. Similarly, loss of RB, which is the down
stream target for CDK4/6 bypasses the growth inhibitory
activity of p16ink4a [9, 26]. Furthermore, analysis of
mutual-exclusivity in cancer demonstrates that there is
a pronounced reciprocal relationship between the loss of
p16ink4a, deregulation of CDK4/6, and loss of RB [25,
27, 28]. Thus these events describe a single pathway,
wherein the predominant event occurring in PDA is loss of
p16ink4a, and suggest that restoring its biological function
could represent a key means to limit the growth of KRAS
driven cancers.
While multiple CDK-inhibitory agents have been
evaluated in clinical trials, only recently have highly
specific CDK4/6 inhibitory drugs been developed [29,
30]. Consistent with the function of p16ink4a, they
induce a highly potent G1-arrest that is dependent on the
suppression of CDK4/6 and the presence of RB tumor
suppressor (RB) [31-33]. RB is a critical downstream
effector of CDK4/6 and regulates the expression of a host
of target genes through interactions with E2F and other
transcription factor complexes [34]. These targets include
CDK/Cyclin subunits (e.g. Cyclin E and Cyclin A),
DNA replication factors (e.g. MCM7 and PCNA), genes
involved in dNTP metabolism (e.g. thymidylate synthase
and ribonucleotide reductase), and mitotic progression
(e.g. PLK1 and CDC20). In preclinical models, activation
of RB via CDK4/6 inhibition can induce senescent-like
arrest [29, 30, 35-39]. An important parallel effector of
CDK4/6 is FOXM1, which is stabilized by direct CDK4/6
mediated phosphorylation and stimulates expression of
cell cycle regulated genes [40, 41]. Recently, clinical
studies have demonstrated that CDK4/6 inhibitors can
have potent single agent activity in select tumor models
ostensibly addicted to kinase activity, such as liposarcoma
and mantle cell lymphoma [42-45]. Additionally, in breast
cancer CDK4/6 inhibitors have demonstrated highly
significant activity in combination with endocrine agents
[46-50]. However, it is also clear that there are features of
tumor behavior that we do not fully understand, as other
diseases, which frequently lose p16ink4a had minimal
response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in the clinic [44, 45].
Here we find that CDK4/6 inhibition can have
a potent impact on PDA models. While some models
exhibit a durable response, acquired/intrinsic resistance
can bypass the action of CDK4/6 inhibition in the majority
of models analyzed via a novel mechanism involving
induction of Cyclin E1. Drug screening reveals a complex
and mechanism specific impact of CDK4/6 inhibitors on
drug-sensitivity. However, specific combination therapies
clearly expand the therapeutic potency of CDK4/6

inhibition for the treatment of PDA.

RESULTS
CDKN2A-deficient
PDA models
exhibit
differential response to CDK4/6 inhibition
Eight pancreatic cancer cell lines were screened
for their proliferative response to CDK4/6 inhibition.
In addition to multiple PDA signature mutations (e.g.
KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53) these cell lines carried a
non-functional CDKN2A gene (Fig. 1A). In order to
test sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of PD-0332991, and
proliferation was measured by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine
(BrdU) incorporation (Fig. 1B). Results showed that
some model experienced a complete suppression of
proliferation (e.g. CAPAN2), while others were modestly
or mostly resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitor (e.g. HS766T
and PL5). Recognizing that PDA cell lines display
differential proliferative responses to acute treatment,
long-term treatment responses were also monitored in
order to evaluate if the responses are maintained over
time (Fig 1C). CAPAN2 cells being the most sensitive to
the acute treatment, also exhibited significant suppression
of proliferation with long-term treatment. In contrast,
cell proliferation occurred in PL45, ASPC1 and PL5,
albeit at a reduced extent relative to control. These
results indicate that there is differential proliferative
response to CDK4/6 inhibition within CDKN2A deficient
PDA cell models, and suggests that there are additional
determinants of therapeutic sensitivity. A possible
explanation of these results is that in resistant models
the phosphorylation of RB is CDK4/6 independent. In
analysis of RB phosphorylation by mobility shift and
with phospho-specific antibodies, CDK4/6 inhibition did
suppress the phosphorylation of RB across all models
interrogated (Fig 1D). These results were confirmed by
reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis, wherein RB
dephosphorylation was the only consistently observed
change amongst 53 phosphoproteins analyzed (not
shown). Thus, from conventional assessment of the RBpathway, CDK4/6 inhibitors should be actionable.

PDA models exhibit distinct suppression of E2F
gene expression with CDK4/6 inhibition
To interrogate the downstream signaling from
CDK4/6 inhibition, we analyzed the expression of RB/E2F
target genes using a high-density RBTARGET Affymetrix
array (probes listed in supplemental tables). Using a 2-fold
cutoff and p<0.05 we found that there were many RB/E2F
targets genes that were repressed potently with CDK4/6
inhibition (Fig. 2A). Specifically, a large number of genes
6513

were repressed in CAPAN2 cells that exhibit a durable
response to CDK4/6 inhibition. In contrast, the PL45 and
PL5 cell lines exhibited modest suppression of such genes
(Fig. 2B). Interestingly, by gene ontology analyses these
groups of genes segregated along biological processes
(Fig. 2C). There was potent suppression of mitotic genes
across cell models with CDK4/6 inhibition; however,
the suppression of DNA replication proteins was largely
restricted to CAPAN2. Bar-graphs demonstrating the
repression of representative genes are shown (Fig. 2D).
One of the key determinants of mitotic gene expression is
FOXM1 [41]. FOXM1 is both a transcriptional target of
RB/E2F, and a direct target for protein stability by CDK4/6
[40]. By gene expression profiling FOXM1 repression was
largely restricted to CAPAN2 cells; however, by RPPA
analysis FOXM1 protein levels were reduced uniformly
(Fig. 2E). These data suggest that there is a fundamental
difference in the mechanisms underlying the repression of

different classes of cell cycle genes, but that suppression
of genes involved in DNA replication was particularly
associated with durable response to CDK4/6 inhibition.

Intrinsic aberrant regulation of Cyclin E is a key
determinant of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition
In an attempt to decipher the mechanism underlying
the specific resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition, we
interrogated the expression of critical CDK and Cyclins
that are important for progression through G1/S. These
data demonstrated that certain genes are repressed
irrespectively (e.g. Cyclin A2) (Fig. 3A). However,
there was a consistent upregulation of Cyclin D1 in all
models (Fig 3A). Additionally in PL45 and PL5 cells that
are relatively resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition there was a
reproducible upregulation of Cyclin E1 transcript (Fig

3A). The induction of Cyclin D1 has been previously
described in other models [32, 33]; however, the induction
of Cyclin E1 is a unique observation in the setting of PDA.
Therefore, the levels of Cyclin E1 were determined by
immunoblotting across all cell lines (Fig. 3B). These data
revealed that cyclin E1 induction was particularly apparent
in multiple cell lines including PL5, MIAPACA2, PANC1
and HS766T. To determine the functional relevance
of cyclin upregulation in PDA models exposed to PD0332991, RNAi was used to knockdown Cyclin D1 and
Cyclin E1. Individually, both Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1
knockdown inhibited cell cycle progression as determined
by BrdU incorporation (Fig. 3C/D). In the case of
Cyclin D1 depletion there was an additive effect on cell
cycle progression in combination with PD-0332991. In
contrast, Cyclin E1 deletion prevented virtually all BrdU

incorporation in combination with PD-0332991. These
data indicate that Cyclin E1 upregulation contributes
to the observed resistance of PDA models to CDK4/6
inhibition, and suggests a unique feature of signaling that
compromises the sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition in PDA
models.

CDK4/6 inhibition results in both antagonistic
and additive responses with other anti-cancer
therapies
It is widely recognized that combination approaches
to therapy will be required for the success of targeted
agents in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Given the
modest response to CDK4/6 inhibitors we interrogated

the impact of PD-0332991 on 304 anti-cancer compounds
(supplemental tables). Drug screening was performed
in PL45, PL5 and MIAPACA2 PDA models, which are
relatively resistant to PD-0332991. Cells were treated
singly with the drug library or with concurrent PD0332991. Cell survival was determined by CTG analysis
and representative data is depicted in the scatter plots (Fig.
4A). To globally evaluate the response of select classes of
drugs, heatmaps were generated plotting the log fraction
of surviving cells to define the relative response (Fig.
4B). Antagonistic responses are drug combinations where
CDK4/6 inhibitor protected cells from the other agent. We
observed robust antagonism of specific chemotherapeutic
drugs, PLK1 inhibitors, and other drugs specifically
dependent on ongoing cell cycle progression for their
mechanism of action (Fig. 4C, left panel). In contrast,
additive effects were observed for MEK across a relatively
broad range of compounds (Fig. 4B and C, middle).
Similarly PI3K (e.g. GDC0941), MTOR (e.g. AZD0855),

and dual PI3K/MTOR (e.g. GDC0980) inhibitors
exhibited cooperative inhibition with PD-0332991 (Fig.
4B and C, right). In all cases the overall impact of CDK4/6
inhibition was statistically significant across the drug class
selected.

Drug context specific effects of CDK4/6 inhibition
on chemotherapies
The drug screening indicated that CDK4/6
inhibition has the potential to antagonize the effect of
various types of chemotherapies. We speculated that the
cytostatic effect of CDK4/6 inhibition may represent the
principle mechanism leading to a decreased efficacy of
drugs targeting the mitotic machinery. As shown, PLK1
inhibitors were antagonized by co-treatment with PD0332991 (Fig. 5A). Since such drugs can have off-target
effects, PLK1, which is an essential kinase during mitosis,
was depleted (Fig. 5A). In absence of CDK4/6 inhibitors,

PLK1 inhibition led to significant reduction in viability,
but in the presence of CDK4/6 inhibitor, this effect was
significantly diminished. This finding suggested that even
the modest cell cycle inhibition observed in PL5 and PL45
models will still impinge on the cytotoxic effects of antimitotic agents, such as docetaxel and paclitaxel that are
present in the drug screen.
In addition to anti-mitotic drugs, PD-0332991
treatment significantly antagonized gemcitabine activity
in drug screening. Since the anti-metabolites gemcitabine
and 5-Fhoururacil (5-FU) are both used in the treatment
of PDA, we specifically evaluated response to these
drugs. Initially, we simply recapitulated the antagonism
of Gemcitabine-mediated toxicity (Fig. 5B). These shortterm effects were re-affirmed in the analysis of overall

cell survival by crystal violet analysis (Fig. 5C). In this
setting, gemcitabine effectively killed the PDA cells;
however, in the presence of PD-0332991 a fraction of cells
survived. These findings contrasted with the observation
for 5-FU, which although having limited effect, was not
antagonized by CDK4/6 inhibition and in some lines
there was evidence of cooperative effects (Fig. 5C). A
likely basis for this differential response relates to the
role of E2F target genes deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and
thymidylate synthase (TS). DCK is required to activate
gemcitabine and cells exposed to PD-0332991 have
reduced level of this protein (Fig. 5D). In contrast TS is
the target for 5FU-mediated inhibition and reduced levels
of TS are associated with increased drug sensitivity. In
the PDA models, treatment with PD-0332991 suppressed

TS levels (Fig. 5D). Treatment with 5FU leads to a
covalent bond with TS, and thus stoichiometric inhibition
of TS is ostensibly easier to achieve. Consistent with
this hypothesis, we observed additive effects between
PD-0332991 and 5FU and the suppression of BrdU

incorporation (Fig. 5E). Together, these findings indicate
that while combination treatments of CDK4/6 inhibitor
and chemotherapy can be antagonistic, there are specific
conditions where additive responses can be identified
based on mechanism of action.

Concurrent inhibition of CDK4/6 either with
PI3K/mTOR or MEK inhibitors display
cooperation in suppression of PDA proliferation

Interestingly, and contrary to multiple other tumor
models, PDA models exhibited disparate responses
to CDK4/6 inhibition that were not dependent on the
canonical RB-pathways. In breast cancer, HCC, glioma,
melanoma and other models, the response to CDK4/6
inhibition is simply dependent on the presence of RB [31,
33, 51]. Such tumors generally have lost CDKN2A, which
provided the rationale for the study herein. Interestingly,
within PDA there was a diversity of response to CDK4/6
suppression. Particularly, there were multiple models
which exhibitary features associated with partial cell
cycle inhibition, or relatively complete resistance. These
findings are consistent with the work of others [52]. While
it would be expected that there would be a full bypass
of the requirement for CDK4/6 this was not observed,
as RB phosphorylation remained largely dependent on
CDK4/6. Additionally, there was significant suppression
of a subset of E2F target genes. Interestingly, these genes
are largely involved in mitosis, and are controlled by
the DREAM and FOXM1 complexes that are ostensibly
still effectively repressed in this setting [41]. In fact, we
observed similar FOXM1 protein attenuation in all models
studied, which is consistent with work demonstrating that
FOXM1 protein accumulation is dependent on CDK4/6
activity [40]. However, the control of genes involved in
DNA replication has emerged as a key RB-dependent
function that is associated with terminal cell cycle arrest
[53]. Therefore, the data here suggest that in select tumors
models there is an uncoupling of these aspects of cell
cycle control. In breast cancer and additional models PD0332991 results in robust suppression of the full spectrum
of E2F target gents and therefore indicates that pancreatic
cancer is somewhat unique in this aspect of cell cycle
regulatory uncoupling.
The realization that such uncoupling can occur
necessitated a highly focused analysis of CDK genes/
proteins that drive the G1/S transition. Our group and
others have shown that CDK4/6 inhibitors can lead to the
accumulation of Cyclin D1 levels [32, 33]. The basis of
this response remains under study, but it could reflect more
potent mitogenic signaling in the G1-phase of the cell
cycle to stimulate the Cyclin D1 promoter. Importantly,
we have observed this response in multiple models that
exhibit a profound durable response to CDK4/6 inhibition;
therefore, Cyclin D1 upregulation does not appear to be
associated with resistance to PD-0332991. Surprisingly,
our work revealed that resistant models exhibited an
aberrant upregulation of Cyclin E. In general, CDK4/6
inhibition will reduce the level of Cyclin E transcripts;
therefore, the upregulation in resistant models was
particularly unexpected. Importantly, we could show that
the levels of cyclin. DI and E contributed to the response
and suggests that such proteins will modulate the durable
response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Cyclin E-depletion was
particularly synergistic with PD-0332991. These results
agree with the overall concept that Cyclin E deregulation

As a whole, PI3K/MTOR inhibitors showed
cooperative effects in concert with CDK4/6 inhibitor
treatment assessed by viability assay in drug screening.
In order to examine the mechanisms, BrdU incorporation
was assessed after treatment with BEZ235, GDC0980
and AZD0855 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor
(Fig 6A). Results indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitor in
combination with these PI3K/MTOR inhibitors has a
synergistic effect in suppression of cell cycle. PL5 cells
that exhibit resistance to both the CDK4/6 inhibitor and
PI3K/MTOR inhibitors as single agents displayed a
complete proliferative halt after treatment in both acute
and long-term responses (Fig. 6B and C). This suppression
of proliferation with co-treatment was associated with
suppression of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 expression that
is observed with PD-0332991 (Fig. 6C). Additionally,
there was suppression of additional critical cell cycle
regulatory proteins including CDK2 and Cyclin A, (Fig.
6D). In keeping with the suppression of multiple cyclins,
although CDK4/6 inhibition has a profound effect on the
phosphorylation of RB, there is residual phosphorylation
that was further suppressed in the context of co-treatment
with PI3K/MTOR inhibitors (Fig. 6D). These data suggest
that even low levels of RB phosphorylation can facilitate
cell cycle progression, and provide the emphasis for full
suppression of CDK-activity through complementary
mechanisms.
In addition to PI3K/MTOR, MEK inhibitors also
had additive effects in concert with CDK4/6 suppression.
We demonstrated the cooperation at the level of cell
cycle progression by BrdU incorporation and found
that similar suppression of proliferation with the
combination treatment (Fig. 6E). The biochemical effect
of MEK inhibitors on RB phosphorylation paralleled the
observation with PI3K/MTOR inhibition and revealing
a similar basis for cooperation (Fig. 6F). Together, these
findings suggest that PI3K/MTOR and MEK inhibitors
could be particularly in combination with CDK4/6
inhibitors due to complementary mechanisms of action.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of pancreatic cancer is a particular
challenge and new therapeutic approaches are urgently
needed. One appealing means of intervention is to target
specific genetic features of disease, and CDKN2A loss
is one of the most common genetic alterations in PDA.
Ostensibly, the loss of the kinase inhibitor results in
aberrant CDK4/6 activation that could be targeted through
the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Here we challenged this
simple precept in preclinical models.

can contribute to bypass of CDK4/6 inhibitors [54].
In recognition that many PDA models did not harbor
a particularly durable response to CDK4/6 inhibition,
combination treatments were interrogated. This work
revealed that CDK4/6 inhibition has complex interactions
on the response to multiple agents. In particular,
and consistent with others [55], CDK4/6 inhibition
compromised the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic
agents that primarily act via mitotic catastrophe including
PLK1 inhibitors and taxanes. This result suggests the
need to develop a rational metronomic schedule for drug
treatment. In contrast, anti-metabolites are more difficult
to predict as RB/E2F regulate a host of genes that are
drug targets or otherwise modify dNTP pools [56]. This
aspect of RB/E2F function is particularly important when
evaluating anti-metabolites that would cooperate or be
antagonized by CDK4/6 inhibition. It should be noted
that in addition to the enzyme interrogated herein RB/
E2F modulates DHFR and RNRII levels that have highly
significant effect on dNTP pools.
In contrast with chemotherapy, we observed highly
reproducible additive effects across a relatively large
panel of MEK and PI3K/MTOR inhibitors with CDK4/6
inhibition. These findings are particularly important since
MEK and PI3K/MTOR inhibitors have been considered
for the treatment of pancreatic cancer [57]. As shown here
CDK4/6 inhibition can have relatively subtle effects on
cell cycle and suppression of proliferation. In contrast,
drug combinations yielded potent cytostatic response
in all models tested. In the case of PI3K/MTOR the
induction of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E that occurs with
CDK4/6 inhibition was completely blocked resulting in
profound de-phosphorylation of RB. These finding are
consistent with the work of others showing that cyclin
D1 levels are under the control of MEK or MTOR
signaling [58, 59]. Presumably, these data suggest that
one of the “weaknesses” of pharmacological CDK4/6
inhibitors is compensatory or alternative regulators
of RB phosphorylation. In the case of MEK and PI3K/
MTOR, there are well described mechanisms through
which they limit the expression of Cyclins and suppress
CDK activity. Ostensibly in many therapeutic contexts,
these mechanisms of attenuating CDK-activity are
NOT sufficient to halt cell cycle; however, due to the
complementary mechanism of action such agents are
particularly effective in concert with CDK4/6 inhibitors.
Likely, a similar mechanism could underlie the profound
clinical activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine
therapy; since in ER-positive breast cancer estrogen
signaling is required for the expression of cyclin D1 and E
[60, 61]. Together, the work herein provides a roadmap for
considering the clinical utilization of CDK4/6 inhibitors in
the treatment of PDA.

Cell culture, chemicals and antibodies
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines PL45,
MIAPACA-2, PANC1, CAPAN2, BXPC3, HS 766T,
ASPC1, PL5 were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cells except for
MIAPACA2 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. MIAPACA2
cells were grown in DMEM with fetal bovine serum and
horse serum to a final concentration of 10% and 2.5%
respectively plus antibiotics. Drugs used in this study
were purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Compounds
were diluted in DMSO to 5 mM stock concentrations. PD0332991 was employed at a concentration range of 0.5-2
µM. Drugs screen was performed at 2.5 µM. Antibodies
against CDK2, CCNE1, CCNA2, GAPDH, total ERK,
p-ERK, lamin B, DCK, TS and p27 were purchased from
Santa Cruz biotechnology. While, antibodies against
total RB, p-RB(780), total Akt, p-Akt (ser473) were
purchased from Cell signaling. Cyclin D1 (AB3) was from
NeoMarkers.

Drug Screen
A library of 304 drugs from Selleck Chemicals
was used for drug screening. Cells were grown in 96well plates at 2500 cell per well. Subsequent to plating,
cell were treated with 1µM PD-0332991 or DMSO for
24 hours at 37° and 5.0 CO2. The next day, cells were
treated with the drug library to final concentration of
2.5 uM, and incubated at 37° and 5.0 CO2 for 72 hours.
Following treatment, viability was assessed using
Celltiter Glo(Promega). The relative fluorescence units
were detected and analyzed by a BIOTEK plate reader
and Gen5 software. Data analysis was performed using
Drug-decode macro (developed by David Haan, UT
Southwestern).

Flow cytometry
Cell were trypsinized and fixed in 70%
Ethanol post a 2 hour incubation with Brdu labeling
solution(Invitrogen). Fixed cells were incubated in
2M HCl with 0.3mg/ml pepsin solution for 30 minutes
followed by addition of 0.1 M sodium tetraborate
solution(pH 8.5). After acid neutralization, cells were
washed twice with IFA(10mM HEPES(pH 7.4), 25
mM NACI, 4% FBS) buffer. Cells were then incubated
with FITC labeled anti-Brdu(BD Pharmingen) at 1:10
dilution for 30 min at room temperature. After Brdu
labeling, Propidium iodine(20ug/ml) and RNAse(4ug/ml)

siRNA; Dharmacon) at a final concentration 50nmol/L
with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX(Invitrogen) according to
manufacture’s instructions. Transfections with a control
sRNA(TMEM) served as a negative control.

Western blot analysis and reverse phase protein
array analysis

Gene Expression analysis
Cells were treated with vehicle or 1µM PD-0332991
for 48 hours (RBTARGET) or 120 hours (Agilent Array).
The RBTARGET array is a custom Affymetrix Gene
Chip that encompasses genes regulated by RB and
highly correlated genes together with additional gene for
normalization, full list of the probes on the RBTARGET
platform are provided in the supplemental data. Total RNA
was recovered and hybridized using standard procedures.
Data analysis was performed on normalized data. To
define differentially expressed genes, a cutoff of 2-fold
and p<0.05 was utilized.

Pancreatic cell lines were lysed in RIPA buffer(10%
NP-40 substitute, 1% SDS, 500mM Tris-HCI(pH 7.4),
1.5M NaCI, 5% sodium doxycholate, 10mM EDTA)
containing both complete protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets (Roche) and phosphatases inhibitors (Roche).
Protein concentrations were subsequently measured
with the BCA protein assay DCtm Protein Assay (BIORAD) using manufacture’s protocol. These samples were
resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted
to Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane. Membranes were
washed with wash buffer (0.1% Tween-20/1x saline).
Followed by incubation with blocking solution (5%
BSA, 0.1% Tween-20; saline). Primary antibodies
(1/500 dilution) at 4°C overnight. The membranes were
then washed in were applent buffer and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). Antibody detection was
performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction
(SuperSignal) as directed by manufacture.
Protein lysates were prepared from cell treated with
vehicle or 1 µM PD-0332991 for 48 hours. Preparation
from RPPA were as directed by the MD Anderson RPPA
shared service, and the analysis of the signals were
performed using their standardized procedures. The
difference in normalized log protein values are presented
in the analysis.
