BACKGROUND. There are conflicting reports regarding the association between
Chlamydia psittaci (Cps) and ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) and the efficacy of
antibiotics for OAL. In the current study, the authors attempted to clarify the
association between Cps and OAL and the efficacy of antibiotics for OAL.
METHODS. Two meta-analyses were conducted. One focused on the association
between Cps and OAL across geographic regions and among different studies.

wide variation noted between geographic regions and even between studies from
the same geographic region with regard to the rate of Cps positivity. The 4 studies
concerning the efficacy of antibiotics for OAL were from Italy, Austria, Taiwan,
and the U.S. and included 42 patients. Twenty patients (48%) achieved some
response (complete response in 8 patients, partial response in 8 patients, and
minimal response in 4 patients). Twenty patients also had stable disease, and 2
patients progressed during antibiotic therapy. Objective documentation of
response (radiographs or clinical slit-lamp photographs) was available for only 3
of the 42 patients. Seven additional patients developed disease recurrence after
their initial response or stable disease after antibiotic therapy; 6 of these cases of
disease recurrence occurred during the first 12 months of follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS. The findings of the current study suggest a striking variability in
the association between Cps and OAL across geographic regions and even
between studies from the same geographic regions. The overall rate of Cps positivity in our meta-analysis (23%) was much lower than that reported in the original report. The current study findings also suggest that antibiotics have variable
efficacy against OAL. Future prospective trials with standard objective response
criteria and a longer follow-up period would be necessary to evaluate the role of
antibiotics in the treatment of OAL further. Cancer 2007;110:809–15.  2007

O

cular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma; the most common histologic type of OAL is mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.1 MALT lymphoma, a
low-grade lymphoma, accounts for 60% to 80% of all cases of OAL.2,3

Some recent studies suggest a possible increase in the
incidence of MALT lymphoma in the last decade.1
Much attention has been focused on determining
whether OAL is caused by an autoimmune disorder,
chronic antigenic stimulation, or both. Prior studies
have linked gastric MALT lymphoma with Helicobacter
pylori,4 cutaneous MALT lymphoma with Borrelia
burgdorferi,5 and splenic marginal zone lymphoma
with hepatitis C.6 Recently, in a study from Italy, Ferreri et al. reported an association between Chlamydia
psittaci (Cps) and OAL.7 However, several other studies from other regions of the world have failed to
demonstrate such an association.8–16
Because of the evidence that MALT lymphoma
may be caused by chronic infection, some authors
have investigated the efficacy of antibiotics in the
treatment of OAL, both in patients with confirmed
bacterial infection and in patients with unknown
infection status. Reports published to date regarding
the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for OAL have presented conflicting findings.17–21
We conducted 2 meta-analyses to shed more light
on the association between Cps and OAL and the efficacy of oral antibiotics for the treatment of OAL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched
for publications regarding the association between
Cps and OAL and for publications concerning the efficacy of antibiotics for the treatment of OAL. The literature search spanned the period between April 2004
(when what to our knowledge was the first report of
the association between Cps and OAL was published)
and October 2006. For each study, the following
details were recorded: the geographic region in which
the patients with OAL were treated, the age of the
patients, patient gender, the histologic classification of
the lymphoma, the stage of lymphoma, the method of
DNA detection of Cps, and Cps status. For the metaanalysis of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment, the duration of antibiotic treatment and the response to
treatment were recorded. Tumor response was classified as complete response (eradication of all clinical
evidence of tumor), partial response (50% reduction
in the tumor), minimal response (<50% reduction in
the tumor), stable disease (no change), or progressive
disease (growth of the tumor by at least 25%).22

RESULTS
Association Between Cps and OAL
We found 11 studies published between April 2004
and October 2006 regarding the association between
Cps and OAL (Table 1). These included specimens

from 458 patients from 10 different countries and 4
different continents; 1 study included patients from > 1
country. The breakdown of studies and patients
by country was as follows: 3 studies from the U.S.
(20% of patients),8,15,16 3 studies from Italy (19% of
patients),7,16,19 1 study from China (12% of patients),16
2 studies from the Netherlands (9% of patients),11,16
1 study from the U.K. (9% of patients),16 2 studies
from Japan (8% of patients),13,14 1 study from Korea
(7% of patients),10 1 study from Germany (6% of
patients),16 1 study from Cuba (6% of patients),9 and
1 study from France (3% of patients).12
In 8 of the 11 studies, the method of DNA detection of Cps was modeled after the method of Madico
et al.23 The first step in their technique was to use
multiplex touchdown enzyme time-release polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.23 This step
detects 3 species of Chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Chlamydia psittaci) simultaneously. Next, CPS100 and CPS101
primers were used to produce a 111-base pair amplicon. These primers amplified highly conserved
regions encoding the 16S rRNA gene, which is conserved in Chlamydia species, and the 16S-23S rRNA
spacer, which varies in different Chlamydia species
and is unique for Cps.14 The 3 studies that did not
use the technique of Madico et al.23 only performed
the multiplex touchdown enzyme time-release PCR
using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissues, which detects Chlamydia (all 3
species), but did not perform the second step, which
would provide more specific information for Cps.
The age range and gender distribution of the
patients were available for 7 of the 11 studies. In
these 7 studies, there were 202 men and 179 women,
and the median age was 59 years (range, 8-95 years).
Of the 458 patients in the 11 studies, 346 (76%)
had MALT lymphoma; 9 patients (2%) had diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma; 1 patient had small lymphocytic lymphoma; and 79 patients (17%) had disease
identified as nonmarginal zone lymphoma, nonMALT, ‘‘other,’’ or not specified. The location of OAL
was specified in 382 patients (83%): 167 patients
(36%) had orbital tumors; 172 patients (38%) had
conjunctival tumors, 29 patients (6%) had lacrimal
gland tumors, and 1 patient (0.2%) had an eyelid tumor. In 13 patients (3%), lacrimal gland and orbital
involvement were included as a single entity. In 95
patients (21%), the exact location of the OAL was not
specified. Only 2 studies (including 22% of the
patients) included staging of the OAL. Approximately
80% of the patients in these studies had stage I disease and approximately 20% had stage IV disease.

* All positive cases were from the study by Chanudet et al.16

The proportions of patients who tested positive
for Cps are shown in Table 1. One hundred four of
the 458 patients with OAL (23%) were positive for
Cps. Of the 346 patients with ocular adnexal MALT
lymphoma, 87 (25%) were positive for Cps. Approximately 90% of the OAL specimens that were positive
for Cps DNA (94 of 104 specimens) came from just 3
of the 11 studies included in this meta-analysis, and
the rate of Cps positivity among the specimens in
those studies was 35%. In stark contrast, the rate of
Cps positivity in the other 8 studies was only 7% (14
of 194 specimens).
There was much geographic variation in Cps
positivity (Table 2). Rates of Cps positivity varied
even between studies from the same region. For
example, the rate was 80% in the first study published by Ferreri et al.,7 41% in a subsequent study
by Ferreri et al.,19 and only 10% in another study by
Chanudet et al.16 The rate was 24% in 1 of the U.S.
series16 and 0% in the other 2 American reports,8,15
and was 33% in 1 Dutch series16 and 0% in the
other.10

Efficacy of Antibiotics for the Treatment of OAL
We found 4 studies published between April 2004
and October 2006 regarding the efficacy of antibiotics
for the treatment of OAL (Table 3).17–21 These studies
included 42 patients: 27 patients (64%) from Italy, 11
patients (26%) from Austria, 3 patients (7%) from the
U.S., and 1 patient (2%) from Taiwan. There were 16
men and 26 women. The patients ranged in age from
18 to 87 years (median, 60 years). Forty-one patients
were treated with doxycycline at a dose of 200 mg
per day for at least 3 weeks. One patient in the study

by Abramson et al.17 was treated with a PrevPak (lansoprazole at a dose of 30 mg, amoxicillin at a dose of
500 mg, and clarithromycin at a dose of 500 mg)
twice a day for 14 days. The median follow-up time
after antibiotic treatment was 11.5 months.
In the study by Ferreri et al.,19 Cps status was
verified via touchdown enzyme time-release PCR,
and all 11 of the 27 patients (41%) were found to be
Cps positive. 19 In the study by Yeung et al., the 1
patient was negative for Cps by serology.20 The study
by Grunberger et al.21 did not include testing for Cps
status. In the study by Abramson et al., all 3 patients
were negative for Cps by serology.17 Of the 19
patients who were negative for Cps (16 by PCR and 3
by serology), 9 (47%) were reported to have achieved
a response to antibiotics (4 patients achieved a complete response and 5 achieved a partial response).
Eight (19%) of the 42 patients with OAL who
were treated with antibiotics achieved a complete
response, 8 patients (19%) achieved a partial response, 4 patients (10%) achieved a minimal response, 20 patients (48%) had stable disease, and 2
patients (4%) developed progressive disease. Overall,
22 patients (52%) experienced either no improvement or a worsening of disease, whereas 20 patients
(48%) experienced some improvement. Seven additional patients in the study by Ferrari et al. developed disease recurrence after an initial response or
initial stable disease after antibiotic treatment, with
86% of the recurrences occurring during the first 12
months of follow-up.19
The distribution of responders across geographic
areas was as follows: all those patients with complete
and partial responses were reported in the Italian
(81%) and U.S. studies (19%). The 1 patient in the
Taiwanese study achieved a minimal response at 6
months after antibiotic treatment. All 11 patients in
the Austrian study had stable disease at 9 months.
Objective radiographic evidence of response to
antibiotic treatment was provided for only 3 of the
42 patients, all of whom were reported by Ferreri
et al.18,19

DISCUSSION
Our findings in these 2 meta-analyses suggest that
there is significant variation in the prevalence of Cps
DNA in OAL specimens and that this prevalence varies by geographic region and is not as high as
reported in the early studies of this association. The
current study findings further suggest that oral antibiotics are not effective against the majority of cases
of OAL and indicate that the majority of reports in
the literature of a positive response of OAL to anti-

biotics are not accompanied by objective documentations of response.
Overall, approximately 23% of OAL specimens
had PCR evidence of Cps DNA. There was a great
deal of variability between geographic regions and
even between studies from the same geographic
region with regard to the prevalence of Cps positivity.
The highest Cps positivity rate was reported by Ferrari et al. in their first article, which reported an
overall Cps positivity rate of 80%.7 In a more recent
article, the same authors reported a much lower rate
of Cps positivity (41%).19 The Korean study by You
et al. reported a Cps positivity rate of 78%.10 However, 2 other studies of Asian patients have reported
much lower rates. Daibata et al.13 reported a rate of
0% in Japanese patients, and Chanudet et al.16
reported a rate of 11% among Chinese patients. Variability in the methodology used to detect Cps DNA
may be a possible explanation for the wide variability
observed in Cps positivity rates.
Another explanation for the wide variability in
Cps positivity rates could be that the presence of Cps
DNA is not etiologically related to the occurrence of
OAL and thus the variability observed is simply a
reflection of the variability in exposure to Cps on the
conjunctival surface or other ocular adnexal structures. Exposure to infected birds and cats is a risk
factor for psittacosis, a lung infection caused by Cps.
In the initial study by Ferreri et al., contact with
household animals was reported in 13 patients,7 all
of whom were positive for Cps. In the same study, 14
patients with OAL also had chronic conjunctivitis; 12
of these patients had PCR evidence of Cps DNA. It is
difficult to estimate the prevalence of Cps DNA in
ocular adnexal tissue in healthy adults; arriving at
such an estimate would require random sampling of
ocular adnexal tissue collected from large populations of healthy adults, and to our knowledge this
has not been done to date. In addition, it most likely
would not be ethical. Estimates of the incidence of
psittacosis are available, but this is not indicative of
the asymptomatic presence of Cps DNA on the ocular adnexal tissue. A rough estimate of the annual
incidence of psittacosis is 1 in 17 million people in
the U.S., 1 in 3 million in the U.K., 1 in 3 million in
France, 1 in 3 million in Italy, 0 in 16 million in the
Netherlands, 1 in 4 million in Germany, 1 in 76 million in China, 1 in 7 million in Japan, 1 in 1 million
in North Korea, 1 in 2 million in South Korea, and 1
in 1 million in Taiwan.24 These numbers are based
on extrapolated statistics from the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia and do not take into account any
genetic, cultural, or environmental differences; therefore, these statistics may be highly inaccurate and

814

provide only general indications as to the actual total
incidence of psittacosis.
Yet another possible explanation for the variability in Cps DNA prevalence noted across the studies
may be that in all the studies reported to date, a potpourri of OAL histologic subtypes have been lumped
together and the results are not stratified based on
the histologic classification of the tumors. For example, it is possible that the prevalence of Cps DNA for
conjunctival MALT lymphoma would be quite different than that for Mantle cell lymphoma or diffuse
large cell lymphoma of the orbit or lacrimal gland.
The efficacy of antibiotics for the treatment of
OAL was also found to be quite variable across the 4
reports published to date. The 2 consecutive reports
by Ferreri et al.18,19 contained what to our knowledge
are the only 3 well-documented cases of an objective
response to antibiotics reported to date. These
patients had received prior treatment with interferon,
rituximab, radiation, or chlorambucil. The response
in some of the patients in the study by Ferrari et al.
was short-lived, with lymphoma recurring in 6 of 7
patients during the first 12 months after treatment
with antibiotics.19
To our knowledge, the only other study that
reported 2 patients with OAL who achieved complete
responses to antibiotic therapy was the study by
Abramson et al.17 Unfortunately, no photographs or
radiographic documentation of response was provided in this particular report. None of the other
reports included radiographic or clinical evidence of
response as documented by external or slit-lamp
photographs. In the study by Grunberger et al.,21
none of the 11 patients with OAL responded to antibiotic treatment with a follow-up of [9 months for
all patients; all 11 patients had achieved a complete
response after treatment with radiation or chemotherapy.
Judging the ‘‘response’’ of OAL can be problematic, and descriptions of response can be inaccurate
unless documentation is provided in the form of
imaging studies or photographs. Some patients with
ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma may have had
stable disease during antibiotic therapy simply because they had disease that was indolent enough
that the period of observation was not long enough
to permit documentation of any measurable progression. In other cases, particularly in cases of conjunctival MALT lymphoma, the disease load (lymphoma
load) might have been very small or immeasurable
because the bulk of the involved conjunctiva may
have been removed during the diagnostic biopsy.
Furthermore, the indolent nature and prolonged
time to progression of MALT lymphoma of the con-

junctiva may make the presence of ‘‘stable’’ disease
in response to antibiotic treatment meaningless.
Some authorities have even made the controversial
recommendation to offer no treatment for the ocular
component of this disease, given its indolent nature
and prolonged time to disease progression.25 It is
also possible and quite likely that the response
rate for conjunctival MALT lymphoma to any treatment modality may be quite different from that for
other forms of ocular adnexal lymphoma such as follicular, diffuse large cell, or mantle cell lymphoma;
therefore, grouping these lymphomas together in studies that assess the efficacy of antibiotics is not a
good strategy. A limitation of all studies of the efficacy of antibiotics for OAL published to date is that
there is no stratification of data based on the histologic subtype of OAL. The response rate to any treatment and progression-free survival may be quite
different for an indolent type of OAL such as conjunctival MALT lymphoma compared with a more
aggressive histologic type such as Mantle cell lymphoma of diffuse large cell lymphoma.
In summary, our 2 meta-analyses suggest a striking variability in the association between Cps and
OAL across geographic regions and even among different studies from the same geographic regions and
among studies published by the same group of
investigators over time. The findings of the current
study also suggest that antibiotics have relatively low
and variable efficacy in the treatment of OAL. The
variation in response to antibiotics, the lack of objective methods of assessment of response in the majority of reports published to date, the lack of stratification
of response rates based on histologic subtypes of
OAL, and the short follow-up times suggest an
unproven role for antibiotics in the treatment of
OAL. Prospective studies with standard objective and
measurable response criteria, a longer follow-up time,
and the stratification of patients based on their histologic subtype of OAL are needed to further clarify the
role of antibiotics in the treatment of OAL.
