Altered glucose metabolism in cancer cells is termed the Warburg effect, which describes
the propensity for most cancer cells to take up glucose avidly and convert it primarily to
lactate, despite available oxygen 1,2. Notwithstanding the renewed interest in the Warburg
effect, cancer cells also depend on continued mitochondrial function for metabolism,
specifically glutaminolysis that catabolizes glutamine to generate ATP and lactate3.
Glutamine, which is highly transported into proliferating cells4,5, is a major source for
energy and nitrogen for biosynthesis, and a carbon substrate for anabolic processes in cancer
cells, but the regulation of glutamine metabolism is not well understood1,6. Here, we report
that the c-Myc (or Myc) oncogenic transcription factor, which is known to regulate
miRNAs7,8 and stimulate cell proliferation9, transcriptionally represses miR-23a and
miR-23b, resulting in greater expression of their target protein, mitochondrial glutaminase
(GLS). This leads to up-regulation of glutamine catabolism10. GLS converts glutamine to
glutamate that is further catabolized through the TCA cycle for the production of ATP or
serves as substrate for glutathione synthesis11. The unique means by which Myc regulates
GLS reported herein uncovers a previously unsuspected link between Myc regulation of
miRNAs, glutamine metabolism, and energy and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
homeostasis.

Oncogenes and tumor suppressors have now been linked to the regulation of glucose
metabolism, thereby connecting genetic alterations in cancers to their glucose metabolic
phenotype1,2. In particular, the MYC oncogene produces Myc protein that directly regulates
glucose metabolic enzymes as well as genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis9,12. In
this regard, we sought to determine the role of the MYC in altering the mitochondrial
proteome to further understand regulation of tumor metabolism. We studied the human
P-493 B cells that bear a tetracycline-repressible MYC construct, such that tetracycline
withdrawal results in rapid induction of Myc and mitochondrial biogenesis, followed by cell
proliferation12,13. By comparing the mitochondrial proteome from tetracycline-treated and
untreated cells with high Myc expression, we found 8 mitochondrial proteins that are
distinctly differentially expressed in response to Myc (Figures 1a, 1b and Tables S1). We
note that mitochondrial glutaminase or GLS (MW∼58kDa) was increased ∼10-fold in
response to Myc. As such, we determined the response of glutaminase to Myc induction in a
time-course study using anti-GLS antibody10 (Figure 1c) and found that GLS levels
diminish with decreased Myc expression and recover upon Myc re-induction. However, the
level of the mitochondrial protein TFAM remained virtually unaltered. GLS levels also
correlate with Myc levels in another human B cell line (CB33) and one (CB33-Myc) with
constitutive Myc expression14. Since human prostate cancer is linked to Myc expression15,
we sought to determine whether reduction of Myc expression by siRNA in the human PC3
prostate cancer cell line was also associated with reduction of GLS expression (Figure 1d).
Similar to the human lymphoid cells, the PC3 cells also displayed a correlation between
Myc and GLS levels.
We then sought to determine whether the dramatic alteration of GLS levels in response to
Myc is functionally linked to Myc-induced cell proliferation. While there are two major
known tissue-specific GLS isoforms, GLS1 and GLS216,17, our data showed that only
GLS1 is predominantly expressed in P493-6 or PC3 cells (Figure S1). We first determined
whether gain of GLS1 function through overexpression in PC3 cells would rescue the

diminished growth rate associated with siRNA-mediated reduction of Myc (Figure S2) and
found that ectopic GLS1 expression alone is insufficient to stimulate growth. In light of the
observation that no single gene could substitute for Myc 18,19 and that Myc is a pleiotropic
transcription factor9, this outcome was not particularly surprising. As such, we reduced the
expression of GLS1 (herein referred to as GLS) by RNA interference (siGLS) and found
that P-493-6 cell proliferation is markedly attenuated by siGLS but not by control siRNA
(Figure 2a). Likewise, proliferation of the human PC3 prostate cancer cell line was
diminished by siGLS (Figure 2a), indicating that GLS is necessary for cell proliferation.

Because glutamine is converted by GLS to glutamate for further catabolism by the TCA
cycle and previous studies indicate that overexpression of Myc sensitizes human cells to
glutamine withdrawal induced apoptosis11, we determined the metabolic responses of
P493-6 or PC3 cells to glutamine deprivation (Figure 2b). The growth of both cell lines was
diminished significantly by glutamine withdrawal and moderately with glucose withdrawal.
Glutamine withdrawal also resulted in a decrease in ATP levels (Figure 2c) associated with
a diminished cellular oxygen consumption rate (Figures S3a and S3b). Reduction of GLS by
RNAi also reduced ATP levels (Figure 2d). Because glutamine is a precursor for
glutathione20, glutathione levels were measured by flow cytometry and were found
diminished with glutamine withdrawal or RNAi mediated reduction of GLS (Figure S4 and
Table S2) that is also associated with an increase in ROS levels (Figure S3c) and cell death
in the P493-6 cells (Figures 2e and S5). It is notable shortly after the MYC proto-oncogene
was discovered, that the MC29 retrovirus which bears the v-myc oncogene was found to
enhance glutamine catabolism and mitochondrial respiration in transplantable avian liver
tumor cells21. Thus, our findings functionally link historical observations with Myc,
glutaminase and glutamine metabolism.

Author Manuscript

Since GLS catabolizes glutamine for ATP and glutathione synthesis, its reduction affects
proliferation and cell death presumably through depletion of ATP and augmentation of ROS,
respectively. Hence, we sought to rescue the P493-6 cells with the TCA cycle metabolite
oxaloacetate (OAA) and the oxygen radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC)11. Both
OAA and NAC partially rescued the decreased proliferation and death of P493-6 cells
deprived of GLS (Figures 2e and S6). Likewise, OAA and NAC both partially rescued
glutamine-deprived P493-6 cells (Figures S5 and S6). These findings support the notion that
glutamine catabolism through GLS is critical for cell proliferation induced by Myc and
protection against ROS generated by enhanced mitochondrial function in response to
Myc11,20.

Author Manuscript

Given that GLS is critical for cell proliferation and is induced by Myc, we determined the
mechanism by which Myc regulates GLS. Because Myc is a transcription factor9, we
hypothesized that Myc transactivates GLS directly as a target gene. Despite the presence of
a canonical Myc binding site (5′-CACGTG-3′) in the GLS gene intron 1, GLS mRNA levels
do not respond to alterations in Myc levels in the P493-6 cells, suggesting that GLS is
regulated at the post-transcriptional level (Figure 3a). As such, we hypothesized that GLS
could be regulated by miRNAs that are in turn directly regulated by Myc. The TargetScan
algorithm predicts that miR-23a and miR-23b could target the GLS 3′UTR seed sequence.
Intriguingly, our earlier studies uncovered that both miR-23a and miR-23b are suppressed

by Myc in P493-6 cells7, and both miR-23s are decreased in human prostate cancers22,
which are associated with elevated Myc expression15.

Author Manuscript

To verify that miR-23a and miR-23b (herein referred to as miR-23) are suppressed by Myc
and could be diminished by antisense miR-23 locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligomers,
northern analysis was performed and miR-23 was suppressed by Myc and profoundly
diminished by antisense miR-23 LNAs (Figure 3b). Using quantitative real-time PCR, we
document (Figure S7) that miR-23 levels increased with diminished Myc expression and
then decreased upon Myc re-induction in a manner that is compatible with the GLS protein
levels seen in Figure 1c. We also found an inverse relationship between Myc and the levels
of miR-23a and miR-23b in the CB33 human lymphoid cells and PC3 prostate cancer cell
line (Figure S8). Furthermore, Myc directly bound the transcriptional unit, C9orf3,
encompassing miR-23b, as demonstrated for other Myc miRNA targets7 by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (Figure 3c). Because the transcriptional unit involving miR-23a has not
been mapped, we did not study miR-23a in this context. These observations document that
Myc represses miR-23a and miR23b, which appear to be directly regulated by Myc.

Author Manuscript

We determined next whether miR-23 targets and inhibits the expression of GLS through the
3′UTR. In this regard, we cloned the 3′UTR sequence of GLS including the predicted
binding site for miR-23 to the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector and transfected MCF-7 cells,
which is known to express miR-2323. The GLS 3′UTR inhibited luciferase activity in a
fashion that was blocked by co-transfection with the antisense miR-23 LNAs, but not with
control LNAs (Figure 3d). We next mutated the predicted binding site by a site-directed
mutagenesis strategy8 and observed that mutant 3′UTR did not inhibit luciferase activity as
the wild-type sequence did. Using these reporters in PC3 cells, we observed that siRNAmediated diminished Myc expression resulted in decreased luciferase activity with wild-type
but not with the mutant 3′UTR reporter (Figure S9). Most importantly, diminished GLS
protein level, which follows decreased Myc expression (Figure 1c), was rescued by
antisense miR-23 LNAs (Figure 3e). The antisense miR-23 LNAs also partially rescued the
diminished GLS level associated with RNAi-mediated reduction of Myc expression in the
PC3 cells (Figure 3e).

Author Manuscript

We also examined events upstream and downstream of GLS24 and found that the glutamine
transporter SLC7A5 is induced by Myc in P493-6 cells at the transcriptional level (5-fold by
nuclear run-on, unpublished data) with a >7-fold induction of its mRNA level. The
glutamine transporter ASCT2 is induced by Myc at the mRNA level by 2-fold, whereas
glutamate dehydrogenase mRNA levels appear unaltered (unpublished data). Furthermore,
we found that elevated levels of Myc protein in human prostate cancer correspond to levels
of GLS, which was not increased in the accompanying normal tissue from the same patients
(Figure S10). Intriguingly, miR-23a and miR-23b are significantly decreased in human
prostate cancer as compared with normal prostate tissue22. It is notable that loss of GLS
function by antisense suppression significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis of Ehrlich ascites
tumor cells in vivo25. Our findings here uncover a pathway by which Myc suppression of
miR-23, which targets GLS, enhances glutamine catabolism through increased
mitochondrial glutaminase expression. Taken together, these observations provide a
