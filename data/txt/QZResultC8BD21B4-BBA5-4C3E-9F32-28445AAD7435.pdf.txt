ABSTRACT
In many forms of cancer the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) transcription factor remains constitutively active, driving cancer survival and
progression. The critical role of STAT3 in tumorigenesis has prompted a campaign
of drug discovery programs to identify small molecules that disrupt the function of
STAT3, with more recent efforts focusing on direct STAT3 inhibition. There are two
target binding sites for direct STAT3 inhibitors: the SH2 dimerization domain and the
DNA-binding domain. An in vitro fluorescence polarization assay, using recombinant
STAT3 protein, has successfully identified compounds that target the SH2 domain;
however, no assay has been reported to identify inhibitors that bind the DNA-binding
domain. The lack of such a quantitative assay has limited the identification and
development of STAT3 DNA-binding domain inhibitors. Here, we report a modified
DNA-binding ELISA to incorporate recombinant STAT3 protein to evaluate small
molecules that prevent STAT3-DNA binding. The concomitant use of the ELISA and
fluorescence polarization assay enables the classification of direct STAT3 inhibitors
by their site of action. Our data provide further support that niclosamide inhibits
STAT3 through interaction with the DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, the ELISA
can support medicinal chemistry efforts by identifying DNA-binding domain inhibitors
and allowing the determination of an IC50 value, supporting the ranking of inhibitors
and development of structure-activity relationships. Therefore, we propose a tandem
evaluation approach to identify small molecules that target the SH2 domain or the
DNA-binding domain of STAT3, which allows for quantitative evaluation of candidate
STAT3 inhibitors.

9, 10]. In normal cells this process is transient; however,
in many solid and hematological cancers STAT3 remains
constitutively active, promoting tumor survival and
progression [5, 11]. This critical role in carcinogenesis
makes STAT3 as an attractive therapeutic target for
treating human malignancies [9, 10, 12, 13].
A number of strategies have been examined to
inhibit STAT3 activation, such as targeting the activating
JAK2 kinase; however, these broad-spectrum approaches
often result in off-target effects [10, 12, 14, 15]. Therefore,
there has been recent interest in direct inhibition of
STAT3, and this has mainly focused on targeting the
SH2 dimerization domain [14, 16]. The SH2 domain is
the location of the activating Tyr705 residue and is the

INTRODUCTION
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) is a member of the STAT family of transcription
factors that regulate many cellular processes including
cell growth and survival, and immune response [1–3].
The activation of STAT3 is mediated through the binding
of cytokines and growth factors that stimulate a signaling
cascade resulting in the phosphorylation of Tyr705 within
the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of STAT3, and the
formation of active homodimers [4–8]. Active STAT3
dimers translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
where they bind DNA and induce transcription of genes
involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival [4,

protein-protein interface responsible for the formation of
transcriptionally active STAT3 dimers (Figure 1). Small
molecules designed to target this domain, such as S3I-1757
(Figure 2), aim to disrupt the protein-protein interaction
of the SH2 domains of activated STAT3 monomers [12].
Due to the difficulty in developing small molecules
capable of disrupting protein-protein interactions over a
large surface area, while maintaining drug-like properties,
there are a limited number of SH2 domain inhibitors that
have reached pre-clinical and clinical trials [10, 15, 17,
18]. Stattic was one of the first small molecule inhibitors
of STAT3 to be identified [10, 19], and it was initially
believed to be a SH2 domain inhibitor; however, it was
later determined that its inhibitory activity was due to
modification of the protein through covalent interactions
with cysteine residues, many of which reside in the DNAbinding domain (DBD) of STAT3 (Figures 1B and 1C) [20,
21]. Therefore, there has been interest in developing small
molecules that disrupt STAT3 transcriptional activity by
targeting the DBD of STAT3 (Figure 1) [22–24]. To date,
few small molecules have been reported as STAT3 DBD
inhibitors, due to the lack of an efficient in vitro screening
assay, hindering the drug discovery process. It has been
proposed that niclosamide, an anthelmintic drug, inhibits
the ability of STAT3 to bind DNA [24], and the pyrrolone
based compounds A18 and A26 have been reported as

STAT3 DBD inhibitors [23] (Figure 2). Targeting this
domain may prove more successful in abrogating STAT3
activity in cancer, as these compounds have the potential
to inhibit STAT3 transcriptional activity regardless of
dimerization status [10]. This prospective success may be
due in part to the ability of unphosphorylated STAT3 to be
transcriptionally active [18, 25, 26], and the observation
that inhibition of active STAT3 dimers alone may not be
sufficient in modulating STAT3 activity [23].
The cell-based assays used to evaluate STAT3
inhibition with small molecules include the STAT3dependent dual luciferase reporter assay [27, 28],
electromobility shift assay (EMSA) [22, 24, 26], and
measuring expression of gene targets downstream of
STAT3 signaling [23, 29]. These assays effectively
evaluate the inhibitory potential of small molecules
against STAT3 signaling; however, they provide little
to no information regarding their site of action or if
the inhibition is a direct result of STAT3 inhibition
[10]. For the purposes of STAT3 inhibitor design and
development, these cell-based methods of evaluation are
uninformative without in vitro assays with the capacity to
determine direct inhibition of STAT3-DNA binding, the
potency of inhibition, and the site of interaction. The in
vitro fluorescence polarization (FP) assay, developed by
Schust and Burg [30], allows for rapid identification of

small molecule inhibitors of recombinant STAT3 acting
at the SH2 domain. Although the FP assay is capable
of identifying STAT3 inhibitors that act at the SH2
domain, it does not identify small molecules that target
the DBD of STAT3. Nkansah et al., have demonstrated
that unphosphorylated STAT3 (uSTAT3) is capable of
binding its corresponding DNA sequence using a protein
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (PEMSA), supporting
the use of recombinant STAT3 for the evaluation of DBD
inhibition; however, small molecule inhibitors were not
evaluated via this method [26]. In this manuscript we
introduce a modified in vitro DNA-binding STAT3 ELISA
as part of a tandem evaluation approach to elucidate and
quantitatively assess small molecule inhibitors that target
either the SH2 dimerization domain or the DBD of STAT3.

with an IC50 of 7.39 ± 0.95μM in the FP assay (Figure
3B). Both compounds A18 and A26 have been reported
as DBD inhibitors of STAT3 [23]. A18 demonstrated no
activity in the FP assay; however, A26 exhibited robust
inhibition with an IC50 value of 0.74 ± 0.13μM (Figure
3C). Niclosamide has also been proposed to target STAT3;
however, its mode of action has not been confirmed
although suggested to target the DBD. From our results,
niclosamide does not interact with the SH2 domain at
concentrations up to 600μM (Figure 3C). The compounds
that demonstrate no activity in the FP assay (up to 50μM)
require an alternative in vitro assay to determine if they
exhibit inhibitory action on the DBD of STAT3.

RESULTS

The STAT3 DNA-binding ELISA can be used to
evaluate the ability of STAT3 in cellular nuclear extracts
to bind its corresponding consensus sequence that has
been immobilized on a 96-well plate [31, 32]. Addition
of full-length, recombinant monomeric STAT3 to the
TransAM STAT3 ELISA resulted in a concentrationdependent increase in optical density (OD). These results
demonstrate that OD (y) exhibited a linear correlation with
the concentration of STAT3 (x), given by the equation y
= 3.120x+0.1525 (Figure 4A). The in vitro ELISA results
demonstrated that recombinant STAT3 had measurable
binding activity and suggested that incorporating
recombinant STAT3 into the assay may allow for more

The STAT3 inhibitors S3I-1757 and A26 bind the
SH2 domain of STAT3 in an FP assay
The FP assay assesses the ability of a compound to
bind the SH2 domain of recombinant STAT3 and disrupt
fluorescein-labeled peptide binding [30]. Stattic inhibits
STAT3 activity via cysteine alkylation [21] and despite a
cysteine residue residing in the SH2 domain (Cys687), we
did not detect any disruption of STAT3-peptide binding
with stattic up to 600μM (Figure 3A). S3I-1757 has been
reported as an SH2 domain inhibitor of STAT3 and our
results support that S3I-1757 can bind the SH2 domain
and prevent protein-protein interactions at this interface,

extracts served as a protein loading guide based on OD.

Quantification of STAT3-DNA binding in nuclear
extracts

Stattic, S3I-1757, and niclosamide inhibit
recombinant STAT3-DNA binding in a DNAbinding ELISA

Using the equation obtained in the previous section,
we quantified STAT3 in nuclear extract samples that bound
the DNA consensus sequence immobilized on the ELISA
plate. The TransAM STAT3 ELISA kit provides prepared
nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells stimulated with IL-6 (100
ng/mL). The average OD recorded for the recommended
5μg total protein of HepG2 nuclear extracts was 0.793,
equating to an average STAT3-DNA bound content
of 0.21μg (Figure 4B), although there was substantial
variability among the different samples. The average OD
recorded for 20μg total protein of HeLa nuclear extracts was
0.532, equating to an average STAT3-DNA bound content
of 0.12μg (Figure 4B). Based on data consistency, HeLa
cells were used for the evaluation of inhibitors in cell-based

Recombinant STAT3 was incorporated into a
STAT3-DNA binding ELISA to determine small molecule
binding and disruption of STAT3-DNA binding (Figure
5D). The cysteine alkylator stattic inhibited STAT3DNA binding with an IC50 of 1.27 ± 0.38μM (Figure
5A). S3I-1757, which also demonstrated affinity for the
SH2 domain, inhibited STAT3-DNA binding with an
IC50 value of 0.31 ± 0.18μM (Figure 5C). A26 and A18
demonstrated weak inhibition of STAT3-DNA binding
at concentrations greater than 10μM and no IC50 values
could be determined (Figure 5B). Niclosamide exhibited
inhibition of STAT3-DNA binding with an IC50 of 1.93
± 0.70μM, supporting its site of action as the DBD of

STAT3 (Figure 5B). The compounds that demonstrate
activity in the FP assay but not the ELISA prevent STAT3
dimerization, those that have activity in the ELISA assay
but not the FP assay prevent direct interaction of STAT3
with DNA, and compounds that have activity in both the
ELISA and the FP assay are mixed mode inhibitors. Once
the mode of STAT3 inhibition is known compounds can
then be evaluated in cell-based assays, even compounds
that demonstrate no activity in the FP or ELISA assays
could be tested in the cell-based assays to determine

measures the ability of activated STAT3 present in nuclear
extracts to bind to its corresponding DNA consensus
sequence [31–34]. Therefore, an ELISA performed on
cellular nuclear extracts allows for the evaluation of
compounds that target the SH2 domain and/or the DBD
of STAT3. STAT3 inhibitory potential of the compounds
was assessed by incubating HeLa cells at concentrations
capable of decreasing cell viability by 50% as determined
by MTT, followed by preparation of nuclear extracts to
evaluate by ELISA. Stattic and A26 did not alter STAT3DNA binding at their respective EC50 concentrations
(Figure 6B). In contrast, both A18 and niclosamide
reduced STAT3-DNA binding compared to control (55%
and 75%, respectively) (Figure 6B). An EC50 of 0.19 ±
0.001μM was determined from a dose-response curve for
niclosamide in analysis of nuclear extracts in the ELISA
(Figure 6C).

± 1.3μM, and niclosamide 1.09 ± 0.9μM (Figure 6A).

action. Inhibitors of STAT3, particularly those that target
STAT3-DNA binding, have been evaluated using cellbased assays, but the results of these assays can be difficult
to interpret as the mode of action of the compound and the
manner in which it directly or indirectly affects STAT3
cannot be determined via these methods. Furthermore,
IC50 values for compounds tested in cell-based assays vary
between assay and cell-type and may not be representative
of the effects of STAT3 inhibition alone [10]. Therefore,
the expansion of in vitro assays available to evaluate
direct STAT3 inhibition and inhibitor mode of action
is critical for medicinal chemistry efforts focused on
the advancement of STAT3 inhibitor identification and
development.
A well-established method for evaluating small
molecule inhibitors of the SH2 domain is the FP assay
[30]. This competitive binding assay uses monomeric
recombinant STAT3 and a fluorescent peptide that has
high affinity for the STAT3 SH2 domain [30]. Small
molecules targeting this domain impair the binding of
the peptide, leading to a change in fluorescence based on
free versus bound peptide. In the FP assay, stattic did not
present any observable activity against the SH2 domain
up to 600μM. Cys687 within the SH2 domain and both
Cys367 and Cys468 within the DBD, are all potential
targets for stattic and alkylation within the DBD may
be the primary mechanism of action of stattic-mediated
STAT3 inhibition [21, 35]. The lack of inhibition of stattic
at the SH2 domain may be due in part to the inability of
stattic to disrupt the protein-peptide interaction through
the alkylation of Cys687 alone. Similarly, the steric
bulk of stattic may be insufficient to disrupt STAT3
dimerization. S3I-1757 has been reported as a STAT3 SH2
domain inhibitor and has previously been evaluated in a
FP assay [17]. The IC50 of 7.39 ± 0.95μM value obtained
from our FP assay data, is in good agreement with values
reported in the literature [17], and S3I-1757 served as a
positive control for this assay. Both A18 and A26 have

been reported as DBD inhibitors [23], but the activity of
A18 or A26 has not been previously reported in the FP
assay and, as expected, A18 exhibited no inhibition in
the FP assay. Interestingly, despite significant structural
similarities with A18, A26 demonstrated good affinity
for the SH2 domain with an IC50 value of 0.74 ± 0.13μM.
Previous studies utilized immobilized A26 in a protein
pull-down experiment with various domain deletions of
recombinant STAT3 protein to determine the DBD was the
binding site of A26. The results of our FP assay suggest
that this compound may have a bimodal mechanism of
action with the capacity to bind both the SH2 and DBD
sites of STAT3. In contrast, the mechanism of STAT3
inhibition by niclosamide had previously been proposed to
be due to targeting the DBD based on results from EMSA
analysis [24]. Our results further support that niclosamide
does not have substantive affinity for the SH2 domain and
exerts its inhibitory effects via interaction with the DBD,
preventing DNA binding and subsequent transcriptional
activation.
It has previously been confirmed that recombinant
STAT3 can bind to DNA and the interaction of uSTAT3
with DNA is similar to the binding orientation of
active pSTAT3 [26]. The recombinant STAT3 ELISA
results demonstrated the suitability of this assay to both
determine the binding of recombinant STAT3 protein and
identify potential inhibitors of STAT3-DNA binding. The
capability of full-length recombinant STAT3 to bind its
corresponding consensus DNA sequence immobilized on
an ELISA plate allows the estimation of the amount of
activated STAT3 bound to DNA in nuclear extract samples.
Using the concentration of STAT3 quantified in HeLa
nuclear extracts as a guide, compounds were evaluated for
their DNA-binding inhibitory activity against monomeric
recombinant STAT3 in the modified ELISA. The
compounds selected in our study inhibit STAT3 activity
with differing modes of action and display inhibition of
STAT3 in STAT3-dependent luciferase reporter assays [17,

23, 24, 36]. Although assay conditions are not uniform
across publications, all compounds examined in our study
reduced STAT3 transcriptional activity to varying degrees.
Stattic alkylates cysteine residues in the DBD
of STAT3 [21, 35], resulting in the decreased activity
observed in the recombinant protein ELISA. S3I-1757
also showed potent activity in the ELISA against STAT3
monomers and this may be due to S3I-1757 having a
bimodal mechanism of action, acting at both the SH2
domain and DBD. Niclosamide, A18, and A26 have
been suggested as DBD inhibitors, yet only niclosamide
demonstrated appreciable activity in the recombinant
protein ELISA assay. Our results indicate that A18 and
A26 do not effectively inhibit STAT3 via binding to the
DBD. A26 exhibited potent activity in the FP assay and
little activity in the in vitro ELISA at concentrations up
to 50μM. In contrast to previous reports, A18 had no
observable activity in either the FP or the in vitro ELISA
assays up to 10μM, suggesting the mechanism of action
of A18 is not a result of direct STAT3 inhibition, despite
structural similarity to A26. Since the in vitro ELISA
using monomeric recombinant STAT3 does not rely on the
formation of STAT3 dimers, the primary use of this ELISA
method is to identify potent inhibitors that target the DBD
as opposed to the SH2 domain of STAT3, when used in
combination with the FP assay. Structural analysis studies
using X-ray crystallography may further confirm the
interaction of niclosamide at the DBD; however, there are
only 3 crystal structures (PDB ID: 4E68 [26], 3CWG [37],
and 1BG1 [38]) of the core STAT3 fragment containing
the SH2 domain and DBD currently deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and no STAT3inhibitor co-crystal structures are present, suggesting that

the resolution of the STAT3 crystal structure is not a trivial
endeavor.
The MTT assay was used to determine the
maximum concentration of compound that could be
used in cells prior to the preparation of cellular nuclear
extracts without depleting cell numbers such that
isolated protein concentrations reside outside of those
required for detection in the ELISA assay. Dosing cells
at a concentration greater than the EC50 would result in
too few cells remaining to produce the required 20μg
of total protein in the nuclear extracts. Although stattic
demonstrated inhibition of STAT3-DNA binding in the
ELISA using recombinant STAT3, no inhibition was
observed in the ELISA using nuclear extracts, possibly
due to the non-specific cysteine alkylation of other
cellular proteins. S3I-1757 has previously displayed
high micromolar activity in cells [17], and no EC50 could
be determined from the MTT assay (data not shown).
Therefore, S3I-1757 was not advanced forward for the
evaluation of STAT3 inhibition by ELISA in HeLa cells.
A18 induced a ~55% reduction in STAT3-DNA binding
at its MTT derived EC50 of 12μM while A26 displayed no
significant activity at the corresponding concentration of
6μM. Results reported for a STAT3 EMSA in H1299 cells
is consistent with a 50% reduction of STAT3-DNA binding
for A18 at 12μM and no reduction in binding for A26 at
6μM [23]. The lack of activity of A18 in the FP assay and
the in vitro ELISA using recombinant STAT3, but activity
in the cell-based ELISA supports a mode of action other
than direct STAT3 inhibition (Figure 7). This highlights
the need for cell-free systems to evaluate direct STAT3
inhibitors, as cell-based assay can provide confounding
results, where compounds may have direct or indirect

activity in the FP assay and ELISA using recombinant STAT3 protein should also be evaluated in cell systems, such as the ELISA that

effect on STAT3. Niclosamide demonstrated potent
inhibition of STAT3 in the cell-based ELISA with an EC50
of 0.19 ± 0.001μM. The increased potency of niclosamide
in the cell-based ELISA suggests that niclosamide may
also target other members upstream of STAT3, resulting
in a greater impact on STAT3-DNA binding. This is
further supported in the literature, as niclosamide has
been investigated for its anticancer activity in additional
signaling cascades many of which crosstalk with the
STAT3 signaling pathway [39–42].
Taken together, our data support that the FP assay
and ELISA using recombinant STAT3 can serve as an
effective quantitative approach to identify potent direct
inhibitors of STAT3 acting at the SH2 dimerization
domain or the DBD (Figure 7). The use of the FP assay
and the recombinant STAT3 ELISA has a number of
advantages over cell-based methods: 1) it allows the
identification of direct STAT3 inhibitors, 2) by using both
assays the site of interaction can be determined, and 3) the
assays provides dose-response and IC50 data for STAT3
inhibitors allowing an evaluation of inhibitory potency;
therefore, compounds can be ranked and structure-activity
relationships (SARs) can be established. Furthermore, the
data obtained from the ELISA using nuclear extracts from
HeLa cells provides initial support that STAT3 inhibitors
targeting the DBD are more efficient than those targeting
the SH2 domain in cellular systems. In this study we have
established an approach for identifying DBD inhibitors of
STAT3 and our data strongly supports that niclosamide
targets the DBD of STAT3. Although niclosamide was
not designed or developed as a STAT3 inhibitor, it may
provide a structural basis for the development of more
selective STAT3 inhibitors targeting the DBD.

plates (Corning). Fluorescent peptide 5-FAM-G(pTyr)
LPQTV-CONH2 (Genscript) was added to each assay
well at a concentration of 10 nM. Final well volumes were
30μL. Following incubation with fluorescent peptide for
30 minutes at room temperature with mild agitation, plates
were examined using FP Fluorescein Dual module with
excitation filter FITC FP 480 and emission filter FITC FP
P-pol535 and S-pol535. Data was expressed as percent
control using the equation %C = (mPdrug-mPfree)/(mPSTAT3mPfree)*100 where mP is the value for FP measurement.

Recombinant STAT3 ELISA
Measurement of STAT3 binding to DNA was
performed using a TransAM STAT3 ELISA kit (Active
Motif). The TransAM STAT3 ELISA kit provides
oligonucleotides containing the STAT3 consensus
binding sequence immobilized on the ELISA plates.
The kit was utilized according to product directions
with the replacement of cellular nuclear extracts with
recombinant STAT3 protein. Full-length, GST-tagged
recombinant human STAT3 protein (abcam) was
incorporated into the TransAM STAT3 ELISA kit in
increasing amounts (0.01μg–1.0μg). To each well to
be used, 30μL of Complete Binding Buffer was added.
To the sample wells was added recombinant STAT3
diluted in 20μL of Complete Lysis Buffer and the plate
was incubated at room temperature with mild agitation
for 1 hour. A blank well containing 20μL of Complete
Lysis Buffer was also included. Following the 1 hour
incubation, wells were washed 3 times with 200μL
of 1X Wash Buffer and then incubated with STAT3
antibody (1:1000 dilution) in 100uL of 1X Antibody
Binding Buffer for 1 hour without agitation. Wells
were washed 3 times with 200μL of 1X Wash Buffer
and incubated with HRP-conjugated antibody (1:1000
dilution) in 100uL of 1X Antibody Binding Buffer for
1 hour without agitation. Finally, wells were washed
4 times with 200μL of 1X Wash Buffer and then
developed using room-temperature Developing Solution
for 15 minutes. Stop Solution was added and the plate
was immediately read for absorbance at 450 nm with
reference wavelength at 655 nm on a microplate reader.

were incubated for 24 hours. Media was then aspirated
and replaced with 100μL of media containing various

for 10 minutes prior to reading absorbance at 540 nm in
a microplate reader. Data was normalized and reported
as percent of control.

Nuclear extract preparation
Nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear
extraction kit (Signosis) according to product directions.
Briefly, 100 mm dishes of cells were washed with 1X PBS
and then 1 mL of 1X Buffer I was added and dishes were
rocked on ice for 10 minutes. Cells were released from the
dish using a sterile scraper and centrifuged at 1200rpm for
5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the
pellets were resuspended in 1X Buffer II and shaken on
ice for 2 hours. Samples were centrifuged at 1200rpm for
5 minutes at 4°C and the resulting supernatants containing
the nuclear extracts were placed in new microcentrifuge
tubes. Protein concentrations of samples were determined
via Bradford assay.

HeLa cells were plated at 1 million cells per 100 mm
dish and incubated for approximately 72 hours, resulting
in serum-starved confluent plates. Plates were then
washed with PBS and fresh media was added containing
concentrations of A18, A26, stattic, or niclosamide for 24
hours. Cells were treated with compound concentrations
derived from their 24 hour MTT assay EC50 value. The
dose-response of niclosamide was similarly prepared at
concentrations ranging from 1.0μM-0.0675μM. Following
incubation with compounds, cellular nuclear extracts were
prepared.
Measurement of STAT3 binding to DNA was
performed using the TransAM STAT3 ELISA kit. Sample
wells contained 20μg of nuclear extracts from treated
HeLa cells diluted in 20μL of Complete Lysis Buffer.
The ELISA was then performed as described in the
recombinant ELISA section. Data was normalized and
reported as percent of control.
