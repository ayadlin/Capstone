ABSTRACT
The therapeutic strategies against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have hardly
been modified over four decades. Although resulting in a favorable outcome in young
patients, older individuals, the most affected population, do not respond adequately
to therapy. Intriguingly, the mechanisms responsible for AML cells chemoresistance/
susceptibility are still elusive. Mounting evidence has shed light on the relevance
of proteolytic systems (autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system, UPS), as
well as the AMPK pathway, in AML biology and treatment, but their exact role is
still controversial. Herein, two AML cell lines (HL-60 and KG-1) were exposed to
conventional chemotherapeutic agents (cytarabine and/or doxorubicin) to assess the
relevance of autophagy and UPS on AML cells’ response to antileukemia drugs. Our
results clearly showed that the antileukemia agents target both proteolytic systems
and the AMPK pathway. Doxorubicin enhanced UPS activity while drugs’ combination
blocked autophagy specifically on HL-60 cells. In contrast, KG-1 cells responded in
a more subtle manner to the drugs tested consistent with the higher UPS activity of
these cells. In addition, the data demonstrates that autophagy may play a protective
role depending on AML subtype. Specific modulators of autophagy and UPS are,
therefore, promising targets for combining with standard therapeutic interventions
in some AML subtypes.

INTRODUCTION

individuals have limited application, commonly due to
the high toxicity [4, 5]. Of note, despite the efforts to
understand AML and the considerable progress in the
therapy, this disorder is still fatal to two-thirds of young
adults and 90 % of older adults that develop the disease
[6]. Thus, the elucidation of the mechanism(s) underlying
leukemia cell’s response to chemotherapy is of utmost
importance for the development of new strategies,
targeting specific molecular alterations that perturb AML
cell’s survival pathways.
The conventional therapy for AML patients during
induction relies mainly on high doses of cytarabine in

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly
heterogeneous clonal disorder comprising the most
common acute leukemias in adults [1-3]. This disease
is characterized by an impairment in myeloid cellular
differentiation with accumulation of immature myeloid
progenitor cells in the bone marrow [1-3]. Hence, AML
heterogeneity is reflected by the diversity of myeloid
precursors susceptible to malignant transformation.
To date, AML therapeutic schemes result in
favorable outcomes for young patients but, among old

combination with an anthracycline, such as doxorubicin
[7]. Both drugs induce a DNA damage response [8, 9]
that once activated may lead to LKB1 (Liver kinase B1)
and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) activation
[10-12]. The LKB1-AMPK pathway is a key sensor of
the cellular energy status that is also responsible for the
activation of critical survival mechanisms. This pathway
has been implicated in cancer cell biology [13] mainly as
a tumor suppressor axis [14-19]. In hematopoietic cells,
LKB1-AMPK has been demonstrated to be critical for
the maintenance of energy homeostasis [20]. Therefore,
its modulation is viewed as a promising novel treatment
option for some types of hematological malignancies
[13, 14, 20, 21]. Interestingly, LKB1-AMPK is also
involved in the regulation of protein degradation through
direct and indirect mechanism affecting the two main
proteolytic systems, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
and macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) [22,
23]. The relevance of both proteolytic systems on cancer
biology and particularly on hematological malignancies
has been widely recognized [24-27]. Inhibition of UPS is
already an attractive target for therapeutic interventions in
different cancers including hematological malignancies.
Bortezomib, a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like
activity of UPS, was already approved for the treatment
of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and mantle
cell lymphoma [28-30]. Although it has been shown that
AML cells are more susceptible to UPS inhibition than
non-neoplastic cells, their response is dependent on the
AML subtype [31].
Importantly, autophagy may act as a “double-edged
sword” in cancer [32]. In early tumorigenesis, it seems to
be cancer preventing, however, in an established tumor,
autophagy might help cancer cells to survive under
stress. Under prolonged cytotoxic treatments, autophagy
enhancement may act as a cancer resistance mechanism
[33] and can be activated in response to DNA damaging
agents, counteracting their action by avoiding cell death
[26]. Particularly in AML chemotherapy, autophagy
was described as reducing the activity of daunorubicin,
obatoclax and vitamin D3 [34-36]. Furthermore, recent
evidence suggests that autophagy acts as a pro-survival
signal in t(8;21) AML cells [37] and, in accordance,
a dual inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 leads to
an autophagy induction with consequent increase of
AML cells survival [38]. In contrast, AZD8055, a dual
inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 and a strong inducer
of autophagy, decreases AML blast cell proliferation
suggesting that autophagy might be contributing for
cell death [39]. In agreement, the reduction of TRAF6
protein, promoted by bortezomib or protein knockdown,
is associated to autophagy induction and subsequently
with apoptosis of AML cells [40]. Therefore, although the
autophagic process is emerging as a crucial player and a
promising therapeutic target in AML [26], its exact role is
still controversial.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Autophagy has also been shown to be regulated by
the LKB1-AMPK pathway. This energy sensing pathway
is known to be involved in complex interplays with
mTORC1 and both have been suggested to have opposite
effects on the regulation of this catabolic process [41].
Clinical trials using autophagy and UPS
inhibitors for the treatment of different hematological
malignancies are already ongoing, however, the results
are still inconclusive and further investigation is required
(reviewed in [42]).
Given the still controversial role of UPS, autophagy
and AMPK pathway on survival/death of AML blasts,
this work focused on evaluating the relevance of these
processes on AML cells’ response to anti-leukemia agents.
The results obtained with two AML cell lines highlighted
the heterogeneous and specific nature of the different AML
subtypes, in what concerns the relevance of AMPK and
the proteolytic systems in response to chemotherapeutic
agents. Chemotherapy regime promotes in HL-60 cells
an increase of UPS activity that leads to extensive
AMPK degradation, which among others effects, results
in autophagy inhibition. In KG-1 cells these effects are
discreet and most probably related to the specific features
displayed by these cells such as high UPS activity.
Altogether, the results show that these survival pathways
are promising targets for therapeutic intervention in some
AML subtypes and have to be considered in association
with standard chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Toxic effects of cytarabine and doxorubicin on
AML cell lines
To get new insights into the mechanisms underlying
resistance/susceptibility of AML cells to cytarabine and
doxorubicin, human AML cells derived from patients
diagnosed with FAB M2 (HL-60 cell line) and FAB M6
- erythroleukemia (KG-1 cell line) were exposed to these
chemotherapeutic agents for 18 h, 24 h and 48 h. Two
concentrations of cytarabine were used: 10 µM, the most
commonly used cytarabine concentration for human AML
cell lines in in vitro assays [43-45] and 1000 µM, to mimic
chemotherapeutic regimens consisting of high cytarabine
concentrations [46, 47]. Regarding doxorubicin, the
half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were used
(Table 1). The results showed that cytarabine alone only
has a drastic impact on AML cells survival for longer
incubation periods (Figure 1), which is in agreement with
the commonly used 7 days perfusion therapeutic schemes.
Moreover, for the treatment time periods analyzed, the
100-fold increase in the cytarabine concentration had no
effect on HL-60 or KG-1 cells’ death rate, measured by
MTS and annexin V/PI assays (Figure 1). Concerning

doxorubicin, the concentrations chosen induced around
40 to 60 % cell death in both cell lines (Figure 1). As
expectable, exposure of HL-60 and KG-1 cells to the
combination of the two chemotherapeutic agents for the
same incubation periods resulted in enhanced loss of cell
viability in a time-dependent manner, compared to the
individual treatments (Figure 1).
Of note, the comparison of the cell survival
percentages obtained by MTS and annexin V/PI assays
showed a good correlation between both methodologies
for KG-1 cells (Figure 1C and Figure 1D) but not for HL60 cells, particularly in treatment conditions involving
doxorubicin (Figure 1A and Figure 1B). Previous studies

reported that doxorubicin affects mitochondrial activity
on HL-60 cells [48], which may be responsible for the
different results obtained with the two methods on this
cell line and highlight the need to carefully interpret the
data using MTS to evaluate cell viability in this particular
condition and the usefulness of using more than one assay
to evaluate cell viability/survival.

[49]. The data showed that, in HL-60 cells, the
combination of the antileukemia agents induced a marked
increase of H2AX phosphorylation, when compared
with untreated cells (Figure 2A). In contrast, no major
alterations of H2AX phosphorylation were observed when
KG-1 cells were exposed to the same treatment (Figure
2B). In fact, KG-1 cells displayed high basal levels of
H2AX phosphorylation (Figure 2B), a phenomenon also
documented by Boehrer et al. upon exposure of KG-1
cells to different doses of irradiation [50]. Therefore, to
further elucidate whether the combination of cytarabine
and doxorubicin induced DNA damage in KG-1 cells, a
Terminal dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay was
performed. The results clearly showed an increase in the
percentage of TUNEL positive cells (from about 8 % in
untreated cells to 65 % in cells treated with chemotherapy
agents), confirming the induction of DNA damage by

(cytarabine and doxorubicin) on DNA damage, we

important marker of DNA damage response activation

cytarabine and doxorubicin in KG-1 cells (Figure 2C and
Figure 2D).
To investigate whether DNA damage response lead
to AMPK activation [10-12], the levels of phosphorylated
AMPK (Thr172, the residue phosphorylated in response to
DNA damage) and total AMPK protein were determined
by immunoblotting analysis. Our data demonstrated
that HL-60 cells presented high basal levels of total and
phosphorylated AMPK, in comparison to KG-1 cells
(Figure 2E and Figure 2F), which suggests a constitutive
activation of this pathway in HL-60 cells.
Interestingly, the cytarabine plus doxorubicin
treatment resulted in a marked decrease of total AMPK
protein levels in both cell lines, when compared with
untreated cells. Of note, such decrease was more evident
in HL-60 cells (Figure 2E and Figure 2F). According to
the literature, the AMPK pathway is critically involved in
the regulation of proliferation and survival of leukemia
cells [14]. In agreement, our data also suggests AMPK as
an important survival pathway in AML cells that seems

to be targeted by the combination of cytarabine and
doxorubicin.

Doxorubicin induces UPS activation on AML cell
lines
Recent studies have highlighted that UPS might
directly or indirectly regulate AMPK activity [51]. To
elucidate whether UPS was responsible for the observed
AMPK degradation, under chemotherapeutic agents’
exposure (Figure 2E and Figure 2F), UPS activity was
determined. The results indicated that KG-1 cells present
a higher basal level of UPS activity, when compared to
HL-60 cells (Figure 3A). However, in the presence of
doxorubicin (alone or combined with cytarabine), the
condition where the AMPK levels are evidently reduced
(Figure 2E, Figure 2F, Figure 3D and Figure 3E), a
significant increase in UPS activity was detected in
both cell lines (Figure 3B and Figure 3C). Of note, the

Figure 3: Doxorubicin induces UPS activation on AML cell lines. HL-60 and KG-1 (A) UPS basal levels were quantified by the

measurement of the chymotrypsin-like activity. Additionally, HL-60 (B) and KG-1 (C) cells were incubated, for 18 h, with bortezomib (an
UPS inhibitor used as negative control), cytarabine and/or doxorubicin. After the treatment period, the UPS activity was quantified using
the approach referred above. The results were obtained by comparing the treated with non-treated cells and mean+/-SEM of three intraassay replicates are shown. One-way ANOVA and Turkey’s Multiple Comparison Test were used to compare the non-treated group with
the treated groups. *p <0.05; **p <0.01. Additionally, AMPK and S6K (mTORC1 substrate) activation were evaluated by immunoblotting
analysis of phosphorylated (Thr172) and total AMPK protein levels and phosphorylated (Thr389) and total S6K protein levels, respectively,
after 18 h of treatment on the HL-60 (D, F) and KG-1 (E, G) cell lines. The arrangement of the AMPK gels is represented separately due
to the presence of other conditions between the bands of interest. Nevertheless, all conditions were assessed in the same gel. Legend: B –

Combined antileukemia agents impact on
autophagy activity of AML cell lines, particularly
HL-60 cell line

increased UPS activity was much more pronounced in HL60 cells than in KG-1 cells, the cell line that displayed
the higher basal levels of UPS activity (Figure 3A, Figure
3B and Figure 3C). Furthermore, the observation of
less AMPK degradation in KG-1 cells treated with the
chemotherapeutic agent, when compared with HL-60
cells in the same conditions, could be associated with
the lower enhancement of UPS activity observed when
KG-1 cells are subjected to doxorubicin (Figure 3B and
Figure 3C). Consistently with the specific degradation of
AMPK by UPS, our results showed that the combination
of the antileukemia agents also promoted a decrease of the
protein levels of the mTOR substrate S6K in both HL-60
and KG-1 cell lines (Figure 3F and Figure 3G). Altogether,
the results obtained showed that AML cell lines have
distinct basal levels of UPS activity and that doxorubicin
is effectively targeting AMPK for degradation.

Given the increased UPS activity observed in
response to doxorubicin in AML cells (Figure 3B and
Figure 3C), we investigated the involvement of autophagy,
the other main proteolytic system, on AML cell’s response
to chemotherapy. For such purpose, autophagy flux
was assessed by the immunoblotting analysis of LC3
processing and of p62 levels (also known as SQSTM1),
an autophagy substrate [52]. The results showed that both
cell lines present similar basal autophagic activity levels
that increase over treatment time (controls from Figure
4A, Figure 4B, Figure 4D and Figure 4E). Interestingly,
a similar increase in the AMPK basal levels over the
course of the experiment was also observed (Figure 2E
and Figure 2F), which is consistent with the central role of

Figure 4: Combined antileukemia agents impact on autophagy activity of AML cell lines, particularly in HL-60 cells.

HL-60 (A, B) and KG-1 (D, E) cells were incubated for 18 h, 24 h (only for KG-1 cells) and 48 h, with cytarabine and doxorubicin and
after the treatment period, the autophagy activity was assessed using immunoblotting analysis of LC3 processing (I and II) and p62. All
samples were incubated 2 h before the end of the treatment with bafilomycin A1 (10 nM), in order to block the autophagy flow and to allow
the accumulation of LC3-II. Densitometric analysis of LC3 protein levels in HL-60 (B) and KG-1 (E) cells was performed using the ratio
LC3 II/Actin. The bands were quantified in Quantity One® software and the results represent six independent biological replicates. Oneway ANOVA and Turkey’s Multiple Comparison Test were used to compare the all the group conditions.*p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.
Additionally, LC3 A/B-I/II puncta levels were assessed by immunofluorescence assay after 18 h of treatment. HL-60 (C) and KG-1 (F)
cells were staining to Goat LC3 anti-Rabbit IgG antibody (green fluorescence) and samples were counter-stained with the DNA dye DAPI
(blue fluorescence). Representative images of immunofluorescence assay are presented. Bar=20 µm. Legend: C+D - cytarabine combined

Modulation of autophagy affects AML cells
viability

the AMPK pathway on the regulation of autophagy [53].
As expected, a decrease in p62 levels was also observed
in a time dependent manner (Figure 4A and Figure 4D).
The cytarabine/doxorubicin combined treatment caused
a drastic decrease of autophagic levels in HL-60 cells,
observed by the clear reduction of LC3 II levels in the
immunoblotting analysis (Figure 4A and Figure 4B). This
observation is supported by the evident increase of p62
levels and decrease of LC3 puncta observed in these cells
(Figure 4A and Figure 4C). In contrast, for KG-1 cells, the
combination of the antileukemia agents did not promote
any major impact on autophagy up to 24 h of treatment
(Figure 4D and Figure 4F). Nevertheless, a clear reduction
of both LC3 I and LC3 II levels, as well as of p62 levels,
was evident after 48 h of treatment with cytarabine and
doxorubicin (Figure 4D and Figure 4E), a phenomenon
that was not observed in HL-60 cells (Figure 4A and
Figure 4B).
The data showed that the combination of cytarabine
and doxorubicin is efficient in targeting and inhibiting
autophagy in HL-60 cells but they can only promote a
similar effect on KG-1 cells for long time period (48 h,
Figure 4D and Figure 4E), highlighting that the behavior
of the proteolytic systems in response to chemotherapy is
highly dependent on AML subtype.

To further clarify the role of autophagy on AML
cells’ response to chemotherapy, the impact of its
modulation on the viability of HL-60 and KG-1 cells
exposed to cytarabine and doxorubicin was determined.
For such, bafilomycin A1, an autophagy inhibitor, and
compound C, an efficient pharmacological AMPK
inhibitor [54] that is also an indirect autophagic activator
were used. The results showed that addition of bafilomycin
A1 together with cytarabine and doxorubicin has a
discrete effect on the viability of AML cells, although
it is more pronounced on KG-1 cells (Figure 5A and
Figure 5C). Nevertheless, the combination of compound
C, an autophagy inducer/activator, with cytarabine and
doxorubicin promoted a statistically significant increase
in HL-60 and KG-1 cells’ viability (Figure 5B and Figure
5D). Although the use of indirect autophagy modulators
has important limitations, altogether the results clearly
showed that induction of autophagy promotes cell
survival.

results were obtained using the non-treated cells as control (100 %) and mean+/-SEM of, at least, six biological replicates are shown.

DISCUSSION

KG-1 cells in 20S proteasome previously described [31].
Altogether, the data suggests that doxorubicin leads to
increased UPS activity, resulting in the degradation of
critical cellular signal transducers and effectors such as
AMPK and S6K, a downstream target of mTORC1 that in
turn could also be regulated by the AMPK pathway [60].
These findings are highly relevant in the context of the
antitumoral action of doxorubicin, suggesting that AMPK
and mTORC1 are important targets of this drug. The
results also suggest that UPS activity is important on AML
cell’s response to doxorubicin and that cells with higher
UPS activity, KG-1 cells, are more resistant to doxorubicin
(as shown by the higher IC50 value).
Autophagy is another crucial cellular proteolytic
system of eukaryotic cells that, together with UPS, plays a
crucial role on protein catabolism and cellular homeostasis
[61]. Our findings, when assessing the effect of the two
chemotherapeutics’ combination in the autophagic activity,
clearly demonstrated the differential response of the
two cell lines analyzed. The exposure of HL-60 cells to
cytarabine and doxorubicin caused an autophagy blockage,
accompanied by a drastic reduction of the AMPK levels.
In the KG-1 cell line, however, the combination of these
drugs did not significantly impact the autophagic activity,
neither led to AMPK degradation in such a significant
manner.
The exact role of autophagy in cancer development/
treatment is still controversial. In AML disorders, recent
evidence suggests that autophagy acts as a pro-survival
signal in t(8;21) AML cells [37], however the exact role of
this process in the different subtypes of this hematologic
malignancy is still unclear. Our data on autophagy after
treatment and the modulation of this proteolytic process
clearly demonstrates the crucial role of autophagy as a
pro-survival mechanism in AML cells. Nevertheless,
autophagy seems to be targeted by cytarabine and
doxorubicin combination in HL-60 cells only. Our
results imply that, in this cell line, the combination
of drugs leads to autophagy blockage or autophagy
players’ and regulators’ degradation. In addition, the
data clearly highlights the relevance that proteolytic
systems might have on cells response to chemotherapy
and the heterogeneity of the response of AML subtypes
to conventional chemotherapy. In accordance, examples
of heterogeneity in responses to drugs, leading to the
activation of different cell death mechanisms, including
autophagy, have been recently described as being
dependent on the leukemia subtype, in T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [62].
In summary, this study highlights the relevance of
the proteolytic systems and one of their major regulators,
AMPK, on AML cells response to chemotherapy, which
suggests that specific modulators of AMPK activity and
the autophagy and UPS systems may be promising targets
for therapeutic intervention in AML. The association of
such modulators to standard therapeutic strategies could

chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the treatment
of AML [7, 55]. This therapeutic scheme has hardly
progressed over the last 40 years in spite of its low
efficiency rates and limited application among old
individuals and high levels of resistance displayed by
AML cells to the drugs [5]. Cytarabine and doxorubicin
are well known inducers of DNA damage [56, 57] and the
impact of these agents on DNA damage was confirmed
on HL-60 and KG-1 cells in the conditions described.
Exposure of both cell lines to the combination of the two
chemotherapeutic agents induced a clear enhancement
of H2AX phosphorylation (in HL-60 cells) and a drastic
increase in the percentage of TUNEL positive cells (in
KG-1 cells). KG-1 cells were shown to display a high
constitutive level of H2AX phosphorylation. The role
of histone H2AX in malignant transformation/cancer
development is still not totally clear and novel functions
for phosphorylation of histone H2AX, in addition to DNA
damage repair, have already been shown, including the
induction of its phosphorylation through proliferation
signaling pathways [58], which could occur in the case
of KG-1 cells.
Although most anticancer therapies rely mainly
on agents that affect the machinery required for DNA
replication to induce cell death [59], over the last years,
different studies have highlighted that chemotherapeuticsinduced DNA damage can also lead to the activation of
AMPK, a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis
[15-17]. Comparison of basal AMPK activity levels
of the two cell lines studied suggested an association
between AMPK and the tumorigenicity of the HL-60
cells. Notably, the cytarabine and doxorubicin treatment
induced a marked reduction of total AMPK levels that
is consistent with the increased activity of proteasome.
This phenomenon is clearly evident in HL-60 cells but
not in KG-1 cells. Therefore, our data clearly rules out
the hypothesis of AMPK activation being an AML cell
survival mechanism activated by the chemotherapeutic
agents but instead suggests that it could be part of the
tumorigenic process of HL-60 cells.
Previous studies reported that UPS could regulate
AMPK activity by inducing its ubiquitination and
consequent degradation [51]. Our data is consistent with
this hypothesis since an increase in UPS activity was
associated with the AMPK degradation observed on both
cell lines when exposed to doxorubicin. Of note, the
lower AMPK degradation in KG-1 cells treated with the
chemotherapeutic agent, when compared with HL-60 cells
in the same conditions, could then be associated with the
lower enhancement of UPS activity observed when KG-1
cells are subjected to doxorubicin. Moreover, the basal
UPS activity of KG-1 cells was found to be higher than
in HL-60 cells in accordance with the higher content of

actually allow the reduction of the chemotherapeutics’
doses, therefore reducing their toxicity. Identification of
specific molecular mutations or altered mechanisms and
appropriate use of this knowledge to the development
of targeted therapies is recent in the treatment strategy
of AML. The best studied potential targets are FMS like
tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and Janus
kinase (JAK-2) [63]. Based on the findings described
in this paper, the heterogeneous response of the AML
subtypes to the therapy commonly used corroborates with
the strong rationale for the development of different and
specific therapeutic schemes to apply to AML patients,
dependent on the molecular abnormalities of each subtype.
Specifically, our data suggests the AMPK pathway
and both proteolytic systems might be strong potential
candidates. Nevertheless, future studies to dissect and
confirm this data should be performed in primary AML
samples.

100 μl of the cells’ suspension was then transferred to 96well plates and 10 µL of MTS solution (1.90 mg/ml) were
added to each well followed by incubation in a humidified,
37 ºC, 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Absorbance at 490 nm was
recorded after 2 h of incubation. Blank controls detecting
cell-free RPMI + drug and RPMI absorbances were
performed in parallel. At least six biological replicates
were prepared.

Measurement of cell viability – Annexin V and PI
analysis
HL-60 and KG-1 cell lines were plated at 350.000
cells/700 μl per well and collected at 18 h, 24 h and 48 h
of treatment (or control). The cells were then washed with
800 µl of PBS and 100 µL of binding buffer was added
to each sample. An incubation with 5 µL of annexin V
(BD Biosciences®) and with 10 µL of Propidium iodide
(PI) at 50 µg/ml (Invitrogen®) was performed for 15 min
at room temperature, in the dark, and 200 µL of binding
buffer were added once again. PI signals were measured
using the FACS LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences®)
with a 488 nm excitation laser. The annexin V signal was
collected through a 488 nm blocking filter, a 550 nm
long-pass dichroic with a 525 nm band pass. Signals from
10.000 cells/sample were captured and FACS Diva was
used as the acquisition software. Results analysis was
performed using the FlowJo 7.6 (Tree Star®) software. The
results represent, at least, six biological replicates.

METHODS
Cell culture
The HL-60 (FAB M2) and KG-1 (erythroleukemia
– FAB M6) cell lines were obtained from the German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell cultures (DSMZ®
- Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen - German). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Biochrom® - Merck Millipore) supplemented
with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum – FBS
- (Biochrom® - Merck Millipore) and 1 % antibioticantimycotic mixture (Invitrogen®) in a humidified, 37 ºC,
5 % CO2 atmosphere. Cells in exponential phase of growth
(passages 5 to 20) were used.

Western blot analysis
Protein extraction was performed with 50 µL of
lysis buffer (1 % NP-40, 500 mM Tris HCL, 2.5 M NaCl,
20 mM EDTA, Phosphatase and Protease inhibitors - from
Roche® -, at pH 7.2) 18 h, 24 h and 48 h after HL-60 and
KG-1 cell lines were exposed to treatment (or control). 20
µg of the total protein were resolved in a 12 % SDS gel and
transferred to a Nitrocellulose membrane for 7 or 15 min
in Trans-Blot Turbo® transfer system. Membranes were
blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1 %
tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5 % skim milk Molico® and
afterwards incubated overnight at 4 ºC, with the polyclonal
primary antibodies at 1:1000 in 1 % BSA (Bovine Serum
Albumin) - Rabbit anti-histone H2AX Antibody; Rabbit
anti-phospho-histone H2AX (Ser139) Antibody; Rabbit
anti-AMPKα Antibody; Rabbit anti-phospho-AMPKα
(Thr172) Antibody; Rabbit anti-p70 S6K Antibody;
Rabbit anti-phospho-p70 S6K Antibody (Thr389); Rabbit
anti-LC3A/B Antibody (all from Cell-Signaling®); Rabbit
anti-p62 Antibody (Sigma-Aldrich®) and Mouse anti-Actin
antibody (Millipore®). After washing with tris-buffered
saline-tween (TBS-T), membranes were incubated with
the corresponding secondary antibodies - IgG anti-Mouse
for Actin (Chemicon International®) and IgG anti-Rabbit

Treatments
Cytarabine, doxorubicin and compound C were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich® and were dissolved in
dH2O. Bafilomycin A1 was also purchased from SigmaAldrich® but prepared in DMSO. Bortezomib was
obtained from Santa Cruz® and was prepared in dH2O. The
concentrations used for each drug are described in Table 1.

Measurement of cell survival – MTS assay
Cell viability of HL-60 and KG-1 cells was assessed
using the Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (MTS), acquired from Promega®. HL60 and KG-1 cell lines were plated at 350.000 cells/700 μl
per well and exposed to the different drug combinations.
The number of viable cells in culture was determined at
18 h, 24 h and 48 h of treatment exposure (or control).

for all the others (Cell-Signaling®), at 1:5000 in 1 % skim
milk for 2 h at room temperature. Protein levels were
detected after incubation with SuperSignal® West Femto
Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific®)
or Clarity® Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad®). Digital
images of the western blotting were obtained in a
‘ChemiDoc XRS System’ (Bio-Rad®) with Quantity One
(Bio-Rad®) software. At least, six independent biological
replicates were performed.

HL-60 or KG-1 cells (30.000 cells/plate) were
resuspended in PBS, after 18 h under treatment, and were
fixed in a slide by cytospin technic. After this, fixation
was performed in PFA 2 %. Cells were then washed,
permeabilized and blocked with 4 % BSA in PBS 0.05
% Tween. Incubation with primary antibody, Rabbit
anti-mouse LC3 A/B (Cell-Signaling®), was executed
overnight, at 4 °C. Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488
- green-fluorescent dye - (Molecular Probes®) was used
as secondary antibody. Cells were also stained with DAPI
(4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) that binds regions in
DNA, marking the cell nuclei. Three biological replicates
were used. An epifluorescence microscope (BX61
microscope with an Olympus DP70 camera) was used to
slide visualization and then images were analyzed with
ImageJ® Software (National Institutes of Health).

TUNEL analysis
The cytospin technique was performed to fixe
50.000 HL-60 or KG-1 cells/plate, after 18 h of treatment
(or control). Cells were fixed (PFA 4 %), washed and
permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 in 0.1 % sodium
citrate for 7 min on ice. The Terminal dUTP Nick-End
Labeling (TUNEL) analysis was performed using the “In
Situ Cell Death Detection” kit, Fluorescein (Roche®)
following the manufacter‘s instructions. Cells were also
stained with PI (Invitrogen®), binding DNA regions.
Three independent biological replicates were used. An
epifluorescence microscope (BX61 microscope with an
Olympus DP70 camera) was used for slide visualization
and then the images were analyzed with ImageJ® Software
(National Institutes of Health).

Statistical analysis
All data is reported as the mean ± standard error
of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed
using the student’s t-test and the one-way ANOVA test.
Multiple comparison test was used as Post-Hoc test to
denote significant differences between groups untreated,
groups subjected to drugs and respective combinations.
Additionally, the two-away ANOVA and Bonferroni post
hoc tests were also used to compare the non-treated group
with the treated groups and respective combinations for
annexin V/PI approaches. A p-value lower than 0.05 was
assumed to denote a significant difference.

Proteolytic activity of Ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS)
“Proteasom-GloTM Cell-Based Assays” (Promega®)
was used to measure the proteolytic activity of the
UPS. It comprises a luminescent assay that measures
the chymotrypsin-like activity associated with the
proteasome complex in cells [64]. Chymotrypsin-like
(SUC-LLVY-Glo subs) was chosen as a proteasome
subtract. Proteasome-Glo™ Cell-Based Reagents were
both prepared and equilibrated at 22°C for 30 min before
use. The luminescence was measured in a luminometer
“Fluoroskan Ascent FL” by ThermoScientific. 350.000
cells (HL-60 or KG-1) were diluted in 700 µl of RPMI
1640 medium containing 10 % FBS and 1 % antibiotic
with treatments and equilibrated in an incubator with
controlled % of CO2 (5 %), temperature (37 °C) and
humidity. After 18 h of treatment (or control), 25.000
cells were plated in a 96-well opaque plate, comprising a
volume of 100 µl. This was combined with “ProteasomGloTM Cell-Based Assays” (100 µl), the assay plate was
equilibrated at 22 °C, and after incubation during 5 to 30
min, a luminescent signal was obtained.
