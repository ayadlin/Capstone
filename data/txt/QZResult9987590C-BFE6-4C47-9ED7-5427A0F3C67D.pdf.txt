ABSTRACT
Triapine, an anticancer thiosemicarbazone, is currently under clinical
investigation. Whereas promising results were obtained in hematological diseases,
trials in solid tumors widely failed. To understand mechanisms causing triapine
insensitivity, we have analysed genomic alterations in a triapine-resistant SW480
subline (SW480/tria). Only one distinct genomic loss was observed specifically in
SW480/tria cells affecting the phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene locus. Accordingly,
pharmacological inhibition of PDE4D resulted in significant triapine resistance in
SW480 cells. Hence, we concluded that enhanced cyclic AMP levels might confer
protection against triapine. Indeed, hyperactivation of both major downstream
pathways, namely the protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP response element-binding protein
(Creb) and the exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac)-Ras-related protein 1
(Rap1) signaling axes, was observed in SW480/tria cells. Unexpectedly, inhibition of
PKA did not re-sensitize SW480/tria cells against triapine. In contrast, Epac activation
resulted in distinct triapine resistance in SW480 cells. Conversely, knock-down of
Epac expression and pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 re-sensitized SW480/tria
cells against triapine. Rap1 is a well-known regulator of integrins. Accordingly,
SW480/tria cells displayed enhanced plasma membrane expression of several integrin
subunits, enhanced adhesion especially to RGD-containing matrix components,
and bolstered activation/expression of the integrin downstream effectors Src and
RhoA/Rac. Accordingly, integrin and Src inhibition resulted in potent triapine resensitization especially of SW480/tria cells. In summary, we describe for the first time
integrin activation based on cAMP-Epac-Rap1 signaling as acquired drug resistance
mechanism. combinations of triapine with inhibitors of several steps in this resistance
cascade might be feasible strategies to overcome triapine insensitivity of solid tumors.

R2 subunit. The latter comprises a tyrosyl radical within
an iron-containing center essential for the enzymatic
activity [3]. Consequently, iron depletion in cancer cells
leads to deoxyribonucleotide deprivation and further to
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, iron-chelating
drugs have been developed as targeted anticancer drugs.
Several prominent representatives belong to the class of
thiosemicarbazones (TSC) [1], with 3-aminopyridine2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (triapine or 3-AP)

deoxyribonucleotides is the rate-limiting step during
DNA synthesis catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase

as the best studied example. While promising results
for triapine were obtained in clinical studies concerning
hematological diseases [2, 4], the one in solid tumors
widely failed [5-8]. However, the mechanisms underlying
triapine insensitivity of solid tumors are widely unknown.
Intrinsic and acquired anticancer drug resistance
might be based on overexpression of ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) drug efflux pumps causing a phenomenon
termed multi-drug resistance (MDR). With regard to
ABC-transporters, others and we have shown that
triapine-selection might cause ABCB1 (also known
as P-glycoprotein) overexpression [9, 10]. However,
triapine accumulation was not reduced significantly in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells and ABCB1 inhibition
failed to significantly re-sensitize towards triapine. This
argues against ABCB1 as a major triapine-resistance
factor [10]. Alternatively, drug resistance might be
based on hyperactivation of different survival and antiapoptosis pathways. One of the involved molecules,
attracting increasing attention during the last years,
represents cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP,
cAMP) [11]. cAMP is one of the most abundant second
messengers regulating various physiological processes
like cell survival, differentiation, proliferation and
apoptosis [12]. cAMP is catalyzed from ATP via adenylate
cyclase activated by G protein-coupled receptors [13].
The negative regulators of cAMP belong to the family
of phosphodiesterases (PDE), especially PDE4, which
hydrolyze cAMP to AMP [14, 15]. Enhanced cAMP
signaling has recently been identified as a major player
in resistance to cytotoxic drugs, but also for example in
vemurafenib therapy failure of BRAF-mutant melanoma
[11].
One major downstream target of cAMP is cAMPdependent protein kinase A (protein kinase A, PKA)
[16], a serine/threonine kinase consisting of two
catalytic and two regulatory subunits [17]. Binding of
the second messenger to the regulatory subunits leads
to dissociation of the complex and the free catalytic
subunits phosphorylate a variety of proteins [18]. One
PKA substrate is the transcription factor cAMP-responsive
element-binding protein (Creb). Subsequent, Creb binds
as homo- or heterodimers to cAMP-responsive elements
within target gene promoters [19], thus activating
transcription of several growth and survival genes
including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor
(MITF) [20], bcl-2 [21], and cyclin D1 [22].
Besides PKA, another downstream target of cAMP,
namely exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac),
was more recently discovered [23]. Epac acts as cAMPactivated Rap guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for the
GTPase Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1), which it activates
independently of PKA [24]. Rap1 signaling leads to
various cellular responses including integrin-mediated
cell adhesion [25], as well as activation of the mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathway [26], Src [27],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and downstream GTPases of the Rho/Rac family via a
crosstalk between Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
[28]. Accordingly, Almahariq et al. have shown that Epac
plays an important role in pancreatic cancer cell migration
and invasion via altered integrin expression [29].
In the present study, we have uncovered a key
role of the cAMP signaling pathway in acquired triapine
resistance. An Epac-Rap1-integrin survival program was
identified as the responsible downstream mediator. These
findings offer the chance for synergistic combination
treatment schemes involving triapine.

RESULTS
Genomic characterization of triapine-resistant
SW480 cells
A triapine-resistant SW480 subline (SW480/
tria) was generated as described by Miklos et al [10].
Cytotoxicity assays were performed to prove insensitivity
against triapine (Figure 1A) and a >56-fold resistance (at
IC50) in comparison to the parental cell line was detected.
To identify molecular factors contributing to triapine
resistance, genome wide gene dose changes (gains or
losses) were analyzed by direct and indirect aCGH. While
multiple chromosomal changes were obvious in the
parental cell line (Supplementary Figure S1A), indirect
aCGH of SW480/tria versus SW480 cells indicated that
triapine selection induced only minor further DNA dose
changes (Supplementary Figure S1B). Distinct genomic
gains in SW480/tria as compared to the parental cells
were completely missing. In contrast, the resistant subline
harbored a specific loss at chromosome 5q12 (Figure
1B). The deleted region affected only one gene, namely
phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). As expected, gene loss
resulted in massive downregulation of the respective
PDE4D mRNA (Figure 1C) and protein expression
(Figure 1D).

PDE4D inhibition protects against triapine in
parental SW480 cells
Consequently, we hypothesized that PDE4D
augments triapine-mediated anticancer activity probably
via down-regulation of cAMP. To support this assumption,
we investigated whether the small molecule PDE4
inhibitor rolipram protects SW480 cells against triapine.
Indeed, cell viability assays (72 h exposure) proved
that PDE4 inhibition by rolipram resulted in decreased
sensitivity of SW480 cells (Figure 2A) as well as HCT116 cells (Supplementary Figure S2A) to triapine. In
contrast, no significant effects were seen in the already
triapine-resistant SW480/tria cells (Figure 2B). Long-term
colony formation assay (10 days exposure) confirmed
this protective effect in parental SW480 cells already
at a lower triapine concentration (0.5 μM; Figures 2C,

variants, are shown. Normalized values for two replicates of SW480 and SW480/tria cells indicate massive downregulation of PDE4D
mRNA in the SW480/tria as compared to the parental cell line. Raw values depict the absolute dye intensity (Cy3 or Cy5) measured for the

2D and Supplementary Figures S2B, S2C). As triapine
is a known ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor [30], we
further analysed the cell cycle distribution in the drug
combination setting. Interestingly, the almost complete
S-phase arrest induced by 0.5 μM triapine in SW480 cells
was distinctly abolished by rolipram (Figure 2E). While
reduction of the G2/M subpopulation by triapine was also
detected in SW480/tria cells, the massive S-phase arrest
was missing. Furthermore, co-treatment with rolipram
only marginally reversed the G2/M-phase loss induced by
triapine (Figure 2F).

response selectively in SW480 but not in SW480/tria
cells (Figure 4B). Accordingly, Epac knock-down by
siRNA (Supplementary Figure S4A) led to significant resensitization of the resistant subline to triapine, whereas no
effect was seen in the parental SW480 cells (Figure 4C).
In addition to overexpression, Rap1 was clearly hyperactivated in the triapine-resistant subline (Supplementary
Figure S4B). Furthermore, triapine treatment led to a
further increase of Rap1 expression levels in SW480/tria
but not in parental SW480 cells (Figure 4D). Rap1 needs
to be prenylated for correct localization and activation
[31]. Accordingly, deprenylation of Rap1 as a consequence
of mevalonate pathway inhibition by zoledronic acid led to
higher amounts of deprenylated Rap1 in SW480/tria cells
especially when co-administered with triapine (Figure
4D). SW480/tria cells were slightly but significantly
hypersensitive against zoledronic acid as a single drug in
comparison to the parental cell line (Supplementary Figure
S4C). Furthermore, Rap1 inhibition by zoledronic acid
resulted in re-sensitization of SW480/tria cells to triapine
but had almost no impact in parental cells (Figure 4E).
This synergistic effect was confirmed by combination
index values <0.8 especially in the resistant cell model
(Supplementary Figure S4D). These data strongly indicate
that triapine resistance is mediated at least in part via the
cAMP-Epac-Rap1 signal axis.

The cAMP-PKA-Creb signal axis is not a major
regulator of PDE4D-promoted triapine response
One of the major cellular signaling pathways
activated by cAMP is the PKA-Creb module [16].
Therefore, we investigated whether alterations in the
cAMP-PKA-Creb pathway were responsible for triapine
resistance mediated by PDE4D loss. Indeed, stimulation
of cAMP with forskolin significantly attenuated triapine
response in SW480 cells but not in the triapine-selected
subline (Figure 3A). Forskolin as single drug did not
markedly alter viability of SW480 cells but slightly
reduced the one of SW480/tria cells (Supplementary
Figure S3A). Furthermore, hyperactivation of PKA in
SW480/tria cells compared to the parental cell line was
demonstrated by a strong hyperphosphorylation of PKA
substrates (Figure 3B). More specifically, expression of
the major PKA downstream transcription factor Creb was
slightly enhanced and its activating phosphorylation at
serine 133 massively increased in the triapine-resistant
subline (Figure 3C). Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition
of the PKA/Creb signal by PKA inhibitor H-89 should resensitize SW480/tria cells against triapine. The inhibitor
alone had no major influence on cell viability in both cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S3B). Surprisingly, however,
co-application with H-89 did not significantly sensitize
SW480/tria cells against triapine and even tended to
protect the parental cell line (Figure 3D) despite clear-cut
reduction of Creb phosphorylation in both cell models
(Supplementary Figure S3C). This demonstrates that the
PKA-Creb signal axis is not the major player involved in
cAMP-mediated triapine resistance.

Epac-Rap1-mediated triapine resistance involves
integrin alterations
Next, we aimed to clarify how the Epac-Rap1
signaling cascade mediates triapine resistance. Therefore,
we investigated the role of integrins, major downstream
targets of Rap1 [32], in acquired triapine resistance.
Expression of several integrin α and β subunits was
analyzed by Western blot in plasma membraneenriched fractions of SW480 as compared to SW480/
tria cells. The amounts of membrane-associated integrin
subunits αv, α5, β1 and β5 were distinctly enhanced
in SW480/tria as compared to SW480 cells (Figure
5A). Integrin β1 overexpression was also confirmed
by immunhistochemical staining in the SW480/tria as
compared to the SW480 xenograft in vivo (Supplementary
Figure S5A, S5B). Consequently, we analyzed the
impact of triapine treatment alone and in combination
with cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide and
integrin αv inhibitor [33], on integrin expression in our
resistance model using total protein lysates. Generally,
upregulation of integrin expression in the resistant subline
was somewhat lower but still distinct in the total protein
lysates as compared to the cell membrane fractions,
indicating more efficient cell membrane targeting of
integrins in the triapine-resistant subline (Figure 5B versus
5A, respectively). Interestingly, triapine exposure for 24 h
resulted in a selective and distinct up-regulation of integrin
α5 expression in both cell lines (Figure 5B). In contrast,

The cAMP-Epac-Rap1 signal axis distinctly
contributes to acquired triapine resistance
An alternative target of cAMP is Epac [23], a
guanine nucleotide exchange factor selectively activating
the Rap1 protein [24]. Therefore, we investigated
whether Epac and Rap1 are involved in acquired triapine
resistance. Indeed, both Epac and Rap1 were markedly
overexpressed in the triapine-resistant SW480 subline
(Figure 4A). Activation of Epac by the cell-permeable
activator 007-AM led to a massively reduced triapine

it had no further stimulatory effects on the expression
of integrin αv and the β-subunits. To investigate the
mechanisms underlying massive expression stimulation
of integrin α5 in response to triapine, real-time PCR
analyses for the respective ITGA5 mRNA were performed
(Supplementary Figure S5C). While upregulation of
ITGA5 mRNA was only about two-fold in SW480/tria as
compared to the parental SW480 cells, short-term triapine
exposure induced massive ITGA5 mRNA upregulation
in both cell models. This suggests that transcriptional
and post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in the
regulation of integrin expression/activity by triapine.
Integrin αv inhibition by cilengitide led to significant
triapine re-sensitization of SW480/tria cells, while no
synergism was detected in the parental cell line (Figure
5C; Supplementary Figure S5E). Additionally, SW480/
tria cells were per se hypersensitive towards cilengitide
when used as single drug (Supplementary Figure S5D). To
dissect the role of integrin α5 and αv in acquired triapine
resistance, combination experiments of triapine with
specific blocking antibodies for these integrin subunits
were conducted (Figure 5D and 5E). Interestingly,
both antibodies significantly reversed acquired triapine
resistance in SW480/tria cells but were widely inactive
in the parental cell model. Hence, we conclude that both
integrin α subunits play a pivotal role in acquired triapine
resistance.

blot analyses (Figure 6B; compare Figure 5B). Adherence
of both cell models to vitronectin was massively inhibited
by Rap1 blockade via zoledronic acid. Presence of triapine
abrogated this effect almost completely in the parental but
only marginally in the triapine-resistant subline (Figure
6B). This indicates dominance of the mevalonate pathway/
Rap1 signaling module in triapine-mediated regulation of
integrin dynamics in SW480/tria but not SW480 cells.

Possible downstream effectors of Epac-Rap1integrin-mediated triapine resistance
Ligand binding by integrin mediates activation of
multiple intracellular signaling pathways including MEK/
ERK, PI3K/AKT, and Src, as well as the downstream
GTPases RhoA and Rac [34]. To elucidate possible
mechanisms underlying Epac/Rap1/integrin-mediated
triapine resistance, regulation of these pathways by
triapine without and with cilengitide was investigated in
SW480 as compared to SW480/tria cells. Phosphorylation
of ERK, S6, and Src was used as indicator for activation
of the respective pathways (Figure 7A). While both
drugs and their combinations had massive impacts
on the phosphorylation of ERK, the alterations were
widely comparable between SW480 and SW480/tria
cells. Phosphorylation of S6 was enhanced in SW480/
tria cells as compared to the parental cell line. Triapine
as single agent induced S6 phosphorylation in SW480
but inhibited hyperphosphorylation in SW480/tria
cells. In both cell models cilengitide alone massively
blocked S6 phosphorylation whereas combination with
triapine restored PI3K/AKT pathway activity. The most
interesting differences were found in case of Src. Basal
phosphorylation was marginally reduced in SW480/
tria, compared to SW480 cells (Figure 7A). Triapine
significantly stimulated the level of p-Src in SW480/
tria cells while no effect was seen in the parental cells.
Cilengitide as single drug reduced Src phosphorylation
in SW480 and SW480/tria cells while combination of
both drugs resulted in enhanced Src phosphorylation
especially in the resistant subline. Moreover, the triapineresistant subline was moderately but significantly
hypersensitive against the Src-inhibitor dasatinib (Figure
7B). Furthermore, Src inhibition led to significant triapine
re-sensitization of SW480/tria cells (Figure 7C). The
synergistic effect of triapine and dasatinib co-exposure
was also confirmed by the respective combination
indices (Figure 7D). At low μM triapine concentrations,
however, dasatinib also re-sensitized the parental
SW480 cells against triapine (Supplementary Figure
S6). This indicates that Src phosphorylation is one player
underlying acquired as well as intrinsic triapine resistance.
Additionally, expression of two additional downstream
targets of integrins, namely the GTPases Rac and RhoA,
was investigated. Especially basal Rac expression was

Integrin-mediated cell adhesion is altered by
triapine selection
Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors
for ligands in the extracellular matrix leading to activation
of intracellular signaling cascades to promote adhesion,
migration, proliferation, and survival [34]. To further
elucidate altered integrin signaling in triapine resistance,
cell adhesion assays with SW480 and SW480/tria cells
were performed (Figure 6A). In accordance with the
increased expression of several integrin subunits, the
triapine-resistant subline was able to adhere moderately
but significantly more efficiently to uncoated cell culture
plastic as compared to the parental cell line. On surfaces
coated with ligands for RGD-binding integrins, namely
vitronectin and fibronectin, this difference was distinctly
enhanced. In contrast, adhesion to the BSA-coated surface
was unaltered in SW480/tria as compared to SW480 cells.
Blockade of integrins by cilengitide treatment resulted in
reduced cell adhesion efficacy to culture plastic as well as
vitronectin and fibronectin, while there was no significant
effect in case of BSA. These effects were stronger in the
resistant subline in case of the RGD-containing ligands.
Furthermore, short-term triapine treatment of both SW480
as well as SW480/tria cells resulted in enhanced adhesion
competence to vitronectin but not BSA corresponding to
the changes in integrin α5 expression observed in Western

clearly enhanced in triapine-resistant cells compared
to the parental cell line. While triapine treatment as
single agent reduced Rac and RhoA expression in both
cell lines, combination with cilengitide led to enhanced
Rac and RhoA levels selectively in SW480/tria cells
(Figure 7A). These data suggest cooperation of several
integrin-mediated signaling pathways in acquired triapine
resistance.

resistance, we utilized the human colon carcinoma cell
line SW480 and its triapine-resistant subline SW480/
tria [10]. Previously, we have reported on ABCB1
overexpression in this triapine-resistant SW480 subline
and the corresponding cross-resistance of SW480/tria cells
against several classical chemotherapeutics and substrates
of ABCB1-mediated drug efflux. However, inhibition of
ABCB1 did not result in significant re-sensitization to
triapine suggesting that ABCB1 overexpression is not the
main resistance mechanism in this cell model but rather a
general consequence of stress response [10]. Therefore, we
aimed to identify additional triapine resistance mechanisms
by screening for genome-wide gene dose alterations using
aCGH. Interestingly, only minimal additional gene dose
changes were caused by long-term triapine selection with
the exception of a distinct loss at the chromosomal region

thiosemicarbazone, showed promising results in clinical
trials against hematological diseases [2, 4] but failed in
solid tumors due to unknown reasons so far [5-8]. To

5q12 in SW480/tria cells. This homozygous deletion
selectively affected the PDE4D gene.
In the literature, alterations in phosphodiesterase 4
family members and the resulting changes in cAMP levels
were connected with oncogenic but also tumor-suppressive
functions. With regard to pro-tumorigenic activities,
PDE4 inhibitors were reported to inhibit proliferation,
migration, and progression of several solid tumors as well
as hematological malignancies probably via cAMP-PKA
signaling [35-38]. Accordingly, the cancer-preventive and
therapeutic effects of several natural products including
curcumin and resveratrol were attributed to PDE4D
inhibition [39, 40]. Furthermore, there is strong evidence
for PDE4 to promote angiogenesis via hypoxia-inducible
factor in lung cancer [41]. In contrast to these indications
of pro-tumorigenic functions, repeatedly homozygous
deletions of the PDE4D gene in several malignancies
have been reported [42, 43]. For example, Nancarrow
et al. described that homozygous deletion of PDE4D
resulted in a tumor suppressor phenotype in esophageal
adenocarcinoma [44]. Microdeletions at the PDE4D gene
locus in diverse solid tumors resulted in enhanced gene
expression and sensitivity towards PDE4D knock-down
[43]. Moreover, McEwan et al. reported that combination
of the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram and low doses of the
adenylate cyclase activator forskolin resulted in colon
cancer cell growth inhibition implicating that these cells are
addicted to maintenance of low cAMP concentrations in a
compartment that is regulated by PDE4 [45]. In the present
study, deletion of major parts of the PDE4D-coding region
as a consequence of triapine selection resulted in almost
complete blockade of gene expression at the mRNA and
protein level. Interestingly, this was not accompanied by
altered tumorigenicity and growth dynamics as xenograft
in SCID mice arguing against a major oncogenic or tumorsuppressive role of PDE4D in the SW480 colon cancer
cell model. In contrast, however, we were able to proof
an important contribution of PDE4D loss to the triapine
resistance phenotype of SW480/tria cells.
PDE4D loss in our resistant cell model resulted in
upregulation of cAMP and its major downstream signaling
cascade, namely the PKA-Creb axis [16]. Accordingly,
PDE4D inhibition in the parental cell line via rolipram
and stimulation of cAMP with forskolin resulted in
triapine resistance in the parental cell line but did not
affect SW480/tria cells. Hence, we hypothesized that this
signal module might be the driver for acquired triapine
resistance. In line with that, several indications for a role
of PKA-Creb activation in oncological therapy failure
have been reported. For instance, tamoxifen resistance
in hormone receptor-positive and trastuzumab resistance
in HER2-positive breast cancer might be mediated via
the PKA-Creb axis [46-48]. Moreover, doxorubicin
resistance has been associated with hyperactivation of
Creb in hepatocellular carcinoma [49] and mesothelioma
[50]. In accordance, our triapine-resistant SW480 cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

displayed distinct cross-resistance against doxorubicin
[10]. However, on the one hand, it has to be kept in mind
that SW480/tria cells are overexpressing ABCB1 readily
excreting doxorubicin. On the other hand, it is well
described that PKA-Creb signaling results in increased
ABCB1 expression and inhibition of this pathway might
reverse ABCB1-mediated multi-drug resistance [51, 52].
Furthermore, we have demonstrated previously that the
markedly enhanced expression of protein kinase C (PKC)
in SW480/tria cells contributes to ABCB1 overexpression
[10]. Interestingly, strong evidence exists for a crosstalk
between PKC and PKA-Creb signaling pathways [53]
suggesting that PDE4D loss might play a role in ABCB1
overexpression in SW480/tria cells. Surprisingly, however,
inhibition of PKA with H-89 did not significantly resensitize SW480/tria cells against triapine. Hence, we
had to conclude that the distinctly enhanced PKA-Creb
signaling axis in SW480/tria cells is not a major player in
acquired triapine resistance.
Due to this fact, we extended our investigation to the
more recently discovered second arm of cAMP signaling,
namely the Epac-Rap1 axis, which is also hyper-activated
in SW480/tria cells. Indeed, Epac activation by 007-AM
resulted in triapine resistance of the parental cell line,
whereas Epac knock-down and blockade of Rap1 by the
prenylation inhibitor zoledronic acid [54, 55] re-sensitized
SW480/tria against triapine. In contrast to the PKA-Creb
axis, the Epac-Rap1 signaling module was unequivocally
linked to pro-tumorigenic and resistance-mediating
mechanisms. Thus, enhanced Epac expression plays an
important role in migration and metastasis in melanoma
[56] and pancreatic cancer [29]. Moreover, Onodera et al.
described that the Epac-Rap1 signaling pathway regulates
glucose uptake and metabolism and therefore promotes
oncogenesis [57]. Accordingly, knock-down of Rap1A
increased sensitivity to taxol in non-small cell lung cancer
[58]. It has to be mentioned that Epac represents only
one out of several Rap1 GEFs, including for example
C3K (Crk SH3-domain-binding guanine nucleotidereleasing factor, also known as RAPGEF1), calcium and
diacylglycerol (CalDAG)-GEFs and PDZ-GEF1/2 [59].
Hence, considering the tissue-specific expression of Epac
[60], one might hypothesize that also other mechanisms
for Rap1 activation in triapine resistance might exist.
Interestingly, the adhesion-mediating but also
tumor-promoting functions of cAMP-Rap1 signaling have
been repeatedly linked to its impact on integrin expression
and activity [61, 62]. Therefore, we decided to investigate
whether triapine resistance is based on integrin-mediated
survival signaling. Indeed, we observed an increased basal
expression of several oncogenic RGD-binding integrin
subunits including αv, α5, β1, and β5 in the SW480/tria
cells especially in plasma membrane-enriched protein
fractions. Additionally, we detected a selective stimulation
of integrin α5 expression on the mRNA and protein
level by short-term triapine treatment. Interestingly,
84567

Oncotarget

the respective ITGA5 mRNA was only about two-fold
enhanced in SW480/tria as compared to SW480 cells.
However, short-term triapine treatment enhanced ITGA5
mRNA around ten-fold in both cell models while integrin
αv was widely unresponsive at mRNA (data not shown)
and protein level. This implicates cooperation between
broad integrin activation by upstream mechanisms
involving Epac-Rap1 signaling in acquired triapine
resistance and, additionally, transcriptional upregulation
of integrin α5-containing integrin dimers due to an
immediate triapine response. The underlying mechanisms
are currently dissected in ongoing experiments.
In agreement with enhanced integrin expression, cell
adherence of the resistant subline was moderately more
efficient to cell culture plastic but distinctly enhanced
when using ligands for RGD-binding integrins, namely
vitronectin and fibronectin. Furthermore, this adhesion was
reduced by the integrin inhibitor cilengitide and the Rap1deprenylating agent zoledronic acid at higher potency
in case of the resistant subline. Accordingly, integrin
inhibition by cilengitide resulted in re-sensitization
of SW480/tria cells to triapine, whereas no effect was
observed in the parental cell line. Moreover, combination
of both α5- and αv-specific neutralizing antibodies with
triapine resulted in significant re-sensitization to triapine
in SW480/tria but not the parental SW480 cell model.
Together, this strongly suggests that Epac-Rap1-mediated
survival signals are mediated by integrin-binding to RGDcontaining ligands resulting in acquired triapine resistance.
In line with this observation, several studies reported a
role of altered integrin expression and especially subunit
β1 in resistance against diverse cancer therapeutics in
solid tumors [34]. For example, temozolomide resistance
in glioblastoma [63] and vemurafenib resistance in
melanoma are mediated via α5β1 integrin-dimer [64],
while doxorubicin resistance in leukemia seems to be
promoted by α2β1 [65]. Furthermore, taxol-resistant
ovarian carcinoma patients showed a higher expression of
integrin β1 [66].
When analyzing the most important downstream
signaling pathways of integrins, we found a complex
impact on both the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways
determined by phosphorylation of ERK and S6,
respectively. Additionally, interesting differences between
SW480 and SW480/tria cells were observed regarding
Src phosphorylation. Triapine distinctly upregulated
activating Src phosphorylation at Y416 specifically
in the resistant subline. While, in accordance with the
literature [67], Src phosphorylation was inhibited by
cilengitide as single compound, combination with triapine
synergistically enhanced this effect especially in SW480/
tria cells to levels far above the control. Interestingly, the
triapine-resistant cells exhibited a mild hypersensitivity
to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Combination of triapine
with dasatinib markedly restored triapine sensitivity
of SW480/tria cells. However, at lower concentrations
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also in SW480 cells markedly synergistic effects were
observed. These data suggest that integrin-mediated Src
activation is a player in both intrinsic and acquired triapine
resistance. In accordance, multiple studies have suggested
an important role of integrin-mediated Src hyperactivation
in resistance against antineoplastic drugs but also diverse
anticancer kinase inhibitors [68-71]. However, none of
these studies reported upstream signaling via the EpacRap1 signal cascade. Additionally to Src, we also found
indications that expression of the integrin-downstream
GTPases RhoA and Rac might be differently affected
by triapine and cilengitide in SW480 and SW480/tria
cells. While triapine suppressed expression of these
effector molecules, combination with cilengitide led to
overexpression especially in the triapine resistant cell
model. The hyperactivation of both Src phosphorylation
and RhoA GTPase expression, both known to promote
drug resistance [68-73], in the synergistic combination
between cilengitide and triapine especially in SW480/tria
cells is enigmatic. Currently, we follow the hypothesis that
these effects are already reflecting escape mechanisms of
the cells to survive this effective combination treatment.
Taken together, in the here presented study we
established the cAMP-Epac-Rap1-integrin axis as a
molecular survival mechanism to protect cancer cells
from triapine-mediated cytotoxicity. Whether this
mechanism is triapine-specific or might support other
multi-drug resistance phenotypes needs to be established.
The very broad MDR phenotype of SW480/tria cells
not only against ABCB1 substrates [10] but also diverse
other cytotoxic and antimetabolic drugs points into that
direction. Remarkably enough, also lapatinib-resistant
breast cancer as well as erlotinib-resistant non-small cell
lung cancer cells harbored increased integrin β1 expression
and Src phosphorylation levels [68, 69] suggesting also
a contribution to tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance.
The druggability of several steps in this resistance
signaling axis at the level of cAMP, Rap1, integrin and
Src activation implies combination strategies as a suitable
approach for overcoming triapine insensitivity of solid
tumors in clinical studies.

purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Zoledronic acid
and all other compounds were supplied by Sigma–Aldrich
(MO, USA).
The human colon carcinoma-derived cell lines HCT116 (kindly provided by Dr. Vogelstein, John Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD) and SW480 (ATCC) together
with the triapine-resistant subline SW480/tria established
by our group [10] were used in this study. HCT-116 was
grown in McCoy's and SW480 in minimum essential
medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FCS.

SW480 and SW480/tria cells (3 x 105) were seeded
in 6-well plates and allowed to recover for 24 h. Then,
cells were treated with triapine and rolipram at the
indicated concentrations for another 24 h at 37°C. Cells
were trypsinized, treated with RNAse A (0.2 mg/ml) and
stained with propidium iodide (0.01 mg/ml). Fluorescence
of propidium iodide was measured by flow cytometry
using FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA)
as described previously [77]. CellQuest Pro software
(Becton Dickinson) was used to analyze the resulting
DNA histograms.

Cell viability assay

Colony formation assay

Cell viability was determined by seeding 2 x
104 cells/ml on 96-well plates (100 μl/well). After a
recovery period of 24 h, cells were treated with the test
drugs for another 72 h. Cell viability was measured by
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT)-based vitality assay (EZ4U; Biomedica,
Vienna, Austria) as published [75]. GraphPad Prism
software was used to estimate cell viability expressed
as IC50 values calculated from full dose–response curves
(representing the drug concentrations inducing a 50%
reduction of viable cells in comparison to untreated
control cells cultured in parallel).
The presence of synergy was determined using
the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO, USA)
according to the Chou–Talalay method [76] and expressed
by the combination index (CI). CI < 0.9 represents
synergism, CI = 0.9–1.1 indicates pure additivity and a CI
> 1.1 points to antagonism.

Cells were plated at a density of 3.5 x 103 cells/
well in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with
triapine and rolipram at the indicated concentrations and
incubated for 10 days. Afterwards, cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with methanol for
20 min on 4°C, washed again and stained with 0.01%
crystal violet. Colonies were counted and evaluated with
ImageJ and GraphPad Prism software, respectively.

Array comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH)
For aCGH analyses 4x44K oligonucleotide-based
microarrays (Agilent) were used. Labeling and hybridization
procedures were performed according to protocols provided
by Agilent as previously described [78]. Direct aCGH
was performed to detect differences between SW480 cells
and normal human reference DNA and for comparison of
SW480/tria to SW480 cells, indirect aCGH was performed:
SW480 (instead of normal human reference DNA) was
labeled with Cy3 and SW480/tria cells with Cy5.

Western blot analysis
Cells were treated for 24 h at the indicated
concentrations with the respective drugs. Total protein
lysates were prepared, separated, and transferred onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting
as described previously [75]. Following antibodies were
