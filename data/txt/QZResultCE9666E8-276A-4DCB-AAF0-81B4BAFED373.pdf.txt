ABSTRACT
Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) plays an indispensable role in the tricarboxylic
acid cycle, and IDH mutations are present in nearly 75% of glioma and 20% of acute
myeloid leukemia. One IDH1R132H inhibitor (clomifene citrate) was found by virtual
screening method, which can selectively suppress mutant enzyme activities in vitro
and in vivo with a dose-dependent manner. The molecular docking indicated that
clomifene occupied the allosteric site of the mutant IDH1. Enzymatic kinetics also
demonstrated that clomifene inhibited mutant enzyme in a non-competitive manner.
Moreover, knockdown of mutant IDH1 in HT1080 cells decreased the sensitivity to
clomifene. In vivo studies indicated that clomifene significantly suppressed the tumor
growth of HT1080-bearing CB-17/Icr-scid mice with oral administration of 100 mg/
kg and 50 mg/kg per day. In short, our findings highlight clomifene may have clinical
potential in tumor therapies as a safe and effective inhibitor of mutant IDH1.

(GBM), and 33%-50% in adult primitive neuroectodermal
tumor [3, 4]. Besides brain tumors, IDH1 mutations
have also been detected in other cancers including acute
myeloid leukemia [5], colorectal cancer [6], and prostate
cancer with low frequencies [7].
Biochemically, all of the mutant IDH proteins,
including IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C, concomitant
gain of a neomorphic function that reduce α-KG to D-2hydroxyglutaricacid (D-2HG) using NADPH as the
cofactor [8]. D-2HG has been confirmed to be an inhibitor
of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, therefore, as a result of
mutations in IDH, high cellular concentration of D-2HG
may cause global methylation of histone and DNA, which
may lead to tumorigenesis [9]. In summary, these findings
suggested that novel specific inhibitors of mutant IDH1

INTRODUCTION
Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) are a family of
enzymes that catalyze the conversion of isocitric acid
(ICT) to α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) which is one of the
key reactions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle [1, 2]. This
enzymatic pathway is associated with various molecular
processes regulating the cellular epigenetic states,
including histone and DNA modifications. Accumulated
evidences have revealed mutant IDH enzymes are
observed in multiple human cancers. Reportedly, among
the three isoforms of IDH in humans, frequent somatic
mutations of IDH1 have recently been found in certain
cancers including nearly 80% in grade II-III gliomas,
appropriate 45% in secondary glioblastoma multiforme

may become a new therapy for glioma, AML and other
cancers with IDH1 mutation.
Nowadays, structure-based virtual ligand screening
is playing an increasingly important role in early-stage
drug discovery [10]. In this study, we conducted a
structure based virtual ligand screening to identify small
molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1. Followed by further
examination and verification, we confirmed clomifene, an
effective and low-cost medication for ovulation induction,
as a novel inhibitor of mutant IDH1, which could reduce
the cellular and tumor levels of D-2HG, showing
dramatically on-target activity both in vitro and in vivo.

Further enzyme inhibition assay confirmed
clomifene as the only inhibitor of mutant IDH1 with
reasonable IC50 among 10 compounds (Table 1).

Binding mode of clomifene with IDH1R132H
predicted by molecular docking
In order to further elucidate the binding mode of
clomifene with mutant IDH1, molecular docking was
carried out. The lowest-energy binding conformation
of clomifene was shown as Figure 1b and 1c. From
the generated docking model, clomifene well fitted
the ligand binding site of mutant IDH1 and almost
completely occupied the whole pocket with an extended
conformation. The ligand binding pocket of mutant IDH1
was gourd shaped, where many hydrophobic amino acid,
including Ile112, Ile117, Leu120, Trp124, Ile128, Ile130,
Val255, Trp267, Val281, Tyr285, Leu288, Met290 and
Leu376, form a highly hydrophobic envelop. Clomifene
formed obvious hydrophobic interactions with many of
these amino acids, like two ethyl groups with Val255
and Trp267, benzene ring of phenoxy with Trp124, two
phenyls with Tyr285, 1-phenyl with Met291. Although
there was no hydrogen bonding formed between clomifene
and mutant IDH1 protein, seemingly highly hydrophobic
clomifene molecule could form enough interactions with
the equally hydrophobic binding pocket.

RESULTS
Virtual ligand screening identifies the binding of
clomifene to mutant IDH1
The X-ray structure of the IDH1R132H
heterodimer (PDB: 4UMX) [11, 12] was chosen to
generate a molecular model for our investigations. The
non-commercial database, ZINC Drug Database (ZDD)
containing over 2924 approved drugs and nutraceuticals
were screened against this model in silicon by ICM-Pro
3.8.1 molecular docking software (Molsoft LLC, San
Diego, CA) [13]. Compounds with lower calculated
binding energies were considered to have higher binding
affinities with the target. The docking score results
were presented in Table  1. There were ten compounds
showing significant ICM scores (< -27) which predicted
their possible bindings to mutant IDH1 heterodimer
(Supplementary Figure 1). The proposed binding site and
binding pose of compounds were inspected and results
were listed in the Table 1. Clomifene, cefoxitin sodium,
tigecycline and adapalene were predicted to coordinate
the binding pocket of the ligand in the crystal structure
with high occupancy.

Clomifene selectively inhibits mutant IDH1
activity in vitro
In order to identify the selective inhibitory activity
of screening hits against IDH1R132H, IDH1R132C
and wild type (WT) IDH1, recombinant proteins of all
constructs were overexpressed and purified. Enzyme
activity assay demonstrated that clomifene inhibited
IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C with IC50 values of 50.20
± 0.12 μM and 42.33 ± 0.31 μM but did not obviously
alter the viability of WT IDH1 even at 200 μM (Table 1,
Figure 1f), which indicated the reasonable selectivity and
significant inhibitory of clomifene.
The inhibition of IDH1R132H by clomifene was
showing a non-competitive manner for the substrate
α-KG and NADPH (Figure 1g and 1h). Initial kinetic
studies indicated that the Vmax of mutant IDH1
was 0.065 OD/min and the Km for α-KG was 2.792
mM, after treatment with 50 μM clomifene, the Km
and Vmax calculated from Michaelis-Menten curve
changed to 2.571 mM and 0.025 OD/min respectively
(Supplementary Table  1). Molecular docking
predicted that clomifene bind with mutant IDH1 in
the ligand binding pocket, in which the ligand, 2,6-bis
(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2yl) phenol, a non-competitive and allosteric inhibitor
bind with the enzyme in the allosteric site [10]. The
result of enzymatic inhibition assay which was showing

Specific binding of clomifene with mutant IDH1
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) method was
further employed to validate the finding of virtual
screening. MST technology is based on fluorescence
detection and thermophoresis to precisely measure
protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions
with low sample consumptions [14]. Of all the
compounds assaied, clomifene exhibited the lowest
equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 18.45 ±
1.61 μM (Table 1, Figure 1a and 1d), which means the
strongest binding with the target protein. The binding
affinity of clomifene was comparable to that of AGI5198, a previously reported IDH1R132H inhibitor (Table
1, Figure 1a and 1e). Results of MST measurements
proved this hypothesis that clomifene was the one
showing highest binding affinity to the mutant IDH1
(Supplementary Figure 2).

induced 12.88%, and 23.61% apoptotic death compared
with 2% of the control (Figure 2b).
To further understand the mechanism of clomifeneinduced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, we next
investigated whether the histone methylation in cells
could be affected. As mentioned above, D-2HG is an
inhibitor of histone demethylases, which are α-KGdependent dioxygenases [16]. Consequently, D-2HG may
cause global methylation of histones. After treated with
clomifene for 48 hours, histone proteins were extracted
and methylation level of H3K9me3 was measured by
western blot analysis [17]. As shown in Figure 2c,
clomifene could markedly decrease the level of histone
methylation in HT1080 cells with a dose-dependent
manner. These results suggested that clomifene could
restore the activities of histone demethylases and avoid
the wide hypermethylation of histones, as the result of
reducing the concentration of D-2HG.

Clomifene inhibits mutant IDH1 activity and
represses cancer cell growth in vitro
Encouraging by promising inhibitory activities
of clomifene on mutant IDH1 enzymes activity, in
consideration of both IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C
concomitant gain of the same neomorphic function that
reduce α-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutaricacid (D-2HG) using
NADPH as the cofactor, human fibrosarcoma cell line
HT1080 harboring R132C mutation of IDH1, the most
common IDH mutation in glioma, was selected to further
examined for its biological activity in vitro [15]. After
treatment with various concentrations of clomifene or
0.5% DMSO as a vehicle control for 48 h, the inhibition of
mutant IDH1 was tested by measuring the concentration
of D-2HG in cellular supernatant via a LC-MS method.
As shown in Figure 2a, a dose-dependent decrease in
D-2HG levels with an IC50 value of 37.86 ± 0.32 μM was
observed.
Effects of clomifene on the cellular apoptosis
of HT1080 cells were further investigated using flow
cytometry analysis. Normalization to the DMSO-treated
controls revealed that clomifene at 10 μM and 20 μM

with a shMOCK or shIDH1R132C plasmid (Figure 3a).
Clomifene suppressed growth of shMOCK cells but
had fewer effects on shIDH1R132C cells (Figure 3b).
Immunocytochemical staining results showed that mutant
IDH1-mediated H3K9me3 was substantially and dosedependently decreased with clomifene treatment (Figure
3c). These results suggested that mutant IDH1 was a direct
target for clomifene to suppress cancer cell growth.

high-dose treated groups were 1.43 ± 0.42 g and 0.94 ±
0.61 g respectively (Figure 4d, Supplementary Table 3),
representing significant inhibition ratio. Moreover, no
obvious hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, or different of
average body weights between three groups were observed
throughout the study (Figure 4b, Supplementary Figure
3), which revealed that the dosage of clomifene used in
this experiment had no obvious side effects on animals’
growth. Furthermore, clomifene at 100 mg/kg decreased
the tumor weight by about 60% (Supplementary Table 3),
comparable to the results of AGI-5198 at a dose of 450
mg/kg [4].
We then examined D-2HG concentrations in tumors
and serum. As shown in Figure 5b, D-2HG concentration
of tumour tissue from vehicle control group was 364.01 ±
118.43 μg/g (Supplementary Table 4). By normalization to
the control group, clomifene at 50 and 100 mg/kg could
induce 23.81% and 57.38% inhibitory of D-2HG production
respectively, meanwhile, a similar inhibition was detected
in serum (Figure 5c, Supplementary Table 4). In order to
further reveal the relationship between antitumor effects and
inhibitions of mutant IDH1 enzymes by clomifene, tumor
tissues extracted from different groups were subjected to
an immunohistochemistry analysis for H3K9me3. Results
exhibited that expressions of H3K9me3 were substantially
reduced in clomifene treated groups compared with the
vehicle group (Figure 5a). Taken together, these results
suggested that clomifene effectively and safely suppresses
the tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting mutant IDH1.

Clomifene suppresses tumor growth by
inhibiting mutant IDH1 activity in vivo
All above tests and data showed clomifene was
an effective inhibitor of IDH1R132H in vitro. We next
evaluated the in vivo antitumor efficacy of clomifene.
In the xenograft model, HT1080 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously into the right flank of male CB-17/Icrscid mice [18]. The tumor-bearing mice were then divided
into three matched groups including the vehicle control
and two clomifene treating groups (50, 100 mg/kg). After
establishing palpable tumors, mice were administrated
with clomifene or vehicle via gavage once every day.
Estimated tumor volumes of both treating
groups were much less than that of the control group
throughout the therapeutic process. (Figure 4a, Figure
4c, Supplementary Table 2). After 2 weeks’ treatment,
all mice were then scarified and the average tumor
weights were calculated. The tumor weight of the control
group was 2.32 ± 0.93 g, whereas that of low-dose and

DISCUSSION

carcinogenesis. Following biochemical verification, we
confirmed that treatment with clomifene could strongly
reduce productions of D-2HG in vitro and in vivo. Notably,
clomifene markedly repressed the tumor growth in the
mouse xenograft model accompanied by significantly
reduced levels of H3K9me3 mark in tumor tissues.
In summary, we have identified a new inhibitor
of mutant IDH1 from ZDD database by virtual ligand
screening and demonstrated its pharmacological inhibition
on mutant enzyme both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our
findings provide a possible drug candidate targeted mutant
IDH1 and a new lead compound for IDH1 inhibitor
discovery. As far as we know, clomifene is the first
FDA approved drug reported to exhibit potent inhibitory
activities against mutant IDH1 both in vitro and in vivo.
This may accelerate the application of IDH1 inhibitors
in clinical by applying new indications of this drug, to
benefit a large number of patients with glioma or AML.
In our future study, more detailed action mechanisms
of clomifene will be studied, and more derivatives of
clomifene will be synthesized followed by structure
guided lead optimization.

New drug development is a time-consuming and
costly process, and the discovery of a new chemical entity
need to pay a lot of cost, many candidate compounds failed
in the late phase of clinical trials. Drug repurposing is able
to partly overcome the difficulties of this process, because
a known drug has been widely used in clinical practice;
its druggability and safety have been verified. What you
need is to change the indication by demonstrating its
pharmacological effects on the new indication. Therefore,
this method is becoming an effective way to discover new
drugs rapidly and has been widely applied in recent years.
Structure based virtual screening represents a new
direction for drug discovery and has been gradually
developed recently, by the method, one can quickly screen
large numbers of compounds in a short period of time,
to find possible candidate compounds, with low cost and
high success rate. Applying the virtual screening method
to drug repurposing by screening drug database based on
the target structure is an effective way to discover new
indications of old drugs, and there are many successful
examples in recent years [19].
Clomifene was used as a selective estrogen receptor
modulator for treatment of female infertility due to
anovulation [20–22]. It was also proposed as a drug to
reverse impotence in men due to low testosterone levels
[23, 24] and is currently used off-label for men with
hypogonadism. In this study, we identify clomifene as a
potent mutant IDH1 inhibitor by structure based virtual
ligand screening. In the crystal structure of inhibitormutant IDH1 complex (PDB code: 4UMX), which was
chosen as the model for molecular docking, the noncompetitive and allosteric ligand 2,6-bis (1H-imidazol1-ylmethyl)-4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl) phenol bound
with the enzyme in the allosteric site. From the generated
docking model, clomifene was well fitted into the same
allosteric site with an extended conformation. The
inhibition of IDH1R132H by clomifene also showed
a non-competitive manner for the substrate α-KG and
NADPH, which was consistent with the results of
molecular docking. Further molecular docking predicted
that the binding site of AGI-5198 with mutant IDH1
was close to the pocket of active center near NADP
(Supplementary Figure 4). Detailed studies of kinetic
mechanism of action demonstrated that AGI-5198 played
roles as competitive inhibitor with respect to α-KG
and uncompetitive with respect to NADPH [8]. Thus,
clomifene inhibits the mutant IDH1 with a different
mechanism other than AGI-5198.
Previous studies have demonstrated that IDH1
mutations could catalyze another new reaction in which
α-KG is reduced to D-2-hydroxyglutaricacid (D-2HG)
using NADPH as the cofactor, which may cause global
DNA and histone hypermethylation, and finally lead to

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and antibodies
The HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line harboring IDH1
(R132C) mutation (ATCC # CCL-121™) and WI-38
(ATCC # CCL-75™) were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA). Clomifene citrate
was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Huston, USA).
The structure was confirmed by NMR and purity (99%)
was measured by HPLC analysis. The antibody against
H3K9me3 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA), β-actin and secondary antibody from
rabbit were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). All other common chemicals, solvents
and reagents were of highest grade available from various
commercial sources.

Molecular docking and virtual screening
First, the subset ZDD (ZINC Drug Database),
a special subset of ZINC containing all commercially
available approved drugs and nutraceuticals world wide,
was downloaded from ZINC as mol2 files. Then molecular
docking and virtual screening was performed on the
compounds of the subset ZDD downloaded before. The
docking was performed by using ICM 3.8.1 modeling
software on an Intel i7 4960 processor (MolSoft LLC,
San Diego, CA). Ligand binding pocket residues were
selected by using graphical tools in the ICM software,
to create the boundaries of the docking search. In the
docking calculation, potential energy maps of the receptor

were calculated using default parameters. Compounds
were imported into ICM and an index file was created.
Conformational sampling was based on the Monte Carlo
procedure, and finally the lowest-energy and the most
favorable orientation of the ligand were selected [25].

The activity and inhibition of IDH1R132H
and IDH1R132C were determined by measuring the
initial linear consumption of NADPH of the reaction.
The enzyme activity assay was performed in a 96well microplate using the purified IDH1 mutant (2
μM), 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM α-KG, 100 μM NADPH
(>>Km for NADPH) in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH =
7.5) containing 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. For
inhibition assay, firstly, triplicate samples of compounds
were incubated with the protein for 5 min. Next, the
reaction was initiated by adding α-KG into the 96-well
microplate. The consumption of NADPH was measured
by monitoring the optical absorbance of each well
every 30s at 340 nm, which is the maximum absorption
wavelength of NADPH, using a BioTek Synergy HT
microplate reader. The activity and inhibition of WTIDH1 were determined by measuring the production
of NADPH. In brief, the enzyme activity assay was
performed in a 96-well microplate using the purified
IDH1 (43 nM), 4 mM MgCl2, 50 μM sodium (D)isocitrate, 1mM NADP+ (>>Km for NADP) in 50 mM
HEPES buffer (pH = 7.5). The reaction can be readily
monitored by an increase in optical absorbance at 340
nm. The data were imported into Prism (version 6.02,
GraphPad) and the IC50 values were calculated by using
a standard dose response curve fitting.

Expression and purification of R132H and
R132C mutant IDH1
R132H and R132C mutant IDH1 genes were
generated from the wild-type IDH1 plasmid, using Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Correctness of the gene
sequences was verified. The IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C
were cloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen). The
expression construct pET28a-IDH1R132H and pET28aIDH1R132HC were transformed into Escherichia
coli strain BL21 (DE) (Invitrogen) and selected on
kanamycin plates. The transformed cells were cultivated
in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37 °C in the presence of
kanamycin until the optical density (OD) reached 0.8.
Cells were then induced with 0.4 mM IPTG (isopropylβ-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) for 16 h at 20 °C. The cells
harvested by centrifugation were lysed by ultrasonication
on ice in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mM
NaCl, 5 mM mercaptoethanol, 0.1% TritonX-100, and 5%
glycerol.
Soluble C-terminally hexa-histidine tagged
IDH1R132H and IDHR132C were bound to Ni-agarose
affinity resin (Qiagen), washed with buffer A (20 mM
Tris, pH 8.5, 200mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole), and
eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 250 mM NaCl,
and 150 mM imidazole). The protein was further purified
with anion exchange chromatography and size exclusion
chromatography.

Cell culture
HT1080 and WI-38 cells were both cultured in high
Glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin. Cell cultures were grown and maintained in
culture at 37 °C in a humidified tissue culture incubator
with 5% CO2. The cell cultures were performed following
the instructions of ATCC.

Microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay
Recombinant IDHR132H was labeled with the
Monolith NT™ Protein Labeling Kit RED (Cat # L001)
according to the supplied labeling protocol. The
concentration of labeled IDHR132H in the test was 50 nM.
Samples were diluted in a 20mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.5
(v/v) % Tween-20. The clomifene stock was dissolved in
10% DMSO at a concentration of 5 mM. We used 500
μM clomifene as the highest concentration for the serial
dilution. After 10 min incubation at room temperature the
samples were loaded into MonolithTM standard-treated
capillaries and the thermophoresis was measured at 25 °C
after 30 min incubation on a Monolith NT.115 instrument
(NanoTemper Technologies, München, Germany). Laser
power was set to 40% using 30 seconds on-time. The
LED power was set to 100%. The dissociation constrant
Kd values were fitted by using the NTAnalysis software
(NanoTemper Technologies, München, Germany)

Cytotoxicity test
To estimate cell viability, HT1080 and WI-38 cells
(5000/well) were separately seeded in 96-well plates
for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The attached
cells were fed with fresh medium containing various
concentrations of clomifene (0-100 μM) for additional
48 h. After culturing for various times, the cytotoxicity
of clomifene was measured using a CCK8 assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All the
experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean
absorbance values were calculated. The results are
expressed as the percentage of inhibition that produced a
reduction in absorbance by clomifene treatment compared
with the non-treated cells.

D-2HG Production

Western blot analysis

The D-2HG production inhibition assay was
described as follows. In brief, 5000cells/well were seeded
into wells of a 96-well plate for 24 h. Cells were then
treated with an increasing concentration of compounds
in 100 μL of culture medium for 48 h. Medium was
collected and diluted with 400 μL of methanol. After
shaking, the mixture was centrifuged to remove any
precipitate, and the supernatant was prepared to make
measurement of D-2HG by HPLC-MS. The LC-MS/
MS system consisted of a Shimadzu Prominence UFLC
system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and an
API4000 QTrap® triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with an
electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Chromatographic
separation was carried out on a Welch Ultimate® XBC18 column at 40 °C (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 3.0 μm;
Welch Materials, Shanghai, China) protected by a C18
guard column (4.0 mm × 2.0 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of 10
mM ammonium acetate in water (pH = 7.4 adjusted with
ammonium hydroxide, phase A) and methanol (phase
B). The following gradient conditions were used: 0-1.50
min, 30-90% B; 1.50-2.00 min, 90% B; 2.00-2.01 min,
90-30% B; 2.01-3.00 min, 30% B. Mass spectrometric
detection was performed in negative ion electrospray
mode with multiple reactions monitoring (MRM),
monitoring the precursor to product ion transition of m/z
146.8→128.6 for D-2HG. The source parameters were
optimized as follows: curtain gas: 20 psi, collision gas
(CAD): high, ionSpray voltage: -4500 V, temperature:
500 °C, nebulizer gas: 40 psi, auxiliary gas: 50 psi and
interface heater: on. The optimum compound dependent
parameters including decluttering potential (DP),
collision energy (CE), entrance potential (EP) and cell
exit potential (CXP) were set at -55, -14, -10, -9V for
D-2HG. Data acquisition and processing were controlled
by Analyst 1.6.1 software (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA,
USA). Prior to measurements of D-2HG concentrations,
the LC-MS/MS assay was validated and calibrated by
authentic D-2HG purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St
Louis, MO, USA). IC50 was calculated from the doseresponse curve by Prism 6.02 [8].

The harvested cells were lysed with lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mg/mL aprotinin, 10 mg/mL
leupeptin, 5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyluoride (PMSF),
1 mM dithiolthreitol (DTT) containing 1% Triton
X-100). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation
at 13000 rpm for 20 minutes, and the content of protein
was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad,
USA). Lysate protein (20-40 μg) was subjected to
12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore,
USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
milk for 1 h and then incubated with the respective specific
primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Protein bands were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent
(ECL Plus) (GE Healthcare, USA) after hybridization with
a HRP conjugated secondary antibody. Band density was
quantified using the Image J software program (NIH).

Generation of sublines with inducible
IDH1 knockdown
HT1080 cells were infected with lentiviral
particles containing either pTRIPz empty vector
(OpenBiosystems), pTRIPz IDH1 sh484 (targeting the
CDS). The target sequences of oligo siRNAs were as
follows: 5'-GGACTTGGCTGCTTGCATT-3' for IDH1 to
produce lentiviral particles, 293T cells were co-transfected
with pTRIPz vectors, psPAX2 (Addgene # 12260), and
pMD2.G (Addgene # 12259) and supernatant containing
viral particles was collected at 36 and 72 hours [16].

Immunocytochemical staining
We seeded the cells at 2×105 per well (Lab-Tek II
chamber slide, Nalgen Nunc International, Naperville,
IL). 48 hours after incubation, cells were fixed with PBS
(-) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, and
rendered permeable with PBS (-) containing 0.1% Triton
X-100 at 4 °C for 2.5 minutes. Subsequently, the cells
were covered with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (-)
at 4 °C for 12 hours to block nonspecific hybridization
followed by incubation with an H3K9me3 antibody
diluted at 1:100. After washing with PBS (-), the cells
were stained by an Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)
diluted at 1: 1,000. Nuclei were counterstained with
(DAPI). Fluorescent images were obtained under a TCS
SP2 AOBS microscope (Leica, Tokyo, Japan).

Flow cytometric analysis for apoptosis
HT1080 cells were cultured in six-well plates and
treated with different concentrations of clomifene for
48 h. Then the cells were harvested, washed twice with
ice-cold PBS, and mixed in 100 μL of 1 × binding buffer
(10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
CaCl2). After culturing for 15 min at room temperature
in Annexin-V/PI (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech. Inc.) double
staining liquid, the cells were examined by flow cytometry
(BD Biosciences, FACSCalibur).

China). The animals were maintained under ‘specific
pathogen-free’ conditions according to the guidelines
established by Research Animal Resources, Laboratory
Animal Center, Huazhong University of Science and
Technology (Wuhan, China). The mice were randomly
divided into three groups: vehicle group, 50 or 100 mg/
kg clomifene-treated group (n = 6), the experiment was
repeated with HT1080 cancer cells. HT1080 cells were
inoculated subcutaneously (2 × 106 cells) into the right
flank of each mouse in the three groups. Treatment
was started after seven days of cells injection. For the
clomifene group, 1 or 2 mg clomifene, formulated in
200 μL normal saline, was administered to each mouse
every day via gavage. For the vehicle group, 200 μL
normal saline was administered to each mouse every day
by i.g. The duration of the animal study was 22 days for
HT1080 cells. The tumor volume was calculated from
measurements of 3 diameters of the individual tumor
based on the following formula: tumor volume (mm3) =
(length × width × height × 0.52). The mice were monitored
until tumors reached 1 cm3 total volume, at which time the
mice were euthanized and the tumors were extracted. The
tumors were dissected and sent for immunohistochemical
analysis and western blot analysis. All animal experiments
were performed following the protocols approved by the
Laboratory Animal Center of the Huazhong University
of Science and Technology. All animal experiments were
performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals of Huazhong University
of Science and Technology and approved by the Ethics
Committee.
