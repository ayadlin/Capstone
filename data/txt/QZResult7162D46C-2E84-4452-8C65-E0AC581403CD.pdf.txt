BACKGROUND. Evidence from randomized trials in the pre-sentinel lymph node
biopsy era indicate that adjuvant treatment with high-dose interferon-a (IFN)
increases recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with high-risk melanoma.
However, to the authors’ knowledge, the role of this treatment in selected
patients with early stage III disease has not been well studied.

METHODS. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of 486 patients undergoing
surgical treatment for stage III melanoma were evaluated and the authors compared outcomes for those given adjuvant treatment with IFN with those patients
who had surgery alone. A particular focus was on the effect of IFN therapy on
RFS and overall survival (OS) among those patients with stage IIIA disease.

RESULTS. The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 5.2 years; the 5-year

be the only independent predictor for RFS in patients with stage IIIA disease
found to be associated with increased RFS in patients with more advanced lymph
node disease (stage IIIB and stage IIIC). IFN appeared to have no effect on OS in
any patient with stage III disease.

CONCLUSIONS. Adjuvant treatment with IFN improves RFS in melanoma patients
with early stage III disease. The results of the current study should help guide
management when considering adjuvant treatment for these patients. Cancer

A

t least 10% of the estimated 59,940 new cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma diagnosed in 2007 will have presented as regional/lymph node (stage III) disease.1–3 The outcome for patients
with stage III melanoma varies significantly, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates ranging from 26% to 67% depending on the extent
of metastatic disease (the number of positive lymph nodes and
whether the metastasis is microscopic vs macroscopic)2,3 and primary tumor characteristics (such as the presence of ulceration). In
general, surgical treatment has proven inadequate for patients with
stage III melanoma, and several adjuvant regimens have been investigated. Although no apparent benefit with regard to OS has been
demonstrated, high-dose interferon-a (IFN) has been shown to
increase recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with high-risk disease,4–11 and to the best of our knowledge, this is the only adjuvant
treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for malignant melanoma. Nevertheless, IFN is not always

recommended because of its significant toxicity profile,10 its effects on quality of life,12,13 and its cost.14
Recommendations for the use of IFN are derived
primarily from the findings of 2 randomized trials
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 1684
and Intergroup E1690)4,5 in which this regimen was
compared directly with observation only for patients
with thick primary tumors (ie, Breslow thickness
of >4 mm) in the absence of lymph node disease
(stage IIB) and for patients with primary or recurrent
metastatic lymph node disease (stage III).15 The participants in these studies were accrued between 1984
and 1995, primarily before sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) had been introduced; therefore, microscopic lymph node disease was identified in few
patients after elective lymph node dissection, which
was performed either as a study prerequisite (ECOG
1684) or after selective lymphadenectomy for
patients with high-risk disease (Intergroup E1690).
Since that time, SLNB has become the recommended method for the pathologic staging of all primary melanomas measuring >1-mm thick and in
selected patients with thin (<1 mm) melanomas.16–18
As a result of the adoption of SLNB19 and the use of
enhanced tissue processing (eg, immunohistochemical staining),16,20–22 patients with early stage III disease, specifically those with micrometastatic lymph
node involvement, are being identified more frequently. This shift is now reflected in the most recent
(2002) version of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) staging system (sixth edition),2,3,23 in
which lymph node stage is defined not only by the
number of positive lymph nodes but also by the
extent of lymph node involvement (microscopic vs
macroscopic), as derived from tissue evaluation that
includes serial sectioning and immunohistochemical
analysis of SLNs. Although both of the randomized
trials noted above4,5 included patients with microscopic lymph node disease identified by elective
lymph node dissection, few such patients were studied (34 in the ECOG 1684 study and 68 in the Intergroup E1690 study) and the surgical specimens were
not subjected to serial sectioning or immunohistochemical staining, which raises the question of
whether the outcomes associated with adjuvant IFN
can reasonably be extrapolated to patients with
micrometastatic lymph node disease as defined by
more contemporary methods.
Given the lack of information regarding the role
of adjuvant high-dose IFN therapy for patients with
early stage III disease, we conducted a retrospective
review to identify the impact of IFN therapy on survival outcomes for patients with metastatic lymph
node cutaneous melanoma, with the primary objec-

2031

tive of examining the subgroup of patients with stage
IIIA disease (micrometastatic disease with nonulcerated primary tumor).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Initially, we identified a total of
804 consecutive patients with melanoma metastatic
to 1 regional lymph node basins (ie, stage III disease) who had been treated at MDACC between 1990
and 2001. From this group, we selected only those
patients treated after 1995 (the time at which highdose IFN was approved by the FDA as adjuvant therapy for melanoma), yielding the 486 patients who
constituted the cohort for this study. Medical records
from all patients were reviewed and demographic,
clinical, pathologic, treatment, and outcome variables
were extracted and recorded. Disease was restaged at
the time of review according to the sixth edition of
the AJCC staging system.2,3 All 486 patients had
undergone therapeutic lymph node dissection (LND)
of the regional lymph node basin or basins at
MDACC. Two groups were subsequently identified:
those given IFN as adjuvant therapy (IFN group) and
those who underwent surgery without adjuvant treatment (observation group) based on recommendations
from the treating physician and individual patient
preference according to standard protocols described
elsewhere.4–6 Patients were followed every 3 months
for the first 2 years after LND, at 6-month intervals
until Year 5, and yearly thereafter.
Outcomes
RFS time, defined as the period from therapeutic
LND to disease recurrence (local/regional or distant)
or death, was the primary outcome of interest; OS
time, calculated from the date of therapeutic LND to
the date of death, was considered as a secondary
endpoint. Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was
also calculated as the time from therapeutic LND to
the time of distant disease recurrence or death.
Patients without disease recurrence or death were
censored by using the date of last follow-up for each
outcome. The median RFS and OS, as well as the 5year RFS and OS, were calculated for both the IFN
and the observation groups. The association between
IFN and RFS was evaluated further for subgroups
with pathologic stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC disease.
Pathologic stage IIIA disease includes patients with
up to 3 microscopic lymph node metastases arising
from a nonulcerated primary melanoma. Stage IIIB

disease consists of patients with up to 3 macroscopic
lymph node metastases arising from a nonulcerated
primary melanoma, or up to 3 microscopic lymph
node metastases arising from an ulcerated primary
melanoma, or intralymphatic metastases without
lymph node metastases. Stage IIIC disease consists
of patients with clinically apparent lymph node metastasis (macroscopic) arising from an ulcerated primary melanoma, or those with 4 lymph node
metastases, matted lymph node metastasis, or combined lymph node and in-transit metastasis in the
absence of distant disease.24

Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics
were compared for patients in the IFN and observation groups using the chi-square test or Fisher exact
test, as appropriate. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate RFS and OS in all patients with stage
III disease as well as for subsets of patients with stage
IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease. The Cox proportional
hazards model was used to assess the prognostic significance of demographic, clinicopathologic, and
treatment variables. A P value of .05 was considered
to be statistically significant. All computations were
performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.1;
SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The median follow-up time for the 486 patients with
stage III melanoma was 5.2 years. Of these patients,
141 (29%) received adjuvant therapy with IFN. The
distribution of demographic and clinicopathologic
variables for both the IFN and observation groups
are listed in Table 1. Patients in the IFN group were
more likely to be younger than those in the observation group (54% vs 43% patients age <50 years;
P 5 .02) and less likely to have extracapsular lymph
node extension in the LND specimens (12% vs 21%;
P 5 .02). Disease stage was classified according to
the sixth edition of the AJCC system in 462 patients;
110 patients (24%) had stage IIIA disease, 192
patients (42%) had stage IIIB disease, and 160
patients (35%) had stage IIIC disease. Disease stage
in the remaining 24 patients could not be determined, primarily because of unknown primary tumor
characteristics.

Distant Disease-free Survival
The median DDFS time for the entire cohort
(n 5 486 patients) was 4.07 years (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 2.75–5.2 years), and the KaplanMeier estimated 5-year DDFS for the entire group

Recurrence-free Survival
The median RFS time for the entire cohort (n 5 486
patients) was 2.27 years (95% CI, 1.84–3.76 years),
and the Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year RFS for the
entire group was 41% (95% CI, 36–46%). The median
RFS time for the IFN group was 3.82 years (95% CI,
2.21 years to not reached) and that for the observation group was 2.06 years (95% CI, 1.54–2.96 years).
The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year RFS was 44%
(95% CI, 36–54%) for the IFN group and 39% (95%
CI, 34–45%) for the observation group (P 5 .08). Independent prognostic factors for RFS on multivariate
analyses were age 50 years (hazards ratio [HR] of
1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8 [P 5 .01]), N2 disease (HR of 1.5;
95% CI, 1.1–2.1 [P 5 .01]), N3 disease (HR of 3; 95%
CI, 2.2–4.1 [P <.001]), and acral lentigenous tumor
histology (HR of 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–2.9 [P 5 .01]).
Receiving adjuvant IFN was not found to be an independent prognostic factor for RFS for the combined
group of patients with stage III disease (HR of 0.8;
95% CI, 0.6–1.1 [P 5 .09]).
Overall Survival
The median OS time for the entire stage III cohort
was 5.6 years (95% CI, 4.9 years to not reached), and
the Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year OS was 53% (95%
CI, 49–58%). The median 5-year OS for the IFN
group was 60% (95% CI, 52–69%) and was 50% (95%
CI, 45–56%) in the observation group (P 5 .04). However, when controlling for additional prognostic factors, adjuvant IFN therapy was not found to be an
independent prognostic factor of OS for the entire
stage III cohort (data not shown).
Effect of Adjuvant IFN According to Disease Substage
Of the 110 patients with stage IIIA disease, 42 (38%)
had been given IFN as adjuvant therapy. Of these 42
patients, 12 (29%) developed disease recurrence
compared with 27 patients (39%) in the observation
group (P 5 .09 on univariate analysis). The numbers
of recurrences between the IFN and the observation
groups were more evenly distributed among patients
with more advanced disease stage (60% in the IFN
group vs 61% in the observation group for stage IIIB
disease and 79% in the IFN group vs 74% in the observation group for stage IIIC disease). Unadjusted
Kaplan-Meier estimates for DDFS, RFS, and OS were
initially examined to evaluate the effect of IFN therapy according to disease substage (Table 2). The 5year RFS was found to be slightly lower, although not
statistically significant, in the observation group
(61%) compared with the IFN group (70%) for those
with stage IIIA disease (P 5 .09) (Fig. 1), whereas the
5-year RFS times were found to be similar among

IIIC disease (30% in the observation group vs 20% in
the IFN group (Fig. 3).
When clinicopathologic covariates were accounted for on multivariate analyses, adjuvant IFN
therapy was identified as the only independent predictor of RFS for patients with stage IIIA disease, with
an HR of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2–0.9; P 5 .02). Adjuvant IFN
therapy was not found to be an independent predictor
for RFS for patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease (Table 3). Similarly, after controlling for prognostic factors, IFN was not found to be an independent
predictor of OS in any of the 3 disease substages
(stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC) (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In our covariate-adjusted analysis of 110 melanoma
patients with stage IIIA disease, patients who had
been treated with adjuvant IFN demonstrated a significant improvement in RFS compared with patients
who had not received adjuvant IFN. At 5 years’ of
follow-up, the use of IFN was associated with lower
rates of disease recurrence, with a cumulative absolute benefit of 9%. However, these results did not
translate into significant differences in OS. Moreover,
this benefit was not evident for patients with more
advanced lymph node disease (stages IIIB and IIIC).
Patients with stage IIIB disease experienced a similar
5-year RFS regardless of whether they had received
IFN. Similarly, no benefit was found for patients treated with IFN who had bulky lymph node disease
(stage IIIC), which likely can be explained by the presence of a higher burden of distant micrometastatic

node staging (SLNB) including immunohistochemical
analysis. The most recent revision of the AJCC staging system for melanoma (2002) identified both
ulceration and micrometastatic versus macrometastatic lymph node disease as important prognostic
factors,2,3,23 factors that were not part of the staging
classification at the time of the previous IFN trials
(the ECOG 1684 and Intergroup E1690 studies).4,5 In
the current analysis, patients with micrometastatic
lymph node disease and no primary tumor ulceration (stage IIIA) were identified and examined as a
separate cohort, thereby allowing us to evaluate the
effect of IFN therapy in a specific subgroup that to
our knowledge had not been studied previously.
Several points merit comment when comparing
our findings with those of published randomized
trials of high-dose IFN therapy,4–7 a few systematic
reviews, and a meta-analysis on the topic.9–11 First,
the randomized trials included heterogeneous populations of patients with high-risk disease with respect
to prognosis. Second, the previously published trials
included only relatively small numbers of patients

with microscopic-only disease, and the relative accuracy with which this condition was diagnosed was
lower compared with the current report. For example, in the ECOG 1684 trial, microscopic-only disease
was identified after mandatory LND,4 which is recognized to be less accurate for pathologic staging than
current SLNB techniques.16,20,21 In the Intergroup
E1690 trial, LND was not required for patients without clinically apparent lymph node metastasis and
was performed electively in only a minority of these
patients (24%; selection criteria not specified), allowing for an even greater gap in the accuracy of the diagnosis of microscopic-only disease based on current
standards.5 The Intergroup E1694 trial, which compared high-dose IFN therapy versus the ganglioside
GM2-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (GMK) vaccine in
patients with high-risk melanoma, used the same
guidelines for selective lymphadenectomy as those
used in the Intergroup E1690 trial.5,6 To our knowledge, these 3 trials together constitute the largest
numbers of patients with high-risk disease (280
patients, 608 patients, and 774 patients, respectively)

randomized to high-dose IFN versus observation (the
ECOG 1684 and Intergroup E1690 studies) or to
high-dose IFN versus other treatment (the Intergroup
E1694 study). However, the numbers of patients
identified with microscopic lymph node disease in
each trial and in a pooled analysis of the ECOG 1684
and Intergroup E1690 studies7 were significantly less
than the numbers in our report (Table 4). Furthermore, the presence of micrometastatic disease in relation to ulcerated and nonulcerated primary tumors is
not well delineated, limiting the interpretation of their
results in different prognostic groups stratified using
current standards (specifically, stage IIIA disease).
The effects of adjuvant high-dose IFN therapy in
patients with microscopic-only lymph node disease,
and stage IIIA disease specifically, are inconsistent in
the published literature. For example, in the ECOG
1684 study, the benefit with regard to RFS was noted
in all patients with lymph node-positive disease,
although the effect was more pronounced in those
with clinically positive lymph nodes.4 In the Intergroup E1690 study, patients with 2 or 3 positive lymph
nodes were noted to derive the most benefit with
respect to RFS after treatment with high-dose IFN.5 In
contrast, in the Intergroup E1694 study, patients with
high-risk, lymph node-negative disease (stage IIB)
benefited the most from adjuvant IFN therapy.6 This
group of high-risk patients, which likely included a
significant proportion of patients with unidentified
micrometastatic disease, may well represent the group
that is most similar to our contemporary cohort.
These differences in survival outcomes previously
have been explained by the heterogeneity of each
study population and by the differences in patient
characteristics between trials. Furthermore, the different distribution and small numbers of patients with
microscopic-only disease in these trials may also contribute to these seemingly contradictory results.
Although the patient population in the current
analysis was homogeneous and the analyses were
adjusted for known prognostic factors, the interpretation of these findings must take into consideration
that the study size was relatively small and that
patients were not randomized between the IFN and
the observation groups. Although the Cox model can
adjust for known clinicopathologic and treatment
factors, we cannot exclude the possibility that the
effects of IFN arose as a consequence of an imbalance in unknown confounding factors. In addition,
the retrospective nature of this analysis did not allow
us to evaluate the toxicity of IFN and whether dose
adjustments may have influenced the final results.
In summary, this retrospective analysis of
patients with lymph node-positive melanoma sug-

gests that the use of adjuvant IFN may confer a benefit in terms of RFS and that such a benefit is most
striking for those patients with early, –micrometastatic- lymph node disease. Despite the ongoing
debate regarding the risk-benefit ratio of adjuvant
IFN, the current study data support the belief that
patients with stage IIIA melanoma should be
informed that IFN may have better clinical outcomes
than reported in previous trials, which had included
patients with a greater metastatic lymph node tumor
burden and more advanced stage III disease.
