BACKGROUND. BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations are detected in approximately 45% of patients with imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia. Patterns of KD mutations in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are less well studied.
METHODS. The authors assessed KD mutations in patients with recurrent Phpositive ALL after treatments that included 1 or more kinase inhibitors (n 5 24
patients) or no prior kinase inhibitor (KI) therapy (n 5 12 patients).

RESULTS. ABL KD mutations were detected by direct sequencing in 15 of 17
patients (88%) who had recurrent Ph-positive ALL and received prior imatinib
(n 5 16) or dasatinib (n 5 1) treatment and in 6 of 7 patients (86%) who had resistant/recurrent tumors treated with 2 KIs compared with 0 of 12 patients with

CONCLUSIONS. ABL KD mutations, especially at codons 315 and 253, emerged at
the time of disease recurrence in the vast majority of patients who had Ph-positive ALL and received maintenance KI therapy. Thus, the authors concluded that
ongoing KI exposure may alter the patterns of recurrence and favor the out-

CR-ABL kinase domain (KD) point mutations are detected in
the dominant tumor clone(s) in approximately 45% of patients
with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at the time of disease resistance and develop after an average of 20 to 35 months of imatinib
(Gleevec) therapy.1-3 Second- and third-generation kinase inhibitors
(KIs), including dasatinib,4 nilotinib,5 bosutinib,6 INNO-406,6 and
MK-0457,7 are used currently for imatinib-resistant CML, and each
is associated with a somewhat different spectrum of KD mutations
most likely related to the differing sensitivity of mutant clones to
these agents.8,9

(Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is
less clear but has been associated mostly with recurrent disease after treatment with chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with tyrosine KIs
(TKIs).12 Because current therapy for Ph-positive ALL
includes chemotherapy combined with imatinib therapy,13-16 the timing of emergence and the overall pattern of BCR-ABL KD mutations are highly relevant.
Furthermore, the differences between the biology of
lymphoid blast crisis versus de novo Ph-positive ALL
remains unclear.17 To determine the pattern of KD
mutation in Ph-positive ALL, we assessed the patterns of BCR-ABL KD mutations at diagnosis, at the
time of disease recurrence, and after salvage therapy
with second KIs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients with Ph-positive ALL who were seen at our
institution over the previous 5 years and who had
adequate available RNA from an involved sample
(>10% blasts) were analyzed. All but 2 patients were
adults aged >19 years. Diagnostic criteria were those
of the World Health Organization International Histological Classification of Tumors.18 All but 2 patients
had B-cell lineage ALL, which was determined by an
extensive flow-cytometric antigen panel; the remaining 2 patients had myeloid/B-cell biphenotypic lineage ALL. Patients who presented with CML in
lymphoid blast crisis were excluded. Therapy for Phpositive ALL in most patients was hyperfractionated
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) chemotherapy alternating with high-dose cytosine arabinoside and
methotrexate along with imatinib at a dose from 400
to 800 mg/day either with/without vincristine or 6mercaptopurine and methotrexate with/without vincristine and steroids (POMP) as maintenance (individual treatments are summarized in Table 1).13
Patients who presented outside of our institution
were treated initially with a variety of intensive multiagent chemotherapy regimens with 400 to 800 mg/
day of imatinib. Twelve patients with recurrent, Phpositive ALL who had received hyper-CVAD (with or
without rituximab) but no imatinib therapy also were
studied for comparison. Therapy for recurrent disease was variable and included dasatinib (with or
without additional chemotherapy) in 9 patients,4,5
other TKIs in 4 patients, and MK-0457 in 3 patients.7
Eight patients underwent stem cell transplantation in
first or second remission.19
For monitoring of treatment response, BCR-ABL
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were done

every 1 to 3 months on peripheral blood during the
induction phase. Standard cytogenetic analysis of
Giemsa (G)-banded metaphases was done on bone
marrow aspirates, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using BCR-ABL fusion probes
were done along with the PCR studies on blood every
3 months to 6 months during the maintenance phase
and during remission and at recurrence.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative BCR-ABL PCR
White blood cells from bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood specimens were isolated by centrifugation after erythrocyte lysis. Total RNA was
extracted using Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md), and RNA quality was assessed by agarose
gel electrophoresis before complementary DNA synthesis. Real-time quantitative PCR for BCR-ABL was
performed in a 1-tube reaction with normalization to
total ABL levels and post-PCR sizing of fusion transcript products done as described previously.20,21
KD Mutation Detection
To avoid interference from the normal ABL allele, a
nested PCR sequencing approach was used with a
first-round amplification of the BCR-ABL transcript
followed by 2 separate PCR reactions that covered
codons 221 through 380 and codons 350 through 500
of the ABL KD.22 Standard dideoxy chain-termination
DNA sequencing was performed using Big Dye chain
terminator reagents on an ABI3700 analyzer and was
analyzed using Sequence Analysis software V3.3 and
the SeqScape software V2 (ABI, Foster City, Calif).1
All mutations were confirmed by sequencing of forward and reverse strands with a sensitivity of 10%
mutation-bearing transcripts in the analyzed population. The mutation level for direct sequencing is
reported semiquantitatively in Table 1 as only mutant (100%), mostly mutant (75%), mixed (50%), or
mostly unmutated (25%).
For mutation analysis of codons 311-317 and codons 250–255, pyrosequencing was performed after
first-round PCR as described above and with different second-round PCR reactions. Second-round PCR
was performed using a biotin-tagged primer and single-stranded product isolated with avidin-sepharose
beads (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and was
sequenced using an HSQ96 Pyrosequencer (Biotage,
Uppsala, Sweden). The sensitivity of pyrosequencing
was approximately 1% to 5% mutation-bearing transcripts in the total BCR-ABL transcript pool. The
mutation level for pyrosequencing is reported in
Table 1 as the percent mutated product, with an
established precision of 5% for the assay.

RESULTS
BCR-ABL KD Mutations Are Detectable at Recurrence in
KI-treated but Not KI-naive ALL
Overall, 63 samples from 36 Ph-positive patients with
recurrent, Ph-positive ALL were studied, including 24
patients who received KIs as part of their therapy
and 12 patients who had never received KI therapy
before recurrence as a comparison group. There were
34 adults and 2 children (21 men and 15 women;
median age at diagnosis, 45 years; age range, 3–83
years), and the median follow-up was 28 months
(range, 11-96 months). Thirty-three of 36 tumors
(92%) had e1a2 BCR-ABL fusion transcripts associated with the p190 BCR-ABL protein, and the other
tumors had b2a2 or b3a2 BCR-ABL fusion transcripts
that produced the p210 protein.
By using a nested PCR-based assay to directly
sequence the entire ABL KD of the BCR-ABL fusion
transcript, no KD mutations were noted at recurrence in the 12 patients with Ph-positive ALL who
had received no prior KI therapy. The frequency and
pattern of BCR-ABL KD mutation development
among the 24 patients who had received KI therapy
before recurrence are summarized in Table 1. BCRABL KD mutations were noted by direct sequencing
in 15 of 17 patients (88%) who had morphologic evidence of recurrence after only imatinib therapy
(n 5 16 patients) or dasatinib therapy (n 5 1
patient). The sites of KD mutation were Y253H in
6 patients (c.1121T?C); T315I in 4 patients
(c.1308C?T); F317L in 2 patients (c.1315C?A);
E255K (c.1127G?A), P309A (c.1288C?G), E355Q
(c.1427G?C), F359V (c.1439T?G), H396R (c.1551A?
G), and E459K (c.1739G?A) in 1 patient each; and 3
patients had 2 detectable mutations (Fig. 1). All
mutations were detected in peripheral blood or bone
marrow aspirate samples, although concurrent recurrence in the central nervous system commonly was
noted. The median time from diagnosis to mutation
detection was 10 months (range, 6–24 months) with
mutations in codons 253 and 315 developing most
frequently in patients who had received continuous
KI therapy in the preceding months compared with
patients who had some breaks in imatinib maintenance therapy. The 2 patients on imatinib maintenance who developed recurrent disease without
detectable KD mutations also had received intermittent KI therapy.
BCR-ABL KD mutations also were noted in 6 of 7
patients (86%) who presented at our institution with
recurrent/persistent Ph-positive ALL after having
received 2 or more KIs. The sites of KD mutation
were T315I in 4 patients (c.1308C?T); Y253H
(c.1121T?C), F317L (c.1315C?A), and E355G

FIGURE 1. Summary of the location of mutations in the kinase domain
(KD) of BCR-ABL in recurrent Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Illustrated is a schematic representation of the KD,
including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket (P-loop), catalytic domain (C), and activation loop (A). Mutations that developed on imatinib are
indicted by open circles, mutations that developed on dasatinib are indicated
by black circles or triangles, and mutations that developed on nilotinib and
bosutinib are indicated by hatched circles. The hatched lines indicate the
area covered by the pyrosequencing (pyro) mutation assay. Amino acid designations for the mutations are those of the ABL type 1a protein with the following approximate KD subdomains: P-loop 248-256, C-helix/catalytic
domain 276-290, SH3 contact 294-304, additional imatinib-binding pocket
311-318, SH2 contact 331-353, and activation loop 381-402.32

(c.1428A?G) in 1 patient each who received dasatinib after imatinib; and Y253H (c.1121T?C) in 1
patient who received nilotinib after imatinib. One
patient who had previously received imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib (in that order) had 3 KD mutations,
including T315I, F317L, and E355G, and all were present at mixed levels, suggesting 3 distinct clones. The
median duration of KI therapy at the time mutations
were detected was 10 months, and the median time
on second KI therapy was 4 months.
The median follow-up among the cohort of 24
KI-treated patients who developed disease recurrence
was 29 months (range, 11-95 months), and 17 of 24
patients had died of disease at last follow-up (overall
survival: range, 12-95 months).
Table 2 summarizes the cytogenetic findings by
conventional G-banded karyotype among the 24
patients with KI-treated recurrent tumors. Only 2
patients had t(9;22) as the sole abnormality at diagnosis, with extra copies of the Ph chromosome as
indicated by derivative (der) chromosome 22 or more
complex derivative ‘‘marker’’ (mar) chromosomes
observed in 8 patients (all Ph1 amplifications were
confirmed by BCR-ABL fusion FISH studies). In
patients who had complex karyotypes, there usually
was re-emergence of a similar or related clone at the
time of recurrence; however, 6 patients at first or second recurrence had clonal progression or emergence

that observed at diagnosis.

Shifts in KD Mutation Can Occur After Switch to a
Different KI
Table 1 also summarizes the outcome of patients
with KD mutations who switched from one KI to
another. Complete regression of one mutation and
emergence of another was observed in 3 patients
(Patients 1, 7, and 15), such as the complete shift
from E355Q to F317L (c.1315C?A) at 5 months after
a switch from imatinib to dasatinib. By using quantitative pyrosequencing, we noted that persistence and
the level of particular mutations usually paralleled
their predicted sensitivity to particular KIs from in
vitro studies,8,23–25 For example in, 3 patients, F317L
and T315I exhibited no regression with dasatinib
treatment (Patients 5, 18, and 21), but T315I did
regress with MK-0457 therapy in 1 of 3 patients
(Patient 20) and with stem cell transplantation
(Patient 18). These data suggest that, although mutations can develop rapidly in Ph-positive ALL, exposure to a relevant KI is essential for their full
emergence and persistence. Several patients who had
shifts to a new KD mutation with the introduction of
a second TKI had evidence of the emergence of a
distinct clone (Patient 7) or clonal progression
(Patients 1, 15 and 20) by cytogenetic analysis.
BCL-ABL KD Mutations Are Not Detectable at Diagnosis
in Ph-positive ALL
To assess whether significant levels of BCR-ABL transcripts with KD mutations were present before KI

use, we studied the diagnostic samples from 12
patients who ultimately developed a mutation at recurrence and did not detect any KD mutations. By
using a more sensitive quantitative pyrosequencing
assay, we also did not any detect mutations in
Y253H, T315I, or F317L in these samples or in the
initial diagnostic samples from 25 additional patients
with of Ph-positive ALL who did not develop disease
recurrence (not shown). KD mutations also were rare
(2 of 12 patients) in persistent ALL during the first
months of treatment; and, in those patients, mutations were not observed at the mutational hotspots
seen at recurrence (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
We note that BCR-ABL KD mutation in Ph-positive
ALL occurs predominantly in the setting of recurrence after KI maintenance therapy and involves a
restricted subset of mutations that are among the
most resistant in vitro to imatinib and most of the
newer KIs, namely, T315I and Y253H (Figure 2).26
Mutations were not observed at recurrence in those
patients who did not receive KI as part of their treatments.
The higher incidence, rapid emergence, and restricted group of KD mutations observed in this
study among patients who had recurrent, Ph-positive
ALL, compared with patients who had KI-resistant
CML,11,22,27 is similar to another series recently
reported,28 but our results differ in some respects. By
comparing KD mutations present at low levels at the
time of diagnosis, Pfeifer et al. concluded that

Tested were the diagnostic or pre-KI-treated samples from 12 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1 ALL) who eventually developed recurrent disease with a KD
mutation.
{
Tested were samples from patients who had residual Ph1 ALL in the first 6 months of treatment with chemotherapy and KI. Low levels of S438C (c.1674C>G) and Q252H (c.1120G>T) mutations were detected
by direct sequencing in 1 sample each.
§
Tested were 12 samples of recurrent disease from patients with Ph1 ALL who received chemotherapy regimens with no KI.
k
Sixteen patients had received imatinib only, and 1 patient had received dasatinib only before the detection of a KD mutation. Ten of those patients were diagnosed at the authors’ institution (see Table 1), and
the remaining patients were referred for recurrent ALL that was treated elsewhere (see Table 1).

acquired therapy resistance in Ph-positive ALL is
caused in part by mutated BCR-ABL clones that exist
before KI therapy.28 Those authors concluded that
their finding supported the use of KIs as initial therapy to eradicate these pre-existing KD-mutated
populations. Given the absence of a substantial
population of any given KD-mutated clone detectable before mutation growth, our results favor selection after the initiation of KI therapy as the primary
determinant of mutation emergence. In fact, many of
the patients who developed KD mutations at recurrence were on continuous KI therapy from the time
of diagnosis. The rapidity of KD mutation shifts that
we observed in some patients after the introduction
of a different KI (median, 4 months) also supports
rapid KD mutation outgrowth in response to KIdriven selective pressure.
The selective pressure reflected in the high rate
of KD mutation also provides strong evidence that
BCR-ABL expression remains critical to the growth of
Ph-positive ALL at recurrence. The more restricted
sites of BCR-ABL mutations in Ph-positive ALL, compared with KI-resistant CML, may be related to the
need for more active BCR-ABL kinase for growth/
transformation of lymphoid cells versus myeloid
cells. This hypothesis also would be consistent with
the frequent presence in Ph-positive ALL of BCR-ABL
gene amplification, as evidenced by extra Ph chromosomes and the frequent finding of higher BCRABL transcript levels. Effects caused by differences in
the signaling pathways for the p190 versus p210
BCR-ABL protein after KI therapy in lymphoid versus
biphenotypic versus myeloid stem cell populations

BCR-ABL Mutation in ALL/Jones et al

also cannot be excluded. Finally, differences in the
entry, binding, and metabolism of KIs in different
leukocyte populations may influence the selection of
KD-mutated clones in ALL versus CML.
KIs clearly have an important role in therapy
for recurrent, Ph-positive ALL. In particular, it has
been demonstrated that dasatinib is effective for
imatinib-treated, resistant/recurrent, Ph-positive
ALL.29,30 However, the high rate of KD mutation development at recurrence suggests that KI-selected
mutations can promote disease progression and
has implications for the timing and duration of
induction and maintenance therapy with KIs in Phpositive ALL.13 The current data suggest that sequential or combination therapy with both imatinib
and dasatinib preferentially may select for tumor
clones with mutations that mediate resistance to
both agents. The most common mutation that
develops in this setting, T315I, is cross-resistant to
most KIs. Whether chemotherapeutic agents in
maintenance regimens other than KIs play a role in
mediating the outgrowth of mutated clones
deserves further study. In that regard, strategies to
alternate KIs with other therapies during the maintenance phase31 or replacement of KIs with other
cytostatic chemotherapies once mutations are
detected to allow clonal regression may be strategies worth exploring to minimize the biologic selection of resistant disease.
