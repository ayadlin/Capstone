ABSTRACT
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common cancer of the eye in adults. Many
UM patients develop metastases for which no curative treatment has been identified.
Novel therapeutic approaches are therefore urgently needed. UM is characterized by
mutations in the genes GNAQ and GNA11 which activate the PKC pathway, leading
to the use of PKC inhibitors as a rational strategy to treat UM tumors. Encouraging
clinical activity has been noted in UM patients treated with PKC inhibitors. However,
it is likely that curative treatment regimens will require a combination of targeted
therapeutic agents. Employing a large panel of UM patient-derived xenograft models
(PDXs), several PKC inhibitor-based combinations were tested in vivo using the PKC
inhibitor AEB071. The most promising approaches were further investigated in vitro
using our unique panel of UM cell lines. When combined with AEB071, the two agents
CGM097 (p53-MDM2 inhibitor) and RAD001 (mTORC1 inhibitor) demonstrated greater
activity than single agents, with tumor regression observed in several UM PDXs.
Follow-up studies in UM cell lines on these two drug associations confirmed their
combination activity and ability to induce cell death. While no effective treatment
currently exists for metastatic uveal melanoma, we have discovered using our unique
panel of preclinical models that combinations between PKC/mTOR inhibitors and PKC/
p53-MDM2 inhibitors are two novel and very effective therapeutic approaches for this
disease. Together, our study reveals that combining PKC and p53-MDM2 or mTORC1
inhibitors may provide significant clinical benefit for UM patients.

INTRODUCTION

year in western countries, uveal melanoma (UM) remains
a rare malignancy but constitutes the most common
primary intraocular tumor in adults [1]. UM arises in

With an incidence of about 2-8 cases per million per

the pigmented uveal tract including the choroid, ciliary
body and iris [2]. Despite a 10-year local control rate
of 95%, metastases occur in about one third of patients,
developing mainly in the liver (89% of cases) [3]. As a
consequence, the median survival time of metastatic UM
patients ranges from 3 to 12 months [4][5]. Metastatic risk
has been associated with monosomy of chromosome 3 and
loss of expression of the protein BAP1 [6][7]. Systemic
therapy with alkylating agents have shown only modest
efficacy [8] and no systemic treatment has been capable
of increasing survival. New therapeutic approaches and
particularly new targeted therapies are therefore warranted
[2][5][9].
More than 80% of UM have mutations in the genes
GNAQ and GNA11, which encode for small GTPases
[10]. These mutations are mutually exclusive, affecting
46% and 35% of UM cases respectively [11][12][13].
Oncogenic signaling as a result of GNAQ/11 mutations is
reported to hyperactivate the PLCβ/PKC/MAPK pathway
(14][15][16]. Indeed, an anti-proliferative effect has been
observed in vitro using both PKC and MEK inhibitors [16]
[17]. While the PKCi AEB071 could induce a GNAQQ209Ldependent tumor growth inhibition in vivo, no sustained
MAPK pathway inhibition could be achieved and
inhibition of PKC alone was unable to trigger cell death in
vitro and/or tumor regression in vivo [16]. Combination of
AEB071 with the MEK inhibitor Binimetinib (MEK162)
led to sustained inhibition of MAPK activity and
significant in vivo tumor growth inhibition [16]. A phase
I dose-escalation study of AEB071 in UM metastatic
patients showed encouraging signs of clinical activity
but overall the efficacy was relatively modest [18]. Two
different MEK inhibitors have been investigated in clinical
trials and showed a slight benefit for UM patients [19][20]
[21].
Our current knowledge of UM biology has led
us to consider novel combination approaches, such as
co-targeting PKC and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway,
MDM2/p53 signaling or cell cycle regulation. First,
activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in UM has been
suggested by several reports [22][23][24] and anti-tumor
activity has been observed in UM models using various
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors [25][26][27].
Moreover, a synergistic effect has been described after
combination of AEB071 with the PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719
in vitro and in vivo [27]. Second, while p53 mutations are
not common in UM [28], several studies have shown
that UM have an inactivated p53 pathway, due to (i) high
expression of the protein MDM2 [28][29][30][31][32] and
(ii) downregulation of the protein PERP in aggressive UM
[33][34]. Furthermore, the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 was
shown to reduce UM cell proliferation in a p53-dependent
manner [35]. Third, a high cyclin D1 expression as well
as a strong nuclear staining for Rb have been observed
in UM patients [29][30][31], suggesting that targeting
CDK4/6 activity could be a valuable therapeutic strategy.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Using a large panel of UM models [26][36][37],
we evaluated combinations of the PKCi AEB071 with
compounds targeting MEK1/2 (MEK162), p53-MDM2
(CGM097), mTORC1 (Everolimus/RAD001) and
CDK4/6 (Ribociclib/LEE011). We first performed an in
vivo combination screen in five different Patient-Derived
Xenograft models (PDXs). Promising combinations were
further investigated in vitro in our panel of UM cell lines
with the goal to define the modality of action of these
combinations and to build strong preclinical data for
effective translation into UM clinical trials.

RESULTS
PKC and p53-MDM2 targeted inhibitors are
consistently active in UM PDXs when dosed as
single agents
We first evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of
AEB071 in five UM PDXs: MP42, MP46, MP55, MM33
and MM52 (Supplementary Figure S1A; Tables S1 and
S2). AEB071 was orally administered twice daily at a dose
of 120 or 240 mg/kg/day. A dose-dependent efficacy of
AEB071 was observed in all models, with a significantly
higher tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at the highest dose
in all PDXs. The degree of AEB071 efficacy was variable
depending on the PDXs with MP42 and MP46 models
showing the highest sensitivity to PKCi.
With a view to evaluating AEB071-based
combination regimens, four targeted agents were first
tested as single agents in the same models. Compounds
targeting MEK1/2 (MEK162), mTORC1 (RAD001), p53MDM2 (CGM097) and CDK4/6 (LEE011) were tested
alongside the lower AEB071 daily dose of 120 mg/kg
to avoid any risk of toxicity when tested in combination.
MEK162, RAD001 and CGM097 were tested in five
PDXs while LEE011 was evaluated only in three models.
As shown in Supplementary Figure S1B and Table
S3, treatment with MEK162 or LEE011 showed a modest
TGI in the five PDX models from 13-50% for MEK162
or around 35% for LEE011. Treatment with RAD001
gave similar responses in three out of five PDXs but had a
higher anti-tumor activity in MM33 and MM52, reaching a
TGI of 70% and 71% respectively. Interestingly, treatment
with CGM097 reduced tumor growth to a higher extent
in all PDXs, from 56 to 90% of TGI. Notably, response
to AEB071 treatment was similar to the previous doseresponse experiment, except for one model (MP46).
When looking at the overall response rate (ORR; see
Supplementary Materials), AEB071, MEK162, LEE011,
RAD001, CGM097 induced an ORR lower than -0.5 in
32%, 22%, 13%, 34%, and 70% respectively, confirming
CGM097 as the most efficient agent (Supplementary
Figure S2 and Table S3).

We next compared the overall efficacy across all
tested compounds except LEE011. For each PDX model,
we ranked the efficacy of all tested agents using a scoring
method: a therapy was classified from 1 (more efficient
treatment) to 4 (less efficient treatment) using the TGI
criteria. The sum of the scores for each of the five PDXs
was calculated for each compound and defined as the final
score (Supplementary Table S4). While AEB071, MEK162
and RAD001 scored as 15, 14 and 13 respectively, the
total score for CGM097 was 8, underlining the superior
efficacy of this p53-MDM2 inhibitor over the other
compounds, including AEB071.

AEB071 + CGM097 (Figures 1 and 2; Supplementary
Table S5). Indeed, AEB071 + RAD001 co-treatment
induced a significant TGI in three models with two tumor
regressions (MP42, MM33) and one tumor stabilization
(MM52). Combination activity was detected in two
models (MP42 and MM33) (Figure 2). Strikingly, the
AEB071 + CGM097 combination strongly reduced tumor
growth, leading to tumor regression or stasis in all five
PDX models. Combination activity was observed in four
models (MP42, MP46, MP55, MM33) (Figure 2).
Similarly as AEB071 + CGM097, the AEB071 +
MEK162 combination induced significant TGI in all five
PDXs associated with combination activity in four models
(Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S4). However, its
global anti-tumor effect was more modest than AEB071
+ CGM097 treatment, with only one model showing
tumor regression and a reduced tumor progression in
the other PDXs. Treatment with AEB071 + LEE011 did
not significantly enhance the effect of either AEB071 or
LEE011 used alone (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure
S5).
We used our scoring system to compare the
efficacy of all combinations except the one with LEE011.
Combinations of AEB071 + MEK162, AEB071 +
RAD001 and AEB071 + CGM097 scored as 13, 9 and 8

Dual inhibition of PKC with mTORC1 or PKC
with p53-MDM2 induces significant anti-tumor

Results of the combinations between AEB071 and
MEK162, RAD001, CGM097 or LEE011 are summarized
in Figures 1 and 2, Supplementary Figures S3-S5 and
Tables S5 and S6.
When comparing the efficacy of all combinations
across the five PDX models, two combinations showed
higher anti-tumor responses: AEB071 + RAD001 and

respectively (Supplementary Table S4). While assessment
of monotherapy efficacy underlined the clear superiority
of CGM097, two combinations appeared to be equivalent
in our panel of UM PDXs, namely AEB071 + RAD001
and AEB071 + CGM097. The significant increase of
efficacy of AEB071 + RAD001 combination compared
to monotherapies suggests a possible synergistic effect
between these two compounds, while co-treatment of
AEB071 with CGM097 seems to be additive.
Overall, our in vivo findings show that targeting of
PKC and p53-MDM2 or PKC and mTORC1 are effective
combination strategies for GNAQ/11 mutated UM PDXs,
with tumor regressions often observed after PKC and p53MDM2 inhibition.

Identification of predictive
response to treatments

biomarkers

Treatment with AEB071 led to decreased phospho-PKCδ
(pPKCδ) in all PDXs confirming activity of the compound
and inhibition of the PKC pathway. In the three models
that are sensitive to RAD001 (MM33, MM52, MP42),
we observed a decreased in phospho-S6 (pS6) levels after
RAD001 treatment, confirming that RAD001 blocked
mTORC1 activity in these models. We did not observe
such a decrease in the two non-responders to RAD001,
MP46 and MP55 (Supplementary Figure S6). Thus,
RAD001 failed to block mTORC1 activity in these two
PDXs, which may explain their absence of response to
RAD001. Given that CGM097 blocks protein-protein
interaction between p53 and MDM2 and MDM2 is an E3
ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation by the
proteasome, CGM097 treatment should lead to increased
expression of p53, which in turn should result in increased
expression of p21 (a direct transcriptional target of p53).
This was indeed observed in all PDXs, confirming that
CGM097 was active in vivo with the chosen dosage
schedule (Supplementary Figure S7).
Next, we sought for biomarkers in various available
sets of molecular data on our UM PDXs (untreated),
namely gene mutations, gene expression profiles and

of

To get more insights into molecular mechanisms of
response and/or resistance observed with these treatments,
we first analyzed the pharmacodynamics markers for each
compound in order to confirm target engagement and
pathway inhibition (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7).

expression. Since no significant differential response
among the models was observed for MEK162, CGM097
and their combinations with AEB071, we focused on the
other treatments and combinations. Neither the mutation
patterns (Supplementary Table S1) nor the analysis of
gene expression profiles (Supplementary Figure S8) could

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

identify a signature of response to the drugs. RPPA data
allowed to identify a few potential proteins correlated to
response (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). They include
PKCα for AEB071 and proteins of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway in the combination therapy with RAD0001.
These potential predictive biomarkers would need to be
confirmed on a larger dataset including more models.

was observed (Mel202 and MM66) and two cell lines in
which no combination activity was observed (Mel290
and RPE1) are presented in Figure 3C and 3D and
Supplementary Figure S15B. It is important to note that,
for both combinations, all GNAQ/11 mutated cell lines,
with the exception of the MM28 model, have overall
higher synergy scores and Amax values compared to
control lines. This observation highlights the value of
these combinations for GNAQ/11 mutated UM models
and reveals a potential for achieving a therapeutic window
using these drug combination approaches.
Even if the AEB071 + MEK162 association led to
the highest synergy among our panel of cell lines, our
in vivo experiments demonstrated that this combination
was less efficient in vivo than AEB071 + RAD001 and
AEB071 + CGM097 co-treatments. Indeed, taking all
mice and all models together, 29% of mice had an ORR
inferior to -0.75 after AEB071 + MEK162 treatment,
whereas 49% and 79% of mice showed similar response
under AEB071 + RAD001 and AEB071 + CGM097
associations respectively (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Table S5). These results confirm the overall superior in
vivo efficacy of AEB071 combined with RAD001 or
CGM097.

In order to further understand the underlying
mechanism of combination activity, the AEB071-based
combinations with MEK162, RAD001 and CGM097 were
tested in our panel of UM cell lines (Supplementary Table
S9).
Each pairwise combination was tested at multiple
concentrations using a five dose matrix. The dose range
for each drug was adjusted according to preliminary
experiments. AEB071, MEK162 and CGM097 were tested
from 0 to 2µM, while the maximal dose used for RAD001
was 0.1µM. Since 92.1 and MM66 cells were highly
sensitive to AEB071 treatment and had a much lower IC50
compared to the other cell lines, the top dose for AEB071
was set at 0.5µM in these two models. Synergy score and
isobolograms were generated to quantify the combination
strength using the Loewe algorithm. A synergy score
higher than 2 was considered as significant (see Methods)
[38].
The dose response curves for each drug used as a
single agent are depicted in Supplementary Figures S9S11. While AEB071, MEK162 and CGM097 showed
varying degrees of growth inhibition depending on the
cell line, ranging from 24-99% for the highest chosen
dose, the maximal growth inhibitory effect obtained with
RAD001 was approximately 50% as previously observed
(Supplementary Table S10) [25]. Notably and as expected,
AEB071 did not affect the proliferation of control cells
that do not harbor GNAQ/11mutation.
All combination results are summarized in
Supplementary Figures S12-S14. Importantly, for the
three combinations, co-treatment of the two agents led
to an enhanced anti-proliferative effect compared to the
corresponding monotherapies for most of the tested doses
and in the majority of GNAQ/11 mutated models.
To determine to which extent co-inhibition of PKC
with MEK1/2, mTORC1 or p53-MDM2 have combination
activity in UM cell lines compared to control lines,
results were represented as a dot plot showing, for each
cell line, the synergy score and Amax value, with the
Amax corresponding to the maximal growth inhibition
effect seen in the combination treatment (Figure 3A
and 3B; Supplementary Figure S15). We observed that
the combination between of AEB071 and MEK162
or RAD001 were more synergistic compared to the
combination between of AEB071 and CGM097. Indeed,
AEB071 + MEK162 and AEB071 + RAD001 treatments
resulted in synergy scores higher than 2 for 63.6 % (7
out of 11) and 54.5 % (6 out of 11) of GNAQ/11 mutated
UM cell lines respectively [39]. In contrast, AEB071 +
CGM097 co-treatment gave rise to synergy scores around
1 for all GNAQ/11 mutated UM models, indicating that
this combination was rather additive. Results from two

Co-inhibition of PKC and mTORC1 or PKC and
p53-MDM2 leads to induction of apoptosis in
most GNAQ/11 mutated UM cell lines
To assess whether the two combinations that are the
most efficient in vivo lead to growth arrest or apoptosis
in our cell line models, we followed their growth during
nine days of treatment with DMSO and each drug alone
or in combination. Molecular studies were performed
in parallel to confirm target engagement and pathway
inhibition as well as to look for apoptosis (Figures 4 and
5; Supplementary Figures S16-S17).
We observed that co-treatment of AEB071 and
RAD001 led to an enhanced loss of viability compared
to monotherapies only in GNAQ/11 mutated models.
The combination effect was stronger in cell lines with
lower responses to AEB071 used as a single agent
(MP41, MP46, MP65, MM66). Overall, the combination
treatment led to a loss of viability in all GNAQ/11 mutated
lines (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S16A). We
next measured apoptosis using western blot analyses
for cleaved PARP (cPARP) after three days of treatment
(Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S16B). In all of the
six representative GNAQ/11 mutated cell lines, AEB071
slightly induced cPARP. The combination with RAD001
led to a significantly stronger increase in cPARP in four
out of six lines (92.1, Mel202, MP46, MP65), highlighting
the enhanced apoptosis triggered by the combination
treatment (see quantification of cPARP/GAPDH). In the
other cell types for which cytostasis was observed in the

proliferation assay, no induction of cPARP was detected
(Supplementary Figure S16B). To get a more precise
measurement of apoptosis, we performed AnnexinV
staining. The induction of apoptosis by the combination
treatment compared to monotherapies was confirmed in
five of the eleven tested cell lines (MP46, MP65, MM66,
Mel270, OMM2.5) (Supplementary Figures S18-S20). In
conclusion, evidence of apoptosis (cleaved-PARP and/or
AnnexinV staining) was observed in at least seven cell
lines after three days of treatment. The effect of the coinhibition of PKC and mTORC1 was less pronounced in
vitro than in vivo, most likely due to the effect of RAD001
on non-tumor cells surrounding the tumor in in vivo
settings.
Finally, target engagement and pathway inhibition
were confirmed for both inhibitors (Figure 4B and
Supplementary Figure S16B). Validation of AEB071
activity was done using the markers phosphorylated
MARCKS (pMARCKS) and pPKCδ, while pS6 was
used for RAD001. In all models, GNAQ/11 mutated and
wt, AEB071 treatment led to decreased pMARCKS and
pPKCδ. Likewise, RAD001 treatment decreased the
amount of pS6 in all models. Co-treatment with AEB071
and RAD001 did not alter the level of pathway inhibition
seen with single agents.
Like the combination of AEB071 + RAD001,
combination of AEB071 and CGM097 further blocked
cell proliferation compared to single agent treatment
in most GNAQ/11 mutated cell lines (Figure 5A and
Supplementary Figure S17A). The control lines did
respond to CGM097 but not to AEB071, and their
combination of both did not enhance the effect of
CGM097 monotherapy in these models.
Effectiveness of each drug at the concentration used
was verified using their corresponding pharmacodynamic
markers. Treatment with AEB071 led to decreased
pMARCKS and pPKCδ confirming activity of the
compound and inhibition of the PKC pathway. Increased
expression of p53 and its target p21 confirmed that 1µM
of CGM097 was sufficient to inhibit MDM2 function and
to activate the p53 pathway.
We next evaluate apoptosis by first looking at cPARP
expression (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure 17B).
92.1, Mel202, MP41, MP46 and Mel270 cells showed an
increase of cPARP levels in the combination treatment
compared to DMSO control and single agents. The MM66
cell line did not show an increase in cPARP, while a loss
of viability under AEB071 + CGM097 treatment was
observed in the growth curve assay. It is possible that the
ATP release as a read-out of cell number or the time point
used for the WB analyses were not appropriate to correlate
both studies. AnnexinV staining was used to better
quantify apoptosis and confirmed that the combination
treatment strongly induced apoptosis in five cellular
models (92.1, Mel202, MP46, MM66, Mel270) compared
to DMSO or monotherapies (Supplementary Figures 21www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

23).

Interestingly, when comparing all cell lines together,
the induction of apoptosis by AEB071 + CGM097 was
much stronger than the one observed with AEB071 +
RAD001 (see quantification of cPARP/GAPDH in Figures
4B and 5B; AnnexinV staining in Supplementary Figures
S15-18 and S20-21), reinforcing our previous finding
of the higher in vivo efficacy of AEB071 + CGM097
combination on AEB071 + RAD001 treatment.
In conclusion, our in vitro findings show that
co-inhibition of PKC and mTORC1 or PKC and p53MDM2 are effective combination strategies for GNAQ/11
mutated UM models. Both co-treatments led to induction
of apoptosis in most of the cellular models tested, with a
stronger cell death observed with combination of PKC and
p53-MDM2 inhibitors.

DISCUSSION
About one third of UM patients develop metastases
for which no curative treatment exists. Due to mutations
in GNAQ/11 genes and subsequent activation of the PKC
pathway, the PKC inhibitor AEB071 has been tested in
preclinical and clinical settings. Although treatment
with AEB071 as a single agent resulted in tumor stasis
in 50% of UM patients and a progression free survival
of 15 weeks, our evolving hypothesis is that combination
treatment including a PKCi will result in an improved
clinical response. Taking advantage of our large panel of
UM preclinical models, we have evaluated the efficacy of
four AEB071-based combinations in five PDX models,
with in vitro validation for the most promising approaches.
Through this work, we have discovered two novel
promising therapeutic strategies by co-targeting PKC and
mTORC1 or PKC and p53-MDM2.
Based on our current knowledge of UM, we
initially tested combinations targeting PKC with
MEK1/2, CDK4/6, mTORC1 or p53-MDM2. Due to
the hyperactivated MAPK pathway and the absence of
sustained inhibition of MAPK signaling with PKCi alone,
combination of PKCi + MEKi has been considered as
a good therapeutic strategy. In our study, treatment of
AEB071 + MEK162 showed good synergy in our panel
of UM cellular models and led to a significant reduction
of tumor growth in all PDXs, but without clear tumor
stabilization or regression as opposed to what was
described in UM xenograft models [16]. A multicenter
phase II clinical trial was conducted to assess this
combination in metastatic UM patients but was closed
early due to toxicity issues. Optimization of dose and
dosing regimen as well as the use of alternative MEKi
or PKCi may further improve the therapeutic index and
clinical benefit to patients of this combination. Because
of high cyclin D1 and Rb expressions observed in UM
[29][30][31], we evaluated the combination of PKCi +
CDK4/6i using AEB071 and LEE011 compounds. Only
33551

Oncotarget

a limited efficacy of LEE011 was observed and no clear
evidence of increased efficacy combining it with AEB071
was detected, indicating that co-inhibition of PKC and
CDK4/6 is not an optimal strategy for treating UM. The
absence of increased efficacy after AEB071 + LEE011
combination could be in part explained by the fact that
AEB071 decreases expression of cyclin D1 and Rb
proteins and induces G1/S cell cycle arrest [16][17][40],
effects that are specific to CDK4/6 targeting.
Two combinations appear as promising approaches
in our in vivo combination screen. Dual inhibition of
PKC and mTORC1 (AEB071 + RAD001) was able to
significantly reduce tumor growth compared to each
monotherapy, with two tumor regressions and one tumor
stabilization observed. More strikingly, co-targeting of
PKC and p53-MDM2 (AEB071 + CGM097) led to tumor
stasis or regression in all five PDX models. Importantly,
similar results were obtained using our panel of cell lines.
Both combinations induced apoptosis or growth arrest in
most GNAQ/11 mutated cell lines, reinforcing the value of
these combination regimens for UM.
Data mining of mutations, gene expressions
and RPPA profiles of our PDXs could not allow the
identification of predictive biomarkers of response. This
is most probably due to the low number of models and
the fact that, in some therapeutic situations, all or almost
all models are responding to treatment (CGM097 and
CGM097-based combinations). Clinical trials with
tumor sample collection on a higher number of patients
might allow the identification and the validation of such
biomarkers.
To further understand the mechanism of combination
activity, we evaluated the synergy between AEB071 +
RAD001 and AEB071 + CGM097. We observed that,
for most GNAQ/11 mutated UM cell lines, the AEB071
+ RAD001 combination was synergistic while AEB071
+ CGM097 co-treatment was additive. We could make
a similar conclusion using our scoring method in vivo,
indicating that PKC and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
may be connected while the PKC and MDM2/p53
signaling may be independent molecular cascades. More
in depth studies are required to understand these positive
combination activities. In particular, the combination
between AEB071 and BYL719 (a PI3Kα inhibitor)
has shown some efficacy in preclinical studies [27]. To
decipher if the mechanism of PKC + mTORC1 inhibition
is similar than the one of PKC + PI3Kα, it would be
interested to compare them with an association of PKCi
with dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors. Our study also
clearly demonstrates that an additive combination with a
high combination Amax value could still be beneficial and
can translate to in vivo tumor regressions, and thus should
be taken into account when similar in vitro combination
screens are performed.
Notably, our results were independent of BAP1
status. BAP1 is important for tumor progression; however
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

some BAP1-positive patients still develop metastases,
suggesting that other pathways are important to drive
metastatic outgrowth. In contrast, the effects of the
combinations were associated with GNAQ/11 status,
indicating that mutated GNAQ/11 proteins are likely to
be UM drivers.
Our preclinical approach allows the identification
of novel therapeutic approaches for UM patients and
provides a solid preclinical package for a translation into
clinical trials. This method should therefore be applied
to test novel targets/compounds, such as molecules
targeting the Hippo/YAP pathway, recently discovered as
upregulated in UM [41].
In conclusion, we have shown that dual inhibition
of PKC + p53-MDM2 and PKC + mTORC1 are more
efficacious than other previously tested combinations in
UM, with striking tumor regression observed in several in
vivo models after co-targeting of PKC and p53-MDM2.
Moreover, our study provides a strong rationale to test
these combinations in the clinical setting for metastatic
UM patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Uveal melanoma preclinical models
Five PDXs representative of the UM disease
were used: MP42, MP46, MP55, MM33 and MM52
(Supplementary Table S1). The main molecular features
of these PDXs have been described in [35][36].
	 Fifteen in vitro cellular models, isolated
either from primary tumors or metastases, were used
(Supplementary Table S9). MP38, MP41, MP46, MP65,
MM28 and MM66 cell lines were established in our
laboratory as described in [26]. These cell lines were
characterized by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Method
(Promega, GenePrint 10 System). 92.1 and Mel202 cell
lines were purchased from The European Searchable
Tumour Line Database (Tubingen University, Germany);
MRC5 and RPE1 lines from ATCC. OMM1, OMM2.5,
Mel285 and Mel290 cells were kindly provided by P.A.
Van Der Velden (Leiden University, The Netherlands) and
genotyped as described in [26]. Two primary cultures of
normal melanocytes isolated from a human choroid were
kindly given by G. Liot (Institut Curie, France). All culture
conditions are described in the Supplementary Materials.

Compounds
All drugs used in this study (AEB071, CGM097,
RAD001, MEK162, LEE011) were obtained from
Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR,
Cambridge, USA). AEB071, MEK162, RAD001,
CGM097 and LEE011 are selective inhibitors of PKC,
33552

Drug combination cell viability assay

MEK1/2, mTORC1, MDM2 and CDK4/6 respectively.
For in vivo administration, compounds were diluted in
20% propylene glycol + 50% solutol + 30% PBS. The
control groups were treated with this solution (vehicle).
Each compound was administrated 5 days a week at the
dose indicated in each figure legend (see Supplementary
Materials for further details).
	 For in vitro experiments, compound powders
were dissolved in DMSO for a stock concentration of
10mM final, aliquoted and stored at -20°C. Further
dilutions were made according to each experiment design.

Cells were seeded at appropriate concentration in
three 96-well plates following a 6x6 matrix design. The
day after, each drug was added following a matrix dilution
format. 1:3 serial dilutions were tested to result in a total
of six serial dilutions, including the DMSO control. Cell
viability was measured after five days of drug treatment
using the MTT assay (Sigma). Results were read using a
spectrophotometer, and expressed as relative percentages
of metabolically inactive cells compared with DMSOtreated controls (percentage of growth inhibition). All
different combinations were tested on the whole cell line
panel for each experimental procedure. The tests were
repeated until at least an independent duplicate for each
drug combination was obtained.

In vivo drug testing experiments
Tumor fragments of 30-60mm3 were grafted
subcutaneously into the interscapular fat pad of four to
six week-old mice. When tumors reached a size of about
50-150mm3, mice were randomly assigned to control or
treatment groups. Between six to nine mice per group
were included in each experiment. Mice were sacrificed
when their tumor reached a volume of 2500mm3. There
were two sets of in vivo independent experiments: a
first one testing dose-dependent efficacy of AEB071
administered alone, and a second one testing AEB071 (120
mg/kg) alone and in combinations (AEB071+RAD001/
CGM097/MEK162/LEE011). Hence, in this second set of
experiments, control groups are similar in each model for
all tested combinations, and the doses of each compound
were identical in all tested combinations and in each
model.
Tumor growth was evaluated using standard
methods and is described in the Supplementary Materials.
Studies have been performed in compliance with
the recommendations of the French Ethical Committee
and under the supervision of authorized investigators.
The experimental protocol and animal housing followed
institutional guidelines as put forth by the French Ethical
Committee (Agreement C75-05 -18, France) and the ethics
committee of Institut Curie.

Evaluation of in vitro combination activity
Combination effects were calculated with the
Combination Analysis Module software, a Novartis inhouse software application which implements the full set
of combination analysis methods as described by Lehar et
al. [38][42]. A weighted “Synergy Score” was calculated
across the dose matrix that adjusts for dose sampling and
coverage and weights to favor combination effects at
high inhibition levels. A synergy score higher than 2 was
considered as significant when compared to the variation
of synergy scores seen within self-crosses (drug-with-self;
theoretical synergy score of 0).

Growth curve assay and evaluation of loss of
viability
At day 0, cells were plated in triplicate at appropriate
concentration in 96-well plates. Four conditions were
tested for each cell line: DMSO, Drug A, Drug B and Drug
A+B. At day 1, each drug was added to each well. Optimal
drug concentrations were chosen from the combination
experiments: AEB071 was used at 500nM, RAD001 at
100nM and CGM097 at 1µM. The amount of DMSO was
adjusted to 0.2% in each mix to get the same percentage
of DMSO for each treatment condition. Compounds were
replenished at day 6. At day 3, day 6 and day 9, viability
was measured using the CellTiterGlo assay (Promega).
The average between triplicates was made and represented
± SEM. All cell lines were tested at the same time and
at least two independent experiments were performed to
confirm results reproducibility.

Statistical tests for in vivo experiments
Two by two comparison of TGI observed in two
arms was done using a two-sided Mann-Whitney test
based on the RTVV. For all pairwise comparisons based on
the proportions of tumors with a particular RTV or ORR,
a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used. All statistical
tests were carried out bilaterally calculating two-tailed
p-values. Results were considered statistically significant
when p ≤ 0.05 (95% confidence interval).

Western blot analyses
Cells were cultured in 10 cm-diameter dishes
and treated with DMSO or each drug as single agent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or combination for 72h. Western blot analyses were
performed using standard procedures. GAPDH was used
for normalization between samples. Primary antibodies
were diluted in TBST + 0.5% BSA at an appropriate
dilution and incubated overnight at 4°C. All antibodies
used in this study are listed in Supplementary Materials.
Signal was detected using secondary antibodies coupled
with HRP (Jackson laboratory). Luminescent signal was
detected using a LAS-3000 Luminescent Image analyzer.
Four tumors per therapeutic group have been analyzed.
