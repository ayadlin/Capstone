BACKGROUND. Studies of cancer risk and molecular carcinogenesis suggest a role
for inflammation in cancer development and progression. The authors sought to
determine whether specific blood proteins associated with inflammation predict
for outcomes in men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer
(AIPC) who are initiating docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

METHODS. Baseline plasma samples were stored (2808C) from 160 of 250 patients
enrolled in the AIPC Study of Calcitriol ENhancing Taxotere (ASCENT) trial, a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing weekly docetaxel plus high-dose
calcitriol with weekly docetaxel. Multiplex immunoassays measured 16 cytokine,
chemokine, cardiovascular, or inflammatory markers. The Cox proportional
hazards model was used to assess associations between baseline biomarkers,
clinical characteristics, and survival. Logistic regression was used for analyses of
associations with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline.

and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with docetaxel-containing chemotherapy. The improved ability to more accurately predict individual survival and
response to therapy would improve the ability to
inform patients, clinical decision-making, interpretation of clinical trial results, and clinical trial design
through proper stratification of patients by risk. To
our knowledge to date, the most well-known efforts
to develop prognostic models in AIPC have focused
on multivariate analyses of clinically available variables such as age; performance status; Gleason score;
the presence or absence of visceral disease; and of
commonly available measurements of blood proteins
such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations and kinetics, hemoglobin (HGB), and alkaline phosphatase. Such
analyses have identified several independent clinical
and biochemical predictors of survival and led to the
development of useful nomograms.3,4
A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that both local and systemic inflammation play
an important role in the development and progression of a variety of common solid tumors, likely
through the paracrine actions of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and mediators of angiogenesis generated by the inflammatory response to
the tumor.5–8 Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
and fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are among the
inflammatory substances believed to contribute to
the growth and progression of cancer.7–9 Indeed, the
development of many cancers has been directly
linked to specific infectious and inflammatory
insults.6 The mechanism believed to be responsible
for the effects of inflammation on cancer have
recently been reviewed.10
To our knowledge the role of inflammation in
prostate carcinogenesis and prostate cancer progression has not been fully elucidated, but evidence supporting this hypothesis is mounting. Prostatic
inflammatory atrophy, a candidate early preneoplastic lesion, is associated with a prominent inflammatory component.11 Inflammatory T-cell infiltrates
accompany prostate cancer.12 Autoantibodies to
prostate cancer antigens are frequently detectable in
prostate cancer patients. A panel testing for prostate
cancer autoantibodies has recently been shown to be
a sensitive and specific test with which to distinguish
between men who do from those who do not harbor
prostate cancer.13
Although not universally consistent, epidemiologic studies that examine prostate cancer risk and use
of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
suggest that inflammation may be a modifiable risk

factor for the development of clinically evident prostate cancer.14–16
Specific inflammatory cytokines as well as nonspecific measures of systemic inflammation such as
C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and HGB have
been found to be strongly correlated with prognosis in
patients with a broad variety of common cancers.17
We hypothesized that inflammation is associated
with shorter OS and a lower probability of PSA
decline in AIPC patients initiating docetaxel-based
chemotherapy. Furthermore, we hypothesized that
the measurement of blood markers of inflammation
would yield novel prognostic and predictive factors
in advanced prostate cancer. We tested these hypotheses using samples and clinical outcomes data from
the ASCENT (AIPC Study of Calcitriol ENhancing
Taxotere) study, a double-blind randomized phase 2
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose
calcitriol plus weekly docetaxel compared with placebo plus weekly docetaxel in AIPC. Based on our exploratory study of 16 different cytokine, chemokine,
or inflammatory markers from 160 patients participating in ASCENT, we report that CRP, a readily available measure of systemic inflammation in the blood,
is a significant predictor of OS and PSA decline in
response to docetaxel-based chemotherapy in men
with metastatic AIPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Detailed eligibility criteria and the treatment regimen
have been previously described.18 Briefly, men with
metastatic AIPC and no prior chemotherapy received
DN-101 (45 mg of calcitriol) or placebo by mouth on
Day 1 followed by docetaxel at a dose of 36 mg/m2
intravenously on Day 2 along with dexamethasone
(4 mg administered orally 12 hours before, 1 hour
before, and 12 hours after docetaxel administration).
This regimen was administered weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of a 4-week cycle. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists were continued in
those patients who had not undergone orchiectomy.
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for
all participating institutions and informed consent
was obtained from all patients contributing samples.
Sample Handling and Assays
Blood samples were collected before therapy from
160 patients enrolled in the ASCENT study. Plasma
was separated by centrifugation at 3000 revolutions
per minute (rpm), stored at 2808C, and shipped
frozen to a central repository. Multiplex immunoassays (Linco Research, St. Charles, Mo) using uni-

quely labeled fluorescent microspheres conjugated to
anticytokine capture antibodies were used to simultaneously measure IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,
IL-10, TNF-a, monocyte chemotactic peptide-1
(MCP-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), VEGF, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), soluble E selectin (sESelectin), soluble intracellular adhesion molecule
(sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule
(sVCAM-1), and CRP from blinded plasma samples
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.
After a conventional sandwich immunoassay, beads
were washed of unbound or excess proteins and read
on a Luminex100 system (Austin, Tex) to determine
the concentration of the biomarker of interest. When
appropriate, samples were diluted to be accurately
measured within the dynamic range of the assay.
Values below the lower limit of detection or above the
upper limit of detection were set to the lower limit or
upper limit, respectively. All samples were tested in
duplicate and mean values were used for all analyses.

Statistical Methods
The efficacy endpoints of interest were OS and overall confirmed PSA decline.19 OS was defined as the
time from randomization to death from any cause.
PSA decline was defined as a 50% reduction from
baseline PSA that was confirmed by another measurement at least 28 days later. OS was censored at
78 weeks for all subjects. Because of the skewed distribution of raw biomarker data, a natural logarithmic transformation was applied to all values to
achieve a more normal distribution before inclusion

in the models. A proportional hazards model was
used to assess the correlation between the baseline
biomarkers and clinical covariates on OS whereas
logistic regression was used to assess the correlation
between the baseline biomarkers and PSA decline.
Variables in both models were selected using a backwards selection method with an a level of 0.05. Receiver operator curves (ROCs) for OS at 78 weeks
were plotted using the method of Heagerty et al.20

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
Two hundred and fifty patients were randomized at
48 sites from the U.S. and Canada between September 2002 and January 2004. Samples adequate for
analysis obtained before treatment were available
from 160 of these patients. Baseline characteristics
were similar to those of the 90 patients without
samples, except for a somewhat lower age (mean of
68.0 years vs 70.6 years), higher baseline HGB (12.8 g/
dL vs 12.2 g/dL), and race (African-American 7.5% vs
18.9%) in the patients with samples available. Baseline
characteristics of the 2 groups are shown in Table 1. All
remaining analyses refer to the 160 patients who
provided blood samples.
Biomarkers and OS
Each of the measured biomarkers was included in a
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to
determine the extent to which the level of the biomarker was predictive of OS. Of the 16 analyses
tested, CRP was the only biomarker found to be in-

dependently associated with OS (hazards ratio [HR]
of 1.41; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.199–
1.647 [P < .0001]) (Table 2). This translates to a 41%
increase in hazards of mortality for each 2.72-fold
increase in CRP or a 27% increase in the hazards of
mortality for each doubling of the CRP.
When categorized as normal (8 mg/L) or elevated (>8 mg/L), an elevated CRP plasma level was
determined to be a significant predictor of shorter
OS (adjusted HR of 2.96; 95% CI, 1.52–5.77
[P 5 .001]), as was HGB (P 5 .007). The impact of an
elevated baseline CRP on OS is shown in Figure 1.
It is interesting to note that the distribution of
CRP concentrations in the current study patients, as
shown in Figure 2, was broad and skewed. Quartile 1
ranged from 0.2 to 4.2 mg/L, quartile 2 ranged
from 4.2 to 12.7 mg/L, quartile 3 ranged from 12.7

to 43.5 mg/L, and quartile 4 ranged from 43.5 to
500 mg/L (Fig. 2) and 64% of these men had elevated
CRP values (>8 mg/L).
CRP levels at baseline were correlated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS). The median CRP in patients with
an ECOG PS of 0 was 6.9 mg/L and was 27.6 mg/L in
patients with an ECOG PS >0 (P < .0001). We therefore sought to determine whether CRP adds to established clinical prognostic factors. We performed a
multivariate analysis that included 13 potential baseline prognostic markers including serum PSA, serum
LDH, serum alkaline phosphatase, blood HGB concentration, ECOG PS, race, age, the presence or absence of bone metastases, the presence or absence of
measurable disease, prior prostatectomy, opioid analgesic use, and prior skeletal-related events, which
were examined in a Cox proportional hazards model
in addition to CRP. In the absence of CRP from this
model, baseline ECOG PS (0 vs 1 or 2) (HR of 1.94;

95% CI, 1.12–3.36 [P 5 .019]) and HGB (g/L) (HR of
0.98; 95% CI, 0.96–0.99 [P 5 .005]) were both found
to be significant predictors of OS. However, when
CRP was entered into the same multivariate model,
only elevated CRP remained a significant predictor
(HR of 1.41; 95% CI, 1.20–1.65 [P < .0001]) of shorter
OS. The area under the ROC for OS using ln CRP as
a risk factor was 66.6%.

Biomarkers and Response to Therapy
PSA decline, defined as a 50% reduction that was
confirmed 28 days later, was achieved in 65% of
this group of 160 patients. From the 16 biomarkers
analyzed in the baseline samples of these patients,
CRP remained as the only predictor of a PSA decline,
with statistical significance in the final model (odds
ratio [OR] of 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60–0.92 [P 5 .007])
(Table 3). This translates to a 26% reduction in odds
of a PSA decline for every 2.72-fold increase in baseline serum CRP. This effect can also be expressed as
a 19% decrease in the odds of PSA decline for each
doubling in baseline serum CRP. When patients were
analyzed by quartile of CRP (n 5 40 in each group),
80% of patients whose CRP was in the lowest quartile
had a PSA decline in response to therapy, whereas
only 53% of patients whose CRP was in the highest
quartile met criteria for PSA decline. Quartiles 2 and
3 were associated with PSA decline rates of 68% and
60%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
CRP, a readily measurable blood marker of inflammation, proved to be a strong predictor of OS and PSA
decline in this group of men with metastatic AIPC
who were initiating a docetaxel-containing chemotherapy regimen. Indeed, it proved more predictive
than conventional prognostic and predictive factors.
CRP has previously been described as being predictive of survival in several advanced malignancies
including melanoma21; non-Hodgkin lymphoma22;
and ovarian,23,24 colorectal,25 and pancreatic cancers,26,27 as well as in multiple myeloma.28 In a
recent study of 62 men with metastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy, elevated
CRP concentrations were found to be independently
predictive of shorter cancer-specific survival,
although the association fell short of statistical significance in this small sample (HR of 1.97; 95% CI,
0.99–3.92 [P 5 .052]).29 Herein we demonstrated that
in addition to predicting poor OS, elevated CRP
levels (>8 mg/L) were associated with a lower probability of PSA decline during docetaxel-based therapy
in men with AIPC. To our knowledge, this is the first
clinical evidence linking systemic inflammation with

chemotherapy in men with AIPC.
To our knowledge, the biologic basis for the correlation between elevations in this general marker of
systemic inflammation and disease risk and outcome
are not completely understood. The liberation of
multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1,
IL-6, and TNF-a from the tumor microenvironment
eventually results in the induction of CRP synthesis
from the liver and other tissues.30,31 As a prototypical
acute phase protein, CRP levels rise rapidly in
response to inflammation and may regulate the
innate immune response by activating complement,
engaging fragment crystallizable region (Fc) receptors
to activate phagocytosis, or in stimulating the pro-

duction of additional proinflammatory cytokines to
further enhance the inflammatory response.30,32
Others have previously shown that higher serum
IL-6 concentrations were predictive of shorter survival and lower probability of response to docetaxel
in patients with AIPC.33,34 In our analysis, IL-6 was
not found to be an independent predictive or prognostic factor, although baseline IL-6 levels were
found to be weakly correlated with baseline levels of
CRP (R2 5 0.029, P 5 .03, data not shown). The
plasma half-life of CRP is approximately 19 hours,35
whereas the half-life of IL-6 is <6 hours.36 It is possible that differences in sample handling limited our
ability to assess the more volatile cytokines without
affecting the more stable CRP. It is also possible that
CRP more reliably integrates the overall inflammatory state than the measurement of any individual
cytokine. Therefore, CRP may not only be a stronger
predictor of outcome, but a more practical measure
that could be implemented into practice, even in settings in which immediate sample handling and freezing may not be realistic.
The current study has several limitations. A sample size of 160 is modest for an analysis of prognostic
markers in this patient population. The study was an
exploratory and retrospective effort and the results
should be confirmed using an independent sample
set from patients with AIPC. We are pursuing confirmatory analyses using samples and clinical data
from prostate cancer studies performed within the
Southwest Oncology Group. Lastly, because of the
limited stability of cytokines, our analysis of soluble
proteins from frozen plasma samples may not
exclude the potential prognostic value of other circulating biomarkers.
If confirmed, CRP could prove to be a useful and
readily measurable prognostic marker that could aid
in clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and
clinical trial design and interpretation. Furthermore,
elevated CRP could provide us with vital insight into
the fundamental role of inflammation in the progression of advanced prostate cancer. A better understanding of this process could provide us with novel
therapeutic interventions for control of this disease
and its symptoms.
