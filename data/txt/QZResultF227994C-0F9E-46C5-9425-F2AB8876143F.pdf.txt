Abstract
5-Azacytidine (aza-C) and its derivatives are cytidine analogues used for leukemia chemotherapy. The primary effect of
aza-C is the prohibition of cytosine methylation, which results
in covalent methyltransferase-DNA (MTase-DNA) adducts at
cytosine methylation sites. These adducts have been suggested
to cause chromosomal rearrangements and contribute to
cytotoxicity, but the detailed mechanisms have not been
elucidated. We used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy to analyze plasmid pBR322
replication dynamics in Escherichia coli cells grown in the
presence of aza-C. Two-dimensional gel analysis revealed the
accumulation of specific bubble and Y molecules, dependent
on overproduction of the cytosine MTase EcoRII (M.EcoRII)
and treatment with aza-C. Furthermore, a point mutation that
eliminates a particular EcoRII methylation site resulted in
disappearance of the corresponding bubble and Y molecules.
These results imply that aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts
block DNA replication in vivo. RecA-dependent X structures
were also observed after aza-C treatment. These molecules
may be generated from blocked forks by recombinational
repair and/or replication fork regression. In addition, electron
microscopy analysis revealed both bubbles and rolling circles
(RC) after aza-C treatment. These results suggest that
replication can switch from theta to RC mode after a
replication fork is stalled by an MTase-DNA adduct. The
simplest model for the conversion of theta to RC mode is
that the blocked replication fork is cleaved by a branchspecific endonuclease. Such replication-dependent DNA
breaks may represent an important pathway that contributes
to genome rearrangement and/or cytotoxicity. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Numerous chemicals as well as radiation can lead to covalent
protein-DNA adducts, but little is known about the consequences
of these adducts in vivo. One important chemotherapeutic agent
that leads to protein-DNA adducts is 5-azacytidine (aza-C), which
was first synthesized in 1964 (1). Since then, aza-C and its
derivatives have been approved for myelodysplastic syndrome, and
have proven beneficial for patients with acute and chronic
myelogenous leukemia (2–4).

Aza-C is a cytidine analogue in which carbon-5 (C5) of the
pyrimidine ring is replaced with nitrogen. Normally, a DNA
cytosine-C5 methyltransferase (MTase) acts on a cytosine residue
in its recognition sequence by covalently binding to C6, and then
transferring the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to C5;
the covalent protein-DNA linkage is then reversed and the enzyme
dissociates from the DNA (5). However, aza-C substitution at the
target cytosine interferes with the reaction cycle and results in
long-lived or irreversible MTase-DNA adducts (6–8). Evidence for
adduct formation in vivo has been presented (9, 10).
A major consequence of aza-C treatment is loss of cytosine
MTase activity (11–13). Hypomethylation caused by aza-C can lead
to alteration of gene expression, replication timing, and decondensation of chromatin (14–18). Significantly, tumor-suppressor genes
can be reactivated by aza-C treatment, and synergistic effects have
been seen with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (19). In mammalian
cells, aza-C treatment also results in defective tRNAs and rRNAs,
and inhibits protein synthesis (20). These RNA effects are avoided
with the deoxy version, 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (aza-dC; ref. 20).
The consequences of covalent MTase-DNA adduct formation can
also be important. Embryonic stem cells and transgenic mice with
reduced levels of cytosine MTase were more resistant to aza-dC
than the wild-type, suggesting that protein-DNA adduct formation
mediates aza-dC cytotoxicity (21). In addition, aza-C sensitivity of
some tumor cell lines correlates positively with MTase levels (22).
Furthermore, Jackson-Grusby et al. (23) detected a high frequency
of C:G to G:C transversion mutations at CpG islands in promotor
regions after aza-dC treatment, suggesting that MTase-DNA
adducts might be involved in mutagenesis. Aza-dC treatment also
causes induction of p53 DNA damage response, proposed to be
dependent on formation of the MTase-DNA adducts (24). Finally,
aza-C–dependent MTase-DNA adducts have been implicated in
chromosomal rearrangements, chromosomal breakages, and bone
marrow toxicity (20).
Studies in bacterial cells have contributed to our understanding
of aza-C cytotoxicity. E. coli cells deficient in the chromosomally
encoded DNA cytosine MTase (Dcm) are less sensitive to aza-C
than wild-type (25), whereas overproduction of Dcm or M.EcoRII
increases aza-C sensitivity (26, 27). In addition, mutations in the
recombination genes recA and recBC cause hypersensitivity to azaC (25–27). Genetic studies of recA and lexA (SOS repressor)
mutants argue that the recombination function of RecA is very
important for survival after aza-C treatment, and that induction of
the SOS response is protective (25, 27). These results imply that
aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts play a significant role in
cytotoxicity, and that some pathway of RecA-dependent recombinational repair is competent to repair these protein-DNA adducts
or downstream DNA damage.
Covalent protein-DNA adducts or tightly bound proteins
represent a major challenge to the DNA replication machinery.
DNA replication forks can be blocked in vivo by replication

termination complexes such as Tus-Ter (28) or by drug-stabilized
topoisomerase-DNA covalent complexes (29, 30). Here, we report
that aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts block plasmid pBR322
DNA replication in vivo. We also observed RecA-dependent X
structures after replication blockage, implying that blocked forks
are processed by RecA. In addition, electron microscopy revealed
both theta and rolling circle (RC) replicating plasmids. The
formation of X structures and RCs suggest that the stalled
replication forks may be prone to breakage. If so, these ‘‘collateral’’
DNA breaks may represent a pathway that contributes to the
cytotoxicity and/or genome instability induced by aza-C.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Aza-C was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; restriction enzymes
were from New England Biolabs; Nytran membranes were from Schleicher
& Schuell; Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit was from Roche Applied
Science; and radiolabeled nucleotides were from Perkin-Elmer Life Science.
Oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized by
Sigma-Aldrich and the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was from
Stratagene. Luria broth contained Bacto tryptone (10 g/L), yeast extract
(5 g/L), and sodium chloride (10 g/L).
Plasmids. The M.EcoRII overexpression plasmid with a tetracycline
resistance gene, pR215, was kindly provided by Ashok Bhagwat (Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI; ref. 31). Monomeric
(pR215, pBR322, and pBR322-C1060A) or dimeric (pBR322 dimer) plasmids
were gel purified and used for transformation (see below). pBR322-C1060A
plasmid, which was generated using the Stratagene QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit, contains a C to A mutation at location 1060; this destroys one of
M.EcoRII recognition sites but does not alter translation of the tetracycline
resistance gene.
E. coli strains. E. coli strains were AB1157 (his-4 argE3 leuB6 proA2 thr-1
thi-1 rpsL31 galK2 lacY1 ara-14 xyl-5 mtl-1 kdgK51 supE44 tsx-33 rec+) and
AB1157 recA. These two strains were transformed with the M.EcoRII
overexpression plasmid, pR215. The desired plasmid(s) were introduced
into the AB1157 strains by transformation, and colonies with mostly
monomeric plasmid ( for pR215, pBR322, and pBR322-C1060A) or mostly
dimeric plasmid ( for pBR322 dimer) were selected based on miniprep
results and frozen in aliquots at 80jC. These aliquots were diluted directly

www.aacrjournals.org

into culture medium to ensure the monomeric or dimeric plasmid state for
each experiment.
DNA preparation for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. E. coli
strains with the desired plasmid(s) were grown in Luria broth with
appropriate antibiotics to maintain selection for the plasmid(s). Aza-C was
added to 0.25 mg/mL when the cultures reached an A 560 of 0.3. After
3-h incubation with or without aza-C, 2-mL samples were collected by
centrifugation and frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cell pellets were
resuspended in 500 AL of Triton lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.8),
10 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1.8 mg/mL lysozyme] and
incubated at 65jC for 20 min. Proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL) and SDS (0.2%)
were added to the samples, which were then incubated at 55jC for 1 h.
DNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)
followed by dialysis with TE [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mmol/L EDTA]
at 4jC overnight.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization.
The first dimension (0.4% agarose) was run in 0.5 Tris-borate EDTA (TBE)
buffer at 1 V/cm for 29 h. The desired slices were cut, rotated 90j
counterclockwise, and cast within the top of the second-dimension gel
(1% agarose with ethidium bromide at 0.3 Ag/mL). The second-dimension
gel was run at 4.5 V/cm for 16.5 h at 4jC with recirculated 0.5 TBE
containing ethidium bromide at 0.3 Ag/mL. The gels were analyzed by
Southern hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe that was made using the
Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit and a 729-bp ampicillin resistance gene
fragment from pBR322 (which does not hybridize with plasmid pR215).
Southern blots were visualized by PhosphorImager.
DNA preparation for electron microscopy. DNA samples for electron
microscopy analysis were prepared using a modification of the Hirt
precipitation method (32, 33). Briefly, cell pellets from 6 mL of culture were
resuspended in 0.5 mL SDS lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mmol/L
EDTA, and 0.6% SDS] and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. NaCl
was added to a final concentration of 1.4 mol/L and the lysate was mixed
gently and then incubated at 4jC overnight. The lysate was centrifuged at
13,000 g at 4jC for 40 min to remove cell debris and chromosomal material.
The supernatant was collected and treated with RNase A (0.05 mg/mL) at
37jC for 1 h, followed by proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL) at 55jC for 1 h. The DNAs
were further purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)
extraction and dialyzed against TE at 4jC overnight.
Electron microscopy. Sample preparation for electron microscopy used
the denatured cytochrome C method (Kleinschmidt method) in the droplet

form. DNA samples were mixed with ammonium acetate (0.25 mol/L) and
cytochrome c (Sigma) at 7 Ag/mL and placed on a sheet of parafilm for 90 s
to 5 min. The surface film was picked up with a parlodion-covered electron
microscopy grid and dehydrated in 70% and 90% ethanol, 30 s each, and air
dried. The grids were shadowcast with rotation (8j) with Pt/Pd (80%:20%)
at 1  10 6 Torr and examined in Tecnai 12 TEM instrument at 40 kV.
Images were collected with a 4K  4K Gatan CCD camera.

Results
Replication fork blockage in vivo after aza-C treatment. To
investigate the potential blockage of DNA replication by azaC–induced MTase-DNA adducts in vivo, we used two-dimensional
agarose gel electrophoresis. The first dimension separates DNA
based on size with little contribution from shape, whereas the
second dimension separates DNA by both size and shape.
Replication intermediates of plasmid pBR322 were visualized by
Southern hybridization with a specific probe.
Figure 1 shows the expected replication intermediates and
predicted two-dimensional gel patterns of pBR322 linearized by
HindIII (Fig. 1A) or AlwNI (Fig. 1B; refs. 34, 35). Plasmid pBR322
replicates unidirectionally from position 2535 bp, generating
predominantly bubble (B) molecules and double Y molecules
(DY) in these restriction digests. We first analyzed DNA isolated
from a pBR322-containing strain that has only the endogenous
(chromosomally encoded) Dcm. However, we did not detect any
accumulation of stalled forks after growth in the presence of aza-C
(Fig. 2B and G). The activity of endogenous Dcm protein is weak
(26); thus, we reasoned that MTase-DNA adducts formed with Dcm
might be insufficient for detecting stalled forks. We therefore
generated a strain containing both pBR322 and plasmid pR215,
which overexpresses M.EcoRII; M.EcoRII recognizes the same
sequence as Dcm (CCWGG; second C is methylated). With
overexpression of M.EcoRII, we readily detected three strong spots
on the bubble arc (Fig. 2D and I, closed arrows). These
accumulations on the bubble arc were dependent on the presence
of pR215 and aza-C treatment (compare the aza-C–treated samples

in Fig. 2D and I with the untreated samples in Fig. 2C and H). If
aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts block DNA replication, then
we would expect four classes of bubble molecules (branches near
131, 1,060, 1,443, and 2,501 bp) and two classes of double-Y
molecules (branches near 2,622 and 2,635 bp). However, the
bubbles near the 2,501 bp site would be very small, and these
molecules should therefore migrate very near the linear monomer,
which likely prevents their detection. In addition, the two classes of
double-Y molecules would be obscured by a strong accumulation of
late replicating intermediates in this region of the gel even in the
absence of aza-C (compare the double-Y region in Fig. 2C and D).
To determine whether the fork blockage evident on the bubble
arc is due to aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts, we mutated
CCATT to CAATT at the 1,060 bp M.EcoRII recognition site. The
mutated plasmid (pBR322-C1060A) was confirmed by restriction
enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S1;
data not shown). The bubble spot consistent with the 1,060 bp site
disappeared in both the HindIII and AlwNI digests of the mutated
plasmid (Fig. 2E and J, closed arrows). Therefore, we conclude that
aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts block DNA replication in vivo.
RecA-dependent formation of X structures. We were surprised to find an accumulation of X structures in the twodimensional gels, dependent on both M.EcoRII overexpression and
aza-C treatment (Fig. 2D and I). We next introduced pR215 and
pBR322 into a recA derivative of AB1157 and analyzed the DNA
from aza-C–treated cells. The X structures disappeared from the
recA strain (Fig. 3A and B, arrow), whereas bubble accumulations
were still present. Accumulation of the X structures is therefore
RecA dependent.
Wild-type cells transformed with monomeric plasmid still
contain a small percentage of dimer plasmids due to RecAdependent recombination. Thus, the absence of X structures in
Fig. 3B could be an indirect consequence of RecA deficiency.
Therefore, we created wild-type and recA strains containing
pR215 monomer and pBR322 dimer plasmids. The X structures
were again absent from the recA strain (compare Fig. 3C with D,

(A–D, F–I ) or mutated pBR322-C1060A (E and J )
and digested with either Hin dIII (A–E) or Alw NI

plasmid pR215) and the treatment with aza-C are
indicated. The digested DNA was subjected to

DNA Replication Blockage Induced by 5-Azacytidine

mechanism for creating Y molecules also involves RC replication,
namely blockage of theta replication within the tail of the RCs
(Fig. 4C). Blockage of theta replication within the tail would result
in a similar set of theta and Y molecules as described above for the
first model, but the Y molecules could predominate.
To distinguish between these mechanisms and further analyze
aza-C–induced replication blockage, we set out to use electron
microscopy to visualize the intermediates. DNA was prepared from
aza-C–treated cells that contained dimeric pBR322 and monomeric
pR215 plasmid. We used a modification of the Hirt isolation
method (32, 33) to separate nonreplicating plasmids and
replicating plasmid intermediates from the chromosomal DNA.
This procedure precipitates chromosomal DNA, whereas plasmid
DNAs remain in the supernatant. We analyzed the efficiency of the
Hirt procedure by subjecting the two DNA fractions to both onedimensional and two-dimensional gels. When analyzed by onedimensional gel with ethidium bromide staining, roughly 90% to
95% of the chromosomal DNA was precipitated into the pellet,
whereas 90% of the plasmid circles remained in the supernatant.
Meanwhile, two-dimensional gel analysis of HindIII-digested DNA
with Southern blotting showed that f65% of the replication

arrow). Therefore, accumulation of the X structures is directly
dependent on RecA, presumably reflecting either RecA-dependent
recombination or RecA-dependent fork regression (see Discussion).
Formation of Y molecules is due to RC replication. Another
unexpected pattern from the two-dimensional gels was the
accumulation of spots on the Y arc. The Y-spot accumulations
were dependent on M.EcoRII overexpression and aza-C treatment
(Fig. 2D and I), and much more dramatic with plasmid dimers than
monomers (compare spots on the Y arc in Fig. 3C and A). In
addition, one of the Y spots disappeared from the mutated pBR322C1060A plasmid (compare Fig. 2D with E, open arrows), implying
that the Y spots depended on aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts.
At least three possible mechanisms can create Y molecules. First,
theta replication within a dimer pBR322 creates bubbles if
replication is blocked before the first restriction digestion site
but Y molecules if replication is blocked after that site (Fig. 4A).
According to this interpretation, we would expect a roughly equal
intensity for the spots on the Y and bubble arcs from the cells
carrying the dimer plasmid. However, we detected much more
intense spots on the Y arc. The second possible mechanism is
replication blockage within a RC replication structure (Fig. 4B). RC
plasmid replication usually does not occur in E. coli because the
exonuclease function of RecBCD destroys the RC tail (36, 37).
However, the exonuclease activity of RecBCD may be inhibited in
aza-C–treated cells. Induction of chromosomal DNA damage, for
example, by UV, seems to saturate the exonuclease activity (38).
Alternatively, RecBCD translocation might be inhibited by aza-C–
induced MTase-DNA adducts on the RC tail. The third possible

resembling either trimeric pBR322 or dimeric pR215. Furthermore,
we scored five replicating theta forms (Fig. 5B) and four RCs
(Fig. 5D) for pR215 monomer plasmid, which reinforces the
conclusion that RC replication occurs in the presence of aza-C. We
also found a relatively large number of plasmids with small tails
(Table 1), which could result from either broken thetas or RCs with
short or broken tails. We observed some molecules with apparent
X structure in the electron microscopy. However, these are not
definitive because they could be either bona fide X structures or
two DNA molecules that happen to overlap on the grid. Overall, the
electron microscopy data strongly support the hypothesis that azaC induces a switch from theta to RC in a subset of molecules.
As an additional test for the existence of RC intermediates, we
analyzed the Hirt pellet and supernatant fractions by twodimensional gel analysis without restriction enzyme digestion. RC
intermediates produced from a well-characterized in vitro replication system have been shown to migrate in a characteristic ‘‘ds
eyebrow’’ arc that emanates from the open circle spot (39). In both
the supernatant and pellet, DNA from the aza-C–treated cells (but
not the untreated cells) displayed this ds eyebrow arc, providing
additional evidence that aza-C induces plasmid RC replication
(Supplementary Fig. S2C and F). The aza-C–dependent ds eyebrow
emanated from the dimer open circle spot, not from the monomer,
indicating that the RC molecules have a dimeric rather than
monomeric template circle (consistent with the electron microscopy results above).

Discussion

plasmid from aza-C–treated cells. Electron microscopy analysis revealed
replication bubbles and RCs from both pBR322 dimer and pR215 plasmids. The
replication bubbles (A and B) and RCs (C and D) shown had approximately the
contour lengths expected for pBR322 dimer (A and C ; 8.7 kb expected) and
pR215 (B and D ; 6.2 kb expected). Arrows, the branch junctions of the bubble
and RC molecules. The plasmid and tail lengths were measured using the Gatan
DigitalMicrograph program. The replicated segments of the bubbles were
measured to be 5.0 and 4.8 kb for pBR322 dimer (A) and 3.4 and 3.2 kb for
pR215 (B ). The unreplicated regions were measured to be 2.9 kb for pBR322
dimer (A ) and 2.6 kb for pR215 (B); in each case, the unreplicated segment is
the one in the middle. The circle within the pBR322 dimer RC (C ) was measured
to be 8.4 kb and the tail was 18.9 kb, whereas the pR215 RC (D) circle was
measured to be 5.7 kb and the tail was 18.4 kb. Identical magnifications were
used in (A) and (B) and in (C ) and (D ); lower magnification was used in (C ) and
(D) so that the entire RC could be visualized.

The major conclusion of this work is that aza-C–induced MTaseDNA adducts block DNA replication in vivo. We did not detect
blockage induced by the endogenous Dcm protein, presumably due
to low endogenous Dcm activity (26). However, fork blockage was
evident after aza-C treatment of cells carrying the M.EcoRII
overexpression plasmid pR215. Previous studies provided evidence
for the formation of covalent aza-C–induced MTase-DNA adducts
in vivo (9, 10), and our results argue that a major effect of these
adducts is the blockage of DNA replication.
In addition to fork blockage within theta intermediates (Fig. 2),
we detected strong accumulation of spots on the Y arc, particularly
when cells carried dimeric pBR322 plasmid (Fig. 3). These

intermediates were pelleted, whereas f35% remained in the
supernatant (Supplementary Fig. S2D and A, respectively).
Although we recovered less than half the replication intermediates in the supernatant, the elimination of chromosomal DNA was
critical for clear interpretations of the electron microscopy images.
Therefore, we analyzed the DNA from the supernatant by electron
microscopy. For each replication intermediate visualized, we
measured the lengths of the DNA segments and compared the
circle length to the measured length of nonreplicating control
pR215 and pBR322 dimer plasmids (see Fig. 5 legend for
measurements of molecules in that figure).
We observed many nonreplicating circular pBR322 dimers and
several theta structures (Fig. 5A; Table 1). In addition, we found
eight unambiguous RCs (Fig. 5C) with a tail length ranging from 1.4
to 2.5 times larger than the attached circle size. Out of these eight
RCs, four had a circle consistent with the size of pBR322 dimer,
whereas four others had a larger plasmid circle than expected,

NOTE: The length of the circular component of all replication forms in

either pR215 (roughly 6.2 kb) or pBR322 dimer (roughly 8.7 kb). Several
plasmids larger than pBR322 dimer were also observed and added to
the pBR322 dimer category. The sizes of these larger plasmids were
closest to dimer pR215 or trimer pBR322. Simple circle molecules
represented in the last column were not measured, but categorized as
either ‘‘pR215’’ or ‘‘pBR322 dimer and larger plasmids’’ based on visual
inspection of the circle size.

accumulations were also dependent on aza-C–induced MTase-DNA
adducts (Fig. 2E), and our results argue that these Y molecules are
created by fork blockage in a RC. Using electron microscopy
analysis, we found both replicating thetas and sigma-shaped
plasmids with tails. Sigma-shaped plasmids would correspond to
the Y molecules in the two-dimensional gels after restriction digestion. A number of the sigma molecules in the electron microscopy
had tails longer than the length of the attached plasmid circle,
demonstrating that RC replication had occurred (Fig. 5; Table 1). We
strongly suspect that RCs with even longer tails were preferentially
lost in the Hirt precipitation, which eliminates long linear DNA. The
simplest explanation for the formation of RCs in the aza-C–treated
cells involves breakage of the stalled forks (see below).
We also observed a strong accumulation of RecA-dependent X
structures after aza-C treatment of cells with pR215. The blocked
forks on the theta and Y arcs appeared as early as 30 min, but X
structures only appeared after 60 min of aza-C treatment (data not
shown). This result argues that the X structures are somehow
generated from molecules with blocked forks. One model is that
these X structures are Holliday junctions generated by a
recombination reaction. Replication forks stalled by aza-C–induced
MTase-DNA adducts may sometimes be processed into strand
breaks that can then be used as a substrate for RecA-dependent
recombination. Because recombination mutants including recA are
hypersensitive to aza-C (26, 27), the Holliday junctions we observe
may reflect a key repair pathway for survival after aza-C treatment.
Another model for X structure formation is RecA-dependent
replication fork regression of a stalled RC. Robu et al. (40) showed
that RecA protein can catalyze fork regression in vitro, and
Courcelle et al. (41) presented evidence consistent with RecAstabilized fork regression in vivo after UV-induced damage. Because
of the repeating nature of a RC tail, regression of a RC intermediate
can generate an X structure that is exactly twice the plasmid length
after restriction digestion; that is, exactly equivalent in structure
to a plasmid dimer with a Holliday junction. In summary, the
generation of Holliday junctions after aza-C treatment implies that
DNA ends are created either by fork breakage or by fork regression.
We propose that RCs are sometimes generated after a
unidirectional fork in a theta molecule encounters an aza-C–
induced MTase-DNA adduct. Replication fork blockage can allow a
branch-specific endonuclease to cleave one arm of a fork (30, 42),
and then two general models for RC replication are possible. In one
model, RC replication ensues after gap repair/ligation at the broken
fork and replication restart at the unbroken fork (Supplementary
Fig. S3). The second model involves RecA-dependent recombination triggered by the broken fork. A simple version of this model
involves intermolecular recombination of the broken end with a

second circle, resulting in a ‘‘double-circle RC’’ with circular
plasmids at both ends (Supplementary Fig. S4). In this model, the
RC replication itself is activated upon loading of a replisome onto
the displacement loop created in the strand invasion reaction.
None of the RC molecules that we observed in the electron
microscopy had circles at both ends as predicted by this simple
recombination model. However, such double-circle RCs could have
enormously long intervening linear DNA after RC replication,
making them difficult to isolate intact. Further experiments are
clearly needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism that triggers
RC replication after aza-C treatment.
Several prior studies argued that aza-C–induced MTase-DNA
adducts are important in cytotoxicity (see Introduction). Prior
studies also suggested that aza-C treatment leads to DNA breaks,
likely dependent on formation of the MTase-DNA adducts. Karon
and Benedict (43) detected chromatin breaks after treatment of
mammalian cells with aza-C, although the mechanism was
unexplored. Furthermore, the bacterial SOS response is induced
by aza-C (25, 27), and recombination mutants (recA and recBC) are
hypersensitive to the analogue (25–27).
As described above, our observation of RC intermediates and
Holliday junctions after aza-C treatment strongly suggests that
DNA breaks are formed from blocked replication forks. We refer to
this kind of DNA breakage as ‘‘collateral damage,’’ because it is an
indirect consequence of the primary mechanism of inhibition. We
propose that this collateral damage could be a major factor in the
cytotoxicity of aza-C treatment and that it could be involved in
generation of both DNA damage responses and chromosomal
rearrangements induced by aza-C.
Drug-stabilized topoisomerase-DNA complexes are somewhat
analogous to aza-C–induced covalent MTase-DNA adducts. A
variety of antitumor drugs and antibacterial quinolones have been
shown to stabilize covalent topoisomerase-DNA complexes involving either type I or type II topoisomerases, including bacterial DNA
gyrase (44, 45). In several cases, these complexes have been shown to
block replication forks, and these blocked forks can be cleaved by
endonucleases (29, 30, 42, 46). Therefore, fork blockage and collateral
DNA damage may be a common mechanism for chemotherapy.
