Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes via homozygous deletion is a prototypic event in the
cancer genome, yet such deletions often encompass neighboring genes. We hypothesized that
homozygous deletions in such passenger genes can expose cancer-specific therapeutic
vulnerabilities in the case where the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a functionally
redundant family of genes exercising an essential function. The glycolytic gene Enolase 1 (ENO1)
in the 1p36 locus is deleted in Glioblastoma (GBM), which is tolerated by expression of ENO2.
We demonstrate that shRNA-mediated extinction of ENO2 selectively inhibits growth, survival,
and tumorigenic potential of ENO1-deleted GBM cells and that the enolase inhibitor
phosphonoacetohydroxamate (PhAH) is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells relative to

applicable to other passenger deleted genes encoding functionally-redundant essential activities
and provide an effective treatment strategy for cancers harboring such genomic events.

Large scale analysis of the cancer genome has provided an unprecedentedly detailed picture
of the genetic anatomy of cancer1 which has been, and continues to serve as a blueprint for
the development of molecular targeted therapies. Targeted therapies directed against
amplified or mutant-activated key driver oncoproteins have provided encouraging clinical
progress2, whereas exploiting loss-of-function mutations or gene deletions has received
considerably less attention and has thus far been less successful. Previous therapeutic work
in the area of loss-of-function mutations and deletions has focused specifically on tumor
suppressor genes via strategies that include synthetic lethal approaches. One striking
example of a synthetic lethal interaction is the response of BRCA1-mutant cancers to PARP
inhibitors, although this interaction appears to be dependent on genetic context3,4, and can
be bypassed in late stage tumors3,4,5. Most other synthetic lethal interactors of inactivated
tumor suppressors appear to be less robust in eliciting cancer cell death5, perhaps because
such genes typically do not perform fundamental housekeeping functions.

Cancer genomes are characterized by numerous copy number amplifications and deletions,
which target driver oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively. Often, these
genomic alterations are large regional events, affecting many other genes in addition to the
intended target(s). The fact that such broad genomic alterations are not negatively selected
against in cancer cells implies that, on their own, the copy number alterations of these
neighboring passengers must not carry severely detrimental biological consequences. That
said, it is conceivable that these passenger genomic events can create unintended (collateral)
vulnerabilities unique to those cells; such as when a passenger being co-deleted is a member
of a redundant multi-gene family serving an essential housekeeping function. A large body
of genetic interaction studies in invertebrates as well as mice indicates that many essential
cellular housekeeping functions are carried out by multiple homologous genes that encode
overlapping functions; this redundancy enables cell viability upon loss of one homologue
but causes lethality upon loss of multiple homologues6–10 (Supplementary Fig. 1). In this
conceptual framework, we hypothesized that the homozygous deletion of redundant
essential housekeeping genes could create cancer-specific vulnerabilities (Supplementary
Fig. 1a) whereby pharmacological inactivation of the second, non-deleted homologue would
result in complete loss of activity in tumor cells carrying the deletion, without compromising
the health of normal cells, in which both genes are intact and expressed (Supplementary Fig.
1b).

ENO1 is an essential redundant housekeeping gene homozygoulsy deleted
in glioblastoma
By examining the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM data set for homozygous deletions
targeting genes involved in essential cell activities1, we identified various such candidates,
including the ENO1 gene, which resides at the 1p36 tumor suppressor locus (See Table 1 for
a summary and Supplementary Table 1 for more detailed methodological support). Enolase,

which is encoded by three homologous genes, is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the
second to last step of glycolysis, converting 2-phosphoglyceric acid into
phosphoenolpyruvate11. In mammals, enolase activity is encoded by three genes: ENO1,
which is ubiquitously expressed12,13; ENO2, which is expressed exclusively in neural
tissues12,14; and ENO3, which is expressed in muscle tissues15 (Supplementary Table 2).
ENO1 is the major enolase isoform in GBM, accounting for 75–90% of cellular enolase
activity12. Given the critical importance of glycolysis for energy generation and anabolic
processes in normal and especially tumor cells16, GBM tumors homozygous null for ENO1
would be predicted to be highly sensitive to inhibition of enolase 2, whereas normal neural
tissues should not be affected because of the functional redundancy of enolase 1 (Fig. 1a,b).
Correspondingly, ENO2 knockout mice are viable and fertile, suggesting that
pharmacological inhibition of enolase 2 is likely to be well tolerated at the organism level
(Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which possesses several
enolase homologues, shows weak phenotypes with single mutants and incurs cell lethality
only when all homologues are deleted8–10; whereas, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila
possess only one gene encoding enolase activity, and its deletion is lethal17,18.

The 1p36 locus, which contains several candidate tumor suppressor genes, including CHD5
and CAMTA119,20, sustains frequent deletion in GBM (Fig. 2a). The 1p36 locus is
homozygously deleted in 1–5% of GBMs1,21,22 (as well as oligodendrogliomas23 and largecell neuroendocrine lung tumors24) and ENO1 is often included in the deletion. By
examining the TCGA copy number aberrations (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] and
array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH] data)1 and expression profiles, we
identified 5/359 GBM samples with homozygous deletion of ENO1 and associated nearcomplete absence of its expression (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). We identified two
GBM cell lines, D423-MG22 and Gli5625, with homozygous deletions at the 1p36 locus
spanning ENO1. A third GBM cell line, D502-MG22, also incurs homozygous deletion of
many genes in this locus yet leaves ENO1 intact and thus serves as an excellent control (Fig.
2c). Western blot analysis confirmed the loss of enolase 1 and the retention of enolase 2
protein in D423-MG and Gli56, whereas both proteins were present in D502-MG and in all
other glioma and normal glial cell lines tested (Fig. 2d).

ENO2 knockdown inhibits growth of ENO1-deleted cells and not wild type
cells

Author Manuscript

We used the D502-MG (ENO1 wild-type [WT]) and D423-MG (ENO1-null) cell lines to
assess the impact of shRNA-mediated knockdown of ENO2 in an ENO1 WT or null context.
Two independent ENO2 shRNAs (pLKO.1 vector) resulted in robust protein reduction and
led to a profound inhibition of cell growth only in the context of ENO1 genomic deletion
(Supplementary Fig. 3). We obtained the same result using an additional, independent ENO2
shRNA (pGIPZ vector) (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, shRNA ablation of ENO2
in ENO1-null cells also resulted in decreased soft agar colony formation and blocked the in
vivo tumorigenic potential of intracranially injected cells (Figure 2e and Supplementary Fig.
4c). Finally, the selective toxicity of ENO2 ablation to ENO1-null cells was demonstrated in
an isogenic context using the doxycycline-inducible TRIPZ vector. When we used this

doxycycline-inducible system in ENO1 WT cell lines (U87, A1207, LN319), two
independent shRNAs reduced enolase 2 protein levels by >70% (Fig. 3a) with no impact on
enolase 1 levels (data not shown). This ablation of ENO2 resulted in a profound inhibition of
cell proliferation only in the ENO1-null D423-MG cell line (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, enforced
expression of hairpin-resistant ENO2 cDNA fully reversed the deleterious effects of the
shENO2 hairpin (Supplementary Fig. 5), showing that the inhibitory effect of the hairpin
was indeed specific to diminished ENO2 expression and was not an off-target effect.
Finally, when ENO1 was ectopically re-expressed in D423-MG (ENO1 null) cell lines at
levels similar to those observed in ENO1-WT GBM lines, the deleterious effect of shRNA
ablation of ENO2 was completely abrogated (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Next, we assessed the impact of pharmacological inhibition of enolase activity in ENO1 WT
and null cells. Previous studies have focused on the pharmacological inhibition of enolase,
in particular for antiparasitic purposes26,27 and many compounds have been characterized,
most of which act as reaction-intermediate analogues (Supplementary Table 3). The most
potent enolase inhibitor is PhAH27, which is thought to act as a transition-state analogue
with an inhibitory constant of 15 pM on yeast enolase. Although PhAH has not been tested
on human enolases, previous work demonstrated inhibitory effects on enolases from
distantly related organisms27,28, suggesting its potential use over a large phylogenetic
distance. We find that PhAH was indeed capable of potent inhibition of enolase in vitro in
native lysates of human GBM cell lines, with an IC50 of around 20 nM (Fig. 4b, data not
shown). We used PhAH in concentrations ranging from 0.625 µM to 50 µM and observed
marked toxicity in ENO1-null cells (Fig. 4a,c and Supplementary Fig. 7) and minimal
impact on the ENO1-WT controls, which show at least 10-times greater enolase activity
relative to the ENO1-null cells (because ENO1 accounts for 90% of total cellular enolase
activity12, Fig. 4b). Although the IC50 of PhAH is similar for ENO1 and ENO2 in vitro
(data not shown) the greater toxicity of the inhibitor to ENO1 null cells (Gli56, D423-MG)
derives from the fact that in these cells enolase activity is already 90% lower as compared to
ENO1-WT cell lines and consequently, a much lower dose is required to decrease total
enolase activity below toxicity threshold. Further data indicate a direct relationship between
the levels of enolase activity and the sensitivity to PhAH across different cell lines and in the
same cell line with different levels of enforced enolase expression. First, U343 and D502MG cells, which have intermediate levels of enolase activity (and enolase 1 protein
expression, Fig. 2d) compared with the other cell lines, have intermediate levels of
sensitivity to PhAH (Fig. 4), which in the case of U343 can be rescued by ectopic
overexpression of ENO1 or ENO2 (data not shown). A systematic titration of PhAH in
D423-MG cell lines with varying levels of enforced ENO1 or ENO2 expression, shows a
direct relationship between the level of enolase expression/activity and the ensuing
resistance to PhAH (Supplementary Fig. 7). PhAH toxicity was also abrogated in Gli56
ENO1-null cells by ectopic expression of physiological levels of ENO1 or overexpression of
ENO2 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Regarding the mechanism of toxicity, cell cycle and
apoptosis analysis demonstrated that PhAH treatment for 48 h induced a marked decrease of

S-phase followed by a marked increase of apoptosis in D423-MG but not in ENO1 WT
U373 cells (Supplementary Table 4). This effect was completely rescued by ENO2
overexpression (data not shown). The fact that this growth inhibition and subsequent
apoptosis is due to energy crisis is substantiated by a strong induction of phosphorylated
AMPK (Thr172)29, which was observed in D423-MG but not ENO1 WT cell lines (data not
shown). It is tempting to speculate that this energy stress response exerts a protective effect
and thus concomitant addition of an AMPK inhibitor with PhAH could result in further
toxicity. Finally, it is worth noting that ENO1-null cells do not show any greater sensitivity
to other molecular targeted therapies, such as a combination of receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors30 (lapatinib, sorafenib, and PHA665752) (Supplementary Fig. 8) and rapamycin
(data not shown) compared to ENO1 WT cells. These data indicate that D423-MG cells are
not broadly susceptible to other anticancer agents and that PhAH selectively targets ENO1null GBM cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this study, we sought to determine the impact of collateral deletion of genes in tumor
suppressor loci that belong to redundant gene families playing cell essential roles and to
assess whether extinction of remaining gene family members would create cancer-specific
vulnerabilities. We provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that enolase 2 inhibition
is lethal in cells with 1p36 homozygous deletion with collateral loss of ENO1, whereas
ENO1-intact cells can rely on enolase 1 to undergo glycolysis and support survival. These
findings are in agreement with genetic data from invertebrates8–10. Given that several
homozygously deleted housekeeping genes can occur in the same deletion on 1p36 (e.g.,
H6PD, Supplementary Table 1), it may be possible to further increase the effectiveness and
cancer-cell-specific killing by combining the inhibition of ENO2 with that of another
homologue of a simultaneously deleted housekeeping gene.

Attempts to therapeutically exploit general metabolic differences between normal and
cancer cells, such as glucose addiction (the Warburg effect) and glutamine or serine
addiction16,31,32, remain areas of active preclinical investigation and clinical development.
The approach described here is distinguished from these attempts in that it does not rely on
any general aspect of cancer cell metabolism, but rather rests on genetically determined
metabolic differences between normal and cancerous tissue to generate cancer-cell-specific
vulnerabilities. Indeed, we propose that collateral vulnerability may be extended to other
passenger homozygously deleted housekeeping genes in loci sustaining frequent deletion,
such as 9p21 (CDKN2A) and 10q23 (PTEN), which contain members of functionally
redundant housekeeping gene families (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary
Fig. 9). The strongest, pharmacologically targetable candidates in this list are the
homologues of the dual-function energy metabolism/iron regulator aconitase 1 (ACO1;
9p21) and the coenzyme A biosynthetic enzyme, pantothenate kinase 1 (PANK1; 10q23).
Importantly, many of the compounds targeting the homologues of these passenger genes
represent novel molecular entities with respect to cancer treatment.
By one estimate, 11% of all protein coding genes in the human genome are deleted in human
cancers33. Thus, given the large number of homozygous deletions across many different

cancer types spanning many hundreds of genes33–36, the paradigm described here for GBM
should be applicable to the development of personalized treatments for many additional
cancer types.

shRNA knockdown of ENO2 expression

Author Manuscript

We screened 22 hairpins targeting ENO2 and found 4 independent ones that reduced protein
levels by <50%. Two of these hairpins were in the pLKO.1 vector (shENO2-1 and
shENO2-2), and the remaining two were in the Expression Arrest GIPZ (shENO2-3) and
TRIPZ (shENO2-4) shRNAmir vectors (Open Biosystems). The ENO2 shRNA sequences
are as follows:
shENO2-1: 5’-CAAGGGAGTCATCAAGGACAA-3’; NM_001975
shENO2-2: 5’-CGCCTGGCTAATAAGGCTTTA-3’; NM_001975
shENO2-3: 5’-CGGCCTTCAACGTGATCAA-3’; NM_001975
shENO2-4: 5-’GGGACTGAGAACAAATCCA-3’. NM_001975

The hairpin in the GIPZ vector was cloned into the TRIPZ vector using a protocol provided
by the manufacturer. The TRIPZ vector is a doxycycline-inducible system with a red
fluorescent protein reporter that is expressed only upon doxycycline induction. Recombinant
lentiviral particles were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells following a
standard protocol. Briefly, 72 µg of the shRNA plasmid, 54 µg of delta 8.9 plasmid, and 18
µg of VSVG plasmid were transfected using FuGene (Roche) into 293T cells plated in 245
mm2 dishes. Viral supernatant was collected 72 h after transfection, concentrated by
centrifugation at 23,000 rpm, and resuspended in cell growth medium. For transduction,
viral solutions were added to cell culture medium containing 4 µg/mL polybrene; 48 h after
infection, cells were selected using 2 µg/mL puromycin and tested for ENO2 knockdown by
western blotting.

Proliferation assays and anchorage-independent growth

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cell growth of shRNA- or PhAH-treated cell lines was assayed either through crystal violet
staining or using the Promega CellTiter-Glo proliferation kit (Roche) or alternatively, in
vivo, by measuring confluence with the IncuCyte (Essen BioScience). Growth curves using
the IncuCyte were generated by imaging every 2 hours with quadruplicate replicates. For
crystal violet assays, 104 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate for each time point. At the
indicated time point, cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with crystal violet
solution for 1 h. Dye extraction was performed using 10% acetic acid solution, and
absorbance was read at 590 nm. CellTiter-Glo experiments were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions; 103 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate for each time point,
and luminescence readings were taken every 24 h. All experiments were performed in
triplicate. Soft agar (anchorage-independent) growth was monitored in 6-well plates seeded
with 104 cells of the indicated genotype. The medium contained DMEM with 10% FBS; the
top agar contained 0.4% low melting agarose, while the bottom agar contained 1% low
melting agarose. Growth was monitored by fluorescence (GFP) and after 28 days colonies
were stained with iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and counted.
Orthotopic brain tumor formation

Author Manuscript

The in vivo tumorigenic potential of D423-MG cells transduced with non-targeting hairpin
or shENO2-3 delivered through pGIPZ was determined as previously described37. SCID
mice (Charles River) under deep anesthesia were placed into a stereotactic apparatus
equipped with a z axis (Stoelting). Then, 3 × 105 cells were injected intracranially into the
right caudate nucleus 3 mm below the surface of the brain, using a 10-µl Hamilton syringe.
The animals were followed daily for development of neurological deficits. All mice
experiments were performed with the approval of the Harvard Cancer Center and DanaFarber Cancer Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Enolase activity assay
Enolase activity was measured via NADH oxidation in a pyruvate kinase–lactate
dehydrogenase coupled assay as previously described12. Briefly, cells were lysed in 20 mM
Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.4) and homogenized using a
Polytron homogenizer three times for a period of 10 s followed by sonication. Enolase
activity was recorded by measuring oxidation of NADH either spectrophotometrically by
absorbance at 340 nm or fluorescently by excitation at 340 nm and emission at 460 nm.
Western blotting

Author Manuscript

After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were incubated in RIPA
buffer for 15 min with gentle shaking. Lysates were then collected, sonicated, and
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE and western blotting were
performed as described previously37. The following antibodies were used: enolase 1,
CST#3810; enolase 2, #9536; and GAPDH CST# 3683; phosphor-AMPK Thr172 CST#
2535 from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA) and vinculin from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO).

Inhibitor studies

Author Manuscript

PhAH lithium salt was custom synthesized by TCRS (Bristol, PA), following the protocol of
Anderson et al28. Structure and purity were verified by NMR. PhAH was dissolved in PBS
at 50 mM stock and stored frozen at −80 °C until use. Given the instability of the compound,
the medium was replaced every 5 days and fresh inhibitor added with fresh medium.
Rapamycin, sorafenib, lapatinib, and PHA665752 were obtained from LC Laboratories
(Woburn, MA) and Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK), respectively.
Ectopic expression of ENO1, ENO2 and shRNA-resistant ENO2

Author Manuscript

Rescue of the phenotypic effects of knocking down ENO2 in the cell line D423-MG was
performed by overexpressing an shRNA-resistant form of ENO2. Briefly, 6 silent mutations
were introduced into the ENO2 coding region targeted by shENO2-4, using the QuikChange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The shRNA-resistant ENO2 coding region was
cloned into the pHAGE-CMV lentiviral vector (a generous gift of D.N. Kotton) and
overexpressed in the D423-MG cell line carrying shENO2-4, in the presence or absence of
doxycycline. As a control, the same cell line was infected with a lentiviral vector carrying
the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. For the ectopic re-expression of ENO1 or ENO2,
sequenced verified cDNA clones were gateway cloned into the pHAGE-CMV lentiviral
vector and lentivirally transduced into glioma cell lines as described above.
Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

The D423-MG and U373 cell lines were treated for 48 h in the presence or absence of PhAH
(25 µM) and fixed in 75% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The following day, the cells were
washed with cold PBS, treated with 100 µg of RNase A (Qiagen), and stained with 50 µg of
propidium iodide (Roche). Flow cytometric acquisition was performed using a three-color
FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). For each sample, 104
events were gated. Data analysis was performed using ModFit LT (Verity Software House).
Annexin V/7-AAD assay for apoptosis
The D423-MG and U373 cell lines were treated for 96 h in the presence or absence of PhAH
(25 µM). For Annexin V/7-AAD assay cells were stained with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD,
and evaluated for apoptosis by flow cytometry according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Biovision). The apoptotic cells were determined using a Becton-Dickinson FACScan
cytometer. Both early apoptotic (annexin V-positive, 7-AAD-negative) and late apoptotic
(annexin V-positive and 7-AAD-positive) cells were included in cell death determinations.

Figure 1. Homozygous deletions in ENO1 sensitize tumors to molecular targeting of ENO2

Author Manuscript

a, ENO1 is homozygously deleted in glioblastomas as part of the 1p36 locus. Loss of ENO1
is tolerable to the tumor because ENO2 is still expressed. b, A specific inhibitor of ENO2
should completely eliminate enolase activity in ENO1 null tumor cells (hence blocking
glycolysis and ATP synthesis) but leave genomically intact normal tissues unaffected
because enolase activity is still present because ENO1 is still expressed.

Figure 2. Homozygous deletion of the 1p36 locus in GBM results in loss of ENO1 expression in
primary tumors and cell lines

a, TCGA Affymetrix aCGH data show four primary GBMs with log2 copy number < −1,
indicating homozygous deletion of the 1p36 locus. b, DNA copy number correlates with
mRNA expression; expression is highest in tumors with n = 2 copies (WT) and lowest in
tumors with n = 0 copies (null) of ENO1. c, The D423-MG cell line was identified as
homozygously deleted by SNP arrays from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute data set. d,
The complete absence of enolase 1 protein in D423-MG and Gli56 cells was confirmed by

Figure 3. shRNA ablation of ENO2 affects ENO1-null but not ENO1-WT GBM cells

a, shRNA ablation by two independent doxycycline (Dox)-inducible TRIPZ hairpins against
ENO2 (shENO2-3, shENO2-4) resulted in >70% reduction in enolase 2 protein levels in
both ENO1 WT (A1207, U87, LN319) and ENO1-null (D423-MG) cell lines. b, Ablation of
ENO2 dramatically inhibited growth of ENO1-null but not ENO1 WT cells, whereas nontargeting shRNA against luciferase (shLuc) had no effect in any cell line (n=3 biological
replicates, S.E.M, t-test). Representative plates at the last time point of growth for cells

Figure 4. Extreme sensitivity of ENO1-null cells to the pan-enolase inhibitor PhAH

Author Manuscript

a, D423-MG and Gli56 ENO1-null lines are highly sensitive to PhAH toxicity while ENO1
WT cell lines and normal astrocytes are not. b, The sensitivity of GBM lines to PhAH
treatment correlated with their overall enolase activity. Pre-incubation of the lysates with 1
µM PhAH inhibited enolase enzymatic activity by >95% (average, n = 2 technical
replicates). c, PhAH minimally affected the growth of ENO1 WT GBM cells and normal
astrocytes except at concentrations higher than 50 µM. Low concentrations of PhAH stall
the growth of ENO1-null cells, while ENO1 heterozygous cells (D502-MG and U343)
showed intermediate sensitivity (n = 4 biological replicates, S.E.M.).
