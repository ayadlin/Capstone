Abstract
The CTTN gene ( formerly designated EMS1), encodes cortactin, a key regulator of dynamic actin networks. Both CTTN and
CCND1, the latter encoding the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1,
reside at chromosomal locus 11q13, a region commonly
amplified in breast cancers and head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC). Previously, we identified a novel role for
cortactin in cancer cells, whereby cortactin overexpression
attenuated ligand-induced down-regulation of the epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), leading to sustained
signaling. However, how this affected growth factor–induced
cellular responses was unclear. Here, by modulation of
cortactin expression in a panel of HNSCC cell lines, we show
that cortactin overexpression enhances serum- and EGFstimulated proliferation under both anchorage-dependent
and anchorage-independent conditions and also increases
resistance to anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis). These
effects are associated with increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and/or AKT. Furthermore, we
report that cortactin stabilizes the c-MET receptor tyrosine
kinase and enhances hepatocyte growth factor–induced mitogenesis and cell scattering. Therefore, cortactin may modulate
signaling by a broader range of receptors than originally
proposed and thereby affect a variety of responses. Finally,
we have determined that cortactin overexpression, either
alone or in combination with cyclin D1 up-regulation,
promotes resistance to the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib.
These findings indicate that cortactin may play multiple roles
in progression of HNSCC and should be evaluated as a marker
of prognosis, disease progression, and therapeutic responsiveness, particularly to EGFR-directed agents. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents
a major worldwide health problem with patients exhibiting a
5-year survival rate of <50%, and despite intense efforts, this rate
has not improved in the last 30 years (1, 2). Among the molecular
alterations associated with development and progression of this
disease are overexpression and/or mutation of particular receptor

tyrosine kinases (RTK). For example, increased expression of
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) or its ligand,
transforming growth factor-a, occurs in the majority of HNSCCs
and elevated levels of these proteins are associated with reduced
disease-free survival (3). This has led to ongoing clinical trials of
two types of EGFR-selective therapeutic agent in this disease:
small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib and
erlotinib) and monoclonal antibodies (mAb; e.g., cetuximab).
Although these molecules exhibit modest activities as single
agents, a combination of anti-EGFR strategies with cytotoxic
chemotherapy or radiation therapy has seen improvements in
response rates and patient survival (4, 5). Another RTK
implicated in HNSCC progression is the receptor for hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), c-MET. Activation of this receptor, like the
EGFR, promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival but also
markedly enhances cell scattering, motility, and invasion (6).
Consistent with the latter biological effects, overexpression or
mutation of c-MET is implicated in the metastatic spread of
HNSCC (7, 8).
A further characteristic of head and neck cancers, as well as those
of the breast, esophagus, lung, and bladder, is amplification of
chromosomal locus 11q13. This occurs in f40% of HNSCCs and is
associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis and poor
prognosis (ref. 9 and references therein). The CCND1 gene, encoding
the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1, and the CTTN gene
( formerly designated EMS1), encoding the actin-binding protein
cortactin, localize to this region. In breast cancers, CTTN and
CCND1 are located on separate 11q13 amplicons that can be
amplified independently (9). Studies by our group on a large breast
cancer cohort revealed that CTTN was amplified independently of
CCND1 in a subset of samples and that there was no association
between the degree of amplification of these two genes. Furthermore, amplification of CTTN, unlike that of CCND1, was associated
with an increased risk of relapse and death in patients with estrogen receptor–negative disease (10). Subsequent work by Rodrigo et
al. (11) extended these findings to HNSCC, where amplification of
CTTN, but not CCND1, predicted early recurrence and reduced
survival. More recently, cortactin, but not cyclin D1, overexpression
was found to associate with lymph node metastasis of esophageal
squamous cell carcinomas (12). Taken together, these data strongly
suggest that cortactin plays a key, albeit incompletely understood,
role in cancers with 11q13 amplification.
The function of cortactin is to promote the formation of
dendritic actin networks critical to such processes as cell motility
and receptor-mediated endocytosis (13). This stems from the
ability of cortactin to bind the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3
complex and F-actin via its NH2-terminal acidic and repeat regions,

respectively, and to stimulate the actin nucleation activity of Arp2/
3 alone or in combination with N-WASP. In addition, cortactin
stabilizes branched actin networks (13). Studies on a variety of cell
types, including 11q13-amplified HNSCC cells, have shown that
cortactin overexpression enhances cell migration and invasion
in vitro (13, 14). Supporting the hypothesis that cortactin promotes
tumor invasion and systemic spread, overexpression of this protein
in cancer cells increases metastasis in nude mouse models (12, 15).
However, effects of cortactin on cell proliferation have not been
reported.
Recently, we discovered that overexpression of cortactin in
HNSCC cells attenuates ligand-induced down-regulation of the
EGFR, leading to sustained receptor signaling to the mitogenic
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathway (16). This highlighted a potential oncogenic
role for cortactin, although important questions that remained
included the specificity of this effect and its biological consequences. To address these issues, we have used complementary
strategies to alter cortactin expression in HNSCC cells and then
characterized a variety of cellular responses relevant to the
malignant phenotype and clinical treatment of this disease. The
findings shed new light on the role of cortactin and 11q13
amplification in HNSCC.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids. The pRcCMV/cortactin construct was as described previously
(17). The mouse cortactin cDNA in pBabePuro was a kind gift from
Dr. Danielle Lynch (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).
Tissue culture and generation of stable cell lines. The HNSCC cell
lines Fadu, Detroit 562, Scc9, Scc15, and Scc25 were maintained as
described previously (16, 18). Scc9 and Scc25 cells were transfected with
pRcCMV/cortactin or empty vector using PolyFect (Qiagen Pty Ltd.)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Stable pools were generated in the
presence of 500 Ag/mL geneticin (Life Technologies). Scc9 clones F5 and F7
overexpressing cyclin D1 (18) were transfected with pBabePuro/cortactin or
the empty vector and stable pools were selected in the presence of 1 Ag/mL
puromycin (Sigma).
Suppression of cortactin expression by small interfering RNA. Three
RNAs were chemically synthesized (Ambion, Inc.) based on the sequence
5¶-GACUGGUUUUGGAGGCAAAUUUU-3¶ (19), 5¶-AAGCUGAGGGAGAAUGUCUUGU-3¶ (19), and 5¶-AAGACUGAGAAGCAUGCCUCTCC-3¶ [small
interfering RNA (siRNA) 3; ref. 20]. Knockdowns used either siRNA 1 or a
mixture of siRNA 2 and siRNA 3 (20), with similar results. A siRNA against
lamin A/C or green fluorescent protein was used as a control. For
annealing of siRNA, 20 AL of each single-stranded RNA (50 Amol/L) were
incubated with 10 AL 5 annealing buffer [100 mmol/L potassium acetate,
2 mmol/L magnesium acetate, 30 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4)] for 1 min at
90jC and then 1 h at 37jC. The RNA duplexes were then stored at 20jC
until use. One day before transfection, Fadu or Detroit 562 cells were plated
at 1.4  105 cells per well in six-well plates. Each well contained 2 mL
medium. For transfection of the cells in one well, 3 AL siRNA duplex
(20 Amol/L) was diluted into 200 AL Opti-MEM (Invitrogen Corp.) in tube
1. In tube 2, 12 AL Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was added to 48 AL OptiMEM. Tubes 1 and 2 were incubated for 7 to 10 min at room temperature
before combining the solutions. Following incubation for 20 to 25 min at
room temperature, 152 AL Opti-MEM was added to the mixture, which was
then added to the cells. Efficient knockdown of cortactin on siRNA
treatment persisted for 5 to 6 days.
Growth factor treatment of cells. Cells were starved overnight in
serum-free medium and then simulated for the indicated time period with
10 to 100 ng/mL HGF (R&D Systems) as indicated.
Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. Cell lysates
were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (21) containing
10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,

www.aacrjournals.org

and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were
determined using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Samples were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
(Millipore), and subjected to Western blot analysis. Detection of bound
antibodies was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences
Pty Ltd.).
Antibodies. The cortactin monoclonal 4F11 antibody and c-MET mAb
were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. Polyclonal antibodies
specific for phosphorylated ERK (T202/Y204), AKT (S473), and Rb (S780),
as well as antibodies against total ERK and AKT, were from Cell Signaling
Technology. The mAbs against cyclin D1 (clone DCS6) and total Rb
were from Novacastra Laboratories and BD PharMingen, respectively. The
h-actin mAb (clone AC-15) was purchased from Sigma.
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was done on a FACSCalibur with
CellQuest 2.0 software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) and
analysis used ModFit LT analysis software (Verity Software House, Inc.).
Proliferation assays and determination of gefitinib resistance. Cells
(500–2,000) were plated in 96-well microtiter plates (six replicates per
treatment) according to the growth characteristics and optimal plating
densities for the respective lines (18). Cells were incubated overnight to
allow attachment before addition of growth factors or gefitinib (a gift
from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) at time 0. Assays to determine
gefitinib sensitivity were done in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and vehicle control cells were treated with the equivalent
concentration of DMSO. Cell proliferation was determined using the
CellTiter 96 assay (Promega) in accordance with manufacturer’s
instructions at multiple time points as indicated or after 5 days for IC50
determination.
Colony-forming assays. These were done as described previously (18).
Cells (6,000–12,000) were plated in six-well plates, observed twice weekly,
and fixed and stained with Diff-Quick stain (Lab Aids) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s directions. Images were captured using a Leica DFC280
camera with Leica Firecam software (version 1.9) and colonies containing
greater than f40 cells were quantified using the ImageJ software (version
1.34s) particle analysis module.
Anchorage-independent growth. This was assayed by determining the
ability of cells to form colonies and grow in soft agar. DMEM/F12
containing 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (w/v) DNA grade agarose (Quantum
Scientific) was prepared at 37jC and 2 mL/well, added to six-well plates,
and allowed to set at room temperature to form the bottom agarose layer.
Cells (1  103) were resuspended in DMEM/F12 containing 10% (v/v) FBS
and 0.3% (w/v) DNA grade agarose at 37jC and plated on top of the bottom
layer. The upper layer was allowed to set at room temperature and then
overlayed with 1 mL DMEM/F12. EGF or HGF (100 ng/mL) was added to
the bottom and top layer as indicated (22). All assays were done in triplicate
and were incubated for 21 days. Images of colonies were captured using
a Leica DFC280 camera with Leica Firecam software (version 1.9) and
colonies >100 Am in diameter were counted.
Anoikis. Anoikis was induced by preventing cell attachment using plates
coated with poly-HEMA (Sigma). A stock solution of 120 mg/mL polyHEMA in 100% ethanol was prepared and diluted to 5 mg/mL in 95%
ethanol. This solution (0.1 mL/cm2) was pipetted into six-well plates and
left to dry at room temperature in a sterile environment. Before use, wells
were washed with PBS. Cells (5  104 per well) were suspended in DMEM/
F12 containing 10% (v/v) FBS (2 mL/well) and incubated in poly-HEMA–
coated wells for 36 h at 37jC. Anoikis was assayed by determination of the
sub-G1 (apoptotic) fraction of cells by flow cytometry as described
previously (23). All experiments were repeated in triplicate and mean
values were reported.
Colony dissociation assay. Evaluation of colony dispersion (cell
scattering) was done as described previously (24). Briefly, cells were
subcultured and maintained in growth medium in six-well plates until
colonies were established. Cultures were deprived of growth factors and
serum for 16 h before treatment with HGF (100 ng/mL) for 18 h. Colony
dispersion was documented by photography using a Leica DFC280 camera
with Leica Firecam software (version 1.9). Representative images of at least
six independent experiments are shown.

Results
Overexpression of cortactin in HNSCC cells promotes cell
proliferation and mitogenic signaling. We showed previously
that high cortactin expression impairs EGFR down-regulation
leading to sustained receptor signaling (16). We therefore explored
the biological consequences of this effect using a panel of five
HNSCC cell lines. Fadu, Detroit 562, and Scc15 cells feature 11q13
amplification and/or cortactin overexpression and express high
levels of the EGFR. Scc9 and Scc25 cells also display EGFR
overexpression; however, these cells have a normal 11q13 copy
number and cortactin levels (Fig. 1A; refs. 18, 25). To determine
the functional effects of altered cortactin expression, we isolated
stable pools of Scc9 and Scc25 cells overexpressing cortactin via
transfection or suppressed its expression in both Fadu and Detroit
562 cells to levels intermediate between Scc25 and Scc15 cells using
cortactin selective-siRNAs (Fig. 1B).
In agreement with our previous work (16), stable pools of
cortactin-overexpressing Scc9 cells exhibited impaired EGFR
down-regulation and sustained ERK activation (data not shown).
Therefore, we determined whether this was associated with
enhanced cell proliferation. Under anchorage-dependent conditions and in 10% FBS, cortactin-transfected cells proliferated faster
than vector control cells (Fig. 1C). To confirm that cortactin could
enhance EGF-dependent proliferation, we repeated this assay in 1%
FBS supplemented with EGF. Consistent with the effect of cortactin
on EGFR down-regulation, proliferation under these conditions
was also enhanced by cortactin overexpression (Fig. 1C). Similar
effects were observed in two independent stable pools of Scc9 cells,
and in stable pools of transfected Scc25 cells, as well as on
transient transfection of a cortactin expression construct (data not
shown).
To complement these data, we suppressed cortactin expression
in 11q13-amplified Fadu and Detroit cells using selective siRNAs.
Reduction of cortactin levels in Fadu cells by RNA interference
accelerates ligand-induced EGFR down-regulation and attenuates
receptor signaling (16), and consistent with these data, cortactin
knockdown impaired the proliferation rate of Fadu cells, both in
10% FBS and in 1% FBS + EGF (Fig. 1C). Similar results were
observed in Detroit 562 cells (data not shown).
We then plated cells at low density and subjected them to colony
formation assays (18). Under both serum-supplemented or EGFdependent conditions, overexpression of cortactin in Scc9 and
Scc25 cells increased both the number and size of colonies,
whereas the converse effects were observed on cortactin knockdown in Fadu and Detroit cells (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that
cortactin not only confers a proliferative advantage as shown by
increased colony size but also may enhance cell survival, as
indicated by increased colony number.
In the colony formation assays, Fadu cells with cortactin
knockdown exhibited a significantly reduced percentage of cells
in S phase (Fig. 2A), indicating that elevated cortactin levels
promote G1 phase progression. Furthermore, phosphorylation of
the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a critical regulator of the G1-S
phase transition, on Ser780 was reduced in siRNA-treated Fadu cells,
and these cells predominantly exhibited the lower hypophosphorylated form of Rb (Fig. 2A). To characterize the mechanistic basis for
this effect, we determined the activation status of growth factor
receptor signaling pathways during the colony formation assays.
In Fadu and Detroit 562 cells that had knockdown of cortactin,
we detected significantly lower levels of activated ERK and also

decreased phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473, the latter indicative of
reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (Fig. 2B).
In the complementary experiment, Scc9 cells overexpressing
cortactin exhibited enhanced activation of these pathways
(Fig. 2C). Because both ERK and AKT regulate G1-S transition by
promoting the assembly and/or activation of cyclin D1/cyclindependent kinase (Cdk) 4 and cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes that target
Rb (26), these data explain the increased proportion of cells in
S phase observed on cortactin overexpression.
Taken together, these data show for the first time that cortactin
provides a proliferative advantage to HNSCC cells that is
commensurate with its ability to potentiate growth factor signaling
pathways.
Cortactin overexpression attenuates c-MET down-regulation and enhances HGF-induced biological responses. Because
we observed an increase in proliferation in cortactin-overexpressing cells maintained in 10% FBS, where cells are exposed to a
variety of mitogens, we decided to explore whether cortactin
overexpression affected the regulation of other growth factor
receptors. The HGF receptor, c-MET, is strongly implicated in the
development and progression of head and neck cancer (6–8).
Therefore, we transiently transfected Scc9 cells with the empty
vector or a cortactin expression construct and then assayed the
extent of HGF-induced c-MET down-regulation at specific time
points (Fig. 3A). This revealed that in vector-transfected cells,
c-MET levels were reduced to 80% of starting levels at 60 min and
to 30% at 120 min. However, in cortactin-overexpressing cells,
a reduction in c-MET was not detected until 90 min of stimulation,
when levels were 80% of their starting value, and no further
decrease was observed at 120 min. Thus, c-MET down-regulation
was both delayed and attenuated on cortactin overexpression. In
addition, at 120 min, activation of p44 and p42 ERK was increased
by 2.1- and 1.4-fold, respectively, in cortactin-overexpressing cells
relative to controls. AKT activation was also enhanced at this time
point, showing that cortactin overexpression leads to more
sustained HGF-induced signaling. To complement this approach,
we characterized c-MET down-regulation in Detroit cells, which
express high endogenous levels of cortactin. In control cells, there
was a very little HGF-induced receptor degradation over a 120-min
time course (Fig. 3A). However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
cortactin markedly accelerated c-MET down-regulation in these
cells (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the effect of cortactin on receptor downregulation is not restricted to the EGFR and may affect multiple
growth factor receptors.
To characterize the biological effects of impaired c-MET downregulation, HNSCC cells exhibiting altered cortactin expression
were subjected to proliferation or colony-forming assays in 1%
FBS + HGF. Consistently, high cortactin expression was associated
with an increased rate of proliferation and enhanced colony
formation (Fig. 3B and C). Although a well-characterized response
to c-MET activation is dispersal of epithelial colonies (6), this was
not observed for Fadu and Detroit cells at the concentration of
HGF used (10 ng/mL).
We then determined the effect of cortactin overexpression on cell
scattering induced by a high concentration of HGF (100 ng/mL).
This response was markedly enhanced in the cortactin-overexpressing Scc9 pool (Fig. 3D). Consequently, the ability of c-MET
to promote both cell proliferation and dispersal is enhanced on
cortactin overexpression. Interestingly, similar effects on c-MET–
regulated responses were observed when receptor down-regulation
was attenuated via mutation of the direct binding site for c-Cbl (27).

Cortactin overexpression enhances anchorage-independent
growth and protects against anoikis. An important characteristic of the transformed phenotype is the ability to grow under
anchorage-independent conditions. Therefore, we determined
whether cortactin could enhance the growth of HNSCC cells in
soft agar and modulate cellular responsiveness to specific growth
factors under these conditions. When cultured in 10% FBS,
cortactin-transfected Scc9 cells formed significantly more colonies
in soft agar than the corresponding vector controls (Fig. 4A).
Interestingly, although the addition of either EGF or HGF enhanced
colony formation for both the cortactin-transfected and control
cells, the increase was greater for the former pool. These data are
consistent with the ability of cortactin to enhance signaling by both
the EGFR (16) and c-MET (Fig. 3).
The effect of cortactin on anchorage-independent growth
suggested that it may also provide protection from detachmentinduced apoptosis (anoikis). When plated as a semiconfluent
monolayer, cortactin-overexpressing Scc9 cells exhibited a low level
of apoptosis that was not significantly different from vector
controls. Culture on poly-HEMA to prevent cell attachment
resulted in a marked increase in apoptotic cell death for both

cell populations, but cortactin-overexpressing cells exhibited a
significant survival advantage compared with vector controls
(Fig. 4B). This was associated with increased activation of AKT
(Fig. 4B), but not ERK (data not shown), in detached cells relative
to controls. Consistent with these data, knockdown of cortactin in
Detroit cells enhanced anoikis (data not shown). Therefore,
depending on the conditions, cortactin can enhance either the
proliferation or survival of HNSCC cells, and both effects may
contribute to increased colony formation in soft agar.
Cortactin promotes resistance to the EGFR kinase inhibitor
gefitinib. A major requirement for the effective clinical use of
EGFR-targeted agents is the identification of markers of therapeutic
responsiveness. Our observation that cortactin attenuates downregulation of the EGFR (16) and enhances mitogenic signaling
induced by serum and specific growth factors (Figs. 1–4) raised
the important question of how cortactin overexpression might
affect cellular sensitivity to gefitinib. Furthermore, deregulated
expression of cyclin D1, which is also encoded at chromosome
11q13, leads to increased resistance to gefitinib in vitro (18).
Because overexpression of both cortactin and cyclin D1 occurs in
HNSCC (28), cells with aberrant levels of both proteins might

exhibit altered sensitivity to this drug compared with those overexpressing either protein alone.
Earlier work examining the differential sensitivity of cancer cells
to gefitinib classified sensitive cells as having a IC50 of 0.07 to
1.4 Amol/L and resistant cell lines as having a IC50 of 3 to 16 Amol/L
(29). Consistent with previous studies, Scc9 cells (that have low
cortactin and cyclin D1 expression) fell within the sensitive range,
and this was not significantly affected by vector transfection
(Fig. 5A; ref. 18). In contrast, Fadu and Detroit cells (that have
11q13 amplification and high expression of both proteins)
exhibited a IC50 of f20 Amol/L, placing them in the gefitinibresistant category. Overexpression of cortactin in Scc9 cells led to a
shift in the dose-response curve to the right, indicating decreased

sensitivity to the drug (Fig. 5A). However, as with cyclin D1
overexpression (18), the level of resistance observed was not as
marked as with Fadu or Detroit cells.
To determine the effect of combined overexpression of cortactin
and cyclin D1, two clonal Scc9 lines engineered to overexpress
cyclin D1 (F5.cyclin D1 and F7.cyclin D1; ref. 18) were transfected
with the cortactin expression vector. The resulting doubly transfected pools clearly overexpressed cortactin, but not to the same
level as the Fadu or Detroit lines (Fig. 5B). Determination of the
gefitinib sensitivity of these lines and their respective controls
revealed that although cyclin D1 overexpression reduced the effect
of this drug, cortactin conferred further resistance (Fig. 5C).
Indeed, the IC50 values for the Scc9 pools overexpressing both

cortactin and cyclin D1 (both f10 Amol/L) were of similar
magnitude to those for Detroit and Fadu cells.
To characterize the mechanistic basis for this effect, we assayed
the effect of gefitinib on specific signaling pathways. Although
gefitinib treatment of cells with low cortactin levels resulted in a
marked inhibition of ERK and AKT activation, this effect was
completely lost or significantly attenuated in cells with high
cortactin expression (Fig. 6A). This also occurred in the independently generated lines exhibiting combined overexpression of
cortactin and cyclin D1 (Fig. 6B; data not shown). Therefore,
cortactin promotes gefitinib resistance by buffering specific growth
factor signaling pathways against the action of this drug.

Discussion
Oncogenic subversion of RTK signaling commonly involves
evasion of ligand-induced down-regulation by endocytosis (30).
Previously, we reported that overexpression of cortactin represents a novel mechanism whereby cancer cells attenuate EGFR
down-regulation, leading to sustained signaling (16). In this study,
we have addressed the specificity and biological consequences of

this effect, providing novel insights into the role of cortactin in
HNSCC.
Although effects of cortactin on cell proliferation have not been
reported previously, our data clearly indicate that cortactin
overexpression enhances proliferation of HNSCC cells in response
to both EGF and HGF. This was evident in monolayer proliferation and colony formation assays and also under anchorageindependent conditions, where the differential in colony size
between control and cortactin-overexpressing cells was significantly enhanced by the presence of these growth factors. These
findings are consistent with the ability of cortactin to promote
sustained signaling by the EGFR (16) and c-MET. However, seruminduced mitogenic signaling and proliferation were also increased.
Under these conditions, cortactin may amplify signaling by
additional RTKs and possibly other receptor types. For the EGFR,
cortactin-mediated attenuation of down-regulation is associated
with decreased coupling of the EGFR to the E3 ubiquitin ligase
c-Cbl (16), and because c-MET is also subject to this negative
control mechanism (27), this probably underlies the effect of
cortactin on c-MET degradation. However, the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit are also regulated by

Consequently, cortactin may also modulate down-regulation and

finding indicates that aberrant cortactin expression may alter

for example by perturbing the normally transient association of
actin networks with the endocytic machinery (19, 33), and
supports the hypothesis that the effects of cortactin on mitogenic
receptor signaling may not be solely mediated via the tyrosine
kinase class of growth factor receptors.
In addition to enhancing cell proliferation, cortactin overexpression affected two other biological responses relevant to
cancer progression. First, it increased HGF-induced scattering of
Scc9 cells. This is consistent with the sustained activation of ERK
and PI3K in response to HGF treatment, as both pathways

contribute to disassembly of adherens junctions on c-MET
stimulation (34). Second, it significantly reduced anoikis, which
likely reflects the increased levels of activated AKT detected in
cortactin-overexpressing, detached cells. A prosurvival role for
AKT under these conditions has been documented (35) and may
be mediated via suppression of Bim, phosphorylation of Bad, or
up-regulation of prosurvival Bcl2 family proteins (36). Lending
support to this hypothesis, knockdown of cortactin in 11q13amplified esophageal cancer cells enhances anoikis and decreases
AKT activation (12). Overall, our findings and those of others

indicate that cortactin may contribute, albeit via different
mechanisms, to multiple stages of tumor progression. These
include proliferation of cells within the primary tumor, dissolution
of cell-cell contacts, cell invasion (13), and systemic spread (12, 15).
Importantly, the ability of cortactin to promote proliferative and
survival signaling provides a more satisfactory explanation for
CTTN amplification in primary tumors than its motogenic effects.
Cortactin plays a direct role in regulating actin reorganization
during cell migration, binding and activating the Arp2/3 complex,
and stabilizing branched actin networks (13). Indeed, in vivo,
cortactin binds preferentially to dynamic actin filaments, and
cortactin-knockdown cells exhibit a lower production of uncapped
actin filament barbed ends at the leading edge and a reduced
persistence of lamellipodial protrusions (37). However, in light of
the data presented in this article, an important consideration about
interpretation of the effects of cortactin overexpression on cell
motility is that enhanced motogenic responses could be due to
both increased activation of specific signaling effectors (due to
effects of cortactin on receptor down-regulation) and direct effects
of cortactin on actin dynamics. For example, the increased ERK
signaling we observe in cortactin-overexpressing cells could
promote motility by increasing phosphorylation of paxillin, thereby
regulating focal adhesion turnover (38), or myosin light chain
kinase, hence promoting contraction at the rear of the cell (39). The
need to consider the potential effects of cortactin on cell signaling
pathways is further highlighted by the recent work of Luo et al. (32).
Here, although expression of a cortactin mutant defective in Srcmediated phosphorylation inhibited CXCL12-induced chemotaxis,
consistent with other functional studies examining the role of
cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation (13), this mutant also inhibited
ERK phosphorylation induced by this chemokine (32). Consequently, future analyses of cortactin-regulated migration will need
to consider both the direct and indirect mechanisms whereby
cortactin can regulate this process.
Interestingly, cells exhibiting high levels of cortactin were less
sensitive to the EGFR-selective inhibitor gefitinib. This might occur
due to altered endosomal trafficking in cortactin-overexpressing
cells, leading to increased dissociation of gefitinib-EGFR complexes
in low pH endosomes. Alternatively, in light of our observation
that the effects of cortactin on receptor down-regulation extend
to c-MET and the recent report that cortactin can also modulate
G protein–coupled receptor signaling (32), cortactin may amplify

proliferative signals from other receptors and thereby reduce
cellular dependency on the EGFR. This is consistent with reports
that depending on cell type, c-MET, the insulin-like growth factor-I
receptor or PDGFRh can bypass the EGFR for mitogenic stimuli
and promote gefitinib resistance (40–42). Also of note, cortactin
further enhanced gefitinib resistance conferred by overexpression
of cyclin D1, a cell cycle regulator also encoded at the 11q13 locus.
Because gefitinib resistance due to CCND1 amplification and/or
cyclin D1 overexpression is associated with maintenance of cyclin
D1 protein levels after drug treatment (18), the enhanced growth
factor signaling that occurs in cortactin-overexpressing cells may
block drug-induced modulation of other key regulators of the G1-S
phase transition, such as cyclin E and/or p27 (26, 43).
In summary, the data presented in this article and our earlier
study (16) provide strong evidence that cortactin overexpression
potentiates growth factor–induced signaling and biological
responses. Because cortactin overexpression in both breast cancers
(44) and HNSCCs (14) is tightly linked to CTTN amplification, this
provides a novel explanation for the selective pressure underlying
amplification of this 11q13-localized gene. In some breast cancers
and HNSCCs, CTTN can be amplified in the absence of CCND1
amplification (10, 11), indicating that it can contribute to tumor
progression independently of the latter oncogene, presumably by
promoting proliferative and/or survival signaling. In others,
coamplification occurs (10, 11), which may result in functional
cooperation between the cell cycle regulatory role of cyclin D1 and
the biological effects of cortactin. The ability of these two proteins
to exert cooperative effects on cancer cell phenotype is highlighted
by the further modulation of gefitinib sensitivity that occurs on
their combined overexpression. Therefore, cyclin D1 and cortactin
should be evaluated further as markers of response to EGFRdirected therapies.
