Abstract
Human trophoblastic cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) has been reported to act
oncogenically. In this study, one-step quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) test and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis with were employed
to evaluate the relationship between Trop2 expression and the clinicopathological
features of patients with PC. Then a novel anti-Trop2 Fab antibody was conjugated
with Doxorubicin (DOX) to form Trop2Fab-DOX, an antibody-drug conjugate. This
Trop2Fab- DOX conjugate was characterized by cell ELISA and immunofluorescence
assay. MTT and wound healing analyses were used to evaluate the inhibitory effect
of Trop2Fab-DOX on PC cell growth in vitro, while xenograft nude mice model
was established to examine the tumor-inhibitory effects of PC in vivo. High Trop2
expression was observed in PC tissues and Trop2 expression was associated with
several malignant attributes of PC patients, including overall survival. Trop2Fab-DOX
can bind to the Trop2-expressing PC cells and provide an improved releasing type
of DOX. In addition, Trop2Fab-DOX inhibited the proliferation and suppressed the
migration of PC cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, while inhibited the growth
of PC xenografts in vivo. Trop2 is a specific marker for PC, and a novel Trop2Fab-DOX
ADC has a potent antitumor activity

Introduction

merely relies on chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although
some novel approaches have been introduced for PC
treatment in latest years, none can effectively improve its
overall survival [5, 6]. It is thereby of timely importance
to develop a novel treatment strategy that can predict the
prognosis and improve therapeutic outcome in patients
with PC.
Human trophoblastic cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2),
also known as TACSTD2, EGP-1 or GA733-1, is a

Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is one of the most
aggressive forms of digestive tract malignancies, and it
ranks eighth in cancer-related mortality worldwide [1, 2].
The prognosis of patients with PC is extremely poor, with
a 5-year survival rate of 1–4%, typically because of high
lethality, delayed diagnosis, early metastasis, and severe
progression [3, 4]. So far, conventional PC treatment

and 71 of 155 (45.8%) PC tissues. In comparison, high
Trop2 expression in cytoplasm and stroma was only
witnessed in 6 of 87 (6.90%) and 3 of 87 (3.44%) noncancerous tissues. The differences of Trop2 expression
(in both cytoplasm and stroma) between PC tissues and
non-cancerous tissues were statistically significant (both
p < 0.05).
The typical IHC staining for Trop2 expression and
its relationship with important clinical characteristics in
patients with PC are presented in Figure 1B and Table 1,
respectively. High Trop2 expression in cytoplasm was
significantly correlated with tumor location (p = 0.046),
lymph nodes metastasis (p = 0.027), and TNM stage
(p = 0.031), while high Trop2 expression in stroma
was remarkably associated with perineural invasion
(p = 0.024), vascular invasion (p = 0.047), lymph nodes
metastasis (p = 0.020) and TNM stage (p = 0.003).

cell-surface glycoprotein, and belongs to the TACSTD
gene family [7–9]. Trop2 expression was detected in a
variety of human cancer cells, and its elevated expression
is often associated with poor prognoses of breast, colon,
and gastric cancers [10–12]. Moreover, the distribution
of Trop2 is more differentiated in human cancers,
suggestive of a certain oncogenic characteristic of Trop2
as a promising novel target for personalized treatment
[13, 14].
Trop2 antibody has been constructed and tested by
our former research, and human anti-Trop2 engineering
antibody was used in immunohistochemistry (IHC)
analysis [15] to investigate the inhibitory effectiveness
of anti-Trop2 Fab antibody (Trop2Fab) in breast
cancer [16]. For practical use, it is of added interest to
motivate the application of Trop2Fab in cancer therapy
with a more extended scale or circumstance, such as
developing an antibody that can block the Trop2/MAPK
pathway or conjugating an antibody with immunotoxins,
radioimmunoconjugates or chemotherapy drugs [17].
Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most common
chemotherapy drugs, and has been widely administrated
in the clinical treatment for PC. Although patients under
DOX therapy often experience serious side effects, such
as heart failure, kidney toxicity and myelosuppression
[18], DOX has some advantages for the research of
antibody-drug conjugates, including high solubility,
simple detectability and easy observability [19].
Recently, a number of drug molecules and delivery
systems for DOX application have been developed with
a promising prospect [20–22]. Based on the above, we
hypothesized that a conjugate of Trop2Fab with DOX
(Trop2Fab-DOX) could not only benefit from the high
specificity of Trop2Fab fragment and but also reduce the
possibility of side effects from DOX, as doing so can
help characterize and optimize the clinical application
of Trop2Fab.
To fill this void in knowledge, we first examined
Trop2 expression in PC tissues and evaluated its
relationship with the clinicopathological attributes of
patients with PC. We next conjugated Trop2Fab with DOX
to form an antibody-drug (Trop2Fab-DOX) conjugate.
Further, we explored the antitumor effect of this Trop2FabDOX conjugate in vitro and in vivo.

Survival analysis
Both univariate and multivariate analyses
consistently revealed that cytoplasm expression of Trop2
was the most significant predictor for poor survival in
189 patients with PC (p = 0.002 and 0.013, respectively)
(Table 2). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves also
demonstrated that PC patients with high Trop2 expression
suffered a significantly shorter survival time (Figure 1C).

Characterization of Trop2Fab
The Trop2Fab was previously constructed in our
laboratory [16] and was further characterized in this present
study. In FACS analysis, the population of Trop2Fabtreated BxPc3 and PL45 cells was clearly separated from
untreated cells by fluorescent intensity, with no observable
difference between Trop2Fab-treated and untreated
NIH3T3 cells (Figure 2A). In immunofluorescence assay,
Trop2Fab was found to combine with BxPc3 and PL45
cells, and positive green signals were mainly detected
around cell surface. In contrast, NIH3T3 cells exhibited
negative signals (Figure 2B).

Characterization of Trop2Fab-DOX
After the conjugation of Trop2Fab with DOX, the
DOX release profiles were detected. As is shown in Figure
4A and 4B, the DOX release behavior from Trop2FabDOX was stable in pH 7.2 PBS, and the amount of
cumulated DOX release reached nearly 15.0% over 7 days
(Figure 3A). In comparison, the DOX was easier to release
in pH 4.0 PBS than that in pH 7.2 PBS, and almost 90.0%
DOX was released within 5 days (Figure 3B). It is mainly
due to that the amide bond of Trop2Fab-DOX is solid
in neutral solutions while vulnerable in acidic solutions.
Moreover, as shown in cell ELISA analysis (Figure 3C),
both Trop2Fab-DOX and Trop2Fab could specifically bind
to BxPc3 and PL45 cells in a dose-dependent manner,

Results
Detection of Trop2 expression by qPCR and IHC
analyses
For qPCR analysis, the expression of Trop2
mRNA was significantly higher in PC tissues than in the
corresponding non-cancerous tissues when normalized to
GAPDH (4.6 ± 0.38 vs. 3.2 ± 0.31, p = 0.009) (Figure 1A).
For IHC analysis, high Trop2 expression in cytoplasm and
stroma was respectively detected in 114 of 189 (60.3%)

while there was barely any binding to NIH3T3 cells.
Absorbance values of Trop2Fab-DOX and Trop2Fab in
Trop2-positive and -negative cells differed significantly.
In immunofluorescence assay, Trop2Fab-DOX could
specifically bind to Trop2-positive BxPc3 and PL45 cells.
The cells treated with Trop2Fab-DOX exhibited green
fluorescence around cell surface, while no signal was
detected in NIH3T3 cells incubated with Trop2Fab-DOX
(Figure 3D).

and PBS exhibited modest or no inhibitory effects on
NIH3T3 cells, although DOX still exerted an inhibitory
ability (Figure 5A, 5B and 5C). For wound healing assay,
the migration rate of BxPc3 cells and PL45 cells were
decreased to 28.62% and 34.75% after incubation with
10 μg/mL of Trop2Fab-DOX for 72 h. Trop2Fab-DOX
also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on
cell migration. For NIH3T3 cells, the wound closure rates
in Trop2Fab-DOX, Trop2Fab, unrelated Fab, and PBS
showed no significant difference (Figure 5D, 5E and 5F).
We also compared the IC50 of Trop2Fab-DOX and DOX
indifferent PC cell lines. The fluorescence intensity of
Trop2 was detected by FACS analysis to represent Trop2
expression levels of PC cells. As is shown in Table  3,
according the concentration of effective-DOX, the ratio
of IC50 (Trop2Fab-DOX) to IC50 (DOX) was 4.92 in
BxPc3 cells with high Trop2 expression (98.12%) while
about 4.43 in PL45 cells with moderate Trop2 expression
(73.65%). For NIH3T3 cells, the ratio of IC50 can not
be calculated because Trop2Fab-DOX barely showed
inhibitory effects. The results indicated that the inhibitory
effects of Trop2Fab-DOX are immunological specific in
PC cells which have high Trop2 expression.

treated with Trop2Fab-DOX, while the red fluorescence
remained stable in the nuclei of BxPc3 cells treated
with DOX. In contrast, NIH3T3 cells only exhibited red
fluorescence in the nuclei when treated with DOX, while
no staining was observed when treated with Trop2FabDOX (Figure 4).

Trop2Fab-DOX inhibits tumor growth in vitro
MTT assay and wound healing assay were
performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of Trop2FabDOX in Trop2-expressing PC cells. There were significant
differences in inhibitory rate and migration rate of PC
cells between Trop2Fab-DOX group and Trop2Fab group
(p < 0.05) or PBS group (p < 0.05). For MTT assay, at
10 μg/mL of Trop2Fab-DOX after 72 h incubation, the
growth of BxPc3 cells and PL45 cells were inhibited
by 87.63% and 73.78%, respectively. Trop2Fab-DOX
showed a potent and dose-dependent inhibitory effect
on both PC cells and it also demonstrated more powerful
tumor-inhibitory ability than DOX in BxPc3 cells. In

enhance antitumor activity, reduce systemic toxicity and
bring clinical benefits [25, 26]. The key factors for ADC
development mainly include the selection of specific
antigen, optimization of the kinetics, and efficacy of
ADCs [27].
Trop2 has been identified as an oncogene for
several human cancers [28–30] and a number of strategies
targeting Trop2 have gained promising achievements
[13, 31, 32]. What Trop2 functions in PC and whether
the application of Trop2Fab in PC treatment is beneficial
deserves further exploration.
We first observed a significantly higher level of
Trop2 expression in PC tissues than in non-cancerous
tissues by qPCR test and IHC analysis. Also Trop2
expression was identified to be closely correlated with
certain malignant behaviors of PC patients. Further
survival analysis demonstrated that the prognosis of PC

Discussion
Although various therapeutic mono-clonal
antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully applied in
clinical practice, free antibodies targeting cell surface
antigens that are expressed on tumors become less
therapeutically effective by themselves or even though
in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs [23, 24].
A wealth of evidence supports the claim that ADCs can

patients with high Trop2 expression was critically worse
than that of patients with low or no expression. Collective
data on basis of previous research and the present study
supported the notion of Trop2 as a appealing therapeutic
target against cancer [13, 14, 28–30].
We previously stated that only high concentration
of Trop2Fab can exert a tumor inhibitory effect [16],
which clearly restricted its application. It was noted that
RS7 antibody could rapidly internalize into target cells
but barely had therapeutic activity in unconjugated form
[33–35]. Echoing from this inspiration, we followed
the rationale of ADCs and successfully constructed a
conjugate of Trop2Fab-DOX, which can presumably
improve the anti-tumor activity of Trop2Fab.
For ADCs, the linker is critical for maintaining
the stability of the ADCs and releasing active drug in
appropriate time and site [36, 37]. Trop2Fab-DOX is
constructed by chemical synthesis, which contains an
amide bond that is relatively stable in pH 7.2 PBS, while
is able to release drug at pH 4.2. The data of DoX release
test implies that this Trop2Fab-DOX does not release
drug in human plasma under neutral pH environment, but

allows DOX to be released from the antibody vector after
pH change. Moreover, as evaluated by cell ELISA and
immunofluorescence assay, the Trop2Fab-DOX conjugate
could maintain the ability of recognizing Trop2 protein in
cell membrane. Moreover, this conjugate had a particular
way of releasing DOX. The observation of the process
of drug transport in BxPc3 cells rendered us to quickly
detect positive signals in nuclei only after cells incubated
with DOX, and the reason may be that free DOX was
delivered into cells by a passive diffusion style and bound
to cell nucleus rapidly and stably from the beginning, and
such binding barely changed regardless of elongation
of incubation time. While as time went on, metabolic
fluorescence was distributed on the surface, cytoplasm
and nuclei of BxPc3 cells treated with Trop2Fab-DOX,
implying the equilibrious transportation of DOX in
BxPc3 cells. Meanwhile, the active DOX released from
the conjugate and partitioned to the nuclei of BxPc3 cells
was lower than the free DOX. Contrastingly, there was
no detectable fluorescence in NIH3T3 cells treated with
Trop2Fab-DOX, while high fluorescence in nucleus was
observed in NIH3T3 cells treated with free DOX. These

findings collectively suggest that DOX was rarely released
from Trop2Fab-DOX conjugate in non-Trop2 expressing
cells, which further proved the high selectivity and great
specificity of Trop2Fab-DOX.
Although an anti-Trop-2 IgG-SN-38 conjugate was
verified by Cardillo et al to exert an antitumor effect [38],
the use of the IgG antibody could not optimally recognize
tumor marker since the existence of Fc fragments. In
contrast, Fab antibody could reduce the false signals
stemming from IgG antibody and improve the capability

for identifying tumor antigen, such as Trop2 [39].
Moreover, Fab can facilitate trafficking of the antigens
across cell membrane, rendering it more suitable to
construct ADCs [40]. A recent study reported that a TriFab bispecific antibody TF12 was sufficiently retained on
cancer cell surface, which made it suitable for pre-targeted
imaging and therapy of Trop2 expressing cancers [41].
In following tumor-inhibitory experiments in vitro,
our results of MTT assay and wound healing assay
demonstrated that Trop2Fab-DOX can effectively inhibit

Figure 4: Detection of drug transport route by fluorescence microscopy. BxPC3 and NIH3T3 cells were incubated with
Trop2Fab-DOX and free DOX for 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h, respectively. For BxPC3 cells, the Trop2Fab-DOX was gradually distributed, and
with prolonged time, the signal of Trop2Fab-DOX can be observed in the membrane, cytoplasm, perinuclear area and nucleus. In contrast,
red fluorescent signals were quickly detected in the nuclei of cells after incubation with free DOX and the signals barely changed with
prolonged time. For NIH3T3 cells, no red fluorescent signal was observed when incubated with Trop2Fab-DOX.

proliferation and migration of PC cells. Also, we assessed
the antitumor effect of Trop2Fab-DOX in vivo. Although
DOX was potent to inhibit tumor growth, its efficacy
was lower than that of Trop2Fab-DOX in BxPc3 cells,
suggesting the superiority of Trop2Fab-mediated specific
tumor targeting. In addition, Trop2Fab-DOX exerted the
highest tumor inhibition rate in PC xenograft mice and
no animal death occurred in Trop2Fab-DOX treatment
group. In comparison, there were three deaths in DOX
treatment group. On this basis, it is reasonable to speculate
that the lethal toxicity of DOX was reduced due to ADC
conjugation.
It is also worth mentioning that the diversity of
Trop2 expression in human cancers. For example, Trop2
expression was exclusively localized to the membrane
in ovarian cancer cells while stroma cells were regularly
negative [30]. In comparison, Trop2 expression could be
observed in both cancer cells and stroma cells in colorectal
cancer [42]. As for PC, Fong et al. detected homogeneous
membranous expression of Trop2 in cancer cells [43].
While in this present study, Trop2 expression was observed
in both cytoplasm and stroma of PC cells. Hence despite the
promising results presented here, it should be stressed that
the different levels of Trop2 expressing in PC may result in
differential biologic efficacies of Trop2Fab-DOX.
In summary, our findings herein provide convincing
evidence that Trop2 is a specific marker for PC, and
a novel Trop2Fab-DOX ADC has a potent antitumor
activity. Moreover, this Trop2Fab-DOX is effective both
in vitro and in vivo against PC, and might serve as a
promising target for cancer therapy that merits thorough
preclinical researches in the future.

Cell lines and reagents
Two pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (BxPC3
and PL45) and a mouse fibroblast cell line NIT3T3 were
purchased from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of
Sciences (Shanghai, China). BxPC3 and PL45 are two
Trop2-positive cell lines [44] and NIH3T3 is a Trop2negative cell line. All cell lines were cultured in DMEM-H
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), penicillin (100 U/mL)
and streptomycin (100 lg/mL). Human anti-Trop2 Fab
antibody (Trop2Fab) and a self-made anti-rabies virus Fab
antibody (unrelated Fab) were prepared in our laboratory.
The commercial anti-Trop2 antibody for IHC analysis in
TMA was purchased from the Abcam Co., Ltd (Abcam,
England). Doxorubicin (DOX) (2 mg/mL) was kindly
provided by the Southeast University.

Detection of Trop2 expression by qPCR and IHC
analyses
For one-step quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test,
the primers for Trop2 were as follows: forward: 5′TAT TAC CTG GAC GAG ATT CCC C-3′ and reverse:
5′- CCC CGA CTT TCT CCG GTT G-3′. Glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an
internal control. The primers for GAPDH were as follows:
forward: 5′-TGC ACC ACC AAC TGC TTA GC-3′ and
reverse: 5′-CTC ATG ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC-3′. Total
RNA extraction, amplification conditions and one-step
qPCR procedure were described in detail in our previous
reports [45–47]. For IHC analysis, TMA sections were
incubated with a primary monoclonal mouse anti-Trop2antibody (1:200, Abcam). The IHC evaluation of Trop2
was defined in our previous reports [48–54].

Materials and methods
PC tissue samples
Ten fresh PC tissues and the corresponding
adjacent noncancerous tissues were obtained from the
Department of Pathology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital
of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital.
Simultaneously, 189 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PC
tissues and 87 non-cancerous tissues were obtained from
patients undergoing surgical therapy for PC at the Affiliated
Hospital of Nantong University between 2003 and 2010.
Clinical data were collected from patient medical records.
Tissue microarray (TMA) chips were generated using the
manual Tissue Microarrayer System Quick Ray (UT06
UNITMA, Korea) in the Department of Pathology, the
Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University. Survival time
was calculated from the date of surgery to the date of death
or last follow-up, whichever came first. Written informed
consent was provided by all participants before participation
in this study. All study protocols were reviewed and
approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of

FACS analysis and immunofluorescence assay
for Trop2Fab
Both fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis and immunofluorescence assay were carried out
on BxPC3, PL45, and NIH3T3 cell lines according to the
methods that described in our previous researches [16, 22].

Conjugation of Trop2Fab with DOX
As shown in Figure 7, MAL-PEG-COOH was
dissolved in dichloromethane to react with DOX under
the activation by DCC/NHS to form the MAL-PEGDOX. Then MAL-PEG-DOX was added to the solution
of Trop2Fab and TCEP in PBS, stirred at 37°C for 2 h to
construct Trop2 Fab-DOX.

addition of 50 μL Trop2Fab-DOX and Trop2Fab with
the same gradient effective-antibody concentrations from
0.625 to 10 μg/mL in triplicate wells. Then a goat antihuman Fab coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
antibody was added (1:2000). After washing, observation
was executed with TMB solution at room temperature for
30 min and stopped by 1 M H2SO4. The optical absorbance
was measured at 450 nm. For immunofluorescence assay,
BxPC3 and PL45 cell lines were cultured in 6-well plates
and immunofluorescence assay was performed according
to the method described previously [16]. The unrelated
Fab was used as a negative control in both assays.

The release rate of DOX from Trop2 Fab-DOX
was detected by a spectrophotometer. Briefly, the Trop2
Fab-DOX was suspended in 1 mL of PBS in a filter
bag, which was then placed in 300 mL medium of PBS
(pH 7.2 or pH 4.0) and shaken in an orbital shaker at 37°C.
The 1 mL medium was acquired and sampled for DOX
concentration, and further analyzed for the accumulated
release rate of DOX from Trop2 Fab-DOX.

performed to identify the risk factors responsible for
overall survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used
to evaluate the association between Trop2 expression
and clinical outcomes in patients with PC. Quantitative

Four-week-old BALB/c nude mice with a body
weight of 18–20 g were purchased from the SLAC
Laboratory Animal (Shanghai, China), and they were
kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. For BxPC3
xenograft establishment, all mice were injected with
5 × 106/mL BxPC3 cells subcutaneously in a volume of
0.1 mL into the flank. When tumors reached 100 mm3
after inoculation, the mice were randomly and evenly
assigned to five groups (8 mice per group). Each mouse
was injected intravenously on every two days with
different drugs: group I: high concentration of DOX
(2 mg/kg); group II: low concentration of DOX (1 mg/
kg); group III: Trop2Fab-DOX (containing 2 mg/kg of
equivalent DOX); group IV: Trop2Fab (6.52 mg/kg, the
same antibody concentration as Trop2Fab-DOX); group V:
PBS as a negative control. After xenograft transplantation,
mice bearing tumors were observed and tumor size was
measured and recorded once every 2–3 days. Tumor
volume was estimated according to the method described
previously [16]. At the end of the treatment period (30th
day), all mice were killed, and tumors were excised to
determine tumor weight and perform IHC analysis. The
animal studies were conducted in accordance with the
Public Health Service Policy and approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University.
