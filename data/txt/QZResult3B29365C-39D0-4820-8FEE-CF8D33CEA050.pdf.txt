ABSTRACT
Targeting reprogrammed energy metabolism such as aerobic glycolysis is
a potential strategy for cancer treatment. However, tumors exhibiting low-rate
glycolysis or metabolic heterogeneity might be resistant to such treatment. We
hypothesized that a therapeutic modality that drove cancer cells to high-rate
glycolysis might sensitize cancer cells to interference directed against metabolic
flux. In this study, we found that attenuated oncolytic measles virus Edmonston
strain (MV-Edm) caused glioblastoma cells to shift to high-rate aerobic glycolysis; this
adaptation was blocked by dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of glycolysis, leading
to profound cell death of cancer cells but not of normal cells. DCA enhanced viral
replication by mitigating mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated
innate immune responses. In a subcutaneous glioblastoma (GBM) xenograft mouse
model, low-dose MV-Edm and DCA significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We
found that DCA impaired glycolysis (blocking bioenergetic generation) and enhanced
viral replication (increasing bioenergetic consumption), which, in combination,
accelerated bioenergetic exhaustion leading to necrotic cell death. Taken together,
oncolytic MV-Edm sensitized cancer cells to DCA, and in parallel, DCA promoted viral
replication, thus, improving oncolysis. This novel therapeutic approach should be
readily incorporated into clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

converted to lactic acid instead of entering the citric acid
(TCA) cycle [2, 3]. Efforts have been made to target
reprogrammed metabolism alone or in combination with
cancer chemotherapy both in preclinical and clinical
studies [3].
The orphan drug dichloroacetate (DCA) is
a pyruvate mimetic. DCA has been used to treat
human hereditary mitochondrial metabolic diseases
and lactic acidosis for more than 30 years [4, 5]. It
specifically inhibits the kinase family member pyruvate

Metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a key
hallmark of cancer [1]. To provide sufficient bioenergetic
and biosynthetic intermediates to support rapid cell
growth and proliferation, cancer cells alter their metabolic
flux distinct from the surrounding tissue. A well-known
phenomenon observed in most cancer cells is a shift,
regardless of oxygen supply, to aerobic glycolysis,
termed “Warburg effect”, in which pyruvate is directly

dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) leading to reactivation of
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a key enzyme that shifts
the flux of pyruvate into mitochondria to promote glucose
oxidation instead of glycolysis [6]. DCA has been recently
evaluated in several pre-clinical cancer therapies including
prostate [7], endometrial [8], colon [9, 10], breast
cancer [11], lung cancer [12], and in a clinical study for
glioblastoma [13]. In the latter study, DCA was shown to
depolarize mitochondria, increase mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species, and induce apoptosis in glioblastoma
(GBM) cells, as well as in putative GBM stem cells. A
recent study shows that the antitumor activity of DCA
is correlated with glycolytic bias [14]. It is speculated
that DCA holds promise against most cancers with high
glycolysis-dependency.
However, cancer cells within the same tumor are
intrinsically heterogeneous due to variable blood supply,
oxygenation status, tissue pH, etc [15]. Metabolic bias has
also been identified in glioblastoma [16-18]. Metabolic
heterogeneity within a tumor mass, i.e., cells exhibiting
differential glycolysis-dependency, may contribute to
variable responses to therapies directed against glycolysis.
For instance, glioma cells with a glycolysis-dependent
phenotype displayed low tolerance to glucose starvation,
whereas glioma cells with an oxidative phosphorylationdependent phenotype exhibited prolonged survival under
glucose starvation [17].
Viral replication is dependent on the host cellular
metabolism for biomaterials and bioenergetics. As well,
viral infection alters cellular metabolism to facilitate viral
reproduction [19, 20]. An increased rate of glycolysis has
been observed in cells following infection by any number
of viruses including influenza virus [21], feline leukemia
virus [22], Rous sarcoma virus [23], Avian Sarcoma
Viruses [24], Rubella-virus [25], cytomegalovirus [26,
27], Mayaro virus [28], Newcastle disease virus [29],
and poliomyelitis virus [30]. This raises the possibility
that oncolytic viruses could be employed to propel or
synchronize cellular metabolism of cancer cells to highrate glycolysis.
Replicating oncolytic viruses are emerging as
a promising modality for the treatment of malignant
gliomas and other malignancies. Attenuated measles
virus Edmonston strain (MV-Edm) has exhibited
potent oncolytic activity in some preclinical studies
against human lymphoma [31], multiple myeloma [32],
ovarian cancer [33, 34], malignant glioma [35, 36], and
ﬁbrosarcoma [37]. Due to its oncolytic efficacy and
excellent safety record, this oncolytic measles virus
has been evaluated for treatment of cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma [38], and is now being tested in several phase
I/II clinical studies [39].
The role of MV-Edm in altering host metabolism
is unclear. Given that cancers with high dependency on
glycolysis are more sensitive to DCA, we hypothesized
that a therapeutic modality employing an oncolytic virus
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to drive cancer cells to a high glycolysis-dependent
phenotype might sensitize the tumor to DCA. In this
study, we have investigated the metabolic adaptation of
GBM cells to MV-Edm infection and the consequence
of subsequent DCA treatment in vitro and in a mouse
xenograft GBM tumor model. We found an improved
antitumor effect at a relatively low infectious dose of virus
in combination with DCA.

RESULTS
MV-Edm infection shifts cellular metabolism to
a high-rate glycolytic adaptation in glioma cells
As little is known about the metabolic alterations
to MV-Edm infection in cancer cells, we first determined
the glycolytic adaptation to viral infection in glioma cell
lines U251 and U87. We found that glucose uptake in
MV-Edm infected cells was rapidly upregulated (6 h postinfection), and increased 15% to 20% (18 h post-infection)
compared to uninfected GBM cells (Figure 1A). The
increased glucose uptake following MV-Edm infection
could be contributed by either increased aerobic glycolysis
or glucose oxidation by TCA cycles in mitochondria. To
discriminate between these possibilities, we monitored the
generation of lactate, a product normally generated from
pyruvate under hypoxic conditions, but when it occurs
under normoxic conditions is known as aerobic glycolysis.
We found that lactate release was rapidly increased in
cancer cells even at 6 h after MV-Edm infection under
normoxia (Figure 1B). Consistently, the expression of
LDHA mRNA, which encodes a key enzyme that converts
pyruvate to lactate, was significantly upregulated in MVEdm infected GBM cells (Figure 1C). Correspondingly,
ATP generation in MV-Edm infected cells was transiently
increased at early time points, e.g., 6 h post-infection
(Figure 1D), indicating that cells entered into high-rate
energy generation. Together, these results suggest that
MV-Edm infection shifted cellular metabolism to high-rate
aerobic glycolysis.

DCA blocks glycolytic adaptation to MV-Edm in
GBM cells
Previous studies have confirmed that DCA inhibits
the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. We wanted to
determine if DCA blocked MV-Edm induced highrate aerobic glycolysis. We first confirmed that DCA
efficiently inhibited aerobic glycolysis in GBM cells,
which was evidenced by decreased glucose uptake
(Figure 2A), reduced lactate production (Figure 2B), and
reduced ATP generation (Figure 2C) under normoxia. We
further found that glucose uptake (Figure 2D) and lactate
production (Figure 2E) and ATP generation (Figure 2F)

found that the viral particles in the supernatant were also
increased (Figure 3A right panel). As type-I interferons
play key roles in controlling viral replication, we evaluated
the expression of IFNB1/IFN-β and CXCL10/IP-10, an
interferon inducible protein. We found that mRNA levels
of both IFNB1 and CXCL10 were significantly decreased
in MV-Edm/DCA treated GBM cells (Figure 3B). We
further confirmed that the decrease in IFNB1 mRNA
expression correlated with decreased protein levels as
determined by ELISA. IFN-β production was decreased
in a dose-dependent manner after MV-Edm infection
of DCA treated cells (Figure 3C). Moreover, we found
that mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS),
a key adaptor protein in signaling during the anti-viral
innate immune response, and its downstream target,
phosphorylated IRF3, were dramatically decreased in
GBM cells treated with MV-Edm/DCA (Figure 3D). We

if this effect compromised viral replication. To our

following intravenous injection of a genetically modified
MV-Edm expressing a luciferase gene (MV-Edm-Luc) in
U87 glioma-bearing mice. The mean luciferase activity
in tumors, reflecting viral replication, was higher in mice
treated with MV-Edm/DCA than in mice treated with
MV-Edm alone (Figure 3E). Although the difference did
not reach statistical significance between the two groups
(p = 0.051), a trend of improved viral replication in vivo
was evident. Taken together, the data suggest that DCA
promotes MV-Edm replication by disrupting MAVSmediated anti-viral immune responses.

replication, we next investigated the antitumor activity
of MV-Edm/DCA in GBM. In vitro, enhanced antitumor
effects were achieved by combining low-dose MV-Edm
(MOI = 0.2) with DCA at a concentration of 5 mM (Figure
4A). Importantly, we found that MV-Edm/DCA treatment
had only minimal effects on the viability of the normal
human endothelial cell line ECV304 (Figure 4B). Next,
we wanted to know if low-dose MV-Edm combined
with DCA could contribute to an improved therapeutic
outcome in vivo. We established a GBM xenograft model
by subcutaneous inoculation of U87 cells into Balb/c
nude mice. First, we confirmed that MV-Edm infection
produced a significant inhibition of tumor growth (Figure
4C). Then, employing a lower infectious dose of MV-Edm
(total dose, 3.2 × 106 PFU per mouse) we found that DCA
combined with low-dose MV-Edm significantly inhibited
tumor growth, whereas only marginal tumor inhibition was
observed in mice receiving either DCA or low-dose MVEdm single treatment (Figure 4D). The dosage of DCA

groups (Figure 4E). These data show that DCA with lowdose MV-Edm improves therapeutic outcome.

of rapid energy generation) and that DCA promoted
viral replication (promotion of energy consumption),
we speculated that MV-Edm/DCA treatment might
accelerate bioenergetic exhaustion. Having shown that
ATP generation was transiently increased due to high-rate
glycolytic adaptation upon MV-Edm infection (Figure
1D), we assessed cellular ATP levels at later timepoints.
We found that ATP levels were significantly decreased
along with viral replication 36 and 48 h after MV-Edm
infection (Figure 5B). We found that ATP levels were
dramatically decreased in MV-Edm/DCA treated GBM
cells compared to cells with single treatment (Figure
5C). An energy crisis in cells treated with MV-Edm/
DCA was further indicated by a massive increase in the
level of pAMPK (Figure 5C), an energy sensor triggered
by insufficient ATP supply. These data suggest that
an accelerated bioenergetic shortage may dominantly
contribute to the enhanced antitumor effect. In view

Finally, we sought to clarify the mechanism
underlying enhanced antitumor activity of MV-Edm/DCA.
Since apoptosis has been suggested as the mechanism of
cell death induced by DCA or MV-Edm in glioma [13,
37], we investigated the contribution of apoptosis to
the combined antitumor effect. We found that z-VADfmk, a pan caspase inhibitor, failed to inhibit MV-Edm/
DCA induced cell death (Figure 5A). Given that DCA
blocked glycolytic adaptation to MV-Edm (impairment

of the fact that a cellular ATP shortage mainly leads to
necrosis, and the fact that the high mobility group box1
(HMGB1) has been identified as a danger signal released
from necrotic cells that can be used as a necrotic marker
[40], we evaluated the HMGB1 level in the cytoplasm and
supernatant of MV-Edm/DCA treated cells. We found that
the HMGB1 level was increased in the supernatant and in
parallel was decreased in the cytoplasm of MV-Edm/DCA
treated GBM cells (Figure 5D), which confirmed necrotic
cell death. These data imply that MV-Edm/DCA induces a
severe bioenergetic crisis in GBM cells leading to necrotic
cell death.

death. Second, DCA promoted viral replication in GBM,
which would enhance its oncolytic effect. The enhanced
viral replication in MV-Edm/DCA treated cells is likely
the consequence of impaired innate immune responses
mediated by MAVS, a key adaptor protein in antiviral
signaling [41]. The MAVS protein level was markedly
decreased in GBM cells, suggesting that MV-Edm/DCA
treatment enhanced MAVS degradation. However, the
precise mechanism is unknown in our setting and needs
further study. It has been reported that mitochondrial
membrane potential (Δψm) is required for MAVSmediated anti-viral signaling [42], and that DCA reduces
Δψm via remodeling mitochondria [43]. It is possible that
reduced Δψm (data not shown) might partially contribute
to impaired MAVS signaling. The enhanced viral
replication induced by DCA makes this strategy attractive,
as viral replication is crucial for improving MV-Edmmediated oncolysis. Thus, the combinational modality
of MV-Edm/DCA represents an efficient and practical
strategy for clinical oncolytic virotherapy.
The enhanced cell death was a result of necrosis
rather than apoptosis. In MV-Edm/DCA treated cells, cell
viability could not be rescued by the pan caspase inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk. Previous studies show that ATP exhaustion
predominantly leads to necrosis [44]. We confirmed that
the necrosis was a consequence of a severe bioenergetics
crisis, as MV-Edm/DCA treatment dramatically decreased
ATP generation. Necrotic cell death was directly
confirmed by finding increased levels of HMGB1 in the
supernatant of MV-Edm/DCA treated cells, which was
accompanied by a parallel decrease in HMGB1 expression
in the cytoplasm.
The bioenergetic exhaustion in MV-Edm/
DCA treated GBM cells was the consequence of two
synchronous factors: enhanced bioenergetics consumption
and impaired bioenergetics generation. On the one hand,
despite the rapid increase in ATP generation upon MVEdm infection at early time points due to the cellular
glycolytic adaptation, the ATP level was decreased along
with viral replication 36 h post-infection due to massive
bioenergetics consumption. Moreover, DCA promoted
viral replication, and thus, accelerated ATP exhaustion
in MV-Edm/DCA treated cells. On the other hand,
DCA blocked aerobic glycolytic adaptation to MV-Edm
infection, which further exacerbated the bioenergetics
crisis. It is also plausible that the improved viral replication
might facilitate viral spread to neighboring non-infected
cells, which in turn, would sensitize more GBM cells to
DCA mediated inhibition of glycolysis, a vicious cycle
ultimately leading to enhanced antitumor activity.
It is important to note that no obvious side-effects
were observed in treated mice. The safety of this strategy
was also confirmed by our observation in vitro that
normal human endothelial cells are resistant to MV-Edm/
DCA treatment. Possible explanations might be that MVEdm is non-toxic or mildly-toxic to normal cells and that

DISCUSSION
We hypothesized that an intervention modality that
initially drove cancer cells to high glycolysis-dependency
followed by a treatment directed against glycolysis might
improve the antitumor effect. In this study, we found that
the self-replicating MV-Edm shifts cellular metabolism to
a high-rate glycolytic adaptation, which can be efficiently
targeted by DCA, leading to improved antitumor activity
both in vitro and in a tumor-bearing mouse model. We
did not observe any toxicity. Our data indicated that
DCA promoted MV-Edm replication by impairing the
MAVS-mediated anti-viral innate immune response. The
therapeutic approach of combining DCA with low-dose
MV-Edm produced an enhanced antitumor effect that
resulted in dominant necrotic cell death due to a severe
shortage of cellular ATP in GBM cells. Given that both
MV-Edm and DCA have been effectively tested in clinical
studies, this novel strategy could be readily moved from
bench to bedside.
MV-Edm infection upregulates glycolysis under
aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect) in glioblastoma
cells, which was evidenced by increased glucose uptake,
lactate production, and LDHA expression upon MVEdm infection. We observed a rapid increase in ATP
generation suggesting that cancer cells were shifted to a
high-rate glycolytic adaptation. Similar to other viruses
that upregulate glycolysis [33-42], the metabolic shift
toward glycolysis presumably favors both viral replication
and host cell survival. It is thought that viruses mobilize
glycolysis of infected cells to provide sufficient nutrients
and energy for viral replication, and infected cells shift
to high-rate glycolysis for rapid generation of ATP to
compensate for the “robbed bioenergetics”.
We found that DCA significantly improved
oncolysis of low-dose MV-Edm both in vitro and in vivo.
The improved antitumor effect was achieved through two
distinct effects. First, DCA successfully blocked glycolytic
adaptation to MV-Edm infection. Given that the antitumor
activity of DCA is likely to be enhanced in cancer cells
with more glycolysis-dependency [14], the conversion to
high-rate glycolysis mediated by MV-Edm infection would
make GBM cells more vulnerable to DCA induced cell

under normoxic conditions normal cells shunt glycolytic
pyruvate into the TCA cycle rather than conversion to
lactate. These advantages may provide a wide therapeuticwindow for a MV-Edm/DCA treatment modality.
Several oncolytic viruses have been shown to
elicit anti-tumor immune responses [38, 45-47]. As
well, DCA is able to enhance antitumor immunity [48].
Thus, it would be interesting to determine whether MVEdm/DCA treatment elicits a more profound antitumor
immunity. Because our in vivo study was conducted in
immunocompromised mice bearing human GBM cells
(as measles virus only infects primates or humans),
immunologic reactions could not be reliably assessed.
Further studies using immunocompetent mice, e.g.,
CD46 transgenic mice, may permit a comprehensive
analysis. Of note, recent studies have shown that lactate
may compromise anti-tumor immune responses [49, 50],
and we showed that DCA significantly decreased lactate
production in cancer cells infected with MV-Edm. Thus,
MV-Edm/DCA modality might contribute to amplify the
anti-tumor immune responses by reducing tumor lactate
production, which deserves further intensive investigation.
It has been shown recently that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
decreases lactate production in cancer cell lines regardless
of normoxia or hypoxia [51, 52], which may also extend
our further anticancer investigation to target aerobic
glycolytic adaptation to oncolytic viruses by mTOR
inhibitors.
In summary, our work provides a novel, clinically
relevant, therapeutic strategy that provides a rationale for
combining oncolytic virotherapy with a treatment modality
targeting reprogrammed cancer cell metabolism. The
strategy is based on two promising antitumor strategies,
both of which have been tested in clinical studies, and
which can be readily translated to clinical cancer therapy.

To determine glucose uptake, glucose concentration
in culture supernatants was determined using a glucose
assay kit (Shanghai Rongsheng Biotech, Shanghai, China,
F006) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and
quantified by absorption at 450 nm. Lactate generation
was measured using a lactate assay kit according to
the manufacturer’s instruction (Nanjing Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China, A019-2). Briefly,
NAD+ is added to the media and is converted to NADH
stoichiometrically by lactate in the medium. The levels of
NADH were quantified colorimetrically at 530 nm.

ATP detection
Intracellular ATP was measured by a luciferinluciferase method using with an ATP assay kit (Beyotime
Inst. Biotech, Jiangsu, China, S0026). In brief, cells were
washed once with PBS and transferred to lysis buffer. The
supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 12000 g
for 10 min at 4°C, and mixed with ATP detection buffer
and analyzed by luminescence spectrometry. The final
ATP content of each sample was normalized to protein
concentration measured by BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Beyotime Inst. Biotech, Jiangsu, China, P0012).

Virus titration
MV-Edm and MV-Edm expressing a reporter gene
luciferase (MV-Edm-luc, kindly provided by S. Russell,
Mayo Clinic, MN, USA) were propagated in Vero cells
following infection at an MOI of 0.02 in 2 ml OptiMEM
(Invitrogen, 31985-062) at 37°C for 3 h. The medium was
changed to DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and cells
were incubated at 37°C for 1 day before being transferred
to 32°C for another day. Cells were harvested, and viral
particles were released by two cycles of snap freezing
in liquid nitrogen and thawing in 37°C water bath. Or
the supernatant from glioma cells infected with MVEdm in the presence or absence of DCA were harvested,
centrifuged, and stored at -80°C until used. Viral titers
were determined by 50% end-point dilution assays
(TCID50) on Vero cells.

and human ECV304 endothelial cells and Vero cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/l penicillin and 0.1
mg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany). Cultures were maintained in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Dichloroacetate (DCA),
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and z-VAD-fmk were all
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany).

Cell viability assay
Cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA solution
and stained with trypan blue. Viability was then
determined by trypan blue exclusion using a Countstar
Automated cell counter (Inno-Alliance Biotech Inc.,
Wilmington, USA).

Glucose uptake and lactate release assay
Supernatants were harvested from cultured U251
and U87 cells at various time points after treatment.

Supernatants from treated or untreated cells
were harvested, centrifuged, and stored at -80°C until
used. Samples were analyzed using an ELISA assay for
detection of IFNB1/IFN-ß (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, 41410-1A) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Visualization of MV-Edm replication in vivo

Quantitative RT-PCR

Male Balb/c nude mice (6-8 week old) were
injected subcutaneously with 1×106 U87 cells in the left
flanks and randomized to 2 groups. When tumors reached
palpable size, one group of mice was treated for 10 days
with DCA (70 mg/L in drinking water). Both groups of
mice then received 4 × 105 PFU MV-Edm-Luc via tail
vein injection. Three days after MV-Edm injection, mice
were anesthetized and injected intraperitoneally with
D-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) and
subjected to luciferase assay using the IVIS Lumina XR
system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). The
level of firefly luciferase was expressed as the ROI value
normalized to tumor volume.

For
quantitative
RT-PCR
(qPCR),
total  cellular  RNA  was  extracted  with  TRIZOL
(Invitrogen, 15596-026) and 1 µg of RNA was reversetranscribed using the Master Mix Perfect Real Time kit
(TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan, DRR036A) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR was performed using the
Real-Time PCR system (ABI 7300, Advanced Biosystems,
Foster, CA). Gene expression was calculated with the
comparative Ct method and normalized to the endogenous
levels of GAPDH. Primer sequences used for qPCR were:
CXCL10,

In vivo treatment with high-dose MV-Edm
Male Balb/c nude mice (6-8 week old) were injected
subcutaneously with 1×106 U87 cells in the left flanks on
day 0 and randomized to 2 groups (n = 8 per group). Mice
received 8×105 PFU MV-Edm via tail vein injection every
other day from day 10 to 18 and day 25 to 39. Total dose of
MV-Edm for each mouse was 1×107 PFU. Untreated mice
were used as negative controls. Tumors were measured
every 3 days, and tumor volume was calculated as length
x width2/2.

Western blot

In vivo treatment by combining DCA with lowdose MV-Edm

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany,
11873580001). Protein concentration was determined.
Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDSPAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto a PVDF
membrane (Roche, 03010040001). After blocking
with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween-20, the membrane was incubated with
specific primary antibodies, followed by incubation
with appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies. Signals were developed using
an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany, WBKLS0500) and captured on
an Alpha Innotech Fluor Chem FC2 imaging system
(Alpha Innotech, San Leanardo, CA). Antibodies used
in this study were: rabbit anti-β-ACTIN (Biosynthesis
Biotechnology, Beijing, China, bs0061R, 1:1000), rabbit
anti-HMGB1 (Abcam, Hong Kong, China, ab191583,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Male Balb/c nude mice (6-8 week old) were injected
subcutaneously with 1×106 U87 cells in the left flanks
on day 0 and randomized to 4 groups (5 to 6 mice per
group). On day 6, two groups of mice were provided
drinking water containing DCA (70 mg/L) until the end of
the experiment. Starting 15 days after tumor inoculation,
two groups of mice treated with DCA or untreated, were
injected intravenously with 4×105 PFU MV-Edm every
3 days from day 15 to 27 and day 36 to 42. Total dose
of MV-Edm for each mouse was 3.2 x 106 PFU. Tumors
were measured every 3 days, and tumor volume was
calculated as length x width2/2. Mice exhibiting moribund
behavior were euthanized. All animal work was approved
by the Animal Care Committee of Nanjing University
in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines.
