ABSTRACT:
The transcription factor MycN is the prototypical neuroblastoma oncogene and
a potential therapeutic target. However, its strong expression caused by gene
amplification in about 30% of neuroblastoma patients is a considerable obstacle to
the development of therapeutic approaches aiming at eliminating its tumourigenic
activity. We have previously reported that B-Myb is essentially required for
transcription of the MYCN amplicon and have also shown that B-MYB and MYCN are
engaged in a feed forward loop promoting the survival/proliferation of neuroblastoma
cells. We postulated that pharmacological strategies breaking the B-MYB/MYCN axis
should result in clinically desirable effects. Thus, we implemented a high throughput
chemical screen, using a curated library of ~1500 compounds from the National
Cancer Institute, whose endpoint was the identification of small molecules that
inhibited B-Myb. At the end of the screening, we found that the compounds pinafide,
ellipticine and camptothecin inhibited B-Myb transcriptional activity in luciferase
assays. One of the compounds, the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor camptothecin, is of
considerable clinical interest since its derivatives topotecan and irinotecan are
currently used as first and second line treatment agents for various types of cancer,
including neuroblastoma. We found that neuroblastoma cells with amplification of
MYCN are more sensitive than MYCN negative cells to camptothecin and topotecan
killing. Campothecin and topotecan caused selective down-regulation of B-Myb and
MycN expression in neuroblastoma cells. Notably, forced overexpression of B-Myb
could antagonize the killing effect of topotecan and camptothecin, demonstrating
that the transcription factor is a key target of the drugs. These results suggest
that camptothecin and its analogues should be more effective in patients whose
tumours feature amplification of MYCN and/or overexpression of B-MYB.

INTRODUCTION

are about 700 new cases per year in the United States [1,
2].
Amplification of MYCN is the most common genetic
aberration associated with poor outcome in neuroblastoma
[3, 4], occurs in roughly 30% of primary tumours and is
strongly correlated with advanced disease and treatment
failure [5, 6]. Its association with poor outcome in
patients with otherwise favourable disease features,

Neuroblastoma is a tumour of the sympathetic
nervous system and the most common extracranial
solid tumour in childhood. It represents more than 7%
of malignancies in patients younger than 15 years and
around 15% of all paediatric oncology deaths. The overall
incidence is about one case in 7,000 live births, and there

such as localized tumours or INSS stage 4S disease,
underscores its biological importance [7-9]. The MYCN
proto-oncogene encodes a 60-63 KDa protein (MycN)
that is exclusively expressed in the developing nervous
system, unlike its paralogue c-MYC, which is expressed
ubiquitously [10]. Like all Myc family proteins, MycN
contains an N-terminal transactivating domain (MYC box)
and a C-terminal region containing a basic-helix-loophelix/leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) motif, which mediates
DNA binding as well as binding to other bHLH-LZ
proteins such as Max and Mad [11].
MYCN is located on the distal short arm of
chromosome 2 (2p24): a large region from this site
becomes amplified and the MYCN locus is copied to form
an extrachromosomal circular element, or DM (doubleminute chromatin bodies), with retention of the normal
copies of MYCN at 2p24. DMs might accumulate by
uneven segregation during mitosis; however, in some
cases, the amplified DNA integrates into a chromosomal
locus to form an HSR (homogeneously staining regions)
[12-15]. Other genes might be co-amplified with MYCN
in a subset of cases, but MYCN is the only gene that is
consistently amplified from this locus [4].
The vertebrate Mybs comprise a small family of
transcription factors. The prototypical member, c-Myb,
is the cellular homologue of the oncogene carried by
the AMV and E26 chicken retroviruses that transform
haematopoietic cells in vivo and in vitro [16]. The two
other members of the family, A-Myb and B-Myb, share

a similar protein domain organization and bind to the
same consensus sequence on the DNA [17-19]. B-MYB
is expressed early during mouse embryogenesis, and
is associated with cell proliferation. Consistent with
this, B-MYB knock-out mice die at a very early stage
of development, and the requirement for B-Myb in
inner cell mass formation is indicated by the severely
impaired proliferation of these pluripotent cells when
blastocysts were explanted and cultured in vitro [20-24].
B-MYB antisense oligonucleotides inhibit proliferation
of normal and transformed cell lines, while constitutive
B-MYB expression allows BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts to
grow in low serum conditions and prevents cell cycle
arrest and differentiation of M1 myeloid leukaemia
cells treated with interleukin (IL)-6 [25-27]. B-Myb is
a relatively weak, ubiquitous transcription factor and in
normal physiological settings it is not essential for the
transcription of MYCN, whose expression is strictly tissue
specific. However, in neuroblastoma the generation of
multiple copies of the MYCN gene causes accumulation
of the MycN oncoprotein, which binds to the B-MYB locus
and activates its unregulated expression. This will initiate
a pathological regulatory cycle where B-Myb, in spite of
its intrinsically weak transcriptional activity, will cause a
significant enhancement of MYCN expression due to the
large number of template amplicons available [28]. Given
their reliance on B-MYB, neuroblastoma tumours with
amplification of MYCN should be exquisitely sensitive
to its pharmacological targeting, suggesting that small

product set. Each chemical compound was assessed
in a high throughput assay with a neuroblastoma cell
line stably transfected with a MYB responsive promoter
linked to the luciferase gene and a B-MYB expression
vector. The aim was to find compounds that inhibited
B-Myb transcriptional activity more than 50% compared
to control. At the end of the screening, we observed that
several compounds showed various degrees of inhibitory
activity. Curiously, some compounds were activators of
B-Myb transcriptional activity, but were not investigated
further (Fig. 1). The compounds ellipticine, pinafide and
camptothecin were selected for further analysis given
their potential anticancer activity, and we confirmed

their ability to suppress B-Myb transcriptional activity
in independent transient transfection luciferase assays
(Fig. 2A). As a control, we verified that the inhibitory
effect on p53-mediated transactivation was weak,
corroborating the hypothesis that the effect of the
compounds is, at least to some extent, specific to B-Myb
(Fig. 2B). Pinafide, ellipticine and camptothecin, are plant
antibiotics with a vague structural similarity, all containing
aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms. Camptothecin and
ellipticine are known topoisomerase 1 and 2 inhibitors,
respectively. They cause DNA damage and are used as
chemotherapeutic drugs [29-32]. Two water-soluble
derivatives of camptothecin, topotecan and irinotecan,
are in use as first or second line antineoplastic agents in a
variety of cancers, including neuroblastoma [32-37].

amplified cell lines proliferated normally at these drug
concentrations (Fig. 4B). To investigate in more detail the
effect on proliferation and cell survival of camptothecin
and topotecan in neuroblastoma cells, we carried out
propidium iodide DNA staining and FACS analysis. In
agreement with the MTT assay, in the presence of the
drugs we observed a marked increase of cells blocked
in the S or G2 phase of the cell cycle and an increase
of fragmented, hypodiploid DNA, but only in cells
with MYCN amplification. In contrast, non-amplified
neuroblastoma cells showed a normal cell cycle profile
in the presence of 10-20 nM camptothecin or topotecan
(Fig. S1).  Camptothecin and its analogues inhibit
topoisomerase 1, therefore the observed effects could be
explained if topoisomerase 1 expression were higher in
MYCN-amplified, compared with MYCN non-amplified
cell lines. However, the expression of topoisomerase-1
is highly variable among the different neuroblastoma cell
lines and unrelated to the amplification status of MYCN,
suggesting that the killing effect is independent from
topoisomerase-1 expression (Fig. S2).

Biological effects of the B-Myb-inhibiting
compounds in neuroblastoma cell lines.
We used camptothecin, pinafide and ellipticine in
proliferation assays with a panel of MYCN amplified or
non-amplified cell lines. Pinafide showed some killing
activity at the highest concentrations used, i.e. 250500 nM, independently from the presence of MYCN
amplification (Fig. 3A,B). Neuroblastoma cell lines
were resistant to escalating doses of ellipticine up to
a concentration of 500nM, with the exception of SHSY5Y cells which were inhibited by high concentrations
of the drug (Fig. 3B). Notably, neuroblastoma cell lines
with amplification of MYCN were extremely sensitive
to concentrations of camptothecin or its clinical analog
topotecan as low as 10-20 nM (Fig. 4A), whereas non-

The B-MYB-MYCN axis is disrupted by
camptothecin and its clinical analogue topotecan.
B-MYB and MYCN are engaged in a feed forward
loop sustaining the expression of each other. Furthermore,
B-Myb autoregulates its own expression.[38] Thus, we
hypothesised that, by inhibiting B-Myb transcriptional
activity, camptothecin and topotecan could also disrupt
the expression of B-MYB and of its target gene, MYCN.
Indeed, we observed that expression of B-Myb and MycN

indicated. Note that cell viability is only reduced by high concentrations (250-500nM) of pinafide, in a MYCN-independent manner.

is downregulated by the drugs in 3 out of 4 MYCNamplified cell lines (Fig. 5). The effect is not a mere
consequence of reduced proliferation or cell death, since
expression of cell cycle genes, such as cyclin A and cyclin
B, or the housekeeping gene GAPDH is unaffected (Fig.
6). The increased expression of cyclin A/B by the drugs
probably reflects the high number of cells blocked at the S
and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. S1). We observed
PARP fragmentation in drug-responsive cells, diagnostic
of apoptosis (Fig. 6). Interestingly, camptothecin and
topotecan did not cause inhibition of B-Myb/MycN

expression and PARP cleavage in SK-N-BE2 cells. SK-NBE2 cells contain mutated p53 [39] and it was previously
observed that B-MYB expression is activated in cell
lines with mutation of p53, perhaps explaining the drugresistant phenotype [40].

MYCN.
Recent studies have revealed that B-Myb might
promote cell cycle progression and cell survival by coordinating the expression of G2/M genes also by recruiting
other transcription factors, such as FoxM1 [41]. B-MYB
is overexpressed and amplified in a number of cancers,
including breast, ovary, leukaemia and neuroblastoma
and we have shown that neuroblastoma cells are addicted
to B-MYB expression, but only in the context of MYCN
amplification. B-Myb physically binds to the MYCN
amplicon and is required for MycN expression. On the
other hand, MycN promotes B-Myb transcription, feeding
a positive loop that promotes survival of neuroblastoma
cells [28]. Our new study shows that camptothecin
and its clinically used derivative topotecan inhibit the
transcriptional activity of B-Myb, inducing synthetic

To demonstrate that the killing effect of camptothecin
and topotecan in MYCN-amplified cell lines is caused by
inhibition of B-Myb, we carried out a rescue experiment.
To this end, we transfected LAN-5 cells with empty or
B-MYB expression vectors. We then selected two clones
expressing high levels of B-Myb (Fig. S3) and exposed
them to 10-20nM topotecan or camptothecin. Notably, the
inhibition of cell proliferation caused by the drugs was
partially rescued by ectopic expression of B-MYB (Fig. 7).
This experiment demonstrates that B-Myb is a key target
of the drugs in neuroblastoma cells with amplification of

lethality in MYCN positive cells at dosages below
the plasma concentrations attained in cancer patients
undergoing treatment [42-44]. Thus, the molecular make
up of neuroblastoma tumours is highly relevant to the
sensitivity to camptothecin analogues. It will be interesting
to verify whether the clinical response to these drugs is
associated with the amplification status of MYCN and/or
overexpression of B-MYB in neuroblastoma patients. If
clinical studies will confirm this association, it is possible
to envisage that paediatric patients with MYCN amplified
tumours could be treated with lower dosages of the drugs,
resulting in less toxicity and fewer long lasting sequelae.

MTS assay
The CellTiter 96® AQueous Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay is a colorimetric method for
determining the number of viable cells in proliferation
or chemosensitivity assays. The CellTiter 96®
AQueous Assay is composed of solutions of a novel
tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium, inner salt; MTS) and an electron coupling
reagent (phenazine methosulfate; PMS). MTS is
bioreduced by cells into a formazan product that is soluble
in tissue culture medium. The absorbance of the formazan
at 490nm can be measured directly from 96-well assay
plates without additional processing. The conversion of
MTS into aqueous, soluble formazan is accomplished by
dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active
cells. The quantity of formazan product as measured by
the amount of 490nm absorbance is directly proportional
to the number of living cells in culture.

Chemical screen and luciferase assays
The Diversity Set II (1364 compounds) and the
Natural Product Set II (120 compounds) were obtained
from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Fisher
BioServices, Rockville, MD). GIMEN, a MYCN nonamplified neuroblastoma cell line, was stably transfected
with the pGL2-mim1 and the pcDna-B-MYB plasmids.
Stably transfected GIMEN cells were exposed to each
compound in 96 well plates for 24 h at a final concentration
of 5 uM. After 24 hours, cells were subjected to luciferase
assay and compounds causing over 50% inhibition of
B-Myb transactivation in the absence of overt toxicity
(i.e. rounding up and detachment of cells from plate) were
used in validation experiments in which naïve GIMEN
cells were exposed to the compounds after transient
transfection of the MYB reporter and B-Myb expressing
plasmids.  Luciferase assays were performed with the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA),
