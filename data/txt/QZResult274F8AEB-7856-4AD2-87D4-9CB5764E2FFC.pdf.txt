ABSTRACT
Oncolytic adenovirus and apoptosis inducer TRAIL are promising cancer
therapies. Their antitumor efficacy, when used as single agents, is limited. Oncolytic
adenoviruses have low infection activity, and cancer cells develop resistance to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we explored combining prostate-restricted replication
competent adenovirus-mediated TRAIL (PRRA-TRAIL) with lovastatin, a commonly
used cholesterol-lowering drug, as a potential therapy for advanced prostate cancer
(PCa). Lovastatin significantly enhanced the efficacy of PRRA-TRAIL by promoting
the in vivo tumor suppression, and the in vitro cell killing and apoptosis induction, via
integration of multiple molecular mechanisms. Lovastatin enhanced PRRA replication
and virus-delivered transgene expression by increasing the expression levels of
CAR and integrins, which are critical for adenovirus 5 binding and internalization.
Lovastatin enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increasing death receptor DR4
expression. These multiple effects of lovastatin on CAR, integrins and DR4 expression
were closely associated with cholesterol-depletion in lipid rafts. These studies, for
the first time, show correlations between cholesterol/lipid rafts, oncolytic adenovirus
infection efficiency and the antitumor efficacy of TRAIL at the cellular level. This
work enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that support use of
lovastatin, in combination with PRRA-TRAIL, as a candidate strategy to treat human
refractory prostate cancer in the future.

Androgen ablation remains the main treatment modality
recommended for patients with advanced disease, with
an emerging role for chemotherapy. However, hormonal
ablation is not curative. PCa inevitably progresses to an

curative therapy is available to treat PCa after it becomes

hormone refractory and metastasizes to bone. At this point,
the disease becomes fatal.
Gene therapy is one option that holds promise to
improve the targeted killing of hormone refractory PCa
cells. For example, adenovirus 5 (Ad) vectors have a broad
host range and can infect both normal and tumor cells [2,
3]. To reduce unwanted side effects, it is important to
develop oncolytic tissue and tumor-restricted, replicationcompetent adenoviral vectors (TRRA). TRRA exhibit
superior antitumor efficacy and safety when compared
to replication-deficient Ad vectors, because TRRA
actively propagates in and lyses the targeted cancer cells.
In contrast, TRRA replication activity is low in normal
cells. We developed a prostate-restricted, replication
competent adenoviral vector (PRRA) by placing both
adenoviral E1a and E4 genes under the control of a
PSES enhancer to direct viral replication in a tissue and
tumor-specific manner [4]. PSES is a chimeric prostatespecific enhancer sequence, which combines the enhancer
elements from PSA and PSMA genes, two well-studied
prostate-specific biomarkers. PSES demonstrated high
tumor specific activity in PSA/PSMA positive PCa cell
lines [5]. PRRA showed prostate-restricted replication and
killing activities in PSA/PSMA positive PCa cell lines [4].
However, the low virus infection efficiency and the limited
virus distribution in the solid tumors limit the therapeutic
potential of these oncolytic PRRAs for applications in
prostate cancer.
To improve therapeutic efficacy, we developed a
series of gene-armed PRRAs by delivering suicide gene
HSV-TK [6], apoptosis inducer TRAIL [7] and FasL [8],
angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin and angiostatin fusion
gene [9] and antitumor immune stimulator IL-12 [10].
The cancer-selective death-inducing character of TRAIL
makes it an attractive candidate molecule for cancer
therapy. TRAIL induces receptor-mediated apoptosis in a
wide variety of cancer cell lines of diverse origin. TRAIL
binding to death domain-controlled receptors, DR4 and
DR5, triggers the death-inducing signal complex (DISC)
formation and activation of procaspase-8, which in turn
activates caspase-3, leading to cell death [11]. Normal
cells can escape TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the
expression of an antagonist decoy receptor, TRID [12]. A
challenge to the in vivo use of TRAIL is that some cancer
cells are resistant to TRAIL treatment. Many molecules
in the TRAIL signaling pathway, including FLIPs, IAPs
and IG20, can contribute to resistance mechanisms [13].
This means that high concentration of TRAIL protein is
an essential prerequisite for this therapy to be viable [14].
We developed a TRAIL-expressing PRRA to improve
delivery and targeting of TRAIL to tumor sites. PRRATRAIL improved the antitumor efficacy of both PRRA
and TRAIL by activating multiple molecular mechanisms
[7]. Importantly, the PRRA-TRAIL virus-infected tumor
cells produced soluble TRAIL, which triggered apoptosis
of the surrounding cells uninfected by viruses [7].

An alternative strategy to increase tumor cell
killing is to combine pharmaceutical agents with gene
therapy. Pharmacologic agents that may be useful in
this regard are the statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
(HMG) CoA reductase inhibitors, that are commonly
used to lower cholesterol. Several large population-based
epidemiological studies suggest that lovastatin reduced
the risk of PCa [15-17]. Statins exert antitumor effects
on PCa cell lines by inhibiting cell proliferation [18],
interfering with the cell cycle [19] and inducing apoptosis
[20]. Lovastatin molecular mechanisms include increased
cytochrome c release, which reduced pro-caspase-3
and increased activated caspase-3, independently of
P53-induced apoptosis when combined with other
chemotherapeutics, lovastatin exerts a synergistic effect
to suppress tumor growth [21-23].
Here, we explored the consequences of combining
lovastatin with PRRA-mediated TRAIL in proof-ofprinciple experiments to support development of a
novel strategy to treat refractory PCa. We determined
the in vivo antitumor efficacy and extent of in vitro cell
killing and apoptosis induction of PRRA-TRAIL and
lovastatin therapy. Viral replication activity and transgene
expression were assessed. Viral binding, internalization
and intercellular trafficking were monitored after PCa cells
were pre-treated with lovastatin. The levels of cholesterol/
lipid rafts on cellular membranes were assessed. Induction
of apoptosis by either lovastatin or TRAIL alone or the
combination of treatments was evaluated. The correlation
of cancer cell apoptosis induced by lovastatin with
the level of cholesterol/lipid rafts was analyzed. The
expression of adenovirus-associated receptors CAR,
selected integrins and the death receptors, DR4 and
DR5, were assessed after lovastatin treatment. These
studies add to our understanding of the role of membrane
cholesterol in oncolytic adenovirus infection efficiency,
and in induction of apoptosis by TRAIL. In summary,
we identified key molecular mechanisms that support
use of lovastatin in combination with PRRA-TRAIL as a
candidate strategy to treat refractory PCa.

RESULTS
Lovastatin significantly enhanced in vivo
antitumor efficacy of oncolytic PRRA AdE4 and
AdE4-TRAIL
In previous work, we developed a prostaterestricted replication competent adenoviral (PRRA)
vector AdE4PSESE1a (AdE4), in which both adenoviral
E1a and E4 genes were controlled by PSES enhancer
[4]. The adenoviral vector was used to deliver a series
of therapeutic genes such as HSV-TK [6], TRAIL [7],
FasL [8] and endostatin-angiostatin fusion genes [9] by

replacing EGFP gene with therapeutic genes (Figure
1A) to improve antitumor efficacy. Here, we first tested
if lovastatin improved the in vivo antitumor efficacy of
AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL in PSA/PSMA positive, androgenindependent CWR22rv subcutaneous tumor xenografts
in nude mice. In contrast to DMSO control, lovastatin
alone, injected i.p. at 15 mg/kg/day, for 7 consecutive
days, delayed the growth of tumor xenografts. Consistent
with previous reports, AdE4 inhibited tumor growth,
but only for the first 14 days after virus injection. After
14 days, the tumors grew exponentially [4]. Lovastatin
significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of AdE4.
Average tumor size decreased by approximately 20% on
day 21, and by 40% on day 28 (P<0.01). AdE4-TRAIL
exhibited better antitumor efficacy than AdE4, due to
incorporation of TRAIL (P<0.01). Interestingly, lovastatin
greatly improved the antitumor efficacy of AdE4-TRAIL
(P<0.01), because the tumor burden remained decreased
for more than 14 days after virus injection (Figure 1B).
On day 28, gross tumor size was much less in mice treated
with lovastatin plus AdE4-TRAIL, than in those treated
with AdE4-TRAIL alone (Figure 1B).
We harvested tumor xenografts at 28 days after
cell incubation, and tested for adenovirus infection inside
tumor tissues. No significant difference in adenovirus
infection efficiency was observed between AdE4 and
AdE4-TRAIL-treated tumors. When compared to control
AdE4-infected tumors, lovastatin significantly increased
AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL viral-infection efficiency (P<0.01,
Figure 1D). We also analyzed cell apoptosis inside tumor
tissues by using an in situ fluorescent TUNEL assay.
In contrast to DMSO control, lovastatin or AdE4 alone
induced apoptosis in some cells. When combined with
AdE4, lovastatin increased cell apoptosis (P<0.01). As
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

predicted, AdE4-TRAIL induced more cell apoptosis
than AdE4, due to the added apoptosis induction effect
of TRAIL (P<0.01). Lovastatin further enhanced AdE4TRAIL-induced apoptosis (P<0.01, Figure 1E). These data
suggest that lovastatin significantly enhances the oncolytic
effect of replication competent adenoviruses, and may also
enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Lovastatin enhanced in vitro cell killing and
apoptosis induction by AdE4 and AdE4-TRAIL
in PCa cells
As lovastatin significantly enhanced in vivo
antitumor efficacy of both AdE4 and AdE4-TRAIL, we
tested if lovastatin would improve the in vitro killing
effects of AdE4 and AdE4-TRAIL in PSA/PSMApositive PCa cells. CWR22rv or C4-2 cells were treated
with either lovastatin, AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL alone, or in
combination. The doses of lovastatin and oncolytic viruses
used in the combination experiments were determined in
preliminary studies (data not shown). As shown in Figure
2A, the control construct, AdE4(∆TATA)(100 vp/cell),
did not exhibit detectable cell killing in CWR22rv cells,
because the TATA box of E1a gene was deleted and the
virus is replication-deficient (Figure 1a). Lovastatin (5
μM) alone slightly increased cell killing, when compared
to DMSO control (P<0.05). AdE4 (100 vp/cell) exhibited
some cell killing activity because of the oncolytic effect
of replication competent adenovirus. Lovastatin (5 μM)
significantly increased the cell killing activity of AdE4
(100 vp/cell) (P<0.01). Furthermore, AdE4-TRAIL
exhibited more cell killing activity than AdE4 (P<0.01).

CWR22rv xenografts were established in athymic nude mice. Mice were randomized 3 weeks after cell inoculation (8 mice/group, 1 tumor

AdE4-TRAIL (P<0.01).
Similar results were observed in C4-2 cells. The
control, AdE4(∆TATA)( 50 vp/cell), did not exhibit
detectable cell killing activity. Lovastatin (2.5 μM) alone
induced a minor level of in vitro killing. AdE4 (50 vp/
cell) alone exhibited some cell killing activity, compared
to DMSO control. Lovastatin (2.5 μM) significantly
increased cell killing activity of AdE4 (50 vp/cell)
(P<0.01). AdE4-TRAIL exhibited more cell killing activity
than AdE4 (P<0.01), and lovastatin enhanced this even
more when used with AdE4-TRAIL (P<0.01). Together,
these in vitro results show that lovastatin significantly
enhanced the cell killing activity of AdE4, and further
enhanced cell killing induced by AdE4-TRAIL.
We tested the extent of apoptosis induced by
lovastatin and adenovirus constructs in CWR22rv and
C4-2 cells. Cells were treated with lovastatin for 16 hours,
followed by virus infection for 24 hours. As shown in
Figure 2B, in CWR22rv cells, AdE4(∆TATA)(100 vp/

cell) induced minor cell apoptosis (12.2%). Lovastatin (5
μM) did not significantly affect AdE4(∆TATA)-induced
apoptosis (16.3%). AdE4 (100 vp/cell) induced more
cell apoptosis than AdE4(∆TATA) (25.1%). Lovastatin
(5 μM) significantly increased AdE4 (100 vp/cell)induced cell apoptosis (43.6%) (P<0.01). AdE4-TRAIL
exhibited a stronger apoptosis induction effect than
AdE4 (40.2%, P<0.01); lovastatin further enhanced cell
apoptosis of AdE4-TRAIL (62.4%, P<0.01). In C4-2
cells, AdE4(∆TATA)(50 vp/cell) induced minor cell
apoptosis (14.5%), while lovastatin (2.5 μM) did not
significantly increase AdE4(∆TATA)-induced apoptosis
(15.3%). AdE4 (50 vp/cell) induced more cell apoptosis
than AdE4(∆TATA) (28.2%, P<0.01). Lovastatin (2.5
μM) significantly increased AdE4 (50 vp/cell)-induced
cell apoptosis (37.4%, P<0.01). AdE4-TRAIL exhibited a
stronger apoptosis induction response than AdE4 (45.2%,
P<0.01). Lovastatin further enhanced the cell apoptosis
induced by AdE4-TRAIL (64.7%, P<0.01, Figure 2B).

Lovastatin
significantly
elevated
viral
transduction efficiency and AdE4-delivered
transgene expression

CWR22rv and C4-2 cells were pre-treated with lovastatin,
and then infected with AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL for 48 hours.
TRAIL protein expression was detected by western blot.
Lovastatin significantly increased AdE4-mediated TRAIL
protein expression (Figure 3C).

In order to investigate the mechanism by which
lovastatin enhances the in vivo antitumor effect of AdE4,
in vitro cell killing and apoptosis induction, we first tested
the effect of lovastatin on viral transduction efficiency and
AdE4-delivered transgene expression. CWR22rv and C4-2
cells were pre-treated with lovastatin, followed by AdE4
infection for 24 hours. AdE4 vector encodes the EGFP
gene, thereby allowing viral transduction efficiency to be
assessed using flow cytometry to measure the percentage
of green fluorescent cells. Compared to AdE4 alone,
lovastatin increased the percent of green fluorescent cells
by 23% or 27%, respectively, in CWR22rv or C4-2 cells
(P<0.01, Figure 3A). To confirm this result, we infected
the cells with AdE4-Luc, a PRRA vector expressing
luciferase gene (Figure 1a). Luciferase activity was
used as a measure of viral transduction efficiency, and
measuring with a luminometer. Consistent with its effects
in the AdE4 experiment, lovastatin significantly increased
luciferase activity by 4~5-fold in both cell lines (P<0.01,
Figure 3B).
We also tested TRAIL protein expression after

Lovastatin enhanced viral binding, internalization
and trafficking to nuclei
The adenoviral infection pathway includes several
critical steps: [1] Binding of adenovirus 5 capsid to cell
receptor CAR. [2] Internalization by endocytosis through
integrin αv, β1 and β3. [3] Lysis of the endosomal membrane,
resulting in escape to the cytosol to facilitate trafficking
along microtubules. [4] Binding to the nuclear envelop
to enable insertion of the viral genome through nuclear
pores. To test the impact of lovastatin on AdE4 binding,
internalization and trafficking to nuclei, viral particles
were continuously tracked after treating CWR22rv cells
with lovastatin, and then infecting with AdE4 infection.
The cells were incubated with adenoviral particles at 4ºC
for 60 mins. After PBS washing, the amount of adenoviral
particles was determined by assessing adenoviral E1a
copy number, using quantitative PCR. Then, cells were
incubated at 37ºC for another 30 minutes to allow time

with vehicle (DMSO) or lovastatin at 10 μM for 16 hours. Then cells were infected with 100 vp/cell of AdE4 (A.) or AdE4-Luc (B.) or
AdE4-TRAIL (C.) for the next 48 hours. AdE4-infected green fluorescent cells were monitored by FACS (A.); luciferase activity was
measured by a luminometer (B.); TRAIL protein expression was assessed by western blotting (C.), all as described in Methods.

for virus internalization and trafficking to nuclei to
occur. The attached but uninternalized viral particles
were removed by subtisilin. Internalized adenoviral
particles were analyzed for adenoviral E1a copy number
by quantitative PCR assays. Nuclear DNA was prepared
so that adenoviral E1a copy number inside nuclei could
be analyzed by quantitative PCR. As shown in Figure
4A, 4B and 4C, lovastatin significantly enhanced AdE4
viral binding, internalization and trafficking to nuclei.
Viral copy number increased by approximately 3.5-fold
in the viral binding assay, by approximately 2.5-fold in
the viral internalization assay, and by 1.6-fold in the assay
to assess viral trafficking to nuclei. These results suggest
that lovastatin significantly enhanced adenoviral binding,
while exhibiting lesser effects on viral internalization
and trafficking to nuclei. We speculate that the increased

viral copy number in viral internalization and trafficking
to nuclei can probably be attributed to the increased viral
binding.
To confirm that lovastatin enhanced viral trafficking
to nuclei, we monitored viral particles inside the cells. The
capsids of AdE4 first were chemically labeled with Alexa
Fluor® 488 dye, prior to virus infection. The intracellular
virions inside the cytoplasm and nuclei were assessed
using an Amnis ImageStreamX cell analyzer. As shown
in Figure 4D, at 30 minutes after allowing virus to bind
at 37ºC, AdE4 viral particles were detected in cytoplasm,
but few were detected inside the nuclei. Lovastatin
significantly enhanced the adenovirus intracellular
trafficking to nuclei, as most of the fluorescence in treated
cells was detected inside the nuclei (Figure 4D).

nuclei. A. CWR22rv cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or lovastatin at 10 μM for 16 hours, then exposed to 5000 vp/cell of AdE4

at 4ºC for 60 minutes. The unbound viral particles were removed; DNA of bound virus particles was processed for analysis of adenovirus
E1a copy number by quantitative PCR assay. B. After viral binding, cells were allowed to internalize virus particles at 37ºC for other 30

for 30 minutes, to allow for virus trafficking to the nuclei. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells and viral particles were monitored using

Lovastatin increased the replication activity of
AdE4

addition of cholesterol reduced lovastatin-induced cell
apoptosis from 32.4% to 23.6%. Based on the correlation
between induction of cell apoptosis by lovastatin and
lowered levels of cholesterol and lipid rafts on the cell
membranes, we speculate that the effect on apoptosis may
be affected via depletion of cholesterol in the lipid rafts.

To test if lovastatin increases the replication activity
of AdE4, we performed an adenovirus replication assay.
As described in table 1, we pre-treated C4-2 or CWR22rv
cells with lovastatin at 10 μM, and then infected cells
with AdE4 at the dose of 6.6 × 104 virus particles in C4-2
cells and 2 × 104 virus particles in CWR22rv (the virus
doses used to infect cells were based on the relative virus
infection efficiency of these two cell lines). The media
were changed 6 hours after administering virus; 2 days
later, supernatants were harvested to assess virus titer.
The amount of adenovirus produced was expressed as
TCID50. Lovastatin increased the virus titer from 2.5 ×
106 to 1.5 × 107 TCID50 in C4-2 cells and from 8 × 106
to 2.5 × 107 TCID50 in CWR22rv cells. These data show
that pre-treatment of lovastatin significantly promoted the
replication activity of AdE4 in PSA/PSMA-positive cells.

Lovastatin sensitizes PCa cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
induces cell apoptosis by binding to the death receptors,
DR4 and DR5 [11]. As shown in Figure 5C, A549, a
lung adenocarcinoma cell line and Lovo, a colorectal
cancer cell line exhibited high sensitivity to TRAILinduced apoptosis, while PC-3, a metastatic PCa cell line,
showed some sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Other PCa cell lines, CWR22rv, LNCaP and C4-2, and
non-malignant PZ-HPV-7 cells and keratinocytes were
resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Figure 5C). In the
PCa cell lines, LNCaP, C4-2 and PC-3, lovastatin (10 μM)
or TRAIL(200 ng/mL) alone induced cell apoptosis. The
percent apoptotic cells further increased when LNCaP,
C4-2 and PC-3 cells were treated with a combination
of lovastatin and TRAIL, but did not change in control
PZ-HPV-7 cells or keratinocytes (Figure 5D). These data
indicated that lovastatin selectively sensitized TRAILinduced apoptosis in cancer cells, but had no further effect
in non-malignant cell lines.

Correlation of lovastatin-induced cell apoptosis
with cholesterol level in lipid rafts on cell
membranes
Non-malignant cells PZ-HPV-7 and MCF10A, and
PCa cells C4-2, PC-3 and LNCaP cells were used to test
the efficacy of lovastatin on cell apoptosis. Lovastatin
(10 μM) selectively induced cell apoptosis in PCa cells,
but not in non-malignant cells. We labeled lipid rafts on
the cellular membrane with Alexa Fluo555/565-CTXB
(GM), and labeled cholesterol with filipin (CH). The
levels of lipid rafts and cholesterol on the membrane of
PCa cells were much higher in PCa cells, than in nonmalignant cells. Lipid raft levels were highest in PC-3
cells. Interestingly, the level of lipid rafts and cholesterol
inversely correlated with the sensitivity of cells to
lovastatin-induced apoptosis. We found that the higher
the level of lipid rafts and cholesterol, the greater the
magnitude of lovastatin-induced apoptosis (Figure 5A).
Because Lovastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug,
we tested the hypothesis that induction of apoptosis by
lovastatin is via depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts.
We treated C4-2 cells with 10 μM lovastatin alone for 16
hours, or with 500 μM cholesterol alone for 2 hours, or
10 μM lovastatin for 16 hours, and followed by 500 μM
cholesterol for 2 hours. Lovastatin significantly decreased
cholesterol and lipid raft levels on cell membranes. In
contrast, addition of cholesterol elevated the cholesterol
level in lipid rafts. The lovastatin depletion of cholesterol
and lipid rafts could be reversed by the addition of
cholesterol (Figure 5B). The levels of cholesterol and lipid
rafts on cell membranes closely correlated with apoptosis
induction by lovastatin. In C4-2 cells, lovastatin (10
μM) increased cell apoptosis from 9.8% to 32.4%, while
cholesterol did not significantly alter cell apoptosis. The

Lovastatin increased expression of adenovirus
binding receptors and TRAIL receptors in PCa
cells
Adenovirus 5 infects cells by binding to CAR
receptor, and internalizing into cells via the integrins [24].
The CAR receptors and integrins that bind adenovirus
reside in cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. Their expression
is closely associated with the status of lipid rafts, and is
affected by modification of lipid rafts [25-27]. Because
lovastatin depletes cholesterol level and affects lipid rafts,
we speculated that lovastatin might increase expression
of CAR, integrin αv, β1and β3, to enhance AdE4 binding
and internalization. We tested the effect of lovastatin on
expression levels of CAR and integrins αv, β1 and β3 on the
cell surface of CWR22rv and C4-2 cells, by either flow
cytometry or western blot. As we hypothesized, lovastatin
significantly increased the expression of CAR, consistent
with increased adenovirus binding (Figure 6C). Lovastatin
also slightly increased the expression of integrin β1
and β3 (Figure 6A and 6B) and integrin αv (Figure 6C),
consistent with enhanced virus internalization.. These
data are consistent with our findings of changes in viral
copy number after virus infection. Lovastatin enhanced

nuclei (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C). These data suggest that
lovastatin may enhance AdE4 infection efficiency and
virus-delivered transgene levels, in part, by increasing
the expression of adenovirus binding receptor CAR.
Additional viral binding promotes viral internalization
and trafficking to nuclei to increase virus replication and
apoptotic cell death.
We also assessed the effect of lovastatin on CAR

expression in control non-malignant PZ-HPV-7 cells.
Interestingly, lovastatin affected CAR expression
differently in normal PZ-HPV-7, compared to the cancer
cell lines. In CWR22rv and C4-2, which exhibit high
cholesterol levels in lipid rafts, lovastatin increased
CAR expression by depleting cholesterol in lipid rafts.
In the non-malignant cell lines, such as PZ-HPV-7 that
exhibit low cholesterol levels, lovastatin decreased CAR

expression (Figure 5A and Figure 6C).
Previous studies demonstrated that death receptors,
such as DR4 and DR5, are recruited into lipid rafts to
facilitate protein-protein interactions and apoptosis
induction [28]. Translocation of DR4/DR5 to lipid rafts
promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis [29]. When there is
lower DR4/DR5 expression in lipid rafts, cells exhibit
more resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [28]. We
hypothesized that, because lovastatin depleted cholesterol
in the lipid rafts, lovastatin may sensitize cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis by regulating DR4 and DR5 expression.
We tested the effect of lovastatin on DR4 and DR5
expression at the cell surface of CWR22rv and C4-2 cells,
using western blot. Lovastatin significantly increased DR4
expression, but not DR5 expression, and induced caspase3-mediated apoptosis (Figure 6D).
We tested the protein expression of CAR and DR4
by using IHC staining of tumor tissues harvested during
the in vivo studies. Lovastatin alone increased CAR
expression compared to the DMSO control. Lovastatin
significantly increased CAR expression inside tumor
tissues when combined with AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL,
compared to either AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL alone (Figure
6E). These results from in vivo experiments confirm
and extend our in vitro results. Lovastatin increased
DR4 expression inside tumor tissues, compared to the
DMSO control. Adenovirus infection slightly increased
DR4 expression, while lovastatin combined with AdE4
significantly increased DR4 expression inside tumor
tissues (P<0.01). In contrast, AdE4-TRAIL decreased
DR4 expression, probably because of the neutralization of
DR4 by TRAIL ligand. DR4 expression also decreased in
tumors treated with lovastatin and AdE4-TRAIL compared
to those treated with lovastatin and AdE4 (Figure 6F).

the inner leaflet [31]. Upon activation of key receptors by
ligand binding, lipid rafts cluster into larger macrodomains.
Various signaling molecules are recruited into these lipid
raft macrodomains, to form the signaling platforms for
transmembrane signal transduction [30-32]. Signaling
molecules include those associated with virus infection
signaling [33], apoptotic pathway signaling [34], death
receptor activation signaling [32], and carcinogenesis
[35]. Signal transduction can be affected by modifying the
cholesterol content of lipid rafts. The level of cholesterol
in lipid rafts was significantly higher in cancer cells than
normal cells, and cholesterol accumulation enhanced
cancer transformation and progression [36, 37]. Statins,
such as lovastatin [38, 39] and simvastatin [37, 40], which
inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, catalyze a key
rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, and induce
cell apoptosis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling.
The adenovirus 5 binding receptor, CAR, and
integrins are found in cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts [2527]. Their expression is closely associated with the status
of lipid rafts, such that modification of lipid rafts affects
their expression [25-27]. CAR receptors and integrins,
are critical for adenovirus 5 binding and internalization
in cells. In the current study, lovastatin significantly
increased the expression level of CAR, and slightly
increased the expression levels of integrins through
cholesterol-depletion in the lipid rafts of PCa cells. In
contrast, lovastatin decreased CAR expression in nonmalignant cell lines with low cholesterol content. The
results are consistent with the recent report that lovastatin
decreased CAR expression in human normal umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) [41]. We speculate
that the effect of lovastatin on CAR expression may
be selectively governed by the availability and level of
cholesterol in lipid rafts of cancer cells.
Lipid rafts are closely associated with the activation
of death receptors, such as DR4 [42], DR5 [42, 43] and
FAS [44], depending on the cell model system. TRAILinduced apoptosis is associated with lipid raft formation
and the status of death receptors inside the raft [45]. We
report for the first time that induction of apoptosis by
lovastatin correlated with the cholesterol level of lipid
rafts, and that apoptosis induced by lovastatin in vitro can
be mitigated by the addition of cholesterol. We speculate
that, by increasing death receptor expression, lovastatin
may overcome cancer cell resistance to TRAIL.
These studies, for the first time, demonstrate the
correlations between cholesterol/lipid rafts and oncolytic
adenovirus infection efficiency and antitumor efficacy of
TRAIL in vitro. These findings add to our understanding
of the molecular mechanisms that support the use of
lovastatin, in combination with PRRA-TRAIL, as a novel
experimental treatment strategy for refractory PCa in the
future.

DISCUSSION
In the present report, we explored the efficacy
of combining lovastatin with PRRA-mediated TRAIL
in preclinical experiments, as a novel strategy to treat
refractory PCa. The combination enhanced antitumor
efficacy in vivo and in vitro through activation of multiple
molecular mechanisms. Lovostatin enhanced the infection
efficiency of PRRA and virus-delivered transgene
expression by significantly increasing the expression
level of CAR, and slightly increasing the expression of
integrins. Lovastatin enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis
by increasing the expression of death receptor DR4.
Interestingly, these effects of lovastatin on CAR, integrins
and DR4 expression levels were closely associated with
lovastatin-depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts of cellular
membrane.
Lipid raft microdomains reside in plasma membrane
of cells, and they consist of dynamic assemblies of
cholesterol [30]. Lipids localize to the exoplasmic leaflet
of the membrane bilayer, while cholesterol is found in

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell lines and cell culture
PSA/PSMA positive PCa cell lines LNCaP, C42, CWR22rv and negative PCa cell lines PC3 and
DU145 (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), were each
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Non small
lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, and the Lovo
colon cancer cell line (ATCC), were maintained in
DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Immortalized, non-malignant
breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, was maintained
in the growth media as previously reported [46]. Nonmalignant, prostate epithelial cell line, PZ-HPV-7 (ATCC),
and keratinocytes (Lonza, Anaheim, CA, USA) were
maintained in KGM-Gold Bullet Kit (containing KBMGold Basal Medium plus KGM-Gold SingleQuot Kit).

In vivo animal studies
A subcutaneous tumor xenograft model using
the CWR22rv cell line was established as described
previously [4]. Mice were inoculated with CWR22rv
cells (1× 106 in 100 mL culture media) by subcutaneous
injection. When tumor size reached ~5 mm in diameter at
2-3 weeks after cell inoculation, the mice were randomly
assigned to 6 groups. Three groups, received 10 mg/kg/
day of lovastatin in DMSO, and another 3 groups, served
as controls, received PBS with the same dose of DMSO
daily ip injections for 7 days. After the 7 day period, mice
in each three groups individually received intratumor (i.t.)
injections of 2×107 infectious unit (IFU) of AdE4PSESE1a
(AdE4), AdE4-TRAIL or PBS control. To clarify, mice
were sorted into the following groups (n=8 each group):
[1] DMSO (i.p.), [2] lovastatin (i.p.), [3] AdE4PSESE1a
(AdE4, i.t.), [4] AdE4-TRAIL (i.t.), [5] lovastatin (i.p.)
with AdE4 (i.t.), and [6] lovastatin (i.p.) with AdE4TRAIL (i.t.). Tumor size was measured with calipers on
days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28, and tumor volume was calculated
as length × width2 × 0.5236 [45]. Mice were sacrificed
when tumor size exceeded 1000 mm3, or on day 28 if
tumor size did not reach 1000 mm3.

Cell Killing Assay
C4-2 and CWR22rv cells were each seeded onto
24-well plates (1 × 105/well), and treated with lovastatin
(10 uM), AdE4(∆TATA)(replication-deficient adenovirus),
AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL at 100 virus particle (vp)/cell, or
lovastatin (10 uM) for 16 hours, and followed by virus
infection of AdE4(∆TATA), AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL. Four
wells were used for each treatment. All cells were stained
with crystal violet dye at 5 days after virus infection, and
lysed for OD read at 590 nm.

Cell Viability Assay

After mice were sacrificed, tumors were collected
and immediately fixed in 10% phosphate buffered
formalin, processed, embedded in paraffin and cut into
5 um thin histological sections. To assess adenovirus
infection, mouse monoclonal (SPM 230) antibody
(ready for use) against adenovirus type 5 E1a (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) and a super sensitive biotinylated
second mouse antibody (BioGenex, San Francisco, CA,
USA) were used. To assess expression of CAR and DR4
protein, antibodies against CAR (H-300) or DR4 (C-20)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were
used. Assessment of in situ apoptosis was performed with
the TUNEL assay, using the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche Dianostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Positivestaining cells were counted in 10 randomly selected vision
fields (× 200) in each tissue slide. We counted cells in 3
slides for each tumor. Results were expressed as mean ±
standard deviation of 30 measurements/tumor.

LNCap, C4-2, CWR22rv, PC-3, DU145, PZHPV-7, keratinocytes, A549 and Lovo cells were each
treated with TRAIL protein (R&D, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) at a range of doses. Cell viability was measured by
MTT assay 72 hours after drug treatment.

Flow Cytometry Analysis to detect Cell Apoptosis
CWR22rv and C4-2 cells were each seeded onto
12-well plates (2.5 × 105/well), and treated with either
vehicle control (DMSO), or 10 μM lovastatin, for 16 hours
before infection with AdE4(∆TATA)(replication-deficient),
AdE4 or AdE4-TRAIL, at 100 vp/cell (n=3 wells/group).
Cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin 48 hours postvirus infection, and washed once with PBS preparatory
to apoptosis detection. Serum-starved PZ-HPV-7 and
MCF10A and C4-2, PC-3 and LNCaP cells were treated
with 10 μM lovastatin for 24 hours, using triplicate-wells
for each cell line. Serum-starved LNCaP cells were treated
with or without 10 μM lovastatin for 16 hours, and then
incubated with or without 500 μM cholesterol for 2 hours.

PCR assay.

Viral Replication Assay

Virus Binding and Intercellular Trafficking
Detection by Imagestream Cell Analyzer

C4-2 and CWR22rv cells were seeded onto 6-well
plates (1 × 106/well), and treated with 10 μM lovastatin
for 16 hours. Then cells were infected with AdE4 at 6.6
× 104 vp in C4-2 and 2 × 104 vp in CWR22rv cells to
ensure equivalent viral infection efficiency. The doses for
these cell lines were identified in preliminary experiments.
The media were changed 6 hours after virus infection. The
cells were harvested, and subjected to 3 freeze/thaw cycles
48 hours post-virus infection. Virus soup was harvested,
and titrated using virus titer assay described in previous
publications, with the amount of produced adenovirus was
expressed as TCID50 [4, 8].

AdE4 virus particles were labeled with Alexa
Fluor® 488 dye. Next, suspended CWR22rv cells were
incubated with AdE4 (5000 vp/cell) at 4 ºC, with vigorous
shaking for 60 minutes [47]. Cells were then cultured at
37 ºC for 30 minutes. After brief staining with DAPI,
the cells were entered into the Amnis ImageStreamX cell
analyzer (Amnis Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA) using
low flow rate/high sensitivity settings, and evaluated
using INSPIRE™ software. Amnis ImageStream Analyzer
and IDEAS Analysis Software represent advances
in multispectral imaging technology, because cell
morphology and fluorescent labeling of genes or proteins
can be simultaneously visualized in single cells. This
powerful combination of quantitative image analysis and
flow cytometry in a single platform creates exceptional
new experimental capabilities [48]. The instrument and
INSPIRE™ software were set up as follows: Channel
1(DAPI); Channel 2 (virus, Alexa Fluor® 488); Channel
3 (brightfield); and Channel 6 (scattering channel).
Magnification was set at 60×, providing a pixel size of
0.33 microns. The 405 nm and 488 nm lasers were used
to activate multispectral fluorescence. The flow rate
was set to low speed/high sensitivity; stream alignment
was adjusted as necessary. The co-localization of virus
and cellular nuclei, or virus and cells in brightfield was
analyzed by IDEAS software.

Fluorescence Labeling of Cells for Lipid Raft and
Cholesterol Detection
Cells were grown on chamber slides (Nalgen Nunc
International, Monroe County, NY, USA), and fixed in
3% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, before
being incubated with 1 ml of 1.5 mg glycine/ml PBS for
10 min at room temperature, to quench fluorescence due to
paraformaldehyde. The cells were then labeled with Alexa
Fluo555/565-CTXB (0.5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes of Life
Technology, Grand Island, NY, USA) for 10 minutes on
ice. After rinsing in PBS, the cells were incubated with
1 ml of Filipin working solution (0.05 mg/ml in PBS,
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 2 h at room
temperature. Using confocal microscopy, glycolipoprotein
microdomains (GM, lipid rafts) were viewed first, using
a 543 nm laser, and then cholesterol was viewed, using a
UV 350nm laser.

vp/cell. DMSO-treated cells were used as the control.
Cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin 24 hours postinfection, washed with FACS buffer (PBS with 5% FBS
and 0.1% sodium azide) on ice, and then fixed in 0.5 ml
of cold 1% paraformaldehyde solution. The GFP positive
cells were analyzed.by flow cytometry.

The experiment protocol was developed according
to Wang, et al’s report with modification [47]. Suspended
CWR22rv cells were incubated with AdE4 (5000vp/cell)
at 4 ºC, with vigorous shaking for 60 minutes, and the
unbound viral particles were removed by washing cells in
cold PBS 3 times. The DNA of bound virus particles was
processed for analysis of adenovirus E1a copy number by
quantitative PCR assay. After viral binding, virus particles
were allowed to internalize and traffic to nuclei, at 37ºC
for 30 minutes. To assess viral internalization, the attached
but uninternalized viral particles were first removed using
