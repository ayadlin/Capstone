ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary
brain tumor. Despite the advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patient
survival averages only 14.6 months. In most GBM tumors, tyrosine kinases show
increased activity and/or expression and actively contribute to the development,
recurrence and onset of treatment resistance; making their inhibition an appealing
therapeutic strategy. We compared the cytotoxicity of 12 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in
vitro. A combination of crizotinib and dasatinib emerged as the most cytotoxic across
established and primary human GBM cell lines. The combination treatment induced
apoptotic cell death and polyploidy. Furthermore, the combination treatment led to the
altered expression and localization of several tyrosine kinase receptors such as Met
and EGFR and downstream effectors as such as SRC. Furthermore, the combination
treatment reduced the migration and invasion of GBM cells and prevented endothelial
cell tube formation in vitro. Overall, our study demonstrated the broad specificity of a
combination of crizotinib and dasatinib across multiple GBM cell lines. These findings
provide insight into the development of alternative therapy for the treatment of GBM.

such as the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met),
the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in
the mesenchymal, proneural and classical subtypes,
respectively [7]. Furthermore, recent studies have also
confirmed tumours harboring more than one subtype [8, 9].
The implication of RTKs in the development,
recurrence and treatment resistance of GBM [10] has
led to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
emerging as new treatment options. We assessed 12 TKIs
inhibiting various kinases associated with the development
and progression of GBM. Dasatinib and crizotinib were
the most potent and reduced cell viability in a panel of
GBM cell lines. Dasatinib is a broad spectrum inhibitor
of SRC family kinases such as the non-receptor tyrosine
kinases SRC, Fyn and Lyn [11]. SRC is frequently
constitutively activated in GBM cell lines and patient
tumors [12] and contributes to the invasive potential of
GBM in vivo [13]. Crizotinib inhibits the Met, ROS1

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a grade IV
astrocytoma, is the most frequent and aggressive
malignant primary brain tumor with a 5-year survival
rate of 5% [1]. GBM is principally idiopathic, although
several genetic mutations, epigenetic variations, viral
infections and environmental factors have been identified
as potential risk factors [2–5]. The standard treatment for
GBM involves surgical resection and radiotherapy with
concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide administration
[6]. Despite the three-pronged treatment strategy, relapse is
universal. The limited efficacy of the current treatments is
partially a consequence of the heterogeneity of the tumour
cell population. GBM is classified into four subtypes, the
classical, mesenchymal, proneural and neural subtypes
all characterised by distinct transcriptional profiles [7].
The subtypes are associated with the amplification and/
or mutation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)

and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) RTKs. Met
is expressed in all GBM cell lines [14], up to 72% of
primary GBM tumors [15], promotes hypoxia driven
invasion and the development of the pseudopalisades that
are characteristic of GBM [16–18]. Furthermore, Met is
also associated with the aquired resistance to cetuximab, a
monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR [19]. ALK is poorly
characterised in GBM but a number of reports suggest a
role in the increased proliferation of GBM cells [20, 21].
In the current study, we demonstrate that a
combination of dasatinib and crizotinib suppressed the
viability of four established and two primary GBM cell
lines. The combination also reduced the viability of GBM
tumour spheroids. Moreover, our data indicates that the
combination suppressed the activity and expression
of Met, SRC and their downstream effectors. The
combination synergistically increased apoptosis and
abolished migration and invasion of the GBM cells and
prevent neo-angiogenesis. Together, our results support the
efficacy of the combination of two TKIs, dasatinib and
crizotinib, for the treatment of GBM by targeting different
oncogenic signaling pathways.

to the drug. The spheroids were grown for 4 days and
photographed before being treated with dasatinib,
crizotinib or combination for 4 days (Figure 1B and
1C). At the end of the treatment period, spheroids
were photographed and viability of the cells measured
via an acid phosphatase activity assay (Figure 1DI-II).
The combination was consistently more cytotoxic than
the single treatments and decreased the viability of the
tumor spheroids by nearly 70%. Furthermore, using
the U87 spheroids, we measured the effect of treatment
on cell proliferation using an antibody directed against
Ki67, a cellular marker of proliferation (Figure 1BIII).
The control spheroid exhibited an intense Ki67 staining
on the surface of the spheroid. Treatment with dasatinib
reduces Ki67 expression but has no effect on the spheroid
size despite a reduction of the cell number by nearly 20%
(Figure 1DI). The treatment with crizotinib decreases
cell proliferation while the combination limited Ki67
expression to a small number of cells at the periphery of
the tumor spheroid (Figure 1BIII).

RESULTS

We then tested the effect of the combination
treatment on the expression of proteins associated with
cell proliferation, survival and invasion. The combination
decreased EGFR expression in LN-18, A172 and
NZG1003 cells while abolishing it in U87, U373 and
NZG0906 cells. Furthermore, the combination abolishes
the expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a protein
involved in the migration and invasion of cancer cells.
Dasatinib was also highly effective in the suppression
of FAK while crizotinib treatment slightly reduced
its expression only in the two primary cell lines. The
phosphorylation of Met, the RTK targeted by crizotinib,
was significantly decreased by dasatinib treatment
in U87, LN-18, U373 and NZG1003 cells, but not in
A172 or NZG0906 cells while crizotinib increased Met
expression in all cell lines. We then considered the effect
of combination treatment on the downstream effectors of
these kinases. In our study, the phosphorylation of SRC is
abolished in all cell lines while the expression of total SRC
is not consistently altered following dasatinib treatment
(Figure 2). Treat­ment with crizotinib did not affect the
expression of SRC but reduced its phosphorylation. The
combination completely suppressed SRC phosphorylation
in all cell lines (Figure 2). AKT is a key signal transduction
pathway found to be constitutively active in multiple
GBM cell lines and tumors. The combination completely
abolishes AKT phosphorylation in all cell lines but total
AKT expression was only abolished in combination
treated NZG0906 cells. We also evaluated the effect of
treatment on cyclin D1 (CD1) expression. Dasatinib is
a potent cytostatic agent and reduced CD1 expression
in all cell lines but U87 while crizotinib increased CD1

TKIs reduce GBM cell viability in vitro
We assessed the effect of several TKIs including
sorafenib, nilotinib, sunitinib, imatinib, gefitinib,
lapatinib, PD-173074, selumetinib, tofacitinib, pazopanib,
dasatinib and crizotinib on the cellular viability of four
established GBM cell lines (Table 1). The tyrosine
kinases targeted were demonstrated to have an increased
activity and/or expression in GBM and contribute to the
progression, recurrence and treatment resistance of these
tumors. The combination of dasatinib and crizotinib was
the most cytotoxic across all the cell lines. We optimized
the concentrations for both drugs to obtain a potent effect
across all etablished and primary GBM cell lines used in
this study and proceeded with 0.2 μM of dasatinib and
4 μM of crizotinib. Dasatinib and crizotinib treatment
reduced the number of cells between 35 to 52% and 45 to
75%, respectively, across all cell lines over a 72 h period
(Figure 1). Combination of crizotinib and dasatinib was
more cytotoxic compared to the single treatments and
decreased the number of cells by 71 to 90% (Figure 1A).

combination abolishes perinuclear and lamellipodial
SRC localization and disperses SRC within the
cytoplasm (Figure 3A). In U373 cells, SRC expression

crizotinib, dasatinib and combination (Figure 3B).

also in the perinuclear region in both cell lines while

changes in the cellular morphology. SRC is known
to influence the activity of multiple ion transporters
[22] and treatment with dasatinib reduced the cell area
by 50% in both cell lines. Met regulates cell cycle

cycle [23] and crizotinib treatment increased cell area
by nearly 2.5- and 1.3-fold in LN-18 and U373 cells,
respectively. In addition, crizotinib treatment promoted
polynucleation in both cell lines. The combination
treatment decreases the cell volume and polynucleation
relative to crizotinib treatment.

lysates were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies as indicated.

treatment, a synergistic increase in apoptosis was observed
after treatment for 72 h in all cell lines (Figure 4). For
example, in LN-18 cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells
is 1.3, 33.9 and 59.3% following dasatinib, crizotinib and
combination treatments respectively.
To determine if the effects triggered by dasatinib
and crizotinib are transient or associated with prolonged
changes, we removed the drug containing media, replaced
it with fresh growth media and measured the apoptosis
over the subsequent 72 h. The maintenance of apoptosis
was heavily influenced by the cell line (Figure 4). In U87
cells, the number of apoptotic cells following combination
treatment decreased rapidly to 8.4% 24 h after washout
relative to 58.5% following 72 h of treatment. Importantly,
the synergistic effect observed by the combination was
lost and the apoptosis was comparable to the crizotinib
treatment. Conversely, in LN-18, U373 and A172 cells,
the synergistic increase of apoptosis triggered by the

We previously demonstrated by western blot that
crizotinib and combination treatment resulted in the
activation of caspase-3 (Figure 2). We further confirmed
that the mode of cell death was via apoptosis using
flow cytometry to measure early apoptotic events using
annexin-V and PI staining as markers of the apoptotic
and necrotic processes respectively. The concentration
of dasatinib used in these experiments did not promote
necrosis or apoptosis in any of the cell lines at any time
point (Figure 4). The reduction in cell number observed
with the SRB (Figure 1A), reduction in Ki67 staining of
spheroids (Figure 1 BIII), lack of caspase-3 activation
(Figure 2) and lack of apoptosis or necrosis induction
(Figure 4) suggests that the mechanism of action of
dasatinib is cytostatic. Conversely, crizotinib treatment
induces apoptosis but not necrosis in all four established

both drugs are able to alter DNA synthesis and cell cycle
progression. Cell cycle analysis showed that dasatinib
treatment transiently promotes accumulation of the cells
in G1 phase of the cell cycle (1X DNA content) in all cell
lines after 48 h treatment (Figure 5). Following treatment
with crizotinib for 48 and 72 h, a significant number of
cells accumulated in the G2/M phase (2X DNA content) of
the cell cycle (p ≤ 0.01) (Supplementary Tables S1–S4).
However, even though this cell population failed to
complete mitosis, they were able to re-enter the cell cycle
and cause the formation of tetraploid (4X DNA content)
and octoploid (8X DNA content) cells. The effect of
crizotinib on G2/M accumulation and polyploidy were
consistent after 48 and 72 h incubation but differs in
intensity across all cell lines. LN-18 and U373 showed

a rapid increase of tetraploid (4X DNA content) and
octoploid (8X DNA content) cell populations while
U87 and A172 are mainly characterized by G2/M arrest
(Figure 5). The combination treatment also increased the
quantity of the polyploid cell population relative to control
cells but significantly reduces the proportion of tetraploid
and octoploid cells relative to crizotinib treatment. For
example, in LN-18 cells, the number of tetraploid and
octoploid cells following crizotinib treatment was 39.3
and 15.6% while the in the combination the number
were reduced to 12.7 and 1.2%, respectively. Following

mitotic apparatus. The mitotic spindles are involved in
the segregation of chromatids and are the result of the
interaction of a myriad of proteins dictating the dynamics
of microtubule nucleation through polymerization of α
and β tubulin dimers. As shown in Figure 6, control and
dasatinib treated cells exhibit normal mitotic spindle
structures. Contrarily, treatment with crizotinib and
combination for 48 h severely disrupts the formation
of the mitotic spindle in LN-18 cells. This disruption is
likely a consequence of the inhibition of aurora kinases
by crizotinib and provides a plausible mechanism for
the previously observed polynucleation (Figure 3) and
polyploidy (Figure 5).

Crizotinib treatment disrupts correct mitotic
spindle formation
We previously observed that following crizotinib or

one nucleus (Figure 3) and had up to 8-fold the normal

The combination of crizotinib and dasatinib
prevents migration, invasion, HUVEC tube
formation and tube-like formation of GBM cells

is no apparent tube-like formation of HUVEC cells. When
U87, U373, and A172 cells are seeded onto the Geltrex
basement membrane, they also form long projections
resembling that of the HUVEC cells, termed vascular
mimicry. In these cells combination treatment completely
abolishes the formation of the tube-like projections in
both U87 and U373 cells and greatly reduces tube-like
formation in A172 cells. LN-18 cells do not form these
projections and so were not included in this experiment.

The capacity of GBM cells to invade the surrounding
brain parenchyma is a serious impediment to the effective
application of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As seen in
Figure 7A, migration of LN-18 cells is reduced following
dasatinib and crizotinib treatment and abolished by
combination treatment, at concentrations of 0.2 μM
dasatinib and 0.75 μM crizotinib, insufficient to promote
cell death after 20 h incubation. Furthermore, when the
ability of cells to invade through a basement membrane
was assessed, this sub-cytotoxic dose was sufficient to
reduce the invasion of LN-18 cells by 80% following
combination treatment (Figure 7B).
In vitro models of angiogenesis, using HUVEC
cells, and vascular mimicry, using tumor cells, have been
employed to ascertain if the current drug combination
shows potential efficacy. As can be seen in Figure 8, the
tube-like formation of HUVEC is inhibited by treatment
with dasatinib while treatment with crizotinib has a
moderate effect. Following combination treatment there

DISCUSSION
The development of alternative and effective ways
to treat and reduce the recurrence of GBM is being
actively explored. The Cancer Genome Atlas has identified
the amplification of several RTKs such as EGFR, ERBB2,
PDGFRα, Kit, vascular endothelial growth factor 2
(VEGFR-2), fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, insulin
receptor substrate 2 and Met [24–26]. Tyrosine kinase
inhibitors have emerged as effective cancer therapeutics
in many types of cancers and are being assessed for the
treatment of GBM. Currently, 139 clinical trials in phase
I or II using 27 different TKIs targeting various receptor

and non-receptor tyrosine kinases are active worldwide for
the treatment of GBM. Although many molecular targets
have already been identified, the efficacy of a specific TKI
remains questionable due to the multiplicity, redundancy
and heterogeneity of GBM signaling pathways which
change during the course of the development of the tumor
[27] and in response to treatment [28]. Furthermore, a
subset of patients may have tumors with characteristics
of more than one subtype [8]. Thus it is conceivable that
the use of a combination of drugs would provide a better
therapeutic outcome.
The present study described the response of
four established and two primary GBM cell lines to
a combination of the TKIs, crizotinib and dasatinib.
Dasatinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases which are
reported to be overexpressed or constitutively active in
GBM such as the SRC family kinases, Kit, macrophage
colony-stimulating factor receptor, PDGFR-α and  –β,
EphB1, EpHB2 and EphB4 [29–32]. The crossexamination of the broadly selective TKIs assessed
in our study (Table 1) identified SRC as a protein of
interest. SRC plays a key role in the signal transduction
of a diverse panel of cell surface receptors such as Met,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PDGFR, EGFR and EGFRvIII, expressed in 25–64% of
GBM patients [33–38]. SRC is involved in the regulation
of a variety of cellular processes including cell volume
regulation, cell proliferation and invasion. In the cell lines
considered in this study, SRC was constitutively active
which has also been observed in patient tumor samples
[12]. The other TKI used in the combination treatment,
crizotinib, inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases including
Met, RON and ALK [39]. In this study, we considered
only the effect of treatment on Met expression due
to the paucity of understanding of the contribution of
ALK and ROS1 to GBM. Western blots confirmed that
the signaling of both SRC and Met was suppressed by
single and combination treatment while the activity of
the proliferative and survival downstream effector AKT
was effectively suppressed by the combination treatment
in both established and primary cell lines. Furthermore,
the combination treatment was sufficient to reduce the
expression of tyrosine kinases known to be overexpressed
and to contribute to the progression and invasion of GBM
such as EGFR and FAK [40, 41].
Dasatinib has proven to be well tolerated in
clinical trials, but failed to improve overall survival

either as a monotherapy or when combined to erlotinib
[42], lomustine [43] or bevacizumab [44] for recurrent
GBM. The limited efficacy of dasatinib was attributed
to poor accumulation in the brain due to the activity of
ATP-binding cassette transporters such as P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein which are
highly expressed on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and
glioblastoma cells [45, 46]. Our data and the data from
previous studies [47] suggests that the limited efficacy
may also be a consequence of the action of dasatinib
being cytostatic as opposed to cytotoxic. This effect was
highlighted by the absence of apoptosis and necrosis
markers following treatment and the increase in G1
phase seen following 48 and 72 h dasatinib treatment
(Figure 4).
No clinical trials examining the efficacy of
crizotinib in GBM patients have been completed to
date. Although, there have been several clinical trials
initiated to test inhibitors of Met using small molecule
inhibitors such as crizotinib (NCT02270034) and
cabozantinib (NCT00704288) or antibodies directed
against Met (NCT01632228). Crizotinib exhibits poor
BBB penetration [48]; however, the BBB is often
severely disrupted in the region of a tumor lesion and the
pathological changes of the tumor vasculature increase
permeability to small molecules [49]. Crizotinib is also
a potent inhibitor of P-gp transport [41], it is possible
that crizotinib treatment may prolonged the efficacy of a
combination with dasatinib by reducing their efflux from
the tumor tissue. Promisingly, combination treatment
is sufficient to promote apoptotic cell death which was
maintained for up to 72 hours following the removal of
the drugs. This is an encouraging observation as it lowers
the possibility of resistance emerging as the cells are
committed to cell death.
The combination of dasatinib and crizotinib was
shown to increase apoptosis but also to significantly
reduce the proliferation of GBM cells. The promotion
of cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle
and the formation of polyploid cells by combination
treatment was confirmed by western blot, FACS and
immunocytochemistry analysis. Perturbations of the cell
cycle were associated with a reduction of CD1 expression
across all the cell lines. CD1 expression is generally
associated with the transition from G1/S and S/G2, however
in cancer cells, its expression is high throughout the S and
G2/M phases, promoting the constitutive phosphorylation
of the retinoblastoma protein [50, 51]. CD1 expression
is regulated by SRC (Figure 2) and downregulation of
SRC activity is sufficient to decrease CD1 expression and
subsequently cell proliferation [52]. CD1 upregulation,
however, was observed in crizotinib treated cells (Figure
2) and is associated with an increased proportion of
polyploid cells [53], also observed following crizotinib
treatment (Figure 5).

Cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase is usually sufficient
to trigger apoptosis; in our study, the increased proportion
of cells in the G2/M phase observed in the combination
treatment is associated with a larger quantity of apoptotic
cells. The G2/M phase accumulation can be the result of the
formation of aberrant mitotic spindles observed following
crizotinib and combination treatments (Figure 6) which
is usually associated with the impaired segregation of
chromosomes, G2/M arrest and increased apoptosis [54].
We also observed an increased number of polyploid
(4X and 8X DNA) cells following crizotinib treatment
which seems to be associated with a decreased number
of apoptotic cells. Studies have suggested that polyploidy
is associated with apoptosis resistance [55]. While the
combination treatment also increased the proportion
of polyploid cells relative to control the proportion
of polyploid cells relative to crizotinib treatment was
decreased. This combination may reduce treatment
resistance by avoiding the genetic instability induced by
crizotinib monotherapy.
Moreover, our results showed that the combination
treatment decreased migration and reduced cellular invasion,
both essential to metastases. The anti-invasive potential
of the combination of dasatinib and crizotinib occurs at
low crizotinib concentration. This effect is a particularly
important observation as invasion into the surrounding
healthy brain ultimately reduces the efficacy of all standard
treatments for GBM. Traditional chemotherapies are often
ineffective against invading cells as these cells suppress
their proliferation, reducing the damage caused by agents
that promote DNA damage [56]. Moreover, GBM lesions
are highly vascularized [57] but antiangiogenic therapies
show poor efficacy in GBM [58]. Our results show that
the combination of dasatinib and crizotinib decreases
angiogenesis and vascular mimicry in an in vitro model.
The combination of the anti-angiogenic and anti-invasive
properties is an essential consideration as the clinical
usefulness of Bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic therapy, has
been limited by the promotion of the invasive phenotype [59].
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that a
combination of dasatinib and crizotinib was sufficient to
promote apoptosis, reduce cell migration and invasion and
abolish neo-angiogenesis. The combination was sufficient
to reduce the activity of signaling pathways essential for
GBM survival and treatment resistance. These findings
suggest that the combination approach has therapeutic
potential, and further studies are warranted to test its
efficacy in vivo.

rabbit anti-Ki67 (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Slides were incubated with biotinylated goat antirabbit (Dako, Campbellfield, Australia) and then with
streptavidin (BD Pharmingen) before development with
3, 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (BD
Pharmingen) and counterstaining with hematoxylin QS
(Vector Laboratories).

Mode of cell death
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (65,000 cells/
well) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated as
indicated and incubated for 48 and 72 h. For washout
experiments, the media was aspirated, and the cells
washed twice with PBS, before addition of fresh growth
media. At the end of the treatment period, apoptosis was
assessed using Annexin-V-FLUOS/propidium iodide
(PI) staining, as described previously [62]. Samples
were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer,
and the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined
using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA).

Cell culture
A172 and LN-18 cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. U373 cells were
generously provided by Dr. Andrew Bahn (University
of Otago, New Zealand). Cells were cultured in RPMI
medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere
at 37°C, 5% CO2. Spheroids were grown in 96 well
plates with a non-adherent base of 50 μL 1.5% agarose.
Primary GBM cells (NZG0906 and NZG1003) were
isolated and cultured from GBM material obtained from
patients undergoing debulking surgery as described
previously [60].

Cell cycle
Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (65,000 cells/
well) and incubated for 24 h before treatment. At the
end of the treatment period, cell cycle distribution was
assessed using PI staining, as previously described [62].
Cells were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and the proportion
of cells in each of G0/G1-, S- and G2/M-phases were
determined using CellQuest Pro software.

Cytotoxicity
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (U87: 6,000,
LN-18: 5,000, U373: 4,000, A172: 4,000 cells/well) and
incubated for 24 h. The cells were then treated as indicated
in each experiment and incubated for a further 72 h. The
cytotoxicity was assessed using a sulforhodamine B (SRB)
assay as described previously [61]. Viability of spheroids
was assessed using the acid phosphatase assay. Spheroids
were collected into tubes, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000
RPM and washed 3 times with cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS). The supernatant was aspirated and 100 μL
of cold PBS was placed on top and the spheroid sonicated.
The solution was transferred to a 96 well plate and 100 μL
of 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and
2 mg/mL para-Nitrophenylphosphate was added to each
well. The solution was incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes
before the reaction was halted using 10 μL of NaOH and
the absorbance read at 405 nm deducting background at
630 nm. Acid phosphatase samples were conducted in
sextuplicate and the experiment independently repeated 3
times.

Immunoblotting
Cells were seeded in petri dishes (200,000 cells) and
incubated for 24 h before being treated for 48 h. Following
the treatment period, the cells were washed with PBS and
lysed in Tris-HCl 50 mM (pH 8), sodium chloride (NaCl)
150 mM, Triton X-100 1%, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
1%, sodium fluoride (NaF) 1 mM, sodium orthovanadate
200 μM, and protease inhibitors (leupeptin 1 μg/mL,
aprotinin 1 μg/mL, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)
1 mM). The lysates were cleared from insoluble material
by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, subjected to
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by
western blotting.
