BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling plays a pivotal role in gliomagenesis. The authors
previously demonstrated that adenosine diphospate-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a member of the
Ras-related small guanosine-50 -triphospate-binding protein family, is required for EFA6A-induced glioma cell
migration and invasion. However, the role of ARF6 in EGF signaling is unknown. METHODS: The authors analyzed messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of ARF6 and EGF receptor (EGFR) in 16 high-grade glioma samples
and in 6 low-grade glioma samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. To determine whether EGF induces ARF6 expression in human glioblastoma U87 cells through transcriptional regulation and EGFR activation, the levels of ARF6 were assayed in EGF-treated U87 cells that were
preincubated with a transcriptional inhibitor (actinomycin D) and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(PD153035), respectively. The downstream signaling of EGFR-mediated ARF6 up-regulation also was investigated using specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), phosphatidylinositol 30 kinase
(PI3K), and Janus kinase 2. The involvement of SP1 in the downstream signaling was studied by using an
SP1 inhibitor (mithramycin A). Small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting ARF6 were used to investigate
the effects of ARF6 on EGF-mediated glioma cell proliferation. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that
ARF6 and EGFR mRNA levels were elevated in glioma tissues. Furthermore, EGF stimulated ARF6 expression
in U87 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependant manner. This stimulation was caused by increased transcription of ARF6 and by activation of the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and
PI3K signaling pathways. It is noteworthy that SP1 was essential for EGF-induced ARF6 up-regulation. Finally,
EGF-induced glioblastoma cell proliferation depended on ARF6, because the suppression of ARF6 by siRNA
or by a dominant-negative mutant significantly inhibited EGF-induced cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The
results of the current study suggested that EGF-induced ARF6 expression plays a significant role in glioma

Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors,
are classified into 4 grades according to their tumor cell
types and histology.1 Among all, glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) (World Health Organization grade 4) is the most
aggressive form and is characterized by a high degree of
cellularity, vascular proliferation, and necrosis.2 GBM
represents >50% of all gliomas and results in serious
neurologic morbidity and mortality. Patients who are
diagnosed with GBM usually have a median survival of
12 to 15 months.3
GBMs either arise de novo (primary) or progress
from lower grade (secondary) gliomas, and they are
marked by a series of genetic alterations and dynamic progressions.4 One of the most frequent genetic aberrations
in high-grade glioma is the amplification of epidermal
growth factor (EGR) receptor (EGFR), which has been
detected in 40% to 60% of patients with GBM.5 It has
been demonstrated that EGF stimulates the growth,
migration, and invasiveness of GBM cells in vitro,3 and it
plays a pivotal role in GBM carcinogenesis.6 To date, it
has been estimated that approximately 50% of glioblastomas with EGFR amplification express variant EGFR
molecules. The most common variant is variant III
(EGFRvIII), which is caused by the genomic deletion of
exons 2 through 7.7 This variant persistently activates the
phosphatidylinositol 30 kinase (PI3K) and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signalregulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 (ERK1/2) (MEK/
ERK1/2) signaling pathways, which control cell survival,
proliferation, and motility.8
Adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor 6
(ARF6) is a member of the Ras superfamily of small G
proteins. It has multiple biologic actions, including membrane trafficking, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1)-mediated membrane ruffling, cell
motility, and activation of phospholipase D.9 ARF6 localizes in the cytosol and endosomes in its guanosine diphosphate-bound form and translocates to the plasma
membrane when it is bound to guanosine-50 -triphospate
(GTP).10 Through its specific guanine nucleotide
exchange factor ARONO,11 ARF6 can be activated by
various growth factors, such as hepatocyte growth
factor,12 colony-stimulating factor 1,13 and G proteincoupled receptor agonists.14 In our previous study, we
demonstrated that ARF6 is required for ARF6 exchange
factor (EFA6A)-induced glioma cell migration and
4960

invasion.15 However, the role of ARF6 in EGF-signaling
has yet to be elucidated.
Because the underlying molecular mechanisms and
signal transduction pathways related to EGF/EGFRmediated glioma cell proliferation remain poorly understood, the objective of the current study was to elucidate
the role of ARF6 in EGF-induced glioblastoma cell proliferation. In this study, the expression levels of both ARF6
and EGFR were determined in healthy individuals, in
patients with glioma, and in various glioma cell lines using
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) or Western blot analysis. Molecular tools, including
small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), specific chemical
inhibitors, and a recombinant adenovirus carrying an
ARF6 dominant-negative mutant, also were used to elucidate how EGF may regulate ARF6 expression and, eventually, glioma cell proliferation. Results from this study
demonstrate that ARF6 plays an important role in the
EGF/EGFR signaling cascade that leads to glioma cell
proliferation. The function and regulation of this signaling pathway may be of major clinical importance and may
provide new insights for the discovery of novel therapeutic
targets for glioblastoma.

tissue samples were collected from the Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong. The use of these
archival tissues and experimental procedures was
approved by the University of Hong Kong Ethics Committee. U87, U138, U373, SW1088, and SW1783 cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, Va), and LN308 cells were a gift
from Dr. M. E. Hegi (University Hospital Lausanne,
Lausanne, Switzerland). Cell lines were maintained in either minimal essential medium (U87, U138, U373,
LN308, and SW1088 cells) or Leibovitz L-15 medium
(SW1783 cells) and were supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Information on the grade and tumorigenicity of the cell lines was obtained from ATCC (available at:
http://www.atcc.org/).

Measurement of Messenger RNA Levels by
Semiquantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from glioma tissue samples,
from U87 cells, from EGF-treated U87 cells, and from
EGF-treated U87 cells that were preincubated with various inhibitors (actinomycin D, emetine, PD153035,
U0126, LY294002, AG490, or mithramycin A) using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). RT-PCR was
performed using the Superscript Preamplification System
(Invitrogen) with PCR conditions set as follows: 30 cycles
for 45 seconds at 94 C, 30 seconds at 55 C, and 1 minute
at 72 C for 30 cycles (for ARF6 and EGFR) or 26 cycles
(for
glyceraldehyde

[GAPDH] and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP],
which were used as an internal controls). The following

containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2 mM ethylene
glycol-bis-(b-aminoethyl ether)-tetraacetic acid, 2% Triton (volume/volume), and 1% NP-40 (volume/volume)
supplemented with proteinase/phosphatase inhibitors
(aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) for 30 minutes on
ice. Protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA Protein Standard Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 500 lg of the
total lysates with 2 lg of a specific antithreonine-phosphorylation SP1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on
a rotator at 4 C overnight. Immunocomplexes were then
captured with Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). After washing with lysis buffer 3 times, the immunoprecipitates were
resuspended in electrophoresis buffer and analyzed by
Western blot analysis.

Western Blot Analysis
Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM TrisHCl [pH 7.4]; 1% NP-40; 0.25% Na-deoxycholate;
150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; 1 lg/mL aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 1 mM Na3VO4; and 1 mM NaF). Protein extracts
were collected after centrifugation at 10,000g for 15
minutes at 4 C, and the concentration was determined
using the BCA Protein Standard Assay kit (Pierce).
Twenty micrograms of each sample were loaded onto
polyacrylamide gels and were separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Then,
the samples were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Mass). The membrane was
incubated for 1 hour with a primary mouse antibody
against ARF6, SP1, b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, AKT, or phospho-AKT
(Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). The membrane was
washed 3 times PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and then incubated for 1 hour with a rabbit antimouse horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The membrane was washed again in PBS
with 0.1% Tween-20, and the results were observed using
enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).

CUCAU-30 and 50 -AUGAGGAUCCGCAUUUCCU30 ) were designed; chemically synthesized; and purified by
Invitrogen. An siRNA duplex that targeted luciferase
(siLuc) (50 -ACAUCACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA30 and 50 -UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGUGAUGU30 ) and another siRNA with a sequence identical to that of
siARF6-1 except for the 5-nucleotide mismatch
(msiARF6-1) indicated in italics (50 -AGCUGCUAGAU
AUUAUCAAUGACCG-30 and 50 -CGGUCAUUGAU
AAUAUCUAGCAGCU-30 ), also were synthesized and
were used as negative controls (Invitrogen). The siRNA
that targeted SP1 (siSP1) was obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Cells cultured in growth medium were
transfected with 200 nM oligonucleotide duplexes using
Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection, the cells were
allowed to recover for 12 hours, maintained in serum-free
medium for another 24 hours, and then treated with
EGF. The number of viable cells was then determined at
24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after EGF stimulation
by trypan blue exclusion assay.

Recombinant Adenovirus Infection
The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged pXS-ARF6(T27N)
plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. J. G. Donaldson
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National
Institutes of Health). Recombinant tetracycline-regulated adenovirus (Adv) carrying the HA-tagged
dominant-negative mutant ARF6(T27N) (Adv-HAARF6[T27N]) was produced as described previously.16
Recombinant adenovirus carrying the LacZ gene (AdvLacZ) was prepared in parallel as a control. A multiplicity of infection of 90 to 100 was used for recombinant Adv-HA-ARF6(T27N) infection, and 2 ng/mL
doxycycline were used to partially repress ARF6
production.

Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay
Trypan blue exclusion assay was performed to determine
the effect of EGF on glioblastoma cell proliferation. Eight
thousand U87 or U373 cells were seeded in each well of a
48-well plate. Twelve hours after siRNA transfection
(siARF6-1, siARF6-2, or siLuc) or Adv infection (AdvHA-ARF6[T27N] or Adv-LacZ), cells were starved of
serum for 24 hours. Then, the cells were incubated with
or without 50 ng/mL EGF. At 24 hours, 48 hours, and
72 hours after EGF incubation, the total number of viable
cells per well was determined by trypan blue dye (0.4%)
with the use of a hemocytometer (Sigma Chemical
Company, St. Louis, Mo).

Statistical Analysis
The results are expressed as mean  standard deviation
values. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test, and P < .05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Both ARF6 Levels and EGFR Messenger
RNA Levels Were Elevated in Glioma
Tissues
In this study, the mRNA expression levels of ARF6 and
EGFR were detected in 16 high-grade samples (grade 3
and 4) and in 6 low-grade glioma samples (grade 1 and 2)
by using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Because GFAP is a
well known marker of astroglia, both GAPDH and GFAP
were used as internal controls. The protein expression
levels of ARF6 and EGFR in 6 glioma/glioblastoma cell
lines (U87, U138, U373, LN308, SW1088, and
SW1783) also were determined by Western blot analysis.
ARF6 mRNA expression was significantly higher in 13 of
16 high-grade glioma tissues (81%) and in 2 of 6 lowgrade glioma tissues (33%) compared with normal brain
tissues (Fig. 1). EGFR mRNA expression also was
significantly higher in 14 of 16 high-grade glioma tissues
(88%) and in all 6 low-grade glioma tissues (Figs. 1A and
1B). Moreover, both ARF6 and EGFR were expressed
in all 6 glioma cell lines with different grades and
tumorigenicity (Fig. 1C).

Expression of ARF6 Was Up-Regulated by
EGF in a Time-Dependent
and Dose-Dependent Manner
Next, we investigated the effect of EGF on ARF6 expression using RT-PCR. ARF6 expression was up-regulated
in U87 cells upon treatment with EGF (Fig. 2A). Such
expression reached the maximum level (ie, 3-fold increase)
after 6 hours of induction. A dose-response experiment
also demonstrated that such ARF6 expression could reach
the highest level at 50 ng/mL EGF (Fig. 2B). To determine whether EGF was capable of up-regulating ARF6
expression in other glioma cell lines, similar experiments
were repeated using U118, U138, and U373 cells, and all
of them produced a significant increase in ARF6 expression after EGF treatment (Fig. 2C). Because the highest
level of ARF6 expression was detected at 50 ng/mL EGF,
this concentration was chosen as the EGF concentration
in the subsequent experiments.
EGF-Induced ARF6 Expression Is Caused
by Increased Transcription
To determine whether EGF-induced ARF6 expression is
regulated at the transcriptional level, U87 cells were
treated with actinomycin D (a transcriptional inhibitor;
5 lg/mL) or with emetine (a de novo protein synthesis
inhibitor; 100 nM) for 1 hour before EGF treatment.
Upon stimulation with EGF for either 6 hours or 12
hours, actinomycin D prevented the EGF-mediated
up-regulation of ARF6, whereas no effect was observed in
emetine-treated samples (Fig. 2D). These results indicate
that EGF enhances ARF6 expression at the transcriptional
level, and that enhancing effect is independent of de novo
protein synthesis.
EGF-Mediated ARF6 Induction Through
EGFR and Through the MAPK/ERK and
PI3K Signaling Pathways
To determine whether EGF-induced ARF6 expression is
mediated by EGFR, EGF-treated U87 cells were preincubated with 10 lM PD153035 (a specific inhibitor for the
EGFR tyrosine kinase).17 Then, the mRNA and protein
levels of ARF6 in U87 cells with different combinations
of EGF and PD153035 were determined by RT-PCR
and Western blot analysis, respectively (Fig. 3A). The pro4964

tein levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and total ERK1/2
also were examined in parallel. Our results indicated that
PD153035 treatment blocks EGF-mediated ARF6 induction at both the transcriptional and translational levels,
suggesting that EGFR tyrosine kinase activation is
required for such induction.
Upon EGF binding, EGFR triggers numerous
downstream signaling cascades, including the MEK/ERK,
PI3K, and signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (Stat3) pathways.18 Therefore, the downstream signaling of EGFR that leads to ARF6 up-regulation also was
investigated using specific inhibitors. U87 cells were pretreated with U0126 (an MEK inhibitor; 20 lM),
LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K; 20 lM), and AG490
(an inhibitor of JAK-2; 50 lM) for 1 hour before EGF
treatment. We observed that both U0126 and LY294002
abrogated EGF-induced ARF6 mRNA expression (Figs.
3B and 3C, left). U0126 was able to abolish EGF-induced
ARF6 protein expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Fig. 3B, right). LY294002 was able to prevent EGFinduced ARF6 protein expression concurrently with AKT
phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, right). However, AG490 failed
to inhibit EGF-induced ARF6 up-regulation at both the
transcriptional and translational levels (data not shown),
indicating that JAK-2 is not involved in this process. In
the absence of EGF, none of these inhibitors had a significant effect on ARF6 protein expression (Figs. 3A-3C,
right). To further confirm our data, we also treated U373
cells with PD153035, U0126, LY294002, or AG490
before EGF induction. Similar to U87 cells, we observed
that PD153035, U0126, and LY294002 were able to suppress ARF6 expression in U373 cells (data not shown).
These results indicate that both the MEK/ERK signaling
pathway and the PI3K signaling pathway are required for
EGF-mediated ARF6 induction.

Downstream of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K

Lebeda et al previously reported that the ARF6 promoter
is guanine and cytosine (GC)-rich and contains potential
SP1 binding sites.19 Therefore, we speculated that SP1
may participate in EGF-induced ARF6 expression. First,

drug that blocks the activity of SP1 family members by
binding to GC-rich regions,20 for 1 hour and then incubated with EGF for 6 hours. Mithramycin A significantly
inhibited ARF6 expression in the presence of EGF
(Fig. 4A). In another experiment in which SP1 protein
expression was suppressed by an siRNA that targeted SP1
(siSP1), ARF6 expression was reduced markedly
(Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that SP1 is necessary for
EGF-induced ARF6 expression.
Because threonine phosphorylation has been implicated in regulating SP1 transcriptional activity,21,22 we
hypothesized that EGF may enhance SP1 protein
phosphorylation. To investigate the effect of EGF on
SP1, protein extracts of untreated, EGF-treated, EGF/
U0126-treated, or EGF/LY294002-treated U87 cells
were immunoprecipitated using SP1 antibody and subsequently analyzed by Western blot analysis using an antithreonine-phosphorylation SP1 antibody. Our results
demonstrated that EGF increased the level of threoninephosphorylated SP1, whereas such up-regulation was
sensitive to U0126 or LY294002 treatment (Fig. 4C).
Collectively, our data suggest that EGF induces SP1 phosphorylation through both ERK and AKT activation. In
addition, SP1 plays an important role in EGF-induced
ARF6 expression and is a downstream target of the MEK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.

ARF6 Is Required for EGF-Stimulated
Glioma Cell Proliferation in Vitro
We observed that EGF/EGFR signaling regulated the
proliferation of human glioma cells.23 To determine
whether ARF6 affects EGF-mediated glioma cell proliferation, U87 cells were transfected with siRNAs that
targeted ARF6 (siARF6-1 or siARF6-2), with an siRNA
that targeted luciferase (siLuc), or with a mismatched
siRNA (msiARF6-1). ARF6 mRNA levels in U87 and
U373 cells were reduced significantly by siARF6-1
(Fig. 5A). At 48 hours and 72 hours after EGF stimulation, the number of siLuc-transfected or msiARF6-1–
transfected U87 cells increased significantly (Fig. 5A,
bottom left). However, in the absence or presence of
EGF, ARF6 knockdown by siARF6-1 or siARF6-2 transfection neither affected U87 cell proliferation nor induced
significant cell death. Similar results also were obtained
from U373 cells (Fig. 5A, bottom right).

To further confirm the role of ARF6 in EGFinduced glioma cell proliferation, U87 or U373 cells were
transduced with recombinant adenovirus carrying either
the HA-tagged ARF6 dominant-negative mutant (AdvHA-ARF6[T27N]) or the control LacZ gene (Adv-LacZ),
and the expression of HA-ARF6(T27N) protein was
detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B, top). At 48
hours and 72 hours after EGF treatment, we observed
that the number of Adv-LacZ–infected cells increased significantly (Fig. 5B, left). In contrast, Adv-HAARF6(T27N) infection markedly inhibited EGF-induced
cell proliferation. Similar results were obtained from
U373 cells (Fig. 5B, right). These results suggest that
EGF-stimulated glioma cell proliferation depends on
ARF6.

DISCUSSION
The current results demonstrate that ARF6 plays an important role in EGF-induced glioma cell proliferation.
Our findings also support the possibility that EGFinduced glioma cell proliferation may involve SP1induced ARF6 up-regulation at the transcriptional level
through the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, as illustrated in Figure 6.
In this study, first, we demonstrated that EGF was
able to up-regulate the mRNA expression of ARF6 in
human glioblastoma U87 cells in a time-dependent and
dose-dependent manner. The EGF-induced ARF6
expression depended on both the MEK/ERK signaling
pathway and the PI3K signaling pathway, because specific
chemical inhibitors for these pathways caused the partial
inhibition of EGF-mediated ARF6 up-regulation. It is
likely that EGF may act on 2 parallel and distinct signaling pathways to induce ARF6 expression, because none of
the chemical inhibitors that we used could completely
abrogate the EGF-induced ARF6 expression. Furthermore, SP1 was required for such induction, because exposure to the SP1 inhibitor mithramycin A and to siSP1
markedly reduced ARF6 expression. When either the
PI3K pathway or the MEK/ERK pathway was blocked,
EGF-induced SP1 phosphorylation was reduced markedly, suggesting that SP1 is involved in the downstream
signaling of both pathways.
Our data supported the concept that EGF/EGFR is
capable of inducing ARF6 expression through the PI3K/

small-interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased ARF6 protein expression. siRNA targeting SP1 (siRNA-SP1 [siSP1], 200 nM) and luciferase
(siRNA-luciferase [siLuc], 200 nM) were transfected separately into U87 cells, and the expression of ARF6 and SP1 proteins was
detected using Western blot analysis. The relative band intensities were measured using densitometry and were normalized against
the respective b-actin signals. An asterisk indicates P < .05 for siSP1-transfected cells versus siLuc-transfected cells. (C) SP1 was phosphorylated by EGF through the MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling pathways. U87 cells were treated with vehicle, EGF, EGF/U0126 (an MEK

with the SP1 antibody and analyzed by Western blot analysis using specific antithreonine-phosphorylated antibodies. Total SP1 was
used as a control for equal loading. The relative band intensities of threonine-phosphorylated (phospho-threonine) SP1 (phospho-SP1)
were measured using densitometry and were normalized against the respective total SP1 signals. Data are presented as the mean 

AKT and MEK/ERK pathways, and this process is associated with glioblastoma cell proliferation. This conclusion
is in line with previous data demonstrating that the
EGFRvIII promotes tumor growth and progression
through constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway24-;28 and the MAPK/ERK1/2 signal-transduction
pathway.29 The observation that ARF6 down-regulation
by siRNA or by the ARF6 dominant-negative mutant
could significantly inhibit EGF-induced cell proliferation
also is consistent with the results from a previous study by
Ikeda et al, who reported a correlation between ARF6 protein expression and cell numbers in vascular endothelial
growth factor-stimulated endothelial cells.30
Upon EGF binding, EGFR initiates a series of biochemical events. The duration and strength of these signals are tightly regulated by the internalization of
activated EGFR receptors and their subsequent degradation within late endosomal/lysosomal compartments.31
This process requires 2 sorting steps that are controlled by
2 different clathrin-dependent mechanisms: 1) ligandinduced internalization from the plasma membrane
4970

through clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) and vesicles (CCVs),
2) and ubiquitination-dependent delivery into internal
endosomal vesicles.32 The internalized receptors first are
transported to early endosomes, which subsequently
become late endosomes and multivesicular bodies.
EGFRs then undergo sorting in these subcellular compartments and are either recycled back to the plasma
membrane or destroyed in lysosomes.33 Recent studies
have demonstrated that other small G proteins, particularly the Ras analog in brain (Rab) small GTPases, such as
Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11, may be involved in endocytic
trafficking of the EGF/EGFR complex by regulating its
lysosomal degradation and recycling.34,35 Therefore, it is
possible that ARF6, as a small G protein that takes part in
membrane trafficking,10 may increase the rate of EGFR
recycling and, hence, the activation of the MEK/ERK and
PI3K pathways and glioblastoma cell proliferation.
ARF6 GTPases are crucial for assembling coat proteins during vesicle formation.36 Two previous studies
have revealed that ARF6 could stimulate clathrin/AP-2
recruitment to cell membranes, and the constitutively
active ARF6 mutant, Q67L, could promote clathrin and
AP-2 recruitment. However, the ARF6 dominant-negative mutant (T27N) failed to facilitate protein binding to
the cell membrane.37,38 Because the formation of both
CCPs and CCVs involves the recruitment of clathrin and
AP-2 adaptor complexes to the cytoplasmic surface of the
donor membrane,39 we speculate that ARF6 may be
essential for internalization of the EGFR-EGF complex.
Further investigations will be necessary to clarify this
issue.
In addition, promoting the recruitment of adaptor
proteins and vesicular intracellular traffic, ARF6 also takes
part in membrane/endosome trafficking. For example,
ARF6 reportedly is involved in the endocytosis and desensitization of G-protein–coupled receptors.40 Therefore, it
is possible that EGF-mediated up-regulation of ARF6
may promote CCP or CCV formation by recruiting their
various components (ie, clathrin and the AP-2 complex).
Thus, ARF6 up-regulation may promote the endocytic
trafficking of the EGF/EGFR complex, which may be
responsible in part for stimulating glioblastoma cell
proliferation. Moreover, ARF6 also may function in
EGFR trafficking and recycling in a manner similar to the
Rab GTPases, thereby promoting the growth signals for
glioblastoma cells.

ARF6 in EGF-Induced Glioblastoma/Li et al

In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate that ARF6 expression in glioma cells is up-regulated by EGF through 2 parallel but independent
pathways, PI3K and MAPK. In addition, ARF6 is
required for EGF-induced glioma cell proliferation; therefore, it may represent a novel therapeutic target for
glioblastoma.
