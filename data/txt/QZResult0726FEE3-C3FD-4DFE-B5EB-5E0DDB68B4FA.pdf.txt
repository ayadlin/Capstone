Abstract
Androgen-dependent pathways regulate maintenance and growth of normal and malignant prostate tissues.
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) exploits this dependence and is used to treat metastatic prostate cancer;
however, regression initially seen with ADT gives way to development of incurable castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). Although ADT generates a therapeutic response, it is also associated with a pattern of metabolic
alterations consistent with metabolic syndrome including elevated circulating insulin. Because CRPC cells are
capable of synthesizing androgens de novo, we hypothesized that insulin may also influence steroidogenesis in
CRPC. In this study, we examined this hypothesis by evaluating the effect of insulin on steroid synthesis in
prostate cancer cell lines. Treatment with 10 nmol/L insulin increased mRNA and protein expression of
steroidogenesis enzymes and upregulated the insulin receptor substrate insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2).
Similarly, insulin treatment upregulated intracellular testosterone levels and secreted androgens, with the
concentrations of steroids observed similar to the levels reported in prostate cancer patients. With similar
potency to dihydrotestosterone, insulin treatment resulted in increased mRNA expression of prostate-specific
antigen. CRPC progression also correlated with increased expression of IRS-2 and insulin receptor in vivo. Taken
together, our findings support the hypothesis that the elevated insulin levels associated with therapeutic
castration may exacerbate progression of prostate cancer to incurable CRPC in part by enhancing steroidogenesis. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5754–64. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Organ-confined prostate cancer can be treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy; however, 25% to 40%
of patients will experience biochemical recurrence with an
increase in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
used as a marker of tumor growth, and continue to progress
with metastatic disease (1). The most common therapy for
progression is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) usually
administered by luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone
agonists or antagonists that disrupt the feedback loop
within the hypothalamic gonadal axis to suppress testosterone production from the testes. Initially, inhibition of tes-

ticular androgen causes tumor regression; however, this
remission is temporary, and typically within 24 months
patients recur with an increasing PSA level despite castrate
androgen levels in the serum. This is termed castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and is currently viewed as
incurable (1, 2). The underlying mechanisms for progression
to CRPC are complex; however, we have recently shown that
one major mechanism is that in the face of ADT, prostate
tumors are capable of synthesizing androgens de novo,
reactivating androgen driven processes, and thereby promoting tumor growth (3). This de novo biosynthesis seems to
be further upregulated by androgens, indicating a feedforward loop of steroidogenesis. In the physiologic setting,
the systemic circulating weak androgens derived from the
adrenal gland can also serve as substrates for further conversion to more active androgens within the prostate using
the steroidogenic enzymes shown to be present (2, 4). The
key question remains as to what initiates and augments
steroidogenesis in prostate cancer following castration.
Although ADT provides control of prostate cancer growth,
the systemic noncancer effects include the induction of the
metabolic syndrome with a key consistent feature of hyperinsulinemia (5, 6). We have hypothesized (7, 8) that these high
circulating levels of serum insulin may act directly on prostate
cancer cells and enhance steroidogenic pathways. Herein, we
show that insulin treatment on prostate cancer cells increases
the expression at both the mRNA and protein levels of several

key enzymes involved in de novo steroidogenesis including
cytochrome p450 family members CYP11A1 and CYP17A1,
RDH5, and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD3B2 in LNCaP,
VCaP, and 22RV1 prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, in
LNCaP cells, insulin promotes the translocation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) to the mitochondria, a
rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. We show that synthesis
of steroid hormones, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are increased in prostate cancer cells with
insulin treatment to levels sufficient enough to activate PSA
production. In vivo studies of LNCaP xenografts show
increased expression of insulin receptor, and insulin receptor
substrates are associated with progression to castrate resistance. We conclude from this study that insulin acts directly
on prostate cancer cells to increase de novo androgen synthesis in CRPC.

Materials and Methods
In vitro model
LNCaP cells (passages 36–48; American Type Culture Collection) and 22RV1 cells were cultured in phenol red–free
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
HyClone; Sigma). VCaP cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing
10% FBS. For modeling androgen deprivation, cells were
plated in FBS and changed to 5% charcoal-stripped serum
(CSS; HyClone) media for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours in
serum-free media. Cells were treated with 10 nmol/L insulin
(Sigma) for various times (5, 10, 16, 24, and 48 hours). Insulin
and DHT were refreshed if treatment exceeded 24 hours. Cells
were incubated in the presence of 25 mmol/L bicalutamide or
vehicle control for 2 hours prior to the addition of insulin or
DHT.
Quantitative real time-PCR
RNA was extracted from prostate cancer cells using TRI
Reagent (Applied Biosystems) before reverse transcription
with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequent quantitative PCR was carried out on 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green detection.
Primers (Sigma Proligo) were designed by Primer3 Software
from coding segments of genes obtained from the NCBI data
bank. The primers used were as follows: SREBP [forward (f)]

tive to the vehicle control at the same time point. Data
were analyzed with SDS 2.3 software by means of the
2DDCt method. Experiments were repeated a minimum of
5 times.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(25 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1%
sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), and triplicate wells were
pooled. SDS-PAGE was used to separate proteins (15 mg/lane),
using standard protocols. Blots were visualized using secondary antibodies compatible with LI-COR Odyssey Imager (LICOR Biosciences). Antibodies used were as follows: rabbit
SREBP1, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit StAR and
CYP17A1, 1:1,000 (kind gifts from Dr. D.B. Hales); rabbit
CYP11A1, 1:1,000 (Corgen); goat HSD3B2, 1:200 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); goat SRD5A1, 1:500 (Novus); and RDH5, 1:300
(Abnova); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as
a loading control. Experiments were repeated a minimum of 3
times.
Mitochondrial fractionation assay
MitoSciences cell fractionation kit was used for mitochondrial fractionation of LNCaP cells. GAPDH was used as a
control for mitochondrial isolation.
Steroid quantitation (total steroids) by liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
Steroid analysis was carried out, as previously described
(3). Briefly, cells were grown in 15-cm plates and treated
with 10 nmol/L insulin, as described previously. Two plates
of cells were washed with PBS and pooled to give one
sample. Media were collected and likewise combined for
extraction. Steroids were extracted from the pellet with an
methyl tert-butyl ether/methanol/water extraction for cell
lysates of water-equilibrated ethyl acetate for media, which
was dried down and resuspended in acetonitrile, sonicated,
dried down, and resuspended in 50% methanol, and then
further sonicated and spun to remove any particulates.
Samples were derivatized in 0.2 mol/L hydroxylamine
HCl. Samples were run on a Waters Acquity Liquid Chromatography system and Waters Quattro Premier liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS)
system, identified using standards of known retention times
(Fig. 1), and analyzed using BioLynx Software (Waters
Corporation). Readings were adjusted using cell pellet
weight and normalized to vehicle-treated samples.
De novo steroid analysis using radiometric detection
LNCaP and VCaP cells were grown in 6-well plates and
treated as described previously (9). At the time of insulin
treatment, 6 mCi/mL 14C-acetate (PerkinElmer) was added
to each plate for coincubation. Steroids from 2 mL of
media were extracted with 75:25 hexane/ethanol acetate,
dried down, and resuspended into 75 mL methanol (50%).
Samples were analyzed on the Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC
System and Packard Radiometric Detector 150TR Flow

All animal experimentation was conducted in accordance
with accepted standards of the University of British Columbia
Committee on Animal Care, as described previously (3).
Briefly, LNCaP xenograft tumors were grown in athymic nude
mice at 4 sites. PSA levels were measured weekly from tail vein
serum samples. Six weeks following inoculation of tumors,
mice were castrated. Tumors were harvested from the same
mouse before castration, 8 days after castration corresponding
to a PSA nadir, and 28 days after castration corresponding to
CRPC. Tumors were removed and homogenized in TRIzol
(Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated for cDNA synthesis as
described previously.

Insulin Increases Steroidogenesis in Prostate Cancer Cells

Statistics
Two-tailed Student's t test assuming unequal variance was
used throughout.

Results
Insulin upregulates expression of enzymes necessary
for steroidogenesis at the mRNA and protein levels
A number of interlinked pathways can lead to the production of testosterone and DHT from intracellular cholesterol
synthesis (Fig. 1). The direct effect of insulin on steroidogenesis within prostate cancer cells was initially determined by
quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis to examine
changes in expression of key genes within this pathway
following chronic exposure of insulin. LNCaP cells treated
with 10 nmol/L insulin for 5, 10, and 16 hours showed that
enzymes required for synthesis of androgens were upregulated
at the mRNA level in the presence of insulin after 10 hours
(Fig. 2A). A parallel and significant 3.5-fold increase in IRS-2
(P < 0.05) suggests increased signaling via the insulin receptor
(10). Sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors are responsible for coordinately regulating
the enzymes required for synthesis of cholesterol, importation
of cholesterol into the mitochondria, and steroidogenesis (11–
13). At this time point, SREBP1 mRNA was also increased
(P < 0.05). StAR, which chaperones cholesterol into the
mitochondria, increased 2.25-fold, and CYP11A1 (C11A1),
the rate-limiting enzyme that commits cholesterol to steroid
synthesis, is upregulated 2-fold. Many of the steroidogenic
enzymes catalyze more than 1 step in the pathway to DHT
synthesis. These include monooxygenase CYP17A1 (C17A1),
oxidoreductase/dehydrogenases HSD3B2, HSD17B3, and
5-a-reductase (SRD5A1). CYP17A1 was significantly increased
by 3.7-fold (P < 0.05), HSD3B2 showed a significant 1.5-fold
increase with insulin (P < 0.05), and HSD17B3 was upregulated
approximately 7.5-fold (P ¼ 0.11), whereas aldo-keto reductase
(AKR)1C3 remained unchanged (data not shown). SRD5A1,
the enzyme responsible for conversion of testosterone to DHT,
showed a significant 30% increase from base level. In the
"backdoor" pathway of steroidogenesis (14), RDH5 converts
androstenediol directly to DHT and was 2-fold upregulated
(P < 0.05) with 10 nmol/L insulin.
These studies were extended into other prostate cancer cell
lines with functional androgen receptors (AR), VCaP and
22RV1s. The single time point 48 hours was used to allow
simultaneous assessment of accumulated steroids synthesized de novo. Similarly to LNCaP cells, increased mRNA in
VCaP cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 2B) was observed for CYP11A1 (3fold), CYP17A1 (1.5-fold), HSD17B3 (2.5-fold), and RDH5 (1.5fold). SREBP and StAR were expressed but were not significantly changed with insulin (Fig. 2B). In 22RV1 cells, similar
increases in mRNA were shown (Fig. 2C). SREBP and StAR
were upregulated 2-fold (P < 0.05), whereas CYP11A1 was
increased approximately 3-fold. CYP17A1 was upregulated 5fold, whereas HSD3B2 and HSD17B3 increased 2.3- and 2-fold,
respectively (P < 0.05). RDH5 increased 2.6-fold (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2C). There was no significant change in IRS-2 expression
in VCaP or 22RV1 cells by insulin at 48 hours.

The 3 cell lines tested are androgen responsive and derived
from prostate cancer patient metastases. However, their
response to differing stimuli is variable and likely underpinned
by differences in genomics and other molecular characteristics of the lesions (15, 16). Although the magnitude and
temporal upregulation of steroidogenesis enzyme mRNA in
these cells may differ, posttranslational modifications and
subcellular localization also influence their activity. Importantly, all enzymes necessary for steroidogenesis are expressed
in various prostate cancer cell lines.
We have previously shown that prostate cancer cells can
use alternative steroidogenic pathways in a compensatory
manner to synthesize DHT through the classical pathway,
"backdoor" pathway, or a combination of both (17). Furthermore, many of the enzymes in the steroidogenesis pathway
can function bidirectionally, permitting alternative pathways
of steroid synthesis (18).
Protein levels of steroidogenic enzymes were increased in
LNCaP cells following insulin treatment (Fig. 2D). Specifically,
the protein levels of CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 were significantly
increased 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively (P < 0.05). Levels of
HSD3B2 protein increased 3.6-fold but did not reach statistical
significance. SRD5A, although modestly increased following
10-hour insulin treatment at the mRNA level, it increased
greater than 3-fold at the protein level (P < 0.05) and showed
elevated expression (1.5- and 2-fold at 10 and 16 hours,
respectively; data not shown). RDH5 protein was only upregulated by insulin at the 10-hour time point (P < 0.05), and
HSD17B3 was not significantly increased until 16-hour insulin
treatment (P < 0.05), with steady expression at 5 and 10 hours
(not shown). AKRIC3 protein levels were unchanged; however,
AKR1C3 is the predominant AKR in prostate epithelial cells,
and it is possible that the activity of the enzyme is regulated
posttranslationally, without exceptional change to protein
levels. It is important to note that AKR1C3 was expressed
in all cell lines investigated. In 22RV1 cells, the profile of
upregulated enzymes was similar to LNCaPs (Fig. 2E), with
significant increases in SREBP, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and
HSD17B3 (P < 0.05).
Although our data suggest that insulin increases StAR
expression, biologically the more important effect is altered
at subcellular localization of StAR. Our data show a 1.7-fold
increase in StAR translocation into the mitochondria following 16-hour treatment with insulin in LNCaP cells (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2F).
Insulin increases intracellular steroids in prostate
cancer cells
To determine whether there is a parallel increase in steroid
synthesis, we used high-performance liquid chromatography–
mass spectrometry to measure total steroid content of LNCaP
cells following 16-hour insulin treatment. Insulin dramatically
increased intracellular LNCaP steroid levels (Fig. 3A), with 2.5fold increased levels of pregnenolone, the first steroid converted from cholesterol in the pathway (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). We
observed a 15-fold increase in total intracellular 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OH-progesterone) levels (P < 0.05), which is
converted from progesterone by CYP17A1, an enzyme shown

Figure 3. Insulin increases steroid production in prostate cancer cells. LNCaP cells were treated with 10 nmol/L insulin for 16 hours, and steroids were
extracted. Intracellular steroids were identified by LC/MS-MS and quantitated (A), showing a significant increase in pregnenolone, 17-OH-progesterone
(17-OH P), DHEA, and testosterone (T). B, extracellular steroids extracted from media were analyzed. Significantly increased levels of androstenedione (Andr),
17-OH-progesterone (17-OH P), DHT, and testosterone (T) were shown. Pregnenolone (Preg) was increased but did not reach significance. Steroid levels were
adjusted to cell pellet weight, and recovery of denatured testosterone was used to calculate extraction efficiency. Results were compared with vehicle control.
De novo steroid synthesis was measured by incubating cells with 6 mCi/mL radiolabeled acetate. C, increased 14C-labeled steroid peaks were measured in
insulin-treated versus control media samples after 72 hours with significant increases in testosterone, androstenedione, androsterone, and pregnan-3,20dione. VCaP cells were also measured (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). D, DHT was measured by ELISA in media collected from 22RV1 cells after

in Figure 2 to be significantly increased with insulin.
CYP17A1 also catalyzes the final reaction in the synthesis
of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which was substantially
increased 18-fold by insulin (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). Notably,
testosterone levels were increased approximately 60-fold in
LNCaP cells following treatment with insulin (P < 0.05).
Intracellular levels of testosterone were calculated to
increase from approximately 0.011 to 0.65 ng/g cells following 10 nmol/L insulin for 16 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and C). These levels are consistent with the testosterone
levels of our previous findings (3). Gregory and colleagues
have shown that DHT concentrations as low as 1  1014
mol/L (2.92  106 ng/g) to transactivate AR in prostate
cancer cell lines (19), and Titus and colleagues report 1.25
pmol/g tissue (0.498 ng/g) of DHT in recurrent prostate
cancer tissue specimens (20). Mostaghel found DHT levels in
castrate patients to be 0.2 to 1.78 ng/g (4); therefore, the
androgen concentrations detected in our study were consistent with levels needed for AR activation.

Insulin increases secretion of steroids from prostate
cancer cells
As steroidogenic cells differentially secrete specific steroids,
we measured steroid levels in the media of prostate cancer
cells cultured in serum-free media versus media supplemented with 10 nmol/L insulin for 16 hours. As expected, it was
steroids in the latter part of the steroidogenic pathway that
appeared in the media (Fig. 3B). Of greatest significance, 17OH-progesterone was 2-fold increased (P < 0.05), testosterone
1.3-fold and DHT 1.5-fold increased (P < 0.05), and androstenedione was increased 3-fold (P < 0.05).
Importantly, these data indicate that insulin-stimulated
intracellular steroidogenesis by prostate cancer cells could
provide steroids, including androgens, to the tumor microenvironment. Concentrations of DHT and testosterone
secreted into the media by LNCaP cells after 16 hours of
insulin treatment in our studies were calculated to be
approximately 0.0249 and 0.037 nmol/L (Supplementary
Fig. S1B and C), with baseline levels consistent with our

previous studies (3) and within the range necessary to
activate AR (19, 20).
To investigate de novo steroidogenesis, LNCaP and VCaP
cells were treated with 14C-labeled acetate in the presence or
absence of insulin for 72 hours before radiometric analysis of
cell culture medium. Increased steroids in samples treated
with insulin compared with vehicle control were consistent
with steady-state data from LNCaP cells. In LNCaPs (Fig. 3C),
we showed significant increases in testosterone (2-fold,
P < 0.05), androstenedione (1.5-fold, P < 0.05), androsterone
(2-fold, P < 0.05), and pregnan-3,20-dione (1.7-fold, P < 0.05), as
well as several other peaks within the steroid region that did
not correspond to Mix 10 standards (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and B) including a 34-minute peak with a retention time
between progesterone and pregnan-3,20-dione, which was
significantly increased (2.4-fold, P < 0.05). Steroid peaks were
significantly increased in VCaP extracts following insulin
treatment as well as a 4-fold increase in cholesterol (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Furthermore, steroids beyond
androstenedione and androsterone in the pathways were
not detected in VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B),
suggesting that rates of steroid synthesis differ between the
cell lines. In 22RV1 cells, DHT secretion into the media was
significantly increased from 0.23 to 0.36 nmol/L (Fig. 3D)
following 48-hour treatment with 10 nmol/L insulin. This is
comparable with DHT secreted by LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S1) and sufficient to activate the AR (19, 20).
PSA expression and secretion are increased by insulin
Serum PSA is the biomarker for prostate cancer recurrence
and for progression to CRPC following ADT. We and others
have shown that a key mechanism underlying CRPC progression is the activation of androgen-driven pathways through
the AR (21, 22); therefore, we have used PSA as a functional
surrogate of AR reactivation via increased androgen production. A direct comparison of insulin stimulation of PSA with
DHT was made with LNCaP cells exposed to 10 nmol/L insulin
or 10 nmol/L DHT for 16, 24, or 48 hours. Insulin treatment (24
hours) induced a 10-fold increase in PSA mRNA (Fig. 4A),
compared with a 20-fold increase by DHT, whereas mRNA
levels decreased by 48 hours, likely due to the metabolism of
these hormones. In contrast, the nonmetabolizable androgen
R1881 continued to increase PSA mRNA levels over this time
course (Fig. 4B). Levels of response were compared between 10
nmol/L insulin and increasing concentrations of DHT. At 24
hours, PSA induction by 10 nmol/L insulin was equivalent to
the level of induction seen with approximately 0.16 (0.29)
nmol/L DHT (Fig. 4C), calculated by linear regression. Mean
concentration of PSA with vehicle did not change over time
(data not shown). PSA secreted into the media was increased
because of insulin treatment after 16 hours (Fig. 4C), which
suggests a lag in PSA response consistent with requisite
steroid production. These data clearly show that PSA was
increased at 16 hours and significantly accumulated in the
media by 48 hours to 1.8-fold of baseline following insulin
exposure (P < 0.05). This is supported by data showing
sustained intracellular androgen levels by insulin at 48 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). Insulin increased PSA expres-

sion in VCaP cells by 40% from baseline (P < 0.05) after 24
hours (Fig. 4E) and 2-fold 22RV1 cells at 48 hours (Fig. 4F).
Treatment with the AR antagonist bicalutamide attenuated
the insulin induced increase in PSA expression in LNCaP and
22RV1 cells (Fig. 4G and H), directly implicating that insulin
activation is mediated by the AR.
In LNCaP xenografts, mice that showed an increase in
both PSA and RDH5 expression at 28 days
postcastration also displayed an increase in insulin
receptor isoform A and IRS-2 mRNA
CRPC progression can be modeled in vivo using LNCaP
tumors injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised
male mice; tumor growth is followed by monitoring tumorderived PSA levels in the serum. Typically, after a 6-week
period of growth, the mice are castrated and PSA levels fall to a
nadir within 7 days. In most mice, PSA levels begin to increase
again by day 28 postcastration and this is referred to as
castrate resistance in this model. However, in some mice
there is a greater lag of PSA production not arising until after
35 days. In a blinded study for PSA level following castration,
tumors were grown for 28 days postcastration and then
analyzed for the expression of markers relevant to steroidogenesis. From the isolated LNCaP tumors, qRT-PCR was
carried out for PSA, insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A), IRS-2,
and RDH5. RDH5 is a key enzyme of the backdoor pathway
to DHT synthesis, and tumors expressing this enzyme may
be more steroidogenic (3, 14). In mice that exhibited
increased serum PSA levels 28 days following castration,
tumors showed significantly higher gene expression levels of
PSA, RDH5, and IRS-2 (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A), and IR-A showed a
trend toward increased expression (Fig. 5A). In contrast,
these genes were unchanged in mice bearing LNCaP tumors
that did not show an increase in serum PSA levels by 28 days
(nonprogressed; Fig. 5B). Therefore, increased steroidogenesis correlates to increased androgen activation (PSA production) in vivo. Changes in key insulin signaling molecules
suggest that insulin may act via IR-A and IRS-2 in this
model.

Discussion
Reactivation of the AR following ADT, defined by rising
serum PSA levels is a hallmark of CRPC progression. Several
mechanisms including hypersensitivity of the receptor to
low steroid concentrations and ligand promiscuity arising
from mutations in the receptor ligand–binding domain can
play a role in AR reactivation (19, 22). We and others have
previously identified that intratumoral androgen production
is also associated with the activation of AR (20). We have
shown that LNCaP, VCaP, and 22RV1 prostate cancer cell
lines express the enzymes required for de novo androgen
synthesis (3). Following ADT, androgen levels continue to be
substantial in prostate tissue compared with the dramatic
decrease of androgens in sera. These low levels are sufficient
to activate AR (2, 3). These studies indicate that androgen
synthesis plays an important role in CRPC progression;
however, the biological factors inducing and regulating

steroidogenesis during prostate cancer progression have not
been largely explored.
ADT is associated with the development of metabolic
syndrome including an increase in fat mass and fasting plasma
insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia refs. 6, 23). Emerging evidence
suggests that both body mass index and high serum insulin
levels are independently predictive of poorer patient outcomes including increased disease aggression and increased
cancer mortality (24); obese men are more likely to have
higher grade cancers, high recurrence rates, and high prostate
cancer–specific mortality (25). Recent studies have specifically
identified a correlation between elevated C-peptide levels, a
surrogate measure of insulin levels, with high-grade prostate
cancer and worse patient prognosis (6, 7, 24, 26, 27). Major
findings from recent studies of men receiving ADT showed a
relationship between elevated C-peptide levels and more rapid
progression to castrate resistance (28, 29), suggesting a role for
insulin in disease progression. Diet-induced hyperinsulinemia
leads to more aggressive tumor growth in mice (8), and insulin
is known to stimulate proliferation in breast and prostate
cancer cells (30, 31). In contrast, men with low insulin levels
due to diabetes seem to have a decreased risk of prostate
cancer development (32, 33). Increased insulin receptor
expression has recently been shown in neoplastic prostate

5762

specimens (7), suggesting increased insulin signaling in these
cells.
Although there is mounting epidemiologic evidence linking
hyperinsulinemia and CRPC, the direct action of insulin on
prostate cancer cells has not been investigated. Insulin is can
promote steroidogenesis through upregulation of steroidogenic enzymes (34–36) in conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, and increased expression of insulin receptors
have been reported on prostate cancer cell lines and prostate
tumor tissue (7). The ability of prostate cell lines to produce
steroids has been shown (3, 35, 37–39). Therefore, we investigated whether insulin plays a role in prostate cancer progression through the promotion of de novo steroidogenesis.
We show for the first time that insulin upregulates steroidogenesis in AR-responsive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP,
VCaP, and 22RV1, leading to increased cell survival and
exacerbating CRPC progression.
We have shown that RNA and protein for many enzymes
required for steroidogenesis, via both the classical and backdoor pathways, are upregulated following insulin treatment.
Expression of the insulin signaling molecule IRS-2 is significantly increased at the RNA level in LNCaPs; increased
expression of IRS-2 has been associated with increased steroidogenesis in both ovarian thecal and breast cancer cells (40,
41). Importantly, we have shown an increase in expression of
mRNA and protein for SREBP, the transcription factor that is
responsible for coordinating the initiation of cholesterol
synthesis in LNCaP cells following 10-hour insulin treatment
and 48-hour treatment of 22RV1 cells. CYP11A1 was increased
in all cell types and StAR in LNCaPs and 22RV1s; these
enzymes are responsible for importation of cholesterol into
the mitochondria for pregnenolone conversion and commitment to steroidogenesis. The enzymes that catalyze more than
1 step in the steroidogenesis pathway including CYP17A1,
HSD3B2, HSD17B3, and SRD5A1 (Fig. 1) were all significantly
upregulated by insulin treatment. Significantly increased
expression of SRD5A1 was seen in LNCaP cells only but
RDH5 expression was increased in all cell lines; these enzymes
convert testosterone and androstenediol into DHT, respectively. Taken together, our data suggest that both pathways of
de novo androgen synthesis are upregulated in prostate cancer
cells following insulin treatment, allowing for versatile means
of androgen synthesis as seen in our previous studies (17).
Insulin consistently stimulated an increase in intracellular
steroids and steroids released into the media including androgens in all cell lines, indicating that the enzymes are functionally active. The release of steroids by prostate cancer cells
may provide paracrine activity of steroids within the microenvironment. Rising PSA levels following ADT is considered
the sentinel for CRPC progression most likely driven by AR
reactivation. We observed increased PSA mRNA expression in
all 3 cell lines by insulin, which shows that there is adequate
AR activation to stimulate PSA expression (3, 22, 42) and this
can be inhibited by bicalutamide treatment. An increase in
structurally related steroids may still be relevant in cancer
progression, in the cases wherein AR has acquired mutations,
leading to promiscuous activation by steroids and compounds
other than testosterone and DHT (15), for example, the

Insulin Increases Steroidogenesis in Prostate Cancer Cells

mutation of the LNCaP AR ligand–binding domain (T877A)
can be activated by nonandrogenic steroids (15).
In summary, our research has shown that insulin increases
steroidogenesis in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines by
increasing the mRNA and protein levels of steroidogenic
enzymes and increases steroid production, including androgens. Subsequent increased PSA secretion suggests that insulin can affect prostate cancer cell survival and CRPC
progression. Increased expression of the insulin receptor in
the LNCaP xenograft model during progression to castrate
resistance provides further evidence that insulin may be
increasing signaling in prostate cancer cells through increased
insulin receptor. There are multiple studies correlating high
insulin levels and prostate cancer progression (8, 23, 27, 32,
43). The significance of cholesterol synthesis (steroid precursor) and steroidogenesis in prostate cancer progression suggests that treatments that target these pathways are pertinent
for the treatment of CRPC patients, particularly in the context
of hyperinsulinemia and the metabolic syndrome (3, 4, 9, 22,
37–39, 42, 44). Abiraterone, an inhibitor of CYP17A1, has
shown promising results in clinical trials with men who are
no longer responsive to ADT (45). This is one pathway by
which insulin may contribute to cancer progression; however,
insulin is expected to activate multiple pathways in cancer
cells (25). Further understanding of the direct action of insulin
on prostate cancer cells may provide important insight into
new therapeutic strategies to prevent progression of CRPC.
Results of our study suggest that metabolic dysfunction of
prostate cancer patients should be addressed. There are a
number of pharmacologic agents currently available for the
treatment of insulin resistance that can improve (reduce)
circulating insulin levels including metformin, and recent
studies suggest that targeting insulin resistance can have
positive effects on cancer patient outcomes including prostate

cancer (46). Upstream inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis such
as the thiazolidinediones have been shown to be effective
insulin sensitizers and, in cancer, decrease androgen production in H295 cells by downregulation of CYP17A1 and HSD3B2
(47) and reduce cancer cell proliferation (48). Patients who are
undergoing cholesterol-lowering treatment with the statin
class of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA inhibitors show
markedly lower PSA levels and tumor volumes (49). Currently,
ADT-induced hyperinsulinemia is not addressed in prostate
cancer patients, despite a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in these patients (50); however, we
provide further evidence that management of the metabolic
consequences of ADT may be as important as treatment of the
cancer itself.
